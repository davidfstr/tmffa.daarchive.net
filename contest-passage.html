<p>
<big><big>Passage One</big></big>
<p>
"Ryo -- Ryouko?" he stammered out, taking a hasty step back. The cyan haired
pirate narrowed her eyes dangerously. Faster than the eye could follow, she'd
grabbed his neck with her right hand and lifted him a good three feet off
of the ground.
<p>
"My name is 'Zero'. Got it?" she asked, shaking him a little. The man gurgled,
beating ineffectually at Ryouko's hand. She cocked an eyebrow, then dropped
the large owner on his rear.
<p>
"Wha -- What do you want, Ryou -- " he began, until one of his bar stools
imbedded itself in the wall just above his head. "Uh -- That is, Zero."
<p>
"Information, what else?" Ryouko said, reaching behind the bar for a jug
of sake, oblivious to the murderous stare she was getting from the owner.
"And everyone knows that if 'Chief' doesn't know about it, it isn't happening."
<p>
<big><big>Passage Two</big></big>
<p>
After Tokimi picked herself up from her facefault, stalked toward them, her
previous anger nothing compared to this.
<p>
&lt;&lt;I did this because...&gt;&gt;
<p>
Washuu and Tsunami nodded, "Because?"
<p>
&lt;&lt;Because...&gt;&gt;
<p>
"Uh huh?"
<p>
Suddenly the goddess collapsed to her knees, crying her little heart out.
&lt;&lt;Because you left and didn't tell me where you were going! Big
meanies!&gt;&gt; And just as suddenly the force around the other two vanished
leaving the other two free to move. Tsunami moved to embrace Tokimi, followed
closely by Washuu.
<p>
Tsunami held her close. "Oh...I'm sorry. I never realized..."
<p>
"Nor did I." Washuu added.
<p>
&lt;&lt;Left me all alone...&gt;&gt;
<p>
<big><big>Passage Three</big></big>
<p>
Gen slowly regained conscienceness and his senses. He shook his head and
looked to see where Ryoko had gone since he was still alive. He saw her hunched
over the earthling boy he had captured.
<p>
Ryoko was so engrossed in caring for Tenchi that she never knew Gen was up
and walking towards her.
<p>
"Tragic," he muttered. &lt; She used to be so good in a fight. But now she's
so enraptured with this boy that she's let her guard down completely. &gt;
He sighed. &lt; What would make her risk her life for him? Oh well, it just
makes my job easier. &gt;
<p>
Gen approached Ryoko stealthily until he was standing only a few feet from
her. He drew his arm back, activated his energy-sword, and swung.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Four</big></big>
<p>
All in all, she was downright gorgeous. In fact, Tenchi found her to be *very*
attractive, even the oval markings on her face were cute. However, she did
just burst out of his water bottle, and he expected an explanation. He just
needed to ediscover the capacity to speak.
<p>
As Tenchi watched, trying to form cognitive thought, the girl looked about
the room curiously. Then, her eyes fell on him. She brightened considerably,
much to Tenchi's secret pleasure. "Hello!" She said cheerfully, "Are you
Misaki Tenchi?"
<p>
Tenchi could only nod in response.
<p>
The girl smiled, "Good! I'm Skuld, from the Goddess Relief Office." She stated
this as though it would instantly answer all possible questions.
<p>
Well, it would, if one had any clue as to what she was talking about. Tenchi
didn't. "Huh?" He managed, though his brain was still working through a few
over-used defense mechanisms dealing with sudden shocks.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Five</big></big>
<p>
Tsunami? What's the way? How can I help Tenchi-niichan be happy?
<p>
You could try to be there for him. You could show him that not all girls
want to fight over him, that some want to care about his feelings.
<p>
... what are you talking about, Tsunami?
<p>
You know what I'm talking about, Sasami-chan.
<p>
No. No! I ... I don't want to do that! I don't want to treat Tenchi like,
like --
<p>
Like Ayeka-neesan's headband?
<p>
Yes!
<p>
The one you sent him to steal?
<p>
Yes ...
<p>
Do you like taking things from your sister?
<p>
No! I mean, yes, I mean ... I mean, Tenchi-niichan isn't a thing! I don't
want to treat him like a thing! I ... I *love* Tenchi-niichan! I don't ever
want to hurt him like that! Why are you asking me this Tsunami? Why are you
making me think these things?
<p>
<big><big>Passage Six</big></big>
<p>
&gt;&gt;"Grrrrrr... What do you mean? I would never do such a thing I<br/>
&gt;wouldn't want to have the body of a tainted character of your
reputation"<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;"Well, how bout if I taint your reputation with Tenchi? Heh heh,
A<br/>
&gt;&gt;crack of the whip sounds fun."<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;"You wouldn't dare..."
<p>
Lina (imitating Ayeka/Stan): Oh, yeah, well I can beat up your little sorry
ass you fat-head!
<p>
A-ko (imitating Ryoko/Cartman): Oh, yeah, you fat bitch, at least IIII have
your body, you little twerp!
<p>
Andrew/Keiichi: Don't tell me this is happening...
<p>
<big><big>Passage Seven</big></big>
<p>
"So, what is it you wanted to show me?" he asked.
<p>
"This, Tenchi."
<p>
Ryoko grabbed him with one arm, and with the other began to tear his shirt
off his body. She dropped the tattered remnants of cloth on the floor. He
struggled, but she was much stronger than he was.
<p>
"Stop! You promised! YOU PROMISED!"
<p>
She spun him around forcefully and kissed him despite his attempt to turn
his face away. Her tongue entered his mouth, and she moaned.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Eight</big></big>
<p>
"Tell me, my dear, about this boy named after heaven and earth. Is his love
really worth these tears, this pain, this sadness? Is he really all of heaven
and earth to you?"
<p>
I thought about. I tried so hard to find it in me to say no, summoning the
image of Tenchi-sama holding that monster woman and whispering things I had
once dreamed he would tell me someday, tried so hard to tell myself that
that dream could no longer have any hope of being more than just that dream,
but I couldn't find it in myself to be angry. All I could feel was sorrow
and shame for a shortcoming that must've been in me. What made me inferior
to that monster woman, I didn't know, but that I, Aeka the first princess
of Jurai, for all my honorable propriety and the glory of my blood was somehow
less than a unversal criminal.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Nine</big></big>
<p>
The wind picked up to a savage roar and threw Tenchi Masaki backwards against
the wall as a horde of blazing eyes closed in, and he swallowed heavily,
throwing every ounce of his strength into the dim shield of jurai power he
had manifest.
<p>
He just prayed that the girls were alright...Ryoko haddn't looked well, and
Aeka had been staggering, bleading from a dozen wounds..Mihoshi had fallen
in the first wave of the assault, Sasami was missing and Washuu was
incoherant...dazed.
<p>
Things looked very bad.
<p>
Thunder slamed into his light hawlk wings in a thousand vollies, blasting
him throught the wall of the shrine and tumbling him back into the cave,
where they would have to make their last stand.
<p>
The enemy folowed, a vicious, evil horde of tiny bodies and vicious teeth
who's terrifying battle cry rang out in a thousand repititions of "Miyah"
<p>
<big><big>Passage Ten</big></big>
<p>
The trip to Tokyo was turning out to be a rather pleasant one. Ryoko had
fallen fast asleep when they had boarded the bus and had leaned on Tenchi's
shoulder the entire time. The earlier train ride had been a lively conversation
between the two of them. Ryoko had actually seemed interrested in knowing
more about Tenchi. It had always seemed to him that she had just wanted him
without knowing anything about him. Now she wanted to know everything from
what he wanted to do when he was older to how he was doing in school. She
was a wholly different person. If it hadn't been so nice he would have been
waiting for the other shoe to drop.
<p>
Now they were traveling through the Nerima district on their way to their
hotel. It was a quiet place that seemed like it hadn't yet advanced to the
twentieth century. Everywhere he looked people were wearing traditional clothing.
In fact, if you had removed his father and the horde of visiting aliens his
house would probably have fit in quite well around here.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Eleven</big></big>
<p>
'Surely the gods must love me,' thought Ayeka in an euphoric haze.
Serendipitously she and Tenchi had been left alone together on a beautiful
spring day. Tenchi had been pleasantly surprised and delighted at her bringing
a picnic lunch out to the carrot field where he had spent the morning working.
Even now they lay side-by-side on their picnic blanket watching the sun shine
on the lake below. The remains of their picnic lunch were spread out on the
grass of the hill side along with their clothes. The breeze felt good, cooling
the sweat that clung to her body after their recent exertion. This time it
was so much sweeter and intense than the first time they had done it. Ayeka
smiled. They were getting quite good at it. She never dreamed she would enjoy
sex so much.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Twelve</big></big>
<p>
Aeka and Ryoko collectively fumed at the handwritten note Tenchi left on
the dining room table.
<p>
"Hi,<br/>
Eloped with Sasami. Don't come looking for us.<br/>
~Tenchi
<p>
P.S. Ryo-Ou-Ki decided to come with us as well.<br/>
~Sasami
<p>
"How dare they!" Aeka growled.
<p>
"And just before dinner, too!" Ryouko added.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Thirteen</big></big>
<p>
When Tenchi woke up, the first sensation he felt was a pain all along his
exposed back. He raised his head and looked behind him to see that his entire
back was sunburned. He gazed up at the sun, which was now beginning to sink
below the horizon, and checked his watch. They had been sleeping for close
to five hours.
<p>
Below him, Washu stirred. She opened her green eyes and smiled coyly. "Hello
there," she said. "Did we oversleep?"
<p>
Tenchi smiled back at her. "You have nothing to worry about," he said in
a mock heroic voice, "Tenchi, the human sun block, has shielded your delicate
skin from the sun's harmful rays."
<p>
<big><big>Passage Fourteen</big></big>
<p>
"I was looking for the toilet!" Mihoshi cried, tears filling her eyes.
<p>
"You are a Federation saboteur!" Marik shouted.
<p>
"No, I'm a Galaxy Police Officer." Mihoshi pouted. "I told Captain Kila that...
you can ask her. She'll vouch for me."
<p>
"Gah!" Marik cursed, the force of the outburst propelling him backwards through
the room. "I never would have believed that a Federation saboteur could be
so aggravating!"
<p>
<big><big>Passage Fifteen</big></big>
<p>
"My son, your alien friends were just that. Alien. The products of a society
and evolution completely different from anything on Earth. No matter how
human they look, the most barbaric gaijin has more in common with you and
me than they do."
<p>
"But why didn't you tell me?" Tenchi asked. Now that he was thinking about
it, he could remember other times the girls had done things no human would
do. What human would just walk up to someone and call them a "guinea-pig
for my experiments?" Would take being stranded on Earth in stride. For that
matter, what human would stick themselves in stasis, on the off chance that
someday, maybe, the ship would pass close enough to their nemesis to revive
them?
<p>
"Because as I said before, I didn't realize the extent of it. I knew they
could get obsessive, but some humans can be too." Noyuboki replied. "But
this, this total lack of comprehension for the existence of life outside
themselves . . . you understand. Or rather, neither of us understand."
<p>
<big><big>Passage Sixteen</big></big>
<p>
"Come on, sit next to me." Ayeka patted the mat next to her.
<p>
"My pants are too wet."
<p>
Ayeka stood up and faced Tenchi, "take them off."
<p>
"I'm not wearing anything underneath, I'll just go stand outside."
<p>
Ayeka moved between Tenchi and the door. "It's raining to hard to be out
there." Ayeka kissed Tenchi. "I want you to stay with me." She put her arms
around Tenchi.
<p>
Tenchi tried to pull away "Ayeka, I cant...."
<p>
Ayeka caught his belt-loops with one hand and touched his lips with her
forefinger. "Shh. I know you don't want to choose; and I'm not asking you
to. I just want you to give me some time." Ayeka kissed Tenchi, pushing him
against the wall. She pulled open the front of his jeans and reached inside
them.
<p>
<big><big>Passage Seventeen</big></big>
<p>
"Commander Mihoshi," the officer reported. "The Shikuudan is accelerating
towards us! They are ignoring our communiques!"
<p>
"Open fire at once!" Mihoshi ordered. "Broadcast on all channels! Shikuudan
you are under arrest, the charge of resisting arrest will be added to the
list of charges against you if you do not stop!"
<p>
The Galactic Police ships fired upon the enormous horseshoe crab shaped ship
with two gigantic long back swept crescent shaped pectoral and dorsal fin
sections. The tiny concentrated beams struck the mammoth ship but did nothing
more than create pretty color patterns in the ship's shields as the cyclopean
crustacean continued to close rapidly. Within another second, the ship had
smashed straight through the center of the ships in a series of explosions
and scattered wreckage, leaving only nine of the battlecruisers and seven
support ships intact. Of the ships that were intact, all the support ships
and two of the battlecruisers were so badly damaged they were still spiralling
out of control from the collision.
<p>
"I would stop and chat if I had time!" Andrea exclaimed. "But I have all
of Kagato's work to steal and greater power to attain!"
<p>
Andrea looked back forward at the screen and laughed. Her expression turned
from one of amusement to one of concern. "I hope another pirate hasn't found
his stuff and is stealing what is rightfully mine. Oh well, if they are,
then I can destroy them and steal it back." Andrea sighed. "How inconvenient."
<p>
<big><big>Passage Eighteen</big></big>
<p>
"And what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?" Yosho asked without skipping
a beat. Tsunami simply pointed toward the far row of books in the corner
on a dusty shelf Yosho hadn't even glanced at for several months. Sitting
there was an acient book that Yosho was sure he had never seen before. "Hmm,
a present?" Yosho strolled over to the previously unoticed volume and read
the cover. It was printed in an acient version of the royal Jurian high speech.
Yosho immedately picked up the book and started reading, intriuged at the
new finding and wondering why this book was importiant enough for Tsunami
to drop here.
<p>
As Yosho read, he forgot about his tea and the time for that matter. He read
late into the evening and did not return to the house until 11 that night.
As he walked in the door, Washu was there waiting for him. "She visited you
too?" She asked in a tone that sugested these events seemed like elements
in an experiment rather than situations in life. Of course, with Washu, life
itself was on continuous expierement. Yosho nodded and handed the book over
to her. She took one glance and said, "I've read this before. I found it
when I was cleaning out my files concerning Juraian legends. If Tsunami thought
it was importiant enough to bring to our attention, the something has to
be up."
<p>
<big><big>Passage Nineteen</big></big>
<p>
He grinned as he stood, hand in pocket, shoulder on wall, missing only the
cigarette in mouth to make him look like a Tenchi-fied Humphrey Bogart.
<p>
Ayeka blushed. She had never seen Nobuyuki so, what was the word, interested.
<p>
"Hey, Ayeka," he said slickly, "today's your lucky day."
<p>
"Whatever do you mean, father?"
<p>
"Today's the day that your love for me is finally acknowledged." Grin became
more pronounced.
<p>
Ayeka gasped as would be expected. "Father Nobuyuki, I don't know what you
mean!"
<p>
"Oh, I'm not Nobuyuki, sweetbuns," he laughed. "I'm Tenchi, your dream beau!
Washu performed a little experiment on me, and now I'm a grown man who can
appreciate your love as well as your loins."
<p>
Ayeka screamed as would also be expected. "How dare you make up such a story,
Nobuyuki! Please, leave me alone before I call your son!"
<p>
<big><big>Passage Twenty</big></big>
<p>
"Tenchi?"
<p>
"Kiyone," Tenchi whispered, leaning in closer to her, "I brought you here
because I didn't want all the noise and interruptions that we would get with
the others back on Earth. There's something important that I just have to
tell you. You're the most special woman that's ever come into my life. I've
never admired anyone as much as you."
<p>
Tenchi took one of Kiyone's hands into his. "You're strong, compassionate,
and ... and beautiful. I love you, Kiyone."
<p>
Kiyone gasped. Tenchi moved even closer to her. She could see a mixture of
hope and fear in his eyes.
<p>
"You don't have to say anything," Tenchi murmured, "I ... I just wanted to
tell you. I'll take you home if that's what you want."
<p>
Kiyone couldn't believe that this was happening. Tenchi had never shown any
interest in her before! How long had he been keeping these feelings a secret?
