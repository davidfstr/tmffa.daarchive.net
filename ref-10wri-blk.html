Okay people, let's face it. Sooner or later, it's gonna come while you're
writing a fanfic (especially the long ones!). Hopefully it's temporary and
short but sometimes, it can get really bad. Yes: the dreaded writer's block.
<p>
Actually, it can just be because the computer won't start, your brother is
playing that radio so loud that your ears are ringing, or that aerobics class
has left your body in pain.
<p>
This type of situation is a little bit easier to work with. Go to the library
where they have working computers and there's peace and quiet. If you're
tired, don't push it. Rest today and write tomorrow.
<p>
Then there's the situation where you don't know what to write anymore. When
it seems like you have run dry on ideas, here are a few techniques to help
you get started again.
<ol>
<li>
    Thinking positively is a must. Block out all those 'I'm not good enough'
    or 'I have no imagination' ideas. Negative thoughts are the worst so believe
    in yourself! We all know you can write, so write!
  <li>
    When you are working, have a spearate sheet of paper next to you. When anything
    negative comes up that disrupts your free-flow of writing, write them down.
    You don't have to deal with them. Acknowledging their presence just helps.
  <li>
    Your present mood will always affect the story. Most of the time, it's best
    when you're relaxed. Sometimes, that's all you need to start writing again.
  <li>
    Make an outline of all the events. Figure out an ending already, before you
    even begin to write, so you'll know where the story is headed.
    Make-up-as-you-go-along fanfics can fun but they can become pretty hard to
    deal with later.
  <li>
    When you brainstorm for ideas use plain paper (not lined!) so you can give
    your ideas room to breathe. It's okay if they're scattered, don't make sense,
    or have no conncetion. You can figure out their viability later.
  <li>
    As the day comes to an end and you're still at the computer, don't finish
    the scene. Leave something to return to the next day even if it's just half
    a sentence. Have something to start with for the next time you start writing.
  <li>
    If you are stuck in a particular scene, leave it and go to a scene which
    you are confident of. Return to it later when you feel ready.
  <li>
    One word: Coffee.
  <li>
    Remind yourself why you want to write so you can be more enthusiastic about
    finishing your story. Fans can be major encourgement factors. Talk to people
    about your story. You can even write a list of all the reasons you want to
    write.
  <li>
    If all else fails, give yourself a break. Let your brain rest. Forget about
    the story and do something fun, preferably physical. After all, you can always
    return to it later. Try not to let this develop into procrastination though.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
So people, remember patience and perseverance! But it's okay if it takes
you 10 years to write as long as you're enjoying yourself. It is a fanfic
that you want to make for fun. You don't have a deadline so there's no pressure.
<p>
Good luck!
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
