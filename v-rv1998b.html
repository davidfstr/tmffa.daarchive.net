I commend you on the way your site is constantly updated with great FanFics.
I find that most of the authors put allot of thought and effort into thier
fics... especially in thier perception of each character. My favorite being
Ryoko, I find that I am not alone when I wish to see Tenchi and Ryoko get
together. Also to those who write the lemons, though they are quite amusing,
your talents might be better attuned to making the Tenchi universe more in
depth with out using sex as the underlying plot. Dont tak too much of this
to heart.... and thanks for the hours of interesting reading!<br/>

There are many well-written stories, but these happened to be among those
I particularly enjoyed reading more than once. SurReal World is listed since
it features Washu and it's a pity her role was not larger. You can find it

I really don't think it's fair for people to promote their own works on the
Voting list. This is a place to let OTHERS know how you feel about THEIR
work, not to promote your own. Heck, if that were the case, I'd have voted
for my own. But the fact is hat when you vote for your own its an empty vote
that takes away rank from others on the list, and that's just rude. Sorry
to take up space with this but I had to say that. Gomen Gensao.<br/>

I Love these stories because they really grasp the whole meaning behind Tenchi.
Not the sexual stuff. But The story behind Ryoko and how much she truly loves
Tenchi. I think they are a GREAT stories and cant wait for the next
Chapter!<br/>

Aikan Muyo because I think it's the best written and most powerfully emotional
story I have ever read. Ryoko's Love because Ryoko wins Tenchi and there's
nothing i'd like more than to see Tenchi and Ryoko together. A Very Tenchi
Chrismas because I thought it was the most heart-warming, tear-jerking story
I have ever read. The Continuation because it was a very satisfying ending
to the OVA storyline and because Ryoko wins Tenchi. Death of a Scientist
because it was well written and engrossing. The Ball beca se, you guessed
it, Ryoko wins Tenchi.<br/>

It was a close call between Aikan Muyo! and Ryoko's Love but Chapter #10
of A. Muyo! decided the winner for me. Happosai, you are living proof that
Tenchi will never die as long as dedicated fans such as you still exist.
Ryoko's Love fufilled my wish that Tenchi would find some sense in his head
after all. The characters are very 3-dimensional and... aw hell! I just adore
Ryoko! A Very Tenchi Christmas really pulled on my heartstrings. I shed a
tear for Tenchi as he witnessed Washu's gift.<br/>

Ryoko's Love: Nice for all us Ryoko fans, nice characterization. Aikan Muyo:
Good in-depth analysis of personalities and emotions, though it's horribly
depressing at times. The Ball: A nice, conclusive story. Meaning, a Ryan
Anderson story that ENDS, thank god. It is a happy conclusion to the plots
started since episode one of the OVA's, wrapping up the storyline nicely
as a look into the personality of Tenchi (plus, Ryoko w ns). The Tenchi
Chronicles: Also good characterization, excellent portrayal of Tenchi. Kiyone's
Leave: A good story about one of the less used characters in the Tenchi Universe.
The Continuation: An all-around quality story that concludes the Lady Tokimi
plot and sheds light on several of the mysteries surrounding Tenchi (plus,
again, Ryoko wins.)<br/>

I just love BGlander's works! It's so dark, yet it makes you wonder and then
REALIZE that it could happen in the Tenchi world. BGlander keeps the charecter's
personalities, and exposes their inner thoughts as they never showed in the
show and movies. Yet, it is exactly as I would imagine it to be, as far as
the way everyone thinks, Ryoko excpecially (as her hidden love for Tenchi
is done perfectly in action and thought). I just have one thing to say to
BGlanders, which is: GET THOSE LAST TWO DONE NOW!!!! I'm eagerly awaiting
them! (But don't hurry too much, or it will have that hurried, not as well
done as it could be look) I am definatly going to read the rest.<br/>

So many good ones, it was hard to choose. Anyway, needless to say, I'm a
Ryouko fan. =) But I do like fanfics which explore all the characters, extending
them beyond what any canonical Tenchi source has yet done. Aikan Muyo, despite
being a lemon, has som of the best writing and characterizations (and humor)
in any fanfic I've ever read. As K.T. Vogt would say, "More Aikan!"<br/>

I don't know very much about Tenchi...I've just seen one of the OAV's and
read a couple mangas my friend has. So, the only way I can really follow
a Tenchi fic is if it has elements in it that are familiar to me. Ranma 1/2
happens to be the series I kno most about. Also, I like the way Ranma has
developed in this story. By that, I mean adjusting to his female form. Anyways,
I really liked the story.<br/>

that as a whole, none of the votes for the ryoko's love series have been
from any members of the ML; they ave all come from the outside. i find this
interesting; could it be that ML members have a higher intolerance for sloppy

Aikan Muyo! That's all that needs said about that one. The best series out
there. Connections I liked because of the humor. Ryoko Profiles touched me
deeply (Damn good BGlanders). Mirai; what can I say I like the idea of Ryouko
getting Tenchi. Opera ive and the School Girl; highly original. Wasuremono;
I dislike any story where Sasami or Washuu gets Tenchi for the reasons this
story very accurately portrayed; yes all is fair in love and war, but only
if you are willing to pay the price. The price ould be very high. Good job
everyone let's keep going.<br/>

Well, the first two were my favorites because I am a HUGE Kiyone fan and
I am so happy to finally see some fanfic writers giving her a break. (What
would my parents say if they knew the girl I wanted to marry was a cartoon
character....) While I think t at either Kiyone or Sasami (or maybe both!
Now THAT is something to write a lemon about!) should get Tenchi), Ryoko's
Love is an excellent depiction of how things would go if Tenchi married the
space pirate (although I question whether Ayeka would be so c lm about it).
Tenchi Muyo Universe is wonderfully detailed, and The Poisoning of a Pioneer
Exec. was just hilarious. I am one of those who think that the naming decision
for that movie was extremely dumb (it practically gives the whole story away).
'Cour e, another dumb decision on Pioneer's part was withholding Tenchi Universe
Vol. 8 till after Xmas. What the hell was that for?! They would made a bundle!
But I digress, so....<br/>

Ryoko to Tenchi, it doesn't matter what you write, everyone will love it!
Still, it IS well done. A very Tenchi Christmas made me cry like no other
fanfic. A beautiful masterpiece. Ryan Anderson is always good. The continuation
is also interesting. The grass is always greener had to be in the list, 'cause
IT'S SO DARN FUNNY! Oh well, bet I forgot to mention someone...<br/>

Nice to watch a developing young author whose effort is demonstrated via

of his developing story is evident in his composition. [First steps fumbled,

Kiwanichiwa! ^_^ I love Tenchi!!! I'm in it!
&lt;--not really, (but my name is). Not only Ayeka and Ryoko have feelings for
him...but I love Tenchi Muyo!! And Ryoko's Love is the most interesting FF
I have ever read!  Just the plot and it's sub-stories tha comes into place..it
begins to slowly unfold as the plot thickens...(whatever that may be) It
keeps me on my toes and interested...there's drama, comedy, humor, and sigh..&lt;3.love...It's
a continued version of Tenchi Muyo that fulfills my need until "my s
ow" comes back on! It's nicely written, and very appropriate, I *LOL* so
many times, that it made me roll around the floor (my dog, Fuji, joined with
me)!  I thought it is nicely written focusing on the characters as they were
meant to be portrayed, even 
hough my "sister" didn't get to go on a date with Tenchi, it was still a
good FF. Besides, Ayeka sure does boss people around alot...what do you expect
from the crown Princess of Jurai? Also, I wasn't in it that much either..(I
will hafto send one of my 
omplaints to the author about that)...but, it is nicely written. Alot of
good thoughts and ideas went into the story, and I know it will go far...too
bad for the Pioneer-Anime people..they don't know who the writer is, it would
be such a good blessing if hey offer him the job as a writer, he's got some
fresh ideas!!  As, for THE BALL, that was nicely written also. It holds some
really good ideas about the planet of Jurai, and the people's background
and all. I liked that one to. Those top my list!! But 'm leaning more on
Ryoko's Love. It just seems "right". ^_^<br/>

\\// Aikan Muyo has to be the best I have read, not because it's lemon at
all, but because it's a wonderf l story. I'm hoping the authors of "Tenchi
Chronicles" and "Very tenchi Christmas" pick up the pen again....their stories
were excellent. I love the other fanfics as well! Good luck to all!<br/>

Aikan Muyo! was the first Tenchi fanfic I ever read and it's emotion and
plot is wonderful. I'm anxiously waiting for the next chapter to be finished.
Ryoko's Love just confirmed the fact that Tenchi and Ryoko were meant for
each other. And it proves that nothing, not even death can keep Ryoko down.<br/>

I loved Ryoko's Love because Tenchi marrys Ryoko and they have a daughter.
Its one of the best Fan Ficts. Also I helped preread it. Aikan Muyo because
Tenchi finally falls in love with the two women in his life. Its a great
story. A Very Tenchi Christmas because its the best holiday Fan fic it should
be a Christmas Special. The rest of them are all personal favorites of mine.
You should check them out.<br/>

What can I say? Ryoko's Love is one of the best FF's out there. I like this
series becuase it's bold and innovative. It's all in character (sort of.)
and has very unique story telling. The grammar and writing sucks but from
what I can read from his ne est entry, 'Chapter 1A: friendly wager'. The
grammar and tenses has improved dramatically! For those who probably dumped
this series, give it another chance! The author's writing has improved! Aikan
muyo is a superb series I love it for it's drama an character developments.
Can't wait til the next chapter! In a way, I think Aikan Muyo and Ryoko's
Love are the best FF series out there, but I also see other great potential
FF writers as well...<br/>

"The Ball"- Great fic... loved it... Tenchi chose Ryoko, the one he SHOULD

well written and just... i dunno... hit you, y'know? "A VERY Tenchi Christmas"-
What can I say about this? I loved it the first time I read it, one of the
first Tenchi fics I'd ever read, and I STILL love it. "Sasami Gets Tenchi"-
Again... Sasami's just SDC: So Damned Cute. You can't help but root her on
when she's after Tenchi. "Kiyone Masaki"- This one was well written. I did
like the prospect of Kiyone and Tenchi getting together... even if they didn't
STAY together. :P (DAMN!) "An Evaluation of the Events..."- If this is the
one I'm thinking of, which I hope it is... then this should be the one wherein
Tenchi meets Ryoko again, a while after the end of the series. Full of
sentimental mushy crap, which I'm a sucker for. This fan ic ruled. And on
top of all that, the whole gang comes back and gets together! WOO! Thanks,
Mark Eymer<br/>

I had a hard time choosing a number 1, so I left that slot intentionally
blank. The ones I listed are all equally good, with just a slight bit of
variance between slots. /// The scary thing about Blink of an Eye is that
this could actually happen in the Universe continuity. That's why I loved
it. /// Wasuremono, despite the obvious problem of Kiyone in the OAV continuity,
is also a well-written piece of work (I seem to have a penchant for the darker
fics). The ending just begs for a sequel recounting the aftermath. /// Ryouko's
Love... I absolutely am enthralled with the concept; it's got a great plot,
and I've been creating my own permutations in wait of the next part. Yes,
the grammar is flat-out *bad* (especially the tense-crossings), but I'm working
on it... /// Who doesn't like Aikan Muyo? (ok, ok, aside from Acid Tenchi
when he read the unedited chapter 1 ;) Parts of it are a bit silly, but this
is probably what Tenchi would be like if he weren't so damned hormone-lacking
in the "real" continuities ;) /// Death of a Scientist would make a good
OAV. A dilemma, a plot, a new character, a good resolution, and a surprising
appearance. Plus it's well-written, which is always good. /// I hope that
feedback was well-taken. Hope to see more (GenSao, 'twould be a good idea
to link it from the fanfic.html if you get my drift ;)<br/>
