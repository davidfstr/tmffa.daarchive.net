      Here are a few guideline you should follow while chatting in #TenchiFF. These
      rules will be generally enforced. Ops have my backing, as agents, in their
      final decision on the interpretation and enforcement of these rules.</p></td>

<p>
<big><big>Purpose</big></big>
<p>
These rules were established in order to allow writers and readers a forum
where they can freely discuss topics of related interest. If anyone is found
disturbing this tranquility, they jeopardize their position to chat in #TenchiFF.
<p>

<p>
The following are generally not allowed in the chat room.  Anyone breaking
these guidelines will first receive a warning. Repetitive breaking of
these guidelines will result in temporary expulsion from the room. In severe
cases, a person will be banned for a prolonged amount of time.
<blockquote>
<big>Advertising/Spamming</big>
<p>
  Any form of commercial/wares/porn advertisement is strictly prohibited and
  is grounds for immediate kicking.  Repetitive abuse with result in a
  ban.  Promotion of one's own site and/or story is somewhat allowed,
  but to a certain extent. Repetitive advertising will be frowned upon and
  can result in kicking and at very worse banning.
  <p>
<big>Profanity/Behavior</big>
<p>
  #TenchiFF is a room for serious discussion. Anything that detracts from this
  will be greatly frowned upon.  Thus, the use of profanity is generally
  NOT allowed. Inappropriate behaviour and actions such as flaming and
  harassing is also unwelcome.
  <p>
<big>Useless Dialog/Scripts</big>
<p>
  Excessive rambling is not welcomed.  Just saying "I am bored", "Someone
  talk", or just typing for the fun of it, is not productive and doesn't help.
   If the room is silent, it is because no one want to chat at the moment
  or no one is there. Severe color or script usage is also prohibited. You
  should also check if it is ok before copying and pasting lots of text in
  the chat widow.
  <p>
<big>Role Playing</big>
<p>
  Role playing is generally allowed for only short bursts in the main room,
  but extended ones (can span several hours) should be transferred to the secondary
  channel, #TenchiRPG. Role playing during a discussion is unwarranted
  and takes away from the debating.  Please also start extended RPGs in
  #TenchiRPG.  It will save you a lot of trouble.
  <p>
<b>NOTE: </b> A short RPG is defined to be less than 30 minutes.
  RPG sessions longer than an hour are considered long RPGs and should be
  transferred to #TenchiRPG.
  <p>
<big>Clones</big>
<p>
  You may not have a clone in #TenchiFF. They do not add anything to
  discussions. Clones will be automatically kicked from #TenchiFF. Clones
  are permitted in #TenchiRPG only for role playing. Overall clones eat up
  resorces that would fill up the server.
  <p>
<big>Ask and thou shall not receive.</big>
<p>
  Please do not ask for Ops status. These are given as needed and designated
  by current ops.
  <p>
<big>Ban Avoiding</big>
<p>
  Attempting to intentionally avoid a ban is the same as breaking out of prison
  or resisting arrest. This behavior will not be tolerated! It will most likely
  extend your ban if not make it more permanent.
</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></blockquote>
<p>
<big><big>Reporting Violations</big></big>
<p>
Anyone who finds another's actions intolerable in the channel can ask the
op staff for actions regarding this. If no op is available, log the offensive
dialogue and contact one of the ops or myself.
<p>
<big><big>Changes</big></big>
<p>
These guideline can be changed at any time, and should be followed upon
implementation.
