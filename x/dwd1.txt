	"Welcome Kento, I see you have come as I've asked," said a dark figure in the
shadows.  He stood behind a pedestal and gazed down at the lowly ronin at the
base of the pedestal.  The room was exceedingly dark and the room was full of
cloaked figures.  He looked up as if to speak.  "Silence mortal!!!" The
cloaked figure at the pedestal cried.
	A figure emerged from the shadows, "All new members are allowed to ask three
question.  Any insubordination will be punished.  Ask your questions now," the
shadow remarks.
	"I do have one.  Why are you guys wearing mouse ears and bras on your heads?"
	"That is insubordination, no more questions today.  You now have your first
task, bring use five non frat members, and none of those other three friends
of yours," the cloaked man stood there speaking now went into convulsive
laughter, "Member Beta Zeta, observe his test and make sure he does his own
dirty work for once."

There was a smell of grease and fast food filled the air like a foul perfume.
The smell gave way through the double doors as the smell was then matched with
that of cheap perfume.  The lights of signs stood glowing like hypnotic
beckons.  Signs of sales broke the almost alien atmosphere of the brightly lit
mall.  Serena looked around at the glorious shops and stores that all were
baring signs of sales.  "Amy why did you have to drag us to a chess match
today?" Serena asked Amy quietly.
"Come on Serena, she needs our support.  She is going against the reigning
champion of the city, two years in a row,"  Mina Remarked.
The group comes to a large open area, in the center sits a single chess board
in which crowds of people are around.  Banners are hang about that read "CHESS
CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH TODAY"
"Rei, do you remember my opponents name?"  Amy asked.
"One Rowen Hashiba of Shin-sha University."Rei Answered, "Don't worry you can
beat Frat boy there."

A group of sinister figures stand in watch as part of the crowd.  They look at
each other as if they have something to do in recent time to come. "Darkwolf,"
One says with a caw like a bird to his voice, "You think that the people we
are looking for are going to come here to a teenage chess tournament.  You
must be crazy.  We are looking for great heros, not little kiddies."
"Shut up Grayhawk, your mouth seems never to shut.  I'm sure, in fact two of
the people we're looking for are in this match," the one named Darkwolf
answered with a growl to his voice.
"Rampage don't care as long as Rampage get to beat something," A rather large
and barbaric looking man said rather primitively.
"Shut up!" Grayhawk and Darkwolf cried in unison.

______________________________________________________________________________

Two college student come to the open area of the mall but at the upper level.
They look down at the crowd and at the young girl taking a set at the black
side of the chessboard. "Pretty cocky opponent a Rowen,"Sage remarks.
"Pretty yes, cocky no.  I won last time on the white side so now I'm stuck as
white," Rowen answers.
"So I think you may be giving someone your number.  Aren't you?" Sage looks at
him doe eyed, in a mocking fashion.
"Ummm......Look there's Kento and Cye, lets go say hello,"Rowen answered just
barley dodging the question.
They looked down at the crowd of people and sure enough there was Cye and
Kento.  They walked toward the escalator only for a moment when over the loud
speaker "Rowen Hashiba please make your way over to the tournament board in
five minutes or you forfeit."
"Lets move it or your title goes to a high school student," Sage says to his
buddy in a frenzy.
"Your right.  To the chessboard!" Rowen says in his light Aussie accent.
They race down the escalator to the chessboard and Rowen takes his set in a
record twenty-five seconds. Sage went to the crowd and stood next to his
friends Kento and Cye.  "Cye where is Ryo?"Sage questioned quietly for the
match had just started.
"He's out with Mia somewhere.  They'll be here just in time for Rowen's famous
death blow," Cye remarks at the question asked by Sage.
"So you to are friend of the champion nice to meet you,"Mina says to Sage and
the rest.
"Mina.  What are you doing bothering them when their friend is losing,"Rei
remarked smartly.
"What? Rowen what do you think your doing, She's killing you," Sage mutters
aloud.
After some time Sage is on the ground in tears.  Rowen is continuing to lose
to Amy. The match looked sealed and it was. "What the heck is he doing?" Ryo
asked as he enters the group of low spirited ronins and high spirited school
girls.
"He's throwing the match," Sage said in a pool of tears, "I betted on Rowen
against the rest of the ferturnity."
"Check,"Amy said playfully.
"You mean Check-Mate,"Rowen corrected also in a playful manner.
"Your right,"Amy said as a roar came from the crowd and the sound of sobbing
came from Sage.  The two shock hands and went to their friends.  The great
moment was broken by a shrill scream from the crowd.
"What was that?"Rowen and Amy cried at the same time.
The crowd cleared to reveal three men standing there in full armor that
resembled animals.
"Welcome to a new championship, one between you ten and us.  We are the new
dark warlords,"One said, He appeared to be in armor that looked like that of a
vulture.
"Shut up you over dramatic fool,"Another said, he appeared to be in wolf like
armor, "I am Darkwolf, the over dramatic fool as I called him is Grayhawk, and
the simpleton is Rampage."
"Rampage not simple!!"Rampage screamed, Grayhawk grabbed him at the midriff of
his rhino armor.
"Save it," Darkwolf said calmly.
Suddenly another shrill voice filled the air, "A-ko look, Puppies!!!"
A young blonde teen-age girl goes running through the armored warriors
standing ready for battle.  As she runs she knocks over Rampage and forces
Grayhawk to let go.  She runs over to a pet store and picks up a small puppy.
"C-ko watch out!" a red haired girl shouts running after the little girl.
"That distracted them, ready guys?" Ryo shouts to the others.
"Wait what did he mean by ten of use?" Kento added.
Suddenly Serena leaped up and yelled, "Moon Prism Power!!!"
"Shot, what does little missy there think she's doing?" Sage laughs as he gets
out of a small puddle of tears.
"I think we've met our match guys," Ryo adds in, "Now guys take'em. Here's
your armor orbs."
All the guys take the armor orbs and ready them for the big battle.  They
throw their orbs into the air and jump into the light of them.  "Armor of the
wildfire, DAO JIN!!!!"
Suddenly, where was five college students stood, now stand five battle ready
samurai.
"Hey Kento look at the little school girls," Cye said pointing in the
direction of Serena and the other four girls.
"I think I'm in love,"Kento replied looking wide eyed at the girls.
"This is so degrading," Rei said with her head in her hands.
"Not to interrupt the party but can you please help here!" The red-haired girl
shouts at the ten warriors.
"She's right people we should help that little girl," Lika shouts to the rest.
"Your right Lika, you guys have to stop gawking at us and get to battle," Rei
shouts at the ronins looking them, then suddenly the ronins looked down and
were apologizing for their actions, then Rei just about had it, "GUYS GET THE
LEAD OUT!!!"
"She's right you know.  Lets teach these guys whose boss," Ryo shoots at the
ronins.
"Oh now ant that just quant. AAAAAHHHHHH....LIGHTNING STARS!!!!!"Grayhawk
screams at the top of his lungs, then a thousand Sparks fill the air as the
warrior appears to toss them.
"It must be a trick," Sage screams as the stars hurdle toward them.  He looks
in his sword and sees a thousand stars headed toward them, " It's not,
DUCK!!!"
At the same time over at the pet store Rampage is closing in on the little
girl.  She is screaming holding a puppy and backing into a corner.  "Rampage
smash, Rampage bash, Rampage... puppy, Rampage like puppy," Rampage said
holding out his hands reaching for the small dog, when suddenly the red-haired
girl appears and punches him in the gut.
"That's for trying to hurt my friend!!"She screams at the writhing mass below
her.
"Thank you A-ko!!"The little girl shouts in joy, then hugs her.
"Thanks C-ko."
Back out in the forum the group has it's hands full dodging thousands of
stars.  Rei, Lika, Cye and Sage had jumped up to the next level to divert his
fire.  Serena, Ryo, Kento, Mina, Amy, and Rowen where ready to fight back when
a voice came from Serena's bag, "Serena, you and your new friends must combine
powers. Amy and the dark blue one shout MERCURY ARROW at the same time."  A
small cat had been giving them directions.
"Why should I listen to a talking cat," Rowen said, "I should have laid off
the sokie last night."
"I'm no alcohol induced illusion,"The cat snapped, "It's your only hope at
this point."
"Okay, I'll do it, just let get my bow ready," Rowen mumbled.
"MERCURY ARROW!!!!" The two shout in unison and an arrow is shot from Rowen's
bow trailed by a line of bubbles. It hits Grayhawk and he freezes in place.
Darkwolf has his head berried in his hands.
"You may have bested those idiots, but we'll meet again and the odds will be
in our favor. SHOT, that idiots mellow dramatic attitude is rubbing off on
me," He and the rest of the evil warriors disappear.
"That was easy," Ryo said.
"Well there are ten of us.." Kento starts but is interrupted.
"You mean eleven," The red-haired girl said, "The names A-ko and this is C-
ko."
"Hi, I'm C-ko and I'm glad to meet you!!" The little girl shouts loudly.
"I'm Mina and I'm glad to meet you, too," Mina says, "This is Lika, Serena,
Amy, and this little jewel of personality is Rei."
"Nice to meet you."
"Hello."
"Hi."
"Swell," Rei says standing there looking in another direction
"I'm Ryo of the wildfire,"Ryo says to the rest of the people.
"I'm Rowen of the Strata."
"I'm Kento of Hardrock."
"Sage of the Halo."
"And I'm Cye of the Torrent."
At this point Rei is staring at Ryo, at that moment Mia came out of a near by
store with several bags in her hands.  She came over to the chess area totally
oblivious to what had just happened.  She takes one glace at Ryo in his armor
and drops her bags.  "Ryo what happened here and who are these, and why are
you guys wearing your armors?" Mia Question in sort of a puzzled fashion.
"Mia,"Ryo said quietly at Mia, "Excuse me Mia, did you miss the battle?"
"There was a fight? Ryo are you hurt?  Fill me in later Ryo let's go," Mia
said very quickly as she dragged him out the door.  At that point everyone
returned to normal.
"We'll all meet tomorrow, you seven should go home your parents must be
worried," Sage says pointing to the door.
"We should. So long, till tomorrow," Serena said as she walked toward the
exit.  As they leave Amy noticed a small piece of paper in her hands.  She
read what it said. It read "Call me" and had a phone number.  Amy ran to catch
up with her friends with the paper up against her chest.
"Tenchi, I knew we missed some thing.  I Remember those people that just past
use from some where," Said a girl that looked to be seventeen with hair that
looks like it was done by Sonic the Hedgehog.
"Your right Ryoko. But can't today be a normal day for once," said a young
man.
The girl looked at him and smiled. "Your right, lets go," the girl said but
she knew this was an omen of things to come.
