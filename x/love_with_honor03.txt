          Love With Honor

          A Gundam Wing and Tenchi Muyo crossover.

          As you know, I don&#8217;t own Gundam Wing or Tenchi
          Muyo.  But, the fic is
          mine.  On to the story!

          Chapter 3: Getting to Know One Another

               Ayeka swung her bo staff in the many different
          technics she had
          learned, trying to get her mind off Tenchi and Yosho.
           She looked at
          the glass objects infront of her, picking them up, she
          threw them in
          the air, calculating their movements, she used her bo to
          smash into
          each one and watched as they shattered, falling to the
          ground.
          "I will not be the weak princess I was once portrayed
          as."  She
          whispered.  "Chasing after my brother, then after
          Tenchi.  What was I
          thinking?"

              Wufei watched her.  Intrigued.  He never saw a woman
          train so
          much, not since Meiran.  She seemed to have a huge
          amount of anger,
          it consumed her greatly.  Next he watched as she swung
          her bo in a
          perfect routine, breaking ever single glass object.
           Flawless.  She
          was gasping when she was finished and stood up straight,
          staring at
          the ground.

             "Hey whatcha doing?"  Duo asked, coming up behind
          him.
          "Just watching her.  She has an interesting style."
           Wufei answered,
          leaning against the tree he was standing at.
          "Oh."  Duo raised his eyebrow, glancing at her, she was
          swinging her
          bo in perfect circles.

          "Princess."  Osaka and Kamadake called as they
          approached her.  "Your
          Sensei said it&#8217;s time for your next lesson."  They
          informed her.
          She nodded and followed them.

          "Gee.  I wonder how many lesson&#8217;s she has in one
          day."  Duo wondered
          out loud, scratching his head.
          Wufei watched her go, not saying anything.

          Later that evening........

               Ayeka walked out into the fields, and sat by a
          pond, looking at
          her reflection.  She looked at her hair, which was cut
          in her usual
          hair style.
          "Maybe I should let it grow out."  She thought, running
          a hand
          through it, remembering the time of her childhood, when
          she would
          follow Yosho, and how he said they would be married when
          she grew
          up.  But they never did.  And her told her he had no
          intention of
          returning.
          She sighed, closing her eyes, when she heard footsteps.
           Alarm spread
          threw her, in less than a minute she was on her feet,
          only to come
          face to face with Wufei.

                Duo walked through the palace, curious about the
          place.  He
          noticed the technology was unlike any he&#8217;d ever
          seen.  And the cloths
          were definitely different, strange material, designs and
          colors.  But
          the food tasted pretty good.  They had been on Jurai two
          days, and he
          was very confused as to how him and Wufei came to this
          planet.

               He entered a room that was full of waterfalls, and
          leaned
          against the railing, watching the water dance.
          "What are you doing in here?"  Said a voice.
          Duo turned around, finding two guys standing not to far
          from him.
          One was young with red hair, the other older with gray
          hair.  Both
          had very odd hairstyles.  Not only that, but the way
          they were
          dressed gave him the idea of them being some sort of
          guards.
          "Um, I was just walking around."  Duo shrugged.
          "No one is allowed in here without the permission of the
          Royal
          Family."  The older guard stated.
          Duo frowned.  "Well excuse me, I didn&#8217;t know."  He
          said sarcastically.
          "Just who are you anyway?"  The younger guard asked.
          "My name is Duo Maxwell, but you can just call me Duo.
           And who might
          you two be, never seen you around."
          "We are Osaka and Kamadake, Royal Guards to
          Jurai&#8217;s Royal Family."
          Kamadake replied.  "And we&#8217;ve just recently
          returned with Jurai&#8217;s
          Emperor."
