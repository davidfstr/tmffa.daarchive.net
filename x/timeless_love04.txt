       I do not own these characters, I did not create them, the only character I
can claim is Anya, Tenchi's wife, I thought of her on my own and did not copy
her from anything or anyone else.  I also did not create the Dragon Ball Z
characters. Please don't sue me!!!

       Ok, so it's been awhile since the last fan fic.  Therefore I'll go against my
usual beliefs and give  my faithful fans a quick review of what's going on, since
even I can't really remember! :)  Ok, think Dragonball Z, now think Trunks, as in
the possible future Trunks. Now think 2 years later in that possible future. A
plague  is killing many people and the plant called tyreen is the only known
antidote, unfortunately that plant has been extinct for about 100 years.  Trunks
goes back in time to find it, in another dimension, the Tenchi dimension, Washu
was trying to fix her old dimension machine and ended up creating a rip, Trunks
got stuck in it, and is currently staying with Tenchi at his house, he and Sasami
have fallen in love, and Trunks is just about to go back in time to get the plant,
come back, get Sasami, and then go to his time to save everyone...

       It was a sunny day, there were few clouds, and only the slightest of
breezes to make the trees sway.  At the Masaki household, things were not
nearly so peaceful.
       Trunks and Washu were going over the time machine, with Washu showing
him the added features she had put in.  Inside the house, Sasami was cooking
supper, dreaming of what Trunks' world must look like, and Anya, Tenchi, Aeka,
and Mr.Masaki were in the living room talking.  Tenchi's grandfather was at the
temple.
       " My Tenchi, it is amazing how many changes have occured since the last
time we talked."  Aeka said, sipping a cup of tea.
       " Yeah.  Who would have ever thought that Mihoshi and Kiyone would not
be partners anymore?  Or what happened to Ryoko..."  Tenchi cleared his
throat, and his wife Anya who was holding his hand, smiled at him.
       " Yes Tenchi, but Ryoko did what she did to save us.  I admit that I never
thought that the Galaxy Police would ever find her, but it had to happen
evantually.  I'm sure that wherever Ryoko is right now, she's save and happy."
       Tenchi and Mr. Masaki stared at Aeka, not believing that she would ever
have said such...nice things about Ryoko.  
       " Yes, a lot has changed" murmured Mr. Masaki.
             ****************************************************************************
       In the kitchen, Sasami was chopping up vegetables for supper.  The
thought that this could be one of the last times she ever cooked supper for
Tenchi made tears come to her eyes.  Quickly she brushed them from her eyes
and as she looked out the window above the sink, she caught site of Trunks. 
She smiled, he was looking terrified as Washu tried to lecture him on the
scientific principles of what she had newly installed in his time machine.  He
was leaving the next morning, to go and collect the plant for his future, then he
would come back, get Sasami, and they would go to his time.  Past that,
Sasami wasn't sure.  She knew that she loved Trunks, but what if she hated
where he lived? Or if her love for him couldn't outway her homesickness for Jurai
or Tenchi?  Did Jurai even exist where he lived?  These thoughts came to her so
suddenly that she sat down on the floor and burst into tears.  She d idn't even
notice when Aeka came in to see how she was doing.  As soon as she saw her
sister crying, the Empress of Jurai kneeled next to her and held her sister.  
       " What's wrong Sasami?"  She asked after a few minutes and Sasami's
sobs had quieted a little.
       " I don't know Aeka.  I love Trunks, but I don't know if I can live with him.
We're not planning to get married, and yet I can't just forget him and never see
him again! I'm so confused! What should I do Aeka?"  Fighting the urge to tell
Sasami that she should come with her back to Jurai, fighting the overwelmingly
sad thought of Sasami leaving, Aeka answered as best she could.
       " Follow your heart Sasami.  And if Trunks is your heart, then follow him." 
At her words, Sasami fell into silence, Aeka still holding her as Sasami
searched her heart.
       *********************************************************************************
       The next morning, after a quick breakfast, Trunks was saying his goodbyes
before he left.  First he said goodbye to Tenchi and Anya, then to Aeka, to
Washu, and finally to Sasami.  They didn't say anything, they just hugged each
other quickly.    
So Trunks climbed into his time machine, and waving, disappeared.
       Trunks had a good idea of where he was supposed to go, and what the
plant he was looking for looked like.  His mother, Bulma, had made sure that he
knew everything by heart.  Grinning to himself, he wondered what Bulma would
think of Sasami.  He was sure they would get along, and he wasn't worried
thought.  
       Cafeully he set the time and speed, then sat back, waiting for the machine
to find the place.  As he was thinking, the thought crossed his mind, that if
Sasami didn't like where he lived, then what? Or what if they're love didn't last?
He was not sure that he could get back to Tenchi's dimension.  And Trunks still
had not told Sasami about Gohan.  He had told her about his father, and
saiyans, and she had found them as strange as he found the idea of Juraians.  
       He broke his thoughts to land his machine.  He stepped out, and found
himself in a dense jungle.  Bewildered, he look around, not sure how he would
be able to find one type of plant among all these different kinds.  Carefully he
looked around, luckily the plant was common before it became extinct, and
about 20 minutes later, he had found the plant.  Not having expected to find it so
easily, he decided to explore for a few minutes.  Taking out his sword he
wandered around, always keeping the time machine in sight.  He came across a
lake of water.  It was hot in the jungle, and Trunks was thirsty.  As he kneeled
down to drink, he looked up and a ripple in the water moved toward him.  He
stared at it, wondering what had caused the ripple when suddenly a creature
jumped out of the water at him.  The creature had long sharp teeth, long arms,
short legs, with sharp, wicked looking claws on each h and and foot.  It slashed
at Trunks, who blocked the thing's arms with his sword.  The creature bit into
Trunks' arms and he cried out in pain.  His sword swung around and chopped
the creature's head off.  Shaking, one hand clutching his arm, he ran to the time
machine, got in, and headed back.
                   *************************************************************************
       Hearing the time machine, Sasami ran outside happily.  Or almost happily,
Aeka and Anya had helped her pack her things.  She had said goodbye to all of
them, including Tenchi, and wanted to leave before she changed her mind.
       The time machine appeared, the door opened, and...a bleeding Trunks fell
out.  Sasami ran to him, and Trunks told her what had happened.  Washu came
outside, and bandaged him.  Once that was all done, there was nothing left to
do except say goodbye, again.  Blinking back tears, she told them all goodbye,
promising to visit them again, as soon as she could.  Trunks thanked them for
everything, and together he and Sasami climbed into the time machine.
       " I can't wait to meet your mother, she sounds wonderful." Sasami finally
said to break the silence.  " What's she like?"  Grinning, Trunks answered, 
       " Imagine a slightly saner Washu."  then he laughed at the look on
Sasami's face and assured her that she would like Bulma.  Then, not even
planning to, he told her about Gohan.  She listened, and at the end, nodded, and
told him in turn about adventures she had had with Tenchi, the 'old days' she
called them.  They continued to talk for the rest of the journey.  Finally, each
decided that they had made the right choice.
       When they reached Trunks' time,  he landed the time machine in front of
his house and jumped out.  Sasami climbed out, and gasped as she tried to
look at all the strange things at once.  Trunks however, took her hand and led
her into his house.  He was smiling and calling for his mother.  He ran into the
living room and found a neighbor of his leaning over his mother, Bulma, who was
lying in her bed.  The neighbor turned to Trunks and smiled, but sadly, and said,
" I'm so sorry Trunks, your mother has caught the plague." Trunks stared, not
believing, and rushed over to his mother's side.  Bulma opened her eyes and
smiled weakly. 
       " There you are Trunks! I was wondering what was taking you so long!" 
She ended up coughing and closed her eyes again.  Trunks's eyes filled with
tears, and as he turned to Sasami, she had an idea.  
       " Trunks, why don't you stay here with your mother? I can go and give the
antidote to the hospitals."  He smiled at her, stood, and kissed her.  
       " Thank you" was all he said.  Then he sat on the floor by his mother's side
to take care of her.
                   ***********************************************************************
       Sasami ran as fast as she could, trying to remember Trunks' directions to
the nearest hospital.  At last she found it, and luckily the nurses didn't stare at
her too hard and didn't give her a hard time when she explained about the
antidote.  She followed them down hallways after they had made the antidote. 
Every room that they had was filled with people sick and dying from the plague. 
Carefully stepping over bodies, Sasami helped to give them the antidote.  After
five or six hours of this she began to feel dizzy, but there were too few people
already to help.  So wearily she kept answering the painful cries of the people.
       Meanwhile, Trunks was busy helping his mother.  Before Sasami had left
he had given her the antidote and was now only waiting for her to wake up.  His
thoughts drifted to Sasami, and he day dreamed of their future together,
because he loved her so much that he knew in time they would get married.  A
smile came to  his face, just thinking of her, and he worriedly wondered what
was keeping her so long.  He hoped she wasn't lost, but the hospital wasn't too
far from his house, and if she wasn't back in an hour, he would go look for her...
       One of the nurses was looking at Sasami as she stumbled around, giving
people the antidote, and at last she told Sasami she should go lie down. 
Gratefully, she did so, and fell into a deep sleep...
       Trunks woke up, hearing people enter his house, going to the door, he
stopped suddenly.  His neighbor  was standing next to a man who was  holding
Sasami.  A very ill looking Sasami.  Trunks rushed forward and took her in his
arms.
       " What happened to her?" He demanded.  His neighbor wrung her hands as
she said, " Oh Trunks! She has the plague! We gave her the antidote, but she's
not waking up!"  Trunks ran into the living room and set her on the floor gently. 
He looked up in surprise to see Bulma leaning over him.  
       " And who is this Trunks?  I leave you alone for a few days and you come
back with a strange girl, honestly! What am I going to do with you?"  Quickly
Trunks explained, trying to keep his voice from shaking, especially when Bulma
finally shook her head and sighed.
       " I'm sorry Trunks.  I don't know.  If what you're telling me is true and
Sasami is an alien, then, I don't know...the antidote could have strange effects
on her.  We'll just have to wait and see."  Trunks stared at her, not believing his
ears.  He sat beside her, saying nothing, not crying, but not doing anything
either.  He only sat and hoped, begged, that Sasami would be ok.  After hours
went by, nothing had changed. Trunks sat there the entire night, but she didn't
even move.  Finally, in the morning, Bulma told him that if nothing happened
within the next few hours, nothing ever would.  
       Still in a state of shock, Trunks held Sasami in his arms.  After half an
hour, 30 mintes that felt like years, Sasami's eyes opened.  Trunks grinned and
hugged her to him.  Only to hear a baffled, frightened voice ask, " Who are
you?!"  
       " I'm Trunks, Sasami, remember?" He asked her desperately.  Her blank
eyes told him everything though.  She had lost her memory, or most of it.  She
remembered everything except Trunks,and other events that had happened
recently.  Tears did come this time.  He hid them from Sasami though, she
wouldn't know or understand.  It was hard enough.  Bulma tried to comfort him,
but nothing she said helped.  The only thing he could think of to do was and try
to take her back to Tenchi.  Which he did, the next day.  Thankfully, Washu
hadn't fixed the rip in the dimensions and he was able to find his way back.
       The only person at the house when he got back was Anya.  She ran out,
looking surprised.
       " What's going on Trunks?  Are you ok Sasami?"  Trunks explained, since
Sasami still had a dazed look on her face. Anya's eyes filled with tears when he
told her, but she thanked him for bringing her back.  
       " Are you ever going to come back Trunks?" He just smiled at her and went
back in his time machine.
             ******************************************************************
       It was two weeks after Sasami had come back.  She was sitting beside her
pond again.  Another beautiful day...Sasami looked up into the sky.  Neither
Tenchi or Anya had answered her questions, not really.  She sighed.  All that
she could recall was a vague memory of being competely happy, or looking
forward to something, and another even more vague memory of a boy.  A boy
whose name she couldn't quite remember...She was sure she would remember
it someday, sometimes she had dreams, dreams that were almost memories...
       Quietly she walked back to the house.  The first thing she noticed was that
both Tenchi and Anya were pale and Tenchi was holding a sheet of paper.
       " What is it?" Sasami asked.  Tenchi answered her, his voice shaking,
       " It's a letter, a letter from Ryoko."
