	"All I saw was you!" Asuka's tears flooded the 
sand.
	"I...Asuka," Shinji grasped his chest, somehow 
preventing himself from crying again, "What?"
	It wasn't enough he'd seen everyone turned to LCL 
beforehand. Even the possibility of her being the only 
other female, no human made him mad. But seeing her 
break down, it made him sick.
	There was no answer, only a slight tremor as Asuka 
peered into the sky, filled with the image of some 
spiky-haired woman. 
	"It's the truth, Tenchi," Washuu's nasal voice 
filled the echoing basement, "I swear! I, the greatest 
scientist in the universe, looked into one of my worlds 
and there they were!"
	Tenchi looked at the monitor, displaying the 
conversation between Asuka and Shinji. They didn't look 
like the creatures Washuu would make, recalling a 
malfunctioned robot twin Washuu once made for herself. They 
seemed like they came from someplace else.
	Tenchi stared at the monitor in disbelief. They 
were interacting with each other, in some sort of talk 
about "Evangelions" and "piloting".
	"And...you're going to examine them close-up?" he 
swallowed.
	Washuu was the scientist who was born to study 
everything of everyone that came to her attention. A 
while back, Washuu tried taking a blood sample of him. 
Tenchi knew Washuu conducted experiments on those she 
studied, meaning there was a slim chance those 
"specimens" on the monitor would survive.
	"Relax, no dissections, but this gives me an 
opportunity to study them!"
	"No!" but it wasn't from Tenchi.
	A green-haired woman stepped into the laboratory. 
What appeared to be a staff was firmly gripped by the 
woman, who looked neither frightened, nor clueless of 
Washuu. 
	"Setsuna," Washuu held no confidence in her voice, 
"You really shouldn't intrude like this."
	"Oh, but I should," Setsuna pointed her staff at 
Washuu, letting its glow increase each second.
	An image formed. A blonde with what appeared to be 
"meatball-like hair" formed within Washuu's mind. She 
seemed to be pleading to some masked man in a Tuxedo 
suit, though what she was saying was still unclear to 
Washuu.

******************************************************

	"Mamoru." Serena whispered to the sky.
	Only a few weeks ago, she remembered everything. 
She was once a SailorScout. Mamoru was once Tuxedo 
Mask, the love who constantly worked to save her from 
perilous situations, only he was brainwashed, working 
for the malevolent Queen Beryl. As she stared at the 
memories in her mind, Serena wished them to go away.
	She was in another world, annexed for the sake of 
the guizhinshou, since she was Princess Serenity. She 
remembered the green-haired "guardian of time" that 
told of worse things to come. Serena still couldn't 
understand how her use of some "guizhinshou" would wipe 
out the other SailorScouts, and especially, her Mamoru. 
It was only from looking into the woman's despaired 
eyes that she knew she had to leave the world she was 
in, to prevent whatever tragedies ahead in time.
	A cold wind brushed against her as she heard the 
crackling of numerous leaves, "Serena, aren't you 
coming in?"
	Turning around, she only confirmed the voice she 
guessed would speak to her. Touji was the type who'd 
care the most at the crucial times, but he was never a 
Sailor Scout, so he had no idea how to help.
	"Touji, it's cold," Serena continued quickly, "I 
mean, for you. Shouldn't you head inside?"
	If he'd been hurt, he didn't let it show, "You must 
come inside. C'mon, love, Akane's worried about you."
	Serena noted Akane for a brief moment. She was 
twice her age, only slightly younger than her own mom, 
but Akane still wore the youthful face that kept her 
content. She was a doting motherly figure, but she 
still wasn't a real mother.
	Shaking the thought away, Serena let Touji lead her 
back to their home. She knew her life with the 
SailorScouts had to be forgotten again, if she was ever 
to go on in life.
	
	"What's with Serena?" Ranma scarfed down the last 
of his chicken before continuing, "she seems kinda down 
today..."
	"Just like last week, last month," Nabiki cut in, 
"Even Touji's baffled."
	"You don't think her memory's returning," Ranma 
stated the obvious.
	"Of course, she had another life in Setsuna's 
world," Kasumi lifted Ranma's empty dishes from the 
table, "Once she's remembered fully, it'll be hard for 
her to forget."
	"Poor Serena, poor Touji," Akane looked out the 
window, "and he has no idea."
(Flashback to two years before)
	"Please, take care of Serena," Setsuna looked down 
to the unconscious fourteen-year-old, "She left her 
world to save her friends. Please, let her reside 
here."
	Akane and Ranma were the joint owners of the Tendo-
Saotome School of Anything Goes Martial Arts. It'd been 
fifteen years since their marriage and ten years since 
they realized Ranma couldn't give Akane a child. As 
they looked in sympathy upon the weary young girl 
before them, they both realized their chance for a 
child, someone to raise as their own. 
	Taking a hold of one of Akane's hands, Ranma 
nodded, "We'll do our best."
	"Setsuna's weak smile managed to light up the room, 
"She will not remember for a time, not of her past, nor 
of being Princess Serenity, but once she does, I'll 
return."

*************

	In Setsuna's world, it was only a few days after 
Serena was rendered unconscious by Setsuna and sent to 
the world where Ranma was. When Setsuna sent SailorMoon 
away from the world, Setsuna brought in an unconscious 
woman in Serena's place. Also suffering a form of 
forgetfulness, the woman who took Serena's place only 
remembered fragments of which she once was.
	"I never wanted to be SailorMars2!" Jesse gripped 
her transformation pen, yelling "Mars Power!" turning 
back to Raye, "I hate this!"
	Jesse was in her own version of the SailorMars 
suit, with the one difference of her bow, which had an 
odd cat pendant on top. It might've looked like a 
meowth, but in the usually perilous state, Jesse never 
took notice.
	"Can't you keep your mouth shut? You think I ever 
wanted a copycat 'scout' to mess up our operations?" 
Mars glared back at Jesse.
	"Mess up? What do you think you can do with that 
puny lighter attack? I swear, a Growlithe would've 
roasted any of your measly..."
	Grabbing her by the back, SAilorJupiter lifted her 
a foot off the ground, in an irate state, "Just shutup 
and help us kill those youma."
	With no reason formed in her mind to protest, 
considering Makoto's evident strength and bad mood, 
Jesse gasped "okay," and was gruffly set back to the 
ground.
	Somehow, the youma watching those proceedings was 
absorbed into doing nothing. The two merely absorbed 
what was in front of them. Those were the sailor scouts 
that brought out the guizhinshou and the doom of the 
infamous Negaverse?
	Minako's boot tapped the ground as she silently 
waited for the other scouts to settle. Just a few feet 
away were some killer, spiky-haired monster, and her 
purple-haired companion. Eyeing the cyan-haired youma, 
Minako wondered why she hadn't attacked already.
	"They're worse than you and I, Lady Ryoko," Ayeka 
looked at the two SailorMars.
	"Yep. So all these universes got affected," Ryoko 
sighed, eyeing the Scouts warily, "I don't think 
Setsuna told them of us." 
	Ayeka said nothing, for the scouts finally 
assembled, chanting their slogans of "love and 
justice," as Washuu predicted. The scouts soon grew 
weary of waiting for Ayeka and Ryoko to respond.
	"Mars Fire..." Raye and Jesse both chanted, 
"Ignite!"
	As the flame around where Ryoko was positioned 
before dissipated, the scouts realized the youma was 
nowhere to be found.
	Ayeka merely sighed as she waited for Ryoko to 
materialize. Even if she was in the area of the attack, 
Ayeka was unaffected.
	"Whaaa?" SailorMars2 turned to SailorMercury; "It 
didn't even phase them!"
	Mercury turned her visor on, then breathed; 
"They're not from the Negaverse."
	"Then what are they?" Minako stared at the two 
"youma" grimly.
	"Perhaps you should let us explain," Ayeka turned 
to SailorVenus, "Minako."
 
	(Somewhere in Tokyo)
	"I sense danger." Brock grinned as he gripped his 
rose, "Time to save the day," Brock turned left and 
right, repeating less dramatically, "I said, time to 
save the day!"
	"Do I really have to wear this?" another male in a 
tuxedo appeared from a shadow with what looked like a 
yellow rodent on his shoulder.
	"Pika, Pika," the rodent sighed as it adjusted it's 
mask.

*************************

Characters- (So far)
	Shinji- Ok, I honestly read the scripts of all the 
Evangelion eps & endmovie, but I didn't watch all them, 
nor the movie. Still, I know how Shinji was a 14-year 
old who usually cried and was down throughout the 
series. Still, he was the pilot of Eva 01 and at the 
end of evangelion, where everyone turned 2 LCL. After 
talking to Rei (a former Eva00 pilot/who was the one 
who turned all the other humans into some liquid called 
lcl), he landed on the shore of some island, only to 
see Asuka, the girl who always competed with him to be 
a better Eva pilot.
	Asuka- Aggressive, she mostly picked on Shinji 
throughout the series, but when he strangled her after 
ending up on the island, she embraced him. From the 
script, she said something like "I feel sick". This 
story is somewhere after that point (hopefully I didn't 
spoil the end of evangelion 4 those who didn't see it.)
	Washuu-Yep, the short, spiky, red-haired scientists 
with that slightly- annoying voice from TenchiMuyo. 
Since she's so smart, she created some artificial 
worlds in the show (episodes 11-13). In this, Tenchi is 
surprised she created real, live humans (or he just 
thinks she did). 
	Tenchi- Before meeting Ryoko and others in the 
show, Tenchi lived a quiet, sorta dull life. Shy and 
dull at first, Tenchi ended up killing the infamous 
Kagato, so he should be given some credit.
	Touji- He was a character on Evangelion, a pilot of 
Eva03, but he never wanted to pilot it. Kinder and more 
open than most of the other characters of Eva, he's 
ended up with Serena (a.k.a. SailorMoon) here.
	SailorMoon (or Serena)- She's with Touji, but her 
memory and timeframe is sometime after Mamoru was 
brainwashed and turned to Queen Beryl's side. She was 
sent to the world of Ranma1/2, where she's been living 
for around 2 years, only, she just began remembering 
who she once was a few weeks ago.
	Ranma and Akane- In Ranma 1/2, Ranma was the guy 
who fell into a spring, turning into a girl whenever 
splashed with cold water, and turned back to his 
masculine state. Ranma was set up with Akane to marry. 
In this story, Ranma and Akane are considerably older 
than in the show. Touji isn't their son, but the end of 
this series should cover everything.
	Nabiki-the breadwinner in Akane's family in the 
series, she was the one brainstorming scheme to make 
money off of others.
	Kasumi-The motherly-figure in Akane's family, she 
took the role of thehouse caretaker after their mother 
died.
	Ryoko-spiky, cyan-haired, creation of Washuu's? 
Well, she pretty much rivaled with Ayeka in the series 
4 Tenchi.
	Ayeka-"Crown Princess of Jurai", she's related to 
Tenchi, but in the series she first thought he was 
human, and rivaled Ryoko 4 him.
	Jesse - SailorMars2 in this? Before I'm flamed 4 
this, umm, well, she's as grouchy in Pokemon as 
SailorMars is in Sailormoon. A Team Rocket Member in 
the show, she was a badguy, so why not make her a 
SailorScout for irony's sake?
	SailorMars-Raye Hino seems grouchy, though she cares for 
those in her group, so what's to say?
	SailorJupiter-Usually with a pleasant disposition, 
Makoto cares for her group, though when really angry, 
she's dangerous to her enemies.
	SailorMercury-The smart one in the group, her blue 
visor scans areas and creatures. She's mostly the 
extremely nice one.
	SailorVenus- Minako was the ditsy one of the sailor 
scouts, like SailorMoon in the show, but she's nice. 
She probably would've been the leader in Moon's 
absence, since she was a sailor scout before the main 
SailorMoon series began.
	Brock- Falling in love with almost every girl, 
Brock's the perfect character to take on the role 
of....someone in SailorMOon.
	The other Masked figure and the rodent-hmm...
