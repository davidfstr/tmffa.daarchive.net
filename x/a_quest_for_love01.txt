Chapter 1
Mysteries

        As Peter walked towards the mess hall to meet his
sister Sarah for their daily lunching he thought back
to the guard duty he had just gotten off from. He had
come across a strange gravitational force that had
pulled at his Varitech, he had to use all his skill to
control it. ' What the hell was that thing? It nearly
got me.' Peter was a Lieutanant in the U.N spacy and
his sister was the chief science officer. She was his
superior, but he never listen, she didn't really mind
seeing that he was almost 4 years older than she was.
" What's on your mind Pete?" She asked as he walked up
and took his seat across from her.
"Humm...nothing big. Just some wierd gravitational
field almost ended it all for me." I replied.
"Really..?" She said taking a bite out of her chicken
burger, not amused.
"NO, not really" I yelled. Everyone now was loking
over at them." Do you mind I would like to have a
moment with my sister."
"Hey, I was just being concerned," She said gagging.
He had scared her so much she started to choke on her
lunch.
"I know I was just kidding, let's eat." I replied.
        Over the loud speaker came an order for me and Sarah
to report to the Bridge." Dr. Squall and Lieutanat
Squall please report to the Bridge."
"Yeah we'll be their later," I yalled at the loud
speaker.
        Another voice came over the speaker, it was the
Captain." Move your asses NOW!"
I turned to my sister and spoke my famous
words,"Nothing good can come from this"
Sarah retorts " They know us too well!"
"I would say so. We better go or he'll have our
asses."
        With that we got up and made our way to the bridge.
When we arrived I noticed the Captain reading my
report about the gravitational field.
"Lieutanat Squall, is this report true?" The Captain
asked wide eyed.
"Yes it is sir," I replied.
"Then we have a problem.....I can't move the Macross
without being sure there isn't a risk from the
gravitational field. Therefor since you know where it
is and are one of our best piolets and since your
sister is Chief Scientist, I thought you two could
ride their together and study it before we move."
"Sir," I said in shock.
"That's an order. Equipe your Veritech with it's super
modifications and go when you are ready."
"Sir," we said in unison.
"That is all, now go."
"Yes sir."
        With a salute we both went our seperate ways to get
ready. I went to the hanger to get the Veritech ready
and she went to do what she does.
*******************************
'This is bull shit, I'm a scientist not a miracle
worker. Whoa, I've got to stop watching movies,
They're starting to become part of everyday
vocabulary. Humm....what do I need? One of these and
one of these, this do-hickey and that one. God I don't
want to go...this was my day off! I bet Pete is loving
this. Every chance he can get he'll fly that damn
thing. Augh! Alright I'm ready...god i'm hungry, can't
a girl finish her meal anymore?'
"Dr. Squall?" Someone shouted behind me.
" What? I'm in a hurry here," I turned around to see
Lieutanat Hood standing behind me with roses in his
arms.
"Um, Sarah, Where are you going? We had a date
tonight. Remember?" He asked.
"Oh shit! I forgot. Sorry, I was just called into
duty. Peter and I have to check some gravitational
field out that he found lastnight. If you want someone
to blame, blame Pete! I really wanted to go too! Note
to self, kick pete in the shin for finding that stupid
thing!
" It's ok Sarah, maybe the next time we both have the
same night off....which willnever happen. We never
have the same nights off," He complained.
"I'll just put in for some vacation time, don't worry
Scott. I've gotta go, you know how impatient Peter is.
Bye!" I yelled over my shoulder.
**********************************
        I arrived at the hanger and began to prepare a two
person version of my veritech with the super
modifications." I really hate when I have to fly her.
All she does is bitch <mimicking>'Your going to fast,
don't turn so fast'. It's enough to drive a saine man
nuts." The crew laughed at this, they knew Sarah, she
was a kind person, but could turn into a bitch in a
heart beat.
"L.T. how many extra clips for your main gun do you
want?"
        I was about to say just one, but what a cold hand
landed on my shoulder and sent shivers down my back."
AAAA....give me a full load and a few extras I want to
be safe than sorry," I said with a little fear in my
voice.
"Sir a full battle load?" He asked in shock.
"Ya, just do it private,"  I yelled as I walked away.
        I went to my locker and got my weapons out of
storage. For some reason I couldn't shack this feeling
that something was going to happen....something bad
and I have to be ready. As I turned to my plane I
noticed Sarah standing next to it waiting, I dragged
my bag behind me. Sarah looked at me in surprise I
just muttered incoherently and stuffed my bag into the
sub-bay." Are you ready for this, let's go and get
this over with." I asked already climbing in to the
cockpit.
"I guess so," Sarah replied.
"Well then let's go," I said in my normal smart ass.
        While I making final launch preperations Sarah asked
"Is everything alright?"
"I have this bad feeling about the gravitational
field," I relied finishing my check list and a sudden
silence filled the plane. " Anyways we'll worry about
that when we get back," with that said I swallowed and
hoped I wouldn't have to eat my own words. The ship
was moving into launch position.
"I don't think I will ever get used to sitting upside
down like this," Sarah said grimmising.
"Hahahahahahahaha....extend launch arm," I managed to
say over my own laughing.
"Roger Sir, good hunting," said the launch officer.
        With that there was a quick movement outwards and a
loud noise as the clamps let released and we rolled
out into space. With a couple of quick movements the
plane came up straight and blasted off into space. As
we reached the last known corridenents of the
gravitatioal field it grabbed hold of the veritech. I
tried to switch into guardian mode to stop us, but
with the forward volacity and the force of the
gravitatioal field I couldn't handle her.
"We're being sucked in," Sarah screamed.
"No shit, hang on," I yelled back.
***************************
        There was a bright light as we began to get sucked
in, then sound it's self seemed to disappear. I knew I
was screaming out of fear but I couldn't hear myself.
Then if that wasn't scary enough all light seemed to
melt away leaving a deep black, a pur black, a black
that I had never seen before.'I'm passing out this
isn't good' with that thought, out I went. The next
thing I remembered we were falling towards a planet
that looked somewhat familiar, but somehow different."
Ohhhhh shit no response from the engains, we're out of
control!!!!!!" I yelled, shocked at the sound of
hearing my own voice again.
        Trying as a hard as I could I just couldn't get the
engains to restart, we kept falling. I did have
control to spoilers and flaps so I could move the
plane. I brought the nose up for a standard reentery
and kept playing with the engains restart program
'hopefully the eternal heat are working or it could be
a hot ride to the surface.'
"Hang on Sarah we're going in hard...Sarah? Sarah! Oh
shit this ain't good" as we continued our
uncontrollable drop towards the surface I thought that
was the end of us when suddenly the engains powered
back up with s sudden thrust forward," Shit too much
power! We're going to bounce of the atmosphere,
hopefully this thing can still transform," I pulled
back on the transformation switch marked G. The
veritech made a horrible noise and began to shake
violently," Damn! It's broke. Now the only thing left
to do is crash land and hope for the best!"
        I flipped the to the heat shield that the covered the
cockpit, sealed the fluid lines,and shielded the amo
stores. I lowered my visor in case of the worst I
didn't want to see the front counsil impale me nor did
I want to see my flesh being burned off if the heat
shields failed to work. My mind began to wander, what
might have happened, would he get married,would he
have any children, would the war ever end, why was his
sister chosen, she still had so much life left to live
and didn't need to die like this, not here not now.
The most important thing that went through his mind
was would he havebeen truly happy?
