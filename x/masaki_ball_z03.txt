Hi there! I'm sorry I left you hangin' there last time, and that this one took 
so long (!). (you know- the holidays and all...) This one's gonna be 
interesting. I promise- well at least it won't be as bad as doing the laundry or 
something. But hey! I want to warn you though- I was listening to some pretty 
heavy semi-Satanic Goth music (via my crazy Goth Cousin, who shall remain 
nameless, but you know who you are!) while I wrote this, so it might be a little 
weird. This one is also very definitely of a dark nature!!! Tee hee... Of 
course, now, I'm just babbling.
I'll shut up and let you read...

Masaki Ball Z!
Part Three: No Need for a Possession Session


The small vessel slowly pulled itself free from its artificial tear, the blazing 
light surrounding it gently fading away. The craft seemed to be a perfect black 
sphere, but as Trunks and Gohan flew closer, they noticed small pockmarks 
marring its surface. Dread and fear seemed to leak from the ship in rivulets. 
Not allowing the negative emotions to over come his higher functions, Trunks 
shot several ki blasts at the ship, the attack bouncing right back at him. Gohan 
tried a small Kame-Hame-Ha, only to be knocked backwards onto the forest floor.
"This thing has some kind of shield, we need to find a way past it. If we keep 
firing, all we'll end up doing is killing ourselves." Trunks said as he helped 
Gohan to his feet.
"Right!" Gohan nodded, "Let's see what the others think." 
Regrouping with the others, Gohan and Trunks explained the situation.
"Hmmm... so, we can't attack it straight on, and if we get close to it, it 
starts emitting negative emotions at us! Well! This is hopeless! Just the job 
for the universe's greatest scientific mind!" cried Washu as she shook her 
dainty finger in the air with determination.
"That thing... it's evil. I felt its hate everywhere." Trunks was breathing 
heavily and a nervous sweat bubbled up across his brow, "Washu, we have to find 
a way to destroy it..."
"You okay?" Ryoko tried to make her concern seem like just teasing, but she was 
scared.
"Yeah, yeah... it's just... that hate is so... wrong..." Trunks's face lit with 
anger. He had seen what such evil could do to a world. His world. Yet this 
evil... felt so familiar...
"We need to study it, maybe we could duplicate its technology to get you boys 
and Bulma home," Washu stared at the orb, "if we could disable it, and get it to 
my lab..."
"No! We can't let it leave here ever! Even the chance that it could escape..." 
Gohan was as adamant as Trunks, his eyes shining with anger, "I won't put your 
world in danger just to get to mine. I can't let anyone else down."
"Washu, this feeling I have, that thing is wrong... it feels evil and old... 
Like Kagato...We should just destroy..." Ryoko was cut off as the craft began to 
spin; it made a pulsating whirr sound as it gradually built up speed.
As the frailer members of the group (namely Bulma) ran for cover behind the 
trees, the rest powered up. Trunks turned Super Saiyan, his purple locks jumping 
up and glowing yellow. Gohan screamed and let his ki explode in a massive power 
up. Tenchi and Aeka used their Juraian powers to transform into battle suits. 
Katsuhito even joined in, standing erect behind his bodkin... But Ryoko, she 
stood motionless.
Staring at the orb, she felt herself lose control. The single gem on her wrist 
glowed faintly as the orb's occupant took over her body. With eyes burning red, 
Ryoko turned towards Tenchi. She raised her arm, forming a small ball of energy 
within her palm...

He smirked. It was so simple. He laughed quietly, child-like; her body would 
serve him now...  The red pulse in his eyes beat faster, to the rhythm of his 
once-human heart. 
"So many places, now I'm almost done..."
His hand raised, and he urged Ryoko to fire...

"Tenchi," only a whisper escaped Ryoko's lips, but it was enough for Trunks's 
Saiyan ears.
"Nooo! Ryoko!" Trunks jetted towards her sinister form, catching the blast meant 
for Tenchi with his ki shield.
The blast hardly touched him, she had used as little power as the evil creature 
would allow. 
Trunks grabbed her, "Why Ryoko, why did you?" he searched her eyes, her glowing 
empty eyes. 
"Get away from her, Trunks, she's been possessed by whatever's in that thing!" 
screamed Tenchi.
Ryoko threw off Trunks's hands and jumped away from him. Pushing another ball of 
energy into a sword, Ryoko lunged at the Saiyan and slashed downward.
Trunks was too fast for her. He jumped to her left dodging the beam and hitting 
her hard in the stomach. She recovered quickly and swung at his head wildly, her 
face a mask.

The boy was growing impatient, "Just what I don't need... Saiyans."
Pushing Ryoko to her limits, he still couldn't touch Trunks's golden figure. The 
child screamed, his plan seemingly shattered.

Ryoko swung harder and faster at Trunks, her arms almost wrenching themselves 
out of their sockets. Trunks held back as much as possible, afraid he would kill 
Ryoko. Ryoko formed ball after ball of energy, throwing them haphazardly at 
Trunks, who easily dodged each one.
"Ryoko, fight back! Don't let whatever it is win!" screamed Trunks as he threw 
her backwards with a very slight ki blast.
"She can't! We have to get to whoever's doing this to her! Just try to hold her 
back while we check out the ship." Washu yelled as she moved towards the craft 
slowly.   

'Oh, what's going on? Why is Trunks fighting Ryoko? It's that thing!' Bulma 
thought, peering out from her hiding place within the brush. All the others were 
out there with Trunks. She felt like a coward, but what could she do? She had no 
special powers or fighting abilities.
'Well, I am smart, though, so maybe I can get to that ship while they're 
distracted with Ryoko. I'll figure it out in no time!'
"Way to go Bulma!" Bulma said loudly, immediately putting her hands over her 
mouth, "Oops! Guess I shouldn't be so loud, I have to be stealthy to do this 
right." 
Moving slowly towards the black sphere, Bulma kept as much brush as she could 
between herself and the pulsating ship. Her mind was so full of nonsense and 
scientific theorems that she hardly even noticed the fear sent off by the black 
ship.
Feeling pretty proud of her 'guerilla tactics', she slowly moved beneath the orb 
on her hands and knees.
'Hmmm, that's funny; it looked bigger over there than it does up close. It's 
only about the size of a Saiyan space pod. There can't be but one guy in 
there...'
Lying under the ship like a car repairman, Bulma began to inspect its surface. 
'There's a panel here; it looks like it wants a palm to activate something. And 
I could swear those patterns meant something... Gosh, I hope Little Trunks is 
okay with Sasami. She'll make a good mommy someday. Oh, what was I just 
thinking? Oh, yeah! Alien space pod stuff, right. Okay. Let's see. If this is 
pattern does mean something, what could it mean? Like 'don't push this or you 
fry'? Well, only one way to find out.'
Bulma reached her hand towards the small black panel; hesitantly, she pressed 
it.

Ryoko swung at Trunks, her plasma sword colliding with his ki shield. She 
pushed, her energy rising with every inch she gained. As she was about to break 
through, her glowing eyes pulsed, she stepped back, confusion all over her face. 
Trunks gained the upper hand; bringing down his arm, he aimed for her heart.
"No! Stop, Trunks!" Ryoko cried as her eyes returned to their brassy yellow and 
the evil let go of her body. She held her hands out in front of her, trying to 
block his fist. Trunks moved too fast, expecting to meet with greater 
resistance. His fist seemed to bury itself in Ryoko's chest, her eyes bugged and 
she gurgled.

'There's someone here with me- I feel them. Where... Where!' the small child 
shook with rage as his concentration upon Ryoko was shattered. 'You've made a 
big mistake, whoever you are, I'll kill you... painfully...'

Bulma felt her body change, it felt as though she were being torn apart, and 
then put back together on a molecular level. She felt a floor beneath her feet, 
and when her darkened vision returned what she saw made her gasp.
'I can't be in the ship, am I dead? This isn't- no it is possible. It could be 
like Washu's lab, or a capsule. I can't tell which, but it must be sophisticated 
technology... Well whoever invented this was pretty stupid, though, putting a 
panel like that on the bottom of their ship. I'd at least put something like 
that on the top where people like me can't reach.'
Bulma stood in what appeared to be a cavernous storage bay. Crates upon crates 
of who knows what stretched to the ceiling, which she could hardly make out. 
'This place is huge! Wait till I tell the guys about this! That is if I ever get 
home...'
Bulma decided that just standing in the middle of this very large place was 
getting her nowhere, so she went off to explore.

"Oh, God! Ryoko!" Trunks held the limp form in his arms, seeming close to sobs. 
Washu ran to the two warriors, her face a mask.
"We have to get her to my lab. Her regeneration ability should have already 
healed that... It must be whatever's in that ship!" Washu yelled at Trunks.
He didn't respond, his eyes seemed empty. 
"We have to get her out of here!" screamed Washu as she shook Trunks. 
Trunks blinked, refocused his eyes, and scooped up Ryoko and Washu. Flinging 
himself into the sky, Trunks made himself wall up all the emotions he was 
having. All that he felt was a dull ache, a numbness. 
Washu cringed, her arms pinned tightly to her sides. She felt divided- wanting 
to help her daughter Ryoko, and needing to save her friends. "What about the 
ship? What's going on... This is so wrong... I have to save them... My little 
girl..."

 Tenchi stood with Aeka, Gohan, and Katsuhito discussing options. 
"We can't just go up to it and ask to be let in, and I don't see a door, 
anyway."
"Yes Lord Tenchi, I see your point, but we have to do something soon. That thing 
will not wait forever, and if we let it go, who knows what could happen." Aeka 
would not admit it, but she was still getting over the upset of possibly losing 
Ryoko. She was her rival, but she was also a friend.
"I say we see what happens. Good things come to those who wait," Katsuhito 
always had something smart to say.
"You guys, one of my friends almost got killed by another one of my friends and 
all because of that thing! I'm not waiting around to see what it does next. I 
say we destroy it." Gohan had never felt so cold and angry before. He hadn't 
known Ryoko that well, but it still made him mad to see something toying with 
her like that.
"It seems we are all in disagreement, I suggest we..." Katsuhito was cut off by 
Tenchi.
"Wait! Where's Bulma?" cried Tenchi.
"I thought Miss Bulma went behind those bushes over there..." Aeka looked, but 
couldn't see her.
"Let me try to sense her ki." Gohan concentrated on Bulma's life force, and 
looked up; he was puzzled, "She's not here, but she... it's like when we got 
here and she was in Washu's lab. We could sense her, but it was scrambled so 
badly... it's like that."
"Could she be... in there?" Aeka pointed dramatically at the black ship 
pulsating in the distance.

Bulma had been walking down the same corridor for a while, not seeing anyone or 
anything. There were no doors, and it almost seemed she was walking in circles. 
'Oh, this is so boring! I hope I don't DIE of BOREDOM!' Bulma wanted to scream, 
but knew she was being sought by whatever was on this ship.
The tunnel turned sharply, startling Bulma.
"Hmmmm... This is different..."
As Bulma turned down the corridor, she noticed the walls where unevenly colored, 
and did not seem quite flush with each other.
Bulma reached out to one of the more prominent wall panels, finding that her 
hand went right through the white metal, its surface rippling like water beneath 
her palm. 
'That's funny, how can this be happening?' Bulma pondered the wall for a couple 
of minutes, 'Maybe the atoms move... or maybe the wall is an illusion... or 
maybe...'
Deciding that theorem could wait, Bulma took a deep breath, and stepped fully 
through the wall.


Trunks stood beside the pod Ryoko occupied, her naked body immersed in green 
goo. Washu had done everything she could for Ryoko, now they could only wait and 
hope. 
"Another person dead because of me..." Trunks looked down at his feet, his eyes 
watering slightly. He blinked away the emotion and continued, "I know we just 
met and I don't know if I'd be saying any of this if you could hear me, but I'm 
glad I've gotten to know you."
Trunks crossed his arms, a frown plastered all over his face, 'I have to go back 
to the others soon... I'm... so sorry... Ryoko. I hope you can forgive me... 
when you wake up..."
Trunks walked silently away from the large cylindrical tank, hands in his 
pockets. The moment he was past the Masaki's front door, he jetted up into the 
early afternoon sky. The sun had been covered in thick black clouds, to match 
his mood.

Sasami stared after the purple-haired Saiyan. She sighed, her mind reeling 
slightly as she felt her nightmare mesh with reality. 
"Oh, Tsunami... what can we do?"
Little Trunks began to wail, begging for someone to feed him. Sasami scurried to 
the living room, where the crib Washu had engineered stood.
As Sasami saw to little Trunks, her mind cried out in silent pain, "I need to do 
something... please... Tsunami..."
