    One afternoon, in Tokyo, a little boy lay sick in his bed playing a
video
game.  His mother entered the room.  She laid her hand on his forehead to
determine whether he had a temperature.
    "Your grandfather is here to see you," she said.
    "Can't you tell him I'm sick?" the little boy whined.
    "He came all the way out here to see you because you are sick," the
mother told him.
    "He'll pinch my cheek, I hate that," the boy protested.
    "Maybe he won't this time."
    At that moment, the grandfather burst in.  "Hey!  How's my sick
grandson?" he asked as he crossed the room to the boy's bed.  "I brought you
a present."
    "What is it?" the boy asked, becoming interested.  The grandfather
handed
him a small rectangular object wrapped in paper.  The boy tore the wrapping
paper off.  He looked up at his grandfather in disappointment.
    "It's a book," he complained.
    "It's not a book!" the grandfather informed him.  "It's manga.  When I
was your age, television was called 'manga'.  This is the manga that my
father used to read to me, and his father used to read it to him.  And now
I'm going to read it to you."
    "Has it got any sports in it?" the boy asked doubtfully.
    "Are you kidding?" the grandfather said grinning ear to ear.  "Fencing,
fighting, torture, true love, escape, mad scientists, homosexualityâ€¦"
    "I'll try to stay awake," the grandson sighed caustically, leaning back
against his pillows.
    "Oh well thank you very much," the grandfather replied.  He opened the
manga to the first page,  "No Need For A Princess Bride.  Chapter one."
