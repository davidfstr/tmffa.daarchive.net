Introduction to Scattered

	Scattered takes place right after Starting Over, that deals with 
DBZ gang, Tenchi and company, the Sailor Scouts, and of Ranma and Akane 
as they crash land on four different planets in four seperate parts of 
the Galaxy.
	This brings in four more Anime or Video Game worlds, that the 
different groups will be sudjected too. I'm even listing the places and 
who will land on them.

	Hei-fong (Outlaw Star): Ranma, Akane, Tenchi, Ryoko, and Videl
	Guardia Circa (Chrono Trigger/Chrono Cross): Goku, Brad, Lita,
Amy, and Trunks
	Eden (Final Fantasy VII): Vegeta, Krillin, Mina, Serena, and Gohan
	Lodoss (Record of the Lodoss War): Piccolo, Raye, Mayuka,
Eighteen, and Goten

	While the groups are trying to find ways to get back home, 
magically or otherwise. Washu, Tsunami, and the remaining members of the 
heroes families have abandon Earth and are heading for the only safe 
haven available to them, planet Jurai. This starts an really kick ass 
space war drama and a perfect contrast for a second chapter in this 
multi-crossover trilogy that I haven't found a name for yet. I was 
thinking of calling it the Anime Wars Trilogy. But mail is essential and 
suggestions would be appreciated. Scattered will start soon as I get 
mail for Chapter 9 of Starting Over.

Disclaimer: I don't own any of these characters, so don't sue me 
please!!!
