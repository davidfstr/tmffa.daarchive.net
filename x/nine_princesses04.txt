There!  That chapter was a little longer then the other ones!  Happy 
now?  Good!  Okay, I'm gonna combine this chapter with the next one cuz 
they are both really short.  So, the later chapters might be labeled 
wrong.  If it bugs you that much, E-mail me and I'll change them.  I 
don't own Tenchi or Sailor Moon (god I'm tired of saying that, but I 
have to).

	Michiru looked up from her painting.  There was a knock on the 
door.  She answered.  It was Raye.
	"Hey Michiru!  Where is everybody?" Raye asked.
	"Out back.  Why?"  Michiru answered.
	"I've got an announcement," said Raye.  The two girls went 
outside.  The others were sitting on broken lawn chairs talking.
	"Guys?  Listen.  I got the job today.  You know, the priestess 
thing?  But listen, in order to keep the job, I've got to move out," 
Raye said.  The others went nuts.
	"What?"
	"You can't!"
	"I'll miss you too much!"
	"Oh please don't leave Raye!"
	"But listen you guys, I didn't tell you who I'm moving in with.  
Remember that boy we met at school?  Tenchi?  Well, I'm moving in with 
him and his family.  He's invited us all over to help me move in and so 
we can just hang out together," Raye explained.  Haruka, Michiru, and 
Setsuna looked at each other.
	"Raye, I really don't think that's safe.  I mean, Tenchi doesn't 
know you're a Sailor Scout.  What if he found out?  And you said he was 
part of your vision.  He might be trying to hurt you," said Michiru.  
Raye closed her eyes.
	"I don't know.  Something inside me tells me that he's okay.  I 
mean, that I can trust him," Raye said.
	"Is it something inside you, or something outside him?  You 
seemed to think he's pretty cute," said Haruka bitterly.
	"Look, I do not have a crush on Tenchi!  That's just ridiculous!" 
cried Raye.  "If that's what you think, I may as well just move out.  
You're still invited to Tenchi's house tonight, but don't feel 
obligated if you oppose my moving in."  Raye stomped into the house to 
pack.
	"That was pretty harsh Haruka.  I mean, Raye's just trying to 
make things easier for us," said Lita.
	"Well, I can't say I quite trust Tenchi either," said Michiru.
	"I've seen the way he stares at Raye.  I don't like it.  It's 
like he's planning something.  If she's right in his house, he could 
hurt her or worse at any time," said Setsuna.
	"Amy?  What do you think?  You and Tenchi seemed like friends.  
Do you think we should let Raye stay with him?" asked Serena.
	"I really don't see how Tenchi could be dangerous.  But, my 
computer goes crazy whenever I try to scan him.  There's more to him 
than we can see, but I don't think he would hurt Raye," replied Amy.
	"I've got my stuff guys.  I've also called Grandpa and Chad and 
explained that I'm moving out.  If you're coming, we'd better go now if 
we want to get there in time," said Raye, coming out of the house.  
Serena, Amy, Lita, Mina, Rini, and Hotaru stood up.  They weren't going 
to desert Raye.  The girls left.
	"I'll drive you over," offered Setsuna.  "I'll go with them to 
keep an eye on Tenchi," she whispered to Haruka and Michiru.  They both 
nodded.  They realized that if Setsuna wasn't there, they could lose 
Raye forever.

Lady Obsidia looked up from her crystal.  This was too perfect.  It 
seemed the young prince of Jurai, Tenchi, and the Sailor Scouts had 
crossed paths.  It would be so easy to destroy all of them, in one 
swift blow.  Or better yet, get them to turn on each other and bring a 
truly surprise attack.  Why would either Tenchi or the Sailor Scouts' 
leader Sailor Moon bother looking for enemies from space when the 
suspected enemy was right in front of them?
	"Stupid Earth people!  They always seem to become their own 
enemies when they need to band together!" Obsidia laughed hysterically.
	"What are you talking about Obsidia?" asked Kagato.  Lady Obsidia 
explained her plan.  Both of them began to laugh again.

	Luna looked at Artemis.  Diana had decided to go with Rini to 
keep an eye on the Scouts.  All three of the cats had heard the 
argument over Raye's moving in with Tenchi.  There was definitely 
trouble brewing. 
"If the girls are going to fight over Raye and a boy they didn't 
even know, how could we be sure that they wouldn't fall apart when 
they're needed?" asked Luna.
"I don't know.  You and I haven't seen this boy, so we can't be 
sure about him," answered Artemis.
"I guess we'll just have to wait for Diana to come back and tell 
us what she saw," Luna replied.  But neither of the cats were sure 
about anything.  The Sailor Scouts couldn't find any sign of Lady 
Obsidia, her accomplice, or their intended victim.  Instead, they were 
fighting, moving out, and breaking apart.
