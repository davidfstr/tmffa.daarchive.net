"Hey guys & girls, in this fic you'll meet a young sayain named George who
has appears in search of a mysterious power level, Ryory, ( see... Ryory's
Appearance )here's some Stuff you should know. George is the youngest son of

Gohan, and the only son of Gohan and Vegeta's daughter Bra. He is a young
sayain with a short temper and a massive attitude, when added to the ability

to transform to all known Super Sayain levels, there is bound to be some
action and excitement." and just so you guys know this is a spin-off so
anything happening here will not be refered to in the Ryroy saga

Most of the Tenchi characters are copy righted by some people and I'm giving

them the credit for all of 'em. Ryory was created by my friend, and with his

permission to use this character... I present to you. My crossover fic, The
Masakis Discover Sayains... enjoy. ^_\\
______________________________________________________________
*The sceen opens and we find Ryory in the fields of the Masaki Shrine
training, but in the shadows someone is watching*
Ryory: *sighing* If your going to spy on me you might wanna keep your power
down a little more.
George: *landing* So you can sense power levels...
Ryory: *cutting him off* What do you want...Your one of Kagato's men
*starting to power up* well how 'bout you join him
George: Whoa chill I don't... *He is cut off by Ryory's fist connecting with

his jaw* Oh you wanna play, Alright!
*George goes Super Sayain and charges Ryory catching him off gaurd he hits
him sending him into a tree. Ryory, forming an energy sword, charges again
tackling George and pinning him to the ground the sword  going to his
throat*
Ryory: *Through clentched teeth* Tell Kagato he's not gettin me back
George: *Bringing his legs under Ryory and kicking him off* I don't know
what
your talking about.
Ryory: Lies! *he prepares to charge again but George drops to the ground and

begins snoring*
Washu: *comming from out of the bushes* Oh damn he got in the way. *sighing*

Now how am I supposed to test my new super sedative.
Ryory: *rubbing his shoulder* It's ok Mom he's pretty strong but I think we
should get him inside and restrained, he's probably one of Kagato's agents.
*In Washu's lab*
George: *coming to* Oh What hit me? *moving his hand to rub his forehead and

discovering he has been strapped to an examining table* Ha! Leather you
thought this would work *starts jerking the straps to break them and gets
electricuted*
Washu: There specialy designed to hold very strong people, the more you
struggle the more intense the blast.
George: Well then let me go. *setteling back onto the table*
Washu: Not till we get some answers.
Ryory: Yes we want answers.
George: *Testily* To what questions!?
Washu: *unwavering* First off what are you doing here and why did you attack

Ryory.
George: *exasperated* I, didn't attack him, he did that on his own.
Washu: Then what are you doing here?
George: Well about a week ago I was training nearby and I sensed a great
fighting power. I got curious and followed the trail. I wound up here.
Ryory: *Interrupting* A week ago, thats when I first arrived, when we fought

Kagato.
George: *tencely* Anyway, I found him *jerking his head towards Ryory* He
started babbling about a kagato, whatever that is, and next thing I rember I

was here being interrogated by you. Thats the story will you let me out
now?!
Washu: One more question, I examined you while you were out and your DNA
doesn't match any lifeforms in my files, what are you?
George: Short answer, I'm a Sayain, one of the latest generations of a
presumably extinct race.
Washu: How did the Sayains become extinct?
George: *anoyed* Our home planet was destroyed by our employer.
Washu: *raising an eyebrow* Employer?
George: The Sayains were basicaly a race of space pirates who destroyed a
planet's inhabitance and sold the planet, but when we challenged our
superior, Frieza, he got pissed and destroyed the planet. All but four
Sayains died, the ones on assignment.
Washu: And you were on assignment?
George: No That was at least Fifty years ago, My grandfather's were on
assignment. You see my paternal grandfather was sent to Earth on assignment
as an infant, but after sustaining a head injury he forgot his mission and
was raised as a human, an exceptionaly strong one but a human. Then my
maternal grandfather came to earth to persuade my other grandfather to
rejoin
his people.
George: Will you let me go now?
Washu: Fine. *starts typing and the straps release George's wrists and
ankles* But don't go just yet. If you don't mind I'd like to do some tests.
George: *getting up* What kind of tests?
Washu: You'll see
