Visagothy (Prolouge)


Kiyone checked the monitor taking a glance at her partner Mihoshi
who was still sleeping even though the alarm was still going off. Their new
ship,
Razor had detected a battle in progress heading their way from saturn as
they
were leaving the atmosphere of earth. "Allready trouble and we just got into

orbit." Kiyone muttered to herself as she shook Mihoshi awake.

"What is it Kiyone." Mihoshi yawned and stretched her arms above
her head as Kiyone went to work on the controls in the seat next to her.

"Someones under attack and they're heading this way." Mihoshi
could hear the excitement in her friends voice as they headed toward the
disturbance.
Mihoshi started to match her friends nervous hyper state as they got closer.

Soon a huge shipp under attack by several smaller vessels appeared
infront of them as they got closer they astonished at the size of the
vessel. "That
ship must be the size of Tokyo." Mihoshi blurted out as they closer. The
ship suddenly picked up speed and headed in the direction of Earth. As it
passed over
them they could see the words in english underneath the metal leviathon "The

Fiery Red" in big blue letters.

The Razor quickly turned around and followed the running battle. When
the big ship reached an orbit around earth the battle damage began to take a
toll on
the super cruiser and explosions could be seen occurring all over it. Then
in one
collosal fire ball it explode taking half of it's attackers with it. Then a
small jet plane
like fighter emerged from the ball of fire and took out two other
starfighters right out.
Kiyone then gunned the Razor forward and headed into the melee.

J woke up from his slumber when someone was knocking on his door.
Still tired and wishing on not being disturbed he got up to answer the door.
He heard
K's voice as he was about to open it. "Hurry up slick we have an emergency."

"Hold on." J said with annoyance when he opened the door and let his
partner in. "Let me get my suit on"

Minutes later they were at MIB headquarters waiting to be briefed in
Zed's office. "We have a code yellow emergency." Zed said gruffly. "A city
size
ship was destroyed in orbit a few minutes ago and it sent what i think is a
distress
call."

"What do you mean think." Jay grumbled.

"The pilot of the ship just sent this message." Zed cleared his throat
as he picked up a piece of paper and read it. "Was attacked and had fun but
my
ship is destroyed and my fighter is going down and i am not sure where,
sighned
Ironhead."

"Isn't Ironhead the name of a famous bounty hunter." Kay said coolly.

"Yep, and we detected his fighter crashing in the country somewhere.
Its probably the same guy because he sent a message a week ago to let us
know
he was coming to visit family in Japan."

"Family?" J said with a look of puzzlement.

"His aunt or something"

A few minutes later J and K were outside getting into their car. "Whose
his aunt supposed to be." J enquired as they drove off towards the country
side
outside New York.

"Don't know but what I know about him he shouldn't have any family
at all." K said with a little puzzlement. "He was supposedly found by a guy
named
Mentor who took him in and by age ten was helping him as an active member of

Mentor's bounty hunting group."

"How old is he now?"

"Fifteen and he's already one of the most feared and liked bounty hunter
on this side of the Galaxy."

"Thats some accomplish." J said with surprise. "He must get Mentor a
lot  of cash."

"No. Mentor died and left him his ship. It was supposedly built by the
greatest mind in the universe ten thousand years ago."

"And who was that?"

"Washu Habuki, she was a friend of Mentor's."

Tenchi sat as he began to recover from the recent fight between Ryoko
and Aeka. He was coming down the stairs and without realizing it he was
caught in
the middle and took the full brunt of their attacks. His grandfather Yosho
told them
to go outside so he could recover. Tenchi massaged his temples as his
headache from
the hits began to die away. He stood and suddenly noticed. " Washu, you dont
need
a gueni pig do you?"

Washu looked over at Tenchi with a look of glee. "Nope, im just waiting
for someone." She said with glee.

"Who?" Tenchi asked.

"Oh, you'll find out." As she said this she let an evil smirk come across
her face.

Haven had laid down and hoped they think he was dying when they would
find him laying on the ground with his head wound. He had lost his ship and
lost his
favorite fighter. He had a plan and all it required was his aura leave his
body. He
floated aroun his body for few seconds then he spotted his unlucky targets
cautiosly
approach his unmoving body.

"Is he dead?" A big man asked. He prodded Havens body and when he
didn't move he let out a sigh of relief. "Well he's not moving, thats good."
The man
then started to turn the body over.

"What are you doing?" another man in a large black trench coat yelled.

"With all the trouble he gave us, I think I should have this sword." His
friend went back to trying to romove the scabbard holding a very large
sword. When
he failed to remove it he decided to just remove the sword. "Man this sword
is heavy
how can he lift this thing." The big man said as he tried to lift the sword
over is head.
When his friend didn't answer he looked up at him to see his friend with a
look of pure
horror upon his face.

He followed his friends gaze and saw a huge rabid looking pig heading at
full trot straight at them. Getting his bearings the big man dropped the
sword and
fired his blaster continuusly at the beast but the laser bolts seemed to go
through as if
he wasn't even there. Unable to move his friend was knocked off his feet and
into a
nearby tree. He was about to turn around and start firing at the creature
again but
a strong hand grabbed him and horror came upon his face as a face of young
teenage
looked at him with a smile on his face looked up at him.

"I recommend giving up now." The boy said. The man merely nodded.
"Go stand over by your friend, MIB will be here at any moment."

_____________________

When J and K reached the coordinates they were greeted by the unnusual
site of two scared men curled up in fetal position while what looked like a
giant rabid
pig stood over them. A few feet away a young teenager was sitting calmly
meditating
with his legs crossed. His eyes opened suddenly and a smile creeped across
his face.
"What took ya." A few minutes later a ship that looked much like a black
arrowhead
landed next to their car.
"Galaxy Police officers." K informed J.
"What are they doing here." J said.
As they stood and waited for the GP officers Mihoshi clmbed out of the
cockpit and waved at the two MIB agents as her and Kiyone made their way to
greet
them. Kiyone stopped in front of them and looked over the scene with a
somewhat
confused and dissapointed look. "What happened?" Before anyone could say
anything the pig disappeared and Haven was standing next to her.
"Are you Kiyone, one of Washu's friends?" Haven asked.
"Yes, and I'm Mihoshi." Mihoshi said with much enthusaism.
"Who are you." Kiyone blurted out.
"I'm Washu's nephew, Haven." The conversation continued on as they
talked about what Washu was up to and among other things. after a few
minutes the
J and K reminded them that they were there as well with a little cough but
were still
being ignored.
"Excuse me!" J yelled. The trio immediately stopped and turned their
attention over at the two men. "He has come down and sign over those two
pirates...
doesn't he."
"Forget the bounty, I don't have the time."

Haven was upset that he couldn't take some other mode of transportation
other that a jetliner. He was told he couldn't go with the GP officers
because they had patrol to do. He was uneasy in these vehicles mostly
because they always felt like
they were about to crash at any second to him. A plane ride was also what he
didn't
need after hours of paperwork at the MIB headquarters. "Um Stewardess?"
At hearing him the stewardess turned her attention to him. "Yes?" She
answered witha fake smile across her face. "How can I help you?"
"Is there a movie on this flight?" He asked.
"No." The stewardess said.
"How come there is in the movies but on this plane there isn't?"
Now looking slightly puzzled by his question she thought for the moment.
She stood there and stared at him for a minute but decided to just leave him
and let
him figure it out on his own. "Um, Stewardess?"
"This flight doesn't have a movie." She said as she walked away.
Deciding on not letting this go he got up and followed her to the front of
the
plane. "Why not?"
"Because this flight doesn't have one now sit down."
"But shouldn't all flights have movies?"
"SIT DOWN, NOW." As she said this her smile disappeared and was
replaced with a look of annoyance. To most people this would make other
people sit
down and forget about the matter, but Haven could never let anything stupid
go for
one reason. It was stupid and annoying people with stupid things was fun.
"Will you show a movie when I sit down?"
"No."
"You're not very good at your job then, who hired you anyway?"
"Sit down or else." She said this with her teeth clenched tight and her eyes
showed extreme anger and annoyance. Haven ignored her and continued on.
"Can we watch RoadTrip?"
"Sit down you little brat or I'll rip your fucking head off!" As she said
many people stopped what they were doing and looked over at them with
puzzled
looks. Haven stared at her for a few minutes with a mock look of shock doing
his
best not to smile.
"I hope you don't kiss your boyfriend with that mouth."
After this the stewardess let out a scream and began chasing him around the
plane. Through all this Haven was laughing as if it was just game, ducking
behind
food carts and leaping over emty seats. After an hour of this the stewardess
finally
had him cornered. She had herded Haven into one of the stalls where he
locked himself in as the stewardess threatened him. When she stopped he
opened the door
and peaked around it and the stewardess grabbed him by his shirt collar and
tied him
to his seat with the seat belts. While she was doing this the everyone in
the cabin
applauded. Haven tried to bow but the seat belts restrained his attempts.
