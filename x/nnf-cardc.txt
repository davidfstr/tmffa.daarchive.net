Tenchi doesn't belong to me, it makes me sad!  Card Captors doesn't 
either, but I can live with that.  Please don't sue me, I have nothing 
just some crazy ideas that i type to see what people think of it!  Thank 
you!

No Need For Card Captors

	"Teeennnccccchhhiiiii"
	"Ah!  Good Morning to you too Ryoko."
	"Get your hands off of Lord Tenchi  you monster."
	"Hey now..."
	"I said get of....."
	"Get away  from...."
	"AHHHHHH"
	A typical morning for the Masaki house, Tenchi just slipped off 
quietly to the kitchen to see what Sasami was cooking.
	"What's for breakfast this morning Sasami?"
	"Well, I thought I would start off with some rice balls and then 
make some special sugary dough,a dn then the rest I'm not sure yet.  
Hehe."
	"That sounds good.  I'll go tell Washu it's almost ready.."
	"I did again!!  I am truly the greatest scientist in the world!! 
HAHAHAH!"
	"Your the greatest Washu.  Washu,  you are the best!  
Washu!Washu!Washu!"
	"Washu...what is so great?"
	"Yes Miss Washu."
	"Well Ryoko and Ayeka, I just made the greatest invention of 
history!  WAHAHAHA!"
	"What is it Miss Washu?"
	"It's a world teleporter!"
	"A what?"
	"Well  Mihoshi if you didn't watch cartoons all day, you would 
have an idea of what it is.  A world teleporter can teleport an object 
or person to any desired location.  Would anyone like to try it out?"  
No one answers from fear of past inventions.  "Well then we'll all go 
together.  HAHAHA"  Everyone stepped into Washu's lab frightfully.  
"Okay now everyone, stand on that blue circle in front of you.  Now 
where would we like to go?"
	"How about Disney World?"  Murmers of agreement where heard.
	"Well Disney World it is Sasami."  Washu typed in a few 
coordinates and pressed a few buttons before she leapt into the circle.  
"Get ready, Disney World here we come!"   A sudden blur of colors and a 
rush of wind came into the faces of the masaki household.   "Well here 
we are."  Everyone stood in awe infront of the Magic  Kingdom entrance.
	"Well come on Tenchi!"
	"Who said Tenchi was going with you!?"  Again the two girls 
already started fighting over Tenchi.  After all the fighting and 
arguing Ayeka, Sasami, and Mihoshi went to the fantasy land, because of 
Ayeka's fear of heights, Tenchi and Ryoko went to the parts and Washu 
wandered around  the shops with Kiyone.
	"Oh, Tenchi!  Finally atlast it's just you and me.  We're going to 
have so much fun!  Well come on we're not going to have fun by standing  
here, let's go!"  She quickly grabbed his hand and walked toward the 
speed way.  Tenchi just smiled and tried to catch up.

	"I can't believe Ryoko is going off with Tenchi like that!  If 
only I didn't fear heights."
	"Hehe Come on Ayeka!"  Ayeka tried not to think of all the fun 
RYoko would be having with Tenchi as she went with Sasami to the rides.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~
	"Well Tenchi we went on the speedway, the magic mountain, and the 
rocket ship ride.  What's next?"
	"Hmmm, how about the metroway?"
	"Of course!!"  She happily skipped, still holding Tenchi's hand, 
off to the metroway.
	"Two please."
	"Right this way"  the man lead them to a cart of their own.
	"Wow, this is going to be so much fun Tenchi.  Come sit next to 
me."  Usually in this situation Tenchi would  be nervous but for  some 
reason he actually wanted to sit next to her.  (Maybe it's because I'm 
not worried about Ayeka seeing me...?)
	"Alright Ryoko."  Ryoko's heart skipped a beat  as Tenchi sat 
close next  to her.  As the speed started to pick up Ryoko rested her 
head on Tenchi's shoulder.
	"Tenchi?"
	"Ya, Ryoko?"
	"What are you thinking about>"
	"Well uh...I guess about  how much fun I've had with you today."
	"Really!?!"
	"Of course Ryoko."  As they entered the tunnel of the ride Ryoko 
put her head on his chest.
	"Tenchi, today has been a dream come true for me.  
I....Well....you..."
	"RYoko?"
	"Tenchi,...I l..love....you"
	"Ryoko, I..."
	"But even if you don't love me...I guess I'm fine with that.  But 
no matter how you feel about me, I'll always love you."  She got up and 
looked at him through his eyes.  Tenchi noticed her eyes were stained 
with tears.
	"Ryoko.  Im so sorry..."
	"I understand...after all how woild love a monster like me."  She 
started to cry as she sat on the other side, curled like a ball, looking 
out.
	"No...your not a monster.  what I meant was...I'm sorry for having 
you go through  so much pain  waiting for me.  Ryoko, you are 
passionate, caring, beautiful and you only act tough to cover it up.  
I....Well...I love you too Ryoko."  She slowly looked up and started to 
cry even more.  "Ryoko...what is it?!?!"
	"I  never  thought in a million lifetimes that you would ever love 
a person like me."  He smiled and sat next to her, holding her crying 
body.  They sat like this until the cart came out of the  tunnel and 
into the sunlight again.
	"Now dry up those pretty eyes and smile for me."  She sniffled and 
wiped her eyes and then managed a chessy grin for Tenchi.  "HAHAHAHA!  
Thanx Ryoko."  She stayed in Tenchi's arms in silence until the cart 
reached a stop at the station.  "Well  where to next?"  Ryoko smiled and 
laughed.  
	"I think we should check how everyone else is doing.  We WERE 
supposed to meet at the train staion at 2:30.  What time is it?"
	"AH!  It's 2:25!"
	"Well then lets hurry!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~
	"Where is that Ryoko!  I just know she has hurt poor Lord Tenchi!  
I knew I shouldn't have let her go with him!  She better sho up soon!  
If she.."
	"Ayeka...please.  Tenchi  is fine, Ryoko wouldn't do anything to 
hurt Tenchi!"
	"There's the cevil woman now!  Ryoko if you have hurt a single.."
	"Relax Ayeka, Ryoko  didn't hurt me at all!"
	"Well children, hehehe, it's time for us to head back  don't you 
think?!?  Stand around  everyone while I type in some coordinates to get 
back to home...here we go."  The scenery of what used to be disney 
suddenly became a bright blurr of colors with a rush of wind.  "well 
here we....are???"
	"Miss Washu where  are we?"
	"It  seems that we were lost...in another world..."
	"WHHHHAAAAAA?  You mean to tell me that you lost us in another 
world!?!?!"
	"Oh Lord Tenchi watch out there might be danger near!!"
	"Everybody calm  down!!!!!!"  The  murmers of excitement sooned 
quieted.  "it's obvious that we are in another location, may not be 
another world but....FREAKIN OUT isn't going to solve anything.  Washhu 
can you fix this?"
	"Well Tenchi it seems my computer has been overrun...uh 
hehe....um.....I KNOW!   Why don't you all split up  and have alook 
around where we are while my computer cools down!"  Soon the worried 
cries turned into nods of  agreement.
	"Well I'll go with Lord Ten.."
	"Oh no you don't miss prissy  pants you're not going anywhere with 
Tenchi..."
	"Get your hands off of him..."
	"Oh try to stop me...nanana..."
	"Ryoko!"
	"Hey hey!  Come on now..I'll go with you both."
	"Uh OK!" they cried in unison while glaring evilly at each other.
	"Hey there's a park other there!"
	"This looks like a city!"
	"Look over there!"
	"Well come on Tenchi!"
	"Yes follow me Lord Tenchi."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~
	"Thats all for today  class, be safe this weekend, and have fun!"
	"Hey Mei Lin! Are you coming with us today to the park?"
	"Um....sure I guess."
	"Well then let's go!  First I have to stop by my house to pick up 
Kiro
	"Not that stuffed animal!  Hahaha"
	"He's not so  bad." 
	"The wind  seems  strange  today...doesn't it?"
	"What do you mean Sakura?"
	"Um..never mind it's nothing.  Here we are.  I'll be a sec!  Kiro, 
Kiro, there you are, come on Mei Lin and I are going to the park!"
	"The park?!?!  Not now, I've almost defeated the Red Warrior in 
Level 3!!!"
	"Come on Kiro, I'll buy you some putting...."
	"All right!"
	"Okay Mei Lin  let's go!"
	"Wait up Sakura..."
	"What is it Kiro?"
	"I sense  a clow card...."
	"You do?"
	"I  thought I did earlier...wait a minute...I've never  seen them 
before....they look strange...."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~
	"Here's the park...hey...why  are they staring at us like that?"
	"Well we are obviously dressed different then them and looked a 
lot different.  They are probbaly just curious."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"They see us!"
	"Come on Mei Lin let's follow them!"
	"Sakura be careful, something is definetly wrong around here."
	"What do you mean Kiro?"
	"Those people don't seem normal.."
	"You don't think they could....."
                **BOOM**
	"Ryoko!  Get away from Lord Tenchi right away!!"
	"Ayeka can't you see  we are meant for each other!"
	"Girls come on!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"I told you Sakura...one of them is a clow card!!"
	"A Clow card?  Sakura they don't look like clow cards!"
	"Thats because they arn't the average clow cards Mei Lin."
	"They arn't?"
	"No, look at the one with the purple hair, thats the clow card.  
It's gotta be the JEALOUS or the ****** card."
	"Well come on  Sakura let's get that  card!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"There's those kids again, wha...what is she doing..?"
	"Unleash the wand!"
	"Uh..Tenchi  doesn't this kid seem a little weird to you..?"
	"Step back  I'll take care of this card!"
	"Card..?"
	"HAHAHA, Ayeka you're a card!!!"
	"Sakura seal it while it's confused!!"
	"JEALOUS card I seal you to the card confined!"  As Sakura 
thrusted down her wand to "capture" the JEALOUS card, Ayeka looked 
puzzled and started to get angry and scream.
	"I'm not a stuped card,  and I'm not jealous!"
	"Sakura it didn't work...maybe it's not her thats the card but the 
other girl..THATS IT!!! She's the GIGGLE card!"
	"Wha?"
	"HAHAHAHA...now whos the card Ryoko!"  Tenchi continued to look  
confused.
	"Don't even try it little girl!"
	"GIGGLE ca...AHHHH!"
	"I warned you..that little wand  won't touch me!"
	"Sakura use the wind card!"
	"Right...Wind card...RELEASE!"  Just then a huge gust of wind  
aroused and started blowing Aykea and Tenchi towards the playground.
	"AH!"
	"TENCHI!! NO!!  You dare hurt Tenchi!"
	"Uh..Sakura..."
	"Ya Mei Lin?"
	"I don't think thats the GIGGLE card!" With that Sakura, Mei Lin 
and Kiro started runnin off to the alleys.  Ryoko at first started to 
chase them but then stop to check on Tenchi.
	"Tenchi!  Are you ok?"
	"Uh ya Ryoko they didn't hurt us."
	"Where did they go?"
	"I dunno, but i don't care.  They got really annoying.  Are all 
the  people here like that?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Is she still following us?"
	"No, Sakura I don't know what happened I'm sure I felt a clow 
card.  As a matter of fact i can still sense it."
	"Kiro, they weren't clow cards, but they weren't regular people 
either."
	"AHHH, Sakura!"
	"Mei Lin!  I forgot to seal the WIND card!  WIND card return to 
your power confined! WIND!  Sorry Mei Lin.....?!?!?!?"
	"Sakura it's not only the wind card!!!!"
	"What is it?!"
	"Thats the clow card!  It's the....SPEED card!"
	"The speed card?"
	"No time hurry Sakura!"
	"Right..." 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Woh...the wind just stopped all of  a sudden..."
	"Tenchi..something is wrong here, I can sense it."
	"You're right Miss Ryoko"
	"Come on!"  The two girls grabbed Tenchi and started  runnig for 
the alley.
	"Wha...what...is it?"  A medium sized, what looked like a  wolf, 
demon appeared and was running aroundthe alleys causing a whirl  wind.
	"There's those two kids!"
	"WAH!  That thing is fast!" 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Use the  TIME card Sakura!"
	"Right Kiro!  TIME card....UNLEASH!"  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	Then the time stopped...but for some reason only for Mei Lin and 
Tenchi!
	"What did you do!?!?!"
	"What is wrong with Lord Tenchi...why has everything stopped!"
	"It was that little girl!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Uh Oh!  Sakura those two girls arn't frozen!"
	"WHAT!?!?"
	"Hold on...I'll deal with them, you watch the SPEED card!"
	"Right!"
	"Hey!  You two!  What it going on!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Is that little stuffed, flying thing talking to us?"
	"I guess, well I hope he's ready for some question and answer 
time!"
	"All right what did you do to Lord Tenchi?"
	"HUH??  Oh that guy that was with you, well Sakura  froze time in 
order to capture the TIME card, and for some reason it didn't freeze you 
or your frined here."
	"How come it didn't freeze you?"	
	"Because I'm not human..I'm a super guardian!"
	"HAHAHA!  Not human maybe but guardian!!"
	"Well Miss Ryoko and I are  definetly not huuman either!"
	"UH..OK!  So thats why you didn't freeze !"
	"Well that guy is getting on my nerves!  DO  you mind if I help  
bring him down?"
	"Yes I would like to have my try at it also!"
	"WHAT??  UH go ahead!"
	"Come on Ayeka..lets see how weak you are!"
	"I wouldn't be talking you old pirate!"  So Ryoko and Ayeka 
started to fight the SPEED card, while Sakura took a rest and watched in 
awe at how fast they were.
	"How...wha...oh my...how are they that fast?!?!  And why didn't 
they freeze Kiro??"
	"They arn't human they said..  Sakura pay attention they may be 
able to defeat the card but only you can seal it.  When I say so, seal 
the card."
	"Right."
	"Ready....now!"  Sakura ran in with her wand ready to seal the 
SPEED card.
	"SPEED card return to your power confined...SPEED!"  With that the 
demon was sucked into  tiny card.
	"That  was all you had to do?!?!  Any one can do that!"
	"Um excuse me, now that you captured your demon can  you please 
unfreeze Lord Tenchi?"
	"Oh right.. TIME card return to your power confined...TIME!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"So, why are you two all of a sudden buddies? And why does my head 
hurt so bad?"
	"Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka!  There you are!"
	"We've been looking for you, the weirdest thing happened, I had 
this dream that Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Mr. Masaki were frozen and Washu 
and I were left!"
	"Now Sasami that would never happen would it?"
	"HEHEHE no!"  Washu sent a questioning glance  at the two girls, 
who had grins on their faces.
	"Washu, next time we go somewhere send objects first and not us!"  
Everyone laughed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~
	"Kiro, who were those two girls?  And where did they come from?"
	"I don't know Sakura, I guess they were sent here to help you..."
	"I can't believe I missed that capture!!!!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~


I've watched Card captors a few times so I had an idea how things worked 
but, I forgot most of the characters and how Sakura captures 
cards....WAS IT THAT BAD!?!?!!?  This was my first cross over, and I 
might do another one but  not with Card Captors, maybe with SAilor Moon, 
or someone else!  BIBI!
