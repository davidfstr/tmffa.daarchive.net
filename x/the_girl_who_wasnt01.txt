Summary:  Ranma is finally free of the fiancee mess
and in a quest to find his cure stumbled upon a
place called the Masaki shrine.  There he meets a
young pretty girl named Achika Masaki.







The Girl who wasn't and the Princess who was.


Chapter 1.

It was a peaceful night at the Tendo residence.

	Alone in the dojo, Ranma sat enjoying the
moment which was all too rare.  Given an hour ago,
anyone passing by would have heard the yells and
screams of 'tomboy' and 'pervert'.  And who could
forget the resounding battle cry of 'Ranma no Baka!'

	It was another fight, just like the others
in a long string of never ending mayhem.  Ranma
shook his head, which had yet another lump in it
thanks to 'Mallet-sama'.  And that was the problem.
In over the past year of staying in the Tendo home,
he and Akane were still fighting as if he had just
gotten there the day before.

	"Nothing changes..."  he sighed.  It had
been two months since the failed wedding attempt.
He had hoped that with such a drastic event,
everyone would finally seen things in focus and
realize that things had just gone too far.  He had
also hoped against hope that Ukyou, Shampoo, and
Kodachi would finally give up on him, and that Akane
and he could finally come to an understanding.

	"If only she wasn't so jealous, and short
tempered, and could cook, and..."

	Things seemed to look better the first week
after the wedding.  Both Shampoo and Ukyou had
apologized for the destruction they caused.  Akane
had even stopped hitting him.  But paradise didn't
last; and then things got back to 'normal'.

	The bickering, the arguing, the rivalries,
all of it came back in full force.  He had forgiven
everyone for all the trouble that they had caused,
and everyone took it as a sign to resume what they
had been doing before.  Shampoo was back to her
'glomp of death', his father and Mr.  Tendo were
again hounding him about the engagement, and Akane
was once more sending him on those one way trips
into the great blue yonder.

	Ukyou had come by that afternoon.  Before
she left, Ukyou had dropped off one of her specials
for him.  As luck would have it Akane came home just
in time to run into the 'cute' fiance.  Seeing the
package, the inevitable argument began.  It ended
with his foot in his mouth and Akane's mallet on his
head.

	And that brought him back to the present.

	"The Kami must hate me!"  He groaned feeling
the dull ache in his head.

"A yen for your thoughts Ranma?"  a voice asked.

	Facing the direction from where the voice
came, Ranma saw its source.  "Hi mom."

       The handsome woman looked at her son fondly.
Nokoda, matriarch of the Satome clan was dressed in
her usual kimono and the ever-present Saotome family
blade was strapped to her back.

	 "Do you want to talk about it?"  She asked
taking a seat in the dojo next to him.

	"I'm just trying to figure out why my life
is so messed up."  He said.

"Oh, is that all."  Nodoka said smiling.

"You think I'm being silly don't you?"

	"Not at all dear.  But the way you put it,
it seems that the weight of the world is on your
shoulders."  (1)

"Well it feels like it.  "

	"Is it because of the argument that you and
Akane had?  My son these things happen..."

	"But they've been happening for the past
year now.  After all we've gone through, Anake and I
are still at each other's throats.  Then there's
Ukyou and Shampoo.  They're still after me.  They
just don't give up.  And I don't even want to
mention Kodachi.  If any or all of them ever get
together everything just explodes.  "

	Ranma frowned.  "Things have gotten so out
of hand.  I just don't know what do any more.  It's
like my life is a leaking roof.  I have on drip
coming down so I get a bucket to catch the water.
But when I get there another drip pops up.  When I
get a bucket for that, two more appear and it just
keeps going from there.  I can't keep up anymore and
I'm all out of buckets."

	Nokoda had never seen this side of her son
before.  He was best known for his brashness, and
arrogance.  Ranma's tenacity, his refusal to give up
in front of any odds was his trademark.  But what
Nokoda heard now, the tone in his voice.  It
conveyed the loneliness and despair within his
heart.

	 Doing only what a mother could do, she held
him close to her and gently rocked him.  "I never
knew Ranma, I never knew..."  Nodoka cursed herself.
Her dreams, which she shared with Genma of joining
the two families, had blinded her from her son's
pain.  She had only the best intentions, wishing
that Ranma have a good wife by his side as he walked
the road of life.  She had become quite fond of
Akane during her time with the Tendos.  With the
wedding, her wishes were almost realized.  But with
that disaster, and now this...  Her eyes were now
open.

	 "Thanks mom, I needed that."  He quickly
wiped his eyes.  'Crying was un- manly', he reminded
himself.

	"Ranma, tell me something."  Nodoka spoke.
"What do you want to do?"

"What do you mean?"

	"I just wanted to know.  If you could do
anything you wanted.  What would it be?"

	"I-I don't know..."  He frowned.  "What do
you want me to do mom?  I'll do what ever you want."

	"Oh, Ranma."  She let out a rich laugh.
"You are my treasure, and I am so proud that you are
my son.  I know that, that which you hate most is to
see those whom you care about hurt.  But I
understand now that you can't live your life based
on the wishes of others."

	"Mom..."

	"Now close your eyes.  That's right.  Clear
your mind.  Forget about the engagements, the
fights, and the problems.  Think about what you
want, Ranma.  Look deep in your heart.  What is it
that you wish with your life?"

	With his eyes shut, Images flashed through
his mind.  Akane smiling at him.  Ukyou fixing him
an okonomiyaki, even fighting with Ryoga.  The
pictures jumbled in his mind.  Then one by one they
faded away leaving only one image.  It was what 'he'
wanted.

	"I...  I want to find a cure for my curse," 
he said simply.

	"I know your feelings for the other girls,
but what about Akane?  I know that you care for her
the most, though you still wish to hide it."

	"I care about her a lot...  but I don't want
to get married yet.  At least not that way I am now.
When I do get married I don't want any one forcing
me to do so, and I want to be cured.  And maybe then
it might be her..."

	Nodoka nodded her head.  "I'm glad to hear
you make your own decisions now.  You've grown to be
a fine young man.  Is it any wonder why the girls
chase you so?"

	"Well, what good does it do me?  You know
how Pop and Mr.  Tendo feels about the engagement.
And besides, that family honor is at stake also.  I
can't leave my responsibility.  I'm right back where
I started.  Nothing changes..."  He sighed in
resignation.

	Nokoda studied her son, her expression
serious.  In a few moments she had come to a
decision.  The hardest decision that she had to ever
make.  But her mind was clear.  'Sometimes you just
had to let go of the things you love most'

	"Don't be too sure of that Ranma.  To live,
is to embrace change."

	"I guess..."  he said, unconvinced.

	From the house Kasumi's voice could be
heard.  "Everyone, dinner is ready."

	"Ranma."  Nodoka spoke, stopping her son
from getting up.  "Sit with me for a while longer.
We rarely get to be together like this."  'And these
times will get rarer still' she thought to herself.

	"Sure mom, I'd like that too."


****----***----****

	"Another excellent dinner, Kasumi" Genma
said patting his paunch.

	"Just like your dear mother use to make!"
Soun seconded, suppressing a sob.

       "Thank you Mr.  Saotome.  Thank you father."
Kasumi said getting up.  "Would anyone like some
more tea?"

	"Kasumi dear, could you sit down for a
moment?  Every else please remain seated.  I have an
announcement to make," Nodoka said.

	All eyes turned to the older woman with
interested looks.  Ranma raised an eyebrow.  After
their talk at the dojo, his mother had been
unusually quiet.  Barely making conversation at the
dinner table, only to approve of Kasumi's meal.
Even as he had fought his father over the meal for
the pieces of food, he read a troubled expression on
her face which no one else seemed to notice.

	"What's up mom?"  He asked a bit warily.

	"Ranma, this evening when we talked at the
dojo, I finally understood what you are facing and
the stress it has put on you.  What was once a
time-honored tradition of engaging your child to
another in hopes of bettering their lives, has
turned into a circus.  The multiple fiances, the
bitter disputes, and the curses have brought nothing
but chaos and destruction into your life.  The
failed wedding is proof of this."  She paused to
glare at her husband.

	Genma who was sitting Nodoka was beginning
to sweat.  His eyes darted around the room looking
for quick exits for an escape.

	Nodoka continued.  "In trying to do what was
best for my son, I made the mistake of neglecting to
ask him what he thought what was best for him.  I
plan to remedy this mistake.  Tonight I asked my son
what 'he' wanted.  I had judged him as a man, and a
man is responsible enough to make his own decisions.
Because of this, I have decided to no longer support
the engagement to the Tendo's, or any of the
engagements the my idiot husband has agreed to."

	There was silence as everyone's minds raced
to digest what Nodoka had just said.  Both Genma and
Soun looked wide-eyed, disbelieving what they had
heard.  Nabaki's eyes narrowed, thinking of the
repercussions that would soon follow.  Akane felt a
hollowness grow within her.  The hundreds of times
which she had declared of never wanting to marry
Ranma were coming back to haunt her.

	Ranma was just as shocked as the rest of the
family.  For almost the last two years, his
existence had revolved around the engagement to
Akane.  Now the world was being turned upside down.
'Things are changing...'

	It was Kasumi who broke the silence.  "Oh
my!"  And the room exploded.

	"The two houses must be joined!"  Genma and 
Soun echoed

	"Why don't you ask Ranma what he wants?"  
Nodoka suggested

	"It doesn't matter what the boy wants!  This
is a matter of honor!"  Genma said clenching his
fist in a noble pose.

	"Ranma, you do want to marry my daughter
Akane?  Don't you?"  Soun pleaded.  He was on the
verge of bursting into tears.

	Ranma glanced back and forth between his
father, Mr.  Tendo and his mother.  Then he saw
Akane's face.

	"Ranma?"  the youngest Tendo daughter
questioned.  Her expression was void of any emotion.

	"Akane, I..."  He felt himself faltering.
Then his mother's words came to him.  '...you can't
live your life based on the wishes of others.'

	"Akane, I don't want to marry you.  I'm not
ready for it.  I want to do some things for myself
first.  Like find a cure for my curse.  I'm
sorry..."  He turned his face away, and looked down
at the floor.

       "I see."  she said.  Her voice was cracking.
She got up from the table.  "Please excuse me
everyone.  I-I have some homework I need to
finish..."  She quickly ascended the stairs,
hurrying so that no one would see the tears.

	"Now the two schools will never be
joined!!!"  Soun wailed, as soon as Akane left.

	"Chear up Soun!"  Genma said consoling his
friend.  "Ranma might not marry Akane, but you still
have two other daughters."

The two remaining girls looked at each other.

	"Father," Kasumi said.

	"Daddy," Nabiki said.

	Before either could continue, Nodoka
interjected.  "Don't worry yourselves girls.  No one
will force you into a marriage you don't want
either.  "

	They both looked at her gratefully and
quickly excused themselves.

"Genma, I said that I would no longer support the
engagements."  She said dangerously.

	"But dear, " Genma said, cringing from his
wife.  "The honor of the Saotome family is at stake.
The pledge that Tendo and I made stated that our
children would marry to unite the schools.  I can
not take back my word.  To do so would plunge the
Saotome name into shame."

	"And what about the other engagements?  Did
you plan on just conveniently forgetting them?

	"Well I...  er..."  Grabbing a glass of
water, he splashed himself.  He pulled out his sign
saying <I'm just a cute panda>

	Nodoka shook her head wearily.  "Genma you
foolish man you.  How could you have been so
careless with our son's welfare?  Your unthinking
actions have forced my hand."  She paused trying to
compose herself.

	"So that my son will be free of the
obligations that my husband has unjustly placed on
him, and so that the Saotome honor can be
maintained, I here by disown my son Ranma from the
Saotome clan.

	"Mom!"  Ranma gasped.  A faint "Oh my."  Was
heard from upstairs.  "Genma!  Do something!"  Soun
begged.  Panda sign.  <Nodoka, be reasonable!>

	"I'm sorry Ranma, but this is the only way, 
" Nodoka said.

	"But I don't want to lose you."

	"Lose me?  No Ranma, you can never lose me.
I have loved you since that day you were born.  I
have loved you though we were apart for ten years,
and I shall always love you.  Your life is your own
now Ranma.  What you make of it is up to you."

	"Thank you mother."  He gave her a hug.

	"That will be the last that you will be able
to call me that Ranma.  And this will be that last
time that I can call you my son..."

	Giving her a kiss on the cheek, Ranma got up
and ran up the stairs to pack his things.


(-------------------------------------------------)


It was a clear day.

	At least it was clear now.  A spring shower
had come by earlier, lasting only long enough to
soak a certain martial artist and trigger a certain
curse.  Ranma wasn't surprised.  She was use to
being a 'water magnet'.

	Ranma took a deep breath of the fresh air.
She marched along with a firm stride.  She wore her
usual red shirt and ankle tied black pants.  She
also carried a massive backpack holding the few
wordily possessions she had.

Sunlight filtered down through the emerald branches
of the trees painting the ground in marble pattern
of light and shade.  She enjoyed the quiet solitude
of the forest as she walked.

	Three weeks had passed since she had left
the Tendo home.  Mr.  Tendo was an inconsolable
wreck.  Her father seemed no better.  She found out
that his mother and father were also moving out of
the Tendo home shortly after her.  Nodoka had
decided that they should no longer impose upon the
Tendo's.

	She had left on good terms with Kasumi and
Nabiki, both of them wishing her well.  Akane wasn't
there to send him off though.

	Even now she could see the pain on Akane's 
face.

****----***----****

	"Akane?"  Ranma said speaking to the wooden
duck with Akane's name carved on it.  "Akane, it's
me.  I...  I just wanted to talk...  Akane?"  He
knocked on the door a few more times.

	He took a breath.  "Akane, I just wanted to
apologize for everything.  The engagement, the
fights...  You're not uncute or a tomboy.  And your
definitely not built like a brick.  I just said
those things to get back at you for the things you
did to me...  I'm sorry, Akane.  Good-bye," he said.
With a sigh he headed down the stairs.

Just then, the door opened.  "Ranma..."

"Akane..."  He could tell that she had been crying.

	"You're not a pervert," She said looking at
him.  "But you're still a jerk."  Forcing a smile.

	"And you can't cook."  He said returning the
smile.  He instantly regretted what he said, seeing
her expression.

	"Akane, I didn't..."

	"It's all right Ranam..."  Sadness showed on 
her face.

	Ranma saw this and tried his best to console
her.  "Akane, you got nothing to worry about now.
Nobody's going to force you to do things any more.
And you don't have to worry about Ukyou and Shampoo
trying to kill you or poison you.  Besides, who'd
want to marry a sex changing pervert like me
anyway?"  he said jokingly.

	Before he could do anything, he found Akane
on top of him.  He closed his eyes, expecting a
mallet, for having put his foot in his mouth again.
It never came.  Instead he felt something warm and
soft tough his lips.

	Akane stepped back breaking the kiss.  "I
would have."  She said, answering his question.

	Ranma stood there dumfounded.  "Akane, I...  
I..."

	"Ranma no baka" Akane said softly.  She
turned her face, which was wet with tears.  And with
a 'click' her door was closed.

****----***----****

	'It's not too late.  I could still go
back..."  she thought to herself.  Ranma felt her
resolve crumble, as Akane's face formed in her mind.
But then another voice spoke within her.

       'That part of your life is over.  It is time
to move on.  Isn't this what you wanted?  Freedom?
Change?  Will you give up your dreams so easily?"

	And then all was clear, the last traces of
uncertainty were banished.  She continued her pace
with firm purpose.  With that, she closed that
chapter of her life.

	Ranma unfolded her map.  The most obvious
place to begin his search for a cure would have been
China.  This is why that early on she had decided
that it would be the last place she would go to.
She was quite sure that the moment she set foot in
China, she would be facing Shampoo, Cologne, and the
might of the entire Amazon tribe.  Once she had
exhausted all his options in Japan, she would
consider going to China.

	She had already come up with some possible
leads for a cure.  While searching in one of the
public libraries, there had been some references to
an old book, which was suppose to have been able to
grant three wishes to the person who found it.  It
was called the "Book of Four Gods of the Earth and
Sky".

	Another possibility Ranma picked up on was
some information on strange occurrences of daimons
roaming around Juuban.  Battling the daemons were a
group of young girls calling themselves the Sailor
Senshi.  Their leader was some chick named Sailor
Moon who had supposedly healed people of Daimons
possession.

	The last place on her list of most likely
places was a small holy shrine located in one a
rural regions of Japan.  There had been some written
accounts of various people traveling there to pray
for cures for various afflictions.  A number of them
were actually healed.

	Coming to a decision on which trail to
follow first, Ranma had picked the third one.  She
had enough experience with wishes gone wrong, or not
coming out the way the user intended.  And her ego
just wouldn't let him go crawling to a bunch of
underdressed girls for help.

	'Hmm...  I'm pretty close now.'  She looked
at the unfolded map on the ground.  Judging from
where she was, she guessed that she was only a
little less than twenty miles from her goal.  She
was confident that she could get there before the
day was out, with time to spare.

	'Thank Kami I'm not like Ryoga.  No way in
hell I'd ever find this place.'  She carefully
folded up the map, placing it in one of the pockets
of her backpack.  Somewhere out there, a certain
martial artist with fangs sneezed.  (2)

	Checking to make sure that everything was
secure, Ranma started out again.  She bounded
through the woods, strong legs carrying her over,
bushes, rocks, and trees as she made her way to the
Masaki shrine.  (3)

****----***----****

	A faint blush of red touched the afternoon 
sky over the Masaki shrine.

	Most of the patrons had gone for the day.
And, except for a young girl sweeping the steps the
place would have been deserted.

       She dressed in a garb befitting that of a
Shinto shrine maiden.  Her long black hair was done
up in a ponytail, which reached down her back.  With
a morose expression, she swept the ground.

	'Nothing changes.'  Achika Masaki, daughter
of Katsuhito Masaki, the keeper of the Masaki
shrine, thought to herself.  Tending the shrine had
been a routine part of her life ever since she was a
little girl.  She had nothing against the traditions
of the shrine, it was just that tradition was so
boring.

	 It happened every summer as school ended.
While other children enjoyed their vacation with
outings and trips, she spent her time tending the
family shrine.  She didn't mind the work though.  In
fact she took her responsibilities very seriously.
It was the lack of her friends, which she found
difficult.

	The Shrine was located in one of the last
remaining untouched areas of Japan, hidden from the
modern world.  Its remote location made visiting
friends difficult at best.  Sometimes her friends
did come to visit, staying over for a time.  But
there was little at the shrine to keep teenage girls
occupied.  Namely, teenage boys.

	Achika sighed as she resigned herself to
another vacation of peaceful solitude.

	Her peaceful solitude was broken when she
felt a touch on her shoulder.

	"Excuse me?"  a voice, said.

	 "Eeep!!!"  Achika jumped.  She hadn't heard
anyone behind her.  She spun around, taking her
broom and gripping it like a sword.

	"Ack!"  Exclaimed the redheaded girl now in
front of her.  She instantly leaned back to avoid
the wild swing of the broom.  As she did so, the
massive backpack she carried caused her to lose
balance.  With a thump, the redhead fell backwards.

	Achika's eyes widened, as her heart got back
to it's normal pace.  "Are you all right?"  She
asked the prone form in front of her.

	"Uuuuggh..."  replied the fallen girl
struggling to sit up right.

	Achika dropped the broom and was quickly by
the girl's side.  "Here, let me help you.  I'm sorry
about that.  I didn't hear you come up behind me."

	"No problem."  Said the girl, sitting up.
"It was my fault.  I didn't mean to startle ya.  I
tried to get your attention before, but ya didn't
hear me."

	"I guess I was daydreaming."  Achika said 
lamely.

	"Yeah, I do that a lot too."  The redhead
smiled as she stood up.

	"Well in any case, welcome to the Masaki
shrine," Achika said bowing.  "I'm Achika Masaki, my
father is the priest here."  She returned the smile.

	"Hi, I'm Ranm...  Ranko!"  she said
scratching the back of her head.  "Pleased to meet
you!  Ya have a very nice place here.  I really hope
that it's not customary to attack the visitors."
She said wryly.

	Achika found Ranko's laughter contagious.
Soon both of them were laughing.  She noticed that
Ranko laughed out loud, with out restraint, like a
boy would.  The redhead wore Chinese cloths, which
were a little large though snug enough to show off
her form.  And, judging from that large pack she
carried, Ranko was stronger than she looked.

	"What brings you to the Masaki shrine?"  
Achika inquired.

	"Well, I...  just wanted to look around and
see what's here.  I read about this place in some
books.  It seemed very special.  I wanted to find
out for myself.  Would it be ok if I look around?"

       'I could always finish my chores later,'
Achika thought.  Besides, she missed being around
others her own age.  "How about I show you around,
Ranko?"

	"That would be great."

	Achika smiled.  "Follow me then."


****----***----****


	Two girls walked down a dirt trail through 
the woods.

	"It's very peaceful here," Ranko said.

	"Yes, it is."  Achika sighed, recalling her 
dilemma.

	"Is something wrong with that?

	"Nothing, I guess, if you like it.  But it's
always like that here.  Nothing exciting ever
happens.  Every year it's the same thing.  Just
another peaceful summer."

	"Ya won't hear me complaining."  Ranko shut
her eyes enjoying the calm.

	"So, Ranko, where are you from?"

	"Nerima..."

	"What's it like there?"

	"Pretty hectic.  So many thing going on at
once that it was hard to keep track of all of them.
It's good to finally get away."

	"I guess that saying is true."

	"What saying?"

	"The grass is always greener..."  Achika 
laughed.

"I guess so," Ranko said rubbing her chin and
smiling.

	"We're here."  Achika said after a few more
minutes of walking.  She stopped in front of a cave
decorated with wards.

	"What is this place?"  Ranko asked.
Something about this place caused her some unease.

	"This is the demon cave of the Masaki 
shrine."

	"Demon?"

       "Um-hum.  It's the legend of how the Masaki
shrine was founded.  Almost seven hundred years ago
a demon fell to the earth.  It was an evil creature,
large enough to walk over mountains, strong enough
to pick them up and crush them.  Its eyes burned
with anger and it shot out fire from its mouth.
Ryoko was its name.

	No one could stop it, and it seemed that the
world was fated to be destroyed.  But then a warrior
flew down from the heavens, riding a ship in the
shape of a dragon.  He carried a sword of light in
hands, and set forth to slay the demon.  The
warrior's name was Yosho.

	Yosho and Ryoko fought for two days and two
nights.  It was on the third day that Ryoko was
finally defeated.  Yosho placed the remains of the
demon in this very cave, and sealed the place with
his sword.  Since that time, Yosho's descendants
have cared for the shrine.  "

	"Ahhh..."  Ranko said.  "Wish I could have 
seen the
fight."

	"It's true!"  Achika said defensively.  She
thought she was being teased.  Her friends had
laughed, the times they had come up to visit her,
when she had told the story.  She couldn't blame
them because it did sound like something out of a
fairy tail.  But she had been told the tale ever
since she could remember.  And the way her father
had told it made it seem all the more real.

	"I believe you," Ranko said seriously.
"I...  I can feel it.  I think it's watching us."

Achika smiled.  "Yes, when ever I come here I sense
I'm being watched.  When I was a little girl, I
played a game and talked to Ryoko."  She walked up
to the mouth of the cave and bowed.  "I'm sorry to
disturb you Ryoko.  I just wanted to show my friend
around."  Achika felt a slight breeze as if in
response.

"Did Ryoko ever talk back to you?"  Ranko asked.

"I believe so..."

	As they left the cave, Achika caught
something from the corner of her eye.  "I'll see you
later, Ryoko," she said softly to the fleeting
image.  "Come on, I'll show you the rest of the
place."

	"Lead on then," Ranko said cheerfully.

	They continued chatting as Achika continued
her tour.  Though she had just met Ranko she felt
comfortable talking to the redhead.  It was just
easy to talk to her.  Ranko's face read like a book.
The sincerity of her expressions conveyed a feeling
of trust, which was usually reserved for close
friends.

	But despite her openness, Ranko was still a
bit of an enigma.  First of all, what would a girl
like her be doing at the shrine.  It just wasn't
something normal girls her age do.  'Heck, I'd
rather be some where else' Achika thought.  Second,
whenever the question of family came up, Ranko kept
avoiding the subject, and a hollow expression came
over her.  Not wanting to pry, any more Achika
changed the subject.

"So Ranko, what are you interested in?"

"Martial arts," She said simply.

	"Really?"  Achika said a bit surprised.  "My
father practices Kendo, and I know a little bit
myself.  What form do you study?"

"All of them," Ranko said brightly.

	At first she thought Ranko was joking, but
then she saw the look on her face.  "You're not
kidding, are you?"

	"Nope.  I've been training since I could
walk.  Pop taught me a lot of stuff, and I picked up
a few tricks along the way."  She demonstrated with
a quick kata.

	"Your very good."  Achika complimented.  Any
doubts she had were gone.  Though the kata was a
simple one, Ranko had moved with the grace and
strength of a true martial artist.  A master even,
as she compared Ranko's proficiency in the art with
her father's skill in the Masaki style of kendo.

	"What's this place?"  Ranko asked bringing
Achika out of her thoughts.

	"Huh...oh..."  Achika found herself in a
familiar area, a small lake of blue water.  At the
center was a large tree, decorated with prayer
strips.  There were stone steps leading from the
shore to the tree.

	"This is the Masaki holy tree."

	"Aaahhh!!!"  Ranko exclaimed.  An excited
look came over the girl's face.  "Is it true about
this tree being able to cure people?"

	Achika nodded her head.  "Yes, there have
been some incidents where people came here to be
healed of one thing or another.  Sometimes the
people were healed, and other times they weren't.
It's also said that you can also pray for rain to
the tree also."

"Do you...  do you know if the tree can cure
curses?"

       "I'm not sure.  But I wouldn't be surprised
if it could.  It's very special."  Then something
came to Achika's mind.  "You seem pretty interested
in the tree, Ranko.  Is that why you came here?  Do
you have something you what to have cured?"

	"I...  " Ranko shied away from her.

	"Oh, I'm sorry..."  She apologized upon 
seeing
Rankos reaction.

	"It's ok.  But it's something I'd rather not 
talk
about..."

	Achika looked concerned.  She remembered how
ill some of the visitors had been.  Coming to the
shrine had been their last chance.  A desperate
hope.

	 'What could be wrong with Ranko?  Is she
sick?  She looks so healthy.'  Achika studied the
girl.

	"Ranko, my father knows more about the
history of the tree than I do.  When he gets back
you could ask him whatever you want.  He might be
able to help you find what your looking for."

	"That would be great Achika."  The girl
instantly livened up.  "Would it be alright if I
stayed here a little while?"

	"Sure, Ranko.  Please stay as long as you
like.  I still have some chores to finish anyway.
Just follow the trail when you're finished.  It will
lead you back to the shrine."

"Thanks for the tour, Achika."

	"It was my pleasure."  Achika smiled.
Walking back, she thought more about the girl she
had met.  Ranko, a brash, fiery, cheerful young
girl.  But Achika saw a hidden sadness that the
redhead carried.  Ranko had come to the shrine
looking for something.  Achika hoped that she would
find what she was looking for.  Whatever the case,
at least she made a new friend.

Galaxy Police headquarters, the future.

	The sirens were blaring and red lights
flashed through the corridors of the expansive
complex.

	As the tech officers frantically struggled 
to find the source of the red alert, the Grand 
Marshal
entered the command room.

	"What's going on here?  What is the cause of
this?"  The lion faced Marshal asked.

	"We are tracing the source of the alarm now
sir."  One tech said.

       "It's coming through.  The source is
originating from...  oh my god..."  the man at the
terminal paled.  "Main detention block, c-central
containment.  It's a breach in the security field!"

	The Marshal's face became a mask of worry.
'No...  it can't be..."

"Sir, it's Kain!!!"

End (for now)

(1) Washu <appears from nowhere>:  Not literally the
entire world, but it would take a Herculean effort
to tolerate this situation.  <Nodoka facefaults.>
Ranma:  Please don't tell me you're another fiancee.
Washu:  Heh, heh, heh.  Of course I am, Ranma.  So
you shouldn't have a problem with giving me a
'sample'...

(2) Ryouga:  Where am I now?  Man:  You're in Hay.
Ryouga:  Why's it so hot?  Man:  'Hay, Hell, and
Booligal; the three hottest places on Earth.'
Ryouga:  Huh?  Man:  It's just a quote I heard.
Ryouga:  Booligal?  I've never been there...

Well, he has seen hell...

(3) Over *trees*!?  *Over* trees!?  Yeah well, he's
Ranma, nuff said!


Story notes:  I have been a fan of Ranma 1/2 and
Tenchi Muyo for some time now.  I have enjoyed
reading fan-fic crossovers where the two casts
interact.  But it was always the same thing, one
chaotic world collides with another to form one big
mess.  So with this little experiment, I being the
all powerful god that I am, changed the timeline
just a tad.  Ranma appears just a little bit earlier
in the Tenchi time line than he usually does.  Where
could this possible go?  I'd like to find out
myself.
