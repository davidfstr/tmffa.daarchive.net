Now, if this chapter isn't suspenseful I don't know what is.  Okay, 
maybe Mission Impossible is, but that's only cuz of Tom Cruise.  I hope 
you all paid attention to my last words of wisdom.  Here are the new 
ones:  Skateboards and cakes do not mix.  I don't own Tenchi or Sailor 
Moon.

	When Raye got to her friends' house, she was crying.  Haruka and 
Michiru said she could stay the night, but when they left the room, she 
could practically hear them thinking I told you so.  Luckily, the 
others were much more compassionate.
	"I don't get it.  I love Tenchi, but I can't be with him without 
hurting his friends.  What do I do you guys?" Raye sobbed.  Serena 
patted her back.
	"You're gonna go back there, tell him how you feel, and try and 
be friends with Ryoko and Aeka," she said.
	"Hey, have you guys seen Haruka and Michiru?" asked Setsuna, 
poking her head in the room.
	"Not since I got back.  Where would they go at this time of 
night?" Raye asked.
	"No clue.  They seemed a little upset that Aeka and Ryoko hurt 
you before," Setsuna said.
	"What?  They didn't hurt me!  I stopped them," Raye replied.  
	"Oh no.  If they think those two hurt you, they wouldn't go after 
them, would they?" asked Mina.
	"I wouldn't put it past them.  Come on!"  said Lita.

	"AHH!" Tenchi cried as the huge tidal wave came toward him.  
Kiyone pushed him out of the way and fired at Sailor Neptune.  But the 
Scout was too quick, and all that came was an earthquake summoned by 
Sailor Uranus.
	Aeka and Ryoko looked at each other.  Since they had seen Raye 
with Tenchi, there was no reason to fight over him.  But they still 
wanted to protect him.
	Aeka quickly formed a shield over Tenchi while Ryoko began 
throwing energy balls at Uranus and Neptune.  All of a sudden, someone 
cried out, "Mercury Bubbles Blast!" and a thick fog filled the area.
	"What the heck?" Tenchi cried.
	"Tenchi!" he heard Raye call.  
	"Raye?  Is that you?" he called.  Sailor Mars appeared in front 
of him.  
	"Did Uranus and Neptune hurt anyone?  Are you okay?" she said.
	"Yeah.  Who are they?" Tenchi asked.
	"Um, well, you remember Washu said my friends were from another 
planet right?  Did she say anything about the new teachers?" she asked.
	"You mean, those two are Miss Haruka and Miss Michiru?" Tenchi 
cried.  But all of a sudden, there was a loud roar.
	"What are you guys doing?" Raye cried, looking at Uranus and 
Neptune.  But they just looked back at her.  They weren't doing 
anything.  Neither were Ryoko or Aeka.  
	"Well, well.  Isn't this touching?" said a voice.  A woman 
materialized among the fighting girls.  Raye and Tenchi recognized her 
from their vision.
	Sailor Pluto gasped.  "Lady Obsidia!"
	"Very good Sailor Pluto.  But allow me to introduce my cousin 
Kagato," Obsidia laughed.  A man materialized next to her.
	"Wait, that's not Kagato!  Kagato's dead!" cried Mihoshi.
	"Do Galaxy Police officers believe in ghosts?" he said.
	"Now, we have a job to do," Obsidia said.  She pointed a shard of 
crystal at Tenchi.  A black beam shot out, but Aeka quickly jumped in 
front of him and formed a shield.
	Sailor Moon blinked.  "It was Tenchi!  Tenchi was the one you 
wanted to kill!" she exclaimed.
	"You're the smart one, aren't you?" Kagato said, before attacking 
her.  Sailor Moon screamed, just before Sailor Uranus jumped in front 
of her, sword drawn.
	"Run Sailor Moon!  You don't have Tuxedo Mask to protect you 
here!" she cried.
	"Oh no, you can't leave yet!" said Obsidia.  "The games are just 
beginning!" She shot another beam out of her crystal, which hit Sailor 
Moon.  She was paralyzed, and using the beam as a tractor beam, Obsidia 
pulled her over.
	"Jupiter Oak Evolution!" cried Sailor Jupiter, hoping to save 
Sailor Moon.  But a force field surrounded her and Obsidia.
	"Hit her crystal, it's the source of her power!" cried Washu, 
standing next to Sailor Venus.
	"Venus Love Chain Encircle!" Venus cried.  But the chain just 
bounced off of the force field.
	"Kagato!  Kill him and let's go!" cried Obsidia.  
	"What, are you afraid these little girls will beat you again?" 
Kagato said.
	"Little girl this!  Mars Flame Sniper!" yelled Sailor Mars.  The 
arrow missed Kagato just barely, and he glared at her.
	"You will pay for that!" he yelled.  Sailor Pluto was way ahead 
of him
	"Pluto Deadly Scream!" she cried.  
	"Now Kagato!" called Obsidia.  Kagato glared at Sailor Mars, then 
used a crystal similar to Obsidia's to capture Ryoko, Aeka, and Washu.
	"No!" yelled Tenchi.  But it was too late.  Kagato and Lady 
Obsidia were gone, taking Sailor Moon, Ryoko, Aeka, and Washu with 
them.
