***********************^_^********************^_^************** 
Yosho was getting a little too drunk. He stumbled out of the kitchen where  
the family was having lunch and into Washu's lab. He made his way deep into  
Washu's lab... Far, far back... Back beyond all the equipment Washu  
used... And he kept on walking for a mile or more... 
 
Meanwhile Sasami said, "Hmmm.. I wonder where he got off to..." 
 
Yosho accidentally stumbled into a little boy. "DeeDee what have I told you  
about staying out of my lab... Oh, who are you? And how did you get in  
here?" said the boy. 
"How did I get in here? What I would be asking is how did you get in here."  
said Yosho, recovering from the effects of the alcohol. 
"What do you mean? This is my laboratory and I do not know how you got in  
here but please leave and don't tell anyone this exists." said the boy, who  
spoke with a Central European accent. He was quite short and had orange  
hair. 
"I am sorry but you must be mistaken. This is Washu's lab under the  
stairs." replied Yosho. 
"Washu who? This is my lab and I built it and it is behind the bookcase not  
under the stairs!" said the boy, by now quite agitated. 
"Hmmm... Yes I see." said Yosho to himself. 
"See what?" asked the boy. 
"You have never explored the boundaries of your lab, have you?" Yosho  
questioned. 
"Well I hate to say it... But... ... ... No." replied the boy with a frown.  
"I've measured the cavern that contains it for 5 miles on every end,  
though. It seems it doesn't have an end." 
"Young child, listen carefully. Your lab is not in a cavern, but instead  
you have somehow discovered a wormhole into another dimension. This  
dimension may possibly be without end, but I, Yosho, do not know. You will  
have to ask the genius who created it, the great Washu herself, to explain it to you. 
But follow me, for  
there cannot be two labs in Washu's lab" Yosho said. 
"You mean Dexter's lab." replied the boy. 
"Yes, I guess it works that way too, if Dexter is your name." replied Yosho.  
"Either way, we must move swiftly." 
"Ok I guess I will follow you and explore the unchartered territories of my  
lab, Yosho." said Dexter in a confident voice. 
As they walked off, a girl followed them in the darkness, tiptoeing along so  
that she wouldn't be noticed... 
 
Back at the Masaki residence, Ryoko, Sasami, Ayeka, Ryo-Ohki, and Tenchi had  
decided to go swimming. Sasami was playing with Ryo-Ohki, and Ryoko was  
busy trying to get Ayeka to go skinny-dipping in front of Tenchi, who was  
already embarrassed at Ryoko for doing just that. 
"I will never set myself to as low of standards as you do, Miss Ryoko!"  
screamed Ayeka. 
"It's not like you weren't going to show them off to Tenchi anyway, now is  
it?" came back Ryoko.  
"Why you... you... ARGGHH!!" screamed Ayeka back (blushing a bit). 
"Girls, I think you should both wear your bathing suits... Please?" said  
Tenchi. 
"You stay out of it!" Both the girls screamed at Tenchi. 
All of a sudden, Vegeta and Goku came flying overhead. Goku looked down and  
waved shouting, "Hello down there!" 
"Kakarot, I thought you were the one to not want people to know that you can  
fly!" said Vegeta, glancing sideways at Goku. 
"That's only near big cities." said Goku, laughing. 
Ryoko had plunged straight under the water as soon as she saw them coming.  
She reemerged as they flew away and shouted, "Hey! This is private property.  
Why don't you fly somewhere else?" Then she thought, "Fly? I thought I  
was the only person on Earth that could fly. Hmmm..." 
"Miss Ryoko, did you just get embarrassed in front of somebody?!" said  
Ayeka, laughing her head off. 
"Grrr... Just shut up you hag!" shouted Ryoko. 
Tenchi had gone off to play Marco-Polo with Sasami and Ryo-Ohki... 
 
Washu was in her lab typing on her holo-top when Yosho appeared with Dexter  
following. Dexter was commenting on all the neat equipment and wondering  
why he hadn't thought of them. Then Yosho said, "We're here! Hey Washu, I  
have someone to meet you!" 
"Aww, poo." said Washu, "I was in the middle of working on something  
important." Her holo-top disappeared. 
Yosho sneaked out of the lab as Washu and Dexter met. 
"So you think this is your lab?" questioned Washu, "Well, since I, the great Washu, 
created  this dimension, that's nearly impossible. But you seem really smart. I  
would say for you to call me something different, but, since you're smaller  
than I am..." 
"Just who do you think you are, woman, and why do you think this is your  
lab?" asked an agitated Dexter. 
"Like I said, my name is Raccoom it rhymes with doom and you will be hurting  
all too... Whoops! Sorry, wrong show!" said Washu. "Mental note: Don't  
stay up until the Midnight Run to watch DragonBall Z." she thought. 
"Anyway my name is Washu and I am the greatest genius in  the universe!" 
"Yes! Washu is the greatest," said a doll that looked like a miniature  
version of Washu that was marked "A." 
"Yes! She is the best," said an identical doll marked "B." 
"The greatest genius in the universe? I am the greatest boy genius in the  
universe!" said Dexter. "I challenge you to a battle of the minds.  
Whomever wins gets the title Greatest Genius in the Universe!" 
"I accept your challenge, but I hope you're ready to lose!" said Washu. 
As they began cranking out cures for incurable diseases, methods of time  
travel and dimensional destabilization, mathematical facts about black  
holes, proving improvable postulates, and doing other scientific stuff, the  
girl walked up to a big tank that had a lot of small brown creatures in it.  
"Sea monkeys!" she said. Then she noticed a large red button with the  
label "Do Not Push!" "Eeeewwww, what does this button do?" she said.   
Dexter noticed and said, "Nooo!!! DeeDee don't push that button!" 
But it was too late the tank exploded! 
Washu looked and then exclaimed in a frightfully angry voice, "Nooo! You've  
freed the masses!" 
 
Ryo-Ohki sniffed the air. "Meow!" she said and then ran off toward the  
house. 
"Ryo-Ohki where are you going?" shouted Sasami after her. She was helping  
Tenchi weed the carrot patch after they were done swimming. 
"Ah, she must've smelled a carrot." said Tenchi, wiping his sweaty brow.  
"Although I'm thirsty. Let's take a break and go get a drink," he said to  
Sasami. 
"Sure let's go!" Sasami replied. 
 
Meanwhile back at Dexter's end of the lab Mandark was looking for something.  
"Ha ha ha. You are such a fool Dexter. You have left your lab open for  
me to find the neurotomic protocore! Ha ha ha." But the neurotomic  
protocore was nowhere to be found (In fact, Dexter had destroyed it after a  
previous time-traveling adventure that had made him quite ill.) "Darn you    
Dexter, I will get you for this. Mark my words, I will always try to steal  
your best inventions for my own prosperity! I swear it!" he yelled,  
shaking his fist into the air. Then he heard a commotion from a long way  
off. "So that's where you are. I wonder what you are up to..." Mandark  
snuck off toward Washu's end of the lab... 
 
Sasami and Tenchi were back at the house enjoying some lemonade that Sasami  
had made that morning. 
"Looks like Ryoko and Ayeka aren't doing their chores again," laughed  
Tenchi, glancing at the two girls asleep at opposite sides of the couch in  
front of the TV, which was turned to a talk show. 
"Yeah, I guess I'll have to do them again," sighed Sasami. 
"Don't worry, I'll help you. You're such a big help in the carrot patch  
it's the least I could do," said Tenchi. 
"Oh thank you thank you thank you so much!" said Sasami, giving a shocked  
Tenchi a huge hug. "I knew I could count on you!" 
"No, really Sasami, it's no problem!" said Tenchi,  
with a large sweatdrop on the back of his head. 
 
Washu ran out of her lab and screamed, "Everyone get down here, quick!"  
Then she ran back in. 
 
With everyone assembled in the lab, Washu stated the bad news. "Yes, once  
again the masses are free. Ryo-Ohki is not in control of them this time.  
Instead this is." She turned around a chair at the back of the room.  
DeeDee was bound and gagged in it. She had many electrodes attached at  
various places on her body, and a large metal helmet on her head. "This is  
DeeDee. She freed the masses, so they only obey her. Yet she refuses to  
talk." 
"Nope, I'm not going to say a word because you're only a friend of my  
brother Dorkster." DeeDee said. Dexter fumed. 
Mihoshi had fallen asleep. Washu noticed as Kiyone tried to wake her.  
"Mihoshi and Kiyone!" she snapped. 
"Yes?" Mihoshi and Kiyone said in unison. 
"You will stand with these books balanced on your heads so that you will  
stay awake!" she said. 
Ryoko snickered. 
 
Unknown to the group, Mandark was listening to every word from the shadows.  
"So," he thought, "my arch rival's beautiful sister has freed a creature  
that I thought couldn't exist. Ha ha ha ha ha. I will find these creatures  
once they fuse and bind them to my control. Ha ha ha." 
Then Mandark looked behind him. He thought he had heard something move by.  
Then he saw what appeared to be DeeDee's shadow. "DeeDee..." he  
unconsciously said aloud... 
 
"Now we all remember how dangerous the masses can be, right?" asked Washu.  
"These new ones that I bred are hybrid, so they are even more dangerous." 
"So you mean this time they could actually kill me?" asked Ryoko  
sarcastically. 
"This is nothing to be joking about Ryoko. Last time you were lucky. This  
time you haven't a chance." Washu replied. 
Ayeka snickered. 
 
The masses had noticed Mandark. They had taken the form of DeeDee and were  
slowly raising their arm at him... 
 
"Now we must probe DeeDee's mind since she will  
not talk." said Washu. 
"No Washu you mustn't!" said Sasami. "Not without her permission!" 
"I'm sorry Sasami but I must. This is too dangerous to just let go."  
replied Washu. 
 
Mandark was staring straight at the shadow as a light began to glow on the  
masses fingertip... 
 
Washu turned on the mind-probing device. Multi-colored lights raced around  
the helmet on DeeDee's head. Many pictures of ponies and of Dexter's end of  
the lab appeared on the screen. Washu said, "Bingo!" as one picture became  
clear on the screen. It was a picture of Mandark. 
"Mandark! What does she want with him?" asked Dexter. 
"It's quite simple really," said Washu. "She wants to kill him." 
The entire group except Washu facevaulted. Kiyone and Mihoshi sent the  
books flying. DeeDee's face filled with rage. 
 
This had distracted the masses for a second. Mandark snapped out of his  
phase, realized what was going on, and then ran out into the main section of  
Washu's side of the lab as everybody  
was just standing up. "Oh no, save me, save me!" he yelled. 
"What are you doing here, Mandark?" yelled Dexter. 
"This is fantastic! Now let us recapture the masses!" Washu yelled out as  
she handed everybody something that looked like a butterfly net. 
"Uh, Miss Washu, pardon me for asking, but how are we supposed to capture  
the masses with these?" asked Ayeka. 
"It's quite simple really. Just stick the net over the masses head! I am a  
genius!" replied Washu. 
They all facevaulted again, except Washu, who had a large sweatdrop appear  
on the back of her head. 
Mandark quickly jumped aside as a white beam of light shot through the room.  
Suddenly Dexter netted the masses. 
"I wanted to apprehend the masses!" whined Mihoshi, with two streams of  
tears running down her face. 
 
After another half an hour, the masses were back in their tank. Mandark was  
strapped to one of Washu's testing tables, and DeeDee was free. 
"I have to admit you are a pretty good scientist, Washu!"  
said Dexter. 
"Yes and you're not too bad yourself. Maybe we could help each other out."  
said Washu. 
"I think I'll install a teleporter from your side of the lab to my side."  
said Dexter. 
Washu glanced at DeeDee. "Do you think you could keep her out of it?" 
"I'm not quite sure. Well I have to go, it is already past my bedtime and  
all... Have fun with Mandark!" exclaimed Dexter as he stepped into the  
newly made teleporter. 
"Yes... Mandark..." said Washu to herself as she turned to the table.  
Then she began to laugh a maniacal laugh.
