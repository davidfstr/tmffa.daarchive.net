Part 1: No Need for Cornholio or "This Sucks"

Highland- Toilet City of America
1:32 P.M EST
Date: May 29, 1998
Site: Highland High School

        The principal was in his usual panic, with his sudden
stammering in his talking, and weakness in his voice. Beavis and
Butthead were in his office AGAIN. This time, it was for a unnatural
incident.
        The school cafeteris that day was serving something called 
Chocolete Surprise. And the name says it all. Beavis had one of those
and went bonkers. His blue Metallica shirt went over his head, hands
into the air, and the great one spoke.
        "I AM CORNHOLIO" he shouted in front of his fellow classmates. 
"I AM FROM LAKE TITICACA!" His classmates stared at him for a good 2
minutes .
 "WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?" asked the Grand Cornholio.
 "ARE YOU THREATING ME? YOU DO NOT THREATEN ME! UNLESS YOU HAVE TP FOR
MY
 BUNGHOLE, I WILL MAKE YOUR BLOOD FLOW WITH THE NONBEILIVERS!!" At the
same time this was happening, a ever stupid Butthead was on
the other side of the room, talking to some girl.
        "Hey...baby. Huhuhuh..." He said in his seducing, yet lame,
tone of
 voice. The girl slapped him on his face and left the table. Still
startled,
 he walked over to where Beavis was  doing his annoucement.
        "YOU WILL GIVE ME TP FOR MY BUNGHOOOLLLLEEE!!" shouted Beavis.
The 
Coach, just entering the cafeteria at this point, saw what the
stupidest
 high schoolers that ever lived were doing. Without noticed, he
grabbed them
 by the necks and 'carried' them to the office.
        And thats where they were at that moment in time. The
Principal's stammering got worse
as the conversation was near it's end.
        "I..uhh... Think you boys..uhh.. should be teached a lesson"
stammered 
the Principal. The coach, usually staying there so he can kick their
asses, 
left already so he could teach health. 
        "Uhh... We won't do it again" said Butthead.
        "Hehehe... you said 'it'" said Beavis, starting to laugh.
Butthead
 chimed in with his own laughter.
        "It" Butthead said again.
        "Now... I'm gonna teach you boys a lesson" said the Principal.
He
 turned and looked about, to see if anyone was listening. "We have a
few 
students going to Japan for a  week to study there culture."
        "Uhh.. We don't want to go there" said Butthead.
        "WELL YOU ARE" stammered the principal. He grabbed two tickets
out
 of his desk and handed them to the boys. "You boys plane will be
leaving tomarrow" he said. 
"I'll come by and pick you up"
        "Butthead?" asked Beavis.
        "Uhh.. Yeah" replied Butthead.
        "Does this suck?" he asked.
        "Very Much" said Butthead. "More than anything that has ever
sucked
 before."
        "Yeah..." said Beavis. 
        "Now....GO HOME!" stammered the Principal. "I'll see you
tomorrow." and as almost as
they came, they left. Principal Mccvicker struck into laughter.
        "Ha. They'll never survive a day there. Then I'll be free of
those 
bastards...haha!" yelled Mccvicker.

May 30, 1998
8:00 A.M
        Beavis and Butthead were asleep on the couch, dreaming of....
well, you know. And outside, Principal Mccvicker was waiting. He
wouldn't do this usually, but to get rid of the two most hated
students in school, he would. How in hell *DID* they get to high
school anyway. As these random thoughts came into his head, he honked
the horn to announce he was here. The woke them up.
        "What the hell?" said Beavis, getting up and scratching his
eyes. He went to the door and saw hes worst nightmare
        "AHHHH!!" he yelled. "Our Principal is HERE!!" Butthead, now
fully woken up, went to the door as well.
        "Damnit, Beavis" shouted Butthead. "I was having a good
dream." He then saw what was out there. "AH!"
        "Come on, you bungholes!" Yelled Mccvicker. He was getting
impatient with the way this was going.
        "Oh yeah, I just remembered something" said Butthead.
        "What?" asked Beavis.
        "He gave us those paper pieces and told us to come with
him...or something."
        "Oh yeah." Beavis went to the couch and got the two tickets,
covered with dirt and soda and other assorted products. They quickly
walked out and saw Mccviker
        "Move it! We don't have time" yelled the principal.
        "Uhh....No?" said Beavis, laughing. They got into the car and
were on their way.
        "Hey Butthead?" said Beavis, in the car.
        "Yeah?" he asked.
        "Hehehe... Pull my Finger." Beavis said.
        "Uhh... Ok" Butthead said. He pulled it and guess
what...Beavis farted! Who couldn't see that coming a mile away?
        "STOP IT!" yelled Mccviker. "There will be no talking in this
car anymore!"
        Beavis and Butthead were quiet for a while, but then something
triggered Beavis' Mind.
        "He said 'any'" Beavis remarked, causing Mccvicker to get very
frustrated.
        "Oh yeah..." Butthead said, laughing.
        "This is going to be a longggg trip" thought Mccviker.

Meanwhile in Okayama, Japan.
        "Hurry up, People!" Shouted Tenchi. "We only got less than a
day till they arrive."
        The whole gang was helping out the best way to try to greet
their new guest. Mihoshi and Kiyone were helping by cleaning the
house. Washu was making a Subspace room, and Sasami was cleaning the
kitchen. And Aeka and Ryoko were doing what they did best....FIGHT.
        "I tell you, Ryoko. This house needs a WOMAN's touch, not some
sick demons" yelled Aeka.
        "Well, your not doing a good job of *that*, Aeka" replied
Ryoko.
        "Why I outta.." said Aeka, but was interupted by Tenchi
walking between them.
        "Gals, Gals...please stop" said Tenchi. He then called out
"Everyone! come here!" Everyone stopped what they were doing and
huddled up near Tenchi.
        "Now listen, when these two boys get here, We are all brothers
and sisters, excluding father and grandfather. So that means no
seducing from you two" he said as he pointed to Ryoko and Aeka.
        "What? What?" they said, almost in unision.
        "And we gotta keep it that they don't know anything. K?"
        "Right" they all said and went back to work.
        "So I guess I can't show them my self portrait then.. Kiyone?"
Mihoshi asked.
        "No...especialy the one on the badge." said Kiyone.
        "I would never do that! It's my job as a Galaxy Police
Detective to keep undercover when we have to...under Paragraph 5. 45 A
anyway."
        "Ok... just don't mention that to those kids."
        "Ok."
        This would be a loooonng week
