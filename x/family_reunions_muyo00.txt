No Need For Family Reunions!
by Chibi-Ryoko Habuki

Authors Note: My first attemp at a fan fiction. This story was something I thaught 
up while working on another SailorMoon/Tenchi Muyo! X-over. It just came to me 
after a while and I laughed at it, and soon forgot about it. But the story kept coming 
back every time I read my Seera-Muu SuperS novel, so here it is!
*	*	*	*	*	*	*	
Who is the mother of the three Godesses? And why is Washu's hair pink? What 
Became of Chibi Usagi? Or Chibi Chibi? Who does Ryoko get her hair from? Where 
did Ryoko's gems come from? ALL THIS AND NORE SHALL BE ANSWERED!!
*	*	*	*	*	*	*

Heres a family tree for Ryoko, based on this fan fiction
