The Juari Witch Project: Part 2
 
 
     Later, after the interview, they were walking towards somewhere that
they don't know.
 
Ayeka: Do any of you guys have the map?
 
Tenchi and Francisco start singing
 
Tenchi and Francisco:(singing) You must know something. Even though you
have nothing. Get that f**king camera out of my face you annoying pig.
 
Later...
 
Ayeka: Where are we?
Francisco: We're lost. OK.
 
Later they found an abandoned house.
 
Ayeka: This must be it. Who's got the map?
 
Francisco starts laughing.
 
Francisco: You know what. There's nothing in the star map about the Juari
Witch. so forget about the map. Shut up about the map.
 
Tenchi: How did you know? We didn't look at it. Just give us the map.
Francisco: You know what did with the map? I kicked in the moat. OK.
Ayeka and Tenchi: WHAT?
Francisco: What?
Ayeka: YOU THREW AWAY THE MAP?
Francisco: It was f**king stupid, Ayeka. I want to go home.
Tenchi: Give me the map.
Francisco: No, f**k you. I don't have the map.
 
Tenchi punches Francisco.
 
Tenchi: Throw me the map and I throw you the whip.
Francisco: I want my mom.
Ayeka: But it's not going to happen now. Is it?
 
They continued to argue forever until night fall, they set up camp. During
the night, Tenchi heard a noise.
 
Tenchi: What's that noise?
 
Turns on the flash light and sees Francisco on top of Ayeka kissing.
 
Tenchi: Oh my god. You guys are gross.
 
Tenchi gets out of the tent and runs out of sight. Francisco and Ayeka went
right after him. Francisco ran faster and spotted a house. Ayeka went
downstairs and saw Francisco standing in a corner. She screams.
 
Franciso: Can't I take a leak?
 
Tenchi appears.
 
Tenchi: How about a little privacy. Dude.
 
The end.
