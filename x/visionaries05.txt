CHAPTER 5

    It had been a relatively peaceful two weeks since the fight with Ayeka 
ended. She and Sasami had settled into the house, with Ayeka profusely 
apologizing to them for her actions (well, apologizing to all except Ryoko). 
While Sasami had started helping out in the kitchen.

"So you're a cook, Sasami?" Asked Ukyo.

"Oh yes."

"Would you like to help me with supper tonight?"

"Sure."

"You know, I'm a pretty good chef myself." Ukyo said proudly. "You're looking 
at the greatest okonomiyaki chef in Japan."

"Okonomiyaki?" Sasami asked.

"I'll make some for you later. Trust me, you'll love it."

"Okay."

*************

    Of course, the feud between Ayeka and Ryoko continued on, with the two of 
them almost coming to blows several times a day, with either Tenchi or Ranma 
having to break them apart.

"What is it with you two, anyway?" Tenchi asked Ryoko. Both of them where out 
on the newly repaired deck.

"I know Ayeka from way back, Tenchi, she's the most stuck-up woman in the 
galaxy!"

"But do you two have to fight everyday!?"

"You don't understand Tenchi." Ryoko said with a shake of her head. 

*************

    For some reason, Genma had been spending a lot of time up in his room, 
alone. Even now he sits in the middle of the floor, thinking.

'I didn't expect to encounter the Jurai royal family again so soon! So that's 
Ayeka. I didn't expect her to show up so soon, if at all! Eventually her 
parents are going to realize I've returned to this household, and I'll have a 
lot of explaining to do, to them...and my son.'

*************

    Tenchi was still unsure about what was going on here. Even now he sat on 
his bed, looking over the sword his grandfather had given him. Tenchi-ken. He 
looked at the blue blade, and the two gems in the hilt. Why did his 
grandfather want him to have this? How did it work? It was like something out 
of Star Wars. But Tenchi knew he was no Luke Skywalker. He'd have to sit down 
and talk, really talk, with his grandfather later.

*************


    Ranma has spent more and more time up at the shrine with Katsuhito. One 
of Ranma's goals is to someday gain the skill to defeat his grandfather. 
While it hasn't happened yet, Ranma looks forward to the day.

"Ranma...now." Ranma got up from the spot where he was crouched on the 
ground, and ran at the old man. He somersaulted into the air and landed 
behind him. Katsuhito turned and blocked the young man's kick with his 
bokken. Ranma back-flipped away, hoping to make some room between them, he'd 
never win in close quarters. He considered throwing his chi attack again, 
but, his grandfather was too fast for that. Ranma was still thinking of what 
to do next when his grandfather appeared in front of him. Ranma barely had 
time to block the bokken. He grimaced, and reminded, himself to stay focused.

*************

"This isn't Yokohama." Said a young man, walking down the streets of what 
appeared to be Okinawa. He was medium height, had a yellow shirt, and black 
pants, along with a yellow headband. He had a back-pack on, with a bamboo 
umbrella tied to it's top. He walked aimlessly down the street, looking at a 
map in his hand.

"Excuse me?" He asked a person." Do you know the way to Yokohama." The person 
looked at the map and gave him some directions. "Thanks."

    This boy has traveled the world for the last few years, his thoughts 
those of revenge. His journey's long, and rife with suffering.

"Soon Ranma, I'll find you, and vengeance shall be mine!!"

*************

Tenchi, Ranma, Ryoko, Ukyo, Ayeka and Sasami sat in the living room, their 
chores done. Now most of them where left with nothing to do.

"Hey guys?" Asked Ukyo. "You guys want to go out?"

"Where to Ucchan?"

"I don't know, into Yokohama? Maybe do some shopping?"

"Sure!" Said Sasami. Sasami had wanted to see more of Yokohama since she got 
here. 

"I got nothing else to do." Ryoko piped in. Tenchi and Ranma both had 
slightly deflated looks at the thought of going shopping with the girls, each 
knowing what girls got like when they where shopping. Images of them both 
carting around arm-loads of clothes entered their minds. However they both 
seemed to be outvoted in this matter.

"Come on guys." Said Ukyo.

"Why don't you girls go ahead." Ranma said. "You don't really need us."

"You want us helpless woman to go into town undefended?" Said Ryoko with a 
sly smile.

"You're hardly helpless, Ryoko." Said Tenchi, the pirate just smiled again.

"We need you two for this." Said Ukyo.

"Why? To cart around the bags?" Ukyo grabbed Ranma's wrist, dragging him to 
his feet, Ryoko doing the same to Tenchi.

"Yes."

*************

"This isn't Yokohama." The young man stood outside Tokyo Tower, map still in 
hand. Why did this always happen to him. "After all the years of following 
him and dreaming of revenge, he manages to give me the slip." He said to no 
one in particular.

"Excuse me, sir?" The boy once again asked for directions, and was pointed in 
the right direction. "Thank you."

    The boy once again set out, dreaming of his revenge.

"You're mine Ranma, vengeance will be mine!"

*************

"Hhmm...Would I look good in this?" Sasami held a dress up against herself 
for Ukyo to consider. The Okonomiyaki chef looked at the dress, which dwarfed 
the girl holding it.

"Well, it seems a bit big for you Sasami." In all honesty, this isn't the 
type of shopping Ukyo has wanted, at least not dress shopping. She hadn't 
worn a girl's outfit since she was six. Ukyo had always been most comfortable 
in boy's attire, and it showed in her clothing closet. She looked over at 
Ayeka, and Ryoko. Ryoko was checking herself out in a barely there black 
evening gown. While everything Ayeka tried only would show bare skin above 
her neck.

"So tell me Tenchi. How do I look?" Ryoko grinned and showed off in front of 
Tenchi, who was sitting in a chair next to Ranma. Ukyo imagined herself in 
the gown and the look she would get from Ranchan for it. Tenchi looked 
embarrassed by the scene, but managed to squeak out a "wonderful." Ryoko 
smiled and went to pay for the dress.

"Tenchi, if you keep talking like that, we'll never get rid of that woman." 
Ranma said discreetly. It was true that Ranma and Ryoko weren't exactly 
getting along, with Ranma praying that she would leave. Ukyo thought he had a 
problem with the pirates uninhibited nature. Her mind went back to their 
encounter with a similar uninhibited person in China. Ukyo shook her head in 
disgust at the memory, and wondered if that was the reason Ranma acted like 
this around her.

"Hey girls." Ranma said. "Do you mind if we look around for a bit?"

"Well, I suppose we'll be in here for awhile." Said Ayeka. "Go ahead, we'll 
meet you later."

"I'll come along." Ukyo said. "I'm not overly comfortable in a dress shop 
anyway."

"Oh...sure Ucchan." The three of them left the shop, entering into the main 
section of the mall, in indoor strip revealing hundreds of different shops.

"Well boys, where shall we go first?"

*************

"Is this it?" The boy looked up from his map, and a smile entered his face. 
He was finally in Yokohama! He would have his vengeance. He looked up at the 
sing, and it said "welcome to Yokohama." He leapt for joy, and began to run, 
out of town. After a mile, he stopped and realized that the buildings where 
gone.

*************

"Ukyo?"

"Yeah Tenchi?"

"You never did tell me how you came to be traveling with Ranma." Tenchi asked.

"You mind if I tell him, Ranchan?"

"Go ahead."

"Okay, well it started when we were six...."

*************

    When we were six, Ranma would always come to me and my father's Yatai to 
fight me. If he won, he would get okonmiyaki for free. Sometimes he won, 
sometimes I won. Eventually our fathers saw us playing and a thought came to 
my father's mind.

"Look at them Genma."

"Yes, they get along very well."

"I have been looking for a possible husband for my daughter for along time. 
She needs someone strong, who can handle the responsibilities of being a 
hsuband."

"And you're suggesting....?"

"Why do we not engage your son and my daughter?"

"I...I don't know."

"Come now! I even offer a dowry for the engagement."

"A dowry?"

"Yes. My Yatai."

"Your Yatai?" Genma turned to the cart, his interest piqued. Traveling around 
China was hungry work, and that Yatai would be a great help.

"Think of it."

"Hhmm....Very well. They are engaged." The two fathers shook hands. Genma 
looked over at the two children, wrestling on the ground. It was tough enough 
with just Ranma, Ukyo going with them would only make things harder. Later 
that day he went up to his son.

"Ranma."

"Yeah pops?"

"I have a question for you. What do you like more? Ukyo or Okonmiyaki?" 
Ranma's forehead scrunched as he thought.

"Okonomiyaki." Genma smiled.

"All right then. Come, it's time for us to continue our journey."

*************

"They left with the Yatai, leaving me alone." Tenchi looked shocked as he 
turned to his cousin. Ranma's face grew guilty looking, and he turned away. 
"I went after them on my own. For awhile I was certain that I would never 
find them, but about three months later, I found them. They had been staying 
at a martial arts dojo in Beijing. It was pure luck that we were both there 
at the same time. I found them and beat the hell out of Genma. It turned out 
they had already destroyed the yatai in an accident. Since Ranchan and me 
were still engaged I went along. I've been with them ever since."

"Let's not forget how you treated pops for the next few weeks after that. 
Let's just say a day didn't go by where pops didn't need an ice-pack." Ranma 
said. Both of them laughed at that. "When pops asked me that question, I 
really thought it was a joke. It sounded like it at the time. I didn't even 
know that Ukyo was a girl."

"How could you not tell?" Tenchi asked.

"Well, Ukyo was never the feminine dresser."

"What's the meaning of that?" Ukyo asked.

"Nothing." Ranma said nervously. Ukyo gave him a look that he backed away 
from, before turning back to Tenchi. "We had quite the time in China, you 
wouldn't believe some of the people we met. Ranma got a whole load of stuff 
from the Amazon tribe there."

"Amazons? In China? I thought they were from Greece?"

"These are different Amazons. We had a very unusual time at their village." 
Said Ukyo.

"They had this princess there who I had to fight."

"I thought it was dishonorable to fight a girl?" 

"I was a girl at the time, and she challenged me. I went easy on her, though. 
She wasn't really that hurt. But after the fight she kissed me for some 
reason." Ukyo's face turned red, and steam rose off her body as Ranma talked 
about this. She remembered that. Who was that hussy to just go up and kiss 
her Ranchan!? And in his girl form at that!

"That wasn't all we did, thought." Ranma said, cutting off her thoughts. We 
did go to school a few times. Met some interesting people there.

"But Ranma kept getting into duels with people." Said Ukyo, with a sigh. 
"Some of them even followed us around, trying to take vengeance on Ranma." 
Ukyo giggled.

"Let me tell you about some. One of them was the real stupid kid called...."

*************

"Okay, I am in Yokohama." The boy stood in the middle of Yokohama, certain 
that he would not get lost this time. He would finally have his vengeance. 
Now all he had to do was find Ranma. He reached into his pack and found a 
picture of the boy in question.

"Now to ask around." The boy started to speak with various people, showing 
them the picture, and asking if they had seen him. After three hours he began 
to get disheartened. He knew Ranma said his home was in Yokohama, he had to 
be here! The boy looked around and wondered where he had wound up, after all 
the questioning.

"A mall?" Well he was hungry, anyway. He saw a nice restaurant and went to 
get something to eat. He couldn't face Ranma on an empty stomach. He ordered 
some ramen and sat down. Been along time since he'd had the chance to sit 
down in a restaurant and eat. He had spent many years preparing for the 
fight, learning moves, and upping his strength in China. He had already 
planned out a way to fight Ranma, which he thought would lead him to victory. 
He was so into the thought that he almost missed hearing some familiar voices 
talking, a few feet away from him.

"But Ranma kept getting into duels with people, some of them even followed us 
around, trying to take vengeance on Ranma." That voice. It was incredibly 
familiar. Wasn't Ranma carting around some woman with him? That was her voice.

"Let me tell you about some. One of them was this real stupid kid called...." 
That was Ranma's voice! He leapt from his chair, flipping in the air and 
landing in the front of the small café.

"Ranma Saotome! I've finally found you!"

"Ryoga Hibiki!!!" Ranma said in shock. The boy called Ryoga pulled the bamboo 
umbrella from his pack, and flung it towards the stunned young man. It 
collided with him, and knocked him back into the wall.

"Ranchan!?" Ukyo said, turning to Ryoga. Wishing she brought her battle 
spatula, Ukyo jumped at him anyway. Ryoga moved to the side swiftly, as her 
kick missed.

"This has nothing to do with you, woman. I do not want to have to hurt you."

"You hurt my Ranchan! You'll pay for that!" Ukyo charged at him again. But an 
arm came up to block her. She stopped and saw Ranma standing in front of her.

"No Ukyo. This my fight, you and Tenchi stay back."

"But..."

"Please." Ukyo looked apprehensive for a moment, but eventually did as she 
was told, herding Tenchi back with her. All other people in the mall were 
already running away from the scene.

"Hello Ryoga. It's been a long time."

"Silence Ranma. You must pay for the sufferings you have caused me!"

"Sufferings!? I don't know what you're talking about. By the way, where were 
you the day of our duel? I waited three days for you."

"I...got lost. But I got their only four days late."

"Oh right, the Hibiki family directional curse. I remember hearing about 
that." Ranma said, with a cocky grin. "You finally learn to get to the 
bathroom without ending up on the other side of the world?"

"Enough talk! DIE!!!" Ryoga rammed himself at Ranma, and hitting him full 
force. Ranma was sent flying back again, but flipped in the air, and landed 
on his feet. Sheesh! Since when was Ryoga this strong? That felt like a 
freight train hitting him. Ranma rammed back at him, and jumping into a 
twirling kick in the air. It connected with his opponent's face, but he was 
un-affected. 

"Now, what's this horrible suffering you're talking about?"

"No, you won't distract me by talking, Ranma. You will pay!!!" Ryoga flung 
several benches at Ranma, who had to move quickly to dodge them. More and 
more big, flying objects went flying at him.

"After all this time, after all the pain and sorrow, vengeance will be mine!"

"Is that all you can say?"

"Jeez, Ukyo. How strong is that guy?"

"He wasn't this strong the last time we saw him! He's been working out." Ukyo 
watched in slight horror, as Ryoga uprooted a stone column from the mall 
floor, and swung it like a baseball bat at Ranma. Ranma leapt over it, and 
flung himself at Ryoga, kicking him in the face. Ranma followed it up with a 
barrage of punches and kicks, hoping to knock out his enemy. Ranma hit the 
chestnut fist, and Ryoga was starting to look wary. Suddenly he leapt into 
the air, and landed behind Ranma.

"I won't lose, I have traveled to far to lose!" Ranma ran at him again. Ryoga 
caught him with a spinning kick to the head. He ran to his umbrella and flung 
it again, whacking Ranma on the side of the head. Ryoga was a blur as he 
attacked Ranma, hundreds of punches and kicks ladned on the young man. Ranma 
finally fell to his knees. Ryoga walked up to him. Ranma swept his legs out 
from under him, his trick working. Ranma jumped up to make some room between 
them, and his chi started to flair around him.

"Fierce Tiger Domineering blast!" The chi blast slammed from his hands, and 
connected with Ryoga. Ryoga was sent to the ground, but was back on his feet 
and charging again. Ranma was caught by surprise, figuring the blast would 
end it. Ryoga's fists where incredibly powerful, as they slammed into him. 
Ryoga's spinning kick sent Ranma flying back. He suddenly began to charge 
again.

"This ends now!" Ryoga suddenly stuck his finger forward, and was directing 
it toward Ranma. Ranma moved, as the finger collided with the wall behind 
him, shattering it immediately.

"Where'd you learn that?" Ranma asked.

"None of your business!" Ryoga had the pillar again, and was swinging it. It 
hit Ranma again, and knocked him to the floor. Ryoga brought the pillar up 
above his head, as he brought it down, a blur slammed through it, shattering 
it. The stone pieces showered down around the young man, as he saw a woman 
floating in the air in front of him.

"My, my. Trying to kill him? Despite my feelings toward him, I'm afraid I 
can't allow that.' Ryoko said.

"Aside. This is not your matter."

"This very much my matter. You see those two over there?" She pointed to Ukyo 
and Tenchi. "Those are friends of mine. You could have hurt them. I don't 
enjoy people attacking my friends."

"Ryoko! Are you responsible for this?" Came a high shrill voice. Ayeka ran to 
the scene, towing Sasami behind her.

"No way Ayeka! It's all this guys fault. I intend on making him pay for it."

"I will not fight a woman. It is dishonorable." Said Ryoga.

"Too bad." Ryoko struck like lightning, as her energy bolt slammed into him. 
Ryoga was knocked head over heels, and landed hard. Ryoko flew into the air, 
and came down fist first at the young man, knocking him back to the ground. 
Ryoko picked him up by the chin, sending two punches into his stomach. Ryoga 
was strong, but his strength was nothing compared to Ryoko's. Ryoko wound up, 
and sent an uppercut into him. Ryoga went flying through the ceiling, and 
into the sky.

"And don't come back!" She yelled after him.

"(Groan). What happened?" Ranma asked as he crawled to his feet.

"I just saved your ass, kid." Said Ryoko.

"What! You interfered in my fight!? You can't do that?"

"He was going to kill you Ranma!" Said Tenchi.

"Be thankful that guy doesn't fight woman, or it may have been much more 
difficult for me to get rid of him." Said Ryoko. "Not that I couldn't have, 
anyway."

"Um guys. I think we should get out of here." Tenchi said. "Police are going 
to be here, soon."

"Hhmm? Oh sure, Tenchi." Ryoko concentrated, and all of them disappeared.

*************

"AAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!" Ryoga Hibiki flew through the air, cursing 
that woman who did this to him. How dare she come between him and his 
rightful vengeance. He wondered just where he was going to land. He finally 
saw what looked like a wooden dojo roof. That was all he saw as he crashed 
through it. Just before unconsciousness came over him he saw a young girl in 
a yellow gi running up to him.

"Dad! Come quick! Someone fell through the roof!" This was all he heard, as 
Ryoga fell into the bliss of unconsciousness. 

*************

"Hhmm. He sounds like a very strong boy." Katsuhito sat before his charges, 
everyone but Ryoko, sitting on the floor in front of him. "Why would he want 
to attack you Ranma?"

"I don't know gramps. I knew Ryoga from one of the high schools we went to on 
our journey. Every day in the lunchroom, there would be a rush for the bread, 
with me usually getting the last piece. Ryoga always went without bread, and 
he eventually he started getting angry about it. He challenegd me to a duel 
then. It was to take place behind his home in an alley. I came there and 
waited, I waited for three days, and he never showed up. So I finally left. 
This is the first time I've seen him in years."

"Interesting." Katushito rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a few moments, his 
gaze drifting off to infinity. "According to what I heard, he took you down, 
Ranma, even though Ryoko's intervention makes the fight a draw, you will have 
to do better that that. Especially if he returns. Tenchi I want you to start 
carrying Tenchi-ken with you at all times, as well. Especially if such a 
fight becomes a danger to you or others." Both boys nodded. "You are all 
dismissed."

The group left the shrine then.

"Do you think this Ryoga guy'll come back?" Tenchi asked.

"He did strike me as the obsessive type. We might see him again."

"Of course, there is the famous Hibiki family directional curse."

"The what?"

"A small problem our boy has." Ranma said. "He has the worst sense of 
direction in the entire world. It'll be forever before he actually finds his 
way back here."

"That's not really reassuring." Tenchi said. "You saw how strong he is."

"Yeah. He's obviously been working out some since I last saw him." Ranma 
said. "Don't worry about it, I know what to expect from him now."

Tenchi hoped his cousin was right. He could imagine what a fight like that 
could do to their home. It had taken them long enough to repair it from the 
attack of Ayeka. Ryoga seemed even more dangerous, and without a space-ship! 
Who else from Ranma's past was going to show up looking for him?

TO BE CONTINUED.

NEXT CHAPTER: CHAOS IS SPELLED S.H.A.M.P.O.O.
