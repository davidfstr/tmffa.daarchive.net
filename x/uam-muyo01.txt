Ultima Anime Massacre Muyo Chapter #1
By Ultima_Trev, the creator of Massacre In Tokyo.
-------------------------------------------------

Legend: "quotation marks" = Outloud speech, *stars* = thought.

Setting: The outskirts of Tokyo, after Lucifer has been killed by Ultima 3 Trev. (You'll know 
what I mean when the series is released on video)

Trev: "They're all gone. Adrian, Trell, Mako. My best friends are now dead and gone."

Trev now summons his Masamune Katana to suicide, but he hears som people flying towards him.

Son Goku: "Don't do it!!!"
Vegita: "Piss off Kackarott, let the bitch die."
Piccolo: "You'll have to excuse our little friend here, he's insane."
Trev: "Who the fuck are you guys!?"
Son Goku: "I'm Son Goku, this little guy is Prince Vegita, this green guy is the Namek Piccolo."
Trev: "Oh yeah, I remember seeing you guys on TV battling the evil Cell."
Piccolo: "Unfortunetly he has come back to life."
Vegita: "Unfortunet? Please, I have the power to kill him with ease. Check this out!!!"

Vegita goes to his SSJ4 state...

Trev: "Damn, you've got quite a low power level there."
Son Goku, Piccolo, and Vegita: "What!!!"
Son Goku: "You're kidding right!?"
Trev: "Hell no!!!"

Trev now goes to his Ultima Human 3 state...

Vegita: "No way!!!"
Piccolo: "Unreal!!!"
Son Goku: "It's obvious you have a power level that even triples mine, but it's not enough to
defeat Cell and his new found friends."
Trev: "Friends?"
Vegita: "I believe his friends names are Kagato, Sephiroth, and Hazonko."
Trev: "Where are they all now?"
Piccolo: "Some planet called Jurai."

Planet Jurai...

King Tenchi: "Everyone, Kagato is back from the dead!!!"
Queen Sasami: "Tenchi dear, can you repeat that?"
Kagato: "Hello Tenchi, I've come to get revenge on you."
Tenchi: "And who are these guys!?"
Cell: "I am a bio android and I'm more powerful then you can ever hope to be."
Hazonko: "I am the most powerful of all K Pirates."
Sephiroth: "And I am the greatest swordsman ever."
Kagato: "And we all have one mission, destroy all of our enemies."
Mysterious Male: "I wish to join you."
Hazonko: "What is that?"
Mysterious Male: "I am Lucifer, the prince of Darkness."
Tenchi: "Holy shit, Satan's real!!!"
Lucifer: "I hate the name Satan, call me Lucifer!!!"
Tenchi: "Sasami, Ryoko, Aeka, Washu, Tokimi, get in here now!!!"

Back on Earth...

Trev: "Shit, Lucifer is still alive."
Son Goku: "You mean the Prince of Darkness?"
Trev: "Afraid so."
Piccolo: "That's just great. Now we have four massive evil powers to destroy."
Vegita: "And thy're all on planet Jurai, how do you suppose we get there?"
Mysterious Male: "However you get there, be sure to take us with you."
Trev: "What the fuck!?"
Barret Wallace: "Yo Cloud, how did Sephiroth come back to life? I thought we were rid of him for
good!!!"
Tifa Lockheart: "It doesn't matter, we'll just have to kill him again."
Cloud Strife: "Tifa's right."
Son Goku: "I take it you guys are after Sephiroth."
Cloud: "Damn right. I'm Cloud, that's Tifa and Barret."
Trev: "It seems we are all after a certain evil, but they are on planet Jurai right now."

Back on Jurai...

Aeka: "Oh my."
Ryoko: "This isn't good."
Sasami: "I'm scared Tenchi!!!"
Washu: "According to my calculations, we're screwed."
Tokimi: "I think you're right."
Kagato: "Welcome to the beginning of the end!!!"
Cell: "We have quite a show for you wothless specimans."
Sephiroth: "We'll show you your doom."
Hazonko: "That we will."
Lucifer: "Then you can burn in Hell afterwards, Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!"
Mihoshi: "This is the coolest Halloween Party I've ever been to!!!"
Washu (Sweat beading): *Stupid whore Mihoshi.*
Kagato: "Are we ready to kick ass and take names!?"
Cell: "Of course."
Hazonko: "Indeed."
Sephiroth: "Absolutely."

Back on Earth...

Trev: "What the hell is that!?"
Cloud: "I dunno."
Barret: "It's huge!!!"
Son Goku: "I think it's a space ship!!!"

The red ship now lands and out comes the crew...

Gilliam: "So these are all the huge powers I sensed."
Gene Starwind: "What are their powers levels anyway?"
Aisha Clan-Clan: "Can't be as high as mine!!!"
Sazuka: "I don't know about that."
