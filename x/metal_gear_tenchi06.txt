        of people beat a platoon of armed soldiers?





            METAL GEAR: TENCHI
        Episode 6: Light Within Shadows

Scene: The Yagami; in the living room of the Masaki home before 
       sending the four into their strategic positions in the GP.

Kiyone: I can't go in...
Naomi: Why?
Kiyone: I work with the Galaxy Police.  All of their records go as 
    deep as my DNA structure.  There are specific security systems
    in the GP Station...
Tenchi: So, how come Minagi can enter?
Kiyone: Minagi Chere had just graduated the academy and is now a 
    rookie.  They haven't recorded her DNA yet.
Otacon: Could you name a few of the systems?
Kiyone: There's the DNA scanner, weapons detection, security cameras,
    thermal sensors...there's just so many, I've yet to keep count!
Snake: So much for this...(hands his SOCOM to Kiyone)
Campbell: Why aren't you going, Ryoko?
Ryoko: They know me too well...They had special permission to record
       my DNA, too.  (turns to Ayeka) Why aren't you going, as well?
Ayeka: Because I don't fight as well as they do...
Ryoko: But I thought the princess of Jurai had beauty and power!  I
       guess you lied about both!
Ayeka: YOU LITTLE...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Minagi: (looking at Tenchi) I don't suppose this is what you have to
    go THIS everyday, do you?
Tenchi: >sigh!<
Snake: I'm headin' off!
Mei Ling: Without saying good-bye?
Snake: We're all coming back...It ain't good-bye unless one of us is
       having a dirt nap!
Washu: No intention of doing that yet?
Snake: Not without kicking their asses like a bee-stung mule!
Campbell: I wish all of you the best of luck!
Naomi: (while holding Ryoko and Ayeka in a head-lock) Same here, guys!
       And don't worry about THEM saying their good-byes...no time for
       another argument!  (Ryoko and Ayeka both punch Naomi in the
       stomach as soon as the four leave the room, then the two start
       fighting each other)

Scene: The GP loading docks, Minagi's position

(The landing of the space pod grabbed the attention of the three 
guards that were positioned.  The pod appeared empty, thus starting 
the guards' investigation.  Meanwhile, Minagi guides the other three to
four express elevators.  As the three went up, Minagi finds a safe
place to hide to contact Col. Campbell.  *Note: " will indicate a
codec conversation.  >><< will indicate the frequency called.  
^ indicates a codec conversation ended.)
Minagi: >>141.12<< "This is Chere.  I'm at the loading docks."
Campbell: "How are the others?"
Minagi: "They had just taken the express elevators.  No one should
    detect them, right?"
Kiyone: "They shouldn't.  The express elevators are only used in case 
    of fire.  There isn't any monitoring of those elevators."
Campbell: "For now, just go ahead and retrieve some records in any of
      the offices that might relate as to why this is happening
      while the others take their positions." ^
(Minagi heads for the fourth express elevator for the offices in the
5th floor.)

Scene: The 16th floor armory, Nagi's position.
(Nagi gets a feel of the area and finds two guards at two different
areas away from the elevator.  She then finds a vent shaft near ground-
level and enters it.)
Nagi: >>141.12<< "Nagi here.  I'm at the 16th floor."
Naomi: "What's the situation?"
Nagi: "Two guards in the armory."
Campbell: "Probably where they get their armaments.  Take out the 
      guards and the weapons very quietly."
Nagi: "Got it.  I'm out." ^
(After the two guards obliviously pass the shaft, Nagi sneaks out to
grab a GP blaster and a supressor.  As if it weren't obvious, she shot
the two guards dead.  As for the weapons, she lets out a little smirk.
Four sniper rifles, four blasters with silencers, four automatics,
and twenty EMG (Electro-Magnetic Grenades) were kept.  Nagi contacts
Kiyone.)
Nagi: >>141.12<< "Kiyone, how do you propose I destroy these quietly?"
Kiyone: "Bag the ammunition and stuff it in the vent you were hiding
    in.  As for the guns, there's an incinerator in the loading
    docks."
Campbell: "You can call Minagi's frequency at 140.15."
Nagi: "I'll call her right away.  By the way, I'm gonna hold a few
      weapons for all four of us out here.  You mind?"
Naomi: Well, whatever works..."^
Nagi: >>140.15<< "Minagi?"
Minagi: "What is it?"
Nagi: "Is there an incinerator nearby you?"
Minagi: "About 10 floors down from where I'm at...Why?"
Nagi: "There's a few weapons that need to be destroyed..."
Minagi: "I'm on my way."^

Scene: The robotics division on the 31st floor, Tenchi's position.

(Tenchi hides behind one of the bipedal robots as a guard passes by.
Tenchi is then able to pass the guard without being noticed and enters
the next room, where there are no guards.)
Tenchi: >>141.12<< "This is Tenchi.  I'm in a room that seems 
    completely clean."
Ryoko: "TEEEEEEEEEEEEENCHI!  I'm so glad you're safe!"
Tenchi: "Ryoko?!" (hears an argument in the background)
Ryoko: "Dammit, Ayeka, I'm talking to him here!!"
Ayeka: "Lord Tenchi, are you hurt or anything?"
Campbell: "Dammit, you two!  You both are gonna break the codec!!"
Tenchi: "Uhh...Sorry about the trouble there..!"
Naomi: "Not to worry."
Mei Ling: "How's your situation?"
Tenchi: "I was in some room that has a bunch of robot suits."
Kiyone: "That's the robotic room.  Try not to move any of those suits.
    Any mistake and the grenades loaded in the robos will cause a
    major explosion, especially the way they lined up the robots!"
Tenchi: "Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the jail area around here
    somewhere?"
Mihoshi: "Yeah!  There's also a cafeteria if you want a snack, too!"
Kiyone: "There's no time for that!  Anyway, the rumor has it that there
    are prisoners that might know something.  Talk to them and see
    if they know anything for now."
Tenchi: "OK.  I'm off!"^


Scene: The forensics laboratory in the 46th floor, Snake's position

(The lab is full of corpses of scientists who were shot.  Snake looks
around for anyone who is still struggling to live, but to no avail.)
Snake: What the hell is going on here?  >>141.12<<  "This is Snake.
       Otacon, do you read me?!"
Otacon: "Yeah.  What's going on?"
Snake: "I'm at the forensics lab.  Place looks like a morgue!"
Kiyone: "My God!  Any survivors?"
Snake: "None!"
Campbell: "The poor souls..."
Snake: "These don't seem like any ordinary bullet holes...Like some big
       gun was used!"
Kiyone: "...Can't be!"
Snake: "What?!"
Ayeka: "Are there any slash marks on the bodies?"
Snake: (examining a body) "Well I'll be...!  How the...?!"
Ayeka: "Oh, no!  My father?"
Snake: "...?!"
Campbell: "Snake, for now keep searching for clues and the Chief.
      That's all we can do for now."
Snake: "Remember, all of us want full disclosure on this.  That means
       if anyone knows anything, then the four of us must know as 
       well."
Mei Ling: "Snake, you can contact the others by codec if you need 
      anything.  Minagi's is 140.15; Nagi's is 141.22; and Tenchi's
      is 140.69...."
Campbell: "Snake, get a hold of yourself!"^

(Right then and there, a nearby locker bursts open and a person is
running for the door.  Before that could happen, Snake stops the 
runner.  The runner is a beautiful 21 year old female with long 
emerald hair and indigo-blue eyes.)
Scientist: (sobbing) Please, don't hurt me!
Snake: Calm down!  I'm not here to hurt you!  C'mon already!
Scientist: (pulling herself together)  You're not?
Snake: No...
Scientist: You're not one of them, are you?
Snake: No.  Can you tell me what happened here?
Scientist:  >sniff< It was horrible!  It was a massacre!
Snake: (gently grabbing her shoulders) Shhhhhhhh...I'm here to help.
       Name's Snake...yours?
Scientist: Amy...Amy Kadowaki.
Snake: Well then, Amy...Could you tell me what happened here?
Amy: We were doing an experiment dealing with the "spirit gene" theory.
     As we were working, some terrorists came in and shot everyone
     while my fiance pushed me into that locker.
Snake: Fiance, huh?  Where's your ring?
Amy: (reaching into her pocket) Here...(shows the ring)
Snake: Hmmmm...Cubic-cut 14k diamond...Must've been expensive...
Amy: Yeah...He died protecting me...
Snake: (pats Amy's shoulder) I'm sorry to hear that...  Listen, we have
       to leave this place.  Terrorists are crawling all over the
       place, and you need protection from them.
Amy: How will you do that?
Snake: Give me a minute...Keep a look out while I'm doing this. Warn
       me if you see a terrorist.
Amy: Okay...
Snake: >>141.12<< "Colonel!  I found a survivor!"
Campbell: "What?  You did?"
Naomi: "Good going, Snake!"
Kiyone: "Who's the survivor?"
Snake: "Her name is Amy Kadowaki...She's a scientist who hid from the
    terrorist attack..."
Kiyone: "Mihoshi, didn't you tell me you know this person?"
Mihoshi: "I said I just bumped into her in the hall one day...She 
      seemed a little miffed that I smashed some chemicals."
Kiyone: "And people ask why I go nuts sometimes..."
Snake: "Why DO you go crazy sometimes?" (Kiyone gets pissed hearing
    this)  "Just kidding..."
Otacon: "Snake, you have to get Dr. Kadowaki outta that place!  It's
     too dangerous for her to stay there."
Snake: "Who's the closest person in this building?"
Campbell: "Tenchi...But Nagi found some firearms all of you can use."
Snake: "I'll give her a call."^
Amy: What's up?
Snake: Gotta make another call...But don't worry.  I'll protect you...
       Promise.
Amy: (blushing a little) O-OK...
Snake: >>141.22<< "Nagi?"
Nagi: "Snake...What's shakin'?"
Snake: "I heard you have some firepower that could come in handy..."
Nagi: "I'm on my way...Minagi and I just finished terminating the other
      weapons."
Minagi: "You sound a little worried...What's going on?"
Snake: "The terrorists just took out the science lab...Only one person
       survived...Amy Kadowaki."
Nagi: "Got it...What floor?"
Snake: "46th floor."
Minagi: "Hang tight...We've just entered the express elevator!"
Snake: "OK."^
Amy: Friends of yours?
Snake: Sort of... (starts to worry)
Amy: What's wrong?
Snake: Let's hide somewhere...I have a bad feeling about this...
       >>140.69<< "Tenchi.  It's Snake.  Can you read me?"
Tenchi: "Loud and clear..."
Snake: "What's your situation?"
Tenchi: "I...I've been captured..."
