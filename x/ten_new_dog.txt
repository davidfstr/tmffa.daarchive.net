Disclaimer: I don't own any of these characters but one of them.
Don't sue me now 'cause I've made my point to you pretty clear.

Hello there, I have a strange and unusual tale to tell you. Its about a boy,
about the age of 15 or 16, that got an extraordinary
present for Christmas. This present sent him spiraling through time,
different dimensions, and many great adventures. Now I tell this great tale.

It was Christmas morning and everyone was filled with glee.
[Tenchi] Hey everybody, come on down let's open our presents!!

Sasami came running from her bedroom with Ayeka following her slowly.
[Ayeka] Can't we open our presents later? Its too early to be getting up.
Suddenly Ayeka realized what she was saying and that there were presents for
her. She woke up from her morning time slumber and ran to the tree.

Ryoko materialized at the tree just as Kiyone and Mihoshi came running from
upstairs.

[Everybody at once] Wow......oh my gosh......I got a present!!!

[Ryoko] Here is your present from me, Tenchi.
Tenchi was about to take the present when Ayeka jumped up and pushed Ryoko
aside.

[Ayeka] Open my present first, Lord Tenchi.

[Ryoko] No open mine!!!

[Tenchi] I'm not gonna open either one of your presents until I'm done with
everybody else's, because your fighting on Christmas morning. Jeez can't you
two get along?

Ryoko and Ayeka just stood there stunned.

[Sasami] Oh wow! Tenchi this is a great gift! Now I don't have to take so
long chopping the carrots! Thank you!
It was the Vegetable Chopper 2000. Sasami ran to Tenchi and gave him a big
hug.

[Tenchi] Well I'm glad you like it.

[Mihoshi] CANDY!!!!!! I got a big bag of candy!! Who is it from? Tenchi!!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

[Tenchi] I knew you liked candy so I just went out and got you a whole
bunch.
Tenchi walked over to were Ryoko and Ayeka were still standing. He took
there presents, while telling them to keep quiet and not to complain on
whose present he opened first.
Ayeka had got him specially made cushion to go on the straps of the basket
 that Tenchi carries the carrots in with.
[Tenchi] Wow Ayeka. Thanks for these. Those straps were wearing soars on my
shoulders.

[Ayeka] I'm glad you like them Lord Tenchi.

Ryoko had got him this device that looked really strange. Tenchi had no idea
what it was.

[Tenchi] Uh.....thanks Ryoko, but what exactly is it?

[Ryoko] It makes the carrots in the field pop right out of the ground, so
all you have to do is pick'em up.

[Tenchi] Thanks Ryoko. That will make my work much easier and faster.

[Sasami] Hey Tenchi this big one is for you.
Sasami pointed to the big one that was the size of an average TV.

[Tenchi to himself] Wow thats a big present.
Tenchi took the card of the top and read.
              " This present is to you Tenchi. It is for all the things
you've done
                  for us and for protecting us. We love you and have a merry

                    Christmas
                                                   With the most love we can
give you,
                                                      Kiyone and Mihosh

Tenchi opened the present and it was the cutest puppy he'd ever seen. It was
odd looking, but definitely cute.
[Tenchi] Oh wow ya'll got me a puppy!

Tenchi ran over to Mihoshi and Kiyone and hugged them tightly, but suddenly
there was a loud bang on the door.
Tenchi got up ready and alert and opened the door. There was a young girl,
about Tenchi's age there that looked like she had been beaten up buy some of
those punks that hang out in the alleys in the city.

[Stranger] Help me.
The stranger fell on the floor in front of Tenchi. He quickly picked her up
and laid her by the fire, the girl was shivering, Her clothes were wet from
the sleet and snow.
Her long hair was a really dark blue. Her lips were colorless. She had blood
running down her face and she had a black eye. There was a gash in her
stomach from what looked like a sword had cut her.
She looked over at the puppy, which was just staring at her.

[Stranger] So Zanna, I've found you at last.
Thats all they could her for right then she passed out.
