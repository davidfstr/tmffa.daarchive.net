And now on with the story. 

Note: I know Ranma is acting out of character. The reasons 
why will be explained in memories and flashbacks throughout 
the story. Also, in this story I'm throwing all of the 
Inner Senshi into Juuban high.   They are all the same age 
as Ranma, about 17.  Tomas is 19, but has been out of school 
since his parents' death, about two years, so he is in the 
same grade as Ranma.  I'm also making Hotaru 15 in this, but 
she goes to a different school.  This is an alternate Sailor 
Moon universe, bet the changes are pretty much in age.  In the 
Ranma Time-line it is about 14 months after the bombed wedding.  
For the Sailor Moon universe this is somewhere between Sailor 
Moon S and Sailor Moon SS.  This is NOT an SI fic.

Chapter 3
The Youma Comes to Play

	Tomas was enjoying himself.  It was his first day at 
school and already he had a beautiful girl on his arm.  When 
she pointed out her friends he felt his luck come in.  He was 
going to be eating lunch with five beautiful women, not just 
one.  He wasn't a pervert.  In fact no perverted thoughts had 
entered his mind.  He just loved the jealous looks he'' get from 
the guys because of this.  All of a sudden his danger sense 
kicked in again.  "Rei, get out of here now!  All hells about 
to break loose!"
	
	"What are you talk..."  her last words were cut off 
by a huge growl.  A giant, ugly youma had appeared in front of 
them.  Fortunately its back was facing them.  One of its clawed 
arms suddenly ripped forward.  Rei turned to yell at Tomas to 
run, but he wasn't there.

*********************************************************************

	Minako saw the claw coming at her and knew she was dead.  
As her death descended on her time seemed to slow down.  It 
seemed to inch toward her.  When it was but a few feet away the 
view seemed to shift.  She felt her body tip and could no longer 
see the youma.  As she watched the outer wall come closer time 
returned to normal.  The claw was driven into the ground and she 
was sitting behind someone.  Someone in a denim jacket to be exact.  
She recognized it from the morning's meeting with the two strange 
boys.  Her eyes went dreamy and started to flash little hearts.

**********************************************************************

	Tomas saw the clawed arm draw back and knew there had 
to be a living target at the end.  Considering the fact that there 
were four gorgeous women on the other side of the monster, Tomas 
knew that he had to move fast.  Seeing that the wall surrounding 
the school would stop him from cutting right (not to mention Rei 
was on that side of him), he cut left and headed toward the 
creature's target.  It was the blonde with the normal hair cut.  
<Hey, that's the girl from this morning!  Damn, can't let her get 
hurt.>  He reached her when the claws on the beast were only a bit 
more than a yard away.  He scooped her into his arms and sprang 
toward the corner of the wall.  <Less places to defend this way.  
It'll make my job easier, and I'm going to need all the help I can 
get.>  He then turned to face the monster that had ruined his lunch 
period.  It was blinking in confusion, sure that it had a kill, and 
now wondering where its victim had disappeared to.  Looking past 
the beast, he saw all the girls in shock.

	"Rei, get everyone out of here!  I can protect the blonde 
but not if I have to save all of you too!  MOVE!"

	The monster turned toward him with an evil grin that would 
do any bad guy justice.  Tomas saw that the girls were finally 
moving and heading toward Rei who was starring at him with a shocked 
face.  Then the youma charged.

****************************************************************************

	The other three girls stared at the spot Minako was at 
before Tomas moved her.  When Makoto heard Tomas's call to get Rei 
and get out of there she came back to reality.  The Youma turned 
toward Minako and Tomas when he called out, so Makoto shoved the others 
at Rei and started to run towards her.  When they reached Rei's side 
she explained her plan.

	"Its simple, the quicker we get out of here the quicker we 
transform and the quicker we can save them."  Rei was about to reply 
when a gut wrenching scream tore through the air.  Looking at the fight 
they all gasped.  In one voice both Ami and Usagi explained everyone's 
thoughts.

	"I think I'm going to be sick."

	Tomas was in front of Minako, who was busy loosing her lunch.  
He had a self-satisfied smirk on his face and was in a tight defensive 
stance.  He was busy admiring his handy work.

	The scream had come from the youma.  Its right arm was now 
nothing more than a stub near the shoulder.  The rest of the arm was 
currently shoved through the youma's other shoulder.

	The girls decided that this was a good time to leave and headed 
toward the school.  There they hoped to find an empty room so they could 
transform into their Senshi identities.  Unfortunately the unexpected 
happened.

	"The door's locked.  Now what do we do?  We can't get in."

	"Don't worry Mako-chan.  The boy can't see us here.  Lets 
transform right now."  Usagi was getting worried.  The fact that 
the boy was smiling at what he had done to the youma didn't sit well 
with her.  It was almost as if he had enjoyed it.  It was too bad 
that Ami had to spoil her plan.

	"We can't transform here Usagi.  They put people to watch 
from the windows.  If we transform they'll know our identities."  
Ami paused to think and came up with the only solution she could.  
"Everyone, there's a dumpster in an alley three blocks from here.  
We could transform behind it."

	Hope came back to Usagi's eyes.  They still had a chance to 
save their friend and the guy who had saved her before.  "Well, what 
are we waiting for?  Lets go!  Ready everyone?"

	"Lets do it!" cried Makoto.

	"Ready to go" said Ami.

	"......"  Rei was missing.

	Makoto looked around for a moment and spotted her.  She was 
already out the gate and heading down the street.  They all took after 
her trying to catch up.

*****************************************************************************

	Tomas gritted his teeth and spit out the blood that was in his 
mouth.  He was getting trashed and didn't like it one bit.  <This thing 
is full of surprises.  Maybe I should grab the girl and split.  There's 
no way I can take this thing down by myself without causing massive 
property damage.  I need to get Ranma.  Damn, too late.>

	The youma attacked again.  Tomas put up a successful defense 
this time.  He dodged the first two blows, blocked the next three (getting 
a viscous cut on his arm in the process) and then making a successful 
counter attack imbedding it into the school wall.

	For this breather he reflected on how things got out of hand.  
<I can't believe it regenerated the arm I cut off with my flame blade.  
Reminds me of something I saw in that Dragon Ball Z anime.  The fact that 
it then used the arm I cut off as a weapon shocked the shit out of me.  
I got to be careful against this thing.>

	Unfortunately he was a bit late on that self-advice.  He never 
noticed the blast the monster sent at him until it hit.  The blast 
threw him back and aggravated his injured are and ribs causing him to 
drop to his knees in pain.  He let out an agonizing scream as the pain 
flared through him.  The youma, seeing him no longer moving, leapt in 
for the kill.

*******************************************************************************

	Minako was scared.  Not for her own life.  Not of the youma in 
front of her.  These were normal things for Sailor Venus.  She was use 
to them by now.  She was scared for the young man trying to protect her.

	He was battered, bruised, cut, and showed no signs of stopping 
until he was dead.  When he threw the youma into the wall and it 
stopped moving she thought it was over.  She closed her eyes to give 
a prayer of thanks to the kami and missed seeing the monster throw the 
energy blast.  She noticed it the same time Tomas did, when it hit him.  
Minako shrunk back at the sound of his scream.  Then the youma lunged at 
them, and she was sure her hero was dead.

"MOUKO TAKABISHA!"

*******************************************************************************

	Ranma was in  a peaceful, deep sleep.  He was having no dreams 
that he would later recall, but there was a slight smile on his lips.  
The shaking of the room woke him, mostly because it caused him to fall 
out of his chair.  Looking around he noticed the room was empty.  He was 
still pondering this fact when he heard an explosion.  Even as he moved 
to the window to see what was happening, a terrible scream reached his ears.

	<That sounded like Tomas!>  He reached the window in time to see 
the youma leap towards his friend who wasn't even moving.  Ranma leapt 
out the window letting loose with one of his favorite attacks.

	"MOUKO TAKABISHA!"  A ball of bright blue ki shot from his hands 
and slammed into the youma driving it into the ground right in front of 
Tomas.  Ranma watched as Tomas slowly get up and move to place himself 
between the creature and a girl.

	"Ranma, be careful!  That things tough!  Just buy me a few 
minuets to rest and we can take it out together."

	"Okay, I'll see what I can do."  He turned back to the creature 
in time to dodge the energy blast that was coming at him.  Ranma chose to 
take the fight to the youma and moved into battle.  He dodged, ducked, and 
jumped over the club that was being wielded by the creature.  Seeing an 
opening he slid inside the monster's defenses.  "KATCHU TENSHIN ARMAGURIKAN!"	  
Ranma cut loose with over 500 punches in less then a second.  The force of it 
drove the ugly beast back into the hole Tomas originally created with it.  
It was then that Tomas appeared at his side.

	"Thanks for the save back there.  Listen, I've got an idea that's so 
crazy it might work."

	"You know the last time you told me that we had fifty people chasing 
us out of a town in china."

	"Yeah, but this time its different.  We have a demon chasing us instead."

	"So what's your glorious plan?"  Ranma was beyond scared now.  
His friend was smiling, and it wasn't an 'I'm happy smile' either.

	"You remember when we first met?"  Ranma was close to panic.  
"You recall how the fight ended?"  He was now prepared to bolt.  "Let's 
do it again."  Now Ranma was afraid.

	"AGAIN!?  Are you nuts?!"

	"Yes and yes, but you should know that by now.  You told me so 
yourself often enough."

	"The last, not to mention only, time we did that it almost killed 
the both of us!  And you want to do it again?!  With your arm mangled like 
that?!"

	"Look, Ranma, either I bleed to death, ugly over there kills me, 
or I die in the attack.  What do I have to loose?  At least this way I'm 
going down fighting."

	Ranma looked at his friends face and saw what was there.  A 
determination to win no matter what.  Deep in the eyes, he could tell Tom was 
calculating the chance that he will survive.  The front of the eyes showed 
that the odds didn't mean a thing to him.  He would not loose and even death 
wouldn't stop him.  Ranma sighed.  "Okay, lets it.  Try to lure it as far 
from the school as you can.  I'll start circling."

	The youma pulled itself from the wall and turned to face the boys.  
Ranma moved in what seemed like a flanking maneuver while Tomas took a 
defensive stance.  Minako wondered what was going on.  

	Seeing Tomas wounded and alone, the youma attacked him with a fury.  
Tomas dodged the attacks and countered enough to make sure that the youma 
wasn't moving from its spot.  As he did this he gathered as much heat as 
he could from his surroundings.  As soon as he finished this he tapped into 
the astral plane and gathered the mystic flames.

	Even as Tomas did this, Ranma started running circles around the 
two combatants.  Every lap he brought himself closer to the two.  Ranma 
concentrated on keeping his emotions cool and his fist cold.  <Two more 
laps to go.  One more.>  "NOW!"  He brought himself behind the creature 
and slammed his cold fist into its back.  At the same time Tomas drove 
his two flaming fists into the youma's chin.

	"HIRYU SHOTEN HAAAAAA!!!!!"

	"PHOENIX RISING INFERNOOOOOO!!!!!"

*********************************************************************************
	
	The sailor scouts where a block away when the attacks went off.  
They stopped and stared in shock as a tornado made of pure fire tore 
into existence.  Over a minuet and a half later it finally died out.  
A minuet after that they got their bodies working and sprinted toward 
the school.  

The youma, Ranma, and Tomas were gone.  Minako was in a corner of the 
yard staring into space.  They tried to question her, but all she could 
do was point over the east wall and mumble something about that way and 
being in love.  Exchanging a glance, the other Senshi hopped over the 
east wall and tried to fallow.
 
********************************************************************************

	"Man this hurts.  Only good thing is that the attack sealed my 
open wounds."  Tomas was in pain.  As he and Ranma roof-hopped toward the 
hospital, he was leaning heavily on his friend.

	"Don't talk Tomas.  You don't have the strength for it.  The 
hospital should only be a mile or so ahead."  Ranma was a bit on the 
crisp side but otherwise okay.  He was doing most of the work.

	"Hey, I wonder what everyone below us is saying, what with us 
glowing."  Both of their battle auras where flared up to help keep them 
moving fast.  Ranma was glowing blue where Tomas was red.  Tomas's was 
very faint, however.

	"Ah, they're probably talking about angles or some such thing."

	"Stop right there, demons!"

	"Well, Ranma, that blows that theory."  Tomas studied the people 
in front of him.  There were three women in sailor suits with ridiculously 
short skirts.  All of them looked too old to be dressing in such an outfit.  
One had short blonde hair and looked almost mannish in appearance.  Well, 
if one didn't look below the neck, anyway.  The next had long light green 
hair in waves.  The last had long dark green hair.  All three of them had 
the look of seasoned fighters.

	Ranma, on the other hand, was looking behind them.  He could feel 
some power sources heading straight at them and fast.  "Hey, brother, we 
got to make this quick.  More of them are coming up behind us.  We could 
handle these three, but if any more come we're toast.  Got any more plans 
up your sleeve?"

	Tomas didn't bother to reply.  His eyes were closed and his aura 
brightening.  He was once more gathering the flames of the astral plane.

	Ranma realized what was happening and moved behind his friend.  
He wrapped his hands around Tomas's waist to help steady him.  He then sent 
a quick prayer to any Kami that might be watching so that his friend might 
survive his attack.

	The blonde in front of them smirked.  "Hiding behind your injured 
comrade isn't going to save you, scum.  WORLD SHAKING!"

	"DEEP SUBMERGE!"

	Ranma quickly countered with one of his newer moves.  "STAR SHIELD!" 
A blue ki shield appeared before them.  The combined attacks slammed into 
the shield and knocked them back to the edge of the building.  The shield 
held, however, and neither one of the boys was hurt.   Ranma dropped the 
shield just as Tomas opened his eyes.

	The flames were raging inside of him.  Tomas could feel their power 
burn in his soul.  He prepared his counter attack and smirked right back at 
the girls.

	"Not to bad, girls.  No where near good enough, but still not to 
bad.  Maybe you'd like a taste of what I'm capable of."  He reached into his 
soul and drew forth the flames from within.  Directing the energy to form 
under the girls who were staring at him, he released the energy straight up.  

"PHOENIX FIREWALL ARISE!"

	A wall of mystical flames tore up from under the three outer scouts.  
Even as they started to scream in pain, Tomas collapsedd into Ranma's arms 
from the exertion, totally exhausted.

	Ranma only spared a moment to look in the flames at the three figures 
and then turned north carrying his best friend away from those who would harm 
them.  <I think we better stay away from home.  I don't want those others to 
follow us and get mom.  I think I'll try for grandfathers.  He's supposed to 
have a shrine out side Tokyo.  That's probably the best I can do.>

********************************************************************************

Next time: The chase is on!  Scouts wanting revenge, Martial Artists 
wanting a place to heal their wounds and aliens who want just one thing.  
And guess who Ranma's grandfather is.
