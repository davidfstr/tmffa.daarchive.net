Chapter 5: Dissent and Aggravation

	
	A rarity was taking place on the dawn of this 
new morning.  All of the Senshi were gathered 
together, even the elusive Setsuna.  It was only five 
hours since the Inner Senshi returned from the 
disastrous fight in the woods against Ranma, Tomas, 
and their allies.  School was canceled do to damage 
caused from the fight against the youma.  Each 
Senshi was relaxing in Rei's temple, doing what they 
will.

	Makoto was in the kitchen cooking up a fury 
of breakfast for them all.  Rei was in front of the 
sacred fire striving to learn something new about 
Tomas and Ranma.  She was confused at how they could 
save Minako one moment and attack the Outer Senshi 
the next.  The golden hair girl herself was currently 
sleeping on the couch, her white feline guardian 
curled up on the floor next to her.  Ami was sitting 
at the kitchen table with Hotaru, helping her with 
her algebra homework.  Michiru, Haruka, and Setsuna 
were trying to come up with a plan to get revenge on 
the two martial artists who defeated them the day 
before.  Usagi, leader of the famed Sailor Senshi, 
was busy reading all of Rei's manga.

	"Breakfast is ready everyone!"  Makoto 
finished laying out the food on the table.  Usagi 
dropped the manga and dashed toward the table.  
Everyone else moved at a more normal pace.  

After everyone was seated and started eating, Luna 
started the conversation that this meeting was called 
for.  "Sailor Pluto, why did you confront those two 
young men?  What reason did they have to attack you?"

Setsuana thought back to what she had seen in the 
time stream.  She shuddered slightly at the 
remembrance.  "Those two are surrounded by chaos.  
The time stream is bending and flexing at every 
single move they make.  Uranus, Neptune, and I went 
to find out whether they were dangerous or not to the 
future.  From their actions it is safe to assume 
that they are."

"I don't believe that!  The two of them saved my 
life!  There is no way that they could be bad!"

Pluto gazed sternly at Minako.  She couldn't believe 
how naïve Venus was.  The two boys had injured their 
princess.  There was no excuse for that.  They were 
enemies, by their own actions, and had to be dealt 
with.  But before Pluto could express her thoughts 
on the subject, Rei spoke up.

"Mina-chan, I had a bad feeling about the two of 
them the moment I saw them.  There is something wrong 
with them.  They may not be as bad as the Negaverse 
or Black Moon Family, but they are our enemies.  We 
can't let them wonder around the city, destroying 
the time stream and the future we're trying to bring 
about."

Setsuana took her turn once more.  "Venus, these 
people are dangerous.  They have attacked and injured 
us.  We can not risk them totally destroying the time 
stream that needs to be formed."

Minako looked very upset.  Her normally shining blue 
eyes were dark.  She looked around at her friends for 
any sort of support.  The closest she found were 
Hotaru's eyes, which looked deeply troubled.  All of 
the others had grim looks to them.  Even Usagi was 
serious.  She closed her eyes and came to a decision.
Minako stood up and looked over her friends and fellow
Senshi once more.  "Fighting against youma is one 
thing, but fighting against other people, who could 
be completely innocent, is something else entirely.  
I will not fight this battle."  She turned around and 
walked out the door.

The other Senshi and the moon cats stared at her in 
shock as she walked away.
********************************************************

	The Masaki home shook with the sound of 
explosions.  Fearing that the demented girls in 
sailor suits were back, the normal residence of the 
Masaki household raced out side.  What they saw was 
so different from what they had expected that they 
were too stunned to move.  All except Sasami, who 
decided to go start breakfast after seeing that they 
weren't trying to kill each other.

	Tomas and Ranma were sparring again.  This 
time, however, they weren't holding back.  Flames 
tore from the ground, yellow balls of Chi slammed 
into trees, giant balls of fire dropped from the sky,
 and miniature tornado's devastated the ground.  It 
seemed for all intents and purposes that they were 
trying to kill each other to anyone who wasn't paying 
close attention.  The only thing that kept anyone 
from interfering was the conversation that the two 
were having as they fought.

	"I see that you finally figured out to 
control the Meteor Strike, Tomas.  That would have 
been useful yesterday, huh."

	"So would have your Twister Blade, Ranma.  
Practice with it a few more times and you should 
have it down, no problem."

	"Yeah, I know.  What can I say, though, I am 
the best!  FLAMING CHI WAVE!"  An arc of golden chi 
flew from Ranma's sweeping hands.

	Tomas threw up a shield built from mystic 
flames as he realized that he couldn't dodge the 
attack in time.  Even as he let the shield fall, he 
saw that the attack was only a diversion.  Ranma was 
inside his defenses before he could blink.

	"KATCHU TENSHIN ARMA..."

	"Breakfast is ready everyone!"  Sasami didn't 
notice, but she had just saved Tomas from some rather
painful bruises.

	Everyone in the extended Masaki family was 
surprised to see the fight instantly stop.  They were 
also surprised to see both Tomas and Ranma jump over 
them and race into the house.

	Inside the house, Ranma, Tomas, and Sasami 
were sitting at the table waiting for the others to 
arrive.  A giant breakfast was spread out on the 
table before them.  Tenchi noticed, as he came in, 
that Sasami was seated next to Tomas, and that the 
two of them were  having a deep conversation.

	"So, Sasami-chan, what do you say?  How does 
that sound?'

	"I'd like that Tomas-oniisan.  What do you 
think, Ryo-ohki?"

	"Miya!"

	It was at this point that Tenchi and the 
others (including Tomas) first witnessed the Saotome 
School of Anything Goes Ceiling Clinging Technique.  
It was also at this point that the Masaki family 
learned of Ranma's fear of cats.

	"AAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!  C-cc-ccc-cca-CAT!!!"

	Ranma had been twitching nervously ever since 
he had sat down at the table.  It was like a cat was 
near him, but he couldn't see one.  The only thing 
that was close was the strange animal in Sasami's 
head.  When it had spoke, the fear hit him.  He was 
on the ceiling without a second thought.  Ranma 
scrambled to get away, but found himself backed 
into a corner.  Before Ranma's eyes flashed the 
shredding claws, the piercing teeth, and the yowl's 
of hundreds of cats.  The fear grew in him.  He 
could feel his sanity slowly drifting away.  He 
fought to keep it, to push back the Neko-Ken.  After 
all, a man wasn't afraid of cats.  Darkness started 
to overcome him.  He pushed harder and started to 
form mental walls to protect himself.  It was at that 
moment, right as he felt he was winning, that 
Ryo-ohki spoke once more, and pushed him over the 
edge.  

	Ranma-neko landed on the ground.

	Tomas, in the meantime, had been trying to 
get Ryo-ohki out of the room.  "Look, she's 
activating the Neko-Ken!  Just have her leave the 
room for a bit!"

	Aeka was angry.  <How dare this boy order my 
sister around in such a manner!>  "How dare you talk 
to my sister like that!  Who do you think you are?!"

	"I'm someone who's trying to keep his friend 
SANE!  This is the Neko-Ken we're talking about!  
It's driving him crazy!  Just get the fur ball out 
of hear!  I don't want to deal with this again!"

	Ryo-ohki, who had been listening to the 
argument while trying to decide what to do, objected 
loudly to being called a fur ball.  This caused 
Ranma to drop from the ceiling.   Mayuka walked up 
to Ranma-neko, who was busy cleaning himself.  She 
smiled and threw her arms around his neck and smiled. 
Ranma let out a soft meow.

	"Look, Daddy, we've got a pet kitty cat!  
Isn't he cute?"  She started to scratch Ranma-neko 
down the spine.  Everyone but Tomas and Mayuka was 
shocked when Ranma-neko started to purr.  "He likes 
me, daddy!  Can I keep him?  Please?"

	Tenchi could only stare at his cousin.  Ranma 
was currently rubbing his head against Mayuka's leg 
and purring quite loudly.  He stared at the two for 
some time until he turned to Tomas.  
"How...huh...ahhh...what...I mean...um...why's...a..
Ranma..ah.."

	"Tomas sighed and shook his head.  "He'll 
never live this one down."  All of a sudden, 
Ranma-neko lept from Mayuka's side landing on the 
table.  He then proceeded to devour Tomas's 
breakfast.  Tomas's eyes narrowed in anger.  He 
moved from where he was by Aeka and Sasami to in 
front of Ranma-neko.  "What do you think you're 
doing!  That's MY food!  Go eat your own!"  
Ranma-neko simply drew back one of his "paws" in 
response.  Tomas quickly backed down from the 
confrontation.

	Ryouko looked at Tomas and grinned.  "Don't 
tell me you're afraid of that little display.  
There's no way he could even be a decent challenge 
like that."

	"I once saw him create a six foot crater in 
the middle of a concrete road, and then shred a four 
inch steel door like paper while in this state.  I 
don't want to know what he can do to a human body."

	Mayuka, in the mean time, had moved to sit 
in Tomas's chair and started to scratch Ranma-neko 
again.  Ranma-neko had finished both Tomas's and 
Sasami's breakfasts, and was finally working on his 
own.  Everyone watched in fascination as he inhaled 
vast quantities in only a few minuets.  Ranma-neko 
then went over to Mayuka and laid down in her lap.

	"No one disturb him!"  Tomas felt relief 
flood his body.  He knew that everything would be 
fine.  There was someone who could calm Ranma from 
the Neko-ken.  "Just let Ranma sleep.  When he wakes 
up he'll be back to normal." 

	Sasami looked at Tomas and walked over to 
him.  "Tomas-oniisan, what happened to him?"

	"The truth, Sasami, I don't know.  All that 
Ranma told me was that his father put him through 
the Neko-ken training without reading the warnings.  
It left him with an intense fear of cats.  When the 
fear gets too great, he starts to act like a cat to 
escape it.  The fear is so deeply integrated in him 
that it can't be cured."  The extended Masaki family 
looked upon Ranma compassionately.  Tomas looked at 
the table and sighed.  <Great.  He devoured my food, 
and I'm hungry.  Guess I'll just have to go out for 
breakfast.>  "The only thing we can do is let him 
sleep.  In the mean time, however, I'm hungry and he
ate my breakfast.  I'm going to head into the city 
and eat.  I also want to stop at home and let Ranma's 
mother know what happened and where we are.  Sasami, 
do you want to come with me?  We can do that shopping 
we were talking about earlier on the way home."

	"Okay, Tomas-oniisan.  I'll go get ready."

	Tomas smiled at her.  "No rush, I've go to 
take a quick shower first.  Give me a half-hour."

	"I'll be ready."
***********************************************************

	Hotaru pushed herself back against a brick 
wall.  She was breathing deeply after what for her 
was a long run.  The fear that reflected in her eyes 
was like that of a deer faced with a pack of wolves.  
She knew that she had made a wrong turn, but there 
was nothing she could "Well, now, you witch.  We're 
going to be dealing with you once and for all.  
You'll never be a threat to us again."  Hotaru closed 
her eyes and waited for the end to come.
***********************************************************

	Ranma slowly came back into the land of the 
living.  The first thing he noticed was that he was 
curled up in a tight ball.  The second thing he 
noticed was a cat sitting in front of his face.  
<A cat???  A CAT!!!!!>  "AHHHH!!!  CAAAAT!!!"  He 
once more sprang to the ceiling and held on for dear 
life.  Moving quickly, Ranma headed toward the door 
while repeating 'cat' for all he was worth.  He 
reached the door and dropped, so that he could race 
out, only to land on Aeka, who was racing to find 
out what the scream was. 

	Aeka couldn't believe it.  Once more Tenchi's 
cousin had performed a perverted act on her.  Her 
first assumption of him was right!  He had to have 
been waiting for her to walk into the baths for the 
sole purpose of peeping on her.  Now he was faking 
fright so that he would get the chance to glomp her.  
She could deal with him, though.  "PERVERT!"  Once 
again she electrocuted Ranma.  <Maybe this time he 
will learn his lesson!>

	Tenchi raced into the room as Ryouko phased 
through the wall.  Tenchi quickly took in the scene 
and turned toward the Jurian Princess.  "Aeka what 
happened here?  I heard Ranma scream and then you.  
Is everything all right?"

	"Oh, Lord Tenchi, I'm so glad you're here.  
Your cousin tried to grab me!  I hope he learned his 
lesson this time.  I don't want him doing that 
again!"

	Tenchi looked down at his fried cousin, at 
the fuming Aeka, and at his daughter Mayuka, who was 
busy giggling.   He decided that he could best find 
out what happened by talking to his daughter.  
"Mayuka, what happened to Ranma?  He was sound 
asleep."

	"Well, daddy, I was scratching him on his 
head when he screamed cat.  He crawled across the 
ceiling again only to fall off and land on Aeka.  
Then Aeka screamed something and shot him with 
lightning.  Then you came."

	Tenchi sighed at what happened.  Yet another 
misunderstanding between Aeka and Ranma.  Tenchi 
began to get a feeling that this sort of thing was 
common to his cousin.  "Well, Aeka, next time find 
out what is happening before you hurt Ranma.  I'll 
take him upstairs and put him in bed.  I'm sure that 
he will apologize when he wakes up."  Tenchi picked 
his cousin up and carried him up the stairs.

	Ryouko turned to Aeka who was still trying 
to decide whether Ranma was a pervert or not and 
spoke.  "So, Princess, are you planning on killing 
him for accidents or just sending him into intensive
care?"

	"How dare you say such a thing demon!  I'll 
have you know..."  And so, yet another fight between 
pirate and princess got underway.
**********************************************************

	The sound of bones breaking caused Hotaru to 
wince.  She realized that she wasn't in any pain 
from it.  <I wonder how they could break my bones, 
but not cause me any pain?  Am I just blocking it 
out.>  The sounds of bones breaking continued, and 
moans of pain raised into the air.  It was at the 
scared screams and sound of running feet that Hotaru 
came to the conclusion that the boys chasing her had 
left.  She slowly opened her eyes to see how bad she 
was hurt, only to find herself looking into some of 
the deepest blue eyes that she had ever seen.  
**********************************************************

"Well, Sasami, what do you think of Ranma's mother?"

"I like her, Tomas-oniisan.  She reminds me of my 
mother in some ways.  And she had all of those 
wonderful recipes to give me!  I can't wait to get 
home and try them."

The two were walking through a park in the Juuban 
district.  They had left Ranma's home a short while 
ago, with Tomas carrying a large backpack that 
contained some spare clothes for himself and Ranma,
and three books of recipes for Sasami.  Nodoka had 
taken an immediate liking to the young alien 
princess.  She was also happy to hear that her father 
had excepted Ranma even with all of his problems.  
She made them promise that they would let her father 
know that she wanted to see him.  They were currently 
on their way to the store so they could pick up some 
groceries for the night's dinner.  Tomas looked down 
at Sasami and smiled.

	"You know something, Sasa... oh great.  Just 
what I needed."

	Sasami looked up at Tomas, who had suddenly 
become all serious.  "What is it?  Is their something 
wrong?"

	Tomas pointed down the path toward an alley 
between a couple of park buildings.  Sasami saw a 
few boys run into the alley.  "It looks, Sasami, 
like a gang just chased a girl into that alley.  You 
wait here, I'm going to go take care of them.  I hate 
people who go after girls."  Tomas put down the 
backpack and sprinted toward the alley at top speed, 
leaving a slightly surprised Sasami watching him.

	Tomas raced toward the alley with the intent 
to do serious harm to the punks that where chasing 
the girl.  Just as he entered he saw on of them 
raise a baseball bat to smash into her head.  Tomas 
acted first and thought later.  He jumped into the 
air and let a flying kick right into the bat 
wielder's arm, breaking it above the elbow.  Tomas 
spun from where he landed and drove his fist into the 
mans ribs, breaking two of them.  His third blow was 
an elbow smash to the head, knocking the punk into a 
forced sleep, incidentally shattering his jaw in the 
process.  A side-kick slammed the next boy into one 
of the walls, taking him how of the fight.  Tomas 
then dropped to one knee and rammed his fist into a 
third's hip, causing a fracture.  The boy dropped to 
the ground screaming in pain.  The fourth fell as 
Tomas sprang from his one knee crouch to deliver an 
uppercut that dropped the kid like lead.  The last 
two kids saw the injuries inflicted upon their 
friends and ran from the alley screaming like the 
devil himself was after them.  Tomas thought about 
blocking their escape with a Phoenix Fire Wall (and 
confirming that devil idea), but decided that they 
had probably learned their lesson and let them go.  
<Besides, the girl is more important.  I had better 
check up on her.>

	Tomas turned to the girl.  <Damn, she's cute. 
Oh, well, this is no time to put the moves on a girl.>
He looked at her and noticed her eyes where closed.  
<Shit, is she okay?  If those bastards hurt her, I'll
make them wish I had killed them instead.>  He knelt 
down in front of her and leaned forward to check her 
breathing.  At that moment her eyes opened up.  <Wow, 
I have never seen violet eyes before.  They're as 
uncommon as Sasami's.  Oop's, I'd better say 
something, she's giving me a real funny look.>  
"Are you okay?  They didn't hurt you, did they?"  
Tomas pulled himself back from Hotaru and looked at 
her with concerned eyes.  She didn't seem to be hurt, 
just scared.  "I'm not going to hurt you, so relax.  
I saw those punks chasing you and came to help."

	Hotaru looked at Tomas with eyes filled with 
awe.  She was having a hard time coming to grips with 
the fact that this total stranger came out of no where 
to save her.  "I-I'm okay.  Thank..."  At that point 
she caught sight of the damage that Tomas had done 
to the boys that where chasing her.

	Tomas saw what she was gazing at and realized 
that she had hid from the entire fight.  "Guess I 
went a little overboard, but I don't like it when a 
gang goes after a cute girl like that."  <What am I 
saying?  I shouldn't be hitting on her in a scene 
like this.  What would… uh oh, I forgot.>  Tomas 
gently helped her to her feet.  "Come on, a friend of 
mine is waiting for me to get back.  I don't want to 
keep her waiting."  Tomas led her out of the alley 
and to the tree that Sasami was waiting for him at.

	"Tomas-oniisan, are you okay?"  Sasami asked 
in a concerned voice.  A few moments after she 
watched Tomas enter the alley a pair of screaming 
young men ran out and took off.  She had been worried 
until he had led a young girl out of the alley and 
approached her.

	"Yeah, I'm fine, Sasami.  Those guys had 
less than no training.  It wasn't even interesting.  
Anyway this is... Uh, we never did make 
introductions."  Tomas looked at Hotaru and smiled.  
"I'm Tomas Megerson, and this is Sasami Masaki, my 
best friend's cousin."

	Hotaru fought to keep the surprise off her 
face when she heard that name.  It was the same one 
that Rei-san had given for one of the two boys that 
attacked her guardians.  The clothes that he was 
wearing were similar, too.  Unfortunately, both Tomas 
and Sasami noticed that look on her face.

	"What's wrong.  You look like you've just 
seen a ghost or something."  Tomas started to get a 
funny feeling about her.  It was hitting him in that 
point of his brain that said something was just not 
right.  He looked at her closely.  She didn't remind 
him of any one he knew, nor did she look like any of 
the fiancées that Ranma had mentioned.

	"I'm just surprised that someone so famous 
would rescue me."  Hotaru was thinking fast.  She 
knew that the fight between Tomas, the other boy, 
and the youma had be covered by the news.  She 
decided that the best line of approach would be to 
act like a normal girl would, and sort out all of 
the conflicts inside of her later.

	"What do you mean, famous?  I don't recall 
doing anything news worthy?  What are you talking 
about?"

	"You didn't know?  You and your friends' 
names were all over the news last night.  How two 
high school students managed to defeat a youma by 
themselves before the Sailor Senshi could arrive.  
Didn't you see it?"  Hotaru hoped that they would 
buy it.  It was the only thing she could come up with.

	"Actually, no, I missed it.  While Ranma, my 
friend, was dragging me to the hospital, these three 
psychos in really short skirts decided to jump us.  
Never did find out why they attacked us out of the 
blue like that.  The fact that they called us demons 
didn't help matters either.  Then another group of 
them showed up and started to chase us through out 
the city.  Let me tell you, it wasn't fun.  Oh, by 
the way, what's your name?"

"Hotaru."

"Well, come on, Hotaru, we'll walk you home so you 
don't have any repeat encounters."  Tomas picked up 
and shouldered his backpack again.  "Lead the way."

	As the three of them walked toward Hotaru's 
home they engaged in small talk.  Hotaru's mind 
wasn't really on the conversation, however.  She was 
trying to come up with how this person could be the 
same one who had attacked her guardians.  Not only 
had this Tomas saved her, but he was out in the open 
with a girl who was younger than herself.  No one 
who had incurred the wrath of the Sailor Senshi would 
be so bold as to walk in the open with an innocent 
girl, especially if that person had already shown to 
care for those who weren't Senshi.  Hotaru was 
confused.  If he had attacked the Senshi first, 
wouldn't he be taking precautions not to be caught 
out in the open by them like this?  Was he really 
that brave, or did he not care?  Perhaps Minako was 
right, And this was all a misunderstanding.

	By the time Hotaru got through asking herself 
all of these questions, she found herself in front of 
her home.  Saying goodbye to the two of them she 
headed inside to try to sort through the questions 
she had come up with.
**********************************************************

	Ranma slowly opened his eyes.  He looked 
around the room and noticed Tomas sitting in a chair 
grinning at him.  As Ranma recalled what had happened 
to him he buried his head in his hands.  "Why me?  
Why does this stuff always happen to me.  It is 
turning out to being like it was back at the Tendo's."

	Tomas continued to smile.  "If you look back, 
the whole problem started with your father.  If he 
had never trained you in the Neko-ken, this wouldn't 
have happened.  Of course, if your father wasn't an 
idiot, then you would have never had any problems to 
begin with."

	Ranma looked and was forced to agree.  "So 
what am I going to do now?  Aeka probably wants to 
kill me right now."

	"She doesn't.  Mayuka explained that you were 
trying to get away from Ryo-Ohki because she was 
activating the Neko-Ken.  She understands.  I suggest 
that you stay off the ceiling for now, though.  We 
can worry about it later.  Come on, dinner's ready.  
I'll tell you about my adventure later."

	"What adventure?"

	"I said I'll explain later.  Oh, and we're 
going home tomorrow night.  We got class on Monday, 
and your mother is making us go."  Ranma sighed as 
the two headed down the stairs toward the waiting 
meal.
*************************************************************

	Minako laid on her bed thinking about 
everything that had happened to her.  Her friends 
were changing in a way that she didn't like.  She 
saw it in their eyes that morning.  They were all 
willing to go and kill <yes I've got to think kill> 
two boys who had made no out right threatening 
gestures to them.  <Even if what Setsuna said is 
true, they probably expected to be attacked.  They 
were just defending themselves, right.  Until they 
prove that they are a threat to the scouts, I will 
NOT fight them again.  One time is enough.  I owe 
them that much for saving my life.>
*************************************************************

Author's Notes:  Well, it's finally out.  I had a bad 
case of writer's block early on, and that slowed me 
down.  I hope it's worth it.  Hopefully chapter six 
won't take so long.  Let me know what you think of 
the story so far.do about it.  The gang that had 
been chasing her since she took a walk in the park 
drew in for the kill.
