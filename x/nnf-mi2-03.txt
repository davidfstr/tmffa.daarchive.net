CHAPTER ONE -- BRIEFING

	"Sorry, I'm late, Yosho."
	Yosho turned around and saw Tenchi standing in the doorway.  Yosho chose a 
two story building near one of Seville's main roads.  The road outside was 
clogged with a procession of people honoring their saints.  Yosho looked down 
upon them with curiosity.
	"An odd festival," Yosho remarked, "They celebrate their saints by 
lighting them on fire.  Let's you know what they think of saints, don't they?  I 
almost got set on fire twice on my way over here.  So, I assume your recruitment 
of Miss Ryoko went well?"
	Tenchi saw a long wooden table in the middle of the large room.  He took 
his seat at the far end of the table, facing Yosho. 
	"Yes. . .it has," Tenchi beamed.
	"So, what took you so long?"
	"Got a little held up.  These streets weren't known for their swift 
commute.  Plus, this place was a little hard to find."
	"Sorry I couldn't be anymore clear on the directions."
	Tenchi shrugged.  "Well, you're sorry and I'm sorry."
	Yosho grinned coyly.  "Why did you phrase it like that?"
	"Like what?"
	"'You're sorry, and I'm sorry.'"
	Tenchi snorted.  "Bitch, get on with it."  Tenchi slapped a hand over his 
mouth as his eyes went wide with surprise.  Yosho looked at Tenchi with 
confusion on his face.
	"Repeat that, Agent Masaki?"
	Sweat beads rolled off of Tenchi's head.  "Oh, man, I am so sorry!  Stupid 
withdrawal symptoms or something, I guess."
	Yosho folded his arms across his chest.  "That habit is going to get you 
killed.  I thought we told you to clean yourself up or else we'd turn you over 
to the DEA?"
	"Sorry, sorry.  Please, forgive me."
	Yosho raised his chin in the air.  "Well, anyway, look at this."  Yosho 
motioned at something hidden in a shadowy corner.  A man walked out with a 
laptop in his hands and set it in front of Tenchi.  Yosho turned it on and 
clicked on a .AVI file on the desktop.  The movie file opened and Tenchi was 
greeted with a familiar face.
	"Hello again, Dimitri," Dr. Mihoshi said.  Tenchi studied her face and saw 
that her usually calm stature was broken up with worry; even her bright blonde 
hair seemed dampened with sweat and hung wiltedly around her head.  "I still 
remember when you saved our lives. . .saved our very sanity.  Again, I call on 
your services, old friend.  You see, every search for a hero begins with 
something that every hero requires. . .a villain.  It was our search for this 
hero, Bolerofaun, that we created a monster, Pokemon.  Dimitri, come to Tokyo 
and accompany me to Atlanta.  I must arrive at my destination in Atlanta in no 
less than 20 hours of departure.  Then it will be too late.  I will see you 
then, Dimitri; as always: I'm sorry, and you're sorry."
	The .AVI file ended and Yosho closed the laptop's cover.  "What do you 
think she's talking about?"
	Tenchi scratched his chin.  "I don't know, but it's a bad idea flying her 
on a commercial jet, so give me an update.  Is she still in Tokyo?"
	Yosho remained stern faced.  "She's dead, as is her colleague, Noboyuki."
	"Dead..."
	"She left Tokyo and booked a flight for Atlanta.  I tried contacting you 
but you were off in Utah sniffing crack, so I had to find a replacement.  Tell 
me, Tenchi, what do you think of Agent Kagato?"
	Tenchi scoffed at that.  "We had our reservations about each other."
	"That's it?"
	"Come on, Yosho, isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me this?"
	Yosho opened the laptop cover and clicked on antoher desktop file.  
Kagato's profile appeared on screen next to a large picture that dominated three 
quarters of the page.  He appeared as if he was leering.
	Yosho continued.  "When I couldn't find you I had to find a replacement; 
Agent Kagato seemed to be your best match."  Kagato's profile blanked out and 
was replaced with front images of Kagato's and Tenchi's face.  A line of 
symmetry was drawn down the middle both faces and a small message box appeared 
on the screen, stating that the facial similarities were a 98 percent match.  
	Yosho tapped the screen.  "He doubled for you, what, two or three times?"
	"Two.  Anyways, why did Kagato do this?"
	"So you do think it's Kagato?"
	"He's a little whore that can't cut the mustard.  He just got his paycheck 
docked again for the upteenth time in a row because of his screw up in 
Guatemala; that's motive, I think.  Besdies, Kagato doesn't think he's done a 
job right unless he leaves a lot of bodily organs on the ground."
	"Hmm.  Well, Mihoshi's plane ride went smoothily until it reached the 
Rockies.  It was then crashed to make it look like an accident.  Captain 
McIntosh was supposed to be the pilot on Flight 517, but..."  Yosho grabbed a 
file folder from the man that brought the laptop and flipped through it until he 
found a picture of a man in flight uniform.  "...he missed it.  However, he made 
the next one."  Tenchi looked at the picture.  It showed a bloody McIntosh half 
sticking out of a travelling suitcase.
	"Quite a small suit case," Yosho said, "Considering McIntosh's height."
	"That means he has accomplices."
	"Probably."
	"So, what was it that Kagato wanted on that plane?"
	"Pokemon.  We don't know what it is, but we were hoping you could bring 
back a sample of it to us.  Living, of course."
	"Hmm.  We'll have to figure out how he intends to make money with it."
	"That's where Miss Ryoko comes in."
	Tenchi looked at Yosho and saw that he was still stern faced.  "What do 
you mean?"
	Yosho reached back into the file and pulled out another page, this time it 
was littered with printed text.  "Ms. Ryoko and Kagato -- they were once a 
couple six months ago, and from what I gather, he was quite serious about it.  
They broke up, or rather she dumped him and left, and he's been wanting her back 
ever since.  Ryoko's job in this mission to resume that relationship, get him to 
confide in her, and find out further information."
	Tenchi shook his head in disbelief.  That meant that she would probably 
have to...  Tenchi stuck his hands out in front of him, as if trying to wave 
down an imaginary car.  "Whoa, whoa.  You made it sound like I was recruiting 
Ms. Ryoko for her skills as a thief."
	Yosho shrugged.  "Well, what can I say?  Shit happens."
	"But she has no training for this."
	"To go to bed with a man and lie to him?  She's a woman; she has all the 
training she needs."
	Tenchi scoffed and stood up suddenly.  "I don't like this.  It's...it's a 
very...sensitive situation."
	Yosho put his hands on his hips.  "You didn't sleep with her did you?"
	Tenchi nearly fainted.  "W-w-what!?!  Uh, how did...wait!  What?"
	Yosho put his hand on his forehead.  "What are you, James Bond?  You can't 
just sleep with women like that!  Bitch damn!"
	Tenchi growled and looked up at the ceiling.  "Oh, no.  No, no, no, no..."
	"So, is this going to make it difficult?"
	"That's the understatment of the f*&*@%g year.  Of course it's going to 
make it difficult!"
	Yosho flashed another coy smile.  "Well, this isn't Mission: Difficult, 
Agent Masaki, it's Mission: Impossible.  Difficult should be a walk in the -- "
	Tenchi's foot hit Yosho's groin hard, sending the old man crashing to the 
floor.  "Yeah, yeah, I saw the same movie previews as you did.  How the hell am 
I going to pull this off?"
	Yosho gathered himself and limped towards the table.  In a high pitched 
voice he pointed to a digital camera on a night stand near the door.  "Use 
that...<wheez>...to get her attention..."
	Tenchi walked to the table and grabbed the camera.  "Thanks.  I'll contact 
you upon completion of the mission."
	Yosho gave a thumbs up before fainting.  Tenchi walked out of the room, 
down the stairs, and into the crowded streets below.  The saints were still on 
fire and a man came to Tenchi with a torch in his hands.  His breath smelled 
like wine and his eyes were glazed over.
	"Ah, senor!  That angel face of yours, you must be a saint!  May I light 
you ablaze?"
	Tenchi smiled and pointed to the building he just walked out of.  "I'm 
sorry, you can't.  But there's two saints in that room on the second floor and 
they demand gratification by fire!  Go do it lest you invoke the wrath of the 
God who is called I AM!"
	The drunk man cheered and rounded up a group of torch bearers.  Tenchi 
walked merrily back to his hotel room while the torch bearers made their way up 
the stairs.

*******************************

CHAPTER TWO -- PERSUASION
TENCHI'S ROOM
	
	Ryoko tapped the right arrow key on the lap top keyboard.  The picture of 
McIntosh's bloody body was replaced with a burnt and incomplete husk of a 747 
jet.  Inside, the seats of the plane were charcoal black, contrasted perfectly 
with the white snow of the Rockies that lay all around it.
	She shook her head and silenlty said a prayer for the dead.  The carnage 
grew more and more gruesome as she flipped through the pictures.  The digital 
camera was wired to Tenchi's lap top.
	Tenchi watched her looking at the scenes of Kagato's attack.  Occasionally 
her shoulders would raise up a little then slowly slump.  She closed the lap top 
cover and shook her head.
	"How many people are capable of something like this?"
	"Kagato, for one."
	"Kagato...I tried hard to forget that name.  Did he do this?"
	"What was your relationship like?"
	"Skittish.  He wanted more than what I was ready to give; in the end, he 
ended up taking it."
	Tenchi winced.  "Rape?"
	"No.  Clothes.  My dresses were worldly reknown for their splendor and 
beauty.  He was in a cross dressing phase then and needed to get off.  Oh, God, 
the long nights...the role playing...I hated that stupid ass strap on."
	Tenchi stood there with his mouth open.  "Oh."
	"In the end, I couldn't take it anymore.  I just said: 'Listen you little 
queen, I'm not putting up with anymore of your bullshit!  I out!'  His partner, 
Ayeka, was a bitch and then some as well, so I just went to my closet one day, 
grabbed some Vera Wang dresses and threw them at him, told him he could keep 
them, flipped him the bird, and left.  It was the worst relationship I was ever 
in.  Oh yeah, he liked sex a lot too."
	"Oh."
	Ryoko then turned around to face Tenchi.  "Now look what he's gone and 
done!  Was the break up that bad?  Those poor people!"  She walked over to 
Tenchi and embraced him.  Tenchi returned the gesture and kissed her on the 
forehead.
	"This wasn't over clothes, Ryoko."
	"Really?  My wardrobe was the shit back then, are you sure?"
	"Positive.  He's after something called Pokemon."
	"Never heard of that line."
	"It's not a clothing line, Ryoko!  Based on Mihoshi's 
background...no...she wouldn't make something like that."
	Ryoko broke the hug.  "Mihoshi?  Who is she?  Oh, please don't tell me 
you're involved with another woman!  I can't stand competition; I can be a 
little...deadly."
	Tenchi felt a cold bead of sweat drip down his neck.  "Uh, no.  She's 
dead."
	Ryoko quickly resumed the hug.  "Oh, good."
	Tenchi gulped hard and looked Ryoko square in the eyes.  "I was lied to by 
my superiors.  I wasn't supposed to recruit you as a thief, but apparently..."
	Ryoko broke the hug again.  "Are you saying I'm supposed to forgo my 
superficially physical and sexual relationship to you, infiltrate Kagato's hide 
out, convince him I'm worth trusting with valuable secrets by sleeping with him 
thereby making you extremely jealous and angst ridden, extract information about 
Pokemon and report back to you while dodging a hail of possible gunfire and 
uncontrollable rage?"
	Tenchi's jaw dropped to the ground.  "Uh...yeah."
	Ryoko resumed the hug.  "Oh, okay."
	Tenchi broke the hug this time.  "W-w-what?  You're not putting up a fight 
here?  I thought you'd get all defensive about it."
	Ryoko pointed to the lap top.  "And let more people die like this?  If my 
body is all that stands in the way between us and possible deaths of more 
innocent people then I'm just going to have to get spread eagled and become a 
savior."
	Tenchi reached out and grasped Ryoko's shoulders.  He let his thumb 
massage her collarbone while he thought of something to say.  Man, he thought, 
this is...this is...
	Ryoko put her face close to his, her fragrance bombarding his nose, much 
to his delight.  "What is it, my love?"
	Tenchi put his right cheek on hers, savoring her warmth.  "This is not 
what I had in mind."
	She whispered back.  "But it is what you'd like me to do?"
	"I just thought that...that...your conscious would be your guide."
	Ryoko stifled a small giggle.  "I don't have a conscious, Tenchi; I'm a 
bloody thief."
	Tenchi sighed and swallowed real hard.  Ah, to hell with it, Tenchi 
thought, it's just one little job; she's all mine once I bring Kagato down.  
Ryoko brought her face within close space to his again.  "You know, he's going 
to be awfully suspicious if I just show up and say: 'Honey, I'm home.'"
	Tenchi wrapped his arms around her waist.  "He wouldn't be suspicious if 
he was the one to help you out of a major jam."
	Ryoko smiled. "I'd need to be in real serious trouble."
	"Serious trouble is something that I can easily arrange."
	"Sex now?"
	"God, yes.  I was wondering when you'd say that."

************************

CHAPTER THREE -- ARRANGEMENTS

	The next day was a blurred montage of events.  Ryoko only had little time 
to get injected with a small tracking device.  It hurt when the soft flesh of 
her ankle was punctured by the needle, but with that done, Tenchi could watch 
her with an IMF satellite and could track her location up to a distance of three 
feet.  Mock criminal files were made up and put out over the world.  Every major 
law enforcement agency on the globe received news of Ryoko's "capture" and 
"crimes."  She had been frightened then, she almost thought she was being 
arrested for real.
	"Relax," Tenchi said, his voice soothed her nerves.  "I'm not going to let 
anything happen to you.  With your information out all over the world Kagato 
will have no choice but to find you.  I know for a fact that after that plane 
crash, he's monitoring every news band he can find.  Once he knows where you are 
he'll get you out, plain and simple."
	She was placed in detainment and awaited for someone to get her out.  She 
alone in a cold cell with nothing around her.  No company, no friends, no 
love...it was like...being in a cave.
	She shook her bad thoughts away.  Someone would come...

*********

	She wouldn't wait too long.  Someone from Kagato's HQ would forge papers 
and get her out to escort her to Japan.  Ryoko and Kagato's henchman walked down 
the concrete steps of the police building and towards an awaiting car.  Tenchi 
was across the street, silently watching them.  Once, Ryoko saw him and looked 
at him longingly.  He smiled back at her, steadfast and firm, trying to keep 
both their hopes up.
	Ryoko remembered Tenchi's final words to her: "Ryoko...I'm not going to 
lose you...I promise."

*********

HOURS LATER
3 MILES OUTSIDE JAPAN

	Tenchi stood in a forest near a lake.  A house stood next to the lake, 
alongside a small pier with a helipad landing marker on it.  It took some time 
to assemble his two member team, and he thought old friends were in order to 
make this job go off without a hitch.
	Sasami Jurai was a talented computer hacker, and once she helped him out 
while they were both on the run from their own agency, victims of a twisted and 
evil plan.  She was the best thing to happen to computers since Bill Gates 
except she wasn't bent on world domination and her web browser didn't monopolize 
the shit out of one's computer.  It would be good to see her again.
	Washu was the most genius scientist in the universe and could do almost 
anything with a floating lap top and a sample...but why she wanted a government 
job, no one knew.  Her reputation reached Tenchi's ears back in '98 and '99 when 
her Monica Lewinski robot had successfully infiltrated and toppled the American 
government.  He was all too eager to work with her when he found out she was a 
fellow agent.  She was also a very talented pilot.
	The wind kicked up a little as he heard the humming sound of an inbound 
helicopter.  Within minutes, a small helicopter came into view over the trees 
and gently landed on the pier.  The first one out of the plane was Washu, her 
wild red hair sticking up in the air like an antenna.
	"Ah, you are Agent Washu, correct?  I've heard so much about you; I'm 
really excited to see what you're capable of."
	Washu scoffed and put her hands on her hips.  "NO!"
	"I'm sorry, what did I do?"
	"You called me Agent Washu!"
	"Isn't that who you are?"
	"NO!  You can call me...Little...Washuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!"
	"W-w-what?  But, Agent --"
	"NO!  Call me Little Washu!"
	"Uh, okay, little Washu."
	"That's better."  With that, she walked off towards the house.  "I'm gonna 
check out your pad, hope the John works, helicopters always give me the trots."
	Tenchi looked after her, confused.  "I thought she'd be a little more 
refined...hmm."
	Something was tapping Tenchi's knee.  He turned around saw a cute, cuddly 
ten year old girl with blue hair and bright pink eyes poking his knee.  
"Sasami!"
	"Tenchi!"
	Tenchi picked Sasami off the ground and gave her a huge bear hug.  "How 
have you been, Sasami?"
	Sasami sighed and her shoulders slumped.  "First, I step in dog doo 
thereby ruining my $800 Gucci shoes, and then you get me in a helicopter with 
that woman?  I'm surprised I'm still alive."
	"She's a bad pilot?"
	"No, it's just that she's always wanting samples...ugh, I'm not even going 
to mention that, but other than that, I'm good!"
	Tenchi nuzzled Sasami one more time; he couldn't help it, she was just so 
cuuuuuuuute.  (Like page 124 of the 3rd Tenchi Manga cute!)

*********

	Sasami set up her lap top on the kitchen counter and punched in the map of 
Japan.  Tenchi stood behind her, eagerly awaiting a satellite visual on Ryoko.  
Tenchi then heard the sound of a toilet flush.  At that moment, Washu walked 
into the kitchen with a stream of toilet paper attached to her right heel.
	She looked happily at the both of them.  "I just want to say that it's an 
honor and a priviledge for you to work with a genius like me!"
	Washu Doll A appeared on her right shoulder.  "IT'S AN HONOR!"
	Washu Doll B appeared on her left shoulder.  "AND A PRIVILEDGE!"

*********

	The beach house outside Tokyo was Kagato's pick of location.  Ayeka 
would've preferred something more discreet, but Kagato intervened.
	"I'd relax if I were you," he told her once, "Soon, we'll have riches 
beyond compare."
	Ayeka nodded, saying and acknowledging nothing.
	Outside of the house, on the long pier that led to the house, Kagato 
awaited for his long lost love, Ryoko.  A small white speck on the horizon was 
certainly the boat Ryoko was on, and as it got closer and closer, her hair color 
became more and more pronounced.  Soon, the boat landed on the dock and out 
stepped Ryoko.  She wore tight fitting jeans and a white cotton tank top.  A 
purple scarf draped around her neck, and the body it was all attached to was 
exceptionally well curved.
	Kagato stood at the end of the dock, watching in awe as the captivating 
woman walked toward him.  Away at the house, on a balcony, Ayeka stood watching 
the whole procession with disgust.  She had her own reservations about 
Ryoko...but it wasn't the time to air them.  Yet.
	Ryoko walked slowly and with purpose, letting him get a full look at her 
body, her face, her hair, the way she walked.  She wanted to blind him with lust 
in the hopes that he wouldn't grow suspicious.  Away from Kagato, back at the 
house, she spotted a woman standing on the balcony with long streaming purple 
hair.  Ryoko smiled inwardly; and how are you today, Ayeka?  She looked back 
towards Kagato and saw that her ploy was working.  His jaw was slightly agape 
and he stood there, not making a move.  Damn, I'm good, she thought.
	Ryoko was a few feet away when Kagato broke out of his trance and met up 
with her.  She offered the best looking, superficial smile that she could and 
turned her neck the right way to make herself look coy.  "Kagato, darling, how 
on earth did you find me?"

*********

	Tenchi grew impatient.  "Come on, Sasami, can't we speed this up?"
	Sasami entered the map coordinates from Ryoko's tracking chip and twice 
the satellite was unable to focus in.
	Sasami turned to Tenchi.  "With what?  This is the only computer that can 
do this."
	Washu grinned.  "Or is it?"  Her floating lap top suddenly appeared in 
front of her and she entered in a few key strokes.  Suddenly, Sasami's computer 
came to life and the satellite focused in the desired location.
	Tenchi smiled.  "Thanks Agent -- I mean, little Washu.  How'd you do 
that?"
	Washu stretched.  "Well, since I don't want to break protocol and break 
the rule that only Sasami's computer is the only one that can access the data, I 
simply used my computer to speed her's up.  I did it by a simple thing called 
Inter-BIOS Linking.  Basically, I just lent her computer some of my computer's 
power."
	Puppet A appeared.  "YOU'RE THE GREATEST, WASHU!!!" 
	As did Puppet B.  "YOU'RE SO SMART, WASHU!!!"
	Washu went teary eyed.  "Ain't it the truth?"
	Sasami rolled her eyes.  "Anyways, it's coming up."
	The satellite beamed back the image and what Tenchi saw left him 
angry...and jealous.

*********

	A wind suddenly kicked up and blew Ryoko's scarf from her neck.  Kagato 
was almost as fast as lightening; his hand reached out and grabbed the scarf 
before it was lost to the sea.  
	She looked at him lustfully.  "Thank you."
	He handed it back to her.  "You're welcome.  As for your earlier 
question...how did I find you?  It's how I normally find you...magic."
	All right, Ryoko thought, if I'm going to do this, I have to go all the 
way.  Ryoko bent her face towards his and leaned into him.  Kagato swallowed 
hard and his hands went to caress the waist he sorely missed for six long 
months.  As his hands met her body, her lips met his.  Soon, they were arm in 
arm, kissing each other passionately.
	Ryoko felt his tongue gently gliding towards her lips.  Somewhere, deep 
down inside Ryoko's soul, a single voice quivered: Tenchi, please forgive me.

********

	The satellite image was clear -- too clear for Tenchi.
	Washu snuggled up close to the computer screen.  "Wow.  Now that's a guy 
that knows how to give a proper welcome!"
	Sasami eye balled Washu for a moment.  Washu looked at the little girl.  
"Oh, don't worry, you were not bad."
	Sasami shook her head and went to the fridge.
	Tenchi stood rigid, his face stern, arms crossed over his chest.  Just one 
little job, he thought, just this one tiny, little, miniscule job...and then 
it's over, she's yours, 100 percent, 24/7, any way you want, all the time, every 
time.  He felt his curled fists slowly turning white as the blood drained away 
from them.  Kagato and Ryoko leaned into each other and Tenchi did his best to 
remain professional.
	They stayed in each other's arms a moment longer before walking back into 
Kagato's beach house.  Although Washu and Sasami probably couldn't see it, 
Tenchi could've sworn he saw after glow hovering around the pair.  He finally 
unclenched his fists and noticed blood on his palms.  Looking at his hands 
further he realized that his fingernails had bit through the flesh.  At least, 
Tenchi thought, I have an excuse to leave now.
	"I gotta hit the bathroom, ladies.  Excuse me for one moment."
	Tenchi walked off and Washu turned to Sasami who was happily constructing 
a sandwhich.  "Hey, little girl, you're cute you know that?"
	Sasami looked worried.  "I'm not giving you any sample, okay?  Get outta 
here with that!"
	Washu got on her knees.  "Please, Sasami?  Please, please, please, please?  
It'll only take a minute!  All I need to do is just scrape --"
	Sasami stamped her foot on the ground.  "You ain't scrapin' sh*t, woman!  
Just back off and act profressional!"
	Washu lamented.  "How will I ever complete my research?"  She then cried a 
river.

*********

	Ayeka had walked back inside and stood next to one of Kagato's henchman, 
Wallace.  Wallace ran a scan over Ryoko's body.  On the computer he was working 
on, it showed Kagato and Ryoko walking up the steps and into the house.  A red 
line ran horizontaly up and down Ryoko's body, and a percentage in the left hand 
corner was tallying up a number.
	The scan was complete and the percentage showed zero percent.
	Wallace whistled at the sight of Ryoko.  "No flies, no bugs either.  She's 
clean."
	Ayeka smirked.  "So are all cats.  Hmph!  Monster woman."

*********

	Kagato led Ryoko to his bedroom.  It was spacious and each wall had three, 
ten foot windows shaped like narrow arches.  Ryoko saw a king sized bed in the 
middle of the room and on that bed was a scarlet dress.
	"You're room?" she asked.
	Kagato ran a hand down her arm.  "Our room."
	Kagato went to the dress and handed it to her.  "I felt bad after how we 
last split up, so I got you this dress.  Put it on, I'm dying to see if I 
remembered your size."
	Ryoko gulped hard and thought of Tenchi's angel face when she saw the 
dress.  It's now or never, she thought, just do this and Tenchi will be yours 
from now on.  Just this once...
	Ryoko slipped out of her tank top and took off her bra, followed by her 
jeans, then her shoes, then her under --
	The sight of her was breath taking on an exponential level.  Kagato 
struggled to regain his compsure after he let his jaw hang open the minute the 
last shred of clothing came off.  His breath caught in his throat and he labored 
to maintain a working breathing rhythm.  God, Kagato thought, it's the face of 
God.  No doubt about it.  She then arched her back and showed Kagato what he was 
missing in her absence.  No f*$%*#g doubt about it.
	Ryoko then went for the dress only to have Kagato stopping her.  His face 
was lit up with a burning energy, an energy he couldn't hold back any longer.  
He felt he was going to explode.
	She looked at him innocently.  "You're not interested in seeing how it 
looks?"
	"Oh, I am...later."
	Ryoko felt his hands smoothing over her body.  She felt like wretching but 
didn't resist his touch, and didn't resist his eagerness as she was gently 
pulled down onto the bed beside him.
	Tenchi, forgive me.

*********

	Tenchi was alone in the kitchen.  Sasami and Washu had carried their 
arguments outside, leaving him to watch the screen alone.  All he saw was the 
roof of Kagato's beach house with a single yellow pulsating dot blinking at 
timed intervals in the center of it.  She was inside now, and the information 
would be soon forthcoming.
	Tenchi closed his eyes and shook his head.
	Sasami came in just then, a weary look on her face.  "That woman.  Ugh.  
So, is she in?"
	"Yeah."
	"Well, then we got him, don't we?"
	"We don't have anything, or what he's got, and what he's doing in Tokyo 
with it.  I'd say we just rolled up a snowball and tossed it into hell."
	Tenchi sighed and stormed out of the house.  Sasami sat down in front of 
the computer and wondered about the woman named Ryoko that Tenchi seemed so 
concerned about.  It was just a mission, nothing out of the ordinary.  She 
sighed and watched on, looking for any odd signals.
	And the yellow dot blinked on...

this one was the longest of them so far as I'm trying to wrap this thing up.  
School's getting to be time consuming, so the more I write, the less I write, or 
whatever.
