		Chapter 2 of The Armageddon Prophecy
				 Almost Together

Ten thousand years ago in the system of the gray star
A shogun magi known only as Dark Raven emerged
His only thought was to destroy the Universe
Only to create his own and be hailed as a god
His selfish wish would go on unfulfilled
The magi was soon chased by three goddess
In an attempt to save the universe
No one could figure out how he would do it
But they knew it required three planets
Juria; Earth; And the Planet of the gray star
In his haste the magi was corner on earth
He was then sealed by the three goddesses
To spend eternity on this primitive planet
But it was this that sparked mans rise in power
This divine intervention started the rise of a race that
Would ultimately destroy this prison some time in the future
As to stop this the goddesses spoke that
If the prison is to break five groups of heros
Would come together to stop Dark Raven 
And end the Armageddon Prophecy
Forever

Lead by Tenchi Masaki and Ranma Saotome
A small army will try to stop an end to all things
As we know them
And a war will be waged
One like this world has never seen.

Ranma, shrug off that comment and went to his seat at the table for breakfast
and wondering again how did he get into this mess in the first place.  'I got
three fiancees and I'm only in high school, to some people that's good but I
want...' Ranma's train of thought was interrupted by Akane came down to her
seat at the table and started in on the conversation.  She was all dressed up
for the picture day and actually looked like a normal girl.  'Why haven't I
noticed her like this before?' Ranma questions to himself.

A-ko had just gotten up for the day.  She wiped the sleep from her eyes and
looked at her cloak.  "Eight O' Cloak, I'm late!" A-ko gasped.  She got
dressed for school when a familiar voice filled the air.  "A-ko I've got some
news for you!" C-ko cried, "Because of your fighting with B-ko (Inventive
names!) we have been switched to a school on the other side of town from the
old one!"
"What's it's name C-ko!?!" A-ko cried as she grabbed her books and went out
the door.  She stood and waited for an answer to her question.
"Furikan High," C-ko answers in her cheery voice, "I hear with the people
there we'll fit right in."
"Okay lets go.  I think I know where it is," A-ko replies, "C-ko is it another
all girls school?"
"Nope, but A-ko....." C-ko answers being cut off in her sentence.
A-ko grabs C-ko's arm and dashes off in the direction of the school waving C-
ko behind her.

Ranma saw something out of the corner of his eye. He turned to see a red
haired girl running at a very high speed waving what appeared to be a little
blonde girl holding on for dear life behind her.  The girl charged through the
street knocking Ranma into a wall.  He got up a bit dazed but still able to
walk, He looked over to see Akane and Nabiki standing there amazed a strange
sight as he stumbled to his feet.  "What is it you two?" Ranma looked at Akane
in a puzzled manner. "What is going on here?"
"That girl that ran by here looked a lot like Ranma-chan, but the hair was a
bit different," Nabiki answered.
"Erie," Akane said.
"Well on our way we go.... Akane can I have some of your wallet sized photos?"
Nabiki asked with a grin on her face.
"Not if they wind up in Kunos locker again," Akane said with a sour look on
her face.
A yell came from the distance, "What do mean I don't have to be here till
8:30!"  Suddenly a very angry red haired girl comes up the path with her
little blonde friend right behind her. She then heads toward Nekohanten, a
small ramen shop near by.  "We have time, we should meet this new girl..."
Ranma said being cut off in the middle of his sentence.
"And add another fiancee to the collection," Akane laughed, "Maybe you'll
marry this one."
"Ha ha ha, very funny," Ranma says, "We should stop her before she takes m...I
mean Ranma-chan's job."
"Good point," Nabiki argues, "I don't know what I'd do if I lost a job."
"Make up another," Akane sneers, "Like selling my picture to Tatewaki!  Okay,
I'm game.  May we found some one to get Tatewaki off both our backs, Ranma."
They head toward the shop oblivious of a shadow behind them. "Good, Good," The
shadow laughed, "Jaws should be waiting for you!"

"Serena, get up it's time for school," Serena's mother yells into her room.
"Do I have to?" Serena cries back.
"Yes, especially since your going to a new school," Serena's mother yelled
into her room (Fate or writers block you decide.), "Furikan High."
"What!!" Serena yells back, "What about my friends?" Serena says running out
of her room ready for school.
"Your friends will be there too, so move or you'll be late," Serena's mother
says.
"Yes mom," Serena says running out the door alone to be meet with her good
friend Amy.
"Hello Amy,"Serena says, "Do you know why we got transferred to a new school?"
"Plot hole," Amy says under her breath.
"What?"Serena asked.
"Nothing, look there's the others," Amy points to the other members of the
team.
"Hello everyone!" Serena yelled waving her hand in the air.
They continued to chat until they reached a small dojo and they saw who else
but Ranma and the others standing there talking. "Who's that guy over there
he's cute," Mina said pointing at Ranma.
"See those two, Mina, one could be his girlfriend," Rei said pointing at Akane
and Nabiki.  She suddenly jumped in the air and land in front of a bush and
reach in with one of her wards in one hand.  Suddenly a dark hair man jumps
out of the foliage and looks at the girls and rips off the ward.
"You think you can out match a dark knight, HA," The man laughed aloud as he
shouted catching the attention of the three on the other side of the street,
"My power is that of my name..... SET TO ARMS!!!  I wear the armor of cruelty,
now face your pain!!!  SCORPION STRI....." In the middle of his maneuver Set
was interrupt by two sharp kicks to the back.  He turns to see Akane and Ranma
read to fight him.  "Puny mortals I don't have time for you.  I will return if
you best Jaws and Rampage.  Adue," Set bows and disappears.
"Are you okay ladies?" Ranma said but was followed with a punch in the back of
the head.
"Of course they are," Akane add in, "Now we were on are way."
They all head toward the ramen shop and find A-ko at a table in a conversation
with C-ko about politics for some strange reason.  "I've got an idea to get
their attention," Akane says.
"Shampoo think you are nuts, Shampoo think your plan won't work," Shampoo
interrupts.
"You haven't even heard it yet," Akane screams.
"I'm with her," Rei remarks pointing toward Shampoo.
"Who asked you!" Akane screamed and a faint blue aura started to appear around
Akane.
"Shampoo think it would be wise for Hot-headed girl to run for the hills,"
Shampoo whispers to Rei.
"No I'll stan...." Rei is cut off in the middle of her words and is knock flat
on her back.
"Hot-headed girl should have listened to Shampoo, Shampoo see this all the
time," Shampoo said.
"What the heck was that!" A-ko screamed getting up from the table.
"That was Akane Tendo mad," Cologne said as she entered the room, "I think she
should have listened to Shampoo's warnings a little better."
"Mommy I don't want to pet the pretty pony," Rei said in a semi-consutous
daze.
"Remind me never to get on her bad side,"Serena said pointing to Akane.
"Hello, my name is...." Ranma starts but Akane splashes him with ice water.
He changes into Ranma Chan.  The sailor moon team, A-ko, and C-ko gasp as
every one else laughed at Ranma, who was now Ranma-chan.  
"You look like..."A-ko gasps as she notices the resablance to her self, "Me
but with a different hair cut.  Amazing how did you do that."
"A curse, and not one I particularly like," Ranma-chan said looking down,
"Well for once I can't wait to get to school."
"Let's go," Amy said.
"Not so fast you," Jaws counts the people in the party as he stops them in
their tracks, "Eleven, now prepare to....... Set I could use some help here
out numbered you know."  Upon saying that four lightning bolts streak down
from the sky. 
"You called," One said.
"Do we have to fight them wolffie, why can't we just anality them in one
blow,"Another, this one a girl, remarked to the first.
"Shut up, you ditz.  We fight for the glory of my home planet and for my
mentor," Another girl shouted, "DARK KNIGHTS TO ARMS!"  Then all of them
formed into armor one you would remember as Darkwolf. One was dressed in Snake
armor.  Another in that of an owl and one of Black Eagle.  Jaws formed into
Pirhnia armor and was swinging a chain with hooks on either end.
"I'm Flightwing," The one in owl armor said to the stunned mass of people, "My
mentor, Miss Washuu Chan would be so proud.  Now I can take her place and I
will be the greatest scientific mind in the universe."
"I'm Eagle eye," the one in black eagle armor screamed, "My bow screams for
your blood!!!  prepare to die!!!"
"My name is...ah," The one in snake armor said twirling a bit of hair coming
out of the face mask, "Wolfie what is my name again, I forgot."
"Silia dear," Darkwolf said, "For the thousandth time it's Silia!"
"Lets get to it though I'm board standing here and talking," Jaws said.
"Sorry Jaws we have to leave now, you too.  We found Dark Raven," Darkwolf
said.
"But still before then we should destroy all meddlers, that threaten Dark
Ravens plan," Jaws said.
"Your right my putrid friend let us defeat one of the two great generals,"
Darkwolf laughs.

"What!?!  Not now I have to get moving to track them.  I know!" Washuu said in
one breath.
"Not now what?" Ryoko asked as she entered the room.
"This is terrible!!!! My arch nemeses has returned from the grave and he has
followers!!! Get Tenchi and the others in here, PRONTO!!!!!" Washuu screamed.
"Kagato!!!  Back from the dead!!!! But how!!!" Ryoko screamed back.
"Not Kagato, some one a lot worse.  Just get them it's a matter of life and
death for countless souls!!!"Washuu screamed.
"On it," Ryoko said as she left.
"The fate of this and other worlds rest on our shoulders,"Washuu said with a
tear in her eye as she watched a little screen blink on with a bio of what
looked to be a spirt.
