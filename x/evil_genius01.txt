	Washu was sitting idle in her lab thinking about herself and her place in the world. 
She was centuries old, and she had experienced love, hate, and everything in between. 
She was even a mother once, not like she was with Ryoko, but a real mother. Her child 
had long since grown old and passed away, but she had no real regrets about life, and 
her future seemed ever bright. But there was a longing inside her, a feeling that she 
could not yet explain. But for now she would forget about her confusing emotions and 
return her focus onto the one thing she truly loved above all else: Science! She was 
indeed the greatest scientific genius in the universe. Her knowledge of the inner 
workings of space and time was rivaled by no one, and she has never come across a 
scientific challenge she could not meet. But was it enough?

	Inside his castle stronghold, sat a man who feared nothing, a man with unending 
determination to fulfill all his goals. He was a man of unsurpassed intellect; his mind was 
capable of almost all that could be imagined. He believed that he was the most 
powerful man who walked the earth, and he would one day achieve his greatest goal. 
He would one day remove all doubt in the world that he was the greatest scientific mind 
that there ever was, and then he would rule all.
His name was Dr. Doom.  He sat in castle Doom, brooding, always concocting a plan 
that would rid the world of the accursed Reed Richards and his fabled Fantastic Four. 
But for now, it would have to wait; he would have to return his focus onto his 
obligations of both Lateveria, and Planet Doom. He had actually succeeded in 
achieving world domination, although it was a counter-earth that he ruled. A parallel 
planet, the same in almost every aspect as our own, only this one was devoid of the 
annoying "super-heroes" that would usually stand in his way. He ruled a planet, a 
country, and has gained complete superiority among his piers, but it wasn't enough for 
Doom.

	Washu yawned as she walked out of her lab to get some breakfast, she couldn't 
sleep a wink last night. She was so caught up in her new invention. It was a dimensional 
transportation destabilizer, or DTD for short. It would disrupt any kind of material 
transporting from one dimension to another on a grand scale. She had designed it 
incase something ever happened were she would have to take refuge in her lab, or just 
to keep out Mihoshi. Its design was simple enough, if a person were to try to teleport, 
or move, from one plane to a plane that was protected by the DTD they would get 
blocked, and sent back. It was impenetrable to anything. Not even she could force her 
way through it, if it came down to that. The only problem was that it was too powerful 
and that the effects of the field might have other unexpected effects on other transport 
fields. Basically if it were turned on it might just block some places that weren't 
intended to be blocked. So for now she would just leave it be and work on it later, but 
right now it was time for breakfast! 

Washu: " Sasami! Is breakfast ready yet?"

Sasami: " oh yes Washu it is, but you should have come earlier, everyone already ate."

Washu: " oh the burdens of science." she said as she sat down to eat.

Sasami: " actually I sent Mihoshi to go get you awhile ago, I wonder what's taking so 
long?"

Washu: " WHAT!!!  Mihoshi's in my lab!!" she spit out her food and rushed to her lab.

	Inside Washu's laboratory Mihoshi was looking at a brand new machine that Washu 
must've built recently. It was a funny looking thing with a massive satellite on top of it. 
Over the control panel was a sign that read: DTD, whatever you do don't push the red 
button!!"  

Mihoshi: " hmmm. I wonder if I should push the red button?" she thought to herself. " 
No, I won't, the sign said I shouldn't so I wont. Oh well I guess Washu isn't here, I'll 
just sit down and wait for her here." She turned and sat on the machine, pushing the 
button accidentally. " Oops." she said as the machine activated, and began to buzz. " 
oh no!" 

She started to franticly press buttons on the control panel hoping to shut it off, but 
instead, causing it to malfunction and break down. The machine started to smoke and 
spark, and Mihoshi jumped back to get away. It continued to buzz even louder and 
didn't seem to stop even though the controls weren't working. Just then Washu finally 
made it to her lab and found Mihoshi.

Washu: " What have you done?!?! You broke it, already! I can't believe it, you 
airhead!" yelled Washu.

Mihoshi: " I'm so sorry Miss Washu! I didn't mean to break it, I just sat down and it 
started to make noise and then I tried to stop it and it just got worse!" she was sobbing 
now.

Washu: " yeah, yeah, whatever! just get out of my lab!" she was shouting " and what 
did I say about calling me MISS!" she said angrily. 

	Mihoshi pouted and left, leaving Washu to fix the machine. It was too late however, 
and the damage had already been done, the DTD was activated. She only hoped that 
she could fix it before anything serious happened.

Victor Von Doom had finally finished his diplomatic endeavors in Lateveria, and was 
now able to return to Planet Doom. He had a transportation device that would take him 
to counter-earth, but this time when he turned it on, the field activated but he was not 
sent anywhere. Instead he remained in the same spot he was in before. 

Doom: WHAT! What is the meaning of this? Why is this not working?" he furiously 
exclaimed!

	He quickly went to his main consol to check the schematics, Doom being the Master 
of Science that he was soon found the cause of this annoyance. It was a strange force 
field blocking his movement to counter-earth.

Doom: " no doubt a new ploy developed by that accursed Richards, to keep me from 
my place of power." He said with the sound of loathing in his voice. " Hmmm. 
strange, the transmission doesn't seem to be coming from anywhere on the planet. In 
fact I can't even trace it to any recorded dimension that I'm aware of. Bizarre indeed, 
why would someone, or something, from another universe try to stop me from reaching 
Planet Doom? Whoever it is doesn't know whom they are dealing with! No one who 
ever crosses me gets away with it! They will soon learn to fear the name DOOM!" he 
roared with fury.

	Doom then continued his search for the cause of this transportation destabilization, 
when he found the exact transmission he recorded it and soon he located the specific 
coordinates of his new enemy. Using the Transmission as a light guiding him to the new 
dimension he plotted a course there. In haste he activated his transmat and was soon 
on his way.

     In her lab, Washu was trying desperately to turn off her machine without destroying 
it; after all it was her creation. After a few minutes she just gave up and blasted it to 
smithereens. If not for safety reasons, but to just shut it up. 

Washu: " Damn! I really didn't want to have to do that, when I get my hands on 
Mihoshi I'm going to." but before she could finish the thought alarms started 
sounding. According to her computer a massive technological force had just landed a 
few meters from the house. Generally around the carrot patch area, which is where 
Tenchi was!

	Tenchi was working on the carrot crops with Ryo-ohki on his shoulder, when 
suddenly a couple of feet in front of him a bright light flashed, and out of it stood the 
form of a man. He was wearing a green cape with a hood that covered him. Tenchi 
could not make out any features until the portal's lights faded, that's when he saw the 
iron faceplate that was hidden beneath the green hood. The man was also covered in 
what appeared to be a suit of armor from medieval Europe, only it was much more 
advanced and it covered his entire body. Over it he wore a green tunic with a black 
belt, and the buckle was shaped like the English letter D. He stood up and looked 
directly at Tenchi through the eye-slits in his metal mask, with a cold calculating look.

Doom: " Tell me boy, where am I?"

Tenchi: " o-Okyahma, Japan, on e-Earth." he said a bit intimidated.

Doom: " I see, so this is also a parallel dimension, much like my counter-earth.Boy 
tell me, is there anyone you know who has technological advancements or weaponry?" 
he said in a more demanding tone than an asking one.

"Washu" he thought to himself, but before he could respond to the man, Ryoko 
appeared next to them. She had been told of the "scary man in armor" by Ryo-ohki, 
and came right away.

Ryoko: " hey pal! You don't talk that way to Tenchi!"

Doom: " are you the one who brought me here? No, I can tell by just looking at you 
that you don't have the capacity for such an act. This is our first meeting woman, so I'll 
forgive you for your crude words, but I won't be so understanding again. Next time 
you will address me with respect!"

Ryoko: "address this!" she said as he threw her fist in Doom's direction!

Doom: "So quick to blows, I was obviously accurate in my observations about you, 
however I will not tolerate such an insult from subordinates!" he said as he moved to 
the side allowing her punch to wiz past him, then countering her attack with one of his 
own. He struck a pressure point in her abdomen, causing her to fall. "Learn this lesson, 
or prepare for execution!" 

Tenchi: " who do you think you are! That you can just come to our home and start 
ordering us around!"

 " Who do I think I am? Don't make me laugh, I am DOOM!"


                                                           THE END

Author's notes- there you have it, chapter 1 of my new crossover story. To any one 
who is not a fan of Marvel comics and just a TM fan that's okay, just try to pretend 
Dr. Dooms an original villain (he's not though, he's the proud creation of Stan "the 
Man" lee and the late great Jack "king" Kirby) and I'll try to explain more about him as 
the fic goes on. To people who are fans of the comic, I'm sorry but the FF will not 
make an appearance in this story, it's really more of a Washu V.S. Dr. Doom kinda 
thing. Well until next time true believers EXCELCIOR!!
