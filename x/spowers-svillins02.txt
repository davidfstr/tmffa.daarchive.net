CH2 Tenchi's Love

On board the Yagami "1st class detective Kiyone reporting yesterdays events sir"

"Kagato?  You say hmm I though he was dead.  Ill check into that, Now for your new 
assignment."

"New assignment sir?" asked Kiyone. 

"That's right.  We have had reports that the infamous criminal Ryoko is in you area.  You 
are to arrest her and bring her to headquarters for execution."

"Execution?  What is the charge? Sir I thought the statute of limitations ran out on her."

"Only the Juri statute of limitations ran out on Ryoko. As you should know the Galaxy 
Police has never had a statute of limitations, our policy is to bring justice no matter how 
long ago the crime was committed."

Kiyone slapped herself on the head "Of course how could I have forgotten.  But why is 
she to be executed?" 

"Under the revised edition of galactic law section 3 article 2.1 10 or more space raids is 
now punishable by death, and as a Galaxy police officer you a required to apprehend 
her."

"Yes sir," sighed Kiyone "Tenchi is not going to like this" she thought.  

***************************

A little while later:

Kiyone walks in the front door of the Masaki house everyone is just sitting down to eat.  
"Where are Washu and Dr. S?"

"I have not seen either of them since they went to Washu's lab this morning," said Tenchi.

"What could they be doing in there?" said Ryoko as Washu and Dr. S walked out of the 
lab.

"Thanks for showing me how to create alternate dimensions Washu"

"No problem Dr. S it was nice to talk to someone that can actually understand me.  The 
people around here are my friends and they are nice but they just don't understand me 
when I talk science."

"The food looks good I am starving," said Gohan. 

"Dig in," said Sasami.  At this Gohan started shoving food into his mouth as Sayians 
always do.  Everyone else at the table simply stared at him in disbelief sweat drops 
forming on the back of there heads.  Soon everyone started eating except Kiyone.

"What is wrong Kiyone?  You have not touched your food," said Sasami.

"I have some bad news," Kiyone started wondering how Tenchi would take it.  "When I 
gave my report to section chief he gave me and Mihoshi a new assignment."  Hearing this 
Mihoshi looked up.

"Does this mean we have to leave earth Kiyone?"

"No it is not that... it's about Ryoko.  Section chief said we were to arrest her and bring 
her in for execution."

"What!" said Ryoko food flying out of her mouth?

"What charge?  I thought the statute of limitations ran out on Ryoko," said Tenchi.

"Well it did, but"

"But what," yelled Ryoko

"But under the new revised law it has not run out," said Kiyone.  "It gets worse they 
know she is here no earth and if I don't bring her in they will send others to come look 
for her."

"Hmm I can't let them take my little Ryoko," said Washu.

"I agree Washu. I wont let them take you Ryoko," said Tenchi.

"Ill try to stall them till we can figure something out," said Kiyone.  Mihoshi nodded in 
agreement.

**************************** 

Back at GP headquarters in section chiefs office.  "Do you think Kiyone will bring Ryoko 
in?"

"I don't know... we better send a task force in just to be on the safe side.  Also check out 
Kiyone's Kagato report.  If Kagato is back there may be trouble."

**************************** 

Meanwhile Vegeta is standing where Capsule Corp headquarters is in his own dimension, 
but in this dimension there is only an empty lot at the edge of the city.  "Whomever did 
this wall pay!" yelled Vegeta clenching his fists while letting an energy wave radiate 
from himself damaging near by items.  

**************************** 

We now see the inside of Kagato's ship.  

"They thought they killed me the fools.  I can't believe even Washu fell for my act I 
would have thought she could tell the difference between my shadow and me.  No matter 
I now have all the power and Technology I need to rule the universe.  With my new 
invention I can control anyone who has an evil hart.  The test with Debura proved that it 
works.  To bad those two people came out of no ware and stopped killer, they were very 
powerful.  I must discover who they were."

***********************

At the Masaki house Ryoko is moping around.  "Why me?  First Kagato comes back and 
now I find out the Galaxy Police are after me."

"Well Ryoko maybe you should leave earth while you still can.  I'll take good care of 
Tenchi for you."

"In your dreams Ayeka.  You are not going to get rid of me that easy."  In walks Dr. S

"I'm not sure how this all works but Ayeka can't you get your dad to pardon Ryoko since 
he is the king of Juri?"  Ryoko looked at Ayeka hope in her eyes.

"No I am afraid I can not get my dad to pardon Ryoko.  People can only be pardoned if 
they are Juri citizens, and then since this is a GP case they could only be pardoned if they 
are a member of the Juri royal family, like me, Sasami, or lord Yosho."  Hearing this 
Ryoko's face changed from hope back to sadness.

************************* 
Meanwhile in Washu's lab Gohan was hooked to some sort of machine.

"Tanks for letting me try my new energy meter on you Gohan.  Now charge up to full 
power and lets begin," said Washu.

"No problem," said Gohan while beginning his transformation to a level of power beyond 
that of a Super Sayian.  Sparks started to fly from Washu's machines.

"What's going on?  This is not possible you power is off the chart."  Washu did not 
notice the sparks coming from here machines.  Then boom.  A thundering roar rolled 
through the lab as the machines exploded from and energy overload.  The only 
undamaged item was the table Gohan was strapped to.  Washu blocked the effects with 
her pink energy shield.  "You are strong Gohan.  I have never seen a living creature 
contain so much power.  You are probably as powerful as my Tachion Ray."  Tenchi 
burst through the door to Washu's smoke filled lab.

"What is going on in here that explosion shook the whole house."  Tenchi noticed Gohan 
was strapped to the same table he had been strapped to earlier when she tried the angle of 
mercy routine on him (a sweat drop formed on the back of his head).  "I sure and glad 
that is no me strapped to that machine" thought Tenchi.  "What are you two doing in here 
anyway?" asked Tenchi

"I was just checking Gohan's strength, and he was to strong for my machine."

"I see." Said Tenchi.  At that moment Dr. S walked through the wall like a ghost 
unaffected by the shield Washu had around the lab.

"Hmm" he said pulling a palm to PC out of his pocket and writing something down.  
"Washu I came to ask if I could use your lab for a moment to reconfigure my levitation 
boots, but I see your lab is a bit messy now, I will come back latter."

********************

At the edge of the solar system 5 galaxy police ships come into view.  "Sir we are at the 
edge of the solar system now.  Should we proceed to earth?"

"Yes captain.  You are to proceed to earth and capture the space pirate Ryoko.  Use any 
means necessary.  You have 5 special ops people at your disposal."

"Very well.  I will tell the squad to proceed at one to the third planet in the solar system 
known as earth.  Attention all ships this is caption Sharp of the GP ship united.  Your 
orders are to go to the planet earth and capture the space pirate Ryoko.  Move out and 
good luck."

******************

Meanwhile back on earth Ryoko was on the roof of the house thinking over what Kiyone 
and Ayeka had said to her earlier.  "Maybe Ayeka is right," she thought.  "Maybe I 
should leave this planet so I don't cause Tenchi any more trouble," she said to no one in 
particular.

"No Ryoko you should not leave," said a voice behind her.  Ryoko turner around to see 
Tenchi standing there on the roof looking down at her concern in his brown eyes.

"Tenchi," started Ryoko, but Tenchi cut her off.

"There is no need to say anything Ryoko.  I know how you feel about me, and I know 
how I feel about you.  I should have said something sooner but I was too scared too.  
Ryoko I love you, and I will stand by you with all my power to protect you."  Ryoko felt 
her heart race.

"O Tenchi," she said teleporting over to him rapping her arms around him.  "You don't 
know how long I have waited to hear you say those words."  Tenchi turned red as he felt 
Ryoko's body press against his own.

***************************

Back in the house Ayeka was gritting her teeth and staring and the roof.  "What is Ryoko 
doing to lord Tenchi?  I can't stand that woman always trying to seduce Tenchi like that."

"What are you doing Ayeka?" asked Sasami in her normal curious voice.

"It's none of your business Sasami," growled Ayeka.

***************************

At the shrine Yosho was staring up at the stars.  He could not remember when the last 
time was that he had looked at them.  He noticed a shooting start in the sky.  "How 
beautiful the sky is he thought."  Then he realized something was not right what he 
thought was a shooing start was coming towards earth.  As it drew closer he could tell it 
was headed for the house.  Soon four more of this "shooting stars" appeared in the sky all 
heading for his house.

**************************

 "Sir we have entered the earth's atmosphere and are heading toward the last reported 
sighting of Ryoko.  I believe it is Tenchi Masaki's house."

"Very well caption, as you know Tenchi is the one who defeated Kagato and freed 
professor Washu try not to hurt him or his house."

"I will instruct my men accordingly sir end transmission."

In the section chiefs office.  "I hope they don't get Tenchi mad at us he could prove to be 
a very valuable ally seeing how he is somehow related to the Juri royal family."

**********************

Tenchi and Ryoko were still on the roof when they too noticed the objects that looked 
like shooting stars.  They watched the stars for a while Ryoko still hugging Tenchi.  
Suddenly Tenchi felt her body tense "what is wrong Ryoko?"

"Those are no shooting stars Tenchi they are GP space ships.  They are already coming 
for me.  Lets get off this roof."

"Right," nodded Tenchi in agreement as Ryoko teleported them into the dining room.  

"I must go see Washu."  Ryoko walked over to the lab door opened it stepped in and 
disappeared.  Tenchi stood by himself for a minute then followed.  "Washu," called 
Ryoko "where are you?"

"Over hear Ryoko."  called the pink-hared scientist she had just finished cleaning up after 
the explosion earlier.  "If you have come to tell me about the GP space ships I already 
know."

"What are we going to do?" said Tenchi.

"We wait of course.  Dr. S has already gone to see how powerful these people are."

"Dr. S?"

"Well as you know he can move through anything kind of like you Ryoko, except he can 
also pass through energy shields and he can become invisible if need be.  So naturally he 
was perfect to spy on the GP force.  I told you he would be useful to keep around."  Then 
Dr. S walked over to them seemly out of nowhere as he came through the wall.  "O ya I 
forgot to mention I gave him a little device that allows him to create dimensional rifts."

"How many are there Dr. S?"  asked Ryoko.

"I saw five men.  They appear to be some sort of elite group.  If I could not dematerialize 
I would not be here right now.  When they caught me spying on them it was not a pretty 
sight."  Then turning to Washu "I got everything on tape just as you asked me to.  By the 
way this dimensional rift creator is really neat to bad I have to materialize to use it."  At 
the complement Washu smiled.

"It's nothing really," she said running her hand through her hair.  "Back to the matter at 
hand lets watch the tape."  Washu's ethereal computer appeared before her with the 
encrypted language on the screen that she thought only she could read.  She typed in a 
few commands and projector appeared next to her, and a screen farther away in the lab.  
Washu then took the tape from Dr. S and put it in the projector pressing play.  Kiyone 
walked up behind the group watching the tape just as it got to the Special Ops GP team.  
She was holding a cup of tea but quickly dropped it.

"Are they here?" she crocked.

"MmmHmm" said Washu.  "Can you tell us anything about them?"

"If they are after Ryoko we are in big trouble.  That is special ops team Blood they have 
never failed to get their man or Woman yet.  They are very well trained, they have the 
best technology the GP has to offer, and they all belong to the ancient order of the golden 
dragon."

"Just great" said Ryoko "why couldn't they send some normal people after me."

"Don't worry Ryoko we are here for you," said Tenchi placing his had on her shoulder.  
It made her feel a little better yet at the same time worse because after she finally got 
Tenchi he was now being threatened by a force that could separate them.

"Ok you two," said Washu looking at Ryoko and Tenchi shouldn't we be getting ready 
for these guys.

"Right" said Tenchi  "Where is Gohan maybe he can help after all we have seen how 
powerful he is."

"He left to go find his friend Vegeta," said Washu,  "and Kiyone and Mihoshi were called 
away by there chief." 

"Looks like it is just us then"

"Don't forget about me.  I may not be able to attack but I can spy.  Also since they can 
not hurt me as long as I stay dematerialized it won't matter if they catch me." Said Dr. S.

*************************** 

A few hours later.

"Here they come." Said Dr. S into the portable transmitter Washu gave him.  Then he 
stepped out of hiding right in front of the elite group of special ops men.  "Umm excuse 
me what are you doing here he asked."

"Freeze you are under arrest."

"What for?" asked Dr. S stepping close.

"He is coming to close open fire" Soon the dark sky was light up as the 5 special ops 
people opened fire on Dr. S with there ultra powerful blasters.  The light was blinding 
and none of them could tell if they had hit their target.  "Hold you fire men" They 
stopped shooting.  It took a while for their eyes to readjust to the night but when they did 
they noticed Dr. S was still standing their untouched.

"What was that for?" asked Dr. S acting completely innocent.

"Get him men."  Yelled the commander.  Two of the special ops people pulled out 
weapons that appeared to be red tridents.  They began walking towards Dr S.  At the 
same time 2 of the others slipped into the shadows to go around the back of the house.

"They are coming in the back aid Dr S into the transmitter I can stall them no longer."  
Then he disappeared.

"Hu were did he go?  He just vanished."  The two special ops men from team Blood 
slipped into the back of the house like phantoms.  They moved through the darkened 
interior of the house without a sound.  Washu was in here lab monitoring the activities 
when Dr. S materialized by her side.

"How is it going Washu?"

"Not good.  Ryoko look out they are right behind you."

Ryoko was in the kitchen waiting for team Blood in the front door when she heard 
Washu's warning.  She spun around with her light sword in her hand.  She lashed out but 
the special ops men easily blocked her.  At the same time the other three team members 
rushed in the front door of the house, only too meet Tenchi standing there ready with 
sword Tenchi.  He slashed the air in front of them but they blocked.

"Tenchi, we are special ops team Blood of the galaxy police we mean you no harm put 
down your weapon.  We are here for Ryoko."

"No I cant she is in my house she is my guest and you cant take her," said Tenchi 
slashing out at the guards again.

"I did not want to do this but you leave me no choice." Said the special ops man.  Tenchi 
saw a blue flash. From the corner of his eye but it was to late.  He was trapped in a magic 
force field much like the one Ayeka had.  Tenchi could do nothing now.

"I command you to stop this at once."  Everyone paused to look where the voice came 
from it was Ayeka, with Sasami standing beside her.

"We have direct orders princess Ayeka you are not to interfere," said one of the special 
ops people as he threw what looked like a miniature black hole at Ayeka.  She and 
Sasami both disappeared in a flash.

"Ayeka" yelled Ryoko "you monster what did you do to her."  She called forth one of her 
daemons and sent it loose at team Blood.  It slashed at one of the team members with its 
sharp claws knocking him unconscious.  At the same time 3 special ops men pounced on 
Ryoko.  "Tenchi" she cried.  They were too much for her to handle and they quickly had 
her subdued.

"Sir we have the space pirate Ryoko.  Send a transport ship immediately."  The special 
ops man then turned to Tenchi we must leave you know once we are gone you will be 
released."  He then pushed a button on his wristband and all the special ops people 
including Ryoko disappeared.  At the same time Washu cam running in.

"Washu what did they do with Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sasami?" asked Tenchi.

"I am afraid they took Ryoko to GP headquarters for trial and execution" she said sadly 
"there was nothing I could do.  As for Ayeka and Sasami I tracked them they were 
teleported to Juri."  At this same moment Kiyone and Mihoshi burst in the front door.  

"What is going on did they come already." Asked Kiyone.

"I am afraid so." Said Washu

"We must go Ryoko said Tenchi I must find a way to help her.  As for Ayeka and Sasami 
since they are back on Juri I am sure they will be safe for now."

"We will take Yagami," said Kiyone "come on we have no time to spare.  The GP will 
put Ryoko on trial right away."  Kiyone rushed out the door Mihoshi followed.

"Wait for me Kiyone" she called.

"Lets go," said Tenchi running out he door Washu followed him.  Yosho was up at the 
shrine when he noticed all the commotion and decided to come she what it was.  He 
nearly crashed into Tenchi.

"What is wrong Tenchi?"

"They took Ryoko I have to save her."

"I see then I shall come with you."

***************************
A little while latter on board the Yagami.

"GP headquarters this is 1st class detective Kiyone onboard the Yagami requesting 
permission to dock."

"Permission granted.  Dock at bay 20."

"Here we are every one follow me I will take you right to the trial area." Said Kiyone.  
Soon they were running down the halls of GP headquarters.  "Here it is said Kiyone" 
motioning to a door at the end of a hallway.  They entered and saw on the upcoming trial 
board that Ryoko's trial was scheduled in 3 hours.

**************************** 

Meanwhile in a Cellblock sat Ryoko all alone crying softly on the cheap bed.

"Tenchi why did it have to end like this?" she whimpered.  Then she heard her name.  A 
familiar voice was calling her.

"Ryoko."  She looked up standing on the outside of her cell door was Tenchi.  "Kiyone 
brought me here.  Washu and Yosho are also here."

"O Tenchi why does it have to end like this?" she said tears running down her face.

"It is not going to end like this Ryoko I promise.  Don't you worry."  His words were 
comforting to her.  Then a guard came up to Tenchi and pulled him away visiting hours 
are over he said as he rather roughly shoved Tenchi down the hallway.

Ryoko was again left all alone. Then she saw Dr S walk trough the door of her cell as if it 
did not exist.

"I'm here Ryoko," said Dr. S.  "I know I we don't know each other very well but Tenchi 
thought it would be best if at leas one of us could be here with you."

"Thanks Dr. S" she sobbed.

***************************** 

3 hours latter in the court room Ryoko was brought in.  The judge began.

"Space Pirate Ryoko you are brought here today to pay for your crimes against humanity 
across the entire universe.  You are charged with destruction of at least 100 ships and 
multiple bank robberies beyond witch can even be counted.  It is the decision of this court 
in accordance with Galactic standard law that you be put to death."  

All Ryoko could do was sob at the desk where all the defendants sat.  Seeing this the 
judge was about to hit his bench with the gavel thus making the ruling official when 
Tenchi stood up.

"Wait!"  The judge stopped sat down his gavel and looked at Tenchi he thought the boy 
looked familiar but could not quite place him. 

"What is it boy?"

"You honor I know Ryoko did some bad things in the past but she was under Kagato's 
power, the same Kagato I killed."

"So you're the boy who killed Kagato and set professor Washu free.  I have wanted to 
meet you.  Let me finish my ruling and then we can talk about how you did it."  The 
judge went to hit the gavel on the bench again.  Just when it was about to hit the bench it 
disappeared out of his hand.  Washu was holding the gavel in her hand then.

"Tenchi was not finished judge.  It would be terribly rude of you to cut him off like that." 
Said Washu.  The judge looked a little mad but seeing it was Washu holding the gavel he 
gave in.

"Ok boy what can you say or do that could possibly change this verdict?"

"I can do this." Said Tenchi pulling a small velvet box out of his pocket. Here is goes 
Tenchi it's now or never you can do it Tenchi he thought.  Tenchi then walked to the 
front of the court.  Ryoko looked up to see Tenchi standing before her.  "Cheer up Ryoko.  
I umm... well I did not want to tell you like this but um...."

"Get on with it boy," snarled the judge his patients was running thin.

"Well I wanted to wait until the perfect time but well this is my last t chance so here it 
goes."  Ryoko thought she knew what he was going to say and her heart started racing.
"Ryoko I love you."  Everyone stared in disbelief at this especially the judge.

"I love you to Tenchi."

"Very touching but this makes no difference.  Now Washu if you will return my Gavel."  

"Wait I am not done" he opened the box inside was a gold ring.  "Ryoko will you marry 
me."

"O Tenchi of course I will."

"This makes no difference," said the judge now loosing his temper.

"Actually it does" came a voice from the back of the room.  Everyone turned and looked 
to see who it was.  The voice was that of Yosho.  "Since they are now engaged to be 
married Ryoko is a member of Tenchi and my family." he continued.

"So that still makes no difference," said the judge Yosho then removed his mask of old 
age.

"I am lord Yosho of Juri.  Tenchi is my grandson also of the Juri royal family.  Now 
Tenchi has chosen to marry Ryoko.  That makes her a member of the Juri royal family.  
And as such I have the power as the King of Juri's son to pardon her of all her crimes.  
Ryoko please stand.  I herby pardon you of all your crimes and start you with a clean 
slate as my granddaughter in law."  The judge looked shocked.  Ryoko jumped up for joy 
and hugged Tenchi.  Washu smiled as did Yosho at the joy that came to Tenchi and 
Ryoko.  Tenchi could hardly believe what he was hearing.

"In light of this Ryoko you are hear by cleared of all charges and upon confirmation that 
this man is really who he says he is you will be free to go.  Until then you can leave your 
cell but may not leave GP headquarters."

"Tenchi I am so happy.  I have waited for this moment so long."  Yosho, Washu, Kiyone 
and Mihoshi walked over to Tenchi and Ryoko.

"I am proud of you Tenchi you have finally chosen between Ayeka and Ryoko," said 
Yosho

"Good job Tenchi but don't you think you cut it kind of close?  If you had been a little 
latter my little Ryoko would not be here now." said Washu.  By this time Tenchi was 
turning really red in the face.

"When we get home Tenchi and you father finds out I am sure he will want to throw you 
a large party," said Yosho.  "Lets not keep him waiting."

*********************** 

Latter that night.  

"Well I guess it is time to go to bed," said Tenchi.

"Already?  It seams like only a few minutes ago we got engaged."  Tenchi was just 
climbing into bed in a hotel room at GP headquarters when he sensed another person in 
his room.  He turned to see Ryoko with a look of mischief in her yellow eyes.

"Umm Ryoko what are you doing in my room?"

"Well now Tenchi we are engaged" she said smiling at him.  Ryoko walked over to 
Tenchi and wrapped her arms around him.  "You tired Tenchi?  If your not I can think of 
a way to tire you out now that we are engaged."  Tenchi turned red in the face.  "Come 
now Tenchi it's only natural to do this and that with the person you're engaged to."

************************ 

A few days latter back on earth.

"Dad we are home," yelled Tenchi as he walked through the front door.

"I see you managed to get Ryoko back."  Just then he noticed the ring on Ryoko's finger.  
"Tenchi did you two get married?"

"Well kind of we are engaged."

"Well done my boy.  I knew it would only be a matter of time before you chose one.  We 
need to throw a big party for you two, but I don't want to keep you up to late.  I mean you 
might want some time in your room alone if you know what I mean."

"Dad!" 

"I know your mother would be very proud of you Tenchi," continued Noboyuki ignoring 
his son's obvious embarrassment.  "By the way where is Ayeka?"

"She is still back on Juri with Sasami," said Yosho walking into the room.  Suddenly 
Tenchi got a worried look on his face.

"How am I going to break this to Ayeka.  I love you Ryoko and I am not going to hide it 
any longer, but I don't want to hurt Ayeka."

"Tenchi as much as I fight with her I don't want to hurt her either.  Over these past years 
we have become friends her and I."

"You to will think of something," said Washu walking towards her lab.

************************* 

Meanwhile back in Kagato's ship.

"The fools have already forgotten about me.  I will bide my time, then when the perfect 
opportunity presents itself I shall strike."
