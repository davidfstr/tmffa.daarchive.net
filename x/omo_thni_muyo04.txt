Vegean: Hey you can't do that!
Tenchi: mmm. and what if I win.?

Ron: {appears in the scene with his crew.} Are you ready to loose 
Tenchi?
Tenchi: .
Othni: Uh? You again. what are you doing here anyway?
Ron: Tenchi and I made a deal. and since you guys are such losers I'll 
win. and the prize is Kid-san, she will be on our team.
Othni: WHAT!? {look at Kid} Isn't true right? {She look at the floor in 
sadness} Why? Why you did this. Tenchi-sempai! How cold you.
Tenchi:..
Othni: I won't aloud it. There is no deal.
Ron: Sorry kid. you're late. and she accepted.
Othni: What!!?? Why you accept Kid?
Kid: because I believe in you. I believe you will win.
Othni: {in shock} . Kid-san. ok. I know I will since you say so.
Ron: Dream on haha. You'll never win.
Kid: You're wrong. {She looks mad.}
Ron: uh?
Kid: Othni-san will win. I know for sure. Because Othni-san has a kind 
and pure heart that burn with honor heats. And I know the goddess of 
victory smiles toward those who had that kind of burn.
Schala: {look at her sister} ...
Kid: And people like you, which only have the ambition of winning. will 
not be aloud to do so. I have faith in Othni-san. and I know for sure he 
will win.
Othni: . Kid-san.

saying} Goddess of victory? Burning hearts.? Ha don't make me laugh.
Tenchi: .. {then glance at Kid and smile.} .
Kid: {glance at Tenchi} Tenchi-san. I'll thank you for you kindness. and 
I know Othni will win.
Tenchi:. I know. that's why I accept and make the price higher for us. 
{Grins and walks away.}
Othnielys: Well I hope you win bro. I'll see you on the finish line. 
{She goes away too.}
Vegean: Are you ready to win kid?
Othni: Of course! And I know I'll win. Tell me who has three goddesses 
on his side? If The goddess says I'll win I believe. Because I have you 
Kid. {She smile} And Vegean. {she gives him a thumbs up} And now Schala. 
{She only look in a shy way.} I know I'll win!
Kid: That's why I love you Othni-san!!! {She hugs him and Othni blush 
furiously.}

Change Scene: It was time to race and Othni was on his place.

Othni was on the exit, while everyone arrives to the waiting spot. 
Schala was sad, because she upgrade Ron's car to make him win and make 
Kid come back to her, but she never wanted to ends up this way. Now she 
wishes she didn't make the upgrade. In the other hand, Kid unites her 
hands and closes her eyes. She was making a pray. Schala saw this and 
she got even depress. The cars were on position and the lights were on.

The red light change to yellow and then green, then both cars were 
thrown away by the force of power in their engines. Othni accelerates 
his Mazda changing to second, third, fourth and fifth arriving the 
100MPH. Ron just laugh and press the nitro button and the Supra pass him 
like lighting speed. Othni curse and press his nitro button trying to 
arrive on Ron's side. But With the nitro, still he was 15 seconds back. 
The finish line was getting close and it seems Ron was going to win. But 
suddenly, a mini explosion in his engine appears and the car was 
throwing smoke, his speed was reducing furiously. Othni take this 
advantage and press the nitro again passing at lighting speed to it's 
side and win the upper hand and pass the finish line. Othni's Mazda wins 
by 20 seconds. Othni hit the brakes and the Mazda stop in a great 
shocking of wheels and in a half spin. Everyone made a loud cheer. Ron 
stops and curses his luck.

Ryoko and Ayeka: //AND THE FURINHAN'S MOTOR CROSS CLUB WINS THE 
RACE!!!!!//

Everyone of Othni's crew jumps in victory and cheers. Kid was very happy 
and Schala made a 'sigh' and then smile a little bit. Then everyone runs 
at Othni who was getting out of the Mazda to congratulate him. Kid and 
Othnielys gave him a big hug while everyone surrounds them. Then Kid 
kisses Othni in his chick by then Haku and Yume raise him on their 
shoulders taking him away in victory. Tenchi in other hand was smiling 
happily, he knew Othni could do it. So then he went to Ron to claim his 
price.

Tenchi: I want all my stuff in my club tomorrow afternoon got it?
Ron: {curses under his breath} gnwkwuydbak ok. I will. a deal is a deal.
Tenchi: Great. C-ya Ron. {Goes away grinning in victory.}

The Motor Cross Club of Othni was on their tent celebrating their first 
victory in years. They splashed Othni with drinks of the cooler and 
throw on him ice and cold water. Othni got freezed but then he was back 
to normal.

Change scene: Later in that afternoon, walking on the street to the 
parking lot so they can go back home.

Othni, Kid, Vegean, Schala, Othnielys and Josue were walking on the 
Racetrack's streets to the parking. When suddenly they pass beside a 
julery shop that was there. Kid saw all the rings and earrings and other 
stuff. She was impressed and went there to see them. Then the other 
arrives at her side. Othnielys got her eyes with stars too.

Othnielys: Sugoi!!

Kid: Mmm. yes. well if is not a problem.
Othni: Not at all. this is our victory day remember n_n.  So wich one

Kid: Those earrings looks beautiful, I wish to have those please.
Othni: ok! No prob. {Then he starts looking to his wallet.} Shimatta. 
{still looking and don't find it, everyone starts to look at him with a 
dumb face and a sweat drop.} I can't find my wallet! I must have left it 
on my other uniform!! {Everyone face fault, but stands again with a 
sweat drop. Othni looked with sadness toward the floor.}
Vegean:. You can't even buy a girl some earrings. {Othni looked down 
even depress} What a stupid kid. {Everyone else was with a big sweat 
drop.}
Schala: {gets angry} gggrrr. you are a brainhead-baka! {Everyone looks
