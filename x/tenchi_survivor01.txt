                                        ---------------

In Washu's subspace lab Washu was making a very-very fun plan for the
summer.  Ayeka and Ryoko were fighting (as usual)  Tenchi got a
record. only 5 nosebleeds :)  Anyway Washu wanted to have a ve-ry fun
summer so she made a special island. To have a compition.  She would
ask all the fans of Tenchi Muyo to vote someone "off the island"
HEHE she thought.  I wonder if it will work!!

NEXT DAY!!

"YES" i got it Washu said with a very pleasant voice.
"UMM Washu what is that?"
"Oh, hi Ten-chi!"
"We're gonna have a fun summer!!"
Washu got all her fellow Tenchi Characters to come to the Masaki
Household.  The people include...

Tenchi

Ayeka
Sasami
Mihoshi
Kiyone
Nobuyki
Yousho
Achika

said.  Wonder whats to eat...
Tenchi went around the island looking for a house.  "WHAT! NO place
to live!!??"  HMM....

Ryoko rounded the corner looking for tenchi.  She quickly found Ayeka
who jumped at her.

"What were you doing!" Ayeka screamed.
"I dunno"
"Of course you don't" "never do either" Ayeka said to herself.
"Fine, lets agree on something!" Ryoko suggested "Let's both find
