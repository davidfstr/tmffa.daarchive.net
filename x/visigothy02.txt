Authors Notes: I think I'll start my disclaimer now. Tenchi is owned by AIC
and
Pioneer. MIB is owned by some other company and Sailor Moon is owned
by........
um I have no idea. Well they aren't owned by me in any way. I only
minipulate them
to suit my own needs. Haven Ironhead, Khaine Visigothy and any other made up

characters of my own creation are mine and using them will flatter me to no
end. This
will be my fourth fan fic and I still can't find my others on the site yet
but im not
worried, because soon i'll be god. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA...ha.

Chapter 2

Shadow waited in the alley way looking around him. Making sure no one
was watching him. He closed his eyes for a minute, then suddenly he could
feel that
static shock he always got when he turned invisible. Most of his race didn't
get that
high he got when they became invisible. He was avoran and proud of it.
He strolled over to the large white building with one purpose in mind. To
get what he came for. He waited for someone to open the door and slipped in
before
they could realize he was there. He followed the man and woman in there
black attire
into the elevator and stood behind them. When the doors opened behind him
they
almost ran into him but quickly reacting he got out of there way. This is
too easy.
he thought to himself as he stepped into the heart of MIB headquarters.
He took a quick glance around taking in the scene of other extra
alien'species checking in at the desks. After a few minutes he headed toward
one of
the doors that led to the huge corridors that made up the headquarters
stopping
every so once in a while to stick an explosive in a hiding place. Sometimes
he had to
go to one side so no one would detect his presence.
After choosing a random door he could feel his mouth creep into a smile.
Looking around he could see all the diffrent kinds of fighters, transports
and ground
vehicles MIB had at disposal. He stopped to admire one of the black x-shaped
fighters before he began to stick explosives in every hiding place
concievable and
moved on out of the hanger and back into the corridors. Easy as pie as the
natives
would say it. he thought to himself as he let a slight chuckle escape his
lips.

Dog was on his black hummer trying desperately too search the alien
races data base but wasn't coming up with any matches. Ryoko was sitting on
the
bottom of the steps that led up to the shrine. She was obviously bored and
had wanted
to stay with Tenchi until he recovered and longer still. She got up and
paced a little
before she let out a growl. " Are you done yet."
Dog ignored and began to sing along with the Led Zeppelin song that was
blaring out of his vehicle. After a few minutes Ryoko pointed her hand at
the hummer
getting his attention as glowing red energy ball formed in hand. "Hey, don't
do that."
He pulled out his gun and out of shere luck he blasted the ball of energy
causing an
explosion that knocked him of his feet.
"Well, are you going to answer me now?" Ryoko said as she dusted
herself off.
Dog got up not bother to dust himself off and pointed his oversized hand
blaster at her. "If you do that again, personal force field or no, im going
to fire a shot
right between your eyes." Dog lowered his gun and then scratched the
stubbles on
his chin. "And the answer to your question is to the computer your so called
goatmen
don't exist."
"Well, they felt pretty real to me." Ryoko snapped as she ran her fingers
through he spiky cyan colored hair.
Dog looked around for his laptop and found its shattered remains on the
ground. As he was picking the pieces up he realized the music stopped and
left the
broken lap top on the ground and walked to the driver side door and looked
in. The
whole interior either burnt or still burning. "Great, that was my one of my
favorite
cds, and you destroyed it." He was about to go on when he heard someone
runnning
down the steps.
Kiyone had her handblaster in both hands ready to use it when she
reached the bottom. "What happened, is everyone ok?" She asked as she
stopped
and looked around. Mihoshi then showed up next to her.
"Oh, my what happened here?" She asked as she looked around at the
scorched hummer and broken computer on the ground.
Dog walked up to Mihoshi with a sheepish grin on his face looking
Mihoshi up and down. "Hello mam, I'm agent Dog of MIB, Don't worry I have
this
situation under control now." As he said this he straightened up and tried
to flex his
muscles a little hoping it would impress the blonde detective.
Kiyone stepped in between them and stuck out her hand in greeting. "I'm
detective first class Kyone Makibi and this is my partner detective first
class
Mihoshi Kuramitsu." As she finished however agent Dog walked around her and
took Mihoshi's hand.
"Mihoshi eh, I like that name." As he said this he gave the back of her
hand a little kiss before continueing. "I've met a woman as stunning as you
miss
Kuramitsu."
Mihoshi had a blank look on her face. "Pleased to meet you too....I
guess." She shifted her attention to the scorched hummer and was about to
say some
thing when a voice from a tree interupted her.
"That was a cool explosion." Haven yelled down from his perch in a
branch over Mihoshi's head. "Didn't know you had such power Ryoko?"
"It's just one of my many talents." Ryoko stated.
"Yeah well I shot her energy ball out of the air you know." Dog said
hoping to get a reaction out of Mihoshi.
He did but not the kind he was hoping for. "Thats nice." She said almost
as if it didn't impress her in the least. "Oh yeah, Ryoko it's dinner time,
Sasami sent
us to come get you two."
At this they headed toward the house. Dog walked behind the three girls
still looking Mihoshi over. As they walked ahead of him Ryoko whispered into

Mihoshi's ear. "I think the agent likes you."
"Really, he kind of gives me the creeps." As she said this Mihoshi looked
at the tall agent who smiled at her. She quickly turned her head back around
and
and hoped to herself that he wouldn't be sitting next to her.

Haven had finished his dinner early he headed out to the woods to think.
He walked as deep as he could and looked around. "Yeah, this will do." he
muttered
to himself. He sat down next to a big tree who seemed to be in its last
year. The
leaves were fally off and the bark was peeling. Haven closed his eyes and
began to
mutter more words to himself. "Where are you?"
As he finished a voice entered his head. "I'm right here, always with you
as your guide through this world." An image appeared in his mind of a large
grey
wolf. "You are looking for answers, you wish to find eagle and tiger."
"Yes, i do." Haven stated.
"You won't find them this way, you must look to the stars."
"I just came from the stars, I found no answers."
"Look to the stars, young cub." And with this the wolf in his mind
disappeared only leaving him with more questions.
"How in the hell is that supposed to help!" Haven yelled.

Washu was down in her lab taking care of her two patients. Tenchi was up
and walking around now. He had finished his meal now and was in the mood to
work
in the fields. "Is it okay, Little Washu."
"Of course my little lab rat." Washu pronounced. "You're fit as a fiddle."
Tenchi gave Washu a smile and put his shirt back on. He got up and
glanced over at the woman laying in the other hospital bed tied down. Washu
had to
drug her again. The woman was like a firecracker and didn't act like any foe
he had
ever faced. She had seemed like she was a brave person.
When Tenchi left Washu went back to decrypt the communikay she
acquired from her patient and was still trying to tap into the signal she
was using. The
task had seemed even to her utterly hopeless. I can do this, I'm the
greatest scientific
genious in the universe. She thought to herself. "And besides, Haven would
think
there was no hope anymore if I failed him now."

Khaine stood on the bridge of his ship, looking out into the stars. He
grabbed a microphone and pressed a red button on its side. "Attention fleet,
I have
some words I would like to tell you." He paused just for amoment before he
spoke
again. "Our invasion time has been pushed forward. Before you enter the
field of
battle you must not underestimate your opponet." Khaine then took off his
sunglasses revealing steel cold blue eyes.
"I was once one of them and they will not back down just because we are
advanced. In fact any of thinking this is going to be easy isn't going to
survive this war, I'll tell you that." Khaine paused again letting his words
sink in. "But don't
worry too much, just fight."
After he was done he handed the microphone to Dark Flame. She grabbed
it and yelled into it. "All ground troops mobilize, it's time to conquer
earth!"
