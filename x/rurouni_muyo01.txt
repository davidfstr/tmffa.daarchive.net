Rurouni Muyo: Act 1 "No Need For A Handsome Samurai"
A multipart X-over Fanfic series
By: LiquidX - Suzuki17@hotmail.com

"Tenchi Muyo!" and characters were created by Hiroki Hayashi and Masaki 
Kajishima and are property of AIC/Pioneer. "Rurouni Kenshin" is the property of 
SPE Visual Works Inc., and "Samurai Shodown" is the property of SNK.   I do not 
own the characters, or the series.  I just write the fiction.

This takes place in the near beginning of the "Tenchi Muyo OVA series", and 
probably the full series of the "Rurouni Kenshin OVA", the middle of the Kenshin 
TV series (except the Hurogasa episode) and Samurai Showdown 4, since both 
Kenshin and Samurai Shodown have almost parallel timelines; it would be easy to 
fuse them together.

Meiji 11(1878) - Tokyo

 It had been a month since the event of the defeat of Hitokiri Shishio Makoto 
and his "Kuni Tori" (World Domination) plot, thwarted by the Hitokiri Battousai 
(Himura Kenshin), and Japan was at peace again except the normal crime of 
robbers and yakuza thugs.  Saitoh Hajime had returned to his police duties, and 
the rest of the Kenshin gang had returned back to the Kamiya Dojo from Kyoto.

It was a normal day for the gang, doing the chores that were needed after the 
incident and Kaoru and Yahiko had been practicing their kenjutsu, the Kamiya 
Kasshin Style, but Sanouske had still to do the repairs in the dojo, from his 
incident with Saitoh. And Kenshin was doing the laundry and babysitting Suzume 
and Ayame at the same time. After Kaoru and Yahiko's training ended, all of them 
decided to visit Kenshin.

[Kenshin] "All clean and white!"
[Ayame and Suzume] "All clean and white!"  "Ken-ni will you play with us again?"
[Kenshin] "In a while, right now its lunch"
[Kaoru] "What is for lunch today Kenshin?"
[Kenshin] "I can't think of anything today that is, why don't you cook today 
Kaoru-dono?"
[Kaoru] You like my cooking don't you Kenshin?  And I am beautiful too!"
[Kenshin] hahaha
[Yahiko] No, your cooking is bad and you are busu. Busu! Busu!"
[Kaoru (Angered)] Yahiko I'm gonna get you!

Kaoru chases after Yahiko for 5 minutes straight, then she starts cooking, and 
twenty minutes they start eating.

[Sanosuke (whispers)]  "Kenshin, is jo-chan's food from another world?"
[Kenshin (smiling)]  "No, I like her food, and she is getting better at it each 
time I think."

Everyone starts eating Kaoru's Food that she had cooked; soon they start having 
complaints about it.
[Kaoru (expecting an answer]  "How do you like my cooking? Hmmm"
[Ayame (pouting)] "Needs more salt"
[Suzume] "Too much spice"
[Yahiko]  "We are going through tough times, but we have to grin and bear it."
[Kaoru]  "How about you Sano?"
[Sano (look of disgust)]  "... Disgusting."

Kaoru starts throwing produce at Sano.  Sano dodges the things, and hides behind 
Kenshin.

[Kaoru (griping)]  "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE FREELOADING OFF OF ME?  IF YOU DON'T 
LIKE IT GO FIND SOMETHING ELSE!!"
[Sano]  "I don't have any money since I quit the fighter-for-hire job, and I 
have too much debt at the Akabeko so I have to eat here!"

Kaoru keeps throwing stuff at Sano, but everything hits Kenshin in the head.

[Kenshin (squealing)] "Orooroorrro!"

Three guests arrive at the Kamiya dojo, to tell the news to Kenshin.

[Police chief]  "Excuse us for our intrusion again, but we need to speak to 
Himura-dono."

[Kenshin (showing interest)] Please speak.

Kenshin begins to listen to the story that Yamagata is speaking and it had some 
become serious.

[Lord Yamagata] "Kenshin, thank you for dispatching Shishio in Kyoto kast month, 
but another situation has risen so quickly after one month of peace." (Seriously 
speaking)  "You may have not noticed this for a few days, but a mysterious 
castle had appeared five miles east from where you are right now, but that area 
had no castle there on the map nor it was on our historical records."  Yamagata 
points to the direction of where the castle is.  "I have a bad feeling about 
this, and I need your help again, for the nation is at stake again."

Kenshin and Sano look at the direction of where Yamagata is pointing.
[Kenshin] "Oro?"
[Sano (awed)] "What the hell is that!?!?"

The skies turn cloudy and dark from where the castle stands.

[Kenshin] Kenshin looks at it.
"This is bad, that it is, but I wish to have peace, therefore I will protect the 
people again, even if it costs my own life, Yamagata-san.  Sano come with me, 
for it may be bad news, and I know that you want to have a good fight or two."

[Sano (excited, cracking his knuckles)]  "You got it Kenshin! For I had learned 
something from you that I wish to fight for."

[Yamagata]  "Thank you both for choosing to help me to deal with the situation.  
You will be rewarded for your work.  I have asked officer Fujita Goro to aid you 
both with your journey there to rectify the situation."

Saitoh comes out into the open.
[Saitoh] "Hello again Hitokiri Battousai, Long time no see."

[Sano]  "Have you come here Saitoh-san to have another duel between Kenshin or 
I?  I want to get some payback for what you did to me back then!"

[Saitoh]  "Yare yare, how about your defense, has it improved the last time?  If 
not, maybe another time when you get more practice I maybe will fight you hand 
to hand again.  I was assigned to you again Kenshin, but I desire to have that 
duel with Kenshin still."

[Kaoru] Kenshin, I still want you to stay here with me, but I know this is 
inevitable.  Please come back to me again soon! (Sobs) I don't want to be alone 
again!"
Kaoru remembers the memory when she first met Kenshin.  "I don't know when I'll 
drift again, for I am a Rurouni."  Kaoru gives some medicine and a few bandages 
to Kenshin.

[Kaoru (sobbing)]  "That fox woman gave me these in case you leave again."

[Kenshin] "Don't worry Kaoru-dono I will return, for I have grown fond of it 
here, as if it were my home."

[Kaoru (happy)] "Thank you Kenshin."

Kenshin comes up to Yahiko.
[Kenshin (whispering)] "If something happens to me, grow strong in the Kamiya 
Kasshin Style, and protect."
Yahiko "sure Kenshin."

Kenshin, Sano, and Saitoh leave for their journey to investigate the incident.  
About a mile later Kenshin questions Saitoh about the castle.

[Kenshin] "Saitoh, just who are we dealing with?  With something as serious that 
it is, at least would you know something?"

[Saitoh] "Since this had happen a few days ago, I didn't have time to get the 
basics of who owns the castle.  I guess we would have to find out ourselves.  
I'd bet every samurai would come out of the woodwork to get to this."

A man comes out of the forest with interest after hearing Saitoh's remark.

[Samurai]  "I know something about that castle, I will tell you it but on one 
only condition."
Kenshin looks at the samurai that came out of the forest.  He had a weird hair 
look, spiky back overtone, and carries a katana and a sake bottle.

[Kenshin (surprised)] ORO? H.. Ha.. Haromaru?

[Sano] "Kenshin, do you know this guy?"

[Haromaru] "Long time no see Himura-san.  I hadn't seen you since the Bakumatsu 
days. What's up with you?  Are you still the Hitokiri(manslayer) that I knew 
when I was with the Ishin Shishi?"

[Kenshin] "I gave that up 10 years ago, now I live to protect the people.  So 
what's with you and what is your condition, that it is?"

[Haomaru] "I'm here to stop the guy who owns it, for now since that damn castle 
had appeared, the land wreaks of evil.  I want to join your little group, for I 
know that there are some who are going to stop us.

Kenshin thinks it over, since he knows that Haomaru is able to take care of 
himself in these situations, for he had fought along side Kenshin during the 
Ishin revolution.

[Kenshin] Come with us if you want, but don't stop us in where we are going, 
that it is.

[Haomaru]  "Thanks, since you had kept your end of the bargain, I will keep 
mine.  The person had escaped out of physical Hell, so he can take revenge for 
his death for I killed him once. His name is Zankuro."

Haomaru remembers when he had killed Zankuro, for he was a tough bastard.  
[Zankuro] "ONE DAY I WILL ESCAPE FROM HELL TO KILL YOU FOR REVENGE HAOMARU!"

[Saitoh]  "...Hmph, I remember someone by that name, and he had escaped hell 
huh?  If he is able to do that, he must be very strong, I wonder if he had 
anyone else escape with him.  I wonder if we have to fight Shishio Makoto 
again."

[Sano (laughing)] "Nah, he is probably doing Kuni-Tori in hell and he would not 
want to pass that up.  He must know someone else personal to do that job right."

[Kenshin (laughing)] "I hope so that it is"

[Haomaru]  "Wasn't Shishio your successor to be the Hitokiri after you left?"

[Kenshin]  The government had executed him, but he survived.  When I fought him 
a month ago, after fifteen minutes he combusted and died, enough said about him.  
Haomaru, can I have some of your sake?"

[Haomaru]  "Still the sake drinker huh?"  Haomaru unties the loop and passes the 
bottle over to Kenshin.  He drinks it up and finds it to be good.  He passes the 
bottle back to Haomaru.

[Kenshin]  "Man, this stuff is good, that is."
[Haomaru] "Nothing but the best for me."

After another mile to their destination another man crosses their path.

[Ninja]  "Ah, more Ishin police to kill (referring to Saitoh), but I want to get 
to my destination.  Nah, I want my revenge over the Ishin Shishi.

[Saitoh] "The rest of you go ahead of me, I want to talk to the Bakufu ninja.  I 
will catch up later."

The group did as commanded and left Saitoh.

[Saitoh]  So, we meet again Hanzo Hattori, are you still angry ten years ago 
because I was the Shinsen Gumi's Third Division Captain, and overpowered you?"

[Hanzo (surprised)]  SO, it is you, Saitoh Hajime.  Ahh the more fun it is now 
to kill you, for that and you sold yourself to the Ishin Police.  En Garde!"

Hanzo goes into his ninjutsu position, and Saitoh goes into his Gatotsu 
position.  Hanzo disappears and gets behind Hanzo, however Saitoh realizes this 
and makes a kick against him, it connects and sends him backward.  Hanzo 
recovers from this, and draws his sword.  He then charges against Saitoh and 
Saitoh blocks it and swings his katana against Hanzo, and it slices him.  Blood 
comes rushing out.  However, Hanzo is still kicking and throws a fireball 
against Saitoh, it hit and sends him backwards.

[Saitoh] "My have you improved over the years, but now it is time to finish 
this."

Saitoh gets up and goes back into his gatotsu position.  Hanzo charges again.
[Saitoh]  GATOTSU ZERO!!!

Saitoh's sword slices Hanzo from top to bottom, spraying blood on Saitoh.  The 
corpse splits in half, revealing Hanzo's gore.

[Saitoh] "What a waste of a Bakufu ninja, yare yare what will do with you."
Saitoh leaves the corpse, and walks to catch up with the group.
Another mile passed as the group was walking. The area flutters with sakura 
blossoms, however they made Kenshin remember Kaoru.
[Kenshin] Sano, if something should happen to me, give Kaoru-dono this.
Kenshin gets the letter out from his kimono, and gives it to Sano. Sano looks at 
it "To Kaoru" and puts it in his gee pocket.
[Sano] "Oro, what is this "if something should happen to me crap", it's as if 
you are going to die or something on me soon.  I don't want to hear that, but I 
will give it to her as you wish, I will do as you say.
[Kenshin] Arigato gosaimasu Sano.
[Sano] Whatever.
[Haomaru] Its as if you have a kanojo (girlfriend) or something.  Good luck with 
her.
[Kenshin] Arigato Haomaru.

As they were walking a quarter mile another man showed up in their path again, 
however he was very big and carried a ball chain necklace.
{Aku No San - Hyottoko's theme}
[Gaira]  I need to get there, but you are in my way.  WHO WILL I FIGHT TO 
ADVANCE TO MY GOAL?  I want to be able to make my claim on Zankuro and SHIRO 
AMAKUSA!
Sano looks at the guy with a smile as he cracks his knuckles.
[Sano] I'll take that offer!  Kenshin and Haomaru, LEAVE ME!.

The two leave Sano as expected.

[Sano] SO, what is your name so I'll remember you as the one who would be 
defeated by Sagara Sanouske?
[Gaira] You will remember me as Gaira as I am going to send you to HELL where 
you belong.  I will bury you right where you stand as my final memento to your 
defeat.  BRING IT ON!

Gaira Charges after Sano as Sano stands there and waits, then Gaira takes his 
cannonball sized necklace and swings it at Sano, however he catches it.  A 
struggle for the weapon had started.

[Gaira] You are very strong as I see it, maybe it won't be a boring battle after 
all.  Lets see what can you do with my necklace.
[Sano]  Yeah, same here.

It would appear that Sano has the advantage and rips the necklace from Gaira's 
hands, now Sano has the necklace and throws the necklace aside.

[Sano] Now you don't have a weapon you THIRD RATE UNDERLING! NOW IT'S MY TURN TO 
TEAR YOU APART!! FUTAE NO KIWAMI!

The fast punch hits Gaira in the head.  As it connects, Gaira staggers and falls 
to the ground, and spits up blood.  He is now unconscious.

[Sano] Now that was a good fight that I wanted in a long time.  Sorry but I need 
to catch up with Kenshin.
As Sano gains his victory over Gaira, he runs to catch up with him.

Kenshin and Haomaru have made the rest of the mile mark, a dead man rises up 
from the ground.

[Basara] Who disturbs my sleep at a time like this?  He looks around and sees 
the evil castle, Kenshin and Haomaru.
[Haomaru]  I'll take care of this zombie with a weapon.  Leave me Kenshin.
[Kenshin]  I have to take care of this alone now. I'll see you there at the 
place.

Kenshin leaves the place.
[Haomaru] So Basara, we meet again. Its time to finish the battle we had a long 
time ago, shall we?
[Basara] Yes Haomaru, I will be able to rest in peace after I rip you to shreds.
Haormaru draws his sword hand has it above his head, while Basara readies his 
large shuriken and chain.  Basara throws his weapon and Haomaru dodges by 
jumping over it, and does his attack in the air, it slices a deep cut into 
Basara. However Basara Disappears into the ground and does his secret shadow 
attack and grabs Haomaru and pulls Haomaru's legs down causing damage from the 
muscle pulling by his attack.  Haomaru jumps up and scratches the ground causing 
a whirlwind of dust to come at Basara.  Its sucks Basara in and throws him up to 
the air and drops to the ground causing major damage to him.  Haomaru makes the 
final move and slices him in half from the chest across.  Bones fling and 
rotting flesh fly as a result.
[Haomaru]  Victoly!  Catch up time!

Meanwhile in the evil castle:
[Zankuro]: Soon our revenge will begin, right Amakusa?
[Amakusa] Yes, since I had brought you back from the dead, we will begin our 
domination from the acts of the past, by conquering the future.  I wonder, who 
would be our first guest to arrive here.  Any guesses Kurogasa?
[Kurogasa] (evil grin) I hope it will be the one from the revolution, a man that 
killed many men of the Shinsen Gumi heheeheh. I WANT TO KILL HIMURA BATTOUSAI, 
the user of HITEN MITSURUGI RYU!
[Amakusa]  Well then, shall we begin the plan?
[Kurogasa] Let the battle of the future begin!

Amakusa gathers his evil power, and summons a time portal.  Kurogasa walks into 
the portal and the portal closes.  The only thing Amakusa does not know is where 
the year and the location. Zankuro is in awe of Kurogasa's power of shin no 
ippou and Amakusa's power.

As Kenshin nearly sees the destination clearer, he also sees what he does not 
want to look, another woman that looks severely injured, and a bird had been 
perched on her shoulder.  Kenshin runs towards the area she sees the woman 
unconscious.

[Mahahhara] Screech
[Kenshin] Are you okay, that is?
[woman] (softly) m..mmm..help me.

Kenshin remembers that he had medicine and bandges that Kaoru gave to him as a 
gift from Takani Megumi, the fox-woman apprentice of Dr.Gensai that also has 
interest in him, thinks that he should thank them both soon as he returns.  
Kenshin gets out the medicine and bandages and starts treating her wounds, 
twenty minutes later it is done. Sano and the rest finally manage to catch up 
with Kenshin.
[Sano] Oro, who did this woman in?
[Kenshin] I don't know who did this, I just found the woman in this condition. I 
had helped her the best as I can, that it is.
The girl regains consciousness.
[Nakoruru] Arigato for the help, Mr?  I am Nakoruru, and this is my pet hawk 
Mahahara (she looks at Kenshin with her glassy eyes)
[Kenshin] Himura Kenshin.  I have a question for you. Do you know of any of the 
people involved in this situation with this evil castle on the horizon?
[Saitoh] Any of that kind of information will be helpful, since you appear to be 
out of the picture in this one.
[Sano] Once this is over, I know a doctor that can patch you up in Tokyo, 5 
miles from here.
A crude thought came to Saitoh.  First he sees Kaoru as a tanooki girl, Megumi 
as a fox-woman, Misao as weasel girl, and now this Nakoruru as the hawk girl.
[Saitoh] (joking) So who is this Himura Battousai,  the hawk girl?
Nakoruru gets pissed.
[Nakoruru] Sic 'em Mahahara
The hawk takes off Nakoruru as a perch, starts flying right above Saitoh's Head 
and starts to grab on Saitoh's head, causing tension and blood loss from the 
bird.
[Kenshin] (chuckling) you still haven't learned what had happened the last time 
when you did that on Misao?
[Saitoh] (enraged) Get this bird off my head before it takes a crap on me!
[Nakoruru] Come Mahahara.
The hawk releases itself from Saitoh's head and perches back on Nakoruru.
[Nakoruru] Himura Battousai, the Himura Battousai from the Bakumatsu?
[Kenshin] That is what I once was, but now I'm a Rurouni that protects people.
[Nakoruru] I didn't know that you would be this charming.  The person that did 
me in was one of the three in that castle.  He has the smell of blood on him, 
just like he was freshly killing people left and right.  His name is Kurogasa.  
The other two people involved in this plot are Zankuro and Shirou Amakusa.
[Saitoh] Kurogasa!  The tainted blade of the Shinsen Gumi.  He had killed even 
our own men during the revolution, as well as the Ishin Shishi.  Damn that 
Hitokiri Udoh Jinei!
[Nakoruru] I guess you know him don't you?
[Haomaru]  I'll stand watch here.  You three go alone and finish this.
[Kenshin]  Gotcha.

As the three left to finish their task, Haomaru stands watch.
[Haomaru] what are your views of one of my old friends, Nakoruru?
[Nakoruru] I like him.  I hope he returns soon.

The three had made it to the castle.  The castle wreaks of death, bones are 
lying everywhere, and there is a strange green glow that emits from one of the 
windows.  It's as total chaos had emerged from a battle long past.
[Saitoh] This place is cursed from the evil here.
[Kenshin] I'll go in first.  Sano come in second, and Saitoh can go in last.

As Kenshin enters the castle, he starts to have memories of the Kamiya Dojo, of 
what had happened to make him both happy and angry, and his love for Kaoru. He 
makes it to the big room where the green light is emitting it from.  There he 
sees a woman with the strange green glow, as if it she were possessed by 
something.
{Kyoto E No Purodda}
[Amakusa] The red hair, the cross-shaped scar on his left cheek, and a sword to 
go with it too, none other than the Hitokiri Battousai.
[Kenshin] Who are you to be calling my name from the revolution, that is?
Kenshin stares at the man that pulsates with electricity with manslayer's eyes. 
The view of a purple face and a dark red robe tempts Kenshin to kill.
[Amakusa] I am Shirou Amakusa, and you are my next step to my plot.
"What plot" is what Kenshin thinks.
[Kenshin] And that is?
[Amakusa] My next step to conquer the world and the future.  I have been killed 
before by Haomaru from my previous battle with him.  I had escaped from hell and 
even Zankuro wanted to join in on my revenge plot. And doing so I had become 
strong.  The person who told me about you is Kurogasa, and of course being from 
hell, Shishio Makoto. All that is in my mind is power and revenge. Also, what 
would happen if there would be no Battousai to protect the people in this 
"Meiji" era?
[Kenshin] You wreak of evil, that is what you are.  Even I the Battousai didn't 
have this much in my entire life.  Therefore I will stop you, no matter what the 
cost.
Kenshin draws out his sakabatou.  Amakusa draws out his hand, as Kenshin sees 
it, little 8 black things come together to form a deep red orb with a lightning 
bolt inside the orb.
[Amakusa] Come evil power come, give me the strength to conquer my world.

Saitoh and Sano went up to where Kenshin is and they see as the battle begins.
[Kenshin] Don't come any closer.  This is mine.

{Amakusa's Battle theme}
Kenshin charges after Amakusa with his sakabatou in hand and runs to him.  
Amakusa throws a skull shaped fireball at Kenshin and Kenshin dodges by jumping 
over the ball and hits Amakusa with his sakabatou.
[Kenshin] How would you like a taste of the battoujutsu?
Kenshin sheathes his sword and prepares for his attack.
[Amakusa]  Very well known for your name.
Amakusa charges Kenshin and throws his retractable orb at him.  Kenshin makes 
the battoujutsu swing and misses because Amakusa had dodges it by going warp 
speed.  However Kenshin was ready to use his sheath, however this time the 
sheath hits Amakusa in the chest, as a result the pain becomes serious, muscles 
pull, and tendons rip due to the impact. Amakusa drops to the ground.
[Amakusa] NO THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
[Kenshin]  I have perfected the Battoujutsu in all ways during my training with 
Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu.  I am fully aware that my sakabatou is not perfect for 
making it.  That is why they call me the Battousai. Ryu-Sou-Sen.
[Amakusa] Time for it to begin. I will have my revenge soon enough!
Amakusa gathers all of his stregenth and casts his time portal under Kenshin's 
feet, however Kenshin is struggling to move.
[Sano] KENSHIN!!!
[Kenshin] Remember the promise I made to you Sano!  REMEMBER THE PROMISE!
Kenshin gets sucked in the time portal and the portal closes after him.
[Sano] You piece of shit! You took my only comrade that I had that I cared for! 
I'm gonna wipe your ass all over the floor!
Sano charges at Amakusa and uses his futae no kiwami. It connects to Amakusa and 
Amakusa is knocked out. Sano is still enraged.
5 minutes later:
[Amakusa] (struggling) Despite the fact that I had sent the Battousai to the 
Abyss, my plan will not go unchanged.  I will die and I will rise again to take 
my revenge on this world!
However that was a different story.  Amakusa's power vanquished, the green glow 
was gone, the windows were opened, and Amakusa was cut in half.
[Amakusa (screaming)] I DON'T WANT TO DIE!!
The body vanquishes and Zankuro Comes out.
[Zankuro] I am the most powerful now.  Thanks to Amakusa I have my own plans 
now.
[Saitoh] So you are Zankuro.  Prepare to be sent back.
Saitoh draws his sword and goes into his Gatotsu stance, However Zankuro had 
already had his sword in hand.
Zankuro charges after Saitoh and swings his sword at lightning speed, and Saitoh 
blocks it, and kicks him in the stomach, forcing Zankuro back. Zankuro uses his 
fist of lightning and hits Saitoh, knocking him back to the ground.  Saitoh gets 
up and prepares his Gatotsu stance again.  He uses the GATOTSU ZERO attack, 
impaling Zankuro.  Zankuro dies.

All of the sudden the castle starts rumbling and crashing in on it self.  Sano 
gets the girl that had been drained of her spirit, and they all make a break for 
it to the outskirts of the castle where Haomaru and Nakoruru are.  The castle 
disappears in a cloud of dust and smoke.
{In the rain}
[Haomaru] Where is Kenshin?
[Sano] Gone.  Amakusa had sent him somewhere of which we even don't know.  Lets 
all go back to Tokyo to get checked out. Only he can get out of this trap now. 
(angry)  Damn it! I hate that bastard! (hits the ground with his fist.)
[Haomaru]  I knew I should have done the job myself.
[Nakoruru] I hope he finds a way back soon. (sad) I had not had a chance to 
thank him personally.



Present day
{Kotowari}
Kenshin is unconscious at this time, and he is dreaming about what had happened 
from from his fight Aamakusa. However he remembered something.  "I will have my 
revenge."  He also remembers everyone from his journey from the Kamiya dojo, and 
realizes that he had to protect the people. "I must return there soon, I had 
made my promise and I intend to keep it."  He awakens from his sleep, and finds 
out that he didn't know where he was nor if it was still the Meiji era.
[Kenshin (to himself)]  Where am I, that is?
Kenshin looks around, but he sees nothing but forest.  He decides that he has to 
be a rurouni to find out again.  He decides to head east in order to find 
something.  Three miles into wandering he finds a clearing.  He remembers it 
now.
[Kenshin]  This tree, it stands out from the rest of them, for is it is three 
times larger.  I wonder why? (referring to Funaho)
Kenshin remembers it from his wandering ten years after the Bakumatsu.  He had 
fallen under asleep under it at one time. He had a dream of a samurai on a 
flying object, and a demon-looking woman with rage.  With an energy sword the 
Samurai fought valiantly against the demon, and the demon was very strong with 
her skill.  The samurai with his sword sucked up the demon's gems that were on 
her arms, and they were implanted on her arms, and were implanted in the sword, 
and the demon was vanquished.  Kenshin decides to go see it again, and sits 
right under it.  He is still weak because of the battle with Amakusa, and he 
falls asleep again.

Meanwhile... At the Masaki Household

[Azaka]  Ohayo, Kamidake
[Kamidake] Ohayo, Azaka.  It's a beautiful day isn't it?
[Azaka] It sure is. It's so peaceful.
[Both] Ahhh.

Sasami was the one to wake up early, to make breakfast for the household.  
Tenchi, Ryo-Ohki, Ryoko, and Aeka were there, and it was morning. What Tenchi 
didn't realize is that Ryoko was floating right on top of him.

[Ryoko] (softly) Ohayo, Tenchi.
Tenchi is trying to wake up, and focus his eyes, soon as his vision becomes 
clear, he is surprised to see Ryoko right over him.
[Tenchi] HOW MANY TIMES DID I TELL YOU NOT TO DO THAT RYOKO!
Tenchi rolls out of the bed.  He gets prepared to leave his room.
[Ryoko] Tenchi?
[Tenchi]  At least will you let me go to the bathroom in peace?

Tenchi opens up his door in his room, and heads for the bathroom.  Aeka was in 
the hallway.
[Aeka] Ohayo, Tenchi-sama.
[Tenchi] Ohayo, Aeka-sama.  How was your morning?
[Aeka]  It was good, thank you for asking.
[Tenchi] talk to you later then.

Tenchi really heads to the bathroom, and finally gets the load off of him; he 
manages to wash up before someone else was to intrude.  Finally he heads to the 
living room.

[Sasami] Ohayo, Tenchi-niichan.  Breakfast is ready.
[Tenchi] Arigato Sasami-chan, I'm really hungry (laughs).  How was your morning?
[Sasami] So-so. (For Sasami had a prophetic premonition of something.  In her 
vision, she saw a group of murderers with katanas come to the forest to kill off 
the Masaki household.)
Tenchi eats the breakfast, and finds it better than yesterdays. She is getting 
better every day if she keeps this up she'd be a master chef.
[Tenchi]  This is really delicious Sasami-chan.  I commend you for this; you are 
getting better every day!
[Sasami] Thank you Tenchi.
The rest of the group comes down to eat their portion.
[Ryo-Ohki] MIYA!
[Sasami] Ohayo, Ryo-Ohki, your special breakfast is ready.
Ryo-Ohki eats the carrots and is happy; she decides to jump on Sasami's shoulder 
to get on her usual spot, Sasami's head.
[Ryo-Ohki] Miya! Miya!
[Aeka] Just what I don't need to see this morning, a devil-woman.
[Ryoko] Shut up, you stuck up wench!
Tenchi reads the local newspaper, and a report catches his eye:
"Homicidal Maniacs at Large" by Amano Miyazaki
Murderers with katanas have killed five people, as they cut their throats.  The 
motive for the homicides is the men that were killed were carrying wooden 
shinais (bamboo swords), as they were trained in the Kamiya Kasshin Style.  The 
motive has probably been justified as revenge.  The suspects have fled to the 
forests of Okayama.
Meanwhile:
Hiruma Tetsuo, the great-grand son of Hiruma Gohei, makes his plan to continue 
the revenge plot to rid of the Kamiya Kasshin Style, started by his great grand 
father.
[Tetsuo] Soon our revenge will be complete.
[Thugs] That is great Hiruma Tetsuo, I mean Master Battousai.
[Tetsuo]  Well then, lets look for the last of them, I know there a few around 
that that skill.
Tetsuo Uses his left hand with his katana and makes a downward stroke against a 
straw dummy; the dummy is disintegrated. 
[thugs] VERY POWERFUL, MASTER BATTOUSAI.
Back at the Masaki House:
[Aeka] At least I don't run off naked in the middle of the house!
[Ryoko] You are just trying to get Tenchi for yourself!
[Tenchi (uncomfortable)] Stop this now.
Both look at Tenchi with fury in their eyes.
[Tenchi] I'm outta here.  Sasami I'll be at the carrot field.
[Sasami] I'll make you a bento lunch for you there.
[Tenchi] Thanks, Sasami-chan. Jya ne.

Tenchi heads to the carrot field to till it, for Ryo-Ohki is a carrot guzzler.
[Tenchi] Man, that cabbit eats so much, it should go on a diet!
Tenchi tills the fields until lunch.  Tenchi hopes there will be enough for the 
year.
[Tenchi] Man I'm tired.
Sasami Comes with the bento lunches, Ryo-Ohki comes with her.
[Sasami] It's lunch time Tenchi-niichan, hey how about we go to eat where Funaho 
is?
[Tenchi] Ok Sasami-chan.
{Mammote Iru (Kenshin theme)}
Both of them head up the Masaki Shrine way and make the shortcut to where Funaho 
is.
[Ryo-Ohki] <Sniff> <Sniff> <Sniff> Miya!
Ryo-Ohki jumps off Sasami and heads to the big tree.
At Funaho:
Kenshin finally wakes up from his exhaustion and realizes where he is.
[Kenshin] I'm starving, that I am.  I wish I had some more of Kaoru-dono's 
cooking, that I would like.
Kenshin sees something black scurry in the bushes; Kenshin gets up and prepares 
himself with his sakabatou.  Ryo-ohki pops out of the bushes, right in Kenshin's 
view.
[Kenshin] (surprised) ORO?  Oh just a cat, but rather a strange one. I've never 
seen one with long ears and a bushy tail; that I have not seen. Hahah.
Kenshin gets down and the cabbit comes closer.
[Kenshin] are you hungry? Let's see what I have.
Kenshin reaches into his gee and gets what he could grab out of it.
[Kenshin] A carrot?  Oh yeah, Kaoru-dono was throwing stuff at Sano and it hit 
me, therefore it must have slipped into my pocket, that it has.
[Ryo-Ohki] (gleaning eyes) MIYAAA!
[Kenshin] Oh? You want it? Here you go.
Kenshin drops the carrot about a few feet away from him.  Ryo-Ohki approaches 
even closer and eats the carrot.  The cabbit is beginning to like this washed 
out samurai, for it had given it what it desired.  The cabbit jumps on Kenshin's 
lap.
[Ryo-ohki] Miya!
Kenshin pets it.
[Kenshin] Kawaii.
Tenchi and Sasami finally make it to Funaho.
[Sasami] There you are, Ryo-ohki!
Ryo-ohki jumps off Kenshin's lap and runs to Sasami. Ryo-Ohki jumps up to 
Sasami's head.  As Sasami looks at where Ryo-Ohki was she sees the man with red 
hair, blue eyes, the katana, and the cross-shaped scar on his left cheek.  
Kenshin looks at the young girl, with blue hair and ponytails, pink eyes, and a 
frecklish complexion, and the man with black hair, brown eyes, and a wooden 
sword.
[Kenshin (confused)] Oro?
[Sasami (smiling)] Hello, Mr. Samurai, I am Sasami Jurai.
[Tenchi] Hello.  My name is Tenchi Masaki.
[Kenshin] I'm a Rurouni; just a Rurouni, for I drift place to place without 
knowing where I go, that I do.
[Tenchi] what's with the katana? Are you running from the police or something?
[Kenshin] Oro? Have a look at my sword for yourself; please do.
Tenchi unsheathes the sword that Kenshin had in his hand, however Tenchi finds 
out that the blade is on the wrong side.
[Tenchi]  What's with this sword? The blade is on the wrong side.
[Kenshin]  It's a sakabatou (reverse-blade).  I cannot hurt a fly with it; that 
I can't.
[Sasami] (chuckling) hehehe.  Are you hungry?  I have a bento box to share if 
you want.
[Tenchi] same here.
Kenshin thinks about if he should accept the offer. Gracefully he does.
[Kenshin] Yes, please, for I am famished; that I am.
Tenchi and Sasami come and sit side by side with Kenshin and they start eating 
their lunch together.
[Sasami] Open wide for me, Rurouni-san.  Tell me how is my cooking.
Kenshin opens his mouth for Sasami and Sasami puts the food in his mouth and 
starts eating it.  He found out that it is better than Kaoru's, but since he has 
feelings for Kaoru, he thinks that it is equal with Kaoru.
[Sasami]  (smiling) How is it?
[Kenshin]  It's great, just as good as Kaoru-dono's.  You cooked this didn't 
you?  One day you will be an Iron Chef if you keep improving, that you will be!  
Ryo-Ohki huh?  It's kawaii for your pet as a name.
[Sasami] (laughing) Thank you, Rurouni-san.
All three ate lunch together, once they were finish, both Sasami and Tenchi 
begin to leave back for the house.  However Tenchi thinks; "Kaoru-dono"; Tenchi 
thinks that this samurai is out of place, maybe out of another period or 
something.  Tenchi decides to take note of that.
[Tenchi] Well, it's been fun having to chat with someone else other than the 
regulars here.  Good luck on your journeys, Ruruouni-san.
[Kenshin] Jya ne.
Both Tenchi and Sasami leave to head back to the house, and out of Kenshin's 
sight.  However someone else finds out that Tenchi had a wooden sword.
{Gohei's theme}
[Tetsuo]  Heheh, another man with a wooden sword, stop right where you are!
Tenchi and Sasami look to where the man is, however they are outnumbered, for 
the man had a group of thugs with katanas.
[Sasami] I'm scared, Tenchi!
Tenchi wields his sword and prepares for battle, to protect Sasami.
[Tenchi] You are the murderers that I read in the newspaper.  They were right 
about fleeing into the forest.
[Tetsuo]  Yes, and I will be the third to be named the Battousai.  Soon my 
revenge will be complete!  Let's see what you got!
[Tenchi] GYYA!
Tenchi charges after Tetsuo with his sword, however Tetsuo blocks his attack 
with his right hand, It gave no injury to him.
[Tetsuo]  I didn't feel a thing! I am the strongest!
Tetsuo makes a swing with his sheathed sword and Tenchi blocks the attack, but 
the bokken was destroyed from the impact.  Tetsuo uses his sheathed sword and 
picks up Tenchi by the chin.  Sasami is very fearful, for this is the man that 
was in her dream that was supposed to kill off the Masaki family.
[Tetsuo] Well gang, this is the last one, to use the Kamiya Kasshin Ryu!  But 
before I kill him, how about if your swords taste blood before I finish him off?
[Thugs] Sure, Master Battousai!
As all were coming close for the kill, Sasami starts to cry.
[Sasami] TENCHI!
[Jubei (thug)] Master.
Tetsuo looks at Jubei.
[Tetsuo] What is it, Jubei?
The look of the thug was as if he had the thousand-yard stare.
[Jubei] H. Hh. He's strong.
{Rurouni's Theme}
Jubei passes out right in front to reveal Kenshin from behind.
[Tetsuo] hmmm.
[Kenshin] Don't even lay a scratch on them!
Kenshin walks up to Tetsuo and looks at him with his manslayer eyes.
[Sasami] The Rurouni.
[Tetsuo] Heh, I guess you agree with the boy about "the sword that protects 
life".
[Kenshin] no.
Kenshin begins to step up.
[Kenshin] A sword is a weapon. (Remembering his past)  Kenjutsu is the art of 
killing. (Remembering) That's its true nature.  That word of 'the sword that 
protects life' is for one who has not stained his hands.
Kenshin smiles.
[Kenshin] However, I like the idealism better than it's true nature.  If one 
asks so much, I want the world to accept it as its true nature.
Tetsuo drops Tenchi and starts grinning.
[Tetsuo] Get Him!  I don't care if you kill him!
[Tenchi] Run!
Kenshin prepares for his battle stance.
[Kenshin] Stop! I don't want to hurt anyone.
Kenshin uses his thumb to unsheathe his sword.
[Thugs] There will only be, Just ONE DEATH!
Kenshin grabs his sword swings it upward at lightning fast speed. He knocks out 
two thugs with one swing.  He makes another swing and knocks five more.  Tenchi 
and Sasami have their eyes open wide in astonishment.  He makes a lightning 
quick advance and gets more.  One of the thugs that got knocked back is scared 
to hell.
[Thug (very fearful)] He's knocked out five people in once swing! It's like 
magic!
Tenchi thinks to himself  "No, he's anticipating their movements.  He knows 
where they will go." Kenshin makes the final swing upward and knocks out the 
rest of the thugs.
[Tetsuo] Red hair. The scar on his cheek.  That man is....
[Kenshin] I forgot something.  The Hitokiri Battousai's style is neither of the 
Kamiya Kasshin Style or of yours.  It's from Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu, and without 
this blade... I could have easily wasted everyone here.
[Tenchi&Sasami] You mean, you are the real legendary Hitokiri?
[Tetsuo] Interesting.  The world doesn't need two Battousais.  The name is more 
befitting of me.  And it will be mine after I defeat you.
[Kenshin] I don't care.
[Tetsuo] Die, Battousai!
Tetsuo makes his sword swing down, however Kenshin jumps up.
[Kenshin] Up here!
Kenshin makes his downward stroke, however Tetsuo doesn't realize that he had 
dodged his attack.  Kenshin's sakabatou hits Tetsuo on the left sword wielding 
hand, causing his bones in his hands to break. The result of the impact creates 
a dust cloud.
[Tetsuo] (screaming in pain) Gyaaaaaaaaaaa!
Kenshin sheathes his sword and looks at the thug sitting.
[Kenshin] I am not fond of the name of Battousai, but I cannot give it to a man 
like you, that I cant.  However you will not be able to wield a sword with those 
fingers anymore.  
[thug] I can't believe it, no one is dead; they are only unconscious.
[Kenshin] You, Go tell the police of what this man has been doing.
The thug flees the scene screaming his head off. Kenshin looks at Tenchi and 
Sasami with a smile.
[Kenshin]  Gomen Nasai, Tenchi and Sasami.  I didn't mean to deceive you both.  
But... its something that I didn't really want to talk about.
Sasami looks at Kenshin with glassy eyes.
[Kenshin] Well, take care.
Kenshin begins to wander off, however Sasami stops him.
[Sasami] BAKA!
[Kenshin] ORO?
[Sasami] Are you just going to leave?  How am I supposed to take care of Tenchi?  
Why can't you stay and help us a little?  I don't care about your past!
[Kenshin] But you can clear the disgrace from this.  If the real Battousai stays 
here, it will be for naught.
{Kaoru's Love}
[Sasami] I didn't say that I wanted the Battousai to stay here!  I said that I 
wanted the Rurouni to...
Sasami covers her mouth in order to not complete that statement. Sasami finds 
out that she is starting to have affection for him.
[Sasami]  Why do you have to leave?  At least tell me your name, not the 
legendary one, but your real one.
[Kenshin] Himura.  Himura Kenshin.
[Sasami] Kenshin.  If you want to leave...
The sound of footsteps from Kenshin are fading but they stop.
Sasami sighs.
[Kenshin]  I am a little tired from my journey.
Sasami turns round and looks at Kenshin.  He is wearing a smile.
[Kenshin]  A drifter never knows where he is going, or for how long.
Kenshin walks to Sasami.
[Kenshin] I'm not a very good cook.  I might accidentally walk on you in the 
bath.
Sasami makes a fist.
[Sasami] No problem.  If that happens...
Sasami makes the punch at Kenshin, however he doesn't move.  Instead it 
connects, causing Kenshin to fall backward.
[Kenshin(in pain)] Oroooooo!
[Sasami] Baka! I thought that you would dodge it!
Tenchi laughs.
[Kenshin (stunned)] W.. What amazing power you have!
Back at the Tenchi Household:
Tenchi is fixing up Kenshin's injury
[Kenshin] Oh, but it hurts!
[Ryoko and Ayeka] You chicken! Chicken!
Sasami narrates.  "So now we have someone new staying with us at the Masaki 
House."


Author's note:
This is my first Fanfic involving Tenchi Muyo, since I like the kenjutsu martial 
arts and katanas and that some sort, I decided that I wanted to contribute to 
the many fanfics that were there for everyone to read.  This may even be the 
first main Crossover for the Rurouni Kenshin universe, so I did my best with my 
writer's inspiration and created this little beauty.  I'm still thinking on what 
to write about, but I wish to surprise people with both comedy and drama with a 
few surprises in between.  I wish to keep my ideas in secret therefore I do not 
wish to be bothered on this.  The {X themes} are actual CD tracks from the 
Rurouni Kenshin TV and OAV series, as those aided me in creating the 
inspiration.
