          I don't own Gundam Wing or Tenchi Muyo, I'm
          just borrowing them for
          the moment.  This is my first crossover fan fic between
          the two.
          Enjoy!!!!!!

          Prolouge

          Note: This takes place a month after the encounter with
          Haruna.

                 Ayeka sat on her bed, brushing her long purple
          hair, looking
          at the portal Washu had built.  She could use it
          whenever she
          wanted.  Ever since she returned to Jurai, she missed
          Earth, but this
          was her home, not only that, but she was the first Crown
          Princess of
          Jurai, and it was her duty.  She had spent enough time
          on Earth and
          she decided it was time for her to return.

                 She looked at the photograph of her and Tenchi.
           Somehow, she
          knew she could never be with him, even if they were
          related by Royal
          blood, his life was on Earth, and he would never ascend
          the throne.
          IF they were meant to be together, they would have been
          by now.  But
          they weren't.  Ayeka was not about to waste
          anymore time on him.  It
          hurt too much.  And the whole thing with Haruna made
          things worse.
          About a month after her returned from her dream world,
          she left.

                Ayeka put her brush down and laid down, pulling
          the covers
          over her.  She stared at the ceiling, remembering the
          night she left
          Earth for good.

          A month earlier...........

          "Ayeka you can't be serious."  Tenchi stammered,
          shock written all
          over his face.
          "I'm afraid I am Lord Tenchi."  She nodded,
          turning away from him.
          "But why........"  His voice trailed off.
          Ayeka looked at the floor, clasping her hands infront of

          her.  "Because it hurts to much to stay here any longer.
           My home is
          Planet Jurai, and I choose to return."
          Tenchi arched his eyebrows.  "What do you mean it hurts
          to stay here?"
          Tears shimmered to life in Ayeka's eyes as she
          turned at looked at
          him.  "It hurts because you and Yosho were taken away by
          that
          woman......Haruna.  And I refuse to fight with Ryoko
          anymore.  All
          this has brought me nothing but pain.  Sometimes I think
          it would
          have been better if I never came here in the first
          place."  With
          that, she turned and ran, not waiting for Tenchi to
          answer.

               Ayeka hugged her younger sister Sasami with tears
          in her eyes,
          she nodded at Mihoshi and Washu, who in turn nodded
          back.  She looked
          up at Ryoko, who stood right infront of her.  Slowly she
          let go of
          her sister.
          "I'm going to miss you Princess."  She smiled
          faintly.
          "I'll miss you to.  Take care of Tenchi alright."
           Ayeka whispered.
          Ryoko nodded, hesitant at first, then hugged her.
          Ayeka's tears fell freely as she embraced the
          Space Pirate.  "I hope
          we meet again someday Ryoko.  Until then.  Bye."  She
          said, letting
          go, and turned away, walking towards the space ship.
          "Goodbye Ayeka.  Take care."  Ryoko nodded once, tears
          welling up in
          her eyes also,  as she watched Ayeka approach Ryo-oul.
          Yosho and Nubiyuki watched her, she turned around and
          gave them a
          slight wave.  They waved back.

                Tenchi ran as fast as he could, he had to see
          Ayeka one last
          time.  He wouldn't let her leave without him
          saying his good-byes.
          He made it just in time to see her making her way to her
          ship.
          "Ayeka wait!"  He shouted.
          She turned around, a slight smile on her face.  "Lord
          Tenchi........."  She said as he caught up to her, and
          stood there,
          catching his breath.
          "I had to say goodbye."  He smiled slightly.
          She looked at the ground, closing her eyes.  "I guess
          this is goodbye
          then."
          Tenchi nodded.  "Yeah.  I guess it is.  Will you ever
          come back?"
          Ayeka sighed.  "Perhaps."
          "Take care."  Tenchi said, taking her hand in his and
          gently
          squeezing it.
          "You too.  Farewell Tenchi."  She said, taking her hand
          back, and
          made her way to her ship.  Not looking back.
          Tenchi watched her ship take off.  A his expression sad.
           "Lady
          Ayeka........"

               Wufei pushed the trigger button, and watched as the
          base
          exploded.  He turned and ran as fast as he could.  His
          gundam was
          hidden in the jungle and he was supposed to meet up with
          Duo at their
          base.

               Shenlong was in the air in no time.  He flew it in
          the
          direction of the ocean where Duo's spice was.  No
          other mobile suits
          followed him, so he had no battles to deal with for the
          moment.
          "That was to easy."  He said, smirking.  "Oz must be
          getting rusty."

                Ayeka wiped her face with a towel as she made her
          way back to
          her room.  She had just finished her eighth lesson in
          Jurian Martial
          Arts.  She had been learning the ways for the past month
          since she
          returned.  Not only that, but she also learned how to
          control her
          power a little mote.
               If she was to be Jurai's Queen one day, then
          she wanted to be
          strong enough to lead that role.  And she would accept
          the man her
          father choose as her husband.  Like it or not.

               She entered her room, setting down her bo staff and
          threw her
          towel onto the floor.  She looked at the portal,
          wondering if she
          should use it to call Sasami, deciding to do it after
          she freshened
          up.  So she took of her purple pants and  tile shirt,
          which she wore
          for her training, putting on a lavender robe, and
          letting down her
          long purple hair from the ponytail which it had been
          tied in earlier,
          then went into her private bathroom to prepare her bath.

          "Go easy on me Wufei.  It's only my first lesson
          you know........"
          Duo arched his eyebrow, slowly getting up from the
          floor, where his
          Chinese friend had tossed him a moment ago.
          Wufei watched him, and shook his head, crossing his
          arms.  "First
          lesson or not, you must never take your eyes of
          opponent.  That's why
          it was so easy for me to throw you across the room."
          Duo frowned at him, knowing he was right, and faced him,
          rubbing the
          side of his head.
          Wufei's lips curved into a faint smile.  "Try
          again.  This time don't
          over estimate your opponent."
          "I'll show you over estimating."  Duo smirked,
          charging at him.
          Wufei chucked, and caught Duo's arms in a strong
          grip and flinged him
          once again to the floor.
          "Ow........"  Duo moaned, laying on his back.
          Wufei kneeled down beside him and arched his eyebrow.
           "Second
          lesson.  Never attack with emotions.  To do so shows
          nothing but
          weakness."
          Duo stared up at him, confusion written all over his
          face.  Wufei
          then stood up, and turned around, walking towards the
          other side of
          the room where the door was.
          "That's it for tonight."  He said before leaving
          the room.

                Ayeka dried herself off and changed into a peach
          colored
          kimono, designed with silver images here and there, and
          fastened it
          with a light blue sash.  Slowly she approached the
          mirror like object
          and studied the computer keyboard.
          "Now how exactly does this work?"  She said to herself,
          looking at
          the keys.  Wondering which key was the communicator one.
          "If only Washu had explained how to use this thing in
          much easier
          terms."  She frowned before touching a blue button and
          awaited to see
          what would happen.

               The machine turned on, with a loud sound and blue
          light filled
          the room, along with a force of energy pushing her back.
          She gasped as the light brightened.

               Wufei stood at the side of the ship, leaning
          against the
          railing, watching the waves dance.
          "Nice night wouldn't you say?"  Said a cheerful
          voice.
          He turned around to see Duo leaning against a wall with
          his arms
          folded, looking up at the stars.
          "It's peaceful."  He said, turning his gaze back
          to the water.
          Duo shook his head and stood beside him, leaning his
          back against the
          railing, putting his hands behind his head.
           "Don't you ever get
          tired of being so serious all the time?  You should try
          relaxing and
          enjoy your surroundings once."
          Wufei didn't say anything, looking up at the night
          sky.
          Duo looked at him, and sighed.  He was about to say
          something else,
          when all of a sudden there was a blur light, and both of
          them stared
          at it, as it grew brighter.
          "What is that?"  Duo asked.
          "I don't know."  Wufei answered.
          Then they felt them selves fading, until they vanished
          from the ship.

                Ayeka covered her eyes as the light grew brighter,
          and looked
          again once the light faded.  Her eyes widened when she
          saw that two
          guys were laying on the floor, unconscious.
