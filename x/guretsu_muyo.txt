Guretsu Muyo: A Jackass / Tenchi Muyo! Fusion

By The Old-Took



This fusion makes the most sense if you have seen MTV's "Jackass."
If you haven't, it airs Sundays at 9pm.  It involves really stupid
(yet surprisingly hilarious) stunts and pranks with guys making, well,
jackasses of themselves.

What this fic will attempt to accomplish is to place the OAV series
crew in their own version of Jackass, called Guretsu Muyo (useless
stupidity), with their own variety of stunts.  Some liberities may be
taken with the characters, but try not to take the whole thing too
seriously.  It's just meant for a quick laugh.

Disclaimer:
I do not own these characters; they are the property of AIC and Pioneer
LDC.  Jackass is owned by MTV (hence by Viacom) and is produced and
created by Johnny Knoxville, Spike Jonze, and Jeff Tremaine.  Please don't
sue me.  I have no money.


And on with the show.

** Masu Wrestling **

Int. Washu's Lab

	A red crab bell jangles as the lab door opens.  TENCHI steps into
	the lab and closes the door.

	Looking into the camera:

					Tenchi
		Hi, I'm Tenchi Masaki.  Welcome to Guretsu Muyo.

	Tenchi wanders further into the lab, when he hears WASHU's voice.

	VO:

					Washu
		So, Tenchi, you here to donate a sample?

					Tenchi
		Not exactly.  Say, I see you've collected more Masu.

	Tenchi reaches a large tank tilled with water and small blobs
	floating about inside.  Standing in front is Washu.

					Washu
		That's right Tenchi.

					Tenchi
		Since I was out in the field when you were explaining the
		Masu to the others, I was wondering if you would mind going
		over some of the basic points with me.

					Washu
		Sure thing Tenchi.  The Masu are a collective of single celled
		protoplasmic lifeforms.  They respond to a leader Masu, or
		another lifeform that has a strong will.  When grouped
		together, they are extremely powerful if they sense that they
		are under attack.

					Tenchi
		So what are my chances of wrestling the Masu, Washu-chan?

					Washu
		Slim to none, Tenchi, slim to none.


Int. Kitchen - Day

	SASAMI is on her step stool in front of the counter chopping
	vegetables.  Several large pots are on the stove, one on the
	verge of boiling over.

	Tenchi enters the kitchen:

					Tenchi
		Sasami, you've seen what the Masu can do, right?

	Sasami is still focused on chopping the vegetables:

					Sasami
		Yeah, why?

					Tenchi
		What are my chances of wrestling the Masu?

	Sasami is obviously disturbed by this idea, and looks over at Tenchi:

					Sasami
		Not good Tenchi, I wish you wouldn't do it.  (to herself) Now
		where did I put the "Mr. Sparkle" dishsoap?


Int. Living Room - Day

	RYOKO is laying on the couch, watching a soap opera featuring two
	badly drawn colored blobs with flippers.

	Tenchi sits down on the couch beside her:

					Tenchi
		Ryoko, what are my chances of wrestling the Masu?

	Ryoko bolts upright and stares Tenchi in the eyes:

					Ryoko
		Why on earth would you want to do that?  Have you gone nuts?

					Tenchi
		I'm fine, it'll be alright.  C'mon, what are my chances?

					Ryoko
		Slim to none.


Int. Washu's Lab

	A wrestling ring is set up in the middle of the lab.  Tenchi is
	standing in one corner, wearing a wrestling uniform.  Washu is
	standing by the Masu tank.  She is wearing a metal cap with several
	wires coming out of it and going to a computer.

	Inside the ring, acting as the announcer, is MIHOSHI, wearing a
	tuxedo.

	Standing outside the ring are AYEKA, Sasami, Ryoko, and RYO-OHKI.

					Tenchi
		Washu-chan, are the Masu ready?

					Washu
		Almost there!

	Washu opens a valve, flushing the Masu from the tank through a pipe
	onto the ring.  She stands over the oozing pile of goo with a look
	of concentration on her face.

					Washu
		Just have to concentrate to get them going.  This device
		should be amplifying my brainwaves and directing them to
		the Masu.

	The Masu pile quivers, then gathers itself together and takes on a
	humanoid form, much like the one that Ryo-ohki assimilated.

	Cut to Tenchi:

					Tenchi
		Hi, I'm Tenchi Masaki and this is "Masu Wrestling."

	Cut to Mihoshi:

					Mihoshi
		Ladies and gentlemen!  Tonight, for one night only, we present
		to you Tenchi Masaki versus the Masu!  Okay you two, keep it
		clean and let's get it on!

	Washu rings a bell.

	Cut to the ring:

	Tenchi and the Masu square off and size each other up.  Tenchi backs
	off.

					Tenchi
		Yeah, what's up Masu, ya wanna take on the Light Hawk Master,
		huh?  C'mon punk, let's see whatcha got for me!

	Tenchi and the Masu lock up.  The Masu proceeds to pick Tenchi up
	and holds him in the air.  A loud WHAM echos throughout the lab as
	Tenchi is slammed to the mat.   He slowly crawls to the ropes and
	pulls himself up.  The Masu stands on the opposite side of the ring,
	points its arm towards Tenchi, and zaps him with an energy bolt.

	Tenchi, writhing on the mat:

					Tenchi
		Aww shiiit that hurts!  Dammit!  C'mon, fight fair.  Don't get
		me pissed or I'll have to...yeeoww!

	The Masu zaps him again as he tries to get up, then one more time.
	Tenchi collapses in a smoking heap, and groans:

					Tenchi
		Slim to none my ass.  More like a snowball's chance in hell...

	Cut to Mihoshi, standing by the Masu in the middle of the ring:

					Mihoshi
		By decision, the winner is...Ryoko's honorable father, uh,
		the Masu!  Hey, what are you doing?  Lookout, it's loose!
		Help, Washu-chan, do something!  Run for your life!

	Everyone is running about the lab in a scene of chaos as the Masu
	goes on a rampage.

	Cut to static.



** Home Security **

Ext. Front Gate - Day

	Tenchi is standing in front of the gate with Ayeka and her two
	guardians, AZAKA and KAMIDAKE, at their usual position of gate
	posts.

					Tenchi
		Hi, I'm Tenchi Masaki, and today we'll be conducting a little
		demonstration of our home security.  I'll be testing out the
		two guardians, the princess's micro logs, and something that
		Ryoko has prepared as a surprise.

	Ayeka looks down and slowly shakes her head.

					Tenchi
		Now, I'm going to try to run through the gate, and you two
		have stop me.  When I start, don't listen to me, only take
		orders from the princess, got it?

					Azaka & Kamidake
		Yes sir!  We will do our best!

					Ayeka
		Do you think this is a good idea, Lord Tenchi?

					Tenchi
		Everything is under control.  CHARGE!!

	Tenchi tries to run through the gate, and is stopped by a forcefield.
	The guardians then shock him with bolts of energy that crackle from
	their surfaces.

					Tenchi
		Yeeooww!  Dammit, knock it off!

	He struggles to free himself, and is shocked again.  Ayeka stands to
	the side, too stunned to do anything.

					Tenchi
		Ayeka, do something!  Kuso!  Yeeooww!!

	Tenchi is shocked several more times by the guardians, at which point
	Ayeka remembers she has to call them off.

					Ayeka
		Azaka!  Kamidake!  Cease immediately!

					Azaka & Kamidake
		Yes Princess!

	The forcefield is shut off, and Tenchi proceeds to stumble about
	while cursing to himself.

Ext. Front Yard - Day

					Tenchi
		Ok, Ayeka, now we're going to test your force field emitters.
		Don't worry, I'll be fine, I think.

	With a sigh:
					Ayeka
		If you say so, Lord Tenchi. (under her breath) Stupid show.

					Tenchi
		All right, HIT ME!

	Tenchi is immediately surrounded by an array of miniature logs.
	They emit a barely visible translucent force field that squeezes
	Tenchi in a body bind.  This bind tightens as Tenchi squirms to free
	himself.

					Tenchi
		Aw crap, I can't breathe!  Lemme outta this thing!

	Tenchi is promptly released, drops to his knees, and begins coughing
	as he sucks in a lungful of fresh air.

	VO:
					Mihoshi
		Could you tell us which one was worse, Tenchi?

					Tenchi
		Definitely the guardians.  They shocked the bejesus out of me.
		Trust me, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone.  But this one
		was pretty bad, too.  I think I'm gonna be sore for a couple
		of days.

	VO:
					Ryoko
		Tenchi, are you ready for my big surprise?

	Pan from Tenchi to Ryoko, who is hanging out of the second floor
	window, waving to Tenchi.  She phases back inside.

Int. Upper Room

	Ryoko is hovering over an elaborate setup of PA gear, turning
	various knobs and pushing buttons.

	To herself:
					Ryoko
		Okkaaay, boost the treble and mids *way* up, amplifier set to
		maximum, that should do it, heh heh heh.

Ext. Front Yard

					Tenchi
		Allright, Ryoko, we're set!  Ayeka, you know what she's up to?

					Ayeka
		No, I don't Tenchi, but I know she's up to no good.

Int. Upper Room

	Most of Ryoko's face is hidden in a shadow, except for a crooked
	grin. Camera follows her hand as she moves it across a mixing board
	to a tape deck, then pushes play.

Ext. Front Yard

	A short burst of static erupts from a set of loudspeakers hung from
	above the porch.

	Playing Ryoko's voice:
					Speakers
		Introducing Ryoko's Ultimate Home Security System!

	Following this announcement, a high pitched squeal bursts from the
	speakers.  The squeal is actually a rather familiar, though
	distorted, voice in a fast paced tirade saying something about an
	ugly demon and drinking sake.

	Ryoko appears next to Tenchi and hangs off his shoulders.

					Ryoko
		I made a recording of Ayeka during one of our fights.
		Personally, I think this would scare off anyone.  Ya
		like it?

	Tenchi faints.  Ayeka grabs Ryoko's throat and squeezes it until
	Ryoko's face turns blue, all while her amplified voice screeches
	from the speakers.

	Fade out.


** Random Scene 1 **

Ext. Masaki House - Night

	A lone figure is running on top of the roof towards the edge.
	Several other figures are hanging around the shrubbery below,
	quietly laughing with each other.

	The figure reaches the edge, takes a small leap, and plummets
	screaming into the shrubbery below.

	Mihoshi slowly crawls out while everyone is laughing.


** Skating in Tokyo **

Ext. Downtown Tokyo - Day

	The sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians.  Careening down the
	sidewalk while weaving around the pedestrians is Ryoko on a
	skateboard.  She is attired in baggy cargo shorts, boarding shoes,
	a loose shirt, and shades.

	While crossing a street, she misses the olly up the curb and flies
	off the board, much to the shock of the people around her.  Ryoko
	screams as she heads towards a wall.  To everyone's greater suprise,
	she phases halfway though the wall, leaving only her legs dangling
	out of a seemingly solid wall.

	Quietly to herself:
					Ryoko
		Heh heh, bunch of suckers.

	A crowd gathers around her, with everyone talking excitedly about
	what to do.

	Muffled:
					Ryoko
		Oh, won't someone please help? Help! Get me out of here!

	One person begins tugging on a leg, to no availe.  A second person
	pulls on the other at the same time, till they are working in unison.

	Ryoko gives a half-hearted scream.

	Others join in the pulling effort, but nothing works.

	At last, several people pull at once, while Ryoko phases out of the
	wall and allows herself to be pulled out.  However, with everyone
	pulling, she comes flying out of the wall backwards and knocks
	several people over.

	Ryoko teleports back to the shrine.  And like that, she was gone.

	Everone at the wall (which has no hole in it) stands around blinking
	their eyes and looking confused.

	Fade out.


** Fun with Mountain Bikes **

Ext. Masaki Shrine - Day

	Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ayeka are seated on mountain bikes at the top
	of the steps going up the hill to the shrine.

	Yosho stands in the shrine's doorway.  Noboyuki stands in the brush
	to the sides of the steps near the top.  Ryoko and Tenchi are
	halfway down the stairs and at the bottom, respectively.  All three
	are armed with cameras.

	Cut to Ayeka:
					Ayeka
		I'm Ayeka Jurai, and this is mountain bike fun.

	Washu stands behind the girls at the top.  She raises her hand into
	the air, grabs a starter pistol out of subspace, and fires.

					Washu
		Begin!

	Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ayeka pedal to the steps and proceed to ride
	straight down.  All three begin to scream.

	As they pick up speed, Mihoshi loses her balance not far from the
	top, wobbles about violently, wipes out and does a superman into
	the brush.

					Mihoshi
		Waaaahh!

	Sasami and Ayeka pick up some real speed while bouncing down the
	steps and scream even louder.

	Cut to Ryoko's POV, halfway down:

	Ayeka is in the lead, her teeth clenched together, and eyes large
	as saucers.	 She's also white as a ghost.  Ryoko chucks a stick at
	her, but misses.

	Sasami is doing the best she can to hang on for dear life.  As she
	passes Ryoko, she bails off into the brush.  The bike ghost rides
	for a few meters, then clatters to rest on the steps.

	Cut to Tenchi's POV:

	Ayeka is approaching at breakneck speed down the steps.  Tears are
	streaming from her eyes and are whipped behind her as the wind
	pushes them back.

	She passes by in a flash and a scream, reaching the bottom unscathed.
	She brakes hard, skids around, stops, and...

	Thud.  Ayeka keels over in a dead faint.

	At that moment, everyone shouts and exclaims that that was the
	coolest thing they had ever seen.

	Cut to Mihoshi:

	Mihoshi had climbed up a tree close to where she crashed to get
	a better view.  She slips, and tumbles down into the brush.

	Fade out.


** Blowin' Shit up **

Int. Washu's Lab

	Tenchi and Washu stand beside a table in the lab.  This table is
	covered with what appears to be a large quantity of firecrackers.
	Some of them have blinking lights and wires sticking out.

	Washu scoops several of them into a bag.  She and Tenchi leave the
	lab.

	A modified firecracker falls from the table and detonates, leaving
	a large smoking crater in the floor.

Ext. Front Yard - Day

	Tenchi and Washu-chan gather in the front yard with the rest of the
	girls, minus Ryoko.

					Washu
		Hi, I'm Little Washu, and today we're blowin' shit up.

	Washu pulls a red stuffed crab from subspace and sets it on the
	ground in the front yard.  She places one of the blinking
	firecrackers under it.

					Washu
		Okay now, step back.

	She produces a small remote with a large red button and a long thin
	antenna.

					Washu
		Counting down:  3 - 2 - 1 - Hai!

	Washu presses the button and a blinding flash with a thunderous roar
	fill the air.

	When the smoke clears, everyone is standing about looking dazed and
	singed at the edges.  A gaping smoking crater fills half the front
	yard.

					Tenchi
		Incoming!

	The stuffed crab falls from the sky and into Washu's outstretched
	hand.

					Sasami
		Are all those things as powerful as that one?

					Washu
		Of course not.  Most are much bigger! HA HA!

	Washu reaches into the bag, takes out a rather large device, and
	throws it into the lake.  She presses the button.

					Tenchi
		Run!

	Everyone bolts in different directions as the Misaki house is
	inundated by a tidal wave.

	Ryoko suddenly appears by Washu's side.

					Ryoko
		Hey!  What do you think you're doing? You woke me up!  Give
		me those things, or someone's gonna get hurt!

					Washu
		What, you mean little old me?

	Both pull on the bag, but Ryoko prevails and runs off into the woods
	alone to dispose of the bag and its contents so she can return to
	her nap.

	No one notices the remote lying on the ground until Mihoshi steps on
	it.  Several large explosions go off in the woods.  A loud scream
	is heard above the explosions.

					Tenchi
		Incoming!

	A faint scream is heard, then grows louder as a charred and smoking
	Ryoko plummets towards the Misaki home.  She crashes through the
	roof, then storms out of the house, and destroys all the recording
	equipment...

	Cut to static.

** Fin **

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like I said in the beginning, try not to take this thing too seriously.

If you want to do a spinoff or another episode with your own stunts and
pranks, go right ahead, be my guest.

In the works:  Ryoko is sent to the Mirai Trunks' timeline to assist him.
Tenchi's mind is switched with that of Beavis and/or Butthead.
