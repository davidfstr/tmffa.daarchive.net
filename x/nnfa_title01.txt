miracle you actually LIKE it you can send compliments too.

And now, let the chaos begin...


It is a hot summer day and Tenchi is outside working. Suddenly a small
purple dog (courage the cowardly dog) leaps on him.

Tenchi- What the?!...

Courage- Aroo! roof roof! hooowl!!

Tenchi- Bad dog! Down!!

Courage runs off, leaving dust and a very confused Tenchi in his wake.

Tenchi- What was that odd dog so afraid about?

Tenchi suddenly remembers that he still has work to do, and sets off.

Johny Bravo is on a vacation to Japan. Well actually, he meant to head
to Hawaii and hit the waves but due to his soaring hormone levels,
he got thrown into a plane headed to Japan by an annoyed flight
attendant.

Johnny Bravo- This doesn't look like Honolulu. Hey there, pretty baby,
could tell me how to get to-

Local woman- You foul pig beast! How dare you oggle at my anatomy
like the famine- starved vulture eyes the cattle yard!!! You shall eat
many interesting layers of our beloved Japanese soil as I apply my foot
to the approximate location of your anal sphincter!!

Johnny Bravo- Uhhh...

The local woman leaps over Johnny and kicks him in his ass, sending him
soaring.

Johnny Bravo- Whoa momma!!

			_-Never spit into the wind-_

***********************************************************************


As Tenchi heads home, he stops to admire the sunset. He is surprised to
see Ayeka also admiring the sunset.

Ayeka- It is a beautiful sunset, is it not?

Tenchi- Uh, yeah. very... nice?

Ayeka- Tenchi, you sound a bit ill. Are you alright?

Tenchi- Nononoo I'm fine you just startled me a bit.

Ayeka- (Giggles a bit) Sorry. Did you see anything interesting today?

Tenchi- Actually, a purple dog leaped on me. It looked a bit concerned
about something.

Ayeka- Oh? Thats interesting. We better head home while the foods still
warm

Tenchi- Do you hear something?

Ayeka- Like a long scream?

Tenchi- Yeah thats it. Huh?

Tenchi looks up to see a large mass headed toward them.

Tenchi- Yikes! Look out!

Johnny Bravo- Whooaaaaa oooff!

Johnny hits the ground, scattering Tenchi and Ayeka. He soon leaps up,
though and whips out a small mirror.

Johnny Bravo- Ahh man my hair!!

Ayeka- Are you all right?

Johnny Bravo- Yeah just-

Ayeka- I wasn't talking to you!

Tenchi- Yeah I'm fine

			_-Insert odd quote here-_

***********************************************************************


Outside of Tenchi's house, two guys with a MASSIVE hangover stumble
around comtemplating why life is so cruel right now

Dude- ...And I've got like a big headache and

Other Dude- Yeah and I feel like, like throwing up

Dude- Just don't hit me, okay?

Other dude- Yeah sure

The other dude sticks his head into some bushes and lets it loose.

Dude- That was like nasty

Other dude- Dude, where's my car?

Dude- Whaddaya mean? you parked it just behind this big um... oak... tree
that seems to have been replaced by a... umm... reeaaally like pissed
off like long green haired chic.

Ryoko- You threw up on my bush! Grrr...

Other dude- So like what do we do now?

Dude- Like RUN!!!!!!

		_-If you must drink and drive, drink Coke!!-_

***********************************************************************


Ayeka, Washu and Tenchi are in Washu's lab, trying to work out what odd
humanoid creature just landed.

Washu: So you say it just flew out of nowhere and hit you?

Tenchi: Yeah but I couldn't really tell because of the sun.

Ayeka: It was very odd...

Washu: ...It certainly is human like...

Ayeka: interesting umm... hair?

Washu: Quiet I think its waking up!

Johnny Bravo: Uhhh... ohh momma... where am I?

Washu: You are in my laboratory. About half an hour ago you crashed into
a field outside.

Johnny Bravo: What country is the Lab in?

All (minus Johnny Bravo): Japan!!

Johnny Bravo: WHOOOAAAA MOMMMAAA!!!

			_-Nothing is as it seems-_

***********************************************************************



The Dude and the Other Dude are running away from Ryoko rather awkardly
as they still have a massive hangover. Every couple of yards they stop
to vomit or try to talk Ryoko into stop killing them.

Dude: pant... pant...Look, green haired gi-

Ryoko: My name is RYOKO!!

Other dude: Like is there (pant pant) any need to kill us?

Ryoko: Weeeellll... You just vomited on about every square inch of my garden
and just ran through Tenchi's birthday cake... I think I have every
right to kill you!

Dude: (throws up) Dude, like who is Tenchi?

Ryoko: SHUT UP AND EAT DIRT, (censored) HEAD!!!!

Other dude: Hey Dude, a house! Lets like loose her in there!

Dude: Like SWEET!!

Ryoko: Ooohh they ran in the house. This'll be FUN!

			_-Violence isn't the answer-_

***********************************************************************



Johnny Bravo: But I thought I was goin' to Hawaii to hit the surf and
stuff like that...

Washu: Weeelll obviosly jumping out of the plane isn't very accurate.
You should have stayed on.

Johnny Bravo: I did! It landed at an airport and I asked someone for
directions and they kicked me!! Momma this isn't my day...

Washu: Ahh...

Ayeka: Hey look at that dog! How did it get in here?

Tenchi: It's the dog from earlier today!

Courage, who has obviosly seen Ryoko chasing the Dude and the Other Dude,
is trying to imitate the scene, and is having much difficulty.

Ayeka: What is it doing?

Washu: I think its trying to tell us something...

Johnny Bravo: Oh momma! I love shirades!

Ayeka: Umm... wounded people?

Courage: Roof roof. Awoo!!

Tenchi: ...Stoned? Drunk?...

Johnny Bravo: Oh! Disco freaks in a desert!

Courage: Grrr...

Washu: Oh I got it! Two guys with a hangover!

Courage wags its head approvingly and starts to act out Ryoko.

Ayeka: Umm... Tree? Grass?

Tenchi: Hill! Two guys with hangovers lying on a hill!

Ayeka: One of those tropical green parrots!

Washu: (Looking very proud) SHRUBBERY!!!!

Courage looks sad for a bit and continues.

Tenchi: Salad! Salad!

Johnny Bravo: THE BLOB! THE BLOB!!

Courage: GRrrrr...

Johnny Bravo: SNOT! Whoa momma a big load a snot!

Courage: GRRRRRR!!!

Ayeka: That (censored) Ryoko!

Courage seems much more relaxed and starts to act again when Washu
interrupts

Washu: Ryoko is chasing two guys with hangovers trying to kill them and
they're in the-

Washu is cut short as two incredibly sickly looking guys trip and fall
down the staircase and Ryoko is following behind closly with an evil
look in her eyes.

Ryoko: Ha ha haaa! I've got you now!

Dude: (Vomits) Like don't hurt me!

Other dude: (also vomits) We didn't mean to like ruin your shit, man.

Dude: Yeah man.

Ryoko: You... destroyed... Tenchi's... BIRTHDAY CAKE!!!!

Ayeka: (To Johnny) Probably had some poison or something.

Tenchi: Its not my birthday for a couple of months...

Johnny Bravo: (To Ayeka) Yeah well two dudes are two dudes. I better go
help them!

Johnny Bravo leaps between Ryoko and the two dudes and in midair changes
into kung- fu gear (obviously a mistake)

Johnny Bravo: Ho ha! Well I'm gonna have to ask you to step down, lady
or i'll go kung- fu on you! Hiyaaah!!!

Ryoko merely raises an eyebrow.

Johnny Bravo: I thought I told you to stand down, miss. Now prepare for
a kung- fu beating! Wiyaaaah!

Johnny leaps at Ryoko aiming a jump kick right towards her head. Just
before impact, Ryoko teleports behind him and trips him. Johnny leaps
up and launches a barrage of punches and karate chops but misses.
Ryoko lifts him up looks at him hard and then chucks him at a table of
lab equipment, enraging Washu.

Johnny Bravo: WHOOOAAA MOMMMA!!! Ahh man my hair!

Washu: RYOKO!! You destroyed my 
vertigoinducinghydrolatedtrigonomicmalustateremulsifier!!!

All (minus Washu and Ryoko):Whaa?!...

Ryoko: Woops. He he... heee? ohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshitohshit...

Washu storms over to Ryoko and starts to give her a piece of her mind
about her ...ummm... thing.

Other Dude: Looks we can make a break for it, Dude.

Dude: Sweet. Like plan of action?

Other dude: Go up the staircase, Dude.

Dude: Sweeeeet.

The Dude and the Other Dude are almost up the stairs when all of a sudden
a shape appears at the dorway.

Dude: Shit!

Other Dude: AHHHH!!!

Sasami: What's wrong with you people (not yet noticing the 2 guys) I've
been calling you for two hours! Dinner is rea- who on earth are you?!
(now she notices the 2 guys)
