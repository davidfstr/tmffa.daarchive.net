I hate saying this, but I have to. I DO NOT OWN TENCHI MUYO!!! PIONEER OWNS
IT! AND FUNimation OWNS DBZ!!!! OK, done. (But I did create Chi-ko Kiyato,
okay?) I apologise if this chapter is a bit slow. It's basically explaining
the current situations of everyone. K?

Chapter 1: A Woman called Chi-ko.

---Outer Space, Kiyone is having a hard time with Mihoshi---

"MIHOSHI!!!!!!!!!" Yelled the angry Kiyone.
"I'm sorry! WHA!!!! I'm sorry!" whined Mihoshi, crying.
Kiyone sighed. "You say that every time. Mihoshi. WHY didn't you pay
attention when they taught us how to use the replicator cubes?"
"It was boring......and....I...." Mihoshi faltered.
"So what if it was boring? Look what you did!"
Kiyone pointed at the screen, showing what was happening. Another Galaxy
Police patrol cruiser was stuck to theirs. Yukinojo suddenly came out.
"We have a transmission from the other ship."
"Okay. On screen." Kiyone said.
The screen opened up.
"HEY, WHATS THE BIG IDEA!??????" yelled the angry police officer. Kiyone and
Mihoshi fell over in shock.
"THERE I WAS, PATROLING MY AREA WHEN....BANG!!!! MY SHIPS STUCK TO
YOURS!!!!" He carried on yelling.
(Several minutes later)
"....NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND???" He finished.
"Er...Hello? Say something!"
"Ouch...." Said the two police women. Kiyone stood up.
"I'll get your ship unstuck."  She took out her replicator cube and after a
few minutes of swift twists and turns their ships were free.
"Thanks." Said the officer and he sped off.
Kiyone stretched.
"Well, we're done, why don't we go back to Earth?"
"YAY!!!" Cried Mihoshi, exited. "Then I'll be able to watch my favourite
show, Space Police Policemen!!!"
A bead of sweat formed on Kiyone's head. 'Why must I deal with this
alone...?' She thought, watching Her air-headed partner hop around. (A/N:I
am not making Mihoshi an airhead because I don't like her, she's my third
fave character. Its just she IS an airhead, I'm just using the T.V and Shin
version of Mihoshi which is more air-headed than the OVA one. I have to make
this fic funny somehow.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Meanwhile, on Earth, an explosion seemed to be happening in a house in
Okayama, Japan.---

"Ryoko, you demon woman!!!" Yelled Ayeka, stretching her mouth.
"You little snoop!!!" Retorted Ryoko, pulling on Ayeka's hair.
"WHAT???" Shouted the furious Ayeka. "I am Ayeka, the first crown princess
of the planet Jurai! You DARE to insult me?!?"
"Yes I do!!!!!!!"
Tenchi Masaki leaned against the wall, tears of exasperation pouring down
his face. Ryoko and Ayeka had been fighting since they first met on Earth.
That had to be, what, 9 years ago? It was all Tenchi and Sasami could do to
keep them apart.
"Oh, you are going to pay for that one, Ryoko!!!"
"And how are you going to make me pay, Princess Prissy?"
Sasami walked in, wearing her apron. Sasami was 17 now, and looked almost
exactly like Tsunami. The only difference was that the eblem on Sasami's
forehead was still triangular, not the two circles of Tsunami, meaning they
were still not fully merged. Ryo-Ohki was sitting on her head.
"Lunch is ready!" She said happily. Then she saw Ryoko and Ayeka. 'Uh
oh.....their at it again......' She thought. Sasami took off her apron, put
Ryo-Ohki on the floor and calmly stood between them, spreading her arms, one
holding back Ayeka and the other, Ryoko. It was quite an easy task, because
about 5 years ago Washu suggested that since Sasami would one day hold the
powers of a goddess, she should be ready to use them. So Ryoko began
training her in how to fly, create energy balls, and all the attacking
stuff. Ayeka taught her how to create shields, and various other defensive
techniques. Tenchi and Yosho taught her the Jurai sword techniques. When her
mother, Misaki, (Who is a very strong fighter - champion of Jurai) came to
visit, she taught her all she needed to know of Martial Arts. Now Sasami was
an immensely strong fighter, and the small task of separating Ryoko and her
sister was easy.
"Will you guys stop it? Lunch is ready! Man, and I'm meant to be the young
one!!!"
"Fine. Lets go eat."
"Yeah, I'm STARVING!!! Its all that beating you to a pulp, princess!"
"WHAT DID YOU SAY?"
Tenchi walked over to Sasami.
"Thanks, Sasami. Do you want me to get Washu?"
"Yes please, thank you, Tenchi."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Gohan? Gohan you better be studying, young man!"
Gohan did a very quick, yet quiet scramble to his desk to make it look like
he was studying. He hated studying on weekends. Chi-Chi wanted him to be a
great scholar, he didn't have a say in the matter. His mother came in.
"Oh, good. You are studying. I thought you were lounging around again! If
you're going to be a scholar you need to keep your grades up!"
"Yes, Mom." Gohan replied as Chi-Chi left the room.
It had been two months since the Majin Buu incident (A/N: I am currently
watching the Majin Buu Saga; I am only at the bit were Bulma and the others
collect the last Dragonball, so I have no idea how the crisis is stopped,
and who should be alive and who shouldn't, so in my fic Goku is alive, so is
Vegeta, and everyone else is, basically. Just wanted to let you know. I hate
living in England.) and he was still being controlled by his mother.'Man! I
AM 18 now! I can't believe I still have to listen to my mother!' he thought.
He sighed. He wanted to go and hang around with Videl. He said to her a
couple of days back that he would teach her the 'Kamehameha' and various
other ki blasts. It was boring, studying all the time. Chi-Chi wouldn't even
let him use the phone to call Videl and say he couldn't teach her the ki
blasts just yet. 'She's gonna think I make promises and don't keep them.
Dammit, Mom!' he thought.
"Hey Gohan!"
"Oh, hey, Dad."
"I just had a talk with your mother. I said you've been studying hard, you
deserve a break. It took some doing, but she said Videl can come over and
you can teach her all the stuff you said you would. Bad thing: you gotta
study twice as hard tomorrow."
"I don't care! Anything beats this on a Saturday!" and he picked up the
phone to call Videl.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ah, Mihoshi, Kiyone your back!!!"
Kiyone and her partner walked into the kitchen.
"Yup. How are you, Sasami?"
"I'm fine! I thought you might be coming home so I made you a plate!"
"Wow, thanks, Sasami!" Said Mihoshi happily.
"Miya, miya!"
As Mihoshi and Kiyone ate, they told Sasami about the ship incident. Sasami
laughed. "That sounded funny! I wish I could have seen it!!!"
Just then, Washu came in.
"Mihoshi, Kiyone, you have a transmission from the Galaxy Police HQ."
"Okay. Come ON, Mihoshi! It's bound to be important!"
The GP partners saluted in front of the screen.
"Detectives first class Mihoshi and Kiyone, reporting for duty, sir!"
"Yes." Said the chief. "You have been assigned a new partner."
"What?" said the women.
"Wha! Does this mean Kiyone's going to leave me?" sobbed Mihoshi.
Kiyone took this into account. 'Hmm....a new partner? YES!!! I have been
waiting for this! Now I might actually get a promotion!!!!' she thought
happily.
"No, you two will be staying partners, I am just assigning another partner
to you both."
Kiyone's dreams popped like a balloon.
"Her name is Chi-ko Kiyato, and she is a woman of about 23 who will be
joining you. She is from Jurai, and I think she knows the princesses. She
will be coming to Earth at about 5 'o clock, and you will be meeting her."
"YAY! We get a new partner Kiyone! A new friend!" said Mihoshi happily,
hopping around.
The chief turned to Kiyone.
"Kiyone..."He said quietly, " Half the reason I am doing this is so you get
a helping hand in controlling Mihoshi."
"Thank you, sir." replied Kiyone, saluting.
"I'll see you around."
The transmission ended.

 "Well, what was it?"
"We've been assigned a new partner."
"Who?" asked Sasami.
"Someone called Chi-ko Kiyato."
"Did you say Chi-ko Kiyato?" Said the two princesses. Kiyone nodded.
"My, Ayeka, we haven't seen her in a while!"
"Quite, Sasami!" Ayeka agreed.
"Hey, do you know her?" Tenchi asked.
"Yes, she is one of are dearest friends from Jurai. Her father is the
general of the Jurian army." Ayeka explained.
"Yeah, and we've missed her. She's a really good fighter too. She can do
most of the stuff Ryoko can do! I'll bet she'll be amazed to see me
fighting! I bet she'll just be amazed to see me! When is she coming?"
"At about 5 'o clock."
Sasami gasped. " In only two hours! I had better get a start on dinner!"
Sasami bustled to the kitchen, Ryo-Ohki following her.
"Miya, miya, miya!!!"
"Hah, I doubt this Chi-ko can do all the stuff I can!" Ryoko said proudly.
"Don't underestimate her, Ryoko. She is also related to the Jurai Royal
Family, so she can use Jurai power. And she CAN do all the things you can!"
"Oh yeah?"
Tenchi decided to steer the conversation away from the argument.
"She's related to the Royal Family? How?"
"She is my mothers cousins niece. Her full name is Chi-ko Kiyato Jurai, but
she usually misses out the Jurai part." explained Ayeka.
"Oh. I see. Well, I can't wait to meet her!"
"Ooh, yes, we all can't wait to meet the great Chi-ko Kiyato Jurai!" Ryoko
exclaimed sarcastically.
"Well get used to it Ryoko," Mihoshi said gleefully, "Because she's going to
be living here! If thats all right with Tenchi, of course!"
"Of course it is!" cried Tenchi. "Where else would she go?"
"Oh, wonderful! I must tell Sasami!"
Ayeka headed for the kitchen to tell Sasami that Chi-ko would be living
here. Sasami's cry of joy echoed through the house.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Oh! Almost! Keep trying, Videl!"
Gohan was teaching Videl the Kamehameha. She had flown over as soon as he
called her.
"Ka....me....ha....me....HA!!!!" Videl shouted as she thrust her hands
forward. An energy beam erupted from her hands.
"YEAH! You did it Videl!"
"All right!" Videl cried, punching the air.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was 5 'o clock. Chi-ko would arrive any minute. Ayeka, Sasami and Tenchi
where all waiting, wearing their best Jurai robes. Ryoko was there too, but
instead of looking exited, as the princesses did, she looked bored. Tenchi
looked nervous. He was always nervous when a stranger was coming, but it
made him even more nervous that the stranger would be living here. Kiyone
and Mihoshi were in their uniforms. Kiyone nervous about what her new
partner would be like, Mihoshi, exited. She was hopping around again. Washu
was also here, curious about Chi-ko, and her powers. She swore she wouldn't
do any experiments on her to the others. Yosho and Noboyuki were here, too,
to see what she was like. Yosho remembered Chi-ko as a little girl, but he
wondered what she would be like now. Ryo-Ohki was contentedly sitting on
Sasami's shoulder, meowing happily.
"I hope she gets here soon," said Sasami, excitement in her voice. "I don't
want the dinner to get cold."
"I just can't wait to see her." Ayeka replied. They waited a couple more
minutes.
"Hey....do you guys hear that?" Ryoko asked.
"Yes..." They all replied.
"Sister! Look up there Ayeka!" Sasami exclaimed, pointing. They all looked.
"Its her! She's here!!!" cried Sasami. "But wait....Ayeka, sister....isn't
that Mother's ship?"
Ayeka looked. It was indeed her mothers ship, Karin.
"Oh, dear..." sighed Ayeka.
Karin touched down on the lake, and a bridge opened up to the bank. Misaki
came running out.
"Oh! My sweet little Ayeka! My darling little Sasami! I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE
YOU!!!" She exclaimed.
She ran over and hugged her daughters like hell.
"Ow! Mom!" Sasami yelled.
"Mother!" Cried Ayeka.
"Oh, I haven't seen you in YEARS!!!" Misaki cried. "I'VE MISSED YOU SO
MUCH!!!!" She finally released her daughters and hugged everyone else.
"Mihoshi! Kiyone! Tenchi! Yosho! Noboyuki! Washu! Ryoko!" She said as she
hugged everyone.
"Oh, Sasami, you've grown so much!!!"
"Mom, is Father here?"
"No, Sasami, he's busy, so's your aunt Funaho. This means I can stay for a
while! Is that OK? Because if its not I'll sleep in my ship. I just want to
spend time with my girls!"
"Of course its ok!" Said Yosho.
"Mom, is Chi-ko here?"
"Yes, yes she is. Chi-ko! You can come out you know!!!"
A person started to walk across the bridge. Tenchi's first impression was:
WHOA! She was very pretty. Chi-ko had long, black hair and black eyes. Her
hair reached to the floor and was tied in a plait. She wore Jurai robes and
was carrying a large bag. Her eyes were to the floor. She looked up. She saw
Ayeka and Sasami beaming at her. She grinned. Chi-ko dropped her bag and ran
towards them.
"CHI-KO!" They yelled and ran towards her. They hugged her in turn.
"We're so happy to see you!"
Chi-ko grinned.
"You guys! I haven't seen you in ages! In the name of Tsunami, you've grown
so much Sasami! How long has it been? 9 years? Goddesses, we have a lot of
catching up to do!" She turned to everyone else and bowed. "My name is
Chi-ko. Its a pleasure to meet you all."
"Let me introduce you to everyone!" Sasami beamed.
"This is Tenchi, and this is Ryoko, and Washu, and Yosho, and father
Noboyuki, and your two partners, Mihoshi and Kiyone."
"Hi!" They all said.
"Wow, so you're our new partner? Cool! But you don't look like a police
officer in your Jurai ro- OW!!!"
Mihoshi was cut short by Kiyone hitting her round the head.
"It doesn't matter Mihoshi!"
Chi-ko looked from one to the other, a bemused look on her face. Ayeka went
up to her.
"Don't mind them....Mihoshi's a bit dim, and Kiyone has to try to control
her. Lets go in shall we? I'll show you your room!"
"OK!"
"So, you're Chi-ko are you?"
Ryoko appeared next to them.
"You don't look so strong. They think you're as strong as me, but I doubt
that!"
"Oh really? You're Ryoko, aren't you? Hey, I know how strong you are. But I
also know how strong I am!"
"Little Ryoko, are you criticising Chi-ko before you've seen what she can
do?"
Washu walked up too.
"STOP CALLING ME THAT!"
Ayeka tugged on Chi-ko's arm.
"Come on, lets go, before this gets ugly. Azaka! Kamedaki!"
The two guardians appeared at her side.
"Yes ma'am!"
"Azaka, please take Chi-ko's bags to her room. Kamedaki, please take
anything my mother wants into the house."
As the two guardians set about their orders, Ayeka, Sasami and Chi-ko
followed the others into the house.


 Everyone was eating dinner. Sasami and Ayeka sat either side of Chi-ko,
telling her everything that happened in the past 9 years.
"....you see, and Mihoshi set Washu free and Ryoko was fighting Kagato but
not at full power because Ayeka would have shrivelled up from the
counter-flow of the energy...."
They continued on like this throughout the meal.
"Wow, Sasami, I never knew you cooked! It's really good!"
"Oh my, thank you!"
After the meal Chi-ko and Misaki helped Sasami clean up.
"Hey, you guys...I'm going for a walk, okay?"
"Where are you going, Sasami?" Misaki inquired.
"Oh, for a walk. I'll tell you when I get back."
"Okay sister. I'll show Chi-ko her room."

 Sasami walked up the stairs leading to the Masaki shrine. She turned off on
a side path and walked through the woods until she came to the cave Ryoko
was once imprisoned in. Sasami walked in, and went to a kind of machine a
little way in.
"Hello, Yugi."
Sasami came to a stop infront of the machine.
"You've been in there a long time. I know you're staying in there until you
are mature enough to control your powers, but I never thought it would take
seven years."
Sasami had been 10 years old when she met Yugi, and after a while Yugi
decided to sleep until she was able to control her powers. Sasami set
Ryo-Ohki on the ground.
"Well anyway, I came here to tell you about my day like I always do. Its
been a really great day today, because my friend Chi-ko came to live with
us. She's really cool, I know you'll love her Yugi! She's a really good
fighter, and funny, and she's great fun at karaoke. I can't wait till you
come out, Yugi, I know we'll have lots of fun. I can show you how well I can
fight!"
Sasami continued talking to Yugi a few more minutes.
"Well, thats my report for today, Yugi, I'll see you tomorrow."
Sasami picked up Ryo-Ohki again and made her way back to the house.

 Ayeka was waiting for Sasami outside with Chi-ko.
"Went to see Yugi?"
"Yeah, I felt like seeing her."
"I've told Mother and Chi-ko about her, so you needn't worry, sister." Ayeka
said.
"Thanks, Ayeka."
"Hey, I've put all my stuff in my room. How 'bout some karaoke?" Chi-ko said
happily.
"Yeah! Sure! That sounds fun! I love it when you sing Chi-ko, you're so
good!"
Chi-ko blushed.
"Oh, Sasami! Don't! I've gone all red!"
"Did someone say karaoke?"

 Washu was singing.
" Sit back and listen to this song that I'm singin',
Photon, Proton, Synchrotron are interesting
Science is better than love can ever be,
Falling in love is based on chaotic theory!
 Emotions are exhausting,
Quantum mechanics never ever make you frown
With scientific methods,
Imaginary walls will come tumbling down, yeah!"
A bead of sweat formed on everyone's heads.
"Don't worry, Chi-ko, Washu's obsessed with science."
"I....think I gathered that...."
Washu launched into a lecture of quantum mechanics.
"Listen, through his experiments, Heisenberg concluded that the accurate
measurements of one of two related observable quantities, such as position
and momentum, produces uncertainties in the measurements of the other. He
figured that the product of the uncertainties of position and the
uncertainties of momentum are equal to or greater than h over 2 pi, where h
equals Plank's constant. It means that observations in quantum mechanics
always lead to uncertainty. You understand this, don't you?"
"Er....uh...huh?"
"Not at all."
"Its hopeless."
"Hey, Chi-ko, sing!" Sasami said happily.
"Yes, Chi-ko, please do!" Ayeka agreed.
"Oh, but....what shall I sing?"
"Sing....erm....uh....how about....I know! Sing I Am A Pioneer!"
"Oh...alright...."
Chi-ko walked over and picked up the microphone. She was such a shade of
scarlet that her face looked like fire.
"Yay Chi-ko! Oh come on, you love to sing!"
The music started and Chi-ko began to sing.
"Did you know? I am a pioneer....
I'm out on a secret mission,
I travel the galaxy, and far beyond...."

 Chi-ko was finishing her song.
"Its our destiny to be pioneers,
We'll always be moving forward, our courage is what we will be counting on,
We will be pioneers forevermore."
"Wow, Sasami and Ayeka weren't kidding, you ARE good!"
Just then, Mihoshi, Kiyone and Chi-ko's GP wrist things started to beep.
"Hey, we've gotta transmission!"
They pressed a button. The chiefs angry face appeared.
"HEY, DETECTIVE CHI-KO!!! WHY DID'NT YOU SAY YOU WERE PART OF THE JURAI
ROYAL FAMILY?!?"
He carried on, saying that a Jurai royal couldn't be in the GP.
"And whyever not?"
"Oh! Princess Ayeka! Princess Sasami!"
"If Chi-ko wants to be in the Galaxy Police, she is." Ayeka stated.
"Do you want to be, Chi-ko?" Sasami asked.
"Well, yeah!"
"Well its settled."
"I'm afraid not. Only Emperor Azusa or one of the queens can say she can."
Misaki stood up.
"She can."
"AH! Queen Misaki! I didn't know you were here!"
"Does that matter? I'm saying that she can be in the Galaxy Police."
"But Queen Misaki..."
"Miss Washu? Could you please...?"
Washu got out her laptop and created an inter-dimensional tunnel.
"Way ahead of ya."
"Thank you."
Misaki reached in, and pulled the startled chief out, lifting him by his
mouth.
"You were saying?"
"I was saying that of COURSE Lady Chi-ko can be in the Galaxy Police!"
"Please, don't call me 'Lady'."
"Good. I'm glad we understand each other." Misaki smiled warmly at the
chief, then threw him through the tunnel. Washu closed it.
"Well, it's my turn now!" exclaimed Misaki, picking up the mic. She began to
sing 'Your Hiroshi'.

 They were all unaware that they were being watched.
*How foolish...* said a voice that sounded like it didn't belong anywhere.
*My sisters....whatever compelled you to do the things you have? You have
discarded immortality; you are mere mortals! Sister Washu...why do you live
with them? Oh well...no matter...soon they shall not exist. Sister
Tsunami...did you lose your mind those 700 years ago? Why did you merge
yourself with that worthless girl? I must work quickly...to fulfil my plan
they must not become fully merged...* the voice said to itself.
"Lady Tokimi?" said a voice that sounded more human; though only slightly.
*Be gone! I have planning to do.*
"Yes, my Lady."
And with that, the dark goddess Tokimi began to laugh: a sound that would
make even Vegeta shiver because of the evil.
*Soon...it will all happen soon....*
And she continued to laugh.
