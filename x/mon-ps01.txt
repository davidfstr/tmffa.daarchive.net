Monstra:  Tenchi Muyo!

 An Unexpected Fight.

==========

November 3rd, 2198, 8:00 p.m.

        I weep when I think of what happened.  200 years ago, she was taken.
Frozen in time, she knows nothing of what is going on.  I felt so
helpless at the time.  If it were 12 years later, things would be
different.  My power could've easily prevented a war zone.

        Technology has stopped evolving, life has become scarce in some places,
and cities have been destroyed.  Daylight has become a haven, and the
darkness an enemy.  Once, people were lively and at the peak of
humanity.  Now, they have become like animals.

        It may look like I stayed out of the fight, but in truth, I have not.
Now, the fruits of my labor will finally be blooming.

==========

        Monstra looks out towards the city.  "I can't believe I have ruled this
world for 200 years."  Looking at the encased Sasami, "it has been fun.
I wonder how long it will last?"

        "Not long if you keep underestimating the Bloodhawks," Tenchi responds.

        "Do you think they can beat me?"  Looking at him, "or are you hopeful?
Is my spell on you wearing off?"

        "I have every hope to see you after every battle," Tenchi says.

        "How sweet!  Let me reward your kindness," she says, pulling him into
the bedroom.

========

        A long ways away, "now that they are gone, I can start."  Closing her
eyes, Tsunami builds up her power, and starts to release it.

========

        On Earth, the crystal around Sasami cracks as her eyes open.  The
crystal shatters, and she's free.  <Run, Sasami!>

        Unfortunately, because her muscles have been frozen for the past 200
years, she collapses.  <I can't move.  I'm too stiff.>

        <Try, Sasami.  If you don't, Monstra will put you back in there.>

        <Okay.>  Standing, she starts to stumble down the hallway.  Soon, as
her muscles are stretched more, she can run again.  <What is this place,
Tsunami?>

        <You are in Monstra's castle.>

========

        Monstra, thinking something is wrong, morphs some clothing on her and
walks out.  Seeing the crystal, "Tenchi!  She's free!  We must find
her!"

========

        Sasami, hiding in a dark corner, <Tsunami, what happened?>

        <After you were encased, Monstra left most of the world's heroes
powerless.  A few even died.>

        <And then what happened?>

        <Monstra betrayed her heritage in order to lead the Renegade Monster
Clans throughout the world.  With them, She has destroyed it.  Many died
after that.  The rest of the people became like animals.>

        <Where is Ayeka?  And Misa?  What happened to Tenchi?!>

        <Ayeka and Yosho are here on Jurai.  But, Tenchi has become Monstra's
slave.  Misa, though, has chosen to stay on Earth.  But, I do not know
where she is.>

        <What about the others?>

        <Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki are in space.  Washu has sealed herself in her lab.
And, Mihoshi and Kiyone returned to Galaxy Police Headquarters.>

        <So, it's just me?  Of our family, I am the only one left here?>

        <Yes.  When Monstra encased you, she made it impossible for you to
leave Earth.  If you were taken, you would have died in that crystal.>

        <Now that I'm free, now what?>

        <Jurai would never get there fast enough before Monstra found you.
Your only chance is to fight.  If you can hold her off long enough, I
can pick you up myself.>

        <And if I beat her, the planet will start to heal itself.  But, how do
I fight her?>

        <With this.>  From Sasami's forehead marks, a beam of light hits the
floor.  When it fades, a baton with a heart on the end of it is formed.

        <You can't be serious!>  Sasami says.  <You want me to be her again?>

        <That alternative reality you were in had the possibility of coming
true.  She is an extension of my power.>

        Picking it up, <it looks a little different.>

        <That's because it is for a different version of her.>

        <A different one?>

        <Yes.  This is a better version.  Of course, you will be in control.>

        <How is she better?>

        <She's a bit more mature than the other one.>

        <Alright.  I'll fight.>

        <Good.  Now, repeat after me...>

        "Pretty Mutation!  Magical Recall!"  Sasami can feel the change as her
pajamas are replaced by an odd costume.

========

        Monstra, walking through her palace, <she hasn't left.  There's only
one way out, and it's guarded.  Milak said he didn't see her.>

        "Did you find her?" Tenchi asks, catching up to her.

        "No," she replies.  "She's here somewhere.  Milak hasn't seen anyone
pass through the door in the past two hours."

        "That's pretty hard, considering Milak practically IS the door.   So,
any ideas?"

        "I think she's running around so as to avoid us.  If we stay in one
place, she'll come to us."

        "Where?"

        "She's trying to get out.  So, we stand near the exit, and cloak
ourselves.  When she runs for the door, we grab her."

========

        <Sasami, Monstra is hiding at the exit.>

        <So, what do I do?>

        <It's time to fight, Sasami.>

        <Right.>

========

        Monstra, cloaked, hears small footsteps running towards her.  <Alright.
Time to settle this.>

        As Pretty Sammy turns the corner, she stops.  <She's here, somewhere.
So, now what?>

        <What the heck is this?> Monstra thinks.  <What in the world is she
wearing?>

        "Monstra!  I know you're here!" Sammy yells.  "Come out!"

        Appearing, "you're just full of surprises.  First, you're linked to
Tsunami, and now you're some kind of heroine!"

        "I'm Pretty Sammy.  And I'm here to restore the world."

        "Not while I'm around, girlie."

        "I can change that."  Holding up her baton, "Pretty Croquettish
BOMBER!" she yells, sending off a shockwave.

        Tenchi jumps in front of the blast, protecting Monstra from it.

        "Tenchi?  What are you doing?" Sammy inquires.

        <Tenchi's on her side, Sasami.>

        <What?  No!>

        "Surprised, Sasami?  Did I take your Tenchi from you?" Monstra says
sarcastically.

        "You monster!"

        "No.  MonsTRA!" she yells, sending her own shockwave at Sammy.

        She blocks it with her staff, and absorbs it.  Then, she swings her
baton like a bat, "right back at you!"

        Monstra leaps away, but Tenchi takes the full blast.  On impact, he is
thrown through the door, unconcious.

        "Now, I'm mad!"  Monstra yells, charging.  Swinging her Moon Blade, it
is met by Sasami's baton.

        Though she hasn't had any training, Sammy keeps Monstra back.  "I can't
lose.  There's too much at stake."

        "There's nothing at stake," Monstra states.  "I've already won!  I just
want to make sure certain people stay out of my way."  Pushing her back,
"and you are one of them."

        "If there's any hope that I can win, I will," Sammy says, charging
back.

        After a couple of clashes, "that's just it.  There is no hope left.
Because I have destroyed it," she states, slicing Pretty Sammy's staff
in two.

        Sasami watches in horror as the heart, that was once on her baton,
slides across the floor.  "No!" she yells as her power fades.

        "Now, you are finished."

        Sasami, back in her pajamas, <what now, Tsunami?>

        <I'm sorry.  I don't know what to do.>

        "Now, Sasami," Monstra says, "time to go back to bed."

        Monstra, pointing her sword at Sasami, "now, sit still."  Black energy
comes forth from her sword.  As it engulfs the little girl, she closes
her eyes.

        as Tenchi walks back in, he sees the crystal.  "It's over?"

        "Yes.  She won't bother us anymore."

========

        On Jurai, Tsunami watches the conclusion.  <Well, I've done all I can.
I can only hope that someone can defeat Monstra.>
