                         Tenchi of the Wind?
                             Chapter 1
                      (Ryoko's dream come true)

"So Ryoko, your the only one up?" said Tenchi. "Yes, I am. Hey Tenchi, lets
go for a walk, what do you say?" asked Ryoko. "Ok, lets go Ryoko!"
Tenchi replied.
So the two started off.
"What a nice morning!" said Ryoko. "Yes, it is." Tenchi sighed. "Tenchi,"
Ryoko asked,"can I show you something?" "Sure, go ahead. "Hold on Tenchi,
this might be fast!" They were in the air faster then Tenchi could say "Stop
Ryoko!"
Then they disappeared to a remote place.
"Tenchi, we're here!" shouted Ryoko. "Why are we here Ryoko?" asked Tenchi.
"Because I want to ask you something." "Ask away."
"Tenchi, will you marry me?"
Tenchi was shocked. "Is this because of Ayeka?" "No, I loved you before she
showed up, remember?" "In that case, as long as it doesn't get out of
hand...... well, yes Ryoko." Ryoko was more shocked than Tenchi. "Thank you,
oh, thank you Tenchi!" she yelled over and over. Then she cried. She and
Tenchi held each other for a while.

Meanwhile, back at Tenchi's place......

"Where is Lord Tenchi? Someone tell me!" Ayeka shouted. "Tenchi nor Ryoko
are here." said Sasami. "Tenchi and Ryoko are gone? Oh, when I get my hands
on that woman...." Ayeka thought.
Soon everyone was wondering where Tenchi and Ryoko were.
"Maybe they eloped or something?" Washu suggested.
Ayeka fainted. A half-hour later, Tenchi returned. Ayeka, just waking back
up, said "Tenchi! Where were you? I was so worried about you! Hey, where is
Ryoko?" "She's outside," Tenchi replied.
Ayeka stepped outside only to see Ryoko flying happily.
"Ayeka, Ayeka! I'm sooo happy!" she shouted. "About what? Tell me NOW!"
Ayeka said jealously. "Ayeka, I'm sorry about all the trouble I every caused
you." "Ryoko, why are you acting like this?" "I'm, well.... I had
some...er... good news." "What good news?" "I'm sure you don't what to know
right now Ayeka."
