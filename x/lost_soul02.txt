now, for the reason why ryoko left 
  

it had been 3 weeks sense tenchi left, and all hell had broke lose.
Ryoko was sick and had told no one.
 Aeka was being even more snotty.
 Sasami cooked less. 
Washu worked on that thing day in day out so they could see tenchi. And 
keyione and mihosie weren't back yet. 
When ryoko put the pencil down she really did go see washu, after 
throwing up one last time.
 "washu!!!!washu!!!" ryoko yelled out for her at the top of her 
lounge's. just then a small washu doll was at her feet 
"what do you want?" ryoko said, sounding a bit more like the old her, 
cold and mean 
"if you want to talk ya got to say the magic word" 
"fine" she grumbled as she yelled once more
 "mom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" washu popped in front of her 
"yes?" 
"i." she hated admitting she was sick.
"just tell me" 
"I don't fell that well. I throw up about 7 to 10 time's every morning 
lately"  
"well, at lest you told me, I mean, you could have anything"
"that makes me fell sooo much better" ryoko said in a fake voice "well, 
come on then" washu said as she grabbed her darter's arm

 
"all done" washu said after doing 5 tests 
"already?" ryoko sounded more worryed then anything, she wanted to she 
her tenchi again. 
"yes, now go, they'll be done by tonight" so she left.            

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That night sasami cooked for the first time in two days
 "bone-appetite every one!" sasami said as she laid five(washu was 
still in her lab)plate's full of food at each person when washu ran in, 
looking half happy and half mad, and looked right at ryoko 
"I know whats wrong"
 "huh? Is ryoko ok?????" sasami sound as worried as ryoko was "nothing 
accept she pragnet, and im very mad and sort of happy." Ryoko went into 
one of those anime stone phases and aeka screamed 
"what!???!!!!!!??????????!!!!?!?!?!?!?!? wait, why am I worrying, its 
not like it could be tenchi's" she looked at washu 
"it is't, right?" washu shook her head 
"its tenchi's, I know that by two thing's, one, she is passed out, two, 
I did blood tests"
 "YAY! there's gonna be a baby in the house!" sasami yelled this out as 
thou they all just won a million dollars each 
"would you shut up?" aeka said in a cold voice to her now tearing 
sister 
"leave her be aeka, its not her fault" ryoko said as she flew out the 
roof 
"now where's she off to" washu said as she walked out.
?	*breeeeeeeeing.* 
?	*breeeeeeing.*(tenchi's voice on the phone)
?	 "sorry im gone right now but leave a message" 
?	"uhhh, hi tenchi, I need to tell you.. uhhh. ya know when we, uhhh, 
well ya know last time well.ya see.uhhh.im" *beeeeeeep.* ryoko put 
the phone down and picked it back up and started to dial tenchi's 
number again 
?	"hello ryoko" aeka had been behind her the hole time 
?	"why are you trying to tell tenchi?"
?	 "because he needs to know aeka, now shut up"
?	"but he doesn't care, he loves me"
?	"sure he does aeka, just go away"
?	"but he does, we've been together since forever,
?	"the only reason he ever even talked to you those nights is because 
we made a bet"
?	"would you shut up?"
?	"yep, I bet him he couldn't win you over like it was true, looks 
like he won" aeka walk away laughing
?	 <tenchi, how could you?> 
?	^...^ ryoko, her now mixed feeling's, made her cry as she flew up 
stares, as she packed, and as she left with every thing but the book 
she had been reading from that unfaithful night, and a piece of 
paper that, before, made her think of her and tenchi.





Poor ryoko, but is it true? Find out in act 3: if we must ^-^
   
All due respect,
Rini^-^
