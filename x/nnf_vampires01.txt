Crossover
The Secret War-Chapter 1-"Infected"
Tenchi and the others are invited to a party;which is located on vampire
feeding grounds!Tenchi and Blade X-over.

Noboyuki:Tenchi,can you go and get the mail please?
Tenchi:Sure.
Tenchi headed for the door,got his shoes on,and went out the door.He was
about to get to the mailbox when Ryoko jumped off the roof and landed behind
Tenchi.She gently set her hands on his shoulders and began to massage
them.This scared Tenchi at first,but it felt good,so he didn't say
anything.Ryoko didn't hear any complaning.She smiled;she may have won Tenchi
over!
Ayeka:Ryoko!Take your hands off Lord Tenchi this instant!
Tenchi:Uh-oh...
Ryoko and Tenchi turned to find Ayeka,stomping towards them with a
vengeance.
Ryoko:What is your problem,Ayeka?Tenchi is enjoying what I'm doing,weren't
you Tenchi?
Tenchi:Huh?Yeah,I guess so...
Ryoko:You heard it with your own ears.So go and scratch a tree or something.
Ayeka:You must have drugged him!
Ryoko:What did you just say,Ayeka?
Ayeka:You know exactly what I said,you filthy whor...
Ryoko(teleports in front of Ayeka,with he** in her eyes.):Filthy WHAT?
As the two of them fought,Tenchi silently walked over to the mailbox.He
pulled the mail out.Only one.Oh well.He looked at it.He froze
instantley.Ryoko noticed Tenchi just standing there.She pointed at him,and
Ayeka looked at him.They both snuck over and peeked over the letter at
Tenchi's face.It was as pale as a ghost.
Ayeka:What's wrong,Lord Tenchi?
Ryoko:Who's it for?
Tenchi:It's for you,Ryoko.
Ryoko:What?!But no one knows I'm here!Who's it from?
Tenchi:It doesn't say.
Ryoko floated in the air with her legs crissed-crossedShe took the letter
and began to read outloud.

                                                    Dear Ryoko,
                                                          You are invited to
a party.Attached to this letter is a device that your mother,Washu,
                                                          should be able to
decipher.It contains the place.Come tomorrow from 8:00 P.M. to
4:30 A.M.
                                                          You may bring
friends,just be sure to know who your friends are.There will be a
doorman at the entrance.You will need a password to get in.The password is
SWORDFISH.We hope to see you there.

                                                          P.S.:You may bring
Sasami if you like,but not Ryo-oki.The doorman will kill her.NO
pets allowed.

By now,Tenchi,Ryoko and Ayeka were already inside the house.Everyone else
had gathered for breakfast.
Tenchi:Should we go?
Washu:What's all the commotion about?
Ayeka:We have been invited to a party.
Sasami:Really?From who?
Tenchi:It doesn't say.
Noboyuki:Nonsense!Let me see that.
Ryoko handed him the envelope it had came in.He checked it,and,with a
sigh,gave it back to Ryoko.
Noboyuki:It doesn't say after all.
Washu:Let me read it.Hey,what's this attached to it?
Tenchi:Read it.
Washu read the letter to everyone else.When she finished,everyone was
silent.
Washu:I'm going to go scan this sucker.
Washu ran into her lab to translate the device.
Mihoshi:Wait a minute.If whoever sent this knows all about
Ryoko,Washu,Sasami and Ryo-oki,that means that...
Everyone leanded forward to hear Mihoshi's suspicion.
Mihoshi:...That must mean they are really good at guessing!
Everyone:Mihoshi!
Washu pops out of her lab.
Washu:I couldn't find out who sent this letter,but I did find the location.
Kiyone:If it is a trap,we can get out of it,right?We beat Kagato and
K.A.I.N.So,how hard could this be?
Ryoko:She has a good point.I say we go.
Ayeka:So we go?
Tenchi:We go.

************************************************

The next day,at 9:30 P.M.

Everyone except for Kiyone and Washu were in the living room,watching T.V.
before it was time to leave.Ryoko was sitting next to Tenchi,Ayeka and
Sasami on the other couch,and Mihoshi at the table,having a snack.Ryoko had
been up
all night last night making adjustments to the Yagami with help from
Washu;LOTS of it.She also had to explain to Ryo-oki
why she couldn't come with Sasami.She was too tired to stay awake much
longer.Finally,she rested her head on Tenchi's shoulder.Ayeka,as usual,was
infuriated.
Ayeka:And just what do think you are doing,Ryoko?
Ryoko:What does it look like?I'm taking a nap.
With all her energy spent,she zonked out.Ayeka was NOT about to stand by and
watch this proceed.
Ayeka:Lord Tenchi.I am going to have to ask you to move,so I can exterminate
this...creature.
Tenchi:Leave her alone Ayeka.
Ayeka:What?
Tenchi:She was up all night last night working.So just let her sleep.
Ayeka:.........Oh,very well.
Ayeka:"If she thinks she has won,I'll show her what's what!She'll regret
ever laying eyes on Tenchi"

In the cockpit

Washu:Right there,that's the place.
Kiyone(Yawns):What time is it?
Washu:It's 11:00.
Kiyone:I'll go get the others.
Washu(Yawns):You do that.

************************************************

Tenchi:Wake up Ryoko.
Ryoko:Hmm...Huh?What?
Tenchi:It's time to go.
Ryoko:Oh.Thanks,Tenchi.
Kiyone:Is everyone ready?
Washu:As ready as I'll ever be.
Ayeka:Might as well get it over with.
Sasami:I'm ready!
Mihoshi:Roger!
Tenchi:Yeah,I guess.
Ryoko:Let's do it!
Kiyone:I guess we're ready,Washu.
Washu:Give me a sec.
Washu called up her portable labtop and hit a few keys.A door appeared in
front of them.The door slid open.The labtop dissapeared and Washu announced:
Washu:It's ready!Let's go!
Everyone took a step into the doorway.When they got to the other side,they
found themselves in a hallway.At the end of the hall was a doorman.They
casully approuched him.Before they came on this trip,Washu gave them small
earpieces that would let them understand,write,and speak all languages know
to man.That way,they would be able to go.
Doorman:What's the password?
Tenchi:Swordfish.
Doorman:Welcome.
He opened the door next to him.Inside was the party.All the lights were
turned out,except for a few lights on the ceiling.A large number of people
were inside,dancing to loud rock music.Tenchi and the others cautiously
entered.Using scanners,
Washu and Kiyone searched for traps,weapons,anything that may be a threat to
them.But the scanners didn't pick up
anything.
Washu:Nothin'.Not a frickin' thing.
Kiyone:Same here.I guess it's just a party.
Tenchi:Maybe not.
Washu:What do you mean?
Tenchi:I think I saw a weapon.I'll be right back.
Tenchi followed where he thought he saw a sword,which usually meant Nagi.He
found the source,and sighed to see that it was just the D.J.,wearing a wierd
headset made of metal.Suddenly,someone grabbed his hand.He turned around.
Ryoko:Come on Tenchi.Let's dance!
Tenchi:But what if Ayeka sees us?
Ryoko:I sent her on a little search.
Ayeka:Ryoko!What do you think your'e doing?!
Ryoko:Wow,that was quick.
Ayeka:Oh,boy.
Tenchi:What is it?
Ayeka:It's almost here!
Ryoko:What is?
As if on cue,the music increased A LOT.The other people were raising their
hands to the ceiling and shouting,as if they
were coaxing an animal out of a hole.Ayeka was doing the same.The others had
found them and rushed over and was
asking Ayeka what she was doing,but the music was too loud.Tenchi tried his
luck.
Tenchi:WHAT ARE YOU DOING,AYEKA?
Ayeka:IT'S HERE!
Again,as if on cue,the emergency sprinklers on the ceiling started,spraying
all over the place.Tenchi saw the others screaming and running away.Tenchi
was about to ask why when he noticed something wrong.The entire room was
covered
in red.Tenchi noticed the same stuff coming out of the sprinklers.That's
when it clicked in his head what the red stuff was.
It was blood.
Tenchi screamed as he looked down at himself,covered in blood.He looked up
to find himself staring at Ayeka.
Ayeka:IS SOMETHING WRONG?HIISSS!
Tenchi felt something hit him on the back of the head,and everything went
black.

************************************************

...

.........?

The first thing Tenchi noticed when he woke up was he couldn't move.He found
he was chained to a wall.On opposite walls,the others were already awake.But
he didn't see Ayeka or Ryoko.Tenchi did see that the room he was in was
enirely
white,with a black circle in the middle of the floor.Even the...
SLAM!
Tenchi froze.
He heard footsteps coming to the door.The door swung open.And out came a man
in his late twenties.He had brown hair,
green eyes,and was average-sized.His arms were muscular,but not like
weight-lifter muscular.He wore a blue shirt and black jeans.Behind him was
Ayeka,twenty men,and ten girls.
Tenchi:Who are you?
?????:My name is Dylan Frost.It's an honor to finally meet you,Tenchi.
Washu:What have you done with Ryoko?
Dylan:She's right here.
Dylan pulled a small remote out of his pocket.He pressed a button,and the
black circle in the middle of the floor extened
out until it was revealed to be a tube.Inside was an unconcious Ryoko.The
glass of the tube opened and Ryoko fell with
a thud.
Tenchi:Ryoko!
Washu:What have you done to her?
Dylan:I think the real wuestion is...what am I going to do to her.
With that,Dylan opened his mouth,and two fangs came forth.He got on his
knees,smiling.He opened his mouth,hissed,and then sank his fangs into
Ryoko's neck.Sucking noises could be herd.After four seconds of this,he
pulled his teeth out of
Ryoko,who was still asleep.
Dylan:Now,it's your turn.
Dylan pressed another button,and the chains dropped them to the
ground.Kiyone & Mihoshi reached for their guns,but found they weren't
there.The same thing was happening to Tenchi,with his sword.They looked up
to see Ayeka was holding them.As the mob of freaks came closer,Tenchi tried
to activate the Light Hawk Wings.Dylan only laughed.
Dylan:Try all you want.Ayeka already explained your habit of calling the
Light Hawk Wings.And I got someone to make
a shield that weakens your powers.
Kiyone:You'll pay for this!
Dylan:Say what you want,here we come!
BOOM!
The wall on Tenchi's right suddenly exploded,throwing debris everywhere.In
the hole of the wall was a man in black.When I say that,I don't just mean
his skin,I mean all of his clothes,too.Black jacket,a black vest underneath
with silver locks across the front,black boots,black gloves,and black
gloves.He smirked and raised a machine gun.
Man 1:The daywalker!
Ayeka:Hiiisss!
Dylan:Blade's here.
Blade:Catch you fu**ers at a bad time?
Dylan:Attack!
Blade squeezed the trigger,shooting bullets at Man 1.He fell and
disentegrated into dust.He shot down three more,then he ran out of
ammo.Cursing to himself for not bring more ammunition,he threw the gun into
his jacket and pulled out a shotgun.He took aim and fired.A 17 year-old girl
dissappeared instantly.He took out four more,who had gotten too close.
Somehow,a 21 year-old woman got to him and punched him in the face.He came
back & struck her in the stomach with the shotgun's butt end.Having cocked
the gun,he shot her in the chin.She exploded.A guy behind her hit the
shotgun away,
only to have Blade stab him in the chest with a silver stake.But there were
still too many of them.Blade performed a backflip & landed away from the mob
of insane freaks.He simply smirked.
Blade:Only twenty more to go.
Dylan:You can't keep this up forever!You'll tire out!
Blade:Spoke too soon.
With that,Blade pulled out a sword from a holster in the back of his
jacket.He ran,did a frontflip,twisted in the air,and landed behind the army
of vampires.Using momentum,he twirled around and sliced two in half.Like the
others,they disentagrated.He twisted his body half-way and stabbed a girl in
the shoulder blade.He twirled the opposite direction,
ducked,then cut three of their legs off.By the time they hit ground,he
jumped up and decapitated them.He jumped upward,
but sliced downward.Three more were sliced across the face.When he
landed,the vampires tried their luck at attacking.He stabbed one
more,then,due to sheer numbers,he retreated backward.He peered up and smiled
like the devil himself would.
Blade:Make that ten.
Dylan:You forgot me.
Blade:Oh,don't worry.I wouldn't forget about you.
He ran at the hord of freaks.He killed four more,than a guy hit his sword
away.He kicked him in the stomach,then uppercutted him with a silver stake
in the chin.Then,the vampires made a circle around him.Blade counted his
foes.
Blade:One...two...six.Not a problem.
He wiped out what looked like a boomerang with a curved blade on each end.He
threw the boomerang and less than two seconds later,caught it again.Tenchi
was about to protest that he missed,but the blade had penetrated so cleanly
through
that it took three seconds after being hit for them to disentagrate.Blade
put it away and ran for his sword.But Ayeka got to it first,and acting as if
an expert,she twirled the sword in a pro's fashion.Blade only watched.When
Ayeka finished,she looked up and hissed.Right after that,the sword activated
its defense mechnism,spikes errupting out of the bottom of the hilt.Ayeka's
hand exploded,and the sword fell to the ground.Blade kicked it up and caught
it in his right hand.He twirled
around and cut downward,cutting the rest of what was left of Ayeka's hand
and her arm.She fell,defeated,but not dead.
Dylan ran out of the room in fear.Blade suddenly noticed Tenchi and the
others were there.
Blade:Let's go.
Blade led the others out of the hole he had created for his door.On the
other side was a van.Tenchi,with Ryoko in his arms,got into the van.The
others soon followed.At the wheel was an older looking man.He took one look
at Ryoko and
looked at Tenchi like he was some kind of idiot.
Blade:Meet Whistler.Whiistler,meet...these guys.
Whistler:Hello.Was she bitten?
Tenchi:Yeah.
Whistler:Then kill her.
Washu:I will not let anyone kill my daughter.
Blade:It's better than what she'll become.
Kiyone:And just what does that mean?
Blade:I'll explain later.Whistler,let's go.
Whistler turned the ignition and sped away,to who knows where.

************************************************
Three hours later...
************************************************

Kiyone:What kind of bulls**t is this?
Sasami:There's no such thing as vampires.
Whistler:So you don't believe us,even after your encounter with Dylan?
Washu:There has to be a reasonable explanation for all this.
Whistler:You can think of something better?
Tenchi:A friend of ours was helping them.Why would she do that?
Blade:She's one of them.
Sasami:My sister could never be one of those...things!
Whistler:Oh,that's just the opposite.They could be anyone.For all we
know,there could be one of them in this very room.
Kiyone:Like who?
Blade:Like me.
Tenchi:What did you say?
Mihoshi:Did you say you're a vampire?
Blade:No...I'm something else.
Washu:What do you mean?
Whistler:Blade's mother was bitten by a vampire while she was pregnant.Blade
survived,but she didn't.Unfortunately,Blade
suffered genetic changes.He's able to withstand silver,garlic,even
sunlight.We paired up a while back to stop those things.
I have to make Blade a syrum in order to keep him from turning into a
vampire completly.A downside to his genetic changes;he inherited their
thirst.The syrum counteracts that.
Kiyone:So what kind of weapons do you guys use?
Whistler:Vampires are deadly allergic to silver,garlic and sunlight.So
anything made of,generates,shoots,contains,or is covered in one of those
three things is usefull.
Blade:We should kill that girl.
Tenchi:No!
Washu:Why do you want to kill her?
Whistler:She was bitten,right?Soon,she'll become one of them.
Mihoshi:Isn't there a cure?
Blade:There is no cure.
Washu:I'll find the cure.
Whistler:Good luck,considering you have two hours,at the most.
Washu:It'll do.
With that,Washu brought up her labtop.This startled Whistler and Blade.They
stared at Washu like...I don't know,use your imaginations!
Blade:Who are you people?
Tenchi:My name is Tenchi Masaki.This is Kiyone and Mihoshi,Galaxy Police
officers.That's Princess Sasami.That's Ryoko,
and that's Washu.
Whistler:All right.Nice to meet you.Now what the h**l is that?
Washu:This is my labtop.I can call on it anywhere to find anything I want.
Blade:Who are the Galaxy Police?
Kiyone:We are like normal police,but we enforce crime all over the universe.
Mihoshi:That's right!
Whistler:And your a princess?
Sasami:Yeah,but still call me Sasami.I'm from the planet Jurai.
Whistler:Planet what?You mean you're an alien?
Sasami:Yeah.
Blade:Aliens,space cops,see-through computers,vampires,what's this world
coming to?
Washu:I found it!
Washu held in her hand a small test tube,contaning a blue liquid.She pulled
out a injection gun and put the test tube into...wherever it's supposed to
go.She injected it into Ryoko's arm.
Tenchi:Will she be all right,Washu?
Washu:Yeah,she just needs time to regenrate the neck wound.
Blade:So,she can regenrate too?
Washu:I made her like that.
Whistler:You mean you created her?
Washu:Yep.She's like my daughter,because I used some of my cells to create
her,so I more like her mother than her creator.
Ryoko:Sure,"mom".
Sasami:Ryoko!You're okay!
Ryoko:What happened?Where am I?And who are you?
Tenchi:This may sound kind of wierd,Ryoko,but they will tell you what
happened.
Ryoko was quite while Blade and Whistler told her everything they had
discussed while she was asleep.When they finished,
Ryoko didn't look too happy.
Ryoko:So I almost became a vampire?
Blade:Yep.
BEEP!BEEP!BEEP!
Kiyone:What's that?
Whistler:It's the alarm.Someone's here!
Tenchi:Where?
Whistler:I don't know.
Mihoshi:There!
Dylan:Good evening.I'm here for Ryoko.
Tenchi:Over my dead body!
Dylan:Watch what you wish for,Tenchi.It just might come true...
With that,Dyaln displayed his fangs and rose his arms upward.What looked
like hundereds of vampires surrounded them.
Washu:Blade,help!
No answer.
Washu(turns around):Are going to...oh no...
Blade was gone.

To be continued...
