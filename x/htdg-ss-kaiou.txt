~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kaiouken, Elazul, and Minikata Moriya stand in front of a building at night.

Elazul: You're crazy. 
Kaiouken: Just follow the plan. 
{wide camera angle turn, Kaiouken holds up a detonater and presses it very Gundam Wing
like}
Kaiouken: 30 seconds. Go. {FF7 exciting music plays}

Kaiouken, Moriya and Elazul all run torward the building, but Moriya runs off on a 45
degree angle torwards the side of the building.

Elazul: Are you sure this will work?! 
Kaiouken: It has to.  

Our heroes begin the assault on the biological weapons facility.

Security gaurd: Stop! Let me see your AGH! 

{suddenly, a huge explosion blows off the front of the building}
Kaiouken and Elazul keep running, further inside. Eventually, they reach an inner
corridor.

Kaiouken: Alright, I'll go down and plant the...

{Suddenly 2 tentacle monsters burst from the wall}

Elazul: WHOA?! What are those?! 
Kaiouken: That's what this factories making...damn madmen..  

--------------  

Moriya:[holding up a guard, sword to his neck] Tell me, where is the girl?! 
Gaurd: I don't know! 
[Moriya slices his neck and runs on]

--------------  

{a tentacle monster collapses, Kaiouken and Elazul holding bloody swords are revealed
after it falls out of the camera's line of sight}
Kaiouken: I'll go down and plant the explosive. Watch for Moriya.  

--------------  

Moriya continues to run, now in an upper level.

A.C: Going somewhere, little man?! 
Moriya: Damn! Where is she?! 
A.C: I'm afraid I can't let you find her. We still need her for experiments. 
Moriya: Kassatsu Izayoi Gekka!! 

Moriya sheathes his sword. He draws it and slashes 16 times at light speed, and A.C
blocks every single one of them with his bare hands.

Moriya: What?! 
A.C: Die, foolish man.  

--------------  

Kaiouken stands up after planting the explosive, and looks a bit satisfied, but then a
tentacle monster busts through a wall.

Kaiouken: Damn! Not another one!  

--------------  

Moriya is kneeling, bleeding badly from several wounds.

A.C: Damn! I don't have enough time to finish you! 
A.C jumps into an elevator, and leaves.
Moriya:{having lost all the bloody marks since the camera looked away from him} Now's
	my chance!  

---------------  

Elazul: [fighting gaurds] Damn guys, hurry, I can't fight these gaurds forever! LAZER
	BLADE! 
[Elazul drops a Lazer Blade on 4 gaurds]

---------------  

Moriya is, once again, running down a corridor.

Moriya: Huh? That voice! 

Moriya looks in through one door's window and sees a screaming Nadia, who isn't wearing
very much, in one corner of an empty room with one of those one-sided mirrors, with a
tentacle monster in the other corner, which is slowly approaching her.

Moriya: DAMN! The door's locked! I need a key! 

Moriya runs around to look for the observation room.

----------------  

Another tentacle monster falls dead, and Kaiouken runs up the steps.

Kaiouken: I hope Moriya found her! 
Elazul: Hurry! Reinforcements are on the way! We don't have much time!  

----------------  

A.C: [boarding a helicopter on the roof] Bring the girl up here. We have no time.
RandomGuy: Yes sir!

----------------  

Moriya: GIVE ME THE KEY! 
Gaurd: Here! 

Moriya takes the key and runs back down the hall, and into the room on the other side of
the one way mirror. When he looks in through the mirror he sees the tentacle monster is
starting to wrap its tentacles around Nadia.

Moriya: No! How can I get through?! 

Moriya looks around, and sees a chair.

-------------  

Kaiouken and Elazul are running, slashing a bunch of gaurds.

Elazul: We can't go back out the front! 
Kaiouken: Where's Moriya?!  

-------------  

A.C: What?! He killed them?! I shouldn't have let that fool live! 

A.C climbs out of the helicopter, and walks back torward the elevator.

-------------  

Suddenly, a chair busts through the mirror.  Moriya leaps through and slashes the
tentacle monster to ribbons within seconds, and Nadia gets a really relieved face and
collapses.

Moriya: I'm here to help you! Take this! 

Moriya takes off his coat/cape thing and puts it on Nadia, then picks her up and runs
torward an elevator. He jumps in and pushes the button, and as the door is about to
close he sees A.C running down the hall.

A.C: YOU CAN'T GET AWAY! 
[the doors shut]
A.C: [pounding on the door] NO! DAMN!  

----------------  

Kaiouken: 1:50 seconds until the bomb goes off! 
Elazul: We're out of time! Start clearing a path, they'll have to catch up later! 

Suddenly, an elevator opens up beside them.

Moriya: [holding Nadia] Miss me? 
Nadia: [half concious] Unnnn.....aaaa... 
Kaiouken: Here! I'll carry her, you and Elazul clear a path out!  

-----------------  

A.C: [getting back on the helicopter] Take off! We're out of time!  

------------------------------------------------  

At the exact moment that Kaiouken, Moriya, and Elazul get a safe distance from the
building, it erupts in flames, and A.C's helicopter can be seeing flying off in the
distance.

Elazul: We almost had him.. 
Moriya: We'll get him... 

Kaiouken has nothing to say, he just looks down at Nadia, who is sleeping in his arms.

Elazul: Kaiou? 
Kaiouken: Thank you, Moriya..  

Elazul: We'll get you yet A.C...

{A.C, inside the helicopter}

A.C: Next time you will not excape alive...I know your name now...Moriya! 
Pilot: Where to next?
A.C: Back to HQ. They may have destroyed one facility and rescued girl#006-"Nadia" from
	there, but we have 5 more facilities with another 3 girls in 3 of them. We need
	to find 2 more female specimen to complete the larger plan...
Pilot: What is the larger plan?
A.C: Sore wa himitsu desu.

{Moriya, Elazul, and Kaiouken with Nadia}

Kaiouken, with Nadia in his arms, walks into the entrance of a hotel. They go into the
elevator and Elazul hits the button marked '5'. Kaiou looks down at Nadia and she's still
shocked from the earlier events, and tears streak her face* 
Kaiouken: [quietly] Hey...you're alright now...

The elevator stops, and the door opens.  The three walk over to another door.

Elazul: Hold on...I have the key somewhere...

He searches his pockets quickly, takes out a key, and unlocks the door.
Kaiouken enters the room, and gently lays Nadia down onto the bed in the hotel room and
softly strokes the side of her face.

Elazul: That was wild... 

Kaiou goes over and sits in one of the chairs at the table, facing Elazul and Moriya.

Kaiouken: Yeah...But I know they'll come to get her back. [looks over his shoulder at
	Nadia] But I won't let that happen.  

Elazul looks over to Moriya, who seems to be in deep thought.

Moriya: A.C... We still don't know his exact purpose for creating these monsters. 
Kaiouken: We'll find out, next time we confront him. 
Elazul: Whatever it is, it's not good. 
Moriya: We can't wait to long. He's bound to capture more girls to experiment on...

Kaiou gets up and walks over to the bed. Then he lies down on the bed beside Nadia,
holding her against him.

Nadia: ...Unn...the girls...We have to save the other girls... 
Kaiouken: We don't know where they are...
Nadia: I heard...some guards talking...they said that A.C had three other girls....He
	has them spread out in three other facilities...
Elazul: Since we destroyed one of them.. how many more are there? Just three?
Nadia: No...there's 5 more...
Moriya: Do you know where they are? 

Nadia shakes her head, weakly. 

Kaiouken: Just get some rest, Nadia. You need it. 
Nadia: ...Alright...

Kaiouken looks over at Elazul and Moriya.

Kaiouken: Looks like you guys are going to have to share a bed, there's only 2. 

Elazul and Moriya both give each other a mean look.

Elazul&Moriya:[sim] You're sleeping on the floor!

Outside of the hotel room, the sun starts to rise slowly, its light shining through the
curtains of the balcony warmly. Nadia awakens and sits up in bed. She rubs her eyes a
little, then she looks over at Kaiou, who is sleeping very soundly, and kisses him on
the forehead, gently.

Nadia(quietly): I love you...  

Nadia then pulls the robe she has on tighter about herself and steps onto the floor. She
walks toward the balcony, having to step over Elazul who's sleeping on the floor since
Moriya's on the bed...

Elazul: Unn...[rolls over on the pillow]

Nadia: Oops...  

Quickly but silently Nadia slips over to the balcony. She pushes the semi-transparent
curtains back and walks onto the cold balcony. She leans over the edge and watches the
sunrise. 

Nadia: It's so beautiful...I haven't see anything that beautiful in such a long time... 

Nadia thinks back to the two months she was locked up in A.C's facility. The dark images
of the day A.C and his men took her away from Kaiou flash through her mind...then the
growls of the tentacle monster and the thoughts of the experiments...

Nadia: It seems like...I've been seperated from Kaiou for years...

Nadia shudders a bit from the cold air. Then she sees a butterfly and she reaches her
hand out a little. It lands onto her hand. She looks at it in a sort of a dazed manner..

Nadia: You're so lucky...you don't have to worry about those sort of things...you can
	just fly away with those wings of yours...I wish I had wings, too.  

Kaiouken climbs out of bed and pulls a robe around himself, then goes out to the balcony
and gives Nadia a hug...

Nadia: Kaiou..
Kaiouken: You know I can't sleep without you..
Nadia: Then what have you been doing for the past 2 months?
Kaiouken: Laying in bed and crying...
Nadia: Oh Kaiou...
Kaiouken: Anyway, what's our next move? Do you know the locations of any of the plants?
	Another thing...I was thinking since you can fight too, I should bring you
	with...Because I don't feel safe leaving you behind...
Nadia: I'll be alright, just leave Elazul or Moriya to protect me.
Kaiouken: That's what makes me feel unsafe.
Nadia: Feel unsafe, huh? Well, in any case, my magic isn't too powerful now.
Kaiouken: Why not?
Nadia: You know that amethyst amulet I always wear?
Kaiouken: Yeah.
Nadia: That amulet isn't a normal amulet. It will amplify any magic spell when used
	correctly. It has a mystical power within it...a key to an ancient sorceror's
	temple. The problem is, that I don't have it. A.C took it. It's really precious
	to me too...

Nadia gets a sad look on her face at the thought of her pendant being lost. Kaiou hugs
her to try and comfort her. 

Kaiouken: It's alright.. We'll get it back.
Nadia: I hope so...
Kaiouken: It's a little cold out here. Let's go back inside.

Nadia and Kaiou both head back into the room. Elazul and Moriya are both sitting up in
bed... err.. Elazul's sitting on the floor.

Nadia: Hey, I'm hungry. Why don't one of you guys go downstairs and bring some food back 
	up here?  

Nadia starts to walk toward the bathroom. She stops in the doorway and looks back at the
three guys. 

Nadia: I'm taking a shower while somebody goes do that... there'd better not be any
	peeping toms around here. ;p  

Nadia eyes each of the three guys for a second, then she proceeds into the bathroom and
closes the door behind her, without locking it, leaving the three in the room to decide
who'll get the food. 

Kaiouken: Moriya, you go get food. It's obvious me and whoever's left are going to fight
over peeping at her. I don't want to tangle with the likes of you.
Moriya: HAI! YES KAIOU-SAMA!

Moriya runs off, pretending to be disciplined.

Kaiouken: Damn him and his jokes...Okay Elazul, let's go!

Kaiouken draws his sword.

Elazul cowers in the corner.

Elazul: Don't hurt me! 

Kaiouken sheathes his sword.

Kaiouken: Heheh. 

Kaiouken walks into the bathroom, takes off his clothes and climbs into the shower with
Nadia.

Kaiouken: I'm dirty too. I don't feel like waiting.
Nadia:[gets a mean smile] Hey! Just because I love you doesn't mean you get special
	privilages!
Kaiouken: Sure it does. Now hand me the conditioner.
Nadia: NO! IT'S MINE! [Nadia squeezes the whole bottle onto her head]
Kaiouken: Ugh...Now what do I do? 

Kaiouken rubs his head against Nadia's hoping to absorb some of the conditioner.

Nadia: Hey, stop it! My conditioner! MINE!
Kaiouken: Not for long! I'll steal as much as I can!

Nadia quickly rinses the conditioner out of her hair, Kaiouken panics and kneels
underneath it hoping to get the drops of it that fall.

Nadia: Hmph! Silly Kaiou!

Nadia steps out of the shower to dry herself off, Kaiou stays in to finish showering.
Nadia walks out of the bathroom with her towel on, loosely, in a half-way decent manner
with a blue towel on her head. She sits down at the table in the room across from Elazul.

Nadia: And I guess Moriya went for the food?
Elazul: Yep.

Just then, Moriya comes back in through the door with a bag which is giving off
wonderful aromas.

Moriya: I'm back.
Elazul: Yes! I was getting hungry waiting here.

Nadia gets up from her seat and jumps at Moriya which causes him to lose his balance and
fall over since he wasn't anywhere near ready for that.

Moriya: Ah!

Kaiouken walks out of the bathroom with a robe on and has a towel draped across his
shoulders. Then he looks over and sees that Nadia has jumped Moriya.

Kaiouken: Err...
Moriya: I didn't do anything!!
Elazul: ... ^^;
Kaiouken: Don't even start that with me, Moriya!

Nadia stands up after taking the bag from Moriya and hyperly hops over to the table
dumping the contents onto the it. Her eyes sparkle she gets a really big smile on her
face.

Nadia: Donuts.. biscuits.. bottles of milk and juice... bread... yogurt... WAAI!
	FOOD! *_*  

Kaiouken, Elazul, and Moriya all look at her like, 'Ehhh...' while Nadia doesn't even
wait for them and starts chugging down a bottle of milk and stuffing her face with the
hot biscuits. 

Nadia: Mmmm... this is so good! I haven't had a really decent meal in forever!
Kaiouken: Hehehe...

And so the three guys walk over to the table to join Nadia in having breakfast.

--About 30 minutes later-- 

Nadia: Aaaaahh! That was so delicious!
Moriya: You seemed to enjoy it a lot.

Nadia leans back to stretch, then she thinks of something.

Nadia: Heeey! I know what we need to do next!
Elazul: And what's that?
Moriya: You have a plan?
Nadia: Yeah... You guys need to take me shopping! I need clothes!

All three guys fall out of their chairs, expecting something...different to be said.

Nadia: Well? Take me or not?
Kaiouken: Er...but we have a slight problem. We don't have any woman's clothes here.
	One of us is going to run to the store to buy Nadia some clothes.  

Everybody looks at Elazul.

Elazul: DON'T LOOK AT MEeeE! 
Nadia: Here you go Elazul! Here'r my sizes! [hands Elazul a piece of paper]
Elazul: Ugh...

*5 minutes later*

Kaiouken: Nadia, what did they feed you in that place? You seemed famished.
Nadia: You don't wanna know. It was horrible.
Moriya: I imagine she had to live off of...[whisper's in Kaiouken's ear]

Kaiouken thinks.

Kaiouken: Poor Nadia! You had to live off THAT?!
Nadia: Yeah. >.<
Everybody: ...
Moriya: Well, in any case, you are safe now.
Nadia: Yeah. Thanks to Kaiou!
Moriya:[muttering under his breath Er...I was the one that saved you...don't you remember
	 anything?!
Kaiouken: You owe Moriya most of the credit.
Nadia: Ooooo. So Moriya's the brave guy that saved me.
Moriya: Uh...yeah...
Moriya: [thinking] After what happened to Trunks I should be careful that she doesn't
	pay too much attention to me... 
Nadia pounces Moriya and hugs him, still only wearing the towels.

Nadia: THANKS MORIYA!
Moriya: AIEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!

--Elazul is seen walking down the sidewalk towards the store.--

Elazul:[mumbling] Ugh.. why is it always me...First I have to sleep on the floor, then
Kaiou threatens me, and now I have to go by girl clothes! [yelling now] WHY ME?!

A few people stop to stare at Elazul. 

Elazul: Err.. eheh... [walks on silently for a few more minutes] Hmm...here's a good
	looking shop.  

Elazul walks in through the glass doors. And looks at the list Nadia gave him with her
measurements and the kind of clothes she wants. 

--Back at the hotel room-- 

Nadia's still in Moriya's lap making him all panicky and Kaiou's looking a little
annoyed. 

Moriya: Uh.. you can let go of me now Nadia...
Nadia: Huh? Oh! [hops back into her chair] Hm... I hope Elazul doesn't get me anything
pink... and I hope he doesn't get me any uncomfortable...

--Scene cuts back to Elazul in the big store--

Elazul: [eyes get really big] ...Undergarments?!

People stop shopping to stare at Elazul, who slips up onto the escalator all embarrassed.

Elazul: I can't believe they're making me do this...[annoyed sigh]

The escalator leads Elazul to the 2nd floor filled with women's clothes. A big section
of it is filled with women's outer wear, and another section's filled with bras and
underwear.

Elazul: Great... where should I start?

Elazul is walking around, holding a bag full of women's clothes, getting weird looks.

Elazul: Moriya, next time, it's gonna be you...Why can't it just be Kaiou?! He's her
	boyfriend! He knows what she likes best!

--back at the hotel--

Nadia: Hmm, I'm hungry.
Kaiouken: Again?!
Nadia: You try eating nothing but THAT for 2 months! Maybe next time A.C comes I'll have
	him capture YOU!
Kaiouken: ...
Nadia: Somebody go get food.
Moriya: I went last time.
Kaiouken: I don't trust the two of you alone.
Nadia: -.-

Suddenly, Elazul walks in the door.

Nadia: Ellie! You're back! 
Elazul:[to self] Ellie? 

Nadia jumps up and snatches the clothes out of his hands, runs to the bathroom to put
them on, then stops and looks at Kaiou.

Nadia: No peaking you! I mean it! 

Nadia goes in and closes the door.

Moriya: Does that mean I can peak?

Kaiouken puts his hand on his sword.

Moriya: I guess not.

--About 15 or 20 minutes pass--

Moriya: Man, how much clothes did you get her?
Elazul: Well... 

Suddenly the bathroom door opens and Nadia steps out. She's wearing a white long-sleeved
shirt with "Goddess" printed in gold and silver lettering across the chest and a silvery
mini-skirt with a grayish belt holding it up. She twirls around to show off her outfit.

Nadia: So? How do I look?
All three: It looks great!
Nadia: Hehe...thanks. Ellie did a good job shopping for me. I should take him shopping
	with me more often!
Elazul: Err...Right...
Kaiouken: Psst...Hey, how'd you know she wanted a shirt like that?
Elazul: She wrote 'Get me a shirt that says 'Goddess' on it or don't DARE show you're
	face back at the hotel'...
Kaiouken & Moriya: Oh... ^^;

Nadia walks over to the three guys all excited like and stuff. 

Nadia: Hey, hey! Let's go somewhere fun! I haven't been doing anything worthwhile for
	two months. Pleeeeease?

Nadia: Come on! Let's go somewhere fun! 
{after spacing out for a month}

Kaiouken: Uh...right! I know where to go!
Naida: Sure took you long enough..-.-
Kaiouken: Come on! I want to show you something!

Kaiouken, Nadia, Moriya, and Elazul leave.

{walking down a street}

Nadia: So where are we going Kaiou?
Kaiouken: Somewhere fun.
Nadia: Where?
Kaiouken: It's a secret.
Elazul: I don't see what's so secret about

Moriya cuts Elazul.

Moriya: Quiet! She's been...absent for 2 months! She doesn't know about it! You'll
	spoil the surprise!
Nadia: Huh?

Nadia grabs Elazul and starts shaking him vigorously.

Nadia: Tell me ELLIE! TELL ME!!!!!
Elazul: N-no!

They reach a large garage.

Moriya: Isn't this where the original Here's the Deal took place?
Kaiouken: ...No. Not at all. You must be mistaken. Come on, in here.

They all go in, to see Umpa lumpas and Cosby battling with everybody.
Kaiouken: Er....wrong garage.

They leave and walk further down the street.

Nadia: Wah! Somebody tell me where we're going!
Moriya: ...
Elazul: ...
Nadia: Kaiou! Tell me or I'll cry!
Kaiouken: Er....no.

Nadia wails, and eventually they reach a large hangar-garage type thing with a
ladder on the side.

Kaiouken: Up here.

Nadia starts climbing up the ladder, then Moriya touches Kaiouken on the shoulder
as he's about to grab the ladder, that startles Kaiouken, and he leaps up. One
hand grabs the ladder, and the other hand grabs...

Kaiouken: Hey, soft...
Nadia: What the?!

{scene cuts to the top of the ladder, on top of the garage-hangar}

Kaiouken: Hey! It's not like I meant to do it!
Elazul: Can we please continue?
Kaiouken: Right.

Kaiouken opens a hatch on top of the garage and they all climb in, it's very dark
inside, and they all climb down and start walking across a catwalk.

Kaiouken: Nadia..you like roller coasters, right?
Nadia: Er...yeah.

They reach the center, and still can't see anything.

Kaiouken: Then get ready for your fastest ride ever. Let me introduce to you....the
	EARLY-90's-COOL TALLGEESE!

Kaiouken flips on the lights, and a gigantic Tallgeese is standing in front of them
...and it's hot neon pink.

Nadia: Huh? Er....yeah...

Kaiouken opens the hatch, and unlike Tallgeese, it has a spacious interior, including
2 seats, another room which has a fridge and a PSX, and a surround sound stereo system.

Nadia: Wow!

Nadia and Kaiou climb into the seats.
Moriya: What about us?
Kaiouken: Sorry guys, only room for two. You'll just have to use my old gears.
Elazul: Damn!

The pink Tallgeese blasts out of the hangar(without the use of a door) and Nadia squeals
at the incredible speed.
Kaiouken: What was it you said you needed to cast your spells back on page 1? Some sort
of amulet? Let's go get it!
Nadia: [high pitched squealing]

The Tallgeese-pink blasts off into the distance......


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yeah!  The Kaiou/Nadia side story is pretty much done!  Go back and read the main stuff
now!
