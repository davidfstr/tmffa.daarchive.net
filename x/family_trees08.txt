Family Trees - Chapter 8
A Current Moved


Warning and Disclaimer before: any guess as to when
the characters are going to find a way into the real
world to rip me to pieces...


Last Episode: The roving disaster areas collided,
Nabiki gave Ukyou and Leaf some private space to talk,
she then decides to blackmail Kiyone a little. Fam
and Ihrie tell Ryoko about her father. And virtually
everybody else is about to hit the Shrine.

-------------------------------------------------------

"This is driving me CRAZY!!" Akane shouted. Then
she turned back to look between Ihrie and Ayeka. 
"Every since I got here I've had this feeling I should
know you and that green haired lady back there, and
now YOU show up."
"Well, she does sort of act like Kodachi,"
Ranma-chan noted.
"Like that...that..arrogant...lunatic?" Ayeka
sputtered in rage.
"Certainly seems to fit you, Sis," Ryoko smirked.
"You be quiet!"
"We REALLY shouldn't have said anything, Ihrie,"
Fam noted. ~Wow, for once I'M the responsible one.~
"I know, I know," Ihrie practically growled.
"Even if that's how SHE'S familiar, how about
Makibi-san, or her? I mean until now I only got this
feeling from Nabiki!"
"Don't ask me," Ihrie said. "Last time I felt
anything like it was with an old love interest."
"That Ashram person right?" Ryoko froze letting
people pass her for a moment.
"Is something wrong, Ryoko?" Tenchi asked.
"Yeah, Oneechan," Sasami noted. "You just turned
white as a sheet."
"Sasami! She is NOT our sister!!"
"Umm...that cat-girl," now Ranma stopped and took a
good look at Fam, before taking off at a run down the
hill. Ryouga laughed nervously as Akane glared at
him. "Heh, imagine that, and I thought he'd already
noticed."
"I'm sure," Akane left to chase after Ranma. "Get
back here you baka!! She's NOT a cat!" Everybody
looked at Ryouga for a moment.
"Ranma's afraid of cats," he snickered viciously.
"Ohhhhh kay," and they turned back to staring at
Ryoko.
"Do you know Ashram, Ryo-chan?" Fam asked.
"Tall, serious, dark-hair?"
"Yeah," Ihrie said, nervously. "Why?"
"Do you know where he is now."
"Well, he just sort of left one day, don't know
where to. He took the news that my father was some
kind of demon pretty hard," Ryoko took a look at her
hair for a moment.
*******************************************************
One his way to the shrine, Xellos suddenly felt
VERY nervous.
*******************************************************
"I don't have that much money," Kiyone protested.
"Oh, please I just wanted to see you squirm,"
Nabiki snickered. "Still a little information here
and there would be useful."
"Like what?"
"Like the name of anybody that's every crossed
paths with Genma Saotome, or at least any recorded
encounter."
"Deal," Kiyone agreed, with the Yagami's computers
that would be easy to find. She imagined her mother's
reaction to finding out that her daughter had
inherited "Dad's" roaming eye.
"Ugh, what hit me?" Nabiki and Kiyone turned to
Jiro Kuonji pulling himself up from his enforced nap.
"According to reports you pissed off the walking
earthquake and then took a swan dive into Kiyone
here," Nabiki said simply.
"Uhh," he tried to consider this. "Did you see a
brown haired girl with pointy ears..."
"Your wife and daughter are in a dimensional pocket
discussing matters," Kiyone explained hostilely, after
all this guy had missed Mihoshi and bowled into her. 
~Not bad looking for an older guy though, hmmm.~
"Oh that guy is awake!!!" Mihoshi yelled loudly. 
She bounced over and stuck her face into Jiro's. 
"Hey, do you know what the name of the guy that thew
you was?"
"Uh...Ryouga.." he said.
"YATTA!!" Mihoshi yelled happily, jumping up down
happily. "Hey Kiyone!! You can meet my brother!! Ooo
I wonder if A-Ko is here too!!" Kiyone sweatdropped.
~Mihoshi's family??~ Kiyone wondered what she had
down in her previous life to deserve this.
"Ah HA!!" Nabiki turned to the diminuitive pink
haired scientist that had seemingly appeared out of
nowhere. "I found that anomaly." A surprised
half-elf, quarter-elf fell out of thin air as Washu
typed on her console.
"Hey! They paid me for that!" Nabiki said as the
elf-bloods disappeared again.
"That pocket is messing up my calculations!" 
Mother and daughter popped into existence.
"People expect to get what they pay for!" Leaf and
Ukyou popped out again.
"You compare money to scientific discovery?!?"
"I made a deal, and I'm HOLDING that deal!" 
Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Jiro watched as Ukyou and Leaf
kept appearing and disappearing with hardly a time to
get a word in.
"QUIT IT!!!" Leaf and Ukyou shouted at once over
several pops.
"You two are pathetic." Most people didn't notice
the phrase, but Kiyone and Nabiki, feeling a now VERY
familiar sensation, both turned in the direction and
groaned. Nabiki's distraction resulted in a fuming
pair of girls about reading to tear into Washu and
Nabiki.
*******************************************************
Xellos suddenly felt irrationally paranoid, almost
as if some cosmic force were out to get him.
*******************************************************
"Umm, Ihrie, you didn't sleep with him or anything
did you?" Tenchi 
"Ryoko that's a rather rude question."
"Oh please Lord Tenchi, as if she knows ANYTHING
about social graces."
"What's going on?" Ryouga scratched his head, but
decided not to go off anywhere since he'd probably
just get lost.
"NO, I did not sleep with him, not that it is any
of your business," Ihrie said.
"Your father wouldn't happen to be Xellos
Metallium," Ryoko asked, ignoring the looks she was
getting. "Would he." Ihrie suddenly felt a little
scared.
"Yes," Ihrie said nervously. "Why?"
"Metallium-sama?" Ayeka blinked. "He was a friend
of my mother's." Ihrie and Ryoko took a moment to
look at Ayeka, and then nodded.
"Suddenly the hair makes sense," Ryoko mumbled. 
Then she blushed and turned back to Ihrie. "Well
isn't it funny what travelling over time and
dimensions can cause."
"No its not," Tenchi put in, remembering his own
experiences with alternate universes.
"What is it Ryoko," Ihrie asked angrily.
"You shouldn't be mean to Ryo-chan, Ihrie!" Fam
retorted innocently.
"Well, you see, Ashram is my son," Ryoko started,
pointing her fingers together.
"IHRIE!!" Fam's voice reached painful tones. "That
was my GRANDSON you were flirting with?"
"Ah HA!!" Ayeka pointed. "You see what kind of
woman she is Tenchi, she's just not fit for you! 
There is NO way this demon woman is blood of Jurai."
"Ayeka," Tenchi said wearily. "Not right now."
"Ah Akane, I was almost back to house anyway!"
Ranma-chan's voice whined.
"You are going to stay here and be polite to your
cousin's girlfriend's mother!" The surprising thing
was that Akane didn't find that an awkward statement. 
"Ranma no Baka!!"
"But she's a c-c-c-c-c..."
*THWACK*
"Oww!"
"I'm sorry, did we miss anything?" Akane asked
sweetly as the Tenchi crew, Fam and Ihrie all blinked
at her.
"The scarred girl was dating the silver-haired
girl's son."
"Oh, so?"
"It gets worse," Ryoko said, nervously. Everybody
looked at her. "Ashram's father is Xellos Metallium."
Ihrie turned green and really silent for a moment.
*******************************************************
"MY FATHER IS A DEAD DEMON!!!!!!!!"
Xellos was not certain he had actually heard that,
but it made him nervous anyway.
*******************************************************
"Anybody you know?" Nabiki asked, as everybody
turned to the shout. They had been talking to the
three exorcists about one Kodachi Kuno when the shout
rang out.
"Nope, that's a new voice," Kiyone said. "I wonder
what the purple-haired breeding program left behind
this time." 
The green-haired woman had her shoulder grabbed and
she was twisted about to look at a snap shot. The
angry twin was holding it and looking down with barely
restrained anger. Kiyone sweatdropped while Nabiki
shrugged.
"Oh, we recognized what you two were when hit the
top of the stairs," Nabiki said.
"I'm Yohko's sister AND I'm half demon," Iako
muttered. Then she did something she had never, in
her life of martial and supernatural discipline, ever
done. She fainted. Ayaka Kisaragi snatched the
picture as it drifted down and looked at it again.
"You know I thought he looked familiar," she said. 
"My parents know him and his oath-bound, well wife I
guess."
"Hey, he's one of the top people on my ex's home
dimension!" Washu declared looking at the pic.
"I think its time to have a little family
discussion," Kiyone said to Nabiki.
"Unfortunately so," the younger girl sighed. "I
was hoping not to let Akane find out about this."
*******************************************************
"So if you felt this familiar tug towards your
half-brother," Ranma's mouth was working him towards a
grave. "Why'd all three of you feel it towards each
other?" He looked around and realized he had just
said something stupid.
Akane, Ayeka and Ihrie regarded each other
curiously. Ihrie had it pretty much figured out by
now, but the other two took a little longer.
"This has to be some cruel joke," Ayeka said.
"Well I can think of someone who can probably
answer some questions."
"Oh?" Ihrie asked.
"I as well," Ayeka noted. "Since I am thinking of
someone else that I've felt that same 'tug' as you
call it with before."
"NABIKI!!!""KIYONE!!!" And they as a crowd rushed
towards the shrine.
