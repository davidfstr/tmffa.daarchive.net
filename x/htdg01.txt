~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Narrator: We find X working hard in his fourty acre carrot field. He is sweating
	profusely, and appears to be about to collapse. Just then, Alanna walks up.  

Alanna: Hey X, want some help? 
X: No! I must-huff huff-get...chick-huff-magnet-huff huff-ism. 
Alanna: Hey, you don't look so good. You should take a break. 
X: Magnetism......  

Narrator: Just then Kagato walks up. He watches X for a minute, and then turns to Alanna.

Kagato: Is he still at it? 
Alanna: Oh, hey Kagato. Yeah, he's still working. 
Kagato: Man, it must be over ninety degrees today. I think we should get him inside. 
Alanna: I dunno, he seems pretty intent on getting Tenchi's chick-magnetism.  

Narrator: Kagato strikes a pose not unlike Vash the Stampede when he wants to look cool.

Kagato: Well then, this calls for drastic action! 
Alanna: What do you plan on doing? 
Kagato: This!  

Narrator: Kagato leaps into the air and tackles X. The two of them begin to wrestle on
	the ground, and X's screams can be heard all around.

X: NO!!!! I MUST GET THE CHICK-MAGNETISM!!!! 
Kagato: Shut up! You're going inside right now! You'll pass out from the heat if you
	don't get back inside!
X: ARGH!!! ALANNA, HELP!!!! 
Alanna: Uh, no thanks. I'm fine right here. 
X: AHHHHH!!!!  

Narrator: Kagato eventually subdues X, and they all go back inside.  

X, Kagato, and Alanna walk into the house. Tenchi and Bent are talking---

Bent: Don't you think that Sasami is hot!! You don't need her, you got the other two...
	older women.
Tenchi: Yes well..., (notices that Kagato and company have entered) I don't see how that
	has anything to do with Gekiganger 3...
Bent: ???? (notices that kagato has walked in....) Oh, Right... Gekiganger... [Winks] I
	understand. 

[Kagato realizes what Bent was talking to Tenchi about and hangs his head]

Kagato: Dammit Bent, get Sasami out of your mind. [Kagato grabs Bent and 'Ham throws' him
outside into the carrot patch] And don't came back until you understand the meaning of
pleasingly proportioned.  
Alanna: Hey, is X okay? 
Kagato: I'm sure he'll be fine if he just lies down for a while. 
Tenchi: So uh, how long are all of you going to be staying here? 
Kagato: Uh, I dunno. Alanna? 
Alanna: Huh? I really don't know. I think X is the one that talked to Nobuyuki about us
	staying here. 
Sasami: Well, you guys are more than welcome to stay here as long as you want. 
Kagato&Alanna: Thank you, Sasami.

Later on that day...

X: Argh, what happened? 
Alanna: Well, you were working in the carrot patch, and then Kagato knocked you out and
	brought you back into the house. 
Kagato: And then I tossed Bent out into the field and told him not to come back until he
	understands the concept of 'pleasingly proportioned.'
X: Ahhh. Well, that's nice. 
Tenchi: Say X, what did my dad say to you about staying here?
X: Uh, well, I think it was something like, 'Now, X, you and your friends can stay here
	for as long as you want. It's nice to have so many new faces staying here.  And
	so many pretty girls, too.'
Tenchi: Ugh.
Ryoko: Say, Tenchi, do you want to go take a bath later? I'll wash your back for you.
Ayeke: You most cerntainly will not! Lord Tenchi is not going to take a bath with a
	monster like you!
Tenchi: Uh, I have to go do some work in the fields. I'll be back later.

Tenchi hauls ass out of the house and runs toward the carrot fields.

Ayeka: My, how quickly he runs.
Alanna: So, what are we going to do while we are here?
Kagato: Uh, I dunno. Let's just relax and enjoy ourselves.
Sasami: Lunch is ready!
ALL: Yay!

~	~	~	~	~

Bent, who is rather worn looking, is one his why back to the house---  
Bent:[to self] The blue hair.... the puppy dog eyes....and she can cook...

-time passes-

Bent:[to self] Man I didn't know the house was this far away...

Suddenly, Tenchi runs by, but he doesn't pause.

Bent:[to self] I wonder what was wrong with him?...Hey, I can see the lights to the
house.

-- 

Bent reaches the door and knocks.  Sasami answers the door.

Sasami: Hello, you must be Mr. Bent, Kagato told me not to let you in until you
	understand the concept of pleasingly proportioned.
Bent: Umm. 
Sasami: Well? 
Bent: Umm, well...It's like...

Ryoko walks up to the door.

Sasami: Ryoko... 
Ryoko: You, Kagato's friend? 
Bent: Yeah... 
Ryoko: Hmm... [Ryoko brings out a Hentai picture featuring her and Morrigan] Look at
	this picture.
Bent: [Bent looks] It's nice, drawn quite well. 
Ryoko: Nice!!! Just Nice!! What about the big... [Ryoko points back in the direction 
	of the carrot patch]
Bent:[hangs head] Man...  

Narrator: They all finish eating lunch, and then try to figure out what they should do.  

Kagato: Anybody want to play some Naked Twister?  

Narrator: Everyone gives Kagato an evil look.  

Kagato: Um, nevermind. 
X: We have to work on some kind of plan. 
Morrigan: Yes, we can't stay here forever. We must plan our attack. 
Alanna: Well, you guys do that. I'm gonna go talk to Washu. 
Kagato: Okay, see you later then. So, does anybody have any good ideas?  

--Bent, walking in X's carrot patch-- 

Bent: Stupid Kagato...Making me stay out here... 

-just then Bent is attacked- 

Bent: What the hell was that? {a pile of orange mush lands at Bent's feet}[Bent looks
	around] Pumpkin monsters?  
?????: No, Carrots (monster...carrot for head)
Bent: Who the hell are you? 
?????: I am Deneb. Hey you’re not to bad looking, but sadly ours must remain a forbidden
	love... 
Bent: Umm.. 
Deneb: Attack.

A battle ensues.

-Carrot 50HP -Carrot 50HP 
Bent 100HP -Deneb 100HP  
-Carrot 50HP -Carrot 50HP  

A carrot removes its carrot head and hurls it at Bent.

Bent: Aggggghhhh.... What kind of of attack was that (Bent HP reduced to 50) 
Deneb: Ha ha that's the beauty of it... 

The Carrots attack repeatedly.

Bent: AGGGGGGhhhh!!!! HP50-HP25-Hp13-HP7_HP5 Aggggghhhh!!! 
Deneb: Stop the attack. 
Bent: (panting) And just when I was going to say you were attractive.. 
Deneb: Finish him. 
Bent: I'm finished...unless..[Bent pulls out a tarot card with a carrot on it and throws
	it up into the air]
Ryo-oki: Meow!! Meow!!! 

Ryo-oki consumes the carrot monsters.

Deneb: What!? 
Bent: It worked, now's my chance. IAINUKI!!!! (an attack so powerful it damages the
	warrior himself)  
Deneb: EEHhhhh (HP reduced to zero falls to the ground) 
Bent: Shit..forgot about the backlash... [Bent collapses do to backlash from the Iainuki
	attack]

---Several hours later---

Bent: Ugh...My head? [Looks around and sees Ryo-oki feasting on X's carrots] Oh no... X
	is going to be pissed. 
Deneb: Ugh, my head...I'm really sorry, please forgive me...
Bent: Um.. Sure. (Bent's Reputation drops) 
Debeb: Really!!! I'm so happy... 

---Bent heads toward home, with a seeming pleasingly proportioned female--

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X: Well, you guys work on a plan. I'm gonna go back out to the carrot patch. I just know
	that I can get Tenchi's chick-magnetism if I keep working.
Kagato: Okay, have fun.

Narrator: Kagato begins to discuss tactics and strategy with Shu, Gort, and Zechs.
Sasami serves them some tea and then goes to play with Ruri. As X walks out the door,
Bent comes in with a very attractive witch.

X: Hey Bent.
Bent: X, is this girl pleasingly proportioned?
X: Yes. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go back out to the fields. [to himself] Damn,
Bent went out to the field and got some chick-magnetism. I must hurry. 
Kagato: Well Bent, it appears that you have finally found the meaning of pleasingly
	proportioned. Good job. 
Bent: Thanks Kagato. This is Deneb.
Gort: You do realize that our reputation has dropped greatly because you chose to forgive
	her, don't you?
Bent: Uh...yes?
Zechs: Argh. This is going to make it that much harder to recruit the Sky Knights. 
Kagato: Hey, don't worry. We can just liberate lots of cities and build our reputation
	back up. 
Shu: Well, we must act quickly then. We need to move our forces to the island of Avalon. 
Kagato: Right! Let's ready the troops. 
Gort: Unfortunately, our troops are not ready for combat at this time. We need at least
	a week to prepare.
Kagato: Damn it. Well, I guess we'll be staying here for a while.

Narrator: Suddenly, X bursts in, looking very distraught.

X: Where did all my carrots go?
Bent: Um, well, Deneb was using them in her experiments, and then Ryo-ohki came and ate
	them all. 
X: What??? Why does God mock me???

Narrator: X falls to the floor crying, and the others stare at him in silence.

Kagato: So, uh, anyone for a beer?

Alanna: I could use a drink.  Got anything other than beer? That stuff always tastes like
	piss to me. Preferably something...stronger.

Bent: Avalon....That will be a tough battle...Kagato, how many princess do we have?
Kagato: None...
Bent: Dammit, Then I'm off to find some Royal Crowns...Deneb, you're coming with me.
Deneb: So manly...
Kagato: ...Hmmm...you have only a week.
Bent: I know, start training the amazons. It shouldn't take me long.

---Bent leaves---
-After many random battles, Bent has still not found a crown.-

Bent: Damn, all I got was a 'trade ticket.'
Deneb: Oh, poor Honey...

---Bent and Deneb arrive in the city of Chilfa located on the sky island Muspelm---

Priest: In exchane for the zodiac stones I will give you a Royal Crown.
Bent: Oh, umm... you have a Royal Crown..?
Priest: Yes, quite a few to be exact...

Bent nods to Deneb.

Deneb: STUN!!! 

Bent walks into the temple and 'borrows' the Royal Crowns.

Bent: Ok Deneb, we can go now.
Deneb: Yes, dear.

---Bent returns to Tenchi's---

Kagato: Well?
Bent: Here, this should do [dumps 99 Royal crowns out of his pocket] and here is a
	trade ticket too. [hands Kagato the trade ticket]
Kagato: 99!?!? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Zenobia is ours..

Scene: The desert.

Neosaim is walking in a desert, hungry and with his clothes ripped apart....

NEOSAIM: Oh..... I wish I had something to eat.... It's been 3 days that I have been
	wandering in this desert, for no aparent reason.....  

Suddenly, Neosaim feels a vibration from the bottom of his heart.

NEOSAIM: This feeling...... Again, the world needs my assistance!!! My strenghth!!! My
	ability to change into a cheerleader!! OK! I must get contact with the other
	guys!!  

Neosaim concentrates to do a telepathic connection with Kagato, but he forgot that he
failed Telepathy in 5th grade.

NEOSAIM: Uhmn...Nothing happened...I will just throw a messenger fish to tell Kagato
	he can use my help!
  
Neosaim throws the fish, hoping that it will get to its destination...What will happen
next??

--Later that night, up at the Shrine...--

Alanna: Hey, Yosho. Been a long time.
Katsuhito:[light glares off his glasses] Do I...know you?
Alanna: Yep. It'd be...480 years ago, now. A small hamlet in Britain.
Katsuhito:[expressionless] Tea?
Alanna: Yes, thank you.
Katsuhito: Four hundred and eighty years ago...hmm. It's rather flattering that you
	think I'm that well preserved.  
Alanna: Yosho...[Alanna reaches out and grabs the tea, which is at least five feet from
	her] Remember now?
Katsuhito: It's coming back to me. Are you still....uh....
Alanna: Crazy? Not...quite. I've got her under control. I've...exorcised...my daemons.
Katsuhito: ...It's nice to see you again, Alanna.
Alanna: Same here. Say, did you ever finish your 'world tour'?
Katsuhito: Almost. Still haven't gotten around to the Americas yet.
Alanna: Maybe you'll make it someday.
Katsuhito: Where's Aeka and Ryoko? Last I saw, you three were having a drinking contest.
Alanna: Well, when I left them, they were sleeping peacefully under the table. Nice
	girls, but no head for alcohol.
Katsuhito: ...

--Back at the house...-- 

X: Hey, what happened to Ayeka and Ryoko? 
Kagato: Alanna drank both of them under the table. 
X: Oh. I'm going outside. 
Kagato: Okay, see you later then. [turns to Bent] And so I says to Shu, I says....  

--Outside the house--

X: Oh man. Things are kinda boring around here. Without my carrot field, I really don't
	have much to do. Say, what's that?

Suddenly, a fish smacks X right in the face, and X falls over with a loud crash.

X: That....hurt...
Kagato: Hey X, you okay? Hm...a fish. A naked fish. Must be an important message from
	Neo. [reads the message] Hm....We must act quickly. X, go get Yosho. I'm gonna
	wake the others.
X: Uh....okay.

--One hour later--

X: Man, I swear that these steps get longer each time I have to climb them.

Narrator: Suddenly, there is a bright flash of light and a girl appears on the steps
	behind X.  

Girl: Hi Daddy!!!
X: Huh?
Girl: You don't remember me Daddy? It's me, Mayuka!
X: Sorry, you got the wrong guy.
Mayuka: Really? Well, can you take me to my Daddy?
X: Yeah, but first I have to finish climbing these long ass steps.
Mayuka: I'll come with you!
X: Great.

--Meanwhile, in the Dimension of Darkness...--

Yuzuha: Damnit! It was the wrong guy! Oh well. Mayuka will soon be able to get to Tenchi,
	and then I can finally have my revenge! In the meantime, I think I'll watch some
	TV. I wonder what's on the Cartoon Network. [flips to the Cartoon Network] Shin
	Tenchi! Oh God no!!! Maybe I don't need to do anything to Tenchi. This show is
	punishment enough.

--At the top of the stairs--

X: *huff, huff* Man these steps are long.
Mayuka: Are we going to see my daddy?
X: [muttered] Damn kid...[normal] No, honey. Maybe in a little bit.
X and Mayuka enter the shrine.
X: Hey, we have to talk. I just got a message from Neo-
Alanna: Who is that?
X: Oh, this is Mayuka.
Mayuka: [to Yosho] Are you my daddy?
Yosho: No, dear, I'm not.
Alanna: What's the message, X?

X: Well actually, I don't know what it is. A naked fish hit me in the face, and then
	Kagato looked at it for a while and said that Neo needed our help. He told me to
	come up here and get you guys. That's when I ran into Mayuka.
Mayuka: Can we please go see my Daddy now? 
X: Okay. Well, see you guys back at the house. Come on Mayuka. 
Mayuka: Yay! I get to see my Daddy!  

--After X and Mayuka leave...--

Alanna: That girl is Tenchi's daughter?
Yosho: Yes. It would appear that Yuzuha is planning on getting revenge on Tenchi.
Alanna: You always know everything that is going to happen don't you?
Yosho: Yes I do. Would you like to help me put together a bet for the Superbowl?
Alanna: Well, not really.
Yosho: Okay, nevermind. Now, you must promise not to say anything to the others about
	this.
Alanna: What? About Yuzuha?
Yosho: No, about my bet. If they found out they would be all over me for my money.

Alanna face-faults.

--Meanwhile, in the Dimension of Darkness...--

Stuffed Animal 2: Yuzuha, are we going to continue with our plans?
Yuzuha: ....Shin Tenchi....bad....
Stuffed Animal 17: Yuzuha, are you alright?

--Back at the Masaki house...--

Ryoko: Tenchi, that girl is trouble! I can tell!
Mayuka: Daddy help!
Tenchi: Ryoko stop it!
Kagato: You know, it's stuff like this just makes it that much harder to get things done.
X: I don't let it bother me.
Kagato: Well, you don't have to do any of the planning either.
X: Right. Well, have fun. I'm going for a walk.

Kagato, Shu, Yosho, and Zechs all sit down to begin planning their strategy.

X: Hey!
Kagato: I thought you were going for a walk.
X: Well I was, but then something made me change my mind.
Zechs: And what was that?
X: That guy out there.

They all look outside to see the man X is pointing at. As they all realize who it is,
fear begins to creap up their spines.

Kagato: Oh no, it can't be him!
Zechs: How did he get here? How did this happen?
Shu: We must do something quickly!
Yosho: Explain yourself now!
Fabio: I have been sent by Cosby to kill you all.
X: Well, that sounds reasonable enough. Hey, wait a minute!
Kagato: Say, would you mind coming back tomorrow? We're in the middle of a big planning
	thingy, working out some strategery and-
Shu: That isn't a word.
Kagato: What?
Shu: Strategery is not a word.
Kagato: Hey, just shut up and let me talk to the guy who's been sent here to kill us all.
Fabio: Enough talk, now you die!  

Fabio pulls out a can of I Can't Believe it's Not Butter spray and begins attacking
everyone. What will our heroes do in the face of suck evil? How can they possibly
triumph?


When last we left our heroes, they were facing the evil that is Fabio, and 'I can't
Believe it's Not Butter.'  What will they do?  Find out this and more, on today's episode
of Here's the Deal!

As Alanna steps through the door, she quickly asseses the situation. Her features blur
and change.

Alanna: Hello, fag-boy. Nice of you to join the party. [bounces a bat off her? hand]
Fabio: J...John...Rocker....Excuse me...I just remembered, I have pressing engagement
elsewhere.

He drops the can of not-butter and runs outside. Alanna grins evilly, as her features
shift back to familiarity.

Alanna: Uh...hi, guys. What's going on?

{Well, that was fast, wasn't it?}

Kagato: Well, we're working on our plans for attacking the Zenobian Empire. We need to
	go to the Sky Islands and recruit the three Sky Knights.
X: I can do that!
Kagato: Um, are you sure?
X: Yeah, no problem! Leave everything to me!
Kagato: Well, I guess X will take care of the three Sky Knights. So, what else do we have
	to do? 
Zechs: Well, for starters, we could organize our troops and give them some proper
	training. We should also try to obtain as much info on our enemies as we can.
Shu: I agree.
Kagato: Okay, so who wants to train the troops?
Yosho: I think that Zechs and I can handle that.
Kagato: Well then, who wants to go gather info on our enemies? -silence- Well? -more 
	silence- Okay, fine. Bent, you and Deneb will be in charge of gathering
	intelligence. Any questions?

--The next day...--

X: Hey Sasami, this is some great sashimi!
Sasami: Thanks X!

Kagato walks in.

Kagato: X, what are you doing? You are supposed to be recruiting the three Sky Knights!
X: Hey, relax. I got it taken care of!
Kagato: What the hell are you talking about? You never even left the house!
X: Here, take a look at this.

X hands Kagato a newspaper.  

Kagato: You put an ad in the local paper saying that we are looking for three Sky
	Knights? What the hell is wrong with you???

Suddenly, someone knocks on the door.

Sasami: I'll get it! Oh, hello there. Yes, just a second. Kagato, it's for you!
Kagato: Ugh. Who in the hell could be here now? Probably just someone else looking to
	kill us all. Hello, what do you-

Kagato gazes in stunned silence at the three Sky Knights.

Fogel: Well, are you Kagato?
Slust: I saw this ad in the paper. So what do you want with us?
Fenril: Um, can we come inside? It's been quite a long trip. 
Kagato: ....I don't believe this...
X: See? I told you I had it taken care of. You really should have more faith in me.
Kagato: Well, at any rate, let's get down to business.

--Meanwhile, in the Dimension of Darkness...--

Yuzuha: Say, that guy seems interesting. Maybe I should pay him a visit.
Stuffed Animal no. 34: Yuzuha is finally better!
Stuffed Animal no. 9: Hurray!

--Back at the Tenchi household...--

X: Man, dinner was good. Sasami is a great cook. Well, I guess I'll take a walk in the
	woods. I should probably be careful though. Cosby's minions might be lurking
	about.

And so, X goes for a walk.

--After he leaves his room...--

Yuzuha: What? He was here just a second ago! Well, I guess I'll just keep looking for
	him.  

After Yuzuha leaves, Yosho walks into the room.

Yosho: Hm....I wonder what Yuzuha is up to.

--The sky above the Masaki household is a nice clear blue except for that tell tale
anime twinkle...--

Babobo: HOLY CRAP! WE'RE GOING DOWN!!!
Flaming Homemade Gear Queso: I must agree and concur whole heartedly.
Babobo: What kind of thing is that to-

And with a thunderous splash the plummeting homemade Gear Queso sank like a homemade
gear to the bottom of the lake in front of Tenchi's house. Seconds later, the tidal wave
washes ashore a life raft with a soaking, disgruntled Babobo on board carrying a small
furby and a satchel.

Babobo: You have a lot of explaining to do.  And why do I feel like I just went from an
	OAV to a TV show?
Queso: What?
Babobo:[lighting cigarette] You know, same characters and all. Just different situations
	and such. 
Queso: I have the sneaking suspision I was a lot bigger and cool looking until a few
	hours ago... 
Babobo:[rumageing through satchel] Quit your bitchen and help me row us ashore.

An acute observation on the structure of Furbies and five minutes of solitary rowing
later Babobo makes it ashore...Just in time for the Tenchi Cup beach volleyball
tournament.

Babobo: Sweet.

--Shortly thereafter--

Babobo: That was nuts!
Queso: I want hands again.
Babobo: Well, we can talk to Washu about getting your body back.

And so Babobo and his Furby bravely made their way from the front yard into the Masaki
household. Dodgeing blasts of orange energy and diving past electric bits of wood
Babobo and the heart of his homemade gear arrive in Washu's lab, under the stairs.

Washu: Well, hi Babobo, I see you brought El Queso.
Babobo: More or less.
Washu: Looks like less.
Queso: You aren't looking as big as you were earlier either.
Washu:[ignoring Queso's comment] Well, raising things out of the lake isn't something I
	do often but I'll do it for the grumpy Furby. Use this.

Words across screen: Babobo got Gear Jack.

Babobo: Sweet.  

--The forest...--

Alanna: Hello X. Pleasnt night out tonight, isn't it?  

X jumps, startled. He hadn't seen or heard anything to indicate someone else was out
here.  

X: Alanna! You startled me. Where are you?
Alanna: Right here.  

She steps out from the bushes behind X.

X: How the New Jersey did you do that?  
Alanna: Sore wa himitsu desu. Anyways, Yuzuha is here, seeking revenge on Yosho through
	Tenchi. Be on your gaurd.  

She fades back into the bushes, without making the slightest sound.

X: Wait! Why do I have to be on gaurd?
Alanna: [faint] Sore wa himitsu desu.
X: You just don't know, do you?
Alanna: [pause][cheery, faint] Nope! Lovely night out, though, isn't it?

--At the same time--

And so Queso was restored to his body and put in a make shift dock in Washu's lab.

Washu: You know, that wasn't free.
Babobo: Pardon?
Washu: There is a fee.
Babobo: [bad Juju sense tingling] Don't have any yen. Sorry. 
Washu:[already in nurse outfit] Into the harness with you. 
Babobo is clamped down by a previously invisible device
Babobo: Aw shit. Could you at least become Big Washu? I was never in touch with my
	pedophiliac side.
Washu: I don't do requests. But I'm feeling generous.
Babobo:[You know someone usualy busts up into this peice and saves Tenchi] Sweet.  

--Back to the forest--

X: Well, I guess I'll be on my guard.  

X promptly walks into a tree branch, trips, and falls down a hill.

X: Ouch....That hurt. Well, time to pass out.

X passes out.

--Some time later...--

???: Are you okay?
X: Huh? Who are you?
Yuzuha: I'm Yuzuha.
X: Yuzuha? Name sounds familiar....Where have I heard that before.....Oh yeah! Alanna
	said that you are here to kill Tenchi and that I should watch out for you.
Yuzuha: Well actually, I've desided not to kill Tenchi.
X: Really? Why?
Yuzuha: Ever seen Shin Tenchi?
X: Ahhhh. So, uh, why are you here?
Yuzuha: Well, I came here to see you!
X: Um, why?
Yuzuha: Well, I watched you while I was in my dimension, and you seemed like a pretty
	interesting person, so I figured I would find you hang out with you for a while.
X: Oh. Well, that sounds good. Say, I need to get back to the house soon. They might be
	looking for me. Do you wanna come?
Yuzuha: Well, I don't know...
X: Hey, it'll be okay. Don't worry about anything.

And so, X and Yuzuha head back to the house.

--At the house...--

Kagato opens the door to Washu's lab and goes inside.
 
Kagato: Washu? Hello! Are you there? Oh, hey Babobo. When did you get here? Why are you
	bound and gagged?
Babobo: Mmph! Mmph dhrn phrnm mmph!
Kagato: Huh?
Washu: Hey Kagato, what can I do for you?
Kagato: Oh, Washu, it's you. Listen, I need some more ice for the party.
Washu: Okay, coming right up.
Kagato: Thanks Washy. Say, why do you have Babobo tied up like that?
Washu: Oh, no special reason.
Kagato: Washu, are you trying to get samples from him?
Washu: Yes.
Kagato: Washu, release him at once!
Washu: No!
Kagato: What if I go get Tenchi?
Washu: Um.....okay!

Some time later...

Babobo: Thanks.
Kagato: No problem.
Tenchi: Washyuu stop! Please!
Washu: I'm an angel of mercy Tenchi!

Kagato and Babobo look at eachother.

Kagato: Uh...let's get out of here!
Babobo: Agreed.

--Bent returns form his trip to gather information...--

Kagato: So what did you find out?
Bent: Um, well [pulls out a long list] There's this evil mage, that got this evil
	stone..., and he want to summon some evil demon, and have the demon do evil
	stuff....
Kagato: And..?
Bent: That's about it...
Kagato: What? What about the rest of the list?
Bent: Well, that's our traveling cost receipts.

Kagato looks at the sum.

Kagato: !!!![Sweat drop forms] HOW ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS!?

Bent shrugs, unknowing.  Just then, a strange looking man walks in.

Kagato: Who the hell are you?
Man: I'm Doug, I'll supply you funds, in exchange for [whispers in Kagato's ear]...
Kagato: You're kidding...Fine, here. [Kagato hands Doug some dojinshi]
Doug: Nice doing business with you...

Following the debacle in Washu's lab, Babobo thought it would be best if he camped on
the far side of the Eirhart Pond.

Babobo: This is the best vacation ever, isn't it, El Queso?
(Washu restored Queso to nearly- unfathonable homemade Omnigear El Queso)
El Queso: Yes.
Babobo: You doing okay over there Guys?
Mastermune: You betcha'!
Babobo: This is so great. I hope it stays this way forever.
(But then again things never stay the same, especially Here's the Deal, now designed for
hyper short attention spans!!)

--At the house...--

Kagato: Well, everything seems to be taken care of. The troops have been trained, X got
	the sky knights, and Bent was able to get some info on our enemy. Say, where is
	X anyways?

X walks in with Yuzuha.

X: Hey, what's up?
Alanna: It's Yuzuha! X, get back!
X: Hey, wait a second!

Alanna rushes at X and knocks him aside. X crashes through a nearby wall.

X: Oww...
Kagato: Hey, what's going on here? I'm trying to plan our battle strategy!
Alanna: That's Yuzuha, the demon of darkness! She's here to kill Tenchi!
X: Oww....man, that really hurt. Is that true Yuzuha? Are you here to kill Tenchi?
Yuzuha: Hey, I already told you that after I saw Shin Tenchi I desided not to attack him!
Alanna: You're lying! Take this!

Alanna changes into her wylde form and fires a volley of hellbores at Yuzuha.

X: Alanna, stop!

X dives in front of Yuzuha, shielding her from the blast. Everyone watches in silence as
the smoke clears and X falls to the ground.

Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="green" size=2>Oops...X! Are you all right?</font>

Alanna rushes to X, and helps him up off the floor. She glares venomously at Yuzuha.

Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="crimson" size=2>You...this is all your fault!</font>

Alanna begins to glow a dull red, laced with blue. Lightning begins to crackle around
her. Yuzuha watches with interest.

X: Alanna...stop...please. She...may be...telling *gasp* the truth...
Kagato: Um...Alanna? Are you gonna be done anytime soon? We have to plan battle strategy
	sometime today.
X: Please...

Alanna lets out a howl of rage, and a ravenous flood of energy erupts from her, barely
missing Yuzuha, chewing a large hole into the side of the house. It continues, and gouges
a channel into the earth, before vanishing into the distance.

(Elsewhere: An alien fleet, bent on conquering the galaxy, has just entered the Sol
system, clustered around a battleship 4 times more powerful than the Soja. Unfortunately,
their shield generators are malfunctioning right now, and the techs are working around
the clock to repair them. Undetected, until too late, the energy beam released by Alanna
strikes the ship. The ship is nearly vaporized, and its matter/antimatter reactor is
heavily damaged. It goes critical, exploding and destroying the rest of the fleet. In
half an hour, the light from the explosion will reach the earth, and scientists will
wonder at its meaning and origin.)

Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="green" size=2>I feel better now. X, are you all right?</font>

X: I've felt better. You know, you remind me of Ryoko sometimes. 
Alanna: Huh? Really? 
X: Yeah. Ow!  
X clutches his side and falls to one knee.  

Yuzuha: Are you alright, X? 
X: Hey, don't worry about me. I told you I'd protect you didn't I? 
Kagato: If you all are quite done, we need to finish planning.  
Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="green">I'm really sorry, X. I guess I...overreacted
	a little.</font>

Alanna looks down, at the hole in X's side. A small bolt of lightning jumps from Alanna's
outstretched hand to X.  

Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="green">There. That should take care of that. I'm so
	lucky...and so are you. Don't ever do something as stupid as jumping in front of
	something I'm about to blast again, okay?</font>
X: I'll...keep that in mind.  
Alanna: <font face="georgia" color="green">Sorry about the wall, Tenchi.</font>
Tenchi:[nervously] Qu..quite all right...

--Later, at the meeting... --

Shu: The forces of the Zenobian Empire are quite strong, ad Bent's report has shown. The
	only way that we can beat them is to attack them simultaniously from several key
	points. 
Zechs: That's right. Kagato's group will head to the Kalbi Peninsula while mine heads
	for the Balmorian ruins. X will lead a small group into Antalia and then to
	Antanjyl. The rest of you will head for the Dalmuhd Desert and then Fort
	Shulamana. Should any of us fail, the entire operation will be compromised.
Yosho: We must not fail. Rashidi seeks to revive Diablo, the God of Destruction. We must
	stop him at all costs.
Kagato: Well, if everyone knows there assignments, it's time to form groups. I'll take
	Yosho, Tenchi and Heero. Ryoko, Kiyone, and Ayeka will cover our backs and give
	us support.
Zechs: I'll be taking Babobo, Duo, and Wufei. Trowa and Quatre will be covering our
	advance and taking care of any surprises that the enemy might have for us.
Bent: Me and Deneb are gonna take Slust and Fogel with us as we infiltrate Fort
	Shulamana.
X: I guess I'm next. -ahem- I'm taking Alanna, Yuzuha, and Fenril.
Shu: In addition, each of your groups will be taking a battalion of our troops. All of
	the gears and mobile suits have been repaired, and the rest of the soldiers are
	in top physical condition.
Kagato: Well, I guess that takes care of everything. We will leave in three days, so
	make sure you are all ready to go.
Alanna: Diablo? Why does that sound familiar...Hmmmm. Will the gears and mobile suits
	be able to keep up with us? I don't want to be slowed down.
X: Hm...I think I'll go down and check on my gear.

X head to the gear hanger and stands before his gear, Tiamat.

X: Hmph. We sure have been through a lot, haven't we? So much fighting. Well, I think
	I'll take you out for a test run, just to make sure that all of your systems
	are operating correctly.

Just then, Zechs walks up.

Zechs: Are you going out? Would you like to spar with me?
X: Sure. I assume you'll be using the Tallgeese 3?
Zechs: Of course.
X: Well then, Lightning Count, let's see how good you are.
Zechs: I see that your suit is unarmed. I wouldn't want any unfair advantages, so I'll
	have my mega cannon removed before we begin.
X: Sounds good to me.

And so, X and Zechs began their mock battle. X couldn't match the Tallgeese's speed, but
he managed to hold his ground against Zechs. As the two continues their battle, the rest
of the group gathered outside the Masaki house to watch.

Kagato: X is pretty good. Of course, I doubt he could stand up to Zechs if Zechs was
	fighting to his full abilities. But then, neither is X.
Babobo: Hey, I got 50 Jurai on the Lightning Count!
Alanna: I got 100 on X!
Kagato: Well, this is getting interesting.

Narrator:[Hamel] A single bird chirps and takes flight from a branch as a warm breeze
	stirs the trees around the Masaki household. And, on cue high up the sky seems
	to shatter and something that's a blur of blue and red flies straight down
	through the stratosphere. After gaining terminal veloscity it hits the water
	around the aincient tree on the grounds. It seems to split off in two as one
	seems to land on the water itself and the other (not as lucky) files through the
	water and up several feet from the bank.

X: ...! That entrance...
Babobo: That overblown overpaid narrator of the week... 
Alanna: What..?
Zechs: Who is interrupting our sparring match?
X: It has to be.
X and Kagato: Tonnica?!

Narrator:[Hamel] Sure enough, mostly buried up to her head in mud is the overly
	flamboyant and pointless Knight of Gruyere.

Tonnica: KAGATO! [jumps out of the mud]
Kagato: Uh... -_-;  
Tonnica: It's so good to see you all! I brought presents and snacks. Gimme a HUG!

Narrator:[Hamel] And Tonnica proceeds to strangle hug Kagato before he can get out of
	the way. In the process she nearly leaves a nasty hole in him with the Atma
	Weapon she's holding in her hand.

Tonnica: So how's it going? Is there a barbecue on? I love barbecue.
Babobo:[holdong coffee mug] I'd like a barbeque. But there's no meat in Japan...
Kagato: Well then, let's have a barbeque. 
X: Well Zechs, I guess we're done sparring for now. 
Zechs: I hope we have lots of ribs.  

--Later, at the barbeque...--

X: Man Sasami, this food is great!
Alanna: It sure is.
Sasami: Well, Washu helped.

X and Alanna look at their food and slowly put down their plates.

X: I suddenly feel quite full.
Alanna: Me too.
Washu: Hey! You two had better keep eating, or I'll have to insist that you come help me
	in my lab!
X: Uh....

They both quickly pick up their plates and continue eating.  

Having noticed the disturbing lack of cows in Japan, babobo and El Queso contribute to
the cattle disappearances in the midwest, and return with many a dressed cow.

Babobo: Alright, direct us to the pit.
Mihoshi: What pit?
Babobo:[cockpit opens] You mean you're trying to have a barbeque and don't have a pit?
	Well, this must be rectified. El Queso!  Prepare the Heavenly Nadir cheese weasel
	rail cannon. 
Tenchi: Hey isn't that a little dangerous?
Babobo: I find your lack of faith disappointing.

And after the obligatory destruction of that part of Tenchi's house nobody uses, probably
because it's always being blown apart, the feast officially became a barbeque with the
addition of a pit.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next time on Here's the Deal, the aftermath of the barbeque...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Last time, on Here's the Deal, we left our heroes at a barbeque...what will happen next?

Narrator:[Hamel] Tonnica stands at a barbecue with a roating pan on it. A heavenly smell
drifts up from it but she keeps beating off anyone who is curious about it 'until it's
done'. Even if she keeps taking bites of it.

Tonnica: So anyway [CHOMP] I actually ended up running into nest of Chocobo eggs and
	playing Chocobo Hot and Cold. That's when I finally convinced the Fat Chocobo to
	send me back to earth. Plus I now have some of the best equipment available-
Alanna: Um... Shouldn't you be paying attention to what you're cooking?
Tonnica: It's fine. Fish always barbecues nicely wrapped in foil. [munch] So anyway I've
	got this neat thing that...

Narrator:[Hamel] A silence descends over the group.

Tonnica: I ate it all... Um... Oh! I hear there's sales on garages at Costco. That's one
	of the bits of news I brought. So... Who wants barbecued fish bones..? And... 
	[rifles around in her shoulder bag] Chocolate Pocky of Power? Who wants the 
	Chocolate Pocky of Power? 
X: Ooh! Ooh! I do!

X jumps up and down, waving his arms.

Tonnica: Here you go Trowa.
Trowa: Thanks.
X: What!!! Hey, that is my Chocolate Pocky of Power!!!
Trowa: Tonnica gave it to me!
X: That's it pretty boy, you're going down!
Trowa: Fine. Let's fight.

X and Trowa begin wrestling on the ground. X keeps punching Trowa in the gut, while Trowa
kicks X in the head. Eventually they roll into the lake. Meanwhile...

Duo: Hey, what's this? A Chocolate Pocky of Power? Sweet.
Tonnica: HEY! Stop fighting I gave that to Trowa fair and square.
Narrator:[Hamel] Tonnica gets her kicking leg ready and tackles X and Trowa. Suddenly A.C
	appears.
A.C: Ooo! Kinky. Can I join? You know I never expected this of you, Tonnica. You're such
	a boy hog.
Tonnica:[goes red] You..! I challenge you to air hockey... To the DEATH!
A.C: I don't think so. I've got...Things to do.

Narrator:[Hamel] A.C blows a kiss and dissapears (again). A tumbleweed blows by. X,
	Trowa, and Tonnica get up and dust themselves off.

Tonnica: Besides I have a whole box to share and- where is the box..?

Duo: [burp]

Tonnica: Let's get him! Besides, we need to give some of the Pocky to Hiro because it
	works as an antidepressant. Oh well... Y'know Trowa you look alot like Flavius.
Trowa: ... I think I'll just go over here now... [scoot]

Alanna: Hey, Wufei! You wann go a quick round with me?
Wufei: Women are weak. I don't fight people who are weak.
Alanna: Why not? Scared?
Wufei:[condescending] No. You couldn't possibly hurt me. You're too weak.

Everyone who was in the house before the planning session slooowly backs away from Wufei.

Alanna: Might I suggest you retract that statement before I do something that Kagato will
	regret.
Wufei: Huh? Hmmph. You couldn't hurt me if you tried.
Alanna: Nataku sucks! And your hair is nasty.
Wufei: You take that back! Nataku is strong! Stronger than you ever could be.
Alanna: Yeah? Prove it.

Wufei growls and summons Nataku from a conveniently located underground hanger. He gets
in and jumps Nataku towards Alanna.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Yay! A fight!!</font>
Kagato: Remember, Alanna. We need him alive. So no barbecued chinese for breakfast, kay? 
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Oh, all right, Kagy-poo.</font>

Alanna dodges the dragon claws first strike easily, and blasts back with a Hellbore,
destroying Nataku's left claw.  

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Do we need his gundam, too?</font>
Kagato: Yes, we do need the Gundam. Well, I guess Washu can repair it if you don't
	damage it too much.
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Yay! Thanks Kagy-poo.</font>
X: Kagy-poo?
Kagato: Don't ask.
X: Kagy-poo. Hahahaha!
Kagato: That's it, you're going down!
X: Hey, quit it! Oh, that hurts!
Kagato: Next time, I'll give you even more noogies.
X: Geez, that hurt. Oh well, I'm gonna go eat some more food. Sasami, do we have any
	more ribs?
Sasami: Sorry X, Zechs ate the rest of them?
X: What??? NO!!!
Yuzuha: Here X, you can have the rest of my ribs.
X: Wow, thanks Yuzuha.

--Meanwhile, over by the pit...--

Ryoko: Hey, you leave Tenchi alone!
Mayuka: Daddy, save me!
Tenchi: Ryoko, stop! Calm down!
Ayeka: Miss Ryoko, stop this at once!
Mihoshi: Hey, calm down. Huh? Oh, WHOA!!! 

Mihoshi trips and knockes everyone into the lake.

--At the BBQ--  
Bent walks up to Kagato.

Bent: Hey Kagato, have you seen Deneb?
Kagato: Yeah, she walked off with Slust.
Bent: Slust? Oh my...

Just then the strange man by the name of Doug walks up to Bent and Kagato carrying a
video camera.

Bent: Um...
Kagato: No, I'm not selling you anymore dijinshi.
Doug: Actually, I was wondering if you would like to buy something. [Doug whispers into
	Kagato's ear]
Kagato: YOU GOT WHO ON CAMERA!?
Bent: Who?
Kagato: Deneb, and Slust, FINE! BUT SASAMI!!!!!

Everyone at the BBQ stops what there're doing and stares at Doug.

Doug: I...think...I'll be leaving now...

As Doug turned and began to run away, X suddenly appears before him.

X:[Vash the Stampede] Hold on there! I cannot allow you to leave after what you have
	done! Now you must pay for your crime! 
Doug: Huh?
X: We're all gonna beat you up.
Doug: Oh.

Doug looks around to see that almost everyone at the Barbeque has surrounded him. Ryoko
looks particularly mad.

Doug: Uh...
Ryoko: You're not getting away!

And so, Doug is quickly beaten to a bloody pulp by all of the party goers. Afterwards,
they all go back to enjoying themselves, and watching Alanna and Wufei battle it out.

--The battle--

Alanna stands perfectly still, in the shadow of Nataku. Wufei, in his cockpit, sees this
and laughs.

Wufei: Do you give up, woman? Do you admit the superior strength of Nataku?
Alanna:[insanely cheerful] <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">I admit nothing...
	except for the fact that you are an overbearing sexist pig.</font>
Wufei: Errggh.

The Nataku jumps into the air, and smashes down at the location where Alanna had been
standing.

Alanna: [still cheerful] <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Did you miss me? I'm
	sorry.</font>
Wufei: Arrgggh!

Nataku swings around, and bullets hose the area where Alanna had been standing moments
ago.  

Alanna:[cheerful] <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Missed again! Want another
	shot?</font>
Wufei: Arrggh! Gundammit, woman, stand still!
Alanna: Okay! Standing still. 

Wufei brings Nataku around, and feints at her with the beam trident. She doesn't move an
inch. Nataku comes forward, and steps on her. Alanna begins to glow slightly, and a hole
is melted in Nataku's foot around her.  

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Guys! That's not fair! I wanted to
	beat up Doug, too!</font>
Wufei: Shut up and fight, woman.  
Alanna: Yeah, yeah. Be with you in a sec, Wufei. 
Wufei: Arrggghhhh!!!!  

Wufei tries to attack Alanna with the beam trident. She dodges without looking, and
Wufei barely avoids cutting his own leg off.

Wufei: Woman! Take this duel seriously!
Alanna: Hmmm? Okay. 

Alanna assumes a fighting stance. Wufei copys her, moving Nataku around far more warily
then when he started the fight. He attacks, and Alanna dodges far more slowly than she
had been.  

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Good...good. Stay wary.</font>

Wufei: Don't presume to instruct me, woman.  

He attacks in rage, and Alanna lets off a blast that throws Nataku a hundred feet back,
without damaging it too much.  

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Stay calm, focused. Don't let your
	rage take control.</font>

Nataku gets up, and moves towards Alanna.

Babobo is far too busy cooking and pulling the barbeque to notice the ensueing carnage
until out of the corner of his eye he sees Wufie and Alanna.

Babobo: Hey, go easy, Alanna.  I need him and Nataku for our trio to Balmoria.
Zechs: I have the feeling noone is takeing our mission seriously.
Babobo:[returns to cooking] Hey, you guys keep that fire stoked!
Mastermune: Geez! We're doing our best.
lil' Washu: Hey there, Babobo.
Babobo:[thought bubble] Crap what is with me and these 13 year old girls...
lil' Washu: I'm over 30,000 you know. 
Babobo:[distracted from his work] Hey, stop reading the thought balloons. 
lil' Washu: Stop writing them down. 
Zechs:[laughing] She's got you there.
Babobo: Crap!
lil' Washu: You can't outwit the greatest super genius in the universe  

X is sitting on the grass talking to Yuzuha as Bent walks up.

Bent: Hey X, what's up?
X: Hey Bent. I was just telling Yuzuha about the evil sausages.
Bent: You mean the evil sausages?
X: Uh-huh. I just got done explaining to her how one goes about scaring away a large
	group of sausages.
Bent: How does one go about doing that?
Yuzuha: Well, first you must get some toothpaste, a watch, and either tabasco sauce or
	chili powder. Tabasco works better. Then you just eat all the toothpaste and
	tabasco sauce while beating your left knee with the watch. The sausages will
	think that you are a fire breathing tree turtle from West Virginia, and they will
	run away.
Bent: Fire breathing tree turtle?
X: Yeah. Fire breathing tree turtles from West Virginia are the evil sausages only
	natural predator.
Bent: Interesting. I must remember that.

Bent walks away carrying some toothpaste, a watch, and Tabasco sauce.

Bent: Now which came first....? 

Bent promptly puts the toothpaste and tobacco sauce into his month and starts beating
his right knee with the watch. Kagato sees what Bent is doing.

Kagato: NOOOOOOO!!!!! BENT!!! YOUR LEFT KNEE!!! 

Bent adjusts his beating, but it is already too late, a sub space temporal vortex has
already been opened, to who knows where.

Bent: MMMmmmm...[Spits] Mmm...Whoops... 
Kagato: DAMMIT BENT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE DONE!? 
Bent: Um...
Kagato: We're all going to die!!!
Bent: No we're not...
Kagato: WHAT!? Dare you challenge me!?
Bent: No...But why are we going to die?
Kagato: Because you've just open a portal to [whispers into Bent's ear]
Bent: Oh my.. I think we will be ok though...
Kagato: No we won't were going to die...

The portal suddenly closes.

Bent: See told ya... 
Kagato: What!! How!! 

Bent shows Kagato the materials he used.

Bent: They're all generic. Let’s see...Food Lion toothpaste and the watch isn't even
	waterproof, and the Tabasco sauce is labeled mild.
Kagato: .......[Kagato shakes his head and walks away]

Babobo: Well, this has been fun and all (stretches arms) But I thnk I'm gonna head back
	to camp now. Bye.

(and with that Babobo2 slips away into the night and across the waters of Eirhart Pond.
Unfortunately Babobo wasn't paying attention and so missed the figure with the crab
shaped head following him. This bodes poorly for our drunken hero, what will happen? I
honestly don't know.)

Kagato: Yeah, it is getting pretty late. We should all probably get some rest. 
Sasami: But Kagato, Alanna and Wufei are still fighting. 
Kagato: Damn, that's right. Hey! You two stop fighting right now! We all need to get
	some rest! 
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Fine Kagy-poo.</font>
Wufei: We can finish this fight later woman.
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Yeah, and I plan on finishing what I
	started.</font>
Kagato: Oh man. This might cause problems later.
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Did you say something Kagy-poo?</font>
Kagato: No, nothing.
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">I guess that's enough training for 
	today, Wu.</font>
Wufei: Training? Do you mean you were just toying with me?!  
Alanna:[blinks] <font face="georgia' size=2 color="green">Umm...yeah. You really need to
	work on your overconfidence some, Wufei. But you did start controlling your anger
	better! I'm proud of you. Another few training sessions, and you should be a much
	</font>more effective warrior. Tomorrow, I'll see if I can't arrange a more even
	training match between us. Maybe I'll see if Washu can build me a gear...hmmm.
	Oh, yeah. You...uh...might want to get Nataku repaired. Washu should have the
	parts.

Wufeui turns around and looks at Nataku. He looks again. Nataku is badly burned, with
paint seared off all over the front, a hole in the right foot, complete with a gash
just above it. The left arm is crippled, the primary actuators fused and unresponsive.
New Jersey, even the vulcans had run out of ammo. He looked back at the slim woman who
had caused this destruction so easily, and without breaking a sweat. She smiles
disarmingly at him.

Wufei: What are you?

Her smile flickers, and fades.

Alanna: ...
X: It's none of your business. We should all get some rest. It'll be a busy day tomorrow.

Alanna and X walk away, leaving behind Wufei, who has an unreadable expression on his
face.

Alanna: Thank you.

X: For what?

Alanna: ...Just...thank you, that's all.

--Later that night...--

Kagato: Oh man, what a day. Alanna almost totaled Wufei's gundam, and Bent almost killed
	us all. Well, now that I think about it, that's just par for the course.
Yosho: We must remain vigilant. There is no telling when the enemy might try to surprise
	us.

Just then, Mayuka walks in.

Mayuka: Grandfather, have you seen my Daddy?
Yosho: I believe that Tenchi said something about taking a bath.
Mayuka: A bath? Yay! I'm coming Daddy!

As Mayuka runs out of the room, Kagato shakes his head.

Kagato: I'm not sure that was a good idea.
Yosho: And what makes you say that?
Kagato: Just call it a hunch.
Ryoko: Hey, I've been looking for you two. Wanna drink some sake?
Kagato: Well, why the New Jersey not?

As the three of them began a long night of drinking, around the rest of the house the
other members of the group relaxed, enjoying their last few nights before setting off to
do battle with the Zenobian Empire.

That night, we find Alanna sitting outside the house, looking at the moon.

X: What's wrong, can't sleep?
Alanna: Oh, hi X. No, I can't.
X: Well, what's wrong?
Alanna: I don't know. Guess I'm just a little nervous about fighting the Empire.
X: You, nervous? Gimma a break! You're an excellent fighter. Me and the others will be
	with you, so you've got nothing to worry about.
Alanna: Thanks X. I feel better now. Doesn't the moon look great tonight?
X: Yeah, it sure does. Of course, it appears to be floating ominously close to the Earth,
	not unlike that one Zelda game. 
Alanna: ....
X: Oh, hahaha, sorry.
Alanna: It's okay. X, what do you see when you look up at the stars?
X: I dunno, stars.
Alanna: Oh come on, be serious. Tell me what you see when you look up at the night sky.
	What dreams does it show you?
X: What....dreams?

X gazes up at the moon. The moonlight seems brighter, and he begins to see a vision
before him. He sees a man, standing in a sea of flames, a look of satisfaction in his
face. Huge crimson wings hang from his back. X stands up and staggers backward.  

X: What? I don't-
Alanna: X, what's wrong?
X: No, I'm not, it's not me. I-

X suddenly collapses to the ground.

Alanna: X! Wake up! X? What's wrong?

Alanna: X!! X, are you alright!? 

Suddenly, Alanna goes flying toward the house and stops just inches before crashing into
it.

X: uhg...
Familiar voice: You should always be on your guard, never think you are safe, there is
	always that 1% chance you are not.

Alanna: You!!!

She quickly turns around to be greeted by an Saiya-jin she recognizes all to well.

Alanna: You!! You're...you're...  
Cid: What was once Zero. I am here for something. I am a kink in your plans, so to speak.
Alanna: Like hell you are!
X: Alanna...
Alanna: X, wait here, I promise I won't be long!
X: hmmm...

Alanna rushes out to meed Cid.

Cid: So what are you doing, you useless warrior? 

He keeps his dark brown eyes focused on Alanna

Cid: You seem to have grown some in power...lets say you and I duel...for old times sake?
Alanna: No, and besides. I just kicked Wufei's ass, I can surely take you on.
Cid: Arrogance doesn't get you anywhere, milady, and you are not getting out of this
	fight, unless you live. [smirk]
Alanna: I am not arrogant, you are just weak.
Cid: Believe what you wish...

The wind begins to pick up, and Cid's raven hair begins to sway with it, slowly inching
to stand atraight up...His eyes still focused, his cold glare begins to flash from dark
brown, to light blue, his hair changing from black to golden blonde. Small rocks and
debris begin to pick up around him as he takes stance and lets out a loud yell, standard
to powering up. Just then his hair completely changes to golden blonde, and his eyes
complete their color change...The ground begins to sink beneath him, creating a crater
near the Masaki house. What were once small rocks and debris begin to chunk off from the
earth in large masses as his focus becomes deeper, the sky now overshadowed by clouds
that threaten to burst with lightning and rain loom over like a sheet on a cold earth.
Cid then lets out one more yell and his muscle mass more than doubles, and he increases
in height by about 6 inches.

Cid: Hahah, now woman, you will feel my wrath, time has passed, and I have grown
	stronger, much stronger than you can imagine!!!

Silvery lightning sparks about Cid, in bright flashes, and a golden aura surrounds him,
as a visual sign of his immense power.

Cid: Are you ready?  

Alanna: Oh, I am more than ready. On my word..ready, set...

Just as she says set, she attempts to get a cheap shot on Cid, only to be met by his
fist hitting her with earthshattering force in the gut.

Cid: I don't take kindly to cheaters. 

He lifts Alanna up and kicks her away like a rag doll, and she stuggles to regain
balance, and does, just before slamming into a rather large tree.

Cid: So, shall we begin? [smirk]
