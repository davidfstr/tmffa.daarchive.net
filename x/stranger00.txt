The Stranger
Author:  The SoJ
Prologue

Hey everyone!  I know, shame on me for starting a new fanfic before I 
finish the old ones.  I'm a terrible person and I don't deserve to 
live.  Anyways, this new one was inspired by whoever said that there 
were to many DBZ crossovers and someone should try Lord of the Rings.  
I hate to say it, but there is such thing as too much DBZ.  However, 
there is no such thing as too much LOTR.  Just so everyone gets it 
straight, basically the only member of the Fellowship in this story is 
Legolas, because everyone else either died or went to the Blessed 
Realm.  So, Legolas is the only one left.  That's all anyone needs to 
know.  Enjoy!

	Legolas sighed as he looked out at the setting sun.  It had been 
so many years since the Third Age had ended.  The sea had called to 
him, and he had answered.  But now, now he longed for the cool forests 
and rivers of Middle Earth.  The sea could not fulfill that longing, no 
matter what.
	It hadn't seemed so bad until Gimli died.  True, they hadn't 
gotten on well at first, but they had grown to be good friends.  But 
sadly, Gimli had contracted an illness during one of his many voyages 
with Legolas.  He was given to the sea a few days ago.
	As for the others, they were all gone as well.  King Elessar had 
died and was now buried in Gondor, with Merry and Pippin at his side.  
Boromir had died long ago, in a battle with Orcs.  Frodo and Gandalf 
had crossed the sea, and were later followed by Sam.  Only Legolas was 
left now.
Lost in thought, Legolas hadn't noticed until now that the wind 
was picking up.  His sails were flapping clumsily and white caps were 
forming on the water.  Running to the helm and he grabbed the wheel, 
but the wind was growing stronger every minute.  He gasped as a huge 
whirlpool opened in the ocean just a few hundred yards ahead of him.  
Slowly, it was drawing his ship in.  Legolas fought to regain control 
of the wheel, but it was no use.  The ship was swallowed by the water.

	Deep within her lab, Washu typed eagerly on her laptop.  She had 
almost proven it.  She had almost proven other universes, parallel to 
the one she was in, existed.  If she could only get proof.
	Suddenly, she was interuppted by the sound of footsteps.  Tenchi 
burst through the door, clearly worried.
	"Washu?  Have you been doing any experiments lately?"  he asked 
anxiously.  Washu gave him a puzzled look.
	"No, not in the last 14.7294 hours.  I've just been doing 
research.  Why?" she replied.
	"There's something you should see," Tenchi answered, and Washu 
followed him out the door.  
	On the lake, a huge small sailing ship had appeared. 
	"What the?" Washu trailed off, too stunned for words.  The others 
soon joined.
	"It's a ship like the one's I've seen on TV!" Sasami exclaimed.
	"I wonder where it came from?" Aeka mused.  Ryoko took the more 
direct approach, flying up and landing on deck.  She glanced around 
warily, but nothing seemed to be nearby.  
	"Hey!  Come on up!  It's kinda cool," she called.  Looking 
around, she saw a rope ladder and threw the end of it over the side.  
One by one, the others climbed up.
	It wasn't unusual for an old sailing ship.  It had one cabin, two 
masts, and ripped sails, as though it had been in a storm.  While 
everyone else set out looking around deck, Mihoshi stayed where she 
was.  
	"Kiyone, I'm scared," she whimpered.  Exasperated, Kiyone pulled 
out Mihoshi's gun and put it in her hand.
	"There.  If you see anything that looks threatening, just shoot 
it," Kiyone said flatly.  Mihoshi shivered and looked around.  Nothing 
special.  Except, what was that barrel with the strange letters on it?  
Stepping closer, she saw a dark shape beneath it.  Recognizing what it 
was, she screamed and aimed her gun.
***********************************************************************
*	Legolas awoke to the sound of screaming.  Opening his eyes, he 
saw a young woman with curly blond hair and bright blue eyes pointing a 
strange object at him.  She didn't appear to be threatening, and even 
looked as if she might be an elf herself.
	"Wait!  Where am I?  Who are you?" Legolas asked in elvish.
	Mihoshi stared at him.  What did he say?  It was some weird 
language.
	"KIYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  she screamed, looking around 
frightfully for her partner.  
	From the other side of the ship, Kiyone heard Mihoshi call her 
name.  She sighed and headed over to where she was standing.
	"Probably saw a mouse," she thought to herself.  But it wasn't a 
mouse at all.  It was a person, a man with long blond hair dressed in 
green.  He seemed tired, and was laying on the deck.
	"Mihoshi!  What the heck?" she cried in surprise.  The man stared 
at her.  Finally he took a breath.
	"Please.  My name is Legolas.  My ship was lost in the storm.  
Can you tell me where I am?" he begged.  Kiyone recognized his language 
as a poor form of English.
	"You're in Okayama, Japan.  I'm Kiyone and this is Mihoshi," she 
answered.  The man looked confused.
	"Where is Japan?  And what kind of names are Kiyone and Mihoshi?" 
he asked.
	"What kind of a name is Legolas?" Kiyone retorted.
	"It is an Elvish name meaning 'Greenleaf'.  But I'm still very 
confused," Legolas answered.
	"Elvish?  Do you mean, you're an elf?"  Mihoshi asked.  Legolas 
nodded.
	"But I thought elves were little green short people who live in 
mushrooms and grant wishes and stuff," she said.
	"Well, as you can see, I'm not.  Now, do you know of a place 
where I can have my ship rebuilt?" he asked.  Before either Mihoshi and 
Kiyone could answer, Aeka and Washu ran over.
	"Kiyone!  Mihoshi!  We figured out where this boat came from!"  
Aeka cried.
	"Who are you?" Legolas asked.  Aeka and Washu jumped, startled.
	 
	"Princess Aeka, Miss Washu, this is Legolas.  He's an elf," 
Kiyone explained.
	"How do you do?" Aeka asked, regaining her senses and politeness.
	"Very well, thank you," Legolas added.
	"Wait!  You're an elf!  Then it worked!  My theory is correct!  
This is amazing, even for a genius like myself.  No one's ever been 
able to prove other universes exist!  I'm the first!  I'll be rich!  
I'll be famous!  I'll be--"  Legolas cut her off.
	"I'm sorry my lady, but I can't stay here.  I need to get home.  
If you could only tell me how to get to the Gray Havens," he asked.  
	On the other side of the ship, Tenchi, Sasami, and Ryoko saw a 
young man stand up and
