Rurouni Muyo: Act 2 "A Battousai To The Past"
A multipart X-over Fanfic series
By: LiquidX - Suzuki17@hotmail.com

"Tenchi Muyo!" and characters were created by Hiroki Hayashi and Masaki 
Kajishima and are property of AIC/Pioneer. "Rurouni Kenshin" is the property of 
SPE Visual Studio Works, and "Samurai Shodown" is the property of SNK.   I do 
not own the characters, or the series.  I just write the fiction.

This takes place in the near beginning of the "Tenchi Muyo OVA series", and 
probably the full series of the "Rurouni Kenshin OVA", the Kenshin TV series 
(except the Kurogasa episode) and Samurai Showdown 4, since both Kenshin and 
Samurai Shodown have almost parallel timelines; it would be easy to fuse them 
together.

Meiji 11(1878) - Tokyo

{Quiet Life}
 It had been an hour since the disappearance of Himura Kenshin, from his battle 
with Shirou Amakusa, an evil man of time past, who was dead again, however his 
evil plan had worked to remove Kenshin from protecting the Meiji era, so that 
the future itself can be changed for the demise.  Everyone in the group is weary 
from their battles, since they can do nothing more, they decide to head back to 
Tokyo. However everything is nearly at peace, except that Kenshin is gone.

At the Kamiya Dojo:  Dr. Gensai and Megumi the apprentice had stopped by since 
after Kenshin and the group left to rectify the Amakusa situation.

[Dr. Gensai]  Hello Kaoru-chan, and how are you, Kenshin and my grandkids doing?
[Kaoru]  The grandkids are fine, however Kenshin had left to take care of some 
business.  I hope he comes back soon.
[Megumi] (fox) I hoped so too, I wanted to see him today too.  I guess I'll have 
to wait for him as well.

Sanosuke, Saitoh Hajime, Haomaru, Nakoruru, and the unconscious girl make it 
back to the dojo.
{Talk To The Moon}
[Sano] DOCTOR! WE NEED HELP HERE!
The doctor and the apprentice come out.
[Megumi] What happened here?  You are all injured, however Kenshin is not here 
with you.  (questioning) Where is Kenshin?
[Sano] I'll talk about it later, however we need our injuries treated right now, 
fox woman.
[Dr. Gensai] Bring 'em here.
The group enters the dojo to have their wounds treated.  After a few hours they 
rest.  Megumi and Kaoru have worried expressions on their faces.  Ayame and 
Suzume are with them as well.
[Dr. Gensai] Your injuries are minor, Sanosuke, Saitoh, and Haomaru.  However, 
you Nakoruru had a loss of blood.  I'm surprised that you are still alive after 
what you have been through, and had your wounds treated promptly.  You need to 
rest here for a while.
[Nakoruru]  Thanks to Himura Kenshin for sacrificing the bandages and the 
medicine, I was able to survive that horrible assault with one of the members of 
that evil castle.  Did any of you involved in this situation managed to take 
care of that Hitokiri?
[Group] Nay, we didn't even see him.
[Kaoru] (infuriated) Sano, you better tell me what is going on.  Where is 
Kenshin! He was supposed to be with you!
[Sano] (angry and depressed) ...
[Kaoru] Damn it Sano! Tell me!
Sano gets up and walks to Kaoru.  Sano gets the letter "To Kaoru-dono" from his 
gee pocket, with shaking hands, gives it to her.
{In the Rain}
[Sano] Gomen... Jo-chan.
Kaoru looks at Sano.  Her eyes start turning dark, and starts to cry.  Then she 
opens the letter. In the letter  written in Kenshin's own writing said:

Sorry, Kaoru-dono... if you read this, this means that something had happened to 
me, while trying to protect this fragile nation.  It is a dirty job for me, 
however it was necessary, for I am the only one with the skill necessary to do 
it right.  Forgive me for not being able to tell you this myself rather than 
having someone else to do the job for me.  Remember me in your memories, the 
good and the bad, in your heart.  Grow strong in the Kamiya Kasshin Ryu, and 
train Yahiko well to protect as predecessor.
Goodbye, my love.					Himura Kenshin
[Kaoru] no..... no.   NOOOOO!
Kaoru goes into repression and cries.
[Megumi]  It can't be this way!  Why this?
[Ayame and Suzume] Ken-ni.  (crying)
[Sano] (hitting the ground) Damn that bastard Amakusa!  All because of him 
everything is turning to hell in a handbasket.
Sano leaves the dojo and Saitoh follows him.
[Saitoh]  What are you going to do?
[Sano]  I'm going to send a letter to the Okina at the Aoi'Ya to come here.
[Saitoh] hmmm.
Sano finds the nearest Oniwaban Banchu carrier pigeon in town and sends the 
message to the Okina.
[Sano] It should take a few days to get there, but he will get it.

Present day:
{Kotowari}
Kenshin was allowed to sleep in Tenchi's room while he stays at the Masaki House 
until he finds his answer.  He is dreaming about his mission when he was young.  
In Hiko Seijuro's Mount:
[Hiko Seijuro] You are not allowed to leave the Mountain!
[Kenshin] Seisho, Many die as we speak!  It's time to use Mitsurugi Ryu to 
protect others!
[Hiko Seijuro] Baka! What can you possibly do? You cannot change the world 
yourself, but with others.  To be used politically for your ken; you were not 
taught Mitsurugi-Ryu technique for that purpose.  Don't worry about the world, 
but your training.
[Kenshin] People Suffer. Many are disconsolate.  I can't leave them!
[Hiko Seijuro] Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu is a strong technique - Compare the hardships 
- 
[Kenshin] That's exactly why I must!  I must protect people from hardship!  That 
is Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu's -
[Hiko Seijuro]  The ken is a weapon!  Kenjutsu's a killing technique!  It can't 
possibly be described any other way.  You kill to protect.  Kill so others may 
live, this is Kenjutsu.  Just like I saved you, I killed many, but they were 
human.  During the embroiled times; many struggle to live.  What awaits you are 
killings for justice.  In a different situation, Mitsurugi Ryu would make you a 
murderer.
[Kenshin] Well...  Given this, I wish to protect the suffering!  To protect many 
.... Many lives... with these hands.  With that...
Hiko Seijuro walks away from Kenshin, never to look back.
[Kenshin] Seisho!
[Hiko Seijuro]  I no longer care for an idiot such as you! Go; leave as you 
wish.
[Kenshin] Arigato gosaimasu!
Kenshin remembers the Kamiya dojo. How he was accepted there and welcomed there 
as just a Rurouni.  With a sakabatou he protected everyone that needed it in 
times of trouble.  He also dreamed about the letter given to Sano, since he 
knows that he is gone now.  In his sleep he lets out a tear, just because of 
what Amakusa had done to screw his life completely, not knowing where he is nor 
if it was the Meiji era still.  He wakes up.  He looks around and sees that he 
is the only one up.  He gets up and leaves the room to use the bathroom in the 
hall.
{Tenchi's theme}
[Kenshin]   Oro? I'm so used to the open.  I wonder if I can adjust to this.
Kenshin finally is able to go.  He washes himself up and heads for the living 
room.
[Kenshin]  Such a place this is, and in the middle of nowhere.  I wonder how do 
they get their stuff here?  I'm hungry again, and since I am the only one up, I 
guess that I should show my hospitality here by making the meal here for 
everyone, that I'll do.
Kenshin goes into the kitchen and looks around.  What he sees here it's like a 
restaurant in here, a lot of food is stored here.  This is the first time he 
even sees a refrigerator, for he always got his food fresh. 
[Kenshin]  I know, I'll make something the first time I met Kaoru-dono, miso 
soup and rice balls; that I can do.
Kenshin starts the preparations and starts making the breakfast after fifteen 
minutes.
Outside:
[Kamidake] Ohayo, Azaka
[Azaka] Ohayo, Kamidake.  It's a beautiful morning.
[Kamidake]  it sure is, its peaceful too.
[Both]  Ahhh...
Since it is morning Sasami usually wakes up early, however she overslept.
[Sasami]  It's morning.  I don't feel like doing breakfast today.  I just hope 
it won't be Ryoko doing the cooking today.
Same thing as usual for Tenchi, however this time Ryoko is under Tenchi's 
covers.  Tenchi, as usual struggles to wake himself up.  However he feels 
something next to him that is not normal, as he looks under the covers, he sees 
Ryoko there.
[Tenchi] Gyaaaa!
Tenchi quickly squabbles to run for the door, however he stops and looks back.
[Ryoko] Ohayo Tenchi.
[Tenchi] Oh, It's you Ryoko.  (breaks a sweat)  What were you doing on my bed?
Ryoko disappears and reappears and hugs Tenchi.
[Ryoko] Oh, how considerate of you to think of me.
[Tenchi]  I need to use the bathroom Ryoko.  Lemme go.
[Ryoko] You're no fun.
Ryoko disappears again and Tenchi leaves his room, he looks around and there are 
no obstacles this time to he makes a dash for the bathroom.  Tenchi gets in the 
bathroom and tries to go, but he turns his head left and finds Ryoko looking in 
the bathroom through the wall.
[Tenchi] (uncomfortable) Could you give me some privacy Ryoko?  This is a 
bathroom, you know.
[Ryoko] Tenchi!
Tenchi grabs Ryoko from the wall and kicks her out of the bathroom door and 
shuts it after her.  He finally is able to go.
[Ryoko] (Scratching the door) Tenchi! Tenchi! Tenchi!
Aeka looks at the Bathroom and so does Sasami.  Aeka is disgusted and Sasami is 
chuckling at the scene.
[Sasami]  (smiling)  Ohayo, Ryoko.
[Aeka]  What are you doing to Tenchi-Sama?  What a disgusting act I see right 
now.
[Ryoko] Ohayo, Sasami; and none of your business Aeka.
Suddenly they smell the cooking.  Tenchi gets out and smells the miso soup.
[Tenchi]  I wonder who is cooking the miso soup?  If it isn't you Sasami-chan, 
then who is?
They all run down the stairs and head for the kitchen, as they open the kitchen 
door they see Kenshin doing the breakfast.
[Kenshin] ORO? (breaking sweat).  Ohayo everybody.  Breakfast is ready, that it 
is.
Kenshin gets out the food and heads for the living room. As they all eat, they 
find the food Kenshin made very edible. As Sasami ate one of the rice balls, she 
looks at Kenshin with awe.
[Kenshin] (questioning) Is my cooking that bad, Sasami-chan?
Sasami bows her head then she looks up at Kenshin with one of those dazed looks.
[Sasami] (smiling and pointing a finger)  Your cooking is better than mine, Ken-
niichan.
Kenshin face vaults like a bell.  "Ken-niichan"  he thinks, that sounds like 
Ayame and Suzume, he has a flashback.  [Ayame & Suzume]  Ken-nii Will you play 
with us?  [Kenshin] Sure. They both got on Kenshin's legs. And they are both 
laughing and having fun as Kenshin walks them around. [Dr. Gensai]  He makes a 
great babysitter, doesn't he Kaoru-chan?  You can't find a good warrior with a 
fine heart nowadays.  It makes me feel like a family man again. [Kaoru]  
(chuckling)  he sure does.
[Kenshin]  Kaoru-dono, Gensai Sensei, Ayame and Suzume-chan, I will find a way 
back.
They all laugh with Kenshin.
[Tenchi]  A memory of yours Himura-san?
[Kenshin] (laughing) Yes, a flashback, that it is.
[Aeka]  Your cooking is probably greater than Ryoko's that's for sure.
[Ryoko] You never cooked a day in your life, little princess.
[Kenshin] Oro?
[Tenchi]  I forgot to introduce you to these two.  The one on the left is Aeka 
Jurai, First Crown Princess of Jurai, and the other is Ryoko, a space pirate.  
Sasami Jurai is the Second Crown Princess.
[Kenshin] (breaks a sweat) Oro?  You mean to tell me that they are extra-
terrestrials from another world; that they are?  They look human to me; that it 
is.
[Tenchi] (breaks a sweat) yes.  Ever since they have arrived here, because of 
one of my follies, my life here has been anything but normal.
Katsuhito walks in the Masaki house.
[Katsuhito]  The food smells good in here, did you make this Sasami-chan?
[Tenchi]  Ohayo, Jiichan.  Sasami-chan didn't make this.  Our guest, Himura 
Kenshin-san made this.
[Kenshin]  Ohayo, Masaki-san.  I'm only made this to show my hospitality to give 
thanks here, otherwise I am just a Rurouni here, drifting from place to place 
with no apparent destination, that I am.
*Himura?  Himura Battousai-kun?  The one I knew from the Bakumatsu? Thinks 
Katsuhito.  I should investigate this, Katsuhito judges.
Katsuhito tastes the food, and finds it to be great. All of them eat it all 
until it becomes gone.
[Kenshin]  How did you guys like my cooking?
[ALL] Great.
[Katsuhito]  Tenchi, I came here to tell you that you have kenjutsu training, 
and your chores have to be done at the shrine today.
Kenshin thinks it's a good idea to ask where he is actually.
[Kenshin]  Masaki-san, Where exactly am I at, that is?  I was in Tokyo at one 
time, now I'm here, that is.
[Katsuhito]  You are in Okayama.
[Ryo-Ohki] Miya!
Ryo-Ohki jumps up on Kenshin's shoulder.
[Kenshin] Ohayo, Ryo-ohki-chan.  Lemme get yer breakfast today.
Kenshin heads back to the kitchen to get Ryo-ohki some carrots.  The cabbit 
starts eating it and is satisfied.  Kenshin heads back to the living room.
[Tenchi] Oh, do I have to do that today?
[Katsuhito]  Yes, it is necessary for you do this Tenchi, it is part of your 
training.  Kenshin and Sasami, will you come with us as well?
[Kenshin and Sasami] hai.
[Ryoko] I'm coming too.
[Aeka] Well then, I am staying here.  I don't want to be bothered by that devil-
woman.
As Kenshin, Tenchi, Sasami, Ryoko, and Ryo-Ohki leave for the shrine, a thought 
comes into Kenshin's head about the man who he had to fight yesterday.  He 
finally had to ask about this to Tenchi at the long stairway as they head up for 
their destination.
[Kenshin]  Tenchi-sama, who was that man that I had to face yesterday?  I had 
faced someone like him before in the past, the one who uses that left-handed 
Kamiya Kasshin Ryu?
[Tenchi]  When I got done talking with the Police yesterday, they told me the 
murderer's name was Hiruma Tetsuo.
*The Hiruma Clan?  The same name as Hiruma Gohei? I wondered if that man or his 
generation changed their attitude towards the Kamiya family?  Something is not 
right here, thinks Kenshin.
Tenchi and Sasami look at Kenshin with confusion.  "What is this man thinking 
about what had happened yesterday?"
As they got to the forest training area Katsuhito starts training Tenchi with 
his kenjutsu.  However Kenshin looks at them train, is starting to feel 
nostalgic.  He remembers the river on Hiko's Mount:
[Hiko Seijuro]  Come, use your sword quickly.
Kenshin makes an attempt and charges after Hiko Seijuro, however Hiko deflects 
his attack and Kenshin backs off and falls into the river. "Even with the 
teachings of Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu...  The Mitsurugi sword or the sword wielded 
for the world to protect the weak." Kenshin said to himself, as he feels the 
scar on his left cheek.  Sasami is looking at him with concern.
Kenshin also remembers the Kihei-Tai training grounds as he hears over Katsura 
Kogoro and Tagasugi.  The warriors are training with dummies to stregenthen 
their attacks.
[Katsura Kogoro] Kihei-Tai?
[Tagasugi] This will be quite a fighting force.  Surely they will succeed.  They 
show promise.  These men are about to bring down Bakufu.
[Katsura] Perhaps they're better than Samurai, but are they capable?
[Tagasugi]  You worry too much. [Man] NEXT!
[Katsura] Are they similar children?
Kenshin prepares himself for the battoujutsu stance.
[Tagasugi] The 'ki' in Kihei means lineage.
Kenshin swings his sword at the dummy, slicing  it in half. After a second it 
falls to the ground.
[Men] Whoa.
[Tagasugi] It may not be that bad.
[Katsura] Tagasugi...
[Tagasugi] What is it? Your eyes are so wide.
[Katsura] He must come to Kyoto.
Kenshin walks up to a tree, and prepares to go into the battoujutsu stance.  
Sasami, Ryoko, and Ryo-Ohki back off when they see Kenshin in his stance.
[Sasami] Ken-niichan?
Tenchi, and Katsuhito stop their training, to look at Kenshin.  Kenshin makes 
the swing with his sakabatou, and slices the tree clean in half, and the tree 
falls to the left.
*This is Himura Battousai all right I hope I can see some of his skills when he 
chooses to fight me.  I want to test his skill to compare it to mine.  I hope he 
is equal to me, thinks Katsuhito.
[Katsuhito] Tenchi, your kenjutsu training is over for today.
Tenchi ponders, "What is jii-chan thinking right now, to stop in the middle of 
training?"
Katsuhito walks up to Kenshin and taps him on the shoulder.
[Kenshin] (confused)  Oro?  Gomen, gomen, I'm just feeling a bit nostalgic right 
now.
[Katsuhito]  Himura-san, will you walk with me to the shrine? I might have some 
information for you if you are interested.
Kenshin ponders if he should go, since he is interested on where he is, he 
chooses to agree with Katsuhito.
[Kenshin] I will walk with you, that I will.
Katsuhito, and Kenshin walk side by side to the shrine, as the rest follow 
behind, as they reached near their destination, there lies a long road big 
enough to do a battle, on the grounds of the shrine.
[Katsuhito]  I see that you are quite trained with your sword.  Who taught you 
this style that you use, and what is the Ryu that you have learned?
[Kenshin] My kenjutsu style is Hiten Mitsurugi-Ryu, and I have learned this from 
my seisho, Hiko Seijuro.  It is a style used for war by samurai and hitokiris, 
however I have used it to protect the people who are weak.
[Katsuhito] Well then, I have a request for you.  Only will I then give you the 
information that you want.
[Kenshin] What is your request, that it is?
{Aku No San}
The Tenchi group is starting to think, "What's going on here?"  Katsuhito draws 
out his bokken.
[Katsuhito] Will you give this old man a warm-up match?  Do not treat me 
lightly, for this is a duel, and I am challenging you.
Kenshin looks at Katsuhito with his manslayer eyes, and unsheathes his 
sakabatou.
[Kenshin] Oh, how I crave for peace, but since you want a challenge, I will give 
you one.  I will fight with this, my sakabatou named "Shin-Uchi" made by the 
greatest satsujin-ken maker in Japan.  However this ken does not kill human 
life, but it is merciless towards materialistic things, that it will.
[Sasami] Tenchi-niichan what is a satsujin-ken?
[Tenchi] (shocked) A sword made to kill.  Do you see Sasami-chan, the blade on 
his sword is reversed, so he cannot kill anyone with it.
[Katsuhito] I see what you mean Himura-san, the blade is reversed, however it is 
slow.
[Kenshin] Come, if you want to fight me.
[Katsuhito]  KYYYAAAA!
{Battousai Theme}
Katsuhito charges after Kenshin and swings his bokken at him, however Kenshin 
blocks it with his sakabatou, and Kenshin swings his sakabatou at Katsuhito, and 
he blocks it, however when he did Kenshin disappeared so fast that Katsuhito was 
not able so see him from behind, Kenshin makes a swing to his side, and 
Katsuhito was able to block it.
[Sasami] Kenshin is fast! However jii-chan is able to block his moves.
Kenshin moved as lightning and ran a few feet away from him, and faces him 
again.  Kenshin sheathes his sword and goes into the battoujutsu stance.
[Kenshin] You are skilled with your sword as well.  Do you think it's time for 
the climax?
[Katsuhito] My, I have not seen someone with that fighting spirit in a long 
time.  I respect you for your code. Yes it is time for the climax.
Tenchi and Sasami ponder who would conclude the battle.
[Sasami]  Let's make a bet on who will win this one, Tenchi-niichan.  The one 
who loses this one will be the one to cook dinner today.
[Tenchi] Sounds reasonable for the stakes.  I bet on Kenshin.
[Sasami]  I'll bet on Jii-chan then.
Katsuhito goes into his fighting position.  All of the sudden they pause the 
battle in their positions.
[Sasami] What are they doing?  They are not doing anything.
[Tenchi] They are sizing up each other, however the battle will end quickly, 
it's a matter of when.
A long pause stands forever, As Kenshin with his manslayer eyes look at 
Katsuhito, and Katsuhito with his grin.  Suddenly Katsuhito charges at Kenshin, 
and so does Kenshin with Katsuhito.  Suddenly with his left foot goes in the 
way, he unsheathes his sword.
[Kenshin] HITEN MITSURUGI AMA KAKAERU RYU NO HIRAMEKI!
Kenshin swings his sword up, however Katsuhito was able to deflect it, but 
didn't get a chance to hit Kenshin.  Both are at opposite directions now, and 
Kenshin sheathes his blade.
{Kyoto E No Purodda}
[Kenshin] It's time to stop this duel, for I choose not to get carried away, 
second of all look at your bokken, you will not be able to use it again, that 
you won't.  I will not oppress people that are not able to defend themselves.
[Katsuhito] Oh?
Katsuhito looks at his bokken, he may think that it is ok, however when he sees 
it, the bokken is cut in half and one piece falls to the ground. Katsuhito 
begins to walk up to Kenshin.
[Katsuhito]  This is a decisive victory for you Kenshin, just as I expected from 
you, Himura Battousai-kun.
Kenshin is shocked and faces Katsuhito.
[Kenshin] Who are you to be calling my other name?
Kenshin walks closer to Katsuhito.
[Katsuhito] The great Himura Battousai, Hitokiri for the Ishin Shishi, for the 
Choshu-han forces.  The man that slew many men of the Bakumatsu and the Meiji 
revolution, I had great admiration for you since you had saved me in Kyoto.
[Tenchi] This is HIMURA BATTOUSAI, The other story that you told me when I was a 
child, other than the samurai that fought the demon on a flying object?  Is this 
really him?!?
[Katsuhito]  Yes, Tenchi.  This is the one that I had told you about.  Himura-
kun, will you come with me to my office?
Katsuhito opens up the door to his office, Kenshin and Katsuhito enter the 
office, and the others followed him.
[Katsuhito]  I am Katsuhito Masaki, Himura Kenshin.  Have a seat while I get 
some sake for the both of us.
Katsuhito gets the sake and two cups and sits down face to face with Kenshin.
[Katsuhito] Let me tell you more about me.  I was in the same squad as you, a 
young man with a sword.  When the Shinsen Gumi tried to set fire in Kyoto, they 
also had a cannon with them as well.  As one of the Mibu bastards fired at us 
while we were fighting the Shinsen Gumi, one of the sakuretsu balls exploded 
nearby us, shrapnel flew everywhere grazing injuries to my comrades, and I some 
even dying from the blood loss from their war wounds.  We had no choice but to 
run away from them, as we hot- footed side by side, they had caught up to us and 
we were surrounded.  I was the one that had said, "Damn, we're not going to make 
it."  However you were hiding in the shadows and had said, "I'll take care of 
them."  Because of you, we were able to find shelter to have our wounds treated, 
while you killed off nearly every Shinsen Gumi bastard in the area. That is why 
I had said I had admiration of you.
Kenshin takes a drink of his sake and gets some more to put in his cup, as he 
remembers the night that they had set Kyoto ablaze.
[Kenshin]  However there were two that I was not able to kill in that battle.  
Shinsen Gumi first division captain Okita Souji, however he had died of 
tuberculosis.  However the other one managed to escape the war and lived through 
the Meiji era.  I had a run-in on him once while I was staying at a dojo and was 
a wanderer in the 11th year of Meiji, May.  The man managed to get in the Meiji 
Government as a police officer under the name of Fujita Goro.
Kenshin remembers that night when he came back from that battle.
[Saitoh] Aku-Soku-Zan.  The Shinsen Gumi had respect for the Hitokiri Battousai, 
however when you chose to live the peaceful life as a Rurouni, you have become 
weak.  Your pacifism makes me sick!
[Kenshin] Shinsen Gumi's third division captain, Saitoh Hajime.
[Katsuhito]  Unfortunately, I am sorry that I have to burst your bubble about 
the Meiji era; we are not living in it.  It has been one hundred and forty years 
past it since I had last seen you. The year is 2001.
{Fallen Angel}
Kenshin's eyes start turning narrow as he heard that.  He closes his eyes.
[Katsuhito]  How did you get here?
[Kenshin]  I was fighting against an evil man to protect the nation, five miles 
from Tokyo.  In an evil castle I saw him, fought him, and defeated him.  However 
he had still power left and cast a black hole of some sorts under me, and I 
ended up here, and met Tenchi and Sasami under the big tree in the forest.  I 
had a dream ten years in my wandering to repent my sins for the men I had slain 
during the Bakumatsu.  In that dream I saw a samurai on a flying object and a 
demon with rage.  The samurai with his sword defeated the demon by transferring 
three gems that were on her wrists and implanted it in his sword and the demon 
was vanquished.  That was how I knew where I was at the time being.
Ryoko thinks, "That was me...  Who is this man, who was able to recall the 
entire memory clearly?"  Ryoko looks at the Tenchi-Ken around Tenchi's belt.
Katsuhito thinks the same thing.
[Katsuhito] Gomen nasai, for what I had done to you earlier.
[Kenshin] Excuse me, but I have to be on my way.  Thank you for your 
information, Katsuhito-san.
Kenshin gets up and leaves the office.
[Tenchi] This is bad news jii-chan. Not only he has no place to go, he has no 
one to see for they have all died over the years.  I am thankful that he had 
saved me from that man in the forest yesterday.  At least there is something I 
can do for him, isn't there?
[Katsuhito]  I looked at his eyes when I told him that Tenchi.  Kenshin is in a 
very dangerous mood right now.  Doing so may cost you your life if you were to 
interfere.
[Sasami] No, I don't want him to leave.  I will do my best to try to make him 
feel at home here.
Sasami starts tearing up.
[Sasami] Don't become a Rurouni again.
Sasami remembers that one phrase "A Rurouni never knows where he goes"
Sasami runs out of the office, and the rest follow after Sasami.
Kenshin is walking back in the forest back to the Tree where he was first found, 
however everyone else except for Ryo-ohki went back to The Masaki Household for 
she had smelled his scent, and was hopping in the forest.
Back at the Masaki Household:
The gang had finally reached the house.  They don't see Kenshin around.
[Sasami] Onee-sama Onee-sama!
Aeka comes out of the door
[Aeka] What is it Onee-chan?
[Sasami] have you seen Kenshin around here? Is he inside the house?
[Aeka] No, he has not been here, what's going on?
[Tenchi] He left.  We had found out that he is not even from this era.  He was 
used to being in the Meiji era, where he was involved in a war.
*No wonder why that man was out of place here, but he was very friendly to us 
all.
[Aeka] Let me come with you.
[Ryoko]  I know where he is.  Ryo-ohki probably tracked him in the forest, where 
Funaho is.
[Tenchi] That's where we found him in the first place.  Lets all go there.  We 
all need to cheer him up there to make him feel welcome here.
{Himura Kenshin}
The entire gang including Katsuhito left to head for the forest, meanwhile 
Kenshin is sitting back with his sword on his shoulder.  He is remembering all 
the memories that he had while at the Kamiya Dojo.  He is Remembering Kaoru, 
Yahiko, Sanosuke, and the rest of the people that he had protected and helped 
over the year while he was staying.  He probably knows that he will not live to 
see the Meiji era again. Suddenly Ryo-ohki Comes up to him.
[Ryo-ohki] Miya.
Kenshin looks at Ryo-Ohki, but he puts his head back down again.  Ryo-Ohki jumps 
on his lap again.  A tear comes out of his eye, as it his palm Ryo-Ohki starts 
licking it up.  A few minutes later the group finds Kenshin under the tree where 
he was before, when Tenchi and Sasami first saw him.
[Group] Kenshin?
Kenshin looks up at them.
[Kenshin] ...
[Katsuhito] We're sorry that this had happened to you.  We would like for you to 
come and stay with us until you find your answer here.
[Tenchi] I forgot to express my gratitude when you saved me from that Hiruma 
guy.  Please come stay with us, we are begging you.
[Aeka]  I liked your cooking.  If one of us gets sick is unable to help out, we 
would like you to give us a hand.
[Ryoko]  I liked how you were able to fight.  You would make an excellent 
protector for us.
{Kaoru's Love theme}
[Sasami] (sparkling eyes) Please don't leave us.  We know that you are not from 
this era; therefore we want to help you.  Please don't wander off.
Kenshin's eyes start widening, as he hears the compliments his spirit comes back 
to him.
[Kenshin] Are you sure you want me here?
[Group] yes.
[Kenshin] If you so desire that I be here, then I shall be here for all your 
sakes, which I can do.
A joyful smile comes on Sasami's face; she runs up to Kenshin and hugs him.
[Sasami] I'm so happy.
[Kenshin] Come to think of it, I hadn't eaten anything since this morning.
[Sasami] I lost the bet when you got jii-chan, but I can't think of anything to 
cook today.  Will you decide for me?
[Kenshin] (confused) Oro?
Kenshin remembers something from his past.  The Akabeko, the best place for 
sukiyaki, where he had the Kenshin Gumi splurge at times.  He remembers Sano and 
his big debt there.
[Kenshin] SUKIYAKI?
[Sasami] That's my favorite. Come, lets all go back home. I'll start the 
splurge.
[Group] Sukiyaki Sukiyaki Party Party.
[Ryoko] I'll get the sake.
[Tenchi] (sweat drop forms) Oh, brother.
As all of them head back for the house, Ryoko got a few bottles of sake, Sasami 
starts cooking the dinner, and after an hour or so, the dinner is ready.
[All] Idekimasu!
Everyone starts eating, however Kenshin for the first time in a while, starts 
pigging out.
[Ryoko] Man, look at him eat.  More than Aeka can handle.
[Kenshin] What would you expect?  I move around a lot.
The group starts laughing.  Ryoko starts drinking the sake, suddenly she offers 
some to Tenchi.
[Ryoko]  Tenchi, do you want some sake?
[Tenchi] I'm underage Ryoko.
[Kenshin] I'll take some.
[Ryoko] Ahh, a fellow sake drinker eh?
Ryoko Passes the bottle, and Kenshin chugs the entire bottle of sake until it 
becomes empty.
[Ryoko] Whoa, I guess I might lose this little duel of mine.
[Group] Hey, Kenshin. How old are you exactly?
Kenshin starts counting his fingers.
[Kenshin] I guess I'm around the late 20's early 30's probably 28.  But since 
I'm here I guess I could say with the time passing by, 168.  Don't worry Ryoko, 
I had more competition than you.
They all look at Kenshin with awe.
[Katsuhito] I guess you served your sword when you were young, probably 13.
[Tenchi and Sasami] You were that young when you mastered your kenjutsu?
[Kenshin] Not mastered, learned.  I was foolish to leave my master to protect 
the world, however my intentions were pure.  I did not master it until fifteen 
years later, which I did.  Normally with this ancient style, the master had to 
die while teaching the disciple the succession, the one I used on Katsuhito, but 
I had used my sakabatou against him. That is what Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu is.  If 
you are asking me to teach it to you Tenchi, I cannot.  You have your own 
master, and you should learn from him.  Grow strong in it, and protect the ones 
you love, that are what bestows true honor to your name, that it will.
[Katsuhito and Ryoko] Very poetic.
[Ryo-Ohki] Myaaa!
Ryo-Ohki jumps on Kenshin's head.
[Kenshin] (smiling) Hi, Ryo-Ohki-chan.  I wonder if I can get used to this 
lifestyle.
[Tenchi] What do you mean you wonder?
[Kenshin] Back then Tenchi all we had were fresh gardens, we had to go to the 
next town to get tofu, and Had to face police swordsmen for breaking the Meiji 
sword law.
Ryoko Disappears and Hugs Tenchi from behind.
[Ryoko] Tenchi, Will you protect me?
[Aeka] Get your hands off Tenchi-sama!
[Tenchi] Not again. (sighs)
[Kenshin] Oro?
They all laugh the entire night off.
Authors Note:
Sorry if I had misspelled in certain places in my last Fanfic, and probably in 
this one too. Certain parts to this are true to some point, however my basic 
thing is inspiration to make good fanfics.
