Super Tenchi Mario - Part 7: The End
Time for the conclusions, my favorite Tenchi writing partners and fans!

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the characters from Tenchi Muyo or Super
Mario. Just remember that.

Tenchi's special selection girl was not the huge expectation Sakuya.
Instead, it was Ayeka!

Mario got married with Peach.

Looks like everyone ends up being friends, and there are rarely any fights.
In fact, that only occurs about one-tenth of the time now!

THE END
