~The dream our planet once had~

A large stone elevator was going upwards.Â  3 people were aboard it, 2 girls

and 1 boy.Â  As it reached the top, they all got out.Â  â€œWell. Its about
bloody
time we reached â€˜ere, donâ€™t you say?â€ said one of the girls, blue hair
and
gold eyes.Â  The other girl replied.â€œIts finally time, come on Tenchi!
Lets
move!â€ she said. This girl had long red hair, which was very spiky and
almost
grazed the floor.Â  The boy came out. â€œLets goâ€ he replied tothem both.

~Defeated the darkness and broughtforth a brighter future~

They ran forward, fighting off everyone in their path until they reached a
strange stone in the floor.Â  They all stood on it, wondering what it was.Â

They suddenly shot upward into the sky, landing on a stone just like
it.Â â€œWhat in the name ofâ€¦it feels like we just went through the
floor!â€ said
the gold-eyed girl.Â  The red-haired girl also said, â€œWhat the heck are we

doing so high? Are we hovering?â€ They walked forward to a huge wooden door

and stopped in front of it.

~However, it was also the dawn of anightmare~

Suddenly, Tenchi lost all of what was there and a new vision was in front of

him. He was on the circular stone again, still in the fortress, a weapon
with
huge blades on either side in his hand. (If you have played or seen Chrono
Cross, you know what I am talkingabout.)Â  For some reason, he smirked as
one
of the girls lay on the ground, mortally wounded as blood dripped off ofthe
blade in his hand.Â  â€œT-T-Tenâ€¦chiâ€¦â€the girl said with the last
energy in her
body. Her head dropped limply.

~A final battle over the legendarytreasure, â€œThe Frozen Flameâ€

â€œTenchiâ€¦Tenchi? TENCHI! GET UP!â€yelled someone.Â  He sat up in bed,
noticing
it was all a dream.Â  â€œDidnâ€™t you have a meet with that girl Ayeka
today? She
will kill you, I mean it!â€ said the voice again.Â  He opened his blinds
tosee
a beautiful ocean view.Â  He breathed in the sea mist, knowing he was in
heaven.Â He was wearing blue jean shorts, orange gloves, and a black T-shirt

with a steel mesh vest over it.Â  He ran out the door. Around him was a very

small seaside village, not many people in it.

~A battle between creatures,humans, and FATE~

He ran toward the pier as a young lady stood there.Â  She had long purple
hair
and purple eyes.Â  3 children were swimming in the water ahead of her. â€œOh

there you are!â€ she yelled. â€œIâ€™m sorry Ayeka, I slept too late!â€ he
replied.Â â€œNow I have to watch over my siblings all dayâ€¦could you do me
a
favor?â€she asked.Â  â€œYes, what is it?â€ he replied.Â  â€œI need some
Komodo
Scales formy necklace. Could you get some for me?â€ she asked, a look of
hers
in her eyesthat meant â€˜pleeeease?â€™ Komodo Scales were popular among the
girls. â€œSure I guess, ill meet you at the beach nearby, ok?â€he
replied.Â
â€œSounds great! Ill meet you there!â€ she said as he ran off in search of
some
Komodo Scales.Â

~That will surpass even space andtimeâ€¦~

About 2 hours later, he was on the beach, waiting for Ayeka. She came to the

beach and walked over to him. Hehanded her some beautiful scales as she
beamed happily.Â  â€œItâ€™s been a while since weâ€™ve last been here.Â  I
just hope
these times would never end.Â  Dou you remember when we were kids? We had no

cares at all, just the sea coming back and forth, as it will probably for
eternity.â€ She said, a faraway look in her eyes.Â  Suddenly, Tenchi lost
all
that was there again.Â  Mists of blue and green energy came up around him
and
a black hole was beneath him.Â  It ended and he fell to his knees, passed
out.

~Our planetâ€™s dream has not yetendedâ€¦~

Tenchi awoke to find a deserted beach.Â  He quickly rose to his feet and ran

back to the village.Â  As he went to the pier, he saw Ayeka still there.Â
As
he walked over, he spoke to her. â€œIâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t know
you.Â
Butâ€¦you do look like the boy who used to live next to me.â€ She said.Â
â€œWhat
was his name?â€ he asked.Â  â€œHis nameâ€¦wasâ€¦Tenchiâ€¦â€ she said.
â€œBUT IM
TENCHI!â€ he said with haste, knowing something was wrong. â€œDonâ€™t say
that!
Itâ€™s disrespectful! Tenchi died at the age of 7 as he drowned in the
sea.Â
You should visit his graveâ€¦it would make him happyâ€¦â€ she said sadly.
