Chapter 4--- Three White Flowers

Disclaimer: (Okay, You know the drill)
Tenchi Muyo and the gang are owned by AIC and Pioneer, and the respected
masters in the Japanese realm. Star trek Deep Space Nine is owned by the
Paramount Studios and respectively Rick Bergman and Mike Pillar.  We
write for fun. We are
just two kids fooling around so don't sue us. We don't got the money.

Rebb01 (VO): Last time-in the crossover between Tenchi Muyo and Deep
Space Nine…

Somewhere in the vastness of space, something was moving very fast. It
left a wake in the vacuum of space. Water like and with great speed it
moved quickly to its destination.  A bright flash of crimson opened a
blossom in front of the very stunned creature. He tried to veer. The
gravity well however overcame him. He let a surprised shriek out as the
crimson blossom closed again.
Then he found himself heading up or down in a rock tunnel.

"He has come!"

"Who are you? Why Have you brought me here?"

"You have been chosen to help us."

"Why the hell should I?"

"You thrive where there is no…. Jurai energy. We can lead you to a
place
where it never existed."

"What do I have to do?"
*               *               *               *               *
*               *               *

Kieko felt her head start to spin, and only thought about her children.
The
runabout kept turning, flipping end over end. The pilot hit a few
buttons and righted the craft.
"What the--! We just got buzzed by .. SOMETHING!"
*               *               *               *               *
*               *               *
        "Mr. Odo!" Sasami blurted out. Odo felt the floor abruptly meet his
face as he fell. Tenchi raced towards him.
"Are you all right?" The boy asked.
Odo  moved to a sitting position. It had felt like the whole floor had
suddenly moved under his feet, violently. He had a gag in his mouth. Do
Changelings Throw up?
Tenchi started to call for help. Ryo-Oki picked up Odo's arm and rubbed
her cheek into his side.

        Rebb01 (Noting the growling look on the face of his partner): Uh,
here'schapterfourof "If Wishes Were Cabbits"

***************************************************************************

Kira looked puzzled, staring at the readout for a very strange ship.
Sisko had called most of his Senior staff to the conference room. The
only people that hadn't shown up yet were Dax, Worf, And Odo.
But then they were also waiting for their 'guests'.
Odo and Tenchi entered with the two younger girls in tow. The constable
was carrying Ryo-Oki; she giggled as she held to him. Odo held the side
of his head.
Kira tilted her head towards him in a smile, then she noticed his
expression.
When he released the girl, she hugged him around the leg. Dax let a
chuckle escape. Odo started, now looking quite puzzled.
"Meow," Ryo-Oki purred.
"It seems she likes you, Constable," Sisko spoke up.
Now embarrassed, Odo pulled in his surprise.  "It seems so, Captain," he
answered calmly. He then slid his hands in-between the little girl's.
She looked up.
He got down to her level. "You aren't supposed to do that," he sternly
scolded.
Ryo-Oki now looked puzzled, then ready to cry. "Meow?" she asked.
"You surprise people doing that," he backpedaled quickly. Kira felt
impressed. "That don't like it, Okay?"
Ryo-Oki finally returned to her sunny grin. Then Tenchi signaled for her
to go play.

Sisko suddenly felt his head ache, and heard a whispering voice.

Ayeka felt the wall come in contact with her shoulder. Ooh!
Ryoko stopped moving, and floated in mid-air. "Hey, you Okay, princess?"

Miles waited nervously at the airlock. Kieko hurried over to him, about
dragging Molly behind her. She had been so frightened, like she was
sensing something dreadful.

Ben felt constricted. Something was pounding at his temples. Then he saw
the wormhole turn white, not blue as it would normal do if a ship came
through. A pattern of three odd-shaped ovals, like vacant eyes pressed
along his own. One in the center was quite red, the others dark as a
dead soul. The face was white like death…
And he was afraid.
Then he saw the human boy…Tenchi. He held his sword. But he had not seen
the boy carry a sword, not one like this…
"Captain?" someone asked.

Ben shook his head. Odo and Tenchi were both looking at him very close.
"Are you all right, Captain?" Odo asked.
Sisko rubbed at his temples.

Mihoshi jumped at sound of her wrist communicator beeping. Washu
stopped, and whipped around. What had caused it to go off again?
"Oh dear, oh dear!" Mihoshi panicked. "Why is it responding, now?"
Then Washu about fell on the floor. Something had caused her to tip, in
nausea. She turned several shades green.
"Damn gyration sickness," she muttered. Then she wondered why this was
the first time she had ever had felt like this.

Too many coincidences.

Tenchi watched as Bashir helped Captain Sisko. Something odd had just
happened.

The entity paused as it felt the par-wraith settled in. It had to adjust
as did he to the… backseat driver. But then it did not feel as such.
Both were becoming one.

#########################################################################

The meeting went on. Ben seemed distracted. Dax noticed that he tapped
his hand on the table. Why was he doing that?
Pattern of three. Break. Pattern of three. Break. And the cycle was
repeating.
Lady Ayeka spoke eloquently. But then she was a princess.  Dax really
couldn't care less, but then she listened to Washu's talk. The theory
that the young woman had on the wormhole was pretty close to what they
had reasoned a while back, but she had added that she had figured that
there were 'slips' in the wormhole structure. Bajor may have been the
main focus of the entities called the Prophets, but that doesn't mean
that the 'temple' may not  have had a back entrance.
Major Kira scowled. Bajorans wouldn't like to hear that! The Prophets
are gods to the Bajorans; this foreign scientist had no idea…
But then looks were quite deceiving…

Odo gave a quiet stare over to the little girl. Ryo-Oki giggled, then
miyaed , as he started to call her word structure. Somehow the universal
translator wasn't working on her. But then she might just be so little
that these were just cries, like a human infant. Sasami giggled in a
little girl secret. Odo tried to smile. He remembered that it had taken
him a while to learn to talk as well.
Washu was starting to bore him.
He glanced over to Ryoko. She rolled her eyes to the ceiling. Then he
saw her mutter…
He had learned to read lips, to understand any shady character on a
surveillance tape. Her lips were making out… "…could you just shut up,
Mom…"
Mom? Miss Washu? The girl looked hardly over twelve! And Ryoko was quite
a young woman…definitely older than twelve.
Odo tilted his head back to the redhead. This time he listened with a
little more interest. But he was thinking of something else.
Ben kept tapping…

When the meeting adjourned, Dax and Washu walked off together, still
talking theory.
Ryoko was getting fed up. Then she overheard, the both of them starting
to talk about, organics and genetics… and Washu was leading the
conversation. The more Ryoko listened, the more she realized Washu was
mentioning towards Ryoko's creation. But she was politely keeping it
from being mentioned. Offffph!
Odo lightly tapped Sasami's shoulder. He started to ask a question.
Sisko started to talk to Worf about any threat that the station would
have to contend with…
"MOTHER!!!!!" Ryoko protested. The crew halted immediately.
Washu was very surprised at first, then turned an odd look to Ryoko.
"Yes, dear?" she asked.
Ryoko looked at the other's surprised faces. She gained a sweatdrop.
"Um, tell you later…"
Odo finally got that smile loose.

Bashir rather openly stared. He surely thought that Washu was a sister
to somebody, not a mother to the older looking Ryoko. These people were
becoming quite surprising.

##################################################

        The entity was becoming impatient. But another par-wraith halted the
pair.

        "There is a problem-they had let another group through the temple!"

"This means nothing. They let finites through the passage frequently,
now."

"But-I felt a great power within this group. And they have warned their
emissary!"

"So they know we are coming… This WILL  be nothing!"

The entity began to wonder. A finite with great power?

"So we will have to deal with them as well." The par-wraith culled to
the mind.

        Ben found Jake waiting for him near the hall. He smiled, then patted
his son on the shoulder. Tenchi looked wistfully at the two men, one the
senior, the other the son.
"Jake, this is Tenchi Masaki, part of the Jurai delegation. Maybe an
interview would be nice for a later reference to your instructor--,"
Jake smiled, and laughed. Then he looked to the girls. Sure, Dad---
Jake introduced himself to Tenchi. They got talking about things they
had in common.
Tenchi was glad to finally have a normal guy to talk to, ever since
dealing with Ryoko and the others. Sure, he had his school friends, but
he worried the others would pull something that he couldn't explain he
way out of. Jake even liked sports-baseball especially.
Tenchi asked if they could play a game sometime while they were here.

If they had the time.

In their quarters, Sasami and Ryo-Oki began to bounce on the bed. Ayeka
started to scold them.
"Oh, let them have their fun," Ryoko called. She looked at herself in
the large mirror in the bathroom.
"And who are you to say!" Ayeka growled back.

Washu pulled her holo-computer up, called up her sensory data and
tabulated it against the local findings on the wormhole. But then she
got to reading the information on the 'myth' of the Prophets and the
Celestial Temple. Much of it was from Bajor, and they had apparently the
locals had made them gods. She shrugged.
Sisko has now been called their Emissary. That seemed so funny to her.
She couldn't see the big captain a messager from  the so obscure beings.
But these 'Prophets'…

############

The entity felt ready, yet the par-wraith held back. Was it checking
something?
What was this about? Then he felt the seething rage these beings felt.
It filled him. He had been a criminal, yes, but this was vicious, an all
consuming rage. He knew it. He would always know it.

*               *               *               *               *
*               *

Andrew: Khoo! Getting vicious.. aren't we?

REBB01: Not really, consider who we're dealing with.

Glyph: Don't give it away guys!

Then a voice called. Pathos: Dinner! Hungry! Come…

Glyph: Let's eat… Oh, and to you folks, send any info, responses or
boxes of frosted O's to the E-mail:
