~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rubian walks in to a forest like any other day to pick some berries. His basket seems
pretty empty and he couldn't seem to find any berries. He hears two people talking/
shouting further west of the forest. When he finally gets out of the forest he sees 2
people fighting.

Rubian: Konnichi Wa!
Cid: Get out of here if you don't want to be hurt!
Rubian: No, no, no, you have it all wrong...
Alanna: You heard him, get out of here, we are fighting. If you don't want to get hurt
	get lost!

Alanna, distracted, allows Cid to land a punch to her face. 

Rubian: Err... ok, but do you mind if I can have some berries? For some reason, I
	couldn't find any in the forest today and my wife would get mad and...
Cid: I TOLD YOU THE FIRST TIME TO GET OUT OF HERE! NOW GET OUT OF HERE!!

Cid knocks Rubian back into a tree. Rubian gets back up and shakes off the after effect
of that impact. 

Rubian: ...Look, I'm just asking for some berries...

Cid kicks Rubian sending him flying back towards the tree again. 

Cid: Well, I gave you your chance to leave unharmed, and since you aren't willing to
	leave, I will kill you, then get rid of the girl.
Rubian: ....

Cid fires several rocket fast punches at Rubian but are all dodged. Rubian kicks Cid in
the stomach before kicking his head and doing a frontflip, knocking Cid down.

Rubian: I wasnt looking for a fight in the beginning but since you are asking for one,
	you have one. 

Cid attempts to use a special technique but Rubian lands his own special technique on
him, punching him in 9 vital spots on the body in godspeed knocking Cid. 

Alanna: [stratches head] Thanks for the help kid.

Alanna kicks Cid square in the nuts while he is grasping for life on the ground.

Rubian: No problem ^^.

He walks off in the forest to look for more berries since no one here has any berries to
give him. He stares at the sun and the shadow of one of the sundials he have placed in
many locations of the forest.

Rubian: Oh dear... I better hurry up. Misao (yes, the one from RK) is not going to be
	happy.

--Shortly after Rubian takes off...--

Cid: You should know...making a Saiya-jin angry is not a smart thing!!!!

He yells, and powers up, his eyes glazed over with hate

Cid: You will pay for that!!!

As he takes a fighting stance, not aware of any pain from the past, Cid's power level
rapidly increases, as if without limit.

Cid: Alanna, I am not done with you....after I kill you, that boy is next!!!!

He lets out another power up yell and lightning strikes the earth furiously, barely
missing X and Alanna.

Cid: Aaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!

By this time, Cid's aura had tripled in size, and he glares over at Alanna with cold
blue eyes, holds his hands out in front of him and charges up a Ki blast.

Cid: FINAL FLASH!!!!!!

Just then, he fires a large Ki blast at the fallen X, which appears to hit him and then..

Alanna: No!!!! X!!!!! 

She quickly jumps in the way and takes the brunt of the blast.

Alanna: Aiiiiieeeeeee!!!
Cid: You will suffer!! 

He increases the power of the blast 10 fold, which then leads to an earth shattering
explosion...when the smoke clears, Alanna slowly stands up over the fallen X, her clothes
tattered and torn, with some blood trinkling from her mouth.

Alanna: You....you will pay for this!!
Cid: Die!!

He lets out another yell and his power sharply increases again and the two engage in a
fight, Alanna being hit with more blows than she can dodge

Cid: You are fast..but not fast enough, woman!!!
Alanna: Aaaauuuugh 

She folds over Cid's fist, which has impaled her stomach.

Cid: Your time has come now!! 

He opens his fist inside her stomach, and releases a blast that sends her slamming into
the side of the Masaki home.

Alanna: It's not....over

She slumps over more, almost falling, and staggers getting back up.

Cid: From my point of view...it is.

He clasps his hands behind him, ready to unleash the Kamehameha.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="red">You think it's so easy to beat me?!</font>

Alanna staggers to her feet, and her eyes fade, going completely white. The skys cloud
over, and lightning begins to strike downwards.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="red">You'll find you've seriously underestimated me!</font>

Lightning begins to strike towards Alanna, lancing along her, and coruscating off of her
skin in brilliant sparks. A faint aura appears around her, and slowly grows in power.

Cid: Ka-!

Lightning is now striking Alanna in sheets, instead of single bolts. The energy bleeding
off of her is ionizing the air around her.

Cid: Mee-!

Armor wraps itself around Alanna's left hand and arm. Her eyes turn to a flat black.

Cid: Haa-!

Silvery wings erupt from Alanna's back.

Cid: Mee-!

Her wings flex once, and expand, trailing streamers of cerulean fire. A pulse of energy
emanating from Alanna's aura spreads out from Alanna, and fades as the aura fades to
nothing. A final lightning bolt strikes Alanna, and her eyes change a final time, as
electricity seems to spark constantly through them.

Cid: Haaaa! 

A massive stream of energy erupts from Cid's cupped hands, and heads directly towards
Alanna. Alanna stares calmly at the approaching blast, and just before it strikes, her
wings clap shut in front of her, shielding both her and X. The Kamehameha strikes, and
is deflected harmlessly upwards.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Are you quite done, yet?</font>
Cid: [smirking] Haven't even begun. 

A brilliant energy beam ignites in Alanna's left hand. 

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Very well.</font>

Alanna points at Cid, and a ball of what appears to be liquid fire appears in her hand.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Let the party begin anew.</font>

The ball leaves her hand, and floats toward Cid, gathering speed swiftly. Alanna leaps
to the side, and charges forward, energy blade at the ready.  Instead of waiting for
Alanna to approach, Cid instead opts to strike first, and fades away only to appear in
front of Alanna and attempt to land a hit, only to punch though only an after image.

Cid: Damn, this can not be good.

He turns around, only to be be greeted by Alanna's fist. He goes flying backwards, and
skids across the ground only to back flip up and be kicked to the Earth so hard that i
makes a large crack in the surface where he is.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">You are too sure of yourself, Cid. Don't make this harder on yourself. I know
	you are probably holding back way more than it seems, but I am not stupid enough
	to let you unleash your power.  Instead, I will take you out here and now.</font>

She raises her energy blade, and hurtles down at Cid from on high.

Cid: Uuuh? 

He feels the approaching power, and moves away quickly.  Not fast enough, he recieves a 
rather large gash on his left arm

Cid: Damn you bitch!!!! (She is way too fast...I can't handle her in this form...but for
some reason I can't unlock any of my previous forms...I just don't feel like myself...)
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Bitch? Do I look like a dog to you? If you answer yes, your death will be all
	that much more painful. Tell me why, why did you attack me, what is making you
	do this?</font>
Cid: You wouldn't believe me if I told you, woman.

Alanna fades away and appears in front of Cid, then grabs him by the throat and lifts
him off of the ground with the greatest of ease and glares into him with her cold black
eyes.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">What won't I believe, hmmm? Tell me, and I will spare your life for 30 seconds.</font>
Cid: No!

Wincing, he spits on Alanna's face.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Why you!! That was gross!</font>

She flings Cid into a tree, and it cracks in half, then bends over him as if trapping
him.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">You are mine now!</font>

Cid, in a sudden eruption of power, bursts out, and meets Alanna, trying his best to hit
her with everything he's got, just missing by split seconds, moving so fast that the two
only seem to appear for brief moments, which only seem to be bright flashes and
shockwaves in the sky.

Cid: You will die!!! Understand that!?
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">You wish.</font> [grins] <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">What if I said, I could</font> [still resisting
	Cid's blows] <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">speed up even more, and defeat you like the insect you are?</font>
Cid: You lie...[still punching and kicking, just under Alanna's threshold of speed]
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">No.</font>

She grabs Cid's hands in hers, and clasps them in a mercy stance.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">I could very much kill you right now...and I will...[grins]</font>
Cid: Aahhhhh!

Alanna is slowly crushing Cid's hands.  Suddenly, a girl rushes in from the wilderness
not far off.

Girl:[crying] You stop that right now!! Stop hurting him!!
Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">And who is this? If you wish to live, run now.</font>
Girl: Leave him be!! Please, leave him be. Take me on instead!! I will defeat you in his place!
Cid: No!! Alyssa!! Don't do i-

Cid gets hit square in the gut, then he meets an onslaught of punches and kicks.  He gets
thrown onto the ground, and skids across the ground for about 120 yards before stopping,
blood dripping from his mouth and arm, barely able to stay conscious.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Now, what is this you said? Defeat me?</font>
Alyssa: I know you are stronger than me, maybe a billion times stronger than me, but you
	are hurting my best friend!!! I will not let you hurt him anymore!!

She charges at Alanna, only to have Alanna meet her instead, and hit her in the gut as
well.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Girl, don't be so foolish.</font>
Alyssa: Unggghh...I am not foolish, just protecting someone I don't want to see die!

She shoves Alanna off of herself, and attempts to fight her.

Alanna: <font face="georgia' size=3 color="blue">Hmph, people wish to die so young, these days.</font>

As she says that, she increases her speed, and starts to make quick work of Alyssa.

{What will happen to Cid? Who is Alyssa and how long can she hold out? Will Alanna win
this epic battle? All this and more in the next entry!}

Scene: Black Void
 
Alanna: No...please, no. Don't do this, Tis. 
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] <font face="georgia" color="blue">It has to be done, if you want him to leave you in
	peace. I know you would rather not do these things again, but it must be done.</font>
Alanna: No, it doesn't! We can find another way, Tis! 
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] <font face="georgia" color="blue">He may yet destroy us. Are you willing to take that
	risk?</font>
Alanna: [quiet, emphatic] Yes. I am. 
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] <font face="georgia" color="blue">Very well. On your head be it.</font>

Alanna: [tremulous grin] Our head, Tis. Our head.

Back to the fight:

Alanna has Alyssa by the neck, and is staring emptily into Alyssa's face, watching her
slowly choke to death. Alanna's eyes fade from black to white, and she drops Alyssa like
a rock.

Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Why? Why do you wish to protect him?</font>

Alyssa stares at Alanna, as if hypnotized by the sparkles of electricity dancing across
Alanna's eyes. Cid groans, and tries to get up.

Cid: Alys..Alyssa! Run, now! Please!

Alanna blasts Cid, and he flies backwards, slamming through trees, until he is stopped
by an intervening cliff, and is knocked unconscious.

Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Why?</font>
A.C: Why else? Because of love... 
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Love? I don't know love...</font>
A.C: I know that...
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Where did you come from? Who are you?</font>
A.C: I am the one who will show you what love is...

A.C steps up to Alanna, grabs her in his arms, and kisses her passionately.

X slowly wakes up and assesses the situation.

X: What the New Jersey?
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">X, are you okay?</font>
A.C: Hey, come back here so I can show you what love is!!!
X: I'm fine. I feel kinda dizzy though.
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Maybe you should go inside and rest then.</font>
X: Yeah, good idea. Things don't seem to friendly out here anyway.
Cid: Come on, woman!! Fight me!

Cid begins to power up and then fires off another huge beam of energy. Alanna deflects
it, and it lands in the forest. The sound of someone yelling in pain can be heard all
the way back at the house. 

Kagato: I wonder what that was?
Yosho: It sounded like Rubian getting hit by some kind of energy beam.
Ryoko: Hey hey! Less talkin', more drinkin! 

--Meanwhile, out by the lake...--

X: Oh man, why can't we just relax and enjoy ourselves until we leave for battle?
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">X, watch out!</font>
X: Yeah, I see it. 

X and Alanna dodge Cid's next volley of energy attacks. 

X: Well, hurry up and take care of him. I'm gonna head back inside. 
Alanna: <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">Sure thing.</font>

Meanwhile, standing by the remains of his gundam, Wufei still wonders who, or what,
Alanna is. 

Wufei: That woman...

--Cid suddenly realizes something.--

Cid: Alyssa!! 

He staggers to his feet, and, limping, runs over to Alyssa, now crumpled on the ground.

Cid: Alyssa....are you ok!? Speak to me!!!

Alyssa's eyes are glazed over, half open, and she is smirking gently

Alyssa: I'm sorry...I couldn't do anything...She had caused more damage to my system
	than the emergency repair system can handle...My vision is fading fast, your
	voice like an echo of a dream...I want you to know...even though you know what
	she is gonna do, how she will turn out, even if she shows compassion *cough* you
	can't give up...fight with your heart...just let it all out...You have no need
	to restrain yourself, it is my last wish, that you please...please go on...I
	will always remember...you...even..in...death....[her eyes slowly close, for the
	last time]

Cid: Alyssa!!! Alyssa!! Noooo!!! Alyssa!! Don't die...don't die on me...

His eyes stream with tears over the fresh loss of his reploid partner

Cid: You never did anything wrong...I won't let this happen again...she is too unstable
	...Alyssa...noo [unable to control anger] Why did this have to happen!! You
	should have stayed behind!!
Alyssa: [last of her breath] It's ok...I wanted to protect you...now just do the same
	for me...make sure this..never....h a p p e n s... a g a i n...........
Cid: Noooooo!...don't go!!!!!!...don't go.....ALANNA!!!...you will pay...

Cid uses the last of his energy to use instant transmission, appearing in front of X and
Alanna.

Cid: You...you took her away...she was the only thing I had left!! [tears stream down his
	face] You showed no compassion...You just let out a brutal onslaught..no more...
	NO MORE!!!!

Suddenly, the wind picks up, and the skys once again become restless, as crystaline
lighting begins to crash unto the earth, causing lava to spew from open holes.

Cid: I won't let you do this again...not to anyone else...

Cid's hair flares up, and his body mass shrinks some, back into a regular SSJ mode, but
his power level starts to increase astronimically.

Cid: My heart is aching....my tears are falling, you with your heartless expression...
	you took all I had when I was younger...you took them all away from me!!! I won't
	let that ever happen again!!!!

As Cid says that, his hair stands up on end, seems to grow about 6 inches, and spikes out
even more, flashing from Golden Blonde to a Platinum Silver color every other moment, his 
eyes going from green to an ice blue...and his muscles then expand some, as sliver and
blue lightning cascade up and down his body, about a slowly appearing silvery aura.

Voice:[in Cid's head] It comes with a need...a need to protect those you have, and those
	you lost...let your emotions consume you, and you will find the answer...

Cid: Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!! 

The storm picks up, and the wind blows furiously about the land, lightning raining down
in all directions, threating to strike anything that stands; the wind picks up debris,
and flings it in all directions.  As Cid becomes lost in his emotions, his power level
rises still farther.

Cid: I won't....you took so much....it is your turn...your turn to feel my pain and my
	anguish from the past. Let me unleash it unto you!!!

With one last yell, Cid's hair once again completely changes its color, in unison with
his eyes, and lightning sparks off him, cascadeing around his aura, trying to reach out
to those near, like a snake waiting to strike.  Cid stands silent, and glares at Alanna,
tears still streaming down his face.

Cid: 8 years of loss...all lost because of you... No more.
Alanna:[speechless] <font face="georgia" size=3 color="green">I....I know...what you are talking about... I know... I don't regret
	doing it either, your people were an obstruction to the path I was taking...
	figures there is one left with a grudge against me.</font>

Cid: ...

As the two stand, faced against each other, what has Alanna done to unlock this power in
Cid? Will he be able to defeat her? What is the story behind Alanna and Cid exactly...all
this and more in the next entry...{Camera shoots over to Cid, with a serious look on his
face, eyes narrowed} of Here's the Deal!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cliffhangar!!!!  Don't you just hate it when someone does that?  Oh, in case you're
wondering, there is backstory here, but it's not very important so don't worry about it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The two stand, faced against each other, prepared to battle to the death.  What will
happen?  Find out today, on Here's the Deal!

Alanna: Cid...that was a long time ago. There is still much you do not know. The 
	Saiya-jin race...presented a problem to my master. When...when I destroyed the
	Saiya-jin...I was not myself, you could say. I...was under the control of...
	someone else, much as Ryoko was for much of her life.
Cid: Excuses! 
Alanna: Please! I don't want to kill anymore! I spent five hundred years killing, I don't
	want to do it anymore!
Cid: Yeah? What about her? [indicates Alyssa's body] 
Alanna: I..I'm sorry. It was an accident. The..the battle-fury...still has a grasp on me.
Cid: I don't care! You will pay, for what you have done. 

Scene: The void 

Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] Are you satisfied? There can be no other solution to
	this.
Alanna: [bows head] Very well. But try not to kill him, please? 
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] It will present a difficulty. He may prove to be a
	problem in the future, as his power is not inconsiderable.
Alanna: Please. 
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] Very well.

Scene: the Forest 

Alanna's eyes darken back to their former flat black shade. 

Alanna: [dispassionate] I have already paid more than you can imagine, boy. Leave, now,
	and I will not destroy you.

--Meanwhile, back in the house...--

Ryoko: Say, who is that Alanna person anyway?
Yosho: Well, it is a rather long story. I first met her after she returned to Earth and
	found Thomas de la Lande. After she found him, and killed his entire family, I
	fought with her. I was unable to kill her, and she escaped back to the Soja. It
	was then that Kagato took direct control of her body using advanced nano-
	technology. For the next five hundred years, she was his slave. Then one day,
	Nagi found her, and almost killed her.  Alanna then went into hiding until her
	systems repaired themselves.
Ryoko: Kagato?

Ryoko glances over in Kagato's direction. 

Ryoko: You mean this Kagato? You're the one who did all that to her?
Kagato: No, this was in a different dimention.
Ryoko: Yeah, like I'm gonna fall for that!
Yosho: Ryoko, he is telling the truth.
Ryoko: Oh, okay.
Kagato: More sake?
Ryoko: Sure. 

--Outside, in the forest...--

X: Well, I'm sure you can take care of all this on your own, so I'll just head back
	inside now, okay Alanna?
Alanna: Fine. Come on Cid, what are you waiting for?

X goes back into the house, and heads to Washu's lab. 

Washu: Hey X, what can I do for you?
X: Well, I was wondering if you could help me build something.
Washu: Well, what do you have in mind?
X: Can you bring up the design specs for my gear?
Washu: I see. Is this for her? Well, I'll give you all the help you need.
X: Thanks Washu.

X and Washu get busy altering the design for the Tiamat, but why?

--The fight...--

Cid: I don't care...

Some tears still course down from his eyes, tracing along his cheeks before they fall.

Cid: You took all those that were dear to me, you took them all, and didn't care!!!

Lightning snaps about furiously, just missing Alanna by an inch or so.

Cid: I don't want your apology, I want my friends back, I want my family back! Give them
	back! 
Inner voice: Let the power consume you, give in, and all will be well...
Cid: You...you and your heartlessness, you and your desire to kill...I can not forget
	that, when I was young, I hid in the shadows as I saw you kill my mother...Ever
	since then, my heart hasn't been the same. We are destined to be tied together
	like this, and fated to be where only one of us can walk away...
Alanna: So be it, it is, after all, your funeral.
Cid: I don't care, even if I only cripple you, you will no longer be able to do what you
	have done...ever again...

Magus knelt down on his knees behind the large bush for disguise as he peered out across
the dark plains. Moonlight shone out across the swaying grass, painting a beautiful
picture. Just then, a creature poked its head out over the grass.

Magus: There... 

He crept towards the tall grass in the direction of the animal. Magus parted the grass
and peered through. Just then, a screeching evil sausage jumped through the grass,
attaching itself to Magus's head. 

Magus: Agh, dammit! 

Magus fell to the ground and began prying the demon from his face, but to no avail.
Muffled, Magus chants.

Magus: Nmmfph zmphmpm zmppmnmph zmph, nmph thmph chmmnmphp tmhpphn hanmmph cmmph!

The sausage suddenly burst into flames, and jumped away from Magus, who scrambled to his
feet. Magus then swung his scythe at the sausage, slicing it in half.

Magus: *pant, wheeze* Damn...

Magus looked up at the moon.

Magus: Those sausages are going to pay...

--In Washu's lab--

Washu: X, what's wrong?
X: Well, for a second there I had this strange vision of you and me having freaky sex.
Washu: Oh, well, that's okay. You're not even my type! Now Babobo on the other hand...
X: Washu, can we just finish the designs?
Washu: Okay, okay.
X: How are the repairs to Nataku?
Washu: They're just about finished.
X: Well, that should make Babobo happy. Say, can you bring up the design specs for the
	mega cannon that Tallgeese 3 uses?
Washu: You're really going all-out for this. Any special reason?
X: Hey, don't quesion the maestro while he's busy working.
Washu: Alright. Just let me know if you need any more help, okay?
X: I will. Thanks again Washu.

Rubian pratices his kung-fu outside one day when a mysterious man comes up to him.

Mysterious Man: Come with me.
Rubian: Who are you?
Mysterious Man: No time to explain, just leave a note to Misao saying you're going away
	for a while..
Rubian: Wait, a minute, you have told me who you are yet.
Mysterious Man: That is not important.
Rubian: I'm not moving till you tell me who you are.
Mysterious Man: Alright, alright...

The Mysterious Man takes off his hat, and it turns out it is Chichiri from Fushigi Yugi. 

Rubian: Ah, it's Chichiri-san, how have you been doing?
Chichiri: Fine. There is something I want to show you though. It is very important and
	you must attend right now.
Rubian: Ermm... alright 

Rubian walks off with Chichiri as they walk towards a huge range of mountains. As they
get closer to the mountains he notices it's starting to get darker.

Rubian: Umm... Chichiri-san... Chichiri-san? Chichiri-san, where did you go? Where are
	you, damn it? 

Rubian keeps walking until it is completely dark. 

Rubian: Ok, this is getting strange. I better be heading back now. Misao-chan isnt going
	to be happy.
Chichiri: Hold on one minute.

Chichiri appears standing from a branch.

Rubian: Eh?
Chichiri: You arent leaving this forest alive.
Rubian: WHAT!?

Chichiri starts to generate fire around him and wings form from of his back, horns
sprout, and then his whole skin peels off. 

Demon: I repeat, you aren't going anywhere. By the order of the Emperor, I am to see
	you dead.
Rubian: So you tricked me eh? Nobody tricks me and gets away alive with it.

Rubian punches his two fists together and proceeds to try and beat the crap out of the
demon. He launches several moves at it but it doesnt seem to be affected.

Demon: MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Your weak punches cant harm me! 

The demon blows out a storm of fire attempting to engulf Rubian in the deadly flame.
Rubian jumps away just in time, suffering only minor burns.

Rubian: Ughh... you are pretty damn strong, but if I say I'm going to kill you, I'm going
	to kill you. 

Rubian launches the special technique he used on Cid earlier. Punching the demon in 9
specific locations, he left the demon in a near-death state.

Rubian: [wipes nose] eh heh, I told you not to mess with me.
Demon: You, you haven't seen the last of Emperor Shou and his army. See you in Hell, boy. 

The demon sinks in the ground leaving no remains of its body.

Rubian: Emperor Shou? What would his highness want with a lowly peasant like me... o
	shoot, I forgot. I have to return to Misao-chan soon. 

Rubian runs off back to his home. But a question remains. What is Emperor Shou planning
to do with Rubian? It remains a mystery.

(babobo2's head peeks out from some bushes on the shore of the Pond)

Babobo: Crap, I hope it's safe. That damn girl's gonna get me arrested.
Narrator number 5: Perhaps this is a good time for a flashback.
Babobo: I guess.... 

~Begin Flashback~

Now, five years ago babobo stumbled across a bottle. Now babobo stumbles across many
bottles in the course of a day, he isn't very graceful. Now, opposed to the normal,
usually dirty bottles he stumbled across, this one was special. It contained a genie
(or something, the particulars wheren't really important at the time). This is the
conversation that followed.

Bottle 'genie': For freeing me you get a wish.

Now, babobo is like any man and for a split second thought about world peace and a 
bitching upgrade for El Queso, but these pailed in comparison to what occured to him
next.

Babobo: I want women to find me irresistable.
Bottle 'genie': Granted.

Now, this genie was from back in the day. Back in the day being that period of time when
a woman was at her peak and married by 14, and so Babobo was cursed forever.

~End Flashback~

Babobo: Thank you narrator 5.
Narator 5: I have a name.
Babobo: But nobody cares. 

--The fight between Cid and Alanna--

Alanna: It was not my desire to kill that you saw, but my rage at being forced to kill.
	I cannot give you back your family and friends, all I can do, is grieve with you.
Cid: Grieve? You? Ha! You are a cold, cruel monster! 
Alanna: You think it is so easy, to kill and forget? Every night, in my dreams, I
	remember another face, another person that was ruthlessly slaughtered by me.
	Some days, I cannot even face my own reflection in a mirror.
Cid: I don't CARE! You will die for what you have done!
Alanna: I do not fear death. But there yet remains things I would do. 

Cid attacks, his brilliant aura blurring his motions. He connects with Alanna, sending
her flying up into the air. Her wings snap open, supporting her.

Alanna: Do not force my hand.
Voice in Cid's head: Let the power flow...

Cid lets out a scream of rage, and his aura grows some more. 

Cid: You will pay!

He blasts upwards with incredible speed, and Alanna barely avoids him. He snap rolls
in midair, firing an insanely powerful Ki blast at Alanna. Her wings clap shut in front
of her, and the blast impacts, forcing her downwards, towards the ground. Cid pumps more
power into the blast. Alanna lands, and braces against the ground, her wings straining
to hold back the blast. It explodes, vaporizing an area 40 meters in diameter. Alanna
slowly stands, her wings disheveled and singed.

Alanna: I do not wish to harm anyone. Surely, if we fight here, now, we shall destroy a
	goodly section of the surrounding terrain. There is a population center near
	here. I would not wish to involve them in our conflict. May I suggest a later
	time, and a more remote location?

Cid: This will not be done later, this will be done now, and I know where...
Alanna: Then I will follow.
Cid: Like hell you will.

Just then, Cid vanishes and appears behind Alanna, wraping his arms around her tightly,
so that it is a struggle to breathe.  Then, he uses his instant transmission technique
to teleport to a desolate planet, in what seemed like a city that once would have
teamed with life, but now, only cackles in the light of the full moon..from decaying
houses, and broken trees.

Cid: You like this, Alanna? Can you hear it?

He tightens his grip even more, making it nigh impossible to Alanna to even make a move
to escape.

Cid: This is the old planet, the one you erased the <i>stain</i> of Saiya-jin life from
	...this was my home, the one you destoyed, that held the family you killed...

Alanna is now doing everything in her power to try to escape, but weakening as she
struggles for air, which seems to be growing thinner, as Cid moves his arms to just below
her lungs, and tightens to make breathing that much more difficult.

Alanna: I..*gasp*...
Cid: Can you hear it? The voices of the dead, crying out for mercy, the mercy you never
	gave them, even though we did nothing to you...

Alanna is now heaving as she tries to breathe, and attempting to kick, punch, and
possibly use her wings as a weapon, but not inflicting any damage no matter what she
does, but she does manages to create an energy blade, which she attempts to impale into
Cid, but it fades away as she strikes Cid with it.

Cid: You took everything, killed everyone...except me...I was what your master feared,
	was I not? One in the Saiya-jin race, born into a legend with extreme power?
	Power that could possibly defeat him? I was that Legend...I was born with a power
	level of that around 180,000... 170,000 more even than that of the First
	Legendary Super Saiya-jin of long ago...

Alanna is now seriously short of breath, her chest heaving with every breath she takes
as if it would be her last.  She gasps for air.  Cid tightens his hold even more, and she
leans back against him, mouth open, and looks into his cold, blue eyes. Hers glaze over,
and half close.

Cid: Do you remember this? This was the hold you had my mother in...right before you
	created an energy blade, and killed her...I won't do that, robbing you of your
	life slowly is more than enough for me.
Alanna:[gasping, eyes focused on Cid] huh uuuuuhhhhh..
Cid: I always wanted to hear your voice...such a sweet voice being taken away. Can you
	feel it? Death's breath upon your lips, ready to give you the final kiss, and
	send you on your journey to hell, his scythe inching along where I hold you,
	ready to burst you open and take you away, just as you had made him so many years
	ago...

Cid quickly turns Alanna around, still keeping a hold on her so tight that she could
not possibly try to breathe, and uses one hand to gently lift her face up to his.

Cid: This is how it ends, milady, your path of destruction is now...over.

Cid pulls Alanna's face closer, as if to kiss her, then moves his hand down to her neck.
He twists his hand.  A loud <font size=3>snap</font> echoes across the vacant plaza.

Cid: It's over, now.  Let your judgment lay with the bodies of the dead...

Cid then lays Alanna's body out in the middle of what seems to be the town square.

Cid: I would say rest in peace...but after what you have done...?

As Cid walks away...he hears a voice which sounds like his mothers..."Thank you Cid...now
I can finally rest...and so can our people..." it then fades away into nothingness.

Cid: Mother...

Cid's Phoenix Magicite falls out of what seems to be a sensu bean bag, and resonates.

Cid: What...is it doing...?

The Phoenix Magicite slowly lifts up off the ground, and floats next to Cid's face,
emitting a gentle blue aura that pulses with every passing moment.

Cid: What...what is it doing?

The magicite lets out a soft chime as it resonates.

Cid: Something is happening...

Just then, the magicite glows bright blue, flies up into the air, and shatters.  As that
happens, the sky grows pitch black, and an aurora fills the sky, tracing over each inch
of the land.

Cid: What is it doing??

Cid begins to hear voices, and peers around him, only to see bodies materalize out of
what seems to be nothingness, and slowly rise, shaking their heads and groaning as they
stand.

Man: Where...where am I??No way!!! I'm back!! I'm truly back!!

The man is greeted by his wife and child, who rush him and tackle him with a hug and a
kiss.

Man: Oh my god!! How did we get back??
Woman: I don't know, but we are!! Look, everyone, they are back!! All of us.  Back.

The city now teams with life again 

Cid: Unreal...I had no idea...

Cid hears a voice from behind, and immediately turns around.

Cid: M..mother???
Cid's Mom: Cid...is that you!!?!?? OH MY GOD!! You have grown so much!!!! And you
	liberated us!!! You made the twin legends come true, it seems,...your hair, you
	dyed it didn't you!? You go wash that stuff out right now young man!!
Cid: Mom...
Cid's Mom: I am just kidding...your father..where is your father!?

She looks anxiously about, and immediatly finds a face se has been longing to see, the 
one that belongs to Cid's father, who promptly tackles his son and wife.

Cid's Dad: What happened? Where is Tracy??? I just know it is so good to be back....
Tracy: Mother!!! Father!!! Cid!!!! You are all alive!!! Cid, how did you grow so much?
	You must have taken drugs or something...[shifty look]
Cid:[gets to his feet] Nope, I did some Time and Spirit training though...each day you
	spend in there is equal to one year, so lets just say I have spend quite a few
	days training...
Tracy: You did it!!!! You used the Phoenix...I knew that rock would come in handy sooner
	or la- [sees Alanna's body] It's her...she's back....no, not again! We just came
	back...

The loud noises of cheer suddenly silenced, an eerie calm descends as everyone recognizes
Alanna's body, and it begins to twitch, slowly.

Cid: I should have done more...I will, too..[powers up, aura returns]
Alanna: mmm uuh...what, where am I??? [begins to sit up]

Cid slowly walks towards Alanna, lightning sparking off of his aura, and just then hears
a voice...

>:Don't kill her!!! 

Cid: huh??? [looks around]
Phoenix: Don't kill her..she is torn between two people, and can not always control her
	actions...trust me in this...I revived your people, now revive her, by giving her
	a chance...it is a risk, but are you are a risk taker...or not?
Cid: ....

Cid kneels down by Alanna and looks at her, seeing that though her eyes are glazed over
and still, her body still gasps for air.

Cid: No matter what I do, you won't die will you?? 

He picks up Alanna in firemans carry and looks around.

Cid: I don't know if I am gonna kill you for sure or not, I should probably let your
	regain your strength before fighting you again...

He carries Alanna to an old temple and lays her down on a bed, then leans back on a
chair, and closing his eyes. A shard of the phoenix magicite falls down and lands on
Alanna's stomach, and resonates.

Voice: Do you want to be liberated?? Forget your ways and walk in the light? You can be
	purified, if you agree to face your self, and defeat it...if not, if you
	disagree, Cid will kill you, even if he must be aided by myself... I can heal
	you, and make your body anew, custom to what you see in your mind and want
	yourself to be, all you have to do is accept, or die... 
Alanna: ..... 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Long story, huh?  Well, the end is coming.  Wait, no, it isn't.  Never mind.  ^.^;

What will happen next time, on Here's the Deal?  Will Alanna accept the pheonix's deal?
Will Babobo find a way to get uncursed?  And what's with the evil sausage thing, anyways?
Find out, in Chapter six!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What's going on, you ask?  Well, read chapters 1-5, and find out!  Or not, as the case
may be.

Scene: The void
A large, flaming bird hovers there. 2 women, nearly identical. Both have one deep blue
eye, but the other is radically different. One's eye is a deep crimson, the color of
blood. The others is a gentle forest green.

Pheonix: Do you wish to be freed? To forget your past actions and walk in the light? I
	will help you do this, Alanna, if you agree to face your dark self, and defeat
	it. I can heal your mind, and make your body anew, into whatever you wish.
Alanna: And if I do not agree?
Pheonix: I will allow Cid to kill you. If I must, I will aid him in it.
Tisiphone: You'll destroy us, anyways. We are too powerful.
Pheonix: Silence!!

A brilliant golden wave lashes out from the Pheonix, and encases Tisiphone in an energy
matrix that prevents Tis from contributing to the conversation.

Alanna: My past actions...I would have given much to be free of those memories, once.
	But now, I see them as a warning. A warning that I must have control over myself.
	I have turned from the dark path already, freed myself of the control that Kagato
	had over my body, and I have begun the trek to the light. But it would mean
	nothing if someone just placed me on that path. The reason I go to that path is
	because it is what *I* want to do, not merely because it is the right path. 
Pheonix: ...
Alanna: You speak of my dark side, my dark half. Where is it? 
Pheonix: ...
Alanna: I am my own dark half. Long ago, I fought Tisiphone down, conquered her, because
	*I* wanted to do something myself. 

Alanna approaches the pheonix, and stands in front of it defiantly.

Alanna:[quietly, calmly] Do you know what I did? Let me tell you. The man, no, the beast,
	that was called Thomas de la Lande. I killed him. Not quickly. Slowly. I tortured
	him to death. 16 days of torture, he took. [almost whispered, with intensity] 
	<i>And I enjoyed it.</i> Every minute of it. [pause, normal] Let me ask you, Pheonix.
	Which of us is the dark half, now?
Pheonix: Neither, and both.
Alanna: To let her be destroyed, to destroy her myself, would destroy what I am. We are
	one, and the same.

The energy cage around Tisiphone dissolves. She steps forward, triumphant. Alanna moves
towards her. 

Tisiphone: What are you doing? You aren't going to listen to that overstuffed turkey,
	are you?
Alanna: No. I'm not. Pheonix! If I kill her, I kill myself. If I let you meddle with me,
	I become nothing more than a pawn. I swore, as soon as I could, that I would
	never be used again. 
Pheonix: Very well. You have made your choice. Are you prepared to face the consequences?
Alanna: It is time for this farce to be done with, Tis.
Tisiphone: [cold, dispassionate] Very well.

A strange light begins to emanate from the two of them. Slowly, the light consumes them,
and they drift together. From within, voices can be heard. "So, how long will we make it
this time?" "Not sure, hopefully...we'll never split again."

As the two begin to connect, a brilliant light emanates from them, putting even the
burning glory of the pheonix to shame, and briefly illuminating the void. The pheonix
bows its head, and leaves.

Scene: The old Temple 

The shard of the Stone of the Pheonix that lies on Alanna slowly lifts up, and returns
to Cid's pouch. He stirs. A strange aura appears around Alanna, and her enhanced form is
subtly altered. Her wings, once silvery in hue, now are almost pure white. She opens her
eyes. One is deep blue, the other is a deep, opaque black. Small sparks of electricity
still flicker deep in her eyes. Slowly, she stands, looking over at the fighter beside
her, the man who had so nearly killed her. Tracy comes to the door, to see what is going
on. She sees the monster that had destroyed her homeland standing over the limp body of
her brother.

Tracy: NOOOOO!! 

Many of the adults in the village run to the temple, gathering weapons as they go. When
they reach it, they see Tracy standing, shaking with fear, in front of Alanna, and behind
them both, Cid's limp body. Alanna doesn't move.

Alanna: Do not fear. I will harm none here.

She raises her hands to the air, and the townsfolk prepare to sell their lives dearly.
Power begins to rush out of Alanna. The massive Ki surge awakens Cid.

Cid: What the... 

Slowly, the flood of Ki from Alanna trickles off, and dies down completely. Her wings
have vanished. She has no more energy than a normal human being, now. The armor around
her left hand and arm slowly disappears. Slowly, she sinks to the ground, unconscious.

--Elsewhere--

Narrator: Tonnica (who has been brutally ignored in this story) is cooking when suddenly
	A.C appears.

A.C: That smells wonderful!
Tonnica: Oh thank you!
A.C: Can you do something for me?
Tonnica: OK, as long as it doesn't involve any hot strawberry cream...
A.C: I need a potion.
Tonnica: I see, what recepie should I use?
A.C: I need a Love Potion...
Tonnica: !!!
A.C: We will make a love potion, then we poison the water with it and before we know it,
	we will have everyone kissing and hugging each other!
Tonnica: Kawai!! Romantiku!

Narrator: Meanwhile, Alanna has just woken up after being unconscious...

Alanna: Where am I?
Handsome Guy: You are still in the village.
Alanna: I must find Cid...
Handsome Guy: No, you must rest.
Alanna: Rest? I rest when I die! I must fight Cid!
Handsome Guy: Let us take care of you first.
Alanna: I'm not gonna let any men touch me!
Handsome Guy: Please, it's not good for a pretty girl like you to be this violent...
Alanna: Girl? Pretty girl!? You can be a pretty girl yourself, pansy!! I love violence!
	It is all that I live for!
Handsome Guy: Please, you must give love a chance...
Alanna: Love!!!? Love is just another word for sex!, and sex is an evil sin!!
Handsome Guy: No, what are you saying? Everybody needs love, and sex is a wonderful
	thing too!
Alanna: A wonderful thing!!? That's it! I've heard enough! 

*Alanna takes her big sword and cuts of the handsome guy's head* 

Alanna: Cid, where are you! I'm going to find you! All I want is to fight with you!!

Narrator: As Alanna is pursuing her only enjoyment in life, A.C and Tonnica have finished
	making the love potion... 

Tonnica: Let us infect the world with love!
A.C: Yes, but let us not use the water. We should spread it through the atmosphere so
that nobody can escape!
Tonnica: Good idea, I think Washu can help.
A.C: Good, let's go and ask Washu.

Narrator: A.C and Tonnica goes to find Washu...

A.C. wakes up, and looks around him. He sees the same view that he's seen for the past
week. A small pillar, that he is currently lieing on. A horde of tentacle monsters trying
to climb said pillar. For some odd reason, he couldn't escape. He sighs, and goes back to
his dream world.

--Back at the Masaki home--

Kagato: Oh man, I think I'm done.
Ryoko: Hey, you can't stop now!
Kagato: Hey, I'm supposed to be the guy in charge of this whole operation, I can't be
	hungover because I drank too much sake.
Ryoko: Well, whatever. I guess that leaves more for me and the old man!
Kagato: Right. Well, I think I'll go check on X. He's been in Washu's lab for a long
	time. 

--In the lab...--

Kagato: Yo, X, you in here?
X: Hey. I'm kinda busy. 

Kagato looks at the almost completed gear. It closely resembles X's Tiamat, except for a
different color sceme and a large energy cannon attached to the left arm.

Kagato: Hey, you've really outdone yourself.
X: Thanks. I'm almost done calibrating the controls.

Kagato walks over to a computer terminal and takes a look at the design specs for the
new gear. 

Kagato: Hm...This machine surpasses yours in every area. Impressive weapons system. I
	see you also adapted the Tallgeese's vernier engines to allow for greater
	mobility.
X: Well, it's not as manuverable as the Tallgeese, and the beam cannon isn't quite as
	powerful. The frame couldn't handle all the extra weight and I don't really have
	that much time to design and build this thing. I've got one more machine to do
	after this one.
Kagato: Oh? And just who are you building these for?
X: This one is for Alanna, and the other one will be for Yuzuha.
Kagato: Well, do you want some help? We leave in less than two days.
X: Yeah, that would be great.
Kagato: Well, lets get to work.

~	~	~

At daybreak, Magus set out for the village he saw yesterday for information. He trudged
through a small swamp, with rustling shapes all around. However, he saw no sausages.
When he came to the outskirts of the village, he stopped to rest.

Magus: Jeez... I came a long way.

Magus looked up at the sun, realizing that it was past noon already. Then, he noticed
that his stomach was growling. He opened his pack and got out the sliced sausage he had
killed last night. He started a small fire and heated the sausage, and when it was done,
he left none of it. He cleaned up, then began towards the village again. He went directly
to the market, because news circulated swiftly there.

Magus: Excuse me, ma'am.
Woman: Yes? Can I help you?
Magus: I'm looking for someone.
Woman: What's your name, stranger?
Magus: Magus. And I'm looking for someone named Kesshu.
Woman: Kesshu? Never heard of 'im.
Magus: Hm... Perhaps he goes by X again.
Woman: Oh, yes, X! 

Memories came flooding back to Magus...

-flashback- 

X: Magus! Watch out behind you!

Magus spun around quickly, and speared the demonic sausage, then leapt back towards X.

Magus: X, we can't fight all of them at once!
X: I know... Damn! We have to retreat!
Magus: Let's go!

And with that, they turned and fled away from the mysterious ancient ruins...

-end flashback-

Magus: ...Ma'am... Can you tell me where he is?

--Black Field with white letters: 2 Days, 36 hours remaining.-- 
Mastermune: What the hell was that?
El Queso: Spill over from a Majora's Mask binge.
Mastermune: That hardly seems professional.... 

Narrator #5: And a lack of professional behavior is what Babobo excells at right now.
	Instead of being a responsable pilot/ commander and working on his Gear he
	decided it was too nice a day and went fishing in the pond.

(cut to Babobo at the pond, a few tugs at the line but nothing really good, until the
line started bobbing like a speed bag being slaped around by a jackhammer. After much
grunting, and heaveing Babobo pulled ashore what he was sure was one bad ass fish. But
it wasn't.)

Babobo: What the hell is it? Hey El Queso, Mastermune, get over here.
El Queso: what is that?
Doreen: Looks like an egg.
Masa&Mune: Let's bust it open and see the creamy center.
Doreen: What?!?
El Queso: I think I know what it is. Sir, look at your Digivice.
Babobo looks at the digivice on his satchel: Well I'll be damned, must be one o' those
	Digieggs I've been hearing about. Think it'll work on you El Queso?
El Queso: I'm an Omnigear, not a digimon.
Babobo: So? I used this digivice as one of your components since I brought you online.
	It should be compatible.
Washu: A digivolveing gear, I should have thought of that one!
Babobo: GAH!! WASHU!!!
Digivice: SQUEEEEEEEEEEEE SQUEEE SQUEEEE
Washu: Relax, I'm not here to bend you to my will, yet.  I'm more subtle than that.
Digivice: .......
Washu:{Looking at sphereoid] I think, that with El Queso's already greatly augmented and
	rebuilt components this should theoreticaly boost his armour and power output.
	Maybe even make him bigger. 
Babobo, El Queso, and Mastermune: Sweet, we can morph.
Washu: I believe the term is 'digivolve.' Now, to bend you to my will...
Babobo: Oh shit.
Digivice: SQUEEEEEE SQUEEEE SQUEEEE
El Queso: El Queso armor digivolve to King del Queso.

(As King Del Queso, the gear formerly known as El Queso looks like Arthur from Cannon Spike only
instead of the gunlance excaliber King Del Queso actually has a normal arm)

Babobo, Mastermune: Sweet.
Washu: I'm more subtle than that. I came out here to help you digivolve El Queso and to give you
	this.

White letters super imposed on screen: Babobo got bumper sticker.

Washu: Since you lost the Mr. Yuck sticker fighting the hordes of the now deceased El 
	Lumpas Cron, I figured you could use a new one.
Mastermune: What's it say?
Babobo: "Hail to the King"
King Del Queso: I feel...mighty.

--Back at the house--

Bent: I almost killed everyone....I feel so bad...
Deneb: Oh, don't be sad honey, sorrow makes you age.
Slust: Honestly the women around here have to much power, I liked it better back home,
	where I was the hero.
Fogel: I'm glad I'm free to leave that island, I owe you an everlasting debt.
Bent: I Know!! To make up for almost killing everyone, I can go ahead and start fighing
	the Empire.
Deneb: Oh, Bent darling, your so manly.
Bent: Ah...Yeah...
Fogel: As you wish...
Slust:[All the pretty girls will be scared and need comforting] Sure!! I'm with ya.

Bent and his party leave preemptively off toward the Dalmuld Desert, from there the
attack on the Empire will begin. {Read side story: Bent's Tale}

Animal awakens after a long sleep.

Animal: *yawn* where the hell am I? How long have I been asleep? 

Animal starts walking in the desert.

Animal: GIL! ED! JC! Where are they? Are they alright? Will I ever see them again?

The sands of desert are displaced.

Animal: Ed. You're alive. 
Ed: Yeah.
Animal: Where are Gil and JC?
Ed: I'm sure JC is drunk and Gil is eating.
Animal: Well, I guess not a lot has changed. Let's leave them.
Ed: Yeah, well let's see if anyone else is alive.

They start walking, and Animal and Ed pass Bent and his crew.

Animal and Ed: Hi.

They continue on their way, since these two groups don't know each other yet.

--Magus--

Magus follows the woman closely through the small village and up a long dirt path leading
into the mountains. At the end of the path was a large house by a lake.

Magus: I think I can handle it from here. Thank you very much.
Woman: Oh, you're very welcome. I try to be a good samaratin.

Magus reached into his pack and handed the woman 100 Gil.

Woman: You are too kind. Thank you.

And with that, she turned and headed back towards the village. Magus stared up at the
house. 

Magus: X... 

Magus knocks on the door, and a small girl with long blue hair answers.

Sasami: Hi, who are you?
Magus: Uh, I'm Magus. Can you tell me where X is?
Sasami: Sure. He's in Washu's lab. He's busy working on something with Kagato.
Magus: Washu's...lab?
Sasami: It's over there.

Sasami points to a closet under the stairs leading to the second floor.

Magus: Huh? That's it? It doesn't look very big. Well, thanks for your help.
Sasami: You're welcome. 

Magus opens the door and steps inside. He gasps as he looks upon an amazingly large lab.
He sees Kagato and X working on two huge gears.

Magus: Kagato! X!

Kagato and X jumped from surprise, and turned to Magus.

Kagato and X: Magus!!

(The pillar A.C is lieing on suddenly collapses, and A.C falls to the ground, and is
instantly buried under hundreds of tentacle monsters.

A.C: No! You can't do this to me!

Mysterious Voice: Yes, I can.)

--Washu's Lab--

X: So, Magus, what brings you here?
Magus: Well, I'm hunting the evil sausages, and I thought maybe you could help me.
X: Well, as you can see, I'm kinda busy right now.
Magus: Yeah, I can see that. But what are you doing when you finish with this?
Kagato: Well, we leave tomorrow to fight the Zenobian Empire.
Magus: Hey, can I help? I'm sure they have something to do with the evil sausages.
X: Sure.
Magus: So, uh, what are you working on?
X: Well, this one is called Nemesis.

X motioned to the first gear, which had already been completed. It is black and gold,
with a huge bean cannon attached to its left arm.

Kagato: And this other one is Abigor. We, uh, still haven't finished it.
Magus: So, what's taking you so long?
X: Well, uh, we're having trouble coming up with a good design.
Magus: It's a gear, not a freakin work of art.
Kagato: Yeah, but it still needs to look cool.
Magus: Well, do you want me to help you guys?
X: Hey, that'd be nice.

Magus looks the gear up and down.

Magus: For one, the colors are all wrong. And the arms are badly proportioned. 	That may
	help a little. But...I'm starving.

Suddenly, Mihoshi walks in.

Kagato&X: Don't touch anything!!!
Magus: Who's the sexy blonde?
Mihoshi: Hey, I came to tell you that Sasami said lunch is ready.
Magus: Alright, food! See you guys later.
Kagato: Okay, see ya.
X: So, uh, what about the gear?
Mihoshi: Hey, can I help? Say, what does this do?
Kagato&X: Don't touch it!!

Suddenly, a powerful shockwave is felt throughout the area.

--At the Masaki shrine...--

Yosho: Hm...Mihoshi must have destroyed those two gears X and Kagato were building...

--Back in the lab...--

X: Ow...
Kagato: Mihoshi...
Mihoshi-with tears in her eyes-: I'm sorry, -sniff- I'm so, so sorry. I didn't mean to,
	-sniff- touch it.
X: Well, we do have backups of each gear.
Kagato: We gotta thank Washu later for thinking ahead.
