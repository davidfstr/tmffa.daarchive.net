			         Epilogue



	Sasami was lost deep in the forest.  She knew the section of
woods surrounding the Masaki residence and shrine by heart, but this
deep into the forest was completely foreign to her.  When Ayeka
stomped off so abruptly, Sasami lost track of her and eventually
wound up wandering in the wrong direction, so as the day wore on, the
girl became more and more worried when she did not see any familiar
landmarks.

	"Where am I?  I thought this trail would take me back to the
house, but I don't see it anywhere!" she despaired, almost on the
verge of tears.

	The young girl continued her walk.  It was not long before she
came across what looked to be a small, red airplane parked in the
middle of a clearing.  It had a cockpit positioned on top with a clear
dome, now open, that would afford protection to any pilot sitting
inside.  The craft looked unarmed except for the long, thin gun that
hung mounted beneath the vehicle.  Slight carbon scores accumulated
through repeated use marked the otherwise plain looking weapon.

	It not entirely clear if the pilot was somewhere near his
ship or kilometers away.  By all appearances the plane looked to have
been sitting there only moments, but nowhere in the clearing, at
least from where she stood in the forest, could Sasami detect the
ship's operator.  She started to walk out into the clearing in order
to get a closer look at the craft when she quickly ducked behind a
tree.  Evidently the pilot was around.

	Standing on the ground just behind a red wing was a man in
his late twenties.  He leaned against his ship and stared up into the
sky, one hand scratching his brown hair and one hand holding him up.
The scratching motion caused the man's tie to swing gently between
the blue lapels of his suit.

	I hope he's not dangerous.  He looks sort of friendly, Sasami
thought as she took a step into the stranger's clearing.  A pile of
leaves rustled as the young Juraian princess stepped over it.  The
noise was very slight, but the stranger must have had perfect hearing
because he jerked his head to ascertain the cause of the unnatural
noise.  Seeing Sasami standing there caused him to visibly relax.

	"Whoa.  You made me nervous there...say, would you happen to
know directions to the nearest town?  I seem to be lost."  It was
obvious the man in the bluish suit did not enjoy asking for help from
a mere child, but it was equally obvious that he was lost and had no
choice.

	"I'm lost myself.  I wish I could help you...I know!  If you
can take me up into the air with your ship, I can point out the way
to a friend's house!  He'll know where you should go."  Sasami
smiled, then frowned suddenly.  "I'm sorry.  I've been rude.  My name
is Sasami.  It's nice to meet you!" the girl exclaimed as she
politely bowed.

	"Nice to meet you.  Are you ready to go?" the man asked.  He
pulled a cigarette out of his breast pocket and began to smoke,
presumably to calm his tensions.

	Sasami nodded then climbed into the stranger's ship.  Even
though she had always been warned against trusting strangers, the
princess did not even consider that this might be dangerous; her
cheery personality would not allow her.  Engines toiled underneath
the red exterior and the sleek ship swiftly rose high above the
forest floor.

	"Do you see the house, Sasami?"

	"Yeah!  It's right over there!"  Sasami pointed out the
direction they should take.  She was so glad to be on her way home
that she began to laugh, a very musical and warm sound.

	Within minutes they arrived.  The man set his aircraft down
beside the lower half of the house, and both passengers scrambled
down the side of the ship almost as soon as the engines cut off.  The
sight of the house's condition was no surprise to the princess, but
the man had his doubts.  After all, why would a girl as young and
buoyant as the one he brought live in a place as bad off as this?

	"Is this it?  It looks like whoever lives here has had a real
time of it."  The man peered into the house, hands in pockets,
searching for possible danger.

	"Yep!  This is the place!  I'll go and get Tenchi.  He'll
know where you can go to reach a town."  Sasami darted in the
direction of the house.  Halfway, Ryo-Ohki ran out to greet her
friend, and a flurry of "mea's!" ensued as the cabbit told the girl
all about her day.  She jumped on top of Sasami's head and they went
inside together to get Tenchi.

	The brown-haired man pulled another cigarette out of his
pocket.  He placed it in his mouth while his other hand brought up
the lighter.  It had been hours since he had seen anything other than
trees, and quiet frankly, the man was growing irritated at all the
fresh air and greenery.  If he did not get back to where he came from
and soon, he felt sure he would go crazy.

	Moments later, barely quick enough to satisfy the man's
impatience, Tenchi appeared.  He walked up to the red ship, bowed to
the man, and introduced himself.  "Hi!  My name is Tenchi Masaki.
We're all very grateful that you brought Sasami home."

	The man tried to be polite, but it was obvious he was in a
hurry.  "Yeah, sure kid.  Do you know where the nearest town is?  I
seem to be lost, and I need to check in with my partner."

	Tenchi pointed off in the distance.  "If you go in that
direction, you'll reach the closest city in no time.  Do you mind if
I ask your name?"

	The man halfway smiled.  "It's Spike.  Take care kid, and
thanks for the directions."  He threw his cigarette butt down onto
the grass and climbed into the ship, closing the hatch behind him.
It was not long before he vanished over the trees.

	A door opened and closed, and Washu walked up next Tenchi
just in time to see the red craft wink into the distance.  "Who was
that, Tenchi?"

	"Oh, hey, Little Washu.  He said his name was Spike.  He's
the one who brought Sasami home."  Tenchi took a step toward the
house but paused at the sound of Washu's voice.

	"Hey, Tenchi...what was that he flew off in?"

	"It looked like some sort of red aircraft.  I'm not sure, but
it looked like it could go into space.  I've never seen anything like
it before!"  Tenchi waited in case Washu had another question.  She
did.

	"Hmm...nothing that small could be space worthy AND from
Earth in the present era.  Did he happen to say where he was from?"
Washu asked.

	"Nope.  Though he did say he got lost out in the forest
somehow."  That was not the answer Washu wished to hear.

	"Doh!"  She smacked her forehead.  "It looks like one portal
closed only to open up another in a completely different spot!  I
knew there was something wrong with the way it sealed!"

	Tenchi frowned slightly in concern.  "So does this mean we're
going to have to track him down?"

Washu sighed.  "It sure does.  Tenchi, I've got something very
important that I need for us to do.  Our well-being depends upon
following my instructions to the letter."

	"What's that Little Washu?" Tenchi asked very seriously.
"Does it have to do with closing that other dimensional rift?"

	The young man was prepared for most anything Washu would ask
him to do.  After all, did not a crown prince, especially of a planet
as important as Jurai, have some responsibility for the safety of
innocent people?  He expected Washu to use him for some kind of
experimental tracking device, or tell him to quickly board Ryo-Ohki
and chase after, or even ask him to miss school (Tenchi had since
found another) for this undertaking, an especially large price to pay
with his university entrance exams on the horizon.  However, of the
things he did not expect to be asked of, Washu was about to ask him
to do.  In fact, her charge was completely and utterly opposite
Tenchi's expections.

	The petite scientist beamed a smile brilliant as her intellect
and casually said, "How 'bout we go eat!  All this work has really
given me an appetite!"

	Tenchi fell on his face.

	"What?" Washu asked with feigned ignorance. The term
"nonchalant" would be an understatement.





























































































































		    ****  SUPER SECRET OUTTAKES  ****


			   Part 1: Scene Three


Director:	Okay, Washu.  In this scene we're going to place you
		in your lab.  You'll be sitting there at your computer
		when a giant fish goes after its lunch in that glass
		tank behind you -- I suppose the writer wanted to
		include foreshadowing or something...  Anyway, all
		you have to do is sit there, and the camera will do
		the rest.

Washu:		Great, great.  What's my motivation?

Director:	You're a scientist aren't you?  Make with the
		scientific already!  Ac--TION!

Washu:		*staring at her computer screen, obviously troubled
		over what is displayed there*  Hmmm...


* Behind her in the tank, the enormous predatory fish starts to chase
  a few smaller ones...then it spots Washu.  It swims in a loop then
  charges the glass.  The first ram cracks it; water spews through
  the openings.  The second pass knocks a hole through the tank, and
  the giant fish jumps into the lab, landing on Washu with a squishy
  plop.  The fish knocks the scientist to the ground and completely
  covers her with its generous mass. *


Washu:		Oompf! *mumbles something from underneath the fish*

Fish:		*Soon realizing it cannot survive outside its aquatic
		 environment, it begins to flop around, trying to get
		 back inside the tank.  Unfortuneately for Washu, she
		 is stuck underneath*

Director:	*rapidly thumbing through a stack of papers in his
		 hand*  Uhh...is that in the script?  Anybody?

Washu:		Hey!...*thud*...HEY!...*thud*...Get this thing off
		of me!...*thud*...I don't get paid enough for
		this!...*squish, plop, thud*

Director:	*cupping his hand next to the side of his mouth and
		 yelling at the bottom portion of the fish*  Don't
		worry, Washu!  We'll get you out!

		*aside to a member of the crew*  Tell the intern to
		go out and get some lemons...*he takes a look at
		the fish*...and lots of them.

			   Part 3: Scene 3


Stunt Coordinator:
		Okay, Tenchi, I want you to stand over there in front
		of that tree.  Good.  Duo, go stand a few paces in
		front of him.   No, that's too far...there you go.

Tenchi:  	What are we doing again?

Director:  	*from off in the background*  Making magic!  Possibly
		even the BEST Tenchi Muyo! episode EVER produced!
		All because I'm such a wonderful director.  You guys
		are SO lucky to have me around!

* Tenchi, Duo, and the Stunt Coordinator drop what they're doing,
  turn swiftly around, and stare at the director. *


Director:  	What?  Stop looking at me like that...what?!

Stunt Coordinator:
		...as I was ABOUT to say before SOME moron interjected
		his inane babble into my instructions, the script says
		that "the other boy" - that's you Maxwell - will say
		something to distract Tenchi whilst you lunge forward
		to break his arm.

Tenchi:		WHAT?!

Stunt Coordinator:
		Don't worry about it, Tenchi.  I'm here to make sure
		he doesn't REALLY break your arm.  He's just going to
		make it look like he did.  Now, Duo, you are to-

Duo:		Yeah, okay.  I think I've got the idea already.

Stunt Coordinator:
		Are you sure?  We haven't exactly gone over it all
		yet...

Duo:		No problem!  I read the script.

Director:	*coming up from behind*  That's the ticket!  Places!
		And...ac-TION!


* Tenchi and Duo fight over control of the light sword.  After a bit
  of brawling, Duo grabs Tenchi's arm and gives it a fierce twist.
  Snapping sounds ensue. *


Tenchi:		OWWWWWWWWW!  My arm!  My arm!  What have you done, you
		idiot?!

Duo:		*rubbing the back of his head and grinning nervously*
		Uh...broke your arm...?  Script...?  Heh...heh?  Sorry
		about that...them's the breaks...?  Oooo, man.  I'm so
		sorry, Tenchi!  I can't seem to get these bad puns out
		of my dialogue...

Stunt Coordinator:
		Now see, Duo?  This is why we needed to go over it: so
		nobody gets hurt.  Besides, when you ACTUALLY broke
		his arm, it didn't look as real as it would have if we
		had done it MY way.  We'll probably just have to do
		the scene over again.  *nodding his head*  Mm-hmm.
		Mm-hmm.

Tenchi:		*groans as he sinks to his knees*

Duo:		Uhh...will you be...um...okay?  Heh...heh...heh...

Tenchi:		Does it LOOK like I'm okay?

Duo:		Gee.  Show a little backbone, Tenchi.  It's just a
		few broken bones and a couple of severed tendons.
		I've had worse!

Tenchi:		Grrrr!

Duo:		A joke...nevermind... *he hurriedly looks in the
		other direction*


* Deathscythe emerges through the trees into the clearing.  A member
  of the crew pilots the mobile suit slowly towards the group in
  preparation for the next scene.  The director motions to him where
  he should park it. *


Pilot:		Is this where you wanted it?

Director:	That's perfect.  Wait...a little to the left...


* The suit takes a minute step left; a massive metal leg comes down on
  Tenchi, knocking him to the ground and forcing him to sink into the
  foam forest floor. *


Director:	Oooo...sorry about that, Tenchi.  That was totally my
		fault.  Uhh...did I tell you what a great performance
		you had in that last scene...?

Tenchi:		*muffled from being underneath the giant foot*
		Worker's comp!  Worker's comp!

Director:	...we'll talk...

			Epilogue: Scene 1


Director:	According to the script, this is the part where
		Sasami comes out into the clearing to ask Spike for
		directions.  Places, everybody!  And...ac-TION!

Sasami:		I'm lost myself.  I wish I could help you...smoke
		that cigarette!

Director:	Cut!  Sasami, that's not your line!

Sasami:		I know.  I'm sorry!  Let's try it again.

Director:	Let's start a few lines later.  We're pressed for time
		here, people.  Ac-TION!

Sasami:		I'm sorry.  I've been rude.  My name is Sasami.  It's
		nice to meet you...especially since you have tobacco
		sticks!  Please!  Give me a drag!

Director:	Cut!  Sasami!  Have you even read the script?!

Sasami:		I have. *a sweat drop forms on her brow.*  Please
		forgive me.  I'm trying to break this smoking habit.
		I know it's no excuse, but it's my first day, and
		it's really tough.

Director:	That's okay, Sasami.  Let's just skip that scene too
		and go to the one where you and Spike are cruising in
		his spaceship.  Places!  Ac-TION!

Spike:		Do you see the house, Sasami?

Sasami:		Yeah!  It's right over there! *aside to Spike as
		quietly as possible*  Can I bum a cigarette?

Spike:		*quietly*  What?

Sasami:		*whispering*  Would you give me one of your
		cigarettes?  I'm dying over here.

Spike:		*in a hushed tone*  I still can't hear what you're
		asking me.

Sasami:		GIVE ME ONE OF YOUR CIGARETTES YOU  *#@*)*#%~  SON OF
		A  *$!&^  BEFORE I  (@*)*#*\  OR I SWEAR I'LL &\/^*@~`
		-*=+&/*#^!("{-]*_--!#&*  RIGHT BEFORE THE GIRAFFE
		DOES!!!

Director:	*slack jawed and bug eyed*  ...cut...

Spike:		I think you have a serious addiction here, Sasami.
		Besides, aren't you a little young to be smoking?

Sasami:		Tell that to the girls at school who started me on
		this habit.  Now may I *please* have one of your
		smokes?

Spike:		If it will keep you quiet and let us get on with the
		episode, sure.  *takes a cigarette out of his pocket
		and hands it to Sasami*

Sasami:		*starts puffing on the "coffin nail"*  Ahhh... *she
		blows a puff of smoke into the cockpit*  Sweet, sweet
		nicotine...
