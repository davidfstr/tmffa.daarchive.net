          Chapter 2: Sad Memories

               Wufei sat on his bed, thinking.  "How did we get
          here?"  He
          wondered, supporting his chin with his palm.  Then he
          heard a knock
          at the door.
          "Who is it?"  He asked.

          "Just me."  Said a cheerful voice.
          Wufei knew who it was and raised his eyebrows lightly.
           "Come in."
          Duo walked in, closing the door behind him, and leaned
          against the
          wall, folding his arms.  "So what do you think about all
          this?"  Duo
          asked, grinning.
          Wufei shrugged, staring at the floor.  "I have no idea."
          Duo closed his eyes, still grinning.  "You know, that
          princess is
          kinda cute."
          Wufei arched his eyebrow and stared at his friend.
           "Hmph."  He
          muttered under his breath.
          Duo opened his eyes at hearing Wufei&#8217;s response.
           "What?  Well she
          is."  He said, raising his hands up in the air.
          Wufei didn&#8217;t say anything.
          "Ofcourse I&#8217;ve never seen purple hair before."
           Duo lifted his
          eyebrows.  "Wonder if it&#8217;s here natural color?"

          A day later........

                 Ayeka threw another punch at her opponent, he
          dodged it and
          in turn threw one at her, but her speed had improved, so
          she quickly
          dodged it.  Grabbing his arm, and twisted it.  She
          looked at him,
          anger in her eyes because suddenly she saw the older
          version of
          Tenchi, holding Haruna.
                She grabbed the guys neck, tightening her grip.

          "Ayeka!"  Shouted a voice, bringing her back to reality
          from the
          memory.
          She gasped as she realized her opponent  was struggling
          for air.  She
          quickly let go and he felt to his knees, trying to catch
          his breath.
          Ayeka turned toward the voice.  "I&#8217;m sorry
          Sensei."  She apologized,
          looking at the floor.

          "Never let your emotions interfere when in combat."
           Said the older
          man.
          She nodded and bowed before running out of the room.
           Unaware of a
          pair of eyes that had watched the whole thing.
          Wufei raised his eyebrow as he watched her leave.
           "Interesting."  He
          thought.

                 Duo was walking through the halls trying to find
          his room
          when he was suddenly knocked to the floor.
          "Hey watch it!"  He said, rubbing the back of his head
          before
          realizing it was Ayeka who had ran into him.
          "I am sorry."  She apologized before getting up and
          continuing her
          running, tears forming in her eyes.
          Duo watched her, his eyes wide, wondering what that was
          all about.

                Ayeka made it to her room, slamming the door
          behind her, and
          collapsed to her knees, letting her tears fall freely.
           The memories
          of Tenchi were so painful.  Even on her own planet, she
          couldn&#8217;t
          forget it.  The distance didn&#8217;t matter, the images
          wouldn&#8217;t go away.
          "Tenchi......"  She whispered, whipping a tear from her
          eye.  "Why
          won&#8217;t you leave me alone?"

              Wufei walked through the hallway, spotting Duo not
          far away from
          him, looking at something.  Then he heard a door slam
          shut.  Curious,
          he approached his friend.
          "What happened?"  He asked.
          Duo shrugged.  "Don&#8217;t know.  Ayeka knocked me to
          the floor, then she
          ran up the stairs.  Must be a personal thing."
          Next thing they knew, they heard something break, and
          Duo, being the
          friendly type, took off up the stairs.
          Wufei was hesitant at first. Not wanting to get involved
          with
          personal matters, but followed his braided friend a
          moment later.

               Duo nervously approached Ayeka&#8217;s room, aware
          that her two
          guards were present, each on one side of her double
          doors.
          "Uh......."  He stuttered, trying to think of something
          to say to
          them.  When Wufei did it for him.
          "Ayeka seemed upset earlier, and we wanted to see if she
          is alright."
          Duo arched his eyebrow in wonderment.  He never saw
          Wufei concerned
          about a woman, or any woman for that matter.  But there
          was always a
          first time for everything.
          The logs looked at one another, and agreed.  "You may
          see her."  They
          said, moving away from the door.
          Wufei nodded at Duo, who in turn knocked on the door.
          "Leave me alone please."  Said the soft voice of  Ayeka.
          Duo frowned, but complied, turning and heading back for
          the stair
          case.  Osaka and Kamadake heard her request and left
          themselves.
          Wufei stood alone, and stood next to the doors.
           Listening.

               Ayeka sat on the floor, looking at the picture of
          Tenchi, aware
          that the glass frame was shattered.  The rage she felt
          caused her to
          break something, that being her picture of Tenchi.
           Sighing, she took
          out the hologram projector Yosho had given her so long
          ago.  Slowly,
          she pushed the button, watching the handsome face of her
          brother
          appear.
          "My darling Ayeka......."  He started.  She watched the
          whole
          hologram play and turned it off.
          "Lies.  All nothing but lies Yosho!"  She yelled and
          threw the
          projector against the door.  Her eyes filled with unshed
          tears, then
          she picked up her bo staff, stepping over the glass, and
          ran out of
          the room.  Unaware of Wufei leaning against the door.

                Wufei arched his eyebrow, wondering what that was
          all about
          and went into her room.  It was twice as big as his but
          he didn&#8217;t pay
          all that much attention to it.  His attention was
          focused on the
          broken glass on the floor.  He picked up the picture and
          studied it.
          Ayeka was standing besides a guy about his age.
          "My darling Ayeka......"  He heard, then glanced at the
          holographic
          image of yet another guy with long black hair.
