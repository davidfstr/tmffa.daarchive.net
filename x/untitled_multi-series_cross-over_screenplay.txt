=============================================================

1. INT. SHOT. FORENSICS LAB 4:45PM.

MED. SHOT OF DANA SCULLY AND VYVYAN STANDING OVER A
BODY. THERE IS A DUFFEL BAG BY VYVYAN.

                        SCULLY:
             Now, I take the scalpel like so, and
             make a small incision here, like so.

   We watch SCULLY MAKE AN INCISION IN THE CORPSE'S ARM. She is
   very careful and precise in doing so.

                        SCULLY:
              Now, let's see you do it.

    We watch VYVYAN REACH INTO HIS DUFFEL BAG and PULL OUT A
    CHAIN SAW.

SCULLY's eyes widen.

     As we continue to watch, VYVYAN LEANS OVER TO HOLD DOWN THE
     BODY and MAKES A CUT WITH HIS CHAIN SAW. When he STANDS UP,
     however, we see he is MISSING ONE ARM.

                        VYVYAN:
              Oh dear. Wrong arm. Um, would you
              happen to have a band-aid?

**************************************************************

2. EXT. SHOT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS.

LONG SHOT. THE CLEARING IS EMPTY.

    As we watch, a DRAIN APPEARS out of nowhere. VERY RAPIDLY, A
    CONICAL BATHTUB SPIRALS up OUT OF THE DRAIN in a most
    improbable manner. In the CONICAL BATHTUB we find FORD
    PREFECT with his SATCHEL draped over the side of the
 tub. FORD is SINGING.

                        FORD:
                      (singing)
                 Za! Za! Za heemooo...(1)

FORD STOPS SINGING
and PULLS his TOWEL
from his SATCHEL

                        FORD:
                  Hey! This isn't the bathroom!

FORD GETS DRESSED.

                         MULDER(OS):
                   Interesting place for a bath.

WE FOLLOW FORD'S GAZE as
he TURNS to face FOX MULDER
who has just arrived having
heard a strange noise.

                        FORD:
                How long have you been here?

                        MULDER:
                I just arrived. I heard a strange
                noise.

                        FORD:
                A strange noise?

                        MULDER:
                Yes, it sounded like...

MULDER DOES an IMPRESSION
of the SOUND OF a CONICAL
BATHTUB RAPIDLY SPIRALLING
UP OUT OF its OWN DRAIN.

                        FORD:
                Well, I didn't hear anything
                like that.

                        MULDER:
                 I see.

MULDER PULLS OUT his
ID and SHOWS IT to
FORD PREFECT

                        MULDER:
                  Fox Mulder. FBI. I'd like to
                  ask you a few question.

                        FORD:
                 Go right ahead. But not here.
                 Why don't we head on over to
                 the pub? I must be running low.
                 I'm starting to see FBI agents
                 instead of purple turtles...

MULDER NODS.

FORD and MULDER WALK
OFF-CAMERA

***************************************************************
3. EXT. SHOT

SAME CLEARING, TWO MINUTES LATER. MEDIUM SHOT.

    As we watch, CAPTAIN KIRK and MR. SPOCK are BEAMED
    DOWN.

SPOCK GOES OVER TO the
CONICAL TUB.

KIRK REMAINS WHERE HE IS

SPOCK EXAMINES the CONICAL
BATHTUB with his TRICORDER.

                     SPOCK:
                Fascinating. It appears to
                be a bathtub.

                     KIRK:
                Your powers of observation never
                cease to amaze me, Mr. Spock.

SPOCK GIVES A LITTLE
NOD.

                     SPOCK:
                Why thank you, Captain.

KIRK SCOWLS.

                      SPOCK:
                 Most curious.

KIRK JOINS SPOCK at
the CONICAL TUB.

                       KIRK:
                  What is it, Spock?

                       SPOCK:
                  This tub has been subected
                  to a power source that I am
                   not familiar with.

KIRK has a LOOK of
MOCK-AMAZEMENT on
his face.

                         KIRK:
                   You can't figure it out?
                   This bathtub must have an
                   extraodinary power supply.

SPOCK is now SCANNING
the OUTSIDE of the tub
with his TRICORDER

                         SPOCK:
                   I do not believe this bath
                   has what you would call a
                   power supply. It appears to
                   have been propelled her by
                   some means unknown to us.

SPOCK FINDS FORD'S
FOOTPRINTS FIRST, then
he FINDS MULDER'S

                         SPOCK:
                    Curious. There are two sets
                    of footprints here. However
                    only one set is travelling
                    in two directions. Apparently
                    whoever made the other set
                    must have arrived here in the
                    bath.

                          KIRK:
                     Well, Mr. Spock, you have to
                     admit it is a relaxing way
                     to travel.

                          SPOCK:
                      I strongly doubt Starfleet
                      Command will be switching
                      to Bathtub Class any time
                      soon.

                           KIRK:
                     Stranger things have happened
                     Mr. Spock.

                           SPOCK:
                          Such as.

KIRK get a BEMUSED
LOOK on his FACE.

                            KIRK:
                That's odd. I can't think of any.

                            ZAPHOD(OS):
                   How about talking monkeys?

KIRK and SPOCK TURN.
KIRK's JAW DROPS OPEN
and his EYES GO WIDE.
SPOCK RAISES an EYEBROW
and TILTS HIS HEAD in a
QUIZZICAL MANNER.

                            SPOCK:
                If you are referring to Captan
                Kirk and myself, then you are
                only half correct as I did not
                evolve from the simian life on
                this planet.

                             KIRK:
                        Gee, thanks, Spock.

KIRK TURNS to ADDRESS
ZAPHOD.

                             KIRK:
                           Mister...

                             ZAPHOD:
                   Beeblebrox. Zaphod Beeblebrox.

                              KIRK:
                    Mr. Beeblebrox. Can you explain
                    to me just how this bathtub got
                    in this field?

ZAPHOD BANGS his
HEADS TOGETHER.

                             ZAPHOD:
                    Sheesh, haven't you guys heard of
                    the Infinite Improbability Drive
                    yet? You know you are so incredibly
                    unhoopy.

KIRK and SPOCK
TRADE LOOKS

                             KIRK:
                    Infinite Improbability Drive?

                             SPOCK:
                    I presume you're referring to a
                    device which generates an improbability
                    field which in turn causes improbable
                    events to occur.

ZAPHOD NODS

                             KIRK:
                    And what happens at Infinite
                    Improbability level?

                             ZAPHOD:
                    The ship passes through every
                    point of every universe
                    simultaneously.

                              KIRK:
                    So all you need to do is pick
                    out your re-entry point.

                              SPOCK:
                    I assume the bath was the result
                    of one of the finite improbability
                    generations produced as the ship
                    slowed to what I shall refer to as
                    Normality Speed?

                             ZAPHOD:
                    Yep. Hey, why don't we contninue
                    this little chat at the pub. My
                    semi-cousin probably went there.

                             SPOCK:
                    I assume your semi-cousin enjoys
                    consuming alcoholic beverages.

                             ZAPHOD
                     He sure does. Come on, I need a
                     drink. Two actually.

ZAPHOD PUTS his
THREE ARMS around
KIRK and SPOCK and
LEADS them OFF_CAMERA

4. EXT

A DARK ALLEY. 11:39 PM

MED TO LONG SHOT of
OPERATIVE A LEANING on
a WALL. OPERATIVE A is
IN DISGUISE and WEARING
a TRENCHCOAT and FEDORA.

MULDER WALKS BY the
ALLEY with FORD.

                             FORD:
                     Are you sure there's a pub
                     here?

                             MULDER:
                      Just up the road a ways.

OPERATIVE A STEPS OUT
of the ALLEY and FOLLOWS
FORD and MULDER.

5. INT. SHOT. A PUB

We are in A PUB. As we watch FORD and MULDER WALK IN
and SIT at the BAR.  A few moments later, OPERATIVE-A
WALKS IN and SITS in a BOOTH

                           FORD:
                         Bartender!

FORD RAISES HIS HAND
and WHISTLES.

BARTENDER is POURING
DRINKS from the TAP.

                           BARTENDER:
                       Good evening, gentlemen.
                       How may I help you?

                           FORD:
                       I'll have a gin and tonic.

                           MULDER:
                        Ginger Ale.

                           BARTENDER:
                       Designated driver?

                           MULDER:
                       Actually, we walked.

BARTENDENDER MAKES
and SERVES FORD'S
and MULDER'S DRINKS

FORD RAISES HIS GLASS

                           FORD:
                        TO TOWELS!

FORD MAKES a TOASTING
MOTION with his DRINK
and then SWALLOWS the
WHOLE DRINK in one GULP.

A WAITRESS GOES OVER to
OPERATIVE-A'S TABLE.

                           WAITRESS
                        What would you like?

OPERATIVE A LOOKS UP.

                           OPERATIVE A:
                         What would you suggest?

WAITRESS LOOKS CAREFULLY
AT OPERATIVE A

                           WAITRESS:
                         For you? I'd suggest a
                         vodka martini...shaken
                         not stirred.

                           OPERATIVE A:
                          Hmm. Okay, I'll try

                           MULDER:

EMPTY BOOTH.

                           WAITRESS:

6. INT. SHOT.  FORENSICS LAB MANY HOURS LATER.

We are back in the FORENSICS LAB with SCULLY and VYV.
VYV MIRACULOUSLY HAS BOTH OF HIS ARMS ATTACHED NOW.
THERE is a PILE of SEVERED LIMBS NEXT TO VYV and another
pile of CONFISCATED CUTTING TOOLS NEXT TO SCULLY.

                           SCULLY:
                         Okay. Let's try it again.
                         This time with a *scalpel"

VYV SMACKS his
FOREHEAD.

                            VYV:
                          Oh, is that what scalpels
                          are for? I thought they were
                          for cutting meat into really
                          thin slices.

                             MAX HEADROOM(OS):
                           Yes! Yes! Its the all new
                           Zik Zak kitchen scalpel!

VYV and SCULLY
TURN and SEE MAX
HEADROOM on a
SECURITY MONITOR

                              SCULLY:
                             Who are you?

MAX HEADROOM
MOVES SPORADICALLY
around the SCREEN

                             MAX HEADROOM:
                            Hi! I'm Max Max Max
                            Headroom. Coming to-to

                             VYV:
                            Uh... you're created by
                            a computer, right?

                             MAX:
                            Mm HMMM.

VYV RAISES a FINGER
LIKE A LECTURER

                             VYV:
                            Then how can you be *live*
                            and direct?

MAX GETS a PUZZLED
LOOK on his FACE. HE
LEAVES the SCREEN,
presumably to GO and
THINK ABOUT THIS.

                             SCULLY:
                            Okay, let's try it again.

CUT TO JERSEY BILOWSKI, STANDING
ALONE in his USUAL HAT AND SUIT
in the HALL outside the LAB.

                             JERSEY:
                        You know, that lad in there.
                        Bloody brilliant. Oh yeah. Just
                        the other day, I asked him "Where's
                        my hat, on account of the fact
                        that I couldn't find it. And he says on
                        top of my bloody head.
                               (beat)
      He was bloomin' right, ya know! Well...
                        back to the action...

CUT BACK to SCULLY and VYV.

SCULLY'S CELLPHONE RINGS

SCULLY PICKS UP the

                             (beat)
                            Mulder where...
                             (beat)
                            What are
                            you doing in the pub?
                             (beat)
                            Hold on

SCULLY CHECKS a
FEW DATABASES.

                              SCULLY:
                             Mulder?
                               (beat)
                             Yeah.
                               (beat)
                             No, we don't have any agents
                             in the field that our
                             investigations would put in
                             serious risk.
                               (beat)
                             Look, Mulder why don't you
                             track down this guy.

SCULLY GETS a
STRANGE LOOK on
HER FACE

                               SCULLY:
                             We *ARE* the FBI!

SCULLY HANGS UP.

SCULLY GETS ANOTHER
DEAD BODY and REMOVES
the SHEET FROM IT'S
FACE. THE CORPSE is a
YOUNG MAN with a VERY
STRANGE HAIRSTYLE.

VYV PICKS UP a
CHAINSAW and CUTS OFF
THE CORPSE'S ARM.

THE CORPSE GRABS VYV
WITH HIS REMAINING ARM.

VYV THROWS the CHAINSAW
BACK over his HEAD when
he THROWS UP his ARMS in
SHOCK.

SCULLY DUCKS

THE CORPSE STANDS UP,
PICKS UP his SEVERED ARM
AND HOLDS it to the STUMP
which it RE-FUSES to.

THE CORPSE FLEXES HIS ARM.

                               KAI:
                            Ah. Much better.

                               SCULLY:
                            Who are you?

                               KAI:
                            I am Kai. Last of the
                            Brunnen-G.
