CHAPTER 1-Minako’s Love Crystal

‘Dear Diary,’ Usagi wrote.
‘Guess what? Rei-chan came over and said Ohhhhh Staaaaaaaaary
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiight! She sang very horrible. Minako-chan was great today. And
Mako-chan baked the best cookies ever.’

   Makato was walking to Usagi’s house but changed her mind when she passed
Seiya, Yaten and Taiki’s house. She knocked on the door and Seiya answered.
“Hi Seiya!” she greeted. “I’m going to Usagi’s house, wanna come?”
“SURE!” Seiya replied.
“Who is it Seiya?” Taiki called from the living room. He walked through the
door.
 “ Oh hey Makato!” he said. Yaten bounded in.
“ I wanna come, too!” he exclaimed.
   So the four of them walked to Usagi’s house. Seiya knocked on the door.
Rei answered
“MAKOOOOOOO!!!! YOU ARE SOOOOO LATE!!!!!” she exclaimed.
   Makato saw Minako running.
“Well, Minako-chan is WAAAAY later than me!”
Minako ran into the house.
“Come in!” Usagi said cheerfully^.^
“Meatball head! They can’t come in!” Rei exclaimed.
“Why not?”
“Because of our girl meeting!”
“Whatreya talkin’ ‘bout? I invited you guys for dinner.”
“And a sleepover, too, STUPID!”
“Um.. It’s okay, we can leave,” Seiya cut in. Ikkuko came in.
“Oh hi boys! Just in time for the sleepover! ^.^”
****************** Usagi’s Bedroom *********************
“Gee, Usagi-chan. I’m surprised that you can actually keep your room clean
but when you’re at my house, you leave a complete mess!” Rei shouted in
Usagi’s face.
“WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”
“Oh, SHUT UP!”
Seiya tried very hard not to laugh. Makato lay on Usagi’s bed, giggling.
“ Really, you guys, please be quiet. I’m doing my homework.” No one heard
Ami.
“BE QUIET!” Ami shouted.
Hotaru and Setsuna watched the scene quietly.
“Setsuna-mama?”
“Yes Hotaru-chan?”
“Why does Minako-chan look so pale?” Everyone turned to Minako and saw that
she was lying on the floor with her love crystal hanging above.
“Minako-chan!” Usagi cried. Seiya secretly took the crystal and put it in
his pocket.
“Ami-chan! Take a scan now!” Usagi ordered Ami.
“Right!” Ami toyed with her mini computer. ”I have strong readings. The
Negaverse is behind this, I can tell.”
“ I call upon the power of mars… FIREBALLS CHARGE!” Rei exclaimed.
“ Ehe… Rei-chan, what the heck are ya tryin ta do?” Makato asked Rei.
“I’m trying to get rid of the evil spirits!” Seiya was definitely confused.
Why were the girls playing Sailor Moon? He motioned for Taiki and Yaten to
leave.

Chapter 2-Usagi’s Surprise

Usagi called Mamoru on the phone. His answer machine did the job.
‘Hello Mamoru here. Sorry, I’m in the United States right now attending
collage. Please call me at (616) –555– 5555. Thank you!”
        Usagi dialed the number.
“Hello? Steve here.”
“Mamoru!”
“Who are you?”
“WHERE IS MAMORU!?!?”
*In a muffled voice* “I thinks it’s for you, Mamoru”
“Hello? Mamoru speaking.”
“WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE GOING TO U.S.A.?”
“Um…. Who is this?”
“Mamoru! It’s Usagi!”
“Oh… um hi Usagi. Look I really gotta go. Seeya, ok? Bye bye.” Usagi was
shocked. ‘Isn’t Mamoru glad to hear from me?’ she thought.
**************Seiya’s, Taiki’s and Yaten’s house*********

         Yaten was unusually quiet.
“Yaten, whatsa matter?” Taiki asked.
“Notin.” Taiki was puzzled.
“Are-“ Then he figured it out. Yaten cared for Minako. When her love crystal
was gone, she would die.
“Is it… Minako?” Yaten faked a laugh.
“Ha ha ha! Nothing is wrong with me hahaha!”
“Riiiiiight. Really. Uh huh.”
        “Hey, Seiya! Lemme check out da crystal!” Yaten shouted. He
pretended to take a long time. His friends left. Making sure no one was
around, he put the love crystal in his pocket.

Chapter 3-The meeting

“Ryouko!” Tenchi called. “Where are you?” Tenchi was looking for Ryouko,
because he needed help on the carrot field. Tenchi thought for a moment. “Ah
hah! I bet I know where she is!” He ran to the lake in the middle of the
forest and saw Ryouko sitting under his grandfather Yosho’s space ship tree
majiggy. She was talking with Sasami and Ryo-Ohki.
“Sasami! Guess what? I have tickets to go to Tokyo; it’s going to be soooooo
fun! It’s a present for Tenchi!” Sasami’s bright face turned gloomy.
“It’s only for Tenchi?” she asked.
“Oh, no! It’s for all of us. I meant that one ticket was for him!”
“Oh, Great! I can prepare the food! Do you wanna help Ryouko?”
“Ok, C’ mon let’s go!” Tenchi just reached them. “There you are, Ryouko,” he
said. “I need help on the carrot field.”
“Um…” Ryouko began. “I’m sorry Tenchi. I gotta help Sasami prepare lunch!”
‘Huh?’ Tenchi thought. ‘Ryouko preparing lunch?’

********************* Kiyone Makibi *********************

        I was taking a walk down the lovely streets of Tokyo. The others
told me to find a place to stay. Something spotted my eyes. It was a temple.
The best place to stay. I started to run up the steps, but a thought came to
me. Don’t you need to pay to stay? Oh well, Here goes!
“Excuse me, ma’am?” I said to the temple priestess.
“Hi, My name is Kiyone Makibi, My friends and I are looking for a place to
stay and I was wondering if we could stay here.”
“ If you don’t have money to pay, you need to work for a week.” She told me.
“How many people are coming?”
“Um… Tenchi, Yosho, Noboyuki, Washuu, Ryouko, Sasami, Aeka, Mihoshi, Sakuya
and myself which equals…. 10!”
*********************** Aeka Jurai ***********************

        I have good news, and bad.  Good news: Ryouko gave us tickets to
Tokyo. Kiyone found us a place to stay. Bad news: we have to work for the
pay for a week. That wretched, little, brat Sakuya is coming along. We just
met her, and she’s already flirting with Tenchi. How dare she?
        Anyway, we met the priestess and her friends. Tenchi didn’t seem to
keep his eyes off the girl with long, blonde hair tied up with a bow. I
should keep an eye on her.
”Well, I’m Rei,” the priestess said. Then she introduced her friends. “
Usagi is the meatball headed klutz, Ami the intelligent genius, Makato the
strong fighter and Minako, the crazy mall shopper. Hope you enjoy your
stay!” Rei handed us our temple robes.
“Excuse me!” I shouted. “I am NOT wearing some dirty old temple rag, you
poor, pathetic fool!”
************************* Rei Hino **********************

The guest I had insulted me. I tried to control my self, but I couldn’t.
“What did you just call me?”
“Oh, you heard me!”
“You spoiled, dirty, rude, pathetic BRAT! Who cares if you don’t want to
wear that! You can’t always go around wearing cheap kimonos!” With that, I
turned away.
“She’s got a point, there” I heard Sakuya Kumashiro
 say. When I reached my room, I burst into tears. ‘Why is everyone always
saying bad things about me?’ I thought. ‘Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?’
        I took all my feelings and wrote it in my diary. I wrote how I
really think Usagi’s better than me. How I felt when Yuuchiro almost left.
When I found out that Mamoru and Usagi were destined to be together. When I
found out my father didn’t like me. When that Aeka Jurai insulted me. I
wrote that the world would be better without me. I wrote my feelings for
Yuuchiro. I wrote how jealous over Usagi. How I long to be just like her.
How I became Sailor Mars.
        I close my diary and began to think. ‘Phobias, Debios? Can you hear
me?’ My two crows turned to the magical fairies they once were.
“Yes, Princess Rei?” they answered me.
“What would happen if I were Sailor Moon, and Usagi Mars. Would my life be
better, or just the same? Please tell me.”

Chapter 4 – A Misunderstanding

*******************Tenchi Masaki ************************

She was just beautiful. Minako Aino. A name that suits her. I caught her
hand just as she was about to leave.
‘Excuse me, Minako? My name is Tenchi, I’m new here.”
“Oh you’re the guy that Rei told us about!”
“Can you give me a tour about Tokyo, please?”
“Sure!” We walked about a block and stopped.
“This is my favorite place to go. It reminds me of home.”
        We walked in Tokyo Flower Park. It was certainly beautiful. Reminded
me of the temple back in Okayama.
“Can I ask you a question?” I asked. Minako nodded.
“Um… Why exactly does this remind you of home?”
   Minako looked down. “I… I can’t exactly tell you.” She stumbled for the
right words.
“Oh.”
“Tenchi! There you are!” I looked back and saw Sakuya.
“Oh hi Sakuya. How are you?”
“I’m great, Tenchi! Come on, I wanna eat dinner with you!” Sakuya completely
ignored Minako. She pulled me away from her.
"Who are you?" questioned Minako to Sakuya.
"Me? Oh, I'm Tenchi's girlfriend! Now hurry up Tenchi!"
   I saw Minako looking hurt and shocked at the same time. Then she ran off.
********************* Minako Aino ***********************

“Aretimis, why do all the guys I like are taken? I just met a cute guy
today, and his girlfriend just came and dragged him away from me.”
“Minako, you’ll find that special someone someday.”
“But when? My knight in shining armor is never going to rescues me!”
I burst into tears. Tenchi Masaki was the best guy I ever met. His
girlfriend is very lucky to have him.
“Minako I have a present for you!” Aretimis said excitedly. I looked up and
saw him in armor, carrying something.
“Your homework is finished, for I am your knight in shining armor.”
   I laughed. Then I sighed, a little.
“Thanks Aretimis. But I’d like to be alone right now.”
“Are you sure, Minako?”
“Mmm-hmmm.”
"Ok, seeya. Hmmmmmm, I wonder what your mother put in my food tray.”
I started thinking, but I fell asleep. I had a nightmare. I was on a date
with Tenchi, but instead of me it was Sakuya. I woke up all hot and sweaty.

   I don't own Tenchi Muyo or Sailor Moon characters. This is just a fic.
Make beleive. I made up just events. Please don't sue me if any of these
acts offend you. Thanks.
