          Prologue

               Ryoko was about to sit down in the living room with
          the others
          when she began to sense that someone she knew was
          nearby. She went outside and noticed that everything was
          calm, too
          calm. The water at the center of the lake began to
          ripple,
          but not as it would when the wind blew over it. It was
          rippling as if
          someone had tossed a pebble into it.
               Someone began to, slowly but surely, fade into view
          over the
          ripples. Whoever it was had fiery red, neck length hair,
          large,
          black, bat-like wings, and a dragon tail that was the
          same colour as
          his wings.
               When the person had come into full view, Ryoko
          could see the
          person clearly. The person had long legs, meaning he was

          tall, and was dressed in faded, baggy blue jeans, black
          sneakers, and
          a sleeveless, black shirt. Tied near the person's waist
          was
          a long, curved, gleaming sword and around his neck was a
          pair of
          aviation goggles.
               Ryoko narrowed her eyes at the person. "Hwoarang,"
               Hwoarang smirked at Ryoko, his wings disappeared.
          He
          disappeared and reappeared beside her. "Still mad about
          my
          betraying you?"
               "I escaped anyway,"
               "Your escaping is what brought me here, Odin told
          me you'd be
          here and why. He said you were being flirty with some
          guy
          named Tenchi who likes you but only as a friend. Am I
          correct?"
               Ryoko didn't answer, she turned and walked back
          into the house,
          her face a light pink from what Hwoarang had just said.
               Hwoarang followed Ryoko and stopped when she had
          shut the door
          in his face. Hwoarang smiled and walked through the
          door in the same ghost-like manner as Ryoko.
               In the living room, everyone's head turned from the
          T.V. to
          Hwoarang. Sasami was the first to say and do something.
               "Sir Hwoarang, how'd you get here?!" Sasami said as
          she ran
          over to Hwoarang and hugged him.
               "I just teleported here from the Demon Hunter H.Q.
          in
          Dragonia," Hwoarang said.
               "For what reason?" asked Ayeka, who had been
          walking down the
          stairs.
               "To bring a certain someone back with me," Hwoarang
          glanced at
          Ryoko.
               "Well, if you're talking about Ryoko, then go ahead
          and take
          her back to H.Q. immediately! She is such a pest! And
          she
          always messing with Lord Tenchi's head!"
               "No she's just flirting with him to the point where
          he'd want
          to get her away from him with a cattle prod,"
               Ryoko's face went from pink to bright red.
               Hwoarang chuckled. "Why ya gettin' embarrassed
          about it now?
          You seemed to have no problem flirting with Tenchi in
          front of the others,"
               "Just shut up!" snapped Ryoko, hiding her face.
               "Well, I gotta go now, Odin's waiting for me to
          come back with
          Ryoko so he can give her a special 'present'. Goodbye
          Mihoshi and Kiyone, keep up the good work with the
          GP.(Whatever you
          consider good work.) See ya, Sasami, next time I'll
          come back with a present for you and your sister. And
          last, but not
          least, Ayeka. Goodbye, Ayeka, enjoy your now
          Ryoko-free life,"
               "Goodbye, Hwoarang," Ayeka said as she kissed
          Hwoarang's cheek,
          then hugged him. "Be careful on your assignments,"
               "I will,"
               In a flash of blue light, Hwoarang and Ryoko had
          disappeared
          from the living room.

               On the sister planet of Jurai or Dragonia, Hwoarang
          dragged a
          now immobile Ryoko behind him as he walked into Demon
          Hunter H.Q.
               "So, its Ryoko again for you, eh, Hwoarang?" said
          Hwoarang's
          friend Takeshi Kagata, who was a demon hunter who
          hunted in another galaxy.
               "Yeah," said Hwoarang. "And this time its for good
          since
          Ryoko's getting 'the present' from Odin himself,"
               Takeshi chuckled. He looked down at Ryoko. "See ya
          in the funny
          paper's, Ryoko,"
               "Yeah, yeah," Ryoko mumbled.
               Hwoarang turned down a long corridor and walked to
          the elevator
          at the end of the hall. He pressed the 'Up' button and
          the
          elevator immediately opened. He stepped in and yanked
          Ryoko just as
          the elevator doors closed and nearly caught her foot.
               Hwoarang sighed after he pushed the button the 101
          floor(H.Q.
          has a lot of floors doesn't it?). He lifted Ryoko into
          his
          arms.
               Ryoko blushed slightly.
               Hwoarang saw this. "Don't think that I'm getting
          all lovey-
          dovey or anything,"
               "I'm not," Ryoko said.
               Ryoko moved her now mobile arms a little. She
          looked up to see
          that the elevator was only on the tenth floor. "Man,
          this
          elevator is slow,"
               "I know, but it can't be fixed,"
               Ryoko turned her head a little so she could look up
          at
          Hwoarang. She smiled.
               Hwoarang looked down at her. "What?"
               "Nothing, just remembering the good times we had
          together
          before you became a Demon Hunter,"
               "Oh really? Now seems like a good time to remember
          that kinda
          stuff since you're gonna get 'the present' from Odin,"
               Ryoko sighed and rested her head against Hwoarang's
          arm. She
          giggled when she felt his arm become tense.
               "You remember that time when we were on Sonja and
          you robbed
          the National Bank?"
               "Yeah. They didn't even know I had cleaned the
          vault out until
          it was too late,"
               "How'd you pull off something like that?"
               "You mean you didn't see me? Oh, yeah, you
          couldn't. I had made
          myself, the sack I was carrying, and the money
          invisible.
          So I just went straight through the door of the vault
          and got all the
          moolah,"
               "Those where the good ol' days. We got along well
          then, but
          then you betrayed me, you became a Demon Hunter without
          telling me, so I had to figure what you had done and why
          while I
          spent ten hours in a cell before escaping. I was really
          crushed
          by what you did. I had thought I could trust you but I
          was wrong,"
               Ryoko's eyes began to fill with tears. "I was
          heartbroken after
          that because I was in love with you at the time, but too
          afraid
          to tell you,"
               Hwoarang let Ryoko, who was now completely mobile,
          stand on her
          own and although he found this strange, he embraced
          Ryoko.
               "I'm sorry, Ryoko," he said. "I can't change the
          past and I had
          to turn you in, otherwise I would be executed for
          disobeying
          the commands of the Master of Demon Hunters,"
               Ryoko buried her face in Hwoarang's shoulder and
          cried.
               Hwoarang looked up and sighed. The elevator had
          just passed the
          30th floor.
               After about ten minutes of crying, Ryoko calmed
          down. She
          sniffled and sat in one of the corners of the elevators.

               "Sorry about getting all emotional just then,"
          Ryoko said as
          she wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her blue and
          yellow
          striped dress.(Is it a dress or a smock? I'm not sure)
          "Its just that
          with the memories of good times come bad times. And your

          betrayal and turning me in was the worst time, in fact,
          its the only
          bad time I can remember now,"
               Hwoarang, who had sat in the corner diagonal to
          Ryoko's, began
          to regret ever becoming a Demon Hunter.
               "Like I said, Ryoko," he said. "I'm sorry. I
          would've been
          killed if I hadn't turned you in, so I picked what I
          considered the
          worst of my two choices: Turning you in. I shouldn't
          have become a
          Demon Hunter. Odin allowed me to join because he
          thought my reason was good: To avenge the death of my
          master, Baek
          Doo San, by finding the demon who killed him, bring it
          to H.Q., and seal it away in dead dimension for all
          eternity. But I
          got my revenge by defeating the demon in the third
          Ironfist
          Tournament, but I wanted to do more, to make him suffer
          for killing
          Master Baek. None of this would've happened if I hadn't
          become a Demon Hunter, you wouldn't be on your way to
          have the same
          fate that that demon might have when I find him, we'd
          probably be robbing the Dragonia National Bank again!"
               Hwoarang clenched his trembling hands into fists
          and slammed
          them against the tile floor of the elevator.
               The elevator stopped for a few minutes then started
          moving
          again.
               Ryoko watched as Hwoarang trembled with anger, his
          eyes, which
          were the same colour as hers, were filled with the anger

          built up by what he had just said.
               Hwoarang closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
          The end of his
          tail was patting against the floor in the corner next to
          the
          one he was sitting in.
               Ryoko disappeared and reappeared beside Hwoarang.
          She rested
          her head on his shoulder.
               "Your words surprised me, Hwoarang," she said. "I
          never seen or
          heard as emotional as you were just then,"
               "Sorta surprised myself," Hwoarang said. "I didn't
          think I'd be
          gettin' emotional around you, and at a time like this. I
          guess
          your emotions changed me now. Now I'm gonna be mopin'
          around after
          Odin's finished you. Hell, there'd be no more reason to
          be a Demon Hunter, beside finding the demon that killed
          my master.
          *sigh* It just wouldn't be the same to know that you
          wouldn't be reeking anymore havoc,"
               Ryoko looked up at Hwoarang and turned his head so
          that she was
          looking at her.
               "Y'know, I always dreamed for an opportunity like
          this to come
          along. And well, its right here, screaming in my face
          'Make
          your wish come true already, before you're sealed away!"
          So, here's
          my wish,"
               Ryoko kissed Hwoarang. She giggled when his eyes
          widened. Ryoko
          took he lips off of Hwoarang's and smiled.
               "I'm sorry," she said. "Did I surprise you? I
          thought you
          would've figured out what my wish was right away,"
               "Well, I thought it was something, but I didn't
          think it was to
          kiss me," Hwoarang said.
               "What did you think it was?"
               "To rip me to pieces for betraying you,"
               "No! I was, well, still am in love with you, and I
          will always
          will be, even when I'm sealed in that dead dimension you
          were
          talking about,"
               Ryoko and Hwoarang looked into each other's eyes
          and embraced
          each other.
               A bell dinged and the doors of the elevator opened.

               Hwoarang and Ryoko looked up to see that the
          elevator had
          reached it's destination: the 101st floor.
               "Well, you know what's gonna happen now, don't
          you?" Hwoarang
          said as he and Ryoko stood up.
               "Yeah," Ryoko said.
               "Let's go,"
               Hwoarang and Ryoko walked out of the elevator and
          down a long,
          dimly lit, doorless corridor. They came to a large oak
          door that had an image of  who Ryoko figured was Odin on
          a strangely
          marked horse. Hwoarang knocked on the door.
               "Come in," a deep voice said from behind the doors.

               Hwoarang opened the door and he and Ryoko walked
          into a room
          that had looked as if it was made entirely of glass, and

          had an amazing view of Saturn and Venus?!
               "How high does the H.Q. go?!" Ryoko asked Hwoarang.

               "Two miles high, but Odin's office is in outer
          space and the
          door we just walked through was a portal from the H.Q.
          to
          here," Hwoarang said.
               "Hwoarang, Ryoko, what took you so long?" said the
          voice of
          Odin.
               Odin, who was about the same height as Hwoarang
          stood in the
          center of the office. He had ankle length, silver hair
          that
          was braided into a ponytail. He was dressed in a long,
          white, silk
          shirt that had a tail and sleeves that stopped at his
          calves, and
          matching silk pants that were incredibly baggy and hid
          his feet
          completely.
               Odin turned to face Hwoarang and Ryoko. He looked
          from Hwoarang
          to Ryoko with his lively, grey eyes and smiled.
               "So you made your wish come true before you got
          what the D.H.s
          (Demon Hunters, what else?) call 'the present' from me,
          eh, Ryoko?" Odin asked.
               Ryoko flushed bright red and looked down at her
          feet.
               "I don't blame you. I probably would've done
          something similar,
          but I don't have to, because I didn't have a past like
          yours.
          If I did I wouldn't be here today," Odin paused. "Well,
          I might as
          well get this over with,"
               Odin snapped his hidden fingers and a vortex to the
          dead
          dimension that Hwoarang had spoken of opened on the
          floor
          beside Odin's hidden feet.
               Hwoarang looked at Ryoko.
               She looked at him with once again, watering eyes.
               "Goodbye, Hwoarang," she said. "Remember what I
          said: 'I will
          always be in love with you, even in the dead dimension,"

               Ryoko slowly walked towards the vortex, wiping away
          the tears
          that rolled down her cheeks.
               Hwoarang watched as Ryoko walked towards the
          vortex, then
          remembered a promise they had made four years ago.

               Hwoarang looked at Ryoko as she quickly ate her
          fried noodles.
          He smiled.
               "Hey, Ryoko," Hwoarang said.
               "Yeah," Ryoko said after swallowing the noodles she
          had just
          stuffed into her mouth.
               "I want you to promise me this: To stick with me
          through thick
          and thin, to help me in times of distress, and to give
          me your
          trust,"
               Ryoko was silent for a few seconds. "Alright, I
          promise, but
          you gotta make that promise, too,"
               "Alright, I promise,"
               "Now, let's get back to eatin',"
               "Alrighty, then,"

               Hwoarang looked down at his sneakered feet.
               "I broke that promise," he thought. "Sure, I stuck
          with her
          through thick and thin, I helped her in times of
          distress, but I took
          her trust and threw it away when I became a D.H. with
          out telling
          her,"
               Hwoarang looked up to see that Ryoko was a foot and
          a half from
          plunging into the dead dimension.
               "No.....I can't let her fall into that dimension,"
          Hwoarang
          thought. "Not after hearing her pour out the fact that
          she's in love
          with me, not after breaking a promise that I have to
          piece back
          together. I'm sorry, Odin, but I gotta do this. Even if
          it means
          having to end my life!"
               Hwoarang's wings came out and he flew towards
          Ryoko. Just as
          she was about to fall into the vortex, he caught her by
          her
          wrist and flew *through* the glass of Odin's
          office.(*through*
          meaning in the ghost-like way)
               Odin watched as Hwoarang and Ryoko flew away. He
          smiled and
          shook his head.
               "I know why you did that, Hwoarang," Odin said.
          "But even
          though you are the Head Demon Hunter of the Milk Way
          Galaxy Unit and my best friend, I must do what is right
          and stop you.
          But don't worry, I won't kill you or Ryoko,"
               Odin snapped his fingers and the vortex closed. He
          disappeared
          and reappeared at the intercom control behind his desk.
          He flicked one of the switches labelled "All Intercoms".
               Odin put a hand on his forehead, sighed, and spoke.
               "Attention all D.H.'s.......that includes you
          Takeshi......Thank you. Now, listen closely so you won't
          miss
          anything. As you
          know, the most wanted demon and space pirate, Ryoko, was
          brought in
          by H.D.H. Hwoarang Hagiwara. Well, now you must
          hunt him down along with Ryoko and make sure you treat
          Hwoarang as if
          he were Ryoko, but make sure not to do one thing,
          and that is kill them. If any of you do, you're dead,
          literally, and
          you all know that. So, all D.H.s who cannot breathe in
          outer space, you all know to get in your spaceships,
          D.H.s who can
          breathe in space, which is basically the rest of you
          all, have
          your weapons ready and your energy powered up to
          maximum. Make sure
          to use as much force as possible without killing
          Hwoarang and Ryoko. I will be monitoring and aiding all
          of you in my
          ship, Sleipner. This is M.O.D.H. Odin, signing off,"
               Odin flicked the switch off and left he's room for
          the star
          dock of H.Q. ships.

               "Hwoarang, why are you doing this?" Ryoko asked as
          she flew
          beside Hwoarang. "Don't you know you could be killed for

          doing this?!"
               "Yeah, but I know Odin, he wouldn't kill me,"
          Hwoarang
          said. "Not even if you offered him all the money in the
          universe,"
               Hwoarang stopped flying and turned to look behind
          him.
               "Their coming..." he said.
               "You'll have to fight 'em off, so I'm gonna help-"
               "No. You fly on ahead, Odin might want you dead,"
               "But-"
               "Go. Now, Ryoko,"
               Ryoko stared at Hwoarang for a second. She took a
          deep
          breath. "No, I don't care if I live or die, I'm gonna
          help you,"
               "Fine, then, but it won't be my fault if you end up
          half dead,"
                "Whatever,"
               Hwoarang and Ryoko prepared for the battle that was
          beginning
          to appear in the distance.

               Odin set Sleipner on auto pilot. He could sense
          that Hwoarang
          and Ryoko were waiting for him and all of the D.H.s.
               "Why did you have to do this, Hwoarang?" he
          thought.
               Odin was startled by an explosion. He looked up to
          see one of
          the H.Q. ships transformed into a flaming disaster. He
          sighed and sat at the ship console. He armed all of
          Sleipner's
          weapons and powered them up to half their maximum power
          and
          put up the shields. Odin frowned.
               "Even though you arm my friend, Hwoarang, I have to
          do this,"
          Odin said.
               He opened a view screen to all of the H.Q. ships.
               "Alright, on my word, begin to fire all of your
          weapons at half
          of their maximum power."
               Odin closed his eyes and was silent for a few
          minutes. He
          opened his eyes.
               "Fire!"
