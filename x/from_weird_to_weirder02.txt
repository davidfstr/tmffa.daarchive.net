This is the standard disclaimer that all fanfics 
get. The characters of Ranma ½ belong to Rumiko 
Takakashi. The characters of Sailor Moon belong to 
Naoko Takeuchi. This is all for non-profit reasons, 
so please don't sue me. I don't have enough to make 
it worth while anyway. And now on with the story. 

Note: I know Ranma is acting out of character. The 
reasons why will be explained in memories and flashbacks 
throughout the story. Also, in this story I'm throwing all 
of the Inner Senshi into Juuban high.   They are all the 
same age as Ranma, about 17.  Tomas is 19, but has been 
out of school since his parents' death, about two years, 
so he is in the same grade as Ranma.  I'm also making 
Hotaru 15 in this, but she goes to a different school.  
This is an alternate Sailor Moon universe, bet the changes 
are pretty much in age.  In the Ranma Time-line it is about 
14 months after the bombed wedding.  This is NOT an SI fic.

Chapter 2: School Daze

	Nodaka awoke from her peaceful sleep to the sound 
of fighting.  At first she was wondering what type of maniacs 
would be getting into a brawl at six in the morning.  Deciding 
that it would be best to check on the matter before calling 
the police, she got out of bed, put on her kimono, and headed 
towards the stairs.  It was at this point that she recalled 
that her son had finally come home, and rushed to the backyard, 
fearing the worst.  What she saw however left her in a total 
shock.  

	There was her son, Ranma, in a fight of unspeakable 
proportions with Tomas, his best friend.  The fight, however, 
was only unspeakable if you had never seen these two spar 
before.  The two young men were moving so fast that at times 
it seemed that their bodies blurred. Their hands and feet were 
blurring constantly, achieving speeds that Ranma would have 
thought possible only with the Armagurikan a year before.  The 
battle between the two raged all over the yard.  It soon took 
them near the kio pond and *SPLASH* the two of them landed in.  
At this point Nodaka decided to get them to clean up for school.

	"Boys, that's enough playing around.  You've both got 
to get into the shower and clean up.  School starts at 8:30 and 
you don't want to be late on your first day.    You'll find your 
uniforms on your beds.  Go get cleaned up now, and I'll start on 
breakfast."  With that she turned and headed into the house 
humming to herself.  It was good to have her son back.

	Ranma and Tomas blinked at each other for a minuet or 
so in total silence.  Tomas broke it with a simple statement.  
"Ah kuso, not school!  I haven't been there in years.  I don't 
want to start again."

	"Well tough.  If I've got to suffer, so do you.  Besides, 
since you dropped out we're in the same grade so its not like we 
won't see each other.  If we're lucky, we'll be in the same class.  
Come on, let's get cleaned up.  There's no avoiding it."

	"I know, but after two years its going to be hard to get 
used to studding again.  I'll give her school, but there is no way 
that I'm putting on any uniform.  I don't care what school policies 
are, there is no way that they will get me into one of those things.  
How 'bout you?"  

	"I can't disappoint mom.  I haven't seen her in ten years 
after all.  I guess I'll give the uniform a shot.  This isn't Nerima 
so I shouldn't have to worry about any fights.  A uniform couldn't 
kill me.  And if I don't like it, I can switch back tomorrow."

	"Sure, whatever, lets hit the shower.  I want to get cleaned 
up for the first day.  Got to impress the ladies you know."  The two 
young men (or better young man and young woman)  headed to the bathroom 
to get cleaned up.

********************************************************************************************

	As Ranma and Tomas walked to school in their normal clothing, 
they continued the discussion that they were having before called to 
breakfast.

	"I can't believe that she got you a girls uniform.  She actually 
expected you to go in your cursed form.  That has got to be one of the 
funniest things that I have ever heard!"  Tomas was breaking up.  He 
couldn't believe it when he told him about it.  Then listening to him 
tell his mother that he wouldn't were the uniform was even better.  
Thankfully she relented and they were off.

	"Get over it Tomas!  Its NOT that funny!"  Ranma was getting 
ticked off.  Here was his best friend and he was laughing at him.

	"Sure it is.  But ... okay I'm sorry.  I'll try to stay under 
control.  Come on, lets use the fence.  We need to get in our balancing 
practice."  The two of them hopped on the fence and continued on to school.

	A few minuets later Tomas looked back at Ranma and started a new 
conversation.  "So, Ranma, what do you know about the Juuban district?  
You never got around to telling me anything about this place."

	"Its got a reputation for strangeness.  Almost as bad as Nerima 
sometimes.  I've seen things in the news about monsters and girls in short 
skirts who fight them.  Personally, I think it's just a news prank or 
publicity stunt.  The monsters are among the goofiest things I've ever 
heard of."

	"Well then, maybe we should give them a little taste of what we're 
made of.  Imagine its surprise if we hit it with some ki blasts.  It would 
certainly be different from girls in skirts."  All of a sudden Tomas leapt 
into the air landing on the sidewalk.  Even as Ranma looked up he saw a dozen 
burly men surrounding them.  He noticed that they all had a similar tattoo 
and guessed that they were a part of a gang.  As soon as he took this in, he 
started listening to what his friend was yelling at them.

	"What the hell do you bastards think your doing!?  Get the hell out 
of our way!  We're NOT going to be late for our first day of school.  Move 
right NOW!"  Tomas was pissed.  He was actually beyond pissed.  If he were 
Akane he would be mallet happy right now.  The fact that these men (and he 
used the term loosely) would get in his way (and take a cheap pot shot at 
him) on his way to his first day back to school in years ticked him off.  
<Did I actually think that!?>

	"This is snakes' ground little boy, and any who pass through it got 
to pay the toll.  Just hand us all your money and you can go without a scratch."  
The ugly guy in front started to laugh.  Tom noticed that he was missing a 
couple of teeth.  <I wonder how he'd look if he was missing more.>  He also 
noticed that Ranma was next to him instead of on the fence.  His response was 
not what the gang expected, nor did they like the look in his eyes.

	"Alright, a fight.  This is going to be fun.  Hey Ranma, person with 
the least knockouts buys the other lunch."

	"You're on Tomas.  I hope you enjoy paying for it."  With that they 
both got into their respective fighting stances.

*******************************************************************************************

	"Chikuso, we're late for school!"  yelled the boy in the denim jacket.  
The two of them then jumped on the fence and took off at an incredible rate.  
Makoto then realized that she was also going to be late and set off at a run 
to Juuban High.  Her thoughts kept drifting back to the young men and how much 
they looked like her old boyfriend.

********************************************************************************************

	Usagi was late for school.  This in itself was not unusual.  Nine 
times out of ten she was making her mad dash to Juuban High.  Her thoughts 
were locked on avoiding detention when a pair of blurs passes her.  Looking 
closely she saw what appeared to be school bags on their backs.  She was 
about to dismiss them as another pair of late arrivals when a thought hit her.  
Usagi skidded to a halt and gasped.  "They were running on the fence!"

*********************************************************************************************

Minako was not her normal bubbly self.  She was extremely tired.  <Why did Ami 
have to get here 15 minuets early.  I could have used the extra sleep.  Just 
because she likes school shouldn't mean she has to inflict it on me.>

	Minako Aino, a girl with blonde hair to her waist and beautiful blue eyes, 
was almost as bad a Usagi when it came to getting to school.  Her friends took 
turns going to her house to wake her up.  She turned to regard one of her best 
friends.  Ami was slightly shorter and had blue hair cut short.  The two of them 
were sitting under a tree in the front of the building.  Minako about to give Ami 
a piece of her mind about dragging her to school early when two figures appeared 
in front of her.  One of them was wearing a red chines shirt and black pants.  
His hair was in a pig tail and as black as a stallion's main.  The other was a 
number of inches taller.  He had a denim jacket over a black shirt, jeans, and a 
black cap on backwards with his sandy blonde bangs hanging out.

	The one with the cap on started to speak.

	"Excuse me, but you are the most incredible girl that I have ever seen.  
Your beauty is like the rising sun on my cold life.  Please say that you will 
allow me to take you on a date."

	Minako blushed deeply and was about to reply when a pair of snapping 
fingers in front of her face brought her back to reality.

	"'scuse me, but are you alright?  I asked you if this was Juuban High?"

	Minako, blushing even more because of her dream replied with a stuttering 
yes and watched the two figures as they entered the high school.  <Those two have 
to be among the best looking guys I've ever seen.  They even give Mamoru a run for 
his money in the looks department.>  "Hey, Ami, what do you think about those two guys?"

	Looking up Ami frowned.  She looked but didn't see anyone around.  "Which 
guys are those?"  She had never looked up from her book.

**************************************************************************************************

	"Hey, Ranma, did you see the way that blonde was looking at me?  I was afraid 
that her head was going to explode from all the blood rushing to her head."

	"What do you mean Tomas?  Except for looking a bit hot she seemed fine to me.  
She really ought to take care of that sunburn, though."

	Tomas facefaulted.  He couldn't believe what he just heard.  Was his best 
friend that dense when it came to women?  He hoped not.  He quickly picked himself up 
and started towards the main office, right behind Ranma.  By the time he got there 
Ranma was in a deep argument with the secretary.

	"Look, do I seem like a girl to you?  I don't care what those records say.  Here, 
look at my transcripts from Frunkin High.  They'll tell you I'm a guy."  He then handed a 
file folder that he had pulled from his bag.  The secretary looked it over and saw that it 
was the same except for the gender.  She then gave Ranma his schedule and grumbled about 
"those damned computers."  Tomas gave her a once over and stepped forward.

	"Pardon me, but I am also a new student here.  My name is Tomas Megerson.  May I 
please have my schedule."

	"Such a polite young man.  Let me see ah here it is.  Have a good first day 
of school."

	"Thank-you.  Lets go Ranma."  The two of them than headed down the hall.
	
	"Hey, Tomas, what was with all that good boy stuff.  You've never acted like 
that before."

	"I just didn't want her to get mad at me too.  I thought I'd try being polite, 
that's all.  She looked like she was having a bad day as it is already.  Say, I'm in room 
314, you?"

	Ranma opened his schedule for the first time.  "I'm in the same room as you.  
That's great, we won't be split up for the whole day.  Should be just up ahead.  Well, 
Tomas, are you ready to start school?"

	"Not one bit, but lets do it anyway.  Won't be the first time I did something 
I didn't want to."  Ranma opened the door and the two of them stepped into the class room.

****************************************************************************************************

	Rei was not in a good mood.  She had been having this nagging feeling since 
the night before.  She had tried to do a fire reading on it, but the only images 
that would come where of a horse and a phoenix.  It made no sense to the young 
Shinto priestess in training then, and it didn't make any now.  She was contemplating 
sleeping through class for once when the door opened.  Two young men, neither in uniform, 
came through.  The teacher turned around to regard them.

	"Can I help you gentlemen?"  The teacher gave them a disapproving 
look for interrupting the class.

	"Yes, we're new students and have been assigned to this class"  
said the one with the cap.  A number of girls in the class started to mummer 
among themselves.  Rei noted that the one who spoke had a slight, almost 
sarcastic smile on his lips.

	The teacher then asked for them to introduce themselves to the class.  
The one in red spoke first.

	"Hi, I'm Ranma Saotome and I'm a martial artist."

	"I'm Tomas Megerson.  Like Ranma I practice the martial arts.  I'm also 
into a few sports but only for recreation, not for a team."

	"Well, then,"the teacher continued," would you mind telling me why your 
late to class?  Being new is no excuse."

	"Before Ranma could put his foot in his mouth Tomas spoke up.  "We're sorry, 
but there was a problem with the computers in the office.  It took them a while to 
find our scheduals."

	"Very well, but don't be late again.  Tomas, you sit in front of Ms. Hino in 
the third row.  Ranma, you're in the second seat in the first row by the window."

	"Thank-you sensei."  Ranma spoke.  He started to move toward his indicated 
seat when the teacher spoke again.

	"Also, you two need to get uniforms.  I don't know why you didn't wear any 
today, but you better have them tomorrow."

	Rei heard Tomas mumble something about not being caught dead in a school 
uniform, but the teacher didn't notice.  All of a sudden her mystic senses started 
blaring.  From what she could tell these two new students were the cause of the nagging 
sensations going on in her head.  As she stared at Tomas' back she heard a soft sound.  
He was snoring.  Glancing over she noticed Ranma doing the same.  <How can they sleep 
through class like this?!  They're worse than Usagi is!  They don't even try to hide the 
fact they're asleep!>  Fortunately for the two martial artists the teacher didn't care.    
He let them sleep through class and then past the lunch bell.  Eventually the only ones 
in the room were Ranma, Rei, and Tomas.  <Well, since they both seem to be out cold, I guess 
I'll try to see if I can find out anything from their chi.>  Rei was just about to probe 
Tomas when he was no longer in his chair.

*****************************************************************************************************

	Tomas was having a peaceful dream.  He was in a world were his parents were still 
with him and he was eating his mother's wonderful cooking.  All too soon for him, his 
danger sense slammed on and his body went into action.  His eyes snapped open and took 
in his surroundings.  <Alright, I'm in a classroom.  Nothing to the front of me or the 
sides which means the danger's behind me.  Better move 'fore I get hit.>  He turned his 
body sideways so his legs were out from under the table.  He then bent back and did a 
hand spring propelling him two rows away, landing in a defensive stance.  His eyes ripped 
around the room, but he didn't see anything.  <Lets see, Ranma's over there sleeping.  The 
girl I sit in front of is in a state of shock, and the rest of the room is empty.  What's 
going on?>

	"What's going on?  Where is everyone?"  Tomas was confused.  His danger sense 
wasn't going off anymore so it was safe.  Still he stayed in his defensive stance.

	Rei was also confused, but for a different reason.  <How did he get over there?  
Did he teleport or something?  What is he?>  She decided that she should answer his question, 
and maybe get him to open up.  "It's lunch time.  The teacher decided to let you sleep.  I 
was, uh, just about to try to wake you up."  <I hope he buys it!>

	<I know she's lying.  Her waking me up wouldn't have set off my danger sense.  
Still, she's not threatening me right now, so I guess it's all right.  Besides, she's 
kinda cute.>  He dropped his stance and gave the girl a once over.  "Uh, I'm afraid that 
I can't recall your first name, Hino-san.  Would you mind telling me, I'm Tomas."

	"I'm Rei.  It is a pleasure to meet you Tomas-san."

	"Likewise, but don't be so formal.  Hey, you said it was lunchtime.  Would you mind 
joining me?  I'd really like the company and it would be nice to have a new friend.  I don't 
have that many."  <Yea, I got one, Ranma.>

	"What about your friend over there.  Shouldn't you wake him?"

	"Ranma?  Nah, let him sleep.  Besides, I, uh well I kinda lost a bet to him earlier 
and owe him lunch.  I don't have enough on me to pay for two of us.  If I let him sleep, 
then I don't have to worry about it until later."

	"That's no a nice thing to do.  I'm going to wake him up."  As Rei took her first 
step towards Ranma, Tomas grabbed her arm and turned her around.  She was about to scream 
at him to take his hands off of her when she saw a desperate look in his eyes.  It shocked 
her so much that her anger left her before it could surface.

	"Please, don't!  He eats a lot.  I've only got enough for one person right now.  
There is no way I could buy him lunch and still have some money left over to feed me.  
Don't worry, I promise to pay him back after school."

	Rei didn't know why, but she believed him.  He was making his friend sound almost 
like Usagi when it came to eating.  <Still, I can use this to my advantage.>  "I suppose 
that I can be persuaded to let him sleep, but you owe me."

	"Fine, no problem, name it."

	"To start with, your going to eat lunch with me and some friends of mine.  I'm sure 
that they would be happy to meet you.  We can work out the rest later."  <Not only will 
they be happy to meet you, but jealous because your with me.>  Thinking about it, the looks 
on Minako's and Makoto's faces should be worth it.

	"Hey that sounds great.  Come on, lets go.  I'm starved."  With that his hand 
switched from holding her arm to gently taking her elbow so he could escort her to lunch.  
All through this Ranma slept in peaceful slumber.


	  Rei was in total bliss.  Here she was heading to have lunch with her friends 
(and fellow Senshi) while on the arm of one of the best looking guys in school.  She had 
found out that he was 19 years old, but had been out of school since his parents died a 
couple of years ago.  They had just gotten their food and had stepped out the door looking 
for Rei's friends when all hell broke loose.

**************************************************************************************************

"Here Usagi, you can have the rest of my lunch, I'm not very hungry."

	"Alright!  Thanks Mako-chan.  Mmph ulrg grunb this is urmph good!"  Usagi's day 
just went from bad to good.  She had been late to school and was sent to the principal's 
office.  Then she had gotten a lecture on being to class on time and something she had 
never thought of before;  she had to come to school an hour early for morning detention 
for the next three days.  But now, Makoto (the best cook Usagi knows) was giving her the 
huge, delouse lunch that was now before her.  Without a thought she dug in.  It was all 
going great until a shadow fell over the girls.  They looked up and gasped in shock.  There 
was the biggest (and ugliest) youma that they had ever seen.  And one of its clawed hands 
was streaking toward Minako's throat!
