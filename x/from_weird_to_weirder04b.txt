This is the standard disclaimer that all fanfics get. The characters 
of Ranma ½ belong to Rumiko Takakashi. The characters of Sailor Moon 
belong to Naoko Takeuchi. Tenchi Muyo! Belongs to Kajishima Masaki.  
This is all for non-profit reasons, so please don't sue me. I don't 
have enough to make it worth while anyway. And now on with the story. 

Note: I know Ranma is acting out of character. The reasons why will 
be explained in memories and flashbacks throughout the story. Also, 
in this story I'm throwing all of the Inner Senshi into Juuban high.   
They are all the same age as Ranma, about 17.  Tomas is 19, but has 
been out of school since his parents' death, about two years, so he 
is in the same grade as Ranma.  I'm also making Hotaru 15 in this, 
but she goes to a different school.  This is an alternate Sailor Moon 
universe, but the changes are pretty much in age.  In the Ranma 
Time-line it is about 14 months after the bombed wedding.  For the 
Sailor Moon universe this is somewhere between Sailor Moon S and Sailor 
Moon SS.  For the Tenchi Universe this happens after the second movie.  
Washu has aged Mayuka to 14 years.  This is NOT an SI fic.

Chapter 4
Part B
Questions but no Answers

	Hotaru lay in her bed, looking for all the world as if she 
was in a wonderful dreamscape where she only needed to believe to 
make her heart's deepest wish come true.  She rested upon her back, 
her dark hair flayed on her pillow, and her chest rising and falling 
in the slow steady pattern of sleep.  Her sheets were pulled up to 
her neck, while the bedspread was folded and resting upon the chair 
which accompanied her desk.  The shining light of the full moon 
glowed on a paper which was fluttering as a gentle breeze blew through 
the room.

	Haruka smiled at the scene before her and, knowing that her 
daughter was safe, closed the door.

	Hotaru's eyes snapped open.  A small sigh escaped her lips 
and she went back to all of the questions that had been raised to her 
eyes.  Who were the two that hurt Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama?  And 
what did happen?  What her guardians told her and what she saw with 
her own eyes were conflicting.  She was told that the bad people had 
attacked first, but she was sure that she had scene the World Shaking 
and Deep Submerge attacks go off before the flames.  Was there a melee 
fight before?  If so, why were there no bruises on her guardians?  
Surely if the bad people could hurt them, they would have left marks.   
If the bad people had won, why didn't they stay?  For that matter, how 
could two injured people defeat three of the Sailor Senshi?  Another 
sigh escaped her lips.  As her heavy eyes closed on their own accord, 
and sleep sought to claim her, one final question crossed her mind.  
<Does anyone else have as many questions as I do?>

*********************************************************************************

	"AAAHHHHH! PERVERT!"

	Ranma had been sitting in the furo, relaxing his muscles from 
the day of fighting.  His mind was drifting over the many events.  <With 
all that happened I forgot about mom.  I'll give her a call as soon as I'm 
done in here.  Right now, I have other problems.  What am I going to do 
about my curse?  I've got to tell them, but what will they think?  I meet 
a cousin I never new I had, and I've got to show him something that will 
push him away from me.  (sigh) life is never easy.>  He rose from the depths 
and headed to get his towel.  He made it half way before Aeka walked in, 
her own towel wrapped arround her.  The familer scream (at least to Ranma) 
filled the air followed closely by a bunch of logs.  Ranma barely had time 
to contemplate the floating wood before he entered blissful unconsiousness.

***********************************************************************************

	Sasami carried a plate of food through the door to Washu's subspace 
lab.  It had been almost seven hours since the fight in the woods, and the 
boy who had protected her sister was still unheard from.  Even though it was 
now passed the midnight hour, no one in the Masaki household was asleep.  
Well, no one except the black-haired youth that Aeka electrocuted for sneaking 
into the bath.  Ranma was still missing and until the black-hair boy woke up 
they wouldn't know where the girl was or what happened to her.

	Sasami sighed at the thought.  Here she was, hoping to make some new 
friends and meet some new family, and one was missing and the other unconscious.  
She looked over at Tomas's inert body as she passed, noting that he was looking 
better.  Sasami continued to head toward Washu, who was monitoring some displays.  
"Washu-san, I brought you a snack.  If you're going to be up all night you 
should eat something."

	"Thanks Sasami.  Say, this looks good!"  The red-hair genius started 
to shovel the food into her mouth.  As the food disappeared Washu turned her 
attention to the display clock in her lab.  "What are you doing up at this 
hour, Sasami?  Its after one.  You should be in bed."

	"I couldn't sleep.  With Tenchi-san's cousin missing and her friend 
severely injured, I was worried.   No one else is asleep either.  Even Mayuka 
is still awake.  Ryouko and Kiyone are watching over that boy so they can find 
out where Ranma-neesan is.  Everyone else is in the living room trying to figure 
out what happened."

	"Well, Sasami, I can put you at ease in one category for all this."  She 
waved a hand at Tomas's body.  "He is fine.  In fact, I'm surprised that he isn't 
up yet.  He should have been moving around over an hour ago."

	"And I would have been if someone hadn't taken my clothes.  I don't care 
for giving free peep shows to children."

	The two aliens turned to look at Tomas who was now sitting up with his 
head in his hands.  He was groaning and mumbling something about a headache.

	Sasami got her first good look at him.  Well muscled, thin, with sandy 
blonde hair and striking blue eyes.  She hoped that he would be her friend.  
With her sister and Ryouko always arguing over Tenchi-sama, she needed someone 
to talk to.

	Washu's thoughts were totally different.  Her sensors were going 
balistic trying to read his power level.  He was almost as strong as Lord 
Tenchi!  Here was a prime test subject!  Her mind was already going over all 
of  the samples she'd get to take.

	Ryo-ohki, who was on top of Sasami's head as always, had one thought 
on her mind.  <New friend!>  She then proceded to introduce her self.  "Miya!"

	That got Tomas's attention.  He was familiar with the neko-ken from the 
journey, and didn't want to experience it again.  <I've got to find that cat 
and get rid of it!  If Ranma comes across it we'll be in trouble.  I can't even 
break him from the neko-ken.>  His eyes darted around the room trying to find 
the feline.  All that his eyes came across was a weird looking rabbit on the 
blue-hair girl's head.  "You better get rid of the cat.  If Ranma comes across 
it we're going to be in trouble.  I don't want him to flip on me."

	Sasami stared at Ranma perplexed.  "Why do you keep calling Ranma him?  
Ranma's a girl."

	"And you don't have to worry about her having a problem with cats 
because she's missing."

	That brought Tomas out of the cat problem fast.  He stared at Washu 
for a few minuets before he finally got his head working.  "Who are you two?  
And for that matter where am I?  And where's Ranma?  If anything happened to him…."

	Washu looked at him with a familiar gleem in her eyes.  It is like she 
is looking at a new test subject (which she hopes she is).  "I am Washu, the 
greatest scientific genus in the Universe!  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

	Tomas took his time looking at her, and around the room.  After a few 
moments of silence he waved his hand taking in everything around him.  "You 
build all this?"

	"Why yes, I did.  This is my lab.  Had you gone anywhere else you 
probably would have died."

	"Well, I'll have to agree with you, Washu.  I've never seen any place 
like this in my life."

	"Call me Washu-chan."  

	"Err… yeah…sure."  Tomas sweated as he looked at her.  He could tell 
that there would be problems with her.  <Well, there's no way I can deal with 
her now.  I better find out what I can of the other one.>  He took a good look 
at the other girl.  Her long blue hair was done up in two pony tails that flowed 
down her back.  Her eyes caught his attention.  He had never seen a shade 
quite that color before.  <Man, if she was only older.  Oh, well, might as 
well make a friend.>  "And you are?" 

	"I'm Sasami.  And this is Ryo-ohki."

	"Miya!"

	Hearing this, one of Tomas's eyebrows went up.  "What kind of cat is 
that?  It looks more like a rabbit."

	"Ryo-ohki's a cabbit, and she's my best friend!"

	<Hmmm… never heard of a cabbit before.  Wonder where they come from.  
And those eyes of hers, why do they seem so lonely?>  Tomas recalled what she 
had said and the thought struck him.  <Of course, she said that fluff ball on 
her head is her best friend.>  "I take it there aren't that many kids your age 
up here, huh."

	"No.  Only the Masaki family lives up here."  Tomas could see that she 
was starting to get depresses and tried to find a way to stop it.

	"Well, Sasami, uh, how would you like to be my friend?"

	"You mean it?"

	"Yeah.  I don't have many friends either, so I'm always looking for 
new ones.  In fact, Ranma is the only true friend I've got right now.  Although 
Rei seems like she could become one."

	Washu was smiling at the touching scene.  Not because of how emotional 
it was, but if he became Sasami's friend, then he would be around more.  If he 
was around more, she could do more tests!  At the mention of Ranma, however, a 
frown crossed her face.  She quickly decided that it would be in the best 
interest to let Tomas know what had happened.  "Speaking of which, you did get 
the part about Ranma missing, right?"

	Tomas blinked twice and then exploaded.  "What the hell do you mean 
he's missing!?  Where is he!?"

	"We don't know.  She went to take a bath and when Aeka went to join 
her, she was gone.  There was a black hair boy instead.  Aeka knocked him out."  
The releaf that crossed Tomas's face took Washu by surprise.  She mentally 
chalked it up to the fact that they caught the pervert.  "Ryouko and Kiyone 
are waiting for him to wake up so they can question him."  For some strange 
reason a breeze blew her hair.  "Do you know anyone who could have kidnapped 
her?"  She looked up from the display she was going over to see that only her, 
Sasami, and Ryo-ohki were in the lab.  The door was wide open leading into the 
Masaki home.

******************************************************************************************

	Ranma's eyes slowly opened.  He was on his back and his body was racked with 
pain.  He groined as he pushed himself into a sitting position.  "Kami-sama, I feel 
like I was struck by lightning."

	"That's because you were.  And if you don't due as we say, then it will 
happen again."  Ranma turned his head toward the cold voice.  There he saw two young 
women, around his age, giving him the worst evil eye he had ever seen.  His mind 
caught up to his eyes and relief flooded through him.  He knew he wasn't in trouble 
now.

	"Ryouko, am I glad to see you!  What happened to the psycho with the logs?  
She's not going to fry me again, is she?"  Ranma kept up his babbling for another 
few minuets before Ryouko cut him off.  

	"How the hell do you know me?  I've never seen you before in my life 
until Aeka dragged you in here.  Although your perceptions on her are pretty 
accurate."

	"What do you mean that you've never seen me before?  Its me, Ranma.  
The guy you talked to at the lake and faught beside you in the woods.  Don't 
tell me you for got."

	Kiyone took this moment to speak up.  "I don't think so.  Ranma's got 
red hair and is a girl..."

	"HEY, I AM A GUY!!!"

	Kiyone just ignored him and kept going.  "Since you are most defenately 
male, that or you're the flattest girl I have ever seen..."

	"I TOLD YOU I AM A GUY!"

	"Which is why you are not Ranma."

	"I am Ranma, and I am a GUY!  It's a curse, okay.  You hit me 
with cold water and I turn into a red hair girl.  Get me a glass of water 
and I'll prove it to you."

	Before Ryouko could reply to how stupid a lie that was, the door 
burst open and Tomas, still in the sheet from Washu's lab, rushed in.  He 
looked around the room, saw Ranma all right, and collapsed.  "Thank the Kami 
your alright.  I was afraid that they would skin you before you could explain 
the curse.  You are okay, right Ranma?"

	"Yeah, I'm fine, but how about you?  You don't look to good."

	"Just really low in my ki levels.  Give me a good day's rest, and a 
good meal or two, and I'll be fine."

	Ryouko looked from one to the other a few times before the sight 
finally got to her.  "You mean that he" she pointed to Ranma "really is 
Ranma, and that the business about a curse was real!?"

	"Well, yeah, didn't he tell you already?"  He turned and gave 
Ranma a despairing look.  "I know you hate telling people about your 
curse, but do youwant to be in the same mess as last time?  From what 
you told me the exact same thing happened."

	"Sorry, but this time I did remember to put up the occupied 
sign.  That should count for something.  It does, doesn't it?"  
Tomas simply grasped his head in his hands and groined.  
*************************************************************************************

Next:  The true meeting between the Masaki Household and Ranma and 
Tomas.  What will be the reactions to the different chaos in each 
others lives?  Will Ryo-ohki activate the Neko-ken?  And we'll see how 
the inner Senshi feel about all that has happened in the past 
forty-eight hours.
