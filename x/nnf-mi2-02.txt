* NO NEED FOR A MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2!  (PART TWO)*
***************************************************

SEVILLE, SPAIN


	The inside of the mansion was rather humid.  The sweat kicked off by the 
energized flamenco dancers was exasperatingly high.
	Tenchi stood with his back against a post and watched the party play off 
with full force.  The wine and spirits flowed abundantly that night and many 
were clapping their hands with the dancers, feeling the rhythm of the music.  On 
the second story, there were others enjoying themselves and were amassed around 
the indoor balcony to get a better view of the dancing.
	Tenchi wiped the sweat forming on his brow; it was getting hot.  A waiter 
dressed in white came up to him with an almost empty wine tray balanced on his 
hand.
	The waiter simled.  "Senor Masaki, a drink for you?"
	Tenchi lightly shook his head.  "No, gracias."
	The watier gave a slight bow and walked off.  Tenchi scanned the faces of 
the crowd, searching for the darling face of Ryoko.  He quickly glanced at her 
resume in Utah before leaving; it was impressive.  In her young life, Ryoko was 
charged a high level theft crime in almost every Western European country as 
well as the Americas.  She was a slippery catch as well, seventy eight 
allegations and only five of them stuck.
	Tenchi sighed and started mingling with the crowd.  His hands dipped into 
his pants pockets.  His right hand fingered the small bag of angel dust in his 
pocket; his energy booster.
	Time stopped.
	In his life, Tenchi Masaki had only seen a few women in his life that he 
had considered to be beautiful.  Ryoko was now at the top of that short list; 
Ashley Judd was now a distant second...  
	She moved as if she were caught in slow motion.  The dress she wore was 
black and skin tight held on to her by spaghetti straps.  Her hair was a strange 
color, that of green or blue...or, "Cyan," he thought.  Her hair was wild 
looking yet nothing seemed strange about it, she blended into the crowd 
seemingly good enough.  He noticed a few men looking her way, their eyes 
silently consuming her body from the neck down.  Tenchi smirked at that thought, 
somehow it was funny to him.
	Tenchi bit his lip.  It was the way her golden eyes reflected the candle 
light.  It was the way she moved.  It was the way her ample chest bounced 
slightly in tune with her walking rhythm.  It was the way her legs curved 
splendidly into the rest of her equally curved body.  It was her feminine yet 
almost feline face that hammered itself into his mind the most.  She casually 
glanced at him, and once the casual glance began to turn into a full length 
stare of interest, Tenchi felt his heart speeding up and the rest of his body 
gradually fading away, leaving only his eyes to savor her image.
	Although it was probably his imagination, Tenchi swore the chandeliers and 
candles dimmed their light just as she walked into the room.  He quickly broke 
off the stare and turned his attention to the bar behind him.  The clammoring, 
writhing sounds of the dancer's shoes hitting the wooden floor suddenly came 
back into focus which struck him as odd -- as if he had forgotten that there was 
a party going on around him.  Out of the corner of his eye, he watched as Ryoko 
made her way upstairs.  Barely keeping his smile in check, Tenchi followed 
behind.

************************

	Ryoko made her way past the dance floor and the strange looking man that 
was staring at her.
	"Ah, he's cute," she thought, but quickly shrugged it off as she neared 
the location of the owner's diamond necklance.  Upstairs was where the owner's 
bodyguards were, but she was quick, as she had always been.  Within minutes, she 
was inside the master bathroom.
	It was large, the tiled floor looked like marble.  It was almost Roman in 
nature, complete with marble pillars.  The bath tub lay before her.  She reached 
into her tiny purse and pulled out a set of lock picks.  Near the bath tub's 
nozzle was a green tile with a keyhole in it.  A few twists and turns from her 
pick and the little tile popped open.  Under the tile was a small handle which 
was attached to a metal box.  It was inserted side down and slid out easily with 
a simple tug.  Her mouth watered as she went to open --
	"Hey."
	The man's voice startled her and she almost fell off the tub.  Her hands 
balled up into fists, ready to fight for her prize.  She realized that the man's 
face was that of the man that was staring at her from the party.  She relaxed a 
little.
	"Hey yourself."
	The man scratched his head.  "I was thinking to myself, 'Maybe I should 
ask that gorgeous woman if she'd like a drink.'  So, I followed her, and now 
I've found her."
	Ryoko played it cute, but still kept her edge in check.  "And now what 
will you do with her now that you've found her?"
	"God, she's beautiful," he thought, "Why are the cute ones always 
outlaws?"
	Ryoko arched her neck to the side, playfully tossing her hair.  "Surely 
you wouldn't stammer at the key moment?"
	"Huh?  Oh, yes..."  Before he could say anything more, Ryoko suddenly 
grabbed him and and threw him on top of her.  At that moment, two bodyguards 
strode by, checking the place out.  Nothing seemed amiss and they went about 
their way.  Tenchi lay on top of her.  "Smells nice too," he thought.
	Ryoko looked at him a moment before coyfully smiling.  "Mind if I'm on 
top?"
	"Be my guest."
	Tenchi rolled onto his back while Ryoko sat on top of his chest.  She 
picked up the small box and pulled it out of it's sleeve.  She opened the box 
and pulled out a shimmering diamond necklace.
	Tenchi smiled.  "Senor Cid's diamond necklace.  I heard it's going on 
auction tomorrow.  There's a rumor the starting bid's going to be 98,000 
American dollars."
	Ryoko shrugged as she dropped the necklance in between in her breasts and 
down into her dress. "You mean the starting bid was going to be 98,000."
	She closed the box and slid it back into it's holding place.  She was 
getting ready to close the tile down on top of it until Tenchi stopped her.
	"I wouldn't that if I were you."
	She didn't listen and closed the tile shut.
	All around the mansion an alarm went off.  Ryoko gasped and began looking 
all around in a  panic.
	Five men dressed in black rushed into the bathroom.  Ryoko stepped out of 
the bath tub and stood still, her eyes wild with panic.  Tenchi got out of the 
tub and waved his hands in front of him, a calm smile running across his face.  
"Tranquilo, tranquilo..."
	A man in a white tuxedo suddenly appeared, waving off the men in black and 
yelling at them in Spanish.  The men then walked off and the white suit wearing 
man smiled at Tenchi and bowed profusely.  He turned around again and yelled at 
his men in English.  "How dare you show such disrespect to our chief security 
man!"  The alarm mysteriously stopped.
	Tenchi smiled.  "It's okay, Senor Castalia, I was just testing the alarm.  
It is the night before the auction."
	"Yes, yes," Castalia said, "I hope I didn't cause too much of an 
embarassment."
	"No, no.  Miss Ryoko and I were giving the system a last minute check; she 
specializes in security as well.  We both feel the desired weight was a little 
light."  He then turned to a stunned Ryoko who was trying her best to play it 
cool.  "What did you recommend?  Ten kilos?"
	Ryoko blinked. "Huh?  Oh yes, ten kilos is sufficient."
	Castalia nodded his head in approval.  "Yes, Mr. Masaki, I was thinking of 
a change."
	"Good, good.  Well, I'll leave you to it then.  Come Ms. Ryoko."
	Ryoko rapidly walked past Tenchi, eager to get away, but his hand caught 
her arm and pulled her back.  She looked at him with fear; would he turn her in?
	Tenchi cleared his throat.  "Ahem.  Um, Ms. Ryoko?"
	Ryoko's face sank as she reached inside her dress and pulled out the 
necklace.  Castalia recoiled in shock.  "What were you trying to do?  Rob me?"
	Ryoko looked at Tenchi and flashed a twisted smile.  "The thought had 
crossed my mind."

**********************

	Outside the mansion, Tenchi and Ryoko stood in the courtyard, away from 
anyone else.  Tenchi reached into his pocket and pulled out a plastic baggie 
filled with white powder.  Before she could ask what it was, he stuck his nose 
inside the bag and inhaled deeply.  His jaw dropped down and his eyes went wide.  
The tip of his nose looked powdery and an enormous smile was on his face.
	Ryoko stood glaring at him.  "The f&#k is this, coffee break time?"
	"Huh?  Ugghhh...vibes, dude...f*&$%#g trippy @$$ vibes..."
	Ryoko snorted and crossed her arms.  "What the hell did you think you were 
doing in there?  Do you know how long I've planned that heist?"
	"What?  Hey, uh, you can't talk like that to me, I saved your life.
	"What were they gonna do, shoot me or something?"
	"Probably, wait hold on a -- "  Tenchi suddenly vomited all over the 
ground.  "AHH.  GOOD IS GOOD."
	Ryoko threw her hands up in disgust and began walking away.
	"YOU CANNOT WALK AWAY FROM FUTABA!"
	Ryoko turned around, flipped him the bird, and continued walking.
	Tenchi's eyes narrowed as his imaginary cross hairs pinpointed on Ryoko.  
"No escape..."
	Before she knew it, Tenchi tackled her and pinned her to the ground.
	"Ouch!  G*d$mn it!  What are doing?"
	Tenchi smiled.  "Huh?  Oh yeah, hey, check this out."  He reached into his 
pocket and pulled out something that looked like a garage door opener.  He 
pressed a gray button on it and the mansion alarm went off again.  Ryoko went 
wide eyed with rage.  "WHAT?!?"
	Tenchi shut off the alarm and smiled.  "Hey, check it out.  I'm also a 
spy."
	"What?"
	"Yeah, for reals.  I work for the United States government, so you know 
I'm legit."  Before Ryoko could shake her head, Tenchi loud a huge and 
enveloping vomit burp.  Ryoko went green and pinched her lips tightly together 
to keep from losing her own lunch.  Her eyes watered over in tears.
	"OH...MY...GOD!" She cried out.
	"Damn, girl, we haven't even got to f*ckin' yet and you're saying all the 
right things to me!  Come here..."  His lowered his sweaty, puckering lips down 
to hers.  Ryoko couldn't hold it anymore and let loose with a hot, steaming jet 
of partially digested lunch into Tenchi's face.  Tenchi bounced off her like a 
scared cat and Ryoko rolled away.
	Tenchi dunked his head into a nearby fountain and yelled garbled messages.
	Ryoko felt steam coming out of her ears.  "Look, jack off, I'm not playing 
around with you!  Get this straight, I don't do windows, I don't do laundry, and 
I damn sure don't go around with gross ass scrubs like you!  Why don't you go be 
a secret agent and spy a look at my foot kicking yo' ass!"
	Ryoko spun around on her heel and left.  Tenchi, totally sober, took his 
head out of the fountain.  "Oh, no.  I lost her.  Stupid addiction.  Oh well, I 
guess I'll go follow her and have a visually stunning 15 minute car chase or 
something."
	Tenchi grabbed the keys to his crummy baige Civic V-TEC and followed after 
her sleek (you select what year and make to your own dream car, it's 11:30 p.m. 
and I'm too tired for car description).  He wiped his mouth to rid away the 
chunks of a late lunch off his mouth.

***********************

15 VISUALLY STUNNING MINUTES LATER


	"BUT I AM!!!  I REALLY AM A SPY!"
	Ryoko clung to the bumper of her sleek (dream car insertion) which was an 
inch away from dropping over the edge of an immense cliff.  Tenchi sat there on 
the trunk of her car, sitting cross legged and staring at her.  She grit her 
teeth so hard her head was beginning to hurt.
	"ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I BELIEVE YOU!  JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE!"
	Tenchi reached out his hand and plucked Ryoko out of the air and hauled 
her to the ground.  Tenchi got off the car and gave her a hug.  Seconds later, 
Ryoko's (dream car insertion) finally plummeted to it's end, exploding upon 
impact.
	Ryoko returned Tenchi's embrace and kissed his cheek.  "That's the last 
time I doubt you, especially if it leads to this."
	Tenchi smiled.  "I'm sorry Ms. Ryoko, I have a nasty habit as you saw; it 
appears during high pressure situations.  You'd think I'd be prepared for this 
sort of thing, but..."
	He trailed off and lowered his head.  Bad agent, he thought, bad agent...
	Ryoko raised Tenchi's head with two of her fingers on his chin.  "I heard 
you mentioned that you knew people at INTERPOL."
	"Yes, I wasn't lying.  Your criminal record will definitely be gone if you 
do this job for me."
	"What is it?"
	Tenchi smiled and held her soft face in his hands.  Ryoko felt his thumb 
run over her cheek and then felt her eyes narrow coyly when she realized what it 
was.
	"It's not that," he said, "But it wouldn't hurt."

*************************

TENCHI'S PLACE

	They had spent the night at Tenchi's suite in an expensive hotel.  
	After much explaining, and even more groping, the mission was clear to 
Ryoko.  Something called "Pokemon" needed to be stolen.  But if anything was 
stolen, it was her heart.  Tenchi was a much better thief than she was 
apparently.
	The morning sun had dawned and Tenchi liked the way the sunlight hit her 
naked shoulders.  He silently moved out of his bed to keep from waking Ryoko up.  
She squirmed a little and her eyes began to open.  Tenchi, realizing his mission 
was a failure, got back into bed and nuzzled close to her.  He kissed her on the 
lips and gazed into her eyes.
	"Damn, you're beatiful."
	She smiled at him.  "Where were you going?"
	"There's this nice cafe downstairs.  I was going to bring you a breakfast 
burrito or something."
	"We can go together."
	Tenchi winked an eye.  "We should shower first.  Get clean."
	Ryoko laughed and smiled.  "Okay."
	After showering together, they made their way down to the cafe.  They 
talked over breakfast about the upcoming mission.
	"I'm hoping it'll be quick and to the point," Tenchi said, "I'm meeting my 
superior tonight, so I need you to stay put, okay?"
	"That's fine."
	After breakfast, they went back to his room and made love a fourth time.  
Afterwards, amidst the afterglow, Tenchi looked down at his sleeping beauty.  If 
I could just have her, he thought, I could go without nothing else.
	But then he thought of his gnarly angel dust still sitting in his jacket 
pocket and wondered.

END OF PART TWO.
