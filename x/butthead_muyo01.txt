---------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a "normal" summer day, at least as normal as it gets
in the Misaki household.  Tenchi awoke with the dawn and
prepared for a day of work.  He showered, dressed, and headed
downstairs for breakfast.  Everyone was there except Washu,
which was normal, and they greeted him.  They ate, Ryoko and
Ayeka fought, Sasami started on the dishes, Mihoshi went back
to sleep, and Tenchi left for the fields.

The day passed as normal for Tenchi.  He worked in the fields,
ate lunch, started on chores around the shrine, and had
training with his grandfather.  After all was done, he headed
home.

As Tenchi approached the house, he noted a new satellite dish
had been put on the roof.  He made a mental note to ask about
it at dinner.

Tenchi stepped inside the front door just as Sasami started
calling everyone to the table.  As they ate and chatted, Tenchi
asked about the dish on the roof.

"Oh, that's just a little something I came up with in my spare
time.  I just threw some spare parts together to make it,"
answered Washu.

"Yeah, but what does it do?" asked Tenchi.

"What's it look like?  It's a satellite dish for the television,
only it picks up every channel on the planet, and a few from
around the galaxy."

"Wow, does it work?"

"I don't know, we'll test it out after dinner."

They enjoyed the rest of the meal and finished.  Tenchi went to
the kitchen to help Sasami wash dishes.  Washu retreated to the
lab to check the connections to the dish system.  The others sat
on the couch to play a video game until the others could join
them.  After a half hour the dishes were done and the connections
were fine.

Washu stood up in front of the television.

"I've got something to show all of you.  This is the new remote
control."  Washu held up an otherwise normal looking remote.

"Please be careful with it, there's only one for now.  To make
finding your shows easier, I've set up buttons by category.
There are different buttons for sports, soaps, animation, movies,
documentaries, news, etc.  Anyways, they're all labelled on the
remote.  Just push the button for what kind of show you want to
watch, select what region and area you want, then flip around
till you find what you're looking for.  I'll be taking suggestions
as you get used to it so that I can make improvements.  Well, let's
see if it works."

Washu walked to the couch and sat down.  She pointed the remote
at the television, everyone held their breath, and she pushed
the power button.  The television awoke and bathed them with its
warm light.

"First let's see what's on the Tokyo news."

She pushed the news button, selected Japan and Tokyo, then went
up a few channels.  A familiar news team appeared.

"In other news, our chopper has spotted Godzilla making his way
to shore for his annual wave of rampant destruction.  But don't
worry, folks, the national defense has a sure-fire plan this time.
An earlier report indicates that Mothra is headed our way as
well..."

Washu sighed.

"You humans and your damned nuclear energy.  Every other
civilized race in the galaxy figured out how dangerous that stuff
is.  But, I guess it's all part of your fascination with killing
each other," she exclaimed.

The next couple of hours passed uneventfully as they went through
the various channels available.  Washu had installed a universal
subtitler so they could watch anything from anywhere.  After a
while, they discovered that there was nothing good on anywhere.
So, everyone went to their rooms.

Not long after...

It was a fine night for drinking.  The stars were out, the air was
warm, and a pleasant breeze blew through the trees.  Unfortunately,
the Masaki household was out of sake.  So, Ryoko went pawing through
the kitchen cabinets to find something from which she could get a
buzz.

"Cough syrup (what's that doing here?), well, as a last resort;
Mad Dog 20/20, (who the hell bought that crap?) geez, even *I* have
my limits; ahh, here we go, some vodka, and bourbon.  I've been
meaning to try those.  Wait, what was on that show, a 'flaming moe?'
That could be interesting," she thought to herself with a cat-like
grin.

Ryoko gathered the bottles together and headed towards the roof to
have a few drinks and enjoy the stars before going to bed.

"Sigh, if only I could get Tenchi to have a drink or two with me.
It would probably do him good.  He's so darn uptight all the time."


Later...

Later at night, Tenchi found he couldn't sleep.  He crept
downstairs and turned on the television.  He flipped through
various channels, and wound up watching a peculiar American
cartoon.

"What the...this has to be the worst looking animation I've
ever seen.  And what the hell is a 'bunghole?'  Americans..."
Tenchi thought to himself.  "No wonder American kids are so far
behind us in school, this crap must destroy brain cells or
something."

He watched as two badly drawn teenagers engaged in something
called "couch fishing."  The whole thing was incredibly stupid,
but he could not tear himself away.  Even worse, he found
himself starting to laugh at it.

Washu, meanwhile, sat in her lab staring at some cells dividing.
She was unaware of a small, but growing, hum in the satellite
equipment.

*BOOM!*

One of the power cells suddenly exploded, causing a power surge
throughout the lab and the house.  Most of the energy went into
the new television system...

Tenchi stared transfixed at the television with his mouth hanging
open and a thin line of drool trickling out of it.  He could feel
his brain cells dying one by one while he laughed.  He heard a
muffled explosion in Washu's lab.  The television began throwing
off sparks and wierd beams of light.  The whole thing exploded in
a burst of white light after zapping Tenchi several times.

Meanwhile on the roof...

Ryoko, slowly slumping into a stupor (and beginning to feel rather
ill), heard a dull thudding boom from downstairs.  But the brief
and faint cry she heard cut through the alcoholic fog like a knife.

She phased through the roof and headed to the living room as fast
as she could.  The effects of the alcohol were still upon her and
so she landed clumsily on her head in the living room.  The world
spun around her, but she could clearly make out Tenchi lying
motionless amid the ruin of the burnt couches, broken glass, and
plastic shards lying about.

She hissed through her teeth while struggling to hold back tears.

"Tenchi..."

Ryoko gathered her wits about her and steeled herself to walk over
to him.  She was a bit wobbly, due to being drunk as well as the
blow to the head.  When Ryoko reached him, she knelt over his body
and was much relieved to hear him breathing.

She picked him up and carried him to Washu's lab just as the rest of
the house came downstairs to see what had happened.  They first
saw the living room in blackened chaos, then Ryoko going through
Washu's door with Tenchi in her arms.  She turned her head towards
those on the stairs and they could tell everything they needed to
know in the hard steel of her eyes.  She stepped into the lab, and
the others followed silently after her.

"Hey, I thought this was supposed to be a xover!"

Pretty depressing stuff, huh?  And just how in the world does a
character like Butthead get involved in this?

Not to worry, things are going get, shall we say, *interesting*, in
the next part.  I just had to get things set up first.
