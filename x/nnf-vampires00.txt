Howdy everyone.  I'm Demonicuss.  I'm the guy responsible for writing the 
following work, { Tenchi Muyo!  No Need for ... Vampires?!?! }

Right now you're probably wondering: Who the heck is this "Deacon Briars" dude?  
Let me explain the background.

I'm a part of a writing staff of a Round-Robin series called "The Infinites" For
 proof, head over to our webpage, located at 
{www.geocities.com/backspaced.geo/index.html}  The Infinites stories follow the 
adventures of a group of beings picked from around the Multiverse in order to 
protect all of Reality.  One of these Infinites happens to be Deacon Briars, a 
rather grumpy vampire / pro killer.

In our latest story, "Lost in Infinity", our heroes were planning to teleport 
down to Khazan, a city located on a Multiversal nexus, in order to receive awards 
for their daring do.  However, due to some freak accident, the Infinites get 
scattered across the Multiverse.  Deacon just happened to get dumped in the 
Tenchiverse. 

I hope you enjoy TM:NNFV, and hope that this peaks your interest in reading the 
other Infinites stories we have.

Catch you in the Ether
