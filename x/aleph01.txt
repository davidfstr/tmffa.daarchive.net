***** 	"So, one has to consider that each (index) level increases complexity 
by an exponential amount. A simple comparison for our guests is a parabolic 
equation like X squared. The change is minor in the lowest numbers, but 
becomes increasingly greater with each step. Regarding Aleph-(index), suffice 
it to say anything beyond Aleph-Two is intrinsically incomprehensible in its 
subtleties to any known mind still able to communicate normally with the 
average galactic citizen..."

This time - 	What has happened before:

		 A Universe Was Dying.

	 Taxing their incredible genius, inspiration and intuition (and lots
of luck) beyond limit, two 'superpowered' scientists discovered an energy
deficiency in the so-called reality constant, but also determined a way of
replenishing it by tapping the very core of reality itself across dimensional
barriers using the virtually unlimited energies of the human mind, which, as
they theorized, are able to generate and manipulate energies beyond 
sub-quantum levels under certain circumstances. 
	 They built and activated a device to link one of them with his 
other-reality self-equivalent and to use this link as a channel to transfer the 
necessary, locally superfluous sub-quantum factors to them, while possibly, 
as a kind of payment, endowing the alternate self with unpredictable powers. 
	 But the experiment didn't work exactly as advertised... 

 The Signal is on its way... Now!


<A: Couldn't be more dramatic...>

<O: Shhh! We're watching my - no, effectively _our_ past now. The path of
events we can not - will not - interfere in. _I_ don't want to cease to exist.
Do you?>

<A: NO! But... weren't we watching the... other side... just before?>

<O: Must be another continuity flash. Time may be an illusion, but this is/was
happening simultaneously to the other events... We are drawn into the flow of
events again. I think, we are slowly shifting into temporal phase... My mind
seems to become less muddled. Maybe this way we tune in to a suitable
insertion-window.>

<A: Maybe... But the last turn of events was scary. And that comes from a girl
who remembers Kagato and Kain. Not to mention other things...>

<O: Something is happening... the viewpoints are merging...>


	 As yet (and for quite a while more) unknowing of the far-reaching 
events, a more-or-less normal human being sat in front of a more-or-less as 
normal computer, in a more-or-less normal country somewhere on the northern 
hemisphere of a more-or-less not very important third planet of a small, 
more-or-less average yellow sun somewhere in an probably as unimportant 
spiral arm of an almost as unimportant galaxy in a not quite uncommon reality...


<A: And if you believe in this unimportance b***sh**, I've got some 
prime swampland on Titan for sale for you...>

<O: Well, it felt somewhat like that at times... But still... Thanks.>

*The Signal Is On Its Way -  1 : 10 to the power of 23 and falling...*

<A: Why does this sound so familiar...?>

<O: Let me remember ... 42? Yes... it's... Aleph-Four... squared...>

<A: What is happening? Ori? You're - fading!>

<O: Past, Present and Future... 
The Three who are One... 
Male, female, child...
all the variations, all the possibilities... 
The Warriors Three...
Crone, Mother, Maiden... 
Mage, Warrior, Trickster...>

<A: Ori! get a grip... you're rambling... (He really is fading... I knew it
was dangerous... But I too wanted to risk it...  If only I had...) Ori!
Don't leave me! >

			'Who can stop the rain', AsiA


	 It was a beautiful day at ... no, not the Masaki shrine. I'm _not_
Tenchi and probably never will be (in some ways I still do envy him... in
other ways definitely not. But don't we all?). Still, in my dreams I may
have been him - or rather like him - sometimes...

         Oh, what the heck. It was _not_ a beautiful day! It was raining
'cats and dogs', and I was bored out of my mind. Well, as long as I'm
telling this, I guess I can try to describe myself in the meantime. I
didn't consider myself all that special physically: Overweight (Okay,
fat. Almost three hundred pounds. Satisfied?) but somewhat tall - a bit
over six feet. No athletic ability. Oh, well... no drive in that area.
 No style in clothes. No beard. Dark hair. Dark brown eyes. (Except for
the face - smaller nose, no glasses - this description sounds a bit like
Tenchi's friend from school, doesn't it?)
	 But mentally I regarded myself as okay. Not perfect - I don't
believe in perfection - but okay. Hey, I love Anime, any kind of fantasy
or science fiction I can get my hands on, and Role Playing Games.
	Okay by my book.
 	About thirty-three at the turn of the millennium, but looking
- and feeling - younger. Described as a genius by some...  heck, genius
is useless without applying it on something useful. 

<A: Ori! Please, come back!>

<O: ... Arraye?... have... to... do something...>

 	 Oh, who am I kidding. I'm just rambling away baring my soul
to complete strangers I probably will never meet or hear from and just
avoiding the Issue. Instead of reciting my life's story, which anyways
probably nobody will care for,  I shall begin anew:

*The Signal Is On Its Way -  1 : 10 to the power of 11 and falling...*

	 It all started with thinking. Does this prove something? 
I don't really know, so don't ask me...

	 It was a dark and rainy day. A weekend. The weekly RPG session 
had gotten canceled by my players due to the flu, and I was a bit bored. 
	 I just had created a RPG 'superhero' character based on myself 
(extrapolated into the system, of course) without expecting to ever get
a chance to play him/me, but it had been fun.

<A: I guess now one knows what drew the signal...>

<O: _I_ guess we'll have to discuss cause and effect for timelines again...>

<A: You're back!>

<O: ... Not really... persistent... *echo drifting away*... >

<A: OH, NO!>

	 I spent a while thinking about the nature of reality - is
there an objective reality? are there multiple ones? what might shape
or influence them? - but I may return to that topic sometime else.
	I recalled a few of my favorite books - Heinlein's Number
of the Beast, deCamp's Mathemagic series, Eddings' Belgariad and
Malloreon, Asprins Myth series... - and fantasized a bit about
some of their aspects.
	Especially deCamp's symbolic logic ideas... but I'm getting
ahead of myself again.
	... I apologize for ranting. It may happen again...

	Well, that's two of four things.

	The other two were: thinking about a more or less ridiculous
but still fascinating idea - truly 'virtual' memory and storage
management based on an idea about 'three-dimensional' information
correlations. And watching Anime. I put one of my favorite tapes
in the VCR - Tenchi Muyo, of course - and relaxed. If it sounds
as if I did all these things simultaneously, sorry. I just spent a few
hours - but sequentially, mostly at least.
	I just leaped from one thought to the next...

*The Signal Is On Its Way -  1 : 10 to the power of 5 and falling...*

<A: If this goes on, I'll _have_ to interfere, no matter what happens...
 (If he is fully caught... The loop will dissolve his core identity... Sh##!
Here we are, twisting time and space around the finger, but what use 
is it if we can't avoid traps like this one?) >

	I never before had had a flood of thoughts like this.
	It was as if some mind immeasurably superior to my own
had contacted me and tried to tell me something. While on screen
Washu tried to explain the structure of the mirror world to an
uncomprehending Mihoshi, I suddenly saw the complex drawing
become sharper, more focused and more complex. Overlaid I _saw_
my own prior thoughts taking form - an incredibly complex lattice
of lights and colors representing the mathematical ideas I had
faked postulating to myself as well as the pseudological series
of processes I only had imagined to imagine, if you get my meaning.

	In any case, this was the moment I simply 'lost'
one level of imagination. 
	What I had only imagined to imagine 
became just imagination. Somehow I _understood_
what I had only pretended to know...

	I just _can't_ describe it in another way...

*The Signal Is On Its Way -  1 : 10 to the power of 3 and falling...*

	Suddenly, the screen flickered. Somewhere seemingly deep
inside a blue-white spiral of light was appearing and growing.

	"What the..."

	Just as suddenly as it appeared, the spiral flashed 
in bright light and filled the screen completely with its
hypnotically pulsing rotation.

*The Signal Has Arrived!*

	The image collapsed into a bright, glowing dot.
	Before any movement or comment could be made, 
a sharp beam of light lanced out of the dot on the screen
towards my forehead, burning energy deep into my brain.

   	It hurt like hell, of course. What did you think?
Try giving yourself a lobotomy with a white-hot knitting 
needle and you don't need to ask!

	Then everything really got weird.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*****	Not really necessary Excourse: Due to the not fully
understood laws governing the flow, frequency and amplitude,
among everything else, of the energies involved, the following
happened (very simplified):

	The enormous energy tapped and rechanneled - just
imagine taking a small stone away from under a delicately 
balanced titanic boulder - behaved in an unexpected manner. 
	The higher-constant universe -so to say -_rejected_ 
the change being forced into it. 
	Instead a few very low-constant, temporary or rather
in certain ways limited parallel realities were _created_,
able to contain the energy without affecting the stability
of its 'parent'. *****

<A: Ori? Is that you?>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	I didn't lose conciousness as far as I can remember, but
without warning I had a kind of OOBE - an 'out-of-body-experience'.
	Everything became translucent. I felt like falling, but
instead of crashing down I kind of hovered. 
	And then I saw myself.

	Multiple times.

	And every self was different. Here I still sat in front
of the TV, apparently oblivious to everything else. This one
faded away almost as fast as it had appeared. There I stood
in front of a few score of listeners, wearing a suit and speaking.
There I sat on an exotic-looking chair, wearing colorful silk
robes, eyes rolled upward and trembling. Another me slept under
a bridge, rolled in newspapers. There was one double, clothed in
stylish but practical clothes, who also seemed to hover and to
look at me with an expression of pity in his/my face. Still
another me apparently was involved with several girls in...
	ummm...
	Let's just say it looked like being just on the thin h
line between serious fun and life-threatening overexertion.

	Then the next level appeared. Dozens of figures apparently 
connected to me by some kind of immaterial strings. The weirdest
thing was, most of them reminded me of several of my own RPG
characters and NPCs, male, female or neither, human or not,
fantasy or SF.

	And there were more. Somehow I did recognize 
myself in any one of them, no matter how different they looked. 
Whether big or thin, old or young, ugly or attractive, whatever 
the clothes, bodily or facial differences. Even the really weird
selves, with fur or antennae...
	Then there were the scenes... me in front of a thin,
cute, red-haired girl, between us a globe of red light?...
a young girl with forehead marks in front of a giant glowing
crystal tree?... a light-haired, ageless seeming man with...
tiny glasses... ???
	I recognized them all (Did you?), but I guess that's
also when I really lost track of it all.

	Then all these were... gone. For a moment I felt like
somebody had had fun playing hopscotch on my central 
nervous system, then I had hallucinations, then... nothing.
	"Where were you when they handed out the brains?" 
a voice from the TV asked.

   	"Thanks Washu", I grumbled,
	"... might as well be really talking to me!"

	 #No, not... yet#, a voice answered.

	I jerked up and looked around before realizing there
was something weird about that voice. Nobody was around.
	And the weird thing about that voice was, it appeared
to have sounded within my head.
	"Is there anybody?" Yeah, stupid question, I know,
but would _you_ have had a cool quote ready?

	#Not really... But I _am_ talking to you. Listen, I don't
know how much *time* we have. I need your help. No time to
explain, but you will be rewarded. Please, try to open your
mind and *sense* mine.#

	"Huh?" I guess I wasn't so brilliant now...
	Well, either I was dreaming or... actually, no 'or'.
	I didn't do drugs except tobacco, there was nobody who 
would (or could) play such a practical joke on me and I absolutely 
had no reason to turn _that_ insane last time I checked. So I just 
decided to go with the flow.
	"Oh... okay."

	#It might help if you looked in a mirror...# 

	So I did. The results I have described already.
	Then I tried to 'open my mind', while the voice - sounding
suspiciously similar to my own - gave me further 'helpful' advice, 
like "#just stare, like trying to scrutinize a stereogram picture#".

	Ever noticed how easy impossible things seem while you
are dreaming? Like flying? Just stretch that rarely used muscles
deep in your shoulders or back...

	Well, it wasn't that easy now. But somehow, after a
while - I had almost convinced myself - the SF and Fantasy fan -
that I was dreaming up an telepathic alien or magic contact -
something happened.

	I saw myself in the mirror, but somewhat changed.

	More mature, more athletic, a bit better looking.

	Nice for a dream...  For almost a full minute I stared at it.

	Then I blinked.

	Then my mind exploded. 

	My brain began to switch into overdrive.

	Then it accelerated.

	Then, just for the fun of it, it activated afterburners.

	And then (for the first, but not the last time) it
_really_ began to pick up speed.

<A: Oh gods... I _have_ to try to stop that chaos...
*initiating... something*>

	 As far as I can remember, that was the moment my
imagination twisted and grasped outward through a few dozen
realities and picked up bits and pieces from other minds out
there and put them together. Maybe to help me.

	 I guess my subconscious doesn't really like me at all...

	 But more about that later.

*fading away*>


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Meanwhile, elsewhere - whatever _that_ might mean 
under the given conditions...:

	A certain supercute, tiny, redhaired greatest
scientist of her universe
	- okay, yes, 'Little Washu' -
	had just completed her design of a new Probability
Miscegenation Scanner, when her new Mental Intrusion
Interceptor/Perceptor... 'miip'ed.
	She raised an eyebrow, then decided to open a
limited channel to scan the source of the signal.
	 Apparently, an extra- (higher-?!) dimensional
mentality was desperately calling for help... structure...
integrity... identity... a pattern... anything.

	Faster than the fission speed of an Uranium-235
nucleus in a neutronically saturated environment (don't
blame me, that's _her_ comparison) she analyzed the situation,
deduced several implications, extrapolated a few conclusions,
decided to be in the mood for it and made a decision.
	There were already infinite parallel versions of her
out there in the other dimensions, so why not influence the
forming of a new mind _begging_ for it by imprinting it with
a tiny bit of her vastly superior, incredibly imaginative,
amazingly flexible, remarkably caring and of course
unearthly cute intellect?
	And, just in case - it seems to be still choosing 
a physical form too - with a tiny hint of her own (grin) 
indescribably good looks?

	With a touch of a few holographic keys she uploaded
an (edited) copy of her own mental and astral patterns (and
a few others) and set it to 'read only access granted' while
tuning the access to the mental call as well as implanting a
tendency to seek out her original patterns as a kind of
'homing instinct' to get a chance to check the results. 
	At least, that was what she intended.

	Just at that moment the door opened, the crab-shaped
bell clinked, and Washu's face assumed a horrified expression
as a blonde face peeked in (further distracting her by setting
a new precedent by just entering her subspace lab completely
normally and harmlessly through the door) causing her to flinch
and to hit the wrong button.
	When she realized she had just uploaded _all_ the
experimentally (also edited) stored patterns she had put 
within that directory, which meant of _all_ the females 
in the house (_including_ exactly _that one_ from the 
blonde terror who just had entered her lab)...  0_0;;;

	"MIIIHOOOSHIII!!!" 
	"Yes?" (Blinkblink)

	Oh, well... it probably was fate... or there _is_ a god
(at least one with a twisted sense of humor...).

	And just for a few minutes more Washu _seriously_
considered inventing some kind of treatment for threatening 
acute Mihoshi-phobia...*

	It appeared hopeless to try to make something of this
wild jumble of incoherent thought. Apparently, whoever my opposite
was, he had similar experiences. Then he 'found' my memories of
the last RPG I had perused (you remember?) while I found something
he apparently didn't know consciously.

	Weird... It 'tasted' like the knowledge of a third or maybe
even fourth mind. I can't explain how I knew, but it changed a lot.
	I didn't really know what 'he' made of all this junk
rolling around in my brain - I was far too busy with trying to
sort the rest of it, including the new stuff.

<O: (tonelessly, from far away) So I did not notice the glow
of quantum energies beginning to spread over me, rewriting
until now unneccessary sections of my DNA and rearranging
the energy balance of every subatomic particle in my body...>

<A: (just as tonelessly and from afar) While our presence
busts into the causality happening just now changing events
never having happened into those probably never meant to
happen but which we remember, at least parts of it...>

<O: (As above...) Neither did I register what happened next,
especially not the multiversal part of it...>

*While the room waved and quavered like a heatwave or fata
morgana, out of thin air another body formed and gracelessly
flopped down on the limp shape surrounded by the quickly
fading glow. Invisible energies drew from an infinity of
sources and imprinted themselves on a pristine brain.*

	When I regained some semblance of awareness, first
I became aware I was lying down flat.
	Then I noticed I had some difficulty breathing.

	 Half-opening my eyes, I saw a beautiful girl lying
across my body.
	"Woww... I either am dreaming, or dead and gone 
to heaven."
	Slowly I freed my right hand from beneath her legs
and proceeded to put both of us into a more comfortable
position while I couldn't take my gaze off her.
	She was beautiful, in a strange but also strangely
familiar way, making me forget all the previous events.
	 She was small, barely... hmm... five feet?
Less than ninety pounds? It was hard to judge while
she laid limply there.
	But she was nicely shaped... She looked... oh, darn,
I'm horrible with estimating ages... about twenty maybe, I
guess, but she could just as easily have been fourteen
or so... there was something about her letting her appear
terribly young.
	She had an incredibly full head of hair, styled in
a strange way... most of it looked spiky and stood up almost
straight, but still felt soft, just strong, like that of a
cat... but there also were a few long, wavy tresses flowing
down along the sides of her face. The hair was colored in
several strange shades, which nevertheless looked quite
natural on her...

	Some kind of a very dark, full red with a purple shade?
With a somewhat metallic highlight of a golden green?
	What was I seeing? How was that possible?
	And how could _that_ look 'natural'?

	Then I forgot all these questions again as she moved,
putting my fears of her being hurt or even worse to rest.
	She almost purred and snuggled up to me, still 
not really awakening.
	 My heart tried its best to leap up through my throat
(probably to get a better look).
	I couldn't take my gaze off her.
	I never had such a girl cozying up to me like that...
	Unexpectedly I felt very protective.
	I just softly hugged her, cautiously, like holding
a small child.

	Well, she just as easily could have been one, with
her slight, lean body almost disappearing below that jungle
of hair making her head appearing even larger.
	She had an almost elfin, somewhat oriental face, with
high cheekbones, a small and very cute nose and lips and
beautifully proportioned chin and neck. Her closed lids began
to flutter a bit, momentarily revealing large, still a bit
glazed eyes.
	Slowly she appeared to wake up, looking up through
half-closed eyes and taking a deep breath. 

	Then she screamed.

	And I discovered the secret of assisted flight. Not too 
far, just two paces, into the wall and back to the ground. 
	(Oh, the wall decided it was the real genius of all those 
involved and gave way. Somehow _I_ didn't.) 

	Things just threatened to go downhill very fast 
from that point...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


*'Beaming' sound effects*

<A (very small voice): what did we do? did we really 
just now meddle with our own creation?>

<O (quietly, but a bit ironic): If so, we also really may have 
been responsible for creating all existence, when we once 
tried to go back to the Ultimate Beginning of Everything...>

<A (still very small voice): ... scary  thought...>

<O (relaxed): Phew! Whatever happened, let's forget it, 
we're back again!>

<A: Owww... (small voice again) my head's spinning...>

<O: We just were too close to the events. Whatever...
We can't stop now. Not anymore.>
