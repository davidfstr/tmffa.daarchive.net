          As you know, I don&#8217;t own Gundam Wing or Tenchi
          Muyo.  But the fic is
          mine.  Enjoy!

          Prolouge

          Note:  This is an alternative universe fic, this takes
          place where
          The Colonies and Planet Jurai exist at the same time.
           Just to let
          you know!

               Wufei paced back and forth nervously.  This had to
          be the only
          time he had been this nervous since his marriage to
          Ayeka.  He stood
          outside her door, waiting patiently for the birth of his
          first
          child.  He couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, he had to go
          in and see her.
          Since her hand maidens weren&#8217;t with her and
          neither was her mother or
          sister.  At the moment he had a chance to see her.  She
          had gone into
          labor last night and he hadn&#8217;t seen her since
          then.

               Careful not to make a sound, he opened the door as
          quietly as
          possible and crept in.

               Ayeka laid on her back, sprawled out on the bed.
           She wasn&#8217;t
          crying like most women would.  She seemed very calm.
           Her eyes were
          closed as she kept her breathing steady.

              Wufei watched her, she was very strong indeed, not
          making a
          sound, or giving any indication that she was in pain.
           Slowly he made
          his way to her bedside.

              She opened her eyes and looked up at him.
           "What.....are you
          doing here?  Your......not.........supposed to be in
          here.  Do you
          have .........any idea of what ........mother would say
          if she saw
          you?"  Ayeka said in between deep breaths, but managed a
          faint smile.
          Wufei returned the smile, and took her hand in his,
          giving it a
          gentle squeeze.  "I had to check on you.  You
          didn&#8217;t think I would
          let my wife go through this alone did you?"
          She shook her head lightly.  "No Wufei, I wouldn&#8217;t
          have thought that."
          "Glad to hear it."  Wufei said, kneeling by her side,
          kissing her
          forehead.
          She squeezed his hand and leaned back into her pillow,
          letting out a
          few more gasps.

                Wufei studied her, wondering how she could handle
          such pain.
          A pain he would never experience.  He looked at her, she
          had changed
          so much since they first met two years ago.  Her
          appearance among
          others things had changed.  For starters.  Her hair was
          now all the
          same length, and it trailed down her back.  And she had
          developed a
          more stronger technique in Juraian Martial Arts.  He was
          about to say
          something else when........

              "Wufei.  What are you doing in here?"  He heard,
          then turned
          around to find Misaki standing in the doorway, hands on
          her hips,
          frowning at him.  "You know your not supposed to be in
          here.  Now
          shew......"  She gestured with her hand.
          He chuckled, then looked at Ayeka, who was giggling, and
          gave her
          hand another encouraging squeeze then got up and left
          the room,
          glancing back at her before Misaki closed the door
          behind him.

              Wufei folded his arms, sighing, he began walking
          toward the
          palace fountains, and sat on a bench, lifting his knees
          to his chest
          and hugging them.
          "Your highness."  Said a voice, he looked up to see
          Kamadake standing
          infornt of him.
          "What is it?"  Wufei questioned the red haired guard.
          "I came to inform you that your friends from Earth will
          be arriving
          shortly."
          Wufei nodded.  "Thank you for letting me know.  Please
          see to it that
          their quarters are ready."
          "Yes your highness."  Kamadake bowed then left.
          Wufei watched him go, then returned his gaze to the
          fountains,
          watching the patterns of the water.  He looked at his
          cloths, which
          were Juraian, but he designed them and had them made
          exactly the way
          he liked.  The outfit he wore was similar to his white
          silk suit, but
          different.  It had other designs, such as blue buttons,
          and silver
          dragons.  He also realized he had changed since he met
          Ayeka.  The
          only thing different about his appearance was that his
          hair was
          longer, which he still wore in a tight ponytail, which
          trailed down
          to his lower back.  Closing his eyes, he slowly calmed
          himself down,
          and was less nervous, as he remembered the time he first
          met Ayeka.

          2 years ago........

              Wufei walked through the halls to the throne room,
          Heero, Duo,
          Trowa, and Quatre following close behind.  This was his
          first visit
          to Jurai, and he was meeting his intended.  He had been
          awaiting this
          day ever since Master Long had informed him of this,
          that his father
          and Emperor Asuza of Jurai made an arrangement between
          their children.

             It was an act of honor.  His father had saved
          Asuza&#8217;s life long
          ago, and to show his gratefulness, he suggested that his
          daughter
          Ayeka marry his son.  And of course Wufei&#8217;s father
          had agreed.  To
          uphold his family&#8217;s Honor, Wufei was doing what
          was expected of him.

          "Your highness.  Wufei Chang."  Osaka informed the
          Emperor, as Wufei
          kneeled down.  The other Gundam Pilots bowed, unsure of
          what else to
          do.
          Asuza sat on his throne, and studied the Chinese youth
          from head to
          toe.  Satisfied with what he saw, he nodded once.
           "I&#8217;m very pleased
          to meet you finally Wufei."  He said.
          Wufei stood up and observed his future father in law.
           "And I you
          your majesty."
          Asuza leaned back in his throne, looking at the other
          Gundam Pilots,
          questioning.
          Wufei followed his gaze.  "Allow me to introduce my
          comrades.  Heero
          Yuy, Duo Maxwell, Trowa Barton, and Quatre Reberba
          Winner."  He said,
          pointing them out as he went along.
          The Emperor nodded again.  I welcome you to my kingdom
          young men."
          "Thank you very much you majesty."  Quatre smiled.
          "There will be a ball in honor of you and my
          daughter&#8217;s engagement
          Wufei.  You will meet here then."  Asuza informed them.
           "Your
          comrades are invited also.  And it is a formal affair,
          so if you need
          anything, let my guards know.  Osaka."
          "Yes your highness."  Osaka asked.
          "Please show them to their quarters."  Asuza requested.
          Osaka bowed.  "This way."  He said, gesturing for them
          to follow.

          Later that night........

                 Wufei leaned against a wall and watched the
          excitement around
          him.  All the nobles where there, and so was the rest of
          Jurai&#8217;s
          Royal Family.  His fellow pilots were present also.  And
          him and all
          his friends had dressed in Juraian formal cloths.

          "Man do I have to wear this."  Duo complained, pulling
          on the
          neckline of his shirt.  "This is worse than wearing a
          tuxedo."
          Trowa to a sip of his drink and observed the festivity
          silently.
          Quatre was in a deep conversation with one of the young
          Juraian lords.
          And Heero was doing pretty much the same thing Trowa
          was, but was
          leaning against the railing.  Watching the ballroom
          dancing.

               "Ah.  There you are Wufei."  Said Emperor Asuza as
          he
          approached them along with his two wives and his
          youngest
          daughter.  "I&#8217;d like you to meet my wives.
           Fanaho.  First Queen of
          Jurai.  Misaki, Second Queen, and my youngest daughter,
          Princess
          Sasami."
          "It&#8217;s nice to meet you Wufei."  Fanaho smiled,
          extending her hand,
          palm down.
          Wufei took her hand, and nodded.  "It&#8217;s a
          pleasure."
          He returned his attention to Misaki, the next thing he
          knew, she had
          him in a tight bear hug.  "Oh it&#8217;s so great to
          meet my future son in
          law."  She exclaimed, squeezing him even more.
          Wufei gasped for air, finally she let him go.  He looked
          at her
          startled, but politely nodded.  "Thank you your
          highness."
          She smiled.
          Sasami stepped up and curtseyed.  "Nice to meet you
          Wufei."  She
          giggled.
          Wufei studied her, and lightly smiled at the little
          girl.  And
          bowed.  "Like wise Princess Sasami."  He replied, then
          acknowledged
          his companions, who stood nearby, noticing the
          introductions, they
          all approached him.
          "I&#8217;d like you to meet my fellow team mates.  Heero
          Yuy, Duo Maxwell,
          Trowa Barton, and Quetre Reberba Winner."  He introduced
          each one and
          pointed them out.
          "It&#8217;s nice to meet all of you."  Fanaho smiled at
          them.
          "Hi There."  Misaki waved at them.
          "Hello."  Sasami smiled.
          They all bowed, and nodded.

              One the introductions had been made, Wufei turned
          his attention
          back to Asuza.
          "Princess Ayeka will be arriving shortly with her
          brother Yosho."
          Asuza said, then looked at the other Gundam Pilots.
           "Please enjoy
          yourselves."
          "Thank You very much your highness."  Quatre smiled.
          "Come Wufei, there are some other people I&#8217;d like
          you to meet."
          Asuza grinned.
          Wufei nodded and followed the Emperor, leaving his
          friends to mingle
          with the crowd.

              Wufei had met all of the Juraian Family, and finally
          weaseled
          his way out of the conversations around him, and went to
          look for his
          friends.  He found them at the bar.  Duo seemed a little
          lit, but not
          to much.  Heero and Trowa were still silently watching
          the crowds and
          Quatre was drinking another non alcoholic beverage.

          "So what have you all been up to tonight."  He asked as
          he approached
          them.
          "Enjoying myself."  Duo answered before ordering another
          glass of
          what he was drinking.
          "Meeting other people."  Quatre said, smiling.
          "Heero and Trowa didn&#8217;t say anything at first.
          "Just watching on."  Heero replied.
          "Same here."  Trowa added.
          Wufei raised his eye brows and sat down beside Duo who
          was downing
          his drink.  "I don&#8217;t know what this is, but
          it&#8217;s good stuff."  He
          grinned.
          Wufei looked at him, arching his eyebrow, then returned
          his gaze to
          the dance floor.

               A moment later the music stopped, and Emperor Asuza
          stood up
          from his throne.  While Fanaho and Misaki remained
          seated.
          "I&#8217;d like to thank you all for coming to my
          daughter&#8217;s engagement
          ball."  He said to the awaiting crowd.  "Now, I feel it
          is time that
          Wufei meet his future bride.&#8217;
          "I think that&#8217;s your Que."  Duo said.
          "You think."  Wufei frowned at him before making his way
          to the
          throne where the Emperor stood.

              Wufei stood infront of Emperor Asuza and once again
          bowed.
          "My people, this Wufei, the future Crown Prince of
          Jurai."
          The crowd nodded.
          "Now Wufei, my I present to you my daughter.  Princess
          Ayeka.  Your
          future bride."  Asuza said as the crowd parted, and a
          figure
          approached them, wearing a sliver kimono like outfit,
          with aqua
          designs, and a peach sash.  A silver robe covered the
          rest of her
          body from head to toe, and a silver veil hung from her
          tiara,
          covering her face.

          "Wonder what&#8217;s she&#8217;s hiding under that
          veil?"  Duo blurted out loud.
          "Be quiet you idiot."  Heero scolded.
          "Opps."  Duo grinned sheepishly, then remained silent.

              Ayeka continued to walk forward until she reached
          the throne,
          stopping infront of Wufei, facing him.
          "Now Wufei, lift up the veil, and see your future
          bride."  Asuza
          instructed.
          Wufei did as he was told, and carefully lifted the veil,
          pushing it
          over her head, and gazed at her.

                She had very delicate features.  Her eyes were an
          intense
          violet red, and her cheekbones high.  She was the most
          beautiful
          woman he had ever laid eyes on.  He stepped back and
          extended his
          hand.  She looked at him, then placed her hand in his.
          The crowd then cheered.
