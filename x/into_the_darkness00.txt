Universe.

	Into the Darkness: Prologue

It was a cloudy, overcast day at the Misaki household. In a most unusual twist, the house 
was not being battered by explosions, the reason being that all the inhabitants of said 
house, with the exception of Katshuhito, Nobyuki, and Ryo-ohki were in Washu's lab, 
where she was busily showing off her rebuilt Dimensional Tuner.
"And this time I've installed several fail-safes to prevent incidents like the last one from 
occurring again" The diminutive redhead cackled, casting a rather significant look at 
Mihoshi, Ryoko, and Ayeka. "Gee, that's great but are the shackles really necessary?"  
Tenchi asked, indication the restraints with which Washu had immobilized them so she 
could show her invention off without fear of any escape attempts. "Of course they are 
Tenchi! And while we're here why don't you let me have that sample?" 
"OVER YOUR DEAD BODY!!" shrieked Ryoko and Ayeka.
"Hey hey, no need to get so upset, I was only kidding"
"Ohh. What does this button do?"
"Mihoshi! How did you get out of those restraints?!?"
"Umm I opened them up?"
"NOOO!!! Don't press that!!"
The house shuddered as a gigantic blast ripped through it.

The Wing Zero class gundam plowed through the forest, annihilating anything that got in 
it's path. As she observed the carnage her gundam was causing, the purple-haired, 
crimson-eyed young woman let out a sadistic laugh "oh ho ho ho ho."
