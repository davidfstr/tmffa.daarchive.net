          By Lady_Allure

          A crossover between Gundam Wing and Tenchi Muyo.

          I don&#8217;t own Gundam Wing or Tenchi Muyo, I&#8217;m
          just borrowing them for a
          bit.  But the fic is mine!  Enjoy!

          Chapter 1: Meeting Gundam Pilots

                    Ayeka gasped as she stared at the two figures
          laying on
          her floor.  She studied them.  Both looked to be around
          the same age
          as her, one had long brown hair tied into a braid, the
          other had jet
          black hair tied into a tight ponytail.  She could see
          that one was
          dressed in some sort of black body suit, the other in a
          blue tang top
          with white pants.
               Slowly she approached them, kneeling down on one
          knee, she
          looked at the one with black hair.  She studied his
          face.  He was
          very handsome.  She was about to take a look at the
          other when she
          heard a slight moan come from the one infront of her.
           Suddenly he
          bolted up into a sitting position, glaring at her.
          "Who are you?&#8217;  He demanded, standing up, looking
          down at her, his
          fists clenched.
          Before she could answer, she felt arms encircle around
          her waist,
          holding her in a tight grip.
          "Let me go!"  She said, struggling to free herself.
          "Not until you tell us who you are Lady."  Said the
          voice of her
          offender.
          "I said let go!"  She yelled, counter acting his hold on
          her, and
          flipping him over.
          "Ow.  Man how many times am I going to be tossed
          around?"  Duo said,
          getting up from the floor, pushing his bangs from his
          face, staring
          at the girl.
          Wufei watched, not the least impressed.  "Really Duo.
           I&#8217;m sure you
          could handle this woman can&#8217;t you?"
          Duo looked at him, his eyebrows arched.  "I don&#8217;t
          know.  She&#8217;s one
          tough cookie."
          Wufei frowned at his friend, then looked at the girl in
          front of
          him.  "She looks like just another weakling to me."
          Ayeka glared at him.  "How dare you say such things
          about me."  She
          said through clenched teeth.  "Osaka, Kamidake!"
          "Yes your highness."  Said two log shape figures that
          appeared
          suddenly.
          She smirked.  "Teach these boys a lesson.  They should
          know better
          than to insult me."
          "As you wish your majesty."  They agreed, turning their
          attention on
          the to the two Gundam Pilots.
          "Uh.....Wufei.  I think it&#8217;s time we made a run
          for it."  Duo
          stammered, moving back a bit, watching the two logs come
          closer.
          Wide eyed.
          Wufei scowled at the girl and back at his comrade.  "You
          hide behind
          logs.  How cowardly."  He said smartly, then turned and
          began to run,
          Duo following him.
          That last remark angered the Princess and she clenched
          her
          fist.  "Osaka, Kamidake, after them."  She ordered,
          pointing in the
          direction they had went.
          "Yes your highness."  They said, the hurried after the
          two.

          "What is going on here?"  Duo exclaimed as him and Wufei
          ran down a
          hallway.
          "How should I know."  Wufei replied, glancing back,
          finding the two
          logs following not far behind.  "But we&#8217;d better
          run faster."
          Duo looked back, frowning.  "Oh great."  He said
          sarcastically,
          keeping his pace beside his team mate.
          "Stop right there."  Osaka commanded, catching up to
          them.
          "You forgot to say please."  Duo joked.
          Wufei rolled his eyes and shook his head, continuing to
          run.  "This
          is no time for jokes you idiot."  He said.
          "We command you to stop!"  Osaka and Kamidake shouted,
          catching up to
          them and putting a force field around them.
          "What in the world......"  Duo frowned.  "I can&#8217;t
          move."  He said,
          feeling himself being lifted off the ground, Wufei
          beside him.

          Osaka and Kamidake dropped the two into the center of a
          grass field,
          and watched the tree branches seal themselves around
          them.
          "That should hold them until Princess Ayeka arrives."
           Kamidake
          stated.
          "Indeed."  Osaka agreed and followed his fellow guard,
          leaving them
          in the room.

          "Hey you.  Let us out of here.  We didn&#8217;t do
          anything to you."  Duo
          yelled after them as they exited the room, holding his
          hands against
          the tree branches.  "Man what king of place is this
          anyway?"
          "Hmph."  Wufei muttered, seating himself onto the grass,
          leaning
          against the branches, crossing his arms.
          Duo looked at him, shocked that he was so calm about
          their situation.
          "Wufei.  Where do you think we are?"  He asked, sitting
          down also,
          scratching his head.  "Last thing I remember was looking
          up at the
          stars back on the ship."
          Wufei shrugged.  "I haven&#8217;t got a clue."

                Ayeka awaited the return of her guards, running a
          comb through
          her hair while she waited.
          "Princess, we&#8217;ve caught them.  They are being held
          by the tree
          branches out in the gardens."  Osaka and Kamidake
          informed her from
          her doorway.
          She nodded.  "Well done.  I guess I shall pay them a
          visit and find
          out just who they are."  Ayeka fixed her sash and left
          the room,
          accompanied by her guards.

          Duo paced back and forth, restless.  "How long are we
          gonna stay in
          here anyway?"  He asked no one in particular.
          Wufei shrugged, but didn&#8217;t say anything, still
          seated. Then he heard
          foot steps approaching and stood up, waiting for the
          person to come
          into view.  He then saw that it was the girl who sent
          those strange
          logs after him and Duo.
          She approached them,  staring at them, frowning
          slightly.
                 Wufei studied her.  She had purple hair that was
          cut in a
          very odd hairstyle.  Short on top, with two very long
          pig tails
          trailing down her back.  Her eyes were deep red violet,
          and she wore
          a strange outfit.  It looked like a kimono, but was
          designed
          differently, framing her slim figure.  Peach with silver
          designs.
          And she wore a tiara over her forehead.  She was indeed
          very
          beautiful, but that was besides the point.

          "Just exactly who are you?"  She asked a moment later.
          Wufei arched his eyebrows and looked away, arms folded.
          Duo stared at him and shook his head, then looked at
          her, faintly
          smiling.
          "My name is Duo Maxwell, and this is Wufei Chang."  He
          introduced
          himself, and pointed at his companion.
          Her eyes narrowed at Wufei, no courtesy.  But she nodded
          at Duo.
          "I am Ayeka.  First Crown Princess of Jurai.  I take it
          you mean no
          harm to my kingdom."
          "Jurai."  Duo frowned in confusion.  "What is that?"
          Ayeka giggled, they were no threat at all.  "You are on
          Jurai.  My
          home planet."
          Duo raised his eyebrows.  "Planet.  Goodness,
          how&#8217;d we get here?"
          "We will find that out soon enough.  For now, I will
          show you to your
          rooms."  Ayeka answered, using her tiara to release them
          from the
          vines.  "Follow me."
          Duo looked at her, confused, but followed her anyway.
           Wufei right
          behind him.

          "I think we had a misunderstanding earlier."  Ayeka
          said, walking up
          a set of stairs, followed by two Gundam Pilots.
          "Yeah.  I guess I over reacted."  Duo agreed, grinning
          slightly.  "I
          didn&#8217;t mean to grab you the way I did."
          "And I am deeply sorry for losing my temper.  I
          didn&#8217;t hurt you did
          I?"  She asked, glancing at him.
          "Lady, it takes a lot to hurt a Gundam Pilot."  Duo
          smirked.
          Wufei elbowed him in the rubs once he said this.
          "Ow.  What did you do that for!"  Duo frowned at him.
          "You know why.  No one is supposed to know what we are.
           Besides.  We
          don&#8217;t know enough about her."
          "Gundam Pilot?"  Ayeka arched her eyebrow, stopping and
          staring at
          the two.
          "It&#8217;s none of your business."  Wufei said.
           "Forget what he said
          Woman."
          Ayeka glared at him.  "My name is Ayeka.  And I&#8217;d
          prefer it if you
          called me that.  And you must not have any manners.  Be
          glad that I&#8217;m
          being lenient with you.  Or if you prefer, I could put
          you back into
          the vines again."
          Wufei was about to say something but Duo beat him to it.
          "Um......Your highness.  Please forgive him.  He
          sometimes lets his
          pride over run him.  And about what I said earlier, well
          it must
          remain a secret, for your safety."  Duo smiled faintly.
          Ayeka eyed him suspiciously, but nodded.  "Very well.  I
          will not
          question you about it, however, I am not so sure about
          my father."
          She replied, and continued up the stairs.

                When they reached the third floor, she lead them
          each to their
          own separate rooms.  First she showed Wufei his room,
          then Duo, who&#8217;s
          room was right next door.
          "This is your room."  Ayeka said, opening the door and
          leading him in.
          "Wow.  This is some room."  Duo raised his eyebrows,
          looking around
          the huge room, that had a big window right next to the
          very large
          bed, along with a dresser, private bathroom, mirror, and
          a closet
          full of male Juraian cloths.
          Ayeka smiled.  "I very pleased you like it.  I shall
          leave you now.
          Should you need  anything, let my servants know."  And
          she turned,
          and began walking towards the door.
          "Wait."  Duo said.
          "Huh?"  She asked, stopping, and looking at him.
          "What did you mean earlier?  He asked.
          "About what?  Ayeka arched her eyebrow.
          "You father, or something like that."  Duo shrugged.
          Ayeka chuckled lightly.  "My father would like to meet
          you both, that
          is, you will have to answer his questions.  And believe
          me, you don&#8217;t
          want to make him suspicious."  With that, she turned and
          walked out,
          closing the door behind her.  Leaving Duo very nervous.

                 Ayeka walked out into the open fields, where the
          Juraian
          flowers grew.  She sat down and picked a flower.  She
          smiled at the
          look on Duo&#8217;s face.  He seemed nervous once she
          mentioned her
          father.  But, he was away on a trip along with Fanaho
          and Misaki at a
          neighboring Kingdom.  In a way, she was glad they were
          away.  For
          some reason, these two stangers interested her very
          much.  They were
          different.  She could tell they were human, but not like
          any she had
          ever met.

          And that&#8217;s Chapter 1.  Comments and ideas please!
