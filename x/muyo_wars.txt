		     Chapter One: Usagi
Usagi awoke. She was still asleep, in away. She truned around to 
find Mamoru laying there next to her. She cuddled up with him. She 
then flet his arms wrap around her. She smiled at leaned her head 
on his chest.
Mamoru kiss her forhead. "Good morning Usako."
Usagi looked into his eyes. "Good morning."
Mamoru drew her closer to him. He did not know what was better 
then having Usagi next to him every morning. He sat up and headed 
toward the closet. 
Usagi turned her head, even though they where married she was not 
use to seeing him get dressed. She thanked each day that he was 
there with her. Since he had died in the battle with Galaxia she 
had made sure he would come back. She would make sure of it. 
"Mamoru." she began. "Since it is Saturday do you wanna do 
something?"
Mamoru stared at her. He smiled knowing that she would not look at 
him until he was dress. "I do have to go to work......" he truned 
away. "for an hour."
Usagi looked his way. She was distpointed. "You said you had 
weekends off."
Mamoru laughed. "Usako it is only an hour," he glanced at her. "60 
mintues of 24 hours."
Usagi glared at him. "I do know how to read time!" she raised her 
voice. She giggled. "Ok, I'll spare sixty minutes if you make 
breakfest."
"Deal." Mamoru said. He bent down and kissed her forhead. 
"Besides, who would I spend sixty minutes with besides you? Well 
maybe with ChibiUsa."
Usagi nodded. "Just promise me..." she asked putting her face 
closer to his. "No more than three mirrors."
Mamoru stared at her and sat down next to her. Her face was 
loward. "Usako, that was a long time ago."
Usagi brought her head up. "But....." 
Mamoru put his finger over her lips. "A long time ago. Lets forget 
it." he sat up and left.
Usagi looked at the ground. 'Yes.' she said to herself. 'A long 
time ago, but what if she ecsaps form her mirror?' she shivered. 
'Or worse what if her daughter comes back?' Usagi put her robe on 
and walked down the stairs.
She stopped by the bathroom and whashed her face. 'Maybe... Mamoru 
is right? I might be afarid to lose him.' she looked in the 
mirror. A different face was there. She looked and blinked. She 
then walked very fast down the stairs. 
The aroma of chesse omlets filled the air. Usagi stodd next to 
Mamoru. She looked at the calaneder. Next week was when ChibiUsa 
would come home. Also next week was Mamoru's brithday. "Well since 
you are going to work...." Usagi looked at him. "I guess me and 
the others should window shoping for a a person, who remane 
nameless, whose brithday is next week?"
Mamoru looked at the calander. "Already?" he looked at Usagi. She 
was allready sereving out the orange juice. "Usako, grab some 
plates."
Usagi had allready done that. She even had the silverwear out. She 
smiled. "Mamoru, me and the girls where going to throw a party for 
ChibiUsa." she looked at him. "I got a note form Setsuna saying 
that ChibiUsa and Elios are married."
"Good for her!" Mamoru smiled. "I think Elios is a perfect 
husband."
Usagi agreed. "Besides, who else would you let ChibiUsa marry?" 
she wrote something on the calaneder. "Well I can think of people 
to come to the party. Ami, Rei, Makoto, Minako, Haruka, Michiru, 
Setsuna and Hotura. Anyone else?"
"Luna, Artemis." Mamoru said while serving the food. "And Diana 
but ChibiUsa is probley bringing her with her." 
Usagi nodded. She wrote everyone's name on a papper. "Lets see. 
Ami may not beable to come since she is a doctor now. Rei and Chad 
are parcticing the rotine for the party. Makoto can make the 
gooides." she paused. "Minako..... could bring the guys?"
Mamoru laughed. "Maybe. She could get people that went to school 
with there."
"Yeah." Usagi agreed. "Haruka would stand around. Michiru said she 
would play the voilin when Rei is singing. Setsuna could check the 
names on a list, and Hotaru can be a suprise."
------------------------------------------------------------
Makoto, Ami, Minako and Rei sat at Rei's temple waiting for Usagi. 
"Well at least one thing about Usagi is still the same." Rei 
laughed.
Makoto saw Usagi. "You can tell it is her because of the 
meatballs." she looked in her backpack. "I brought some cookies."
Minako took one. "Well you still bring treats!" she chugged it 
down.
"You know Minako." Ami said. "You need a check up."
Minako stared at her. "You have not changed at bit!"
Rei gasped. "Look!" she pointed to Usagi and Mamoru.
Ami lefted an eyebrow. "Yes?"
Minako and Makotot gasped. "They... are kissing!"
True enough before Usagi got out of the car they kissed each 
other. "If we are not hear by the time we get back, we'll probley 
be shopping." 
Mamoru nodded the drove off.
Makoto ran done the stairs. "Usagi! You kissed him!" 
Usagi looked troubled. "So? He have been married for three years 
now."
Makoto offered her a cookie. "So why did you call us?"
"Well ChibiUsa's party is next week." Usagi said. "And I needed to 
know what you where all doing, to make sure I got it right."
Ami pulled out a list. "Well I am going. I am going to desine 
games."
Rei laughed. "Ami! ChibiUsa would be a grown, or almost, woman."
Ami blushed. "Sorry."
Usagi walked in Rei's room with the others. She then looked in the 
mirror. Her own refecltion.
Rei put her hands on Usagi's shoulders. "Are you alright?"
Usagi nodded. "When I was in the bathroom another face was in 
there."
Rei looked to her friends. "But Nephiria, is trapped forever."
Usagi nodded. "But...... it was like a younger version of her."
---------------------------------------------------------------
Mamoru stopped at a store. He walked around then saw a iteam. He 
picked it up. "I wonder if ChibiUsa would like it."
"Well it seems you have your sites on a very old statue." the 
clerk said. "Said that any man that touched it would fall in love 
with her."
Mamoru put it down. "Her?"
"Princess Kimon." the clerk told him. "It is also said that a 
little mirror inside captures a mans heart, but I do not beleave 
it."
"Maybe you should." a female voice said.
Mamoru spun around. And looked at the girl. She had dark red hair 
tintied with black and wore a uniform. "Who are you?"
"I am Kyamin." the woman said. She picked up the iteam and touched 
a jewel on it. "It is also said, a man and a woman kind find each 
other and fall in love." she gave it to Mamoru. "We are having a 
sale today. 40% off."
Mamoru took it and noticed a painting. "What is that?"
"Oh," Kyamin said. "That is one of the last pictures of the 
Princess & Prince sereies. The girl in it the daughter of the 
Prince of the Earth and the Princess of the Moon." she then went 
to the counter. "I am about to get off of work. Would you like to 
be that?"
Mamoru looked down at the statue of the maiden. "Uh I do not think 
my wife's cousin would like it for a wedding gift."  
Kyamin nodded. "I think not." she walked to the room.
Mamoru walked out and got in the car. He saw out of the corner of 
his eye a woman watching him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A laugh filled the air. "Kinute! Get that man!"
"Kill him ma'am?"
"NO." the voice said. "Make him mine."
"But he did not buy the object......"
"But...." the voice snapped. "Did he tuch it?"
"Yes ma'am."
"Now, wait tonight, then effect his dreams........"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Usagi looked into a window. "I don't think Mamoru is intrested in 
this kinda thing." She pulled herself away and looked at her 
friends. 
"How about a docter or someother kind of book?" Ami suggested.
Usagi made a funny face. "No, he has a libary you know."
Rei saw something. She walked over to it. "Dose he like moives?"
Usagi walked over. "He has all those."
"Shopping for men is diffecalt." Minako pointed out.
"You are not even shopping!" Makoto said. "Usagi, how about a rice 
cooker?"
Usagi blinked. "Uh..... I do not know."
Ami looked at her. "Why do you just wait until he you know points 
something out then buy it?"
Usagi looked at the others. They where nodding. "Ok."
"Why don't we go to the movies?" Minako suggested.
"Why?" Rei said. "So you can look at cute clerks?"
Minako blushed. "Well.... hu...... I wanted to see a moive, 
toghter like we used to."
Usagi nodded. "I mean we have not been toghter lately."
Rei looked down. "Me and Chad are going on tour this year."
"You finally got a hit?" Minako asked.
"Are you a lead singer?" Makoto asked.
"I am the one who rights the songs." Rei said.
A beeping noise filled the air. "Hi meatball head." a girl said. 
"Long time no see."
"Haruka!" Usagi said. "Is Hotaru with you?"
"No," Michiru said. "But Hotaru and Setsuna are meeting us at the 
moive theahter."
"You wanna hop in?" Haruka asked.
"We where going to the theahter to!" Minako said. "Lets go!"
All the girls hoped in and drove off. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Episode Two: Usagi
  One by one each girl walked out of the theater. All talking 
about their favorite parts. Usagi truned to Hotaru. "We are 
haveing a party for ChibiUsa. I was thinking you would be a 
suprise to her?"
Hotaru looked at Usagi. "I would be honered." 
Everyone pilled into Haruka's car. Usagi said she wanted to walk 
around for a while. As they puled out, it began to rain. 
Usagi got her umberala out and walked down to the grocery store. 
She bought things for the party. She then sat down and waited for 
a bus. When it came she truned around. 'That is funny, I thought a 
saw something.' she clibed on.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mamoru was siting down on the sofa reading a book. He saw Usagi 
walk in. "So how was the afternoon with the girls?"
Usagi took her coat off and hat. "Like when we where fourteen." 
she smiled and went in the kitchen. "Mamoru, how was work?"
He thought for a minute. "Oh, I got there and they did not need me 
so I went shopping for a gift for ChibiUsa."
"Did you find anything?" Usagi asked, while sticking her head out 
of the door.
"No," Mamoru said and the walked up stairs.
Usagi fallowed. "Mamo-chan, are you allright?" 
"I just have a headache." he shot back at her.
Usagi clibbed the stairs. The followed him in the room. "Why don't 
you get some sleep?" she asked. "I can always call someone to 
deliver something."
Mamoru was about to yell at her. He just wanted to be alone. He 
truned his head to do that but saw the look in her eyes. "I am not 
really hungery Usa." 
Usa, Usagi looked at him with more conceren. He never called her 
that unless something was wrong. She nodded and truned to leave 
but remembered something. "Mamoru," she began. "My cousin Tenchi 
is coming to the party."
Mamoru looked at her. "Isn't Tenchi that one guy with those three 
woman living with him?"
Usagi nodded. "Six. But now ther is only two, his wife and his 
wife's younger sister." she walked out and headded down stairs. 
Then flipped on the T.V. a report on the news channel was on.
"Some kind of deases has been striking men in the local area of 
Tokyo." the reporter said. "Jim, how dose this start?"
Luna walked up. "Usagi! Watching the news?"
"Shh!" Usagi said and ate some ice cream.
"Well it begins with a headache." Jim said. "then from there 
friends or family they seem to get really spacy. Then just stay 
away from everyone and fanilly need to go to the hospital."
Sirens filled the air. Usagi and Luna ran outside. They saw Rei 
get in a ambulence and drive off. Luna walked over to Artemis. 
"What is worng?"
"Something happened to Chad." Makoto said. "Rei said it stared all 
with a headache."
"Then he got spacy and wanted to flet alone." Minako added.
"He then even stayed away from Rei." Ami said.
"Then they go to the hospital." Usagi finished and looked down. 
Tears filled her eyes.
"Usako," Setsuna asked. "What is worng?"
"Mamoru may have that illness." Usagi cried.
"Maybe it is not an illness." Ami said. "I bet it is a sign of a 
new enemy. I mean it even happened to Greg,"
"Ken." Makoto said.
"Chad." Minako said.
"If it is an enemy." Usagi said. "We must make sure that Elios, 
when he comes, dose not even get it."
"All the pactiens." Ami said. "That I have talked to say that they 
touched a stone in a shop and it made them dissy."
"Lets talk over it with tea." Usagi said and invited them in her 
home. When they all got in a crash was heard up stairs. "What 
the....."
Luna ran down stairs. "Something is worng with Mamoru!" 
Usagi ran up stairs. She heard another crash. She walked up to the 
bedroom door and peeked in. "A yoma!" she called down stairs. she 
grabbed her locket. "ETERNAL MOON POWER, MAKE UP!"
Eternal Sailor Moon ran through the door. She saw a yoma holding 
Mamoru against the wall. "I am pretty soldier Sailor Moon! On 
behave of the Moon I shall punish you!"
"Really?" Kinute asked. "SNATCH!" she had cought sailor moon in a 
net with electical shocks in it. "AHHH!" sailor moon screamed.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Setsuna and Makoto told them they would do it. "JUPITER CRYSTAL 
POWER, MAKE UP!" "PLUTO CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!" 
Super Sailor Jupiter and Super Sailor Pluto ran up stairs. Hold 
it!" they yelled in allusion.
"What is this?" Kinute asked dropping Mamoru.
"I am the gaurdien of nature!" Super Sailor Jupiter said. "I am 
Super Sailor Jupiter!"
"I am Super Sailor Pluto gaurdien of time!" Super Pluto intorduced 
herself. "You shall not take this mans Dream Crystal, time shall 
tell!"
"Really?" Kinute asked. 
"JUPITER OAK......." "PLUTO......"
"Stop!" Kinute yelled. She healled a switch in her hand. "Or I'll 
kill Sailor Moon!"
Super Sailor Jupiter glanced over at Eternal Sailor Moon laying on 
the ground struggling for air. "If you let Mamoru and Eternal 
Sailor Moon go.... we will not attack."
Mamoru got up. He saw Eternal Sailor Moon laying on the ground. He 
winked at Pluto. She nodded.
"I do not bealve you Kinute." Pluto lied. "PLUTO DEAM SCREAM!"
Mamoru grabbed the switch and hit the release button. "You... 
won't...... kill...... her!"
Eternal Sailor Moon looked up. Mamoru yelling...... Pluto 
attacking...... Jupiter running to her. Her vision got blurry she 
then fell to the ground.
Jupiter pick her up and ran out of the room. "We need Uranus and 
Neptune!" 
"URANUS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!" "NEPTUNE CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
Uranus and Neptune ran to the room to see Kinute with Pluto's 
Tailsman. "Drop it!"
"You drop!" Kinute yelled.
Uranus and Neptune fell next to Pluto. Kinute walked up to Mamoru. 
Then put him agains the wall. "Now lets see the Dream 
Crystal....."
"PINK CRYSTAL ARROW SHOT!" a vocie attacked.
Kinute looked at the attack and was hit. "I'll be back!" then she 
dissapeared.
Mamoru looked at the figure. She was fimalier. The figure walked 
up and took the switch form him. "This way," she said. "No one 
will get hurt." then she walked away. 
Mamoru ran, or basicly fell most the way, to Usagi. He bent down. 
"Usako?"
Jupiter looked at him. "She was hurt very badly."
Uranus, Neptune and Pluto walked up and nelt down. "Most of her 
crystal energy was taken." Neptune said.
"Crystal Energy?" Mamoru asked.
"Yes." Pluto said. "Everyone one of us scouts have a crystal 
right?" they nodded. "Well when some of that is taken it can make 
you very weak." she paused. "If all of it is taken then you'll 
die." Pluto and all the other scouts got up and left.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A week passed and everthing was normal. Mamoru got no more 
headaches and very thing was perfect. 
Mamoru and Usagi walked through the mall and stopped by every 
store. Usagi, hopping that Mamoru would point something out that 
he would want while looking for something for ChibiUsa. "Mamoru," 
Usagi asked. "Take me to the place you found the statue."
They arived and Kyamin was at the counter. "Hello Mamoru!" she 
said happily. Then she saw Usagi. "Ohh... a... who is that?"
"This is Usagi." Mamoru said. "My wife."
Usagi bowed, as a sign as respect. "Mamo-chan says he saw 
something last week, is it still here?"
Kyamin pointed to the back of the store.
Usagi picked it up. The madian had a little symbole on it's head. 
"What is the symbol of?" she asked Mamoru.
"The symbol of love." Mamoru said. A pain in his head made him 
fall to the ground. 
"Mamoru, are you allright?" Usagi asked. She bent down and saw he 
was sweating and almost crying. Usagi wipped the tears of pain 
away from his cheaks. 'It is back..' Usagi thought. 'The 
headache.'
Mamoru looked at her. "Maybe.... we should go now." he said and 
held his head. Usagi helped him up and walked him out to the car. 
"I'll drive." Usagi started the engin and backed out.
Kyamin growled. "He was mine!"
"You are acting like your sister Ryoko!" a voice shot.
"Ryoko fell in love with the mortal she was supposed to kill." 
Kyamin shot back.
"You are supposed to kill the one with the Golden Crystal." the 
voice said.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Makoto looked out the door. She saw ChibiUsa coming out. "Everyone 
she is coming!"
Everyone hid. ChibiUsa walked in talking to some one. "Thanks for 
the ride Uncle Tenchi and Aunt Ayeka."
"Yes," Elios said. "Thanks." 
Tenchi looked at Ayeka. "Are you sure that devil woman did not 
follow you?" Ayeka asked.
"Well..." Tenchi said. "If I put her in a conatinment feild.. what 
do you think?" 
ChibiUsa walked around. "Where is everyone?"
"Looks like we cam to late for the party." Tenchi said.
"Ohhh I would not say that." Ryoko said. "Tenchi dear why did you 
come with Ayeka?" 
Ayeka shot a look at Tenchi. He was suprised as she was. 
"SUPRISE!" everyone called.
Usagi ran and hugged ChibiUsa. "Welcome home, ChibiUsa." Usagi 
noticed her cousin Tenchi. "Hello Tenchi and Ayeka."
"Hey what about me?" Ryoko asked.
"Who are you?" Usagi asked.
"This is Ryoko." Elios said.
Ryoko floated above everyone and looked in each window. She saw 
Mamoru in the bedroom in pain. "Hey, who is that hunky guy?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mamoru looked through the window and saw Ryoko. He stared at her. 
He also saw she was looking at him.
Ryoko got sick of waiting. She flew right through the window. 
"Helloo, I am Ryoko."
Mamoru stared at her. "R.... Ryoko?" he asked. He saw the 
exprision on her face.
"You know." Ryoko said. "You are cuter than Tenchi."
"Tenchi?" Mamoru asked. "As in Usagi's cousin?"
"The same." Ryoko said and dissapeared and reapeared above him. 
"Besides I can not marry Tenchi, but you..."
"Uh.." Mamoru said. "I am married allready."
"That is the trouble with this world!" Ryoko yelled. "All the cute 
guys are taken!" 
Tenchi and Usagi ran in. "Oh my god!" Usagi said. "She floats?"
"She is a demon." Tenchi said.
"A retried demon." Ryoko said.
"Still a demon!" Ayeka said.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Chapter Three: Tenchi
						Two weeks before
 
 Tenchi Masaki streched his arms out in the morning sun and 
yawned. It was not easy trying to keep six women from out space 
off of you each day. A demon, a princess with a younger sister, 
Two cops and scientest one. The he noticed Ayeka standing by the 
lake. "Lady Ayeka?"
Ayeka truned around. "Good morning Lord Tenchi," she smiled. "Not 
with your devil woman?"
"Uh..." Tenchi thought. "She is not mine." he knew he was lying. 
He had brought the 700 year hag back.
"Oh I see." Ayeka said. "So I have heard about your thing with 
your cousin."
"Oh," Tenchi said. "See my cousin's cousin got married and they 
are throwing a party for her," he looked back at the house. The 
wind blew in their hair.
"Tenchi." Ayeka said. "Do you fell it? Trouble."
Tenchi nodded. "It is coming from Tokyo." he looked down. "Usagi,"
"Who is this," Ayeka raised her voice. "Usagi, Tenchi Masaki?"
Tenchi looked to her. "My cousin. Something is worng, or is going 
to be wrong."
Ryoko appeared. "Tenchi? Do I need to start setting apointments 
just to see you?"
"AHH!" Tenchi screamed. "How it is you Ryoko."
"Who else?" Ryoko asked. "Mamoru?"
"You know about Usagi's husband?" Ayeka asked.
"Hunny!" Ryoko said. "I am a demon,"
"A real jerky demon." Ayeka said.
Tenchi left, when those to got in a fight nothing was going to 
stop them..... nothing. He walked in and saw Ayeka's little sister 
playing with Ri-Ryokoi. He smiled and went to his room. Last time 
he saw his cousin she was very sad. Like part of her died or 
something. He was going to stay with Usagi for a month and help 
her with her peoblems but Ryoko and Ayeka got in a fight about it. 
He told Usagi he would be back, but it was like she was in her own 
little sad world.
"LEAVE TENCHI ALONE!" Ayeka screamed at Ryoko. "I am married to 
him! Not you!"
"Really now?" Ryoko asked. "I thought that was a dream."
Ayeka left and slamed the door. Ryoko appeared in Tenchi's room. 
"Why did you marry her?" 
Tenchi truned to her. He knew Ryoko liked him, why else would a 
700 year old hag hang around? "Uh....." Tenchi thought. "Because 
we related by blood?"
"Wrong sweatums!" Ryoko said. "Because you wanted to make me-" she 
was cut off by Ayeka. 
Ayeka walked up to Tenchi. "Your cousins wants to talk to you," 
she bent down and kissed him. She left with a smile on her face.
"Uh..." Tenchi said. "I am like going now....." he ran down the 
stairs. And grabbed the phone. "Tenchi Masaki here."
"Hello Tenchi-chan." Usagi greeted him. 
"Hi Usagi-chan." he said. "So uh, what is up?"
"Well I was wondering did you uh..." she paused. "Have you had a 
wind that blows making it feal like trouble is near?"
"Yeah,"
"Well I think it is in Tokyo." she paused. "Come and check it out, 
Ami is already looking into it."
"I can not unless I have a good reason." Tenchi said. "Ayeka would 
go nuts."
"Tell her that you are leaving early for the party." Usagi said. 
"Or you are going to pick up ChibiUsa."
"I'll get back to you on that." Tenchi hung up spun around. Ayeka 
was talking to her sister and Ryoko saying that was not ture. He 
sighed. 'I just want one day!' 
"TENCHI!" all the girls yelled. Each grabbing him.
"Hey let go!" Tenchi yelled. "What am I a tug-a-war tope?!"
"Tenchi dear." Ryoko asked. "What is tug-a-war?"
"What you where doing to me but with a rope." Tenchi said. "I am 
going to go pack." He left and ran into his grandpa. "So Tenchi? 
Why are you packing?" "I am going to vist Usagi Tsukino."
"Your lovley cousin?" His grandpa asked.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Ayeka put her ear to the door, the Ryoko jupmed on her followed by 
her little sister. "So Ayeka...." Ryoko asked "What is up?"
"Tenchi in visting a lovley girl!" Ayeka yelled. "I can not I 
married him!"
"It is his cousin." Sasami said. "Besides I am going with him."
"WHAT?" Ryoko and Ayeka yelled.
"Me and Tenchi are going." Sasami repeated.
"Well then," Ayeka said. "I must go too. I have to waych over 
you."
"Akeya!" Sasami said. "I can watch over myself!" 
"Yeah." Ryoko agreed. "She is fifteen." Ryoko then dissapread and 
reapred infornt of Tenchi and his grandpa. She pretned to cry. "So 
what is this I hear about you and a lovley girl?"
"Uh...." Tenchi began. "What is so funny?"
Ryoko pointed to the door and whispered. "Ayeka thinks you are 
going to see a lovely woman, be sides her." she laughed and 
flaoted above Tenchi. "Aww, princess you can not hide it! Even 
Sasami heard!"
Ayeka opened the door. "Devil woman," she said to Ryoko. "Always 
butting in! I should have banished you from the house when I 
married Tenchi!"
Ryoko looked at Aykea. This time she really did cry. "So? You made 
me leave the wedding just because you though if I told Tenchi how 
I loved him we would love you instead?" she paused at got Re-
Ryoki. "Well I guess we will leave then." she dissapeared.
"RYOKO!" Sasami cried but now one answered. "Great going sister! 
Now I have not one to talk to!" she ran out the door and slammed 
it. 
Tenchi eyed Ayeka. "Is that why Ryoko was not at the wedding? You 
fearded that I would love her not you?" He looked at her. Then 
followed Sasami, she was running up the montain. "Hey! Sasami 
wait!"
Sasami looked down. "Hurry up!" she called. She then reached a 
cave. "Tenchi?"
Tenchi had finally cought up. "W..What?" he asked while catching 
his breath. "Oh. That is Ryoko's cave. Lets see if she is in 
there." 
They both clibbed in. Sobbs came from the bottom of the cave. 
"Ryoko?" the called. No one answered. They then went down, well 
slid down the rest of the way.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A week pased and no one saw Ryoko. Ayeka walked up to Tenchi while 
they where getting in the car. "So I guess Ryoko went back to 
sleep hu?"
Tenchi started the car, not answereing, either did Sasami. They 
drove off.
Ryoko appeared in the sky above them. Tears ran down her cheeks. 
The wind blew and they followed the car and hit Ayeka in the face. 
"Tears?" she asked and looked out the window. She saw Ryoko and 
gasped. She truned her head to Tenchi. "Tenchi! Ryoko is crying!"
Tenchi looked out the window. He saw Ryoko, he almost called to 
her but she dissapeared. He looked back to the road and drove down 
to Tokyo. 
Ryoko appeared on top of the car and sat down. "Well Re-Ryoki 
looks like we are going to Tokyo!"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
      Chapter Four: Tenchi
					At the Party

"Still a demon!" Ayeka yelled.
Tenchi and Usagi tradded glances. Usagi nodded. Tenchi walked up 
to Ryoko and grabbed her hand and walked off. 
Usagi ran to Mamoru. "Are you fealing good enough to see 
ChibiUsa?" 
Mamoru nodded. Still his headache rang in his ears. He saw 
ChibiUsa walk in. He looked at her, then noticed she was infornt 
of a mirror. "ChibiUsa can you move?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tenchi looked at Ryoko. "I am glad you came Ryoko."
Ryoko looked at him. Tears filled her eyes. "Really? I thought you 
loved Ayeka." she paused. 'I have waited two full years to tell 
him, better do it now.' "Tenchi, ever since I meet you I thought 
you where kind."
Tenchi looked at her. "Uh...hu?"
"And... and." she paused again. "When Kagato killed you I thought 
my life was going to end." she looked down. "I guess what I am 
trying to say is that..., Tenchi Masaki I love you."
Tenchi stared at her, tears running down her cheeks. 'She must 
have missed me.' "I..." he was cut off by Ayeka.
"Tenchi Masaki!" Ayeka ran up to him. "She is tricking you! She is 
only saying that to get the jewel!"
Ryoko looked at her. "I can get it anyway." she said. "Once a 
demon tells the guy she loves she dose love him she becomes 
mortal, and hopeing that her would marry her."
"Well it can not happen!" Ayeka yelled, then saw her crying. 
"You... you do love him, don't you?" She flet trebibal. "I am 
sorry Ryoko, I did not mean too..."
Ryoko raised up in the air, "Don't wroy about it." she looked down 
at Tenchi. "I mean he loves you and you love him." with a flash 
she was gone.
Ayeka looked at Tenchi his head down and tears forming. "You.... 
you love her two," she paused. "You love Ryoko!"
Tenchi looked away. "Ayeka, you can be very sellfish sometimes."
Ayeka backed away. "You never told me that you loved her...."
"I guess I just found out." Tenchi said and walked dwon stairs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sasami saw Ryoko on the roof, she clibed the fire escape. "Ryoko, 
did you tell Tenchi?"
She nodded. "Now I whish I did not," she paused. "You see once a 
person like me admitts her love she becomes mortal, and the man 
supposed to marry her, but Tenchi is married to Ayeka,"
Sasami put her hand on Ryoko's shoulder. "I would love to have a 
sister like you, and not Ayeka," she paused and heard someone come 
up the stairs. "Hello Setsuna!" she said.
Setsuna sat down next Ryoko. "Ryoko-chan," she said. "You will 
find a guy you like." she paused. "You have now he just needs to 
love you back."
Tenchi came up and the roof. Setsuna looked to Sasami and they 
left. Setsune put her hand on his shoulder and whispered in his 
year. "She loves you. Maybe you should love her?"
Ryoko took her gem off her wrist. She truned to Tenchi and looked 
at his sword. "Can... can I see it?"
Tenchi handed it over and watched Ryoko put her gem in it. "Uh.. 
Ryoko wait... I" he was cut off once again, but by Ryoko. "Call it 
my wedding gift." she then jumped of the roof and landed prefectly 
on her feat. She then walked up to the forest and hopped in a 
tree, 'I think this is a good place.'
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<Have you told her?> a voice asked Tenchi. Tenchi spun around and 
saw Usagi, they could talk tellapathicaly. He truned his head 
away. <I guess you haven't uh?> Usagi walked up and put her hadn 
on his shoulder. <Tenchi, why not?>
"Because everytime I came close I got interputed." Tenchi said and 
walked away. He then clibbed down the stairs and went to his and 
Ayeka's room.
Usagi sat down and looked at the full moon. 'Mamo-chan, please be 
allright.' she thought adn then left too.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko was looking at the moon, that night. 'Well,' she thought. 'I 
better call home and go back I mean there is no reason to stay.' 
she whistled at Re-ohki came running up. "Come on Re-ohki lets go 
home." she then opened a portal. 'Home.... to Washu.' she thought. 
She put one foot in and looked back. She saw Tenchi running around 
for someone, or something. She sighed and stepped in. A white 
light filled the forest catching Tenchi's attion. He looked over 
to the driection of the light the sword recated. "What the?" he 
asked and three jewels glew then died out. 
Tenchi ran to the forest looking around her exsamed each branch. 
He then found one that was almost bent. He climbed on it and 
looked up. The sorce of the light was dissapearing. "Ryoko!" he 
called.
Re-ohki jumped out and landed on Tenchi making him lose his 
balance and falling! He hit the ground hard and hurt his head. 
"Ow..." he rubbed his head. "Re-ohki? Where is Ryoko?"
Re-ohki pointed with her ear to where the portal was. The sword 
stood up and truned into a projecting images. Washu stood there, 
"Hello Tenchi Masaki." she said. "I have a question for you."
"What?" Tenchi asked. He sometimes trust Washu because she got to 
involded with her invetions. Although one of them help save his 
mother. 
Washu looked do at Re-ohki. "Well I have Ryoko here but not Re-
hoki." she paused and looked to Tenchi. "Got any idea why Ryoko is 
so bumped? I took a sapmle of her powers and she had none! Not 
even a jewel!"
Tenchi pointed down at the sword and Washu nodded. "She gave you 
all her power? Why?" she hit herself in the head. "That is why! 
She loves you!"
'How long dose it take to figure that out?' Tenchi thought.
"Tenchi....." a voice called out. "Tenchi...."
He shock his head. "I gotta go now, um why don't you some to my 
cousin's house? I am staying with her." she paused at waited. 
"Allright." Washu said. "I'll be ther by four o'clock, should I 
bring Ryoko?"
"Uh...." Tenchi thought. "No,"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tenchi walked inside to see Usagi on the floor reading. "What is 
worng?" he asked and sat next to her. 
Usagi looked up. Her eyes filled with supriseness. "I... I though 
you where asleep." she looked up the stairs. "Something is worng 
with Mamoru, we won't even go near ChibiUsa."
Tenchi thought for a minute. "Look, if you are worried why don't 
you go up stairs and talk to him?"
Usagi nodded, then got up and walked up stairs. She walked in and 
closed the door.
Tenchi walked up to his and Ayeka's room and closed the door. 
Ayeka was reading. She looked up. "I am sorry Tenchi.... I did not 
mean to make her leave." Tenchi shock his head. "I think it was 
me, I just do not know."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

	Chapter Five:  Ryoko 

  Ryoko lied on her bed and closed her eyes. Memerios ran 
through her head. She shock her head. 'I need to start 
over.' She sat up and flaoted above her bed. Washu walked 
in. "I see that you still uh.... flaot." she smiled. "I just 
got done talking to Tenchi." she paused. "I am visting him 
tomorrow, I asked if I should bring you, but he shook his 
head and said no."
"He dose not want me intreffering with him and Ayeka." Ryoko 
said while looking out her window into space. "I am home, my 
real home, that is all that counts."
Washu touched her hand. "Home is where your heart is Ryoko. 
That is where you belong, where your heart is, and that is 
with Tenchi."
"Was," Ryoko said. She then flaoted out her window and 
walked around. There 'house' was located near Jupiter so 
they could see the solar system. She looked at Earth. She 
formed a ball of energy in her plam. She whished she could 
just get red of it but then lots of inasent people would die 
and she sould not do that. She sighed and blew up a comet 
head toward the moon. She flaoted over to asteroid and 
looked at the moon. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Washu sat at her desk looking for a piece of papper. "Urgg! 
Where is that stupid piece of papper!!!"
Ryoko walked in and looked at Washu. "Washu...." she began 
but she knew Washu liked Ryoko calling her mom. "I mean 
mom."
Washu looked up. "What is it?" she looked closely to Ryoko. 
"Oh, it is about Tenchi-sama isn't it?"
"N..no!" Ryoko lied. "I just wanted to know what you where 
doing."
"Ah ah!" Washu cried with joy. "I found Kymin's desgins!"
"K... Kymin?" Ryoko asked.
"Oh..." Washu looked over at Ryoko. "Kymin was your sister I 
made a year before you where born," she paused. "I sent her 
to earth."
Earth....., the planet with white clouds and blue water. 
'Tenchi....' Ryoko thought. She flaoted above Washu and 
dissaperead. She then reapeared an top of a shop that Usagi 
and Tenchi where going into.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Usagi walked up to Kiyman. "Hello Kyiman," she greeted. 
"This is my cousin, Tenchi Masaki." 
Kyiman looked at him. "You are the cutest guy yet to come." 
she said. She then cought Ryoko out of the corner of her 
eye. "And is this you friend?" she pointed to Ryoko.
Ryoko blushed. She then tellaported behind Tenchi. 
Tenchi looked out, "I don't see anyone." she felt someone 
behind him. A sweat drop formed on his head. 'Ohhh ok,' he 
looked around but no one was there. He saw Ryoko giggling 
behind him. He spun around to cath Ryoko. But Ryoko was 
dress differently. She had on more of a girl outfit then a 
space pirate outfit. He blushed and looked around.
Ryoko looked at him. She blushed knowing it was the outfit. 
She then roase above him and looked down. She blushed and 
also truned away. She then left to the back of the store. 
She picked up the statue. 'What a piece of junk!' she 
thought then threw it and in broke against the wall. A 
little gem came out and a light beam was aming at Ryoko. She 
gasped and saw it was aming for Tenchi! "TENCHI WATCH IT!"
Tenchi spun around and drew his sword. He reflected it and 
it hit the nerby wall. Then put his sword away and walked up 
to the gem. And then stepped on it making it brake. He 
glared at Ryoko who was blushing and truned her head, she 
didn't want to see Tenchi upset. Something caught her eye. 
Tenchi's eyes where different, filled with hate and madness. 
"Tenchi..." she began. "Are.... are you allright?"
Tenchi glared at her. "Don't you Tenchi me," he paused. 
"Space Demon." He then drew his sword out and held the blade 
to Ryoko's neck. 
"MOON ETERNAL POWER, MAKE UP!" Usagi called truning into 
Eternal Sailor Moon. "I am the champion of love and justice! 
The pretty soldier Eternal Sailor Moon!" she then held her 
arm out. 'That is right!' she thought. 'My staff was 
distroyed by Galaxia!' Sailor Moon saw Tenchi turn his head 
toward. "Uh oh!" she ran around and freaked out. She then 
became air born, 'I never knew I could fly!' she then picked 
up Ryoko and they flew out.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko woke up in Eternal Sailor Moon's arms. She put her 
hand on her head. "Oww." she said and looked around where. 
"Whe... Where is Tenchi?!" she asked and stood up. "TENCHI!" 
she called but Sailor Moon helled her back. "Look! He was 
being controled by someone!" Eternal Sailor Moon saw Ryoko 
look in her eyes. "So?" Ryoko asked. "Ryoko-san!!!" Eternal 
Sailor Moon yelled. "Tenchi almost killed you!!!!" 
Ryoko freed herself from Eternal Sailor Moon's grasp. 
"Usagi-chan! Tenchi would never try to kill me!" she looked 
at her friend. Eternal Sailor Moon took Ryoko's hand and 
then a pink light form making a new locket and a new staff. 
Usagi looked to the locket and to Ryoko. "Did you..."
Ryoko nodded. "It is the only way to bring Mamoru-sama 
back," she paused. "The only way to bring Tenchi-sama back." 
Ryoko grabbed Usagi's hand tellaported herself and Usagi to 
her mother's labartory. "Mother!"
Washu run in, "What?" she looked at Ryoko. Ryoko grabbed her 
mother's shoulders. "You can not go to Tenchi-sama's house!" 
"Why not?"
Usagi put her hand on Washu's shoulder. "Tenchi-sama is 
being controlled by someone. He almost killed Ryoko!"
Washu thought. "It must be Kymin," she paused. "I gave her 
the power to control her enemys. Some how she has made it so 
she can controll anyone,"
Usagi shock her head. "No," she said. "She can only control 
males." Washu nodded. "We must bring Tenchi-sama back!"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko grabbed Sasami's and Ayeka's hands. "Look! Tenchi is 
possed! Ok? We have to get you outta here before he comes!"
Ayeka pulled her hand back. "Your nutes." 
Tenchi then walked into the room. His eyes normal. He looked 
at everyone then went back Ryoko. "Your back?"
Ryoko blinked. "I meet you in the shop today remeber?" she 
knew Tenchi had his memroris whiped out. She then grabbed 
Ayeka's hand tighter and flaoted up. "WEE!" Sasami said 
happily.  Ryoko then tellaported out side. "Now...." she 
looked at Ayeka. "Allow me to explain?"
Tenchi ran out with his sword drawn out. "Let Ayeka go you 
Space Demon!" 
Ayeka stared at Ryoko. "You are telling the truth." she 
looked down at Tenchi. "Excuse me sir, are you really Tenchi 
Masaki?" Tenchi glared at her. "What do you think?" "Well," 
Ayeka said. "My Tenchi would never have called Ryoko a Space 
Demon." Ryoko glared at her. "YOUR Tenchi?!"
Tenchi jumped up and chopped the hand that held Ayeka off. 
He then caught Ayeka. "LET ME GO!" Ayeka yelled. Ryoko's 
hand grew back. She grabbed the Gem away from Tenchi. "That 
IS mine." she said. 
"WORLD SHAKING!" Uranus attacked making Tenchi falled dwon 
dropping Ayeka. Uranus walked up to Ayeka and helped her up.
Ryoko appeared infornt of Uranus. "LOOK! IF YOU HARM TENCHI 
I SHALL KILL YOU!!!!!!!" Uranus moved her hand off. "Look, I 
am helping him see?" she pointed to Tenchi geting up and 
holding his arm. "Uh..... I guess not." 
Usagi ran out. "AURA-STAR MOON POWER, MAKE UP!" she 
transformed into a new sailor form. "I am the soldier of 
love and justice! The pretty soldier Sailor Cosmic Moon!"
Tenchi smriked. He jumped at her ready to attacks. Star Moon 
held her staff out. "MOON ELCIPSED HEALING!" a light shot at 
Tenchi and knocked him down. Ayeka ran to him. "Tenchi?" she 
asked. "Tenchi? GOSH DANG IT TENCHI WAKE UP!"
Tenchi awoke and looked around, he stood up and saw Ryoko. 
She still had Sasami. Ryoko dropped Sasami in the pool. 
"Heheh!" Sasami said. "That was fun!"  
Ryoko then walked over to Sailor Cosmic Moon. "Thanks," she 
said then gave the soldier her last gem, "It will give you 
more power."
Washu appeared. "Looks like I came in time!" she then looked 
at Ryoko. "I found out how Kymin uses her powers to affect 
men." 
"Tenchi..." the same voice told him. "Distory Ryoko! She is 
trying to take you away from Ayeka! Get red of her!"
Tenchi stood up and pointed his sword to Ryoko's face. 
"Leave Ayeka alone Space Demon."
Ryoko looked at him. His eyes red again. She then drew her 
sword too. "I can not kill you Tenchi," she said. "Plus I am 
not doing nothing to Ayeka," Ryoko drew her sword up and 
chopped Tenchi's in hafe. "Now stop it Tenchi-sama." A voice 
whispered in Ryoko's year. "Stop him! Before he kills your 
friends and famaily!" Ryoko shock her head. "Tenchi stop 
this!" Ryoko's oufit changed into the one she had while 
battling Kakoto. Her eyes Amber and green she choked Tenchi. 
"Tenchi stop this now!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Chapter Six: Tenchi


"Tenchi stop this now!" Ryoko yelled while choking him.
Tenchi tried to get out of the monsters infulance but could 
not. He drew his sword out and cut her hand off. He glared 
at her. "Why should I? You'll just take Ayeka away! Making 
me think to love you!" He put his sword up to her face and 
took the jewel away that was on her right wrist. 
Ryoko then fell to the ground. She was weak and tired she 
flaoted up and dissapered.
Tenchi brought his sword back and saw Ayeka running to him. 
"Tenchi-sama, why did you do that?" her eyes filled with 
tears.
Tenchi looked at her, the monster falling asleep inside him. 
He looked at where Ryoko was. "What happened?" he asked then 
saw is sword. He made the blade come out, it was a differnet 
color. Now red. He gasped and droped. 'Is the red blood.... 
or darkness?' he ran to the house and slammed the door. He 
ran up to his bedroom and held his head.
"Good Job Tenchi," the voice said. "You have killed Ryoko."
'What!?' Tenchi asked himself. 'I did not!'
Ryoko appeared infornt of him, her outfit back to it's 
normal form, same with her eyes. She fell in his arms. She 
looked at Tenchi. "Ten.....chi?" she asked, to weak to even 
finish a word. She then grabbed her sword and handed it to 
Tenchi. "Use it to kill Kymin." she asked then fell to the 
ground. 
"W... Who is Kymin?!" Tenchi asked picking her up. Washu 
then walked in. "Kymin is Ryoko's older sister, I gave her 
the power to contorl her enemys but know she is controlling 
men allover Japan." she paused. "She tried to get you to 
kill Ryoko that way you could kill Akeya."
"But why?" Tenchi asked still holding on to Ryoko. He looked 
down to her, she had fainted or died he could not tell which 
it was. 
Washu walked up to Ryoko. "She wants you to herself, not 
have anyone in the way. She was controlling Ryoko to."
Tenchi had a new question to ask washu. "If she wanted me 
then why did she try to get Ryoko to kill me? Better yet why 
was Ryoko able to controll the monster better then me?"
Washu smiled. "Ryoko has had someone control her allready, 
she has learned to make it do what she wants." a streak of 
worryness crossed Washu's face. "Ryoko!" she called to her 
daughter.
Tenchi stared at her. "What is wrong?" he looked down at 
Ryoko, she was dieing! "We have to save her!!"
A woman appeared infornt of them. "Well mother seems this 
guy is more harder to get a hold of then Mamoru." she 
smiled.
"Kymin!" she hissed.
"Really mother!" Kymin said and then looked at Tenchi. "It 
is if you hate me!" she then took Tenchi's head and drew it 
closer to her.
Then Sailor Cosmic Moon ran in. "Stop!"
Kymin smilled and rised in the air. "Come on Tenchi! Go and 
distory her!"
Tenchi felt the moster take over him again. He treid to 
fight it but he could not. He reached for his sword and it 
came to him. He then dropped Ryoko on the ground.
Ryoko woke up. "Tenchi!!!" she said while crying. She then 
saw a red rose sratch Tenchi in the face making him fall 
back into her arms. "Tenchi?" she asked while crying on his 
head. She looked at the rose and saw a man in a tuxedo threw 
it. "You..... You killed him!" she got up and drew her sword 
and attacked Tuxedo Mask, tears running down her face.
Kymin froze Ryoko. "Now I think we need to fight some where 
else!" 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko resumed her possion on a spaceship. She then stopped 
and saw Tenchi standing next to Kymin. She walked up to him 
and took his hand. "Ten.." she could not finish because 
Tenchi slaped her into a wall. She looked into his eyes, 
cold, dark and evil, yet showing a glips of pledding. She 
put her Sword back which suprised him. She walked up and 
kissed him on the lips.
Tenchi took this be complete suprise. He pulled away from 
her. He looked at the girl, who was dying. He then looked at 
Kymin. "She is dying," he said taking over the monster. 
"Should we heal her then conitue? I whish to fight a healthy 
person."
Kymin thought. "Why not? It is better then whatching her 
suffer."
Ryoko could not beleave what she was hearing, she stepped 
back and ran but Tenchi grabbed her hand. "LET GO OF ME!" 
she twisted her arm until it was free but then ran into two 
robots and they caried her away. "STOP IT LET ME GO!!!!! 
TENCHI STOP!"
-----------------------------------------------------------
Tenchi watch her be put in a little machince that filled 
with water. They hooked up a breathing mask and walked away. 
He looked at Ryoko the monster had taken over him again. He 
laughed and walked away. "Tenchi." Ryoko looked at him. He 
spun around not knowing what was next. "Please Tenchi come 
back! Get me outta here!"
He looked at her and walked over. He was taking over his own 
body again and put his hand on the glass part. 
Ryoko had been put to sleep until she was fully healed.
Tenchi walked out and saw Sailor Cosmic Moon being caried 
away and being put in a cage. 
Kymin flaoted over to Tenchi. "Why don't you go to sleep? 
Tomorrow you can fight Ryoko."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
			Chapter Seven: Tenchi

 
 That night Tenchi could not sleep. He then reached in his 
coat and grabbed out a transmitter. He sent a message to 
Washu and the others. 
Someone was fighting their pillow in their sleep he got up 
and saw Usagi had haved her locket taken away. <Are you 
alright Usagi-san?> he asked tellapathicaly. Usagi looked up 
and smiled. <Depenes of your defention of 'alright'> she 
said. <If you mean it as in I am alive yeah, if you meant it 
as like I am not hurt, no> they both heard footsteps. A 
guard walked in. She took Tenchi's transmitter. "Hey the is 
mine!" Tenchi yelled at her. 
The guard looked at him, "Lady Kymin whishes no 
transmistions." she said. <I little late.> Usagi told 
Tenchi. <Yeah,> he agreeded. He lookd at the guard. "How is 
Lady Ryoko?" he asked. <I would not call her a lady,> Usagi 
told him. <Ethier is 'Lady' Kymin>
The gaurd walked out. "I can not say that! It is classafied 
information." she walked out.
<That means she is doing fine!> Usagi said. "Hey wait! What 
about Mamoru?"
"The same." the gaurd said.
Usagi looked down realizing he was just like Tenchi, she 
would have to fight him. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Washu called everyone. "Look a transmision from Tenchi!"
Makoto looked up from her soup. "Lets go and kick Miss Space 
Demon's butt!" Sasami looked at her. "You mean Ryoko?" 
"Uh.... well uh."
"She ment Kymin." Setsuna said. "Lets transform! That way we 
can go prepeared!" she healled her stick out, "PLUTO CRYSTAL

"MERCURY CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!" "MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE

MAKE UP!"
"COSMIC MOON POWER, MAKE UP!"
Five other scouts joined the line. Sasami got up. "I am 
going with you, Tsunami can help you. You need her." 
Ayeka and Washu looked up. "You can not!" Ayeka protested. 
"Tsunami is to powerful for you!" Washu looked at her 
research. "She needs to learn how to control it," she said. 
"Besides are you going? Tenchi-sama needs use!"
Ryo-ohki got up and transformed into the spaceship. 
Everyone, inculding Washu borded. "Come on Ayeka!" Sasami 
said. 
Ayeka looked down. "No, I can not handle the sword of 
Juria."
Jupiter looked over to Mars and winked. Mars smiled. "You 
know Ryoko would have called you a chicken, infact I bet she 
is saying it!"
Ayeka got on. "I'll show you!" she stromed on and sat down. 
Mercury eyed them. Jupiter went away soon followed by Mars.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The gaurd walked in the next morning, waking Tenchi and 
Usagi up. "Time to eat breakfest."
Usagi glanced over to Tenchi. <She is actually giving us 
breakfast? This is very scary.>
Tenchi agreed but he got up and followed the guared, <Come 
on Usagi, you can ask 'Lady' Kymin if Mamoru is alright>
They entered seeing that everything was ready to eat. They 
where stunned. Kymin floated over to Tenchi. "I heard that 
you where wondering how Ryoko was doing." she smiled. "Well 
I though I would bring her in, she needs her strenght,"
"Wait!" Usagi yelled. "What about Mamoru?"
Kymin looked at her. "You'll see him soon." she snapped her 
fingers and two robots brought Ryoko in.
Tenchi looked at her. "She looks dead! Not healthy!" Ryoko 
looked at him but then the robots hit her in the head. 
"Oww!" she cried in pain. The robots pushed her down infornt 
of Tenchi and Kymin. She looked at saw Kymin kissing him. 
"LEAVE TENCHI ALONE! YOU PIG!" she fought herself free and 
ran out of the room and into the spaceshuttle's ships. 
'Maybe if I get on one I can tell them!' she then saw Ryo-
ohki bording. 
All the sailor scouts came out. "Man..." Venus said. "That 
little cabbit goes fast!" they saw Ryoko. Ayeka walked up to 
Ryoko. "Where.....where is Tenchi?" Ryoko pointed to the 
room she came from. "It is guarded though."
Uranus nodded to Pluto and Neptune. "WORLD..." "DEEP...." 
"DEAD....." the began there attacks. "SHAKING!" "SUBMERG!" 
"SCREAM!" all three attacks broke the door.
"Who are you?!" Kymin shot.
"Lured by the new epic, I am Sailor Uranus!"
"Lured be the new epic, I am Sailor Neptune!"
"I am Sailor Pluto, guradien of time! You shall not destory

"I am Sailor Venus! Scout of Love!"
"I am Sailor Mars! Scout of War!"
"I am Sailor Mercury! Scout of Ice!"
"And I am, Sailor Cosmic Moon! An on behave of theI shall

Ayeka, Washu and Sasami took their places with the sailor 
soldiers. "Let Tenchi go!" Ayeka yelled. She then 
transformed into her Juria battle suit. Washu looked around. 
"Sucky equiment Kymin." Sasami brought forth Tsunami. 
Ryoko then truned into her battle suit. She tapped Ayeka on 
the shoulder. "We may have to fight Tenchi." Ayeka nodded. 
"Did you call me a chicken?" Ryoko sook her head.
Kymin got up. "OK Tenchi, and Mamoru attack!"
Tenchi and Mamoru got up and drew their swords. They both 
head toward their emenys.
"LIQUID HARMONY!" Mercury attack making Mamoru pause and 
shake it off. "MARS... FLAME SNIPPER!" a arrow of flames 
headed twoard Tenchi, but he dodge it. Jupiter spun around 
and lighting sruonned her. "JUPITER OAK EVOULTION!" this 
time it hit both of them. "VENUS LOVE AND BEAUTY SHOCK!" the 
attack suronned them and captured them.
Ryoko then flaoted above them and spun around. Lighting 
suronded them and shocked them. "Stop it Ryoko!" Ayeka 
creid. "You are hurting them." "No just the evil forces in 
them." she contiuded and nodded to Saturn and Cosmic Moon. 
"MOON ARROW LOVE SHOT!" "SATURN GLAIVE BLAST!" Venus's chain 
dissaperd leaving the two men able for attacking. The 
attacks hit them and they fell to the ground. "Tenchi!" 
Ayeka ran to him. "Are you allright?" Usagi ran to Mamoru. 
"Youre ok?"
Ryoko then went to her sister. "Let us battle. One on One no 
cheeting, energy only."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chapter Eight: Ryoko

 
"Let us battle. One on One no cheeting, energy only." Ryoko 
told her sister. "You up to it?"
Kymin thought. "Winner gets Tenchi and loser..." she paused 
and smiled. "Gets to battle with him, If I where to win 
between you and me you get to battle Tenchi, and if you lose 
that I guess you die,"
"And what if you lose?" Ryoko growled. 
"Who said I was?" Kymin said. "Ohh... I see then you get 
Tenchi and I have to fight him, I am up to it, you?"
Ryoko looked to Tenchi. 'Winner gets all...' she thought. 
'Including Tenchi.' she then grabbed her sword. "You bet. 
Since this place in already blown up lets fight outside. In 
space."
"NO," Kymin said. She pointed to the room everyone was in. 
"There is a battle room in there, lets go."
They entered with everyone wide eyed, Each girl grabbed 
their swords and slashed.
Ryoko attacked first, she missed! The Kymin, she missed too! 
Both where poreing their soles out to claim their love for 
Tenchi. Ryoko looked over to Tenchi. 'If I do die he will 
have Ayeka.' "AHHHH HAA!" Kymin said. "I found your 
weakness." she snapped her fingers and the robots picked up 
Tenchi, who was still knocked out. Ryoko glared "Let him 
go!!!!" she attacked with rage and cut her sisters arm off.
"Please sister!" Kymin took over her sister's body. Ryoko's 
sword coming closer and closer to her neck. She closed her 
eyes. 'This is how it ends....' she thought. 
A blue flash appeared. Ryoko opened her eyes. Tenchi, had 
transformed into his Juria form and held his sword up. 
"Tenchi! You'll die let me fight!" Tenchi looked at her. "I 
can not let you die," he said and walked over to Ryoko and 
helped her stand up. Kymin laughed. "So Tenchi Masaki? You 
have a soft spot for her no? You love her just the way she 
loves you." Tenchi glared at her. "I do not lover her, she 
is my friend, that is all."
Ryoko balanced herself and stared into Tenchi's eyes. "So I 
told you that for nothing uh?" she truned to Kymin and cut 
her other hand off then missed her stomach. Kymin laughed. 
She then through Ryoko into a wall which knocked her out.
Everyone gasped. Ayeka ran to Tenchi. "Aren't you going to 
help her? I thought you loved her!" Tenchi looked away. "I 
did, until you came and showed me the truth." Ayeka slapped 
him. "Snap out of it TENCHI-SAMA!" she yelled. "You told me 
you loved her, she is over there holding on to her life and 
you are saying that you do not care?!?!" 
"That is right!" Kymin said. "I actully told him that she 
was going to kill you then everyone else."
Pluto looked at her staff, and saw the future. "She dose not 
you evil hag! She ends up-" she cut herself off knowing that 
she could not tell the future to them. "She dose not."
Tenchi looked into Pluto's eyes. "She dose not?" he had been 
tricked! He then grabbed his sword and cut right into 
Kymin's stomache. "Really is that the best you can do?"

Chapter Nine: Usagi

"No!" Usagi walked up. "I shall not let you kill my friends 
and family!" she truned into her princess form and healed 
the crystal up high. "Planet Power!" 
"MERCURY CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"JUPITER CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"VENUS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"NEPTUNE CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"UEANUS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
"PLUTO CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!"
Satuen glanced up. She held her silcene glaive up. 
"Death...." she healed it up higher. "reborn...." she 
brought it down fast and faster. "Evoultion!" a purple light 
filled the room and the ship began a countdown. "10 seconds 
until selfdesterction."
Everyone ran out and only Tenchi, Serenity and Satrun 
remained. <Tenchi,> Serenity said. <Escape now!> he ran up 
and grabbed Ryoko. "What about Satrun?" Sernity actully 
yelled at him. <Just go!> 
Serenity healled the crystal abover her and twriled around. 
Making a silver light, awaking Ryoko she jumped out of 
Tenchi's arms and ran toward it. But the light blasted her 
back making her blast into a wall. Tenchi picked her up once 
again and ran to Ryo-ohki. Once they bored Ryoko went to the 
front of the ship and helped her mom drive it.
Ayeka ran into Tenchi's arms. "I thought you would have died 
Tenchi-sama." she looked around. "Where is Usagi and Sailor 
Saturn?" he pointed to the ship. Everyone gathered around 
the window. Serenity tellaported herself behind them carying 
a small baby. Ryoko walked up to Serenity. "Where is Saturn-
san?" she asked and saw Serenity pointing down to the baby. 
Ryoko smilled. "She is soo cute!" Serenity handed the baby 
to Ryoko. "Would you like to raise her?"
Ryoko grew pale. "Well.... uh... gee I... uh.. don't 
know..." she looked over to Tenchi. "Only if Tenchi helps 
me."
Tenchi spun around since his voice was said. "What?!" he 
asked. Ryoko giggled and Serenity truned back to Usagi and 
walked over to Tenchi. "I asked her if she would take care 
of and raise Hotaru or Saturn," she told him. <But she said 
only if you helped her.>
Tenchi blushed. "Wel... uh.... uh...." he looked over to 
Ayeka. "This is your choice not mine, if you chose to help 
Ryoko that is fine, I need to return home and tell them I am 
allright, I won't have time to raise a child."
Ryoko cuddled to child. "What a cute little child!" she 
looked over to Tenchi. "So.....?"
Everyone waited egeraly to here his answer, even Washu. 
Washu looked over to Ryoko. "Well if Tenchi where to stay 
with Ryoko I have no problem with it!" all the scouts 
agreed. 
Pluto looked at her staff. 'Now if only they would be 
toghter, then the future is true.' she looked up. "I am 
sorry Tenchi-sama I can not tell you what you chose."
Tenchi thought. If he went with Ayeka then he would have to 
formal and have people expect things out of him that he 
could not do, but if he went with Ryoko then he would have 
to take of the shrine and make sure she and Hotaru where 
allright, if he went with Ayeka his life would be long and 
rich, if he went to Ryoko then his life would be full of 
danger and probley short.
Pluto knew what we would chose. He would chose Ayeka, but 
then with time you could never tell. That is why she did not 
tell him, for if she did then Ayeka would know and be happy 
when Ryoko would be said, on the other hand if she told them 
and he chose Ryoko then Ayeka would be heart broken, she 
could not when either way.
Ryoko sat down. "Let us give him a night." she gave the baby 
some milk. 
Ayeka stopped her foot. "How about we do it now? I have to 
leave tomorrow!"
"You can wait! Besdies he will chose me!"
"No me!"
"He is mine!"
"The guy is mine!"
"SHUT UP!!!" Sasami yelled. "You are acting like a bunch of 
15 year olds!" Ryoko shot back a remark. "Then why are you 
not fighting? You are 15!"
Tenchi yelled. Everyone shut up and went back to what they 
where doing. Usagi walked up to Tenchi. <I have an idea. 
Stay with Ryoko until the baby is about 10 then go to Juria 
with Ayeka...>

Epilog

Time passed quickly. The babby grew into a teenager and 
Ryoko had shown and told Hotaru about times when she and 
Tenchi grew up. Tenchi did deniy somethings but then noticed 
they where true. Sasami had stayed with Ryoko and Tenchi to 
help out, Washu left to go work on more experiments and 
Ayeka had left for home. Ryoko had then sent Hotaru to the 
school she went to when she meet ChibiUsa.
Rei and Chad had gone on tour, while Greg and Ami left to 
Germeny to be doctors and Ken and Makoto taught cooking 
lessons. ChibiUsa and Elios returned to Crystal Tokyo and 
Usagi and Mamuro left for America.
Things grew quite around the Masaki Shrine. Ryoko had 
learned to cook and Tenchi taught Hotaru the skills he had 
learned. 
"Tenchi! Hotaru!" Ryoko called on day. "Mahoshi is coming to 
vist this summer!"
That night Ryoko was soaking in the hot springs, she had put 
her bathing suit on and hid behind a rock. She saw Tenchi 
and he walked in the spring she then dove down and came up 
behind Tenchi by suprise. He screamed looked at Ryoko 
laughing. "That is not funny!"
"Come one Tenchi dear!" Ryoko laughed. "I mean you are 
leaving for Juria soon,"
"No I am not." Tenchi said. "I have learned that I belong 
here, not on a planet with royal people saying 'Oh Tenchi 
put you siut on worng!' or 'Tenchi that is the worng 
spoon!'"
Hotaru came in. "I heard screams, is everything ok?"
Ryoko and Tenchi blushed. "Everything is fine, just 
flurting." Ryoko asured her. 
Hotaru raised an eyebrow. "Really? I thought that you two 
where to old!" Ryoko got up and chaised her, leaving Tenchi 
alone. He looked up and saw something pass Earth. "What 
the?"
Giggling form both girls was heard. "Ok Hotaru-san time for 
bed!" "But I wanna soak in the hot spring." "You have a test 
tomomrrow, go to bed and get some rest! You can tomorrow 
since it is the last day for school."
Tenchi dove in the water knowing Sasami was coming and Ryoko 
was coming.
Sasami and Ryoko walked. "Where is he? I thought he was in 
here!" Sasami said. Ryoko smiled. "Ohh he is in here I know 
it."
