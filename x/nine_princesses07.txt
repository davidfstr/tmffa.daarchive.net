Hi again!  My disky thingy is screwed up again.  I hope I don't lose

Muyo or Sailor Moon.  Bye-bye for now.

	Raye was reading in the living room when there was a knock on the 
door.  She answered it.
	"Hi Raye!  Where's Sasami?" asked Rini.  Behind her were Hotaru 
and Serena.
	"Hi!  Rini and Hotaru came over to play with Sasami.  They've 
become pretty good friends," explained Serena.  Tenchi came into the 
room.
	"Hi Serena.  Rini, Hotaru, Sasami's waiting for you in the 
kitchen," Tenchi said.
	"Again?  You shouldn't make her work so hard!" Rini joked.  She 
and Hotaru went off to find Sasami.
	"Well, I'm going out to the garden.  You're welcome to stay for a 
while if you like, Serena," he said, then went out the door.
	"Come on Raye, I've got to talk to you," urged Serena, leading 
Raye out the door.  The girls walked a little way up the hill, then sat 
down beneath a cherry tree.
	"I wish the cherry blossoms would come out," complained Raye.
	"Yeah, but that's not what I want to talk about Raye," answered 
Serena.
	"Okay, what then?" asked Raye.
	"Diana saw you with Tenchi last night.  I warned you not to fall 
for him!" said Serena.
	"I'm not!  Look Serena, I couldn't sleep last night, so I went to 
the shrine to see if I could figure out what that vision means.  Tenchi 
was worried about me, so he followed me.  We just went to watch the 
stars and talk," said Raye indignantly.
	"Diana said he seemed to have a crush on you," accused Serena.
	"So?  He may have a crush me, but if you think I have any 
feelings for him you are dead wrong!"  said Raye.
	"Raye, I don't want to get in a fight now.  Just promise me you 
won't get close to him, if you know what I mean," Serena said.
	"Come on Serena!" Raye cried.
	"Promise me!" said Serena loudly.
	"Fine!  I promise I won't fall in love with him," promised Raye.
	"Thank you Raye.  I don't trust Tenchi, but I do trust you.  Even 
if you are overcritical and bossy" teased Serena.  Raye smiled.
	"You are so gonna pay for that!" laughed Raye.  The two girls 
raced each other down to the house, laughing all the way.

	Washu looked at her computer screen.  The tests were complete.  
She could safely conclude that Raye and her friends were not from 
Earth.  Well, she already knew about Setsuna.  She was giving off 
extremely strong power that was not of this planet. Washu shook her 
head.  It was easy to tell Tenchi and Raye had become friends.  How 
would he take it when he found out?
	Washu took a big breath and headed outside.
	"Tenchi?  You got a moment?" she called.  Tenchi put down the 
rake and walked over.
	"What's wrong Washu?" he asked.  She seemed a little nervous, as 
if she didn't want to talk to him.
	"It's about Raye.  And Serena and Hotaru and Amy and everyone 
else," she said.
	"What?" Tenchi wondered.
	"They're not from Earth.  I've been scanning some of Raye's DNA 
along with some of her friends.  They're basically aliens Tenchi," 
Washu said.
	"So is practically everyone else here," said Tenchi.
	"But you don't know about Raye.  What I've found out is she is 
extremely powerful and could be deadly," Washu warned.
	"I don't think Raye would ever hurt me," Tenchi replied.
	"I know she's your friend Tenchi, but I need you to promise me to 
stay away from her until I learn more about her," said Washu.  Tenchi 
sighed.
	"All right.  I promise."

***************
	Later, Serena took Rini and Hotaru home.  Tenchi looked at her.  
He realized that he had sensed the girl's power for a long time without 
realizing it.  Maybe he shouldn't trust Raye.  But then he looked at 
her.  She caught his eye but quickly turned away.   Wasn't it just the 
night before that he had sat with her under the stars talking?  She 
could have just attacked him then if that was her purpose.  Somehow, 
she didn't seem so threatening anymore.
	 Raye quickly looked at Tenchi.  He smiled at her.  He wouldn't 
hurt me.  If he wanted to, he could have last night, she thought.  She 
smiled back.

	Neither Tenchi nor Raye could sleep that night.  Sensing the 
other one's discomfort they both stood up and went to see if the other 
wanted to go for another late night walk.  They bumped into the other 
in the hall and started laughing.  It was a good thing that the others 
were heavy sleepers.
	"I was just wondering if you wanted to go for another walk.  I 
know you have problems sleeping," said Tenchi.
	"I was thinking the same thing," answered Raye.  The two walked 
to the same place where they had watched the stars the night before.
	"Tenchi, listen.  I've got to tell you something.  I'm not from 
Earth," said Raye.  To her surprise, Tenchi put his arm around her.
	"I know.  Washu tested your DNA and found you were extremely 
strong.  But would you mind telling me where you are from?" asked 
Tenchi.  Raye gulped.
	"I think it would be better if I showed you.  Mars Star Power!" 
she cried.  Tenchi gasped as fire surrounded her body and she 
transformed into Sailor Mars.
	"What are you?" Tenchi asked quietly.
	"My name is Sailor Mars.  I am the Princess of Mars sworn to 
protect Neo-Queen Serenity," she answered.
	"Why didn't you tell me?" asked Tenchi.
	"I was afraid.  You see, I've been sensing a power from you too, 
and I wasn't sure I could trust you," she replied.
	"Oh.  Well I guess I should show you something too," Tenchi drew 
his sword.
	"I'm the Prince of Jurai, sort of.  I don't want to be, but I am.  
I gave up the throne so I could live on Earth," said Tenchi.  Sailor 
Mars smiled.  She still had Raye's smile.
	"It's not a big deal.  I just wish I could've given up the throne 
on my planet," she replied.
	"Wait a minute.  You're still Raye aren't you?  Only she would 
say something like that," said Tenchi.
	"Kind of.  Raye was what I became after I was reborn," Mars 
answered.
	"Reborn?" asked Tenchi.  Sailor Mars explained the long story of 
the Silver Millenium.
	"I don't care.  You're still Raye to me, whether you're a 
princess or not," said Tenchi.  All of a sudden Raye hugged him.
	"Tenchi, you are the kindest and most understanding person I've 
ever met!" she cried.
	"Maybe.  All I know is that you are an amazing person.  Not to 
mention beautiful," he said softly.  
	"Tenchi," Raye murmured.  Tenchi drew her face closely and gently 
kissed her.  Both of them felt wonderful.  And terrible.
