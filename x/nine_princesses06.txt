Hi.  I took the little chant thingies from my fan book, so I'm pretty 
sure they're right.  And, in this story, I had Tenchi be the Jurai 
prince.  I don't think it's like that in all the episodes.  I don't own 
Tenchi or Sailor Moon.  ML!

	Raye couldn't sleep.  Too many bad vibes, she thought.  She could 
tell everyone except Tenchi and Sasami resented her presence.  
	"I need help," said Raye aloud.  She got up and dressed in her 
priestess outfit.  Then she headed out the door, and for the temple.  
She didn't see Diana following her.

	Tenchi woke with a start just in time to see Raye tiptoe past his 
door, dressed in her priestess outfit.  What's she doing going out at 
this time of night? He wondered.  Then for no reason, he dressed and 
followed her.
	Tenchi followed Raye to the temple, where she began to light a 
fire.  Tenchi waited quietly behind the door, watching Raye's every 
move.  As soon as the fire was large enough she knelt before it and 
began to chant.
	"Rin, Hyou, Tou, Sha, Kai, Chin, Retsu, Zai, Zen!" she chanted.  
Tenchi could see she was slipping into a trance.
	"I am flame, flame is light.  I am fire, fire is sight," she 
muttered over and over again.  Finally, Tenchi couldn't stand it.
	"Raye?" he called softly.  She didn't seem to hear him.  She just 
kept chanting.  He called her name again.  Still nothing.  Finally, he 
walked over to her and tapped her on the shoulder.  She blinked.
	"Tenchi? What are you doing here?" she said.
	"I was-um, I saw you leave," he finally managed to say.  "And, I 
wanted to make sure you weren't sneaking out."  
	Raye shrugged.  "Where would I go?" she asked.
	"I don't know.  Maybe you would go visit your friends," Tenchi 
suggested.
	"Yeah right.  I don't want to be lectured on how I shouldn't 
trust y-" she stopped.
	"They don't think you should trust me?" Tenchi asked, surprised.  
"Why?"
	"I guess they got freaked out by Ryoko," answered Raye.  "Hey, 
want to go for a walk?  I mean, I can't sleep and I don't really want 
to hang out here for the night."
	"Sure, I guess.  Come on, I'll show you a great place to watch 
the stars," answered Tenchi.

	"So, what were you doing up there?" asked Tenchi.
	"I was divining," answered Raye.
	"You mean like seeing the future?" replied Tenchi.
	"Not really.  I had this vision and," Raye stopped.  She realized 
Tenchi was staring into her eyes.  Wow, he has the most amazing eyes 
I've ever seen! she thought.
	"And?" Tenchi said, wanting her to continue.
	"And you were in it," she said softly.  She then explained her 
vision.
	"Raye, listen.  I had a vision just like that.  And you were in 
it too," Tenchi answered.  
	"What do you think it means?" Raye asked something.  
	"I think it means you and I are going to end up more than 
roommates," Tenchi said.  Both Raye and Tenchi were quiet for a long 
time.
	"Tenchi?  Where is Jurai?" asked Raye quietly.
	"Up there somewhere," Tenchi replied, pointing at the stars.  
"Maybe it's that red one."
	"No, that's Mars," answered Raye.  Tenchi looked at her.
	"How did you know that?  Do you study astronomy or something?" 
Tenchi asked.
	"You could say that," said Raye.  "But I've never heard of Jurai.  
Is it really a planet?"
	"It's where Aeka and Sasami are from, so has to exist.  And," 
Tenchi smiled, "I've been there."
	"Why would a person from Earth go there?  You are from Earth, 
aren't you?" Raye asked.
	"I don't know if I should tell you this," Tenchi said, his voice 
lowering, "but yes, I am from Earth."  They both laughed.
	"Well, we'd better go.  Ryoko and Aeka won't like it if you and 
me are alone for a long time," Tenchi said.
	"Define 'a long time'," replied Raye.
	"More than five minutes," answered Tenchi.
	They stood up and prepared to leave.
	"Thanks for hanging out with me Tenchi.  I mean most people would 
be worried and not want me to do stuff like this.  There was even this 
guy back in Tokyo--" Raye stopped.  There was hurt in Tenchi's eyes.
	"I mean, he wasn't my boyfriend or anything, he just thought he 
was," Raye saved.  But Tenchi still wasn't convinced.  There's no 
reason for him to be all upset unless, Raye thought suddenly, unless he 
had a crush on me!
	"It's okay Raye.  But I seriously doubt you don't have a 
boyfriend," Tenchi replied.
	"Why?" asked Raye.
	"Why?  Do you know what a mirror is?  Look at you!  You're 
pretty, you're smart, you're funny," Tenchi blushed.  "Need any more 
self esteem?  There's a sale."
	Raye laughed.  Tenchi was so sweet, and so funny.  Uh-oh thought 
Raye.  Serena's words were going through her mind.  Think of Chad.  
Think of Chad.  Think of Chad.
