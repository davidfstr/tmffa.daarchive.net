			   Part Four of Too Many

****************************************************************************

The story so far:

Ranma Saotome, man of action, switches places with Tenchi Masaki, weenie-man. 

The new Tenchi has difficulties fitting into his new life. First Ryoko chases 

him around, then Ryo-oh-ki triggers his fear of cats. The new Ranma doesn't 

fare much better, as Ryoga comes after him looking for blood. Meanwhile, Washu 

sends Ryoko off to spy on Cologne, owner of a local ramen hut and great-

grandmother to Shampoo, one of Ranma's self-appointed fiancees. Ryoko tries 

to leave the restaurant without paying, and winds up getting knocked cold by 

Cologne and arrested by the police. Ayeka and Sasami notice that Tenchi is 

acting oddly, and extreme paranoia sets in. Ryoga, trying to find Ranma, 

wanders into a mysterious laboratory...

And, now the fic drags on...

****************************************************************************

	The Nekohanten was busier than usual. Most of the tables were 

occupied as the restaurant was strained to accomodate the increased 

business. All this was creating extra work for Ranma, the cause of the 

increased business.

	"Hey doll! Two more orders of ramen over here please!" called a group 

of college students.

	"Right away!" called Ranma across the crowded restaurant, juggling six 

bowls of the hot noodles on her way to serve another group of customers. She 

narrowly dodged a small child running from the washroom as she placed the 

bowls down at the group's table.

	"Ok, who ordered the extra spicy?" she asked, looking around the faces 

of the leering men.

	"That would be me, hot stuff." replied the one furthest away.

	Ranma sighed and leaned across the table, planting the bowl in front 

of the man. He could feel the eyes of the others at the table on him, and 

did not like it one bit.

	This is all for a good cause, Ranma tried to convince himself as he 

placed the steaming bowls around the table. He heard the door to the shop 

open as even more customers entered. Ranma turned to greet the newcomers.

	"Hello Ranma!" said Nabiki.

	"Nabiki!" Ranma jumped in surprise.

	Nabiki steped out of the doorway and into the restaurant, followed by 

a few friends.

	"I didn't know you were working as a waitress," she commented, leaning 

close. "I like the outfit. VERY cute." she smiled.

	"Well," Ranma replied nervously, "it's a job."

	Nabiki paused to observe Shampoo rushing around to serve customers.

	"I don't suppose you've told Akane about this yet?" she asked calmly.

	"Huh?" Ranma responded, showing Nabiki's group to a table. "No."

	"I guess you'd like to keep it that way," said Nabiki, "now wouldn't 

you?"

	"I guess so," Ranma answered.

	"Well, I could make it so she doesn't find out."

	"Hey cutie!" someone called in the background. "Let's have some 

service!"

	"I'll be right with you!" Ranma called, turning to see where the voice 

had come from. "You'd do that for ME? Thanks Nabiki!"

	Nabiki opened her mouth to speak, but Ranma was already half-way 

across the restaurant, a big smile on his face. She frowned.

	"So that's how you want to play it, do you?" she said to herself.

                                 * * * * *

        Ryoko had a terrible headache.  She lay on a cot, she could sense.

It wasn't very comfortable. She rolled over on her side and stared at the

wall of her cell. Cell?

        "Hey! What's going on here?" she yelled, sitting up quickly.

        "You're in jail." a guard sitting nearby leaning back on a chair,

replied dryly. He coughed as he turned a page in his magazine.

        "I know that!" Ryoko responded angrily, crossing the cell and leaning

against the bars. "Would you mind telling me WHY I'm in this cell?"

	Ryoko suddenly realized that there were a lot of very good reasons

for her to be in jail.

	"Never mind," she said. "Where..."

        "I told you," the guard said, turning pages again, "you're in jail!"

        "Well, don't I get a phone call or something at LEAST?" she snarled

at the guard.

        "Yeah, yeah. We were just waiting for you to get up." the guard

replied, getting up and removing his keys from his belt. He sorted through

them and stuck one in the lock. "Thought you weren't ever going to get up."

        Ryoko stood aside as the door swung open.

        Hmmm, she thought, maybe I should just take this guy down and get the

hell out of here. She pondered this a moment, then thought of how people would

be likely to react. 

        "Tenchi, I'm back from the city!"

        "Yes, I saw it on the news."

        "Oh really?"

        "Well, a police station in the city was wasted by a mysterious woman

with pointy grey hair. Doesn't take much to put two and two together."

        Hmm.. not good.

        Ah well, might as well get Washu in on this. The whole thing was HER

fault anyway.

        "I was having a good dream." she spoke at the guard.

        "Yeah, whatever. This way, lady." he gestured down the hall.

                                 * * * * *

        Washu was making a call in her lab. For a change, she wasn't crossing

dimensions. Just series.

        She smiled as she looked down at the classified ad in the day's paper.

                WANTED: XJR-TRS80 components in 4587-C-POS class. Cash.
                email: natsume@apccgnn.jp

        "Cute." she spoke, switching on her terminal. She punched in the email

address and in a few moments, a phone number popped onto her screen. She

picked up her phone and clicked on the number. A few moments later, a voice

came on the line.

        "Hello?"
        
        "So," she spoke, "what what kind of cyborg are you building?"

        "Huh?" the man on the other end responded. "How'd you know that? Who

are you, anyway?"

        "Just an interested party. That's the only thing you would build

with parts like these," Washu stated. "It's the only thing those bloody

computers were ever useful for."

        "I see." the man laughed the laugh of a man without sleep. "Well,

I'm using my son's cat's brain..."

        A crab danced onto the corner of Washu's screen, holding a little

sign.

        "Wait a moment, could you hold for a second?" she asked. "I gotta

call coming in on my other line.

	"Uh, sure," the man replied.

	Washu pressed a button on the keyboard and there was a slight clicking 

noise.

	"Hello?" she said.

	"This is Captain Britian of the Tokyo Police Force," said a new voice.

        "What is it, captain?" Washu asked.

	"I'm looking for a Miss Washu," he replied.

	"Well you've found her, what do you want?"

	"We've got a woman here who claims to be your daughter."

	Ryoko, she thought. So that's where that fool had gone to.

	"Alright, what'd she do?"

	"Ah, so she is your daughter?"

        "I suppose you could say that. Can I speak to her, captain?"

        "Just a moment."

        There was a muffled exchange as the phone was handed to Ryoko.

        "Mommy?" she whimpered into the phone, "These big bad men have put me

in a cell for absolutely NO reason, and they won't let me go!"

        Washu sighed.

        "Save it for the judge." she growled into the phone.

        "But moooooommmm.....!" Ryoko cried.

        "SAVE IT!" Washu barked, "Put the captain back on."

        Ryoko stopped blubbering and tossed the phone back at the captain.

        "She wants to talk to you." she said.

        "Uh, hello?" Britain spoke into the phone, looking over at Ryoko.

She was too busy to notice, as she was trying to talk a guard to "lend her"

the keys to her cuffs.

        "I'll be down right away, Captain Britain." she said. "Just try and

keep her out of trouble until I get there."

        "No problem, Miss Washu. Thank you for being so understanding."

        "Goodbye." Washu hung up.

        Britain placed the receiver back on its cradle and looked back over

at Ryoko. The guard was trying to get her off of him as she clung to his leg.

He sighed.

        Damn I hate my job, he thought.
                                       
                                 * * * * *

        Ayeka and Sasami leaned against a pile of furniture they had just

finished stacking in front of the door to their room.

        "That should keep the clones out," said Ayeka, wiping the sweat from

her forehead.

        "Are you sure about this?" panted Sasami.

        "Why shouldn't I be?" Ayeka replied. She swallowed, trying to regain

her breath.

	"Maybe Tenchi's just not feeling well. Don't you think we're 

overreacting just a LITTLE bit?" She leaned over, staring up at her sister.

        Ayeka looked behind her and studied the homemade barricade they had

created in front of their door.

        "I don't know, maybe just a little bit." she said slowly.

        A voice came from within the barricade.

        "Your highness, I cannot move." said Azaka.

        "I believe that we must be able to move in order to protect you, your

majesty!" echoed Kamidake.

        "Just TALK to Tenchi," Sasami suggested, ignoring the pleading voices.

	"Me?" Ayeka replied. "Why me?"

	"You're the one who thought up this whole clone thing!"

	Ayeka considered this for a minute. Then she turned to look at the 

barricade again.

        "I suppose we'll have to do something about this," she said.

                                 * * * * *

	Ryoga was still lost. Now, he was walking down a narrow corridor 

formed by what appeared to be two giant metal boxes on either side.  There 

was a faint hum in the background. He could make out little more in the dim 

lighting.

        Ryoga continued on and eventually approached something resembling an 

intersection. Basically, the corners of four metal boxes met, with a little 

space between them. Ryoga walked into the intersection, and was immediatly 

hit on the right side. He fell to the floor, more because of shock than any 

actual pain.

        "Who's there?" he yelped, sitting up quickly.

	Ryoga turned to see who had hit him. He saw a young woman picking 

herself up off the floor. She looked around, and noticed him sitting on the 

floor.

        "Oh!" Mihoshi exclaimed, running over. "I'm sorry! Are you okay?"

	"Don't worry," Ryoga replied, getting up, "I'm fine."

	"That's good," Mihoshi said, smiling. "By the way, can you tell me 

something?"

	"What?" asked Ryoga.

        "How do I get out of here?"

        "I thought you knew." Ryoga replied, "Isn't this your place?"

        "Nope." Mihoshi replied brightly, "I have no idea where this is."

        Ryoga looked to the heavens.

        "Why me?" he cried.

                                 * * * * *

        Ryoko was lying on the cot again when Washu arrived. Ryoko stood up

as she saw Washu approach.

        "It's about time you got here," she complained, leaning against the

bars.

	Washu placed something on the ground a little distance outside the 

cell.

        "Ryoko, I told you to keep a low profile!" she scolded.

        "This is all your fault!" Ryoko accused.

        "I told you to WATCH the restaurant!" Washu stated, staring at a small

cube she held in her hand. "I don't remember telling you to run up a huge

bill and try to leave without paying!"

	"Are you getting me out of here or not?"

        "I don't know. You've caused a lot of trouble." Washu smiled.

        "What are you saying? You gonna let me rot in here?" Ryoko tried to

reach through the bars and grab Washu's shirt.

        "I'm not letting you out." she said.

        "Oh really?" Ryoko pulled at the bars, but was surprised when she

couldn't even bend them.

	"I figure that this'll keep you out of trouble until I've dealt with 

things." 

	"This cell? I could break out any time I want."

	"No you can't."

	"Yes I can."

	"No you can't."

	"Yes I can. Watch!"

        Ryoko threw a burst of energy against the far wall of the cell. There

was a large explosion, and a bright flash. When she looked at the wall again,

it was perfectly fine.

        "What?" she screamed, dashing over to the wall and running her hands

along the surface. "I didn't even SCRATCH it."

        Washu grinned. Ryoko sat down on her cot, her arms crossed.

        "You just be a good girl until I get back, okay?" Washu said.

	"Don't leave me stuck in here!" Ryoko pleaded.

        "Play with this," Washu suggested, tossing the multi-colored cube into 

the cell.

        Washu left. Ryoko tried to throw the cube out the window to her cell,

but it bounced off a field of some kind and hit her on the head. Ryoko fell

off the cot.

                                   * * * * *

	Ranma was greeted by Genma as he returned to the Tendo dojo.

	"Where have you been, my boy?" he asked. "I heard school was 

cancelled."

	"I was, uh, at work," Ranma explained.

	"Work?" Genma said.

	"Yeah, I thought since Mister Tendo was letting us stay at his house 

and eat his food..."

	"Ah! I see. You wanted to repay Soun."

	"Yeah, pretty much."

	"Tell you what, Ranma. Soun isn't here, but if you give the money to 

me, I'll make sure he gets it."

	"Uh, I guess..."

	Ranma held out the money he had earned, and Genma snapped it up.

	"Thanks, boy!" Genma said.

        Genma danced off out the door, leaving Ranma to stare down at his

empty hand.

        Hmm... maybe that wasn't such a good idea, he thought.

                                   * * * * *

        Kuno was standing on the street outside the school, holding a boken

in either hand.
               
        "I hope for his sake that Saotome presents himself soon," Kuno spake, 

"lest he incur the wrath of Blue Thunder."

        Wait, Kuno thinketh, he hast already incured my wrath!

        "That fiend!" he shouteth. "I avow my revenge twice over!"

                     [Dramatic lightning striketh]

                                 * * * * *

        Nabiki entered the front door of the Tendo Dojo.

        "I'm home!" she called as she removed her shoes.

        So, she thought, Ranma doesn't think I'll have the guts tell Akane.

He should have learned by now that I don't joke about these things. He should

have paid me when he had the chance.

	Nabiki walked up the stairs and knocked on the door to Akane's room.

	"Who is it?" Akane called from inside.

	"Nabiki," she replied.

	"What is it?" asked Akane.

	"Could I come in?"

	"Go ahead."

	Nabiki opened the door, stepped inside, and shut the door again behind 

her.

	Akane was at her desk, finishing some schoolwork. She turned in her 

seat to face Nabiki.

	"What is it, Nabiki?" she asked.

	"I just got some information about Ranma," Nabiki replied, "and I was 

quite certain you'd be interested."

	"No, Nabiki," Akand replied. "I still remember what happened last time 

you tried to sell me information about Ranma."

        "I'm shocked," Nabiki tried to sound surprised. "I had no intention 

of charging you! I wouldn't dream of keeping important information like this 

from my own sister!"

	"Really?" Akane said with a surprised look on her face.

	"Of course!"

	"Then what is it?"

	"Ranma's got a job..."

	"That's it?"

	"I'm not finished yet. Ranma's working at the Nekohanten."

	"What?"

	"With Shampoo."

	"That jerk!"

        Akane pushed Nabiki aside, threw open her door, and stormed out of

the room.

        Nabiki smiled to herself.

        Sorry Ranma, but business is business, she thought.

                                 * * * * *

	Tenchi had done about as much tilling as he could handle, and was 

walking back to the house. As he approached, he noticed Ayeka hanging part-

way out of her window. As he watched, she slowly slid out of the window.

        "Ayeka! What are you doing?" he called.

        She turned her head to see where he was, tried to wave, realized she

needed both arms, struggled to regain her balance and climb back in, slipped,

and fell into a bush below. Tenchi rushed towards the impact site to see what

was going on.

        "Are you okay, Ayeka?" he called, running up to where she had landed.

	There was movement in the bush.

        "Yes!" the bush called back. "I'm fine!"

        Tenchi got closer and saw Ayeka head first in the bush, struggling to

free herself.

	"Are you sure?" he asked.

        "Yes," the shrub replied, "quite certain."

        Give me a break, Tenchi thought. She can't get herself out of a

shrubbery!

        Tenchi grabbed Ayeka and lifted her out of the bush, gently placing

her back down on the ground.

        "Why thank you Tenchi," she said, standing up and adjusting her

clothing. "I didn't mean to be a bother."

	"No problem," Tenchi replied. "Are you okay?"

        "I'm fine, now that I'm out of that bush."

	"That's good to hear."

	Tenchi began to walk inside.

	I'm neglecting my duty, Ayeka thought. I have to find out if this is 

the real Tenchi.

        "Are you okay?" she called.

	"Huh?" said Tenchi, turning around.

	"I asked if you were okay," Ayeka repeated. "It's just that you had 

that fight with Ryoko the other day, and Sasami said you ran and hid in the 

forest when she and Ryo-oh-ki came out to help you."

	"Uh, yeah," Tenchi sputtered, "well, I was, uh, just playing a little 

game."

	A game, Tenchi thought, now THERE'S a lame excuse. She's gonna find me 

out for sure.

	Ayeka giggled.

	"A game?" she asked.

        Tenchi decided to change the subject.

	"By the way," he said, "where IS Ryoko?"

	"What?" said Ayeka.

	"Well, she's been gone since this morning," Tenchi stated.

        "She's probably gotten into the sake," Ayeka suggested.

        "And Mihoshi's been gone since yesterday as well," Tenchi added.

	"Now that you mention it, that is strange."

	"Have you seen Sasami lately?"

	"She's in our room."

	Tenchi may be acting a little odd, Ayeka decided, but there's 

something stranger going on.

	"If you're worried," she suggested, "we can talk to Washu."

	"Nah," Tenchi began walking inside. "It's probably nothing serious."

	Ayeka thought about it for a minute, and decided that she should check 

with Washu. She walked into the house and over to the door to Washu's lab. 

She opened the door and leaned inside. The lab appeared to be empty.

        That's odd, Ayeka thought, closing the door.

                                 * * * * *

	Ryoga stopped walking for a moment and turned around. He saw that 

Mihoshi was still following him.

	"Why are you still following me?" he demanded.

        "I'm lost!" Mihoshi whined.

        "Didn't you hear me?" Ryoga yelled. "I'm lost too!"

	Mihoshi began to look around in a panic.

	"Don't you have ANY idea where we are?" Ryoga asked.

	"No!" Mihoshi replied. "I just walked into Washu's lab and..."

	"Lab?" Ryoga said. "This is a lab?"

	He looked around. He was surrounded by glass cases, enclosing large 

areas. Inside these cases were various habitats. One case nearby seemed to 

contain a small swamp, and another a forest. Inside each of the cases a 

variety of animals could be seen darting back and forth.

        If this IS a lab, Ryoga thought, it's a BIG lab. Damn.

                                 * * * * *

	Ranma was in his room, hoping to avoid trouble for the rest of the 

day. He heard a thumping coming down the hall. Akane threw the door open.

	"You got a job as a waitress?" she screamed.

	Uh oh, Ranma thought.

	"Don't you have any self-respect?" Akane continued.

	"It, it paid well," Ranma stuttered.

	"Paid well?" Akane shrieked, winding up.

	"Yeah, well," Ranma stumbled, "I kind of wanted to repay your dad for 

giving me a place to sleep and food to eat."

        "You what?" Akane asked, stopping in mid swing.

	"Well, I didn't want to be a freeloader."

	Akane stared, wide-eyed.

	"Hey," said Ranma, "are you okay?"

                                 * * * * *

	The bell by the door rung, announcing a new customer had arrived at 

the Nekohanten.

	Shampoo walked over to help the newcomer find a seat.

	"Welcome," she said. "Would you like table?"

	"Yes please," answered Washu.

	"Follow Shampoo please," Shampoo said.

	Shampoo led Washu to a small table in a corner of the restaurant.

	"Shampoo be back soon to take your order," Shampoo said once Washu was 

seated.

        Well, Washu thought, let's see if she recognizes me.

        She settle back to wait.

                                 * * * * *

	Why's it so dark? Ryoga wondered.

	"Are we still lost?" Mihoshi asked.

        "Yes," Ryoga replied patiently, "we are still lost."

	"Oh," Mihoshi said.

	Ryoga continued foreward, but suddenly bumped into a wall. He tried to 

see what he had just hit, but he couldn't. As his eyes adjusted to the low 

light level, he realized that he had bumped into a thick pane of glass.

        "What is it?" Mihoshi asked behind him.

	"Just a glass wall," Ryoga replied.

	Ryoga put his hands up against the glass, and began to walk sideways 

along the glass. He got several meters before bumping into another pane on 

his right.

	"What now?" Mihoshi asked.

	"Just another pane of glass," Ryoga replied.

	"Why's that there?" asked Mihoshi.

	Ryoga considerd the problem a bit. No, he thought, it's not possible.

	"We didn't walk INTO a specimen container," he shouted, "did we?"

	There was a growling noise in response.

        "Waaashuuu," a voice whispered from the darkness.

	Ryoga turned around to see a large man with a huge sword sitting in 

the corner, gripping his knees as he rocked back and forth. He decided to 

get out of there as fast as possible.

	"What is that?" Mihoshi asked.

	"Will you stop asking those annoying questions?" Ryoga screamed.

	The man in the corner began to stand up.

	Time to go, Ryoga decided.

        He ran back a few steps and drew his umbrella. He flung in against the

wall in front of him as hard as he could. The pane shattered.

	"Let's go," he called to Mihoshi.

	They both ran back out into the maze of specimen containers.

                                 * * * * *

                         So endeth the fourth part.

                                 * * * * *

Allan's Notes:

We're starting to wade through some of the more plot-intensive volumes, so 
please bear with us. Hopefully, we're faring pretty well still. We've 
finally gotten an idea where this series is headed.

I'd also like to thank everyone who's sent in comments so far. Pretty much 
all the feedback has been positive, and the criticisms that have been made 
were all quite valid. Almost everyone (except Mike) said they were looking 
forward to the next volume, so I hope we haven't kept you waiting too long.

I guess that's it for now. On with the bios.

Character Bios: (Still in order of appearance.)

Police Guard:		Again, look at the comment for the bus driver in 
                        volume one.

Third guy on phone
with Washu:             As always, no clues! If you've seen enough anime, 
                        you'll know. There are BIG hints.

Captain Britain:        He's from Dominion Tank Police. As you can guess, 
                        he's the captain. Another cameo appearance. Although,
                        he's somewhat normal in this one.

Guy in specimen tank:	When it happens, you'll know.

Shamus' Notes:

Well, this one we actually did a layout sheet for, so it wasn't too bad.
We've thought and laid out all the way up until volume 7 so far, and all
we have to do it get the bloody things typed out. We spent most of the day
with me on one computer doing the webpage and Allan in here typing in story.
Now we've switched, I've done my notes, and have to re-write most of this 
thing while Allan types in bios for the webpage. Yes, I KNOW not much happened
in this volume. We can't have something happen in EVERY volume.

The new webpage is up, by the way, at:

        http://www.geocities.com/tokyo/towers/1525/

Big thanks go to ZodiacX for hosting my page for awhile. It will still be
there, but won't be updated as often as the Geocities one.

Vol.5 will be out.... well... let's hope for soon.

Bai bai, all...

                                        ...and check out the damn webpage ^_^
