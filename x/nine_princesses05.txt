Hello again!  Who likes the story so far?  Don't answer that.  I'm not 
sure I like it myself.  But, Selenity will kill me if I don't post it, 
so I have to.  I don't own Tenchi or Sailor Moon.  I'll have a wittier 
intro next time.

	"Hi!  Wait!  Miss-Miss Setsuna?"  Tenchi opened the door.  He was 
expecting Raye and her friends over for dinner, not his math teacher.  
The tall, mysterious looking woman smiled.
	"I'm with Raye," she explained.
	"Hey Tenchi.  Can you help me with this stuff?" Raye poked her 
head out from behind Miss Setsuna.
	"Sure.  Where's everyone else?"  Tenchi asked.  He was answered 
by two little girls about Sasami's age.
	"Haruka was right.  He is cute," said the one with pink pigtails.  
Her friend, a girl a little older with short black hair giggled.  
Tenchi blushed.
	"Hi, what's your name?"  he asked.
	The girl with pink pigtails, who appeared to be the spokesperson 
for the two girls said, "I'm Rini, and this is my best friend Hotaru."  
Hotaru smiled shyly.  Suddenly Sasami rushed into the room.
	"Oh my goodness!  Company already!  I'm such an awful hostess," 
she cried.  Rini and Hotaru bounded over to her.
	"You don't have to be a hostess.  You're just a kid like us.  You 
don't have to do stuff like that!"  exclaimed Rini.
	"But if I don't, who will?" said Sasami.
	"Don't worry, we'll help you," reassured Hotaru, speaking for the 
first time since they got there.  Rini and Hotaru went into the kitchen 
with Sasami.
	"Well, that gets rid of them for a while," said Serena, stepping 
through the door.  She turned to Tenchi.  "Sorry if I was a little 
emotional the first time we met.  I'm Serena, remember?"
	"Yeah, are you feeling better about your boyfriend?" Tenchi 
asked.  The girl he remembered as Lita answered for her.
	"She should.  She's ran up the phone bill like you wouldn't 
believe, calling and E-mailing him," she laughed.
	"Tenchi," came a voice.  Ryoko drifted in through the wall.  The 
other girls took a step back in surprise.
	"Sorry if I seem rude.  My name is Ryoko," she said.
	"How did you do that?  Are you a magician or something?" cried 
Mina.
	"Oh!  Yes!  Ryoko's the best magician ever!  She's traveled all 
around the world doing stunts like that!" said Tenchi rather loudly, 
trying to cover up for Ryoko.  He grabbed her wrist.  "I think we need 
to talk," he muttered in her ear, then turned back to the slightly 
nervous Scouts.  "Will you excuse us please?"
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Ryoko!  What are you doing?  I told everyone to behave semi-
human!  I'm trying to make friends with these girls, and if they find 
out I'm living with a bunch of space women, they'll freak out!" cried 
Tenchi.  Ryoko pouted.
	"I don't see why you want to be friends with them anyway.  Why 
don't you just be friends with me Tenchi?" asked Ryoko sweetly.	
	"You're impossible, you know that?  Just play it low-key for 
now," Tenchi said.  Ryoko nodded, then scooped him up in a big hug.
***********************************************************************

	"That was really weird," said Serena.
	"Maybe Haruka and Michiru were right, Raye.  That girl was no 
magician.  She was-" Mina thought a moment, "something else."
	"Look, maybe Tenchi's got a thing for psycho women, but other 
than that he's normal," Raye said.
	Setsuna was silent.  Tenchi was a nice boy, no doubt about that.  
But she, like her friends, believed there was something more to him 
than one could see.  Suddenly, someone tapped her on the back.
	Setsuna whirled around to see a girl with bright green eyes 
staring at her.  The girl's long, spiky red hair hung down her back.
	"Hi, my name's Washu," she said.  But it was as if she could see 
into Setsuna's mind.  
	You're not from Earth.  What are you doing here? Setsuna "heard" 
in her mind.  Her eyes widened, and she placed a hand to her mouth.
	Tenchi walked back in the door.
	"Thank you for having the girls over Tenchi, but I'm not feeling 
all that well.  I'm going to go now, and I'll come pick the girls up at 
Ten okay?" she said, then walked out the door.  Tenchi found all of the 
girls staring at him.
	"Well!  Let's see if dinner's ready!" he proclaimed.
***********************************************************************
***************
	The rest of the evening went smoothly.  He could see friendships 
forming between Washu and Amy, Aeka and Mina, and Lita and Kiyone, who 
was back from patrol.  Sasami, Rini, and Hotaru spent the evening 
giggling over who knows what, and playing with Ryo-Ohki and Rini's cat, 
Diana.  Of course, Serena and Mihoshi both acted like their 
bubbleheaded selves, and made dinner slightly interesting by eating 
almost everything in sight.
	Tenchi had drawn his own conclusions about each of the girls.  
Lita was athletic, yet extremely feminine, whose hobbies were cooking 
and gardening.  Mina was a wannabe star, who talked a little too much 
and a little too fast for her own good.  Amy, Tenchi already knew 
pretty well.  She was quiet, brainy, and very sweet.  Serena was ditzy, 
slightly rude, and very lovable.  Rini and Hotaru were always together, 
and were exact opposites of each other.  Rini was a lot like Serena, 
only more polite and loud.  Hotaru didn't talk much, and when she did, 
it was only to Rini or Sasami.
	But Tenchi felt like he knew Raye forever, even though he just 
met her a few days ago.  She was mysterious, but had a very short 
temper, and started a lot of fights with Serena.  Later, Raye told him 
it was because Serena was her best friend.  For some reason, it made 
sense to Tenchi.  Soon, it was getting late.  Most of the girls were 
waiting outside for Setsuna, but to his surprise, Serena pulled Tenchi 
away.
	"Listen Tenchi.  You seem like a nice guy, but only Raye seems to 
really trust you.  What I'm saying now is, if you do anything to hurt 
her, you will pay for it," Serena said rather menacingly.  Then walked 
away.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Raye, can I talk to you for a minute?" asked Serena.  Raye 
followed her outside.
	"Look Raye, I still don't know if we can trust Tenchi.  What I do 
know is, you can take care of yourself.  I'll try to keep Haruka and 
Michiru out of your hair at school.  But listen, even if I don't know 
anything else, I've got to tell you about something I do know about, 
love.  Tenchi is the kind of person you could fall in love with.  Heck, 
I'd fall in love with him if I didn't have Darien.  So if you feel like 
you're starting to fall in love with him, think of Chad.  Think of Chad 
who saved your life more that once, whose heart you've broken but 
always repaired, and who loves you with all his heart.  Because if you 
do fall in love with Tenchi, Raye, you may not be able to take care of 
yourself."
	Serena walked out the door.  A few moments later, the sound of 
Setsuna's car drove away.  Raye turned to Tenchi.
	"It's getting late.  I'm going to bed.  See you in the morning 
Tenchi!" Raye said.  She was thinking about Serena's warning.  She 
looked at Tenchi one more time.  I'm not falling in love with him.  I'm 
not.
