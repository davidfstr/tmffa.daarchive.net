	Well here's part 3 of No need to be Wild again I have to thank
my pre-readers for without them this chapter would have been alot more
deficient. Once again Tenchi Muyo belongs to Pioneer and Ranma 1/2 to VIZ
also I have to give credit to Peter Suzuki whose loving dare launched
this response.

kappa- a water demon that resembles a cross between duck billed platapus
       with a turtle shell 
Nani- what? what the?
Sumimasen- I'm sorry

	A myriad of emotions played ranged across the Tendo sister's faces as
they looked at the young man that called himself Ranma Saotome. Kasumi looked
on with a worried and skeptical expression. Nabiki kept her poker face on
only raising an eyebrow at the annoucement. Ranma look saddened as he caught
sight of the youngest Tendo. Akane glared angerly at Ranma and scowled to
show her displeasure at his true gender holding her cup of water with a grip
that threatened to break it.

	"Okay nice joke but what is this all about?" was all Nabiki could say
to sum up the confusion of the situation.

		      No need to be Wild:
		Tenchi Muyo-Ranma 1/2 crossover

Part 3: Much ado about Washu


	"Are you really her?" Kasumi started looked directly at Ranma, "That
same young girl we saw before?"

	Genma pushed his glasses up slightly his eyes closed in
contemplation. "Hmm...how do I best explain all this?" He then looked toward
his son.

	Ranma gave Genma the 'do it and die by Washucide' look and any
thought of using his son as a demonstration quickly faded from his mind.

	Genma sighed then upended a bucket of water from nowhere over
himself. Suddenly where there once was a sligtly overweight bespectled man
now stood a huge black and white giant panda. A gi bluging out in areas that
were now too much flesh to contain and a pair of rim eyeglasses barely 
hanging on one ear of the animal.

	Nabiki's face registared shock for a moment before returning to
normal, Soun simply nodded, and Akane's mouth dropped open her anger
momentarily forgotten. "Oh my!" Kasumi's exclamation broke the silence as
she placed her hand on her cheek.

	"So that means Ranma also..." Nabiki stated as all attention turned
to the 16 year old boy.

	"Well there's only one way to find out." Akane stated with a grin
as she clutched her glass of water and was about throw it in Ranma's
direction.

	However before Akane could do anything the panda quickly knocked the
glass out of her hands. The panda then produced a wooden sign [Are you mad
girl, do you have any idea what horror you'll unleash if you douse my son!]

	Soun looked at his old friend skeptically. "Oh come now Genma she
can't be that bad." he was promptly grabbed by the front of his gi as the
panda looked at him in terror.

	[You don't understand Tendo!] the panda started shaking Soun, [that
little red head is a demon from hell. She's worse then the Master, we must
get rid of her or suffer in eternal torment and what suffering she can
inflict on you just by a wave of her fingers, oh the Humanity!]

	"Ahem." a voice coughed causing the four people to refocus their
attention on the figure still sitting behind them.

	There sat a long red haired girl with green eyes in Ranma's chinese 
shirt and pants at her feet was the glass that Genma carelessly tossed away
it's contents now covering the girl. The girl smiled toward Genma "Well,
Genma," Washu stood up and suddenly her holographic computer was at her side
as the panda started shaking uncontrollably. "It seems your tact matches
that stuff in your skull you dare call grey matter."

	Genma looked around frantically for an exit. Seeing none the giant 
panda glared knives at the pint-size genius for a moment, crouching itself
low and then, before Washu could do a thing, he sprang into action...

	and started kowtowing while holding a sign saying [I'm sorry] over
and over again.

	The Tendo's merely fell face first to the floor while Washu stood
there eyes half shut as a small drop of sweat traveled down the side of her
head.

	Washu recovered quickly and began typing commands onto her computer
"Now, Now furball take your punishment like the _man_ you are."

	Abruptly the air around Genma-panda shimmered for a moment then as 
the light died down he was gone. 

	*ribit*

	The sound caused the Tendo's to look down. There at about an inch or
two high was a kappa-panda.

	"Oh my!" Kasumi started as she walked up to the small animal, 
"Saotome-san your--" Everyone held there breath waiting for Kasumi's
response.

	"So cute!" Kasumi beamed as she picked up the panda-kappa and
hugged it.

	The rest of the Tendo clan sweated nervously while Washu smiled
triumphantly.

	"Yup, got to love my patented kappification process," Washu nodded
with closed eyes her arms crossed over one another, "all you have to do is
rewrite the subject's DNA code then speed up the metabolism, and presto." 

	"Bwhahahaha am I the greatest scientific genius in the universe or
what?" Suddenly Washu produced a Japanese fan and waved it around as two 
small hand puppets that resembled Washu appeared on the girls shoulders. 
"Washu you are the greatest!" puppet A said, "All bow before the great
Washu!" B added.

	The Tendos stood rooted to the spot until the puppets disappeared
and Washu sat back down.

	"I guess you're all wondering how all of this occurred." Washu looked
down with a small grin at Genma. "And since Genma here won't be able to talk
for awhile, I might as well inform you."

	Washu again called up here holographic computer as she enlarged the
screen so all could see. "You see it all started here at the base of Mount
Quanjing in the Qinghai province of China..."

***Flashback***

	Ranma smirked as he landed on the bamboo pole with ease.  He had
just knocked his father into one of the springs.  That selfish old goat had
it coming to him. Dragging his own son across the country, forcing him to
learn ancient sometimes even forbidden techniques, forcing HIM to work off 
their bills by taking odd jobs. Well no more.  As of today, his pop would 
have to live with the fact that he was again beaten by his own son.

	Of course, Ranma soon realized that his father seemed to be down
there a long time.  "Pop? What’s up?" asked Ranma, not hinting his slight
worry about the well being of the only family he knew about.  "We done 
already?"

	All of a sudden, with a loud *BLOOOSH!!* something he did not expect,
took his father’s place. What now stood on an opposite pole, while 
resembling Ranma’s father in some ways, was not Genma Saotome.
The guide should have known that something like this would happen.
All he could do now was explain what had happened, and hope that those two
would not continue to fight.  "Oh, too bad.  Mr. customer fall in ‘Spring of
Drowned Panda’.  Very tragic story of panda, who drown there two thousand
year ago.  Now who ever fall in same spring, take body of panda."
Explained the guide.

 	"You never said anything about that, to us!" yelled the boy. "Me
Japanese is not so good, no?  Me speak English fine, but me no speak 
Japanese well."  Just then, tragedy struck.  It did not exactly seem that
way at first, when the panda knocked the boy from the pole.  So the boy 
would fall in one of the springs, so what.  Worse had happened before.  But 
the panda had gotten in a very good hit, and combine that with its improved 
strength, it knocked the boy very far indeed.  In fact, the hit caused the
boy to fly directly towards the only COVERED spring in Jusenkyo.

	Covered because of what was in it.  The guide was so terrified that
he did not even respond when the panda tried to get his attention. Ranma was
hit, and he knew that it was his fault.  He had been distracted by the 
guides words, and that panda, no wait, his FATHER had gotten in a good shot.

	Ranma realized that when, not IF, he fell into one of the springs, he
would take the form of whatever drowned there many years ago.  What would he
be?  A duck?  A pig?  A girl?  A c-c-cat?  Perhaps a yeti, riding a bull, 
carrying a crane and an eel?  The worst that could happen, would be that he
would create a ‘Spring of Drowned Ranma’.  Then he realized where he was
heading.  <Oh, wonderful.> He thought.  <I’m going to smash through some
boards before I get cursed.  I wonder why they covered it up, anyway?>  As 
he smashed into the boards, he realized probably why the spring was boarded
up. 

*CRACK!*

	To keep whatever drowned there from coming back.

*SPLOOOSH!*

	The guide tried to run, but he was stopped by a furry paw.  The man
that was transformed into a panda, held up a piece of wood, that had some 
writing on it.  [What spring was that?] The guide starred nervously at the
spring as he spoke.  "That is ‘Spring of Drowned Goblin’. Very tragic story
of goblin that drown in that spring, seven hundred year ago.  No one want 
dangerous goblin to come back, so people try to keep all from falling in 
spring."

	The panda scribbled something else down on the wood.  [If the goblin
was so dangerous, then what’s so tragic of it drowning?]

	"No, no, no.  Mr. customer no understand.  Story no is tragic because
goblin drown in spring."

	Just then, *FOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!!* a bright column of pale green 
light shot from the spring, and while thankfully drying up the spring itself,
there was something still in the now dry pit.

	"Story is tragic because goblin may one day come back." Said the
guide nervously.

	The creature that WAS Ranma, seemed to be considering the situation.
It then slipped out of Ranma’s Gi pants, and slung them over its shoulder.  
Seemingly making one final adjustment on its belt, it then turned around, 
and approached the slightly frightened person and panda.  When it finally 
reached the two, they seemed to lose their fear to curiosity.

	Ranma didn’t look anything at all like Ranma.  Standing three feet in
height, with sparkling green eyes, and with spiky crab-red hair, Ranma did 
not resemble anything like he used to. The panda furiously scribbled
something down on a piece of wood, and showed it to the guide.

	"Yes, sir.  Me think that goblin, that legend talk about." Said the
guide, with a trace of uncertainty in his voice.

        "You’re probably both wanting an explanation, aren’t you?" asked
Ranma, who now sounded somewhat like a twelve year old girl.  Both the guide
and the former human nodded in affirmation, so she continued.  "First of all,
that wasn’t a goblin that fell there all of those years ago.  I was a great 
scientist. In fact I was," dramatic pose.  " ‘The Greatest Scientific Genus 
In The Universe!!!’ BWA-HA-HA-HA!!!" As she spoke two mini replicas of 
herself appeared on her shoulders chanting "Washu, Washu, she’s the best!  
Yay, WASHU!!"

	"Washu?!?" asked the guide and panda. . .  Okay, the panda grunted it
out the best it could. 

	"Yes, my name was Washu.  Don’t worry, I’m Ranma as well.  Our
personalities kind of merged when I, er, he fell into the spring." As if to 
prove what she was saying, she launched a flying spin kick on a nearby wooden
post, the top half of which imbedded itself in the nearby cliff.  Genma knew 
that if this wasn’t Ranma, then this Washu was imitating Ranma’s moves
exactly. Washu approached the panda. "Call me Washu-chan, when I am in 
this form, and Ranma when I am in my other form.  And don’t worry pop.  You
haven’t lost a son.  You’ve gained a brilliant, and very cute, scientist."

	Genma was not believing a word of this.  Somehow this goblin had
taken control of his son.  He needed to get his son back to normal.  He
wrote this down on a piece of cardboard, and showed it to the guide.  The 
guide nodded in affirmation and took out a kettle of hot water that he had
been preparing. The guide then dumped its contents on top of Washu, changing
her back to the pigtailed boy, that was Ranma.

	"Ranma, my boy!  Now you’re back to normal.  Now we can go about
finding a cure for you!" Genma would have said, if he wasn’t still a panda.
Ranma glared at the guide, steam coming off of his head from the
boiling hot water that was just dumped over him.  Ranma then materialized a
twelve-by-eight rectangular shadow, and typed on a couple of buttons that 
made their existence known when he pressed them. 

	Suddenly the guide was strapped to an invisible rack, arms and legs
stretched out and held down by energy bands. "WHAT!?!  No is possible!  
Spring that change mind, supposed to change back with hot water!" 

	"I already told you, I ‘merged’ with Washu.  My mind stays the same
in either form." Genma backed away from his son.  "Now, what would be a 
suitable punishment for trying to take away my genius, not to mention the
crime of keeping a cute widdle scientist like Washu-chan from living 
again? Hmmmmmm. . .   Ah-Ha!" Ranma typed some buttons.  "Now this will be
fun."

	The air above the helpless Jusenkyo guide started shimmering, and 
then he transformed.  The guide dropped to the ground, and now was a Kappa
(Water sprite). "Ribbit!  Ribbit!" complained the Kappa.

	"Just accelerate their metabolism, and VIOLA!  One Kappa! HA-HA-HA!!"
Ranma was enjoying this a bit too much.

	Genma tried to knock his son out, in order to stop the ‘mad
scientist’.  Ranma anticipated the attack, and used the panda’s momentum to
toss him on to the ground. "Now, that wasn’t a very nice thing to do to your
Super-Genius son.  Was it." Ranma pressed a couple more buttons, and a 
stream of boiling hot water poured on to the panda, changing it back to a 
human.

	"Yow!  Ow!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!" Genma ran around in circles, to afraid
to jump into any of the springs because of what they might do, and in too 
much pain to do anything else. Ranma pulled a mirror seemingly out of
nowhere, and checked his face. "So I’m now handsome, instead of cute.  I’m 
still," dramatic pose.  " ‘The Greatest Scientific Genus In The Universe!!!’
BWA-HA-HA-HA!!!"  On cue, two mini RANMA’S appeared on his shoulders 
cheering, "You’re the best!  You’re the coolest!  Yay, RANMA!!"

***End of Flashback***


	The room was silent as Washu finished her story only the soft ringing
of the wind chime could be heard.

	"Fortunately for both Ranma-dono and myself the merging of our two
personalities was temporary. Although our personalites tend to overlap from
time to time, they have diverged back into two separate entities." Washu 
finished waiting for some reaction from her audience.

	"Sort of like oil and water Washu-chan." Nabiki stated breaking the
silence. 

	"In a way yes Nabiki-dono," Washu praised as she smiled at the middle
Tendo. "It's so refreshing to meet someone who uses their brain for a 
change." Washu then glared at Genma who tried to hide somewhere.

	"The legendary ground of the accursed springs," Soun began sweating
profusely a look of horror on his face. "It's true horror has always been a
mystery until now..."

	"Wait a minute." Akane said as she gave the small scientist an
appraising look. "If your so powerful how come you drowned at Jusenkyo
and for that matter how come you can't separate your personalities?"

	"It's rather complicated story." Washu stated cryptically as she
started scratching her chin slowly in contemplation. <What's wrong Washu?>
Ranma thought.

	<I can't tell them the whole story Ranma-dono.> Washu replied warily
<Not yet anyway.> Washu amended.

	<Well...> Ranma hesitated before an idea struck him. <Why don't you
tell them a shorter version of what you told me. You don't have to go into 
great detail about nothin' you don't want to.> Ranma stated.

	Washu grinned for a moment <Ranma-dono it doesn't happen too often
but you amaze me sometimes.>

	"Well lets just say I was imprisoned in a unique cage and sent adrift
by my captor." Washu started looking intently at Akane. "After a long time
my prison drifted into this solar system and my trajectory coincided with
that of Planet Earth." 

	"My 'prison' crash landed on a village not too far from Jusenkyo."
Washu sighed, "Unfortunately the natives saw me inside my prison and mistook
me for a malevolent being falling from the heavens."

	"At first they thought of constructing a shrine around me to contain
my 'demonic' presense." Washu giggled momentarily, "But someone suggested 
taking me and locking me up in a cave near Jusenkyo 'Lest someone frees her
from the prison'."

	Washu proceeded to reach her hand into a subspace pocket and produced
a cup of green tea which she drank before continuing. "The men who were
assigned to carry me to Jusenkyo probably were clumsy with my handling
and they dropped me at some point causing my prison to fall into a spring."

	"I don't recall much after that moment." Washu finished taking a sip
of her tea again as the Tendo's absorbed the petite genius's tale.

	Akane was about to ask her last question again but Washu interrupted
"As for why I can't cure the curse, it's the results that bother me."

	The Tendo's looked at Washu with blank stares causing the small
red head to laugh nervously.

	"Oh, don't get me wrong," The Tendo's could only watch and sweat
nervously as numerous-some very sharp, gruesome, or otherwise wierd
looking-instruments appeared in Washu's hands. "As the greatest scientist in
the universe I have an unlimited choice of facilites to employ in curing
Ranma-dono and myself of Jusenkyo's unique anatomical and physiological
conditioning."

	"The only problem is I don't know how the curse will react with the
methods I employ," Washu then produced a pointer in her hand as a project
appeared in front of her and each of the Tendo's found themselves sitting
in school desks. "For example I could clone Ranma using a small sample of DNA
and then download his personality into the clone. But if the curse is genetic
in nature I could wind up giving the boy a cursed clone body. On the plus
side at least we'll have two separate bodies for each personality."

	Washu then looked at her 'students' with a grin, "Any questions?"

	"Umm...not at the moment" Akane said quietly confusion still 
apparant in the girls tone.

	"Very informative." Nabiki stated her professional face showing no
hint of emotion save curiosity.

	"Definately." Kasumi agreed nodding her head.

	Genma raised a flipper. "Yes, Genma-chan?" The kappa-panda brought
out a large wooden sign. [Oh great scientist Washu-sama, I humbly beg you
please change me back.]

	Washu scratched her chin for a moment then grinned mischievously.
"Sure." 

	As before a light around Genma shimmered turning him back into a
panda just in time to recieve a stream of boiling water from a kettle that
Soun Tendo held up with a heavy cloth on the bottom. The panda flayed in 
agony as Soun finished pourring half of the kettles content's on it.

	"So when doused with hot water you return to your human form." Soun
stated looking the now human, and mysteriously dressed, Genma in the eyes.

	"It needn't be quite that hot Tendo." Genma exclaimed his skin now
scolded a bright red.

	"And you turn into a girl with cold water and back to a boy with
warm water." Soun turned toward Washu ready to douse the small girl.

	"75 to 80 degrees not 150 to be precise." Washu said in a calm voice 
as she tapped her holographic keyboard.

	"Well then," Soun patted Washu's back hard kettle placed on the
floor, "Your problem's not so bad at all."

	"Nani?" was all Washu could say as Soun pointed toward his daughters.

	"My eldest Kasumi age nineteen,"

	Kasumi smiled and bowed slightly. "Pleased to meet you."

	"My middle daughter Nabiki age seventeen," to which Nabiki showed no
reaction to whatsoever.

	"And finally my youngest daughter, Akane, age sixteen." Soun pointed
as Akane glared again in Washu's direction.

	"Pick the one you want and she's your fiancee." Soun stated as he
finished the re-introduction. Just as the three sisters were about to comment
Washu spoke, "Hold it," She put her hand up and looked Soun Tendo straight
in the eyes. "Soun-dono can we talk for a moment." Washu then looked toward
Genma, "Without any idiotic interruptions."

	"Now hold on a second, this was a pact between Soun and myself,"
Genma shouted, "You have no--" Suddenly Genma was frozen, unmoving, his lips
still open.

	"Much better." Washu grinned wickedly. "Where was I?"

	"You wanted to talk to me about something." Soun said cautiously
stealing a glance at Genma.

	"Right," Washu kneeled down and looked seriously at the Tendo's for
a moment <Washu-chan what are you doing?> Ranma asked worry evident in his
thought. 

	<Something I can't believe I'm going to do> She replied then began
bowing before Soun. "Sumimasen, Soun-dono."

	"Nani?" Soun looked puzzled for a moment.

	"I need a huge favor and I can't offer much in return." Washu said
looking straight at the Tendo clan head. "I need you to take Ranma into your
home--"

	To this Soun smiled, "Well of course, as one of my daughter's 
fiancee Ranma would be more then welcome here."

	"Without the engagement." Washu finished.

	"Without the engagement?" Soun repeated curiously.

	Washu looked sadly at Soun her eye's blurred by moisture.

	"Ranma-dono already has enough problems in his life Soun-dono. 
Because of Genma's constant wanderings to teach him the art Ranma has had no
place to call home till now. He never had the time to make too many friends,
and just when he does make a friend Genma takes off toward another training 
ground with the boy shattering whatever bonds he forms. Then there's the 
fact that he was torn away from his mother at age six and will probably 
never see her again because of a pact Genma stupidly agreed to.

	And now with what has occurred at Jusenkyo I think Ranma is at an
emotional breaking point. While the curse means nothing to me as I can
easily circumvent it's unusual effects. Ranma-dono doesn't have that
ability and I know first hand that he wants to find a cure." Washu then
procedded to turn her head toward the verandah. "I'm also concerned 
about the way Genma has raised Ranma-dono." 

	Soun quirked an eyebrow up at this, "I mean no offense to your old
friend but the man would often sell his son into servitude just to get a
good meal, or use him to pay off a debt that he couldn't pay himself."

	As Washu glanced at the Tendo sisters. Kasumi showed concern and 
saddness in her eyes, Nabiki's mask slipped for a moment as she frowned 
then returned to her cold calculating look, Akane simply was struck by
the intensity of Washu's plea.

	Washu pressed her argument on, "Some of his training methods are also
very careless and have caused Ranma alot of harm, too much in my opinion to
justify the need to make him into a better martial artist."

	"So I ask--beg you again Soun-dono can you take Ranma into your
home without thrusting the engagement onto his shoulders?" Washu wrapped up
looking expectantly at Soun Tendo.

	The man was deep in thought, his eyes were closed, and he repeatedly
scratched his chin. "I'm not so sure..."

	When Soun opened his eyes to look at Washu the small girl was
almost crying. Her eye large and moist with tears. "Please?" she asking in 
a very pitiable voice.

	"eh alright," Soun blurted out which caused the others, Washu
included to smile. "But on one condition." the elder Tendo stated.

	"That being..." Washu asked in a calm detached voice.

	"That when Ranma comes of age he will consider marrying one of my 
girls." Soun stated authoritatively.

	"Daddy." the three sisters said in unison annoyance common in their
tones.

	<Well Ranma-dono what do you think?> Washu thought looking the group
over.

	<Washu-chan,> Ranma thought back with a concern in his voice. 
<Alright I guess it's better then getting engaged right now.>

	"We accept." Washu stated gleefully shaking Soun's hand.

	"Alright then with that settled let's all get some rest." Soun
stated in a fatherly manner, "I think we all deserve it." 

	Soun then patted Washu on the shoulder and headed out of the living
room. The Tendo sister's started to follow when Kasumi pointed to Genma,
"Washu-chan aren't you going to unfreeze Saotome-san?"

	Washu glanced at the slightly overweight man and shook her head. 
"Nah the affects of the beam will wear off in ten hours or so."

	With that Washu headed toward the guest room and setup the futon.
But just as she was about to get to sleep, <Washu-chan,> Ranma slowly said
causing Washu to stop what she was doing.

	<Yes Ranma-dono?> she asked. <Why are you doing all this for me?
and what you said back there did you mean it?> the boy asked quickly his
curiosity about the cute genius peaked by the emotional plea on his behalf.

	<Let's just say I like to foil Genma whereever I can,> Washu started
<plus this place would be an excellent area to re-establish my subspace
laboratory.> Washu laughed aloud and with that settled to sleep under a 
roof for a change.
