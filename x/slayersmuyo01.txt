"UH OH!!" Mike Got Up And Started To Run, He Ran To The Shrine Steps, And Seen the Others Still Sitting There.

Bruce Looked Down And Saw Mike Comming.

"AGG!!"Bruce Got up And Started To Run Up the Stairs, As Did, Vegeta, And Tenchi.

Mike Was Close Behind Them, With Ranko, And Meka In tow.

Eventually, They all Collided In Front Of The Masaki Shrine.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Everyone Screamed, As They Smashed into each other.

"Vegeta, Get Your Foot Outta My Ear" Meka Said, Hitting him

Bruce Was on The Bottom Of the Pile, Along With Tenchi.

While Zelgadis Snoozed On The Limb Of A Tree.

It Had Been  A Few Days of Long hard Travel.

Zel, Lina, And Naga...Where Going To A City To Meet Up With Gourry, Ameila, And Xelloss.

She Noticed That Something Was Glowing Over By The Stream, where They Had Slept.

Lina got up to go And Examine It, and No Sooner had She Moved Was Naga, up And Right Behind her.

Lina knocked on the treen where zel was
"Zel, hey zel" Lina Said.
No Answer
"ZEL!"Lina Said Gettinga little upset.
