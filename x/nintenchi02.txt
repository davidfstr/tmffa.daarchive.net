Nintendo chooses YOU! Pokémon!


Last time on Nintenchi!
Sakuya's lifeforce was released, but her enemy, The Illusionator, wanted revenge 
on Tenchi for "beating" Yugi. An interdimensional rift opened up after her 
defeat, and Jessie and James showed up to cause havoc in the real world! They 
were scared off by Sakuya's Illusion Poke Ball Creation move, and Tenchi and 
Sakuya had their chance to enter the world of Pokemon. But an unexpected visitor 
(yours truly) had other plans...

Nintenchi!

E   +pisode 2
Pika Power!
(or: No Need for an Ultra Ball)


Prologue
(or: No Need for Nintendia)

(Trainer party.)
I had just come out of the interdimensional rift and was at a trainer party in 
the Pokemon world when I saw Jessie and James from Team Rocket setting up to 
play a board game that was a partnership. The partners were red with blue, and 
green with yellow. I went up to them and suggested that they pick red and blue 
to match their hair.  They did, and they eventually won! I saw that the prize 
was all 151 Pokemon, and I went up to them again and offered to use my Pocket 
Pokemon Cloning Machine to clone copies for every member of Team Rocket! I did. 
(Team Rocket Headquarters- Celadon City)
Then I went to Team Rocket Headquarters where Giovanni declared that Team Rocket 
was officially disbanded, si   înce everyone had every Pokemon! 

Suddenly, the door was bashed in! Butch and Cassidy came in and said their 
version of the motto.
"To infect the world with devastation!"
"To blight all peoples in every nation!"
"To denounce the goodness of truth and love!"
"To extend our wrath to the heavens above!"
"Cassidy!"
"Butch!"
"Team Rocket, circling earth all day and night!"
"Surrender to us now or you'll surely lose the fight!"
"Anyway, it appears you've made a slight miscalculation of the Pokemon." said 
Cassidy. 
"It appears you've made a slight miscalculation of the motto!" said Jessie.

Butch and Cassidy were outnumbered. One of the Rockets sent out Electrode to use 
Selfdestruct. And the Electrode went BOOM! "Looks like we're on our own," said 
Butch. "And it also looks like..." "TEAM ROCKET'S BLASTING OFF AGAIN!" (Ding!) 

(The ruins of Ganon's Castle.)
Meanwhile, Link had just defeated Ganon, when suddenly a warp circle like at the 
end of a dungeon sprang up! 
"I... feel a sense of... destiny there...     Go, Link... our ending has been 
interrupted." said Zelda. So Link stepped into the warp, and disappeared into 
the sky...

(The ending platform of Super Mario 64.)
Meanwhile, Mario had just defeated Bowser, when suddenly a pipe sprang up! 
"I... feel a sense of... destiny there... Go, Mario... our ending has been 
interrupted." said Peach. So Mario jumped in the pipe, and glunk glunk glunk, he 
was off...

(The Pokemon League.)
Meanwhile, Ash had just defeated Gary, when suddenly a floor tile turned into a 
war   òp tile! 
"I... feel a sense of... destiny there... Go, Ash... our ending has been 
interrupted." said Professor Oak. So Ash stepped onto the warp tile, and spun 
off...

(back in Team Rocket Headquarters)
Everybody warped to the same place... Team Rocket Headquarters. 
"Ah, everyone's here!" I said. "I would like to propose an alliance! Is that 
okay?"
 "Sure!" said everyone but Link. 
He said "Yes." 
"So, I hereby declare... THE NINTENDIAN ALLIANCE!" As these last words were said 
(by me), everyone started to feel shaking. So did Zelda... and Peach... and 
Prof. Oak... and Tenchi... and Sakuya. In fact everyone in those countries felt 
it, as the countries were joining... literally! In the middle grew a huge tower 
in Nintendia Prime! Now Nintendia includes all N   9intendo games, some books, 
some TV shows (such as Outlaw Star) and D&D, and Tenchi Masaki and Sakuya 
Kumashiro are about to enter in their greatest adventure ever!

Chapter 1
 Pokemon Masters In The Making!
(or: No Need for Separation)
(Celadon City)
Sakuya and Tenchi had just gone through what seemed like the weirdest case of 
continental drift of their lives when I ran up. "Tenchi! Sakuya! Great to see 
you again! I..."
"Hey!" said Tenchi. "You're that kid who kept following me around! You were with 
me when I was going after Yugi..."
(Flashback: Tenchi jumping up all the crystals to get to Yugi. Camera pulls back 
to reveal me jumping up too. We both jump into a big white flash. Warning. 
Incoming dream world. End of flashback.)
"...and at the dream world..."
(Flashback: The dream world of Episode 25. I run up to Te   ›nchi and Sakuya. 
"Anyone want to play Nintendo?" I said. "We don't even know you." said Sakuya. 
"Oh." I said. "I'm Tom. I've got all the versions of Pokemon!" "Oh, COOL! I like 
Pokemon too. My favorite is Elekid." "Curious choice." I said. End of 
flashback.)
"...and at the interdimensional rift!"
(Flashback: Me running into the rift in Tokyo.)
"Yeah, that was me! And now, I RULE ALL NINTENDIA!" I said proudly.
"Nin-WHAT?" said Sakuya.
"Nin-TENDIA! It's all Nintendo games, even the least popular ones like Smash 
TV." I said. "Although I don't really go to that world much."
"And what's weird about Nintendia is, Team Rocket is good..."
"WHAT???" yelled Tenchi. "They're GOOD    ?" "Sure, they got all the Pokemon. 
But there's just one small problem..." I said.
"What might that be?" asked Sakuya.
"Well, remember Butch and Cassidy?" I said.
"The annoying ones with the weird hair?" said Sakuya.
"Yep, that's them! Anyway, due to a slight miscalculation on my part, they did 
NOT get all the Pokemon. They split off from the rest of the group, and joined 
with Bowser and Ganondorf to found the Bad Guys of Nintendia, or BGN." I 
explained.
"So you mean they're still evil, and trying to steal everyone's Pokemon?" said 
Tenchi.
"I'm afraid so." I said.
"Another weird thing is, things that happen in the future reverberate through 
the fabric of space and time..."
"What does that mean?" said Tenchi.
"It means that once I add something to Nintendia, it was there from     the 
start. Although this method is somewhat flawed, as the people still remember 
they came in at a different time, it's just they all get moved back in time." 
(This idea was added to explain how come certain places are in the main 
Nintenchi! series, not in the Nintenchi! Departure series, coming soon, even 
though it's supposed to take place just after the creation of Nintendia.)
"Enough space-time talk. Let's do... umm... what are we here for anyway?" said 
Tenchi.
"I haven't really figured that out yet." I said. (Tenchi and Sakuya fall over. 
Whump.)
"Oh, I know! We could go to Pallet Town and meet Prof. Oak..." said Sakuya.
"... and we could get a Pokemon..." said Tenchi.
"... and you could be trainers! That's a great idea!" I said.
"Let's use...
ILLUSION...
POKE...
BALL...
CREATION!" shouted Sakuya. She pressed her hands together and created a Poke 
Ball.
"Wait a minute!" said Tenchi. "Couldn't you just do that for all 251 and catch 
'em all fast?"
"Unfortunately, this way I can only have one Pokemon at a time    , unlike 
regular Pokemon catching, where you can have six to carry around with you, plus 
many more in your PC." replied Sakuya. "Go! Charizard!"
(Chooingg!)
"CHAR!" roared the Charizard.
"Charizard, Fly to Pallet Town!" shouted Sakuya. We all got on.
Charizard flew up high.

Chapter 2
 Pick a Pokemon!
(or: No Need for Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle)
(Pallet Town)
All three of us flew over Kanto to Pallet Town. The Charizard landed, Sakuya 
recalled it, and the Poke Ball disappeared. Then we went to Prof. Oak    's Lab.
(Prof. Oak's Lab)
"Oh, hello, Tom. Congratulations! But, ehh... who's that with you?" said Prof. 
Oak.
"I'm Tenchi!" said Tenchi.
"And I'm Sakuya." said Sakuya.
"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you." said Prof. Oak.
"So, can we please be trainers?" said Tenchi and Sakuya.
"OK!" said Prof. Oak. "First, you should pick your first Pokemon. Do you want 
the Grass-type Bulbasaur, the Water-type Squirtle, or the Fire-type Charmander?"
"I'll take... Bulbasaur!" said Tenchi.
"And I'll take... Squirtle!" said Sakuya.
"Good choices!" said Prof. Oak. "Oh, by the way, here are your Pokedexes and 
some Poke Balls. You can use these..."
"To catch Pokemon. We know." said Tenchi.
"Oh. Well, good luck." said Prof. Oak. So our happy heroes went off to catch 
some Pokemon. Tr   ouble is, they didn't know where to go, so they just went off 
until they finally got to Viridian City.
(Viridian City)
They saw a Pokemon Center, a Pokemon Mart, and over to one side a big pile of 
rubble.
"What was that?" said Sakuya.
"That was the Gym." I replied.
"How are we going to get our badge?" said Tenchi.
"Woah! You think we're just going to rush right in and get a badge right now?" I 
said. "Besides, this isn't even the first gym. You get the first badge in Pewter 
City, just ahead."
"Oh." said Tenchi.
So we then went into Viridian Forest where Sakuya caught a Pikachu.
"Ooh, it's so CUTE! I think I'll name it Tenchu!"  said Sakuya. (no, not after 
the video game)
"He-he..." grinned Tenchi.
And Tenchi caught a Caterpie.
Then Sakuya beat a trainer in the forest. She was very happy. N    ow she has 
some Pokebucks. Then we came out of the forest and back onto Route 2. But when 
we got to Pewter City we saw two people we never expected to see...

Chapter 3 
Pewter Panic!
(or: No Need for Butch and Cassidy)

(Pewter City)
"Prepare for trouble, 'cause we're here in Pewter!"
"Make it double; not looking for suitors!"
"To infect the world with devastation!"
"To blight all peoples in every nation!"
"To endanger the people of games from Nintendo!"
"This place, Nintendia, we will end-o!"
"Cassidy!"
"But    ch!"
"The BGN, circling earth all day and night!"
"To win against us you have no right!"
"THAT'S BRIGHT!"
It was Butch and Cassidy, ready for their first battle in the BGN.
"Hmm, and who do we have here? I recognize him, he's the Grand Overseer..." said 
Butch. ("For now." he muttered under his breath.) "But who are those?"
"I'm Sakuya!" said Sakuya.
"And I'm Tenchi!" said Tenchi.
"And in the name of Nintendia, we shall punish you!" they said together.
"Ha-ha-ha-ha. Trying to stop us with only level 7 Pokemon." said Cassidy.
Suddenly a voice rang out.
"PIKACHU! GO!" said Ash.
Yes, Ash.
"It's that kid again!" said Butch.
"THUNDERBOLT!" shouted Ash.
Pikachu used Thunderbolt. Butch and Cassidy got shocked.
"Now...
ILLUSION...
SUPER...
FIRE...
ATTACK!" shouted Saku   Tya. She shot a gigantic fire sculpture straight at 
Butch and Cassidy.
It hit them and they went flying.
"She only has level 7 Pokemon..." said Cassidy.
"... but SHE acts like a level 70!" said Butch.
"WE'RE BLASTING OFF AGAIN!" (Ding!)
"Woah!" said Ash. "Well, better get back to Johto. Ball of light mode!"
Ash turned into a ball of red light and flew off.
"Great job, Sakuya." I said. Suddenly, an interdimensional rift appeared!

Chapter 4 
They're BAAaack!
(or: No Need to be Without Friends)

Out of the rift came Sasami, Ryoko, Washu, Ayeka, and Ryo-ohki!
"We've been looking for you all over!" said Washu.
"Meow!" meowed Ryo-ohki.
"You're back!" said Tenchi.    
Everything was fine and dandy, until Ryoko noticed Sakuya.
"AAAH!!! What's she doing here! Tenchi, you get away from that... that SHADOW 
right now!" said Ryoko.
"I have the strangest feeling this is going to be bad." said Tenchi.
"Don't worry. I promise not to hog Tenchi for myself." said Sakuya.
"Phew." said Ryoko.
"...for now." muttered Sakuya.
"What did you say?" said Ryoko.
"Nothing... So what do we do now?" asked Sakuya.
"We go on a little ride." Everyone followed me (the rift closed up) and to a 
stirw    ay leading underground. A sign said, "Torpedopod Station- Pewter City." 
We went down and I went over to a keypad and entered in a unique code. An N64 
Controller-shaped train thingy came up and we all got in. It was a special model 
made for seven. Sasami could hold Ryo-ohki because it's so small. Anyway, we all 
got on, and tracked off to our next destination...
