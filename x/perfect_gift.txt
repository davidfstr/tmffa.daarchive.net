Disclamer: I don't own either Tenchi Muyo or Homeworld. They belong to the fine people at
Pioneer  and Sierra. Don't sue me


"The Perfect Gift"

Ryoko was incredably worried. Tenchi's birthday was only one day away and she had nothing to give him. 
On top of that, she was bored (Tenchi was at school and Mihoshi and Kiyone were on patrol) and really 
pissed off (her fight with Ayeka had not gone well that morning). So she decided to cruise around the 
galaxy for the rest of the day and see if she could blow off some steam.

She and Ryo-ohki had been cruising at full speed for a few hours (along with dodging the occasional GP 
patrol) when they saw the first ship. It was a simple blue with dark blue stribes  scout, based on its size, and 
it seemed to be out of fuel, but Ryoko had never seen a design like it before. It had 4 wings that looked like 
they could fold in against the hull, which was wide near the engines then thined out and widened again until 
it came to the cockpit. Beneath the cockpit were two large chain guns. Just then Ryo-ohki picked up a 
message:

"This is ... elta 5 o ... the Tai ... n Fleet. If an ... ne can he .. me, I n.. ed assis...ce. Mayday
Ma....ay."

"What do you think Ryo-ohki, should we help him?" Ryoko asked. Ryo-ohki meowed an affirmative.

"Alright then, let's help. Maybe there'll be something in it for us"

Ryo-ohki moved forward, and slowly the message became clearer. Ryoko sent her own message a few 
moments later: " Hey, want some help?" Ryoko asked sarcastically, "I think I can push you in the right
direction."

"Thanks, I need to get back to my fleet," the pilot responded, "I'll transmit the coordinates to your ship"

"So where exactly am I taking you?" Ryoko inquired after looking over the data.

"The Taiidan Mothership," (author's note: In Homeworld you can either play as the Taiidan or the
Kushan. I chose Taiidan because their ships look better)

"What?!"

"You'll know it when you see it."
*******************************************************************************

That, in fact, was true, for it was one of the largest starships Ryoko had ever seen. It was also blue with
blue stripes (as was the rest of the fleet as far as she could see). It was rectangular with three points coming 
out at the front around two of the hangars (there were 3 hangars total, 2 on the front and one on the bottom)
and had the full fleet arranged in front of it in a military parade formation. When Ryoko was close enough 
to start getting sensor data, a female voice began sending a message on all channels:
"Attention unidentified vessel, this is Fleet Command please state your bussiness and explain why you are 
pushing one of our fighters."

"This is Ryoko, pilot of Ryo-ohki (Ryo-ohki meowed a protest to this statement), I came across this scout of 
yours while I was flying around, he looked pretty beat up, so I helped him back." Ryoko stated smugly.

Fleet Command seemed slightly stunned at this. "Activating scanners for confirmation, one moment please."

Ryoko waited impatiently for the scans to finish, even though they only took a few seconds, and was quite 
glad to learn that the ship had been reported as a loss when the rest of his squad had been destroyed and that 
the recon data that command had recieved was invalulabe. Ryoko grinned to herself thinking that she had 
just made some easy money when the attack came.
*******************************************************************************

All Ryoko heard before the explosion rocked her ship was "Kushans, incoming!" She had not been ready 
for a fight and was subsequently thrown across the inside of Ryo-ohki. Groaning as she got up, she glanced  
outside to see what was happening. Dozens of fighters and corvettes, which had been identified as 
"Kushans" were darting from ship to ship, destroying scouts and taking pot shots at the capital ships. The 
Mothership didn't seem to be harmed yet, a plus if Ryoko was going to get her reward, but the fleet itself 
seemed to be as unprepared for the attack as Ryoko was. Flying to the ship's controls, Ryoko cursed herself 
for not being ready and fired on the first Kushan ship that came into range. She scored a direct hit and the 
interceptor's engines ripped free of the rest of the chassis, which promptly exploded. Smiling to herself, 
Ryoko decided that this wouldn't be completely worthless, at least she wouldn't be angry when Tenchi got 
home.

The battle continued like this for about three minutes. Then the Kushan capital ships came to play. By this 
time, Fleet Command had sent Ryoko a sensors list, so she would at least know what she was shooting at, 
and Ryoko knew that the incoming ships were Destroyers and Ion Cannon Frigates accompanied by a 
Carrier. Just then Ryoko recieved another message from Fleet Command:

"Ryoko, that beam of yours seems incredably powerful and we won't be able to last much longer if that 
Carrier sends out more fighters, our other ships are busy and you will be greatly rewarded if you destroy it."

At the word "reward" all of Ryoko's objections instantly melted away. In the chaos of the battle she slipped 
behind the enemy Carrier and fired a shot at full power into the engines. At first nothing seemed to happen, 
but as Ryoko charged up her next shot, sparks began to come out of several of the exhaust ports. Firing 
again, she was pleased to see a much more immediate effect, jets of flame began to shoot out all across the 
ship, and one engine was missing. As her final shot slammed into the Carriers hull, It began to tear apart, 
and a large sphere of pure energy ripped out of what was once the central reactor, the force of it ripped the 
ship's remains to a molecular size. Stunned at the loss of their flagship, the remaing capital ships entered 
hyperspace, leaving the fighters to the mercy of the Taiidans. Ryoko began to cheer as the remaining 
fighters were torn into scrap metal.
****************************************************************************

Once the Taiidans had finished salvaging what they could and mopping up the remaining fighters, Fleet 
Command sent another message to Ryoko:

"Ryoko, I must admit that we are in your debt ( Ryoko began to smile once again at those words) and if 
there is anything we can do to assist you in anyway, just name it."

Ryoko began to smile even wider. "Well, there is this one thing you can do for me..."
****************************************************************************

The next day, Tenchi found a Taiidan Scout, without the guns, sitting in front of the house.
