Disclaimer: This is a contest between Komobito (a fellow TMFFA writer) and 
myself.  We are making a similar story, and we hope you (the reader) will give 
us your input on who's version is the best.  Gundam is a trademark of Sunrise, 
while Tenchi Muyo TV (Universe) is a treademark of AIC.  I do not own any of 
these franchises, but because I do this for free... IT SHOULD BE NO CONCERN TO 
THOSE AFFILIATED WITH THEM!! NOW you Kick back and relax...

"Hey butch, what the hell is this thing?," asked Brute.

"Don't touch that damn it!," flamed Butch. "It's the brand new MSN-05 
Nightingale II Prototype.  An ehannced version of of the MSN-04 Nightingale 
which uses a beta time traveling device."

"Time travel? How much whiskey have you consumed in the past 24 hours? Don't you 
know, over a thousand of years ago, the world's smartest man, Steve Hawking, 
made a ground breaking theory that time travel was impossible?," claimed Brute.

"Those with high IQs are mindless idiots without a clue," sternly responded 
Butch.

Brute smirked; "Really? I think I'm going to check it out..."

"You can't!," yelled Butch. "Admirial Char said he wanted to be the one to test 
it!"

"You know what I say? FUCK HIM!!," growled Brute.

"Stay away from that God damn it!," yelled a now angered Butch. "That is a 
direct order Enson!"

Brute gives Butch the middle finger; "Whatever you say asshole!" He then opens 
the cockpit door.

"That's it, I'm coming up there..." Butch climbs a ladder so he can get to the 
cockpit.

"I think I'll set the date to exactly 1,200 years ago," said Brute with a 
sinister smile on his face.

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"

A giant void engulfs Lt. Akerfelt, Enson Azagthoth, and the MSN-05 Nightingale 
II...

"Damn you Enson!"

"Ah come on boss, how was I supposed to know that time travel was possible?"

"Brute, you are an bloody idiot!" How in the hell are we supposed to get back 
home? That was just a beta version, the time travel device hasn't been set to 
send people to the future yet!"

"Oops."

"Oops? Here ee are stranded, in the past, in the middle of no where, and all you 
can bloody say is Oops?! GOD DAMN IT ENSON, I WISH YOU WERE NEVER CONCEIVED!!"

"Excuse me, but who are you?," asked a teenage oriental male.

"I AM A MILITARY OFFICER, SO WHO IN THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU SCUMBAG?!," yelled a 
demanding Butch.

"Yo man, what year is it?," asked Brute.

"Um, 1996," replied the young man.

"HOLY SHIT, WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT BACK!!," yelled a stressed out Butch.

"Well, Mr?"

"Tenchi Masaki"

"Well Mr. Masaki, you don't know anyone that excels in the area of time travel, 
do you?," asked Brute.

Tenchi sighs, "I do, kind of..."

"This person must be a brilliant scienctist," implied Brute.

"She is a little crazy, but I'm sure she could help you," claimed Tenchi.

"She? Is she HOT?!" asked Brute.

"GOD DAMN IT ENSON!! THIS IS A CRITICAL CRISIS, AND ALL YOU CAN BLOODY THINK OF 
IS PICKING UP WOMEN?," yelled the enraged Butch.

Tenchi thought to himself; *What a bunch of cooks...* "Well, perhaps we should 
go inside."

"Great idea. By the way, do you have any sisters? Do you think they'd be 
interested in a guy in uniform?"

"SHUT THE HELL UP GOD DAMN IT!!"

"My bad Butch.  Do you have two sister that would be interested in a double date 
with us?"

"Trust me, the woman in my house would kill you," replied Tenchi.

Brute smirked; "Goody, I can't wait to meet 'em!"

"I HATE YOU!!"

"Nah, you'll love once we get ourselves some," said the egotistical Brute.

*God, please don't let Ayeka and Ryoko be home when we get there,* Tenchi 
thought to himself.

Scene cuts to Tenchi and the two Zeon members walking through the back door...

"Ohayo Tenchi," said the adorable Sasami. "Who are they?"

"Military Officers from who knows where...," responded Tenchi.

"TENCHI!!"

*Oh no, it's Ryoko!* Tenchi thought as he received a cold chill down his 
spine...

"HEY BABY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON WITH YOU?! SAY, ARE YOU SINGLE? BECAUSE IF YOU'RE 
NOT, WE CAN ALWAYS GO STEADY"!!, Brute blurted out.

*He's dead!,* thought Tenchi.

"WHAT DID YOU SAY?!!", growled Ryoko.

Brute abruptly replied; "Nothing at all".

"What on Earth is going on in here"? Another female has entered the room.  She 
has lavender hair, red eyes, and a nasty attitude problem.

"HEY HOTTY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WANNA GET MARRIED"?!, blurted Brute, yet again.

Tenchi gulped as a large veins boiled on Ayeka's forehead...

"Azaka! Kamidake! Apprehend this vile scum"!, screamed the psychopathic 
princess.

Azaka and Kamidake appear out of nowhere and shock the living crap out of 
Brute...

Butch, who was now in tears because of his misfortune, shouted; "You bloody 
deserved it, you son of a bitch"!

Meanwhile in the land of Eternal Damnation...

"Lord Beelzebub, the military is in position to attack the region where 
Scientist Washu is believed to be".

"Well done commander", said Beelzebub with an evil grin. "We will attack at 
18:00 hours GMT".

Now we go to Tenchi's room. The thought of more guest made Tenchi VERY 
depressed. Unfortunetly, Tenchi only has one thing in the world that gives him 
comfort. It is his music that does so. Tenchi drownded himself into Slayer's 
album 'Reign in Blood'.

"Raining Blood"

Trapped in purgatory
A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquisition

The sky is turning red
Return to power draws near
Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears
Abolish the rules made of stone

Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past
Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above

Awaiting the hour of reprisal
Your time slips away

Raining blood
>From a lacerated sky
Bleeding its horror
Creating my structure
Now I shall reign in blood!

"What is the point of my life"? Tenchi asked himself. "Ever since those females 
showed up, my life has brought me nothing but torment. Maybe it's time I run 
away. Perhaps I'll use my life savings to settle down in Tokyo, where I will 
never again be bothered. Brilliant, I don't know why I didn't think of it 
sooner!"

Tenchi stuffed a breifcase with personal belongings and snuck out the front 
door...
