This is the standard disclaimer that all fanfics get. The characters

This is all for non-profit reasons, so please don't sue me. I don't 
have enough to make it worth while anyway. And now on with the story. 

Note: I know Ranma is acting out of character. The reasons why will 
be explained in memories and flashbacks throughout the story. Also, 
in this story I'm throwing all of the Inner Senshi into Juuban high.   
They are all the same age as Ranma, about 17.  Tomas is 19, but has 
been out of school since his parents' death, about two years, so he 
is in the same grade as Ranma.  I'm also making Hotaru 15 in this, 
but she goes to a different school.  This is an alternate Sailor Moon 
universe, bet the changes are pretty much in age.  In the Ranma Time-line 
it is about 14 months after the bombed wedding.  For the Sailor Moon 
universe this is somewhere between Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SS.  
For the Tenchi Universe this happens after the second movie.  Washu has 
aged Mayuka to 14 years.  This is NOT an SI fic.

Chapter 4
Part A
Race to the Masaki Residence

	The sun had just set in the west.  The sky held a faint 
tint of red but no more of the beautiful sunset that had just 
closed the day.  In front of a long set of stairs a public bus 
came to a stop.  After a few moments with the doors open a battered 
figure stepped off.  A moment later a taller figure in an even worse
state than the first got off.  The two figures stood there even after 
the bus left.  Finally the taller one spoke.

	"Well, looks like we made it.  Think they were able to follow 
us here?"

	"No chance.  There is no way they could have known what bus 
we got on or where we are going.  We're finally safe."

	A third voice then interrupted them.  "I hate to disappoint 
you boys, but you're not safe yet."

	Tomas and Ranma looked at each other.  Neither of them could 
come up with something to say.  Finally Ranma said what was on both 
their minds.  "No way.  No way in hell."

	The two slowly turned around and looked at who was behind them.  
There, in all their skimpy outfit glory where the Inner Senshi.  The 
one in the middle spoke.  "For hurting our friends and endangering 
civilians in your rampage, in the name of the moon, I will punish you!"

	Tomas blinked a couple of times before turning to Ranma.  
"Have you got anything left?  I'm all out."  Ranma shook his head ever 
so slightly.  "Well, then I guess we have no choice."

	"None at all.  Allow me the honor."  Ranma and Tomas shifted 
into their respective stances.  Then Ranma called out the move.  "SAOTOME 
SCHOOL OF ANYTHING GOES MARTIAL ARTS FINAL TECHNIQUE: RUN AWAY!"  With 
that the two young me turned and bolted into the woods at an incredible speed.

	It took the Senshi another minuet to realize what had happened 
and give chase.

*************************************************************************************

	All the way back in the Juuban district the Outer Senshi were 
resting in their home after their disastrous run in with the two martial 
artists.  Hotaru, a.k.a. Sailor Saturn, had healed the majority of their 
wounds when she arrived at the scene of the fight, but the effort of it 
weakened her so much that she couldn't go with the other Senshi.  She had 
just woken up from a deep sleep and went to join the others in the living 
room.


	"Hello Michiru-mama, Haruka-papa.  Are you okay now?"   The 
Senshi of Neptune and Uranus looked up at the sound of her voice and 
smiled at her.  They could both hear the worry in her voice and wanted 
to reassure her that they were indeed all right.

	Haruka spoke up first.  "We're just fine Hotaru.  You healed us 
very well.  Thank you."

	"Yes, we were more worried about you than about ourselves.  It 
must have taken a lot to heal the three of us from those burns."  Michiru 
gave another smile to Hotaru.

	"What happened on that roof?  What hurt you so bad?  Was I a 
youma?"  <Whatever hurt mama and papa and Pluto had to be strong.  I 
don't want to come up against it alone.>

	"Not exactly, Hotaru-chan.  There was a youma today, but we 
didn't fight it.  Pluto detected two people who were disrupting the time 
stream.  We went to stop them but they got the hand on us.  When we tried 
to talk to them they attacked us.  It caught us completely by surprise."  
Michiru gave Haruka a questioning glance but didn't say anything.  It was 
returned with a 'play along' look.  Hotaru missed them both.  "They were 
both very injured, and didn't look like they would be able to even walk 
without each other's help.  The taller of the two made a few smart remarks 
and created those flames under us."  

Michiru picked up the story.  "I'm glad you weren't there Hotaru-chan.  
If you had been caught in those flames too, Usagi would have had to use 
the Imperial Crystal to cure us all, and then she wouldn't have been able 
to go with the others after them."  

Haruka looked at the clock and saw that it was getting close to dinnertime.  
She told Hotaru to go and get cleaned up for dinner while she and Michiru 
finished the cooking.  After Hotaru left the room, she turned to talk to 
her lover.  "I'm sure your wondering why I told her that."

	"Yes, I am.  There was no reason to lie like that."

	Haruka sighed.  "She is to young to understand why we did what 
we did.  She would think of us as cold heartless people.  This way, not 
only do we get her aid undisputed when we go after them again, but we 
don't have to worry about her having a moral crisis in the middle of a 
fight.  What she doesn't know won't hurt her."

	Michiru was quiet for a few moments before finally speaking.  "I 
don't like having to lie to her.  It's not right.  But I can see the point 
this time.  Pluto did say that the threat to the time stream must be destroyed.  
We can't let her know what happened.  She might rebel against us if we did, and 
that would break my heart.  I'll go along with you on this."

	"Thanks, Michiru-chan."  They were silent for a few minutes, and then 
Hotaru came back.    They all sat down and enjoyed a quiet dinner.

***************************************************************************************

	Ranma and Tomas dodged through the trees.  They knew that they wouldn't 
be able to get away from the girls chasing them.  The fact that they were 
running from girls really hurt Ranma's overly large ego.  He was sending 
silent curses to the Kami about how unfair life was when a reply was sent.  
It came in the form of Sailor Mercury.

	"SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!"

	A stream of ice cold water slammed into Ranma's back, activating his 
curse and propelling her forward.  She kept going up until he slammed into a 
tree.  The force of the blast caused the tree to fall over.  A few seconds 
later and Tomas was there pulling him out of the tree and carrying him, now 
her, in a fireman's carry.  As Ranma regained her senses, Tomas spied something 
ahead.  He came to a quick decision and raced toward it.  He quickly outlined 
his plan to Ranma, who was in too much pain at the moment to do anything but agree.

	Tomas, still carrying Ranma, stepped out of the woods and onto the shore 
of a lake.  "Just remember, Ranma, act like someone totally different.  If they 
ask you which way I went, tell them the truth.  I'll try to double back in about 
five minuets.  You had better have some traps set up.  I don't want a fight right 
now."  Before Ranma could respond, Tomas through her into the lake.  He was back 
into the woods before Ranma hit the water.

	Under water, Ranma pulled off her shirt to try to keep the Senshi from 
recognizing her as the boy they had been chasing.  Just as she brought her head 
up, the Senshi came out of the woods.  Ranma let out a scream, and tried to cover 
her chest.  "Perverts!  Where did they go!  I'll kill them for seeing me naked 
like that!"  She preyed that the Sailor Senshi bought it.

	Large sweat drops formed over the Senshi's heads.  After a quick look at 
the topless girl ranting in the water, Sailor Jupiter spoke up.  "We're after 
those two, also.  If you will shows us where they went, we promise to make them 
pay for this."

	Ranma looked up and acted like this was the first time he noticed them.  
After blinking a couple of times, she dropped back into the water.  She then pointed 
in the general direction that Tomas went and told them so.  They thanked her and 
took off back into the woods.  After She was sure that they where gone, She pulled 
her shirt on and got out of the lake.  <Now, to try to make those traps Tom wanted.  
It shouldn't be too hard.>

	All of a sudden a voice spoke behind him.  "Maybe you want to tell me just 
what is going on, huh?"  Ranma turned around and saw a very attractive girl with 
Cyan colored hair floating behind him.

	<GULP!>

*************************************************************************************************

	"Hmm, that's strange.  Some massive powers just entered the Masaki grounds. 
 I wonder what it could be.  I think I had better find out.  The five of them could 
cause trouble."

	Washu was in her sub-space lab when the sensors informed her of the intruders.  
There were five of them, all heading in the same direction and close to each other.  
Living at the Masaki house one learned not to take intruders lightly.  Just then, as 
Ryouko floated through the wall of the lab, her sensors picked up two weaker power 
sources in front of the first five

"Looks like those two are being chased, and headed right for the lake.  This should 
be interesting."  A new gleam entered her eyes.  She couldn't wait to find out what 
the first two did to get the other five to chase them.  "But I'll find out, because 
I am the greatest scientific genus in the universe.  HAHAHAHAHA!!"

Ryouko decided that this was a good time to butt in and made herself know.  "Hey, Washu, 
dinner's ready.  You going to join us or should I tell Sasami to make a plate for you?"

	"Ryouko just the demoness I wanted to see.  There's a fun little chase going on 
out in the woods.  Its heading straight for the lake.  I want you to go and check it out.  
Try to get one of them to talk to you about it.  It should be interesting."

	"Why should I do anything for you?  What am I gonna get out of it?"" Ryouko saw 
the gleam in Washu's eyes and decided to get what ever she could out of it.

	"Fine, I promise not to experiment on you for two weeks.  Is that good enough 
for you?"  <Of course I haven't said when those two weeks will be.>

	Ryouko thought for a moment and realized that this was the best deal that she 
would probably get, and agreed.  After getting where the chase was heading, she 
teleported to the lake.  She got there just in time to see Ranma land in the water and 
Tomas enter the woods.  She watched the scene with the Senshi unfold.  While Ranma was 
busy putting on a show, one thought was going through Ryouko's mind.  <They better not 
try to take my Tenchi!>

	After the girls in short skirts left, Ryouko decided to talk to the red head 
who was coming out of the water.  She teleported to a spot behind her, and about eight 
feet in the air.  "Maybe you want to tell me just what is going on, huh?"  The young 
redhead turned around slowly and looked up at her.  Ryouko could see the nervousness 
in the girl.  "Well, I'm waiting."  The girl's eyes were flickering around, most likely 
trying to find a way to escape.  Ryouko got annoyed and chose to ruff the girl up a 
bit.  She teleported down to the ground and picked the stranger up by the shirt.  
"You're going to answer me now, or else there are going to be problems."  So saying, 
her energy blade appeared in her free hand.

	At that point Ranma's nerves broke and her words flowed in a rush.  "Me and 
my friend are on the way to my grandfather's house.  We were attacked and bolted 
into the woods.  I'm tellin' you we didn't me to tress pass.  Please, please you've 
got to put me down!  Tomas will be back in a few minutes and I've got to get things 
set up!  Let go of me!"  

At the grandfather comment Ryouko raised an eyebrow.  <I wonder who she means?  
The only home up here is Yousho's.  Maybe…>  "Alright, girl, whose your Grandfather?  
Tell me or else?"

"Katsuhito Masaki!  His name is Katsuhito Masaki!  I'm Ranma Saotome."  With 
those words Ryouko dropped Ranma and stared at her.  After a moment she decides 
to speak up.

	"I'm Ryouko.  I'm living at the Masaki home.  I'll go let Katsuhito 
know you're here and get you some help.  Stay in this area.  This is where I'll 
lead everyone.  Try not to get killed in the meantime."  Ryouko then teleported 
to the dinning room.  <If I let Tenchi know that his cousin is being attacked and 
needs help, its sure to go in my favor.  I'll be up on that spoiled brat Aeka.>

	She materialized right above the table.  Before anyone could say anything 
she quickly told them what she had learned.  Tenchi's reaction was of surprise to 
say the least.

	"I have a cousin?  Grandfather why didn't you ever tell me?"

	"Nodaka and I didn't part on the best of terms.  That's not important right 
now, though.  If it is Nodaka's child out there, then we must help.  It is, after 
all, a family member."

	"Right.  Aeka, Kiyone, Ryouko, lets go.  We have to get there fast."

	Ryouko was the first to react.  "I'll teleport ahead.  Will head toward the 
house, so try to set up an ambush between the lake and here."  So saying she immediately 
went back to the lake where a new figure was arguing with Ranma.

**********************************************************************************************

	"What do you mean there aren't any traps set up?!  How the hell are we 
suppose to get them off our backs then?!  I try to throw anything and I'll probably 
keel over."  It was at that point Tomas saw Ranma pointing.  He turned, expecting to 
see the Sailor brats.  What he saw, instead, caused him to perform a nice looking 
facefault.

	Ranma took the opportunity to speak up.  "We're supposed to get away from 
them with help like that.  Are they coming, ah, um, I forgot your name."

	"Its Ryouko."  She landed by them as Tomas finally picked himself off of the 
ground.  "And no they're not coming.  They're setting up an ambush up ahead.  Come on, 
We don't want to disappoint them."  She turned to head into the woods when Tomas grabbed 
her arm.

	"You and Ranma stay behind me.  They'll think that your chasing me, too.  Stop 
after a few meter and pretend to be out of breath.  Let them go by you then follow from 
behind.  We can then catch them on all four sides."

	"Sounds good.  Just head straight that way."  Tomas took off into the woods.  
A few seconds later Ranma and Ryouko went after him.    After a minute of running 
through the woods both Ryouko and Ranma stopped, pretending to be out of breath.  It 
didn't take long for the Senshi to catch up to them.

	Sailor Moon saw the two girls huffing and spoke to them.  "Are you alright?  
They didn't hurt you did they?"  She sounded concerned for them.

	As Ranma contemplated this Ryouko took the initiative.  "No they didn't,  
(Huff….Puff) but we … we couldn't … keep up.  Please say that … you will get them?"

	"Of course we will!  We are the Sailor Senshi and have never loss.  Don't worry 
we'll make them pay for whatever they did to you.  Lets go girls!"  The other Senshi, 
who had been using the time to catch their breath, took off with their leader.

	After they were gone Ranma looked at Ryouko.  "Well, that was easy."

	"Lets just hope that the others are in place.  Come on, I don't want to miss 
the fun!"  The two of them followed the Senshi toward the ambush.


	Tomas raced through the woods.  As the trees and bushes whipped by him, his eyes 
sought out the ambush.  <If I'm lucky, they'll give me some warning before the trap is 
sprung.  If I'm not, well, better not think about that.>  All of a sudden some movement 
caught his eye.  As he stared a head he could make out a young man waving him forward.  
Guessing that this was one of the people Ryouko said would help, he sprinted a bit faster, 
eventually stopping behind the tree.  Looking at the young man, who bore a resemblance to 
Ranma, Tomas opened his mouth.  "So, you are?"

	"I'm Tenchi Masaki.  I live here at the shrine.  Who are you?"

	"The names Tomas.  I'm Ranma's friend.  Listen, these people are tough.  
I hope you know what your getting into."

	"I have the Tenchi-ken."  Tenchi held up the hilt of Yousho's sword to show 
to Tomas.  'I'll be fine.  The others are about ten meters away on either side of the 
path.  We'll catch them in a cross fire and drive them off.  Don't worry, what can go 
wrong."  Tomas looked at him for a few seconds before turning back to the path.  Moments 
later the sound of feet against hard packed dirt was ringing through the woods.

	Tomas grabbed Tenchi's arm and yanked him into view of the trail.  "We've got 
to get them to stop.  I want Ranma to have time to catch them from behind.  You look 
enough like him that in the dark they might mistake you for him.  Just keep that sword 
of yours  loose."  Tenchi looked at him questionably, but it was too late.  The Senshi 
had arrived and started spitting speeches at the two of them.  Tomas rolled his eyes 
and waited for them to stop, while Tenchi looked at them like they were nuts.  When 
the long winded speeches were finally over Tomas spoke up again.  "I have only one 
thing to say to you."

Mars gave him one of her looks of death and asked him what it was.

	"Suckers."

	Then the fun started.  Aeka, Kiyone, and Ryouko fired at them from the sides 
and the rear.  Tenchi, Ranma, and Tomas moved in to start a general melee.  Within the 
first two minutes of the "fight" Sailors Moon and Mercury were taken out, unconscious 
and battered.  The remaining three Senshi decided that it was time to leave.  As Mars 
moved to pick up Sailor Moon, she noticed that she had a clear shot at Aeka's back.  
<I better take it.  If I take her out now, I won't have to deal with her later.>  She 
fired off one of her Mars Fire Bird attacks.  Tomas, who had been catching a quick 
breather off to one side, noticed this, and placed himself between the attack and its 
intended target.  At the sound of the explosion, Aeka turned around.  Even before she 
had the time to back away from the intense heat, the raging fires condensed inward and 
disappeared.  The only thing left was Tomas, who was smirking at the red Senshi's back.

	"Care to try that again, little girl."  He mustered the most insulting tone 
that he could.  At the sound of his voice, Sailor Mars turned looked over her shoulder 
and stopped.  Not only was he unharmed, but he looked even better than before.  "  You 
do know that fire can't hurt a Phoenix, right?"  

Mars just took off after Jupiter, who was carrying Sailor Moon away from the fight. 

After she was gone, Tomas turned around to address the purple hair girl behind him.  
"Guess what, I lied."  So saying he collapsed at Aeka's feet.
