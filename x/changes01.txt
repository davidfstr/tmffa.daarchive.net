This is a Ranma 1/2 /Tenchi crossover.
I don't own Ranma (or any characters) or Tenchi (or any characters). I'm not 
making money off of this, so there's no reason to sue me. 
Changes
Chapter one: And it begins

On a sunny day in summer, Ranma walks up the stairs to the Tendo household. 
Ranma goes to knock on the door, but is stopped by the sight of this cousin, 
Tenchi.
	"Hello Tenchi, I'm here to give you that long needed rest." Said Ranma. 
	"What?" Said Tenchi.
	"Yosho called me yesterday and said you need a long rest. So I said that I 
would take you with me I have some business and after that we can have some 
fun." 
	"Well who will take care of the carrot patch?"	
	"I'll do it. You'll have time to think without Ryoko or Aeka. " Said 
Yosho. 
	"Okay, I'll go with you." Said Tenchi.	 
Tenchi took about ten minutes to get this stuff together and packed. Ranma and 
himself took the bus to the port and got onto a boat heading for a remote 
section of China. When Ranma and Tenchi reach China, they rented a jeep. 
"So Ranma were are we going?" said Tenchi.
	"Have you ever heard of the cursed springs in china?" said Ranma.
"No." said Tenchi as spaced out
"They say if you fall in to one of the springs you are cursed, when you are 
splashed with cold water you change into what ever drown there last. And when 
splashed with hot water you change back." Said Ranma.
"So why are we going there, anyway?" asked Tenchi.
"A friends owes me money." He had the answer planed out ahead of time. Living 
with Akane that did that to him.
"Okay." Said Tenchi 
Tenchi and Ranma, after about ten minutes of sit in silence, started talking 
about life, women, and just things in general.

When they reached Juesenkeyo:
	"Tenchi why don't you take a tour." Said Ranma as he walked to a 
tourguide.
Tenchi, as Tenchi walked to a different tourguide.
	"Can I get a tour a round this place?" asked Tenchi.
	"Of course." answered the tourguide.  
"How much do I owe you?" asked Tenchi 
"I'll cover it Tenchi." answered Ranma 
 "Okay." answered Tenchi
Tenchi and the tourguide took off on the tour. 
	" How much is it, now?" asked an annoyed Ranma at the answer he knew was 
coming.
"3,000,000,000,000,000,000 yen" answered the greedy tourguide.
"You known I can't pay that."  answered an angry Ranma 
" Okay I'll make you a deal, if you can dodge my squirtgun shots until your 
friend gets out of here. Then I'll let you have the stuff." responded the greedy 
tourguide
"Okay" said Ranma with a grin.
	*			*			*
As Tenchi walked along the path and listen to the tourguide, he started to think 
about Washu and the rest of the girls. 
	"I'd bet Washu would like a sample of this water." thought Tenchi bending 
over one of the springs getting a closer look. Just as he bent down a small 
child came running by flailing his arms and knocking Tenchi in.
	"Hey you little..."shouted Tenchi-chan suddenly noticing her voice, 
without looking felt her chest. Instead of his pecks she found, two large 
breasts. Tenchi not believing that ether she stuck her hand down her pants, 
trying to bring herself out of this twisted daymare. Groping for anything, but 
to no prevail he only found a slit. Just then the tourguide saved himself 
falling into one of the springs. When the tourguide hoped down off a pole that 
was protruding from the middle a spring.
 	"I was almost a panda, there." laughed the tourguide, then he noticed 
Tenchi's state.
He ran over to Tenchi as she climbed out of the springs and took something out 
of his pocket.
	"Hey what happened to me?" asked Tenchi-chan.
Just then the tourguide popped the cork of the canteen and poured the contents 
over her head. 
	"What will... Hia I'm back to normal. Just to make sure." He said as he 
stuck his hand down his pants. "I'm back."
	"What for the curse to be cured to celebrate." said the tourguide; he then 
explained the curse. "So an questions?"
	"How did you know I would fall in?" pondered Tenchi
	"I didn't. It's part of the equipment now that people are even more 
clumsier, now a days." explained the tourguide.
"So are you cursed too?" asked Tenchi as they walked back to meet Ranma.
"No, but many of the tourguides here are, though." Said the tourguide
  When they came up on Ranma and the other tourguide fighting they were con 
fused. Ranma was running and bouncing off poles dodging ever shot. Just then 
Ranma jumped on top of the tourguide's head, smashing the cap over his eyes 
making shoot everywhere.
	"Ranma, what are you doing?" he cried from the top of a pole(he dodged the 
cold water shot)
	"Tenchi run through the gates over there." yelled Ranma jumping off his 
spot
Tenchi started to run, but the tourguide had the hat off his face seconds before 
Tenchi could get two feet. The tourguide shot the ground turning to mud as 
Tenchi ran; he slipped in it. The tourguide seeing his opening and shot at Ranma 
hitting him square in the face. That caused him to change just as Tenchi rolled 
over to see what had happened. Tenchi's face faulted as he saw his cousin change 
in to a girl. To celebrate the tourguide shot into he air, causing it to ran 
down. This went on till Ranma and the tourguide noticed Tenchi changed, also.
	"It'll be alright you'll get used to it." he said with a frown
"You lost." laughed the tourguide, Ranma snuck up behind him. With one punch 
Ranma sent him into a near by spring. Then Ranma and Tenchi left talking about 
new things. 
	*			*				* 
That weekend Ranma and Tenchi had the best long weekend ever. They spared, 
watched movies till morning, Tenchi fought Kuno (Tenchi beat him with a regular 
sword). Though he didn't want to, Tenchi was ready to go on Tuesday. Genma gave 
Tenchi some bus money (that morning Ranma and Akane started fighting over 
something, so Ranma was being chased by her.).
