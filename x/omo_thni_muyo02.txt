{She puts her hand over him and a warm light came out surrounding Othni. 
Then, the fiber went out.} There. and thanks. {Then she stands and warp 
the cover on Othni. After that, she goes outside leaving him behind.

Kid goes outside and receive the warm good morning of a sunny day. Then 
she goes to the house but Othni's brother wasn't there either. Not 
knowing what to do, she found a broom and starts cleaning the pathways 
toward the temple. Two hours passed and Othni didn't woke up. He still
