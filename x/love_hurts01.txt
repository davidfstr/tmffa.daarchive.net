Love Hurts- Part 1: "Open Portalsesame!"

          by Kokoiny ^.^



  It was a beautiful day. Tenchi and the gang- except Kyione, who was
sleeping the whole day out- were sitting on the grass, enjoying a
picnic of sandwiches, punch, pie, and fruit. Sasami made all this of
course.
  "Ah! This is the life!" Ryoko said as she lay on the grass, a piece
of grass in her mouth.
  "I must agree Ryoko." Ayeka said as she lay on the grass too. She
plucked a long piece of grass and stuck it in her mouth. Just then,
her face turned purple and she spit the grass and grass spit out into
the lake.
  "Are you ok Ayeka?" Sasami asked as she gave Ryo-ohki a carrot.
  "Yes, yes. Quite fine." Ayeka replied.
  "Washu," Tenchi said. He startled everyone after being quite for so
long.
  "Call me Little Washu!" Washu replied smiling and putting her two
index fingers on her cheek.
  Tenchi, Mihoshi, Ryoko, Sasami, and Ryo-ohki all groaned.
  "Little Washu," Tenchi said with slit eyes of annoyment. "Do you
think that we may have another enemy again?"
  "Of course my Tenchi dear. You are the prince of Jurai." Washu said
as slapped Mihoshi's hand which was about to take Washu's watermelon.
  "I'm still hungry!" Mihoshi cried as she rubbed her hand.
  "I'll go cut up some more watermelons for you Mihoshi!" Sasami said
as she and Mihoshi walked inside. The hungry cabbit hopped behind them.
  "How do you know anyway?!" Tenchi demanded with his slit eyes.
  "I'm a genius. The genius of the galaxy! No, the universe!"
Washu said as she laughed to herself. Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko were
not impressed.
  "Oh well. So are you working on anything damn Washu?" Ryoko said as
she gobbled up a big piece of pie.
  "Call me Little Washu! And that's no way to talk to your mother!"
Washu said. She was jolly one minute, and then annoyed the other.
  "Well, are you?" Mihoshi asked as she, Sasami, and Ryo-ohki came back
outside with a plate full of watermelon slices.
  "Yes. I'm working on a "Portala 10,000." Washi replied with closed
eyes as everyone blinked.
  "What's that? Sound french. Merci, bonjou-" Ayeka asked.
  "Shut up Ayeka." Ryoko said.
  "In short terms, a portal. I made the name up. Anyways, it's supposed
to let us go into other worlds, but they can't come here. We can just
go into their world, but we are invisible to them. We can only see us."
Washu explained and interrupted like a Not-Washu.
  "Oooooooooh! Cool! When can we try it out?" Mihoshi asked jumping
around.
  "You can't until later!!!" Washu blew into her face. (How it would
seem if was on the show, I'm sure you'll know ^.^)
  "Ok." Mihoshi said happily. She hadn't blinked or noticed the
rudeness.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*In Washu's lab*

  Washu was working very hard on her portal.
  After 4 more hours, Washu was done!
  "HAAAAAAAAWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA. I'm a genuis! Genuis!" Washu
praised herself.
  She pointed her portal beam at the moon, turn it ON, and pulled
the trigger.
  BAM!
  The beam shot out and into the moon. It was so strong that Washu
felled back, and smoke started to go everywhere. She told the computer
to get the fanners, and it did.
  When the smoke finally cleared,she looked at the moon with her super
telescope. The beam had not done damage, but there was a faint green
light. No human could see it, even with her super telescope. She was an
alien, so of course she could see it (no offense. in a GOOD way ^.^)  0
  "I'm a genius! Genius! Geni.....us...." and with that, Washu fell
asleep.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Next morning*

  The next morning, Washu woke up early, even due to her late night ex-
periment, but still tired.
  "Oh Kyione! How did you sleep all day?"
  Washu heard Mihoshi's voice as she strolled into the kitchen. Ryoko
was flying behind her with rings around her eyes.
  "I don't know." Kyione said.
  Mihoshi saw Washu and said, "So. Is the portal thingy done?"
  "Yes!" Washu said now nonsleepy.
  "What are you talking about?" Kyione asked.
  So Washu explained all about the portal and what it did.
  When she was finished, Kyione just blinked.
  "Where's Ry-AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
  Sasami had just gotten up very sleppy with Ayeka coming in behind
her. Sasami was searching the floor for a hint of Ryo-ohki, but she
bumped into Ryoko. When she looked up, she saw tired Ryoko up close
because she had her head down, and that had frightened her.
  "Oh. Sorry Ryoko." Sasami said when she realized it.
  "No problem." Ryoko said sleeply without a hint of annoyance.
  "Good morning." Tenchi said as he came in."
  "Hi." Everyone said at the same time.
  "Anyway, everyone, follow me. Let's experiment this portal." Washu
said as everyone started to followed.
  "Tenchi, will you carry me?" Ryoko asked VERY sleepy.
  "Ok." Tenchi said. He had said yes because she looked VERY tired.
Even too tired to bother him!
  He gave her a piggyback ride to Washu's lab, and put her on a chair.
  "People, this is the actual portal, and that is the beam. The portal
beam took 5 minutes-well, about-, and the portal took 10 hours!" Washu
explained as she pointed to a blue hole just big enough for one of them
to jump into, and a huge laser beam.
  "Do we really get to try it?" Mihoshi asked.
  "Yes. You go first." Washu said.
  "Oooooh. Ok." Mihoshi exclaimed. She ran to the hole and stood on it.
  "Um.... Isn't she supposed to fall?" Tenchi asked with dot eyes (i
think you know how that looks! ^.^).
  Washu scratched her head and said,"Yes. Let me check."
  She went to the her computer and asked it to check it over. After a
minute, the computer gave an OK.
  "That's strange............" Washu said. Then she looked VERY
embarrassed.
  "What is it?" Everyone asked with dot eyes.
  "I used a blue wire instead of a red wire because I ran out." Washu
said scratching her head again.
  "And how can a genius forget that?!" Ayeka yelled at the same time as
Ryoko.
  "Hey. I was very sleepy." Washu said.
  "And what that wire do?" Tenchi asked tapping his foot, and not
looking at her.
  "Reverse." Washu said. "See, that was 2.4 blue. 7.8 is different."
  "Um.. Washu, doesn't that mean that the people will come through into
our world and THEY will be invisible?" Mihoshi asked.
  "Yes. Except the back part. See, I made it so we could ALWAYS see
because I made it here. We can talk to them!" Washu said suddenly
excited again.
  "Oh! I thought this was going to be peaceful for a while!" Tenchi and
Sasami moaned.
  Just then, a hand shot out of the hole, and then 7 figures appeared.
Tenchi and the gang couldn't see them because of the brightness. When
the figures one by one had emerged from the hole, a BRIGHT light shone
from them.
  The shining stopped, and Tenchi ans the gang gaped. They were people
from........
