DBZ: The Ultimate Cell Saga~ episode 2: Ryoko Revealed

Our heroes have just passed Corin's tower, racing to see Dende at the top.
"Dende!" called Gohan.
He was rather excited about seeing the young Namek-they hadn't seen each
other for atleast a month.
Everyone landed on the ground, near the Room of Spirit and Time (or
Hyperbolic Time Chamber, whichever you prefer).
"Dende?....Mr. Popo?" Gohan began to search every inch of the place.
"Go figure, just when you need the stupid little green freak." he hissed in
anger.
"Humph." Gohan turned quickly. "Oh, Piccolo. No offense to you, of course."
Yamcha crossed his arms.
"So what do you suppose we do now, guys?" he asked. There was silence.
*snap*"I've got an idea! Why don't we go to Bulma?" said Krillin.
"What type of an idea is that?!" yelled Tien.
 "That's a pretty considerable thought, Krillin."commented Trunks.
Yamcha grunted in disbelief. "Have you lost your minds?!" Trunks scowled.
"Consider this, Yamcha... My mother knows much more first-aid than all of us
put together, dammit! And with Chichi and my grandmother there too, there's
a
pretty good chance that we can get a little help!"
Yamcha winced at the sound of Trunks' booming voice.
 Nobody had ever heard him speak this way before, so even Goku was really
impressed.
 Yamcha (as well as everyone else) heard his likeness to his father as he
spoke, so he got kinda freaked out.
"Trunks is right..." started Vegeta. "What really matters right now is if
that cursed woman will live or not."
 Everyone stared at Vegeta-all with a puzzled look.
Had they just heard him correctly? Is he actually worried about another
person?!
"What the fuck are you idiots waiting for?! Do you want her to live or
not?!"
With that, they all agreed to leave, and headed towards Capsule Corp.


*What was I saying? I've never acted this way before-not even with Bulma*
thought Vegeta. *Not that I even love Bulma ... but, that new woman is
gorgeous...::drool::* Vegeta hit himself on the head. *Think sensibly,
Vegeta! It's a woman! a creature inferior to yourself!*


Still trailing behind the others, Trunks was deep in thought. He looked down
at the girl in his arms. *She's stopped bleeding, for now. I sure hope that
the women can do something for her...She seems so helpless and, well, whoa!
Get a grip of yourself, Trunks! You don't even know this chick!* A few
minutes passed, and they had finally reached their destination.

*knock,knock* "Open the door! It's us!" called Goku.
 No sooner than he finished his sentence did Bulma burst through the door.

"Vegeta! Trunks! Where the hell have you two knuckleheads been?! I've been
waiting for a whole hour! A WHOLE FUCKING HOUR! Would you want to be stuck
with my idiotic mother for that long?!" Bulma peered down at the girl in her
son's arms. "Holy shit! Trunks! Who the hell is that?!"
Trunks took a deep breath, but was cut off by his mother.
"Aren't you still going out with Hamnio? Yeah, you said that you were going
on another date with her tonight. *gasp* You're cheating on her, aren't
you?!
You little bastard! I told you that I wanted you to be a gentleman, no
matter
what! Wait-why is that girl's head bleeding? Did you rape her?! Oh, dammit
Trunks! Did you kill her? Hopefully she's not a human, cause if she is, I'm
sure you killed her. Aw, fuck. They can put you in jail for this, Trunks!
Chichi, you'd better hold me back, cuz I'm about to MURDER MY OWN SON!!!"

 Bulma landed atleast 5 punches into her son's jaw, and he didn't flinch the
slightest bit.
"Bulma! Please calm down! It's not like that!" said Goku. He lead her inside
while telling her the true story, and the others laughed at her little
'theory'.

 (about 2 hours later)
"Uhhh, my head... Washu? Are you there?.....HAHAHA! I've escaped!
 No more lab labor for me! But ... where am I?"
Ryoko rubbed the back of her head. "Ouch!"
Just then, laughter could be heard outside of the room.
" ... yeah, right! And I can't help if I'm addicted to sex either! Heheh."
said Trunks.
 "WHOA!" Ryoko shot straight up in bed once all of the males rounded the
corner.
" Oh, look! Hey there, miss! I'm glad that you're finally awake!" said
Trunks, praying that she hadn't heard what he'd just said.
Ryoko jumped out of bed and ran to the Z warriors.
" Hi, my name is Ryoko, I'm 17, I was made by the greatest scientific genius
in the Universe-Washu, and ... well..."
"Well what?" asked Gohan.
"...I...I don't remember... I ran away from the lab, cuz Washu went crazy
and
made me become her assistant ... and she wanted me to kill a race of people
called the Saiyans and Nameks or whatever ... hmmm...ah,well!"
She sat back on the bed.
"Who are you guys? What's your name, age, etc.? C'mon! I want info on you
hotties!"
 "Well, my name is Goku, and this is my son Gohan. These are my very best
friends-Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, Chow-Tsu, and Piccolo."
 "And I'm Trunks, and this is...my father... Vegeta."
Ryoko was literally drooling. "You guys are too good to be true! You're all
hott as hell! No-even hotter! Especially you four-Goku, was it? Yeah. Goku,
Trunks, Piccolo, and... ooh."
She pointed her finger at Vegeta and made a motion that said 'come here'.

*This strange woman is calling for me. Should I go? She is so incredibly
alluring ... ah, what the hell! It's not like I'm a married man or anything,
and I'm not with Bulma either...*

*Oh, so you're gonna go? I hope that you know Gohan, Trunks and I can all
hear your little mental conversation*

 *fuck-off, Kakkarot!*

 Vegeta made his way to the woman, and stood in front of her.
"What do you want?" he asked.
Ryoko's eyes gleamed with intensity and wonder. She stretched out her
forefinger and touched his chest.
"You look good in spandex..." she chuckled.
She drew a line down his chest with her finger, all the way down to his
navel. "I've died and gone to heaven..." she mumbled.
Just then, Bulma and Chichi walked into the room.
 "What are you doing?! Get off of him right now!" yelled Bulma.
 Ryoko raised an eyebrow and laughed loudly.

 "...shut your fucking face, uncle fucker..."

*plop* Ryoko fell back on the bed in a deep sleep.
"She's still drugged." said Chichi.
 "She should come to in about another hour or so."
The women left the room, shaking their heads.

"Hey guys." started Trunks.
" Yeah?" said Goku.
 "Ryoko could mean trouble..."

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Our heroes are currently trying to figure out whether or not it is safe to
keep this woman around-but I guess that they'll have to wait and see once she
comes to. N-E Wayz, will Vegeta get seduced by our favorite space pirate?
Will the women get used to her? And finally, what about Trunks' date with
Hamnio? Find out next time-on Dragon Ball Z.
