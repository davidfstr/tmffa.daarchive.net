Ahhh.  I loved that last chapter.  Really, I did.  Okay, I know I'm 
running out of witty and interesting things to say, so instead, I will 
leave off every intro with a few words of wisdom.  Here is this one.  
Never mix toothpaste with soda.  And I don't own Tenchi or Sailor Moon.

	The next morning, Raye and Tenchi walked to school in silence.  
Neither was sure whether the other was feeling happy or upset.  When 
the bell rang, they went their separate ways without even a wave.  At 
lunch, Raye's friends noticed something was wrong.
	"What's your deal Raye?  Usually you can't stop talking for a 
minute at lunch," said Mina.
	"Yeah.  You've been too quiet recently," agreed Lita.  Raye just 
shrugged.
	"I know!  She's lonely and wants to move back in!" cried Serena.
	"No!  I love living at Tenchi's house!" Raye said quickly.
	"You do?" the others said in amazement.  But Serena looked 
closely at Raye.  She was definitely hiding something.  What could she-
oh no! thought Serena.
	"Raye, you didn't!" she cried.
	"Didn't what?" asked Amy.  But Serena just kept looking at Raye.  
Her eyes were lowered, and she kept looking around for something or 
someone.
	"Raye, did you go out with Tenchi again?" Serena asked quietly.
	"What?" the others cried.  Raye looked up at Serena.
	"We just went for another walk.  All we did was talk," Raye said.
	"And?" Serena wasn't convinced.
	"And we started kissing," Raye mumbled, but loudly enough for her 
friends to hear her.  Her friends groaned.
	"If Haruka and Michiru ever find out-"  
	"How could you betray Chad like that?"
	"I told you to take it easy!"
	"Guys, relax," said Amy.  She had put her arm around Raye.  "Has 
Raye ever shown bad judgment when it comes to guys?  If she's got 
feelings for Tenchi, I think it's okay.  Yeah, there's that strange 
energy coming from him, but if he was going to hurt her, he could have 
done it last night.  He didn't hurt you, did he Raye?"
	"No.  He was so nice to me.  I know we can trust him, I know it," 
she said.
	"So Raye, you're sure you can trust him?" said a voice.  Michiru, 
Haruka, and Setsuna appeared.
	"He didn't tell you why his power was so strong, did he?" Haruka 
asked.
	"Actually, he did," Raye said softly.
	"Well, are you going to tell us, or what?" asked Serena 
impatiently.
	"No!  I can't betray him like that!" Raye cried.  Suddenly, 
Serena understood.  For Raye, Tenchi was like Darien to her.  They had 
no secrets, and would never betray each other.  Serena didn't have to 
ask Raye to realize she had told Tenchi she was a Sailor Scout.  
Apparently, no one else had to ask either.
	"Well, unless Pluto wants to turn back time and stop Raye from 
telling Tenchi, we have a problem," said Michiru.
	"Look, Tenchi knows I'm a Sailor Scout, but I didn't tell him 
about you guys.  I'll keep my communicator nearby, and I'll contact you 
if it turns out that I can't trust Tenchi," said Raye.  The others 
nodded reluctantly as the bell rang.

	"Tenchi, are you okay?" Raye asked that evening.
	"Yeah, it's just--" Tenchi trailed off.
	"What?" Raye asked.
	"I feel like I've betrayed Aeka and Ryoko.  They've always fought 
for my attention, but I still haven't told them that you and I-um, you 
know," Tenchi said.
	"Look Tenchi, I don't wasn't to cause problems with your family.  
I'll move back in with my friends, and-" Tenchi cut Raye off.
	"No!  Raye, I've never met someone like you before.  I feel like, 
we're connected somehow.  And," he said, coming closer to her, "I don't 
want to break that connection."
	"Tenchi," Raye put her arms around his neck. "I love you."
	"I love you too Raye," he whispered.  They kissed, but then they 
heard a scream.
	"No!  Tenchi!" Ryoko cried.  She wasn't alone; Aeka was right 
behind her.
	"Tell me this is a dream, tell me this is a dream!" Aeka said.
	"You didn't mean it, did you Tenchi?" Ryoko asked, tears coming 
out of her eyes.
	"You don't really love her, do you?" Aeka sobbed.  Tenchi and 
Raye looked at each other, then realized they were still holding on to 
each other.  Blushing, they let go and stepped away from each other.
	"Come on, guys.  You know that it was nothing, don't you?" Tenchi 
asked desperately.
	"Oh, so that's why you had your arms all over her?" Aeka yelled.
	"Not to mention your lips," Ryoko added.
	"Look, I'm not here to steal Tenchi from you," said Raye.
	"Yeah right.  You are so dead Raye," Ryoko cried.  But before 
either Ryoko or Aeka could attack, Raye had pulled out two of her 
talismans and managed to throw them on their faces.
	"I'm gonna go spend the night with my friends.  I've caused 
enough trouble," Raye said.  Despite the situation, she couldn't resist 
kissing Tenchi one more time before she left.  Tenchi smiled, but 
inside he thought is she worth breaking my family apart?
