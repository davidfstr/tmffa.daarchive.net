    THIS IS THE SEQUEL TO TENGIMON. RYOKO IS STILL MARRIED TO
TENCHI , SUSAMI IS NOW THE 13TH DIGIDESTINED AND AYEKA IS STILL
MAD ( EVEN THOUGH I DIDN’T MENTION IT IN THE FIRST STORY) WITH
RYOKO AND TENCHI. THOUGH IN THIS STORY SASAMI, AYEKA, AND
WASHU AREN’T REALLY MENTIONED MUCH.

HERE AGAIN ARE WHO THESE CHARACTERS BELONG TO:
TENCHI AND RYOKO: LOOK IT UP
FORD PREFECT: DOUGLAS ADAMS
POKEMON: NINTENDO
BLARK FEEGLEWATER: NO COPYRIGHT LAW BUT I’LL BE PRETTY ANGRY IF
YOU USE BLARK OR CREATURES  AS YOUR OWN WORK
SPAM:(ONIA) HORMEL

LET’S BEGIN SHALL WE?

    TENCHI GOT A GOOD JOB AND BOUGHT A COMPUTER. THE ONLY
PROBLEM WAS THAT TENCHI ALWAYS HAD AN UNEASY FEELING THAT HE
WOULD GET SUCKED IN AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HE GOT STUFF FLYING OUT
OF THE COMPUTER TO HIM. THE THINGS WERE POKEBALLS BUT YOU’LL
FIND OUT WHAT WERE IN THEM LATER. HE LOOKING WAS AT HIS STOCKS
WHEN HE GOT AN E-MAIL FROM HIS NEW FRIEND FORD PREFECT TO TAKE
HIS WIFE DOWN TO THE  CHILE’S AND GET SOME FOOD ON HIM BUT BE
SURE TO ORDER SOME SAKI ALONG WITH IT AND HE’LL TELL THEM
WHAT’S GOING ON.

    BY THE TIME FORD GOT THERE IT WAS TOO LATE TO PAY SO THEY
TELEPORTED TO THE RW6 FORD OWNED. NOW TENCHI WAS BARELY AS
HYSTERICAL AS ARTHUR DENT WAS WHEN FORD  SAVED HIM FROM THE
EARTHS DESTRUCTION. NOW OF COURSE THIS WAS  ALTERNATIVE EARTH
NO.78 SO EVERYTHING LOOKED LIKE CARTOONS AND FORD KNEW THIS
AND TOLD TENCHI EVERYTHING LIKE HE WAS FROM BETELGUESE AND
THEY MIGHT NEED TO LEAVE THE EARTH IN CASE OF EMERGENCY AND
THE ONLY REASON HE BELIEVED IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD MARRIED AN
ALIEN AND  SEEN A BUNCH OF THEM  SO HE WASN’T VERY SUPRISED TO
FIND OUT THAT HIS NEWEST FRIEND WAS AN ALIEN. THE EARTH WAS
BLOWN UP BY THE CLEFAIRY’S  WHO WERE MAD AT EARTH FOR KEEPING
THEM AS SLAVES. THE EARTH BLEW UP WITH TENCHI’S DAD, GRAMPA,
AND FRIENDS EXCEPT MIHOSHI AND KYONE WHO WERE ON A GALAXY
POLICE MISSION TO GET ZAPHOD BEBBLEBROX FOR ROBBING THE HEART
GOLD AND TURNING EARTHS 34,79,23,2,6,AND 89 INTO LIQUOR EARTHS
56,7,9,83,70,AND 45 INTO SAUSAGE.  WHAT  CAN BE REVEALED TO KEEP
YOU IN SUSPENSE IS WHAT WERE IN THE POKEBALLS TENCHI RECIEVED
THIS IS TOTALY OUT OF ORDER TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN  THIS  WHAT THE
HITCHIKERS GUIDE HAS TO SAY ON EACH OF THE POKEMON RECIEVE :  1)
SINKING A CLOSE RELATIVE TO GEODUDE EXCEPT THAT IT WAS SAVED
FROM CERTAIN DEATH OF DROWNING AND BECOMING EXTINCT WHEN
CAPTURED  BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORST FASCINATION WITH THE WATER
BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT WEAK TO WATER BUT IS HAS NO SYSTEM OF
BREATHING FOR SWIMMING. EVEN THOUGH IT’S THE 252 POKEMON
MAKING IT LEGENDARY IT IS THE LEAST AMAZING, STUPIDEST AND
CLUMSIEST CREATURE IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. 2)SHUCKLE, WEAK
LITTLE BUG, ROCK POKEMON WITH NO MEANS OF DEFENSE AT ALL, A
COUPLE OF ATTACKS ARE KNOWN BUT OTHER WISE
USELESS.3,4,5)SUICUNE,ENTEI, AND RAIKOU, PROBABLY THE MOST
DISLOYAL AND ESCAPATIVE  POKEMON EVER, IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT
WITH ONE ................. FORGET IT, LET THEM OUT OF THE POKEBALL FOR A
SECOND AND RUN AT MACH 3 TO GET TO ANOTHER CONTINENT.6) A
DOUGHNUT, YES THIS IS, IN FACT, THE EXACT SAME DOUGHNUT ASH
CAUGHT IN PRIMAPE GOES BANNANNAS EXCEPT IT IS MUCH MOLDIER.

    RYOKO SEEING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH AND KNOWIG
AYEKA WAS GONE  SHE PULLED OUT 3 BOTTLES OF SAKI FROM CHILE’S
AND DRANK IT IN UNDER 15 MINUTES AND THEN DOZED FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE DAYS IN WHICH NOTHING GOOD HAPPENED AND THEN AFTER A
WEEK OF BORDOM TENCHI SAW A MUTANT STAR GOAT HEADING FOR THE
SHIP. TENCHI NOT KNOWING WHAT TO MAKE OF  IF PULLED OUT A
POKEBALL AND PRESSED THE BUTTON ON IT THINKING SOMETHING WILL
HAPPEN, SOMETHING DID HAPPEN, THE MOLDY DOUGHNUT DROPPED AND
LANDED ON FORDS NEWEST ISSUE OF “PLAY BEING” .  FORD WAS
EXTREMELY MAD AND USED THE I.I.D. TO TURN THE MUTANT GOAT INTO
A PLANET. THE PLANET WAS GOLGAFRINCHHAM SO THE B-ARCH CAME
AND SETTELED ON IT WHICH CRASHED INTO THE SUN  FIVE SECONDS
LATER. NOBODY KNEW WHAT HORRIBLE FATE IS GOING TO COME DOWN
ON TENCHI BUT WHILE ZOOMING THROUGH THE UNVERSE WITH I.I.F. THEY
RAN INTO THE HEART OF GOLD ALSO USING THE I.I.F. WHICH CAUSED A
CHAIN REACTION.THE FLEET OF BOTH SHIPS SWITCHED.
MIHOSHI AND KYONE WERE TURNED INTO HAMSTERS IN A HAMSTER
BALL. THE PLANET TRINKLANSIUM 56 WAS TURNED INTO ANOTHER
GOLGAFRINCHAM WHICH BLEW UP, AND TRINLANSIUM 54 TURNED INTO
TRINKLANSIUM 56. FORD, TENCHI, AND RYOKO ALONG WITH SHUCKLE
WHO HE HAD LET OF THE POKEBALL.THEY GOT A COUPLE OF BABEL FISH
AND A COUPLE OF PAN GALACTIC GARGLE BLASTERS AND WENT
TOWARDS THE RW6 WHICH THEY CAUGHT UP WITH AND FOUND ZAPHOD
LOOKING AT FORDS PLAY BEING COLLECTION. FORD , NOT RECOGNIZING
HIM AT FIRST BECAUSE NOW HE HAD ONE HEAD FOUR ARMS NOW  WENT
OVER AND GOT ZAPHOD VERY ANNOYED . THEY JOURNEYED ON. STILL
BOARD UNTIL THE SHIP CRASHED ON CRAWLMACAN  WHERE WERE
CHASED OUT OF TRILIY AND STRAIT INTO SPAMONIA WHERE THEY WER
CALM EVEN A GIANT HAMSTER TRIED TO BITE ZAPHOD. AFTER THAT
HAPPENED, ZAPHOD AND FORD TOLD TENCHI THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN SIX
POKEBALLS AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS IN THEM.AT THIS MOMENT
RYOKO HAD SOME STARTLING NEWS FOR THEM TO AND HERE HER EXACT
WORDS,” I’M PREGNANT”. THEY WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THE WORST DAY
OF THERE LIFE. THE WORST PART HAS ALREADY HAPPENED YET THINGS
JUST AS BAD WILL BEGIN. THEY MADE THERE WAY THROUGH THE TREES
INTO THE DISTANT LAND OF SPAMONIA. THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE
GALAXY SAYS ,”SPAMONIA IS MOST INSANE PLACE OF ANY KIND IN THE
UNIVERSE, IF YOU JOURNEY TO THERE DON’T DRINK THE WATER OR THE
WATER MIGHT DRINK YOU. HAMSTERS ARE DOUBLY DANGEROUS THEY
WILL SHOCK, BURN, BITE , MAME, AND OTHER WISE DESTROY ANYTHING
THAT SMELLS LIKE FOOD. WHATEVER YOU DO DON’T VISIT SPAMONIA.”
THEY HAD STUMBELED INTO THE “PEACEFUL WARZONE” OF SPAMONIA
KNOWN AS THE CITY OF INSANITY.THE CHEESE SELLER INVITED THEM
INTO HIS STORE AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE HISTORY OF SPAMONIA. HE
SAID,” KING BLARK FEEGLEWATER ,  WAS A EAMELF WHEN HE BEGAN HIS
LIFE, HE WAS LATER CHARGED OF PLAYING WITH BUMS WHICH WAS ONLY
DEALT WITH BY SHAPESHIFTING AND SENDING HIM AWAY. HE WAS SENT
TO HABISAM WHERE HE WAS A HAMSTERON UNTIL HE TOOK CHEESE, A
MAJOR DRUG IN THE SOCIETY OF THE HAMSTERONS. HE WAS TURNED
INTO AN ELEKTRON ALONG WITH 2 OTHER FRIENDS AND LIVED AS A LIGHT
PARTICLE UNTIL HE TOOK OVER THE BODY OF A ZILICANCANRY, HE FRIED
THE MEMORY AND TOOK CONTROL. HE WAS IN THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL
HE WAS FOUND TAKING ALTERIAN DOLLARS FROM YOU ZAPHOD.”

    “OH, I REMEMBER THAT”

    HE CONTINUED ON,” HE SENT  AS A TRILINIUM TO THIS PLANET , WE
SAW YOU RUNNING OUT OF THE CITY. WE WENT TO !?, A PLANET AT  IN
THIS SOLAR SYSTEM, BUT IT EXPLODED SO WE USED THE TELEPORT
TRIANGLE AND CAME TO EARTH. WE USED THE TELEPORT TRIANGLE TO
GET TO HERE AND THIS WHERE WE’VE STAYED.”

    FORD SAID,” SO YOUR TELLING ME THIS IS THE SAME BLARK
FEEGLEWATER FROM THE HAMSTERON AD SAYING ‘ DON’T DO CHEESE’?”

    “YES”

    “AND THIS IS THE SAME BLARK FEEGLEWATER WHO WAS  STEALING
MY ALTERIAN DOLLARS, AND THE INVENTOR OF THE NOT ALCHOHOLIC
PAN GALACTIC GARGLE BLASTER( CONTACT ME FOR THE RECIPE)  FOR
WHICH I SUED ?” SAID ZAPHOD.

    “YES”

    “AND THE SAME BLARK FEEGLEWATER WHO WAS HAVING NAUGHTY
DREAMS ABOUT ME AND TOLD ME?”SAID RYOKO.

    “YES”

    “OH MY !”

    “ I DON’T GET IT” SAID TENCHI.

    “WE WILL SEE HIM TOMMOROW” SIAD THE CHEESE SELLER,” AND
MY NAME IS SABACOUS”

    BRIGHT AND EARLY IN THE MORNING THEY WENT TO GO SEE THE
KING IN HIS SPAM CAN CASTLE ( NO HE WASN’T TINY THE CAN WAS HUGE)
EXCEPT FOR RYOKO WHO STAYED IN BED BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING ILL.
THE KING GREETED THEM. HE CHALENGED  TENCHI, FORD, AND ZAPHOD
TO A BATTLE. FIRST BLARK SENT OUT POINTY, THE SLARTON, WHILE
TENCHI SENT OUT SHUCKLE WHICH IMMEDIATLY GAVE POINTY A CUP OF
JUICE WHICH MADE SLARTON STRONGER AND DESTROYED SHUCKLE.
NEXT TENCHI LET OUT ENTEI , THEN SUICUNE, THEN RAIKOU WHICH RAN
AWAY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS . THEN TENCHI LET OUT SINKING  WHICH
RAN INTO THE WATER AND DROWNED. TENCHI HAD LOST BUT FORD’S
TURN HAD JUST BEGUN. HE ONLY HAD FIVE POKEBALLS BUT HE DIDN’T
CARE. HE SENT OUT ZAPDOS, ARTICUNO, MOLTRES, LUGIA, AND HO-OH
BUT LIKE THE DOGS THEY FLEW AWAY. ZAPHOD WAS THERE ONLY
CHANCE BUT IN HIS POKEBALLS HE FOUND NOTHING EXCEPT  FOR A
SPRAYPAINTED IN ONE SAYING” MEWTWO WAS HERE”. THEY HAD LOST.
THERE LEGENDARY ANIMALS HAD ESCAPED, AND TTHEY HAD NO WAY OF
FINDING A GOOD PLANET TO SETTLE ON SO THEY ASKED BLARK IF THEY IF
THEY COULD GET A HOUSE SOMWHERE IN SPAMONIA. BLARK AGREED TO
LET THEM . THEY LIVED INSANELY FOR A WHILE.

     ONE THING THAT MAKES THIS STORY WORK IN A WAY IS THAT IN
TENCHI UNIVERSE MIHOSHI AND KYONE ARE GALACTIC POLICE WHILE IN
THE RESTURANT AT THE END OF THE UNIVERSE ZAPHOD AND THE OTHERS
WERE ATTACKED BY THE GALACTIC POLICE.

    NOT ALL THE EVENTS IN THIS STORY AREN’T TRUE. I AM BLARK
FEEGLEWATER, I DID INVENT THE NON-ALCHOHOLIC PAN GALACTIC
GARGLE BLASTER , AND I HAVE HAD NAUGHTY DREAMS OF RYOKO.

  THE END
