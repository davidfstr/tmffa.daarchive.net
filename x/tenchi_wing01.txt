   THIS IS THE THIRD STORY I’VE WRITTEN IT IS THE SEQUEL TO LIFE, TENCHI
UNIVERSE, AND SPAMONIA. TENCHI AND RYOKO ARE LIVING IN SPAMONIA,
RYOKO IS 8 MONTHS IN HER PREGNANCY, FORD IS STILL AN E-MAIL AWAY,
ZAPHOD HAS BEEN RE-ELECTED FOR GALACTIC PRESIDENT, AND
AYEKA,SUSAMI, MIHOSHI, AND KYONE ARE STILL DEAD.

    IN THIS HEERO AND DUO FIND SPAMONIA AFTER THE EARTH WAS
BLOWN UP.

THE STUFF OF WHO THIS BELONGS TO,
TENCHI AND RYOKO: LOOK IT UP
GUNDUM WING: ?
SPAM: HORMEL
BLARK AND OTHER CREATURES: NO COPYRIGHT
FORD PREFECT AND OTHER GUIDE CHARACTERS: DOUGLAS ADAMS

    THE YEAR IS A.C. 198 TWO GUNDAM PILOTS WENT AGAINST THE LAW
AND KEPT THIER GUNDAM, IN THE A.C. 198 THE EARTH WAS DESTROYED
BY THE CLEFAIRY IN THE ANGER AT HUMANS .ONE OTHER HUMAN
SURVIVED THIS DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH. THIS IS THE REST OF THE
STORY.
    TENCHI AND RYOKO WERE HAVING SUPRISINGLY PEACEFUL DAY IN
CHAOTIC  SPAMONIA. TENCHI WAS WANDERING WHAT TO DO. IT WAS SO
PEACEFUL IT WAS BORING. USALLY IN A DAY AT LEAST ONE BOMB BLEW
UP OR A VACUUM CREATURE WAS SUCKING UP PEOPLE BUT NOT TODAY.
RYOKO WAS JUST SITTING IN A CHAIR BECAUSE OF HER BEING PREGNANT.
EVERYTHING WAS BORING UNTIL 2 GIANT ROBOTS LANDED NEXT TO THE
HOUSE. TWO YOUNG MEN JUMPED OUT. ONE HAD A LONG CHESNUT BRAID
WHILE THE OTHER ONE HAD SHORT  HAIR AND A SERIOUS LOOK ON HIS
FACE. ONE OF THE ROBOTS HAD BLACK BAT WINGS AND ON COULD
TRANSFORM INTO A PLANE . TENCHI WENT OUT TO GREET THEM AND
FOUND OUT THEY WERE HUMANS THEN THE LONG HAIRED ONE SAID
” WELL I GUESS THE EARTH WASN’T DESTROYED AFTER ALL” BUT AT THAT
MOMENT A DOBIR FLEW NEXT TO HIM AND TRY TO GET SOME MEAT. “ I’M
DUO MAXWELL AND THE GUY NEXT TO ME IS HEERO YUY. WE’VE BOTH
BEEN ANNOYED SINCE THE WHATEVER THEY WERES CAME AND BLEW UP
THE PLANET AND HILDE AND RELINA WERE ON IT TOO SO WE’LL NEVER
SEE THEM AGAIN UNLESS THIS IS EARTH BUT WHAT WAS THAT THING. “

    “I’M SORRY, THIS ISN’T EARTH . IT’S CRAWLMACAN AND TO BE
EXACT WE ARE IN THE KINGDOM OF SPAMONIA. HOW DID YOU GET HERE
FROM EARTH?” SAID TENCHI.

    “WE DON’T KNOW. THE EXPLOSION BLEW US BACK TO THE
FARTHEST REACHES OF SPACE BUT WE DIDN’T FLY BACK. WE WERE
ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO OUR GIRLFRIENDS BUT GUESS IT’S OVER. WE
LOST  THEM FOR GOOD. IF YOUR HERE, AREN’T THERE OTHER HUMANS
HERE?”ASKED DUO.

    “YES, PHEONIX , IN THE LEAST INSANE CITY KNOWN AS
WEOPANTRY, THE KING , BLARK FEEGLEWATER IS A HUMAN, WELL SORT
OF, AND THERE IS   SETH   , A HUMAN  IN FLYING FISHBURG.”SAID TENCHI

    “ ARE THERE ANY OTHER INTELLEGENT CREATURES IN SPAMONIA?”
ASKED HEERO.

    “ WELL YES, MANY, A FILING CABINET DRAWER FULL.” SAID TENCHI.

    “ WHAT ABOUT YOU? DID YOU LOSE YOUR SWEETHEART IN THE
EXPLOSION?” DUO ASKED.

    “ NO, MY WIFE IS IN THE HOUSE” SAID TENCHI, “AND SHE’S
PREGNANT “.

    “ALL RIGHT, LETS GO IN THE HOUSE AND TALK “ SAID HEERO

    THEY HAD GOTTEN SOME RAINBOW BERRY TEA WHICH TASTED
DIFFERENTLY TO EVERYBODY . THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE KING
WHEN A PLANE LANDED IN THE YARD. TENCHI WAS NOW HAVING A GOOD
DAY WITHOUT BEING DANGER . HE WENT OUT AND HEARD THE SAME
STORY HE DID FROM THE GUYS SO HE THOUGHT THAT THEY MUST BE
HILDE AND RELENA. HE BROUGHT THEM INSIDE WHERE THEY SAW DUO
AND HEERO. THE QUESTION ON EVERYONE’S MIND WAS HOW ARE THEY
SUPPOSE  TO GET MARRIED.AT THAT MOMENT TENCHI SPOKE UP,” WELL, I
SEE YOU ARE BACK TOGETHER SO I COULD PERFORM A WEDDING
CEREMONY”. THE NEXT WEEK DUO GOT MARRIED TO HILDE, AND HEERO
GOT MARRIED TO RELANA.

    THE NEXT MONTH, RYOKO GAVE BIRTH TO A BOY AND NAMED HIM
  KHAKIS.  THIS BABY WAS STRANGE IN THE SENSE THAT BECAUSE OF
RYOKO’S GENES AND TENCHI’S GENES FROM THE JURAI SIDE OF THE
FAMILY THE BABY COULD WALK, TALK, AND EAT SOLID FOOD IN ONLY A
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

    ONE YEAR LATER, FORD CAME FOR A VISIT . HE DIDN’T NEED TO
JUST TALK BUT HE NEEDED TO MAKE A GUIDE ENTRY ON GUNDAMS,
RYOKO,AND FLYING FISHBURG. HE WENT TO THE GUNDAM PILOTS TO GET
THE ENTRY ON GUNDAMS . FORD STAYED FOR A WHILE.

    WHILE FORD WAS AT THE HOUSE, KING PETER KIDNAPPED
KHAKIS,RYOKO, RELENA,AND HILDE. THEY WENT TO KING BUT THE KING
COULDN’T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . “ THE ONLY SPACE SHIP SPAMONIA
OWNS IS THE KINGDOM SO WE CAN’T USE TO RESCUE FOUR PEOPLE. IF
YOU CAN FIND A SHIP, I WILL SUPPLY HELP” SAID BLARK. FORD SUDDENLY
REMEMBERED HIS RW6, SO THEY PILED IN WITH WEOPONS FROM
WEOPONTRY, MAYOR SETH,  AND THE JUNK SELLER. HEERO AND DUO
FOLLOWED IN THEIR GUNDAMS FOR A DANGEROUS TRIP WAS AHEAD.

     TO BE
CONTINUED..........
    I ADDED THE TINIEST BIT OF DBZ IN THAT KHAKIS IS A NAME LIKE
TRUNKS,OR DR BRIEFS.

          IF ANYBODY UNDERSTANDS IT AND LIKES MY FANFICS TELL ME. WOULD
ANYONE LIKE TO SEE A LEMON SOMETIME FROM ME?
