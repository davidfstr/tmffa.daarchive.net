)(to all readers of my former chapter, sorry for the confusion in that, I
was
using quotes and they look like this "" on the send, so from now in I
will
use these for simpler reading ~~~, ok, I own NOTHING of this Anime or Game,
so for your entertainment, now playing- Chrono Muyo Saga-Chapter 2-A helping

hand by an unknown girl)(

              Tenchi couldn t believe his ears he was still alive!
He didn t
have a grave on Cape Howl, he did have a marking there when he met Ayeka
there once though.  He ran as fast as he could out of the village and to
Cape
Howl.  Panting, he stopped to catch his breath. ~No, I'm alive I don't
have a
grave~ he said just as his eyes opened wide. He was looking at a single
grave
there at the cape.

He read it to himself

                                  R. I. P.
                             Our Beloved Tenchi
                          Who died at the age of 7
                           What came from the sea
                           Has now returned to it

               He backed up. ~NO NO! IT ISNT TRUE!~he yelled.  Tenchi
had no idea
of what fate had delivered to him.   As he backed up, 3 men walked onto the
cape behind him. ~So you are the ghost eh?~ said the leader of the 3. 
~This
is a ghost? He looks more like a normal boy to me sir.~ Said a short orange
haired man beside him.  ~I agreedingly agree sir, he is a normal boy~ said
the other man, tall and skimpy.  ~OH SHUT UP THE BOTH OF YEH! I'm just
following 'His' orders and look,here he is~  The three started to step
forward when someone s voice rang out.

              ~HOLD YER HORSES THERE!~

               Tenchi looked up astonished.  It was the girl in his
dream! It was
the same, gold eyes, blue hair she was the same!  The girl jumped beside
Tenchi. ~So yer the ghost? That's unfair, 3 on1.  ILL EVEN THESE ODDS!~
she
said getting in a fighting stance.   The 3 enemies also got in a stance.
Tenchi took out his weapon, the same as that in his dream, his Sea Swallow,
the blades carved of fish bone.  )(Its not a bird for you animal lovers,
it s
a BIG BLADE)( The fight raged, explosions and fire all about. 

              ~Sir, these aint no normal kids!~yelled the short and
tall one
together.  They turned and fled their necks literally yellow.  ~This
isn t the
last you will see of me ghost, I swear it~ said the leader as he fled. ~We
will take yeh on any time!~ said the girl as she sat down.   ~By the way
what
is your name~ Asked Tenchi.  ~You can call me Ryoko~ she said with a
pleasant
smile. ~Now don t be thinkin anythin just because I'm cute an' all~
she
said.

~No, I'd rather find this out on my own Ryoko~   He said. She stood up and
walked over to him, right face to face. ~You mean your turnin down an offer
to have a beautiful lady like myself by yer side?~ she said. ~Yes, I am~ he
said ~Well, ill be off then. I will meet you in Tirmina!~she said as she ran

off.

Tenchi awoke the next morning in his room.   A small animal was beside him
and
for some reason; Ayeka was standing beside his bed. ~Rise and shine!~ she
said. The animal woke up as well. ~Oh, and this is Ryo-Ohki.~ she said.
Ryo-Ohki stretched and yawned.  ~I know your going to Tirmina, so why
don t I
and Ryo-Ohki come along as well?~ said Ayeka.~I guess that would be ok~ said

Tenchi sitting up. ~Ok, lets get going~ she said as she literally dragged
him
out of the village.
