This fic is a crossover continuation fic for both the 
Ranma and Tenchi Universe.  Tenchi and the gang won't be 
introduced for a long while, but that will all be explained
as you read. Hopefully you readers know some basic knowledge
about both Ranma and Tenchi:)  I would rate this as a "R"
fanfic, because of some of the harsh language used. This 
ain't a lemon though, I don't plan on having any sex scenes
at all. 

Here are a few things you must know while reading this:

-For all you people who read this, PLEASE read the notes
at the end before you flame me, maybe the answer to your
questions or complaints may be answered that way. If not,
feel free to e-mail me.

-The Ranma aspect of the story takes place after Manga 38 
and the Tenchi aspect takes place after the TV show/OVA.

-At the end of manga 38 Ranma was at the end of his 
sophomore year in Furinken High School and the year is set
in 1992.

-The Japanese school system is the same as the American 
system, with new semesters beginning in fall  and ending 
in summer. I KNOW it's different in Japan, but I made it
that way just for this story.

-Also Ranma still has his curse, but his female form has 
black hair (like the manga) and is now just as tall as his
male form.

-As far as the LAPD is concerned, the infamous Rampart 
scandal never happened.

-For now in this universe Ranma's curse is accepted just 
about everywhere with a quick explanation from Ranma. Don't 
ask why, it just makes the story easier to understand.

-And finally, (for now) Ranma as you read him in this intro
will seem very out of character.  But this will all be 
explained with some flashbacks and explanations!

Chapter 1  Meet Officer Ranma



March 23rd 2001 12:30 AM  

[The scene opens and the camera shows a view of downtown Los
Angeles late at night.  The camera pans to a 7-Eleven where 
a young and pretty lady is working the register.  She has a
bored look on her face and watches as a big burly hispanic
guy with tattoos on his arms enters the store and looks 
around.]


				*	*	*
 

[The camera zooms to a 1990 Mercedes benz S-Class parked
across and facing the 7-Eleven.  The car is an unmarked 
detective's vehicle with internal police lights and sirens.
Inside we see 2 people, a middle age white caucasian guy in
the passenger seat and a stern looking asian man with a 
pigtail in the driver's seat.  Both are casually dressed and
have large weapons in their lap.]

Caucasian guy: Damn this is fucking boring.  When is this guy
coming in?

Asian guy:[speaks with a light asian accent] Have a little
patience, he'll be here John.

John: Yeah, yeah.  I don't have as much patience as you do
Ranma.  I've been working in the SIS for 5 years, and I've
been around you for long enough to savor for action eh? 
[Chuckles]

Ranma: I've seen enough action to last a fuckin' lifetime.
[Thinks, then speaks] Probably more than even you could 
handle.

John:[sarcastically] Yeah right.  With your curse, you can
do more assignments in the department than anyone else.  
You have a great gift.  Not that I'd want it....

Ranma: I got used, to it, but everyone keeps wanting me to 
do VICE jobs, and be a posing hooker. Those damn bastards. 
Not to mention the guys who try to hit on me when they know
I'm a male.  The day I go out with a guy will be the day I
suck your dick John.

John:[Trying to look annoyed] Thanks, but you can go fuck 
yourself. 

Ranma: [Grins] Hmph.

[The radio in their car starts bleeping and Ranma accepts 
the message.]

Radio: 6 William 56, please respond.

Ranma:[Picks up phone piece for radio]Sergeant Saotome and
Lieutenant McClane here.

Radio: Suspect has been spotted walking toward Wilshire and
Pico blvd.  He should be in your sights soon.

Ranma: Thanks.

[On cue, they see a Hispanic male walking into the 7-Eleven
who starts walking around the store]

Ranma:[Points to guy]Is that him?

John: [Loads his sniper rifle with ammo and cocks the action]
Yeah. That guy was just released from San Quentin Penitentiary
 two weeks ago.  His name is Roberto Dominguez, charged with
murdering 15 different people working as clerks in various
late night businesses.  He raped all the girls he came 
across in his crime spree too. However, he appealed to the
courts saying he didn't do anything except for attack 
people. He's pretty decent at covering his tracks. Served
only 2 years. 

Ranma: [He loads a Colt M4 Carbine with a 100 round drum 
magazine and cocks it.] Vicious fucker ain't he?

John: No shit.  We managed to get one of his old "buddies" 
to snitch for us so we can track his next hit. He's armed 
pretty well, has a couple of auto pistols with him if I heard
correctly. It seems the rat motherfucker gets a kick out of
all this.

Ranma:[Laughs]Like we don't?

[Right then a scream is heard and the Hispanic guy is 
attacking the girl in the store.  He starts tearing off her 
clothes and rapes her.]

Ranma:[Not even the least bit disturbed at what's happening]
Here we go!

[Ranma starts up the car and drives straight into the store
crashing through.  The suspect snaps the girl's neck and 
struggles to put on his pants as he tries to escape.]

Ranma: LAPD! Don't fucking move![Aims rifle]

Roberto:[In a Mexican accent]Suck my dick honchos! [Pulls 
out two chopped off assault rifles and shoots wildly.]

John: Shit!

[They both duck as the bullets whiz by them barely and busts
all the windows.  Roberto is out the store and stops a big
pickup truck and steals it]

Ranma:[Pulls the car out and gives chase] I thought you said
he had auto pistols not fuckin' chop off rifles!!

John: [sheepishly] I didn't know...

Ranma:[Talks to the radio] All units, all units! This is 
3-William-56! Suspect is heading west on Wilshire in a black
Dodge Ram!  The license plate is 4-Franklin-Mary-Jane-6-7-4!
He has two assault rifles, pursue with extreme caution!

[An old unmarked suburban with police sirens and lights comes
out about a hundred yards behind Ranma's car and gives a 
furious chase.]

Roberto:[Yelling out of the passenger side and shooting at 
the Benz.] I ain't goin' back you fucking pigs! Fuck you! 
Ha Ha! [to the driver] Keep going you fucking cracker or 
else I'll kii~~ll you!

Ranma:[punches off the remains of the windshield and is 
firing his rifle] Damn! That truck is swerving too much! 

John:[Shooting out the tires] Stop whining!

[Ranma's rifle runs out of bullets and he throws it in the
back.  He takes out his Beretta 92FS pistol and gets an idea.
Meanwhile the tires on the Dodge are blown out and the car
is leaking fuel.]

Ranma:[Dodges a bullet that went through the windshield]We
gotta take him out fast!  John, hold the fuck on all right?
You ain't gonna like what I'm about to do! [Cracks the fuse
panel in the car and yanks them all out]  

John:[Hastily puts on his seat belt] Why'd you do that?

Ranma: To turn off the ABS! [He speeds the car up so that
it is in front of the truck] HANG ON!![Violently turns the
steering wheel while slamming the brakes and the accelerator]

[The Benz does a 360 swerve at 60 mph and Ranma shoots a 
flurry of bullets out the window at the passenger side of 
the truck seeing a clean shot.  Roberto accidentally shoots 
the driver of the truck before getting a bullet in his head.]

John:[Is firing his weapon wildly at what he can] HOO YEAH!!!

[The Benz completes its revolution and slams to the side of
the truck.  Both cars hit a high curb and lose control.  
Ranma's car flips to the side and is a mess but no one is 
hurt.  The truck however slams against a concrete wall.]

John:[Disoriented]Uhh...What the fuck happened?

Ranma:[Rubbing head]Uhhgg..Got a Triple A card?[Struggling 
out of his inverted car and reloading his rifle with another
drum from the back of the car as he runs to the mangled 
truck.] Come on John we gotta make sure that fucker is dead!

John: [Also gets out of the car unhurt and joins Ranma with 
his rifle] Fire!!

[Both unleash a hail of bullets against the truck until 
they're emptied out.  They see various parts of the truck 
falling apart and see a large stream of blood. Both officers
just shrug and smile.]

Ranma:[Relieved and tired] Another successful bust.

John: [Yawns] Righhhht...  Lets have someone else take care
of this shit.  I'm tired.

[An officer in a squad car comes up to them and is looking
at the mess]

Cop:[Horrified] What happened here?!

Ranma:[Thinks to himself] This guy is probably a rookie.
[Out loud] The suspect executed the hostage and we 
exterminated him.[Walks off with a uninterested expression
on his face.]

[More cops arrive and the area is a busy swarm, and the
camera fades to black as Ranma and John take a lower 
officer's car and drives back to Parker Center*.]

*Parker Center is a huge building that is the HQ of the LAPD
in real life



					*	*	*


One week later at a lively bar in West LA

March 30th 9:00 PM

[The camera shows the scene of a bar where a bunch of guys
are laughing amongst each other and are eating heartily.  
While everyone else is drinking beer Ranma is drinking sake
in a little cup with a bottle next to it]

Cop1:[Laughing, slightly drunk]So Saotome, you gonna take
that job offer? 

Cop2:[Also drunk]You said you always wanted to go back to 
Japan right? This is your chance!  And that job pays pretty
good too!

Cop1: Yeah, go for it! We'll miss you here though! I've 
never killed so many people at once in this group since you 
joined.

John:[Sober]Come on guys, let him decide.  If you do take 
it, we will miss you though.  

Ranma: I don't know... [He has a letter in his hand that is
addressed to him from the Japanese National Security Agency.
The letter is very unorthodox.]

Cop2: What does the letter say by the way?

[Everyone peers over Ranma's shoulder to see what it says.]

----------------------

-----------------------

John: Hey, not fuckin' bad!

Cop1: Yeah, I wouldn't mind a job that has a lot of perks 
like that!

Ranma: Yeah, but I don't know.  You guys are like my brothers,
I don't really have anyone back in Japan.

John: You know, you never really talked much about your life
in Japan.

Cop2: He's right you know, you never talked about your life
other than your training trip with your dad and how you got
your curse. [Squirts some water in a straw at Ranma's face 
activating the curse.]

[We notice that Ranma didn't shrink at all, just got a lot 
thinner in width and much curvier and prettier than we are 
used to seeing her.]

Ranma-chan:[Wipes face] Very funny asshole. [Gazes at 
nothing in particular] I never did tell you guys did I? 
Except for the fiancee shit?

John: That always sounded like a load of shit to me. Even 
if you are a lady killer you ain't that big of a hotshot.  

Cop2: You're still one fine lady when you're cursed! Ha ha!
ERK! Ah..ah...

Ranma-chan:[One hand is crunched around Cop2's nuts while 
the other hand is taking out a couple of pictures from a 
wallet] Take a look at this if you faggits don't believe me!

[In Ranma's hand there are various pictures of Ranma with 
Akane, Ukyo, and Shampoo back in Ranma's high school days.]

Cop1: Wow, they're really pretty! I guess you weren't full
of shit. What're their names?

Cop2:[Face turning blue, wheezing] Ranma.. I'm sorry.. 
please let go...

Ranma-chan:[Grinning, let's go and continues] That'll teach 
you, you fucker... Anyway the blue haired girl is Shampoo, 
the one with the huge spatula is Ukyo Kuonji, and the one
with short hair is Akane Tendo.[sighs]

John: Shampoo? What the fuck kind of name is that? Does she
have a fuckin' mom named soap and a dad named toothpaste?
[Everyone including Ranma bursts out laughing]

Ranma-chan:[Tries to regain composure] Ha ha! Oh man, she 
had the hots for me. That crazy bitch... You know I probably
could've gotten her in the sack in a second if I asked her,
except for the fact that she's a fuckin' nut!

All: Why?

John: I remember, you said they all tried to do something
to get you!

Ranma-chan: Yeah, except for Akane, she always hit me on the
head with a mallet.  Ukyo was my best friend, not anymore by
now, I had a pet name for her and called her Ucchan. Shampoo
is a Chinese Amazon who was required to marry me because of
her cocksucking Amazon laws. It required that any male who 
defeats an Amazon female is required to marry the bitch. 

Cop1: So, what happened?

Ranma-chan: [Gradually gets angrier and gets louder]For two 
FUCKING years I had to put up with their shit!! [Notices 
others getting nervous and regains composure]They kept 
poisoning me, use narcotics against me, and trick me into 
marrying them. They were friends, and I didn't see them as 
lovers at all. Akane however...[becomes somber]

John: What about her?

Ranma-Chan: She was the only person I truly loved.  I even 
told her that I did in my sophomore year. She used to hit me
all the time because I made fun of her.  Because of her I 
tried to make a plan to get away from the other fiancees.  

All:[as if something was made clear] Ohhh...

Ranma-chan:[sadly] For the remaining two years of high 
school I worked my ass off so that I could go to an American
college and get away from Japan. I surprised a lot of people.
By the time I graduated I was getting straight A's with 
honors and I was accepted to UCLA thanks to some contacts. 
It was a real achievement, I used to be a fuckin' failure 
when it came to academics. But love drove me on. 

All: Wow.

John: How'd you pay for everything though? It must have all 
been expensive.

Ranma-chan:I did ROTC* for the Army once every month and 
they paid for everything. It was easy for me and kept me 
in good physical shape.
*ROTC in the Reserve Officer Training Corps

Cop2: What happened to Akane?

Ranma-chan: I promised Akane that I would return to her and
marry her and she was thrilled. [Gets a furious look in his
eyes] However because I was so involved in school I didn't 
even visit home till graduation. I only got occasional 
letters and phone calls. I was so involved in school that 
I graduated in only three years![smiles at the thought]

John:Hmm... But what happened when you graduated?

Ranma-chan: My mom and dad were the only ones who visited. 
When I went back to Nerima I was in for a shock.[Furious 
again] I found out that Akane had cheated on me, she was in 
love with another person. They hadn't slept together, but 
when I found out who and why I got pissed.

All:[Curious] Who was it?

Ranma-Chan: It was a somewhat good friend of mine. Ryoga 
Hibiki. A person who couldn't find his way out of a fuckin'
closet if his life depended on it. Worst sense of direction
in the world.  When I saw him though he had bought a 
handheld GPS receiver and his days of getting lost were 
over.

John: How did it happen?

Ranma-chan: Akane was lonely by herself in Tokyo University.
She still loves me now, but as a friend. She had been 
attacked one night her freshman year but was overpowered by
a bunch of thugs. Her martial arts wasn't good enough to 
defend herself. That's when Ryoga found her fortunately and
helped her out.  Over the next few years I guess they grew 
close...

John: Let me guess, you were horrified and heartbroken so 
you fled to the U.S. and joined the Los Angeles Police 
Academy?

Ranma-chan: I didn't RUN away. I was about to tell Akane 
about Ryoga's curse, that he was the little black pig that
she had kept as a pet. However luckily for Ryoga he had 
found Jusenkyo by accident and cured himself.[In a 
thoughtful position] You know, he wasn't that bad a guy,
he brought back some of the stuff that was the cure for my
curse and offered it to me, but my mind was in a turmoil 
and I completely went overboard.  But... I knew in my heart
that beating him up wouldn't change anything, so I let him 
be. He's not completely at fault. [Changes mood] You remember
how I told you guys about my career as a teacher? 

All: Yeah.

Ranma-chan: When I married Akane I was supposed to take her
family dojo and be a teacher there. However, that didn't 
happen so it left me wondering about my future. I loved 
helping people and making them feel better in college by 
defending them with my martial arts. I was also really 
interested in police work because they got to help the 
defenseless and carried guns too.

John: Glad you feel that way.

Ranma-chan:[Nods]So did my mom. My dad Genma was an asshole
and he blamed me for losing Akane and the dojo. He was such
a greedy bastard. He used to have a curse too, you know. 
Turned into a panda, but was cured thanks to Ryoga. Ryoga
brought back cures for everyone who had a curse, but I'm the
only one who didn't use it.

Cop1: That's strange of you.

Ranma-chan:[Thoughtful]Sort of. I've changed a lot in 9 
years. I didn't used to fucking cuss all the time or even 
think of the prospect of killing anyone.[Shakes head]I used 
to be so hard headed that I never apologized for anything 
and I always insulted people before thinking twice. When I 
was 16 I never would have imagined being a cop right now.  
Can you guys imagine me being a nice guy who doesn't like 
to hurt people?

John:[Laughs] It's not like you enjoy killing for yourself.
You do it for the sake of the safety of the citizens of LA.
By the way, why didn't you take the cure?

Ranma-chan:[Looks thoughtful]After nearly ten years I got 
used to it, and it's a great advantage. Anyway, my mom was
happy that I wanted to be a cop and supported me fully. She
knew how reputable LA cops were and said that my job would
bring great honor to the family, despite what my old man 
said. Heh. Getting into Elysian Park* was a fuckin' joke. 
Can't believe how easy it was in there.

*Elysian Park is the location of the Los Angeles Police 
Academy, near Dodger Stadium.

Cop2: I remember. You were given SWAT training right? I 
remember that's how you got so good at everything.

Ranma-chan:[Smiling]Yeah. I even got special permission to 
train at Camp Pendleton with Navy SEALs. That was helluva a 
lot of fun! And I was lucky too! The South Korean 707th 
Special Forces Battalion was there to train with the SEALs.
Those guys are fuckin' animals, great martial artists and 
great fighters too!

All: Who the fuck are they?

Ranma-chan: The 707 are the Korean equivalent of Delta Force,
they're the highest SF team in their nation, and definitely
one of the best in the world. But the coolest thing about 
them was their fighting style, Tuk-gong Moo-sul.

John: Oh, the thing you use when you fight hand to hand 
with guys and kill them?

Ranma-chan: Yeah. Literally translated it means "The 
Specialty Art". It's way more effective than my family's
art, the Saotome Ryuu of Musabetsu Kakutou.

Cop1: What's that mean?

Ranma-chan:[Hit's her own head in realization]Oh yeah,
translated it means the indiscriminate art of grappling, 
Vince. I like to call it Anything Goes.

Vince: Oh.

Cop2:[Drinks some hard liquor that he ordered while 
Ranma-chan was talking] So what'd you learn?

Ranma-chan:[Chuckles] I never would have admitted that they
were more effective until their weakest guy fucked me up 
good and hard in less than 30 seconds.  They laughed at me
in a playful way and decided to teach me their art since I 
was a nice guy at heart and was a cop with potential.[Notices
her friend getting himself plastered with liquor] Easy with
that drink Al.

Al:[Slurred]Keep going...

Ranma-chan:In essence I learned three new arts at once, 
Tae-Kwon Do and Hapkido were required to be learned first, 
but they were easy because it was so similar to Kenpo. 
However, Tuk-gong training was HELL. They beat the shit out 
of me, taught me how to increase my strength by many times,
and most importantly they taught me the purpose of it.

All:[Very curious]Which is?

Ranma-chan: It horrified me that it wasn't a martial art at 
all. All martial arts are meant to defend.  This one was 
actually designed purely to kill or disable. Mostly the former.

John:[Laughs]No wonder you don't let anyone stay alive.

Ranma-chan:[Serious]You're right.[Everyone becomes silent]
It's a deadly art, it took me my entire vacation of my first
year in patrol to learn it. I became so good at it that 
their master couldn't even beat me in a fight after a while.
[Smiles]No one in the battalion cared though, they thought 
it was great that I learned it and hoped that I help people
through it while I'm a cop.

John: That's cool.[Looks at a clock]Jeez, we've been talkin'
and drinkin' for awhile.  It's nearly midnight.

Vince and Al: Yeah.

Ranma-chan:Is it that late? Oh well.[Turns to speak to a big
mean looking man behind the bar]Hey bartender, do you think 
you can give me a bowl of hot water?

[The table was very close to the bar and they were all in a 
corner.  The bartender looks mean and pissed]

Bartender:[Rudely and menacingly]I don't got any so fuck off
you lil' bitch.

Ranma-chan:[Pulls out her Beretta 92FS and turns on the 
laser which is in the guide rod.  The laser is pointed in 
between the bartender's eyes. Ranma makes sure no one else
can see. She has a mad expression on her face and speaks 
quietly] Find some before you find out that lead doesn't 
taste very good fuckhead. You don't look so good. I think you
need a little...[cocks hammer back so bartender can hear it
click]iron, in your diet.

Bartender:[Scared out of his wits] Ye..ye...yes maam.

[Ranma keeps the laser pointed on the bartender's head while
he scrambles for a bowl of hot water.]

Bartender:[Places bowl in front of Ranma-chan. Still 
frightened]Here you go maam...

Ranma-chan:[Puts gun away] Now fuck off.

[The bartender goes to the other side of the bar and 
Ranma-chan splashes her face with some water and turns back
into a guy.]

Ranma: Now lets go.

All: Right

[As they all get up they hear a load yell from a man then 
see him punching a girl in the face.]

Man:[Shouts]You fuckin' bitch! Stop whining! You're mine! 
Get over here bitch, you's comin with me!

[A couple of the guy's friends are laughing at the scene and
do nothing but cheer him on.]

Woman:[Crying in pain]Don't hurt me please![Her nose is 
bleeding badly and she has a purple bruise on her cheek]

Man: Fucking ho![Kicks girl hard on her arm and knocks her
badly]

Woman:[Shrieks]No!!!!!

[The camera pans to Ranma who is mad and yells loudly.]

Ranma:[Furiously] HEY YOU FUCKING PUSSY! WHY DON'T TRY 
BEATING ME DOWN YOU FUCKING FAGGIT! BEATING ON HELPLESS 
WOMEN YOU COCKSUCKER!

Man:[Screams]Fuck you buddy, mind your own fuckin business!

Ranma: Too big of a fuckin' pussy to take me on huh?! Ya 
little bitch?
[Narrows eyes with a grin]I think I'm getting a boner 'cause
I smell pussy!!

[The entire bar laughs out loud at the guy who is now 
steaming red.]

Man:[Pissed]I'll show you!

[The man charges at Ranma who just grabs his arm and breaks
it at the elbow Steven Seagal style.]

Ranma:[Laughs]Pathetic!

Man: Arrgh!!![Clumsily attacks Ranma with a jack knife]

[Ranma just snatches the knife and effortlessly sticks it 
hard right between his eyes while doing a sidewinding kick 
sending him across the room.]

Goon:[Mad]You fucker!

[The man's three friends get up and brandish handguns from 
their pants. Ranma sees this and before they even get a 
chance to aim he whips out his own Beretta and puts three 
round in the center of their chests in one lightning quick 
motion and reholsters his gun like a cowboy twirling it in 
his hand]

Ranma:[Not even bothered with what just happened] You guys 
are a bit too slow! Ha ha!

[The entire bar is in shock and they haven't even screamed 
after they saw what happened. It happened way too fast for
them to comprehend it.  Ranma's friends were just laughing 
away and giving Ranma a thumbs up at the job. He just has 
a bored expression on his face.]

Ranma:[Thinks of what happened here and looks at his letter]
You know what guys? I think I'll take that job at the NSA.

John:[Chuckles]Good call boy.[Yells to the people in the 
bar]It's all right people, we're LAPD, we'll take care of
this.

[Ranma walks to the beaten woman and helps her up]

Woman:[Dazed and too shocked to cry]Wha, what happened?

Ranma:[Grins]Nuthin. I'm Ranma Saotome. Sorry about this.

GuyintheBar:[Shrieks] Oh my god, you just shot up those 
people! You monster! You're supposed to be a cop!

Ranma:[Thinks for a moment, shrugs]But those guys had guns,
would you rather want them shooting you?

GuyintheBar:[Looks nervous]Well...no.

AnonymousWoman:[Accusingly]But you just made fun of them 
after killing them? What the fuck kind of cop are you?

Ranma:[Runs out]It ain't my problem no more!

The Next Day
SIS District Office - Parker Center - Los Angeles,California

March 31st 2001 11:00AM

[The camera opens up to a scene of a busy building surrounded
by uniformed police men and many city officials walking 
around. The camera goes inside the building and shows the 
different divisions of the LAPD Metropolitan Division in 
Parker Center. We see Ranma walking around greeting people
who greet him back. He has a smile on his face and has an 
aura of happiness today.  He heads to a restricted area
where he approaches a door guarded by heavily armed sentries.
They let him in and Ranma heads to a room with Commander
marked on the door and enters.]

Man:[Looks up from folders of papers and photos]Hello 
Sergeant Saotome.

Ranma:[Smiling]Ohayou Captain Davis.

Davis:[Eyes Ranma]It's a little late for good morning. Good
work last week on eliminating that fucker last week. I got
confirmation today from the DA* that we aren't gonna get 
any trouble from his death or the hostages'. However...
[Glares at Ranma]You and John's goon squad pulled a stupid 
stunt yesterday. You didn't have to kill those guys you know.
*DA is the District Attorney

Ranma:[Thinks for a moment, then speaks]I don't know. He 
probably would've recovered and continue to attack innocent
people.

Davis:[Gives up and just chuckles]Whatever. Enough of the 
chatting, what did you come to see me for?

Ranma:[Hands letter from NSA to Davis]I was thinking about
taking this job Captain.

Davis:[Looks at letter in his hand]I see. I remember this 
letter. It seems they want you pretty badly.[Visibly getting
upset, but not mad] You really gonna take it? We sure will 
miss you. You've done a lot more for this city by yourself 
than an entire precinct.

Ranma:[Somber]I know. This job is a great opportunity though,
so that I can go back to Japan again. I miss life there.

Davis:[Thinks to himself while looking Ranma straight in his
eyes]I can't believe this. The cocky asshole who I didn't 
want to even bother with at first is now the person I can't
bear to see leave.[Out loud]Well Saotome, if it means that
much to you I guess you have my permission to go.

Ranma:[Brightens]Really?

Davis:[Smiles slightly] Yes, yes...You're gonna come back 
and at least visit won't you?

Ranma: Of course.

Davis[Looks much brighter]You still have a sense of duty 
even though you won't be with us.[Has a serious face but 
with a smile still]If it ever doesn't work out there remember
that you still have a place with us detectives. OK?

Ranma:[Slightly surprised]Thanks Captain. Hopefully you can
push my resignation so that it will process quick?

Davis:[Shakes his head laughing]You forget who you're 
talking to here? The captain of the dirtiest cops in the
nation.

Ranma:[Laughs]Don't say that Captain.

Davis: Oh yeah, you're gonna be a captain in your new job,
aren't you?

Ranma:[Grins]Yeah, great isn't it? A 25 year old captain? 

Davis:[Shrugs]Suck my nuts.

[Davis makes a few phone calls and about an hour passes.]

Davis:[Puts down phone and sighs]That's it. You're free to 
go. You leaving tomorrow?

Ranma: Yeah. I packed up everything in my apartment and the
movers are taking them out right now. My plane leaves at 
1:30AM.

Davis: So then it's more like you're leaving tonight!

Ranma: Whatever.[Turns sad] I guess we'll see each other
in the future then.[Proudly]It was an honor working with 
you sir.

Davis:[Sadly]Thank you sergeant.[Tries to be serious]Now get
the fuck outta here, go say goodbye to your buddies.

[Ranma exits] 


					*	*	*


[Ranma finds his buddies in the SIS weapon locker.]

Ranma:[Enters locker, curious]What the hell are you guys 
doing?

John: Hey Ranma.[Grabs a rifle from a rack and puts it in a
bag]

Vince:[Is organizing some pistols and ammo]Since we're the 
only group without an assignment, so we get a small vacation. 
We're gonna take all these guns and go buck wild at Elysian
Park.

Al:[Jokingly]Does Mr. Man Among Men want to join us?

Ranma:[Sarcastic]Ha ha. Sorry guys, I can't. I'm leaving for
Japan tonight.

All:.......

Ranma: I know it's quick but that's how it is.

John: Wow, those feds are pretty quick at getting you set up.

Ranma: They're not really feds, the division I get to work 
for is a police group. They already had some professional 
movers at my apartment real quick after I was done packing.
I guess they want me badly. I even got First Class tickets.

Al: I guess you're here to turn in your sidearm then.[Looks 
sad]

Ranma:[Takes out Beretta and badge and stores it in a bin]
Yeah, but I'll get new guns in Japan. I'll probably get the
same one since I still get to keep the holster.

John:[Looks at Beretta]That's the only gun you take home 
with you. No backup or rifle. It's like you're in love with
it.

Vince:[Also sad]I can't believe this. The guy we loved to 
hate is now the guy we can't let go.  Friend or enemy, you 
always are a bastard.[Chuckles]

John:[Hopeful]Can we visit you at least?

Ranma:[Smiles]You don't even have to ask.

Vince: Are you gonna give us a phone number so we can call 
you?

Ranma:[Pulls out a piece of paper]It's funny you know, the 
NSA even lets me choose my own phone number.

John:[Takes number]Thanks.

Al: Wait! We gotta do a going away party for you at least!

Ranma: Sorry, I don't think we'll have the time to do that.
[Everyone looks sad]But when you guys visit me in Japan one 
day, we'll go buck wild then, OK?

All: Hell yeah!!

Ranma:[Exits locker]Bye guys, it was an honor working with 
all of you.

John:[Sternly]Wait Sergeant Saotome.

Ranma:[Confused]Why?

John:[Takes Ranma's badge out of his bin]As the official 
leader of this group, although we know who the real leader
is[winks], you will keep this badge as an honorary gift.
[Places badge in Ranma's hand]It's your earned right to 
have it with you for what you've done for us.[Smiles]

Ranma:[Surprised and moved*]Thank you Lieutenant McClane.
*But still nowhere close to tears, this is Ranma after all!

Vince: Get outta here before we get mushy ya bastard!

Al: Later sergeant.[Shakes Ranma's hand]

Ranma:[Bows]Thank you, all of you.[Leaves locker]

[Ranma exits the locker and leaves the three men to think 
for themselves with memories past.]

John:[Sad]Fuck...

Nippon Airlines 747 Jumbo Jet, Somewhere over the Pacific 
Ocean

April 1st 3:00AM 

[The camera focuses on a jumbo jet soaring at 30,000 ft. 
The camera zooms into a small window near the front of the 
plane where we see Ranma looking out and thinking to 
himself. Inside, his cabin is very luxurious with only 10
other people inside and it is obvious that he's riding 
First Class. He has a very slick outfit on with some nice 
khaki pants and a shirt with a vest. He looks like a very 
handsome detective that one would see in movies.]

Ranma:[Thinking]This ain't bad! The seats go all the way back
and everything!

Stewardess:[Pulls cart in front of Ranma]Would you like 
anything to drink sir?

Ranma: Some sake please.

Stewardess: Certainly.[Hands small cup and bottle to Ranma]

Ranma: Thank you.[Sips warm sake]

[Ranma slowly drinks and thinks to himself about his past 
and everything that he left behind. A series of random 
thoughts and events go through his mind. Thoughts of sadness,
anger, and revelation cycle through his mind]

----------------

<Flashback>

June 28th 1997, Tendo Home

[Ranma has just come home a week after graduating from 
college. He is at the Tendo visit to meet Akane, where she 
breaks some bad news to him.]

Ranma:[Pissed]Dammit Akane! How could you do this to me?!
Why?!

Akane:[Crying]I'm sorry Ranma! I..I..

Ranma: Why?! Why'd you betray me?! I...I... I told you I 
loved you! I wanted to marry you!

[A menacing but strangely calm and serene Ryoga steps in 
front of Akane to face Ranma.]

Ryoga:[Tension in his voice]She was lonely Ranma, that's why
she fell in love with me. It was your fault that you weren't
there for here.[Eyes narrow]You were too busy in that gaijin
college!

Ranma:[Seeing red]You bastard! How could I help it!? I didn't
have time to visit! That's why I worked my butt off to 
graduate UCLA in 3 years! Does that mean nothing to you!
[Throws a punch to Ryoga's face but is way too mad to throw
it well and misses]

Ryoga:[Getting madder]It didn't happen overnight Ranma. Stop
acting like a little girl and face it like a man! Akane is 
in love with me!!

[Ranma looks desperately in Akane's eyes to see if this is 
really true]

Akane:[Sadly]It's true. I still do love you Ranma, but only 
as a friend. Like he said, this didn't happen overnight.
[Painful expression crosses her face for a moment]Ryoga 
helped me out at some bad times, and he's been real 
supportive of me. I love him very much. We're gonna get
married eventually, but not anytime soon.

Ranma:[Looks at ground in disbelief]No.... 

Ryoga:[Triumphantly]Yes.

[Ranma gets a nasty look in his eyes then grabs Ryoga by
surprise and throws him into the koi pond.]

Ranma:[Thinks]I got you now P-chan.

Akane:[Mad]What was the point of that?!

Ranma:[Confused]Wha..

[He's cut off as Ryoga emerges from the pool still human and
with a smile. Ranma's eyes go very wide and stares in 
disbelief. Ryoga comes up to him and spits water at his face.

Ryoga:[Smiling]If you're gonna act like a girl, you might as
well be one, RANKO!

Ranma-chan:[Not comprehending what just happened]What the 
hell?

[Ryoga and Akane are staring at Ranma-chan for the first 
time in his girl form since he came back from the U.S.]

Akane:[Shocked]Ranma, why didn't you become smaller as a 
girl? You look like a six-foot model!

[Ranma did indeed look a lot better, she was the same height
as her male form, only with a smaller frame.  She was a lot
curvier and looked much more beautiful and seductive. She 
would probably shame Ms. Hinako with her beauty.

Ranma: I realized that my cursed form was still growing. It
grew into a much more adult body. I called Cologne once to 
ask about it and surprisingly she told me that my cursed form
would remain young and adult for the rest of my life.

[In that moment Soun and Genma pop out after hearing some 
info from Nabiki and anarchy rains down as everyone is in 
an argument over Akane's decision and the future of the 
Saotome-Tendo dojo. Apparently the two parents somehow had 
no idea about the relationship between Akane and Ryoga.]

<End Flashback>

----------------

Present

[Ranma is still in a plane thinking. He shivers at that 
unpleasant memory.]

Ranma:[Thinks]Fuckin' Ryoga. 

[Ranma reads some onboard flight equipment given to First 
Class fliers. He reads a panel and sees that he still has 3
and a half hours to go before arriving at Tokyo.]

Ranma:[Thinks]I wonder what people will think when they see
how much I've changed.

----------------

<Flashback>

July 20th 1997, Saotome Home, Nerima

[Ranma is getting off the phone and heads to the living room
to talk to his mother. His old man Genma is watching TV 
lazing around]

Genma:[Sees his son]Boy, you make your father shameful. You 
can't even find a job as a sensei let alone keeping a 
fiancée. Aren't you shamed of him Nodoka?

Ranma:[Kicks dad in the ribs]Shut up you lazy old fart.

Nodoka:[Frowns at Genma]Don't mind him son. What's on your
mind?

[After a week of pining over the loss of Akane, Ranma 
decides to do anything to keep his mind off of her. He 
searched for a job as a dojo sensei but came up unsuccessful.
One thing had come up in his mind the other day though.]

Ranma:[Serious]Mom, I want to be a police officer.

Nodoka:[Surprised]In Nerima?

Ranma: No.

Nodoka: Oh, somewhere else in Japan?

Ranma: No. Let me explain.[Breathes deeply and exhales]When
I was at UCLA I had Physical Education as a minor degree. 
But I was really interested with the study of Criminal Law*
You see, when I lived in LA I joined the U.S. Reserve 
Officer Training Corps so that you and oyaji wouldn't have
to pay for my education. It gave a lot of benefits.

*I know this is far fetched, but why not? It has to do with
helping the innocent and punishing the bad. It could happen,
couldn't it?

Nodoka:[Smiles]That was thoughtful of you.

Ranma:[Pulls out an envelope]Right after I graduated UCLA, 
the Los Angeles Police Department sent me a letter asking if
I was interested in becoming a police officer. I didn't 
reply back until today. Next week I'm heading to Elysian 
Park, Los Angeles to start training.

Genma:[Scowling]Shame on you boy! Turning back on martial 
arts! How is it possible an idiot like you can get accepted 
that easily into a police academy?

Ranma:[Glaring at his father]For your information, I was 
very well educated in college and I did a lot of things in 
my spare time to become a better person. [Shouts]And I 
didn't turn my back on martial arts! I was the president of
the martial arts club in college! I practiced everyday! I 
can beat you now without even trying! I could probably take
on Happosai maybe!

Nodoka:[Takes out her katana and has it near Genma's neck]
You should be proud of your son husband. He is much more 
honorable now than you, master, and Tendo-san combined.
[Resheaths katana when Genma shuts up]We're both very proud
of you Ranma. Being a police officer is very honorable, 
especially that department.

Ranma:[Surprised by his mom's words, smiles]Arigato 
gozaimasu okaasan.

Nodoka: However, you must swear on your honor that you will
still carry on your family's art and practice it so that you
may pass it on.

Ranma:[Cockily]Of course.

Nodoka: I really am proud of you son. It's a shame about 
Akane, I'm sorry about that, but it really isn't your fault.
As honor bound as I may be, I understand what happened. Love
is a very fickle thing. 

Ranma:[Head down]Yeah.

Genma:[Exasperating]Stop pampering the boy.

Nodoka and Ranma: Shut up!

Ranma: I'll be leaving in a couple days. Can you tell 
everyone else about where I'm going for me?

Nodoka: Of course my son.

Ranma:[Smiles]Arigatou okaasan.

<End Flashback>

-----------------

[Ranma is now asleep in the plane and is dreaming of 
something. The panel reads that the plane has only an hour
and a half left till arrival.]

Ranma:[Mumbling in his sleep]Backup..I need backup...help...

[Ranma is tossing and turning and his face is going through
different painful expressions.]

---------------

<Flashback>

March 22nd, 1998  Hollywood Division, Los Angeles  3:25 PM

[The camera opens up to a scene of a war zone, with three 
squad cars blocking a street and a Cadillac across from it.
There are 5 officers, but 4 of them are down and only 1 is 
still able to fight. We see that it is Ranma in a patrol 
uniform but his shirt is torn at his chest.  He is holding
someone in his arms who is bleeding profusely.]

Ranma:[Yelling through his radio]Officers down! Officers 
down! This is 6-Mary-42 at the eastern section of Sunset 
and Melrose! I need backup! Backup goddammit! SOMEBODY HELP
ME!

[On the other side of the street in the Cadillac 5 gangsters
are shooting at Ranma with cheap sub-machine guns.  Ranma is
desperately hiding behind his car leaning against a bullet
proof door that is falling apart. He is trying to save his
partner's life.]

Gangster1:[Shooting wildly]Die you fuckin' pigs!!

Ranma:[Still blaring at his radio]Dammit dispatch where the 
fuck is my backup!

Dispatch: Officers are on the way. ETA 2 minutes hang on.

Ranma:[In rage]I won't be here in another 2 minutes!!! Tell
them to get here fas--..[Ranma is hit in the back about 6 
times, but the bullets don't penetrate his vest. He screams
in pain]Aaahhh! Fuck!!! Shit!![Drops his partner in pain, 
who is now dead from bullet wounds to the side where there
is no armor.]

Gangster2:[Cheering and whooping]I think we got him!!

[They all stop shooting and cheer, then empty their guns in
the air]

Ranma:[On the ground ripping his vest off of him]Ow![Thinks]
Only a couple months on the job and already in a shootout. 
Shit! That's 9 times I've been shot,3 in the front and 6 in
the back! Good thing they're shootin' 9mm's, or I'd be a 
goner![Notices that the gangsters are stupidly shooting in 
the air]An opening! Now's my chance to fight back!

[Ranma pops up with his Beretta drawn and scopes out his 
view. He sees 5 armed men scattered around about 20 yards 
from him. Without thinking he pops a bullet in all their 
heads in a lightning quick motion. The shots are dead on 
accurate, and Ranma is too busy running over to make sure 
if they're dead. One officer who was on the ground but unable
to fight sees everything and doesn't believe what he's just
seen.]

WoundedCop:[Croaks in pain]Holy shit...That how the hell did
he do that...

[Minutes later a stampede of ambulances, fire trucks, and 
police cars arrive on the scene with the media hot on their
tails. Ranma is treated for the various bruises he has on 
his chest and back. The medic who helps him is an old man 
with dull brown eyes that seem to have seen too much.]

Medic:[Calm and soothing voice]It's amazing what you did 
here buddy. It's a miracle you survived.[Points to a 
shredded bulletproof vest]That thing saved your life.

Ranma:[Traumatized]I..I killed those guys back there...

Medic:[Trying to relieve Ranma]They got what was coming to
them.

Ranma:[Stuttering]Bu..but now I'm a killer!

Medic:[Stern]No. You're a hero. 2 officers had their lives
saved because of you. What you did was give justice.

Ranma: But my partner is dead! I let him die!

Medic: You didn't kill him. He probably knew what he was 
getting in to. That's what a police officer is about. It 
means laying down your life to protect the innocent. You did
your job. To protect and serve.

Ranma:......

Medic:[Comforting voice]Don't worry. This happens to all 
cops who kill their first suspect. You'll get some help 
from a shrink if you want. But remember that no matter what
happens, none of this is your fault. You did something truly
brave and noble.

Ranma:[Somewhat relieved]Thank you sir.

Medic:[Gets up to leave]You're all patched up now. I'm gonna
help some others now. Good day.

[As the medic leaves another person in a heavy uniform with
flash grenades on the chest and a huge shotgun approaches 
Ranma.]

Ranma: Who are you?

Man: I'm Lieutenant Stevens. I'm from the Metropolitan 
Division.

Ranma:[Notices an eagle patch at his side with some big 
letters]You're from SWAT?

Stevens: Yeah. I'm the commanding officer.

Ranma: What do you want from me sir?

Stevens: I was looking over the short report you gave, and I
find something hard to believe. Did you really shoot those 
guys in the head all by yourself?

Ranma:[Confused]Yeah, I did?[Scared*]What's wrong sir?
*Hey, even Ranma can get scared right? He just shot and 
killed 5 people right now, even he can't handle that lightly!

Stevens:[Surprised]Amazing. From the looks of everything I
can't say that you're lying either. Are you a crack shot?

Ranma:[Tense]Yes, I was the best shooter in my class at the
academy.

Stevens: That still doesn't explain how you're so skilled. 
Tell you what. Come to Parker Center tomorrow at 2PM, so we
can talk some more alright? Come to the Special Ops and 
Tactics division.

Ranma: Can I do that?

Stevens: It is mandatory.

Ranma:......

[Stevens walks away, but right before he leaves out of sight
he turns to Ranma]

Steven: By the way, this doesn't mean you are being recruited
for the SWAT team. [Lifts an eyebrow]Remember that.

[Ranma stares at the man and just shrugs, and looks back at
the war zone in front of him. Dead bodies are everywhere, 
bullet holes are riddled in the squad cars, and the smell of
gunpowder is floating in the air. It was all too much for 
Ranma, who just gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and 
opened them. At that moment a revelation appeared in front
of him.]

Ranma:[Shocked, quietly]Well I'll be damned.

[It happened that a bunch of children were having a field 
trip walking along Sunset Boulevard* to look at the sites. 
The teacher was apparently shot in the leg by accident in 
the crossfire, but she was ok and there were no injuries 
among the kids.]
*Ok, for you people who live near LA or have seen the Sunset
strip you know that this would never happen. That place is a
land of hookers and druggies, but for this lets just say it
happened, Hmm? ;)

Ranma:[Thinking]I saved those kids and that teacher from 
getting killed...
[Smiles]Killing 5 ruthless criminals to save 20 school kids...

[Ranma who was actually thinking at that moment of quitting 
his job, stopped, and reflected to himself for a moment.]

Ranma:[Looking at a logo on a police car]To protect and 
serve. Just like a martial artist, laying down your life 
to save the weak and innocent. To protect and serve. I guess
this wasn't that bad after all.

Officer:[Walks up to Ranma and looks at him amusingly]Dude!
You just wasted five people just like that![Snaps fingers 
for effect]That's totally killer! You's a helluva good 
fucking shot!

Ranma:[Crashes back to the reality of the shooting scene]Oh
my god...[Goes to the side of the road and vomits]I'm a 
killer...

Officer:[Nervous, sweatdrops]Whoa, I didn't fuckin' mean to
say you're a killer...

Ranma:[Shakes involuntarily]I gotta get outta here...

[Ranma walks off and gets into a police car where he is 
escorted to a police station. He is staring out the window 
deep in thought and shivers. The camera zooms out showing 
the car slowly disappear and showing a great aerial view of
Hollywood.]

<End of Scene, Time passes and Ranma is seen in different 
police precincts with various assignments. He kills many 
criminals, is shown training in various places, and it shows
Ranma getting the Medal of Valor at a ceremony>

June 6, 2000  Rampart Detectives Unit, Los Angeles

[Outside it is raining heavily and police sirens and various
screams and outbursts can be heard downstairs. The camera 
goes into a room marked Detectives Unit. Ranma-chan is 
sitting at a desk busily going through some paper work when
his phone rings.]

Ranma-chan:[Struggling to keep earpiece in place while 
writing things down]This is sergeant Saotome, Rampart 
Robbery-Homicide.

Voice: Hello detective. How are you?

Ranma-chan:[Frustrated]Listen buddy I'm really busy right
now so if you've got something important say it.

Voice:[Laughing]Just the kind of behavior I expected. I'm 
Captain Davis from the Metropolitan Division.

Ranma-chan:[Nervously chuckles]Heh,heh, sorry about that sir,
I was filing a report on 4 dead suspects, I was a little
busy.

Davis: Don't worry about it. Are they suspects that you 
killed?

Ranma-chan:[Nervous]Yes...

Davis: You are a very interesting officer Saotome. I've read
the case file on you. 3 years on the job and you've made 
nearly 350 busts.  You've killed nearly 140 criminals, all 
legitimate, marksmanship status given by SWAT, advanced 
martial arts, and you were made Sergeant after only 3 years*?
I'm impressed. Not to mention your Jusenkyo curse.
*In real life, no matter how good you are this will never 
happen. It takes 4 years at LEAST to be a sergeant.

Ranma-chan:[Curious]What is it that you want?

Davis: I head a unit in the Special Ops and Tactics sector
called the Special Investigative Squad.  We are a group 
dedicated to bringing down hardcore criminals that regular 
cops can't handle. We're composed of only twenty officers, 
but they're all one in a million. Sergeant, I'm giving you 
the opportunity, to do more than you ever could as a homicide
detective. As an SIS detective, you can save the lives of 
more people than you ever can as a regular cop. With it comes
the prestige of being part of the best. Although they won't
admit it, we are above SWAT in operational priority. Bottom
line, we kill bad guys so they won't be back for more.

Ranma-chan:[Narrows eyes]I know what you guys are. You're 
pretty infamous for being a death squad, killing criminals
on purpose instead of arresting them.

Davis:[Unnerved by Ranma's response]That's pretty much it.
Best of all, there's no paperwork![Chuckles]

Ranma-chan:[Unimpressed]Give me a reason why I should join
asshole.

Davis:[Serious]Let me ask you something. There are a lot of
fuckers out there who rob banks, steal, or sell drugs on the
street. How about those nuts who prowl at night to rape 
women? Kill kids for joy? Murder for fun? What is that hmm?
I know, just by looking at your file that you are a MAN of 
justice, helping the innocent and laying your life down for
them. To protect and serve. That's what we do. We protect 
the innocent by doing the dirty jobs that no one else can 
handle.

Ranma-chan:[Intrigued]Hmm... How about we talk about this
face to face? Tomorrow maybe?

Davis: Sure.

Ranma-chan: Where shall we meet?

Davis: Elysian Park. Near the shooting range. Tomorrow at 
4PM.

Ranma-chan: I'll see you then.

[Ranma-chan hangs up the phone and leans back in her chair.
she lifts up her left hand and looks at the blood stained on
it. She hadn't even bothered to clean her hands after her 
bust an hour ago. She just makes a fist and her hand glows
with dark blue ki, and it's burning something but doesn't
hurt her at all. She opens her fist again and the blood is
gone.]

Ranma-chan: Ah hell. Why the fuck not? I guess I can take a
chance at something new.[Shrugs and goes back to filling 
paperwork]

<End Flashback>

<From this point on, all conversation between people are in
Japanese>

Tokyo International Airport

April 2nd, 2001 6:30AM

[Ranma has one large suitcase with him and is walking around
to go outside of the terminal. He sees some American SUVs 
with police lights attached to them waiting outside in an 
escort convoy. An old Japanese man in a very expensive suit
with armed guards around him is waiting anxiously at the exit
for someone.]

Ranma:[Tired]Gods, this place if fucking crowded, even in the
morning.[Spots police trucks]I wonder if that's for me?

Man:[Cheerfully]Ohayou Saotome-san.

Ranma: Ohayou.

Man: We've been expecting you. Please come with me in the 
SUV.

Ranma: Domo Arigatou.

Man: I'm Commissioner Takayama. I'm very pleased to meet you
Saotome-san.

Ranma: Thank you Takayama-san. Please call me Ranma.

Takayama:[Smiling]Very well. We're heading to our main 
building in the outskirts of Tokyo. We have the vehicle you
requested there along with a selection of weapons for you to
choose from. Did you enjoy the flight here Ranma?

Ranma: Yes I did, thank you.

Takayama: We're really excited to have you with us. It is 
very rare for us to find Japanese agents of your caliber. 
Our division is referred to as MaxFor, for Maximum 
Enforcement. But we prefer that you refer to yourself as 
an NSA officer.

Ranma:[Chuckles]Of course.

[Time passes, and the convoy arrives at the JNSA. Ranma is
led to a computer lab.]

Takayama:[Points to a fingerprint and eye scanning machine]
Please register yourself with those machines so that we may
make an ID for you.

[Ranma walks over and uses the machine, which input various

which spit out an ID card for Ranma.]

Ranma: Sugoi! That's pretty neat!

Takayama: You'll want this too.[Hands Ranma a golden shield 
badge with a small eagle on it. The inscription on top says 
Captain, and in the middle has his badge number, and name. 
The eagle bores a multicolored crest of the JNSA]

Ranma:[Looks at the badge in his hand]Captain Saotome... I
like the sound of that.

Takayama: Now you must choose your weaponry.[Leads Ranma 
into a huge heavily guarded weapon locker]

Ranma:[Overwhelmed]Wow!! I can have anything I want?

Takayama: Anything within reason.

Ranma: Alright.[Cracks knuckles and thinks]I'll need a 
Beretta 92FS Inox with a super match grade barrel, with a 
laser rod guide, Novak Nite-Sites, and 6 spare 15 round 
clips. I need a Sig Sauer P226 9mm with the same

Koch G36K with ten 30 round box magazines and 5 100 round 
drums. Put in a light machine gun conversion kit with it. 
And last I need a Heckler and Koch MSG-90 sniper rifle 
fitted with a Hensoldt scope with ten 20 round magazines.  

Takayama:[Busy writing it all down]You certainly know your
stuff don't you Ranma?

Ranma:[Shrugs]When you're a cop you find yourself learning 
these things someway.

Takayama: Anything else?

Ranma:[Thinks, then remembers something]Yeah, make sure all
the barrels on all those guns are threaded, and give me 
suppressors* for all of them.
*Silencers, those cans you sometimes see in movies that 
muffle the noise of guns.

Takayama: No problem.

Ranma: Jeez, all this stuff must cost a fortune!

Takayama: You forget how rich this country is! We extort 
lots of money from big companies![Laughs]Besides, we're one
of only 6 units in Japan who are allowed to carry firearms 
on a regular basis. This unit happens to have no limit on 
what you can carry.

Ranma:[Understandingly]Oh...

Takayama: If you give me about 15 mins I can get all of this
for you. Oh, by the way the car you requested is in the 
garage.

Ranma:[Eyes wide with a smile just as big]Really? You 
actually got it?

Takayama: Of course.[Shakes his head]Brand spanking new, 
with all the mods you asked for.

Ranma: Yatta!

[The scene fades as both walk out of the locker and head for
the garage. They look at a clock and see that it is now 
11:00 AM]

Ranma:[Looking at the car with eager eyes]Whoo! I love it!

Takayama:[Reads off of a piece of paper]A 2001 Chevy Tahoe 
LT 4x4 with police suspension, xenon lights, internal siren
and emergency lights, matte black wheels, bulletproof armor,
satellite radio and phone, and a supercharged 420 horsepower
5300cc V8 engine. What you wanted right?

Ranma:[Happy]Sweeeet! And it looks like a blacked out cruiser,
not a squad car.
Where's the keys?

Takayama:[Throws 3 sets of keys with remotes]All yours. Now
remember you have only 1 week instead of one month to decide 
on a location to live. Some difficulties came up and we need
you to run the unit operations.

Ranma: Right. About the weapons, did you get the ammo I
requested?

Takayama: Yeah they're all coming right now.[A cart pulls up
next to him]
They're all loaded up with what you wanted. I got the 
holsters too.

Ranma: Arigatou.[Ranma holsters up 2 pistols on him, one at 
his hip and another safely holstered at the back of his 
beltline. He puts the rifle in the back of the SUV.]

Takayama: So, where you heading for now?

Ranma:[Smiles]Nerima.

Takayama: Ah, to meet your parents? What a faithful son. 
You'll be needing this.[Throws Ranma a small object]

Ranma:[Lifts an eyebrow and catches it]A cell phone? Thanks,
it's just the right size too.

Takayama:[Smirks]Heh, it's a phone/GPS/Radio. It has all the
phone numbers you need permanently stored there, and the 
number for it is XXX-XXX-XXXX. It never needs to be 
recharged, it has a weird battery. Your Chevy has it too,
so that you'll never have any problems.

Ranma: Thank you. I think I'll get out of here now.[Starts
Chevy and revs it hard, emitting a deep seductive V8 growl]

Takayama:[Waves]Have fun! I'll contact you or vice versa!

[Ranma only smiles and peels out of the garage leaving a 
cloud of smoke. He dials on his phone to call home.]

Ranma:[Thinks]I haven't even once told okaasan that I would
be returning to Japan. How thoughtless of me...

Phone: Moshi-moshi?

Ranma: Okaasan!

Nodoka: Ranma! How nice of you to call home! How are you!

Ranma: I'm fine! Guess what? I'm in Japan right now!

Nodoka:[Surprised]REALLY?

Ranma: Yeah! Sorry about the late notice, but can I come 
visit you right now?

Nodoka:[Excited]Of course son! Genma! Ranma is coming home!
[In the background Ranma's father can be heard]Your dad is 
glad you're coming too.

Ranma: I'll be there in about 30 minutes. See you soon![Cuts
phone connection]

[As soon as the phone goes off it rings and Ranma answers.]

Ranma: Moshi-moshi?

Takayama: Hey Ranma. Sorry but I forgot to tell you a couple
details about your authority.

Ranma: Oh. Go ahead.

Takayama: You're basically in charge of every police officer
you encounter in Japan and you supercede up to military 
colonels in the ranking game.

Ranma: Wow, so this unit is more nationally based?

Takayama: Somewhat. Your work is a very sensitive matter 
that you should probably be already used to.

Ranma:[Laughs]Yeah.

Takayama: Just remember this...[Continues on indistinct and
scene switches]


					*	*	*


[Ranma drives through Tokyo to get to Nerima and goes a 
little too fast for the speed limit. However his years of
pursuit driving has given him as razor sharp edge in fast 
driving, with reflexes and skill that would put most race 
car drivers to shame.]

Ranma:[Relaxing himself]I love this car.

[Soon Ranma arrives in front of the small Saotome home. 
Many onlookers are staring at the stunning and huge black
SUV parked in front. It would make any small Japanese car 
shameful. Ranma honks twice and turns on the police siren 
in short spurts. Nodoka and Genma go outside to see where 
the police car was only to find their son in front of them
standing proudly. He had worn his new and sleek badge on 
his belt on the left side.]

Nodoka: Ranma?

Ranma: Its me okaasan.[Smiles]

Nodoka: Oh my...[Has a huge smile]I can't believe how manly
you've become!

Genma:[Stunned]Is this big truck here yours?

Ranma: Yep.

Nodoka: What are you doing here son?

Genma: Yeah, what are you doing here boy? Taking a vacation?

Ranma:[Sheepishly]I forgot to tell you guys, but I'm moving
back to Japan. I was offered a job with the Japanese 
National Security Agency, a really good one, and I took it.
I'm a CAPTAIN now, oyaji. Not a SERGEANT. A big bad CAPTAIN!

Nodoka and Genma:[Surprised]A CAPTAIN?!

Ranma:[Smiles]Yeah, and I get a great salary, a free car
[Points to Chevy], a free home, and a powerful job.

Nodoka: I'm so proud of you son![Tears in her eyes]You bring
more honor to this family than any of your ancestors 
combined![Hugs Ranma] Come inside dear, let's have some tea.

[The family walks into their home while the onlookers gaze 
enviously at the boy with who owns the stunning truck.]

Genma:[Notices Beretta at Ranma's side]Is that a gun boy?

Ranma: Yeah.[Pulls it out and shows it off]I get special 
authority to carry weapons around with me all the time.
[Reholsters pistol]

Genma: I'm disappointed in you![Shakes head] Resorting to 
using such a dishonorable tool!

Ranma:[Annoyed]Hey oyaji, I'd like to see you handle 10 guys
with machine guys with your martial arts skill!

Genma:[Looks nervous]Fine, you are forgiven there, but I 
bet your skill has gone down?[Laughs]

Ranma:[Serious but friendly look]I will bet everything I 
have that I can take you down in less than 5 seconds.

Genma:[Bursts into loud laughter]Great joke son! Great humor!
I thinks that's the only thing that got better with you!

Ranma:[Smirks evilly]Pop, I have 5,000,000 yen in my bank 
account that I have saved for the past 4 years. If I can't
beat you in 5 seconds, it's all yours.

Genma:[Without even thinking]DEAL!

Nodoka:[Comes to them with some tea]I'd like to see this. 
I have confidence in you son.

Genma:[Cackling]5 million yen! All mine!

Ranma:[Annoyed] Shut up and fight.

Nodoka:[Leads them all into the backyard]You'll fight here.
I'll start it off. Fight!

Genma:[Charges]Kyaa!!

[Ranma grabs his arm, twists and lifts and kicks Genma in 3
parts of his torso in less than 2 seconds rendering Genma 
unconscious.]

Ranma:[Laughs]Pathetic.

Nodoka:[Too shocked for words]......

Ranma: Might as well revive you.[Hits a couple of pressure 
points on Genma who wakes up]

Genma:[Dazed]What happened?

Ranma:[Grinning]I grabbed your arm when you charged and 
kicked you in 3 pressure point on your torso. You went out 
immediately.

Genma:[Mad]I was going easy on you!

Ranma:[Bored]You can fight more if you want but you lost 
your chance at getting my money.

Genma:[Pissed]Arrghh!![Swings a kick at Ranma's face as hard
as he can]

[Ranma doesn't even bother to move and just takes the hit.
Genma goes in shock, thinking that Ranma would avoid the 
kick, but is surprised when Ranma looks fine]

Ranma:[Laughs]Your strongest kick couldn't possibly hurt me.

Genma:[Shocked]How is this possible?!

Ranma:[Cockily]I told you I didn't go soft on my training! 
When I was in LA I met some Korean guys who taught me the
art of Tuk-gong Moo-sul. Some parts of it are truly 
horrifying but it is extraordinarily effective and powerful.
I decided to incorporate it with our family art.

Nodoka:[Regains her senses]That's wonderful Ranma! I've 
never seen anything like it! It's so powerful.

Ranma: Yeah. Next time I see the old hag or the old perv 
I'm gonna surprise 'em GOOD.

Genma: I'll get you back somehow.[Sly voice]We'll start 
training again real soon.

Ranma: I don't know Pop, Nerima might not be the place I 
want to be, but I won't live far from here either.

Nodoka: How thoughtful of you.

Genma: Maybe you can get married to another of Tendo's 
daughters huh?[Laughs then stops]

Ranma:[Icy glare] Don't ever say that again. From now on, 
I choose what I do with my own life, is that understood 
OTOUSAN?

Genma:[Nervously]No problem...

[Time Passes and it is now 2:00 PM. Ranma has changed into 
his trademark red silk shirt and black pants. But we see 
they are slightly modified, inside the ring of his 
drawstring there is also an internal belt for his gun 
holsters and badge.]

Ranma: Mom, Pop, if you don't mind I want to visit Ucchan.

Nodoka: Why don't you visit Akane, Ranma?

Ranma:[Speechless]...... There are still some scars that 
I'm still not over mom. I was hoping to avoid her for a 
while. But I'll talk to her sooner or later.

Nodoka:[Sadly]I'm sorry about that son. I know what it feels
like to be heartbroken.

Genma:[Guilty]I'm sorry too son. Even I can be a fool 
sometimes...*
*Genma is still an idiot, but not a heartless one I don't 
think. Ranma IS his child.

Ranma:[Surprised by Genma]Thanks Pop, that means a lot coming
from you.

Genma:[Tries to be serious]Don't get all mushy. You have to
be manly.

Ranma:[Gets up to leave]Yeah, whatever.

Nodoka: Bye dear, I'll see you later!

Ranma: Bye mom.

[Ranma heads to the genkan and puts on his sneakers*. 
Before he leaves he calls his old man over.]
*Ranma has changed his shoes to something more appropriate
for running and casual dressing over the years.

Genma: What do you want?

Ranma:[Whispers]Shh...[Takes out an envelope and puts in his
dad's hands]Despite how greedy you were ever since I've known
you, this is a gift for you. 

Genma:[Curious]For me? What is it?

Ranma: It's not just for you, it's for mom too. It's 2 
million yen in your names.

Genma:[Excited]Whoo--....[Mouth covered by Ranma's hand]

Ranma: Quiet you! Half is for you and half is for mom. I 
made sure so that you can't take it all. Her signature and
word is needed to deposit this. When you deposit yours I want
you to give mom a nice evening and take her out.

Genma:[Eyes son]Why are you doing this?

Ranma: It's because you two are my parents. And it's my way
of making up not visiting you guys for 4 years.

Genma:[Thinks hard to himself, and actually feels touched]
Thanks son. I guess you aren't that ungrateful.

Ranma:[Chuckles]Baka. No go have some fun and show mom a 
good time tonight.

[Genma runs into the living room to Nodoka while Ranma 
exits to his Chevy.]

					*	*	*


[The camera focuses on Ranma cruising on the streets of 
Nerima heading to Ucchan's Okonomiyaki.  He is listening to
 some news on the radio.]

NewsRadio: Today's top story is the return of the American 
spy plane pilots who returned from their imprisonment in 
China. They were greeted today at Whidbey Island where they
were crowned as heroes.

Ranma:[Turns off radio in annoyance]What the fuck kind of 
stupid shit is that? Becoming heroes for what? They didn't 
do anything heroic for their nation.[Sighs, and thinks to 
himself]I can't believe I conversed for two straight days 
without cussing at something or somebody. I must've changed
a lot since I've came back to Nerima.

[The Chevy arrives in front of a fairly large restaurant on
a street crowded with various small businesses. Before he 
gets out Ranma revs the engine real good just for the hell 
of it, catching the attention of many impressed people on 
the street.]

Ranma:[In his own state of bliss]I love gaijin cars...

[Ranma walks into the Ucchan and notices that it's not very
busy and the place is moderately packed. He just stands in 
front of a sign that tells patrons to wait to be served.]

Ranma:[Thinks]Wow, Ucchan sure has gone a long way in this
place, this place is big! I wonder how many employees there
are here?

Woman:[Scurries to the entrance to serve Ranma]Irrashaimase!
Please choose any seat you wish sir![Looks up and gasps in 
surprise]Ranchan!

Ranma:[Smiles]Ucchan! How you been?

Ukyo:[Surprised]I can't believe it! How long has it been? 
4 or 5 years?[Hugs him tightly]Come with me! Everyone is 
here celebrating! What a coincidence huh?

Ranma:[Frowns and gets nervous]Everybody? As in the old 
ghoul and Shampoo?

Ukyo: Uh huh! Even Happosai's here, he agreed to be nice as 
long as he got to join us!

Ranma:[Quietly]Even Akane and Ryoga?

Ukyo:[Doesn't notice Ranma's tone]Yup.[Drags him before he 
can do anything]Come on!

Ranma:[Nervous]Uh, Ucchan, I don't think this is a good idea...

[They enter a private room in the restaurant where there is
a huge table seated with all of the people from Ranma's 
past. From Soun to Kasumi, from Tofu to Kuno, Cologne and 
Mouse, everybody. The only person who didn't seem to be 
there was Kodachi. Ranma however just realizes how much 
bigger Ukyo's restaurant is and how much it expanded.]

Ukyo:[Excited]Hey guys! Ranma's back! It's Ranma!

[The entire table turns and stares at Ranma, and Ukyo joins 
as well. Ukyo notices what everybody is staring at. He was 
wearing the same clothes, had the same face, the same hair, 
but he was a different person in soul. His posture was 
different, his eyes were piercing blue, not bright. What 
struck everyone the most was his aura though. It wasn't the 
flowing blue that always emanated, but it was a concentrated 
white, to the people who could feel it.]

Ranma:[Tries to be friendly]Hey.

[They continue to stare at him, his gun was slightly showing
and his badge was shining for all the world to see. Finally
someone managed to speak.]

Shampoo: Ranma, is that you?

Ranma: Yeah, it is. What's everybody doing here?

Akane:[Bravely but shyly]We're here to just have a get 
together and party. Everyone was invited. Even Kuno.

Kuno: So, the vile Saotome shows his face here 
again. Pitiful cur. Have you released the beauticious 
Pig-Tailed Girl yet? Or is she still your slave?

[Ranma just gave him a menacing glare that caused him to
flinch.]

Kasumi:[Cheery as usual]How have you been Ranma-kun?

Ranma:[Brightens]I'm fine Kasumi. Have a great job and I do 
a lot to help people.

Happosai:[Face full of food]Ah, Ranma-chan! You're back! 
You gonna let your old master get a good feeling of ya as a
welcoming present?

Ranma:[Face of disbelief]For crying out loud, will you ever 
change?

Happosai:[Throws a cup of water at Ranma]Come to papa![Leaps]

Ranma:[Dodges water]Hentai![Punts Happosai out of the 
restaurant]

Ryoga:[Mad]What are you doing here Ranma?

Ranma:[Getting mad]I don't live in LA anymore. I quit my job
at the LAPD. I had the opportunity to have a high ranking 
job here and I took it. 

Tofu: When did this all happen?

Ranma:[Thinks and speaks]It all happened real fast and 
recently. I got a good job offer here and I felt like 
returning to Japan. I still can have a job back in LA but
I felt like reliving a Japanese life again for old times 
sake.

Nabiki:[Sarcastic] Well, well, well. What are you now, 
commander of patrol officers in Nerima?

[Everyone laughs, but Ranma's blood boils. He doesn't show
his anger.]

Ranma:[Serious]I'm a Captain of the Japanese National 
Security Agency's Public Safety Commission's Maximum 
Enforcement Unit. I have direct authority over every law
enforcement figure in the National Police and every figure
underneath the rank of General in the military. [Edge in
voice]For your information I could pretty much do whatever
the hell I want. The Supreme Courts themselves wouldn't be
able to do anything about it.[Thinks]Damn I wish I could 
cuss. I can't take this shit.

[Everyone was dead silent at his voice. Everyone except 
Ryoga.]

Ryoga:[Pissed]Just who do you think you are? Barging in here,
ruining our fun?

Ranma:[Trying to stay calm]I didn't' barge in here. I came 
here to meet Ucchan. And how did I ruin your fun huh? Jeez,
P-Chan, I'm here for five minutes and you're already 
starting a fight with me.

Akane:[Getting mad]Come on Ryo-chan, leave him alone.

Ranma: Ryo-chan?

Akane:[Glares at him]We got married a couple months ago. I 
sent you an invitation to come, not that we expected you, 
but daddy made me.

Ranma:[Smirks]I did get it you kawaikune tomboy, except I 
took it to a furnace and let it burn to hell.

[Akane is taken aback and gets a mean look in her eyes. Ryoga
looks furious.]

Ryoga:[Tauntingly]Get outta here RANKO! Nobody wants you 
here. If you're gonna act like a girl[Picks up a glass of 
water]you might as well be one![Throws water at his face]

[Ranma just raises his hand lightning quick and lets off
strong ki as the water touches his hand. The water just 
evaporates into vapor. Cologne and several others just look
shocked.]

Cologne:[Shocked]How...how did you do that son-in-law?

Ranma:[Looks very upset]I did a lot in the past 4 years. I 
only came here to chat with Ucchan. Not to bother any of you.
And don't call me that you old ghoul.

Cologne:[Narrows eyes]Whether you like it or not, you will be
Shampoo's groom one day!

Shampoo: That right! Ranma be Shampoo's husband!

Mousse:[Mad]No, Shampoo's mine.

Cologne:[Nods]Yes, muko-dono. The only reason why we let you
alone at college was so that you could be more skillful and
educated. Valuable to our tribe of Amazons.[Glares at Ranma]
And the fact that it was too hard to locate you with your 
job as a lawman.

Ranma:[Visibly mad, gritting teeth. Thinks]I can't take this
shit any longer!

Kuno:[Lifts head cockily at Ranma]Do you still hold the 
beauticious pig-tailed girl captive you sorcerer? I will 
defeat you somehow, fiend.

Ryoga:[Triumphantly]Get out of here Ranma. Nobody wants you.

[Everybody starts arguing and says one or two things about 
Ranma. Ranma just recalls how he had left Nerima on bad 
terms with quite a few people. He just snaps.]

Ranma:[Menacingly snarls]You know what? SHUT THE FUCK UP.

[Everyone silences, in disbelief at what just came out of
his mouth]

Akane:[Doesn't believe what she just heard]What did you say 
you baka?

Ranma:[Shakes his head, then yells]I SAID SHUT THE FUCK UP!

Tofu:[Concerned and walks toward Ranma]Calm down Ranma.

Tatewaki: So, Saotome speaks with his vile tongue as well. 
How dishonorable. The Saotome name reeks of a dishonorable 
stench.

Ranma:[Furious]Shut your fucking mouth Kuno! I ain't the one
with a family of fucking nuts! You think you're so good with
a fucking bokken! Ha, YOU.. are the one who's a fuckin' 
joke![Narrows eyes]And as for my honor?! What the hell is 
it that I've done?! I know a lot of you have thought bad 
things of me when I ran away! None of you know what honor 
is! Do you think honor is just having great power to control 
others? To impress someone for your own sake? You fuckin' 
bastards... You know nothing!

Tofu: Calm down Ranma![Attempts to strike a pressure point 
on Ranma's neck but his hand is caught by a lightning fast
Ranma]

Ranma:[Unimpressed]Don't even try it doc.[Strikes a point 
on Tofu's neck that harmlessly renders him unconscious]

Ranma:[Drops Tofu's body]Next?

Kuno: Die fiend!

[Kuno thrusts as hard as he can toward Ranma's chest. Ranma
does nothing and just lets the bokken smash into little 
pieces against his hard chest.]

Kuno:[Disbelief]What sorcery is this?!

Ranma: Your own fucked up mind.[Strikes Kuno in the back of 
the head knocking him out]

[Ryoga pops up in front of Ranma]

Ryoga:[Sarcastic]I'll take you on Captain.

Ranma:[Glares]Outside you fucking pervert.

[They run outside on the street, Ranma leads Ryoga away from
his car though, to a safe distance.]

Ryoga:[Screams]Die Ranma!!

[Ryoga just gives Ranma a flurry of powerful attacks across
his face and torso. Ranma doesn't do anything and takes the
hits.]

Ranma:[Yawns]Are you done P-chan? This is really tedious.

Ryoga:[Shocked and mad]Why you...[Jumps back and screams]
Shi-shi-hokodan!!

[A huge ball of ki erupts out of Ryoga and floats in the air
above. It shoots down aimed at Ranma.]

Ranma:[Unnerved]Hmph. I didn't want to do this.[Cups his
hands and aims at Ryoga's attack and yells]Tuk-gong Mouko-
Takabisha!!

[A huge blue ball of ki shoots out of Ranma's hands and 
intercepts Ryoga's ki, sending them both flying away into 
the sky.]

Ryoga:[Tired and wheezing, in shock]How is that possible? 
How can you be that strong?

Ranma:[Doesn't show a hint of exhaustion, shakes head]Ryoga,
you idiot. Do you know how many people are around here?
[Walks toward him with a frown]Do you know how many people
could have been killed?

Ryoga:[Panicked]Die![Throws a punch with his right arm]

Ranma:[Casually grabs arm and put the elbow on his shoulder]
And to think I once called you a friend.[Snaps arm at the 
elbow leaving Ryoga screaming]

[Ryoga cries in pain while the others who have come out to 
watch only stare at Ranma in fear.]

Ranma: You need to be restrained Ryoga. You're little piss-
ant attitude is gonna get someone killed one day. 

Akane:[Runs up to their fight]What did you do?[Looks at 
Ryoga's snapped elbow]Oh my god! Ryo-chan! Ranma! How could
you!

Ranma:[Glares at Akane]You...you bitch, I risked my life for
you, gave my love, gave you everything! And you betray me 
and turn me into your enemy. Shame on you. 

Akane:[Looks at Ranma]What's wrong with you! You're not the 
Ranma I remember!

Ranma:[Looks at everyone]This is the reason why I didn't 
want to meet any of you. This is who I am. I am no longer 
Ranma the martial artist. I am Captain Saotome, defender of
the innocent, the seeker of justice. I became a cop so that
I can protect and serve, do something I could never do if 
I had stayed here. I may be violent, I may be ruthless to 
you, but everyday what I do makes a difference in all your
lives, so that you can live a better life.

Nabiki: Since when the hell did you start talking like a 
freakin' saint huh?

Ranma: When I got a clue that my fucking life wasn't worth
spending around here.

[Everyone is speechless, Akane starts crying.]

Cologne:[Glares]Then what did you come for son in law? Now 
that you're done with establishing a good job and future I 
believe it's time you marry Shampoo. I won't have you 
staining thousands of years of Amazon tradition.

Ranma: The only person I wanted to meet was Ucchan. But all 
of you had to ruin that occasion.[Glares at Cologne]And as 
for you, Cologne, you better give up on that fucking claim of
Shampoo being my fiancee.

Cologne:[Mad]How insolent. Do you think you'll get what you
want that way?

Ranma:[Losing patience]How about I just snap your fucking 
spine in front of Shampoo, would that be enough?

Cologne:[Shocked]......What did you just say to me muko-dono?
How dare you say that to an elder of the Amazons! You shall
be punished for that careless remark!

Ranma:[Looks down at the ground then looks up at Cologne]I
guess I didn't make myself clear.[A visible aura flares up
to a burning red around Ranma who is yelling]I said I'm 
gonna break your fucking spine and rip your fucking heart 
out if you don't fucking get out of my fucking face!![Pulls
out his pistol and sticks it to Cologne's forehead]I'll put 
a bullet in your fucking head before I marry Shampoo! No one
is gonna tell me what to do from now on![Cologne is frozen in
shock with the gun still at her head]

Shampoo:[Pleads to Ranma and starts crying]Please Air...Ranma!
Don't kill hibachan! Shampoo beg of you!

Ranma:[Surprised by Shampoo's bizarre show of emotion, 
holsters gun]Pathetic. All of you.[Looks at Ukyo]Ucchan, can
you afford to leave the restaurant for an hour or so? I 
wanna talk with you, just to chat on some things.

Ukyo:[Nervous]Uh..sure Ranchan.[Yells to the restaurant]
Konatsu, I'll be gone for a while! Take care of the 
restaurant!

Konatsu:[Head sticks out of the restaurant]Yes Ukyou-sama!

Ranma:[Points to Chevy]Lets go somewhere.

Ukyo:[Blank face, still uncomprehending what just happened]
Sure, right.[Climbs in the truck]

Nabiki:[Yells out in a fury]Where do you think you're going?!
Get back here Saotome! You got some explaining to do!

Ranma:[Looks back at Nabiki]Yeah, I got two words for you. 
FUCK and YOU.[Smiles evily]If I wanna hear from a bitch I'll
talk to my dog Nabiki.[Sticks his middle finger at her before
closing his door]
 
[Ranma starts the car and peels out of the street leaving 
everyone in the dust.]

Akane: I can't believe all this just happened.[Looks down 
street where Ranma disappeared]He's changed so much.

Nabiki:[Mad and frustrated]I'm gonna find out what happened
to him these past couple years. That guy can't possibly be
the Ranma we know.

Cologne:[Recovered from shock]I'll get you back for this 
son in law. Nobody escapes 3000 years of Amazon tradition.

[Doctor Tofu has recovered and goes over to help Ryoga as 
everyone just stands still trying to comprehend what 
happened.]


					*	*	*

[We see the camera focused in front of a fast food restaurant.
Ranma and Ukyo sit down in a table with trays of food.]

Ukyo:[Speaks]What was that back there Ranma?

Ranma:[Takes a bite out of a burger and answers]4 years of
pent up frustrations.

Ukyo:......

Ranma: I only went there to meet you Ucchan. Just wanted to
see how my friend was doing. 

Ukyo:[Looking at Ranma]You've changed so much. I don't 
recognize you anymore.

Ranma:[Expected this]I thought you might say that. A lot 
happened to me the past 4 years. I've experienced a lot of
things as a cop. You guys couldn't possible understand it all.
I've had friends die in my arms, kids getting killed over 
drugs, shit like that.

Ukyo:[Narrows eyes]Where did you learn to swear like that?
And hurt people? You broke Ryoga's arm and threatened to 
kill Cologne like it was nothing.

Ranma:[Thinks for a moment, then speaks]I guess you could
blame me for being the sadistic ruthless thug you see in 
front of you. I'm sorry I never wrote to you or talked with
you.

Ukyo:[Smiles sadly]That's all right Ranchan.

Ranma: I've done a lot of things that have gone against who 
I used to be. Swearing is something that just came along 
after years of busting thugs and handling crime. 

Ukyo:[Starts to understand]I see.

Ranma: Do you wanna know what I used to do?

Ukyo:[Curious]Yeah.

Ranma:[Breathes deep and exhales]Ucchan, in my first two 
months as a cop I got into my first shootout. It was nothing
like I expected. My partner was shot and died in my arms and
several other officers died as well. When I got the chance I
killed 5 armed men with one quick motion of my pistol. I was
traumatized pretty badly.[Chuckles at the thought, concerning
Ukyo badly]You probably think I'm nuts. Anyway, I was about
to quit on the spot, until I saw a class of school kids who
were caught in the gunfire. They were all alive because of 
me.

Ukyo:[Quiet]......

Ranma:[Continues]Anyway, I saw for a moment how many lives 
I saved at the consequence of killing 5 people. So I stayed
on the job. The next couple of years I spent hard at work,
making lots of busts and becoming a homicide detective. The
ironic thing is, I killed a lot of people when I had a job
meant to protect people.

Ukyo:[Shocked]I wouldn't expect hearing something like this
from you.

Ranma:[Smirks]I figured you'd say that.

[The two continue eating and there is uncomfortable silence.
Ukyo is thinking hard and staring at Ranma in wonder.]

Ukyo:[Thoughtful]You know Ranchan, you've never been this 
talkative and deep before. You never did talk about your 
feeling and stuff like this. Care to explain?

Ranma:[Eyeballs wander around while he thinks]You're right, 
I've changed a lot when it comes to expressing myself. I 
think it's because of my lifestyle and therapies. I had to 
go to a shrink a couple of times when I couldn't contemplate
some of the things I did. Also my job requires a lot of 
talking in different situations.[Smiles]I bet I'm a good 
enough liar now to fool Nabiki even.

Ukyo: That's quite a handful there.

Ranma:[Playfully]Whatever.[Changes subject]By the way Ucchan,
how have you been doin' while I was gone? Have any boyfriends?

Ukyo:[Smiles sadly]I've tried to see if I could go around 
with a couple of guys after the shock of not being able to 
have you, but I haven't found anyone yet. I guess nobody 
around is anything like you.

Ranma:[Smiles sadly]I'm sorry Ucchan, I never meant to hurt
you, I didn't want to, but I just didn't see you as a lover 
or a wife. I always and still see you as a best friend or 
even a sister.[Smirks]Or a brother.

Ukyo:[Chuckles]Shut up you baka. You know, at least my 
business got better, I got a small chain goin up now, I have
two restaurants open and another one being set up in Okayama.
While you were gone I went to night school and got a business
degree.[Laughs]I never would've guessed that school could 
help so much in the food business!

Ranma:[Smiles]That's great Ucchan! I'm happy for you! I 
guess you become very successful. Now that you mention 
Okonomiyaki...[Pulls out envelope and gives it to Ucchan]I
want to give you something for all the free food you gave 
me from before.   

Ukyo:[Sees what it is]Wha...[Eyes Widen]Jeez, there must be
over 500,000 yen in here!

Ranma: It was a lot of food I ate there... I probably ate 
more than anyone else who went there, and for free too.

Ukyo:[Frowns]Ranchan... I can't take this, you're like family
to me. And I don't charge my family.[Tries to hand back 
envelope] Don't you need the money?

Ranma:[Smiles]Fine. If you see it that way than it's a 
present for all the birthdays, Christmas', and whatever 
days that I missed for you. Besides Ucchan, I don't need 
any of that money. I'm not the poor martial artist like I 
used to be. I get paid a LOT for what I do. And if you still
refuse it, I'm gonna force it into your bank accounts and 
scatter it so you can't trace it. It'll just be there, for 
you to use.

Ukyo:[Laughs]Ok,ok, you win. Thank you Ranchan.

Ranma: Don't mention it.[Changes subject again]You know, I
have a week to choose a place to live. The NSA says I can 
live anywhere I want and they'll pay for everything. I still
haven't chosen where.

Ukyo:[Playful look on her face]How about settling down with
me? Have a lil' fun with your best buddy?

Ranma:[Laughs]That would be fun Ucchan. It would've been great
to go to college with you.[Somber]But I can't do that. You 
know what I mean.

Ukyo:[Sad but pained smile on her face]I know. But we'll be
friends forever right?

Ranma:[Looks at her, and leans over to her]Friends forever.
[Gives Ukyo a deep but friendly kiss]I may not love you as a 
wife, but I love you with all my heart as a friend.

Ukyo:[Frozen still and blushing red]I...I...

Ranma: You've been my only real friend around here Ucchan.
The reason I love you so much is because you were selfless 
enough to give me up.[Saddens]You don't deserve me Ucchan.
Look at me. I've turned into a killer. I believe I help out
many people in turn for the criminals I kill, but...I've just
changed into a completely different person from who you know.

Ukyo:[Still surprised]Jeez Ranchan, you turned into a darn 
chatter bug! Who could've guessed you would talk so much 
about your feelings like that![Turns compassionate]And don't
think of yourself as a killer or a bad person. I can still
see a lot of the old Ranma in you.[Looks him over]I guess 
you just changed more into a matured version of yourself. 
Sorta like a soldier who just came back from war. 

Ranma: I'm sorry, I didn't know that I used to talk so 
little.

Ukyo:[Huffs]Gosh, I'm only kidding. I like how you can speak 
with your feelings now.

Ranma:[Chuckles]Whatever.[Pulls out a map of Japan]Well. 
Would you like to help pick out a place for me to stay?

Ukyo:[Scans map]Where do you wanna stay?

Ranma:[Thinks and speaks]I wanna be stationed close to you
and my parents, but away from Nerima.

Ukyo:[Fingers envelope of money from Ranma]You know, now 
that I've thought about it I've been saving a little cash 
to buy a car for myself. The money you gave me gives me more
than enough now. I could probably visit you easily if you 
lived away from Nerima.

Ranma:[Thinks of an idea]Hey, I know! You said you have a 
restaurant in Okayama right?

Ukyo: Yeah. It's almost done being made. I open it in a few
days.

Ranma: Do you have living quarters there? 

Ukyo: Of course. All of my restaurants are designed so that 
me and Konatsu can stay for an indefinite amount of time.

Ranma: How about this. You can move to Okayama and I'll
station there! It's pretty close to Nerima but far enough,
and I'll be able to see you everyday.

Ukyo: Oh. That's not a bad idea.

Ranma: Not fuckin' bad at all.[Notices what he just said and 
sees that Ukyo's eyes had widened]Sorry. It's a bad habit.

Ukyo:[Raises eyebrow]It'll take some time to get used to.

[Both chuckle and smile at each other's presence. Ranma's 
cell phone rings and he answers it.]

Ranma: Moshi-moshi?

Nodoka: Hello Ranma.

Ranma: Hey mom! What did you call me for?

Nodoka: I just wanted to thank my son for the wonderful 
gift you gave me. Your father is quite happy about.[Genma 
can be heard in the background cheering about money]

Ranma: I hope you get something that you like with it.

Nodoka: We've talked and I've decided that we should buy a 
car. It would save us a lot of work instead of walking all 
the time. Plus we can visit you easier when you move away 
from us.

Ranma:[Surprised]Oh. What a coincidence, Ucchan is buying a 
car too.[Ukyo shrugs]

Nodoka: That's nice. There is this other matter we have to 
talk about Ranma. Tendo-san called me just now and told me 
what happened at the Ucchan. [Voice turns cold]You better 
have a good explanation for this son, because Tendo's words
were not very pleasant.

Ranma:[Grits teeth]I didn't want it to happen. They provoked
me.

Nodoka:[Tension]What I heard was that you made a loud 
outburst of language at everyone.

Ranma: So I did. They kept bickering to me about why I was
there and that I was ruining their fun. Ryoga and Akane 
paired against me to make me look like a thug.

Nodoka:[Sounds mad]It seems like this conversation won't go 
anywhere. Ranma, you better control yourself in the future. 
You're off the hook for now because our family's honor has 
not been sullied. Next time try not be so bitter about you 
and Akane. She chose her own decision and desecrated her own
family's honor. It has nothing to do with you now.

Ranma:[Slumps voice]Yes, okaasan.

Nodoka:[Brightens up immediately]Well then son, I'll see you
home later.

Ranma:[Caught off guard]Uh, sure, bye.[Hangs up phone]

Ukyo:[Head on top of her arms leaning on the table, looking 
at Ranma's eyes]I'm guessing your mom heard what happened?

Ranma: Yeah.

Ukyo: You know what,[Gets up]lets just forget about it. We
better prepare for Okayama.

Ranma:[Brightens, gets up as well]Right.

[The two walk out of the restaurant and the scene fades 
while focusing on the two getting in the Chevy and driving
off.]

Author's Notes: (It's quite a bit, but you better read it 
all if you can't understand a couple of things. Next time 
this section won't be this long. It's only because this is
the first chapter)

This is my first fanfic, so don't judge me too harshly. I 
came up with the idea for this fic while I was reading "In 
the Line of Fire". I thought that the idea of Ranma becoming
a great police officer would be great and be interesting to 
write. There were many things in this story that has to be 
explained for a reader to understand the story better.

I know that Ranma seems way too out of character to be 
acting as violent and bizarre as he is. But you have to 
think of this carefully, what would you do if the same 
things happened to you? Don't you think that after Ranma 
saved Akane from Jusendo he would love her enough to start
studying hard in school for her sake? Love can do many 
things to guys who get caught by it. Also, you have to take
in account that Ranma is very bitter against everyone in
Nerima (except Ukyo and his parents)for the years of 
heartbreak and humiliation he had to go through when Akane
left him for Ryoga. Another issue in Ranma's behavior is 
his horrifying tolerance of killing people. When you become
a police officer in LA for a couple years, and get to work 
in the SIS, killing people becomes a regular routine as long
as it can be justified by saving the innocent. And as for 
Ranma's bad language, can you think of any real big city cop
who never swears? Or even a high school student? I think it
makes him seem more mature(in a way)and a lot tougher.

Many of you will think that the police aspect of this story
is all a bunch of crap and is made up. Well, it's not. I 
have many cops in the family who are in the LAPD who have 
told me many stories about what happened to them in their 
past years. Police officers kill criminals all the time, and
it happens very often. I myself want to be a cop, and I am 
also a gun freak and car freak as well. I just had to put in
that scene where Ranma gets a bunch of military surplus 
weapons and gets a kick ass Chevy Tahoe. If you wish to see
the weapons Ranma picked out, go to www.beretta.com for the
Beretta 92FS, www.sigarms.com for the Sig Sauer P226, and 
www.hkpro.com for the two Heckler and Koch rifles he gets.

The Special Investigate Squad [SIS] is a real bureau in the 
LAPD's Metropolitan Division. It is the only permanent force 
of police officers in the US that was purposefully made to 
kill hardcore criminals on the streets of LA. Their method 
of operation is to stake out a specific criminal and waiting
for them to commit a crime. The purpose is to provoke a 
shootout between the SIS detectives and the suspect so that
the detectives can legally execute a criminal on the spot. 
They are very well armed and are the only police team allowed
to use any type of firearm in the US. They are basically a 
legalized death squad.

The JNSA is something that I made up, I have no idea what 
kind of methods the Japanese government uses, let alone 
which units get to carry concealed handguns. I tried to base
it on the KNSA, the Korean National Security Agency, formerly
known as KCIA, the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Yes,
I know. Us damn Koreans like to copy off of the US government.
The KNSA is the equivalent of the American FBI and CIA 
combined, making them very powerful with authority.

Also introduced in the story is the art of Tuk-gong Moosul.
This is a real Korean martial art practiced only by 3 
divisions of the South Korean government. The 686 National
Police Unit(The Korean version of a SWAT team, except they 
are WAY better), the Army's Special Warfare Combat Battalion
(The Korean version of the Navy SEALs, they are about the 
same, maybe the SEALs are a little better), and the Korean 
Army's 707th Counter-terrorism battalion(The Korean version
of the US Delta Force, and they are totally better than those
failures.). These guys practice the most powerful and 
effective style of fighting in the world, hands down. It is
ot publicized much because it is actually illegal to teach 
it to anyone not in those three special forces.  Most of the 
moves are kept secret. The style is not a martial art at all
because it is designed purely to kill the opponent, and 
defend while killing. It is a mix of Tae-kwon do, Hapkido,
various styles of Kung-fu, maybe some Ninjitsu(they are 
extraordinarily silent when they move around for covert
missions and are sometimes seen as ghosts), and advanced 
acupuncture(for lethal pressure points and effective "man 
stopping" power).

I would bet my life that these guys can take on anyone in the 
world in 1 on 1 hand to hand combat.  All of this was revealed
to the public only a few years ago because the Korean gov't
hides many secrets from the public.  The 686 is a famous group
of "SWAT" officers who take on all sorts of hostage and 
terrorist acts in Korea.  The 707th, as mentioned by Ranma 
in this fic, is a very elite group of soldiers who are hand
picked by the Army to be in the group.  They are easily on 
par with the best counter-terrorist groups in the world, like
the British 22nd Special Air Services Regiment or the German
GrenSchutzGruppe-9. American anti-terrorists don't even come
close, for people who know, Delta Force has failed many times
in big hostage operations, resulting in the deaths of many.
They're brave, and they are good, but they're not great. 707,
SAS, and GSG-9 have never failed a big operation in the 
history of their existence(Except for the GSG-9, they 
recently fucked up a huge mission somewhere in Europe and 
let some big drug lord get away from apprehension).

For you people who would like to argue with me about the 
facts above, you better come up with some good evidence to
prove that I'm wrong otherwise.

Anyways, for the next chapter I plan to introduce some of the
Tenchi characters immediately(finally), and Ranma's life is
about to change some more in his new home.

By the way, the intro was my recreation of a scene from the
movie Die Hard with a Vengeance. The cars are the same, and
the way Ranma gets the guy is the same too, shooting the bad 
guy by swerving his Benz wildly in a circle. In case you're 
wondering, John McClane is in fact the same character from
Die Hard. 

Please tell me how I'm doing.
