  No Need For Interstellar War ! Part 2 :The Zerg


Sasami: Someone help !

    The young girl began to run from the creature that was chasing her . But she 
suddenly heard a new noise it was slithering noise that was in front of her. She 
suddenly stopped in her tracks as she saw a 
creature similar to the one that was chasing after her ! Except this one had a 
snake-like end and no legs.

Sasami: Tenchi !!!!! Help !!!!

	There was no answer . She began to back into a tree as the two creatures 
advanced on her.
She closed her eyes and prpard for the end but, it never came. She heard a roar 
but kept her eyes
shut.

Fenix: Are you all right young one ?

    Her eyes snapped open to reveal a one of the Protoss warriors in front of her. 
Beside him was Tenchi.

Sasami: Fenix you saved me !

	She rushed up to hug her savior and suprisingly his armor was warm and 
not cold like others.

Tenchi: What happened ?

Sasmi: Tenchi , A thing attacked me ! Fenix saved me !

Tenchi: Fenix do  you know whats going on ?

Fenix: Yes it was a Zerg ...A race that assimilates all types of creatures to serve 
them.

Tenchi: Oh man what are those ?!!

  The three looked behind them to see several Hydralisks(the snake aliens ) 
standing there ready to fight .

Fenix: Tenchi get Sasami out of here I'll take care of this !

	Tenchi stood for a moment as Fenix slashed on of the Zerg open with his 
blades. Fenix rushed the second one with great speed and jammed the blade up 
its chin to reveal a large amount of blood.

Fenix: Go Tenchi !

	Tenchi scooped Sasami in his arms and ran towards the house.Then he 
felt a spike of pain a large object went through his shoulder but, he kept on 
running.

Sasami: Tenchi your hurt !

Tenchi: I won't stop until your safe !

	He managed to make it the house where Misaski was waiting.He rushed in 
and put Sasami on the
couch.

Misaki: Oh Sasami are you all right ? Oh my poor baby !

     She rushed to Sasami and bear hugged her .Sasami could do nothing but try 
to smile and say she was
all right.

*******************************************************************************

In the wreckage of the carrier known as the Gantrithor a number of insectiod 
creatures roamed inside its
halls.In the center a being which had manifested itself could only be described as 
an eye with many stems.
It was known as the overmind.

Overmind: That human has incredible energy. His aura is unlike anything I have 
ever felt. I must have his energy ! Hunter Hydralisks come forth ! Queen come 
forth !Get the boy known as Tenchi ! Bring him to me alive whilst I prepare a 
chrysalis !

*******************************************************************************

Washu: thats the last one !

	To protect them from the aliens known as the Zerg Washu set up steel 
barricade walls.

Washu: That should protect us until we know what we are dealing with. Ryoko !

Ryoko: Yes ?

Washu: Go to Tenchi's room and guard him in case something happens .

Ryoko: All right !

	Ryoko walked to Tenchi's room to find him resting from his injury.

Ryoko: Oh Tenchi why didn't you call me for help ? I could have protected you !

	Tenchi was already fast alseep and snoring. Ryoko went to his window 
and sat thinking about how this predicament could enhance her relationship with 
Tenchi. Her dreams soon turned to indecent 
thoughts as she fell asleep next to her secret love.

CRASH !!!!!!!!!!!!

	Ryoko snapped her eyes open. In front of her was a spider-like creature. It 
looked at her and then 
Tenchi.

Ryoko: Oh, no you don't !

She fired three of her bolts. All hit the creature but did little damage. Tenchi was 
awake but still trying to get his bearings. The creature took this advantage and 
launched a goo which hardened on impact. Tenchi
struggled but was caught. Ryoko egnited her blade and slashed the monster 
again doing little damage.

Ryoko: What the hell is this thing ? **gasp** Tenchi NO!!

The creature was carrying Tenchi away she began to fly but was caught by 
several spikes from new aliens
bellow. Ryoko slammed to the ground and shot bolts on all five of the aliens 
blowing them away.

Ryoko: **crying**  Tenchi ......Tenchi !!!!!!!!!

**********************************************************************************

Tenchi awoke in a chamber inside a place with alien walls.

Tenchi: Where am I ?

Overmind: You are in my colony. You are now mine !

Tenchi: What the hell are you ?

Overmind: I am the Overmind ! A mind of millions of creatures.

Tenchi: What do you want with me ?

Overmind: I wan't your power ! and your mind. Put him into the chrysalis!

	A creature similar to the one that captured him dropped him into an egg of 
some kind.

Tenchi: LET ME OUT !! I CAN'T BREATHE !!!!

Ovrmind:when you are ready my child. When you are ready !
