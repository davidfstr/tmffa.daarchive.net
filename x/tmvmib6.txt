Part 1:  Tenchi Muyo! versus Men in Black
By William Benjamin Grilliette  (evilpii@juno.com)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 6

Scene 1

{The main door to MiB HQ opens as Tenchi, Ryoko, Kiyone, J, and Mitsuki enter and walk to the
elevator.  Ryoko's arm is draped across Tenchi's shoulder as he supports her weight and eases her
forward.  Mitsuki cradles her cut hand while she walks between Kiyone and J.  The elevator starts
descending as Ryoko's eyes open slowly.  Tenchi looks over to Ryoko's quiet face.}

Tenchi:  Hey, Ryoko.  {Smiles.}

Ryoko:  {Smiles a little.}  Tenchi...  We get him...?

Tenchi:  We will.  You rest now.

Ryoko:  {Shakes her head.}  No, I'll be fine.

J:  Hey!

{Tenchi and Ryoko look at J.}

J:  You two lovebirds can flirt later!  We got a bug to squash!

{Tenchi and Ryoko both teardrop with wry smiles.  Kiyone and Mitsuki both snicker at this sight.
The elevator reaches the empty INS floor when the PA system clearly speaks out.}

PA:  Code blue!  Agent L, agent Q, and agent S!  Report to medlab immediately!  Repeat.  Code
	blue!  Agent...

{The announcement continues to repeat.  The color drains from Tenchi's face as he realizes.}

Tenchi:  Ayeka...!!

{Cut to the medlab.  Alarms blare.  L along with two male MiB agents (Q and S) scurry about the
room trying to take all the data and come to some consensus on the problem.}

L:  {Turns from a vitals monitor.}  BP rising rapidly!

S:  Her heartbeat's erratic!  {Points to the heart monitor.}  It can't take much more of this!

{Q is drawing a clear fluid from a bottle into a syringe carefully.}

Q:  I'll give her 20 CCs of cardiac stabilizer!

{S slams Q's arm down against the counter causing him to drop the syringe.  Q glares into S's
eyes as S does the same.}

S:  She's Juraian!  That'd kill her!!

Q:  What should we do then?!  Let her die on the table?!

L:  What about her neural patterns?  Is her nervous system shutting down?

Q:  {Glances to the brain activity monitor.}  No, her brain's still operating, but without a
	heart, she's dead anyway!!

{The door slides open to find Tenchi looking in aghast at the doctors arguing.}

Tenchi:  What's going on?!

L:  {Hurried.}  Please wait outside, Tenchi.

Tenchi:  {Determined.}  Tell me the situation, L!

{L looks slightly away from Tenchi to see Sasami a distance behind him.  Sasami's face is full of
fear looking at everything.  L looks back into Tenchi's eyes with solemnity.}

L:  Turn around and do what you have to.  I'm going to turn around and do what I have to,
	alright?

{Tenchi looks behind him and sees Sasami.  He is speechless as L closes and seals the door.  The
heart monitor suddenly shoots to zero with an ominously high tone.}

S:  Her heart's stopped beating!!

L:  {Spins around to Ayeka.}  Oh God!!

{L grabs the paddles from a nearby crash cart and places them against Ayeka's chest.}

L:  {To S.}  Give me enough for a Juraian!

{S sets the energy level, and the device charges.  Almost immediately, it finishes charging, and
L shocks Ayeka.  The heart monitor blips for a moment and then is flat again.}

L:  Raise it!

S:  {Changes the setting.}  Done!

{L repeats the shock with the same result.  Zoom in on Ayeka's face.}

L:  Dammit, Princess!!  Don't do this!!  Not two in a row!  {To S.}  Higher!!

{Fade away to black.  A pink light enters the darkness.  At the center of this pink light is
Ayeka floating unconscious in the space.  Her eyes open slightly and weakly.}

Ayeka:  It is so dark...

{She looks around as her surrounding light slowly contracts to a dim sphere around her.  She
wraps her arms around herself as if she is cold.}

Ayeka:  It is... cold...  {Calls out.}  Tenchi...!  Tenchi, are you there...?

{To Ayeka's eyes, Tenchi's face appears before her and vanishes.  Ayeka closes her eyes tightly.}

Ayeka:  It is lonely here...  All this blackness is trying to envelop me...

{Ayeka looks into the black ocean loningly.}

Ayeka:  Tenchi...  please...  find me...

{Another voice rings out in the blackness.  Strangely, the voice is the same as Ayeka's, but in a
mocking tone.}

Mock Ayeka:  Ha!  You think Tenchi is coming to save you?  You are such a pathetic woman,
	Princess Ayeka of Jurai!  While you are here in the black, he and Ryoko are probably off
	together doing unspeakable things.  {Laughs.}

{Ayeka's face turns to one of shock at these words.}

Ayeka:  Who are you?!  Why are you lying like this?!

Mock Ayeka:  Am I lying?  Have you not seen them when they are together?  They genuinely care for
	each other.  There is no use in denying it any longer.

Ayeka:  Tenchi cares for me deeply!  He risked his life to save me from Kagato!

Mock Ayeka:  Did he?  He might have done that only to save Jurai itself, not you.  Look at
	yourself!

{A figure of Ayeka in her TM!iL battlesuit appears in the blackness hanging as though crucified.
Ayeka blinks in disbelief.}

Mock Ayeka:  Even in this form, you are the pitiful Princess Ayeka of Jurai who can do nothing
	but worry and fret instead of act.  That is why Tenchi wants Ryoko.  She actually lives!

{Ayeka allows her arms to fall to her side as she yells into the blackness.}

Ayeka:  I am not Ryoko!!  I cannot live like Ryoko!!

{The pink aura around her body breaks allowing the blackness to touch her chest.  Ayeka grabs her
chest and gasps.  Her eyes go wide in sudden, sharp pain.  She clinches her eyes tightly as the
pink aura starts to grow out again.}

Ayeka:  {Commanding.}  I am Princess Ayeka of Jurai!!  I live as myself, no one else!!

{Her eyes open with a glare.}

Ayeka:  {Screams.}  I will LIVE!!

{Ayeka's aura explodes into the blackness, destroying the TM!iL illusion and the darkness.
However zooming in on her chest under her hands, a small piece of the black ocean survives and
adheres to Ayeka.  Cut back to MiB medlab where a heart monitor starts beeping regularly and
with Ayeka's strong heartbeat.  L wipes the sweat from her forehead and slumps on the floor
next to Ayeka's bed.  Q and S both sit on the counter exhausted.}

Q:  I need a cigarette...

{S looks over to Q with a cold glare as the door opens.  Tenchi walks in slowly with Sasami in
his arms.  He looks over to L on the floor with concern written on his face and fear on
Sasami's.  L looks back to them and sighs with a small smile on her face.}

L:  She's a strong woman.  I think she's past this.

Tenchi:  Somehow, I knew that.

Sasami:  Is... is she okay?

L:  {Nods.}  Yeah, Sasami.  Your sister's going to be just fine.

{Tenchi and Sasami both go to Ayeka's side and look at her motionless before them save her
gentle breath moving her hair.  Then, Ayeka's eyes slightly open and look at Tenchi's face.
Tenchi and Sasami both blink in disbelief.}

Ayeka:  {Weakly.}  Ten... chi...

{Tenchi takes her hand and kneels to her.  Sasami starts to leak tears of joy as she too holds
Ayeka's hand.}

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Yeah, I'm here, Ayeka...

Ayeka:  Where am I...?

Tenchi:  {Caringly.}  Sh...  Don't worry about it right now.  You need to rest.

Ayeka:  {Worried.}  What about the creature...?

Tenchi:  Ayeka, there'll be time for that later.  You just rest and get better.  {Smiles.}

{Ayeka closes her eyes and nods back to Tenchi.  As Ayeka drifts off to sleep surrounded by the
two other Jurai, pan to the doorway to see Ryoko standing there with a small smile and yet
mixed emotions in her eyes.  However, her eyes only show love for Tenchi and concern for Ayeka
and Sasami.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{Ayeka opens her eyes and finds Tenchi sitting at her bedside.  He looks over to her and smiles
a little.}

Tenchi:  Looks like she's decided to wake up.

Ayeka:  Tenchi?  {Sits up in bed.}  Wh... where am I?  Where is this?  {Looks about the room.}

{Tenchi turns to Ayeka.  Next to Tenchi, Sasami turns to Ayeka also with a cute smile across
her face.}

Sasami:  We're in the US, Ayeka!  Isn't it great?  {Giggles.}

Ayeka:  {Rubs her eyes.}  The United States...?  {Thinks.}  Oh, I remember now... the
	battlecruiser and then...

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Yes.  You've been asleep for about a day.

Ayeka:  {Surprised.}  I have?

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Yes, L even says your heart stopped for about two minutes.

{Ayeka is speechless and a little pale as Tenchi continues.}

Tenchi:  {Worried.}  You alright, Ayeka?

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  Yes, I am a bit... weary and somewhat cold, but nothing more unusual than
	that.

Tenchi:  That's good.  We were all worried about you.

Ayeka:  {A little surprised.}  You were...?

Tenchi:  Of course we were!  Ayeka, none of us wants to lose you.  {Smiles.}  Even Ryoko was
	concerned about you.

Ayeka:  {Shocked.}  Ryoko was...?!

Tenchi:  Yeah, Ryoko doesn't show it much, but she cares about you, Ayeka.

{Ayeka is quiet when Sasami speaks up.}

Sasami:  We all were praying for you, Ayeka.  We're so happy you're better.

{Sasami reaches up and hugs Ayeka tightly.  Ayeka hugs back what she can.}

Sasami:  {Whispers.}  Oh, I love you, Ayeka...!!  I don't want to lose you...!!

{Some tears escape Sasami's young eyes as she shuts them in the hug.  Ayeka smiles a little and
whispers back.}

Ayeka:  I will not leave you, Sasami.  I promise.

{Tenchi smiles at the sisters in their embrace when the door slides open with L on the other
side.}

L:  Looks like you're doing better, Princess.

{Ayeka and Sasami break the hug but still hold each other and remain close.}

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  Yes, L.  I would like to offer you my thanks for saving my life.  If there is
	a way I can repay you...

L:  {Shakes her head.}  Forget it.  I just did my job.  You should thank him.  {Indicates
	Tenchi.}  He remained at your side just about the whole time.  He only left to save
	Ryoko, Kiyone, and J's lives.

{Tenchi blushes some.  Ayeka looks over to Tenchi as the Mock Ayeka voice echoes in her mind.}

Mock Ayeka:  While you are here in the black, he and Ryoko are probably off together doing
	unspeakable things.

{Ayeka shakes these thoughts from her mind.}

Ayeka:  {In her mind.}  No, no...  that's not Tenchi...  You know him better than that...

{Sasami looks at Ayeka's disturbed eyes.}

Sasami:  You okay, Ayeka?

{Ayeka looks down to Sasami and replies with a kind and yet reserved smile.}

Ayeka:  I am alright, Sasami.  I was just thinking.  That was all.

L:  {To Tenchi.}  I'm actually here for you, Tenchi.  Zed's having a briefing on the coming
	attack.  He wants you to be there.

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Right.

{Tenchi stands and looks back to Ayeka and Sasami.  Ayeka looks up at Tenchi with a concerned
expression.  Tenchi smiles a little.}

Tenchi:  It'll be alright, Ayeka.  Washu's got a plan.

{Ayeka starts to get out of bed.  Once her feet touch the floor she stumbles a bit and catches
herself on the bed's railing.  Tenchi jumps to her side and helps her as does Sasami.}

Tenchi:  {Shocked.}  Ayeka!  What're you doing?!

Ayeka:  {Glances into Tenchi's eyes.}  I am going with you.

Sasami:  Don't, Ayeka!  I don't want you hurt again!!

{Sasami starts to cry making Ayeka turn to her little sister.  Ayeka slowly brings herself to a
full standing position and turns to Sasami.  Tenchi looks at Ayeka and Sasami surprised.  Ayeka
sets her hands on Sasami's shoulders causing Sasami to look up to Ayeka still dripping tears.}

Ayeka:  Do not cry, Sasami.  I will be alright.  I promise.  Okay?  {Smiles some.}  Please do
	not worry.

{Ayeka gently wipes Sasami's eyes while Sasami sniffles.}

Ayeka:  {Seriously.}  Sasami, this is something I must do.  Alright?  {Smiles a little.}  How
	can I be hurt with Tenchi going too?

{Tenchi blushes a little as Sasami nods in response to Ayeka.  Ayeka smiles and removes her
hands from Sasami's shoulders.}

Ayeka:  Now, I want you to be good while Mihoshi looks after you, okay?

Sasami:  {Nods.}  Yes, Ayeka...

{L taps her watch.  Ayeka nods.}

Ayeka:  I have to go, Sasami.  I will be back soon.  I promise.

Sasami:  {Worried.}  Be careful, Ayeka...

Ayeka:  I will.  {Turns to Tenchi and nods.}

{Ayeka walks to Tenchi, and the two follow L from the room.  Ayeka stops in the corridor and
looks back to Sasami in the doorway of the medlab somewhat sad.  Tenchi's hand is placed on
Ayeka's shoulder causing her to look over to Tenchi's face.}

Tenchi:  She'll be alright, Ayeka.  She's a strong little girl, like her big sister.

{Ayeka smiles and blushes as she closes her eyes.}

Ayeka:  You are right, Tenchi...

{Ayeka opens her eyes to Sasami who is now smiling with pride back at Ayeka.  Ayeka smiles
relieved back to Sasami as Tenchi turns her back around, and they continue through the
corridor.  Fade to Tenchi, Ayeka, and L walking into Zed's office.  Washu spins her chair
around to face them while Zed sits broodingly behind his desk.  Kiyone, Mitsuki, J, and R stand
to the side.  Ryoko stands in a corner with Ryo-Ohki on her shoulder and her arms folded.  L
joins the GP and MiB while Tenchi and Ayeka stand in the doorway.  Tenchi looks over and sees
Ryoko in the corner and goes over to her.  Ryoko looks up to Tenchi quietly as he offers her
his hand with a tender smile.  Ryoko blinks in thought for a moment before she extends her hand
to Tenchi.  Tenchi directs Ryoko over with him to Ayeka's side.  Ayeka glances to Ryoko and
Tenchi holding hands coming towards her with a little surprise.  She quickly disguises her
surprise and faces Zed.  Tenchi and Ryoko release their hands and look forward also.  Zed looks
back to Ayeka.}

Zed:  Glad to see you're still with us, Princess Jurai.

Ayeka:  You all have a plan to destroy Illirg.  I want to be a part of that plan.

Kiyone:  {Concerned.}  Ayeka, are you...?

Ayeka:  {Raises her hand by her side.}  I am alright, Kiyone.  Do not worry.

L:  {Nods.}  Yeah, I checked her out.  She amazingly doesn't have any complications from the
	incident.  It's weird...

Zed:  Well, we can study the Princess's health after the immediate threat is dealt with.  First
	and foremost, we have to capture and destroy the biological weapon called Illirg.  For
	that, Dr. Hakubi has developed a device to destroy its shield defense.

Washu:  {Smiles.}  Quite.

{Washu creates her shadow laptop and types a few keys.  Zed's monitors come online with a
schematic drawing and a picture of the actual device.  The device is similar to a telescope.
Essentially, it is a pipe with one forked end with all its ports covered by a lens.  The two
branches of the fork each has a symbol over it:  the Ohki for Ryoan and the Light Hawk for the
Juraian.  Where the pipe forks, a Washu triangle is marked.  Zed glares over at Washu who is
smiling back at him widely.}

Zed:  Well, go ahead and explain the plan, Washu.

Washu:  {Scoffs.}  Alright.  The two lenses with Ohki and Light Hawk drawn over them are the
	inputs.  Ryoko and Tenchi are to emit Ryoan and Jurai power through these, allowing my
	invention to combine the two and amplify it into a spread that will cause all of Illirg's
	defensive screens to crumble away.

Ayeka:  {Speaks up.}  Tenchi's swordsmanship will be needed against Illirg himself.  I will
	take his place at this amplifier.

Tenchi:  {Looks to Ayeka.}  You sure you're ready for this?

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  I will live, Tenchi.  Do not worry yourself.

{Tenchi is voiceless as Washu interrupts and continues.  Ryoko sees Tenchi and Ayeka looking at
each other and closes her eyes quietly.}

Washu:  Okay, so Ayeka takes Tenchi's place.  That leaves him free to combat Illirg again, but
	this time he's not going to be alone.

{Washu types on her keyboard again and changes the image of the amplifier to that of a mobile
suit mech.  The head has two seats.  On the back is a red energy crystal as a power cell.  The
right arm has a magnetic end and an accelerator cannon.  The left arm has a gripping pincher
along with a machine gun pod on either side.  Each foot and leg structure has flight engines
equipped for aerial combat.}

Washu:  This suit here called the Lyex will be Tenchi's support.  Kiyone and J will pilot it,
	Kiyone movement and J weapons.  Kiyone's had GP training on mobile suit combat  though
	she might have to get used to the size.  J has had Terran police training and should be
	able to line up the targets.

J:  {Confident.}  Don't have a doubt about it, Washu!

Zed:  The goal here is to either destroy Illirg by shear firepower or enrage him enough to
	force the use of Jurai and NVO energy together.  I think the five of you can handle that.

Mitsuki:  What about L and myself?

Zed:  The two of you stay behind.

Mitsuki:  {Shocked.}  What?!  Zed, you know Galaxy Police protocol!  There must be at least two
	GP officers on site when the criminal is apprehended!

Zed:  {Seriously.}  I know the protocol, but I also know that you're a loose cannon, and I have
	assigned L to monitor you until this situation is resolved.  Is that clear?

{Mitsuki scowls and clinches her metal fist.  Kiyone looks over to Mitsuki's angry face with
some concern.}

Zed:  Also, this is not a GP arrest.  This is an MiB arrest.  You seem to forget that we are
	still the law enforcement body on this world, not you.

{Ryoko suddenly speaks up getting the room's attention.}

Ryoko:  So, why didn't you come to Japan when I crashed there or when Ayeka did?

Zed:  {Turns to Ryoko.}  Because Japan is a protected area by the GP and the Jurai Empire.

{The room blinks in confusion save Washu and Zed.}

Zed:  {Nods.}  I believe you all know the name Yosho.

Tenchi:  Yes, that's my grandfather's real name.

Zed:  Well, Prince Yosho of Jurai essentially annexed Japan into the Jurai Empire.  When the
	MiB was formed, Yosho sent a decree stating that Japan was to be left alone by the MiB
	and any alien presence.  We have saw to that.

Kiyone:  {Thinking.}  So, Tenchi's grandfather... arranged this?

Washu:  {Nods.}  Yeah, he did.  I checked Zed's records.  Lord Katsuhito issued an order
	declaring Japan off limits to the MiB's jurisdiction because he knew all of us would
	arrive there eventually.

Ayeka:  But, how could he know that so far ahead of time?

Washu:  His memory wasn't erased in 1970, remember?  Tenchi, you know your grandfather's
	preception.  He knew we were there and who you were.  Some of the coincidences
	surrounding our situations were orchestrated by your grandfather.  After all, he knew I
	was trapped in that crystal in the Masaki Shrine.  {Smiles.}  Besides, it keeps him from
	getting picked up by the MiB too.

{The room teardrops at Washu's comment, save Zed who is trying to control his irateness at
Washu's arrogance.  Mitsuki folds her arms.}

Mitsuki:  {Irate.}  Fine, I'll stay here, Zed.  Your doctors can examine me all they want.
	Just don't expect me to lie down and play dead for you.

{Mitsuki storms out of Zed's office.  Kiyone glances after her and then to Zed.}

Kiyone:  I'll talk to her.

J:  Hey, what about preparing for the fight?!

Kiyone:  {Glances back to J.}  I can handle that.  Just let me handle my old friend.

{Kiyone hastily walks out of Zed's office in pursuit of Mitsuki.  Kiyone finds Mitsuki sitting
on a bench.  Kiyone sits down beside Mitsuki and looks at her slumped form.}

Kiyone:  Mitsuki...

Mitsuki:  {Quietly.}  What do you want, Kiyone?

Kiyone:  I just wanted to see if you're alright.

Mitsuki:  Why should you be concerned about me?  I tried to arrest you back during the Kagato
	coup.  I pulled a gun on your friends for revenge of A's death.  I don't deserve your
	friendship anymore, Kiyone.

Kiyone:  {Sighs.}  Mitsuki, I'm sorry about A, and I know you didn't know anything about the
	Kagato coup.

Mitsuki:  {Looks over to Kiyone.}  Why are you still so nice to me, Kiyone?

Kiyone:  You don't remember that pact we all made in the academy, do you?

{Mitsuki thinks for a moment and then gasps in realization.  Kiyone nods.}

Kiyone:  {Looks into the distance.}  Yeah...  You, me, Mihoshi, Achi... All of us swore to be
	friends forever, remember?

Mitsuki:  Yes... but that was so long ago.  {Looks back to Kiyone.}  No one remembered it.

Kiyone:  {Looks back to Mitsuki.}  Except me and Mihoshi.  Mihoshi's been klutzy and naive, but
	she's been a good friend, almost like a little sister.  {Looks slightly away.}  You used
	to think of me that way...

Mitsuki:  {Sighs and looks away.}  You know.  A's death has really changed things.

{Kiyone looks over to Mitsuki quietly listening.}

Mitsuki:  My career always was first after the academy.  I moved up to the special
	investigations unit pretty quickly.  {Sighs.}  That's where I met him.  Quiet, strong...
	He was everything you ever wanted in a man, Kiyone.

{Kiyone nods as she continues.}

Mitsuki:  {Tears start to fall from her eyes.}  Then when Kain came...  everything changed...
	{Looks at her metal hand.}  everything...

{Kiyone puts her hand on Mitsuki's shoulder.}

Kiyone:  {Kindly.}  Mitsuki, forget it.  That's the past, and you can't live there forever.
	{Glances to the floor.}  I've forgiven you for what happened at headquarters, and I
	forgive you for breaking our promise.

{Mitsuki wipes her eyes and looks back to Kiyone's eyes as Kiyone looks into hers.}

Kiyone:  Let's make a new pact, you and me.

Mitsuki:  {Surprised.}  Kiyone, I...!

Kiyone:  Mitsuki, I know people change a lot, but I still believe that you are a good friend if
	you would loose your ambition and hatred.  I think you've lost your ambition.  I killed
	Kain.  Let your hatred die with him.

{Mitsuki looks away and closes her eyes tightly.  Kiyone looks on hopefully as Mitsuki takes a
long, cleansing sigh.  Mitsuki then nods.  Kiyone smiles at her old friend.}

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{The door to the MiB motorpool opens upward.  An MiB car pulls out onto the night street and
quickly changes forms and rockets away.  Cut to a field just outside New York.  The ground
cracks open and slides to either side of a rectangular hole.  At the bottom of this cavern is
the MiB hangar where Yagami and Mitsuki's patrolship are both docked.  Next to them, the Lyex
mech stands with a gantry to its head cockpit.  This gantry is removed as the feet start to
flare with fire.  The metal body lifts off and enters the sky while the hangar closes behind
it.  Zed's voice begins a voiceover with an amount of static like a radio transmission.}

Zed:  Illirg has been sighted outside New York in a pasture feeding on the cows being raised
	there.  Of course, approach him with extreme caution.

Ayeka:  We could sent the Lyex in first and gain his attention and lure him to the amplifier.

Kiyone:  That's actually a good tactical plan Ayeka.

Washu:  Oh!  One other thing about the amplifier!  It's got a time limit.  Because Ryoan and
	Juraian are so strong, especially together, the device will only have about fifteen
	minutes before it starts to overload.

Ryoko:  How will we know it's starting to overload?

Washu:  {Sarcastically.}  When starts melting.

{As the Lyex and MiB car move one over the other, both vehicles have teardrops appear on them.
Soon, the two reach the edge of New York and stop right before the farming communities.  The
car reverts to its original form.  The Lyex hovers over the car as Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka
file out of the car.  Tenchi goes to the back and opens the trunk and removes the amplifier.
Ryoko allows Ryo-Ohki to hop onto her shoulder.  Ryoko pets Ryo-Ohki as Ayeka folds her arms
and looks up to the Lyex high above.  Ryoko goes over to Tenchi.}

Ryoko:  Need any help carrying that, Tenchi?

Tenchi:  {Shakes his head.}  No, I've got it.  {Looks to both Ryoko and Ayeka.}  Are you both
	sure you're ready for this?

Ryoko:  {Nods.}  Of course!  This thing's got some serious karma to live up to!

Ayeka:  Yes, Tenchi.  I too have a debt to be paid back to this monster.

{Tenchi sets the device on the ground where it sprouts legs and stands ready for use.  Tenchi
turns back to Ryoko and Ayeka.}

Tenchi:  We all know the danger here.  I just want to say to both of you that...

Ayeka:  {Interrupts.}  Tenchi, do not say anything.  There will be time later to say all you
	want.

Ryoko:  {Smiles.}  Yeah, no bug's going to win this.

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Alright.  No sad thoughts then.

{Ryoko and Ayeka nod in unison as Kiyone's voice sounds from the Lyex's external speakers.}

Kiyone:  We'll go on ahead and engage Illirg.  Be ready for him!

{The Lyex flies into the distance.  Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka look to each other and nod.
Tenchi focuses his Jurai Power such that a blue aura surrounds his left hand.  A gold bracer
appears.  From this bracer, a golden disk emerges and passes over Tenchi's body changing his
clothes to his blue TM!iL battlesuit.  Ryoko does similar creating a red aura around the base
of her neck reveiling a golden neckplate from which also a golden disk appears and washes over
her body changing her clothes to her red TM!iL battlesuit.  Ayeka mimics them by creating a
pink aura around her waist reveiling a purple waistband that emits a disk that passes over her
replacing her clothes with her pink TM!iL battlesuit.  Tenchi holds the Tenchiken and looks off
after the Lyex.}

Tenchi:  Good luck.

{Cut to the Lyex's cockpit where Kiyone and J sit side by side manning the suit's controls.  J
looks over to Kiyone.}

J:  You ready, Kiyo?

Kiyone:  {Nods.}  As I'll ever be.

{J faces front and sighs heavily.  Kiyone angles her head towards him though keeping her eyes
set on the scanner screen before her.}

Kiyone:  What's wrong?

J:  {Shakes his head.}  Oh, nothing.  Just that everything's changed in my life so quickly.  I
	was just another New York street cop a few days ago.  Then I met my old MiB partner K.
	Then had to erase his memory of everything he did in the MiB.  {Sighs again.}  Just a lot
	so quick.

Kiyone:  {Smiles a little.}  You'd be surprised.  My life was turned upside down when I met my
	partner Mihoshi.  {Laughs to herself.}  You should have seen her on that first day.  I
	swear she was so naive of procedure and of conduct that I could have just killed her
	there!  {Shakes her head in fun.}  She's really a good person, just a little naive and
	innocent.

J:  Hey, that's cool.  I mean L back at HQ.  She's fine and all that, but she's real strong
	about herself.  I really need to get to know her better if I'm going to be her partner
	though.

Kiyone:  We're both cops here.  I think we can agree that partners can change your life like
	probably nothing else.

J:  {Nods.}  You hate 'em, but if you lose 'em, you kill the bastard that did it.

Kiyone:  Right.

{At that moment, a blip sounds on Kiyone's scanner.  She quickly takes the Lyex's controls
tightly and focuses on the visual ahead of her.}

J:  It's go time!

{J settles his hands on the firing and targeting controls and brings up a forward view with a
crosshair sight slowly locking onto a large black shape before them.  Outside, the Lyex's arms
come forward and aim at the large black shape which comes into color view soon.  Illirg's mouth
drips with the blood of the cow he just crunched in two with his jaws.  The hindquarters of the
cow are still in his claws when he looks over his shoulder and sights the Lyex approaching at
high speed.  Illirg's features twist into a frown.}

Illirg:  I'm trying to eat here...!!

{Illirg tosses the remains of the cow to the side and raises his arms, both regenerated to full
strength since the last battle.  He levitates off the ground and flies for the Lyex also at
high speed.   Illirg's outer skin changes to red and black patterns and tosses a red energy
bolt at the Lyex suit.  Lyex fires his right laser and nullifies the shot.  Lyex fires again
and the shot ricochets off Illirg's shields.  The two meet in the air and clamp onto each
other's arms.  They push against each other with all their strength, yet neither budge.  In the
Lyex cockpit, Kiyone raises her controls to their max and grits her teeth while J calmly
targets Illirg's thorax segment.}

Kiyone:  {To J.}  Make it fast, J!  I can't hold him here forever!

{The targeting system gets a lock.}

J:  Got him!!

{J pulls the firing switches.  Outside the Lyex, the left gunpod turn to Illirg's thorax and
open fire wounding him across the entire segment.  Illirg roars in pain as his face turns a
pale white.  The Lyex suddenly releases Illirg and flies away.  Illirg glares and bares his
teeth at Lyex as holds his wounds.}

Illirg:  You won't get away...!!

{Illirg enters a high speed flight and chases Lyex.  Within the Lyex cockpit, Kiyone
concentrates on the flying while J monitors Illirg behind them.}

J:  {Sarcastically.}  I think we pissed him off!!  Sure hope Tenchi and the girls are ready!

Kiyone:  Knowing them...  {Teardrops.}  They're probably not...

{Kiyone looks at her console again and sees Ryoko floating in the distance.  Ryoko lands and
joins Ayeka at the amplifier.  Tenchi hold the Tenchiken and generates the blue blade while
Ryoko summons red energy to her hands.  Ayeka's tiara glows green as she calls forth a green
light around her hands.  Kiyone smiles and accelerates the Lyex until it passes Tenchi, Ryoko,
and Ayeka's position.  Illirg continues at a raged pace as Ryoko and Ayeka release their
energies into the amplifier device.  The device then sends out a white beam that spreads and
shines its light across Illirg's form.  Illirg's shields start to turn grey and fall away as
his powers of flight suddenly give out causing him to crash into the ground.  The Lyex walks
over to Illirg and grabs his head.  Illirg grasps Lyex's arm only to have Lyex blast that arm
off with its laser.  J yells over the intercom.}

J:  Not so tough now, are ya?!

{Illirg takes his other arm and generates red energy ropes that he tosses around the Lyex's
frame.  It tries to pull free when Tenchi dashes up and slashes the cords with the Tenchiken's
blade.  Illirg staggers backward and grows even more enraged as he looks down at Tenchi.}

Illirg:  You Terran slime!!

{Illirg raises his foot to crush Tenchi when Tenchi jumps and slashes Illirg's foot causing
Illirg to fall backwards onto his back.  The Lyex stalks up to Illirg's side and aims its
weaponry at Illirg.}

Kiyone:  You are under arrest.  You have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and
	will be used against you in a court of law.  You also have a right to counsel.  If you
	cannot afford counsel, one will be appointed for you.

J:  And, you have the right to have your head blown off if you frickin' twitch!

{The Lyex teardrops.  The ground beneath Illirg starts to rumble as he yells at the top of his
lungs.  The Lyex quickly jumps into the air and hovers a distance away from Illirg.  Tenchi
runs over with Ryoko and Ayeka who are still sending energy through the amplifier.  Ryoko and
Ayeka look at each other concerned.  Illirg starts to melt away into a black mass.  A bright
red light splits the mass in two.  Everyone looks on as one side forms into an obsidian copy of
Kain, the other an obsidian copy of Kagato.  Tenchi's eyes lock onto Obsidian Kagato.  Ryoko
lowers her hands and ceases her energy as she glares at Obsidian Kagato.  Ayeka stops her
energy and raises her hands just over her mouth looking at both.  The amplifier device has
since turned red and begins to melt to the ground.  Both obsidian figures raise their hands to
the sky and yell out.}

Obsidian Kagato & Obsidian Kain:  Sister!!  Avenge me!!

{The Lyex simply raises its foot and crushes Obsidian Kain.  Tenchi grips his sword and then
looks to Ryoko as she forms hers.  Tenchi closes his eyes and nods as Ryoko flies to Obsidian
Kagato and cuts him clean diagonally.  Both obsidian figures melt into a green goo on the
ground.}

Tenchi:  {Sighs hard.}  That should be the end of Kain and Kagato... forever...

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  Let us pray that it is so.

{Ryo-Ohki hops out of the MiB car and scampers over to Ryoko and hops on her shoulder.  Ryoko
looks over to Ryo-Ohki and nods.  Ryo-Ohki meows knowingly and nuzzles Ryoko's face.  Ryoko
then stands over the puddle that was Obsidian Kagato and glares down at her reflection in the
sludge as her sword vanishes.  Suddenly, an Obsidian Ryoko splashes out of the ooze and grabs
Ryoko's throat.  Ryo-Ohki is startled off Ryoko's shoulder as Ryoko grabs the choking hands.
Tenchi quickly jumps and slices the fake Ryoko in half.  Ryoko pulls the black hands from her
throat and takes a deep breath with frightened eyes aimed at the ooze again.  Tenchi looks over
to Ryoko.}

Tenchi:  Ryoko...  {Touches Ryoko's shoulder.}  Ryoko...

{Ryoko is startled and looks back to Tenchi.  Tenchi's concern causes Ryoko to settle down.}

Ryoko:  I'm okay, Tenchi...  Thanks...

{Tenchi smiles some to Ryoko who, in turn, cracks a small smile back at him.  Ryo-Ohki hops
onto Ryoko's shoulder and meows relievedly to Ryoko.  Ayeka looks on somewhat left-out as
weapon fire is heard high above.  She looks up and sees flashes of light in the sky.}

Ayeka:  What is that...?

{Tenchi and Ryoko look over to Ayeka and follow her gaze into the sky as does Ryo-Ohki.  The
Lyex's head angles to the air also.  Within in the cockpit, Kiyone and J scan the skies and
lock onto two ships in combat.  J's targeting screen brings up a schematic of both ships.  One
is a Pentinon Militia Class Z10 fighter, the other a Pentinon Militia Class Z20 fighter.}

J:  Pentinon Militia...?  {Looks over to Kiyone.}  Who're they?

{Kiyone's expression hardens.}

Kiyone:  Something we didn't plan on.

{Kiyone opens a comlink to Washu in her lab, bringing up an image of Washu before her.}

Kiyone:  Washu, we've sighted two Pentinon Militia fighters above us.  Are there any carriers
	in this system?

Washu:  {Shakes her head.}  No, not a one.  Be on your guard, Kiyone.  We already know that
	Illirg was Nerti Ro's creation.  That might be his back up in case of failure.

Kiyone:  I understand.

{The comlink closes as the dogfight above them wages.  J looks over to Kiyone.}

J:  His back up?  Who'd back him up?

Kiyone:  His sister.

{Outside, Kiyone's voice is heard over the public address system of the Lyex.}

Kiyone:  We've confirmed two Pentinon Militia fighters in a dogfight with each other above us.
	It might be Mecha-Nerti coming to clean up Illirg's failure.

Ryoko:  What about the other ship?  They're fighting each other up there.

Tenchi:  If it's fighting her, the pilot could be a friend, right?

Kiyone:  There's no guarantee of that, Tenchi.  Even if one is our friend, we don't know which
	one it is.

{Within the cockpit, J looks at his monitor again and reads the word "Variable Geometry" under
the schematics for both Pentinon ships.}

J:  {Confused.}  Variable Geometry...?

{Fade from the schematics to the two ships in the sky.  While the five on the ground debate,
the Z20 chases the Z10 firing its weapons at every turn.  However, the Z10 skillfully avoids
every shot.  On the side of the Z10's cockpit, lettering reads "Rente Ro, Major" and "Caroki"
below that.  The Z20 then ceases its fire and starts to change forms into a mobile suit also.
All the cast on the ground turns to this sudden occurance as the Z20 suit accelerates to
overtake the Z10.  The Z10 spins around and fires its weapons into the Z20 damaging it somewhat
before the Z20 grips one of the engine exhausts and crushes it shut.  The Z10 falls towards the
earth below, but the ship angles its forward section up enough to sustain relatively minor
damage as it comes to a stop.  The Z20 then turns to the heroes and locks its weapons.  J's
voice raises from the Lyex.}

J:  I know you just didn't...!!

{Ryoko grabs Tenchi and flies away as the Lyex lifts into the air.  Ayeka jumps into the MiB
car when the Z20 opens fire on their old position decimating the remains of Illirg as well as
filling the MiB car full of holes.  Tenchi and Ryoko watch the Lyex and Z20 engage as Ryoko
hovers in the air holding Tenchi.  The Lyex locks arms with the Z20, and the two hold each
other at bay.  The Lyex tries to angle its right arm to blast the Z20 with its main cannon, but
the Z20 twists that arm away and rams its left arm through the Lyex's power cell, causing all
systems to fail.  Soon after, the cockpit pops open allowing both pilots to eject and float
towards the ground with parachutes.  The Z20 pulls its arm from the Lyex's hull and slams the
suit into the ground destroying it thoroughly.  The Z20 then turns and aims its weapons at the
defenseless Kiyone and J when a shot rings out from the downed Z10.  Tenchi and Ryoko turn to
see a boy their age standing in red armor with a blue bodysuit beneath, his face cloaked behind
a white cap and a black visor with a piece of black material over his left cheek.  His arms
have gauntlets with controls for the gear in the pack on his back while in his hands is a high
output laser rifle aimed right at the Z20 which is now smoking from a weapon impact to its
weapon array.  The Z20 turns to the boy and prepares to rush him when he fires again on the
suit's propulsion system.  The suit falls from the sky and lands hard and unmovingly against
the ground.  Tenchi and Ryoko land while Kiyone and J reach the ground safely.  All four walk
to the boy's location while Ayeka exits the nearly destroyed MiB car with a wound to her
shoulder.  She hurries to the others.  Tenchi sees Ayeka's wound and goes to her.}

Tenchi:  Are you alright, Ayeka?

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  It is nothing serious.  {Looks to the boy on the Z10.}  Thank you, kind sir.
	May I ask your name?

Boy:  {Quietly.}  People call me Evil Pii.

{Pii places the rifle on a hanger under his right arm and allows the pack to retract and store
the weapon.  Ryoko gains a slight glare at Pii while Kiyone looks to Pii with realization.}

Kiyone:  You're that boy from Pentinon, Will Pii, aren't you?  The one blamed for...

Pii:  {Nods.}  Yes, I am Will Pii.  I am also bounty hunter number 4401, detective.  I claim
	bounty over the criminal Mecha-Nerti.

{Pii starts to walk to the Z20 wreckage.}

Ryoko:  {Under her breath.}  Another bounty hunter...

Kiyone:  Well, Pii, this is a joint MiB/GP operation.  You're claim is invalid under Article
	Three, Section 4 of the MiB Charter.

Pii:  {Without turning back.}  But specifically, that reference states limits on "alien bounty
	hunters".  I am from Earth.  Therefore, my claim is equally valid as the MiB claim.

J:  {To Kiyone.}  That kid's a bounty hunter?!

{Kiyone nods as Pii reaches the Z20 wreckage.  A beam of energy cuts through the cockpit and
swipes downward.  Pii continues to walk towards the wreckage, now with a determined and angered
expression.  Pii presses a key on his right gauntlet, and his armor extends a weapon similar to
the rifle on his left side.  He draws it and pulls a pump action switch back and then forward
again.  The cockpit of the Z20 erupts in an explosion of metal and glass as a silver and gold
streak heads for Pii.  Pii rolls to the side and fires a blue blast from his weapon at the
streak.  The streak dodges the blast and returns to Pii stopping just before him, allowing the
blast to impact the ground and freeze in on contact.  The figure is a female body made entirely
of metal:  gold hair, silver skin, and bronze armor across her beautiful body.  In her hand is
a scythe with a razor edge and a pointed staff.  She smiles evilly into his face.  Pii replies
her evil smile with an almost enraged countenance.}

M.Nerti:  Hello, Father.  You remembered.

Pii:  Don't call me "father", Little Nerti...!

M.Nerti:  I thought I told you to call me Mecha-Nerti, my real name.  You do remember it since
	you and Mother picked it out just for me, your false child.

{Pii pulls the pump action on the weapon back again and leaves it there.}

Pii:  Just shut up and tell me where Nerti is before I destroy you.

Nerti:  {Laughs.}  You could not hurt me not matter how much you will yourself.  You could not
	bear to destroy the image of the one you care for.

{Pii's trigger finger shakes with tension as he yells at M.Nerti.}

Pii:  Dammit!  Tell me where Liaens has Nerti before I scrap you now!!

{M.Nerti suddenly swings her scythe up and knocks Pii's rifle to the side as he fires.  The
shot gouges through M.Nerti's scythe arm.  She uses her other arm to backhand Pii to the
ground.  M.Nerti holds her wound and glares down to Pii.  Pii rolls to his feet as M.Nerti
dashes up to him and grabs his chest with her strong arm as Pii grabs M.Nerti's neckline and
grips down crushing her frame.  M.Nerti's eyes glow a subtle red.}

M.Nerti:  How dare you hurt me!!

{M.Nerti's hand glows black.  Pii looks down and then back up enraged to her face.  The
blackness envelops Pii as the others look on.  Ayeka looks at the blackness and puts her hand
over her heart.}

Ayeka:  It cannot be...!!

{The blackness then turns to vapor and vanishes along with Pii.  M.Nerti looks over to the five
over by the "Caroki" Z10 fighter.  Her face returns to one that is calm and in control.}

M.Nerti:  Illirg analysis confirmed.  All are defiled by Terran disease.

{M.Nerti's eyes lock onto Tenchi and analyze him while her shoulder starts to slowly bend back
to its former shape.  M.Nerti's burned scythe arm has metal tendrils cover the wound and morph
to mimic the original materials.}

M.Nerti:  Juraian-Terran hybrid...  Tenchi Masaki...  {Smiles to herself.}  I never thought I
	would get the honor of dispatching you myself, Masaki.  Seems that my Mother and my Lady
	have chosen otherwise.

{Kiyone raises her blaster and aims at M.Nerti.}

Kiyone:  So, you're the Golden Goddess of Destruction.

M.Nerti:  {Nods.}  Many have called me that.  However, they were never able to call me that
	again.

{Tenchi and Ryoko both ready their swords and join Kiyone.  Ryo-Ohki hops to the ground and
hisses at M.Nerti.  J pulls his cricket and aims also.  Ayeka puts her hand on Tenchi's
shoulder.  Tenchi turns to see that Ayeka's hand is shaking.  Tenchi looks back to Ayeka with
concern.  Her face has a degree of fear written across it.}

Ayeka:  Tenchi...  we cannot stay here...  We need to regroup...

Tenchi:  Ayeka, what's wrong?

{Just then, M.Nerti flies at them all.  Kiyone and J fire only to have M.Nerti deflect their
shots with her scythe blade.  Ryoko flies at M.Nerti and meets her scythe with her sword.
However, even Ryoko becomes strained at holding M.Nerti at bay.  Ayeka pleads with Tenchi.}

Ayeka:  We must leave!  We cannot win this battle here!!

{Tenchi looks at Ryoko's struggle and then back to Ayeka.}

Tenchi:  Alright, I need to help Ryoko.  Can you get Ryo-Ohki ready to go?

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  Yes.

Tenchi:  {Turns to Ryoko holding his sword.}  Alright, we'll be right back.

{Tenchi runs toward Ryoko as Ayeka turns and picks up Ryo-Ohki.}

Ayeka:  You know we need to go now, do you not?

{Ryo-Ohki nods and meows affirmative.  Ayeka tosses Ryo-Ohki into the air where she transforms
into the crystalline ship Ryo-Ohki.  She teleports up Kiyone and J.  Ayeka looks back to Tenchi
and Ryoko worriedly.}

Ayeka:  Tenchi...

{Ryo-Ohki teleports up Ayeka and starts to head towards Tenchi and Ryoko.  Ryoko holds M.Nerti
when Tenchi swings at M.Nerti.  M.Nerti pushes Ryoko to the side and knocks Tenchi's attack to
the side.  Ryo-Ohki pulls over and teleports up Ryoko.  M.Nerti swings at Tenchi as Ryo-Ohki
teleports him up, and the scythe blade penetrates the ground and causes a small tremor.
M.Nerti pulls the blade out and looks up to Ryo-Ohki flying into the distance.}

M.Nerti:  You shall not escape me, Masaki.  You shall be the first casualty of a new RyoJurai
	War.

{Cut to black.}
