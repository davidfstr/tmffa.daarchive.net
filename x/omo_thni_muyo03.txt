Scene: Josue's temple, it was another fine and pretty day. Othni came 
out to breath some fresh air and do his morning exercises. 

Othni: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWL. {Makes him taking a big breath.} [ Mmmm. 
[It has passed one week since miss Kid had arrive. I don't know. but 
things had passed very fast. Mmm. Mmm I'm thinking that things will come 
fun now on.]  Mmmmm.
Kid: Fun? Well. It could really be fun I guess. {she appears in her 
back.}
Othni: AHHH!!!! {Jumps} Would you stop that please? You scared the heck 
out of me.
Kid: . Gome ne.
Othni: . mm I'm sorry I scream at you. sorry. {he said and sits at her 
side.}
Kid:. I think I like been here. everyone is nice in collage, and you 
brother and sister are kind people. But what happen to your parents?
Othni: .. Our. Parents died in a car accident. We where alone ever since 
then. I had fifth teen (15) at that time. And I had to take care my 
bother and sister by myself. I found a job and work in my studies too.
Kid: I see. I'm sorry. is a sad thing. but is so kind of you sacrificing 
yourself to help you brother and sister.
Othni: mmm. yeah. but no body sees that. {said in a sadness manner.}
Kid: . Don't worry. some one will.

They both went in silence for some seconds, but then in a shy way, Othni 
raise his arm and warp it in Kid's back. He got her by surprise but then 
she accept it and rest her head in his shoulder leaving a blush on 
Othni's chick. Then suddenly, Keni-ohki, the cute cabbit, jumps in 
Othni's lap maowying.

Othni" Hey buddy, wazup?
Keni: Mya. mya.
Kid: Hey Keni-chan. wants a carrot?
Keni: Mya mya mya!!! {Jumps in happiness.}
Othnielys: {appears from the door.} There you are! {goes to them and 
takes Keni in her hands} You bad boy. don't make me look for you again. 
it you bath time.
Keni: Mya mya mya!! Mya!!
Othnielys: Oh no. you will come! {takes him away.}
Othni and Kid: ...

Change Scene: Some time later, they four of them were eating breakfast 
on the table.

Josue: You cooking is still amaze me Kid-san. You are a fine chef I tell 
you.
Kid: Thank you very much. If you find it impressing, then I love to cook 
some more for you then. ^_^
Josue: You bet.
Othnielys: Yeah. is very good! You true are perfect to be Othni's wife!
<crash><goufffog>{Both Kid and Othni when they heard that shocked. Othni 
got troad stock with the food he was eating and Kid was blushing 
furiously and drop a plate from her hands that brake in the floor.}

Josue: HAHAHAHAHA! Come on Sis leave them alone. Anyway she cook better 
than  person I know that is in my side. Kid-san does not make poisonous 
food.
Othnielys: {stands in anger} WHAT DID YOU SAY??? I can cook! I only need 
a little bit of practice you stupid samurai-wannabe!!
Josue: yeah yeah yeah. _
Othnielys: GGRRRR!!
Kid: Come on guys calm yourself please.
{she tried to calm both of them mean while someone was watching in a 
tree the scene.}
May-Lin: ARG! That stupid bimbo. " Be nice Be nice" bah! I must brake 
that contract and make her pay!

Change Scene: Original World, Washu's lab, she was working with her 
dimensional machine.

Washu: Damn it. I can't still find which goddess world they are. If is 
ours. or. No it can't be ours. But I have still to make a plan to take 
them back. Damn it. ggrrrr!! {Hits the console in frustration.} There is 
no time left.

Change Scene: Goddess world. Othnielys took Kid into shopping. Josue 
went to train and Othni just wander around the house.

Othni was boring, and is a thing that makes him anxious. He had nothing 
to do, so he went to check the mailbox and found a little package. Othni 
took it and went to the house. In there he open the box and found a 
videotape.

Othni: Uh.? A Videotape. mmm what it said in here. " Problems in love? 
Ask the goddess of fortune and courage", mmmm.  who would send me such a 
thing. Maybe my classmates, man that piss me off. let's see. {He puts 
the tape in the video and press play.}

The screen turns on, and in there appear a beautiful woman with brown 
hair and brown eyes dressing in a fancy fortuneteller custom. And it had 
a crystal ball on a table. She looks around in her twenty's 

Woman: Hello there. do you have problems with love. and does not have 
courage to go for it? Well you are in the right place, follow my steps 
and you will be on the road.
Othni: Wow. and how beautiful she is.
Woman: Thanks but you already have a girl to look for.
Othni: Eh? What the heck.!?
Woman:. Yeah. you want to see good beauty? {She said while opens a 
little bit her shirts and signals him to come closer.}
Othni: mmm.. {blush} eh.. What's going on? {She said while getting 
closer to the screen.}

Suddenly a hand came out the screen and took Othni's shirt dragging him. 
Othni screamed and pulled back, then the Woman in the screen came out 
the TV and stands in front of him.

Othni: AHH! Who the heck are you!! And. how did you do that?
Woman: My My. my name is Vegean, nice to meet you Othni-san.
Othni: WHAT!? How you know my name?
Vegean: That does not matter now. I'm the goddess of love and courage. 
I'm here to help you with Kid.
Othni: H-h-h-h-help. me.?
Vegean: Yeah stupid. I was watching you and you are too slow, so I'm 
going to give you a hand.
Othni: Uh. and how you will do that if I may ask?
Vegean: {come close to him in a seductive way.} You'll see. first 
training. and when I take you, you will be a Don Juan from then on. 
Othni: Glglglg!! {she hugs him pushing her chest to him} AAAAHHH!!!! 
{big nose bleed and blacks out in the floor.}
Vegean: {stands frustrated with her hand on her face} My my. You're so 
weak boy. How do you think you will get Kid if you are so shy.? Come on. 
wake up.. wake up. {she moves him} Hey wake up stupid! {starts slapping 
him} WAKE UP I'M TELLING YOU!!! {She starts hitting him with a hammer.} 
Ok! This goes to a higher manner! {takes out a bazzoka.} Ok here goes!
Othni: I'M UP I'M UP DON'T SHOOT!!!
Vegean: hehehe. always works.. {Hides the gun} Well. now that you are 
awake. I have and Idea to say. Why you don't invite Kid into the beach?
Othni: Beach?
Vegean: yes. salt water, huge place, fun.. girl in bathing suit and boys 
too. ya know. is a perfect place.
Othni: Beach. eeehhh to see. her.. Bathing suit.? {she nodes.} eee.. 

Othni starts dreaming and imagining Kid in a bikini with him, running in 
the coast holding hands and her in bikini, then taking a sun tang, and 
her in bikini, and running a boat alone in the water, and her in bikini, 
and watching the sun set, and did I already said her in bikini? Well 
Othni then had another nosebleed but was stopped by the toilet paper in 
her nose.

Vegean: Hey.. hey.. hello. snap out of it stupid!
Othni: ah eh oh ah?
Vegean: You didn't say 'ih'. you didn't complete the vocals. Anyway, are 
you going to do it or not?
Othni: Ok.
Vegean: Fine, then I'll help you out. {Then both starts hearing voices} 
Ops. I guess she is back. Well I have to go, and don't tell my little 
sister that I was here ok?
Othni: SISTER!?!?!?
Vegean: Yes. {Makes a good bye reverence.} I'm the great "Vegemoon"  
Vegean at your service. {Then she starts disappearing in the floor.} And 
throw out that tape I send you. it could give you trouble.
Othni: But. hey WAIT! {she was gone.} mm damn.
Othnielys: WE ARE HOME!!! Hey Oniisama, What are you doing?
Othni: Mmm. nothing, just thinking.
Kid: Lunch will be ready soon. I'll start doing it.
Othnielys: I'll help!
Kid: ok.
{Both go away.}
Othni: Mmmm. beach. sounds great.
{Later, Lunch was ready and they where eating.}

Othni: I have a preposition to do. Let's go to the beach! We can have 
time since tomorrow will be Sunday.
Othnielys: Beach?  That's a great idea.
Kid: Beach? What is a beach?
Josue: Is the Ocean. the grate place of water that surrounds Earth? {she 
still confuse} You don't know what is? Where have you been? In the 
mountains?
Othni: AH EH UHM EH!! Well Yes. she is a Hill billy! [I hope they bit 
that] {but still they don't.}
Othnielys: mmmm Well Kid-san, is a place where the water is salty but is 
a lot of fun.
Kid: Really? I'll like to see it.
Josue: Mmmmm.. {Whisper to Othni} Hey. what's the idea? You never wanted 
to go to the beach before because you can't swim.
Othni: {whisper back} Well is nice to change for sometime. 
Josue: What I see is that you want to see Kid in a bathing suit ah?
Othni: GRLRLGFGSF!! {spit his rise.}
Josue: HAHAHA! I knew it. Well Kid-san you have to wear a bathing suit 
on it.
Kid: Bathing suit?
Josue: v_v Sis. explain and show her. go to the room.
Othnielys: Ok. Come Kid-san I'll show you.
{They both went to the rooms leaving the two men in the table. Josue was 
looking suspicious toward Kid and then look at Othni who was trying to 
clean what he had done.}
Josue: mmmm. [Something is fishy here with that girl.].
{in the outside}
May-Lin: Great! Beach. sun and fun! And my revenge!
{Later on time}
Kid: I don't know. do you think is a little bit revelative?
Othnielys: Is ok, that is how normal bathing suit goes. revelatives are 
bikinis and stuff.
{They where chatting and Kid was wearing a red one peace bathing suit.}
Othnielys: You look pretty on it too girl, you will give Othni a heart 
attack.
Kid: Oh my! Then I could not wear it. I don't want to kill him!
Othnielys: HAHAHA! Don't worry. I was only saying it. I mean, you will 
leave him in shock.
Kid: Oh. ok then, when do we leave to the beach?
Othnielys: Othni said in this afternoon. We'll use Josue's Van.
Kid: Mmm.

stay one night. A house with two rooms, one to the boys and one for the 
girls. 

Josue brought his girlfriend, Veronica,  and was ready to go when 
Othnielys came to him to ask if she can go with them to leave the couple 
alone. He nodded and they leave Othni and Kid alone. Kid wasn't ready so 
she told Othni to wait for her in the beach. Othni went to the beach to 
look for a spot and found a nice one. Then Suddenly two hands covered 
his eyes.

Voice: {female} Hello Othni. Did I make you wait for so long?
Othni: uh!? K-K-K-Kid-san? {she was feeling a female chest pressing on 
his back.}
Voice: Sort of stupid.

Vegean: Good. ok here she comes.. bye. {she goes away.}
Kid: {appears running toward him} Othni-san Othni-san!!!
Othni: WHAAAAA!!!!!! 0_0 {He sees her in the red bathing suit and was 
shock. All Guys on the beach look toward the couple and felt jealousy 
toward Othni.} 
Kid: Sorry to be late. so this is the beach, is a nice place. {she sits 
at his side.}
Othni: mmm. oh yeah, the bottle. hey Kid-san, you want me to put some 
sun block?
Kid: uhm? Ok. {She turns around giving her back to Othni.}

Othni glups and but some cream in his hands. And then his heart starts 
to bump fast, his hands starts to shake while getting close. But when he 
was about to put some in here. someone appears. It was May-Lin.

May-Lin: Prepare yourself Hikaru! I shall have my revenge!!!
Othni: WHAT THE HECK!?

BOTTLE IS EMPTY!!. Shut. my luck!]
Vegean: {in a corner} THAT STUPID BOY!!. Damn.. May-Lin is here too. I 
must watch them. I don't like this. Well it is time for Beach plan B.

Change scene: Kid and Othni were in a boat ride. Othni was pulling the 
pedals while Kid was touching the water with her hands.

Othni: [ I hope this plan works. but why Vegean send us in a boat ride? 
And this is dangerous for me.] {he looks toward the coast} AH! We are 
getting far. must return.
Vegean: {in the coast sit in a sun tang shear. Then she took out a

{Back to the couple.}

position.

Othni: [AAAHH!! This.. this.. this is a compromising position! This was 
Her plan!?!? Man. I think I'm going to pass out.]
Kid: {she was blushing} ehm.
Othni: . Kid-san. I. I.
Kid: ...
{Their faces starts to get closer and closer.}
May-Lin: Oh no you won't! {Makes a energy wave that hits the water and

Veronica: Oh no! Josue-chan, help him hurry!
Josue: ok! Were is he? {Vegean shows the way} Ok! {Josue runs with all

Othni: {Sinking in the water.} [HELP ME.]
Kid: OH MY!! OTHNI-SAN! {she dive into the water and swim looking of

Josue: {arriving} Kid! Is he alright!?
Kid: I don't know! {she said almost crying.} 
{Josue took him and swim toward the coast.}

Change Scene: Later, it was getting dark. Othni was on the bed 
unconscious and Kid was to his side in sadness. 

Kid: . [I'm sorry. It was my fault, I'm not so good help as I thought.] 
I'm sorry.
Othni: ggglglr. {Open his eyes slowly} Why are you. apologizing.?
Kid: Othni-san!! Are you all right?
Othni: yeah. I'm fine.
Kid: I'm sorry. I should save and protect you. I failed.

Kid: . sniff. I. I. I will go outside and take some air. I'll buy some 
ice though. I'll come back later.{she stands and goes outside.}
Othni:. Kid-san.

Othni:. I'm sorry. I think. I'm not good at this.
Vegean:. Ok. last option. here. {gives him a little bottle} drink this 
and you will have all the courage to tell my sister what you feel.
Othni: mmm. Are you sure? What is this anyway.
Vegean: Is a love potion. but you are too coward to have the guts to 
tell. That will help you, but is an option anyway. Well good luck. bye.. 
{Disappears}
Othni: WAIT!! Damn. {Look the bottle} mmm. It is the only option. then. 
{He brakes de top and drink it.} Now to wait for Kid to come.
May-Lin: {appears braking the door.} OK HIKARU!! I'M HERE TO FIGHT!

Othni: {With roses in the background} You're so beautiful. {his eyes

May-Lin: Excuse me? [Wait. I thought of something. If I drag the kid's 
attention. I can make her suffer! YES! I'm so brilliant!] {But suddenly 
Othni hugs her in a seductive way} Ahhh!?!? What the hell do you think

Othni: You are so beautiful! Ever since I saw you. I fall in love with 
you! [What the heck I'm saying. my body is reacting against me.. help

Vegean: {In mini mode in a corner} Oops. did I just gave him the wrong 
love potion? Oh well.. must get out of here. <puff>{disappears} 
May-Lin: {blushing} Hey stop it! [This wasn't in the plan. I guess I 
over react in my beauty temptation. Well is not my fault I'm so

Othni: I won't I love you! [What the heck!? I even don't know her!!

May-Lin: Hey let me go!! What if Hikaru sees us like this!?!?
Othni: I don't care. is it you who I want. come to my arms. {Then he 
slowly got close at her.} I love you. [AAAAAHHHH!!!!!!] {Othni kisses 
May-Lin passionately in her lips. She gasps on it and went in shock.}
Voice: AAAHH!! <Crash>
May-Lin: UH!? {she separate herself from him. Then she look toward who 
screamed and saw Kid in shock and almost to cry.}
Kid:.. Why. why. Othni-san. I thought. I thought.
Othni: {looking in a zombie way} .eee. [Kid san no!! No, is not what it 
looks like! I'm been controlled, please!!! Help!!]
Kid: I see. that. I'm in your way. well then. I'll just go.
Othni: [NO!!] ggllhhll {his face urn in shock and then he suddenly hold 
his head in pain} Aahhhh! AAAAARRGHH GGHHAAAA ARGGGHH!! {Shakes in 
pain.}
Kid: AH!?? OTHNI-SAN, WHAT'S GOING ON!?

Othni still screams in pain, and drop something and starts running away 
leaving both. Kid took the tiny bottle he dropped.

Kid: A love poison. so this was it? So Vegean is here? I must look for 
Othni-san before something happens!! {she starts running.}
May-Lin: {Half day dreaming}... [He kissed me. in front of her. this is 
even good that I thought. and. he kissed me. what. what is this feeling 
I'm having. Am I. Am I in love.?] {Then something snaps on her} uh?  A 
LOVE POTION!?!? So it was Vegean's fault! I'll teach her!! GRRRR!!! 
{Disappears}

Othni keeps running away and crashing with anything that comes in his 
path. Still holding his head in pain, his course was toward the beach. 
Kid flew toward him and stops him before he went to the water.  Kid user 
her strength to hold the young boy that was staring to get in 
convulsions. Othni gave a loud scream and passes out. Kid put him on the 
rock.

Kid: Othni please. be all right! Please!!! {Then she looks mad toward 
the sky} Sister I know you are there. show yourself!
Vegean: {appears levitating} My My. so you discover me. To bad this 
happened. it was an accident.
Kid: How dare you to harm Othni-san! I won't aloud it! Even if you are 
my sister! {charges a energy ball and shoots toward her in a explosion. 
Vegean dodge it and look toward her.} 
Vegean: Hey hey!! Don't get mad Hikaru! It was an accident I tell you!
Kid: You always mess up things! Now change Othni-san to the way he was.
Vegean: I'm afraid I can't.
Kid: WHAT!?
Vegean:. The kid got a brain shock for what happen. he can't wake up by 
the shock of the poison.
Kid: DON'T TELL ME THAT HE.!!!
Vegean: {join her hands like a pray} Gomen.
Kid: {take Othni in his hands} Othni-san. I fail. I fail you. and didn't 
believe you. I don't deserve to be here with you. forgive me Othni-san. 
now is my fault that you are like this. please don't die. {Starts 
crying} Please. become normal again. that's my wish. please.
Vegean: {in the air}...
Kid: . please. {she closer her face to him and kiss Othni in his lips.}
Vegean: [YES!!!!!!! WOOOHOOO!!]
Othni: {opens his eyes} uhm.? Kid-san.?
Kid: {gasp and look at him.} Othni-san!? OTHNI-SAN!!! {she hugs him} YOU 
ARE OK!!! I THOUGH YOU WERE GOING TO DIE!! {she starts crying on his 
shoulder.}
Othni: mmmm. I'm fine. and. sorry about before.
Kid: Is ok. is ok. don't worry now.{they hug each other.}
Vegean: Well. my job is done. Time to go back.

Suddenly the sky fills with clouds and bolts, then a lightning strike in 
the place and we can hear Vegean scream. The camera change to the scene 
and we can se an electrocuted Vegean in cartoon style and a message 
written in the floor.

Kid: {got close to her and read the message} Uhm. is form the Lord. it 
says, " Vegean, you left your post and I saw everything, the Fate 
machine crashed by your fault and you will be punished. I degrade your 
license and you can't come back to Midgard until the machine gets 
repaired and I say so." 
Vegean: eeeeee @_@
Othni: Oh my.
Kid: Well that gets you for trying to " help" sister. But now where are 
you going to stay.?
Othni: Oh no. v_v
Kid: Well I'll ask Josue-san to let you stay in our place.
Othni: [Damn. two goddess in our place? One sweet and the other mess up 
things. what a luck I have.] mmmm. v_v
Vegean: OOOOOOK!!! {appears in their back hugging both} I'll be glad to
