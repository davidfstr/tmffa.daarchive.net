                                   by The Ksawarrior
                                       Prologue


Disclaimer: Ranma 1/2, Tenchi Muyo!, Ushio and Tora, and Flame of Recca are properties of their
respected owners. Events, characters, and other things are mine. Sue me not, for I have nothing
to be sued for.



The lone warrior stood there, the last chance the universe had.
A good 15 meters away, stood the demon, Erax, with blazing yellow hair, and a purple martial arts
gi. "Give it up, Korlin!" he yelled, "You can't hope to beat me!"
Korlin was a proud and strong warrior, with a blazing fist covered in flame. The other hand, held
a mystical sword. His black hair, though tied in a pigtail that went to his waist,
was flaying to and fro.
"I won't let you win that easy!" he screamed as he put the last of his energy 
into his next attack. "FINAL ATTACK! 4 AS 1 DESTRUCTION WAVE!!!"
As he uttered the words, 4 creatures made of ki fired from his body. A blue hawk, a red tiger 
beast, a ice cold dragon and another dragon of flame flew at Erax, blasting him to hell.
Korlin fell down, and with the last of his strentgh, the 4 creatures, the four essecences of his
soul, flew from his body.

The priests found his will, saying:
----------------------------------------------------
If I have won against Erax, know well that he will return, to continue his mad ambition of ruling
all of creation. That will be the reason I seperated my soul into the four creatures of my attack
and scattered them. They will manifest themselves into souls of their own. 
Each shall go to a different man, all I know is what my visions have told me.

The Hawk, the passive and gentle essence, shall belong to a swordsman, kind and noble, a prince 
from the stars themselves.

The Tiger, essence of loyalty and friendship, will go to a man who, through bizzare secumstances,
shall be friends with a demon. They may fight, but the man is loyal to his friend.

The Ice Dragon, the confidence, shall go to a fighter, who is divided in his own way. Cocky and arrogant
he may seem, but he is the one who will never give up.

The Fire Dragon, courage, shall go to a fiery youth, who will strech to the limits to protect those dear
to him.

When Erax returns, call these men, and their allies together. They will be the ones to destroy 
Erax at last.
---------------------------------------------------------------

The priests have waited for when they must gather these 4 together to save all creation as its 
known.

Centuries later, the time came.

"Do you sense it Etah?" one priest asked his friend.
"Yes, Ts'rith. The time has come at last." Etah replied.
"We must gather the warriors now."
The two gathered an orb of spiritual energy to show them the 4. As they saw them, they took them
and whoever was with them at the time.

"Tenchi! Can't you forget your chores and stay with me?" Ryoko said as she held Tenchi's shirt
and floated alongside him.
"Miss Ryoko, I demand that you remove yourself from Lord Tenchi at once!!"
"Oh yeah, Ayeka? Who's going to make me?"
*Great* Tenchi thought. *Nothing like a fight to start the morning off*
Suddenly he felt something. A strange, yet familiar feeling.
"GET OUT OF HERE!!! GO!!!!" he yelled to the girls. They turned to him, and notice the white glow
coming at them. 
Then they vanished.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Well I hope you're happy, fuzz for brains!!" Ushio yelled at Tora. Tora had attacked the TV when
it showed the 3rd Impact of the EVA movie.
"That white girl was going to destroy the world!! I had to stop her!!"
*God, you'd think he'd have learned by now!* Ushio paused and felt strange.
"What the hell is that!?!" Tora growled as he and Ushio were sucked into a white glow.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Why does this always happen to me?* Ranma had a bad morning. First Akane tried to experiment her
toxic stew on him, then Ryoga came and started a fight over him "disgracing his right to be with
Akane", and now he was in battle with both Ryoga, and Pantyhose Taro, who was in his monster form.
They all stopped as a white glow swooped down, causing them to disappear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Go Recca-kun! You can win! Take him down!"
Recca loved it when Hime cheered him on. And he needed all the cheering he could get. It seemed 
as if Tokiya has been putting in extra training with Ensui. Not that his Flame couldn't take it, of
course.
A white beam shot down, taking Recca and Tokiya away.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"We are successful, Ts'rith." Etah said.
"Indeed we are."
The group of people were kinda in the middle of a lot fighting. Most of them, anyway.
Recca had burned Taro who attacked him as a result. Ranma and Ryoga were in a battle royal, with 
Ayeka, Ryoko and Tora.
Tenchi, Tokiya and Ushio stood by the side lines and watched.
"This happen alot with you?" Ushio asked the other two.
"So much that it no longer worries me" Tenchi said.
Tokyia had turned his attention to the two priests. "We'll break it up as soon as it slows down a
bit."
Etah and Ts'rith were begining to wonder if they should have actually done this.
