Homer is at work sleeping.  "Hey Homer wake up!" Lenny said. "It's time 
for our break."  Homer woke up and yawned and popped his back and his 
neck and his arms. "Whoo! That's the last time I ever sleep on a rock 
and thought it would be different." Lenny, Homer and Carl went into the 
lounge and the food there was old and had mold all over it. "Ew! What is 
this crap!" Homer said squning at the site of the food. "Looks like 
Burns forgot to get some more food." Carl said. Then Mr Burns came on 
the speeker asking for everyone to come into his office. Everyone 
reports to the office. 

"My fellow empolyees. I have seen all over you at work and I've seen no 
effort what so ever that's why I will not give yummy delious food until 
I see some impovment. Now get out of my office you lousy bums!"

"Aw great there goes our food." Homer said. Then all of a sudden the 
plant starts to shake. "What's going on?" Mr. Smithers said. The plant 
started to shake and the alarms started to go off. Then a man came into 
the lobby running. "The plant is falling apart! Run for your lives!" 
Everyone ran the opposite direction of the flowing acid comming out of 
the doors. Mr. Smithers screamed like a girl and ran into Mr. Burns' 
office closing the door as the acid was eatting through the door and 
burning his hands. Mr. Burns was sitting in his chair at the time. 
"Smithers! What are you doing?" He said cracking in back standing up.
Smithers couldn't hold the door any longer and all the acid flowed 
through the door as Smither's jumped on Mr' Burns to block the acid. 
Meanwhile, Homer and the empolyees started to run outside as the whole 
Powerplant fell down. "Aw man and I had a Burrito in the microwave." 
Homer said crying. 

********************************************************

Later on the bus on with Bart talking to Millhouse. "
"Hey Millhouse gusse what I got from the comicbook store?" Bart said 
with a smile on his face. "What?" He said looking at Bart with an 
excited face. Bart pulled out a spray bottle and sprayed it in Milhouses 
face. "Ah! Bart! I'm blind!" Milhouse screamed rolling on the floor. 
Bart laughed. "Milhouse it's not even pepperspray it's water with pepper 
in it. It should be harmless." Milhouse was lying on the floor. "He 
stood up and looked around and took off his glasses. "Hey! I can see 
without my glasses! Wow Bart you are a true friend!" Then the bus hit a 
huge bump and throwing all the kids across the opposite sides of the 
bus.
Otto, the bus driver had hit a pothole and got a flat as the bus started 
to spin and everyone on the bus was screaming. Sherry and Terry was 
holding on to each other. Rahlf was hidding under a seat Bart and 
Milhouse was holding on to the seat they were sitting on. The bus turned 
upside down and everyone was rolling all over the bus. The windows 
started to break and a piece of glass flew into Milhouse's eye.
"AH! MY EYE!" Milhouse screamed. Then Milhouse was gonna be thrown into 
the back of the bus but Bart caught him on time. "Hold on Milhouse!" 
Bart said.  Lisa was holding on the her friend Janie's hand. "Hold on 
Lisa!" Janie said. "Pull me up the the seat." Janie pulled with all her 
might to the seat with her Sherry And Terry. The bus then flipped back 
over and crashed into the police station. All the kids sat up rubbing 
their heads and backs. Bart was trying to get the piece of glass 
launched in Milhouse's eye. As Bart yanked it out Milhouse yelled. "OW! 
MY EYE! I'M BLIND AGAIN! WHERE'S MY GLASSES?" Milhouse franticly looked 
for his glasses. Bart held them up and put them on Milhouse. The glasses 
was broken and Mlhouse still couldn't see anything. Otto the bus driver 
was still in the drivers seat. He unbuckled his seat belt and feel to 
the ground. "Is everybody ok?" Everyone was fine except for Milhouse. 
"Ok kids. You wll be hoofing it home cause this bus ain't going 
nowhere." All the childrens on the bus got off and started for home.

"Man! This bites!" Nelson Muntz said. 
"Yeah! If we didn't have such a cheap city we would all be home by now." 
Marten said.
As the kids were walking home they saw millions of potholes everywhere. 

******************************************************

When Homer, Bart, and Lisa got home they were all dirty and tired. They 
all ploped into the living room. Marge came into the living room and was 
in shock. 
"Oh my Lord! What happened to you guys?" Marge said running to Bart and 
Lisa.
"Our stupid bus tipped over after it hit a pothole." Lisa said
"Yeah and a piece of glass flew into Milhouse's eye." Bart said
"Oh my. Homer what happened to you?" Marge said sitting on the couch. 
"The nucler powerplant feel down today and I lost my burrito. OH WHY MY 
BURRITO?! WHY?!" Homer said sobbing again.
"It's ok Homy. I have a nice burrito in the oven for you." Marge said. 
Homer got up imediately and ran into the kitchen. Marge sighed.
"This town is in such bad shape." Marge said. "I went to the grocery 
store today and the shelves were creaking. They almost feel on top of 
me." Then there was a sudden knock at the door. It was Mayor Quimby.
"We have a town meeting tonight about how bad of shape this town is."
Quimby said handing Marge an invatation. "The meeting is tonight. All of 
Springfield will be seperate all around the country cause even the state 
is in bad shape. We will give you your assinmets tonight. Please don't 
miss it. PS: Vote for me." The Mayor left in his limo and zoomed to the 
Flanders house. Marge closed the door and called everyone into the 
living room telling them we have a meeting and we have to hurry. The 
camera zooms to Springfield City Hall. The Mayor was baning the gavel to 
the desk. "Quiet everyone!" The Mayor said standing on the post. "This 
town and this state is in bad shape. So we must all scatter everyone to 
a different state because it's cheaper. Now here are your assinments." 
The Mayor started to read everyones their assiment. The Flanders was 
assined to Florida. "Aw man! Why does Flanders get Florida! Why don't 
you just give him Hawaii or France Hell why don't you give him Asia! 
Yeah! Give him Asia!" Homer said standing up. Lisa tuged on Homer's 
shirt. "Dad! Asia and France isn't a state." Homer patted on Lisa's 
head. "Lisa the grown-ups are talking right now." The Mayor banged his 
gavel on the stand. "Sir! Please sit down or I'll send you to Alaska!" 
Homer immedeately sat down. After the Mayor assined everyone a state, 
The Simpsons was the last one left. The Mayor had a worried look on his 
face. "Simpsons, It seemed that you have been banned by every state, 
even Alaska and you haven't been their yet. There's only one place to 
send you to. Japan. The Simpson gasped. 
"Man we already been to Japan." Bart said.
"Yeah, and we were misserable." Lisa said.
The Mayor crossed his arms. "Well you just have to go there again." 
Everyone was dissmissed and went home to pack for their plane.
"Man I can't belive we have to go to Japan again." Bart said to Lisa 
while dragging his suitcase down the stairs.
"Well, we'll be down there for just a week then we can come back home." 
Lisa said down stairs waiting by the door. Bart was dragging his 
suitcase and let go of it for a second. Homer was walking downstairs and 
tripped over Bart's suitcase and fell all the way downstairs all most 
crashing into Lisa.
"OW! MY BACK!" Homer said standing up. Marge ran out of the bedroom. 
"Homer!" She yelled "Are you ok?"
"Yeah. The boy left his suitecase in the middle of the floor." Homer 
said glaring at Bart.
"We don't have time for this!" Marge said helping Homer up. "We have to 
catch the plane to Japan or we're gonna be living on the streets. Move 
move move." Marge hurried everyone out the door. Homer drove to the 
airport when there was traffic.
"Oh no!" Marge said. "We're gonna miss our plane." 
"The Hell we are!" Homer said pushing on the pedle and drove on the 
grass and there was traffic there.
"D'OH!" Homer said.
"Look!" Lisa said pointing to the open space leading to the airport.
Homer turned to the space Lisa was pointing at and it leaded into the 
airport parking. The Simpsons grabbed their suitcase and ran to the 
airport entrance. The plane to Japan was departing. The Simpsons got 
their seats and was off to Japan.
"Hey mom!" Lisa said "Tell Bart to stop poking me!"
"Bart stop poking Lisa!" Marge said
"Hey! What family are we staying with." Bart said
"We're staying with the Ma- Masikyasdfd family." Homer said
Lisa glanced at the invation. "We're staying with the Masaki family."
Lisa took the Brocher from Homer to read the letter from a boy named 
Tenchi.
"This says that they own a shrine and they live in the woods. Tenchi 
lives with his father. His mother died a long time ago. He also lives 
with his grandpa and- Holy Moly! 6 singel women!"
Bart yanked the Brocher from Lisa.
"Aye Carumba!" He said
Lisa snatched the brocher from Bart.
"They are all to old for you except for Sasami. She's 8. Like me!" Lisa 
said.
"So, Younger women are my thing." Bart grabbed the brocher from Lisa. 
"Hey! there's pictures in the back." Lisa grabbed it from Bart and they 
started to fight over it. Then finnaly they both ripped it.
"Look what you did!" Lisa said.
"What I did?" Bart said. "Look what you did."
"Will you 2 please shut up." Homer said. "You aren't the only one on the 
plane you know." Homer then grabbed a meal someone else was eatting. 
"Hey! That's my plate." The man said sitting next to Homer.
"Well, I don't see your name on it." Homer said countieusly eatting.
Marge sighed and prayed that they will be there soon and her family will 
behave. Finnaly the plane hit Japan and the Simpsons were driving on 
their way to the Masaki house. A Local taxi cab was taking the Simpsons 
to Japan. Maggie started getting restless and started squrming. Finally 
they arrived at the Masaki shrine. Homer and the cab driver argued about 
the bill from the airport to the Masaki household. 
"60,000 yen! Are you nuts! I don't have that kind of money!" Homer said.
"Then you shall give me 1 American doller!" the cab driver said. Homer 
gave the $1 to the cab driver and mutterd some swears.
"Ah! Here we are. The beutiful likings of Japan and wonderful sceanery."  
Lisa said with eyes sparkling. Then in frount of them was a whole flight 
of stairs.
"AH!" Homer screamed. "No one said there would be walking! I hate 
walking!"After the Simpsons finaly made it to the to the top of the 
stairs they were all out of breath. Maggie pulled out a hanky wiped her 
face and sucked on her bottle.
"Aw man!" Homer said holding his heart. "I haven't seen some many steps 
since the white house." 
"Hello." a young boy said while the Simpson was on the ground gasping 
for air.
"My name is Tenchi and this is the home you will be living in." The boy 
pointed to the house. It was just like the Simpsons house but a little 
bit bigger.
"We sort of have a lot of guest so it might be a little crowded." Tenchi 
said with his hand behind his head. 
"It's ok man." Bart said with a charming look on his face. "I can handle 
anything." Then all of a sudden a giant bomb came from the house Tenchi 
was pointing at. Then a pail blue haircame flying out of the window that 
was blown away.
"Whoa! I think I'm gonna like it here." Bart said rubbing his hands 
together. Then a purple haired woman jumped out of the window screaming 
something but it was fuzzy cause it was far away. Then they started to 
come closer when they were fighting. Then the blue-haired woman threw a 
big glowing ball towards the other woman but missed and it was heading 
towards Bart who wanted to get a closer look at the action. Then Tenchi 
saw the ball was heading right towards him and then he pushed  Bart out 
of the way of the huge blast pushing Tenchi and Bart away from the 
deadly ball of death. Bart and Tenchi coughed of the smoke and ash from 
the blast. Marge came running towards Bart and Tenchi.
"Oh my God! Bart are you ok?" Marge said hugging Bart to death.
"Mom! Mom I'm ok." Bart said dusting hiself off.
"Tenchi! Oh Thank you very much for saving my special little guy." 
Tenchi then ran flashbacks in his mind from him and his mother. Then he 
shook them out of his head.
"Thank you Mr. Tenchi sir." Lisa said bowing. "My brother may be an 
idiot but he's a good kid."
"No problem uh...what's your name?" Tenchi said scratching his head.
"My name is Lisa." Lisa said bowing once again. Then pointing to Bart. 
"That's my brother Bart. (Then pointing to Homer) My father Homer 
Pointing to Marge.) and my Mother Marge."
"Nice to meet you all." Tenchi said.
"Yeah Yeah!" Homer said becoming bored and Magie getting worse. "Can we 
go inside now?"
The blue haired woman and the purple haired woman ran over to the group 
and stopped right over in Tenchi's face.
"Oh Tenchi I'm so sorry!" They both said. "It was her fault. Was not! 
Was too!"
"Enough of this!" Tenchi said. "This is the family who's gonna live with 
us and I don't want any trouble from you 2." Tenchi said. Ayeka and 
Ryoko looked at the family then looked at Bart.
"AW! HE'S SO CUTE!" Ryoko said picking up Bart and pinching his cheek. 
Ayeka pushed Ryoko away and grabbed Bart. "Why aren't you the cuteiest 
little thing!" 
Tenchi grabbed Bart from Ayeka and put him on the ground.
"I'm sorry. Let me show you to your rooms."

"FINALY!" Homer yelled. "Geez...I thought we were gonna stay out here 
forever."
"Homer!" Marge said glaring at Homer.
"What?!" Homer said "But I'm tired and I miss my burrito."
"Oh Homer!" Marge said rolling her eyes. "Will you just forget about the 
burrito."
Tenchi lead the family into the house and showed them to there room. 
Lisa and Bart had to share a room with Mihoshi and Kiyone. Ryoko had to 
move in with Ayeka which wasn't easy to do. So Homer and Marge will have 
a room to themselves.
"Hey Bart! Keep your stuff on your side of the room." Lisa said throwing 
Barts Krusty the clown doll at him.
"Hey! Then keep your crap on your side!" Bart said throwing her Malabu 
Stacy Doll at her and it hit Lisa in the face.
"Ow! Mom! Bart's throwing things at me!" Lisa yelled out the door.
"Stop It Bart!" Marge said from downstairs reading a book.
"She started it!" Bart said pushing Lisa out the door.
"Stop It Lisa!" Marge said still reading her book.
"Hey Marge!" Homer said from the upstairs. "Have you seen my walky-
talkie!?"
"It's in your pocket Homer!" Marge said still stuck in the book.
"Thank You!" Homer said.
Ayeka walked over to Marge.
"Do you deal with that everyday?" Ayeka said sitting next to Marge 
giving her a cup of tea.
"Yes." Marge said "It's part of having a family." 
Marge picked up the tea and sipped some.
"Mom!" Lisa yelled coming downstairs holding her eye. "Bart squrted 
dad's colougin in my eye!"
"Did not!" Bart said coming downstairs. "She threw pepper in my eye." 
Bart was also covering his eye.
"Did not!" Lisa said pushing Bart
"Did to!" Bart said pushing Lisa.
"Did not!"
"Did too!"
Marge slammed her book on the table.
"Both of you go outside and fight."
Lisa and Bart ran outside after seeing the anger in Marge's eyes. Marge 
sighed and picked her book back up.
"I'm so sorry about my family." Marge told Ayeka.
"Oh no! It's ok we go through this everyday." Ayeka said
"Hey Ayeka! Keep your crap on your side of the room!" Ryoko said.
"Shut up!" Homer said from the other room. "I'm trying to hear Lenny on 
the Walkie-Talkie!"
"Get them yourself!" Ayeka yelled
Then all of a sudden a huge exposene came from the basement and caused 
the house to shake.
"What's going on!?" Marge asked holding onto the couch.
"I dunno." Ayeka said.
Suddenly another expolsion which made the house tip on the right.
"Ah! Marge!" Homer said hanning by his foot off the stair banester. Lisa 
and Bart ran into the house. 
"What's going on?" Lisa said.
Then the house tipped once again and everything went back to normal and 
Homer broke the banester and his leg.
Sasami ran from downstairs
"What's going on?"
Then the front door busted open and an ugly man walked into the house.
"Where Is B. Simpson!?"
Everyone gasped.
"It's Sideshow Bob!" Lisa said
Sideshow Bob stepped into the house.
"Yes! It's me little Lisa and I've come for little Bart."
Bart ran behind Ryoko.
"Hey leave the kid alone you overgrowed mop!" Ryoko said floating in the 
air.
"He's a killer!" Bart said from behind the couch.
Homer stood up and saw sideshow Bob.
"Hey! What are you doing here!" Homer said. "I thought you were dead!"
Sideshow Bob pulled out a gun and had Washu tied up and tape over her 
mouth.
"Step back because this is no ordenary gun." He said stepping even 
closer to Ryoko and Bart.
Sideshow Bob took off the tape of Washu.
"Don't move!" She said breathing hard. "That gun can kill you in an 
instant Ryoko!"
Ryoko smerked and flew at Sideshow Bob and then she was gonna thow a 
powerball at him when he shoot the gun as everyone ducked. Sasami was 
about to be crushed by a big piece of cement when Bart pushed her out of 
the way in time having the cement piece crash to the floor. Lisa was 
holding Maggie with Ayeka and Washu. Marge and Homer was under the 
staircase. As the dust cleared. Everyone gasped at the site.

Part 1

summary: Last time we left the group when Sideshow Bob and Ryoko was 
fighting. Now we find out who was hit. Let's take a look!





Once again I don't own any of these Charators




 As the dust cleared everyone gasped at the site.
"Ryoko!" Bart said.
There lies Ryoko on the ground shot by Sideshow Bob.
"Ah hahahahahaha!" Sideshow Bob said holding the gun in trumph.
Sideshow Bob took a step closer to Bart.
"Now Bart. Come with me."
Tenchi was walking home from school and saw the house messed up and ran 
toward the house.
Sasami walked right in front of Bart.
"Leave him alone you big bully." Sasami said
"Get out of my way you ugly brat!" Sideshow Bob said pushing Sasami away 
from Bart and grabbing Bart under his arms. Bart started to squrm and 
wiggle but Sideshow Bob's grip was too strong.
"Don't try to get lose Bart." Sideshow Bob said. 
Then Tenchi caught Sideshow Bob.
"Don't move and put the boy down." Tench said blocking his path.
Sideshow Bob pulled out a gun and shot Tenchi.
"AAAAHHHH!" Tenchi screamed and fell to the ground.
"LORD TENCHI!" Ayeka screamed.
It was close cause Tenchi was shot in the leg but he didn't move cause 
Sideshow Bob would have finshed him off.
"Ta ta!" Sideshow Bob said saluting with an evil smirk.
"Let Me Go!" Bart yelled kicking Sideshow Bob.
"Someone help he's kiddnapping my son!" Marge said standing up, but it 
was too late cause Sideshow Bob has taken Bart and thrown him in his car 
and speed off.
"Bart!" Lisa yelled running after the car and also coughing of all the 
dust. Lisa could see Bart's scared and frightened face.
Kiyone ran from downstairs and saw the whole thing. She ran outside and 
started shooting at the car.
"Stop!" Kiyone yelled and the car disappered.
Kiyone droped the gun
"Damn!"
Tenchi stood up and saw where the car was going.
Ayeka ran to Tenchi to see if he was ok.
"I'm fine." Tenchi said.
Washu ran outside and threw a divice at Sideshow Bob's car and hit it.
"What was that Washu?" Lisa said
"That was a tracking device. We should be able to track down
Sideshow Bob." Washu said. She pulled out a tracking device and it    
beeping. There was a little red dot.
"We have to hurry!" Lisa said.
"Let's go kick some Sideshow Bob Ass!" Homer said standing in front of 
Washu and Lisa who was totaly spaced out.
"How are we gonna catch Sideshow Bob?" Sasami said.
"I have an idea!" Lisa said.
Ryoko suddenly stood up with a huge hole in her arm and it healed.
"I hope your plan is good Lisa." 
"It is." Lisa said with a satisfied look.
"First we all need to get ready. We can't go chase him in our PJ and we 
need to hurry."
Everyone ran it the house to get ready for their pursuit.
***********************************************************
"Well Bart it seems that I have triuphed once again." Sideshow Bob said. 
"It seems that what Krusty said was nothing but a cheap joke so I shal 
kill you and then I will kill Krusty!"
Bart was in the backseat tied up by the seatbelt.
"I thought you were dead!" Bart said squrming. "The cheif said you were 
exicuted!"
Sideshow Bob laughed out loud.
"That big tub of lard is nothing but a joke." He said twerling his gun. 
"He says a lot of things." 
"What are you gonna do to me?" he asked with his pocket knife he had in 
his hand trying to cut the seatbelt.
"Well first I'm gonna torcher you buy biting off your fingers one by 
one." he said with his eyes on the road.
Bart was still trying to cut the seatbelt and he was half way through.
"Then I'm gonna shoot you in your head and hang you then stuff you and 
eat you for Thanksgiving dinner!!!!!!!!"
"Not if I can help it!" Bart said. He leaped from the seat and kicked 
Sideshow Bob in the face.
"Ah! Why you little brat!" Sideshow Bob grabed the Ax in the pasanger 
seat and tried to chop Bart in half.
"Ah!" Bart said dodgeing Bob's attacks.
"Let me kill you!" Bob was really angry now. 
Bart then ran to the side door and tried to open it. The car then jerked 
because no one was driving the car. Bart was thrown to the other side of 
the car and Sideshow Bob caught Bart by his leg and pulled him to the 
passager seat as Bob raised the the ax and slung it down but Bart 
crawled to the floor as Bob sliced the door then Bart tried to make a 
clean get away but the car jerked to the left as Bart was trown from the 
car and was about to go over the cliff but Bob caught him and pulled him 
back in the car as the car tubbled on its side and rolled as Sideshow 
Bob and Bart was trown all around the car and the car hit a tree and Bob 
was ejected through the window as Bart just hit the seat.
Bart rubbed his head and his butt.
"Whoa! That was so cool!" he said he crawled out of car throgh the top 
of the car.
"Hey Bob! Nice try but it's not gonna work." Bart said
Bart was headded toward the Okayama police department but Sideshow Bob 
grabbed Bart and ran toward the forest.
"Hey! Let go you lost!" Bart said trying to pry Bob's hand off of him 
then he noticed there was blood on his hand. Bart gasped and looked at 
Bob's face and it had all kind of scars and loads of blood. Bart 
despratly tried to get lose. As Sideshow Bob dissapered in the forest.
"Help!!!! Someone Help!" Bart yelled.
Sideshow Bob put his hand on Bart's mouth with his scars and bruses all 
over his hand.
*********************************************************

"Is everyone ready?" Lisa said.
Washu came running from the lab.
"Lisa! It seems that Sideshow Bob's car has crashed by a nearby 
slaughter house!"
"Oh No!" Marge said
"We have to hurry!" Homer said. "There isn't much time to lose. We must 
sacrafice our time to save someones life."
Everyone looked at Homer like he was crazy.
"I can be dramatic too!" Homer said
Everyone went outside. Ryoko grabbed Ryoohki and threw her in the air 
and she transfored into the huge ship she was. Then everyone was 
teleported in the ship and went straght to the location of the car.
"Wow! This tecnology is mighty advanced." Lisa said. "Who knew that a 
mear animal could turn into a ship."
Ryoohki had tracked the site of the crash.
"Ok everyone we need to spilt up and search for Sideshow Bob." Marge 
said. "He seemed very serious."
Everyone split up to look for Sideshow Bob.
Mihoshi and Kiyone went together with Sasami.
Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi went togther.
Homer and Marge went together.
Washu and Lisa had a tracker to track Bart's presents.
"Bart!" Marge yelled.
"Boy! Where are you boy!" Homer yelled.
Meanwhile Tenchi and Ryoko and Ayeka were looking for clues.
"I don't see any parts of Bart anywhere." Tenchi said
"We have to keep looking." Ryoko said
Then a sudden yell came from Mihoshi and Kiyone's patrol area.
Everyone rushed to see what it was.
"Oh my God!" Marge said in shock. There on a lonely tree was blood 
smered all over it.
Near by there were tracks that could possible be Bart's.
"Do you think Bart is still alive?" Mihoshi said.
"I think Bart is just fine." Ryoko said.
"Huh?" Everyone said in gasp.
Marge then shook her head yes.
"My Bart has surivied through Sideshow Bob's threts and plans to kill 
him."
Lisa and Homer shook their heads. 
(Maggie is at home with Tenchi's dad and grandpa.)
The Simpsons and the Tenchi gang ran to follow the tracks.
*********************************************************
Bart was still trying to get free from Sideshow Bob.
"Oh little Bart Simpson. I can't wait to kill you. I've been waiting for 
a long time for this moment." Sideshow Bob's grip was getting stronger. 
Bart started to get sleepy and tried his hardest to stay awake but 
failed and fell asleep.
"This just makes it a lot easyier on me." Bob said. "Just a few more 
steps to the slaughter house and all my problems will go away. Of corse 
I would have to kill all of Bart's friends and family to stop everyone 
from getting in my way. Lisa will be the first to go."
Bart was just helpless and fast asleep.
Sideshow Bob grew ever closer to the slaughter house.
He climbed over the barbed wire and to the abandoned slaughter house. 
Finnaly Bart's Family and the Tenchi gang made it.
"Finaly! If I solve this case I will get a wonderus promotion!" Kiyone 
said.
"There he is!" Mihoshi said
"Freeze!" Kiyone said with her gun
"Bart! Try to get away!" Sasami said.
Sideshow Bob grabbed a gun from his pocket and aimed it at everyone and 
opened fire.
"Ah! Everyone take cover!" Tenchi said
Everyone ducked behind the bushes.
"Stop you crazy maniac!" Washu yelled.
Kiyone sat up from behind the bush and fired at Sideshow Bob.
Then Sideshow Bob fired at Kiyone and shot the gun out of her hand.
"Ah!" Kiyone yelled and held her hand as blood dripped from it.
"Kiyone! Oh dear are you ok?" Marge said putting her hankerchife on her 
hand. 
Bob's firing lasted till he ran out of builts. Then he jumped over the 
barbed wire and ran to the barn.
Ryoko flew from the bush and hovered above Sideshow Bob throwing her 
powerballs at him.
The powerball threw him across the pasture with Bart in his arm. It was 
suprising how he could sleep through all of that. Then Sideshow Bob shot 
a gun at Ryoko and hit her in the leg.
"AHH!" Ryoko screamed and feel to the ground. Mihoshi ran out the bush 
and shot at Sideshow Bob but she missed the last one when Sideshow Bob 
ran into the barn. 
"We have to hurry! There's no time to lose!" Homer said as they all ran 
into the barn. When they went in Bart was tied to a chair and Sideshow 
Bob had a gun and an ax in his hand.
"Keep Back!" He said. He was all shaky and his eyes was red and he was 
bloody and scared.
"Don't move!" He yelled. "I'll shoot! I mean it! This is my time to 
shine! It's my turn to make your lives missrible! I've been in a jail 
cell for years and now I can kill Bart Simpson!"
Lisa took a step forward.
"DON'T MOVE! I SAID DON'T MOVE!" Sideshow Bob said pointing his gun at 
Lisa.
Bart was still asleep.
"Good-Bye Bart Simpson!" Sideshow Bob said. He lifted up the ax but 
Homer jumped in the way and pushed the chair out of the way as Homer 
came so close to having his eggrole cut off.
"Ah!" Homer said. Homer grabbed the ax out of Sideshow Bob's hand and 
threw it out the window.
Sideshow Bob was really angry! His eyes were now blood red and he 
pointed the gun at Lisa and pulled the trigger shooting the built.
Bart jumped in the way and got hit.
"Bart!" Lisa yelled falling to her knees as he lied there. Tears started 
forming from her eyes. Then Bart began to move. Lisa gasped and hugged 
Bart.
"Oh Bart! Your alive." Lisa yelled. "I'm not the only child!"
"What about Maggie?" Homer said
"Oh yeah!" I won't be the only child who can talk. Icthy and Scatchy 
won't be the same without another kid laughing with me!"
Bart was holding his arm where the built was.
"Oh Lisa." He said wearaly. "I'd miss you too but now I have to take a 
nap." Then he clopsed on the ground.
"NO! I WAS SO CLOSE!" Sideshow Bob said. Mihoshi pulled her gun out on 
Sideshow Bob.
"Yeah right! Your under arrest for attepted murder." Mihoshi put the 
cuffs on Sideshow Bob and took him to the Okayama police department.
Bart was taken to Washu's lab to get the bulit removed.
"OW!" Bart yelled
"Ah, stop being a baby." Washu said sticking the twezer back into Bart.
"OW" Bart yelled. Washu finaly got the built out and gave it to Bart.
"Your welcome. Now go, I have work to do." Washu said pointing to the 
exit.
Bart mutterd something and left he lab.
He was then greeted by Sasami.
"Oh Bart that was the most heroic thing I've ever seen anyone do." 
Sasami gave Bart a big kiss on the lips and went into the kitchen to 
cook.
Tenchi and Homer was the only ones in the living room who saw Sasami 
kiss Bart.
"OOOHHHH!" Homer said
"I hear weding bells." Tenchi said
"Get bent!" Bart said and went into the kitchen with Sasami.
Homer and Tenchi looked at each other and bursted out laughing.
"So, what are you gonna do with a house full of single women?" Homer 
said.
Tenchi put his hand behind his head. 
"I'm not exsactly that kind of person." 
"Sure you aren't." Homer said and started laughing.
"Really what are you gonna do?" He said with a serious face.
