It's been a while since I last posted this so I hope
there are still people out there who still remember
it. ^^; Anyway, this is based after the S season of
Sailor Moon. Haruka and Michiru do appear in this ep.
and they do have an excuse for having been absent so
far in the series. Well, I am currently working on ep.
7 and I'll try to get it finished soon. Bye!

Sakuya-sama ^_^ no Jurai

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Juraihelm
Episode 6

"I’m home!" Sasami announces as she closes the front
door behind. "What an embarrassing day....," she
sighs, kicking her shoes off.
"I told you that you shouldn’t try the Pretty
Teleport!" Ryo-ohki scolds, perched on Sasami’s
shoulder.
"Hi, sweetheart!" her mom calls from the kitchen,
"Dinner’s almost ready.
"Hi, papa!" she says throwing her arms around her dad
who is sitting on the couch reading the paper.
"Hello, Sasami-chan," Ginji turns to face his
daughter. "Ryo-ohki?!" he exclaims, his eyes light up
at the sight of the cabbit sitting on his daughter’s
shoulder. "Honoka! Come quick!"
"What is it?" Mrs. Kawai asks running from the
kitchen. "Ryo-ohki is back!" she smiles.
"How have you been?" Ginji asks.
"Miyaaa....," Ryo-ohki replies.
"What’s the matter, Ryo-ohki?" Honoka asks with a
worried look on her face, "Can’t you talk? Do you have
laryngitis? Have you lost your voice?"
"Uh... Well...," the cabbit laughs nervously, "I-I
didn’t realize you knew I could...."
"Is that all? Oh, thank goodness!" Honoka says with
relief, "You scared me for a minute."
"Wait!" Mr. Kawai says, "If Ryo-ohki is back, that
must mean...."
Sasami’s parents stare at their daughter intently.
"Yes, Pretty Sammy is back, too...," Sasami sighs.
Her parents begin to cheer and dance.
"Just in time, too!" Honoka says.
"The store is saved!" Ginji says.
"What do you mean ‘the store is saved’?" Sasami asks.
"Well, Sasami-chan,... sales at the store haven’t been
very great lately and we were hoping that Pretty Sammy
could.... well... Here. Look at this...," she hands
Sasami what appears to be a flier.
"A concert?!" Sasami exclaims after running her eyes
over it, "You already have fliers.....?"
"The last concert did so well. We’re in the red again.
Pretty Sammy, we need your help." Sasami’s dad stares
at her with puppy dog eyes.
"How long have you guys been planning this?"
"If not, we’ll be forced out on the streets...," her
mother continues with the melodrama, her eyes
glistening with tears, "... penniless... no place to
live...."
"So sad!" they hold each other and sob together.
"I can’t possibly say no to them when they’re this
pathetic....," she thinks. "All right...," she sighs,
"I’ll do it..."
"Really?" their faces light up.
Sasami nods unenthusiastically.
"Thank you Pretty Sammy!"
"We knew we could depend on you!"
Sasami manages a smile as her parents kiss her on the
cheek.
"What have I gotten myself into....?" Sasami thinks.

        "Ouch!" Usagi yelps as a book is smacked down upon
her head.
        "What do you think you’re doing, daydreaming?" Rei
says, "We’re supposed to be studying!"
        Mamoru has taken Chibiusa home, leaving the girls at
Rei’s place for their normal study group.
        "It’s hard for me to concentrate after what happened
this afternoon!" Usagi says in her defense, rubbing
the back of her head.
        "What’s your excuse for every other day?" Makoto
asks.
        "It was a rather strange experience and most
certainly worth looking into...," Ami says.
        The girls’ stares gather on Ami.
 "After we finish studying, of course," she adds.
        The girls face fault.
        "Do you think this ‘Pretty Sammy’ or whatever is on
our side?" Minako asks.
        "More than likely, but it’s always good to be
cautious," Ami says.
        "I don’t know...," Makoto says, "That girl with her
didn’t look too friendly..."
        There is a knock on the door of Rei’s room that leads
to the outside.
        Rei rises and slides the screen door open.
        "Haruka-san, Michiru-san!"
        "Sorry to interrupt you like this," Haruka
apologizes.
        "Your grandfather told us you were here," Michiru
says.
"It’s no problem. Won’t you please come in?" Rei
invites them, "Pardon the mess, but we were in the
middle of a study session."
"Ow!" There’s a sound as Rei closes the door.
She reopens it to find Luna and Artemis, who is
rubbing his sore nose.
"Such a klutz...," Luna shakes her head.
"Didn’t you see us standing there next to them?!"
Artemis snaps.
"Sorry...." Rei says closing the door behind them.
"We apologize for not being there to help you this
afternoon, but Michiru and I were out of town. Michiru
had a violin recital," Haruka explains.
"Luna and Artemis gave us all the details of our
mission," Michiru says, "I know it’s a bit early, but
have you had any luck yet?"
"Not a thing...," Makoto says.
"I just received this today," Luna says. A henshin
wand appears in the air and floats gently to the
floor.
The girls take hold of the wand and pass it around the
room.
"It’s so beautiful....," Minako says, passing it to
Rei.
Rei pulls hers out and compares the two. The colors of
the Juraihelm henshin wand are iridescent. The handle
looks like it was shaped from a giant pearl. On the
top there is a pale pink heart surround by what looks
like pastel green leaves. There is a light yellow star
in the middle with the symbol for the planet in the
center, an upside-down triangle with a line down the
middle.
"It took a while to find. It hasn’t been used in a
long time, but it still has just as much energy as it
used to. This should lead us to the princess of
Juraihelm."
"How’s that?"
"It should react to her magical force...," Artemis
says, "Her ‘ki’, if you will..."
"How will it react?"
"We don’t know, but if we come in contact with her we
should know," Luna says.

        "Aah! That was great!" His stomach full, Ryo-ohki
flops onto Sasami’s bed. "I’m stuffed! I  think I’ll
turn in now...," he yawns, curling up on one of
Sasami’s carrot pillows and closing his eyes.
"Oyasumi..."
        "Oh no you don’t!" Sasami says closing the bedroom
door behind her.
        "Eh? Nani?" he lifts an ear and peers at her through
one eye.
        "Don’t think I’m going to let you off that easy!"
        "Wh-what do you mean?"
        "I have some things I’d like to discuss with you...,"
Sasami glares down at the cabbit, her battle aura
almost visible.
        Ryo-ohki gulps.
        "I’ve written to you, I’ve called you on the special
phone that Queen Tsunami gave me, I left messages, I
even e-mailed you....!" she lists on her fingers, "Why
is it that I never heard anything from you? Not one
thing since you left!"
        "I-I got busy...?" Ryo-ohki says with no confidence
that Sasami will buy his excuse.
        "PA-THE-TIC!!!" she scolds, "You could’ve at least
come up with something better like... like... I don’t
know!!"
        "I’m really sorry..."
        "Hmph! Typical male...," Sasami huffs, crossing her
arms and flipping her nose in the air, "Never return
my calls, lie to me... and we _pinky swore_, too!!"
        "I know... I’m sorry..."
        Sasami gives no reply.
        Ryo-ohki makes the most pitiful eyes he can.
        Sasami glances at him. The stare has broken down all
her defenses, but she does not want to show it.
        "It’s okay... I guess..., " she says. "Just don’t do
it ever again! Do you know what torture it is for a
girl to wait like that?!" she says through clinched
teeth.
        "I promise! I’ll never do that again! I’ll return
your phone calls and everything.... Pinky swear....?"
