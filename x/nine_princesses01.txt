Hi!  Okay, before I start anything, I have to tell you all that Sailor 
Moon does not belong to Kodansha!  I'm not sure who it belongs to, but 
not them, or me for that matter.  And, I wrote this a couple months ago 
and haven't posted it just cuz I'm lazy!  Bad SoJ!  Bad, Bad SoJ!
-The SoJ
P.S.  And, I don't own Tenchi Muyo either.  Who knew?

	"'Tis a far, far better thing that I do now, than I have ever 
done before.  'Tis a far, far better rest that I go to now, than I have 
ever known," read Lita.  Amy and Mina clapped.
	"That was really good Lita!  And it was really nice of you to 
read it for Serena who wasn't even listening!" said Mina.  The others 
laughed and looked at their ditzy blonde friend.  She was reading a 
Sailor V comic book.  Amy tapped her shoulder.
	"Huh?  What?" Serena said, coming out of her trance.  The others 
laughed again.  Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.  Lita opened 
it.
	"Hi Darien!" she said.
	"Hey, is my Princess here?" he smiled.
	"Yes!  Yes!  I'm here!" Serena cried.  She jumped into Darien's 
arms and kissed him.  "I'll see you guys later!  We're going out for 
dinner tonight.  Ta-ta!"  Serena and Darien walked out the door.  The 
rest of the girls just stared.
	"Hey, Raye?  What's up?  You've been too quiet recently," asked 
Amy.  But Raye didn't answer.  She was kneeling on the floor staring 
into space.  She was having a vision.  No one knew it at that moment, 
but far away, in a rural area of Japan, a certain black-haired, brown-
eyed boy was having the same vision.

	Tenchi was in some sort of spaceship-palace thing.  He knew he 
had to find Aeka, Ryoko, and Washu.  He noticed a girl a few years 
younger that him on the floor.  She appeared to be in a deep sleep.  
She was also very pretty.  Tenchi knelt to her.
	"Stop!" cried a voice.
Seven girls rushed up behind him.  A tall, aqua-haired one said, 
"Get away from her!"
"I was just-" Tenchi started but then a man and woman appeared.  
He recognized the man as Kagato, but the woman was unfamiliar.  The 
woman pulled out a dagger made out of black crystal.  Tenchi found he 
couldn't move.  The woman moved toward him, then he felt an intense 
pain in his chest.  The woman and Kagato started laughing.
Tenchi blinked.
He wasn't on the strange spaceship.  He was in the garden, 
harvesting carrots for Ryo-Ohki.  But the vision was scary.  Tenchi 
shook the feeling off.  Kagato was dead, and he'd never seen the girls 
in his vision before.  Tenchi went back to work, but to him it seemed a 
little colder.

	Raye opened her eyes.  She was lying on her bed, and her friends 
and Darien were sitting next to her.
	"Raye!  Thank goodness!  We thought you had a concussion or 
something," Serena cried. "You don't, do you?"
	"No.  I was having a strange vision.  I guess it just took 
everything out of me," Raye murmured.  She described the strange 
spaceship and the boy.
	"That's really weird, Raye, because I just had a dream like 
that," said Amy.  
	"Hey, me too!" exclaimed Mina.  As it turned out, all of the 
Sailor Scouts had had the odd dream.  It was always the same, with Raye 
laying on the floor, and the strange, dark-eyed boy, and the man and 
woman who were laughing hysterically.  All of a sudden, Lita's 
communicator started bleeping.  It was Luna.
	"Scouts, major discovery!  Meet the Outer Planet Scouts in the 
park," she reported, and her voice fizzled out.
	"Let's go guys!" shouted Serena.  Raye got out of bed, and 
swayed.  Darien caught her.
	"Are you sure you're up to this Raye?  Maybe you should stay in 
bed," he suggested.
	"No, I'm fine thanks," replied Raye.  Darien shrugged and the two 
of them walked out of the temple.

	At the park, everyone transformed.   "Now, let's get down to 
business," said Luna.  "As it seems, when we defeated the Negamoon 
family, there was one member who escaped.  It was a woman, the half-
sister of Prince Diamond.  Her name is Lady Obsidia.  Now, it seems she 
has raised the ghost of a very powerful man who tried to destroy earth.  
We do not know who he is, just that he is the cousin of lady Obsidia."
	"We found out more by ourselves," explained Haruka.  "It seems 
that they are going to destroy the world, but first they want to attack 
a location in the mountains of Japan."
	"Why?" asked Serena.
	"We're not sure why, but we do know that they want to kill 
someone, although we don't know who," said Michiru.
	"So, what are we going to do?" asked Mina.
	"You will have to go to the mountains, find the person they want 
to kill, and defeat Lady Obsidia and her accomplice," instructed 
Artemis.
	"When do we leave?" asked Darien.  Luna gulped and jumped into 
his lap.
	"Darien, I'm sorry, but you will have to stay in Tokyo.  The 
scouts need to stay as inconspicuous as possible, and that means that 
only they can go," she said softly.
	"No!" screamed Serena and clung to Darien tightly.
	"Serena, you know Luna's right.  I have to stay here.  But a day 
won't go by that I won't think of you," Darien kissed her.  Serena 
gulped.
	"You scouts go home and tell your parents that you'll be gone for 
a few weeks.   Setsuna, tell Rini and Hotaru.  And Serena, I truly am 
sorry.  Not even we can go," said Artemis.  Darien's eyes hardened.
	"No.  If I can't go to protect Serena, you, Artemis, and Diana 
will have to," he said.   He kissed Serena again and held her in his 
arms.  Raye watched, then turned and headed for home, wishing with all 
her heart that someone would hold her like that too.
