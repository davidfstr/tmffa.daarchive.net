Aloha!  Well, here's some more.  I know that first chapter was really 
short and had almost nothing to do with Tenchi, but oh well.  This one 
does.  Is everyone happy now?  And I do not own Sailor Moon or Tenchi 
Muyo. (thought you could catch me there, couldn't ya?)

	Tenchi sat down in his math class.  He noticed there was a new 
teacher.  She had long, green hair and violet eyes.  She wrote her 
name, Miss Setsuna, on the board.  
	"Hello class.  In case you don't know how to read, I am Miss 
Setsuna.  I will be your math teacher for the rest of the semester.  I 
am not the only new face.  Please say hello to Amy Mizuno.  She is 
taking this class as an advanced tenth grade course," she announced and 
pointed to Amy, a quiet looking girl with short hair and deep blue 
eyes.
	"Hello," she greeted.  She had a high, friendly voice.  She took 
a seat next to Tenchi.
	"Now, please open your books to page 346," Miss Setsuna 
instructed.

	Tenchi sat down at on a bench at lunch.  It had been a weird 
morning.  After math he had gym and art, both taught by new teachers.  
The gym teacher looked like a guy, but surprised everyone by 
introducing herself as Miss Haruka.  After she instructed them to run 
one mile, she offered that anyone who could beat her in a footrace 
would get 200 points of extra credit.  Tenchi watched in amazement as 
the fleet-footed young woman left the fastest runners in the dust.  But 
Miss Haruka was nothing compared to Miss Michiru, the art teacher.
	She was beautiful, but also seemed cold.  After she gave the art 
project, she stared directly at Tenchi.  She struck fear into his 
heart, and yet seemed awfully familiar.  But Tenchi just shrugged it 
off.
	He looked around for his friends.  They weren't anywhere in 
sight.  He slowly got up to go study in the library, when someone 
bumped into him.  It was Amy Mizuno, the girl from math class.
	"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry!" she apologized, helping him up.  "Are 
you okay?"
	"Yeah I'm fine.  You're Amy, right?  My name is Tenchi Masaki, " 
he said.  Amy nodded.
	"Me and my friends just moved here from Tokyo," she explained.
	"Where are they?" Tenchi questioned.  She pointed to four girls 
in a corner.  They, like the teachers, looked strangely familiar. 
Especially the girl with long, raven-colored hair.
	"Come on, I'll introduce you," Amy offered.  Tenchi followed her 
over to the group of girls.  "Guys, this is Tenchi.  Tenchi, this is 
Lita Kino and Mina Aino," she motioned to a girl with long blonde hair 
and a red ribbon.  She smiled.  The other, a very tall brunette offered 
her hand in greeting.
	Well, they're definitely friendly Tenchi thought.  He looked at 
the other two girls.  One had blonde hair even longer than Mina's, and 
it was tied into two long pigtails.  She appeared to by crying.
	"H-hi.  My name is S-s-Serena Tsu-" she broke off into a sob.  
The last girl, the one with the raven colored hair patted her shoulder.
	"Serena is really upset because her boyfriend's still in Tokyo.  
By the way, my name's Raye Hino," she replied.  Tenchi looked at the 
five girls.  The seemed nice and normal, but he had a feeling there was 
more to them.  Well, they're just girls.  How dangerous can they be? he 
thought.  But then he was reminded of the powerful, beautiful, slightly 
insane women at his house.
	"It was nice meeting you all, but I've got to go now.  See you 
around!" he called, halfway to the door.  Sure, Amy, Mina, Lita, 
Serena, and Raye were okay.  He even thought Raye was kind of pretty.  
But he had learned not to trust women too much until you knew them.  
Tenchi knew that better than anyone.
