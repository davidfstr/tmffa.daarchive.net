*Another* Family Member? Prlouge
By Vise

Ryooko and Vise meet. What nightmarish torture will the Muyo residents
suffer?

Vise slowly creeped through the woods towards her prey, a girl with light
blue hair, sitting in a tree. She was holding something. Vise creeped nearer
and saw she was holding a picture of a boy. Vise pulled out her sword and
pointed it to the girl's neck.
Vise: Prepare to die.
Ryooko vanished. She reappeared behind Vise, a sword in her hand.
Ryooko: Well, well, well, who do we have here? A spy? A galaxy police
officer? What?
Vise turned around to face her.
Vise: I'm a hunter.
Ryooko: Oh, a bounty hunter!
Vise: I'm insulted! I hunt for food! I have enough money! Bounty hunters are
weaklings, an insult to hunters! I got half my money stealing, not hunting
other people! I do that for free! I have some honor, you know!
Ryooko looked at the girl with light green hair and dark green eyes. She was
actually very similar to Ryooko in many ways.
Ryooko: Come on, kid.
Vise: I just happen to be several millions of years old, thank you, little
one!
Ryooko: Little one? I've been alive about as long as you have!
Vise: I'm here to look for my second cousin Ryooko. Why are you here?
Ryooko: I live here! And my name is Ryooko!
