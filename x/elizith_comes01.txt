Elizith Comes:Search for the Lugia  Part one

A Yugi look-alike comes to Tenchi's house, with her Pokemon.

Disclaimer:I do not own any of these characters (Except for Elizith) they
either belong to pioneer and AIC or Nintendo(I am NOT making any money off
of
them so DON'T SUE ME!!!!!!)

Sasami woke up to a regular day (as usual) She got on her clothes, went down
stairs, but before she could even make breakfast, she heard a loud crashing
noise outside.
"What the hell was that?!?!?!" Ryoko replied as she came
downstairs.(Followed
by the rest of the Tenchi crew)
"I don't know" Sasami said, "lets go see."
Everyone walked outside and saw a spaceship that had crashed in the lake.
"Why did you do that Hinnasei?!?!?" said a voice that sounded alot like
Yugi.
"I didn't do anything!" another voice said, "the spaceship just crashed!"
"I can see that." said the Yugi voice.
Tenchi and everyone else had to cover their ears though when....
"GO POKEBALL!!!"
"What's a pokeball?" asked Mihoshi, who was clueless as ever.
A big dog carrying the two talkers swam twoards the shore of the beach.
"Yugi?" Sasmi said in shock.
" I'm not her, but I know who you're talking about" the girl said, "My name
is Elizith, and with my talking pokemon, I sware I shall capture Yugi and
complete my collection!"
The big dog raced up to the Misaki Shrine
"No! Yugi" Sasami cried as she began to give chase

To be continued

Next part:Elizith thought Yugi was acually a Lugia, and admits she's sorry,
but for just coming out of the blue, can our hero and heroines trust her?
(Bonus for all you Yugi fans:She wakes up!)
