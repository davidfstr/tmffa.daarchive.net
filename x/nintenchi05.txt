Last time on Nintenchi!
Sakuya seemed to have lost her powers, which provided a perfect opportunity for 
the Illusionator to strike. Sakuya awakened Yugi to battle her rogue cre   
ation, and after the battle, Sakuya merged with her creator, and reclaimed her 
powers. Let's head back to Nintendia!

Episode 4
Mushroom Muyo!
(or: No Need for Plumbers)


Chapter 1 
Super Sakuya 64
(or: No Need for a Pipe)

(The Mushroom Kingdom)

We were back in Nintendia, and we were in the Mushroom Kingdom. Tenchi was 
humming the Mario theme song as we headed towards the castle. "Wow, it's 
beautiful!" said Sasami. We went in. "Oh, hello!" The upstairs doors opened, and 
out came Princess Toadstool, aka Peach. "Hi, Peach." I said. "Things have 
certainly been peaceful since... YAAAAAHHHH!" There was a loud crash! Suddenly, 
Bowser jumped down out of the sky, grabbed Peach, and pulled her out the door. 
"We have to stop him!" I     said. "Right." said Sakuya. "ILLUSION...
SUPER...
FIRE..." "No! Sakuya! You'll just cause even more damage!" cried Tenchi.
"You're right, Tenchi, let's get outside." said Sakuya.
When we got out, Bowser was nowhere to be seen. "Darn it!" said Sakuya.
"Now where could they have gone?" I said. Suddenly, a horde of Goombas rained 
down on us. "GOOMBA HORDE!" I shouted. One of the Goombas landed straight on my 
head. Everything went black...
ouch.

Chapter 2:
Imprisoned!
(or: No Need for a Cell)
(no, not that one)

(BGN HQ)
When I awoke, we were all in a little tiny cell.
"ILLUSION...
POKE...
BALL...
CREATION! Go, Onix!"
Sakuya's Poke Ball got midway through opening, then suddenly closed again.
"Great. They obviously planned for this. How are we going to get out?" said 
Sakuya, seeing the plan not work.
"Uh, over here, people, I can pass through walls, see?" said Ryoko. She tried to 
get out through the wall. "OUCH! That's not possible! Nothing can hold me! How 
could they have figured out that I could do that???" sho    uted Ryoko. "YOU'LL 
PAY FOR THIS, BOWSER! BUTCH! CASSIDY! GANONDORF! AND ALL YOU OTHERS! I'LL KILL 
YOU ALL!"
"Um, Ryoko, if you kill them all, there will be no point in having any more fan 
fictions. You'll be out of a job until they finish the next series..." I said. 
"I could use a break! It'll give me more time to be with Tenchi!!!" answered 
Ryoko, sitting next to Tenchi. "Will you be quiet, Ryoko, I'm trying to think of 
a way to get out of here!" he said. "Wait. Hmm, could I use... but I haven't 
done it in so long... and I don't even know if I can do it. Oh well, here 
goes..." Tenchi concentrated. And he concentrated. He was about to give up when 
he said, "Duh! The gems!" Everyone gave Tenchi their gems. Tenchi generated the 
sword, then he concentrated some more. There was a great flash of light, and...
The Lighthawk Wings appeared.
"The... the Lighthawk Wings! But, Tenchi, you couldn't use those in Tenchi in 
Tokyo!" said Ayeka. "Who said I couldn't? I just never bothered! Although I did 
have doubts, given     that Tenchi Universe didn't have them either." said 
Tenchi. Tenchi used the extra power of the Lighthawk Wings to bend open the 
bars. "Everybody out! Let's go find Peach!" I said. We all rushed out of the 
cell. Suddenly, Koopa Troopas stormed towards us. Ryoko shot energy balls at 
them. "Die, turtle thingies! Ha ha ha ha ha!" she said, laughing maniacally. 
"Let's go, Ryo-Ohki!" said Sasami. Ryo-Ohki transformed into the pink robo-
cabbit! Ryo-Ohki battled through the Koopa Troopas. So did Tenchi, and so did 
Sakuya using Illusion Poke Ball Creation. We finally reached the place where 
Peach was held. Ryoko busted open the door. "Let's go, Peach!" We ran towards 
the door, and were just about to get out when Bowser stepped out in front! "No 
Need for an Exit!!!" he said.

Chapter 3:
Sakoopa Koopashiro!
(or: No Need for a Koopa Klone)

"It's Bowser!" everyone gasped.
"Yes! And now, I have a little surprise for you. Come on in, Sakoopa!"
In came an exact replica of Sakuya, except wearing a turtle shell!
"This is Sako    opa Koopashiro, my Koopa Klone. It copies a person in exact 
detail. Plus, it gives them a turtle shell, so they have extra protection!" said 
Bowser. Sakoopa went into a fighting pose.
"OK, copy Koopa, if that's how you want to do things...
ILLUSION...
POKE...
BALL...
CREATION! Get out there, Ditto!" said Sakuya. "Ditto, Transform into Bowser!" 
Ditto did. "OK, Sakoopa! Give that kid a taste of her own medicine!" said the 
real Bowser. "You got it, your geniusship, sir!" said Sakoopa. "Hey! I'M the 
genius! Get that little copy, Sakuya!" said Washu.
"ILLUSION...
SUPER...
FIRE...
ATTACK!" cried Sakoopa. Sakoopa shot a fire sculpture just like Sakuya's at 
Sakuya.
"DITTO! BLOCK IT!" ordered Sakuya. Ditto turned its shell towards the attack. It 
didn't even get hurt.
"Great job, Ditto!" congratulated Sakuya.
"Hmm... Sakoopa, try to get that little blob that thinks it's me out of 
commission." said Bowser.
"Right." said Sakoopa, getting ready to launch another attack.
"ILLUSION...
SUPER...
FIRE...
ATTACK!"
The second at    tack hit Ditto again. But this time, it untransformed.
"DITTO!" cried Sakuya.
"Ha-ha! Now I have you!" said Sakoopa.
"ILLUSION...
FIRE...
BALL...
A..." Suddenly, Sakoopa melted!
"WHAT? How dare you destroy my precious Sakoopa! Who did this?!?!" yelled Bowser 
in a rage.
"It's-a me! WASHU!!!" said Washu. "I just used my computer to hack into 
Sakoopa's brain-backup duplicator, and overload it, causing her to melt. NOW 
who's the genius?!"
"HOORAY FOR WASHU!!!" said Sakuya.
"Now, let's finish this!" said Tenchi, confidently. He went behind Bowser, 
grabbed him by the tail, and started to spin him around. "I saw this in a video 
game once." said Tenchi. When he was spinning really quickly, he released 
Bowser. "So long-a, Bowser!" Bowser smashed through the wall.
"SAKOOPA WILL RETURN!!!!!" shouted Bowser as he fell.

Chapter 4:
Game Over
(or: No Need for... Goodbye? Already? Sheesh!)

(Peach's castle)

"Well, we've been to all three main game worlds... guess we're done." I said.
"Done?!" said Tenchi. "But we can't be    >done!"
"Looks like we are, Tenchi. We went to the Pokemon world, Hyrule, and the 
Mushroom Kingdom. We're done." said Sakuya.
"But what about everywhere else? We haven't been to Zebes, or the DK Isles, or 
even Yoshi's Island! We haven't been to Dream Land, we haven't seen a single 
Mario Kart race or Super Smash Bros. fight, and you say we're DONE? We've just 
started!" said Tenchi.
"Hmm, you have a point there, Tench. But what could..." I started to say. I was 
interrupted by a call on the NINTENDO (Nifty Invention for Neat Things that End 
Nutty Dragged-Out trips) commun   "icator. It was Link. "Tom, the BGN is 
attacking Nintendia Prime! You have to get over here quickly!"
"WHAT? OK, we'll be right there. Looks like we have an adventure!" I said. "I 
just hope Bowser was wrong, and Sakoopa isn't back..."
