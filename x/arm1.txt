It begins
Chapter 1 to Armageddon Prophecy
By: Pyrous



It was still and quiet in the Masaki residence, which is a rare occurrence
except at this time, for it was still early and not a soul was awake.  Washuu
was sleeping quite soundly in her soft bed.  No one could have predicted what
happened next.  "NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" Washuu screamed as she woke in a
cold sweat.  Washuu looked around her at the rest of the room.  Still and
quite not a rustle, not a stir came from the shadows.  "How could this be,"
She asked herself holding her forehead feeling the cold cool sweat running
down her cheek, "It seemed so convincing.  Nothing happened you took care of
that thousands of years ago.  Did I?"

_______________________________________________________________________

Later that day the sun rose over the hills and shined on the small house as
day greeted it once again.  At the breakfast table of the Masaki house every
one was sitting at the table eating what else but breakfast.  Everything was
quite for once in the millennium.  The reason is for some reason today Ryoko
was sleeping in.  As every one ate little did they know of the experience
about to unfold.  Ryoko came running down at a lightning speed in her bath
robe screaming.
"My god, you guys there is burglar in the house!" said Ryoko abnormally
frightened as she interrupted everyone's small talk.
"A Burglar!" everyone at the table said in unison.
"Yes, and he's got Mihoshi!!!" Ryoko said.
"What's up?" Mihoshi asked coming into the room with a man with oddly cut blue
hair and a scar on his face.
"What the?" Aeyka said, "Ryoko, this burglar of yours is in A GALAXY POLICE
UNIFORM!!!"
"I was groggy," Ryoko replied, "I didn't know."
"Uhhh... Mihoshi,"The visitor said to Mihoshi already sitting at the table and
eating, "weren't you going to introduce me to your friends?"
"What?  Oh... everyone this is Kale, my new partner," Mihoshi started as
Kiyone stared with a gleam in her eyes, "Kale this my old partner Kiyone, my
friends Ryoko, Aeyka and Sasami."
"Forgetting someone," Kale said pointing at Tenchi, "Or is he some passer by?"
"Oh yeah, that's Tenchi," Mihoshi said as she some what popped up with her
hands clasped and her eyes shut for a second, "He's another good friend."
"Aeyka what time is it?" Tenchi asked, "I said I would have a talk with Yousho
today and I don't want to be late."

_________________________________________________________________________

Up at the Masaki shrine

Yousho was sitting at a small table drinking tea when a shadow caught his eye.
'It was nothing, it can't be' He looks around him.  "Tenchi is that you?" he
says.
"Sorry but Tenchi's not here at the moment but please a message for your next
of kin so that they may her your last words old man!!" A voice like a vulture
booms.
Yousho looks around him for the origin of the voice.
"Nice one but I will kill him with extreme prejudice," a dragon like voice
booms.
"Who are you, show yourselves!" Yousho cries.
"Okay dokay, if you really want," a cackling voice cries, "Dark Knights reveal
your true colors!!"
Three armored figures move from the shadows into view.  One was dressed as a
vulture but in ninja style.  The second was that of a porcupine with a foil in
each hand.  The third as a dragon brandishing a long sword.   "What, not only
do you hide behind shadows but as warriors of honor?" Yousho questions, "But
I'm not afraid to fight honorable."
The Dragon steps forward. "Da names blaze, don't forget it for it is going to
be the last name you hear old man!" The dragon says. He tosses Yousho out of
the temple and to the foot of the stairs.  He signals to his partners, they in
turn destroy the shrine.

_________________________________________________________________________

A large boom emanates from the Masaki shrine and it collapse to the ground.
Tenchi and the rest look on in horror.  Tenchi looks at the rest of the house
hold, "We must go up there, Yousho might be in trouble."
"Man I really want to ruff up the guys who did this." Ryoko said.
"I don't want to lose Yousho again," Aeyka said.
"What creeps," Sasami cried.
"What happened?" Mihoshi cried.
"Desecrating a church, How vile!" Kale cried.
The group speed toward the shrine to check the damages and see if Yousho was
okay.  They made their way up the stairs to the foot of the shrine.  They
gazed in shock.
"Ah..More fuel for the fire," Blaze laughs, "My work will be slow and painful,
for you that is!!! AH HAHAHAHAHA!!!"
"What did you do to Mister Masaki!!!" Kale said cutting everyone else off.
"What does another weak old man mean to you.  He will be happy were he is,"
Quills said with a cackle to his voice.
Tenchi powers up the Tenchiken and with extreme hatred slashes at Blaze with
tears forming in his eyes.  Blaze dodges every attack with great skill and
dexterity, and thus comes back with a parry knocking Tenchi off his feet like
a trainee.
"Is that all you got boy?" Blaze laughs, "How's this for ya'.......... FLARE
OF HA..........."
Before Blaze could finish the maneuver another warrior knocks him on his back.
His armor shines with magic, and appears like a Japanese ogre.  The mask
figure wastes no time helping Tenchi up on his feet.
"Who are....." Blaze stops his question and then shouts, "Kale of Corruption,
PREPARE TO MEET THE FURY OF A DARK KNIGHT!!!!!"
If your like me your wondering; 'Why hasn't Ryoko cleaned everyone's clock by
now?'  It's because she can't.  You heard me everyone's favorite space pirate
CAN'T BEAT SOMEONE!!!! 
WAIT!!!!! I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED WHY YET!!!!
Here is the missing scene from when Tenchi ran after Blaze:
"I'LL BEAT YOU FOR WHAT YOU DID YOU STUPID FOREIGNER!!!"Ryoko screams charging
fist first at Blaze when....
"You can't do that Ryoko. Tenchi, Kale, and Yousho must fight this one alone,"
suddenly a darkhaired, young woman in a ancient Japanese monk robe appear in
front of her.
"I'm not listening to some..... say you know you remind me of a monk," Ryoko
said pleasant voice, "But Tenchi going to get.... you said Yousho and Kale?"
"Yes, I did," The woman answers.
"What good is a Galaxy Police Trainee?" Ryoko is now staring the woman
straight in the eyes.
"He wasn't always a Galaxy Police Officer, just look," The woman Points to the
field of battle at a strange armor warrior that's armor looks like a Japanese
ogre.
"What the?" Ryoko said in a puzzled way.
The mask figure wastes no time helping Tenchi up on his feet.
"Who are....." Blaze stops his question and then shouts, "Kale of Corruption,
PREPARE TO MEET THE FURY OF A DARK KNIGHT!!!!!"


.......And now your up to speed.......

"So Dark Knights' are what you curs call yourselves.  Now face the fury of the
armor of obedience!!"Kale says as he raises his sword and swings his sword to
his side pointing out all the way, "BLACK LIGHTNING STRIKE!!!"
Black bolts of lightning stream from the sword toward the opponent and clear
rubble behind them.  Pushing a side some rubble it cleared to a table which
Yousho was forced to lie under.  He got from underneath gazed at his shrine
and looked his enemy.  "You come here destroy my shrine nearly kill me, and
now, now you attack my family!!  I've never been so enraged in MY LIFE!!"
Yousho screams.
"Oh god,"Quills mutters, "ANIMALIA!"
Suddenly the man dressed in porcupine armor changed into a porcupine man in
armor.  He looks around him and laughs.  "Now show them who you really are
Dark Knights,"Quills screams, "HAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
"Shut up, I give the orders here and I order you to do what ever you can to
kill these insignificant pups," Blaze screams as he is blocking sword strikes
from Yousho.
"I got an idea....." Grayhawk sneared.  He gazed at his opponents.  He drew
his sword and scream, "Hear the cry of the heavens, feel the sting of my
starlight sword..."
"WHAT!!!!!"screamed the young woman in the monk uniform, "HE STOLE MY
TECHNIQUE, NO ONE STEALS MY TECHNIQUE!!!"
"She looks pissed," Aeyka said taking a step back and pulling Sasami away from
the young woman.
"Ryoko, you can attack now but don't stop me from massacring that little
vulture Grayhawk,"  The young woman remarked.
"Who?" Ryoko asks staring at the young woman.
"The ninja, just beat somebody okay!!!" The young woman snapped.
"Okay," Ryoko said as she and the young woman launch at the three dark
knights.  Tenchi and Kale had by this time held back quills for Ryoko to zip
in and punch him into a wall. Kale then turned his attention to Grayhawk that
had turn into a winged ninja and was out maneuvering the young woman.  He came
down with a quick slash and clipped the wing of the fling man.  The young
woman then jumped on Grayhawk and was beating him into the ground.  Everyone
at that point looked for Yousho and Blaze.
"Ma'Lady Kayura are you okay?" Kale asked the young woman.
"Yes Kale.  I don't know what made me flip like that.  I haven't done that
since the reign of the dynasty." Kayura replied.  Suddenly a roar came from
farther up the hill.
"What was that?" Tenchi shouted at the group. They all looked up the mountain
to see Yousho and Blaze in a duel, but blaze appeared as a dragon man in
armor.
"Yousho..."They all screamed.
The battle ragged on for some time.  Neither side made any attempt to
interfere. Blaze was skilled and was delivering blows with awesome skill and
speed. Yousho was blocking and parrying to the best of his ability and was on
the edge of defeat.  "I will destroy you old man.  With the blaze of the
ages........FLARE OF DRAGONS!!!!!"  Suddenly the land began to shake and the
sky turned black.  From the end of Blazes' sword came a mighty flare that
knocked Yousho off his feet.  Yousho now on the ground could do nothing, he
was completely at the mercy of this merciless creature.  "Say good bye to your
universe gramps," Blaze cackles as he points the sword down to thrust it into
the man's chest.  Suddenly a flash of blue light cut down ward on Blaze and
across his chest.  Blaze stumbled and gazed at his attacker, it was Tenchi
holding the Tenchiken with an angry look on his face.  "This can't be,  DARK
RAVEN I HAVE FAILED YOU MY LORD!!!" Blaze screamed at the top of his lungs,
"Dark Knights, Retreat.  This not the last you will see of me Emperor Tenchi,
your army will not defeat Dark Raven." And with that the  three dark knights
dis appeared into thin air.  The team survaded the damage and looked at each
other.
"What now the temple is destroyed, the rubble is every where, what can we do?"
Kale said naively.
"I could rebuild it for you in, ohh...  an hour or so," Washuu had just come
up the stairs she had been monitoring the fight from her lab, "Miss Kayura,
long time no see.  I remember your father, he helped me with Talpa five
thousand years ago."
"Yes I'll fill you in on the details later but can you repair the shrine
Goddess Washuu," Kayura asks.
"Yes and it's not Goddess Washuu it's Washuu Chan..," Washuu Corrects.

_________________________________________________________________________


Ten thousand years ago in the system of the gray star
A shogun magi known only as Dark Raven emerged
His only thought was to destroy the Universe
Only to create his own and be hailed as a god
His selfish wish would go on unfulfilled
The magi was soon chased by three goddess
In an attempt to save the universe
No one could figure out how he would do it
But they knew it required three planets
Juria; Earth; And the Planet of the gray star
In his haste the magi was corner on earth
He was then sealed by the three goddesses
To spend eternity on this primitive planet
But it was this that sparked mans rise in power
This divine intervention started the rise of a race that
Would ultimately destroy this prison some time in the future
As to stop this the goddesses spoke that
If the prison is to break five groups of heros
Would come together to stop Dark Raven 
And end the Armageddon Prophecy
Forever

"Akane wake up, it's such a beautiful day outside and you shouldn't spend it
sleeping," Kasumi yells up the stairs.
"Do I have to, can't I enjoy the day better if I'm comfortable?" Akane yells
back from her bed.
"Yes that is kind of true, but you have school pictures today," Kasumi yells
back.
"What!" Akane yelled.
"Ya, Akane and if we don't get there fast we'll be at the end of the line with
the all the greasy losers, wait that's right where you belong," Ranma shouts
up the stairs.  Suddenly a large chair comes fling down from the top of the
stairs and just misses Ranma.
"Don't they get along great they make a perfect couple," Kasumi remarks
without a hint of sarcasm.

"JAWS YOU DRUNK'IN SLOB GET UP!!!" a voice booms from a small room.  A man
dressed like an Amazon fur trapper gets up and whips himself off.
"What is it, did Blaze fail again?" The man answered.
"Yes, but I have a different job for you," I shadowy figure says, "Ever hear
of Ranma Saotome."
"Student of the Saotome school of Anything goes Karate, world class champion
so," The man answers.
"Find him and kill him.  I will fill you in on the details later.  Now, GO!!!"
The Voice Booms.
