ONWARD HHHHHOOOOOO!!!!!!   sorry, I just had a lot of rice crispy treats ^~^ 
Um this is baised on the OAV series of Tenchi Muyo! And the manga: No Need for 
Tenchi!






NO NEED FOR TENCHI WARS!
No Need for a New Hope

Some annoying music plays while some words that are  yellow flash by the screen. 
Basically an evil warlord is bent on taking over the universe, and Juria is the 
only thing in his way... yada yada yada...the screen flashes to a purple/blue 
planet...

It was a normal day on Juria. Hot and sticky.  The place was a jungle! Or a 
forest! Or Whatever!

We see a small house on a field of some weird looking plants. Inside we see a 
boy with spickey raven hair, with a little pony tail in back, and big, brown 
eyes, complaining to an older man with glasses and also had raven hair.
"But Dad!" the boy yells. "I don't want to be a farmer! I want to be part of the 
Juria Forces! Just like Grandpa!"
"Your grandfather died because he was part of the Juria Forces! I don't want 
that to happen to you!" The father Yelled. 
"I Know! But its better then farming CARROTS!" The boy complains. 
"Tenchi! Your going to farm carrots and be safe!" The father says. "Now go to 
your room!" he points. Tenchi frowns and walks in.

Inside his room, he has Little models of Jurian Guardians {the "logs"}, models 
of Jurian Ships, A model for the most famous weapon in Jurian history, The 
Tenchi-ken, Which belonged to the deceased Prince of Juria, Yosho. Of course 
Tenchi's didn't work, but he liked it anyways. He Also had a model of the most 
powerful of all Jurian Ships, Tsunami. Tsunami had gone missing a long time ago, 
and no one knew where it was. Tenchi floped on his bed, and grabbed onto his 
model Tenchi-Ken. He wondered why it had the same name as him...

Meanwhile, on the Jurian Ship, Ryou-oh, Princess Ayeka and Sasami where running 
along the halls. 
"Hurry Sasami! He's almost here!" Ayeka yelled, gripping onto her younger 
sisters hand.
"I'm trying sister! I can't keep up..!" The little blue haired girl panted, 
running out of breath. The 2 soon came to a dead end.
"Oh no!" Ayeka yelled. Sasami begun to cry. "We'll get out of this..." Ayeka  
said, hugging her younger sister to her. "Don't cry..."    she whispered.    
Just then, a little robot looking like Yume walked up. "look Sasami!" Ayeka 
pointed. 
"A droid!" Sasami said with glee.  Ayeka pulled a disk out of her cloak and gave 
it to the droid. 
"Give this to Minagi." she said. Yume beeped and waddled off. 
Then, threw the chaos,  a man walks threw, with silver hair. 
"Come with me Princess'." He says coldly. 


~~~~~~~~  

In a Jurian Escape pod, off of Ryou-oh....
Several evil looking dudes in weird white armor where lying on the floor, KO'd 
by... Yume?!
"Beep" Yume says, piloting off.

~~~~~~~~    

Tenchi hums while he plows the carrot fields. He stops and wipes his brow. 
"Phew..." he says. "Hot day." 
Some crashing is heard threw the forest just outside his home.  Then, some gun 
shots are fired threw the foliage. 
"WHOA!" Tenchi yells, ducking. 
A figure in a brown robe runs out. Followed close behind is some White 
Troopers... the bad guys. "AHHH!" Tenchi yells.
"Get her!" One of the troopers yells, firing at the robed person. 
"Run!" The robed person yells. Tenchi obliged. 
He was alone in the house. After a few moments, the gun fire stopped. Tenchi 
looked out from under the table in which his was hiding. Then, the robbed figure 
ran into his house and closed the door.
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?! DO YOU WANT ME TO BE KILLED!" Tenchi yelled. The 
person pulled the hood off to reveal... a women?! She had cyan hair that stuck 
out behind her. She had cat like yellow eyes, and pointed ears. On her cheeks 
where pink slash marks, perhaps scars. 
"Shhh." she says. "I don't know if they will be more."
"MORE?!"
"Hush!" She yells.  Out from under her rope, pops out a robot. "My name is 
Minagi. This is Yume. I need your help."
"Huh?" Tenchi looked puzzled. "What do you need from me?!" Minagi reached into 
her robe, and pulled out something. She handed it to him. It was... The hilt of 
the Tenchi-Ken?!
"WWWHHHHAAA?!" Tenchi yelled. "Is this real?!"
"Shhh!" Minagi reminded. "I will explain later. Yume, show the clip."
"Beep." Yume's eyes glow, and an image appears. 
"This is Princess Ayeka." Minagi says.
"Wow! The princess! cool!" 
{Minagi, by the time you get this message, me and Sasami will already be in the 
grasp of Darth Kagato.}
"eep! That evil dude with the little glasses!"
"Shh" Minagi commands.  
{I need your help! You're the only one that can stand up agenst him!}
"???"
{Please help us! But I have the schematics for his ship, Soja. They are inside 
this droid. Please hurry! I know he is planing to use it agenst Juria!} The 
transmission ends.
"And you need me because?"
"Do you have a cruser?" Minagi asks. 
"Yeah... but..."
"Lets go to the nearest city."
"um.. ok..."
"beep"


~~~~~~~ at a bar...

Minagi sat down at the bar, and begun to talk to people who looked like space 
pilots. Tenchi looked around nervously, never had been in a bar before.
"Hey!" a guy said madly. "That's MY Seat!" He pointed to Minagi.
"I'm sorry, I didn't see your name on it." Minagi replied cooly. 
"Why... you...!" He drew his fist back and was about to punch her. She grabbed 
his fist and stood up.
"Don't mess with forces you don't understand." She hissed. He tried again. She 
glared and ducked. She then formed a ball of energy into her palm, and formed.. 
an energy sword?! Tenchi almost fell out of his seat. Minagi sliced the mans arm 
off, and he left. Everyone was staring. Minagi calmly sat down, calling the 
sword back.
"How... How... How'd you do that?!" Tenchi whispered. "Only Deep Space Pirates 
can produce those naturally!"
"That's because I am one." Minagi sipped her sake. She looked over her shoulder. 
"Excuse me. Stay here."
Tenchi twiddled his thumps. This was Dull. Yume was sitting next to him and 
beeping happily, while sipping oil.

Minagi was surprised to see Ryo-Ohki in a bar on Juria. She walked over to the 
cabbit in human form.
"It's been a while." Minagi whispered.
"Merowww!" Ryo-Ohki meowed happily and hugged Minagi. "meow! Mew! MROW!" 
"Is Ryoko around...?"
"Mrow." Ryo-Ohki responded. "Mewr meow myyoow!"
"I See. Do you think you can help me? Hanise got destroyed in a battle"
"Mroow?"
"I need to get to the Soja."
"MEOOOOWWWW!" Ryo-Ohki looked scared.
"Can you? Me and the boy and the robot over there?" Minagi asked.
"Myroow..." Ryo-Ohki thought about it, then nodded.
"I'll meet you in the dock then." Minagi walked over to Tenchi and Yume. "Come 
with me, I  have something to tell you."
"O-ok..." Tenchi followed the space pirate.  Yume beeped and followed as well.

In the Shadows...
"Take out the Tenchi-Ken."
"Um, ok..." Tenchi pulled it out. 
"You'll learn how to use that." 
"WHAT?! I'm not even of royal blood!" Tenchi yelled.
"Focus your energy and your will to extend the blade." Minagi muttered. "Just do 
it." To Tenchi's surprise, the blade extended... but went back once it came out.
"ACK!" He fell backwards. "It.. It worked?! How?!"
"It will be explained later. Come with me. We need to get out after Soja." 
Minagi strode off.
"Wai-Wait!" Tenchi ran after her. Yume did too.

~~~~~~~ At a dock
"Oh... is this right...?" a Blond with big blue eyes and dark skin asked, 
fiddling with a cube of some sort. "Maybe this way...?"
"Just let me fix it, Mihoshi!" A women, looking surprisingly like Minagi (minus 
the marks on her cheeks).
"Mihoshi, please stop before you brake me more!" a Computer (with a head) 
muttered. 
"I- I'm sorry, Yukinojo..." Mihoshi sniffed, getting teary eyed. "I was trying 
to help..."
"Next time let Ryoko fix me..." The computer, names Yukinojo, said.
"Alright..." 
Ryo-Ohki's head popped out from a hatch. 
"Merrow!" She said. She fliped out of the hatch and closed it, and stuck a 
thumps up.
" Oh Yey!" Mihoshi hugged Ryo-Ohki. "You fixed it!"
Then 3 people and a droid walked in.
"Minagi?!" Ryoko looked as if she'd seen a ghost.
"Hi Ryoko. Yes I'm alive."
"But... Hanise exploded!"
"Yeah and...?  Well anyways I need you to take me to Soja."
"You mean Darth Kagato's ship?" Mihoshi squeeked. "But... He's scary!"
"Hush now Mihoshi. I am a 1st class Galaxy Police Ship!" Yukinojo said.
"But we're not part of the Police anymore!" Mihoshi sniffed. "Grandpa fired 
me..."
"So?! I'm still here!" Yukinojo yelled.
"Oh yeah that's right!" Mihoshi giggled.
"So who's this...?" Ryoko asked, looking at Tenchi.
"Tenchi Masaki." He said quietly. Ryoko leaned on his shoulder.
"I'm Ryoko." She purred. 
"eep...!" Tenchi got red in the face.
"Lets just go!" Minagi grabbed everyone and threw them into Yukinojo. "Yume has 
the cords for Soja."
"Um, ok..." Mihoshi said, fumbling around with the control panel. "Does this 
upload data? or is it this one...?"
"* sighs * I'll do it" Yukinojo muttered, loading the cords. from Yume into 
himself.
"Beep."
"Ok Yukinojo, head to those cords!" Mihoshi blasted off.

"So why are you here with Minagi...." Ryoko asked Tenchi, hugging him tightly.
"I have no idea!" Tenchi yelled, trying to get out of Ryoko's grasp. "Why am I 
here? why does the tenchi-ken work for me?!"
"You're the only male decentent of the Jurian Royal Throne."
"What?! How?!" Tenchi yelled, too dumb founded to think.
"Your mother...Achia {Is that right? I'm not sure...}..."
"She died when I was real young. I know we're Jurian but... we're just 
commoners! My dad's an architect!" 
"She was the daughter of Yosho." Minagi said calmly.
"... You mean to tell me the guy that was the one that PUT a bonty on my head Is 
related to Tenchi?" Ryoko yelled.
"B-bounty...?" Ryoko sweatdropped. 
"Yeah, I'm a space pirate (the worst ever at that) but I'm with Mihoshi and in 
hidding... Big deal." She muttered. Tenchi facevaulted. 
"You're the most wanted criminal in the UNIVERSE (not including Darth Kagato..) 
!!!!!?!?!?!" Tenchi yelled.
"Yeah, that pretty much covers it." Ryoko said as if it wasn't that big of a 
deal.
" AHEM!" Minagi yelled. Ryoko and Tenchi turned to her.
"What?" They asked together.
"Listen to me!" Minagi cleared her throat. "Anyways, Before Yosho... *ahem * 
passed on, he gave me Tenchi-Ken so that one day I would give it to you, 
Tenchi." Tenchi scratches his head.
"How come my dad never told me?"
"He didn't know. To him, your grandfather was only a Jurian Solider, called 
Katsiukie {Don't know about that one either O.o}"
Tenchi just about fainted then
"Oh! Poor Tenchi!" Ryoko caught him. "I'll have to nurse you back to heath!" She 
giggles and has a day dream about Tenchi falling in love with her because she 
saved his life... While Minagi sweatdropped. 
"When he wakes up, train with him." She says.
"Oh, but I couldn't hurt Tenchi-poo!" Ryoko coo's.
"Fine. I Will then." Minagi sat down waiting for Tenchi to wake up. Yukinojo 
then lowered one of his componets down.
"We're entering Enemy Territory. Ryo-Ohki is ready to depart and help defend." 
He stated blandly. Ryoko grinned and phased out, while still hanging onto 
Tenchi.
"WAIT!" Minagi yelled. "... Damnit..."

"Ok, I'm all ready here!" Mihoshi said in a shaky voice. "But I'm SCARED! WAHH!"
"Mihoshi PLEASE settle down!" Yukinojo yelled.
"Mrowww...."
"Well, me and Ryo-Ohki are all set, so leave some of it to us!" Ryoko grinned. 
Then Tenchi woke up.
"Uh..." he looked around. "AH! Where am I?!"
a Crystal with Ryo-Ohki's face in it hovered over to him. "MRRROOOWWW" she 
meowed happily.
"Your in Ryo-Ohki, my Ship." Ryoko grinned. "We're gunna be entering baddie 
territory, so it's gunna be a bumpy ride!" she giggled. 
"I'm in the furry girl?!"
"Yup ^^" 
"Yukinojo is picking up a few fighters not to far from here." Minagi said. 
" Yeah, Ryo-Ohki sees them too." Ryoko reported to her Twin. She then cracks her 
knuckles. "Lets get ready to RUMMBLE!"
"What did I Do to disserve this...?" Tenchi muttered.  
The fighters didn't  seem to notice them...
"FIRE!" Ryoko yelled. 
"MMMEEEEEYYYYAAAAAAA!" Ryo-Ohki hollowed, firing bursts of red light at them. 
NOW they noticed. The strange looking fighters returned the blasts, hitting 
Yukinojo and Ryo-Ohki a bit.
"All cannon's, FIRE!" Yukinojo ordered, as the ex-GP ship hurled attacks at the 
fighters. Soon later, they where destroyed. Minagi's image appeared on the view 
screen in Ryo-Ohki.
"I'm going to stay here in Yukinojo, you should follow us."
"Yeah I know." Ryoko responded. "Don't worry... Tenchi will be in capable 
hands!" Tenchi didn't seem to found of the idea of being alone with the Space 
Pirate. The view screen went down as Ryoko told Ryo-Ohki to follow Yukinojo. 
She then turned to Tenchi and cracked her knuckles. "Lets teach you how to use 
that thing!" She laughed triumphantly, in that usual Ryoko laugh. Tenchi gulped, 
and fumbled around with the hilt of the Tenchi-Ken. She walked up behind him and 
wrapped her arms around him and placed her hands over his... teaching him how to 
hold it. Tenchi turned beet red, but let her do so.
"Gotta hold it firmly, but not so firm that you cant maneuver it easily." She 
said. "Keep your stance somewhat wide, and keep on your toes." Tenchi did so. 
"Be prepared for anything that may come your way." she gestured for one of Ryo-
Ohki's crystals to come over. "Now, Dodge that crystal." She let go and had him 
do so.

After several hours of training, Tenchi got down the basic maneuvers and how to 
call the blade up and keep it up. Ryoko grined. 
"Time for lunch!" She said, pointing at a space station not far away. Ryoko 
teleported her and Tenchi inside of Yukinojo and Ryo-Ohki walked in later in 
human form. They ported. Mihoshi, Ryo-Ohki and Tenchi would go to get food for 
themselves and bring some back for Ryoko and Minagi. 
They found a decent looking restaurant and went inside. 
"Wow!" Mihoshi exclaimed. "This smells WOUNDERFULL!" She happily sat down and 
begun to read threw the menu. Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki followed and sat at the same 
table.
"I've never been in a space station before!" He exclaimed, looking around in 
awe. Mihoshi giggled.
"I was like that too when I 1st saw one! other then GP HQ that is!" She smiled. 
A Waiter walked up. Mihoshi ordered a bunch of sweets, Tenchi got a sandwich and 
some fries, Ryo-Ohki just ordered carrots and carrot juice. Ryo-Ohki pointed out 
some things... a lot of things. Soon the waiter brought all the food. Tenchi, 
Mihoshi and Ryo-Ohki ate... none of them talking much. Well- Mihoshi was 
babbling on about something,  but Tenchi and the cabbit weren't paying 
attention.  

~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

"We'll be entering Soja's range soon." Yukinojo reported. "We best be careful." 
"BUT I DUN WUNNA GGGOOOOOO!!!!" Wailed Mihoshi, clinging to Ryo-Ohki. Ryo-Ohki 
didn't look to thrilled with the fact. 
"We don't have a choice." Minagi added, looking at the huge warship looming 
ahead.  "We need to save Princess Ayeka and Sasami."
"HMPH!" Ryoko muttered, everyone turned and looked at the space pirate.  She was 
fuming and a vain was sticking out on her head. "Why are we going to save that 
snotty-headed princess AYEKA for anyways?!" she demanded. 
"..."  Ryoko crossed her arms.
"She's just a WORTHLESS princess!!" she added, closing her eyes. Yume suddenly 
popped up and beeped a few things. Ryo-Ohki nodded and meowed at Ryoko. "Hmph... 
if you put it that way..." she muttered.
"What did they say?" Tenchi asked. 
"Something about the secrets of Jurai." Minagi muttered.  





"Darth Kagato- I'm picking a GP ship coming in." a scout reported to a silver 
haired man with yellow eyes and little glasses. "It's just floating in... not 
even using its engines. Seem's pretty beat up to me." 
"Investigate" The silver  haired man, named Darth Kagato, muttered. 
"Right away sir!" 

Soon Yukinojo was brought in. Some dudes in weird looking suits that looked like 
they strapped a bunch of tin cans to them looked around the ship. A sound of a 
blaster came and hit one of them, a sword slashed down and cut the other, while 
the last was hit over the head with a large heavy object, destroying his skull. 
"Mihoshi and Ryo-Ohki stay here." Ryoko said, putting on the armor and grabbing 
the blaster. "Get suited up, Tenchi!" 
"Erm...?" He noticed that Minagi was suiting up too. Tenchi shrugged and put on 
the armor as well. 



Kagato walked down the halls, his cape billowing behind him. He looked at a set 
of 3 guards walking down the hall. 
"Where are you heading?" he asked.
"Uhhh...." the voice of the one in the middle muttered. "We were just heading 
down to the holding cells for our shift." Kagato raised a brow and pointed over 
his shoulder.
"Its that way." he muttered.
"Oops..." Another of them said. "Sorry sir, but we're  new here..." Kagato 
nodded.
"I see." He gestured for them to continue on their way. They did so, and he 
continued walking.



Tenchi slumped against the wall of the holding cell chamber. The other guards 
where gone... a note saying "Gone to lunch" 
"THAT WAS SO SCARY!" He exclaimed. "I didn't know Kagato was that BIG! and 
SCARY!" he fanned his face.
"Who is out there?!" A regal sounding voice echoed from one of the cell's. 
"It's just some more guards, Ayeka." A scared and child-like voice said.  The 
three walked up and looked at the 2 princesses.
"What is it do you want? It is not yet time for our lunch." the older, purple 
haired one said. All three of them took off their helmets.  "RYOKO?!" Ayeka 
yelled.
"You haven't changed a bit, Ayeka." Ryoko muttered. The two got into a heated 
argument soon after. Sasami's eyes went wide when she saw Tenchi. She tugged on 
Ayeka's dress.
"Ayeka! Ayeka!" Ayeka looked down at her  sister. "That's the boy in my dream!" 
She pointed at Tenchi. "The one who saves us!" Tenchi smiled sheepishly. 
"I'm Tenchi Masaki." he said, bowing. 
"Now's not the time." Minagi muttered, gesturing for Tenchi and Ryoko to get 
back. She pointed her palm at the barrier and blasted it, blowing it up. Ayeka 
and Sasami ran out. 
"HEY!" a voice yelled. "YOU LET THE PRISONERS OUT!"  The guards fired at the 
group. They all ducked in the door. Ryoko and Minagi fired blasts at them, while 
Tenchi used his blaster. 
"Tenchi! Ryoko! Get the princesses outta here!" Minagi yelled. 
"What about you?" Sasami asked. 
"I'll be right behind you!" She then jumped out to provide a distraction. "NOW!" 
"Lets go!" Ryoko yelled, hosting Tenchi under one arm, Sasami under another, 
with Ayeka on her back. She Hovered up in the air and flew out the door past the 
guards. 
Another wave of guards where on their way. Tenchi drew his blaster and fired at 
them sense his hands where full. Ryoko yelled threw her communicator to 
Yukinojo.
"They found us out! Get ready to go!" she  ordered. 
"Right Away!" Yukinojo said. 

Ryoko flew them until they saw Yukinojo on the hanger... Mihoshi and Ryo-Ohki 
trying to hold off the guards. And they just found out that they had arrived. 
Ryoko promptly dropped everyone to fight them off. Ayeka created some log things 
around her and Sasami as they ran for Yukinojo... reflecting the blasts right 
off. They got safely inside. 
"Oh Ryoko..." a snide male voice said. Ryoko almost flinched when she heard it. 
She turned (along with Tenchi) to see... Darth Kagato. 
"Kagato..." she muttered as if it was a curse word. 
"GAH!" Tenchi yelled. The guards now had their attention on Yukinojo. Kagato 
looked at Tenchi.
"Ah... the young prince." He smirked. "Charmed to meet you." 
"Ho..how'd you know?!" Tenchi asked
"He knows a lot..." Ryoko muttered. Kagato formed an energy sword (a green one) 
in his hand. Ryoko sneered and made her own(red).
"Kagato!" Minagi's voice yelled. He turned to look her. "To get to Ryoko, fight 
me 1st! You'll pay for blowing up Hanis!" Kagato chuckled. 
"Very well, Minagi." The two begun to fight





~~~~~~~~~~~~   


La la la.... I'm to lazy to add the fight scene. Tenchi and Ryoko are fighting 
off the guards. 

Kagato dove into Minagi, driving his blade into her stomach.  She smiled.
"So this is it...?" she asked, coughing up blood. "Then I'll take you with me!" 
She begun to crackle with power.  Yukinojo noticed that she was going to self 
destruct! He took off and flew out... leaving poor Ryoko and Tenchi behind. 
"No!" She yelled, getting in front of Tenchi before Minagi blew. The whole ship 
was destroyed.
"Lord Tenchi..." Ayeka muttered.
"TTTTEEENNNCCCHIIII! RRRRYYYOOOOKKKOOOO!!!MIIIIAAAAAGGGGIIII!!!!WWAAHH!" Mihoshi 
wailed.
"Tenchi!" Sasami cried. The symbol on her forehead
"Sasami...?" Ayeka asked. everyone turned to look at her. Soon... the girl 
vanished into thin hair. "SASAMI!" Ayeka yelled. 




"Curse that Minagi... blowing up Soja." Kagato muttered, in an escape pod. 
"We'll meet again... that's for sure."




Tenchi opened his eyes. He found himself laying down in a pod of somesort... 
naked. 
"GAH! Where'd my cloths go?!" he yelled, looking around. The pod around him 
vanished. He was in a dank room with water flowing smoothly around. There where 
soft mounds of moss everywhere, a rock here and there. The room was dimly lit. 
Where moss was not growing, was slick steel that was silver. Tree's where 
scattered around. He noticed that the light was coming up from the deep water 
chambers. He looked at the center of the room, where a huge, old tree rested. He 
stood up on the soft moss.
Directly across from him sat Ryoko, also clad in her birthday suit. She smiled 
at him and waved. Tenchi turned bright red and quickly covered up "that area."  
She chuckled.
"No need to be shy, Tenchi." She stood up as well, walking over to him. She has 
a fairly nice figure, very VERY busty. She wrapped her arms around Tenchi and 
cuddled him. He turned very VERY red. 
"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh....Ryoko!" he muttered. 
"Yes?"
"Where are we anyways?"
"Look's like we're inside a Jurain ship of some sort." She looked around. 
"Probably a 1st or 2nd generation, judging by how big the tree in here is." 
"...which one...?"  
Suddenly, a shimmering light appeared. It formed into a shape of an elegant, 
beautiful women with long blue hair in loss pig-tails. Her eyes were pink, and 
she wore Jurain garb, high class garb to be exact. She smiled.
"I am Tsunami, the ship that we ride." She said in a soft, calming tone. "And we 
are inside of myself." Tenchi fell over.
"Tenchi Darling! Are you ok?!" Ryoko asked, kneeling down to pick him up. 
"T-T-Tsunami?!" He stuttered. The women smiled and nodded. "B-B-But you 
disappeared centuries ago!" 
"I only come when I am needed." she said softly, walking over to Tenchi and 
Ryoko. "I resurrected you both from the Explosion of Soja. Though I promise that 
Kagato will build a new one." She then pointed to the water. "Look into the 
water, Tenchi. What do you see?" Tenchi glanced into the water. He blinked.
"I see 3 green triangles on my forehead..." he told her.
"Those are your Jurain markings. They only appear when in my presence or if you 
are using the Master Key as it should." Tsunami explained. 
"As it should?" 
Tsunami walked up to Tenchi and placed her hands on his cheeks, resting her 
forehead on his. 
"You must trust in your own power, Tenchi." He blinked, confused. Tsunami backed 
away. She turned to Ryoko. "Ryoko, you have importance here too." 
"Huh?" She blinked. 
"Hold out your wrists." Tsunami said. Ryoko did so. Resting on one of them was a 
red gem. "Tenchi- Ryoko's power will increases if you give her two more gems 
from the hilt of the Tenchi-Ken." he looked at it. "But- only give her one now. 
Give the other once you have mastered the Key."  Tenchi pulled a gem off of it 
and handed it to Ryoko. She held it in her hand and phased it to her right 
wrist. Tsunami held out her hand, in which was a ring. "This will give you your 
Jurain Armor." she said. "Wear it on your right ring finger, and turn it right 
to gain it. Turn left to disengage it." She handed Ryoko a seed. "This goes to 
Sasami and Ayeka. it it Ryu-Oh's seed." She opened a porthole. "This leads to 
Yukinojo. I wish you the best of luck to both of you." They walked threw- as 
their cloths returned on them. 
"Tenchi!" Mihoshi cried, hugging him. "Ryoko!" she ran over and hugged her too. 
"YOUR ALIVE!"  
"Mihoshi.... can't....breath...." Ryoko muttered. Mihoshi loosened up but 
continued to nuzzle Ryoko.
"Where's Minagi?" Sasami asked. 
"...She's gone, Princess Sasami." Tenchi said softly. Mihoshi's eyes welded up 
and she began to bawl. 
"Sasami... where did you come from?" Ayeka asked.
"From my ship!" She replied. 
"...you mean... Tsunami?" Ayeka whispered. Sasami nodded. "She's returned?" 
"Your saying that Tsunami is YOUR Ship?!" Ryoko asked, somewhat yelling. Sasami 
nodded again. 
"Tsunami resurrected Ryoko and Tenchi because their needed!... at least that's 
what she said." the blue haired princess told them. 
Yume walked in.
"Beep." She said. 
"Yume says that we should get to Jurai and return the princesses as soon as 
possible. She also says that she would like to stay with them as a protector." 
Yukinojo reported.
"She said all of that in one beep?" Ryoko muttered, sweatdropping. Ryo-Ohki and 
Yukinojo nodded. "Geez..." 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
"SASAMI!" Masaki, 2nd empress of Jurai, ran up and hugged her younger daughter. 
"YOUR ALIVE!" She then dashed over to Ayeka. "Your alive too, Ayeka!"  She 
dashed over to Tenchi, Mihoshi, Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki. "YOU SAVED MY BABIES!" she 
hugged them all. 
"Let go of my you old women!" Ryoko yelled. Masaki's eyes got all evil and a 
vein popped on her head. She pinched Ryoko's checks, pulling on them.
"Who are you calling OLD?!"  Sasami held up a sign so that only Ryoko could 
read. Ryoko quickly read it and said:
"I am very sorry young and pretty lady" she said, somewhat with discussed, and 
as best as she could with her mouth being pulled apart. Masaki smiled and hugged 
Ryoko again
"Your forgiven!" 
"Cant.... breath...."  Ryoko muttered.
Funaho, the 1st empress of Jurai smiled then turned to Tenchi.
"Thank you for bringing Ayeka and Sasami back." She said, smiling. 
"Your welcome..." Tenchi bowed. 
"You don't need to bow!" Mihoshi squeaked, trotting over to Tenchi. Tenchi 
turned red.
"uuuuhhhh...." he waved his hands in front of him. 
"But you don't!" She pointed at Tenchi. "Because you ARE Royalty!" Funaho, 
Masaki and Azusa (The Emperor), all turned to look at the brown eyed boy. 
"Is that true?" Azusa asked, eyeing Tenchi. He waved his hands more, turning 
redder.
"Ahhh...." Tenchi muttered. Ryoko phased next to him and cuddled him.
"Yup!" She giggled nuzzling him. 
"I thought he looked familiar..." Ayeka said out loud. 
"Your Yosho's grandson, aren't you?" Funaho asked. Tenchi gulped and nodded. 
Masaki ran up and hugged Tenchi tight. 
"YOU'RE MY GREAT GRANDSON!" she said happily, shaking him back and forth. 
"well.. not really... BUT!" Funaho smiled. 
"I knew Yosho married a women not from the Royal family... so you are my great 
grand son..." she said smiling at Tenchi. "You look much like him." 
"But he's more commoner then Royal!" Azusa boomed suddenly. 
"But papa- he's still one of us..." Sasami whined, giving her dad the big sad 
puppy eyes. He bit his lip, trying not to give in.
"Please dear..." Masaki pleaded. "Please can he stay?" She also gave Azusa big 
sad puppy eyes. 
"...alright..." Azusa muttered.
"Yey!" Sasami giggled. Masaki hugged Azusa. 
"Then you can stay with us." Funaho said, patting Tenchi on the shoulder. He 
grinned slightly.
"Well.... we'll be seeing you." Ryoko muttered, turning and walking away, 
choking back her tears. 
"Ryoko...?"
"Bye Tenchi!" Mihoshi hugged him and then trotted off after Ryoko. "WAIT FOR 
ME!!!" 
"Meeya.." Ryo-Ohki waved and left too. 
Tenchi watched them go. He turned back to the Royals, looking sad.
"What is the matter, Tenchi?" Ayeka asked. Tenchi glanced over his shoulder. 
"You know something, Ayeka...?"
"What is it?" she asked, cocking her head.
"Even though I was only with them for a short amount of time... I feel as though 
we were family..." he said softly. 
"But... they are nothing but an ex-GP officer and space pirates." the purple 
haired princess stated blandly.  
"I know... but..." he looked back where they left. 
"You may go if you like." Funaho said, putting her hand on Tenchi's shoulder. 
"It is not our place to stop you. If that is where you feel you belong... go." 
Sasami grabbed onto Tenchi's shirt.
"Please take me with you!" she asked. 
"What?" Masaki asked.
"I want to stay with Tenchi!" the blue haired princess said. "Please can I go 
with?" 
"I will go with Sasami to see that she is safe." Ayeka added. 
"If that is what you want..." Azusa said.
"JUST WRITE TO ME!" Masaki sniffed. 
"We will!" Sasami smiled, hugging her parents. 
"Best get going before they leave" Funaho stated. Tenchi nodded and ran off, 
Ayeka and Sasami following.

"We are clear to go." Yukinojo reported. Mihoshi flopped down in the seat and 
begun to power up the engine.
"WAIT!" Tenchi's voice yelled. 
"huh?" Ryoko zoomed in on Yukinojo's screen and saw Tenchi, Sasami and Ayeka 
running towards them.  
"We want to come with!" Tenchi yelled.
"REALLY?!" Mihoshi squeaked. She lowered the ramp allowing them to board. Once 
Tenchi got in he was imminently hugged by the blond. Ryoko phased in front of 
Tenchi, pushed Mihoshi aside and cuddled the prince.
"Un-hand him!" Ayeka yelled at Ryoko.
"Why's that?" Ryoko sneered, lowering her eyelid and sticking out her tongue. 
"Meya! MREOW!" Ryo-Ohki stated, indicating that everyone should hold on for take 
off. 

It went along smoothly, as Tenchi smiled to himself and thought
