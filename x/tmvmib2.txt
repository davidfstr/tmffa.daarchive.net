Part 1:  Tenchi Muyo! versus Men in Black
By William Benjamin Grilliette  (evilpii@juno.com)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 2

Scene 1

{In a black silence, the sound of surf hitting the beach is slowly heard.  A bright light starts
to filter into the darkness.  Suddenly, eyes are opened to show a beautiful morning on Manhattan
Bay.  Ayeka lays on the beach and sleepily sits up gazing at the water.  In the water, the spines
and bridge of Ryo-Ohki float above the surface of the surf.  Ships painted black pull up near to
Ryo-Ohki and start throwing towlines to the ship.}

Ayeka:  {To herself.}  Who are they...?

{Washu's voice comes from behind Ayeka.}

Washu:  {Seriously.}  The Men in Black, the United States's idea of controlling the
	extraterrestrial population.

{Camera pans to the side to see Washu standing behind Ayeka.}

Ayeka:  {Turns to Washu.}  Miss Washu?  {Rubs her head as she stands.}  What happened...?

Washu:  {Ironic.}  The Arquillian battlecruiser we were going to investigate shot an energy
	weapon that grazed Ryo-Ohki's hull and sent her into a spin that landed us in Manhattan
	Bay in the United States.  {Indicates the black ships again.}  Now, we're in their
	jurisdiction.  They'll arrest us when they find us.

Ayeka:  {Hurried.}  Is there a way to escape?

Washu:  {Smiles to herself.}  Oh, of course!  Think, Ayeka.  I am Ryoan just like Ryoko after
	all!

{Washu holds her hands before her and summons energy into a doorway before her and Ayeka.  Behind
Ayeka and Washu, two black cars and a black van speed to a stop behind them.  Washu holds her
head and stumbles.  Ayeka steadies Washu as men in black and white business suits file out of the
vehicles.  Ayeka pulls Washu into the gateway which closes behind them.  The men hurry down to
where Ayeka and Washu were with silver weapons in their hands.  They look around furiously and
find nothing.  The leader, who is fairly young and almost naive, pulls out a small phone-like
communicator and speaks into it.}

Leader:  Zed, the Juraian and Ryoan escaped us into some... light... thing...

{Across the communicator, a familiar voice replies with his hardened and experienced voice.}

Zed:  That's fine, R.  Get your clean up crew to work and then hurry back.  We'll find them.

R:  Right, boss.  {Turns to the crew.}  You heard him!  Get to it!

{The MiB team gets to their clean up jobs as R looks at where Ayeka and Washu's running
footprints end.  Cut to an old and ruined motel room where Ayeka eases Washu onto a bed.  Ayeka
stands before Washu while Washu settles herself.  The room is furnished like an ordinary motel
room:  two beds, a table with chairs, and a bathroom with shower.}

Ayeka:  {Concerned.}  Are you alright, Washu?  You seem tired.

Washu:  {Waves Ayeka off.}  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Just that I'm not used to using that power like
	Ryoko is.

Ayeka:  You are sure?

Washu:  {Smiles.}  Yeah, yeah.  Quit worrying, Ayeka.

{Ayeka sits on the bed opposite Washu.}

Ayeka:  {Calmly.}  Washu, could you tell me more about these Men in Black?  I have had no
	experience with them.

Washu:  I haven't either.  They're a secretive group that supposedly regulates the transit of
	alien races on Earth.  {Sarcastic.}  But, we both know how much control they have there.
	{Smiles some.}

Ayeka:  {Serious.}  Whatever the legal case, Washu, they are trying to capture us.  They have
	Ryo-Ohki already.

Washu:  {Nods.}  That means they have Ryoko too.

Ayeka:  {Confused.}  What do you mean?  Ryoko would not allow herself to be captured.

Washu:  You're right.  Ryoko wouldn't ALLOW herself to be captured.  {Looks to Ayeka very
	serious.}  But, Ryoko is unconscious on Ryo-Ohki's bridge.

Ayeka:  She is...?

Washu:  You don't remember last night, do you?  The crash?

{Ayeka closes her eyes.  In her mind's eye, she sees the Arquillian battlecruiser fire and impact
Ryo-Ohki.  On Ryo-Ohki's bridge, Washu puts a field around herself and Ayeka while Ryoko holds
Ryo-Ohki's controls.  Ayeka opens her eyes to see the room and Washu.}

Ayeka:  {Surprised.}  Ryoko was not in the field...

Washu:  {Shakes her head.}  Nope.  I couldn't protect her and allow her to control Ryo-Ohki.
	Shields and telepathy don't work that way.

Ayeka:  She and Ryo-Ohki are the only ones for us to return to Lord Tenchi in Japan?

Washu:  Yeah, we'll have to break them out of the MiB facility.  Unfortunately, my instruments
	can't find it.  It's well shielded.

Ayeka:  What about those like ourselves, those not native to Earth?  Might they know where their
	headquarters is?

Washu:  {Smiles.}  Now, that's a plan.  {Pauses.}  But!  we have one matter to attend to first!

Ayeka:  {Curious.}  What's that, Washu?

{Washu indicates the bathroom.  Ayeka is confused.  Washu stands and walks to the bathroom and
motions for Ayeka to follow.  Ayeka slowly follows as the screen fades to white.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{Fade from the white to a bright white light hanging from the ceiling of a futurist room.
Ryoko's eyes open looking to the side.  Her face winces as she slowly sits up.  Her left hand is
placed firmly against the left side of her abdomen as if it was the source of the pain.  She
cracks one eye and scans the room:  one ventilation duct behind the light, a door without a
handle, and the bed she is laying on.  Her pain subsides, and she releases her side and opens
both eyes normally.  Ryoko sits on the edge of the bed.}

Ryoko:  {Thinking.}  I've been captured...  That's nothing new...  {Smiles to herself.}
	Definitely not a problem...!

{Ryoko stands and walks to just before the door.  She raises her hand and summons red energy to
her palm.  This newly formed ball of light suddenly flies to the door and impacts an otherwise
invisible wall before the door and melts away into it.  Ryoko blinks.}

Ryoko:  {Quietly.}  What the hell...?!

{Ryoko generates the energy pulse again and fires with the same effect on the door.  Ryoko gets
an almost scared look on her face.  She recreates the ball of red energy in her hand and then
wraps her hand around it forming it into an energy sword.  She swipes at the door.  Her sword
collides with the invisible wall creating white and red sparks which fly in all directions as she
tries to cut the wall.  Ryoko strains to try and cut the wall until she pulls the sword away
breathing hard.  She steps away from the door with a look in her eyes like a caged animal.}

Ryoko:  {Thinking to herself.}  I'm trapped...  alone...!  I'm alone...!  I'm alone...!!  Where's
	Ryo-Ohki...?!

{The same voice that spoke to R on his communicator echos in Ryoko's room.  Strangely, she can
understand what he says.}

Zed:  Case number 80812029, the space pirate Ryoko from planet Ryua.

{Ryoko looks up at the voice.  She takes a breath and calms herself.  Her confidence returns.}

Ryoko:  {To the voice.}  And you are?

Zed:  You can call me Zed.  I am the head of the MiB of planet Earth, and you are an unregistered
	extraterrestrial on my planet.

Ryoko:  {Taps her toe.}  How about telling me about the part where I care, Zed?

Zed:  {Scoffs.}  Well, I'll get to the point.  You, Ryoko, are charged with crimes of piracy and
	malicious mischief.

Ryoko:  {Surprised.}  What?!  After all I've done for Jurai, they and the Galaxy Police STILL
	won't cancel those warrants?!

Zed:  We know about your help in the coup on Jurai, but Jurai did not decide to cancel your
	warrants under Emperor Azusa Jurai.

Ryoko:  {Scoffs.}  Well without me, he wouldn't be emperor!

Zed:  That might be so, but he didn't help you any.  In the eyes of the law, you are a pirate,
	Ryoko.  As one, a liaison officer from the GP will be here soon to take you to the
	temporary headquarters outside the Terran sytem.

Ryoko:  {Impertanent.}  Yeah, right!

Zed:  We have your Ryo-Ohki.  As to your two friends from the bay, we have agents looking for
	them.  They'll stick out like sore thumbs in Manhattan.  You have no way to escape,
	Ryoko.  You will be turned over to the GP for trial.

{Ryoko closes her eyes and tries to clear her mind.  Her sword vanishes from her hand.  Her mind
searches for Ryo-Ohki's mind nearby.  She concentrates hard as the field around the room also
suppresses her telepathy with her ship.  In a nearby docking bay, Ryo-Ohki is held up by braces
surrounded by MiB personnel.  On Ryo-Ohki's bridge, all the systems are seemingly shut down.
Suddenly, one window opens with a waveform analysis.  Above this waveform, the name "Ryoko" is
printed.  Ryo-Ohki meows weakly but happily.  Back in Ryoko's cell, Ryoko smiles slightly.}

Ryoko:  {In her mind.}  Ryo-Ohki...!  You're not hurt bad...  You'll be flying soon...  {Kindly.}
	I'm glad you're alright...  Take care for a little while...  We'll get out of here...

Zed:  {To Ryoko.}  I hope you'll be peaceful when the liaison arrives, but I'm sure you've dealt
	with GP officers before.

Ryoko:  {Opens her eyes.}  Yeah, Zed.  I have, and you're not much different from them.

Zed:  We'll see when your time comes.

Ryoko:  {Smiles.}  I'm sure we will.

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{Within MiB HQ, agents scurry about their jobs while alien visitors and residents come and go in
an INS/border type organization.  In this airport-like situation, MiB agents J and L walk through
the other characters with relative ease.  L holds her hands as if they were in pain.  J looks
over to her.}

J:  You okay?

L:  {Nods.}  Yeah,  {Sarcastically.}  if you like having your fingerprints burned off.

J:  {Laughs to himself.}  Yeah, that hurt when they did it to me.  {Smiles a little.}  You'll
	get over it.

L:  I guess I'll have to.  {Looks back to J with a small smile.}  Of course, I have you to thank
	for all this too.

J:  Well, it's either this or forget everything that happened last night.

L:  {Shakes her head.}  Never mind, J.

J:  {Sighs.}  Laurel.

{J and L both stop together.  J gets very serious as he speaks to L.}

J:  You saw what I had to do to K.  {Looks into L's eyes.}  Don't make me have to do it again.

L:  {Nods.}  I won't.

J:  {Smiles to himself.}  Cool.  {Nods to Zed's office above them.}  Let's go to work.

L:  {Smiles lightly.}  Yeah.

{Cut to J and L sitting before Zed in his briefing room.  J is fairly relaxed while L is rather
stiff and proper when dealing with Zed.}

Zed:  J, there's been a change in the Rosenberg case.  R and his boys recovered an Ohki class
	organic ship from the bay this morning.  It was hit by the same warning shot from the
	Arquillian battlecruiser that blasted the North Pole last night.

J:  {Sarcastic.}  Well, the pilot was smart.  He shouldn't have got in the thing's way.

Zed:  Actually, the pilot was a she, J.  She's a highly wanted space pirate by the name of Ryoko
	from the planet Ryua.  {Looks to L.}  She's Galaxy Police case 80812029 if you want to
	look her up.

J:  {Confused.}  Galaxy Police?  You never said anything about any Galaxy Police.

Zed:  It didn't seem important at the time since we were trying to save the world, slick.  The
	Galaxy Police are the primary law enforcement organization in the galaxy.  They have two
	resident officers per solar system, and with us, they have one liaison officer.
	Essentially, we report to them.

J:  {Scoffs.}  So, there's actually someone you answer to, Zed?  {Laughs to himself.}

Zed:  {Scowls.}  Well, laugh all you want, but you two have a job to do now.  Ryoko had two
	accomplices.  Their spectral trails read out as a Juraian and another Ryoan.

L:  {Curious and sarcastic.}  Zed, could you describe them a little more?  J and I don't know all
	the races in the galaxy like other people around here.

Zed:  Since you asked, a Juraian comes from the ancient world of Jurai.  Their traditions are
	long held and respected.  {Looks to J.}  J, if you thought the Arquillians were
	important, the Jurai are ten times that.  {To both.}  Also, the spectral trail of this
	Juraian is consistent with a Juraian noble.  It could be a lord or lady.  Juraians
	usually have blue or purple hair, usually arranged in multiple ponytails.  In either
	case, be very careful.  They're also reported to be extremely powerful.  Read the GP
	records on the Kagato coup on Jurai.  Though pretty exaggerated, it'll give you an idea
	of what to expect.

J:  {Scoffs.}  Come on, Zed.  One little high-class royal can't be that much trouble!

Zed:  {Laughs to himself.}  You'd be surprised, J.  As to the Ryoan, that race is notorious for
	their mischief, but Ryoko is more than normal.  She can throw fireballs, fly, teleport
	from place to place... She's everything you don't want to deal with.  Lucky for you two,
	this second Ryoan isn't with Ryoko.  The kid's only about twelve and shouldn't have any
	power like that.

L:  That's a good sign.

Zed:  Ryoans also typically keep their hair up in spikes of some kind.  They too have
	multicolored hair.  Both should be easy to find.

J:  {Sarcastically.}  What's with these alien people and looking weird anyway?

Zed:  Well, people, I want you two to find the missing aliens.  L, this will be your first real
	case.  Do as J tells you.  He's had training from the best.

L:  {Nods.}  Yes, sir.

Zed:  {Leans back in his chair.}  Now, go get me some aliens!  Don't just sit there!

{J and L stand and leave the briefing room onto the catwalks above the INS bureaus of MiB HQ.
Fade to a newstand in downtown Manhattan.  J gathers a fresh set of tabloid papers.  He sets this
set of tabloid papers down as he takes two hotdogs from a nearby hotdog vendor.  He looks over
the covers of the magazines.  One with ex-MiB agent K (AKA Kevin Cunningham) on the cover with
his old girlfriend peaks J's interest.  He puts on his custom sunglasses and picks all these
items up.  L calls to him.}

L:  Hey, J.

{J turns around to see L leaning against their car.}

L:  Zed called.  The High Consulate of Salaxium 9 wants floor seats for the Nicks-Bulls game.

J:  {Walks to the car.}  Alright, let's put in a call to Dennis Rodman.  He's from that planet.
	{Hands L a hotdog.}

L:  {Amazed.}  Rodman?  You're kidding.

J:  Nope.  {Enters the car.}

L:  {Sarcastically.}  Not much of a disguise.

{L enters the car, and the vehicle's engine starts.  The black Ford pulls forward into traffic.
Within the cab, J hands the tabloids to L who starts to thumb through them.  L takes a bite from
her hotdog and continues to read.}

L:  I see some stuff in here about the crash, but nothing about where those two could be hiding.

J:  Well with what Zed said, they shouldn't be that hard to find.  {Smiles a bit.}  Time to bring
	in some old favors.

{The MiB car rounds the next corner and disappears in traffic.}
