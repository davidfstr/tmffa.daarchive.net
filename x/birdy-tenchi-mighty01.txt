Tenchi Muyo! is owned by Pioneer. Birdy the Mighty is owned by US Manga Corps. I 
don't own either of these companies nor do I own any of these characters. This 
is all in fun so if any big executives are reading this, don't sue me because 
I'm only 15 and got $50 to my name and you won't get much more than that out of 
me. So, just don't sue me, thanks.

Okay this is one of my first fan fics ever. It should be good and I hope that 
you all like it. So now without further ado ((or however you fancy people say 
it)) here is No Need for Birdy, Part I...




"Tenchi, dinners ready." Sasami's voice seemed to echo throughout the whole 
house as she called Tenchi and the gang to dinner. No sooner than the words has 
escaped her mouth, the table was already full with hungry mouths and dirty 
hands, picking through her tasty meal.
"Wow, you guys must all be hungry," said Sasami.
"Off course Sasami. Whenever you cook, we know it must be good," responded 
Tenchi.
"Mya-Mya-Meow," agreed Ryo-Ohki.
"Aw, you guys."
	No sooner than did everyone reach the table and begin to eat than the food 
disappeared. In a small platter, only a small rice ball remained. Ryoko and 
Ayeka looked at each other. Their eyes met. Suddenly, their chopsticks met in 
the middle of the platter.
"Ryoko," Ayeka started," you know very well that I was here first."
"You liar," replied Ryoko. "I as well as you know that I deserve it. You had 
like fifty, you pig."
"PIG!?! Why you... you...you..." 
"Shhh. Don't use any harsh language, you don't want to hurt little Sasami's 
ears."
Then while Ayeka and Ryoko were arguing, Ryo-Ohki jumped out from atop Sasami's 
head and snatched the rice ball.
"Mya-Mya-Mya-Meow!"
Angry as hell, Ryoko grabbed Ryo-Ohki by the scruff of her neck..
"Why you little rice ball stealer."
"Knock it off you two," Tenchi started. "I'm tired of your fighting. I got to go 
to Okayama tonight to pick up the test results and I don't need any of your 
fighting."
"Uh, sorry Lord Tenchi," replied Ayeka.
"Sorry, Tenchi."
"Okay you two. Well I'm going know see you later."
Tenchi, putting on his shoes, stepped out the door. Unknown to Tenchi, this 
would be that last night of his normal un-normal life.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Bye thanks," said Tenchi as he stepped out of the bus.
	Okayama was a beautiful, and dangerous, town at night just as Tenchi was 
just about to find out. Tenchi began to stroll the streets walking to his 
school. Soon he would find out the scores of his entrance exam. No sooner than 
had Tenchi turned a corner than a he bumped into a man. The man had a look of 
fright in his eyes. He looked at Tenchi.
"You got to help me man. She's coming to get me. You got to hide me."
	Tenchi shocked pushed the man away. The man fell back on his butt and just 
got back up.
"Get away," yelled Tenchi.
"Please help me!."
"Well, okay. Follow me."
	Tenchi took the man to a small area in the park that was shrouded by a 
group of bushes.
"Don't worry, nobody can find you here. So, what are you running from?"
"A monster," the man replied. "A big evil demon. She after me, trying to take me 
to her evil lair so that she can..."
BOOM
	An explosion nearby sent Tenchi and the man flying through the air. Tenchi 
seemed to land on his back, while the man landed on his feet. Looking over at 
Tenchi, the man grabbed him and took him off.
"Let me go you big... muff."
	The man grabbed his mouth and held it shut. He then took Tenchi to the top 
of a bridge to hide. At the bottom of the bridge, a woman with red and white 
hair appeared.
"Okay Usanagi. Come out with your hands up. You can't escape."
"I don't think so, Birdy"
	Without warning, Usanagi threw Tenchi off the top of the bridge at the 
Birdy. Birdy caught Tenchi and with her gloves sent a high voltage shock through 
his body. After a few seconds, she realized that whom she had in her hands was 
not Usanagi. She stopped but was too late. Tenchi was convulsing, his eyes were 
white.
"Hahahaha! Birdy, you just killed a human. Now you're in trouble."
	Usanagi, done laughing, began to jump away. Birdy looking down at Tenchi, 
who was still convulsing, began to swear.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"I'm not so sure of this captain. It's never been done, and I don't want to do 
it."
"Don't worry. Besides, you killed him unrightfully. He deserves to live. Now get 
in there!"
	Tenchi barely conscious noticed and woman coming straight at him, then 
dark.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Morning, Tenchi."
"Ahhhhhhhh!"
	Tenchi fell out of bed at the sight of Ryoko's face sticking out of the 
wall. Picking himself up, Tenchi stared up at her.
"Ryoko, what are you doing here."
"Well," replied Ryoko, "I came to check up on you. When you came home last 
night, you acted a little strange. I thought you had the lichen snots."
"Ryoko," Tenchi said looking at her blankly, "it's called the chicken pox and 
I've already had them. Plus, I don't remember coming home last night."
"Well, you must have been so shocked about your score that you must have 
forgotten."
"My test? MY TEST?!? Oh damn it. I totally forgot about it. That means I have to 
go there today."
"Don't worry, we can all go there later. First, let's eat breakfast."
	Ryoko then disappeared, giving Tenchi time to change before going 
downstairs.
<What's the matter with me. Why can't I remember what happened last night.>
	As soon as Tenchi reached the table, the doorbell rang.
"I'll get it," said Tenchi.
	Tenchi got up and walked to the door. When he opened to door a tall man 
with a brown raincoat stood in the doorway.
"Hello, can I help you."
"Yes you can," replied the man robotically.
	Then without warning, the man threw a punch straight at Tenchi's head...
