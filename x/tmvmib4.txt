Part 1:  Tenchi Muyo! versus Men in Black
By William Benjamin Grilliette  (evilpii@juno.com)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Act 4

Scene 1

{A pencil meets paper and writes lines along the paper.  As the lines form, Ryoko's face appears.
Then, Ayeka's face is constructed next to Ryoko's.  Both are smiling to the artist as he writes
their names in Japanese below the faces.  Next to the faces are differential equations from a 
student's homework.  Pan up to see Tenchi's eyes closed as his pencil dances across the page.
His eyes open sleepily to the page before him and blinks in surprise.  His face then goes solemn
at the faces and names.  Alone in his room designed by his parents, Tenchi speaks quietly to
himself.  Moonlight enters the room through the skylight showing a beautiful evening.}

Tenchi:  Ryoko...  Ayeka...

{Flashback to TM!iL.  Tenchi sits with Washu's headset on over his eyes wearing his blue
battlesuit and Ryoko and Ayeka behind him.  Tenchi suddenly throws his head back as his mind
merges with Achika's.  Concern is written across both of the girl's faces.  Face back to Tenchi's
room.}

Tenchi:  {Sighs.}  I...  I know you both...  {Closes his eyes.}  I don't want to hurt you...  I
	care for you both...  {Rubs his hands through his hair.}  I don't know...!!  You've been
	gone for the past two days without a word...!!  I pray you're not hurt...!!  {Clinches
	his eyes.}  hurt with me here...!!

{Sasami's young and kind voice rings out from the hallway and stairs.}

Sasami:  Tenchi!  Time for your treatment!

{Tenchi opens his eyes and turns his head in Sasami's direction.}

Tenchi:  I'll be there in a second, Sasami!  {Looks back to the paper.}  I...  I swear I won't
	hurt you...  {Stands and straightens himself somewhat weakly.}  I'll protect you...

{Tenchi walks with a little difficulty to the door and exits the room.  The house is surprisingly
quiet this morning with only the sound of Sasami over the stove to break the silence as Tenchi
descends the staircase to the ground floor.  Tenchi enters the kitchen to see Sasami standing on
a small ladder allowing her to stir the pot before her.  She hears Tenchi's uneven steps and
looks over to him.}

Sasami:  There you are!  {Hops down the ladder.}  It's time for Ryu-Oh's sap, Tenchi!

{Sasami takes a small Japanese teacup from the counter and offers it to Tenchi.  Tenchi accepts
the cup and bows in thanks.  Sasami does also.}

Tenchi:  Thank you, Sasami.  I know I've been a burden to you.

Sasami:  {Smiles.}  That's alright.  It's nothing I can't handle.

{Tenchi smiles at Sasami and rubs her head which makes her giggle.  Tenchi takes the teacup
gently and speaks under his breath.}

Tenchi:  I thank you, Ryu-Oh...

{Tenchi sips the contents of the cup and sets the cup down.  A subtle glow envelops Tenchi and
then passes.  Sasami looks on happily.}

Sasami:  You feel better, Tenchi?

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  Yes, thank you, Sasami.

{Nobuyuki's voice comes from the hallway.}

Nobuyuki:  Tenchi?

{Tenchi and Sasami both turn to see Nobuyuki walk around the corner and into the kitchen.
Nobuyuki looks Tenchi over.}

Nobuyuki:  You're looking a lot better today, Tenchi.  {Thinks.}  What could have hurt you that
	bad anyway?  Only time I got laid up like that was when I broke my leg in high school...
	{Thinks.}  I still don't know how that happened...

{Tenchi and Sasami both teardrop and smile wryly.  A knock comes to the door.  Nobuyuki turns to
get the door when Tenchi speaks stopping him.}

Tenchi:  I'll get it, Dad.

Nobuyuki:  {Looks to Tenchi.}  Huh?

{Tenchi walks past Nobuyuki with ease, as if Tenchi was not hurt at all.}

Tenchi:  I'll get the door.

Nobuyuki:  If you think you're up to it.

{Tenchi nods and hurries ahead to the door.  Nobuyuki looks after him a little surprised.}

Nobuyuki:  He was laid up in bed for months, and he's just alright all of a sudden?

Sasami:  Ryu-Oh healed him again.

Nobuyuki:  {Looks down to Sasami.}  That sap must be strong stuff.

Sasami:  Only for a Juraian though.  {Smiles.}

Nobuyuki:  {Teardrop.}  Oh...

{Tenchi opens the door to see Mihoshi and Kiyone standing on the other side in the night.  Tenchi
bows in welcome to them.  Kiyone smiles back while Mihoshi waves her hellos.}

Mihoshi:  Hi, Tenchi!

Tenchi:  Kiyone, Mihoshi.  Please, come in.

Kiyone:  Thanks, Tenchi.

{Mihoshi and Kiyone both enter the home as Tenchi shuts the door behind them.  Sasami and
Nobuyuki leave the kitchen and join with Tenchi, Mihoshi, and Kiyone in the living room.}

Kiyone:  Is Washu around, Tenchi?  We need to talk to her about a ship that entered the
	atmosphere this morning.

Tenchi:  {Shakes his head.}  She hasn't been here in two days.  She, Ryoko, and Ayeka left on
	Ryo-Ohki to check out an Arquillian battlecruiser she found in orbit.  Do you know
	anything about it?

Kiyone:  {Nods.}  Yes, that battlecruiser was sent by the Arquillian royalty to reacquire an item
	left by a prince that died a day before.  An agency in the United States settled the
	situation.

Nobuyuki:  {Confused.}  The United States?  I thought the Galaxy Police were the main police
	force out here.

Mihoshi:  Oh, no!  We are.  It's just that we have help from an agency in the US called the Men
	in Black.

Sasami:  {Curious.}  The Men in Black?  Who are they?

Kiyone:  {Sighs.}  Well, I guess I should explain them.  They play a big part in foreign
	relations around here.  According to the Galaxy Police records, the American government
	started a small and underfunded agency to contact extraterrestrial races.  To them, the
	agency remained classified and only a few insiders knew it existed.  They get their name
	from their simple dress code of a black business suit.  Now, they operate completely
	outside the jurisdiction or knowledge of the world governments and receive funding
	through stolen technologies that have been patented in the US.  Mihoshi and I rarely have
	to deal with them since our jurisdiction pretty much ends once we enter the atmosphere,
	except in pursuit cases like Ryoko.

Nobuyuki:  So, why didn't a Men in Black agent come here when you girls all crashed here?

Mihoshi:  Actually, that's what we're going to ask them!

Tenchi:  {Confused.}  Huh?

Kiyone:  Mihoshi's right.  We're going to the MiB headquarters in New York to try and find out
	more about the landing last night.  It might have been a hostile.  We thought Washu might
	have more information already.

Tenchi:  Can you get them to look for Washu and the others?

Kiyone:  Maybe, but if they found Ryoko, it'd be a hard matter of keeping her from being
	imprisoned.

Tenchi:  That's why Sasami and I'll come with you.

Nobuyuki:  {Teardrop.}  Say what?!  You were limping this morning, and now you're wanting to go
	to the US?!

Tenchi:  {Turns to Nobuyuki.}  Dad, I need to go and be sure they're alright.  Besides, Ayeka,
	Sasami, and I could have enough political weight to keep Ryoko from being put in jail.

{Nobuyuki looks into Tenchi's eyes and sees his kind determination.  Nobuyuki flashes back to
when he saw that look before:  TM!TV#24.  Tenchi stands in Yagami's boarding tube with Ryoko,
Azaka, and Kamidake.  Nobuyuki stands with Sasami, Mihoshi, Nagi, and Ken-Ohki.  Tenchi's quiet
determination is the same as it is now as he stands with Sasami, Mihoshi, and Kiyone.  Nobuyuki
sighs.}

Nobuyuki:  Alright, Tenchi.  Go look after them.  Grandpa and I'll keep the house safe.  You
	just keep safe, okay?

Tenchi:  {Nods.}  I will.

Kiyone:  {Concerned.}  Tenchi, are you sure you're ready for this?  After all, Kain did hurt
	you pretty bad last year.

Tenchi:  {Confident.}  I'm alright thanks to Sasami and Ryu-Oh.  I'll be fine.  I promise.

Mihoshi:  {With a little pout.}  Come on, Kiyone!  We all want to see America!  {Looks to
	Sasami.}  Right, Sasami?

Sasami:  {Looks with a small pout to Kiyone.}  Yes, Ms. Kiyone.  We'd like to see America too!

Kiyone:  {Sighs with a teardrop.}  Alright...  I can't win against you both...

{Mihoshi and Sasami skip and cheer together.}

Mihoshi & Sasami:  We're going to America!  We're going to America!

Tenchi:  Could be worse, Kiyone.  We could have Nagi and try to keep her from Ryoko.  {Smiles
	wryly.}

Kiyone:  Don't say that, Tenchi.  We don't need this trip cursed.

{Fade out on that ironic statement.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{A beam of morning sunlight enters a dirty window and falls upon Ryo-Ohki who lays on the
window ledge asleep.  The cabbit stirs and opens her eyes to the light and blinks from the
glare.  She stretches and then sits up looking at the motel room Ayeka and Washu had been
using.    Scorch marks line the room from weapon fire and energy bursts.  A small battle was
waged here the previous night.  Ayeka and L sleep on the two beds, Washu and J in the chairs
around the table, and Ryoko between the beds propped up against Ayeka's.  Ayeka and Washu have
returned to their normal attire, hair color, and style.  J holds his standard sidearm in hand
with the counter reading "00".  Ryo-Ohki's stomach growls.  She hops off the window ledge and
scurries over to Washu and jumps in her lap.  Ryo-Ohki meows softly to Washu who stirs from the
noise.  Washu blinks sleepily and looks down to Ryo-Ohki.}

Washu:  {Quietly.}  What is it, Ryo-Ohki...?

{Ryo-Ohki meows again rubbing her belly.  Washu realizes what Ryo-Ohki wants when J stirs some.
Washu glances to J and then back to Ryo-Ohki.}

Washu:  What say I get Ayeka and L to get some food while you stay here and keep those two from
	blowing the place up, huh?

{Ryo-Ohki meows sadly to Washu.  Washu pets Ryo-Ohki.}

Washu:  I know you want to go, but we can't take you in the restaurants, you know?

{Ryo-Ohki nods and meows sadly still.}

Washu:  {Kindly.}  We'll find some carrots.  I promise.  {Smiles a little.}

{Ryo-Ohki smiles and meows happily.  Washu places her on the table and goes to Ayeka's side.
Fade to outside the motel room where Ayeka, Washu, and L are found walking away from the door.
Ayeka is gently inserting a small, fish-like device into her ear.}

Ayeka:  Thank you for the translator device, Washu.

Washu:  {Smiles widely.}  Oh, it's no problem.  I thought the mecha-Babelfish might help a
	little.

Ayeka:  {With a slight glare.}  You could have given it to me sooner.

{Washu shows a toothy grin after which Ayeka sighs heavily and turns to L.}

Ayeka:  So, Agent L.  Where are we going?

L:  I thought that going to McDonald's would be simple enough to get food for everyone.  It's
	run by a Pentinian merchant that gives MiB agents free food and discounts.

Washu:  {Smiles.}  Sounds like a cozy deal for you.

L:  {Defensive.}  Hey, I don't make the deals.  This is only my second day on the job.

Ayeka:  {Teardrop.}  You mean to tell us that you are an amateur MiB agent?

L:  {Sarcastic.}  Princess Jurai, I didn't know the MiB existed until a giant cockroach
	kidnapped me.

Ayeka:  {Surprised.}  A giant cockroach?

Washu:  {Plainly.}  A bug, Ayeka.

L:  {Nods.}  That's what K and J called it.

Ayeka:  {Thinks.}  Bug... bug... I don't remember a creature called that.

Washu:  Bugs aren't your run of the mill roaches, Ayeka.  They're a race of total destruction.

{Flashback to MiB.  J and L hold their pulse series weapons at the Edgar skinned bug standing
on the gantry to the Roswell ship at the World's Fair in Queens.  The creature has its hands
behind its head as it rips the head open and unfolds from the skin to be a bug.}

Washu:  Wherever they go, death and chaos reign.  Each is a minimum of six meters in length
	with strength about like Ryoko's, heavy armor, and razor sharp talons.  These things also
	have a stinger and even the ability to fold their body into a smaller form for disguise.
	They even enjoy stealing human skins to wear.

{Return to present day.  Ayeka is aghast and disgusted from the description.  L is cool about
the whole matter.}

L:  That sounds right.  Before I became MiB, a bug came here and stole the galaxy from an
	Arquillian prince.

Ayeka:  Arquillian prince?  {Realizes.}  That is why the battlecruiser was in orbit!

L:  Battlecruiser?

Washu:  {Nods.}  Yeah, there was an Arquillian battlecruiser in orbit of Earth the night we
	crashed.  It had Earth targetted, and the blast grazed our ship and caused the crash.

L:  {To herself somewhat irate.}  I need to talk to J...!

Ayeka:  You mentioned the galaxy.  Did the bug obtain it?

L:  {Shakes her head.}  No, J and K got it back and returned it to the Arquillians.

Washu:  And, the battlecruiser's probably not in orbit anymore.  That's what Ryoko meant by the
	battlecruiser being here for something in particular.  It was here to deliver the galaxy
	from the bug's hands safely.

L:  What is the galaxy exactly?  The bug kept mentioning it, but never said what it was.

Washu:  The galaxy is just what the name infers, a celestial galaxy.  It just happens that this
	galaxy is a miniature the size of a jewel.  Though small, the galaxy still retains all
	the energy and matter that a normal sized galaxy has, making it an ideal energy source.

Ayeka:  If these creatures were to obtain it, they would have the capability to create weapons
	with undreamedof power.

L:  Well, I guess we're lucky they didn't get it.

Washu:  More than you probably realize, L.

L:  But if the galaxy was taken by the Arquillians, what was that thing last night?

Washu:  {Folds her arms in thought.}  I don't know.  I have no data on a creature like that.

L:  It looked like a bug... but a mantis instead of a roach.

Washu:  True, but there is no known race constructed like that.  Also, the sudden color change
	bothers me.

L:  You mean the way it changed it's skin color every so often before it attacked?

{Washu nods.}

Ayeka:  It reminded me of Ryoko's battlesuit which you gave her, Washu.

Washu:  I know.  That's what worries me.

{Flashback to TM!iL.  Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka stand on the observation deck of the Tokyo
Tower.  A bright light surrounds them as an item on each glows gold:  Tenchi's bracer, Ryoko's
neckplate, Ayeka's waistband.  From each, a golden disk emerges and passes of their bodies
changing their clothes into their individual battlesuits.}

Washu:  The battlesuit generators I gave to Ryoko, Tenchi, and you Ayeka are all essentially 
	the same.  They create a suit of thin cloth-like armor based upon your natural powers.
	That's why each looks different depending on the individual wearer.

{Return to present day.}

Ayeka:  {Concerned.}  Are you saying that creature probably has powers like Ryoko?

Washu:  I'm saying that thing has the powers of Ryoko.  I also have powers like Ryoko, like
	telepathy.  I can tell when someone uses Ryoan powers, and that thing has them without a
	doubt.

Ayeka:  What does that mean?

Washu:  I think someone's taking advantage of that bug's attack.  Given that the creature is
	designed similar to the bug, it's probably an organic weapon of some kind, obviously with
	great power.

L:  The way you two talk, it's like you've been up against strong enemies before.

Ayeka:  {Nods and sighs.}  A few...

L:  {Smiles a little.}  I guess that rules out you all being invaders from space.

Ayeka:  {Shakes her head.}  Of course not.  We have been living on Earth for the past two years.
	This planet has become our home.

Washu:  Especially when the former crown prince of Jurai and his grandson lives with us.
	{Smiles to herself.}

{Ayeka blushes while L teardrops.}

L:  {Shocked.}  Another alien prince on Earth?!

Washu:  Learn something new everyday.

{L sighs as the trio arrives at a McDonald's restaurant and stand outside the door.}

L:  I'll run in and grab the food.  What should we get for everyone?

Ayeka:  Do they have any soups?

L:  {Shakes her head.}  No, but if you're looking for something without grease, a salad sounds
	about right.

Ayeka:  Alright, a salad then.

Washu:  Get me some hash browns and coffee.

L:  Kay, I'll get a muffin and coffee...  {Thinks.}  J'll have the same...  What about Ryoko
	and her ship?

Washu:  {Sarcastically.}  Get another salad, heavy on carrots and a hamburger, rare.

L:  {Teardrop.}  I'll see what I can do...

{L swings into the restaurant while Ayeka and Washu stand waiting together.}

Ayeka:  You said that the creature could be taking advantage of the bug's attack on Manhattan
	for some reason.  Do you have any idea why?

Washu:  {Shakes her head.}  The galaxy left with the Arquillian ship.  There's a Salaxian ship
	in orbit from Salaxium 9, but they're of no real importance.  Most people know that you
	Juraian royals are here so it could be some remains for Kagato's faction, but I doubt it.

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  When Kagato fell, all of his followers turned themselves and their contacts in
	so it is unlikely to be related to him.  Also, Grandfather and I both left the throne of
	Jurai by our own accord.  It is doubtful that Kagato's former followers would come after
	us.

Washu:  {Nods.}  Right.  {Thinks.}  This is almost like a weapon trial.  Earth has minimal
	planetary defense and little knowledge of other planets and their politics.  If I were to
	test a weapon, this would be an ideal site.  This planet is, after all, the middle of
	nowhere.

Ayeka:  {Looks down to Washu.}  You think the creature is a manufactured bioweapon?

Washu:  {Nods.}  Yes, all that we know points to that.  However, the target is still a mystery.
	It's not after the Jurai Royal Family because if it was, it would have landed in Japan,
	not the United States.

Ayeka:  {Thinks.}  Could it have been sent for the Men in Black?

Washu:  Maybe...

{L exits the restaurant holding a couple large sacks filled with food while Ayeka and Washu are
pondering this idea.}

L:  {Straining.}  Well, I got the food...!!

Washu:  Well, then.  I guess we'd better finish our conversation back at the motel.

Ayeka:  {Nods.}  Agreed.

{Suddenly, a tanned and flaxen woman in a GP uniform runs up to the group and stops with them
out of breath.  Ayeka and Washu look at her an immediately recognize her.}

Ayeka & Washu:  {Surprised.}  Mihoshi...?

Mihoshi:  {Gasping.}  Yeah...!  I found you...!

Washu:  {Looks around.}  Where's Kiyone?

{Mihoshi calms down and takes a moment to gather her breath before she answers.}

Mihoshi:  She's landing Yagami outside of town so it wouldn't be noticed.

Ayeka:  {Smiles some.}  Kiyone knows the Galaxy Police procedures well enough, as always.

L:  {Teardrop.}  She's a Galaxy Police officer?  {Points to Mihoshi.}  This reject from a
	California beach?

{Mihoshi starts to fume while Ayeka and Washu teardrop.}

Mihoshi:  I'll have you know that I have tracked down some of the most dangerous criminals in
	the universe and brought them to justice, and I'm not just saying that to impress you
	because you just don't know what hardships I had to go through to do all that, but I
	still have that "death or glory spirit" that I always do!

L:  {Teardrop.}  Uh... criminals... like who?

Mihoshi:  {Thinks while counting on her fingers.}  Ryoko... Amarubei and Yura... Kagato...
	Kain...

L:  {Looks to Washu.}  She telling the truth?

Washu:  {Smiling wryly.}  Yeah... Ryoko "surrendered" to her...  She and her partner Kiyone
	arrested Amarubei and Yura... They helped us in the coup against Kagato and Kain...
	Kiyone even was the one that killed Kain.

L:  {Surprised.}  I'm impressed...!

Mihoshi:  {Smiles brightly.}  Thanks!

Ayeka:  Well, Mihoshi, how did you and Kiyone know to come here for us?

Mihoshi:  Oh, Tenchi and Sasami told us all about you all coming here on our way here.

Ayeka:  {Shocked.}  You mean Tenchi and Sasami came to America with you?!

Mihoshi:  {Nods.}  That's right, Ayeka.  {Smiles.}

{As Ayeka's voice and worry rise, Mihoshi cringes under Ayeka's yells.}

Ayeka:  {Worried.}  How could you do that, Mihoshi?!  Tenchi is still recovering from our fight
	with Kain!  Sasami has no business here!

Washu:  It's alright, Ayeka.  If Tenchi and Sasami are on Yagami, they'll be fine.

Ayeka:  {Determined.}  Take us to Yagami, Mihoshi.  I want to be sure Tenchi and Sasami are
	alright myself.

{Mihoshi straightens up a little now that Ayeka's starting to ease off.}

Mihoshi:  {Curious.}  Uh... okay, Ayeka, but where's Ryoko?

Washu:  She's at a motel nearby.  We'll pick her up on the way back.

L:  What about breakfast?  {Indicates the bags.}

Washu:  {Calmly.}  Oh yeah!  What would you like, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi:  {Thinks.}  A chocolate milk and a...

{As Washu gets Mihoshi's order followed by Tenchi, Sasami, and Kiyone's, L teardrops and sighs
hard.  The image changes to that of a monitor's view of the same scene.  Looking at the scene
from the shadows is a female with a left mechanical arm in contrast to her human right arm.
She leans forward to reveal the scars on the left side of her face and her fire-red hair.  Her
rage-filled eyes look on at this scene indifferently as the camera pans out to show her to be
Mitsuki wearing her GP uniform, a very different Mitsuki from two years ago.}

Mitsuki:  What is Mihoshi doing there?  {Looks to Ayeka and Washu.}  Hmm... they're here too...
	Well naturally, they're going to be here to stop me from taking Ryoko in.

{A subtle beep sounds as a light flashes before Mitsuki.  She presses the button and opens a
comm window before her with Zed's face.}

Zed:  Glad you decided to join us Officer Matsu.  I'm sorry to tell you, but Ryoko is no longer
	in our custody.

Mitsuki:  That's fine, Zed.  {Glances to the previous screen and then back to Zed.}  I already
	have a lead on her whereabouts along with where one of your lost agents is.

Zed:  {Rubs his chin.}  I suppose you've found either J or L.  They were chasing Ryoko and her
	companions last night.

Mitsuki:  Well, they definitely caught up with them.  I'll bring them all to you then.

Zed:  That's fine.  See you then.

{The comm window closes as Mitsuki looks back to the image of Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and L.
Mitsuki glares at them as the screen fades to black.}

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and L arrive at the motel.  L carries about four large bags packed with
food and is exhausted from carrying them.}

Washu:  {Looks at the aged motel.}  Well, at least Ryoko and J haven't destroyed the place.

Mihoshi:  J?

L:  My partner.

Mihoshi:  Oh.  {Smiles.}  You MiB agents have such simple names.

L:  {Teardrop.}  The job's complicated enough.  {Smiles wryly.}

Ayeka:  {Worried.}  How were Tenchi and Sasami when you left them, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi:  Well, they were playing Sasami's favorite fighting game.  {Giggles.}  Sasami was
	beating Tenchi.

Ayeka:  {Sighs.}  Good... then he's alright...

Mihoshi:  Don't worry so much, Ayeka.  You'll turn into a...  {Covers her mouth and stops.}

Ayeka:  {Glares some at Mihoshi.}  A what, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi:  {Teardrop.}  Oh nothing...!  {Smiles wryly.}

{Ayeka scoffs and turns from Mihoshi.  The click of a weapon's action is heard.  Everyone
freezes in their steps and looks over to see Mitsuki standing holding a GP blaster on them.}

Mihoshi:  Mitsuki...?

Mitsuki:  {Nods.}  Yeah, it's me.  Now, where are Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki?

L:  Hey, hold on a sec...!

Mitsuki:  {Aims at L.}  No, MiB.  We're not holding on anymore.  You've been wasting time with
	them when you should have been bringing them to me for transport to trial.

Ayeka:  Officer, this really is not the time nor place for a scene...

Mitsuki:  {Aims at Ayeka.}  Why not?  {Glares at Ayeka.}  You thought it a good time when you
	and your friends left my lover to die back in 1970.

Ayeka:  {Confused.}  What...?

Mitsuki:  That's right, Princess.  I personally hold you, Ryoko, and Tenchi Masaki responsible
	for the death of Operative A!  You all left him to die by Kain's hands while you were
	busy saving Tenchi's dear mother.

Ayeka:  {Confused.}  Wait... how could you know about what happened then?

Mitsuki:  I spent the past year as liaison to the MiB.  That gave me plenty of spare time to
	find a way into the classified files surrounding Kain's attack on the Galaxy Police
	headquarters.

{While Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and L are held at gunpoint by Mitsuki, Ryo-Ohki hops to a nearby
window and looks out.  Once she sees the situation, she meows in fear and runs over to Ryoko's
side.  She pushes against Ryoko's leg trying to wake her.  Ryoko's eyes start to open when Ryo-
Ohki starts to meow in desperation.  Simultaneously, J is awakened by Ryo-Ohki's cries.  Both
stand and wake themselves up until their eyes meet in a glare.  J raises his empty sidearm
while Ryoko summons her red power.  This second standoff holds while Ryo-Ohki explains the
situation outside to Ryoko telepathically.  Ryoko sees the scene outside through Ryo-Ohki's
thoughts and memories while still keeping a tight aim on J.  Ryoko nods to Ryo-Ohki and smiles
at the cabbit's kindness.  She dissipates her energy and calmly takes a mecha-Babelfish
translator and puts it in her ear.  J pulls the trigger on his weapon allowing it to discharge
nothing.  Ryoko turns back to J with a playful glare in her eyes while J looks oddly at his
weapon.}

Ryoko:  Looks like you're out of ammo, officer.  {Laughs to herself.}

{J drops his weapon and starts to pull a series 4 deatomizer when Ryoko raises her hand to him
again.}

Ryoko:  Look.  There's a rogue GP officer outside that's got everyone else held at gunpoint,
	including your partner.  We can go and deal with her, or I can blow your head into the
	next county.  I don't care either way.

J:  {Looks into Ryoko's eyes.}  I say we save my partner.  As for us, we'll finish this later.

Ryoko:  {Nods.}  Right.

{Ryoko and J both eye each other as Ryoko waits while J reloads his sidearm and also readies
his deatomizer holding the two weapons John Woo style.  Cut back to where Mitsuki has the
others held at gunpoint.  L's arms are starting to give way holding all the food from
McDonald's.  Washu's arms are folded while she awaits the next move.  Mihoshi stands confused
by Mitsuki's move while Ayeka looks into Mitsuki's eyes.}

Ayeka:  {Kindly.}  Officer Mitsuki, we are very sorry about Operative A, but by the time we got
	to the Tokyo Tower, he had already been killed by Kain.  There was not anything to do for
	him besides bury him, which we arranged under the Tokyo Tower's foundation.

{Tears of rage begin to stream down Mitsuki's face when Ayeka explains the truth.}

Mitsuki:  Stop lying, Ayeka!!  A's a survivor!!  He wouldn't have died against Kain!!

Washu:  Ayeka's right, Mitsuki.  I kept a constant scan on the area.  He went in alone and was
	killed soon after Kain appeared in that time period.

Mitsuki:  {Turns her weapon to Washu.}  You, Dr. Hakubi, should have found a way to save him!!
	You're a bloody genius, aren't you?!

Washu:  {Calmly.}  Operative A didn't act like he wanted to be saved.  He probably thought
	everyone at the Galaxy Police headquarters was killed when Kain escaped and wanted
	revenge for himself.

Mitsuki:  {Shakes her head.}  No!!  He would've known I got out alright!!

{The door to the motel room cracks a little.  Mihoshi notices it a little.  Mitsuki lowers her
weapon some closing her eyes in internal conflict.  Washu glances to the cracked door and
returns her gaze to Mitsuki formulating a plan.  Suddenly, Ryoko and J burst through the door
and train on Mitsuki.  Washu grabs Mihoshi and rushes into the motel room.  L drops her bags
and pulls her sidearm.  Ayeka turns to see the armed people behind her and jumps to the side
from them, leaving it to just Mitsuki against Ryoko, J, and L.  Mitsuki's eyes pop open as she
raises her blaster against to meet Ryoko's energy, J's sidearm and deatomizer, and L's sidearm.
Ayeka looks on from behind Ryoko, J, and L.}

L:  {Smiles a little.}  This fixes things a bit.  {To J.}  About time you woke up.

J:  Hey, I told you I'm a heavy sleeper, didn't I?

Mitsuki:  {Looks to Ryoko.}  Ryoko!

{Before Ryoko can respond, a balding, fat, New York slumlord runs between the two sides.}

Slumlord:  Hey!  Stop it!  Don't destroy my place!!

Ryoko:  {Scoffs.}  I'm not worried about destroying this place.

J:  Hell, blowing this place up would improve it!

{The slumlord's face goes to a cocky expression as he looks to Ryoko, J, and L.  His eyes flash
red, and Ryoko's mind registers a name which she speaks.}

Ryoko:  {Surprised and confused.}  Ryoko...?!

{Ryoko shoots into the sky and throws an energy pulse at the slumlord.  The pulse travels at
the unmoving and confident man.  It then ricochets off a shield about the man.  Everyone else
is shocked into awareness.  Ayeka raises her logs around the man while J, L, and Mitsuki aim at
him.  The man glares at Ayeka.}

Slumlord:  Princess Ayeka of Jurai, you can't hurt me.

{The man looks into Ayeka's eyes like looking into her very soul as his eyes flash a green.}

Slumlord:  I am the god.

{Ryoko and Ayeka are both stunned by the very words of Kagato from this man's lips as he throws
a Dark Jurai blast toward Ayeka, J, and L.  Ayeka quickly pulls her logs around herself and the
others and generates a shield and blocks the blast centimeters before J and L's faces.}

J:  {Surprised.}  What the hell?!

Ryoko:  {Yelling.}  Who are you?!  You're not Kagato!

Slumlord:  {Shakes his head.}  No, I'm not.  My name is Illirg, creation of Nerti Ro.

Mitsuki:  Nerti Ro?!  The Golden Goddess of Destruction?!

Illirg:  No, that's my sister, Mecha-Nerti.  {Scoffs.}  It looks like all of you have been
	infected with that vile human disease of ignorance.  {Laughs.}  I'll take pleasure in
	killing you all!!  {His eyes flash red again.}

{Within the motel room, Washu listens to all that is said and then creates her laptop.  She
brings up an image of Yagami not far away.  Mihoshi and Ryo-Ohki watch Washu curiously.  Washu
looks up to them.}

Mihoshi:  {Scared.}  What're we going to do, Washu?  That thing's really powerful...!

Washu:  {Seriously.}  First, we have to get out of here.  I can teleport us away to Yagami so
	Kiyone can attack it with Yagami's weapon systems.

{Ryo-Ohki meows sadly.}

Washu:  We'll get the others on the flyby, Ryo-Ohki.  Don't worry about it.  {Smiles.}

{Washu creates a gateway which herself, Mihoshi, and Ryo-Ohki run through.  Back outside with
the battle.  Ryoko hovers over Illirg holding energy in her hands.}

Ryoko:  {Scowls at Illirg.}  Bastard!!

{Ryoko hurls energy balls at Illirg.  Illirg stands there as each hits him and rips off a piece
of flesh reveiling his internal makeup to be that of an insect.}

J:  {Yells.}  Bug!!

{J and L fire their weapons and knock Illirg away past Mitsuki.  Illirg opens his skin disguise
and unfolds to his full height mantis form with Ryoko's colors.  He looks down at the others.}

Illirg:  Do you really want to face your better?  {Smiles.}

{J and L raise their weapons to fire again while Mitsuki stands there dumbfounded.}

J:  Mitsuki!  Move!!

{Illirg's face turns white as he raises his claws and summons red and black energy to his
hands.  Mitsuki looks at the black part of the power and is mesmerized.}

Mitsuki:  Kain...

{J and L run behind Ayeka as Ryoko drops behind her as well.  Ayeka generates a shield as
Illirg brings his arms down causing a great explosion that tosses Mitsuki into a wall knocking
her out and breaking Ayeka's shield sending all under it meters away.  J and L roll to their
feet while Ayeka picks herself up from the ground.  Ryoko catches herself in the air and flies
into the sky again.  Illirg's face returns to red and black as he tosses energy pulses at
everyone.  J and L jump into the motel room while Ryoko flies directly at Illirg with her
energy sword slicing all energy pulses aimed for her and Ayeka into oblivion.}

Ryoko:  Damn you, Kagato!!

{Illirg tosses one large blast directly for Ryoko.  She teleports next to Ayeka.  Illirg grins
to himself.}

Illirg:  You will die this time, Ryoko.

{The blast turns in the air and flies at Ryoko and Ayeka.  Ryoko and Ayeka scream as they
create their shield around them.  The two shields overlap and merge into one that the blast
hits.  The impact causes an energy reaction that blinds Illirg and dissipates his shield.  J
and L peer out from the motel room and fire on Illirg blasting him away from Ryoko and Ayeka.
The beast's blood falls to the ground around them all.  Ryoko and Ayeka look up surprised that
they are in one piece to see that Illirg tumbles backward and stands again quite angry.  His
face turns white again as he summons great power to his claws and launches a great blast of
mixed energy.  Ryoko flies from the impact site when Ayeka slips on the creatures green blood
at her feet.  Slow-motion:  The blast hits her left shoulder and sends her into a spin of pain
as she falls to the ground unconscious.  Real-time:  A male scream fills the air as a blue
blade  ricochets off Illirg's force shield.}

Voice:  AYEKA!!

{Tenchi lands next to Ayeka as Yagami pulls overhead and opens fire on Illirg with all weapons,
which do more damage to the structure from ricochets.  J and L roll out to Tenchi and Ayeka
while Ryoko quickly flies down and surrounds them with a shield.}

Ryoko:  {Looks at Tenchi.}  Tenchi!  What're you doing here?

Tenchi:  {Seriously.}  That doesn't matter, Ryoko.  Can you teleport us all to Yagami?

Ryoko:  {Nods.}  Yeah, no problem.

{Tenchi picks Ayeka up into his arms.  Ryoko looks at him with some surprise and concern.
Illirg pelts Ryoko's field with energy again as she holds it with difficulty.}

J:  What about ole Mitsy out there?!  {Points to Mitsuki surrounded by rubble.}

L:  We can't really get to her from here.

Ryoko:  {Glares at Mitsuki.}  Forget her.

{Ryoko releases her field just long enough to create a large gateway under their feet in which
they sink into and vanish.  Illirg looks up to Yagami and its weapons ricocheting off his
shield.  His anger becomes all the more evident as he yells causing a small earthquake.  He
summons energy to his hand and throws it into one of Yagami's engines destroying it.}

Illirg:  {Raging.}  No matter where you go, I WILL destroy you all!!  I will CLEANSE the
	universe of the curse known as TERRA for my creator's glory!!

{Illirg then moves his fire-filled eyes across the devastated landscape until he sights Mitsuki.
He glares at her as his frown twists into a sickening smile.}
