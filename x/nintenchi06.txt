would give away the story!


Last time on Ni    ntenchi!
It was a return to familiar ground for us as we headed to the Mushroom Kingdom. 
There, we were caught by Bowser and trapped in the BGNOs dungeon. Tenchi broke 
us out using the Lighthawk Wings (havenOt seen those in a while!) and fought an 
evil clone of Sakuya created by Bowser. Now, the greatest fight in Nintendo 
history is about to begin.

Episode 1:
The BGN: On The Attack!
(or: No Need for an All-Out War)

Chapter 1
The Stage is Set
(or: No Need for a M    elee)

	(Nintendia Prime: a bridge spanning a huge chasm with a tower in the 
distance.)
	The Warp Zone disappeared, and facing us was... the entire army of the 
BGN!!! Bowser stepped forward. OBwa-ha-ha-ha! Now that weOve all banded together 
the way we should, your pathetic force is no match for us! Prepare to face your 
doom!O Just then, Link, Mario, and Ash appeared. OAre you all right?O said Link. 
OSo you finally decided to show up...O taunted Ganondorf. OBring it on!O
	Then, a huge battle broke out. Sakuya was flinging fireballs all over the 
place, while Ash sent out his entire Pokemon force. Link chopped his way through 
the sea of Koopa Troopas while evading GanondorfOs attacks, and Mario kicked 
shells at the force. Even Tenchi and Ryoko got into it, using their energy 
abilities to fight off the BGNOs forces.
	Much later, empty Koopa shells were lying all over the place, and only the 
major fighters were left. OYouOre outnumbered 12 to 4. WhoOs pathetic now?O 
Ryoko said. OHmm... you seem to be stronger than   Å we thought. Butch, Cassidy, 
bring out the big guns. Ready, Ganondorf? LetOs power up!O instructed Bowser. 
Butch and Cassidy each pressed a button on a device, and Bowser and Ganondorf 
got a strange glow in their eyes. OI donOt like the look of this, Tenchi...O 
said Sakuya, now quite worried. OWe can beat them, no matter what they throw at 
us.O Tenchi reassured.
	There was a loud stomping noise, as a giant two-seated mecha fighter 
lumbered into view. Butch and Cassidy hopped in. And then... Bowser and 
Ganondorf changed into GIGA BOWSER and GANON!!! OTenchi!!!O Ayeka cried as she 
lept to shield Tenchi. OYouOll never get to him!O
	OOh no?O growled Giga Bowser. He thundered over to AyekaOs shield and 
poked it with one claw. The whole thing fizzled out. OAYEKA!O Sasami exclaimed.
Giga Bowser stepped back... it looked like he was about to use his flame 
breath... when suddenly...
	In a blaze of blue, Tenchi and Ayeka vanished! OWhat? What kind of 
trickery is this?O roared Giga Bowser. OItOs not trickery...O cam    e a voice 
from the blur. OItOs Sonic speed!O The blur stopped to reveal... OSONIC THE 
HEDGEHOG???!!!O


Chapter 2
Hog Those Hedges, Boys!
(or: No Need for Sonic, who belongs to Sega)
(there, I said it.)

	OSonic! Where are you?O came Miles OTailsO ProwerOs voice over the radio. 
OIOm just helping out some new friends. IOll be back in a flash!O answered 
Sonic. ONow as for you four... youOre going to need a lesson. See, itOs not 
always power that counts...O Bowser and Ganon readied their attacks. They 
launched them... and ended up hitting each other! O...Sometimes itOs speed!O 
finished Sonic. OGET THAT HEDGEHOG, BUTCH!!!O shouted Cassidy. ORight.O said 
Butch. He punched a button. OSupersonic jet boosters activated!O The mech 
suddenly began going faster and faster. It fired its weapon and... OZAP!O the 
weapon stopped Sonic in his tracks. OWhatOs going on? I canOt move!O cried 
Sonic.
	OSonic!O we all exclaimed. OThatOs it!O Sakuya challenged, stepping 
towards the enemies. OIOve watched enough! ILLUSION... POKE...     BALL... 
CRE...O Sakuya was promptly trampled by Butch and Cassidy.
	ONow that your little saviors are gone, nothing can stop us...O began Giga 
Bowser, when suddenly a large, egg-shaped ship loomed into view. OHuh? Oh no... 
Eggman! At a time like this?O cried Sonic, still trapped in place by Butch and 
CassidyOs gun. OHello, dear friends!O said Eggman (the villain formerly known as 
Dr. Robotnik.) OI see you have captured my old nemesis, Sonic the Hedgehog. Good 
for you. Now, I must see to it that he is destroyed as quickly as possible. So 
if you would kindly let me through...O EggmanOs ship moved closer to Sonic and a 
large cannon came out of the end. Then there was a surprising response to 
EggmanOs attempt.
	OOh no you donOt! HeOs ours!O The members of the BGN seemed to want to 
defeat Sonic themselves! OWhat?!O protested Eggman. OBut heOs MY rival. HeOs 
been all good-guy against me for 10 years now, and now that I have him just 
where I want him, this happens? Four wannabe supervillains come up and want to 
take     him down themselves? ItOs not fair!O
	OWannabe supervillains, huh?O said Ganon. OThatOs it!O And the BGN turned 
their backs on us and ganged up on Eggman.
	We all stared at each other and shrugged. Then we sat down to watch. 
Later, after it had gotten boring, Link got up and said, OThis is stupid.O He 
ran over to the fighting and rammed his sword straight through the mechaOs armor 
and into its fuel supply. He ran away just before the whole mess exploded.
	OWEORE BLASTING OFF AGAIN!!!O cried the five bad guys.

Chapter 3:
SonicOs Story
(or: No Need for Dreamcast)

	After the fight was over and we freed Sonic, we were all heading back to 
the main tower. OSonic,O asked Link. OHow is it you came to Nintendia, anyway?O 
OWell, thatOs a really good story. You see, one day I was running around, doing 
what I usually do, when I noticed something shining in a river. I dug it out and 
it turned out to be one of the seven Chaos Emeralds! So I took it along with me, 
and went back home to play my trusty Dreamcast. Well, wou    ldnOt you know it, 
the Chaos Emerald somehow reacted to the Dreamcast, and now IOm here! Which was 
pretty convenient considering what just happened to you. If I hadnOt been there, 
youOd have been toast.O Sonic explained. ONow thereOs one problem, though. How 
do I get back?O I took out my NINTENDO. 
	OOh, thatOs easy. IOll just push this button and...O 
I pushed the button. 
Nothing seemed to happen. 
ODid that do anything?O asked Tenchi. OYeah. ItOs just impossible to tell unless 
you go up in space. Now letOs do something else!O I pushed another button and a 
giant ring appeared in the air. OJust wanted to make an appropriate warp...O I 
said. Sonic jumped in and disappeared. OAnyway,O said Sakuya, Owhere will we go 
next?O ORight where he went!O I said, re-pressed the button, and we all jumped 
in.

Chapter 4:
GUN Shy
(or: No Need for a Military Capture)

	We materialized in a huge room with lots of computers. OWhere are we? It 
looks like some sort of base... but for what?O said Ryoko, floating around the 
room i    nspecting things. Mihoshi opened a door... and an alarm went off!
	OMihoshi! WeOre in trouble!O cried Kiyone. OYouOre right, you are.O came a 
voice through a megaphone. We were surrounded by the military! OYou donOt 
under...O
	Ostand.O We had been locked up in a prison. OHow did I ever get into this 
mess...O said Tenchi. OThey donOt KNOW IOm Grand Overseer? Why canOt news travel 
as fast as Sonic?O I complained.
	OHey, did somebody call me?O Sonic came down the hall. OSonic! YouOre 
here!O Sonic used an access   - card to free us and we left.
	OThatOs two you owe me.O said Sonic. OLetOs get going!O I said, running 
off to explore.
