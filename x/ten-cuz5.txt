		TENCHI'S COUSIN - Chapter 5


	Fade in to a set of interlude scenes covering the next few 
months - typical Masaki residence craziness, with KENJI added. 
Individual scenes include, but are not limited to:
	-KENJI and YOUSHO training with bokken and studying old books, 
and also talking to AYEKA's Guardians, AZAKA and KAMIDAKE, from time 
to time...
	-KENJI and AYEKA arguing, while RYOKO looks on, not sure 
whether to join the fun, laugh, or complain...
	-TENCHI and KENJI reminiscing about old times in the onsen, 
and KENJI showing his cousin some martial arts moves he's seen,
describing them with much waving of arms. RYOKO is watching from 
the upper pool (Where TENCHI was in OAV 8), with a beatific smile 
on her face. AYEKA walks in, KENJI notices RYOKO, and a battle erupts 
as soon as the Masaki boys find their towels...
	-RYOKO and KENJI sparring again, with AYEKA looking on, rooting
for KENJI - except when she accidentally cheers for RYOKO. Both 
fighters stop and stare at her, and she turns red and runs off. KENJI
and RYOKO sweatdrop...
	-YOUSHO and KENJI again, this time with blades of Jurai Power,
fencing. KENJI gets bopped again, and backs off for a second, then 
closes his hands around the ends of his blade and concentrates. The
blade doubles in length, and KENJI attacks, holding it like a staff.
YOUSHO is so taken aback that *he* gets bopped for once, and KENJI 
immediately cheers in triumph and runs off with his grandfather in
pursuit...
	-RYOKO and KENJI, seated on the edge of the roof, talking 
quietly...
	-KENJI 'getting aquainted' with MIHOSHI (i.e. falling victim to
various calamities...)
	-TENCHI trying to escape RYOKO's advances, while KENJI watches
with a - jealous?- look on his face...
	-Baby Taro's second visit, and KENJI sweatdropping as he 
watches WASHU-CHAN tend the baby...
	-WASHU enticing a wary KENJI into her lab, and the door closing
behind them. Shortly thereafter, there are assorted crashings and 
booms from the lab, and everyone gathers by the door to see what the fuss
is.
The next scene is a smoldering KENJI diving out the door followed by
explosions and reaching metal tendrils. He storms off, and WASHU 
sticks her head out the door - she's singed, too - and sweatdropping 
at the looks she gets...
	-KENJI helping TENCHI in the fields, and slicing vegetables 
for SASAMI in the kitchen while laughing as she strikes a Sailor Moon
(Pretty Sammi?) pose...
	-KENJI, RYOKO, and RYO-OHKI (in humanoid form) playing on the
hillside...
	Finally, the flashes segue into a scene in the living room of 
the Masaki house. TENCHI and KENJI are on the 'indoors' side of the
room, SASAMI is standing by the door to the kitchen, and by the 
(window door) to the outside, AYEKA and RYOKO are glaring at each 
other.

		AYEKA
	FURIOUS How dare you, Ryoko! You know very well that 
Tenchi-sama is not well suited to your advances! How many times must 
I tell you to leave him in peace!

		RYOKO
	ANNOYED That's not _your_ decision to make, little princess! 
I'll stay near Tenchi as long as I bloody well feel like it! Besides, 
he may turn that cute shade of red, but I haven't heard *him* complain...

		TENCHI
	RESIGNED (sighs) Oh well... I hope Washu's in a better mood 
than she was after you trashed her machines, because we're gonna 
need her to fix up the house later.

		KENJI
	FLAT VOICE Oh look, now they're in the 'glare of sparks' stage.
MORE NORMAL Don't they ever get tired of this? I mean, this _has_ to 
get old sometime...

		NOBIYUKI
	ENTERING ROOM Oh, hello girls-

	Both AYEKA and RYOKO glare at him, firey auras appearing to
backlight them.

		NOBIYUKI
	SWEATDROPS Nevermind... Sasami, how's lunch coming?

	NOBIYUKI, back to the wall, edges around the two girls, who 
have gone back to giving each other the 'Stare of Death.' SASAMI 
wrings her hands.

		SASAMI
	Oneesan, Ryoko-neechan, _please_ don't fight - lunch is
almost ready...

	Her voice trails off as she realizes that neither one is
paying her any attention. TENCHI groans.

		TENCHI
	Here goes the house...

	KENJI suddenly looks from his position, to RYOKO, to the 
outside door, and nods.

		KENJI
	Sasami, could you open the outside door, please? TO TENCHI, 
SOFT When I get Ryoko, you talk to Ayeka, okay?

		TENCHI
	What?!? What am I supposed to tell her? What do you-

KENJI cuts him off.

		KENJI
	Just keep her from chasing Ryoko and me outside, alright?

		TENCHI
	TOTALLY CONFUSED Outside!? What are you going to-

	SASAMI has quietly opened the outside door, and KENJI springs 
into action. He leaps at RYOKO, catching her totally offguard and
grabbing her around the waist.

		KENJI
	WILD EXCITEMENT *TAG!* *You're* it!!

	His leap carries RYOKO out the door before she quite knows 
what's going on, and he 'tags' her by smacking her on her bottom. Her
anger turns to outrage and - a hint of a playful expression? - before
she lunges at Kenji, who races away toward the shrine hill as fast as 
he can run. TENCHI recovers from the collective shock first.

		TENCHI 
	MURMURS Ayeka. Talk to Ayeka. Right! TO AYEKA, ALOUD Uh..
nice weather we're having, isn't it? I mean, the trees are so pretty
in autumn.

	AYEKA suddenly realizes both that she is being addressed and 
also *who* is addressing her, and spins around to face TENCHI.

		AYEKA
	Oh! Pardon my inattention! I.. I suppose you're right, Tenchi. 
SLY GLANCE Oh my... whatever could possess you to bring up this 
subject now?

	TENCHI, realizing he's wandered into a minefield by getting 
even the least bit romantic, begins to sweat heavily. WASHU comes out 
of her lab at this point, getting everyone's attention (much to 
TENCHI's relief.)

		WASHU
	All over already? No mass destruction, no torn-down walls? My,
what a quiet argument. PAUSES Well, I suppose it's for the best. I've
picked up a Juraian ship headed insystem, so we'd better be ready for
guests.

		AYEKA
	A *Juraian* ship? But Father forbade most access to the Earth
system, to prevent me being sought out. Has the ship been challenged? 
Is it the Royal craft?

		WASHU
	No, to both your questions. The Yagami has appeared to let it
pass, and it's a vessel of the same class as your Ryu-Oh.

		AYEKA
	SOFTLY Oh no. The only ship it can be is Ryu-Kii.

		TENCHI
	Ryu-Kii?

		AYEKA
	Seiryuu's ship.

		TENCHI
	Seiryuu? Oh, right, that guy your dad wanted you.. to... Um,
Ayeka? Does this mean he's here to challenge me for your 'hand in
marriage' again?

		AYEKA
	Not precisely. If that were the case, the Royal ship would be
coming as well, for such duels must be witnessed by the royal family,
and Father would never trust me to report that Seiryuu defeated you.
It's more likely that he's coming to... ah...

		TENCHI
	WORRIED FOR HER To what?!?

		AYEKA
	HANGS HEAD To take revenge for his prior defeat. This is 
frowned upon in Juraian society, but it is done from time to time. 
If his family were sufficiently ashamed of his defeat - technically, 
at your hands, since he was in combat with you at the time - they 
could have disowned him until he atones for that sin. It's both 
better and worse than a formal duel, since I'm not obliged to stand 
by and watch unless you ask me to, but he's not obliged to leave his
servants out of it either. We should prepare for the worst!

		TENCHI
	Oh, no! Kenji and Ryoko!

	Everyone turns to look out the window. KENJI and RYOKO are 
nowhere in sight.

	The scene shifts to the bridge of a Juraian ship (Ryu-Kii) 
where SEIRYUU is addressing two servants in black versions of 
Juraian 'knight' outfits (that look vaguely similar to black versions 
of TENCHI's Light Hawk Armour getup) and two Guardians, like AYEKA's 
but slimmer and of a darker wood.

		SEIRYUU
	Do you have it yet?

		GUARDIAN 1
	There are two sources of high-energy emissions in the forested
area behind the hill. One life-form occupies the mountaintop. All 
others are concentrated in the household.

		SEIRYUU
	Ah! Good work, Shikino! The energy sources must be Princess 
Ayeka and Ryoko having one of their interminable arguments. The one 
in the mountaintop will be Lord Yousho, and the others are in the 
house. Excellent! CALLS TO SHIP Ryu-Kii! Isolate the shrine with a
forcefield and transport Tetta and Tessei down to occupy the 
princess and the pirate. TO BLACK KNIGHTS Tetta, Tessei, I don't 
care if the pirate lives or dies, but you will bring Princess Ayeka 
to the Ryu-Kii and prevent anyone else you find there from 
interfering with my revenge on that young barbarian. Shikino, 
Kudano, come with me and hold the others at bay. Let's go!

	The two Black Knights, TETTA and TESSEI, heft their somewhat
twisted Juraian staffs and smile in a predatory fashion. Their skin 
tone is darker than most Juraians', and TETTA is of average build 
with a black beard, while TESSEI is vaguely elfin, with slanted eyes 
and a slim build. (Yes, they're Kagato's Knights from the TV series.)
SHIKINO (Guardian 1) and KUDANO (Guardian 2) move to flank SEIRYUU 
and they all disappear in beams of light. The scene fades from here 
to the forested hillside where RYOKO and KENJI had their first fight.
RYOKO and KENJI are there, sitting on the grass panting, quite close
together.

		RYOKO
	I can't believe you did that! Yanking me right out from in 
front of Ayeka and smacking me on the bottom like that! What in the
world brought that on?!

		KENJI
	GRINS Hey, you would've trashed the house! And since my- 
ahem- 'dispute' with Washu put her in a snit, who knows how long it
would've taken to fix it! This way, you got to relieve your stress, 
I got a workout, and the house is intact. Everybody wins!

		RYOKO
	You gotta be kidding! I- 

	As RYOKO cuts off her speech, she begins darting her gaze 
around, finally noticing two beams of light as they appear, and 
shadows grow within them, resolving into TETTA and TESSEI.

		KENJI
	Nice entrance. Somebody who likes 'Star Trek?'

		RYOKO
	ANGRY, ALARMED Kenji, they're renegade Juraians! Ones who
experimented with forbidden aspects of Jurai Power!

	RYOKO and KENJI flip to their feet and take combat stances. 
RYOKO morphs into her fighting gear, KENJI manifests his Jurai Power
staff, and TETTA and TESSEI take up guard positions. TESSEI looks 
around for a moment, then turns back to RYOKO and KENJI.

		TESSEI
	Where is Ayeka-hime?

		KENJI
	If you'll tell me why you're here, you'd have more chance of
getting that information...

	TESSEI looks at TETTA, who shrugs.

		TESSEI
	We are serving one Seiryuu, at present. He wishes us to conduct
Ayeka-hime to his ship.

		RYOKO
	Let me guess. Her wishes aren't exactly a problem?

		TESSEI
	Not in the least. Any others who stand in our way, well...

		TETTA
	Tessei, she ain't here. Let's just git to the house.

		KENJI
	You gotta go through *us* to do that. Iku-yo, (Let's go,) 
Ryoko!

	KENJI and RYOKO square off against TETTA and TESSEI, 
respectively. RYOKO begins the battle with a rapid volley of energy
bolts that TESSEI either dodges or swats away with his staff, and 
the two of them move off quickly toward the forest. TETTA spins his
staff, the orb in the end beginning to glow, and fires a shockwave 
at KENJI. Kenji avoids it by going airborne, and grins.

		KENJI
	Missed! Take this! ROKU-REPPA! (note: Six Waves)

	KENJI swings his staff crosswise, and six bolts of blue
energy streak out from it toward TETTA, who smirks.

		TETTA
	Piece o' cake! SPINS HIS STAFF

	As KENJI's energy bolts reach the circle marked by TETTA's
spinning staff, they are whirled onto it and spin in circles. As 
they spin, they turn from bright blue to dark gray (almost black) 
and double in size before spiralling off TETTA's staff back toward
KENJI, who has just landed.

		KENJI
	WHISPERED Holy shit!.. SHIN-KI-KO-SHO!

	KENJI's massive counterblast stops (and destroys) the black 
bolts, but he's let his staff dissipate to do it, and gets slammed
across the hillside and into a tree trunk when TETTA follows up his
attack by leaping in and smahing his staff into KENJI in a crosswise
blow. KENJI rolls to his feet and takes up a guard stance as TETTA
charges in. TETTA tries an overhand swing of his staff, and KENJI 
grabs it with both hands, grinning.

		KENJI
	Gotcha! Now- AAAAA!!

	TETTA has just run dark lightning across his staff, shocking
KENJI, who writhes for a moment before being thrown off and flying 
down the hill. He hits, tumbles, rolls, and finally comes to a stop 
at the base of the hill. He spits blood and dirt as TETTA bounds 
downhill at him.

		KENJI
	UNDERTONE Ok, Juraian fighting arts are getting me nowhere 
fast. Time to go back to basics - and on that note...

	TETTA arrives, leaping down at KENJI with another overhand 
swing, but gets stopped in his tracks by about twenty blows from the
Lightning Kick. KENJI finishes his combo with a roundhouse kick that
sends TETTA into a tree trunk.

		TETTA
	GETTING UP Ok, that's not bad- GASPS

	KENJI is airborne and inbound, hands cupped to one side as he
flies in at TETTA.

		KENJI
	SHIN-KI-KO-SHO!!!!

	TETTA throws up a forcefield in desperation, and growls in 
effort as the blue energy pounds at it from all sides. He grins 
tightly at KENJI as the globe dies down, then gets a puzzled look on 
his face as KENJI retreats around the tree.

		TETTA
	Huh? Come on, kid, y' can't hide forever!

		KENJI
	SMUG Who says I'm hiding? HYAA!!

	TETTA's face shows pure terror as KENJI's leaping roundhouse 
kick hits the tree just above the area weakened by the Kikosho, and 
the three-foot-wide trunk topples towards the Juraian renegade.
Instinctively he leaps back, but only gets caught in the foliage.
The fallen branches thrash for a few moments, then TETTA's head emerges 
from the leaves.

		TETTA
	Trashed by a tree - and I ain't even on Jurai! This is so-

	KENJI cuts him off midsentence by mimicking TETTA's earlier 
leap-in-from-overhead attack, gripping his remanifested staff by one 
end to add more force to the blow. TETTA, nailed in the back of the 
head, shuts up and passes out. KENJI picks up TETTA's staff gingerly,
and when nothing shocks him, he snaps it in half over his knee.

		KENJI
	Huh. Jerk. You gotta keep the battlefield in mind, or it'll 
come back and bite you!

		RYOKO (O.S.)
	Ahhhh!

		KENJI
	*RYOKO!* Hang on!

	KENJI bolts into the woods, in the direction of RYOKO's scream. 
In a few seconds, he's reached the scene of the battle between RYOKO 
and TESSEI. RYOKO is lying on the ground several yards away from 
TESSEI, bleeding from a large number of narrow cuts and thin 
punctures. KENJI runs in between RYOKO and the Juraian renegade,
bringing a swordblade into being in one hand.

		KENJI
	GRIM VOICE You hurt her. I'm going to give you one chance to 
leave with your health intact. If you don't take it... GROWLS *It's*
*your* *funeral.* Go!

		TESSEI
	QUIET, AMUSED So far, I see no reason I should leave. So why 
don't you give me one?

	KENJI doesn't waste his breath on another warning: he attacks.
Grasping the sword in bothe hands and turning it into his staff, he
dashes in and swings it in much the same way as he knocked out 
TETTA. TESSEI extends one rigid arm, holding his staff in a 
horizontal block, and KENJI is stopped cold. KENJI's expression 
shows mild interest.

		KENJI
	Huh! Tetsu-Shisei!

		TESSEI
	PUZZLED I don't believe I'm familiar with that term...

		KENJI
	It's the Earth name for your defensive technique. You stand 
rigid and don't yield to force: the name means "Iron Stance."

		TESSEI
	Ah. GRINS We call it Unyielding Branch, for the trees of Jurai. 
It is good to fight a *warrior* instead of (LOOKS AT RYOKO) a 
flailing savage.

		KENJI
	SEETHING Kono.. (You..)

	KENJI rebounds away from TESSEI's block and comes around with 
a roundhouse swing of his staff, but TESSEI is waiting with a 
vertical block - again, using the Unyielding Branch to stop KENJI's
swing one-handed. TESSEI's grin becomes superior, and KENJI bounds 
away to try an energy blast. TESSEI, who's evidently been waiting 
for this, spins his staff in a circle once before slamming its 
pointed end into the ground. KENJI sees the resulting shockwave 
heading his way, and tries one of YOUSHO's defensive techniques: he
throws one arm out with the hand cocked as if to say 'stop', 
creating a forcefield between him and TESSEI. RYOKO, who has looked 
up from the ground to watch, cries out in alarm.

		RYOKO
	Kenji, *NO!* Not a forcefield, it won't-

	KENJI braces as if to face a strong wind, and the shockwave 
pounds against his field without penetrating. However, he cries out 
in pain a second later as several narrow cuts open up in his clothes 
and skin. The cuts are a lot like the ones RYOKO currently sports.

		KENJI
	*Ahh!* What the-

	KENJI is cut off as TESSEI begins the swinging motion once 
again. The action goes into slow motion as KENJI frantically tries 
to figure out this attack.

		KENJI (V.O.)
	Okay, somehow that attack drives pinpoint blasts through
forcefields. Total defense isn't an option: let's try counterattack.
(END V.O., ACTION SPEEDS UP TO NORMAL) SHIN-KI-KO-SHO!

	KENJI's signature blast roars out once again: this time, 
however, it's less than successful. As the shockwave hits it, the
fifteen-foot energy globe *ripples* along its front up to a height 
of about six feet, and small streaks are visible penetrating the 
blast and going past - or through - KENJI in his attack stance. As 
the Kikosho fades, KENJI slumps to his knees. Several new cuts have
opened up, and one small hole is visible in KENJI's left thigh. It
begins to bleed.

		KENJI (V.O.)
	Owww... oh, I get it now. That's a nice trick. The shockwave
weakens whatever defense it's sent against, and the little 
force-bolts can go right in through it. The wave probably speeds up 
the little bolts, too, but they're probably randomly placed, or he'd
have done more damage on the first attack. ALOUD Th.. (COUGHS) That's 
a good technique.

		TESSEI
	VERY SMUG It's Jurai's Needle. It was forbidden centuries ago 
on Jurai because it's a technique that kills your foe slowly. It's
obviously beyond your skills, so I'll finish this battle now.

	KENJI, thinking frantically, replays the two uses of Jurai's
Needle he's seen in his mind, trying to find a way to win. TESSEI 
begins to laugh as he slowly winds up for a third attack. Suddenly, 
KENJI's head snaps up.

		KENJI
	*THAT'S IT!*

	TESSEI throws another Jurai's Needle, laughing, but it's KENJI 
who has the smirk on his face now. At the last second, KENJI leaps 
up, going airborne and evading the attack entirely as it passes 
beneath him. His staff is already in his hands, and he swings it in 
a vicious arc.

		KENJI
	*ROKU-REPPA!*

	TESSEI is caught flatfooted by the six energy bolts arcing in 
at him and is blown several yards, bouncing off two trees in the 
process. KENJI lands, but drops to one knee in anguish as he clutches 
his injured leg. Glancing back, he notices he's directly in line 
between TESSEI and RYOKO again. TESSEI climbs to his feet with a look 
of rage on his face, and aims his staff at KENJI (and beyond him,
RYOKO.) The orb at the end of the staff begins to seethe with energy.

		TESSEI
	NOW - YOU - DIE!!

		RYOKO
	Kenji, run! Jump! Get away!

		KENJI
	I *won't!* I won't leave you to die!

	TESSEI releases a storm of energy from his staff, and KENJI 
throws out his hand in YOUSHO's forcefield defence again. When the 
storm of black lightning fades, KENJI is flat on his back. TESSEI's
staff begins to seethe with energy again. RYOKO is trying to get up, 
and KENJI struggles to a kneeling position facing TESSEI.

		TESSEI
	QUIET ANGER This is the end.

	RYOKO tries to charge an energy blast, but it fizzles. KENJI
struggles to his feet, with an odd look on his face - equal parts
dignity and determination. TESSEI unleashes another energy blast, 
which engulfs KENJI. Oddly, it grinds to a halt before reaching 
RYOKO, as if there is an obstacle in the middle of it. RYOKO screams 
as the dust begins to settle.

		RYOKO
	*NOOOOO!!*

		KENJI (V.O.)
	CALM It's all right, Ryoko. I'm fine.

		TESSEI
	Impossible! My first attack broke through your forcefield,
why would the second fail-

	TESSEI stops almost midword as the dust begins to clear enough 
to see. There is a humanoid figure flanked by two Light Hawk Wings 
standing in the dust cloud. RYOKO, seeing this, is elated.

		RYOKO
	TENCHI! You saved him, thank you, thank you -  STOPS IN 
AMAZEMENT

		KENJI
	I may not be my cousin, but will I do?

	The dust has cleared. KENJI is standing there, flanked by the 
two Wings of the Light Hawk. His outfit is a mess, but his skin 
shows none of the wounds inflicted earlier. RYOKO gawks unashamedly, 
as the ripped shirt and pants give her the best view she's had of 
KENJI since the onsen incident. Realizing this, KENJI blushes. Then 
TESSEI snarls, and KENJI's face darkens.

		KENJI
	Are you *still* there? I warned you once, now I'm _telling_ 
you; Go. Now. Or I *will* cripple you. TURNS TO RYOKO Hey, Ryoko, 
you okay?

	TESSEI brings his staff to bear as KENJI turns his back. KENJI 
whirls and lunges, the Light Hawk Wings becoming swords as he goes.
There is a flash as TESSEI tries to block with his staff. When the 
light clears, TESSEI's staff is on the ground in three neatly 
chopped pieces, and KENJI has buried the Light Hawk Swords into 
TESSEI's shoulders. TESSEI's arms go limp as the joints are ruined 
by the double thrust. KENJI coolly pulls the swords out and spins,
chopping one sword into TESSEI's hip. TESSEI collapses, and KENJI 
turns back to RYOKO again, the Light Hawk Wings fading out.

		KENJI
	CONCERNED Ryoko? You didn't answer - you all right? You're not
badly hurt, are you?

		RYOKO
	GRINS Nah, I'm just exhausted. Give me a few minutes to rest, 
and I'll be as healed as you are. GRIN WIDENS

		KENJI
	Huh? As I am- NOTICES -oh. That's a neat trick! I'll have to
remember that one. Why the grin, though?

		RYOKO
	Well, you know how Mom is about Tenchi and that 'sample...'

		KENJI
	Yeah, I know. She tried to truss *me* up that one time, 
remember? But she's after Tenchi more than me- PAUSES -uh oh.

		RYOKO
	You got it! It's the Wings of the Light Hawk she's interested 
in, and now that you've shown you can access them too...

		KENJI
	GROANS Aw, *man*...

	RYOKO laughs. KENJI hangs his head in despair for a few 
seconds, then snaps it back up to look at RYOKO.

		KENJI
	ALARMED Hold it! Ryoko, how likely is it that those two were 
here alone!?

		RYOKO
	Uh... not very likely at all, come to think of it. SUDDEN 
ALARM *TENCHI!* Oh no, we've got to get back to the house!

	RYOKO teleports, and KENJI begins leaping from tree to tree 
to get around the mountain faster.

			END CHAPTER 5

Hee Hee! Sorry about the cliffhanger, folks, but this part was 
long enough already! See you next Chapter!
