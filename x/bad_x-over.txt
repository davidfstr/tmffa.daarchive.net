A Really Bad X-Over Idea.

__________________________________________________________

              It was your average Saturday at the Masaki house. . .
Well, sort of.  Sasami was cooking lunch, Yosho was at the shrine,
Washu was in her laboratory, Tenchi was in the fields, in fact only one
thing was different.  Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki were nowhere to be seen.
              This had been going on for about a week now.  Washu
had sent Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki to another dimension for something.
Washu said that it may take about a week, considering what Ryoko was
doing, but she should be okay.  Trouble was, the house just did not seem
the same without Ryoko, and Ryo-oh-ki.  The mornings just did not seem
quite as bright, the air seemed a bit stale, and the entire day was
undoubtedly boring.  Sasami missed Ryo-oh-ki being around to help in
the kitchen, Tenchi even missed Ryoko hugging him every morning.
The house just was not complete without them.
              Surprisingly, the person who missed Ryoko the most
was Ayeka.  The princess noticed that things just were not right without
Ryoko.  She missed the daily arguments, the criticizing of the TV shows,
and mostly the competition for Tenchi.  Ayeka also realized that Tenchi
just was not ready for a relationship (Is this REALLY surprising to
anybody?), and that it was harder to express her feelings for the
earthling, without the incentive that Ryoko usually caused.  And yes, she
would admit it.  She longed for the friendship, abet a strange one, that
she shared with the pirate.
              "Oh, Ryoko." Ayeka sighed.  "Come home soon.  I do
not think that any of us can take this much longer."

##########################################################

              Washu sat in her lab, waiting for Ryoko to return.  It
had already been a week.  Certainly that would have been enough time to
find them all.  It was not like she asked her to bring them ALL back, just
the information, and a few specimens.
              Okay, so she did ask for all of their final forms, but
that would not have taken too long, either.
              Suddenly a beeper sounded on the main computer.
Washu rushed to the board and booted up the computer.
 *You’ve got mail!* sounded the computer.
 The message was of alternate dimensional origin.

[Washu,
                    ]
[Me and Ryo-oh-ki are coming back home.  Got them all.      ]
[
                           ]
[Ryoko.
                     ]

 Washu grinned.  She then began to type up the reply.

[Ryoko,
   ]
[Received your message.                                         ]
[The portal is at the appointed place, in Bill’s lab.  ]
[Come back soon.  We all miss you.                        ]
[
          ]
[Your mother, Washu.                                                 ]
[The Greatest Scientific Genus In The Universe.     ]

 Washu then sent the message.

##########################################################

4:00am  Sunday morning.

              A bluish-gray vortex opened up just in front of the
house.  Out of it dropped a cyan-hared woman, and a cat/rabbit.  Ryoko
was dressed in a orange jacket, blue jeans, high-top sneakers, and a
green baseball cap.  She was also wearing a T-shirt (sorry you perverts)
that read "I went on the SS Anne, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!",
but that was irrelevant considering that her jacket was zipped up.
              Ryoko looked to her left, and to her right, seemingly
looking for something.  "Hey, Ryo-oh-ki." Ryoko said.  "Where are the
bags?"
              Ryo-oh-ki was about to make a mental reply, but
decided it was unnecessary as said bags tumbled out of the portal, and
buried Ryoko.  The former pirate pulled herself out from under the sacks,
which were filled with many spherical objects, and glared at the two
dozen burdens.

              After pulling all of the bags into the house, Ryoko
collapsed on the floor, and leaned against the wall.
              "Whew!  Those things are heavy, even for me." said
Ryoko, to herself.
              Ryo-oh-ki bounded up to Ryoko.  "Miya, miya, miya?"
              "No, Ryo-oh-ki.  I didn’t forget."  Ryoko reached
behind her back, and pulled out a ball, like the ones that were in the
sacks.  In fact it was one of the balls that were in the sacks.  "Here."
She
tossed it to Ryo-oh-ki.
              The cabbit shifted to her humanoid child form, and
inspected the inscription on the ball.  Satisfied that it was her paw print,
she rushed off to the hallway.
              "What she sees in that creature, I’ll never know."
Ryoko muttered.  She then checked the clock in the living room.  "Four
thirty. . .  It’ll be a while before the others are up.  May as well go and
get some rest."
              Ryoko flew up to her perch in the rafters, and without
even bothering to change out of her clothing, fell asleep.

##########################################################

              Ayeka slowly made her way down the hallway.  She
had originally gotten up to get a glass of water, but changed her plans
when she noticed that Ryo-oh-ki was sleeping next to Sasami.  If Ryo-
oh-ki was home, then that meant that Ryoko was home as well.
              Why the cabbit was clutching a red and white ball,
Ayeka had no idea.
              She reached the living room, and looked up at Ryoko’s
usual perch.  Cyan hair, shapely body, sleeping soundly enough that wild
horses and atomic explosions could not disturb her slumber.  Yup, that
was Ryoko.
              Ayeka then noticed the large sacks piled up in a
corner.  Curious, she went over to the bags, and pulled out one of the
objects from them.  It was a ball, just like the one that Ryo-oh-ki was
clutching back in the bedroom.  The sphere was red on one side, and
white on the other.  Closer examination revealed that it had a button on
the side, where the two colors met.
              Ayeka was sure that if she pushed the button, whatever
was encased inside would be revealed.  She did not want to risk being
seen, sneaking around with what Ryoko had obviously brought home, but
Ayeka was not about to let the mystery of what was inside go
unanswered, either.  Ayeka carefully placed the ball in the sleeve of her
night robe, and quietly made her way out the side door.

              Ayeka went behind the house, and pulled the sphere
back out of her sleeve.  "Now to find out just what is inside of this
thing." Said Ayeka, as she pushed the button.  The ball began to shine
slightly, and it opened up to reveal

##########################################################

              Sasami opened her eyes.  She sat up, and looked
around.  It was rather early in the morning, and the sun was just coming
up.  The little princess looked next to her.  "Ryo-oh-ki?"
              The cabbit, upon hearing her name, also woke up.  She
then realized what time it was, and decided it was time to wake Ryoko
up.  Ryo-oh-ki grabbed the sphere she had been keeping, and amazingly
on two feet, rushed out the door.
              "Ryo-oh-ki-chan!  Wait!" Sasami called out to the
cabbit, but Ryo-oh-ki was already gone.  "I wonder why she left so fast?
And what was she carrying, anyway?  Wait a minute!  If Ryo-oh-ki is
back, then that means that Ryoko must be back to!"
              Sasami quickly changed out of her pajamas, got into
her Sunday dress and went down the hallway, following the cabbit’s
trail.

              As Sasami walked down the hall, Tenchi stepped out of
his room.  "Sasami, what’s going on?" asked Tenchi.
              "Ryoko’s back.  I’m following Ryo-oh-ki to the living
room." Sasami replied, as she continued on her way.
              Muffled crashing could be heard as Nobuyuki made his
way out of the study.  "What’s that about Ryoko?" he asked, a book lay
open on top of his head.
              "Sasami said that Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki are back.
Come on, lets get down stairs." Tenchi said.  He and his father went
down to the living room.

##########################################################

              Washu and Ryoko stood in the middle of the room, a
couple of the bags were sitting next to them.
              "You do have the data on all one hundred and fifty of
them, right?" asked Washu.
              "For the last time, yes!" Ryoko exclaimed.  "Would
you just download the information already."
              Washu was just about to go on with some more usual
dribble, when Sasami, Tenchi, and Nobuyuki entered the room.  "Ryoko,
you’re back!!"  "Where have you been, young lady?"  "What did you
bring?"  You get the idea on how that goes.
              "Oh, hi guys." Ryoko replied.  She still felt very tired.
              "Hey, what are these?" Sasami asked, as she removed
one of the balls from a sack.
              "Ah, well those are-"
              Washu did not get to finish her explanation, as Sasami
pushed the button.  The ball opened up, and a light shot out of it.  The
light formed into a creature, about a foot and a half in height.  It was
white, with black ear tips on long pointy ears, rather short arms and legs,
a curly lock of hair on its head, what appeared to be ornamental wings
were on its back, and it had a curly tail.
              "Clefable!" the thing said.
              Oh, and there was one other thing about it.
              "Oh, it’s so adorable!!" Sasami squealed, as she
embraced the rather confused creature.
              "Cle?"
              "Would you pleas not let them out of the balls?" Ryoko
pleaded.  No one listened.
              "Cool!  I wonder what this one holds?" Tenchi said, as
he pulled out another ball, and pressed the button.
              Once more the light shot out, and became a creature.
This one looked like a bunch of greenish-blue vines, around a pair of
eyes, and feet.  While it was not as cute as the Clefable, it was not very
threatening.  "Tangela." The thing murmured, in a high pitched voice.
              "Please, don’t do that." Ryoko said.
              "Gee, I wonder what this one is?" Nobuyuki pulled out
a ball, and of course pressed the button.
              The creature that came out of the ball, made some
rather frightening noises, rolled its eyes, and licked Nobuyuki’s face.
Nobuyuki fainted.  The cat-like shadow creature seemed very amused
about this.
              "Gengar!  Gengar!"  The thing chanted, in an almost
laughing tone.
              "I think you’re just wasting your breath, dear." Washu
told Ryoko.
              And they continued to open the spheres.

##########################################################

              Two women walked up to the Masaki house.
              "Mihoshi, how can you be sure that she’s back,
anyway?" Kiyone asked, still rather grouchy from waking up this early,
on a Sunday.
              "I just have this feeling, Kiyone." Answered the Blond,
Galaxy Police, detective.
              They continued up to the door, and knocked politely.
Tenchi opened the door, in response.
              "Mihoshi, Kiyone, hello." Said Tenchi.  "You came at
a good time, Ryoko just came back this morning."
              "See, Kiyone!  I told you so." Said Mihoshi, rather
proud of her accomplishment.
              Kiyone was not paying attention to Mihoshi at the
moment.  "Uh, Tenchi?"
              "Yes, Kiyone?" Replied Tenchi.
              "Do you know that there’s a huge, walking, flower in
your living room?" Kiyone had a large sweatdrop on the back of her
head.
              "Uh, yes, well. . ." How does one explain giant,
walking, plants in one’s living room.  "Well you see, Ryoko brought
home some strange orbs from where she went to, and they contained
these weird creatures." Tenchi explained.
              "Wow!  Let me see!" Mihoshi ran into the living room,
to look at all of the weird creatures.
              "Mihoshi, be careful!" Yelled Kiyone.  "They may be
dangerous!"
              "Finally someone realizes that." Ryoko muttered,
sipping some strong tea, as she did not want to be any more sleepy.
              Mihoshi ignored both of them, and pressed the button
on one of the balls.  The creature popped out, and Mihoshi thought it
was VERY cute.
              "OH, IT’S SOOO CUTE!!!" Mihoshi’s voice nearly
shattered the tea cup Ryoko was holding.  "Kiyone, look!  Isn’t it cute!"
              The thing looked like a pink rabbit, without a tail.
While it was cute enough to give cavities, the bright blue eyes, and the
cheerful smile resembled Mihoshi a little too much for Kiyone’s tastes.
              "Wigglytuff." The thing said.
              "Uh-huh, great.  Now please get that thing out of my
face." Kiyone went over to the sacks.  "So those things are kept in this?"
Kiyone ‘accidentally’ pushed the button.
              The thing that came out of it looked like a jeweled
starfish, with another starfish attached to its back.  It was actually very
pretty.
              "Mie!" said the thing.  It sounded like a grunt,
actually.
              "Will this one seems harmless enough." Said Kiyone,
admiring her reflection in the gem.
              "Be careful with that one, Kiyone." Said Ryoko.  "It
has a tendency to-" The Starmie squirted water into Kiyone’s face.
"squirt people who stare at it. . ." Ryoko finished.
              "Hey, Ryoko." Said Sasami.  "Do these things say
anything else, besides their names?"
              "No, and you should be glad of that." Replied Ryoko.
"The one that I met who COULD talk, wouldn’t shut up."
              "Where did all these come from anyway?" asked
Tenchi.
              Washu was about to go into a lengthily explanation,
but Ryoko cut her off.  "I’ll explain.  Several thousand years ago, Washu
accidentally sent several of the Mass to another dimension.  In that
dimension, the Mass evolved into different creatures, kind of like on
Earth.  About a month ago, Washu got a pen-pal in that dimension, and
found out what happened to the Mass.  She sent me there to collect
specimens and information of all the creatures that they turned into."
              "Wow!" exclaimed Sasami.  "That sounds like fun!"
              Ryoko shook her head.  "If only it was.  You see, the
creatures there are sought after by everyone there.  They collect them,
breed them, and sell them.  They call them ‘Pokemon’."
              "Pokemon?" Tenchi asked.
              "Short for ‘Pocket Monster’." Ryoko explained.
"Anyway, I had to use Ryo-oh-ki in duels involving the Pokemon."
Ryoko glared at Washu, who just stared blandly back.  "Almost
everywhere I went, people were trying to take my ‘Unknown Pokemon’
to add to their collection." Ryoko smirked.  "Not that I would let them,
or that any of them were a match for Ryo-oh-ki’s ship form."
              "Very interesting." Said Yosho, standing in the
doorway.
              "Grandpa!" Tenchi was surprised to see his
grandfather, this early in the morning.
              "I decided to come down when I noticed that you were
all in the living room.  I guessed that it meant Ryoko and Ryo-oh-ki had
returned." Yosho then looked at the surrounding group.  "Where’s
Ayeka?  I would expect her to be here as well."
              "I don’t know." Replied Sasami.  "She wasn’t in bed
when I woke up.  I thought she may have come down here earlier."
              Ryoko slammed her forehead against the table, and
sounded like she was about to cry.  "Great.  Just, great.  She’s probably
scared out of her mind, and running from the monster she let loose."
              The house then began to shake, uncontrollably.  Before
anyone could ask what it was about, a loud cry was heard through the
rumbling noise.
              "YAHOOOOOOOO!!!" Ayeka yelled.
              The rumbling became even more audible, as what was
causing it passed by.  It was Ayeka, riding on top of a giant snake, that
seemed to be made out of boulders.  Ayeka appeared to be enjoying
herself, as she rode off into the valley.
              The serpent she was riding let out a roar, that sounded
vaguely like, "OOOOOOONIXX!!"
              Everyone else, had large sweatdrops on their heads.
              "Then again, maybe not." Ryoko said.

              Mayuka sat on the floor.  She looked at one of the balls
that had rolled out of a bag.  It was too big for her to swallow, so she
decided to push the button instead.  The creature that was inside,
materialized under Mayuka.
              Monster and baby stared at each other.  Both were
more confused than scared.  The large, sleepy, bear-like thing briefly
scratched its head, wondering what was on its large, furry belly.
"Snorlax?" asked the Snorlax.
              "goo. . . ." said Mayuka.
              The Snorlax did not understand.  The Snorlax did not
really care.  Deciding that whatever was on its belly was not dangerous,
it yawned, stretched its arms, and went to sleep.
              Mayuka decided that the Snorlax had a very good idea.
She yawned, and also went to sleep.  Soon they were snoring in a
synchronous manner.

                  Things continued on like this, until Nobuyuki found
something
interesting.
              "Hey, Ryoko!" Nobuyuki called from the corner of the
room.  "This ball just let out a larger one!  Is it supposed to do that?"
              Ryoko looked at what Nobuyuki was holding.  "That’s
not a ball, it’s a Voltorb."
              "Voltorb?" Nobuyuki asked.
              "Voltorb." The thing sounded, in a electronic-like
voice.
              "Be careful with that thing." Ryoko warned.  "It tends
to-"
*ZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!*
"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!"
              "Shock people. . ." Ryoko finished. Gee, twice in one
day.
              Yosho put on a pair of rubber gloves, and lifted the
Voltorb off of Nobuyuki’s smoldering body.
              "Very interesting." Yosho observed.  "Does it do
anything else, besides shock people?"
              "Well it explodes, if you make it angry." Ryoko
replied.
              "Really?  And what makes it angry?" said Yosho, as he
started tossing the Voltorb up and down, like a ball.
              "Well, tossing it up and down, like a ball, gets it mad
pretty quickly." Said Ryoko, not noticing what Yosho was doing.
                                           *KA-BLAM!!!!!!!*
              After the smoke cleared.  Washu was very unhappy.
"Look what you did!  Now I have to heal the poor thing!  What do you
have to say for yourself, Yosho!?" Washu snapped.
              "Pretty birds.  Pretty birds.  Pretty birds." Yosho just
kept chanting, over and over, in his dazed state.
              "Poor Voltorb." Said Sasami, sadly.  The orb looked
like it had gone through the trash compactor.  Twice!
              "Don’t worry." said Washu.  "I can heal it back in my
lab." Washu then smirked.  "And I can always send Ryoko back for
more!"
              Ryoko did a spit take. *SPLOOOO!!!* "WHAT!?!?!"
              Washu seemed unfazed by Ryoko’s outburst.  "There
are probably more Pokemon then what Ryoko found, anyway.  I can
always send her back to get the new ones, to!" Washu then started her
victory/happy/crazy cackle.
              Ryoko looked really pissed.  Probably because she was
really pissed.  She reached into her pocket, and pulled out what appeared
to be one of the balls that were used to contain the Pokemon, only it was
the size of a Ping-Pong ball.  Ryoko pressed the button, and it suddenly
swelled to the size of a grapefruit.
              "Poke-ball, Go!!!" Ryoko yelled, as she threw the ball
at Washu.
              "Poke-what?" Washu turned her head, just in time to
be hit in the face with the Poke-ball. "OW!  Hey, what did ya do that f-"
Washu looked at the inside of the ball, and realized what was going to
happen.  "NO!  WAIT! ARRRGH!!!"  Washu became a bunch of colored
light, and went into the ball.  The ball closed, and muffled screams could
be heard as the ball jumped around slightly.  Finally the button turned
from red, to blue.  *DING!*
              Ryoko laughed as she walked over to where Washu had
stood, and picked up the Poke-ball.  "Well look.  I caught Washu."
              "Let me out of here now, Ryoko!!!" Washu’s muffled
screams could be heard from inside the ball.  "This is no way to treat
your mother!!!"
              "Hmm. . .  I wonder." Ryoko pulled out what appeared
to be a red ‘Game-boy’, and clicked it at the Poke-ball.
              *Unknown Pokemon.* said the Poke-dex.  *Processing
new data. . .  Processing completed.  Washu:  Genius Pokemon.
Confuses opponents by telling them incomprehensible technical babble,
and then bores them to unconsciousness, with over exaggerated
explanations.*
              "I heard that!!" yelled Washu, from inside her Poke-
ball.
              Ryo-oh-ki then toddled in from the hallway.  She was
still carrying around the ball, that had her paw print on it.
              "Ryo-oh-ki, there you are." Said Sasami.  She then saw
the Poke-ball that the cabbit was holding.  "What’s that you got there?"
              Ryoko spoke up.  "That one, she caught herself.  I
don’t know why she keeps that thing.  The Pokemon in there is a little
terror, as far as I’m concerned." She then sighed.  "But she treats that
thing like it was her own child, so I let her keep it."
              "Can we see what it is?" asked Sasami.
              "Okay, but you had all better stand back.  That thing’s
really dangerous." Replied Ryoko.
              They all got a safe distance from the cabbit, and her
Poke-ball.
              "Okay, Ryo-oh-ki.  You can let it out now." Said
Ryoko.
              Ryo-oh-ki pressed the button.  It opened up, and the
creature came out.  It reared back its head, and let loose with its call,
which was also its name.  A name that struck terror in the hearts of
mortal men.  A creature that could frighten the souls of true heroes.

              "Pikachu!" the thing squeaked.

AUTHORS NOTES:
  Whew!  It’s finally done!
  I started this a month ago, and just got back to it now.
I am a BIG fan of Tenchi Muyo, and Pokemon, so I decided to put them
both into a X-over.
  Between school work, and my life in general, I’m
finding it harder and harder to write Fan Fiction like I used to.  But have
no fear, I’m going to keep trying.
  If you like this story, tell me.  I do admit, it is not quite
as bad of a story as I first thought it would be.  If you don’t like it, you
should see the garbage that I’m not proud of.
  Oh, and before I go, I’d like to put down something
from ‘Magic The Gathering’, that I think goes nicely after a story like
this.  Enjoy.  ^_^

"It was big.  Really, really big.  No, bigger than that.  Even bigger.  Keep
going.  More.  No, more.  Look, we’re talking krakens and dreadnoughts
for jewelry.  It was big!" - Arna Kennerud, skynight.

  Well, I HOPE I corrected the justification problem, that
occurred the first time this was posted.  That scene with Mayuka was one
that I forgot to put in, when I first completed this story.  I’ve got one
hundred and nineteen Pokemon listed in my game, now.  I even have a
Mew.  HORAY!!!
  Well, now for how my work is coming along.  I’m still
working on the sequel to "Ruby Red, Cat Like Eyes.", adding on parts
when the mood hits me.  That’s when I do my best, don’tcha know ^_^.
To stir up my creativity I’ve also been working on a couple of MST’s.
Add that to the fact that I’m editing Fan Fics for someone (Hint:  Look
in the Crossover section of GenSao's archive.), and I’m preparing to
go to college later this year, and you’ve got the reasons why my work
has been slowing down these past few months.  Oh, well.  Until we meet
again.
