Copyright stuff: Blah blah blah.


Last time on Nintenchi!

We went to Hyrule, where we fought Ganondorf. Beating him was easy, but he 
transformed into Ganon. Tenchi and Link beat him and we were on our way to the 
Mushroom Kingdom when an explosion tumbled us into a hole. An interdimensional 
rift opened up, and you know what that means...

Nintenchi!

Episode D1 (the D stands for Departure)
Card Captor Sakuya
(o   “r: No Need for Another Cardcaptor)

Chapter 1 
2 "Saks" Back to Back!
(or: No Need for Clow Cards)
(Cardcaptor world)
One day, Kero, Sakura, and Madison were searching for Clow Cards.
"There's a Clow Card around," said Kero.
"Well, which one is it?" said Sakura.
"I think it's..." said Kero, when suddenly an interdimensional rift opened up, 
and out we came with our torpedopod. CRASH!
"It's the Rift Card!"
"Oh, this is terrible!" said Sakura.
Sakuya climbed out of the wreckage. Amazingly, none of us were hurt.
"IT'S SAKURA! I LOVE THAT SHOW!" shouted Sakuya happily. She ran over to the 
confused Cardcaptor.
"Your show is so cool and I watch it all the time and can I have your autograph 
because I've always wanted to meet you ever since I saw the first episode 
and..." said Sakuya quickly.
Tenchi grabbed Sakuya by the ear like Misty always does to Brock and dragged her 
to the torpedopod.
"Now how are we going to get out of here?" asked Mihoshi.
"We need to capture the Rift Card." said Kero.
Suddenly, Sa   okuya remembered she had a small key-looking item in her pocket 
from Hyrule. It looked like a short rod with a Triforce at one end and a weird 
symbol at the other. She had thought it was useless until she took it out, Kero 
saw it and was amazed.
"That's... the World's Wand!" he said.
"The World's Wand? What's that?" asked Sakura.
"It means SHE is the third Cardcaptor!"
"Who... oh, it's you, Li." said Sakura.
"I always thought it was only a legend, but now I see it. It looks like you're 
with us." said Li. "You're going to help capture the Rift Card, right?"
"Yeah, I guess..." said Sakuya.
"Who are you, anyway?" asked Li.
"My name's Sakuya..." Sakuya answered.
"I'm Tenchi..." Tenchi said.
"I'm Tom..." I said.
"I'm the genius scientist, Washu..." Washu said.

She waited.

Then two voices said, "We're working on a new one!"

Then, finally, the two puppets popped out.

"Oh, no." said Tenchi.

"To protect Washu from devastation!"
"To bring Washu's genius to every nation!"
"To denounce the evils of her bei   Ung un-loved!"
"To extend our reach to Jurai above!"
"Washu A!"
"Washu B!"
"Team Washu, blast off at the speed of light!"
"We're telling you Washu is just so bright!"
They popped back in and Washu said,
"Washu! Thaaaaaat's right!"

Everyone was left droop-eyed.

"Well, anyway, I'm Ayeka..." said Ayeka.
"I'm Ryoko..." said Ryoko.
"I'm Kiyone, and she's Mihoshi." said Kiyone.
"I'm Yosho..." said Yosho.
"And/or Katsuhito!" I reminded him.
"And I'm Noboyuki!" said Noboyuki.

"Well, are we going to capture the Rift Card, or what?" said Kero.
"Right." said all three Cardcaptors, and ran off.
"Wait! Sakuya, you can't just leave us here!" shouted Tenchi. We all ran off 
after the Cardcaptors.

Chapter 2 
We've Been Rifted!
(or: No Need for the World's Wand)

"We need to know where the Rift Card is." said Sakuya when we finally caught up 
to her.
"Why don't we split up?" I suggested.
"We can't cover the whole town that way!" said Sakura.
"Oh, yes we can!" said Li.
"How?" said Kiyone.   Š
"Force, know my plight! Release the light! TWIN!" shouted Li, and instantly each 
and every one of us had an exact double!
"The Twin Card! Great idea!" said both Sakuras.
"Hey, I was going to say that first!" said one of them.
"No, I was!" said the other.
"It's no use arguing, Sakuras. We have to all go different ways." said both 
Sakuyas. And all of us ran off looking for the Rift Card. We all got lost, but 
eventually, very confused, we suddenly ended up back where we started.
"What happened?" said one of the Ryokos.
"Must have been the Rift Card itself!" shouted both Keros, evidently trying to 
make a point.
"This is getting confusing. Twin Card, singular now!" shouted Li again, and then 
only one of each of us was left.
"Phew." said Ryoko. "I was beginning to think it was hopeless. TWO Sakuyas! What 
a nightmare."
"Rift Card! Show yourself!" shouted Sakura, and suddenly a big, donut shaped 
thing appeared.
"Must be the Rift Card." said Kero.
The Rift Card bounced around all over the plac   ye, zapping us to different 
locations.
"We have to stop the b-" said Li, when he was zapped to the roof of a house.
"Windy Card! Stop the Rift Card from bouncing!" said Sakura as she released the 
Windy Card.
The Windy Card wrapped around the Rift Card, stopping it in place.
"Return to your power con-"
Suddenly, the Rift Card broke free and started bouncing around again.
"Oops." said Sakura.
"I could try catching it in a Poke Ball!" said Tenchi.
"That wouldn't... work." said Sakuya. "Wait. We can't catch it IN a Poke Ball, 
but we can USE a Poke Ball!"
"Huh?" said Mihoshi.
"ILLUSION...
POKE...
BALL...
CREATION!" said Sakuya. She created a Poke Ball! "I choose you! Articuno! Use 
your Ice Beam attack to freeze the Rift Card!" Articuno appeared from the ball.
I   3t shot an Ice Beam at the Rift Card and zapped it with it. It froze.
"How do you activate the World's Wand to capture this thing?" said Sakuya.
"Just shout, World's Wand, activate! Nothing to it!"
"World's Wand, activate!" shouted Sakuya, and the World's Wand grew into an 
actual wand, much like the Key of Clow.
"Return to your power confined! RIFT!" shouted Sakuya, and the Rift Card 
disappeared, and Sakuya got it when the card itself appeared.

Chapter 3 
Back to Nintendia
(or: No Need for Goodbye)

"Well, time to get going!" I said.
"What? You're not taking Sakuya, are you?" said Sakura.
"Yeah, I'm done capturing cards." said Sakuya.
"We need you! The more Cardcaptors there are, the better!" said Li.
"But I need Tenchi just about as much as you need me, and he doesn't want even 
MORE things to have to fight.   o I'm going with him." said Sakuya, as she re-
released the Rift Card.
"Sakuya, don't..."
But we had already gone through.
We reappeared in the Mushroom Kingdom. We expected to see Mario or Peach or 
someone, but instead, we saw...
MAELIN???
"Hi!" said MaElin.
"MaElin? What are you doing here?" said Sakuya.
"One of the Clow Cards apparently visited my house." Maelin answered.
"Well, it's OK to come with us!" said Tenchi.
"I bet she's gonna start hitting on him!" I said.
Everyone else agreed.
