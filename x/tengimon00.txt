story:PROLOGUE:
    TENCHI’S DAD HAD JUST BOUGHT A COMPUTER. WHILE ON THE
INTERNET , TENCHI GOT SUCKED INTO IT ALONG WITH RYO-OKI AND
FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE DIGITAL WORLD. IN A CAVE  TENCHI FOUND
HIS D3 DIGIVICE AND A DIGIEGG BUT NO DIGIMON. WHERE IS HIS
DIGIMON?

    TENCHI WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT
HE WAS DOING THERE WHEN OUT OF THE GROUND CAME DRIMOGOMON
WITH A DARK RING AROUND HIS NECK. TENCHI WAS WORIED FOR HE HAD
NEVER SEEN THIS KIND OF BEAST BEFORE. RYO-OKI WAS TRYING TO
FIGHT DRIMOGOMON  WHEN SUDDENLY THE DIGIVICE BEGAN TO GLOW
AND RYO-OKI BEGAN TO CHANGE.  FROM RYO-OKI’S DIRECTION, TENCHI
HEARD A VOICE GOING RYO-OKIMON ARMOR DIGIVOLVE TO ........
CARROTMON. TENCHI BEING SURPRISED AND SCARED JUMPED UP AND
DEMANDED RYO-OKI TELL HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT ALL THAT
RYO-OKI DID WAS YELL ROOT BLASTER AND BREAK THE DARK RING
AROUNDDRIMOGOMONS NECK.DRIMOGOMON THANKED RYO-OKI AND
LEFT. RYO-OKI  CHANGED BACK TO NORMAL. SHE SAID, “ TENCHI YOU
SEEM TO BE THE THIRTEENTH DIGIDESTINED AND I AM YOUR DIGIMON.  I
WAS ONLY ABLE TO CHANGE, OR DIGIVOLVE AS IT IS NORMALY CALLED,
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN DANGER. I WILL PROTECT YOU IF WE EVER RUN
INTO DANGER AGAIN.”

    “ I THOUGHT DIGIMON WAS JUST A SHOW. SUSAMI WATCHES IT ALL
THE TIME”, SAID TENCHI.

    “ YES, I KNOW. BILL GATES, A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER IN
AMERICA, THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND MADE HIS OWN DIGIWORLD”, SAID
RYO-OKI.

     TENCHI AND RYO-OKI TRAVELED THROUGH THE DIGITAL WORLD
FOR MANY DAYS, WHILE AT HIS HOUSE THE WHOLE FAMILY  WAS
GETTING QUITE SUSPICIOS. “ I DON’T THINK ANY ONE’S MISSING.
WASHU’S STILL IN HER LAB, ISN’T SHE?” ASKED NOBOYUKI.

    “HE BETTER NOT HAVE GONE OFF WITH NAGI OR ELSE I WILL KILL
HIM.SAKUYA IS GONE SO HE COULDN’T HAVE GONE WITH HER”, SAID
RYOKO.

    “RYO-OKI’S GONE TOO”, CRIED SUSAMI,” I NOTICED WHEN SHE
DIDN’T TRY TO STEAL THE CARROTS I WAS GOING TO PUT IN MY SOUP
THURSDAY. THAT’S THE ONLY REASON WE’VE HAD CARROTS IN A LOT
OF SOUPS LATELY.”

    WASHU PEAKS OUT OF THE LAB AND TELLS EVERYONE SHE HAS
SOMETHING TO SHOW THEM

    “ I WAS BORED OF DOING RESEARCH AND DECIDED TO SEARCH
DRAGONBALL Z SITES ON  THE INTERNET BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH
RYOKO LIKES THAT STUFF AND WANTED TO FIND SOME TOP SECRET
STUFF WHICH I NEW THE ANIMATION COMPANY WAS HIDING WHEN I
STUMBELED ACROSS A SITE LABELED ‘ THE REAL DIGIWORLD’ SO I
CHECKED IT OUT.
IT TURNS OUT THAT’S WHERE TENCHI AND RYO-OKI ARE AND NOW
RYO-OKI HAS A NEW THING TO TRANSFORM INTO , CARROTMON.I CAN’T
FIND A WAY YET TO GET TENCHI OUT THOUGH. SO I JUST WANTED YOU
TO HE IS SAFE AND NO, HE DID NOT RUN AWAY WITH ANOTHER GIRL”
SAID WASHU.

    “OH, THANKS MOM, BUT DID YOU FIND ANY COOL DBZ STUFF
TOO?”ASKED THE SLIGHTLY ANNOYED RYOKO .

    BACK AT THE DIGIWORLD TENCHI WAS TRYING TO FIND ANYTHING
EXCEPT DIGIMON HE THOUGHT THAT IF HE WAS THE THIRTEENTH
DIGIDESTINED THERE MUST BE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND AND THAT’S
WHEN PEGASUSMON AND NEFERTIMON COME WITH T.K. AND KARI ON
THEIR BACKS. THEY HAD JUST BEATEN ONE OF THE EMPORORS DIGIMON
WHEN THEY SPOTTED TENCHI. THEY WENT DOWN TO ATTACK THEM
WHEN TENCHI YELLED, “ DIGI ARMOR ENERGIZE” AND RYO-OKI CHANGED
INTO CARROTMON AND TURNED PEGASUSMON AND NEFERTIMON  BACK
INTO PATAMON AND GATOMON.

    T.K. SAID “ I’M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE DIGIMON
EMPOROR”

    “ HI, I’M TENCHI MASAKI, CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET OUT OF
THIS PLACE AND BACK TO OKOYAMA?”

    “ OH WE’RE IN TOKYO AND WE’RE BROKE SO WE CAN’T PAY FOR A
TRIP. UNLESS YOU HAVE A WAY TO GET BACK ,LIKE YOU’RE PART OF THE
CAPSULE CORPORATION. HA HA” SAID KARI .


    “NO BUT MY DIGIMON CAME FROM THE REAL WORLD THOUGH”,
SAID TENCHI ,” AND IT CAN FLY IN ANOTHER FORM”.

    “OK THEN, WE’LL SHOW YOU WHERE EXIT IS “,SAID T.K.

    “ALL RIGHT, I’VE BEEN STUCK HERE FOR DAYS AND FRANKLY , I’M
STARVING”SAID TENCHI.

    “HERE IS THE EXIT PUT YOUR DIGIVICE TO THE SCREEN AND
YOU’LL BE TELEPORTED TO TOKYO”

    3 SECONDS LATER...........

    SPLAT

    “OOPS”

    “YOU SQUISHED UPAMON”YELLED CODY WHO WAS STANDING
NEAR THE DIGIPORT.

    “YEAAAAAA”, YELLED EVERYONE EXCEPT YOLEI,CODY AND
TENCHI.

    “OK, I’LL GETTING HOME , BYE NOW.”SAID TENCHI.TENCHI GOT ON
RYO-OHKI AND HEADED HOME .



    AT HOME ALL THE GIRLS WERE HAPPY TO SEE HIM EXCEPT FOR
WASHU WHO WAS TRYING TO GET A TYRANNOMON BACK THROUGH THE
PORT WHICH SHE   HAD MADE. TENCHI WAS HAPPY HE WAS HOME .
WHILE IN THE DIGIWORLD TENCHI THOUGHT MORE LOVINGLY AND
HAPPILY ABOUT RYOKO. TENCHI , REALIZING RYOKO WOULD AT VERY
BEST TRY TO KILL ANY WHO LOVED HIM, TENCHI FELL IN LOVE, HANDED
THE DIGIVICE TO SASAMI, MARRIED RYOKO AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER
AFTER WITH A SPACE PIRATE.

WAIT A SECOND.  I’M GOING TO POINT OUT ERRORS BEFORE ANY BODY
ELSE DOES.1) SURE I GUESS ALONG WITH THE DIGIWORLD BILL GATES
MADE THE KIDS TOO. NO. 2) SAKUYA AND NAGI AREN’T IN THE SAME
SERIES. ALSO I HAVE TO DO THE CRAP ABOUT WHO THIS BELONGS TO
TOO. OK, TENCHI AND ALL OTHER CHARACTERS BELONG TO PIONEER
AND DIGIMON AND DRAGONBALL Z BELONG TOEI ANIMATION
