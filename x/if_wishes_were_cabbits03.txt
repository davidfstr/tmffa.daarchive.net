Chapter 3--- Plans Form, Deal Struck.

Disclaimer: (Okay, You know the drill)
Tenchi Muyo and the gang are owned by AIC and Pioneer, and the respected

masters in the Japanese realm. Star trek Deep Space Nine is owned by the

Paramount Studios and respectively Rick Bergman and Mike Pillar. We are
just two kids fooling around so don’t sue us. We don’t got the money.

Andrew: (chewing on a sandwich) Hey, girlfriend, what are you working
on? (He sits behind Rebb01, curious.)

Glyph: Next chapter in the crossover of Tenchi Muyo and Deep Space Nine…

Andrew: Oh. (Muttering.) What is wrong in this chair?

Rebb01: Hey, off de tail, man!

Andrew: Huh? (Then realizing he was sitting on something, gets up enough

for the thing to slide out.) Sorry, not used to you bein’ here.

Glyph: Hey, can we get on with the chapter?

Tenchi felt something poke into his gut as he got up. He reached for it.

Oh, the sword. It must have shifted when he sat down to eat. Sometimes,
he thought about getting a sheath for it.
Maybe that Odo hadn’t seen it. But for the sake of the others, he got
up.
“I’ll be right back,” he called to the others.
Sasami got up, followed by Ryo-Oki. “Can we go with you?” the girls
asked. Or rather Sasami did since Ryo-oki couldn’t. He smiled.

Sisko frowned. He asked for Dukat to meet him in his office.
 Dukat.
Can he ever shake the Cardassian from this place? Major Kira had
returned to her consul, luckily keeping her mouth shut. She kept up an
appearance of civility for her friend, Ziyal. Dukat’s daughter, the girl

was half Bajoran. Sisko hadn’t quite figured out how the major sorted
this out.
Maybe he shouldn’t worry about it.
If only he could figure out how the Cardassian met the strange group.
Ben leaned over an old Federation report. His search on “Jurai” had come

up with something.
This was the piece that fit in.
One was human, that boy Tenchi—As far as Sisko could remember, there
hadn’t been any human that had explored the Gamma Quadrant beyond a few
hundred light years of  wormhole…

A small tap on the glass to the door. Tenchi listened to the door hiss
open.
“Can I help you, of heaven and of earth?” The constable didn’t look up
as he typed on a panel. Tenchi stared puzzled for a moment. Odo finally
looked up. “Isn’t that your name?” he tried to smile at the boy.
“Uh--,” Tenchi tried to say something… “Well, that what it means.”
“The universal translator must have overcompensated, translating the
meaning of your names in Bajoran.” Odo then touched another panel. “At
least, it better than mine in translation.”
“What do you mean by that?” Sasami asked.
Odo tilted his head, then “Odo wetao, ‘Nothing in the jar’,” he
shrugged.
Ryo-oki meowed, then placed her hand on the desk. It made Tenchi
remember what he had arrived here to do. He slid the sword from the belt

and palmed it over to the constable.
“ I thought that all weapons were off the Promenade. I had forgotten
about this one.”
Odo looked skeptically at the light sword. “Hurumph, what does that do?”

It was just a tree branch to him.
Tenchi took it back for a minute. He would just have to show him. He
tried to concentrate.
Sasami tilted her head to Ryo-Oki. She shrugged.
Nothing was happening. Tenchi banged it with his palm. “Dammit! Why
now?”
Odo crossed his arms, still trying to keep his expression blank. This
young man could be a comedy act.
Then Tenchi banged it against the desk.
 “Not on that!” Odo started to his feet, then suddenly, he winced. There

was a slight prickle on his temple.
Tenchi hit the sword into his palm again, and Odo seemed to relax. A
little.
“It not working,” Tenchi muttered.
“Young Man,” Odo finally caught his attention, “If you are wasting my
time--,”
Tenchi lowered the sword in frustration, and Odo relented. “If this is

broken, maybe Chief O’Brien or someone in engineering would know how to
repair it. Until that time, I’m certain that it isn’t a weapon, and that

no one would be harmed by it. Please do NOT bother turning it in.”
Tenchi Masaki smiled a little. He slipped it back where he had it.

Mihoshi followed after Washu onto the main floor of the Promenade. Washu

brought up her holographic laptop and typed in the room numbers Jadzia
had given her for the ambassador’s suites. They will all have the same
living quarters while on the station, just some different rooms.
Luckily.
She made the board disappear. “Let’s go, Mihoshi.”
“But can we do some shopping?” The girl asked. This was rather like a
vacation. And she wanted to take it like one.

Commander Worf leaned against the rail. Then a familiar arm touched his
and Jadzia Dax slid in next to him. “Hi,” she looked over the rail as
well. “Watching Jake’s spot for him?”
He did not acknowledge the joke. Instead, his attention was on someone
in the crowd below. Jadzia found that his hand was tensing on the bar in

front of then both.
“When did SHE get here?” he spat. Jadzia looked down, trying to find who

he meant. “I do not believe it,” He continued to snarl. “Is there any
place where she can not find me?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Do you see the blonde heading to the airlock? The one following the
girl down there?”
Jadzia looked, then tired to keep a straight face. “I didn’t think she
was your type, Commander,” then seeing his growl, added, “She’s part of
the Jurai Delegation that just came in. You know her?”
Worf kept the snarl. Unfortunately, it sounded like he knew  the woman
all right. But the feeling wasn’t in friendship.

In the vastness of space/time and eternity, they can be called demons,
or evil spirits, But they held the ultimate grudge.

“We have searched the entirety of reality and I believe we’ve  found a
compatible subject.”

“Where?”

“A dimension quite different from our own. He is very powerful. An
entity that has the ability to destroy our enemies.”

“How will we control him? If he is able to destroy them, he could easily

destroy us as well.”

 “ We must have one of  our own with him.”

“Very well, then.”

Somewhere in the vastness of space, something was moving very fast. It
left a wake in the vacuum of space. Water like and with great speed it
moved quickly to its destination.  A bright flash of crimson opened a
blossom in front of the very stunned creature. He tried to veer. The
gravity well however overcame him. He let a surprised shriek out as the
crimson blossom closed again.
Then he found himself heading up or down in a rock tunnel.

“He has come!”

“Who are you? Why Have you brought me here?”

“You have been chosen to help us.”

“Why the hell should I?”

“You thrive where there is no…. Jurai energy. We can lead you to a place

where it never existed.”

“What do I have to do?”

##############################################################

A runabout was passing the outer stratosphere. Keiko O’Brien looked over

her data in the file on certain plant species. Still, she knew she
should be leaning back and resting. Miles would be so thrilled to see
her. Molly played with a game in her bag. Her daughter’s play reminded
her again to relax. If only she could get all this data in… Oh, if only
she could finish this up! They had basically told her she needed this
break.
 She did want to see her husband and her baby boy again.
The runabout dipped abruptly. Molly let out a surprised shriek. Kieko
felt her head start to spin, and only thought about her children. The
runabout kept turning, flipping end over end. The pilot hit a few
buttons and righted the craft.
“What the--! We just got buzzed by .. SOMETHING!”

Odo held a report in his hand as he got out from behind the desk. Tenchi

gave a polite bow, to which Odo had to think a moment and return the
same. He had turned away to check on the prisoners…
And felt unsteady and very sick. He suddenly grabbed for a nearby wall.
“Mr. Odo!” Sasami blurted out. Odo felt the floor abruptly meet his face

as he fell. Tenchi raced towards him.
“Are you all right?” The boy asked.
Odo  moved to a sitting position. It had felt like the whole floor had
suddenly moved under his feet, violently. He had a gag in his mouth. Do
Changelings Throw up?
Tenchi started to call for help. Ryo-Oki picked up Odo’s arm and rubbed
her cheek into his side.
“I’m satisfactory for now, Mr. Masaki. You do not need to worry.” He
started to get to his feet. Whatever had caused the odd attack had
obviously subsided. What had caused it?

Author’s note:

Rebb01: Excitin’ Huh?

Glyph: yes, no, maybe, your call, Andrew, anybody.
