Warning and Disclaimer: don't take this too seriously and don't really own 
any of these characters.

Last Episode: Ayeka, Ihrie and Akane begin to figure out why they all feel 
sort of familiar to each other. Ihrie finds out that her old boyfriend was 
Fam's grandson and her half-brother. The Manos discover that they're 
half-demon. Ryouga is revealed as Mihoshi's brother. And Nabiki and Washu 
have an argument over dimensional pockets.

"What's the matter Skuld?" Urd asked her rather frantic sister. The 
younger goddess looked up from her scanner.
"LOOK AT THIS!! There are multiple time-distortions all in one place!! 
How did this happen?" Urd took a moment to look and then put her own powers 
to the test.
"Oh, that explains it," Urd said finally. Skuld looked at her sister 
questionably. "Sis's great-grandaughters."
"Oh please," Skuld sniffed. "Her grandaughter wasn't even born on this 
world, besides aside from this Keiichi person you want to hook her up with 
she hasn't had a boyfriend in millennia. If her relatives really really were 
here there'd be..." Skuld looked at her scanner and slumped.
"Multiple time-distortions all in one place?" Urd smirked.
"Okay, Okay, but THESE three have been here all their lives," Skuld 
pointed out. "And they haven't set off any of my scanners....well two of 
them are half-mazoku, but that's a different story...and what about them and 
that half-elf!?!" She looked at her scanners a little longer. "HOW MANY 
HALF MAZOKU ARE ON THIS PLANET!??!? SAIYAN?!? They haven't even evolved 
yet!!! ARRGGG!!!"
Urd was unsuccessfully trying to hold in her laughter. This whole set up 
was well worth the look on her youngest sister's face.
"Oh my," Urd stopped laughing and turned to face her sister. "Perhaps we 
should pay them a visit."
*******************************************************
While Nabiki and that green-haired woman were talking to the three 
exorcists, Ukyou and her mother had their own discussion. Jiro sat off to 
the side looking rather nervous and annoyed.
"You mean I could stay young FOREVER?" Ukyou asked, her eyes began take on 
the appearance of stars.
"Hey, this is not as great as it might seem!" Leaf snapped.
"What could be bad about living forever?" Ukyou asked, confused. Leaf 
sighed expressively.
"Well there is the tendency to outlive many of the people you care about," 
both turned to look at Nodoka and blinked.
"Err, how would you know what that's like?" Leaf asked, confused.
"Oh, I'm about three hundred years old," Nodoka said serenly. Ukyou face 
faulted, while Leaf tried to figure out what she was. "I'm Father's oldest 
child you see, at least as far as I know."
"How!?" both demanded at once.
"The power of Jurai," a new voice said. Leaf irritably turned to face the 
older man. "It keeps our people young for a long time, I myself have been 
around for several thousand years, and been on Earth for a little over eight 
hundred years."
"Okay, I'm glad to meet another few long-lived people, but this is a 
family thing so SHEW!!" Leaf waved the intelopers away doing her best to 
ignore the amused looks on their faces. She turned back to see her daughter 
smirking conspiratorily.
"That means all I have to do is outlive Akane! If that's Ranchan's mother 
and grandfather he could live practically forever too!"
~Great, I wonder if she'll by able to hear the other consequences now.~ 
Leaf sighed expressively, this was going to take longer than she thought. 
Privacy would be nice but she was not about to trust that greedy girl again. 
Even supposing her intentions were good.
*******************************************************
After being shewed away by the irritated half-elf, Nodoka walked over and 
stared at Jiro Kuonji. Having been on the recieving end of a lot of abuse 
lately this made him very nervous.
"You are Ukyou's father then?" she asked.
"Uh yes," he shifted nervously, aware that this was how a lot of bad 
things had started recently.
"So I assume you met my husband through the children."
"Well, actually no," he said, sweatdropping. "We both were taking this 
class on parenting and ethics, I guess Ukyou and Ranma started their 
friendship while waiting around for us."
"Parenting and ethics?" Nodoka blinked. "He took a class and still turned 
out as hideous a parent as that?"
"Considering my wife's reactions I'm beginning to think I didn't quite 
soak all the information either."
"What was the name of this class?"
"Parenting and Ethics, like I said," Jiro hmphed in frustration at the 
obtuseness of women. "The instructor's life has even been made into an 
American sitcom."
"Oh really, and what is this instructor's name?" Nodoka asked, curious.
"Al Bundy, I think," the elder Kuonji shrugged.
"By the way," Nodoka arranged her kimono momentarily. "You are aware that 
Genma is Ranma's stepfather, are you not?"
"No," he said slowly, looking at her nervously. "Why do you bring that 
up?"
"Well, you see the only engagements Ranma really has an obligation to 
uphold are those that I agreed to," she noted. "And I believe that the only 
one I was aware of until recently was the Tendo agreement. You see I left my 
son's martial arts training up to my husband, but I kept control otherwise." 
Jiro blinked for a moment.
"SAOTOME MUST DIE!!!!"
*******************************************************
"Nabiki!!" the named person turned to see her sister stalking out of the 
woods. Following her were the princess, and a third girl, who, surprise, 
surprise, felt familiar. Behind them came virtually everybody else, aside 
from Ranma, Sasami and Ryouga. However, the occaisional, "Ryouga-san you're 
going the wrong way," or "THAT WAY STUPID!!" could be heard.
"Detective Kiyone! You know something about all this I know you do!!"
"Yohko Mano," Nabiki said dryly to the demon-hunter that was still trying 
to wake up her sister. "Meet more of your sisters."
"Huh?" Yohko blinked letting Iako's head fall back to the ground. The 
more serious demon hunter woke up and snatched Yohko down to face her.
"Let's find the Kuno and get out of here," she growled.
"In case you're interested," Kiyone said as the crowd began to approach 
them. "Our father is supposed to be here with my mother to visit in a little 
while."
"In that case we can probably stay a little while longer," Iako said with 
a vicious smile that drew sweatdrops from Yohko and Kiyone.
"Okay, ONE of you two has got to know what's going on here," Akane 
snapped. "You've been getting along well since we got here!"
"Yes, Detective Kiyone, almost like you know each other from somewhere," 
Ayeka put in. Nabiki and Kiyone glanced at each other. Kiyone sighed 
expressively and hesitantly handed Nabiki a wad of cash.
"Well, Akane, you see Mother....had an affair," Nabiki said quietly. 
"We're not Daddy's children, not genetically at least."
"WHAT!!?" Akane blinked.
"Finally got here," Ranma muttered as he and Sasami guided Ryouga into the 
courtyard. Upon hearing Akane's shout he and Ryouga leaped over.
"What's going..."
"RYOUGA-CHAN!!" Ryouga barely had time to register the voice before he was 
glomped. "I'm so HAPPY to see you again!!"
"AGGG!! Mihoshi??" Ryouga sputtered, trying to breathe. "You're crushing 
me, could you calm down please?" Everybody paused a moment to watch, Ranma 
and Akane's jaw dropped. Somebody was squeezing Ryouga hard enough to cause 
pain.
"But I like my hair blonde," Mihoshi whined.
"Hurts, hurts, calm..."
"Well, okay, if you really want me to," Mihoshi released a breath almost 
like a spoiled child who is reluctantly doing what she is told. She let 
Ryouga go, and calmed down. All the Tenchi group jumped as Mihoshi's blonde 
hair darkened to black. The Nerimans just looked to where Ryouga was trying 
to get his breath back.
"Damn, she's strong," Ranma muttered.
"I like blonde hair," Mihoshi whined holding her hair in front of her face.
"What just happened?" Kiyone asked, everybody was distracted from the 
former discussion. Washu did some quick calculations.
"Hey, its gone!"
"What's gone," Tenchi asked, blinking.
"That energy field around Mihoshi," Washu explained. "The one that I 
always attributed some of her clumsiness to."
"Oh please, like everything that idiot does can be explained by some 
energy field," Kiyone noted.
"I did say SOME, not all, or even MOST," Washu noted. "This is 
interesting."
"Its not fair, me and A-Ko are the fighters," Ryouga grumbled. "And that 
ditz figures it out first?!"
"Come on girls," Nabiki noted. "Shows over and we have our own problems 
to attend to." She waved over the various girls. "You come too, Ranma, this 
has to do with you."
"I think Ryoko and Fam should come as well," Ihrie noted.
"Umm why?" Kiyone asked suddenly nervous.
"Because Fam is Ryoko's mother," Ihrie explained. "And Ryoko had a kid 
with on Xellos Metallium." Kiyone turned a slight shade of green, Nabiki 
noticed.
"Problem, sis?"
"Great, of all the things I didn't want to share with Dad," Kiyone 
muttered. 
"KIYONE!!" Ryoko shouted as everybody looked at her wide-eyed. Nabiki 
and Ayeka smirked.
"Oops, uh, sorry Ryoko," Kiyone laughed, embarrassed.
"It was one time!" Ryoko protested. "I was drunk around Jupiter and she 
pulled me over. Next thing I know I wake up next to her."
"You forgot about karaoke night with me and Mihoshi," Kiyone noted, 
enjoying the teasing now that she could do a little. ~Well if one story is 
out its all coming out.~ 
"Ryo-Chan!" Fam gasped.
"You, and Kiyone?" Tenchi blinked.
"Oh come on, Tenchi," Kiyone said. "You know I can pretty persuasive, 
something a picked up from dad."
"LORD TENCHI!!?"
"Incidentally, that duplication trick of hers is great." Ryoko blushed 
with the renewed attention. "Though Washu has some...interesting skills as 
well."
"What about Ayeka," Ryoko asked, noticing that the princess hadn't been 
mentioned yet.
"What are you implying Ryoko!?" Ayeka snapped.
"Hey, I'm a blood relation of Ayeka's," Kiyone said. Everybody blinked at 
her. "Well, I think so anyway."
"No you are not!!" Ayeka snapped.
"So who haven't you slept with?" Tenchi asked, trying to recover from the 
relevations.
"Sasami and Ayeka," Kiyone admitted. Everybody turned to look at Yosho 
and Nobuyuki who were standing a ways back. "Sasami's way to young."
"I could give you a longer list," Nabiki added dryly, remembering nights 
in a stable trying to escape the noise.
"Wait a minute," Tenchi said, sort of green. "Why are you so disgusted by 
sleeping with the same person as your father, and then go around with MY 
family?"
"I won't be imagining you three as my mother when I go to sleep tonight," 
Kiyone noted. Ryoko thought about that a moment and turned green.
"As you can see," Nabiki coughed. "Our sister Kiyone has inherited some 
of Daddy's....habits."
"If Yohko had more courage," Iako noted snidely. "She'd have a fairly 
long list as well."
"I refuse to believe that I can be related to such a...a...hussy!" Ayeka 
snapped.
"You are," Washu said, revealing a few scans. "The seven of you are all 
at least half-sister to each other."
"Wait a minute," Ranma said. "If you're not really Soun's daughter, then 
the Tendo promise doesn't apply to you!"
"You're HAPPY about that baka!?" Akane shouted.
"Don't you see," Ranma said. "We can get married now because we want 
to...not because of some STUPID agreement." Akane blinked.
"You're right!" Nabiki looked on in mild shock as Akane and Ranma jumped 
up and down happily. "It's OUR decision now!!" This she hadn't expected.
