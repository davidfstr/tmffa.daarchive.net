The War-Chapter 2-"Rescue"
Tenchi and the others go after Kyle to rescue Caleb,but what lies ahead may
be too much for them to handle.By themselves,that is...

Kyle:Sir!Hello.I'm coming back with Caleb.
???:Exellent.Is he alive?
Kyle:Yes.Wounded,but well alive,sir.
???:What about the others?
Kyle:Zero casulties,sir.
???:Well done.
Kyle:Thank you sir.
???:Stop calling me sir!
Kyle:Yes sir!
???:Oh,boy...

******************************************
At Tenchi's place...
******************************************
Ryoko:Brandie,stop this!This is suicidal!
Brandie:I don't care.
Brandie was fixing her Mobile Suit.At least she was trying.It was a wreck.It
was too busted to catch up with Kyle,especially if he was in a Sazabi model.
Ayeka:She's right.This is foolish!We need a plan!
Tenchi:Brandie,once we have a plan,we can...
Brandie:I'm going,whether you like it or not!Washu,can you fix this?
Washu:Well,I don't know,I mean...
Brandie:Yes or no?!
Washu:Yes,but on one condition.
Brandie:I'm not staying.
Washu:That's not it.
Brandie:What then?
Washu:Let us help.Caleb would do the same if it was you with Kyle.You'll
need as much help possible if you want to rescue him.
Brandie:............Alright.But let's hurry please!Who knows how far Kyle is
getting?Or where he's going?
Washu:He's heading for a space sattelite,and he'll get there in thirty
minutes.
Washu had hacked into the Sazabi Kyle was driving and found where he was
going and how long it would take.
Brandie:Can we catch up to him in time?
Washu:Don't worry.I have a plan.Ryo-oki!Come here please!

********************************************
10 minutes later...
********************************************
Ryo-oki was carrying everyone while in her spaceship.The Acguy was pretty
much fixed,but Washu was making adjustments and adding extra stuff to
it.Everyone except Brandie and Washu were in their battle outfits.Brandie
sat on the floor quietly.Ryoko came up to her and rested a hand on her
shoulder.
Ryoko:You really like him,don't you?
Brandie just nodded.
Ryoko:Hey,relax.We'll get him back.
Washu:Show time everybody!There it is!Ryo-oki,attack that ship!And beam
everyone down when I say so!
Ryo-oki:MEOW!
Ryo-oki let a volley (look it up)of lazers.They were mostly blocked,but a
few scored hits.
Tenchi:Let's review the plan.Washu,Sasami and Ryo-oki will distract them
from the outside.Then,me,Ryoko,Ayeka,Azaka,Komidake,Josh and Brandie will be
beamed inside,where we will find Caleb,and destroy the core.Then,we will be
beamed back into Ryo-oki and leave.Then BOOM.Everyone know there parts?
Everyone:Yep!
Tenchi:Well,let's go!
Washu:Now,Ryo-oki!
Ryo-oki:Meow!
The next thing everyone knew,they were inside.Unfortunatly,they were in the
Mobile Suit docking bay.Ryoko,Ayeka,Azaka and Komidake went wild,destroying
and dodging Moblie Suits left and right.Tenchi chopped several of their legs
off,then chopped off their heads.Brandie,now in the Acguy,leaped on
several,destroying them,doing whatever her mind could think of to annihalate
them,powered by rage.Josh was in a Gouf,destroying two times as many as the
others were combined. When they stopped,they all were panting hard.Brandie
activated her speakers so the others could her what she had to say.
Brandie:Oops...
Ryoko:What?
Brandie:My sensors show no one was in here.
Tenchi:Oopsy...
Brandie:Well,at least we destroyed their Mobile Suits!Now,we'll have less
people resisting us.
Josh:What about Kyle?
Brandie:Oh,don't worry.I'll take care of him...
Josh:We've got company!It's...oh my...
Tenchi:What is it?
Josh:It's Mobile Armor...
Brandie:Big deal.How many?
Josh:Three.
Brandie:Oh,sh**.
Josh:Alright,me and Ryoko will stay here and fight these things.The rest of
you keep going.
Brandie:But...
Josh:Just go!Hurry up and find Caleb!Let's just hope he's still alive...

******************************************
In a holding cell...
******************************************
Caleb woke up and wished he hadn't.Emense pain came from his back.Blood was
covering his side.He got up VERY slowly.The last thing he remembered was a
sharp pain in his back,then falling.He tried breaking the door open,but that
didn't work.He sat back on the ground.About ten minutes later,two guards
came and grabbed him by the arms.They dragged him towards who knows
where.Caleb's legs were being dragged on the floor,which would work to his
advantage,he figured.
Caleb:Where are you taking me?
Guard 1:To see the boss.
Caleb:Who is he?
Guard 2:We can't tell you.
Caleb:That's all I needed to know.Thank you.
He did a frontflip,(with his arms still being held.)kicked them in the
head,then bashed their heads together.When they passed out,they released his
arms.He landed on his hands and did a cartwheel to land on his feet.
Caleb:Sleep well,but don't wake up too soon.Now,to find a Mobile Suit and
get out of here.
Caleb started to jog,but fell to the ground in pain.He crawled back to the
guards to search them for anything to take this pain away.Sure enough,he
found a med-pack.He applied them to his back and took some aspirin.Feeling
better,he grabbed their weapons and their keys and headed off.He had also
found a map.He figured if he knocked out enough guards,he would have enough
gunpowder and explosives to blow the core away.He took a deep breath and
headed down the long corridor.

******************************************
Meanwhile,in the Mobile Suit dock...
******************************************
Josh and Ryoko had already destroyed one of them,the Big Zam.Now,the only
two left were the Nueziel and the Psycho Gundam.But,that doesn't mean that
it will be easy.That just means that's one less Mobile Armor to deal with.
Josh:Ryoko!I see a weak spot on the Psycho Gundam!Keep Nueziel busy!
Ryoko:Gottya!
Ryoko fired two blasts at Nueziel's side.He just looked at Ryoko.From under
one of his "wings",came a thin arm,with a beam saber.He flew at her,swinging
and swiping.Ryoko flew through a wall.Nueziel flew through the wall;only the
wall was destroyed when he went through.They were now in outer space.Ryoko
teleported away from most of his attacks and countered them with energy
blasts.Nueziel pulled out another arm,and,like the Hy-Gogg,(Read the last
chapter!)gunfire cam out of its open palm.After a while,it finally hit
Ryoko.She fell
and hit the sattelite.She turned around and saw Nueziel.A small...thing...on
his stomach started to draw in energy.Ryoko knew that he was powering up.But
before she could move,Nueziel reached its arms out and held her arms
down.She was too weak and couldn't concentrate enough to teleport.Before he
fired,his head blew right off.In its place,was...
Yagami!
Ryoko:Hey.Though they were on another assignment...
Ryoko pushed Nueziel off and flew off into the Yagami.When she got to the
cockpit,sure enough,she found Kiyone and Mihoshi.
Ryoko:Hey!Boy am I glad to see you two!Thanks for that one!
Mihoshi:You're welcome!
Ryoko:So how did you guys know?Wait,let me guess:Washu.
Kiyone:Yeah,Washu told us when you guys went inside.
Mihoshi:So,where to?
Ryoko:We're here to find Caleb.He's in there somewhere.Let's find him.
*******************************************
Meanwhile,in the docking bay...
*******************************************
Josh:Alright,let's see what you're made of!
Josh charged at the Psycho Gundam.It ran at him.At the last second,the Gouf
leaped to the side and lifted up his left arm and fired his gatling gun.It
hit the left side of the Mobile Armor's side.It didn't appear to do much
damage.It just swiped at the Gouf.It would have hit the gatling gun and
damaged the Gouf,but at the last second,he detached the gatling gun.And
now,you could see its arm.It looked entirely normal,except for the 4 small
barrels at the wrist.It exploded and deativated the beam
saber.Meanwhile,Josh leaped up and landed on the back of his
neck.Unfortunatly,the back coolers hit him right where the camera was
located,blowing it right off.But even worse,it shut down his radar,his
infared,and his visual camera.He was as blind as a bat.Well,actually,bats
aren't really blind.See,they...never mind.
Josh:Blast it!How can I see?I know!
Josh opened the cockpit door.And was greeted by a fist.It smashed right in
the cockpit.Fortunatly,the Psycho Gundam's fingers had a little space
between them.Just enough space that Josh was still in one piece.He shut the
door twice as fast as he opened it.
Josh:Well,that didn't work as well as I thought.
Emily:Need some help?
A Mobile Suit jumped out and punched the Psycho in the head.It was a MS-18E
Kaempfer,to be exact.It pulled a shotgun from its holster and fired four
rounds.Each one hit their target,but did little damage.The Psycho Gundam
leaped into the air and body-slammed the Kaempfer into the ground.It
fell,hard and fast.It could hardly move,but it still had power.
Josh:Well,long time no see,Emily.
Emily was under Josh's command at one point,but during a mission,it was
believed she had died from a space mine while in the mission.Josh took it
pretty hard,since the two of them had been...close.To this day,I'm not sure
if he still loves her,but you shall see soon.
Emily:Yeah.But family reunions later.I can't move!
Josh:I can't see!Wait,Emily,do you still have visuals?
Emily:Yeah,but...oh,I see.It's a long shot,but we can try.
Josh:And...go!
The Gouf stood up and ran at the Psycho Gundam.The pilot was suprised;he
didn't think it would still be attacking if he was blind.But little did he
know,Josh wasn't blind.Not at all...
Emily:Gunfire!Head east of your position!
Josh did as she said,and sure enough,the bullets went right by.Then Josh
opened up a small compartment in the Gouf's left arm and out came a whip,but
rather than a spike at the end,it was just flat.He pulled the Gouf's arm
back and whipped it forward.It wrapped around the Psycho Gundam's neck and
then he pulled him up.The Gouf landed on his back.
Emily:Good!Now,release the whip and then move it in the exact directions I
say!
Josh did as he was told,as the rod recoiled back.Emily gave Josh a number of
orders,all of which he followed.In the end,the flat end of the whip
connected with a small...thing on the top of Psycho's head.
Emily:NOW!
Josh:Hope this works!
Josh pressed a button and electricity flew from where the whip and the
Psycho's head connected.The Psycho tried fighting back,but was losing power
fast.Soon,the whip finished it's job,as the Psycho's power was shut down.
Emily:Good,but it's still standing!I'm going to toss you my gun.Try to catch
it with your right hand.
The Kaemfer tossed it's shotgun,but before it could reach,an explosion
rocked the room.Both Mobile Suits were knocked off their feet.
Josh:What the?!
Emily:Hold your horses,let me check the source!Oh,man.We gotta get outta
here!
Josh:What is it?
Emily:The core has been disrupted!It will blow within half an hour!
Josh:How?We had a plan!This is much too soon!
Emily:Well,let's go!
Suddenly,a hole was blown in the nearby wall.Outside was the Yagami.
Kiyone:Hey,hop on board!
Mihoshi:We need to go!
Josh:Who are you?
Kiyone:Friends of Tenchi.Now let's go!
The Yagami fired a cable,which Josh grabbed onto.He grabbed hold of the
Kaemfer and soon,they were both on board.
Washu(over intercom):We need to alert the others!
Kiyone:Already did.They're on their way.Wierd thing is,they weren't inside
of the core.
Washu:What?
Ryoko:Yeah,none of them were even close to the core.It must be someone else!
Washu:Hold on!
Washu,being the genius she is,hacked into the satellite's security
system.She opened up the file holding the controls for the cameras.She
scrolled through them and found one inside of the core room.
Brandie(over intercom):So who IS the intruder?
She opened it up and saw the intruder.
Washu:It's Caleb.He's attaching explosives to the core!
Brandie:What?!Well,we have to go back for him!
Washu:The countdown is at fifteen minutes!There isn't enough time!
Brandie:Oh,yes there is!
With that,she shut off her communication line.She knew it was suicide,but
she had to try.Brandie turned her Mobile Suit around and headed towards the
core.It was pretty easy,considering most of the walls had been blown
away.When she reached the core,a Mobile Suit was standing right in front of
her.She was about to attack when she saw the power light wasn't on,meaning
it wasn't active.She ran past it and found Caleb,applying the last few
explosives to the main core.Brandie turned on her speaker to try and get
Caleb's attention.
Brandie:Caleb!
That sure worked,because Caleb turned right around,gun drawn.When he saw the
Acguy,he lowered his gun.
Caleb:Brandie?How did you...?
Brandie:Never mind that!The place is going to blow in God knows how long.We
have to leave!
Caleb:It's a bluff.The computer just disposed of the walls and rooms that
were non-essential and put a countdown drive was installed into it,but not
any old countdown drive.It's designed to stop just before the
explosion.Their only bluffing.I've set explosives so that we have plenty of
time to leave.
Brandie:How do you know?
Caleb:I hacked into the mainframe.So relax.
Brandie:I love you,but I'm about two seconds away from knocking you out and
dragging you out of this hel...
BOOM!!
A wall instantly exploded,sending shards of metal all over the place.Brandie
only needed to raise an arm to shield herself,but Caleb wasn't as lucky.He
wasn't in a Mobile Suit and had no protection,so when he raised an arm to
shield himself,a shard of metal slashed him in the left arm.He lost his
balance and fell off of the platform he was on.He did a backflip and tried
landing on his feet,but he was too high up.He landed on his feet,but fell on
his side as soon as he hit the ground.He cried out in pain as his right leg
was dislocated in an instant.
Brandie:Caleb!Are you alright?
Caleb:Just peachy...
He reached up with his hands and placed it on his right thigh.It felt like
his left arm weighed 100 tons,as he lifted it up to his injured
leg.Then,gripping it tightly,he pulled his leg away from his body.Not long
afterward,a POP sound could be heard.At that moment,he twisted it
slightly,and a softer 'Pop' sound could be heard.He relaxed,but it was short
lived.By using his left arm,he only made it bleed faster.He rolled onto his
side and gritted his teeth to ease his pain,but to no prevail.
Brandie:Are you alright?
Caleb:Yeah,except for my arm...
????:Well,then you won't be much of a challenge,will you?
Both of them turned to see a Mobile Suit standing in the hole made from
earlier.
A Sazabi model.
Brandie:Kyle!
Kyle:Yep.Caleb,you have caused a lot of trouble,and I'm here to get rid of
you.
Brandie:I won't let you get to him!You'll have to beat me first!
Kyle:A waste of time.But,if it will get me to Caleb,I'll do it.Prepare to
die!
Brandie:We'll see!
Brandie launched the Acguy at Kyle's Sazabi.He easily dodged it and hit her
in the side with the sharp end of his shield.
Acguy fell hard,but got right back up.But when she did,Kyle was gone.She
checked her infared and couldn't find him.
Then,from the ceiling,Kyle lunged.He was about to body slam the Acguy,but
Brandie already knew he was above her.
Purple claws extended from the Acguy's hands and then,Brandie turned around
and slashed the Sazabi.It struck home,as the Sazabi was slashed in the chest
deeply.But Brandie didn't stop there;she lifted her claws up and shook them
menacingly,then she jumped at Kyle,claws first.It hit him in the right
arm,and as soon as the claws dug into it,the claws drilled further.Kyle
reached up and hit her away with his other arm.She did a backflip and landed
on her feet,claws withdrawn.The two of them stood there for a
while,pondering who whould attack next.
Kyle:Well,you're more experienced than I thought.
Brandie:Well,you're a lot weaker than I thought!
Kyle:Time to put an end to this.Take this!
A back compartment opened up on the Sazabi's back,and out came three small
robots,shaped like funnels,with three wings coming out of the rear.A small
blaster was on the tip of the front.Kyle ran at Brandie.She punched him in
the face after sidestepping a stab from the shield,but the Funnels attacked
at the same time.They flew behind Brandie and shot at her several times.It
didn't do too much damage,but it gave Kyle the advantage he needed.He pulled
out a small double-headed axe and sliced several times.Each one struck
home,as Brandie was cut severally.As she fell,she lifted her right hand and
opened fire on the Funnels.All three were hit,and exploded on impact.Brandie
tried getting up but a foot stepped on the Acguy's back.Sazabi pulled out a
gun and shot her relentlessly until the gun was out of ammo.He stabbed her
with the shield and then he picked her up and leaned her against a wall.He
took a few steps back and right below the cockpit was a small jewel,which is
now glowi!
ng.
Kyle:Say goodbye!
Rapid energy shots erupted from his stomach.About six seconds later,he
stopped.He called out ten Funnels,just in case.When the smoke
cleared,Brandie was gone.In her place was a few feathers floating around.
Kyle:Huh?Did I totally annihalate her out of existence?No,couldn't be,the
wall is still intact.But she was too damaged to move fast enough to dodge
it,so where is she?
Suddenly,his radar picked up something.It told him Brandie was right behind
him.He turned,ready to fight,but wasn't ready for what he saw.
The Acguy was there all right,but it was being held in the arms of another
Mobile Suit.
Kyle:What the...Hey,what model is that?
He punched in a few keys to see what the name of this new enemy was.The
computer was searching and searching,but it just came up UNKNOWN MOBILE
SUIT.
Kyle:Who are you?
Caleb:What's the matter?Don't recognize your old friend Caleb?
Kyle:Caleb?Where did you get that Mobile Suit?
Caleb:This is what you came for.My heritage.
Kyle:You mean...
Caleb:Yes.This is the Wing Zero Custom Mobile Suit.
Kyle:Give me that Mobile Suit!
Caleb:You want it?Come and get it.
Kyle lunged at Caleb.At the last second,with the Acguy still in his arms,he
used his wings and in one single flap,he was gone in a flash.The Sazabi
stopped and tried to find Caleb.He found him up on top of a platform,setting
the Acguy down.
Kyle:Coward!Come down here and fight like a man!
Caleb:I wouldn't rush this fight if I were you.
Kyle:Why not?
Caleb:Zero tells me you will die in less than one minute.
Kyle:"Zero told you"?Mobile Suits have no emotions,feelings,or minds!
Caleb:Don't waste your breath.
Kyle:Make me!
Sazabi flew at the Wing Zero Custom.He pulled out his axe and stabbed Caleb
right below the chest.Caleb didn't flinch in the least.Sazabi fell over,with
a hole in a stomach.At the last moment,Caleb had pulled a beam saber from
his back and held it so that when Kyle stabbed him,he ran right into the
saber.
Kyle:Bu...but why?
Caleb:A soldier's life has no meaning unless you're willing to give it up
for a purpose.A person shouldn't rush blindlessly into battle unless he
knows today is the day he will die.Wars have no meaning.Why must I be forced
to take lives when death can be avoided?
Josh:Nice speach,but we gotta get outta here!One of the Funnels activated
the explosives you set!We've got five minutes!
The Wing Zero Custom picked up the Acguy and flew over to where the Yagami
was now.He dropped her inside of it,then flew back to the core.
Ryoko:What the heck do you think you're doing?!
Washu:She's right!You'll be killed!
Caleb:If that bomb detonates,everyone will be killed.
Ayeka:They are the enemy!It doesn't matter!
Caleb:Enemy or not,they are still people.They have homes,loved ones,and
families,just like we do.We are identical,we just have different points of
view.
The Wing Zero Custom landed in the core room.Josh landed next to him.
Josh:You're going to need some help.
Caleb:Thank you.
The others tried to help them,but a fire erupted out of the
entrance,preventing them from reaching them.
Josh:How are we going to do this?
Caleb:Zero has a plan.
Josh:Who's "Zero"?
Caleb:Josh,you use your machete to disconnect the bombs from their holding
places,but be careful;if you disconnect one of them wrong,they'll all
detonate in ten seconds.I made them that way.Put them in a pile over
there.I'll take them away from this place.Do it.Now!
Josh:Right!
Josh jumped towards the first one and disconnected it from the core.Caleb
flew around,putting out fires that could cause the bombs to explode.
Caleb:We have two and a half minutes left.
Josh:That doesn't really help much!Oh,shoot!Blast it!I messed up!They're
going to explode!
Caleb:Let's get out of here!
8...
Caleb and Josh flew towards the entrance.
7...
A beam fell and hit Caleb,pinning his Mobile Suit's legs.
6...
He pulls a beam saber out and cuts the beam off of him.
5...
Josh is now inside the Yagami.
4...
Caleb goes back for the explosives that Josh had successfuly dismantled.
3...
He scoopes them up.
2...
He flies towards the exit.Caleb(Thinking):I'm not going to make it!
1...
Then,Zero motivates Caleb's mind.FLASH!Suddenly,Caleb is in front of
Tenchi's house.He is sitting on a rock,and next to him,is Brandie.She
smiles,and Caleb realizes what Zero is doing.Zero is reminding him that he
will never see Brandie again if he doesn't make it.And to Caleb,that is
worse than dying.FLASH!Caleb's determination and his love for Brandie is
transported into the Wing Zero's wings,probably by God himself.The Mobile
Suit just barely made it.As the explosives detonated,fire danced around
Caleb.But it was too late,Caleb had made it out and was flying to the
Yagami.Caleb sighed loudly and suddenly,he remembered his left arm's gash.He
grunted in pain,but was relieved nonetheless.When he borded Yagami,he found
no one there to greet him.So,he climbed out of his Mobile Suit and headed to
the cockpit.And,sure enough,everyone was there.
Tenchi:You made it!
Josh:Welcome back!
Ryoko:I would have never beleived it if I haven't seen it.
Ayeka:On behalf of Planet Jurai,I congratulate you.
Kiyone:Well done,kid.
Sasami:You're alright!
Mihoshi:I would have never made it!
Ryo-oki:Meow!
Washu:You scared us all to death!
Caleb:Thank you!Hey,where's Brandie?
Tenchi:I think she said she was going to rest.
Washu:I made her her own quarters.She'll be fine.There's a room next to hers
with your name on it!There is a healing chamber in there that will heal that
wound of yours.
Caleb:Thank you.
Tenchi:Well,I think we should head home.
All:Oh,yeah!
Ryoko:Let's celebrate!I'll get the drinks!
All:Yeah!A party!
Caleb:You're very kind,but I need to rest first.I'll be back soon.
Josh:Sure you will.
Caleb:What's that supposed to mean?
Ryoko:He's right.I've got a feeling you won't be back for quite a while!
Everyone except Caleb starts laughing.Caleb just blushes.
Caleb:Whatever.I'll be right back.
He walks out of the room,red as a cherry.
Caleb:I need a vacation...
He finds his room,takes his shoes off,opens the healing chamber,and lies
down inside.Five minutes later,his arm feels better than ever.
Caleb:Wow,that was fast.
He plops down on his bed and falls asleep for about half an hour.He would
have slept longer,but he was woken up by Ryoko.
Caleb:Huh?Ryoko?What is it?
Ryoko:You STILL haven't talked to her?Good grief!She doesn't even know
you're back yet.You should just go talk to her.
Caleb:No way!
Ryoko:Well,if you won't go and talk to her,I'll make you!
With that,she grabbed him by the arm and teleported him into Brandie's
room.She dissappeared instantly.
Caleb:She'll be sorry she ever did that.
Brandie:Ahh!
Ryoko probably  did this on purpose,but maybe not.She dropped Caleb in
Brandie's room,but unfortunatly,Brandie was getting dressed.
Caleb:Oh,man!
Caleb was as shy as Tenchi was,so he ran into the living room.His face was
redder than magma.A few moments later,Brandie came out,but with clothes on.
Brandie:What are you doing here?
Caleb:Ryoko brought me here to talk to you.
Brandie:What about?
Caleb:.......Are you alright?
Brandie:Yeah,but(blushing,comes over and sits on Caleb's lap.)I could use
one of your massages.
Caleb:Well,okay.
Caleb set his hands on her shoulders and started to rub them.
Brandie:Little higher...
Caleb did as she asked,and added a little more pressure to his
rubbing.Brandie moaned in pleasure as every muscle in her started to
relaxe.Caleb just smiled.
Caleb:I'm enjoying this almost as much as you are.
Brandie:How's that?
Caleb:Well,look at us.You're sitting on my lap,and I'm massaging your
shoulders.
Brandie:I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Caleb:Oh,I am.
They fell silent for a little while,not knowing what to say.Except for
Brandie's occasional requests.Finally,Caleb leaned into her ear and
whispered something to her.
Caleb:You know,your shoulders aren't the only things I can massage.
Brandie gasped and blushed at the same time.Slowly,she turned around to look
at him.He had stopped massaging her shoulders,but she didn't mind.In
fact,she could barely tell the difference.Although his right hand was still
on her shoulder,though.His hand lifted off her shoulder and gently felt her
left cheek.It was as soft as newly-sown quilt,softer even.He leaned into her
and their lips met as he did so.Their love for each other was as strong as
Ryoko's love for Tenchi.
Although Caleb was really shy most of the time,he took the offensive this
time.He gently laid her down onto the couch,without breaking the kiss.The
two of them kissed for quite a while,not able to stop.Finally,Brandie broke
the kiss by lifting Caleb's lips off of hers.The two lovers stared into each
other's eyes,as if lost in a deep light,but not wanting to leave.
Brandie:Caleb?
Caleb:Yes?
Brandie:Do that again.
Caleb(chuckles):As you wish.
Again,the two of them embraced one another.After about two minutes of
kissing,it was Brandie's turn for the offensive.She slipped her tongue into
his mouth and started searching for Caleb's tongue.And she found it all
right!They kissed for quite a while,until Caleb stopped.
Brandie:What's wrong?
Caleb reached into his back pocket and pulled a gun out.Without aiming,he
lifted it to his left and fired.Brandie looked to her right and found a
small robot with a video camera.After that,Caleb holstered the weapon.
Brandie:Washu?
Caleb:That would be my guess.
Brandie:What?You like your privacy?
Caleb:You could say that.
Brandie:Well,for what I have in store for you,you're going to need your
privacy!
Caleb:Oh?And what exactly do you have in store for me?
Brandie gets out from under Caleb and pushes him down so that now,he's the
one lying down on the couch.Brandie smiles.
Brandie:You'll see...
