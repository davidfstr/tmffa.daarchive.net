Author's Note 

	This story will single out three of my favorite animes namely Dragon Ball 
Z, Ranma 1/2, and Sailor Moon along with several appearences of other animes I 
like. I combined my three favorites into one world, it's basically an alternate 
reality, crossover, self-insertion fic. Many of the characters are totally out of 
character, Akane in particular because she's the main character and she's the 
cause of this whole thing, by wishing for it.
	I basically seperated the series into three sagas the first is called the 
World Martial Arts Tournament, the second is called the Enemies Rebirth Saga. The 
Enemies Rebirth Saga will be basically this, Kagato is alive (the reason's will 
be brought to light in the series) and finds Dr. Gero's laboratory plus he finds 
Gero's android molds and kidnaps Ryoga, Kuno, and Mousse. He uses the Dragon 
Balls to give Ryoga, Frieza's evil spirit and power level, Mousse is given Majin 
Buu, and Kuno is given Cell's spirit and power level.
	When it's finished I hope it kicks ass, especially after Tenchi and Ryoko 
are together in this series and are one of the main characters in the Enemies 
Rebirth Saga and the third saga called Dragon's Bane. Tenchi and Ryoko in this 
series are from the OVA series, as for the other characters from Tenchi Muyo! I 
haven't decided what to do.

Disclaimer: I didn't create any of the anime characters in this fan fiction.  

Prologue (part 1)
The Arrival of Brad

	Bradford Fitzgerald Wall, sixteen year old high school student 
was looking around a large grassy field he found himself on. He was 
wondering how he got there or where he was for that matter. That was 
until he saw a bright light flash up in the sky, he turned toward the 
light and saw a man in the sky firing some sort of energy beam at 
something on the ground. Brad quickly ran in that direction, as he saw 
a follow up energy blast head straight at the man and caused the man to 
fall out of the sky.

	Goku fell to the ground and Raditz ran to him, then slammed his 
big giant sized boot into Goku's stomach. Raditz smiled cruelly looking 
up at Piccolo as Piccolo froze in place. "Come on, green man why don't 
you try that trick of yours 
again."
	Piccolo trembled slightly. "I can't, there isn't enough time." 
he mumbled to himself.
	Raditz looked down and his smile widen considerably. "Farewell 
brother!" he shouted and lunge forward preparing to kill Goku, when 
his scouter went off. "What power level 1000, where?" he said looking 
around. 
	Gohan then appeared crashing through Raditz's space pod, Raditz, 
Goku, and Piccolo watched as Gohan do a flip in mid air and land. "So 
you taught the kid a few tricks, huh, Kakkarot?" Raditz said
	"Run, Gohan get out of here!" Goku shouted. Instead Gohan 
suddenly exploded in energy and flew at Raditz. Gohan head butted 
Raditz in the chest before crashing to the ground.

	Brad finally arrived on the scene and saw watched as a kid 
slammed his head into the chest area of a large man dressed in armor. 
He already judge this guy was basically unpleasant seeing one person 
on the ground and a strange green skinned man with one arm missing. 
Brad could safely judge this guy as bad, so he ran at the large man as 
the man turned toward kid clutching his chest.

	Raditz cursed the kid and knocked the kid away, clutching at his 
chest. <He was the first one to ever hurt me like this, if he ever 
learned to control his powers he would be an incredible nuisance>. 
Raditz thought walking toward Gohan, as he was about to finish the 
little kid off. A huge force slam against him, knocking him off his 
feet, back toward where Goku laid. Raditz quickly stood up and turn to 
see someone new had entered the fight. It wasn't anybody from Goku's 
group of friends that he saw eariler from the island. Raditz reach up 
and turned on his scouter, he then gasp in surprise. "Power level 1500. 
How is that possible?"
	Brad stared at the large man questionably, before bending down 
and picked up the kid. He then carted the small kid closer to the green 
skinned man, he then turned and saw the downed man holding the larger 
man in a full-nelson. "Now Piccolo!" the man said.
	The green skinned man smiled darkly and brought up two of fingers, 
lightning started sparking from these points. The sparks grew intensely, 
forming an almost yellow aura. "Man, Goku your something else, hold on 
a second and don't believe anything he says." Piccolo stated, as Brad 
stood quietly not knowing what to do.
	"Is there anything I can do?" Brad asked.
	Piccolo glanced at the young man standing next to him. "No, just 
stay put you'll just get in the way." he said.
	Brad nodded and stepped back out of the line of fire still 
clutching the young kid closely to him. He watched as the green man 
known as Piccolo, finished charging up his attack, as he heard the big 
man spitting words at the one called Goku. "It's ready Goku." Piccolo 
stated. "SPECIAL BEAM CANNON, FIRE!" Piccolo shouted and a corkscrew 
style energy beam headed straight at Goku and the big man. The beam 
impacted the armor went through and out the back of the two men. 
Both were flung back and crashed to the ground.
	Brad stood there stunned by the violence of the blast, but 
somewhere deep inside him knew there was no other choice in such an 
eventuality. He ran over to Goku and bent down to examine the man.
	Goku opened his eyes and stared up at the young man who saved his 
son's life. "Thank you, for saving my son."
	Brad smiled weakly gently laying the kid down. "Least I could 
do."

	A few seconds later all three of them heard a jet engine fly by. 
Brad watched still holding the child, who was starting to get a little 
heavy. The strange aircraft circled about before landing not far away. 
Brad then watched as Piccolo picked up a hat and cape then put them on, 
Brad looked down at Goku wondering what he could do.
	"Goku, Goku!" yelled a bald headed short man wearing clothing 
identical to Goku's followed closely by a shorter pig creature, an old 
man, and beautiful woman with sea-green hair. 
	"Who are you?" asked the woman.
	"Uh, my name is Bradford Wall, I woke up not far from here and 
saw a major fight going down badly so I came to help," he paused 
handing the child to her.
	"Is it true, Goku?" the bald headed man asked.
	"Yes, he saved Gohan's life," Goku replied, "I already thanked 
him, Krillin."
	Brad watched as Krillin turned away and went back to his dying 
friend. Brad quietly walked up to the dead man and bent down. The 
man's eyes shot open, Brad quickly slammed a foot down on the throat 
of the man. He then picked up the device over the ear, and brought it 
back over to the group examining the device. He found what appeared to
be communication device attach to it. He place the device over his ear 
and heard someone on the other end.

	"Raditz what an idiot, now we have to dirty our hands on that 
backwater planet," a harsh voice stated.
	"Do we really have to, Vegeta?" another asked.
	"Yes Nappa, if we don't Frieza will find out, if he hasn't 
already," Vegeta replied.
	Nappa grunted as he and Vegeta stepped into their space pods. 
"How long will it take to get there?"
	"A year, remember we have make that stop in the Arlia system 
along the way," Vegeta said as the pod doors closed. "Raditz that 
weakling, those two had power level below five hundred, even one of 
the Sybamen could taken them out by itself."
	"He didn't take in a count the fact that Kakarot's son or that 
other man would get involved," Nappa answered.
	"I suppose that is possible, but it still doesn't matter. We 
still have to clean up his mess," Vegeta snorted.

	Brad hit the only button on the device and the voices stopped. 
"Damn, two more are coming to finish what this guy started," he 
mumbled walking over to the group who were now mourning the passing 
of their friend.
	Piccolo was the only other person who heard the conversation, 
that was played over the device. "So it's not over is it?" he asked 
Brad as he walked up.
	"Nope, listen we have one year before two more like the guy you 
and Goku fought arrive. But, if I'm right, these guys are hundred 
times stronger than gruesome over there," Brad said as the others 
listen in.
	"Your sure about this?" Krillin asked.
	"One second, I need to check something," Brad stated then went 
into series of complicated katas and after finishing smiled briefly. 
"More sure now then a couple of seconds ago."
	The woman stared at him oddly. "Well, what do we do next?"
	Brad crossed his arms and looked at Piccolo. "I don't know 
what's going on, so what do you think?"
	"We train to get stronger, and prepare for their arrival," 
Piccolo said then everyone turned as they heard old man gasp. 
	"Goku disappeared," Krillin shouted.
	"Don't worry, Kami took him," Piccolo replied.

	Brad watched quietly as Piccolo and Goku's friends as they 
started bickering about Goku's son Gohan. Piccolo ended the fight by 
taking the boy under his arm and flying off. Krillin and the old man 
named Muten Roshi both looked at each other with sweat on the bald 
heads. "What do we tell Chi Chi?" Roshi asked Krillin just heaved a 
sigh of defeat. Brad snorted a bit turning away to his disbelief 
lifted himself into the air almost without a thought.
	"I'll see you guys in a year, wouldn't want to miss this fight," 
Brad stated flying off in an unpredetermined direction thinking to 
himself. <Where am I, and how can I do these things and why can't 
remember anything prior to popping up on that fight. Damnit, I hate it 
when I don't know what's going on.> 

	In another place hidden in the time streams sat Sailor Pluto and 
Goddess Belledandy. Both watched Brad as he flew toward Tokyo. "Are 
you positive he would be a better father to Ranma than Genma?" Pluto 
asked.
	Belledandy nodded with a soft smile. "Anybody would be a better 
father to Ranma than Genma Saotome. Akane's wish was that Ranma to 
have a better father than Genma, she said nothing about her parents 
promise to unite the Anything Schools of Martial Arts. Which leads 
me to believe that she wanted the engagement."
	"So what's the reason of having Brad go through all the events 
involving Goku and company?" Pluto asked.
	"It's to build him up for a threat that will involve the 
Z-fighters and the Sailor Scouts I'm afraid," Belledandy responded. 
"There's another reason for it, Brad Wall is also the father of 
Sailor Mars, and Nodoka Saotome will be the mother."
	Pluto spit out her tea. "Why didn't you say so, in the first 
place?"
	Belledandy smiled demurely. "I forgot to do so."

	Brad sneezed as he floated over Tokyo. <Hmm, I have one year to 
get faster and stronger before those two aliens geeks show up. Where 
can I train.> He looked around and found a large complex just below 
the horizon that had a dojo. He landed in front of the complex and 
rang the doorbell. The door open five minutes later, a young girl 
roughly two years younger than himself open the door and stared at 
him blankly.
	Brad bowed in respect of the intrusion, and quickly asked if he 
could borrow the dojo to train for the up coming fight. The girl was 
Nodoka Saotome, current head of the Saotome Clan of Anything Goes 
Martial Arts. Listen intently trying to pick up any signs of being 
decieved, finding none she let him in. Brad quietly listened as Nodoka 
showed him around, and described her family hertitage. He found it 
very interesting, he also found out that she was in engaged to another
clan member, Genma Saotome. Brad was then led to the dojo where, looked 
around at the various objects in the room. Most were weapons, armor, 
or books filled techniques to learn. Nodoka told him that as head of 
the clan she had say over who got to use the books. Brad nodded and 
stood in the middle of the dojo, closing his eyes. Nodoka left knowing 
he wouldn't touch anything unless he asked.

	So began Brad's adventures training quietly in the Saotome dojo 
for twelve months, learning various techniques, making his own chi 
attacks, which also bordered on elementals like fire, water, and 
earth. He also trained using extreme gravity enhancing clothing, 
weighing way over even Goku's standard weights. When finished he said 
goodbye, to his newest friend Nodoka and promised her after everything 
was settled he would see her again.
	The next three years were the most difficult for after leaving 
Nodoka. He helped the Z-fighters defend against Nappa and Vegeta 
getting severely injured during the fight. After two months of healing 
with Gohan and Krillin, he volunteered to go with them and Bulma to 
planet Namek to search for the Dragon Balls. Once arriving on Namek 
he was caught up in the battle against the Ginyu Force. Where he and 
Gohan tried to fight off Racoom only to beaten within inch of there 
life, just in time for Goku to arrive and shift the fight. Brad 
then later went one on one with Frieza after Piccolo was unable to beat 
him. Brad held Frieza off until the evil tyrant went to his third 
transformation. After killing Dende and holding a dying Vegeta, Goku 
arrived to shift the fight again and this time held the fight. The 
fight was long and causing massive destruction to the country side. 
Brad, Krillun, Piccolo, and Gohan watched as Goku went toe to toe with 
the alien tyrant. Goku used the spirit bomb. After Piccolo was severely 
injured and the death of Krillun, Goku went Super Saiyen. Brad and 
Gohan watch in amazement, but Brad quickly got Gohan to leave carrying 
Piccolo, to allow Goku to fight on his own.
	A year later after the events on Namek, ending with it's 
destruction and Frieza's apparent demise life seem to get back normal 
only to have Garlic Junior intervene. Brad was busy training on Mount 
Everest at it's peek so the Dark Water mist missed him by a good twelve 
miles. So he had no idea what happened during that time except for a 
few fluxations of combat power levels. Then came Frieza's return only 
this time he was to arrive on Earth. Brad and the others flew to where 
they roughly estimated Frieza's arrival point. By that time Brad found 
an outfit that suited him. Black leather trench coat, black gi pants,
red weighted training gi with black over shirt, weighted boots, and 
flingerless gloves(think about Goku's fighting outfit during the 
Cell Games).
	They all sense future Trunks fight Frieza and King Cold, and win 
then tell them about the androids. Brad returns to the Saotome dojo, 
and reunites with the now married Nodoka. There he trains using a 
gravity generator like Goku and Vegeta use. A year before the time 
of the Androids arrival during his training,  he hears that Genma dies 
of a strange heart disease. He help's console Nodoka'sloss. Over the 
next year he alternates between training and comforting his 
friend. Two months after her husband's death, Nodoka is showing signs 
that she is pregnant, and after a doctor's visit it was confirmed. 
Nodoka fearing that her child will be without a father she asks Brad 
to marry her six day's later. Aeight months later Ranma Saotome is born, 
twelve days before the Cell Games are about to be announce.
