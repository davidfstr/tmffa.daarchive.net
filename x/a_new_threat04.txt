                              A New Threat
                               Chapter 4

     Tenchi and the others gathered in Washu's lab to see what she had in
mind. Kiyone and Mihoshi were in the living room piecing together what
was going on. Washu was in some sort of General outfit with a bunch of
medals on the left side. She had a screen behind her and a pointer in 
her hand.

     "I have found a couple of ways we can do this," she started out, "One,
we can use the primitive manner of launching a missile at it..."

     "Wait a minute. We've already tried that before!" interupted Cloud.

     Cloud's eyes gaped wide at the weight he had on his head. Washu had
dropped a pot full of soil on it. Cloud was expected to balance it. Ryoko
sniggered at him. But her enjoyment was halted when a statue fell on her head.

     "Now, if we don't have anymore interuptions," said Washu, " we can
continue with the briefing. We can primitivly launch a missile at Meteor,
but not at the surface."

     The room went dark. The screen behind Washu lit up with a diagram of
Meteor. Washu went on explaining about cavities and central cores when she
pointed out that there was a passagway leading into the heart of Meteor.

     "We can launch a Armageddon class nuclear warhead into the central core
of Meteor and blow the thing to Hell." Washu explained.

     "Well that might work..." started Tenchi, but he was interupted by Cloud

     "Meteor will just pull itself back together!"

     "Not with the missile design I've made up. I detected traces of nickel
and iron. That means Meteor is metallic and therefore, is attracted to magnets.
It's probably being drawn here by the Earths magnetic field. The missile warhead
will be equiped with...well...lets just call them magnets. These "magnets"
will have the exact opposite polarity than that Meteor is attracted to.
Basically, Meteor will push itself apart, once blown apart."

     "What's solution number 2?" said Cloud taking off the pot of soil.

     "Microbes"

     "Microbes?"

     "Yes. We can use microbes that's similiar to the type that's eating
the Titanic. We can launch a probe aimed at Meteor. These Microbes
will literally eat Meteor."

     "And what if these two solutions fail?" asked Cloud

     "...I don't know. I'll have to figure something out if they don't"

     "Well it's settled then. I vote we go for the missle attempt, even though it has
failed before," voted Cloud "what else have we got to lose?"

     "I agree with Cloud," said Tenchi.

     "Are there any objections?" asked Washu. There were none.

     "Well it's settled, we'll try the missile project," said Cloud.

     "What will we call this missile project?" asked Ryoko

     "Well...let's call it Project Alpha" said Washu.
     
     "Ok. That suits me fine," said Tenchi. "I'm going to my room."

Tenchi went up to his room and sat down on his bed. He put his elbows on his knees as he stared at
the floor. 'This isn't anything like we've ever faced before,' he thought. 'How are we going to
stop a Meteor, an insane dude, and a bunch of monsters called WEAPONS? Beats the heck out of me.'
Tenchi stood up and walked to his stereo. He was feeling a little depressed, so he put in a CD
that he commonly listened to when he was depressed. Tenchi lie down on his bed and closed his eyes
as he sank into the lyrics of Wait and Bleed.

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell I wait and bleed...

Goodbye!

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I CAN'T CONTROL MY SHAKES!
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong...
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...

GET OUTTA MY HEAD CUZ I DON'T NEED THIS!
Why I didn't I see this?
I'm a victim - Manchurian Candidate
I - HAVE - SINNED - BY - JUST
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, INSIDE MY SHELL I WAIT AND BLEED!

GOODBYE!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...
I've felt the hate rise up in me...
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...
I wander out where you can't see...
Inside my shell, I WAIT AND BLEED!

AND IT WAITS FOR YOU!

Tenchi wasn't awake long enough to hear all of the song, because he fell asleep...
