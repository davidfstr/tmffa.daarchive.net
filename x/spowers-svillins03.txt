CH 3 Kagato's Influence

Vegeta was flying through the sky near Tokyo when he heard a voice call him "Vegeta."

"Who is calling me and how do you know my name?" demanded Vegeta.

"Vegeta my name is Kagato I want to help you."

"Show yourself," said Vegeta now stopped still hovering in the air.

"Very well," said Kagato as he appeared before Vegeta.

"Now what do you want!"

"I simply want to help.  That is all.  I know that you are lost in this dimension and I know 
you want to get back.  All you have to do is destroy the one who brought you here it is 
that easy."

"I don't know you how do I know that you are telling me the truth?"

"You don't know that what I say is the truth but I am your only hope of getting back, so 
you must either trust me or stay here forever."

"Fine but if I find out you are lying you will pay.  Who is it I have to destroy."

"It is no one that you can not handle Vegeta after all I can sense your power you are the 
strongest in the universe.  The one you are after is Professor Washu and a boy called 
Tenchi.  Kill Washu and bring me Tenchi then I will be able to help you get home."

"Ill do it.  Where can I find Washu and Tenchi?"

"Simple really find your friend Gohan and you will find the ones you seek. You see back 
on the beach the boy your friend helped that was Tenchi.  Your friend does not now it but 
they are the ones who brought you here."

"When I kill them you better hold up your end of the bargain or you will pay," said 
Vegeta as he flew way.

"The fool I cant believe he fell for it so easy I wonder if he will go through with it?  No 
matter I sense evil in his heart so if it comes down to it I can use my mind control device 
on him just like I did on Debura."

***************************

"I wonder where Vegeta could be?  I have been looking for him for days now.  He is not 
powered up or I would be able to sense his energy.  Maybe I will power up some so he 
can find me if he wants," thought while flying over the beach where he meet Tenchi 
Gohan.

****************************

On planet Juri princess Ayeka followed by Sasami stormed into the throne room to see 
their dad.  "Dad why did you have the GP bring us back here?" demanded Ayeka.

"I did not want you to get hurt when they battled Ryoko." he replied.  "Besides it is time 
for you to marry so you can rule Juri."

"I will not marry anyone but Tenchi.  He loves me."

"Is that so?  I did not want to do this Ayeka but I see I have no choice."  He snapped his 
fingers and a screen appeared in front of him and Ayeka.  "This is a recording of Ryoko's 
trial at GP headquarters.  Watch it you will see who Tenchi loves."  Ayeka watched the 
screen.  She saw the trial then she saw Tenchi purpose to Ryoko.  A tear ran down 
Ayeka's face she fell on the floor crying.

"He chose her over me" she sobbed.

"There there said Ayeka's dad placing his hand on her shoulder you will get over him 
especially when you see the one I have picked out for you to marry."

************************

At the Masaki house Washu was working in here lab when she picked up a transmission 
from Juri.

"What do you want she asked the Juri operator cant you see I am busy."

"We have a call from the King of Juri and Princess Ayeka for Tenchi could you please 
get him."

"Why didn't you say so."  Washu then pushed a button on her ethereal computer to 
transfer the call to the TV in the living room.  She then got up and left the lab to find 
Tenchi.  "Tenchi I have a call for you.  Just come sit on the couch and I will play it 
through your TV."

"Ok, but who is it."

"You will see."  Washu then turned on the TV.  Ayeka was on the screen.

"Ayeka?"

"Yes lord Tenchi it is me," said Ayeka calmly although on the inside she was about to fall 
apart her years of princess training took over.  "I have called to say that I am not going to 
return to earth."

"But why?"

"Father has arranged for me to marry here and since you have proposed to Ryoko... (She 
hesitated)  I see whom you truly love

"How did you know?"

"Let me finish Tenchi.  As first princess of Juri it is my duty to marry and rule.  
Congratulations on you marriage Tenchi."  At this point Ayeka was showing visible sings 
of distress, and her father took over rather cheerfully he was happy that Ayeka now could 
not marry Tenchi (he did not want Ayeka to marry a partial earthling).

"Tenchi you are welcome any time on Juri also I have completed the full pardon for 
Ryoko have a happy time with her, and thank you for taking care of my daughters.  I 
must confess that I never was happy about Ayeka loving you but since you have now 
chosen Ryoko that is all behind us.  Goodbye" The TV screen then went black.

"Well Tenchi looks like Ayeka knows now," said Washu.  "Look on the bright side at 
least now you don't have to tell her yourself."

"Thanks Washu," said Tenchi

"No problem if you need me or just want to talk you know where to find me."  As Washu 
left for her lab Ryoko came down the stairs and noticed Tenchi looked sad.

"What is wrong Tenchi?" she asked  "aren't you happy we are engaged?"

"It's not that Ryoko I am very happy about that it is just.... well Ayeka just called she 
found out somehow and she is not coming back to earth.  She seamed very hurt and she is 
going to marry some guy her father picked for her."  Ryoko knew that Tenchi loved her 
but she saw sadness in his eyes.  Not sadness like he loved here as he did Ryoko but 
sadness from a love such as one would love a sister.

"Tenchi it will be ok just think of the happy times ahead of us now."

*************************** 

"I feel a tremendous energy.  It must be Gohan yes I am sure of it, it is Gohan's power.  
Now I will be able to find him easily," said Vegeta while flying towards where he sensed 
Gohan.

***************************
Gohan was just entering the front door of the house when he felt Vegeta's energy.  He 
turned to see Vegeta standing in the yard.  His arms were crossed and he was powered up 
although not in super Sayian form.  "Gohan I have discovered the one who has brought 
us here.  It is the one you call professor Washu.  The only way for us to get home is to 
destroy her and bring the boy Tenchi to a man named Kagato.  Then he will be able to 
help us get home.  Now Gohan let us get Washu."

"Are you sure about this Vegeta I mean they seam nice to me."

"Nice has nothing to do with it Gohan they are deceiving you now lets get Washu and 
bring him Tenchi I will do it with or with out your help," and with that he pushed Gohan 
aside and stepped into the house.

***************************** 

Everyone was assembled in Washu's lab.  "I am glad I got you all here before it was to 
late.  I sensed a giant power and thought there may be trouble."  Washu then brought up a 
screen showing Gohan's and Vegeta's conversation.

"Kagato it can't be!" said Kiyone

"It is defiantly his work.  He has turned Gohan's friend against us.  I am afraid we are no 
match for him in a direct fight our only hope is that Gohan can calm him down and talk 
some sense into him.  After all why would Vegeta believe a perfect stranger like 
Kagato?" said Washu.

"We better get ready anyway.  Ryoko do you think you could teleport me into my room 
to get sword Tenchi."

"Sure"

"Alright then lets go," said Tenchi.

"I think that it may be wise if you stay with me Washu," said Dr S.

"Hmm what do you mean?"

"I have just perfected my dematerializing power and now anyone who I touch can 
dematerialize with me.  So as long as we stay together if anything happens I can 
dematerialize you and nothing can then hurt you."

"You know Dr S that is not a bad idea." Said Washu.  "When we get done with all of this 
will you tell me how you dematerialized yourself?"

"Sure no problem"




******************************* 
Back in the house Ryoko and Tenchi appeared in Tenchi's room.  Tenchi ran over to his 
closet.  "I know I put it in here somewhere," said Tenchi throwing cloths out of his way.  
"Ahh here it is."

"You got it?  Good lets go we need to help Gohan"

******************************* 

"Where are they?" said Vegeta looking around the house.  As he turned towards the stairs 
Ryoko and Tenchi appeared.

"I don't know what Kagato told you but you must believe me we are not the ones he says 
we are," said Tenchi pulling out sword Tenchi.

"Enough boy we fight now," said Vegeta throwing an energy blast towards Tenchi.  
Tenchi dodged the blast.  It hit the wall behind him and in a large flash of light destroyed 
the entire house from the right past the stairs on.

"That is enough," yelled Tenchi charging Vegeta with sword Tenchi.

"Hmm silly boy," said Vegeta.  Tenchi struck out towards Vegeta but missed Vegeta 
easily moved out of his way.  He then countered with a quick jab to Tenchi's back.  
Tenchi crimpled on the floor like a rag doll.

"Tenchi," cried Ryoko summoning her energy sword. And charging Vegeta "You 
monster."

******************************* 

In the lab Washu was watching the action "I must help them.  Dr S you stay here and 
monitor Vegeta's power this info could be very useful.  Also when my machine is 
finished duplicating those Sensu bean brings them out I have a feeling we will need 
them," with that she left.

******************************* 

Vegeta noticed Washu walk out the door below the stairs.  "Finally you decided to show 
up," he said Vegeta turning to face Washu and at the same time swatting Ryoko away 
with one hand as she tried to attack him.

"Yes and now you lose," said Washu typing rapidly on her ethereal computer.  She 
quickly pulled up a mind control program and started it.  Vegeta raised his hand toward 
Washu to finish her off in one blast when suddenly he lost control.  He gripped his head 
and screamed.

"Get out of my head.  I wont listen again not like last time with that wizard Bobidy."
We now here Washu's voice in Vegeta's head.  "You don't want to do this Vegeta you 
want to help us.  You are a good person we need your help to destroy Kagato."

"No I wont I cant," Vegeta dropped on the floor Gohan watched with some concern.  He 
did not want Vegeta to kill his new friends yet he did not want to see Vegeta hurt.  
Suddenly Vegeta stood up.

"I understand now yes I will help," said Vegeta

"Good," said Washu smiling "I'm such a genius she thought."  Then suddenly Vegeta 
started up again.  He charged up to super Sayian power.  It was all Washu could do to 
stand up against so much energy.  Vegeta seamed to be fighting a battle within himself.  
He then pointed his hand at Washu again.

"You may have invaded my mind and my body but there is one thing a Sayian always 
keeps his power." Exclaimed Vegeta as he shot a large energy blast at Washu.  Her shield 
absorbed much of the power but then failed and she was thrown into a wall.  Vegeta then 
aimed ant Washu again "Good by" he said.  It was then Gohan decided he had better do 
something.  Just as Vegeta was about to fire and energy blast Gohan charged up to Super 
Sayian and used instant transmission to get to Vegeta.  He grabbed Vegeta's arm.

"Vegeta you must stop this" he exclaimed.

"Let go of me Gohan"

"I will not these people are our friends Vegeta"

"Friends.  They are not they are the enemy and if you side with them I will have to 
dispose of you too."  Dr. S took advantage of this pause and walked to Washu he then 
grabbed her and dematerialized bringing her back to the lab.

"Fine but if we fight lets take it out side."

"Have it your way Gohan," said Vegeta and with that they headed out.  Ryoko was just 
coming to.  

"My head" she thought.  Then she remembered what had just happened "Tenchi!"  She 
ran over to him and picked him up he was still alive.  She then carried him into Washu's 
lab and placed him on a table.  Dr S was their just taking the newly created Sensu beans 
out of Washu's machine.  He gave one to Washu, then Tenchi and finally Ryoko.  They 
helped right away.  Tenchi got up and looked around Ryoko was sitting right next to him 
tears in her eyes.  "I thought I lost you Tenchi."  Washu was also feeling a lot better.

"I don't see how it is possible that a being under mind control can still control his own 
power.  This is very interesting," said Washu.

************************* 
Meanwhile outside Vegeta and Gohan were facing off.

"I the prince of all Sayians will put you in your place Gohan."

"Vegeta I don't want to fight you"

"You are weak just like your father but don't worry I wont kill you I will just teach you a 
few lesions," said Vegeta while throwing an energy blast towards Gohan.  Gohan dodged 
and charged Vegeta.  Vegeta blocked Gohan's attack, and countered with his own.  
Gohan matched every move Vegeta could make.

**************************

"This could take a while," said Washu watching the action on a screen but I am gathering 
tons of useful information on high-powered fighting.

************************** 

"This Vegeta is stronger than I thought I must learn the source of his power," said 
Kagato.

************************** 

Back outside the action was really heating up.  Gohan and Vegeta were both in Super 
Sayian form.  Every hit they exchanged released a tremendous amount of energy shaking 
the ground.  The fight went on for hours.

************************** 

"Washu do something," said Tenchi we need to help Gohan.

"He is fine Tenchi so far neither one of them has landed a successful attack on the other 
There power is amazing they are both at least 10,000 times as powerful as the king of 
Juri."

"But Washu we need to help them the sooner this is over the sooner we can get Gohan to 
help us stop Kagato," said Ryoko shivering at even the thought of Kagato.

"Well all right as soon as I get enough data I will seal Vegeta in a stasis block.  Then I 
will see if I can erase his memory of meeting Kagato and of this whole incident."

"Thank you Washu," said Tenchi.
 
***************************** 
It was now the next day and Vegeta and Gohan were still going at it.  When suddenly a 
great yellow light surrounded Vegeta.  "What is this?"

"I don't know Vegeta," answered Gohan a little worried for Vegeta.

"I can't move."  Then the light left and Vegeta was sealed inside what looked like a 
yellow glass block.

***************************** 

"There now you see I have immobilized him."

"Are you sure that will hold him Washu?" asked Tenchi

"Of course I am sure I am after all the greatest scientific genius in the universe.  Not even 
Vegeta can break out of that stasis block."  

"Now lets go let Gohan no what is going on he looks a little worried," said Tenchi.

"Why should he care after all Vegeta was trying to kill him," said Ryoko

"He cares because he has a kind heart Ryoko he does not want to see anyone hurt.  He is 
in a way like the Tenchi from a different dimension," said Washu.

"Fine I will tell him," said Ryoko disappearing.

******************************

Outside Gohan had powered down and was looking at Vegeta sealed in what looked like 
a block of yellow glass when suddenly Ryoko appeared next to him.  "Is he alive?" asked 
Gohan.

"Yes he is alive.  Washu simply sealed him in a stasis block."

"A stasis block what is that?"

"I cant explain it if you want to know ask Washu.  Now give me your hand," Ryoko took 
Gohan's hand and then with her other hand touched the stasis block in an instant all three 
of them disappeared.

****************************** 

Back in the lab Washu was already getting her mind-altering equipment ready when 
Ryoko appeared along with Gohan and Vegeta.  "What are you going to do with him?" 
asked Gohan.

"Nothing really I am simply going to remove his memory of Kagato and this whole 
incident that way once we beat Kagato and return you two home he will not remember a 
thing.  Until then he stays in the stasis block we cant afford to have another out burst 
from him."

"I understand," said Gohan.

****************************** 

Tenchi was standing in the ruins of his house.  "My house.  Look at my house."

"Don't worry Tenchi said Ryoko putting a hand on his shoulder."  Normally she would 
have hugged him but for some reason it just did not seam appropriate at this moment.  "I 
am sure we can rebuild it with the help of Washu."

"Ya I guess you are right Ryoko, at least we are all safe," said Tenchi turning to look at 
Ryoko.  It had been a while since he last stopped to look at how beautiful she really was.  
Then he remembered he had still not gotten her an engagement ring.

**************************** 

"Darn you Washu.  Every time I am so close you get in my way," said Kagato slamming 
his fist on a table next to him.

"Don't worry master I will finish Washu off for you," said Debura.

"Yes I suppose you are right Debura if I can figure out a way to lure Washu here she will 
not be able to make a stasis block will be powerless to stop you.  The only problem is 
what to do about the pure hearted Gohan"

******************************* 

"So who is this Kagato you are all talking about anyway," asked Gohan.

"He was my student," said Washu turning to look at Gohan.  "He was very bright and he 
was obsessed with science, but he went to far.  He became so obsessed with science that 
he imprisoned me in a ship that I created called the Soja for 700 years until Mihoshi freed 
me.  He took my daughter Ryoko and through mind control forced her to kill thousands 
of people.  His goal was to unlock the secrets of the Juri power and to rule the universe.  
Then about 1.5 years ago Kagato came to earth in search for Ryoko he found her and 
tried to bring her under his control again, but Tenchi stopped him.  A great power awoke 
within Tenchi and he faced 	Kagato in a battle for Ryoko.  That is when Mihoshi freed 
me.  Tenchi killed Kagato or so we thought but now he is back."

"He imprisoned you for 700 years how old are you people," asked Gohan then he 
remembered you should not ask a lady her age and put his hand over his mouth.  "Opps I 
forgot it is not polite to ask lady her age."

"That's alright Gohan I am 20,000 years old Kagato is 5,000 and Ryoko is 2,000."

"20,000 years old!  How can people be so old here."

"Well we are not from earth Gohan our life span is very different from earthlings.  But 
enough about that we must find a way to defeat Kagato and end this nightmare once and 
for all."  Gohan turned to leave the lab.  "And Gohan."

"yes?"

"Don't worry about your friend Vegeta here he will be fine."

*************************** 

Tenchi decided he had better go to town and get a ring for Ryoko.  Then he turned his 
attention back to the ruble that used to be his house.  He was still staring at the ruble pile 
when Gohan exited Washu's lab.  "Gohan thanks for helping out back there.  I know it 
must have been tough fighting your friend like that but if it had not been for you we 
would all be dead now."

"No problem," said Gohan running his hand through his hair "Vegeta and I have had a 
long history of fighting."

*************************** 

Back in Washu's lab.  "Dr. S do you think you could help me with Vegeta?"

"Sure."

"Ok then you push the button on the bottom of that consol and I will get the memory 
manipulator device ready.  Once we finish this I will see what I can do about Tenchi's 
house.  We need to fix it before Noboyuki comes back and sees it like this."

*****************************

Some time later. Noboyuki walks into the house.  Tenchi and Ryoko are sitting on the 
couch everything seams normal except when Noboyuki walks into the Kitchen he sees 
everything is upside down.  "You said you could read the plans Mihoshi."

"I'm sorry Washu looks like I read them upside down."

"Ahhh my Kitchen what did you do," exclaimed Noboyuki

"Well your house was destroyed so I rebuilt it.  It would have been perfect but someone 
messed up," said Washu turning to look at Mihoshi.  Mihoshi now had tears flooding her 
eyes.  Noboyuki only heard the words house destroyed.

"Destroyed what do you mean!"

"Why don't you ask Tenchi?  I have work to do," said Washu walking towards her lab.

"I hear the house got destroyed today Tenchi," said Noboyuki.

"Well things got a bit out of hand when Kagato tried using Gohan's friend Vegeta to 
destroy us all," said Tenchi almost as if it were a normal thing.  He had long since started 
expecting this sort of thing.

"I think I need a drink," said Noboyuki walking out of the room. 

*******************************

Early the next Saturday Tenchi was up and getting ready to go to town.  He had decided 
he would go to town and buy Ryoko a ring before anyone else woke up.  "Even if they do 
wake up I will tell them I need to get something back that I let my friend barrow," he 
thought although he knew it was a rather bad excuse.  Tenchi moved silently down the 
stairs noticing Ryoko was sleeping on her favorite rafter.  He just got to the door when he 
heard 

"Tenchi."  He turned around to see who was calling him.

"Good," he thought it is only Ryoko talking in her sleep.  "That was close."  He then 
reached for the door handle.

"Tenchi."  This time he knew it was not Ryoko.  He turned to see Washu standing behind 
him.

"Yes Washu."

"What are you doing up so early?"

"Well I umm let my friend barrow something and I have to go get it from him now," 
she will never buy it he thought.  Washu looked at Tenchi. 

 
"You know Tenchi you are not very good at lying.  Come on you can tell me what are 
you doing?"

"Ok don't tell anyone."

"I wont"

"I am going to town to buy a ring for Ryoko."

"Finally I thought you had forgotten you were engaged to her."  Then Washu stopped 
talking and looked like she was thinking about something.  "I will go with you after all 
you need a lady to help you pick out a good ring."

"Ok thanks Washu"

"Don't mention it and as long as we are going let's try out my new teleporting device."

"I knew there would be a catch," thought Tenchi following Washu into her lad.

*************************** 

Tenchi and Washu are standing outside a jewelry store.

"It worked.  I am such a Genius."

"You are the greatest," said puppet 1

"You are the smartest in the universe," said puppet 2

"Now lets find a ring for Ryoko," said Washu walking into the store, Tenchi followed.  A 
man working at the store walked over to Tenchi may I help you?

"Where are your engagement rings?"  Then man looked at Tenchi then looked at Washu.  
You could tell he was thinking she looks too young.  Washu noticed the man.

"Were not getting married," said Washu  "I am here to make sure he gets a good ring" 
The mans face changed instantly.

"Right this way sir."  He showed them a glass case at the far end of the store.  "How 
much money do you want to spend?" asked the man.

"I was thinking about 70,000 yen ($525)"

"For that you can get any of these said the man motioning to a section of the case."

"Such a hard choice"

"Hmm," said Washu staring at the rings.  In her mind she was quickly calculating 
Ryoko's profile to determine the ring she would like most.

"What do you think Washu?"

"I think you should get this one," said Washu pointing to a platinum ring with a heart 
shaped canary yellow diamond.  "She would love it."

"How much is that one?" asked Tenchi.

"150,000 yen ($1100)," said the man "but wait yes today it is on sale for only 90,000 yen 
($700) it is 40% off."

"20,000 more than I have," said Tenchi

"You could finance the rest for 1 year"

"How much would the payments be?"

"About 1,650 yen ($12.30) a month"

"Actually it is 1666.6666667 yen ($12.41) a month" said Washu.  The man got out a 
calculator and quickly typed it in.

"Your right"

"Aren't I the greatest" though Washu.

"Ill take it," said Tenchi.  Back outside the store Washu is typing some command on a 
wrist computer.  Tenchi has the ring in a small box in his pocket.  "You really think she 
will like it Washu?"

"I know she will Tenchi.  Now lets get home," said Washu pushing a red button on her 
wrist computer.  Tenchi and Washu disappear.

************************ 

Back at the Masaki house Ryoko is up looking for Tenchi.  "Tenchi where are you?" she 
called phasing into his room.  "Hmm he is not here.  Where could he be," said Ryoko 
walking into the dining room.

************************ 

In Washu's lab Tenchi and Washu appear. "It works.  My machine works."

"Yes Washu it worked great.  Just one thing be sure not to let Ryoko know where we 
went I want to surprise her."

"Surprise who?"  Tenchi and Washu whipped around to see who the voice was.

"Oh it's only you Dr. S," sighed Tenchi with relief.  "I guess I will tell you we were 
getting a ring for Ryoko, but don't tell her OK."

"I wont."  With that Tenchi walked out of the lab to see Ryoko sitting at the table.  She 
looked over at him.

"So that is where you were.  I was looking all over for you," said Ryoko teleporting over 
to Tenchi hugging him.  "What were you doing in there anyway?"

"I was helping Washu with her new Teleportation machine," said Tenchi truthfully, he 
did not add he was in town buying a ring.

*********************** 

Hours latter at Tenchi and Ryoko are out walking around the lake the moon is full and it 
is not very dark out.  Washu is on the roof of the house watching them with her new 
super vision-enhancing machine.

"Ryoko..."

"Yes Tenchi," she turned to face him.  He looked into her yellow eyes.

"Ryoko remember when I asked you to marry me?"

"How could I ever forget?  That was the happiest day of my life."

"Well I have something for you so you can remember that day forever." He reached into 
his pocket and got out the box.  "Take it."  Ryoko took the box and opened it.

"Tenchi it is beautiful," she said hugging him.  "Now we really are engaged."

"Here let me put it on you," Tenchi took the ring and lipped it on her Ring finger.  Her 
hands were silky smooth.

"Tenchi..." Ryoko wanted to ask if she could stay in his room tonight but she did not 
want to ruin the moment.

"Yes?"  Ryoko hesitated then she heard a voice it was Washu using their telepathic link.  

"Ask him Ryoko after all you are engaged now it is only natural."  Normally Ryoko 
would have been mad that Washu was invading her privacy but this time she did not care.

"Thanks mom," she answered

"Tenchi can I stay in your room tonight?"

"Umm...  Ok why not after all we are engaged."

"At a boy Tenchi I knew you could do it," said Washu still watching them from the roof 
of the house only now she was also recording them to show the whole Masaki house how 
Tenchi really purposed to Ryoko.

Tenchi walked in the front door of the house Ryoko was with him they were holding 
hands.  Noboyuki noticed Ryoko was wearing a ring he instantly recognized it as an 
engagement ring.

"Way to go Tenchi!  I am so proud of you my son getting married," said Noboyuki 
slapping Tenchi on the back.  "Tonight you two can use the master bedroom."

"Dad," said Tenchi turning bright red.

"Congratulations Tenchi and Ryoko," said Yosho in his normal calm voice.  "Ryoko his 
voice changed slightly I would like to welcome you as the newest member of our family.  
Let us put out differences behind us.  All is forgiven."  Ryoko never quite trusted or liked 
Yosho since he locked her in that cave but hearing him say this made her happy.

"Yes Yosho let us put our differences behind us.  Leave the past in the past.  I am 
suddenly getting tired lets go to bead Tenchi" with that she pulled Tenchi up the stairs 
toward the bedroom.

"Love is so beautiful," said Noboyuki.  "Now where did I put my camera?"

Yosho thinking to himself "It sure is nice to know that now I have a family that will be 
around for a while.  Tenchi with his Jurian blood will live at least 10,000 years, Ryoko 
who is already 2,000 years old, Washu at 20,000 years. Every one except Noboyuki will 
live a long time.  I get so lonely out living all my friends and family her on earth that only 
live 80 or 90 years, but now that will all change.  Maybe now I should revile that I am not 
as old as I look.  Would they understand why I have hid this from them?  Washu would 
but would the rest?"
