The World Martial Arts Tournament Returns!-Chapter 1-"The Competetors."
Tenchi,Ryoko,Ayeka and Yosho enter the World Martial Arts Tournament for
some easy money,but find more than what they bargained for.A Tenchi
Muyo,Dragon Ball and Bloody Roar 2 X-over.

Osaka,Japan.

Sasami:Ryoko,can you go get Tenchi for breakfast?
Ryoko:Sure thing Sasami.
Ryoko phased into a tree,where Tenchi conveniently happened to be working
near.Ryoko watched him plowing the fields.She also noticed that he was
sweating an awful lot,even though it was freezing outside.After a few
moments,he couldn't go on any further.He set the hoe down and sat under the
tree to rest.He breathed heavily,so Ryoko thought he could use some
"freshening up" before breakfast.She floated silently and slowly behind
Tenchi.She stopped when he stretched his arms.When he set his arms
down,Ryoko gently set her hands on his shoulders.
Tenchi:Ah!
Ryoko:You poor thing.You're so strung up you're likely to have a heart
attack.
Tenchi:No,it's not that.
Ryoko:What is it then?
Tenchi:You're hands are freezing.
Ryoko:Oh.So,you're cold?
Tenchi:Well,sort of,yeah.
Ryoko:I can take care of that.
With that,Ryoko took her hands off of Tenchi's shoulders and wrapped her
hands around his waist.Tenchi was getting pretty nervous;with Ryoko,you
never knew what she was going to do next.Ryoko pulled Tenchi closer,so it
looked like she was hugging him from behind while sitting down.After a few
moments of not knowing what to do or say,Tenchi was about to ask her to let
go,when he felt warmer.In fact,it was kind of cozy.He snuggled up to
Ryoko.She smiled.
Ryoko:Better?
Tenchi:Much.Thanks Ryoko.
Ryoko:You're welcome.But,you will have to pay.
Tenchi:You mean I have to pay you money to keep myself warm?
Ryoko:Well,not in money.
Tenchi was about to ask what she meant,but he had been listening,and knew
what she meant.
Tenchi:Ryoko!
Ryoko:No,not that!Just a kiss.
Tenchi:Oh.Well,as long as you won't tell...
Ryoko:I won't.Will you?
Tenchi didn't answer,he just leanded into Ryoko.Ryoko felt soft lips meet
hers,and Tenchi felt the same.Ryoko laid her head back onto the tree and
kissed him back aggresively.Tenchi knew this day would come,when Ryoko gets
him into kissing her.But he didn't think he would enjoy it!They were kissing
for quite a while,because neither one wanted it to end.
Suddenly,Ryoko remembered everyone was waiting for them for breakfast.And
when Ayeka figured out what was happening,she would be in BIG
trouble.Relunctantly,she pulled away from Tenchi's embrace.
Tenchi:What is it?
Ryoko:Well,Sasami sent me hear to get you for breakfast.
Tenchi:How long ago was that?
Ryoko:About two or three minutes ago.
Tenchi:Oh,man!We better get going before Ayeka gets here!
Ryoko:My thoughts exactly.
Ryoko teleported both of them to the breakfast table.Everyone except for
Washu (Who would have seen that one coming?)
were already eating.Ayeka instantly shot questions at Tenchi.
Ayeka:Lord Tenchi!What happened?What did she do to you?
Tenchi:Relax,Ayeka.Ryoko just took a little while to find me.
Ayeka:Are you sure you're all right?
Tenchi:I'm fine,Ayeka.Trust me.
Ayeka:All right,Lord Tenchi.I trust you.
Ryoko:Hey,where's Noboyuki?
Noboyuki wasn't at his usual place at the table.
Yosho:That's odd.I thought I saw him down here helping Sasami set the table.
Nobuyuki:I'm right here!
Tenchi:Dad!There you are!Where were you?
Noboyuki:I was just recording a wild life video for a friend of mine.He
wants to help his son study for a test tomorrow.
Sasami:Wow!What animals were you filming?
Noboyuki:Hmm...I'm not entirely sure what they were.
Tenchi:Well,after breakfast,if you let me look at it,I could probably tell
you what they were.
Noboyuki:Why thank you Tenchi!I want to make sure I didn't record the wrong
animals.

***********************************************
After breakfast.
***********************************************
Sasami and Ryo-oki were playing outside,Kiyone and Mihoshi were reading at
the dinner table,Ayeka and Ryoko were on the couch,waiting for Tenchi,and
Tenchi was just now coming down the stairs with the videotape Noboyuki
recoreded earlier.Tenchi popped it into the V.C.R. and went to sit inbetween
Ayeka and Ryoko.
Ayeka:This will be my first time seeing Earth animals in their natural
environment
Tenchi:Well,I hope you enjoy it!
Tenchi hit the play button on the remote control.And dropped the remote when
he saw what Noboyuki was recording.
It was from earlier that moring,when Ryoko went to go get Tenchi.
Ayeka:That's you,Lord Tenchi.He must have spotted you while recording the
animals.

************************************************
One minute later...
************************************************
Ayeka:This must be some sort of joke,made by Washu.
Washu:I didn't have anything to do with this.
Ayeka:Well,there must be some sort good explanation for all of this.
Ryoko:Why can't you just face the facts,Ayeka?That was a real recording;it
all happened.
Ayeka:Because I know that Lord Tenchi would never kiss filth like you when
he could be kissing me.
Ryoko:Oh,yeah?Watch this!
Ryoko kissed Tenchi passionatly.At first Tenchi was worried about what Ayeka
would say about that,but found he didn't want to break the kiss.His tongue
searched her mouth,upside-down,inside-out,etc.She did the
same.Unfortunatly,this little "Make-Out Central" only lasted about four
seconds,because Ayeka pulled Ryoko away from Tenchi and threw her into the
wall.Ryoko got down on her knees and spat up blood.Ayeka kicked her in the
side,then shocked her like she's never shocked before.Jurain power tore
through Ryoko's body with no remorse.Ryoko screamed in pain,for about two
minutes.When Ayeka finally stopped,Ryoko lie on the ground,her clothes black
and charred,her hair black as the night,and smoke coming off of her
body.Ayeka was enjoying the sight of Ryoko's lifeless body lying on the
floor.Ayeka turned around.
Ayeka:Don't worry,Lord Tenchi.She won't pester either of us any further.Huh?
Tenchi was gone.But he was there just a second ago,so where did he go?
Ryoko:Spoke too soon.
Ayeka turned around only to see Ryoko,with Tenchi behind her,with her hands
up.She let loose a volley of energy blasts,flying by so fast
that...well,they were pretty fast.After about three minutes of this
attack,(Three minutes=356 blasts)
Ryoko stopped,panting like a dog.If you were in a plane and you happened to
see the Masaki...no...what was LEFT of the Masaki home,you would only see
about half of the house.Poor Washu,Kiyone and Mihoshi.They were being
protected by a shield generated by Washu,but the noise...OH BOY!The noise of
Ryoko's assault was strong enough to get through the shield.But even worse
was Ayeka.Her hair was torn,her clothes thrashed,cuts on her arms,and dust
all over her body.Her
Jurian shield had barely held together.Another attack like that,Ayeka
thought,and I'll be killed on the spot!But Ryoko was
much too tired to try another attack like that.It would take her a few hours
of resting to get even half of her strenght left.
At the same time,with a smirk,Ayeka and Ryoko fell to the ground,face
first.Tenchi only stared in awe at what had just happened in his house.

*********************************************
Two hours later...
*********************************************
Ryoko:Ow!Watch it!
Tenchi:That's not a very good way to talk to a paying customer.
Ryoko:Hey,Tenchi.
Tenchi:Hey.
Ryoko:Where's Ayeka?
Tenchi:She's over there,unconcious.
Ryoko:Are you okay?
Tenchi:I'm fine.
Ryoko:So,how bad is the house?
Tenchi:What house?Oh,you mean the pile of wood over there?
Ryoko:That bad,huh?
Ayeka:Yes,all because of you.
Ryoko:Hey Ayeka,I have an idea of how you can make it up to Tenchi for
destroying his home!
Ayeka:Even though I didn't,what is it?
Ryoko:For starters,you can apologize,then you can take that pile of wood
over there and stick it up your big,fat,a**.
Ayeka:That was extremly rude!
Tenchi:Now girls,haven't you learned your lesson already?
Ayeka:I suppose you're right.
Ryoko:Tenchi?
Tenchi:Yeah?
Ryoko:I promise I'll make it up to you.
Ayeka:I shall also.
Tenchi:Thank you girls.Hey Little Washu,can you fix the damage with your
computers?
Washu:During the fight,my lab was destroyed.So that would be a no.
Ryoko:We need money.Fast.
Washu:Well,speak of the devil.
Tenchi:What is it,Little Washu?
Washu:Well,we need money,right?
Tenchi:Oh,yeah.
Washu:Well,look at this.
Washu scooted over a bit so Tenchi could see.Ryoko and Ayeka also were
curious as to what Washu had up her sleeve.Amazingly,the T.V. still had a
little life to it.The screen flickerd with hardly any life left.On it,a man
wearing a black
shirt and a pair of black shades with a microphone was doing a commercial.
Announcer:Do have fighting skills,but don't know what to do with
them?Well,in one week from now,we will be holding the World Martial Arts
Tournament again!What's that you say?What do you get out of it?Well,should
you win the championship,you will be rewarded with $50,000,000 Yen!And
no,you're not going deaf!So come on down and give it a shot!
Everyone:Ohhh...

**********************************************
One week later.
**********************************************

Tenchi:Where is the regristration line?
Ryoko:I think it's over there.
Tenchi:You're right!Well,let's go sign up!
Everyone but Tenchi,Ayeka and Ryoko:Bye!Good luck!
With a wave,Tenchi,Ryoko and Ayeka waved farewell to the others,and they
would need all the luck they would need.Once regristrated,they decided to
check out the competion.And so far,this looked like easy money.While
looking,
Tenchi accidentely bumped into a girl about Tenchi's age.She wore a blue
vest,blue shorts which only reached to her thighs,and white sleeves coming
out of the vest.The rim of the sleeves were blue,and on the back of her vest
was a pink circle with a pink paw in the middle.The sleeves were a little
long for her arms,though.She wore her hair in a ponytail in the back,and two
sections of her hair separated in front of her face.She had yellow cat-like
eyes and brown boots.(Not like they're related!)
Tenchi(Blushing):Oops!Sorry!
Uriko:That's okay.I should have been watching where I was going.Are you
entering the tournament?
Tenchi:Yeah.My name's Tenchi.Are you entering too?
Uriko:Yep!I'm Uriko.Nice to meet you.
Ayeka:Stay away from Lord Tenchi!
Uriko:Who's she?
Tenchi:This is Ayeka.Ayeka,this is Uriko.
Uriko:Hi!
Ayeka:Yes,nice to meet you too.Now please leave!
Urkio:You're mean!
Ayeka:And you're trying to get Tenchi.
Uriko:You like him,don't you?
Ayeka:Yes!So does he,and no one else!
Uriko:I'm going to teach you a lesson in the competion!
Ayeka:Sounds interesting.Just don't lose before you get the chance to be
beaten by me!
Uriko:Same to you.
Ayeka:Now leave!
Uriko:Fine,I will!Bye Tenchi.
Tenchi:Bye,Uriko.
Uriko,fuming in irratation,walked away.
Tenchi:Ayeka,why did you do that?
Ayeka:I could see she was attracted to you.Ryoko is hard enough competion as
it is.I wouldn't have it.
Tenchi:Speaking of which,where is Ryoko?
Ayeka:Who cares?
Tenchi:There she is!
Ryoko was still checking for any danger of losing the competion.Suddenly,she
felt something strong,something she hadn't sensed since Kagato.Alarmed,she
looked for the culprit.But found that she couldn't find it again.She decided
she would find it in the tournament.She turned only to have Tenchi and
Ayeka...okay,so Tenchi greet her.
Tenchi:What is it?
Ryoko:I thought I felt something...
Tenchi:Like what?
Ryoko:Like someone strong enough to beat us.
Silence.
Ayeka:Impossible!No one can beat Lord Tenchi!
Ryoko:I don't know...
Ayeka:I have faith in Lord Tenchi!
Ryoko:Whatever.
Speaker:Attention!(Loud feedback.)OW!Will all competetors please report to
the waiting area.Repeat,...
Tenchi:Well,that's our cue!
Ayeka:Let's go!
Ryoko:Let's just get this over with.

******************************************
15 minutes later...
******************************************
Announcer:Kasabi loses!Tenchi advances!
Ryoko and Ayeka:Yey,Tenchi!
Tenchi:Yes!
Announcer:Well,wonders cease!Now,for our next fight,we have two very special
fighters.We have Uriko,a young and agile fighter,and Giran,a huge fighter
from all the way from China!This should prove interesting!Here they come
now!
Suddenly,what looked like a much smaller version of Godzilla with wings
stepped into the ring.He was slighly taller than a grown man.He smiled,his
teeth filled with white shiny teeth.
Proudly,Uriko stepped out.Smiling and waving,she ran into the ring with full
confidence of winning.
Tenchi:She looks as if she's...
Ryoko:Excited.
Ayeka:She can't win this one.Pity,I wanted to embarrass her.
Tenchi:Do your best,Uriko!
Blushing,she waved at him.However...
Announcer:Begin!
Uriko had dropped her guard,and Giran saw an opening.He lunged forward and
punched her in the stomach.She flew upward,toward the crowd.Giran and Ayeka
smiled as Uriko shot towards her defeat.(You lose if you give up,touch
outside the ring,stay on the ground for over 10 seconds,or use constant
violence.)Just before she left the ring boundaries,Uriko did a frontflip and
landed on the edge of the ring.She leaped at Giran and kicked at his head.He
easily blocked it.Then,she kicked him in the knee.Losing concentration,he
howled in pain.Uriko unleashed a furious punch combo,kicked him into the
air,did the punch combo again before he landed,did a frontflip and kicked
him to the ground.Giran landed on his feet.Which was bad,because Uriko
wasn't finished.Once she landed,she stood on one leg and pounded into his
face,head and shoulders quickly and powerfully.Just when you thought it was
over,she used the leg she wasn't standing on and kicked him towards
Ayeka.Just before he hit Ayeka,!
he used his wings and stopped himself in midair.The crowd went nuts.
Announcer:Well,what a great start!Uriko gave Giran a pounding,but he won't
give up so soon!
Giran flew back into the ring.Uriko was panting and was tired after her
attack.Without warning,Giran opened his mouth and shot out what looked like
pink Bubble Tape.It wrapped around Uriko's body.She fell to the ground with
a PLOP.
Announcer:Uh-oh!Looks like Uriko will have some trouble winning this bout!
Uriko realized her arms were free.She punched and tore and prodded and bit
at the stuff,but all of it just hurt her.
Giran:Try all you want,no one can break out of my Merry-Go-Round-Gum!
Uriko suddenly began laughing.
Announcer:I don't know why,but Uriko doesn't seem too intimidated by Giran's
gum!
Giran:Why are laughing?
Uriko:Because you're about to lose.
Giran:Well,if you can break out of that stuff,you might have the slightest
chance.But that won't happen too soon!
Uriko:Just watch me.
Uriko jumped up and landed on her feet.Then,she screamed.
All of a sudden,a light came from her body.The light was too bright to look
at.When the light faded,everyone looked at Uriko and gasped.
In Uriko's place was a cat-like creature,with cat hair growing from her
arms,legs,face,etc.She had pointed ears and whiskers.She also had claws on
the end of her fingers and a tail growing from...well,let's just say they
look funny anywhere else.Other than that,she looked excatly the same.She
smiled.
Tenchi:Uriko...
Ryoko:This will be harder than I thought.
Ayeka:She cheated!That can't possibly be her!
Giran:What the...
Announcer:I don't know what happened,but it looks like Uriko has transformed
into a cat!
Uriko began to claw and bite at the gum binding her.After a few moments,she
broke out witha cry.The gum fell to the ground,and Giran was
speachless.Well,not exactly.
Giran:HEY!Isn't that cheating?!Using her claws like that?
Tenchi:Yeah right!What do you call that crap you wrapped her up with?And
what about your wings?
Giran:That wasn't a tool,that came from my own organs!And my wings are are
entirely natural too!So there!
Ayeka:That's right!Giran wasn't cheating!
Tenchi:So,natural things aren't against the rules to you Giran,is that it?
Giran:That's right.
Tenchi:Well,Uriko's claws are just as natural as your gum and wings.
Announcer:I'm afraid he's right.That's not considered cheating in the book
of rules.
Uriko howled like a cat and lunged at him.Giran swung at her.She jumped up
and scratched his face.He screamed in pain.Uriko kicked him in the
stomach,then uppercutted him...right out of the ring!
Announcer:That's definetly in the book,and that means you're out!Uriko
progresses!
Uriko changed back to her normal self and celebrated.Unfortunatly,she
tripped and fell flat on her face.
Crowd:Ooo...
Uriko:Ow!

***********************************
Three minutes later...
***********************************
Announcer:Well,THAT was quite an interesting fight!Whatever is left of poor
Jenny has lost!Next,we have young Krillin at the age of thirteen,and
Kenji,another young man at the age of...well I don't know!Here's Krillin!And
right behind him,Kenji!
A young boy stepped out,smiling and waving.He had a red outfit with a symbol
on his left shoulder.He was also bald.The other one,Kenji,had his eyes shut
and two of his fingers pointed upward,as if meditating.He had black hair,a
blue outfit,black shoes,a grey belt,and a red scarf tyed around his neck and
was hanging at his back.They entered the ring.
Announcer:Begin!
Krillin jumped back and took his fighting stance,not knowing what to
expect.But Kenji stood in the same position.A few moments later,Krillin
began to wonder what he was doing.
Announcer:Uh,maybe you didn't hear me,Kenji,but the match has started.Hello?
Guy in crowd:Hey,you're stinking up the stadium!Get outta' here!
He threw a pop can at Kenji.A the last moment,the can
dissapeared.Slowly,Kenji opened his eyes.And,just as slowly,he raised his
other hand to reveal...
the pop can.
He crumpled it up and threw it into a recycling bin.Then,he attacked.
Kenji:HAH!
He ran with amazing speed and kicked at Krillin.He dodged it and punched at
him.He blocked him and punched at him.They swung at each other for a little
while,and then Krillin did a frontflip and kicked at Kenji in the
back.CRACK!Then,Krillin turned around and was about to grab him when he felt
something wasn't right.
Krillin:Wait,I didn't hit him hard enough for a "crack" sound...
Krillin looked at Kenji and gasped in confusion at what he saw.
It was a cracked log.
Suddenly,Krillin felt Kenji grab him from behind.He jumped into the
air.And,in mid-air,Kenji made Krillin do half of a backflip,so his head was
pointing at the ground.Kenji used Krillin's armpits and the bottom of his
feet as a ground for his legs and arms.As they propelled towards the
ground,Krillin only screamed in terror.
WHAM!!Krillin landed,head-first,into the ground.Kenji did a frontflip right
when he hit and landed on his feet.He shut his eyes and waited...either for
Krillin to get back up or for the announcer to start counting.
Announcer:Oh,yeah!One...two...three...four...five...six...this could be it
folks!He's not moving!
Goku:Come on Krillin!Stand up!
Slowly,Krillin regained himself.
Announcer:Seven...eight...nine...ten!
Krillin was standing.
Announcer:Oh my!Even after a hard hit by Kenji,Krillin is still alright!
Krillin:Ow...
Kenji:Impressive.
Krillin:So,you do talk.How did you do that log trick?
Kenji:Don't waste your breath.Save it for when you need it.
Kenji ran at Krillin and again,they went swinging and ducking and kicking
and blocking.But Krillin gained an advantage
and started to push Kenji towards the end of the ring.Right when he got him
to the edge,he found it hard to push him any further.Kenji smiled.
Ayeka:Looks like Krillin might win this one.
Ryoko:He's just toying with him.
Tenchi:Who?Kenji?Is he that confident?
Ryoko:It doesn't seem that way,but that is the only logical
explanation.OH-NO!I'm talking like Washu!
Uriko:Kenji will win.
Ayeka:How could you possibly know?
Uriko:Because I know what he's capable of.
Ayeka:Is that it?I think you're just jealous,because you aren't as strong as
they are.
Uriko:Plus he's like me.
Ryoko:What?You mean he can transform into a cat like you?
Uriko:Actually,a half-beast.And he can't do that,no.
Tenchi:What do you mean?
Uriko:Just watch.
As if on cue,Kenji threw one of Krillin's punches away and did a
frontflip,twisting in the air and landed behind him.
Krillin:Not again!
Krillin did a backflip.But before he had the chance to land,Kenji jumped in
the air and grabbed him.
Bakaryu:Not so fast!
He did several backflips and smashed Krillin's head into the ground
again.Kenji did a frontflip and landed on his feet.
Announcer:Well,I wouldn't want to meet Kenji in a dark alley!Krillin may not
get up from this
one!One...two...three...four...five...six...seven...eight...nine...ten!Kenji
wins!
Uriko:Told you.
Tenchi:Yeah,you weren't kidding.
Ryoko:So how many of these people are there?
Uriko:Well,there's Yugo,there's Mitsuko,there's my sister,and Long,my
teacher.
Ayeka:Well,not to worry,Lord Tenchi.I will put an end to this threat.
Uriko:Is that all I am to you?A threat?Well,for once,you're right.I'm a
threat to you!So watch out,Ayeka,cuz' Uriko is your next opponent!
Ayeka:Fine!But don't go crying home when I beat you!
Uriko:Don't bet on it,Ayeka!Cuz' if I don't beat you,Alice will!
Ayeka:Ooh,I'm scared!
Uriko:You better be!
Announcer:For the last time,if Ayeka or Uriko don't show up in five
seconds,you both will forfeit your match!
Ayeka and Uriko:We're right here!
Announcer:Ah,very good.Now......begin!
Ayeka instantly called up her logs,which zapped at Uriko.Uriko rolled and
counterattacked.She threw her shoulder right into Ayeka.Ayeka called up her
shield and Uriko went flying.She bounced off the ground and skidded towards
the edge.When she got up,there was a rough burn on her face.She flinched in
pain when she checked to see how bad it was.
Uriko:You'll pay for that!
Ayeka:We'll see.
Uriko,powered by rage,ran screaming at Ayeka.Just before she reached
her,Ayeka zapped.Smoke billowed from where Uriko was standing.When she
stopped and the smoke cleared,there was a cat toy on the ground.Ayeka picked
it up.There was a string and a piece of paper attached saying "Pull me
please!".Ayeka shrugged and pulled.A piece of paper was inside.It read "Nice
try!Sucker!" and next to it was a picture of Uriko pulling down her lower
left eye-lid and sticking her tongue out.BAM!Uriko elbowed Ayeka in the back
of the head.Ayeka fell on her face.She turned around and got up.
Ayeka:How did you do that?
Uriko:Bakaryu taught me.
Ayeka:Well,it won't help you all the time!
Uriko:Oh,no?watch me.
The two of them went at it for hours.(2 and a half.)After a while,Ayeka had
a plan for Uriko.
Ayeka:You're much tougher than I thought.
Uriko:So are you.
Ayeka:Well,why haven't you turned into a kitty-cat yet?
Uriko:I'm a HALF-BEAST!
She transformed.But while she was transforming,Ayeka sent an electric Jurain
attack her way.When the transformation was complete,Uriko looked the
same-minus the fact she was black and coughed smoke.
Uriko:RREEEOOOOOOWWWW!!
She ran at Ayeka and at the last second,jumped up and landed on her face.She
did a frontflip and kicked Ayeka out from underneath her feet.Uriko grabbed
her feet with her claws and her hands with her feet.They were stuck in the
air,flipping  like that for about five to ten seconds.Soon,a ball of energy
formed around them and Uriko launched the next phase of her attack.She threw
all of her weight in the other direction of her flipping,sending them both
hurtling around the arena,bouncing off walls and bouncing off the floor.When
Uriko decided it was time to stop,she went upward into the sky and slammed
into the floor,exploding the ball,and sending them both into the air.Uriko
landed on her butt,dizzy enough not to see strait,and Ayeka landed--outside
the arena.
Uriko:Hah!In your face Ayeka!You may talk the tough talk,but when it comes
right down to it,YOU CAN'T BEAT A CAT IN A FIGHT!
Ayeka:I lost?
Uriko:No.
Ayeka:No?
Uriko:I WON!
Announcer:Actually,you both lose.According to the rules,you both touched
outside of the arena,so that disqualifies both of you.
Uriko and Ayeka:WHAT?!
Announcer:I'm sorry,but rules are rules.You are both disqualified.
Tenchi:Well,at least this way they won't fight as often.
Ryoko:Yeah,that's just annoying.
Tenchi:Enter my world.
Ryoko:Hey!
Announcer:Next we have Shina and Yugo,both who,from what I've heard,are very
powerful fighters.This should prove interesting!
Out came an older looking man,wearing an orane vest,black shoes,brown
hair,and blue jeans.He had blue eyes and also wore brown motorcycle gloves.
Tenchi:That must be Yugo.So,he transforms also?
Uriko:Yeah.
>From behind him came a girl about Yugo's age.She dressed like Ryoko did;she
wore green jeans,a white tanktop,a pair of gray gloves like Yugo's,and an
orange strap around her left arm.She had blue eyes also,but her blond hair
looked...odd.It was spiked back,like her hair was being blown back from the
wind while on a very fast motorcycle.Guys sure liked her;they whistled and
whooped and cheered.
Guy in the crowd:Yeah baby!
Guy in the crowd 2:That's what daddy likes!
Another guy in the crowd:(Whistles loudly)
Yet another guy in the crowd:Walk this way!Right over here!
Shina:Oh,brother.You ready?
Yugo:Yep.Now don't expect me to go easy on you just because you're a girl!
Shina:Of course.I hope you don't expect the same from me.
Yugo:Why you little...
Announcer:Begin!
Yugo took a boxing posture,jumping back and forth.Shina launched a kick
combo,from which Yugo blocked almost all of them,except for when Shina
kicked him in the face.Blood erupted from his face as he fell.When he got
up,Shina smiled.
Yugo:You sure don't fight like a girl...
Ayeka,Uriko and Ryoko:Hey!
Shina:Well,I have lots of suprises in store.
Yugo:Enough stalling!
He got up and kicked her downward,right on top of the head.She blocked it
though.But while she used both of her hands to block it,Yugo punched her in
the stomach.She lost her breath and fell to her knees.Yugo grabbed her head
and,while jumping,shoved his knee in her face.She fell onto her back,blood
pretty much flowing from her nose.As she got up,Yugo ran at her.Just before
he could kick out of the ring,she uppercutted him and while in the
air,jumped and kicked him.He fell and landed on his back.When he opened his
eyes,Shina was standing above him,pitying him.He tripped her and when she
hit the ground,he kicked her in the back.Her shoulder skidded on the
concrete until she stopped.She slowly got up.Yugo only smiled.
Yugo:Pretty good.
Shina:Thanks.You're not too bad either.
Yugo:I'm afraid I'll have to beat you now.
Shina:Oh?And how do you plan on doing that?
Yugo:Like this!
A light erupted from Yugo,and when it cleared,it was the same as
Uriko's,only he was...
Tenchi:A wolf?
Exactly.
When Yugo looked at Shina,he was shocked.She had transformed almost the same
time as he had,only into a leapard.
Ryoko:This will be MUCH harder than I thought.
Tenchi:Oh,yeah.
Uriko:And you thought I was tough,just wait until you see Alice!
Tenchi:Who's that?
Uriko:My sister.
Yugo howled and launched at Shina.The two fought for a while,then Shina
blocked one of his punches,and decided to finish off Yugo.With her
other...paw,(Her claws grew to twice their size.)she sliced him across the
face,did that two more times with her paws switching each time.Then,she
uppercutted him upward,did a frontflip,stabbed and sliced several times,then
when Yugo hit the ground,Shina,in mid-air,moved both claws as if she was
moving two walls with her claws.And while she was too high for the claws to
reach,slash marks "magically" hit Yugo from the air.When Shina landed,she
was a human again.She made a fist,raised it high and yelled "Yeah!"
Yugo was still a wolf,however,and he had a few tricks up his sleeve as well.
He howled,ran at her and uppercutted her up into the air.She didn't go
far,though.So Yugo jumped up and hit her multiple times in the air,and when
they got really high,he bit her in the arm and propelled her down into the
arena.Now,like Shina,Yugo was a human again.With blood running down her
covered-up arm,Shina got up with a look on her face that expressed how much
pain she was in.Yugo was wounded also,only not in just one place,but in
several places.Although they were not as severe as Shina's arm,they still
hurt.
Yugo:Blast you!
Shina:That's my line.
Yugo:Well,you want me?Come and get me.
Shina:Be careful for what you wish for...
Shina ran as fast as she could at Yugo.(Keep in mind that she's
wounded.)Just before Shina rammed him into losing,he side-stepped her and
tripped her.But as she fell,she grabbed Yugo's arm and pulled him with
her.Unfortunatly,Tenchi and the others were right in the way,so they had to
dodge Yugo and Shina.Yugo was on top of Shina,both of them getting a little
too close.Their faces were only inches away from the others.At almost the
same time,they blushed.
Yugo:Uh,oops?
Shina:You won.
Yugo:Yeah,I did...
Both of them found each other getting closer and closer.Just before it
happened...
Uriko:Hi,Yugo!
Yugo looks up.
Yugo:Well,hi!How are you?
Uriko:Fine!I see I came at a bad time.
Shina:Not really...
Announcer:Well,looks to me like Yugo wins!
Shina:No offense,but COULD YOU PLEASE GET THE F*** OFF MY ARM?!!
Yugo:Oops!Sorry.
Yugo climbs off of Shina,who then walks into the resting area.
Yugo:That was not easy.
Uriko:Good to see you again.
Yugo:Yeah,you too,squirt.
Uriko:Don't call me that.
Yugo:Gott'ya.So,you are you?
Tenchi:I'm Tenchi,this is Ryoko,and this is Ayeka.
Yugo:Hi.
Ryoko:What's up?
Uriko:I think I know...
Yugo:Know what?
Uriko:Nothing.So,what was all that all about?
Yugo:What was what about?
Uriko:You know what I mean!You and Shina!I saw how you looked at her.
Yugo:You're nuts.
Ryoko:Actually,I agree.
Tenchi:Me too.
Yugo:Whatever!I'm out of here.
Tenchi:Where are you going?
Yugo:Somewhere so I can heal.
Yugo walks to the resting area.
Uriko:Ayeka?
Ayeka:What?
Uriko:Bet ya' $20.00 Yen he's going to see Shina!
Ayeka:You're on!

Shenlong:Shall we?
Busuzima:Yes.Let Phase 3 begin!

In the resting area...
*******************************************
Yugo was looking for Kenji when he noticed Shina,wrapping her arm in a
bandage.When she finished,she got up and headed for her private resting
room.Feeling childish,he followed her.Once she went inside,Yugo waited a few
minutes to make it seem that he just got there.After a little while,he
knocked on her door.
