        Part one the small blue planet
Cliff awoke that morning in his ship the....well he had forgotten his ship's
name mostly just called it his ship.He did his normal routine
shower,breakfast,bush teeth then he grabbed his sword then began cleaning
the
blood off of it.*A normal 17 year old would be going to school right now
but,
I'm far from normal. That last battle with Kojiro really got my sword
dirty.*He began cleaning Kojiro's blood off his sword.*How long have Kojiro
and I been fighting? Seems like years.....how long has Kagato dead? With him
gone that leaves me Kojiro and Ryoko,yep now we're the strongest
fightersaround.*Cliff then looked into the mirror. *Your face is a refection
of your soul,I think someone ounce said that.I think they were wrong* When
Cliff looked into the mirror he saw a handsome boy with blue eyes and long
brown hair.(For a boy that is.)He then looked at the medal he was
wearing.*Bah!I despise this thing. Why'd they give this to after training at
the monestairy?They said they give this to the truest of warriors but why
me!Aw well....better forget about it.Well now I guess now I'm the strongest
fighter in this little universe,well at lest I can die happy.What should I
do? What would mom say if she was alive right now?Now I should search for
love.*Cliff laughed at the mear thought of 'love'. *Now what should I do
realy
.Hey I bet the guy who beat Kagato is strong!* "Ship take me to the last
place Kagato's ship was seen." Then before the ship took off he buckled
himself in the pilot seat.His ship made it there quckly.All that was there
were debries. *Damm nothings here no clues no nothin about who killed
him.*Then his ship started to shake rapidly. "What the hell?!?Ship what
attacked us?" He saw Kojiro's ship the Yatsumi shooting at him. "Mha
hahahahahah!I shall become the strongest fighter!" "Gah Kojiro why don't
fight me like a man!" "I fight to win not for show." "DAMM IT!" Cliff's ship
fell to a small blue planet.
-----------------------------Meanwhile at the musaki
household-------------------------
"Lunch is ready!" Yelled out Sasami.And strangely everyone got to dinner on
time. "Ryoko I belive that rice ball is mine." "Hey this is the last one and
anyway it's mine." Then they got into another fight.Then they all stoped
everything they were doing and saw a meteor falling towrd earth.Then they
all
stared at Mihoshi and Kionne but they were surpirsed too.The meteor tuned
out
to be a ship and crashed into the water and then the house was ingluphed in
water for a moment.Then they saw a boy fall from the sky when he hit the
ground he created a small crator.Cliff got up from his fall as if nothing
happend. "Can I get my ship repaired?" Then he fainted. "Amazing he should
of
died on inpack." Said Washuu.
________________A few hours later__________________
"Where am I?" "Hey are you alright?" "I'm fine but where am I?" "You're in
our apartment Tenchi's house got too crowded.Mihoshi whaeres that water!?!"
Mihoshi came then triped and spilt hot water all over Cliff. "Gah!" Cliff
held out his palm about to shoot out a beam about to destroying
Mihoshi.
