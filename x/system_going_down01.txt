System going down...
Chapter1: No need for hard rock!
by: Richard "Shin Akuma" Valdez
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serj: Ah man! I shoulnd't have had all that sake last night

Daron: well, you've been pucking for about the last 12 hours

Shavo: Hey Look! There's tokyo you guys.
       (the members of the band look down at toykyo tower awaiting a huge gig)

John: Oh man I'm gonna be sick. All that damn sake and rice is
      getting to me.
 
        (Sweat drops on the other 3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The maski shrine opens on a sunny warm day. Tenchi still lives

at the shrine, but not by himself in a manner or speaking.

You see tenchi still had many feelings for his one time love,

haruna and with the help of Kasihito and some of washu supirior

Brain power, Haruna returns to the land of the living. It proved

that Tenchi's love for haruna was stronger than death and nothing

could change that. Sometime after the first encounter with haruna

Tenchi began to have dreams of her and old feeling began to surface

which interfered in tenchi's normal life. This reawakened haruna

and put her back at square 1. Now both were in love, for real 

this time. Kasihito knew that this was destiny for both, no matter

how much he knew it would hurt. Kasihito knew it was for the best.

With this washu was able to clone a body for haruna with her

concent to dig up her remains and use what ever DNA washu could

find to make the body. Kasihito would then use his power to bond

haruna's soul to her new body. He knew tenchi would give haruna

the life that she could not spend with yosho. This night both tenchi

and haruna have found the peace that each sought for so long.

maybe now thigs will get back to normal.(Yeah right)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
it's been over 6 months since that very fateful night and 5 since haruna

and tenchi were wed. (Much to the ill manner of ryoko & aeka.) The

carnival that is the maseki house has not gotten any better but it 

has become quite different. Now with haruna around the girls fight

more for the attention of tenchi.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now tenchi's life begin's it's next chapter and the carnival of 

the maseki house has no plans to stop anytime soon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
it's dinner time and tenchi is coming home from the shrine.

Tenchi: haruna, haruna I'm home {Now where is she?}

the smell of dinner filled the air as tenchi walks to the kitchen and

finds haruna and sasamei finishing a very promicing dinner.

Haruna: Oh tenchi I didn't her you come in. i was so worried!
       [She wraps herself around tenchi]

Tenchi: There's nothing to be worried about now. I'm home and just

        Glad to see my loving wife and family after such a hard day.

        What could be better.

Haruna: just wait and see my love!

Sasamei: Dinner is almost ready. I need to hurry. i have a test to study for and
      
         I have to get for class at 6.[Giant sweat drop appers]

Ryoko & Aeka: No it's mine hussy! Give those, thier mine you bitch!

Tenchi: You would think they would have grown up by now.

[sweat drop appers on haruna and tenchi]
