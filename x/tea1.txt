A Cup Of Coffee

A Tenchi Muyo!, El-Hazard, Sailor Moon crossover (yes, it can be done)

************************************************************************************************************************

SCENE:  A booth at a coffee house.  Sitting there are Tenchi (TM!), Makoto (El Hazard)
  and Mamoru (SMR).  All are looking at menus and just enjoying their time off.

MAKOTO:  God, it feels good to be back!  I've wanted a decient cup of coffee for
 months!

MAMORU:  So how was Roshtaria?

MAKOTO:  Bad guys galore.  Raging lesbians.  Tons of beautiful women trying to sleep
 with me.  Wierd bug things that wanted my blood.  Lots of royalty that was off its rocker.

TENCHI:  Been there.

MAMORU:  Done that.

(They sip their coffee)

MAKOTO:  So, anything happen while I was gone?

MAMORU:  Naw, I ended up with Usagi for the gazilliontih time, the city was destroyed
 several times...

TENCHI:  ...several space priates, Aeka was kidnapped seven times, Sasami hasn't
 slept well for the past six weeks and yesterday grandpa beat the crap out of me in
 practice.

MAKOTO:  I hear ya.  Mr. Fujisawa can be a real bear to practice with when he's sober.

MAMORU:  He's sober?

MAKOTO:  The times are few and far between.

TENCHI:  Probally the same number of times Ryoko isn't trying to get me in the sack.

MAMORU:  I never understood that.  You've got all these beautiful women wanting to
 sleep with you, yet you remain chaste.  How the hell do you pull it off?

MAKOTO:  How did you keep it in your pants when Rei threw herself at you?

MAMORU:  Simple.  I thought about what would happen if she got knocked up.  Would
 you want to spend the rest of your life with a pissy Shinto priest when both of you are
 immortal?

MAKOTO&TENCHI:  There.  You.  Go.

MAMORU:  Okay.  Pop quiz:  if you were sutck on a desert isle with a senshi...

ALL:  Venus.

MAMORU:  Everyone always answers that the same way....

MAKOTO:  Say, isn't she...you know...

MAMORU:  Let's just not go there.  I can't tell who's straight and whose not anymore.  If
 I didn't have Usagi, I'd be up the creek.

MAKOTO:  Amen.

TENCHI:  Am I the only guy surrounded by beautiful alien women that aren't lesbians?

MAKOTO&MAMORU:  Shaddup.

TENCHI:  Hey, at least you got one of them to actually fall for you, Makoto.

MAKOTO:  Yeah, when I'm dressed in drag and wrapped in a cat.

MAMORU:  Why are all cute animals with magical powers in some way cat-like?

(A dead silence)

TECNHI:  I.... don't know.

MAKOTO:  That's a really good point, Mamrou.

MAMORU:  That's one of those things thats kept me up at night.  Why no dogs,
 chimps, fish or any other type of animal?  Its always cats!

TENCHI:  Or cabbits.

MAMORU:  Scary, ain't it?  Its one of those things you should ask Washu about.  Even Luna and Artamis were kinda stumped by that one.

TENCHI:  Amazingly enough, why is it that all magical cats can talk?

MAMORU:  Its just one of their amazing powers!

MAKOTO:  Hey, if I remember correctly, all your cats do IS talk!  I' on the other hand have my own personal body armor.

TENCHI:  Got that topped.

MAMORU:  How.

TENCHI:  Ryo-ohki?  Shes a space ship.  Plus she looks damn good in humanoid form.

MAKOTO&MAMORU:  Hmmm....   

TENCHI:  You two start getting hentai on me and I'll whomp on both of you.

MAKOTO:  Okay, okay, gomen.  

(They each sip their coffee)

MAMORU:  So Tenchi, how'd you manage to ditch your little fan club?

TENCHI:  (Grinning)  I told them we were going to the beach tomorrow and to each pick
 up a new bathing suit while we were in town.

MAKOTO:  You didn't...

MAMORU:  Oh shimatta.

TENCHI:  What?  What's wrong with that?

MAKOTO:  Nothing, except that...um...

MAMORU:  Guess where I sent Usagi and the gang.

MAKOTO:  While you're at it, take a guess where Ifurita and the gals are.

TENCHI:  Hmm.  I see.  Well, it WAS a nice shopping mall.

MAMORU:  Hey Makoto, I know Shayla-Shayla has the hots for you, and Miz is hooked
 up with Fujisawa, so why didn't you ever make a move on Afura-Mann?

MAKOTO:  Same reason you don't make a move on Neptune or Uranus.

TENCHI:  You mean...

MAMORU:  ...her too?

MAKOTO:  Yep.  Just don't say anything.  No one's suspossed to know.

TENCHI:  Secret's safe here.

MAMORU:  Ditto.

(They each sip their coffee)

MAMORU:  Do you guys ever get tired of it all?

MAKOTO:  WHat do you mean?

MAMORU:  You know.  The beautiful women.  The constaint bickering.  Aliens and
 baddies popping out of the woodwork trying to kill you for Kami only knows what, having
 to get up at all hours of the night to fight off Youmma... do you guys ever get tired of it
 all?

(They think about it)

ALL:  Naw.

MAKOTO:  Hey, at least you two have super powers that are cool and costumes to go
 with them.  Look what I'm stuck with!

TENCHI:  Hey, my costume looks like something out of a Barbie catalouge, thank you
 very much.  Besides, my power kicks in only when I'm seriously up the creek.

MAMORU:  Hey, at least you've got some real power!  You've got that light saber 
thingie!  All I've got is a rose and a cane.  Now I admit, when you can take down 
a three ton beast with these items, it does make you look cool, but come on!  
Give me a gun any day!

TENCHI:  Hear hear!  Besides Makoto, you've got powers too.  What are you
 complaining about?

MAKOTO:  Ohh gee.  What a power.  I can turn stuff on and off.  So I can operate the
 Eye of God.  Big whoop.  I can't really DO anything with it, unless I want to blow up half
 of Roshtaria with it which I did, thank you very much!

TENCHI:  Sorry.  

MAMORU:  Bummer.

MAKOTO:  Not really, it was Diva's side.

(Grins all around)

TECNHI:  Why is it that we live so close to eachother, yet we each have different bad
 guys?

MAMORU:  I dunno.  Let's ask Ranma when he gets here.

TENCHI:  I wonder, since we hang out together, do you think the girls do too?

MAKOTO:  Hmm, I don't know.  It's possible...

MAMORU:  Sure, why not?  Rei and Shayla-Shayla would hit it off just fine.

(They sip their coffee.  Suddenly, an explosion can be heard from outside.  They all look
 out with bored expressions on their faces)

MAMORU:  Hmm.  Looks like our girls DID meet eachother.

MAKOTO:  Yeah, I guess so.  ~sigh~

TENCHI:  You guys think we should do something about it?

ALL:  Naw.

(A gaggle of girls pours through the door of the coffee shop, several are covered in soot
 and all are carrying shopping bags.  The three groups of ladies seem to be screaming
 at each other)

MAMORU:  Well, I guess its time to go.

MAKOTO:  Yep.  I got the check.

TENCHI:  Thanks Makoto.  Same time next week guys?

MAMORU:  If I'm still alive.

MAKOTO:  Ditto.

************************************************************************************************************************ 

Well, I'm done.  This is probaly the oddist, most pointless piece I've ever put together.
  Plus, my protrayl of these three heros may seem....off.  Well, so what?  Its a gag. 
 Just enjoy it, and if you don't, well, I'm sorry.
