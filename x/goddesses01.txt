1 - PROLOGUE

(takes place 1 day after the final battle w/ Galaxia):
"Usagi, you saved us all," Rei said as a tear ran down her cheek.  She
turned her head and began to cry more.  "Forgive me, I doubted you."
Usagi looked at Rei and flung her arms around her.  She squeezed her so
tight; Reis face began to turn purple.  Usagi held the choking Rei for a
moment until Makoto and Minako popped up.
"Uh Usagi, you better let go of her or shell die," a worried Makoto said.  A
hurt look spread over Usagi's face as she reluctantly let go of Rei.  It
took the girl a minute to catch her breath.
"Jeez, Usagi, you could have killed me!"
"Oh yeah, Rei, well at least I dont yell."
"Yes you do!"
"Do not!"
"Do to!"  The two girls began to make faces at each other as they called out
rude names.  Makoto and Minako were sitting in the grass, wondering what the
heck was going on.
"Won't you two ever grow up?" a voice said sternly from behind a bush.  Rei
and Usagi stopped there arguing as Ami appeared. Luna and Artemis were
behind her.
"Imb growb ub!" Rei said, Usagi's fingers still stretching her cheeks out to
the side. "Leb go, Odango-heab!" she yelled as she pushed Usagi over on the
grass.
Usagi stood up and gave Rei one last evil look, then turned to Ami, Luna,
and Artemis and said, "I'm so glad everyone is okay!"  Usagi rushed over to
Ami and gave her, Luna, and Artemis all one big hug.  Ami's face turned so
bright it began to match the color of her hair.
"Nice to see you too," Luna panted.  Artemis ran over to Minako and got on
her shoulder.  Minako hugged him gently and he began to purr.
"So what do we do since there is no bad guys to fight?  Will you all still
be my friends?" Makoto asked.
"Yes, of course we will, Ami replied.  We are best friends forever."
Usagis face began to sadden.  Tears started to stream from her eyes, and all
of the sudden she began to cry and yell really loud.  The cats and the other
girls covered their ears.
"What is wrong with you, Usagi?" Makoto asked sympathetically.  "Stop crying
and tell us."
"I miss everyone! Michiru, Haruka, Setsuna, Chibi-Usa, Hotaru, the
Starlights, and I especially miss Chibi-Chibi! Waaaaaaa!"
"Well, then, we could ask Michiru, Haruka, Setsuna and Hotaru over someday,
if you want. They only live on the other side of the city," Ami tried to
explain.  It was hard to raise her soft voice over the deafly noise Usagi
was making.
Amazingly, Usagi completely stopped her balling.  "Ye - Yes, okay.  We can
go see them every once in a while."
"Is there something else, Usagi?" Makoto asked.
"Yes Well, Mamoru Mamoru has to go back to the United States next month."
"Awe, we are so sorry!" Minako said.
"Im not," Rei whispered to herself.  She snickered.  Now Usagi couldnt brag
about having a boyfriend.
"How long will he be there?" Makoto joined in.  For some reason, this
question made Usagi cry again.
"A year!"
"Wow thats a long time!" Ami commented.  She looked at Luna who was leaning
on Artemis.  How cute they looked together!  Just like Usagi and Mamoru
looked so cute together.
"Don't worry, he'll be back before you know it."  Makoto smiled and nodded
to Minako.  Rei was still sitting by the tree scowling.  Minako walked over
to her and tapped her on the shoulder.
"You should be nice, you know Usagi saved our lives yesterday."
Rei took a deep breath and let it out.  "I know."  Rei got up and turned to
Usagi and hugged her gently.  "It'll be okay.  We love you, Usagi."
Usagi felt love and compassion overwhelm her as the rest of her friends
joined in on the hug.
"Makoto... Mina... Ami... Rei... I love you too!" Usagi felt atear of
happiness run down her cheek. She knew the five of them would remain best
friends forever, even to death.
(I know that was a lil boring, but there were some things you have to know,
and the Tenchi part is better so keep reading!)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ayeka sat up in bed and yawned.  She stretched her arms to the ceiling and
wiggled her fingers free of the early-morning muscle tightness.  For once
she was eager to get out of bed, but she also was nervous. Tenchi was
leaving that day.  How could she bare to live without him?
A month ago, Mihoshi and Kiyone had moved to the twelth ring of Saturn
because of their job.  After getting a promotion they could no longer stay
on Earth.  Ayeka was reluctant to admit she missed them, but she really did.
Now that Tenchi was going away, she would either be completely bored, or
fighting with Ryoko all of the time.
Ayeka dressed and ran quickly tothe dining room to have her breakfast.
She was too late.
Washu and Ryoko had their cheeks stuffed with breakfast; Sasami was standing
in the kitchen doorway with her apron on; Ryo-Ohki was gnawing away on sweet
cooked carrots; and poor Tenchi was sitting at the head of the table with
nothing in his dish.  Tenchi had an empty seat beside him, so Ayeka
immediately seized the opportunity. Ryoko gave her a quick evil glance, but
that was gone in a second and Ryoko continued gorging herself with food.
"It's gonna be a regular day," Tenchi sighed.
"No it is not.  You are leaving."  Tears began to well up in Ayekas eyes.
She sat there for a moment trying to hold them back, but finally burst into
tears.  "OH TENCHI!  Why do you have to go to the city towork?  Why cant you
work here?"
"You know I'll come back during the weekends, Ayeka!" Tenchi choked as he
tried to pull Ayekas arms away from around him.
"But I dont think I can stand you being gone for a week!"
"You do want me to make money to support us, right?"
"But your father works!"
"Not enough to support all seven of us."
"True."  A tear dropped from Ayekas eye. Ryoko noticed this, and jealously
threw a strawberry right between Ayekas eyes.  Ayeka became infuriated and
threw one right back.  Tenchi, realizing this wasnt the perfect place to
have a serious conversation, dragged Ayeka outside.  The sun was shining and
it was already hot.
"Ayeka, I have something to show you."
Tenchi led the tear-flooded girl into woods and by a little patch of moss.
The moss was oddly shaped like a shield, and even more odd, there was a
light-pink seedling growing in the center of it.  Tenchi hesitated for a
moment and just looked at the seedling.  He gently put his fingers around
the one leaf of the seedling, wavered there for a minute, and almost
reluctantly pulled it, and easily came off of the beautiful little plant.
Ayeka was still sobbing as he opened her hand and placed the leaf right into
it.  As soon as it touched her hand, it turned green.  Ayeka gasped.
"What is..."
"I will always be in your heart," Tenchi said as he touched her chest where
her heart was, and felt the rhythm of its beat on his fingers.  "With this
leaf off a sacred seedling, you will never forget me.  Keep it with you
always."
Ayeka grasped the leaf and held it close to her heart.
"Dont worry, I'll be back at the end of every week.  If you ever feel like
you are endangered, just touch this leaf, and you will be safe."
It began to drizzle lightly.  Water dripped from the leaves of the trees far
above.  One landed directly on Ayeka's nose, and she blushed as Tenchi wiped
it off with his finger.  He smiled at her warmly.
Tenchi stood up, and offered Ayeka a hand.  They walked back to the house
and Ayeka went directly to her room, and did not come back out to say good
bye to Tenchi.
