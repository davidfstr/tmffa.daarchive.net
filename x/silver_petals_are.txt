			SILVER PETALS ARE REALLY F***** UP
A fanfic with Sailor Moon, Tenchi Muyo!, Beavis and Butthead, South Park, and OTHERS...


MR GARRISON: Ok children, there's going to be a fire drill soon, and you'll all have to corporate. Any Questions?
KENNY: Mphf mmmf phf
MR GARRISON: No.

The class is sent outside for the drill
.
MR GARRISON: OK class, now we'll all go back in now and-
WENDY: HOLY S***! The school's on fire!

The school was on fire. The fire became a national tragedy. Beavis and Butthead saw the building on fire in their home, while they should've been at school.

BUTTHEAD: The school's on fire. Heh heh.
BEAVIS: Cool. Heh heh .
BUTTHEAD: Look. There's some little kid buying a dirty magazine!
BEAVIS: DUDE! Where they live is cool.
BUTTHEAD: We must visit this 'South Park'

The two boys buy two tickets to South Park on a bus. Then they
have to watch Drew Carry on the TV.

BUTTHEAD: Fat guys are cool.

They finally reach South Park. Then they see Kenny buying a dirty magazine.

BEAVIS: Hey. Didn't that dude search you or anything?
KENNY: Mmppphfh fmmrnb.
MAG. SELLER: It's ok, I don't give a rat's ass.
BUTTHEAD: You'll cool, dude. Heh heh.

Officer Barbrady then sees the three boys.

OFFICER BARBRADY: Excuse me boys, aren't you supposed to be at the high school?
BUTTHEAD: Uh, no.
OFFICER BARBRADY: You need to go to school! 

The two kids are sent to the high school.

PRINCIPAL: Hey! Those two dumbasses don't even go to this school!
VICE PRINCIPAL: Well...since these two retards are special, send them to the elementary school.

Beavis and Butthead are sent to Mr. Garrison's third grade class.

MR. GARRISON: OK students, we have two retarded children in our class today. Please give them the ridicule they deserve. Their names are Beavis and Butthead.
STAN: Hah! You guys are 'special!'
CARTMAN: Yeah, you're all dumber than Stan's dog!
STAN: Shut up, fat ass!
CARTMAN: Don't you repress me, dildo!
KYLE: Ahh, you jiggle too much fat boy!
BEAVIS: Fat guys are cool, you skinny f***!
BUTTHEAD: Yeah, you dildo.
CARTMAN: Yeah, united we shall never be defeated!
KENNY: Mpphf m,m!
BEAVIS: Oh, yeah, I remember you! You're the kid who bought the dirty magazines!
MR. GARRISON: OK boys, settle down. Now, children, you'll have to write an essay about
                               Japan. Write a better one than you dumbasses usually write and we'll be 
                               eligible for a trip there.
WENDY: Cool!

A week later the class reads their essays.

CARTMAN: The most important economy in Japan are video games called RPGs. 
                      RPGs are video games about Japanese mice drinking scotch. 
MR. GARRISON: Good essay Eric. B+.
CARTMAN: Sweeet.
MR. GARRISON: Who's up next? It's Beavis and Butthead.
B&B: Our report is on Japan. They have...sss...lan..slan...tid...heh heh...slanted eyes.
           The end.
MR. GARRISON: Thank you boys, for that f***** up report. F+.
BUTTHEAD: Cool.

Wendy won the contest for the trip a month later.

MR. GARRISON: OK children, remember your tickets tomorrow. 
MR. HAT: That's right Mr. Garrison.
CARTMAN: F*** Mr. Hat.

The class gets on a train to Tokyo, Japan.

WENDY: Are we supposed to get on a train instead of a plane?
MR. GARRISON:....
MR. HAT: S***!
The class goes on a plane to Tokyo.

MR. GARRISON: OK, class, we're here.
A WEIRD LOOKING MOUSE: Pikachu!
CARTMAN: Hey! 
PIKACHU: Chaaa!
STAN: Hey! That's Pikachu!
KYLE: You scared him, fat boy!
MR. GARRISON: Looks like our guides are here.
TWO GUIDES: Hello! I'm Kiyone, and this is my partner Mihoshi.
                           We are going to be you're guides for the week you're here.
                           Any questions? Yes, you in the red coat.
KENNY: Mpphf mmm umk oooh?
KIYONE: ?
MIHOSHI: SO ADOREABLE!
BUTTHEAD: Hey, baby...wanna sit on papa Butthead's lap?
BEAVIS: NO! ME!!

The boys slap each other.

WENDY: Could you tell us about yourselves?
MIHOSHI: Well, I'm a space detective, and we live in an apartment, and we're friends with
                    the most intelligent mind in the world, the princesses of Jurai, a demon...
KIYONE: SHAD-UP!!
CARTMAN: Hey, Mr. Garrison, where are we sleeping tonight?
MR. GARRISON: In the 'Washu Hotel.'
CARTMAN: Cool!

The next day...

KIYONE: This is a shrine to the gods. This is one of the owners of the
                  establishment, Rei. Rei, may you please take over?
REI: Sure thing. Now as you can see...

All of a sudden...a bunch of monsters appear!

MONSTERS: We are the Triano Squad! We shall destroy the world!

A bunch of sailors appear!

SAILOR: I AM SAILOR MOON!
SAILOR: AND I'M SAILOR MARS!
SAILOR: AND I'M SAILOR HAT!
MR. GARRISON: MR. HAT!!!
SAILOR HAT: All, alright...
SAILOR MOON: Those monsters are too powerful? What can we do?
SOME GUY IN A TUXEDO: Hi, girls! Need some help?
SAILOR MOON: TUXEDO MASK! You're here!
TUXEDO MASK: (Throws a rose, which hits Kenny)
STAN: Ohmigod! They killed Kenny!
KYLE: You bastard!
CARTMAN: I'm gonna kick you in the nuts you dildo!

Cartman kicks Tuxedo Mask in the nuts.

SAILOR MOON: NOOOO!
CARTMAN: And you monsters! I'm gonna kick you in the nuts too!

A portal opens!

TRIANO SQUAD: NOOOOO!

And in their place...a Tomagotchi, some spiky haired dude, some
dinosaurs, and...THE POWER RANGERS AND BARNEY?

KYLE: Dude, those dinosaurs are from The Land Before Time! Remember that movie?
LITTLEFOOT: Where are we...?
SARA: I don't know...
SPIKY HAIRED DUDE: (Holds tag that says 'My Name Is Crono')
SARA: Can you speak?
CRONO: (Shakes Head)
TOMAGOTCHI: Bleep!
BARNEY: Where are my friends...?
STAN: Those Power Rangers are from the first cast!
RED RANGER: We must get back to our own time!
LITTLEFOOT: Which is four years ago, dumbass.
KEYONE: This is weirder than what happened to us... 
BEAVIS: What do you mean, baby...
KIYONE: Well, we're friends with a demon made by the greatest scientific genius in the 
                  World, some princesses from Jurai, and a poor guy that most of these girls are
                   in love with.
BUTTHEAD & STAN: So?
SARA: I understand...
TOMAGOTCHI: Bleep!

The portal spews out three more guests. Two girls and a guy.

GIRL 1: Crono! The portals are open again!
GIRL 2: Cloud! What are we doing here?
GUY WHO MAY BE CLOUD: Where is this place?!
GIRL 1: I'm Lucca.
GIRL 2: I'm Tifa.
GUY: I'm...Cloud.
WENDY: WHO'S THAT?!

The whole gang sees a woman with a transparent keyboard.

WOMAN: Why, little girl! I'm Washu! I believe you stayed at my inn!
WENDY: Oh...
LUCCA: We need to sort this out. Now, some of you are from different times and
                dimensions right?
ALL: (Nodding)
WASHU: There's someone disrupting the dimensions. We must stop it!
WENDY: Yes. There's something wrong. Washu, can you figure it out?
WASHU: Of course! I'm the greatest mind in the universe!
LUCCA: We must know who's who.
TIFA: Cloud and I came from Midgar, in the year 2097.
SARA: Littlefoot and I came from...I think it was the 1,097,697th year from The 
            Great Valley.
LUCCA: Crono and I came from 1006 AD from Guardia.
TIFA: That Tomagotchi came from our time!
POWER RANGERS: We came from here, just a few years ago.
BARNEY: Why, I must say that is true of me too!
KYLE: This class went to Japan for a trip here. We're from this time.
KIYONE: Washu and I are from this time too.
BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD: We'll go anywhere you're goin...heh heh...
SAILOR MOON: Mars, Tuxedo, and I are from here, too.
WASHU: We must all unite to defeat the entity. Then you'll all go home.
                 I will work on how to find it. Lucca, Wendy, will you come with me?
                 For now enjoy the visit here. Because of this you'll get 10% off my hotel fees!
LUCCA: Ahhhh! What is it?

Lucca sees Kenny get up.

WASHU: Interesting...it is immortal. I will need you too.
KENNY: Yay!
STAN: WHAT?!
KENNY: I can speak now! Now I feel so free!
CARTMAN: Shut-up dildo!

Later at the Washu Hotel's dining room...

CARTMAN: I want some CHEESY POOFS!
WASHU: There you go!
CARTMAN:....SWEEET...
BARNEY: Got any cookies, Miss Washu?
WASHU: Just call me 'Little Washu!'
BARNEY: OK Little Washu! Got cookies?
WASHU: Sure thing!
BARNEY: Thank you!
CRONO: (Holding sign that says 'Jerky')
WASHU: Here you go!

Washu goes back to her lab with Lucca, Wendy, and Kenny.

WASHU: Hmmm...Wendy, why are you here?
WENDY: I won an essay contest. Now my class is here, too.
LUCCA: Who ran this contest?
WENDY:...Some guy called 'Shin Trine'
LUCCA & WASHU: SHIN TRINE?!
LUCCA: He's a Naiku Devil!
WASHU: Yes.
LUCCA: Where is he?
WENDY: Ask Kenny.
WASHU: Kenny. Where's Shin Trine?
KENNY: At that cave.

Kenny points to a tall cave.

WASHU: That's never been there before!?

Kiyone rushes in the room.

KIYONE: That kid's mouth! It's spreading a virus!
WASHU: WHAT?!
WENDY: Look at Tifa!
TIFA: Cough...(Vomits)
WASHU: Kill it!
KENNY: No! My voice...mmphf!
TIFA: I'm better!
LUCCA: The virus in that boy's mouth...that's why it was covered...
WASHU: Call the others back. Time to confront Shin Trine...

Everyone goes back to Washu's lab.

WASHU: We know now who's responsible for this.
LUCCA: Shin Trine.
WASHU: We must send our best fighting teams there.
LUCCA: Crono, Cloud, and Tifa are going. We need seven more.
CARTMAN: I shall go.
KYLE: Shut-up fat ass!
BARNEY: I'll be more than happy to battle the one responsible for this.
RED RANGER: I shall depart for battle.
LUCCA: Two more.
BUTTHEAD: I shall go and wield the Butthawk Sword.
LITTLEFOOT: I'll go too, and I'll bring the Tomagotchi, around my neck.
TOMAGOTCHI: I have evolved...My rays shall defeat Shin Trine.
SAILOR MOON: I'll go.
WASHU: OK. I'll warp you all there.

The selected few go to the cave. 

CARTMAN: Cough...this place sucks...
BUTTHEAD: What do we do now?
CRONO: (Holds sign that says 'Go to cave and kill Shin Trine'
TOMAGOTCHI: We depart now.
SAILOR MOON: We'll take some weapons. Anyone with weapons?
CARTMAN: My trusty Cheesy Poof 7 Omega Gun.
BUTTHEAD: The Butthawk Sword.
LITTLEFOOT: This Tomagotchi.
CRONO: (Holds sign that says 'Rainbow Sword')
RED RANGER: My zord.
BARNEY: The Instant Death Spectrum.
TIFA: My fists.
CLOUD: My Ultima Weapon.
SAILOR MOON: My tiara.
TIFA: That's everyone.
CLOUD: Let's go.

Then they find a gang of goblins!

SAILOR MOON: Triano Squad?!
TRIANO SQUAD: It's us! We challenge your team to a fight to the death!
CARTMAN: Eat this, you tree-huggin hippies!

Cartman pulls out his Cheesy Poof Gun!

CARTMAN: That'll teach you to respect MY ATOR-ITAH!
BUTTHEAD: I summon the Butthawk Sword!

Butthead swings the long sword towards one of the goblins.

TIFA: FINAL HEAVEN DEATHBLOW!
CLOUD: OMINISLASH!
CRONO: (Crono performed LUMINIAIRE!)
LITTLEFOOT: I think they're dead now.

More goblins appear!

RED RANGER: Come my MEGAZORD! Swing the giant sword!

The goblins scream. It must sting...

LITTLEFOOT: Look! Godzilla!

Godzilla performs his radioactive breath on the Triano Squad!

LITTLEFOOT: one more...Tomagotchi! GO!There's 
TOMAGOTCHI: Sting rays! GO!
SAILOR MOON: MOON TIARA...ELIMINATION!
BUTTHEAD: Those assmunches are dead...heh heh...cool.
LUCCA: Lucca, here, come in! Can you read me?
CARTMAN: What is it? You really bug me with those big ass glasses.
STAN: Damnit fatty! Lucca and Washu have something to say that's really
             important!
CARTMAN: What is it?!
LUCCA: Shin Trine is near you! Someone must stay behind to fend the remaining monsters!
CLOUD: The Red Ranger and I will stay back to fight the rest of the goblins!
TIFA: Don't you die on me, Cloud!

The rest goes through a corridor to fight Shin Trine.

BARNEY: Shin Trine! Taste this! 


Barney gives Shin Trine a taste of his Instant Death Spectrum!


BARNEY: Vengeance for my recent low ratings!
BUTTHEAD: Duo Butthawk sword! I summon...heh heh heh...

Butthead slashes away at the Naiku Demon!

TIFA: Why isn't it attacking?
CRONO: (Holds sign that says 'It isn't our enemy!')
WASHU: Come in! Do NOT attack Shin Trine! The real enemy is...
TIFA: Who?!
WASHU: The US Godzilla!
TIFA: WHAT?!
WASHU: It's coming right for you!

Shin Trine got up...and it's...dying?!

SAILOR MOON: Shin Trine is killing itself? Why?
WASHU: It would rather die than kill it's...mother.
TIFA: The US Godzilla is this demon's mother?!
CARTMAN: That bitch! I'll kick her in the nuts for making such a suck-ass movie!

Cartman kicks the monster in the nuts!

LITTLEFOOT: You retard! It's after us now!
BARNEY: I've had enough! Godzilla! It's time for us to show that American disgrace
                   our TRUE FORM!
TOMAGOTCHI: They're merging! 
STAN: Dude! Are you there? That's VOLTRON!
BEAVIS: Voltron kicks ass.
KYLE: Leave it to Voltron! You guys! GET OUT NOW!!!

Everyone leaves to let Voltron kick the monster's ass!

CARTMAN: Whoa.
MR GARRISON: That was a sucky trip...

Barney and Godzilla were dead. They kicked ass, too. The Tenchi gang went on
to star in more films. Sailor Moon went back to her bed, eatin' cookies. Cloud and The Red Ranger were safe, and everyone went home. As for Beavis and Butthead...

BEAVIS: That sucked.
BUTTHEAD: We didn't even get any magazines.
BEAVIS: I can't believe they made us go home.
BUTTHEAD: At least we got to keep the spiky haired dude.
CRONO: (Holds sign that says 'Nachos are...sweeet.')
