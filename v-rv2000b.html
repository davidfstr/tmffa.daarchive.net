I'm only voting for fics that have been updated in the voting period, so
I can't vote for some of my favorites (Confess to You, Aikan Muyo). Still,
I found all five of these fics very enjoyable: "009" is rapidly becoming
one of my favorite fanfic writer .<br/>

<b>Comments:</b><br/>
.... For the first time since EDT wrote Ryouko's Love, I feel that I can
not vote it #1... I remember having a fight awhile back with someone in the
room about voting for newer fics, and to stop being one of those that dont
even bother to vote for anyone new, giving them a chance Holding to my opinion
that he was the best and rightfully I had good reason, I mean... he use to
win EVERY time, however as I started reading "Confess to you": bows to Literary
Eagle: ", "Happy Birthday Ryoko" -CAV, "Destiny's Ba ance" -Davner "damn
good show my friend!" HOW could I make EDT's fic first? THIS BY FAR IS NOT
A PERSONALY ATTACK ON EDT, he is a good friend of mine and I don't wish it
to be felt that it is.... It is a PUSH!. It is still my deep feeling that
"Ryouko' Love" should not suffer the fate of many other GREAT works of fiction.
. I understand the need for creative control and creative expansion however
I cannot sit and watch a Fic that once ruled the charts and was used as
inspiration for hundreds of other fanfic writers ^_^ . Go the way of the
do-do-bird..... I took the time to read Everyone's comments. : Points out
some important things from some: Charlie Godson - 03/16/00 01:33:10 Comments:
"I am a Ryoko fan and totally love Ryokos Love, but there needs to b more
to the story for the transition"<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Wizard31 - 04/18/00 17:07:42 Favorite Tenchi FF #2: Ryoko's Love Comments:
"I still think that evildrtran should finish writing the Alpha series of
Ryoko's Love. It is just plain wrong to Leave it unfinished, especially at
that point."<br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
But on a better note, and keeping with the idea of voting for newer Fics
This year i make "Destiny's Balance" #1 #2 will be "Ryouko's Love" EDT makes
it Number one again! #3 will be "confess to you" :: bows deeply to lita"
#4 will be "Happy birthday Ryuoko" #5 will be "NO Need for Sassami" I wish
everyone luck this season<br/>

Well I tried to vote for newer fics this season unlike other times. Sheesh,
been so long voting I almost forgot how. ^^;;;; Anyway, I love all these
fics, Hands of Fate is so beautifully poetic, and Twilight Dreams-- so sad
but true. Needs a bit of techni al help, but it won me over anyway. Confess
to You, I don't think I need to say anything about that one ^_^ you all know
it. "No Need for the Loves of Heaven and Earth" Was very very nice. I read
this one a while ago and liked it, lots. "To Love and To Ha e" is my fave
of the new ones, it has *so* much potential. Moving... on... I haven't read
all of "Destiny's Balance" (it's so long...) but I'll get there. It won a
vote off me as soon as I started, sucked me right in! Cool setting cool plot,
cool romance! Good work Dav. Sad thing is, I wouldn't have started reading
this if I wasn't in it. (The length of it scared me at first). Yes everyone,
"Lezell Charis" is based on me... ^^;;;; Seeing the popularity of this fic
I feel the need to comment about it. "Leze l" is based on me, but only a
little because believe me, I am *really* a very very nice person. (No really,
ask Dav if you don't believe me.) "Lezell" is based on my "Evil" persona
(twin sis, actually) I used in #TenchiFF one night. I hope you all don't
t ink I'm some sort of b*&amp;ch now or something, after reading "DB" because
really i'm not! ^_^;;;; Thats all. I thought I should say something before
I start getting hate mail or something or people start boycotting my fics...
^^; You might think i'm paranoi , but, I'm a bit weary since "Lezell" is
so evil that even I hate myself, almost ^^;;;;;; So keep in mind... it's
not really me! ;_;! Thanks. Thats all folks! Lesell (Not to be confused with
Lezell) Charis<br/>

Okay, well, my older sister voted earlier and caused somewhat of a ruckus.
I don't think she meant to put anyone down, she just wondered why four different
people voted for each others fics. And I don't think she meant it as a personal
attack on anyone's case. I know for a fact that friends vote for friends.
Whether they mean to or not. I apoligize on her behalf to anyone who was

Gensao should require that people vote for no less than three fics. That
way we'd discourage A) People who come in, read their best friends fic and
vote for it, and leave B) Ryoko Loves Fanboys who refuse to acknowledge the
fact that there are other good fics out there. Sure, Ryoko's Love is good
(I personally have some problems with the Alpha chapters, but I admit that
there is quality to the fic) but c'mon! You have si votes, and by only voting
for Ryoko's Love you are basically saying that no other fic is good. Now
for the fics Destiny's Balance is, IMHO, the best example of SI, I have ever
seen, and the only good SI gets a character ever. I think I know the reason
why too. Dav (and Cav and the rest) were not introduced as super characters,
but regular guys at a Mihoshi power evel (i.e. just guns) (except Ssedrey,
he's a bit more powerful). As for the getting Ayeka, there's a very simple
reason. Dav was NOT created to take Ayeka, he only got Ayeka because she
was made available by TF. So he is not defined by this fact, and e is a good
character. TO Love and To Hate. An excellent fic. Really dives into the
cahracters and gets a statement across. A) Tenchi really doesn't know what
he's doing, and might not even really know how the girls feel (sure, it's
easy for us to know, but he doesn't have a l the information). B) Any choice
is going to be filled with pain, and there is no "right" choice. It's a bit
(a bit???) dark, but I think it's going to lighten up soon (to a degree).
Heaven and Night makes another good statement. Tenchi is not going to chose
in a blink of an eye. Like any normal person, it is going to take time and
serious thought and catalyst, in order for him to make a decision. I know
some things about where the fic is going from the author, (which I won't
divulge) but if he didn't tell me, I'd be completely guessing. Confess to
You. What can I say? A magnificent, and beautiful fic. The love is brought
about beautifully, in a manner that many people have tried to copy, some
horribly butchering it too. Most importantly, Ayeka is neither forgotten
nor ignored. In fa t, Ayeka seems to be the most important character of the
fic, helping Ryoko and Tenchi prepare for the fight ahead. She even saves
Tokimi. Isn't that sweet of her. I absolutely love the reoccuring symbolism
of the butterfly. I can't wait for chapter 6 Daughters of Twilight. Again,
a beautiful and magnificent fic. It is more than just a "moment of weakness"
(one of the two most popular ways of Tenchi chosing), Ayeka and Tenchi are
brought to the threshhold of death. And once it's over, Tenchi is not damant
about what he said, he has to mull it over and determine if he really meant
it or if it was the intensity of the moment. Ryoko is handled well too. Dav
manages to bring out Ryoko's hurt without alienating the reader from Ayeka
and Tenchi. Finally, Two Guys, Two Girls, a Roshtarian Princess, and a Magical
Girl MST "The Switch" What can I say? This is simply the best MST that Cav
and Dav have done to date. I can't wait to see their next one (and I know
which fic it is, and it deserves to ie.)<br/>

hehe Someone pointed out that some people are voting for their friends....I
being one of them. I admit to that readily but tell you that it has nothing
to do with them being my friends. I voted for these people's fics because
they have the depth, emotion and i peccable writing skill that I most enjoy.
I that isn't what we are voting for then I am very sorry and I will gladly
have my vote stricken from the tally. I would also like to point out that
I DO read all of the fics that are submitted to the archive (and some that
aren't I might add) and I enjoy many of them to various degrees. I also try
to vote for the newest fics from each session instead of continually voting
for the same fic that hasn't been worked on in years (though I know that
life unfortunately D ES get in the way at times for the authors) Many of
the new fics are quite good, and if I had more spaces, I would have voted
for more of them but I couldn't so I chose the ones that struck a chord in
my heart the most, stimulated my mind to work overtime or what-have-you!
I don't vote on personal feelings but on the authors ability to strike a
bond between reader and character, and their ability to portray the backgrounds
and backstory and all the smaller interwoven strands that create a tapesty
that we c ll a story... Just wanted to clear that up since my name was
mentioned!<br/>

heh Someone pointed out the fact that a lot of people are voting for their
friends...That is true, I am one of them, but that is not WHY i voted! I
vote strickly for the quality, depth and emotion of the peice, not on my
own personal emotions! If the peices hat I voted for hadn't been so well
written, friends or not, i would NOT have voted for them. Next thing, I read
ALL of the fics posted whether I agree, disagree or can't make heads or tales
of it. I agree, there are some really great fics out there. Unfo tunatley,
I couldn't list them all when I voted, so I did what i always do, I chose
the ones that left a most memorable feel in my mind (and often my heart as
well!) I'm not saying that I wasn't touched by many others as well, but these
touched me the mos . I can't speak for everyone else, but I do know that
when I vote I vote fair and leave personal emotions-actually I should say
ATTACHMENTS- behind.... just wanted to clear that up since my name was
mention...hehe Truly-truly Meg * =-_-=*<br/>

Okay, well, I'm just gonna say something. Number One, I notice that a lot
of people are voting for their friends. Like Cav, Dav, Ssedrey, Meg, etc
etc... Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that a lot of
the times people refuse to read new things that are really well written but
are collecting dust. Just check out Where No Fic Goes Unpunished, there's
a ton of fics with great reviews that I notice are pretty new and aren't
really being voted for. Hands of Fate is one of those. I checked it out on
K'th's review page, 5 S's and a SAMI award. Yet everyone votes for To Love
and To Hate or Heaven and Night. While I do agree that these are marvelous
fics in their own right, I believe that other ones deserve recognition too.
Second, (yes, there's a second) I voted for these fics because they are newer
and are really well written by people that do deserve the credit. I really
enjoyed Hands of Fate and know that it's just going to get better. It is
an original goddess fic that explores the emotions of each of the characters
with such grace and beautiful poetry. To Love and To Hate is a nice fic,
it makes you wonder who Tenchi is actually going to end up with! Heaven and
Night is good fic that explores the relationship between Washu and Ryoko.
Though that whole bet sequence was a little confusing. Daughter's of Twilight,
well, I'm not really an Ayeka fan, but I do love the way Ryoko expresses
her pain and emotions here. Destiny's Balance, well, you probably already
know how great this fic is. These are my votes.<br/>

<b>Comments:</b><br/>
These are really some great fics. First off, Daughters of Twilight. I'm just
glad to see an Aeka fic of such astounding quality. This fic is absolutely
beautiful. Confess to You is one of my original favorites, so wonderfully
written, now if only she'd update more often ^_- Red Waters is a great,
introspective work, dealing very realistically with a dark event sweeping
over the house. Heaven and Night is a very good piece of Ryoko-ite propaganda
(j/k) I really like the fic, as Cav goes to great length to portray the reactions
of the cast with astounding realism. This isn't just some 'Tenchi suddenly
realizes how much he loves her' fi , I'm not even sure if he's going to end
up with her! Destiny's Balance (I'll admit, I haven't read much) but its
a very good fic, and what I've read deserves a big fat vote. Not to mention,
I'm sure Dav will be able to keep this level of quality. Finally, Dark Juraian.
This is a rather well written Aeka gets Tenchi fic, probably the first really
good one out there (DoT being the only other one). The quality dropped a
bit in later chapters, but the first two were absolutely great, and all-in-all,
it's a good fic. Well, that's all, I considered plugging my fic, To Love
and To Hate, but I don't think I'll do that ^___^<br/>

I thought that this fan fic was really thought out and the characters were
really well developed. It didn't have, what I call, an "Idiot Plot" where
any idiot could figure out what would happen next. Twists left and right,
and it kept me glued. Four ( ou heard me, FOUR) thumbs up!<br/>

I like voting for new fics, and these are ones that I think are worth the
read if you haven't read them: Tenchi Muyo! Revelations is in my opinion
a great read. Kevin really knows how to take you into the world of his storys,
and he really knows what to do with it. Keep it kickin Kevin, your top-notch!
Next up, To the Order of Chaos wasn't bad at all- the au hor did a smart
job telling you things to come, then taking you back to how it happened.
Lastly, Mayuka Get's It was very crude but good for a playful laugh, I give
the author that. He did a good job in showing the obsenity of a lemon- especially
for Mayu a. It was fun to read, so I vote on that. PERSONAL NOTE: MY LATEST
FAN FICTION- HERO OF MY HEART, CHAPTER TWO and TENCHI MUYO: SO ANXIOUS- THE
URGE ARE NEAR COMPLETION. WATCH OUT FOR THEM!<br/>

<b>Comments:</b><br/>
As you can see, I wanted to vote for fics that people have seemed to overlook
and not give a try. "Confess To You" didn't capture me and wasn't written
like everyone claimed it was, so I've selected these. "Hero of my Heart"
was nicely written and was tru to what was going on in Tenchi's head without
the author using IS. To me, Gannon knew what he was doing and he made it
stay close to reality on what was going on in the Masaki household, also
creating the romantic afect without showing in signs of Tenchi falling in
love. Also Gannon's lemon, "Tenchi Muyo: So anxious was very humorus and
had that aspect that Tenchi had feared since the time everyone moved into
his house- that he would start liking them! His recent reviseof the fic,
REAL EDITION really adde on that bridgework the fic needed and explained
the power Tenchi's terapist had. It was like Star Wars: Special Edition!
Keep up the good work Gannon and I await chapter two of "Hero of my Heart!
Next up, Eternal Heavens was a good explanitory fic dispite the fact that
it was a lemon. He did a good job, keep it up.<br/>

It's that time again!! I really like Hands of Fate, it's an interesting series
and I hope it continues. It's deep meaningful poetry and flowing language
really sets the story. Don't believe me? Check out K'thardin's review page
and see for yourself. Destiny's Balance is a great fic with original characters
full of meaning and depth. It's great. Confess to You, well, you all know
this fic. A great one, beautiful, powerful words the set the genre apart.
No Need for Sasami is great fic. Sasami's relationship to Tsunami is not
often displayed with so much depth and humanity. Vacation Days is a great
Mihoshi fic. I wish it didn't have to end. Well, last but not least, Ryoko's
Love. The fic that gave us Yui Masaki, one of the most original characters
ever to hit the fanfiction world. I love all these fics and hope they continue.
And most of all, here's to the writers, keep it go<br/>

<b>Favorite Tenchi FF #1:</b> Destiny's Balance<br/>
<p>
<b>Comments:</b><br/>
Ok guys and gals, I have descided that I will vote on Destiny's Balance by
an excellent author named Davner. First of all his story flows very well.
I love this fic because it has a great plot. For those people who didn't
read it yet...read it now and ote for this fic! If read this fic then vote
for it! If you didn't vote for this fic you better have a good reason why!
I don't really want to see Ryoko's Love to be top again, because its old.
I want to see something else with the same quality as Ryok 's Love and that
happens to be Destiny's Balance.<br/>

These are by far my favorites. I know most of these are older fics but I
love 'em to death. Just for the sake of everyone's feelings I don't really
consider these to be in any particular order. But if anyone reads this little
comments section to find o t suggestions of what to read I really recomment
anything by Thomas "009" Doscher. He doesn't waste words with his FF and
brings across a lot of really great stories taking different directions to
the same group of characters. If you have the time defin tely read some.
See ya!<br/>

"Ok these are in no particular order." Strikes looks over his shoulder and
sighs in relief. "First off Magical Girl Achika by J-Pikachu this is a hilarious
fic that i almost died from laughing to hard while reading it. Next up is
To Love and To Hate tT n does a great job of torturing characters and I have
to respect him for it! Next up is Cav's "I can write too!" fic and god damn
he can with a good engrossing plot dealing with Ryoko and Washu relationship
in the OAVs something that has never been reall done well. Last up are the
"Dav is a great writter..." Looks over shoulder again. "He should marry aeka...Oh
Hi dav... no I'm not doing anything you can put down the..."<br/>

Well here are my votes for this season. The authors of these fics did a wonderful
job... well except that Dav character. I only voted for him because he payed
me... Anyways I will now read off a few of the comments Mr. Doscher prepared
for me to tell you bout his fics. "Destiny's Balance is the pinacle of Tenchi
TV fan fics. It's exceptional writing style mixed with great plot create
a tale for all ages. Especially wonderful about this fic is the Davner/Aeka
romance. Please remember to tell AIC that you s pport adding Davner to OVA
3 to marry Aeka." Ahem... *sorts through cards* "Legend of the Overfiend
is a..." Wrong card... Ah here it is. "Daughters of Twilight is one of the
few, if not the only, Aeka and Tenchi romance fic that matters. All others
are i ferior in comparison, due to the wonderful portrayel of Ryoko and the
cheap plot device known as that kid that I forgot the name of." Anyways,
now for some free thoughts of my own on the other fics here. TM! Legend is
one of the few next gen fics that is orth reading. It is extremely well written
and Yosho hasn't scored with all the girls yet, placing him several levels
above other author created characters. MG Adorable Achika is a wonderful
fic based on Pretty Sammy, and will have you splitting your side from the
non-stop humor and no I did not steal that line off of the back of a DVD
box... really... TL&amp;TH is extremely evil, however very entertaining at
the same time... sort of like Bill Clinton's presidency.I can't believe I'm
actually voting for a fic by the author of "La Blue Sammy." Well, before
I sober up and realize what I'm doing, I'll hit the submit button. Hats off
to all the authors.<br/>

I don't think I really need to say why these fics are great. They pretty
much speak for themselves. I love Confess to You, I know a lot of you do
as well. Lita is a great writer and a pretty damn good artist too. ^_- Davner,
those fics were great!! Humorous, witty, powerful, and very sweet, I loved
all of them. I would have put more of your fics here but that wouldn't exactly
be fair. ^^ I like Ever After because of Sasami's POV, I like the writing
style and Sasami's new friends are interesting. Heaven and Night is a great
fic, I like it's depth and clarity. Hope that made sense. Well, I'll see
you all next season, vote for<br/>

I love Hands of Fate, I think it's a really good fic and hope it will continue.
I can see the writer is trying to show Ayeka's pain andemotions and still
gives attention to all the characters. Every one of these fanfics has created
a world of their own, a universe you travel to with each new story. I'm happy
to see people voting for some of the newer writers to enter the fanfiction
world. Keep up the go<br/>

I have to give credit to Vacation Days. The author actually got a complete

the author keeps at it. Heart and Soul is a really stand out to me. I like
how he was able to tell brand new Tenchi perspective. All the authors here
and the rest are really great and have shown a lot of imagination. I look
forward to keep on reading more.<br/>

<p>
<b>Comments:</b><br/>
It's that time of the season again, and here are my votes. The theme this
season is originality. First up is Cav's "Heaven and Night." It's a third
OAV fic that places the emphasis on Washu and Ryoko rather than Tenchi and
Ryoko. "I'll Go With You," b Ammadeau is still one of my favorites. It's
a Mihoshi/Tenchi fic that I truly enjoyed reading. "Ever After," by STRIKESTWICE,
is a post OAV 3 story that revolves around Sasami as a teenager. Next is
Dave Menard's "Tenchi Mucho!" Washu's from every Te chi continuity gather
in one place. I can't wait to see where it ends up. "Tenchi Muyo! Legend,"
by Ssedrey is a 2nd generation fic. The characters are interesting and
believable, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of them. "Father of the
Prince, by Darwin Cruz is unique in one key way. It's a Ranma/Tenchi crossover
that I *like*. Not only that, it's an Achika fic, and good fics that deal
with Achika are hard to come by. I enjoyed the prequel, "The Girl Who Wasn't
and the Princess Who Was," an I'm glad to see that Mr. Cruz decided to continue
it with this sequel.<br/>

Please vote for newer fics, folks! We should try to encourage new authors
and give them a chance. Anyway, I voted for the above fics because they were
great stories with original ideas, good writing quality, and they didn't
have character bashing.<br/>

"Love and Life" is a fresh sweet story that deserves recognition. When it
comes down to it this story is the soul of Tenchi Muyo. LOVE. That's what
it's all about. I read the author's note in the voting archives. To all of
you who e-mailed him with hostil ty over Tenchi marrying all six girls I
would simply like to say that you should be ashamed. He wrote a story ( a
damned good one for only being his second attempt) that came from the heart.
It should not have mattered whether or not you agreed with his v ews. To
Garry I would simply like to say don't let those few narrow minded people
get you down. Don't give up your stories, cousin. *I* at least liked them.<br/>

I don't know if this will be posted or not, but I would simply like to address
one small issue. It appears that some of you are rather upset with my fan
fics "Mind, Body, Hearts,and Souls" and "Love &amp; Life". I would like to
say to those individuals who d n't like them to just don't read them. These
stories were written more for me than you. It was something that *I* wanted
to see happen with Tenchi and his loves. These are *fictional* stories. Some
of you fail to realize that. I did not mean to upset anyo es image of Tenchi.
If it helps to ease anyones mind out there than I will be Man enough to say
"I'm sorry", although I don't know what I should be sorry for. I thought
that they were sweet stories. I enjoyed writing them *and* reading them,
but it appear that my work was futile. I did get three positive responses
and I'm most grateful for them. Those of you who didn't like them needn't
worry.........I will not write any more. Good bye. Garry Robinson

<b>Comments:</b><br/>
Well, I suppose I'm a little early, but given that I'm pretty confident that
it'll take a miracle to change my mind (and I was just plain bored), I decided
I'd go right ahead and cast my votes. I'd also like to bow down before these
mighty authors. Cav s great at coming up with stories and has what I believe
to be the best actual writing style that I've encountered out of all the
fanfiction I read. Dav and his "Destiny's Balance" really keep the reader
going. I have yet to be able to keep from getting absorbed in any of Dav's
fics and actually take time to really look at it critically. As for "Ryoko's
Love", I know it's one of the older stories, but I just can't help but vote
for it. A great plot and an excellent use of words. And being the fanfic
t at got me hooked in here to start with, well I feel it's necessary to pay
hommage to it. To all you readers, I highly recommend these three. If you
read nothing else in the archive, read these. I'll be seeing you ^_^<br/>

"Love and Life" has got to be one of the greatest Fan Fics to come along
that keeps all the characters together in love and happiness. The author
is right when he states that the strength of this show lies in the fact that
the characters love one another eeply and that they belong together. If you
love Tenchi then read this story. It may only be this author's second story,
but it will definitely strike a chord in your heart. That's why I'm voting
for this fic first. Keep it up Garry7 your doing great. <garrett jax=""><br/>

Okay, Okay, I know I'm early. Usually I vote around mid-season but I have
my picks now. Hands of Fate-I really really like this fic. I just wish Ryoke
would get on with Divine Offering. I can't wait to see that one. Hands of
Fate is very poetic and w tty and is original even for a goddess fic. Destiny's
Balance is a marvelous fic. It's funny, daring, witty, charming. I love the
idea of all the alien races and I just adore the character Davner. Sigh...^_^
Daughter's of Twilight is such a sweet Aek gets Tenchi fic. I had a copy
of The Simillarion for a long time but I never read it until I finished
Daughter's of Twilight, then it just seemed even better. Empire is GREAAAAT
fic!!! I love it so much. The Sum of All Memories, I really like the ide
that a man is nothing more than the some of his memories. It's really sweet
don'tcha know ^_^. And as for My Best Friend's Engagement, I thought that
the relationship between Tenchi and Aeka could have been developed al little
more and the fic itself c uld have been much more than what it was but it
was still very good none the less. Thomas Doscher man, I love you for these
fics!!! I hope you continue please !!!!!!!!<br/>

I like Fan Fics that deal with deep emotion. This particular story does just
that. Although I am an advocate that believes that Tenchi should remain together
with all his loves.......after all that's where their strength lies...in
being together. This particular story was written well and filled with emotion.
You should be proud of this one GenSao, it's taylor made and fits like a
glove for that little challenge you put out a while back.<br/>

Aikan Muyo is a beautifully done lemon -- I just glanced in and this one
stood out above the others. Kanashii no Imi deserves the vote because it
acurately depicts a Sasami lemon. It is the only one out there (apart from
Fukanzen) that really does it righ . I don't support the content, but it
needs a vote.<br/>

These are all great fics but aikan muyo is well written and deals with all
of the characters. I hope that the author decides to come out with a few
mor of the chapters that he has listed. I am a Ryoko fan and totally love
Ryokos Love, but there needs to b more to the story for the transition. The
same goes for LLL. The story goes along with what I believe could happen
in the OAV universe. I wish that this story would continue by someone.<br/>
