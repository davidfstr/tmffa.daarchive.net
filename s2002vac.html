<p>
On June 14, 2002, I finally graduated from the
<a href="_/http/www.ucdavis.edu" target="_top">University of California,
Davis</a> with a Bachelor of Science in
<a href="_/http/cee.engr.ucdavis.edu/index.html" target="_top">Civil Engineering</a>.
Many friends and family turned up for the occasion, and I appreciate their
support. I am proud of this accomplishment. I look forward to the long deserved
vacation. This will be my first time overseas since I was a child.

Spring Tour took us to several beautiful places. Some of these places
were the Forbidden City, Shanghai, the Great Wall of China, a hot spring,
and many other places.  I have to thank my friend Lenny for aranging
the trip.
