<big><big>Introduction</big></big>
<p>
There has been a greater and greater demand for a quality filter and more
stringent standards to the submission of entries to the TMFFA.  Recently
there has been also a degradation in the quality of stories submitted to
the TMFFA.  The demographics of the fan base has changed to a more younger
and immature audience. In attempt to increase the quality of fics, a "quality
filter" has activate as of 2/20/2001.
<p>
What the quality filter will do is, basically entries will be screened for
some minimum standard. Fics lacking the proper submission information
will not be posted until corrected.  Stories that are too short (with
the exception of spamfics) and lack of any form of basic proof reading
(very poor grammar) will also be "sent back for revision."
<p>
The content of the stories will not be censored or screened.  Once passing
the "quality filter" your fic will be added accordingly.  This
quality filter is intended to raise the standards of stories that have been
sent to the archive. With about 75% of the public supporting this move, the
filter has been activate.
<p>
<big><big>Requirements</big></big>
<p>
Basically, if your story does not follow any of the described requirements,
it may not be posted.  After correcting and fixing these errors, I will
post your story if it passes this filter/requirement.
<p>
<big>Grammar</big>
<p>
Most fics will now be placed on "hold" under this requirement. Spelling,
sentence structure, syntax will be looked at.  A few errors are acceptable,
but when it seems as if the story was not even proofread, your story won't
be posted until you revise it. Basically I am looking for "high school" level
grammar.  Best way to solve this problem is to have someone proof read
your story.
<p>
<big>Format</big>
<p>
If it is hard to read, or to follow the sentence structure, your fic may
be sent back as well. This is where I can not see where paragraphs end.
Dialog is confusing due to poor formatting and run-ons. There are irregular
characters that make it hard to read (Usually from Non TXT files or poor
conversions).  The file should also follow a 72 character width restriction.
 Best way to solve this problem is so save your file as a Simple MS-DOS
TXT File.
<p>
<big>Submission Information</big>
<p>
I am being more strict with the <a href="add.html">submission guidelines</a>.
Your fic may be sent back if not all the required info is included. If I
have a problem in understanding how your story is organised, it will be returned.
Please do your best to be clear and concise or your fic will fail the filter.
<p>
<big>Length</big>
<p>
Stories of shorter length will be of greater scrutiny. "College/University"
level grammar is required of smaller fics. If it is less than 10 KB, it may
sent back for you add more to it. The only exception is spam/short fics.
 Ideally if it is a multipart fic, you should try to write more (or
finishing the tale) before calling it a chapter.
<p>
<big><big>Resubmission</big></big>
<p>
If your story "fails" the filter requirement, don't lose hope.  Just
take the time to fix the problems and resubmit. I will not edit of fix the
stories for you. It is your responsibility to fix and resubmit the story.
