ANNOUNCER(YOSHO): New Year's Eve, Eighteen-hundred Eighty-seven.
TENCHI: Trouble down at mill!
AEKA: On, no! What kind of trouble?
TENCHI: I don't know! Mr. Makibi told me to come and say "Trouble
down at mill" that's all. I wasn't expecting a kind of Jurian
Inquisition-(sound of a axe lopping of someone's head)
RYOKO: NOBODY EXPECTS THE JURIAN INQUISITION! Our chief weapon is
suprise! Suprise and fear!
Fear and supri-Ah! Our two weapons are Fear, suprise and ruthless
efficiency-Ah! Our three weapons are Fear, suprise, ruthless
efficiency and an almost fanatical devotion to the Emperor-Ah!
Amongst our weapons are such elements as fear, suprise...Come in
again.
TENCHI: I didn't expect a kind of Jurian Inquisition!(axe sfx again)
RYOKO: NOBODY EXPECTS THE JURIAN INQUISITION! Amongst our weapon are
such diverse elements as fear, suprise, ruthless effeciency, an
almost fanatical devotion to the Emperor and a fleet of tree-aarrgg!!
Cardinal Mihoshi, you'll have to do it. come in again.
TENCHI:(monotone voice) I didn't expect a kind of Jurian Inquisition
(axe sfx AGAIN)
MIHOSHI: Uhh..Nobody..uhh....
RYOKO: Expects..
MIHOSHI: Ahem! Nobody expects the Jurian Inquisition! In fact those
who do expect-
RYOKO: Our chief weapons....
MIHOSHI: Our chief weapons are...uhh..suprise and uhh...fear!
RYOKO: STOP THAT! STOP! Our chief weapons are suprise, blah,blah,blah!
Cardinal Washu, read the charges!
WASHU: That's 5000 yen for a full sketch, 700 for a quickie. What'll
you have?
AEKA: Sketch, please!
SCENE: A conference room with Tsunami, Kiyone and Nagi.
TSUNAMI: Next up is the design for the residential block we'll be
putting up and I though it be best for the architects themselves to
show us their designs. That's probably the fist arichitect now.
(Noboyuki enters) Mr. Masaki of Masaki and Morisato.
NOBOYUKI: Good morning. This is a model of a twelve storie block
combining classical Neo-Geogian
features with the efficientcy of modern techniques. The tenents
arrive here at the entrance, are carried along the corridor on a
convaier belt in extreme comfort past murals depecting Jurian scenes
towards the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor
are heavily sound-proffed. The blood pours down these shoots and the
mangled flesh pours down into these large-
KIYONE: Excuse me, did you say knives?
NOBOYUKI: Rotating knives, yes.
TSUNAMI: Are you proposing to slaughter our tenents?
NOBOYUKI: Does that not fit in with your plans?
KIYONE: No, it does not. We asked for a simple block of flats.
NOBOYUKI: Ahhh. I had not fully divined you attitude towards the
tennents. You see, I mainly design slaughterhouses. Pity. Mind you,
this is a real beaut. None of your blood caked to the walls and flesh
flying out the windows inconverting the passers-by. My life has been
building up to this.
TSUNAMI: And well done, but we wanted a block of flats.
NOBOYUKI: Well, might I ask you to reconsider. You wouldn't regret
this. Think of the tourist trade.
KIYONE: I'm sorry, but we wanted a block of flats and not an abituaur.
NOBOYUKI: Ah, yes. Well that's the kind of blinkard, Jurian,
pig-ignorance I've come to expect from you non-creative garbage!
You sit there on your cute little behinds not giving a damn about the
struggling artist, you excrement! You whinning, hipocritical toadies
with you Pioneer LDC's and TV sets and your bleeding Masonic
handshakes! YOU WOULDN'T LET ME JOIN, YOU BLACKBALLING BITCHES! WHY
I WOULDN'T BECOME A FREEMASON NOW IF YOU GOT ON YOUR LOUSY, STINKING
KNEES AND BEGGED ME!
TSUNAMI: Sorry you feel that way, but we did want a block of flats!
NAGI: Nice, though, the abituaur is!
NOBOYUKI: Oh, shove the abituaur, it's not important. But if you
could put in a good word for me I'd love to become a Mason! Masonry
opens so many doors! I'd be real quiet. I was bit on edge just now.
If I were a Mason I'd sit at the back and not get in anyone's way.
KIYONE: Thank you.
NOBOYUKI: I've got a second hand apron.
TSUNAMI: Thank you!
NOBOYUKI: I nearly got in at Amano.
NAGI: Thank you! Have we anyone else to see?
KIYONE: There's the Jurian Inquisition.
TSUNAMI: I didn't expect the Jurian Inquisition!(you know the sound by now)
RYOKO: NOBODY EXPECTS THE JURIAN INQUISITION! Our chief weapon is suprise.
That's all. Just suprise.
MIHOSHI: What about fear?
RYOKO: Alright, suprise and fear.
WASHU: And an almost fana-
RYOKO: SHUDDUP! You're acused of heracy on three counts: Heracy by though,
heracy by word, heracy by deed and heracy by action-uh, four, four counts.
Now you have one last chance. Confess the heinous sin heracy. Reject the
works of the-two last chances-and you shall be free-three last chances!
You have three last chances! Unrighteous creatures, how do you plead? Heh
heh heh! (pauses and looks around)Where did everybody go? Cardinal Washu?
CARDINAL WASHU!
WASHU: I was just having some tea and Spam with these....
EVERYBODY: Spam spam spam spam! Spam spam spam spam! SPAMIDY-SPAM!!!-
SASAMI:(dressed as Pretty Sammy) STOP THAT! STOP THAT! It's silly!
(everybody looks at her and begins to snicker) What's so funny?
