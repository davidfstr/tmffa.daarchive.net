[The scene - a well furnished apartment, with two couches in an L formation
in front of a large cabinet that includes a wide-screen TV and video
recorder. The apartment has a few doors to who-knows-where, and a small
kitchenette.]

[Two new piece of furniture have been added - a coffee table in front of the
two couches, and a desk off to the side. It provides a home for a rather
nondescript PC with all the usual add-ons. Tsuneo is sitting at the desk,
working on the PC.]

[Rick and Dan enter, arguing.]

Dan: Just what were you doing spending all that time on the computer anyway?
Rick: Well, I figured out a way to edit the missions in 'Fighter's
	Anthology*' to give ground objects names.
Dan: So?
Rick: I went on a cross country rampage in a Tu-95 bomber and sunk USS
	Oscar, USS Dr. Thinker, USS Gonterman, USS Koopa, USS Silver Starr-
Dan: Hey! You shoulda left that one for me!
Rick: You can play the mission anytime.
Dan: Cool. [Walks over to the desk and adresses Tsuneo.] Shove off, I've got
	some alleged authours to annhialate.
Tsuneo: Not yet. We've got fan mail.
Rick: You've got to be joking.
Tsuneo: No, serious! One mail, and two people commenting on 'Tina's World.'
Dan: Well, bring 'em up!

> Hahahahaah!!!
>
> Whoa, that was funny.  I liked your format set and and really wish I had
> been more clear about the origin of my characters when I had started
> mine.  Loved your riffs, especially the Red Dwarf line!  (I've got to
> remember to use Holly some time.)  Can't wait to see more of your stuff.

Tsuneo: And that's from some clown called Mike Surbrook.
Dan: Whoah! He's a veteran MSTer, and he liked our comments, we must be
	doing something right. Thanks, Mike!
Rick: I feel so honoured. Who are the other two?
Tsuneo: First one's from Naia Zifu-
Rick: That name rings a bell.
Dan: Tolls it, more likely.
Tsuneo: She says: "Wow! That was fun! That was really silly. Do PTSN next!"
Rick: PTSN?
Dan: I have a horrible sense of foreboding.
Tsuneo: The other's from some guy calling himself "Ghost" or "Ghosty" or
	something like that. He says: "That was sick. I loved it! Do more."
Rick: Cool.
Dan: Don't either of you give him ideas, okay?
Voice: Who, me?
Dan: Damn.
Tsuneo: Oh, hi there.
Voice: Hey guys. Good to see you're all here.
Rick: Ahem. Isn't there someone missing?
Voice: Don't worry, I've sent a replacement. She should be here soon.
Dan: I hope this babe's nicer.

[A woman walks in through the doorway. She is tall and slim, with a _very_
nice figure. She has dark blue eyes and waist-length black hair tied into a
high ponytail. She is wearing a baggy khaki flightsuit and a jacket.]

Natasha: Hi there guys. I'm Rebecca's substitute... She had to go for a hair
	appointment or something.
Dan: Oh, god, no! [Falls over backwards.]
Natasha: Oh, it's him.
Voice: Tell us a bit about yourself, please.
Natasha: Ok... My name's Natasha Isavia. I'm from several years after a
	campaign set 22 years in his [points at Rick] future, but I had an accident
	with a time machine prototype and a toaster, and ended up on the same Rifts
	Earth as Dan.
Rick: WOW! I'm gonna meet a babe like you?!?!?!
Dan: [From floor] Ouch.
Natasha: Not quite. Allthough I did go out with your son for a while.
Dan: [Leaps up] Nononono! BAD idea. Don't tell him too much about his future
	 - you never know what could happen.
Natasha: Okay, fair enough. Although Rick, if you ever meet a scientist
	named Dr. Howards, do NOT do anything nasty to him at all, especially if it
	involves your Colt .45.
Rick: Rrrriiiggghhhttt.
Voice: Don't try it, Natasha.
Natasha: What in blazes was that?
Dan: That's our boss.
Natasha: Thank god, I thought it was the voices in my head again. [Rick and
	Tsuneo stare at her.] What?
Dan: You too, huh?
Voice: If I may? I've explained the basics of the job already to Natasha.
Tsuneo: You didn't sign anything, did you?
Natasha: Er... yes, why?
Rick: Too late. Never mind.
Natahsa: Ah. Oh, dear.
Voice: All we need you to do is stand in for Rebecca and supply commentary
	on an anime fanfiction I'll be showing you.
Natasha: Annie who?
Dan: You know, those Japanese 'toons with all the sex and blood and giant
	robots and lesbo schoolgirls in sailor suits and crap.
Natasha: Sounds familiar... except for the schoolgirls bit.
Rick: And all the characters, especially the babes are drawn with these
	honkin' big googly eyes.
Natasha: Fine. When can I go home?
Voice: Not until the fanfic's been fully reviewed.
Tsuneo: You'll get used to it eventually.

[They sit on the couches - Tsuneo next to Natasha on the forward facing
couch, Rick closest to Natasha on the couch on her right and Dan next to
him, closest to the TV.]
Tsuneo: Oh, and Rick, can we please avoid this whole Ayanami/Mercury thing
	unless the subject matter comes up again?
Rick: [Mutters] Not fair...
Natasha: Anything I should know about?
Rick: Oh, nothing. Just trying to decide which blue-haired socially inept
	neurotic Japanese 14 year-old schoolgirl is better.
Natasha: Ah. Oh, and Dan? I should just remind you of my telekinetic
	abilities, so should you lay a finger on me, I'll rip your arm out of its
	socket.
Dan: Ulp!
Rick: You have a real way with women, don't you?

Dan: This is bad.
Rick: Very bad indeed.
Tsuneo: It couldn't get much worse.

Dan: [Looks pointedly at Natasha] The kind that DON'T involve a magnum.
Natahsa: [Innocently] What?

> A Tenchi Muyo! / Evangelion Lemon Crossover

[Dead silence]
Dan: Damn.
Natasha: What's a lemon?
Rick: A fanfic with LOTS of "Horizontal Action"
Natasha: Like Scuzzy & Mullet in most X-Files fics?
Rick: Yup.
Natasha: Or more like Kira & Dax or Janeway & Kes or 36 of D in most Trek
	fics?
Rick: Probably the latter.
Dan: Sweet. [Rick hits him with a cushion]

> Part One:  Moving Forward

All: [Singing] Moving right along, diddy-dum, diddy-dum...

> Disclaimer:  This part contains no actual lemon scenes

Dan: Ah, what?
Tsuneo: Thank god for that.
Rick: So it's a lemon without the lemons. Right.

>	"Washuu-chan!"

Natasha: Gesundheit.
Dan: AACK! No!
Tsuneo: What?
Dan: I can't believe it! This fanboy is so bad, he's using Japanese
	suffixes!
Tsuneo: So?
Dan: At this rate, he'll probably be inserting 'arigato' and 'gomen nasai'
	and suchlike.
Tsuneo: So?
Dan: So? It's wrong! This is the English language, for crying out loud! You
	don't need it! There is no reason to mix the two languages!
Tsuneo: I fail to see what the probelm is.
Dan: Okay, let's put it this way. How would you feel if, say in your
	favourite anime, the characters inserted english words instead of saying
	the Japanese counterpart in the original script?
Tsuneo: They do anyway.
Dan: [Dead silence]

> Tenchi cried,

Natasha: Crybaby!

> stepping the meter that separated
> light years between Earth and Washuu's laboratory.

Dan: Um, there's no distance to step, it just sort of transports you there.
	And it's in a pocket dimension, not light years away.
Rick: Fanboy.

Dan: Despite the fact that he's seen them many times before.

> There was always something blinking or churning in

Natasha: And I get the idea this fic is coming from the self proclaimed
	greatest writer in the universe.
Tsuneo: No, from him and captain Katsuragi.
[Rick, Dan & Tsuneo shudder with fright.]
Natahsa: Who is this Katsuragi person, anyway?
Rick: You'll no doubt meet her soon.

>	Said genius stepped out on a hole in space

Tsuneo: Question. How can you have a hole in nothing?
Rick: Many of these fanfics have plot holes.
Tsuneo: Touche.

Dan: Which he didn't recognize, remember?
Tsuneo: Okay, okay.
Dan: And just about nothing surprises this guy anymore.
Tsuneo: Enough already!

>  "Washuu-chan."  He repeated to the red haired scientist. 
>	She stared at him a moment with her piercing green eyes.

Natasha: Which when straight through him and knocked him to the floor.
Tsuneo: You're getting the hang of this.

> Then, she turned to a device behind her.

Tsuneo: Unfortunately it wasn't a grammar checker to tell her about that
	rogue comma.

> She called out in a commanding voice
> that belied her physical appearance, which is that of a ten year old.

Natasha: So the greatest scientist in the universe looks like a ten year
	old.
Dan: Never mind, it'd take too long to explain.
Rick: Hey, this writer's probably ten years old. They'd get along famously.

> "Come here.  I have created something that may be of interest to you."

Rick: [Tenchi] This isn't another attempt to get that sample, is it?

Rick: [Washu] It's a mass of metal and wires, stupid!

>	"Don't you know anything?"

Rick: No.
Natasha: Neither does this authour.

Dan: What was soft?
Rick: Naughty! [Hits him with the cushion again]
Natasha: Naughty! [Throws cushion at him]

Rick: Obviously, this ten-year-old geek of an authour watches too much Star
	Trek as well.

>	"Layman's terms."  Tenchi replied, used to Washuu's way of speaking,
> but still unable to decipher its meaning.

Dan: [Washu] That is layman's terms. You don't want the technical version!

>	"Time Machine."  She explained simply.

Dan: I also forsee a sequence of events that precipitates violence.
Rick: And if it was a time machine, it would have a 'temporal' in the
	pseudo-scientific gobbletygook.
Dan: Who watches too much Star Trek?
Tsuneo: [Tenchi] Great! We can go back in time and stop anyone from writing
	this fanfic!
Natasha: Washu is Will Robinson with a sex change?

>	Why she didn't just say that in the first place was beyond Tenchi.

Rick: 'Cause she's a mad scientist. She doesn't have to say anything
	straight.
Natasha: Please tell me she doesn't have a beautiful daughter.
Others: Ahh...

> Washuu works in mysterious ways, much to the constant chagrin of the
> Masaki household.  "So, what exactly am I supposed to be interested in
> it for?"

Natasha: Oh, use your brain, kid!
Tsuneo: Go back in time and kill the authour!
Rick: We just said that!
Dan: Are all our fanfics going to be about bad time travel stuff?

>	This actually seemed to bring Washuu up a bit short.

Rick: That was terrible.

> "Um, actually, I'm not quite sure."

Dan: Now there's an out-of-character moment.

> She looked up at him with wide eyes.

Natasha: I see what you meant about the googly eyes.
Rick: Then pray you don't meet Sasami.
[Tsuneo falls to floor, gagging.]

> "I have no

Natasha: Yup! Grade A+ mad scientist material. Just build it for the heck of
	it!
Rick: Just out of morbid curiosity, who is this guy I'm not meant to do
	anything to?
Voice: Leave it out, Natasha.
Natasha: A mad scientist.
Rick: Rriigghhtt. Okkaayy.
[Tsuneo climbs back onto the couch.]

>	As Tenchi was trying to figure out what to say next,

Dan: Petty typical of the wuss.
Tsuneo: Who are you calling a wuss?
Rick: Please, not again...

Natasha: EEK!
Rick: Naughty time machine! Exposing yourself to a lady.
Tsuneo: What joke is overdone, pray tell?

Dan: Hey!
Tsuneo: Great idea!
[All cover their eyes.]

Rick: Man, this has made an improvement to the fanfic.
Voice: Sorry, guys, but you're meant to review it properly.
Natasha: Ahh, nuts.
[All uncover their eyes.]

>	Then, his eyes fell on two familiar kanji.

Dan: NO! 'Characters' would do perfectly fine, but noooo. You have to be a
	wanker, don't you?
Rick: Allright, calm down.

> What they were attached
> to made the familiar almost totally alien to him.  "Tokyo 3?"

Tsuneo: And there's the crossover, folks!
Natasha: We will now commence a sequence of events that includes violence.

> He said
> out loud in confusion.  He hadn't realized there was a second Tokyo.
> Needless to say, Tenchi became even more lost than he already was.

Dan: Umm... Just a passing thought... But why would there be a sign in the
	middle of the city saying what city this was?
Tsuneo: So a character in a bad crossover who just 'ported in would know
	where he was, obviously.
Rick: Considering this is EVA, he could be right there.

---------------------------------------

>	Washuu woke up, a splitting headache wracking her brain.

Natasha: [Washu] Ow. My head's split open.
Tsuneo: That was a bad one.
Natahsa: Does it deserve better?

> Fingers to her temples, she tried to massage away the pain.

Dan: No, she'd probably just pull an aspirin out of a dimensional pocket.

> Meeting with mixed success, she looked around herself.

Rick: I suppose that requires some sort of funky, out-of-the-head camera.
Natasha: Or just a large quantity of illegal drugs.
Dan: Does she do ANYTHING legal at all?
Tsuneo: [Washu] Yup! I'm me alright!

> She seemed to be in a bunker of

Rick: So she looks at the terrain and thinks she's in the Arctic, and looks
again and thinks she's in Antarctica. Right.

>  Across the frozen tundra

Dan: Um, which one of us wants to point out that tundra is NOT found in
	Antarctica?
Tsuneo: Never mind.

Tsuneo: Yes, that's where it's meant to be.
Rick: I think this authour needs to take a good lie down.
Natasha: Sideways.

Tsuneo: Like this fanfic.
Natasha: Houston, we have a problem.

All: Too easy.

Dan: Err... That's going to take quite a while, you know.

Rick: That's one damn wierd shockwave if it causes amnesia before it hits.

Dan: Hang on here. If this is the second impact, which it obviously is, then
	the shockwave wouldn't do that much damage since captain boozo survived. It
	was the shift in orbit and the melting of Antarctica that did all the
	damage.
Tsuneo: Never mind, it's just a fanfic.

> Washuu had no doubts of her immortality

Tsuneo: Is it time to mention something here about the definition of
	immortality and the sense in doubting it?
Others: No.

> at that moment.  Immortality?  Washuu's brow furrowed a bit as something
> lost to her many millennia ago made its way to the surface of her

Dan: Which had just been wiped, remember. And how does she have any concept
	of immortality left, then?
Rick: Tropic of Cancer, which she'd borrowed from the library and leant to
	George.

Tsuneo: Despite the fact that there was extensive work going on within
	eyesight and someone might have used it during that work?
Rick: Okay, it's got holes you can punt Jupiter through. Can we leave that

Dan: There's nothing between... oh, alright.
Rick: I forsee a lemon bit approaching.
Tsuneo: One of the worst examples of foreshadowing I've ever seen.

> She really didn't want to know what it was that had caught her.

Rick: Definitely lemon alarm.
Dan: Probably just Tenchi's dad... again.

Rick: [Ayeka] Yes, I'll have the cavernous room, and make sure its spiced
	with plenty of apprehension.

Natasha: Gods, what a wimp!
Dan: Does this mean she'll get caught in the crossfire when those two start
	frying each other again?
Rick: We can only hope.

> Ryo-ohki was perched on her head in the usual fashion.

Rick: Anyone for a game of golf? We'll use Ryo-ohki as the ball and Sasami's
	head as the tee.
Dan: Rick!

> Both of them stared in awe at the size of Washuu's main room.

Dan: Although they've seen it a hundred times as well.
Rick: [Hits him with the cushion again.] I thought we said to stop that!

Dan: Yeah, yeah, we all know what it looks like.
Natasha: What about the people who haven't seen the series?
Dan: Then why not describe the characters too?
Natasha: Good point.

Rick: [Sasami] I want that one!
Natasha: Rick! I'm shocked!
[Tsuneo climbs back onto the couch.]

> She thought this was all silliness.

Tsuneo: What, trying to find the man they love? Yup, silliness alright.
Natasha: No, she just thinks this fic is silly.
Tsuneo: That's my line! 

> Then, she recalled the time Washuu tried to...  she blushed a bit,

All: Eugh!
Rick: [Kryten] It doesn't bare thinking about!

> squelching that thought.

All: [Make squelching noises.]

> Well, perhaps it was best they found Tenchi.
> With that in mind, she skipped of after Ryouko and her sister.

Tsuneo: Real children don't go hoppity-skip unless they're on drugs.
Rick: If I catch you being twee again I will knot your arms behind your
head.
Natasha: Please.
Dan: Where have I heard that one before...

Rick: ...Chickens, dinosaurs, nerdy kids, amoebas, mad scientists...
Dan: Okay, okay!

Tsuneo: This coming from someone who teleports at will.

Tsuneo: Yes, I think we'd established that already.
Rick: This is targeted at the sort of people who read lemons. Obviously he

Rick: Damn, done that one.

Dan: See! See!

01?
All: Nah.

Tsuneo: Names would help sometime soon.
Rick: I think the authour assumes that you know what he's talking about.
Tsuneo: Hang on - If this is the one that thinks they're Misato Katsuragi,

Natasha: Has he ever considered joining the olympics team?
Tsuneo: Maybe school athletics first.

Dan: Ryoga. And you put the given name _first_ in the _English_ language.
Rick: Smile and nod.

Dan: No, that was... [Everyone throws cushions at him]

Dan: [Smugly] See!
Tsuneo: [Grumbles]
Rick: And any minute now, I bet the authour's going to say that Ritsuko was
one of the others.
Natasha: Eew!

Dan: This is the woman with the willpower of a squashed possum complaining

Tsuneo: [Misato] The writer, without thinking, made a cruddy crossover lemon.
Natasha: [Misato] The boss, without thinking, gave it to us.
Rick: Who is the greater fool?

> jumps into the car and slams the door. That's funny, I think, I didn't

Rick: Crossover activated.
Tsuneo: Maybe that's because the picture was taken from head-on.
Dan: And how can anyone possibly mistake Tenchi and weenie man anyway?
Tsuneo: You take that back!
Natasha: [Ignoring them] Ah... six pack for breakfast?
Rick: A distinct possibility.

>	"You had better hang on tight,

Rick: [Misato] Not to _that_ thank you!

> Shinji-kun... This one's gonna be bumpy!"

Dan: What's going to be bumpy?
Tsuneo: Huh?
Dan: This is a lemon, after all. [Everyone throws cushions at him]

> I say to him as I take off,

Dan: My shirt.
Rick: Up, up and away!
Tsuneo: [Buzz] To infinity and beyond!
Natasha: Liftoff! We have liftoff!

Rick: Safe... clif. Rrriiiggghhhttt.
Natasha: Oooh, it's so tempting...

> and I stop the car. We get out of the car,

Tsuneo: [Misato] My car! Oh, and the city's being trashed.
Rick: I hope whoever you paid to make that damage for you didn't charge too
	much.

Rick: The new Yahoo! search engine for all possible details on the UN.

Tsuneo: It was an N2 _mine_ you dolt!
Rick: With the destructive power of a hundred self-insertion crossover lemons!
Dan: Where the term 'self-insertion' takes on a whole new meaning. [Everyone
	throws cushions at him]
Natsha: Sick boy. Sick.

Tsuneo: [Little kid] Waah! I wanna go home now!
Rick: I sense a Lemon moment coming on.

Tsuneo: It was in the mountains at this stage, but nevermind.

Rick: Lemon moment.
Others: We know.

Natasha: No shit, Sherlock.
Tsuneo: Even compensating for the age problem, they still look nothing
	alike.

> He's looking

Dan: Big deal! Happens to him every other day.

>	"Ah... excuse me miss...", the boy says nervously.

Tsuneo: He speaks!
Dan: Usually he would have explained the whole thing by now... like when
	they were in the car...

>	"Eh? Nani?", I reply, wondering what he could possibly say at a time

Dan: [Misato] Your name is Shinji, isn't it?
Tsuneo: [Ditto] Do you come here often, or only during Angel attacks?

>	He looks up at me, and is about to speak. I looks

Natasha: I looks?
Dan: [Idiot voice] I has done a good thing I has.

Tsuneo: No, actually, there are these things called eye sockets, you see...

Rick: Now that was pointless.
Natasha: But probably expected.
Tsuneo: Why in blazes would she do that?
Dan: Yeah! When she's got Ritsuko to go back to.
Rick: [Looks around] She's lurking here somewhere, isn't she?
Natasha: What's up with you?
Rick: He sounded just like Rebecca then.
Dan: [Shudders]

All: Out of character.

Tsuneo: I feel nauseous. The prepostrousness of this whole situation.
Dan: Like anything gets Tenchi turned on by now.

> and think, "No.. this is not just some kid..."

Rick: Look at him! He's eighteen years old, you cretin!
Dan: And heir to the Juraian throne!
Tsuneo: And posessor of the greatest energy in the universe!
Natasha: [Stunned] That's some kid!

> We

Rick: Is that an N2 mine in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?

>	We get out of the ditch, and I look to the Tokyo 3 skyline. "Masaka!

Dan: Huh?
Tsuneo: What?
Rick: Uh?
Natasha: Am I missing something here?
Dan: Unit 01 did _not_ go out, especially _not_ with Rei piloting it!

> He looks at me like I'm crazy,

Natsha: Fifteen points for observation, that man.

> but it's expected: he knows nothing of Project Eva,

Natasha: Becuase it's the wrong kid.

Rick: Ye gods! She's almost as much of a whiner as that Serena.
Dan: Almost.
[Tsuneo falls to floor, gagging.]

>	"Ah!! My car! Come on, Ikari-kun, let's turn it over.

Rick: Yeah! Now there's an idea! [Everyone throws cushions at him]
Dan: Hasn't he noticed yet that this madwoman's calling him Shinji Ikari?

> We need to get

> surprisingly easy, and I'm delighted mto know that it still runs.

Tsuneo: [Getting up off floor] What about the batteries?
Dan: What about continuity?
Natasha: What about intelligence?
Rick: Never mind.

> I think,

Rick: What a surprise!
Dan: Aw, come on, that one was below you.

> "Dammit! And I still have 33 more payments to make... and look at this

>	"Um, miss? I uh, didn't catch your name." So, finally he speaks.

Dan: Actually he said something like that before... Thanks so much for
	paying attention.

>	I turn to him and say, "Ikari-kun, I'm Katsuragi Misato, didn't you

Natasha: Wouldn't this be a good time to explain, young man?
Dan: Naww... why would he want to break his brand new habit of being
	unhelpful and quiet?

> "Ah well, at least you got to me in one piece.

Dan: [Misato] I'll fix that, though.

> I was worried that you might have
> gotten hurt in the attack... are you okay?"

Tsuneo: [Deep breath] No, my house has been invaded by variuous alien
	princesses, space pirates, galactic police, mad scientists, and a cabbit,
	then I was transported here, nearly stepped on by [points] that thing,
	kidnapped by a madwoman who calls me Shinji Ikari and kisses me for no
	reason whatsoever and above all else I'm caught in a crappy crossover
	lemon fanfic! [Gasps for breath]
[Everyone else applauds]

> He nods to me, yes. I think,
> "What a strange guy, you think that he would talk a little more,

Dan: I won't say it... I have more willpower than that...

> but it's not every day that you see an Angel, though."

Rick: Depends on what you've been snorting.
Natasha: Or if you live on Babylon 5.

> I say, "Okay, Shinji-kun... we have to get to the geofront, hold on!"

>	"Wha... geofront?!!"

Rick: Geocities... Geofront?

--------------------------------------

>	Sachiel, the third Angel, is tromping around Tokyo-3, smashing what

Dan: -And generally having a good time.
Natasha: [Bored] Wow. Brilliant discriptive passage there.
Tsuneo: [Interviewer] So, do you think Sachiel is just misunderstood, or a
	wild guy out for a night on the town?
Rick: Geee, you know, I never thought of angels as having a gender. Someone
	should check.
Dan: Someone very tall.
Rick: Someone with protective headgear.

>	A small, furry animal is looking around nervously at her new

Natasha: And promptly got squished by Sachiel. The end.
Rick: [Bored] Yay.

Rick: No woman is ever alone with a carrot...
[Rick sudenly lifts out of his seat, is inverted in mid-air and is slammed
against ther floor a few times. He is finally left lying on the floor, dazed.]
Natasha: And don't you EVER say ANYTHING like that again.
Rick: [Moaning] I'm sorry, I don't know what came over me.

> Ryo-ohki meows happily, running for

All: YAY!

All: Aww...

> All of Ryo-ohki's fur stands on end, and she growls, very pissed off

Natasha: Oohh, I'm scared.

---------------------------------------

>	I think, "Oh boy.. I hope that Rei can handle the Angel enough

[Dan opens his mouth to say something]
Natahsa: Don't even think about it!
Rick: [Picks face up off floor] Yeah, just hit it with those bubbles, of yours
	and he'll get all confused. [Dan hits him on the head]

Tsuneo: Rick?
Rick: [Climbing onto couch] Yes?
Tsuneo: Don't.
Natasha: Try harder next time.
Tsuneo: Damn!

> I look to the boy next to me, and I smile

Dan: HE'S NOT... Oh, I give up.
Rick: [Wicked witch] I've got you my pretty, and your little dog too!

> He's still looking at me

Tsuneo: A description would be nice here.
Rick: That's asking way too much.

---------------------------------------

Rick: See?

Rick: And his trousers.
Dan: Rick! That's my line!
Rick: Sorry. It was so inviting.
Dan: Like Misato... [Gets hailed with cushions.]

Rick: Yeah, she flipped all the right switches.
Natasha: You're disgusting.

Tsuneo: No matter how many times it's happened to him before.

> It excited him, made him feel... naughty, for lack of a better term.

All: NAUGHTY?
Dan: Now I understand her problem with recognising him! This isn't Tenchi!

All: Boring.

Dan: Oh, this is just too easy.
Natasha: [Misato] Oh my! That _is_ an N2 mine in your pocket!
Dan: Natasha!
Natasha: [Challenging] What?
Dan: I'm impressed.

Tsuneo: So can you tell me in very clear and precise language what it is
	about Tokyo 3 that makes it look so futuristic?

> How far he had yet to figure out.

Rick: For once in a time travel story, there are no convenient calendars or
	helpful people to explain it to him.

Natasha: Is that the friend of "Drooling Anime Fan Barbie?"
Dan: No, it's his sword.
Rick: But close enough.
Natasha: So why can't the authour say that?
Tsuneo: Ssh.

> While it may not have done much good against that thing out
> there, it always felt better to have it with him.

Natasha: Considering that this is a lemon, I don't even want to think about that!

> What he saw out the rear window made him gasp.

> Unfortunately, it seemed that the angry cabbit was not faring well.

Tsuneo: [Shouting] Yeah! Go Sachiel! Beat it to a pulp!
Dan: [Shouting] Maim the sucker, Ryo-ohki!
Rick: I sense another holy war approaching.

> Katsuragi had screeched to a halt upon seeing Ryo-ohki, obviously not
> prepared to see something like her at all.

Dan: Umm... Haven't we already had this part of the story?

> Tenchi couldn't blame her, he was shocked the first time he saw it too.

Rick: You know, maybe it has appeared before.
Tsuneo: In which case, it's not in anything I want to see.
Rick: True. Too true.

>	Both occupants of the beat up car leapt out, still staring at the
> strange phenomenon.

Natasha: Even though the smart thing to do would have been to stay in the car
	and get away from there ASAP.
Tsuneo: It's a fanfic. Dan't ask for logic.
Dan: Now I know we've seen this before.

> Tenchi was beginning to worry about Ryo-ohki, when suddenly, she disappeared.

All: HOORAY!

> This time it was Katsuragi's turn to gasp,

Rick: Even though she was doing the gasping before.
Tsuneo: [Misato] Gasp! Your turn. Oh, you pass? Fine. Gasp!

> Tenchi could hear it quite clearly in the sudden silence.  However, Tenchi
> knew better.  He could just make out the smaller dark spot that marked

Tsuneo: [Vague] I see a bright light...
Natasha: Ion Cannon charging.

>	"What the hell is that?"  Katsuragi called out from the other side
> of the car.
>	Tenchi turned to her, wondering for a moment at how good she looked,
> even after being beat up so bad.

Dan: [Groans]

> "That is Ryo-ohki."  He stated simply, pointing at the growing ball of energy.

Tsuneo: No, that's a ball of energy. What's creating it is Ryo-ohki.

>	"What's it doing?"  She then asked, obviously curious about the ship's

Rick: What do YOU think?

>	"Fighting."  He answered.

Rick: [Shouting] Oh my god! They killed Sachiel!
Tsuneo: [Ditto] You bastards!

Natahsa: So, how does a rampaging alien menace look shocked?
Tsuneo: It blinked maybe?
Natahsa: What?
Tsuneo: It blinks. That angel blinks.
Natasha: Fine. [Pause] I wonder how heavy that coffee table is?

>	"Wow," He heard Katsuragi comment, "It's as if the AT Field wasn't
> even there."

Rick: Cue the inconcistency.
Tsuneo: Too late.

>	"The what?"  Tenchi asked, turning to her.

Rick: The AT field! Listen for once!

>	He saw Katsuragi's eyes widen,

Dan: Surely that's impossible. [Tsuneo throws a cushion at him]

Rick: But I thought Ryo-ohki was miles above, zogging it.
Tsuneo: Ssh. Naughty.

Rick: You know what? Land prices in Tokyo 3 must be really low.
Dan: [Dumb voice] Oh, no, down I go.

>  Tenchi just hoped she was okay.
>	"Back in the car."  He heard Katsuragi tell him.

Rick: [Misato] Into the backseat with you! [Dan smacks him on the back
	of the head]
Dan: Now cut that out!

Rick: TAKE THAT, GAS!

Dan: No, but he could make a pass on you if you like.
Natasha: That was pathetic.

>	Tenchi had no idea why she would think he'd have a pass.  "Um, no." He

Rick: Maybe it's because he's clearly aware that she's mistaking him for

[All clear their throats noisily]

Rick: Wait a sec - I thought they were still in the car!

Tsuneo: It's called a vehichle elevator. Learn the term, and save us all some

[All make electric shock noises]
Tsuneo: Never mind relitivity...
Rick: That is _really_ nitpicky.
Tsuneo: Give me one good reason to back off.

> They seemed to be heading a long way down, he wondered

Dan: Well- [Gets hailed with cushions.]
Rick: Well, they are in the car now, so it's not to far to the back seat.
[Dan whacks him repeatedly with a cushion.]

> He decided he might want to use this time to get some questions answered.

Dan: Aw, come on, what kind of a dumb idea is that?
Rick: This is Tenchi we're talking about.

> However, before he could turn to the strange

Natasha: CRASH! Oops! Sorry, I broke your geofront.

Rick: Um, didn't you just say that?
Natasha: First it's not enough description, then it's too much. Make up

Dan: And this is the guy who lives with Washu?

Tsuneo: Boring.

---------------------------------------

Natasha: Wouldn't it be your dress that's torn and tattered?

Rick: That's right, 200 kilometers of geofront with convenient access to
	transport. A unique fixer-upper opportunity.

>	After I touch up my lipstick,

Natasha: Over her torn and tattered lips.

Tsuneo: No, she's probably busy dealing with the Angel. She's got a job,
	you know.
Rick: Besides which, it's you she's missing.
Tsuneo: Who wants to clobber him for that one?

> and then I say, "Ne, Shinji-kun..
> you haven't seen your father in a long time.

Dan: [Tenchi] Not since breakfast, at least.
Rick: Hey, in the Masaki household, that is a long time.

> Have you missed him much?",

Natasha: Yeah, I need a new gunsight.

> thinking, 'Yeah, I bet that he missed that bastard just tons...'

Tsuneo: That bastard weighs tons!

>	He looks at me, and stumbles out, "Father?" I nod, smiling. He
> continues sheepishly, "I suppose so.."

[Stunned silence]
Dan: NO! It was just this morning! He couldn't have been gone more than
	a few hours! Besides, wouldn't he be more worried about Grandpa or the
	girls?
Rick: You know, you REALLY think he would have told her by now.
Dan: That's what I've been saying!

>	I say, "I understand, Shinji-kun. My relationship with my father
> wasn't the best, either.

Tsuneo: Whaoh there, lady. You just met him a few minutes ago, he's hardly
	spoken to you, and now you're telling him your life story?
Natasha: Well they did kiss.
Tsuneo: [Angry] Yes... I hadn't forgot that one.

> But now since you'll get to see him, maybe you

Rick: [Tenchi] Yeah! For starters, I'm not his son!
Dan: Stop that! I wanted to do that!

> I smile at him again, and he shrinks into his seat.

Tsuneo: Maybe your upholstery's a bit too soft.

---------------------------------------

Tsuneo: So, in otherwords, although he was blathering, he wasn't.
Rick: That's about it.

Natasha: Especially given how torn and tattered she is.

Tsuneo: No, they headed to a personnel elevator. Bad boy. Bad. No biscuit.

> It slid open silently, however, it wasn't empty.

Rick: Oh no! We're going to have the 'how many clowns can you fit into an
	elevator' routine again.
Tsuneo: About now's when Ritsuko turns up and tells her how lost she is.

Natasha: Washboard stature?
Rick: So he's small, flat and designed for rubbing clothes on?
Dan: And who around here wears sunnies anyway?

> and the most militaristic look he had ever seen in a

Dan: Aaah. So this is the OVA version. About time he made that clear.
Natasha: Does that really matter?
Others: Yes.

>	"Commander Ikari."  Katsuragi said, as if shocked to see the man.

Rick: Misato, about now would be a good time to consider your resignation.
Dan: If he doesn't shoot her on the spot.
Natasha: I wish.

All: Yes.

> The man brought that thought to an abrupt halt. 

Tsuneo: By blowing the bridge and sending it off a cliff.
Dan: Oh, the humanity!
Rick: I wish he'd bring this fanfic to an abrupt halt.

>	"Who is this?"  He asked, his expression not changing one iota.

Natasha: [Misato] This is your son, remember? You had this little accident
	with your wife about fourteen years ago.
Rick: [Gendo] That's odd, my wife and I haven't had sex in over twenty years.
Dan: You know, that explains a lot.

>	"This is Ikari Shinji."  Katsuragi answered, though her voice sounded

All: No.

>	"No, it is not, Katsuragi-ichii."

All: See?
Dan: By about now, her head's going to explode.
Natasha: We wish.

> The Commander returned in the same

> "Who are you, boy?"

Dan: Not your son, for starters.
Rick: Yes, Dan, I think we'd established that by now.

Dan: It's hard. VERY hard.

Dan: DUCK!

---------------------------------------

Tsuneo: [Marvin the Martian] What? No Earth-shattering kaboom?

>	As the elevator opened, we were face to face with Commander Ikari.

Rick: Hasn't this just happened?

Dan: well, for that, first you need-
Natasha: Give it up. It's too easy.

---------------------------------------

Rick: They ain't gonna?
Tsuneo: You know, if Rebecca was here, she would have inserted a very dirty
	comment about now.
Dan: [Misato] You never know. This is a lemon, remember? [Gets hailed with
	cushions.]
Rick: You couldn't help it, could you?

>	She blanched a little.  "Do you think that is wise, sir?"

Rick: Let's see, hmmm... My wife's dead now... You seeing anyone? Besides-
Others: Ritsuko, we know.
Rick: You sure she's not here?

>	"We have no choice."

Dan: I really don't want to think about that one.

> With that, the doors slid shut, leaving the two

>	Tenchi finally got entirely fed up.  He turned to Katsuragi and

All: HOORAY!
Natasha: It speaks!
Rick: At last! Intelligence!

>	The Captain, on her part, looked a lot more stressed then she did
> previously.

Natasha: And torn and tattered, but never mind.

> She looked at the determined man before her and sighed.

---------------------------------------

Dan: Ugh! Must- fight- perspective- changes!

>	"Uh, Shi-,

Natasha: Language!

> no, Masaki-san, you remember that big ugly black thing outside, right?",

Rick: You mean the one wearing the glasses?
Tsuneo: Ouch.

> I asked. Tenchi nodded. I continued, "Well, we're here

> finishing the sentence with a weak smile.

All: [Laugh weakly]

>	Someone pokes me in the back of the head.

Tsuneo: With a jackhammer, sending my brains spraying everywhere.
Rick: I wish.
Natasha: Not that it would make much difference, mind.

> "Katsuragi-ichii, was beer
> the only thing that you had for breakfast this morning?",

Rick: Probably.

> a woman's voice
> rang out behind me. I spin around, along with Tenchi, to see who was doing

>	"Ah! Ritsuko!"

Rick: [Misato] Hi honey! [Dan clouts him with a cushion again.]

> I place a hand behind my head and laugh nervously. I
> look to her side and see that she has brought a boy with her also. I
> giggle, "So, was this event a 'Bring-Your-Own-Boy'?"

Dan: Owie.
Tsuneo: Pain!
Natasha: That was disgusting.

> I flinch at the three
> people staring at me, and think, "Boy, was that a loss... dumb mouth."

Dan: You said it!
Rick: This fanfic's a loss!

>	Ritsuko speaks,

Dan: By moving her mouth and running air through her vocal cords, but that's
	not important right now.

> "Katsuragi Misato, this is Ikari Shinji... you know,
> the boy that you were supposed to pick up."

Dan: [Misato] I didn't even know I was going on a blind date.

> I smile at the boy, who seems indifferent.

Rick: At least he got Shinji's character right.

> Ritsuko looks at Tenchi, puzzled at the resemblance.

Dan: That is: none.
Others: [Shouting] WE KNOW!

> She smiles, "Ah, who is this?"

Rick: The man with the N2 mine in his pocket.
Natasha: Ew!

>	I say, "This is Masaki Tenchi, I, uh, picked him up before the Angel
> had a chance to squash him.

Dan: [Misato] He followed me home. Can I keep him?

> Masaki-san, this is Dr. Akagi Ritsuko.

Rick: You know, given that he had to live with Washu, and especially given
	her attempts to collect samples, he would feel right at home with Ritsuko.

> You'll
> find her to be a lot nicer than Ikari Gendou, the guy you just met. And
> your "twin"

Dan: [Misato] Who you don't look anything like, but I'm calling you twins
	anyway.
Rick: This _is_ Misato we're talking about. After about nine in the morning,
	I bet everyone looks the same to her.

Tsuneo: AACK! Thump! [Tenchi] I know she was dumb, but did you really have
	to do that to her?

> and I think that there really is
> more than meets the eye when it comes to those two.

Rick: Well you already figured that one out with Tenchi.
Dan: [Shudders] Don't remind me.

> I press the down
> button on the elevator, and the four of us walk inside. I look at the
> panel of buttons inside of the elevator, and Ritsuko reaches around me and
> presses the button marked 'Terminal Dogma.'

Rick: I'll bet that's not all she pressed.
Natasha: [Bhuddist monk] I'm sorry, but my karma has run over your dogma.

>	Ritsuko says, "Misato-san, perhaps if I accompany you, you won't get
> lost this time, ne?"

Tsuneo: Oh, she'll manage it somehow.

> Of course, Ritsuko says that playfully, but without a
> smile... that's her way.

Tsuneo: No, she says it to drum into Misato the fact of just how worthless
	she is.

> I nod, remembering the several hours I had spent
> in confusion wandering around the HQ. The elevator door shuts.

---------------------------------------

Tsuneo: Thank god! The end!
Dan: Not yet.
Rick: Be strong.

>	Sasami

Tsuneo: AARGH! [He collapses to the floor in a dead faint. The others
	ignore him.]
Natasha: Wimp.

> looked at her surroundings.  She could still see a big dark
> spot in her vision

Dan: Who just happened to be touring during the Angel attack.
Rick: That was lame.

> from the intense brightness that had overtaken her
> before.  She could make out various beds,

Rick: I have an impending sense of lemon.

> and the smell most definitely suggested a hospital of some kind.

Dan: That's a relief!

> As her eyesight cleared completely her
> theory was confirmed.  It was an infirmary, there were trauma bunks lining
> the walls, about four to a side.  What soon demanded her immediate
> attention was the fact that one of the beds was occupied.

Dan: [Sasami] What are those two doing in that one bed I wonder?
Natasha: Naughty boy!

> She walked up
> to the prone figure, who was bandaged up pretty good, and whose wounds
> looked only minutes old.

Rick: DEFINITE lemon alert.

>	The first thing Sasami noticed about the person was that they were
> female, and young.  Couldn't be more than thirteen years old or so.

Natasha: I suppose this is where we get to the lesbo schoolgirls in sailor
	suits, right?
Dan: I don't want to think about it.

> The
> next thing she noticed was how much like herself she looked, only with
> lighter skin and shorter hair.

[Dead silence]
Rick: What?
Dan: Are you trying to tell me that that's Rei - and they look ALIKE?!?
Rick: For starters, Rei looks older.
Dan: And her hair's a lighter colour.
Rick: And she doesn't have freckles.
Dan: And her eyes take up less than half her face.
Rick: And she's got a nose.
Dan: Amd her hair doesn't have an antigravity function.
Rick: On the other hand, they do have something in common.
Dan: What?
Rick: Both dress up in sailor suits and blow bubbles at silly monsters.
[A cushion shoots up from the floor and hits Rick. Tsuneo gets up, and
reclaims his seat.]
Natasha: Welcome back.
Tsuneo: Thanks... I think.

> She was almost tempted to open an eye to
> see if it were the same color as hers.  She'd never met a human with
> anywhere near the eye color she had. 

Natasha: Or the hair colour for that matter.
Dan: And you won't in this place.
Rick: And you're saying that Rei's human?
Dan: My point exactly.
Tsuneo: Grr...

>	It almost scared Sasami to death when the still figure's eyes came
> open suddenly.

Rick: Of course, given that this is her all bandaged up, that should be
	in the singular.
Dan: Anyway, I thought she was busy fighting Sachiel.
Rick: Smile.
Dan: Or about to be dragged into Unit 01's cooling tank.
Rick: Nod.

> Once she got over the initial shock, curiosity reigned, and
> she peeked into the girl's face again.  Red, not pink, but red.  How close
> it was almost made Sasami's heart stop anyway. 

Rick: Try harder next time.
Dan: And that red does not look anything like Sasami's pink eyes.
Rick: Pink eye. Definitely pink eye.

>	The girl looked over at Sasami almost passively.  "Who are you?" She
> asked in the most monotonous voice Sasami would ever want to hear from a
> seemingly living creature.

Rick: [Eccles] You call dis living?
Tsuneo: Do you know what I like about Rei Ayanami.
Dan: No.
Tsuneo: Her passion.
Rick: [Worried] Okaaay. Right. I'm going to assume that was a joke.

>	"I'm Sasami."  She replied cheerfully.  "Pleased to meet you."

Rick: Great. Incessantly chirpy meets death in a plugsuit.
Natasha: I think I may vomit.

> She bowed slightly.

Tsuneo: And fell over.
Dan: Carefull. Lesser things have resulted in lemons.

> 	The girl looked on, unblinking and expressionless.

Rick: Yup! This guy's got Rei's character perfect!
Dan: What character?
Rick: See?
Tsuneo: You take that back!

> Sasami was
> beginning to reevaluate her previous conclusion that this person was
> actually alive.

Dan: Smart move.
Natasha: Very observant, you little munchkin.

> "What are you doing here?" Came the next query.

Tsuneo: [Sasami] I'm in one of the worst setup scenes ever in a bad lemon
	crossover fanfic.

>	Of course, Sasami didn't even know *where* she was, never the less why
> she was there.  "I'm not sure really.  I'm here sort of by accident you
> see."

Rick: Best way to get into an emergency ward.
Tsuneo: The writer had too much to drink the previous night.

> She wasn't sure how much she should be telling about her origins
> either so kept it simple.  She smiled a bit.  "Um, would you mind telling
> me where I am?"

Natasha: [Rei] You're in- [Gets hailed with cushions.]
Tsuneo: Stop stealing my lines! [Gets hailed with cushions.]

>	The girl's face still didn't alter in the slightest.

Rick: Acting!

> If she thought
> the question was odd, she showed no signs of it.  "You are in the
> infirmary."  She answered simply.

Dan: Well, that's _really_ helpfull.
Rick: You know, has she ever considered a career as a systems analyst?
Tsuneo: How about technical support?
Natasha: Nah. To nice and friendly.
Dan: To warm and caring.

>	Well, I know that, thought Sasami.  "Yes, um, what city is this?"

Dan: Obviously, she missed the blatant sign in the middle of the city.

> She
> glanced out the window and saw a totally unfamiliar skyline. Though, she
> had to admit, by the landscape, it seemed she was still in Japan.

Rick: Uh, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we have the Second Impact,
	which sort of did in the landscape?
Dan: And how can she tell it's Japan anyway? Especially if she's in Nerv's
	infirmary which is underground.
Tsuneo: Actually, they use one in Tokyo 3 all the time.
Dan: So what's Rei doing there during Sachiel's attack?
Tsuneo: Um...

>	"This is Tokyo 3."
>	Sasami spun on the girl again.

Dan: I'm sure we can don something with that one. [Natahsa reaches inside
	her jacket] Uhh... Maybe not.

> "What?"  She blurted out, unable to contain her outburst.

Rick: She said Tokyo 3! Listen for once!

>	"This is Tokyo 3."  She repeated.

Rick: See!
Tsuneo: Okay, okay, Rick.

>	Sasami wasn't sure what to do.  The city outside the window was most
> definitely not the Tokyo she knew.  It seemed much more futuristic for
> one.

Dan: In what precise way?

> She almost slapped herself in the forehead.

Tsuneo: But missed.

> Of course! she thought,
> Washuu's machine must have put her in the future.  But how far? "What time
> is it?"

Rick: 10 to death?
Natasha: Time to end this fic?

>	The girl glanced at the clock on the wall.  "Nine forty-one."

Rick: [Bored] B-doom tish.
Tsuneo: [Bored] Ha ha whoopee.

>	Okay, thought Sasami, let's rephrase that.  "What's the date?"
>	"It's February 4, 2015", the pale girl answered.
>	Okay, so she'd traveled nineteen years into the future.  Now, how to
> get back?  Sasami got lost in thought for a moment.  As she was pondering,
> a loud crash sounded from outside. Knocked out of her reflecting,

Tsuneo: Causing the mirror on the opposite wall to stop showing her
	reflection.
Dan: Tsunami's reflection.
Tsuneo: Fanboy.
Rick: Whatever. Hopefully it fell on her head and killed her.

> Sasami
> ran to the window to see what was happening.  What she saw outside both
> frightened and overjoyed her.  For, outside, mecha-Ryo-ohki was there.

Tsuneo: Along with the stolen grammar checker.
Rick: We have comma sign!!!

> Unfortunately, she seemed to be fighting something, something very big,
> that seemed to be winning.

All: YAY!
Rick: Go Sachiel!

---------------------------------------

>	Washu traversed the time-stream, looking for the crucial moment.

Tsuneo: Where someone had decided to write- [Gets hailed with cushions.]

> The
> instant where the future of Earth was sent down the path to imminent
> destruction.

Tsuneo: When the fic was written. [Braces for impact] What, nothing?
Dan: No complaints there.

> She was finding it more difficult than originally anticipated.

Tsuneo: She had to read the stupid thing to find out.
Dan: I feel sorry for her.

> She turned into another lateral tangent, and started
> searching another trillion vertices.

Tsuneo: That's one hell of a search engine.
Rick: Maybe it's the new UN Yahoo!

>	"Tokimi, I'll find you."  She muttered, the words scattered to the
> ages.

Dan: And I won't even begin on how much THAT one mucks with the
	fundamentals of Washu's character!

---------END PART ONE----------

All: HOORAY!

> Thanks for reading... send comments please!

Tsuneo: He asked for it!

> The second part of this will be worked on soon.

Natasha: We can wait.

> The first part was devoid of any lemon scenes to
> promote story and character growth.

All: WHAT???
Natasha: Gggrrr...

> Till next time
> PMasters
> and
> Katsuragi Misato ^_^

[The coffee table picks itself up and hurtles across the room, smashing
itself through the screen of the TV]

Natasha: That made me feel MUCH better.
Voice: Gee, thanks.
Natasha: It deserved it.
Dan: Go on, tell us she was wrong.
Voice: [Ignoring him] So guys, commentary?
Rick: Put simply: it sucked. Crap characterisation, terrible POV,
	irritating scene changes, bad writing and of course its a lemon. Supposedly.
	Added to that, it drags together two fundamentally incompatible shows.
Tsuneo: The worst thing about it was the sheer stupidity of the whole thing.
	The authour didn't seem to have thought it through, and made sure that the
	characters didn't have a single brain cell between them. Plus it was so OOC
	that it wasn't funny.
Dan: It just... felt wrong. The whole idea of that crossover is bad to start
	with, and to have the lemon element hanging over our heads just made it worse.
	I'd love to know where he gets his delusions about the characters'
	similarities from.
Natasha: I have never read an aminay fanfic before and I never will again. My
	only regret was that I didn;t smash the TV earlier.
Voice: Uhh... right. Anything else?
Tsuneo: Only that anyone who thinks they're Misato should seek professional help. 
Voice: Fine. Well, that's today's job over and done with. You're free to go.
Tsuneo: So, Natasha, are you going to be joining us full-time on this?
Natasha: Yeah, right. Rebecca can have her stinky job back.
Dan: I'm not sure wheather to be relieved or not...

[The screen goes black]

Rick: That's another two ships to sink.

*A damnably good flight sim - go play it!
