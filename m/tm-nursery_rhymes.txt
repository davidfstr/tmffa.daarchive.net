Tenchi Muyo Nursery Rhymes 
(Bonus = On Top of Tenchi)

(To the tune of Three Blind Mice)
One blind Tenchi.One blind Tenchi
See how he runs...See how he runs
-He ran away from the pirate fair
-with the goddess gold eyes
-and sweet cyan hair
-if only he knew of how much she cared
One blind Tenchi.One blind Tenchi

(To the tune of Pop Goes the Weasel) 
All around the Misaki home
Ryoko fought Aeka 
Till finally Tenchi announced his love
Then POP!
Went Aeka.
A wedding for the handsome prince
A wedding for his bride Ryoko
All is fair in love and war
POP!
Goes Aeka.
All around the Misaki home
They were at it till they got lock-jaw
And with a little help from little Washu
Noboyuki was soon a grand-pa!  

(To the tune of 3 Little Kittens)
There was a young guy
who lost his daddy's henti 
and he began to plea:
Oh Father dear, forgive me here, your Henti I have lost!
What, lost my henti, you naughty young guy, now you shall have no 
"tea"!
There was a young guy
who found his daddy's henti
and he cried out with glee:
Oh father dear, see, look here, your henti I have found!
What, found my henti, you splendid young guy, now you shall have some 
"tea"!
There was a young guy
Who stained his daddy's henti
and he mumbled guiltily 
Um, father dear, maybe you shouldn't look here, your henti I have 
stained.
WHAT!  Stained my henti?  You NASTY young guy! 
Get your filthy hands away from my "tea"!
There was a young guy
Who replaced his daddy's henti
And he called out triumphantly 
Oh father dear, come feast your eyes here, your sexkitten henti I have 
replaced
What, replaced my sexkitten henti, you clever young guy 
Now you shall have some "TEA"!
 
Meyow.Meyow..MEYOW!

(Ok. these next one's are even worse)
(To the tune of Old mother Hubbard)
Old mother Washu went into her lab
to get a sample from Tenchi's bone
but when she got there
little Tenchi was too scared
and so little Washu got none!

(To the tune of Jack sprat)
Aeka Jeri kept on eating pie
Till she became very fat
So they painted her orange, stuck a sprout on her head,
and fed her to the cute bunny-cat!

Bonus
(To the tune of On Top of Spaghetti) 

Oh please tell me Tenchi
Where did you leave your nuts?
You're set up like a pimp, boy
but you act like a putz!

You've got a sweet princess
with shiny pink eyes
and two cute little girls who
are goddesses in disguise!

You wont take advantage
of the galaxy's biggest Bim-bo
or even acknowledge
your love for Ry-o-ko!

You just run away
when one of them gets too near
If I didn't know any better
I'd swear you were queer! 

You had better grow up
and be more than a friend
or one day you'll wake up
in a house of lonely old men!
