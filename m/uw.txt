Somebody shoot me for this one.

Okay, I  gotta give a warning.  This is for my own amusement, and is not
intended to offend anyone.

Pioneer and AIC own these characters.  I'm just using them for a second.

This is just a quick (but funny!) Tenchi Muyo! fanfic.  Its based off
the OVA, so I don't have Misa in it.

Tenchi Muyo!

The Ultimate Weapon

==========

        Tenchi is seen working on something, but we can only see his head and
shoulders.  "Some times the strangest things can happen.  Three days
ago, Kagato returned.  And, that's when everything went bad."

Three days ago.

        Tenchi and the others are all working in the fields, planting the
endless rows of vegetables.  Suddenly, a green sphere appears in front
of them.

        Tenchi, realizing what it is, pulls out Sword Tenchi.  Ryoko, also
knowing, instantly changes into her battle outfit.  Ayeka puts the rest
of the group within her force field.

        Kagato, appearing, "I see you're prepared to fight.  That's good for
you.  But, I haven't come to fight.  I have come to make you all my
slaves."

        "Keep dreaming, Kagato!" Ryoko shouts, beam sword in hand.

        "Oh, but this is not a dream.  I have found the most horrible weapon in
the universe, right here on Earth."  He motions his hand, and a larger
green sphere appears, which spits out a large stereo.

        "You're kidding, right?" Tenchi asks.

        "No I am not.  As I said, this is the most horrible thing in the
universe," he says, slamming down the PLAY button, "COUNTRY MUSIC!"

        The music starts, and Alan Jackson starts singing.

        "NO!" Ayeka yells, her ears covered, "anything but that, ANYTHING!"

        "Turn it off, PLEASE!" Tenchi yells.

        "I can't take it anymore!" Ryoko screams.

        <This is easier than I thought!> Kagato thinks.

==========

        The scene changes back to Tenchi working.  "And there you have it.
That's how it all happened.  Tsunami was then put under Kagato's
control, and he went to conquer the universe.  After that, the girls
were taken as personal slaves, if you know what I mean.  And what am I
doing, you ask?"  The scene zooms out to Tenchi in front of a mountain
of potatoes.

End!

Just remember:  Those with good creativity also have a good sense of
humor!
