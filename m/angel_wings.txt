Angel Wings, a poem

By Angel "Sailor Empyrean" (SlrEmpyrean@aol.com)






In the dark depths of dreams,

A silent angel lies, asleep.

Her wings folded at her back

As she sleeps silently, in a world of peace.

Feathers fall from the sky,

Rose petals bathe the world in a radiant red,

The red of blood,

Dark and pure.

She is torn from her dream world,

Her world of innocence and purity,

To face a world tainted with blood

And save it from its own destruction.

Fly, young beauty, innocent angel.

Take off on uncharted wings.

Be free, thy beauty,

Live on.

But she does not turn her head and run.

She faces danger with an iron will

And a strong heart,

With a strength the beholder only wishes for.

He cries out to her

As she crashes into battle,

Her hands already stained with blood,

Hands of a warrior, now.

"My angel, sweet angel,"

he cries, holding her in his arms.

"My dearest, sweetest angel,

what happened to your beautiful innocence?"

She smiles weakly up at him,

Though her face is streaked with blood,

And tells him not to worry

As she fades into the night.

And he is left there, all alone,

With nowhere else to turn.

His blood-stained angel in his hands,

With only his heart to yearn.
