Kiyone #2 (or The Green Poem)

Let your hair dance in the wind,
Green as forest, green as fern
Let your eyes sparkle in the light,
Cool as mint, sweet as dew on the roses.

All life is green.
It floats in the sea,
    It shows in your eyes.

Sing to me, in your kelly-green voice
Vibrant as earth,
Serene as dawn
Weave your voice into an endless song.

In the firelight, you sparkle,
In the daylight, you shine
But in the moon's clear light, you glow.

Dance with me, 
Spin in the breeze,
Glittering, shimmering,
To the music-box song of the world.
