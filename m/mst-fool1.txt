Red-Head MST...
(We see Ryo-oh-ki & P-chan looking through wedding magazines, as we hear sounds
of the Tardis moving. Washu comes in and looks at them, glaring at P-chan in
particular. Ryo-oh-ki looks up at Washu.)
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa?
Washu: No, you can't have the "Jeopardy!" theme song as your love song. I don't
*care* if both of you love Alex Trebek... (The Tardis machine stops humming.
There's a jolt. Andrew enters the room.)
Andrew: We've landed. (Ranma appears.)
Ranma: Say...what's with all of these columns and stuff?
Washu: Great, we've landed in a Xerox commerical.
(Suddenly Belldandy, Urd, Skuld, and Tenchi appear, and they do not look
pleased.)
Belldandy: Hey! Your Tardis and that Patalabor of yours is double parked in our
reserved spaces!
Washu: Don't tell me we've died and gone to heaven... (Ryo-oh-ki looks happy.)
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa!!!
Washu: You mean, you *want* to be married here!
Skuld (suddenly looks pleased): A wedding...here in heaven? Wai! (She dances
around P-chan and Ryo-oh-ki. (Suddenly Belldandy pulls out a mallet and @baps
Skuld.) B-b-belldandy?! What for!
Belldandy: You know better than to dance around the engaged couple...it's bad
luck. (P-chan faints. Ranma laughs. Andrew pulls out an sledgehammer and
whallops Ranma.)
Washu: No!!!

A-ko: Alright, let's get that 64 team bracket filled out! In the first round
of the East bracket #1 Akane Tendo goes up against #16 Lara Croft...
Andrew: Um, A-ko, it's called "Morning Madness"...not "March Madness."
A-ko: Oh.

>>Sasami sat down and pulled out a book from a small brown bag sitting on
>>the dining table.

Washu(imitating Ayeka): Say, Sasumi, what'cha reading?
Andrew (imitating Sasumi): "Fifteen Easy Cabbit Stew Recipies."
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa! (The cabbit takes P-chan and whaps Andrew with him.)

                    She began browsing through it.  Always wanting to
>>diversify her menu, the princess had bought several books from a
>foreign book store.  Sasami emptied the bag onto the table, she noticed an
>extra book.  Perhaps the sales clerk had misplaced it by accident.

Lina: Maybe it was so unpopular they were "accidently" giving it away.
Izumi: Like what books could be so unpopular?
Belldandy (who enters the room): Well, there was the illustrated Katra Suma for
the blind, and the Redneck cookbook, and the Quatum Mechanics for Dummies
book...
Izumi: Okay, you've made your point!

                                                                      Having
>>read the title, Sasami got excited and hastily deposited all the books
>>into the safety of their original container.  She hurried and hopped
>>onto the nearby sofa and began reading the book.  The book, having to
>>deal with various holidays and traditions of different Earth cultures,
>>peaked the interests of the young princess.

Ranma: "Chapter One: Getting Drunk on New Years Eve."
Andrew: "Chapter Two: Getting Drunk on Mardi Gras."
Washu: "Chapter Three: Getting Plastered at One's Wedding..." (She starts to
cry.)

>>
>>Ryo-ohki entered the room and hopped on Sasami’s lap.  There, the
>cabbit fell into a light slumber in the warmth of of her companion.  She
>barely acknowledged the cabbits presence and continued to read the book with
>>great interest.
>>
>>"AH HA!" Sasami finally proclaimed in great excitement. The cabbit
>>awoken to the pig-tailed girl's sudden outburst.

Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa! (She pouts.)
Washu: I know...you're got a cameo role.
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa!
Lina (to Washu): Why is she upset?
Washu: Cabbits don't like to have their sleep disturbed.

                                                   Sasami received and
>>idea that a part of her really liked.  It awakened a part that we
>rarely saw.  She knew better not to go forward with the idea, but it had taken
>>over.  Her conscious was throw aside as this idea churned in her head.
>>
>>"Miya?" Ryo-ohki wondered as the princess gently placed the cabbit on
>>her head.  Sasami smiled wickedly.  She would need to prepare.  Yes.
>>Prepare for what she has planned for the rest of her family.

Izumi (in mock horror): Oh, no! Sasami is going to replace the coffee they drink
with Folger's Crystals!!!
Andrew: Now seriously, why would anyone switch coffee brands. (He takes a sip of
a cup of coffee...) Hey, this isn't the caffinated stuff!
Ranma (smiling): That's right, Andrew, I've replaced the caffinated Maxwell
House we usually drink with Decaf Folger's Cry---(Everyone throws their coffee
at him. P-chan pulls a chain and a huge spray of hot coffee spills on Ranma.)

>>
>>***
>>
>>Sitting on her floating pillow, Washu, the greatest scientific genius
>in the universe, was busy devising a plan on getting that last sample she
>>needed.  Her previous attempts had failed thanks to interruptions by a
>>certain blond detective.

Washu: That Mioshi is so dumb...
Everyone else: How dumb is she?
Washu: She's so dumb she ran around my circular lab for hours after I told to
sit in a corner...(There's a sound of a rimshot.)
Andrew: Okay...so far, everything is looking pretty good in terms of the fic.

>>
>>The famous mad scientist train of thought was interrupted when she
>>noticed a visitor had arrived with the ringing of her crab bell.  Turning her
>>head, she smiled.

Lina (imitating Sasumi/Bates): Hello, Mother-in-law!
Andrew: Yeah, like I can see Tenchi getting killed in a shower...
Izumi: Well, at least we can see his kawaii naked hunk of beef! (Andrew falls
over. Izumi sighs.)

>>
>>"Hello Sasami, is it tea time already?" Washu asked.
>>
>>"Nope." Sasami replied smiling.
>>
>>"May I help you then?"
>>
>>"Hai!  I want to play around a little.  May I borrow one of your
>>inventions?  I believe it was reference number 1998-69666"
>>
>>"Why would you want to borrow that toy?"

Akemi: Say, Washu, is she wanting to borrow that Ultra-kawaii vibrator you
invented?
Washu (blushing): Um, no...I think I lend that to Urd.
Urd (popping through the door, smiling): Oh, you want that back?

>>
>>Sasami simply grinned.
>>
>>Washu grinned in return.  "So do you need anything else from me?"
>>
>>Sasami nodded.  "Can you disappear for just tomorrow?  Seal the door to
>>your dimension and place a sign that says 'I am busy working on another
>>plant, I'll be back in a few days'."

Andrew: Now, should that be "plan" or "planet?"
Akemi: What difference does it make?
Andrew: This is a plan. (He @baps Akemi with a rolled-up blue-print with a
Wiley E. Coyote signature.)
A-ko: And this is a planet. (She pulls a cord and Saturn lands on Akemi, and no,
we're not talking about Sailor Saturn or a car.)

>>
>>"Ummm... Sure but..."
>>
>>"Don't worry."  The princess smiled, "no harm will be done."
>>
>>"Sure, but I am only letting you borrow this device because I trust you
>>won't abuse it for personal gains like the others will."

Izumi: Gee, there really isn't much going on here.
Washu: Sasami is a girl of few words.
A-ko: Well, she's does seem a bit out-of-character. She's usually not this
naughty.

>>
>>The princess simply nods.
>>
>>Washu suddenly snapped her fingers and a small device appeared in her
>>hands.  It was approximately the size of your average TV remote control
>>with several multicolored buttons on top.  "I will 'disappear'
>>tomorrow.  Have fun Sasami-chan"

Ranma (as he's drying off...yes, he's naked): Ah, geeze, all she wants to get
the Spice Channel...
(P-chan is upside down and having a nose bleed as he sees the Playboy Dec. issue
with Kattrina Witt. Ryo-oh-ki notices and jumps on P-chan.)
P-chan: Bwee!!! (P-chan crashes the ceiling.)

>>
>>"Hai!" exclaimed Sasami, "I will"
>>
>>With that, Sasami hurried out of Washu's lab with the contraption in
>her arms.  Washu smiles at the departure of the little princess.  The
>>scientist immediately complied with Sasami’s request by sealing her lab
>>off from the Masaki house and placing the sign on the door.
>>
>>"Tomorrow will be a fun filled day in the Masaki household." Washu
>>exclaimed to herself as she double checked that her spy cameras all
>over the house were operational.  "I must keep an excellent record of the
>>upcoming events."

Washu: Fun-filled day...I haven't had a fun filled day since (screaming, point
to a very dizzy P-chan) that bastard took my cabbit away from me!!!
Andrew: C-calm down Washu. I mean, think of it this way, you aren't losing a
creation, you're gaining an experiment.
P-chan: Bwee!!!

>>
>>***
>>
>>Sasami awoke in the middle of the night.  The blue haired goddess
>>smiled. It was the day she was waiting for.  The day her plans would
>>take effect.
>>
>>The hands of a nearby clock were all pointing at the number three.  She
>>got up and carried Ryo-ohki to the hallway.  There, Sasami proceeded to
>>a near by linen closet and extracted Washu's invention from its hidden
>>alcove.  Sasami glanced about.  Ensured that her movements were not
>>monitored, she left.

Andrew: Ah, the classic sentence fragment!
Belldandy: That sentence should read: "Sasami glanced about, ensured that her
movements were not monitored. She left."
Urd (sighing): Thank you, Noah Webster.
Skuld: Who's Noah? (Urd, Andrew, & Belldandy face-fault.)

>>
>>The lights of the kitchen flickered on.  The blue haired one placed the
>>small device on the counter.  She smiles at Ryo-ohki.  The cabbit
>>returned the said smile.  She wanted Ryo-ohki's assurance that she is
>>still willing to help her in this adventure.
>>
>>"Ryo-ohki, are you sure you are willing to go along with my plan?"  The
>>princess asked.
>>
>>"Miya!"  The cabbit happily reaffirmed.

Washu: I think she said, "Are you sure that's a disco light?"
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa!
Washu: No, Ryo-oh-ki, you can't have Tenchi be the guy that escorts you down the
aisle as the father... (Ryo-oh-ki looks at Washu with big, large kawaii eyes
that are crying) o, okay. I guess you can. (Ryo-oh-ki hugs Washu.)

>>
>>Sasami pulled out a carrot and rewarded her willing accomplice.
>>Ryo-ohki happily munched on the carrot as the princess looks over the
>>device.  Sasami reexamined the manual Washu left with the devise.
>After a few minutes of skimming, the princess smiled.
>>
>>"Ready to go, Ryo-ohki?" Sasami asked.
>>
>>"Miya!" The cabbit replied happily.
>>
>>With Ryo-ohki following, Sasami headed for her first victim. She
>quietly sneaked up to the third floor of the Masaki house.  The mischievous
>>princess slowly opened the door to Tenchi's room.  With a giggle, she
>>entered.

Luna: And the next thing Tenchi knows he's doing one of those infomericals for
the red devil cooker.
Skuld: I have one of those, and it is great!
Urd: That's the last time we leave you alone in the house with Father, Skuld.
Skuld: But, Urd, Father wanted one of those things for Christmas last year! You
know how he hates to cook when we're not around!

>>
>>***
>>
>>The sun rose over the vocanic mountains of Japan.  Bright beams pierced
>>through a window into the eyes of its first victim.  Tenchi awoke
>>drowsily this fine morning.  He slowly got out of bed and didn't notice
>>anything different or for that matter unusual.  He decided to take a
>>quick refreshing shower.

Ranma (screaming): Watch out! Sasami might kill ya with a Ryo-ok-hi as a
spaceship/tank!!!
A-ko: This is not Psycho, Ranma! If it was, then Belldandy here would have a
hoook and start slashing people. (Belldandy pulls out a hook, and evily smiles.)
Andrew: Great, A-ko. Now you've got us on the "I still can't believe you knew it
wasn't butter Last Summer" movie...(everyone runs around while Belldandy walks
slowly towards the camera.)

>>
>>Tenchi left the room still not feeling much around his surroundings.
>>Last night Aeka and Ryoko had another one of their fights.  It lasted a
>>long time and he was still tired from the ordeal.
>>
>>Tenchi Masaki somehow found the shower in his drowsy state and removed
>>his cloths.  He hastily discarded his cloths in a nearby hamper, still
>>somewhat delirious form lack of sleep.  As he entered the shower, the
>>Jurian prince noticed something obviously different.  His eyes widened,
>>blood trickled form his nose, and he fell unconscious.

Ranma: Maybe Sasami got some Spring of Drowned Girl piped in from Jusenkyou.
Andrew: Maybe you should run! (Andrew gets slashed by Belldandy.)

>>
>>***
>>
>>The bright light also woke up a sleeping demoness.  She was exhausted
>>from last night.  Ryoko cursed to herself, <That damn Aeka.  She
>started it...  I still feel tired.  Damn!  Oh well, I guess I will go wake
>>Tenchi.>  She wickedly smiled as she got up and attempted to phase into
>>the nearby room.
>>
>>*BAAAM*
>>
>><Huh?> Ryoko thought, <Why can't I phase through this wall?> She tried
>>again to no avail.

Belldandy: Oh, my! What am I doing with this hook? (The hook disappears. Andrew
is revived.)
Urd: Don't tell me you've been sleepwalking again, sis...

>>
>>"BAAM*
>>
>><Hmmm, wait a minute!> Ryoko thought, <Why is Sasami sleeping in my
>>room?>  Then it struck her.
>>
>>"NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, It must be a dream!!!"

Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa?
Washu: Yes, I don't think Ryoko usually screams like that.

>>
>>***
>>
>>Aeka awoke to the sound of screaming which somehow seemed familiar.
>The princess cursed the demon that had to try, again, to steal her Tenchi
>>away from.  She got up and noticed a few things about her demeanor.
>She noticed that her breasts were more developed and that she was wearing a
>>tight, skimpy outfit similar to the one worn by a infamous space
>>pirate.  Aeka was in shock!
>>
>>"This can not be, this is not hap...." Aeka stopped talking to herself
>>and noticed the familiar voice that belongs to her enemy.  With quick
>>glance around the room confirming  her whereabouts, the princess
>>decided to react.
>>
>>"NNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!" cried the angered princess.

Andrew: That's right, folks, it's Monkey-Head-Butting, Tenchi Muyo style!
Ranma: Really, if that was the case, then we could all change places.
Lina: Who want to change places? (Skuld raises her hand.)
Andrew: Skuld?
Skuld: Well, I always wanted to be Irresponsible Captain Taylor for a week...

>>
>>***
>>
>>Mihoshi awoke to hear familiar bickering coming from the hall.  It
>>always seems that Ryoko and Aeka are always constantly fighting.  It
>was her duty as a Galaxy Police officer to maintain order.  Thus the
>>detective got up, totally unaware about the change in her wardrobe and
>>figure.

Washu: Then again, she was unware of anything...
Ranma: Yeach...I hope those pants are loose fitting ones...

>>         As he proceeded to the door to egress the room, she passed a
>>mirror.
>>
>>"Ohayoo Tenchi!" Mihoshi exclaimed to the mirror waving her hand as the
>>reflection waved back in a harmonized fashion.
>>
>>Not noticing anything unusual, the Galaxy Police detective headed out
>>the door of the third floor bedroom.  It was her duty as a Galaxy
>Police officer to stop their fighting.

Lina: And it was her duty to be stupid, too.
Luna: You know, this fic is rather boring. I mean it seems rather dull.
Andrew: Dull?
Luna: As in watching paint dry dull.

>>
>>***
>>
>>"Ryoko!  What do you think you are doing stealing my body!"  screamed
>>the princess in the body of the pirate.
>>
>>"What!  I didn't steal your body!  Why would I steal a body that
>doesn't even compared to my own!  I should be asking you that question!"  Ryoko
>>countered in Aeka's form.

(P-chan somehow finds a tub of hot water. He splashes in it.)
Ryouga: Man, am I glad to be a guy! Now, I've got to get out of here...
Ryo-ok-hi: Miyaa! (Ryouga smiles.)
A-ko: I don't know...I don't think I would want to have C-ko's body.
Lina: Yeah, or Amelia's body.
Andrew: Like I would want to steal Keiichi's body. (Andrew turns around and
Keiichi has Andrew's body and vice-versa.) D'oh!

>>
>>"Grrrrrr...  What do you mean?  I would never do such a thing I
>wouldn't want to have the body of a tainted character of your reputation"
>>
>>"Well, how bout if I taint your reputation with Tenchi?  Heh heh, A
>>crack of the whip sounds fun."
>>
>>"You wouldn't dare..."

Lina (imitating Ayeka/Stan): Oh, yeah, well I can beat up your little sorry ass
you fat-head!
A-ko (imitating Ryoko/Cartman): Oh, yeah, you fat bitch, at least IIII have your
body, you little twerp!
Andrew/Keiichi: Don't tell me this is happening...

>>
>>"Want to try me Princess.  After I am done with Tenchi, your reputation
>>won't get you squat."
>>
>>"Why you....."
>>
>>"Oh ho ho ho... Tenchi, you will concede to my love or pay the price...
>>Snap!"
>>
>>"And what if he finds out it was you using my body to do such nasty
>>things... you criminal!"
>>
>>"Ummm, Well...." Ryoko wavered.
>>
>>"Ill tell you!  Tenchi will probably hate you for abusing my body.  His
>>love for me will blossom.  You will be tossed aside like another piece
>>of trash!  Oh ho ho ho ho...."

Ranma: Ladies, you aren't Kodachi!
Washu: Yeah, I know. Sometimes I'd like for Sasami to beat to the punch and
screw the living daylights out of Tenchi. (Looks at Ryouga) Speaking of
screwing...
Ryouga: Um, I guess an appology is too late?

>>
>>"Aeka, Why I a......"
>>
>>Before Ryoko could intercede, a familiar male voice interrupted.
>>
>>"Won't you girls stop fighting!"  Mihoshi shouted not noticing the
>>change in her voice.

Belldandy: Oh, my! That blonde is really stupid! (Urd slaps Belldandy with a
dead fish.)
Urd: Sis, would you stop acting like Kasmi Tendo for once?

>>
>>Aeka and Ryoko tuned to the image of Tenchi and both simultaneously
>>replied to him,  "Sorry... Tenchi..."
>>
>>"Huh, where is Tenchi, I though I saw him when I woke up."
>>
>>The rivals face faulted.
>>
>>"Ummmm Lord Tenchi are you feeling well?" inquired Aeka.
>>
>>"Where is Tenchi?  And Ryoko, why are you addressing Tenchi as Lord
>>Tenchi...  I never heard you say that before?  Hmmmm..."
>>
>>"Tenchi? Are you ok, you are acting strange?" asked Ryoko.
>>
>>"Why do you keep calling me Tenchi!  My name is Mihoshi!  You got
>>that... M-I-H-O-S-H-I"
>>
>>Both Aeka and Ryoko looked strangely at the Tenchi that clamed to be
>>Mihoshi.  Something strange is happening.

Ranma: Gee, what was your first clue?!

>>
>>"Miyaaaa, Miya, Miya!  Miyaaaaaa, Miya, Miya!" a familiar voice sung.
>>
>>Everyone tuned their attention to what seemed like Sasami playing with
>>her hands and doing a little dance.  All the observers stared with
>>confusion.

Ryo-ok-hi: That's me! I'm a girl! (Washu looks strangely at Ryo-ok-hi.) Miyaa?
Can't I do work on my English?!
Washu: I just wish you'd be a cabbit that simply wanted carrots...

>>
>>Aeka inquired, "Are you ok Sasami?"
>>
>>The blue haired girl approached that cyan haired woman and started to
>>talk.
>>
>>"Miya Miya!"
>>
>>"Err... Sasami is that you?"  Aeka wondered?
>>
>>"Hah hah hah...  Don't you get it?" Ryoko laughed, "It is Ryo-ohki, I
>>can recognize what she is saying.  She thinks you are me..."

(Ryo-ok-hi puts on a swamii costume and holds up an envelope.)
Ryo-ok-hi: Miyaa! (Puts the envelope to her head.) Miyaa!
Washu: Ryo-ok-hi says, "Genma-panda with a machine gun after dinner." (She opens
up the envelope.) What eats, shoots and leaves?
Andrew: That was bad.

>>
>>A smiling cabbit enters behind the original occupant of its body.
>>
>>"Ahhh... so this must be my sister Sasami."  Aeka pointed to the
>cabbit.
>>
>>Sasami mentally says to Aeka, <Hello sister, what is happening?   I
>woke up in Ryo-ohki’s body.>  The princesses now have the mental link Ryoko
>>and Ryo-ohki used to shared.  It was fortunate that Aeka respected the
>>privacy of her sister, or Sasami’s fun could have ended a little
>shorter than expected.

Ryo-ok-hi: Miyaa. (Gives Washu a piece of paper.)
Washu: What's this?
Ryouga: I-i-it's the wedding party.
Izumi: But, Ryouga, I thought you were a LDPer.
Andrew: Izumi, it's not a political party.

>>
>>"What is the cause of this?"  Aeka wondered verbally.
>>
>>"MOM!!  It must be her doing!"  Ryoko shouted.

Washu: Oh, sure. Blame me.

>>                                                The pirate in a
>>princess's body started to walk downstairs.  An action in its self
>alien to Ryoko.  She had always phased up or down the stairs.
>>
>>The others followed suit.

Lina: Three of a kind!
Luna: Four of a kind!
A-ko: Gin!
Lina and Luna: GIN?!

>>
>>***
>>
>>Tenchi woke again from the shock he received from earlier this morning.
>>
>><It must have been a bad dream.  Yes!  A bad dream!> he thought to
>>himself as he attempted to get up.
>>
>>Tenchi opened his eyes and noticed in the refection of a nearby mirror
>>the tanned body that he was in.  He saw the curly yellow hair firmly
>>placed on his head.  Blood tricked down his nose as he gasped at
>>Mihoshi’s beautiful features, features that most men his age never gets
>>to see.  The young prince fainted again falling to the floor.

Ranma: Boy, is this going to be a looong day for Tenchi.
Washu: Yeah, I know. What entertainment! (Look at wedding list.) You want Mokona
to be the best man?!
Ryouga: Yeah, and we have Luna to be the Maid of Honor.
Washu: What?! An entire animal party?!
Ryo-ok-hi: Miyaa?
Washu: Why not?! Why not!! (She thinks for a moment.) I-I can't think of a
reason.

>>
>>***
>>
>>In front of the door to Washu's dimensional lab, what seemed to be a
>>ensemble of a cabbit, Tenchi, two princesses, and a space pirate gazed
>>at a note plastered on the door of the lab.

Akemi: And a partridge in a pear tree.
Luna (singing): ...Come on, get happy!
Lina (groaning): Please, sis, not the partridge family!!!

>>
>>  "Sorry, I am not in at the moment.  I am on another planet doing
>>  research and won't be back until tomorrow."
>>     --Washu, The greatest scientific genius in the universe

Everyone else: Yeah, right!
Washu: Hey! I have a right to have a title!

>>
>>The group was speechless.  A few seconds later, Ryoko broke the
>silence.
>>
>>"Damm!  On another planet my butt! I didn't see her leave at all!  This
>>isn't funny."
>>
>>"But, she had gone the day before.  Sasami said that she saw Washu
>leave for parts unknown yesterday.  And Sasami believes it wasn't Washu's
>>fault."  Aeka told the group.  She was being fed the information viva
>>their mental link.

Andrew: Sasami isn't a good liar.
A-ko: But Ayeka is pretty gullible.
Akemi: I don't know, this whole fic is sooo boring, I...I just wanna do
something else.

>>
>>"I still think she is still up to no good though.  It is just like her
>>to cause chaos with one of her inventions." replied Ryoko.
>>
>>"Miya miyya miiya Miya!  the blue haired girl said.
>>
>>Ryoko interpreted Ryo-ohki’s speech, "So you wee there also, hmmm....
>>Still I don't trust mom, she prob..."

Andrew: That reminds me, I'd better check on the coffee.
Washu (to Ryouga): You want her to wear this dress?!
Ryouga: She'll be in cabbit form, it'll be cute on her!
Washu: But I didn't design a cabbit to be wearing a dress! (Ryo-ok-hi point to
a part of the catalogue.) "Yes, we have cabbit-sizes too..."

>>"Hah ha ha ha ha ha!"

>>On a planet in another dimension away a scientist was monitoring the
>>days events evolve live.

A-ko: "Evolve live?" That doesn't make any sense.
Andrew: You'd think Ayeka would sprout wings or something.

>>                          Washu was watching with great interest on
>>several big screen monitors and the latest in stereo equipment that
>>would make anyone envious.  With a bag of popcorn in one had and a
>>remote control in the other, the red haired genius smiled.
>>
>>"Sasami, great plan!  I can't wait to see what happens next."

Washu: This is even better than CBS on Saturday nights!
Andrew: Or ABC on Friday nights, or NBC on Sunday nights, or Fox on most weekday
nights...
Washu: Yeah, I know. It's a good thing I have direct cable.

>>
>>Washu smile widened even more as she monitors the entrance of another
>>participant to the days events.
>>
>>"Ahh this will get very interesting."

Washu (with a german accent): ...but stupid.
Ranma: You're tell me?

>>
>>The door of the Masaki home opened revealing the Shinto priest of the
>>nearby shrine.  Yosho entered the house noticing the group of people
>>notably arguing in front of the closet.  Yosho sighed.  <This happens
>>all too frequently.> he thought to himself.
>>
>>"Tenchi!" Yosho yelled, "Get ready for practice later on today!"

Lina (imitating Yosho): We've got to get you ready for your first Sumo match!
Everyone else: Lina!

>>
>>The fighting stopped and everyone was looking at Yosho.
>>
>>Mihoshi Replied, "Tenchi?  I don't know where he is, may be in his
>>room."
>>
>>Yosho face faulted.  The half Juraian was surprised to see Tenchi say
>>that.  He even was more surpassed to see Sasami miyaing and what seemed
>>to be his sister pounding on the door to Washu's lab calling, "MOM!
>Let us in!"

Akemi: If I were Yosho, this would be a good time for a drink...
Lina: If you were anyone, this would be a good time for a drink, Akemi. Say,
aren't you suppose to be in a AA program?
Akemi: Yeah? I go to get travel tips all the time. (Lina lowers her head.) What?
Lina: That's AAA, not AA.
Akemi: You're treating me like a bond rating?! (The two girls start to argue.
Washu pulls a cord and both of them gets slammed by a huge 16 ton anvil.)

>>
>>"My brother, something terrible has happened!" Aeka cried, as she
>>wrapper her arms around him.

Luna (imitating Ayeka): I've decided to become a punk rocker!
A-ko: You know this fic is rather boring.

>>
>>The priest was totally shocked to see what seemed to be the space
>pirate hugging him.  He didn't know what to say at all as several seconds
>>passed.  Slowly Yosho realized what had seemed to happen.  Yosho
>decided to act with some hesitation in his voice.
>>
>>"Aeka, I think I understand what is the situation, but let us go to the
>>living room to discuss what has happened.  I need to understand what is
>>going on."

Andrew: I hope the priest isn't catholic. If he his, wait until the Pope hears
this...
Ranma: The Pope's Catholic? (Andrew groans.)

>>
>>With that, the entire group followed the priest into the living room.
>>There they made themselves comfortable.  The blue haired girl was
>eating carrots.  The rivals stared at each other, as the small cabbit smiled
>in between them.  The young man was almost falling asleep.
>>
>>Ryoko and Aeka filled Yosho in on the details on what was happening so
>>far.  After digesting this information Yosho then asked a simple
>>question.
>>
>>"Where is Tenchi, or should I say the body of Mihoshi?"

Andrew: He's lying dead in a pool of his own blood in a black and white bathtub,
with the shower's running!
Washu: You wish...

>>
>>Everyone shook their head in reply except for Mihoshi.  She had already
>>fallen asleep.
>>
>>"Hmmmm... I think we should go look for him..."  Yosho wondered
>>
>>Everyone nodded with agreement.
>>
>>"Then it is settled, Ill look in the house, Sasami check if he is
>around the space tree Funaho, Ryoko the carrot Field, Aeka the shine and
>>vicinity, Ryo-ohki the lake and it's vicinity, and Mihoshi will look in
>>the onsen if she ever wakes up."
>>
>>The group disperses on the lookout for the person in Mihoshi’s body.
>>Mihoshi just slept there.
>>
>>Yosho smiled.  He had sent the others on a wild goose chase.  It would
>>take the others some time to realize this.  The priest didn't want to
>>imagine the chaos if one of the other girls found his grandson first.
>>The priest knew that Tenchi would be still be in the house, and thus
>>retrieved Tenchi before the others could.

Keiichi: Oh, come on! He just wants to screw a 16-year-old kid, even if it's has
Tenchi's mind! (Everyone gets startled.)
Belldandy: Keiichi! How could you think such things!
Keiichi: I know how you and Skuld love to surprise a guy in the showers! (Skuld
and Belldandy blush. Urd gasp.)
Urd: Maybe my sisters have a libido after all.
Ranma: A libido...isn't that a raft? (Everyone face-faults again.)

>>
>>***
>>
>>"What happened?"
>>
>>A drowsy blond began to wake up.  This time in one of the guest
>bedrooms of the house.  There were two others in the room, his grandfather and
>>what seem to be his body drowsily playing with a pink cube.

Andrew: If that's what I think it is...
Washu: And it isn't...
Andrew: What did you think I thought it was, Washu?
Washu: A vibrator.
Andrew: I didn't think that was a vibrator.
Washu: Good. What did you think it was?
Andrew: A maxi-pad. (Washu face-faults.)

>>
>>The priest spoke, "Tenchi, are you ok?"
>>
>>"I think so... What happened?"
>>
>>Tenchi's grandfather thus explained the days events.  Although Tenchi
>>couldn't believe it, he was living proof that it actually happened.  For some reason he had switched bodies with
>>the first class detective.  As he contemplated the situation, Tenchi
>>noticed a chill in the air.  He wasn't wearing any cloths, despite
>those hentai readers wishes a blanket covered most of his body.

Ranma: Hentais?! Where?!
Ryouga (imitating Akane): You are, you pervert baka! (He slams Ranma with a
mallet.)
Ranma (weakly): Thanks, pal...(he starts to twitch.)
Ryouga: Hey, what are friends for?

>>
>>"Now you need dress in the right fashion, that is why I brought
>Mihoshi, she can help you get into one of her outfits.  I'll wait outside."
>>
>>Mihoshi giggled as Yosho departed the room, "It is time to play dress
>>up!"
>>
>>Tenchi screamed in shear horror!

Washu: Bwhahahahaha!!!
Andrew (flatly): Oh, the horror.

>>Author’s Afterward:  About character abilities, I assume that the
>>abilities of each character is based on the body.  The character may
>>have the ability to use the weapon, but not the knowledge to
>effectively use such power.  I hope you enjoyed this story.  C&C is really
>>appreciated.

Andrew: Okay, let's C&C. First I thought that there wasn't much action,
dialogue, or much of anything in this plot. It was really boring.
A-ko: Yeah. It would be nice if you could pick up the pace a bit. There are a
lot of places where you could have added a lot of detail.
Washu: Besides, why couldn't I get into the fun? Have me trade places with
someone?!
Andrew: You just wanna trade places with Tenchi.
Washu: well...
Ranma: I thought the paragraphs were too short. That's all.
Ryouga: So, Ryo-ok-hi, if we're gonna get married, do you think we oughta to go
to a conselor or something? Take a couple of blood tests?
Washu: I can do that. (He holds up a picture of a pink-haired girl getting DPed
by Daisuke and Hiroshi. Ryouga gets a bloody nose and Washu gets a sample of the
blood.
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa?
Washu: Yes, that's me...why did you...oh. (She blushes. Everyone else
face-faults.)

>>Thanks for reading!

Belldandy: And thank you for presenting it for us!
Urd: Yeah right.
Ryouga: Say, Urd, can I join you? I have this really bad urge to get really,
really drunk.
Urd: Why? You're marrying a pregnant cabbit as a pig...Oh. I see. Sure. (They
leave.)
Ryo-oh-ki: Miyaa! Miyaa! (The cabbit goes and follows them.)
Andrew: So, when the wedding?
Washu: I think that'll be in a couple of weeks...(She starts to cry. Andrew pats
her on the back.)
Izumi (feeling herself): Wait..there! I found my keys! Now I can unlock my
Patalabor...(there's a thud sound.)
A-ko: Oh, dear...
(Skuld looks outside.)
Skuld: Wai! You killed my Father! You bastard!
*******
Will Ryouga drink so much, he'll forget about Ryo-ok-hi? Ever want to see a
cabbit drunk? Is God really dead? Will Washu stop crying over spilled carrot
juice? Find out next time as we MST again on another Red-Head MST, the wedding,
part I!
