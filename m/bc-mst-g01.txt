	Tucked away in the heart of the American northwest, there is a town in 
Idaho called Boise. It's autumn in Boise right now, and the trees are proudly 
displaying their colors as the sun crests the Rocky Mountains. The shafts of 
light fall onto the Biscuit Commune, a two-story house on the edge of town. The 
people that live nearby don't call it the 'Biscuit Commune', though. They call 
it 'that place where those two dudes, the chick with the really big eyes and the 
giant electric cat live'.
	You see, there is a very strange story behind the Commune. Two friends, 
Marshall Leach and Brandon Rigby, once took a trip to Calumet City, Illinois. 
While they were there, they stumbled upon a secret government machine that could 
splice dimensions and realities. Unwittingly, the two activated the machine, 
releasing two characters from not-so-well-known anime videos into their world.
	Tora managed to eat seven people before he was calmed down. Aira was 
confused at first, but gradually began to cope.
	And now they live on the Commune, all under one roof, where they are paid 
to critique anime fanfiction. They have a lush and illustrious history...and 
today they move into the world of Tenchi Muyo!.

	The sun streaming in the window felt like it would burn Marshall's 
eyeballs into oblivion as he suddenly slid his eyelids back and drank in the 
full image of his room at morning. The few articles of clothing here and there. 
The poster of Jake and Elwood Blues. The postcard from Brandon Rigby, who was on 
his Mission in Italy. The piles and piles of manga stacked neatly on a 
bookshelf, and a half-empty bag of chips, remnants of a group game of 'Risk' the 
Biscuit Commune had been playing the night before.
	He felt like he had a hangover. Too much soda, he surmised as he fumbled 
for his glasses. He hopped out of bed, stripped out of his pajamas and jerked on 
a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt before pushing the door to his room open and 
stepping out into the hall.
	He was almost immediately run over by Tora, the great Tiger Demon, who was 
chasing an 
enormous catnip mouse at least the size of his head. Marshall scratched his 
cheek, looking rather confused as the large yellow demon vanished down the 
stairs. 
	"What a way to start the morning," He said, then turned around to shout 
down the hallway. "Hey, Todd! Get your butt out of bed! Aira! Wakey-wakey!"
	Two doors were slid open, and two very angry sets of eyes were directed 
towards The Biscuit. Aira, wearing her silver hair in a ponytail, stumbled out 
of her room and moved over to his side. She hung off his shoulder, gazing 
directly up at him with irritated, tired eyes. 
	"It's too early for this, Marshall," She whined.
	"Come on, guys. I'll make us some coffee before we head down into the 
theater."
	They shuddered collectively. Another fic had come in the night before, 
just before Brandon took off for Rome. Once more, it was up to the Biscuit 
Commune to put bad fics in their place. But that didn't mean they had to enjoy 
it.
	"It had better be 'Hairy Knockers' coffee, Marsh," Todd trudged down the 
hall, jerking a black muscle shirt on. "The stronger, the better."
	"Look at it this way," Marshall pressed, helping Aira to right herself. 
"We get paid for it."
	"Which reminds me," Tora had flown slowly up the stairs, holding a 
scratched catnip mouse in his claws. "Where does the money come from?"
	"Somewhere in Calumet City, I think. But we get by, right? You know what 
they say..."
	"Yep," Todd stretched. "Just scratch yourself and walk away."
	After saying this, the young man gave his privates a liberal scratching 
and moved off down the hall. 
	"I hate it when he does that," Aira looked sick, and also moved off 
towards the stairs. 
	"Let's eat," Tora slid down the banister, leaving Marshall alone in the 
hallway.
	"Mondays," He whispered with a tired sigh.

*		*		*		*		*		*	

	"Y'know, it's scientifically proven that men who have sex last longer than 
men who don't," Todd walked by Marshall, tossing an egg behind his back. The 
taller one caught the egg, cracked it, and dumped it into a bowl that rested on 
the counter. "Kinda makes you wonder."
	"Looks like you two will be living very short lives," Aira said with an 
evil grin as she buttered four pairs of toast. "Geeks never get a piece."
	"While we're on the subject of useless trivia," Tora was roasting long 
slices of bacon on the stove, filling the room with the aroma of cooking pig. 
"Did you know that if you're caught in a lighting storm, you should drop down 
and stick your butt in the air?"
	"He's right," Marshall took his odd mix to the oven next to Tora and 
poured it into a pan. "If you're going to be hit, that's the safest orifice."
	"Kinda makes you wonder," Todd mumbled again.
	"But the comment about never getting a piece was cruel, Aira."
	She grinned, sticking her tongue out. "I know."
	They ate with hearty conversation tossed back and forth. Once the meal was 
halfway over, 
Marshall looked at his watch.
	"Dammit," He swore. "Ten to seven. We'd better get into the theater and 
get this over with."
	"I'll get the coffee," Todd rose from his chair. 
	"I'll stock the barf bags," Tora added with a sarcastic grin.
	The group of intrepid MSTers rose from their seats, exchanged a look of 
fear, and opened the door under the stairs that led to the cellar which had been 
converted into a theater.

non-human on the compound, but if he cares, he isn't showing it.

Marshall: Okay...let's hope this one isn't going to be bad.

>disclaimer : i don't own any part of Tenchi Muyo and
>i just write about it so don't sue me.

	Tora: It's going to be bad.
	Aira: Ooooooh yeah.

	All: ...<awed silence>
	Todd: Was that entire hodgepodge one sentence?
	Tora: No capitalization, no comma usage.dear lord, what have we gotten 
ourselves into?


>		  **A Stroll Through Hell**

	    Marshall: Oh, how nice. A stroll through hell. After that we can take 
a rowboat 	across the river Styx, maybe have a picnic in Purgatory.
	Aira: Don't forget. I have to visit Satan and get my Weed Whacker back.

	Todd: Is skydiving really worth it? The fees, but the thrills!

> Should or not? Should or not

	Tora: That's what we want to know.

> Should I marry one of the six women in this house 
>and make them eternally happy

	Aira: Wait.by my calculations, he's including Sasami. You don't 
suppose...this is going 	to be a Lemon, do you?
	Marshall: Please. Have a LITTLE respect. I wouldn't go that far.
	Tora: But what about all that hentai manga stuffed under your bed? 
    Todd: And how would YOU know about that, Tora?
	Tora: Erk...um...<Blushes>
	Todd: That's what I thought.
	
> or continue to put them 
> through the stress and terror of not being my wife.

	Aira: Oh! We're back. I'd almost forgotten about the fic.
	Marshall: Isn't Tenchi overreacting a little? I mean, is it 'terror' not 
being married to 	him?
	Tora: I'm not exactly horrified, myself.

	Marshall: He 'nocks' out, does he? Is that some hippy-raver-budgie lingo 
for taking a 	hit? 
	Tora: <As Tenchi> Dude...I nocked out today, it was so great.

> or not getting enough blood to my brain. 
> The only reason I didn't do that when I was with Haruana was

	Todd: Traces can cure nosebleeds? Woo-Hoo! I'm there!
	Aira: I think he means 'trance'. And please, if anybody makes a Final 
Fantasy IX joke, 		I'll fry them.
	Marshall: Whoa. Angst.
	Aira: It's healthy.

	Marshall: If this isn't a blatant bugle of foreshadowing, I don't know 
what is.
 
> But in any case here are my traits (boy I feel silly talking to 
> myself as if I was talking to a rock)

	Todd: Okay, Me, here's the low-down.
	Tora: How does one attribute talking to oneself to talking to a rock?
	Aira: Must be midnight. He's gonna let it all hang down.
	Marshall: Um...ew...

> 1: loyalty that may help

	Tora: This has just turned into both stream of consciousness and a pity 
party.
	Marshall: And we get the distinct displeasure of viewing Tenchi's moral 
dilemma.

> One you

	Marshall: I think he means 'demonic duo', to coin a phrase.
	Todd: Doesn't the TMFFA have a quality filter?
	Aira: This must have slipped in early.

	Marshall: What?

	Tora: Yeah. Girls that battle for your love day in and day out are REALLY 
like family, 	Tenchi.
	Todd: Maybe he moved to Alabama...?

> .........    ............ ....... ....
> .... ... ......... hmmmmm. Uuuuuuhuuuu. Mmmmm. Well that's it

	Marshall: I refuse to listen to this! I refuse! I'm under eighteen!
	Todd: <As Tenchi> Oh, yeah...well, that's it...haaaauuuuuuuh... 

> I've figured it out! They feel too much like family and

	Tora: Big pay-off there. If you can't see this one coming, you need to be 
hit in the face 	with a slab of beef.
	Todd: He made that decision rather quickly, didn't he?

	Marshall: Whoa...too much info...

>Tenchi: huuuuuh (said in a sigh like form)

	Todd: Well, he's still going at it with the funny noises.
	Tora: <Japanese old man laugh> Ush-sha-sha-sha-sha.

>Sasami: Tenchi, is there something wrong?

	Marshall: <As Tenchi> Well...I've been thinking about my Wang.
	Aira: Oh, no.
	Marshall: <Still as Tenchi> No, seriously! My Wang has growth potential!
	Tora: No more Penny Arcade jokes, either.

>Tenchi: well in fact I do have something on my mind but what I was

>Aeka: Tenchi I'm sure we can handle it.

>Tenchi: well if you say so Aeka

	Todd: <As Tenchi> To be truthful...I hate you all.

>... well I've decided to go to college

	Aira: RICHARD NIXON!

>Ryoko: (gloomps Tenchi) oh Tenchi I'm so happy you finally decided to

	Todd: <Whimpers> Punctuation? ANYBODY?

>Aeka: (smashes a stick on Ryoko's head) please Tenchi continue.

	Marshall: Yes, the stick she had been carrying around strapped to her 
back. Or maybe she 	had it on her leg and would just whip it out to deal 
some mighty damage.
	Tora: Heh...Ayeka would whip out her stick, huh? 
	Marshall: THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT!

>Tenchi: well as I was say that woman is Kiyone (Tenchi reaches out and 
>grabs her hand)

>Aeka / Ryoko: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU PICK HER OVER ME YOUR KIDDING ME RIGHT!

	Tora: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU HAVE NO FRIED RICE?

>Kiyone: what? Who? Me? (blushing brightly)

	Aira: No. The Kiyone standing behind you.

>Mioshi: OOOOHHH KIYONE I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU YYYEEEAAAAHH!

	All: BOO-YAH!

>Sasami: oh... oh my... oh well. (I feel sick but...)Ki... Kiyone I'm

	Marshall: And I'm stronger. If I can put up with Aira on a Sunday morning, 
Ryoko and 		Ayeka would be a snap.
	Aira: Oh, I'm sorry. Did you say something, Marshall? 
	Marshall: Erk...uh...no, ma'am.

	Marshall: Okay, everyone...gather 'round and hear the tale. Anybody happen 
to remember 	the old wives' tale about buttered toast?
	Tora: Um.it always lands butter-side down?
	Marshall: Very good, my furry companion...however, what if you were to 
	somehow...'confuse' the toast? 
	Aira: How?
	Marshall: Butter both sides! Now, if a piece of double-sided buttered 
toast (hereafter 	referred to as the DSBT) is left in the air, it will spin 
continuously with no stopping 	unless by an outside force.

> Kiko: Don't we all?

> Tenchi: Huh, oh welcome to Misaki Shrine the keeper is not here right now but 
> any problems or confessions that you want to explain I am well enough to 
handle 
> and help; is there any thing you need.

	Todd: Where are you going with this?
	Marshall: <making hand gestures to prove his point> I'm getting there, 
Todd. Now, if the 
	DSBT is traveling at 40 mph (the Speed of Toast) and is charged with 3017 
Jules of 	energy, the rapid speed and centrifugal force of the spinning DSBT 
will cause the butter 	to fly off and invert itself while the toasted bread 
creates a hole in reality.
	Tora: Good God...this is amazing. I never thought that in my wildest 
dreams... 

> Kiko: no thank you but is there an area where I can get some water?

> Tenchi: it's over there (points to faucet in the small shrine) would you like 
> specially prepared tea instead.

> Kiko: of course if you'd take the time, please?

> Tenchi: hold on. 

	Marshall: I'm not even to the best part. Using this DSBT energy, the hole 
in reality can 	gain enough force and power to pull the world into it, or at 
least warp time and space in 	subtle ways.
	Todd: For example?
	Marshall: Two towns in Nevada...I can't remember the names...but from Town 
A to Town B 
	it's 12 miles, but from Town B to Town A...it's only eight.
	Aira: Wow! What if the toast was in a car?
	Marshall: That's what I call the 'Toast Carriage Conversion Factor' 
(TCCF). Due to the 	added weight and shape of a car, it would have to travel 
at over 12,000,000,000 mph to 	simulate the Speed of Toast.

	Aira: Damn! He's right!

	Marshall: That's...um...Japanese for 'cough'?

> Kiko: thank you.

> Tenchi: no problem (continues to sweep the ground)

> Aeka: give me it back!

	Tora: I paid eight bucks for that vibra-...
	Aira: <Begins beating Tora with a ripped-up theater seat> Keep quiet, fuzz 
ball!
	Todd: Whoa...

> Ryoko: no ya little stuck up!

> Aeka: it is for Tenchi and not meant to be wrecked by you!!!

	Todd: All your base are belong to us!
	Marshall: You have no chance to survive make your time!
	Aira: Crafted with pride in the lumpy gravy!
	Tora: We can't born to be my power!

> Ryoko: (flies up into the air) aright then catch! (Ryoko takes the present and

	Todd: She seemed to gauge it so it landed EXACTLY half a mile away.

> Aeka: That was for Tenchi, oh you!

> Ryoko: Tenchi would never want you!

> Aeka: we will see about that just let me give him his present, yes then we 
will see

	Marshall: She's being a little redundant, isn't she?

> Ryoko: yeah if ya get to it!

	Tora: My god! Commas! Grammar! Spelling! PLEASE!
 
> Tenchi: (puts his face in his hands) my god don't they ever stop.

> Kiko: fans of yours.

> Tenchi: burdens more the word.

	Aira: Beast of Burden, maybe. I'd like to see Ryoko and Ayeka with boxes 
strapped to 		their backs.

> Kiko: heh heh heh, hey I'm going to college too maybe will see each other.

	Marshall: And, of course, by the random miracles of fanfiction, they'll be 
placed in the 	same college.
	Tora: In the same, wing, the same classes, the same dorm.
	

> Tenchi: why are you out here then.
> Kiko: well I had some time and wanted to get free of it all.

> Tenchi: you choose the right place.

> Kiko: I'm glad... ..... ..... ... your cute.

> Tenchi: WHAT?!

	Aira: <as Kiko> I said you're cute. Get over it. Jeez, you act like you 
hear it every day 	from attractive alien women or something.
	Todd: Heh...what are the chances of THAT happening?

> Kiko: it's not bad.

> Tenchi: you right, it's not bad but you got keep it down.

	Marshall: You right, foo. I pity da foo who don't eat his greens. Or 
something.
	Tora: What I wouldn't give for Kimono No Yari right now.
	Aira: Kimono No Yari? What's that?
	Tora: The Beast Spear. Ushio has it right now. It was made for killing 
monsters, and this 	fic is something of a monstrosity, so...
	Todd: I see where you're going with this, Tora, but aren't you a monster?
	Tora: Todd...sometimes a tiger demon has to take a stand.	

> Kiko: what do you mean?

> Tenchi: I'm talking about those two over there.

> Kiko: your devoted fans.

	Marshall: She doesn't seem to be too surprised that Ryoko just flew bodily 
into the air 	and threw a package exactly half a mile away.

> Tenchi: yes those people, they'll kill you if they hear a comment like that. 
Heck  
> if they see you here having a conversation with me they'll interrogate you.

	Aira: <as Ryoko> Where were you on the night of December 7th, 1982?
	Tora: <as Kiko> Uh...I was...at the pornography store...buying 
pornography.

> Kiko: (a smile cover her face) you would stop them (winks) wouldn't you?

	Todd: Whoa! There's something covering her face! She needs to breathe! Get 
the Jaws of 		Life! Pepper spray! A really sharp knife! Mountain Dew! 
Anything to eat through that 		smile!

> Tenchi: I could try but there are two of them... (stops sweeping) well I'm 
done.

> Kiyko: huh, oh well I'm done here, I've got to go.

> Tenchi: its not usual that we get people like you here please come again.

> Kiko: here's something to remember me by. (gives him a flirting smile)

	Todd: <as Tenchi> Augh! If they see you smiling at me like that, they'll 
kill you! 
	Marshall: <as Tenchi> No! My nose is bleeding all over the place!
	Aira: <as Tenchi-falls out of her chair and hits the ground in a faint>
	Tora: C'mon, you guys are overreacting.
	Marshall: I know, but its so fun!
	Tora: <as Tenchi> Why does this always have to happen to me? <falls next 
to Aira> Damn, 
	man. This is fun.

> Kiko stands up turns to Tenchi bows to him and leaves. Tenchi stands up looks 
> around and starts back home.

   
>		      *INTERMISSION*

	Tora: <getting back into his seat> Do we actually get an intermission this 
time?
	Marshall: We're taking one. Okay, everybody, out of your seats. It's time 
for a little 	break.

*		*		*		*		*

	Marshall blew out a sigh as he opened the door to the basement, slumping 
out into the hallway and pressing himself against the wall. He felt like his 
legs were made of rubber, and he suddenly felt as if he wanted to sleep. Aira 
stretched as she moved out behind him, yawning. Tora and Todd glanced at each 
other as they exited.
	"What do you say to a rousing game of Silent Hill?" Todd asked with a wide 
grin. 
	Tora grinned in return, showing off his sharp, pearly fangs. "I'm in," He 
said, then after a slight pause. "It doesn't have any samurai in it, does it?"
	"Uh...no..."
	"Oh. Okay, then I'm in!"
	The two raced into the kitchen and jammed a bowl of popcorn into the 
microwave. Tora 
perched on the back of a chair while Todd sat on the edge of the counter. 
Marshall leaned in the 
doorjamb, adjusting his glasses and heaving another sigh.
	"Something wrong?" Aira asked with a toss of her silver hair. She smiled 
winsomely as she 
approached. "You look a little down, Marsh."
	"Shouldn't you be?" He asked with a bit of a grumble. "Bad fanfiction in 
the basement, a 
heaping pile of breakfast dishes...man, this day is going horribly."
	"Come on," She tugged at his hand and began leading him towards the 
stairs. 
	They ascended the flight and crossed down the hall to the door that led to 
the attic. Aira led him up into the musty-smelling attic and to a window that 
opened up onto the gentle slope of a roof tier. She stepped out into the cool, 
crisp air and spread her arms to the wind. 
	"Isn't it nice up here?" She asked as Marshall stepped out onto the roof. 
"Take a look at the scenery."
	He did. And it certainly was beautiful. The trees of Boise, Idaho were 
showing their full 
autumn foliage, and the birds seemed joyful as they darted back and forth in the 
afternoon sunlight. Aira's warm fingers slid towards his, intertwining and 
pulling him closer. He spun on his heel and faced her with a confused look on 
his face.
	"Aira..."
	"Shh..." She whispered softly, taking the front of his t-shirt in both 
hands. She licked her lips with what seemed to be a feral sort of hunger, 
something he had never seen from her before. She stretched up on her tiptoes, 
moving her lips towards his. "This is our moment."
	"HEY! GUYS!"
	Marshall jumped in surprise, loosing his foothold on the roof. He stumbled 
back and rolled down the slope of the roof, bouncing once before he plummeted 
down a full two stories to land on the grass below. A loud thump wound its way 
up to Aira's ears.
	"Oooh..." Marshall groaned from below. "My hip...my hip."
	"Hey," Tora poked his head out the attic window, scratching his cheek with 
one claw. "Where did Marsh go?"
	"Oh, my God," Aira knelt at the edge of the roof, watching the splayed-out 
form of Marshall lying there groaning. Tora watched as well, his eyes white and 
round. 
	"Well, that sucks," He said in his growling voice. "I'd better go down and 
help him."
	As Tora floated gently to the ground, Todd made his way out the window and 
stood next to 
Aira, jamming his hands in his pockets. Together, they watched as Tora set his 
claws upon Marshall.
	"Just lay back. I've seen chiropractors do this on TV."
	"OW! Dammit, Tora! Get your claws offa me!"
	"C'mon, you weenie! You're in good paws!"
	"Listen, fuzzball...you touch me there, I'll shove my foot up your fluffy 
ass!"
	"Hey! It is NOT fluffy!"
	"Ouch! That's it, you giant, hairy hemorrhoid, I'm getting up and I'm 
gonna..."
	Todd blew out a soft sigh and turned around. "Let's get back into the 
theater. This hiatus of ours didn't do us any good at all."
	"I think you're right." Aira watched Marshall, grumbled a little, and 
followed Todd through the window.

>		**A Stroll Through Hell**
>		 Part 1, act 3 The Chase.

	<Todd, Tora, Marshall and Aira enter the theater in that order. Marshall 
glares an evil 	glare at Tora>
	Tora: What?
	Marshall: YOU know what, fuzzy. I won't hold back next time.
	Tora: Be reasonable. You don't have a magic weapon, and you're not a 
demon. You couldn't 
	take me on if you tried.
	Marshall: Damned...fluffy...bastard...

> Kiyone: hmm I wonder what it would be like to be with him, oh but that's silly 
> he'll find somebody he likes, oh but what if it is me?

> Ryoko: I don't think you'll find out (creates beam sword) but for your sake 
I'll 
> tell you the answers to your questions he'll find somebody else, me, not you 
and 
> my life will be prefect with him with me. (Brings the sword up to her neck)

	Marshall: All your base are.aw, forget it.
	Todd: Oh, give me a break. Ryoko would respect any decision Tenchi makes 
simply because 
	she loves him so much. She wouldn't fly into a murderous rage like this.
	Tora: Aren't you nitpicking a little?
	Todd: Well, yeah, but...so?

> Kiyone: (use's shield to nock the sword away) all right, attempt on a 
civilian's 
> life plus attempt on officer's life lets see who this goes over with the 
people  
> back at G.P.

	Tora: <Shaking his head> Okay...what civilian did she assault...and where 
did Kiyone get 	a shield?
	Aira: Damned if I know, Tora...damned if I know. 

> Ryoko: (pulls the sword up) the people at G.P. don't have to know, it will be 
> just between me and your carcass.

	Marshall: <as Ryoko> And believe me...me and your carcass have a LOT of 
catching up to 		do! Mua ha ha ha!
	Todd: <as Kiyone> That...just sounded stupid.
	Marshall: <as Ryoko> Well...uh...I didn't have much time, I did the best I 
could!	

> Kiyone: (socks Ryoko in the stomach and runs) you'll have to get me first!

	Aira: Hit an' run, Kiyone! 
	Marshall: <takes off his sock and beats Tora with it> Look! I'm socking 
Tora! And now I'm 
	running! <Dashes for the exit, but Aira quickly subdues him>
	Aira: <dragging him back to his seat>  No way, Biscuit. You're not getting 
away before we 	do.
 
>Ryoko: Damn!... she hits hard but she doing exactly as planed. (Drops to the 
> ground and disappears)

> Kiyone runs by millions of trees as she searches for Tenchi.

	Todd: I wonder if the author actually realizes how many trees 'a million' 
really is.
	Tora: <as Kiyone> Huff...puff...damn! I've been running for almost three 
days now!

> Kiyone: damn it!!! Where's Tenchi when you need him. (goes up the stairs and 
falls 
> to her knees by accident)

> Aeka: hey! Kiyone!

> Kiyone: (turns her head to see Aeka in the bushes) huh, oh, Aeka you have got 
> to help me.

	Aira: <as Kiyone> But first...what are you doing in the bushes?
	Marshall: <as Ayeka> Um...masturba-<Aira beats him with a theater seat> 
Ow! Ow! Okay, 
	okay, I was picking flowers.

> Aeka: its Ryoko isn't it but don't worry come on.

> Tenchi walks towards the house when Ryoko flies out sword in hand.

> Ryoko: KIYONE!!! COME OUT!!! (Ryoko flies away)  

> Tenchi: holy shit! I knew it!
> (follows Ryoko to where ever Kiyone was)

	Tora: Sounds like not even the author knows where that is.
	Todd: Did TENCHI just say the word 'shit'? That's like...the president 
swearing on public 
	access television. It just...doesn't happen. That would be like...Marshall 
getting a 		date.
	Marshall: Hey! 
	Todd: "Hey is for Horses", bud.
	Marshall: Jerk.
 
> Aeka: look over there. (points to the right)

> Kiyone: (looks in the direction pointed out) what I, don't see it?

> Aeka: look closer.

> When Kiyone is not looking Aeka hits her with a stick and drags her off.

	Tora: Is this the same stick that Ayeka 'whipped out' before?
	Marshall: You're cruisin' for a bruisin', fluffy.

> Ryoko: HUH, oh great you got her meet you in the cave. (disappears)
> Tenchi: damn it lost her. Hmm, oh the cave huh, will just see who is behind 
this 
> (Tenchi runs, jumps off the tree limb and heads towards the cave.)

	Aira: When was Tenchi in a tree?
	Tora: Does he ever travel by tree branches?

>			~Two minutes later, in the cave~
> Kiyone: huh? What... what happen? Oh, my head hurts. Aeka. Where are you? 
> (Opens eyes) what the  hell am I doing inside Ryoko's cave? 

	Aira: RICHARD NIXON!
	<All three of the other MSTers watch her with odd gazes. An awkward 
silence ensues.>
	Marshall: ...
	Todd: ...
	Tora: ...
	Marshall: Aira...please, answer me this one simple question...WHY did you 
just shout 
	'Richard Nixon'?
	Aira: Come on, I said it earlier. Besides, think about it. Watergate is 
WAY more 		interesting than this fic could ever be.
	Todd: I could never get into my American Government class, but I'd say she 
has a point.
	Tora: What's 'Watergate'?

> Aeka: it's a pitiful thing to lower myself to this but I won't allow you to 
have 
> Tenchi.

> Kiyone: WHAT!?!? 

> Ryoko: you played it out perfectly.

> Kiyone: What do you mean played it out perfectly. 
> (notice's she restrained to the wall when she tries punch and run again.)

	Aira: C'mon, Kiyone! Punch 'er in the boob!
	<Once again, the MSTers fix Aira with confused looks and awkward silence.>
	Marshall: Aira...that makes two.	
	Aira: <innocently> What?

> Ryoko: you pack a wallop in that fists. 

	Tora: 'That fists'? 
	Marshall: Tora...please. It's almost finished.

>But to answer your question; me and Aeka 
> planed this out  Aeka looks to  up-right to do a thing like this and if I 
scared you 
> well enough you'd go looking  for Tenchi, but if you found Aeka we knew you 
would ask 
> her to help might help. Then when you'd  leas expect it she'd hit you over the 
head 
> and drag you off to here.

	Marshall: <as Kiyone> Before you kill me, will you at least tell me your 
plan? In great 	detail, please, for Tenchi behind that rock over there.
	Aira: <as Ryoko> Oh, okay...well, anyway.

> Aeka: we knew that if you had "left" Tenchi would pick another and Ryoko and I 
where 
> determined  to chose one of us.

> Kiyone: this is not going to be good to your heath Aeka you know how Jurai 
deals with 
> traitorous  acts as for you Ryoko G.P. is going to be pissed of when they hear 
what you 
> did and you could be locked up for along time or until Nagi finds you.

> Aeka / Ryoko: Who's going to know?

	Marshall: Uh..the GP, for one.

> Kiyone: G.P., when I don't come to the monthly report.

> Aeka: I could tell them that you were K.I.A. during a mission in your earth 
job.

	Aira: The sheer illogical nature of their plan is mind-boggling. First of 
all, who says 	she's on a mission? It would have to be confirmed with 
headquarters first. Second of all, 	where would they hide the body?
	Todd: Third of all...are we at the end yet?

> Kiyone: Mioshi?

> Ryoko: HAH! Well say the same thing to her except that this time we'll also 
say that 
> you were  the only one to be assigned to the job, she's such a bumble head 
she'll fall 
> for it.

	All: <Whispering amongst themselves>
	Marshall: All right...and a-one, and a-two, and a-three...
	Aira: <as John Lee Hooker> Boom, boom, boom, boom...gonna shoot 'ya right 
down...
	Tora: <same> Get offa your feet...take 'ya home with me...
	Todd: <same> Put 'ya in my house...boom, boom, boom, boom...
	Marshall: <same> A-howa-howa-howa-howa...mmm-hmm...
	All: <same> Yaaaaay-heeeeeey!

> Kiyone: ("their probably right", her eyes get wide)
> Tenchi!!!

	Aira: I think we've all pretty much given up on any hope of correct 
spelling or context 	by now, haven't we, fellas?

> Aeka / Ryoko: we done enough training to trick him into believing us. 

> Tenchi: (walks out of the corner he was hiding in) Yeah, well I think I've 
heard enough 
> of this  junk to last me the entire time!

	Marshall: Poof! And there he is! Just happened to hide out and hang around 
instead of 
	immediately jumping to Kiyone's rescue. That's our Tenchi.

> Aeka / Ryoko: huh, Tenchi?!

> Kiyone: (struggles to get free) oh yeah, now your in for it!

	Todd: <as a G-Dawg...or whatever> Awww, ye-yeah, bizzatch! Now y'all in 
fo' it, mutha 
	fuggas!

> Tenchi: PLEASE, TELL ME THE LOGIC IN KILLING KIYONE!!!

	Tora: <as Ayeka> Actually...as this chart shows, killing Kiyone will bring 
about a cosmic 	shift that will prevent the deaths of millions.
	Marshall: <as Tenchi> Oh...well, then. Carry on.

> Aeka: oh dear.

> Ryoko: umm... well... uh hmm... TENCHI YOU MUST MARRY ME OR... OR......

	Aira: is this how Ryoko gets out of tense situations? Is this what she 
does when she gets 
	nervous? Yells at people and orders them around?
	Marshall: <as Tenchi> Ryoko! What are you doing with my dad...naked?
	Tora: <as Ryoko> Uhh...well...uh hmm...TENCHI, YOU MUST MAKE ME A 
	SANDWICH...OR...OR...

> Tenchi: or what Ryoko, you'll kill Kiyone and make me hate you! Is that what 
you 
> want?! Do you  want me to despise you for what you did?! Well you haven't done 
it 
> yet but you're about to! I  really don't like you right now don't try me any 
further!

	Aira: <as Tenchi> I...really don't like you! 
You...stupid...stinkybuttpoophead!
	Todd: <as Ryoko> Uh...boo-hoo? Fiddlesticks?

> Aeka: but ten... (is cut off by Tenchi)

> Tenchi: and you Aeka, your royalty, what the hell do you think your doing! 
Ryoko 
> doing this,   well I must say I'm little not surprised but you... you of all 
> people! Jeez, I mean come on I'm  starting to think all that royalty is making 
you 
> greedy!

> Aeka: oh, Tenchi! I'm sorry.

> Tenchi: sorry is not going to cut you and Ryoko have been causing havoc for 
the last 
> 5 years! Do  you know how high strung I am with all of that! and now this?!?!? 
> Please show me the logic in this, please?!

	Todd: <as Ayeka> Didn't I show you the chart? Here, take a look at this.
	Marshall: <as Tenchi> Oh, yeah...forgot about that...carry on.

> Ryoko: sorry, I'm very sorry (floats away)

> Aeka: I shall see what happens to me in court. No more will I stay here I, 
> promise that. (with   that she runs away.

	Tora: She's being a little poetic, isn't she? "No more will I stay here!"
	Marshall: Aren't you being a little harsh?

> Kiyone: Tenchi help me! (struggles more)

> Tenchi: hold on Kiyone.

> Tenchi runs over to Kiyone to unlock her from the wall but finds he needs a 
key.

	Marshall: <as Tenchi> Damn! I need to go through the dungeon and find the 
Blue Key! 	Stupid RPG rules!

> Tenchi: Damn it! Need a key. Stay very still Kiyone.

>Kiyone: ok.

> Tenchi creates one light hawk wing. He changes it to look like an exacto knife 
> grabs it and slowly cuts the chain. Kiyone falls from the wall onto Tenchi and 
kisses 
> him. 

	Aira: <scoffs> Tch...an 'Exact-O' knife? Come ON. That doesn't even 
deserve a joke!
	Tora: And somehow, Tenchi's 'nosebleed factor' doesn't add up when it 
comes to making out 
	with Kiyone.

> Kiyone: Oh Tenchi! You saved me, but what about those two. (Hugs him tightly)

	Todd: Question mark.

> Tenchi: I don't know Kiyone, I just don't know.

>	       ~Twenty minutes later, Tenchi's bed room~ 

> Kiyone rests her head on Tenchi's chest.

> Kiyone: good night.

> Tenchi: good night

	Marshall: Ladies and gentlemen, the shortest sex scene in history!
	Aira: As hot as the arctic!
	Tora: As sexy as a pair of wet sweatpants!
	Todd: Steamy as...uh...Richard...Nixon?
	Aira: That's MY joke, you can't have it.

>			End of part 1

> Next time: well its time for Tenchi to go to college to get away from it all 
but what
> is "she"  doing there. I'm sure you know who "she" is.

	Marshall: C'mon, gang. Let's get the HELL out of here.
	Aira: <as Nixon> I am not a crook! 
	Tora: Aira...just shut up.
	Todd: I like pie.
	<The MSTers stand and exit the basement theater>

*		*		*		*		*	

	"Y'know, guys," Marshall said as he went over the budget about an hour 
later at the kitchen table. "We have enough loose cash to buy enough tickets so 
we can sell out a theater for a movie."
	Todd was concocting Oreo milkshakes not too far away. "Why would we want 
to do that?" He 
asked, adding ice cream to his brew. "I mean...there are only four of us. Why 
would we want to buy every single ticket for a single movie?"
	"One word, Todd: Tora. Do you really think anyone is going to just sit 
around and watch a 
movie with a four-hundred pound tiger demon sitting next to them? We'd all be 
gunned down by cops and the local militia. That, or he would eat everyone in the 
audience."
	"I see what you mean."
	Aira swirled in wearing a red evening dress and high heels, taking a saucy 
pose in the doorway and spreading her arms. 
	"How do I look?" She asked with a purring lilt to her voice. "Good?"
	"Very nice," Marshall replied with a blush, fumbling with his glasses. 
"But what's the 
occasion?"
	"I don't know," She responded, shrugging and making a catwalk stride 
towards the table, 
which she sat upon with an arched back. "Just felt like dressing up."
	Todd grinned as he poured the milkshake into four cups.
	"Guys," He said. "I have an idea."

*		*		*		*		*

	Later that night, the four of them made their way into the otherwise empty 
theater, all of them dressed their best. Aira wore her red evening dress and 
wound her arm with Marshall's, who was wearing a pair of jeans, a black 
turtleneck and a sports coat, casually classy. Todd followed close behind 
wearing a tuxedo, and Tora looked like a 6'8'' furry yellow feline Chippendale's 
Dancer, clad only in an odd-shaped pair of pants specifically tailored to his 
unique body structure, and a bow tie.
	"Dressing up like this was a good idea," Tora said with a pleased smile. 
"I feel all.neat and clean."
	"You were combing your fur not twenty minutes ago," Todd pointed out.
	Aira giggled. "It's amazing we managed to fit you into the car at all," 
She said. "For a minute there, I thought we would need a plunger or a crowbar."
	Marshall just smiled as they took seats in the middle row. Aira leaned 
against him, and he wound his arm around her shoulders. The picture began, 
flickering across the screen.
	It was Excalibur...possibly the worst movie ever made.
	Well...it was certainly better than Tenchi fanfiction.
