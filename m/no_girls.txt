No Girls
  By Octavia "Pretty Girl" Bogan (Nbogan1023@aol.com)

Ayeka is too prisssy
And Ryoko tries to seduce me
Mihoshi is a crazy clutz
And Washu is a science nut so

No I don't want Ayeka
No I don't want Ryoko
No I don't want Washu
No I don't want Mihoshi no

(Chorus)
I don't want no girls Ayeka, Ryoko,Washu, Sasami
I be hearin' boom they fightin' in my room tryin' to get wit me
I don't want no girls Kiyone, Sakuya, Haruna, Mihoshi
I be hearin' boom they fightin' in my room tryin' to get wit me

Does anybody like Sakuya? NO
Haruna used to go wit Yosho
Sasami is to young for me
And Kiyone, come on, seriously

(repeat chorus)

Ya'll all are aliens
(O yes girls I'm talkin to ya'll)
Ya'll jackin' up my house
(O yes girls I talkin' to ya'll)
Ya'll makin' me wanna turn gay
(O yes girls I'm talkin' to ya'll)
Ya'll wanna get wit me but dat can't be ooo nooo I don't want noooooooo

Nooooooooo Girrrrrrrrrrls
Nooooooooo Girrrrrrrrrrls (no no)
Nooooooooo Girrrrrrrrrrls (noo, noo, noooo Babe)
Nooooooooo Girrrrrrrrrrls (NO NO)

(repeat chorus twice and fade out)
