This is just a quickie I thought of during class.  Enjoy!

Tenchi Muyo!:  Carrot

        A white coated technician is looming over the captured cabbit.  "I've
been trying to read its mind for hours.  This creature can tell us
everything about those people."

        "And you're saying you've got the same response from it every time?"

        "Yes.  I'll run it one more time so you can see."

        The machines around Ryo-Ohki start to buzz and hum as they come to
life.  She watches the screen next to her display the results:

        "Is this normal?  I mean, we should be able to see a lot more than
that.  We got the best kept secrets from people with this machine."

        "That's true, sir.  And, cabbits are supposed to be quite intelligent."

        "Well, we can't do anything with this one.  Let it go."

        Transporting away, Ryo-Ohki feels she is in a vacuum.  Transforming
into cruiser form, she takes off for home.

Later

        Ryo-Ohki lands back at the Masaki home, and is greeted by Washu.  "So,
Ryo-Ohki, you're home."

        "Meow!"

        "They didn't get anything, I suppose?"

        The little cabbit shakes her head, "meow."

        "Many have tried, all have failed.  My security system really works."

        "Meow?"

        Picking her up, "they only got what was on your mind at the time.
Which, I'm sure, was quite orange in nature."

        "Meow!"
