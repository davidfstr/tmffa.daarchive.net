Disclaimer: Except for me, I don't own any of the characters used in this FF.  
No money is passing hands here, no need to sue.  This MST is done in fun, and 
truthfully, this story isn't that bad.  Just trying my hand (and luck) with 
MSTing.

Utopia Planitia shipyards, stardate 98571.5.  The traditional breaking of a wine 
bottle to christen the new bird has already taken place, and the Captain is 
ready to go . . .

"Welcome to the maiden voyage of the MST ship Millennium Eagle.  I'm the 
Captain, Jim Ohki.  Let me give you a little tour of my new toy.  She's a 
Sovereign Class vessel, newest in the fleet.  State of the art transphasic 
weapons, shields, and transwarp drive.  Well, I need a MST crew . . . BRING IN 
THE VOLUNTEERS! (Brought to me at a substantial loss . . . bribery isn't 
cheap.)"

>From the Tenchi OAV: Tenchi Masaki and Ayeka Masaki.

>From Dragonball Z Cell Saga: Goku and Gohan.

>From PokeMon Johto: Ash Ketchum and Misty.

And the pilot, from Final Fantasy 8: Selphie Tilmitt.

Jim Ohki: "Welcome to the Millennium Eagle, MST-1071.  I am the Captain, and we 
will be doing MST's."

Tenchi and Ayeka groan, while Ash, Misty, Goku and Gohan look lost.

Jim: "Alright everybody, into the theatre.  Helm, set course 255 mark 03, engage 
at warp eight once outside of the solar system."
Selphie: "Aye, Captain."

Everybody minus Selphie are in the theatre, and seated from left to right: 
Tenchi, Ayeka, Misty, Jim, Goku, Gohan, and Ash.

>*DISCLAIMER*

Tenchi: "So far, so good . . . the first word is spelled right."

>I DO NOT BY ANY MEANS OWN TENCHI OR ANYTHING RELATING TO DRAGONBALL Z (EXCEPT
>THE 4

Ash: "Looks like something Misty would do, using . . ."
Misty: Glaring at Ash, with the trusty Anime Mallet in hand.
Ash: "I'll shut up while I'm behind . . . hehehe."
Tenchi: "It can only get worse from here . . . I just hope that it isn't a 
lemon."
Jim: "Nope.  Pulled from the crossover section.  Looks like it might be a self-
insertion, though."
All: "D'OH!"

>HE IS A PERVERT

Girls: Scream like mad, then all break out their weapons of choice.  Misty has 
the mallet, Ayeka has her log-field, and Selphie (who charged into the room) has 
her ass kickin' sticks (piece of MicroShit Word doesn't have the word I need in 
the damn dictionary.)

Jim: "SELPHIE!  What're you doin'?!  Get back to the bridge!  We're still in the 
asteroid belt!" Selphie skedaddles, with the Captain yelling at her: "THIS SHIP 
IS NEW!  I DON'T WANT IT F.U.B.A.R.!"

>SO HIS STORIES WILL BE IN THE LEMONS SECTION.  NOBODY SUE ME
>BECAUSE THEIR EFFORTS WOULD BE FOR NAUGHT.

>NO NEED FOR TIME TRAVEL

Tenchi and Ayeka: "Been there, done that.  Nothing special."

>Zero and Tenchi had been training in the hyperbolic chamber that Washuu

Tenchi: "Who?  I know a Washu, but not Washuu."
Goku: "There is no way that she has one.  The only one that I know of is now 
sealed."
Gohan: "Yeah.  This has got to be a fake or something."

>had built for quite some time now.  Tenchi's power has grown considerably and
>even though he was struggling, he was holding his own with Zero at 1000
>G's.

Ayeka: "Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought Zero became part of Ryoko."
Tenchi: "Just smile and nod, dear."

> "HYAAA!" Tenchi threw a powerful blast at Zero but narrowly missed him by
>mere inches.

Ash: "That seems . . . a little redundant, doesn't it?"
Misty: "Just smile and nod, sweetie."

>Zero countered by kicking a large, loose boulder at Tenchi, which didn't miss 
>him.  Tenchi was thrown back at a tree so hard it almost sounded as if Tenchi's 
>back had been broken and not the tree.

Goku: "It IS a fake!  There weren't any trees in the hyperbolic chamber!"
Gohan: "There wasn't much of anything other than the living space."
Goku: "Yeah, you could get lost in there."
Tenchi: "What about me?"

>Even though Zero was still pumped up, he knew when to stop.  "Ok that's
>it.
>That's enough for now."

Misty: "Since when is there a return in the middle of a sentence?"
Jim: "I don't know.  Just leave it be."
Tenchi: "What about me?"

>Tenchi got up with much effort, "Even if it wasn't I'd probably stop
>anyway."

>"You did good so I wouldn't complain even if you did."

Jim: "What the hell was that?"
Tenchi: "What about me?"
Ayeka: "What's wrong Tenchi?"
Tenchi: "So far, I've been thrown through a tree, hit with a boulder . . . this 
writer is starting to irritate me."

>Sasami called to them from the speaker, "Are you guys ok?  I thought someone
>got hurt!"

>Zero replied, "We're fine babe.

Ayeka: "YOU DO NOT TALK TO MY SISTER IN THAT MANNER!"
Jim: "HEY!  KEEP THE LOGS UNDER CONTROL, OR YOU'RE GOING OUT THE AIRLOCK!"
Tenchi: "Uh, Jim.  I wouldn't threaten her like that."
Jim: "Why?"

FFOOOOMM!

Jim: "Nevermind."
Misty: "Cleanup, aisle four."

>Are you guys ready to come in?"

Ayeka: "Any crude jokes, and there's going to be some hurtin'!"
All: `-_-

>"No.  I just wanted to tell you guys that breakfast is ready."

>The very next second, Zero and Tenchi were nowhere to be seen in the
>training
>room.

Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to the bridge.  Red alert, enemy vessel 
approaching.  Captain to the bridge."

As Jim and the MSTers reach the bridge, the Eagle rocks (no pun intended) under 
fire.

Jim: "Bring transphasic shields online, arm standard weapons.  Who is doing 
this?"

Officer 1: "Super Class Star Destroyer.  Trying to identify, might be a new 
bird."

Officer 2: "Shields and weapons are online."

Jim: "They're no threat.  I can't even feel the ship vibrate under the 
turbolaser fire."

Officer 1: "Confirmed, new SSD.  Beacon indicates the Vader's Revenge."

Jim: "HA!  Target primary reactor, fire one torpedo.  Helm, set course 188 mark 
34, speed one half impulse after the torp is away."

Officer 3: "Target locked, torpedo away."

Selphie: "Engaging impulse drive."

Onscreen, the crew can see the Super Star Destroyer off in the distance, then 
BOOM!  No more SSD.

Jim: "Now that that's done.  Stand down from red alert, step up sensor sweeps.  
I don't want anymore surprises.  And keep an eye out for the Brian Drummond and 
the JEDRI.  I wanna talk to the Captains.   Helm, set course 256 mark 12, speed 
warp eight.  Engage.  Weps, you have the Conn.  MSTers, back into the theatre we 
go."

So everybody went back into the theatre.

>As everyone sat down at the table, they noticed something odd.

Tenchi: "That we're in a crappy fic?"
Jim: "This fic isn't that bad.  If you want a bad fic, I'll bring in Tank Cop."
All minus Jim: "NO!  WE ARE OKAY!  THIS IS FINE!"

>Grey Fox was the first one to voice his opinions, "Hey Sasami, isn't this
>a

Ayeka: "There's that return again . . . this could get rather bothersome."
Tenchi: "Hey, at least he can SPELL."
Ash: "Hmmm . . ."

>little extriva. . .extravaga. . ."

>"Extravagant man!"  Finished D-Shade.

>"It's fancy!  All right smart guy?"

>Mihoshi even noticed the difference.  

Ash: "Mihoshi . . . (drool)"
Misty: "HEY!  I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND!"
Jim: "Besides, Mihoshi is mine."
Mihoshi then walks into the room: "Hey lover . . . come here."
Jim: "I'll be back in an hour."
Ash: "Hmmm . . . Misty . . . I'm sorry."
Jim pokes his head back in: "The make up sex will have to wait.  Now finish that 
fic!" Then he leaves.
Misty: "Then why does he . . .?"
Tenchi: "He's the Captain.  He can do whatever he wants."

>"Yeah Sasami this is a little much, what's the occasion?"

>Kiyone whispered to Mihoshi, "Can't you see?  She and Zero just got
>engaged!"

Ayeka: "OVER MY DEAD BODY!  I HAVE NOT EVEN MET THIS GUY!"
Tenchi: "Settle down, please.  The sooner we finish this, the sooner we can . . 
. (whispers the rest into her ear)."
Ayeka turns a few shades of red, then nods.

>"WOW REALLY??  Sasami's going to be married!"

>Zero seemed agitated.  "No we're not!

Tenchi: "See Ayeka, I told you it wasn't anything too serious."
Ayeka: "Humph."
Goku and Gohan start sparring in the back of the theatre.
Disturbed's "Down with the Sickness" starts playing on the speakers.
Chaos reins supreme.

>Even I don't know why she made
>such
>an extrava.  . ."  D-Shade was about to help him out but Zero pointed a
>finger at him, "Don't you fucking dare!"

Tenchi: "HEY!  WATCH THE LANGUAGE AROUND SASAMI!"
Misty (as Sasami): "YOU'RE A NAUGHTY BOY!"
Tenchi: "You suck at that."
Ash dives for cover, while Misty breaks out the mallet.

BAM!  CRUNCH!

Tenchi: "Ouch."

>Tenchi felt something was special that day too.  "Yeah Sasami.  What's
>up?"

>"Washuu fixed her time machine!"

>Double S spoke up, "Really?  A time machine?  You mean we could go back to
>our time?"

Ayeka: "And what is your time? Sixty million B.C., with the dinosaurs?"
Tenchi (as Double S with no teeth): "We're not that old, lady."
Misty: "YOU suck at that!"

BOOM!  BRRRRRRRRZAP!  FFOOOOMM!  KABOOM!

Misty: "Ouch.  Did anybody get the truck of that license plate?"

>"Why would you want to honey?" said Washuu as she came through the door.

>"No reason.  Just maybe to see some old friends back in our time."

>"Well you're going to have to wait.  There's still a bug

Goku: "A bug named Mihoshi?"

SNAP-HISS

Jim: "One more comment like that, and your son will have to pick you up with a 
sponge!  Capiche?"
Goku: "Yes boos."
Tenchi: "Jim, where's your pants?"
Jim: "DAMN!" Vanishes.

>somewhere.  I
>just
>can't seem to find it."

>Ryoko said, "Well hurry up Washuu!  I wanna go sight-seeing with your
>machine!"

>"Really Ryoko," scolded Ayeka, "when are you going to stop acting like a
>spoiled child?"

Ayeka: "I have better material than that, don't I?"
Tenchi: "Much better.  Besides, Washu acts like a spoiled child."
Nelson Munts: "HA, HA!"
Selphie (on speakers): "INTRUDER ALERT!  SECURITY TO MAIN THEATRE!  Captain and 
MSTers to the bridge, incoming communication."

So the MST crew meets the Captain, who got to the bridge three minutes ahead of 
them.

Jim (wearing only pants): "So, what's so important that I get called up here?"
Selphie: "Read this."
Jim: "Okay, let's see . . . 'To: Captain Jim Ohki, From: FleetStar Command.  
Starbase 132 destroyed, starbase 113 under attack.  Assailants identified as 
coalition of Imperial, Borg, and Dominion forces.  Assemble with fleet at Wolf 
359.'  The rest is for Captain's eyes only."
Tenchi: "What can we do to help?"
Jim: "I don't know yet.  Helm, set course for Wolf 359, maximum warp.  Bring 
transwarp core online, engage when ready.  All hands, red alert.  Maintain 
battle ready status until further notice.  Comm, try to find the Drummond and 
the JEDRI.  We need all the help we can get.  And would somebody get Ryo-Ohki 
here?"
Ayeka: "What about the flotilla that Jurai has?  They could help."
Jim: "Good idea.  Comm, set up a link with the Jurai Royal Palace, priority one 
communiqu‚.  Ayeka, please go over to that station."

Meanwhile, near Wolf 359 . . .

Ryo-Ohki was drifting a little, but she was fine.  And it was a good thing that 
she moved three inches to the left because ships started appearing out of warp, 
hyperspace, transwarp, whatever brought them to the arena.  The Eagle was one of 
the first to show up, with the Jurian flotilla not too far behind.  Almost every 
available ship was present, the only ones missing were the MST ships.

Jim: "Too bad that Bryan or Glyph won't be here for the fireworks.  We could use 
another Defiant class ship.  Oh well.  Weps, bring transphasic weapons online.  
Shields to maximum."
Weapons officer: "Weapons and shields are online, sir."
Comm Officer: "Sir, incoming message from Ryo-Ohki."
Jim: "Alright, on screen."
Ryoko: "You wanna watch were your goin'?!  You almost ran over me!"
Jim: "Whoops, sorry."
Selphie: "My bad."
Jim: "Come aboard, Ryoko.  We have time to kill anyway."  Ryoko's face vanishes, 
"Comm, hail the fleet."
Comm officer: "Channel open, sir."

Jim: "I'm in command, so listen up.  Interdictors, set up in a point eight light 
year corridor, and bring those gravity generators online.  Heavy cruisers, set 
up two thousand kilometers behind interdictors.  Carriers, deploy starfighters 
and assume protective stance near interdictors.  Open fire on enemy ships when 
they are POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED.  No kills permitted on civilian ships.  Let's 
kick some ass, people."  Waving a hand, he told the Comm officer that he was 
done, and to close the channel.

It was a very impressive sight indeed.  The ships totaled more than the first 
Wolf 359 disaster, such as thirty carriers, fifteen interdictors, sixty heavy 
cruisers, and almost ten thousand starfighters of various design.

Then the waiting game began . . .

Jim called the MST crew back into the theatre, now with Ryoko, and went back to 
finish his business with Mihoshi.  ^_^

>"What did you say?!"

Ryoko: "I don't have a clue, and I'm not going to read this from the beginning."

>Tenchi held them apart, "Now hold on, it's too early in the morning for
>you
>guys to be fighting already!"

Ryoko: "Let me guess, the stereotypical fight between Ayeka and myself."
Tenchi: "Yeah, and the writer didn't even use good material to make the fight 
believable.  Besides, when you two do fight, there's not a snowball's chance in 
hell of me stopping you."
Ayeka and Ryoko: "True."
Ash and Misty: O_O

>"Well all the same," said Zero, "I'd like to see this time machine of
>yours."

>"Well come on down.  I said it wasn't complete, not that it was hazardous.

Ash: "There is a quotation mark on strike."
Ayeka: "Nope.  Jim is using it for a double sweatdrop, like this."  "-_-
Jim (from somewhere): "I HEARD THAT!"
Misty: "We use those all the time with Brock."


>LATER, IN WASHUU'S LAB. . .

Ryoko: "Why can't people spell mom's name right?"
Goku and Gohan were sent home some time ago, due to lack of participation. (And 
lack of funds on the Captains part. >_<)
Ash: "I wouldn't know how it's spelled, so don't look at me."
Tenchi: "That's a good question, Ryoko."

>Everyone was ogling over the time machine.  Even though a couple of wires
>poked out, it seemed to be perfectly functional.

>Ryoko whined, "Oh c'mon Washuu!  It looks fine to me."

Ryoko: "I DON'T whine.  This writer is really getting on my nerves."

>"But it's not.  Trust me!"

>Ryoko laughed at that comment.

>"Fine Ryoko!  You think it'll work?  Let's try it!"

>As Washuu stomped over to the control switch everyone was trying to stop
>her.
> But she was too quick.

Ash: "Say, shouldn't that be a comma?"
Tenchi: "Forget that.  Washu actually has much more patience's then that."
Ayeka: "This is way OOC for us."
Jim walks back in the room, with a lit cigarette: "Ah, I feel better."
All minus Jim: Face-vault.

>"I'll try and send you guys to the past.  Hopefully it'll work.  If it
>doesn't, blame Ryoko."

Ryoko: "Why would I get blamed? Mom's stuff works ninety percent of the time 
anyway."
Jim: "Let me guess, the other ten percent is with Tenchi as the guinea pig."
Tenchi: "HEY!  THAT'S NOT FAIR!"
Ayeka: "Oh, do calm down.  It's true what Jim says, and you know it."
Ryoko: "Washu uses Tenchi as a guinea pig?"
Jim: "Must have the TV Ryoko."

>She typed in the year 0 B.C.

>Double S said, "Cool.  We get to meet Jesus!"

>Grey Fox replied, "You're not Christian dumb-ass."

>"Oh yeah."

>As Washuu was putting in the final computations, a look of fear came across
>her face.  A shower of sparks shot out of the control board almost setting
>her on fire.  At the same time, the rest of the gang seemed to flicker and
>dissapear.

Tenchi: "And there it is, folks.  I really don't know what that word is, but I 
wanna disappear."

>The last words they heard from Washuu were, "Oh cra-"

Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to the bridge, enemy vessels dropping out of 
warp.  Captain to the bridge."

Jim and company got to the bridge in a rush, minus Ryoko.  She and Ryo-Ohki were 
sent out to join the fleet.

Jim: "Computer, cloak the ship.  Authorization Ohki, tango, mike, foxtrot, 
foxtrot, alpha."
Tenchi: "Why did you have to use an authorization code to cloak?"
Jim: "We aren't supposed to have cloaking devices.  How shush, I have to think."

On the viewer, there were pieces of the first ships to be forced out of light 
speed.  It had been figured that the most damaged ships would come in first, to 
assess the enemy's forces.

Then the enemy fleet appeared . . . and all hell broke loose.

The first ships to appear and not disintegrate were fifteen Super Star 
Destroyers.  Then there came twenty cubes.  Tenchi looked like he might get 
cocky, from the way he was talking to Ryoko.

Tenchi: "That's it? Thirty-five ships?  We can beat them easily."
Jim: "Comm, hail the fleet."
Comm Officer: "Channel open."
Jim: "All ships, pull up.  It's a trap!  Pull out and reassemble at Mars."
Comm officer: "Orders acknowledged, sir."
Jim: "Standby weps, computer drop cloak.  Open fire on all enemy vessels.  And 
get Ryo-Ohki back on board!"

Flashes everywhere, signifying the firefight, of the thirty-five ships killed 
with thirty-five transphasic torpedoes fired by the Eagle.  And then there was a 
lot of that cool special effect of ships jumping to warp, heading for the last 
fight.

Tenchi: "Why did we pull out?!"
Jim: "The Dominion is involved in the attack against us.  None of their ships 
came out of warp.  They went around us, and are headed for Earth.  But we have 
something they don't have . . . helm, engage transwarp drive.  Maximum 
velocity."
Engineering Officer: "Sir, we've never pushed the transwarp drive to the limit . 
. ."
Jim: "Then this will get interesting.  Hail all transwarp capable ships in the 
fleet, tell them to push their luck."
Comm Officer: "Done, sir.  Receiving acknowledgements from four other ships."
Jim: "Not enough . . . damn!  Helm, let's go! MSTers, back to the theatre.  This 
story isn't finishing itself."

>    When he woke up, Zero found that everyone else had been knocked out by
>whatever had happened.  Sasami was the first thing that came to his mind.
>He

Ryoko: "Rogue return off the starboard bow, Captain."
Jim: "That's the only one you get Ryoko, Ayeka already pointed out two of those 
(indicates bad return areas).  It's getting obscure."

>rushed over to her side and lifted her head.

>	"Sasami," he asked, "are you all right?"

Jim: "But we haven't said anything about tabs in the wrong place."
Ryoko: "I can't think of anything good."

>"Yes. I'm fine.  We better check on the others."

>They went around to everybody to make sure they were ok.  So far everyone
>was
>all right unless you counted Ayeka who got a bump on her head.

Ayeka: "WHAT THE?!  I'M THE ONLY ONE HURT?!  I'LL SHOW YOU HURT!" (tries to 
vaporize viewer, gets shocked herself.) "Ouch."
Tenchi and Ash: "Bummer."
Girls: "Poor Ayeka."
Jim (laughing): "OH MY GOD!  AND THE QUARTERBACK IS TOAST!"
All: Glare at Jim.
Jim: "Must not be Die Hard fans . . ."

>Grey Fox seemed concerned, "Hey Ayeka, how's your head?"

>A few seconds later he was lying face down in the center of a smoldering
>crater, his clothes torn and ripped till they were almost unrecognizable.

Ayeka: "I can do that?"
Tenchi: "Not that I'm aware of."
Ryoko: "If you tried really hard, then I guess you could."
Jim: "And you guys don't see the redundancy of the clothes remark?"
Ash: "Misty and I have decided to sit in silence, since you guys could easily 
turn us into powder."
Jim: "Alright, fine.  You two go have your sex fun, or whatever it is that you 
do."
Ash and Misty run for the door, happy to finally be alone.

>ELSEWHERE. . .

>Four mysterious youths were training off in the mountains.  There were three
>boys, and one girl, who took care of most of the cooking (Hey I'm not a
>chauvinist).  They had been there for quite awhile and they sort of enjoyed
>this lifestyle.  It was actually quite peaceful when they stopped training.
>All of a sudden their leader stopped.  Something was very odd.  The girl
>walked up to him.

>"Is something wrong?" she asked.

Ryoko (as leader): "Yeah.  I feel like . . . we're in a . . . slightly bad fic."
Jim: "Ryoko, don't try the William Shatner around me, please."
Tenchi: "And don't make Jim bring in the Tank Cop fics, please."

>"I don't know," he replied, "I just felt a power increase of somewhere in
>the
>west.  The thing is, I never felt this presence before."

Ayeka: "Of what?"
Tenchi: "I think he meant off, dear."
Ryoko: "Tenchi . . . you picked her?"
Jim: "These two are from the OAV universe.  Tenchi is still available in your 
universe."
Ryoko: "Oh, okay."

>A strange alien with green skin came up to him, "Do you think we should
>check
>it out?"

>"You read my mind Shou.  Let's go, but be on guard.  We don't know what

>They raised their power level high enough to to defend themselves.  Their

Jim: "What the hell is that?"
Tenchi: "Enough with the Will Riker impression."
Sounds of sex can be heard.
Saliva's "Click, Click BOOM" can be heard on the speakers.
Chaos called in, said he's on vacation.

>up in the air and turned a golden blond, as if by magic.
>Except for Shou, who had no hair at all.  They then shot off into the sky,
>to
>meet the new arrivals.

Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to the bridge."
Jim: "You guys keep going.  I'll be back."
Jim leaves the theatre.
Jim (outside): "ASH! MISTY! GET YOUR ASSES BACK IN THE THEATRE NOW!"
Ash and Misty run back in, getting dressed on the way.

>BACK IN THE FIELD. . .

>As soon as everyone was accounted for (And Grey Fox given a new set of
>clothes), they decided to try and find out where they were.  However there
>surroundings were very unfamiliar.  Where the house used used to be, was now
>an open field.

>"Okay," said Double S, "where the hell are we?"

>"I know," said Tenchi, "this place looks so weird!"

>Ryoko was furious, "Damn that Washuu she messed up again!"

Ryoko: "Please, spare me!"

>Ayeka turned on her, "Well if you hadn't of complained and whined like a
>little spoiled brat none of this would've happened!"

Ryoko: "Is that the material that he tried to use last time?"
Tenchi and Ayeka: "Uh huh.  Bad, isn't it?"
Ryoko: "That's pathetic!"

>"You're one to talk about being spoiled, you little tramp!"

Ash: "You call that bad material?  If I called Misty that, she'd . . ."

SMASH! CRUNCH! BAM!

Misty thwomps Ash with the mallet.
Ash (in a lot of pain): "Do that."
Jim (on speakers): "HEY, HEY ON THE MALLET, MISTY!  YOU BREAK IT, YOU BOUGHT 
IT!"

>"WHAT!?"

Tenchi: "That's what we said when we found out that we'd be here."

>"Shut up!" shouted Zero.  He appeared to be sensing something.

Linkin Park's "One Step Closer" starts playing on the speakers.
All (In sync with the music): "SHUT UP WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU!"

>Sasami asked, "What is it hon?"

>"There are some high power levels coming this way from the east.  Be careful
>these people may be dangerous."

>"Look," said Mihoshi, "I can see them!"  Indeed she did.

Tenchi: "And there was much celebration."
Rest: "Whoo-hoo."

>Four bright lights were flying toward them at a fast speed.  To Zero's
>shock,
>three of them had an all too familiar golden aura around them.  But for some
>reason, one of them didn't.  But something about one of the others seemed
>strange, like he was holding something back.

Ash: "So that would make two of the four that he had questions about?"
Misty: "Don't try to rationalize the work.  Just read it, smile and nod."
Tenchi: "Bossy bitch.  Did that just come out of my mouth?"
Jim (walking back in the room): "You want a bossy bitch?" (Pulls out a 
communicator, speaks into it, then puts it away.)
Jesse from Team Rocket, Misty from the first PokeMon series, and Chi-Chi from 
DBZ suddenly appeared.
Jim: "There you go.  They don't get any bossier than that."
Girls: Glaring at Jim.
Jim: "You three, go have fun in the holodeck."
The new arrivals leave.

>As they arrived, The mysterious youths descended in front of Zero and the
>others.  Three Super Saiyans, and one Namek.

Mihoshi: "Oh Jim . . ."
Jim: "Coming dear!" (He leaves.)
Ryoko: "What?"
Tenchi: "Don't ask.  Captain's privilege."
Ryoko: "Oh . . ."

>The leader spoke up, "Who are you?  Where did you come from?"

>Zero decided that he would speak, "We just came from Okayama, Japan and we
>were wondering where we were."

>The leader raised an eyebrow, "You're in Okayama, Japan my friend.  Where
>did
>you really come from?"

>Zero was shocked to say the least.  But he didn't show it.  "And who may I
>ask are you?"

>The man got a stern look on his face, "I believe the real question is the
>one
>I asked before,  'Who are you?'  Now are you going to be nice about it,
>or
>do you just wanna get fucked up?"  He was itchin' for a fight.

Tenchi: "Both are real questions, and you know it.  What's with the language, 
anyway?"
Ryoko: "All I can say is duh to the itchin' part."
Union Underground's "South Texas Death Ride" is now playing, with everybody head 
banging.

>The girl put her hand on his arm, "Hey!  Take it easy," she looked at Zero,
>"sorry, Chazo's not much of a people person."

>She let her hair go back to normal, "My name is Mia, the other guy with the
>blond hair is his brother Jeigo.  The Namek over there is named Shou."

>Zero returned the courtisy, "My name is Zero.  This is my crew, Grey Fox,
>D-Shade, and Double S.  The others are my friends, Ryoko, Ayeka, Mihoshi,
>Kiyone, and my girl Sasami, and hey," someone was missing, "where's Washuu?"

>Tenchi answered, "She must have gotten left behind in the transfer."

>"Well shit, that means we're stuck here."

>Chazo spoke up, "Um I'd hate to brake up the bitchuing fest but, I think you
>should come with us.  Now."

Ayeka: "Wrong break, I think."
Ryoko: "And what the hell is bitchuing?"
Tenchi: "Probably a typo."
Ash and Misty: "We HOPE so."

>"Yeah?"  Zero was also ready for battle, "what if we don't want to?"

>"Shou, why don't you show what you can do against," Chazo pointed at Double
>S, "him."

>Shou grinned a pointy-toothed grin, "No problem man."

>Double S seemed a little hesitant, "Should I Zero?"

>Zero nodded with approval.  And so it was Double S V.S. Shou.

>THE FIGHT: ROUND ONE

>As Double S prepared for the fight, Chazo gave Shou a little pep talk.

>"Look Shou, this guy's got nothing on you.  Remember you're a Super Namek!
>And don't worry," he put his hand on Shou's shoulder, "I've got your back in
>case they try anything funny."

>Zero was also giving his man a small pep talk, "Listen S, this guy's got
>nothing on you.  Remember, you're a Super Saiyan!  And don't worry," he put
>his hand on Double S's shoulder, "I've got your back in case they try
>anything funny."

Jim (from outside): "This is like a W.C.W. (Wussies Can't Wrestle) event . . . 
too much talk, not enough action."
Tenchi: "Jim, what are you doing?"
Jim: "I plead the fifth, oh yyyyyeaaaaaaaahhhhhhh . . ."

>"Chazo raised his hand, "Wait!  We need an appropriate ring"

All: @_@
Tenchi: "His paragraph structure went on strike."
Ayeka: "Went?  It was never here."
Rest: "Hear, hear."

>Chazo put his hands together and appeared to be humming softly.  His hands
>began to glow with a golden light.  His eyes also began to change from green
>to a blood-red.  Then, strangely enough, the ground below him began to
>smooth
>and flatten out.  The others moved out of the way as large rocks came off of
>the mountain and seemed to be carved by an invisible chisel, taking the
>shape
>of a 2'x2' flat square.  They placed themselves on the flattened are that
>Chazo had made and began to form a platform.

>Zero was stunned, "That can't be. . ."

>D-Shade, "That's a World Martial Arts Tournament ring!"

>Grey Fox, "I don't believe it.  I didn't think anybody knew about it."

>Soon, Chazo was laying down the final bricks to complete his ring.

>"Now we're ready to begin.  You know the Rules of the WMAT so, Shou come on
>up."

BOOM!  SMACK!  CRASH!

Everybody runs to the bridge, trying to figure out what was going on.
Jim (with Mihoshi right behind him, both clad in towels): "REPORT!"
Weps: "My bad, had the sound effects for the MST turned up too high."
Jim: "You're relieved.  Comm, you now have weps.  Helm, you have double duty."
Selphie: "Thanks a lot, dumb-ass."
Jim: "Back to the theatre again."
Everybody returns, minus the lovebirds.

>The green Namek entered the ring proud and strong, as if he trained for this
>a long time.  Then Double S entered the ring, also ready for the upcoming
>battle.  As Double S looked Shou in the eye, he knew that he was a ruthless
>fighter.  They then got into their respective fighting stances.

>Mia shouted, "C'mon Shou!  Show him what you got!"

>Shou powered up first, in an attempt to intimidate his opponent.  As he did,
>His muscles began to bulge and his muscles became much more ripped.  He also
>seemed to grow slightly in height to a staggering 6'7".

Ryoko: "Redundant again, I see."

>Shou cocked a smile, "Come on Saiyan, show me what you got!"

>Double S then proceeded to use his transformation.  Electricity crackled all
>around him and his hair shot up in a firey gold.  However, Shou didn't seem
>all too impressed.

>"Oh give me a break!  You think that shit's gonna work on me?"

>"Well maybe not.  SO HOW BOUT THIS?!"

>Just then Double S powered up again, his hair growing longer in length, and
>the aura around him grew to an enormous height.  Shou was stunned to say the
>least.

>"Wow.  You went to the second stage.  I'm impressed, at least you'll make
>this fight interesting now!"

>Shou lunged at Double S throwing powerful, precise punches at his abdomen
>that SS tried as hard as he could to block, but just barely.  SS came back
>and countered with a powerful elbow to the teeth that just barely grazed the
>side of Shou's head.  As they gave themselves some room, they powered up for
>their first energy attacks.

>Shou raised his hand toward SS and shouted, "MASENKO BLAST!"  And out from
>his hand shot a bright blast at SS that he dodged fairly easily.  As the
>shot
>roared past him, it smashed into the mountain, tearing a good chunk of it to
>pieces.  SS then used an attack of his own.

>"KAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYHAAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAAY,"  as he was shouting this,
>a brilliant bluish-white light filed his hands as they glowed with pure
>energy.

>Shou was flabbergasted, "NO WAY!  THAT'S A KAMEHAMEHA!"

By this point, none of the MSTers are paying any attention.

>"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" Double S released the blast sending Shou flying out of
>the ring and almost into the mountains, but then strangely, he disappeared.
>Nobody saw him go anywhere.

>"What the hell?" said Zero, "Where'd that guy go?"

>Double S was about ready to power down but before he could get a chance,
>Shou
>reappeared behind him and rabbit-punched him in the back.  As SS grimaced in
>pain, Shou took the opportunity to capitalize on this.  He raised two
>fingers
>and shouted, "SPECIAL BEAM CANNON," he pointed his fingers at SS, "FIRE!"

>SS had no time to react and was struck by the blast which sent him crashing
>to the ground outside of the ring.  Zero and his crew, were dissapointed.

>"Damn," said Zero, "he almost won too."

>"It's not over yet." Said Chazo.

>"Huh?"

>"Look at his feet.  They aren't touching the ground outside, but are still
>inside the ring.  Your man still has a chance at this."

>Zero shouted, "DOUBLE S, GET UP!  IT'S NOT OVER YET!"

Selphie (on speakers): "Red alert, Captain to the bridge.  We've reached Mars."

Jim and the MSTers made a fast break for the bridge, minus Ryoko who again went 
out with Ryo-Ohki.

Jim: "Bring transphasic weapons, shields online.  Status of the fleet?"
Weps: "We lost a ship in transwarp, sir.  There's only four of us here."
Jim: "Great, just great.  Where's the Dominion fleet?"
Weps: "Currently at Pluto, closing fast.  Rest of our fleet is twenty minutes 
behind them."
Jim: "How many?"
Weps: "Unknown . . . minimum five thousand."
All: "We're dead."

Ten minutes later the fight began . . .

At first, all seemed to be going well.  The transphasic weapons on the Eagle 
were killing off Dominion ships left and right.  The Eagle alone scored four 
thousand, nine hundred kills.  The rest of the fleet wasn't fairing too well, 
with twenty carriers, ten interdictors, and fifty cruisers having been turned 
into dust, or burning hulls.  But then the Dominion's pals arrived, making life 
difficult.

Weps: "Sir!  Another thousand ships just dropped out of warp.  Cubes, Star 
Destroyers."
Jim: "Damn . . . are we the ONLY ship outfitted with transphasic weapons?  We've 
gotten too many kills."
Weps: "Yes, sir.  We're the only ship in the . . . sir, another ship just 
dropped out of warp.  It's the Enterprise."

As the crew watched the Enterprise take out a few dozen ships with her quantum 
torpedoes, a miracle happened.

Weps: "Sir . . . transwarp conduit at bearing 233 mark 22."
Jim: "Let's hope they're leaving."

One Borg sphere appeared, then disintegrated . . . with Voyager coming out of 
the fireball.

Jim: "Comm, hail Voyager!"
Selphie: "Channel open, sir."
Jim: "Perfect timing Voyager!  Open fire on the pizzas and Rubix cubes, the 
moths are done for!"

Within a few minutes, there was nothing left of the attacking fleet.  Then the 
celebration began, as the salvage crews started moving through what was left of 
both fleets.  The Eagle turned back to her original heading, and left Sol.

Jim: "Let's finish that story, and get some sleep.  There will be more MSTs to 
do."

>Shou also sensed that the battle wasn't over yet

Jim: "It BETTER be over!"
Rest: "AMEN!"

>and charged at him ready to
>finish him off.  He raised his hand to perform a masenko blast, but before
>he
>got a chance, he stopped, dead in his tracks.  Double S's knee was pressed
>firmly into Shou's groin, shortening the amount of possible offspring that
>he
>could have.  He doubled over, grasping his nuts in agony.

Guys: "OUCH!  Sympathy pains!"

>SS then gave Shou a powerful uppercut that sent him flying into the air.  He 
>sped up to him and delivered a flying spin kick that sent Shou crashing toward 
>the ground, feet and all.  Their battle was over, with Double S the victor, 
>much to Chazo's chagrin.

>"Well Chazo," gloated Zero, "looks like your boy couldn't do a whole lot."

>Chazo merely grunted in response.

>All of a sudden, Mia stepped up, "I challenge him!"  She was pointing to
>D-Shade.

>D-Shade was bewildered, "Are you fucking kidding me?  I don't fight girls!"

>Zero glared at him, "Oh yes you do."

>"Since when?"

>"Since. . .now."

Ash: "Nice when other people tell you how you feel."
Jim: "They call that marriage, bro."
Guys: "D'OH!"
Girls: "WHOO-HOO!"

>And so it was Mia v.s. D-Shade.

>THE FIGHT: ROUND TWO

>As Mia stepped on to the platform, she didn't have the same attitude as
>Shou.
 >Her's was

Tenchi: "Watch out for echo canyon . . ."
Jim: "Lame."

>more cautious. She knew that Shou's downfall had been his
>arrogance, and that she would not make the same mistake that he did.  Even
>though she couldn't quite make the SS2 stage, she would rely on her skill to
>help her in this match.

>D-Shade was very adamant about not fighting Mia.  He wanted absolutely no
>part of this whatsoever.  He pleaded with Zero not to make him fight her.

>"Come on Zero!  I can't hit her, she's a-"

>"I know very well what she is.  But frankly I don't care, a challenge has
>been made, I don't want to have anything to do with someone who turns any
>challenge down.  You don't fight, I turn my back on you."

>D-Shade was shocked at the harshness in Zero's answer.  Never had his
>comerade ever spoke to him in this way.  But he knew that he wasn't joking
>at
>all.  So, reluctantly, he stepped up to the platform, where Mia was waiting.

>"I hope you know this is pretty embarresing!" said D-Shade.

>"It is for me too!"

>"Why is that?"

>"I don't like to beat up cry babies."

Ryoko: "That sounds a lot like me . . ."
Tenchi and Ayeka: "You said it, not me!"

>"WHAT?"

Jim: "Is Stone Cold in the house or something?  There's all these what's 
floating around . . ."

>D-Shade quickly transformed into a Super Saiyan at the same time she did.
>He
>lunged at her trying to hit her, but she was just too damn fast.  He threw
>another roundhouse, which she countered with a kick to the back of the head,
>which sent him sprawling.

>"What the hell?!"  He was in shock.  No one does that to me, bitch!"

>"Don't call me a bitch you fag!"

>He was beyond angry now.  Not only had she kicked him, she insulted him
>immediately after that.

>"You're not getting away with that!"

Tenchi: "He who is quick to anger, is quick to having his ass kicked."

>And with that he transformed again into the Super Saiyan two stage.  Mia was
>in trouble now.

>"Oh shit!  Now what?"

>Mia was beginning to panic when all of a sudden she received a powerful blow
>to her stomach that send her flying out of the ring.  But before she fell to
>the ground, she flew back at him in a vain attempt to throw him off guard.
>He merely back-handed her to the ground.  Mia now had blood steaming down
>her
>nose, and out of her mouth.

>"What are you doing?  I'm a woman."

Girls: "SO BLOODY WHAT?!  WE CAN FIGHT BETTER THAN THAT!"
Guys: "CHEAP SHOT!"

>D-Shade immediately felt guilty.  "I'm sorry.  I-"

>Before he could finish his words, Mia gave him a strong uppercut to the chin
>that sent him flying.  But it was for naught.  Immediately, he fired a
>Masenko blast at her which hit her dead on.  She lay on the ground, a
>battered and bloody mess.  As D-Shade came down, he was amazed to find that
>she had disappeared.  Then he saw her from above, appearing to be wiggling
>her fingers in front of her.

>"Let's see you get by this!"

>Threadlike beams came out of her fingers and began to form into a ball in
>front of her.  The ball was not unlike that of a ball of yarn.  Then after
>it
>was about as big as a beach ball, it compressed down to the size of a
>marble.
 >She then began to add more threads to it till it was about the size of a
>bowling ball.  D-Shade was getting nervous, although he was stronger than
>her, this blast was extremely powerfull.  She then threw the ball at him,
>causing an explosion which sent him flying out of the ring and though two
>mountains before he finally fell to the ground, a defeated man.

All: O_O "WTF?!"

>Zero was stunned, "I don't believe it!  What the hell happened?"

>Chazo chuckled, "That's her Kameha-yarn ball.  Each inch of one thread has
>the power of one kamehameha.  I doubt that even you could withstand a move
>like that."

Ryoko: "Did somebody say yarn ball?"
Rest: Face-vault.
Ryoko: "Sorry, it's the cat in me . . . =^.^="

>As D-Shade walked back to the group, it was obvious that he felt embarresed
>and dejected.  He let himself be beaten by a woman.  He was expecting Zero
>to
>shun him off but to his surprise, he shook his hand.

>"You did a good job out there.  And that stuff I said before, don't worry
>about it.  I just said that so you would get into the ring."

>"Thanks Zero."  Although he didn't feel like thanking anybody at that point.

>"Hmm, well is that it Zero?  Or do you propose another match?"

>"As a matter of fact I do."

>"Who?"

>Grey fox was ready and waiting.  He knew Zero was going to pick him and he
>wanted him to.  Since he saw how powerful Jeigo was, he knew he would be the
>perfect challenge.

>"Chazo. . ."

>Everyone was waiting for his answer, all with different possibilities in
>their minds.

>". . .I challenge you!"

>THE FIGHT: FINAL ROUND

>"What?"

>"You heard me."

>Chazo was clearly not expecting this.  But nonetheless, he was excited.

>"Fine.  But let's do one thing first."

>"What's that?"

>"Let's get rid of this pesky ring."

>He proceeded to fly up and form a powerful energy ball in his hands.

>"EVERYONE, GET OUT OF THE WAY NOW!" shouted Zero.

>Just as everyone cleared the way, Chazo threw the ball at the platform
>smashing it into a thousand tiny pieces.  Again Ayeka was the only one who
>got a minor injury.  A small cut on her forehead.

Jim: "DUCK AND COVER!"
Ayeka: "WTF?!  AGAIN WITH ONLY ME GETTING HURT?!  I'LL SHOW YOU!"
Grabs Misty's mallet, and smacks the screen.

WHA-PANG! SMACK! BOING! ZIP-CRACK! CHINK!

Jim: "That will be five million dollars, Ayeka."
Ayeka: "Why?"
Jim: "Well, those things aren't cheap."
Ryoko: "Yes they are."
Jim: "Not the ones with three dimensional surround viewing, Dolby surround 
sound, and free popcorn."
Ayeka: "Oh."
Ryoko: "Where's the popcorn?"

>Grey Fox seemed concerned again, "Hey Ayeka, how's your-."  He stopped
>himself as he remembered what happened the last time he said that to her.

>As the smoke cleared, Chazo transformed to a Super Saiyan 2, confident that
>Zero couldn't match his experienced level.  But Zero proved him wrong by
>doing the same and powering up to an SS2.  Chazo was a little surprised, but
>still confidant that Zero didn't have nearly as much experience as he did.

>However, he was mistaken.

>Zero said, "Hey Chazo, don't act so cocky!"

>And in that instant, he threw a masenko blast that almost blew Chazo's head
>off.  Chazo countered with a haymaker that missed by mere inches.  Zero
>threw
>a kick that Chazo caught in his hands.  Rather than panicking, Zero merely
>flipped over kicking Chazo's head with an ensiguri.  As Chazo was holding
>his
>head, Zero smashed his fist into Chazo's gut, but hit only air due to a
>sanzuken.  Chazo then threw a kick of his own that Zero caught.  Chazo also
>tried to due an ensiguri, but Zero ducked and let Chazo's foot go, which was
>a mistake.  Chazo landed on his foot and kicked Zero directly in the mouth,
>blood spraying everywhere.

>Chazo knew that this fight was his.  This guy was just an amateur.  Chazo
>began to walk away from the battle, but Zero held up his hand.

Tenchi: "Talk about cocky."
Jim: "DUH!  What do you expect?"

>"You think just from one hit, the battle's over?  You ain't seen nothing
>yet!"

>This amused Chazo, but then a look of terror crossed his face.  Zero beggan
>to glow even more intensly and the golden fire grew larger and brighter.
>His
>hair grew long and down to his calves, his eyebrow ridges pushed out with
>the
>eyebrows completely gone.  Indeed, Zero had gone to the Super Saiyan 3
>stage.

>Chazo was almost scared, "Wha- what the hell?  What the hell are you?!"

>Zero replied, "Your worst nightmare."

Jim: "Goku would be so mad, with the bad reference to his line."

>Chazo began to think to himself, "This is impossible!  I'm the most powerful
>Saiyan alive, how can this amateur be more powerful than I am?  Agh!
>There's
>got to be some way to win.  I can't beat him in pure strength, that much is
>obvious.  So how?  I guess I'll just have to rely on my skill.  Hopefully he
>hasn't surpassed me there."  Then he remembered something.  "No I can't use
>that, if I do, it may backfire.  I guess I'll keep it as a last resort."

>Zero felt confident that Chazo would back down.  "So Chazo, have you given
>up
>yet?"

>Chazo forced a confident smile, "Not on your life!  Power isn't everything.
>Even the most powerful warrior can be killed by the weakest peasant."

Tenchi: "That sounds like grandpa talking."

>Zero was obviously disturbed by his response.  He was right.  If he had more
>skill, Chazo might pull out an upset victory.  He would have to rely on his
>strength and quickness to win this.

>Chazo charged at Zero which threw him off-guard.  Zero threw a punch at him
>but hit air.  Chazo reappeared above him and smashed his foot on top of his
>head.  Zero was momentarily stunned by this and Chazo took this chance and
>kicked him in the mouth yet again, this time causing Zero to lose one of his
>teeth.  Zero was pissed.  He threw a energy blast at Chazo that missed him
>by
>only 1/2 an inch.  Zero then threw a rapid fire that Chazo tried as hard as
>he could to dodge.  Chazo decided to try his own offensive.

>Chazo reared back his right hand as an energy bal formed within, "Not even
>you can dodge this one Zero!  SPEED BLAST!"

>He threw the ball forward and just before it struck it's target, Zero
>disappeared.  The ball sped on, punching a hole in the mountain about a foot
>wide.  Chazo was at a loss.  Where did that idiot go?  He was answered with
>a
>knee to the back of his head and a kick to his stomach.  As Chazo doubled
>over in pain, Zero geared up for another blast.

>"KAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAYHAAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAY. . ."

>Chazo knew then that his strategy was going to work.

>"HAAAAAAAAAAA!"

>Zero threw his hands forward and the blast just managed to singe the edge of
>Chazo's blue hair.  Zero was wondering, how the hell?  Just at that moment,
>Chazo was right behind Zero.  He grabbed Zero's head and squeezed slightly.
>Zero thought this was so pointless, but why was it so hard to get out of
>this?  Grey Fox was confused.  Why didn't Zero break the hold?  Then he saw
>why, Zero seemed to be paralized and his eye's were slightly dialated.  His
>eye's showed a side of fear that Grey Fox had never seen.

>    Just then Zero transformed back to a SS2, and everyone knew the score.
>Chazo was absobring some of Zero's energy.  As Chazo let go of Zero, he was
>much more powerful than before.  Zero was on the ground trying to get away
>from Chazo.  At this point, Chazo indeed surpassed Zero in strength.

>"What the hell did you do to me?" said Zero.

>"Well you don't have to worry that much.  I only took enough to learn a few
>of your techniques.  I got a few interesting morsels of information."

>D-Shade reached into his pouch and pulled out a sensu bean.  "Hey Zero
>catch!"

>He threw the bean and as Zero caught it, Chazo took a step back and seemed a
>little nervous.  "What the hell is this shit?"

>As Zero popped the bean in his mouth he replied, "This shit evens up the
>score!"

All: "EEEEWWWWW!  HE'S EATING SHIT!"

>Zero then got his energy back and he transformed back into the SS3 stage
>Chazo still seemed a little confident.

>"Hmm, this isn't going to be as bad as I thought.  I think I have enough of
>your energy to sustain me through this fight."

>"Screw you!"

>Zero powered up for a Kamehameha, but was stunned when Chazo began to do the
>same.  But it didn't look right, his hands were in the wrong position.  Then
>he knew why.

>Chazo began to shout out, "SHOOOOOOOODUUUUUUUUUU. . ."

>Zero began his own attack, "KAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAYHAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAY. . ."

>"KAAAAAAAAAAAAN!"

>"HAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"

>The two blasts met in the middle and as they touched, a preliminary
>explosion
>occurred and the blasts had a huge amount of energy eminating from them.
>Grey Fox looked fearfull.

>"They can't hold this for long!  If they do it could be disasterous."

>Just as he said that, there was a huge power overload and the blast grew to
>enormous size, engulfing Zero and Chazo in this, disintegrating them
>instantly.  Sasami was in shock that her love had been killed.  Double S
>however saw something else dangerous.

>"Oh my god!  GET OUT OF HERE EVERYONE!"

>But it was too late, the blast explosion grew and grew until they were all
>consumed by the energy, and disintegrated.  They had all perished.

>END PART ONE

All: "That was anticlimactic."
Jim: "But it's over . . . finally . . ."

>Next Time:

>Incase you were wondering, yes, the brave warriors all were all killed by the
>blast.  Upon their death, they were sent to the afterlife where they were
>invited to attempt to compete in the Grand Kai's Tournament.  When they get
>to the planet, Zero meets up with some old friends from his time.  Find out
>what happens next time on Tenchi Ball Z!

Jim: "General review before I let you go home for the night."
Tenchi: "We really didn't have any parts after dinner . . . that sucked."
Ayeka: "And why did I end up with all of the injuries?!"
Ryoko: "I don't whine.  We need more air time."
Ash: "Well, in short, the beginning was actually good.  But the story blew a 
fart about half way through, and stunk the rest of the way."
Misty: "Yeah.  The author of this fic has excellent potential, so I bet a 
rewrite would make it better."
Jim: "Alright, good enough for me.  You're all on active duty, so expect to be 
pulled back into my gravity well anytime I want . . . hehehe."

Good fight, good night . . .

And to the author of the fic: You do have excellent potential . . . just lose 
the EXTREME superhero stuff, give Tenchi and Co. more air time, and your stories 
will be killer.

Glyph, Bryan . . . I would like to join forces with you two.  When ever you have 
the time, contact me, please.  ^_^
