Except for Jay "Turbo" Magnus and the Anime Star, nothing used in this story
is my property. I'm not paying to use the characters, nor am I making money
from them. The MSTed MST is one of Brian Weber's, a fellow MST Syndicate
member. Brian, since both of us want to MST it, by way of apology if you
hate this MST, I'd like to work with you on MSTing Kanashii no Imi.

Anime Star MSTs #6
By: Turbo Magnus

It had been almost two weeks without any MSTs since Jay "Turbo" Magnus had
been given full command of the Anime Star by the Author. Hoag the Kangaroid
hopped onto the bridge carrying two root beers. The scene was something out
of a sci-fi movie, Jay was at the helm, half-asleep.

"Thanks. You read my mind." Jay said as Hoag handed him a root beer.

"I still don't see why you always take the blinkin' night shift, mate."

"I have my reasons."

"And I asked them-"

[BLAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR! BLAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRR!]

Hoag dropped into the con seat, "We're in the path of an unidentified object
moving at near light speed..."

Jay and Hoag frantically checked their displays.

"BUT WHERE IS IT?!"

"THERE! STEALTH FIELD!"

"It looks like a... Type 13 probe!"

"In this part of the system?"

The two saw it through the front screen: A huge derelict unmanned scout
probe tumbling directly toward them at terrific speed. Hoag hit a button for
the emergency retros and fired the rockets. The Anime Star torqued to one
side. The probe grazed the ship, cutting a huge gash in the Star's hull. As
it passed by, it came online and transmitted a signal...

"Turbo! The probe is sending a fic!"

"DAMN! Sound the alarm!"

[[[COME ON YOU APES! YOU WANTA LIVE FOREVER?]]]

Hoag flipped on the shipwide com system, ":Attention all personnel, we have
been hit with a fic fired at us. We don't care if you shine or not, just
rise!"

"Hoag, It's going to take the others a few minutes, so I'll start alone,"
Jay scanned a summary of the fic, "Tell Washu she gets to sit this one
out..."

"Why?"

"For our safety. Just give her any old excuse."

"Righto, cap'n."

[Jay enters a command level access code to bypass the door system.]

JAY: First, someone's been watching or reading too much Starship Troopers.
Second, who's attacking us and why?

[Fic starts]

As the USS Brian Drummond speeds through the darkness of the infinite void,
Weber-san sighs. He's worked hard to make this ship run smoothly, and at the
same time run a successful MST operation.

JAY: Since taking full command, I can sympathize...
*FLASHBACK*
"I'm no longer going to appear in the MSTs, so you will have complete
control over everything on the ship, CAPTAIN Magnus." The Author said.

"What!? Why?"

"Jay, I've given you this ship, your wings if you will. Now it's time for
you to fly. Remember quote Megumi Kouhosei #1?"
*Flashback fades to present as Jay repeats the words...*
JAY: "For those with wings, fly to your dreams." Now I think I understand...
*RELENA enters*
RELENA: What was that?
JAY: Just something a friend was trying to tell me...

But all the while, there have been newer and more disgusting lemons. And to
make matters worse, his crew, none of which he owns, all of whom are the
property of Funimation, Gainax, AIC, Pioneer, Sunrise, and ADV,

*Jok, Trowa, Tom, and Crow stumble in.*
RELENA: What took you?
JOK: We were sleeping... Unlike you and the ‘Captain'...
JAY(Barely contained rage): Just what are you insinuating, MR. Tadsworth?
TOM(whisper to CROW): He used the last name...
CROW(Whisper to TOM): Jok is in TROUBLE!
JOK: Nothing, CAPTAIN MAGNUS.
HOAG(PR): ‘Ay boss, is Lena in there?
JAY(Calming): NO, I mean no, she isn't. *Taps combadge* Magnus to Tauros,
WAKE UP!
LENA(Over com, sleepy): Tell the warden it's too late, they already pulled
the switch.
JAY(False sweetness): Lena, get in here or I'll write you into a lemon with
Harry.
LENA(Over Com): I'M COMING!!!
*Lena enters.*
RELENA: Instantaneous movement?
LENA: Yep. Turbo, where's Washu?
JAY: It's Jay and I'm letting her sit this one out.
HOAG(PR): ROLL CALL!
JAY: It's too early for conscious thought!
RELENA: 03:00? I can't be witty at 03:00!
TOM: SERVO!
CROW: ROBOT!
LENA(sleepy muttering): Umm, ooh, right there Bit... *Sweatdrops all
around.*
JOK: I did it again!
TROWA: ....
JAY(about Trowa, as Andy Defrense): The silent-silent partner. He's the
guilty one Your Honor, the man with the bank accounts.
RELENA: But Quatre and I are the rich ones.

and are used without permission (please don't sue. I'm not making money on
this, and it's out of love of the characters), have encountered a darkfic
lemon that they could not MST.

JAY: Kanashii no Imi. Our ultimate goal...

He refuses to give up hope that one day, it might be accomplished, perhaps
with the aid of another MST group, as was done to Kagato's Revenge.

LENA: Good luck!
JAY: Don't get cocky just yet. Since both me and Weber-san want to MST it
I've offered to team up with him to do it.
ALL: You WHAT!?!?!?

Perhaps docking at AnimePort # 9 would help...No, Peter Suzuki would never
allow clearance to
land there, Weber-san realizes, since we've MSTed many of his works
ourselves.

JAY: We've done one and are MSTing a MST of another...

To make matters even worse, Ryga of the Wind

JAY: That's TYGER Of The Wind!

will no longer aid him, claiming he's tired of the burnt fur from all of his
encounters with Prince Vegeta.

JOK: Stupid monkey. *WHAM!* Why'd ya do that?
JAY: One of my best friends happens to be a Taljin, and Taljinians just so
happen to have monkey-like tails as well!

Weber-san finds himself short a member.

CROW: Now that just ain't right!

He knows of only one person who can aid him, and he turns to her now.

TOM: Glyph Bellchime?
*The ship shudders.*
HOAG(PR): Listen mate, this bleedin' hunk of metal might have fourth wall
shields so we don't get damaged by crossing continualities, but that's
pushing it!

The new line up:
Zechs Merquise: The sane one.

RELENA: My brother...

Vegeta: The violent one.

JAY: Fellow royalty...

Ryoko: The fiesty one.

CROW: Washu's daughter...

and introducing:

Rei Ayanami: The silent type.

TOM: I was wrong.

Weber-san: You guys know the drill.

*Wordlessly, Lena holds up a Dremel.*
JAY: Obscure...

I want a clean MST of the following fic. And since Rei's new, we'll avoid
the usual crap.
Vegeta: Oh, sure, take it easy on her. I see how this works.
Weber-san: Hentai mind out of the gutter, Saiya-jin. She's sacred to me. I'd
never touch her.

CROW: Now drooling over her naked body on the other hand...

Zechs: Considering her age, that's a good thing.
Weber-san: Him I can understand, but e tu, Zechs?

JAY(Zechs as Andy Griffith doing Brutus): Yeah, me too.
LENA: And I thought I was being obscure...

Zechs: Naturally.
Ryoko:(eyeing Rei): She reminds me of someone...
Rei: I am ready.
Weber-san: Then without further ado, I give you...

CROW: ...A hicky.
RELENA: Jay, if that's the quality of his jokes, let's go back to sleep and
do this MST later...

A Tenchi Muyo Fan Fiction.
Ruby Red, Cat-Like, Eyes.
By Peter Suzuki.

Vegeta: OH NO! Not a Suzuki fic again!
Ryoko: Ugh. That whole "Passion Satisfying, Ground Shaking, Glass
Breaking..." thing.

JAY: THAT was NOT cute, Peter, there is no way a Sasami lemon can be cute!

Rei: I have heard that Mr. Suzuki is a fellow MSTer who hates Tank Cop with
a passion.

RELENA: Yes, in fact between Peter, Ksa, and Jay, me, and Washu, Tank Cop
has been pretty well taken care of.
LENA: What?
JAY: Peter and Ksa destroyed an astroid in which Dr. Wheelo had stored the
worst TC fanfics...
RELENA: ...And we destroyed Tank Cop himself.

Ryoko: Why does that matter to you?
Rei: I have been on the recieving end of Tank Cop's perversity.
Ryoko: No wonder you're so pensive.
Zechs: Can we get on with it, please?

The series "Tenchi Muyo" is owned by Pioneer LDC, AIC, and their
contributors. All rights reserved.

WARNING: Some of you are going to hate me for this one.

Vegeta: Don't worry, Suzuki. If they didn't hate you for the Sasami thing,
or your merciless MSTs, then nothing can make them hate you.

TROWA: Agreed.

Rei: I will if Weber-san orders me to.
Weber-san: (light reflecting on glasses, gloved hands folded in front of
him): That won't be necessary at this time.
Zechs: That's creepy, how you do that.

JAY: Easily. *Light reflects off his sunglasses.* It's a trick of the trade.

Ryoko: You ain't kiddin'.

May contain some language, and situations, not suitable for younger readers.

TOM: Why do some people think age=maturity?
JOK: They never seen Brock chase after girls, maybe?
TOM: Yeah.

Zechs: That's why we found it in the Lemon Section, right.
Vegeta: If it's Sasami again...
Ryoko: I'll kill him if it is.

RELENA: Only if you can beat us to it.

Rei: ...

############################################################################

It was a bright and sunny morning. The fish were swimming in the lake, the
birds were chirping, small furry animals were running around the trees.

JOK: What? A non-stereotypical Tenchi fic?
JAY: Believe me, with Peter, ANYTHING can and WILL happen... *pause* I know
seeing those animals makes you hungry Koeing. Just tell Skuld and Brick you
want to eat some rabbits.
LENA: What the?!
RELENA: He shares an almost psychic connection with his organoid partner,
they can sometimes see what the other sees.
LENA: Ah.

Vegeta: Look! It's a Suzuki story that doesn't take place at 4 in the
morning!
Ryoko: My, how peaceful it seems.

"AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"

Rei: I believe that you spoke too soon, Ryoko-san.

All of which were scared away, by the stone shattering screams of a young
woman in immense pain.

TOM: We know the truth hurts Aeka, the truth is that Tenchi loves Ryoko, but
you don't need to scream.

Zechs: Epyon is standing by for launch, should we need to squish a lemon
writer.

CROW: How can both Zechs and Jay have Epyon.
JAY: His is the one from the show, mine is the one from the game Endless
Duel.

Rei: Unit 00 will back you up.

"GET THIS F*&%$%G THING OUT OF ME!!!!!!!"

Vegeta: o_0
Ryoko: Oh, we are NOT off to a good start here.

JOK: Motion seconded...
LENA: And carried.
CROW: HOW COME JOK AND LENA AND JAY AND RELENA ARE ALWAYS FINISHING EACH
OTHER'S SENTENCE OR SAYING THINGS AT THE SAME TIME!??!?!?!
RELENA: Jay and I just know what the other is going to say, I can't explain
Jok and Lena...

In the Masaki home, several people were by the closet door that led to
Washu's lab, where the sounds of pain, and anger were coming from.

Zechs:(as Washuu): Oh come now, anal probes don't hurt that much!

*Males get sick*

Vegeta: Zechs, no male should ever, under any circumstances, utter that
line.

JAY(green): Preach it!

Tenchi covered Sasami's ears.

All except Rei: HALLELUJA! Sasami's not in the lemony parts!

*AniMSTers join in rejoicing.*

Rei: She reminds me of someone...someone I know.

Sasami covered Ryo-oh-ki's ears.

TOM: You'd need a blanket to do that.

Mihoshi and Kiyone stared at the door, terror expressed on their faces. The
three rulers of Jurai sat on the couch. Misaki was covering her mouth,
Funaho was covering her ears, and Azusa had his face buried in his hands.

JOK: Almost looks like those three monkeys statues.

Yosho continued saying prayers to the spirits. And Nobuyuki made sure that
the earplugs were secure in Mayuka's ears.

Zechs: Hey, aside from Washuu, who's missing?

JOK: Ryoko, Aeka, Azaka, Kamidake, Mitsuki... *Smiles evilly at Jay* Sakura.
JAY: IiE sHiN tEnChI! ShIn TeNcHi IbEr!!!

Vegeta: It's either Ayeka or Ryoko.
Rei: They don't sound like Ryoko. The noise is too high pitched.

TOM: That rules out the ‘Jurian Naga the Serpent' too.
LENA: But she's also the ‘Alien Smurfette'!
CROW: Depends on whether this is the Japanese or the American version.
JAY: WeberMST reference.

Ryoko: Those screams don't SOUND like Ayeka. They sound like Linda Blair!

"GYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! S#******************T!!!!"
The screams continued.

Zechs: Suzuki is censoring his own fic?
Vegeta: Why not? We all wish he'd censored that other one.
Ryoko: This is not normal. Something is very wrong here.

LENA: What she said.

And in the lab, Nurse Washu was working on her most important project yet.
"Good." Said Washu, checking her watch. "The contractions are about a minute
apart."

JOK: I do not see any contractions.

Delivering a baby.

Rei: Ikari-kun told me that I reminded him of a mother. I was...embarrassed.
Ryoko: Do you ever alter your tone or speak in anything other than a
whisper?

JAY: No, when she gets mad, she just destroys a planet.

Vegeta: DON'T PUSH HER! You saw the End of Evangelion, didn't you?
Ryoko: No. Why?
Vegeta (whispers into Ryoko's ear)

LENA(Ryoko): NO VEGETA, I WILL NOT SLEEP WITH YOU!!!

Ryoko starts: NO WAY! HER?

"NO S#*T!!!" screamed the mother-to-be. "GET IT OUT OF ME, ALREADY!!!!"

Zechs: Didn't this play out in The Fly 2?

She tugged on the restraints that were on her arms and legs,

CROW: Ooh, bondage...

set there to keep her from hurting herself.
Washu adjusted her goggles, and straightened her face mask. "Would you like
for the 'Father' to be present for this? After all, it is-"

Vegeta: Why is 'Father' in quotation marks?
Ryoko: I don't know, but I'm worried.
Rei: Worried why?
Zechs: This is suspicious.

"OF COURSE I WANT THAT A$$^^%^@# TO BE HERE, SO I CAN [ Due to the graphic

Oh, the heck with it. I'll just skip to the end of it. Peter Suzuki.]"

ALL: THERE'S MORE!?!?!

Vegeta: What? You mean, it goes on?
Ryoko: Almost as foul mouthed as you, huh, Vegeta?
Rei: Or Asuka.

"My, such language." Washu muttered, as she began to walk to the door.
"I'll be back in a moment, so try not to hurt yourself. Okay, Ayeka?"

Ryoko: If Tenchi got her pregnant, I'll kill him.
Vegeta: Oh grow up.
Ryoko:(brandishes sword) : Gonna make me?
Vegeta: For all you know, it was Yosho, anyway. Besides, what if it was
Tenchi? So what. Find another man.
Rei: Love is more sacred than that.

JAY(Smiling at Relena): I'll drink to that.

Ryoko(in shock) : Did you say "love"?
Rei: Yes. For I know what love is. And I wish to unite with Ikari-kun.
Zechs: Um, aren't you both just a little young for that?
Vegeta: Oh, like Dorothy Catalonia wasn't a bit underage?

JOK: Or Noin?

Zechs: I'll have you know that absolutely nothing happened between me and
her.

CROW: Nothing below R-Rated that is.

Ryoko(as Clinton): I did not have sexual relations with the cousin of my
enemy...
Zechs: You're both rotten to the core.
Rei: No, it is merely the absence of each other that causes them to be this
way. That is what Gendou-san wishes to fix.

JAY: What did she just say?

Other: @_@;

The first princess of Jurai let out another scream of pain, that sent all of
the creatures in Washu's lab running away in fear.

Vegeta: A task made even more amazing by the fact that they're all in
specimen jars!

TROWA: And that they are sperm samples.

Washu poked her head out the door, and pulled down her face mask.
"Tenchi?"

Ryoko: (draws sword again): He's DEAD!

"Yes, Miss Washu?" replied Tenchi.
"Where is she?" Washu asked.
"In my room pacing back and forth, the last time I saw her." said Tenchi.
"Go get her. It's almost time." Said Washu, as she turned back toward her
lab.

TOM: The sun is setting, Twilight Suzuka is coming to kill her.

Ryoko: Wait, go get "her"? I thought Washuu wanted the father.

Tenchi looked uncertain. "Are you sure that's wise, Washu? The last time
Ayeka saw her, she. . ." Tenchi did not want to verbally repeat what Ayeka
had said, or did.

Vegeta: We've said it before, and we'll say it again. Tenchi, grow a pair.

LENA: So have I.
JOK: That might be interpreted the wrong way. :>

"Don't worry. Everything will be-"
Washu was cut off

TOM: HOW?

as Ayeka's scream erupted from the lab.
"AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!
FU@$$#%^&&**^^%$#@$$^&**&^%@@#$%^&*&^%$#@#%^&***^%###%%$%^^&&%%##@@$#$%^&^$$^%%%&&*((**&$$!@#$%%$%#$^^$$^&&**((&*&%$#&^$##%^&*#&%?%%#*(&&^*^^%$&%&^$%^%#&%*(*(%^%%#
WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!!!!!!!"

ALL: *Shocked*

Zechs: I didn't even know she knew words like that!!!
Rei: I take back my earlier assessment. Not even Asuka is that unruly.

"Just trust me, okay!" Washu blurted out, almost too quickly.
"Don't worry, Ayeka!! I'll help, don't worry!!" Said Washu, as she went back
into her lab. Everybody mentally noted that Washu had to be one of the
bravest people they had ever known.

JOK: She's either incredibly brave...
RELENA/LENA/JAY: Or incredibly stupid.
WASHU(O.S.) I HEARD THAT! *A giant anvil falls on the four.*

Vegeta: Nah. She's just had kids of her own.
Ryoko: This coming from a "model" parent.
Vegeta: Hey! How I beat...er...raise my kids is no consequence of yours!
Rei: I have no mother.
Others: Awwwwwww.

"I'll go get her." Tenchi mumbled, as he went back to his room to fetch the
'Father'-to-be.

Ryoko: Wait, the "father to be" is a she? This has to be Washuu's doing!

TOM: Why's that?

Zechs: Didn't you claim everyone was quick to blame your mother in that
Sasami thing we MSTed?
Ryoko: This one is a scientific impossiblity! Only Washuu can do that!
Vegeta: (evil grin on face): I just remembered who else was absent from the
room!

JAY: Everyone who wasn't in the room?

Said parent was now sitting on the floor of Tenchi's room, nervously eating
M&M's. The pile of multicolored, candy shells beside her proved this.

Rei: What does the milk candy that melts in your mouth and not in your hands
have to do with planned parenting?

RELENA: What do they have to do with ANY parenting?

Vegeta(evil grin broadening): Oh, I don't think this was planned!

Tenchi quietly opened the door, and spoke to the nervous woman inside.
"Ryoko. Washu says that she wants you back in the lab now."

LENA: YURI IS EVIL!!!
JAY: Oh? Is that what you were thinking when you were in the shower with
Naomi?
LENA(shocked): How... how did you know about that?!
JAY(Smug): Zoids Doujinshi.
JOK(to Relena): You're not upset with Jay looking at other girls?
RELENA(to Jok): As long as he don't touch, I have no problem. The day he
touches though...

Zechs and Ryoko facefault.
Vegeta: MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Rei (turns shade of green): That was unexpected.

Ryoko looked up from the floor. Her face was abnormally pale.
"A-are you sure it's all right?" said Ryoko, sounding uncharacteristically
timid.

Ryoko: TIMID! LET ME AT SUZUKI, AND I'LL SHOW HIM HOW TIMID I CAN BE!!!!!!!

CROW: VERY timid if it would get you in bed with Tenchi.

Vegeta: Oh, you new parents are always so nervous. You'll get used to it.
Ryoko: I WILL kill you, Vegeta. You know that, don't you?! I will KILL you.

"After what happened last time I. . ."

TROWA(Ryoko): Would rather die than face her.

"It's okay now." Said Tenchi. "Her head stopped spinning an hour ago, and
she hasn't breathed fire for a while."

TROWA(Tenchi): Although the last time she did, she destroyed Azaka and
Kamidake.

All: -_-"

Although he mentally noted that he did not know if Ayeka's eyes were still
glowing, or not.

Rei: I think she has very nice eyes. They are quite beautiful, in a way.

Ryoko stood up, and took in a deep breath. "Okay." she said, mustering up
all of her courage. "Let's go."

JAY: The whole ounce.

Ryoko and Tenchi entered the lab. The cyan-hared

Vegeta: OK, the mysterious cyan-hare makes its appearance.

TOM(Typical Pokemon trainer): I'LL CATCH IT!

Zechs: I think by now we all know it's a spelling error.
Rei: The appropriate spelling being "haired".

woman carefully approached the bed, where Ayeka lay. The princess was NOT
happy to see her.

Zechs: When is she ever?

LENA: When she got pregnant.

Vegeta: Well, about nine months ago...
Ryoko: DIE SAIYA-JIN SCUM!!!! (Ryoko throws several bolts at Vegeta)
The smoke clears to reveal Vegeta perfectly fine, a barrier of ki between
him and Ryoko. Rei sits in her seat, unfazed, and Zechs has taken up a
defensive stance behind the counch.

"It is about time that you showed up!!!" Ayeka yelled at Ryoko, before
letting out another scream of pain. "AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!! THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, RYOKO!!!!!!!"

JAY(Ryoko): WELL IF YOU HADN'T LET ME FUCK YOU!!!

Vegeta rolls in the aisles, laughing his ass off.

RELENA: That's an interesting sight...

Ryoko winced, from the force of Ayeka's scream.

JAY(Impressed): She knows the Soundwave Blaster attack?!

"N-now Ayeka, I'm here to help you if you need me for anything." Ryoko
managed to say.

Ryoko: I said it in the Sasami MST, and I'm saying it here! I DO NOT SWING
THAT WAY!
Vegeta: Come off it. We all saw the scene in Tenchi Universe where Sasami
shot you two with the Lesbian Arrows of Love.

TOM: It was Pretty Sammy who shot the arrows actually.
CROW: Nitpicker...

Ryoko: THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS CALLED, DAMN IT!
Vegeta: Surrrrrrre.
Weber-san: You have to admit, Ryoko, it looked pretty...um...affectionate.

JOK: I though so too.

Ryoko: I...willl....kill....you....all.

TROWA(Ryoko as Black Waltz #3): I exist only to kill!

Vegeta: Popcorn, Rei?
Rei: (blushes): Thank you.
Ryoko (as Cartman): Kill you guys...Kill you guys...

"You want to help me? Fine! Bring your neck over here so I can break
something!!!" Ayeka remarked, in a too sweet tone.

LENA: I know that tone well...
JAY: Yeah, you use it with Bit.

Vegeta: I've been around Bulma long enough to know THAT tone. That tone
means trouble.

"This is all your fault that this happened to me, Miss 'Able to change her
gender'!!!

RELENA: Fanboys?
TOM/JAY Not that we know of...

Zechs: Ryoko?
Ryoko: Uh....Not that I know of...

CROW: Exactly what she said.

Rei: Kaurou and I are one in the same. Gender is meaningless.
Vegeta: That's probably what Tank Cop thought when he wrote that one yuri
fic....
Zechs: Ugh.
Rei: Hmmmmm. You have a point.

AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGH!!!! I HATE YOU, RYOKO!!!!! I CAN'T BELEVE I DIDN'T TRY TO
KILL YOU WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!"

Vegeta: We always hurt the ones we love.

JAY: Even if we don't know it...
JOK: ???
RELENA: AJ?
JAY: AJ.
JOK: Who?
JAY: AJ, Prince of Talji and the Dark Guyver, is in love with this girl-
RELENA: Call her "Ellone".
JAY: -Although she doesn't know.
RELENA: And everytime she goes out with a guy...
JAY: Or falls in love with someone who will hurt her...
RELENA: It tears his heart ashunder.

Ryoko: I hate you.
Vegeta: ^_^, I know.

"You hate her? That's not what you were screaming to her, nine months ago."

JOK: Somebody gonna die today, Jay.

Vegeta: Heeheeheeheehee!
Zechs: Oh, now somebody's gonna get it for that one.

All other heads turned toward the one who said that.
"Um. . . I think I'll go out, and see how everyone else is doing." Said
Tenchi, as he tried to avoid the confused stare of Washu, the shocked stare
of Ryoko, and the death promising stare coming from Ayeka.

JAY: And the surprised gaping of the AniMSTers...

Zechs: You mean, he watched?
Vegeta: Wouldn't you?

MALES(Minus Trowa): Yeah...

Zechs: You know, Noin's been spending alot of time with that Sally Po chick
now that she thinks I'm dead...
Vegeta: And then there's all those fics about your "friendship" with Treize.
Zechs: Oh. And how about the ones with you and Goku.
Vegeta: I think we'd best leave those alone.
Zechs: That's what I thought.

LENA: NEVER start something you can't finish!

After Tenchi left the lab, Ayeka and Ryoko returned to their. .
conversation. "I can't believe that you did this to me, Ryoko!!!"

Rei: I think Ryoko is just as dumfounded.

RELENA(Rei): And I think she is dumbfounded as well...

"Now, Ayeka." Scolded Washu. "Ryoko didn't know that she would get you
pregnant. Even I didn't realize she could alter her gender to that level."

JAY: As far as I know, she can't alter it AT ALL!

Zechs: So, like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, there must have been frog
DNA in Ryoko. So when she spent too long in an environment that was mostly
female, she became male!

JOK: Interesting theory...

Ryoko: Zechs, I can kill you, you know. And it'll hurt when I do it.

TROWA: Heero once told me something, "Death hurts like hell."

"That is beside the point!!!" Ayeka screamed back. "She took advantage of
me, while I was drunk!!!"

CROW: You were BOTH under the table!

Vegeta: Knowing her, you were BOTH soused at the time.

Ryoko wanted to comment that they were both stone drunk,

TOM: And it's three strikes...

Vegeta: Told ya.

and that Ayeka did not resist the entire ordeal at all, but seeing as how
Ayeka was ripping the double reinforced, titanium restraints from the
ground, she decided not to voice it.

JAY: *Scoffs* THAT is all she's doing? PATH-ETIC!

Vegeta: Oh wuss. Wuss!
Ryoko: (puts her sword to Vegeta's throat): Were you saying something?

JAY(Vegeta): I said you were a WUSS!!!

Then Ayeka began to scream in pain, again.
"GYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! IT HURTS!!!! IT HURTS!!!!"

"She's going into final contractions!!" Washu yelled over the noise.
"The baby's coming out!!"

Washu went to work, and Ryoko rushed over to Ayeka's bedside. Ayeka obliged
Ryoko's concern by taking Ryoko's hand into her own, and crushing it with
the force of a full garbage truck running over an ant.

RELENA: *Blinks* She must be holding back...
CROW: See? They WERE Lesbian Arrows of Love!

Vegeta: That's about half the force I used on those cretins guarding
Frieza's ship. It's a satisfying feeling, I can tell you.

JAY: Don't have to tell me...
LENA: Or me.
JAY(To Lena): By the way, Wolf Warrior Total Assault is better than Wild
Weasel Unit Total Assault!
LENA: Is not!
JAY: Are too!
LENA: Is not!
JAY: Oh yeah? How about me as the Wolf Warrior versus you and your Gunsniper
tomorrow?
LENA: YOU'RE ON!!!

The sound of bones breaking were muffled by Ayeka's screaming.
"I can see the baby's head!!" said Washu. "How are things up there,
Ryoko!?!"
". . ." Ryoko was in too much pain to comment, as Ayeka folded her hand
over, and crushed it again.

RELENA(Ryoko as a soldier): MEDIC!

"Ryoko, is everything all right!?!" asked Washu.
"Oh, yeAh. EvEryThINg FinE!!" Was Ryoko's rather strangled, mental reply.
"HurRy uP WiTh deLIvEry, plEaSe!!"

RELENA: She sounds like Jay does when the sequel to Universe is mentioned.

Outside the laboratory, everybody else listened closely to the door, waiting
for any sign that it was safe to go in. Unfortunately, the only sounds that
they could hear were Ayeka's screaming, and the occasional comment from
Washu. Then, after a tense minute of silence, a new sound came from the lab.

TOM[Heart Monitor]: BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
LENA(Washu): I regret to inform you that Aeka died in childbirth.

"WHAAAAA!!! WHAAAAA!!!"

JOK: Low pain threshold...

Vegeta: Oh come now, Ryoko. It can't hurt THAT badly.

"Hey!" exclaimed Sasami. "That's not Ayeka's voice!"
"Congratulations." Washu could be heard from behind the door. "It's a girl."

CROW(Aeka): We've decided to name her ‘Tenchi Misaki'.
ALL: *Snicker*

Rei: I will name her George, and I will love her and pat her and hold her
and squeeze her...
Vegeta: Um, Rei. Please don't do that. You're scaring us.

JAY: And US.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And so, After the cutting of the umbilical cord, which Ryoko had to use a
pair of LEFT handed scissors for, the parents and their child quietly
contemplated what had just happened.

JAY(stoned Aeka): What the hell just happened? Why am I holding a baby?

CROW(stoned Ryoko): I don't know, I was bouldered.
JAY(stoned Aeka): Don'tcha mean stoned?
CROW(stoned Ryoko): No, I was WAY past stoned...

Zechs: They always wait until it's over to contemplate. If they thought
about it before hand, there wouldn't be any problems like this.

"So, um. . . How are you feeling, Ayeka?" asked Ryoko, trying not to use her
bandaged hand too much.

RELENA(Aeka): Like I just gave birth... Oh wait, I DID JUST GIVE BIRTH!!!

"Tired. Very, tired." Replied Ayeka, gently cradling her newborn daughter in
her arms.

"You know. . ." Ryoko tried to find the right words to say. "I never
expected my first child to be born like this."

Vegeta: Gee, ya think?

LENA(Ryoko): Nope, I try not to think unless it's about getting in Tenchi's
pants.
JOK: But they're a little big for you!
*Rimshot*

"Nor did I." Said Ayeka. "But, all things considered, I guess it turnedout
well." Ayeka smirked. "It could have been that idiot, Seriyou for all it was
worth."

Ryoko: It should have been!

Ryoko thought about that for a moment. "I don't think I could get him
pregnant, even if I tried."

Vegeta: On the contrary, I have proof that Seriyou is actually the adult
form of Chibi-Usa!

RELENA: Where did he get that?
JAY: From me. And as for where I got it, I have my connections...

Zechs: When the Sailor Moon fans flame you, I want to watch.
LENA: I'd rather use him as a heater.
*rimshot*

Both of them laughed as loudly as they dared, trying not to wake their
daughter.

Ayeka decided to bring up a serious topic. "So, what is going to happen
now?"

TROWA(Ryoko as Heero): "Omae o korosu."

Ryoko: I am not hearing this. LALALALALALALALALALALALALA.....

"You mean, besides the fact that we're both going to have to marry Tenchi,
now?"

JOK: Question: Why didn't they do that in the first place and get it over
with?

They both managed to only snicker. "I guess we may as well try to raise her
as a family. . .although considering who's in our family, I think we're
going to have our hands full."

Vegeta: Oh come off it. You've already got one heck of a babysitter if you
two decide to work on a second kid.
Ryoko mallets Vegeta.

"I agree." Said Ayeka. "Your mother. . ." Ayeka waited for any denials of
relation to Washu. There were none. "Seemed to take it quite well." The
princess scowled. "Then again, considering what she has done before, I don't
think she finds THIS as being too unusual." Ayeka then became more
concerned. "But my father may be another matter entirely. He was angry
enough when he thought that it was Lord-Tenchi who impregnated me. . ."

TOM: Nothing good...

Zechs(as Azuza): I expect you to do the right thing by my daughter.
Vegeta(as Tenchi): Yessir. I'll marry her right away!
Zechs(as Azuza): I meant kill yourself, earthling worm!

JAY(as Tenchi): Sir, me being such a worm is why your daughter is after me
like a bird looking for lunch.

Ryoko nodded in agreement with that. "He still hasn't said anything about it
being US, yet." Ryoko grimaced. "But the way he's been glaring at me, I
think he doesn't like it."

Vegeta: Oh that's just the father in him. No Dad approves of the person who
impregnates his daughter. And Ryoko does have that immense criminal
record...

Ryoko then looked deeply into Ayeka's eyes.

RELENA(Ryoko): HELP! I'M DROWNING IN AYEKA'S EYES!!!

"But what he thinks will not change how I feel about this."
"And. . .how do you feel, about this?" Ayeka asked.
Ryoko smiled. "I don't mind one bit. I think that as far as mothers go, our
daughter is lucky to have you."

Rei(baby as Cartman): But I wanna know who my father is...

JAY(Baby as a young girl): Mom, what's a lesbian?
CROW(Aeka): Go ask your father, dear.
JAY(Baby as a young girl): Dad, what's a lesbian?
TOM(Ryoko): It's like your mother and me...

Ayeka smiled, and blushed slightly. Her expression then turned a little sad.
"Ryoko. . .about what I said to you earlier. . .while I was in labor..."

Ryoko put her index finger up to Ayeka's lips. "I know you didn't mean
what you said. I understand that it was the pain talking." She then heldup
her cast. "But it wasn't necessary to SHARE that pain with me, Ayeka."

Vegeta: Phhh! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Delivery room humor. How I hate it.

Ayeka tried her best not to laugh, but her chuckling woke up the sleeping
girl in her arms. The newborn looked up into the faces of her parents, with
wonder and innocence showing brightly in her eyes.

LENA: But I thought it was Ryoko and Aeka's child, not MIHOSHI and Aeka's...

The shape inherited from Ryoko's cat like eyes, and the color from Ayeka's
ruby colored
eyes.

RELENA: Hence the title.

She did the only thing she could really think of doing.

JAY: She committed seppeku.

Both parents were slightly surprised when their daughter started laughing
along with them, in a laugh that sounded startlingly like Ayeka's usual
cackle.

TOM: Guess that confirms that this is the Japanese version.

But they both smiled, and enjoyed the time with their daughter.

Zechs: I wonder what color her hair will be?
Vegeta: Look next to you, Zechs. Your sitting beside her.
Rei: ....
Vegeta: Seriously! Look, long, eliptical eyes, ruby red color, blue hair,
similar to Sasami...Rei Ayanami is the love child of Ryoko and Ayeka!

JAY: He's got valid points.

Rei (hugs Ryoko): MOTHER! I've found you at last!
Ryoko: (looks at contented Rei, then at Vegeta): You will pay for this,
Vegeta! God in Heaven as my witness, you WILL pay!

GOD(Heaven, Booming voice): I HEREBY WITNESS THE OATH THAT RYOKO WILL KILL
VEGETA.

*and a merry sweatdrop to all*

Ayeka and her daughter fell asleep together on the bed,

CROW: Just born and already getting into the hot female sex with her?
WHAM! WHAM!
ROUGA FUUFUU KEN!
BZZZT! (Jok using a tazer.)

and Ryoko watched protectively over them. Ready for the challenges that
tomorrow would bring. And for one brief moment, all was right with the
world.

Zechs: Sounds like the end of Gundam Wing, until Endless Waltz comes along.

THE END,

ALL: DOMO ARIGATO, KAMI-SAMA!!!!

FOR NOW.

ALL: IIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

#####################################################################################

AUTHOR'S NOTES:
No flames, please.

JAY: Two words Peter:
RELENA: Dream.
JAY: On.

I tried to get a tender, heartfelt scene in the end, so it wasn't all bad.

Vegeta: A Suzuki fic I actually liked.
Ryoko: YOU would. REI! I am NOT your mother!

CROW: She's right.

Rei: Oh, that's right. DADDY!

CROW: SHE's right.

Ryoko: =>_<=, Rei, I am going to count to three, and if you don't unhand me,
you will find it very unpleasant.

Okay, now for the crazy rant. . . BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!! I DID IT AGAIN!!!

JOK: HEY! That's MY line!

It's been thought of, suggested, mentioned, and threatened, BUT only from
the writer who gave you such twisted stories as "A Secret Confession."

LENA: Never read it.

And "A Passion Satisfying,Ground Shaking, Glass Breaking. . ."

JAY: Being a fellow MSTer is all that keeps you from my retribution for that
one...

are you given a Fan Fic where Ryoko and Ayeka actually have a child!!!

Vegeta: So we have you to blame for Evangelion, huh?
Zechs: I thought you liked Eva?
Vegeta: I do, sort of. But the end was too trippy for me.
Weber-san: Well, I WAS going to show you Serial Experiments Lain, but I'll
pass now.
Ryoko: 1

What's next for me!?! I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!! Maybe I'll write a story where
Nagi falls in love with Tenchi!

TOM(To Jay): You should do that...

Maybe I'll write a Fic where Kagato is the HERO!!

Weber-san: I have to remember that idea, and then blame Suzuki for it when I
write it.
Ryoko: 2.

JOK(Hawkeye): Showing off for your daughter, Ryoko?

Heck, I'll have Sasami fall in love with him just for fun!

RELENA: If she isn't over 18, 21 preferably, you WILL face grievous injury!

How about an alternate universe of the first TV series, where Ryoko gets
amnesia from her crash, and becomes this overly sweet, very lovable
girl!?!?!

Ryoko: (stops count) : WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT! I'M LOVEABLE!.
Rei: *I* love you, Dad.
Ryoko: (sighs): Weber-san, explain it to her, please?
Weber-san: I dunno. Vegeta makes a convincing arguement.

Or another alternate universe of the OAV series and the comics, where Ryoko
and Minagi are sisters from the start, and Yakage and Washu are married!?!?

CROW: Hmmm...

Maybe I'll just continue THIS story from where it left off, or someone else
will!!!! If you want to do ANY of these ideas, or if YOU want to do them
yourself, please tell me! Oh, and by the way. I was thinking that a good
name for Ayeka & Ryoko's daughter would be "Koyasha"( the name literally
means "Demon Child")

LENA: Genko, ‘Dark Woman', sort of playing off the ‘Devil Woman' insult...

Vegeta: We think Rei Ayanami is preferable.

Tell me what you think. Your constructive comments are always appreciated.
Peter Suzuki.

Ryoko: I will kill him
Weber-san: Oh come off it. You roasted Vegeta alive for that Saiya-jin one.
I thought you deserved a turn.

JAY: Warning, ANYONE sings "Turn, Turn, Turn", I WILL launch them out a
torpedo tube!

Ryoko: But now this...this girl is clinging to me!
Rei: Actually, Weber-san paid me to do that.

ALL: *Facefault, Relena and Jay don't get up.*

Gendou-san is all I know. Ikari-kun is the one I love.
Ryoko: I'll kill the lot of you.
Rei: Besides, I do have a passing resemblance to Sasami. I think it's why
Tank Cop took an unhealthy obsession with the poor girl.
Ryoko: Like his obsession with YOU is healthy.
Weber-san: I think an obsession with Rei is VERY healthy. Writing Yuri
Rei/Asuka stories is NOT.

Zechs: Anyway, to Mr. Suzuki, we could find no fault with this fic, save for
Ryoko, who is a bit biased. But then, we wonder how Ayeka at AnimePort # 9
is taking it.

Jok: Last time Xel came by, he told me and Jay she made a mad Akane look
calm.

[fic ends]
[all minus Jay and Relena exit theater]

"That was a long MST..." Lena yawned.

"Yeah." Jok replied

Trowa looked around, "Jay? Relena?"

The AniMSTers turned and looked into the theater to see their captain and
his girlfriend snuggled up together, sleeping soundly.

"Let's let them rest... Tom, would you help me for the rest of the shift?"
Hoag whispered.

"Of course." Tom replied in the same hushed tone as the others left.
