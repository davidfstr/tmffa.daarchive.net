Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Masaki number five.

One, Two, Three, Four, Five everybody in the 
cabbit so come one let's ride to the planet
'round the corner.  The girls say they want
some dis-n-dat but I really don't wanna
battle like I had last week.
I must stay deep 'cause sex is cheap.
I like Aeka, Ryoko, Kiyone, and Sasami
And what I'm gonna say will make you hate me
I can't please 'em 'cause I like to tease 'em
To me flirting is second nature 
Now I must fly, run away now
'cause the girls are here, lemme tell ya how

A little bit of Sakuya in my life,
A little bit of Aeka by my side,
A little bit of Kiyone all I need,
A little bit of Mihoshi's what I see,
A little bit of Sasami in the sun,
A little bit of Ryoko all night long,
A little bit of Washu here I am,
A little bit of you makes Tenchi yo' man!
Masaki number five.

Slash up and down and slash it all around.
Shake your sword to the sound, put your ships 
on the ground.
Take one look left and one look right,
One to the left and one to the side,
Phase yourself once and phase yourself twice
And if you find Tenchi like this, then you're
doing it right.

A little bit of Sakuya in my life,
A little bit of Aeka by my side,
A little bit of Kiyone all I need,
A little bit of Mihoshi's what I see,
A little bit of Sasami in the sun,
A little bit of Ryoko all night long,
A little bit of Washu here I am,
A little bit of you makes Tenchi yo' man!

Light Hawk, the Light hawk
Masaki number five,

A little bit of Sakuya in my life,
A little bit of Aeka by my side,
A little bit of Kiyone all I need,
A little bit of Mihoshi's what I see,
A little bit of Sasami in the sun,
A little bit of Ryoko all night long,
A little bit of Washu here I am,
A little bit of you makes Tenchi yo' man!

I do all to fall in love wit an alien like you
But you make me wanna run and hide,
You think I wanna touch the sky.
Masaki number five.
