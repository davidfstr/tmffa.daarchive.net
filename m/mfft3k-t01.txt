>[Satellite of Slight Insecurity.  
Aries sits on a chair wondering how she got to be in her current 
situation.]

>Aries: "Why me?"
>Voice: "Why not?"

>[A screen drops from the ceiling on a far wall.  On it, an image begins 
to appear]

>Aries: "And you would be?"
>Voice: "Uh... you didn't read the script?"
>Aries: "Script?"
>Voice: "It's in the side table right there."

>[Aries rummages thought the side table until she finds a sheet of paper 
with a few notes scribbled on it]

>Aries: "This thing?   You call this a script?"
>Voice: "Well, we went a little over budget with the flat TV screen and 
the satellite hook up, but... Oh never mind that"
>Aries: "It says here that your Kefka.  A sly and maniacal villain from 
Final Fantasy 6 who delights in causing pain and suffering and once 
ruled the world with...  Hey, you wrote this didn't you!?!
>Kefka: "That's not important.  The important thing is that I, Kefka, 
have devised a way to transport characters from Final Fantasy games to 
this orbiting satellite to test my amazing new mind control techniques."
>Aries: "So, why am I all alone?"
>Kefka: "I'm getting to that!  Hold on a second!"

>[Kefka reaches down to push a button.  Three shapes appear on the far 
side of the room]

>Aries: "So you can waste money on your cool StarTrek-y transportation 
thing, but this is the best you can do for a script!?!"
>Kefka: "Just shut up for a second, will ya."

>[The dazed travelers make their way to the table Aries is sitting at.  
They are all slightly confused as to how and why they are there]

>Kefka: "Now that you are all here we can begin.  This is my new 
'Satellite of Slight Insecurity'.  You are here to test the 
effectiveness of my new mind control system.  I chose you each for your 
own unique abilities"
>Aries: "I think he just chose us at random."
>Kefka(whiney): "No I didn't!!"

>Kefka: " I believe that you should know your fellow captives, so here 
it goes... 'Rydia' from FF4 is the last of the callers of Mist village.  
'Relm' is a young girl from a hidden mage village in FF6.  'Aries' is 
the last of the ancients from FF7.  And 'Vivi' is a young Black Mage 
from FF9.  But, none of you is more powerful than I am, so there."
>All: "Great background info Kef!"
>Kefka: "Ha, you mock me now, but soon you will know the true face of 
evil"
>Relm: "So Kefka, you think you can trick me like you did Gramps?  Well 
give it your best shot"
>Kefka: "I plan to.  See, you'll love my new way to break spirited 
youths such as yourself.  You will be forced to read horrid fanfics 
until you snap.  Muahahahahahahahahahaha...
>Vivi: "Is that all?  I survived living through the destruction of half 
the populated world while doubting my own existence, and you think that 
a fanfic will crack me?
>Kefka: "Um... Well... we'll see how long you can last."

>[A light begins to flash.  The new crew of the SoSI just stares at it.]

>Kefka: "That light means that you have to enter the door to your left."

>[Everyone groans and walks through the door and onto a conveyor belt]

>[Doors emerge in sequence]
>[6..................Large sheet of ice...................Vivi casts 
Fire and continues]
>[5..................Wall of fire appears................Rydia summons 
Leviathan]
>[4..................Medusa blocks the path..........Relm sketches.  The 
gorgons turn to stone]
>[3..................Sephiroth appears...................Aries scares 
him away with her flesh wound]
>[2..................Disco lights fill the hall...........All dance to 
next door]
>[1..................Veil of mist appears................Relm and Vivi 
will it away]
>[Door to theater opens and everyone walks in with puzzled looks upon 
their faces]

>Kefka: "Before you ask, my special text-to-speech device allows for you 
to hear the action being described.  Hope you enjoy the show."
>Aries(mumbling to herself): "Cheep script-less bastard"

>[Everyone makes their way to their seats.  The screen blinks a few 
times and a test pattern is displayed]

>Relm: "Did anyone bring popcorn?"
>Rydia: "It's not that kind of movie."
>Vivi: "Here, I got some."

>[Vivi pulls a bag of popcorn from his cloak and heats it with a weak 
fire spell]

>[The PA system spouts a warning about magic use and the movie begins]

>Relm: "Alright, no stinkin' previews"
>Rydia: "You're way too excited about this."

This is a Tenchi Muyo Hentai/Lemon Fanfic of the wildest  
type!

>Aries: "'Rouge Lemons,' Tonight on the 10:00 news"
 
This is DEFENTLY not for children!

>Aries: "Uh.. How old are you guys?"
>Vivi: "Nine, but a mature nine"
>Relm: "I'm Eleven, but I had to deal with this psychotic clown before, 
so it's cool
>Rydia: "I just want to leave... Now."
 
Wait a sec..... If u were a child any way. 
YOU PROBABLY WOULDNT UNDERSTAND 
THIS AT ALL SO WHY IS THERE A  
"WARNING" IN THE FIRST PLACE???

>Vivi: "Hey, I resent that statement.  I understand... Hey, what is he 
talking about?"
>Aries: "You'll find out soon enough."

Part 1 of the "No Need For Virgins" Lemon fan/fic series. 
                         *Virgins No More* 
                        By: AncientYUME 
               Featuring Tenchi and Sasami! 
>All: "Bleh"
>Aries: "Did it say 'part 1?'"
>Rydia: "There's more!?!"
>Relm: "Hey, come on, we can do this.  Just take it one step at a time." 
 
   The sun rose once morning upon the Masaki Home. The sharp  
beams of light glared through the windows of the eastern  
side of the household. 

>Rydia: "And sliced them all to ribbons."
>Vivi: "It just started.  Wait a little while before you kill everyone"

Tenchi was awoken by the light as a little beamed through his curtains. 

>Aries(A Little): "Damn curtains; always blocking my view of Tenchi"
He refused to open his eyes and come to accept he had awoken from his 
dream. This  
dream had been like no other, he imagined Ryoko and Ayeka  
fighting,

>Relm: "Gasp!!!"

 yes that seems normal but.... He also made love to  
them later in the same dream. A threesome, and what a burst  
of pleasure he had. He had never felt such pleasure before.  
He never could have imagined actually having sex with them,  
both at the same time!! He did though; he imagined it all  
night, and it left him wet. For it was his first wet dream.

>Aries: "At the age of 17... Damn this guy is sad"
 
  He opened his eyes. The sun blinded him, for his eyes  
failed to adjust in time!

>Rydia(Sun): "Muahaha, burn you insolent eyes.  BURN!!! 
 
*Wow, what a dream. I never thought i would ever even think  
such a deed* Tenchi thought to himself. 
 He rubbed his head and pulled off the covers. His pants  
warm and wet. *Damn, i got to shower now* 
So he stood up and grabbed a few clothes and headed off the  
shower, still trying to grasp the quickly fading dream of  
the joy of sex! 
 
 Sasami was hard at work making a light breakfast! She was  
humming as she went along; steering batter, rolling dow, and  
chopping fruit.

>Vivi: "As Ayeka was stirring the batter and rolling the dough."
>Aries(Ayeka): "Really Sasami! cant you do anything right?"

 Tenchi came down the stairway and smelt the  
aroma of Sasami's typical handy work. He was shower robe 

>Rydia(Tenchi): "Damn that Washu and her crazy experiments"

and he was drying his hair with a towel. 
 
"Oh Tenchi good morning!" Sasami shouted with glee as she  
saw Tenchi heading into the kitchen. 
 
"Oh, good morning Sasami. I didn't see you there. "He  
replied (STILL thinking about he dream and how hard it made  
him now.) 

>Vivi: "He had time to take care of that in the shower."
>All but Vivi: "Ewww"
 
  Sasami hopped off her little stool and approached Tenchi  
as he went to the table. She had her hands behind her back.  
Her face was bright and tender, and she had wonderful little  
smile across it. Tenchi sat down on the pillow and crossed  
his legs. 
 
"Hmm i can't wait to see what you made Little Sasami!" 

>Aries: "Silently, Big Sasami tapped her foot and scowled at Tenchi" 

Tenchi laughed as he saw her coming toward him. 

"Here u go Tenchi!" She said softly as she revealed the  
plate behind her back. 
 
"Wow Sasami! It looks wonderful, Pancakes, muffins, and  
chopped fruit!" He exclaimed. 
 
  She gently put the plate down in front of him and he dug  
in. 

>Rydia: "Using his roots to siphon all the nutrients out of the food"

She sat down next to him and placed a plate before  
herself. She grabbed some chopsticks and began to eat-up the  
wonderful meal. About this time, it finally accrued to  
Tenchi, Where is everyone else! 
 
>Vivi: "Now I'm certain."
>Rydia: "About what?"
>Vivi: "Even I can write better than this guy."
 
"Hey Sasami, where is everybody?" He asked her as she just  
stuffed a large amount of food in her mouth. She struggled  
to swallow quickly so she could answer.

>Aries: "I have a feeling that the same sentence will be used later on."
>Vivi: "What?"
>Relm: "Don't worry, you'll understand later"
>Vivi: "Okay" 
 
"Oh yeah! Let me see now." She said gently, "Ryoko and Ryo- 
ohki went with Mihoshi---" 
 
"Why?" Tenchi asked suddenly, accidentally cutting her off. 
 
"They went to go help Minagi and Washu fix Minagi's  
Spaceship, and Ayeka, Father, and GrandFather went into to  
town to buy some things. 

>Aries: "The town of to.  Sounds like a dangerous place."
>Rydia: "Sounds like a typo"
>Vivi: "Seems to be a lot of those in this fic"

They should all be back later this  
evening." She said. 
 
"So we're here, just you and me?" he asked uncalmly.

>Vivi: "We need to get this guy a thesaurus"
 
*I would think Ayeka or Grandfather would have woken me up!*  
He Thought. 
 
"YUP, just you and me Tenchi!" She shouted with delight. 
 
  They finished their meals and looked at each other.

>Relm(Sasami): "Uh, Tenchi.  What's that hideous thing on your chin?!?" 
 
"Wow, great meal Sasami!" Tenchi smiled. 
 
"You really mean it!?" She shouted. 
 
"Best you've ever made. You're a great cook but this was ju- 
---" He was cut short when Sasami lunged upon him, attaching  
herself to his torso with a huge hug! 

>Aries: "'When overworked blue-haired little girls attack,' tonight on 
Fox"
 
"Thank you Tenchi! I---" Sasami stopped. 
 
  She was on his lap, with her arms still around him as she  
felt something hard within Tenchi's pants. 

>Rydia: "His loaded .45" 
 
"UUmmm Sasami, Maybe you shou----"He failed to finish his  
sentence. When his nose began to bleed! 
 
"Tenchi are you OK?" She sounded worried; "Your nose is  
bleeding!" 
 
"Umm Sasami! I...I.."He stuttered. 
 
"YOU'RE A NAUGHTY BOY TENCHI!!!!" She shouted and quickly  
stood up. Her face was red with anger.  She turned and  
started to walk away.

>Vivi: "I don't get it. Why was his nose bleeding?"
>Relm: "It's one of those anim‚ clich‚s"
>Vivi: "Oh, like the face plant?"
>Relm: "Exactly."  
 
"SASAMI wait!" Tenchi pleaded! He stood up and advanced her, 

>Aries: "Now she was director of kitchen affairs.  Well on he way to 
becoming part of the paid help."
 
putting his hand on her shoulder. She looked at him. 
 
"You're thinking naughty thoughts Tenchi!" She continued. "I  
don't like those things!" Her voice began to rise. "I'm  
goin------" She was interrupted by Tenchi's mouth covering  
her own. 
 
*Damn, I shouldn't have done that! It was the only way i  
could get her to be stop yelling though* He thought. 
 
  Their mouths were still locked as Sasami's yelling turned  
into whimpers. 

>Rydia(Sasami): "Air... need... some air"
 
* I have never.....never...been kissed before.* She thought  
to herself. * I should Struggle, but...but. 

>Aries(Sasami): "Then it wouldn't be a lemon"

I dont want to.  
Tenchi is.....he.....I.  I've always wanted him to kiss....* 
 
  He quickly noticed she wasnt struggling. He put his hands  
on her shoulders so he could stay balanced while he was nelt  
down.

>Vivi: "Uh. How do you 'nelt down?'"
>Rydia: "I have no idea. Just try not to think about it"

 Then the image of the dream came to mind once more.  
The vision of sex. The pleasure has never felt.

>Aries(pleasure): "I just want to feel,  just want to be loved."

 With this  
image he continued to kiss Sasami, but he began to move his  
tounge into her mouth. Sasami was surprised, but she didnt  
resist. 

>Rydia: "By this time she was wavering in and out of consciousness due 
to the lack of oxygen."
 
*This may be my only chance to feel what i felt last night,  
We're alone...but..but with SASAMI!?* His mind raced! 

>Vivi: "Along the back stretch it's 'Ow my foot' in the lead followed 
closely by 'Chocobo Joe'.  But wait... coming through the pack is 
Tenchi's mind!!!"
>Aries: "Wow, Vivi, I didn't know you had it in you."
>Vivi: "Thanks.. I guess."
 
  As she began to move her tounge into his mouth, he broke  
the kiss. He opened his eyes and looked at Sasami is  
question. She was very surprised, and she was blushing. 

>Rydia: "Did anyone get that one?"
>Aries: "Nope."
>Relm: "Not me."
>Vivi: "I haven't gotten half of it, and I believe I'm better off for 
it."
 
"Tenchi....I" She tried to speak. 
 
"Sasami i'm sorry I did that to you., but it was my onl---"  
He was cut off. 
 
"Dont be sorry, I enjoyed it." She said gently. 
 
   With those words Tenchi's eyes opened wide with surprise! 

>Aries: "Allowing the wicked Sun to gain the upper hand and blind him"
>Relm(Sun): "Muahaha.. I have you now.. Hey wait.. get out of here you 
stupid cloud... Bah, foiled again.
 
He didn't expect Sasami to say that. He also didnt expect to  
she was she did next. She advances rapidly and kissed him  
again, hugging him tightly.

>Vivi: "My head hurts"
>Rydia(Ultimicia): "The past, present, and future together in this 
sentence as one.   Time shall compress!" 
 
*Wha?!*He thought

>Aries: "Funny. That's what I've been thinking just about every 
paragraph so far." 
 
   She began to force her tounge into his mouth. He didnt  
resist and he began to work with her. She pressed all of her  
weight onto him. He couldn't catch his balance, so he fell  
back onto the floor, Sasami still hugging him, their lips  
still locked in the passionate kiss. She laid on top of him,  
moving her body with the motion of their mouths. Her legs  
were rubbing up against Tenchi's hard-on. This gave Tenchi  
pleasure. Pleasure he wanted to feel so much. As she  
unlocked her arms from around him and braced herself above  
him. He put his hands on her little waste.

>Relm: "Wow, I could almost understand what the author was saying!"
>Vivi: "Don't even joke like that.  It's not funny."
 
  Time seemed to stop as their kiss went on. It grew more  
and more passionate with every thrust of tounge. Tenchi  
couldn't help himself! He wanted to feel more pleasure, much  
like his dream. So he slowly moved his hands under her  
shirt. He could feel Sasami's soft, young skin. His heart  
was pounded as his hand advancer up her stomach toward her  
chest. 

>Aries(Sasami): "Damn. the meet tenderizer isn't working. maybe I'll use 
the mallet"

As his fingers touched the very edge of her bra, she  
grabbed his hands, and broke their kiss. 
  She sat down on his stomach and rose her torso up. She  
forced his hands out from up under her shirt. Her face was  
flushed. 

>Vivi: "Was this fic dubbed by Pioneer or something?"
>Relm: "Maybe English isn't the author's native language."
>Rydia: "Or he doesn't know about grammar check."
>Aries: "I'll take the first one."
 
"No Tenchi, dont do that...I...." She tried to finish then  
sentence.

>Relm(Sasami): ...Stuff.  I'm sorry, but I'm just not as big as Ayeka. " 
 
"Sasami, dont worry. I.... I've always wanted to do  
this..But" He couldn't quite bring himself to do it. 
 
"Tenchi, I always wanted this too but I...oh .no!"

>Aries(Sasami): "It's the paparazzi!"

She exclaimed and gasped quickly. She was surprised, she was  
didnt mean to say those things. Tears formed in her eyes,  
and she covered her face. 
 
"Sasami..." He said softly.  
 
  Putting his arms on her shoulders. He brought her down  
close to his face. He gently uncovered Sasami's tear swept  
face. Brushing away her tears with his finger. 

>Vivi: "A complex sentence.  That's all I ask for"
>Relm: "Or a complete one for that matter."
 
"I love you." He said to her gently. 
 
  She smiled and closed her eyes. Tenchi lowered her head  
and met her lips to his. They began to kiss once more. He  
put his hands on her waste and slipped them under her shirt.  
She didnt resist. His hands moved up toward her chest and he  
cupped her cotton bra. He coresed her little breasts. Once  
more she grabbed his hands and she forced them out. Raising  
her self-up. Breaking their kiss. Tenchi began to speak in  
protest, but Sasami covered his mouth with her index finger.

>Aries: "Hey, you don't know where that finger's been!"
>Relm: "I can imagine"
>Rydia: "Yea, like in 'Sasami's Quest'..."
>All but Rydia: "What!?!"
>Rydia: "Well, um, never mind."
 
  As she sat down upon his stomach, she grabbed the ends of  
her shirt, crossing her arms at the same time. She slowly  
lifted the little white shirt over her head. Revealing her  
small breasts covered by a thin cotton bra. 

>Aries: "Not for long"
>Relm: "Don't encourage the author."

She threw the shirt aside and put her arms behind her back. Undoing the  
bra. 
 
*Why am I doing this? I can't control myself*She thought. 
 
The slid the straps off her shoulders and let the bra fall  
onto Tenchi. 

>Aries(The): "Ha ha ha, The strikes again.  Oh how I love to unclothe 
young girls."

Tenchi's eyes opened wide with surprise. He had  
never seen Sasami's breasts. They were small and  
undeveloped, but her nipples where large and brownish. He  
diverted his eyes to her face. She was blushing.  
 
"They're very beautiful Sasami, Thank you." He said softly 
 
  She smiled and grabbed his hands. She brought them up to  
cup her small breasts. She gasped as his fingers touched her  
skin. He rubbed them for a little while, then he gripped her  
sides and lowered her toward him. He places her right nipple  
onto his mouth. He began to suck it and lick all around it.  
She gasped with pleasure. Tenchi played with her left breast  
with his right hand.

>Rydia(Ultimicia): "Time shall compress..."
 
  Sasami gasped and moaned with pleasure. He began to bite  
on her nipple lightly. Then he quickly circled her nipple  
with the tip of his tounge, and he began suck open it. 

>[All but Vivi grab their chest in pain]
>All but Vivi: "Ow!"

He placed his right hand on her waste

>Relm: "That's just sick!"

, and he began to move her  
over his hard-on within his pants. They both moaned with  
excitement. They seemed to continue for hours until Tenchi  
finally released her hard nipple. He placed both hands on  
her waste

>Relm: "Is Tenchi a fecalfealiac or something?"

 and looked into her sweet face. She smiled at him.  
He lifted her off of him and he stood up. He brought her up  
with him. Sasami seemed Alltel confused at this point.

>Vivi: "My head is hurting again"
>Aries: "It'll be okay.  Just breathe."
 
  He took her hand a walked toward the low table on the  
floor. 

>Rydia: "Walking past the amazing table on the wall which he dismissed 
as silly."

He picked her up and sat her down gently on the  
table. Tenchi then took of his shirt. 
 
"Sasami, did you like that?" he asked. 

>Aries(Sasami): "Yes, I loved seeing your chest for the last half a 
second."
 
"Y...Yes Tenchi. I loved it. Can we do more?" She asked  
eagerly. 
 
  Tenchi's cock was longing to be freed from it clothed  
prison. It boiled upon his skin and swelled within his  
pants. Tenchi moved around unconftorably.

>Vivi: "I'm uncomfortable at the mere thought of it boiling" 
 
*I Shouldn't...but...but i can't help my self!* He screamed  
within his mind. 
 
  At that point Tenchi reached down and unbuttoned his  
pants. Then unzipping them. Sasami was shocking and  
surprised. 

>Aries: "She then took her keys out of the light socket, blushed, and 
continued to watch Tenchi."

She didnt know what to do, but she couldn't look  
away either! With a sudden moan from Tenchi he lowered his  
pants and underguards 

>Rydia(Hazaka): "What are you doing with Sasami lord Tenchi?"
>Relm(Kamadakay): "Princess Ayeka will be most displeased."

to reveal his long silky cock. Sasami's eyes were wide with shock. 

>Aries: "She then decided to move away from the light socket."

She was speechless. Her mind raced. 

>Vivi: "Oh wait.  Now Sasami's mind has taken the lead"

She looked upon his cock, and the more she  
looked upon it. The more she couldn't resist it. Tenchi was  
embarrassed and he struggled to do something. 

>Aries(Tenchi): "Okay, here it goes."
>Relm(Sasami): "Hey, that's my eye!"
>Aries(Tenchi): "Oh, sorry."

He looked at  
Sasami's face and he went into shock.

>Aries: "They should really take that metal wire out of the outlet."

, and closed his eyes. 
  Then he felt Sasami's hands grab his waste. 

>All: "Ewww"
>Rydia: "Have these people ever heard of a toilet?"

He opened his eyes at looked upon her. 

>Vivi: "I'm getting dizzy from all this 'looking upon', why not simply 
look at things?"
>Relm: "That would be too easy."

She was knelt down in front of him,  
and her eyes were locked onto his cock. Her mouth approached  
his cock, but then she stopped. Tenchi then put his hands on  
her head. He brushed her hair and looked down upon her. He  
nodded his head and she nodded back. He gently moved her  
head toward his cock and she opened her mouth wide. 
  The hot member entered her wet mouth. Tenchi was frozen  
with pleasure as she took in his cock. Her tounge rubbed  
against it as it continued to proceed further into her. 

>Rydia: "She then choked on it and died.  The end"
>Aries: "You really want this to end, don't you"
>Rydia: "More than you can imagine."
 
*It's so hot! I never felt anything like this before!* Her  
mind raced with pleasure and embarrassment. 
 
  Then she began to move his cock in and out her mouth. She  
closed her eyes and she slowly continued. Tenchi was moaning  
and twitching his waste. Moving it in a rotating motion,  
aiding Sasami as she sucked it. She began to pick up her  
pace; she would move it more quickly. She would almost fully  
take it out of her mouth, but she would keep the head within  
her. She circled it with her tounge and she began to suck  
more.

>Vivi: "So, pioneer dubbed the fic's dialogue, but left the gratuitous 
sex scenes in.  Ah, the wonder of free enterprise"
 
Tenchi was in bliss. He was finally feeling this pleasure he  
wanted so badly.

>Aries(Pleasure): "I like it to."
 
  Sasami realized she couldn't fit all of into her mouth

>Vivi: "Direct objects are so overrated."

, so she grasped the rest of the cock with her right hand, She  
began to quickly jack it off while she sucked faster,  
faster. Tenchi grasped her head and moaned loudly. It was a  
wonderful feeling. He couldn't stop himself. It felt so  
good. He didnt want it to ever end. She continued for  
sometime, and was enjoying herself. She could feel Tenchi's  
cock twitching and convulsing. 

>Relm: "It was watching the forbidden Pok‚mon episode."

It grew hotter and hotter as she quickened. Saliva was dripping from her 
mouth and  
Tenchi's cock. Then Tenchi felt something. 

>Aries: "An electrical shock?"

Something he never felt before. 

>Aries: "Never mind"

It was his cock. 

>Vivi: "But he.. Took it out... AGH, my head!!!
>Rydia: "Your such a trooper Vivi.  Don't worry it'll be over soon"

It felt as if it were about to burst. He panicked and quickly stopped 

>Relm: "And pulled the fuse from the mortar"
>Rydia: "But the back up fuse lit and he was blown into a thousand tiny 
pieces"
>Aries: "Not yet"
>Vivi: "Head... hurts..."

Sasami from sucking. Her eyes opened wide with surprise. She slowly  
removed Tenchi's cock from her mouth and she looked up at  
Tenchi, with a worried look. Tenchi appeared to be in pain. 

>Aries: "The fact that his hand was on the hot iron conformed her 
suspicion."
 
His face was red and covered with sweat. She released his member and she 
stood up.

>Rydia(Member): "I'm free. I'm free at last. 
 
"Tenchi?" She asked, trying to comfort him. 
 
"I'm fine Sasami, I just felt something odd about to happen.  
I'm fine now." He reassured her. 
 
"Ten..chi.." She said gently while looking into his eyes. 
 
"Sasami...you were great. I never felt anything like it." He  
said 
 
"You liked it!" She shouted with glee. 
 
"I loved it." He comforted her. 
 
  She smiled and hugged him. Tenchi returned the hug. Then  
he put his arms on her shoulders and he lowered her onto the  
table once more. He sat her down. He reached down to her  
waste and he began to undo her skirt. She didnt resist and  
she allowed him to do as he wanted. He pulled the little  
skirt and her panties off slowly. She leaned back and  
allowed him to get them down her legs. He removed them and  
threw them aside. Sasami now laid upon the table naked.  
Tenchi then put his hands onto her legs. He slowly opened  
them. He spread her legs wide and he looked down upon her  
virgin clint. 

>Aries(Clint): "Are you looking at me?"
 
*I've never seen a girl's before!* 

>Vivi: "It's starting again... THE PAIN!!!"

He quickly thought to himself. 
 
  He got closer to her and he looked down upon Sasami's  
face. She quickly looked away and gasped. He knelt down over  
her and he gently touches her face. He turned it to face his  
own. 

>Rydia(Ultimecia): "You must face the music.  Time shall compress"
 
"What's wrong?" He asked quietly.

>Aries: "Oh, this fic for starters" 
 
"I'm.... I'm embarrassed...please dont look at.... n...me"  
She silently replied. 
 
"How could I stop looking at you. You so beautiful Sasami. I  
love you." He gently explained as he drew closer to her. 
 
"I...I lover you to Tenchi" She said and smiled softly. 

>Vivi: "The.. pain..."
>Rydia: "you know what's fun?"
>Relm: "Proofreading?"
>Rydia: "Exactly."
 
"Are you ready?" Tenchi asked. 
 
"Please Tenchi.... Please be gentle." She muttered, almost  
seeming to talk to herself. 
 
"I wouldn't do it any other way my love." He said in a  
comforting voice. 
 
  She smiled and nodded. He looked down and he placed  
himself before her little virgin clint. 

>Aries: "I hope Eastwood's getting royalties from this fic"
>Relm: "You think anyone would pay to read it?"
>Vivi: "I'd sure as hell pay not to!"

He then placed his cock at the opening. He gently rubbed her sensitive 
skin  
with his hard cock. She moaned. He then began to slowly  
force his member into her. She gasped as it entered her.  
Tenchi braised himself and he continued to enter her.  
 
*Its so tight, I dont think i can get it into her.* He  
thought.

>Rydia: "The 250lb bouncer sorta took care of that." 
 
 He then felt her barrier, panicking he forced his cock in  
swiftly. Tearing into her. She screamed with pain. 

>Vivi: "Me too."

Tenchi panicked and looked upon Sasami.  
 
"Ouch!" Sasami squealed, "It hurts." 

>Aries(Sasami): "Stop Looking upon me.  Your heavy Tenchi"
 
"I'm sorry did ---" He tried to speak, but she cut him off. 
 
"Its alright Tenchi. Please continue. Even though it hurts. -gasp- I 
like it." She said softly. 
 
  So Tenchi filled her with his member. He then moved her  
legs around him. She locked her legs across his back. Then  
Tenchi began to drive into her. 

>Relm: "Now entering the Sasami tunnel, Please pay the toll and have a 
nice day"

She would moan and gasp with  
pleasure with every thrust. Her eyes we closed and her mouth  
was open wide. She grasped Tenchi and held him tight while  
he drove in and out of her slowly.

>Rydia: "The author must have whipped this thing out in a few minutes"
>Aries: "Watch your wording their Rydia."
 
He then began to speed up and move faster. Her clint was  
squeezing his cock and forcing it into her. He moaned with her. 
  They continued to fuck on the table for a long time in  
that position. Tenchi's skin was slapping against hers with  
every thrust. Her moaning and breathing grew louder and they  
fucked. Sasami released Tenchi from her grasp and he stood  
over her, still driving into her faster and faster. He then  
grabbed her wastes and he forced himself into her harder. 

>Vivi: "Now that wouldn't even make sense if it was spelled correctly"
 
"Oh god! -gasp-  oh -gasp- dont stop! -gasp- Harder Tenchi!  
-gasp- Deeper!" She shouted!
 
  He did as she asked. He pounded into her with increasing  
force. She laid on the table, he breasts swaying back and  
forth with every thrust. Finally Tenchi was feeling the  
pleasure he was searching for.

>Aries: "While sadly, Tenchi Musaki was still searching"

 He couldn't stop now. He had finally lost his Virginity, as his dream 
seemed to foretell.  
Tenchi then slowed. He unlocked Sasami's legs. He then  
released his cock from her. She laid on the table, her eyes  
closed, gasping for air. He then laid down beside her. With  
his left arm he lifted her left leg and forced his cock into  
her. He began to thrust faster than before. She braised  
herself up with her right arm and she put her left hand onto  
his head. 

>Vivi: "I probably shouldn't bother asking, but, How do you braise 
yourself?"
>Aries: "I don't know... I just don't know."

Her heart was racing, she never fully realized  
what she was doing, but she enjoyed ever second of it. 
Their bodies worked together as they continued to fuck on  
the table. Tenchi still driving his member into her faster.  
Her breasts were bouncing up and down. They were moaning  
aloud together. Blood was flowing from Sasami's pussy along  
with a river of love juice. 

>Rydia: "What a happy sight."
>Relm: "A horny Teenager having sex with his great aunt who is only 
about 12."
>Aries: "Truly a Kodak moment."

They couldn't stop themselves at  
all. Their bodies were in a mechanical motion that was  
unstoppable. Tenchi could feel Sasami's warm, soft love  
tunnel around his stiff member.  

>Vivi: "Will this ever end."

He lost track of all time, this truly the best thing he has ever felt. 
Sasami's moans  
grew louder and louder. Tenchi realized she was nearly  
screaming. 

>Aries: "The neighbors, however, realized it several minutes ago and 
were on their way to investigate"
>Rydia(neighbor): "Humph, so that kid finally got some"

So he kissed her. Sasami opened her mouth wide,  
ready to accept Tenchi's tounge. With every thrust into her  
young body virgin body, he would slip his tounge into her  
mouth. She would quickly do the same. Sasami tightened her  
grip on Tenchi's hair as they continued to fuck on the low  
table. 

>Relm: "And, I'm spent"
>Rydia: "Again with the word choice."

  Tenchi then slowed again. He broke their passionate kiss  
and he releases his member from her tight cunt. He stood up,  
and he grabbed her waste

>Aries: "This is seriously getting sick"
>Relm: "Getting?"

 and aided her in getting into a new  
position. She was now on her hands and knees. Tenchi then  
tightly grabbed her waste and he thrust himself into her  
once more. Sasami gasped as he drove into her farther than  
before. He began to fuck the little girl from behind. Tenchi  
gave her no time to prepare for his thrusts. He went in and  
out of her with surprising speed. 

>Rydia: "The friction soon caused Sasami to burst into flames."
>Vivi: "How I wish"
 
"Tenchi! Yes! ahhhh! -gasp- ummmm!" She yelled out with  
passion. 
 
  Their skin slapped together loudly with Tenchi's every  
drive. 

>Rydia: "Fore!!!"

They were covered with sweet. They were gasping for  
air with every stride. They felt their bodies growing hotter  
and hotter. They fucked on and on, it seemed almost endless.  

>Aries: "Amazingly, just like this fic."

Tenchi and Sasami seemed to lose their minds as they fucked.   
They refused to halt this pleasure they were feeling. Then  
Tenchi felt it again. 

>Aries: "The electricity?"

He felt his cock; 

>Vivi: "Head... Hurting... Again!!!!!"

it felt as if it was about to burst.

>Rydia: "Ow." 

He didnt know what was happening, but both  
Sasami and Tenchi were reaching their climax. Tenchi could  
feel something moving up through his cock. 

>Aries: "Sadly, it was the alien implanted in his stomach"

It then hit him. 

>Vivi(Tenchi): "Ow, that hurt."
>Aries(It): "Sorry."
 
He was about to cum. 
 
"Oh GOD -gasp- TENCHI! I'm gonna.... I'm gonna.... I'm!"  
Sasami screamed suddenly. 
 
  Tenchi look at her, she looking back at him. 

>Vivi: "I don't like the Pioneer people very much.  They make my head 
hurt."

Her young face covered with sweat and tears. 

>Aries: "I just noticed something."
>Rydia: "What's that."
>Aries: "So far this guy has had a sentence where he missed one part of 
speech."

She suddenly closed her  
eyes and began to moan aloud. Tenchi could feel her cunt  
tightening. Drawing him in. 
 
"Oh TENCHI!!!!" She screams. 
 
  Then Tenchi quickly removed his cock from her. He stood  
before her. 

>Relm(Sasami): "Hey, I wanted to stand first."

With his hands he turned her over and looked  
upon her young naked body, covered with sweet. He then  
grasped his cock. He quickly knelt down over her. His cock  
over her mound, Tenchi could feel it coming. He tightened  
his face and continued to jack him self offer her. 

>Rydia: "Offer her what?"
>Aries:  "Think about it."
>Rydia: "Oh..."

Then it happened. He tried to hold it within him, but it was no use.  
Hot white virgin cum sprayed from his cock and all over  
Sasami's young body. It shot out onto her face and her  
breasts. All over her stomach. It was done. 

>Aries(It): "I'm done"

They had finally felt the pleasure they longed for, and it was over. 
  Tenchi looked down upon the young Sasami, and he kissed her. 
 
  Tenchi softly spoke into her ear. "I love you Sasami."  
  
They lay down on the table together. Sasami was worn out.  
She could barely keep her eyes open as she constantly gasped  
for air. 

>Rydia: "The hard banging she received from Tenchi punctured her lung 
and it was slowly deflating."
>Relm: "It's almost over, you don't have to kill them."
>Rydia: "But I want to."

They fell asleep on the table together. Grasping  
each other. 
 
  Tenchi was awoken by the sound of a grandfather clock in  
the den. He opened his eyes to see Sasami sleeping soundly,  
next to him. He listened to the clock's song. It rang twice,  
then three times. Before Tenchi realized it, it ranges six  
times. He then began to close his eyes. Suddenly he heard to  
sound of the front door opening!

  Next time: Part 2! "Innocent No More" The exciting, heart  
pounding, next episode of "No Need For Virgins" 
        Who's Tenchi's next victim of love as his mind  
slowly faids away! Could it be "Ayeka?"


>Vivi: "More!?!? NO!!!"
>Rydia: "You knew that when we started, but it still horrible."
>Aries: "I hope this guy learns how to write by the next fic."
>Relm[Shaking somewhat] : "Ha, that didn't faze me a bit."
>Vivi: "Please... let go of me"

>[All rise and walk towards the door.  The conveyor belt has disappeared 
and is replaced by a transportation devise]

>Aries[muttering to herself]: "Cheep bastard"
>Vivi: "Anybody got an aspirin?"
>Relm: "I have a few questions.  Like what is a 'Tounge', what was up 
with all the 'waste' grabbing, and how did Tenchi manage to get 'upon' 
Sasami while he looked?
>Rydia: "The mysteries of the universe never end."

>[All are transported to the main room of the SoSI.  Kefka is waiting 
impatiently to see the results of his first experiment]

>Kefka: "Well, i see that your all back.  How was the show."
>Aries: "I hate you."
>Rydia: "Well put."
>Kefka: "Muahahaha"
>Relm[Still shaking]: "Well, you didn't get me Kef."
>Vivi: "That was seriously low."

>[Kefka sits for a while staring at the crew of the SoSI, waiting for 
them to crack... Time passes... Everyone simply stares at the screen]

>Kefka: "Well, that was awkward... But I guess your all well on your way 
to becoming my willing servants.  I will leave you now, but I'll be back 
to administer more of this delightful torture upon you."
>Vivi: "U-P-O-N!!!!!!!!!!!!"

>[Vivi lunges at the screen kicking and screaming.  Rydia and Aries pull 
him off and send him to his new room while they attempt to fix the 
screen.  The screen fades to black]

*********************************************************************** 
Well, that was my first MST.  Hope you liked it.  It took me a while to 
do, but i think it was acceptable.

Special thanks goes out to Kristen for giving me the idea to do a MST 
and putting up with me.  Also, I would like to thank Jon for reading the 
Beta version and laughing hysterically to make me feel better.  Uh, I 
also have to mention Lammy in this because he asked me so nicely, so, 
uh, here it goes... 

Lammy = mentioned

Finally, I would like to give my regards to Tommy, who(when he gets 
around to it) loves a good MSTing.
