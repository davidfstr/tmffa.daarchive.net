Well... I know this won't be as extravagant as what some of our fellow RFFC
members have done, but I'd like to dedicate this poem to the cyan-tressed
wonder who brings joy to my sometimes cold existence...

Forever Wonderful

Whenever I lay eyes upon you
See the lovely things you do
Hear your voice move the stars
I know just how sweet you are

The graceful way you move
The air dances to your groove
I long for your sweet touch
Yet I fear I'm asking way too much

Your essence I do adore
Right down to your very core
You'll know my words ring forever true
When I say, "I love you..."

Happy B-day Ryoko...
