AN MST OF "10-CHI CLAN "The Quickies""
BY 
THE PSYCHOMATIC POET

WITH HELP AND JOKES FROM THE HUMAN LAUGH'O'METER: MINAKO

DISCLAIMER: EVERYTHING HERE DOES NOT BELONG TO ME SAVE 
		FOR THE HUMOR, IF ANY.

=================================================================================================

   High above Earth's atmosphere, two Gundams lift 
off from two seperate space colonies and begin their 
descent towards Earth, the mostly green in color and 
fiercesome Gundam Nataku from Space Colony L5 and the 
deep blueish-purple and regal Gundam Sandrock from 
Space Colony L4. 

   As both Gundams readied themselves for atmospheric 
re-entry, Quatre Raberba Winner's voice came onto the 
intercom, the Sandrock Gundam pilot sounding unnecessarily 
apprehensive.

Quatre: So this Psychomatic Poet person tunes into 
	your console late one night and invites you 
	and me to watch a movie?

   Chang Wufei, the Chinese pilot of Gundam Nataku, 
was still holding back several pieces of information 
from his Arabian friend. The truth was that The Psychomatic 
Poet had cordially invited them both, to MST a lemon fanfic 
this evening at The Ichiban Theater. Not wanting to scare 
the pure and demure Quatre away before any MSTing could 
be done, Wufei had unceremoniously decided to keep quiet 
about the lemon details.

Wufei: Uh-huh. 
Quatre: I find this very weird. Are you sure you're 
	telling me everything?
Wufei(panics): Uh...Zhen zhao gao('Oh dear' in Chinese)...
Quatre(narrows his delicate eyebrows): Wufei...
Wufei: Uh...Oh look! There's the theater!

   Sure enough, both Gundams had passed through the 
atmosphere unharmed and were now hovering directly 
above the theater. 

Wufei: Now if I can just find a parking space...
Quatre: Uh...Wufei, what about over there?

(Wufei looks over to where Quatre had pointed to and 
sees several huge colorful neon signs flashing "FREE 
PARKING SPACE FOR GUNDAMS!!! TONITE ONLY!!!")

Wufei: I don't believe this...
Quatre: Looks like your friend has made ample preparations 
	for accommodating us.
Wufei(sweat-drops): Looks like it.

(As both Wufei and Quatre land their Gundams beside 
the theater and alight onto the pavement, a yellow 
cab pulls up from nowhere and screeches to a stop 
in front of the brightly lit theater. The door opens 
and out steps a cute little red-head in a baby-pink 
spaghetti-strap top and a milk-white mini-skirt. 
Wufei and Quatre nose-bleed uncontrollably.)

Asuka(slams the door to the cab and blares): BAKA!!! 
	Don't think I didn't see you leering at my legs, 
	you hentai!!!

(Wufei and Quatre sweat-drop.)

Jamaican cab-driver(scrolls down the front window): 
	Hey mann! You haven't paid me my fare yet!
Asuka: Dream on! You used me for your perverted sexual 
	fantasies and you still want me to pay!!! Tough!!!
Jamaican cab-driver(throws his hands into the air): 
	Arrgh!! Just mah luck meetin' ye! 

(The cab-driver curses loudly in his native tongue 
and drives off in a huff.)

Asuka(stands on tiptoes and shakes her right fist): 
	BAKA-HENTAIIII!!!!!

(A strong gust of wind blows and lifts up Asuka's 
very short skirt which reveals her clean white panties. 
Wufei and Quatre's nose-bleeds worsen.)

Wufei(holds his hand to his nose): Kleenex! I need 
	Kleenex!!!
Quatre(whips out a box of Kleenex from behind him): 
	Here!!!

(Asuka turns around and spies the Gundam pilots stuffing 
several pieces of tissue up their nostrils.)

Asuka: And who are you two jokers supposed to be?
Wufei(with Kleenex up his nose): What do you mean 
	jokers!!!? I'll tell you who I am! I am justice! 
	I am...huh?

(Just then, a crackling portal opens up in the middle of 
the group and out steps THE PSYCHOMATIC POET!! [Dracula 
pipe organ music, please.])

P.Poet(as The Red Guy from 'Cow And Chicken'): Hellooooo! 
	I'm so pleased to see that our little MST group is 
	INTERACTING...so well!

(The Poet observes Asuka's less-than-modest dressing and 
the Kleenex in Wufei and Quatre's nostrils.)

P.Poet(sweat-drops): Very, very well...

(Wufei catches The Poet's drift and begins to deny most 
vehemently...)

Wufei(quickly removes the Kleenex from his nostrils): 
	Oh no ho ho!! I...It's not what you think!! Errr...
	Quatre and I started fighting and we just punched 
	each other on the nose at the same time!!! Yeah, 
	that's it!! We punched each other on the nose! 
	Honest!! Right, Quatre?(Elbows Quatre in the ribs.)
Quatre: Ouch! Wufei, why did you elbow me in the...
Wufei(glares at innocent little Quatre and hisses): Just 
	nod and agree with me!!
Quatre(nods like there was no tommorrow): Uh-huh, uh-huh, 
	uh-huh!!!
P.Poet(more sweat-drops): Yeah, right Wufei. And I'm 
	the Queen Mother of England...
Wufei: Freak accident!! I'm claiming freak accident!!!!
	(Calms down all of a sudden)And anyway, who are 
	you supposed to be?
P.Poet(produces a dashing smile): I am...THE PSYCHOMATIC 
	POET!!! DEMON GOD OF DARKNESS(Everything goes dark)...
Wufei, Quatre and Asuka: Hey! What gives!!
P.Poet: AND ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH HUMANITY!!!!(The 
	light comes back on to reveal a bunch of mis-shapen 
	hunchbacks crowding around everyone and going "Duh 
	duh duh!!!")
Wufei, Quatre and Asuka: EEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!
P.Poet: And yes, I'm the one who has invited all of you 
	here. Thank you for coming!
Asuka(noticing the hunchbacks getting a tad too interested 
in her): Would you MIND calling off your freaks-of-nature 
	first?!
P.Poet: Certainly, certainly!! How forgetful of me! Ha ha!

(As the Poet snaps his fingers, the hunchbacks disappear 
and the fluctuating portal closes as well.)

Wufei: So you're The Psychomatic Poet, huh?
P.Poet: Indeedy do.
Asuka: I had expected someone freakier, but I guess you 
	qualify for that category.
P.Poet: Hey!! I detest that!! I AM a very freaky person.

(Silence consumes the scene as everyone doesn't know 
what to say. The wind blows and a tumble-weed tumbles 
by. Long vertical lines descend on the group and everyone 
sweat-drops.)

P.Poet: Okayyyy, why don't we start by introducing 
	yourselves to each other and to the readers as 
	well?
Asuka: What readers?
P.Poet(points to you): Those readers.
Asuka: Oh!

(The Poet's suggestion seems to break the ice as Wufei 
steps forward.)

Wufei: I am Chang Wufei of Space Colony L5 and the pilot 
	of Gundam Nataku!!! I AM JUSTICE!!!!!!!!!!(Giant 
	images of Nataku in action looms up behind Wufei 
	as he stands with his fists raised.)
Asuka(whispers): What an ego!
P.Poet(sighs): That's Wufei for you...(stops whispering)
	How's about you being next, Asuka-chan?
Asuka: I will be next and don't call me 'Asuka-chan'! 
	We've only just met!
P.Poet(proceeds to get fresh with Asuka by putting his 
arm around her): All the more reason to cement our 
	new-found friendship by calling you 'Asuka-chan' 
	more often, Asuka-chan!

(Asuka responds by taking off her right shoe and 
countinuously bashing The Poet's head with it.)

P.Poet(trying to parry Asuka's shoe): Ow ow ow ow ow, 
	hey, quit it, ow!! If you, ow, don't, ow, stop, 
	I'm going to have to spank you! Say, that's not 
	a bad idea at all...OW!!!!
Asuka(puts back her shoe): That'll teach you to mess 
	with me!!(Twirls around to face the readers and 
	puts on her sweetest look possible.)Hiii!!! I'm 
	the prettiest, smartest and not to mention, the 
	cutest little red-head you'll ever get to meet 
	in your pathetic, dysfunctional lives!!! The 
	exclusive pilot of Eva-02, I am Asuka Soryu 
	Langley!!!!(Images of Eva-02 in action looms 
	up several times larger than Wufei's.)
Wufei(whispers): What an ego!
P.Poet(sighs): That's Asuka-chan for you...
Asuka(eyes-a-twinkling): I was also invited here by 
	The Psychomatic Poet as the best mecha pilot to 
	ever grace the universe...
P.Poet(with eyes as big as dish-plates): Oh boy...
Wufei: What!!!! I thought you invited me as the best 
	mecha pilot to ever grace the universe?!!!
P.Poet: I can explain...
Asuka: You? The best mecha pilot? Who, are you kidding?
Wufei: Insolence!! You dare speak to the best mecha 
	pilot in this manner, woman!! I am Chang Wufei!! 
	I am JUSTICE!!!!
Asuka(hands on her hips): You're mud, that's what you 
	are! Mud spelt backwards, that is...
Wufei: Ooooo, you wascawy woman!!! You're lucky that 
	I don't fight with girls!!
Asuka: Why? Because you're too scared that we'd kick 
	your egotistical butt back to your little space 
	colony and beyond?
Wufei: By Nataku, woman!!!! I'll show you who's going 
	to kick who's butt...
P.Poet(steps between both parties): Now, now, there's 
	always an amicable way to settle everything, just 
	like Neville Chamberlain and Nazi Germany, Kofi 
	Annan and Iraq and Bill Clinton and Kosovo...
	(shakes his head)what am I saying...
Wufei and Asuka: Huh?!
P.Poet: Never mind that. Okay, okay, I invited 
	Asuka-chan as the best FEMALE mecha pilot to 
	ever grace the universe and Wufei as the best 
	MALE mecha pilot to ever grace the universe...
	is that fine with everyone?
Asuka: Well...
Wufei: I guess...
P.Poet: Good! Now, we can proceed to the theater...

(The Poet gets interrupted by sounds of someone crying. 
Everyone turns to look at the source of all the sobbing...)

Quatre(with tears streaming down his face like Niagra 
Falls): >Sob< If Asuka is the best >sob< female mecha 
	pilot and Wufei is the >sob< best male mecha pilot, 
	then where does >sob< that leave me...>sniffle< 
	>sniffle<...And I didn't even get to introduce 
	myself...

(The vertical lines and sweat-drops make yet another 
appearance...)

Asuka: Oh brother...you can be the most sissified mecha 
	pilot to ever grace the universe then...
Quatre(looks up at the others with big watery eyes): 
	>Sob< >sniffle<...WAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wufei and P.Poet: ASUKA!!!!
Asuka: Geez! Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!!!
P.Poet: I'm sorry too, Quatre. I forgot all about you 
	and your intro.
Wufei: Yeah! If I'm the best male mecha pilot in the 
	universe, than you have to be the most charming 
	one.

(Quatre stops crying and stares at the other three MSTers.)

Quatre: >Sob<...really?
Wufei and P.Poet: Uh-huh, uh-huh!!
Quatre(turns to Asuka): Really?
Asuka: Yes! Yes! Anything to stop you from staring at 
	me with those sick puppy dog eyes of yours!!!!
P.Poet: Now...why don't you intoduce yourself to our 
	readers.
Quatre(cheers up): O-okay...

(Quatre shuffles nervously into the middle of the screen 
and puts his hands behind his back shyly.)

Quatre: H-hello, I'm Qua-Quatre Raberba Winner from 
	Space Colony L4. I-I-I'm also th-the pilot of 
	Gundam Sandrock...(Quatre gushes like a little 
	schoolgirl and runs out of the scene just as 
	images of Sandrock in action appear behind him.) 
Asuka(whispers): What is he! A girl scout?
Wufei and P.Poet(sigh AND shake their heads simultaneously): 
	That's Quatre for you...

(With everything in order[We seriously hope!!!], the 
four MSTers adjourn into the wide and spacious Ichiban 
Theater where they meet up with Washu-chan...)

P.Poet: Everyone, this is(sucks in a big breath)...The 
	Greatest Most Brilliant Scientific Genius in the 
	Universe, Washu-chan!!! >Pant, pant<
Washu-chan: You forgot to say 'cute', Poet.
P.Poet: Uh, sorry 'bout that, Washu-chan! And she's 
	cute too!
Washu-chan(begins to tap her right foot): The whole 
	thing, Poet...
P.Poet: Aw c'mon, the whole thing?
Washu-chan: The whole thing.
P.Poet: Okay, the whole thing it is...(takes in another 
	big breath)...
	EveryonethisisTheGreatestMostBrilliantAndCUTESTScientificGeniusintheUniverseWashu-chan!!! 
	>Pant, wheeze, pant, WHEEZE, koff, koff<
Washu-chan: Thank you, Poet!(Turns to the bewildered 
	MSTers)Hiyeee!!!
Quatre(whispers): What do we do?
Asuka(whispers back): Just do what she does!
Wufei, Asuka and Quatre: Ermmm...Hiyeee!!!
P.Poet(gaining back his breath): Washu-chan will be 
	our projectionist for tonight. She's also here 
	to make sure that none of us runs out of the 
	theater screaming in the middle of the lemon 
	fanfic that we're going to MST.
Asuka: Cool!!
Quatre(tugs at Wufei's sleeve and asks innocently): 
	Wufei, what's a lemon fanfic?
Wufei(everyone stares at him turning red): Uh oh! Erm, 
	uh, well, it's a, a...a thing where people, err, 
	do things...
Asuka(folds her arms): Oh, very enlightening, Wufei...
P.Poet: You mean you didn't tell him?
Wufei: How could I?! I mean, you try telling it to him!!
	(Takes and shoves Quatre's face into The Poet's own.)
P.Poet(staring into a face of pure adolescent innocence): 
	Uhhhhhh.........okay, okay!!! You're right! I can't 
	bring myself to tell him!!!! 
Asuka: Oh, how hard can this be! I'll do it!

(Asuka goes up to Quatre and covers her eyes with both her 
hands.)

Asuka: A lemon is a fanfic that writes about established 
	characters in any anime engaging in all sorts of 
	sexual intercourse, either hentai or yaoi or both!!!
	(Brings down her hands and sees...) 
Wufei and P.Poet(with large waku-waku eyes staring at 
Asuka): No one, and I mean absolutely no one, could've 
	explained that better than you!!!
Quatre(face-faults as the concept sinks into his mind): 
	Eeeeeeewwwwwww!!!!
Washu-chan: If you're all quite finished, I have to get 
	to projection room to prepare the fanfic for MSTing.
P.Poet: Okey-doke. We'll be seeing you, Washu-chan!

(Washu-chan floats up to the projection room in a 
hover-chair and leaves the MSTers to themselves...)

Asuka: Well, let's get to our seats! 
P.Poet: Not just yet.
Asuka: Why's that?
P.Poet: We're waiting for another MSTer...and he should 
	be here right about NOW!!!

(Just as The Poet finishes his sentence, a pale blue 
hand erupts from the ground beneath Asuka and sends her 
jumping into The Poet's arms and Quatre into Wufei's.)

Asuka: AAHHHH!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THAT?!!!!!
P.Poet: That, Asuka-chan, is Lord Raptor!

(The hand gropes around the carpet and a muffled voice 
is heard.)

Lord Raptor: Hmmm...feels like carpet...I hope it isn't 
	another women's changing room...

(The radical zombie from Dark Stalkers slowly emerges 
from the ground. His punk mohawk pops out first, followed 
by his hollow, skeletal face and the rest of his body.)

Lord Raptor(shakes the debris off his body): YEEOOOWWW!!! 
	Subterranean travel rocks, bay-bee!!!(Hits the right 
	side of his skull-head and several pebbles drop out 
	from his left uh, ear. Erm, ear-hole. Errr...ARRGH!! 
	Whatever the heck that was left of his ear!)
P.Poet(in some sort of erotic ecstacy): Don't let this 
	stop don't let this stop don't let this stop puh-
	lease don't let this stop......
Asuka(notices Poet's mumbling and realises that she is 
still glomped onto him): BAKAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
	PUT ME DOWN YOU HENTAIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	(Pounds Poet with her delicate little fists as 
	she screams soprano.)
P.Poet: Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow oooooooo...S&M ow ow ow 
	ow ow ow!!!!!!!!!! 
Asuka(begins to throttle Poet's neck): PUT-ME-DOWN!!!!!!
P.Poet(choking): 'kay!!(Grudgingly puts Asuka down.)
Wufei: Quatre.
Quatre: Yes?
Wufei: Please get down.
Quatre(realisation dawns): Oh, sorry!(Gets down from 
	Wufei.)
Lord Raptor(gives Poet a hi-five): How's it goin, Poet!!! 
	Hur hur hur!!!
P.Poet(receives Raptor's hi-five): Totally rockin', 
	Raptor!!! Hur hur hur!!!
Wufei(whispers to Quatre): They kinda remind me of 
	two really annoying idiots, but I just can't 
	quite figure out who...
P.Poet: Everyone, this is Lord Raptor and as you can see, 
	he is a vicious and bloodthirsty killer zombie.(Wufei, 
	Asuka and Quatre cringes.)And Raptor, they are Chang 
	Wufei, Asuka Soryu Langley and Quatre Raberba Winner.
Lord Raptor(very enthusiastically): Hi guys! Pleased ta 
	meet ya!!!
Wufei and Quatre: Errr...hi Mr Raptor...
Lord Raptor: My friends call me Raptor, my dinner calls me 
	Mr Raptor... 
Wufei and Quatre(look at each other before returning back 
to Lord Raptor): Err...hi-five Raptor-man!!!
Lord Raptor(returns the hi-five): Coolness!!!!
Asuka(still fuming): So why'd you invite HIM as well! He's 
	beginning to make the place smell funny...
Lord Raptor and P.Poet(both of them look at each other, 
bring out two black Stratocasters from behind them and 
begin to engage in some serious head-banging): 'CAUSE WE'RE 
	FELLOW HEAD-BANGERS, MAN!!!! WHITE ZOMBIE!!! METALLICA!!! 
	RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE!!! AC/DC!!! YEAH!!!

(The others look on in disbelief as the head-bangers begin 
to work into a few riffs of 'Enter Sandman'.)

Washu-chan: HEY!! Cut the racket and get to your seats! 
	The show's about to start and I'm arming the security 
	systems!
Lord Raptor and P.Poet(hiding the Stratocasters behind their 
backs): Yes Ma'am!!!
Asuka: I wonder what she meant by arming the security systems...?

(Distracted by the sounds of an argument, Asuka exits from 
her thoughts...)

Quatre: I'm not going in there!! I don't want to watch a 
	watermelon!!!
P.Poet: Quatre, it's called a lemon...
Quatre(starts towards the exit): I don't care!! I'm not 
	watching one!!!

(Not having completed three steps forward, Quatre finds 
himself surrounded by three figures...)

P.Poet(darkened face): Looks like we'll have to...
Lord Raptor(darkened face): ...tie him up...
Wufei(darkened face):...and drag him in there with us... 
P.Poet, Lord Raptor and Wufei(break into malicious laughter): 
	MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
Quatre(shivering like a leaf): I-I'm-m n-not g-g-g-going......
Lord Raptor: Don't say we didn't warn ya...Get'im boys!!!!

(Giant dust-clouds start to form as P.Poet, Lord Raptor and 
Wufei descend on Quatre.)

Asuka(sweat-drops): Boys will always be boys...

(After a short but good tussle, the dust-clouds settle...)

Wufei(dusting off his hands): Now, that wasn't so bad, was 
	it, Quatre?
Lord Raptor(looks down at tied-up and gagged figure): That 
	was easier than duping Sasquatch with a buncha' bananas, 
	heh heh!!
Quatre(standing among them): But I didn't get tied up...

(Lord Raptor and Wufei stare at Quatre momentarily before 
staring at each other.)

Wufei: If he isn't down there on the floor...
Lord Raptor: ...and I'm standing here with you...that 
	means...
P.Poet(somehow manages to un-gag his mouth): PTOOEY!!! 
	YUCKS!! EERGH!! YOU IDIOTS!!!! WHAT IN THE HECK 
	DIDJA TIE ME UP FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!! FREAKIN' HELL!!! 
	JEEEZZZ!!!

(Wufei bends down to The Poet.)

P.Poet: HEY! WHAT IN THE FREAK ARE YA TRYIN' TO DO!!! 
	OH NO YOU DON'T! YOU'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT PUTTIN' 
	THAT CLOTH BACK INTO MY MOUTH!!! HEY! HEY! 

(STUFF!!!^_^;)

P.Poet: HRGHHFFMOFFMMFFT>>FWEEKIN<<HRGHHGRRHORKARHGGGRRFFF
	MOFFGARGHH!!!! HRRRRRR!!!!!
Wufei: I think he sounds better like this...
Lord Raptor: Definately...And boy, can he make those 
	swear-words rhyme or can he make'em rhyme!
Asuka(red-faced): I have had just about enough with this!!!
	(Pinches Quatre by his right ear and yanks hard.) 
Quatre: YEEEOOOWWWWWW!!!!
Asuka: You, are coming in with us either in peace or 
	in pieces, I don't really care which!(Turns back 
	to Wufei and Lord Raptor)And you two! Bring 'Swear-
	words'R'Us' in here on the double, ASAP!
Wufei(snaps to attention): Ten-hut! On the double, Ma'am! 
	ASAP, Ma'am!
Lord Raptor: We're like, totally there, man! I mean, Ma'am!

(As Asuka pulls Quatre to his seat, Wufei and Lord Raptor 
both turn to where The Poet was and sees only a pile of rope 
there.) 

Wufei: Hey, where'd he go?
Lord Raptor: Uh-oh...
P.Poet(from behind them): You didn't think that catching a 
	demon god was that easy, didja?
Wufei and Lord Raptor: Gulp!!

(Asuka and Quatre are curious to hear a unified 
'AAAHHHHHHHHHHH' followed by a maniacal 'MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA' 
and two loud 'WHAPs'.)

Quatre: What was that?
Asuka: I don't know...it sounded like...nien, it can't 
	be...

(In floats The Poet with Wufei and Lord Raptor wobbling 
behind him.)

Quatre: Wufei! How did you get such a big bump on your 
	forehead?!!
Wufei: I don't want to talk about it...
Quatre: Oh, okay.(Pauses for a while.)Lord Raptor! How 
	did you get such a big...
Lord Raptor: I don't wanna talk about it neither...
Quatre: Oh, okay.
P.Poet: Heh heh heh heh!

(Settling into the comfortable leather seats,[from left 
to right: Wufei, Lord Raptor, P.Poet, Asuka and Quatre], 
The Poet snaps his fingers and a fridge pops out from 
nowhere to land beside Lord Raptor.) 

Wufei: What's in the fridge?
P.Poet: Lord Raptor, if you please...
Lord Raptor(knowingly): Lo and behold!!

(As Lord Raptor opens the fridge door, everyone is 
bathed in a sea of golden light. The light fades out 
to reveal the fridge filled to the brim with Yebisu 
six-packs.)

All(except Quatre): Whoa!!
Quatre: Alcohol is very bad for your health.
Lord Raptor: We know. That's why we're drinking it.
Wufei: Hao jiu!(Chinese for 'Good wine!')
Asuka: Ja! This is good stuff!
P.Poet: Of course! If Misato drinks Yebisu, than 
	Yebisu has to be the best!
Washu-chan(calls out from above them): Okay guys!! 
	We're ready to roll!!!
Lord Raptor: Yeah! Bring it on!!
P.Poet: Let's rock'n'roll!!!
Washu-chan: This is the ultimate entertainment experience; 
	3-D TV!!!

(Washu-chan flicks a holo-switch and the reel begins 
to play, leaving the MSTers to watch a big giant purple 
dinosaur hugging a bunch of kids and singing: "I love 
you, you love me..."[And in 3-D too!!^_^;])

All(except Quatre): AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
Quatre: Awww, that's sweet!
All(stare at Quatre): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
Quatre: What'd I do wrong?!
P.Poet: Washu-chan, >gag< wrong reel, wrong reel!!

(The big giant 3-D purple dinosaur begins to giggle 
and prance about before Washu-chan stops the reel and 
the screen returns to normal.)

Washu-chan(sheepish): Heh heh! Sorry about that. 
P.Poet(gasping for air): This had better not be one 
	of your >GASP< infamous pranks.
Washu-chan(innocently): What? L'il ol'me?
P.Poet(viens a-throbbing): Just, just play the right 
	reel this time...
Washu-chan: Roger that!

(Washu-chan replaces the reel quickly and flicks the 
holo-switch on again.)

Lord Raptor(as Samuel L.Jackson in Jurassic Park): 
	Hold on to ya butts!

>Shinji 

All(except): Whew! She got the right one.
Asuka(almost chokes): Hey! When did Shinji-kun ever 
	write a lemon? 
P.Poet: Don't ask me, I'm just as whacked out as you 
	are...

>The 10 o'Clock Assassin, 

Asuka: The 10 o'Clock Assassin, my ass!!
P.Poet: And what a cute ass that is!
Asuka: Danke...hey wait-a-minute!(Realizes that she 
	has just been zinged.)You're asking for a beer 
	can in the mouth, buster.
P.Poet: Uhhh...this is really good beer, huh guys...
Asuka: Don't try to change the subject, you worm!!!
P.Poet: Oh look! Something's coming up on the screen!

>alias Purge Raizah

Asuka: Now I know for sure that this baka is not Shinji...
P.Poet: Whew...

>Terror-Dack-Chill and Mobile Otaku Band.  As well as
>Temple Of Teal-Dressed Goddess, Rolento's Evil Mission,
>Team Yagami, Izumi Maki Fanclub, and
>Society To Prevent Cruelty To Shinji Ikari

Wufei: I wonder what these organisations are?
Lord Raptor: I dunno.

>tyree3@pacbell.net

>This is a rewrite of this fanfic.  Thanks to Shade 
>and Spencer Trace for catching my mistakes.

P.Poet(sips some beer): Must've been lots of them.

>WARNING: This fanfic contains SEX!  

Quatre: Eeewwwwww!

>Viewer's discretion is strongly advised.  

P.Poet: Hah! >Snort!!<

>All the characters portrayed in this fanfic are 18 
>years or older.  

All: So?!!

>ALL OF THEM!!!  

All: SO??!!

>Oh! And the "Lemon Commandment" of Incest has been 
>broken!

P.Poet: Why that dirty lowdown stinkin'...
Lord Raptor: Wufei, ya know those organisations ya 
	asked me about?
Wufei: Yeah?
Lord Raptor: I think they're probably dedicated ta 
	slayin' lousy lemon writers like 'Purge Last 
	Night's Dinner Inta The Toilet' here.
Wufei: Most definately.

>The characters of Tenchi Muyo belong to AIC and 
>Pioneer.

All(except Quatre): Duh!!!

Quatre: Me neither...

Asuka: Shut up, Poet!!

All(except Quatre, sings The Everly Brothers' song): Wake 
	up, little Susie, wake up!

>He opens his eyes and tries to focus them.  

P.Poet: I...can't see!

>Then he rolls over 

Lord Raptor: Good doggie!

>to find that he's not alone; 

Wufei: Dragnet music, please.

>Ryoko's right next to him, waking and totally naked.

Quatre(closes his eyes and covers them with his hands): 
	Aaahhhhhhh!! She's naked!!
Asuka: Get a grip, Quatre! She's just naked; they didn't 
	even get started on anything yet! 

>Ryoko:    Good morning, Tenchi.

P.Poet: Saying 'ohayo' would be sexier...

(Asuka punches him in the stomach.)

P.Poet(gags): Pain!
Asuka: Huh! Hentai!

>     [SHWING!!]

Wufei: Whoa!
Asuka: Ack!
P.Poet(as Robin): Holy speedy erection, Batman! What 
	should we do?
Lord Raptor(as Batman): Tricky situation, Boy-Wonder! 
	I think we should slice it off with the Bat-a-rang!
Quatre: He's got a monster in his pants!!!!

(All the other MSTers face-fault.)

Asuka(to Wufei): Is he for real?
Wufei: Oh he's real, alright...REAL innocent, that is...

>Tenchi:   Oh no, Ryoko!  Not in the middle of the 
>morning!

P.Poet: I've heard about 'the middle of the night', 
	but this 'middle of the morning' thing is something 
	new...

>Ryoko:    Yes, Tenchi.  I want it... right... now...

Quatre: Ermm, guys, what is it that she wants?

(Everyone face-faults. Again.)

Quatre: What?!
Asuka: Oh nothing...she just wants to play 'Hide The 
	Salami'...
Quatre: Oh...

(The other MSTers stare at Asuka.)

P.Poet: Hide the salami...?
Asuka: If you can do better, then DO IT!!!
Wufei(screwy face): I'm never touching salami again...
Lord Raptor: Why not 'Hide The Banana' I wonder...
Wufei(very screwy face): I'm never touching bananas 
	again...

>     Tenchi curses himself 

P.Poet(as Tenchi): I'M SUCH A BASTARD!!! ARRRRRRR!!!! 
	DAMN ME!!!!! DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!
Asuka: Stop doing that before you pass out on the floor, 
	you idiot.
P.Poet: Then you can give me mouth-to-mouth, eh?
Asuka: No, Quatre'll do that...
Quatre(smiling): I'm very good at first aid...
P.Poet: AAAHHHHHHHHHH!!! NO YAOI! NO YAOI!!
Asuka: That should shut him up...(looks at her watch)...
	for about five seconds or so...

>as he grabs Ryoko and slams his mighty Johnson into her.  

Quatre: Hrgh!!!
Lord Raptor(as a commentator): Welcome back to Ani 
	Wrestlin', sports fans!!! The top match tonight 
	features 'Mighty Johnson' and 'Ryoko HA-KU-BI'!!!! 
	And as you can see, sports fans, Mighty Johnson has 
	just SLAMMED BAMMED inta Ryoko!!! A below-the-belt 
	thrust!! WHERE'S THE REFEREE?!!!!
P.Poet: I wonder why they call it a Johnson? Couldn't 
	they call it a Tom or a Harry or a Purge Raizah 
	or a...
Wufei: Poet?
P.Poet: Hmm?
Wufei: That's disgusting.
P.Poet: What's so disgusting?
Wufei: Imagine calling yours a Purge Raizah...
P.Poet(shudders): Ergh! Sorry.
Quatre(to Asuka): I thought you said that they were 
	going to play 'Hide The Salami'?!!!!
Asuka: I did.
Quatre: Then why did that person stick his-his-his...
Wufei: You're starting to sound like a snake, Quatre.
Quatre: His pe-pe-pe-pe...
All(except Quatre): HIS PENIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quatre: Yeah! That's right! Why did he stick his thingy 
	into her-her-her...
All(except Quatre): HER PUSSY!!!!!!
Quatre: Whatever!!! That isn't 'Hide The Salami'!!!!!!!
Asuka: It is.
Quatre: Then where's the salami?!
Asuka(pointing to Tenchi's johnson): See that? Does it 
	look like a hairy salami to you?
Quatre: Yeah...no NO!!!
Asuka: Ah-ha!! And isn't he hiding it inside her, hmmmmmm?!!!!
Quatre: Ah, erm, ah...
Wufei(whispers to Lord Raptor): I can't seem to tell 
	who's beginning to get more and more hentai; Asuka 
	or Poet?
Lord Raptor(whispers back): I think they're both as 
	hentai as the other...
Wufei: Ahhh...

>Never mind that, as soon as he's in, she's already lost 
>deep in hyperspace, 

Lord Raptor: Wow! Talk about technological wonders!
Asuka: What?
Lord Raptor: Forget everythin' bout all yer Gundams and 
	Evas and what-the-hells cuz having sex can open up 
	the portal ta hyperspace!
P.Poet(a light-bulb appears above his head): How's about 
	comin' with me to hyperspace, Asu...

(Asuka sprays a fine mist of beer from her mouth and 
onto The Poet's face.)

Asuka(turns back to the screen): No thank you. I'm 
	allergic to space travel.
P.Poet(face dripping with beer): I think I'll just 
	sit here, shut up and think about how dumb I 
	look...
Asuka: Good idea.

>he thought.  He just wants to get her off and be done with 
>it...
>     [SPLURRRT!!]

Quatre: Eeeeewwwww!!!
P.Poet: Holy shit!
Lord Raptor(turns to a shade of pale green): Orrg!
Asuka: Bleah! I'm agreeing with Quatre on this one...
Wufei: Huh! Me and Meiran can last much longer than...
	those...two?

(Wufei finds the others staring at him with really big 
eyes.)

Wufei(turning red): Er...erm...pretend that I didn't 
	say anything...
All(except Wufei, nod): Alrighty then...
Quatre: Trowa, Heero and Duo should be interested in 
	what you just said...
Wufei(in shock): You couldn't!!!

(Quatre breaks into a grin. ^_^)

Wufei: You wouldn't!!!!

(Quatre breaks into an even bigger grin. ^__^)

Asuka, P.Poet and Lord Raptor: He could. He would.
Wufei(heads in his hands): I'm doomed!!!!! 
Quatre: >Snicker!<
 
>     Tenchi grabs some clean clothes and leaves his 
>room.  Ryoko's on the bed feeling as stoned as Mt. Everest 
>without the snow.

P.Poet: That's it?! No story, no plot and OOCs aplenty!!!
Asuka: Will you relax? You're going to burst a vein. 
	And it's just only the beginning.
P.Poet: That's exactly my point!

>-=**=-

>     He goes into the nearest bathroom, but the door's

>It's Aeka, the princess of Jurai, wearing only her

Lord Raptor: Oh boy.
Wufei: We all know what's going to happen next...
P.Poet: Duh!!
Asuka: "Hide The Salami' time.
Quatre: I can't bear to look!!
Asuka: Wimp!

>Aeka:          Oh, my apologies.  The other washroom 
>is still in repairs (from me and Ryoko fighting over 
>you).  Your father said it was okay to...

Lord Raptor: Hoo-ha!!!
P.Poet: Looks like he's been lifting weights with that 
	thing, eh?

>     Too late!  Tenchi pushes her back into the bathroom 
>and flings off her towel.

P.Poet(as David Letterman): WHAT?!!!
Asuka: Talk about rough fore-play...
P.Poet: I'll be gentle with you, Asuka-chan...IF you 
	want me to...

>BONK!!!!!!!!<

Asuka(setting the giant mallet behind her): That rough 
	enough for you?
P.Poet(with a big bump on his forehead): Ooooo...wittle 
	boo birdies...fwyin' round me head...round 'n' round
	'n' round...

>He takes her by the thighs and slurps his tongue at 
>her soft petals.  

Quatre: Those aren't petals!!!!!!
Asuka: Yes they are; only they aren't flower petals.

>This is not exactly what Aeka wanted...  Change that!  
>This is what Aeka wanted all morning! 

P.Poet: WHAT?!!!
Asuka(very unhappy): This Purge guy seems to think that 
	all girls have a very one track mind on sex...

>Tenchi stuck his mighty Johnson 

P.Poet: Here we go again...

>into the princess's most sacred love canal.  Her majesty 
>was already gone.  Her "Queen's English" has been reduced 
>to Latin, 

Wufei: Latin?
Lord Raptor: Too much Ricky Martin these days.
Wufei: Oh.

>to Greek, 

Wufei: And this?
Lord Raptor: I dunno...too much Yanni?
Asuka: What's next, prehistoric grunts?

>and finally to just prehistoric grunts.

P.Poet(as a country bumpkin): Hooooo-weeee!!!! Well, 
	I'll be dang-nabbed!!!
Wufei: How DID you know...
Lord Raptor: Youse watched this before?
Asuka: Nope. Never.
Quatre(innocently): Then that means you must've done 
	it before...

>BONK!!!!!!<

Quatre(dazed): By the sands of Arabia...and the 
	crescent moon......
Asuka(sets the same mallet down again): Any smart 
	remarks from any of you and you get a mallet 
	on the head, got it?
P.Poet, Wufei and Lord Raptor: Got it...

>     [SPLURRRT!!]

Asuka(groans): Not again!
Quatre: I feel faint...
Wufei: Must he do that so loudly?!!!
Lord Raptor(turns to a shade of darker green this time): 
	Gorrg!!

>     Sigh...  Tenchi took his shower.  

Asuka: For he had stupidly 'splurtted' himself in 
	the face.
All the guys(shudder): Eargh!!!

>Then he puts on his day clothes, 

P.Poet: On his johnson.
Asuka: Poet!!!
P.Poet: Sorry. I couldn't help myself...

>being careful not to awaken her royal highness from 
>her royal high, and leaves the bathroom.

>     Tenchi then goes downstairs, and then realizes 
>not to make as much noise.  Just then, a pair of

>and try to 

Lord Raptor: GRAB his JOHNSON!!!!!
Asuka: RAPTOR!!!!
P.Poet and Lord Raptor: Hahahahaha!!!

>capture him.  With squirrel-like speed and agility 
>Tenchi tries his best to defend himself from said 
>attacks.  

Lord Raptor: HEY!!! Anybody got NUTS?!! 
Quatre: What for?
Lord Raptor: Ta feed the human squirrel over there, 
	MAN!!!
P.Poet: After doing it twice in one morning, he still 
	can move with 'squirrel-like speed and agility'? 
	I don't believe this...
Wufei: Purge must've been 'INTERACTING' with squirrels 
	way too long...catch my drift?
Lord Raptor: Youse got that one right, China-man!

(Wufei and Lord Raptor 'clink' beer cans.)

>But they were too powerful for him to handle.  

P.Poet: Kill'em with your johnson, you wimp!!! 
	COME ON!!!!
Lord Raptor: Yeah! Spray'em wit'cha sticky stuff!!! 
	What am I saying...?

>And he then gets dragged into Washuu's lab producing 
>heavy protest.
>     Shackled to a table within a darkened room, 
>Tenchi soon catches a view of his kidnapper: Washuu,

P.Poet: WHAT?!!!
Asuka: Hey, Washu-chan! You're in this lemon!!
Washu-chan(looks up from her 'The Greatest Most 
Brilliant And Cutest Scientific Genius in the 
Universe Weekly' magazine): WHAT?!!!
P.Poet: Wasn't that what I just said?

>Washuu:   I'm here to collect your sperm samples 
>again, Tenchi.
>     [SHWING!!]

Wufei: He doesn't get tired, does he?
P.Poet: Can you make a crow sing an aria?
Wufei: Point taken.

>     Tenchi doesn't have a choice at this matter.  
>Washuu opens her nyloned legs wide to give him a

(Everyone stares up at Washu-chan in horror.)

Washu-chan(indigniant): That's not me!!!!
Asuka: That's what you say...

(The MSTers stare even harder.)

Washu-chan(turns beet-root red): JUST WHAT ARE YOU 
	INSINUIATING!!!!!

>he'll never forget.  

P.Poet: This is one fic I'd like to forget in a 
	hurry...

>Then she frees his mighty Johnson from its cage 

P.Poet(as a tiger): RRRROOAAAAARRRRR!!!!!
Lord Raptor: Whoa! Wild animal! Put it back inta 
	the cage!! Put it back!!
Quatre: If only Trowa was here; he'd whip that wild 
	beast right back into its cage!!!
Wufei: And Heero would self-destruct with it...BOOM!!! 
	Johnson a la shreds...
P.Poet: Hey hey hey!!! I don't want nightmares about 
	exploding johnsons late at night, Wufei!
Wufei: Oops!! Sorry.

>and proceeds to submerse it into her tight pussy.  

Lord Raptor: It's goin' ta strangle Mister Johnson 
	to death...
P.Poet(wide-eyed): I never knew...
Washu-chan: BUT THAT'S NOT ME!!!!!

>STARE!!!!!0_0;<

Washu-chan: WHY WON'T YOU PEOPLE BELIEVE ME?!!!!!

>Tenchi's cock doubles in size, 

Wufei(dully): Yee-ha.
Lord Raptor(dully): Cow-a-bunga.

>and Washuu uses every known trick in the Universal 
>Kama Sutra book to get him off.  

Asuka: Is there such a book?
P.Poet: I think this writer got it mixed up with his 
	dairy...
Asuka: Check that.

>His fuse goes short very quickly, and Washuu feels 
>it as well.

(Everyone looks at Washu-chan.)

Washu-chan(here-a-vein, there-a-vein): NO-I-DON'T-
	FEEL-IT!!!!
 
>She pulls him out, grabs the bucket nearby, and 
>performs fellatio over it.

Washu-chan(horrified): AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

>     [SPLURRRT!!  SPLURRT!!]

Lord Raptor(turns bright green): >SNORK!!<
Quatre: No more! No more!
Asuka: I'm going to get sick...
Wufei: Me too...
P.Poet(waves his hands wildly): What is he trying 
	to do?!! Put out a fire?!!!

>Washuu:   My-my, Tenchi.  That's all you can give?

All(including Washu-chan): WHAT?!!! Like that's not 
	enough?!!!

>Tenchi:   I couldn't help it.  Ryoko and Aeka got 
>to me first.

P.Poet(sarcastic): Oh yeah, like, we need to be, 
	y'know, totally reminded!

>Washuu:   Oh, damn my luck!

Asuka: Better luck next time, eh, Washu-chan? 
	Washu-chan?
Washu-chan(mumbling psychotically): I'm going to 
	kill him! Oh yes, kill him and strangle him 
	and maim him and maul him and dissect him and 
	lobotomize him to find crap in that peanut-sized 
	brain of his and then I'll burn him and throw 
	him to my Cee'non limpets and......mangle......
	slash......HAHA......
P.Poet(very scared): We'd er, better not er, 
	antangonize Washu-chan, huh?
Asuka(also very scared): J-Ja!
Wufei: You've got my vote...
Quatre: G-Good idea!
Lord Raptor: I-I don't think I wanna die a second 
	time...
Washu-chan: BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
All(huddle together): MOMMYYYYYYY!!!!!

>-=**=-

>     Despite his morning troubles 

Asuka: So now he thinks it's troublesome...

>Tenchi manages to have some breakfast 

All(extremely relieved): Whew!! No Sasami lemon 
	scenes!!

>and be on his way to the city.  Along the way he 
>almost passes the Miho-Kiyo residence only to realize 
>that he's suppose to pick up something from them.  

P.Poet(in disgust): How convenient...like the captain 
	of The Titanic realised that he was supposed to 
	sink it...

>He knocks on their door...

Lord Raptor: With his knuckles or his freakin' 
	johnson?
P.Poet: Raptor, that's a mystery that'll remain 
	buried under tons of dust in the drawers 
	of The X-Files...
Wufei: X-Files theme, please!!

>Kiyone:   Who is it?!

All(except Quatre): It's me, Johnson.

>Tenchi:   It's me, Tenchi!

All(except Quatre): Damn!!

>Mihoshi:  Alright!  It's Tenchi!  Come on in!

Asuka(as Mihoshi): Alright! It's Johnson! Wait 
	here while I pour boiling water all over 
	you!
All the guys: Ouch! Hot stuff!!!

>     And he does what he says, only to find out 
>that the Miho-Kiyo duo are currently trying out

>     [SHWING ONCE MORE!!]

Wufei(shrugs): Shwing once, shwing twice; who's 
	counting?
Lord Raptor(twanging his electric guitar): Old 
	McDonald had a farm, ee-ii-ee-ii-oh; And 
	on his farm he had a horny Tenchi, ee-ii-
	ee-ii-oh; With a shwing shwing here, and 
	a shwing shwing there; Here-a-shwing, 
	there-a-shwing, everywhere-a-shwing-shwing...
Asuka: Very cute, Raptor, VERY cute...

>Mihoshi:  Wow!  Whatta big Johnson you got there!
>Kiyone:   I guess we should do something about it.

Asuka: Yeah, like, cut it off and fire it to the 
	moon so that he can't use it anymore!
P.Poet: Nightmare city, here I come...

>     A coin gets tossed.  Mihoshi calls for heads.  
>The coin shows tails and Kiyone ends up giving him 
>head.  Tenchi's trapped within the world of total 
>pleasure 

P.Poet(as Tenchi): AAAAHHHHH! I'M TRAPPED!!!! Lemme 
	out, lemme out!!!

>as she gives his mighty Johnson a tongue massage.

Asuka: Just how do you give someone a tongue massage?
P.Poet: Step one: Get a fiery red-head who's 14 years 
	old, 3/4 German and 1/4 Japanese and preferably 
	an Eva pilot. Step two: Get her naked and on a 
	bed so that you can...

>STOMP!!!<

(Asuka stomps on The Poet's foot hard.)

P.Poet(holding onto one foot and hopping up and down): 
	Ow ow ow why'dja do that for?!!
Asuka: That's for harrasing me!!!
P.Poet(still hopping up and down): But I was just 
	narrowing down the factors!!!
Wufei: C'mon Poet, that woman just stepped on your 
	leg. How painful can that be?

>STOMP!!!<

(Asuka stomps onto Wufei's foot very hard and now we 
have two idiots hopping up and down and saying "Ow ow 
ow ow ow!!!")

>     [SPLURRRT!!]
>     Kiyone's whole face was covered with his sticky, 
>white cum.

Asuka: I'm not going to look at that. Uh-uh.
Quatre: AHHHH!!! HER FACE!!!!
Lord Raptor(turns extremely green): I think I'm about 
	ta lose my lunchuurrrr...
Wufei: Uh guys...I don't think Raptor's feeling too 
	well...he looks kinda green...
Asuka: He's a zombie. He's supposed to look green.
Wufei(pointing to Lord Raptor): Not like that he's 
	not...

(Asuka, Quatre and Poet looks over at a very neon green 
Lord Raptor.)

P.Poet: Hey, Raptor. You feelin' okay?
Lord Raptor: Sure...no prob...don't you worry bout me, 
	cause I'm the Raptor Man...oh man my stomach's 
	churnin'...
P.Poet: If you say so...

>Kiyone:   Mmmm...  Delicious. 

All(except Quatre): NO FREAKIN' WAY!!!!

>^_^ But I don't think we're done with you just yet.

P.Poet(now back in his seat): He's going to die if this 
	goes on any further. His johnson's going to explode.
Quatre(covers his eyes with his hands): Tell me when all 
	of this is over...

>     She then tells him to go over to Mihoshi, who 
>was already getting herself ready for the ultimate 
>in manhood.  In no time he starts thrusting into her 
>like a piston.  

Wufei: It didn't explode, Poet.
P.Poet(disgusted): So I stand corrected...sue me...

>His actions cause the beautiful scatterbrain... to 
>actually start thinking rationally.  

All(except Quatre, pretend to cough): Bullshit, bullshit!! 
Asuka: So now sex can make you smart? Give me a break...
	or better yet, give Purge's bones a break. 

>Kiyone is puzzled by this, but her train of thought is 
>cut short 

Wufei: The Orient Express has just gotten derailed, I 
	see?

>as Tenchi returns the favor and gives her pussy 

Asuka(happily): Okay Quatre! You can watch now!
Quatre(opens his eyes): Thank yo...

>a full tongue massage.  

Quatre: AAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Wufei, P.Poet and Lord Raptor: ASUKA!!! Stop scaring

	gonna BLOW!!!!!
All: AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

All: Whew...

P.Poet: Gush gush gush...

P.Poet, Lord Raptor and Wufei: SLUSH SLUSH SLUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH......

Wufei: Wow! The surround sound system in this theatre 
	is really good! I can hear the 'splurt' as if it 
	was just beside me!
P.Poet, Quatre and Asuka: You did...

(Wufei turns to see what Asuka, Quatre and Poet was 
already looking at. Lord Raptor had just purged all 
of what he was worth onto the seat in front of him.)

Wufei: Eargh!
Lord Raptor: I don't feel so gooooooo......>BARF!!<
P.Poet: Washu-chan!! 
Washu-chan(busy stuffing lobotomy tools into a small 
voodoo doll): Yes?
P.Poet: Stop the reel for a minute...
Lord Raptor: >BARF!!!!<
P.Poet: Oh boy, someone's going to have a hard time 
	cleaning that up...(simply points to the convulsing 
	Lord Raptor.) 
Washu-chan: Ahhh, somebody doesn't have the stomach 
	for very disgusting lemon scenes...(stops the reel)
	Okay!!!
P.Poet: Thanks!

(The MSTers move to the next aisle, bringing along 
the sickly Lord Raptor with them. Sitting back in 
the same sitting arrangement, The Poet gives the 
thumbs-up to Washu-chan.)

P.Poet: Lights!! Camera!!!
Washu-chan: And action!
Wufei: You sure you're still up to it?
Quatre: Yeah...you look kind of pale...even for a 
	decomposed body.
Lord Raptor(Mexican accent): Mucho gracias, Quatre, 
	I feel SO much better now...

All(except Quatre): Damn!!!

P.Poet(very pissed): She just said 'afternoon', fool. 
	She did not hitch her skirt up and asked you to 
	screw her. There is no need for you to 'SHWING'.
Asuka: >Groan!< He'll 'shwing' to just about anything...
Wufei(disgusted): Yeah...we could read out addresses

P.Poet(whacks his forehead): Oh great!! Now, you can

Lord Raptor: I have no idea how this punk coins his

The Rest: We know, we know; he has another typo...
P.Poet(glumly): Thank you very much...

>promising to meet (and screw) again.

All: >GROAN!!!<

>-=**=-

>     Maybe the rest of the day will...  Aw, screw it!  

Wufei: Well, he's been doing just that from the very 
	moment he woke up...

>Tenchi thought as a Ryo-Ohki-style spaceship hovers 
>over his head.  He tries to run, 

Asuka: Run! Run like the wind and never look back!

>but he's immediately captured by the ship's tractor

Wufei: He just had to stop and screw the roses...

>the center of a dark room where infamous bounty hunter 
>Nagi conjures up a way of using him as bait for Ryoko.  
>For some reason she has the heat up too high.  

P.Poet(really sarcastic): Oh yeah......for 'some' 
	reason, she has the freaking heat up too freaking 
	high...

>So she decides to remove her black cloak.  She ends 
>up revealing to poor Tenchi her ravashingly 

P.Poet: I spy with my little eye...
Asuka: Give it a break, Poet...

>slender body wearing a see-through fabric nightgown.

Asuka: Oh for crying out loud!! She's supposed to be 
	an inter-galactic bounty hunter, not an inter-
	galactic hooker!!
The Rest: Hear, hear!!

>     Nagi smirks at the large bulge in his pants,

>upon her prey like an eagle 

Wufei: Yes!! Finally, finally someone had the guts 
	to whack his johnson in!!

>and shoves his painfully mighty Johnson into her.  

Wufei(as David Letterman): WHAT!!!
Asuka: You guessed wrong, Einstein...

>She manages to get it all in despite the immence 

Asuka: Aren't you going to say anything?
P.Poet: Why? Oh! Thanks for reminding me! TYPO!!!!
Asuka: Ack!! I just zinged myself!!!

>pain caused from such manhood as his.  

P.Poet(passes around ear-plugs): Ear-plugs?
The Rest: Check!

>But it looks like it's Tenchi's turn to be lost 
>in hyperspace.

P.Poet: Now!

(Everyone stuffs the ear-plugs into their ears and 
close their eyes.)

>     [SPLURRRT...!!]

(Everyone removes the ear-plugs and re-open their 
eyes simultaneously.)

Lord Raptor: Whew! That, was a close one!
Asuka: You can say that again!
Lord Raptor: Whew! That, was a close one!
Asuka(rolls her eyes upwards): Zombies!

P.Poet: She sounds like a moose in heat...

(The other MSTers all stare at Poet.)

P.Poet: What?!

(The other MSTers continue to stare at Poet.)

P.Poet: DOESN'T IT?!!

>as she drenches his mighty Johnson, mixing her

Wufei(winces): Suddenly, I don't feel like opening 
	my mouth to drink my beer...
P.Poet: Me too...
Lord Raptor: Me three...
Asuka: Me four...

>Mitsuki:  FREEZE!!  You are under arrest!  Come 
>out with your hands out,  NOW!!

P.Poet: I've heard of 'come out with your hands UP', 
	but 'come out with your hands out'...? 
Asuka: It definately sounds stupid.
Lord Raptor: At least it's better than 'come out 
	with your johnson out'...

>     It's Mitsuki in her Galaxy Police ship.  It 
>seems that Nagi has spent too much time in the "No 
>Spaceship Docking Zone."

Lord Raptor: More like the "No Spaceship Fucking 
	Zone".

>Nagi:          Damn...!

>-=**=-

>Mitsuki:  Are you alright?

P.Poet: He's been 'johnsonizing' people for the 
	whole freaking day with his freaking little 
	pal of a johnson; what do you think?!

>Tenchi:   I'm not sure.  I've been having sex with 
>women all day.

All(except Quatre): DUH!!!

>Mitsuki:  Tell ya what: Take a little rest.  Lay

>Tenchi:   Why, thanks Mitsuki.  (She's not really 
>as mean as Kiyone said she is.)

>     While Tenchi slept Mitsuki takes the opportunity 
>to try out those neat street clothing she's got from 
>Mihoshi.  Apparently she's making a bit too much noise. 

Lord Raptor: How much noise can ya make from trying 
	out clothes, huh?
Wufei: Just as long as it doesn't sound like a moose 
	in heat...

>Tenchi wakes up to see what the commotion's all

P.Poet: Jeez! This guy has a more powerful mojo than 
	Austin Powers!!
Lord Raptor(as Austin Powers): Yeah, baby, YEAH!! My 
	mojo!!
Asuka: That's disgusting!
Lord Raptor: Heh heh! Sorry!

>Mitsuki:  Oh no.  Guess I was too much stimulation 
>for you there, huh?
>Tenchi:   Mitsuki...  Help me...
>Mitsuki:  Alright, alright.  Here you go, kid.

Asuka: This is so stupid...

>     Tenchi viciously stabs his might 

P.Poet: Sh! I see something!
Asuka: What?! What?!
P.Poet: A typo!
Asuka: You're hopeless!

>Johnson into the depths of her sex canal. But after 
>a while he notices that the expression on her face 
>didn't change.

P.Poet: Can it be true? Can it be that he's weakening?
Wufei: Don't get your hopes too high up, Poet...

>Tenchi:   Uh...  Mitsuki.  You're... not...
>Mitsuki:  Oh, me?  I do this all the time.  This is 
>how I rise through the police ranks.  And besides, 
>I earn some pocket change that way.  So, screw to 
>your heart's content.

>     "Screw" was the word that immediately set him 
>off.  His manhood continuously plunges into her like 
>a raging demon.  

Lord Raptor: Somehow, this phrase reminds me of someone 
	from 'Devilman Lady'...
The Rest: I don't wanna know...

>Her power universal is so good; it's bringing him to 
>the brink of eruption.  

Quatre: Shouldn't we get ready?
P.Poet: Oh! Thanks for reminding me, Quatre. Okay guys, 
	one for the money...

>Mitsuki, after years of 

Asuka: Two for the show... 

>her pussy being plunged into, 

Lord Raptor: Three to get going...

>finds herself moaning louder...

Wufei: And GO GO GO!!!

(STUFF!!!>_<!!!)

>     [SPLURRRRTT!!!]

(After a while, everyone opens an eye to look around. 
>_0? )

All(un-plugging their ears): It's over...

>Mitsuki:  (How can this be?  I've had dicks as big 
>as these before...  But obviously this guy knows how 
>to fuck a lady.  

Wufei: With all due respect madame; YOU are no lady!

>I should do more Jurai-blooded Earthlings from now 
>on!)

P.Poet: No, you should start earning your pocket 
	money by some other ways before you contract 
	a horrible disease called syphilis.
Lord Raptor: Or gonorrhea.
Wufei: Or AIDS.
Asuka: Will you all stop that!!

>Tenchi:   Mitsuki... I have to go...

P.Poet(as Tenchi): I have to go and 'johnsonize' 
	myself.
The Rest(shudder): Eearghh!!

>Mitsuki:  Go?  And why's that?
>Tenchi:   My friends are worried about me at home.

Lord Raptor: No, they're worried bout yer johnson.

>Mitsuki:  Oh.  I'm sorry...  I just need you to 
>help fill out this Incident Report, please.
>Tenchi:   *_*; It doesn't change, does it?

>Mayuka:   Daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy!!  I'm so glad 
>that daddy's back!!

Lord Raptor: Daddy? Say, do ya remember that 
	Purge-ass said something about the incest 
	commandmant being broken?
P.Poet: Yeah, what about it?
Lord Raptor: Does the phrase 'daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy' 
	mean anythin' to ya people?
P.Poet(in shock): No way!! You mean...!! 
Asuka(points to Mayuka): Not with her!!!
Wufei: Kisama!!
Quatre: Not incest!! No!!! For the love of Venus, 
	noooo!!!

>Tenchi:   Ouch...  Mayuka.  You weigh a ton!

All: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

All: STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!
Lord Raptor: Madness!! This is madness!!!!

Asuka: That, was the single, most disgusting, vile, 
	foul and peverted lemon scene I have ever SEEN!!!!!!!
Wufei: I AM JUSTICE!!!! AND I WILL ANNIHILATE THE 
	LIKES OF THESE HENTAI SCUM WITH MY FURY!!!!
P.Poet(EXTREMELY PISSED-OFF): WHY DON'TCHA GO FRIGGIN' 
	SCREW YER OWN MOTHER, PUNK!!!!
Lord Raptor(shaking his head): I feel sorry for any 
	children that this writer has or is going to 
	have...
Quatre(looks half-demented): >Sob<This is too cruel...
	too cruel...

>Tenchi:   I'm going to hell for this...  I just know 
>I'm going to hell for this...

All: YA DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!

>-=**=-

>     After a good dinner, Tenchi decides to hit the 
>bed early.  

P.Poet: Does he have no conscience?! Did he just 
	forget what he just did!!
Lord Raptor: So what if there ain't any Sasami lemon 
	scenes...what's the difference?
Asuka: It's all just as perverted.

>He knew it's going to be one of those days again 
>tomorrow: The fighting, the explosions, the swift 
>mood changes, the havoc, the drama, and ultimately 

P.Poet: The 'johnsonizing'...aw man, I don't feel 
	funny no more...
Wufei: We know how you feel, Poet, we know...

>the fucking.  This is terrible.  He wished he'd 
>never freed the demon, Ryoko, from her prison.

Asuka: I wonder which idiot freed Purge from HIS 
	prison...

>     Just then, a soft light appears in the middle 
>of the room.  Tenchi gets up to see what it is, 
>thinking it's probably Ryoko or Washuu trying to 
>get another fuck from him.  

All(except Quatre): DREAM THE FREAK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!

>But then, it turns out to be the High Goddess of 
>Jurai Tsunami; 

P.Poet: Hey, what's she doing here?

>wearing the Juraian ceremonial robe, a weak smile 
>on her face, and nothing else.

Wufei: You know her?
P.Poet: I'm The Demon God Of Darkness And All That 
	Is Wrong With Humanity; of course I know The 
	Great Juraian Tree Goddess Tsunami!!!
Asuka: Do you gods and goddesses give yourselves 
	your own titles or did they just fall out 
	from the sky, hmmm?
P.Poet(left eyebrow twitching): Never mind that!

>Tsunami:  Well, Lord Tenchi.  It seems that it was 
>a busy day for you.
>Tenchi:   Well... heh.  The only complaint is that 
>it's taking it's toll on me.  I can't keep doing 
>this forever, you know.

Wufei: You have to be joking...
P.Poet: By the looks of it, your stupid johnson 
	will outlive even the apocalypse...

>Tsunami:  But you have drunk the water from the

Lord Raptor: Him or his freaking johnson?

>There is no need for you to worry about that.
>Tenchi:   You've got to excuse me, Miss Tsunami.  
>All I want right now is sleep, pure unadulterated 
>sleep.
>Tsunami:  Then let me send you to dreamland, Lord 
>Tenchi.

Asuka: Hit him over the head with a mallet! Go on! 
	That'll send him to dreamland in no time at 
	all.
     
>	And with that, the High Goddess of Jurai flings

Lord Raptor: Yikes!!!
P.Poet(clawing his own face): NOOOOO!!!! NOT NOW!!!! 
	NOT HER!!!! NOT HERE!!!!! ARRRGHHHH!!!!
Wufei: Someone give him a sedative before he starts 
	clawing us as well...

>BONK!!!!!!<

Quatre: Poet!!! Are you alright?!!!
P.Poet(looking like one of his deformed hunchbacks): 
	Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh................

>and kisses her in the mouth.  He moves her bikini

>Johnson.  

Quatre: What does 'mighty*2' mean?
P.Poet: Between you and me, Quatre; I don't have the 
	slightest idea what that shit means.
Lord Raptor: What did I tell him bout comin' up wit 
	his own terms!!! I tell him ta stop and what 
	does the idiot do? He goes and comes up with 
	'mighty*2'!!!! JEEEZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!

>It ends up being more than she can handle, but is 
>too lost into the fusion of pain and pleasure to 
>tell him to stop.  

Asuka: If I ever get my hands on him; IT'LL BE ALL 
	PAIN AND NO PLEASURE!!!!!!
P.Poet(murmuring to himself): Under normal 
	circumstances, I'd be saying something about 
	what she just said, but somehow, somehow, I 
	know that I'll get mashed with four mallets 
	if I did...

>Tenchi's animalistic behavior pounds away at

Wufei: Ughh!! Get that away from me!!! Get that 
	away!!!
Quatre: Why are you so scared, Wufei? Isn't that 
	normal for you and Meiran?
Wufei(out pops a vein): THAT'S NOT FUNNY QUATRE!!!
Quatre: Then why are they laughing? (Points to 
	the chuckling MSTers.)
Wufei: AHHHHH!! Wo so bu liao le!!!!(Chinese for 
	"AHHHHH!! I can't stand it anymore!!!!")

Asuka: Yeesh!! Not to mention that he also has 
	a very healthy and active sex life.
P.Poet: Now I feel kinda jealous...I don't even 
	have a life of any kind.

>Tenchi:   Mom.  My life is so messed up now.  
>I'm having sex with all these alien girls.  And 
>I can't seem to stop myself.

Wufei: No...it's your johnson you can't seem to 
	stop.
Quatre: Maybe he should go cold-turkey...
Asuka(as Siegmund Freud): Und zyou are azzicted 
	to sex, zyou say? Very inzerestzing!

>Achika:   And they can't seem to stop you either?
>Tenchi:   They don't wanna stop me!  I mean...

(Everyone turns to stare at Quatre.)

Quatre: Di-Did I do something wrong again?
Asuka: You know what, Quatre?
Quatre: N-no, what?
Asuka: That was the most agreeable thing you've 
	said for the whole of this evening.
Quatre: T-thanks!

Asuka: Bad mommy cat!! Bad!!!

Quatre: EEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
P.Poet(calls out to Asuka): Bonk him before Raptor 
	really gets hungry!!!
Asuka: Here we go!!

>BONK!!!!!!!!<

Quatre(totally dazed and confused and with a big 
bump on his head): ...By the shifting deserts of 
	the night and the sand in my eye...
Wufei: >Huff huff< Let's drag him back to his seat.

>Drag drag drag<

>Plop!<

Asuka: Whoo! Does Quatre get into those moods 
	often?
Wufei: Only when he's very, very, very stressed...
P.Poet: I can understand; this lemon can make 
	anyone stressed.
Lord Raptor: Ick ack org.
P.Poet(sweat-drops): Uh, I think you need this...
	(hands Raptor his lower jaw bone.)
Lord Raptor(fits back his jaw): Thanks; I needed 
	that.

>-=**=-

Quatre(wakes up and feels his head): Ouch...erm 
	guys? Why is there such a big bump on my 
	head? 
The Rest: We'll tell you about it some other 
	time...

>     Tenchi's eyes snap open, bringing him 
>back into the real world.  

P.Poet: Welcome back. Now we can all kill you 
	for fantasizing about johnsonizing your 
	own mother.
All: Yay.

>That was the world wet dream he had since the 
>alien girls bunked here.  But somehow he still 
>feels that great warmth and wetness along his 
>Johnson.  

Asuka: Slugs. Slugs are sliming along his johnson.
All the guys: Eeeeewwwwwww!

>Someone's in bed with him.

Wufei: >Groan!< Tell me something new...

>Tenchi:   (I wonder who it is this time.  If 
>it's Ryo-Ohki, I'm committing suicide.)

P.Poet: What now? After covering mindless sex, 
	orgies, incest and pedophilia, does this 
	writer also want to include bestiality 
	as well?
Lord Raptor: Talk about twisted...

>     He flings off the covers, and a beautiful 
>girl had his mighty cock 

Asuka: Oh now he calls it a cock...
P.Poet: So which one do you prefer to call it; 
	a johnson or a cock?
Asuka: Personally, I prefer to call it a...
All the guys: Yes......?
Asuka: WHY YOU DIRTY LITTLE PERVERTS!!!!!!

>BONK BONK BONK BONK BONK!!!!!!!!!!!<

P.Poet: Ooo my achin' head...!!
Lord Raptor: Asprin! I need asprin!!
Wufei: Hao tong!! (Chinese for "Pain!!")
Quatre: Now I have two bumps...
Asuka: Serves you right! Huh!

>all into her mouth and down her throat.  

Lord Raptor: Whoever she is, the poor girl's 
	gonna choke to death on that thing. 
	Imagine; a dead body gorging on your...
Wufei: Don't say it.
Lord Raptor: Right.

>It can be said that it was the best "deep 
>throat" performed by anyone within this series.  
>Only...  This girl is...

Wufei: Drumroll please!
All: Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt! Ching!

>Miaka:    VANILLA ICE CREAM!!

All: WHO AND WHAT?!!!!!

>Tenchi:   [Grimacing] Dammit, Miaka!  Why 
>the hell do you gotta come all the way from 
>"Mysterious Play" to suck _my_ dick?!!

>Miaka:    [With his dick still in her mouth.]  
>Because it's the biggest.  Bigger than Tamahome, 
>Hotohori, Nuriko, Mitsukake, Tasuki, and Chichiri 
>combined.

P.Poet: What a great skill.
Quatre: Why?
P.Poet: How many people do you know can speak 
	with a cock up the mouth?

>Tenchi:   That's it!  I'm turning gay!  Maybe 
>Nuriko's still available...

All: AHHHHHHHH!!!! NO YAOI!!! NO YAOI!!!!

>                   THE (very disturbing) END

Asuka: No doubt a most disturbing end...
Wufei: Finally...it's really over...
Quatre: Lemon finish! Yay!

>*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *

>                          Next Fanfic?

All: HECK NO!!!

>     Mikado Ichiban VS Asuka 120% & Advanced Variable Geo:
>                 Phrank's Day (Of Getting) Off
>                            someday...

P.Poet: What bullshit is this?
Lord Raptor: Oh, just pure and unadulterated 
	bullshit, I guess.
Asuka: And why is my name up there?
Lord Raptor: You don't suppose he's going to 
	write a lemon about you...?
Asuka: NOOOOOOO!!!!! It can't be!!! I'd rather 
	die than be in a Purge lemon!!!!!!
P.Poet: Just he try writing a lemon about Asuka 
	and I'll make sure that he lives through 
	the rest of his life as "Omelete Face"...
Wufei: Well, I don't know about the rest of you, 
	but I feel like kicking this guy's ass.
P.Poet: That isn't a bad idea.
The Rest: What isn't a bad idea?
P.Poet: Ladies and gentlemen; I have a proposal...

(The very next day...)

>Type type type type type<

Purge: More hentai! More orgies! More incest! 
	More pedophile sex acts! MORE!!! HAHAHA!!!

(A portal opens up behind Purge.)

Purge: Huh? What's going on?!

(Suddenly, hordes of mis-shapen hunchbacks pour 
out from the portal and buries Purge under their 
combined weight. More and more hunchbacks keep 
on streaming out.)

Hunchbacks: Duh duh duh duh duh...!!!!
Purge: ARRRRRRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!! GET OFF ME!!! GET 
	OFF ME!!!! 
P.Poet(As The Red Guy): Helloooooo......I see 
	that you are enjoying yourself, hmmmm?

(Out of the corner of his eye, Purge sees five 
figures standing a short distance away from the 
hunchback pile.)

Purge: WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE AND WHY ARE YOU DOING 
	THIS TO ME?!!!!
P.Poet: We, are the newly formed MST Avengers, 
	and we are here to mete out...
Wufei: ...JUSTICE!!!!!
P.Poet: Thank you, Wufei. You; did you really 
	think you could write literary bullshit 
	like "10-Chi Clan 'The Quickies'" without 
	getting any form of retribuition? Did you 
	think that we would stand by idly and do 
	nothing about it? I don't think so...
Purge: But I...
Lord Raptor: Save it, punk! Huh! Incest and 
	pedophilia! How LOW can ya GO?
Purge: I can explain!! It was, errr, these 
	voices in my head!! Yeah! Yeah, and 
	they told me: Purge, you must write 
	very, very dirty lemons filled with 
	incest and...
Asuka: You've been a bad boy...
Quatre: And as our duty, we will punish you 
	in the name of all the other respectable 
	fanfic writers out there!
Wufei: That's telling him, Quatre!
Purge: WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?!!
P.Poet: Oh, I don't know. That's up to my 
	hunchbacks to decide, heh heh...
Purge: AAAAHHHHH!!! THEY'RE DROOLING ON ME!!!!
Hunchbacks: Duh duh duh...
Asuka: Have a nice day...
Purge: NOOOOOOOO......!!!!!!!!

(A final muffled scream is heard as the MST 
Avengers exit Purge's house via a portal.)

Wufei: That felt good.
Asuka: Uh-huh.
P.Poet: We should do this more often.
Quatre: Yeah!
Lord Raptor: So youse sayin' that we make The 
	MST Avengers permanent?
P.Poet: Yep! Together, we shall crush all the 
	lousy fuck-a-minute fuck-a-thon lemons 
	and dispense...
Wufei: JUSTICE!!!!!
P.Poet: Thank you, Wufei. And dispense justice 
	to their shit-head writers!
All: Hear hear!!
Asuka: Be afraid, lemon writers. Be very afraid...
P.Poet: We'll be back!

================================================================================================

The Poet thanks:  First to be thanked is, of course, Minako, 
			for being a very accurate Laugh-o-meter. I 
			would also like to thank Asuka, Quatre, Wufei, 
			Lord Raptor and Washu-chan for showing up at 
			the MST. Thanks guys!!!
			
			Grudgingly, I "thank" Purge Raizah for writing 
			this piece of shit, because if it weren't for 
			his lemon, the MST Avengers wouldn't have come 
			together and had so much fun lambasting his fic. 
			Fuck you very much.

The Poet speaks:  Hope you readers will find this MST funny. 
			Enough people with big sledgehammers have 
			told me that I couldn't make a hyena laugh. 
			Even on a good day.
