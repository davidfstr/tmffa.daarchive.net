___________________________________________________________________________



Yet again it was just another normal day at the Masaki household.  Tenchi
just woke up to the sound of Ayeka and Ryoko fighting over him outside of
his door,

"God... Not those two fighting again!" complained Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: Ya! Not again!! another stupid begining like always!!

"I know they're fighting over me.. I love them both equally though.. or
do I?  I seem so attracted to Ryoko for some reason.  Maybe its because
she never had anyone to love her, and I feel like it is my duty to show
her affection, a feeling that no one has ever given her before." Tenchi
said to himself.

<Tenchi>: well i seem a little one-sided in this fic!
<Ayeka>: One sided on the wrong side too!!
<Ryoko>: I think not your Royal Bitchiness
<Ayeka>: GRRRRRR
<Ryoko>: GRRRRRR

"Hmmmm..." Tenchi sighed.

"Thats it!  Today im going to show her that I truly love her and end this
silly fighting!" exclaimed Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: oh just a LITTLE OOC

Tenchi then got dressed and snuck past Ryoko and Ayeka who were too busy
fighting to notice Tenchi.  On his way down to breakfast, a scary thought
popped up in Tenchi's mind,

"Oh no! That bitch Sakuya still thinks I love her!! AARRGG!" Tenchi thought
to himself.

<Tenchi>: Well thats not very nice!!
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: KILL THE BITCH!!
<Tenchi>: Ummm..

"Oh well.. HEHEHE I have the perfect plan!!" Tenchi said to himself as an
evil smile crossed his lips.

Just then, out of the blue, came Noboyuki wearing a pink tutu and holding
a paper mache wand,

<Ayeka>: Well that was a little blunt.
<Tenchi>: WTF is this author thinking?? My dad wearing a pink TUTU???
<Ryoko>: well you gotta remember, you said it yourself, this author
is phucked up!!

"AHAHAHAH!! I AM MAGICAL PRETTY GIRL NOBOYUKI!!!! AHAHAHAHAH" screamed a 
very deranged Noboyuki.

"I WILL MAKE EVERYONE LOVE EVERYONE!!!! AHAHHAHAHA!!!" screamed MPGNoboyuki
as he skipped out the front door and headed to the bus stop.  ((MPGNoboyuki 
stands for Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki, incase you didnt know :P) -AAA-PhuckNut)

<Ayeka>: I will make everyone love everyone?? boy that makes alot of sense
<Tenchi>: About as much sense as this fic does!

"Oh Great!! There goes dad acting insane again!! That dirty bastard!" Tenchi
yelled.

<Ryoko>: insane again?? what did i miss?

Tenchi ran to the kitchen and yelled to Sasami,

"Sasami! Quick call the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum!! Dad thinks he's
Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki again!!" Tenchi beamed.

<Tenchi>: this author belongs in the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum.
<Ayeka>: you said it..

"NOO!! Not again!! This could be dangerous!!" Sasami said.

Sasami then called the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum,

"Hello! and welcome to the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum automated commiting
a person to the asylum hotline!" said a robotic recording.

<Ryoko>: Well what do ya know.. it has its own hotline..

"If you are being murdered by an insane criminal, please press 1 now."
said the recording.

<Ayeka>: that joke was so funny, i forgot to laugh..

"If you are the insane person, please press 2 now." said the recording.

<Tenchi>: HAHAAH good one.. not.

"If Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki is on the loose again, please press
3 now." said the recording.

<Ayeka>: Oh look, it has its own button just for Noboyuki.
<Ryoko>: Makes sense, considering he goes insane everyday
<Tenchi>: Not

Sasami then pressed 3,

"Thank you for choosing 3, please hold for an operator!" said the
recording.

Sasami waited patiently while some elevator played over the phone.
Finally a operator came on,

<Tenchi>: while some elevator played over the phone?
<Ryoko>: some elevators played with each other!!
<Ayeka>: my god this authors an illiterate bastard!

"MGPNoboyuki is out again!!!" screamed the operator sounding very
scared.

"Yes he just came out!! He left the house and headed for the bus to
Tokyo!" yelled Sasami.

"OH GREAT!! THIS IS TERRIBLE!! Has he raped any small animals yet?!"
said the operator.

<Tenchi>: RAPING SMALL ANIMALS??? GROSS!!!
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!

"No, not that I know of.. But you better hurry before he does!!"
Sasmi said.


(But it was too late)

<Ayeka>: Oh great.. this is gonna be bad..
<Tenchi&Ryoko>: -gulp-
_________________________________________________________________________


MGPNoboyuki skipped along through the woods until he ran into a squirel,

"HELLO MR. SQUIREL!! I AM MAGICAL GIRL PRETTY NOBOYUKI! I WILL SHOW
YOU LOVE!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

<Ryoko&Ayeka>: your dad is wierd Tenchi!!
<Tenchi>: Umm.. What are you talking about? I dont know him.

The squirel shrieked in terror as MGPNoboyuki grabbed onto the squirel,
then he lifted his tutu and rammed his hard cock into the squirel's
ass,

<Tenchi>: NOOOOOOO!!!! GROOOOOOOOSSSS!!!!!!
<Ryoko>: -BARF-
<Ayeka>: OOHH MY VIRGIN EYES!!

"HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!!" yelled MGPNoboyuki.

MGPNoboyuki's penis ripped through the squirel's entire body and popped
out of the top of the squirel's head.  Then the squirels body split in half
and squirel blood covered MGPNoboyuki's cock.  MGPNoboyuki then took the
squirel's body and happily ate it,

<Tenchi&Ryoko&Ayeka>: -At this time they are not able to talk because
they are busy puking all over each other-

"IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW LOVE TO ALL THE CREATURES OF GODS PLANET!!" screamed
MGPNoboyuki.

He then skipped off down the trail to the bus.

__________________________________________________________________________


"Well, I guess we shouldn't worry too much now, Sasami." said Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN NOT WORRY!! Didnt you see what he
just did to that squirel!!!!
<Ryoko>: Umm Tenchi.. no he didnt.. he's inside the house..
<Tenchi>: Oh
<Ayeka>: -still puking-

"Yeah, I guess so..  The insane asylum should take care of everything."
said Sasami.

"But dont you remember what happend last time?" said Sasami.

"Yeah I know, it took 15 men to stop him from raping all those people in
Tokyo, they practically beat him to death with night sticks." said Tenchi.

<Ryoko>: Wow your dad can sure take a beating!
<Tenchi>: Or maybe cause this author is retarded, he just over-exagerated
when he said 15 men

"Well I hope they can fix him permanently this time!" exclaimed Sasami.

<Ayeka>: -done puking- What do they mean fix him permanently? As in 
killing him??

"Me too.  Well I have to go take care of some business, Ill see ya later
Sasami." said Tenchi.

<Ryoko>: Well if it is killing him, then Tenchi seems to aggree.
<Tenchi>: I do not aggree to kill my dad!! Well, maybe the version
of my dad in this fic..

"Ok Tenchi see ya later!" Sasami said.

Tenchi then left the kitchen and headed up the stairs to Ryoko's room.
Tenchi arrived at her room and opened the door, and she wasnt there,

"Hmm, she must be at her favorite tree, ill go there." Tenchi said to
himself.

<Ryoko>: I have a favorite tree?
<Tenchi>: I guess so.

Tenchi then went downstairs and headed out the door, avoiding Ayeka, who 
was sitting on the couch watching TV.  Tenchi got outside safely and went
to Ryoko's favorite tree, and he saw her laying up there on a branch,

<Ayeka>: I do not just sit on the couch and watch TV all day!!

"Wow, she is so beautiful." Tenchi thought to himself when he saw her.

<Tenchi>: Gee ya think?
<Ryoko>: -blushes-
<Ayeka>: -starts to get angry-

"Hey Ryoko!" yelled Tenchi.

Ryoko turned her head towards him, and then she saw it was Tenchi and
she said,

"Oh hi Tenchi!" then she teleported down next to him.

"What brings you here?" asked Ryoko when she got next to him.

<Tenchi>: Well I came to tell you that my dad has gone insane!

"Well, I was wondering if you wanted to take a walk with me, because
I have to tell you something.

<Tenchi>: Ok maybe not, I guess I just forgot about my dad..

"Ok, sure." Ryoko said, sounding a little bit suprised.

They started to walk down a trail that leaded into the forest, then Tenchi
spoke up,

<Ayeka>: doesnt he mean, a trail that LEAD into the forest?
<Ryoko>: Like you said before, hes an illiterate bastard.

"Ryoko, what I wanted to tell you was that.. umm.. I..."

Ryoko's heart started to flutter when she heard him say this,

<Ryoko>: Oh no im having a heart attack!!!

"I love you!" exclaimed Tenchi.

<Ayeka>: HOW COULD YOU LOVE THAT DEMON!!
<Tenchi>: Please Ayeka!! Its just the version of me in the fic!!
<Ayeka>: Oh im sorry Lord Tenchi, I completely forgot, I know that you
could never love that witch in real life.
<Ryoko>: Who are you calling a witch you bitch!!
<Tenchi>: hehe you rymed.
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: GRRRRRR

"Oh Tenchi!! You dont know how long I have waited for you to say that!!
I love you so much too!!" exclaimed a VERY happy Ryoko.

<Ryoko>: Yeah! I waited 2 minutes for you to say it!!
<Tenchi>: wow, long time!!

They then hugged each other and gazed into one another's eyes.  Their 
faces slowly came closer and closer together until their lips were touching,
then they went into a deep kiss.  As they kissed, Ryoko moved her hands 
all over Tenchi's chest, slowly moving downward untill she put her hands
into his pants and massaged his growing erection,

<Ayeka>: YOU SHE-DEMON!!

"Oh TENCHI!! I want you so bad!!" exclaimed Ryoko.

"oh umm.. HEHE.. umm HEH." said a very nervous Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: DUH HEHE DUH IM AAA-PhuckNut AND IM UMM.. HEHE.. STUPID!!

Ryoko then teleported them both to Tenchi's room, and she layed him
down on the bed and she started to strip,

<Ryoko>: Go me!! Go me!!
<Ayeka>: You shutup!!

"mmmmmm.." Ryoko moaned as she stripped her clothes off.

<Ryoko>: mmmmmm that cinamon bun is delicious!! Oh sorry Tenchi!! I 
forgot that I was supposed to be stripping for you!!

"My god.. she is so fucking gorgeous!!" Tenchi though to himself.

<Tenchi>: Wow ya just notice that??

Ryoko finished taking her clothes off and started to take Tenchis off.
She took his pants off and then got on top of him, stradling his waist.
She then slowly sat on Tenchi's cock,

<Ayeka>: Crushing it into a bloody mess!!
<Tenchi>: -shudders-
<Ryoko>: You dirty minded princess!!
<Ayeka>: You filthy space slut!!
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: GRRRRRRRRRRR

 sliding it up her wet, tight, virgin
pussy.

"oooohhh Tenchi, ive always wanted my first to be with you." said Ryoko.

<Ryoko>: Yes, even when I was just 5 years old, I knew all about you Tenchi.
<Tenchi>: Obviously this author knows nothing about time..
<Ayeka>: Obviously -she said using a fake snobby voice-

"Ive always wanted my first to be with you too." said Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: I also knew all about you too Ryoko, when I was 5 years old!

"Wow she's a virgin?? I never would have guessed that by the way she acts!"
Tenchi thought to himself.

<Ayeka>: Yeah! Ryoko the space slut!
<Ryoko>: GRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Ryoko started to bounce on him faster and faster,

"RYOKO!! YES!!!" screamed Tenchi as he blew his load into her.

<Tenchi>: my load of what??
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: Tenchi, your so hopeless..

"OOOOOHH YESSSS TENCHIIIIIII!!" screamed Ryoko as she orgasmed shortly after
Tenchi.

Then they slowed down and got off each other and went into a deep kiss,

<Ryoko>: Well that was some short sex..
<Ayeka>: Well what would you expect from a dirty tramp like you!!
<Tenchi>: Girls!! please calm down!!

"I love you so much!" said Ryoko.

"I love you too Ryoko, that was soooo good..." said Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: yes for the 3 minutes it lasted, it was good..

Then they kissed each other some more and eventually fell asleep...

____________________________________________________________________________


MGPNoboyuki neared the bus stop, he had already raped 3 squirels, 2 dogs, and
a goat,

<Tenchi>: GOD THATS JUST WRONG!!!!
<Ryoko>: Wow Tenchi! Your dad sure gets around!!
<Tenchi>: GRRRRRRRRRRR

"NOW I WILL GO TO THE CITY AND SHOW LOVE TO EVERYONE!!! AHAHAHHAHAHA!" screamed
MGPNoboyuki.

Just as he got close to the bus stop, he saw the all to common sight, to him, of
the white paddy wagon with its sirens on speeding his way,

<Ayeka>: Yes, Noboyuki sees white paddy wagons speeding at him everyday..

"THE ANTI-LOVE MEN HAVE COME TO STOP MY LOVE!! I MUST RUN!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

<Ayeka>: oh yay! the anti-love men!! what an orginal name!!
<Tenchi>: More like a super-retarded name...

He then ran back as fast as he could to the house.  When he got to the house and
came to the front gate he saw Azaka and Kamidake.

"AHAHAHA!! I MUST SHOW MY FRIENDS LOVE!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki as he headed
right towards Azaka.

<Ryoko>: Somehow I feel this isnt going to be pretty..

"Ah, greetings sir!" said Azaka as MGPNoboyuki headed towards him.

"Um sir? May I ask why you are wearing that womans dress?" asked Azaka.

<Ayeka>: Because hes insane obviously!!

"I WILL SHOW YOU LOVE MY LOG FRIEND!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Azaka screamed.

<Tenchi>: Oh god!
<Ayeka>: -covers her eyes-

MGPNoboyuki quickly grabbed ahold of Azaka, and plunged his penis into
Azaka's little electric eye thingy.  His penis shattered the glass eye,
and destroyed all the electronics inside.  MGPNoboyuki was in pure
ecstasy as the broken glass and sharp electric components ripped up his
penis.  Blood started pouring from his penis,

<Tenchi>: OH YES!! pure ecstasy!! my penis is being shredded up!! OH YES!!
<Ryoko>: -puke- -barf-
<Ayeka>: is it over yet?? -eyes still closed-

"AHHHHHHHH-----" was all Azaka could say before he lost power.

Kamidake was smart and already ran away when MGPNoboyuki attacked Azaka.
MGPNoboyuki pulled his penis out of Azaka and cried at what he saw,

<Tenchi>: Oh really? he just noticed that? I guess he cant feel his penis..

"NOOOOO MY LOVE STICK HAS BEEN DESTROYED!! HOW CAN I SHOW LOVE TO 
EVERYONE NOW??!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

<Ryoko>: Thank god!! maybe now that he cant do anything this stupid
fic will end!!

MGPNoboyuki's penis was a bloody mangled mess of shreds of skin and stuff.

<Ayeka>: -opens eyes, only to see that sight-  -PUKE BARF-

"I GOT IT!! I WILL JUST MAKE MYSELF BECOME REBORN SO I WILL HAVE A NEW
LOVE STICK!!!!" exclaimed a very happy MGPNoboyuki.

<Tenchi>: Riiiiiight....

MGPNoboyuki then ran into the house and into the kitchen, where Sasami
was,

"Oh no!!!! HES HERE!!!" screamed Sasami, unfortuneatly no one heard her.

"YOU WILL HOLD MY REBORN FETUS!!!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

<Ryoko>: YUUCK!!!!!!
<Tenchi>: eeeewwwwwwwww

He then grabbed a knife and sliced his scrotum off.  He took his nuts
and broke them open and grabbed onto Sasami and shoved them up her 
pussy,

<Ryoko>: bbbbbllaaaaaacccccchhhh -ryoko then puked some more-
<Tenchi>: -balls up and starts crying-
<Ayeka>: -gets back up from puking, sees the screen, pukes more-

"OH GOD HELP MEEEEEEEEE!!!!!" screamed Sasami.

"AHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHA!!!!! NOW TO GO BECOME REBORN!!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

MGPNoboyuki then ran out of the house with the knife and stabbed himself
in the head so that he could be reborn.  Then knife punctured the side
of his skull and went straight through his brain, he died a few seconds
later.  Of course, he was insane and he wasnt reborn..

<Ryoko>: That was fucking nasty!!!!!!
<Ayeka>: Tenchi are you crying??
<Tenchi>: -gets up real fast and wipes tears away- NO! of course not!!
why would i ever cry?!?!

_________________________________________________________________________


Tenchi woke up and looked over to see Ryoko still asleep.  Just then
Ayeka burst into the room and saw a naked Tenchi and Ryoko hugging
each other in bed.

"YOU DEMON!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO TENCHI!!" screamed Ayeka.

<Ayeka>: You tell her girlfriend!!

"AYEKA!!" Tenchi yelled.

"Its.. its not her fault Ayeka.. I love her Ayeka.." Tenchi confessed.

<Ayeka>: TENCHI!! YOU WHAT?!?!?!?
<Tenchi>: AYEKA!! calm down!! its JUST THE FIC!!!
<Ayeka>: oh right.. im sorry again Tenchi

Ayeka ran out of the room crying and ran out of the house past 
Noboyuki's bloody corpse, not even caring about it.  Ayeka headed out
into the woods and found a tree and sat by it.

<Ryoko>: Yes, no one cares about Noboyuki's body.

"WHYYY!!! WHY DOES HE LOVE HER!!!!!!" screamed Ayeka.

<Ryoko>: Because im so much better, obviously!!
<Ayeka>: you are not better than me!!!!
<Ryoko&Ayeka>: GRRRRRRRRRRRRR

"How could he fall in love with that... that.. that DEMON!!" screamed
Ayeka.

Ayeka cried some more, then decided that she didnt belong here anymore.

<Ryoko>: She never did in the first place! its about time she finally
realized it!!
<Ayeka>: YOU SHUTUP!!
<Tenchi>: Please stop fighting!!

"He doesnt love me.. he loves HER.. I dont need to stay here.. IM
LEAVING!!" yelled Ayeka.

And at that she went back to the house and found Sasami balled up in
a corner crying her eyes out,

<Ryoko>: Id be crying too, if Noboyuki did that to me!

"Sasami!! Lets go we are leaving!!" yelled Ayeka.

Ayeka then grabbed Sasami and they left, never to return.

<Ryoko>: Good riddens to bad rubbish!!
<Ayeka>: THATS IT!! -Ayeka then got up and slapped Ryoko-
<Ryoko>: You prissy little princess!! you dare slap me!!!!
<Tenchi>: GIRLS!!! STOP NOW!!!!!!
-suprisingly the girls stop, and then sit back down-

__________________________________________________________________________


"Theres still one thing I have to do, my love" Tenchi said to a sleeping
Ryoko.

"I must KILL THAT SAKUYA BITCH!!" screamed Tenchi, almost waking Ryoko up.

<Ayeka&Ryoko>: Finally!! Something redeeming about this fic!!

Tenchi then went to the phone and called up his 'old friend'.

"Hello? God father?" said Tenchi.

<Tenchi>: Hello? God? could you please strike Sakuya with lightning?

"hmm Tenchi is that you?" said the voice with a heavy italian accent.

"Yes, it is I, I need you to 'take care' of someone for me."

<Tenchi>: Yes, it is I, I it is
<Ryoko&Ayeka> -sigh-

Tenchi then told what he wanted to his Italian friend.

<Tenchi>: I want a million bucks, and a pony!!
<Ryoko as Italian guy>: Sure thing sonny!!
<Ayeka>: Hmmm.. GAY?
<Tenchi&Ryoko> -shocked by what Ayeka just said-

___________________________________________________________________________


Sakuya sat in her shitty little hovel she calls home,

<Tenchi>: her shitty little hovel was practically the same as mine
in Tenchi in Tokyo..
<Ryoko>: Tell me about it..

 thinking about
Tenchi, when she heard a knock on the door.  Sakuya went and answered the
door and saw 2 tall, strong looking, italian men wearing very expensive
looking suits, and black sun glasses.

<Ayeka>: The mafia!!
<Ryoko>: Say hello to my little friend!!
<Tenchi>: -sigh- Too many bad jokes... -sigh-

"Good day miss, you must be Sakuya?" said the first man.

<Ryoko, as sakuya>: No im Janet Reno, cant you tell?  fucking idiots..

"Yes my name is Sakuya. May I help you?" said a puzzled Sakuya.

"Would you please come with us? A man named Tenchi would like to see you."
said the man.

Sakuya didnt want to go..

<Ayeka&Ryoko>: Because she really hates Tenchi!!
<Tenchi>: hmm...

 but then she heard him say Tenchi wanted to see
her, so she went with them.  They arrived outside and they went over to
the shiny black car, with black tinted windows.  She got in the back and 
noticed there was a driver already waiting in the car.

<Tenchi>: well isnt that just dandy..

The ride was totally silent untill they reached their destination, but
Sakuya was puzzled.. 

"Why are we at the docks?" asked Sakuya.

<Ayeka>: Because we're in the mafia and your gonna get some cement
shoes!!

"Your friend Tenchi is waiting for you on a yacht out at sea, we will get
on a boat and head out to him." said one of the men.

"Oh ok." said Sakuya.

<Ryoko>: Boy, Sakuya sure is smart, going far out to sea with some
people she doesnt even know!
<Tenchi>: She's majorly OOC...

They hopped on a motor boat and headed out to the yacht.  They finally 
arrived at the yacht.

"Come, your friend awaits you." said one of the men.

Sakuya and the men stepped off the boat and onto the yacht.

"Please wait here while I go and get him." said one of the men.

The man walked around to the other side of the captains area.

<Ayeka>: The captains area, isnt it called the bridge??

"Please follow me." said one of the men standing next to Sakuya.

<Tenchi>: didnt they just tell her to wait there?
<Ryoko>: they're just stupid and cant make up their minds..

"Ok." said Sakuya as she followed him.

They headed around to the other side where the other guy had gone, 
then Sakuya noticed a box with what looked like wet cement inside it.

"What is that? It looks like cement." asked Sakuya.

<Ayeka>: Wow very observant my young apprentice

All of the sudden one of the men grabbed Sakuya and shoved her feet into
the wet cement.

"AHHHHHHH!!! what are you doing!!" screamed Sakuya.

<Ryoko>: Giving you some cement shoes! DUH!!

Then one of the guys stuck duct tape over her mouth.  Then all 3 of them
pulled out their pistols and started shooting her in the legs, filling her
legs with hot lead.

<Tenchi>: ouch..

"MMMPPPPPHHH" Sakuya screamed in pain.

Blood poured from her legs, then one man grabbed a crowbar and started to
beat her in the spine with it.  The sound of bones cracking could be heard
very clearly.

<Ayeka>: the wonderful sound of cracking bones..
<Ryoko>: -snap- -crack-!!

  Then they strapped a bomb to her that was set to detonate
when her heartbeat slowed almost to stopping, but not quite.

<Tenchi>: I guess they just had all this sitting around..

  They shot her 
in the arms some more, then threw her into the ocean once the cement dried.  
She sunk like a rock,

<Tenchi>: Well she did have a giant rock on her feet!!

 screaming all the way down, she started losing oxygen
quickly,

<Ayeka>: Really? what ever gave the author the idea that she might 
lose oxygen while under water?

 and her blood filled the water, her heart slowed way down and then
the bomb detonated filling  the water with blood and chunks of her body.

<Ryoko>: What a pretty picture. -puke-

Then extremely hungry sharks arrived and ate her remaining body parts.
That was the end of Sakuya!!

<Ayeka&Ryoko>: Yay.

((YES AHAHHAHAHAHAAH!!! SAKUYA THE BITCH IS DEAD!!! HAHHHAHAHAHA) 
- AAA-PhuckNut)

<Ayeka&Ryoko>: Maybe he isnt as stupid as we thought?
<Tenchi>: Nah, hes still pretty stupid..
<Ayeka&Ryoko>: yup..

____________________________________________________________________________


Tenchi and Ryoko were married and lived happily ever after, having
8 kids.

<Ryoko>: YAY!
