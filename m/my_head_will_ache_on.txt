Dammit Jim! I'm a writer, not a miracle worker!

OK, Mr. Moore decided to make things hard on me in revenge for "Who Let the Dogs 
Out" by making me spoof "My Heart Will Go On", the horrifically overplayed theme 
from the horrifically overrated "Titanic". (I worked in a music store when this 
came out).  So please forgive this songfic, I promise my next one will be 
better.  

DISCLAIMER: Tenchi Muyo! and all original characters therein are copyright 
Pioneer and AIC.  "My Heart Will Go On" copyright Will Jennings, Celine Dion, 
and Famous Music Corp. (famous for overplaying songs one should only hear once a 
year).  This songfic copyright Ian Sagat 2001.

Sigh.  OK here goes.

"MY HEAD WILL ACHE ON"

A SONGFIC BY: Ian Sagat

(Tenchi)
Every night in my room, I see you, I fear you,
This is how my headache comes on.
Far across the distance, good silence, I miss this,
You have come to make my head throb.

Near, far, wherever you are,
I need Aleve to make headache be gone.
Once more, you phase through the door,
You're here in the bathroom,
Now my head will ache on and on...

You can touch me one time, and she'll yell loud each time,
And my head will ache 'till she's gone.
Silence, how I loved you, one true time I hold to,
But in my life I know that it's gone.

Near, far, wherever they are,
I know that my head will ache on.
Blue, red, I wish I were dead,
But my head will ache on and on...

(Louder Now)
They're all here, the gang has appeared,
And I know that the worst is the blonde.
And I'll stay forever this way,
As long as they live here,
My headache goes on and ooooooooonnnn...



OK that's it...that wasn't so bad.  I guess.  As you may have guessed, this song 
is about Tenchi's lack of peace and quiet and how he must miss it.  Sure, he 
loves them all, but come on, I'd go nuts with all that racket all the time.  OK 
until next time, Sayonara!
