Ode to Washu: The Helpless Young Child.

Author's note: I love Washu, but Though she's my favorite, I don't think 
she's Tenchi's type. This is to celebrate all that is Washu. Washu and 
Ryoko are trademarks of Tenchi Muyo! and Pioneer. PS: 'Her skyes' 
referring to her own little worlds. ^_~


A helpless young child,
You think that is true?
She wont help you unless,
You call her little Washu!

A mischievous grin,
Long red spiky hair,
She needs a guinea pig,
Come in if you dare.

#1 in the universe,
The smartest that there is.
Her gears are always turning,
She's a scientist wiz.

She created Ryoko,
She created her skyes.
But there's more than just science,
In those emerald eyes.

A sad hidden past,
Haunts her dreams late at night.
A little blonde baby,
Now gone from her sight.

She pretends to be carefree,
Silly and wild.
The centuries of hiding,
As a helpless young child.

THE END
