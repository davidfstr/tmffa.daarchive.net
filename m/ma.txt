	"Stop fidgeting!!" Washu commanded.
	"Hurry up then!" Ryoko retorted. "I don't see why I have to
do this! I mean, this is so pointless!"
	Ryoko was sitting on the couch in the middle of Tenchi's
living room with a large orange sphere with legs and blinking 
'eyes' sitting on her head.
	It was a couple of days after the whole Zero/Dr. Clay/Lady
Tokimi incident. Washu had been in the middle of recording any
differences in the girl's bodies after coming to live with Tenchi
and was now finishing her interrupted data gathering.
	Sasami was in the kitchen with Ryo-ohki, making dinner
while Tenchi was in the fields. Mihoshi was still delivering her
report to the Galaxy Police and had not returned yet. 
	Washu found that, much to her surprise, she actually missed
the blonde. Without her around, there wasn't a very handy supply
of comical relief. One could only laugh at Tenchi's father's
idiocy so many times.
	~Oh well,~ Washu thought to herself as she punched in a few
keys, ~at least she isn't around to screw up my experiments.~
	Aeyka was standing a few feet away, a grin on her face.
~If I had to suffer through that indignity,~ she thought to 
herself, ~then so does SHE.~
	Suddenly, there was a loud beeping sound coming from Washu's
computer. Washu, Aeyka and Ryoko all turned to look at it.
	Washu read the readout, and a wry grin came on her face.
She went over to her daughter, who was getting nervous now, and
looked her up and down.
	"Just like I thought," Washu announced. "Your breasts ARE
sagging." 
	Ryoko jumped to her feet, and grabbed Washu's shirt,
hoisting her up a few feet into the air. "WHAT?!" She screamed.
	Aeyka snickered.

*****************************************************************

	Washu transferred the data from her lap top over to her
main computer in her laboratory. She lounged on her floating
cushion, and waited impatiently.
	*Done* beeped the computer.
	~Finally,~ Washu thought to herself. She called up her
daughter's profile up just to look over it, and found herself
smiling proudly at the data.
	~Poor Ryoko,~ Washu thought as she gave a giggle. In truth,
the ex-space pirate's breasts really weren't sagging. 
	~It's just so fun to tease her!~
	Sighing, Washu idly drummed her fingers as she finished
reading the data.
	"I wonder if my first child would have turned out like
Ryoko..." Washu said to herself. She blinked when she realized
what she had been saying.
	Her mind's eye could see a picture of her adorable little
baby, with his father's wavy blonde hair, and her own sharp 
green eyes.
	Sitting up, Washu called up another file.
	It was a very old file, close to 20 000 years old, and it
hadn't been touched in 5 000 years, ever since Washu had been
imprisoned by Kagato.
	"I guess it's time for an update," Washu mused as she
opened the file.
	The file was one that kept track of her first child's
blood line. She had watched as he grew up, fell in love, found
a wife, and had kids. Then, Washu had done the same with her
child's children, and then their children, and so on so forth.
	She didn't know why she had decided to keep track of
her descendants. It was just something she felt like doing, 
and, for some reason, made her feel better.
	"Hmm... since the last entry, there were close to 1000
descendants..." Washu mused, "I wonder how many there are now?"
	Washu started to check birth and death records, the
science academy's records, galaxy police records... anything.
	The descendants had continued to multiply, and, five
hundred years after Washu had been imprisoned by Kagato, there
were almost 5 000 descendants, with most of them living on one
planet.
	It had been difficult, trying to keep track of so many
people, but Washu, being the greatest scientific mind in the
universe, managed to do it easily.
	Washu gave a smirk as she looked over pictures of a few
of her descendants. 
	~Almost ALL of them have the same wavy blonde hair,~ 
Washu thought to herself. ~Despite having the blood line mix for 
so many centuries. That blonde hair must have been a VERY 
predominant gene!~
	Washu decided that her intelligence hadn't been a very
predominant gene. Only a few of her descendants had managed
to become distinguished in their lifetime.
	"Must have been the wealth, prestigious family ways," Washu 
muttered acidly to herself. "Rots their minds."
	Washu frowned when she read that the planet most of her
descendants lived on had been destroyed by Kagato, 2 000 years
after she had been imprisoned.
	It had been easy to track down the descendants after that,
for only a few dozen descendants continued to live. 
	They had lost all of their wealth and prestige, and the
descendants that were left had all become part of the working
class.
	Washu found this rather ironic. ~A prestigious clan
refuses my marriage with my husband, because of my social 
standing. Then, I become the most respected scientist in the 
universe, while they all become working class.~
	The last descendants steadily dwindled down over the next
3 000 years, until only one family was left.
	"A rich, proud clan, whose numbers used to be in the
thousands..." Washu said to herself, "now, only one single
family is left."
	She felt strangely sad, for some reason, but her mood
brightened when she found that, this one family had managed to
find their way back to the top once more, not by birthright,
or inheritance, but rather, through hard work and endurance.
	Washu felt a surge of pride when she found a family
picture. 
	An older man with blonde but graying hair and sparkling 
eyes was standing proudly. 
	In front of him sat a younger woman with blonde wavy hair 
(one of Washu's direct descendants, no doubt) and brown eyes. A 
blue haired man with soft blue eyes, who was about the same
age as the woman sat beside her. They were holding onto a small 
baby with blonde wavy hair and blue eyes.
	Washu learned that both the mother and father of the little
baby died a few years after the picture was taken, leaving the
grandfather to take care of the baby.
	Gato Kuramitsu was the name of the old man. He was the 
Chief of the Galaxy Police Force, and his granddaughter, the 
little baby in the picture, was a first class detective named-
	Washu froze. ~No,~ she thought. ~It COULDN'T be.~
	Mihoshi Kuramitsu.
	Washu's descendant, Gato Kuramitsu, the Chief of the Galaxy
Police Force, had a first class detective for a granddaughter,
named Mihoshi Kuramitsu. The same Mihoshi Kuramitsu who was 
currently assigned to protect the Earth, and was living with
one Tenchi Masaki.
	Which meant that the ditzy blonde Washu often couldn't stand
was actually the scientist's own flesh and blood!
	~Nooooo!!!!~

AUTHOR'S NOTES:  So whaddya think? I just came up with this little
thing after finished watching Tenchi Muyo OAV #8 and saw a picture
of Washu's first child, and noticed that he had similar hair to
a certain first class detective we all know and love/hate.
	Comments? Criticism? Please?
