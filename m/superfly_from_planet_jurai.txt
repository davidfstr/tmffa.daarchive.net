Notes:
This is my first Tenchi Songfic and my forth Songfic all together
(Having already done the Evangelion, Urasai Yatsura, and Ranma 1/2
parodies) Eventually they'll all be part of a songfic album, but I'm
rambling...

The Superfly from Planet Jurai
A Tenchi Muyo! Songfic
By 
BoneparteOzaki
Based on
"Pretty Fly for a White Guy"
by Offspring

Ryoko: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Aeka: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Washu: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
And all the ladies say he's the superfly from Planet Jurai...
 
You Know it's kinda hard
If you live out in the sticks
Our hero isn't cool
but he still gets all the chicks
He doesn't have the look
and some say that he's gay
but what he does have
is Juraian DNA!

Refrain:
There's a debate, if this guy's straight
but he gets all the girlies anyway
He can't seem to pick, a single chick
for them no way, for them no way
What he don't know, is they'll all go
they should all be on the Jerry Springer Show
The girls love their Tenchi
So, hey hey, do that Light Hawk thing!

Mihoshi: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Kiyone: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Sasami: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
And all the ladies say he's the superfly from Planet Jurai...

He needs a new sword
Not just any will defend
So he went to Yosho's cave
and took the Tenchi-ken
Now cruising in Ryo-Ohki, He see ladies at the shrine
He's a lucky bastard
but all he does is whine!

Refrain:
There's a debate, if this guy's straight
but he gets all the girlies anyway
He can't seem to pick, a single chick
for them no way, for them no way
What he don't know, is they'll all go
they should all be on the Jerry Springer Show
The girls need their Tenchi
So, hey hey, do that Light Hawk thing!

He's got a brand new series
"Shin Tenchi" is it's name
We wanted something new, but this is really lame
Why Pioneer did this
we really can't say
why won't they finish
The ^%#$@ING OVA'S!?!?!

Sakuya: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Miyuka: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
Ryo-Ohki: Give it to me Tenchi![Tenchi: nuh uh, nuh uh!)
And all the ladies say he's the superfly from Planet Jurai...

Refrain:
There's a debate, if this guy's straight
but he gets all the girlies anyway
He can't seem to pick, a single chick
for them no way, for them no way
What he don't know, is they'll all go
they should all be on the Jerry Springer Show
The girls need their Tenchi
The girls love their Tenchi
Let's all watch some more Tenchi
So, hey hey, do that Light Hawk thing!
