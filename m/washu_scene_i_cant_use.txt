Here's a scene I'd love to use in a Tenchi 'fic.  Unfortunately, I don't
have any good ideas for stories that would include this scene.

Okay, the setup:  Washu's old flame/scientific rival shows up.  (I'm
imagining this little guy with Beakman-like hair and huge round glasses.)
After arguing about various theories, passions ignite.  The next day...

[Washu leaves her lab.  Aeka, Ryoko, and Sasami are in the room.]

Washu: Has anyone seen (name)?

Aeka: He said he had to go back to his ship.  He left this card.

[Washu opens the card and reads it.  She blushes.]

Washu (giggling): Oh, he's such a hopeless romantic!!

[An alarm goes off inside the lab.]

Washu: Ah!  My experiment!

[She runs off, dropping the card.  The girls pick it up and read it.  It
says:
        "Roses are red"
        "Violets are blue"
        (indechiperable mathematical equation)
        "and so are you".]
