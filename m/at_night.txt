At Night
By Carrie Amoroso (Pixiestaro0o@alo.com)


He sleeps.
My Tenchi, My love, My life.
I wish he could understand how much I need him.
Everyday it gets harder to be around him,
Not being able to hold him without him trying to run.
Not being able to kiss him, to show him my love, my soul.

Does he know that every night I watch him, protect him?
Does he know that I'd die a hundred times for him?
That I'd do anything so he could be happy,
Even if that means I have to step aside so he can be with Ayeka.

I don't think he knows.
I don't think he knows how important he is to me.
I don't think he knows that I'd give everything up for him,
My happiness, my reason to live, I'd give it all up,
Just so he could be happy.

But for now he sleeps.
Unaware of my presence, of my devotion.
He doesn't want to know.
He want to be free, a normal teenager.
So I'm going to let him be one,
No more seducing, no more embarrassing whispers,
No more clinging to his arm, no more pressure to choose,
No more spying or surprising him while is changing his cloths,
And no more fighting with Ayeka.

So tonight is the last night, the last night I will protect you, Tenchi
No more watching you
So good night my Tenchi, my Prince
Tomorrow you won't have to worry
No pressure to choose I promise
You can be you, the person I love
You don't have to worry about anything but the present
No demands for your attention or asking for your love
Just remember To follow your heart and when the time comes,
Don't worry about hurting me

I love you Tenchi,
You are my life.
And if you do anything tomorrow,
Just remember to be happy.
With or without me.
