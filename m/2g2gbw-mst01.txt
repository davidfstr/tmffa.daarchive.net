(Scene opens with a man in a black trench coat onboard the satellite, 
Deep Six-Nine.  The man is facing a viewscreen with Washu's face on 
it.)

CAVIS:  So let me see if I got this straight... (Looks around the 
satellite.  He is a tall, blonde man in a black trench coat.)  All I 
have to do is stay up here for six hours with my favorite anibabe of 
all time without making a move on her, and I win, right?
WASHU:  (On the screen in front of Cavis.)  That's right!  But don't 
worry, you won't be totally alone up there.  (Presses a few buttons 
on her computer.  Suddenly a portal opens up and Davner, a dark-haired 
man in gray trenchcoat, falls from the ceiling and lands in front of 
Cavis.)
DAVNER:  (From the ground.)  Thanks....Washu....I think.
WASHU:  Don't mention it.
CAVIS:  Dav?
DAVNER:  (Gets up and dusts himself off.)  Even'n, Cav.
CAVIS:  What the hell are you doing here?!
DAVNER:  I'm in the same boat you are, Cav.  You're here to prove you 
love Meg by holding out against Ryoko.  Ayeka, apparently, heard about 
this and decided it was a good idea.  (Rolls his eyes.)  So if *I* can 
hold out against my favorite anibabe, she'll date me.
CAVIS:  That's....great....I think...
DAVNER:  (Shrugs)  Best deal so far.  She says I must prove I can, and 
I quote, "Curb my *marital impulses.*  Unquote.  (Cavis gives him a 
look.)  Well, come on, Cav, that's about as racy as Ayeka gets.
CAVIS:  Heh.
WASHU:  (Is speaking with Ryoko off camera.)  Yup, that's the deal.
RYOKO:  So, all I have to do is pretend I like this guy for six hours 
and hit on him until he makes a move, then Ayeka will *give me* Tenchi?
WASHU:  (Nods.)
RYOKO:  Where do I sign up?!
WASHU:  You just did.  (Presses a button on her holotop and Ryoko 
disappears, reappearing on the satellite next to Cavis and Davner.)
RYOKO:  (Glomps Davner)  Hey, sweetie pie!!
DAVNER:  (Points to Cavis.)  You're looking for him, darl'n.
RYOKO:  Oh....(Glomps Cavis.)  Hey, sweetie pie!!
WASHU:  Now for you, Davner....
DAVNER:  (Grins.)  Do your worst!
WASHU:  (Grins back)  If you insist...  (Presses a few buttons on her 
holotop.  In a flash of light, Afura Mann from El Hazard appears.)
AFURA:  What the hell....
DAVNER:  (Tenses.  He begins taking deep breaths.)  Eyes on the prize, 
eyes on the prize....
AFURA:  Um...excuse me, who are you people?
CAVIS:  (Explains the situation to Afura while Davner searches the 
Satellite for a cold shower.)
AFURA:  (Folds arms over her chest.)  You have got to be kidding me.
CAVIS:  (Shakes his head.)  Nope, sorry.
AFURA:  (Begins rubbing her temples.)  This is a bad dream...it's 
*just* a bad dream...
WASHU:  And, now, just to make it all that much more 
special.....JINNAI!!!
AFURA:  GOD IN HEAVEN, NO!!!
JINNAI:  (Appears in a ball of light.)  What the hell is this!?  
(Clenches fists.)  Ooooooh!!!  Makoto Mizuhara is behind all this!!!  
I just know it!!!
AFURA:  (Growls.)  You know, not *everything* is about MAKOTO 
MIZUHARA!!!!
JINNAI:  (Crosses arms over his chest.)  Well, well, if it isn't the 
wind harpy....
AFURA:  (Raises arm and wind blasts Jinnai into a far wall.  She takes 
a breath and turns to Cav.)  Okay, this is only for six hours right?  
Then they send me home?
CAVIS:  Right.
AFURA:  Fine, whatever.  Now what do we do?
DAVNER:  (can be heard from down the hall)  Must....resist.. ...
temptation!
AFURA:  Um...is he going to be okay?
WASHU:  I guess that's up to you.  Anyway, as long as you're up there, 
we've got some entertainment for you.
JINNAI:  Hmmmm....With a space station like this, I could bombard 
Roshtaria from above...
AFURA:  (Sighs in frustration.)
RYOKO:  What kind of entertainment, Mom?
WASHU:  Simple, Ryoko.  We'll send you fics.
RYOKO:  (Smiles)  Great!  Whatcha got?  Aiken Muyo?  Ryoko's Love?
WASHU:  Mihoshi!  What fic are we sending?
MIHOSHI:  (Appears on screen holding a fic.)  One of *my* personal 
favorites........Tenchi Muyo in Life!!!
RYOKO:  (Smiles)  No, really, which fic?
MIHOSHI:  (Blinks)  Um....that one.
CAVIS:  (Looks up at the sky.)  Son of a bitch!  I *knew* it!
RYOKO:  (Stops smiling.)  Okay, *Mom*, I've changed my mind.  Get me 
down from here.
WASHU:  Sorry, Ryoko.  Too late for that.  Now get in the theatre.
RYOKO:  Make us!
WASHU:  (frowns and presses a button on her holotop.  Suddenly, 
tentacles bearing spinning saw blades emerge from the walls.  They move 
towards the group threateningly.)
RYOKO:  (Sweatdrops.)  Well, I guess it's off to the theatre!  Come on, 
sweetie!  (Grabs Cavis and walks into the theatre.)

<AFURA> Am I sensing hostility here?
<RYOKO> You betcha. 
<AFURA> I thought you were finally getting some out of him though 
after Tenchi Forever?
<RYOKO> That's "TV Ryoko." I'm "OVA Ryoko." Big difference. (sighs)
<DAVNER> Well atleast Jinnai is getting some from Diva finally.
<JINNAI> The only reason for that is so we can repopulate the Bugrom 
Empire!
<CAVIS> So you're saying that you're not interested in sleeping with 
Diva for her looks.
<JINNAI> Well... um... of course not!
<RYOKO> (sigh) What is it the people who don't want any get some and 
the ones who want it don't?

<RYOKO> Ayeka's going to have his head when we get back.
<DAVNER> (Realizing he's been caught) I have no idea what you're talking

TENCHI MUYO IN LIFE
It's a beautiful morning in the Masaki home.  

<RYOKO> It is always a beautiful morning at the Masaki home. It always 
will be too. They will never start the day off with rain, snow, or other 
such weather conditions. We may later on have such things happen, but 
never at the start of the day.
<DAVNER> And that was your daily weather forecast from Ryoko Habuki.
<CAVIS, JINNAI, and AFURA> (applaud)

Tenchi woke up from his bed 
and felt something wrong.  He looked all over his room and found out 
Ryoko 
wasn’t there to wake him up.  

<RYOKO> Now this guy honestly just doesn't know me. Do you realize what 
it would take to stop me from being there to wake up Tenchi?
<CAVIS> An attack by Kagato?
<DAVNER> Your period?
<AFURA> A really bad hangover?
<JINNAI> Makoto Mizuhara?
<RYOKO> Actually... I can't think of anything except if he was in bed 
with me at the time.
<OTHERS> Oh... (dissapointed looks)

Wow he thought Ryoko has finally learned to 
leave me in peace. 

<RYOKO> (nearly in tears) Tenchi you don't hate me that much do you? 
<CAVIS> (puts his arm on Ryoko) There there Ryoko, I'm sure this author 
just has him out of character.
<RYOKO> (glomps Cav) Oh you're such a sweetheart!
<DAVNER> (sighs) He just *so* walked into that one. 

 As Tenchi got out of bed and got dress he opened the 
door and all of a sudden Ryoko jumped onto Tenchi.
“Oh Tenchi I’m so sorry I didn’t wake you up today!”
“Errrrr that’s ok Ryoko.”
“I must woke up to late because I had this wonderful dream about you 
and me 
and we were doing something…special,” Ryoko saying with and flirty 
smile.

<DAVNER>  Hey, Ryoko.  What did you mean by "special?"
<RYOKO>  Making it on the floor like two wolves in heat.
<DAVNER>.........................'kay.
<RYOKO>  (Turns to Cavis.)  We can try it sometime if you like, big boy.
<CAVIS>  (Sweatdrops.)  This is gonna be harder than I thought.

“Errrrrr ummm.” Tenchi said with a big sweat rolling down from his head.
“Get off of Lord Tenchi you sickening monster!” Ayeka cried.
“I see the that Miss. Biotch is awake,” said Ryoko.

<CAVIS>  "Biotch?"  When did this become gangsta rap?
<RYOKO> That would certainly explain the baggy pants in Shin Tenchi.

“Who are you calling a…a bi.. you distasteful devil monster!” said 
Ayeka and 
little wooden blocks surround Ryoko.

<DAVNER AND CAVIS>  LEGOS!!!

“Why don’t you guys just settle it outside?” said Tenchi in a calm voice.
“NO!” Both of the battle ready girls said to Tenchi and a huge explosion 
blew up the side of the house.
“Why me?” said Tenchi

<CAST>  Why not?

NO NEED FOR A COMMANDER
Up in the GP Headquarters deep inside the Headquarters was the Head of 
the 
GP (Mihoshi’s Grandfather) was reading a manga.

<AFURA>  Twenty bucks says it's hentai.  The perv...

  All of a sudden the doors 
flung open and a man in a shiny blue, gold, black and red armor walked 
up to 
the Head of the GP.

<CAVIS>  Jeez!  Now I know what color a hangover is.
<RYOKO>  Add in some pea soup green and some cancerous urine yellow 
and you got it right on the money.
<DAVNER>  (Nods.) Thank you, Crayola!
<JINNAI>  With armor such as that...
<REST OF CAST>  Yeah, yeah.  We know.  You could take over El Hazard.
<JINNAI>  (Laughs annoyingly.)

“Excuse me Commissioner but I finished my mission, Sir! I would like to 
get 
another assignment, Sir!” said the man.

<CAVIS AND DAVNER>  (Salutes.)  YES SIR!  NO SIR!  SPANK ME LIKE A BAD 
PUPPY, SIR!
<AFURA>  Kiss ass...

Shocked, Mihoshi’s grandfather hid the manga from view.

<RYOKO>  (Reads the manga's title)  Girls of Penthouse, Cheerleader 
edition.

“Well, well, well its Commander Lok of the Elite GP.  So you finished 
your 
assignment already, “ said the Commissioner.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Lok.)  Yes, Sir!  The toilets are clean and shiny, 
and your dry cleaning is in your car, Sir!

“Yes sir, I have completed all the objective of my missions, sir!” said 
Commander Lok.

<AFURA> So, what you're saying is that one objective had several 
missions, but several missions only had one objective?
<RYOKO> I'm confused.
<DAVNER> Well, what she's trying to say is that one mission had one 
objective. I mean that two missions had three objectives. I mean... Oh 
the hell with it! What she said!

“I receive many complaints about you from our elite group.  You are not 
letting them have a chance to do anything.  They rot on in their 
quarters 
all day, “ said the Commissioner.

<CAVIS>  Yeah, their hind quarters.

“Sorry sir!  I feel I can do it by myself, Sir!” said Commander Lok.

<DAVNER>  Remember, there's a great big "I" in "TIEM."

“You know what you need a long break from fighting a lot of crime,” 
said the 
Commissioner.  Mihoshi’s grandfather sat there thinking where can 
Commander 
Lok go.  All of a sudden he got a great idea and should send Commander 
Lok 
to the backwash planet, earth.  Since Mihoshi is there they might fall 
in 
love and Commander Lok can take over when he is long gone.

<AFURA>  You know, the Galaxy Police being a monarchy and all...
<RYOKO>  Only in anime could someone come up with a plan this stupid.

“Are you there sir?”  Said Commander Lok.

<JINNAI> (immitating the Marhsall) No I've gone off to my happy place.
<DAVNER> Wow! Jinnai managed to participate in this without bringing 
up taking over El Hazard or Makoto Mizuhara! Way to go Jinnai!

“Yes I’m still here, I have a great idea where you can take your break 
on 
the planet earth.  Where we found you.  Also watch my little Mihoshi 
ok.  
Don’t you think it’s a great idea.”
“Errr yes sir it’s a great idea, Sir!”  Said Commander Lok

<RYOKO> (Imitates Lok.)  Anything for a raise, Sir.

“You can find my granddaughter there on the planet earth, and here is 
a 
picture of her.”
Commander Lok stared in disgust at the picture because he had seen her 
before and knew that she is a walking curse. 

<RYOKO> Ok hold it one minute there buster! This is the OVA universe 
you're dealing with, not the TV universe! Mihoshi actually manaages 
to be very useful to the group a lot of the time believe it or not.
(Whole cast looks at Ryoko in shock.)
<CAVIS> (whispering to Davner) Is it my imagination or did Ryoko just 
stick up for Mihoshi?
<DAVNER> (whispering back) I... I think so. 
<AFURA> (whispering to both) I think the fic's starting to get to her. 

 He also hated blond girls it’s just made him sick.

<DAVNER>  What!?  Who in their right mind hates blondes!?
<JINNAI>  I do.
<DAVNER>  You hate everyone.

“I want you to pack up and leave headquarters for your vacation to the 
planet earth and you can live with Mihoshi if you want to.” With a 
smile on 
the Commissioner face.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates the Marshal.)  Sleep with her, if you like!  I don't 
mind!

“I understand, sir..” said Commander Lok as he exited the office.
“Excellent,” 

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Mr. Burns)  Smithers!  Bring me the head of Negishi!

said Mihoshi’s grandfather thought soon enough they would get 
married and I might be a great grandfather.  He picks up his manga and 
continues to read it.

<DAVNER> (immitates Marshall) Hmm the pages are beginning to stick 
together.
<AFURA> (smacks Davner in the back of the head) Ok we're leaving the 
bounds of tasteful hentai humor here. 

Back to the Masaki house Sasami was cooking in the kitchen and Washu 
came up 
to her and to see what was she doing.
“Hello Sasami,” said Washu.
“Hi there,” said Sasami happy tone.
“Are you cooking up a storm Sasami?”

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Sasami.)  Human flesh...

“No just carrots for Ryo-Ohki.”
“Miya, Miya!” cried Ryo-Ohki.

<RYOKO> The translation of that is "Nice coverup Sasami. They might've 
discovered our secret narcotics business."
<CAVIS> I seriously doubt that. 
<RYOKO> Are you saying you doubt my word?
<DAVNER> (whispers to Afura) I think she's got him right here.
<AFURA> (whispers back) I bet thirty Jurai you're wrong.
<DAVNER> Deal.
<CAVIS> Yep I'm saying that. 
<DAVNER> D'oh!

“Ok Ryo-Ohki it will done soon,” giggled Sasami.

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Sasami)  Into the pot you go, Ryo-Ohki!

Washu sighed and left to see where did everybody go.  She went into the 
living room and saw Mihoshi watching her favorite TV show.  

<AFURA>  Who here wants to bet it was the McLaughlin Group?  (There 
are no takers.)

She also knew 
that Nobyuki was out working on a project and Yosho was probably in the 
shine.  Washu went outside and found Ayeka and Ryoko fighting as 
usual for 
Tenchi’s love.  

<DAVNER>  Mud wrestling?
<CAVIS>  We can only hope.
<RYOKO>  (Turns to Cavis and grins.)  So you like it dirty huh?

She thought to herself that she is very lonely and she knows 
that she couldn’t flirt with Tenchi because Ryoko would be so mad at 
her.  

<RYOKO>  (Begins turning colors>  Is that so, *MOM*!!?? So you have 
your eyes on him too, huh!?  When I get back, you are *so* dead!
<AFURA>  Cut her some slack.  She just said she wasn't going to do 
anything.
<RYOKO>  "Mad" doesn't begin to describe it!

She went to the living room to watch TV with Mihoshi and later Ayeka 
and 
Ryoko joined them.  In the afternoon Tenchi was at the Osen resting 
from the 
hard labor of farming.  All of a sudden he heard a loud boom.  He 
thought to 
himself it might be Ayeka and Ryoko again.

<RYOKO> Ok so far this guy has managed to hit every stereotype of every 
character. Aeka and I are always fighting, Mihoshi is being stereotyped 
as the dumbest creature on the planet, and Sasami has already had a 
cooking scene. Keep this up and you know what you have?
<CAVIS> Shin Tenchi?
<RYOKO> Right!

NO NEED FOR CRUSHES

<CAVIS>  (Looks over and sees Davner beginning to put his arm around 
Afura.  He throws a Butterfinger and hits Davner square in the 
forehead.)  BAD DAVNER!  BAD!
<DAVNER>  Ow!  Damn!  Okay, okay!
<RYOKO>  (Turns to Cavis)  You, know, that's not a bad idea.  Let's 
share some popcorn, ne?
<CAVIS>  Er...

At the crash site where Commander Lok’s aircraft was he started at his 
computer angrily and said
“This ever happened to me before!”
“Oh well it was your fault that you judged it incorrectly Commander.” 
Said 
his computer.  

<CAVIS>  Must be Y2K.
<DAVNER>  (Imitates Lok.)  Goddam Windows 98!

Commander Lok pushed some buttons on his watch and got into 
his armor.  He got out of his ship and started to find where Mihoshi 
lives.  
As he walked though the woods he thought to himself that he was once 
born 
here and later was taken away from earth to train as an Elite GP 
Commander.  
He reached at a house that had strong patterns that Mihoshi was there.

<CAVIS>  Strong patterns?  Like what?  A bright blue neon sign that 
says, "Mihoshi's Place!"?

  He 
knocked on the door.
“Who is it,” said Sasami in a curious voice.
“I’m looking for the owner of this house.” Said the Commander.
“Hold one second please.” 

<CAST>  (Hums elevator musice)

Said Sasami as she raced to find Tenchi.  She 
found Tenchi outside of his room drying his hair.
“Tenchi, there is someone at the door looking for you” said Sasami.
“Ok Sasami,” said Tenchi as he walked to the door and opened it.
Tenchi mouth dropped when he saw a man about a bit taller than him in a 
shiny red, gold, black, and blue armor.
“I’m Commander Lok of the Elite Force of the GP and who are you?”
“I’mmmm Tenchi Masaki.”

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Tenchi.)  Officer, I swear!  It's not even *my* car!

“Hello Kimchi,” said Commander Lok
“No it’s Tenchi.”

<DAVNER>  Yeah.  Kimchi is a clay pot filled with pickled cabbage and 
buried in the soft soil of Korea for storage.  (The rest of the cast 
looks at him strangely.)  I saw it on MASH once...

“Oh ok, Tenchi. Do you mind if I take off my helmet?”
“No problem Commander,” said Tenchi
“Don’t call me Commander call me Henrii, I’m on vacation right now.” 

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Lok)  This is my casual armor.

 As 
Henrii took off his helmet and his dark hair moved like the wind.

<CAVIS>  Hey, Afura.  You're a wind priestess.  Does wind move like that?
<AFURA>  (Laughs out loud.)  Only when it breaks.

  Henrii 
looked inside and saw four girls watching TV and saw Mihoshi.  Henrii 
sighed 
and thought to himself that he all the hard work he had done he came 
here to 
baby-sit Mihoshi

<RYOKO>  Change your name to "Kiyone"...

 and said to Tenchi
“Do you mind if I come in Tenchi?” asked Henrii
“Sure come in,” with a smile on his face.

<JINNAI>  So let me see if I have this straight.  A strange man with 
no references shows up at the front door wearing strange armor, and 
they just *assume* he's harmless?  YES!  This armor must have the 
ability to disguise the true intentions of the wearer and make those 
who look at it incrdibly naive!  (Begins laughing.)
<DAVNER>  (Turns to Jinnai.)  Okay, seriously.  Shut up.  I mean it.
<JINNAI>  (continues to laugh)  THIS WEAPON WILL BE MINE!!!  (Laughs 
some more.)
<DAVNER>  (Quickly reaches out, grabs Jinnai by the head, and slams 
it into the back of Jinnai's chair, rendering him unconscious.  Davner 
turns to the others, who are now facing him.)  What?!  Like *you* 
wouldn't have done the same thing if *you* were sitting here!  (No 
one argues.)

As Henrii enters the living room none of the girls did not know he was 
there 
because their eyes were stuck onto the TV.  And Sasami entered the living 
room to tell everyone that dinner was ready but before she could say that 
dinner is ready she saw Henrii and thought that she had another crush on 
someone.  

<CAVIS>  (Sighs) And here comes the Sasami lemon portion of the fic.
<RYOKO>  WHAT!?  HE'D BETTER NOT EVEN *THINK* OF LAYING A FINGER ON 
SASAMI CHAN!!!!

Henrii turned his head and smiled at Sasami, which made Sasami 
blushed into an apple red.
“Dinner is ready,” said Sasami in a quite voice.
“That’s nice Sasami right after this show,” said Ayeka with her eyes still 
glued to the TV.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Ayeka)  We're watching Baywatch!

“Hello there,” said Henrii
“Umm… what is your name?”  said Sasami in a quite voice with her face 
blushed.
“My name is Commander Henrii Lok of the Elite Force of the GP and what’s 
your name you pretty little girl?” said Henrii in a calm voice.
“My name is is is is oh yeah Sasami and those girls over there is Ayeka the 
purple long hair who is my sister, Washu the greatest scientist in the 
galaxy with the red hair,

<CAST MINUS JINNAI>  IN THE UNIVERSE!!!!

 Ryoko with blue and greenish hair and Mihoshi with 
the blond hair,” said Sasami
“Hi,” said the girls watching TV.
“Who is the greatest scientist here, Sasami,” said Henrii.

<RYOKO>  Weren't you paying attention!?  (Looks over at Cavis and slowly 
moves her hand into his lap.  Cavis jumps.  Ryoko grins at him.)

“That would be Washu the one over there with the red hair.”
“Oh ok she doesn’t seem to be the greatest scientist in the galaxy.”

<AFURA>  Now he's done it.
<DAVNER>  (Leans forward in his seat, rubbing his hands together in 
delight.)  There are few spectacles in life more entertaining than 
watching Little Washu kick the shit out of a man!

Washu heard that and run up right into Henrii and looked up right into 
Henrii face.
“What did you say!” cried out Washu.
“I said that you don’t look like the greatest scientist in the galaxy,” 
replied Henrii.
“Why is that huh, are just hiding your feelings because I’m cute,” replied 
Washu.
“No, because you are a little girl.  I have read many books from the Great 
Washu and seen her pictures and you look too young than what I saw.”

<DAVNER>  (Imitate Lok and holds his hands out in front of him.)  And 
she has knockers out to here....

“Oh yeah well..”  Washu changes into her adult form.

<DAVNER>  HELL YEAH!!!

“Err umm err heee umm hmm ahh?” said Henrii
Washu’s placed her hand on his cheeks and said
“No need to talk gibberish,” said Washu moving closer.
“Oh ok Mrs. Washu,” just after he said that a loud slap echoed in the room.

<AFURA>  He's not very bright, is he?
<REST OF CAST>  (Shakes their heads.)

Washu changes back to her 12-year-old form said to Henrii.
“Never ever call me Mrs. Washu or anything like that just call me Little 
Washu or else!” screamed Washu.
“Ouch that hurt,” Henrii replied. 

<CAVIS>  (Imitates a five year old.)  I have an owie!

Tenchi came up to Henrii and said
“So Henrii why are you here?”
“Well Tenchi I was given orders to watch Mihoshi and stay here.”
“Ok then but we don’t have any more rooms in this house.  Wait I have idea 
you can use the guest futon to sleep on.  You can sleep in my room.”

<AFURA>  Come on lines that never made it...
<RYOKO> (Turns to Afura.)  Hey!  Watch it!

“That’s nice.”
“Why don’t you join us for dinner.’
“Ok,” said Henrii
Everybody sat down at the table.  Tenchi sat between Ayeka and Ryoko as 
usual.  Yosho arrived and sat at the head of the table.  Henrii sat between 
Sasami and Washu and Mihoshi sat at the end of the table.
“So you are our newest guest to our house,” said Yosho.
“Yes my name is Commander Henrii Lok of the Elite Forces of the GP but you 
can call me Henrii, sir”
“I know you I seen you around in headquarters before,” said Mihoshi happily.

<RYOKO>  (Imitates Mihoshi)  You're that guy everyone says is so full of 
himself!

“I have seen you around too and heard many "interesting stories" about your 
missions,” replied Henrii.

<JINNAI>  (Moans and begins to come around.)  Wha....wha...
<DAVNER>  (Leans over and whispers to him.)  Damndest thing I ever saw.  
Makoto Mizuhara just jumped out of nowhere and clocked you!  Said 
something about taking over El Hazard.
<JINNAI>  I KNEW IT!  THAT LITTLE BASTARD!!

“So Henrii why don’t you tell us how you became a Elite Force for the GP,” 
said Yosho
“Ok where do I begin.  Well first I’m 17 years old and single.  

<AFURA>  And desperate...
<CAVIS>  And arrogant...
<DAVNER>  And egotistical...
<RYOKO>  And ugly...
<JINNAI>  And I've got this rash...

I don’t know 
my past exactly but I just remember what they told me when I asked them 
long 
time ago.  Mihoshi’s grandfather needed a group of people that would win 
wars and battles against super villains in the galaxy.  

<CAVIS>  "Super Villains,"  Must be a technical term.
<DAVNER>  (Nods)  Like, "Bad Guy,"  or "Sexual Predator."  (Rest of cast 
looks at him.  Davner looks from side to side.)  What!? Huh?!  What!?

He chose the top 
creature or person to join in the group.   I was told that I was born here 
on earth but I have no idea where.  I was taken away from my family when I 
was about one to start my training. 

<RYOKO> The only training he'd be doing at that age is potty training.
<DAVNER> Didn't Kagato start your training....
(Cavis whaps Davner with the mallet.)
<CAVIS> (whispering to Davner) Are you some sort of idiot?! She's 
senstitive on the "K" subject.
<DAVNER> (whispering back) Why would she be senstitive about K`thardin?
<CAVIS> (shakes head in disgust) Nevermind.

 I became the top student and right now 
I rank 2000 of the best scientist in the galaxy.  I made many of my 
classmates jealous because I better then them.   

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Lok.)  But I don't rub it in.

My first mission when I was 
to arrest Kagto but that failed because he was able to trick me into a trap. 

<RYOKO> Now that's just wrong. Kagato never would've wasted time trapping 
the Galaxy Police. 
<JINNAI> You know Ryoko, with your knowledge of taking on an entire 
empire by yourself you could be a great asset in my plan to take over 
Roshtaria.
<RYOKO> And what exactly makes you think I'd ever work for you?
<JINNAI> Well... um... I could talk this Tenchi guy into actually 
marrying you.
<RYOKO> And you actually believe I'm going to fall for that?
<AFURA> Ryoko dear, you're talking to the guy who's convinced he's the 
rightful ruler of everything he sees and blames Makoto Mizuhara for 
everything from El Nino to country music. 
<JINNAI> Alright you air tramp are you trying to say something about 
me?!
(Afura blasts Jinnai into the wall.)
<DAVNER> Thanks.
<AFURA> Don't mention it. 

  I able to escape but lost some of my teammates.  

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Lok.)  Perhaps I shouldn't have run away with the 
only ship....

After a few years I was 
reached the top and almost near to Mihoshi’s grandfather rank,” said 
Henrii 
in a quick way.

<CAVIS> Oh I'm sure in a universe where people can live to be over ten 
thousand years old it just takes a few years to reach around the rank 
of Marhshall.
<JINNAI> He must've had....
<AFURA> If you finish that thought, you're going to be visiting the wall again.
<JINNAI> *silence*

“I’m 17 too,” said Tenchi.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Tenchi.)  I'm in the school band.

“Hey that’s very interesting,” replied Henrii
“Oh, how is my grandfather doing, Henrii!” asked Mihoshi.

<RYOKO> (immitating Henrii) Well he has this serious gas problem, and 
a lot of people are beginning to say he smells funny.

“Well the last time I saw I’m he was reading a manga but he is doing 
good.”
“So you are an elite force of the GP?” asked Ayeka

<RYOKO>  Isn't *anyone* paying attention!?

“Correct Princess Ayeka,” said Henrii
“I never heard of the Elite Force of the GP and how come I wasn’t informed 
about it.. Wait a second how do you know I’m a Princess!” cried Ayeka
“Well I can read people’s minds if I wanted to and I know that you are a 
princess because you are on this Juri bill,” said Henrii. As he punch some 
buttons on his watch, and his whole armor disappear and Henrii was in his 
white T-shirt and a blue shiny shorts.

<CAVIS>  BICYCLE SHORTS!!  AHHHHH!!  (Cast throws their hands in front 
of their eyes to block out the image.)

  He reached into his pocket and 
pulled out a Juri bill.
“Here you go Tenchi look at Ayeka’s picture on this Juri bill,” said Henrii
Ryoko look over Tenchi’s shoulder and laugh like a mad man.  Ayeka started 
to get upset and started to turn red as lava.
“Ah ha ha ha ha you look like a frog that was been beaten by a stick!” Ryoko 
laughing,
“Why you flat monster you dare laugh at me!” Ayeka with a vein popping out 
of her forehead.

<RYOKO> FLAT?!?!?! (undoes top and sticks out breasts) Ok sister these 
are in the D area alright! You're just barely breaking into the Bs! 
<CAVIS> (faints) 
<DAVNER> Maybe she's refering to Tenchi Forever Ryoko? 
<RYOKO> (shudders) Don't remind me of that. (buttons up top again)
<CAVIS> (gets up off floor) I think I just saw heaven.
<DAVNER> But when Meg finds out, you'll see hell...

“Who are you calling flat you paved road!” replied Ryoko,
“How dare you!” said Ayeka
“There they go again,” everybody said except Henrii.
As another wall was blown off from their battle.  Everybody was on their 
backs except for Yosho who took a slip of tea and got up and left for the 
shine.  Henrii opened his eyes felt something soft on his hand.  He turned 
around and saw that his right hand was on Washu’s chest.  Washu stared at 
him with her green eyes angrily.  

<DAVNER>  Okay, now I'm torn.  On one hand, this guy's a jerk.  On 
the other hand, he just felt up Washu.  Now that's got to be worth 
*some* respect.
<REST OF CAST>  No.

Henrii immediately got up and said
“I’m so sorry Little Washu, so sorry,”
“Would you quit squeezing me,” Washu replied.

<CAST>  PEDO!!

“Oh yes sorry I’m very sorry.  It won’t happen again I promise,” said Henrii 
blushed from that comment.
“Look what you did Ryoko you hurt Tenchi!” cried Ayeka as she ran to aid 
Tenchi.

<RYOKO>  DID NOT!!!

“I wasn’t the person who summoned those little toothpicks,” replied Ryoko.

<RYOKO>  You tell her!!

Henrii got up and helps Sasami and Mihoshi up and said to Sasami
“Your sister Ayeka is in love with Tenchi, right?”
“Yeah did you read her mind or something Henrii?”
“No just the way she acts around Tenchi.”
Tenchi got up and looked around the house the damage that the girls made.
“Just great, another wall the repair,” said Tenchi.
“Are you ok Lord Tenchi?” asked Ayeka.
“I’m fine Ayeka, is Ryoko ok too,” said Tenchi.
“I’m ok Tenchi dear,” as Ryoko pushed away Ayeka, grab Tenchi’s arm and 
smiled at him.
“Hey what do you think you are doing you hard-featured demon,” cried out 
Ayeka.

<AFURA>  "Hard featured?"  A year of practice and that's the best she 
can do?

NO NEED FOR SUPERPOWERS
All of a sudden they disappeared.  Everybody looked around to see what 
happened and saw that Henrii was in full armor and his fingers where 
pointing to the place where Ayeka and Ryoko were.  

<CAVIS>  Oh my God....he atomized them....
<JINNAI>  YES!!  I...
<DAVNER>  (Turns to Jinnai.)  Go ahead.  Finish it.  I *dare* you!
<JINNAI>  Er....nevermind.

Tenchi came up to him and 
said.
“What did do to them Henrii!”  Said Tenchi.  Henrii places his hand down and 
punched some buttons on his watch and his armor was removed from him.
“Well Tenchi, I moved them outside to fight,” replied Henrii.
All of a sudden a big splash was heard and everyone went to see what 
happened.  Sasami opened the door and everybody saw Ayeka and Ryoko in the 
lake.
“How did you do that Henrii?” asked Sasami.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates Sasami.)  I want to atomize people too!

“Well it’s my battle armor it has special powers.  When I’m in my battle 
armor I can fly, teleport or teleport objects, go through walls, and cloak.”
“What is cloak? Henrii,” asked Sasami.
“Well Sasami I can disappear and you won’t able to see me but I will still 
be there.”
“Oh hehehe,” smiled Sasami.
“Hey Henrii you have superpowers?” said Mihoshi.

<RYOKO>  JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, PEOPLE!!!!  PAY ATTENTION!!!!!  (Ryoko 
stands up in annoyed rage.)
<CAVIS AND AFURA>  (Stand up and try to calm her down.)
<AFURA>  Come on Ryoko!  Settle down.
<RYOKO>  PAY ATTENTION, DAMMIT!!!  PAY ATTENTION!!!

“Only four superpower.  One is my ability to make people talk whatever I 
say, I can read people’s minds if I wanted to, move objects, and my 
intelligence,” said Henrii as he turned to Washu and found out that she was 
giving him the cold shoulder.

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Alec Guiness.)  Use the force, Lok... 

“Oh but what’s with teleportation and flying?” Tenchi said.
“That’s my improvement on my battle armor.  I already told this to Sasami. 

<RYOKO>  And if anyone in this fic ever bothered to pay attention to 
anything, we wouldn't have to repeat it EVERY FIFTEEN SECONDS!!! 

That’s why so many of my teammates are jealous of me.” Answered Henrii.
As Ayeka and Ryoko got out of the lake and they stared at each other with 
anger.
“Look what you did Ryoko you got me all wet!” screamed Ayeka.

<RYOKO>  Did not!

“It wasn’t me, honest!”  replied Ryoko.
“You are lying to me you monster!” said Ayeka

<RYOKO>  AM NOT!!  (She glomps Cavis.)  You see?!  You see how mean 
they are to me!?  Oh....hold me!
<CAVIS>  (Begins shaking.)  Please...let...me...go.  

“Just shut up you up tight princess!’ answered Ryoko
“You are so lame!” said Ayeka

<DAVNER>  "Lame?!"  The author ran out of good insults *this fast*?!

“I’m not as lame as you are!” said Ryoko

<AFURA>  Ooooh....Good comeback.
<RYOKO>  (Turns to Afura angrily.)  Shut it!

“Oh yeah!” said Ayeka
“Yeah!” Ryoko.  

<DAVNER>  Yeah?!
<CAVIS>  Yeah!
<DAVNER>  Yeah?!
<CAVIS>  Yeah!

They both grab their wet shoulders and started to wrestle 
and both of them fell into the lake.  Everybody had a big sweat coming from 
their heads.
“Oh dear, they fell in the water again,” said Mihoshi.
“Follow me Henrii I will show you where will you sleep tonight,” said Tenchi

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Tenchi.)  *My* room.  
<CAST MINUS RYOKO>  (Hums porno music.)
<RYOKO>  Hey!  Leave Tenchi alone!  It's not like that at all!
<AFURA>  You *hope so* anyway....
<RYOKO>  No!  It can't be!  Tenchi can't be....gay...
<JINNAI>  Oh, puh-lease!  It's so obvious! 
<RYOKO>  (Blasts Jinnai into the far wall.)

Tenchi and Henrii went back inside and Mihoshi, Washu, and Sasami was 
watching Ayeka and Ryoko wrestling in the lake.
“Oh no,” said Washu as she covered Sasmi’s eyes.

<DAVNER>  Finally!  Some les action!
<RYOKO>  (Blasts Davner into a wall.)

“I think we should get them out before they get cold,” said Mihoshi.
Tenchi and Henrii were in Tenchi’s room.  Tenchi saw him all his CDs, movies 
tapes, and mangas he owned.
“You seem to be a regular teenaged boy on earth,” said Henrii

<CAVIS>  As opposed to the abnormal jerk we all know him to be.

“No not actually because a regular teenaged boy because I’m the heir to Juri 
throne.”

<DAVNER>  (Sits back down in his chair.)  Take that, Elite GP Commander 
boy!

“You sounded sad, why is that.” 

<RYOKO> (Immitating Tenchi) Because I can't get it up enough to sleep 
with Ryoko.
<DAVNER> I'm sorry Ryoko, but that just isn't in character for Tenchi.
<CAVIS> I gotta go with Davner on this one.
<RYOKO> (starts tracing a finger over Cavis's chest) I know you're man 
enough for it though aren't you Cavis?
<DAVNER> (whispering to Afura) I give him about another minute or so 
until he breaks.
<AFURA> (whispering back to Davner) I'd say thirty seconds.

As Henrii was browsing though the mangas

<DAVNER> (immitating Henrii) Now where's that Pikachu and Misty 
hentai comic I put over here.
<JINNAI> With such a comic I could disgust all of Roshtaria into 
submitting to me!
<AFURA> Oh no! I think he's actually found something that might 
allow him to conquer El Hazard this time too!
<JINNAI> (laughs annoyingly)

“I like it here.  I don’t want that many responsibility as the King of 
Juri.”

<RYOKO> (immitates Tenchi with a Tarzan voice.) Me Tenchi! You Ryoko! 
Go bed now!
<AFURA> (imitates Ryoko) Oh Tenchi! Much brave! Ravish Ryoko now!
<DAVNER> (imitates Davner) Me Davner! You Afura! Ravish Davner now!
<AFURA> (blasts Davner into the wall)

“Oh, you seem to have fun like real fun.  Like playing games or talking to 
Ayeka or Ryoko.  Most of my time I spent my 17 years creating something in a 
lab or blowing something up.”

<CAVIS> In many cases both at the same time!

“Henrii you will sleep on the floor tonight ok.”
“Its fine with me.”

<DAVNER> (immitates Tenchi) And you won't get back into the bed with 
me again until you learn to stop snoring!

“I will get the guest futon,” just as Tenchi was to open his door Mihoshi 
and Sasami was holding the guest futon.
“Thank you Mihoshi and Sasami you saved a lot of time for me.”
“Here you go,” both of them said just before Tenchi took the futon and 
closed the door.

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Tenchi.)  He's mine!  You can't have him!

Tenchi unfolded the futon and placed it on the floor.
“Here you go Henrii,” said Tenchi
“Boy I’m tired I’m going to bed early,” yawned Henrii.
“Same here too, boy what a day huh Henrii” said Tenchi.

<AFURA> (as Jerry Springer) And what did we learn today folks?
<RYOKO> That everyone in the Masaki household can't seem to pay 
attention to anything?
<CAVIS> That you should just say no to self insertion?
<JINNAI> That there are many possible methods of conquering El Hazard 
that I haven't considered yet?
<DAVNER> That Jinnai has a completely one track mind?

“Yep,” said Henrii
Henrii jumps into the futon and feel asleep.  Tenchi went to up to his 
wall 
and closed the lights and jumped into his bed and covered himself with his 
blanket.

<AFURA> (immitates Tenchi) Oh man I forgot to clean the sheets after 
last night!
<RYOKO> And we know who gave him those wet dreams. *snickers*
<DAVNER> Aeka?
<RYOKO> (blasts Davner into the wall again)

End of Part I

<CAST>  HOORAY!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My first fanfic.  

<AFURA>  You don't say....

Hope you guys who read it like it, there are more to come. 

<CAVIS> I believe he's already up to chapter ten.
<DAVNER> Oh my god are you saying there is going to be over ten 
chapters of this stuff?
<CAVIS> 'Fraid so. 
<AFURA> I have a sudden new appreciation of Miz and Shayla right now...

Any comments, questions, or corrections please sent an e-mail to 
hlok@hotmail.com 

<CAST>  (Begins writing the address on their palms.)

thank you.


(Cavis, Davner, and Afura are standing together in the main room. 
Davner and Afura are sitting at the table, while Cavis is pacing back 
and forth). 

<DAVNER> So what's the deal here anyways? 
<CAVIS> I have no idea. Washu just called and talked to Ryoko 
privately, then told me to get the rest of us to wait up here.
<AFURA> So where the hell is Jinnai?
<DAVNER> Most likely scouting the place looking for some useful 
thing in his "glorious quest to defeat the evil Makoto Mizuhara 
and conquer all that is rightfully his."
<WASHU> Alright kiddies I'm going to tell you what this is all about 
now.
<CAVIS> Well it's about time.
<WASHU> You see... I installed a little device onto the satelite up 
there as punishment to fan fic authors who create extremely annoying 
characters.
<DAVNER and CAVIS> (gulp)
<WASHU> Don't worry I actually like you two... somewhat. Anyways, 
Ryoko should have our first victim right now. Why don't you head down 
the left corridor and meet her there. 

(The group follows Washu's instructions, and enters a room where 
Ryoko is standing with a man tied up.)

<HENRII> Why you doing this to Henrii?
<RYOKO> Just shut up would ya!
<CAVIS> (looking at Henrii) What the hell is he doing here?
<RYOKO> Why don't you tell us all "mom." What's he doing here.
<WASHU> It's simple little Ryoko. I have devised a hideously evil 
fate for Henrii here and his like. Behold! (Washu presses a key on 
her astral keyboard and a curtain drops in the room on the station 
revealing...)
<RYOKO> (Look of horror in her face) No! That's too cruel!
<CAVIS> (Same look at Ryoko) It... it... can't be.
<DAVNER> (Same... ok just everyone had looks of horror got it people?) 
That's hideous... that's insidious...
<AFURA> It's beyond all descriptions of cruelty...
<WASHU> (Cackles evilly) It is brilliant!
<CAST> It's Haruna's tree!
(A vague soft sound comes from the tree)
Love me... feel bad for me... don't you feel bad for me...
(Cavis and Davner run out of the room screaming)
<RYOKO> (Watches as the two males run for their lives) Well... I 
don't quite blame them. 
<HENRII> Wish me run with guys too.
<AFURA> So Washu, you're planning...
<WASHU> Exactly, Afura! I'm planning for you girls to send our friend 
Henrii here to visit the ol' tree whore for the crime of being 
extremely annoying beyond belief!
<HENRII> I no annoying!
<RYOKO> Would shove it!
<MIHOSHI> Oh hi Henrii! Would you tell me if you have super powers?
<HENRII> Henrii have super powers!
<RYOKO> Oh this isn't starting again. (Ryoko grabs Henrii and throws 
him into the tree.)
<AFURA> So what exactly will she... (Afura looks into the tree) Whew 
it didn't take her long to get started with that one. 
(Ryoko and Afura leave the room as the sounds of Henrii's... agony... 
can be heard coming out of the tree.)


(Cavis and Ryoko are standing in the now lit theatre alone.)

<RYOKO>  What?!  Ain't I pretty enough?
<CAVIS>  No, of course not!  You're my favorite anibabe of all time!  
<RYOKO>  So what is it?!  Huh?!  If I were *really* your favorite, 
you'd kiss me!
<CAVIS>  It's not that simple!
<RYOKO>  (Dejected)  Fine.  How about a hug then, huh?
<CAVIS>  Sure.  (Leans over and hugs Ryoko.  Suddenly, Ryoko grabs 
him and kisses him.  She holds a camera out at arm's length, points 
it at them, and takes a picture.)
<RYOKO>  (Breaks away from Cavis and holds up the camera.)  Well, 
that should do it!  Thanks!
<CAVIS>  YOU TRICKED ME!!
<RYOKO>  (Nods.)  Well, I guess Washu will start sending us back soon.  
I'm sure Afura will appreciate that.
<CAVIS>  (Sighs in defeat.)  Where *is* Afura anyway?  (Blinks)  Oh 
God!  Where's Davner!?

<AFURA>  (Standing with Davner on the command deck.)  Um...Davner...
I'm flattered.  Really, I am, but don't you....
<DAVNER>  Come now, Afura.  Are you telling me you don't feel the 
spark?
<AFURA>  Er....well....
<DAVNER>  I know what it's been like for you.  (Moves closer and 
slowly embraces her.)  Isolated from the others by your genius.  No 
one to talk to, to have an intelligent conversation with.  No one to 
treat you like the beautiful woman you are.
<AFURA>  Um...That is....(Turns red in embarassment.)
<DAVNER>  Every beautiful woman should be kissed at least once....  
(He leans down and kisses her.  Suddenly, Ayeka's face appears on 
the viewscreen.)
<AYEKA>  Oh, Davner!  I'm so proud of you to.......(Sees Davner and 
Afura.)  AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<DAVNER>  (Breaks away from a flustered Afura.)  AYEKA!!  It's...uh..
not what you think!!
<AYEKA>  Oh really?!  You mean to say you weren't just ramming your 
tongue down that wind hussie's throat!!??
<AFURA>  HEY!!
<DAVNER>  Well....okay....*That* part may be what you think....
<AYEKA>  I can't believe you!!  Fine!!  You can stay up there forever 
for all I care!  I hope the two of you are happy up there!!  (Begins 
pressing buttons on her terminal in Washu's lab.)
<DAVNER>  Ayeka.....Sweetie......Darl'n......Buttercup.....What are 
you doing?
<WASHU>  (From off camera)  STOP HER QUICK!!!  (Satellite lurches to 
one side as Washu and Mihoshi grab Ayeka and try to stop her.  Davner 
and Afura fall to the floor.)
<CAVIS>  (Enters the command deck with Ryoko and Jinnai in tow.)  
Davner!  Don't you dare tell me you screwed this up for me!!
<DAVNER>  Cav, I can explain!  (Alarm claxons sound all over the 
satellite.)
<RYOKO>  Save it!  We've got bigger problems!  (Cast cries out as 
the satellite lurches again.)
<CAVIS>  (Grabs Davner by the front of his jacket.)  DON'T JUST STAND 
THERE!  DO SOMETHING!  *REASON* WITH HER!
<DAVNER>  (Calmly removes Cavis' hands from his jacket.)  If this 
was OAV Ayeka, I'd say that reason might work.  But this is *TV* 
Ayeka we're dealing with, and there's no negotiating with TV Ayeka.  
(Satellite lurches again.)

Two hours later...

<WASHU>  Well, the bad news is that the computer is fried.  We 
can't bring any of you back.  
<CAST>  WHAT?!
<WASHU>  But the good news is that we can still send you fics!  
So you won't be bored.  
<CAVIS AND DAVNER>.....yea....
<AFURA>  No, you see, this can't happen!  I have things to do!  
Books to read!
<RYOKO>  (Pushes Afura aside and glares at Washu.)  Hey!  What 
about me!?  I have a date with Tenchi!  You promised remember!?
<WASHU>  Actually Ryoko...you see...I forgot to specify.  Ayeka 
said TV Ryoko could have Tenchi.
<RYOKO>  WHAT?!  But she already gave TV Ryoko *TV Tenchi*!
<WASHU>  Mmm hmmm.  Better luck next time, Ryoko.
<RYOKO>  *MOM*, when I get my hands on you, it's gonna take you 
half the month to die!
<DAVNER>  Smooth, Ryoko.  Give her an incentive to leave us here, 
why don't ya?
<RYOKO>  STUFF IT, DAVNER!!
<CAVIS>  Okay!  That's enough.  Look, we've got one escape pod to 
send one person back.  We have to decide who gets it.
<REST OF CAST>  ME!!
<DAVNER>  (Tugs on Cavis' sleeve and points out the window.)  Is 
that it?
<CAVIS>  (Looks out the window and sees the escape pod hurtling 
towards Earth.)  WHAT?!  Who!?  (Jinnai's face appears on another 
screen.)
<JINNAI>  (Laughs.)  YES!  ONCE AGAIN, LORD GOD JINNAI PREVAILS!  
(Holds up a copy of "Tenchi Muyo in Life.")  I NOW HAVE THE MEANS 
TO CONQUER ALL OF EL HAZARD.  (Laughs.)
<DAVNER>  Um...Cav....are we screwed yet?
<CAVIS>  (Nods.)  I guess we'll just have to stay up here until 
Washu can get us down.
<REST OF CAST>  NO!!
<WASHU>  Good news for you, Davner.  Ayeka says she'll take you 
back if you can keep your hands off Afura until I get you down.
<DAVNER>  (Eyes go wide.)  But that could take months!  
<WASHU>  (Grins)  Hehe.
<DAVNER>  (Breaks down crying.)
<CAVIS>  And so another man is crushed by the Ayeka juggernaut.
<RYOKO>  So now what do we do?
<CAVIS>  I guess we stay  up here.
<CAST>  NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
<WASHU>  Well, here comes your next fic!
<CAST>  (Begins weeping uncontrollably.)  GET US DOWN!!!!!
