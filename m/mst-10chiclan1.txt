  Shadow: No it's not.

  >  The sun beats down upon the Masaki household.

  <All>: <imitating a Hammer pounding on a board>

  >  The alarm goes off in Tenchi's room.  He opens
 >his eyes and tries to focus them.

  Guardian: Damn Hubble contact lenses!

  Rowan: (Tenchi)That's the last time I switch bodies with a
         guy that turns into a duck.

  >  Then he rolls over to find that he's not alone;
  >Ryoko's right next to him and completely naked.

  Bard: YeeHa!!!

  Shadow: So what else is new?

  Rowan: So far it's a normal day in the life of Tenchi Masaki.

  >Ryoko:    Good morning, Tenchi.

  Bard: And there's the pitch!

  >     [SHWING!!]

  <All>: Wayne's World! Party time! Excellent!

  >Tenchi:   Oh no, Ryoko!  Not in the middle of the
  >morning!

  Shadow: You prefer her to come in the middle of the night?

  Bard: With an emphasis on co..*POW*.....<flattened>

 <Rowan shakes his head>

  Rowan: Baka, you just had to go there.

  >Ryoko:    Yes, Tenchi.  I want it... right... >now...

  Guardian: (Tenchi) All right! I'll give you your gems back,
 just let me go back to sleep!

  >     Tenchi curses himself as he grabs Ryoko and
 >slams his mighty Johnson into her.

  Rowan: His mighty what?!

  Bard: And we have Lemon!

  >  Never mind that, as soon as he's in, she's
  >already lost deep in hyperspace, he thought.

  Guardian: Ryoko, Lost in Space!

  Rowan: Can anyone here translate Hentai?

  Bard: In other words Ryoko's reaching for the stars, achieving oneness with
the universe, hitting the ultimate high on the rollarcoaster of life, giving a
new meaning to the words slippery when wet...etc.

  <Others>: Oh! Now we get it.

  > He just wanted to cum into her and get it over
  >with...

  <All>:(Stunned).........WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???!!!

  Bard: YOU MORON!!! PLEASURING THE GIRL IS 99.99% OF THE FUN OF SEX!!!

  Shadow: I hate to say this....but he's right.

  Guardian: I didn't know the Bard knew the Tendo Demon Head Technique.

  Rowan: Neither did I.

  >     [SPLURRRT!!]

  <The reviewers pull out umbrellas and open them up>

  Shadow: Watch where you're aiming that!

  >     Tenchi grabs some clean clothes and leaves his
  >room.  Ryoko's on the bed feeling as stoned

  Shadow: Dope on dope.

 >as Mt.Everest without the snow.

 >-=**=-

  Rowan: Don't shoot till you see the whites of his eyes.

  >     He tries to go into the bathroom.  But the
  >door gets opened by the person from inside.  It's
 >Aeka, the princess of Jurai, wearing only her
 >bathrobe.

  Guardian: This looks suspiciously like the plot of a bad 80's porno movie.

  <Others> And how would you know?

  Guardian: ....uh.....lucky guess?

  Shadow: right.....

  >Aeka: Oh, my apologies.  The other
  >washroom is still in repairs. Your father said it was okay to...

  Rowan: Noboyuki would say that.

  Bard: Can't blame him. I'd do the same thing.

  <Others>: You would.

  >    [SHWING!!]

  <All>: Wayne's World 2!

  >     Too late!  Tenchi pushes her back into the
  >bathroom and flings off her towel.

  Bard: Go Tenchi Go Tenchi Go!

  Shadow <Looks closely> Damn, you win Rowan.

  Guardian: Huh? What was the bet?

  Rowan: Who had a flatter chest, Akane or Ayeka.

  Guardian: And..?

  Rowan: I bet on Akane.

  >He takes her by the thighs and slurps his tongue at
  >her soft petals.

  <The Guardian pinches his nose to stop the bleeding>

  Bard: Mmmmm...Petals....

  Shadow: Sloppy technique. I can do much better.

  Rowan: <Raises an eyebrow> And how would you know about that?

  Shadow: <Smiles> That's for me to know.

  >  This is not exactly what Aeka wanted...  Change
  >that!  This is what Aeka wanted all morning!

  Guardian: Make up your mind.

  >Tenchi stuck his mighty Johnson into the princess's
  >most sacred love canal.

  Shadow: His mighty WHAT??!

  Bard: He shoots, he scores!

  > Her majesty was already gone.  Her "Queen's
  >English" has been reduced to Latin, to Greek, and
  >finally to just prehistoric grunts.

  Rowan: Oh dear, someone's been fiddling with
         Washu's timemachine again.

  >     [SPLURRRT!!]

  <The Umbrellas are raised again>

  Rowan: This is getting messy.

  >     Sigh...  Tenchi took his shower.  Then he puts
  >on his day clothes, being careful not to awaken her
  >royal highness from her royal high, and leaves the
  >bathroom.

  Shadow: So Tenchi's like some kind of drug?

  Guardian: Explains a lot doesn't it.

  >-=**=-

  <All>: What are you looking at?

  >     Tenchi then goes downstairs, and then realizes
  >not to make as much noise.

  Rowan: Too late, Ryoko's awake and wants more!

  >Just then, a pair of mechanical "grab-bots" appear
  >from out of nowhere and try to capture him.

  <All>: And here's Washu!

  >  With squirrel-like speed and agility Tenchi tries
  >his best to ward off the attacks, but they were too
  >powerful for him to handle.  And he was dragged
  >into Washuu's lab producing heavy protest.

  Shadow: (Washu's Lab) Damn it Tenchi go on a diet!

  >    Shackled to a table within a darkened room,
  >Tenchi soon catches a view of his kidnapper:
  >Washuu, sporting the "Ritsuko Akagi (tm)" look.

  Bard: (Washu) Tests, tests and more tests! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

  >Washuu:   I'm here to collect your sperm samples
  >again, Tenchi.

  Shadow: Who saw this coming?

  <All>: <Raise their hands>

  >     [SHWING!!]

  <All>: We're shwinging in the rain...

  >     Tenchi doesn't have a choice at this matter.
  Rowan: When did he ever have choice anyway?

  >Washuu opens her nyloned legs wide to give him a
  >view he'll never forget.

  Bard: I won't either! <Drooling>

  Rowan: At least it's the adult form of Washu.

  Shadow: There's that at least.

  >Then she frees his mighty Johnson from its cage and
  >proceeds to submerse it into her tight pussy.

   Guardian: His Mighty WHAT???!

  <The Bard celebrates>

  >Tenchi's cock doubles in size,

  <All>: .......Kiss the the laws of reality goodbye.

  > and Washuu uses every known trick in the Universal
  >Kama Sutra book to get him off.

  Guardian: The Universal what???

  Bard: You haven't read it yet?

  >  His fuse goes short very quickly, and Washuu
  >feels it as well.

  Shadow: He's hiding a Happodaikarin in there?

  <Others>: DON'T GO THERE!!!

  >She pulls him out, grabs the bucket nearby, and
  >performs fellatio over it.
  >     [SPLURRRT!!  SPLURRT!!]

  <All>: Today's forecast: sudden showers.

  >Washuu:   My-my, Tenchi.  Three cups?  Is that all?

  Shadow: You have got to be kidding me.

 Guardian: No human can produce that much in one go!

 >Tenchi:   I couldn't help it.  Ryoko and Aeka got
 >to me first.

  Rowan:......Okay......it's Tenchi the Overfiend.

  >Washuu:   Oh, damn my luck!

  Guardian: You think your luck's bad, try mine.

  >-=**=-

  Guardian: I've got a lock on his 6, missiles away!

  >     Despite his morning troubles Tenchi manages to
  >have some breakfast and be on his way to the city.

  Shadow: Where he immediately collapses due to severe fluid loss.

  > Along the way he almost passes the Miho-Kiyo
  >residence only to realize that he's suppose to pick
  >up something from them.

  Bard: Yay!

  Guardian: That line is just asking for it.

  >  He knocks on their door...

  Rowan: And is dragged into the house by a sexcrazed Kiyone who proceeds to
screw him and Mihoshi like crazed mindless nymphos.

  >Kiyone:   Who is it?!
  >Tenchi:   It's me, Tenchi!
  >Mihoshi:  Alright!  It's Tenchi!  Come on in!

  Shadow: Damn, that's spooky.

  >     And he does what he says, only to find out
  >that the Miho-Kiyo duo are currently trying out the
  >latest in summer swimwear! (I mean lack thereof!)

  <All>: THANK YOU!!! We're not worthy!!

  <The Guardian passes out due to a severe nosebleed>

  Shadow: <Holding up a sign> "Now I can die happy"

  >     [SHWING ONCE MORE!!]

  <All>: Shwing to the left, Shwing to the right...

  >Mihoshi:  Wow!  Whatta big Johnson you got there!
  >Kiyone:   I guess we should do something about it.

  <All>: Gee..we wonder what'll happen next.

 >     A coin gets tossed.  Mihoshi calls for heads.
 > The coin shows tails and Kiyone ends up giving
 >head.  The jade-haired spacecop gets on her hands
 >and knees and moves her swimsuit aside.

  Shadow: I thought she wasn't wearing one?!

  Guardian: Nitpicking's my job!

  > Then Tenchi immediately does her doggy
  >style.  The spacecop is already sent back to space.

  Bard: Arf arf!

  Rowan: And we have reached orbital insertion.

  >    [SPLURRRT!!]

  Shadow: I ain't cleaning the floor after this!

  >     Then he came to Mihoshi who was already
 >getting herself ready for the ultimate in manhood.

  Bard: It's Tenchi von...

  <The others have their weapons out>

  <Others>: Finish that statement and we'll have to kill you.

  > In no time he starts thrusting into her like a
  >piston.

  Guardian: You forgot the lubricant!

  <Ryo-ohki plays another rimshot>

  >  His actions cause the beautiful scatterbrain...
  >to actually start thinking rationally.

  Bard: Tenchi having sex has suddenly become a miracle?

  Shadow: Think about what you just said.

  Bard: Oops.

  >  After a while Tenchi leaves her gushing pussy and
  >slushes his Johnson between her large, heaving >breast.

  Guardian: You're using a singular instead of a plural!
            Bosom or Breasts, make up your mind!

  >     [SPLURRRT ANOTHER TIME!!]

  <All>: (Bill & Ted) No way!

  >     With the two ravishing ladies tonguing
  >themselves after a hard post-morning's sex, Tenchi
 >leaves their apartment with the thing he neaded: a
 >new tube of Bengay and a bottle of "Painkillahz."
 >(Not just painkillers, PAINKILLAHZ!)

  Rowan: I hope that tube's for the ladies, otherwise
         I'm going to start screaming.

  <Others>: Ditto.

  >-=**=-

  Shadow: Welcome to Walking on Coals 101.

  >     "My language is harsh!  And coarse like the
  >sands of time!  You will be STRUCK!

*SMACK*

Bard: OWWW!!! Why'd you do that for?!

Shadow: He said you'd be struck, who am I to resist fate.

> With a tidal wave of words!"

Guardian: TIDEL WAVE!!!

*<A giant wave of ink crashes down on the reviewers>*

<All>: Glub.....Glub......

> Tenchi's at Tokyo University's
>History 5 class watching a film about the
>Reformation, where Martin Luther and his followers
>take a stand against the spoiling of religion.
> After class Tenchi's about to leave when he
>hears a certain voice...

  Guardian: Let's see who's left that Tenchi hasn't
  done the dirty deed with and is of legal age to do so?

  Shadow: Tsunami.

  Rowan: Nagi.

  Bard: That rival of Kiyone...whatshername.

  >Sakuya:   Afternoon, Ten-chan.

  <All>: <Facefault>

  Rowan: Oh no, don't tell me......

  >     [SHWING!!]

  <All>: Shwingie, Shwingie, everybody loves a shwingie...

  >Tenchi:   [Oh no!  Please, not again!]

  Shadow: Yes, no more gratuitous sex!

  Bard: Go for it!

  >Sakuya:   (Comes over towards him.)  Isn't it
  >amazing!  The past can be so cool
  >once you take the opportu...  (Notices his painful
  >hard-on.)  Tenchi...

  Rowan: And we know what's going to happen next.

  >          Let's go... ^_^;

  Guardian: Yes, let's go away. Far, far away.

  >     Sakuya takes Tenchi to the nearby cheap motel
  >where she removes her panties from under her really
  >short skirt.  She leans on the wall as Tenchi,
  >overdriven with lust, "Johnsonizes" her as well.

  Shadow: Who the hell are you and what have you done with the real
     Tenchi?

  Rowan: You had to wait till now to ask that?

 >Sakuya screams with pain as well as estacy, since
 >she's not used to the immence "banging" like
 >Tenchi's space girlfriends were.

  Rowan: No...more....blatent.....ignorance...of.... lovemaking.....

  Guardian: No...more....horrible...lemon....grammer....

  >  But she loves him SO much that she allows him to
  >do anything he wants to her, knowing that his
  >mighty Johnson can get both of them off.

  Shadow: Mindless....hentai....letting...little head...take over.....

  Bard: Enough with the Shatner impressions!!!

  >     [SPLURRRT!!]

  Rowan: Hey umbrellas aren't cheap to clean you know!!!

  >     An hour of rest and some erotic clean-up
  >later, Tenchi and Sakuya left the motel promising
  >to meet (and screw) again.

  Bard: Sex, sex, and more sex. My kinda fic.

  <Others>: Shut up.

  >-=**=-

  Rowan: Okay I'm out of jokes for this.

  >     Maybe the rest of the day will turn out
  >normal, Tenchi thought.

  Shadow: Tenchi and Normal do not go together in a sentence.

  >  But alas, he will have no such luxury.

  <All>: Of course not, this is Tenchi.

  > A Ryo-Ohki-style spaceship hovers over his head
  >and he's immediately captured by it's tractor beam.

  <All>: Gee, 7 of 9 wants in on the action.

  >     Tenchi's soon shackled (Again?) to a cross in
  >the center of a dark room where infamous bounty
  >hunter Nagi conjures up a way to torture her prey.

  Shadow: Easy, just don't have sex with him.

  Rowan: That's too much to hope for.

  >For some reason she has the heat up too high.  So
  >she decides to remove her black cloak.

  Guardian: Must...not...succumb..to...lousy...cliche.

  >  She ends up revealing to poor Tenchi her
  >ravashingly slender body wearing a see-through
  >fabric nightgown.

  <All>: It's a Bodysuit!

  >     [SHWING!!] (You know, after a while it
  >probably gets a bit tiresome for him to have a
  >hardon for every girl he meets...)

  Guardian: I hear the fourth wall shattering.

  Rowan: I'd think more along the lines of painful & impossible.

  >     Nagi smirks with such pure evil.  She strikes
  >down upon her prey like the hawk she sets herself
  >to be.

  <All>: <Flinch and cross legs>

  > Only this time, it's mating season for this hawk.
  > She shoves his mighty Johnson into her, attempting
  >to conquer this destructive weapon with her own.

  Shadow: That's a woman's ultimate weapon?

  Rowan: The scary thing is that actually makes sense in a sick and twisted
sort of way.

  >She manages to get it all in despite the immence
  >pain caused from such manhood as his.  It's
  >Tenchi's turn to be lost in hyperspace.

  Bard: Tenchi, the Hibiki of Orgasm!

  >     [SPLURRRT...!!]

  Guardian: Splut...splut...out of ammo.

  >     Nagi has succeeded triumphantly as she feels
  >him explode into her.

  Shadow; What do you know, he did have a bomb in there after all!

  *WHAM**CRUSH*BAM*

  <The other three beat Shadow into his seat>

  <Others>: WE TOLD YOU NOT TO GO THERE!!!

  > She allows herself to have an orgasm in front of
  >him, to hear her cum as she drenches his mighty
  >Johnson with her own liquids...

  Rowan: Shoulda worn a raincoat.

  >Mitsuki:  FREEZE!!  You are under arrest!  Come out
  >with your hands out, NOW!!

  Bard: That's not the only thing that's up.

  >     It's Mitsuki in her Galaxy Police ship.  It
  >seems that Nagi has spent too much time in the "No
  >Spaceship Docking Zone."

  Shadow: Interstellar Buracracy strikes again.

  >Nagi:          Damn...!

  Guardian: (Nagi) Curses, foiled again!

  >-=**=-

  Bard: Trash compacter.

  >Mitsuki:  Are you alright?
  >Tenchi:   I'm not sure.  I've been having sex with
  >women all day.

  Rowan: And you can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

  Shadow: Yes, multiple orgasms have a way of doing that to you.

  >Mitsuki:  Tell ya what: Take a little rest.  Lay on
  >my bed for a while. Okay?

  Guardian: Here we go again.

  >Tenchi:   Why, thanks Mitsuki.  (She's not really
  >as mean as Kiyone said she is.)

  Rowan: Wait for it.

  >     While Tenchi slept Mitsuki takes the
  >opportunity to try out those girls' high
  >school clothing she's got from Mihoshi.

  Bard: Now I'm confused.

  Shadow: Join the club.

  > Apparently she's making a bit too much noise.
  >Tenchi wakes up to see what the commotion's all
  >about, just to be greeted by a very sexy-looking
  >Mitsuki, exposing her pink underwear whilst she was
  >putting on her socks.

  <All except the Bard>: (Bored) Boingie.

  >     [SHWING*2!!!]

  <All>: I shwing through the air with the greatest of ease....

  >Mitsuki:  Oh no.  Guess I was too much stimulation
  >for you there, huh?

  Rowan: (Tenchi) What was your first clue?

  >Tenchi:   Mitsuki!  Help me!

  Shadow: Cut it off! Shoot it!! Just kill it before it screws again!!!

  <Others>: AAAggggggHH!!!!! That's disgusting!!!

  Shadow: I know. Ain't it cool?

  >Mitsuki:  Alright, alright.  Here!

  >     Tenchi viciously stabs his might Johnson into
  >the depths of her sex canal. Though the expression
  >on her face doesn't change.

  Rowan: (Ranma) Can it be..? Have I lost my power over women??!

  >Mitsuki:  Well?  Go on.

  Guardian: (Mitsuki) Was that it?

  >Tenchi:   Uh...  Mitsuki.  You're... not...

  Shadow: So you noticed after all.

  >Mitsuki:  Oh I do this all the time!  This is how I
  >rise through the police ranks.

  <All>: Okay.......

  >         And besides, I earn some pocket change
  >that way.  So, screw to your heart's content.

  Rowan: Let's hear it for winner of the biggest turnoff ever uttered in a
  Tenchi lemon.

  >     "Screw" was the word that immediately set him
  >off.  His manhood continuously plunges into her
  >like a raging demon.

  Shadow: Been taking lessons from Akuma have you?

  > Her power universal is so good;
  >it's bringing him to the brink of eruption.

  Bard: Mount Tenchi-ken blows its top!

  >Mitsuki, after years of her pussy being
  >plunged into, only manages to softly moan before...

  Guardian: Demanding payment.

  Shadow: Lighting a cigarette.

  Bard: Spraying enough liquid to end California's drought.

  >     [SPLURRRRTT!!!]

  Rowan: Slippery when wet.

  >Mitsuki:  (Makes a weird face.)  Oh, that's
  >heavenly!  Keep it in!  Just keep it in for a
  >while!  Do you feel it?  Do you feel yourself
  >emptying your nut into me?  (Tenchi nods automatically.)

  Bard: I'm sorry, Tenchi's brain is unavailable at the moment, please call
back when your clothes are on.

  Rowan: Okay, I've had I can stomach for now, all in favor of a break?

  <All>: Aye!!!

  <The four get up and leave, taking care to be
   VERY careful where they step.>
