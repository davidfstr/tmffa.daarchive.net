Disclaimer: Ayeka, Ryoko and Tenchi
are property of AIC and Pioneer whose
stock has risen to millions while I 
huddle for warmth outside paddington
station with my air-conditioned dustbin.
(Harry Secombe rides again!)
The original song, Delilah, is of course
property of that other fog-horn voice
welsh-man, Tom Jones

Well, hello again all I'm glad
your reading this. For those who
have read my modest offerings 
before- PLEASE DON'T WORRY! I'm
going to write a Ryoko song soon!
It just so happens Ayeka's name fits
better with this song. Also, unlike 
the original so no one gets killed 
so any Ayeka haters better get there
ass out soon.
But if you are a fan or a Tenchi agnostic
like me, read on, read on-
Jim

I saw the princess wrap herself outside the onsen
I saw the curve of her breast as she dropped her blind
Ryoko may be gorgeous
But as her towel dropped that thought went out of my mind-

My, my, my
I'm your guy, 
I could feel
That this could never be real
I was slave to the princess whose hair that was purple, 
Not teal 

When she saw I was wachin' her, she thought her modesty left her
I crossed over to help her dry the sweet tears
She knelt there weeping
I felt soft skin against me
And she wept no more

My, my, my Ayeka
I'm your guy, Ayeka
So, in case
Ryoko kicks in my ace
Please deny, my Ayeka,
I touched you in a private place

She was atonished
I felt the warmth in my hands
She waited no more

My, my, my, Ayeka
I'm your guy, Ayeka
So, before
Ryoko calls you a whore
It was my fault, Ayeka
I couldn't resist you much more-
It was my fault, Ayeka,
I couldn't resist you at all!

I wrote that on holiday after listening to the
song on the vcar C.D. player- thus proving I am
a true Tenchi obsessive and need to be taken
into care. Any C&C to Jim 'Diabolo' Moore

Until we read again,
