This song is devoted to all the Mihoshi fans/anti-fans out there.  I just think it fits.  
This is, of course, a spoof of "The Thong Song" by Sisqo.  Enjoy.  I am a big Mihoshi fan, 
by the way, but I can see how she annoys a lot of people.

THE BLONDE SONG

(Violin opening)
(Tenchi speaking)
"This song is about... a certain girl I know. It's to let
people know...hehe...what Kiyone talks about, in private.  
Check it out..."


Oooh that girl is dangerous,
And you know that Kiyone can't handle it.
Walkin' around like she's a ditz,
With a look in her eyes so damn vacant.
Don't be fooled just because she's hot,
A challenge for her is "Connect the Dots",
And she always seems to mess up the plot,
'Cause she's Detective First Class Mihoshi!

(Chorus)
She's as dumb as a truck, truck, truck,
Cries like what, what, what,
Kiyone, kick her butt, butt, butt,
I think I'll sing it again!
She's as dumb as a truck, truck, truck,
Cries like what, what, what,
Kiyone, kick her butt, butt, butt,
All night long, I want to kill that blonde!

I hate it when her voice goes
Duh dun duh dun
I 'd like to make her booty go
Duh dun duh dun
Man I really wanna kill
Duh dun duh dun
That blonde blonde blonde blonde blonde!
I 'd like to make her booty go
Duh dun duh dun
Man I really wanna kill
Duh dun duh dun
Mihoshi!
That blonde blonde blonde blonde blonde!

(Repeat, fade out.)
