Ryoko

Ryoko, my dear, I love you.
Ryoko, my dear, I hate you!
Ryoko, my dear, what are you?

My stomach flutters when you are near
My heart burns when you come
My mind aches when I see you

Tenchi, my sweet, I love you.
Tenchi, my sweet, I hate you!
Tenchi, how could you?

My heart aches when I touch you
My mind burns at that thought
My soul is gone

Ryoko, I lied to you
I hate you
I never loved you

Tenchi, I died when you slapped me
I died when you left me
I died when you kissed her

Ryoko where are you?
I miss you.
Come back to me!

Tenchi is that you?
I miss you
Goodbye love.

I love you Ryoko
My life…

AN:  If you didn’t know, the first two were Tenchi and
then the next two were Ryoko. Then it went back and
forth. If you had some trouble with the organ
implications, e-mail me at,
iamryouko_hakubi@yahoo.com.
The slap was from MnE, the leaving was from TmiL2, and
the kiss was of course from Shin Tenchi.
All C&C, R&R, and whatever go to the e-mail in the
above address. Thanks a bunch!
