Hello I'm Tank Cop.  And I'd like to welcome you to this special fanfic.
Why
is it so special you ask?  Its because I'm not here to do a Sasami Lemon
story!  I'm here to tell you about the stories or ideas that I had that
never
made it.

If any of you writers out there want to take some of these ideas go ahead
and
have them.

There are an assortment of Regulars, Crossovers, Lemon, and many more!

I will explain them in this order: title, type, parts, who's in it, story,
and why it didn't work.

Now sit back relax and as I the great Tank Cop present:

Tenchi Muyo Fanfics That Never Were! Part 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Earth/Jurain War

Type: Crossover

Parts: Six or Seven

Who's in it: Tenchi gang, Ranma 1/2 gang, Salior Moon gang, Devil Hunter
Yohko gang, and Guyver

Story: In this reality the Jurain Empire is a evil planet taking Empire.
When they arrive on Earth they are met with heavy resistance.  Many of
Earths
hero's fight and die in the four year war that will be called The Earth
Jurain War.  In the end the Earth is bombarded from space by the Jurain
Warships.  The Earth surrenders after three day of attack.  Five years later
a rebillion forms from what's left of Earth's hero's.  Later they attack and
final force the Jurains to leave Earth and never return.

Why it didn't work: The story was way to complicated.  I couldn't think of
where to put all these hero's in the story.  I was just to much for me to
put
into a series.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Family Bussiness

Type: Crossover

Parts: One

Who's in it: Tenchi, Ryoko, Aeka, Sasami, Yosho, Devil Hunter Yohko and
family

Story: Yosho's siter in law Mutilda Mono and her family come down to visit.
Yosho and Mutilda know each others secrets.  But the others don't know that
Yohko is a Devil Hunter or that Tenchi is a Half Jurain, or this his friends
are aliens.  They enjoy a day outside when a demon comes to break up there
fun, but its the demon who is the one who's in for it.

Why it didn't work: I just couldn't find the right way to start this story
and it just faded away.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The Hunted

Type: Regular

Parts: One

Who's in it: Tenchi, Ryoko, Jack (New)

Story: After a fight between Tenchi and Ryoko, Ryoko leaves the house and
promise never to come back.  On her way out she is shot with a tranquilizer
dart and taken to a island where her powers don't work!  He knows that she
is
an alien, and gives her a chance to make it off the island if she can make
it
to a ship about five miles away.  If she dosen't make it she dies.  And a
deadly game of cat and mouse begins!  Ryoko later kills the Jack, and makes
it home where Tenchi is worried and waiting for her.

Why didn't it work: I just couldn't see Ryoko running for her life.  She
would rather kill Jack with her bare hands then run.

out three kids and a Pokemon!  They get to the house and ask if they have
seen Ryo-Ohki!  The Sasami asks why they want to see Ryo-Ohki.  They are
tell
them that Ryo-Ohki is Pikachu's wife!  She was She was taken from him many
years ago and left in this world with no memory of her past life.  Ryo-Ohki
is know in there world as a legend.  The most powerful of all Pokemon!

for a little R&R!  But there happy reunion is cut short by Team Rocket who
also finds there way thew the portal.  And kiddnaps Ryo-Ohki in a Pokeball.
They tell them they can have Ryo-Ohki back if they give them Pikachu.
Pikachu agrees.  Before Pikachu is taken into he tells Ryo-Ohki that he will
return to her some day.  Team Rocket takes pikachu and escapes into the
portal.  Ash and the rest say good bye and promise to find Pikachu and bring
him back.  They leave and the portal closes.  Ryo-Ohki will never forget her
lover Pikachu or and the child that he gave her!

Why it didn't work:  Ash, and the rest are to stuiped to know what a portal
is let alone know how to use one.  And if RYo-Ohki is so important Team
Rocket would just let her go.
