Story Title: Ryoko's Feelings
Division: Misc.
Synopsis: A poem-fic that I feel describes Ryoko's feelings when she thought
that Kagato had killed Tenchi.

Actual Fic:

    Cool raindrops roll down my face,
    From a thundercloud only I can see.
    Some may think I am crying, but why would I?
    I have only just lost the one I loved most.
    What reason have I for tears?
