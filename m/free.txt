					    Free?
Another fic from the semi-twisted mind of; Ishtaar, Prince of Malevolent 
Tendencies.
********************************************************************************
*****************
	I'm free. 
	I'm finally free from that horrible blonde anchor in my life. Free from 
all her bumbling, all her ditzy, childish ways.
	She is gone. 
	So why am I not happy?
	Of course I'm happy! 
	She's gone! That stupid ditz is gone!!! I am free to live my life to the 
fullest now, I can go anywhere in life, and I can go straight up to the top! 
I'll be my own boss! Fleets will be at my command! Hundreds will jump at the 
sound of my voice! I am FREE!!!
	Then why?
	Why what?
	Why do I find my self behind a desk for hours at a time?
	Well, I...
	Why am I never going anywhere or doing anything remotely fun or exciting?
	Well, certain sacrifices have to be...
	And, why do I miss her?
	I don't miss her!!!
	Yes you do!
	Well, I...uh...
	Why do I stay up at night hoping. no, PRAYING that she will come over to 
my bed, and asking to sleep with me because she had a bad dream? Why if I am 
free, can I not go anywhere without thinking of her face? Why do I miss her 
innocent little mistakes? Why do I miss the way she would sing with me, or the 
way she laughs at her cartoons? Why do I miss all this? Why do I want her 
back?!?

	Kiyone quickly sits up in a pool of her own sweat, her heat is racing, her 
breaths are short and ragged, and her eyes are red and bloodshot. She holds her 
aching head in her hands and tries to squeeze out any sense in the last few 
minutes. 
	*Sniffle*
	Kiyone's head spins around, on the futon beside her she finds Mihoshi, 
red-eyed and sobbing.
	She wipes her eyes with her sleeve and frowns at Kiyone, "I-I'm sorry 
Kiyone, did *snif* I wake you up?"
	Kiyone smiles softly and shakes her head, "No don't worry, Mihoshi. Did 
you have a bad dream again?"
	Mihoshi sniffles again and nods her head, "Yes, I can't get to sleep."
	Kiyone pulls back her covers, "Do you want to sleep with me?"
	Mihoshi grins broadly, "Yes, *snif* thank you Kiyone."
	Kiyone smiles as her blonde-haired partner hops into bed with her and 
embraces her softly. She whispers, "Any time, Miho-chan."
	Why try to be free, when I'm happy now?
