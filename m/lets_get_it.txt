                                Lets Get It
            Featuring, three the… [Tenchi, Ranma, Lina Inverse]

[Ranma – Almost mumbling]
Reason im a Rottweiler
That I’m from the Rottweiler in Tendo Dojo
to Rottweiler youths.. P-chan

[Tenchi]
Really get smacked silly, Ayeka got smacked silly
F@#*% with the cabbits from the, what you gon’ do
When you ready? Shit I was born ready
Slashed Kagato up like he was fish and spaghetti
Creep with Jurain culture, kendo I can coach ya
Attack like Soja, see what I told ya?
Said I’d get’ cha, wear if it fit ya
Sasami’s thirteen inches, I get the big picture
If Jurai’s to get richer, I’d probably get wit ya
If Ryoko doesn’t burn it, she’ll get hot like a furnace
Shoot Ryu-Ohh, mo@#$&*kin galaxy police permits
We own the Universe im on the phone with Inverse (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when the Masu get aroused
like to assimilate and make trouble in the house; put in the Video
Ya wanna holla got to follow the Komobitou here we go
Get your ticket, the Yagami, don’t miss it
Won’t reach out, and I bet I won’t visit (*Mihoshi cries*)
‘til my whole wardrobe is-it, now listen

[Chorus]
Make this money, take this money (Lets get it)
Ain’t no way you can take this from me (Lets get it)
Ain’t shit funny [uh] shake it honey (Lets get it)
Take it money… now let’s get it (Lets get it)

[Tenchi]
Light Hawk controller, Jurain Ayatollah
Young girls love me when they get older I put cracks by stroller
I’m a registered Masaki voter, mo@#$&*kin a quota
Give me some baking soda, and a Jurai quarter
Bet I flow straight up Tokimi
Mihoshi gonna bring her plate saying she want more Sashimi
Tsunami put the high score up
Then tear the floor up
On the world tour Ayeka callin Sakuya a whore back in Europe
Run to the tour bus
Do what them galaxy policer’s in the drop thinks cooler
Called five reporters to thank Azaka, Kamidake and supporters
Noboyuki hittin wives and daughters
Bought ‘em neck spray from Estee Lauder
Call Lina to order

[Lina]
Aiyyo, call me Inverse – I run this Universe
Send the priests, magicians, and monsters to come and get me
Evil priests wanna leave me for dead you comin with me
Getting fed in the Bentley, red haired at one fifty
Straight lose it, love two things my powers and talking
Never misuse it (*laughs sarcastically*)
Drop mine, hot fireballs exclusive
Got y’all hawkin like gadis’
Cause I can, break backs and stacks it no problem
Make spells and dwell and go Slayers
My enemies get me on worldwide coverage
They got me in so many spots they don’t even bring luggage’s, ya love it
Make magic major, hide out in Asia
If yall keep around im gonna blast ya
Im the bad girl flavor, light black gators
NOT FILTHY, and I’m guilty, c’mon

(Chorus)

[Ranma (Lina)]
I be the eastside dome, Ranma Saotome
Flow in e’ry channel with the Tendo handle
Forty-five amazons turn your day to gray flannel
Snatch Ryoga of the mantle, the proceed to dismantle
Cant slay Ra’
Ho many suckaz done tried to play Ra’, the quit their day job
Tired of putting broke monsters under the wing
If I turn into a girl again I’m goin under the bing
Act like dad gon’ pull that thing thing
He’s the only one that always get stuck for bling bling
I represent, “R” block in Sing Sing
Almost caught a buck of Yeni’ for f@#$% a family’s daughter (Akane, Akane)
Moves for arts, Shampoo no chaser
Bullets out Nabiki’s blazer four-fifth with the taser
Come and get the cold water splitted, newspapers said she did it
(She ain’t do it) Now lets get it (Lets get it)

(Chorus)
Make this money take this money (Lets get it)
Ain’t no way you can take this from me (Let’s get it)
Ain’t shit funny (uh) shake it honey (Let’s get it)
Take it money.. now let’s get it (Let’s get it)

Well that’s it; I don’t know how I got this story in my mind I was watching
Rap City on BET and once I saw the song Let’s Get It I LOVED it, so I just
thought how it’ll be if Tenchi, Ranma, and Lina Inverse made the song, good
thing my computer was on and lots of thanks to Ohhla.com
