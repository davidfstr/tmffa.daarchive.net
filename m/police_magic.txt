		POLICE MAGIC!

Disclaimer/ Notes: 
Though this song contains no real story,
Mihoshi, Kiyone, The Galaxy Police and the 
original japanese version of the song 
'Police Magic!' are all property
of Pioneer, AIC and the orginal lyricist
(Natsuko Kodou) and musician 
(Seikou Nagaoka/Narimitsu ???) .
I make no claims to them, 
If it makes you any happier.
However, this song, sung by Miho and Kiyo
on the kareoke machine never appeared in 
english and I liked the idea of it, so 
I undertook the task of 'translating' it, 
while still making it understandable.
It doesn't actually work to the origianl
music (as far as I'm aware) 
Thanks to Theresa Martin, who wrote the
translation I worked from.
So, here we go:

Kiyone:
Excuse Me, Mr. Crimial,
If you run I can't arrest you,
But If you stay it's really not fair
you see...

Your driving on the wrong side of the road
Your walking on the grass
You shot down a dog, and held up a bank
You've got your hand on that persons....

Oh,
It's tragic!
Oh,
It's tragic!
How could they waste
such police magic?
Report for duty, oh eight hundred
Sitting in my office I wondered
Did I make the right career descision
Would I have been better working at the prision?
But I look down at my badge, it
reminds me that I have that magic!

Mihoshi: 
A written apology? To everyone on this this list?
Oh I'm sorry! Because of our missiles that missed,
The city is full of holes isn't it?
What a terrible twist!
I didn't realise...

That you two were related
You were a Chairman or an MP
You were possessed or simply disordered
And it was just a way of taking a...

Oh!
It's tragic!
Oh!
It's tragic!
Me, with my sparkling
Police Magic
Get off duty, fifteen hundred
I think that I might have blundered
Why is my partner yelling at me down the phone?
Would I have been better just staying home?
But she's so sweet I just couldn't stand it-
We'll use our police magic to track down that bandit!

Both:
Back on track now,
we just gotta say-

Who cares, we made a mistake?
We got good freinds and good luck
I mean, how many criminals can it take
Before me and my partner are totally...stuck?

We'ev been overtaken!
To Boss:Just leave it to us sir!

Oh dear, we lost him... 
To Boss: Just leave it to us sir!

What's a screw doing loose round here?
(No not that kind of screw) I'll just tap it 
and...oh dear...

To Boss: Just leave it to us, sir! 

It seems to have come out right about here, 
But we're on the job 
(No not that kind of job) we'll deal with it soon, 
just wait for a year!

To Boss: Just leave the arresting to the wind, sir! 
We'er tired!


Is it tragic?
No!
It's not tragic-
We got our very own 
police magic
Reporting for duty, madame or sir-
Shall we polish you shoes or just shave all your fur?
Sometimes we wonder if we're in the right place
But every time we look at one anothers face
And ask each other to pick and see
Would we have been anything but Police Trickery?
The answer is-

Both, taking alternate lines:

Is it tragic?
No!
It's not tragic-
We got our very own 
police magic!
Is it tragic?
No!
It's not tragic-
We got our very own 
sparkling, glittering
showering, spittering
glowing, thespian
loving and lesbian
beautiful
bountiful
great
police magic!
You want to see us just whistle whenever you want!
Police magic!
You want to see us just whistle whenever you want!
Police magic!
You want to see us just whistle whenever you want!
(repeat to fade)

Yosho: Wolf whistle
Kiyone slaps him

Well, there we went.
I just hope to god the song wasn't made 
in English, or this will be totally 
defunct. 
Sorry about the homosexual reference,
but my ideas on the Miho-Kiyo 
partnership are very set.
