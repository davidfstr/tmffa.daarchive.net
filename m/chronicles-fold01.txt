Hey!  We own all the characters that aren't Tenchi related!  That includes
Crane, Bear, and Frog as well as the ground they walk on.

Anything else is owned by whoever.

There are stories within the stories.  They are owned by the respective
authors, and the material therein is owned by its creators.

Author's note:
Here's something new.  One of the characters, Crane (me), plays the flute.
I have designed an easy way to know what she's playing.

The Chronicles of The Fold

Part One

Documented by:  The Crane (The_krane@hotmail.com)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Kintaria.  A land of promise.  A land of prosperity.  A lush world
devoid of modern technology.  But of the beauty of the natural planet.
Where animals run free without worry of greedy hunters.  Surviving hunters,
yes.  But, not of hunters who kill for sport.

        Five continents comprise the land.  Most ruled differently by
different people.  One of fire.  One of sand.  One of ice.  One of green
beauty.  One of darkness.

        In the western hemisphere, a large continent takes up most of the
northern half of the western side while only dipping into the southern half
for a few miles at a time.  The green continent, full of life.  Ruled by a
good king.  Stern, but soft.  Fierce, but gentle.  Kind, but nigh
inirritable.

        The second continent, one that takes up the entire northern part of
the world, is covered in ice.  Devoid of people, due to the cold.  But, life
does exist there that has adapted to the extreme bitterness.  Or, so they
say.

        Sand comprises most the third, small continent which lies southeast
of the green continent.  Harsh winds and flying sand repel travelers.
Hence, this land is likewise unpopulated.  However, the southern area of the
continent, strangely, shows signs of green...

        Fire is the element of choice for the fourth landmass.  Larger than
the sand-covered continent, but smaller than the green.  This one lies south
of the green continent.  At the center of this land is a massive volcano
which erupts from time to time.  But, the lava flows do not reach the outer
ring of the continent where several villages lie.  Because of the natural
heat, many weapons are forged here.

        The last of the continent is strangely covered in dark.  A rocky,
barren land with worn lines engrained into the ground.  Thunder crackles on
a minutely basis.  In a mountaintop castle, a single light shines.

        And, above this strange world, a single star shines daylight on the
many lands.  A single, fiery sun which slowly feeds the light-consuming
green plants.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A single wooden building lies in a clearing of trees.  However, the
trees stand close by the house.  Behind the house is a crystal clear lake
which reaches across for about half mile.

        The house itself seems large enough to hold a large family.  Two
wings stretch to each side of the wooden construct.  The entrance itself has
a simple wooden sliding door.

        Outside the wooden walls of this building, soft flute music graces
the air.  __..oo..oO0OoooOO00Oooo...___

        The aforementioned door slides open to reveal a young woman.  About
5 feet tall with short brown hair, she stands with a stern approach.  Her
attire consists of a light pink kimono which reaches to her toes.  The sash
around her waist is red with a small bow tied behind her.  In the center of
her waist, a few clear gems are imbedded with the shape of a heart.

        She walks barefoot gently across the wooden floor.  Without a sound,
she looks to her left into the room of relaxation.  A room with scrolls for
entertainment and a few pillows for comfort.

        In her vision to her right, the kitchen presents itself.  A stone
firepit sits at one end of the room while the other offers an area to sit.
The far wall has a few utensils for cooking such as a large knife, spatula,
and so on.  The seating area itself has only a few cushions sitting on the
floor.

        The young woman passes through another archway into the other half
of the home.  To her right, a closed door leads to a bedroom.  To her left,
a similar room is closed off.  And, ahead of her, another door is closed for
a similar reason.

        She turns and walks to the room to the left and quietly knocks on
the wood of the door.  She stops and waits patiently for a response.

        "Yes?" comes a voice.  A man's voice, but a slightly high voice
which signifies youth is still a dominant factor.  "Who is it?" he
continues.

        "It's Crane," she responds with slight aggitation.

        "Oh!  Come on in!" he requests.

        Crane slides the door open and steps in one pace.  She stops to find
a rather disturbing scene before her.  A shocking scene which drives a cold
chill up her spine.  "What are you doing?" she asks, somewhat angrily.

        A small fire burns in a stone construct.  To one side of the flame
sits two wooden discs and a wooden bar.  Two people, similar in age to the
girl, sit to either side of the short flame.  The boy has black attire and
black hair while the girl has green clothes and black hair.  "Keeping warm,"
he responds to the question.  "Why?  What's wrong?"

        Her anger builds to a point that her face contorts to show it.
"What are you using for fuel?" she asks somewhat calmly.

        "Oh, that?" he asks.  "It's that last scroll you sent to us from
Osprina.  We tried to read it, but got sick after awhile."

        "When the introduced character entered the kitchen," the girl adds,
"we knew we had to dispose of the filth."

        "We found it makes a great source of heat!" the boy adds.  "I mean,
this one burns and burns.  I think we're only on the third segment.  What
was this one called?  'Kanashi no Imi?"

        "Yes," the girl continues.  "After all, 'Heaven and Eternity' just
went WHOOSH!  Pretty worthless, if I say so myself.  This one begs to be
burned."

        "Begged more than 'Warriors of Magic 2?" he asks.

        The young woman plants her fingers on her chin in thought.  After a
few minutes of perplexity, she looks at the boy curiously.  "That, my
friend, is a toss up.  WM2 was pretty revolting."

        "But," Crane grits, "that was your next assignment.  Bear, Frog, you
were supposed to submit a response to it!"

        The pair look at each other with a twinge of fear.  "Bear," the boy
asks, "are we in trouble?"

        "I think so," she responds.  Bear looks fearfully at Crane.  "We're
sorry..." she says in an apologetic tone.  "Please forgive us..."

        Crane sighs in defeat.  "Well, there's nothing I can do now.  It's
already burnt."  Crane reaches behind her and tosses a few scrolls to the
floor.  "I was going to have you respond to these over the course of a week,
but I see you must do them all at once."

        "SEVEN!?" Frog gasps.  "At once?"

        "Were we really that bad?" Bear asks.

        "You burned one of your assignments prematurely," she explains.
"Let this serve as punishment!"

        Frog sighs in defeat and takes up one of the scrolls.  "Well, we
might as well get this over with..."

        "How bad can it be?" Bear asks.

>Pioneer and AIC own these characters.  I'm just using them for a second.

BEAR:  Oh, good!  Our suffering is shortened!
FROG:  For this one, anyway...

>This is just a quick (but funny!) Tenchi Muyo! fanfic.  Its based off the
>OVA, so I don't have Misa in it.

BEAR & FROG:  YAY!

>Brian Burke

FROG:  NOOOO!!!!!  Anything but that!  It's cruel and unsual punishment!!

>Tenchii@hotmail.com

BEAR:  Whatever that means...

>Tenchi Muyo!

BOTH:  Yay.

>The Ultimate Weapon

BEAR:  Roseanne singing?
FROG:  Snorlax gas attack?
BEAR:  Since when are we dragging in your brother?

>==========
FROG:  HEY!  It's Crane's flute!

>       Tenchi is seen working on something, but we can only see his head
>and shoulders.

BEAR:  Don't even think about it, Frog!
FROG:  Well, since you brought it up, you must be thinking it too!

>"Some times the strangest things can happen.

FROG:  I know what you mean.  One day you burn a fic, and the next thing you
know you're tortured by another.

>Three days ago, Kagato returned.

BEAR:  For the 3000th time.

>And, that's when everything went bad."

BOTH:  Figures.

>Three days ago.

>       Tenchi and the others are all working in the fields, planting the
>endless rows of vegetables.

FROG:  I heard that's how 'Kagato's Revenge' started.
BEAR:  Shut up, Frog!

>Suddenly, a green sphere appears in front of them.

FROG:  <Kid>  You get it!  I'm not going into that crazy place!
BEAR:  <Kid>  Wuss!

>       Tenchi, realizing what it is, pulls out Sword Tenchi.  Ryoko, also
>knowing, instantly changes into her battle outfit.  Ayeka puts the rest of
>the group within her force field.

FROG:  Batter up!

>       Kagato, appearing, "I see you're prepared to fight.

FROG:  Or play-
BEAR:  <Hits him hard>  Enough of that joke!

>  That's good for you.  But, I haven't come to fight.  I have come to make
>you all my slaves."

BOTH:  <Sarcastic> Really...  That's original.

>       "Keep dreaming, Kagato!" Ryoko shouts, beam sword in hand.

>       "Oh, but this is not a dream.  I have found the most horrible weapon
>in the universe, right here on Earth."

FROG:  Roseanne singing?
BEAR:  Where is 'Earth,' anyway?

>He motions his hand, and a larger green sphere appears, which spits out a
>large stereo.

BOTH:  <Look at each other>  What's a stereo?

>       "You're kidding, right?" Tenchi asks.

>       "No I am not.  As I said, this is the most horrible thing in the
>universe," he says, slamming down the PLAY button, "COUNTRY MUSIC!"

BEAR:  I'm sure glad I don't have to listen to that!

>       The music starts, and Alan Jackson starts singing.

BOTH:........

>       "NO!" Ayeka yells, her ears covered, "anything but that, ANYTHING!"

>       "Turn it off, PLEASE!" Tenchi yells.

>       "I can't take it anymore!" Ryoko screams.

>       <This is easier than I thought!> Kagato thinks.

BOTH:........
BEAR:  Yes, folks, fear country music.  It'll damage your mind through the
ears.

>==========

FROG:  A staff?

>       The scene changes back to Tenchi working.  "And there you have it.
>That's how it all happened.

FROG:  A cheap trick on Kagato's part.
BEAR:  No kidding!

>Tsunami was then put under Kagato's control, and he went to conquer the
>universe.

BOTH:  Figures.

>After that, the girls were taken as personal slaves, if you know what I
>mean.

FROG:  Lemons, I suppose?
BEAR:  <Hits him>  Don't even think it!
FROG:  Why?  He must have at one point!

>And what am I doing, you ask?"  The scene zooms out to Tenchi in front of a
>mountain of potatoes.

FROG:  That'll keep Sasami busy!
BEAR:  At least it won't turn into a 'Sasami Lemon,' then.

>End!

BEAR:  Or, that could do it, too!

>Just remember:  Those with good creativity also have a good sense of humor!

BOTH:  <Sarcasm>  Ha.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Frog tosses the scroll aside.  The wooden pieces clatter across the
floor before rolling and stopping.  "Well, that was pointless."

        "I agree," Bear adds.  "None of them are ever that much of a wuss."

        "NEXT!" Crane shouts from her seat nearby.  "Keep reading!"

        Bear gasps in horror and grabs a random scroll.  <Cranky little
brat, isn't she?>  "Let's see what this one is..."

>Standard Disclaimer:  I don't own these characters, and I'm not getting

FROG:  Neither are we.
BEAR:  You're not?

>Of course, if laughs were currency, this would make me rich!

BEAR:  We'll see...
FROG:  What?  You get paid, Bear?

>This is just a quickie I thought of during class.  Enjoy!

FROG:  AH!  A schoolboy!

>Tenchi Muyo!:  Carrot

FROG:  <Ryo-Ohki> Miya?

BOTH:  Ryoko?  Where are you?

>"I've been trying to read its mind for hours.

BEAR:  Slow worker...

>This creature can tell us everything about those people."

FROG:  Scanned for hours and didn't learn everything?  What a slacker!

>       "And you're saying you've got the same response from it every time?"

>       "Yes.  I'll run it one more time so you can see."

BEAR:  Run what?

>       The machines

BEAR:  ?

BEAR:  Is this the carrot field or something?

>Mihoshi

BOTH:  Ditz.

>       "Is this normal?  I mean, we should be able to see a lot more than
>that.

FROG:  This is Ryo-Ohki you're talking about.  She only thinks about
carrots.

>We got the best kept secrets from people with this machine."

BEAR:  Well, this 'machine' is scanning something other than a person, you
clod!

>       "That's true, sir.  And, cabbits are supposed to be quite
>intelligent."

BOTH:  Really....

>       "Well, we can't do anything with this one.

BOTH:  Duh...

>Let it go."

        Transporting away, Ryo-Ohki feels she is in a vacuum.

FROG:  What does a vacuum feel like?
BEAR:  I'll answer that if you can tell me the meaning of life.

>Transforming into cruiser form, she takes off for home.

>==========

BEAR:  A road?

>Later

>       Ryo-Ohki lands back at the Masaki home, and is greeted by Washu.
>"So, Ryo-Ohki, you're home."

FROG:  <Sarcasm>  No, really?

>       "Meow!"

>       "They didn't get anything, I suppose?"

BEAR:  From a cabbit?  Are you kidding me?

>       The little cabbit shakes her head, "meow."

>       "Many have tried, all have failed.  My security system really
>works."

FROG:  The universe just lost a few IQ points...

>       "Meow?"

>       Picking her up, "they only got what was on your mind at the time.
>Which, I'm sure, was quite orange in nature."

BEAR:  Is she ever NOT thinking about carrots?
FROG:  No.

>       "Meow!"

>-End-

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Bear sets the scroll aside.  "Well, that's two.  How many do we have
left?"

        Frog looks at the stack a bit fearfully.  "Five."

        "I do have more if you want," Crane threatens.

        Frog's eyes go wide as he realizes she can actually do that.  "You
wouldn't..."  But, seeing as though he's getting nowhere, he takes up the
next piece of work.

BEAR:  Where did Ayeka and Ryoko go?

>Considering how rare they are, the various occupants take full advantage of

FROG:  Lemon?
BEAR:  <Beans him>

>       On such a day, Sasami steps outside with a small paper bag in her
>hand.

FROG:  The fic is that bad already?

>       "Whatcha up to, Sasami?" Ryoko asks from the tree above.

FROG:  Losing her lunch?
BEAR:  That was disgusting and uncalled for.
FROG:  Thank you.

>       "Oh, hi Ryoko!  I was just going to feed the birds."

>       "Feed them what?"

BEAR:  <Looks at Frog closely.>
FROG:  What?

>       Opening the bag, Sasami pulls out a portion of the contents.  "I'm
>just going to put out some bread crumbs."  She then proceeds to sprinkle
>the handful on the ground.  After emptying the bag on the ground, she heads
>back inside the house.

FROG:  Cute AND thoughtful.

>       Moments later, several birds of different species land and eat away
>at the birdy smorgasborg.

FROG:  Is that Crane in there?
CRANE:  <Beans him>  Shut up!

>       Ryoko is watching this from her position in the tree.  "Bread
>crumbs, huh?"  Smiling, she takes off into the distance.

FROG:  Bye bye!

>=-=-=-=-=

BEAR:  Knotted string?

>An hour later.

BEAR:  Gee, it took that long to knot string?

>       Sasami is washing dishes when she looks curiously into the afternoon
>sky.

FROG:  <Sasami>  I'm blind!!
BEAR:  ?

>Although seeing birds fly around is nothing new, watching them do loops
>certainly is.  "What in the world?"

FROG:  Birds do loops.  Figure it out, short-stuff.

>Sasami puts down the dish and walks outside.  Ryo-Ohki follows, curious.

BEAR:  'follows, curious.?'  Okay, this boy need help!

>       As she stands outside, she just watches the birds do tricks in
>mid-air.

FROG:  <Sasami>  I wish I could do that!
BEAR:  ?

>Then, she sees a small object fly from the nearby tree.  Looking to the
>source, "Ryoko?  What are you doing?"

FROG:  Throwing food at the birds!  What do you think she's doing?
Sheesh...

>       "Oh, hi Sasami!  I'm just feeding the birds."

FROG:  Told ya.
BEAR:  Shush!

>       "With what?"

>       Ryoko tosses one of the projectiles down to Sasami.  "I figured
>they'd like these better."

>       Looking at it, "a donut ball?"

FROG:  Yes, a donut ball.

>       Ryo-Ohki's ears perch upwards at the thought.  "Meow!"  She then
>takes to the air after the sweet treats.  "Meow!  Meow!" she says, trying
>to grab at one of them.

BOTH:  Pig.

>       Ayeka walks out of the house.  "What is going on out here?"

>       Ryoko hears her rival and sends a donut ball towards her, but only
>grazes the top of her hair.

BEAR:  Aim lower, Ryoko!

>The bird that followed, however, did not miss.

FROG:  SCORE!!

>Laughing hysterically, "there's no reason to eat crow yet, princess!"

BEAR:  Ba-ad joke.

>       Rubbing her face, Ayeka walks into the house for her own
>projectiles.

BEAR:  Oh, what is she going to throw?  A fit?
FROG:  Now, that was a good one!

>Picking up a few vegetables, she uses her power to shoot them at her enemy.
>  "Take that!"

BEAR:  Yes!  Witness her true power!
FROG:  'Her true power?'
BEAR:  Yes.  The power of PMS!  Unlike most women, it's a constant for her!

>       Ryoko uses her gem power to slow and redirect the carrot portion,
>sending them to Ryo-Ohki.  "Now, let's see what you can really do!"

FROG:  Ryoko could NEVER keep a carrot ahead of Ryo-Ohki.

>       Seeing the carrot fly at her, "MEOW!"  Her eyes glued to the veggie,
>she takes off after it.

BOTH:  That's a given...

>Power diving, she turns up just as she misses Ayeka, sending the princess
>to her rear.

BEAR:  YE-ES!!

>       Walking out, Tenchi sees an interesting sight.  The birds are doing
>stunts in the air, and Ryo-Ohki is chasing a flying carrot.  "What's going
>on out here?"

FROG:  The birds are doing stunts, and Ryo-Ohki is chasing a flying carrot.
What part don't you understand?

>       Ryoko gently tosses down a treat.  "Hello, Tenchi.  I'm just having
>a little fun with the birds."

>       Walking out of the house, Washu has her usual calm look to her.

BOTH:  It figures.

>"It figures."

FROG:  Whoa!  Deja' vu!

>       "That's enough, Ryoko," Sasami says.  "They don't like to be teased
>this long."

FROG:  Cute AND thoughtful!  Just like I said!

>       "Oh, alright."  She lets her donut balls get eaten by the birds, and
>Ryo-Ohki gets her carrot.

BEAR:  It took her THIS long to catch it?

>Finally, she sends out a shower of rolled up sweets into the woods, sending
>the birds away.

>       "It makes sense that you'd do this, Ryoko," Washu states.

FROG:  Sure.  Blame it on Ryoko.

>       Ryoko looks down at them, smiling, "and why is that?" she asks,
>juggling a few more spherical pastries.

>       "Mrm mrm," is heard next to Ryoko.  Looking over, she sees Ryo-Ohki
>eating Ryoko's ammunition.

BOTH:  Pig.

>       "Part cat," Ryoko says, "part rabbit."  Looking closer, "all pig."

BOTH:  Precisely.

>       "Meow..." she whines, dropping her ears.

>       Ryoko takes a donut ball, "well, Ayeka?  Would you like a treat?"

FROG:  <Ayeka>  As a snack, or projectile?
BEAR:  Projectile, I hope.

>       Ryo-Ohki jumps down with one of the bags, knowing what's coming.

>       "Hey!  Give those back!"

FROG:  <Ryo-Ohki>  NO!  My tweats!

>       Ayeka moves into the cabbit's path, taking the bag, "thank you,
>Ryo-Ohki."

>       "Meow?"

FROG:  <Ryo-Ohki>  My tweats...

>       "You wouldn't dare."

BOTH:  You wanna f()&ing bet?

>       Ayeka just smiles as she sends five donut balls at Ryoko, courtesy
>of her Jurai power.   "Have a ball!"

BEAR:  Bad joke...

>       Deflecting the treats, Ryoko takes a few more in her hand.  She then
>launches them at Ayeka, who shields herself.

>       "Food Fight!" Sasami yells.

>       After a few minutes, every donut ball has been impacted, whether on
>the ground, or on someone.

BEAR:  <Terks>  "What kind of primitive beasts are responsible for this
mess?"

>Ayeka seems to have taken the most,

BEAR:  YAY!!

>for she is covered in crumbs.  Ryoko on the other hand, only has a few
>squashed pastries on her body.

FROG:  YAY!!

>       Ryo-Ohki walks up to the sitting Ayeka, and takes a halfway squashed
>ball off her kimono.  Eating it, she just relaxes and meows contently.

FROG:  <Ryo-Ohki>  My tweat!

>       Sasami walks out from behind the tree, crumb free.

BEAR:  Figures.

>"Is the war over?"

>       Tenchi walks out of the house, crumb free as well.  "It seems so."

>       "Well, Ryoko," Washu says, "did you enjoy yourself?"  A second

BEAR:  <Little Miss Piggie>  Yippee skippee!

-Can anyone guess what I'm munching on?

BOTH:  No....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        A loud clattering is again heard throughout the room.  "No more!"
Frog shouts.  In his anguish, he covers his eyes with his hands.  "My eyes
are burning from the bad fiction!!"

        "Worse than the one you burned?" Crane asks irritantly.  She sits
still on a cushion nearby with her arms crossed across her chest.  "If you
don't take responsibility for your actions, you're GONNA get burned!"

        "Let's just keep going," Bear suggests.  Once again, a random scroll
is drawn from the diminshing pile.  This one, however, is slightly thicker
than the rest.  "Oh, well...  Had to read it sooner or later..."

BEAR:  Konoha?  That green haired brat from 'Magical Project S?'

>       "Where did you see her, Hiroto?"

FROG:  Hiroto.  Yep.  The author conveniently crossed over a class.

>       "I was walking home, when I saw her across the street.  She looked
>more like a traditional girl, actually.  She was waiting at the bus stop
>with some bags, and an older woman."

BEAR:  Some bags, or just one?
FROG:  Bear....

>       "What did she look like?"

>       "She was about my age, with long blue hair in a pair of pony-tails,
>and pink eyes.  She was wearing a green kimono with gold and black in it."

BOTH:  Sasami.

>       "And what about the older one?"

>       "She was probably as old as my mom, from the looks of her.  She had
>her hair in spikes, but it was silver colored.  She wasn't dressed as
>traditional, but she seemed to be close to the girl."

BOTH:  Ryoko.
BEAR:  He thinks Ryoko is old enough to be her mom?  Well, it IS true...

>       "I've seen her before!  She and this other lady with purple hair are
>often staggering down the sidewalk.  I think they live in that house out of
>town."

FROG:  You know, as much as those two fight, they seem to be quite good
friends.

        "That one by the lake?"

BOTH:  <Look towards the north wall>  Just a coincidence...

>       "That's probably why the little girl had to use the bus," Hiroto
>says.  "She must live out there, too.  Well, whoever she is, I'd really
>like to know her."

FROG:  Hiroto's in love!!
BEAR:  Konoha won't be happy about that.

>       Konoha looks at him furiously, "oh, no you don't!  You're mine,
>remember?"

BEAR:  See?

>       "No, I don't, Konoha.  I never was, and never will be yours."

FROG:  That's great, kid.  Now, can you keep it up until graduation?

>       The teacher walks in, "alright, kids.  Let's get started."

>       Hiroto sits down, <I really want to know her.>

>=-=-=-=-=

>       Walking home, Hiroto passes the bus stop where he saw the girl
>yesterday.  Looking across the street, he sees nobody around.  "Hmm.  Not
>here today."  Looking down the sidewalk, he sees a familiar form.  "There
>she is!"  Running for the girl, he sees her turn.

FROG:  Of course.  Make it easy for the kid.

>       "Hello!" she says cheerfully.

BEAR:  Of course, have you ever seen Sasami un-cheery?
FROG:  'Sasami and Tsunami,' the baby episode, when she got lost in that
space station-
BEAR:  Alright!  That's enough.
FROG:  Well, you DID ask!

>       "You're the girl I saw yesterday!

FROG:  DUH!

>I hoped to see you again.  I'm Hiroto

FROG:  <Hiroto>  and my hormones are in an uproar."
BEAR:  <Beans him harder than ever!>

>."

>       "Well, after yesterday, I had to see you again."

>       "Why is that?

FROG:  <Sasami>  Because I have the same-
BEAR:  <Flattens him>  That's quite enough of that.

>And, what is your name?"

>       "Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm Sasami.  But, as for your other question, I
>have an interesting story for that."

BOTH:  Uh-oh.

>=-=-=-=-=
>Yesterday

BEAR:  Yesterday, we were calmly minding our own business.
FROG:  Yesterday, we didn't have to do seven reviews in a row.

>       As Sasami is watching the boy walk down the road, she can see his
>eyes are glued on her.  "Who is that, I wonder?"

>       "Looks like you've got an admirer, Sasami," Ryoko says.

>       "What?"

FROG:  YOU HAVE AN ADMIRER!!

>       "I can just see it now.  10 years later, you and him could be
>together."

BEAR:  Nah.  Considering the author, I doubt that could happen.

>       "Ryoko!  Stop!"

>       "You know, if I were your age, I would have probably chased him down
>the street."

FROG:  What do you mean 'probably?'

>       Turning a bit red, "I'm never gonna hear the end of this.  I just
>know it."

BEAR:  Ain't that the truth.

>=-=-=-=-=
>       Arriving at the house, "we're home!"  Sasami shouts.

>       "Hey!  Ayeka!  Have I got some news for you!"

>       <Oh no!> Sasami thinks, shrinking a bit.  <I'm doomed!>

FROG:  That's for sure!

>       "What is it?" Ayeka responds, entering.

>       Putting her hands on Sasami's shoulders, she prevents her escape.
>"It seems someone has a crush on Sasami."

FROG:  <Ryoko>  I think his name's K'thardin!  He was short enough, anyway.

>       "That's not true!" she says, turning shades of red.

BEAR:  Liar!

>       "Sure it is.  I saw the way that boy looked at you.  Maybe you
>should do something for him on Sunday."

>       "What's Sunday?" Ayeka asks.

>       Sasami just grimaces at the thought.

>       "Why, Sunday is Valentine's Day."

FROG:  Oh, that's perfect.

>       Tenchi walks into the room, curious.  "So, who is he?"

BEAR:  Who's 'curious'?  I've never heard of that character.

>       "I don't know," Sasami finally says.

>       "Well, maybe you should find out," he responds.

>       "He was probably walking home," Ryoko adds, "which means he'll be
>walking by again tomorrow."

BEAR:  Logical deduction.  Any others?

>       Sasami turns white, "you're not thinking-"

FROG:  No comment.  I happen to think highly of Ryoko.

>       "Why not?" Ayeka adds.  "If he does like you, he's probably going to
>haunt you for awhile."

BEAR:  Like you and Ryoko haunt Tenchi?

>       "Tomorrow," Ryoko says, "I'll take you into town.  You should meet
>him, Sasami."

BEAR:  And if he's a pervert or something?  Then you can fry him!

>       "Yes, Sasami," Ayeka adds, "it would do you good to find someone
>your own age."

BOTH:  Like Misao?

>       "But-" Sasami stammers, "-I don't know."

>       "Don't worry, Sasami," Ryoko says, "we'll be close by to help you
>out."

>       "That's what I was afraid of."

BEAR:  Yes, they need all the juicy details!

>       "Don't worry about it, Sasami," Tenchi says.  "I'm sure he's a nice
>boy.  Who knows?  Given a few years-"

FROG:  Tenchi?  Thinking ahead?  <Laughs hysterically a full two minutes>

>       "Tenchi!" Sasami shouts.

>       "Oh, come on," he says, "we're just joking.  But, seriously, I think
>you should meet with him.  Maybe he does like you.  And, it would be nice
>for you to make some new friends."

>       Sasami just looks at him oddly.  <This from someone who can't decide
>between two girls in front of him.>

BOTH:  Word.

>       <And if the two do become a couple,> Ayeka thinks, <then that would
>leave Tenchi for me.>

>       <If Sasami and this kid do hit it off,> Ryoko thinks, <then she
>won't get in the way when I want to take Tenchi.>

>       Sasami looks at Ayeka and Ryoko and wonder why they're smiling like
>they are.  <I can only guess...>

FROG:  You don't have to.  What one person constantly inhabits their minds?
BEAR:  Tenchi...
FROG:  So, they usually think about getting from here to him and squashing
any threats along the way.
BEAR:  You make it sound so easy.
FROG:  With those girls?  Are you kiddin'?

>=-=-=-=-=
>       Nervously, "so, that's what happened."

>       "Well, I was hoping to meet you," he says, rubbing the back of his
>head, nervously.  "So, who was that with you yesterday?  Your mom?"

BEAR:  <Ryoko>  Do'h!

>       Laughing a bit, "no, she's not my mom.  She's more like an aunt.
>She lives with us."

>=-=-=-=-=
>       Watching nearby, Ryo-Ohki sees and hears the whole conversation.

BEAR:  Ryo-Ohki, the spy.
FROG:  Agent double-o cabbit.

>       Through the mind-link to the cabbit, Ryoko can also see and hear
>everything.  "He thought I was her mother?  Do I look that old?"

>       Sitting nearby, "yes, you do," Ayeka answers.

>       "I wasn't asking you."

>=-=-=-=-=
>       "Well, Sasami, it's been nice talking to you.  We should get
>together sometime."

FROG:  Please... not another lemon....

>       Turning a little red, "uh, sure.  At least I know where to meet
>you."

>       Pulling out a piece of paper, he scribbles on it.  Giving it to her,
>"here.  This is my phone number.  It's a lot easier than meeting here."
>Running off, "see you later, Sasami!"

>       Ryo-Ohki drops down from her spot, "meow?"

>       "What are you doing here?"

FROG:  <Ryo-Ohki>  Spying on you.  What else?

>       Ryoko teleports in shortly afterward, "that went well, I presume."

>       "Then, you saw-"

>       "-everything.  So, are you going to call him?"

>       Turning red, "I-I don't know.  He seems nice."

>       "Well, I think you should.  You saw how he talked to you.  You don't
>want to break his heart by not calling, do you?"

FROG:  Shouldn't this be in reverse?  Shouldn't she be GIVING the number?
BEAR:  If that's what you think...

>       "Well, no.  But, not right now."  The two then start to walk home.

>       "I understand.  You're still young.  Besides, I'm sure he'll wait
>for you."

>       "Very funny."

>-End?  Not bloody likely!-

FROG:  Considering the age of this one, I say 'bloody likely!'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Frog tosses the scroll aside and falls on his back.  Slowly, he rubs
his hands over his eyelids.  "I can't take any more...  Have mercy,
Crane..."

        "Frog," Crane says quietly, "it takes three days to walk to Osprina
and three days to walk back.  On one such trip, I picked up 'Kanashi no
Imi.'  I didn't know what it was about.  It was just another story, at that
point.  But, you destroyed it before you could give an accurate response.
You made a six day trip USELESS!!  And NOW, you want me to show MERCY?!
Frog, I am showing mercy by not calling DRACO!!"

        "D-Draco?" Bear says nervously.  "You'd call your dragon over this?"

        "Only if you don't keep going!!"

        Bear jumps at the statement and grabs a scroll.  She is about to
open it when she hears wood rolling on wood.  She turns to see Crane picking
up one of the scrolls.

        "That one's a keeper," Frog states.  "It's called 'Ukime.'  It's
short, but really good."

        Crane opens the scroll and begins reading.  "Don't stop on my
account.  You have two more to go.  If you don't, Draco's waiting."

BEAR:  So, what else is new?

>"Mihoshi?" looking into the living room, "Mihoshi, would you go find
>everyone for lunch?"

FROG:  She's more likely to find aliens in the backyard.
BEAR:  ?
FROG:  There ALL aliens.  Get it?
BEAR:  Whatever.

>       Looking up from her magazine, "sure thing, Sasami," she replies.

BEAR:  Two weeks later...

>Seeing that the lab door is the closest to her, she enters carefreely.

FROG:  Of course.  Nevermind the fact that Washu forbids her from entering
the lab.

>Amazingly, she walks effortlessly to the inner areas of the lab.  "Miss
>Washu?" she calls.

BEAR:  <Mihoshi>  I'm here to blow up things again!!

>       The spike-haired red head gasps at the voice.  Like the squeaky
>sound of death, she calls her name.  "MIHOSHI!" she screams.  "How the hell
>did you get in here?"

BEAR:  She, uh, used the door?

        "I, uh, used the door?

BEAR:  See?  Am I good or what?

>Anyways, Sasami has lunch ready."

FROG:  She always seems to have lunch ready.  I bet she'd have lunch ready
at three in the morning!

>       "How did you find me?  I have the place rigged to keep you out!
>Robots, forcefields, and WBFGs!

BEAR:  What's a 'WBFG?'
FROG:  'Washu's Big F---ing Gun.'

>How did you escape them?"

BEAR:  She's Mihoshi.  She can escape anything.

>       "Well, I don't know.  Maybe you should have turned them on?"
>Looking at the current experiment, the bright colors put Mihoshi into awe.

BOTH:  OOooo....  AAaaahhhh....

>"What's this, Miss Washu?" she asks, probing a finger forward.

        "MIHOSHI!  DON'T TOUCH-"

FROG:  Do you know why you should never say that?
BEAR:  Because...  She will?
FROG:  BINGO!!

>But, her tactile impression causes an imbalance in the nucleonic core of
>the luminescent mineral sample.  The result was a sub-nuclear rapid
>expulsion of atoms.

BOTH:  Huh?!

>Readers:  What?

>       Mihoshi touched the rock and blew up the lab.

BOTH:  Oh.

>       After the dust cloud settles, the pair stand frozen.  Charred, but
>frozen.  "Mihoshi," Washu gasps, "I have plans for you."

FROG:  Mihoshi just became a guinea pig...

>       Blinking into conciousness, "what is that?"

>       "I'm going to experiment on you.  I'm going see why you're so damn
>lucky."

BEAR:  Or, so damn st-
FROG:  Now, now.  She's not really that dumb.

>==-==-==
>       An hour later, Mihoshi is strapped to a table in her undergarments,
>with multiple wires attached to her.  Some are attached to her head, some
>to her arms and legs, even a couple to her...nevermind.

FROG:  Oh, come on!  Tell me!
BEAR:  <Beans him>

>       "Mihoshi," Washu asks, "how did you ever become  first class
>detective?  You destroy everything!"

>       "I, uh, try really hard?"

FROG:  Yeah, right...

>       Washu face faults.  "You gotta be kidding me."  Putting her face to
>her guinea pig's, "there must be something you're hiding."

BEAR:  Yeah, about 350 IQ points.

>       Blushing, "no, I don't think so."

>       "Mihoshi, you can tell me.  What did you do?"

>       "Uh, if I tell you," she stammers, "you won't tell anyone else,
>right?"

BEAR:  I just got a very bad feeling about this...

>       Backing off, "sure.  I can keep a secret," she states, crossing her
>arms.  "Tell me.  What did you do?"

>==-==-==
>       Walking into the office in the corridor, the blonde detective sees

>       "Yes, Lt. Kuramitsu," he responds.  "Can I help you?" he asks.

>       "As a matter of fact, yes.  Computer, run the shadow program."

FROG:  As if she'd know about that!!

>The computer complies, and the lights dim.  "Section chief," she says
>quietly, "I'm due for a promotion soon.  I want to show you that I got what

BEAR:  o_O She's not going to...
FROG:  O_o  Curiouser and curiouser...

>       "Uh, how is that?"

>       Walking over to him, she removes her top and drops it on the floor.
>"Let me show you," she responds."

BEAR:  AAAHHH!!!
FROG:  Ye-eah!  Go for it, babe!!

>==-==-==

FROG:  Ah, damn.  I was hoping for some action!

>       "I don't want to hear anymore, Mihoshi," Washu states, ready to be
>sick.  Releasing her victim, "get out of here!"

>       As the woman leaves, Washu explodes into a fit of laughter.  "That
>was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard!  And to think, everyone thought
>it was her skills that promoted her!"

BEAR:  When's lunch again?
FROG:  Hopefully Sasami doesn't have to wait too long...

>==--end--==

        On the wooden floor, Frog is still snickering from the last story.
"That's one way to the top!"

        "Oh, come on!  You don't think that's how Mihoshi got to where she
was?  She can't get through life by screwing her superiors..."

        "No, but it's still funny!"

        "You pig..."

        "There's one left," Crane says in a reminding tone.  "Better get to
it!"

        Frog grabs the scroll, still grinning, and opens it.  "Alright.
Let's get this over with."

>Disclaimer:  Ryoko, Washu and the like are owned by Pioneer.  I'm just out
>to prove a point to my baka friend.

BEAR:  So, there's more people like you?

>=-=-=-=-=
>Tenchi Muyo!:  Proving a Point

FROG:  Is this...

>Brian Burke
>Tenchii@hotmail.com
>=-=-=-=-=

FROG:  I thought so.  I already read this one awhile back.  It's all a
matter of speculation and opinion about Ryoko and her gems.
BEAR:  So, we can't review this one?
FROG:  Reviews are the same way as speculation and opinion.  Reviews in this
case are worthless.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        "Well, that's it," Bear sighs.  "My eyes hurt..."

        "Have you learned your lesson?" Crane asks sternly.

        "Yes, Ms. Crane," they say together.

        "We shall never burn fics again," Frog swears.  He stands and starts
to walk away.  "I need a nap..."

        Overhead, loud thuunder clashes echo through the wooden rafters and
shingles.  Inside the small room, the fire which burns with the still one
bad fic flickers out into smokey dust.

        The three young people glance at the odd occurence and then at each
other.  "What the hell happened?" Crane asks.  Slowly, she walks out the
door.  "Let's see what's going on outside."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Outside, the group gathers in front of the lake.  In front, Crane
stands and scans the skies.  Above, the clouds flash with light and return
to black.  Again they flash, and the cycle continues.

        The winds kick up and start to toss around loose objects.  "What's
going on?" Frog asks.

        Crane doesn't flinch a bit.  Although, her face is extremely
contorted in anger.  "SHOW YOURSELF!!" she shouts.

        <I am N'lan,> a voice booms.  A moment later, a largely built man
appears in ornate clothing.  He lands on one foot on a narrow stump.  When
he appears, the wind and sky calms.  "I have come for you, Crane."

        Frog and Bear look at the young woman in wonder.  "What's going on,
Crane?" Frog asks.

        "N'lan," Crane says quietly, "go away."

        "Crane..." N'lan sings.  "You know it's not that easy."

        Crane pulls a flute from the inside of her sash.  "I am NOT going
back!"  At the statement, Frog and Bear look at each other in confusion.
Crane puts the flute to her lips and prepares to play.

        OOOoOoO0  The tune, although strange and short, gets an immediate
reaction.  Behind N'lan, the lake billows up.  The elevated water washes up
on shore and cleans the sand.  In the center of the lake, at the center of
the disturbance, a giant green giant rises.  It roars as it wades its way
towards the group of people.  A humanoid looking dragon with an extended
neck and long claws.  Large wings unfold from its back, and two horns
stretching back behind its head.

        "Ah, yes," N'lan comments while he glances back.  "Your pet."

        The giant beast slashes its clawed hand at N'lan, but passes through
effortlessly.  It slashes again, but with similar results.  Infuriated, it
roars in anger.

        "Pathetic," N'lan grits.  He raises one hand to the sky.  Not a
moment later, a bolt of lighting thunders down and strikes the dragon.

        "Draco!" Crane shouts.  But, she finds her cry in vain as her
beloved dragon is quickly turned to stone.  The once powerful dragon now
stands like a stone statue in the middle of the lake.  Its agonizing stance
drives a cold spike into her spine.  "Draco..."

        "Crane," N'lan booms, "you know what you have to do.  Don't
disappoint me."  For a moment, the wind picks up as N'lan disappears.

        "Crane," Bear asks, "what's he talking about?"

        She utters no response at first.  Her head droops in depression and
regret.  "I have a trip to take..."
