Tenchi/Tommy Rock Opera
	By Kenneth LeRoy Dicke aka the greenelf, aka Tommy, aka 
Sonytides, aka Rush fanboy, aka Pinkerton H. Hedgrerow, aka 
Weezerboy.  (And no, I didn't make any of them up.)
	E-mail address:  kennethdicke@hotmail.com  I don't care if 
you send me comments or not, but I would appreciate CONSTRUCTIVE 
criticism and would definitely enjoy accolades.  Don't be too 
harsh as this is my first time.  (Be gentle, hoo, hoo.)
	This would be under the Miscellaneous section.

Do you hear or fear or do I smash the mirror.
Plus la change, plus c'est la meme chose.
I think I'm a lot like you!

	This is a songfic which takes the rock opera Tommy, by The 
Who, and transmogrifies it into a whole new story about Tenchi.  
Pretty much sticking to whichever series it was that had kagato as 
the first villain (It was the first they played on the Cartoon 
Network, I think.)  I started at 10pm and finished around 4am so 
this may not be all that great (who am I kidding it probably 
fucking sucks).  I do, however, recommend  the album Tommy, the 
movie Tommy based on said album is also pretty good.  If you don't 
understand the end, neither do I - It's the way Tommy ends.  BTW, 
please don't ridicule for my awful spelling.  I hate using the 
spellcheck thing.  

	Oh, yeah:  This is the almighty disclaimer rendering the 
pitiful masses wanting to harm me ineffectual.  I don't own 
anything Tenchi-ish as that's Pioneer and AIC.  Tommy is probably 
owned by the estates of Roger Daltrey, Keith Moon, Pete Townshend, 
and the great John Entwhistle.  Please don't sue me, as I have no 
money - and don't stand to gain any off of this.




Overture

Prince Yosho
Didn't come home.
His, love Aeka
Will search for him.
Believe him missing
After Ryoko.
Don't expect
Him to ever come home.



He's a Prince! (It's a Boy!)
	
Sasami:	He's a prince, Aeka, he's a prince.
He's a prince, Aeka, he's a prince.
Aeka:	A prince! A prince! A prince!



This Year (1921)

Ryoko:	I've got a feeling that this 
Is going to be a good year.
Especially if me and Tenchi
See it in together.

Aeka:	So you think that this 
	Is going to be a good year.
	It could be for me and he,
	But you and he-no, never!
	I had no reason to be overoptimistic,
	But somehow when he smiles
	I could brave bad weather.

Tenchi:	What about me?
	What about me?
	What about me?
	I know you hardly at all.

Ryoko	You're gonna bear it.
& Aeka:	You're gonna take it.
	You won't look at no other one
	Ever in your life.
	You're gonna choose one.
	You're gonna love one
	Even if you don't approve.
	You're gonna bear it.
	You're gonna take it.
	You're gonna choose one.
	Even if you don't want it.
	You won't look at no other one.
	No other soul is yours
	And that we know is the truth.

Aeka:	I've got a feeling that this 
Is going to be a good year.
Especially if me and Tenchi
See it in together.

Ryoko:	I've got a feeling that this 
Is going to be a good year.
Especially if me and Tenchi
See it in together.

Ryoko	I had no reason to be overoptimistic,
& Aeka:	But somehow when he smiles
	I could brave bad weather.

Tenchi:	What about me?



More Show Up (Amazing Journey)

	Poor little Tenchi 
	He's in a loud female land.
	Grand as it is, to be hit on by chicks
	He's really quite sad.

	Seventeen years old
	With thoughts of tending Shrine Masaki.
	Loving life and all it holds
	Living in simplicity.

	Then it's all destroyed by six women
	Whose minds no men can know.
	More show up to hinder him
	With thoughts of love and hearts aglow.

	Mihoshi's mind a delirium
	Of idiocy.
	All at once a small stranger is looking at me.
	She dresses in a child's lab frock
	Protective covering
	And her red hair flows,
	Nearly covers everything.

	Something to take and something to bear
	And what about me?
	Each day is joy and pain,
	And makes the choice harder for me.

	Then it's all destroyed by six women
	Whose minds no men can know.
	More show up to hinder him
	With thoughts of love and hearts aglow.

	Her eyes are the eyes that
	Transmit all her pain.
	Eyes lost and clouded as if in a game
	Because she is her partner
	Until the very end
	Kiyone will never admit
	That she is her best friend.



	Sparks (Instrumental)



	Kagato Arrives [Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker)]

Kagato:	You talk about your Tenchi,
	Wait until he meets me.
	You talk about your Tenchi,
	Wait until he meets me.
	When we start to our fightin' 
	We'll see if he can defeat me.

	He may have the Jurai power,
	But he will never defeat me.
	He may have the Jurai power,
	But he will never defeat me.
	He can face my beam saber
	Then we'll begin to see.

	He's got the power to beat me,
	Imaginings.
	He's got the power to beat me,
	Imaginings.
	I will kill him again,
	No, it's the Light Hawk Wings.



	Tenchi Gets Home (Christmas)

Yosho:	Did you ever see the faces of the women,
	They get so excited
	Waiting all day long for Tenchi's 
School day arrival as they begin their fightin.'
They believe in love and all above
Especially that he's meant for one of them.
Peeping round the trees
To see which of them greets Tenchi
And wins his heart from him.

And Tenchi doesn't know why they do it.
He doesn't know why they bother him
Or why they can't ignore him.
How can they be saved
From the eternal pain?

Surrounded by his friends
As they fight for him
Trying to avoid a stray power beam.
Playing with the cabbit,
Talks to Sasami and
Avoids Washu and her sampling.
I believe in love
But how can one man ever have
To choose among them.
Only if he's alone
Will his hearts choice ever come to fruition.

And Tenchi doesn't know why they do it.
He doesn't know why they bother him
Or why they can't ignore him.
How can they be saved
From the eternal pain?

Girls:	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Do you love us?
	How can we be saved?

Tenchi:	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!

Girls:	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Tenchi, do you love us?
	Do you?
Do you?
Do you love us?
	How can we be saved?

Yosho:	Did you ever see the faces of the women,
	They get so excited
	Waiting all day long for Tenchi's 
School day arrival as they begin their fightin.'
They believe in love and all above
Especially that he's meant for one of them.
Peeping round the trees
To see which of them greets Tenchi
And wins his heart from him.

And Tenchi doesn't know why they do it.
He doesn't know why they bother him
Or why they can't ignore him.
How can they be saved
From the eternal pain?



	
Ryoko (Cousin Kevin)

Ryoko:	We're on our own, Tenchi,
	All alone, Tenchi.
	Let's think of a game to play
	Now the others have all gone away.
	It won't be much fun
	Until I'm the only one,
	But right now they're all away.
	Do you want to play kiss and tell, my sweet?
	I swear I won't tell, Tenchi my sweet.
	Even if you won't,
	There's problems if you don't.
	I'll seduce you, Tenchi my sweet.

	How would you feel if I
	Took a nice bath,
	And showed up naked
	And started to laugh?
	What would you do if I shut you outside,
	With nothing but me
	And my lovely bare behind?

	I'm the space pirate!
	The romancing cheat.
	The nastiest foe
	Aeka will ever meet.
	I'll make sure you choose me
	And no other, Tenchi my sweet.

	We're on our own, Tenchi,
	All alone, Tenchi.
	Let's think of a game to play
	Now the others have all gone away.
	It won't be much fun
	Until I'm the only one,
	But right now they're all away.
	Do you want to play kiss and tell, my sweet?
	I swear I won't tell, Tenchi my sweet.
	Even if you won't,
	There's problems if you don't.
	I'll seduce you, Tenchi my sweet.

	Maybe a porno left on in the room
	Would change your decision
	And seal your doom.
	I'll drag you along by a lock of your hair
	If you like it rough
	Or maybe you'd like my underwear? 

	I'm the space pirate!
	The romancing cheat.
	The nastiest foe
	Aeka will ever meet.
	I'll make sure you choose me
	And no other, Tenchi my sweet.
	The SM Queen (The Acid Queen)

Aeka:	Tenchi, you ain't all you should be now
	This girl will put you right.
	I'll show you what you could be now
	Just give me one night.

	I'm the Princess - the SM Queen,
	Pay after we start
	I'm the Princess - the SM Queen,
	I'll tear your soul apart.

	In my room, closed the door.
	We'll just be a while.
	Tenchi  won't be a boy no more
	Young, but not a child.

	I'm the Princess - the SM Queen,
	Pay after we start
	The Princess - I'm guaranteed,
	To tear your soul apart.

	Gather your strength and hold on fast.
	Your body must take the pain.
	Just as the SM Queen must do
	You're gonna feel the pain.

	My work is done, now look at him,
	He's never been more afraid.
	His head it shakes, his fingers clutch.
	Watch his body shake.

	I'm the Princess - the SM Queen,
	Pay after we start
	The Princess - I'm guaranteed,
	To break your little heart.

	Tenchi, you ain't all you should be now
	This girl will put you right.
	I'll show you what you could be now
	Just give me one night.

	I'm the Princess - the SM Queen,
	Pay after we start
	The Princess - I'm guaranteed,
	To tear your soul apart.



	Underture (Instrumental)



	Do You Think It's Alright?

Ryoko:	Do you think it's alright?
	To leave the boy with little Washu?
	Do you think it's alright?
	She'll try to steal him from me and you?
Aeka:	Yes, I think it's alright.
Ryoko:	Do you think it's alright?
Aeka:	Yes, I think it's alright.



	Fiddle About

Washu:	I'm the wicked Little Washu.
	I'm glad no one's hear to stop me
	As I fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about.

	Your girlfriends left me here with you.
	Now I'm doing what I want to.
	Fiddling about,
	Fiddling about,
	Fiddle about.

	Down with the zubon,
	Up with your white shirt!
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about.

	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about.

	You can shout as I fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about,
	Fiddle about.

	Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle!
	Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle!
	Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle!
	Fiddle, fiddle, fiddle!





	Heart-Thief Wizard (Pinball Wizard)

Aeka:	Ever since I was a youg girl,
	I've played the little boys.
	In Jurai and all over
	I've always played the toys.
	But I ain't seen nothin' like him
	At any formal ball...
	That Light Hawk Wing kid
	Steals the hearts of all!

	He stands like a statue,
	Ignores all our pleas.
	Feeling our emotions,
	Always playing clean.
	It isn't on purpose,
	The hearts around him fall.
	That Light Hawk Wing kid
	Steals the hearts of all!

	He's a heart-thief wizard.
	There has to be a twist.
	A heart-thief wizard's
	Got a way we can't resist.
	How do you think he does it?
Ryoko:	I don't know!
Aeka:	What makes him so good?

	We cause all those distractions,
	Just ignores our throes of love.
	Don't see Ryoko a-flashin,'
	Prays to the gods above.
	Always without mercy,
	And never lets us go.
	That Light Hawk Wing kid
	Steals the hearts of all!

	I thought I was 
	The lovely little queen
	But I just handed 
	My little heart to him!

	Even when I don't want to
	He can put me to rest.
	All we do is see him,
	And our hearts just do the rest.
	He's got a crazy little haircut,
	May not be that tall...
	That Light Hawk Wing kid
	Steals the hearts of all!!!






	There's a Man (There's a Doctor)

	
Mihoshi: There's a man I've found
	Could bring us all joy!
	There's a man I've found
	Maybe a boy!
	There's a man I've found
	Maybe a boy!

Kiyone:	There's a man I've found
	Could remove my sorrow.
	He lives in Japan,
	Let's see him tomorrow.
	He lives in Japan,
	Let's see him tomorrow.




	It's Time for Dinner (Go to the Mirror)

Sasami:	He seems to be completely unreceptive.
	The love they give him
	Get no response at all.
	His heart reacts to love, Tsunami said it.
	He loves but cannot choose one over all.

Tenchi:	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!

Sasami:	There is no chance, no untried seduction.
	All hope lies with him and not with we.
	Imagine though the shock of hatred
	When he suddenly chooses
	With whom he wants to be.

Tenchi:	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!

Sasami:	His heart can love,
	His choice will come, His nose will bleed.
	All the time the girls will slug and sock.
	None of us can give
	The kind of stimulation
	Needed to remove his choices block.

	It's time for dinner, boy!
	It's time for dinner, boy!

Father: 	I often wonder what he is feeling.
	Does he ever hear a word that is said?
	Look at him when he is dreaming.
	What is happening in his head?

Tenchi:	Listening to you I get the music,
	Gazing at you I get the heat,
	Following you I climb the mountain,
	I get excitement at your feet!

	Right behind you I see the millions,
	On you I see the glory,
	From you I get opinions,
	From you I get the story.

Father: 	What is happening in his head?
	Ooh, I wish I knew, I wish I knew.




	Tenchi Do You Love Us? (Tommy Can You Hear Me?)

Girls:	Tenchi do you love us?
	Can you feel our love for you?
	Tenchi can you feel us?
	How can we hope to win you?
	Ooh, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi.
Tenchi do you love us?
	Can you feel our love for you?
	Tenchi can you feel us?
	How can we hope to win you?
	Ooh, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi.
Tenchi do you love us?
	Can you feel our love for you?
	Tenchi can you feel us?
	How can we hope to win you?
	Ooh, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi.
	Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, Tenchi, 
Tenchi.




	No More Dinner (Smash the Mirror)

Yosho:	You don't answer their call
	With even a nod or a wink
	But you must have a predilection!
	You don't seem to love one
	But I think you know yourself.
	How can their love not affect you?

	Can you hear me?
	Or do I surmise
	That you fear it.
	Can you feel my temper
	Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, 
rise, rise, rise.

	Do you hear or fear or
	Forbid dinner?
	Do you hear or fear or 
	Forbid dinner?
	Sensation

Tenchi:	I overwhelm as I approach you.
	Make your lungs hold breath inside!
	Lovers break caresses for me.
	Love is transplaced when I've gone by.

	You'll feel me coming,
	A new vibration.
	From afar you'll see me.
	I'm a sensation, I'm a sensation!

	They worship me and all I touch,
	Hazy-eyed they catch my glance.
	Pleasant shudders shake their senses,
	My warm momentum
	Throws their stance.

	You'll feel me coming,
	A new vibration.
	From afar you'll see me.
	I'm a sensation, I'm a sensation!

	Soon you'll see me, can't you feel me?
	I'm coming...
	Send your troubles dancing.
	I know the answer.
	I'm coming...
	I'm a sensation.

	I leave a trail of rooted women
	Mesmerized by just the sight.
	The few I've touched now are disciples.
	Love as One, I am the Light...



	The Choice (Miracle Cure)

Yosho:	Hey now! Hey now!
	Hear all about it.
	Heart-thief wizard has made a choice.
	Hey now! Hey now! Hear all about it.
	Hey now!



	Azusa (Sally Simpson)

	Outside the house
	Azusa announced
	That Aeka couldn't stay with the weakling
	He went on chuckling his Royal voice
	And she almost began weeping.
	Tenchi fought the fop
	And she realized she loved him
	As her new King of heart.
	She told her father to go buzz off
	And realized her part.

	She knew from the start
	Deep down in her heart 
	That she and Tenchi were from worlds apart.
	But her heart just said
	"Never mind, your part...
	Is to be what you'll be..."

	The theme of her plan was
	'Come unto me, and love will find a way.'
	So Aeka decided to ignore her dad
	And seek out love anyway!
	She spent many weeks getting ready
	And decided to try to touch him.
	Maybe he'll see that he was for she
	And marry him one day.

	She knew from the start
	Deep down in her heart 
	That she and Tenchi were from worlds apart.
	But her heart just said
	"Never mind, your part...
	Is to be what you'll be..."

	She rivaled Ryoko
	And they started swinging
	To fight it out for Tenchi-sama.
	Day after day she tried for his affection
	And Aeka just kept trying.
	She dreamt at night,
	Looking pretty as a picture
	Right under his very nose.
	And then one fateful day he looked at her
	With a smile
	And said, "I'll always love you!"

	Aeka went crazy
	As Tenchi's words hit her!
	Aeka was lost in love when Ryoko
	Came upon her!

	And soon the temperatures risin'
	As Tenchi's choice revealed.
	Aeka just had to let him know
	She loved him
	And kissed in the front room!
	Ryoko went crazy as she saw this
	And slapped him in the face.
	Tenchi whirled around
	As Ryoko flew away
	But she returned the very next day.

	She knew from the start
	Deep down in her heart 
	That she and Tenchi were from worlds apart.
	But her heart just said
	"Never mind, your part...
	Is to be what you'll be..."

	Her face a teary blur
	And more trickled down,
	Mingling with her fears.
	Tenchi carried her to the landing
	And his voice filled Ryoko's ears.
	She caught his eye, she thought it a lie
	But couldn't stand otherwise.
	Her Tenchi had said,
	"I love you, with all my heart,
	You are the sun, the moon, the skies."

	Ryoko went crazy
	As Aeka hit the roof!
	Aeka was pissed
	For Tenchi had promised
	His self to she, what'd he mean! Ooh!

	Sixteen minutes put her right
	And then she thought,
	"If daddy can do it..."
	Aeka planned a grand Jurai weddin'
	For her new interest.
	Tenchi still talks about the day
	Aeka got pissed!
	Ryoko still carries a hand on her cheek
	To remind her of his kiss.

	Deep down in her heart 
	That she and Tenchi were from worlds apart.
	But her heart just said
	"Never mind, your part...
	Is to be what you'll be..."



	I'm Free

Tenchi:	I'm free - I'm free
	And freedom tastes of reality.
	I'm free - I'm free.
	And I'm waiting for you to marry me.

	You now know what it takes
	To reach your highest high
	You laugh and say,
	"Nothing's that simple."
	But you've been told many times before
	Messages on the door
	And no one had the guts
	To leave their Tenchi!
	I'm free - I'm free
	And freedom tastes of reality.
	I'm free - I'm free.
	And I'm waiting for you to marry me.

Ryoko	How can we marry?
& Aeka:	How can we marry?

	We're Not Gonna Take It

Tenchi:	Welcome to my house
	I guess you all know why we're here
	My name is Tenchi 
	And I made my choice this year.
	If you want to follow me
	You've got to steal their hearts.
	And ignore those who love you,
	Put on a stoic faÿade
	You know where it all starts.
	Hey, you gettin' love
	So sorry, you've got to stop.
	Hey, you coppin' a feely-feel
	That is a not.
	Hey, hung up mister normal
	Don't try to gain my trust
	'Cause you ain't gonna follow me
	Any of those ways
	They'll all just make you bust!

Chorus:	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	Never did and never will.
	We're not gonna take it.
	Gonna break it!
	Gonna shake it!
	Let's forget it better still!

Tenchi:	Now you've got no feelings,
	Your hearts are truly sealed,
	You can't love either.
	Your heart shall soon be filled.
	You can't take no one.
	Now steal all the hearts.
	Here comes Little Washu
	To help you
	To your respective parts.

Chorus:	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.
	We're not gonna take it.

	Never did and never will.
	We're not gonna take you.
	We forsake you!
	Gonna break you!
	Let's forget you...better still!

	We forsake you!
	Gonna break you!
	Let's forget you...better still!

Tenchi:	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!
	See me, feel me, love me, know me!

Zenin:	Listening to you I get the music,
	Gazing at you I get the heat,
	Following you I climb the mountain,
	I get excitement at your feet!

	Right behind you I see the millions,
	On you I see the glory,
	From you I get opinions,
	From you I get the story.

	[Repeat chorus twice more]
