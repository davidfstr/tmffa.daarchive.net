IT'S IN HIS HAIR (SHOOP SHOOP)

Is he like me, I wanna see- 
How can I tell if he's an anime?

Is it when he fought?
Oh no that's just his sword
In his warm face fault?
Oh no, that's when he's bored

If you wanna see
If he's an anime
It in his hair

Is it his eyeslids (eyeleeds)? 
Oh no, that's just he's brows-
In his nosebleeds?
Oh no, he's just aroused

If you wanna see if he's an anime
It's in his hair
Oh oh, it's in his hair

So brush it
And try to style
And find what you wanna know
If he his
It will be there
it's there in his hair!

How 'bout the way glows?
Oh, no thats just his power
And your guesses are more pathetic by the hour-

If you wanna see
If he's an anime
It's in his hair

INSTRUMENTAL

Comb it 
And gel it well
And it will not move at all
If he's one
It will be there
it's there in his hair

How 'bout the way acts?
If he is he won't at all
So please just listen or so far you will fall-

If you wanna see
If he's an anime
It's in his hair

Hmmm...well, it ain't Paul McCartney, 
but what is?...apart, that is, from
Paul McCartney. Contact me and 
let me know ANYTHING,
