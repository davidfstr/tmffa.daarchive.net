Announcer: and today is the video game showdown!
Announcer2: What doe's this have to do with Tenchi?
Announcer: Ask the author.

Announcer2 turns and sees the author sitting next to
him.

Announcer2: So what doe's this have to do with
Tenchi?!
Author: He has a video game called: guardians of
order.
Announcer2: With Ryoko on the front?
Author: Yes.
Announcer2: Oh.

Referee: And here we have... The bad guys!

A bunch of, let me list here, Pigcops, Nod Troops, 1
Kagato, MJ12 troops, rippers, and Xen Creatures walk
onto the arena.

Referee: and here.. the good guys!

Havoc from C&C, JC Denton, Duke Nukem, Lo Wang, Gordan
Freeman, and Tenchi walk out.

Tenchi: Huh? Where are the girls?
Author: Well, we could'nt find any counterparts for
them.
Tenchi: What about Lugis mutants?
Author: They're dead.
Tenchi: Oh yeah.....
Author: and, they don't kill very well.

Tenchi spots the girls in the audience.

Ref: Okay, I want a good, clean fight.... Okay, it
dose'nt have to be good and clean, as long as it
pleases the audince. Got it? Good. Now lets get it on!

JC turned the MJ12 into sushi with the dragons Tooth
Sword, Duke Nukem Blasted the Pigcops into oblivion,
Havoc riddled the Nod full of holes, Gordon
obliterated the Xen, Lo Wang performed chop-saki on
the rippers, and Tenchi began dueling Kagato.

15 Minutes Later....

Duke: This is getting way to long.
Havoc: Yeah!
JC: My vision is augmented.
Havoc: I'll take that as a yes.
Gordon: I agree.
Lo: Yep.

Then Duke, Havoc, JC, Gordon, and Lo Kick Kagatos
butt.

Gordon: That was way to easy.
Havoc: Wheres Duke?
JC: He went to go bribe some girls.
Lo: thats his problem. How come hes always doing that?
Tenchi:Because a bunch of college kids got to make:
Duke Nukem 3D.
Lo: Hmmmm... I wish my game was made by the same
peopole....

All the good guys wandered out, and managed to get
away from the girls, went back to there areas, and
continued to kick bad guy butt.
THE END

Duke: Hey! Don't end without telling me where the
nearest strip club is!
