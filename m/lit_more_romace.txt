A little more romance in the Masaki house?

    ( At a coffee shop in town near the Masaki residents)

Stephen- AH shit.
Tenchi- Becareful.
Stephen- The coffee’s hot.
Tenchi- That’s how they serve coffee.
Stephen- I ordered iced cappuccino.
Tenchi- Maybe they got the order mixed up.
Stephen- Oh well.
Tenchi- It’s getting late, we should be heading home.
* Chair screeching *
Stephen- I guess your right. Hey thanks for letting me stay with you.
Tenchi- Don’t worry about it. So how long are you gonna stay in Japan?
* Wind blowing in the trees *
Stephen- Don’t know. Whenever the orphanage decides to move me. Could be
tomorrow, could be next year.
Tenchi- If you don’t mind me asking how did you become an orphan?
* Stephen stops dead in his tracks *
Tenchi- Oh sorry didn’t mean to offend you.
Stephen- No that’s all right. I can’t keep it secret forever. I can’t
exactly remember but I was told by several police officers and doctors that
an airplane lost control and crashed in the passenger terminal. Hundreds of
people died my parents were among them dead I miraculously survived.
Sorry I can’t talk about it anymore.
* sniff *
Tenchi- Sorry to hear it.
Stephen- That’s all right. Hey isn’t that your house?
Tenchi- Yeah. I wonder if Sasami started dinner.
* Door slides open *
Tenchi- Come on in I’ll introduce you.
* Door slides shut *
Ryoko- Hi Tenchi.
Tenchi- Hi Ryoko.
Ryoko- Huh? Who’s that?
Tenchi- Oh, that’s Stephen. He’s gonna be staying with us.
Ryoko- Hey Stephen my name is Ryoko.
Ayeka- Hello Lord Tenchi. Oh and whom might you be.
Stephen- My name is Stephen.
* Extends hand to shake *
Ayeka- My name is Ayeka, Princess and heir to the throne of Jurai.
* Extends hand to shake with Stephen *
Tenchi’s Father- Tenchi, oh this must be Stephen. How do you do.
Stephen- Hello and thank you for letting me stay with you.
Tenchi’s Father- No problem. Sorry we don’t have any extra rooms due to
all
the guest we have, so you can share a room with Tenchi if you don’t mind.
Stephen- No that will be fine.
Tenchi’s father- Show Stephen to your room and help him get settled.
Tenchi- All right, come on Stephen.
Stephen- K
Tenchi- You’ll be sleeping over there. * Pointing to a corner *
And you can hang your clothes on this side of the closet.
* Closet door opens *
Stephen- Thanks.
Sasami- Dinner Time. Hey Tenchi dinner time. Oh, a friend.
Tenchi- Yeah this is Stephen.
Sasami- Hi Stephen. I’m Sasami.
Stephen- Hi.
Sasami- Well you two hurry up and get down there.
Tenchi- Hey Sasami are Mihoshi and Kiyone home yet.
Sasami- Yeah they just got home.
* Running down the stairs *
Mihoshi- Hi Tenchi. Who’s that?
Tenchi- Well this is Stephen. Stephen she is Mihoshi and to the right of her
is Kiyone.
Stephen- Hi.
Sasami- * With a worried tone * Were one space short.
Stephen- That’s okay IM not that hungry. I’ll be in my room.
Tenchi- Aren’t you the least bit hungry.
Stephen- Not really.
Ryoko- Tenchi let him go.
(Later that Night)
* Tiptoeing down the stairs *
* Door opens then closes *
Stephen- Boy it sure is a beautiful night. Tenchi’s so lucky. He always
has
two girls fighting over him and that Sasami girl probably likes him but she
is a little young, but Mihoshi... WOW! What a beauty, kind of klutzy though.
You know IM talking to myself again.
* Door opens and closes *
Tenchi- Hey what are you doing out here?
Stephen- Huh? Oh hey Tenchi, nothing much couldn’t sleep.
Tenchi- I heard what you were saying.
Stephen- * With a concerned look* Which part?
Tenchi- All of it but don’t worry I won’t tell Mihoshi.
Stephen- Thanks.
Tenchi- I’m not that lucky.
Stephen- What do you mean? I would love to be in your situation.
Tenchi- No you wouldn’t. I’m constantly having to explain to the other
that
there is nothing between whoever. Sometimes it pisses me off.
Washu- You know I couldn’t help but overhear your little situations.
Stephen- I don't believe I’ve met you. My name is...
Washu- I know who you are but my name is Washu. Now about your situation I
could have you two switch bodies.
Tenchi- How?
Washu- I thought you would never ask. Well I could take Stephen’s mind and
put it in your body Tenchi and vice-versa. So therefore you could see life
through each others eyes.
* A sudden hush *
Stephen- Sounds interesting.
* Tenchi with a concerned tone in his voice *
Tenchi- How long will its effect last?
Washu- However long you want it to.
Stephen- Well Tenchi how a ‘bout it?
Tenchi- Sure, but only for one day.
Stephen- Okay.
Tenchi- Washu do it.
Washu- Great step into my lab.
* Door opens and closes *
Washu- All right, Stephen lay down there Tenchi lay down there. * Pointing
to
two steel tables * * Straps weird helmets on them * Now stay still for just
a
sec.
*BZZT* All done.
S/Tenchi- Hey it worked.
T/Stephen- Yeah.
(The next day)
T/Stephen - * Yawn * * Shocked * Hey Stephen wake up.
S/Tenchi- Huh? It’s  6 ‘o clock in the damn morning!
T/Stephen- I have your body!?!
S/Tenchi- Yeah we switched bodies last night remember?
T/Stephen- Oh yeah.
Sasami- Tenchi you and Stephen are eating first so there is more room.
S/Tenchi- Thanks Sasami.
(After breakfast)
T/Stephen- IM gonna go take a shower.
S/Tenchi- All right. Oh Sasami do you need any help?
Sasami- No that’s all right Tenchi.
S/Tenchi- Okay.
Ryoko- Morning Tenchi.
S/Tenchi- Good morning Ryoko.
Ayeka- Good morning Lord Tenchi. Oh what a terrible thing to see first thing
in the morning.
Ryoko- You're not any better princess.
Ayeka- Take that back.
Ryoko- Make me. * Grinning *
S/Tenchi- Please it’s to early in the morning to be fighting oh never
mind.
Sasami- Tenchi, could you wake up Kiyone and Mihoshi.
S/Tenchi- Me?!
Sasami- Yeah IM a little busy.
S/Tenchi- All right.
* Knock Knock *
S/Tenchi- Ugh Kiyone, Mihoshi time to wake up.
(After a couple more attempts)
* Door slides open *
S/Tenchi- * In a whisper * Hey time to wake up.
* Mihoshi turns over to show her in her pink silk nightgown *
* Stephen’s face turns bright red *
S/Tenchi- * In a whisper * I should get outta here.
(Right before Stephen or Tenchi as we should say walks out of the room)
Mihoshi- Hey Tenchi what are you doing in my room?
S/Tenchi- Sasami sent me in here to wake up you and Kiyone.
* Mihoshi jumps up outta bed to show the nightgown is incredibly short,
again
S/Techi’s face turns bright red *
Mihoshi- Thanks Tenchi.
S/Tenchi- * Walking out the room * No problem Mihoshi. [Oh my god it’s
like a
dream come true] * Smiling *
T/Stephen- What’s with the smile?
S/Tenchi- Tell ya later.
(A day full of dreams come true but another day comes to an end but does
Tenchi and Stephen want to switch back? Let’s find out.)
Washu- You two have fun.
T/Stephen- This was like a tiny vacation. No bothersome Ryoko and Ayeka.
S/Tenchi- I don’t think their trouble, I actually feel loved.
S/Tenchi- I know it sounds corny but I never had the advantage to have
loving
parents or people around.
T/Stephen- I see.
Washu- So you want to stay this way.
T/Stephen- I don’t know.
(A small noise comes from the house)
S/Tenchi- Shh you hear that? Someone’s listening in.
T/Stephen- How can you tell?
Washu- I hear the person too.
T/Stephen- Huh?
* S/Tenchi walking to the door *
Mihoshi- [Oh no he’s coming] * Running half way up the stairs *
S/Tenchi- Mihoshi what are you doing up this late at night?
Mihoshi- Ugh... getting something to drink.
S/Tenchi- * huff * How long have you been listening?
Mihoshi- I heard it all.
(At this point T/Stephen and Washu come in)
S/Tenchi- * A heavy tone in Stephen’s voice * * Huff * Tenchi let’s
switch
back.
T/Stephen- Are you sure?
S/Tenchi- Yeah.
Washu- Okay let’s do it.
Mihoshi- Can I watch?
Washu- Sure.
*BZZT*
Washu- All done.
Stephen- I feel allot better. How a ‘bout you Tenchi?
Tenchi- Nothing like your own body.
Mihoshi- Stephen can I talk to you alone?
Stephen- Ugh, sure let’s talk outside.
Mihoshi- Stephen was that you that saw me in my nightgown.
Stephen- Yes.
Mihoshi- Did Sasami really ask you to wake Kiyone and me up?
Stephen- Yes, I was trying to play my part as Tenchi. He's not the type to
just go in your room for no reason.
Mihoshi- But you would.
Stephen- No let me finish. I would do something like that if I was gonna
whisper in your ear and say I love you or something.
Mihoshi- Do you?
Stephen- Do I what?
Mihoshi- Love me. Do you love me?
Stephen- I don’t know what love is. I just said that as an example, I’ve
never known real love of any kind.
Mihoshi- So you don’t * Tears Up * love me? * Starts crying *
(Mihoshi wakes up all the people in the Masaki residents)
(Right now everybody is peering out the door as Mihoshi is standing there
crying and Stephen feeling a little embarrassed)
Stephen- Mihoshi please stop crying.
Mihoshi- * Stops crying * Okay * sniff * I’ll try * sniff *
Stephen- Mihoshi listen I really like you and I wish we could be together...
Mihoshi- But?
Stephen- I never know when the orphanage is gonna transfer me.
Mihoshi- Aren’t you old enough to do what you want?
Stephen- Not yet in another year I will be, but I don’t know were I’ll
be
then.
Mihoshi- Stephen.
Stephen- I may not know how long I have, but I want to spend the rest of
that
time with you.

The End
