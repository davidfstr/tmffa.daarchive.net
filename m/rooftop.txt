Thoughts on a Rooftop
By Jon Farber (sabreb@erols.com)


Don't you understand?  The only reason I can do all this, the only 
reason I can go on is because I know that you are here for me... here to 
hold me and tell me it's all right...  I know you call me your 
bodyguard, or a worrier, but that's all I can do about you.  You are 
like a god to me, my rock and my redeemer.  Whenever something goes 
wrong, I know that you are there to help make it right.  Whenever I 
don't know what to do, I look to you and it's like nothing else matters. 
 You own me completely and totally, and I love you more with more 
passion each and every day.  Why can't you see that when you look at me? 
 Why can't I tell you?

No... Please don't put your arm around me, please don't pull me in.  
Tasting heaven like that would be sheer hell for me.  I can't stand to 
see you smile at me, knowing that you smile that way for them, too.  You 
can't understand how much I want to just hold you, nothing more, and 
feel your warm body relax, to wake up in the morning and watch you 
breathe while you sleep.

I have no choice.  I snuggle in closer to you, resting my head on your 
chest, listening to your heart beat slowly, soothing me, lulling me to 
sleep.  This is happiness, and I would trade everything that I have, 
everything that I am, to be able to stay like this forever with you.

"C'mon, Ryoko.  Let's go inside now." you mumble, ever so gently 
squeezing my shoulder.

Snaking my arm around you, I plead, "Mmmm.... In a few minutes, Tenchi."

No author's notes, no nothing...  Just a kind of melancholy fuzzy 
feeling...
