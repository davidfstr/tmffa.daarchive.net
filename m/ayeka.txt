excellent Shaggy and Rayvon. (They own
the original lyrics, by the way)
So sit back in your computer chair,
set warp to maxium, flib your mib

		"AYEKA"

Yosho: Yo dis is Yosho, Nobiyuki and Tenchi wit de combination
Tecnhi: So skilled wit dees things
Yosho: Yeah!
Nobiyuki: Yo, flip dem light hawk wings
All: hawk, hawk, hawk...

Girl, your my Ayeka your my darlin' Ayeka
My princess, you are to me, baby
You're my Ayeka, your my darlin' Ayeka
Meet beneath the Jurian tree, lady

Life is one big carnival at Tenchi's house
But in de end der's one girl who's gonna be his spouse
Not Ryo-Ohki, cos she is just a mouse
It's Ayeka who can arouse,
Forget all them other cows
Looking back Ryoko always a flyin'
I love both o' you, sure I ani't lyin'
But I wanna be a Jurian show my laughin' and my cryin' 

Your my Ayeka your my darlin' Ayeka
Closer than the rest you are to me, baby
Girl your my Ayeka, your my darlin' Ayeka
When chips are down, it's you I need, lady

You’re a queen and so you should be treated 
Though I took you for granted when you pleaded
But now my affections have been seeded 
A plant of love and I intend to feed it
Nobiyuki said that I should love and marry someone 
So that we could have time in this emotion 
But the feelings that I have for you are so strong 
I think your the only one to lie with me out in the sun

Girl, your my Ayeka your my darlin' Ayeka
My princess, you are to me, baby
You're my Ayeka, your my darlin' Ayeka
Meet beneath the Jurian tree, lady

Uh, uh 
Girl, in spite of waiting, said I wanna be your king
(You came in a ship from up above) 
And with love I will pay you, say girl I obey you
(You gave me all your love) 

Girl, please forgive my behavior,you have been my savior 
(Your like the godess of love) 
And you appear to be flyin', girl I'll be your Jurian
(You remind me of a dove) 

Life is one big carnival at Tenchi's house
But in de end der's one girl who's gonna be his spouse
Not Ryo-Ohki, cos she is just a mouse
It's Ayeka who can arouse,
Forget all them other cows
Looking back Ryoko always mention 
I love both o' you, sure I ani't lyin'
But I wanna be a Jurian show my love and my cryin' 

Your my Ayeka your my darlin' Ayeka
Closer than the rest you are to me, baby
Girl your my Ayeka, your my darlin' Ayeka
When chips are down, it's you I need, lady

Girl, your my Ayeka your my darlin' Ayeka
My princess, you are to me, baby
You're my Ayeka, your my darlin' Ayeka
Meet beneath the Jurian tree, lady

Well then, maties- how did you enjoy that?
Not at all? 
Well, don't worry.
I might even sing it and put
it on napster, so watch out for that.
