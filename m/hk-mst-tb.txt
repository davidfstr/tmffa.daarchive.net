Author's Notes:

This story, in case you didn't read the rating, is a romance with a rather
graphic sex scene
using two of the characters from the TV series, Tenchi Muyo!. If you are
looking for a
Tenchi/Sasami sex fic, I'm sorry, but I just don't do that kind of thing.

<Keone>Anybody who is sane doesn't do that kind of thing.

Never have, don't andnever will. However, Nagi does present some interesting
possibilities. There is a lot of
graphic content and is not suitable for all ages. Since there are so few
good Tenchi
romance/Hentai fics out there, I figured that I would incrase their numbers
by one.

<Washu>::Laughing hysterically.:: When I forsee the future, (laugh) I see
nothing but lame, boring sex.

Who knows? Maybe I'll write more. As always, comments, questions and
requests are welcome.
If you want to flame me, please don't. While I may not have much experience
in the field of
romance/sex no matter which way you look at it, I do know what I have
observed in many a
Tenchi episode, and I can really see the love between these two. Before I go
any further,
this is NOT a Yaoi fic. If that's what you were looking for, you won't get
any of that out of
me.

<Washu>I forsee the future and can see that the author is into yuri.

I apologize if you were looking for one, but I have morals to stick to. And,
for what it's
worth, Sakuya is in this one because I wanted her to be. This still follows
the storyline of
the series Tenchi Universe, in which Ryo-Ohki is Ryoko's pet, Ryoko is
Washu's daughter and
Sasami never merged with Tsunami. That happened in Tenchi Muyo!, not Tenchi
Universe.

*******************************************************************************************************************

It's a typical day at the Masaki house. Ryoko and Ayeka are in the midst of
one of their
many fights over Tenchi, Washu is thinking of new plans to collect certain
"samples" from
him,-

<Mihoshi>Him who?
<Keone>Mr. Rogers.
<Washu>Ok Mr. Rogers, bend over. . .

Sasami is storing that month's carrot harvest in the pantry, Ryo-Ohki is
trying to eat
them, Katsuhito is tending to the Shrine, the Miho-Kiyo duo are watching a
soap opera and
Nobiyuki is begging Washu to install a video camera in the women's bath.

<Washu>Only if I can send the tape to america's funniest home videos. Ayeka
and Ryoko fighting nude is sorta funny.
<Mihoshi>Nah, the only tapes that win on that show have babies, kids, or
dogs in them.

But where, you ask, is Tenchi in all of this? He is avoiding the chaos in
his home, at least
temporarily, by trying to decide on the perfect ring to give his beloved
when finally asks her
to marry him.

<Kione>(Tenchi)Cool I get to be DeBeers shadow people now.

TENCHI: (Thinking) What about the emerald? Nah. It doesn't suit her. The
ruby is too flashy
for an engagement ring, and she isn't the type to go nuts over diamonds.
Hmm. Wait. Is
that a sapphire? It's perfect! (To clerk) How much for that one?
CLERK: Hmm. Fine choice. The sapphire is our most popular gem. That's the
last one in
stock, too. These normally run for 50,000 Yen, but I like you, kid, and you
obviously love this
girl, so I'll give you a deal: Half price. 25,000. Whaddya say?

<Washu>(Tenchi)I say that cheese toast is tastier than french fries.

TENCHI: Well, it's worth it. I mean, she is a very special woman. Here.
(Hands money to
salesman) Boy, she's just gonna love this! (Grabs ring, places it in his
pocket and runs back
to the house.)

Later That Day....

After Sasami has cleared the dinner table, Tenchi calls Nobiyuki, Katsuhito
and all of the girls
together in the living room.

<Mihoshi>All this time I thought Nobiyuki and Katsuhito were girls.

His hands are behind his back and he's looking very nervous.
NOBIYUKI: What's this all about, Tenchi? I have a package coming in later
and it's.. er.. very
important.

<Washu>Important for my uhh...to make sure it doesn't reduce in size.

TENCHI: We don't have time for your Hentai flicks, Dad.
NOBIYUKI: (Sweatdrops) How did you know?

<Kione>It's not that hard to figure out.

TENCHI: When I sent out all of those letters last week, I noticed one for
the "Hentai Of The
Month Club" and I knew that it could only be yours.

<Mihoshi>Hentai of the month?
<Washu>Yeah, you and Kione were on the cover of the last issue.
<Kione>So I was drunk...

KATSUHITO: (Whispering to Nobiyuki) That video wouldn't happen to show
French girls
banging each other, would it?
TENCHI: (Annoyed) Grandpa!

<Washu>(Tenchi)You said you'd only watch me banging French girls!

KATSUHITO: I was just curious!!
All of the girls face-vault at this. After they get up (and move away from
the two older men),
their curiosity gets the better of them.
MIHOSHI: What did you want to say, Tenchi?
KIYONE: Yeah. Mihoshi and I have to be back at our apartment in less than an
hour so that

<Washu>(As Kione)We can have rough, lesbian sex.

we can get ready for work.
TENCHI: Well, I want you all to know that I've finally come to a decision.
I've been observing
you girls for several months now, trying to decide which of you will be my
wife.
AYEKA: So THAT'S why he ignored every single piece of my Juraian lingerie!

<Washu>Juraian lingerie! Made of 100% genuine tree.
<Mihoshi> Yes, yours for only 300 yen! Turn off your dream guy in a matter
of seconds!
<Kione> Well, they are working for Ayeka in real life...

RYOKO: WHAT?!?!?!
AYEKA: Well, at least I don't slip into the shower when he's in there or
slide into his bed
butt-naked!

<Washu>(AS Ryoko)Well I do.

SASAMI: Ryoko, Ayeka, please let Tenchi finish. I just can't stand the
suspense any longer!
TENCHI: Thank you, Sasami. Now, I will state what I have observed in the
past year or so.
For starters, Washu keeps sending her robots up here to drag me down to her
lab and
strap me to a chair so that she can show me porno flicks and try to extract
one of her
"samples". This is not the kind of bride that I want.

<Mihoshi>(As Tenchi)Except that I do.
<Washu>::Blinks.::

WASHU: (Sweatdrops and makes a mad dash for her lab.)
TENCHI: As for Ayeka, well, she just knocked herself out of the running by
telling you guys
about the lingerie. I never would have expected the First Crown Princess of
Jurai to even
own such things, much less try to seduce me with them and then tell everyone
in the house
about it.

<Kione>The Jurian underwear sprung into action.

AYEKA: (Starts crying and runs up to her room.)
TENCHI: Mihoshi, you've got to be the simplest one here. All you do is beg
me to sleep with
you. While it does show me how much you care, I just don't feel that way
about you.

<Kione>(As Tenchi)Except that I do.

MIHOSHI: Alright, Tenchi. I'll abide by your decision. No matter what it is.
(Sits down on
couch and tries to keep from crying.)
TENCHI: Who next? Ah, Kiyone. In the past year, how many notes have you left
in my room
asking me to bathe with you or to take a vacation on the Yugami? Although it
is a romantic
gesture, and you are a nice girl, I'm just not attracted to you in that way.

<Washu>(As Tenchi)Except that I am.

KIYONE: Whatever you say, Tenchi. (Grabs Mihoshi, who has broken out in
tears by now.)
We've gotta get to work. I'll see you later, guys. (Walks out and shuts
front door.)
SASAMI: You're in love with me, right, Tenchi?
TENCHI: (Laughs) Oh, Sasami. While there is no doubt that you will be very
beautiful when
you get older, you're like the little sister that I never had. You are a
kind, sweet,
compassionate girl and the man that marries you will be one of the luckiest
men in
existence. I just won't be that man. I'm sorry, Sasmi. I know how much you
care, but I just
don't return those feeliings.

<Mihoshi>(As Tenchi)Except that I do.

SASAMI: Alright, Tenchi. (Hugs him.) I understand. I was just kidding,
anyway. (Goes into
kitchen with Ryo-Ohki in tow)
RYOKO: But, that must mean...? Oh no! Not her! How could you marry Sakuya?
She's a nice
girl and all, but what has she done to deserve you?
TENCHI: Well, first of all, she hasn't tried to kill anyone to get me. But
I've already told her
that I made my decision and that I didn't choose her. -

<Kione>(As Tenchi)Except that I did.

By the way, Dad, she said you were
cute and wants to have lunch with you. She said to call her if.... Hey,
where'd ya go??
NOBIYUKI: (Looks through Tenchi's address book) Where is she?
KATSUHITO: (Sweatdrops) He's hopeless.
TENCHI: Now, as I was about to say... (Gets down on one knee in front of
Ryoko and pulls out-

<Washu>A box of condoms. Have fun with Nobiyuki.

the ring.) Ryoko, I loved you from the moment I saw you. I wanted to tell
you a lot sooner, but every time I saw you after that, you were either
fighting with Ayeka or I got a nosebleed. Will you be my bride?
RYOKO: (Takes the ring and places it on her finger) Oh Tenchi! you have no
idea how happy
you've just made me. I do have a few confessions to make, however.

<Kione>In other words. No. Because Tenchi's mine.

TENCHI: What do you mean, "confessions"?
RYOKO: Well, I'm not a virgin. When I was Kagato's slave, he didn't exactly
limit my tasks to
plundering and destroying.

TENCHI: Well, I can't blame you for that.
RYOKO: The other confession is.... Well, maybe you'd better hear it from all
of us. All right girls, come back in!
Ayeka, Kiyone, Mihoshi and Washu come back into the room with broad smiles
on their faces.
TENCHI: You guys seem a little too happy after being rejected like that.

<Mihoshi>It's the mystery of life.
<Washu>Or incompetent fanfiction.
<Kione>Incompetent, or incontinent?
<Washu>Both.

AYEKA: Well, Lord Tenchi, you weren't the only one in this house that the
five of us were interested in.

<Kione>(Ayeka)Especially me. Rhyo-Ohki?! Where are you my love?
<Mihoshi>EWWWW!

TENCHI: Dad! You didn't!
NOBIYUKI: (Still trying to find Sakuya's number) Of course I didn't, Tenchi.
Although you can't say that I didn't try!
We hear a loud "CRACK!" as Katsuhito breaks a Kendo stick over Nobiyuki's
head and drags him out of the room.

<Washu>(Katsuhito) I told you that you could try and succeed on me anytime
but noooo, you want the girls. It is always the girls this and the girls
that. There is never any me time anymore... Never!!! ::Breaks down::
<Kione>There, there, I'm sure Roseanne will take you in.
<Washu>(Katsuhito) Really? you think so?

TENCHI: Please continue, Ayeka. This is beginning to sound like one of Dad's
videos.
AYEKA: I don't know how to break this to you, but all the fighing that Ryoko
and I did was
fake. We had to put up a good front so that you wouldn't suspect our true
motives. We all
did.

<Mihoshi>(Tenchi) And what were these true motives?
<Washu>(Ayeka) To watch the Brady Bunch meets Michael Jackson episode. It
was a special.
<Kione> Heheh, (Jackson) Hey Raymond... Come here a second...

KIYONE: Yeah. Ya see, Ryoko isn't the dominating slut that she made herself
out to be,
Ayeka really isn't a royal bitch, Washu isn't into kinky sex, I'm not some
kind of desperate
loner and Mihoshi isn't a total moron.

<Mihoshi> Yay! Wait.. Kione, does that mean we aren't partners?
<Kione> ::smiles:: I am starting to like this fic. ::Thinks:: Wait, no I'm
not.

WASHU: Kiyone is telling the truth. Mihoshi actually has an IQ of 186. A 150
or over is
considered a genius. She's just clumsy and a little absent-minded.
TENCHI: What's all this leading up to, anyway?

<Washu>Kinky sex. For the rest of the fic.

RYOKO: Well, we were all trying to win your heart, except Sasami, of course,
but we didn't
wanna wait on you to make a decision. So, we all get together in one of
Washu's
sub-dimensions once or twice a week and have an orgy.

<Washu>(Shocked)How did this fic writer find out about that?!?
<Mihoshi>Uh oh. . .

TENCHI: So, you're telling me you're all bisexual?
AYEKA: Yes. Sasami isn't, however, so I would appreciate it if you didn't
tell her about it.

<Washu> Then the closet door creaks open and we see Yugi and Sasami making
out.
<Kione>... (Sasami) Way ahead of you!

RYOKO: Tenchi, before we get married, I would like to say one more thing.
Over the past
several years and countless times of having sex with each other, the five of
us grew very
fond of one another. I couldn't commit myself to just you, Tenchi. I would
have to be with
the girls every now and then. Especially you, Ayeka. You're great with your
tongue.

::Mihoshi and Kione puke::
<Washu>(Ryoko)Yeah, there wasn't one drop of slurpy left in the cup.

AYEKA: (Blushing) Thank you, Ryoko.
TENCHI: (Thinks for a moment) Well, there's only one thing I can do.
MIHOSHI: What, Tenchi?
TENCHI: Well, I can't cut Ryoko off from you four in good conscience. You
girls obviously
enjoy it.
AYEKA: You mean...?
TENCHI: Yes. Since you girls are so close to each other, I can see no harm
in letting you
continue sleeping together.
RYOKO: Oh, thank you, Tenchi!
TENCHI: Wait! There is a catch, you know.
AYEKA: And what would that be?
TENCHI: You have to let me join in every now and then.

<All>OOC!

KIYONE: (Sweatdropping) Tenchi, you've become just as bad as your father.
TENCHI: Thanks!

<Washu> Wait... So now Tenchi wants to be like Nobiyuki? If that was true,
I'd have that sample by now...

The girls face-vault again as Tenchi laughs his head off.

One Week Later.....

Tenchi, clad in the tuxedo that Nobiyuki wore when he married Achika, is
waiting in the
Shrine for Ryoko, his one and only love-

<Mihoshi>But he wanted to join in on their gay orgy.
<Kione>Don't bother. None of this fic makes sense.

and soon-to-be bride, to leave her dressing room
and join him as they finalize all that they have been working for in the
past years. Nobiyuki
is standing off to the side.

<Washu>Doing nothing. As usual.

After what seems like an eternity, the music starts playing and Sasami walks
down the
aisle, scattering flower petals on either side of her. She stops and sits
down beside Washu
when she reaches the front row.
Soon after, Mihoshi and Kiyone start their own march down the red carpet.
Behind them is
Ryoko, followed by Ayeka and Sakuya, who seem to be silently flirting with
each other.

<Kione>(Ayeka)..................::wink::
<Mihoshi>(Sakuya).....................::Blows kiss::

TENCHI: (Thinking) Oh no! Not her, too!!!!
Ryo-Ohki, who had been in the arms of Washu, runs behind Ayeka and Sakuya,
past the
last row of seats and begins sniffing at a storage closet. The door opens
and who should
walk out but Ken-Ohki. The two cabbits stare at each other for a minute,
then take off
outside the shrine.

<Kione>(As Ayeka)NO! My Ryo-Ohki!!! How dare you cheat on me... Oh well, the
more the merrier! Now I get two furry geni-
<Washu> ::Interupts Kione:: Okay, we get the point. Ayeka is a
Cabbito-Sexual. Please stop now because these mental images are scary... yet
arousing...
<Mihoshi>Don't you start, Washu.
<Kione>Let's see what's going on outside.

::They leave the theatre. The others are all watching tv::
<Washu>What's on?
<Ryoko>Some weird cartoon.
<Kione>Where's Zero?
<Ayeka>Who cares?
<TV>We now return to Gungan Wing.
<Jar-Jar>Meesa Jar-Jar Yuy! Meesa perfect soldier!
<Washu>What the hell? What is this crap?
<Mihoshi>Some new show. I can't believe that they moved space police
policeman to 1am for this thing.
::Jar-Jar jumps into a gundam::
<Jar-Jar>Meesa use da booma!
::Jar-Jar promptly blows himself up::
<Jar-Jar>Uh oh, meesa bombad.
::Another gungan enters::
<Treize Nass> Well, meesa Treize Nass, meesa more bombad than yousa!
<Jar-Jar>No, yousa no more bombad than Jar-Jar Yuy!!!
<Ayeka>(sarcasticly)Look, they're fighting with each other. How cute.
<Treize Nass> Wesa see bout this.
::Treize Nass pulls out a gun wich he calls da booma::
<Kione>So everything in this world is called the boomba?
<Tenchi>That is all I could pick up so far.
::Trieze Nass shoots Jar-Jar Yuy but he misses and falls back::
<Treize Nass> Owchies!
<Kione>Well, it is no worse than regular gundam wing...
<Ryoko>You can say that again.
<TV>Thank you and that is our show! Stay tuned for Larry Flint the Time
Pornogropher!
<Tenchi>Dad would have a field day...
<Washu>Come on, Kione. I'd rather deal with the fic.
::They return to the theatre::

This, despite it's obvious indications, gets a room full of laughter.
But, unseen by all except for Tenchi, Katsuhito and Nobiyuki, another,
taller figure is
emerging from the closet. Clad in one of the sexiest-looking dresses Tenchi
has ever seen,
Nagi moves over to sit beside Washu. They exchange glances and then the
bounty hunter
gives Ryoko a short, seductive smile.

<Kione> And nobody cares that the uninvited Nagi was there.

TENCHI: (Thinking) Oh, boy! Now I have to share Ryoko with five other girls.
Plus, Nagi will
probably want to give me a test drive. (Sarcastically) This just keeps
getting better and
better!

<Kione> At this point, I think all males reading this want to kill Tenchi,
because I know I do.
<Washu> You're a male?
<Mihoshi>That's our little secret, hee hee
::Kione hits Mihoshi::

Ryoko stops at the end of the aisle and bows to Tenchi. Ayeka and Sakuya sit
down next to
Sasami.
KATSUHITO: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in the sight of God to
witness
these two people joined in the bonds of Holy matrimony. Tenchi Masaki, do
you take Ryoko
to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, to love and to
cherish, for richer or
poorer, as long as you both shall live?
TENCHI: I do.
Katsuhito: Ryoko, do you take Tenchi to be your lawfully wedded husband, to
have and to
hold, to love and to cherish, for richer or poorer, as long as you both
shall live?
RYOKO: I do.

<Mihoshi>Shouldn't it be a Shinto ceremony?
<Washu>Yeah, but this author was either too stupid to care or was too lazy
to research how their weddings were performed.

KATSUHITO: Does the best man have the rings?
NOBIYUKI: (Searches his pockets) Gee, I had the things right here. Lemme
see, where did I
put them? Ah, there they are! (Pulls rings out of shirt pocket and a nude
picture of Achika
falls out.

<Washu> Nobiyuki? A Necro? AHHHHH!

Several women cover their eyes and quite a few men get nosebleeds.) Heh,
heh.
Sorry. (Puts picture back in pocket.)
KATSUHITO: Tenchi, place the ring on Ryoko's finger and repeat after me:
With this ring, I
thee wed.
TENCHI: (Slowly puts ring on Ryoko's hand) With this ring, I thee wed.
KATSUHITO: Ryoko, place your ring on Tenchi's finger and repeat after me:
With this ring, I
thee wed.
RYOKO: (Reciprocates the previous motion of her beloved) With this ring, I
thee wed.
KATSUHITO: If anyone has any reason why these two should not be married, let
him speak
now, or forever hold your piece. (Room remains quiet) By the power given to
me as
caretaker of this Shrine, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the
bride.
Tenchi pulls his new wife into a full, passionate kiss and a cheer goes up
from the crowd.
They break the kiss, Ryoko turns to face Katsuhito and tosses her boquet
over her
shoulder. Nagi catches it and then stares seductively at Nobiyuki, who
starts looking
worried, much to the surprise of Tenchi. After the traditional dance and
wedding feast are
over, Tenchi and Ryoko begin to tear into the various gifts that have been
brought for them.

<Washu>Wow it's all the crap on TV for $19.95 that you can order from a PO
box.

After opening several kitchen appliances, a twenty-five piece steak knife
set, a wide-screen
TV, a DVD player and a stereo sytem complete with phonograph, five-CD
changer, dual tape
decks and an AM/FM radio from Nobiyuki's relatives, Achika's sister brings
over a rather large
box. Inside is a three-room intercom system, a telephone with answering
machine and a
back massaging system designed to fit under the sheets of a bed. Then the
other girls bring
in their gifts.
Mihoshi and Kiyone present Tenchi and Ryoko with something that will go
perfectly with
their TV: A Nintendo 64 complete with fifteen games. Nagi brings Ryoko a
hand-woven
tapestry of Ryo-Ohki, Ken-Ohki, Yugami and Ryu-Oh in orbit around Earth.
Ryoko thanks her
friend for the gift with a warm embrace.

<Kione>Nagi is. . . Ryoko's friend? Aggggggghhhhhh!!!!
<Mihoshi>Wow, what a twist.

Sasami walks over to Tenchi with a rather small
package. The box inside has the "Capsule Corp." logo on it.

<Washu>What-the...? DBZ?
<Mihoshi>And out pops Puar, the cute shape-shifting sex toy.

SASAMI: It's a complete home furnishing set. Living room, kitchen, bedroom,
just about
everything. Ayeka and I both pitched in to get it for you.

<Mihoshi>No! Dont go into the kitchen! It is really Puar waiting for you to
sit... And when you do, you wont have to drop the soap to get action!
<Washu>Um, no.

TENCHI: (Bows to Ayeka and Sasami) Thank you both. I was kinda wondering
what we'd do
for furiniture.
AYEKA: Think nothing of it, Lord Tenchi.
TENCHI: Well, that's everybody but Grandpa, Washu and Dad.
Nobiyuki comes up behind tenchi and whispers something in his ear.
TENCHI: Okay. Everybody, we thank you for coming to witness this joyous
occasion and for
the thoughtful gifts that you have brought us. We hope that we will be able
to see you
again soon.
After everyone except for Tenchi, Ryoko, Katsuhito, Nobiyuki, Sakuya, Nagi
and the rest of
the gang has left the Shrine, Washu motions for them to follow her to the
back of the
building, where a rather large object lay on the ground, covered by a huge
grey tarp.
WASHU: For you, my daughter, and your new husband. (Flings off the cover to
reveal a
large, closed-in ten-person high-altitude cruiser that could transform into
a van for planetary
use.) I thought you could use it.
As Tenchi and Ryoko are loading the rest of their gifts into the ship,
Nobiyuki speaks up.
NOBIYUKI: My gift is in the back, Tenchi.
TENCHI: Okay, Dad.
KATSUHITO: And mine is in the glove compartment. Now, I hate to leave so
soon, but I have
an important meeting with the rulers of Jurai.

<Kione>(Katsuhito) Er, yes... Important Jurain business. Very important...
<Mihoshi>Then the KY jelly falls out of his pocket...

I'll see you later.
With this, he walks off toward the spaceport. Tenchi and Ryoko get into the
vehicle, wave
goodbye to their friends, and head off toward their honeymoon suite in Las
Vegas, Nevada.
TENCHI: Hey, Ryoko. Open up the glove compartment. I wanna see what Grandpa
gave us.
RYOKO: Alright, my love. (Opens up the small door and produces an envelope.)
TENCHI: What's in it?
RYOKO: Let's see. (Tears open the envelope and pulls out a piece of paper
and a set of
keys.)
TENCHI: What does the note say?
RYOKO: (Reading aloud) Dear, Tenchi and Ryoko. I hope you enjoy the
two-story condo in
Tokyo. It's not just from me, but Ayeka's parents and Tsunami, as well. I'm
sure that you'll
take care of it. From the bottom of my heart, I only wish that Achika could
have been here to
see this. But I know that she is proud of you, Tenchi. You have a very fine
bride

<Kione>Real fine. She only totaled Jurai..
<Mihoshi>She only put the universe into sudden peril.
<Washu>But she was only a baby back then... ::sniff:: Those were the days...

and I know that your marriage will be at least as strong as the one that
Achika and Nobiyuki shared. I only hope that Ryoko doesn't die when your son
is five years old. OW!

<Washu>(Nobiyuki)Yeah! Take it all, bitch!

What hit me? Oh,well. It's almost time for the wedding and I have to get
ready. Good luck and may your
future be as bright as the sun.

Sincerely,
Your Grandfather,
Katsuhito

P.S.: Beware of Nobiyuki's gift.

TENCHI: (After a moment of thought) I wonder what he meant by that? Bring
that box up
here, Ryoko. I wanna see why Dad didn't give it to me at the wedding.
Ryoko fades out for a second and she then reappears beside Tenchi holding a
rather large
cardboard box.
RYOKO: Let's see what's inside this one. (Opens it up to reveal...... a
sizable collection of
pornographic DVDs and magazines)
TENCHI: (Sweatdrops) Now I know what he meant.
RYOKO: (Smiling seductively) Well, I know of a way that we can put it to
good use.
TENCHI: You sure do know how to turn a guy on, Ryoko.

Later, In Vegas.....

Tenchi and Ryoko land on the outskirts of the city, convert their ship to a
very good-looking
white van and drive the rest of the way to the hotel.
After they check in and are given their keys, they make their way to the top
floor.
TENCHI: Here it is. Room 935.
He unlocks the door, picks his bride up, carries her through the door, lays
her on the bed,
and kisses her tenderly.
RYOKO: Oh, my Tenchi, this has been the happiest day of my life. I married
the man of my
dreams, you finally know the truth about me and the other girls, and I found
out that
Ryo-Ohki is pregnant.

<Washu>(Ryoko)I also found out that it wasn't because of Ayeka this
time...::Smiles::...
<Kione>Hey! You said hold off on the Cabbit sex jokes!

TENCHI: What?? You mean that she and Ken-Ohki...? I knew that she loved him,
but I didn't
think that they'd take it that far.
RYOKO: You'd be surprised what cabbits do when when their masters aren't
around.

<Mihoshi>And what they do with their masters...
<Washu>And what their masters do to them
<Kione>Aughh! Stop it!

Ryo-Ohki even has a picture of Ken-Ohki that she cuddles with at night. It's
romantic, but
also disturbing at the same time.
TENCHI: I know what you mean. Washu has a camera in the men's bath. She
keeps giving
Mihoshi and Kiyone movies of me. I found out last night. I never knew they
liked me THAT
much.

<Washu> Duh. How many clues do you need?

RYOKO: They're not the only ones with movies, Tenchi. Washu gives all of the
ones that she
takes of me and Ayeka and sells them to Nobiyuki.
TENCHI: I've GOT to get some of those! Ever since I found out about the
whole thing, I've
been wanting to see you five in action together.

<All>OO- oh, what's the point?

RYOKO: Well, if you play your cards right, you'll be able to see what went
on last night at
the party that the girls gave me. (Holds her right hand up and a video
cassette appears out
of nowhere) If you can prove your worth, I'll give you a show you won't soon
forget and
may have the pleasure of experiencing very soon.
TENCHI: What do you mean, 'prove my worth'?
RYOKO: You have to show me how good you are in bed. If you're good enough,
then you
can see the tape and I might even get Washu to open her dimensional tunnel
in here and
you can experience it first-hand. (Sets tape beside bed) Now, do you want to
build up to it
with a little foreplay or jump right into it?
TENCHI: There'll be plenty of time for foreplay later. (Takes off his shoes,
jacket, tie, shirt,
pants and socks, revealing his muscular body and seven-inch dick)
RYOKO: I never knew you were so big, Tenchi. I never got to see this thing
up close. Now,
it's time for you to see me. (Removes her shoes and dress so that her new
husband can get
a good, long look)
TENCHI: Ryoko, you have got to be the most beautiful woman in the world. I
only wish that
I could have done this sooner. (Takes his manhood and plunges it deep into
her)
RYOKO: Oh, Tenchi! You've done this before! Only a man who's had a lot of
sex can be this
good!

<Kione>Yeah, only an experienced sex guy would think of doing that.
<Washu>Why must we constantly wade through the mastabatory fantasies of
teenagers who will never use their genitals for purposes other than
disposing of wastes?
<Mihoshi>Because of Clay.
<Washu>Oh, yeah. Him.

TENCHI: I hope you don't mind me saying this, but I got a bit of practice
here and there with
Sakuya.
RYOKO: That's alright, Tenchi. I've slept with her a few times, myself. And
so has Ayeka,
Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Nagi...

<Washu> Okay, how would Sakyua know Nagi if they are from different series?
<Mihoshi> Cyber Sex?

TENCHI: That girl really gets around.
RYOKO: Yeah. Of course, when you've got seven bisexual women who are totally
horny, the
possibilities are endless.
TENCHI: (Still humping her) So, have Nagi and Sakuya been invited to one of
your little
'parties' yet?
RYOKO: Oh yeah. The first time Ayeka and I saw Sakuya in Tokyo, we both got
so horny we
couldn't stand it. We had to take each other right there in your apartment
and then we
slipped a note into Sakuya's backpack, telling her where to go if she wanted
to have a little
fun. Once she saw the six of us totally naked and wrapped up in each other's
arms, she
threw that school uniform off and jumped in between Nagi's legs. I've never
seen Nagi have
so many orgasms in a half hour. It was at least twenty.
TENCHI: Sakuya must've been real good. I knew she did a great blowjob, but I
had never
thought of her having sex with women.
RYOKO: Niether did we, but Ayeka thought it'd be fun to try. Hey, isn't it a
little wierd that
we're sitting here talking while screwing each other?
TENCHI: Not really. Sakuya is a regular chatterbox when she's getting laid.
It's one of those
things that I've gotten used to.
RYOKO: Yeah. The first time I s;ept with her, the only time she stopped
talking was when
she reached her climax. The only time she didn't talk when she had sex was
when Mihoshi
was eating her. And I can understand why. She may seem too innocent to some
people, but
she's definately one of the best women I've slept with. AAAHHHH!!!
Ryoko was completely engulfed in pleasure as Tenchi's constant humping
brought her to
orgasm, sending waves of pleasure through her like she had never experienced
before.
After it died down, she lay there, her chest heaving as she struggled to
catch her breath.
RYOKO: That was... great, but ..... I've still got.... more left. You?
TENCHI: Yeah, but not much. I'm gonna explode any second now!
With these final words, he cried out in pleasure and shot his load deep
within his bride.
Ryoko moaned and had three more orgasms, one after another. When the two
lovers were
spent, Tenchi pulled out of his bride and lay beside her, breathing heavily.
TENCHI: Wow. I never felt anything like that. Sakuya was really too tight
for me to last very
long and Nagi always wanted to be in control,

<Kione> Since when did Tenchi screw Nagi?

which means she always made me cum after less than a minute. Washu would
just strap me to a table and gave me a blowjob, so, while it was enjoyable,
it was nothing compared to this. Mihoshi always wanted a sixty-nine,
Kiyone would just drag me into the bath and do whatever she pleased and
Ayeka always
had Azaka and Kamidake to stand guard so that nobody could see us. I never
felt
comfortable with that and I didn't get to enjoy it as much, but she's a real
demon in the
sack!
RYOKO: (Pretending to be angry) You mean to tell me that you slept with all
those girls and
you never even told me? How do expect me to enjoy our marriage if you don't
tell me when
you're sleeping with the girls so that I can watch?
TENCHI: Sorry, hun. Next time, I'll be sure and tell you or bring a video
camera. Speaking of
sex tapes.... (Points to the cassette laying on the bedside table)
RYOKO: Oh, yes. Silly me. (Picks tape up, puts it in the VCR and presss the
'Play button)
TENCHI: (Whistles) I never knew that Kiyone and Washu went at it like that!
It's like they
only live for sex!

<Keone>Washu? Ewwwwww
<Washu>Keone? Ewwwwww
<Mihoshi>Aw, you guys would be cute together.
::Keone hits Mihoshi::

RYOKO: Well, that's really all that those girls live for. I, however, live
for sex and your love,
my Tenchi.
TENCHI: Um, Ryoko? I thought Nagi hated you. Have things always been like
this?
RYOKO: No. Actually, the only reason she hunted me all those years was
because she heard
how good I was in bed. If she had only asked me, I would have gladly slept
with her.

<Mihoshi>::shakes her head::

TENCHI: Is it my imagination, or do I see you and Washu there in the middle
of that field?
RYOKO: That's not your imagination. Washu's pretty damn good. Of course, any
of the girls
would say that. She did, after all, write the Universal Kama Sutra book.
TENCHI: Um, I don't mean to offend you, but isn't you sleeping with Washu,
you know,
incest? She is your mother and all.
RYOKO: She explained everything to me before we started all this. She simply
used her
genes to give me my basic body shape.

<Keone>Oh, I get it. She just contributed to her genetic heritage, so it's
not like this is incest for some reason.
<Washu>Well, if your brain is really your dick that makes sense.

TENCHI: Well, she made a mighty fine shape.
RYOKO: Shut up and kiss me.
With this, she pulled him into a deep, passionate kiss and started probing
his mouth with
her tongue.

<Washu>(TIE Fighter pilot)Transport Omega 1, this is TIE Fighter Alpha 3,
ready for inspection of Tenchi's mouth.
<Mihoshi>(Stormtrooper aboard Omega 1)Read you, Alpha 3, we have found
located inside Tenchi's mouth, a
piece of dental floss, and a kanker sore.
<Washu>That will be enough for now, Omega 1. Return to the Hanger of ISD
Magestic and prepare for the next mission:
the probing of Ayeka's butt. We must find what the rebels are stashing away
in Ayeka's butt.

Tenchi reciprocated and, in less than a minute, he was plunging into her
again-

<Keone>With a toilet plunger.

as the tape played on. After a few hours, the two were asleep in each
other's arms.

<Mihoshi>"Romance with a rather graphic sex scene" my ass. There wasn't much
romance, or good sex, for that matter.

THE END

I hope you liked my first Tenchi Muyo! fic.

<Washu>Let's see. Catholic wedding, OOC characters, and incompetent sex
scene. What do you guys think?
<Mihoshi>I give it 2 stars because space lesbian orgies are funny.
<Keone>I give 1/2 of a star because I should be with Tenchi.
<Washu>And I give it 0 stars because it entirely sucked.

If I get enough good reviews, I might write a sequal.

<All>NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!WE'RE DOOMED TO AN ETERNITY OF...uhm...THIS!!

This might turn into a whole series.

::They all just sit there with their mouths wide open.::

As always, you can e-mail me with yourcomments/suggestions and I invite open
conversation via
the AOL Instant Messenger, theMSN Messenger Service and the Yahoo!
Messenger. CYA!!!!!!

<Washu>He uses aol. Suddenly everything has fallen into place.
<Keone>Aol. Internet service for people who still use the L key as a one.
<All>I hate AOhell.

::Washu is sitting reading a book. Ryoko is drinking 'tea' (haha like that
fools anyone above 4)::
<Ryoko>This ish good tea (tries to restrain laughter).
<Washu>Yeah. It's the best (tries not to giggle).
::Tenchi enters::
<Tenchi>Hey, have you guys seen the sake?
<Ryoko>Haha, Tenchi said the s-word!
<Washu>Oopsie.
<Tenchi>Oh, yeah, I mean the, um, tea?
<Ryoko>It's right over there.
<Tenchi>Oh. Good thing you told me, because I couldn't find the um, . . .

:Sasami enters::
<Sasami>That doesn't look like tea to me.
<Tenchi>It is though, it's um. . . . special tea.
<Ryoko>Hahahahahah
::Clay appears on the screen::
<Clay>If that's tea I'm grandma moses. But anyway, you know the drill.
Toodles. ::Disappears::
<Washu>Danielle Steele is the best!
<Tenchi>Uhoh, fanficion sign!
::Tenchi, Ryoko and Ayeka go into the theatre::

Tenchi, Torn and Worn

Yes, I think you all know that I DON'T OWN THESE CHARACTERS!!!

<Ryoko>No, I'm actually bladedge34's whore.
<Ayeka>Yeah. Me too.

Well that's that. Please make suggestions in your reviews for I am not to
good an author,-

<Tenchi>I could've told you that.
<Ryoko>Oh, c'mon. This is the first non-conceited author. They're actually
saying they suck.Give them credit.

but I wish to become a good one soon.

<Ryoko>So much for my theory.
<Ayeka>I just lost all respect I had for this author.
<Tenchi>Stop lying. You never had any respect for this author.

Now this is a fanfic for both Ryoko+Tenchi and Ayeka+Tenchi likers.(but
whose ever heard of a Ayeka+Tenchi liker?)

<Ayeka>I TAKE THAT AS AN INSULT!
<Ryoko>I think that was what they were going for.
<Ayeka>I will make sure that they are hanged in the Juarai tree
court.::Insane laughter.::
<Tenchi>Taking it far there, are we?
<Ayeka>SHUT UP YOU CYAN-HAIRED FOOL!!!
<Tenchi>Umm... Ayeka?
<Ayeka>WHAT!?!
<Tenchi>That was me.
<Ayeka>What's the differacnce?
<Ryoko>Tenchi is Tenchi, and I am me.
<Ayeka>Oh. Okay.
Also, the writer of the Ohayo Tenchi! (no need for RE, Vampire Slayer,
Deathmatch, halloween,) has inspired me! So thank you!! Also, I am planning
on a Tenchi version of 'Shaggy: It wasn't me' song in the future
, so please, enjoy.

<Tenchi>We'll try.

(AN: this is a merge of all Tenchi series, leave out eveything you've ever
seen in the movie: Tenchi forever, if the rumors are true about what happens
in the end……)
One normal morning in the Masaki home, Sasami was serving breakfast to
everyone.

<Ayeka>I hope it's not elephant penis.
(MSTer's note:See previous MST, Extremely Sick Sex Fest-MSTed.)
<Tenchi>AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
<Ryoko>AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
<Ayeka>AAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
<Tenchi>AAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Oh wow, it smells fabulous!!!" Mihoshi had been fasting as her punishment
for destroying the living room with her newly delivered weapon.

<Ryoko>What weapon? All these authors have a tendency to start their fics in
the center of the story.

And Ryoko and Ayeka were fighting over Tenchi as usual.
"But he even said the exact words, he said 'that means you two are destined
for eachother' and put our hands in each others!!!"

<Tenchi>WHAT THE-???AAHHHHH!!!!!!
<Ayeka>Yeah, that didn't make much sense, did it?
<Ryoko>If you can read backwards read can you iF.

"Yeah well just cause your princess and he's prince don't mean he ever liked
you!!!"
"Ugh, will you two please SHUT UP!!!" screamed Tenchi

<Ryoko&Ayeka>OOC!!!!

"Oh Lord Tenchi, -whisper-whisper--whisper-whisper" in Tenchi's ear

<Tenchi>Who is whispering?
<Ayeka>It was Mickey Mouse.
<Tenchi>Oh. Really?
<Ayeka>Yeah. Really. Mickey mouse appeared out of no where, whispered into
your ear,
and called you "Lord Tenchi".Dumbass

Tenchi's face became pale, sweat drop forming, then Ryoko leaned over
"Oh yeah? "-whisper-whisper-whisper-"
Tenchi became very pale as Ryoko and Ayeka were both whispering things in
each one of Tenchis' ears
"Ryoko, you little sicko!" shouted Washu, hearing every one of Ryokos'
thoughts.
In the afternoon Tenchi was thinking in his bedroom.-

<Tenchi>Thinking about what makes the new waffle formula so waffleicous.

^all these women and one me!! Oh, wait, I should only think of two cause
Mihoshi, Kiyone, Washu and Sasami don't really count…^ he thought, picking
up the remote and turning off his (new) BIG screen tv that was in the middle
of saying
"6 girls under one roof all have the hots...for hi-"-click!-

::Everyone shakes their head.::
<Tenchi>I think the author gave up. Since they weren't making any sense,
they just gave up and did this on purpose.
<Ayeka>Or the author has no writing talent.
<Ryoko>I agree with Ayeka.

Tenchi began to think about Ryoko and Ayeka and decided a stroll in the
woods would clear his mind.

<Tenchi>I hope it isn't THAT kind of walk in the woods.
(MSTer's note:See Story about Washu and Mihoshi parts 7-15-MSTed.)
<Ryoko>The kind when we have rough sex, and Ayeka and I are bi for no
reason?
<Tenchi>Bullseye.

Ayeka was following Tenchi through the woods (AN:Ryoko lovers, don't get
pissed, this is not a Ryoko+Tenchi OR a Ayeka+Tenchi fic!!!) She walked up
to him grabbed his shoulder and said

<Ryoko>(Ayeka)Do you have any Grey Poupon?

"Lord ^DOH!-

<Ayeka>(Homer) DOH! I like Beer. I like Doughnuts. DOH!

Why do I say LORD Tenchi when this is romantic matters!!!^ Tenchi? Do you
have free time at 8:00 tonight???"
"Well..I..Ummm..how will we get there?"
"You do??? Great! I'll meet you at the front of Washu's new portal to Tokyo!
She ran off, then Ryoko teleported in front of him
"Say Tenchi, got some time of to spend with your sweet Ryoko at 8:30
tonight?"
She said, mischevious grin forming
"And remember Tenchi, -whisper-whisper-whisper-"
"Umm..uhhhh.."Tenchi replied, with a sweat drop

<Ryoko>Hey Ayeka, don't forget about the whisper-whisper-whisper.
<Ayeka>Huh?
<Ryoko>You know? The Whisper-whisper-whisper.
<Ayeka>Oh yeah. That.
<Tenchi>You guys are nuts.

"You will go out with me!?! Great, see you in the rafters, we'll teleport to
Tokyo!!!"
Then she teleported away.
Later that night at 7:54, Tenchi wasn't really prepared for his double date.

<Ayeka>It's not really a double date.
<Tenchi>Lets take a break.

::Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi walk out of the theatre, to find Washu and Sasami
watching TV.::
<Ryoko>What are you watching?
<Sasami>The discovery channel, Croc Hunter, but it's a commercial.
::On the screen is the newest Discovery.com commercial.::
<Morpheus>Hello Neo.
<Neo>Hello Morpheus.
<Morpheus>Have you heard about the new website Discovery.com?
<Neo>Yes, it taught me how to kill the dude, how to be a cool dude, and how
to get girls to like me.
<Morpheus>Oh. It taught me how to polish my cool sunglasses really shiny.
<Neo>Well, it taught me about the matrix.
<Morpheus>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHhhhhhhhh the matrix. . . .
<Neo>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHhhhhhhhh the matrix. . . .
<Switch>Why am I here?
<Apock>Beats me.
::The commercial ends and goes to that annoying Verizon wireless
commercial.::
<Ryoko>Hey, that looks like fun. Let's try it.
<Tenchi>Ok.
<Ryoko>Hello Tenchi.
<Tenchi>Hello Ryoko.
<Ryoko>Have you heard about the new website Discovery.com?
<Tenchi>Yes, it taught me how to score on all the space pussy, rip off star
wars, and rake the leaves in front of the shrine.
<Ryoko>Oh. It taught me how to think sake is really tea.
<Tenchi>Well, it taught me about the jurai power.
<Ryoko>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHhhhhhhhh the jurai power. . . .
<Tenchi>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHhhhhhhhh the jurai power. . . .
<Ayeka>Well, that was weird.
<Tenchi>Never mind, we have fanfic sign!
::Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko return to the theatre::

He knew that Ayeka would want to kiss him like crazy and get quite annoying,
and Ryoko would just embarrass him with her bad temper.
^oh my, what am I gonna do?^ he thought to himself as he headed out to the
portal
"So ya ready my sweet Lord ^DOH!-

<Ryoko>(Homer) DOH! I like Doughnuts. Thank you, Mr. Burns.

^ Tenchi!?!"
Tenchi turned around and became pale with a sweat drop as he saw what Ayeka
wore
"Who Ayeka, you really, um, outdid yourself?"
Ayeka was wearing an (almost, no not totally)

<Tenchi>Damn. I was really SOOOO eager to see Ayeka's underwear.
<Ayeka>I could arrange that.

see through blue dress which was cut at a (almost all the way) revealing
spot
"Like my dress? Let's get going!"
She had to force him to get arm and arm with her as they headed through the
portal to Tokyo
They warped onto a small spot in the city, a high spot, in the city, really
high
"AAAHHH!!! DUMB WASHU AND HER STUPID PORTALS!!!" screamed Ayeka as she
looked down from the tall building
"Well Washu has been known to send people to the wrong spots"
"At least there's a romantic view up here."
(AN:RYOKO LOVERS DON'T WORRY, SHE (RYOKO) GETS HER TURN SOON!!!!!)
Said Ayeka, cuddling close to Tenchi, his leg being halfway forced up her
dress
He became very pale and blood practically drained from his face
He almost fainted and that caused his head to go on Ayeka's shoulder
"Oh, Tenchi..you're so romaaaaantic"
Tenchi's leg was pretty much ALL the way up her dress (AN: No, just his leg,
not his, you know, thing!)

<Tenchi>This was written by a teenage girl. I can sense it now.

Tenchi really couldn't take much more and decided it was time to go home
after a while, except when they headed through the portal…
They were in a jungle
"I HATE YOU WASHU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"please Ayeka, calm dow-ahhh!!!!"
He tripped and started to fall down a hill which caused him to look a bit
disoriented when he got up
"I'm coming Tenchi!!" shouted Ayeka
Then she tripped as well and her hair got totally ruffled out and part of
her dress was pulled over her shoulder
"Let's just go back to the portal!!!" Ayeka said as she ran back up to the
weird warp
Luckily this time they were back home.

<Ryoko>Wow what a great date. You go to the top of a building, he puts his
leg up your dress, you go to the jungle,
then you go back. What fun.

When they got back inside he rushed Ayeka inside,

<Ayeka>Huh? wha?

his hair was messed up, and his clothes were a bit ruffled, and Ayeka's hair
was messy to and one side of her dress was still pulled over her s
houlder. They both looked tired, then his father appeared and walked over to
him as Ayeka moved out of the room
"Ohh, my sweet son, you've really done it haven't you!?! You're a grown man
cause you've done it! You look just how I looked the first morning of me and
your mothers honeymoon! Didn't it feel goo-"

<Tenchi>This was truly written by a sex-crazed horny teenage girl.

"DAAAAD!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"
"Don't be embarrassed my sweet talking son..."
"DAD, SHADDUP ALREADY!!!"
screamed Tenchi as he ran to the rafters
Ryoko phased in right in front of him
She was wearing practically the same dress as Ayeka,

<Ayeka>EWWWWWWW!
<Ryoko>No that's the teenage girl's shallow way of saying things are
similar.

except gray
"So my sweet Tenchi are ya ready"
"Well uhhhh......."
"Remember, we do this enough and-whisper-whisper-whisper-"
"RYOKO!!! You sicko!!! When'd you get so hardcore sexy!?!" Washu shouted
upwards
Yeah, you know, nosebleed time!

<All>WHAT THE FUCK!

When they phased into Tokyo Ryoko pointed out of few fancy restraunts
"Ooohhhh, that one called 'all kinds o' food from america' looks good!"
"Uhh, sure, I would pay but-"
"Oh, that's OK my Tenchi, I brought some extra yen!"
They both rushed to the restraunt
When the waiter came, Ryoko ordered for both of them quickly
"Sphakity!!! (AN:Not knowing how to pronounce it) oh yeah and..."
(she whispered in the waiters ear)
"I need 2 really long noodles, one starting on one of our plates and ending
on the other's…"
-wink- -wink back-
When the sphaghetti arrived Tenchi was the first to eat, Ryoko quickly
switched the long noodle onto his fork and put the other end on her fork,
unfortunately, Tenchi simply bit off the excess of the noodle
"No Tenchi, the traditional way is to suck the whole noodle into your mouth"
she did the switch with the noodles again

<Ayeka>And the author forgot all its problems. Including punctuation, folks.

Then they both had an end in their mouth, they both began to try and suck
the noodle in
This time they're lips came quite close
"MMMMMMMMPPPPPPHHHHHHH!!!!!!" Tenchi managed a grumble as he and her nearly
kissed and he bit off the excess at the last second
Then a gunshot was heard and a robber's voice
"This a stickup!!!"
"Who let's get out of here!"

<Tenchi>Who let's get out of here? do they mean doctor Who, or the band?

yelled Tenchi as he grabbed Ryoko and ran out
"Let's get somewhere more private"
said Ryoko, mischevious grin forming as they phased on top of a tall
building
"uh-oh" Tenchi said, sweat drop forming
"Oh my Tenchi, It's so romantic up on this building, you can see the whole
city"
she said, cuddling close to him
"well..ummmm..I..uhhhh.."
"Oh, is my Tenchi nervous?"
"duuhhh.." Tenchi could pretty much see through that dress by then
"Well what do you have to say?"
"Uhhhhh...(suddenly and quickly) It's 9:07 let's go!!!"
"What!?!"
"Just get us back please!"
"Ok"
They phased back to the house and Ryoko gave Tenchi her grin and headed to
the rafters
Tenchi sat on the roof pondering his dates

<Tenchi>Hmm... and I bet that robber shot the fuck out of everyone,
stole all the money, and ate Ryoko's left over spaghetti. All in a day's
work.

^Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryoko, Ayeka.I barely love either of them...^
Ayeka climbed and sat beside him
"Tenchi, I've been thinking, and-"
Then Ryoko phased next to him
"Tenchi, your sweethart has been thinking, and-"
(simultaneously)"WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!?!?"

<Ryoko>Huh?

Tenchi decided it was time to leave and let the two 'talk' but he was
grabbed by both of them
"Oh but Tenchi's in love with me!!!"
"But we practically kissed, right Tenchi!?!"
"oh yeah-"
blablablablablablabla!!!!!!!!!!!!
It all became a blurr in Tenchi's ears as Ryoko powered up an energy ball
Suddenly two flying logs burst through the ceiling sending Ryoko to the left
and Ayeka to the right and Tenchi straight through the ceiling and onto his
own bed, dazed, he thought to himself ….
^Ryoko or Ayeka...the world may never know...^

<Tenchi>How many licks does it take to get to the center of Ryoko or Ayeka?
The world may never know.

THE END!-

<Tenchi>OF REALITY.
<Ayeka>You are living in a dream world, Tenchi.
<Ryoko>There is no spoon.

Stinger Clip:"Remember, we do this enough and-whisper-whisper-whisper-"
"RYOKO!!! You sicko!!! When'd you get so hardcore sexy!?!" Washu shouted
upwards
Yeah, you know, nosebleed time!
