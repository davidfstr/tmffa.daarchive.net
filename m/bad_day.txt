Bad day.


Summary: Well....a little fic I am writing 'cause I'm
bored out of my mind! My first song fic so I know it
stinks.

[Proofreader's note from Blue-Haired Goddess: It
doesn't stink! This is cool! [Image] ]

Note: I don't own Tenchi Muyo or the song Bad Day.
I'm not making any money by writing this fic. So
don't sue me!

I had a bad day again.
She said I would not understand.
She left a note and said: 'I'm sorry,
I-I had a bad day again.'

Ryoko sat up on her rafter allowing one leg to dangle
over the side. Yet another day, another day she
wished she didn't have to go through, a day....like
every day.

And she swears there's nothing wrong.
I here her playing that same old song.
She puts me up and puts me on.

The life she lived was one of pain and sadness and
hurting. The love of her life didn't love her back.
Her golden eyes looked out the window at the setting
sun. The pain almost always went away with the day.
At night she was alone and not one person could hurt
her when she was alone.

Had a bad day again.
She said I would not understand.
She slammed the door and said:
'I'm sorry I-I had a bad day again.'

*It really only hurts when you cry, little Ryoko.*
Washu's voice sounded in her head. Ryoko growled.
*Get out of my head, MOM!* Ryoko snapped. It was
just like Washu to ruin her moments alone. *I wish
you wouldn't keep me out of your life, my child.*
*You weren't part of my life for years! Why should I
love you now?*

And she swears there's nothing wrong.
I hear her playing that same old song.
She puts me up and puts me on.

*Your not going to win him by crying.* Washu said.
Ryoko's eyes widened. *What?* She asked. *Little
Ryoko, don' t give up on it yet. He'll come around.*
With this Washu left her head. Ryoko sat up and
looked out the window.

Ohh. I had a bad day again.
She said I would not understand.
She left a note and said:
'I'm sorry I-I had a bad daaaaayyyyy again.'

Ryoko grinned a little. Life wasn't so bad...not
really.

She left a note and said:
'I'm sorry I-I-I Had a bad DAAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!'

The sun set, leaving the cyan haired demoness alone
with her thoughts. It wasn't such a bad life...not
with Tenchi, anyway.
