*********************************
On to the MST...
*********************************

The new fanfic theater has been built and is under siege by the
infamous, er, VERY COOL, owner Quatre Raberba Winner.

The MSTers are:

Timothy Turner:  An author of MSTs and a loser.

Mark Rothlisberger:  Friend of Tim's, the co-author, and also a loser.

Duo Maxwell:  Gundam pilot.  The MSTers are trapped thanks to him.

Keiichi Morisato:  "Aa! Megami-sama!"'s loser who isn't quite
a loser anymore because of that lucky call.  Acting suspicious
with Belldandy.

Belldandy:  Chanting and praying.  We'll probably need it from now on.

*********************************

::Duo, Mark, and Tim are walking around the lobby.  It seems Quatre's
minions have all left.  But have they?::

Mark:  We need a plan.  And we need it FAST!

Tim:  Yeah.  Everyone, huddle up!

::Keiichi and Belldandy are holding hands and praying.::

Tim:  You two!  Come on!

::The couple continue in their prayer.::

Duo:  Come on!  We need to get out of here!

Keiichi:  Bye!

Mark:  What?

Belldandy:  Keiichi and I are going to live out our lives for all
eternity outside this theater.  The MST life isn't for us.

Tim:  What are you saying?

Keiichi:  Later.  And good luck!

::Both Keiichi and Belldandy start to disappear.::

All:  NOOOOOOO!!!!!!  TAKE US WITH YOU, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!  HELP US!!!!!

Belldandy and Keiichi:  You started this idea!  You finish it!  Goodbye!
::Both disappear.::

All:  WAIT!!!!  DON'T LEAVE US!!!!  IT'S DUO'S FAULT!!!!  NOOOO!!!!!!

::The remaining MSTers cry.::

Mark:  We'll just have to get out ourselves!

Quatre:  That's too bad!  I have a lemon for you.  And it's not a
rerun of "MGP Noboyuki".  It's called "Noboyuki's Secret"  Now
get in there and watch it!

::The remaining MSTers walk into the theater with a look of woe on
their faces.:

>Hey this is my first lemon. Please enjoy. Ohh and I dont own any of
>that copy right junk,
>BLAH BLAH

Tim:  The shortest disclaimer to date.

>Nobuyuki’s Secret.

Duo:  He's gay.

>By
>Mr. Sinister

Mark:  With a sinister tendency to write lemons.

>This takes place after the girls hear about Tenchi’s new girlfriend in

Mark:  That bitch, Sakuya?!

>Tokyo and they want
>to visit him, but they need to get money so they are trying to steal
>Nobuyuki’s money. The
>scene is the living room.

>"WHERE IS IT??!!" Ryoko screamed into Nobuyuki’s ear.

>"Where is what?" Replied Nobuyuki

Duo:  The author of this story's brain.

>"THE MONEY" Said Royko

Tim:  'Royko'?  Is Ryoko really a man?

Mark:  Royko...  The gigolo / she-male story.

>"Please tell us where it is, we want to see Tenchi" said Sesami

All:  ::singing::  COULD YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET...HOW TO GET TO
SESAMI STREET?!

>"Yeah and we want to see him with Sakua. Tenchi belongs to me, and only
>me" said Ryoko quietly

Tim:  (as Ryoko)  But I wouldn't mind having a threesome.  Or recording
our nasty action.

Duo:  Sakua?  Where did this guy learn to spell?...Quatre?

Quatre:  ::out of the projection booth:: I HEARD THAT!  THAT'S ANOTHER
TWO YEARS SENTENCE!

Mark:  ::hits Duo in the face:: Thanks a lot, asshole!

>"Look I’m getting sick and tired of you girls always taking my

Tim:  Porno magazines!

Duo:  Scotch tape and paper clips!

Mark:  8 tracks!

>money. IT’S MINE.

Tim:  Uhh...Sure...Like it's yours.  The first thing women take when
they live with you is money.  And I don't care if they're raising kids
without a job, IT'S THEIRS.  Fact of life...  A man is dirt poor the
moment the poor sap lays his eyes on a woman.

>If you want to see Tenchi go get a job and make your own money.

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  Three words:  Red light district...

>I work day and ......"

Duo:  I work the ...... shift, too, man.  Know what you mean.

Mark:  Man, the grammar in this sucks.

>Nobuyuki suddenly stopped while he felt a hard fist into his stomach
>coming from Ryoko.

All:  FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!

>"No why did you do that?" Mehoshi said looking really worried. She had

Duo:  ::imitating Ryoko and the bad grammar::  Know I don't no!  Maybe
its because I like you.

>one tear coming from her left eye

Tim:  With all the detail in this fic, you think the author would check his
SPELLING AND GRAMMAR!

>while she ran and grabbed Nobuyuki before he fell to the floor.

>"That was a bit harsh, but it was acceptable. Since we do need the
>money to see Lord Tenchi" Aeka said, with her snotty nose up high.

Tim:  Uhh...she'd better wipe her nose...its snotty.  That's real
disgusting.

Mark:  Well at least he spelled Aeka's name right.

"Yeah please let us have the money to see Tenchi, we only care for him"
Kyone said with

Tim:  ::screams::  TOO MANY MISTAKES...AAAGGGRRAAAHHH!!!!!!

::Tim starts to tear out the seats in the theatre.::

Mark:  Ok...snack time.

::Everyone gets up and leaves the theatre to go to the snack bar.::

::Tim is crying over the terrible mistakes.::

Duo:  Here, have a Coke.  ::Hands Tim a Coke.::

Tim:  *Sniff*  Thanks.

Mark:  We better keep him out of the theater a while...AND away from
Quatre.  ::Thinks.::  Wait, that may not be such a bad idea...

Duo:  Hey!  I have an idea!  Let's ::whispers:: get out of here...

Mark:  Good idea

Tim is trying to get out throught the air ducts and Mark is
trying the sewer system.

Tim opens the top vent and sees Quatre's minions pointing
machine guns at him.

Tim:  ::scared:: uhh....just escaping, uh, I mean, exploring...bye!

::slams vent shut::

Mark finally arrives under a manhole cover to the streets.  As
he opens it, he sees Rashid with a missile launcher.

Mark:  Oops...I guess this isn't the bathroom...I'm going back
in now...later.

::closes cover::

Duo just decides that he is going straight out the front door
only to find its locked with two vault type locks.

Duo:  DAMMIT!!!  I WANT TO GET OUTTA HERE!!!!!!!

Quatre is watching on a closed circut television and is laughing
his ass off.

Frustrated, the MSTers go back into the theatre.

>a little worried look on her.

>"And if you don’t give us the money I can use you as a ginney pig"
>Washu said with an evil grin on her face.

Duo:  (as Yosamite Sam) This is a stickup, varmint!!!

">THATS IT!!! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU GIRLS. I ACCEPTED YOU ALL TO
>LIVE IN MY HOUSE BUT THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME. BY BEATING ME !!!!"
>Nobuyuki said extremely angry.

Mark:  (as Nobuyuki) The 'beating' part, I don't mind.

">What are you gonna do about it?? Hahaha old man your only human, NOW
>GIVE US
>THE MONEY" Ryoko said, clenching her right fist together.

Tim:  I got a question...How do you 'old man your only human'?

">GET OUT NOW, LEAVE OR ELSE......" bam another punch right into
>Nobuyuki’s
>stomach. Blood came out of his mouth and nose.

Mark:  Man...whoever wrote this story must've been on acid to have
this bad of grammar.

>No please stop Ryoko’ said Mihoshi, she was crying as she held
>Nobuyuki once again.

Tim: Which part of this sentence is Mihosi talking?

>"Shut up, you stupid idiot" Ryoko said while Kyone grabbed Mihoshi.
>Then  Ryoko
>slapped Mihoshi and she fell onto the ground crying and holding her
>left cheek.

Mark:  Hot lesbo sex, alright!

>Nobuyuki looked at Ryoko with fire in his eyes and said " THATS IT.
>YOUVE HIT THE
>LAST STRAW"

Tim:  I have another question...How the hell can you hit a straw?

Duo:  Be nice to the last straw.

>"HAHAHA I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT" said Ryoko

>Nobuyuki stood up, removed his glasses and started to scream
>‘AHHHHHHHHHH’ .

Tim:  Ahhhhh...the fresh scent of pine.

>Then his eyes started to burn with fire and his hair slowly started to
>raise into the air. He

Mark:  He was too close to a lightning strike.

>started the twitch as his muscle started to grow and grow, his shirt
>ripped showing his

All:  (screaming) WHAT DID WE DO TO DESERVE THIS!!!??!!  WE DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIS LOVE STICK AGAIN!!!!!

>muscles as they where still growing. Nobuyuki’s hair stood at and end
>as it slowly started

Mark:  The author was drunk when he wrote this...I can tell.

>to turn blonde, then slowly his eyes started to turn into a blue ish
>green while his eyebrows

Duo:  What's a blue ish?  Some sort of fish?  I'm hungry.

>turned yellow,

Tim:  Someone peed on his eyebrows.

>the same hair color as his hair. He stood up strait with
>his fists at chest height.

Mark:  Uhhh....are we in the right theatre?

Duo:  Are we watching the right anime?

>At the end of his transformation, he was absolutely huge.

All:  NOOOOO!!!!!!  NOT HIS LOVE STICK!

>All the girls looked at him in fear except Ryoko and Washu.

Tim:  They were in fear of his terrible love stick.

>"Nice trick" said the calm Washu, "But you’re not doing much."

Duo:  (as Washu)  Well, look at my trick.  (pretends to pull down
pants)

Mark and Tim:  NOOO!!!!  WASHU'S A SHE-MALE!!!!

Everyone leaves to get more snacks.
***************************************************

The MSTers walk into the lobby and try to find a phone.  They're in
luck...A payphone is by the snack stand!

Mark pulls out some change and tries to dial out.

Phone:  *RINGING*

Operator:  We're sorry.  But your call cannot go through because the
greedy little bastard that's holding you hostage cut the lines!

Quatre's voice:  That's another 10 year's sentence for you!

Operator:  NO!  HAVE MERCY!

Mark:  ::Hangs up.::  I want to tell you all the news.  But you'd hurt me...

Duo:  What's up?

Mark:  Uhhhhhhhh.  The phone operator's held hostage, too...

Tim:  Great...

Quatre comes out of his office in the theater.

Quatre:  Haha!  You really think you could call for help?

All:  Yes.

Quatre:  You know escape attempts are futile, right?

All:  We know...

Quatre:  You know I'm keeping you here for all eternity, right?

All:  We'll die before that happens.

Quatre:  Your point being?...

Everyone frowns.

Quatre:  I do have a little surprise for you, though!

Tim:  We don't want to see your feces, really!

::Quatre pulls out a remote control::

Duo:  You're going to let us go, right?  This was all a big joke, right?

Quatre:  Duo, Duo, Duo...  You should know by now that if you push a nice
guy too far that he'll snap, right?

Mark:  We're doomed because of this surprise, aren't we?

Quatre:  Noooooot exactly.  ::pushes a button on the remote control::

Suddenly the whole building begins to shake.  We see outside, the theatre
starts to lift off the ground.  Not only is this building a theatre, its
a space ship.

Quatre:  I modeled this off the Sattelite of Love from my idol, Dr. Clayton
Forrester.  Well, because of copyright issues I couldn't exactly build it
like the SOL.

Mark:  You are a sick, sick man.

Quatre:  That's another 20 years.

Duo:  Question....why are you adding years to our sentence when you're keeping
us here for all eternity?

Quatre:  Uhhh....good question...I'll get back to you on that.

Everyone falls over anime style.

Quatre:  NOW GET BACK IN THE THEATRE!!!!

The MSTers pyle back into the're prison for life.

>The transformed Nobuyuki looked at Ryoko, then he grabbed her

All:  BREASTS!!!!!

>and threw her outside of the house to the large lake. Nobuyuki flew after
>as the other girls followed. "Look I gave you

Duo:  Free gigolo escort.

Tim:  Free pizza.

Mark:  ::singing::  And a partridge in a pear tree.

>a warning but now it’s too late, I’m gonna teach you all a lesson,
>and especially you Ryoko for hitting Mihoshi." As he hovered over Ryoko,
>she flew up and hit him in the

Tim:  LOVE STICK!!!!

>stomach again, but the new and extremely powerful Nobuyuki didn’t even
>move an inch.

>"WHAAAAAAAT!!" said the confused Ryoko

Duo:  (as Ryoko) I can't hear you!

>"It’s my turn!" Nobuyuki said. Then he punched Ryoko in the face. She
>flew strait into the

Tim:  Bering Strait!

>lake.

Tim:  Man!  I was close!

>He looked and turned at the other girls. He flew towards them and he grabbed
>Kyono before she was able to get her lazer gun out of her gun holder. He flew
>up around

Mark:  Who the hell is Kyono?

Tim:  Must be Royko's friend and lover.

>30 feet into the air and started to slap her hard.

All:  WOO-HOO!!!  BONDAGE!  SADOMASOCHISM!!

>He didn’t stop until she was bleeding and out cold. After a couple of hard
>slaps, she was out and he dropped her.

Duo:  DAMN!  Have all the domination to youself!  Nobuyuki's not even giving
Ryoko a turn!

Tim:  No wonder Tenchi's mom died so young...  What a waste of good woman...

>Then he started to

Mark:  Oil Ryoko up!

Duo:  Tie her to the bed!

>power up a blast , then he shot it at Aeka. The blast ripped through
>her shield and hit Aeka in the chest, she went flying into Sesami

Duo:  They went flying to Sesami Street.

>and Ryo-Ohki, she hit them out cold. "You said it was fake Washu.
>Now you can feel how fake it really is. HAHAHA"

Mark:  Not the love stick thing again!

Tim:  Maybe it's a dildo.

>"I’m not done with you yet.." said a Ryoko as she flied out of the lake
>with blood all around her.

Duo:  She never had a turn in this extremely sick sadomasochistic lemon.

>"Becareful Ryoko, He’s very powerful but you might have a chance" said
>Washu, then she thought * She’s doomed*

Tim:  Becareful, I might get sick watching this fic.

>Yosho heard all she shouting, screaming and the blasts from the shrine.

Tim:  (as Yosho)  Not the apocalypse again.

Mark:  (as Yosho)  Dammit!  Is MGPNoboyuki on the loose again?

>So he got up and ran towards the house.

Mark:  Shrine?!  House!?  MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

>He looked at Nobuyuki, laughed and said

Tim:  (as Yosho)  What the hell?!

Mark:  (as Yosho)  Another bad crossover/lemon...  Help us all...

>" Well Raditz it looks like your up to your old tricks again"

Duo:  You little rascal, you...

Tim:  A flaming bag of shit on the doorstep gets old after a while.  And we won't
stamp on it like the first time.

Mark:  I prefer egging someone's house and wrapping their trees in toilet paper.

Tim:  I prefer the whoopie cushion.

>At the battle Nobuyuki started to beat on Ryoko until she was out. He
>kept on giving her the old Jab-Punch-Jab,

Mark:  Here, take this old Jab-Punch-Jab.  I have plenty of them and need to get
rid of them.

>he kept it simple

Duo:  But Ryoko failed the math exam.

>so that Ryoko could block it, but she was too slow and he was way too powerful.
>He gave her another jab then a final uppercut to finish her off. She was out, in
>another dimension but not dead.

Duo:  It looks like FUNimation did a real poor job of editing this one.

>Then Nobuyuki pointed his finger

Tim:  ::Opens his mouth.::

Mark:  DON'T SAY IT!

Tim:  Pull my finger!

Mark:  He said it...

>at Washu an gave her a little blast that would knock her out. Yosho looked the
>girls and wondered why Nobuyuki didn’t get Mihoshi.  "Ahh I see now. It looks like

Duo:  ...she's too blond and stupid...

>he may have feelings for her" Then he turned around and walked back to his shrine.

Tim:  (as Yosho)  Whoops, too big of a fight for me.

>Nobuyuki landed on the ground and he changed back to him old self.

Duo:  Where does this guy live?  Must be the creeks of Alabama or something.

>Back into his human form, he walked towards the house and picked up his glasses.
>"Ahh come on this was my favorite shirt, but now it’s all torn up".

Mark:  (as Nobuyuki in a gay lisp)  And look at my hair!  It'th going to take monthth to
fixth thith!

>He put on his glasses and he saw Mihoshi running towards him.

>"WOW!!! That was amazing Nobuyuki, I never knew that you were one of
>those special guys.

Tim:  Nobuyuki's a Saiyajin...with a difference...

Duo:  I knew it.  Nobuyuki's secret is that he's gay.

>You know the guys that their planet got blown up by Frieza.." Mihoshi said.

Mark:  (as Mihoshi)  "You know, the guys who got their planet blown up by that
clown that sounds like a crack whore in English."

>"Ehh you mean a Sayin? Yes thats right I am a Sayin" Nobuyuki replied
>to Mihoshi

>"Does anyone know?" Mihoshi said looking confused

Duo:  ::Talking in a homosexual type of lisp.::  No, I haven't come out of the
"clothet" yet.

>"My old wife and Yosho. Look I don’t want people to know beacuse of my
>past. Hey let’s go inside and do into the hot springs pool, and relax"

Tim:  DISGUSTING!  Nobuyuki has an old wife!?!?!  Don't the sagging breasts disturb
him?

>"Hehehe ohh you, eh ok" Mishoshi said blushing

>Nobuyuki replied "Are you alright?"

>"Yeah thank you, thanks for saving me back then" Mihoshi said still
>blushing

>They walked inside and went to their rooms to get their swimming suits.
>Mihoshi got her 2 piece Bikini. It was dark blue with yellow lacing. Nobuyuki
>got his black swimming trunks. Mihoshi went into the pool while Nobuyuki went
>into the kitchen and got a special bottle of Sucke.

Tim:  What...the...hell?

Duo:  "Sucke, the drink that doesn't improve your image.  Be SUCKY!"

Mark:  "Sucke, it just plain...uhh...sucks."

>Then he ran to the pool.

Duo:  Nobuyuki slipped on the pool edge and busted his head; therefore ending this
piece of crap.

Tim:  We still have a ways to go.

Duo:  If I had Deathscythe, you'd be so dead.

>He saw Mihoshi there and he slowly walked towards the pool.

Mark:  Walk to the pool?!  Run to the pool!?  MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

>Her back was turned at the door so she didn’t know he was there.
>Nobuyuki slowly got into the pool and he put his hand on Mihoshi’s
>shoulder.

>"Ohh I didn’t hear you come in" she looked at him with a surprised face
>and said " Is that sucke?"

Tim:  You'll be sucking something REEEEEEEAAAAAAAL nasty in a minute.

>Nobuyuki said " Yes thats right, but here I see your a bit tense let me
>give you a message"

Duo:  (as Mihoshi)  A message?  But I'm right here!

>Mihoshi nodded her head. Then Nobuyuki poured 2 glasses of sucke and he
>handed one to Mihoshi. Mihoshi got up while Nobuyuki opened his legs

Mark:  JESUS!  NOT THE LOVE STICK AGAIN!

Duo:  (as Mihoshi)  Ohh!  Nobuyuki!  Am I going to use your thighs as earmuffs?

>signaling Mihoshi to sit down.  She sat down between his legs with her back
>turned at him.

Tim:  Mihoshi better watch out for her cornhole.

Duo:  The Nobuyuki enema...

>He started to message her

Mark:  DAMMIT!  SHE'S RIGHT THERE!

>shoulders

Mark:  Oh...

>"Hmmmm this feels soo good" Mihoshi looked up at the celling and she
>closed her eyes.  "So will you tell me you past story now? PLEASE?"

Tim:  Some people...sheesh...

>"Mishoshi I feel like I cant trust with anything.

Duo:  I tried trusting with a fishing rod once.

Tim:  I'm not even going to take my time and think about
what you just said...

Mark:  You just can't trust with anything!

>Ok well about 20 years ago. I came to this earth to find my brother Kakarot.
>I came here to tell him to come back or to kill him. But he was too power full

Mark:  Too power full of shit...

>for me and he had 2 power full allies, his son Gohan and a Namek named Picolo.
>I was winning until Kakarot held me back and Picolo shot at me, but at the
>last second I was able to dodge the shot. I had to fly out as fast as I
>could,

Tim:  ::Pulls out a DBZ episode guide and looks at the episode where Raditz
DIES.::  This just does not compute.  That is a DEAD RADITZ.  ::Points at a
picture of a DEAD RADITZ.::

Duo:  That's a DEAD RADITZ alright.

Mark:  Have to agree.

Tim:  Yep, that is the Makankousappou going right through him.

>while I had to lower my power so they couldn’t sence me. I realized that I wasn’t
>powerful enough, and that I had to stay low. I came here and met with a beutiful woman,
>her father Yosho knew about my powers and he helped me train. I hit SuperSayin level but
>then I stopped training because I had a newborn son.."

>"Oh oh I know, thats Tenchi right?" Mihoshi said all excited

All:  ::Sarcastically.::  NO!?!?!?!?!?

>"Yes thats right Mihoshi, well you know the rest of the story. My wife
>died and I had to raise Tenchi myself" Nobuyuki said sounding a bit sad "
>I never thought that would meet any one as beutyful as my wife, but then you
>came into my life Mihoshi"

Mark:  Yep...he's a redneck alright.  BEUtyful!

>"You mean me?

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  NO, the OTHER Mihoshi.  OF COURSE YOU, RETARD!

>You have had feeling for me all this time? Why didn’t you tell me
>anything?" Mihoshi said all confused.

>"Well I always thought that you loved Tenchi like the other girls" he
>replied

>"HA?!

Tim:  That was funny.  Ha?!  Ha?!

>I dont love Tenchi, I love

Mark:  My Chia Pet.

>you" Mihoshi said while she turned around and sat on his right lap. She
>looked at Nobuyuki shile a tear ran down her eyes.

Duo:  And now, the Tour De Mihoshi's Eyes.  Watch a single tear run down both
Mihoshi's eyes, something that just isn't plain right.

>"I love you Mihoshi and I have from the first day I saw you"  Nobuyuki
>said while he looked into those beutyfull blue eyes.

>Nobuyuki and Mihoshi drew their head towards each other.

Mark:  This makes absolutely no sense.  What are they?  A Siamese twin joined
at the head or something?!  One head cannot belong to two people!

>They lips meet in a passionate kiss.

>They felt like it lastest for eternity.

Tim:  ::In a child's voice.::  It wastest fowevuh and evuh!

>Mihoshi slowly put her tongue into Nobuyuki mouth, he returned the favor.
>Mihoshi broke up the kiss and said " I love you, but this is my first
>time, please be gentile" "Don’t worry my love, you will never be hurt around me"

Tim:  Uh-huh.  What about Ryoko?  He wasn't that way with her!

>Mihoshi knelt down on his lap so she can face him and be close. She got
>close enough to feel his hard cock about to rip out of his trunks.

Duo:  I have had ENOUGH with Nobuyuki's schlong!

Tim:  I will never make another slang reference to the penis again in everday
conversation if we get out of here alive.  Quatre has ruined my manly pride.

>Nobuyuki had a giant smile on his face as he felt her pussy in her bikini

Mark:  How can one of those be in her bikini!?  Guys, if you will excuse
me, I'm going to vomit.  I shall never think about breasts in the same way
again.

>rubbing agains his hard dick. She put he hands behind her back and she started to
>unravel her bikini, she took off her top and reveled her beutyfull
>light tanned brests with pink nipples.

Duo:  And a pussy.

Mark:  ::Throws up.::

>They are perfectly sized, every mans dream, perfectly round, and her tan was amazing,
>you can see little triangles around her breasts. You can see all her tan lines.
>Nobuyuki couldn’t belive what was inches from his face. His eyes widened in shock.

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  THERE'S A PUSSY THERE!

>"Is there something wrong?" Mihoshi said looking worried, " Is there
>something wrong with my figure?"

Tim (as Nobuyuki again)  Uhh, yeah.  There's a pussy on your chest.

>"No, no, no, Your amazing Mihoshi, your even beutifuller than my last
>wife, Im just so amazed at how beutifull you are"

Mark:  This grammar sucks so bad I can't say anything about it.

>Mihoshi looked at Nobuyuki and she had an amazing smile on her face.
>They shared in another passionate kiss. Nobuyuki put his hands on Mihoshis
>breast and he started to message them.

Mark:  How you can message breasts?  They are a part of Mihoshi who is THERE!

>He moved his left hand up higher at Mihoshis neck. He broke

Tim:  Mihoshi's neck.

>up the kiss and he started to kiss down the left side of her neck. He went lower
>and lower until he got in between the valley between her breats.

All:  OH GROSS!  HE'S EAING OUT THE PUSSY ON HER CHEST!

>He gave little kisses and started to kiss her right  breast while he messaged her
>left breast with his right hand. He lowered his left and he grabbed Mihoshis ass,
>and he started to message it.

Mark:  Get a pager service or something!  SHE'S RIGHT THERE!

>He was kissing and liking her nipple, they thought that they were in totaly extacy,
>but the best was just about to come.

Duo:  I never knew a man who liked nipples as much as this guy...

>"Hmmmm this is too good, but I think its time"

Tim:  To stop this lemon.

>Mishoshi said, she got up of Nobuyuki’s lap. She turns over as she bent over. Her gorgeus
>ass was inches next to his face. Then she slowly lower the lower part of her bikini. She
>lowered it so slowly that Nobuyuki was gonna go mad,

Mark:  Hit the dirt!  Nobuyuki's going to go postal!

>his cock just raising again, becomming the biggest he has ever had. She slowly revelead
>her asshole.

Duo:  ::as Adam Sandler.::  I looked up Mihoshi's asshole today!  It blew my fucking mind!

>She bent over even lower, her head was nearly in the water, then

Tim:  She drowned.  The End.

>she stepped out of the thong part and threw it aside.

Mark:  ::as a cop through a megaphone::  Step out of the thong now!

>Nobuyuki took of his trunks as fast as he could. He took them off then
>Mihoshi looked at him , and nodded. "I’m ready"

Duo:  ...to be in such great pain...

>she said

>She slowly lowered herself on Nobuyuki monster dick.

Duo:  The horror, the horror...

>She had seen a dick before but only in those love comics and she never thought that Nobuyukis
>would be soo big. His dick was slowly going into Mihoshis cunt,

Tim:  Is it the one on her chest?  Gives a whole new meaning to titty screwing, doesn't it?

Mark:  ::PUKE!::

>as she lowed, she moaned " HMMMMM" then Nobuyuki felt Mihoshis barrier.

Mark:  It's just like that electric underwear on "Scary Movie", isn't it?

Tim:  (as Mihoshi)  Oh, Nobuyuki.  I forgot to tell you I cast a barrier spell on my pussy.

>He put his hands on her hips, and he brought his waist upwards . With
>Mihoshis help he pushed her downwards onto his dick, while he ripped the barrier, and
>pushed his cock further and further into Mihoshis beutifull pussy.

>"Ouch, that hurts" She yelled , but she was starting to enjoy it " In
>and out . In and out, OHHHHHH"

Duo:  AH!  HURT ME MORE!

>*Geez its been nearly 20 years that I have had sex with a woman*
>Nobuyuki was thinking. "I can’t belive this Mihoshi, I LOVE YOU" He screamed

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  OH KRISTIE!

Duo:  (as Mihoshi)  Who's Kristie?

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki) Just an old flame...  I'll stop fantasizing about them if you want.

>Mihoshi started to bounce up and down on his dick, and Nobuyuki felt
>her ass until he saw Mihoshis breats starting to bounce up and down. He grabbed
>her breasts and started to message them again...  "OHHHH MY GOD" Mihoshi screamed with
>pleasure nearly getting to her climax.

>"I’m hitting my climax" Nobuyuki said while looking at Mihoshis face.

>Mihoshi grabbed his hands of her breasts and she started to squeeze
>them, he under stood that she was reaching her climax by squeezing back. She closed her eyes
>and tightened her face muscles. They both yelled at the same time while Nobuyuki cummed
>into Mihoshis pussy.

>"Ahhhhh" he said in relif.

All:  Aaaahhhhhl-legra.

>Mihoshi stayed on his dick, but she layed her head on Nobuyuki
>shoulder. While they were both gasping for air.

>They rested for about 30 minutes.Nobuyuki looked into Mihoshis
>beutyfull blue eyes. She had 2 tears on either side of her face. One for
>the pain and one for her new love.

>Nobuyoki got up and sat at the edge of the hot springs pool. He opened
>his legs. With a few flicks of his wrist he go his dick hard again. Mihoshi
>understood what happened , she nodded and lowered her head on Nobuyukis dick.

>She kissed the tip of his dick. Then she opened her mouth and started to put
>his dick into her mouth. She sucked

Tim:  This whole fic sucks.

>fast and slow. She sometimes even took it out of her mouth to lick the tip.
>Nobuyuki was in total extacy, he laid back and looked at the celling.
>While Mihoshi sucked faster and faster and faster. He couldn’t take it anymore, he
>was gonna explode. He cummed right into Mihoshis mouths.

Mark:  Is Mihoshi a mutated freak or something?  First we see Siamese twins
and now this!

>She was shocked and didn’t know what to do so she swallowed it and started to lick
>it off his tip.

>"AHHH that was too good Mihoshi"

>She looked up and smiled with joy " Thank you very much"

>"Its time to swtich"

Duo:  ...sexes!...

Mark:  To Diet Coke.

>he said. but Mihoshi was kind of confused.

>She sat up on the egde while Nobuyuki went into the water. He slowly
>opened her legs reviling her beutifull pussy. He slowly opened her pussy lips
>with his fingers and he opened them. He slowly lowered his head, and he put his
>tongue into her clit. He started to lick faster and slower.

Mark:  FASTER!?  SLOWER!?  MAKE...

Tim:  That's enough...

>Mihoshi grabbed the back of his head and arched her back trying to get his entire tongue
>into her clit.  Nobuyki liked faster and faster. Mihoshi shut her eyes shut and screamed
>in happyness.

>She reached her climax and started to scream.
>"AHHHHHHH- OHHH-UHHHH-MMMMMMMMM"

Tim:  ::Chanting.::  Ohhhhmmmm...Ohhhhmmmm...Ohhhhmmmm...Ohhhhmmmm...

>Then she started cummin right into his mouth.

Duo:  The Injuns are cummin!

>"MMMM this tastes soo good" He said with a mouth full of Mihoshis
>semen.

Tim:  Mihoshi's a she-male, too!

Duo and Mark:  AUGH!

>"It’s sooo thick. It’s soooo white.

Mark:  Behold the power of cheese!  Melted Mozzerella, in particular.

Duo:  Speaking of cheese, anyone hungry for pizza?

Tim:  I LIKE CHEESE!

Duo:  ::Mallets Tim on the head.::

>"It’s sooo salty"

Mark:  (as Nobuyuki)  These pretzels were a little overdone on the salt.

>he just loved Mihoshis flavor.

Duo:  Now buy these potato chips in new and improved Mihoshi flavor!

Tim:  Don't forget to buy our product in these new flavors:  Kiyone, Ryoko,
Aeka, "Sesami seed", and ALL NEW SAKUYA!

>It was truly a taste of Heaven,

Tim:  Yep, Philadelphia Cream Cheese DOES taste like heaven, just like it said
on the commercials.

>maybe even better.

Mark:  I know what could be maybe even better...THIS FIC!

>"Hmmm There is only one more position I cant think of Mihoshi" Nobuyuki
>said with a delight look on his face.

Duo:  There isn't one more position I can't not think of!

>Mihoshi looked at him and nodded " Yes I understand, this one might be
>even more fun then the others"

Mark:  If Nobuyuki can't think of another postion, why is this lemon
continuing?

Duo:  Hell if I know.

>Nobuyuki saved some of Mihoshis cum

Tim:  And had it as a midnight snack.

Duo:  Mihoshi's "semen" isn't really nutritious.

Tim:  How do you know?  Have you starred in a yaoi fic or something?

Duo:  NO!  I read it in a medical book.

Tim:  YAOI BOY!

Duo  Am not!

Tim:  Are too!

Mark:  SHUT UP!  ::Mallets both of them.::

>as he scooped it into his right hand. He turned her around and

Mark:  Splattered it in her face like a pie.

Duo:  Ugh.  Let's hope she doesn't lick it off Scooby-Doo style.

>started to lubricate her asshole.

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  Here, Mihoshi.  This should solve all your
constipation and hemherrhoid problems.

>"Now Mihoshi, you must understand that you have to relax in this
>position. If you don’t then you will hurt your self and me" Nobuyuki
>said calmly.

>"Ok" Mihoshi said with excitement.

Mark:  (as Mihoshi)  What?  Did you say tighten my asshole during the
process?

>He lowered her into the hot spring water once again until she was ready
>to kneel down in the inside step that people sit on in the pool. She knelt
>down as the water was up to the bottom part of her breasts. Nobuyuki got one
>last feel of Mihoshi breasts

Duo:  Then he died a happy man.

Tim:  I think Tenchi's mother would be 70 lifetimes of dying a happy man!

Mark:  (as a baseball stadium food salesman)  Hurry!  Hurry!  Get your last
feel of Mihoshi breasts!  Feel them while they're hot!

>and he felt her hard nipples that he adored so much.

Tim:  I guess he'll "like" her nipples some more, huh?

>Mihoshi straightened her arms, and put her hand on the ledge knowing that this
>might hurt more than before, but she was even readier than before. Nobuyuki took
>his right hand and put it on his erected hard cock. Then he guided it into Mihoshis
>asshole.

Duo:  Our new guided dick technology features hands.  It has 100% accuracy
on hitting assholes on target!

Mark:  I bet Nobuyuki wishes it was a man right now, huh?  He IS gay after all.

>Slowly inch by inch he went deeper into her,

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  Mihoshi.  You don't mind if I move you internal organs
aside?  I want to see how far I can get into you,  You know, climbing in your
asshole and all.

>until her got in 3 quatres of the way.

::Everyone looks slowly to the projection booth.::

Duo:  ::Toward the projection booth.::  Were you born in a group of triplets?
I guess Quatre and his trio group started Nobuyuki's desire!

Quatre:  I was considering parole for you.  But now I've changed my mind.

Mark:  DAMN YOU TO HELL!  ::Picks up a theater seat and bludgeons Duo.::

Tim:  Until "her got in"?  This fic is full of she-males.  First Nobuyuki's
love stick, now this!

>"Thank you for relaxing Mihoshi" he looked at her while her eyes were
>shut close , with a wide grin on her face.  After a minute. Nobuyuki felt

Duo:  Like a man...

>her asshole was as loose as her pussy , then he started to take thrusts into
>Mihoshi. She yelled with please and pain.

Duo:  PLEASE!  PAIN!  More hot sex, please!

Tim:  Please!  More pain...TO THE YAOI BOY!  You're enjoying the anal sex scene,
huh?

::Mark pulls out the mallet again, effctively making Duo and Tim shut up.::

>But she said "Ohh DEEPER, DEEPER NOBUYUKI DEEPER"

Tim:  (as Nobuyuki)  If I go any farther, my toes'll stick out your eye sockets.
I have dove as far into your asshole as possible.

>He understood that he had to fuck her harder and harder, deeper and deeper.

Mark:  Mihoshi's gonna pop at this rate, Tim.

Tim:  Damn.  The toenails are digging into her brain already.

>He was

Duo:  GAY!

>grabbing Mihoshis tits while they where boucning up and down. You can
>hear Mihoshis butt checks slap against Nobuyukis thighs.

>SMACK SMACK SMACK SMACK - YELL- SCREAM

Tim:  SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT -YELL- MURDER - DIAL 911

Mark:  RIBBIT RIBBIT RIBBIT -SLURP-  EAT FLY

Duo:  TALK TALK TALK -GET SENTENCED TO LONGER TERM-  HAVE OTHERS HATE ME FOR IT

::They all nod.::

All:  ::Imitaing cow.::  MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

>They both reached their climax and cummed at the same time.
>Nobuyuki sat on the inside step while Mihoshi sat on his lap.

>"I love you Mihoshi, I always want to be with you Mihoshi" He said as
>he looked into her deep blue ocean eyes

>"Are you saying what I think your saying?" she said

Mark:  (as Mihoshi)  We're gonna break up, aren't we?

>"YES MIHOSHI MARRY ME, BE WITH ME FOR EVER!" he yelled

>"YES I WILL" as she looked at him with tears comming from both their
>faces.

>Then they shared in a final passionate kiss.

Mark:  I thought porn flicks ended with more senseless sex or someone
dying or something...

>THE END???

All:  WE HOPE SO!!!!!!

>for now

All:  NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

Duo:  (as Barney in "The Simpsons")  ::BURRRRRRRRPP!::

*******************************************************************

::Duo is holding a bottle of a particular drink as seen in the fic.::

Tim:  Hey!  Whatcha got there, Duo?

Duo:  Oh, nothing really.  Just a nice bottle of SUCKE!

Tim:  Can I have some SUCKE, too?  I want my image and ego to go down!

Mark:  Man!  SUCKE really sucks!

Tim:  I gained 250 pounds and cry all the time because of low self-esteem!
Thanks SUCKE!

Mark:  I suffered 20 heart attacks in less than a week and ran my medical
bills up to far more than I'll ever be worth in 99 lifetimes.  Thanks SUCKE!

Duo:  I got my friends trapped up here and will probably lose all my blood
in the violent beatings they give me!  Thanks SUCKE!

Mark:  AAARRRRRRGH!  You've been drinking this the whole time?

Duo:  Yes!

Tim:  Probably why he's in all those crappy yaoi fics.  We'll have to get AIDS
tests because we've drawn blood hitting him.

Mark:  ::Sweat drop, anime style.::  Aaaaaanyways, let's give Duo the blind taste
test.  Duo will have to dress up in an astronaut suit.

Duo:  ::Confused::  huh?

Mark:  To keep your vomit from getting on your clothes.

Duo:  Good point.  ::Puts the space suit on::

Tim:  Now go into the booth and put your helmet on!

Duo:  How am I going to drink anything with that thing on?

Mark:  Ahhh....we'll worry about that later.  ::Shoves Duo into the airlock and hits
the button.::

::Duo flies out into space.  But he's alive (for all you Duo fans).::

Mark and Tim:  SUCKE!  It JUST PLAIN SUCKS!

::Tim breaks the bottle.::
