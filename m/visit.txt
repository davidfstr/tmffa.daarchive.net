The Operative visits.....

Let's see if you can guess who!


The Operative walked into the building and stepped into the crowded elevator, remaining 
silent and speaking to no one. When the elevator stopped at the appropriate floor he got 
off and walked up to the young woman sitting behind the reception desk.

"Is ..."
"Yeah, he's in." She sounded bored. She sneezed.
"When..."
"Soon. Have a seat." She sneezed again. "Do you have a pet?"
"Why?"
"You're making me sneeze." She did it again.
"Sorry about that. No I don't have a pet."
She sneezed a lot more times. "Wow! Either you're lying about not having a pet or you've 
got fur."
"I um.. work in a pet store." He lied. 
"Oh... well, you'll have to quit working there if you're going to come here. Okay?"

The man the Operative had come to see walked into the room. He was of medium height and 
had no hair on top of his head, though the hair around his ears and on the back of his 
head was still mostly dark. The Operative put him at his late fourties or early fifties. 

"Naoki?" The man asked with an air of pretended self-confidence that shouted "My marriage 
was a failure! I cannot control my own son! Life just washes over me! But because I was 
stupid enough to take this job, I have to pretend that my life is just peachy keen while 
I listen to you bitch about the fact that your pet hates you because he peed on the 
sofa."  It didn't actually shout all that of course, but that was the general feeling it 
managed to convey.

The Operative nodded.

"Why don't you come in and take a seat?" The man offered as he lead the Operative into 
his office...
