Flashbulbs strobed all around Emperor Azusa as the Palace Press Corps
mobbed the podium, thrusting microphones forward.

"Can you make a statement, Your Highness?"

"Is there any truth to the rumors?"

"Do you have any comments for us?"

"We've heard that Marshall Kuramitsu has received the Science Academy
report on the stained dress. What do you have to say about that?"

"How do Empress Funaho and Crown Prince Yosho feel about this?"

Emperor Azusa waved his hands for quiet. "I have the greatest confidence
that the Council will clear me of any wrongdoing so that I can go back to
handling the business of the people of Jurai."

"But what about the allegations about Miss Misaki?" demanded one of the
journalists.

"For the last time, I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss
Misaki!" insisted the Emperor.

"That's not what she said in her testimony this afternoon!" shouted
someone.

An enormous sweatdrop appeared on the Emperor's head. "Testimony???"

"She swore under oath that she had numerous laisons with you in the throne
room, Your Majesty."

"Do you have any comments, Your Highness?"

"Isn't even the Emperor subject to Juraian law?"

Emperor Azusa waved his hands for silence again. "This is all part of a
vast conspiracy by the nobility against me. And anyway, even if it did
happen, it wouldn't be adultery and so it wouldn't be illegal."

"How can that be?!"

"What do you mean?"

"That's impossible!"

"As part of, ummm, a carefully-considered policy change formed over the
past few months, I'm issuing a retroactive decree," said Azusa. "As of
last year, each and every Emperor, starting with myself, will have to
marry two women. One from Jurai, and one from some other planet. And as
Empress Funaho is from Earth and Miss Misaki is from Jurai..."

<Happosai runs away as fast as his little legs will carry him...>

Hasheen!
