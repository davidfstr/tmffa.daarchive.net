No need to sue me. I don't own these characters and didn't make any

Mihoshi's Feelings
By, Clayton Overstreet

  Watching Ryoko and Tenchi together cut through Mihoshi like a
knife. She was happy for Ryoko. After all the space pirate had
nothing else in her life. She had been in love with Tenchi for eighteen
years. But it still hurt. Mihoshi knew she loved Tenchi. The others
thought it was just a crush. Maybe it was. She realy didn't care if they
were right. Since he had saved her that day she had been totaly in
love with him.
  She had said she was happy when Yosho pushed Ayeaka at him.
She had smiled and congradulated Ryoko and Tenchi when they
announced that he loved her. Had even accepted it when Tenchi had
told the others that they were family. But it had hurt so much.
  Alot of people thought she was a burnt out cop. Even Kagato had
said as much. Maybe they were right about that too. She couldn't tell
any more. Sitting back she felt a bit dizzy. Rubbing her head she
closed her eyes and went to sleep. Her final thoughts befor she went
uncosious were: Atleast Tenchi is happy, and I'll never leave him...
