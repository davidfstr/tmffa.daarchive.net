"Children, there will be a parent-teacher's meeting this Friday.  So please
remember to tell your mothers and fathers about it."  A gentle-looking old
woman announced in front of the whole class.  A little ruckus ensued, with
some of the children saying 'Yes, teacher' while others kept chatting among
themselves, completely ignoring the hapless woman.  She was about to leave
the room when she noticed a raised hand from a girl sitting nearby the
windows.  "Yes, Mayuka.  What is your question?"

"Teacher, how many mothers do I have to bring?"  Everyone fell silent, all
turned their heads towards the bearer of the question.  "What are you
staring at?"

The teacher blinked, checking her ears before asking, "did you say,
mothers?"

"Yes, teacher."  Mayuka stood up, raising both arms up in an attempt to look
as innocent as always.  " I don't really have a true mother, but I have
several aunts that...well, they are my mothers...so...," She looked around,
raising an eyebrow or two, "I was wondering if I could bring all my aunts on
Friday with my father."  Every kid near her blinked, and so did her confused
teacher.  "Well?"

"Um, why don't you bring your favorite aunt then."  Was her teacher's reply.
Somehow, the suggestion made Mayuka frown.

"Uh uh...I'm not getting my aunts into a quarrel again," was Mayuka's
vehement reaction.  "You just don't know how much that could get me into a
lot of trouble."

"Bring everyone then."  Her teacher was so unsure in her response, but what
else could she have said.

"Thank you, teacher.  You just don't know how much that means to me."
Mayuka sat back in her seat, pulled up her bag and dug inside for something.
She pulled out her cell phone and dialed home.  "Auntie?  Oh, Grandpa.  Are
they still yelling at each other? No?  Good, please tell all of them that my
teacher is allowing me to bring everyone."  Several nosy kids eavesdropped.
"Yes, it is great news.  Tell them that I'm happy that they are all coming
too.  And, please tell father that I'll be expecting him later when he
fetches for me from here in school."

Rumors started spreading around the room.

"He won't make it?  Why?  Really?!"  An excited tone came from Mayuka's
voice.  "Auntie Funaho and Auntie Misaki are already there?  I can't wait to
get home and meet them again."

The buzz was, 'Two more Aunts?' as the crowd still gathered around Mayuka.

"So who's going to pick me up later, Grandpa?"  Mayuka turned her head,
looking curiously at her classmates, "Auntie Tsunami is going to pick me
up?"  She smiled in response, "That's great!  I love Auntie Sasami, she's my
favorite."

Again, 'Sasami? I thought it was Tsunami?' was the word spreading around the
room.  It even reached the puzzled teacher, who suddenly found no reason to
leave for her next class.

"But don't tell Auntie Ryoko, or Auntie Ayeka...you know those two."  Mayuka
giggled for reasons unclear to everyone else in the room.  "I'll see you
later, Grandpa.  And please say to everyone that I love them.  I love them
all."  Mayuka pushed a button to end the conversation.  She took a look
around, "What?  I just have a big family, that's all."  She picked up her
things, walked past her teacher giggling, and was the first to leave the
room.
