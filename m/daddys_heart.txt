"Daddy's Heart"

It was about dusk in the hills of Okayama, Japan.  In an ever-expanding
three-story house by a lake,
 Ryoko Hakubi sat in the nursery room of one special little girl with
silvery-black hair that almost
looked colbolt blue.  The infant girl who's hair seemed to tuft out like
horns on top of her head, slept
softly in the former spece-pirate's imbrace.   Demon-summoner and demon
daughter. Ryoko
couldn't remember when she felt more content, she reflected as she sat in
one of the nursery
rockers moving gently in time with the lullaby that she hummed to herself
and the sleeping baby.
She had heard Washu sing it once, and being that Washu was technically
Ryoko's mother, Ryoko
felt it somehow...fitting.  She smiled to herself with the warm thoughts
that  the lullaby brought her,
watching the last rays of the sun shine it's rainbow colors through the room
and across the infant
girl's sleeping form.  ; She wasn't startled when a shadow suddenly appeared
across the floor,
originating from the doorway, and in fact, offered the child up to the form
standing above her.

"Careful not to wake her, Tenchi.  I just got that kiddo to sleep."  Ryoko
carefully tucked the pink
fleecy baby blanket into Tenchi's arms as he took the child.

"Ryoko.  Sorry I'm late...I know it's my turn to take care of Mayuka.
Practice with grandpa ran a
little late, a ha haa..."  Tenchi Masaki began to nervously chuckle, lifting
one of his arms as though to
scratch his neck, thought he weight of the baby prevented him from doing so.

"No need to be sorry, Tenchi.  Just don't keep her up tonight, or there'll
be hell to pay."  Ryoko
smiled back at him breifly before standing to go.

"Ryoko, thank you for helping out with Mayuka and all."
"Hey, no problem, right?  After all, I *am* her personal trainer."  Ryoko
punched into her hand to
accentuate her point.

Tenchi nodded in agreement, before settling down into the rocking chair just
next to the one Ryoko
had been occupying.  For a moment as he adjusted himself with Mayuka in his
arms he seemed
almost sorrowful and what Ryoko could detect as just a bit scared.  Ryoko,
never having departed
as she palnned, still stood poised in her spot, not sure whether to go or
stay, and finally phased back
into her chair next to Tenchi.

"Tenchi?"  Ryoko asked.

"Ryoko, have you ever wished...Have you done something in your past,
something that you know
that you did wrong, and you didn't get a chance to fix it?  And you wished
that you had?"

"Tenchi, what are you talking about?  You're not usually talkative like
this.  And you *never* talk to
me, Tenchi, so what is it you're saying?"

"I'm talking about Mayuka..."  Tenchi was almost whispering.  His sad tone
was apparent as his
chocolate brown eyes gazed down lovingly at the infant, her tiny face
scrunching up into a frown as
she yawned in her sleep.  Tenchi smiled slightly.

"She did love you, you know.  She loves you now.  She knows that you love
her."
"That's not exactly what I mean."
"Then what?"  Ryoko asked.
"I mean...I know it's not my fault, you know?  And she's so small now, so
fragile.  She depends on
us,  you know." Ryoko stiffened at Tenchi's words, *she depends on us,* she
thought to herself.
*US!*  Tenchi and I...  Tenchi continued to struggle at finding the words,
looking down at the tiny
sleeping form.  "It was just six...no, seven months ago that she came to us,
and it was only for that
day.  I'm--I'm a *father*, Ryoko.  I can't get over that enough.  I'm not
even nineteen and I'm a
*father*."
"Lots of guys are fathers at your age, Tenchi.  Why in America I hear--"
"--And her mother..."
"Yuzuha?"
"She had to go and kill her, her best part.  If it wasn't for Little
Washu--"  Tenchi's face was
scrun ching up in anger, but still Ryoko could tell that Tenchi wasn't
exactly getting to the point as
fast as she would have like.  She loved Tenchi, would die for him, but
sometimes she could just about
 kill him to make him get to the point.  But she'd be crazy not to stick it
out now, listening to Tenchi
when he really seemed to need her.  He could be talking to anyone else right
now.  Kiyone would
understand.  She was the practical type.  Or his grandfather, or even Washu
herself...there were
seven other people in this house alone to talk to, and even one fuzzy little
cabbit who would love to
lend an ear.  And here she was...  "--She would have been lost to us,
forever, Ryoko."

"What is it that you regret, Tenchi?"
"I regret...I regret not having known.  Or not having believed.  When
I--When I slapped you,
Ryoko--"
"That's been long forgiven, Tenchi."
"--After I had slapped you I had told her that I didn't believe that she was
my daughter, that it was
just a fantasy.  And I had already had the proof.  I don't know if she knew
it, but I had the *proof*,
Ryoko.  And I denied it!  Denied that my blood didn't run through her veins
just like my dad's runs
through mine."  Or Washu's through mine, Ryoko thought to herself.

"You shouldn't blame yourself.  I mean, the way she just *showed up* that
day calling you
'Daddy'..."  Ryoko let out an almost subconscious growl.
"I suppose you're right.  But I suppose the worst part is that I think that
I knew.  Deep down inside,
I knew, and I don't know if she ever knew that.  I felt a *connection* with
her, Ryoko, as if she
*was* mine.  Just like the connection --"  Ryoko held her breath for the
answer, hoping, somehow,
that he felt the connection with her on some level , like soul mates, or at
the very least, that he even
felt the connection with Princess Ayeka, and that's why he'd never choose
her.  Earthlings don't
 marry their great aunts...  "--between Little Washu and yourself.  At
least, from what Washu's
explained."  Tenchi finished.

"So, you loved her then, Tenchi?"  Ryoko was almost a bit jealous, memories
coming back to her of
a "possessed" Mayuka, a teenager being controlled by the Demoness of
Darkness, Yuzuha,
attempting to seduce Tenchi more times than Ryoko cared to remember.
"I'm not sure.  I think, I think if I had known, or if the circumstances
were different, I could have
loved her, we could have all loved her.  She was so sweet and innocent
but...SHE MANIPULATED
 HER!  She tried to *seduce* me.  That DAMN Yuzuha!"  Tenchi shot out, a
little too loudly
because just then baby Mayuka, who had been resting peacefully in her
daddy's arms let out a
perfectly-timed wail.
"Well now, Tenchi, you're going to have to pay."  Ryoko said in mock anger.
"Give her here.  We'll
figure out the punishment later."  She shot up a toothy grin to Tenchi as he
handed the baby over to
her, and gazed at him seductively wit h shinning amber eyes before settling
back into the chair.  "Isn't
that right, Mai?"  She cooed the baby Mayuka and sleepy orange orbs opened
to gaze at Ryoko
before once again fluttering closed.

"Ruining such an innocent girl like that..."  Tenchi muttered, oblivious to
the implications.
"Really, Tenchi, you mean it?"  Ryoko said, obviously thinking of Tenchi
taking *her* innocence.
"Ryoko!  I mean Yuzuha and Mai!"  He hissed from between his teeth.  "She
ruined her and
pumped her full of false memories and *controlled* her and false..."
"Her love for you was real, Tenchi.  I know that much for a fact."
"I hope you're right.  It doesn't much matter now.  Washu promised to
restore her memories when
the time is right, all of them. I'm sure there'll be some sort of therapy
involved, too.  She'll never be
that same Mayuka, though."
"She'll be better for it, Tenchi.  How many times do I have to tell you
this?"
"Thank you, Ryoko."

"Tenchiii!  Dinner-ooh."  Sasami said, running through the hall and having
come to a full stop in the
doorway, just as Ryoko was laying Mayuka back in her crib.  "Tenchi, Ryoko!
There you are!"
Sasami lowered her voice, "Dinner is ready, I made your favorite tempura,
Tenchi!"
"We'll be down in a minute, Sasami.  Thank you for getting us."  Tenchi
said.

"Tenchi, just remember that you're going to be a *great* parent,"  Ryoko
beamed a big smile at
Tenchi from her spot at Mayuka's crib.  "You already are."
"Thank you, Ryoko.  You too."  Ryoko thought she had her right, but at the
moment that Tenchi
spoke those words, she was already phasing away, her destination the dinner
table.

"Goodnight, my sweet angel.  Daddy loves  you very much."  Tenchi took one
last look in the
direction of the crib before closing the nursery door and heading for
dinner.

Owari.  Or is it?

AUTHOR'S NOTE:  Well, just like every Tenchi series/movie, there were just a
few things *wrong*
with Daughter of Darkness. And by "wrong", I mean incestual.  But this time
none of it was on
purpose.  And in their universe, the Tenchi crew *do* have real feelings,
emotions, and
understanding of consequences.  I just decided to play around with this a
bit, and I don't know if I got
the point accross that I wanted to, but please let me know.  Flames and
