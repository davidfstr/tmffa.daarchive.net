Disclaimer, brought to you by Carl: We don't own Vegeta from Dragon Ball Z 
or any of the fanfic/MST characters, meaning you cant sue us for saying we 
do cause we didn't.  But if you do, may I remind you, Vegeta has some pretty 
powerfull attacks.
Vegeta: Hey Carl, don't get me involved in this!
Carl: Sorry, oh yeah, we still haven't fixed the censor yet



* Carl is sitting in his room, reading a book *
Carl: How did Katy trick me into reading this Redwall crap anyway? * looks 
out the window * Oh... My... God...
Vegeta * Still asleep *: Must... Do... Stupid... Long... Sentances...
Carl: Ugh, MSTing fics is affecting everyone around here! *Tries to wake up 
Vegeta *
Vegeta: Huh, what? AW CRAP ITS YOU! GALLIC GUN! * Vegeta fires a Gallic gun 
blast at Carl *
Carl: No need to get angry! But there's something out the window you should 
look at
Vegeta * looking out window *: Oh my god! Washu's sending us into a black 
hole!
Washu * over intercom *: No you moron! It's a wormhole
Carl: So we're heading towards either a trans-galactical or trans-dimensinal 
portal?
Washu: Go back to sleep, you have an MST tommorow.

* Morning (or something like that in space), in Katy and Libby's room *

Katy * Waking up *: Ugh, I have a headache! * Looks out the window, and 
notices the ship is escaping the pull of a wormhole.  She then puts a hand 
on the back of her head * Huh? Why is my head damp? * Looks in mirror, then 
screams * OH MY FUCKING GOD!
* Carl bursts in *
Carl: What's go... COOL! You're an anime character
Katy: Oh god, the Wart's gone anime too!
Carl: Really? * Looks out window, and sees that instead of going into the 
wormhole, they are flying away from it * Oh, I see now!
Katy: I always knew you were blind as well as stupid.
Carl: No! I mean that we went through a trans-dimensional wormhole that 
instantaneously transported up us to the dimension of all anime.
Katy: In English Wart?
Carl: The wormhole made us come to the anime universe!
Katy: oh...

* A while later, everyone has woken up, got dressed, and is sitting around a 
coffee table in the main room, talking and drinking coffee *

Katy: So, Washu, remind me of why we're in the anime universe?
Washu: That's LITTLE Washu!
Katy: Sorry! So, LITTLE Washu, remind me of why we're in the anime universe?
Washu: I like this place better.
Katy: So why are we anime characters again?
Washu: Because people in this dimension aren't used to seeing you "real" 
people, and now you can facefault.
Libby: What's facefault?
* Vegeta, Carl, And Katy facefault *
Libby: Oh, I get it now!
The Voice: doom! Doom! DOOM!
Vegeta: sounds like a lemon to me!
Washu: Got it in one, you're doing both parts of "Tenchi Go Boom"
Carl: Cool! Spontaneous combustion!
  * Carl, Libby and Vegeta stand up, Katy stays put *
Katy: No! Its too early I wanna go to back to bed!
* Libby pulls her out of her seat *
Libby: Move it Blondie!
Katy: K, but you gonna pay for this!
* Katy sulkily walks into the theater *

================================================================================

It was a late Saturday afternoon in mid-March. Tenchi had come home from
his swordsmanship training with his grandfather.

Vegeta: CARL? DID YOU DELETE THE DISCLAIMER AGAIN?
Carl: Hey! Washu controls the fics we watch. Washu? Did you delete the 
disclaimer?
Washu: No! * Throws a mobile phone that is auto dialling Pioneer *
Carl: How can it dial Pioneer from a different universe?
Washu: Contrary to popular belief, Pioneer and other anime companies 
actually send the anime series' in capsules through wormholes like the one 
we came through to distributors.
Carl * Head shaking violently *: I get it * picks up phone *
Voice on phone: Hello, Pioneer offices on the Tenchi Fanfiction version of 
Earth, how may we help you?
Carl: There's no disclaimer on the lemon fanfic titled "Tenchi Go Boom"
Voice on phone: Cool! * Sound of shotgun being loaded * I haven't murdered 
an author in AGES!  I really need to let out some stress... * Sound of 
Samurai sword being taken out of holster, then sharpened *
Carl * to Washu *: I thought authors are sued, not murdered!

Grandfather: Tenchi, after you change your clothes do us a favor and buy
some groceries.
Tenchi: Sure, Grandpa.
Tenchi went into his room and began to change out of his sweaty clothes.
When he was just about done he saw Ryoko flying toward him and giving him
one of those usual embraces strong enough to strangle a bull.

Carl: I'll tell ya what strangle this fic.
Vegeta: Yeah this fic is bull
Katy and Libby: SHIT!

Ryoko: My, my you've buffed up since I last gave you one of these haven't
you Tenchi?

* Katy chokes on nothing in particular *
Katy: Tenchi? Buff? * Bursts out laughing *
Carl * laughing *: That's like saying Katy's pretty or Vegeta saying "Can we 
just talk about this over a cup of coffee?"
* Katy whacks Carl over the head with Elvis *
Katy: I am pretty, ya little pimple faced geek
Elvis: Thank you very much * Dissapears *
* All get sweatdrops on their heads *

Tenchi: Ryoko, how many times must I tell you not to surprise and choke me
like that?
Ryoko only pulled poor, helpless, oxygen deficient, Tenchi closer to her.
Tenchi eventually wriggled free and scampered

Carl: what has he turned into a cabbit?
Kiyo-Ohki: He better not have done.
* All look at her weird *
Libby: Scampered? I've seen him run like a scared deer but never scamper.

away and out the front door.
Ryoko: Hmm. Hey! Why the heck didn't I think of this before? Stu-pid!
Stu-pid! Stu-pid! Stu-pid!

Libby: Run! It's the fire alarm!
Washu * sweat drop *: That is actually what ol' Hades' fire alarm sounds 
like.

Tenchi hadn't gotten very far by then.

Carl: So he turned into a scampering slug?
Vegeta: I'm surrounded by idiots!
Katy: I think we all are!

He forgot the grocery list. He had
only walked about 25 yards away from the house when Ryoko approached him
from behind. Tenchi of course didn't notice until she (brace yourself)

* A dentist appears *
Carl * with sweatdrop, in panicky voice *: WRONG KIND OF BRACE!
* The dentist disappears again *
Vegeta: I smell a lemon
* Everyone glares at Katy *
Katy: It's not me this time! Honest!

gently put her hand on his shoulder.

* Everyone stares wide eyed at the screen *
Vegeta: Very shocking indeed
Carl: OOC! OOC! OOC!

Tenchi: YIPES! Ryoko!? Didn't I tell you not to surprise me like that?
Ryoko: Correction. You said surprise and choke, but I'm sorry I startled
you.
Tenchi: What's the big idea? Why'd you follow me?
There was a short period of silence.
Ryoko: Tenchi, I know I've been maybe just a tad too agressive but it's
because I...well...I love you Tenchi, with all my heart. And I'm really
sorry I...I...I...Dammit Tenchi, I need you to kiss me now!!! Now Tenchi!!!
(light sob)

Carl: AGH! THE ALIENS HAVE LANDED!  THE LIGHT SOBS HAVE COME TO TAKE OVER 
THE WORLD!
* everyone sweatdrops *

This was rather odd to Tenchi. He had never seen a demure Ryoko mixed with
an agressive Ryoko with no provocation. Ryoko fell to her knees and begged
Tenchi.
Ryoko: Please Tenchi. Just this once, I beg of you.
Then Tenchi pulled her back up,and toward his body forcefully and adjusted
her head to an angle. He then began to kiss her passionately. Tenchi thought
to himself " This? This is what I've been avoiding for these past years?
I've been holding back my attraction, my love for Ryoko to avoid such an
extremely pleasureable event such as this? Stu-pid! Stu-pid! Stu-pid!
Stu-pid!"

All: WE GET FIRE ALARM!!!!
Katy: What you say?
Carl: Can we stop talking like Shampoo and get back to MSTing? That was just 
Ryoko!
Libby: OOOOOH he just wants to see the lemon

Tenchi then moved his lips from hers to her neck where he planted soft
delicate kisses. Ryoko moaned as Tenchi pulled her even closer to him and
friskily bit her earlobe. Tenchi could feel her nipples becoming hard and
erect and slid his hand into her kimono to caress her round firm bosoms.
Tenchi: We can finish this in your room. But it definately will not be just
this once.

Katy: It's not like their gonna have sex once and then act like they hate 
each other.
Libby: It's happened * gives Vegeta a sidelong glance *

They snuck past everyone in the house and went to Ryoko's room.

Vegeta: So they sat on a rafter over the living room?
Carl: I guess so, look out! LEMON SCENE
* Everyone is suddenly wearing WW1 soldiers uniforms *
Katy: How'd this happen?
Washu: How the heck should I know!  Duck and cover!
* Everyone ducks behind the seat in front of them, but keeps eyes over to 
continue MSTing the fic *

There, they
continued what they were doing. Tenchi continued to kiss Ryoko on the lips
and run his fingers through her light blue hair until his hand travelled
downward and slowly undid her kimono. Ryoko unbuttoned Tenchi's shirt
slowly, caressing his hard, smooth chest with her fingertips. Then she
unzipped his trousers and removed his boxers exposing his hard, swollen,
appendage.

All: Appendage????

Tenchi then slowly removed Ryoko's drenched, soaking panties.

Vegeta: Ryoko peed herself again

Tenchi laid her on the bed

Katy: Aren't we forgetting just a little something... SHE DOESN'T HAVE A BED

and began to gently massage her breasts with one
hand and stroke her inner thighs with the other. Ryoko moaned with pleasure
but her urges were becoming unbearable.
Ryoko: Oh!! Tenchi, I want you inside of me Now Tenchi!!!
Ryoko began to stammer with desire. Tenchi laid Ryoko's head back onto the
bed and entered her.

Libby: Welcome to Ryoko, we hope you enjoy your stay

Ryoko let out a loud moan because of how wonderful this
felt. Tenchi gently rocked and then started thrusting himself deeply into
her, stroking her flushed chest and face.

Carl: Tenchi gave her a swirlie?
* everyone groans *

Ryoko's spine arched. This
thrusting caused waves of orgasm to pass troughout her body over and over
again.
Tenchi: Your'e so wet. Are you sure I'm the one who got you this hot?

Vegeta * as Ryoko *: No, it was Sasami
* Vegeta is hit over the head by three Akane style mallets *
Vegeta * flat *: OW!
Libby: DON'T SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT AGAIN
Katy: THAT WAS JUST SICK!
Carl: I WAS GONNA SAY KIYONE INSTEAD! BUT YOU RUINED IT!
* Carl is hit by two Akane style mallets and one Gallic gun blast *
Carl * crispy and flat *: Owwie!

Ryoko pinned Tenchi onto his back fiercely.
Ryoko: You're concentating too hard on pleasing me, Tenchi. Relax. Let me
please you.
Tenchi: But, Ryoko. I like to see you enjoying this.
Ryoko: I do enjoy pleasing you. Just trust me.
Ryoko straddled him and began to slide slowly up and down on his member.

Carl: I never knew he had MSN!

As you know Ryoko is extremely strong. It turns out her not so visible
was'nt any different.

All: Huh?
Carl: You're not making sense

She tightened her vagina around him, still sliding.
She leaned over and began panting in Tenchi's ear.

Carl: she's got some red ones, blue ones and sometimes she wears pink one * 
Starts drooling and Katy hits him, HARD *

Tenchi moaned with
delight and sqeezed Ryoko's firm yet just soft enough to grab, buttocks.
They both came at about the same moment. They then laid in each others arms
with legs intertwined.
Ryoko: Thank you Tenchi. That was spectacular.
Tenchi: Thanks for the compliment but I'm not done yet.
Ryoko: What!?
Tenchi pulled Ryoko to the foot of the bed so Ryoko's legs hung off the
edge. He lightly kissed her on the forehead. He lifted her long slender legs
over his shoulders and spread them a bit. He then ran his tounge around her
warm, wet vulva and slowly slipped it inside of her. Ryoko gasped. She
definately did not expect this. Then Tenchi becan to lick his lover's
throbbing, swollen clit while Ryoko moaned loudly until she came.
The lovers lie in each other's arms again with Ryoko's head rested on
Tenchi's chest. They stayed that way for a while. And just when they were
getting cozy...

* Everyone was too busy either throwing up, blasting the screen, staring 
goggle-eyed at the screen, or fainting to make any comments *

Tenchi: OH MY GOD THE GROCERIES!!!!!

* Everyone bursts out laughing *
Carl * laughing *: He's meant to say I love you at that point!

Ryoko: What?
Tenchi: The groceries! I completely forgot!! I was supposed to buy groceries
hours ago.

Meanwhile in the Masaki's kitchen...

Sasami: Where the heck is Tenchi with those groceries!? How am I supposed to
cook dinner without any freaking ingredients!!!????

Carl: Use normal ingredients!  Like aspirin or random amounts of spices!
* Katy hits Carl in the face with a beaver doll *
Katy: Sasami doesn't use your cookbook to get recipes!
Beaver doll: I'm Piles the Beaver, hey * disappears *

Ayeka: Watch your language Sasami.

Vegeta: Yeah, because freak's the worst swearword ever invented

I'm sure Tenchi will be back any minute
now.
Kiyone: Well she does have a point. Tenchi should have been back hours ago.
Mihoshi: I'll bet that Space Poilice Policeman

All: Who?

would find him in a jiffy!
Kiyone: Not now Mihoshi were annoyed enough as is.
Mihoshi: WAAAAAAAAH!!!
Washu: Nice move Kiyone. Now we have to endure hunger and a wailing idiot.

Carl: What? Is Katy in there with them?
Katy: Would ya look at that,  I'm all out of things to beat him with, 
NEVERMIND!
* Katy punches Carl in the face *

Tenchi tried to sneak through the living room to the front door.
Kiyone: TENCHI!!!!!!! WHERE ON EARTH HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME AND WHERE
ARE THE GROCERIEEEEES!!!!

Vegeta: So Kiyone is talking like Ayeka now?

Tenchi(faking a grin): Groceries? Heh-heh. What Groceries?
Grandfather: The ones I told you to get this afternoon.
Mihoshi: What's that in your teeth, Tenchi?
Kiyone: Yeah, What is that? Do you know,Washu?
Washu: I'll find out. Give it here.
Ayeka: I've got it. Here you go Washu.
Washu took a quick look at the object.
Washu: GAAAAAAAAAK!!!
All together: What is it Washu?
Washu: EEEK! IT'S A FRIGGIN PUBIC HAIR!!!!

* Everyone goes wide eyed *
Carl: Smeggin hell!

Sasami: What's a pubic hair?
Ayeka(covering Sasami's ears): Don't worry Sasami, you don't have any yet.
Washu: And exactly how would you know that?
Ayeka: I...um...uh...

* Carl starts to shiver wildly *
Carl: Bad flashbacks of the lemon, The Erotic Tourture chamber
* Carl starts shaking even more, then faints *
Libby: What's up with him?
Katy: How should I know? I'm only his sister!

Washu: But that's not the point. What we want to know is where it came from.
Mihoshi: Space Police Policeman

All: Who?

would know.
Kiyone: I don't think Space Police Policeman

All: Who?

handles cases like that!!
Washu: Well that hair is blue and the only people hee with blue hair are
Sasami which Ayeka claims doesn't have any and Ry...Where is Ryoko anyway?
Kiyone: Yeah.
Washu: So that's where you've been. Upstairs, eating off Ryoko and judging
by the state of your hair and clothes that's not all you were doin' up
there.
Ayeka: You...you mean?
Washu: Yes I mean.
Ayeka: This can't be!! I can't believe it!! Tenchi and and and

Vegeta: Is there an echo in here, here?
Libby: I think so, so.
Carl: Its very repetitive, repetitive, isn't it, it?

that beast
sleeping together!! It's an outrage!! WOLEY CARAPUS BENDER AND KITE!!!

* Everyone Bursts out laughing again *

Oh
crap, I'm starting to sound like the writer of this Fanfic to which none of
us characters belong by the way. Don't sue her.

Washu and Carl: Oh Crap!
Katy: I think Carl and Washu, done made a BIIIIIIIG mistake.

I refuse to believe that you
and that heathen have been copulating upstairs!! I refuse!!!
Washu: Go see for yourself she's probably still up there.
Ayeka storms up the stairs and checks Ryoko's room where she finds Ryoko
sprawled on the bed nude.

* Carl stared wide eyed at the screen and drools *

Ayeka: GASP!
Ryoko: Hi! Did ya miss me?

                                                END

Washu: That's the first half over, come out here, I got something you might 
want to see

================================================================================

* Everyone walks out of the theatre *
Carl: So what is it you wanted us to see?
Washu: Look out the window
* Everyone looks out the window, there is a large ship, like a Star 
Destroyer from Star Wars, only bigger *
Libby: Oh no!  We're being boarded!
Washu: Don't be stupid! That's the main ship! The H.M.S. Hades Void is just 
a shuttle for trans-dimensional work!
Vegeta: So your saying...
Katy: This ship, bigger that a normal space shuttle, is just a small pod for 
going to other dimensions?
Washu: Got it in one again!
* The ship starts to shake as it docks with the big one *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The MST Crew is standing in front of the H.M.S. Hades Void's Airlock *
Carl: Come on Washu! Open the door!
* The door opens and Washu runs out *
Washu: Sorry to keep you waiting, we got two rogue MSTers on the loose in 
here!
Katy: Who?
* Ranma runs past, being chased by Ayeka *
Ayeka: We had a good hiding place on this ship! But noOOOOOOooooo! You had 
to start stealing food!
Ranma: I was hungry!
Ayeka: But thanks to you, we'll end up being sent back to AnimePort#9!
Ranma: I'm soryyyYYYYYY!!
* Two metal claws come out of the wall which grab Ayeka and Ranma, and throw 
them into the transporter, which disappears *
Carl: NOOOOOOO! The transporter! How will we get back!
Washu: You wont! I suggest you explore the ship * Washu makes her 
see-through computer appear and starts tapping buttons, a pamphlet (you 
know, the kind you get at theme parks or other tourist attractions) appears 
in each of the MSTer's hands *
Libby * reading the cover *: Your guide to the H.M.S. Echo
Carl * reading one of the inside pages *: Cool! We can order food during 
MSTs!
Katy * Looking disgusted at a page *: AW MAN WASHU! THAT'S SICK!
Vegeta: What is?
Katy: We get two barf bags, ALREADY FULL INCASE WE RUN OUT OF OUR OWN BARF!
* Everyone Throws up *
Carl: That's disgusting, even by MY standards!
Washu: Oops! My bad! If you look at the back cover, there's a map of the 
ship, I suggest you head to the theater, before the sirens go...
* The Tellitubbies theme plays over the intercom *
Washu: ...off, he where'd Carl go?
Katy: Lets just get to the theatre
* Everyone arrives at the theatre, to find Carl shaking wildly on the floor 
outside the door *
Vegeta and Libby: What's up with him?
Katy: Irrational fear of Tellitubbies
Vegeta and Libby: Oh...
* Everyone walks into the theatre, but Washu goes into another door *

================================================================================

Tenchi Go Boom Part 2: Ayeka Go Boom

Carl: Hopefully there WILL be spontaneous combustion in this one
* A screen pops up in front of each of the MSTers with a selection of 
snacks, food, and drinks on *
Katy: Ooh! Chocolate Ice cream and coffee!
Carl: Hot dogs and rootbeer!
Libby: Cider pops and Vodka!
Vegeta: Popcorn, and... Water
* The food and drink appears out of the screens *
Libby: What good service!

This continues from when Ayeka found out that Tenchi and Ryoko were doing
something upstairs and went to see it for herself. Ryoko is lying in her bed
still nude and a bit mussed up.

* Carl is drooling at the screen *

Ayeka: You. You tramp. You harlot. You...you...you...you...(looking out the
door to make sure Sasami is out of earshot)

* Vegeta makes a sound of a shotgun going off, everyone laughs *

BITCH!!!
Ryoko: hmm...huh? Oh, what were you saying? I was busy lying on these
cumstained sheets thinking about riding Tenchi's big hard cock, but anyway
continue.
Ayeka: I know what's been going on up here. Washu found a pubic hair in
Tenchi's teeth. We all know everything. How could you do such a thing
without thinking about how I would feel.
Ryoko: Jealous are we? (plucking out a pubic hair) Here, you can have one
too.
Ayeka: Waaah! I can't take it anymore!! I never thought I'd have to take it
this far but it seems I must
Ayeka and Ryoko continue fighting. Meanwhile downstairs.
Kiyone: Geez, I wonder what's going on up there.
Washu: You know very well what's goin on up there.
Kiyone: I hope it's nothing like what was going on a few minutes ago.

Carl: I prefer to differ

Washu: Trust me on this Kiyone. With those two it can be one of three
things,an argument a fight or a war.

Everyone: A war.

Everyone: A war.

Carl: Can we call 'em or what?

Tenchi: I'd better go see what's going on up there.
Washu: I don't think you should.
Tenchi: Come on, Washu. What's the worst that could happen?

Vegeta: You cold get killed by the house blowing up?
Carl: Ayeka asks for a threesome with you and Ryoko? Hey wait that's a good 
thing!
* Katy whispers something to Libby *
Katy & Libby * singing *: Dr. Pepper, what's the worst that could happen?

Washu: Suit yourself but don't come back to haunt me when you're killed by
flying debris.

Carl * writing on paper *: one point to Vegeta...
Katy: You're keeping score?

Tenchi: (muttering) If they are fighting up there, I hope Ryoko isn't
clothed yet.
Washu: Whatd'ya say?
Tenchi: Um, I said uh Yep it's an all out war I'll bet.
Mihoshi: Oh really? I thought you said you hoped Ryoko wasn't clothed
ye....Hey....hrmph..mmph..mmnnph.
Noboyuki: My son. My son has finally become a man. And I was right there to
see it sort of. I just hope he doesn't become a maniacal pervert like...
Washu: Like you?
Noboyuki: Not me. I meant um, uh...Mihoshi! Yeah Mihoshi!

All: Mihoshi???


Washu: MI-WHO-SHI?!
stuff really. But what's a maniacal?
Noboyuki: You guys didn't believe me for a second did you?
Tenchi walked in to the room to find Ayeka and Ryoko still at each other's
throats. As he had hoped,Ryoko hadn't put her clothes back on yet.
Ayeka: TEN-chiiiII?
Tenchi: What? What are you staring at?
Ryoko:(giggling)  Well if you look down you will see that a
rather...large...tent has formed in your pants.

Vegeta * as Tenchi *: DAMN CAMPERS!

Ayeka: My, that is a big one. But as I was saying, TENCHI I HAVE HAD IT NOW
I AM GONNA FUCK YOU IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO! NOW YO HAVE TWO CHOICES.
EITHER I HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A BLUNT OBJECT AND RAPE YOU OR I HAVE A
THREESOME WITH YOU AND RY..o..ko. me and my big mouth.

Carl * writing again *: and two points to me
Katy: TWO POINTS?
Carl: cause I got it exactly right

Ryoko: Well between a potentially fatal blow to the head and a threesome I
guess you have no choice.
Tenchi: Threesome's fine.

Vegeta: Who died and left Tenchi his balls in the will?

Ryoko: Well it's better than being bludgeoned to death, I suppose.
After the undressing or in some cases reundressing and about an hour of
steamy foreplay....
Tenchi: Well, is now alright?
Ayeka: No, I'm not ready yet.
Tenchi: OK A little extra foreplay never hurt anybody.
An hour later...

Carl: A LITTLE extra? That's like a TRUCKLOAD extra

Tenchi: What about now?
Ayeka: Not yet!
Tenchi: We either start now or I'll use blue dental floss in front of you
for the rest of my life!!
Ayeka: You wouldn't!
Ryoko: Oh, he would. That's how this whole thing got started. Only it was
..."natural floss".
Ayeka: Just a little more time.
Ryoko: What are your legs closed for the night?
Ayeka: No, I want to savor my moment with Tenchi without being penetrated by
a large thrusting cock!!
Ryoko:Open sesame! (pinching Ayeka on the ass)
Ayeka:Giggle!

Katy: Why did she say Giggle? That's something Carl would do!

Ryoko: Stick your fork in her, she's done.
Ayeka: I am not! And you're beginning to sound like the writer of this
fanfic to which none of us charachters belong! Please Don't sue her.
Tenchi: Floss.
Ayeka: OK but start already! I don't have all night!
Ryoko: She wastes two hours saying she isn't ready yet and now she doesn't
have all night?
Ayeka: Hey! That wasn't..WHOOAA, that IS a big one!
So Tenchi started fucking her from behind when...
Tenchi: Ayeka, this is a threesome, remember eat or I stop.
Ayeka: But...
Tenchi: Floss! (thinking) I should have taken the blow to the head. At least
I'd be unconsious. And if I did die, who wants to screw a corpse? Oops.
Forgot Ayeka wants to screw me dead OR alive.
Ayeka: Oh, Alright. Bon apetit.
Ayeka surprisingly put her tounge exactly where she was supposed to put it.
At the same time, her fuses were about to blow.
Ryoko: You know, you're good. Have you been practicing on Sasami?
Ayeka: OH YES!

* Everyone screams *

Ryoko: Huh?
Ayeka: I'm gonna cum you idiot!!
As she came however something strange happened. She started singing on time
with Tenchi's thrusts.
Ayeka: I've got a wobbly bunch of crocus butts and there they are a stamping
in the crow!

* Everyone bursts out laughing *
Carl: What sorta weird drug is she on?
Libby: Why do you want some?
Carl: Hell yeah, how much funnier would I be with that shit?

Tenchi came to a sudden stop.
Tenchi: I can't do you,Ayeka.
Ayeka: And why the hell not?
Tenchi: You're weird.
She suddenly got up and skipped toward the door still spurting cum all over
the place.
Coincidently Washu came up to see what was going on.
Washu: Oh Geez, not again! What's that in your teeth, Ayeka? (plucking it
out) GAAAAAK!!!! ANOTHER FRIGGIN PUBIC HAIR? DON'T YOU PEOPLE EVER STOP TO
REST?
Ayeka: Well if you put it that way Tenchi, I hope you hear this well. I
CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!! I'M GAY! I'M GAY! I'M GAY!!! And Miss Washu is my
new lover!

* Everyone screams again *

Washu: Hey, I've been known to light a candle at both ends but I'm afraid
you're too weird for me.
Ayeka: Huh?
Washu: I heard you from downstairs. By the way nice hooters, Ryoko.
Ayeka: Here, I believe this pubic hair belongs to you. (running down the
stairs still naked) MIHOSHI! Hows about me and you take a walk say... to
that abandoned cave?
Ryoko: You know, Tenchi. You've got guts. If Ayeka tried to do that to me
willingly I'd be completely grossed out.
Tenchi: gros...gross...OH CRAP! THE GROCERIES!!! I forgot again. Blast my
erections!

* Everyone groans *
Carl: This fic isn't even good enough to have the piss taken out of it!

Washu: At this rate, by the time the groceries get here we'll be so starved
we'll all have your pubic hair in our teeth.

Everyone: Huh?

                                                    END
Stay tuned for Tenchi Go Boom Part 3 : Ayeka Interrupted
Everyone: HOOOORRRRRRAAAYYYYYYYY

Everyone is standing outside the theatre including Washu.

Washu: I suggest you have a look round this time. Have fun.

They all look at their maps for a few minutes Carl keeps turning his over 
mumbling to himself. A few minutes later...

Carl: COOOOOOOL! I gotta see this * he races off down the corridor *
Vegeta: Humph... A training centre? Bet it's a pile of f fucking shit.
Katy: I don't give a flying fuck about no training centre, this place has a 
holodeck. Shall we go to a seedy bar and pick up blokes Libby?
Libby: Hell yeah
