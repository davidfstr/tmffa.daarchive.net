A James 'Tonberi' DeYarman MSTing of the Tenchi Muyo fanfic
'Decisions Part 1.'
Note: This is my first MSTing.  I hope it is decent.

TONBERI:  (looking at his watch) Where are those guys?  Man, they
should be here by now.
(XoxoL steps in a few minutes later)
XOXOL:  Sorry I'm late.  You told me to be punctual, but I had to buy a
dictionary to find out what it meant.  I tell you, the more I learn
about your language, the more I realize the two are completely
different.  On my homeworld, something like this-
TONBERI:  Yeah, I know.  Listen, this isn't a Star Wars RPG; we're here
to riff, not to roll dice.  Just don't go on about 'your galaxy', ok?
XOXOL:  Fine.  Say, aren't we supposed to have three people here?
TONBERI: I believe he should be here any moment.
(A familiar looking hobbit steps in)
SAM:  Oi!  I hope I'm not too late!
XOXOL:  Samwise Gamgee?
TONBERI:  I needed someone with his humor expertise.  I think he will
complement the group quite nicely.
XOXOL:  Yeah, but Sam Gamgee...
SAM:  So, what have we got in store for tonight?
TONBERI:  We are viewing the Tenchi Muyo fanfic 'Decisions' by Amy
'Ryoko Forever' Swaby.  It's pretty simplistic and insignificant.
XOXOL:  'Ryoko Forever', huh?  You humans have such weird nicknames.
TONBERI:  And 'J'onash XoxoL' isn't a weird name?  Never mind, we've
got a fic to view.
(all sit down)

>TONBERI:  Not until I read this fic.

*                   *                     *                    *
  Outside the Masaki household birds were singing, the sun was shining,
it was a beautiful day, but inside everything was in confusion.

>XOXOL:  The water heater exploded.

Everyone had been shocked when at dinner last night Ryoko had announced that
she would be going with Tenchi to school when it started in the morning.
*         *          *       *     *          *          *            *

>TONBERI: That idea's been done before.
>SAM:  Look!  Polka dots & moonbeams again!

  Ryoko walked alongside Tenchi with a big smile on her face, she had
Washu make up a fake I.D. and Washu also took away her power of flight
and energy swords etc. in case she got too excited.

>SAM:  Excited?  Eeeew, nasty choice of words.
>XOXOL:  (as Washu) Exactly.  By using a totally unlikely solution for
>this situation, we not only make this fic even more inane but also
>eliminate the possibility of having any interesting events.

  Tenchi was slightly worried about Ryoko coming to his school, since
the last time she blew it up and then he was worried about how the boys
might react and then what Ryoko would do to them.

>XOXOL:  Let's hope she doesn't get 'excited'.
>TONBERI:  'Last time'?  You mean she's tried to go to Tenchi's school
>before?  When was this?
>SAM: In a better fanfic, probably.

    When they got inside every boy in the school was drooling when they
saw Ryoko walk in, some of the girls stood glaring at her as their
boyfriends were found crowding around her.

>TONBERI:  Maybe she's born with it.
>XOXOL:  Maybe it's Mabeline.

They walked to the principal's office where a teacher took Ryoko to the room
she would be tested in. Tenchi then left and headed for his class.
*        *         *        *         *         *          *

>TONBERI:  Sex Ed followed by Fan Fiction 2.
>SAM:  More moon beams!  That's three times now!

  The principal sat in his office with the Dean of Students looking over
Ryoko's grade's for the sixth time. "This can't be right she got
straight A's on all her math and science subjects and didn't need to
work anything out! "The principal said.

>XOXOL:  Call me imperceptive, but I never really thought of Ryoko as
>being exceptionally intelligent.

  "Maybe she cheated" stated the Dean.
  "No she only got average on her English and Social Science exams and I was
there she only had the exams and a pen."

>TONBERI:  Well, I doubt that the author is exceptionally intelligent;
>this sounds like most peoples' grades.
>SAM: (in a stupid voice) Better than D?  That be too good!

"Well the teacher for her class said he would watch her we'll know if
there is anything going on."
*       *        *        *        *        *       *        *

>XOXOL:  I've got a feeling English wasn't the author's first language.
>TONBERI:  Well, commas and pauses, anyway.
>SAM:  There they are again!
>TONBERI:  Shh!

It was lunchtime and Ryoko was not having a fun time as a group of boys
chased her down the hall. Suddenly someone grabbed her and pulled her
into an empty classroom,

>TONBERI:  (seductive voice) My darling, all these other men see you as
>a mere fling.  What I'm trying to say is that I truly love you...
>XOXOL:  Settle down, Casanova.
>TONBERI:  (voice breaking) B-b-but I...  Love... her!
>(breaks into tears)

she whirled around to see three girls around
seventeen. The one who grabbed her was tall, had long straight blue
hair, green eyes and a tan complexion. The second girl stood in the back of
the room and was, had had short black hair that she wore out, black eyes and
a dark complexion.

>XOXOL:  Wait, it said 'and was, had had short black hair'.  Was what?
>SAM:  Wasn't Kiyone, that's for sure.
>TONBERI:  (recovers from earlier) Mmmm, Kiyone.  Grrrrowl!
>XOXOL:  Well, if her hair is worn out, maybe she should replace it.

The last girl was of average height, had short auburn hair witch she kept in
a ponytail, brown eyes and a light complexion.
The first girl smiled and said, "I see you have problems with girl
crazy perverts too," Ryoko nodded. "My name is Amy. The short one is Gia and
the other one is Raquel."

>SAM:  (as Amy) I'm the author.  You can just call them 'Short One' and
>'Other One'.

"Who is she?" Raquel asked, "She's in our class right?"

>TONBERI: (as Raquel) Dang, she's hot!

"My name is Ryoko, this is my first day here, I sit next to Tenchi." The
girls turned around to stare at Ryoko and she then noticed that they had
been talking in another language and s had she.

>TONBERI: Jurian?
>SAM: Quenya?
>XOXOL: Oppish?

"You know English?" the girls said I unison.

>TONBERI:  Wait a minute, 'turned around to stare'?  You mean they were
>talking to Ryoko without looking in her direction?

"Uh. I traveled a lot when I was younger so learned some different
languages, but how do you know English? "She said which wasn't a total
lie.

>SAM:  Y'know, I'm a fan of the dubbed episodes, so this is kind of
>confusing.
>TONBERI:  I think it's confusing no matter what you prefer.

"Our original language is English we taught ourselves Japanese from
books we just moved here a while ago from Nassau, Bahamas where we were
born." Amy answered.

>XOXOL:  Oh, the Bahamas, yuck.
>SAM (clutching his head) Ah!  Use commas!  I Need pauses!

Gia walked up from the back of the room and said "Hey Ryoko we were just
heading out to the cafeteria when Amy pulled you in wanna come with us?"
"Sure!" So the group of new friends walked to the cafeteria
*       *        *       *       *        *         *        *

>XOXOL: (pulls out a copy of 'How to Spot Self-Insertion') 'Sign #4: If
>the suspected character, once having established an unnatural root in
>the story, then befriends one of the main characters...' (closes book)

Tenchi was sitting down in the caf wondering where Ryoko was. One of his old
friends Kevin came and sat down across from him "Hey Tenchi where's your
girlfriend?"

>SAM:  'Caf'?  'Kevin'?  This is too American!  It's like a SailorMoon
>episode!

"Ryoko is not my girlfriend Kevin we are just good friends"

>TONBERI:  (as Tenchi) We're just good friends who have casual sex,
>like friends who play racket ball with each other.
>(XoxoL elbows Tonberi in the side)

"Well it sure looks like she's your girlfriend she always sits next to
you and she lives in the same HOUSE as you...

>TONBERI:  (as Kevin) And she even sleeps with you and wants to do this
>& that with you-
>(XoxoL elbows Tonberi in the side)

well speak of the devil here she is now, and look who's with her it's the
girls who came here couple years ago they are weird."
"Just because they reject any boy who wants to date that does not make
them weird." Just then Ryoko and her friend sat at the table.

>XOXOL:  Looks like the author thinks of herself as weird.  I don't
>blame her.
>TONBERI:  (as Kevin) Yes they are weird they use these weird things I
>think they call them commas and they use pauses and sentences that
>don't run on don't you think that is weird Tenchi?
>SAM (clutching his head) Ah!  No more!

"Hi Tenchi these are my new friends Amy, Raquel and Gia."
"Hi" the three girls said in unison.
"Hi, Ryoko this is my old friend Kevin we played together when we were
kids."

>XOXOL:  No, they didn't.

Ryoko remembered Tenchi would sometimes bring his friend by the cave
when they were little.

>XOXOL:  No, he didn't.

"Yeah and I went to his old school too until it mysteriously exploded".

>XOXOL:  No, you didn't!

Tenchi looked very nervous when Kevin said that, what would he think if
he ever found out Ryoko had blown up the school.
*      *         *       *           *           *

>SAM:  Ah!  He'd show polka dots and moon beams again!

 School was over and Tenchi and Ryoko had just gotten home they had
dinner then Ryoko headed for the lab. She entered the lab and spotted
Washu "Washu I need to ask you something." Washu sat there ignoring her.
Ryoko sighed, "Mom."

>TONBERI:  Efficiency!  Writing fanfics in simple and miserably
>compressed forms!

 Washu turned around to Ryoko and smiled "Oh, hello little Ryoko I
didn't hear you come in. How was school."

>XOXOL:  Hey, I'm a near-human RPG character and even I know that
>needs a question mark.

  "It was fine I made some friends Amy, Gia and Raquel."
  "Those are English names aren't they?"

>SAM:  Well, pseudo-modern-make-up-something-to-be-different names, but
>yes.

  "On that point, they started speaking in English and I understood them and
replied to them."
  "You have the ability to translate any language or don't you remember
you did not speak Japanese before you came here."

>XOXOL:  Huh?

 Ryoko thought back to her time on the Souja, she couldn't remember much but
she remembered that Kagato had spoken in Jurian and so had she.

>TONBERI: OH, COME ON!  THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP!  Don't make up
>garbage like that!

 "You remember now?" Ryoko nodded in reply. "Now," Washu stood up and
looked at Ryoko. "You need to get some sleep, I can't have you falling
asleep in class."
Ryoko left the lab smiling she really did care for her mother although she
would never admit it aloud.
*       *        *        *       *       *       *        *

>SAM:  Y'know, some people have compared this fic to 'I Love Tenchi' of
>the OVA.
>XOXOL:  Really?
>SAM:  Yea.  They say 'Episode ten of the OVA takes about 30 minutes to
>watch, while Decisions took about 30 minutes to write.

Tokimi sat on her throne as a robed figure entered the room. "Lady
Tokimi you requested my presence?"

>TONBERI:  Tokimi is a high-level-dimensional entity.  She doesn't
>exist on this plane of reality.  The author doesn't know what she's
>talking about.

 "Yes I have a mission for you, I want you to go to Earth and retrieve
my sisters, they have neglected their duties for too long."
 "What if there is any resistance?"

>XOXOL: (as Tokimi) Resistance?  I just want them to clean their rooms
>and wash the windows, you bonehead!
>TONBERI:  That's probably what the author has in mind.

   "Your only concern is to bring back Tsunami and Washu, do what you
want with the rest."
"Yes my Lady." The robed figure then exited the room
"I will find what you are hiding sisters."

>SAM:  This is like a shoddy version of 'The Advent of the Goddess'.

To be continued...

>TONBERI:  Y'know, the author could bill this as a dark fic and say
>this is the climatic frightening part.

*            *          *           *          *          *
Author's Notes: This is NOT a self- insertion fic though my friends and
me do come from the Bahamas.

>XOXOL:  That's a load of crap.

I got all my info on Tenchi Muyo on the net and I have never watched it so
please, please, please E-mail me with comments on my story at
n.a.swaby@grouper.batelnet.bs

>TONBERI:  What!?
>SAM (clutching his head) Oh no!  That's why!  WATCH AN EPISODE, FOR >THE
LOVE OF GOD!!!  ARRRGH!  (collapses onto the floor)
>XOXOL:  (angry) Ick.  Well, the fact she's from the Bahamas probably
>also explains why-
>(Tonberi elbows XoxoL in the side)

this is my first independent fan-fiction so I want everyone's opinion.

>XOXOL: (very angry) Dirty poison, I'll give you my opinion!
>(stands up)
>TONBERI:  (pulling XoxoL back down) J'onash, calm down.  It's just a
>crappy fanfic.

It's better in the Bahamas :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TONBERI & XOXOL:  What?!
TONBERI:  What the heck is that supposed to mean?
XOXOL:  Maybe they have simpler tastes.
SAM: (lying on the floor) Ohhh, God...
TONBERI:  Calm down, Sam.  this is just a warm-up fic; It's insignificant
and almost makes fun of itself.  Just wait until we do something really bad.
SAM:  Oh, God...
XOXOL:  Well, that's for another night.  Until then, I'll see you later.  I
think that's how the saying goes...
TONBERI:  Just be sure to take the hobbit with you when you go.
XOXOL:  Sure.
SAM:  (half awake) Ahhh....
