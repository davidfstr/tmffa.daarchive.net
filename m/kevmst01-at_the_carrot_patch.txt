MST File 1: At the Carrot Patchby Kevin "Crusader" HughesThe room is dark, the only thing that can be seen is a desk and a chair facing away from the camera.  The chair swivels around and a blonde man wearing a collared shirt and a tie glances at the viewers.He begins to speak, "In times like these; fanfics are common.  There are the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Everyone reads the good ones and agree that they are in fact, good.  Everyone reads the bad ones, and some think they are good, but the others think they aren't so good.  And then there are the ugly ones.  Almost everyone thinks that these are bad.  These fanfics must be punished in some way (at least until the other fans can find the authors).  It is because of this need for retribution that MSTings have become so popular.  Four helpless people trapped in a room being forced to watch a horrible fanfic come alive.  What else do they have to do but comment and heckle it?  Well, tonight, I am pleased to present to you the MSTing of 'At the Carrot Patch.'  For those of you who don't know, this is a Sasami Lemon.  You have been warned... enjoy the show."The chair swivels around again and the room goes totally dark.*****************************************************Alexander Tormah shook his head.  The people he had summoned didn't seem to be willing to watch the fic.  He raised his voice.  "Okay, guys, listen up.  I'm not sending any of you back to your own universes until this fanfic is MSTed!"Pretz grumbled, "Fine.  I'll watch it"  Under his breath he mumbled, "I sure hope Linally waits up for me."Vegita just glared at Alexander and yelled, "I don't see how you had the ability to bring me here.  Your power level is nowhere near mine!"Alexander shot back, "Look, I told you already, I'm the god of Lightning on Anarania!  That is where you are.  Oh, and don't even bother hoping for your friends to use the Dragon Balls to wish you back to that dimension: it won't work."Vegita fumed, "All right.  I'll watch this stupid thing."Senichi Tamari raised his hand, "Hey, Alex, buddy.  What kind of fanfic did you say this was?"Alex replied, "It's a Sasami Lemon."Senichi grinned, "Well why didn't you say it was a lemon earlier?  I'm in!"Alex smirked, "How about you Misa?"Pixy Misa blinked and looked at Alex, "Well, I've got nothing else to do, plus I'd like to see what this guy does to poor little Sasami."Alex let out a big sigh, "Well, thank you all for finally agreeing!  Now, on with the show."  He left the room and pushed a few buttons.The other people took their seats.  From right to left the people are: Pretz, Vegita, Senichi, and Pixy Misa.  The film began to roll.*****************************************************>	Warning this is a Lemon fanfic; which means that it is adult >oriented and has sexual content.Senichi: Yeah, that's what I like to hear.Pretz: Whoa, okay... I'm glad I stayed.>If you are under legal age or easily offended by this kind of >material, then please hit the back button on your browser.Pretz: Hey, what's a browser?Misa: Never mind that...>This is also my first lemon fanfic and it's not that great and it may >not make that much sense.Senichi: Tsk, tsk, tskVegita: What's wrong?Senichi: He's setting us up for disappointment.Vegita: Well, we are here to MST it... doesn't that set you up for disappointment already?NOTE: none of these characters are mine and are the property of somebody else.Misa: Well, I think we can figure that out.Senichi: Quiet!  He just doesn't want to get sued.Misa: Oh... then shouldn't we come with a disclaimer too?Senichi: Uhm... I guess so... eh, who cares...Pixy Misa faceplants.>	Please send all comments or suggestions to: >Mike_Forever@hotmail.comAlex (from outside the room): You guys may want to take down that address.Pretz: Why is that?Alex: You'll see...Senichi: Shh, it's starting.>	It was a quiet day at the carrot patch and Tenchi was hard at >work picking some carrots for lunch.  Sasami had nothing to do that >day so she decided to go help Tenchi.  On her head sat Ryo-ohki who >miayed contentedly for she knew that they were going to the carrot >patch.Misa: Wha?  Ryo-ohki is a girl?Vegita: Apparently so... why?Misa: Well, that explains a lot.Pretz: What are you talking about?Misa: Oh, nothing... Ryo-ohki only kissed Sasami on one certain occasion.Senichi: What?  Really?  Wow, this fic might be better than I thought it would be!Pixy Misa facevaults again.>Tenchi looked up form his work and saw Sasami walking down the >road wearing shorts and a T-shirt.  Tenchi was sweating profusely >and decided to take off his shirt, to reveal a muscular chest, in an >effort to cool off.Misa: Woo hoo, take it off!  Wow, Sasami's brother is hot!Alex: Uhm... before this fanfic progresses any further... I should probably tell you that in the world where this fanfic is taking place... Tenchi isn't Sasami's brother.Misa blinks: Wow, first I learn that Ryo-ohki is a lesbian, and then that Tenchi was adopted.Alex facevaults.>Sasami saw Tenchi hard at work and noticed how cute he was when >he was bare-chested.Senichi, grinning: Heh, I know where this is leading...>Tenchi had always had a secret crush on Tenchi and didn't know how >to approach her.Misa: Wow... not only is Ryo-ohki a lesbian, Tenchi is adopted, loves himself AND he's a transvestite!Vegita: Hopefully, the author was talking about Sasami...Pretz: Please let it be so!>	As Sasami came into full view Tenchi's dick started to grow in >his shorts.  Soon Tenchi's hard-on became too hard to hide, >comfortably.  Misa: Wow, it's so big!  Maybe I should stop bothering Sammy and go after her adopted brother!Pretz, Vegita, and Senichi all groaned.Misa: What's wrong?Pretz: We all know what that feels like...Vegita: It's not pleasant.Senichi: Call it "Universal Male Empathy">Sasami, by this time had noticed the bulge in Tenchi's pants.  Tenchi >kept working despite his discomfort.Vegita, Senichi, and Pretz all stand up and salute: Now there's a trooper!>	Ryo-ohki had now dug a tunnel under the ground to get at one of >the carrots.  She nibbled at the first carrot she came to.  The carrot >was relatively large and would take a lot of time to eat.  Tenchi >came to the carrot that Ryo-ohki was chewing on and was unable to >rip it from the ground.  Sasami asked Tenchi if he needed any help >and bent down close to him glancing at his bulge, trying not to let >him notice.Misa: Lucky, I want to be there!Pretz: Uh, how old is she?Misa: Uhm... 10... why?Senichi, grinning: Oh boy, this is going to be fun...>Sasami squatted down next to Tenchi and started to pull on the >carrot.  After much effort the carrot was torn from the ground, >carrying the little cabbit Ryo-ohki with it, and sent Sasami and  >Tenchi flying.  Tenchi fell on his back and Sasami fell on top of his >stomach face down.Vegita: Wow, that "cabbit" thing must have incredible power.Pretz: What is it with you and this power thing?>Tenchi and Sasami both moaned slightly in ecstasy as Sasami's >pussy was mashed onto Tenchi's stiff dick.Pretz: Uh, should we be watching this?Vegita: What's more important... should that guy be writing this?Senichi just sits there drooling.>Sasami enjoyed what she was feeling and started to move her hips >up and down on Tenchi's bulge.  Tenchi was slightly dazed and as he >came out of it he looked down to see his fantasies come true.Misa: Tenchi IS a pedophile!  I knew it!  Maybe I'll have a chance with him after all!Alex: Actually, this fanfic is REALLY out of character for Tenchi.  But hey, no one said you had to give up.  Go ahead and try to get Tenchi.  You only have to fend of Ryoko and Ayeka.Misa: Ha, they are of no consequence.She begins laughing maniacally and Alex forms a sweatbead.>Tenchi reached down and lifted Sasami's tight shirt over her head >and flung it aside.  Sasami was meanwhile undoing Tenchi's shorts >as well as her own.  Tenchi lay totally naked under a half-clothed >Sasami.Senichi: Aww, we want to see her naked first!  Not him!Pretz, looking a little green: This can't be good.Vegita gulps: I've seen worse than this...Misa is still off laughing in the corner.All Sasami was wearing was her under-garments. Tenchi leaned forward between Sasami's young tits and undid her front-clasp bra with his teeth.  Tenchi removed the bra with a small tug.Senichi, cheering: Yes!  That's what we want to see!Pretz: Uh oh...Vegita gulps again: I've seen worse than this...>Tenchi's hands moved down and grabbed the crotch of Sasami's >panties.  Sasami started to get really wet now.  Tenchi slipped the >pink frilly panties off in a swift motion.  Sasami raised up to allow >her panties to come off, then she settle herself down on Tenchi's >stiff prick.Senichi: Wow, he sure is moving fast...Pretz turns a little greener.Vegita gulps yet again: I've seen worse than this...>Tenchi held Sasami on the tip of his prick and told the virgin >Sasami that this would hurt a bit, Sasami didn't care much because >she wanted Tenchi so badly.  Tenchi forced all of Sasami's weight >down as fast as he could.  Sasami cried out in pain as her pussy >gave way to Tenchi massive prick as she was split open.  Senichi: Probably too fast...Pretz groans and pukes all over Senichi.Senichi: Eww, gross!  Why did you have to do that on me?Pretz: Cause you're a pervert... talking about a ten-year-old like that.Senichi wipes himself off.Misa looks back at the screen: Wow, I was right, he is huge!Vegita gulps once again: I've seen worse than this...>	The pain quickly subsided and was soon replaced with pleasure. >Tenchi lifted Sasami until only the tip of his dick was left inside >Sasami.  Tenchi brought Sasami back down and lifted her slowly >back up. Tenchi continued this motion while lifting his hips up to >meet Sasami's downstrokes.  Sasami started to gyrate her hips >from side to side, trying to increase the friction inside her love >hole.  Senichi: Gotta hand it to them... for virgins, they sure do know what to do.Pretz: IS THAT ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT?  DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS SICK?Senichi: No.Pretz sighs in disgust.Vegita gulps yet another time: I've seen worse than this...>	Ryo-ohki was, meanwhile, still working away at the tip of the >carrot.  She had no idea of what was going on at the surface.  Ryo->ohki felt small tremors in the ground from Tenchi's humping action, >but thought nothing of it.Pretz gulps: Please let the cabbit stay down there...Misa: Judging from what this author has done so far... I wouldn't bet on it.>	Back at the surface both Sasami and Tenchi were reaching >their climax.  There was much labored breathing and moaning >between the two of them.  Tenchi slowed down a bit to try and >prolong the pleasure for both of them.Senichi: Like I said before, this guy knows technique!Pretz groansVegita gulps one more time: I've seen worse than this...>Ryo-ohki heard all the screaming and came up to investigate.  She >dug a tunnel along-side the carrot she was just eating and popped >her little head out.  She watched curiously as Tenchi and Sasami >screamed in ecstasy as they both climaxed.Vegita yells out: Projectile Puke of Doom!He then spews on the opposite wall, just missing the TV.Pretz gasps: Wow, I never thought he would have an attack like that...Senichi: Wow, that was fast... it's probably over.Alex, from outside the room: Actually, this is just the halfway point.Everyone in the room, except Senichi (who cheers), groans.>	Both exhausted, Tenchi and Sasami decided to rest for a while. >They just lay there to catch their breath and relax their muscles. >When they were rested Tenchi made the first move by rolling over >and reaching for the carrot that Ryo-ohki was nibbling on.Pretz: Uh oh...Vegita: This doesn't look good...Senichi: Ooo, sex toys!Vegita turns to Senichi and fires a Ki Beam at him, knocking him into next week.Pretz: Thanks.Vegita: Don't mention it.>Sasami looked up curiously and smiled at the thought of what >Tenchi was about to do. Tenchi dusted off the carrot a bit, kneeled >down in front of Sasami and stuffed the carrot up in her pussy.Vegita and Pretz puke on the floor.Misa: Come on you guys... it's not that bad.Pretz groans: What are you doing?Misa: Taking notes...Vegita: Why are you doing that?Misa: Some things in this fic have given me ideas of what to do to Sammy.Vegita and Pretz both groan in disbelief.>Ryo-ohki gave a whelp of protest and ran to Sasami.  She watched >Sasami's pussy swallow the carrot and then jumped in after it.Misa blinks: Is that even possible?She waits for a moment...Misa: Oh yeah... you blasted him... never mind...>Sasami squealed with delight.  Tenchi lifted Sasami and crawled >under her, laying her on his chest face-up.  Tenchi stuffed his cock >up her tight, little asshole.Vegita: Oh, great, there's more...Misa is fervishly taking notes.Pretz: Vegita, before we head back to our own worlds, want to help me find the guy who wrote this?Vegita: Excellent idea.Pretz: Thought you'd like it.>Ryo-ohki crawled up farther into Sasami's pussy in an effort to >retrieve the stolen carrot.  Ryo-ohki, realizing that it would be >impossible to pull the carrot out, sat and nibbled at the carrot.  >Ryo-ohki had to come up for air every once in a while, this >increased the friction in Sasami's pussy.Pretz: This is my fault... I wished for it to not happen, and then it did...>By this time Sasami was thoroughly enjoying herself.  Sasami's >tight ass muscles loosened up slightly, as Sasami began to relax.  >Tenchi began to move up and down and lifted Sasami in an effort to >get some friction on his dick.Senichi wakes up and climbs back onto the couch: Uh, guys... if I stay quiet... can I watch the rest?He looks at the screen and then hops onto the couch.Vegita: Why does he have to do this to a 10-year-old?Pretz: What did she do to deserve this?Misa: Oh, she is a terrible girl!  She ruins my evil plans at every turn!  She bothers me to no end!Vegita: Yeah, I hear that one... but isn't this a little extreme?>Tenchi slowly increased the pace at which he pounded his meat into >Sasami.  At the same time Tenchi reached around to tease his >lovers' clit.  His other hand grabbed Sasami's tiny pink nipple on her >left side.Senichi smiles: He does have good technique...Vegita glares at Senichi.Senichi: I'll be good...>Sasami brought her right hand up to her breast and ran little circles >around her nipple with her index finger.  Her other hand moved down >and reached between her legs.  She continued down until her hand >met Tenchi's balls, she then gave Tenchi's balls a light squeeze.Senichi, Vegita, and Pretz all groan.Misa: That "Universal Male Empathy" thing again?The three guys all nod.Misa: Thought so...>Tenchi returned the favor by pinching Sasami's nipple and clit >between his thumb and index finger.  By this time Ryo-ohki was >almost done the carrot and tried to push the rest of the carrot out >through Sasami's vaginal opening.  This gave Sasami a jolt of >pleasure and brought her close to climax.  Sasami let Tenchi know >this by tugging spasmodically on Tenchi's balls,The three guys groan yet again.Misa: Now, this has given me some good ideas.Vegita: Please... let it end soon!Pretz: This can't get much worse...> Tenchi began to hump faster and faster trying to bring Sasami and >himself over the verge of climax.  It worked, both of them moaned >and shuddered as they reached their second climax at the same >time.  Cum began to seep out of Sasami's ass, Tenchi waited until >he was limp before he withdrew from her ass.  Ryo-ohki had finally >pushed the rest of the carrot out of Sasami's pussy and began to >nibble on it.Misa: Is it just me... or is Ryo-ohki a little oblivious to the goings on of this fanfic?  Usually she bugs me too, now all she has is a one track mind... "Eat carrot."Vegita: Is it over?Pretz: Let's hope so...>Sasami looked over to Tenchi and lovingly whispered "I LOVE You >Tenchi."Senichi: Probably just the sex talking...Vegita: SHUT UP BEFORE I HAVE TO SEND YOU TO ANOTHER DIMENSION!Senichi: Another dimension?Pretz: Uhm... what would that accomplish... shouldn't you kill him?Senichi: Uh, please don't do that...Vegita: I would have said ki... ki... ki... send to another dimension, but as you can see... those fu.... fu... fu... mean censors won't let me.The rest of the people laugh.>End of Part 1All: Yay!>Stay tuned for part 2-coming soonAll: NO!!!Senichi: Yay!Vegita powers up and blasts Senichi into the back wall.Pretz: Thank you.*****************************************************Alex walks back into the room, "Well, you guys, thanks for helping me out with that."Vegita says, "No problem, but if you ever make me sit through something like that again... I'm going to ki... ki... ki... send you to another dimension."  Vegita growls.Alex chuckles, "Well, Pretz, you won't have to worry about missing dinner with Linally, I'll just send you to a few seconds after I took you away.Pretz replies, "Actually, I kinda lost my appetite, but thanks anyway."Alex shrugs and turns to the collapsed Senichi, "Uhm... I'll just send him back."  He looks over at Pixy Misa, "Well, I'll send you back too, but do me a favor, go easy on Pretty Sammy for a while."Pixy Misa replies, "Sure thing.  It will take me a while to get Ramia to approve of these new ideas anyway."Alex says, "Well thank you all again, I promise I won't subject you to anything like that again... anytime soon."Before any of them can protest, they find themselves back in their own universes.*****************************************************The chair swivels around once again.  "Well, I hope you have enjoyed this MSTing of 'At the Carrot Patch.'  If you didn't like it.  It was my first MSTing, so give me a break.  You can send any comments to me at KevCHughes@aol.com.  Thank you all for watching, and goodnight."  The chair turns around and the room goes dark.
