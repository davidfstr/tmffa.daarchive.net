<JS>  Hello again, and welcome to Norad III, the MSTing Battlecruiser.  As 
always, I do not own these characters, except for myself, and of course I 
don't own any characters in the MSTed fic.  Megaman X  belongs to Capcom, 
Washu Hibiki belongs to Pioneer, Meis Triumph belongs to Atlus and Red 
Company, Samus Aran belongs to Nintendo, and Captain Invictus of the 
Ultramarines First Company and Warhammer 40K belongs to Games Workshop.  With 
that said, on to the descriptions of our heros, and then to the MST.
Also, my spellcheck is broken, so there may be a few mistakes.  You will also 
have to read my last MSTs to get some of the jokes in this one.

NEVER FORGET 9-11-01

These are the tales of the crew of the Terran Battlecruiser Norad III.  They 
were trapped there by Dr. Wily, who forces them to read bad fanfiction.

<JS>  And, just to give you an idea of what we look like, here are some 
descriptions.

JS:  Formerly a bald human seventeen-year-old, but was recently changed by 
Washu to have one attribute from each MST crew member.  He now has an arm 
cannon called the J-Buster, a blue sword called the J-Saber, a helmet with 
ocular sensors in it, acid spit, and he didn't want anything from Meis.

Megaman X:  Last robot created by Dr. Light before his death.  Leads the 
Maverick Hunters fourth unit, as Captain.  Can interchange armor parts, and 
use a variety of weapons.  Wearing the Ultimate Armor, a black and cool-
looking armor that allows him to hover in midair, take lots of damage, and 
use a special Giga Attack.  For this time around, armed with the weapons from 
Megaman X2.

Samus Aran:  A bounty hunter from deep into the galaxy, her family was killed 
in a space pirate attack.  Wears a special suit of Power Armor that was built 
by the Chozo, or Bird-People. This version of the armor is the Varia suit.  
Armed with an array of different energy beams, that can charge up to become 
more powerful.  Has optical sensors built into helmet for better sight in the 
dark.  Hates all perverts, especially Meis.

Washu Habuki:  One of three Goddesses:  Herself, Tokimi, and Tsunami.  Self-
proclaimed "Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe", and nobody except 
maybe Yume has the brains to contest that title.  Wears her old Science 
Acadamy clothes, and is armed with her Holoputer.  She is 20,000+ years old.  
Also has a small forcefield generator, because of a certain pervert's 
continued insults toward a certain purple-haired princess.  Has her hair 
inside a hat, so that it doesn't catch on fire in case anyone decides to use 
fire weapons.

Meis Triumph:  Possibly the luckiest guy in the world.  He has twelve 
beautiful women all falling for him, and he isn't afraid to date them all!  
Wears a cloak, goggles, white pants, and a brown shirt.  Has his trusty W-
Blade at his side, and also can call upon many powerful beasts of magic to 
aid him. (For example, if Samus was trying to kill him again, he would summon 
Aquoon, the water dragon.) Probably the biggest pervert in the world, and 
proud of it.  Has a high threshold for pain, possibly because of the constant 
beatings he gets from the other MSTers.

Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company:  From the year 40,000, is 
second-in-command of one of the most powerful Space Marine Chapters in the 
galaxy, the Ultramarines. They are one of humanity's greatest achievements.  
He is eight feet tall, wears a suit of Terminator Armor.(Very large, bulky 
suit of all-enclosing mechanical armor, increases senses and reaction time 
one-hundred-fold.)  Armed with a Storm Bolter(Huge double-barreled gun with 
detonate-on-contact ammunition) and a glowing blue Power Sword.(four foot 
long blade, with a matter-disrupting field around it, basically allows him to 
cleave through anything) Has three hearts, four lungs, can spit acid, see in 
the dark, hear a pin drop from a thousand paces, run at speeds of up to 
thirty miles per hour, and is about the most loyal person to the Emperor of 
Humanity you can find.  Also wearing an Iron Halo, which gives him a powerful 
forcefield.

<JS>  Just so you know, this is a little storyline for the cast.  If you 
don't want to hear it, skim down until you get to three lines of dashes.

<JS>  (Hunched over computer screen)  Hey guys!  Come have a look at this!
<Washu>  What is it?
<JS>  I've found the blueprints for this Battlecruiser!
<X>  Does...does that mean..WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE?!
<JS>  Possibly.  Washu, You're in charge of designing an escape pod.  X, 
You'll be a welder, as will you, Zero.  Invictus, you'll be a laborer, and 
Meis,  you'll do all the dangerous stuff.
<Meis>  Aw, do I have to?
<JS>  What else are you good for?
<Meis>  ....I'll get back to you on that.
<Samus> (Thinking)  Maybe, just maybe, he'll kill himself.  Then I'll be rid 
of him once and for all! (Out loud) BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
<All but Samus> O__o
<Samus>  Huh?  Oh, did I laugh out loud?  Oops, silly me!  Heh, heh, heh.   
^__^;
<JS>  What did I tell you about "heh"ing?
<Samus>  I know, I know, it creeps you out.
<Washu>  So, shall we get started?
<JS>  Wait!  Don't make any sudden movements.  You do remember Wily is 
monitoring us, right?
<Samus>  So, what are we gonna do about that?
<JS>  That's where you come in.  Use your arm cannon to take out all the 
security cameras on this level of the ship.
<Samus>  Can do! (Runs off)
<JS>  When she's finished, which should be about *CHOFCHOFCHOFCHOFCHOF* now, 
we start the construction!
<Washu> (Typing on holoputer)  Analyzing the resources we have at our 
disposal, we can make an escape pod out of Twizzlers, Sno Caps, or Gummi 
Bears.
<JS>  That's not good enough!  Can't you scavenge some metal from the ship?
<Washu>  We could, but the pod would only be big enough for one person.  
We'll need a lot of Titanium alloy to build one for all of us.
<JS>  Dammit! (Pondering)  Hmmm...
<Invictus>  What are you thinking about, Jim?  *BLAMBLAMBLAM*  OW.
<JS> (lowering J-Buster) GODDAMIT DON'T CALL ME JIM!!!  Anyway, Washu, come 
up with a list of what and how much of it we need.  I'm going to go check the 
other levels for some Titanium. (Walks off)
<Meis>  Boy, ain't he just Mr. High an' Mighty!  *BLAM*  PAIN!
<JS>  I can still hear you, Meis.  Well, I'm off.
<Washu>  We should hurry, before Wily gets his lackeys down here.
--------Switching to JS's POV--------
<JS>  Boy, it sure is dark in here.  What level is this?  Fifth?  And how 
many more till the storage bay?  A hundred?!  Dammit, I've been sitting in 
this stupid elevator for two minutes! (Music starts playing)  OH NO!  NOT 
ELEVATOR MUSIC!!  NOOOOOOOOOO!
--------Back to the others--------------
<Zero>  Huh?  What was that noise?  Oh well, probably nothing.
<Washu>  We're going to need at least two tons of Titanium for this escape 
pod to work.
<X>  I just hope JS can find some.
--------Back to JS-----------------------
<JS>  I am NOT listening to this crap music!  Where's that damn speaker?!  
THERE IT IS!  *BLAMBLAMBLAM*  (The music wavers, then dies) Ah, peace at 
last!  So, what floor am I on now?  Hmmm.the sixtieth?  Good, good.
-----Yet again, back to the others----
<Washu>  Analyzing data..COMPLETE!  Now we have a definite list of supplies 
we will need to build the pod.
<Meis>  So, what will we need?
<Washu>  Let's see...two tons of Titanium alloy, sixty pounds of Pop Rocks 
and twenty gallons of Coca-Cola for propulsion, a glass disc so we can see 
out of the pod, and food for us while in the pod.
-------------you know-------------------
<JS>  FINALLY!  Got to the storage bay!  Now, where's some Titanium alloy?  
AHA!  Good ol' plot device!  There's some right there!  (Starts walking 
towards it, but is suddenly blocked by two figures)
<Duff Mcwhalen>  Aye?  An' who are yoo?
<JS>  I'm nobody.  And if you want to press the issue further, You're going 
to get real intimately acquainted..with what your BRAINS look like!
<The Skyver>  You're not getting past us! (starts neighing)
<JS>  Oh, am I?  (Starts blasting at the figures)  DIEDIEDIEDIEDIE!!!! (The 
dust settles, and Duff Mcwhalen is the only one left standing)
<Duff Mcwhalen>  Ye missed me, keedo.  Looks like yer arse is oot the windee!
<JS>  OHBOY.  *BAMKICKWHOMPSMACKTHUDPOW*  GET HIM OFFA ME!!!
----------Back to the others------------------------
<Washu>  Hmmm..I wonder how JS is doing?
----------Back to a very badly beaten JS---------
<JS>  Well, I don't know what's more humiliating.  Being beaten by a whale, 
who by all rights should be beached, or not getting the Titanium alloy.  I 
guess I'll have to go back to the others and say that we can't build the pod.  
(Leaves and goes back to the others)  I couldn't get the Titanium alloy.
<All but JS>  WHAT?!
<JS>  It's guarded by some big whale guy.
<Zero>  That bastard Duff!  I'll get him for this!
<JS>  I guess we can't build the escape pod.
<Washu>  Right.  So, with that little side-story accomplishing absolutely 
nothing, on to the MST!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------

<JS>  I hope Wily isn't too pissed about us destroying all the security 
cameras.
<Wily>  JS!!!!!!!!!!  Did YOU do this?!
<JS>  Uhhh...no!  It was her! (Points to Samus)
<Samus>  Why you little traitor!  C'mere!  (Starts chasing after JS)
<Wily>  Well, just for trying to escape, I'm going to give you a little 
treat!
<Washu>  CANDY?!
<Wily>  No, something much MUCH worse.  A Tank Cop fic.
<All>  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!  Not "Sammy's Little Secret"!
<Wily>  No, it's not that.  Although, I might have you do that one in the 
future.  This one isn't a lemon.
<JS>  (Running from Samus)  Oh, so it's just a badly-spelled fic.  That's 
all?
<Wily>  It's called, "Kain's Revenge".  It's a very BAD darkfic.
<JS>  Great, just what we need.  Samus, calm down.
<Samus>  Fine, but I WILL get you for this.
<Wily>  Well, get in the theater, before I have Duffy come down there.
<JS>  EEK!  Okay, okay!
-------All enter the theater--------

Disclaimer: I love Tenchi Muyo, but I didn't come up with them.  So don't sue
me.

<Washu>  Wow, what an intelligent disclaimer.

I love the Tenchi Muyo villains even more then I love the heroes.  

<Meis>  Could that be why this fic is called "Kain's Revenge"?

It takes a
good villain to make a great hero.  My two favorites are Nagi and Kain.
Nagi

<Meis>  HOMINA HOMINA!  *BLAM*
<Samus> Settle down, tiger.

- Has a darker hate for Ryoko, then Ryoko has for her.  Kain - Is the
embodiment of pure evil, dedicated to one goal and one goal alone, the
complete destruction of the house of Juria.

<Invictus>  What the hell is the house of "Juria"?
<JS>  My mom got a letter telling her that she had "Juria" duty.

This story is dedicated to Kain, one of my favorite villains.  

<Meis>  As I said before, could that be why you called this fic "Kain's 
Revenge"?

If you want to
see my other favorite villain Nagi.  Then read my series "A Matter of Life or
Death."  Coming in mid August or early September.  I know you'll love it.

<X>  If you mean "love" in a hate sort of way, then yeah, we'll love it.

Warning: If you are offended in any way by the deaths of any Tenchi Muyo
characters.  Then you should not read any further.

<Washu>  This is NOT a good sign.

Note: This is a Dark Fanfic which mean it has death, murder, bad word, ect.

<X>  WOW!  It has ONE bad word!
<JS>  It also has bad SPELLING!

by Tank Cop

<JS> (KsaWarrior, old geezer) EVIL!

Kain's Revenge

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Sasami enter Washu's subspace lab.  The little crab on the door rings!

<Samus>  How exciting!

RING,
RING

<Invictus>  I know I'm gong to get shot by JS for this one, but...RING RING 
RING!  RING RING RING!  PHONE CALL!  PHONE CA--
*BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM* (Falls unconcious)
<JS>  NEVER make ANY Pokemon references in my presence!

"Washu its time for dinner."  

<JS>  Not a single comma or apostraphe to be seen for miles around.

Sasami calls out, but no one answers.

"Washu where are you, hello."  

<Washu> I think I'm getting dumber just by reading this.
<All>  Duh dur duhhhhh....  

She ventures even deeper into her subspace
lab.  Until she comes apon 

<JS>  TYPO!
<Meis> (Begging)  PLEASE don't point out EVERY spelling mistake!
<JS>  Sorry, it's my duty as an MSTer!

a strange blue ball (or sphere if you want). The
ball vibrates with a strange blue glow (like in Star Wars 1, you know the one
Boss Nass held up at the end).  

<Invictus>  This man's idiocy is painful.

It almost seems alive!  

<All> (Sarcastically)  WOW!

"What a pretty
ball."

<X>  I think Sasami is portrayed as a raging idiot in this fic.

 Sasami walks over to the ball and holds it in the air.  Suddenly, the ball
gives off a burst of energy.  "AAAGGGHHH!"  Sasami screams in pain and falls
unconciseness on the floor.  

<JS>  So she's not concise anymore.  Is that too bad?
<Samus>  Well, at least he's staying in one tense.

THUMP

Hours later.  "Sasami...Sasami...are...you...ok?
Can...you...hear...me?"

<Washu>  It..is I....William.............................Shatner.

Sasami slowly opens hear eyes and sees Washu kneeling
infront of her.  

<JS>  I think there is supposed to be a space in between "in" and "front".

"oh Miss Washu I'm..."  

<JS>--Going to be killed off early, don't you wish you were me?

Sasami fades once again out of
conciseness.  

<JS>  So, she became concise again?

Washu takes Sasami in her arms and takes her to her room.

<Samus>  To WHO's room?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Aeka stands outside Sasami's room with a wet wash cloth while Washu tells
her
what happened.  "It seems that Sasami touched some kind of alien device that
caused her to lose conciseness for several hours."  

<JS>  I can't believe this person can't spell the word "concious".

"Is she going to be ok?"
Aeka asked.  She'll be fine, she just has a very bad headache.  She'll need
some aspirin and some sleep, that's all."  "Can I see her?"  Aeka asks.
Washu
nods.  "Yes, you can see her, but don't stay to long she needs her rest."

<JS>  He used the wrong "too".

Aeka walks into the room and sits down on the bed next to Sasami.  "Hi
Sasami, how are you feeling?"  Sasami opens her eyes.  "I'm just fine Aeka.
What happened to me, and why do I have a horrible headache?"  

<X>  Didn't she just say she was fine?

Aeka giggles.
"You mean you don't remember what happened to you!"  

<JS>--She asked without a question mark.

Sasami looking
confused.

<Invictus>  Tank Cop IS Shampoo.

 "No, I can remember going into Washu's subspace lab, then the rest is a
blur."  "Well, from what Washu tells me is you touched something you weren't
supposed to touch."  

<Samus>  Bad Sasami!  Bad bad!

Sasami sits up in bed.  "Is Washu mad at me?"  

<Washu>  No, I'm not.  Because you touched that ball, you're going to be 
mercifully killed off early.

Aeka
shacks her head.  

<All> (Singing)  LOVE SHACK! BABY, LOVE SHACK!

"No, she's not mad at you, but in the future you shouldn't
touch what you don't understand.  Now take some aspirin and go to sleep."

<Meis>  Yes, it's true.  Aspirin cures everything from a headache to a 
concussion from "shacking" your head too much.

Sasami takes two aspirin with a glass of water and lays down.  Then Aeka
kisses her on the forehead.  Aeka then turns off the lights and leaves the
room closing the door behind her.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Around 1 a.m. 
<JS>  Here we go with the numbers instead of words again.

Sasami started to whine in pain and speak out loud.  "I won't
let you hurt them!"  A strange voice comes from within Sasami.  "You can't
stop me girl, its futile.  I will take your mind, body, and soul by killing
you very soon!"  

<Invictus>  Could Kain talk?
<JS>  I'm pretty sure all he did was growl and moan.

A powerful shock wave comes from Sasami that causes the
glass of water to shatter.  

<All>  POP!

Sasami then jumps up in bed drenched in sweat.

Sasami runs down stares to get a dust pan and a broom.  When Ryoko Who 

<Samus>  The Who!

just
happened to be fixing a late night snack, saw her.  "Hey Sasami I thought
that you were asleep with a bad headache.  So what are you doing up?"  Sasami
with a tremble in her voice.  "I had a bad dream and must have knocked the
glass of water in my room on the floor, and now the floor is covered with
glass.  

<JS>  The run-ons, oh God the run-ons.

I don't want Ryo-Ohki to get glass in her feet when she wakes up in
the morning."  Ryoko puts her snack aside and walks over to her.  "Is that
all, come on kid I'll help you clean up that mess."  "Thanks Ryoko."

<Washu>  Are you sure this is Tank Cop?  There haven't been many errors yet.
<JS>  Maybe he has finally learned about the miracle of the spellcheck.
<Meis>  Well, at least this isn't "No Need for Extream".  That was all just 
one big typo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Sasami's headaches got worse as the days went on and the nightmares got more,
and more intense.  Then one day the nightmare became real.

The others were outside playing ball, when.  "Sasami its me the bad dream of
yours, its time to die!"  She looks around but sees no one.  "Where are you,
what do you want?"  "I am Kain, and you are what I want!"  In seconds
Sasami's body erupts in a burst of energy as she screams.  "AAARRRHHH!"  

<Meis> (Pirate)  Arrr...arrr..
<JS>  OH.  MY.  GOD.  HE KILLED SASAMI!  (Twitching)  I now have a newfound 
HATRED for Tank Cop.

The
force of energy released from her breaks every window in the house at once.

<All>  POP POP POP POP POP POP POP!!!

CRASH  

<Invictus>  Bandicoot!

Tenchi looks back at the house.  "What the Hell was that!"  

<JS>--He asked without a question mark AGAIN.

Aeka with
a look of fear.  

<Samus> (Mihoshi)  And who are you again?
<X>  Oh, I'm just Look of Fear.

"Oh my God, 

<Washu>  You killed Sasami!
<JS>  You flaming bastard!

Sasami's in there!"

They get in the house to find that every room in the house is covered with
glass.  Then they get to Sasami's room to find Ryo-Ohki crying over Sasami,
laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.  

<All> (Stunned silence)

Aeka grabs Sasami off the
floor and rushes her to Washu's subspace lab.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

An hour later, Sasami's body lays dead on a table in Washu's lab.  

<All>  (Stunned silence)

While
Washu try's 

<JS>  It's an extra apostraphe!

to calm down a hysterical Aeka, 

<Meis>  (Ayeka)  COOCOO FOR COCOA PUFFS!  COOCOO FOR COCOA PUFFS!

Kain takes control of Sasami's
body and stands up.  Washu and Aeka see the body of Sasami rise.

Washu and Aeka are astonished by what just happened, approach Sasami.  Then
Sasami lifts up her head to show that she is no longer Sasami!  

<JS>  And we now see the true nature of Tank Cop begin to show.
<Invictus>  What do you mean?
<JS>  He's starting to use a lot of exclamation points.

Her eyes have
turned to an emerald green color and her voice has changed to sound like
Kain.  

<JS>  I can't really remember, but aren't Kain's eyes black or purple or 
something?

Washu and Aeka take a step back.  Aeka asks Sasami what's wrong.
"Sasami what's happened to you, are you ok?"  "I'm sorry Sasami can no longer
hear you, she's dead!"  

<Washu>  Oh, I am SO going to kill this guy when I find him.

"Who are you?"  Aeka demands.  "I am Kain or what's
left of him.  

<JS>  Still no commas in sight.

After my last battle I was badly wounded and needed some place
close to the ones who had stopped me to rest, so I changed into that energy
sphere.  

<JS>  Never mind the fact that he was utterly annihilated by the Dimensional 
Cannon.

Then when Sasami touched me I was able to assimilate her, by taking
her life force and growing in strength."  

<Samus>  I'm pretty sure Tsunami would have stopped him.

Washu walks up to Aeka.  "We have
to get out of here now Aeka!"  Kain seeing that they were trying to leave
blocked there exit by using his power to pick up a computer and flinging it
against the door.  "Going somewhere are you!"  

<JS>  He may have learned the power of the spellcheck, but he still hasn't 
learned about question marks.

Washu thinks of another way
out.  "Quick to the transporters (yes, I know how stupid that sounds, but its
all I could think of)!"  Washu turns back to see Aeka looking strait at Kain.

<Meis>  Like the Bering Strait?

 Kain looks at Aeka and laughs.  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  How heroic your going
to die for someone that no longer exists!"  

<JS>  I think I see a comma on the horizon...nope, just a tumbleweed.
<Washu>  And usually, you don't put commas in while the character is 
laughing.

Aeka with her power fully
charged.  "Give me back my sister you Asshole!  

<Invictus>  Notice how he capitalized "asshole".

Or by God I'll..."  "What
kill me, go ahead I'll just find a new host."  Washu grabs Aeka.  "He's
right, she's gone.  We have to go before Kain finds a way to reach full
power."  Aeka takes one last look at her sister then gets to the transpoter
and is beamed outside the house where the others are sitting on the porch.

<JS>  Yet another run-on.

The others run up to her to see if she's ok.  "Aeka where did you come from,
and what's going on?"  Ryoko asks.  Then Aeka yells out.  "KAIN'S BACK AND
HE'S KILLED SASAMI!  WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSE NOW!  RUN,
RRRUUUNNN!"  

<JS> (Pretending to run away from an exploding car in slow motion)  
NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

They all run, but the only thing that went threw Aeka's mind

<Washu>--Was the baseball bat that was just thrown at her.

was, where's Washu?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Washu was setting the transporter to take her out, when Kain, who is still
in
Sasami's body grabs her by the neck and rams her against a wall!  

<JS>  I didn't know Sasami's hands were that big.
<Washu>  Good, I'm going to be killed off early, also.
<X>  I wouldn't be so sure.  Remember, he used Sasami as a host body.  He'll 
probably do the same to you.
<Washu>  Aw, crap!

"Now tell
me you witch, how to get my old body back and at full strength, or die!"
Washu looks at Kain then spits in his face!  

<Invictus> (Kain)  GAAAAH!!!  You spit gum in my eye!  AAAAAAAAAA!!!

"Fuck you!  I'll never help
you,
you Bastard!  

<Washu>  YEAH!  GO ME!

You may have killed Sasami and taken her body, but there's no
way in Hell that I'll never help you!  So go ahead and kill me!"  Kain looks
at her and laughs.  "Ha, ha, ha!  You don't need to be alive to give me what
I want, I'll just assimilate you and take what I need, 

<X>  I was right!

just like that little
weak Sasami!"  

<JS>  Nevermind the fact that she was a goddess.

And with that Kain puts Sasami's hands on Washu's head and a
blue energy, much like lighting leaves Sasami's eyes and enters Washu's.
Then Washu is assimilated.  

<All>  (Sarcastically)  Wow.

Washu screams out in pain.  "AAAARRRRHHHH!"  

<Meis> (Pirate Washu) Avast ye mateys!

Then
Sasami's body falls lifeless on the ground.  The Kain, 

<X>  Who's "The Kain"?
<Washu>  I think he meant "Then Kain"?

now in Washu's body
speaks.  

<JS>--To Sasami's dead body because there's nobody else around.

"No more need for that lifeless shell anymore.  Now onto the remake
of my old body."  Kain using Washu's mind starts to create a new body.

<Samus>  So, now he can use the minds of the assimilated?  Not to mention, he 
can assimilate in the first place?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Yosho looks out the window of Mihoshi and Kiyone's apartment 

<All>  O__O!  What the HELL is he doing there?!

and thinks of
what has happened up till now.

It has been three days since Kain killed Sasami and maybe Washu as well.  We
are all staying at Mihoshi and Kiyone's apartment.  

<All>  Oh.

Aeka has not said a word
since we got here, I think the shock of what happened to her sister has
caused her to break down.

Ryoko is all primed for an attack on Kain.  I have never in all the years
that I have known her, I have never seen her so sad!  Oh she hides it behind
anger and rage, but I know that she misses Sasami, just as much as we all
do.

<JS>  TANK COP WILL BURN!!!

Ryo-Ohki has not stopped crying since we arrived here.  She won't even eat a
carrot.  She just sits in the corner with a picture of Sasami and crys.

Mihosi and Kiyone have been trying to call the rest of the Galaxy Police for
assistance, but can't get a transmission out.  

<Washu> (TV Commercial)  Yes, it's the new and improved KAIN!  He now has the 
power to assimilate, block radio frequencies, survive a galaxy-destroying 
blast, and do just about anything else this stupid author wants!

We can't even leave the
planet!  There's some kind of energy field surrounding the planet.  It must
be Kain, he doesn't want use to leave.

<JS>  That's a new one.  It seems that Kain has become Green Lantern or 
something, because now he can make energy fields.

Tenchi has told me about Kain.  How it was Kain who caused my daughter
Achika
to die at a young age.  I will avenge Achika, Sasami and Washu by sending
this demon strait to Hell!

<JS>  There's a strait that goes to hell?

Thank God my son-in-law is out of town on business.

Suddenly, there is a bright flash in the apartment and the whole group was
transported to the front of the house!

<All> (Mock amazement)  oooooooooooooo...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Kain, who is still in Washu's body looks at every one.  "Well, well.  Nice
of
you all to come, this will make killing you all so much easier!"  Aeka looks
right at Kain.  "What do you want Kain?"  "I want you all to witness the
rebirth of my old self before I kill you all!"

Just then the ground begins to shack 

<All>  (Singing)  LOVE SHACK!  BABY, LOVE SHACK!

and the house explodes!  

<All>  POP!

KA-BOOM  Then
a
strange black mass starts to cover Washu's body.  Then a few seconds later
its over.  

<All>  YAY!
<Wily>  I don't think he meant the fic was over.
<All>  CRAP!

The black mass starts to form into the body of Kain.  "Ha, ha,
ha!
 I won't need this anymore."  Washu's body is pushed out of Kain, then lays
dead on the ground.  "Now you die!"

<Meis>  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!

The others stand ready to fight to the death.  Within seconds Tenchi, Ryoko,
and Aeka have switched into full battle suits, just like the last time they
fought Kain.  Then Yosho and Tenchi activated there Light Hawk Swords, 

<Washu>  I don't remember there being TWO Light Hawk swods, do you? (All 
shake their heads)

while
Ryoko powers up her sword, and Aeak 

<All>  O__o
<JS>  Who the hell is "Aeak"?

readies her power.  Mihoshi and Kiyone
ready themselves too.

<X>  Oh please, that's like shooting ping-pong balls at an elephant.  All 
you're going to do is get it pissed off!

Then they attack, first Ryoko with a few energy blast's, 

<JS>  One too many apostraphes.

then Aeka with a
force field boll 

<JS>  I didn't know she could make Weevils with her power!

intent on crushing Kain.  But it didn't work.  Kain was
able
to rip threw the force field like it wasn't there, and the energy blast's

<JS>  He still thinks that apostraphe belongs there!

didn't even faze him.

Aeka is knocked to the ground by the force field exploding.  Kain then try's

<Meis>  This guy must have an apostraphe fetish or something.

to smash her but Tenchi jumped in and got her out just in time.  "Are you
ok?"  Tenchi asks.  "Yes, but he's to strong, we can't win."  Tenchi looks
at
Aeka then looks at Kain.  He sees that the others are doing there best but
he
knows its not going to be enough.  Then he gets an idea.  He take one last
look at Aeka.  "Aeka remember that what I do, I do for the world!  I will
always love you."  

<JS>  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Oh, my sides! That's some funny shit!
<Washu>  Watch your freakin' mouth!

With that Tenchi kisses Aeka then runs at Kain, cuts a
hole in his stomach to get inside Kain and then activates his Light Hawk
Wings!

<JS>  Which would have instantly swiss-cheesed Kain, but I bet Tank Cop 
doesn't know that.

Kain's body starts to glow blue with energy released by Tenchi, its more
then
Kain can take.  "NNNOOO!  I can't end like this, not like this!"  
<All> ECHO!  ECHO!  Echo!  Echo!

The mighty
Kain explodes in a burst of energy so bright it can be seen from space!
KKKAAA-BBBOOOOOOMMM

<JS>  Noooo, you do it like THIS!  *KRAKA-BOOOOOOOOOM!!!*

After the dust clears, there is nothing left but an empty creator and
Tenchi's Light Hawk Key.

<Washu>  I do think it's called the Master Key, not the Light Hawk key.

Aeka looks at the creator that is left where Kain and Tenchi once stood.  She
runs to the crater, kneels down, grabs the Key and crys.  

<All>  WAAAAAAAAAH!!

"TENCHI NNNOOO!

<Samus>  JS, if you do that slow-motion thing again, you're going to have one 
less arm.
<JS>  EEK!

OH GOD NO NOT YOU TOO, OH PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!"  She just sits there on her
knees with the Key in her hand and crys.  While the others join her.

<X>  And I leave.  And the others join me.
<Wily>  SIT DOWN!

Its over Kain is dead, but at what price.

<JS> Looks like he used up all his apostraphes.  And he didn't use a question 
mark.

(END)

<All>  YAY!

I hope you enjoyed reading my story, I just love Kain.  

<Washu>  I think that was blatantly obvious.

Yes, I like dark
Fanfics I think that they are the best kind of story.  

<JS>  You freakin' Goth!
<Samus>  Now now, don't insult the Goths.

Please read my series
coming out in two or three months.  Please E-mail me what you think about my
story, I want your opinions.

<Meis>  After we're done, He's going to regret ever saying that.
---------All exit the theater-----------

<JS>  Of course, there's the review part.  So, Washu, how did you hate it?
<Washu>  Well, all I can say is I got killed off early and didn't have to 
suffer the rest of the horrible fic.
<X>  It flat out sucked.  Then again, ANYTHING by Tank Cop sucks.
<invictus>  I'll have to agree with X on this one.
<Samus>  It was just plain disgusting.  
<Meis>  He gave Kain too many new powers.
<JS>  Yes,  he HAS to do something to poor little Sasami in ALL of his fics, 
whether it be a lemon or darkfic.
<Samus>  So, what do we do now?
<JS>  I think we should just go back to our rooms and serve our sentences for 
trying to escape.
<All but JS>  Fine, fine.
<X>  If you weren't such a wimp, we could've--*BLAMBLAMBLAM*  Ouch.
<JS>  Now, anyone else want to say something about me not beating Duffy?
<All> (Quickly)  No.
<JS>  Good, good.

The End.

<JS>  Hello all, it's me again.  I just want to express my personal opinion 
about this fic.  It was HORRIBLE!  Even though he didn't screw up as many 
times as I thought he would, it was still badly written.  Kain never had all 
those powers, and even if he did, he never showed them in the movie.  I'll be 
back with another MST soon, be sure to check it out!
