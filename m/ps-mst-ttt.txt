An MST by Steve

Email: psychosteve999@yahoo.com

All the characters depicted in this story are of my own creation with
the
following exceptions:

      Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Psychotic killer created by the one
and only Jhonen Vasquez.
      Crow T. Robot: That lovable golden robot from the "MST3K" TV show.

These are my original Characters:

 Sharrin Bowman: An oppressed fifteen-year-old goth/skater female
featured in a book I wrote entitled "Frogs 2: Toads".
 Psycho Steve: Pretty much a self insertion into the story.  Psycho
Steve is one of the nicknames I am known under.  Others include Evil
Steve,Whisper, and White Steve.
 Till: A seven-foot-tall German Dragon named after Rammstein's
vocalist.  This Character is featured in a sort of Quentin Tarintino
meets Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy my step-brother Andy and I came up
with.
 Nastica: Till's girlfriend who appears in the third installment of the
trilogy. Originally a dragon as well (a Russian one for a particualr
reason) was later transformed into an American 100% human goth chick.
Hey, I have a fetish for gothic girls, sue me.

These six brave souls have been forced to view really bad fanfics by
satanic stringbeans that came out of hell after Till agreed to sell his
soul to them for a gallon of vodka.  Afterwards realizing what a stupid
thing he had done Till would not give the stringbeans his soul.  The
stringbeans made a compromise, however.  If he and his friends viewed
one bad fanfic a day they would not torture and kill all of them.  The
stringbeans have set up a movie theater inside the dwelling of the six
unfortunate souls.  Only fanfics can be viewed in this theater,
however.  A certain time every day they will all be forced into the
theater to view the fic of the day.  Resistance to comply will result in
immediate death.  So begins the MST.

The whole gang sits in the living room watching Tales from the Hood on
TV.
TILL: Man, this movie is so fuckin' weird man.
SHARRIN: (laughs) You call this weird?
TILL: What would you call it?
SHARRIN: Funny. Pink Floyd's the Wall was hands down the weirdest movie
I've ever seen.
STEVE: That is hard to top in terms of weirdness.
CROW: I've seen some pretty weird movies in my time, especially during
my time up in the SOL.
JOHNNY: What do you think the weirdest one you saw was?
CROW: Wow, it's hard to say, there's so many. Well, one of the stupidest
ones I've ever seen was Werewolf.
STEVE: Oh God, I HATE that fucking movie. I rented it once, having been
fooled by the cool cover, and it was just...horrible.
CROW: And what the hell was up with that terrible accent Natile had?
STEVE: Oh man, I wanted to hit her so hard...
The voice of a satanic stringbean is heard.
SATANIC STRINGBEAN: Report to the theater now for todays fanfic entitled
"Tenchi the Thug".
Everyone groans in displeasment and head over to the theater.

Tenchi the Thug

<STEVE: This fic is really stupid and shouldn't be viewed by anyone.>

This fic contains sex and stuff so you have to be 18+ to read it.

 Washu had been in her lab for a week straight, working on her
newest, greatest invention she had made yet!

<TILL: Bad lemon repellant.>

Of course, no one else
knew what she was working on though......

<CROW: Oh, of course.>

 "At last! My latest invention is now complete!" yelled a very
happy Washu.

<SHARRIN: (as Washu) You hear that, walls, my invention is complete!>

 "My invention is so perfect! It can totally alter the personalty
of a person in seconds!! I can't wait to test it out!"

<CROW: Just thought I'd explain that to the audience.>

Washu chimed very
happily, yet devilishly.

 Everyone else in the household had been going on with their lives
like normal, except they had been wondering what Washu was up to all
that
time she was in her lab.

<STEVE: So, not like normal then.>

 All of the girls and Tenchi, minus Washu,

<JOHNNY: Plus two thirds, divided by three, equals DIE!!>

were just sitting around
in the living room, when Tenchi asked,

<NASTICA: (as Tenchi) Have I hit puberty yet?>

"Does anyone have any clue as to what Washu is working on now??"
<SHARRIN: The real question is "does anyone care?">

"Its funny you ask that Tenchi." said Washu, which to everyones suprise
had
snuck up on them just before Tenchi asked his question.

"Well, actually, I haven't  created anything new, I was just cleaning
up my entire lab a bit." said Washu.

<JOHNNY: (immitating Invader Zim) You lie! You liiiiiiiie!!>

"You took a whole week to just clean your lab?!" said Tenchi.

"Well my lab does expand over the size of multiple planets!" said
Washu proudly.

<ALL: ...really?>

"Oh, I see your point." said Tenchi.

 Everyone else just didnt really give a damn at all anyways

<CROW: Kinda like us.>

and
had already left to just finish the rest of their day.  Washu returned
to her lab to admire her creation.

"Well, Tenchi will be the perfect subject for my experiment!  And the
best
part is I can do it to him while he sleeps!  That way I wont have to
lure
him down here and into a trap." said Washu quietly to herself.

<SHARRIN: Why doesn't she just not say it out loud at all, as there is
no need to?>

 Later that night, Ayeka and Sasami were already sleeping, Yosho was
at his shrine, Ryo-okie was sleeping on the living room floor,

<JOHNNY: (referring to Ryo Ohki) I'm gonna kill that thing so bad.>
<STEVE: Not before I do.>
<JOHNNY: (to Steve) We'll see about that...>

 Washu was in
her lab, Kiyone and Mihoshi were out on patrol and weren't due back for
at
least a week, Noboyuki was busy watching his porno flicks

<TILL: I bet it's La Blue Girl he's watching.>
<NASTICA: (to Till) Hey, don't drag a cool hentai flick into a shitty
lemon.>
<TILL: (to Nastica) Yeah, you're right.>

inside his bedroom,
and the only people still moving about were Ryoko and Tenchi.

"Tenchiiiiii!" said a very horny Ryoko as she glomped onto Tenchi.

<CROW: "Glomped"?>
<TILL: That is a real word, belive it or not.>
<CROW: Whoa.>

"Please Ryoko, im really not in the mood to screw around right now, I
want to get some sleep." said an angry Tenchi.

 Ryoko pouted a bit then said,

<SHARRIN: (as Ryoko) I will kill you dead!>

"Fine Tenchi, but just you wait till morning! I'll have you then!"

 Then Ryoko phased away, and Tenchi headed to his bedroom mumbling
to himself,

<STEVE: Sounds like he's taking after Washu.>

"Gee, I wonder what Ryoko will try to do to me tomorrow morning" said
Tenchi in a sarcastic tone of voice.

<CROW: (as Tenchi) I talk to myself a lot. Long monologues, complete
with sarcasm.>

 After Tenchi retired to his room, he had fallen asleep pretty quickly,
the devilish little red haired Washu

<SHARRIN: Hey, her hair is pink, buddy.>

stepped out of her lab snickering to
herself as she head up the stairs towards Tenchi's bedroom.  She stepped

into his bedroom and quitely approached his bed,

"Now lets see what type of personality I should give Tenchi."

<JOHNNY: How 'bout DEAD?>

Washu whispered
to herself.

"Hmmm... I need to give him one that would be very easy to notice, so I
will know if it worked or not....

<TILL: A nymphomaniac.>

I got it!" Washu whispered very enthusiastically
this time.

<STEVE: Damn, she talks to herself out loud more than the Maxx does.>

"The classic American Detroit Thug Personallity! aka: ADTP" Washu
snickered
under her breath.

<SHARRIN: That's not very interesting.>

 And with a few clicks Washu's invention was ready to go, she aimed and
fired, and then nothing happend, Washu was very puzzled,

<CROW: Jigsawed, if you will.>

"Wasnt it supposed to make a sound or something?" Washu asked herself.

<JOHNNY: (yelling at screen) YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU FUCKING MADE IT!!>
<NASTICA: (to Johnny) Calm down there, dude.>

"I guess it didn't work... DAMN! and all that hard work too!!" Washu
said
that so loud it almost woke Tenchi up.

<JOHNNY: (yelling at screen) THEN DON'T TALK TO YOURSELF OUT LOUD
ANYMORE!>
<STEVE: (hands Johnny a pill) Here, take your prozac.>
<JOHNNY: (swallows pill) Thanks, I needed that.>

 Quickly Washu left Tenchi's room and returned to her lab, very angry
at what had happend.

_______________________________________________________________________

 The morning soon arrived and the sunlight shone in through Tenchi's
window.

<CROW: And Tenchi happened to be a vampire and was disintigrated, the
end.>

A groggy Tenchi awoke only to be greeted a split second later by
a naked Ryoko landing on top of the blanket he was under and locking
into
a deep kiss with him,

<SHARRIN: Whoa, there's a 'good morning' for ya.>

"MMMMPPHHHH" moaned Tenchi.

"Im sorry, were you trying to say something?" asked Ryoko very
seductively.

"DAMN BITCH! you is one fine ass hoe!" beamed Tenchi.

<ALL: WHAT?!>

 Ryoko just sat there stunned at what Tenchi just said, that is untill
Tenchi ripped off his blanket showing Ryoko his naked body and his
growing
hard on.

<NASTICA: It's out of control! It won't stop growing! SOon it will
comsume everything on the planet until there is nothing left!>
<TILL: (to Nastica) Shut up.>
<NASTICA: (to Till)Ah, blow it out your ass.>

Tenchi just grabbed ahold of Ryoko and slammed his cock into her
pussy,

"Ooooh Tenchi, Im so suprised!" Ryoko managed to choke out.

<CROW: Does he have his hands around her throat or something that it
makes it difficult for her to speak?>

"Whose yo daddy! whose yo daddy!" said Tenchi as he rammed her harder
and harder.

 Ryoko was in total bliss as Tenchi fucked her, sending her into orgasm
after orgasm.

<STEVE: It keeps going and going, nothing outlasts the Energizer
orgasm.>

Tenchi blew his load into her, then set her down in the bed
next to him and got up to get dressed, Ryoko just sat there dazed in mix

of happy and puzzled emotions.  Tenchi headed down the stairs and ran
into
Ayeka on the way,

"Tenchi are you alright?? I heard some loud noises and came up to check
and see if you were ok!" said a very worried Ayeka.

"Damn girl! you is one white ass cracka!" said Tenchi.

<NASTICA: (as Ayeka) Yes, I IS.>

"E...x..cuse me?" Ayeka stammered out.

"All yo white folk be hatin up on ma skin color, damn crackas."

<TILL: Did Washu intend to turn Tenchi into a stereotypical black
person? Is that what's going on?>
<JOHNNY: Some shit about his skin color, I dunno.>

Tenchi
murmured as he walked passed a dazed Ayeka.

 Tenchi proceeded to the kitchen where he was greeted by a wonderful
smell,

<SHARRIN: Fresh poon.>

"What be cookin? it betta be KFC and biscuits and gravy or i gunna bust
out ma nine and blast someones ass."

<CROW: Y'know, Tenchi's voice and this dialogue he is speaking do NOT
mix well at all with each other.>

Tenchi said to Sasami as he walked
into the kitchen.

"Wwwhat?" Sasami asked.

"y'all herd what i be sayin hoe!" Tenchi snapped back.

 Sasami started cry at the cruel things Tenchi had said,

"Shut yo fuckin mouth biatch!" screamed Tenchi.

<NASTICA: Someone please stab him in the head before another word leaves
his mouth.>
<JOHNNY: Dibs!>

 Then when Tenchi noticed there wasnt any KFC or biscuits and gravy,
he got very angry and pulled out his glock nine,

<STEVE: From his ASS apparently.>

(no gangsta should ever
be without it! I guess thats why he has one)

<CROW: You're the author, you should know where it comes from!>

"THATS IT MUTHA FUCKA!!!! YOU GOIN DOWN BIATCH!" screamed Tenchi, as he
proceeded to blast her ass into the next millenium, making a humping
motion
every time he fired a shot.

<TILL: Hey, hey, he's dragging Don't be a Menace straight through the
mud by doing that.>

"Straight up Detroit husslin!" beamed a proud Tenchi.

 Then Tenchi proceeded to steal her shoes,

<CROW: Apparently Tenchi has a use for a tiny eight-year-old's shoes
that none of us can think of.>

and just as Tenchi was stuffing
Sasami's body into a cabinent,

<STEVE: Ice-T came out and shot Tenchi lots of times, in the face, with
a really big gun.>

Ayeka came running into the kitchen after
hearing the loud bangs.  Ayeka was totaly shocked at what she saw next,
a pool of blood on the floor, and Tenchi shoving Sasami's corpse into
the
cabinent.

<ALL: (laughing)>
<SHARRIN: Way to be subtle, Tenchi.>

"OH MY GOD! Tenchi what have you done!!!!!"

<NASTICA: You killed Kenny!>

yelled Ayeka.

"Damn not yo cracka ass again! well i cant be lettin yo go to da cops
bout
dis one..." said Tenchi.

 Tenchi then loaded a new clip into his trusty gun, and before Ayeka
even had the chance to run,

<JOHNNY: The entire world was blown up from a giant meteor and they're
all dead now.>

Tenchi pulled up his gun and held it sideways,
in true ghetto fashion, and pumped her white ass with a clip load of
lead.

<ALL: Shut up.>

"Aint no hoes gonna be sendin me to da slamma again!"

<TILL: Again?>

said Tenchi as he
repeatedly shot her lifeless body.

 Tenchi then headed out of the house and up stairs towards the shrine.

"YO, anyone home?" Tenchi said as he approached the shrine.

<CROW: (as Yosho) No.>

 Yosho stepped out of the shrine and saw Tenchi,

"Ahh Tenchi you are here pretty early" said Yosho.

"Yo dawg wazzup?" asked Tenchi.

 After hearing what Tenchi just said, Yosho knew it was time to show
his true form.

<STEVE: Huh?>

A bright light flashed over Yosho and when the light went
away, all that remained was a black thug.

"Wutup mah nigga!" said Yosho.

<ALL: WHAT THE SHIT?!>
<TILL: Did Washu do something to Yosho too?>
<SHARRIN: This is really, really, REALLY stupid and I want it to go away
right now.>

"Ma brutha! long time no see dawg!" said Tenchi.

"Yo got yous a crack pipe? i gots sum crack rock in here." said Yosho.

<CROW: It's economical not to have a plot. Then you can just...have
people saying things.>

 Tenchi then pulled out a crack pipe from his pocket and him and Yosho
went into the shrine and smoked some crack, like the crack heads they
are.

"Yo nigga, lets blow this joint." said Tenchi.

"I hear ya dogg." said a wacked out Yosho.

<JOHNNY: (grinding his teeth) So many tortures await those two.>

 Yosho then pressed a button on a statue, and a large garage door
opened

<STEVE: Since when was there a garage door on the shrine?>
<SHARRIN: Ever since this stupid author wrote it in.>

and a lowered purple 1977 LTD rolled out, it was one phat ride,
sittin on gold spokes, hydraulics, and one phat ass sound system to
boot.

<JOHNNY: Perfect for them to crank there talentless and utterly annoying
ghetto music from.>

"Check out ma pimpin ride, nigga." said Yosho.

<SHARRIN: (as Tenchi) NO! DIE!!>

"Damn dawg, that bein one phat ride." said Tenchi.

 Tenchi hopped into the driver seat, and Yosho hopped in the back

<TILL: Why doesn't Yosho drive his own car?>
<JOHNNY: ...He's stupid and annoying?>
<TILL: Oh yeah.>

and
proceeded to lock and load his guns to do some drive by's in Tokyo.

<CROW: Yeah, just gonna kill some random people.>

Just
as Tenchi was about to drive away he said,

<STEVE: (as Tenchi) Wow, I just realized how stupid I sound talking like
this!>

"Shit dawg, fuck, i needs ta go pick up mah hoe"

 Tenchi hopped out of the car and ran to his bedroom where a still
stunned Ryoko lay on his bed, Tenchi grabbed Ryoko's arm, which startled

Ryoko, and head for the door,

"Les go bitch, we be blowin dis joint!" blared Tenchi.

<CROW: I'm gonna try swallowing my tongue, maybe the pain from that will
put this fic out of my mind.>
<SHARRIN: (to Crow) You don't have a tongue.>
<CROW: Damn.>

 Ryoko just nodded and followed along and they hopped into the car.

 Washu came out of her lab and headed towards the kitchen, when she
arrived she screamed in horror as she saw Ayeka's bullet ridden corpse
lying on the floor.

<JOHNNY: (immitating Nelson Muntz) Ha ha!>

Washu immediatly headed out the front door only to be
confronted by Kiyone and Mihoshi,

"Hi Washu! We are home a little early because Kiyone said we couldnt
afford anymore food!" said a very enthusiastic Mihoshi.

<CROW: Mihoshi; the woman with the brain the size of a chick pea.>

"Mihoshi, will you shutup!!" screamed Kiyone.

<STEVE: My thoughts exactly.>

"Oh my god! We have terrible news..." Washu said, but was cut short by
a strange rumbling.

<TILL: Graboids!>

"That rumbling is very strange... its too rythmic to be an explosion."
Washu said, apparently forgetting about the news she was going to say to

Kiyone and Mihoshi.

<CROW: Yeah, she just happened to forget about the bullet filled, blood
soaked body of Ayeka lying on the floor ten feet away from her.>

 Kiyone was about to reply, when all of the sudden a purple LTD came
speeding around the corner, with the bass from its music rattling
everything
around.  The LTD came speeding for them, and just as it was coming very
close to them, Washu screamed,

<SHARRIN: (as Washu) SUUUUUUURGE!!>

"SHIT!! GET THE FUCK DOWN!!"

<SHARRIN: (as Washu) GET THE FUCK FUNKY!!>

 But it was too late, the LTD speed by and Yosho stuck his AK-47 out
the window

<SHARRIN: I thought he hand a handgun...oh well.>

and loaded Washu, Kiyone, and Mihoshi with hot steaming lead.

 As Tenchi drove away, Ryoko gave him head while he was driving,

<CROW: Just thought the audience would like to know that.>

and Yosho said,

"I smoked those cracka asses!!!"

 Then the effects of the personality device on Tenchi wore off,

<CROW: Yeah...sure...why not?>

and
he didn't know where the hell he was, and he felt something really moist

rubbing up and down his penis,

<JOHNNY: A leech, hopefully.>

and he looked down to see Ryoko giving him
one sweet blow job, Tenchi couldn't hold himself any longer and he
cummed
into her mouth as he let out a sigh of relief, but with all this action
going on, Tenchi forgot that he was driving

<CROW: I didn't know it was that easy to forget that you're driving.>

and they drove off a cliff screaming all the way down untill they
crashed onto the ground and their
car promptly exploded, incinerating all 3 of them.

<JOHNNY: Thank you.>

_______________________________________________________________________

<NASTICA: There's more?!>

All that remained was Noboyuki and Ryo-okie.  Without Sasami around to
cook the food, Noboyuki became very hungry and ate Ryo-okie raw.

<JOHNNY: Damn! He beat me to it!>

Then
Noboyuki went to jackoff to some porn, he jacked off to hard and his
penis ripped off.

<STEVE: Ummm...how 'bout "NO".>

Seeing that he no longer had a penis, Noboyuki knew
there was no more point to life, so he promptly killed himself.

<CROW: The author seems to be tying up any loose ends as quickly and as
lamely as possible.>

_______________________________________________________________________

     THE END

"DAMN BITCH! you is one fine ass hoe!" beamed Tenchi.
