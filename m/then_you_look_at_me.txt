Disclaimer: This song isn't mine, I got it from Celine Dion's CD: All The
Way, so don't sue me, I'm broke. I submitted this song because it reminded
me of Ayeka.

Then You Look At Me
Adapted by: Ryoko "Tillie" Masaki

Laugh and cry, live and die
Life is a dream we are dreaming
Day by day I find my way
Look for soul and the meaning

Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And I am not lost anymore

People run, sun to sun
Caught in their lives ever flowing
Once begun, life goes 'till it's gone
We have to go where it's going

Then you look at me
And I always see
What I have been searching for
I'm lost as can be
Then you look at me
And i am not lost anymore

And you say you see
When you look at me
The reason you love life so
Though lost I have been
I find love again
And life just keeps on running
And life just keeps on running
You look at me and life comes from you

Author's notes: It's kinda sad, isn't it. It sort of reminds me of "No Need
for Karma" in the Universe episodes, when Ayeka pours out her feelings to
Tenchi. Well, let me know if it fits the mood. E-mail me at: ggg@jackie.ca
