Top Ten Scene Improvements for Tenchi Forever
        by Cav

10) *Tenchi is looking at Haruna in the tree.*
    <Ryoko> Alright I'm taking care of this right now.
    *Ryoko proceeds to slash Haruna's head off.*
    <Tenchi> Ryoko... now what the heck are we going to do with the
    next 90 minutes of the movie?
    <Ryoko> Well we could give the fans what they really want and have
    lots of mad passionate sex?
    *Tenchi thinks it over.*
    <Tenchi> Hmm... Ok sounds fine with me. It's certainly better then
    screwing that old maid.

9)  *Tenchi and Haruna are about to have sex. Suddenly a great big
     Buddha statue drops on top of the pair and kills both instantly.*
    <Washu> Sorry kiddies, but nobody in their right minds wanted to
     actually see that.

8)  <Haruna> Well looks like I finally got myself a man! Let's see...
    *Haruna looks at the figure who is very pale, smiling, and has long
    black ponytails.*
    <Woman> Hello my name is Sakuya and I want to love you!
    <Haruna> No, no, this isn't what I was looking for!
    *Haruna proceeds to run for her life.*
    <Sakuya> Don't you love me Haruna? I can tell you do! Everyone has
    to love me! Let's get married!
    <Haruna> *running* Get *breath* back you *breath* evil creature!

7)  *Aeka has just talked Ryoko into going back for Tenchi for the
    third time.*
    <Ryoko> Aeka, are you really sure I should go back for him?
    <Aeka> Yes Ryoko I'm positive.
    *Ryoko gets up to leave and turns her back to Aeka. Suddenly Aeka
    takes out a lead pipe and smacks Ryoko in the back of the head
    knocking her to the ground cold.*
    <Aeka> Ha! Like you actually thought I was going to follow this
    lame script and let you take Lord Tenchi from me that easily! Washu
    reset the system so I can go back!
    <Washu> Um... Aeka I don't think...
    <Aeka> Just do it!
    *Ryoko begins to regain consciousness.*
    <Ryoko> Ow ow ow what the hell do you think you're...
    *Ryoko looks around to see that Aeka has already headed back into
    the other world to save Tenchi.*
    *Meanwhile back in the alternate world...*
    <Tenchi> Well it's about time you got here Ry...
    *Tenchi stares at Aeka who is there instead of Ryoko.*
    <Aeka> I've come to get you back Lord Tenchi! Don't worry I won't
    let her stand in the way of us again.
    *Aeka runs over to Tenchi and hugs him. Tenchi suddenly lets go and
    looks at Aeka scared out of his mind.*
    <Tenchi> Aeka um... how the hell are we going to get out of here?
    *Aeka suddenly stops and looks around. She looks up at the sky and
    suddenly realizes her mistake.*
    <Aeka> Oh no! Ryoko needed to fly out of here in the script! What
    have I done!
    *Aeka and Tenchi huddle together and start crying as the
    world around them collapses.*

6)  *Tenchi has just awoken and looks up to see Aeka and Ryoko standing
    there. He suddenly remembers they have come back for the second
    time and looks around.*
    <Ryoko> Tenchi are you alright?
    <Tenchi> Yes what happened?
    <Aeka> Well you see, you accidentally got knocked unconscious during
    all that was happening.
    <Tenchi> What happened to Haruna?
    *Ryoko and Aeka look at each other with sadistic grins.*
    <Ryoko> Oh she's fine, don't worry about her.
    <Aeka> Yes, let's get going.
    <Tenchi> Alright... although I really would like to know what
    happened with her.
    *Tenchi leaves with both the girls.*
    *Flashback one hour ago.*
    *Ryoko is holding Haruna, while Aeka is proceeding to punch her in 
    the gut.*
    <Aeka> This is for the last six months, you sick sadistic tramp.
    <Ryoko> Yeah and this is for making me have to actually come back
    here for him more then once.
    *Ryoko rips out a huge chunk of Haruna's hair as she screams in
    intense pain.*
    <Haruna> I don't deserve this! I've had a tough life! Don't you
    feel bad for me?
    *Ryoko and Aeka look at each other.*
    <Ryoko and Aeka> No!
    *Aeka proceeds to walk over to a cabinet and takes out a bottle
    of wine. She then breaks it over a table.*
    <Aeka> Well I don't think it is possible to make you any uglier,
    but I shall try.
    *Aeka proceeds to slash Haruna across the face with the broken
    bottle.*
    <Aeka> Why don't you go show our friend here what you think of her, 
    Ryoko?
    <Ryoko> It'd be my pleasure.
    *Ryoko, holding Haruna, takes off out of the house and proceeds to
    fly five thousand feet into the air.*
    <Haruna> Hey, what are you going to do to me?
    <Ryoko> Ever seen MnE? Well let's say I don't like you as much as
    I liked Mayuka.
    *Ryoko proceeds to let her drop all the way down into a McDonald's
    dumpster. All the time Haruna is screaming at the top of her
    lungs.*

5)  *Ryoko and Aeka are talking together before the movie starts.*
    <Ryoko> Damn it, I can't stand these things. They're so sensitive.
    <Aeka> Ugh, you think I have it any easier? These things weigh a
    ton! I can't move around with any comfort whatsoever.
    <Ryoko> Well how do you think I feel? These things are so small!
    How am I supposed to get anywhere with them?
    <Aeka> How long do we have to live with things like this?
    <Ryoko> I think for only about ninety-five minutes. Then everything
    will be back to normal.
    <Aeka> Damn it, I can't believe this is happening.
    <Ryoko> Well it wasn't my idea. Apparently some idiot in the art
    department thought it would look nice.
    *Ryoko and Aeka head off to film the movie.*
    *Ryoko and Aeka have just come out of a room marked "Surgery" at
    the end of the movie.*
    <Ryoko> Finally, things are back to normal.
    <Aeka> Yes, it's about time.
    <Ryoko> Ugh, let's never even think about going through that again.
    <Aeka> I would agree. I definitely liked the way they were before
    all of this. How did we get talked into switching?
    <Ryoko> I have no idea, but I'll never let it happen again.
    *Aeka looks down at her breasts.*
    <Aeka> Dear me! I can walk upright again! Those blasted things
    must've weighed a ton!
    *Ryoko looks down at her breasts, now back to their previous
    larger size.*
    <Ryoko> Oh my baby girls! *Ryoko hugs her breasts while she's
    kissing them.* Did you miss mommy? Did you? Oh I'm so happy to have
    you back!
    <Aeka> You know, Ryoko, I kind of got attached to those a bit.
    <Ryoko> Well, they didn't look that bad on you. I have to say I got
    used to yours a bit too. The sensitivity doesn't bother you after
    awhile does it?
    <Aeka> No it doesn't. You looked kind of nice with them.
    *Aeka and Ryoko look at each other nervously.*
    <Ryoko> Ok I'm out of here. *Runs off quickly.*
    <Aeka> Yes, that's a very good idea. *Runs off quickly.*

4)  *Tenchi and Ryoko are talking near the end of the movie where Ryoko
    has come to get him.*
    <Tenchi> Let's go home, Ryoko.
    <Ryoko> Oh no you aren't getting out of this that easily.
    <Tenchi> Um... Ryoko...
    <Ryoko> You know how much of a jerk you've been to me? Remember I
    did nearly get myself killed back on Jurai for you.
    <Tenchi> Ryoko can we...
    <Ryoko> You just keep quiet for a minute. How about how you were so
    thrilled to see me again after you got back to Earth and never even
    once said "you know Ryoko I love you so much I don't think I
    could've ever lived without you?"
    <Tenchi> Ryoko you can...
    <Ryoko> Shut up. How about the last six months? That was real nice
    of you to actually put the woman who kidnapped and raped you ahead
    of me a few scenes ago.
    <Tenchi> But Ryoko, I'm not going to remember any of this so
    bitching at me isn't going to help.
    <Ryoko> Oh this is helping plenty. How about back in MnE when you
    slapped me?
    <Tenchi> That's OVA Tenchi! I'm TV Tenchi!
    <Ryoko> That's right and you'll never be as good as OVA Tenchi, 
    either. And don't even bother to get me started on how inferior you
    are to Manga Tenchi.
    <Tenchi> Um... Ryoko this world is going to collapse in a...
    <Ryoko> What about in OVA 10 when you told me you hated me? Or what
    about Sakuya? Huh? What about this damn ending where I'm not even
    getting a fricken' kiss out of you?
    <Tenchi> Ryoko we really need to get going now...
    <Ryoko> You know, Tenchi, you're really quite a jerk. I have no idea
    why I even bothered to come back for you. You know what? Stay here
    and rot. I'm going to go get me a real man.
    *Ryoko takes off leaving Tenchi behind.*
    <Tenchi> Hey wait a minute! Get back here, Ryoko!
    *Tenchi looks as the world is beginning to collapse around him and
    realizes his fate.*
    <Tenchi> Come back Ryoko, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I'll give
    you a kiss! Come on, I love you, Ryoko! Don't you know how much I
    love you! Ryoko! Don't leave me here!
    *Tenchi's cries for help fall on deaf ears as the world collapses
    around him and kills him.*

3)  <Ryoko> Aeka... Tenchi isn't going to come back.
    <Aeka> I know, Ryoko... oh well he wasn't that great a guy anyways.
    <Ryoko> Yeah I know what you mean. I mean look at us? Fighting over
    that little man?
    <Aeka> Oh you're absolutely right, Ryoko. You know to tell you the
    truth... well I've always really had a crush on you, not Tenchi.
    <Ryoko> Oh Aeka! I've felt the same way!
    *Aeka and Ryoko embrace and start kissing.*
    <Tenchi> Hey wait a minute, what are you two doing! You're supposed
    to be trying to save me! I don't want to get stuck in here with
    that old witch!
    <Ryoko> Sorry Tenchi you had your chance. I've found someone
    better.
    <Aeka> Yes Tenchi go back into your little world with that
    Belldandy woman.
    <Tenchi> First of all she's Haruna, and second of all I don't want
    to get stuck here!
    <Ryoko> Well you should've thought of that before you slept with
    her.
    <Tenchi> It wasn't my choice! Honest! Hell it wasn't even my body!
    You have the script you know that! It'll be revealed in a few
    scenes!
    <Aeka> Oh yeah, we've heard that before. Goodbye, Tenchi. Don't
    bother to write.
    *Aeka and Ryoko walk off holding each others' hands as Tenchi
    continues to scream for help.*

2)  *Tenchi and Ryoko are sitting together near the end of the movie*
    <Tenchi> Ryoko...
    <Ryoko> Yes, Tenchi?
    <Tenchi> I was thinking... this ending really blows, doesn't it?
    <Ryoko> Yeah I guess it was kind of a major screw job now wasn't
    it?
    <Tenchi> Well why don't we give everyone a much better ending.
    *Ryoko and Tenchi embrace and start kissing. Tenchi starts to take
    Ryoko's clothes off. Suddenly a man in a suit and tie with a
    briefcase comes running in.*
    <AIC Lawyer> Now hold it right there! You two stop! If you give the
    fans what they want, we may not be able to milk this series off for
    another 10 years.
    *Ryoko proceeds to throw a energy ball at the lawyer. Tenchi and
    Ryoko continue to remove each others' clothes.*

1)  *Haruna wakes up in her futon and looks over to see...*
    <Haruna> Wait a minute, you're not Tenchi! Who did I bring in here?
    <Dr. Clay> Hello, young lady. Would you care to be a part of my
    experiments?
    *Dr. Clay proceeds to start to move on top of her.*
    <Haruna> NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!


Author's Notes : What in the world possessed me to write this? I have
no idea. No, seriously, I just wanted to have a little fun and thought
it would be entertaining. Would these actually make the movie better?
You be the judge...
