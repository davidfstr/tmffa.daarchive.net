Diclaimer- I don't own any of these characters except Ryu. That is my pen
name, not a video game character! Now that the disclaimer is out of the way,
enjoy!^_^
P.S.- And to the original author of this fic, nothing personal. Your fic is
just a test subject for when I MST the lemons and whatnot that REALLY need a
good bashing.
**********************************************************************

           Ryu was inside his laboratory area of his ship, activating a
machine that transports other people from other worlds.

Ryu: "One flick of the switch annnnd".....
(flicks the switch)
Vegeta appears.

Vegeta: "Huh?! Where the hell am I"?!
Ryu: "You are in my MST'ing station"!
Vegeta: "Not one of these damn things again! Why do I always get put in
other peoples MST's"!!!
Ryu: "You'll find out in a minute".
(Flicks switch again)
Kiyone appears.

Kiyone: "Wh..h. what the hell happened"?!(looks at Ryu) "Dammit!!! I'm in a
MST'ing station"!!!
Ryu: "Just one more"!
(Flicks switch)
Jesse, James, and Meowth appear.

Jesse: "Where are we"?
James: "I don't know".
Meowth: (pointing to Ryu). "Let's ask that creep"!
Ryu: "I will be glad to answer all of your questions. I am Ryu, a MST'er.
You are all going to be MST'ers"!
James: "What's a MST"?
Jessie: "And how do you pronounce it"?

Ryu explains what a MST is.

Meowth: "So all we gotta do is make fun of other peoples work"?
Ryu:(Nods).
Jessie: "That sounds like fun"!
James: "Putting other people down is our specialty"!
Vegeta: "It's not as glamorous as you might think".
James: "How so"?

Vegeta explains about lemons.

Jessie: "That doesn't sound too bad".
Meowth: "Except for the OOC part".
Kiyone: "Oh yeah? Try Sasami lemons".
Jessie+James: (shudder).
Meowth: "We're not going to do one of those are we"?
Ryu: "I'm afraid so".
Jessie: "What sick author would do something like that"!?
Vegeta: "A large amount I'm afraid".
Jessie: "That's it MST boy"!
Ryu: "Boy?! I'm 21 for crying out loud"!!
James: "We're not sticking around for this one"!
Kiyone: ("They obviously don't know of the limitless power a MST author
has").
Meowth: "You messed with the wrong villians! Hit it"!!

Spotlight goes on Team rocket.

Jessie: "Prepare for trouble"!
James: "Yes, and make it double"!
Kiyone:(To Ryu): "Aren't you going to shut them up before they recite that
stupid motto"?
Ryu: "Nah, I don't get tired of hearing it".
Vegeta: ("This guy must be nuts")!

Jessie: "Don't Interrupt! Now, as I was saying, 'To protect the world from
devastation'"!
James: "To unite all peoples within our nation"!
Jessie: "To denounce the evils of truth and love"!
James: "To extend our reach to the stars above"!
Jessie: "JESSIE"!!
James:"JAMES"!
Jessie: "Team rocket blasts off with the speed of light"!
James: "Surrender now or prepare to fight"!
Meowth: "MEEOWTH!! That's right"!

Jessie: Arbok! Go!!
James: Wheezing! Go!!

Nothing comes out of their pokeballs. The pokeballs return to them.

Jessie+James: O_O!
Ryu:" Don't bother! If you could do any damage here, Vegeta would have
already destroyed this place".
Vegeta: "He's right you know".
Jessie+James: "Damn"!
Meowth: "Oh well. Why did you pick us anyway"?
Ryu: "Well, I picked Vegeta because he is a MST veteran. He even MST'd
"Tenchi on a plate of Shashimi".
James: "What's that"?
Vegeta: "Trust me. Be glad that you didn't".
Ryu: I picked Kiyone because she is a Tenchi insider. She can probably give
us the best Tenchi opinions".
Meowth: Yeah, that and you like her".
Ryu: (while blushing) "Just for that, you have projection duty"!
Kiyone: "Don't worry. It's not as bad as it sounds".
Ryu: (shakes off the embarrassment)" I picked you three to get a villians
opinion. And since you guys might go for tasteless lemons, I picked you.
Jessie:  "Well, doing evil is our middle name"!
Meowth: "I thought it was loser and dimwit".

Meowth is instantly smashed by Jessie and James fists.

Meowth: Meeouchh!!!
Ryu:  "We've wasted enough time! Meowth! Into the projection booth! Everyone
else, follow me"!

They follow, and the doors lock behind them.

Jessie: "What the hell"?!
Kiyone: "It's to keep us from escaping".
James: "But I don't wanna stick around"!
Ryu: "Stop whining! Be glad I'm suffering with you"!
Meowth: (from projection booth) "I found the tape! Everybody take your
seats"!

Everyone sits in 5 chairs. Kiyone on the left, Ryu next to her, Vegeta in
the middle, Jessie next to him, and James on the right.

Ryu: "Just one final note. Escape is impossible, there are sick bags in case
you need them, and insult as freely as you wish".
Vegeta: "Good! Now shut the hell up! The fics starting"!

The lights turn off an the fic begins.

<U>James</U>: "How the hell do you pronounce that"?

<U>Ryu</U>: "Don't sound ignorant James".

  As I'm sure we all know, I don't own Tenchi Muyo

<U>Kiyone</U>: "Wow. You think"?!

  All rights belong to the original

A Family Affair: Reflections in the Night

Tenchi Muyo Fanfiction by Kaitouace



*********************************************************************

It was a normal day at the Masaki household......

<U>Kiyone</U>: "What's he talking about?! It's never a normal day there"!

Well actually not really.  It was rather quiet.  Tenchi was out in
the garden and Ryo-oh-ki tagged along with him.  Washu was in her
lab as usual.  Ryoko and Aeka apparently took their constant fight
outside for the time being.  Kiyone and Mihoshi hadn't invited
themselves over for lunch.  Nobuyuki was still at work and Katsuhito
was at the temple.  And......

<U>All</U>: "Aaanndddd...."

for one glorious moment, Sasami wasn't
working.  She had the house all to herself and was sprawled on the
couch watching television.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "I don't like the direction this is heading".

Lately Sasami had taken a fancy to old style family programming.

<U>Ryu</U>: (As a commercial speaker)"Next episode of the Masaki house,

Tenchi learns the way of the pedophile".

 It
reminded her of her own semi-adoptive family.  They were always
involved in strange adventures but always seemed to solve whatever
problems they had and went back to normal.  Sometimes as quickly as
......well...a half hour.

<U>Kiyone</U>: "Let's not forget the usual space pirates, the normal Jurian

princesses, two GP officers, some life threatening event happening

daily...

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Alright,alright! We get the point"!

        "Bobby, I'm scared of the thunder.  Can I sleep with you?"

        "Sure sis.  Hop in."

<U>James</U>: "I can't believe I'm watching this crap".

Sasami sighed to herself.  It'd be nice to have a family like that.

<U>Jessie</U>:(as Sasami)"But instead I'm a Jurian princess waiting to be

molested in a bad lemon".

<U>Ryu</U>: "That really didn't need to be said".

But with "her" family.......but then again.  There was always
Tenchi.  He was as close to a brother as she had.  Not counting
Yosho, of course.

<U>Ryu</U>: "Now THAT really didn't need to be said".

  Not to mention he WAS the most normal member of
the household.  It was HIS household after all.

<U>Kiyone</U>:(as Nobuyuki)"And who the hell am I"?

  Sasami wondered
to herself.

        "Would he mind?  Just this once?"

<U>Vegeta</U>: "I really don't like where this is going".

Sasami blushed at the idea but soon sighed in defeat.  She couldn't
ask Tenchi that.  She'd never have the nerve.

<U>Ryu</U>: "You won't need it. He'll do it for you".

        "I love you Bobby."

        "I love you too."

<U>Ryu</U>: "I love you Kiyone".

<U>Kiyone</U>: "I love you t..HEY"!!

        [TV Audience] "Awwwww...."

<U>Vegeta</U>: "How corny"!

........But then again......maybe she did.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "But she found out that she was in a bad lemon and killed
Tenchi,then herself. The end".

<U>Ryu</U>: "That was pretty dark Vegeta".

Tenchi came in from the vegetable garden with Ryo-oh-ki close
behind nipping at the basket he was carrying.

<U>Jessie</U>: "How is that possible to come IN from the vegetable garden?
Shouldn't it be FROM and that's it"?

<U>Ryu</U>: "From from the vegetable garden".

<U>Jessie</U>:"Shut up"!

        "Tenchi-niichan, Ryo-oh-chan....welcome home."

Tenchi smiled as Ryo-oh-ki left the basket and took her usual
position perched on Sasami's head.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Which she then crapped on".

        "Hi Sasami-chan.  What's going on?"

Sasami froze in embarrassment.  Should she ask him now?  No.  It
was a silly idea to begin with.  She should just forget it.

<U>All</U>: "Yes! End our torment"!

Tenchi saw her confusion and was generally concerned.

        "Is something wrong?"

Sasami jumped as she noticed Tenchi in her face, looking a little
worried.

<U>Ryu</U>:(as Sasami)"Mmphffff! You're smothering me Tenchi"!

        "Ohh!  Not...really.  I was just watching television."

        "....Oh.  Well I'll just put this basket in the shed then."

Tenchi shrugged the situation off and turned to leave.

<U>Kiyone</U>: "And there was much rejoicing".

<U>All</U>:"Yay".

  But before
she knew what she was doing, Sasami spoke quickly.

<U>All</U>:"Damn"!

        "Tenchi-niichan!"

She couldn't believe she was doing this.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Neither could we"!

  Even her sister didn't
have the courage to ask this blatantly.  But her mind was thinking
to itself as her mouth continued unabated.

        "Ummm.....we're practically family, right?"

<U>Ryu</U>:"That depends on which series this is based on".

Tenchi thought for a second, then answered.

        "Yeah.  We are related by blood, right?  I forget.  It's REAL
confusing.  We're siblings or are you my niece or.....?"

Tenchi stood lost in thought as he tried to create the entire Jurai
family tree in his head.  He never really thought about it before
but it was pretty interesting, if totally incomprehensible.
Sasami stood patiently but suddenly she blurted out her request,
knocking Tenchi out of his endless mental trip of his own genealogy.

<U>Ryu</U>: "Brain..spinning..trying to..untangle..clover leaf..family tree".

        "Well.....I was wondering if just once......"

<U>Kiyone</U>: (as Sasami)"That I don't have to be in a lemon"?
<U>Ryu</U>: (as Tenchi)"Fat chance Sasami! You're mine"!

Tenchi stared at Sasami, wondering what was on her mind.  He didn't
have long to wait, however."

        "...Could I sleep with you?!?!

<U>All</U>: "Noooooooooo"!!!!!!!!

  But I know you don't want to
and it's OK but you're like my brother and brothers and sisters
sleep together sometimes at least on TV and I thought it would be
nice and actually forget what I said.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Damn! I hate run on sentences".

<U>Ryu</U>: "Screw the run on! I hate how she said that"!

<U>Jessie</U>: "Ironic choice of words,especially for a lemon".

  I have cooking to do and
I'm sorry I brought it up and........"

        "Sasami-chan."

Tenchi put a hand on her shoulder and she jumped.  She slowly
opened her eyes, which were shut the whole time and saw a smiling
Tenchi.  Her wonderful brother.

<U>James</U>: "I see an incorrect punctuation".

        "I understand.  It's no problem.  Really."

<U>Ryu</U>:(as Tenchi)"Now get out of here before I jump your bones"!
(A large mallet smacks Ryu).

<U>Kiyone</U>: "That's for giving me that horrible image"!

Sasami's mind slowly processed his answer and jumped for joy.  Her
face beamed brightly and she was about to leap into Tenchi's arms
when Tenchi's face became very serious surprising her.

<U>Ryu</U>: (as Tenchi)"I warned you".

        "Sasami-chan.  You have to promise me one thing."

<U>Vegeta</U>: (as Tenchi)"Let me be on top"!
(A large mallet smacks Vegeta).

Sasami saw the look on Tenchi's face and became nervous.

        "Wh...what is it?"

Tenchi's frown turned back into a smile.

        "Don't let your sister know."

<U>Jessie</U>: (as Tenchi)"I could get jailed for years and end up as Bubbas
bitch".(A large mallet smacks her).

<U>Kiyone</U>:"Stop picking on Tenchi"!

Tenchi laughed a bit and Sasami followed suit.  She relaxed as she
had a request of her own.

        "You just make sure Ryoko-oneechan doesn't find out."

They laughed again but for some reason that comment filled Tenchi
with a small sense of dread.

<U>James</U>: "Then Ryoko killed everybody. The end"!
<U>Meowth</U>: "You don't get out of it that easy"!
<U>Ryu+Vegeta+Jessie</U>: "My head hurts".

        "Wow Sasami-chan!  What a huge dinner!  It's more.......than a
man like me deserves...."

<U>Ryu</U>: (as Nobuyuki)"And... also...forgive...my...speech...im...pe...



di...men...t.

Nobuyuki barely managed to finish his sentence before bursting into
tears.  He was as impressed as everyone else.  Sasami was a very good
cook but the feast that was laid before the family took them all
completely off-guard.  Even Katsuhito was impressed.

<U>Ryu</U>: "What's the big deal? Sasami always cooks dinner. Everyone always
says it's good. I hate redundance"!

<U>Kiyone</U>: "If you had someone to do your cooking for you,would you

complain"?

<U>Ryu</U>:"Good point".

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Slave drivers"!

        "I agree.  You've outdone yourself today Sasami-chan.  What's
the occasion?"

        "......Huh?  OH!"

Sasami was surprised by the question.  She had been thinking about
Tenchi nonstop since their talk.

        "Ummm....no reason.  Really.  I...I just felt like it."

<U>James</U>: "Nice coverup".

Sasami blushed to herself as Ryoko spoke through mouthfuls of food.

        "WELL.....I wish you felt like it more often."

Tenchi shook at the comment and tried to speak but was too late as
Aeka chimed in determined to embarrass the space pirate.

<U>All</U>:(making chiming noises).

        "Please Ryoko-san.  Could you be just a BIT more polite at the
table?  Some of us are trying to eat."

Ryoko didn't appreciate the attack on her somewhat questionable
eating habits.

        "Mind your own business you old maid."

        "................WHAT DID YOU CALL ME!!!!!"

<U>Kiyone</U>: (as Ryoko)"Sorry. I meant to say flat chested old maid."
<U>Jessie</U>: "Why would you say something like that"?

<U>Meowth</U>: (from PB)"She's just saying that because she's smaller than Ryoko".

<U>Jessie</U>: (yelling)"IF YOU WEREN'T IN THERE I'D KILL YOU FOR THAT REMARK"!

<U>Meowth</U>: (from PB)"But you can't, so nya-nyaaa"!!

Aeka had had enough as she slammed her hands on the table and rose to
her feet.  Now it was Ryoko's turn as she smirked at the angry
princess.

        "Ohhhhh.....want another lesson in humility I see."

      "The one who needs an education is YOU!"

<U>Ryu</U>: (as Ryoko)"I already gots an edumacation. I gradeeated
from Devry".

Tenchi sighed to himself as he slowly ducked for cover.  The others
followed suit.

<U>James</U>:"What type? Leather? Armoni"?

  But Sasami wasn't paying attention.  She was too
excited about what was to come.  She just sat and stared into space
even as her carefully cooked meal flew past her in handfuls.

        *SIGH*  "I can't wait."

<U>Kiyone</U>: (as Sasami)"But first I have to clean up after these pigs".
<U>Ryu</U>: "Yep. That's one hell of a mess".

Aeka had finally fallen asleep.  Sasami had thought she would never
be able to get past her without waking her.  She quietly got out of
her futon on the floor and headed for the door.  As she passed her
sister she heard mumblings of Tenchi-sama.  Sasami couldn't help but
giggle to herself.

        "Boy.  Oneesama would sure be jealous."

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Goodbye Sasami".

Sasami stood there for a second thinking about the irony of the
situation before she remembered why she was awake in the first place
and swiftly left the room.

<U>Ryu</U>: "I'm gonna let that one pass. Too easy".

Tenchi laid in bed deep in thought.  He knew Sasami was on the way.
But, as expected, he was having second thoughts.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Good! Then he still has some morals".
<U>Kiyone</U>: "I would'nt count on it".

        "I hope she doesn't get the wrong idea or anything."

Tenchi was pondering the situation with all the indecisiveness he
could muster.  But even he soon dismissed the idea as silly.

<U>Ryu</U>:(as Tenchi)"You're dismissed silly".
<U>Vegeta</U>:"Bad joke Ryu".

        "No.  She just sees me as a big brother and big brothers sleep
with their little sisters from time to time.  Besides, it might be
fun.  Having someone to talk to for a bit......huh?"

Tenchi's thoughts were interrupted when he heard a quiet knock on
the door.

        "Ummm.....Tenchi-niichan?"

        "It's open.  Come on in Sasami-chan."

<U>Kiyone</U>: "And the bad lemon scene begins".

Sasami slowly walked in and Tenchi was a bit surprised by her
wardrobe.

<U>James</U>:"It better not be what I'm thinkng".

        "I didn't know they had pajamas in Jurai."

Sasami was wearing light blue pajamas with large carrots strewn about
them.

<U>All</U>:"Phew"!

        "Of course we do silly.  Besides, this way it's more like a
sleepover type party."

Tenchi didn't exactly make a habit out of peeking into peoples rooms
but he knew that Aeka usually wore strange outfits to bed.  He was
sure it was just normal Jurai clothing but he expected Sasami to be
wearing something similar......more alien.  But seeing her look so
normal......so cute......

He shook the images out of his head as he realized Sasami was staring
at him confused.

<U>Ryu</U>:(as Tenchi)"Oops! I'm talking to myself out loud again".

  He shrugged it off and moved over a bit.  Sasami
slowly climbed in the bed and sat.  She was still quite nervous.  She
caught their reflection in a mirror and couldn't believe it.  It was
like watching someone else on television.

<U>Jessie</U>: "I thought this was just a fic"?

<U>Ryu</U>:"It is. They don't mean us".

<U>Kiyone</U>:"Wait a mminute! There isn't supposed to be a mirror in there"?!

  She quickly turned to
Tenchi with an odd question.

<U>Kiyone</U>:(as Sasami)"Are we being watched"?

        "Tenchi-niichan, I'm scared of the thunder.  Can I sleep with
you tonight?"

Now it wasn't raining and Tenchi was obviously confused.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Good. Then it's not just me".

<U>Jessie</U>:"I can't believe the author had her use that corny line".

  However,
the look on Sasami's face brought a smile to his lips and he gave his
answer.

        "Sure.  Hop in."

Sasami's face lit up and she hugged her brother tightly.

<U>Ryu</U>:"Must...keep...sanity"!
<U>Kiyone</U>:"What's wrong"?
<U>Ryu</U>:"Bad...lemon...coming..up"!
<U>Kiyone</U>:"Must...keep...sanity"!

After talking for a bit, Sasami became tired and soon fell asleep.
Tenchi covered her small body with the blanket and started to turn
his back to her.  But before he had the chance, Sasami shoved into
him and snuggled close.  He wasn't quite expecting this and was
taken by surprise.  At this angle he looked over Sasami's back at
his mirror so he could see her face.

        "......So peaceful.  Well, best not to disturb her."

<U>Vegeta</U>:"<cough>BULLSHIT<cough>"!

He draped his arm over her and slowly drifted to sleep.......or so he
thought.  Tenchi was afraid of this.  He was a bit.....uncomfortable
with this situation.  He WAS a young man after all and couldn't
really completely ignore the young girl in his bed.

<U>Jessie</U>:"I will not sit here and watch this! This is bullshit"!

<U>Vegeta</U>:"You don't have much of a choice".

  Of course he
wasn't thinking anything perverted but it would be mighty
embarrassing if Sasami was woken up by a certain.....poking in her
back.

<U>Ryu</U>:"That last sentencce turned the first one into bullshit".

<U>Kiyone</U>:"How could you tell? It was another run on"!

  So Tenchi once again tried to turn his back to her.  But once
again Sasami's position restricted his movement.  But Tenchi was
determined.  He managed to move his arm and get to his back.

        "Halfway there."

<U>All</U>:"Keep going".

Sasami felt the lack of warmth and unconsciously reached back,
grabbing Tenchi's hand.  She brought it all the way back over her and
held it fast.  Instead of having his arm removed from his socket,
Tenchi had no choice but to reluctantly move back to his original
and now even closer position.

<U>Kiyone</U>:"That is the biggest load of"..
<U>All but Kiyone</U>:"We know,we know".

After relaxing again, Tenchi felt something different.  Apparently
all that shuffling shifted the position of Sasami's top and his hand
was being held on her bare stomach.  Tenchi immediately tried to move
his hand but Sasami's grip remained firm.  He pulled a bit harder but
things went from bad to worse.  Sasami lost her grip but caught it
once again.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"What a wuss".

  But in trying to escape, Tenchi's hand caught her top
bringing the front almost to her neck.  His hand was right below her
small breasts.

Tenchi was at a loss.  He couldn't stay like THAT.

<U>Ryu</U>:"And he damn well better not"!

  He caught another
glance in the mirror and looked at her cute face.  Her small chest
going in and out.  Her tiny breasts moving up and down.  Up and down.
Up and......

        "....NO!  What am I THINKING?!?  I'm no pedophile!"

<U>Vegeta</U>:""Could've fooled us"!

Tenchi's mind blared at him shaking him out of his trance.  He
decided to wake Sasami up and ask her to leave.....or at least change
position.....or at least......

But before he knew it, he was watching his reflection.....as it
slowly slid it's hand under Sasami's shirt.  He was mesmerized by the
sight.  It was like it wasn't him but he could still feel it.  Sasami
sharply caught her breath but settled back into sleep.  Tenchi then
slowly cupped her breast, her tiny nipple between his middle and
index finger.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"I'll kill that sick pervert"!!

<U>James</U>:"This is low,even for us"!

  Carefully he moved it around causing Sasami to moan
incoherently in her sleep.  He closed his fingers slightly and she
moaned louder as it stiffened in Tenchi's grasp.  Tenchi unknowing
smiled to himself as he caressed Sasami's lithe body.  After a few
minutes of this, Tenchi couldn't help but turn his attention
elsewhere.

<U>Ryu</U>:"STOP THE FIC!! STOP THE FIC"!!
<U>Meowth</U>:"You aint getting out of this,MST writer"!

<U>Ryu</U>:"What the hell is wrong with your pokemon Jessie"?!

<U>Jessie</U>:"Unfortunately,he's not ours,and he's kind of a sadist".

<U>Ryu</U>:"I should have never given him projection duty".

But that would be going TOO far as Tenchi's mind once again tried to
be the voice of reason.  But Tenchi seemed lost in the illusion of
the mirror.  He removed his hand from her breast and slowly slid it
down to the waist of her pajama bottom.  He took his finger and
slowly lifted the waistband.  Sasami squirmed for a second and
Tenchi froze.

<U>Kiyone</U>:"MAKE IT STOP!!MAKE IT STOP"!!

  She soon settled down however and Tenchi moved on.  He
deftly inserted his hand and felt the softness of Sasami's panties.
He sighed at the warm feeling.  Tenchi gently cupped the crotch and
Sasami squealed softly.  He then very softly and carefully rubbed
his middle finger back and forth across the center of Sasami's
panties tickling her virgin girlhood.  At this point Sasami didn't
seem to respond but began breathing much heavier.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"As soon as I get out of here,I'm killing this author"!
<U>Kiyone</U>:"Tenchi is NOT a pedophile"!!

Tenchi, now fully engulfed by the beautiful body next to him,
basically had no choice but to break the final barrier.  He wanted,
no needed, full contact.  He slowly lifted his hand and brought it
back to the top of Sasami's panties which he now noticed were
slightly damp.  He took his fingers and carefully slid his hand into
her panties while moving his hips back as to not have his now large
erection thrust into Sasami's rear.

<U>James</U>:"Now he's raping her! I'll kill the  bastard"!

<U>Kiyone</U>:"I've got dibs on him first"!

<U>James</U>:"I was talking about the author".

<U>Kiyone</U>:"So was I".

  His index finger started to
work around as it felt the outer lips of Sasami's nether region.
Tenchi then ran his finger along the thin slit in the middle causing
Sasami to shudder.  But at this point, he was hardly paying
attention.

Tenchi didn't know too much about the female anatomy but had heard
rumors of a small nub just below the surface that was supposed to
bring women to ecstasy.  He desperately wanted to touch it but that
wouldn't be possible unless.......

<U>Jessie</U>:"Does the author have some sort of sick pedophile fantasy"?
<U>Ryu</U>:"Who knows Jessie, who knows".

After a second of thought,

<U>Ryu</U>: "How many second thoughts was that so far"?

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Actually, this is a second OF thought".

 Tenchi took his middle and ring fingers
and slowly parted Sasami.  He was ready for the final step of his
erotic journey when he glanced into the mirror one last time.....and
froze.

<U>Ryu</U>: "Someone shot him with liquid nitrogen".

  The slim stomach, the long legs, the pert breasts, the
slowly quivering crotch......all this vanished.  All he could see was
Sasami's large pinkish eyes as they started back at him, cutting him
to his very soul.  Tears started to form from them but she held them
back trying to remain as emotionless as possible.

<U>All</U>:"BUSTED"!!!

        "....Stop........please."

<U>Kiyone</U>:"She took the words right out of my mouth"!
<U>Jessie</U>: "I thought your words were shoot his balls off".

<U>Kiyone</U>: "That too".

Her timid voice seemed like a frantic scream in the dark room.
Tenchi was shaking.

<U>James</U>:"Into a convulsion, killing him".

  He couldn't believe what he had just done.  In
his fear he forgot where his hand was and slightly brushed Sasami's
insides with his middle finger.  She gasped as her eyes turned from
emotionless to frightened.  Tenchi quickly removed his hand and let
go of her.  She laid there for a moment but soon stood up and
adjusted her clothes.

        "I'm sorry Tenchi-niichan.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"For what"?!!!

  I shouldn't have asked to do this.
It's all my fault.  I....I better go back to my room."

<U>Ryu</U>:"I'm not sure on how to comment on that".
<U>Kiyone</U>:"Simple! This author needs serious help"!

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Why is Sasami blaming herself?! Shouldn't she be telling Ryoko

to kill Tenchi"?!

<U>James</U>: "That's your answer to everything".

<U>Vegeta</U>:"And your point is"?

<U>Ryu</U>:"Sorry James. But I agree with Vegeta on this one".

<U>Kiyone</U>: "I second that".

<U>Jessie</U>:"I third it"

<U>Meowth</U>: "I fourth it, if that IS such a word".

<U>James</U>:"Hmm,Good point! Let's kill Tenchi,and then torture the author"!

Sasami slowly walked to the door and stopped.  Waiting for Tenchi to
say something.  Something to make it all right like he always did.
But there was only silence.  Tenchi wanted to speak, to move, to cry
and beg for forgiveness.  But he did nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
All he could do was watch as Sasami drooped her head as she opened
the door and left the room.  Tenchi just lay there in the darkness.
Just him, his reflection, and his shame.

<U>Ryu</U>:"At least he's not making excuses for himself".

*********************************************************************

<U>Kiyone</U>: "A page break! YESS!!!

Kaitouace here.  THAT'S a different kind of lemon.

<U>Ryu</U>:"I'll give him credit on that one".

  Written because
I HATE TENCHI!  The character, not the show.

<U>Kiyone</U>:"If Tenchi was like how the author wrote him, I'd hate him too"!
<U>Ryu</U>: "Remember. He was OOC".

<U>Kiyone</U>"Then why does he hate him"?!

<U>James</U>:"I think the author has issues".

Anyhow I hope you liked it.

<U>Meowth</U>:"Which we didn't"!

  This is my 3rd overall story with a
Card Captor Sakura and Pokemon being one and two respectively.  If
anyone has any comments, questions, or criticism please email me
at:

kaitouace@hotmail.com

<U>Kiyone</U>:"I hope his other stories aren't as bad as this one".

















<U>Vegeta</U>: "I doubt it".

Be warned.  I'm a friendly guy and WILL respond to your emails.
EVERY one.

<U>Meowth</U>:"I wonder if he'll respond to this MST"?

<U>Ryu</U>:"Who knows Meowth, who knows".

  People seem to be surprised when I answer.

<U>James</U>:"I'm not".

  Usually on
the same day too.

<U>Jessie</U>:"Now that IS surprising"!

  And if you have flames and you have a reasonable
argument, go ahead and be torn to shreds by my logic.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Bring it on"!!

  Or maybe I'll
ignore you.  Who knows.

<U>Vegeta</U>:"Wuss"!

  Well, see you next time.

P.S.  I wrote this out of spite for Tenchi

<U>Kiyone</U>:(sarcastically)"Really? You could've fooled me".

 but I AM considering
adding another part to it

<U>All</U>:"NOOOOOOO"!!!!!!!!!

 to "make it all better."

<U>James</U>:"I wonder what he means by that"?

<U>Ryu</U>:"I don't know? Maybe he's gonna kill Tenchi or something".

  Lemon action may
or may not be involved.

<U>Kiyone</U>:"We pray for the latter".

  If you want a happy ending, let me know and
maybe I'll swallow my pride and let Tenchi off the hook.

<U>Vegeta</U>: "Actually, we could care less. We just want this to end".

  Or I might
just kill him.  Heh.

<U>Ryu</U>:"Do I call it or what"!

         (Film turns off,lights come back on,and the doors unlock).

(In lobby)

<U>Ryu</U>:"Okay, it's overall review time"!

James: "It wasn't a total flop. At least it was dark".
Kiyone: "And at least Sasami didn't enjoy it".
Vegeta: "It's still getting a bad review! It was a Sasami lemon"!
Jessie: "Very true, but it could have been worse".
Vegeta: "I guess you're right, it could have been the erotic torture
chamber"!
Ryu: "I guess I was a bit hard on the author, but I HATE Sasami lemons"!
(All nod in agreement).

Ryu: "I purposely let you guys review a mild lemon, cause the next one might
be horrible".
(All but Ryu)O_O!
Meowth:  "When are we going home"?!
Ryu: "Think about it Meowth. If we don't MST, bad fanfics will go
unpunished"!
Kiyone:"Whaaatttt???!!!!! In that case, I'm staying"!
Vegeta: "I guess I'll stay as well. Without me, you wusses won't last long"!
Jessie:"That changes nothing! If we stay here, then that twerp will get away
with that Pikachu"!
James:"And we'll lose our jobs"!
Ryu:"Don't worry. Time is frozen in the MST'ing zone".
Meowth: "In that case, I guess we "could" stay a bit longer".
Jessie: "Yeah, and it sure beats walking all the time".
James: "Not to mention always atarving".
Vegeta: "Speaking of which, where's your cafeteria"?
Ryu: "Thanks for reminding me Vegeta. On this ship, we get all the food,
rest, and entertainment we want"!
Kiyone: "What about hygene"?
Ryu: "Consider it taken care of".
Kiyone: "All right"!!!

  (Everyone heads to the cafeteria)

     END OF MST
***********************************************************************

So, how did you like it? It was my first MST, so I'll only get better with
experience. Sends your questions, comments, suggestions, or complaints to
rubynall@hotmail.com
I only MST bad fanfics, so don't expect to see any good fics MST'd. I hope I
have enough experience to tackle on a REALLY bad fic, since this one was a
little mild, but I still don't like Sasami lemons. If you want us to MST
chapter 2 of "A Family Affair", let me know. And remember, flames count as a
yes, so don't send any.
One more thing. To the original author, if you're reading this, do us all a
favor by not writing any more Sasami lemons.
