Ryoko
By The Unknown DJ

(A familiar figure approaches the mike. He pulls out a piece of paper.)

The Unknown DJ: I will now play.

(The Unknown DJ pulls out his acoustic guitar and plays. Then, he
sings.)

Verse 1

Ryoko wants a cookie
But Aeka ate them all
She probley needs some sake
To hide the emotion in her heart

Chorus

It's Tenchi
Who you need
You have to tell him
You have this thing
I can only tell you
Not to hurt yourself
Tenchi needs your help
To help himself
You got to tell him
'Fore it's too late
An' I promise you
He will be true
I can only tell you
Not to hurt yourself
Tenchi needs your help
To help himself

Verse 2

Ryoko wants a cookie
Maybe she won't be crude
She needs to get Tenchi
A chase for him would be nice too

Repeat Chorus

Interlude

Ryoko Wants

Verse 3

Ryoko says her heart aches
She's just as sad as me
I wish she could find someone
Or finally admit her love for Tenchi

Repeat Chorus

        This Song is to the tune of the Nirvana song, "Polly." They write
it,
so don't sue the DJ. I just thought it would be nice to do. Watch for
more Song Fics and possible recordings of me singing them. E-mail me at
theunknowndjendz@yahoo.com. Peace out.
