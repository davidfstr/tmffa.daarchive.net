The dark chair slowly turns, revealing a surprisingly handsome and humble (heh) otaku.  “This isn’t my private hell anymore I’m sharing it with 3 other people.”  Some cackling occurs.  “Well let’s start, shall we?”

                          CHAPTER 3: THE EROTIC TORTURE CHAMBER

(Washu's lab)
Click, click, click,click, went the sound of Washu's wooden sole shoe's
as
she crept down the stone hallway lite by torches wich lead down to her sex
prison. 
Noin:You’d think she would have better lighting
Tenchi:Evidently she spent all her money of the sex prison
Ryoko:Money? what money she just steals everything

She had a large narrow hallway with hundreds of prisoners in their
prison cells. Some still screeming, moaning, and holding wounds of places on
their body particularly private places on their body, 

All:OWWWWW

where the terrible Washu has sexuality assulted them in some bondage torture way...

M:Let’s leave it at that and end the fic
Noin:Yeah
Ryoko:Whooooo hoooo

The prisoners only knew that trecherous sound as the demond lady Washu creeping down the stairs. The knocking of the shoes on the stone floor only meant a few things
for the prisoners...Washu was horney, 

M:I have no idea what I would do if I was horney, horny though...
Noin:Stop making jokes at the typos else we will be here all day
Tenchi:I hope to hell not

and she would slowly walk down the hall looking in each cell to see who would be next. Who would be the next to endure Washu's sexual tasks and tortures. 

M:hmm we’re being tortured now

On the first level stood cells of peoplewho were to be or that had not been tortured yet. On the second level, stood the people who were already tortured and will be tortured some more.

Tenchi:See I’d marry you, but normal inlaws are hard enough to deal with.
Ryoko:For the 3,826 time (roughly) MY MOM IS NOT LIKE THAT!

43% of the victims were women, and 57% were men. They were nothing to Washu. Merely test subjects...people who were there to serve the purpose of finding out
what sexually torments and tortures people to the full extent, the hard way.

M:So what’s the easy way?
Noin:Anything has to be better than this

"Oops! silly me...I almost forgot my crown"said Washu.

Washu always kept a special crown on her head at all times. A sort of
symbolic thing which presented her as a woman with power. The crown was
platnium, with large diamonds surrounding it. She snapped her fingers and
her special crown appeared on her head.

M:Of course is was so heavy is broke her neck and she died, thus ending the fic
Tenchi:You know that never works
M:Can’t hurt to try can it?

"Hehehehe, this is such a rush!" <click, click,click> "Hmmmmm, who's next?"
<Click, click, click.> ' I think i'll give the already tortured people a break and move on to the fresh meat!"

Noin:Meat isn’t some sort of bad sex pun?
M:Let is be written that Noin said that and not me

Washu made her way through the "fresh meat" section.

" I choooooosssseeee....................YOU!!!!!"

M:Ahhh Pokemon, kill it, kill it.
Noin:Why Pokemon are kinda cute...
M:I kill cute

Washu pointed at a 30 year old white woman who's utter most fear of Washu
greatly influenced Washu's descision. 

M:No come back Pokemon don’t leave us with Washu
Ryoko:K you are scaring me...
M:I scare a lot of people that’s why they’re all dead... all of them...
The rest slowly edge away from Mchan

Tears rolled down the womans naked dehydrated body. 

Tenchi:So was she crying from every pore in her body...
Ryoko:Either that or her tear ducts don’t work

Washu had checked the womens file....It said that she's a former super model with no criminal record. The woman had brown eye's and blonde hair, about 5'7.Washu licked her lips with anticipation and slowly walked towards the victim. only screems could be heard from  the other prisoners as they were blind folded and had to perfect their hearing to know what was going on.

M:Did that make sense to anyone
Ryoko:Do lemons ever?
All:No

(TENCHI'S ROOM, MORNING AFTER THEIR BIG NITE)

Tenchi and Ryouko both wake up at the same time.

M:Tenchi of course seeing Ryouko in his bed gets a nose bleed and passes out
Ryoko:When I get my hands on this Ryouko woman...
Tenchi:I think it’s just a typo
Ryoko:Damn lucky typo
Noin:I hate this running gag can we stop?

"I-I love you Ryouko." said Tenchi, eye's half open. "Oh Tenchi....last
night was...was incredible."said Ryouko, eyes also half open. " I love
you to my Tenchi" "Hurry Ryouko, we must keep this relationship a secret,
you have to sneak back down the hall to your room before Sasami wakes up to make
breakfast." "Okay Tenchi"

Tenchi:But Ryoko never wakes up early, and Sasami is always up so early you’d think she was an insomniac
M:Can’t sleep clowns will eat me...Can’t sleep clowns will eat me...Can’t sleep clowns will...
Ryoko smacks Mchan really hard
Noin:Thank you
Ryoko:My pleasure

Ryouko got out from under the covers with absolutely nothing on.

"God she's soo hot." Tenchi thought to himself as Ryouko bent over to
pick up her clothes from the floor, giving Tenchi a great view of her sweet  firm
ass.

Noin:Why do I have the feeling that if Vegita was here he’d see if her ass was sweet and firm?
M:It is....
Mchan cannot finish since his head is in the wall after Ryoko put it there

(BREAKFAST TABLE)

Things are now even more awkward at the table than usual. A strange and
uncomfortable silence filled the air. An undescribable silence...one filled
with secrets of sin.

"The food is great Sasami" said Tenchi, trying to break the silence.
"Oh....thankyou Tenchi..." said Sasami in a very deppressed tone as she
stared at her food with a blank expression on her face. "Gee Sasami, you
haven't even touched your breakfast" said Tenchi. 

M:That’s because she secretly poisoned it so Washu would die.

"Wow Sasami, where ever did you get that awful bruise on your cheek?"said Mihoshi, who now drew all of the attention of the gang on her.

Noin:I just remember the whole Ayeka/Sasami thing.
M:Lucky you, you forget for a few blissful moments

The whole group was now staring careingly into the eye's of innocent
Sasami...Ayeka made eye contact with Sasami to find out whether or not
she's gonna squeal. Sasami looked Ayeka in the eye and almost began to cry. She
new that all she had to do was tell on her sister and she would be free and
Ayeka would probably be executed according to Jurian law when word was out. 

M:Her or Ayeka?
Noin:The author with any luck
Tenchi:The author’s a woman?
Noin:No women aren’t like that only men write this tripe
M:Hey stop insulting my gender, not all men are hentai, look at me
Ryoko:Coming from the man who checked to see if my ass was firm and sweet?
M:Hey gotta be Vegita in spirit right?

But on the other hand, Sasami was a very loving and forgiving person who did not
want to betray her sister's trust and demplimish her reputation.

M:K I won’t make fun of the typo coughdumbauthorcough

"oh uh....I slipped in the kitchen this morning....i'm...i'm okay though..." "So! Mihoshi, Kiyone, hows the police buisness going?" said Ayeka, desprately trying to change the subject.

              (FLASHBACK...FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT GET TO READ CHAP2)
M:Noo no flashbacks, I already have nightmares, nooooooo.

"Sasami, you know what time it is?!" said Ayeka with a very evil smile.

Ryoko(As Sasami):It’s 8:00 I better go brush my teeth and go to bed, see you in the morning.
M:Hey I made that similar joke last time
Ryoko:Oops sorry, forgot

Sasami almost burst into tears.

"Oh please Ayeka! not tonight...please! i beg of you!...my pussy is still
soooooo sore from the other night! please no!!!

M:Wow there’s something you don’t hear every day
Noin:Nor want to.

Ayeka grabbed Sasami by the hair and pulled her all the way down the hall to
where her room was.

"Shuddup you little bitch!" exclaimed Ayeka. " I'm really pissed off
about Lord Tenchi taking the side of that pirate tramp! and i'm gonna take it
all out on you!" "Oh Ayeka, i'm really sorry about what happened with
Tenchi but please don't do it to me tonight! PLEASE!"

Tenchi:Yes don’t
Ryoko:For all our sakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
M:Considering I MST’d this once before I’m going to skip out of the flashback
Noin:Lazy man
M:You want to see that again?
Noin:On the other hand, skip it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sasami tried all the reasoning she could to get out of her nightly chor, but
she would have to be a little more realistic, Ayeka has had an exceptionally
hard day today, and the better the day, the nicer Ayeka would take it out on
Sasami. Ayeka ripped off Sasami's clothes. That was the fifth pair she's
ripped in a week thought Sasami. But Sasami knew she had bigger things to
worry about.  Ayeka took off her own clothes and revealed the black leather
sex mistress outfit she would wear every time she tortured her sister. Ayeka
looked VERY sexy in it...her top sufficated her double D chest and her black
leather thong fit tightly around her clean shaven cunt. She also wore knee
high leather boots with red laces. Ayeka tied Sasami down to her 4 post bed
in the shape of an "X", so that Sasami's legs were wide open.

" okay Sasami, instead of the usual ducktape I have to use to shut your
little mouth, i'm gonna use the traditional ball gag."

Ayeka strapped the ball gag around Sasami's haed, wich completely muted
Sasami from trying to screem out in agonizing pain. Ayeka pulled out a wip
from her catwoman halloween costume she wore last year and began to snap it
just to intimidate Sasami. Ayeka then cocked her hand back, and lunged the
wip at sasamis bare pussy and slashed it.

"MMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNHHHHHMMMMMMOOOOOONNNNNNNN!!!!!!!"Were the only
words
that could be heard coming from Sasami's mouth. " I knew it was a good
idea
to use a ball gag this time. Sasami....you better get used to the taste of
that ball gag because your gonna be wearing it for a long time."

Ayeka did one of her loud evil annoying laughs and cracked the wip at
Sasami's pussy another 23 times.Sasami's pussy was very swollen when
Ayeka
decided to do something differen't.

"I'm not getting enough pleasure out of this!" yelled Ayeka.

At that moment, Ayeka slide off her leather panties and massaged her pussy..

"oooooooo yes! mmmmmmm yes! oooooooo baby!"

Ayeka knew she was going to cum so she stood on top of her bed hoovering
over
sasami's body and just let it all flow out on Sasami. Sasami's body was
completely drenched with liquid. Ayeka then got on top of Sasami and
slithered up and down her body so that her fluids were evenly smeard
everywhere.Blood mixed with the fluids giving Sasami a pleasent shade of
pink.

"Okay Sasami, thats enough for tonight."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(BACK AT BREAKFAST)

M:ahh back to new tripe

Everyone had finished their meal...Tenchi was off to school and Ryouko was
in the living room watching television.

"Sasami, meet me in my lab at 3:30 today, I think I might have a solution
to your problems"

M:Don’t do it
Ryoko:You’ll regret it I know you will
Noin:I feel ill, there’s another part isn’t there
M:Yes but it’s short, so we will do part four and five at once
Tenchi:Boy that’s a joy to hear
