And god said, let there be Tenchi, and so it was.

			What can I Say?
			  By Ishtaar I
***********************************************************************
I see her there beside me. Her teal tresses flow softly down her shoulders. Her firm, full figure 
radiates power. 

What can I say? 

I try to speak, but my words never come out right. I stare into her deep green eyes, and they stare 
back with such contempt. How she loathes me, and how I love her. 	
What can I say?

I force a friendly smile, but she sneers and turns away. It burns inside to see that look, but I can do 
nothing. If she knew she would hate me more. And as long as she doesn't know, the pain grows stronger. A 
dilemma, a trap from which I cannot escape. I reach out to touch her, but she shrugs me off.

What can I say? 

We lie in bed, she is asleep, and I cannot. My eyes are red and burning. I turn longingly to her. 
She speaks my name, and my heart leaps. She curses my existence, and it breaks. Even in her dreams she 
scorns me.

What can I say?

I stand, and walk to her bed. I rest my head on her chest and silently weep into her bosom. I hold 
her tightly, as never to let go. But she'll never know, she can't. 

What can I say? 

I move up to her face. I hold her face in my hands. So Beautiful. I never want to let go. My face 
moves closer, and we kiss...I kiss...she doesn't know...she can't. I moan softly, and she stirs. My blood 
runs cold with fear. I open my eyes and see hers, scared and full of hate.

What can I say? What can I do?

I jump back with fear; she jumps up with surprise. My eyes fill with tears and I run. Where I can 
go? I don't know. I feel a hand on my shoulder and freeze in fear. I turn to see her eyes, different; soft and 
understanding. My voice squeaks out, "I.I'm sorry, Kiyone."

What can I say?

She moves closer and our lips meet again. My body is flooded with warmth. We part and she says 
to me, "I love you, Mihoshi."

What can I say?

"I love you too."

			Authors Note
Well, there it is. It's my first fic, and I could turn it into an actual story if you'd like. Tell me what 
you think. All questions and comments will be accepted gracefully, but any gay-bashing hate mail and I'll 
write a Sasami lemon. And I mean it.
