MEMORIES OF MOTHER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I remember you mother through echoes in time...
        But sometimes that is not enough...
I remember your smile and your warm loving touch...
        I cry when memories become to much...
You said you'd be near whenever you're far...
        But sometimes I wonder the truth...
If you were so close to my heart when gone...
        This pain in my soul would let me carry on...
A frame in time is all I have left...
        To remember your smiling face...
I can't wait to hug you once again...
        When I reach that final place.
