On learning of who the landlord is....

The scenario:

Each member of the Masaki household who is moving in next to
Hikaru Moriyata (Sasami exempted, as she is a minor by Terran
standards) is required to sign the rental contract.  But, how
do they react upon reading the contract, and learning who is
renting the condominium to them?

Tenchi Masaki:

Oh, man, more paperwork.  Still, I gotta hand it to Ryoko.

Hmm, run by some Japanese man.  Can't be that bad.  Right, three
bed and a loft, twelve hundred.  Wonder what that is in yen.
Guess I can't complain, he's paying for all the utilities.

Ryoko Hakubi:

(looks at application, shrugs, and signs.)

Washuu Hakubi:

This guy's eating the utilities.  Wonder how much it will be if I
started tapping into the power.  Maybe I can be nice to him and
develop a small power generator and refinery for him.  Still,
these Terrans-.

This guy's Juraian, isn't he?

(Scribble)

This could get interesting.

Kiyone Makabi:

Hikaru Moriyata?  Didn't the Argelians get him a few years ago?

(Pause)

It's gotta be a coincidence.

Mihoshi Kurumitsu:

(Reads entire rental application/contract twice, and notices
the signature block)

Hey, isn't that Commander Moriyata's signature?

(Turns the application over, checks the name of the lessor)

Hikaru Moriyata.  I thought he was MIA.  Well, he did get lost in
this area five years ago, I guess it's reasonable to do this.  But
why....

Oh well.

Aeka Jurai:

This contract is being drawn between the lessor Hikaru Moriyata-

(gasp)

Hikaru Moriyata?

(flip) (flip) (flip) (drops pen)

Is this even possible?  That's his sig-! He was-! But I-! Ten-!

(Pause)

(Scribble)

Oh my.
