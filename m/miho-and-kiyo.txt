Disclaimer: AIC and
Pioneer own the whole of
the rights to Tenchi, thanks
to a court case in which I lost
everything including my clothes
and (consequently) my dignity
and my clear criminal record.
Will Smith, of course originally
wrote the brillaint "Miami",
of which this is a parody.

This is the longest time I've
ever spent on a parody- I really
had to knuckle down on it since
I've had the idea for ages.
I hope you Miho-Kiyo and Will
Smith fans enjoy it- I certainly did!

          MIHOSHI AND KIYONE

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Mihoshi, uh, uh
Hey Kiyone, bringin the heat, uh
Haha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Swing that sword

Here I am in the Anime which is mah favourite show
The girls in the dress and the necklines low
Everyday like a expo, everybody so fine
(like) no place in space or time 
So I see a little red ship, coming through the sky
Me and Tenchi in the house lookin' up, well my my
With our eyes, pretty girls we spy
Working for the G.P saying' 
("Space police my...oh, hi!")
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Can't resist their faces
No use tryin'- Pirates, Cops, Chefs, Jurians, 
Hair all colours from blonde to cyan
I only came to go OVAin'
But everytime I watch I see those eyes a blazin
Just the type of woman I would share my love with
Kiyone, the girl who keeps us all tuned in

Party in Japan where it's anime
Takin' part time jobs as a way to pay
Welcome to Kiyone
Mihoshi and Kiyone
Kareoke on Yagami where beat is on
All night, on the ship till the battle's won
I'm goin to see Kiyone
Mihoshi and Kiyone

Yo I heard the two girls are always arguin'
But I can't hear em' fight for my life, 
it's harrassing
Poor girl running, blue eyes streaming
And she'd be screamin out, 
(Oh this is so embarrasing!)
So I'm thinkin' the two are closer than I thought 
In this Okayama hotbed lovin' resort
Hottest girls in the city, and they might be a pair,
But just there, heard a yell 
Like it could rip through air 
In the OAVs, with that Kiyone
Screamin' (Mi-ho-shi!)
Every time they go home, the get in to trouble
In the Yagami, goin' burstin' mah bubble
So fly in today
And land in the lake again
We wanna see you- don't matter if Washu thinks you're
a pain
Yo, ain't no other place in anime like this
And I swear I'm tellin the trough if you think 
I'm takin' the...

Party down at Tenchi's where the girls are hot      
All types, all cultures like a melting pot
Come and see Mihoshi
Et bonjourno Kiyone
Fightin' in the way that only sisters should
Or maybe even lovers- if they could
I'm goin to see Mihoshi
Mihoshi and Kiyone

Don't get me wrong, Ryoko is gorgerous hon
With Tsunami and Ayeka, we would like to sleep
An we all know Sesami and Nagi ain't lackin'
But take a peek, Mihoshi is a sweet for real
Y'all don't understand
I never such an Anime women with sand and tan
Tenchi, this is the plan
Take a walk on the wood, until her ship lands
Give her a hand
Damn, your both something
Let's go to a spot, in the hot springs 
Give you jeweled rings, I hear you two sing
I'm gonna get a mic for the two girls I like 
on the first night 
Eyes so clear, you can see to their pure soul
Hundred-thousand times I've seen them, 
still makes me whole
Ain't no surprise in the bush to see Tenchi's dad,
Miho-Kiyo, those girl's make me mad 

G.P central where the babes are great
A blonde haired beauty and her cool green mate
Welcome to Mihoshi
Kiyone and Mihoshi
Bouncin on Jurai where the sun is hot
All night, on the beach and they never stop
I'm goin to see Mihoshi
Kiyone and Mihsohi

THE END

Thank god I got that done!
Any C&C would be greatly appreciated-
famin' grills will be met with my
own demonic venom.
Evenin' all,
