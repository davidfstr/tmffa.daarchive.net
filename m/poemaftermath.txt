Aftermath
---------

She kneels over her wounded love
With snowflakes in her hair
Not knowing how he had been hurt
Or how she'd gotten there.

When last she knew, she'd been in line
A member of a tour
And she had made it as far as
The elevator door.

The papers she read the next day
Said something very weird
Had happened on the tour and that
Three students disappeared

Some said the boy had come early
To beat the morning crowd,
And had run up to the stairwell to
Where he was not allowed

Some folks said they could see a speck
Against the windows' glare
But she did not how the heck
They could see way up there.

They said the lift had broken down
>From 'tempts to save a buck
But from what had happened where he was
It'd been a stroke of luck

A gas main leaked had caused the blast
That's what the papers said
All that remained of him
Was a single hair of red

The two girls had just disappeared
No one was certain where
They'd searched on high, and searched on low
They simply were not there

But she could not remember them
Now matter how she tried
But something told her they'd been friends
A feeling deep inside.
