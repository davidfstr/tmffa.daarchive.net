Ryoko
------------
I am delaying sustenance
to express my infatuation
while I still have inspiration
to justify

But those who know
know
An amazing demon space pirate
An enchanting woman
a character
a cartoon
Her sagas are childish
and bring me to giddiness and pouting
However they hold that profound beauty
of a villain finding their heart

I shall feel more ridiculous  
than any of her antics
when I look back on my likely fickle devotion 
But I won't blush once
for the sake of the less animated principles of 'maturity' and 
'reality'
I will enjoy the thought that I would endure
being blasted to ash or torn to bits
just to feel her silken cyan hair against my face
and to see passion ignite in her golden eyes
only to be mocked as she disappears through a wall
But for the moment I'll settle
just being able to feel truly young
thinking to myself: 

Tenchi.you silly boy.
