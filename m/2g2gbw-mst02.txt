<CAVIS>  See?  This ain't so bad.
<REST OF CAST>  (Glares at him across the table on board Deep Six 
Nine.)
<CAVIS>  Okay, but it could be worse!
<WASHU>  (Face appears on screen.)  Hello, everyone!
<DAVNER>  (Puts face in his hands.)  It's worse...
<WASHU>  (Glares at Davner.)  Good news, guys.  I think I may have 
found a way to get you down.  (Cast looks up with hope in their 
eyes.)  Bad news is that it's like searching for a needle in a 
haystack.  I can get the kind of alpha mind patterns neccesary to 
transport you all to your appropriate dimensions, HOWEVER, this 
could take awhile.  First, I have to get samples of other mind 
patterns, and I can only do that with people not currenty on the 
satellite.  This means you'll be getting a new temporary guest while 
I test his, her, or its alpha mind patterns.  You follow?
<CAST>.............'Kay.
<WASHU>  Great.  Get ready.  (Dimensional hole opens above them, 
and a young woman falls to the floor.  Kasumi Tendo gets up and rubs 
her head.)
<KASUMI>  Oh, my!  Where am I?
<DAVNER>  THANK THE GODS IN THEIR HEAVEN!  FINALLY!  SOMEONE WHO CAN 
COOK!!
<RYOKO AND AFURA>  HEY!!!
<DAVNER>  No offense, darl'n's, but your cooking is....well...
<CAVIS>  (Helps Kasumi to her feet.)  Atrocious.
<RYOKO AND AFURA>  (Glare at Cavis.)
<KASUMI>  Um....Who are you people?
<CAVIS>  I'm Cavis.  This is Davner, Ryoko, and Afura.
<KASUMI>  Um....Hello there.
<WASHU>  Okay, guys!  Fic time!  Into the theatre!
<RYOKO>  Wait a second, Mom.  What are we watching this time?
<WASHU>  Let's see...  Nobuyuki, what've we got for them?
<NOBUYUKI>  Hold on.  I got it here.
<AFURA>  (blinks.)  What happened to Mihoshi?
<WASHU>  I barred her from the lab along with Ayeka.
<DAVNER>  Yes!
<WASHU>  But they're watching over closed circuit television.
<DAVNER>  DAMMIT!
<NOBUYUKI>  Here we go!  "La Blue Sammy!"
<CAVIS>  (Laughs)  With that title, it kinda sounds like a fusion 
between....OH GOD, NO!!!
<RYOKO>  (Glares at Washu and points at Nobuyuki)  I can't believe 
you let *HIM* pic the fic!
<WASHU>  (shrugs)  Hey, I can waste time picking out fics, or I can 
work on getting you down.  What's it gonna be?
<CAST>  (Grumbles.)
<WASHU>  Good.  Now get in the theatre.
<DAVNER>  Oh man...


(Cast enters the theatre and sits down.  Seating order from left to 
right is Cavis, Ryoko, Davner, Afura, and Kasumi.  Fic starts.)

"The author hired me to consult on this story. To prevent him from
being sued by an offended party."  A man, in a black suit complete
to the briefcase, holds out a card reading, "Mr. Lawyer, Lemons
and Magical Girl Attorney."

<CAVIS>  I know this guy.  He got me out of that parking ticket.

        "First off since this is a lemon, if you are too young in
whichever state, country, or mental ward you live in.  Please
don't read this story it contains bad sexual humor with little, to
no redeeming value."

<CAST> ....yea....

He opens his briefcase and removes a stack
of papers.  "Please sign here, here, and initial here."

<AFURA>  (reads papers.)  "Quid pro quo...juris prudence...y pluribus 
*penis*?!"

        "Ok, on to the next part of the disclaimer this story is a
parody mixing of a number of famous and not so famous Anime shows.
The most obvious being Pretty Sammy (or heaven forbid we forget
that Pioneer renamed it with a magical wave of their baton to
Magical Project S)

<RYOKO> Would that be the same baton they used to rename "Manatsu no 
Eve" to "Daughter of Darkness?"
<CAVIS> Probably. Don't forget "Tenchi Muyo in Love 2" from "A Far 
Away Feeling" to "Tenchi Forever."
<DAVNER> Well who cares about that one. Both titles sucked anyways, 
just like the movie. 

owned by Pioneer and Viz as well as La Blue Girl owned by Anime18.  
Also thrown in by the author was some Ramna1/2 (Viz video), Vanity 
Angel (Venus Comics),  El Hazard (Pioneer) and Kimagure orange road 
(ADV and Animego) and maybe a few more keep if your eyes peeled."

<CAVIS>  Noth'n do'in, bud!  They can make us watch, but they can't 
make us pay attention!  (rest of cast nods in agreement.)

        "Well that is about all for the disclaimer.  The author also
hired me to point out a few key magical girl points,

<DAVNER> (takes out paper) Rule #1 : All anibabes are bisexual. 
Rule #2 : all anibabes like to get raped. Rule #3 : All anibabes... 
<AFURA> (smacks Davner in the head) Baka! Those are the rules for 
hentai!
<CAVIS> You sure? They all seem to be bisexuals to me...
<AFURA AND RYOKO>  (Glare at Cavis and power up.)
<CAVIS>  (Ducks down in his seat.)  I'M JUST KIDDING!!  I'M JUST 
KIDDING!!

so I'll
probably pop in from time to time."  He stares at you for one
second.  "By the way if you do happen to run into the author
please tell him that the payment for the consultation on this
project is over do and that the check is in the mail, is not going
to work anymore.  He can talk to my bill collectors the Dirty
Pair."  The Lawyer chuckles  "See if anyone ever beats up one of
my clients again.  To think that they had the gall to attack
Lovely Monica.  Well now I own them... hahaha.  Uh, sorry."

<DAVNER>  Anyone understand a word of that?  (cast shakes their heads)  
Good.


La Blue Sammy

Episode 1 For Love, Sex, and Justice

<CAVIS> Isn't that Clarence Thomas's motto? 

        "Happy birthday, Sasami." Misao more whispered 

<DAVNER> Misao more? Don't recall any Japanese families named More...
<CAVIS> (nods) Maybe it's like a Bond pun. Like "Misao more sex."
<AFURA> Jeeze, can we keep the hentai jokes for when the fic actually 
hits the hentai.

to her friend than yelled. As the blue haired teenager stepped out of 
the red door. Walking down the little sidewalk that marked the path to
the gate.

<RYOKO> Do you get the feeling the author skipped the pre-reading 
phase?
<AFURA> Do you think anyone would volunteer to pre-read this?

        "Thanks, I'm sorry I'm so late Misao, but Sis was up all
night practicing for her next movie.  She got some new part on a
cheesy cop show."  Sasami rolled her eyes and grabbed Misao's hand
as they exited the fenced in lawn.  Glancing left and right she
drew Misao into a quick kiss.  Before dashing off down the street
pulling her friend behind her.

<KASUMI>  My...how sweet.  They're such good friends.  (Rest of 
cast looks at her in astonishment.)
<AFURA>  Oh jeez...This is gonna be trouble.  I can tell already.

        They briskly passed streets filled with cheery trees and
pedestrians.

<CAVIS> (singing) "When the cherry blossom starts to bloom..."
<RYOKO> Hey that's *my* song!
<DAVNER> And besides, this is based on La Blue Girl, which has 
absolutely nothing to do with love.
<KASUMI> Then what does it have to do with?
<DAVNER> ... This isn't going to go well.

After just a few block the same streets were crowded
with peers and friends as everyone hurried towards the two schools
set side by side Ryokirin Boys Academy and Kawai Girls School.

<Cavis> So only cute girls get into that school? And I thought 
Americans were prejiduced.
<Davner> A very smart man runs that school.

Sasami cheerfully waving at her friends, towing Misao into the
herd of students.
        Her heart stopped along with the rest of her body.

<RYOKO> OH NO! The tentacles are already coming!
<AFURA> Woah, calm down Ryoko. They're not here yet.
<KASUMI> (looks confused) Tentacles?
<ALL BUT KASUMI> (whistle innocently)

At the sight of a black haired pony tail in front of her. With out
Sasami's forward movement, Misao crashed into the brightly blue
haired girl causing them both to fall onto the ground.
        "You saw Tenchi again didn't you."

<AFURA> (immitating Sasami) No, I saw Brad Pitt. Why would Tenchi 
ever get that reaction out of me?
<RYOKO> What are you saying about Tenchi?!
<DAVNER> Well...
<CAVIS> Dav, if you enjoy breathing, I suggest you don't continue.

Misao's jealously hissed
in Sasami's ear.

<DAVNER> (immitating Misao) I want to get tentacle raped by Tenchi 
too!
<KASUMI> Tentacle raped?
<AFURA> (whacks Dav over the head with the mystical hentai mallet) 
Watch it...
<KASUMI> Would someone please explain this to me?
<RYOKO> Um... well...
<CAVIS> (rubs back of his head) It's um...
<DAVNER> Kasumi darl'n... you see...
<AFURA> ... Um...
<KASUMI> ... You people are strange.

While Sasami busily warded off helpful hands up
from her friends.
        "He's such a prince."

<CAVIS>  No, he's the artist formerly known as Tenchi.

She said dreamily failing to notice
Misao's jealousy.  Pulling herself and Misao onto their feet
Sasami dusted off her school uniform.  The spring summer version
with mini skirt white blouse and blue jacket decorated with the
schools insignia of a white rose.

<CAVIS> I'm getting very wierd Utena flashbacks.
<RYOKO>  I wonder if Chu-Chu will show up here next.
<DAVNER> Well atleast this story and Utena both have les...
<AFURA> (glares at Dav) Don't finish that statement.

 Grabbing up her book bag she
began once again to tow Misao through the remaining students.
Hurrying towards the school grounds.

***

        "Stand up, bow."  Yelled Eimi, the class leader of 10-2, as
homeroom began once again.
        "Hi, class."  Ms. Mihoshi said.  "Is everyone here today."

<AFURA>  Unfortunately so, it would seem...

She told the crowd  inanely, before calling the students names and
making the correct notation as to there status.

<RYOKO> (immitating Mihoshi) Straight, straight, bi, bi, lesbian, bi, 
straight, bestiality...
<DAVNER> Now now Ryoko, you got it all wrong. In hentai, the females 
are into *anything* related to sex. There is no such thing as a 
straight woman in hentai.
<AFURA> (eyes Davner) Exactly how much hentai have you seen?
<DAVNER> Well... not much really...
<CAVIS> Uh huh. That would explain why you always use up all our 
money everytime there's a new release.
<KASUMI> What's a hentai?
<RYOKO> That's what Dav is.
<DAVNER> Hey!
<AFURA> Also known as an ecchi.
<DAVNER> Now hold on...
<CAVIS> Or simply just a pervert.
<KASUMI> I don't get it at all.
<DAVNER> (folds arms and falls back into his seat) You know I can 
feel the love from all of yas.

        "Well now that's done, we need to come up with something for
the upcoming class festival."  She nodded to the class president
giving up the floor.
        "Listen up people. We are so... behind schedule.  Class 10-3
has already begun construction on the set for their play and we
still haven't even got an idea for what we are going to do." 

<CAVIS> *Anything* but a talent show. Please not a talent show. 

Eimi
yelled at the rest of the students seeming to stare at Misao and
Sasami in the front row.  A hand raised in the back and she nodded
towards it.
        "If my calculations are correct, I think that 

<AFURA> Ninety-eight percent of the people who read this fic will 
have muderous tendencies towards the author.
<DAVNER> What's the other two percent?
<AFURA> Noboyuki.
<RYOKO> And here I thought the man atleast had standards...

I cam make a
stable portal to another dimension.  Which would be just great for
the student festival."  A brown haired girl told Emi.
        "Um, thanks Ms. Mizuhara... do we have any *reasonable*
suggestions."

<CAVIS>  What was so unreasonable about that?
<DAVNER>  Hey, Afura. Does Makoto have a sister?
<AFRUA>  No.  But he *is* rather...er...feminine.

        "How about we build a Nazi bar, dress up in authentic
clothing, and put a tank in the back."
        "On the second floor!  Come on people, think."
        "I say we do a live magical girl show."  A girl in the back
yelled, before continuing to scribble out a fan fic.
        "Any better ideas."  Crickets chirped in the back ground.

<DAVNER>  (Stomps at the ground near his feet. Crickets stop chirping.)

"Anyone please."  She pleaded at the rest of the students.  A
tumble weed slowly rolled through the room.  "Okay were doing a
magical girl show." 

<AFURA> But now we're going to do something good instead!
<Ryoko>  Let's set our school on fire!!  Yea!!
<DAVNER> Ryoko, you just love blowing up those schools don't you? 
<RYOKO> (shrugs) I get lots of fan mail for it.

Dead silence greeted the announcement as
girls shifted in their seats.
        *Somehow I just know that I'll end up as the leed.*  Sasami
thought shifting uneasily in her seat.

<AFURA>  Conceited bitch...
<RYOKO>  (Glares at her.)  Hey!  That's still Sasami-chan up there!  
Watch it!
<KASUMI>  A magical girl show!  How exciting.
<REST OF CAST>  (groans.)

***

        "Yes Sis, sure I understand.  I guess that me and Misao will
go to the library after gymnastics."  Sasami paused listening to
her sister.  "No I understand its your big rape scene and you
can't come home for my birthday."  She paused again.  "Friday
sounds fine.  I'm looking forward to it, Aeka."   Pause.  "Love
you to, bye."

<CAVIS>  Aeka's doing a rape scene?!
<RYOKO>  (Laughs)  You're kidding me!?  *Aeka*?!

        "Sasami, don't worry."  Misao kissed Sasami lightly on her
lips.  "I've got a very special present for you tonight."

<KASUMI>  A gift!  How wonderful!
<DAVNER>  Ten dollars says Kasumi has a coronary and dies before the 
end of this fic.
<AFURA>  Done.

        Sasami giggled and pulled the other girl into her.  "I'm
looking forward to it." She said huskily hugging her friend
tightly.

***

        "Damm, Ms. Kiyone really worked us today she is such a
perfectionist.

<RYOKO> Which explains why she gets along with Mihoshi so well. 

 She had me up on the balance beam for an hour."
Sasami shoved a vaulting board towards the storage room assisted
by Misao.
        "You were gorgeous on the balance beam."  Misao pulled the
piece of equipment breathing heavily. 

<AFURA> (immitating Misao) Oh yes! Mr. equipment please do it faster!
<DAVNER> And they say *I'm* the hentai..

The storage of the equipment was actually her job as club president.  
As well as
stats of the athletes 

<CAVIS> Oh I'm sure she just *loves* that job.
<RYOKO> I'm glad I don't go to that school.
<DAVNER> Actually, if this is based on Pretty Sammy you *might* be in 
that school.
<RYOKO> ARGH! I feel violated...

and cleaning of the gym so that the athletes
could go home after a hard days workout.  But no one would have
been surprised to see the two of them together pushing the
equipment, they had been inseparable since kindergarten.

<RYOKO> Gack! I knew this guy would fit pedophelia in here somehow. 

        "And..."  Sasami asked as the spring board finally arrived at
its designated place.  Misao looked up at her miserable.
        "Come on say it."  Sasami said gazing frankly back into her
friends eyes, knowing how much she enjoyed this type of foreplay.

<RYOKO>  Foreplay?  Oh no...Please no!  Don't!

        "No, please don't make me, mistress."  

<CAVIS> (immitating Misao) Don't make me engage in foreplay! I want 
to skip to the real action.
<KASUMI> (extremely confused) What do you mean by real action, Mr. 
Cavis?
<CAVIS> Um... well.. I meant the real competition instead of the 
practice...
<KASUMI> Oh...
<DAVNER> Nice recovery. (sarcasm)

Misao said backing away from Sasami into a wall.  She started 
breathing hard as Sasami cornered her smiling with a lusty grin. 
Rubbing her body
against Misao's before grabbing up a wad of her hair.  Yanking it
back, Sasami forced Misao's head back and exposed her throat.
        "You know what I want to hear."  Sasami told her watching
tears form in Misao eyes and gently licking them away.  Hoping
that this little pain would be enough for Misao.

<KASUMI> ?

        "Mistress, please."  She pulled the hair even tighter forcing
Misao to her knees.  "I... got... " whisper "wet seeing you on the
balance beam."  Sasami yanked Misao's hair to the side throwing
her to the ground on her right arm.  *I hope that is enough for
her.*  She thought staring down at her friend.
        "That is my good little slave.  Now you have a present for
me."  Misao ducked her head and pulled something out of her pocket
handing it to Sasami.  At first Sasami thought it was a long cat's
collar until she read the inscription on the I.D. plate.
"Property of Mistress Sasami."  Misao blushed a bright red at
Sasami's feet.  *I wonder where she got up the courage to buy it.*

<KASUMI>  Um...What's going on?
<CAST>  (Looks at Kasumi)
<CAVIS>  Uh oh.  I think we have a problem.
<DAVNER>  Stop the fic!  (Fic pauses.)  Ryoko, Afura, I think you're 
gonna have to take Kasumi into the back room and give her..."The 
Talk."
<AFURA AND RYOKO>  Pardon?
<CAVIS>  You know..."THE TALK."  (Afura and Ryoko look to each other.)
<AFURA>  Well, all right.  If you think it'll help.
<DAVNER>  We don't want to traumatize the poor girl.
<RYOKO>  Okay, okay, leave it to us.  Come on, Kasumi.  We need to 
talk to you.
<KASUMI>  Well, all right.
<CAVIS>  (Turns to Davner.)  Beer run?
<DAVNER>  (Nods.)  Beer run.  (Cast exits theatre.)

(Cavis and Davner are in the kitchen area drinking beers a few hours 
later when Afura and Ryoko come in followed by a very nervous, and 
jittery Kasumi.)
<DAVNER>  (Blinks)  Hello, darl'n's.  How'd it go?
<RYOKO>  Great!  No problem!
<CAVIS>  (Points at Kasumi)  Then what's wrong with Kasumi?
<AFURA>  Um...well...
<RYOKO>  You see, some of her questions were rather...well...
embarrassing...
<DAVNER>  Translation:  You didn't know the answers.
<RYOKO>  SHUT YOUR FACE!!!  Anyway, we decided a sex ed movie might 
help.
<CAVIS>  Sex ed movie?
<RYOKO>  We had Washu send up some stuff from Nobuyuki's collection.
<CAVIS>  !
<DAVNER>  !
<CAVIS>  So...what you're saying is that the only things Kasumi 
knows about sex is what she's seen in LA Blue Girl, Overfiend, and 
Demon Beast Invasion?
<AFURA>  !!!
<RYOKO>  !!!
<AFURA AND RYOKO>  (Look to each other.)  Uh....oh....
<DAVNER>  (Reaches out to Kasumi>  Kasumi, darl'n?
<KASUMI>  (Screams.)  DON'T TOUCH ME!!!!
<CAVIS>  Congragulations, girls, you've sexually traumatized Kasumi.  
I hope you're proud of yourselves...
<AFURA>   Hey!
<RYOKO>  Yeah!  It's not our fault!
<DAVNER>  Then who's fault is it?!  Look at her!  She's scared out of 
her mind!
<RYOKO>  (Sarcastically)  Well, gee, Dav, why didn't you handle it 
personally, if we're so stupid!?  Why don't you take her into the 
back and make her a woman?!
<DAVNER>  That's not funny!
<RYOKO>  What?!
<DAVNER>  Look, even I respect the fact that there are certain female 
characters that are off limits.  Sasami is on top of that list.  
Kasumi is a *very* close second.
<CAVIS>  (Looks at theatre door.)  Some people simply have no respect 
for proper anime tradition anymore...
<WASHU>  (Face appears on the monitor.)  Hey!  You're holding up my 
research!  Get back in the theatre!


(Cast reenters theatre.)

        "Put it on."  She said holding the collar out to Misao who
almost reverently fastened it around her neck.  Then flicked her
head back to give Sasami a good look at it.  "Hmmm... I can't
quite see it.  

<RYOKO> Well then, you should take some advice from Ryo-Ohki and eat 
more carrots.

Slave, take off your clothes

<CAVIS> I wonder if Sasami needs replacements for the clothes she 
borrowed from the gym teacher.
<RYOKO> (glares at Cavis)

so I can get a good look at your collar."  Misao started to stand up, 
but was pushed
roughly back down by Sasami.  "I didn't say you could get up."
Continuing to stare at her friend 

<AFURA> Real friends don't make their friends wear dog collars.
<DAVNER> (rubs neck) Someone tell Aeka that...
<CAVIS> Oujosama to Oyoubi accurate?
<DAVNER> Extremely...

until Misao's face was permanently red from blushing.  Misao pulled 
her top off slowly
making sure that Sasami had an unobstructed view though at the
same time appearing timid and reluctant to undress in front of
her.

<AFURA>  I wonder why.  She's just some freaky, dominating 
psychobitch.
<RYOKO>  Watch your mouth!

Sasami impatiently grabbed up Misao's hair again forcing her
on to her tip toes and with her right hand began to undress Misao
hurriedly her need finally getting the better of her.  In seconds
Misao stood before Sasami completely naked.  "Stay."  

<Ryoko> (tosses a Scooby snack at the screen) Good girl. 

Sasami ordered her as she walked around her slave admiring how Misao
looked with the collar.
        "I am pleased with your gift, slave."  Sasami pushed Misao's
hair aside and kissed her on the back of the neck.  Slipping a
hand down the spine of her back causing Misao to shudder and
tense.  *Why does she always require so much of this before she's
happy.* 

<CAVIS> Yes why do you women always need so much foreplay?
<DAVNER> (nods) Why can't you just be satisfied with the simpler sides 
of sex? No, you need foreplay and cuddling and...
<RYOKO> (sighs) I'll take any of it actually...
<DAVNER> (moves towards Ryoko) Ok...
<RYOKO> (blasts Davner into the wall) From Tenchi you baka!

Sasami wondered as her hand passed over Misao's rear

<AFURA> (immitating Sasami)  Damnit, someone needs to show her how to 
wipe better.
<REST OF CAST> Ew...

and touched her pussy testing to see how wet Misao was.  She should
have known, the more that Sasami pushed, pulled, prodded, and
humiliated Misao the wetter she got. Misao was already on the verge of 
cumming. 

<DAVNER> Geeze, she doesn't last long does she. 
<RYOKO> (mumbling) Longer then Ayeka sais you last...
<DAVNER> Atleast I'm getting some from my loved one.
<RYOKO> ... (cries)
<CAVIS> Ooo nice one, Dav. 
<DAVNER> Hey! She started...
<AFURA> (whacks Davner with the mallet) Prick.

 Sasami's hand just remained their gagging her
friend as the other hand crawled around Misao's quivering form and
latched on to a nipple.  Massaging and the twisting in equal
measure forcing Misao to twitch slightly.  "Stay."  Sasami warned
waiting for just the right moment continuing her ministration on
the nipple until she felt Misao shudder in just the right way.
Forcing her fingers as far as they would go into Misao's cunt she
felt her orgasm.  Sasami smile!

<RYOKO>  Oh god!  (runs out of the theatre, her hand over her mouth.  
Retching can be heard from outside.)
<KASUMI>  I don't want to watch...yet I cannot look away.
<DAVNER>  My mommy says there are no monsters, no real ones, but there 
are, aren't there, Cav?
<CAVIS>  (Nods)  Yeah, Dav, and its name is STRIKESTWICE!
<AFURA>  (Mouth gapes open in astonishment.)  I'm....gonna go get some 
popcorn.  (gets up and starts for the exit.)
<DAVNER>  Good idea.  I'll go with you!  (Gets up and follows Afura.)
<CAVIS>  Um....you guys know what kind of candy I like, right?  No?  
Then I had better come along.  (Gets up and follows.  Kasumi sits in 
her chair staring up at the screen.  Cavis turns and gently pulls her 
out of her seat.)  C'mon.  You too.  Let's go.

(Cavis walks back into theatre for a moment)
<CAVIS> (Points to reader) Hey! You too! Come on! We don't want this 
fic screwing you up any more than you already are! Let's go!

d delighted that she had been able to do this for her friend.
Knowing that if she had been standing in front instead of behind
Misao she would have been forced to be angry.  "Did you just come.
Without even pleasing your Mistress.  But I might forgive you."
Sasami turned Misao around forcefully pushing her to her knees.
"If you please me."
        "Yes, Mistress."  Misao pushed Sasami's leotard to one side
using only her mouth and poked her tongue into Sasami's clit.
Sasami moaned slightly at the intrusion.  With out any real
thought her fingers started to rub her nipples through the thin
fabric causing them to stick out in little pointed nubs visible
through the cloth.  Sasami buried her other hand into Misao's hair
guiding her.  Gasping ever so slightly as the pressure that had
been building in her since she had felt Misao's eyes on her during
the practice on the balance beam, began to build.  Misao slowly
started to circle Sasami's clit with her tongue causing her to
buck just a bit and her breath to catch.  Sasami closed her eyes
enjoying the feelings coursing through her body and shivering with
every sensation.  She felt Misao's hand wrap around her and
anticipated the next feeling.  But even Misao knew how to torment
her pausing she looked up at Sasami.  "Mistress, am I pleasing
you."  The girl asked looking up !
at the closed eyes of her lover.
        "Continue."  She huskily moaned forcing Misao's head back
against her hips with her hand.  Not even bothering to open her
eyes.  Once again she felt the pleasure building up inside of her
as Misao latched her tongue around Sasami's clit and forced a
finger into her ass at the same time.  Sasami bucked wildly
filling Misao's mouth full of cum as she finally came.  Reaching
down she pulled Misao up from the ground and passionately kissed
her tasting her own juices and the love of her friend.


(Cast is assembled in the kitchen.)
<CAVIS>  Holy shit...
<AFURA>  No kidding.
<RYOKO>  Okay.  Calm and rational.  Calm and rational.  I am going to 
find the author of this fic.....and then I am going to *murder* him.
<DAVNER>  Kinda extreme, ain't it, darl'n?
<RYOKO>  You can't possibly tell me you like it!
<DAVNER>  'Course not.  I'm just saying it's not worth doing time in 
Riker's Island over.
<CAVIS>  Well, the fic is...bizarre, we still can't get down from 
here, and I think Kasumi might be brain dead...  (Humming and 
clattering can be heard from the kitchen.)
<RYOKO>  (sniffs the air.)  Hey, that smells pretty good.
<KASUMI>  Okay!  Dinner's ready!
<DAVNER>  SWEET!  FOOD!  (hops up and darts for the cooking area.)
<CAVIS>  (Shakes head.)
<WASHU>  (Face appears on the screen.)  HEY!!  BACK IN THE THEATRE!! 
(Shakes fist at screen.)  DON'T MAKE ME COME UP THERE!!

***

(Cast reenters theatre.  Davner is munching on a Kasumi-made crab puff.)  

        Sasami waved goodbye to Misao.  Her face still flushed from
the pleasure received and given earlier.  Walking slowly home,
enjoying the freshness of the night air.  She was finally sixteen

<RYOKO> And the author thinks her being older is going to make up for 
that last scene...

and for some reason everything seemed new and different today.
Her eyes were alive soaking up the world around her.  Sasami was
happy, radiantly smiling at the world as a whole.  

<CAVIS> I think the author meant "whore" instead of "whole."
<RYOKO> Hey watch it! That's still...
<DAVNER> (takes Ryoko's arm, shaking his head) No, Ryoko. That's not 
Sasami anymore. That's some evil clone of her or something. 
<AFURA> We have to kill it!
<KASUMI>  BURN HER!!  BURN HER!!
<Cavis>  (Looks at Kasumi, then leans over to Ryoko.)  She doesn't 
have anything sharp on her, does she?

Winding around streets that let the longest way home, she enjoyed 
life and her
new found appreciation for it.

<DAVNER>  I think I've heard this rant somewhere before....That's 
right!  I read it in a Penthouse letter...

        When she finally got home, Sasami was surprised to see that
the lights were on already. *I thought Sis said she would be
shooting till after two tonight.*  Shrugging she opened the door
to the house and walked in.
        "I'm home."  She called out kicking off her shoes and putting
a pair of house slippers with little rabbits at the toes on.

<KASUMI> Kill the rabbits!
<REST OF CAST> (sweatdrops)

         "Hi Sasami."  A blue hair young woman said appearing before
her.  She was just about Sasami's height with the exact same color
hair made up in a pair of long pony tails that almost reached the
floor.  Behind her another woman appeared slightly taller with
hair a green almost cyan that was sticking up at odd angles.

<RYOKO>  Oh God, please, no!
<DAVNER>  Well, at least the perv had the common goddamn courtesy to 
put Tsunami in this lemon.  It's about time *someone* did.
<CAVIS>  (Nods.)

"Its me your mom, Tsunami."

<DAVNER> No that's not true! That's impossible!
<CAVIS>(In low Vader voice) Search your feelings, you know it to be 
true!
<DAVNER> NO!! NO!!!
<AFURA> I never knew Tsunami was a deadbeat mom. 

        Sweat drop.
        "Um... excuse me, but I really must be going right now."
Sasami said slipping the slippers off and putting her shoes back
on.  Slowly turning around and walking towards the door as the
cyan haired woman teleported in front of her.

<RYOKO> (immitating Ryoko) Help me get out of this extremely bad fic.
<AFURA> (immitating Sasami) No way. If I'm stuck in here, so are you.
<RYOKO> Dammit!

 Giving Sasami a feral grin while floating a few inches off the ground 
and flicking
her tail.

<RYOKO>  Please don't do what I think I'm gonna do!
<CAVIS>  I don't like where this is heading...
<DAVNER>  I think I'm aroused....  (Ryoko and Afura both blast Davner 
into a wall.)

        "Why don't you sit down, Sasami.  There is so much I want to
tell you."  The one who called herself Tsunami grabbed Sasami's
arm and dragged her into the family room sitting herself down on
the chair across from the couch.  But not before she had seen
Sasami sit on the couch it self.  The whole time her eyes stared
at Sasami, burning her image into Tsunami's mind.  Once Tsunami
had sat down, the cyan hair woman who Sasami finally noticed was
floating stood behind Tsunami and rested her hands on the other
woman's shoulders.

<RYOKO> (immitating Ryoko) I am going to *so* kill you for this.
<DAVNER> Hey! Now don't take your frustrations towards the author out 
on Tsunami. 
<CAVIS> That's right... take them out on Davner.
<DAVNER> Hey wait...
<RYOKO> (blasts Davner into the wall) Thanks for the suggestion.
<DAVNER> (in cumpled heap) You're out of my will, Cav. 

        "You do have a picture of me somewhere, right."

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Sasami)  Yeah, but you're naked.

Tsunami asked.  Settling herself in the chair and giving a fond look 
up at
the other woman when the hands settled on her shoulders.

<DAVNER> I didn't know you were Tsunami's bitch.
<RYOKO> I AM NOT TSUNAMI'S BITCH!
<CAVIS> According to this author you are. Well... that or she's your 
bitch.
<KASMUI> Sis always sais Shampoo's her bitch.
<REST OF CAST> !
<CAVIS> ... Well... that changes the whole outlook on that show now 
doesn't it. 
<AFURA> Well I always knew Akane was... a bit of a...
<DAVNER> Afura, let's just try to forget this was ever mentioned. 
<KASUMI> I never said it was Akane.
<REST OF CAST> !

        "All of my pictures, of my mom were destroyed a long time
ago.  But I do know that you are way to young to be her.  She
would be in her forties at least, and you are maybe in your late
twenties."

<CAVIS> Now we all know by Tenchi dynamics that's not necessarily 
true.
<DAVNER> (nods) Take Ryoko, who's five-thousand...
<RYOKO> (blasts Davner into the wall) TWO-THOUSAND!!! GET IT RIGHT!!!

        "Late twenties I'll have you know that I haven't aged since I
was 22 and that was over 300 years ago."

<AFURA>  My, aren't we touchy about it.
<CAVIS>  Yeah, well, you know.  Women hit the big three-oh-oh, and all 
of a sudden, they're worried about their looks.
<AFURA>  Pig...

The woman said leaning closer to Sasami.   "We of the Jurai-Helm clan 
are the protectors
and guardians of the Shinma a race of demons.  Many years ago I
was given that mission and now it is your turn.  To stop there
overpowering sexual energy from being used on humans."

<RYOKO>  (Imitates Tsunami)  These demons appear in the form of 
producers, high school football players, (glares at Davner)  AND 
SICK, PERVERTED, TWISTED, IMMATURE PIRATES LIKE YOU!!
<DAVNER>  ........Ouch.

        "I'm here to give you a birthday present."  She held her hand
out  level to the floor.  "Appear!"  A flash of light and an odd
baton was hanging in the air.  Carved of wood, devoid of color,
and about two and a half feet long with a small heart ingrained at
the center.  Two rows of 5 black beads an inch in diameter each
dangled from the heart.  She pushed both ends of the wooden baton
showing how flexible it was for wood able to turn a full 180
degrees 

<CAVIS AND DAVNER> (put hands over crotches) OUCH!

"as good as any mans penis and much more flexible." 

<AFURA> And it doesn't give out after forty-five seconds.
<DAVNER> And how would you know?
<AFURA> ... (cries)
<RYOKO> (takes the mallet and whaps Davner in the head) My god! You 
just won't stop, will ya?!
<DAVNER> (rubs head) What is with you girls?! You start it and then...
<CAVIS> Dav, buddy ol' pal. They're right. We're wrong. Learn it, live 
it, love it, and get used to it.
<Davner>  (Moves closer to Afura)  I'm sorry, Darl'n.  If you like....
we can fix that...
<Afura and Ryoko>  (Blast Davner to the wall.)

She stared hard at the other woman behind her.  She tried to hand the
baton to Sasami, who was edging toward the door.
        "Sasami, where do you think you are going."  The cyan hair
woman asked in a stiff voice.

<RYOKO>  RUN SASAMI!  RUN!

        "Just to use the bathroom... he he, uh I guess it can wait."

<RYOKO> NO IT CAN'T!!!! 

She hurriedly sat back down on the couch under the stares of the
two woman.

<RYOKO> (immitating Ryoko) Watch out! She might call the Beareu of 
Good Taste on the author.
<AFURA> (immitating Tsunami) Ha! The Beareu of Good Taste wasn't able 
to stop them from 
releasing Tenchi Forever! They'll never stop us!
<RYOKO AND AFURA>  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA!!!!
<DAVNERr>  (Shudders)  Ugh....Jinnai flashback.....

        "Now take the baton in your hand and call out *Sexual Magic
Change* you will become La Blue Sammy."  

<DAVNER> (immitating Tsunami) Or alternatively, you could call out 
"Slutty Tree Change" and become Awfully Ugly Tree Whore Haruna. 

She said trying to give the baton once again to Sasami.
        "Um... No thanks, you can keep it."  Sasami scooted as far
away from the thing as allowed by the couch.
        "Take it."  The cyan hair demon ordered.  Showing off a large
number of teeth including a set of fangs.

<RYOKO> (bad Dracula immitation) Or I'm going to suck your blood!
<DAVNER> The way this fic is going you're going to be sucking 
something...
<CAVIS> (puts hand over Dav's mouth) I have to watch you every second 
don't I?!

        "Uh... Sure."  Sasami picked it out of the other women's
hands with two fingers and held it away from her body.
        "Now call out Sexual Magic Change!"  Tsunami told Sasami
excitedly.
        "Um... Sexual Candy Change."  Sasami said holding the baton
away from her trying to think up a good excuse to drop it.

<CAVIS>  Good excuse...hmmm....How about, "IT'S YOUR MOM'S FRIKK'N 
DILDO!!??"  Will that do?

        "Sexual Magic Change."
        "Ok... Ok... Sexual Magic Change."  Sasami said engulfed in a
bright pink light as her clothes tore off Sasami's body. 

<CAVIS> I don't suppose it's possible in anime to have a transformation 
*not* involving clothes being torn off is it? 
<AFURA> (takes out book) According to the anime by-laws... no. Well... 
atleast for females. 
<DAVNER> (sniffles) God bless those perverts who make anime. 

Black cloth began to rap 

<AFURA> (begins singing) Stop, collaborate and listen.
<RYOKO> STOP!!!! There will be no Vanilla Ice sung here. I'd rather 
listen to the black cloth try to rap. 

around her body forming into a dark blue almost
black leather corset and short skirt.  A red ribbon flashed into
existence behind her.  

<CAVIS> And the red ribbon fell onto the floor being attached to 
nothing, and there was great rejoice.
<REST OF CAST> Yea...

Her hair lengthened and darkened a shade

<DAVNER> Ah the magical ability of hair in anime to suddenly shift 
colors without notice.
<CAVIS> (nods) Like Ryoko's hair in Tenchi Forever.
<RYOKO> That was the least of my worries in that movie...

touching the red ribbon and swirling with every turn of her head.
        "Um... I hate to bring this up but shouldn't their be a set
of panties."

<CAVIS>  Oh....my....god...

        "No its part of the hentai code. All monsters must have easy
access to you... its in there contract."  The Lawyer waved a piece
of paper at Sasami and then disappeared.

<AFURA>  (Checks contract.)  My God!  This is notarized!
<CAVIS>  (Looks at contract over her shoulder.)  And approved by the 
*U.N.*????

        "She looks yummy in the outfit."  The demon said staring at
Sasami and licking her lips.  Her evil eyes aglow as she stared at
Sasami with a warm hunger.

<CAST MINUS RYOKO>  (Looks at Ryoko.)  Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...
<RYOKO>  RUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh, God, what did this 
guy do to me!?  (buries her face in her hands and cries.)

        "Uh, how do I change back."   Sasami jiggled uncomfortably in
the outfit.
        "Hold on one minute.  Smile."  Tsunami asked as Sasami was
blinded by a flash from a camera.  "Now all you have to do is just
cut to a new scene like this."

<DAVNER> That way we don't use up our special effects budget too 
quickly. 

***

        "When a first born daughter of the Juraihelm clan reaches
sixteen years of age she receives her mothers baton to fight evil
and keep the Shinma sealed from Earth." 

<CAVIS> I'm not sure what's worse : the fact this fic's story is just 
that lame or the fact they market stuff like this and it sells with 
plots just that lame. 
<RYOKO> Oh come on, it can't be that bad. 
<AFURA> Yeah, I mean it has to be better than this.
<CAVIS> Ryoko, could you hand me that copy of La Blue Girl volume 1 
you showed to Kasumi?
<KASUMI> NO!!!!! (runs out of the theatre screaming)
<CAVIS> (sighs) Davner could you go fetch her?
<DAVNER> (gets up from chair) Sure, Cavis. Maybe I can get her to 
make some more of those crab puffs while I'm at it. 
<CAVIS> Anyways, to quote the description of La Blue Girl volume 1:

La Blue Girl 1: It began centuries ago, when the Miroku ninja clan 
made a deal with
forces of the underworld - leading to centuries of struggle between 
rival clans. And now, after more than 600 years of peace, the denizens 
of the underworld are about to get a new boss. 

Miko Mido, an 18-year-old ninja-in-training is suddenly entrusted 
with the family business - making sure the sex-starved Shikima stay 
out of humanity's way! But when the rival Suzuka clan steals the 
signet case that symbolizes the demonic pact, Miko and her older 
sister, Miyu, become the targets of the most dangerous race of 
perverts ever to walk the earth. 

What's a ninja-woman to do? Fight back, with every bit of battle 
skill and sexual sorcery she can muster! But is Miko strong enough 
to save Miyu from the clutches of the Shikima on their home turf - 
the bowels of the underworld? 

<RYOKO AND AFURA> !!!
<AFURA> Exactly... exactly how well does this stuff sell?
<CAVIS> I don't think you really want to know. 
(Screaming can be heard from outside the theatre)
<DAVNER> I am not going to rape you!
<KASUMI> STAY BACK!!!!
<CAVIS> You know girls, I must once again thank you for the wonderful 
job you did showing Kasumi the facts of life.
<RYOKO AND AFURA> (glare at Cavis)

 Tsunami told her daughter smiling proudly the whole time.  "I'll 
leave the rest of the
explanations to your grandmother."

(Davner re-enters theatre with Kasumi, him staying as far away from 
her as possible)
<DAVNER> That was fun... (sarcasm)
<CAVIS> Get anymore puffs?
<DAVNER> No, but I nearly got a few limbs chopped off. 
<KASUMI> (puts butcher's knife under seat)
<CAVIS> (whispers to Ryoko) Think you could teleport that out of 
here when she's not looking?
<RYOKO> (whispers back) Why should I be worried? Not like I'm a man.
<DAVNER> No, according to this fic you're Tsunami's bitch.
<RYOKO> (cries uncontrollably)
<CAVIS> Smooth move Dav ol' boy.
<DAVNER> Now wait... 
<AFURA> (blasts Davner into the wall) There there, Ryoko. It'll be ok. 

        Sasami stared at the cyan hair woman incredulously.  *This is
my grandmother.*  "Hey, don't look at me kid."  The demon told
her.  "I'm your mother not your grandmother."

<CAVIS AND DAVNER>  (Sing)  I'm my own grandmaaaaaaa!  I'm my own 
grandmaaaaaa!

        "We've gone over this a hundred times Ryoko, you got me
pregnant, remember.

<RYOKO>  WHAT!!??  (Looks from side to side.)  I swear!  I don't 
even *know* this woman!!

I gave birth to her, so I'm the mother.  That
makes you the father Ryoko."

<RYOKO>  (Buries head in hands and begins to cry.)  What did this 
author do to me!?
<CAVIS>  Well, I'm not up on the specifics, but I'd say he made you 
a hermaphrodite.

        "But, I'm a woman."  Ryoko told Sasami.
        "You just had to see how much fun it would be to be a guy and
then fucked me for a whole month straight.  Did you expect me not
to get pregnant or something."

<DAVNER> (immitating Goldfinger) No Ms. Tsunami, I expected you to 
die!
<Afura> (eyes Ryoko) You better not be making any moves on me...
<Ryoko> (in tears) I'm really not attracted to other women!
<Cavis> (coughs) TV episode 12...
<Ryoko>  (Cries.)

        "Hey, you weren't complaining at the time and if I remember
correctly you were the one who suggested the idea in the first
place.  Always complaining how the baton wasn't enough and that
you missed a dick."

<AFURA>  (Pukes into a bucket.)
<RYOKO>  (weeping.)  No more!  No more!  (Cries)  Oh God, make it 
stop!  No more!
<DAVNER>  I can't bear to see her like this!  Well, let me elaborate.  
(Points at Ryoko in the theatre chair.)  I can't bear to see her like 
*this*.  (Points to the Ryoko on the screen.)  I think I kinda like 
her like *this.*  (Pulls blaster and points it at her head.  
Sniffles.)  Don't worry, Ryoko.  It'll be over soon.  (Sniffle)  
Quick and painless.  I promise!
<CAVIS>  (pushes gun away just as  Davner fires, causing him to miss.)  
Dammit, Dav!  Don't be stupid.  In an hour the fic will be over and 
she'll be good as new.

        Sweatdrop!  Sasami decided that now would be a really good
time to escape from the two escaped mental patients and sneaked
out the door. 

<RYOKO> (still sniffling a bit) NOW?!?! Try several paragraphs ago!

 While the fight continued on for a good five minutes.
        "Don't you think she would made a terrible mom.  I should be
the one you call mom, Sasami."

<AFURA>  Yeah, you're a fit parent.  I can tell.

Ryoko turned towards the couch.  A
number of black lines blinked around where Sasami had sat
outlining her former position.
        "Ryoko could you go find her, I'll make some tea."  Tsunami
stood and headed towards the kitchen.

<RYOKO> NO!!!! Don't find her! Run for your life! Run before you're 
forced to suffer anymore of this. Oh god just run! (starts throwing 
energy blasts at the screen)
<CAVIS> (trying to restrain Ryoko) Calm down! It's just a fic!
<RYOKO> DIE!!!!
<WASHU> (picture appears in a small window on the movie screen) Well 
I'm glad I decided to put a protective energy field up around the 
movie screen.
<AFURA> (grabbing Ryoko's legs) Well that's great Washu, but how the 
hell do we calm her down?!
<WASHU> Oh... well I'd say the best thing to do is just let her do 
that for a couple more minutes and she should eventually tire a bit. 
(image dissapeares)
<DAVNER> (holding onto Ryoko's waist) Gee, thanks a bunch Washu. 
You're a real help.
<KASUMI> DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE! 

***
(Cast sits back down after finally calming Ryoko down)

        "Yes, is this the police department."  

<CAVIS>  My name is Friday.  I carry a badge.

Pause.  "I would like
to report a break in."  Pause again.  "Yes, they are still in the
house..."   Crunch.  Sasami stared at what had once been a bright
green phone.  Doing her best to ignore the fact that the cyan
haired woman had reached trough the glass with out breaking it.
Sasami dashed out of the booth and into the lights of an oncoming
car.

<RYOKO> (screams) No! Not Sasami-chan!
<AFURA> YES! The fic can now end! 
<DAVNER> Good move Sasami! Better to die like that then to suffer in 
the rest of this fic!
<KASUMI> YES! DIE!
<CAVIS> Unfortunatly, I somehow doubt she's dead. 
<REST OF CAST> (sighs)

***

        Sasami woke up on her futon.

<CAVIS> Told ya. 
<DAVNER> And you're happy you're right?
<CAVIS> Actually... no. 

 Still dressed in a school uniform.  *It was all a dream.*  Something 
moved outside of her
door.  *No it can't be, its all a dream.*  

<RYOKO> We've been telling ourselves that since we started this fic. 
Trust us, it doesn't work. 

She crawled off her futon and peeked out of the side of the screen.  
Breathing a sigh
of relief and opened the screen all the way.  "Hi Sis, how was the
shoot."
        "Oh, Sasami did I wake you up, sorry."  Aeka said stepping
out of the bathroom dripping,  nude except for a towel on her
shoulders.

<CAVIS>  (Opens mouth to say something.)
<DAVNER>  (Places blaster at Cavis' head.)  One off color remark and 
I'll blow your brain all over that back wall...
<CAVIS>  (Closes mouth.)

        "No, how was the shoot."  Sasami asked cautiously trying not
to stare at her sister.

<RYOKO> DAMNIT! I knew I smelled Kajishima all over this fic!
<KASUMI> Kajishima?
<RYOKO> A very bad man who thinks that sisters and brothers should be 
in love.
<KASUMI> Oh, I think it's sweet he thinks that siblings should care 
for each other.
<RYOKO> (sweatdrops) Um.... not that kind of love...

        "The director said that no one could do a rape scene like
me."  She smiled, wiping her hair with the towel.  Causing her
breasts to jiggle a little and pull Sasami's eyes to them.

<CAST> BREASTS TO JIGGLE?!?!
<DAVNER> I knew it! This is Tenchi Forever Aeka.
<RYOKO> (nods) She's the only one that has em large enough for that. 

        "Uh, that's great Sis.  I really got to get some sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow."  She hurried back towards her room.
        "Happy Birthday, Sasami."  Her sister called out as she also
headed towards her room.  The words fell on death ears 

<CAVIS> Death ears? 
<AFURA> So her ears died, but the rest of her body lives on?
<RYOKO> It sounds just lame enough to be the plot of an anime. 

as Sasami saw a pale wooden item on the other side of her futon.

***

        "The Baton has finally returned to earth."  Rumiya gloated to
her followers.  "Our time is at hand to rule the twin worlds."

<CAVIS> (immitating Zordon) Alpha, summon the Power Rangers!

Finally she could get her revenge on Tsunami, all she needed was
the talisman.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates SEELE)  Yes, and the Lance of Longinus will soon 
be in our hands.
<DAVNER>  (Imitates SEELE)  Do not betray us, Gendo Ikari.

        Ramia chuckled, as soon as she found the Talisman she would
also find Tsunami's first daughter.  She would make that bitch beg
to be her slave

<RYOKO> If it'll end this fic, I'll beg to be your slave. 

 and lead her on a collar in front of Tsunami.  No
even better a matched set of slaves... mother and daughter.

<AFURA> (immitating Ramia) They'll go together well with my matching 
pair of earings.

        "Mistress we have narrowed the search area to a ten kilometer
radius."  Ramia's little brother Rumiya told her fawning at
Ramia's feet.  "There's also an all girls school in the center of
that area, she probably attends it, mistress."
        "Dog," Ramia kicked him for punctuation.  "

<RYOKO> Does that mean we get to kick the author everytime he makes 
a grammer mistake?
<DAVNER> (cracks knuckles) I sure hope so. 

Of course she would attend that school.  Hmmm... that gives me an 
idea, we'll
need a submissive that goes to that school though..."

<CAVIS> And hence, the plot thins.

***

        "Okay people the student council has approved *our* idea for
a magical girl show." Eimi paused consulting a schedule.  

<AFURA> (immitating Eimi) And they've also approved your idea for a 
movie Mr. N. 
<DAVNER> Three hours later, the student council was arrested with a 
blood/alchohol level average of point three oh and possesion of crack. 

"We've got the two to three slot on the main stage."
        "Ms. Twice has agreed to write the script for the show."  A
hand waved in the rear  acknowledging the comment before
continuing to write.

<RYOKO>  So the little twisted freak has a little twisted sister...
<CAVIS AND DAVNER>  (sing)  We're not gonna take it!  No!  We're not 
gonna take it!  (Afura joins in.)  WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT...
ANYMOOOOORRREE!

        "Ms. Mizuhara, your in charge of special effects.  No
Explosions, please!"  The brown hair girl nodded in
acknowledgment.
        "Can I have Ms. Yume and Ms. Kagato to help out."
        "Sure I don't see why not."
        "Costumes will be Modoka."
        "I'll need Lill and Achika."

<CAVIS>  Why does that name sound familiar?
<DAVNER>  (shrugs.)

        "Okay.  That leaves us 18 people."  She paused again.
"Approximately ten people for scenery... 

<AFURA> And the other eight will be used to attempt to fix this story.

any volunteers."  She looked out at the raised hands, completely 
ignoring Sasami and
Misao.  "

<CAVIS> (immitating Eimi) I'm sorry girls. We just don't like to 
give out positions like that to sick, S&M freaks like yourselves.

1...4..7...thanks that's good enough.  Now the rest will be in the 
play."
        "As soon as we get a script out line.  We'll vote on the
lead."
        "Tomorrow."  The crazed writer yelled.

<DAVNER> (immitating writer) Tomorrow I swear I'll try to turn this 
into a good fic!

        "Tomorrow then."

***

        Gymnastic had been grueling again.

<RYOKO> That damn Gymnastic! So cruel...

 Ms. Kiyone once more trying to make her students reach a perfection 
only she could see.
        Sasami had stolen a few minutes with Misao in the storage
closet afterwards but just hadn't felt like sex. 

<CAST> YEA!!!!!

 After a few minutes of kissing and petting  she walked away to take 
a shower.
 Ever since her birthday she just hadn't been in the mood.  Misao
felt the difference in her mistress. 

<DAVNER> Yeah, she changed when she learned her father was...
<CAVIS> (throws a Butterfinger at Davner) Bad Davner! Bad!

 But had not brought up the subject yet.  If Sasami didn't snap out 
of it soon, she would do
something really *bad* and have her mistress punish her.  Just the
thought made her feel a little hot.

<CAVIS> And that's when Misao looked down to see that she was on fire. 
She then burnt to death, and thus the fic ended happily.

        Sasami opened her locker changing into a short shirt and blue
blouse after taking a quick shower.  Grabbing up Misao she burst
out of the gym.
        "You feel like ice cream."  Sasami asked heading towards a
popular hang out.

<KASUMI> (immitating Misao) No, but I feel like making you cream.
<CAST> !
<DAVNER> (shakes head) How could this happen to her? 
<KASUMI> Well according to that movie Ryoko and Afura showed me...
<CAVIS> Thanks Kasumi, but we really don't need the description. 

        "Yes," Misao whispered back latching on to Sasami's arm as
they walked down the road towards Abcb enjoying the stroll and
talking about inconsequential gossip.

<CAVIS>  ABBA?!  I thought they died!
<DAVNER>  Horrible bands never die, they just fade away...

        "The plays only a week away now.  You got your lines
memorized Misao?"

<AFURA>  (Imitates Misao) Yeah, yeah, moan and groan while you 
pleasure me.  I think I can manage.

        "I don't like being the villain."  Misao snuggled into Sasami
happy for the second time today.
        "Its odd how we ended up on opposing sides in the play."
Sasami chuckled.  "That's just so weird.  We would never fight
like that in real life."

<CAVIS> (immitating Sasami) No, I'd just beat the living shit out of 
you for my own sexual pleasure instead.

        "You know, I would never fight you." She whispered into
Sasami's ear.  "Mistress"  Snuggling even closer into her friends
side.

<DAVNER> (immitating Misao) Unless you promised to beat the shit out 
of me even more!
<RYOKO> Ok ok! We get the point!
<DAVNER> You know, Ryoko, I've been meaning to ask you something. If 
you and Aeka both end up marrying Tenchi would that mean that you'd 
have to undergo bridgeroom training by Aeka too?
<RYOKO> I... I never inquired about it...
(sounds of writing can be heard as the authors of this MST write down 
an idea for their next collaboration)
<CAST> (looks around the theatre for the source of the noise)
<Cavis> What's that sound?
<Ryoko> (Mutters bitterly) Cav and Doscher screwing me over again...

        "Or I you."  Sasami opened the door holding it open for her
friend.  Taking a table by the window both of them stared out at
the pedestrians.  Madoka appeared from behind the counter and
wandering up to there table, Sasami had forgotten that her class
mate worked here.  While she ordered a scoop of coffee pecan ice
cream, Sasami heard the bell chime behind her as the door opened.
Misao's face suddenly went from timidly happy to neutral.
        "Hey Tenchi, the usual."  The owner called from behind the
bar.
        "Sure, and a bowl of hot soup, if Madoka made it."  The dark
hair youth called sitting down at the counter accepting a cup of
cappuccino.

<DAVNER>  Look, Ryoko.  It's your favorite person in the whole world.  
And look!  He's here to screw Sasami.  How sweet!
<RYOKO>  (Glares at Davner) 
<CAVIS>  No, Dav, Tenchi only screws ghosts and trees.
<RYOKO>  STOP IT!!!  YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM!!
<DAVNER>  What's there to understand.  He found a thousand year old, 
rotting tree whore more attractive than...  (Afura claps hand over 
his mouth.)
<AFURA>  There is a line here you *really* don't want to cross...
<RYOKO> Besides... that's only TV Tenchi.
<DAVNER> (mumbles) Likely excuse...

        Sasami's heart stopped for about ten seconds before she
remembered to breath again.  Misao watched Sasami's expressions
change, jealousy coursing through her veins.  *At least that isn't
the cause of her sudden loss of interest in me.*  Misao thought
sighing a breath of relief.  *It must be something that happened
on her birthday.  Maybe I should just ask her.  It would distract
Sasami from him.*
        "Sasami... Um... Is there something wrong.  You haven't been
the same since your birthday."  

<DAVNER>  (Imitates Misao)  Oh God!  You're not pregnant are you!?
<REST OF CAST>  (Looks at him)
<DAVNER>  (Shrugs and points at Ryoko.)  Why not?  It's happened once 
already.
<RYOKO>  (Starts crying again.)

She whispered to her friend.
Tearing Sasami's gaze from the Tenchi.
        "I just have a lot on my mind."  She said noting Misao's look
of concern.  "I'm fine, don't worry."  Sasami said turning her
attention back to watching Tenchi out of the corner of her eye.
"Isn't he handsome Misao, just like a prince."

<CAVIS>  Yeah, even I wanna date him.  (Ryoko glares at him.)  I'm 
just kidding.  (Ryoko continues to glare.)  I'm serious!  I'm just 
kidding!
<RYOKO>  (Mutters)  You'd better be.  I gotta enough to deal with 
already...

        "Sure."  Misao agreed tearing into her ice cream.  While
Sasami picked at hers.  Obviously fixated on something else.
        "Sasami, I just remembered something I have to do."

<AFURA>  (Imitates Misao)  Weekly gonnorhea test!  Seeya later!

        "Ok, see you tomorrow Misao."  Sasami turned her full
attention back to her friend and gave her a big smile.
        "Bye"  She left Sasami starring out of the side of her eyes
at Tenchi.
        Misao headed home her mind awash with thoughts of Sasami and
jealously.  Not paying any attention to her surrounding.

<Ryoko>  (Leans toward Kasumi and whispers.)  Tentacles...
<Kasumi>  (Jumps and screams.)
<Ryoko>  Heh heh heh....
<REST OF CAST> (eyes Ryoko)
<RYOKO> What? She wasn't paying attention to her... ACK!
<KASUMI> (swings butcher's knife) I'll take off those tentacles of 
yours!
<RYOKO> (dodging) Hey hey! I'm not really a hermaphrodite!
<Cavis>  Grab her!
<Davner>  (Grabs Kasumi from behind.)  Calm down, darl'n!
<Afura>  Smooth move, ex lax....
<Ryoko>  It was just a joke!

        The door to her apartment was locked again.  Not that she
expected it to be other then that.  Grabbing the key out of her
purse, she opened the door and walked into the room.  The lights
turned on with a flick of her wrist.  Exposing a blinking
answering machine.  She groaned and pressed the button, knowing
already what it would say.

<CAVIS>  (Imitates angry answering machine)  Hey you!  You're the guy 
who side swiped me on the Brooklyn bridge.  Don't think I didn't see 
your big, blue pony tails!  You'll be hearing from my lawyer!

        "Hi Misao, I won't be home till late again.  Order some food
from the usual place."  Pause.  "Make sure you do your homework."
Pause.  "Honey don't wait up for me.  I love you."
        "Ah... was that you mommy slave..."  Ramia cooed out to Misao
from a dark corner of the room.
        "Who are you?"  Misao asked timidly frozen in place like a
deer in headlights.

<AFURA>  Now if only she would be hit by a truck...

        "I've come to recruit you for the RamiaHelm clan.  

<DAVNER>  We have an excellent dental plan, and a 401K.  

You are
going to find Tsunami's daughter for me, slave.  Now get down on
your knees."  

<CAVIS>  I'm curious.  Do any of these evil geniuses ever think to 
check the phone book before they embark on some sinister plan to turn 
their best friend against them?
<REST OF CAST>  Hmmmmm....

Misao suddenly makes a run for it heading towards
the door only to run into Rumiya.  Grabbing hold of her, the kid
dressed in a riot of colors pulled Misao in front of the older
lady.  "Now, their won't be any running away little one.  Your
fate is already sealed."  Jerking Misao's hands together she
pulled Misao up on to her toes and let go.  Somehow the hands
stayed together leaving Misao exposed.  Admiring her captive Ramia
jerked Misao's skirt to the floor which were closely followed by
her panties.  Tears started to run down Misao's eyes as she
blushed a bright crimson.  

<RYOKO>  *NOW* she's embarrassed?!

Worse by far was the fact that her body
was betraying her already. 

<AFURA> Stupid body! Always turning traitor on me, aren't ya?!

Her pussy glistening slightly with
juices.  "Hmm... this little whore is wet already."  Ramia
murmured into her ear.  She grabbed hold of Misao's blouse pulling
it up over her head effectively blinding!

<DAVNER> Wedgie!

 her and exposing a pale white bra.  The woman grabbed her bra and
forcefully removed it.  Misao not being able to see and in her
awkward position couldn't maintain her balance and swayed
painfully by her arms.  A muffled scream escaping her lips.
Muttering something Rumiya's finger nails started to glow.
Lightly caressed Misao's breast with them.  Pain ripped through
her body and Misao screamed again convulsively.  Rumiya grinned
kicking her brother away from the girl who had been trying to get
in on the action.  "She is my little slave." 

<DAVNER> (immitating Ramia) No! She's my slave!
<AFURA> (immitating Rumiya) No! You got the last slave! I want this 
one!
<DAVNER> This one's better! She moans louder!
<AFURA> Always about the moaning with you isn't it?!

Running her finger
nails down the sides of Misao's breasts enjoying herself.  Misao's
feet gave out leaving her limply suspended by her arms.  Breathing
rapid short breaths, that were choked with screams.
        Ramia took a step back letting the slave catch her breath.
It was necessary for the ritual that she was able to talk.
"Rumiya go get me something to drink from the kitchen."  

<CAVIS AND DAVNER>  It's Miller time!!

She
kicked him on the ground for emphasis and the pleasure of it.

<RYOKO> Kick the baby!
<DAVNER> (baby voice) Don't kick the baby.
<RYOKO> (kicks Davner)
<CAVIS> Damn, did he walk into that one.

        "Now Misao, was it.  I want you to agree to be my slave."
She surrounded the girl with a spell so that the words would be
everywhere around the girl.  That her voice would vibrate all the
right places and make her slave long for her touch.
        "Please... "  Misao moaned her mind experiencing and feeling
so much more then when Sasami and her had played their games.
        "Slave, you must always refer to me as mistress." 

<CAVIS> (immitating Ramia) If your refer to me as Ramia I'll have to 
punish you!
<DAVNER> Oh like that would stop her. 
<CAVIS> There are pains that are not pleasurable...
<DAVNER> (holds up copy of Tenchi Forever) And we have an example 
right here...

She
whispered in Misao's ear and yet her words seem to course through
Misao's whole body tickling her with pleasure.  Misao gasped at
the feel.  Taking her glowing fingernails Ramia carefully traced
down Misao's spine sending the nerves it contained into
convulsions.  Like she was being ripped apart from the in side.

<AFURA>  (Snaps her fingers.)  *That's* what watching this fic feels 
like!  "Being ripped apart from the inside!"  I've been looking for 
the right words since the damn thing started!

        Ramia accepted the glass of water from her brother breathing
hard herself as her eyes became pin points.  Waiting for Misao's
body to stop squirming.  Rumiya felt her own body begin to get
wet.  

<RYOKO> (looks puzzled) Is it my imagination, or did both of them 
suddenly become females?
<AFURA> (confused) I'm... I'm not quite sure...
<CAVIS> Oh my god! Ramia has the Jusenkyo curse!
<DAVNER> No no no! Rumiya's supposed to be the guy, so he has it.
<AFURA> (looks back on previous paragraphs) Wait a minute... which 
one is the woman?
<KASUMI> Well Rumiya might've poured water on himself by accident...
<RYOKO> Shh Kasumi... (opens up Pretty Sammy character guide)... Ok 
I'm lost...
<CAVIS> (looks at guide) Ok... Ramia is the woman... and Rumiya's the 
guy... 
<AFURA> (shakes head) How do you get the sexes of the characters this 
screwed up?!
<DAVNER> Well... we got one hermaphrodite in this fic and two 
characters that can't figure out if they're female or male... 
<CAVIS> (nods) Thus we all learn the value of "pre-reading." 
<AFURA> (still checking earlier parts of the fic) Kami-sama...
<DAVNER> Should I ask how long he's been messing this up?
<AFURA> No...

Giving pain always had this effect on her.  Reforming
someone's mind to your standards.  

<Cavis> Now this fic has crossed the line! That's the goal of the 
public school system!

Tsunami had never understand.
With the Baton that should have been hers, she could have ruled
the Shinma and the world from the shadows.  Forming everyone in
the worlds mind as she wanted ruling the sheep with out even their
knowledge.  But Tsunami was the oldest and that bitch, their
grandmother had stopped Rumiya from bonding with the Talisman.

<DAVNER>  Translation:  She walked in on her in the bathroom and 
caught her with the mega dildo...

She would get it and Tsunami's child as well.  Then Tsunami, the
thought made her need even greater.  She chuckled to herself.
Dumping the rest of the water on her brother she continued playing
with Misao.

<RYOKO> So did he turn back into a guy now? 
<AFURA> I'm not even going to touch it...

        "You want me slave."  Ramia shouted amplifying the pleasure
her voice gave.  Pain and Pleasure that was the key to making a
good slave. 

<DAVNER> (salesman voice) That's right! You too can own a copy of 
Ramia's "How to Make a Good Slave." In it are such helpful techniques 
like using nipple clamps and the right way to whip your slave. Order 
right now and we'll throw in a free set of Ginsu knives! Altogether, 
a $49.95 value, yours for only $69.95! Operators are standing by!
<CAVIS> (speaking rapidly in barely understandable voice) Offer not 
available in New Jersey, New York, or Canada. Giving us your credit 
card will mean we will rob you of all your money. Agreeing to these 
terms means we now own your soul. Offer is only valid if you call on 
a Saturday when the moon is perfectly positioned between Mars and 
Uranus. 

The voice was enough after the earlier pain to set
Misao into orgasm her chests and legs 

<DAVNER> Jeeze! I'm not female and don't understand what he just said, 
but damn that sounds rather painful!

twitching her breath in
gasps.  Rumiya thrust her fingers into Misao's clit as the orgasm
took her changing the pleasure into screams of pain that lasted
forever in the girl's mind.  Even after she had removed her
fingers from the girls twitching cunt.
        "Now slave tell me that you are mine."  Ramia purred once
again setting Misao's body to quivering from her voice.

<Cavis>  (immitating Ramia.)  Tell me I am beautiful!   Tell me I am 
wonderful and fantastic, and gorgeous...
<Davner>  (Nods.)  Cause if you don't I'll whip your ass!
<AFURA> Really... if she enjoys pain what the hell is the point in 
punishing her?!?!

        "Mistress, please, I am your slave."  Misao cried tears
soaking through the blouse covering her head.
        "Good."  Grabbing one of the girls hands, Rumiya yanked it
level to the room leaving Misao's other arm in immense pain as it
supported her whole body.  "Appear."  Ramia called out holding her
hand as a yellow whip appeared.

<RYOKO> If we all yell "dissapear" loud enough, would the fic 
dissapear?
<DAVNER> No, but this might help with the pain. (hands Ryoko a beer.)

  Decorated with a fan at the hilt
it was the best Ramia's magic could create after three hundred
years of attempting to replicate the original Talisman.  She
shoved it into Misao's hand.

<Davner> She's spent three-hundred years working on a dildo?! And 
they say otaku need lives...

        "Rumiya, this is were you come in.  Look in her eyes and take
her mind forcing it to become one with the whip."  Ramia's voice
still massaged and tickled Misao making her forget the pain in her
arm.  The blouse that had been covering Misao's eyes was pushed
down exposing her tear stained cheeks.
        Staring into her eyes Rumiya felt the connection to the whip
and Misao.  Feeling the  magic snap into place.  Transforming
Misao into a blond haired girl dressed in red leather straps
complete to long spike healed boots.  A yellow feather protruded
at an odd angel from her hair.

<Afura> (immitating Ramia) Damnit Rumiya! I told you not to pass that 
off as hair gel again!

        "Now little slave all you have to do is decorate the hilt of
the whip with your virgin blood and you will be able to call
Shinma."  

<RYOKO>  (laughs)  Joke's on you if you think *this* little slut's a 
virgin!!
<CAVIS>  Careful, Ryoko.  She might come after *you* next.
<RYOKO>  (Gulps and gets up.)  I am out of here!
<AFURA>  (Gets up)  Me too.  This is freaking me out!  (Grabs Kasumi 
from her chair.)  Come on before you get *really* screwed up.
<KASUMI>  But I want to see what happens.
<RYOKO>  No you don't.  (Leans over and whispers in her ear.)  
Tentacles.
<KASUMI> (Screams and runs from the room.)  
<CAVIS>  (Looks at Davner.)  Beer?
<DAVNER>  (Nods.)  Beer.
<CAVIS>  Kitchen?
<DAVNER>  Kitchen.  (The two get up and leave the theatre.)

Misao's body felt alive from the transformation so many
new sensations filling her and the words coming out of Ramia's
mouth didn't help instead of horror she should have felt, all that
her body could absorb was pleasure.  "Hurry up my slave you will
do it one way or another before the night is through."  She ran
her finger tips across Misao's breast as the pleasure in her words
mingled with the pain of the spell.  Forcing Misao to come once
again to the brink of orgasm.  Misao's hand swept down to her clit
still holding the whip.  All of her mind focused on obeying her
new mistress and finding some needed relief.  She forced the
whip's handle into her clit and past her hymen drenching it in
blood and cum as she bucked wildly an electrifying pulse sending
her to new levels of pleasure she had only dreamed of before.
Ramia released the spell that!
 was holding her in the air and let her fall to the ground.  Misao
continued to orgasm even on the floor for what felt like an
infinite time to her.  Finally panting she kneeled before Ramia.
        "Mistress, how may I serve you?"  The blond haired girl
asked.
        "Pleasure, me."

(In the dining room.)
<DAVNER> (Moans.)  Oh, Kasumi...you are amazing!
<KASUMI>  Thank you, Mr. Davner.  I've had to practice this for years 
before getting it right.
<DAVNER>  Well, let me tell you,  (Takes another bite of chicken 
teriyaki.)  This is fantastic!  (Rest of casts nods their assent.) 
<KASUMI>  I'm glad you like it.
<WASHU>  (Face appears on screen.)  Ahem!
<AFURA>  Forget it Washu!  We're not watching any more of that 
twisted fic!
<RYOKO>  (Nods)  Yeah, *Mom*.  We're done!
<WASHU>  (Glares)  Okay, then I'll just have to bring out the 
tentacle machine.
<CAST>  !!!!
<KASUMI>  TENTACLES!!!!  (Screams and runs from the kitchen into the 
theatre.)
<REST OF CAST>  (Sighs.)  
<WASHU>  Oh, relax you big babies.  It's almost over, then I can get 
you down.
***
(Cast reenters theatre.)
        Sasami sighed.  *Damm, I wish that I could have talked to
him.*  The thought kept running through her mind as she walked
towards her house.  *He was so cute, I should have said hi.  I'll
do it next time I promise.*  She opened the gate and noticed that
once again the lights were on.  *Sis is home early.  That has to
be it.*  After all how many times can insane visitors come to your
home and inform you that their relatives.

<CAVIS>  A good question.  Ryoko?
<RYOKO>  Well, let's see.... Ayeka, Sasami, Mayuka...I don't think 
Mihoshi's related to Tenchi, but I wouldn't be surprised if she 
was...

        She cautiously opened the door.  "Hey Sis you home?"  The
house echoed her question early but gave no reply.  *Guess, she
just left the light on.*  Taking off her shoes she headed towards
the family room, the source of the light.  Sasami was still full
from the ice cream and coffee, she had picked at for over an hour
while Tenchi had talked to Madoka and the owner.
        Rounding the corner of the hall, she saw a young girl with
bright red hair sitting on her couch holding the baton.

<CAVIS>  You gotta be fucking kidding me...
<RYOKO>  Oh, man!  This is *too* sweet!  (Holds up her hand eagerly.)   
I get to tell her!

Reasonably Sasami did a 180 and headed back towards the door only
to be blocked by a small ninja, maybe four foot tall, clad in dark
blue ninja suit complete to a hood covering its face.
        *What is it with little kids invading my house, today?*
"Excuse me, but I forgot something in my book bag."  Pointing
towards the bag next to her shoes.
        "Miya?"  The short ninja asked.

<RYOKO>  Ryo-Ohki?!
<CAVIS>  Great.  Bestiality.....goodie...

        "Uh, yah..."  Sasami started edging around the ninja who
moved to block her way.
        "Tsunami say you run away allot.  Meow.  Grandmother wants to
talk to you.  Miya.  You no run.  Meow."  The weird little ninja
told her.
        "Grandmother?  But the only person in their was a little
girl."  Disbelief colored her voice.
        "That's right, I'm your grandmother, Washu."  The little red
haired girl told Sasami.  "I'm also the World's Greatest Sexual
Genius." 
 
<DAVNER>  And they say men brag too much...

She proudly announced.  At the word sex Sasami jumped
over the ninja, using him as a spring board, and ran for the door.
*Not another crazy, what is happening to my life.*  Opening the
door took too long and the little ninja tackled her knocking,
Sasami's head against the door.

***
        "Hi, this is Sasami.  In the next episode I'll have to...
that is too gross... I won't do it no matter how much you all try
to make me.  I want to give that to Tenchi... 

<RYOKO>  (Bolts upright in her seat.)  YOU SCHEMING BITCH!!!
<Davner> Does that mean you want to give yours to Tenchi too?
<Ryoko> (forms an energy sword) Oh that's it! You're going down Dav!
<Cavis> I think she's a bit sensitive on the subject.
<Afura> Well you gotta admit it destroys the whole "tough girl" image.
<Davner> I'M SORRY!
<Ryoko> (swings sword) Stay still! Trust me I'm told that this is 
quite painless.

The next episode is
called "On the day of the play."  

<KASUMI>  And it rhymes!  How cute!

And just who is that Slutty Misa
any ways?"

Hit the back button on your browser now... ok I warned you.

        Okay first things first this was suppose to be a one shot
story... unfortunately it got just a tad to long and I'm having
trouble writing the final mass rape scene.... 

<CAST>  (Put their heads in their hands and cry.)  

so in true meanness
I have to tell you that the sequel is on the way.... what a
threat.  HA HA.

        I hope you liked the story.  Please send all constructive
criticism and praise to STRIKESTWICE@hotmail.com and send all
flames and other such nastiness to my lawyer at
BSaddress@nowhere.com.

<DAVNER>  (Writing on his hand.)  no...where...dot...com...  
<AFURA>  (Smacks Davner in the back of the head.)  Moron...

        The check is in the mail Mr. Lawyer you can tell them to stop
following me in the pizza truck.

<RYOKO>  That's not a pizza truck, it's a SWAT team...

(Back in the kitchen.)
<Washu>  (Face appears on screen.)  Did you enjoy the fic?  (Cast 
glares at her.)  Heh, too bad.  Anyway, where's Kasumi?
<Davner> (Points at a corner where Kasumi is standing, brandishing a 
kitchen knife.)
<Kasumi>  Just stay back!  I know you're not what you appear to be!  
I see just *one* tentacle, and I'm lopping it off!
<Washu>  Christ!  What the hell did you do to her?!
<Ryoko>  Whoops!  Gotta go!  (Dematerializes.)
<Afura>  I...um....have some reading to catch up on.  (Bolts from the 
room.)
<WASHU>  (Shakes head.)  Never mind.  I'm almost done with my 
research, so just hold tight.


(Davner appears at the door to the Tree Room where the rest of the 
cast is waiting for him.)
<DAVNER> Ok, what the hell happened?
<RYOKO> Well... you see...
<CAVIS> Kasumi was out of it and sort of um... found the tree...
<DAVNER> Oh god no...
<AFURA> Yeah and you see... well... you know *she* isn't very picky.
<DAVNER> Oh wonderful, so what the hell are we going to do... what 
the?!
<RYOKO> (picks up Davner) You've still got time to get her before 
*she* has her way with her.
<AFURA> Good luck Dav.
<CAVIS> Have fun.
<DAVNER> Wait a minute! Stop! Don't do this...
(Ryoko tosses Dav into the tree as his screams can be heard all the 
way down)

*Two hours later*

<RYOKO> What's taking him so long...
<CAVIS> Well... we might have to send someone after him next...
<AFURA> Hey Ryoko, isn't she scared of you...
<RYOKO> Don't even think it.
<Ayeka>  (face appears on screen.)  Ah!  Cavis!  Good.  I'd like to 
speak with Davner.  Where is he?
<Cavis>  (Points at tree.)  He's in there.
<Ayeka>  WITH HARUNA!!!???
<Cavis>  (Nods)  And Kasumi too...
<Ayeka>  IS THAT SO!!??  THAT SON OF A BITCH!!!!
<Davner>  (Climbs out of tree carrying Kasumi in a fireman's carry.  
His face is covered in lipstick.  His shirt buttons are undone.  He 
drops Kasumi to the ground.)  I...need fluids!
<Ayeka>  You bastard!  I can't believe you!
<Davner>  Ayeka!?  It's not what you think!
<Ayeka>  Oh really?
<Davner>  No, you see...
<Kasumi>  (Wakes up and hugs Davner.)  Oh thank you!  I was so 
frightened!  (Kisses Davner)
<Ayeka>  YOU CHEATING, MOLLIDONI BASTARD!!!  I NEVER WANT TO SEE 
YOU AGAIN!!!
<Davner>  Wait, darl'n!  It's not what you...  (Ayeka's image 
disappears.)  think....
<CAVIS> So how was she?
<DAVNER> (decks Cavis) Don't ever ask me about that again. I'm going 
to be in the shower for the next... few weeks. (Takes off shirt and 
throws it at Cavis.)  Here!  Burn this!

(In the kitchen)
<KASUMI>  (Puts a plate in front of a dejected Davner.)  Here you are.  
I'm sorry, Mr. Davner.  I didn't know.
<DAVNER>  (Waves the apology aside.)  It's okay, darl'n.  Don't worry 
about it.  (Begins eating.)
<WASHU>  (Face appears on screen.)  Bad news people.  Kasumi's alpha 
pattern didn't match up.  (Shakes head)  I don't get it.  Her pattern 
started out flawless, but halfway through...it's like her mind has 
been warped.
<CAVIS AND DAVNER>  (Glare at Afura and Ryoko as they quickly leave 
the room.)
<CAVIS>  So we're stuck here a while longer then?
<WASHU>  (Nods.)  Yep.  Okay, Kasumi.  Time to go home.
<DAVNER>  (Grabs Kasumi's arm.)  Oh no you don't, Washu!  This one 
stays!  She's the only one here who can cook!
<WASHU>  Davner...
<DAVNER>  Please, Washu!?  Let her stay?!
<WASHU> Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..............
........................No!  (Presses a button on her holotop.  Kasumi 
disappears.)
<DAVNER>  DAMMIT!!!
<WASHU>  Later, boys.  (Washu's image disappears.)
<CAVIS>  Stranded...
<DAVNER>  Starving...
<CAVIS>  It can't get any worse...
<AYEKA>  (Face appears on screen.)  Davner!  I want to talk to you!
<DAVNER>  Oh, yes it can...(Gets up and faces the screen.  Smiles.)  
Hello, darl'n!
