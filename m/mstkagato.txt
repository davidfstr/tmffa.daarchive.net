KAGATO'S REVENGE
WRITTEN BY: Washu
MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans a.k.a. JOLT!!!
June 3, 1998

Hello people! This is my thirtieth MSTied fanfic, and I wanted to do
something that everyone would remember it. Well, this one was on the
back burner for awhile and even the other MSTiers, including Don
Eucloid, wouldn't even touch it. I've read it and it is so wrong that it
*has* to be MSTied!

LEGAL STUFF: All the Anime characters in the following MST belongs to
the talented and creative people who made them. Please don't sue me for
I am merely borrowing your characters and not making any claim on them.
The Club Anipike belongs to Nightbreak, whom I am grateful to for
allowing me to use it. Samantha Jones a.k.a. Silhouette, belongs to me,
Jamie Jeans

Now, on to the story!
________________________________________________________________________

Samantha walked into the theater alone, dressed up in full suit, except
for the mask, with a scabbard sword on her back, Tanto strapped to her
lower left leg, and a pouch full of throwing stars attached to a belt at
the small of her back. She stopped at the door for a moment and took a
deep breath. What she had been told by Washu about the fanfic she was
going to MST was so horrendous that *no* one was willing to MST it.

That meant a challenge.

"Well, if I survived the first two parts of that A-ko College fanfic and
a good chunk of AK, then I can survive this," she thought.

She knew that everyone in the Club Anipike was waiting for her return,
wondering if she was to be driven insane by the horrendous material of
the fanfic.

"I won't let this get to me. I may never have riffed a fanfic alone, but
I sure as hell won't let it drive me in sane," Samantha thought
determinedly.

Walking down the aisle, she sat down in the third seat and shouted for
the fanfic to start.

                                *               *               *
Back in the Club Anipike, Washu was staring at a window on the screen of
her smoky black laptop. The window showed Samantha seated down and
awaiting the fanfic. Beside her were Shampoo and Rei, and behind them
were the many patrons of the Club Anipike, including owner and operator,
Misato, all waiting for the fanfic to be MSTied.

"You think Samantha survive this?" Shampoo asked, seated on Washu's
left.

"Of course she will! She was doing this a long time before any of us
started!" Washu replied. But her enthusiasm was forced. The fanfic was
wrong in nearly every way and she doubted that even Samantha's strong
mind could handle it.

"Washu's right," Rei said, seated to Washu's right. "She can survive
this."

The scientist nodded and types in some commands. A microphone suddenly
appeared out of a subspace hole and she talked into it. "Ready to go,
Samantha?"

"I'll be as ready as I'll ever be!" came the reply.

"Good. Good luck to you!" Everyone in the club shouted their wishes and
good luck as well. Typing in some more commands, the window containing
the live feed of Samantha winked out and the fanfic started up.

>It occured to me that Kagato never got his revenge on Tenchi and the
others
>for his defeat.

SAMANTHA: That's probably because he's dead.

>Here now is the continuing saga of the evil space villain
>Kagato.....

SAMANTHA: <announcer's voice> And here we have the continuing saga of
the cub lion as he learns to hunt and kill for his supper...

>                             KAGATO'S REVENGE

SAMANTHA: The next frontier!

>by Washu 6/10/97

SAMANTHA: Hmmm... Wonder if I can borrow Washu's time machine after
this.

>______________________________________________________________________>___

SAMANTHA: They *still* haven't completed that double highway?

>  It was a beautiful spring day and Ryo-ohki was bounding through the
carrot
>patch with cheerful meows for everyone.

SAMANTHA: <Ryo-oh-ki- voice> Here's one for you... and one for you...

>Tenchi was busy shovelling dirt
>for the new vegitable patch. Sasami and Mihoshi were planting seed
>in the freshly hoed rows of dirt.

SAMANTHA: <Bob Vila voice> Next time, on this old garden...

>  Sasami looked up from her work and wipped her brow. She took a moment

>to survey the day's accomplishments. She watched Tenchi on the far side

>of the field. He was busy digging. Off in one corner of the garden,
Ryoko
>and Aeka were having a screaming match. Sasami sighed. So what
>else is new? she thought.

SAMANTHA: Well, for starters, you forgot the " at the beginning and end
of your thought.

>  Ryo-ohki hopped up with a fresh carrot in her mouth. "Meow, meow,
>meow!!!" she said loudly. Sasami looked down and frowned.

SAMANTHA: What is it Lassie? Timmy got trapped in the mine again? Leave
him there, the stupid idiot.

>  "Have you been eating the fresh carrots again Ryo-Ohki?" Tenchi
>won't be very happy about that pleased. Ryo-Ohki looked at her
forlornly.

SAMANTHA: 'Forornly'? Hang on here... <takes out a dictionary and looks
in it> Ah! So Sasami looked at the cabbit lonely... This is going to be
a long one.

>  Suddenly, a dark shadow loomed above their heads. Everyone looked up
>to see a giant spacecraft hovering over the field. Without warning,
>a blast of green light engulfed them all. Tenchi yelled out Sasami's
>name. It was the last thing that Sasami heard before she lost
conciousness....

SAMANTHA: And it's a shame she can't stay that way the rest of the
fanfic.

>  Sasami awoke with a start. Her head was spinning

SAMANTHA: Well you had better grab it before it rolls off!

>and she felt dazed. She
>was lying on her back, strapped securely to an operating table.

SAMANTHA: Geez! those Organ Donor programs sure have gotten rough as of
late!

>When she
>tried to move her arms, they wouldn't budge. She looked around the room

>in terror, trying to make sense of her predicament.

SAMANTHA: Oh!!! Such big words!

>  The room was large and white like an operating room. She was confused

>and desperately tried to free her hands.

SAMANTHA: <singing> Hands up! Baby, hands up! Give me your heart, gimme,
gimme...

>  Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room.

SAMANTHA: <deep voice> Luke, *I* am your father.

>"Well Sasami, it seems that I
>will have my revenge at last!" Sasami recognized Kagato's cruel and
evil
>voice. She looked around the room in terror and confusion.

SAMANTHA: So Kagato just showed up like that. No big god person bringing
them back, no clone, no future or past time self, just came back... Oh
well! At least it's better then some of those other plot devices used!

>  A heartless laugh reverberated through the room. "I've been waiting
>for you Sasami..." Kagato cackled. "I've been so looking forward
>to our next encounter!"

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> I am going to teach you how to combine primary
elements to make fissionable nuclear material.

>   Sasami was terrified. She squirmed and strained against the
>strong clamps that held her wrists and ankles to the table. A
>huge screen descended from the ceiling.

SAMANTHA: Oh right! Pay-per-view!

>On it was as taunting image
>of Kagato's face. His evil glare looked down at her from above.

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> I'm not touching you. Does this bug you?

>  "Now you can see me watching you little one!" he grinned "You will
>be able to see the joy in my face as I submit your young body to
>HELL!"

SAMANTHA: You're gonna show her Full House reruns?

>Kagato touched a button and his image was replaced by a mirror
>reflection of Sasami clamped to the table. "See how pretty you are
>my dear?" he said with a sarcastic grin. "You can see absolutely
>everyting that is happening to you."

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> Including my lack of H's.

>  Without warning, the wall at her left opened up and a cluster of evil

>looking machinery slid forth from the darkness. The mechanical
nightmare
>hummed to life as Kagato pushed the buttons on his controller madly.

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> BWAHAHAHAHA *BREAK* Ah, damn!

>  Sasami gasped in horror as she watched metallic tentacles writh and
>twitch as the machinery unfolded above her.

SAMANTHA: Whoa! When did we cross into OverFiend?

>Silvery metal tentacles
>with various probes and needles moved into place above the operating
>table. One of the evil metal worms boasted a horrific electric sawblade

>which hummed quietly.

SAMANTHA: Huuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....

>Sasami shuddered in terror.
>  Kagato laughed insanely as the torture tentacles hovered over Sasami.

>  "Now you will see what pain and torment really mean!" he cackled
>sadistically. Sasami's eyes welled up with tears and frustration.
>  "Please let me go!!" she begged. Kagato just smirked and glared
>at her evily.

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> I'm evil kid. I don't let people go.

>  "Not until you've paid the price for my defeat at the hands of your
>friends!"

SAMANTHA: So Sasami pays for Kagato's defeat at the hands of Tenchi...
Doesn't he make sense!

>   Sasami whimpered aprehensively as she watched the torture tentacles
>squirm above her. Kagato pressed a button on his control pad and
suddenly
>the silver tentacles came to life. Sasami gasped in horror as a
tentacle
>descended to the table where she was held captive. At the tip of the
tentacle
>was what seemed to be a tiny sawblade.

SAMANTHA: That fiend! He's going to take your tonsils out before you get
a sore throat!

>   As Sasami watched in horror, the blade began to rotate faster and
faster
>until a loud hum emminated from the cruel device. The tentacle suddenly

>moved lower down on her body and out of Sasami's line of sight. Her
eyes
>grew wide in terror and she clenched her fists together in anticipation

>of what was going to happen.
>   She yelped aloud as she heared the sound of the blade begin cutting
into
>the fabric of her pretty blue dress.

SAMANTHA: <dumb voice> Uh... pretty blue dress.

>She shook her head violently in
>desperate protest. The tentacle slowly eased the sawblade up her thigh,

>rending the delecate fabric of her clothes.

SAMANTHA: So Kagato has become a expert seamstress...

>   Through tears in her eyes, Sasami saw another tentacle descend from
>the metallic cluster hovering above her. The new metal worm had shiny
>grippers like pointed pinchers attached to the end of it.

SAMANTHA: <turning slightly green> If those go where I thank they are...

>The vile

SAMANTHA: I know the content of the fanfic, thank you.

>looking pointed fingers of the gripper opened and closed mennacingly
>with a metallic click.

SAMANTHA: CLICK!

>   The sawblade slowly worked its way up to Sasami's waist. Every few
>inches, it made a little nick in her flesh causing her to cry out
>As the blade reached her pretty belt, it viciously sawwed into it
>slicing the fabric in two.

SAMANTHA: Accidentally killing her and thus ending the fanfic. <waits
for a few seconds> Damn.

>   Sasami could feel the sting of the mini cuts that the spinning
>blade had caused on her soft thighs. Her tears of pain and fright
>poured down the sides of her face.

SAMANTHA: And the thoughts of brutal acts on the author arose in my
mind.

>   The gripper tentacle clasped her shredded blue dress and slowly
>pulled the two halves apart revealing what was underneath.

SAMANTHA: Wow! I never knew that Sasami had such a boss tan.

>Sasami's
>lacy blue panties were exposed now. Here beautiful young legs showed
>the tiny cuts inflicted by the sawblade.

SAMANTHA: <getting angry> And just who are we typing about? Playmate of
the month?

>Little trickles of blood
>ran down the sides of her thighs from the many small wounds.
>   Sasami's cheeks grew flushed as Kagato eyed her bare legs.

SAMANTHA: <Akane voice> PERVET!

>"What a pretty young thing you are.." he cackled. "The very thought
>of defiling your flesh makes my heart soar!"

SAMANTHA: Okay, I knew he was dark, but he ain't sadistic! Kagato is
sure gonna have some words with the author after this.

>He continued pressing
>buttons on his controller and more tentacles descended from the
>mechanical cluster of evil.

SAMANTHA: The mechanical cluster of evil... <sarcastic voice> how
original.

>   The sawblade tentacle began cutting up Sasami's delecate blouse.
>She cried out as the blade cut viciously into the tender flesh of
>her tummy.

SAMANTHA: Oh yuck!

>The gripper tentacle yanked at her clothes, tearing the
>fabric and exposing more of her soft flesh to the eyes of her
>tormentor.
>    Sasami's tears welled to weeping as she sobbed in frustration
>and terror. The sawblade finished its vile work and the gripper
>stripped her of the last remnant of her shredded outer clothing.

SAMANTHA: No will be seated during the intense shredding of the clothing
scene... In fact, no one would be seated because everyone would have
left!

>    Kagato watched in delight as Sasami blushed and struggled.

SAMANTHA: Blushing would be the last thing I would do!

>Her lacy blue bra was exposed now, hiding her budding young breats.

SAMANTHA: And here we have a twelve year old stacked like something out
of a Hustler magazine.

>She looked up at Kagato's taunting image on the screen above her.
>Sasami felt ashamed at her bareness and her cheeks flushed as she
>tried to turn away from his gaze.

SAMANTHA: <getting bitter> You could close your eyes. Ever think of
that?

>    The naughty metallic tentacles now descended in a cluster of
>lust. Sasami gasped as the probes snaked and writhed all over her
>body. The cold metal of the machine worms made her muscles tense.

SAMANTHA: Okay, *now* we've crossed over into OverFiend! Geez, first
B-ko and now Kagato! Doesn't anyone have any sense of originality
anymore?

>    A metal probe criss-crossed her upper body, poking at her young
>breats and chilling Sasami's flesh. It slid underneath her bra clasp
>at the center of her chest and violently yanked outward.

SAMANTA: <Sasami voice> OUCH!

>She gasped
>as the lacy blue satin was torn from her chest. Her soft pretty
>breasts were exposed now. Her little pink nipples were hard and
>her cheeks grew red in embarrassment.

SAMANTHA: And my cheeks grew red in rage.

>    More metallic tentacles carressed her neck and wrapped around
>her pretty blue hair.

SAMANTHA: This fanfic has so far surpassed any of those other Sasami
lemons I've been hearing about.

>Sasami writhed and fought against her bonds
>as the tentacles wrapped themselves around her little tits.

SAMANTHA: Wrapped around what? She's a wooden board for crying out loud!

>The
>cold steel of the probes made her tiny pink nipples grow harder
>as they tickled and carressed Sasami's naked chest.

SAMANTHA: <turning slightly green> I will not stop, I will not stop I
will not...

>    Other evil metal worms were getting to work on her lower half.
>Cold probes of steel were wrapping themselves around Sasami's bare
>legs. They slithered and wriggled around her thighs, wrapping her
>pretty legs tightly.

SAMANTHA: *CRUNCH* <Sasami voice> AHH!!!

>To her horror, the tentacles began to pull
>Sasami's legs apart, spreading her thighs and exposing the crotch
>of her lacy blue panties.

SAMANTHA: But weren't they holding them tightly... Ah forget it!

>   Sasami cried out "Oh NO!" as the naughty worms held her legs
>open for Kagato to admire. "Please... oh please!" she begged.
>   "Quiet now lovely one..." Kagato whispered. His image on the
>screen above her was as cold as the tentacles. He glared at her
>with a look of pure hate.

SAMANTHA: <sarcastic voice> And here I thought it would be lust. How
silly of me.

>   As the tentacles on her chest slowly molested her pretty tits,

SAMANTHA: Sasami called out rape and Kagato was hit with a dozen
lawsuits.

>a new metal worm broke off from the rest and positioned itself
>over Sasami's face. It wiggled infront of her eyes, nodding in
>a lifelike way, then suddenly plunged into her mouth without
>warning.

SAMANTHA: Oh man, this fanfic is gonna make me gag if it keeps going
this way.

>Sasami gasped and gagged as the intruder invaded her
>young mouth.

SAMANTHA: Yes, young mouth. Thank you author! I now have the idea firmly
in my mind that she is young!!!

>She clutched at her bonds in horror as the silver
>worm violently penetrated her throught.
>   Sasami's warm saliva coated the tentacle, making it slippery
>and warm. It plunged down her throught, raping her mouth slowly
>with metal.

SAMANTHA: How does one rape a mouth? *BURP* Nevermind, I think I just
found out.

>Sasami gagged and fought against it, but the tentacle
>continued to force its way into her throat. It began to gently
>pump her mouth, violating her lips profanely and probing the
>interior of her throat.

SAMANTHA: And ripping her insides apart considering how far down they
were. God, how many authors think women are hollow? Am I going to see
*four* tentacles being forced in her mouth now?

>   The tentacles at the lower half of her body kept her legs
>tightly spread as new probes positioned themselves infront of
>Sasami's exposed crotch.

SAMANTHA: Uh...

>A tentacle slipped under the lacy
>blue elastic of her panties and squirmed over her virgin
>pussy.

SAMANTHA: Oh my god! A part of the clothing on her body not brutally
ripped apart! How amazing!

>Sasami arched her back in protest as more tentacles
>slipped under her panties and probed her female secrets.

SAMANTHA: Ack! Not only is it more then four, but he's making it seem
like a dozen! A guy *has* to be writing this!

   One of the tentacles exerted force on the satin fabric
>of her panties and the lacy garment ripped open, exposing
>her soft bush of blue pubic hair.

SAMANTHA: Oh well, so much for *that* piece of clothing not being ripped
apart, considering it would be already from all the tentacles... *BURP*
<wraps arms around stomach> Hoo boy.

>A tentacle rubbed over
>her pussy, pressing against her little clit and causing
>Sasami to moan softly.

SAMANTHA: How can she moan, what with that tentacle in her mouth?

>    The tentacles spread her legs wider and opened her
>pussy to more exploration. A metal worm gently carressed her
>soft clit, sending tingles through Sasami's body. It
>rubbed back and forth against her little nub, causing
>her clit to swell and burn with pleasure.

SAMANTHA: Whoa! Someone get a fire extinguisher!

>   Sasami tried to cry out, but the slippery metal phallus
>in her mouth prevented her from screaming. She gagged
>slowly as the worm continued to rape her tight throat.

SAMANTHA: 'Tight' throat? Does the author think women are compressed or
something?

>   The tentacles below held her legs tightly

SAMANTHA: *CRACK* <Sasami voice> AHH!!!

>as the
>metal worm continued its onslaught

SAMANTHA: <turning slightly green again> Yuck, don't use onslaught.

>on Sasami's virgin
>clit. A trickle of vaginal fluid was slowly coating
>Sasami's young pussy. The metal worms became slippery
>and warm as they slipped back and forth across her
>damp bush.

SAMANTHA: <announcer's voice> The Sasami shrubbery can only be found in
these warm, moist climates...

>   Two tentacles pressed against her pussy lips, spreading
>them open and exposing her vagina to the intruding worms.
>A tentacle gently carressed the her pussy and Sasami squirmed
>in frustration. The tentacle slipped inside her and began
>to probe the interior of her virgin pussy.

SAMANTHA: No, I will not do a Uranus joke... not here, not now.

>It thrust into
>her more violently and began to writhe and pump itself
>faster and faster.
>   Suddenly, Sasami noticed that the tentacles inside of
>her were growing increasingly warm.

SAMANTHA: And Samantha noticed her urge to kill the author was growing
more and more uncontrollable.

>The one raping her pussy
>began to slide in and out of her wetly. It's slippery metal
>squirmed and pumped her pussy with viciousness.

SAMANTHA: *winces*

>It penetrated

SAMANTHA: Don't use that word either.

>her deeply, exploring the far recesses of her vagina with each
>thrust. It tickled her cervix, causing a spasm in Sasami's
>lower half.

SAMANTHA: So now the author took to looking up words in a dictionary.

>  The tentacle raping her mouth was getting warm as well.
>It heated up her tongue as it quickly thrust against the
>back of her throat. The tentacle was slimey and wet with
>her saliva and tasted metallic. It made Sasami wince and gag.

SAMANTHA: Just like this fanfic is making me do.

>    A new tentacle pushed its way inside her pussy, coming

SAMANTHA: Oh, bad choice of words.

>alongside the first one. Sasami arched her back in torment
>as her pussy was stretched widely. The first vaginal tentacle
>had begun to wriggle inside her womb, pushing past her cervix
>and violating her womanhood profanely. It squeezed into
>her womb violently and explored the dark recesses of her flesh.

SAMANTHA: For the last frigging time! TWELVE YEAR OLDS DON'T STRETCH
LIKE THAT!!!

>   The second tentacle inside her pussy continued pumping and
>writhing as a new metal worm placed its pinchers on Sasami's
>clit.

SAMANTHA: *winces* Oh man...

>It grasped the little pink nub tightly and began to
>vibrate with an electric hum.
>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as pleasure burned through her clit.
>In spite of the violent metallic torture, the clit vibrator
>was sending tingles through her whole body. It pressed against
>her clit, holding itself tightly against Sasami's virgin nub.
>   Soon, she felt a hot flash of pleasure ripple through her
>pussy.

SAMANTHA: It was the end of the fanfic.

>She gasped and arched as tingles vibrated through her
>lower half. The tentacle raping her mouth withdrew itself slowly
>from her violated throat. As it escaped her lips, it left a hot
>trail of sticky saliva in its wake.

SAMANTHA: <holding stomach, again> Wrong liquid you idiot. Salivia ain't
sticky.

>   Sasami gasped for breath and moaned aloud. She writhed and
>arched her back as the vibrating tentacle nailed her little
>clit. "Oh...ooooooo.." she moaned in frustration. She closed
>her eyes tightly and clenched her fists. Wave after wave of
>burning pleasure tore through her clit and she cried out.

SAMANTHA: Where is that fire extinguisher?

>  "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...!!!!" she moaned as her pussy spasmed
>with pleasure. Her clit burned in a white-hot climax as the
>tentacles inside her grew slippery and wet with her female
>juices.

SAMANTHA: Female juices! New at your grocery store!

>   Sasami shuddered and sighed deeply as her climax subsided.
>She went limp and the tentacle removed the vibrating clamp from
>her clit.
>    Kagato grinned on the screen above.

SAMANTHA: <Kagato voice> I'm a deeply offending pervert, but I'm sorry.
The author has me written that way.

>Through her tears,
>Sasami could see his evil smile. "Are you ready to taste
>true torture?" he asked wickedly.

SAMANTHA: So *now* the torture is about to begin. Oh joy...

>Sasami moaned and sighed
>as the tentacles inside her continued to rape her young body.
>Kagato pressed a key on his touchpad and all hell broke lose.

SAMANTHA: Samantha burst into the author's house and proceeded to beat
the crap out of him!

>    More metallic tentacles descended from the cluster above
>Sasami's table. The new ones were equiped with unimaginable
>devices of torture. Phalluses

SAMANTHA: 'Phalluses'? What the hell is that?

>of every shape and size. Long
>needles and blades that were shiny and viciously sharp.

SAMANTHA: <takes out sword> Okay, my sword is sharp enough. The better
to slice bad author's computers with...

>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as she watched the torture tentacles
>descend to her body. They encircled her with their twisted
>devices and slowly nodded at her as if to taunt her with
>lust and torture.

SAMANTHA: <very dark> I sure as hell won't be taunting the author when I
catch him...

>   Two tentacles with nasty looking clamps descended on her
>breasts. The clamps fit perfectly around Sasami's hard pink
>nipples. She looked up at the screen above her and watched
>in horrific anticipation of what would happen.
>   Without warning, two sharp steel spikes pierced her nipples.
>Sasami screamed out loud and tensed her muscles in agony. The
>clamps inserted a long steel nail into each nipple and blood
>gushed from the puncture wounds.

SAMANTHA: AHH!!! That's it! The stupid author dies when I get my hands
on him!

>The tentacles rose from her
>chest, leaving the two silver spikes inserted into her breasts.

SAMANTHA: <clutching chest> This is just so wrong on so many levels...

>    The silver nails stung terribly and Sasami moaned in pain and
>confusion. Another tentacle like the first two descended to
>her spread pussy. It clamped down on her clit and squeezed.
>Sasami squirmed violently and the tentacles held her tight.
>The tentacle clamp pierced Sasami's clit with a silver stee
>nail just like the ones that punctured her breats.

SAMANTHA: An erotic lemon of torture and the damn author can't even type
breast correctly.

>   "AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!"Sasami screamed at the top of her lungs
>as a feeling like fire burned her clit. The pain was
>excrusiating.

SAMANTHA: I fee your pain, Sasami.

>   Suddenly, her restraints we unlocked and her hands came free
>from the table. The tentacles held her tightly in their grip
>and slowly turned her over onto her stomach. Sasami struggled
>and fought with the metal worms, but whe was held fast.

SAMANTHA: Oh no. I heard something like this from Shion. Please don't
let this go there...

>   She moaned as she lay face down on the table. Her cheek sat
>in a little pool of a mixture of her own blood and saliva. The
>clamps locked her wrists and ankles again, keeping her trapped
>to the torture table. A tentacle wrapped itself around her waist
>and lifted her ass into the air while forcing her head to lie on
>the table. The soft flesh of her young ass was bare and exposed
>to the tentacles now.

SAMANTHA: Oh god! Not anal sex! On a twelve year old! FOR CRYING OUT
LOUD, DOESN'T THE AUTHOR HAVE ANY SENSE OF DIGNITY!!! AAAARRRGGHH!!!

>   Two of them spread her ass cheeks and held them open to attack.

SAMANTHA: Brilliant wording there, Sherlock.

>A third vibrating phallus slipped wetly across Sasami's back.
>She moaned in pain and exhaustion, nearly unconcious and feeling
>the painful burning sting of the steel needles in her nipples
>and clit.

SAMANTHA: I can feel my eyes burning right now, I swear I can.

>  The snake-like metal probe tickled her exposed asshole and
>slowly began to penetrate Sasami's back door.

SAMANTHA: First she's a hollow tube, then shrubbery, and now a house.
Make up your mind!

>She winced in
>pain as it slipped wetly into her tight ass, probing and
>tickling all the way.

SAMANTHA: *winces*

>It writhed and squirmed inside her
>colon, pushing in farther and farther.
>  Sasami's cheeks flushed redly. She was so tired and hurt,
>but she still knew that Kagato was watching her rape-torture
>and loving every second.

SAMANTHA: I sure as hell ain't!!!

>   The anal tentacle rape continued as the worm explored deeper
>into her cavaties. It reamed and pumped her tight ass as blood
>trickled down her thighs from her torn anus. Sasami sighed
>deeply and moaned, eyes half shut.

SAMANTHA: And I moaned at the pure crap being written and contemplated
various methods of death for the author.

>   The tentacle began to vibrate and pump her ass with greater
>speed. More tentacles went to work on Sasami, poking at the
>steel spikes in her nipples, causing her to wince. Tears
>welled at her eyes and she yelped as a vibrating clamp attached
>itself to the clit spike and began to torture her pierced flesh.

SAMANTHA: Tortured, the perfect term for anyone forced to watch this
crap.

>   Her clit felf like it was on fire as the clamp vibrated the
>clit spike. Her nipples burned redly as the vibro-clamps tortured
>her soft tits. A small stream of blood droplets trickled from her
>impaled, violated tits. A red pool was collecting beneath her on
>the torture table.

SAMANTHA: <weakly> Spill on Isle twelve.

>   The anal tentacle thrust deeply into her and out again, making
>Sasami squeal and clutch at the table. The clit clamp vibrated
>faster, sending hot flashes of pain and pleasure through her body.
>Her nipples burned and ached as the clamps twisted the needles
>inside her. She screamed again as the needles twisted and rotated.
>Sasami was in terrible agony. Her little tits felt like they
>were on fire.

SAMANTHA: My *mind* is on fire.

>   She felt her clit burn with screaming pleasure as the tentacle
>clamp vibrated the clit needle. Her pussy spasmed and her anus
>contracted, squeezing the tentacle in her ass. She felt herself
>drifting off, losing concious control and seperating herself from
>her own body.

SAMANTHA: <mumbling> I would like to separate someone's head from their
body.

>   Her clit screamed with pleasure as the vibration continued.
>She closed her eyes, lifted her head and moaned softly. She arched
>her back and cried out "OOOOOoooohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!" as she climaxed
>violently.

SAMANTHA: I know this is rape and all, but do you have to keep using
violent all the time?

>   The tentacle in her ass twisted and pumped, insulting her tight
>asshole as her hot orgasm tore through her.

SAMANTHA: <Tentacle> You call this an anus? Why, I've seen better sewer
openings then this!

>The tentacle clamps
>pulled viciously at her nipple piercings, stretching her young
>blood-stained tits. As Sasami screamed in orgasm and pain,
>the tentacle clamps powerfully yanked the nipple needles from
>her tits. They violently ripped from her nipples, tearing huge, deep
>gashes in her tits as they exited her flesh.

SAMANTHA: AH!!! SHE'S A TWELVE YEAR OLD!!! WHEN I GET MY HANDS ON YOU,
I'LL RIP YOU APART LIMB FROM LIMB YOU DAMN AUTHOR!!!

>   Sasami gasped and gagged in pain as her screaming orgasm
>subsided. Her breasts hurt like the devil.

SAMANTHA: <calmed down> I would think so after having them ripped off...
*burp* Hoo boy. I am going to need *so* much alcohol after this...
JAMIE: <appears> I'll buy. I'm as sick as you are!
SAMANTHA: Arigatoo.

>Blood cascaded
>from her chest and covered the table below her. She sighed
>deeply, then collapsed into unconciousness....

SAMANTHA: Which is what I would do if I didn't have such an iron
constitution.

>  Kagato smiled and retracted the tentacles from her body. The slimey
>metal worms were covered in blood, saliva and cum. Sasami lay on
>the table, motionless. Kagato checked her bio-readout and saw that
>she was still alive. Good, he thought, we'll have some more fun
>later sweet one...

SAMANTA: Sasami now comes in Strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate!

>   He walked past the torture table, leaving Sasami in a pathetic
>heap. He opened a side door and exited the torture room, leaving
>the mess behind him.

SAMANTHA: After all, that was what the maid was for.

>   The new room he entered was exactly like the first. Accross the
>room was a torture table exactly like Sasami's. Lying face up on
>the table was another woman, clamped down the way Sasami had been.
>Kagato strode brazenly up to the new victim and looked her in the
>eyes.
>   "Shall we begin my dear, dear Aeka?" He laughed evilly and
>went to work again....

SAMANTHA: Again? With Aeka? YOU FIEND!!! ARRGGHH!!!

>THE END?

SAMANTHA: It had better be, after what I went through!

SAMANTHA: <growling, eyes blazing red> Naughty Tentacles. Why am I not
surprised? <gets up and leaves>
                                *               *               *
Washu watched as the display it 100 % and she called up the video feed.
Amazingly, the theater was in one piece, not a single seat broken or the
walls cinched with Ki blasts.

"Where Samantha?" Shampoo asked.

Everyone in the club chorused that question and were immediately
answered when the huge double doors to the club were slammed opened.
Many people gasped when they saw Samantha standing there, silhouetted by
the light from outside and her eyes blazing an intense red.

Without speaking to anyone, she walked up to the bar and jumped over it.
Jotarou Joestar went to stop her, but Misato shook her head. Quickly
scanning the various bottles of alcohol on the racks, Samantha pulled
out a large bottle of whiskey and ripped the cap off with her teeth.

Then, to everyone's amazement, she downed the entire bottle, all thirty
two ounces of it.

When she was done, Samantha slammed the bottle on the bar, being careful
not to break it, and looked out over the various anime characters, her
eyes having reverted back to their normal color.

"THAT is what you would have to do to get the taste of the fanfic out of
your mouth," Samantha finally said, wiping away the bit of whiskey
spilled on her cheek. "For that lemon has to be *the* most wrongest,
horrible, Sasami lemon ever written. And when I get my hands on the
author..."

Her review of the fanfic finished and the full impact of the whiskey
hitting her hard, Samantha's eyes rolled up in her head and she passed
out. She would have hit the floor had Joestar not been there to catch
her.

"That bad, eh?" Washu said.
