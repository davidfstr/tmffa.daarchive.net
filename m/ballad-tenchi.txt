The Ballad of Ryoko and Tenchi
By, Clayton Overstreet


Ryoko awoke early one Spring to ind a boy in her cave,
The boy she had loved,
And continued to love,
Whom she would gladly join as a slave.
Then light from the sword burned her face,
Broke her mask,
How she felt it's best not to ask.

So some games she would play with this lucky young fool,
She fought him some time,
Then blew up his school.
Still he didn't like her,
Despite her fun games.
So she followed him hom,
He remembered her name!

Next she lay in his bed and asked for his balls,
He seemed surprised so she put off the cat calls.
Grabbing his sword with lust in her eyes,
He seemed to be hiding it,
So she rubbed at his thighs.
Suddenly Aeka on Ryo-oki's scanners appeared,
She told him and told him,
But he didn't want to hear.

First came the blast in his yard,
Don't you wish you had listenend?
You are such a retard.
So quick as can be he folded like a card,
He gave her a gem back,
Now was that so hard?
Ryo-okiu arose from the lake like a ship,
In Ryoko's mind she asked, "Who is this skinny dip?"
"Shut up you dumb cabbit, he's the love of my life."
Ryo-oki laughed thinking of her as a wife.


Tenchi and her were captured quick enough,
Though if you watch the show later you'll assume it was a bluff.
Still an interesting fight came and it ended right back in the lake,
Aeka was scared but only for her sake.
Tenchi, the kind hearted sap that he was,
Said they could say though Ryoko made a fuss.
Noboyuki was fine,
Especially when Sasami started to cook,
As they started to dine,
He gave the girls a leacherous look.
"Tenchi he asked," As he laughed merrily.
"Which are you getting and which are for me?"

The girls did hit him,
As the punishment is know.
This is anime after all,
Be glad they didn't break a bone.
Yosho was bright enough to leave them alone.
Next came Mihoshi.
While they were at the baths.
A demon was summoned and we had some laughs.
Ryoko was naked,
How could we forget?
Aeka was uncovered and we saw all of it.
And how she reacted to Ryo-oki's egg, the twit. .

Then Kagato came to take Ryoko and more,
He slapped her around and called her a whore.
Tenchi pleaded for him to let her go.
He begged and he screamed,
The prick still said no.
Yosho fought Ryoko to set her free,
Then he let Kagato get zapped, he he.
The madman left with Ryoko alone,
Swearing vengence by all that is known.
Ryoko woke up and screamed to be free,
Kagato just laughted,
And waited for Tenchi.

Down on the planet Yosho was revieled,
But he pretended to be old,
Gods what a heel!
Sending Tenchi off to get himself blasted,
The stinking coward stayed home and got himself plastered.
Noboyuki was at work this entire time,
I only mentioned it cause it's been on my mind.
Where was he and where did he go?
He was earning a living to pay for the holes.
So up in the spaceship everyone fought,
Mihoshi freed Washu,
Boy is she hot.
Two snaked turned to dust,
Kagato cut in two,
Aeka apparently weak,
And the spaceship's broke too.

Back on th planet who else would appear?
Nagi, Yugi, maybe Sakuya too?
Hell no, none of them was here,
Mayuka and Kiyone might show up later but never fear.
So now all these girls are hitting on Tenchi,
He turned them all down,
He's not gay is he?
The inbreeding Princess got him alone,
In a cabin he had out by his home.
Or was that before Kagato got there?
I can't remember,
But do you really care?

Then Dr. Clay arrived with Zero his pet,
She fell in love with Tenchi,
Oh gee who could have seen that?
He got his butt kicked by Mihoshi and Washu,
So he dumped them in space despite what Tokimi told him to do.
Old Octopus head was frozen in ice,
Tokimi talked to a floating head,
Man she looks nice.
So questions unanswered,
Stood standing there,
Who is that guy in the shadow,
And what's with his hair?

That's about it,
Minus the fight with Serio,
The pink haired wuss got wet,
Then the Royal family had to go.
They'll be back,
Don't worry,
Funaho said so.
As I am writting this plans have been made,
To get the new OVA out,
And get AIC paid.
I'm gonna buy it as soon as I can,
Just to see if Ryoko makes Tenchi a man.

Author's note

  Well I hadn't done a poem yet and this seemed to sum it up rather nicely.
