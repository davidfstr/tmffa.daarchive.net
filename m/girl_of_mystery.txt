        "I'm telling you, I saw her!" a boy says to his classmates.  In the
classroom, everyone seems to be interested.

        "Then, who is she, Hiroto?" his friend asks.

        Looking down, "I don't know.  I've never seen her before.  But, she was
awfully cute."

        Wrapping around him, "forget her, Hiroto.  You already got me!"

        Pulling her off, "go away, Konoha!"

        "Where did you see her, Hiroto?"

        "I was walking home, when I saw her across the street.  She looked more
like a traditional girl, actually.  She was waiting at the bus stop with
some bags, and an older woman."

        "What did she look like?"

        "She was about my age, with long blue hair in a pair of pony-tails, and
pink eyes.  She was wearing a green kimono with gold and black in it."

        "And what about the older one?"

        "She was probably as old as my mom, from the looks of her.  She had her
hair in spikes, but it was silver colored.  She wasn't dressed as
traditional, but she seemed to be close to the girl."

        "I've seen her before!  She and this other lady with purple hair are
often staggering down the sidewalk.  I think they live in that house out
of town."

        "That one by the lake?"

        "That's probably why the little girl had to use the bus," Hiroto says.
"She must live out there, too.  Well, whoever she is, I'd really like to
know her."

        Konoha looks at him furiously, "oh, no you don't!  You're mine,
remember?"

        "No, I don't, Konoha.  I never was, and never will be yours."

        The teacher walks in, "alright, kids.  Let's get started."

        Hiroto sits down, <I really want to know her.>

=-=-=-=-=

        Walking home, Hiroto passes the bus stop where he saw the girl
yesterday.  Looking across the street, he sees nobody around.  "Hmm.
Not here today."  Looking down the sidewalk, he sees a familiar form.
"There she is!"  Running for the girl, he sees her turn.

        "Hello!" she says cheerfully.

        "You're the girl I saw yesterday!  I hoped to see you again.  I'm
Hiroto."

        "Well, after yesterday, I had to see you again."

        "Why is that?  And, what is your name?"

        "Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm Sasami.  But, as for your other question, I have
an interesting story for that."

=-=-=-=-=

Yesterday

        As Sasami is watching the boy walk down the road, she can see his eyes
are glued on her.  "Who is that, I wonder?"

        "Looks like you've got an admirer, Sasami," Ryoko says.

        "What?"

        "I can just see it now.  10 years later, you and him could be
together."

        "Ryoko!  Stop!"

        "You know, if I were your age, I would have probably chased him down
the street."

        Turning a bit red, "I'm never gonna hear the end of this.  I just know
it."

=-=-=-=-=

        Arriving at the house, "we're home!"  Sasami shouts.

        "Hey!  Ayeka!  Have I got some news for you!"

        <Oh no!> Sasami thinks, shrinking a bit.  <I'm doomed!>

        "What is it?" Ayeka responds, entering.

        Putting her hands on Sasami's shoulders, she prevents her escape.  "It
seems someone has a crush on Sasami."

        "That's not true!" she says, turning shades of red.

        "Sure it is.  I saw the way that boy looked at you.  Maybe you should
do something for him on Sunday."

        "What's Sunday?" Ayeka asks.

        Sasami just grimaces at the thought.

        "Why, Sunday is Valentine's Day."

        Tenchi walks into the room, curious.  "So, who is he?"

        "I don't know," Sasami finally says.

        "Well, maybe you should find out," he responds.

        "He was probably walking home," Ryoko adds, "which means he'll be
walking by again tomorrow."

        Sasami turns white, "you're not thinking-"

        "Why not?" Ayeka adds.  "If he does like you, he's probably going to
haunt you for awhile."

        "Tomorrow," Ryoko says, "I'll take you into town.  You should meet him,
Sasami."

        "Yes, Sasami," Ayeka adds, "it would do you good to find someone your
own age."

        "But-" Sasami stammers, "-I don't know."

        "Don't worry, Sasami," Ryoko says, "we'll be close by to help you out."

        "That's what I was afraid of."

        "Don't worry about it, Sasami," Tenchi says.  "I'm sure he's a nice
boy.  Who knows?  Given a few years-"

        "Tenchi!" Sasami shouts.

        "Oh, come on," he says, "we're just joking.  But, seriously, I think
you should meet with him.  Maybe he does like you.  And, it would be
nice for you to make some new friends."

        Sasami just looks at him oddly.  <This from someone who can't decide
between two girls in front of him.>

        <And if the two do become a couple,> Ayeka thinks, <then that would
leave Tenchi for me.>

        <If Sasami and this kid do hit it off,> Ryoko thinks, <then she won't
get in the way when I want to take Tenchi.>

        Sasami looks at Ayeka and Ryoko and wonder why they're smiling like
they are.  <I can only guess...>

=-=-=-=-=

        Nervously, "so, that's what happened."

        "Well, I was hoping to meet you," he says, rubbing the back of his
head, nervously.  "So, who was that with you yesterday?  Your mom?"

        Laughing a bit, "no, she's not my mom.  She's more like an aunt.  She
lives with us."

=-=-=-=-=

        Watching nearby, Ryo-Ohki sees and hears the whole conversation.

        Through the mind-link to the cabbit, Ryoko can also see and hear
everything.  "He thought I was her mother?  Do I look that old?"

        Sitting nearby, "yes, you do," Ayeka answers.

        "I wasn't asking you."

=-=-=-=-=

        "Well, Sasami, it's been nice talking to you.  We should get together
sometime."

        Turning a little red, "uh, sure.  At least I know where to meet you."

        Pulling out a piece of paper, he scribbles on it.  Giving it to her,
"here.  This is my phone number.  It's a lot easier than meeting here."
Running off, "see you later, Sasami!"

        Ryo-Ohki drops down from her spot, "meow?"

        "What are you doing here?"

        Ryoko teleports in shortly afterward, "that went well, I presume."

        "Then, you saw-"

        "-everything.  So, are you going to call him?"

        Turning red, "I-I don't know.  He seems nice."

        "Well, I think you should.  You saw how he talked to you.  You don't
want to break his heart by not calling, do you?"

        "Well, no.  But, not right now."  The two then start to walk home.

        "I understand.  You're still young.  Besides, I'm sure he'll wait for
you."

        "Very funny."

-End?  Not bloody likely!-
