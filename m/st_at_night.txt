"SOMETIMES AT NIGHT"
______________________________________________________
_____

     Tenchi Masaki lay still in his bed.  Eyes open 
against the dark, he strained his senses, concentrating
on the sounds he could hear in the quiet night, 
listening to the trees rustling outside his window, and
listening to the sounds of the house.  Most everyone 
was asleep, or should be asleep.  So, for the most part
it was quiet.  But Tenchi lay fully awake clutching his
blankets to his neck.  He was waiting for something, 
and wasn't sure if his wait would be rewarded before 
sleep would take him.  But he was determined to wait it
out, if for no reason than to know that it was real, 
and that he was not crazy.  Because it would happen 
sometimes at night.

     He hadn't told the others.  Might never tell the 
others, but Tenchi had a suspicion that had been riding 
him for quite some time.  Of course, he didn't dwell on 
it, he didn't have the time.  But when he came to his 
room to wind down for bed, as he got undressed and 
slipped into his nightclothes, well, then he would have
to think.  He couldn't believe himself, really.  He 
knew it was so silly to think the way that he did, like
a child, maybe, and he remembered an age when he was 
still a boy and his mother was still alive.  At one 
time he had believed in monsters, and boogy-men, and 
just like many little boys and girls afrighted to the 
thought of being left alone in the dark.

     He smiled at the thought silently, and chided 
himself to not start laughing at the thought of it.  
He had to look like he was asleep.

     Sleep had finally almost taken Tenchi.  He was 
dozing now, after trying to count to himself to a 
thousand.  He was just realizing that he had said the 
same number in his head about three times, when he heard
the familar hum of space and matter shifting very close 
to him.  He sensed that he was no longer alone, and 
reflexively closed his eyes tight, trying again to 
pretend he was asleep.  But again, he was alert.

     His heart thudded in his chest, he focused on 
hearing and smelling and sensing the intruder.  She was
there, he knew, and his suspicions were completely 
confimed by a soft feminine sigh just above his left 
shoulder.

     "...Tenchi."  She breathed.  He tensed, thinking 
that maybe he was found out, but the intruder made no 
move or sound that she realized he was awake.  "You're 
such an angel when you're asleep, Ten-chi."  She 
emphasized his name, obviously playing on words her 
"angel" and heaven.  "...too bad you couldn't see 
yourself now."  Once again, he heard a shifting hum, 
and he braced himself for a confrontation or final 
peace.  Instead of either, and much to his surprise, 
the familiar phasing sound was at the same time much 
closer this time, and he quickly felt the side of 
his bed sinking with the weight of this person.
She was on his bed!  Praying silently to himself, 
he thanked the gods that he was curled up with his 
back to the room, and to the intruder, and that 
his nose hadn't begun to bleed.

     Ryoko Hakubi sighed silently to herself, 
breathing in Tenchi's good smell.  While she knew it
wasn't the brightest idea by far, she couldn't help 
herself by settling in on Tenchi's bed next to him.  
He was asleep anyway, she reasoned, and she'd be up
and out of his room before he could wake and nobody 
would be the wiser.  Though she toyed with the idea 
of letting Ayeka come to wake Tenchi and see them 
in bed, she dismissed it at least for the time being.  
In truth, she was too tired to focus on that.  Being 
careful not to wake him, and therefore laying 
at the very edge of the bed to avoid accidentally 
touching him (which she longed to do), she sent a 
telepathic request to her favorite pet, that the 
little cabbit wake her when it was time.  She loved 
these stolen moments with Tenchi, even if he himself 
didn't know that they happened.  As she drifted to 
sleep with this thought, she couldn't help but 
think that she heard his heart beating abnormally 
fast.  Sometimes she could almost think he waited...
yawning, she dismissed the idea before it could 
fully draw its conclusions.  Lying on top of the 
covers, she was soon fast asleep.

     Tenchi couldn't believe it.  His suspicions were 
confirmed as he surprised himself to no end by doing 
absolutely *nothing*.  He didn't stir and inch, and 
definately did not let on that he *knew* he wasn't 
alone.  He wasn't sure if it was an experiment or not
(Little Washu must be rubbing off on me, he thought
to that regard), but he finally knew that Ryoko did
more than just watched him sleep.  And he knew she 
did *less*.  

     It was weird, really, and for a while, he had
thought he was going crazy.  But for a long time, 
even after he had asked her to stay out of his room 
(which made him frown a bit), he would get the 
distinct feeling that he was not alone.  Like he 
was very intimately close to someone.  As though 
he was...married?  So close, that the person could 
not be anything less than a lover.  He didn't know 
where he got *that* idea from, but the end point 
had been evidence pointing to Ryoko.  Or delusions, 
he conceited.  Up till now, he had either been too 
deep in sleep to be roused by the feeling, or had 
waken up to find himself completely alone.  But 
the feeling would stay with him.  Feelings that 
he couldn't describe, and made him flustered 
althemore when Ryoko would phase right in front of
him when he was trying to change, making for very
embarrassing situations when she could see his...
*excitement* at the lingering dreams.  Add to that 
more embarrassment as Ayeka came to wake him for 
breakfast.  More and more he had started to doubt 
himself, and would have actively accused Ryoko, 
but how do you explain that you think someone is 
sleeping *in* your bed, *with* you?  He didn't have 
any proof.  He also liked to keep his house the 
way it was--currently intact.

     So, he had done what any red-blooded earthling
would do, and *waited* for her.  Now, he was doing
what only Tenchi would do and falling fast asleep
with the oddest mixture of mortal fear, slight
arousal (considering he was nearly asleep), and 
and a sort of security.  Tenchi felt in a drozing 
paranoid way...content.

     Ryoko did not seem to wake when Tenchi murmured
something in his sleep, something that sounded much
like her name.  But somewhere in her dreams...
"Tenchi, you damn fool!  You sleep as hard as a 
rock."  

     And soon it was morning, and she awoke
on time.  But sometimes, at night, they both 
could dream.

<Author's Notes:  As always, I hope that this makes 
just the slightest bit of sense, since I wrote it in
all one shot and I'm falling asleep (LoL!).  I think
perhaps this could be a prelude or prologue to my
spam ficlet poem called "He Smiled at Her".  I think
it fits well enough.  This shows more of Tenchi's 
curiousity in the face of danger and sometimes 
stupidity that we first saw him as having in episode
1 of the OVA.  No harm comes of it, amazingly, as he
feigns innocence like quite the clueless expert.  A
little like Mihoshi, except that he knows *exactly*
what's going on.  This focused on circumstance, and
a realization that Tenchi *does* secretly desire
physical closeness like anybody else.  He even took
advantage of the situation in a benign, almost
imaginary sort of way.  He'll never admit it, though, 
and the feeling is new to him. Sure, he might be 
thinking of sex, but he's a level-headed guy.
