Tantei A And The Bunny
---------------------------

The peaceful stillness of the Japanese countryside was broken by
a scream of surprised anger. A few animals darted their heads
this way and that in surprise. Some, sensing the arrival of some
strange new arrival, fled to the safety of their homes.

The being who had screamed stuck his muzzle out of the pile of
leaves he had fallen into and shook it. He darted his head this
way and that and tilted it quizzically. 

A mother rabbit, who wasn't sure what to make of this funny new
arrival, went over to him. It sniffed him curiously and nudged
his muzzle.

The being laughed, briefly, then simply slumped forward and
started to cry.

The rabbit hopped onto the creature's leg, causing the creature
to cry out in pain. When the creature stopped, the rabbit hopped
back and hopped onto his leg again. Same results.

Realizing the creature was hurt, the rabbit grabbed him by the
collar and tried to drag him home with her.

When that didn't work, she resolved to bring him food every day
until he was better.

Finally, he was well again. His leg had mended and he was able to
leave.  He was  a few yards away when he heard a hunter
approaching. 

"Delicious rabbit meat at two o'clock." The hunter announced as
he spotted the owner of the meat in question nibbling on some
wild vegetation.


Remembering the kindness shown to him, the alien slipped 
up behind the hunter without the slightest sound, and put his gun
to the man's head.

"Pissed off bat with a gun at six o'clock." he whispered.

The hunter ran off.
