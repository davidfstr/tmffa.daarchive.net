Sasami-chan

     A strange girl with dark brown hair sat in the parlor on her white
ghost ship and thought, holding a framed picture in her hands.
     My name is Mirei. I'm sure of that, though not much else. It doesn't
feel like I've ever been sure of anything, besides the fact that I'm
see-through and can do strange things like walk through mirrors. The girl in
the picture is me, and now you smile in the picture beside me, assuring me
that I have a friend. Ryo-ohki meows on my lap now in the picture as well.
     Never knew why I was so strange, why I frightened people. Do you know
how much it hurts to see people scream at the sight of you, Sasami-chan? I
do. You were the first person to ever smile and laugh and play with me. Play
my silly games with me and let me see what your home is like. Jurai's
beautiful.
     I remember...I remember seeing a merry-go-round in your mind, stamped
with the 'Two Thumbs Up' sticker and covered in sparkling hearts. That image
makes me feel warm and happy like I rarely ever feel.
     Yes, your friends were fun to play tricks on. Running around in sheets
and walking through the mirrors. You led me into the maze in the Jurain
royal garden, and we sat and splashed each other on the edge of the fountain
in its center. Soaking wet, we ran together, watching the fireworks and
playing on the roller coaster and the merry-go-round.
     Just a little girl. All I'll ever be, I guess.
     A tear trickled down her cheek.
     Maybe you'll be back someday, Sasami-chan. Someday. Then we can play
again, maybe dress-up, maybe on Jurai again.
     Maybe someday.
