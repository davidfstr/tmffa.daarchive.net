          A blond girl was walking down a dirt path in the jungle.she
was in the rural part of japan,and was hoping to find somebody who was
modern enough to speak english.*she only knows a bit of japanese*as soon
as she turned the corner,she saw a rabbit."mrow!"it said.surprised as
she was,she went over to it and patted it."how cute!a bunny that
meows!"she said as she picked it up.petting it.she started to walk
again.she stopped,astonished by the sight.she had found a house!

           she went up to the door and knocked.the door opened and she
saw a totaly cute guy standing there."uh...eigo ohanishi masuka?"she
struggled as she said the words."um,yeah.who are you?"he asked.wow,what
a cute voice,she thought."i was just wondering...do you have the sword

girl was standing there."you look familiar,do i know you?ayeaka!come

sternfully."devil child!great to see you again!"the blond said
