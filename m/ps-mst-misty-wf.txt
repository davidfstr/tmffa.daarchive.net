An MST by Steve

Email: psychosteve999@yahoo.com

All the characters depicted in this story are of my own creation with
the
following exceptions:

      Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Psychotic killer created by the one
and only Jhonen Vasquez.
      Crow T. Robot: That lovable golden robot from the "MST3K" TV show.

These are my original Characters:

 Sharrin Bowman: An oppressed fifteen-year-old goth/skater female
featured in a book I wrote entitled "Frogs 2: Toads".
 Psycho Steve: Pretty much a self insertion into the story.  Psycho
Steve is one of the nicknames I am known under.  Others include Evil
Steve,Whisper, and White Steve.
 Till: A seven-foot-tall German Dragon named after Rammstein's
vocalist.  This Character is featured in a sort of Quentin Tarintino
meets Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy my step-brother Andy and I came up
with.
 Nastica: Till's girlfriend who appears in the third installment of the
trilogy. Originally a dragon as well (a Russian one for a particualr
reason) was later transformed into an American 100% human goth chick.
Hey, I have a fetish for gothic girls, sue me.

These six brave souls have been forced to view really bad fanfics by
satanic stringbeans that came out of hell after Till agreed to sell his
soul to them for a gallon of vodka.  Afterwards realizing what a stupid
thing he had done Till would not give the stringbeans his soul.  The
stringbeans made a compromise, however.  If he and his friends viewed
one bad fanfic a day they would not torture and kill all of them.  The
stringbeans have set up a movie theater inside the dwelling of the six
unfortunate souls.  Only fanfics can be viewed in this theater,
however.  A certain time every day they will all be forced into the
theater to view the fic of the day.  Resistance to comply will result in
immediate death.  So begins the MST.

Everyone sits in the living room staring blankly into nothing.
STEVE: Johnny...
JOHNNY: Yeah?
STEVE: I've always been wondering...why haven't you killed any of us?
You kill almost everyone who comes in contact with you.
JOHNNY: (thinking to himself) ...I really can't say. I guess I just
never felt the urge to amongst any of you. Possibly because you aren't
all patetic drones of modern day society who doesn't understand a damn
thing I try to explain to them.
SHARRIN: I guess I can see your point there.
JOHNNY: I'm just so far away from that thing behind the blood coated
wall of my house that it's control over me is weakened. I still have
some urges left over, so that proves that it did not have complete
control over me.
CROW: Neat.
SATANIC STRINGBEAN: (speaks from TV that suddenly turns on) Attention.
TILL: (picks up remote) Ah, I hate this fuckin' show.
Till clicks the TV off. The TV quickly flips back on.
SATANIC STRINGBEAN: Hey smartass!
The crew giggles at the stringbean's discontent.
SATANIC STRINGBEAN: You are all to report to the theater now for today's
fanfic entitled "My Love for Tenchi"...GO!!

 Misty Waterflower

<STEVE: Hey, my friend's name is Misty.>
<TILL: (to Steve) My friend's name is Rotor, what's your point?>
<STEVE: (to Till) Your fucking mother, that's the point.>

                     sasami_misty@hotmail.com
                My love for Tenchi (from Sasami's point of view)

<JOHNNY: So this is going to be a first person shooter type of story?
Like how Doom is from the marine's point of view?>

lemon

<CROW: Orange.>
<TILL: Grapefruit.>
<STEVE: Plum.>
<SHARRIN: Bananna.>
<JOHNNY: Cherry.>
<NASTICA: Peach.>

        Sasami confesses to Tenchi that she loves him

<CROW: ...the end, let's leave.>

i don't own Tenchi Muyo and Sasami is 14 years old

<STEVE: ...No she's not.>

and Tenchi is 17.

<STEVE: I'm not quite sure about that one, though.>

                       My love for Tenchi

<CROW: ...goes as deep as a kiddie pool.>

It all started when i got up to make breakfast in the Masaki house.

<JOHNNY: (as sasami) I was making rat poison omlets.>

As i shut
my door

<STEVE: (singing) I want it painted black...>

I was glad Tenchi had built me my own room,

<TILL: He built it for her? How the hell did he manage to construct a
room from scratch in a house?>
<STEVE: Damned if I know.>

so i didn't wake
My sister Aeka,or Ryoko, Washu,Mihoshi,Kiyone.

<NASTICA: You could have simply said "everyone else" instead of naming
them each individually.>

So then I passed Tenchi's room
and I notised it was open

<CROW: His room was open? DOes that mean there was a hole in the wall,
or something?>
<STEVE: (to Crow) Silence.>
<CROW: Sure.>

so I went in to cheak that Ryoko wasn't hurting
him,

<SHARRIN: Does Ryoko hurt Tenchi often or something?>

I gave a sigh of relif to see Tench asleep in his bed.I left so I could
start on breakfast,after I got breakfast started i quietly creeped it
his
room.

<TILL: Wow, what a stupid sentence.>

Tenchi was still asleep,i went in and my heart started to pound,i loved
Tenchi ever since I met him but i don't chase after him because it's
useless
to force some one to love you,i kneeled at his bed side and i picked up
his
hand and placed it agenst my cheek.

<SHARRIN: Holy SHIT that was a mouthful of a sentence.>

i got up and cleaned his room and when i
was done i kissed him on the fore-head,then left.

<CROW: (as Sasami) I'm such the character, aren't I?>

It was about 9:00am when

<STEVE: (as Sasami) "Mystery Science Theater 3000" came on...>

everyone came to the table to eat as they did i got out more plates for
more
helpings then i heared

<JOHNNY: Please tell me that didn't just say "heared".>
<SHARRIN: (to Johnny) Yup, it did.>
<JOHNNY: Oh my God.>

Tenchi say

<SHARRIN: (as Sasami) I talk like caveman, he say.>

"Last night I had a weired dream that
Sasami kissed me", <CRASH> I dropped some plates,how did he know that i

<JOHNNY: PUNCTUATE YOUR GODDAMN SENTENCES CORRECTLY, YOU ASS BAG!>

kissed him so i was picking up the broken plates when it sliped

<STEVE: Okay, "it" as in what?>

and cut me
it was a deep cut but i wraped it in a cloth so i could finish up. Later
on
that day it was 4:00pm

<STEVE: It was?! No! I don't believe it!>
<EVERYONE ELSE: (to Steve) Shut up.>

 went in to Tenchi's room to get something for him
and i looked at one of his manga books and read it it was

<CROW: A violent porn comic.>

"star wars" and at
a part two people kissed after the girl called him a scoundrell.

<TILL: ...which has what to do with anything? We all know how the movie
goes you don't need to explain it to us during the middle of a story.>

 so i tooked
it for later.

<SHARRIN: "Tooked"?>
<CROW: Will somebody please send this author back to third grade?!>

That night i had a nightmare

<NASTICA: (as Sasami) Which is a good Magic the Gathering creature...>

"i saw tenchi and ryo-oh-ki get
murdered and everyone blamed me,

<JOHNNY: If anyone's gonna kill that damned little cabbit it's gonna be
me.>
<STEVE: Hells no, I'm gonna do it.>
<SHARRIN: Not if I get to it first.>

stop please i didn't do it.OH THEN WHY DO
YOU HAVE BLOOD STAINS ALL OVER YOU.no i don't  have blood on me what is
this
,no let me go AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

<STEVE: Did anybody catch what the hell that was?>
<JOHNNY: Sorta.>
<TILL: It was stupid, horribly puntuated, and had grammatical errors up
the ass, but that's about all I got.>

Ah i felt so scared so i went down
stares

<NASTICA: Wrong form of the word "stairs", cum dumpster.>

to see if every one was ok . i looked in tenchi's room and he wasn't
there so i went in to his bed and cryed

<STEVE: (as Sasami) I cried because I was too lazy to go look for him
anywhere else.>

then all of a sudden i heard Tenchi
whisper

<CROW: (as Tenchi) Punctuate your sentences in a manner that's
understandable.>

"sasami whats wrong why are you crying"?"Oh i'm sorry lord

<STEVE: ..Of the Pit...>

Tenchi i
didn't mean to wake you up,i was going to leave when Tenchi wanted to
know
what happed as i told him I saw the consern in his loving eyes.

<SHARRIN: This is getting way too incomprehensible for me to tolerate.>

when i had
finished i asked"tenchi let me stay with you please","ok sasami he
said.He
led me to his bed and as i got in he wraped his arms a round me and we
fell
asleep.Unkowned to us Ryoko decited

<CROW: Yeah, she is pretty deceitful, even though I'm pretty sure that's
not what the author wanted to say.>

to do some thing  with tenchi but she
saw me in his bed his arms wraped around me and she screamed "AEKA

<NASTICA: (as Ryoko) The 'Y' fell out of your name! We have to find it!>

EVERYONE
GET DOWN HERE" That woke every one up but not me or Tenchi.

<NASTICA: Okay, everyone hears Ryoko scream from closed doors and
elsewhere in the house, but Tenchi and Sasami, who are slleping not to
far from Ryoko, don't hear her at all. Yeah, sure.>

Then as we slept
Aeka grabed Tenchi and screamed"HOW DARE YOU FUCK MY LITTLE SISTER YOU
BASTERED"

<STEVE: But if Sasami is telling the story how does she know what's
going on around her while she is sleeping?>

I woke up when Ryoko was about to hit him so i jumped and took the
blow.

<SHARRIN: (as Ryoko) Hey! Gimme back my blow!>

"Sasami what did he do to you,cause i'll take care of him'" said
Ryoko,Aeka,Washu,and Mihoshi.

<CROW: Whoa, it looks like they all spoke in unison or something.>

"STOP LEAVE TENCHI ALONE HE DIDN'T DO ANY
THING TO ME I GOT SCARED AND I ASKED IF I COULD STAY WITH HIM SO STOP
IT" I
screamed "Sasami you don't understand that he couldn't love you" said
washu

<NASTICA: How did Washu find out about Sasami's Tenchi thingie?.>

"No you don't understand that even if he didn't care about us then i
still
would l..l..lo..v..e him.i said ,"You what"said Aeka,"I said i love
Tenchi
Masaki as much as you did maybe even more!Right there i broke into tears
and
ran to my room and locked the
door.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<SHARRIN: (as Sasami) ...And made a line of little squiggly things.>

after two days in my room i went out of my room to

<TILL: Rehydrate herself, hopefully. Two days without fluid is almost
enough to kill someone, especially a little girl.>

take a bath when i ran
into Tench i tryed to run but Tenchi held me.

<CROW: (as Sasami) Help! Rape!>

Please let me go I said
"Sasami i need to talk to you"

<STEVE: (as Tenchi) Did you steal my Star Wars comics?>

so we went in his room and he locked
the door,I moved to his bed and he got down one knee and took out a
black
box and said "Princess Sasami of Juri will you Marry me"

<ALL: HUH?!>

I welled up in
tears and said

<TILL: (as Sasami) NO! Oh my God, I'm fucking eight years old!>

"Yes..yes i'll marry you Tenchi"I said and I huged him then
we kissed,I let his tounge go in my mouth and explore,

<JOHNNY: Maybe his tongue will find Jimmmy Hoffa in there.>
<SHARRIN: (to Johnny) Huh?>
<JOHNNY: (to Sharrin) Explore. Get it?>
<SHARRIN: Oh.>

while he held
me.

<CROW: I'm beginning to have a few conceptions of where this is going.
And I don't really like them that much.>

Thenhe started to take of the light blue tank top I was wearing and un
lack

<STEVE: "Unlack", what the shit?>

the front of my size c-cup bra

<ALL: (laughing)>
<NASTICA: Yeah, I'm sure.>
<TILL: Must've gotten breast implants.>

<big for my age huh?> we broke the kiss

<CROW: (as Sasami) And then we had to fix it.>

as he lowered his head down to my breast

<STEVE: Which one?>

he took hold of one and kneded it
and took the other in to his mouth,i gave a low moan in that it felt so
wonderful,"Lord Tenchi"I said,He looked up from his work on me and
said"yes
my darling","Tenchi please violate my innosent skin make me want you
more
then I do now make ME pleasure you,for now I'm yours to play with,to toy

with to

<ALL: SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!>

do what ever you desire my love"He gave me another sweet kiss,he
tasted like a sweet drink that you crave.

<SHARRIN: So it tasted like liquor? Hell, I'm there.>

Then he layed me down and undid mt

<CROW: Fuji.>

blue-jean shorts and tossed them aside with my bra and top.He gased

<ALL: AAAH!>
<NASTICA: He gased? Damn, talk about a turn off...>

at my
panties they were  white with no frills but had a latch to open them.as
he
opened them he kissed my area

<STEVE: I've noticed that a lot of these stupid lemons use the word
"area" when referring to a woman's snatch. I just want to ask why.>
<JOHNNY: Becasue the authors are all stupid and need to be dead.>

 until i came,"what a naughty girl I'll have to
clean you up" said Tenchi"oh yes please tenchi"i said.Tenchi began to
lick
my pussy"OOOHHH TENCHI"I moaned he opened me up

<CROW: Zip!>

 and looked in me to find my
treasures that i said were now his for the taking.

<TILL: Do I even need to point out how stupid that sounds?>
<NASTICA: Black beard hid his treasure in there I bet...>

As he continued to lick me
i was coming ever closer to cumming

<NASTICA: Coming closer to cumming? That's a strange sentence.>
<TILL: And didn't she just cum a few seconds ago?>

then he licked my jewel

<CROW: "Jewel"? Did I miss something?>

and thats all it
took,"TENCHI!!!!" I screamed he opened his mouth wide so he wouldn't
miss a
drop.

<SHARRIN: Wait a minute, wait a minute, back up. What the fuck is going
on?!>

"oh God tenchi",i whispered.I tryed to get up but Tenchi said"Sasami
let me do it"

<STEVE: Huh? Do what?! What the hell is going on?!>

he let me watch him undress.

<SHARRIN: Oh, I just figured he was going to tell her to turn her head
while he undressed.>

I watched wide eyed as i saw his
bare cheast.

<NASTICA: (very unenthusiastic tone) Wopee...>

It was covered with muscles from his hard work and training with
Yosho.

<CROW: No it wasn't.>

Then i saw what all of the girls in the house would die to see I gazed
at his huge dick.

<CROW: Not they wouldn't.>

As soon as i saw it i pulled it to my mouth  and i sucked
it,licked itand made Tenchi grip the bed in pleasure."Oh Sasami your so
uuhh" It didn't take him long to cum.

<TILL: Damn, he beat my record. By A LOT.>

"SASAMI"Tenchi screamed I opened my
mouth to drink him,

<JOHNNY: Tenchi apparently liquified himself.>
<STEVE: He's T-1000!>

man his cum was soo good but it was salty.

<CROW: Thank you, and do we care?>

After Tenchi
was up again he Kissed me and tasted him self I too had tasted myself on
him

<NASTICA: Huh? Did anyone get that?>
<JOHNNY: Nope.>
<CROW: Sorry.>

I had no clue i tasted like cotten candie.

<SHARRIN: Then how did you know if you didn't know?>

He pined me on his bed and placed
a rubber on his dick that was between my pussy lips and said "Sasami Do
yo
want me to have intercorce with you"?

<ALL: (laughing hysterically)
<SHARRIN: Oh my God, that was almost as funny as Ayeka's line in
"Euphoria".>
<CROW: I mean seriously, who says it like THAT?>

I said yes but be gentel it's my first
time".It's also mine said  Tenchi as he pushed it in i felt my virginity

being riped inside.

<NASTICA: Yeah, that description is stupid, but whatever.>

I didn't scream but i shed a tear.

<STEVE: ...the hell's your point?>

Tenchi i guess saw it
and licked it and said "now there will only be joy", and he pushed it
slowly
and then went faster and faster."Oh sasami yes" said tenchi I let out a
moan
of pleasure as he kept on fucking me it felt so good after awhile a new
feeling

<TILL: Okay, okay, I've gotta call this one. There should have been two
periods among that mass of words preceeding this.>
<JOHNNY: Was teh author born without a brain stem or something?>

was building up i needed tenchi to go harder and deeper for some
reason.

<CROW: Yeah, some reason...>

OH tenchi do it harder please", he did it was so good he made me moan
for him and want him to be with me forever.But then I cummed

<STEVE: That's like the thrid time in ten minutes that she's cummed,
something's not right.>

and
hard"TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIII"!

<SHARRIN: KAAAAAAMEEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAMEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAA!>

as
i screamed he still pumped himself never stoping then he came in me as i

orgasumed again with him"SSSSAAAASSSSAAAAMMMMIIII","TTTEEENNNCCCHHHIII!

<SHARRIN: Okay, no one else in the house hears any of this?>

Tenchi climbed off me
and said "sasami your the best thats why your my fiannc`e" then he
kissed
me. After 4 hours of sleep and a shower together we got dressed and told

them

<STEVE: Them as in the giant ants from that movie, I guess.>

"WE'RE GETTING MARRIED" Then Ryoko and Aeka began to cry in defete and i

Told them  it was ok  but they would live with it then as we were
celebratin
the house began to rummble and a tracter beam surrond me and we saw
Kagato

<CROW: This is a little too random for me.>

in all his Evil glory staring at me and the last thing I remember was
Tenchi

KAGATO
