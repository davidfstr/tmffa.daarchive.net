HMS ROWSDOWER

A PLAY IN THREE ACTS

BY CYRUS MARRINER

BASED ON MUSIC BY GILBERT AND SULLIVAN, AND VARIOUS LENGTHLY MONOLOGUES 
BY A DEAD BRITISH GUY NAMED SHAKESPEARE.

Act I: In Which the HMS Zap Rowsdower Decides to Do a Musical for a 
Season Finale

<SCENE:  The lounge of the HMS Zap Rowsdower.  CYRUS is seated in the 
recliner, making notes on his clipboard, while DUO is lying across the 
couch, holding a Dreamcast controller and staring at the TV slack-
jawed.  KEN is sitting down leaning up against the couch, holding the 
other Dreamcast controller.>

CYRUS: Hmmm...well, according to this, we've completed a season of 
     MSTing!

DUO: It took you this long to figure that out?  I mean, for chrissakes, 
     the last three episodes have been part of a Special Season finale 
     event.  Jesus.

KEN: Shut up and pay attention, Duo.  You're losing.  At Tech Romancer.  
     How does a Gundam pilot lose at Mecha Game?

DUO: He loses when he's fucking sick of playing the same three 
     Dreamcast games over and over again.  Shit, can't we get a 
     Gamecube here?  Or an X-Box?

CYRUS: An X-Box?  For christ's sake, why don't you just ask me to bring 
     a damn gun on board and shoot myself?

DUO: Halo is fun!

CYRUS: What sort of loser are you?  Go to hell, and take your giant 
     X-Box with you.

KEN: Maybe Kagato can get us a new gaming system.  Or at least a copy 
     of Shenmue.

CYRUS: Yes, that's a good idea!  Let's go ask Kagato.  Everyone, to the 
     bridge!

	[CYRUS leaps out of his chair and runs to the lift.  
	DUO and KEN exchange glances, shrug, and drop their 
	Dreamcast controllers, following with much less 
	enthusiasm.]

<SCENE: The Bridge of the HMS Zap Rowsdower.  WORMON is wearing a tiny 
smoking jacket and holding a pipe.  KIYONE is sitting in the captain's 
chair.  Her hair is slightly disheveled, a few of her shirt buttons are 
open, and she's not wearing pants.>

KIYONE: This can't go on, you know.  We are too different, you and I.

WORMON: What do you mean?

KIYONE: Isn't it obvious?  I'm a human, you're a...um, caterpillar.  
     I'm white, you're...green.  I'm from space, you're from, er...a 
     computer.  I have genitalia, you...well, I don't even know how I 
     have sex with you.

WORMON: Yes, that's true, on one hand.  But on the other hand, isn't it 
     the best damn sex you've ever had?

KIYONE: Well, yes.  I still don't know how...

WORMON: 'Tis but thy species that is my enemy; 
     Thou art yourself, not some sort of pasty fleshbeing. 
     What is human?  It is neither hand nor foot, 
     Nor mandible, nor feeler, nor any other part 
     Belonging to a person or worm-like creature!  
     O, be some other species! What's in a species?  
     That which we call a rose by any other  
     Genetic structure would smell as sweet  
     Unless it were engineered to be odorous? 
     So Wormon would, were he not a worm! 
     Retain that dear sexaliciousness which he owes 
     Without that species. Wormon, doff thy species, 
     And for that species which is no part of thee 
     Digivolve to Stingmon!

	[There is a bright flash of light, and an annoying
	transformation sequence.  When the glow dies down,
	WORMON is no longer the small, weak caterpillar-like
	creature he was before.  He is now a large, winged,
	humanoid with insect-like features, STINGMON.]

STINGMON: Is this better?

KIYONE: Well, um, you're more like a human, but you're still a 
different species.

STINGMON: Weren't you bitching about me not having any external 
genitalia?

KIYONE: Well, yes, but...

STINGMON: Well, check this out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.

	[STINGMON reaches towards the chitinous armor at 
	his crotch, but before he can do anything, CYRUS, 
	DUO, and KEN enter from the elevator.]

CYRUS: ...so anyway, that's why it took me so long to figure out we had 
     just finished a season.

DUO: Oh, that makes sense.

KEN: [nods] Yes, it certainly does.  After hearing that, I no longer 
     think that was an idiotic thing to say, and you only said it to 
     break the silence and get us to go to the bridge.

DUO: Abso--[turns and sees STINGMON]--LY SHIT!  WHAT IS THAT?

CYRUS: Aliens have invaded the ship!  Grab the plasma rifles and 
     crossbows!

KEN: No.  It's just Wormon, but he digivolved.  Call him Stingmon.

DUO: "Digivolve"?  What sort of stupid shit is that?  I swear, they 
     could have called it something less gay.  Like "evolve" or 
     "fuck up the ass".

STINGMON: Thank you so much for your assessment.  So, what brings you 
     fellows here?  [aside]  They interrupted what was about to be some
     Earth-shattering sex!

KIYONE: What was that?

STINGMON: You heard that?  But how?

KIYONE: You just whispered it away from us.  And not that quietly.

STINGMON: But it was an aside!  You guys can't hear an aside!

DUO: I heard it.

KEN: Me too.

CYRUS: Yup.

STINGMON: Well shit.  Um, anyway, why are you guys here?

DUO: Well, it wasn't to see Kiyone with the top two shirt buttons open, 
     although it's certainly a welcome sight nonetheless.

KIYONE: [looks down] SHIT!

	[KIYONE grabs her shirt closed and runs out, grabbing
	a pair of pants that had been thrown over the top of 
	a chair near the exit as she leaves.]

DUO: Thank you God, for that which you have given me.

CYRUS: Anyway, yeah, we want to talk to Kagato.  Think you can patch us 
     through, Wormon?

STINGMON: It's Stingmon.

CYRUS: Fine.  Stingmon, can you get us talking to Kagato?

STINGMON: Sure.

	[STINGMON presses a few buttons on the console. 
	Moments later, KAGATO appears on the main viewscreen.]

KAGATO: What is it now?

KEN: Well, um, we were hoping you might have a way to give us a--

	[DUO leaps in front of KEN, interrupting him.]

DUO: --X-Box!

	[CYRUS tackles DUO out of the way.]

CYRUS: Ignore him.  We want a Gamecube.  And Super Smash Brother Melee.

KAGATO: Ah, I see.  Well, you see, I can do that.

CYRUS: YES!

KAGATO: But, I will need you to do something for me.

CYRUS:  What?

KAGATO: I require you to put on a musical.

CYRUS:  WHAT?  Why?

KAGATO: Well, you see...[KAGATO clears his throat]

[Sung to "I am the Very Model of a Modern Major General" from Pirates of 
Penzance]

	Ohhhh...
	I am the very model of a modern major enemy
	I've information crossover, spam, regular, and lemony
	I've read through Phucknut, Tank Cop, even Alienboy Fifty-Two
	And still I cannot find a fic that will cause Ken to go cuckoo

	I am very well acquainted too with fics that lack in quality
	I've read through several billion in which Ryoko gets Te-hen-chi
	About Ayeka's evil I am teeming with a lot of news

DUO: Shit, nothing rhymes with "lot of news" besides "hypotenuse".  
     Kags is screwed.

	[KAGATO glares at DUO, then resumes singing.]

	About the many methods Clayton Overstreet forced her to use!

CYRUS: Ha.  Where's my twenty, Duo?

	I am very good at stomaching garbage that's out of character
	I've even seen those fics where someone breaks Sasami's "barrier"
	In short in matters crossover, spam, regular, and lemony
	I am the very model of a modern major enemy!

	I've learned many things while reading lemons than I'd care to know
	Like how women spray semen and places my penis should not go
	I've seen Tenchi get crossed over with things of which no one has heard.
	Like Ultima Trev's stupid shit or Super Defense Hummingbird.

	I've read all of those fics by that sick guy named Mister Sinister
	I know little about him but I know he is a lo-ho-ser
	He wants to nail Sasami but at least he makes her grow up first

CYRUS: As if that's any consolation.

	But then he goes and fucks her in the orifice that is the worst.

DUO: God, don't make me remember that.

	It seems there is no end to goddamn crossovers with Dragonball 
	And there are even Pokemon ones where I go "Retch at 'em all"
	In short in matters crossover, spam, regular, and lemony
	I am the very model of a modern major enemy!

	In fact when I know what is meant by "torturing" and "pillaging"
	When I can kill an innocent and burn down a whole galaxy
	When toying with my foes and hurting their loved ones I'm better at
	And when I know precisely how to kill cabbits with a carrot

	When I know the progress that's been made in modern mad science
	When I know more of evil than a little man whose name's Clarence
	In short, when I've a smattering of elemental evilness,
	
DUO: Alright, he's on "evilness".  You can't tell me he's not fucked now.

	This line doesn't rhyme and if you point it out I'll kill you.  In the 
face.

CYRUS: Ouch.  Burned.

	Though horrible violent acts of bad are obviously not for me
	Hell I only try them once or twice in every other century
	But still in matters crossover, spam, regular, and lemony
	I am the very model of the modern major enemy!

KAGATO: So, you see, you should sing, or else I'll kill you.

CYRUS: Makes sense.

END ACT I

ACT II: In Which Cyrus Comes Dangerously Close to Writing Child Pornography

<SCENE: KEN and MISATO are lying in bed.  Together.  Unclothed.  MISATO's 
head is resting on KEN's chest, and he has his arm around her.>

KEN: How did this happen?

MISATO: How did what happen?

KEN: This.  Us.  How'd we end up together?

MISATO: I think it had something to do with both of us being young and 
     horny, and my only options besides you were Duo and Cyrus.

KEN: That could do it.

	[KEN looks around the bedroom and sighs.]

KEN: What are we doing?  Do we have any sort of a future together?  Or is 
     this just a relationship of necessity?

MISATO: I don't know.  It started out of necessity...but now, I don't 
     know.  I think I love you, Ken.

KEN: I love you too, Misato.

MISATO: Care to go again, dear?

KEN: [grins] Of course.

	[MISATO rolls on top of KEN, but before anything can
	start, DUO enters the room.]

DUO: HOOOOOOLY SHIT!

	[MISATO turns around, gasps, and grabs the blanket 
	around herself.  Unfortunately for KEN, this leaves 
	him very exposed, and he runs off in the bathroom.
	As soon as he exits, CYRUS enters after hearing DUO's
	cry.]

CYRUS:

[Sung to "He Is an Englishman" from HMS Pinafore]

	Pretty crewmate of mine
	I insist upon knowing
	What you may be doing
	With this underaged guy.

	For this excellent teen,
	Though he's much smarter than me
	I don't know how you can be
	having sex legally.

DUO:
	Now listen to him here,
	For he's much smarter than me
	And can't know how you can be
	Fucking this queer.

	[KEN returns and punches DUO in the stomach.]

KEN:
	Now stupidass I am not gay
	I'm merely intellectual, not queer
	And if I was gay would I spend all day
	Having hot sex with Misato here?

CYRUS:
	Oh horror!

MISATO:						KEN:

He's arrogant, psychotic and smart		I'm talented, well-endowed and smart
But still twice as good in bed as you		And don't forget I am good in bed.
He's got a nice ass and a noble heart		I've got a nice ass and noble heart
Except when he tries to murder Du...o		But sometimes I try to murder Du...o
He's dared to try to touch my tits		I've dared to try to touch her tits
And because I need a lay he did			And because she is a slut I did
But now I've come to love his wit		But now she's come to love my wit
And his Rowsdowrian humor!			And my Rowsdowrian humor!

DUO and CYRUS:
	He is Rowsdowrian?

	[WORMON descends from an air vent, singing]

WORMON:
	He is Rowsdowrian!
	For he himself hangs out here
	And he watches MSTs and jeers
	For he is Rowsdowrian!

CYRUS, DUO, and WORMON:
	For he is Rowsdowrian!

WORMON:
	He might have worked for Tay-ay-lor
	Suzuki or Bryan We-eh-ber
	Or perhaps for Glyph Bellchime!

CYRUS: Her and Weber are getting married, you know.

DUO: I heard.  Congratulations to them.

WORMON: Aren't we supposed to be singing?

CYRUS: Oh, right.

WORMON:
	But in spite of all the cruisers
	Where there are not all these losers
	He remains Rowsdowrian!

CYRUS, DUO, and WORMON:
	He remains Rows-ows-ows-dow-ow-ow-ow-ow-OW! OW! OW!

	[MISATO is hitting them all with a wiffle bat.]

MISATO: GET OUT OF HERE!  I WANT TO GET DRESSED! 

CYRUS, DUO, and WORMON:
	But he is Rows-ows-ows-dow-ow-SHIT!

	[MISATO fires the sidearm in her jacket at them.]

MISATO: STOP SINGING AND LEAVE!

	[CYRUS, DUO, and WORMON exit, hastily.]

<SCENE: CYRUS, DUO, and WORMON are relaxing in the lounge.  CYRUS is in 
the recliner, and DUO is lying splayed upon the couch.  WORMON is 
sitting on the back of the chair, looking depressed.  But he always 
looks like that.>

	[DUO sighs.]

DUO: This isn't going to work.  Singing is too hard.  Especially in 
     text.

CYRUS: We can't give up now!  We only have one act left!

DUO: Yeah, but we need to come up with at least three songs.

CYRUS: We already have two!

WORMON: No, we don't.  We have to come up with three songs of our own, 
     and Kagato's song doesn't count.

DUO: Why are we doing this?

CYRUS: For a Gamecube, of course!

DUO: No, I was being deeper.  Why are we MSTing?

CYRUS: Oh, that's simple.  You see...

	[Sung to the tune "A More Humane Mikado" from The Mikado]

	A more insane MST Captain never did in space exist
	And nobody else
	Has read through the hells
	Of a Gene Mesaki MST!

	It is my very insane endeavour
	To MST some awful fics
	To take the writer
	And start a fire
	To roast their stuff for kicks!

	My object so sublime
	I shall achieve in time--
	To openly mock those fics that suck
	Mock those fics that suck!
	
	And in each goddamn MST
	We will get really pissed
	Then raise our hand and shake our fists
	Raise and shake our fists!

	The stupid foolish fetish writers
	Who give their girls dicks
	We call them queers
	And laugh and sneer
	'bout how they live their fics

	The amateur author who's written villainies
	None would wish to see
	Will often be mocked
	For his tiny cock
	And awful analogies

	The writer who fails to watch the series
	Before writing stories
	His skills are lambasted
	His lineage blasted
	For gross inaccuracies.

	The idiot who sits down for a moment
	And writes a 10K fic
	He didn't spellcheck
	His fic is a wreck
	And he's a stupid prick

	My object so sublime
	I shall achieve in time--
	To openly mock those fics that suck
	Mock those fics that suck!

	And in each goddamn MST
	We will get really pissed
	Then raise our hand and shake our fists
	Raise and shake our fists!

DUO and WORMON:

	His object so sublime
	He shall achieve in time--
	To openly mock those fics that suck
	Mock those fics that suck!

	And in each goddamn MST
	We will get real pissed
	Then raise our hand and shake our fists
	Raise and shake our fists!

CYRUS:
	The SI-writing quack who wearies
	With tales of perfect men
	We laugh at the fool
	For he is a tool
	And he loses although he wins

	The song-fic writer waxes poetic
	And never says a thing
	The songs are just bad
	Their crap drives us mad
	The fic reaches no ending.

	The Sasami-rape author who anyone catches
	Meets a special fate
	He burns in hell
	His body does swell
	And nev'r 'gain masturbates.

	This is the worst curse that any one author
	Who writes that shit can have
	For they'll never have sex
	But those are effects
	Of failing to take a bath

	My object so sublime
	I shall achieve in time--
	To openly mock those fics that suck
	Mock those fics that suck!

	And in each goddamn MST
	We will get really pissed
	Then raise our hand and shake our fists
	Raise and shake our fists!

DUO and WORMON:

	His object so sublime
	He shall achieve in time--
	To openly mock those fics that suck
	Mock those fics that suck!

	And in each goddamn MST
	We will get really pissed
	Then raise our hand and shake our fists
	Raise and shake our fists!

DUO: So, that's it?  Because we're full of hate?

CYRUS: Basically.

DUO: Sounds about right.

	[A door slams.  MISATO runs through the lounge, crying,
	and she enters the elevator.  A short time later, KEN
	walks into the lounge and sits down, sighing.]

CYRUS: What was that all about?

KEN: [sighs] I just broke up with her.

	[DUO smacks KEN.  Hard.]

DUO: You stupid idiot!  Not only is she hot--by which I mean HOT--but 
     we just improvised a whole song about how great you were and how 
     she should keep giving you hot sex!

KEN: I did it for her sake.  We both knew it wouldn't work.

CYRUS: Yeah, the age difference.  And the statutory rape.

KEN: It wasn't statutory rape.  I'm sixteen.

CYRUS: But you look so young.

KEN: Yeah, I know.  I think there was a screw up in your transportation 
     device, because I existed outside of time for four years.

CYRUS: You existed outside of time?  DID YOU SEE HIM?  DID YOU?

	[DUO kicks CYRUS out of the way.]

DUO: Ignore the fangirl here.  So what you're saying is that you 
     existed in a temporal void for four years?  And you didn't mention 
     anything?

KEN: It slipped my mind.  And since when did you use words like 
     "temporal void"?

CYRUS: Because that's what it said on this card I was holding up for 
     him.

	[CYRUS is holding up a 3x5 index card with DUO's lines
	written on it.]

KEN: Oh.  Well, yeah.  So, you see, I'm technically sixteen.  I just 
     look young.  And also, I'm above the legal age of consent in 
     Japan, the nation of both Misato's origin and mine.  So, our tryst 
     was perfectly legal.

CYRUS: Ah, excellent.  So that means I won't have people stabbing me in 
     my sleep for being a dirty pedophile.

END ACT II

ACT III: In Which Our Story is Concluded in a Vaguely Shakespearean Manner, 
Except Without All the Suicide

<SCENE: MISATO is sitting in the galley, relaxing with a few beers.  In the 
sense of many beers.  Cans are strewn about the floor, and it's obvious she's 
put down quite a few.>

MISATO: O, what tragic labor 'tis to have loved?
     Except for mine beer, that steadfast ally,
     The eternal comforter I imbibe,
     The mere thought of this love would defeat me!

	[KIYONE enters.]

KIYONE: I thought I heard someone butchering iambic pentameter in here.  
     What's wrong, Misato?

MISATO: Alas!  For what to be a lover spurned?
     Mine rejection harkens to those harsh fears,
     The fears betwixt which existence exists.
     Hear! My feet tread upon my heart so low.

KIYONE: Jesus.  You're the only person I know who's a Shakespearean drunk.  
     Besides Shakespeare, I guess.

	[SHAKESPEARE is sitting in the corner of the galley, 
	and throws a beer can at KIYONE.]

SHAKESPEARE: Shuteth your fuckingeth moutheth, bitcheth.

	[SHAKESPEARE exits.]

MISATO: Alas!  My Shakespeare do be improper!
     I do not have enough apostrophes!
     The Bard 'twas rul'd by that bit of grammar!
     What hath this binging wrought 'pon my fair tongue?

KIYONE: I know what it's wreaking upon my ears...

MISATO: Hark!  A message must be sent! Kagato!
     O, Kagato, can dost bring me more beer?
     For this life-filling beverage is gone,
     And I fear I may be sober 'fore bed!
     Dost thou wish upon me a hangover?
     Or perhaps my pain fuels your evil schemes?
     Nay!  It matters not, for my wom'nly needs!
     Foremost my need for alcohol!  Save me!

KIYONE: Kagato can't hear you.  And even if he could, I doubt he'd come 
     running just because a drunken woman is spouting poorly composed 
     Shakespearean verse.

	[KAGATO teleports in.]

KAGATO: I received reports of Shakespearean verse in the area.  Can I 
     be of assistance?

KIYONE: You did that just to spite me, didn't you?

KAGATO: I'm not saying.

MISATO: Alas!  Alack!  Alas!  Alarm!  Alvin!
     I am in need of that most vital drink,
     That sustaining fluid for this f'lorn life.
     Dost thou have a bit for me to keep, sir?

KAGATO: Kiyone, please translate.

KIYONE: She's out of beer.

KAGATO: Well, I'm sorry.  I don't have any, and even if I did, I would 
     not give it to you.  I could synthesize vodka, but I fear this 
     state is not one I would wish upon my subjects.

MISATO: Oh.  Well, fuck you, you puritan asshole.
     I'm getting the hell out of here.  Later.

	[MISATO stands up shakily, and stumbles out of the 
	galley.]

KAGATO: Moody bitch when she's drunk, ain't she?

KIYONE: You're telling me.

<SCENE: CYRUS's room.  MISATO is grabbing things and throwing them into 
an empty suitcase.  CYRUS is watching, along with DUO.>

CYRUS: Um, what are you doing, Misato?

MISATO: I told you, I'm leaving.

CYRUS: No, I was wondering why you're taking my things and putting them 
     into your suitcase.

MISATO: This is my room.  These are my things.

CYRUS: No, this is MY room.  These are MY things.  YOUR room is across 
     the hall.

	[MISATO mutters to herself and holds out a lacy black
	pair of panties.]

MISATO: You can have this if you shut up.

	[Before CYRUS can grab the panties, DUO leaps forward 
	and snatches it away, running off with it.]

DUO: Woohoo!

MISATO: [sighs] I should have expected something like that.

CYRUS: Well, you know what they say.

	[sung to "A British Tar is a Soaring Soul" from HMS 
	Pinafore.]

	Duo Maxwell is a sad pervert
	As horny as a twelve-year-old
	His energetic hand
	Will be wrapped around his man-
	hood and ready to jack off.

	[KIYONE enters.]

KIYONE:
	He shall lube his hand

CYRUS:
	And his palm will sweat 

KIYONE: 
	His eyes roll back

CYRUS:
	And his brow grows wet

KIYONE:
	He shall grab his cock

CYRUS:
	And his arm shall pump

CYRUS and KIYONE:
	And his mind shall produce
	Images of your nice rump.

	[A CHORUS composed of about twenty fancily dressed men
	and women enters from CYRUS's bathroom.]

CHORUS:
	He shall lube his hand and his palm will sweat 
 	His eyes roll back and his brow grows wet
	He shall grab his cock and his arm shall pump
	And his mind shall produce images of your nice rump.

	[There is a loud gunshot, and one a member of the 
	CHORUS falls over dead.  The rest of the CHORUS flees
	in terror.  MISATO blows the smoke from her pistol.]

MISATO: I am so glad I had this thing.  You two had better never again 
     sing about Duo masturbating to my underwear again.

CYRUS: Um...sorry.

	[MISATO closes the suitcase.]

MISATO: Well, you two, it's been a good ride.  But you know, I can't 
     survive on a beerless ship.  So, I guess this is goodbye.

CYRUS: Will you come visit occasionally?

MISATO: Sure.

	[MISATO goes and hugs KIYONE.]

MISATO: I'll never forget the night of passion we shared.

CYRUS: Huh?  Bwah?  Yes?  GAH?

MISATO: [whispering to KIYONE] That's for the song you just sang.

KIYONE: [whispering back] I'll miss you, you bitch.  Now, get out of 
     here.

	[MISATO walks past CYRUS, who is standing with his jaw
	agape.]

MISATO: It was fun.  I'll keep in touch

	[CYRUS recovers his senses.]

CYRUS: There's a door on the lower floor; it's marked "Employees Only".  
     That should take you home.

MISATO: Thanks.  I was about to look for a box labeled "Hamdingers".

	[MISATO kisses CYRUS on the cheek and darts out of the
	room.]

<SCENE: MISATO is walking down the hallway, looking back towards the 
room she has just left.  Not looking where she's going, she bumps into 
DUO, who is walking out of the bathroom zipping up his fly.>

DUO: Oh, sorry Misato.  You leaving already?

MISATO: Yeah.  Goodbye.

DUO: Hey, it's okay.  Mind if I do one thing before you go?

MISATO: Well, that depends on what--

	[DUO slaps MISATO's ass.  As soon as he does, MISATO
	slaps him across the face.]

MISATO: You pervert.

DUO: No, that's not perverted.  What's perverted is that I'm wearing 
     your panties.

	[MISATO looks down, her hand covering a smile.]

MISATO: I won't forget you, Duo Maxwell.  No matter how much therapy I 
     take.

	[MISATO runs off down the hall, carrying her suitcase.
	As soon as she's gone, DUO shifts uncomfortably and 
	scratches his crotch.]

DUO: Shit, these things are uncomfortable.

<SCENE: The theater.  MISATO is walking around, taking a last look at 
the place.>

MISATO: *sighs* I never thought I'd end up enjoying this quite so much.

	[WORMON hops over a seat.]

WORMON: Talk to Ken before you leave.

MISATO: You care for him, don't you?

WORMON: We've been through a lot together.

MISATO: Okay, I will.

	[MISATO picks up WORMON and snuggles him.]

MISATO: You're a sweet guy-caterpillar-thing.

WORMON: [blushing] Aww...

MISATO: And take care of Kiyone.

	[MISATO sets WORMON down on a seat and leaves.]

WORMON: I'll do my best...

<SCENE: Sub-basement 12A.  MISATO is staring at the door marked 
"Employees Only", her suitcase set on the ground at her feet.>

	[KEN enters.]

KEN: Go ahead.  It's what's best.

MISATO: Ken...

KEN: Don't worry about us.  We'll do fine without you.  We managed 
     before you came along, we'll manage now.

MISATO: What about you?

KEN: I'm fine.  I won't forget you, though.

	[MISATO opens her mouth to say something, then closes
	it.  Instead, she moves forward and kisses KEN full on
	the lips.  After a few moments, they both withdraw.]

MISATO: I won't forget you, either, Ken.  You were fantastic.

	[MISATO turns and picks up her suitcase and walks 
	through the door, closing it behind her.]

MISATO: SHIT!  It's just a fucking broom closet!

KEN: Try the switch at the back.

MISATO: Oh, thanks.

	[There is a bright flash of light from crack under
	the door.  Then, a thin haze of smoke seeps out 
	through it.]

END ACT III

EPILOGUE

<SCENE: KEN's room.  KEN is lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling.>

KEN: [sighs] Did I screw up?  Maybe it wasn't meant to be, but what if 
     it was?

	[KEN sighs again, and reaches over to pick up his
	copy of The Analects.]

KEN: Perhaps you have some answers, Confucius.

	[KEN opens the book, and an envelope labeled "Ken"
	falls out.  KEN opens the envelope and pulls out a 
	letter, reading its contents.]

MISATO: [voiceover]

Dear Ken,
	I know I probably wasn't anywhere near as eloquent or emotive as 
I should have been when I left.  So I wrote this.
	Ken, nothing lasts forever.  Our love was fantastic, but it 
wouldn't have lasted forever.  MST crews are very transitory, and it's 
extremely likely we would have been returned to our homes after six 
episodes.  But this one is still going, and I hope you stay with it.
	Really, all I have to say is "live".  Enjoy your life every day 
as the miracle it is.  People don't do that anymore, and that's 
probably what's wrong with the whole system right now.
	Enough of my prattling, though.  I love you, Ken, and I shall do 
so until the end of my days.  When we first met, it was magical, as was 
that first night.  I don't know how we managed to keep our relationship 
secret for so long, but I'm glad we did.  I'm glad we had what we did 
together, just between the two of us.  I love the rest of the crew like 
family, too, but our relationship wasn't something to be shared.  It 
was between the two of us, and I'm glad it stayed that way.
	You were right to end it, Ken.  It wouldn't have worked.
	But I still love you.
							Kisses,
							Misato Katsuragi

	[KEN folds up the letter, puts it back in the envelope,
	and puts it in his desk drawer.]

KEN: You were the best thing that ever happened to me, Misato.  I love 
     you too.


[SONG: "Blue" by Yoko Kanno]

Never seen a bluer sky  
Yeah I can feel it reaching out  
And moving closer  
There's something about blue 

Asked myself what it's all for  
You know the funny thing about it  
I couldn't answer  
No I couldn't answer

Things have turned a deeper shade of blue  
And images that might be real  
May be illusion  
Keep flashing off and on

Free  
Wanna be free  
Gonna be free  
And move among the stars  
You know they really aren't so far

Feels so free  
Gotta know free  
Please  
Don't wake me from the dream  
It's really everything it seemed

I'm so free  
No black and white in the blue

Everything is clearer now  
Life is just a dream you know  
That's never ending  
I'm ascending


*END*
