………………………………………………………………………………………………………………

        Somewhere in the vastness of the multiverse, there is a certain
focal point
of the worlds.  A place where our reality and those of our favorite comic
books meet, and are able to cross.  At this place was constructed a huge
station, technically advanced in ways that surpass even the most futuristic
of
realities.  In this place research is conducted on the fictional stories
that
are created by the ever adoring fans of the comics.  FAN-FICTIONS.  One man
from our reality, a sponsor of the station, has been given the task of
leading
the research on the stories, by bringing together the most unique group of
people from the anime realms.  The place is “AnimePort#9”.  These are the
reviews. . .

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Technical note:

Due to circumstances beyond our control, this MST will feature only the
following members.
PETER SUZUKI
B-KO DAITOKUJI.

Begin recording of research documentation.

        (Today instead of starting in the lounge, the camera opens up in the
theater.
 Instead of rows and rows of seats, only two swivel chairs sit in the middle
of the theater.  Seated in them are two shadowy figures.  From outside the
theater, something about “Gibbering knuckles” can be heard, just before the
doors close, and the theater lights turn on.  This reveals B-ko on the left
dressed up as Gene Siskel, and Peter on the right dressed up as Roger Ebert,
snacking on several assorted bags of stuff.)

B-KO(to the camera):  Greetings.  I’m B-ko Daitokuji.
PETER(swallowing soda):  And I’m Peter Suzuki, and welcome to Anime Port
nine’s “At the Fan Fics”.  Tonight we have given most of the usual MST crew
the night off, so we can do an MST of an MST.
B-KO:  For a long time now, Peter Suzuki has been credited with making the
first, and so far only, funny Sasami Lemon.  Recently, someone has MSTed
that
lemon.
PETER:  So tonight, we are going to make fun of someone making fun of me.
Let’s watch.
        (They turn towards the screen, the lights dim, and the MST
commences.)

>The Crew Of the JEDRI---

B-KO:  Which is an acronym for what?
PETER:  Maybe they spelled Jurai wrong.

B-KO:  Okay, begin the hit list.

>
>*Glyph Bellchime-The Leader, human female. "Well, excuse mee! I meant
>`guys' as in the group, OKAY?"

PETER(writing down the name):  That joke only works if you’re a male
speaking
to females.

>ship that's just a littl' bigger?"

B-KO & PETER:  No

B-KO:  Sure miss Washu.  Whatever.

PETER:  With any luck, this will be the first and last episode, because of
him.
B-KO:  Peter!
PETER:  Sorry.  Blame it on working with Priss, for so long.

>
>Pathos-The not-so-bright one, projectionist, humanoid cat. "I not sound
>like Shampoo!"

PETER:  No, but you sure talk like her.

>
>*--actual MSTers

B-KO:  So the others are just wasted space?

>
>
>Washu held the glass beaker up above her head. "Here Cypher!" Then in a
>cute voice. "Wittle Washu just wants a wittle sample."

B-KO & PETER: . . . . .
PETER(Scimitar):  I don’t like where this is going.

> She looked around for a fair-sized puddle of what looked like movable,
>gold Jell-O treats.

B-KO:  Uh . . .  Yum?

>The party in question held very still and very
>quiet.

PETER(Elmer Fudd):  Be wewy, wewy quiet.  Washu wants a wittle sample.
Wuh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.

> "If I hold still long enough, maybe she'll put me down and leave me
>alone," the jar above her head kept thinking.

B-KO:  Of course that’s what ALL pieces of her lab equipment think, from
time
to time.

> She set him down and called up her holo-computer. She started a scan.
>"Ah, very clever, Cypher," she muttered, then snapped her fingers.
>The small force field snapped around the jar. "Dammit," the jar
>internally grumbled.

PETER(jar as Snivley Whiplash):  Curses!  Foiled again!

>Then he changed his shape into a kangaroo mouse.
>"Washu would have to let up the force field to pick up me," he thought.
>"Then I can jump my way outta here!"
>But she didn't do that.

B-KO & PETER(kangaroo mouse):  D’OH!

>No, instead, she just pressed a few buttons,
>and, pop,

PETER:  goes the weasel.
B-KO:  Kangaroo mouse.
PETER(Squall):  Whatever . . .

>he found himself in a large, clear, shielded vat. "So she got
>you too, huh?"

B-KO(kangaroo mouse):  Yes anonymous voice, she got me too, huh.

>Cypher resumed his humanoid shape and look over at the vat next to him.

PETER:  Hey, you never told us that Shampoo was narrating this MST!

>In said a creature that would have given many a historian a heart
>attack.

B-KO:  “In said a creature”?  I hope the MST is better than the opening bit.

>It looked very much like a mythological griffin, but it had
>metal and technical interfaces integrated into its body.

PETER(pulling out a Pokeball):  It’s a Pokemon!
B-KO(pulling Peter back down):  It’s not a Pokemon, now sit back down!

>"What is now, four times this week, REBB?" Cypher grumbled.
>"Five. Unfortunately, I'm easier to catch," the griffin muttered, then
>added. "I am transformed." The phrase changed his form.

B-KO(Power Ranger):  IT’S MORPHING TIME!!!
PETER(Blue Beetle Borg):  Beetle Bonder!  BEETLE BLAST!!

>The large
>humanoid looking robot sat back down on the floor of the vat. "So what
>do you think she'll do to us, this time?"

PETER(Cypher):  Standard Washu lemon. (Hit by B-ko.)  *WACK!* OW!

>"Gods, I hope it's not the centrifuge again," Cypher held where his
>stomach would be if he had one. "Last time, I had been dizzy for >hours."

B-KO:  Wheeee . . .

>
>"Boy, you would be a lotta fun at an amusement park," the robot >muttered
>under his breath.
>"What did you say?"

PETER:  He said (Through megaphone) “BOY, YOU WOULD BE A LOTTA FUN AT AN
AMUSEMENT PARK,”!!!!!!!

>"If she gets near me with that probe again, I'll stick it up her waste
>disposal unit!" REBB growled aloud.

        (B-ko tries to slap REBB on the screen.)
B-KO(Ms. Swan):  No say probe!

>At this point, Washu entered, wearing her nurses uniform and carrying
>some weird alienlike devices.

PETER:  Oh, and look.  There’s the probe.
B-KO(Ms. Swan):  No say probe! (Slaps Peter.)  *SMACK!*
PETER:  OW!

>Cypher felt like sinking to the floor,
>and about did.
>Washu sounded like the wicked witch of the west, "Hello my pretties!!!"
>(Puts on a rubber glove) **KER-SNAP**
>Making both Cypher and REBB jump.

PETER:  As well as the winged monkeys, around Washu’s lab.

>"Hey Cypher, match you for it?"
>"Ok. One, two, three, Damn!"
>"Alright! It's been real nice knowing you, Cypher."
>"Best two out of three?"
> Then a voice squawked over a nearby companel.

PETER(AOL voice):  You’ve got lemon!
B-KO(Washu doing an impersonation of the AOL voice):  I’ve got lemon!

>"Hey, Guys, get your
>butts over to the holographic theatre. We got a bogey! A sourball!"

PETER:  Hey!  That’s my first lemon you’re talking about!  Show some
respect!

> All three in the room went, "HUH?"

B-KO & PETER(the latter through “Mr. Bullhorn”):  SHE SAID, “HEY, GUYS, GET
YOUR BUTTS OVER TO THE HOLOGRAPHIC THEATER.  WE GOT A BOGEY!  A
SOURBALL!”!!!!!!!

> "It's a Lemon Fic, you guys! A sourball! Oh, nevermind. Do I gotta >send
>Mew After you?"
> Cypher and REBB both yelled, "PLEASE!"

B-KO & PETER(Cypher and REBB as Stan and Kyle):  OUR SAVIOR!

> "Be at the theatre in ten, Bellchime  out."
>
> Washu muttered, "Damn!"

B-KO(Washu):  Oh poopie!

>
>Later all the MSTer's stood at the door, jockeying for position. Not
>that they all wanted to be first, but as to get through the small
>entrance. REBB about  hit his head on the doorframe.
>
>REBB: (Jerry Lewis) Low Bridge!

PETER(REBB as Jerry Lewis):  Hello nice door!

>
>Mew: Mew? # What did Glyph mean by a `sourball'? #
>
> Ukyo: She meant we have a Lemon
>
> Mew: Mew? # What's so bad about fruit? #

        (B-ko pulls out a clipboard, that has written on it in bold yellow
letters
“Things We Hate About This”.)
B-KO(writing down on the clip board):  Use of joke so old, WE no longer use
it.

>
> Washu: Not that kind of Lemon.
>
> Mew: #??????????#

PETER:  Oh no!  Someone used a confusion attack on it!

>
> Glyph: Wait and find out, kiddo. And what's wrong with the shorthand?
>
> Cypher: You need a Glyph to English dictionary to understand you.
>
> Glyph: Har-dee-har-har. Need a cane on that one.

B-KO:  I need an aspirin.
PETER(digging through his jacket pockets):  I think I have a bottle . . .
B-KO:  Peter . . .  Just let it slide.  You’re giving me an even bigger
headache.

>
> *****Jeff Foxworthy: My favorite word is Sensuous, told my old lady
>Sensuous up, get me a beer.*****
>
> All, but Glyph: What the hell was that?
>
> Glyph: Warning signal for when it starts. The computer will throw out >a
random phrase.

PETER(writing down on the “Hate” board):  Stole screwy klaxon signal joke,
and
used bad Jeff Foxworthy joke along with it . . .

>If you hear one, head here, IMMEDIATELY!
>
> REBB: (Sarcastic) Wunderful!

B-KO(Sarcastic):  Spelling!

>
> Ukyo: Shhhh! It's starting.
>
>>A Tenchi Muyo Fan Fiction.
>
>Washu: (groaning) Oh, no.

PETER:  Oh yes.

>
>>A Passion Satisfying, Ground Shaking, Glass Breaking. . .
>
>REBB: Lawn Mowing, Beer Can Crushing..
>Cypher: UFO Viewing, One Reel Fishing, Butt-crack Showing.

B-KO:  Rip roaring, gang planking, river dumping . .
PETER(to B-ko):  Who’s side are you on!?!?
B-KO:  Sorry, Peter.  Couldn’t help myself.

>
>>By Peter Suzuki.
>
>All: (ala Droopy) Yay.
>
>Cypher: He does do some good work. And he's a good MSTer, in his own
>rights.

PETER:  Thank you.  But I’m not going to go easy on you.
CYPHER(in the MST):  Bring it on!  We can take it!
        (Peter and B-ko both stare nervously at the screen.)

>All the girls: DuUH!

>>WARNING:  Mild LEMON!  Nothing TOO graphic, but younger (or immature)
>>readers should not be reading this.
>
>Mew:  Mew? # Does that include me? #

B-KO:  If the beginning bit was any clue, you may be one of the most mature
people in the theater.
PETER: . . . .

>Washu: No.

B-KO:  I wasn’t talking to you.

>
>>In fact, I don't know why I'm even
>>explaining to you, ANYTHING after the word "Lemon" because if you
>didn't
>>want to read something `sexually explicit' then you would have hit the
>Ukyo: Flame Button by now?
>
>>"Go-back" button by now, right?

PETER(Nelson, pointing at Ukyo):  HAW-HAW!

>
>>Anyway, on with the show.
>
>Washu: Must you?

PETER:  Yes.

>Ukyo: Why, got something to hide, Little Washu?

PETER(smiling):  Maybe.

>#######################################################################

>>EARTH:  4:00a.m.

>Glyph: God, Washu, hit the snooze button again!

B-KO:  A.M.!  Not P.M.!

>        >Yosho was up early this morning.  He did not even really know
>>why, .
>REBB: The constant explosions from the house were starting to get on >his
>nerves?
>
>>other then out of habit.
>
>All: Oh.
>
> >And now he could not even get to see the
>sun rise because of the overcast.
>
>Cypher: That must be some tackle he's using to make to the lake from >the
>shrine.
>Glyph: Wrong type of cast. Although.

B-KO(Cypher):  Who’s “Although”?

>Ukyo: What type then, a full body cast?
>Glyph: I'll put both of you in one if you don't cut that out.
>Cypher: (Muttering) That's a little hard with me.

PETER:  Actually, I was just trying to go for something other than the
“Bright
and sunny day” lemon routine.

>
>
>>  It looked like yet another gloomy,
>>autumn morning.  He let out a bored sigh,
>
>Washu: (Commercial) Yes we have premium sighed Lumber.

B-KO:  Apparently Washu has a problem telling the difference between “bored”
and “board”.

>
>> and continued to drink the tea
>>that he made.  No sense in letting it go to waste.
>
>>Then he heard it, or rather FELT it.
>
>Cypher: (whispering) The paralyzing agent Washu put in his tea must >have
>taken effect.
>Washu: (She puts a finger on a her holographic computer where suddenly
>one of the statues from Furinken High dropped on Cypher)

PETER:  You know, large blunt object aren’t really effective against ‘Silly
Putty’.
B-KO:  ‘Silly Putty’?  I thought he was an overgrown Ditto . . .  I think we
just got our lines mixed up.
PETER:  You can make Pokemon references if you want.  I won’t stop you.

>Ukyo: Did you have to choose one of those?
>Washu: They were heavy enough. And ugly.
>(Cypher flowed out from under the statue, and resumed his place.)

B-KO:  Not even a funny look toward Washu?

>
> > A slight tremor shook the
>>shrine.  Even the birds stopped chirping.  An earthquake?
>
>REBB01: Dang, he can hear Ranma's stomach from there? ***WHANG!!!!!***

PETER:  And Ukyo gives the griff the gong!

>Ukyo: Ranma-honey's stomach isn't that loud.
>REBB01: Ow!
>
>>No, it could not be so.
>
>Washu: ( Panicked) Mihoshi got into my lab again?
>Glyph: The video rental store refused my card?
>Mew: ## Somebody got all 151?##

PETER(holding up his GameBoy):  Right here!

>REBB01: Meg's finally stopped talking to himself?
>Ukyo: Ranma's liked Akane's cooking?

B-KO:  A-ko finally found someone that I’m not already after?

>Cypher: Have the producers decided if Dukat's a good guy or a bad guy?

PETER:  “Flint, The Time Detective” gets an actual plot, therefore making it
too stupid to be good, but to serious to be entertaining?

>
>>In all the seven hundred years of its existence, the Masaki
>>shrine was never effected by earthquakes.  Besides, this felt as if it
>>was caused by something close by.  Something that shook the very earth
>>that the shrine sat upon.  As Yosho got up to investigate, the shaking
>>started again, and did not stop.
>
>        >This could not possibly be an earthquake.  It was more of a
>>slight vibrating, rather than a quake.
>
>Everybody: (Singing) Good- good- good Vib-rations!

B-KO & PETER(singing AND dancing):  Shake-shake-shake!  Shake-shake-shake!
Shake yo bootay!

>
>>Yosho slowly made his way to
>>where the shaking felt strongest.
>>For the
>>first time in a long, LONG time, Yosho was genuinely shocked.
>
>Mew: (Using transform) Pika-CHU!
>Everyone else: Huh?
>Ukyo: How he do that?

PETER: AAH!  Ukyo’s really Shampoo in disguise!!

>
>        >The trees were causing the shaking, or more specifically; the
>>Funaho tree, the Ryu-oh tree, and the trees born from the Funaho >tree's
>
>>seeds were causing the shaking.
>
>Washu: Depends on which series, either Ryu-oh is a real little sapling
>or a tree out in the lake.

PETER:  I thought that you would have moved the Ryu-oh out into the
sunlight,
by now.
B-KO:  And the trees born from the Funaho tree’s seeds?
PETER:  Just a random notion I threw out there.  I figured that if it’s a
tree, it can make seeds.

>
> > Yosho did not move, even as a sapling
>>that had been placed in a pot, gently vibrated across the ground like
>>one of those tabletop football games.
>
>REBB01: Go! saplings, Go!

PETER(Packers fan):  WHOOOOO!!  GO PINEWOODS!!!

>
>        >"Washu." Yosho mumbled.  "If she's not the cause of this, then
>>she must at least have some kind of explanation for this."
>
>Washu: Why do they always blame me first?

B-KO:  Because you’re either the cause of what’s screwed up, or somehow
related to what screwed it up.

>
>        >Yosho then ran as fast as he could, toward the Masaki house.
>>His expression was somewhat reminiscent of how a little child would
>>look, after hearing a big dog bark at him.
>
>Mew: (Back as his normal? Self) ##Hey, Clifford, that you?##
>Everyone else: Obscure!

PETER:  Hey, I understood it!

>Mew: ##Sorry.##
>        >Yosho came to a screeching halt
>
>Cypher: Boy, that he's  got good lungs for an old guy.
>Glyph: Or the lousiest brakes in the world.

B-KO:  Or maybe he has new shoes.

>
>>at the door of the Masaki home.
>>He briefly turned his head toward the front gate, as he heard a slight
>>humming coming from that direction.  He had a very bad feeling of what
>>he would see.
>
>Washu: It would have been hard to miss since he passed the gate the
>first time, getting to the door.

PETER:  Why do you think he came to a screeching halt?

>
>
>> Azaka and Kamidake hovered in mid air, spinning like tops, and
>>shaking like maracas.
>
>Cypher: La cucaracha, la cucaracha.
>Glyph: Hey, Macarena!
>REBB01 proceeded to pick up Cypher and use him as weapon on Glyph.
>Cypher wasn't happy about it.
>Cypher: Cut That out!

PETER:  How do you use a roughly humanoid, protoplasmic blob, as a weapon?
B-KO:  Evidently griff knew a way.

>
>>The
>>mail man walked by, muttered something about `it getting weirder every
>>day', and managed to stuff some envelopes into Azaka on one of the
>>revolutions, before continuing on his way.
>
>Ukyo:( Azaka VERY Excited)BILL, BILL, PERSONAL LETTER, BILL.

PETER(Ukyo as Azaka VERY Excited):  I MAY ALREADY BE AN INSTANT MILLIONARE,
BILL.

>
>>A large sweat-drop formed on
>>Yosho's head.
>
>        >Yosho then heard one of the girls scream from the bedroom
>>window.
>>Without another thought, Yosho rushed into the house.
>
>Mew: ##Shouldn't it hurt going through the front door like that? ##
>
>        >If Yosho would have stayed a minute longer he would have heard
>>Kamidake moan, "S-S-S-o-o-o-G-G-G-o-o-o-o-o-o-d-d-d-!"
>
>Glyph: .To the last drop!

        (Peter makes that annoying slurping noise with his empty soda cup.)
*SHLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRP!!!*

>
>        >In every sense, Washu was not having a good day.
>
>Washu: Yeah, I got stuck in this story.

B-KO:  Not to mention stuck doing this MST.

>
>> First, last
>>night's experiment ended in disaster with only herself to blame, then
>>she was woken up by Ayeka, at this unruly hour, about something
>>happening to Sasami, and when she got to the bedroom she saw THIS.
>
>REBB01: And it was the last thing she ever saw.

B-KO:  Well, that was pleasant.  Is it over now?
PETER:  No.

>Washu: I can bring Azusa Shiratori here.
>Everybody but Washu: NOOOOOOOO!

B-KO & PETER:  NOOOOOOOO!
PETER(to B-ko):  What are we saying “NO” for?
B-KO(to Peter):  I thought you knew.
PETER(to B-ko):  Me?  I was following your lead, mammer-jammer.
B-KO(to Peter):  Do you think we overuse these jokes too much?
PETER(to B-ko):  I don’t think on, soul bother.
        (B-ko Pulls out a giant squeaky hammer, and bops Peter on the head.)
*SQUEAKY!*

>
>        >Sasami lay on the floor, flopping like a fish on dry land,
>>moaning like a banshee. . .
>
>Cypher: ( Sweatdrop) Didn't the banshee in Earth mythology mean that
>death is on its way.
>Glyph: I don't like where this is heading.

PETER(pointing at Glyph):  Hey, she stole Scimitar’s line!
B-KO:  Well so did you.
PETER:  Oh, that’s right.  Sorry.

>
>>and seeming to be enjoying every minute of
>>it.
>
>Ukyo: At least someone is.

B-KO:  Well, it hasn’t gotten that bad.  Yet.

>
> >"Ahh!  AAAH!  Oooh!  Mmmm-YES!!"
>
>        >"And when did you find out about this?" Washu asked Ayeka.
>
>REBB01: (Ayeka) Oh, when she rolled over and slipped me some tongue, it
>gave me the first clue.

PETER:  Ah-ha-ha-ha.  I see griff has seen this already.
B-KO(large sweatdrop on the back of her head): . . . .

>WHANG! WHOP! WHAM! WHAM! WHANG! TANG! TA-TISH!

B-KO & PETER:  Break it down now!  (Both start making rap music noises.)

>REBB01 held his sword up
>and held off the female barrage.

B-KO:  Where did he get the sword?
PETER:  The same place mallets come from.

>Mew: ##Getting better at that, aren't you? ##
>
>
>       > "Well, I got up to get a glass of water.  Sasami then told me
>>that she felt slightly cold.  When I got back with a blanket, I found
>>her like this." Responded Ayeka.
>
>        >"Did you check her for symptoms of sickness?" Washu asked, as
>>she materialized her computer.
>Washu: All right, who put Windows 98 on this thing?

PETER(AOL voice):  You’ve got crap you didn’t ask for!

>
>        >Ayeka looked a little bit distraught about it.
>
>Glyph: Eeesh!
>Mew: ## Why? you like Macs? ##
>Everyone else looked sour at the little critter.

PETER:  B-ko, tell the audience what you found Ayeka doing to the main
computer, up here.
B-KO:  She was trying to shove a manila envelope into the file server.
PETER:  Thank you, B-ko.

>
>>"Well. . .  I
>>DID try to check her for a fever, b-but when I placed my hand on her
>>forehead she. . . she. . ."
>
>Ukyo: (Ryoga) HOKO-DAN.

B-KO(Ranma):  MOKOTAKABASHA.
PETER(Bob Saget):  YERGI GIGAREN.
        (B-ko, and all of the characters in the MST stare at Peter,
nervously.)

>Cypher: Okay, where is he, and how the hell did he find this place?
>Ukyo: Easy, easy, he ain't here.
>Cypher: Next time I see him I'll give the Houkou Onchi a way home!
>Glyph: Frequent Flyer miles. Without a plane. Ouch!

B-KO:  So the in flight meal is pork?

>
>>Ayeka seemed reluctant, and slightly scared
>>to mention what happened next.
>
>REBB01: Does it have any thing to do Ryoko's body hanging limply out of
>the wall?

PETER:  No, that has to do with sake being on the shopping list.

>Everyone else: Fourth wall!!!!

PETER:  Third.  I’m not that desperate for a joke.
B-KO:  Yet.

>
>
>        >Just then Ryoko phased in through the wall, and Ryo-oh-ki
>>toddled in from the hallway.  Ryoko said, "Hey, why are the windows
>>shaking like. . ."
>
>Mew: ## (Cat from RD) ..Like a grass skirt on a fat hoola-hoop >champion.
>##

B-KO:  Like Peter, on a caffeine rush.
PETER(shaking uncontrollably):
IonlyusedthemtowashdownthefiveboxesofchocolateIate!

>Glyph: No more Red Dwarf for you, kiddo.
>Mew: ## Awwwww! ##
>
>>Ryoko then noticed Sasami jerking around on the
>>floor.
>
>Everyone: (singing) Ooo, Cool Jerk!
>

that.

B-KO & PETER: KER-SNAP!

PETER(Mad Hatter, singing):  Oooooooh!  A very merry UN-birthday, to you!  A
very merry UN-birthday, to you! . . .
B-KO(covering her ears):  Peter!!  Stop singing!!

B-KO(Washu):  What she said!

>>Tenchi, from his bedroom, Nobuyuki, from the library, and
>>Mihoshi, from wherever she passed out last,

>Cypher: Where she'd get the toilet ring around her neck?

PETER(Mihoshi with a hangover):  Woah.  I gotta stop drinking so much.  I’m
starting to dream of poorly done MSTs.
B-KO:  Are you referring to them, or us?
PETER:  I don’t know.

>Ukyo: You're really asking for it, you know that?

>>entered into the bedroom.
>>They each saw Sasami, and said, "Washu!!  Did you do something to

>>SASAMI TO BE LIKE THIS!?!?!?!"  screamed Washu.

PETER:  The Washu in the MST said “screamed Washu”?
B-KO:  No, you idiot!  That’s just YOUR fic!
PETER:  Oh . . .  I knew that.

PETER(Sasami):  Mega yiffy, Ryo-oh-ki!
B-KO(to Peter):  I have no idea what “yiffy” means, but if you ever say that
word again, I’ll hurt you.
PETER(large sweatdrop on the back of his head):  Okay, I get the point.

>>Sasami seemed
>>to really enjoy the feeling of the small furry body on her own.

B-KO & PETER(to Mew in the MST):  Your point being?

B-KO:  Chief!
PETER:  McCloud!

>Glyph: I really don't like where this heading!

PETER:  You think that’s bad, I was originally planning on putting in an
inflatable love doll reference, in there.  (B-ko mallets Peter.)  *WHAM!*
OW!

>REBB01: (Ayeka) Naw, for me she kinda went into a sixty-nine.

B-KO:  Did he say that, or did that actually happen?
PETER:  I don’t know.

>Ukyo: Yipe!
>Glyph: Hey! You could have warned us, ya know!
>REBB01: Hey! Let me outta here!

B-KO(REBB01 as a southern belle):  I can not stand tha northern aggression
we
face here!
PETER(to B-ko):  Oh, so you’re the one who drank the coffee I made this
morning.
B-KO:  Sorry.  I thought it was decaff.
PETER:  On THIS station?
B-KO:  I know.  I said I was sorry.

>>"Miss Ryoko, could you two at least wait
>>until Sasami is older?"
>
>REBB01: Sniff, sniff, I smell Lemon scent.

B-KO:  Probably from Sasami doing the dishes last night.
PETER:  Ooh!  Kinky.  (B-ko mallets Peter, again.)  *WHAM!* Ouch!

PETER:  What’s a ‘sherlock’?
B-KO(dressed up as an old English detective):  It’s lack of capitalization,
my
dear Watson.

>>Said Washu as she

PETER(to B-ko):  Did that make sense to you?
B-KO:  No.
PETER:  Okay.  Just checking.

PETER:  We got the idea, Griff.

>
>>"Oh. . .  Help me separate them."
>
>Cypher: Why don't you put them in your centrifuge?

PETER:  Because she wants them NOT to have sex.  *WHAM AGAIN!*
B-KO(lowers mallet):  Now behave yourself, Peter.

>Washu: (defensively) I only did it the once.

B-KO:  And don’t even think it, Peter.
PETER:  Okay, okay!  Don’t hit me anymore!

>        >Tenchi, Mihoshi, and Washu managed to pull Sasami's arms from

>Ukyo: Not so hard, Ryoko. Tenchi's flappin' in the breeze.
>WHAP!

        (Peter reflexively gets knocked out of his seat, as if he was hit by
a
mallet.  B-ko gets a large sweatdrop on the back of her head, but says
nothing.)

>Washu: That's my daughter you're talking about.

and
going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and
going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and going, and
going, and going, and going, and going, and going,  going, and going, and

toward the control booth.) and going, and go-

on
Peter, and the MST resumes.)
B-KO(placing her remote back in her pocket):  Never leave the booth without
it.

scorpion,

PETER(reading TV listings):  “Cheating Transvestite Lesbian Midgets and the
Malformed Eskimos That Love Them”.

PETER:  Apparently it picks up where last night’s show left off.

>WHANG, TISH TANG, HINK, TACK, WHAND-DANG.

PETER(badly dubbed):  The monster named Gamera is destroying the city, huh.

TENCHI(in the fan fic):  We’re not getting paid enough to do this.
PETER(to Tenchi, in the fan fic):  You’re not getting paid anything.
TENCHI(in the fan fic):  Exactly.
SASAMI(in the fan fic, still looking slightly aroused):  Can we hurry this,

term,
used primarily by aristocrat families, to state having an orgasm.

by
it.

B-KO(pointing to Washu in the MST):  Did she just do an impersonation of Tim
Allen, or are we freaking out?
PETER:  I have no idea.

B-KO(suddenly dressed in her Akagiyama battlesuit:  AKAGIYAMA NAPALM!!!

B-KO(helping Peter back into his seat):  Sorry.  Kinda I got carried away.

>Everyone else: You moron, Cut it out!

B-KO:  Look I said I was sorry!
GLYPH:  Not you.  Him! (Points at REBB01, who has set fire to a couple of
the
chairs in the MST.)

PETER:  Uh . . .
B-KO:  Peter, just pretend that nothing happened.  It’s better, that way.

B-KO:  Actually, It’s more like “D’oh”!

PETER:  Practice.

PETER:  Hey, B-ko.  I’m working on something that I need your help with.
B-KO:  Does this have anything to do with the large brown bag, you dragged
in
here yesterday?
PETER:  No.  That was my lunch.  I’ve been working on it in the storage bay,
you have to see it.
B-KO:  Okay, okay.  Just hurry up, so we can get out of here.  Why did you
have to shove all the seats to the sides of the theater?
PETER(moving another seat out of the way):  Hey, you were the one who wanted
swivel chairs for the MST, not me.  There!  Now we can get out.

dark.)
 HEY!
PETER(from outside the theater):  B-ko?  Where did you go?!

Group assessment to MST author;

PETER:  Not the most original thing I’ve seen, but it could’ve been worse.

B-KO:  Keep trying.  You’ll get better.

End of  documentation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHOR’S NOTES:

        Well they say that imitation is the best form of flattery (And
because of my
jokes, I know this better than anyone ^_^;).  I’ve seen worse first MSTs
(You
don’t want to know where, or by who.), and this one HAS potential.  Also,
I’d
like to apologize for using the MST characters in my own comments during
this
MST of an MST.  I can only hope I will not see an MST of this MST of an MST,
because then I’d have to make an MST of that MST of this MST of an MST.  Did
you get all of that?

        Anyway.  What’s this?!?  Peter plotting a precocious plan!?!  B-ko
needed to
assist in the system?!?  What dastardly deed could they be doing!?!  And HOW
will this affect the cast of the Anime Port Number Nine?!?  Tune in next
time;
 Same MST time, same MST station!

EYECATCH:

PETER(to B-ko):  Did what we just do seem at all weird to you?
B-KO:  No.  Why do you ask?
PETER:  Me neither, and that worries me.
