The Girl They Call Mihoshi

(A parody of "The Girl from Ipanema")

---------------------------------------------------------------

Tall and tan and dumb and clumsy
The girl they call Mihoshi goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes
Goes "AARRGGHH!!"

When she walks she's like an earthquake
That knocks things down and leaves things broken
So when she passes, each one she passes
Goes "AARRGGHH!!"

Oh, but I watch her so sadly
How'd I get her for a partner?
Oh, I would ditch her so gladly
But each day, when she goes on a spree,
"Please shoot straight ahead, not at me!"

Tall and tan and dumb and clumsy
The girl they call Mihoshi goes walking
And when she passes, I cry, but she doesn't see
She just doesn't see
No, she doesn't see...
