	Early morning before the sunrise but long after nightfall a silent 
hunter awaits her prey. She has waited for this moment her entire life 
the moment in which she would finally catch her victim and present it 
the fate that is the fate of all her prey. 

She had been tracking this paticular victim for what seemed like a 
eternity she watched helpless as it moved from place to place always out 
of her reach always avoiding its destiny..

Many of its brethern had meet a similar fate however this one was being 
paticulary stubborn. She glanced around quickly..they would be here soon 
they were good people they just didn't understand.. they couldn't 
understand. 

Her eyes fixed quickly on her pray she only had one shot she needed to 
make it count. Closing her eyes she decided to act..only to be caught 
midair by the one she trusted the most.

"Ryo-oki how could you" Sasami scolded "You know the carrots in the 
pantery are for breakfast only".

"Mewo" Ryo-oki asked innocently staring starey eyed at the carrot just 
out of reach.

"Well okay but only one." Sasami responded after making sure no one was 
watching.

"Miaw" Ryo-oki said happily

Sometimes you have to fight for what you want....

..sometimes you get lucky.

 But know this wherever their is evil in the form of the carrot their 
will be Ryo-oki "Carrot Hunter".
