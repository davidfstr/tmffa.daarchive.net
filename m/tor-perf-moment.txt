Notes: I decide it would be nice to write
a theme tune to Tenchi O-Rusuta©, so I did.
It is completely improbable that this is
ever sung by anyone, or that O-Rusuta© will
ever be animated, but I love the music to
Tenchi and the theme tunes especially.
(TALENT FOR LOVE RULES FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!
YEAH BABY, YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) 
So, here it is:
