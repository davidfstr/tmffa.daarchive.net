In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki, who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.

Tenchi Muyo - Vagrant Struggle
Author: Armand

'Luck is one of my skills'.
- Isamu Dyson, Macross Plus

<Washu>What a nice fic. . . FOR ME TO POOP ON!!! - Triumph, Conan O'Brien

- Chapter One -

The sun, eager to heat up the cold earth on the previously black side on the
earth rose once again
behind the cherryblossom
trees in front of the Masaki residence where the crown princess of jurai
soaked in sweat awoke
with a start.

<Tenchi>I guess Faulkner is writing this.

- Yosho!!, She shouted as a demand for him to turn around and face her at
once. Sitting up moments later, remembering that her brother now was an old
haggart who spent his
days sipping tea and trying to
learn his grandson Tenchi the art off fighting, she sighed and felt the
earie feeling of an all but
slight chill.

<Mihoshi>Earie? Is that right?

She looked down and saw a snake crawl up her futon.
- Aiiiieeeeeee, she screamed waking up her sister sleeping at her side.

<Washu>(Snake)Hey nice lady, wanna apple?

- Wha..., Sasami started looking at her sister Ayeka who was obviosly quite
terrified about
something. With a tired sigh she bent over towards the crawling animal and
retrieved it, before
her sister woke up all of the Masaki family members including Detective
First Class Mihoshi and
one additional space pirate.

<Mihoshi>There's an additional space pirate now?
<Washu>It was buy one get one free day.

Ayeka reached out to grab the latest issue of Dazzle wich she with pleasure
would use on the foul
beast,

<Tenchi>(Ayeka)Look at this, snake! It's Cliff! He's dreeeeamy! Now let's
see the latest
hairstyles, hee hee this will get that snake.
<Washu>Tenchi, I think she was going to hit the snake with the teen girl
magazine, not make it
read it.
<Tenchi>Oh. Well, they're both good ideas for killing it.

But Sasami got to it first, taking Ryoko's newly found pet gently by the top
of the tail. Somehow
it had managed to escape from the Terrarium- box the space pirate had put
all yesterday making
and she wouldn't be pleased to find out that it had sneaked out. The snake
was not poisonous but
Ayeka wouldn't know that. And she wouldn't allow something that had been too
near to the
space pirate into her sleeping quarters.

<Washu>So she wouldn't get any Ryoko cooties.
<Mihoshi>How come the author keeps writing "the space pirate" instead of
Ryoko's name?
<Tenchi>::shrugs:: Who knows?

- Sasami, what are you..., Ayeka started.

<Mihoshi>(Sasami)I am a much less-annoying version of Sailor Moon's kid.
<Washu>Who also isn't trying to get jiggy with her future dad.
<Tenchi>To our knowledge.
- Calm down Ayeka, it's not going to hurt you, it's just Ryokos pet.

<Tenchi>Somehow that sentence doesn't seem to make any sense at all.
<Washu>Sort of like "We had to destroy the village in order to save it"

Ayeka shrugged and was about to say that it did not make the situation
better, but Sasami
continued before Ayeka got the
chance and said:

- She would be very unhappy if you harmed it.
- Alright, alright, Ayeka sighed as Sasami lifted the creature off her
futon.
- Where are you going? Ayeka asked as her little sister was preparing to
leave the room.
- I have got to return it to the cage before Ryoko wakes up and finds out
about her little pet's
disappearence.
- Why dont you just drop it out the window?, Ayeka sighed.

<Mihoshi>(Sasami)Weren't you listening a second ago?

It was a pleasant thought to have it out of her life forever but Sasami was
to kind a person to do
such a thing to Ryoko
when she knew it would hurt her feelings.

<Tenchi>And the snake's snake ass.

Sasami walked out of the room without answering and Ayeka felt slightly
ashamed of herself.
Ayeka got up and was about to follow Sasami out the door to say she was
sorry, but regretfully
Ryoko was already up and
Ayeka could hear her talking to Sasami on the other side of the door.

- Well here you go, Sasami said.
Ayeka leaned towards the door to hear the conversation better.

- Oh, i see you found him. I was so worried.
- He's ok. I got him in the nick of time.
- What do you mean? What happened?
- Well, Ayeka sort of...
- She did what? That...
- No it wasn't like that, you see, he got up on her futon and...
- What? I'm sorry i missed that, Ryoko giggled.

<Tenchi>(Snake)Yeah it was totally awesome.
<Washu>(Ryoko)Oh, fooey.

Sasami giggled back and from behind the door, Ayeka frowned and thought
about how much
Ryoko would giggle if Ayeka pushed the creature down her throat.

<Tenchi>I'm guessing, not all that much.
<Washu>Probably not.

- I was wondering what that sound was, Ryoko said continuing to giggle. I
thought it was the
firealarm. Sasami and Ryoko both giggled and then Ryoko asked if it was to
early for breakfast.

- Don't worry, it'll be done in no time, Sasami answered, starting to run in
the direction of the
kitchen.
Ryoko grabbed her arm and moments later they materialized in the kitchen.
- Wow, that was so cool, can we go again? Sasami looked pleadingly at Ryoko.
Ryoko said that after breakfast she would gladly do it over and over again.

<Tenchi>Um. . . .
<Washu>Um. . . ..
<Mihoshi>Yay! Ryoko + Sasami forever!

- We could even take Ryo-ohki out for a ride!
- Horaaay! Sasami smiled with every muscle of her face, dashing towards the
refridgerator.

<Mihoshi>That face workout video has really been paying off.
<Washu>Yeah. Look at the definition and tone.

Ayeka, aware that Ryoko and Sasami had left the hallway, slowly slid the
door open. She
wondered if Tenchi was still asleep.
She could vagely remember what had passed the previous day and she shrugged
at the thought.

<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Ahhduhnnno. . . .

Tenchi had almost kissed Ryoko.

- Just a silly dream, of course, she chuckled with a nervous tone as her
voice broke before she
finished the sentence.

<Mihoshi>Ow. Breaking your voice must be painful.

She knew the emotion was just to strong to be a dream.

They had kissed, almost. Luckily, Ryo-ohki had jumped out in front of them
just when Ryoko and
Tenchi was about ten
millmimeters from each other. Or had she really...

<Tenchi>Gone to get the videocamera and the sex toys.
<Washu>Tenchi!<Tenchi>Sorry, these lemons are starting to really mess my
mind up.

But, Ayekas memory wasn't very clear and she sure didn't like the thought.
She had been
watching, but the sight of the two
must have just been too much. The nearest memory she had was that, and when
she was back in
the house, sitting in the sofa.

<Tenchi>Sitting in the sofa?
<Washu>That doesn't sound very comfy.

She must have blacked out.
Maybe Washu could help her remember...

In his room, Tenchi woke up with a slight look of shame on his face, also
remembering the
previous day.
Not wanting to think about it too much, he quickly dismissed it and started
to get up. With an
embaressed look on his face he
decided to stay in bed a little longer because of a certain reaction of the
dream he had had of
Ryoko that night.

<Washu>Yes, the dream of Ryoko, foxing with Roseanne.
<Tenchi>Arrgh! Get out of my head!

Right then, Ryoko floated trough his door and advanced towards the bed.
One thing pretty irritating with Ryoko was that you could not hear her
fotsteps from time to time
because of the somewhat
bizarre ability of hers to teleport or fly. He thanked his quick thinking of
staying in bed, he would
have died in
embarresment if he had not.

- Good morning, Tenchi, Ryoko greated

<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)All your base are belong to us.
<Washu>I think that's over now, Mihoshi.
<Mihoshi>Oh. Poop.

as she floated down towards his futon with that typical Ryoko-look in her
eyes.

<Washu>Yeah, the "I just did the crotch cha-cha with Roseanne" look.
<Tenchi>Waaah!!!

Feline,

<Mihoshi>Did Ryoko turn into a cat? Is her name Chester?
<Tenchi>What?<Mihoshi>I always though Chester was a good name for a cat.

sexy, and in Tenchis view sometimes frightening, kneeling right next to his
head running her
hands all around his
hair, curling it around one of her fingers. Tenchi, feeling just a bit
amused, wondered if she had
forgotten about the
events the other day.

<Mihoshi>What events?
<Tenchi>Ryoko and I almost kissing..
<Mihoshi>Oh yeah.

- Good morning, Ryoko, Tenchi said.
- Just how are you today, Tenchi? Ryoko asked sounding just a bit nervous.
- I'm fine, and you?, Tenchi answered trying to sound normal, although not
doing very well.
- Same i guess.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes, really.

<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)Why is the bed so squishy?
<Washu>Oh, so that was what that 'certain reaction' thing was. Ha ha.
<Tenchi>Oh come on, nobody really does that.

Silence.

- ... Y'know Tenchi..., Ryoko continued.
- Yes?
- About yesterday...
- Oh... I...
- You don't have to say anything Tenchi, I'll do the talking.
- but I...
- Please Tenchi I...
- Ryoko...?
- Let's just continue as usual ok?, Ryoko said, again sounding a little
nervous.

<Tenchi>Ok, so you'll hit on me and then I'll yell and try to get away and
you and Ayeka will
blow things up. Got it.

- Sure.
- Tenchi...

Tenchi sat up, giving Ryoko a brief hug before turning around, remembering
his slightly exposed
feelings for her.
But Ryoko had seen it and she could guess what Tenchi had been dreaming
about.
<Washu>Her and Roseanne washing the car, but then they got all wet and
soapy, and then-
<Tenchi>Washu!!!! Quit doing that!!!

- Ryoko, could you turn around so i could get dressed?, Tenchi stammered.
- Sure, Ryoko giggled, gleering at him.

<Washu>(Ryoko)Gleer! Gleer gleer gleer!

Tenchi also turned around in case Ryoko would do something silly.
He suddenly felt a warm breath and ten smooth fingers against his neck and
chest.

<Mihoshi>Tenchi had been attacked by Mr Hands.
<Washu>What?
<Mihoshi>You know, the Mr. Bill guy.

Down in her lab, the number one scientist in the universe was as usual
already awake working on
something that looked like a
mix of a vacuum cleaner and a Super Famicom.
The door to her lab was suddenly opened and the crab alerting of visitors
gave up a loud irritating
noise.
- Good morning, Ayeka, Washu sighed in a most omnipotent kind of voice not
even turning
around to face her, and Ayeka did
not like the ring of it. That voice ment hardships. She shrugged.
Still, she needed her help and decided to continue her advance.

- Ms Washu...?
- No! Not unle...
- Little Washu, Ayeka said correcting herself, could you do me a favor?

Washu nodded with a smile.

<Tenchi>(Ayeka)Could you scratch right here?
<Mihoshi>Yay! Ayeka + Washu forever! Ow!
<Washu>And there's more where that one came from.

- You see, there is a certain piece of the previous day that i cannot seem
to remember, so I
wondered if you could retrieve
it for me, Ayeka said with a relieved look on her face adding:
- After all you are the number one genius in the galaxy, I mean the
universe.

- Sure i can, that's easy, and of course you know what I would tell anyone
else because of their
lack of entusiasm, but lets
get going, shall we?
One might think it strange that the crown princess of Planet Jurai and such
an acclaimed scientist
would have such a conversation, but it seemed to get them on the same
wavelength, so why complain?

<Mihoshi>Ooh, same wavelength. . . hee hee hee ::gets popcorn::
<Washu>That's enough!
<Tenchi>Well, at least Ayeka + Washu would be something different. . .
<Washu>Grrrrrrr.....

- Of course there is a hitch, Washu said.
- Uh oh, Ayeka said, and that was all she would be able to say before a
strange ball of metal
floated down behind her
stretching it's arms around Ayeka and holding her on the spot.

Choking down a scream, Ayeka looked furiosly on Washu and shouted;
- Washu let me down at once!
- Don't worry, the hitch was just that you would have to do some tests first
and it'll be done in no
time.
No one heard the crown princess of planet Jurai as she screamed to the very
top of her lungs.

<Mihoshi>Wow, I was right.
<Tenchi>Er, it's true love. . . Washu style.
<Washu>::shaking her head and sobbing::

Up in the kitchen, Sasami was just done making breakfast. A wellspliced pair
of lotus roots with
burdocks and miso soup with
some fried chicken and a carrot for Ryo-ohki, all flavored in a most exact
manner. The soy sauce
right there as well.

<Washu>Unfortunately, the verb was nowhere to be found.
<Mihoshi>Everything went well until the sun god Ra popped out of the lotus
roots, creating the
universe and ruining breakfast.

A tired officer of the galaxy police entered the kitchen.

<Tenchi>This author has a problem with not using character names.

- Oh, hi Mihoshi, i didn't think you were awake yet, Sasami greated
cheerfully.

<Washu>(tired officer of the galaxy police)I'm Kione!
<Tenchi>(Sasami)Oh, sorry, I couldn't tell.

- Good morning Sasami, Mihoshi yawned. What's for breakfast?
- Don't look, Sasami said covering the miso soup, it's supposed to be a
surprise.

<Washu>Miso soup. Gee, what a surprise.
<Tenchi>Well, it's surprising in that it's not a surprise.<Washu>Huh?
<Tenchi>Forget it.

- Oh... Ok, Mihoshi giggled.
Her heart was so much bigger then her brain.

<Tenchi>Yay! Mihoshi + Sasami forever!
<Mihoshi>Um. . . . I don't think that's right. Is that right, Washu?
<Washu>Yes, you are Sasami's bitch.
<Mihoshi>Oh dear. . . I guess I'd better break up with Kione then. She's
going to be pissed.

- Could you please go get everyone Mihoshi?
- Sure Sasami.

<Washu>Yay! Mihoshi + Everyone forever!
<Mihoshi>Washu! Not everyone! I mean. . . . hm, wait a second. . . .
<Tenchi>Washu, don't give her ideas.

Back in Tenchi's room, some strange sounds could be heard.
Some sort of mumbling mixed with moans of pleasure. Inside, Tenchi stood
wrapped in Ryokos
arms. They were in the procedure
of a very deep kiss. Both had opened their mouths in an utterly "in love"
gesture with their
tounges eagerly exploring and
were totally concentrated on each other. They wouldn't hear a meteor drop
outside. Slowly, their
lips parted and Ryoko smiled.

<Tenchi>Then the sun god Ra came in.
<Washu>(Ra)God damn it, I mean, me damn it, not another crappy Tenchi +
Ryoko ::proceeds to
destroy mankind::
<Mihoshi>Bad god. No treat.

- I love you, Tenchi, She said.
- I... I love you too Ryoko, replied nervously.

<Washu>(Roseanne)I love you too, Ryoko. .
<Tenchi>La la la. . . not listening. . . la la la

Ryoko slipped one of her hands down and caressed Tenchis manhood.
Tenchi froze.

<Tenchi>::Yawns::
<Mihoshi>Where'd that come from?
<Tenchi>Been there, done her.
<Washu>The basic Lemon guide, by I.M. Horny, states that if it is a badly
written lemon, it is
okay to move on from kissing, to sappy talk, and then across the finish line
to caressing Tenchi's"Manhood."

- We'll save this one for later, Ryoko smiled teasingly, teleporting herself
out of the room, leaving
Tenchi Masaki alone.
The rest of Tenchi's body was as stiff as his crotch and he couldn't move an
inch. He tried and fell
back and hit his head.

- Ok, Washu said, that about raps it up for now.

<Mihoshi>(Washu)By the way, you're full of my mass eggs .
<Washu>Ugh, that's just. . . . no
<Tenchi>Oh no, Ayeka's going to give birth to 40 Ryokos. . . hey wait a
second! Mihoshi!
<Mihoshi>It's not my fault if you can't keep track of the <>s.

Ayeka, hanging upside down in a pair of shorts and a somewhat to tight
blouse with two lucky
dwarf statues balancing in her
hands nodded and would have said something if it wasn't for one of the
metalball's arms holding
her tounge in a stiff grip,
surveying her teeth, while making some checkups underneath her toenails.

<Tenchi>Ok, I've heard about kinky sex, but that is totally insane.
<Washu>::shakes head::

The metal ball let go of Ayeka's legs and swung her head back up ontop. Then
her usual clothes
materialized on her and then,
at last, the machine dropped her back on the floor.

- Ok, Washu continued, it should be coming up on this monitor any minute
now...

<Tenchi>Becuase the gunk under your toenails has a lot to do with reading
your mind.

Ayeka walked over to the cold, seemingly transparent equipment of gray,
black and white and
clasped her hands together in a
nervous manner.
The screen blinked, and then there was a picture of the snake incident that
morning and Ayeka
quickly pressed the reverse
button on the keyboard.

<Washu>And rewound to footage of her dream that night about Ryoko and
Roseanne hav. . .
<Tenchi>ENOUGH!!!!

Now there was the cherry blossom trees on the way from the house on the
monitor. And there,
standing behind one of them she
saw Ryoko. Slightly squeezing her hands a little tighter together, she
continued to watch.
Ryoko seemed to be waiting for someone, Ayeka thought. And apparently she
was.Tenchi entered the screen and then Ayeka remembered everything. The
monitor was picturing
trough her eyes. Tenchi walked up
to Ryoko and said something. The bad memory recharge regretfully didn't
approve for sound as
well.

- What's he saying, Washu asked, sounding just a bit puzzled. A very unusual
act from the
greatest genious in the universe.

<Washu> You bet it is!
<Tenchi> ::face faults::

She would have to make a sound modifier later.

Ayeka was to concentrated on the scene to answer.
"Oh, hi Ryoko, what are you doing out here?" Ayeka shuddered. She remembered
that's what he
said.
"I was waiting for you T-Tenchi. I knew you w-would come this way on your
way to shool,

<Mihoshi> Tenchi! I didn't know you were jewish!
<Tenchi> I'm not.
<Mihoshi> Oh... What were we talking about?

and i wanted t-to see you." Ayeka
remembered more and more of the conversation she had overheard hidden behind
a rock roughly
six feet above Tenchi's and
Ryoko's head's.

<Tenchi>Yeah, a rock high in the branches of the cherry trees.

"Er, well I..."
"Please Tenchi, I don't know how to say this but... I... No, I just can't
say it.

<Washu>(Ryoko)Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!

Ayeka was -again- about to pass out and Tenchi, obviously trying to say
something romantic and
smart, was clearly becoming a
bit embaressed. This was a new side of the space pirate Tenchi hadn't seen
before, and it made
him quite confused.
"Ryoko, I... I..."
"I am not strong enough to tell you about it yet but there are other ways of
expressing feelings...
Tenchi I..."
Ryoko threw herself in Tenchi's arms and was just about to kiss him when
Ryo-ohki entered the
drama.

<Tenchi>(Ryo-ohki)To be or not to be. . .
"Meow?", she said with a puzzled tone.
Ryoko backed away a bit from Tenchi. Tenchi was unable to speak and Ryoko,
red to the top,
dematerialized.
The monitor went blank just as Ayeka passed out again.

Washu sighed and let a bucket of water appear from a black hole that
suddenly opened up behind
her left shoulder. Washu
splashed Ayeka with the water and patted her on her cheek.

<Tenchi>(Washu)There, there. You were a good bitch.
<Washu>::shudders::

Ayeka woke up, rose and exited the lab without a word.

Back up in the house, Ayeka came out from Washu's lab just just in time to
collide with Mihoshi.
- Er, oh, i'm sorry Ayeka, Mihoshi apologized. Er- Why is your hair wet?
Ayeka kept staring forward and -ignoring Mihoshi- continued on to her room.
Mihoshi, once
again trying to establish
connection tried to say something, whatever.
- Oh, breakfast is ready.

<Mihoshi> But fic me, that is Sasami's line!

Ayeka closed the door to the Jurai bedroom.

Then she screamed.

<Tenchi> Because she just realized she was in yet another stupid fic.
<Washu> AHHHH!
<Mihoshi> What is wrong?
<Washu> We are MSTing yet another stupid fic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What the? What was that?
Tenchi had just finished dressing and was about to open the door to his room
when a high F
stroke his ears like nails on a
blackboard.
He threw the door open and saw Ryoko sitting by the wall smiling in pain
just before the house
fell silent.
- H-hi T-Tenchi, Ryoko greeted about to pass out.
- Ryoko, Tenchi replied, what wass that noise?
- O-oh, d-don't worry, that's just the firealarm, i-it's b-been acting
w-weird
<Tenchi> When there is a fire it starts beeping.
<Washu> That is something Mihoshi would say, right?
<Mihoshi> Yup! No, wait...

all morning. Ryoko tried to smile again, and failed.

- Well it sure sounded wierd, It gave me quite a scare, Tenchi said before
remembering who he
was talking to.
- 'Tenchi' Ryoko whispered with a sensual voice.

Tenchi looked at Ryoko and was about to say something, but Ryoko got there
first, leaned
forward a bit and purred;
- Time for breakfast, Tenchi.
The primal side of Ryoko was back by know and Tenchi found himself staring
down Ryokos
cleavage unable to look away.

<Tenchi>Hey, I think I see ù20 down there!

Ryoko seemed to notice that as well, but she didn't mind much.
Infact, she liked it. Moreover, she loved it. The thought of having Tenchi,
her beloved looking down on her breasts, wich she was very proud of by the
way
Made her quite horny thinking how she would give him a closer look.

<Washu>(Ryoko)Breasts, I'm so proud of you. Now if only you had nipples.

Mihoshi found herself looking for breakfast attenders in Washuu's lab

<Mihoshi> Oh, okay, I'm glad I finally found myself!
<Tenchi> So that means the search for your brain is still in progress,
right?

while Washuu herself stood crying beside her newly
invented super-impulse-mega-tracker-booster wich was spread across the
majority of the floor in
small, smoking parts.
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO TOUCH ANYTHING!, she cried.

<Tenchi>(Mihoshi) I'm sorry, but your breasts were just so juicy.
<Washu> Hey! Tenchi?!?
<Mihoshi> Yay! Washu + me forever! ...Wait, that's not right......

Behind Washuu was a machine with a Mihoshi-warner. "Malfunction" it repeated
over and over.
Mihoshi could get in anywhere
where she was unwanted.
- Wow, what does this button do?
- NOOOOOOO!
<Washu> Wow, just like real life.

Ryoko floated upwards, heaving her chest to the fullest, pressing her
breasts against Tenchi's left
shoulder.
- Tenchiii, Ryoko repeated slowly.
- Y-yes Ryoko, Tenchi said managing his eyes to look in Ryokos face instead
of on her tits.

<Washu> For once!
<Tenchi> What's that crack suppose to mean?
<Washu> You always stare at Ryoko's breasts and you know it!
<Tenchi> I do not!...Well....
<Mihoshi> It's okay Tenchi, I do too, but don't tell Kione!
<Tenchi> Uhhh, okay.

Ryoko hovered against Tenchi, pushing him back in his room. Closing the door
after her, Ryoko said;

- Do you like them?
- Huh?

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)The Chicago Cubs.

- These, Ryoko said, her clothes dematerializing and her hands caressing her
breasts.
- Ryoko, what are you, I, I...
- What Tenchi? Do you like them or not?
- Y-yes, I do, Tenchi finally replied in one breath.
- Want to touch them, Tenchi? Do you want to touch them? Would you like to
massage them for me Tenchi?, Ryoko purred.
- Ryoko, really I...

<Tenchi>Am really disturbed by your lack of nipples.
<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)It's Washu's fault!
<Washu>Sorry, I just forgot. Even a genius isn't perfect!

- Hello, Tenchi may i come in? A voice said accompaning someone knocking the
door.
Ryoko quickly materialized her clothes back on and with an annoyed
smirk dissapeared through the floor.

- Tenchi, hello?

Tenchi recognized the voice as Sasamis and said;
- Yes Sasami, im here, you may come in.
<Washu>(Tenchi) Doesn't that Ryoko know that I only massage Sasami's
breasts?
<Tenchi> What breasts?

Thank God Sasami always knocked before she entered, Tenchi thought. If she
would
have seen Ryoko without clothes exposing herself to Tenchi in his bedroom,
then...
Well, God knows what would have happened.

<Washu> Knowing these fics, she'd probably join in.
<Mihoshi> I would have!
<Tenchi> Too much information! More than I wanted to know! Thanks for
sharing!

Sasami opened the door enough to poke her head inside and say;
- Good morning Tenchi, breakfast is ready!
- T-thank you, Tenchi answered with a shaky voice, I'll be there right away.
- Tenchi, are you okay? You're looking pale again.
- I'm okay Sasami, thank you.
- Okay, bye then.
- S-see you soon.

Sasami shook her head slightly and left.

After an unadventures breakfast,

<Washu> Oh I do wish Sasami would make unadventures breakfasts more often.
<Tenchi> Yes, they are the best kind!
<Mihoshi> They are! Yummy!
<Washu> Mihoshi dear, do you know what sarcasm is?
<Mihoshi> Another type of breakfast?

Ryoko lay in the bath relaxing and thinking.
As promised, she had teleported back and forth the house with Sasami a
couple of
minutes ago, and the little darling just couldn't get enough

<Tenchi> Of the sexy act of teleporting.

They had agreed to cruise a bit with Ryo-ohki after dinner so right know,
Ryoko had
all the time in the world to think

<Tenchi> About getting Sasami in bed.
<Washu>Let's go.
<Mihoshi>Ok.

::They exit the theatre::
<Tenchi>I'm so sick of these darn fics. Let's watch an actual episode of our
show so I can getmy head back to normal.
<Ryoko>Hey, that's not a bad idea.
::Tenchi puts a dvd into the player::
<TV>Tenchi Muyo! Episode 20:No Need For A Fourth Series.
<TVHowlingDude>YooOOOOOOOYYYYYYYYUUUUU (doot doot)
<Tenchi>I can't believe that guy makes more money than I do.
<TV>::Establishing Scene-Masaki House. Tenchi is sweeping::
<TVTenchi>I guess being a Jurai prince isn't all it's cracked up to be, it
seems.
<Tenchi>Hey, I never thought of it like that! Damn.
<TV>::Ryoko appears behind Tenchi:: **THWHWHWHHWHWH**
<Tenchi>Oh no! Look out, behind you!
<TV>::Ryoko hugs Tenchi::
<TVRyoko>I'm going to go bathe in my new swimsuit and drink 'tea'. Wanna
join me?
<TVTenchi>Wait I-
<Ryoko> Wait, Washu. Your DVD player is set to play American DVDs. We should
set it to the
Japanese version.Whaddya say? C'mon.
<Washu>Oh, alright.
::The DVD player rewinds. Switching to Japanese DVD
<TVTenchi>I guess being a Jurai prince isn't all it's cracked up to be, it
seems.
<TV>::Ryoko appears behind Tenchi:: **THWHWHWHHWHWH**
<TV>::Ryoko hugs Tenchi::
<TVRyoko>I'm going to bathe and drink sake. Hey, I'll put wasabi all over
myself. Wanna lick it
off?
<TVTenchi> DO I!?!-
<Tenchi>Wait. No no Put it back on the American vers-
<Ayeka>No. Put it on the Juraian version.
<Washu>Okie Dokie.
::The DVD player rewinds. Switching to Juraian DVD.::
<TVTenchi>BEING A JURAIAN PRINCE IS GREAT! I WANT TO FUCK AYEKA!!!!
<Ryoko>GOD NO!!!!!!!!!!!
<Ayeka> Jurai is loyal to my commands, I guess.
<TV>::Ryoko appears behind Tenchi:: **THWHWHWHHWHWH**
<TV>::Ryoko hugs Tenchi::
<TV>::Ayeka appears.::
<TVAyeka> Go away Ryoko.
<TVRyoko>Okie Dokie.
<TV>::Ryoko goes away never to return.::
<Ryoko>Wow. The Juraian version sucks. A lot.
<TVAyeka>Hey Tenchi. Whaddya say I ..........DICK RIDE YOU LIKE A FUCKING
ANIMAL!!! HUH??? HUH???
<TVTenchi>Anything for the crown princess of Jurai.
<TV>::Ayeka continues to near Tenchi as Tenchi begins to take off his
pants.::
<Ryoko>NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!::Dives and blasts the DVD player. Sparks fly as the
screen goes
blank.::
<Ayeka>Aw, it was getting to the good part, too.<Tenchi>Maybe this wasn't
such a great idea after all.
<Washu>Yeah, let's go back.
::Tenchi, Washu, and Mihoshi return to the theatre::

She had tried getting Tenchi in bed several times, But she had figured out
by
now that Tenchi was the kind of guy that was either a) A wimp

<Washu> Got that right, my Tenchi obsessed daughter!
<Tenchi> Hey!

, or b) The kind
of guy that wanted more feelings then just hard raw sex. Ryoko didn't like
the
thought that her beloved Tenchi would be a wimp so

<Washu> She decided to beat some strength into him by giving him some time
on the rack!
<Tenchi> Stop! WASSSHHHUUUU!!!
<M ihoshi> Yeah, that's Ayeka anyway!

she didn't give it much of a second thought.

But if Tenchi wanted to take it slow with Ryoko, getting to know her better,
and maybe kiss just once in a while and maybe even smooch a little before
they acually did "it" Ryoko would not be the one to protest. She had a lot
of feelings inside of her that didn't reflect very well on the outside,
feelings of love, sorrow, guilt and shame for example. She knew Tenchi was
the man to set them free.

<Mihoshi>Actually, in real life, women tend to end up hating guys who they
want to have sex
with who delay sex forever.
<Tenchi>Yeah, but it's not like anyone writing something like this would
know information like
that.

She wasn't used to expose her feelings with words. She was a woman of
action. When she was mad she fought, when she was sad she cried, and when
she was happy she laughed.

So if she loved someone -Tenchi- she wanted to fuck. Simple. But many did
not like that with
Ryoko

<Mihoshi>Yes, many people had had sex with Ryoko and hated it.
<Washu>What the hell are you talking about?
<Mihoshi>I don't know.

and she knew Tenchi didn't abide for it. But now, when she was a little more
gentle with him, he had acually said he loved
her. That was some advance.

<Washu> Yeah, he didn't run from her like the wimp he is.
<Tenchi> ::shakes head::

Sure, she had nothing against taking it slow. But it would be a lot simpler
and defenetly more fun if they just went right ahead and fucked.

Then there was Ayeka, Prob: Nr2

<Mihoshi> Is Prob: Nr2 the name she wants to be called when she goes to the
incest princess
anonymous meetings?
<Washu> Yes Mihoshi, exactly.
<Mihoshi> Really?
<Tenchi> No.

She would do everything in her power to stop Ryoko's and Tenchi's advance to
be simple. She was in the way. She was a problem.

With her out of the way there wasn't much left between her and Tenchi.

When Ryoko thought about what Tenchi and herself could with Ayeka out of the
way, she couldn't help but getting a little aroused

<Washu> So what else is new?

She moved to the deep end of the womens bath letting only her head left over
the edge, her eyes
in the position of the womens bath door so that she would know if anyone
came in. Then
she let one hand slide down between her legs, leaving the other in breast
height.
She closed her eyes to the half and started masturbating. Her mind drifted
away
towards unknown yet commonly seen spaces.

<Mihoshi>Yay! Ryoko + Ryoko's Hand forever! ::eats some popcorn::

Tenchi and Ryoko were back in his room and Ryoko had just closed the door.
Then,
her clothes dematerialized again and she was naked before Tenchi. She asked
if
he liked them and Tenchi answered he liked them very much.

<Washu>(Tenchi)Yes, I love your clothes. Can I try them on? I wish I could
be a pretty girl like
you, Ryoko.
<Tenchi>::shakes head:

She asked if he wanted to touch them, no, massage them. Tenchi said he'd
love to. He then
proceeded on with rasing his hands towards her breasts, gently caressing
them, moving his thumbsback and forth her nipples.

<Washu>What nipples?
<Tenchi>(Cheech)We don't need no stinkin neeples!

Slightly moaning, Ryoko said she loved it. Tenchi moved one
hand down her stomach to her wet pussy.

<Mihoshi>Aw, cats hate being wet! That one must be upset.

- Oh Tenchi, Ryoko gasped.

Tenchi didn't say anything. He started to move his whole hand in and out of
Ryoko.

<Washu>(Tenchi)God, sticking my dick in here is probably not really going to
be all that much
fun.
<Tenchi>Um. . . . never mind.
<Washu>So then Tenchi jumped headfirst into Ryoko's incredibly loose vagina.
<Mihoshi>Ow. That doesn't sound like very safe sex.
<Tenchi>. . . . . mommy . . . . .

- Tenchi I think i'm going to come, aaaah!, ryoko said, biting her lips to
prevent
her pleasure to go outside of the room to any of the other members of the
masaki
residence. Like Ayeka.

<Mihoshi>Yes, let's keep all the pleasure in here.

In the bath, Ryoko shook her head a bit in frustration, then let her first
orgasm come out,
and continued.

<Mihoshi>Something tells me that was not Ryoko's first orgasm. Just a hunch.

Ayeka was in her room tied up well, upside down on the wall. Oh, and with a
sock
in her mouth. Tenchi and Ryoko themselves were nolonger in Tenchis room.
They were
in Ayekas. Right in front of her, making passionate love. Ayeka tried on and
on to
free herself from the stinking sock in her mouth, to order the two to stop.

<Washu>(Ayeka's Brain)What are those two doing? It looks really stupid.
<Mihoshi>So much for Jurai's sex ed program. . .

- Relax princess, no-one will hear you anyway, ryoko mocked.
- Yes, try to enjoy it, Tenchi added.

Ayeka, still trying to free herself was once and for all trapped, and they
both laughed at her and proceeded.
<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)Oh Tenchi, let's proceed all night!
<Tenchi>Oh yes, I love proceeding with you, Ryoko.

Tenchi ordered Ryoko to stand on all fours, adding;
- Watch this, Ayeka.
Tenchi then moved towards Ryokos ass and gave her a brief kiss on her pussy
before ramming his cock into her.

<Washu>My, what a vivid imagination Ryoko has.
<Mihoshi>Just remind me never to use that bathroom again. . .

In the bath, Ryoko inserted her whole hand into herself and bit her jaws
together.

- Oh Tenchi, yes, fuck my cunt, fuck me, fuck me.
Tenchi went on faster and faster and his cock just kept on growing, just
reaching
nine inches.

<Tenchi>I am King Arthur. Behold Excalibur.
<Mihoshi>::faints::
<Washu>::dumping water on Mihoshi:: it's not really that big.
<Mihoshi>Oh.
<Tenchi>......sob......

Ryoko dematerialized from his cock just to appear moments later with
her face next to it. She immediatly started kissing and licking it, from the
root
to the swollen tip. The she slid her tounge up his shaft once more before
taking it
into her mouth.

<Tenchi>Ow.
<Mihoshi>I guess Ryoko has one of those insane butterfly tongues that's a
long thin thingy.
<Washu>No, you're just confused again.

She had just built up a good rytm when Sasami, without knocking
entered the room.

- Hi Ryoko, having fun? she greeted.

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)No, this is just a test of the emergency sex system. This is
only a test.

- Mmhmm, ryoko answered.
- Can I play to? she asked, her face turning to the innocent and ecxited
form
that Ryoko loved so much.
- Mmmm, Ryoko replied.- What?

<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)Mmmm
<Washu>(Sasami)Oh, I get it.

- Sure, your welcome, Tenchi said.
- Horay!
Sasami went over to Ryoko and started to lick her c...

Ryoko went red back in the bath and felt ashamed.

Mihoshi went over to Ryoko and started to lick her cunt.

<Washu>Yay! Mihoshi + Ryoko forever!
<Mihoshi>What the? I wasn't even there!
<Tenchi>You're just subbing in for Sasami. Anyway, this is just Ryoko's
masturbation fantasy,
remember?
<Washu>I think you mean this is just *Armand's* masturbation fantasy,
Tenchi.
<Tenchi>Oh, yeah.

- Mmmmm, yesh, mmmm, Ryoko moaned.
Ryoko felt Tenchi twitch a bit in her mouth, and then he exploded into her,
filling her mouth with cum.

<Tenchi>Catch the rainbow of fruit flavors!!

A lot Ryoko couldn't swallow. It flowed out of her mouth and trickled down
her throat between
her breasts advancing towards her clit.

<Washu>Behold the power of gravity.

But Mihoshi got there first and went on sucking Ryokos pussy.

<Mihoshi>Sucking this cat is getting lots of hair on my tongueth.

>From there she licked up Tenchi's sperm all the way from her stomach to
Ryokos
messy mouth. Once there, Mihoshi gave Ryoko a deep kiss, sliding her tounge
through
her mouth licking up all the cum that hid in Ryokos teeth and under her
tounge.
Just then, Ayeka had finally managed to free herself from the wall, darting
towards
Ryoko inserting a dildo larger then sin itself into her cunt.

<Washu>This isn't Ryoko, it's Noboyuki in drag.
<Mihoshi>::Yawn:: is it over yet?

Ryoko could take no more. Her second orgasm came with all the might of a
super.
<Washu>You mean like the Eddie Murphy guy from the Pjs?
<Tenchi>Yeah. That's what he meant.

Her screams ecoed through the wimens bath.

<Mihoshi>(Ryoko)AHHHH AHHHHH AHHHHH I'M NOT GOING TO PAY A LOT FOR
THIS MUFFLER!!!!!!!!!

Lucky thing that Washuu had made it sound proof. When Ryoko was just about
to regain control
of her senses, The door opened and the crown princess of planet Jurai
entered.

<Washu>Ryoko.
<Mihoshi>Washu, stop giving away the plot.

Ryoko froze. The bath wich she was in was filled to the brink with Ryokos
lovejuices and Ayeka
would with no doubt notice that. Especially the smell. Ryoko quickly removed
her hand from her
still hot cunt and let the hand that had been massaging her breasts swing up
behind her neck

<Tenchi>(Ayeka)Um, never mind, I'll take a bath later, ohohhohohhohohoo
::runs off to tell
everybody::
<Washu>Tenchi, you imitate Ayeka's laugh too well. It's terrifying.

Just then, Ayekas and Ryokos eyes met. Ayeka turned away almost instantly
after
and left Ryoko, slamming the door behind her. Ryoko didn't give her a second
thought. She immediately flew out of the bath towards the control device for
the
pool. With one swish of her wrist she drenched the water out, put on the air
conditioning and started the little waterfall thingy were she could wash up.

<Washu>Regardless of this, I still destroyed the bath with several nuclear
weapons later.

Outside, Ayeka stood leaned at the door.

<Mihoshi>That crazy Ayeka. Always stood-leaning on everything.
<Washu>She's so silly!

She was thinking about what Washuu's mind-recovery machine had shown her.
Ryoko had been
honest and forward about her feelings, and Tenchi seemed to like it before
Ryo-ohki had entered.

<Washu>. . . .
<Mihoshi>::giggles::
<Tenchi>YOU GUYS!! QUIT IT!!

Maybe he wanted Ayeka to be forward to?
<Mihoshi>He wanted Ayeka to be forwarded to Jurai.

She decided to skip bath now that she knew
Ryoko would be out of the way.

<Washu>Yes, because the first step to win Tenchi's heart is to smell bad.
<Tenchi>Mmmm, stinky bitches, ya got those stinky britches. . . .ow

She would at last have some time alone with Tenchi.
Tenchi would be back in his room by now, reading his homework. Ayeka started
to walk
towards her room. She needed to get dressed. Or did she? Maybe Tenchi would
prefer
without clothes? Maybe without even the towel? Ayeka shook her head. Clearly
she was
getting a little desperate.

A couple of minutes later, she was outside Tenchis room, in her ordinary
clothing.

<Washu>For Ayeka, "ordinary clothes" is a contradiction..
<Mihoshi>A wha?
<Washu>Just forget it.

Knock, knock, Tenchi may I come in?, Ayeka thought for herself.

<Washu>(Tenchi)Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.
<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll. . . . Azaka!
Kamedake!

Yes that would have
to do. She raised her hand and knocked Tenchi's door.

<Washu>(Door)Oh no I've been knocked up by Ayeka.

- Tenchi, may I come in?

<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)My princess underwear?
<Tenchi>Ewwwwww.
<Washu>She asks for permission? Wow, Jurai really is strict.

, Ayeka said, satisfied with how it had sounded.
- Sure Ayeka, come in, it's open, Tenchi answered, sounding normal.

<Washu>If you define normal as really wussy.
<Tenchi>.....sniff.....

Ayeka slowly opened the door to Tenchis room, her head bowed, looking down
at the
floor. She closed the door and raised her head to meet his eyes.
<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Trick or treat!

Later, out in the living room, Tenchi sat thinking of what had transpired
that morning.
He remembered what Ryoko had asked him to do.

<Washu>Namely, her.

She wanted him to massage her tits.
The mere thought of Ryokos well-formed breasts was enough to give him a
hard-on.
And a real hard hard-on with that. He was sitting in the couch in front of
the tv,
leaned back with his eyes staring at the roof. The pants he had on did
little to
hide his dick. But Tenchi was to wrapped up in his thoughts to think about
that
as well.

<Tenchi>But apparantly others were less distracted.

He liked Ryoko, loved Ryoko, yet his cowardice with women resulting from the
early death of his mother stopped him from expressing those feelings.

<Mihoshi>It's society's fault.

He had been a very quiet person before Ryoko, Ayeka and Mihoshi entered his
life.
They had changed him alot, but not completely. He was more open now then
before, he could talk more calmly to girls, yet he was still a coward when
it came to women and froze whenever sex, love or even feelings came up.

<Washu>And when that happened, people would use him to help cool their
orange juice. So it
was all good.

But he was a formable man and he would prove it to them. But he was going to
need
some help.

<Mihoshi>(Tenchi)Help me, corporal capeman!

And then there was Ayeka. She had been acting wierd all morning, especially
at breakfast where she couldn't get much in her mouth due to her shaking
hands, wich spoiled every attempt she made to pick anything up, or hold her
feedingsticks.

<Mihoshi>Feedingsticks? Wha?
<Washu>Yes, Ayeka is a rabid animal in the insane zoo who must be fed with
feedingsticks.

And then, when he was reading homework, she had entered his
room, closed the door... And after a couple of moments silence, she had
acted
just like Ryoko, expressing her feelings, telling him all about how she felt
about him and then started to cry.

She was not as pushy as Ryoko, Ayeka at least didn't try to get him in bed.
Not that he would have had anything against that. *Liar* he thought to
himself.
He would have pushed her away, just like he did with Ryoko. Cowardice, he
thought.

<Washu>Either that, or Tenchi is just not ready to have sex. Ever think of
that? Huh?
<Tenchi>Could we not talk about this?

Sasami, happy as a clam,

<Tenchi>(Clam)Wheeeeee!!!!!!

jumped past Tenchi from behind the couch. Tenchi
saw nothing more then her hair, but he recognized it as Sasamis and was
quick to lean forward to cover the somewhat embaressing position of his
penis.

<Washu>And so Tenchi hid the fact that his penis was the director of AOL's
marketing
department.

But Sasami had barely noticed Tenchi, for she was still in heat after
teleporting with Ryoko, and she could hardly wait until after dinner, when
they were to fly with Ryo-ohki.

<Tenchi>Sasami. . . . in heat?
<Mihoshi>Well, isn't she part tree?

Yet, somewhere in her happiness she saw a troubled Tenchi sitting in the
couch
to the left of her, semingly with problems up to his ears.
- Oh, hello Tenchi, she greeted.
- Hi, Sasami, Tenchi mumbled.

<Mihoshi>Oh no! Sasami is high!
<Washu>You just noticed that?

Trouble, thats for sure, Sasami thought before continuing;
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- C'mon Tenchi, i can see your bothered by something.
- Nothing.
- Wont you share it with me, huh?

<Tenchi>Ok, here's some nothing.

Sasami has started, theres no getting out, Tenchi thought.
- I don't think you can help me with this, Sasami.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- Try me.

<Washu>I'm frosted!

- *Sigh*
- C'mon Tenchi, let it out.
- It's about love, okay?
- Oh...
- Please, Sasami, I'd rather be alone right now, okay?
- Sure, I understand, I'll leave you alone.

Sasami let out a sigh and left the living room.

<Mihoshi>SASAMI HAS LEFT THE LIVING ROOM (Sasami)Thank you. . . . thank you
very
much.

Tenchi continued with his thoughts.

Now, whenever love would come to close to the subject he would get
paralyzed.
Because his brain simply short circuited whenever it came up. He had loved
his mother, the time she was there, and she had given him quite a burn when
she
died that wouldn't go away. That burn came back whenever feelings about
women came back.

<Tenchi>Ow ow ow.

Women alone made him paralyzed. And he had two, at most three,
with Mihoshi. They all loved him, he knew that, especially Ryoko and Ayeka.
They wouldn't think twice if Tenchi wanted to marry one of them. Or even
sleep
with them.

<Washu>Especially if they were really tired.

But that was another problem, Tenchi couldn't make himself choose one
of them when he knew how it would hurt the other. He loved both of them. But
they
simply could not stand each other.

- Tenchi?, a voice said.

<Washu>(AOL Voice)You got mail!
<Mihoshi>(Tenchi)Shut up, penis!
Tenchi, who had his elbow on the table in front of him and his cheek in his
palm, jumped slightly at the noise once again disturbing his thoughts.

- Yes Ayeka?, Tenchi replied with a somewhat tired voice.
- Am I disturbing you, Tenchi?
- No, not really.

<Mihoshi>Yeah, just imaginarily.
<Washu>Imaginarily isn't a word.
<Mihoshi>Neither is 6,437.
<Washu>Well, touche.

Ayeka could hear he was lying.

- Do you want me to leave?
- ... Actually, no. There's something I would like to talk with you about.
- What?, Ayeka said slightly nervous sitting down next to him.

<Tenchi>Is it normal to want to have sex with Ms. Pacman?
<Mihoshi>Ewwww!!!!
<Tenchi>No really. I really want to know.
<Washu>Let me check ::consults her computer:: Yes, it is.

Was this it, Ayeka thought? Would he tell her he loved Ryoko and repel her?

<Washu>Maybe.
<Mihoshi>Hm, maybe not.
<Tenchi>No, because then the show would end.

Or would he say he wanted no other than Ayeka and send Ryoko away?

<Washu>No.
<Mihoshi>No.
<Tenchi>No.

With her heart pounding, and her face red, Ayeka asked Tenchi what was the
matter.

- Do you know where Ryoko is? Tenchi said.

<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Trying to play the name game and banging her head against
the wall in pure
frustration.

Ayeka frowned slightly, thinking all was lost, and said;
- She's in the bath. Would you rather talk to her?
- No, no that's not what I want, Tenchi quickly answered.
Feeling maybe a ray of hope Ayeka was just about to say something but Tenchi
got there first and said;
- I want to talk to both of you.
Ayeka sighed and replied;

<Tenchi>(Ayeka)So you found out about that yuri thing.

- Do you want me to go get her?
- Only if it's ok with you.

Ayeka could think of little that would be worse then fetching her rival for
Tenchi

<Washu>Come on Ayeka! Come on! Fetch the Ryoko! Go get it girl! Go get it!
Good dog!
<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Woof! Woof woof!

in what could be a recognision of losing him to Ryoko, but as always,
she did what she could to make a good impression.
- Of course.
Ayeka rose from the couch and exited the living room, leaving Tenchi with
his thoughts.

<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)On second thought, I'll take those with me. Yoink!
<Tenchi>Duh duh duh duh.
<Washu>::shakes head::

Ayeka started to walk towards the womens bath. Trying not to think of what
Tenchi
would say to them, she casually stretched her arm out to open the door to
the
bath, but before she reached the door, Ryoko flew out of it right on Ayeka.

<Mihoshi>(Ayeka)Oh yes! Fall down all over me!

Ayeka gave up a short shriek and -not knowing what had hit her- tried to
grab
something to pull herself back to safety. She wrapped her arms around Ryokos
neck
and they both fell down on the floor.

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)Help, I've fallen . . . and I can't get up.

This was a bit embaressing position for the crown princess to be in . Ayeka
was lying on the floor on her back still with her arms wrapped around Ryokos
neck. One leg lay flat on the floor and she had raised the knee on the other
as a reflex. On her, Ryoko lay with her face pushed deep down Ayekas
cleavage
unable to move due to Ayekas grip around Ryokos neck. She had her legs
widely parted and with her green-pink dress on, Ayekas knee found a perfect
fit
between Ryokos legs.

<Washu>A preoccupation with sex is a sign of malnutrition, you know.

In her confusion, Ryoko remembered her fantasie in the bath and became
slightly aroused.

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)Ta ta ta ta ta ta touch me
<Washu>The Tenchi Horror Muyo Show will be right back after these messages
from KY.

Ayeka, on the other hand, opened her eyes and wasted no time thinking before
she let
go of Ryokos neck and pushed her away from her.

<Washu>Wha?
<Mihoshi>It's yuri time, la la la.
<Washu>As if you know nothing at all about that. . . .

- Wha-wha-what are you doing Ryoko?

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)Just checking your oil.

Ryoko was still confused but managed to ask Ayeka what she meant.
- Well, you-you, haven't you ever thought about opening a door instead of
moving through it?
- No.
- Well i must ask you to..., Ayeka started, but then remembered why she was
there and
turned her face away.
- Ryoko, Tenchi would like to have a word with us.
- Oh, he is to proclaim his love to me already? I see, hmmmm? Ryoko teased.
- Now you just... You... Be quiet and lets go!
- Fine, lead the way, Ryoko said, ending the conversation.

<Washu>A shame, that.

Ayeka started to move quickly towards the living room. Ryoko first just
watched
her leave and looked at her hand. She had accidently touched Ayeka between
her
legs with it when Ayeka pushed her away.
- Wet, she thought.
Ryoko shrugged unnoticably and went after Ayeka.

<Tenchi>(Ryoko)Hey everybody, smell my finger!
<Washu>Oh no, Ryoko has resorted to chemical warfare!

Ayeka looked at her left knee while walking down the stairs, and a chilling
realization
hit her.- Wet, she thought.
Ayeka shrugged unnoticably and continued.

<Mihoshi>Yay! Ryoko + Ayeka's Knee forever!
<Washu>Could you stop doing that?

Back in the living room, Tenchi waited for the two to return, and once they
did. he
asked them to sit.

Tenchi waited a moment, gathering his thoughts. Then he spoke.
- Ayeka, I love you, he said.

<Washu>(SpaceGhost)I love you, Birdman. We had sex.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preview of next chapter:

- Not this first time since I'm not sure wether I should make a next chapter
or not.

<Tenchi>It's unquestionably undecided.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my very first fanfic, and I'm not sure wether I should put up the
next part. First I need
some positive feedback. Why write if nobody reads it? I'll read flames, for
a laugh. That is, the
flames with no constructive sentences whatsoever. I would be grateful for
any kind of feedback.
Thank you!
