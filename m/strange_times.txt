Tenchi Muyo!:  Strange Times

Read My Other Works!  They're not as strange!

=-=-=-=-=

        It's been a year since she landed on Earth.  Though she hasn't ignored
her duties as a princess, she wants nothing more than to be with her one
and only.

        Although her arch rival can match her in power, she believes she will
triumph over the space pirate.  After all, good wins over evil, right?
With that thought in mind, her confidence in the matter simply soars.

        Her younger sister has at times shown interest as well.  But, the First
Princess of Jurai is not worried.  Her sister will most likely abandon
her crush once she gets older.  She's still young, after all.

        Her sister's older counterpart is another matter.  If she wanted to,
the blue haired woman would have no problems taking the man that is
often foughht for.  She claims to have had her time with him, and has a
daughter to prove it.  This only adds caution towards her younger
sister.  If it happened once, it can happen again.

        The police officers seem to have shown no interest in pursuing a
relationship with him, which lightens the mood.  Having moved out makes
things even better.  Not that she doesn't like them, but eight girls in
one house can be a little crowded.  Even if one is only nine and the
other only a few months.

        One person sticks out.  The mad scientist.  She's only shown moderate
interest in him, and that's only when she needs him for something.
Usually, though, the little red-head is only interested in her
experiments.  Another helpful point.

        As another day ends, Ayeka is lying on her futon, just staring at the
ceiling.  Not being able to sleep, she sees that her sister has long
left for slumberland.  With Ryo-Ohki on top of her, the pair both look
quite content.

        <I wonder what they're dreaming about?  I suppose Ryo-Ohki dreams about
carrots all night.  But, I wonder what Sasami dreams about?>  Trying to
distract herself in thought, she hopes to fall asleep herself.  <She
does have nightmares from time to time, but who doesn't?>  Finally,
sleep takes her.

~~~~~~~~~~

        In a forested area away from the house, a man with a shaded face is
with Ayeka.  Right away, she sees him as Tenchi.  It couldn't be anyone
else.

        As the two walk into the woods, they stop and Ayeka looks at him.
Looking at her hand, she notices a ring around her finger.  <At long
last.  I've finally done it.  I finally married the one I love.>

        The man, face still shaded, puts his hands on her shoulders and brings
his face forward to kiss his wife.

        Ayeka responds by closing her eyes to accept him.  Not even wondering
why his face is in darkness, she kisses him herself.

        Slipping his hands inside her kimono, he pushes it off her body,
leaving her completely clotheless.

        She doesn't care about her new condition.  If it's him, then everything
will be fine.  She responds to this action by attempting to pull off his
shirt.  Pulling from the kiss, she finally sees his face in the light.
But, it's not what she thinks.  There in front of her is not the form of
Tenchi, but of his grandfather.  "Katsuhito?!" she says, almost
screaming.  "AAAAAAAAA-

~~~~~~~~~~

        -AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!"  Waking from her odd experience, she sits
up and sees that Sasami and Ryo-Ohki are still sound asleep.  Lying back
again, "now I'll never get back to sleep."

-End?-
