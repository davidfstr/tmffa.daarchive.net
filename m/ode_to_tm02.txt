Ode to Ryoko: Her Devotion.

Author's note: Ryoko is my second favorite, and was created by my first! She deserves Tenchi, only because she'd do anything for him. Ayeka doesn't show her affection for him, he's just a thing to her. Like on 'Hello Baby'... 
Ayeka: Tenchi has been MINE since before he was born. 
NEWAYS, I take no credit in the creation of 'Ryoko', she is copyrighted by the creators of Tenchi Muyo.

She sat in a cave,
And watched as he grew.
She loves him so much,
If only he knew.

She hides it inside,
But she really can't bare
The thought of losing her love,
never knowing he cared.

The long sleepless nights,
She watches him sleep.
Her endless devotion,
Her heart's his to keep.

She needs nothing else,
But to gaze at his face.
And to know he will love her,
Someday, and Someplace.

His love isn't sure,
But she'll patiently wait.
For when he will proclaim,
That she's his soulmate.

She may be a bother,
And sure she has sinned,
But it's always for Tenchi,
And love, in the end.

THE END
