     If you are one of those disillusioned Ryouko fans who think's that
Nothing happened in her past for her to feel sorry for, CLICK THE BACK
BUTTON ON YOUR BROWSER IMMEDIATELY!
     If you are of the open minded sort who believes that the tragedy
of her past has made her a stronger person, I guess this song's for you.
     If you haven't heard this song before, I'll try to make it make
sense.

(Lead Vocals:  Ryouko)

Mother, Mother Wasyuu, or so you'd have me call
I've been a rouge in this galaxy since I was very small
I've seen bout it all, seen bout it all
Seen a lot of good men die for crossin' my path
And in my life I stole more treasure than most will ever have
It was pretty bad, was pretty bad
I am a space pirate,  a thousand years to date
The cannon's thunder
Is not quite a wonder
When it's aimin' for your face
By people you hate, the people you hate
I've done a bit of murder, I kicked my share of tail
Stole enough money to buy Miami, but couldn't even make bail
Rottin' in jail, I'm rottin' in jail
And where have you been now for all of my life
when Kagato took me and ruined my life
Though I'll just stop accusin'
That kind of abusin'
Cut me deep as a knife, deep as a knife
Well I found a young man, Tenchi, Live with him for a while
Almost scared him away
But his dad lets me stay
And sometimes can manage a smile
Just takes a while, Just takes a while
Mother mother Wasyuu after all the years have passed
My occupational hazard bein', My occupations kickin' my ass
I feel like I've drown, but I won't stay Down
I feel like I've drown, but I won't stay Down

Authors Notes:      In the past I've been a bit of a Ryouko basher,
having seen no reason to for give her history.
     After reading No Need For Tenchi: Tales of Tenchi#79, I got what
no Ryouko fan had given me.  A specific instant when Ryouko showed remorse
for her crimes.  She isn't #1 for me for it, but at least she's
human.
     Oh,  and I've heard the Kagato argument before.  And having been
forced in to that life should have made her look even harder to be forgiven
for it.
     I won't argue this point anymore, it's a dead horse.  So until
next time, SLIDE!
