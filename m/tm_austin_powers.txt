"'A swinging shindig --
Yeah, it's my happening, baby,
And it freaks me out!'"

Yosho put down his pen and grinned. "Smashing, baby! Smashing!" he
exulted, just as Kiyone walked in. Yosho's eyes slowly traced up and down
her figure. "Man, Kiyone's got a fabulous body," the old priest said.
"I'll bet she shags like a minx!"

Kiyone stopped, a horrified look on her face.

"I wonder if she realizes that due to my Jurai power I have no inner
monologue," wondered Yosho. He blinked. "Oh, did I say that out loud?"

After clearing her throat, Kiyone put on her best professional bearing. "I
just got here with an important message from Jurai, Your Highness. Your
father the Emperor has some important questions for you to answer about
Jurai's future."

"O contraire, baby! *I've* got a question for *you*!"

Kiyone frowned. "What question?"

Yosho touched picked up the Tenchiken from his desk. It glowed as it drew
power from the holy tree Funaho outside. A large, round, rotating bed
popped up out of the floor, and the room darkened except for the multi-
colored psychedelic lighting that suddenly appeared. The priest jumped
down onto the bed on all fours, wiggling his behind at the shocked Galaxy
Police officer.

"Do I make you horny? Randy? DO I MAKE YOU HORNY, BABY? YEAH!!!"

With a groan of utter disgust, Kiyone put her face in her hands.

"IF THIS SHRINE'S A-ROCKIN', DON'T COME A-KNOCKIN'!"

(Sorry, Kathleen, but you *MADE* me do it... ^_^ )
