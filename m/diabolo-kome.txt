	DIABOLO- AGENT OF KOME!

(Diabolo is sitting in the Kome cave,
a very dark and gothic building covered
on every wall by pictures of Mihoshi
Karumitzu, poems to her by fans, the
KOMESUITS (armour in silver, white and
gold for holy knights) her clothes and 
little pink motifs which the lovely girl
herself put in with the assistance of 
Lord Scion the Defender. Diabolo is on duty
at the moment, looking out for evil...and
writing a poem)

Diabolo: There was a young girl call Mihoshi,
Who wanted to work for the G.P 
But when caught in a pass,
She kicked snakes in the...

Computer: Beep! Beep!

Diabolo (starting): What? A BLONDE ALERT?

(Diabolo brings up a screen, on which an
author is writing an Anti-Mihoshi fic)

Diabolo: A Mihoshi hater? I will deal with him!

(Diabolo puts on a white KOMESUIT and takes
the KOMOBILE to deal with this heathen.
Meanwhile, in the evil author's Den Of Ill
Repute...)

Author: Hmmm..."Mihoshi, like a vacuous
yellow-mopped retard, tripped over a speck
of dust and caused the deaths of a million
people". Perfect!

(Diabolo bursts in)

Diabolo: You evil creature! Back! Back!

Author: *gasp* Who are you?

Diabolo: My name is Diabolo...I work for KOME!

Author: Arrrrgggggggg!

Diabolo: Now you see the error of your ways-
insulting the goddess Mihoshi is blasphemy!
You must be punished!

Author: Please! No...I renounce my ways...

Diabolo: Who are YOU a fan of, heretic?

Author: I am a fan of the great Kiyone!

Diabolo: Aha! A Kiyone fan AND Mihoshi hater...
the rarest of all Tenchi fans! You must be... 
CONDITIONED!!!!!!

Author: Conditioned? The cruelest punishment
an Otaku can suffer...please, oh knight of 
KOME, harm me not...

Diabolo: How dare you speak the name of our 
organisation?! I am obligated to condition you,
Mihoshi hater!

Author: Noooooo!!!!

(Diabolo advances on the Author and...)

      ****THIS IS A COMMERCIAL BREAK*****

Announcer: Have you ever wondered about 
BRAINWASHINGtm? I mean, is it really that bad? 
Have you ever considered the ADVANTAGES? 
If your irritated by all those little
things, you can use BRAINWASHINGtm to stop it! Yes,
the new BrainWash2000 can solve all your problems
by just "'washing'" them away!!!!!

Dumbass: I used to be an irritating moronic dumbass
who bought everything advertised on T.V. by maniacal
announcers, but thanks to the BrainWash2000 I am now
more assertive, more forethright, more powerful...

Announcer: Shut up.

Dumbass: Okay.

Announcer: Yes! If you don't like tomatoes, WASH
yourself there! If you have too many scruples, then
BrainWash2000 is always there!

        THE BRAIN WASH 2000 AND HAKUBI-
        Messing Up Your Mind Since 1903!

        **************END*************

Author: Wow! I never realised Mihoshi was such
a deep and lovable character whose blunders are
lamentable but sweetly childish and give a 
great angle to the whole of Tenchi!

Diabolo: You see? Now get down some Mihoshi gets
Tenchi fics and some Miho-lovers-rants for the
misc. section.

Author: Yes sir! 

Diabolo: Good. (turns to camera) Although this
may also seen very incredible, but it's just another 
day in the life of us KOME employees, and another
evil Author defeated by Diabolo- Agent of KOME!!!

THE END

I wish being a member of the great Armoury
was like that. Still, I wouldn't advise anyone
of you evil Miho-haters to go up against us. 
Many are we and Powerful, and lead by Lord Scion
we can take on almost any other fan club.
Long live KOME!
