Dargonis's Thanks: Naturally I want to thank GenSao for putting my MST up on 
his site.  And a special thanks goes out for Bryan Weber.  Without your help 
this would have sucked.  I know it, you know it, everyone now reading this 
knows it.  Ok, it probably wouldn't have sucked but it wouldn't have been as 
good as it is now.  You rock, man.

Dargonis's Warning: If you are reading the Wheel of Time series and haven't 
finished the second book (or at least gone through half of it) and don't 
want any spoilers then DON'T READ THIS!

Dargonis's Disclaimer: I do not own Duo, Washu, Rand, and characters in the 
lemon being MST'ed.  They are owned by the respective companies that happen 
to own them (oxymoronic comments are fun).  All I own is Dargonis, unless 
some jackass wrote some story with a character named Dargonis, though I 
doubt it would have any relation to my Dargonis.  On a final note, don't sue 
me.  Sue the people that make the lemons that get MST'ed.  They bastardize 
the characters in them.  I don't bastardize the ones doing the MST'ing, I 
just make them feel sick, disgusted, and angry, and you get the idea.  Now 
just keep reading.

	The Ludicrous-Class starship, The Drunken Crack Whore, gently glided 
through the sea of stars that is Space.  Gently gliding was a bad choice of 
words as the ship had just been stolen and no hijacker in his or her right 
mind would flee from the scene simply gliding.
	The ship's new captain, Dargonis, sat at the bridge.  Dargonis's entire 
body (except for his eyes, mouth, and chin) was in a covering that could 
only be described as 'cool-looking, high tech armor.'  He checked the 
scanners.  Nothing was following him.  Good.  Now was the time for phase 2.  
All he needed were a few victims... err.. critics.  Dargonis activated the 
TDMSTP (Teleportation Device for MST Purposes).  Washu, everyone's favorite 
mad scientist, appeared out of thin air.  "Hey!  What's the big idea!?!"
"The MST of a sick lemon."  Washu groaned, but said nothing.  Next appeared 
Duo Maxwell, the least high strung of the Gundam pilots.  "It's another 
lemon, isn't it?"  Dargonis nodded.  Next came a tall guy who looked weird, 
at least to Dargonis's other 'guests.'  Maybe it was because this guy didn't 
have the traditional large eyes and pointy nose of most anime characters.  
His eyes were gray and his hair red.  His non-anime appearance worried Duo 
and Washu, though they couldn't tell exactly why.  "Welcome, Rand Al'Thor."
"What is this place?  Why am I here?"
"It takes too long to explain, you'll find out as we go along."  Dargonis 
turned to face everyone.  "I have summoned you all here to   strike fear 
into the hearts of all those who dare write lemons.  Our first target is a 
rather sick lemon called 'Cooking Lessons.'  We   begin in 2 minutes!"

	Dargonis's note: If you're familiar with the Wheel of Time series (at least 
half-way through the second book) you don't have to bother with the next 
paragraph.

	Duo and Washu were very worried.  This Rand guy was completely alien to 
them.  Even when a MST Host brought some friend with him/her they never 
seemed as alien as this guy.  After a moment they built up enough courage to 
speak to Dargonis.  "Who is that guy?  Why doesn't he look familiar at all?" 
  Asked Duo.  Dargonis took a deep breath for the long-winded explanation to 
come.  "Rand is from a series of American novels rather than 1 of the myriad 
worlds of anime.  It's called the Wheel of Time.  Whereas you 2 don't change 
much during your respective series, Rand goes through significant changes in 
each book.  This is Rand as of the end of the second book.  He is the Dragon 
Reborn, which means he's the savior of his world but will also completely 
change the face of the world in the process.  His power stems from the One 
True Source's (akin to the Force) male half, Saidin.  It basically gives him 
power over the elements and other powers he doesn't know how to use yet.  
Since he's the Dragon Reborn the amount of power he can draw from Saidin is 
extremely high.  Because it was corrupted 3000 years before his time that 
power will drive him insane and make him rot away while still alive.  Deep 
down inside he realizes he's the Dragon Reborn but refuses to accept it.  
Since he is a farm boy (at least raised one) from a very different world he 
will use phrases like 'Light burn me' or 'flaming' to replace stuff like 
shit and damn.  Got it?"  Duo and Washu nodded.  "Good, then lets get 
going!"

The sun shone with a passion on the idyllic grounds of the Jurai Embassy on
Earth. Known for generations simply as the 'Masaki Shrine', the lush forests 
on
the mountains surrounding the former Demon's Prison were now part of the 
first
alien embassy on Earth.

[Washu] "A little too chaotic for an embassy.  More like Hell hole!"
[Duo] "Then why'd you live there?"
[Washu] "Eh, nothing better to do at the time."
[Darg] "Wait a second!  I thought Hoboken was the first alien embassy on 
Earth!  No wait, it's the first alien COLONY on Earth."

On one particular idyllic spot, the forest gave away to a calm lake and a 
wooden
house. In perfect harmony an alien onsen floated above the lake, in silent
defiance of gravity.

[Rand] "If it's in defiance why is there perfect harmony?"
[Duo] "Because the author says so."

The house itself was a spacious 3-storey piece of art in wood and glass. 
While
certainly not small, the abode was certainly humble in size, considering it 
was
the First Crown Prince of Jurai's residence on Earth. In fact, said Prince's
treeship - the Achika - was an order of magnitude larger then the building.

[Rand] "Who?"
[Washu] (sarcastically) "First Prince of Jurai, gee I wonder who it could 
be..."

Inside the house could be found a large shiny Earth-style kitchen, where two 
of
the female residents were engaged in casual conversation. Both were clad in
robes looking like expensive kimonos, but modified in the traditional style 
of
the Royal House of Jurai.

[Duo] "This isn't a Sasami lemon, is it?"
[Darg] "Sorta."
[Everyone shudders but Rand looks confused.]

The first of the females had blue patterns in her robes, matching the long,
flowing blue hair perfectly. Her pink eyes seemed to instill tranquility in 
the
souls of any observer, but a slight hint of mischief - a reminder of her 
youth -
was present to the trained eye. On her forehead two circular blue dots

[Duo] "Uh oh, it's Sasami!"

complimented her soft features. The two dots were traditional for the first 
wife
of the Emperor, symbolizing the megami marks of power on the patron goddess 
of
Jurai. As the first wife of the Crown Prince, the marks suited the female
perfectly. However these two dots in particular was not make-up, but rather 
the
original megami-marks identifying Tsunami.

[Rand] "No it isn't, it's Tsunami."
[Washu] "Er.. they are the same person."
[Rand looks confused.]

The second of the females was clad similarly, but had red patterns in her 
robe
where her counterpart had blue. Instead of flowing, her hair was a wild mane 
of
untamable cyan locks reaching to her knees. Set in the style of her 
mother's,
her hair added to the slightly feline aura surrounding her - further 
accented by
the golden cat-like eyes. Three red dots in a triangular pattern completed 
the
sharper features of her face. Like her counterpart, these marks too were 
genuine
megami power marks, beeing those identifying the neko-goddess Ryoko.

[Washu] "No!  Not my Ryoko!"
[Darg] "What's neko mean?"
[Duo] "You summoned us without knowing Japanese!?!"
[Darg] "I know some..."
[Duo] "...... baka!"
[Darg] "Hey!"
[Rand] "Who's Ryoko?"
[Wasu] "My daughter."
[Rand looks more confused.]

Currently, the first wife of the Crown Prince was tutoring the second wife 
in
the culinary arts of Earth, a concept which had horribly eluded Ryoko's 
grasp in
the past. Considering that she spent her first 5 millenia as a destroyer of
worlds, this is not really a surprise. However under the skilled tutelage of 
her
sensei Tsunami, her skills had improved incredibly.

[Darg] "Now she can make toast!"

This particular day saw Tsunami lecturing Ryoko on the western-style salad. 
On
the table in front of them were various ingredients neatly ordered; 
tomatoes,
iceberg, cucumbers, carrots, salad-oil and a few alien ingredients.

[Darg] "Sounds kinky!"
[Washu slaps Darg.]
[Rand] continues to look confused.
[Duo] "If this is Western style salad why are there alien ingredients?"

--- * ---

[Duo] "Look!  It's a belt with a detached buckle!"

"Ryoko-chan..are you paying attention?"

[Washu] "Does she ever?"

Tsunami had interrupted her praise of the natural ingredients in Terran food
when it was apparent that Ryoko had zoned out.

[Duo] "Must have been all those drugs."

"Earth control to Ryoko! Wake up!"

[Washu] "What would Earth control care about Ryoko?  Shouldn't it be Jurain 
control?"

Tsunami raised her voice a bit, breaking Ryoko out of her reverie.

"huh?.. what?"

[Darg] "Yep, definitely drugs."

"You really miss him, ne Ryoko-chan?"

[Rand] "Are they referring to Tenchi or whoever gave them drugs?"

Ryoko followed Tsunami's gaze to her own hands, where she was idly playing 
with
one of the cucumbers in a suggestive manner. She blushed a bit.

[Rand shudders.]

"Hey..you miss him too. You're just better at hiding it."

"Hmm?"

"Don't play innocent with me - I can smell your pheremones. 

[Darg] (Ryoko) "And your pheromones don't smell too good either!  When was 
the last time you took a bath?"

If he came

[Washu] "If he came!?!  I'm not even sure Tenchi is CAPABLE of that!"

home now
you'd probably do the ecchi with him before he makes it through the living
room." Ryoko added with a playful smile.

[Darg raises eyebrow.]
[Washu slaps Darg.]
[Rand] "What's ecchi?"
[Duo whispers in Rand's ear.]
[Rand] "That's disgusting!"
[Darg] "That's only the start!"

"Only if you don't exhaust him before he makes it to the living room." 
Tsunami
added in a mock defensive statement.

"So very true."

[Duo] "Hmm... that sounds a little out of character for Tsunami, with or 
without Sasami's influence.  As for Ryoko..."

"Well, he might arrive today. But until he does, why don't we pass some time
finishing this salad.

[Washu] "Why do I get the feeling it's not the salad they'll be working on?"

Ryoko was about to suggest an alternate way of passing some time, but 
decided
against it. Even if that way would have provided some relief. As she 
considered
this, Tsunami continued the interrupted cooking session.

[Darg] "Well it's good to know Ryoko is still in character, though not by 
much."
[Washu] "So far..."

"As for the tomatoes, it is important that they are ..."

Ryoko's thoughts began wandering again. Subconciously her fingers stroked 
the
cucumber she never did put down, as her thoughts ran to Tenchi again. Even 
if
the marriage was two months ago, one week was still alot of time to be 
without
him.

[Darg] "What did Ayeka say about it?"
[Duo] "She fell into a plot hole and was never seen again."
[Washu] "And where am I in this?"
[Darg] "MTS'ing it."
[Duo] "At least it doesn't have Mihoshi."
[Everyone nods in agreement except Rand who looks more and more puzzled by 
the minute.]

Tsunami noticed that Ryoko had zoned out again. While she herself had 
greater
patience, she missed Tenchi no less. And like Ryoko, she too had some 
stirring
urges which had grown stronger as the week passed. Looking at Ryoko's hands 
she
guessed that Ryoko probably wouldn't be able to concentrate until Tenchi
returned.
Unless, of course, Ryoko found some relief.
[Duo] "Looks like things are going downhill."
[Rand] "I don't understand."
[Washu slams a helmet on Rand's head.  Light bulbs on it flash.  Rand 
realizes what's going on.  He looks very worried.]

A sparkle of mischief in her eyes, Tsunami grabbed one of the bottles of 
salad
oil. Squeezing it, she splashed Ryoko with a streak of oil down the front of 
her
dress.

[Washu] "I don't remember Sasami being mischievous, Tsunami even less."
[Duo] "It's called an Out of Character Experience."

This woke Ryoko up. With a startled "Hey!" she grabbed the other bottle and
squirted at Tsunami. Tsunami retaliated, and soon the two goddesses were 
running
around the table in the center of the kitchen, splashing salad oil at each
other.

[Rand] "Are they *sure* it was salad oil?"
[Everyone gives Rand a weird look.  Rand sinks back in his seat.]

After a while they stopped to catch their breath, both now clad in 
exceedingly
sticky clothes. Tsunami more so, since Ryoko managed to pour half a bottle 
down
her backside with a doppelganger.

[Rand] "Eeeewwwwww...."

Noticing Tsunami assessing the amount of oil on her clothes, Ryoko offered 
her
help with a sly smile.

[Duo] "Where'd the smile come from?"
[Darg] "They left the door open again, sheesh.  Now there are animals and 
smiles running all over the house!"

"Here, let me help you with that, Tsunami-chan." Ryoko said and placed her 
hand
on Tsunami's shoulder.

[Everyone] "Uh oh..."

Tsunami eep'ed shortly when Ryoko placed her out of phase with her clothes,

[Rand] "Who dropped whose clothes?"

dropping them all to the ground. Incidentally, this also placed Ryoko out of
phase with her own clothing, which dropped synchronously with Tsunami's.

[Darg] "I thought Ryoko already phased out of her clothes."

Standing naked in front of each other, neither failed to notice how the room
temperature seemed to have gone up a few degrees, or how the other's nipples
were slightly swollen from excitement.

[Washu] "Damn global warming!"
[Duo] "Then the polar ice caps melt enough to wash away Tenchi's house, 
killing everyone and ending the lemon!"
[Everyone] "YAY!"

Discovering that Ryoko's bottle of salad oil was empty, Tsunami got back at
Ryoko by splashing her. Tsunami smiled when Ryoko brought her own bottle up 
to
get even, only to discover that it was empty.

[Duo] "It pays to have a bottle twice the size of the other."

"Gotcha"

Ryoko smiled back as she got an idea. Tsunami's superior smile was replaced 
by
confusion when Ryoko started smiling, as she wondered how Ryoko was going to 
get
her back without more 'ammunition'. The answer soon came, as Ryoko discarded 
her
empty bottle and glomped Tsunami amazon-style, smearing Tsunami with the oil 
she
had just splashed Ryoko with.

[Darg raises an eyebrow.  Washu slaps him.  Rand gasps.]

In addition to rubbing oil on Tsunami, the glomp had some interesting side
effects, as it caused their ample breasts to rub against each other. After a 
few
seconds of contact both moaned slightly.

[Washu] "I don't want to see this!"

Reclaiming the initiative, Tsunami brought Ryoko's head up for a kiss while
lowering her onto the table at the center of the kitchen. Soon after they 
were
french-kissing, rubbing their bodies against each other.

[Rand] "Light burn me... never would I ever imagine ANYTHING like this!"
[Duo] "I think extra light is one of the LAST thing's you'd want in there!"
[Darg] "This is just the beginning."
[Everyone groans.]

After a while of this Tsunami broke contact, sitting on her knees with a leg 
on
each side of Ryoko's hips. Taking the remaining bottle, she added a trace of 
oil
from Ryoko's neck to her thighs. Proptly she began to massage it into 
Ryoko's
skin, her hands roaming over Ryoko's body; playing with her breast; circling 
the
gem at her throat. The oil on the table from their 'fight' stuck to Ryoko as 
she
squirmed under Tsunami's pleasuring touch.

[Washu] "More detail then I wanted!"
[Darg and Duo] "Huhuhuhuhu."
[Rand doesn't feel well.]

Soon Ryoko was covered in the slippery oil, her body glistening in the 
sunlight
from the windows. She gently reversed positions with Tsunami, and started
applying oil to her willing body. Rubbing the oil all over her, Ryoko soon 
had
Tsunami glistening in the same way as herself. She shifted slightly in her
position, bringing her pelvis into contact with Tsunami's. They rubbed 
against
each other, their moans increasing as the pleasure brought them closer.

[Darg and Duo grin.  Washu slaps both of them.]
[Washu] "The author has to be a guy!  No woman would ever think up anything 
REMOTELY like this!  What is it with guys and lesbianism!?!"
[Darg] "Err… the same thing with girls and gay guys!"
[Washu] "WHAT!?!"
[Rand] "Hey! I'm not enjoying this!"
[Darg] "Yeah right!  You're just trying to hide it!"

Laying back on top of Tsunami, they started rubbing their oil-coated bodies
against each other. Bringing her hands down, Tsunami started playing with
Ryoko's clit. Ryoko shuddered against Tsunami's body as a wave of pleasure 
ran
through her, and soon she brought her own hands down to repay the favour.

[Rand gets sick.]
[Darg] "Oh come on!  The Dragon Reborn has to have a stronger stomach!"
[Rand] "I AM NOT THE DRAGON REBORN!"
[Everyone gives Rand a weird look.]

Deciding to up the ante, Ryoko turned around bringing them to a 69. Adding 
her
tongue to the job, Ryoko had Tsunami moaning and squirming under her. 
Tsunami
levelled the field by applying her own tongue, and started easing a finger 
into
Ryoko soon after.

[Washu sits completely paralyzed with fear and disgust.]

Ryoko's breath quickened as Tsunami applied another finger to the one 
already in
Ryoko. She felt the tension rising as an orgasm built within her, and in a 
last
ditch effort to bring Tsunami with her over the edge, she slid two of her 
own
fingers into Tsunami.

[Rand throws up.]
[Darg] "... wimp."
[Rand glares at Darg.  The ship shakes and sparks fly all around it.]
[Rand] "Don't make me do what I don't want to..."
[Darg] "Then don't do it to begin with!"

Tsunami was almost swept away by a wave of pleasure as Ryoko did her best to
finish her off. Almost lost in pleasure she managed to quicken the pace

[Duo] (Shao Kahn) "SEXUALITY!"

at which
she was finger-fucking Ryoko. This proved to be enough, and Ryoko cried out 
as a
mind-shattering orgasm blew away her mind. However the squirming of Ryoko's

[Duo] "Who would think a mind blowing orgasm would blow away someone's 
mind?"
[Dargonis's additional note:  I said oxymoronic comments are fun!]

oil-coated body against her's, brought Tsunami over the edge as well. She 
added
her own cry of ecstasy as she was taken to the Clouds and the Rain.

[Duo] (Shao Kahn) "TRIPLE SEXUALITY!"
[Rand] "How can anyone even imagine anything like this?"
[Darg] "You have too much faith in Humanity."
[Rand] "And what are the 'Clouds and the Rain?'"
[Darg] "You really don't want to know."

After a minute the duet died down to quiet moans, as their bodies relaxed. 
Ryoko
slid off Tsunami and turned around to face her. Laying down at her side, 
Ryoko
brought Tsunami in for a kiss. They alternated initiating short kisses. 
Tsunami
quickly noted the growing urgency in Ryoko's kisses, and her hands roaming
Tsunami's still glistening body.

"Still horny Ryoko-chan?"

[Washu] "Was she ever not?"
[Rand throws up again.]

Ryoko's steamy gaze was all the answer she needed.

"You're quite the sex-kitten. I think I know just what to do about that."

[Rand] "Sex... kitten?"

The mischievous glint was back in Tsunami's eyes as she slid down the

[Duo] "Yep.  It's still Sasami.  Out of character Sasami, but Sasami none 
the less."
[Everyone shudders.]

table
until her head was resting at Ryoko's thigh. With one hand she grabbed the
bottle of salad oil and poured some over Ryoko's pussy and her other hand
playing with it. When Ryoko's privates were covered in a slick layer of oil 
she
grabbed a cucumber with her empty hand and began rubbing it against Ryoko's 
clit
and pussy-lips. Applying a bit more oil, the cucumber was soon coated, and 
Ryoko
was moaning loudly at the sensations from the cucumber rubbing her
unmentionables.

[Washu] "At least it's not that one in the Carrot Patch."
[Everyone shudders.  Rand looks confused.]

Slowly Tsunami let the tip of the cucumber slip inside Ryoko's hole, already
lubricated by love juices. Ryoko shivered at the contact, and Tsunami 
brought
the tip outside again only to slowly ease it back. She continued teasing 
Ryoko
in this manner until she managed a "Please..st-stop teasing m-me...I..I need 
it
...n-now".

[Darg] "Sounds like she needs insulin."
[Duo] "Or drugs."

Complying with Ryoko's wish, Tsunami slid the cucumber into her waiting 
pussy.
Ryoko cried out Tsunami's name as she felt the immense pleasure of the 
cucumber
sliding deep into her. Tsunami brought it back out, until only the tip was
inside, then pressed it back in. Continuing to slowly push the cucumber in 
and
out of Ryoko, Tsunami started licking her clit. Ryoko's body shuddered and
writhened with pleasure, sliding around the oil-covered table. Each time it 
went
in, a little bit more of the cucumber would be submerged in Ryoko's dripping
pussy.

[Everyone gets sick.]
[Washu] "I'll never eat cucumbers again!"
[Rand] "What's a cucumber?"
[Duo] "You don't know what it is?  What do you eat anyway!?!"
[Rand] "...... usually bread and cheese.  Or some nearby roots if I'm at 
camp."
[Everyone laughs at Rand.  The ship shakes again.]
[Darg] "Don't use Saidin here, Rand!"
[The ship stops shaking.]

Around the tenth stroke only the tip of the cucumber could be seen protuding
from Ryoko's glistening slit, and Ryoko was thrashing around on the table in
ecstasy. The sensation of the cucumber buried so deep in her body and 
Tsunami's
skilled tongue at work on her clit brought Ryoko over the edge and then 
some.

[Darg] "I think Ryoko is running out of space in there."

Her loud cries of pleasure echoed through the kitchen, loud enough to drown 
out
the landing of a treeship outside.

[Washu] "Who could *that* be?"
[Duo] "It's Santa!"

--- * ---

[Darg] "Is it just me or does this remind you of what's going on in this?"
[Washu] "DON'T START!"

First Crown Prince Tenchi Hakubi Jurai brought his treeship, the Achika, to

perfect standstill over the lake. The majestetic ship hovered in the same
gravity-defying manner as the onsen, like a sculptured wooden piece of art
suspended in time.

[Washu] "And then it blew up, killing everyone."
[Everyone waves flags and cheers.]

Tenchi gave a mental command with the Master Key, and Achika teleported him 
to
just outside the door of his house. He gave a quick loving thought to

his two
wives, who would surely tackle him in a group hug/glomp the minute he 
knocked
the door. He missed them a lot, and knew how much they missed him after even 
a
few days apart.

[Darg] "Where's Ayeka during all this?"
[Duo] "Still stuck in the plot hole."

Smiling he knocked the door, mentally bracing for impact. When nothing 
happened
his face changed to a more puzzled expression. It was hard to miss a 
spaceship

[Rand] "Or what was going on inside the house."

landing beside the house. Surely they must have heard him?
Knocking a second time, Tenchi recieved still no response.

[Duo] "Because they're dead!"
[Everyone cheers.]

He opened the door and stepped inside, still wondering where his wives were 
and
how they could not have heard him approach. He almost immediately got the
answer, in the form of a load cry of pleasure from the direction of the 
kitchen.
Before his brain had identified the source and nature of the sound, he had
turned his head in direction of the kitchen, and his eyes went wide.

[Rand] (Tenchi) "Aw... not again!"
[Darg] (also as Tenchi) "If only I knew they were lesbians *before* I 
married them!"
[Washu slaps Darg.  Darg pushed a button and Washu is trapped in a glass 
orb.]
[Darg] "Don't try anything on me in this ship I have an anti-deity field 
activated so don't even THINK of escape!"
[Darg lets loose and EVIL cackle.  Everyone else backs away.]

Tenchi had been through a lot of things in his life. Freeing demons,

age..."

avatars, discovering his heritage and dealing with goddesses. Still, nothing
could have prepared him for the sight his eyes met when he looked into the
kitchen.

[Darg] "It was a..."
[Duo] "Ayeka."
[Glass orb disappears and Washu falls out.]
[Washu] "A trans-dimensional Class M Subspace Rift!"
[Rand gives Washu a confused look.]
[Rand] "a trolloc!"
[Everyone but Darg gives Rand a weird look.]
[Darg] "Actually I was gonna say a baboon..."

The centre table of the kitchen was coated in salad oil, and covered

with the
patron goddesses of two worlds. These two incredibly curvy megami were

[Washu] "Since when was Ryoko a Goddess of a world?"
[Darg] "And didn't the Juraian Empire span several worlds?"

stark
naked and covered in oil themselves, glistening in the sunlight like a 
teenage
fantasy. The tree-goddess sat on her knees, bend over the neko-goddess, 
sliding
a cucumber deep into her naked slit. The cyan haired beauty was squirming on 
the
table, squeezing her glistening breasts with her hands. The blue haired 
beauty
had her firm oiled ass pointing into the air, her wet pussy directly in 
view.

[Washu] "I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!"
[Washu throws up behind couch, followed by Rand.]
[Rand gets even paler.]

By pure reflex Tenchi's hand went to his nose. Even if conditioned to the 
sight
of his sexy wives naked and getting naughty, his nose was hard pressed not 
to
erupt in a red geyser. Another part of him reacted as promptly, creating a 
tent
in his regal robes at his crotch.

[Duo] "Awww.. there isn't enough blood going to the nose for him to bleed to 
death!"

For a short while he was paralyzed by the sight of Tsunami working on 
Ryoko's
third orgasm while pointing her ass in the air in a most inviting fashion.

[Darg] "It had a invitation card on it?"
[Rand throws up again.]

Slowly regaining his wits, his attention turned to a piece of him which had
awakened from the sight and sounds in the kitchen. Soon Tenchi's hormones 
had
made the decision for him, and he moved stealthily into the kitchen,

[Washu] "That's a first."

disrobing
as he went.

[Darg] "Then he slipped on the oil and died."
[Everyone cheers.]

Silent like a ninja he crawled up on the table behind his oblivious first 
wife.
Now naked himself, he positioned the head of his throbbing erection on 
Tsunami's
coated pussy-lips. The gentle contact tickled his sensitive head, stiffening 
him
further. Then with a "Honey, I'm home" he slid his shaft deep inside 
Tsunami,
burying his length in her lubricated hole.

[Rand] "Urp!"
[Rand throws up.]
[Darg] "Come on!  The Dragon Reborn has to take more than this!"
[Rand] "I AM NOT THE DRAGON REBORN!"
[The ship shakes.  Rand is in a glass orb.]
[Darg] "Enough."

Tsunami cried out from pleasure as she felt the warm length of Tenchi's 
member
sliding into her. His remark lingered on the edge of her conciousness, as 
she
was lost in a wave of pleasure, but she already instinctively knew who it 
was.
Her concentration on pleasuring Ryoko was further broken when he started 
fucking
her, slowly increasing tempo.

[Washu] "Too much info!"

Ryoko was still oblivious to Tenchi's arrival, lost in the sensation of the
cucumber now completely buried in her. Tsunami was quicly approaching the 
edge
as Tenchis warm pole drove in and out of her. With each stroke he

[Duo] "Wouldn't using a pole be painful?"
[Darg] "Only if it Tenchi didn't find it in a plot hole."

brought his
erect manhood in to the root, his balls briefly touching her sensitive clit.
Already hot from their action, Tsunami could only take so much of this 
before
her mind was washed away. She cried out his name as the orgasm overtook her.

[Darg] "And then became a drooling vegetable.  The end."
[Everyone looks confused.]
[Darg] "Hey, her mind WAS being washed away!"

Ryoko's mind was caught by the sound of his name being cried in pleasure, 
and
she opened her eyes to see Tsunami collapsing on her, Tenchi standing behind 
her
with his dripping erection, and a warm smile on his face as he observed 
them.
Rolling around, Ryoko brought the exhausted Tsunami under her and got up on 
all
fours. She wiggled her ass invitingly at Tenchi.

[Everyone throws up.  Rand falls out of the glass orb.]

Tenchi saw Ryoko's shapely ass standing in front of his erection. The

[Darg] "Shaped like a square?"
[Duo] "No, a triangle."

tip of the
cucumber still buried in her was visible just inside her pussy, and her
unconciously summoned tail was making inviting gestures towards her vacant 
hole.
The low purr emanating from her throat as she looked back at him over her
shoulder with a seductive gaze completed her neko image.

[Darg] "I think I got an idea of what neko means..."
[Duo] "It's about time."
[Darg smacks Duo.]

Grabbing the half full bottle, Tenchi placed the bottleneck just inside her 
ass
and began pouring salad oil into her. Ryoko squirmed as the cold slippery 
liquid
flowed into her, slowly filling her other hole. When the bottle was spent,
Tenchi discarded it. He watched fascinated as excess oil flowed out her ass,
down her pussy around the protuding tip of the cucumber, dripping down on to
Tsunami's stomach.

[Everyone throws up.  Rand twice as much.]
[Darg] "WAY too much detail!"

Placing the tip of his cock between Ryoko's slippery ass cheeks, he slowly 
eased
himself inside her, pushing out oil from her full hole. Ryoko who had only 
just
attuned to the feeling of the cool oil filling her hole now felt the warmth 
of
Tenchi's erection working it's way into her. She cried out with pleasure as 
he
completed his first stroke, burying his dick completely in her ass. His 
balls
now between her ass-cheeks, could feel some of the remaining oil seeping 
out.

[More vomiting.]
[Rand] "Make it stop!"
[Darg] "I can't!  Once the doors close we're stuck until it's over!"
[Everyone glares and Darg and then get sick again.]

Tenchi slowly started thrusting in and out of Ryoko, her moans testament of 
the
pleasure he was giving her. His own mind was almost numb with the incredible
feeling of her tight warm lubricated canal engulfing his cock. Going steady,
their mutual pleasure rose as they both worked closer to orgasm.

[Rand continues throwing up.]

Recovering from her previous orgasm, Tsunami started massaging Ryoko's 
bouncing
breasts. Shifting position beneath Ryoko, Tsunami turned 180 so she had a 
clear
view of Tenchi's dick pounding into Ryoko's ass. With her left hand she 
started
rubbing Ryoko's clit, while her right hand started moving the cucumber 
around
inside Ryoko. In her position, head directly beneath Ryoko's ass and pussy, 
the
oil seeping from both holes would drip on her face, but Tsunami made no move 
to
change this. Soon her face has glistening from a thin coverage of oil and
juices, from her neck to past her megami marks.

[Washu] "Poor Sasami.  Different name, same lemon crap.  URP!"

Ryoko was already close when Tsunami resumed her attentions to the cucumber 
and
her clit. The sensation of having both her holes filled with thrusting poles

[Darg] "Where'd they get this second pole?"
[Duo] "Tsunami found it in the plot hole."

combined with the pleasure flowing from her clit brought her over the edge 
and
far beyond. As she shivered in the third orgasm that day, the fourth rolled 
over
her, sweeping her completely away.

[Darg] "Swept her away and out and into the plot hole, along with everyone 
else."
[Rand] "Thus ending this horror."
[Everyone cheers.]

As Ryoko came, her muscles contracted around Tenchi's erection. The pleasure
overwhelmed Tenchi, taking him over the edge as well. Thrusting deep into 
the
writhening Ryoko, Tenchi shot his first hot load in the depth of her ass. At
this point Ryoko collapsed on top of Tsunami, her body still convulsing in a
mindblowing orgasm. Tenchi's cock now out in the open shot another glob of
sticky white semen into the air. It landed on Ryoko's ass drawing a trail 
down
her slit and finally onto Tsunami's left cheek. Aiming downwards, his third 
shot
splashed against Tsunami's forehead, covering her marks in his hot liquid.

[Everyone throws up.]
[Washu] "Too much, too much...."

Tsunami felt the hot sticky fluid running down her face as more streaks were
added to her cheeks, nose and forehead. Reflexively she closed her left eye 
when
she saw another load spewing fourth in that direction, and soon after she 
felt
the hot semen pooling on her eyelid, parts of it running down her temple. 
Yet
another load landed on her lips and tongue. As the white liquid settled on 
her
tongue, she noticed the familiar salty flavour of the hot glob in her mouth.

[Duo] "STOP!  WE CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS!"
[Everyone gets very sick.  Rand's already throwing up again.]

Another two shots flew into her mouth, adding to the sticky pool gathering
there. She felt the heat of his slowly relaxing rod resting against her 
coated
forehead, and closed her mouth. Relaxing from the ordeal she swallowed the 
warm
salty load in her mouth with a contended sigh.

[Everyone tries to throw up only to find they already emptied their 
stomachs... several times.]

Tenchi looked down, the fog of pleasure slowly lifting from his vision.

[Rand] "Does this mean we won't see any more?"
[Washu] "Shame it doesn't work that way."

In front
of him was the two goddesses, hist first and second wives, covered in a

[Duo] "Just wait till Hist finds out what Tenchi did with his wives."

glistening slippery layer of salad oil. The neko-goddess was sprawled on top 
of
the tree-goddess, a combination of sperm and oil leaking from her ass, 
covering
the tip of the cucumber visible in her slit. The patron goddess of Jurai was
covered in a mix of semen and oil from the base of her neck to her forehead
where his relaxing dick rested, covering the megami-marks with the last seed
oozing out of it. Her eyes were closed in contentment, allowing a pool of 
his
semen to to rest on her left eyelid. Her throat bulging as she swallowed the
load which had gathered in her mouth. The only sounds breaking the 
tranquility
were a satisfied sigh from Tsunami and a low purr from Ryoko.

[Everyone] "TOO MUCH DETAIL!!!"
[Rand throws up again, although it's pure stomach acid at this point.]
[Darg] "It's almost over!"
[Everyone is too sick to cheer.]

A little while later Tenchi finally broke the silence.

[Duo] "By killing himself."

"Well, if this is what those tutoring sessions in cooking is about, you can 
sign
me up for some lessons anytime."

[Darg] "AHAHAHA.. no."

[Everyone] "YEY!  NO MORE!"

Another out of context lemon from me.

[Everyone] "NOOO!!!"

This story breaks with two of my main principles regarding Tenchi Muyo fics:

[Washu] "A lemon author with principles?  Who would have thought?"

1) It has Tenchi married to Tsunami
2) It has Tenchi married to more than one girl

[Rand] "It broke more principles than I knew existed."
[Washu] "Quiet, the author is making the  
'last-minute-attempt-to-save-his-ass.'

But since this is a lemon with no story and no plot, I will let it slide for
now.

[Washu] "Slide... worst choice of wording."
[Washu and Rand shudder.]

I have chosen to call the Sasami/Tsunami personality by her goddess name to
emphasize that this is not a Sasami-lemon.

[Washu] "YES IT IS!  YOU JUST USED THE OTHER NAME!"

Tenchi's treeship is named Achika after his mother, just as Yosho's treeship 
is
named after his mother (Funaho).

[Duo] "... how creative."
[Darg] "You mean like going from Deathscythe, to Deathsycthe Hell, to 
Deathscythe Hell Custom?"
[Duo] "You're a cruel one, aren't you?"
[Darg] "Took you long enough."

Comments, criticism and suggestions are always welcome.
Unless everybody flames me, you'll probably see more fics like this. I

plans for at least two Universe fics, one with the Dimension Tuner, and a
crossover of some sort.

Hope you liked it.

[Everyone] "NO!"

Ecchi Half

			>>>>> DEACTIVATING FANFIC, PLEASE WAIT <<<<<

[Rand] "This Ecchi Half is worse than the Dark One himself!"
[Duo] "Who?"
[Rand] "The Dark One, the Lord of Lies, the Prince of Darkness, Ba'alzamon, 
Heartsbane..."
[Darg] (continuing for Rand) "… Bill Gates, The Great Lemon Writer, Barbara 
Streisan…"
[Duo] "We get the idea."
[Washu] "I'd like to perform some 'tests' on this guy."
[Darg] "Don't you mean torture?"
[Washu] "Yep."
[Doors open up.  Everyone rushes out of the room.]


			Back on the Bridge

[Darg] "So, what did you guys think?"
[Duo] "It didn't have too many spelling errors.  Most of them weren't so big 
anyway."
[Washu] "Good writing style but bad, BAAAD contents."
[Rand doesn't speak.  He just curls up in the corner and shakes violently.]
[Darg] "Ok.  You guys are done for now.  You can each go back to your 
respective worlds.... until I need your assistance again."
Everyone gives Darg dirty looks until he hits the TDMSTP and they all 
disappear.  Dargonis goes to the control panel, sets a new ship coarse, and 
looks into the TMFFA Lemon section.  "How many more to come?  How many 
more...." he mused to himself.


			Dargonis's comments

	Well, if you're reading this you have either gone through my entire MST or 
just scrolled to the bottom.  I hope it wasn't the latter.  First off I hope 
you enjoyed my first MST.  Any comments, whether of good or ill nature, will 
be appreciated.  Let it also be known that I have no intention to start 
feuds with these lemon writers.  I realize that you (the lemon writer) are 
simply using creative license, no matter how offensive.  In that sense I am 
also using creative license.  I guess all I am trying to say is don't go too 
far with your lemons.  Though I am not opposed to the concept of lemons you 
should know your limits.
	On a lighter note, goodbye and good luck!  I'll see you next time I write 
an MST or make my own story (yeah right!), or rather, you'll see me and I 
still won't know you.  Well, you get the idea.
	Oh yeah, if those of you who know who Rand Al'Thor is, you're probably 
wondering why I decided to use his character as of the end of the second 
book.  The answer is very simple.  You probably guessed it already.  If not 
then well, you didn't.  I've just started on the third book so I wanted to 
use Rand's personality at a point I'm familiar with.  In the next MST 
(whenever that is) I'll have a more 'updated' version of Rand.  Will I ever 
have Rand as he is at the (current) end of the series?  Doubtful.  I don't 
have enough free time to finish up the other books THAT quickly.  If you're 
upset because I broke the unspoken rule of using ONLY anime characters 
(aside from myself and/or any irl friends of mine, and assuming that rule 
exists) then TOO BAD!  If you don't like it then write your own MST of my 
MST or something creative and cruel like that!
