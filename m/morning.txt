Tenchi Muyo:  Morning!

==========

Morning.

        On a quiet Sunday morning, Sasami is still asleep.  Since she is
usually the first one up, Misa is starting to wonder.  But, she has a
few tricks up her sleeve.  <I used to play pranks on everyone else.
Should I pull one on 'myself?'  Looking to the cabbit on her shoulder,
she whispers, "Ryo?"

        Ryo jumps to the floor, and walks softly over to the slumbering
princess.  Hopping on to her stomach, she looks to confirm Sasami is
indeed sleeping.  Turning around, she puts her puffball tail just short
of touching her nose.  Giving it a couple swings, she watches for
results.

        Sasami however, just turns to her side, avoiding it.

        Ryo, thrown to the floor, moves over to her feet.  Rubbing her head
against the arch of the foot, she hopes to hit that one ticklish spot.

        However, Sasami just bends her knee, bringing the foot away.

        Ryo, curious, wonders if Sasami is indeed awake.  Walking to her face,
she sees no sign of alertness.  Stumped, Ryo, can't think of anything
else.  "Meow?"

        <Ryo!> Misa says to her through the link.  <Come here a second.>

        The cabbit runs to Misa's feet, and waits for instruction.  However,
Misa says nothing.  <Sorry about this.>  Moving her foot, she steps on
Ryo's.

        "MMMMEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!!!!" Ryo howls.  The scream sends Sasami nearly to
the ceiling.  Not only that, it also wakes up Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko,
Washu (in her lab), and Yosho (at the shrine).

        "R-Ryo?" Sasami stutters, trying to slow her heart rate.

        "Good Morning, Sasami!"  Misa shouts.
