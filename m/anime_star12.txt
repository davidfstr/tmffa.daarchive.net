Besides Jay Magnus and the Anime Star, nothing used in this story is my
property. I'm not paying to use the characters, nor making money from them.
Amazingly, I am the author of both stories.

Anime Star MSTs #12
By: Turbo Magnus

They say that when the pacifist gets mad, the smart get the hell out of
there. Jay Magnus's only problem was that there was nowhere to run from his
angry fiancé, Relena Darlien, "We're MSTing a fic written by WHOM?!"

"Er... by me."

"And just WHY are we the only two MSTing it?"

"It's actually more of a revue than a MST..."

"DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT!"

"I JUST WANTED TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU WITHOUT CROW'S SPYING OR ZEALL
SENDING A FIC OR ANYTHING! IF THAT BOTHERS YOU, I'LL ASK LEENA!"

Never let it be said that jealousy, even that which isn't true jealousy but
just protecting your interests didn't help someone. Before the alarm had a
chance to sound, Relena had dragged Jay into the theater.

[Fic begins]

HOAG(PR): Just to remind the two of you, I'll still be up here monitoring.
RELENA: Hoag, please do so with the video feed OFF.

I don't own the Ryu-oh, Aeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, or the song Seven Spanish
Angels.

JAY: It was preformed by Willie Nelson and Roy Orbison.

Nor am I getting any money as a result of this fic. The End takes place in
an alternate continuality of the OAV, so disregard the entire series after
the first episode.

RELENA: Sounds like the disclaimer for Jealousy.
JAY: Ksa did that one.
RELENA: Has that ever stopped this team before?
JAY: No.

The End

JAY: Or just maybe, the beginning.

By Turbo Magnus

RELENA: Turbo?
JAY: Yeah, that's who I write as.

Two years had passed since Misaki Tenchi had released the demon Ryoko from
her cave prison. Two years of love and joy after their initial fight. One
year since their marriage.

JAY: Looking at it like this, that sounds like a list of things to do today.

RELENA: Next on your's had best be ‘Give my girl a kiss', Buster.
JAY: Normally I have an aversion to orders, but in this case... Yes, Ma'am.
*Jay and Relena share a passionate kiss.*
HOAG(PR): Ahem. *They're still kissing.* A-Hem. *Still at it.* AHEM! *They
finally break apart.*
RELENA: What?
HOAG(PR): Remember, the MST?
JAY(Hawkeye): "Of course, how could I forget? It was in all the papers."

But one day, everything changed. One day a fleet of Jurian treeships, led by
the Ryu-oh and Princess Aeka, the fleet attacked Ryoko and Tenchi.

RELENA: As Scimitar would say "Department of Redundancy Department."
JAY: Hey, I was working on three things at the time. I bet the other works,
one of which is the record of MST #11 for the record, have mistakes too.

In their final moments their thoughts turned to a song they had once heard
and how ironic it was that they were living that song.

JAY: Okay, but why the Sailor Moon theme?
RELENA: Don't you take anything serious?
JAY: Besides me loving you?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko looked at Tenchi with a combination of fear and love in her eyes,
"This might be it, Ten-chan."

JAY: When did Tenchi fall in Nyannichuan?

Tenchi took Ryoko in his arms and held her tight, "As long as we're
together, it's never it."

RELENA: That was officially sappy.

~He looked down into the brown eyes
And said, "Say a prayer for me."
And she threw her arms around him,
Whispered, "God will keep us free."

RELENA: That's the song we did a duet of, isn't it?
JAY: Hai, Relena-Chan.

The Ryu-oh itself closed in on the two, it's weapons charging.

HOAG(PR): Not the best writing, eh mate?
JAY: Ne, button your hole!

~They could hear the riders coming.
He said, "This is my last fight.
If they take me back to Texas,
They won't take me back alive."

Ryoko took one last look at Tenchi, "I love you..."

JAY: "Let me help" is actually considered more important.

With those last words she flew into the air to face Aeka, by herself. No
matter what happened next, she would die before she would let Tenchi.

RELENA: Marry that flat-chested princess.
*A bunch of logs appear*
AEKA(Voice over): Speak for yourself, Peacecraft.
*Logs begin charging.*
JAY: Aeka, you do and I'll write a fic where you DO marry Serio.
*The logs stop charging and disappear*
JAY: Not that I might not anyway, ^_^
KZAKAKAKAKAKAKA!!!!
JAY(Crispy-critter, Hamtaro): Cush, cush.

~There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun.
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home.

~She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand.

RELENA(Girl): Put out that cigar, Mr. Gun!

Tenchi's hand brushed across Ryoko's face, closing her eye

JAY: So she's a cyclops now?

for the last time. Tears of loss and sadness dripped down onto her face.

~She said, "Father, please forgive me.
I can't make it without my man."

Ryoko was dead, and with her died Tenchi's reason for living. Without a word
he withdrew the Tenchi-Ken,

RELENA: Sword of Heaven and Earth.

ignited it, and charged at the ship that had taken the woman he loved from
him.

JAY: Run to your doom!

~And she knew the gun was empty,
And she knew she couldn't win,

JAY: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how many of the other side falls
with you.

To tell the truth, Tenchi didn't care if he lived or died.

RELENA: He is now, for once, dangerous.
JAY: A man with nothing to lose.

It didn't matter, nothing mattered anymore. Ryoko was dead and for all he
cared, the world could burn.

JAY(Inferno): Buuuuurn for the royalty! *Begins charging a Fire 4 spell*
RELENA: No Fire spells!
JAY: Poo, and I don't mean Winnie The. *Extinguishes spell.*

~But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again.

Only feet away from the Ryu-oh, Tenchi was cut down in a blaze.

RELENA: What did I say about fire spells?
JAY: IT WASN'T ME!

As he died, the song played in his mind...

JAY: Metallica's Unforgiven? Weird, but fitting.

~There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun.
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home.

Why did I write this?

RELENA: Knowing you, just to spend time with me.
JAY: I'm not going to respond.

Honestly I have no idea. It's just been brewing in my mind for (literally) a
couple years now, so I finally put finger to key and typed it out. Anyone
can MST this as long as I am informed, you won't need to ask my approval.
Comments, Criticism, etc to turbomagnus@excite.com In fact, I think that
since Chewy had so many comments I'll see if he'll MST it. ^_^

RELENA: Incentive to be silent.

[Fic ends]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOAG(PR): Well?
JAY: Biased.
RELENA: Good, for a work by a dumb dragon.
JAY: HEY, I resemble that remark!
RELENA: Only when fully Zeojin.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jay was pulling night shift again when he was again visited by the being of
light, "Soon the time will come when to protect all, you must do that which
you most fear."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do believe I am the first person to MST their own fic without it being a
MST of a MST or an Instant MST. I feel almost as proud as I did when I heard
Gato's words to the pilot of GP-01. What? Different Zeon doesn't mean
different ideals. Blah, Yakkity, yada, and smackity to
turbomagnus@excite.com.
