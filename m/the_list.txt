THE LIST

DISCLAIMER: I don't own the characters in this story, they are the 
property of Pioneer And AIC. What was I going to say? Oh that's 
right.... I wrote this purely for fun, so don't sue me. Anyway, 
Suing me is futile...I have no money anyway! By the way, the situation 
conveyed in this story is my own though.

THE LIST
By Lesell Charis


Tenchi sighed, gazing out the window wistfully. The rain poured down,
each raindrop like a little kamikaze pilot, screaming to the deities 
as it smacked against the glass and sunk down towards the cold earth. 
The harsh wind blew mockingly and Tenchi sighed again as he gazed at 
the list in front of him. He read the words carefully:

1) Practice with Grandpa

Subconsciously, he rubbed the sore spot on his head, where Katsuhito
 had rendered more of his brain cells useless. He'd been distracted 
by Ryoko and Ayeka, who were watching him practice today. Then, all 
he could remember was a grim face and the words:

"Hello"

Then the pain, as it went dark.

They had revived him of course, but his pride was hurt-being beaten so 
easily. All in front of Ryoko and Ayeka... too. He felt himself blush,
 thinking of the humiliation. Grabbing a nearby pencil he placed a 
tick near the words and moved on to the second thing on the list:

2) Do homework

He sighed now-- the headache he had was due to the double algebra 
equations he had spent the last hour trying desperately to understand.
 Washu finally intervened, and now he understood the problem, however 
the headache was still there. Most probably because of the cryptic 
words she had called out over her shoulder as she disappeared back 
into her lab;

"You owe me Tenchi....You owe me a *big* favor!" 

He cringed as he recalled the cackle that had rung through the air at 
that moment. He shuddered at the mere *thought* of what those words 
could possibly mean. 

He drew in a breath and sighed again. Overall, he was having a VERY bad 
day. He ticked the second item on the list furiously, and then moved 
onto the third and fourth.

3)    Clean Room

4) Choose between Ayeka and Ryoko.

Easier said than done.....He contemplated the list for a moment. 
What was he thinking?! He really didn't have what it took. He grabbed
 the pencil again and placed long lines on the paper.

There, it was done...he chuckled to himself

God knew he was never going to clean his room.

AUTHORS NOTES: I know what you're thinking, "What the hell type of 
fic is that!?" heh heh, if you are thinking that that means my work 
here is done! At least it was short though!  I guess that would pass 
as a SPAMfic.....then again, I'm pretty new to all this, so I don't 
really know.  

This was written in a five  minute epic of pure inspiration....or 
boredom....or both.  I was contemplating the fact that choosing between 
Ayeka and Ryoko was really difficult for Tenchi...then I started 
wondering, what if he shrugged it off really easily, like an item 
on a list? 

Actually, I basically just started with the "Kamikaze raindrops (tm)" 
line  and went on from there. By the way, Let me state, here and 
now that "Kamikaze raindrops (tm)" were invented by me, 'kay? 

'kay then, you know the drill-comments, criticism, abuse.....write
