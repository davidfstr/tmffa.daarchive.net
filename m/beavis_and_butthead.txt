Beavis and Butthead
From: "Happosai" <happosai@jps.net>


You know, if I wasn't busy with Aikan, I'd do a B&B/TM! crossover, where
B&B are exchange students at Tenchi's school, and wind up staying at the
house.

Beavis: "He's got all these chicks, and he never tries to score!"
Butthead: "What a wuss."
Beanis: "But it's not fair! It sucks! It *really* sucks! Why can't *we*
get chicks like that, Butthead? We're never gonna score! Never! Never!"
Butthead (slaps Beavis): "Shut up, assmunch."

Or later...

Nobuyuki: "Don't you want to join us, Tenchi?"
Tenchi: "Cut it out, dad!"
Nobuyuki: "But it's rude, Tenchi. You're *supposed* to peep."
Beavis: "Peeping rules. It *RULES*!"
Butthead: "Huh huh huh. Peeping kicks ass!"
Nobuyuki: "Why can't you be more like these two, Tenchi?"
