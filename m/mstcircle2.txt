Hello to those reading this. I hoped everyone liked my last few MSTing's for I
 will have plenty more where that came from. Especially with this whole series
 of Tenchi fan fics to MST. Really bad. The first was OK but the rest of the
 series gets worst from there on as the series progresses. I should know, I
 looked into them. Oh yeah, this fan fic brings back the guest star from my very
 first one: Samantha Jones! By the way, this is my fifth MST fan fic. Anyhow,
 time for the legal stuff.

Legal Stuff: All the characters and concepts of Mystery Science Theater 3000
 belongs to Best Brains Inc. Please don't sue me for I am merely borrowing your
 characters and not actually placing any claim on them. Except for Samantha
 Jones, that is. She is my character.

To Adam Chris Leigh, please have a sense of humor when you read this.

On with the fan fic!

(DOOR SEQUENCE) 6...5...4...3...2...1...

(Mike and the bots took their seats in the theater and sighed heavily, waiting
 for the fan fic to start. Suddenly there was a flash of light to Tom Servo's
 left, briefly illuminating the theater).

MIKE: What the..?
CROW: Huh?
TOM: Who?

(When the flash of light receded, Samantha Jones was once more on the Satellite
 of Love).

SAMANTHA: Hi guys! (Looks around). Oh no. Did I come in at a bad time?
MIKE: You sure did. Dr. Forrester is treating us to a series of Tenchi fan fics.
SAMANTHA: That doesn't sound too bad. Have you ever read the one I was in?
TOM: No not yet. Anyhow, this one is a self insertion Tenchi crossover fan fic.

(Samantha is silent for a moment before fiddling with her wrist teleporter,
 obviously trying to teleport away).

SAMANTHA: Huh? It's not working!
(Suddenly Dr. Forrester's image fills the screen with the background of Deep 13
 behind him).

ALL: Gyah!
DR. FORRESTER: I knew that you would be back some day Samantha so I made a
 	transdimensional barrier to prevent you from leaving the ship. Now, not
 	only will I break the will of a mere mortal and two robots, but that of a
 	vigilante's as well! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
SAMANTHA: Oh yeah! Well you had better hope that I stay up here because if I get
 	back down to Earth.....(Cracks knuckles and eyes blaze white. An evil
 	chuckling can be heard).
(Dr.Forrester swallowed a lump in his throat and quickly signed off, leaving the
 fan fic to start).

CROW: It's good to have you back regardless of the circumstances Samantha!
SAMANTHA: Thank you Crow!
TOM: Well said.
MIKE: Yeah.
CROW: Thanks. Besides, it's nice to have a hot babe up here. Hubba, hubba!
EVERYONE ELSE BUT CROW: (Groans).

BOTS: (Cheers).
SAMANTHA AND MIKE: HEY!

SAMANTHA: I never would have figured it out if you had put that name there
 	Mr.... Who wrote this anyhow?
MIKE: Adam Chris Leigh.
SAMANTHA: Thanks.

CROW: Are you sure it's Sasami? It might be someone else...

MIKE: Completely off her shoulders. Oh the humanity!

TOM: Sleep Chambers provided from the set of Aliens.

CROW: Are you sure? He might not be.

>
>				SASAMI

CROW: I was having a good dream.....
MIKE: Crow....
SAMANTHA: That was Sasami you were talking about!
CROW: I'm sorry. That was sick, even by my standards.

TOM: So stasismares is a term.
MIKE: It is now.

>
>				SASAMI
>		Alright Azaka, I'll come to the bridge

>
>On the Bridge, AEKA is standing in front of a large tree looking into a

CROW: (Surgeon) We found this ugly growing cancer in a place called Washington
 	D.C. It'll have to be removed.
TOM: (Makes Death Star laser noise).
CROW: (Surgeon) The operation is a success! The planet can now make a full
 	recovery.

>
>				KAMIDAKI
>		We are within full scanning range

MIKE: So you were only doing partial scans before...

>
>				AEKA
>		Proceed with the scans, see if you

SAMANTHA: Scurvy wretch?
TOM: Again with the slaughtering of the original script of the OVA series.
SAMANTHA: You mean this guy is crossing the OVA and TV series of Tenchi with
 	himself in it?
MIKE: Yup.
SAMANTHA: I have a feeling that this will be even worst then Dirty Moon.
CROW: ORGY!

>
>Various screens appear within the big one up in front, several things

CROW: What are Sine waves?
SAMANTHA: And the Sines win 5-0 over the Yankees! (Makes crowd cheering noise).

ALL: Huh?
TOM: That made no sense whatsoever
ALL: Like this fan fic.

>

SAMANTHA: This guy needs to take some grammar lessons.

MIKE: Damn! There goes life support.

TOM: It's the sequence of love.

CROW: How can they find it if the energy sequence is being masked? Oww my head.

>
>				SASAMI (O.S.)
>		Aeka ...
MIKE: what does that O.S. mean?
SAMANTHA: Over sleepy?
TOM: Odor sensitive?
CROW: Oops Sorry?

>
>SASAMI walks onto the bridge with AZAKA following close behind.
>SASAMI comes over to AEKA and looks at the screen showing Earth.
MIKE: I will make as many short sentences as possible to infuriate the reader.
 	BWAHAHA!!!

>
>				AEKA

SAMANTHA: Thrashed? Aeka does not talk like that!
TOM: We know Sam, just smile and nod.
CROW: This from the bot who's head explodes due to his nitpicking.

>

MIKE: Yeah! Those planets can certainly move!

>
>				SASAMI

TOM: A box of chocolates?

 	fics are.

TOM: (Tenchi) Are you still here?

CROW: Inserting yourself into a fan fic? That's a surprise to me....NOT!

>

>RYOUKO appears with her arms draped around TENCHI, he looks

CROW: Who would be annoyed with someone like that wrapped around you? 
SAMANTHA: Tenchi is a very shy guy.

MIKE:(Ryoko) No.

>
>				RYOUKO

CROW: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

SAMANTHA: (Ditto) I gotta remember to make it look like an accident.

>

TOM: So now he's able to talk back to people who could kill him in a 
	microsecond.
MIKE: Another charge to the list?
TOM: Yes.
SAMANTHA: How many so far? 
TOM: Too many to count.

TOM: Why is this guy writing Mihoshi as being so incompetent?
MIKE: Maybe he has something against her...

>

SAMANTHA: (Cubic tool) Self Destruction Sequence activated.

(Everyone in the theater covers their eyes).

TOM: (Mihoshi) The cake is done.

MIKE: (Ditto) I am so baked

CROW: Must. write. like Shatner. speaks.

>
>				ADAM
>		I wonder if this is a good thing
TOM: Heh! Adam will probably destroy the ship or something at the rate he's been
 	going so far.
SAMANTHA: The ship suddenly takes aim and kills Adam with a laser blast. It then
 	leaves.
MIKE: Feeling dark Samantha?
SAMANTHA: Grrrr....

>
>				RYOUKO
>		I don't think so ...

CROW: DING! The Aeka is done, honey!

>
>				AEKA
>		There's the pirate that took Yousho

TOM: But in the OVA series, she only fires a warning shot..(Starts to hold back
	 tears).
MIKE: It'll be okay Tom.
CROW: Fan boy!
TOM: Jerk!
SAMANTHA: (Sighs) Bots...

>
>				KAMIDAKE
>		Yes, Princess Aeka.
CROW: (Kamidake) Yes Princess Aeka. Anything else Princess Aeka. Sheesh! One
	 more command and I quit.

>
>The ship suddenly lurches towards the shore, one of the cannons

SAMANTHA: Usually at this point, everyone would start running.
MIKE: In a good fan fic, but this is not a good fan fic.

TOM: Just keep adding to the list Adam.
SAMANTHA: Why? what was this one?
TOM: Hitting on someone right before they are about to be blown away.

>RYOUKO throws her arms around TENCHI.
CROW: Where they flew through the air until falling into the lake.

MIKE: Aeka learned her Diplomacy from the IRA.
CROW: (IRA spokesman) Remember, if it's harmless and has not done anything to
 	you, blow it away just to be sure!

>
>				KAMIDAKI
>		Yes, your highness.
>
>AEKA's ship fires off a shot into the lake, the wave that ensues

SAMANTHA: Does this guy think everyone would just stand around and wait for a
 	wave to soak them?
CROW: At least Adam got hit.

>

MIKE: (Dr. Forrester) I'm evil!

ALL:BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

ALL: BOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
TOM: Another charge. At this rate, I'll have enough to put Mr. Leigh away for
 	life.

>
>				MIHOSHI
>		Hey! Don't mess with that ...
MIKE: Thus showing that she is not all that dumb.

>
>ADAM moves parts of the cube around until it starts to shake.

SAMANTHA: Wait for it......

ALL:BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

TOM: It blows up, killing him. The End.
MIKE: Now *you're* feeling dark.
TOM: Bite me.

>

CROW: Oh sure. Pass off your mistakes to others.

>
>				RYOUKO

SAMANTHA: This guy is really getting annoying! He makes everyone else seem 
	stupid!

>
>RYOUKO throws the cubic tool at AEKA's ship. A screen on the

MIKE: (Aeka) Finally, the mail has arrived.

>

TOM: (Aeka) AAAAAHHH!!!!!

>
>The cube explodes on the side of AEKA's ship, a large plume of

CROW: So one little cube exploding takes out an entire ship. Oh yeah.....Real
 	believeable.

>
>				RYOUKO
>		Oh well, the witch got what she

ALL: (Singing) Ding Dong! The witch is dead! The wicked witch is dead!

>
>				TENCHI
>		<in awe> Wow ...
MIKE: (Ash from Army of Darkness) Groovy.

>
>				ADAM
>		I wonder if that person is okay
TOM: Once again showing that Adam contributes nothing to the story except for 
	some odd lines.

>
>				RYOUKO
>		I'm sure she isn't, <cheerful> come on 
>		Tenchi! Lets play!
CROW: (Ryoko) Yup! I'm always happy after I've killed someone!

>

SAMANTHA: Squishing them into the ground.

>		Huh? Where am ... I bet I know where

>		I wonder how I can get out of here.
TOM: And here Adam portrays his knowledge of the Tenchi characters by showing
 	that Tenchi only cares about himself and no one else.

>
>As TENCHI walks through a pair of vines, they quickly stiffen 
CROW: Getting horny....
MIKE: Do you want a time out?

 	sword and a space pirate....

SAMANTHA: (Sasami) Of course I am! That's why you're in the brig and I'm walking
 	around free.

CROW: Alright! Now we can do some major riffing!
TOM: Who wants to bet he gets everyone free all by himself?
MIKE: Like that was hard to guess. After all, he is the self insertion
 	character. 
SAMANTHA: He already damaged a Juraian ship, so of course he'll figure a way out 
	of this when the star of the series couldn't!

>
>				ADAM

TOM: (Hopeful) The self insertion is getting annoying? Then you'll stop?
MIKE: Don't get your hopes up.

>ADAM conducts the same experiments as TENCHI did in the last scene,

CROW: Instead, the vines grab him by the throat and throttle him mercilessly.
MIKE: Geez! Now you're sounding dark!
TOM: (Darth Vadar) Come Mike. Join the Dark side.

SAMANTHA: And to learn proper grammar.
MIKE: Okay everyone, that's enough grammar and spelling flames for this story.
OTHERS: (Whiny voice) But they're so easy!

>				AEKA

CROW: (Whiny voice) Can't you see I'm torturing someone?!

TOM: The sequence of love!

CROW: Time to sneak a peek! wink wink, nudge nudge.
SAMANTHA: One more comment like that and *I'll* call time out.
CROW: I'll be good.

TOM: It's the sword hilt! SWORD HILT! DAMN YOU ADAM! TRY TO GET SOMETHING RIGHT
 	IN THIS TWISTED STORY OF YOURS!!!!
MIKE: You gonna be alright?
TOM: (Smoke starts to rise out of his dome and he's breathing heavily). I will.
 	This just hurts.

CROW: Sasami: the next Nabiki.

>TENCHI walks off towards AEKA's bedroom. When TENCHI is gone, SASAMI

>TENCHI pauses for a moment at the foot of her bed.
SAMANTHA: Back good grammar! I drive you away with too many commas in the wrong
 	places and too many short sentences! HUZZAH!

MIKE: (Adam) Wait a second! I'm the author! I can take over the entire universe
 	if I wanted to! Getting out of here will be a snap!

>ADAM stands up and moves closer to the vines. Just as he reaches

TOM: Wait for it people......

ALL: BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>TENCHI is still where we left him, standing at the foot of her bed.

MIKE: Huh?
TOM: What the...
CROW: But isn't he....
SAMANTHA: Repeat after me Adam, Proof reading is our friend.

>
>He finally crawls on top of her and uses all his strength to pull

CROW: Seems like someone is acting out his fantasies....
MIKE: I should hit you for that but you're probably right.
CROW: Probably? I'm dead on the mark.

TOM: ( Game show Announcer)It's the amazing switch a character scene! Watch as
 	the crowds cheer on the excitement!
ALL: (Bored) Yay....

 	of his dome).
MIKE: Careful Tom. You're close to overloading.

>
>				AEKA
>		My my, he runs awfully fast.
TOM: MORE SLANDERING OF THE SCRIPT!!!! AAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! (Head
 	Blows up). KABOOM!!!
SAMANTHA: Oh no! Mike, is he gonna be alright?
MIKE: He will be when his head grows back.
CROW: He certainly is one sensitive fan boy.

MIKE: (Mihoshi) Because you wrote me to.

SAMANTHA: Oh no. I sense great pain coming.
MIKE AND CROW: Why?
SAMANTHA: That was a Jurai key he just picked up and used. Aeka told me that
 	only those of Jurai Royal blood can use them. And he just used it.
CROW: Looks like another charge to add to Tom's list when he comes to.

MIKE: You're right Sam. He does have something against her.

>ADAM walks out of the cage with MIHOSHI following.  He walks down a

CROW: Which he trips over and smashes his head open. The end.
SAMANTHA: My sentiments exactly.

>
>				ADAM

MIKE: Sure Adam. *Whispers to Crow* Get the tranquilizer darts. We've got a live
 	one here.

>
>MIHOSHI is standing by a nearby cage, laughing at one of the animals

TOM: (Smug) Yup. No fan fic can keep me down for long!

CROW: How come she didn't notice Adam holding a key?
SAMANTHA: Because this story has the characters out of character and has no
	 sense of continuity whatsoever.
CROW: Oh.

SAMANTHA: You guys have a time machine?
MIKE: No.
SAMANTHA: Damn.
TOM: Now we have the end.
ALL: YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!
(All get up and leave, Samantha carrying Tom in her arms).

(DOOR SEQUENCE)...1...2...3...4...5...6...

"Well that's the second worst fan fic I was forced to read. How *do* you guys
 get through it," Samantha asked.

Mike is working on Tom's head, the robot currently resting upon the countertop
 with the lights on it, using sealant to fix the cracks on his dome.

"Well I would have to say practice, lots and lots of practice," he answered.

"Which we get plenty of, what with all the movies and fan fics he sends up
 here," Crow added.

"So what are you doing," Samantha asked.

"Preparing a special bad fan fic absorption liquid for Tom. It goes in his head
 so that's why I'm sealing up all the leaks."

"Oh."

"And...there! I'm done. Now for the liquid."

Mike ducked under the countertop and started to rummage around for the liquid.
 As he was doing so, Gypsy came in.

"Hi Gypsy," Samantha said.

"Hello Samantha. When did you get here?"

"At the beginning of the fan fic via my wrist teleporter."

"Ah."

"Only now I can't get out of here because Dr. Forrester placed some kind of
 dimensional shift barrier thingy to prevent me from teleporting away."

"He would do something like that Sam," Gypsy replied. "What's wrong with Tom?"

"Oh I'm making a couple adjustments to him so that he doesn't explode again. You
 know how sensitive he is to his favorite Anime's being slaughtered in such a
 way," Mike explained, standing up with a bottle of golden liquid.

"Hey guys, the Mads are calling," Crow pointed out, seeing the red light flash.

Mike tapped the light and then proceeded to pour the liquid into Tom's dome.

DEEP 13

"So," Dr. Forrester began, a big smile on his face. "Are we all going loony yet?
 Chewing the linoleum? Quacking for no reason?"

SATELLITE OF LOVE

"If that's the best you've got doc, then you might as well quit while you're
 ahead. That was too easy," Samantha bragged.

To her side, a reactivated Tom, Crow, and Mike were shaking their heads and
 mouthing no.

DEEP 13

"Too easy eh? Well let's see what you think once I get out the lemons.
 BWAHAHAHA!!!!"

SATELLITE OF LOVE

"Great going Samantha," Tom said.

"Yeah! The doc probably has a store of Oscar fan fics hidden somewhere for this
 express purpose," Crow said.

"Geez I'm sorry guys," Samantha said. A thoughtful look replaced her sad one.
 "Who's Oscar?"

DEEP 13

The mad scientist would have kept on laughing had not Frank interrupted. TV's
 Frank was looking much better, what with his hair almost completely grown back
 and the green glow on his skin dulled to a slight tint. 	

"Uh Clayton...We have a problem," he began.

"What is it? Is Mihoshi back again?" The scientist actually looked a bit
 worried.

"Uh no...." Before Frank could explain, he was violently shoved aside by a young
 man in his late teens.

"Oh shut up Frank," the young man started, the words coming out like an ugly
 snarl. "Listen here Doc incompetent! I'm taking over!"

Dr. Forrester looked at the young man, surprise in his eyes before being
 replaced by terror. 

"Adam Chris Leigh!"

"That's right," the arrogant writer said. "And I'm inserting myself in here
 because you aren't doing anything right! Why I could break these guys spirits
 in no time! I could even take out your satellite with my Flo-bee...."

The writer babbled on about how he could do everything better then the mad
