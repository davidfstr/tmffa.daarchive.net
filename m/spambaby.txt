The New Years party had wound down and now Aeka, Ryoko and Mihoshi lay
against each other on one couch, snoring heavily.

Tenchi looked down sadly at the infant he held.

"Is something the matter Tenchi?"  The self-proclaimed greatest scientist
in the galaxy asked as she sat next to him.

"I'm just worried that Mayuka will be like her mother was, Washu-chan."

"I wouldn't worry about that Tenchi.  The demon destroyed her daughter by
removing her own contribution."

"Oh."  Tenchi sat and looked at his daughter for a moment.  "Then how?"

"Well Tenchi, your DNA remained in the crystal, so it was a simple matter
to add in my own.  But, if you're worried about Mayuka, maybe we should
get married and raise her as proper parents."

"You What!?!"  Aeka, Ryoko and Mihoshi were now wide awake, their eyes
terribly bloodshot.
