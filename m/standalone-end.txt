I don't own the Ryu-oh, Aeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, or the song Seven Spanish
Angels. Nor am I getting any money as a result of this fic. The End takes
place in an alternate continuality of the OAV, so disregard the entire
series after the first episode.

The End
By Turbo Magnus

Two years had passed since Misaki Tenchi had released the demon Ryoko from
her cave prison. Two years of love and joy after their inital fight. One
year since their marriage. But one day, everything changed. One day a fleet
of Jurian treeships, led by the Ryu-oh and Princess Aeka, the fleet attacked
Ryoko and Tenchi. In their final moments their thoughts turned to a song
they had once heard and how ironic it was that they were living that song.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko looked at Tenchi with a combination of fear and love in her eyes,
"This might be it, Ten-chan."

Tenchi took Ryoko in his arms and held her tight, "As long as we're
together, it's never it."

~He looked down into the brown eyes
And said, "Say a prayer for me."
And she threw her arms around him,
Whispered, "God will keep us free."

The Ryu-oh itself closed in on the two, it's weapons charging.

~They could hear the riders coming.
He said, "This is my last fight.
If they take me back to Texas,
They won't take me back alive."

Ryoko took one last look at Tenchi, "I love you..."
With those last words she flew into the air to face Aeka, by herself. No
matter what happened next, she would die before she would let Tenchi.

~There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun.
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home.
~She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand.

Tenchi's hand brushed across Ryoko's face, closing her eye for the last
time. Tears of loss and saddness dripped down onto her face.

~She said, "Father, please forgive me.
I can't make it without my man."

Ryoko was dead, and with her died Tenchi's reason for living. Without a word
he withdrew the Tenchi-Ken, ignited it, and charged at the ship that had
taken the woman he loved from him.

~And she knew the gun was empty,
And she knew she couldn't win,

To tell the truth, Tenchi didn't care if he lived or died. It didn't matter,
nothing mattered anymore. Ryoko was dead and for all he cared, the world
could burn.

~But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again.

Only feet away from the Ryu-oh, Tenchi was cut down in a blaze. As he died,
the song played in his mind...

~There were seven Spanish angels
At the Altar of the Sun.
They were praying for the lovers
In the Valley of the Gun.
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the throne,
And seven Spanish angels
Took another angel home.

Why did I write this? Honestly I have no idea. It's just been brewing in my
mind for (literally) a couple years now, so I finally put finger to key and
typed it out. Anyone can MST this as long as I am informed, you won't need
to ask my approval. Comments, Critisism, etc to turbomagnus@excite.com In
fact, I think that since Chewy had so many comments I'll see if he'll MST
it. ^_^
