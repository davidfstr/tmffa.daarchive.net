Five Women

***

He's here
I know that he's close
And when
He finds me balled up
Under
The stairs or in my
Room he'll
Hurt me and hit me
And then
When he's done he'll have
His time
And no matter what
I do
Or no matter how
I scream
I just can't break free
>From those
Two strong steely hands
Like ice
They bruise and scar me
Hurting
But nothing hurts like
Knowing
No matter how
I beg
No matter how loud
I scream
No one will ever
Hear me.

***

So I'm small, big deal.
For me, my love is real.
You think size matters,
And that I'm too young to care.
You don't see the love
That I hide, that I would share.
All you see is this
Tiny child you call friend.
Please tell me, really,
Is that all I am to you?

***

I live in a prison
The walls surround my very heart
I put them there before
You came into my desperate life.
Now I can't seem to free
My emotions, but I want to
And I want you to know
That no matter what I may do,
Or how coldly I act,
I really do care about you,
My one and only love.
I know you are close,
I can feel you watching me,
Yet you make no sound.
Shall I wait here forever?
You come to me, I
Feel my body tense with joy.
I see my beauty
In your stare as I come close
To you my only love.
You take my hand, and
As we glide across the floor,
Dancing to a song
That my heart has sung thousands
Of times in the dark,
I know that you will call me
Friend, but for right now,
For this one moment in time,
Hold me in your arms,
And let me dream just a little longer.

***

While you were with her,
I quietly slipped away.
Too hurt to cry out
That I was the one who cared
But you were too blind
To see.

I cried for hours,
An eternity of pain
That was building up
And that I couldn't hold back
Because you're with Her.
And Her isn't me.

***

You're so small in my arms
Little one, funny face,
How did we live before
You came into our lives?
I hold you close to me,
And sing a lullaby
My mother sang to me
And I pretend briefly
That you are my daughter,
And for one small moment,
I imagine that you
Think that I'm your mommy.

Notes:  This was updated for one reason; the poem that was used to finish this
was never meant to be attached.  That was part of a parody called 'When
Giddions Attack' as requested by the 8th floor Giddions in my hall (no joke.
They were pretty happy with it, too).  I never meant for it to be attached to
these poems.  Gomen.  ^^;;
