Disclaimer: Except for me, I don't own any of the characters used in this FF.  
No money is passing hands here, no need to sue.  This MST is done in fun.  Yea.

The Millennium Eagle had been zipping around the galaxy for a few days.  Doing 
fly-by's of other MST ships, jumping back to warp, and then buzzing them again.  
Her Captain was bored out of his mind, for Command not doing much to entertain 
him.  So he was surfing the 'net, being a dork.  And no, Jim had yet to begin 
looking for the TeaCup.  He was waiting for them to goof.

Comm Officer: "Sir, incoming message for you.  Looks like a story."
Jim: "'Bout damn time Command sent me something.  I was beginning to feel 
abandoned.  Computer, locate MST crew."
Computer: "MST crew is in holodeck one."
Jim: "What are they doing in the holodeck?  Helm, you have the Conn."

After a short turbolift ride to holodeck one, he found the answer to his 
question.  Tenchi and the MSTers had recreated his house, and were all acting 
like the family.  Jim walked up to the front of the house, then decided a 
different tact.

Jim: "Computer, end program."

Apparently the MSTers had been upstairs, listening to Tenchi and his stories, 
and telling their own.  Now they were hovering in mid-air for a couple of 
seconds, not realizing that the house was gone.

Jim: "Are you guys going to come down from there?"

At the sound of Jim's voice, they turned their heads to look at him.

Jim: "Down here."

They all looked down, and realized that the floor was gone.

CRASH!  BANG!  WHAPANG!  CRUNCH!

And they hit the floor.

Jim: "Got a short story for us to do . . . into the theatre yet again."

MSTers:
Jim Ohki: "Yea, we have a story to do."
Tenchi and Ayeka Masaki: "Why did he drop us on the floor?"
Ash and Misty Ketchum: "My back hurts!"
Chi-Chi and Mihoshi (they will be in and out): "For a practical joke, that was 
good."

>Ryoko vs. ???
>The dumbest battle ever

Tenchi: "Ah crap.  Not one of these."
Jim: "It's better than nothing."
Ash: "Nothing?"

>By Katherine "Suicune" Lindroth (www.renogatomon@AOL.com)

>Disclaimer: I do not own Ryoko or any of the Tenchi cast, they belong to
>Pioneer and AIC, I also don't own Zohar (Zofal, Sandalphon)
>erm.......um........Zohar is owned by the Treasure Company (Makes video
>games
>^_^) Oh and I don't own super smash bros. or any other Anime either, so
>don't
>sue me!

Ayeka: "Rogue returns everywhere, Captain."
Misty: "Is this a NinTenchi crossover?"
Jim: "HELL NO!"
Mihoshi and Chi-Chi are having a pie eating contest.

>*The scene opens up with Suicune (Me) holding a microphone, behind her are
>thousands of screaming Anime fans*

>SUICUNE: AND NOW THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEEEEEEEEN WAITING FOR!
               >THE FINAL ROUND OF ANIME SMASH BROTHERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>CROWD:*Cheers*
>SUICUNE: I THIS CORNER, SO FAR, THE UNDEFEATED CHAMPION RYOKO
               >HABUKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Jim: "Alright, what's with the center alignment?"
Tenchi: "Don't look at me.  Who's 'Suicune (Me)' anyway?"
Ash: "That would probably be the author, trying to be descriptive."
Chi-Chi and Mihoshi (from Jim's quarters): "WE WANT STRUDEL!"
Jim: "Ah, the joys of having two . . ." (the rest wasn't heard, as Jim had 
walked into his quarters.)

>*Ryoko walks out, along with the rest of the Tenchi crew*
>CROWD*Cheers themselves hoarse*

Sounds of crickets are made.  People look around at each other.  Chaos had 
nothing to do.  Somebody farted.  Sounds of nut scratching can be heard.
Tenchi and Ayeka: "What are we, just support characters?"
Ash: "What are you supporting?"
Disturbed's "Down With The Sickness" can be heard on the sound system in Jim's 
quarters . . . the bass alone is making the floor vibrate.

>RYOKO: This is it! I'm gonna be the best fighter in the world!
>TENCHI: You shouldn't get to cocky Ryoko, I mean, this is the last fight,
>and
>that
            >Goku dude almost beat you.......

All: "What the hell was that?"
Tenchi: "I don't talk like that, do I?"
Ayeka: "That looks like old Mihoshi speak."
Tenchi: "True."
Jim (from his quarters): "YOU ONLY GET THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID 'OLD'!"

>RYOKO: Oh Tenchi I didn't know you cared so much!
>AYEKA: That's enough Miss Ryoko!
>YUGI: Yeah, I don't wanna throw up again

All: "NOT A SHIN TENCHI WRITER!  JIM, HELP US!"
Jim (comes running back in): "WHAT?  You disturb me . . ." (sees the name on the 
fic) " . . . AH CRAP!"

>SUICUNE: AND THE CHALLENGER! CELL!
>RYOKO: Oh shit....
>*We see Cell just standing there, he suddenly explodes into a pile of ebony
>colored muck*

Jim: "That defies the laws of physics.  Something that explodes, usually goes up 
and out, not down and in."
Rest: "This STORY defies the laws of physics, and you know it!"

>SASAMI: Doesn't that mean Ryoko wins?
>???:Not exactly....
>*A small girl jumps from the shadows, holding a rifle in her hand*

All: "A rifle did Cell in?  NOT BLOODY LIKELY!"

>RYOKO: What's your name kid?
>GIRL: *Spits on Ryokos shoe* Don't play cute with me..........
>SUICUNE: IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A NEW CHALLENGER!!!!!!!!!
               >ZOHAR SANDALPHON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>RYOKO: Of all the stupid names, who are you anyway?
>SANDALPHON: From a Playstation game, I'm also a friend of Suicune

Jim: "And the lack of punctuation continues."
Tenchi: "It almost looks like this writer doesn't like us?"
Ayeka: "No duh.  And what game is this Zohar from?"
Chaos fell asleep in the hammock.

>SUICUNE:Ah hee hee hee heh heh heh.........................oh well, START
>THE
>FIGHT!
>RYOKO: PADAL BLAST!

Tenchi: "Okay, when did Ryoko start naming her attacks?"
Ayeka: "As far as I know, she didn't."
Jim: "This looks like a bad DBZ fusion."
Misty: "You sure can state the obvious, you know?"

>SANDALPON: ARMOR GRIP!
>*A giant ball of pink light surrounds Sandalphon, absorbing the bolts and
>creating a type of armor on her body*
>RYOKO: HEY! No fair cheating!
>SANDALPON: Come on! I'm only three feet tall!
SUICUNE: IT LOOKS LIKE SANDALPON IS GETTING READY FOR HER
               >JUDGEMENT ATTACK!!!!!
>SANDALPHON: Are you ready?
>RYOKO: Bring it on!
>SANDALPHON: THERE'S NO ESCAPE FOR YOU NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
>*Puny Sandalphon turns into a giant Gundam Wing like monster and pulls out
>her blaster which is now x10000 times bigger*

All: O_O' "WHAT THE?!  SHE'S JUST GOT F.U.B.A.R.!

>SANDALPHON:RAILED CANNON x5

>RYOKO:Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

>rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

>ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!

Jim: "That looks like an old Garfield cartoon."
Tenchi: "Probably where she got it."
Ash: "And I guess that means we're on the downhill side of the story."
Ayeka: "Hill?  This story was like a speed bump."
Misty: "Ouch."

>TENCHI CREW: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
>RYOKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
>*There is a smoldering pit where Ryoko once stood*
>SUICUNE: AND SANDALPON IS THE CHAMPION!!!!..........by a long....shot......
>AYEKA: *Starts crying*
>TENCHI: No.......
>YUGI: Ryoko.........

All (make cross symbol with their index fingers): "BAD!  GO TO HELL!"

>SASAMI: I don't belive it...
>MIHOSHI: IS Ryoko gone Kiyone?
>KIYONE: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>WASHU: She isn't gone

Jim: "So, Washu already has some plan to revive Ryoko.  That sounds more like 
the Washu I met."

>ALL(Excluding Washu) HUH?
>SANDALPON: What do you mean?
>WASHU: Simple, you can revive the dead right?
>SANDALPHON: Errrrrrr, yes

Jim: "Okay, perhaps not."

>*Sandalphon changes back to her puny little self and throws a slab of some
>magical parasites into the hole*
>RYOKO:Unnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn........................huh? Wha? HOLY
>SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!
>SUICUNE:What the-
>*Some kooky little half and half witch/Sailor Moon kid gets out of the hole*
>SANDALPHON:Oops...
>RYOKO/SHYNA:YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
>SANDALPHON:EYYYAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>THE END ^_^

>Oh, could someone puh-lease MST this dumb story, I'd be grateful.

Tenchi: "Ask, and ye shall receive.'
Jim: "I told you that it was short.  What did you think?"
Rest: "WHAT'S THAT SMELL?!  A BAD FIC!"
Jim: "Ouch.  Details never did hurt anybody.  Dismissed."

Jim returns to the bridge, and sees a small stack of PADDS on his chair.  He 
picks them up, reads the tops, puts them down.

Jim: "Helm, set course 288 mark 41.  Speed, warp nine."
Selphie: "Course and speed laid in, sir."
Jim: "Engage."

The Millennium Eagle jumps to warp, heading for another stop in the galaxy . . .
