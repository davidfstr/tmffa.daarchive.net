Summary: The MiSTers are bragging about their tolerance for disgusting
lemons when M overhears them. She gives them a horrific lemon to MiST to see
who can take the pain, giving the remaining MiSTers a week long vacation to
wherever they want. But will there be any MiSTers left?

Disclaimer: I don't own Tenchi Muyo!, it's characters or their respective
likeness. I didn't write this fic. All the characters MiSTing it are mine.

(All of the MiSTers are sitting around the conference table, talking and
snacking. Kalila is sitting on Kalinda's lap.)

Melanie: You know, after all the MiSTing that we do, I've got a stomach like
a concrete elephant.
Jarred: Yeah, none of us had thrown up in a while.
Dominick: We're getting used to the crap. Pretty soon, it'll have no effect
on us.
Kalila: Mew!
Deangelo: What did she say?
Gwen: She was agreeing with Dominick.
Kalinda: Me too. I mean, we got through MiST thirty-three without using a
single barf bag.
Tempest: Yeah, but now sex is a little uninteresting now. You wouldn't
believe what my boyfriend had to do to keep me from falling asleep on him.
Again.
Melanie: Yeah, I don't think I've ever thrown up once in all the MiSTs.
M: Ooo, big tough guys huh?
Jarred: AHHHH! M! I didn't see you, standing there!
M: Oh, I have this way of popping up in different places. But if I heard
correctly, you guys are saying that you've become immune to the crappy
lemons that I've been giving you?
Dominick: Yep. They're starting to have no effect.
M: Well, in that case, these next MiST shouldn't be a problem.
Melanie: We can take whatever you've got.
Gwen: Yes M, what've you got.
M: Extremely Sick Sex Fest.
Jarred: But isn't that the lemon that-
Kalinda: (Cuts Jarred off.) We'll do it.
Deangelo: And then you'll see that no matter what kind of lemon you give us,
we can handle it.
M: Alrighty then. The MiSTers who doesn't vomit their internal organs, pass
out or leave, gets a week long vacation to anywhere they want.
Tempest: (^_^) How about Antonio's pants?
M: (Shrugs.) If that's what you want.
Tempest: Score! I'm in!
Melanie: Me too. Let's get this party started.
M: (^-^) Okay, let's go.
Deangelo: I don't know why you have such a big smile on your face.
M: Oh, you'll find out.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

(All of the MiSTers sit in their respective seats and prop their feet up on
the seats in front of them.)

All MiSTers: Bring it on, M!
M: (From the control room.) Alrighty. You asked for it.

>Extremely Sick Sex Fest

Dominick: Next on FOX.

>By the fucked up mind of AAA-PhuckNut

Gwen: Ahhh, so this lemon isn't just fucked up, it's "phucked up".

>Disclaimer:

Melanie: This lemon is stupid. Avoid it at all costs.

>This Fic is extremely disgusting and filled with sex

Tempest: Woo-hoo!

>so you have to be

Deangelo: Stupid to continue reading this.

>18+ to read this, oh, and read at your own risk.

Jarred: Yeah, like we're going to die from reading this.
M: (From the control room.) Don't speak too soon, Jarred.

>All the characters in this fic are owned by AIC and Pioneer, I do not claim
>these characters.

Dominick: Well, ain't that a coincidence? I don't either.

>________________________________________________________________

Tempest: Page break! Page break!

>Tenchi woke up extra early this morning before

Kalinda: The View. Because he didn't want to miss any of it.

>Ryoko would show up

Deangelo: And make him wash behind his ears.
Jarred: And wash all his dirty clothes.

>so that Tenchi could test out something he's always wanted to do...

Gwen: His taxes.
Dominick: Sleep in.
Tempest: Run around the house naked!
Melanie: Listen to his O-Town CD.

>"Yes! No body will be bothering me for at least 2 hours!" Tenchi gleefully
>said.

Jarred: (Tenchi) Now would be a perfect time check out that anti-crappy
hentai organization that was sending me flyers.

>"Now will be the perfect time to do what I've always wanted to do!

Kalinda: Jump off a cliff.
Dominick: Like I said before, sleep in. That's what I always want to do.
Melanie: Uhhh, I know what you always want to do and it's got nothing with
sleeping.
Tempest: (^_^) Ooo!

>SUCK MY OWN DICK!!"

All MiSTers: (Gob smacked, O_O?!?!?!) . . . . . .
Melanie: Okay, I don't think any of us expected him to say that.

>Tenchi beamed very proudly.

Gwen: Looks like this kid needs a hobby more then Tempest does.
Tempest: Hey! I have a hobby!
Dominick: Other then sex?
Tempest: Who said that sex can't be a hobby?! Huh?! Huh?!
Deangelo: No one, Tempest. Now calm down.

>Tenchi then got a big erection at the thought of this.

Jarred: (Looks at Dominick.) But, isn't it impossible to, uhhh, do THAT?
Dominick: Why the hell are you looking at me?!?!?!?!?
Tempest: Yeah, he's got Mel to do that.
Melanie: (O_O!!!) Tempest!!!!!
Gwen: Melanie, Melanie, calm down!!!
Melanie: (Trying to crawl over Deangelo's lap to strangle Tempest.) Lemme at
her!!! Lemme at her!!!
Jarred: Kalinda! Kalinda!!! I'm scared!!!
Deangelo: (Restraining Melanie.) Stop it right now, or I'll take away your
thong collection!
Kalinda: That only works on Tempest!!!
Deangelo: Damn!
Tempest: Ooo, I just love it when you get all worked up Melanie, it's so
sexy. (^_-)
Melanie: I'll kill her!!!!!!

(Dominick stands up and grabs Melanie away from Deangelo who's struggling to
hold her back from Tempest who is sitting quite casually next to him.
Dominick sits down next to Deangelo, putting Melanie his other side.)

Dominick: (To Melanie.) Now if you don't stop it, the only thing that's
going to be on TV for the rest of the week is the VMA 2001 performance of
Lady Marmalade!
Melanie: (Pouts.) Fine!
Gwen: Alright, now everyone take a deep breath.

(All of the MiSTers take a deep breath.)

Gwen: Everyone feel better now?
Others: Yeah. . . .

>Tenchi then bent forward as far as he could, but it just wasn't quite
>enough >though, he was so close...

Deangelo: Getting a serious spinal disorder.

>He pushed himself farther and farther and finally got it!

Kalinda: (Clapping her hands.) Wow! What an accomplishment!

>"YES!"

Dominick: He's got his own dick in his mouth and he can still talk. . . Wow.
. .
Tempest: Now that takes talent.

>Tenchi managed to mumble out as he stuck his dick into his mouth.
>Tenchi moaned as sucked his own dick faster and faster.

Gwen: (0_o) Uhh, where did M say those barf bags were again?
Jarred: No, Gwen! You can't throw up!
Melanie: Yeah, then M'll win.

>After a half-hour  of dick sucking action, he finally blew his nut into his
>mouth.

Jarred: (9_9) It blew up? Wouldn't that hurt?
Deangelo: Didn't your parents ever sit you down for The Talk when you were a
teenager?
Jarred: About choosing the right auto insurance company? Yeah. Why?
Deangelo: Never mind. . .

>Tenchi swallowed his own seed very happily,

Gwen: (Turns a little green.) Ew. . .
Kalinda: I have a really bad feeling that it only gets worse from here. . .

>"MMMMM! Absolutely FUCKING delicious!" Tenchi said after swallowing his
>jizz.

Dominick: "Jizz"?
Gwen: Barf. . . bag. . . . now. . .
Deangelo: (Hands her a barf bag.) It's alright, Gwenavere.

>Little did Tenchi know though, that he wasn't the only one commiting
>bizzare sexual acts this lovely morning...

Kalinda: There's more? After THAT?

(Gwen vomits in the barf bag that Deangelo handed her.)

M: (From the control room.) You alright Gwen?
Gwen: Guys, never have pizza before you MiST. Yes, I'm fine M. Just a little
nauseous.
M: (From the control room.) And we're only getting started.
Jarred: What did we get ourselves into?

>________________________________________________________________

Tempest: Page break! Page  break!

>Noboyuki proceeded up the stairs to the shrine to meet his father-in-law,
>Yosho.

Dominick: I'm getting this really bad feeling all of a sudden. . .
Melanie: Let's examine the evidence, shall we? A guy, in a bad lemon, is at
a temple waiting for another guy, who's also in this bad lemon, to show up.
Tempest: Looks like we're gonna get some yaoi action.

>"Grrr, he's late again." said Yosho.

Jarred: Yoshi! How did Yoshi get into this lemon?
Dominick: Oh perfect. A barney clone. Just what we need in this lemon.
Kalinda: It's not Yoshi, it's Yosho.
Tempest: Hey! Yo-s-HO!
Gwen: So he's a man ho. . . Oh dear. . .

>Yosho opened up a orange blow-pop to satisfy his sucking need

Tempest: Sucking need?
Kalinda: Oh God. . . Yaoi approaching. . . Everyone batten down the hatches.

>while he waited for Noboyuki to arrive.

Jarred: What are they going to do when Noboyuki arrives? Play Chess?
Dominick: (To Gwen.) Are you sure we should be letting him watch this?
Gwen: Come on, Dominick. He's sat through thirty-seven other MiSTs. I doubt
this one is going to have an impact on him. Innocence is one of his
permanent character traits.

>"Oh no! Im late again!

Kalinda: Yes. . . We've established this fact.

>I hope father isnt angry!" said Noboyuki.

Tempest: I bet he'll be pissed! Japanese guys don't like to be kept waiting
when booty is involved.
Deangelo: And you know this from experience, huh?
Tempest: Of course.

>Noboyuki finally arrived at the shrine and apologized to Yosho for being
>late,

Dominick: Then Yosho told him what his son had been doing earlier. . .
Kalinda: At the rate this lemon is going I bet he'd be jealous.

>"Im sorry for being late, honorable father." said Noboyuki.

Melanie: (Noboyuki.) Please have mercy on my poor, hentai soul!!!

>"That is ok." said Yosho as he threw his blow-pop into the trash.

Deangelo: Maybe it's just me, but I can't really see a Japanese grandfather
eating American candy that is targeted at fifth graders.
Tempest: Wow. I didn't even think of that.

>"Shall we get started?

Jarred: Yay!! They're going to play Chess. I just love Chess. It's my
favorite board game.

>Would you mind if I could go first?" asked Noboyuki.

Gwen: Jarred, honey, I don't think they're going to play Chess. . .

>"Yes you may go first Noboyuki, because I was first last time." said Yosho

Jarred: Yes they are. (Points at the screen.) See, they're deciding who's
going to go first.

>as he started to warm up his mouth muscels some more.

Melanie: Maybe so, but Chess doesn't involve mouth "muscels".
Tempest: In the game I play it does. (^_^)

>Noboyuki then took off his pants to reveal a large schlong.

Jarred: (O_O!!) AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dominick: Damn, Jarred! You scream like a girl!
Melanie: Hey!
Dominick: He does!

>Yosho then started to work his mouth magic on Noboyuki's cock.

Jarred: (Sobbing.) I thought they were just going to play a nice game of
Chess!!!! It's not fair!!!!!
Gwen: (o_0) Another barf bag, please. . .

>"Mmmmmm, that feels so good father." moaned Noboyuki.

Tempest: Don't call him dad while you're going down on him. It's just wrong.
. .

>Yosho then worked faster on Noboyuki's penis, slowly turning his penis
>orange from the blow-pop.

Gwen: (O_O!!) Barf bag!!! Barf bag!!!

>"Ooooohhhhh, YYESSSSSSSSS! here i come!" yelled Noboyuki.

(Gwen vomits into a different barf bag.)

Deangelo: Gwenavere? Are you sure you want to continue MiSTing? You look
very green.
Gwen: I wanted the week long vacation, but I think I want to keep my
internal organs more. Sorry to bail on you, guys.
Melanie: It's alright, more of a chance of me getting the vacation. Hope
you're feeling better Gwen.
Gwen: Thank you, Melanie., Good-bye everyone. See you at the next MiST.
Others: Bye Gwen!

(Gwen walks out of the MiSTing room.)

M: (From the control room.) One down. . . six to go. . .

>Noboyuki then exploded into Yosho's mouth.  Yosho held it in his mouth

Tempest: So I take it, he spits.
Kalinda: Ew.
Tempest: What? You swallow?
Kalinda: I don't even give head.
Tempest: You are so boring.
Kalinda: Coming from you, I'll take that as a complement.

>then stood up and kissed Noboyuki and spit half the jizz into Noboyuki's
>mouth

Dominick: There's that "jizz" thing again. . .

>so that he could swallow some too.

Tempest: Whoa, a whole family of swallowers.

>"mmmm, very tasty, Noboyuki" said Yosho.
>"Yes I agree very much." said Noboyuki.

Jarred: (;_;) Are they going to play Chess now?

>Just then Ryo-ohkie walked into the shrine, a very hungry Ryo-ohkie.

Kalinda: (^_^) Oh look! It's that cute little cabbit!
Melanie: (^_^) Awww! She's adorable!

>When she saw Noboyuki's orange penis she thought it was a carrot,

Tempest, Melanie & Dominick: She did what?

>and she became overjoyed.

Deangelo: Everyone. . . barf bags.

>She lunged at Noboyuki and bit off his whole dick in one swift chomp.

MiSTers: (O_O!!!!) AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

(Dominick vomits into his barf bag.)

Melanie: Dom, it's okay, this is just a very crappy fic. Don't give in,
honey.
Dominick: That cabbit just. . . just. . . (He vomits again.)
Jarred: Kalinda, I'm scared!
Kalinda: I am too!
Tempest: He. . . he. . .  doesn't have a dick anymore! Wow, that's going to
be really bad for his sex life.
Deangelo: (Still in shock, O_O!) Dear God. . . .

>"AAAAAAAAHHHHH!" Noboyuki screamed as his cock was bitten off.
>Suprisingly though, Noboyuki seemed to be not mad at all.

Tempest: You'd think he gets his dick bitten off everyday.

>"Noboyuki! Your penis was just bit off and you dont care at all??!!" beamed
>Yosho.

Dominick: (VERY green.) Mellie, can I borrow your barf bag?
Melanie: (Giving Dominick her barf bag.) It's okay, honey. I know you can
survive this.
Deangelo: (Turning green.) Melanie? Would you happen to have another barf
bag over there?
Tempest: Come on, people. This is nothing.

>"No, actually I kinda like it.  Cause now I got an extra hole for you to
>fuck!!!" said Noboyuki proudly.

(Dominick and Deangelo vomit simultaneously.)

Jarred: (Latched onto Kalinda.) Make it stop! Make it stop!
Deangelo: I am sorry, my fellow MiSTers. But I must join Gwenavere.
Melanie: Come on, D! You can handle this! You've been around Tempest long
enough!
Deangelo: I do apologize. But I value my life over a week long vacation.

(Deangelo leaves the MiSTing room.)

M: (From the control room.) Two down . . . five to go.

>"Ahh yes! I see! I can insert my penis into the hole on the little
>remaining stub where your cock used to be!" said Yosho very excitedly.

Tempest: (o_0) Well . . . uhhh, at least they're creative.

>Yosho then removed his robe and stuffed his old schlong into Noboyuki's
>penis stub.  He then rapidly fucked Noboyuki.

Dominick: Melanie. . . If I don't make it I want you to give my CD
collection to Shane and donate my brain to charity.
Tempest: What charity would want your brain?
Melanie: Shut up Tempest. Now stop talking like that, Dom. You're going to
get through this. Then we can go on a nice vacation.

>"Oh yes! Its so smooth!" yelled Yosho.

Kalinda: Oh! I know! (Singing.) If you said, this life ain't good enough, I
would give my world to life you up. I would change my life to better suit
your mood. Because you're SO smooth. (Stops singing.) Come on now,
everybody!
Melanie: Kalinda, what are you trying to accomplish?
Kalinda: Well, if we sing maybe that'll keep our minds off of the MiST.
Melanie: Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Dominick: But. . . the lyrics. . . it's so smooth? (Vomits again.)

>Noboyuki was in total exctasy from all the pleasure he was getting from
>Yosho fucking him in his small intestine.

M: (From the control room.) Don't forget kids, additional barf bags can be
located underneath your seats or in the arm rests.

>Ryo-ohkie just watched with a puzzled look on her face,

Tempest: Cause it's not every day you bite off someone's dick.

>then she just left and headed back to the house.

Jarred: Yes! Run little cabbit! Save yourself!

>"Here I come!!!!" screamed Yosho.

Melanie: Then do us all a favor and leave! Now!

>Yosho then dropped a steaming hot load into Noboyuki's small intestine.

Dominick: (Turns SOA room carpet green.) I don't know if I can take much
more of this.

>"That felt so great!! It was almost as good as getting fucked in the ass by
>an elephant!!" said Noboyuki excitedly.

Tempest: An elephant?! It there anything these guys WON'T do?
Melanie: More like; is there anything this author won't do?

>"You have been fucked in the ass by an elephant before??" questioned Yosho.

Jarred: Ummm, wouldn't that be physically impossible?
Dominick: Between Tenchi giving himself a blow job, this guy getting his
dick ripped off and not caring, then having sex with his father in law
through his small intestines, do you think the author cares?!?!
Melanie: I'm guessing, not.

>"Yes it was pure exctasy!" said Noboyuki.
>"Damn! You are one lucky bastard!" said Yosho.

Kalinda: The only lucky bastard is the one who doesn't have to MiST this
fic!

>They both french kissed each other, then got dressed and headed to the
>house for breakfast.

Tempest: No cuddling after sex through the small intestine?

>________________________________________________________________

Tempest: Page break! Page break!
Melanie: There, see Dom? No matter how horrible a MiST is, Tempest will
always be there to point out page breaks.

>Tenchi had already gotten up and waited in the kitchen for Sasami earlier
>this morning.

Jarred: Uhhh. . .

>Everyone else arrived in the kitchen after smelling the good cooking.

Kalinda: Ahhh, the sent of roasted hentai in the morning.

>"Watcha cookin Sasami?" asked everyone else as they came into the kitchen.

Melanie: (Sasami.) Roasted hentai! Would you like some?!

>"Oh I cooked something we've never had before!" said a very proud Sasami.
>"And what may that be?" asked Ryoko.

Melanie: Duh! Roasted hentai. We had to find SOMETHING to do with the
bastards.

>"Elephant Penis!" said a happy Sasami.

All remaining MiSTers: (O_O!!) Uhhhhhh. . . .
Tempest: Hey, I bet it's considered a big delicacy in some country.
Dominick: (Twitching.) Yeah. . . delicacy. . .

>"Sounds delicious!" said Ryoko and Ayeka.

Dominick: Barf bag! Barf bag!

>Yosho and Noboyuki just looked at each other and smiled.

(Dominick vomits into yet another barf bag. Melanie glances at him, then
sets a very large stack of barf bags on his lap.)

Melanie: Use those next honey, cause I'm not going to let anything get in
the way of my week long vacation with you.

>"All done! here ya go guys!" said Sasami.
>Sasami placed the platter with a giant sausage looking thing on it, down on
>the >table.

Dominick: Don't tell me they're going to eat it.
Jarred: Dominick, you don't look so good. . .
Kalinda: Hey Jarred, how come you've lasted so long? I thought you'd be the
first person out.
Jarred: I'm thinking of happy things. Like fluffy bunnies, and warm summer
days, and drinking hot chocolate and cuddling with the one you love. (^_^)
I'm so happy, Kalinda.

>Everyone dug in and complemented Sasami on her excelent cooking.

Melanie: I'd hate to see what she made for desert.

(Dominick vomits again.)

Jarred: Ewww. . .
Melanie: Dom? Are you okay?
Dominick: I'm sorry honey, but you're gonna have to go on your vacation
along. I'm going to go watch a Disney movie.

(Dominick leaves the MiSTing room.)

M: (From the control room.) Three down, four to go.

>"Hey guys, I got something to show all of you." said Sasami.

Tempest: (Sasami.) My new routine for the strip club!

>"What is it?" everyone asked.
>Sasami then jumped on the table and stripped naked quickly.

Tempest: Woo-hoo! (Starts humming a stripper theme.)

>She then grabbed Ryo-ohkie and masturbated with her head.

Jarred: Not the cabbit! Not the cabbit!!! The cute fluffy little cabbit!!!!
NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kalinda: (0_0) Damn. . . don't mess with the man's cabbit.

>"Wow thats a great trick!" Tenchi said.

Jarred: (;_;) No, it's not!!!

>Ayeka then grabbed ahold of Ryo-ohkies legs and spread the little cabbits
>pussy lips apart and started to lick them viciously.

Jarred: (O_O!!!) NO!!! Leave the cabbit alone!!! Oh there is no justice in
this world!!!!!

>After a while the little cabbit had an orgasm at the same time that Sasami
>had >one.  Both their female cum covering the table.

(Jarred runs out of the MiSTing room.)

M: (From the control room.) Four down, three to go.
Melanie: Do you enjoy making us suffer!?
M: (From the control room.) Oh, but I thought you big tough MiSTers could
take this.

>"Hey Ryoko... I got something I need to tell you." Tenchi said.

Kalinda: (Tenchi.) You were adopted.
Melanie: (Tenchi.) I'm wearing your underwear.
Tempest: (Tenchi.) I'm pregnant with your baby!
Melanie: Hey, that was really good. Come on ladies, we can do it if we just
stick together!

>"Ok Tenchi, lets go to your room." Ryoko said as she grabbed onto Tenchi
>and teleported them to Tenchi's room.

Kalinda: Teleported? Dude.

>"Ryoko... I... I...

Melanie: (Tenchi.) I have a speech impediment.

>WANT TO FUCK YOU LIKE A WILD ANIMAL!!" Tenchi said nervously to Ryoko.

Tempest: Yay!!! Non-family, straight sex!!!

>"Oh Tenchi!! You dont know how long I've waited for you to say that!!" said
> >Ryoko very excitedly.

Kalinda: Four seconds. . .

>Tenchi then felt a sudden wave of insanity come over him as he grabbed onto
>Ryoko and shoved his penis into her.

Melanie: Here we go again.

>"OOOOOOOHHH TENCHI!!! YEEEEEEESSSS!!!" screamed Ryoko.

Tempest: You'd think they could scream something a little more creative
during sex.

>"GGGGRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAAARRRR!!!!"

Kalinda: (0_0!) Does that count as creative, Tempest?

>screamed Tenchi as his eyes suddenly glowed red.

Tempest: Dude! Where'd he get those colored contacts.
Melanie: I don't like the look of this. . .

>As soon as Tenchi's eyes turned red, his penis just suddenly grew massive
>in girth and length.

Tempest: (<3_<3) Oh . . . my. . . God. . . It's huge.

>It grew so big that all the blood went to his penis and he fainted.  His
>penis got >so big it pierced through Ryoko's body and straight up through
>her head, >splitting her whole body in half vertically.

Tempest: AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Melanie: Calm down, Tempest! Calm down!!!

>Each half of her body slid off Tenchi's penis and each one slid down to
>opposite >sides of the bed.

Tempest: SHE'S DEAD!!!!
Kalinda: Tempest, chill!
Tempest: She died because of sex!!! Is that going to happen to me?! I don't
wanna die!!!! I'm too beautiful!!!
Melanie: That's NOT going to happen to you, Tempest. Think positively! You
can get through this lemon!

>Then Tenchi's penis went back to its normal size and Tenchi woke up,

Tempest: (o.o) It shrunk. . .
Kalinda & Melanie: ARG!

>"whaaa... whaat happend?" Tenchi said as he woke up.

Kalinda: (Tenchi.) Musta been smoking too much crack again.

>"OH MY GOD!!" Tenchi screamed as he saw Ryoko's mangled body halves. "It
> >must have been that bitch Ayeka!!" Tenchi screamed

Melanie: Oh yeah sure, don't take your killer dick into consideration!

>not knowing that it was actually him.
>Tenchi then ran down to the living room and up to Ayeka, who was sitting on
>the couch by herself,

Tempest: Watch out, woman! He's got a killer dick!!!

>"You filthy hore!!!!

Melanie: What's a "hore"?

>You killed my Ryoko!!!!" screamed Tenchi.

Kalinda: No, actually, you killed your Ryoko.

>"Wha.." is all that Ayeka got to say before Tenchi attacked.

Tempest: (Leaping onto Melanie's lap.) Killer dick! Killer dick!

>Tenchi grabbed one of her nostrils and stretched it to acommodate his
>penis.

Kalinda & Melanie: What the hell?

>He then rammed his hard cock up into her nose, shattering all her facial
>bones around her nose.

Tempest: She's gonna die!!! She's gonna die from sex!!!!!
Melanie: Be strong, Tempest! Be strong!

>His cocked pierced up into her brain, then he blew his load into her brain.
>  He >pulled his penis out and watched as Ayeka wriggled around on the
>couch, then finally died.

Tempest: (O_O) She died!!! Sex can kill you!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

(Tempest runs out of the MiSTing room.)

>________________________________________________________________
>THE END

Melanie: Tempest! Don't run! It's the end, of. . . . the lemon. Never mind.
M: (From the control room.) Five down, two to go.
Kalinda: Well, Melanie. It's down to just the two of us.

>Well how did you like my second fan fic?

Melanie: It was pretty fucking disgusting.

>Pretty fucking disgusting isnt it?

Kalinda: Yeah, that's what Melanie just said.

>Send me your comments

Melanie: Flames!

>at: viperz00@winfire.com

Kalinda: More flames!
Melanie: God, it's over, let's go!

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

(Melanie and Kalinda are back in the conference room picking out a Disney
movie.)

M: So, ladies. You lasted through the MiST. Where would you like to go?
Kalinda: Hawaii?
Melanie: Yeah, I'd go for Hawaii. Looks like a nice place. It's away from
Tempest. And these horrible lemons. . .
M: Great. Well, have fun girls, I'll see you in MiST 38.
Kalinda & Melanie: Bye, M!

(M zaps Kalinda and Melanie to a Hawaiian resort. Kalila hops up onto the
conference table.)

Kalila: Mew?
M: What do you mean; "why didn't I let you watch the lemon?"!! Didn't you
