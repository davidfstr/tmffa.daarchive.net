A Letter to Little Washu,

I sit here alone, with my two cats, Ryo-Ohki and Tenchi, on the seventh anniversary of my 
dear child's birth.  I miss her ever so much.  A tear runs down my cheek and I don't try 
to catch it. There's something refreshing in its presence. I blink a little and try to 
type some more...

Oh Washu... Little Washu... I know the pain you went through when you lost your firstborn 
child. I know your heart-ache. I know how it feels knowing that when you don't cry,  
there are some who see it as proof that you didn't care anyhow, and when you do others 
see it as proof that you're too unstable to be a mom. I know how it changes silence from 
that sweet sound we longed for during times of turmoil, to that bitter reminder that the 
only we carried in our wombs and hearts for 9 months is not there.

I look around my small apartment. There is no room for a crib. I keep it cluttered. Mom 
thinks I'm just a slob when she comes to visit, but its because if I left a space, I'd 
know that's where my little one might have slept and I cannot face the pain. I look at 
the refrigerator and there are no little drawings stuck to it.  The floors have a bit of 
laundry strewn about, but there are no muddy handprints on the walls, no toys on the 
floor... there never have been... and I miss them.

And so, Little-Washu,  you and I occupy ourselves with other things, mostly our 
computers, and we pretend the pain isn't there and perhaps we can fool our minds and our 
bodies....

.. but our souls know better.
