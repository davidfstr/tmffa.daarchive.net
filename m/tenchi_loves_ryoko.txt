Ryoko
By Karlmarks 

----------Notes----------
   This is the final incarnation of The Votefic.  AHRLIs rejoice; your ship has come in.  Consider this my 
protest on behalf of legitimate authors everywhere.  Demonization and The Kill-Off may seem like 
reasonable solutions to the love triangle for about one second, but that's not the way to go.  Oh yeah, and I 
don't own the Tenchi Muyo franchise or characters.  Not that you'll find anyone remotely resembling them 
herein...
----------The Fic! ----------

   It was a normal day in the Masaki household.  But suddenly the peaceful air was shattered by a grating 
voice.  "Devil woman!  I'll teach you to mess with my Tenchi!" shouted Princess Aeka.  "Can't we just be 
friends?" Ryoko pleaded.  But it was of no use.  A ball of Jurai Power Energy shot toward the beautiful and 
infinitely powerful pirate.  Soon a fierce battle had erupted.  Then Sasami came in the room and served tea.  
Ryoko and Aeka stopped fighting and realized how much they meant to each other.  But then Aeka got sick 
and died.  Tenchi comforted Ryoko and discovered how he truly cared for her.  So they had sex.  Then they 
saved the universe with the power of true love and got married.  
            THE END

----------More Notes----------
   This was awful, I'll admit.  But it was awful writing with a pupose; the worst kind!  I've never written 
anything anywhere near this bad--in fact I'd like to take this opportunity to shamelessly promote my 
"critically acclaimed" Single Serving Tenchi and "unknown masterpiece" Perfect Circle.  Yay.  Doesn't 
that feel better?
My email is markskarl@hotmail.com .  Once again, I KNOW how awful this fic was.  I wrote it with that 
effect in mind.
And yes, I titled the fic "Ryoko" to scoop maybe 50 "Ryoko cuz shes kewl" votes on the TMFFA for 
myself!
