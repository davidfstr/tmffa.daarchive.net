It was a week since two girls, a mad scientist, a saiyan warrior and... well 
Carl, started their lives on the H.M.S. Hades Void. There was a great deal 
of giggling coming from the girls quarters, Libby and Katy had become quite 
good friends with Washu and had found out why she was subjecting them to the 
horror of fan fiction, they didn't understand the reason but, hey, at least 
they knew. The giggling was coming from Libby and Katy, they were playing 
Tequila battleship, for the second time. It was simple ordinary battleship 
rules but every time you hit the other persons battleship you drank a shot 
of tequila. Katy was winning.

Katy: B,8!
Libby(laughing): Hit! You're cheating come on let me have a lookie-poo!
Katy: Fuck off! * Pushes her away while squinting and trying valiantly to 
place a red tack into the "B,8" hole *

In the improved room across the hall the half of the blue walls were covered 
with Playboy centerfolds, Carl sat on his bed flicking through his XXX 
Magasines. Vegeta takes one look at him and leaves

Vegeta: Fucking Gimp!
Carl: Hey that's MR. Fucking Gimp to you!

Vegeta goes past the room with the crab on the door quickly and  soon 
arrives in the living room he sits down on the sofa and fics up the remote 
just as a loud disembodied voice boomed "FANFIC ALERT, PLEASE REPORT TO 
THEATRE ASAP"

A few moments later Vegeta and Carl walked into the thater followed by a 
cabbit and the two girls, leaning on each other and staggering.

Washu: Could you seperate those two please?
* they sit down in this order ((its important, we wouldn't be telling you if 
it wern't-Katy)) left to right Libby, Carl, Vegeta, Katy *
Katy:* Glomps Vegeta * Ha ha, I got Veggie and you got the wart! * sticks 
out her tounge at Libby *
Libby: Bitch!
Katy: Cow
Libby: Mooooooooooo * they both collapse into laughter *
Vegeta: * Pushes Katy away * Get the fuck offa me!
Carl: * runs over and starts hitting his head on the wall * why the hell did 
I start this in the first place!
Washu: Shuddup and watch!

What if Tenchi was American?

Katy: He'd be even more spineless and stupid that he already is!
Carl: He'll be saying FUCK a lot too.
Libby: The girls in that house would have been fucked by now!
Vegeta: * keeps trying to push Katy away * Damn, what the hell is wrong with 
me! This should be easy!
Katy(Laughing): You don't know much about women do you Veggie?

Another fucked up fic from the fucked up mind of

All: AAA-Phucknut! WASHUUUUUUUU????
Vegeta: Holy shit, a lemon!

AAA-PhuckNut

All: BOOOOOOO!

Disclaimer: The characters in this fic are the property of AIC and Pioneer, 
I make no claims to them. This fic looks at Tenchi's life if he was 
American. 
_______________________________________________________________________ Ahh, 
another normal day in the Masaki household in Tampa, Florida.

Katy: * snorts * What are they all old people now?
Vegeta: What do you mean? And get the fuck off me!
Libby: Everyone knows only old people live in Tampa!

Tenchi is just waking up at 11 a.m. "Arg... My fucking head... I gotta lay 
off the booze.."

All: Ahahahahahahaa
Carl: I FUCKING told you

said Tenchi very grogily. "OH TENCHI!!! Wake up my sexy Tenchi!!" said Ryoko 
as she jumped on top of Tenchi.

Libby: Score one to me!

"God dammit!! Would you get the fuck off me!! You always do that!!" yelled 
Tenchi. "Damn, calm the fuck down.. Im just trying to love you Tenchi."

Vegeta: No she's trying to Fuck you, run like you always do, please I don't 
want the lemon so soon I haven't managed to form a defence yet * Katy 
whispers something in his ear his eyes go wide and he starts struggling * 
Fucking hell get her outta here!
Washu: Sorry, no can do!

pouted Ryoko. "Ya well I dont have fucking time for it now." said Tenchi as 
he walked out of his room and headed down the stairs.

Carl: What about the rest of his body.
Vegeta: Was that a bad attempt at being dark?
* Carl nodds sadly *

Ryoko just sighed and then phased through the floor and headed into the 
kitchen. "Tenchi!! You finally woke up you lazy ass piece of shit!!" said 
Sasami

All: Sasami???

as Tenchi walked into the kitchen. "Lay the fuck off, my drunken ass didnt 
even go to bed till 4 a.m." said Tenchi angrily. "Well now that your up, get 
your sorry ass movin and go tell everyone its time for lunch, and hurry up 
cause I dont got fuckin time to waste!" said Sasami.

Veheta: Whats up with Sasami, surely all amercans aren't bad tempered as 
fuck!

"Stupid bitch Sasami..."

Carl: Don't dis the kid
Katy: Dis Me!
Libby: Dis yourself!
Vegeta: But don't dis the kid!

Tenchi mumbled as he walked out of the kitchen and passed by Ryoko. "What 
the fuck is wrong with him?" Ryoko asked Sasami as she got in the kitchen. 
"I fuckin told him to go get everyone for lunch, and I guess he's just being 
a fucking dick.."

Katy(Ryoko): He may be a dick but he aint got no balls.
Vegeta: * finally manages to pry Katy off him * Hey Washu! These two arnt 
funny when there pisse... * he is cut off when Katy kisses him. Washu 
presses a button in the projection room and Katy pulls away spitting on the 
floor *
Katy: EEEEEEEW Vegeta lips! Eew eew eew!
Libby: Ah shit my head.
Vegeta: Thank, fucking, god!

said Sasami. "Well Im fucking starving!! How much longer dammit!!" Ryoko 
blurted out. "As soon as everyone walks their happy ass'es and sits the fuck 
down then we can this dirty shit I call food."

Katy: Did she just say, We can this dirty shit I call food?
Carl: rewwinds a bit

the fuck down then we can this dirty shit I call food."

All: Yup!

Sasami said. "Well Im gonna go find Ryo-ohkie so it will go faster.." Ryoko 
said. "I wouldn't fuckin bother if I were you.." Sasami said. "And why the 
fuck is that?"

Cabbit: Oh god no!
Carl: Kiyo-Ohki? You can speak?
Kiyo-Ohki: Miya!

asked Ryoko. "Because Ryo-ohkie is what we are fucking eating!"

All: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Carl: Hey Kiyo-Ohki * he notices that Kiyo-Ohki is hiding under his seat and 
shaking in fear * aww I don't have the heart to.

said Sasami. "Oh ok.. well thats just one less fucking mouth to feed." said 
Ryoko.

Vegeta: no way would Ryoko say that!
Katy: This is so OOC I think they need new names

"Exactly." said Sasami. 
_______________________________________________________________________ 
Tenchi approached the shrine to get his grandfather Yosho to come to lunch, 
"Grandfather!" Tenchi yelled. No one responded.. "Hmm thats fucking odd, he 
must be really busy doing something."

Libby: I smell a lemon!
Katy: * drops the wedge halfway to her mouth * That's me sorry
* everyone stares at her weird. *
Katy: What? I like the taste of them!

Tenchi said to himself. Tenchi then walked into the shrine and he heard a 
noise, sounded like heavy breathing,

All: Holy mother of...
Katy: cabbits!

"Whats that wierd ass noise?"

Katy: In that sentence, ass, would be the operative word
Carl(ignoring Katy): Someone farting

said Tenchi. Tenchi walked into the office inside in the shrine and found 
his grandfather jacking off to a gay porno movie. "EWW Grandpa!! What the 
fuck are you doing you senile old bastard!!" beamed Tenchi.

Vegeta: Another misuse of the word "beamed" by Phucknut!

"Yo whats up Tenchi? Care to join me in a gay orgy?"

Katy: HIT THE DECK!

asked Yosho. "No you sick fucking prick!!

All: Horaaaay!
Katy(singing): Celebrate good times, come on! Do do do do do do do do, ow 
wow!

Just come to lunch you fag!!" said Tenchi. "Why are you acting so fucking 
suprised? You weren't suprised last night when you were drunk and I was 
fucking Noboyuki in the ass."

Carl: Mother of god, mother of god, mother of god, mother of god, mother of 
god...
Katy: I did not need to know that!
* Carl's eyes turn red and his head slowly spins*
Carl: Tenchimuyou, as one word, is Japanese for "This side up".
* Carl's feet explode *
Vegeta: What the fuck?
* Carl goes back to normal as his feet regenerate *


said Yosho. "You fucked dad?!?" questioned a suprised Tenchi. "Uh yaaaa... 
What the fuck has this world come to?? A man can't even have sex with his 
son-in-law anymore.."

Vegeta: And if I have anything to say about it it'll stay that way!

said Yosho. "Ok just shut the fuck up.. this is getting wierd.."

Libby: True, true!

said Tenchi. Tenchi then left and headed back to the house and went to the 
kitchen. 5 minutes later everyone else showed up, "About fucking time 
everyone got here.." said Sasami. "Just shut up bitch, and give us our 
fucking food" said Ayeka.

Vegeta: and more OOC by the second!

"Ya you little slut, stop bitching and give us our god damned food" said 
Noboyuki. "Why dont you just pull your penis out of your ass and shut your 
damn mouth."

All: Yeah!

Sasami said to Noboyuki. "My penis isnt in my ass, Yosho's is."

Katy: If I've told ya once I've told ya a million times! I don't want to 
know!
All; Neither do I

Noboyuki said. "Figures.." said Ryoko. "You people are so fucking annoying.. 
Im going to the mall." said Tenchi. Tenchi then left and hopped into his 
Honda Civic V-TEC, put on Rollin by Limp Bizkit and blasted his stereo and 
headed out to the mall.

Libby: At least the music's not as bad as the fic.
Katy: too right!
Vegeta: This is mild for a Phucknut, just be lucky you didn't get something 
like "Tenchi on a plate of Sashimi" * he and Carl shudder *
Libby: That bad?
Carl: * sounding traumatised * and so much worse!
_______________________________________________________________________ 
Tenchi was so sick of his life, he just wanted to kill everyone in his 
house.

Vegeta(cheerfully): if he did that the fic would end!
All(chanting): Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!

While he walked around the mall he formulated the plan. He would go the 
hobby store and buy some chemicals and make a nice little pipe bomb and blow 
all his friends and family to hell, where they all belong.

All: Horaaaaaaaaaay

_______________________________________________________________________ 
Tenchi acquired all the supplys he needed, and as he was walking out of the 
mall, he saw that bitch sakuya.

Vegeta: Uh oh!
Libby: What?
Vegeta: Phucknut has two hoobys, writing fanfics that make people spew and 
killing Sakuya in vivid and horible detail.
Libby: Uh oh!
Vegeta: My words exactly

"HI TENCHI!!" screamed Sakuya as she ran towards Tenchi. "Oh great.. not 
this fucking bitch again.." Tenchi mumbled to himself. "hey Tenchi whats 
up?" asked Sakuya once she got to Tenchi. "Nothing really... I got something 
to tell you." said Tenchi. "Ive been calling you and you still haven't 
called me back yet!" said Sakuya. "Thats what I wanted to say.." said 
Tenchi. "Oh thats ok Tenchi theres no need to apologize, I still love you!" 
said Sakuya happily. "Well you see, If you would just fucking listen, Im not 
apologizing to you because I think your an anoying bitch and I deliberatly 
didnt call you. Now just leave me the fuck alone." said Tenchi. Sakuya just 
stood there stunned and a tear rolled down her cheek as Tenchi left the 
mall. 
_______________________________________________________________________ 
Sakuya left the mall to run home and cry, she was so busy thinking of Tenchi

Vegeta: And it begins! ((God my English teacher would kill me if she saw 
that!-Katy))

that as she ran she didnt notice the 20 ton Mack truck headed right for her. 
The trucker hit his brakes, but then he noticed that the girl looked like 
that Sakuya character on one of the animes that trucker watched. "Hey thats 
the Sakuya girl from Shin Tenchi!!" said the trucker. "I hate that FUCKING 
BITCH!!" screamed the trucker as he slammed on the gas. The truck slammed 
right into Sakuya's side with the force of a nuclear bomb detonating 
inbetween your legs. Sakuya's body was just splattered all over the front of 
the truck as the trucker drove away laughing hysterically.

Katy: So he murdered someone because he thought she looked like and anime 
charicter. Holy shit! Screwed up fucker!

_______________________________________________________________________ 
Tenchi got home and went straight to his room to start work on his bomb. 
"Its about fucking time you got back Tenchi!" said Ayeka. "Back off bitch, I 
have work to do." said Tenchi as he passed by Ayeka. Tenchi made his pipe 
bomb and taped nails all around the outside of it for maximum killing 
effect,

* all sit in raptured silence, Carl is taking notes *

then he stuck a 10 second fuse out one end of it..

Carl(mumbling): Where do you buy a ten second fuse
* everyone moves away from him *

"Ah finally all fucking done!" beamed a proud Tenchi.

Katy: It's a miracle  Phucknut used beamed in its proper context!
All: Alleluia, Alleluia!

Tenchi then headed out to the living room and taped the bomb to the bottom 
of the center table, then he called everyone into the room. "Everyone get 
the fuck in the living room! I have something to say!" yelled Tenchi. After 
everyone arrived Tenchi lit the bomb under the table so no one noticed, 
"Shit wait one sec, I forgot something." said Tenchi as he ran up into his 
room. "I wonder what the fuck this is about?" asked Ayeka "I dont kn" was 
all Sasami managed to say before the bomb exploded sending speeding nails 
into their bodys. Tenchi came back down after hearing the explosion and 
snickered when he saw all their mangled bodys lying all over the place.

Vegeta: Did he just do that?
* Katy just nods *
_______________________________________________________________________ 
Tenchi thought he had gotten away with this, but the police found out and 
arrested Tenchi. He was sent to a maximum security prison where he was anal 
raped by a fat black man named Butch.

* Carl shudders *
_______________________________________________________________________ THE 
END Well how did you like it? Some of you may disagree when these 
"americans" cuss so much.. well the talk in my family sounds just like it 
does in this fic :P I know it wasnt very "american" like for Tenchi to 
murder everyone, but I had to end this fic somehow!! PLus he suffered an 
"american" punishment when he was arrested! :P Send all comments to:

Everyone leaves the theatre and goes to bed. The next morning they wake up 
to the smell of something cooking. Carl walked into the girls room and 
handed Katy a bowl of small yellow balls in yellow sauce.

Katy: What the hell is this?
Carl: Breakfast.
Katy: I am not eating that shit! Where'd you get the recipe
Carl: From my cookbook.
Katy: Called...
Carl: "Akane's kitchen of pain!"

Katy proceeds to frog march Carl to the door throw him out and throw the 
bowl of goo on top of him.

Katy: Take that Buttmunch!
Carl: * yellow and dripping * That's MR. Buttmunch to you!

Just the...
Voice: THIS IS THE FANFIC WARNING PLEASE ENETR THE THEATER AND BRACE 
YOURSELVES!

Katy: Holy shit, that sounds bad!


All enter the theatre and sit down.

It occured to me that Kagato never got his revenge on Tenchi and the others 
for his defeat. Here now is the continuing saga of the evil space villain 
Kagato..... KAGATO'S REVENGE by Washu 6/10/97 
_________________________________________________________________________ It 
was a beautiful spring day and Ryo-ohki was bounding through the carrot 
patch with cheerful meows for everyone. Tenchi was busy shovelling dirt for 
the new vegitable patch. Sasami and Mihoshi were planting seed in the 
freshly hoed rows of dirt. Sasami looked up from her work and wipped
Carl: AARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH THE S&M HAS ALREADY BEGUN!
her brow. She took a moment to survey the day's accomplishments. She watched 
Tenchi on the far side of the field. He was busy digging. Off in one corner 
of the garden, Ryoko and Aeka were having a screaming match. Sasami sighed. 
So what else is new? she thought. Ryo-ohki hopped up with a fresh carrot in 
her mouth. "Meow, meow, meow!!!" she said loudly. Sasami looked down and 
frowned. "Have you been eating the fresh carrots again Ryo-Ohki?" Tenchi 
won't be very happy about that pleased
Vegeta: Oh god it doesn't even make sense!
. Ryo-Ohki looked at her forlornly. Suddenly, a dark shadow loomed above 
their heads. Everyone looked up to see a giant spacecraft hovering over the 
field. Without warning, a blast of green light engulfed them all. Tenchi 
yelled out Sasami's name. It was the last thing that Sasami heard before she 
lost conciousness.... Sasami awoke with a start. Her head was spinning and 
she felt dazed. She was lying on her back, strapped securely to an operating 
table.
All: oh shit!
Katy: HIT THE DECK!
When she tried to move her arms, they wouldn't budge. She looked around the 
room in terror, trying to make sense of her predicament. The room was large 
and white like an operating room. She was confused and desperately tried to 
free her hands. Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room. "Well Sasami, it 
seems that I will have my revenge at last!" Sasami recognized Kagato's cruel 
and evil voice. She looked around the room in terror and confusion. A 
heartless laugh reverberated through the room. "I've been waiting for you 
Sasami..." Kagato cackled. "I've been so looking forward to our next 
encounter!" Sasami was terrified. She squirmed and strained against the 
strong clamps that held her wrists and ankles to the table. A huge screen 
descended from the ceiling. On it was as taunting image of Kagato's face. 
His evil glare looked down at her from above. "Now you can see me watching 
you little one!" he grinned "You will be able to see the joy in my face as I 
submit your young body to HELL!"
* the MSTers are hiding behind there seats *
Kagato touched a button and his image was replaced by a mirror reflection of 
Sasami clamped to the table. "See how pretty you are my dear?" he said with 
a sarcastic grin. "You can see absolutely everyting that is happening to 
you." Without warning, the wall at her left opened up and a cluster of evil 
looking machinery slid forth from the darkness. The mechanical nightmare 
hummed to life as Kagato pushed the buttons on his controller madly. Sasami 
gasped in horror as she watched metallic tentacles writh and twitch as the 
machinery unfolded above her. Silvery metal tentacles
* Vegeta sticks his head over the seat *
Vegeta: Shit there's tentacles out there
* everyone screams *
Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles 
Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles 
Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles 
Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles Silvery metal tentacles 
Silvery metal tentacles...
* everyone sticks there heads ups*
Carl: whats going on
Voice: FANFIC TOO BAD, 
PROOOOGGGGGGGEEEEEECCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR
BRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOKEEEEEEEEEEN
All the lights go out.
Well that was it the third MST by us, well I did most of this by myself 
since noone would help me that's why it isn't as good as usual, plus I'm 
shattered, I feel like I haven't slept for a week-Katy
Oh by the way the Wart says bye too
