    This is a REALLY short story about Washu getting Tenchi. I just wrote it
for fun, I hope you all like it! ^^ Since there are not many fanfics where
Washu gets Tenchi, I thought I'd just write Washu getting Tenchi…the
simple
way.

It starts…

    An adorable little genius named Washu. A tall, dark, and semi-handsome
guy named Tenchi. Tenchi sees Little Washu. Little Washu sees Tenchi. Both
stare for a long period of time. Eyes turn to hearts. Tenchi and Little
Washu
kiss. Tenchi and Little Washu get engaged. Tenchi and Little Washu run off
to
Vegas. Tenchi and Little Washu elope. Tenchi and Little Washu stay at a
hotel
for a few nights…you don't wanna know what happens next. Tenchi and Little
Washu get bored with themselves for nine months. Tenchi and Washu punch out
a
couple of kids. Tenchi and Little Washu watches little babies grow into
little kids. Tenchi and Little Washu watch little kids grow into big kids.
Tenchi and Little Washu watch big kids grow to adults. Tenchi and Little
Washu get old. Tenchi and Little Washu become grandparents. Tenchi and
Little
Washu croak. The end.

    Tenchi Muyo! And characters (even though there is only one other) are
not
owned by me. They are property of Pioneer and AIC, and I say again, I do not
own them. And because of this I beg you, please do NOT sue me, thank you
very
much! ^^;
