Side MST #1.

By: Jim Ohki.

The USS Millennium Eagle zipped through the cosmos, going from point A to point 
B.  Her Captain, Jim Ohki, was trying to do a ton of stuff at the same time.  
Writing a popular fic, Transformations, on fanfiction.net, MSTing all of the 
MSTs that Peter Suzuki has ever done, forming the MST Syndicate*, as well as 
writing a joint MST with the Captain of the Icedrake, Mike.  And then he decides 
to start a side series of MSTs, beginning with this fic here . . .

Captain's Ready room . . .

Tenchi cast: "DAMN IT JIM!  Why are you putting MORE work on us?!"
Jim: "Because I feel we need a change of pace . . . Peter just had to MST the 
longest fics out there, even if it was by chapter . . . or do you want to go 
back to MSTing Aikan Muyo AGAIN . . ."
All: "NO!  THIS IS FINE!"
Ash: "What about the joint MST?"
Jim: "I'm waiting for Mike to get back to me on that one . . . basically, this 
is MSTing something different, without seeing the same material every other 
page.  Now then, into the theatre!"

The MSTers pile into the turbolift, and head for theatre one . . .

MSTers:
Jim, Mihoshi Ohki and Chi-Chi: The Captain and his women . . . well, Chi-Chi 
will be in and out, she's watching the kids.
Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko Masaki: The Prince and his women . . . well, Ryoko will 
be in and out, she's sick.
Ash and Misty Ketchum: The PokeMon Master and his wife . . . they don't have 
anything special going on.

Tenchi: "So, what is this marvelous piece that we are doing today?"
Jim: "'Journey of Eternity - Chapter 1 : "The Journey Begins"'.  Why in the 
world the author didn't put a title or disclaimer up here is beyond me . . ."

>It is a moonless, starless night at the Masaki household, all is still
>and everyone is sleeping.

Jim: "What is this?  Is it cloudy, or has the Universe turned off the lights?"
Tenchi (operator for Power Company): "We're sorry, but your bill hasn't been 
paid for two billion years.  We have no choice but to discontinue your service."
Ash (Universe): "NO!  PLEASE NO!  PEOPLE WON'T KNOW IF IT'S DAY OR NIGHT 
ANYMORE!  CHAOS WILL REIN SUPREME!"
Tenchi (operator): "I'm sorry, but until you pay, no power for you!" (hangs up)

>A dark, shadowy figure is then seen in the sky.  The figure flys to the Masaki 
>house and lands at the front door.  The figure is seen as a young woman looking 
>Ryoko's age.

Misty: "Now wait a minute here . . . if it's a moonless, starless night, how in 
the hell is anybody going to see ANYTHING?"
Ash: "High power spot lights do the trick."
Ryoko: "I DO NOT look my age, ass munch.  I am several thousand years old, and I 
look twenty."
 
>Her hair is shadowy black and she has green, menacing eyes.  She
>wears a long, black velvet dress, cut close to her breasts,
>reaveiling a little of her tan skin.  She carries a large sack, she
>then "shimmers" as if she was a shadow and walks through the
>wall.

Mihoshi: "What the hell is that?  Cut close to her breasts?  Does Lio mean a low 
cut dress, or that somebody got too happy with the chainsaw?"
Jim (fires up his Homelite 240 Chainsaw): "YEAH!" (imitates Tim Allen, screaming 
like a madman, running at the audience)
Ash (not paying any attention): "And how does a shadow shimmer?  I know Ryoko 
can phase through walls without the wavy effect and all . . . JESUS CHRIST! 
(jumps to the side) WATCH IT WITH THAT THING, JIM!"

>The woman creeps along the floor looking for her victum, Tenchi.  She walks up 
>the stairs to Tenchi's room and stars at him.  Tenchi then wakes up to see a 
>beautiful, but evil space woman standing over him 

Ryoko: "Nothing new there, I bet."
Ayeka: "Wow, for a short fic, there's only four spelling errors so far.  Not 
bad."
Jim: "Did I fail to mention that this has a lemon flavor?"
Rest: "JIM!" >_<
Jim: "Sorry." ~_~*
 
>Tenchi:Who are...

Misty: "Okay, since when is this in script format?"
Ryoko: "Like the MSTs that we do?  I dunn . . ." (suddenly bolts out of the 
theatre for a toilet)
Tenchi: "Nothing like an alien getting the flu."
Chi-Chi (walks in, yawning): "Not that I'm complaining, but why do I have to 
watch the kids?"
Jim: "Because you're the only one here with that much experience.  Mihoshi and I 
needed a parent break anyway."
Ayeka: "And I refuse to subject my son to these pieces of crap."
Chi-Chi: "Fair enough for Ayeka.  Jim, Mihoshi . . . well, I don't mind, but you 
two do need more experience." (She walks back out)
 
>The woman covers his mouth and stuffs him in the sack, she then
>tries to sneak away but steps through a green lazer sensor,
>sounding an alarm.  At that moment Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami and
>Washu show up.

Jim: "Wow, instantaneous transport caused by alarm system . . . sounds like that 
gadget Washu put on Tenchi's door."
Ayeka: "Well, at least it 'beamed' us to Tenchi, and not out into the lake."
Tenchi: "Hey now, in the summer time, I enjoyed it when you or Ryoko got dunked 
. . . think wet T-shirt contest."
Jim and Ash: (drool)
 
>Ayeka: You put Lord Tenchi down this instant you...you... hey who
>are you anyway!

Jim: "Ah, the all important question.  WHO ARE YOU?!"
Ayeka: "Oh come on, I woulda thrown an insult out at this bitch . . . see, I 
just did . . ."
Misty: "Yeah, and Ryoko is attack first, ask questions never."
Tenchi: "You have a point there . . ."
 
>Ryoko: Yeah, state your name or i'll just have to force it outta
>you!

Misty: "See, I told you.  Although, she did DEMAND first before attacking . . . 
how very odd . . ."
Tenchi: "Bah.  Ayeka's just rubbing off on her."
Jim (jumps away, to the other side of the theatre): "DON'T YOU MEAN GETTING OFF 
ON HER?!"
Ayeka: (summons her mini-guardians)
Jim: "COMPUTER! DELTA, NINER, TANGO, FOXTROT!" (Ayeka's shield units vanish, 
followed by a minute of silence.  And then the silence is broken by the 
appearance of Eva 01.)
Shinji (no Mike, not 10 o'clock): "AN ANGEL!  I THOUGHT WE KILLED THEM ALL! 
NNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!"
Jim: "Whoops . . . guess my experimental Absolute Terror Field got your 
attention.  Well, you're more than welcome to MST a fic with us . . . where'd he 
go?"
 
>Woman: Ooh, I'm shaking in my jetboots, like you could hurt me!

Ayeka: "WE COULD!"
 
>Sasami: You make me really mad lady, so hand over Tenchi or... or,
>I'm gonna have to hurt you!

All: O_O! "SASAMI?!"
 
>Woman: Not that It'll help you, but i am Dianea, and not only that,
>but I'm going.  See ya!!!

All: Pfffft.  >_<* "What's that smell?"
 
>Dianea flies off forgetting to shimmer and she breaks a hole in the
>roof, she disapeers from beyond the farthest star.

Jim: "AH HA!  SO THE STARS WERE OUT!"
Ash (universe bit again): "I HAVE THE POWER!"
Tenchi: "In America, first you get the money, then you get the power, then you 
get the women."
 
>Ryoko and Ayeka: Tenchi!

>Sasami: Oh no Tenchi's gone, and we don't know where to!

Tenchi: "Yeah right.  Although I can feel the love, I know for a fact Ryoko 
wouldn't just stand around."
Jim: "Doesn't your head hurt, Tenchi?"
Tenchi: "No.  Why?"
Jim: "Well, you were just flown through the roof of your house the hard way."
Rest: O_O "OUCH!"
 
>Washu: Oh girls, I think i can help this little problem.  Follow me to
>my laboratory. 
 
>All of the girls follow Washu to a gigantic computer.

Ayeka: "THRILL, AS THE LACK OF DETAILS PUTS US TO SLEEP!"
All: (sound asleep)
 
>Washu: Find all data availiable on Dianea.
 
>The computer screen flashes with colored squares, soon reveiling a
>picture of Dianea and a discription.
 
>Ayeka:(Reading from the screen) Dianea is a wanted criminal, with
>little known about her.  She has been seen flying form various
>planets to section 4356 of the Cinton galaxie, the outer
>regions. (looks confused) Washu, what does this mean!
 
>Washu: Well the computer shows that she is seen flying around
>section 4356 better known as the small planet of Tarades.
 
>At that moment Ryoko freezes, everyone can sense that she
>knows something.
 
>Sasami: Ryoko, what do you know about this planet?  Ryoko, tell
>us, they took Tenchi!
 
>Ryoko: Well, um you see, way back when I was partners with the
>ruler of that planet.  Her name was Hecate.  She was better known
>as the Mistress of Shadows, and by men the Mistress of Lust.

All: (chose this moment to wake up)
Jim: "Mistress of Lust?  That's a lemon setup if I've ever seen one."
Tenchi: "Yeah.  At least the lemon you wrote kinda left people in the dark until 
the lemon scene."
Jim: "HEY!  I wasn't very good then.  Just you wait until the Transformations 
story gets into your universe."
 
>Ayeka: And this...lustful shadow woman has Lord Tenchi.  Who
>knows what she could to to him...or worse with him!  Washu, we
>have to get him back.

Ash: "Watch out for Echo Canyon."
Misty: "Lame, DumbAsh."
Rest: "DumbAsh?  Did she get censored?"
 
>Washu: Well Ayeka, we do have a ship...Reoh-ohke, and Ryoko can
>be our guide, map, guru...whatever, she can help us find the way.

Jim: "All right, that's enough.  I can let it slide misspelling 'flies' and 
'galaxy'.  But Ryo-Ohki?  Nope.  You, Sir, need to learn the use of the spell 
check . . ."
Tenchi: "Jim, settle down."
Jim: "I will NOT!  NOTHING GETS ME MADDER THEN WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T LOOK THIS SHIT 
UP, AND SPELL IT RIGHT!" (goes into limit break mode, becoming a Dark Jedi) 
"YYYYAAAARRRRHHHHGGGG!!!!" (attacks the screen, then the other MSTers with his 
lightsaber)
Mihoshi: "Ah HELL!  HE'S GONE BERSERK!  WE NEED NAKED WOMEN IN HERE, PRONTO!" 
(gets naked while being chased)
Ryoko: (finally walked back in just after Jim had flipped his lid, also gets 
naked)
Ayeka: "HELL NO!  I WON'T DO IT!" (dives to the right, and the pony tail on the 
left gets lobbed off)
Rest (even Jim): O_O! "Oh *SHIT*!" (run to the far side of the theatre)
Ayeka (grows to apartment building size, breathing nuclear fire): "MY HAIR!!"
 
>All Girls: Lets go!

Rest: "NO SHIT!" (run away from Ayeka)

>    ~*~*~*Meanwhile on planet Tarades With Tenchi*~*~*~
                             
>Dianea has just arrived with Tenchi still in the sack.  She lands just
>before a big black palace.  At her command the two doors open
>and she walks down the hall to the royal chamber.

All (minus Ayeka): (running away from the Princess turned Godzilla)
Ayeka: (lets out the loudest Godzilla shriek in the arsenal, sending fire at 
everybody else)
 
>Dianea:(talking to Tenchi in the sack) Hecate is going to be so
>pleased with me when I bring her you.  Imagine, a real Jurai prince.
 
>Dianea reaches the royal chambers, she stares up onto a throne. 
>Upon the throne sits a tall, slender, shapley woman.  She is
>wearing a black boustea (strapless bra) with a gold jewel
>connecting the two sides.  She also wears a long black wrap-skirt
>with a golden roping belt.  Her hair is jetblack nad she has cold,
>blue eyes and pale milky-white skin.

Jim: "NEVER AGAIN!  I don't care how much the spelling gets to me, I can't have 
GODZILLA running around my theatre!" (dives to the right, avoiding an airborne 
chair)
Mihoshi (still naked, GP blaster in hand, hiding behind the snack counter): 
"DAMN IT!  MY PACK IS DEAD!  I NEED A NEW CLIP!"
Ryoko (up in the rafters, naked): "JESUS CHRIST!  Just how strong is she now?!"
Misty: (knocked out on the third trip around the theatre, and is still 
unconscious)
Ash: (inadvertently lets out a five minute fart.  While doing so, he starts 
laughing, making the fart sound the same.  Ayeka-Godzilla tries to flame Ash, 
and ignites the HUGE amount of methane in the air, roasting everybody)
Ayeka: (returns to normal, roasted like a peanut)
All: "OUCH!"

>Dianea: Hello your highness, my rule Hecate.  I have for you a gift,
>a man.  He's not like the others, he's a native Jurain Prince, raised
>on Earth!  

Jim: "How can he be a native of Jurai, when he was born on Earth?"
Tenchi: "It's called 'I've-never-seen-the-entire-series-itis'.  Proof of what 
happens when people DON'T watch the entire thing through and through."
Ayeka: "You've been hanging out with Washu, haven't you?"
 
>Hecate: Well then, I'll just have to try him out.  Let him out of the
>sack Dianea, then stand back.
 
>Dianea unties the sack and lets Tenchi out.

All: "BORING!"
 
>Tenchi: Why am I here, who are you.

Ryoko: "Ah, yet another author who uses the question marks for curtain hangers."
Ash: "Ah, yes.  Gotta shade the monitor, so you CAN'T see what you're doing."
 
>Hecate: I'm Hecate the ruler of this planet.  It's called Tarades
>otherwise known as the Shadow planet.  And you are here for me
>to enjoy.
 
>Tenchi: Oh no, I will not lay with you.

All: O_O! "He picked up on innuendo?!"
 
>Hecate: Well, then I'll just force you, I've done it before.  Dianea
>take him to my bed chamber, I'll be in soon.
 
Jim: "Well, this fic was in the lemon section, and yet, no lemon . . ."
All: "YAY!"

All: (Run out of the theatre as fast as possible, for Sasami had made a HUGE 
dinner for the crew . . . with help from Chi-Chi, of course)

There it is people.  The return of the Millennium Eagle MSTs.  These side MSTs 
are a distraction for the crew, as I come up with new material.

*MST Syndicate is my response to fanfiction.net banning MSTs.  For more info,

I'll be back . . .
