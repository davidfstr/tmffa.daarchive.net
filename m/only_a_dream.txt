Only a Dream

It happened around...last November, I had bought my first Tenchi video tape
(1st shinTenchi) I was completely revolted at the cruddy story, but had a
strange liking to the badguys....It was 10:00 and I decided to go to sleep,
little did I know I should have stayed up all night...

*************

"Wake up......please....."
I heard a voice, it was my best friend (I will refer him to Diaborromon)
"Uh, I'm up Diaborromon" I said dully.  I got up and noticed that I wasn't
in
my room, I was in what seemed to be a very thick fog bank.
"H-h-how did we get here?" I asked.
"I don't know," Diaborromon said, "I just woke up and here I am too."
"Hmmmhmmmm"
Diaborromon suddenly tackled me to the ground.
"Did you hear that?" he snapped.
"W-what?" I asked.
"HmmhmmhmmhmmhmmHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Holy(censored)! someone's in the cloud bank with us!" Diaborromon yelled.
We both saw a figure start moving twoards us, whatever it was, it had spikes
on it's shoulders and a cylinder for a head.
"Um"
"Um what?"
"RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
But something wasn't right, it seemed that the faster we went, so did the
figure.
"Cccccccccccooooooooommmmmmmmeee herrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre." The figure said.
"Hey that sounded like one of the badguys from ShinTenchi!" Diaborromon
said.
I was right, because before we could do anything, the baddie shot at us with
a blue beam. I flew into the air, suddenly everything revolved around me,
suddenly, well (Puh-lese remember this is a dream on ShinTenchi)
I shrank, about to Three feet, ten inches, my hair grew out, some kind of
metalic cloak surounded my body, my voice became squeaky, I lost controll of
my body,I suddenly yelled out......
"Well it looks like I win again!
HEHHEHHEHHAHHAHHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
**************
I woke up in a cold sweat, that's the reason why I HAVE to like Yugi.

Scary huh? O_o

That was my fourth (Short) story
