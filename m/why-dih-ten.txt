This is my first attempt at a Misc.  My attempts at X-overs wasn't going
well, so I'm taking a shot at this.
Disclamer:  Come on now?!?  By now you should know that I own Kiyone and
Mihoshi (^_; , just kidding...)
Also, I dont own Missy Elliot.

Why dont I have Tenchi?
by
Kiyone "Kaze" Mabiki Featuring Lil 'Miho

Same old show, same old flow
You say you want to be with me
Let me tell you something
...Tenchi's the man for me
I've lived (I've lived) with Aeka and Ryoko
This story I told, I will vocal
How do you expect me
To believe your better than Tenchi?

Why don't I have Tenchi?  (Why don't I have him?)
So I can leave Mihoshi... (So she can leave...)
And get a raise from G.P.? (Get a raise, get a raise)
Cause all girls need Tenchi (Girl like me needs Tenchi)

Guys are guys
Guys are cheap
You say your different
Well then , prove it to me
I know Tenchi aint the same
I lived with him once
He showed me everyday
(Aeka, Ryoko) leave with your game
I won't be seeing you ever again
Wherever you go, remember me
I'm the best thing for Tenchi

Now I have Tenchi (Now I have...have)
But I still have Mihoshi (I still have Mihoshi)
And no raise from G.P. (Still no raise...raise)
Cause a girl need Tenchi (Girl like me...I need Tenchi)

Second Time
Moved you in, took you back
To my life (I needed you)
I don't know if you see
This time
You and I, just one life
Forever (ooh...ooh yeah)

Its just me and Tenchi...
Without Mihoshi...
Got the raise from G.P. ...
Cause Kiyone needs Tenchi!

The End....or is it?!?

That took longer than I thought it would.  Feel free to send me
e-mails! (only ones by cuties that look like Kiyone/Mihoshi/Ryoko/Aeka, now
Sasami look-likes---just kidding again!)
