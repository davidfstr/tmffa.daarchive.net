Disclaimer: Tenchi and all associated
with it (well, mostly) is property
or AIC and Pioneer.
All other Anime shows, references
and characters mentioned in this 
song are not my property,
but property of their original 
creators and publishers.
"The Rock Show" is by Blink 182
and if you didn't know that you
know even less about music than
me.

NOTES: No, this is not STRICTLY Tenchi
but it is about Anime in general.
I suppose I could've put it on ff.net 
but I know the tmffa is reliable and in
any case I have still to make my mark
(or any kind of mark) there.
Well, that said I hope no one is
dissapointed that it isn't pure Tenchi
and can enjoy it:

		    "The Expo"

Dressing up, make up and hair like a Saiyan
I couldn't wait for that summer at Fanime
My eye caught hers- I nearly got a nosebleed
She's getting perved on cos her skirt's one inch long
And her mates are too, people think their sluts but 
their wrong
Their just otakus, hot for the Gundam
She said hi and I knew she was the one

Cause I fell in love with the girl at the expo
Hair light blue and spiked like Ryoko
Big blue eyes like my favourite Miho
Everything an anime fan could dream to know
'cept shes not a lesbian- at least I don't think so
I fell in love with the girl at the expo
 
When we said we were gonna train with the Buddhists
And move to Japan they just stared at us
17 with a boxed set of DVDs
We know we're lame - we're hooked on Animes

Cause I fell in love with the girl at the expo
Breasts like Rei and I am her Heero
Bullets and leather just like Konoko
Everything's techniclour when she's around
She says she loves me, I facefault to the ground
I fell in love with a girl at the expo

Black and colour sketches of her in my books
Capturing that look, she always gives when she's kissing
And if I ever get the chance, I'll write us a Manga romance
Because it keeps us wishing

Cause I fell in love with the girl at the expo
We spend 80 pounds a week on hair gel
We'll be together- an inseperable Duo
She doesn't mind when I touch her Sailor Uranus
We're gonna write fanfics till we become famous
I fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
Fell in love with the girl at the expo
I'll never forget her hair

THE END

Not bad, not bad.
I've been meaning to do this one for ages-
and I'm quite pleased with it.
Ah well, let me know what you thought if 
only with a couple of lines.
Yrs.
