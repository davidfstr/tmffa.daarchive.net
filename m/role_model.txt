Skit:
Tenchi:   How ya' doin', Shinji?!
Shinji:   Chillin'-chillin...
Tenchi:   Eyyo!  Happy Birthday, man!
Shinji:   Yo...  Thanks...
Tenchi:   I gotta surprise for ya!

[Tenchi leads his friend to the next room...  Where Shinji's father, Gendo,
is tied up,  hanging on the ceiling, and surrounded by all the characters
from Evangelion and Tenchi Muyo ready to play "Pin`ata" with him.]

[Song Starts]
[Tenchi]
You battle-rap; thought you could handle this
But then you turned around and screamed 
	"DAMN THAT'S A WHOLE LOTTA CANNABIS!!"
You couldn't handle the truth if it was so simple
Like you practice the mental arts at the Juraian Temple
I got beef.  You got milk, then equal me
You still write rhymes about doing thing illegally
And y'all still collect Sasami porno
Poor girl had fell and hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
[Aeka: OH NO!!] So tell your kids not to do drugs
One day Ryoko got dazed, and flopped us like rugs
I treat the girls nice and feed 'em "sunny sherbert"
While you scrubs get slapped and get labled a pervert 
	[Mihoshi: HENTAI!!]
Peace to Rivals, my main man Edge
Had a fight with Nagi.  The both of them bleed [Nagi: Ow!  OW!]
Nice stories 'bout the girls going lez.
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
Work at a shrine, practice alien powers
Write lemons that keep Tenchi fans up for hours? [Nobuyuki's snoring...] 
Kiyone's my type; she doesn't make me ill
But Sakuya's got that thing like Lauryn Hill [Both girls: PICK ME!!]
See that I'm Japanese, ignorin' skills
"Brillo-Pad-Head's" what it says on the bill.
Ryoko disappears like she was in a mist
How can she be an alien?  She doesn't even exist
Thumbs up to Misao.  Girl's kinda brave [Pixy Misa says some French...]
Pixy Misa helped Pretty Sammy out of a cave
Ryoko's middle finger won't go down when she waves
You want her to teach li'l Mayuka how to behave? [Aeka: No!]

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
I broke the law, got arrested by Mitsuki
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
When things blow up, I leave immediately
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
Nagi kicked everyone's ass in VG (Variable Geo)
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!

Me, Shinji, and Trakal were at "Hard Gold"
Got the drinks, celebrate the 22 years old
Met a girl who's a friend of Trakal's uncle
And drove the lady longer than a white Ford Bronco [Trakal: He did it.]
I'm a shrine clerk.  How can I be a jerk?
It was Washuu that caused your Eva to go beserk
And finally destroy the ozone layer [Washuu: OOPS!!]
Cross over my heart saying "I'm not a player"
My rap style's compared to a Star Wars Jedi
Ryoko's style worsens when she downs a quart of "Red Eye"
You wanna war?  C'mon!  Talk to me! [Kiyone & Nagi jeering him on]
I'll speed the knowledge up in your Kuno Tatewaki
Attack Ranma, to China I'll send 'em back [Kuno: I'll Smite Thee!]
Then feed Akane her own cooking with no EX-LAX!!
My mom was so pretty...  It's a pity
Me and my dad...   NO, WAIT!  THIS AIN'T THE QUICKIES!!
Can someone please explain to Mihoshi's brain
That the loss of Washuu's machine is causing her some pain?
Don't have the guts to say, "You're driving me nuts"
But I have the guts to stab Kagato up into his butt [Ryoko: DANG!!]
So when I drop the bomb, check the thermometer 
	[Ryo-Ouki: Myah-myah...]
And check your cabbit 'cause there might be something wrong with her
When you drop a solo hit, it's over with
When we drop ours it's 26 eps and we're cold with it

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
Ryoko killed the jerks working on "Scream 3"
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
Sasami's as popular as (Rei) Ayanami!
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?!
We're all now on vacation.  Call AIC!!
Y'all don't wanna grow up to be just like me!!
