Don't Speak

Note: I do not own Tenchi Muyo or the song "Don't
Speak." I'm not making money by writing this fic so
don't sue me.

Ryoko sat on the floor of her old cave, tears filling
her eyes.

You and me
We used to be together
Everday together always.

She whispered his name in the dark. "Tenchi-sama."
Her love. Her only one.

I really feel that I'm losing my best friend
I can't believe this could be the end.

He had told her he didn't love her. Oh, she wished he
did.

It looks as though you're letting go.
And if it's real I don't want to know.

All her life she had spent looking for answers.
Tenchi had almost been her reason for living, but not
anymore.

Don't Speak. I know just what your saying.
So please stop explaining.
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.
Don't sp eak. I know what your thinking
And I don't need your reasons.
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.

Another tear rolled to the ground, her heart was so
full of pain it didn't even feel good to cry. "I
don't love you, Ryoko!" His words still rang in her
ears. "I don't!"

All remembers they can be inviting.
But some all together mighty frightening.

Her mini radio played the song, 'Don't Speak' by No
Doubt. She felt like she could die there and would be
better for it.

As we die both you and I with my head in my hands
I sit and cry!!!
Don't speak. I know just what your saying.
So please stop explaining.
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.
Don't speak. I know what your thinking,
And I don't need your reasons.
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.

She wanted to die! She wanted to die so badly to get
rid of the pain. She raised herself to the ground.

It's all ending, we got to stop pertending.
Who we ar e!

The only person she loved, Tenchi-sama, now the only
thing that kept her alive was herself. She needed to
die.

You and me, I can see us dying. Are we?

She pulled her sword out of thin air and raised it
over her head.

Don't speak, I know what your saying
So please stop explaining.
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.
Don't speak, I know what your thinking,
And I don't need your reasons,
Don't tell me 'cause it hurts.

She whispered his name again. "Tenchi-sama, I love
you. Goodbye. My love!"

I know what your saying so please
Stop explaining.
Don't speak. I know what your thinking,
And I don't need your reasons
I know you're good. I know you're good.
I know you're real good.
Hush hush darling...

Ryoko lay lifeless on the cave floor as the song ended.
