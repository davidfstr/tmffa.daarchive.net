(Ryoko and Ayeka are watching t.v. in the Masaki living room)

Ryoko: This show sucks!
Ayeka: Yes, but this is the only thing on...(soap opera music plays) and I will 
find a way to enjoy it!  Washu's evil twin will not get away with this t.v. 
scandal!
Ryoko: Washu doesn't have an evil twin.  She doesn't even have a brother or 
sister.
(a needle scratches making the music stop and Ayeka looks at the camera)
Ayeka: Um...(music starts again) I'll still enjoy the show.
(Tenchi walks onstage with Mihoshi)
Mihoshi: Look!  Tenchi bought me a cookie!
(Kiyone appears from nowhere)
Kiyone: Well that's just fine!
Tenchi: It does not mean that I love her!
Mihoshi: Tenchi!  Nooooo!
Tenchi: I love another!
(Washu runs onstage as if on cue)
Washu: I must tell you.....
(Ryoko grabs Washu by the front of her shirt and shakes her)
Ryoko: IF IT'S YOU THAT TENCHI LOVES I'LL......
Washu: Ryoko!  Stop this now!  I came here to say Sasami fell down a well and 
was taken to the hospital after she was rescued!
(Everyone gasps)
Ayeka: No!  Not Sasami!
(Ayeka faints)
Tenchi: We must hurry to the hospital!
________________________________________________________________________

(Everyone is gathered around Sasami's hospital bed)
Ayeka: Sasami, my dearest sister, are you all right?
Sasami: I think so Ayeka.
Washu: Tell us Sasami, how did it happen?
Sasami: I will not say for it someone we all know did this to me!
Kiyone: Sasami!  We must know!  Tell us!
Sasami: I...cannot.
(Ryoko grabs Sasami)
Ryoko: Tell us twerp!
(Ryoko looks around)
Ryoko: I mean...it is imperative you tell us!
Sasami: It was.....Noboyuki!
(Everyone spins around and Noboyuki happens to be there)
Noboyuki: Yes I did it!  I could not stand her anymore!  That annoying little 
voice and blue hair.  The cooking was ok...but she had to go!
Mihoshi: What about Tenchi?  Is it Sasami he loves?
Tenchi: No it is not.
Washu: It's me right?
Ryoko: No me!
Ayeka: I think it is me that Tenchi desires.
Kiyone: He probably hates me.
Mihoshi: Why is that Kiyone?
Kiyone: I killed his mother.
(threateningly music plays and everyone gasps)
Tenchi: It was you who killed my mother, Achika?!
Noboyuki: No actually she fell down a well too...suspicious huh?
Tenchi: Oh yeah I remember that....it was after you both had that BIG fight 
and.....
Washu: *ahem* Back to finding out who Tenchi loves!
Ryoko: Tell us Tenchi!
(Suddenly Ryo-Ohki jumps up in Tenchi's lap)
Ryo-Ohki: Meow meow!
Tenchi: Yes my love.
(Everyone stares at Tenchi)
Everyone: YOU LOVE RYO-OHKI?!?!?!
Tenchi: It's true!  I love a cabbit!  And I must tell her something.
(Tenchi looks at Ryo-Ohki)
Tenchi: Ryo-Ohki......I'm pregnant!
(Ryo-Ohki is speechless.  All the girls faint.  Noboyuki pats Tenchi on the 
back)
Noboyuki: Way to go son!
(All the girls jump up and start to cry)
Ryo-Ohki: Meow!
(Tenchi kisses Ryo-Ohki.  Everyone gags and everything goes black)


The End
