The room is dark, the only thing that can be seen is a desk and 
a chair facing away from the camera.  The chair swivels around and a 
blonde man wearing a collared shirt and a tie glances at the viewers. 
	He begins to speak, "In times like these; fanfics are common. 
There are the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Everyone reads the good 
ones and agree that they are in fact, good.  Everyone reads the bad 
ones, and some think they are good, but the others think they aren't 
so good.  And then there are the ugly ones.  Almost everyone thinks 
that these are bad.  These fanfics must be punished in some way (at 
least until the other fans can find the authors).  It is because of this 
need for retribution that MSTings have become so popular.  A group 
of helpless people trapped in a room being forced to watch a horrible 
fanfic come alive.  What else do they have to do but comment and 
heckle it?  This time I have been forced to bring in extra help to 
work on this fic.  This fic is one of the worst ever written.  For 
those of you who have read it, you should recognize the title.  If you 
haven't read it, you've probably heard of it.  Tonight's title is 
"Kagato's Revenge."  On behalf of myself, and my two co-MSTers, we 
hope you enjoy our work.
	The chair swivels around again and the room goes totally dark.

	Vegita looked out the window of the building.  He sighed and 
his thoughts returned to the battle that he had been forcefully 
removed from thrice.  Pixy Misa approached him and placed a hand on 
his shoulder.  She smiled at him but he shrugged her off.
	She asked him, "Why is it you're always so mad anyway?"
	He turned back to her and frowned.  "What happened to you?  
You used to support me backstabbing everyone I met."
	Pixy Misa's eyes lit up and she smiled again.  "It's because of 
Pretty Sammy.  She helped me break out of the evil spell that I was 
under.  Now I fight with her.  It's nice to be one of the good guys.  You 
should try it sometime."
	Vegita grunted, "I'm sure."
	On the other side of the room, Senichi was chatting with 
Makoto.
	"So, you're sure you're not interested at all?"
	Mako-chan growled and punched him in the gut.  "No, you ecchi!  
I'm not going to pose for your pictures!"
	Senichi picked himself up from the ground and sighed.
	The four paused mid-sentence when they heard footsteps 
approaching from outside the door.  It slowly opened and Alexander 
walked in.
	With his head down, he began to speak, "Okay people.  You all 
know why I've brought you here again.  I was told to MST another fic.  
This one is really bad.  I'm going in there with you guys this time."
	Everyone in the room gasped.
	Vegita sputtered, "Wait?  It's worse than the other two we 
did?  How is that possible?"
	Alex spoke again, "It's worse.  Trust me.  In fact it's so bad, 
I've enlisted two other MST squads to help us out."
	Everyone formed a huge sweatbead on each of their heads.
	Alex looked over his shoulder and yelled, "Hey Ksa, bring your 
guys in."
	In stepped four newcomers. The first one was wearing a vest, 
black jeans, and boots.  Over his shoulder, was slung the Nyoibo 
staff, the weapon which could change length.  His brown hair rose in 
gravity defying bangs, and a black visor covered his eyes.
	"Ksawarrior, reporting for duty!" he yelled.  "MSTers, enter!" A 
pale girl, with blue hair, and eyes that were red like rubies shone 
brightly. All she was wearing was a skin tight plug suit.
	Senichi moved right up to her and asked, "Hi, what's your name 
and age?"
	Suddenly, someone grabbed him from behind, lifting him up by 
his neck. "She's Rei Ayanami and she's only 14, hentai."  The 
newcomer dropped him, walking into full view. He was wearing a 
black leather jacket, and matching cap, with jeans and sneakers. His 
brown eyes showed a lot of anger.
	"Sorry about that." the next person said, helping Senichi up. He 
wore what resembled travelling clothing, with a backpack and 
umbrella hanging from his shoulders. "Scimitar's been like that since 
he took a look at Kanashii no Imi."
	"I swear Ryoga, if I meet that Jeff guy, he will suffer fates 
more painful then hell itself." Scimitar replied back to his friend.
	Alex groaned, "Ugh, you've read that one too?"
	Everyone else formed sweatdrops on their heads.
	Turning to Ksa, Alex asked, "So, where is Xelloss?  Isn't he on 
your squad?"
	Ksa formed a sweatbead and answered, "Um, when I checked his 
room, he left a note saying, 'Don't get up today.  Why?  That's a 
secret.'"
	Rei nodded in agreement,  "We should have listened."
	Alex said, "Well, let's bring in the others we'll be working 
with."  He stuck his head out into the hall.  "Okay, you can come in 
now!"
	Another four newcomers entered the room.  The first was 
young girl about with short purplish black hair and bright blue eyes.  
Beside her was a young lady with dark green hair in a slightly spiked 
ponytail with a long vicious sword at her hip.  Behind the first girl 
entered a young man with black hair tied behind him and gold catlike 
eyes.  He looked well built but seemed hesitant.  Finally a rather 
young boy with shaggy dark blonde hair looking quite goofy and ready 
for trouble followed behind the other three.
	Senichi dashed up to the two girls and looked them over.  
Before he could open his mouth, Vegita blasted him from behind, 
knocking him over.  The four newcomers looked strangely at Vegita 
and Alex said, "Trust me.  It's for the best."  The four looked at Alex 
and blinked.
	Makoto asked, "So, who are you four?"
	The first new girl said, "We are apparently..."
	The blond boy interrupted, "Here to save your scared butts!"
	The green tressed girl slammed the boy into the ground with 
the hilt of her sword.  "Excuse him... he drank oil and other various 
chemicals as a child."
	Vegita grinned, "I see."
	"Anyway," she continued, "I am Arianna Celest."
	The heap on the floor groggily stated, "R-ryu Hadowaki."
	The still standing boy said, "Akito Kashiwa."
	The purple haired girl stated, "And I guess I'm the leader of 
this group...Sammy Hisaki."
	Alex smiled, "Well, welcome."  He pointed towards Ksa and his 
group.  "This is the third group."
	Sammy gasped in horror, "THREE groups?"
	Alex replied, "Yeah, the fic is that horrible."
	Ksa nodded back, "Terrifying, ain't it?"
	Arianna grimly stated, "Yup, definitely bad."  Sammy's crew all 
pulled out specialized vomit bags.
	Scimitar turned to Arianna, "Could I have one?"
	Rei gulped, "I made sure not to eat yet.  Just in case."
	Gloating, Akito laughed, "You girls are so funny!  I on the other 
hand, only get weak with Sasami Lemons."
	Ryoga formed a sweatdrop and said, "You just jinxed us, didn't 
you?"
	Akito gulped, "What?  Ohh... I don't feel so good.... URP!"
	Gloating, Scimitar gave a laugh, "Ha!  I only get sick when its 
severe Sasami torture fics."
	Vegita groaned, "You had to say it, didn't you?"
	Sammy nonchalantly asked, "What IS it with people's 
fascination with seeing her get slammed in the ass?"
	Rei turned to Sammy, "Behave."
	Akito sweated and quickly said, "Ah, what she's trying to say 
is why see a little girl... do that 'stuff'?"
	Sammy blushed, "Heh, heh... oops"
	Pixy Misa gasped, "Can she say that?"
	Senichi smiled, "Yeah, only Vegita can't say things like that.  
Isn't that right?"
	Vegita growled.
	Disgusted, Ksa sighed, "You'd be surprised how many people 
hate Sasami."
	Arianna lit up in anger, "I don't!  I just want to cuddle her and 
give her a big hug!"
	Ryu was taken aback, "You?  Miss 'Dark Almighty High Powered 
Woman'?"
	Scimitar wacks Ryu over the head, "Shut up.  Never insult such 
a beautiful lady, such as this."
	Arianna looked at Scimitar and blushed, "Huh?  Hey that's my 
job!"
	Alex quickly said, "Well, enough chit chat, let's get down to 
business!"
	Everyone present sighed as they ran into the theater.  The 
seating order from right to left was Alex, Senichi, Makoto, Vegita, 
Pixy Misa, Ksa, Scimitar, Ryoga, Rei, Sammy, Akito, Ryu, and Arianna.

*****************************************************

>It occured to me that Kagato never got his revenge on Tenchi and 
the others
>for his defeat. 

Arianna: Uh...What a keen observation!
Ksa: Mostly because, oh, I dunno, HE'S DEAD!!!
Vegita: Maybe his friends wished him back with the DragonBalls.
Alex: Nope, he just jumped through a big plot hole.

>Here now is the continuing saga of the evil space villain
>Kagato.....

Rei: And people say I'm good with resurrection.
Ryu: You look like you're good with other things too!
Senichi: I agree!
Sammy and Arianna: RYU!
(Vegita slams his fist into Senichi's stomach)
(Sammy and Arianna slam Ryu)
Ryu and Senichi: Ouch...

>                             KAGATO'S REVENGE


>by Washu 6/10/97
>_____________________________________________________
____________________

Scimitar: Oh my, a tripwire!
Ryoga: And may it trip the author forever.
Akito: Amen!

>  It was a beautiful spring day and Ryo-ohki was bounding through 
the carrot
>patch with cheerful meows for everyone. 

Scimitar: If this is 'At the Carrot Patch' I swear, someone will die.
(Vegita and Misa turn slightly green)
Vegita: We already did that one.
Misa: First one we did.
Ryu: Remodeled with Kagato...DUDE!
Sammy: THAT is fear folks!
Vegita: *URP*

>Tenchi was busy shovelling dirt

Akito: (As Tenchi) Goshdarnit! Where did I put that lucky stone at?!

>for the new vegitable patch. Sasami and Mihoshi were planting seed
>in the freshly hoed rows of dirt.

Ryu: That whole sentance just rang with hentainess!
(The others groan)
Senichi and Makoto: Wow, a person more hentai than me!
(Everyone looks at Makoto)
Makoto: What?

>  Sasami looked up from her work and wipped her brow. She took a 
moment
>to survey the day's accomplishments. She watched Tenchi on the far 
side
>of the field. He was busy digging. 

Arianna: That hole must be getting big!
Ryu: Heh Heh Heh...
Arianna: Shut up Ryu...

Off in one corner of the garden, Ryoko 
>and Aeka were having a screaming match. 

Scimitar: Rei, Ksa, please...
Sammy: Uh oh...
Akito: This will be bad...
Ryoga: Spare us.
Rei & Ksa:(Ryoko & Aeka) 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHH!
Scimitar & Ryoga: Why us?
Vegita: (cringes) You?  What about me?  Saiya-jin ears are a lot 
more sensitive than yours.
Arianna: (blinks) What did you say? (rubbing her ears)

>Sasami sighed. So what
>else is new? she thought. 
>  Ryo-ohki hopped up with a fresh carrot in her mouth. "Meow, 
meow,
>meow!!!" she said loudly. 

Ksa: Translation: Sasami, quick, use your Pretty Sammy powers on 
this lemon writer.
Misa: Sammy's in trouble?  That darn Romio.  Hey, she looks like 
Ayeka.
Arianna: To hell with Pretty Sammy! I wanna give him a nice taste of 
this! (pulls out her sword Dark Fire which is fair sized and sharp, 
and finely crafted)
Akito: AAH! Watch where you're swinging that!!


>Sasami looked down and frowned.

Sammy: (Sasami) Ryo-Ohki how many times have I told you to use the 
Cabbit liter box!? Peew...

>  "Have you been eating the fresh carrots again Ryo-Ohki?" Tenchi 
>won't be very happy about that pleased. 

Rei: So he'd be happier if she ate the rotten ones?
Misa: I don't know, Ryo-ohki has always been a puzzle to me.
Sammy: No kidding...first she's a female then she's a male........
Ryu: So she's a hermaphrodite?

>Ryo-Ohki looked at her forlornly.
>  Suddenly, a dark shadow loomed above their heads.

Vegita: ACK!!!!  It's Frieza!
(Everyone stares at him)
Vegita: Uh, nevermind...

>Everyone looked up
>to see a giant spacecraft hovering over the field. Without warning,
>a blast of green light engulfed them all. 

All: ( sing X-Files theme) Doo doo doo do do doo!

>Tenchi yelled out Sasami's 
>name. 

Rei:(Sasami) Tenchi!
Scimitar:(Tenchi) Sasami's name!
Senichi:(Tenchi) out Sasami's name!

>It was the last thing that Sasami heard before she lost 
conciousness....

Misa:(Sasami) Ow Tenchi, how many time do I have to tell you... loud 
noises can cause concussions.

>  Sasami awoke with a start. Her head was spinning and she felt 
dazed. 

Ksa: She became Beetlejuice on drugs.
Vegita: Probably hit her head on the way in.
Makoto: Either that or the room is spinning.
Arianna: Or she's on a spinning platform.

>She
>was lying on her back, strapped securely to an operating table. 

Ryoga: Alright then, who's playing doctor?
Rei: Do you understand what you just said?
Ryoga:(thinks about it. nose explodes) GYAAAAAA!!
Arianna: Hey watch it! 
Ryu: Why'd he do that? Is he like a faucet or something?
Sammy and Arianna: ........... (Facevault)
Vegita: (confused) What is that red stuff?
Makoto: It's blood.
Vegita: What is blood?
Alex: Boy Vegita, those censors sure are giving you a hard time, 
aren't they?
Senichi: I'd think so...

>When she 
>tried to move her arms, they wouldn't budge. She looked around the 
room
>in terror, trying to make sense of her predicament.

Scimitar: But, like this lemon, it was senseless.
Senichi: Hey, not all lemons are senseless!
Ryu: Absloutley correct. Some live up to the standards of being high 
in morals, educational and in character.
(All give Ryu a "yeah right" look)
Arianna: Only you and Senichi would look at lemons as being 
"educational".

>  The room was large and white like an operating room. 

Sammy: This IS sounding like the X-Files...
Akito: Peachy...all we need now is the Cigarette Smoking Man to 
molest Sasami...
(Sammy and Arianna turn green at the thought)
Alex: Your wish is granted.  Well, almost...
(Everyone turns white with fear)

>She was confused and desperately tried to free her hands.
>  Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room. "Well Sasami, it seems 
that I 
>will have my revenge at last!" Sasami recognized Kagato's cruel and 
evil 
>voice. 

Ksa: Technecally speaking, Tenchi is the one he'd want revenge on the 
most.
Rei:(Kagato) Now, you'll pay for wha- Oh, sorry, wrong person.

>She looked around the room in terror and confusion. 
>  A heartless laugh reverberated through the room. "I've been 
waiting
>for you Sasami..." Kagato cackled. "I've been so looking forward
>to our next encounter!"

Scimitar: Considering they never had a first encounter.
Alex: I dunno.  He knew Washu, who is Tsunami's sister, who is in 
turn Sasami.  He saw the Tsunami spaceship... Oh wait, he did see 
Sasami when he came down and Yosho fought him on the planet.

>   Sasami was terrified. She squirmed and strained against the
>strong clamps that held her wrists and ankles to the table. A
>huge screen descended from the ceiling. 

Arianna: (Sasami) Great! Can you turn it to Channel 11? My favorite 
soap is on right about now!
Vegita: (Kagato) No, I'm going to make you watch old reruns of Sailor 
Moon.
Makoto: HEY! (She kicks Vegita in the head and he eats the carpet)
Vegita: (jumps up) How did you do that?  Your power level is nowhere 
near mine.
Alex: Look, give up on the power level thing... it's a lame rating 
system anyway.

>On it was as taunting image
>of Kagato's face. His evil glare looked down at her from above.
>  "Now you can see me watching you little one!" he grinned "You will
>be able to see the joy in my face as I submit your young body to 
>HELL!" 

Rei:(Sasami) No, not-
Ksa:(Kagato) Yes! Azusa, come meet your new playmate.
Senichi: Oh the pain!
Ryoga: The horror!
Akito: The agony!
Ryu: Azusa is going to do Sasami!?
Sammy: AAHH!! I HOPE NOT!! THAT'S LOW!!! 
Arianna: Inbreeding.............eugh... (Shudders)
Alex: That's why Ryoko should get Tenchi.  Ayeka's his great-half 
aunt.

>Kagato touched a button and his image was replaced by a mirror
>reflection of Sasami clamped to the table. "See how pretty you are
>my dear?" he said with a sarcastic grin. "You can see absolutely
>everyting that is happening to you."

Scimitar: Wait a sec, I thought he wanted her to see him enjoying 
himself, now he wants her not 
to see him?
Ksa: Don't try to reason.

>  Without warning, the wall at her left opened up and a cluster of 
evil
>looking machinery slid forth from the darkness.

Misa: Okay, how does machinery look evil?
Ryu: Easily...lots and lots of spikes!

>The mechanical nightmare
>hummed to life as Kagato pushed the buttons on his controller 
madly.

Akito: (Kagato) Now young Sasami...  Speak into the microphone and 
place your order!
(Others facevault)

>  Sasami gasped in horror as she watched metallic tentacles writh 
and
>twitch as the machinery unfolded above her. 

Misa: I see.
Ksa: This is bad. Very bad.
Scimitar: I feel a tentacle lemon coming on.
Sammy: Ya think?
Arianna: (Raises hand) Gee lookit the time!  Time for me to go have 
root canal done! 
Alex: Hey, we've all got to live through this.
Arianna: Can't we all just go watch "The Blair Witch Project" 
instead? It's just as bad! (pleadingly)
Alex: Okay, you'd rather puke from motion sickness than from 
watching a really bad lemon?  Wait, that was a dumb question.

>Silvery metal tentacles
>with various probes and needles moved into place above the 
operating
>table. One of the evil metal worms boasted a horrific electric 
sawblade
>which hummed quietly. Sasami shuddered in terror.

Ksa: C'mon, a sawblade is a little too extreme!
Arianna: Uh Uh...remember the "Tenchi on a Plate of Sashimi"? Now 
that eyeball thing...THAT'S extreme...
Vegita: You guys did that too?
Senichi: Ugh, that was taking porn too far.

>  Kagato laughed insanely as the torture tentacles hovered over 
Sasami.

Akito: And they rebelled and tickled her instead. End of Story...... 
(Pauses then snaps his fingers) Shucks...
Makoto: It's never that easy...

>  "Now you will see what pain and torment really mean!" he cackled 
>sadistically. Sasami's eyes welled up with tears and frustration.
>"Please let me go!!" she begged. Kagato just smirked and glared
>at her evily.

Rei: When dealing with a major villian, remember that 'please' never 
works.
Sammy: How about offering him Tea and crumpets?
Makoto: (takes notes) Never tried that one...

>  "Not until you've paid the price for my defeat at the hands of your
>friends!"

Scimitar:(to Kagato) Here's an idea, why not torture her friends 
instead.
Vegita:(Kagato) Nah, they play too rough.
 
>   Sasami whimpered aprehensively as she watched the torture 
tentacles
>squirm above her. Kagato pressed a button on his control pad and 
suddenly
>the silver tentacles came to life. Sasami gasped in horror as a 
tentacle
>descended to the table where she was held captive. At the tip of the 
tentacle
>was what seemed to be a tiny sawblade.

Sammy: Hmm...so many saws. Makes ya wonder if Kagato was a 
lumberjack in his past life...
Akito: (To Kagato) Wake up! She's not a Great Redwood Tree!
Senichi: (singing) Oh I'm a lumberjack and I'm o-kay...
(Vegita blasts him into the wall)
Ryu: Geeze Veggi!! Singing envy?
Vegita: What did you call me? (He blasts Ryu into the opposite wall)

>   As Sasami watched in horror, the blade began to rotate faster and 
faster
>until a loud hum emminated from the cruel device. The tentacle 
suddenly 
>moved lower down on her body and out of Sasami's line of sight.

Senichi: Wouldn't that be anywhere below her neck?
Alex: No, he set up a mirror, remember?
Senichi: Okay, then where is out of her line of sight?

>Her eyes
>grew wide in terror and she clenched her fists together in 
anticipation 
>of what was going to happen.

Ksa: Um, Kagato, she's a girl, no need to nuder her.
Scimitar:(Clutching vomit bag) Do you mind?
Senichi: Maybe he's going to circumcise her.
(Makoto and Misa smack Senichi to the ground)

>   She yelped aloud as she heared the sound of the blade begin 
cutting into
>the fabric of her pretty blue dress. She shook her head violently in 
>desperate protest. The tentacle slowly eased the sawblade up her 
thigh,
>rending the delecate fabric of her clothes.

Rei: I knew that he was evil, but I never thought Kagato would go 
this far!
Akito: Who knew Nobuyuki would want his own son?
Sammy: Who knew Achika was a sex crazy mad girl?
Arianna: Who knew Ryoko enjoyed toe sex?
Vegita: Who knew Ryoko and Ayeka enjoyed EYE-SOCKET SEX?!?!?!
Sammy: It's all in the mind of the author...(Shudders)
 
>   Through tears in her eyes, Sasami saw another tentacle descend 
from
>the metallic cluster hovering above her. The new metal worm had 
shiny
>grippers like pointed pinchers attached to the end of it. The vile
>looking pointed fingers of the gripper opened and closed 
mennacingly
>with a metallic click.

Ksa: Hey, its the sound effects from the Addams Family theme.
All:(hum Addams Family theme. Clicks from the fic timed perfectly 
with the snap effect)
 
>   The sawblade slowly worked its way up to Sasami's waist. Every 
few
>inches, it made a little nick in her flesh causing her to cry out.

Alex: Yeah, it's official... this qualifies as Level 6.
Senichi: And what is that, prey tell?
Alex: Basically the Overfiend learns how to torture.
(Everyone shudders)

>As the blade reached her pretty belt, it viciously sawwed into it
>slicing the fabric in two.
>   Sasami could feel the sting of the mini cuts that the spinning 
>blade had caused on her soft thighs. Her tears of pain and fright
>poured down the sides of her face.

Ksa: I dunno who to kill, the author, or Kagato.
Scimitar: Considering that _KAGATO'S DEAD_, the author will have 
to do.
Ryu: And his little dog too!

>   The gripper tentacle clasped her shredded blue dress and slowly
>pulled the two halves apart revealing what was underneath. 

Ryoga: Don't go there!

>Sasami's
>lacy blue panties were exposed now. 

Ryoga: He went there.

>Here beautiful young legs showed
>the tiny cuts inflicted by the sawblade. Little trickles of blood
>ran down the sides of her thighs from the many small wounds.

Ryoga: Great technology, and he can't keep from cutting her legs?
Ksa: Ryoga, he is torturing her, y'know.
Scimitar: What, being in this fic isn't torture enough?
(Rei plays a rimshot)
Misa: Personally, I think us MSTing this is torture.
Alex: I'm sorry, it needs to be done.
Arianna: Even so...shouldn't we be payed for this?

>   Sasami's cheeks grew flushed as Kagato eyed her bare legs. 
>"What a pretty young thing you are.." he cackled. "The very thought
>of defiling your flesh makes my heart soar!" 

(Ksa looks thoughtful)
Scimitar: What are you doing?
Ksa: Trying to think of a reason that he would do this to her, and 
still be in character.
Rei: How about, trying to lure Tsunami out?
Ksa: That'll work.
Vegita: Wow, a technically IC lemon.
Senichi: Aikan Muyo... very IC...

>He continued pressing
>buttons on his controller and more tentacles descended from the
>mechanical cluster of evil.

Scimitar: It has officially become worse.
Akito: You can say that again...
Makoto: Have you noticed, this author likes the word "evil"?

>   The sawblade tentacle began cutting up Sasami's delecate blouse.

Arianna: Well one error...I-
Ryu: Geeze here she goes again...Miss Corrections
Alex: Grammar Nazi strikes again...
Arianna: (growls) It happens to be my pet peeve!!
Ryu: (jokingly) I thought people walking in on you when you were -
Arianna: AAAAAAAAAAGGGGH!!! (Flies at Ryu and there's a series of 
punches and cries from Ryu)

>She cried out as the blade cut viciously into the tender flesh of
>her tummy. 

(Everyone holds their stomachs)
Ksa: What is this, a lemon, or dark fic?
Ryoga: With our luck, probably both.
Alex: The lost boy has it!

>The gripper tentacle yanked at her clothes, tearing the
>fabric and exposing more of her soft flesh to the eyes of her
>tormentor.
>    Sasami's tears welled to weeping as she sobbed in frustration
>and terror. 

Sammy: (Sasami) THIS WAS A DESIGNER DRESS YOU BAKA!! (cries)
Vegita: (Kagato) No kidding?  (checks the label)  Wow, done by the 
same person who made my suit!  I'll order a new one for you once I 
finish this lemon.  Okay?

>The sawblade finished its vile work and the gripper
>stripped her of the last remnant of her shredded outer clothing.
>    Kagato watched in delight as Sasami blushed and struggled.

Rei: I'm hoping that he's enjoying this because he's evil, not a 
pedophile.

>Her lacy blue bra was exposed now, hiding her budding young breats.

Scimitar:(butcher) Would you like the breasts?
Ryoga:(customer) Nah, I'll just have the breats.
Arianna: (Finished beating on Ryu) I won't say it...

>She looked up at Kagato's taunting image on the screen above her.

Ksa: So, now, he lets her see his face?

>Sasami felt ashamed at her bareness and her cheeks flushed as she
>tried to turn away from his gaze.
>    The naughty metallic tentacles now descended in a cluster of
>lust. 

Rei: I hate to be a nitpicker....
Scimitar: More then usual? (gets hit with the Lance of Longinus)
Ryu: You mean more than Arianna? (Gets hits with Arianna's fist)
Vegita: Or more than Senichi? (catches Senichi's fist and crushes it)
Rei: Like I was saying, I don't think that tentacles, can experience 
lust, or any other emotion.

>Sasami gasped as the probes snaked and writhed all over her
>body. The cold metal of the machine worms made her muscles tense.
>    A metal probe criss-crossed her upper body, poking at her young
>breats and chilling Sasami's flesh. 

Ksa: C'mon, normal hentai can at least spell breasts right.
Arianna: .......stupid......illiterate.....(grumbles)

>It slid underneath her bra clasp
>at the center of her chest and violently yanked outward.  She gasped
>as the lacy blue satin was torn from her chest.

Ryu: Oooo Victoria's Secret too!!
Sammy: Ryu that's awfull!
Ryu: WHAT?!
(Sammy sighs)
Vegita: (turns to Alex) Can I blast him please?
Alex: Ask Sammy.
Sammy: Go for it!
Arianna: Get 'im good! 
Akito: ummmm....
Ryu: N-now Veggi...dude this is SO not cool...!
Vegita: (grining, fires a HUGE beam of energy at Ryu, making a nice 2 
foot deep indent of him on the wall)  Don't call me Veggi!

>Her soft pretty 
>breasts were exposed now. 

Scimitar: WHAT BREASTS?!
Makoto: How old is she?
Misa: 10.
Makoto: I had breasts when I was 10.  What's so odd about her?
Alex: Yeah, and at 14 you've got a 38D... I dunno...
Makoto: (blushes) How do you know my cup size?
Alex: You left one of your bras lying in the bedroom.  On top of the 
puddle.
(Makoto blushes even more)
Senichi: Why couldn't I have been there to see that?
(Vegita blasts Senichi towards Makoto, and she kicks him in midair 
into the opposite wall)

>Her little pink nipples were hard and
>her cheeks grew red in embarrassment. 

Ryu: Guess it was a little "Nippy" eh girls?
(Arianna and Sammy glare and put their arms over their chests, 
blushing red)
Senichi: Good one!  (Gives Ryu the thumbs up)

>    More metallic tentacles carressed her neck and wrapped around
>her pretty blue hair. Sasami writhed and fought against her bonds
>as the tentacles wrapped themselves around her little tits. The
>cold steel of the probes made her tiny pink nipples grow harder
>as they tickled and carressed Sasami's naked chest.

Rei: Not that I agree with the victim, but this sounds nice.
(the others glare daggers at her now)
Rei: Never mind.
Senichi: You're sure you won't pose for me?

>    Other evil metal worms were getting to work on her lower half.
>Cold probes of steel were wrapping themselves around Sasami's 
bare
>legs. They slithered and wriggled around her thighs, wrapping her
>pretty legs tightly. To her horror, the tentacles began to pull
>Sasami's legs apart, spreading her thighs and exposing the crotch
>of her lacy blue panties.

Ryoga: (holding nose) Oh NO!

>   Sasami cried out "Oh NO!" 

Ksa: (to Ryoga) How the hell did you do that?
Misa: Creepy...

>as the naughty worms held her legs
>open for Kagato to admire. "Please... oh please!" she begged.
>   "Quiet now lovely one..." Kagato whispered. His image on the
>screen above her was as cold as the tentacles. He glared at her
>with a look of pure hate.

Scimitar: Gee, a few lines earlier, he seemed to be admiring her.
Arianna: Villians...
Ryu: You're one to talk! One minute you're turning Sammy here into 
Sayuri and the next you're all buddy buddy!

>   As the tentacles on her chest slowly molested her pretty tits,
>a new metal worm broke off from the rest and positioned itself
>over Sasami's face. It wiggled infront of her eyes, nodding in
>a lifelike way, 

All: Don't go there!

>then suddenly plunged into her mouth without
>warning. 

All: He went there.

>Sasami gasped and gagged as the intruder invaded her
>young mouth. She clutched at her bonds in horror as the silver
>worm violently penetrated her throught.

Ksa: Now, I know that everyone thinks that this can be done, but if a 
object of that length went inside someone's mouth, it probably rip 
out their ass later.
Others: Thank you for the mental image!

>   Sasami's warm saliva coated the tentacle, making it slippery
>and warm. It plunged down her throught, raping her mouth slowly
>with metal. Sasami gagged and fought against it, but the tentacle
>continued to force its way into her throat. 

Akito: (Kagato) HAHAHA!
Sammy: (Sasami) Orrggh O..orrr!!!! (silent)
Akito: (Kagato) HAHAHAH- aahh...Sasami?

>It began to gently 
>pump her mouth, violating her lips profanely and probing the 
>interior of her throat.

(Scimitar sticks his finger inside his mouth)
Vegita: (shocked) What are you doing?
Ryoga: Are you trying to imitate it?
Scimitar: No, just trying to make it easier for me to puke.

>   The tentacles at the lower half of her body kept her legs
>tightly spread as new probes positioned themselves infront of
>Sasami's exposed crotch. 

Ksa: Don't go there!

>A tentacle slipped under the lacy
>blue elastic of her panties and squirmed over her virgin
>pussy. Sasami arched her back in protest as more tentacles
>slipped under her panties and probed her female secrets.

Ksa: He went there.
Scimitar: We really are overdoing that joke.
Ksa: So?
Scimitar: So, we want to look like pros.
Ksa: Oh yeah, well, the 'pros' as you call them, always use the same 
jokes over and over again.
Ryoga: Does that mean we're pros?
Ksa: ........... Never thought of it that way.
Alex: So the fact that Vegita can't kill people or swear would count... 
right?
(Vegita grumbles)

>   One of the tentacles exerted force on the satin fabric
>of her panties and the lacy garment ripped open, exposing
>her soft bush of blue pubic hair. 

Rei: She's either 8 or 10, but either way, she won't have that yet!
Makoto: That's not true either.  I got my first hairs when I was 10.
Misa: (looks down her outfit)  Sorry, none for me...
(Everyone cringes except for Ryu)
Ryu: How's it blue? She dye it or something?
(Sammy and Arianna glare icily but make no move)

>A tentacle rubbed over
>her pussy, pressing against her little clit and causing
>Sasami to moan softly.
>    The tentacles spread her legs wider and opened her
>pussy to more exploration. A metal worm gently carressed her
>soft clit, sending tingles through Sasami's body. It
>rubbed back and forth against her little nub, causing
>her clit to swell and burn with pleasure.

Scimitar: (hands on fire) The heat is on!
Others: (deadpan) Lame.
Scimitar: I never get a break.
 
>   Sasami tried to cry out, but the slippery metal phallus
>in her mouth prevented her from screaming. She gagged
>slowly as the worm continued to rape her tight throat.
>   The tentacles below held her legs tightly as the 
>metal worm continued its onslaught on Sasami's virgin
>clit. A trickle of vaginal fluid was slowly coating
>Sasami's young pussy. The metal worms became slippery
>and warm as they slipped back and forth across her 
>damp bush. 

Ksa: Rei, as resident female, at that age, would that happen?
Rei: (angry) No comment.
Makoto: Yes. (She blushes, realizing what she just said)
Senichi: Exactly how would you know?
(Vegita points his hand at Senichi's face)
Senichi: Nevermind

>   Two tentacles pressed against her pussy lips, spreading
>them open and exposing her vagina to the intruding worms.
>A tentacle gently carressed the her pussy 

Sammy: The Her Pussy?
Akito: A new species...?
All: Interesting...Hmm...(Raise a hand to their chins as if in deep 
thought)
Alex: I'm thinking the "the" before the "her" was a typo.
Vegita: (sarcastically) Well, thank you grammar king!
Ryu: Awww! Veggi you defended us! You DO care!!
(The others form large sweatdrops as the inevitable thud of Ryu 
crashing into the wall yet again is heard)
Vegita: (dusting off his hands) I TOLD you... don't call me Veggi!

>and Sasami squirmed
>in frustration. The tentacle slipped inside her and began
>to probe the interior of her virgin pussy. It thrust into
>her more violently and began to writhe and pump itself 
>faster and faster.

Sammy: She's a virgin right...?
Arianna: Yep...
(Both girls shift uncomfortably and cross their legs while Ryu and 
Akito grin)
Senichi: Now wait a... (looks at Vegita hovering over him) uhm... 
nevermind...

>   Suddenly, Sasami noticed that the tentacles inside of
>her were growing increasingly warm. 

Ksa: Uh oh.
Scimitar: Yep, it just turned darkfic.
Misa: As if it wasn't a darkfic before?

>The one raping her pussy

Akito: He's raping her cat too?
Sammy: Bad pun Akito...
Vegita: (Starts to power up) Any objections to me blasting him?

>began to slide in and out of her wetly. It's slippery metal
>squirmed and pumped her pussy with viciousness. It penetrated
>her deeply, exploring the far recesses of her vagina with each
>thrust. It tickled her cervix, causing a spasm in Sasami's
>lower half. 

Arianna: Ugh...at least he was paying close attention in Health class...
Sammy: I don't know...it makes me VERY uncomfortable to think he 
knows THAT much about the female anatomy...(keeping her legs 
crossed)
Senichi: I think I'll keep my mouth shut on this one.
Vegita: Good idea.

>    The tentacle raping her mouth was getting warm as well.
>It heated up her tongue as it quickly thrust against the
>back of her throat. The tentacle was slimey and wet with
>her saliva and tasted metallic. It made Sasami wince and gag.

Rei: Could we blame you?

>    A new tentacle pushed its way inside her pussy, coming 
>alongside the first one. 

All: ...........
Ksa: So, right now, her, *ahem* lower region, is strecthing out just 
like a rubber band. Is anyone else having problems picturing this?
Others:(raise hands)
Ryu: (Doesn't raise his hand) COOL! She's one of those stretch dolls!
(The others groan)

>Sasami arched her back in torment
>as her pussy was stretched widely. 

(Rei gives a sympathy groan)
(Sammy and Arianna moan and wince)
(Makoto and Misa wince in pain)
Ryu: (To Ksa) Makes ya wonder if you poke them what they'll do...

>The first vaginal tentacle
>had begun to wriggle inside her womb, pushing past her cervix
>and violating her womanhood profanely. It squeezed into
>her womb violently and explored the dark recesses of her flesh.

Ksa: Right now, the mental image makes Sasami look like a really 
streched out thing, with a shit load of tentacles in her.

>   The second tentacle inside her pussy continued pumping and
>writhing as a new metal worm placed its pinchers on Sasami's
>clit. It grasped the little pink nub tightly and began to
>vibrate with an electric hum. 

Makoto: Oh my!
Rei: GAH! (jumps on Scimitar's head)
Scimitar: Do you mind, I dunno, GETTING OFF ME!
(The fic continues as they fight)

>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as pleasure burned through her clit.
>In spite of the violent metallic torture, the clit vibrator
>was sending tingles through her whole body. It pressed against
>her clit, holding itself tightly against Sasami's virgin nub.

Ryoga: I doubt that there'd be much pleasure in this.
Sammy: How right you are.......................
Akito: Huh? How'd you know?!
Sammy: Men....
(Akito sinks into his seat looking mad and hurt)
Senichi: What about us?
Arianna: No... ahem... comment...

>   Soon, she felt a hot flash of pleasure ripple through her
>pussy. She gasped and arched as tingles vibrated through her
>lower half. The tentacle raping her mouth withdrew itself slowly
>from her violated throat. As it escaped her lips, it left a hot
>trail of sticky saliva in its wake.
>   Sasami gasped for breath and moaned aloud. She writhed and
>arched her back as the vibrating tentacle nailed her little
>clit. "Oh...ooooooo.." she moaned in frustration. 

Rei: (Sasami moaning) Get me out of here!

>She closed
>her eyes tightly and clenched her fists. Wave after wave of
>burning pleasure tore through her clit and she cried out.
>  "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...!!!!" she moaned as her pussy spasmed
>with pleasure. Her clit burned in a white-hot climax as the
>tentacles inside her grew slippery and wet with her female
>juices.

Ryoga:(holding nose) Why is it that they always make it seem that 
the girl is some kinda fruit?
Ksa: Why do you think they're called lemons?
Alex: I thought that stemed from the "first lemon" having something 
to do with Project A-Ko.  Oh well.

>   Sasami shuddered and sighed deeply as her climax subsided.
>She went limp and the tentacle removed the vibrating clamp from
>her clit.
>
>    Kagato grinned on the screen above. Through her tears,
>Sasami could see his evil smile. "Are you ready to taste
>true torture?" he asked wickedly. 

All: WHAT?!?!
Ksa: C'mon, what more can he do to her?!
Sammy: This isn't going to be pretty.........

(At that time, the doorbell rang.  Alex got up, hit pause on the tape 
and answered the door.)

Sammy: Huh...? Who could that be?
Arianna: Who cares! It stalled the lemon!
Akito: Hallejuah!!! 
Ryu: Shucks...just when she was going to -
Sammy: Ryu!
Ryu: Well fellow hentais like me, Senichi and Veggi here- (looks at 
Senichi and Vegita) enjoy this stuff.
(The others form sweatdrops)
Vegita: Excuse me?!  (Kicks Ryu in the gut and chucks him into the 
wall.  He then fires three bolts of energy for good measure)  I am 
NOT a hentai!  AND STOP CALLING ME VEGGI OR I'LL KI... KI... KI... SEND 
YOU TO ANOTHER DIMENSION!!!  ARGH!!!!  (Blasts Ryu again in 
frustration)

Alex: (returns with a letter in his hands) Here Vegita, this came for 
you from Pioneer.
Vegita: (grabs the letter and reads it)  YES!  DBZ has finally been 
updated!  They've ki... ki... ki... KILLED the censors!
(All looked very shocked)
Makoto: Vegita!  What happened to your voice?
Misa: Yeah, and, you're bleeding!
Alex: Hmm, they must have changed his voice, and since the censors 
are gone, I guess they allow blood now.  Tell ya what Vegita, I like 
your old voice better, you can have it back for this place.  (Alex 
snaps his fingers)
Vegita: All right!  Now I can get the author of these fics and really 
do something with them!
Arianna: I'm with you all the way Vegita!
Ryu: Me too Veggi!
Vegita: Heh, time to test my new powers... (He charges up a beam and 
blasts Ryu into the wall, killing him)
(Everyone gasps)
Vegita: I hope you like it, being... dead... and all! (He begins to laugh 
manically)
Scimitar: 3...2...1....
(Botan flies into the room. Everyone looks shocked)
Botan: Just doing my job, sorry about this...(Scimitar's foot comes 
inches to her face) What?
Scimitar: Botan, much as he annoys me, we need him alive now.
Botan: But you know the ru-
Scimitar: Remember what I caught you doing with your oar?
(Botan blushes extremly)
Scimitar: Good, now do you want Koenma to know that?
(She shakes her head)
Scimitar: Then just let me heal him, ok? (smiles)
Botan: Ok. (leaves)
(Scimitar begins to heal up Ryu)
Rei: What just-
Ksa: He's a half-god, just go with it.
Vegita: Hmpf.  Lucky stiff...
(Everyone groans at the bad pun)
Scimitar: That was a bad joke Vegita.
Vegita: (thinks and then winces)  Oh, sorry.  No pun intended.
Alex: Leave the humor to the others, you're here for the violence 
factor.
Arianna: Oh I can get violent...
Misa: Oh, I'm sure you can...
Scimitar: (cracking knuckles) As can I.
Makoto:  Heh, I'm no virgin... (she pauses)
(Everyone looks at her)
Ryoga: (nose explodes)
Makoto:  To FIGHTING!!!  Jeeze!
Arianna: Hey hey hey... was that little girl in the tutu doubting me...?
Ksa: (goes SSJ/J) CAN WE ALL JUST CALM DOWN HERE!!
Vegita: (his jaw drops to the floor)  How? How? How?  How did you 
do that?
Ksa: I do that when I get mad...  And I'm mad.
Sammy: And Ryu is almost alive again...
Vegita: But the blonde hair, and the immense power!
Ksa: Did I mention that I go Super Saiya-jin at times?
Vegita: WHAT???  You're a Saiya-jin?
Ksa: Slight mix up when I needed a blood transfusion.
(All blink in disbelief)
Scimitar: And that isn't even the half of it...  It was mixed with 
Juraian blood.
(Sammy and Akito stand lost and Rei shakes her head in disbelief) 
Arianna: Wait a minute... (thinks)
Misa: How would that allow you to go Super Saiya-jin?
Ksa: I'm not exactly Washu... So I don't know .
Arianna: This is weird...Vegita you're Saiya-jin too right?
Vegita:  Yes, I am the strongest Saiya-jin warrior in the Universe!
Arianna: Well then why don't you blast this other Saiya-jin off your 
turf?!
Senichi:  What about Go... (he stops) Nevermind.
Ksa: Wait, Senichi's right!  What about Goku?
Arianna: Goku? Sounds like some form of silly putty...
Vegita:  No way!  I'm much stronger than that little wimp of a Saiya-
jin!
Ksa: (under breath) Who kicked your ass on one occasion.
Arianna: Well then Vegita blast this dude out of your territory...
Ksa: (grinning) You had to go ape to defeat him.
Vegita:  He got lucky!  It was only because of his punk kid that I had 
to leave!
Ksa: Sure, sure, keep telling yourself that.
Arianna: There's no such thing as luck anyway!
Sammy: Arianna are you just trying to start all out war here!?!!!!
Arianna: Um...yep basically... (grinning)
Scimitar: I personally would like to see that. (winks at Arianna)
Arianna: Keep dreaming...
Scimitar: (tears flowing down face) Why me, god?
(Suddenly, EVA-00 smashes through the wall)
Arianna: Okay so Vegita are you going to- what is THAT?!
Rei: My EVA.  Anyone still has a problem, take it up with her.
Sammy: Wait a minute!!!!
All: What?
Sammy: IF she smashed through the wall ...that means!  There's a 
possible exit?
Scimitar:(beaming) Freedom!
(Sammy's already off and running with Scimitar right behind)
(A force field appears where the hole is)
Scimitar: OOF!
(Sammy slams against it)
Sammy: So...sooo close...oooo...(Seeing stars)
(The whole room is in argument.  Ksa keeps pushing Vegita, Rei is 
looking menacing with the Eva, and Scimitar won't stop hitting on 
the girls (except for Misa))
Arianna: This is madness...
Ryoga: You said it.
Ryu: Ohhhhh what a sleep!
Arianna: (screams) Nooooo!
Rei: You should have stayed dead.
(Ksa falls over laughing at Arianna)
Ryu: Awww come on that was just a little love slap from Veggi.
(Arianna and Sammy form sweatbeads)
All: (facefault) 
Alex:  Before anyone else gets killed, I'm starting the fic again. (he 
hits play on the VCR)
Ksa: Please, do. I think we need it.
Arianna: Ooo someone create a diversion!
(Ryu dances the Macarena)
Arianna: Um...Ryu...?
Ryu: Heeeeeey Macarena.
Arianna: SIT DOWN!
(The tape starts to roll)

>Sasami moaned and sighed
>as the tentacles inside her continued to rape her young body. 
>Kagato pressed a key on his touchpad and all hell broke lose.
>    More metallic tentacles descended from the cluster above
>Sasami's table. The new ones were equiped with unimaginable
>devices of torture. Phalluses of every shape and size. Long
>needles and blades that were shiny and viciously sharp.

Ryoga:(to Ksa) You had to ask, didn't you?!
Vegita: Pretz had to learn that the hard way, too.  Maybe next time 
you won't say anything!

>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as she watched the torture tentacles
>descend to her body. They encircled her with their twisted 
>devices and slowly nodded at her as if to taunt her with
>lust and torture.
>   Two tentacles with nasty looking clamps descended on her
>breasts. The clamps fit perfectly around Sasami's hard pink
>nipples. She looked up at the screen above her and watched
>in horrific anticipation of what would happen.

All:(bracing for what may happen)

>   Without warning, two sharp steel spikes pierced her nipples.

All: 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
EEEE!!!!!!!!
(Ryu throws his bag of popcorn into the air and screams as well)
Sammy and Arianna:
OOOOOOOOUCCCCCCCHHHHHH!!
(Sammy and Arianna's hands fly to their chests)
Makoto and Misa: ACK!
(They both fall to the ground clutching their chests)

>Sasami screamed out loud and tensed her muscles in agony. The
>clamps inserted a long steel nail into each nipple and blood 
>gushed from the puncture wounds. 

Rei:(holding chest) I don't care how sick you are, you don't ever go 
there in a lemon!
Ksa: Or any other kinda fic, now that I think of it.
Sammy: Agreed...especially with a little girl like Sasami!
Ryu: That's wrong...
Senichi: Even I wouldn't go that far.
Vegita: Well that's comforting...

>The tentacles rose from her
>chest, leaving the two silver spikes inserted into her breasts.
>    The silver nails stung terribly and Sasami moaned in pain and
>confusion. Another tentacle like the first two descended to
>her spread pussy. 

Ksa: He can't!
Vegita: (wincing) He can...

>It clamped down on her clit and squeezed.

Scimitar: He wouldn't!
Makoto: (crying) He would...

>Sasami squirmed violently and the tentacles held her tight.
>The tentacle clamp pierced Sasami's clit with a silver steel
>nail just like the ones that punctured her breats. 

Ryoga: He did!
Sammy and Arianna: AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
(Makoto and Misa are on the floor crying in pain)

>   "AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!"Sasami screamed at the top of her lungs
>as a feeling like fire burned her clit. The pain was 
>excrusiating. 

Rei:(hands on lap, legs crossed) 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

>   Suddenly, her restraints we unlocked and her hands came free
>from the table. 

Ksa: (Kagato) now that I tagged you, run free Sasami, and frolic with 
the rest of the herd.
Scimitar: Actually, that would be pretty funny.
(Ryu snickers)

>The tentacles held her tightly in their grip
>and slowly turned her over onto her stomach. Sasami struggled
>and fought with the metal worms, but whe was held fast.

All: C'mon!
Ryoga: What else can he do to her?!
Sammy: Shutupshutupshutup Ryoga!! Don't EVEN ASK!!
Vegita: Great, now something WORSE is going to happen!!!!

>   She moaned as she lay face down on the table. Her cheek sat 
>in a little pool of a mixture of her own blood and saliva. 

Rei: So, he's just gonna drown her in her own blood?
Arianna: He's going to do much worse than that...
Ryu: I thought Sasami already drowned in her blood once?
Sammy: That was a dream... (Facevaults)

>The clamps locked her wrists and ankles again, keeping her trapped
>to the torture table. A tentacle wrapped itself around her waist 
>and lifted her ass into the air while forcing her head to lie on 
>the table. 

Ksa: Oh god!
Scimitar: This is too goddamn much!
Ryoga: Come back Tank Cop, all is forgiven. (gets bashed by Rei)
Rei: No, it isn't!
Alex: That reminds me... he asked us to MST his fics as well.  You 
know him well Ksa, should we?

>The soft flesh of her young ass was bare and exposed
>to the tentacles now. 

All: Please, god, no!
Sammy: Told ya... (Sinks into her chair)
Vegita: Never, ever, ever, ever, give a villain ideas!

>   Two of them spread her ass cheeks and held them open to attack.
>A third vibrating phallus slipped wetly across Sasami's back.
>She moaned in pain and exhaustion, nearly unconcious and feeling
>the painful burning sting of the steel needles in her nipples
>and clit.

Rei: (clutching herself) Did they have to remind us?
Arianna: This author is on my deathlist........(She and Sammy sink into 
their seats, holding themselves with their legs crossed)
Vegita: Oh, he's on mine too.
Senichi: Considering that you just learned how to kill might help.

>  The snake-like metal probe tickled her exposed asshole and 
>slowly began to penetrate Sasami's back door. 

Ksa: Don't go there!
Vegita: Look!  I told you not to give him ideas!

>She winced in
>pain as it slipped wetly into her tight ass, probing and
>tickling all the way. 

Ksa: He went there.
Vegita: See what it gets you!?

>It writhed and squirmed inside her
>colon, pushing in farther and farther. 
>  Sasami's cheeks flushed redly. She was so tired and hurt,
>but she still knew that Kagato was watching her rape-torture
>and loving every second.
>   The anal tentacle rape continued as the worm explored deeper
>into her cavaties. 

Scimitar: (worm) Dear god, it stinks in here!  Where am- Oh, god, not 
another anal rape scene.  You know I hate this stuff!
Makoto: Okay, that was a little vile.
Misa: I think disgusting is the word you're looking for.

>It reamed and pumped her tight ass as blood
>trickled down her thighs from her torn anus. Sasami sighed 
>deeply and moaned, eyes half shut.

Rei: I'm starting to hurt from this fic.
Sammy and Arianna: We feel your pain...
Others: As do we...
 
>   The tentacle began to vibrate and pump her ass with greater 
>speed. More tentacles went to work on Sasami, poking at the
>steel spikes in her nipples, causing her to wince. 

Rei: NO MORE!!
Ryoga: Whats with her? She seems more active then usual.
Ksa: She's a girl, and every female part has been made to suffer 
horribly in this fic.
Scimitar: How do you think she feels?
Ryoga: Oh. So, the butt is a female part?
(They all jump him)

>Tears 
>welled at her eyes and she yelped as a vibrating clamp attached
>itself to the clit spike and began to torture her pierced flesh.

Ksa: Dear god al-
Scimitar: Holy sh-
Rei: Why m-
Ryoga: Ranma, prepare to di- (notices the others glaring at him) 
never mind...

>   Her clit felt like it was on fire as the clamp vibrated the
>clit spike. Her nipples burned redly as the vibro-clamps tortured
>her soft tits. A small stream of blood droplets trickled from her
>impaled, violated tits. 

Ryoga: She's just a little girl, this is too much.
Ksa: I think that she should have passed out after the first 20 
seconds of this fic.
Ryu: Blagh...(Slips the popcorn bag over his head)
Akito: Ryu? Can't watch!? Behold the wonder!
Ryu: Shutup Akito!
Alex: Actually, I'm surprised, none of you have puked on the floor yet.
Senichi: (clutching his mouth) Doesn't mean we won't soon...

>A red pool was collecting beneath her on 
>the torture table.
>   The anal tentacle thrust deeply into her and out again, making
>Sasami squeal and clutch at the table. The clit clamp vibrated 
>faster, sending hot flashes of pain and pleasure through her body.

Rei: (very P.O.'ed) WHERE THE GODDAMN HELL IS THE PLEASURE IN 
THIS FIC!? HUH?! WHERE?!
(The others back away, slowly and easy)
Senichi: Well technically...
(Everyone else glares at him with energy crackling everywhere)
Senichi: Nevermind...

>Her nipples burned and ached as the clamps twisted the needles 
>inside her. She screamed again as the needles twisted and rotated.

Rei: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! NOT AGAIN!
Makoto: ARGH... This is terrible...
Sammy: NO! This is torture!!

>Sasami was in terrible agony. Her little tits felt like they
>were on fire. 
>   She felt her clit burn with screaming pleasure as the tentacle
>clamp vibrated the clit needle. Her pussy spasmed and her anus
>contracted, squeezing the tentacle in her ass. She felt herself
>drifting off, losing concious control and seperating herself from
>her own body. 

Ryoga: With this fic, that would be a good thing.
Misa: PLEASE LET HER DIE!!!

>   Her clit screamed with pleasure as the vibration continued. 
>She closed her eyes, lifted her head and moaned softly. She arched 
>her back and cried out "OOOOOoooohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!" 

Scimitar: My god, Kagato made her into a monkey! (Others glance 
nervously at him)

>as she climaxed 
>violently.
>   The tentacle in her ass twisted and pumped, insulting her tight
>asshole as her hot orgasm tore through her. The tentacle clamps
>pulled viciously at her nipple piercings, stretching her young
>blood-stained tits. 

Rei: Please, no, please, just don't-
Vegita: You are asking for it...

>As Sasami screamed in orgasm and pain,
>the tentacle clamps powerfully yanked the nipple needles from 
>her tits. 

Rei, Makoto, and Misa: 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

>They violently ripped from her nipples, tearing huge, deep
>gashes in her tits as they exited her flesh.

>   Sasami gasped and gagged in pain as her screaming orgasm
>subsided. 

Arianna: (As the screaming orgasm) EEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYAAAAHHH!
Ryu: Ouch...(touches his ear lightly)
Ksa: So, not only did he torture her, he served her beverages too!
Others: Shut up, Ksa!
Misa: Vegita, I'm surprised, you didn't blast Ksa.
Vegita: Well, I would have, but his power level seems to be a lot 
higher than mine.

>Her breasts hurt like the devil. Blood cascaded 
>from her chest and covered the table below her. She sighed
>deeply, then collapsed into unconciousness....

Sammy: THANK GOD!
Misa: Please let her be dead...

>  Kagato smiled and retracted the tentacles from her body. The 
slimey
>metal worms were covered in blood, saliva and cum. 

(All stomachs lurch)
Ryu: No more popcorn for me at these lemons....oiii...

>Sasami lay on
>the table, motionless. Kagato checked her bio-readout and saw that
>she was still alive. Good, he thought, we'll have some more fun 
>later sweet one...

Rei: I doubt she woulda lived through that!
Ksa: Where the hell is Tsunami? Wouldn't she have stopped this?
Akito: That's nice of her ...
Ryu: (Tsunami) Sasami as you know...we're joined as one and I know 
this has made you very unhappy so I'll be leaving now...(exits as 
Kagato starts to torture Sasami)
Sammy: So THAT'S what happened to Tsunami...

>   He walked past the torture table, leaving Sasami in a pathetic
>heap. He opened a side door and exited the torture room, leaving
>the mess behind him.

Scimitar: C'mon, even a villain should clean up after himself.
Ryu: Okaaay Martha Stewart...

>   The new room he entered was exactly like the first. Accross the
>room was a torture table exactly like Sasami's. Lying face up on
>the table was another woman, clamped down the way Sasami had 
been.
>Kagato strode brazenly up to the new victim and looked her in the
>eyes.
>   "Shall we begin my dear, dear Aeka?" He laughed evilly and
>went to work again....

All: AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!


>THE END?

All: We hope so!
Ksa: Wait, if he's doing this to everyone... then would he-
Scimitar: Don't suggest it Ksa.
Ryoga: Suggest what?
Scimitar: That Tenchi will be the victim in the sequel to this
Rei & Ryoga: GAH!
Ryu: Nasty!
Vegita: You asked for it... now it will probably happen!!!
(Sammy, Arianna and Akito are already running to escape the 
theater)

Akito: How creative...(Jots downs the address then grins darkly)
Ksa: Full credit my ass!
Scimitar: More like a full firing squad!
Arianna: FULL SCALE ATTACK! LET'S GO!
Sammy: Right! 
Alex: Wait!  How exactly do you plan on getting back?
(Both stop)
Arianna: Oh man...you WILL send us back..........right? (Gulp)
Ryu: Oh man! Bummer! I liked hangin with Veggi!
Akito: Uh...Ryu I don't think Vegita likes that nickname...
Ryu: Suuuuure he does!! Dontcha Veggi (drapes an arm around Vegita)
(Sammy covers her eyes and Arianna bows her head)
Vegita: I warned you... (He sends his fist straight through Ryu's head, 
killing him again)  Ah, I love my new abilities.  (He shakes off the 
blood and gore from his glove)  I have to admit, there were a bit 
more brains than I expected.
Sammy: Oh my god!
Akito: You killed Ryu!
(There is a long pause as they look at Arianna)
Arianna: What?  I don't care if he's dead!
Alex: (blinks in disbelief) Well, you should take the body anyway...
Sammy: I guess so.
Arianna: Vegita, I would like to thank you for the great favor you 
have done us.
Vegita: (smiling) DonOt mention it.
Alex: Well, I guess I can send you back now.  Good luck with all of 
your future MSTs!  (He waves his hands a bit and Sammy, Arianna, 
Akito, and Ryu corpse (and pieces thereof) all vanish).
Scimitar: Hey!  What about us?
Alex: Well, I'll send you guys back, but I want to know what you 
thought of it first.
Rei: The fic itself, or the team-up? 
Alex: Both actually...
Ryoga: I'll go first.
Alex: All right.
Ryoga: It had to be the one of the worst cases of sickness in fanfic 
history. The torture scenes were horrifying, and the general thought 
of some human thinking this up is disturbing. 
Scimitar: (waving hand in air) Me next. Me next!
Vegita: Geeze, go ahead!
Scimitar: Watch it, bud! (growls)
Vegita: (cracks his knuckels) Wanna take it outside?
Scimitar: (Ignoring the Saiya-jin) Anyway, the thing that bothered 
me was the whole idea of Kagato doing this. I mean, he died. I'd 
confirm it if there were any pieces.
Senichi: Good point.  Although I remember hearing somewhere that 
Kagato said "You've won boy, for now."
Scimitar: Nit-picker
Rei: My turn. The fact that this guy knew enough about the female 
body to think of ways to torture just disturbs me.
(Senichi beings to speak, but thinks better and keeps quiet.)
Ksa: Well, what I can say that the others haven't, is that if this 
person calls themself "Washu", then that means it's a female herself. 
The thought of a girl thinking of this is worse.
Alex: Actually, I think that's just a pen-name so that we can't hunt 
him/her/it down...
Ksa: Smart pervert.
Alex: I would like to reference Leaf-chan...
Ksa's crew: NOOO!!
Ksa: Just let us leave!
Scimitar: PLEASE! (tears stream down his face comically)
(Vegita, Senichi, Makoto, and Pixy Misa look at Alex.)
Alex: Don't worry, I'm pretty sure NO ONE will ever force people to 
MST it.
(Sounds of a cow mooing in the silence)
Makoto: Huh?  Where did a cow come from?
Misa: Yeah, I thought wolves were supposed to break the silence.
Senichi: Exactly... cows are supposed to break wind!
Scimitar: OOKAMI RECCA HA! (blasts Senichi)
(Senichi drops to the ground, badly burned, but still alive)
Alex: Hey, don't kill my MSTers...
Vegita: Yeah!  That's my job!
Xelloss: (appearing) And I thought the censoring made you soft, 
Vegita-chan! ^_^
Ksa's crew: WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!
Xel: Well, I couldn't just watch the fic with you. Even I have my 
limits. ^_^
Ksa: Damn bastard... 
Alex: And more importantly, how did you get here???
Xel: Sore wa himitsu desu! ^_~
Ksa: I'm surprised Vegita hasn't flipped yet.
Vegita: (trying to contain his rage) His... power... level... exceeds... 
my... own!!!
Xel: Aww, you're trembling. How kawaii! (gives Vegita a Bugs Bunny 
style kiss on the face) ^_~
Ksa's Crew: AAAAHH! YOU FRUITCAKE!!
Alex: Xelloss, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  You're upsetting 
Vegita.
Xel: Ok. Bye Vegita-chan! ^_~ (Xelloss disappears)
(Vegita stares forward in shock.)
Ksa: He has that affect on people.
Alex: Well, Ksa, it's been great having you all here.
Ksa's crew: Well, ja ne!
Alex: Fare well, perhaps we'll do another MST together... someday... 
(He waves his hands and Ksa, Rei, Scimitar, and Ryoga all vanish.)
Senichi: (Climbs back up) They gone?
Alex: Yeah, I sent them back.  So, what did you guys think of the fic?
Vegita: If I ever get my hands on the author I'll kill him!  (He thinks a 
bit.)  Kill!  Kill!  DIE, AUTHOR, DIE!!!  (He starts laughing manically.)
Misa: He's still not over the fact that he can say "kill" is he?
Makoto: Give it time.
Senichi: Well, this fic went too far, even for me.
Alex: Thank me for that!
(The others look at him, quite puzzled.)
Alex: What?  I AM a god!  You think I would worship someone else?
(The others groan.)

*****************************************************

	The lights in the theater came back on and everyone exited 
back into the lobby.
	Makoto sat down in a chair and put her head in her hands.  "I'm 
not going to get any sleep tonight."
	Pixy Misa walked up next to her.  "I know what you mean."
	Vegita floated over to his usual spot by the window and sat 
down, looking out at the sky and thinking of returning to fight 
Captain Ginyu.
	Senichi and Alexander exited the theater and stood up against 
the wall.
	Alexander commented, "Well, we've finished another one.  
Vegita, I'll send you back to your battle after we're done talking."
	Vegita nodded.
	"However," Alexander turned to the others, "since all of your 
series have ended, would you like to stay here?  I've got some nice 
accommodations."
	Pixy Misa nodded.  "I guess I could stay here until we finish our 
MSTing crusade.  But I may need to go back to help Pretty Sammy."
	Senichi looked around and said, "Well, business is slow right 
now, I guess I could take some time off."
	Makoto commented, "Well, seeing as how there is no evil left in 
Japan, I guess I can stay."
	Alexander looked and them and smiled, "I'm glad you all agree 
to stay.  It will make rounding you up so much easier.  Oh, and 
Vegita, I promise I won't steal you away again until after either you 
or Frieza dies, okay?"
	Vegita nodded.  He then shouted, "What do you mean after 
Frieza or I die?"
	Looking around and playing innocent Alexander said, "Oh... 
nothing!"
	Vegita began to power up but Alexander waved his hands and 
sent him back to his epic battle.
	"So boys and girls," Alexander started, "make yourselves at 
home."  Everyone nodded and left the theater.

*****************************************************

	The chair swivels around once again.  "Well, I hope you have 
enjoyed this MSTing of 'Kagato's Revenge.'  If you didn't like it, I 
don't blame you.  This fic is sick.  If you're reading this far, you're 
really devoted to MSTs.  On behalf of myself and my two co-authors, 
I would like to thank you for reading this VERY long MST.  It took us 
six months to get this together and finally 'publish' it, but we think 
it was worth it.  If you have any comments you can send them to 
crusader_esper@hotmail.com.  Thank you all for watching."  The 
chair turns around and the room goes dark.
