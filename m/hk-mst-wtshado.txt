"Author's note:Since we are MSTing a Tenchi fic and the Tenchi cast are
MSTing The<>
sign are the MST characters.

In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki, who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!
Ryoko:Rock On
Washu:I'm a genius
Ayeka:TENCHI
Tsunami: I love trees
Mihoshi:I want eggplant!!!
Ryo-ohki:MEOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
If you are wondering how they eat or breathe, or other science facts,
Repeat to yourself it's just a fic and you really should relax,
For Tenchi-Muyo theater 4000

(Inside Starship-Ryo-Oki)

<Tenchi>I'm so bored
::Washu walks in::
<Washu>Hi Tenchi,I was bored also, I made mecha chibis of everyone.
<Tenchi>YOU DID WHAT?!?WWWAAAASSSSHHHUUUU!!!!!!
<Washu>Yep,that's right.
::Ryoko and Tsunami walk in::
<Ryoko chibiA>Ryoko,you're so great!
<Ryoko chibiB>Ryoko,you're so tough!
<Ryoko>Yes! I love this!
::Mihoshi walks in::
<Mihoshi>I just finished watching the baseball game. The Mets lost.
So, I was wondering if we can have a baseball game ourselves. Please, pretty
please?
<Tsunami>I don't see why not.
<Washu>We don't have enough people to play baseball. We need
two teams of nine!
<Mihoshi> Couldn't we use the chibis as the other team?
<Mihoshi chibiA>You're the smartest,Mihoshi!
<Tsunami>Hahahahaha, good joke.
::Ayeka walks in looking peeved::
<Ayeka>I WAS ATTACKED BY A MINIATURE RYOKO, WHAT'S THIS
ABOUT,WASHU???
<Washu>Ayeka?
<Ayeka>WHAT?
<Washu>Can you call me Little Washu?
<Ayeka>AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
::At that, all the chibis start chasing the Tenchi chibis.
<Tench chibis A&B>AHHHHHHHHH
::A screen appears showing doctor Clay::
<Clay>This might as well be the most OOC fic
I have ever sent you, but you may enjoy it more than I do.Enjoy.
Mwahahahaha!
::Screen disappears::
<Tsunami>I hate him sooooooooo much it's not funny.
<Tenchi>WE HAVE FANFIC SIGN!!!!!
::Usual fanfic sign chaos::
<Washu>Okay. I'll program the baseball field while you guys are gone.
<Tsunami>Okay.
::Tsunami, Ryoko, and Mihoshi run into the theatre::

Why Tsunami Should Have A Day Off by Cyber Hyena

(Disclaimer: I don't own Tenchi Muyo! or any jokes from Ren & Stimpy. I
don't make
any money off of this.)

Tusanami's day was, to be blunt, unpleasent. The Jurian millitary had been
depending her for their small war on a neighboring planet.

<Tsunami>Take that, neighboring planet.
<Ryoko>Yes, eat wooden space death.

They were fighting day and night, and the multiverse godess was suffering
more than any
of the soldiers on duty. She hadn't slept in weeks, this morning she had
been interrupted
while having her daily bowl of Juria-O's.

<Ryoko>I guess Sasami loses the ability to cook when she merges with
Tsunami.
<Tsunami>I'm collecting the boxtops. You can send them in for a free
T-shirt.
<Ryoko>Oh. What's the major ingredient, prozac?
<Tsunami>You guessed it.
<Ryoko>No wonder you're always so laid back about everything. . .
<Mihoshi>Free T-shirt! Wow!

the the next came when she was tending the garden, now her flowers were
drooping. Her
mind was slowy wearing down like paint being striped off by a power sander.
The sweat
on her fore head stopped pouring as she helped the fleet press opressing
atackers back out
of the planet's atmospheare. She slumped down in her lazy tree and let out a
small sigh of
intense relief. The dementional pool shimered as Tsunami's favoret episode
of Seinfeld
came on.

<Ryoko>Dementional pool. Somehow that seems like an appropriate thing to
watch
Seinfeld on.
<Mihoshi>They have Seinfeld on Jurai?
<Tsunami>Our version is a little different. Instead of a show about nothing,
it's a show
about trees.
<Ryoko>Hey, what is it about you talking so slow like that? Do you channel
Al Gore or
something?
<Tsunami>The being now known as Al Gore used to be one of my saplings.
<Ryoko>Hm, that explains why everyone says he's so wooden.

"Ah, just what I needed. Krammer, you never fail to amuse me. *sigh*"

<Mihoshi>Kramer!

She sat back and watched the never ending satire of the American sit-com.
She
started to grin and would have laughed at the next sceen, if she didn't
suddenly get hit by
a great mental force. "Not again!" she moaned as the pool shifted to show
a large space battle. "Pompous bastards can't even stop fighting for a
hour!!! They
draining all my freaking energy!!!"she screamed across the Jurian Empire.

<Tsunami>Yes, how dare they interrupt my Seinfeld viewing with their life or
death
struggle.
<Ryoko>Three letters. V. C. R.
<Mihoshi>CPR? I don't get it, Ryoko!

As she powered the ships durnig the battle,

<Mihoshi>Durnig? What kind of word is that?::Scratches head::

the strain, and the fact she was missing an episode she had been trying to
watch since the
show aired, snapped Tusnami like a twig under the wight of a mac truck. Her
blood
chilling scream could be heard ringing out into the ferthest reaches of the
galaxy.

<Ryoko>Sounds like it's that time of the month. Do trees get that?
<Tsunami>Some things are not to be told.
<Ryoko>So, in other words, yes.

At the same time Sasami was cheerfuly preparing lunch for the family, when
Tsunami's shriek sent her reeling. Sasami_Go_To_Washu's_Lab……

<Ryoko>It's all you can eat night!

Sasami obedently headed for the home of the Universes Greatest Gineuess
Scientist. Washu imeadatly noticed the little blue haired princess and let
out an
agrivated sigh. "I know, lunch is ready, I'll be there in a sec."Washu said
trying to second
guess her. "No, actualy Tusnami wants to talk to you." Sasami replied
brightly. She closed her eyes and Tusnami apeared before the mad scientist.

<Tsunami>(to fic Washu)Could I borrow a cup of sugar? I feel like going
chibi and
attacking everyone.
<Ryoko>Wouldn't you just turn into Sasami if you went on a sugar rush?
<Tsunami>Yeah, but there'd be two Sasamis and that would be sort of
interesting.
<Ryoko>(Pictures two of Sasami running around doing kawaii things)Ugh. . . .
that is
more disturbing than this weird OOC fic.

The godess stood there for a minute, breathing heavaly, then she rushed
Washu,
grabbed the little woman and shook her. "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tsunami yelled in Washu's face.

<Mihoshi>Say it, don't spray it.

"Easy Tsu. Easy! What's the problem?"
"I've been running the Jurian space fleet for eons, but, yesterday, was the
last straw!!!!
They interuped me while I was watching Seinfeld!!! Do you have any idea
how long I was waiting for yesterday's episode?!! DO YOU?!!!!! They need to
stop
fighting!!!" Washu knew it took a realy brave or very foolish person(s) to
come between the Multiverse godess and her Seinfeld time. She was guessing
that the
latter was usaly the type, to call upon a woman who could wipe them out in
an instent

<Tsunami>This is so in character. I really am a psycho bitch who is willing
to wipe out
her own people over missing a tv show.
<Mihoshi>Yeah, the show must be getting it wrong.
<Ryoko>Hm, I actually kind of like this Tsunami a little better. . .

Washu led Tsunami to a small room in the corner, where an extreamly
comoftable
cot. She layed the other woman on it and propped the pillows.

<Tsunami>Uh-oh.
<Ryoko>Relax, I think we're ok this time.

Turned on a cd player with soothing music on it. "Now you lay there and
relax, and so
you can,I'll turn off the gravity." She flipped a switch on the wall and
left quietly, after a
few seconds, Tsunami floated off the bed. She was half smiling. Maybe the
little luntic is
right, I should take it easy. She reached over and grabbed a blanket,
and tighly hugged it. "My blanket..you've always been good to me. It's
always been you
and I agenst the world! No one else can have you, you all mi-ne!"

<Ryoko>What the heck is going on here?
<Mihoshi>Don't you know anything? This is the Ren and Stimpy part.
<Tsunami>I'm apparantly having post traumatic stress disorder which is
causing me to
channel Ren Hoek,
<Mihoshi>Ren!
<Ryoko>But what does Ren and Stimpy have to do with our show?
<Mihoshi>Beats me.
<Tsunami>(ponders the Keone and Mihoshi show)Hmmmmm . . . . .

As she conuined to soflty rant, she unintentionaly sailed out of the room
and around the
lab, Washu's ears perked and she turned away from her holo labtop and
proptly
face faulted.

"Uh..Tsunami?" She asked meekly. "NO!!!! Ever since I was a little tree,
everyone's been trying to take my blankie!!!!!! WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE
IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" She possively clutched the blanket and sucked her thumb.
"Now just hand
over the coforter and we'll talk over a nice cup of tea laced with a
seditive…." "STAY BACK, MAN!!!!!!"

<Tsunami>That's not a woman, it's a man, man.
<Ryoko>Hey, the tree goddess laying down some Powers lines.
<Tsunami>I wish I'd have said "I shall call her. . . mini-me" when I first
assimilated
Sasami. That would have been cool.
<Ryoko>Hindsight is 20/20.

The godess screamed and backed into wall, wildly looking around, then she
snatched a
vile of a green liquid. "Please
calme down, and put down the dangerous chemical.." Washu said in a
talking-to-a-
raving-phycopath-voice. "DON'T MAKE ME USE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" She
began to laugh manicaly and shook the beaker up and down violently.

<Ryoko>As gripping as this is, let's see if they're ready for the game out
there.

::They leave the theatre and walk onto a baseball diamond, the rest are
already
on the diamond::

<WashuChibiB(wearing umpire suit)>Let's play ball!
<Ayeka>First we must sing the Juraian planetary anthem.
<Ryoko>Oh, crud.
<Ayeka>Well, we can sing the anthem of wherever you're from, Ryoko. Oh,
sorry, I
forgot, you don't even *have* a home, really.
<Ryoko>That's it!
::Ryoko shoots an energy ball at Ayeka, which she deflects.::
<Ayeka>How can you be so irrational, Ryoko! If you don't stop this, I will
never forgive
you.
<Ryoko>WHAT?
<Ayeka>Just adding to the OOC.
<Ryoko>Oh, all right, you can have your stupid anthem.
<Ayeka>Here it goes:

"Sing to the trees of wisdom"
"The power of our trees will crush our enemies"
"Hail the royalty of Jurai"
"For with someone out of their family they will never ever lie"

<Tenchi>That's it?
<Ayeka>That song is about me and Tenchi.
<Ryoko>::Almost pukes::
<Washu chibiA>Play ball!!!
<Kione appears,along with Sakuya and Sasami>
<Kione>Can we play?
<Washu>Sure
<Sakuya>Cool!
::The chibis take position in the dugout,and the cast
take their positions in the field,these are what they are::

C:Tsunami
1B:Tenchi
2B:Ayeka
SS:Washu
3B:Mihoshi
P:Kione
RF:Sakuya
LF:Sasami
CF:Ryoko

::The game runs only five innings because nobody feels like playing a full
game. Ryoko
got yelled at a few times for teleporting and walking through the center
field wall and the
Chibis eventually won (they don't get tired, you know).

<Washu>Well, that was fun
<EveryoneElse>(gasping for air)No . . . . . .
<Chibis>YAYYY!!!!!
(Two of the Chibis dump a bottle of sake on Washu's head and start chasing
the real and
chibi Tenchis again)
<Tenchis>Aggghhhhhhhh!
<Washu>*Sigh* ::presses a button on a remote control::
::The Chibis immediately fly over to the real versions of themselves and
start buttering
them up::
<AyekaChibiA>You're so pretty, Ayeka!
<AyekaChibiB>You're so restrained, Ayeka!
<SasamiChibiA>You're so cute, Sas-
<Sasami>No time for this now, we have fanfiction sign!
::In the chaos, Tsunami, Ryoko and Mihoshi return to the theatre.::

Washu jumped her and the two women wrestled around until the diminuntive
scientist
wrung the vilal out of the wigged out Tsunami's hands. She then slapped her
across the
face. Then the blue haired tree began to sob uncontrollably.

<Tsunami>All of this sort of blows the whole 'gentle' reputation I had. . .
<Ryoko>Might as well go with the flow.
<Tsunami>I'll try. (as Ren)Stieeempy! You eeeeediooot!
<Ryoko>There ya go.

Later Tsunami sat in the onsen's bubbly waters, trying to regane her
composure.
Her mouth and the corners of her lips twitched slightly. It's not my fault
this is happening, it's someone's, but I don't kow who to blame. She sunk
lower into the
water. I need a scapegoat, but who?…………………I've got it!!!!!!!
She lept out of the water and dressed her self, running in search of a
certain 18 year old
boy.

<Tsunami>Hm, I would have thought of OJ as a scapegoat first.
<Ryoko>Yeah, you can pin anything on OJ these days.

***********

At this time, Tenchi was curently sittling on the steps of the shrine with
Ryoko.
She was siding up to him every second and leaned her head agenst his
shoulder. "Tenchi, I've been meaning to ask you…..who do you like?" "Well
uh…."
"Why don't you kiss me and see?" She closed her eyes and puckered up.
Tenchi sweat dropped and leaned forword to kiss, but was suddenly pulled
away by
Tsunami. Then the author apeared.

"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not belong in this story(since I should be
writing
it,)………….BUT I CAN'T PASS UP A CHANCE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!" He
leapt forword, grabbed Ryoko by the neck and kissed her passionatly.
"YAHOOO!!!!!"
He screamed with joy then, disapeared. "Hmm, not bad, but I never knew
Tenchi ate beef jerky…"

<Tsunami>That was the most pointless and sad self insertion I've ever seen.
<Mihoshi>This is nothing compared to the fic where the guy had himself in
bed with
both Washu *and* Android-18.
<Ryoko>No comment.

***********

Tenchi found himself in Juria's Royal Garden, Tsunami beckoned him to follow
her, grinning evily. She led him to a large tree with a panal in front of
it, upon
it was a single push button labled, DO NOT PRESS,UNLESS YOU REALY MEAN IT!!
JURAI DETONATOR BUTTON.Tsunami quickly ripped the lable off and
ate it.

<Tsunami>Jurai detonator button. *Really*.
<Ryoko>Wow, I wish I'd known about that. All that effort for nothing.

" See that button, Tenchi?" she asked. "Yes, what does it do?" "Nobody
knows!!!! Maaayyybeee somethin' good, maaaayyybeeee somethin' bad! We're
not gonna find out because your gonna gaurd it!!" She empised this by
jabbing her finger
into his chest. She walked away and his behind a tree. Tenchi stood there
holding tenchi-ken and vigilantly scaned the room, then his right eye fell
upon the button.
I wonder what it does? He thought. Maybe I should push it and find
out…No! I'm not susposed to touch it!!! But, it looks so inocent, wait! NO!
Can't_Give_IN………

<Mihoshi>I can see where this is headed.
<Tsunami>Um, wouldn't destroying Jurai destroy me as well?
<Ryoko>Yeah, but that's not the point of this fic.
<Tsunami>You mean this fic actually has a point?
<Ryoko>Yes. But it temporarily eludes me.

"How much longer can our hero stand the pressure?!!!!! Hoe much time before
he surcumbs to the temptation?!!!!! To press that button, that shiny button,
that suductive button, that almost candy like button!!!!!!!!!!!" The anoucer
began to
scream, and as he began to slam Tenchi's face into the button, then hefted
him
up on the panal and began to roll him across the device. "How Much Longer
Can He
Stand It?!!!! How Much Longer?!!!!!! HOW MUCH LONGER?!!!!!!!" "I
CAN'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Tenchi screamed knocking the anoying anoucer off
him. He
laughed insainly and slammed his finger down on the button, and waring
sirens blared, as the planet avacuated. Tusnami took up the role of laughing
insainly as
Tenchi fainted. The Jurians made it of planet just as it blew up.

<Ryoko>How GI-Joe-esque.
<Tsunami>What do you mean?
<Ryoko>I don't think anyone ever died on that show, either.

A triple exploshion set off a chain reaction of dystruction on the surface
then, the entire
planet phased out in a brilent and blinding flash of ultravilent light, like
a fire works
display gone horriably wrong

<Tsunami>This whole fic went horribly wrong.
<Mihoshi>I liked it! Ren and Stimpy is funny!
<Ryoko>I liked the part when Jurai blew up, so I guess it's ok.

**********

Epiloge

A warm breaze flutered over the French Riviara as the sun shown blaringly.
The
weather was pleasant and soothing as the waves lazly relfected on the layed
back mood. Tsunami sat back in her beach chair sipping upon a ice cold wine
cooler.
Next to her Washu stretched out, taning her face. "I'm glad to see you back
to
good meantal health." "Thanks, I need to take a well deserved vacation every
thousand
years." "Good, now who do you sucker into taking your place on New
Jurai?" "Oh someone who deserves that deserves the postion."

Vegeta sat , wearing a black cape with his usal aromor, he was curnetly
watching
Indiana Jones and trying to figure out his power leval,

<Ryoko>(as Vegeta)I could take that wuss.

when the Jurians called upon him. "What the hell?!!! No! No! NO!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

*********

"Well that's a rap.."

"Waite a minute, kid"

"Oh hi Ryoko."

"Yeah, hi. Listen, I like that kiss and your nice but, the next time you
pull that, I'll force
you to kiss your ass. Okay?"

<Ryoko>I liked his nice butt? What?
<Tsunami>Someone seems to need 'hooked on phonics' badly.
<Mihoshi>I used to use that, but I got addicted and had to go into recovery.
<Ryoko>Let's get out of here.

"Clear as crystle. Okay, now review me and read something else, It's over.
Look for new
fics."

I do not own Tenchi and co. am not making any money

CyberHyena:please do not flame me.It was only a joke.Not to be taken
seriously
