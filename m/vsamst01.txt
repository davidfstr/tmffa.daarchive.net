MST #1
An MST of "Something Snapped part 1"

DISCLAIMER: My apologies to the following people and/or companies for
borrowing and/or creating parodies of their characters: Pioneer LDS, AIC, 
Best Brains Productions, Peter Suzuki (from whom I swiped this disclaimer
and intro [if you're going to swipe, swipe from one of the best, no?])(Thanks
 to Peter Suzuki himself for approval of it. I promise that I'll try to get a different
 start for the next one,  but just for the readers I'd recomend reading his MST's,
they really are about the best there are)and all others who would be insulted by 
this MST (original FanFic writer, optional).
___________________________________________________________

MST'd by the following people/beings:
CHARLES MORGAN (human male from Earth)
RRAXUS VIS (Ventrran male from Ventrra)
DARRVON DRE (Deskron male from Ventrra)
PENTRREKX ALEPH (Ventrran female from Ventrra)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	A balding human figure with long brown hair and moustache
stands before the camera and speaks, "A long, long time ago in a galaxy
far, far away..."
	"HEY!" another voice interrupts, "Do you think that we're stupid
or something?" A green skinned, table like figure walks into view. "That's the
intro to STAR WARS! This is an MST of a Tenchi Muyo FanFic,Charles.
Now be serious."
	"OK, OK! I'm sorry Rraxus." he looks around, "Say. Where are
Darrvon and Pentrrekx?"
	"They're looking at the 'FanFic Theatre' that you had us create.
By the way: What IS a FanFic theatre for? Shouldn't we just sit at our
computer terminals and read them?"
	"Not these FanFics. These stories are very special."
	"They're the best that your world has to offer?"
	"Oh, no. They're the WORST my world has to offer. They
are so bad that they are in a class by themselves." Charles smiled evilly
	"So why do we have to see them in a theatre?"
	"It's a tradition, ok?" Charles is fianlly getting exaspirated,
"Haven't you ever read any MST's? You know Anime Port 9, the MST
Avengers, Ksa and the MSTers, etc.?"
	Rraxus just stares at him.
	"Never mind." Charles sighs "Just come along and I'm sure that
you'll get the idea.

	Charles and Rraxus enter the theatre where Darrvon and
Pentrrekx are staring at the blank screen. Along the way, Charles notices
that every seat has a button next to it that says "START".
	"Excellent," he remarks "I can start the FanFic, but no one
can shut it off. This will work fine."
	Darrvon, upon hearing the remark, turns around and asks
Charles "Why can't we stop the story at some point?"
	"THAT is a secret." Charles replies, then asks, "Is everyone
ready to start the story?"
	All members of the MST crew state that they are and get seated
in some of the seats provided near the front. Charles presses a START 
button and the doors to the theatre shut and lock and the fic begins.

>Something Snapped

Pentrrekx: Probably the writer of this fic.

>--------------------------------

Darrvon: Cut here and dispose of everything below this part.
Charles: By the time this is finished you will probably wish you could.

>             I can't believe he just did what he did.

Pentrrekx: He left the toilet seat up AGAIN!
Darrvon: He marinated himself with gravy.
Rraxus: He wrote a terrible story.
Charles: He ran around naked in public.
OTHERS: EEEEWWWWW!
 
>             It's so... unexpected.

Charles: He decided to get pregnant and have a baby. ^_^
Rraxus: O_O Can human males do that?
Charles: (amine sweatdrop) Not hardly.

> But I should have realised something
>was up when he went to see Washuu so frequently during the past week.

Pentrrekx: (staring hard at Charles) Then again, knowing Washu's abilities
maybe he IS having a baby.
Charles: Um...I don't THINK that's what happens.

> I hate thinking about this, but I've got to add this to my diary.

Rraxus: I wonder who's supposed to be narrating this scene.
Darrvon: Happosai?
Pentrekx: I think that it would be more perverted.
 
>             First, he called me up to his room. 

Charles: (evilly smiling) OK! Now THIS is starting to sound like a
nicely perverted part!
OTHERS: Charles!

>             Oh! There goes Ryoko! She'll not be looking so happy
>soon...

Darrvon: Tenchi has decided to marry Aeka?
Rraxus: Tenchi decided to marry Washu?
Pentrekx:  Tenchi decided to marry Mihoshi?
Charles: Tenchi decided that he was too turned on by his own body
to marry any of them?
OTHERS:EEEEWWWWWW!
(Suddenly loggs appear out of nowhere and shoot out electricity
frying the MSTers except Darrvon.)
Rraxus, Pentrrekx, and Charles: *...ouch...*

>             "What is it, Ten-chan?" He was standing,

Rraxus: ...on his head.
Darrvon: ....in a pile of sh-aving cream. (realises what she just said) HEY!
What happened?! I got edited?
Charles: It happens all the time in anime. Sorry.

> and had a _very_
>serious look on his face. And he seemed to have changed the layout a
>bit. I didn't like this a bit.

Pentrrekx: It was very strange with the bed attatched to the ceiling.

>             "It's about you and Ryoko.

Charles: (Tenchi) I want to be a girl getting into a fight over someone!
Pentrrekx: (Aeka) Well Lord Tenchi if I'd known that, I could have
arranged it.
Charles: (Tenchi) No. Only WASHU can arrange me.
(The logs reappear and fry Charles and Pentrrekx)
Darrvon: Where do those logs come from anyway?

> I'm SICK and TIRED

Rraxus: (Tenchi) So I'm going back to bed right now!

> of you two
>always fighting over me and causing general HAVOC!"

Charles: As opposed to what? That's how the show goes.
Rraxus: Causing a general CALM would be kind of weird.

>             I began to get scared, and blustered. The way his voice
>just leapt in volume for those words... "I-I'm sorry..."

Pentrrekx:...that you haven't learned to put down the toilet seat.

>             "Not good enough."

Charles: (Tenchi) If I was a girl I wouldn't HAVE to know.

> He clapped his hands, twice, as if

Rraxus: ....he thought his lights were controlled by "the Clapper".

>commanding something. Two sets of mechanical tentacles whipped down from
>the ceiling of the room, binding themselves around my arms and legs,
>dragging me up towards a chair in the middle of the room. "Azaka!
>Kamidake! HELP!"

Darrvon: (Aeka) I'm stuck in a really awful fanfic!
Rraxus: (Aeka) I have to go to the little pricesses room!
Charles: (Aeka) I'm afraid Tenchi will have kinky, hot, passionate sex with
me and...WHAT AM I SAYING!
Pentrrekx: (disgusted) Boys!

>             "No use, princess. 

Rraxus: (Darth Vader) You don't know the power of the dark side.

>Washuu also generated a field which
>means that they cannot respond to your cries." With that, I found myself

Darrvon: (Aeka) ...being sent to another dimension.(pause) Huh?
Pentrrekx: (Aeka) ...out of this story and in a better one.
Charles: Ha! You wish!
Rraxus: Ha! We ALL wish

>thrust over the back of the chair, and, to my shame, he pushed his hand
>up my robe and pulled away my panties. I was sure that he was intending
>rape.

Charles: Or maybe just hot, kinky, passionate sex!
Pentrrekx: Will you SHUT UP?!?!

>             "This is an assault on a royal person! This is TREASON!"
>             "Even a princess of Jurai needs to be taken down a peg or
>two, occasionally."

Darrvon: And fanfic writers, too.
Charles: HEY! 
Darvon: ^_^
Charles: You know...you scare me like that.

> He flipped up my robes.

Charles: (Aeka) He fainted when he discovered I was really a man.
(The logs return yet again to fry Charles)
 
>             I hear screams starting. Ryoko is finding out that Tenchi
>has had enough.

Rraxus: (Tenchi) I KNEW that I shouldn't have eaten all those beans.
OTHERS: EEEEEEWWWWW!

> Heh. Apparently the field also prevents her
>teleportation.  
>            "Now. Do you know what this is?" Tenchi was holding out a
>long, thin, stick, with a curved handle. I didn't know the name, but I
>could guess what it was for.

Darrvon: Hockey.
Rraxus: Jai-Alai
Charles: It's a dildo for hot, kinky....(gets backhanded by Pentrrekx)...OW!

>             "You wouldn't!" 
>             "Oh, yes I would. And I will."
>             I counted twenty-four strokes before he let me go. And I
>felt every one of them.

Charles: That's what happens in sex.
Pentrrekx: What is this obsession you have with sex!
Charles: (Xelloss) THAT is a secret.
 
>             This is why I am sitting on the edge of the arm of the
>sofa.

Charles: 24 strokes isn't enough to satisfy anybody.
OTHERS: SHUT UP!!!

>             I have to say, though, he wasn't overly vicious. He just
>made me scream,

Darrvon: (Sarchastic) Gee...Is THAT all?
Rraxus: (Newscaster) Tenchi Masaki was arrested for the brutal assault
and battery of Aeka Jurai. Executions are expected to follow.
Charles: This is on Earth, Rraxus. They don't execute people for beating
other people.
Rraxus: And they consider themselves sentient?
 
>and I probably won't sit down properly for several days.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) If only Tenchi had learned to put down the toilet
seat...

>He did help me downstairs, afterwards. His father and grandfather are
>out, and he persuaded Washuu to look after Sasami. 

Darrvon: I don't know about you, but if she helped Tenchi in doing
that, as the author seems to be implying, I know I wouldn't want
her looking after anyone.

>             I can hear the whistling cracks and Ryoko's screams. I'm
>sure I didn't make that much noise.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) I'm sure that I made MUCH more!

>             I have to admit, it wasn't much fun, being... caned (if
>that's the right word) but the immediate prelude was surprisingly
>pleasurable. The anticipation...

ALL: (making fake coughing sounds) Bullshit...bullshit.

>             I wonder if he'll do it again?

Charles: Only if he REALLY wants to die a slow death.

>             "Hey, oneechan!"
>             Sasami has come back. I turn a a still watery smile to her.
>             "Oneechan... have you been crying? Why are you sitting
>funny?"

Rraxus: (Aeka) Because that idiot Tenchi left the toilet seat up and
I didn't notice it in time.

>             "Ask Ryoko, Imouto-chan. She will be along in a minute."
>Very true. the screams have stopped. Maybe she passed out?

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) After all, no one is in there to pry HER out of the
toilet.
 
>             No. Here comes Tenchi now, supporting a very upset Ryoko.
>             Tenchi looks directly at Washuu, who pales. Oho ho ho...

Charles: I imagine that the laugh is coming from Washu who knows that
she has the scientific genious to kick Tenchi's scrawny butt.

---End---

ALL: GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!

(The doors to the theatre open and the MSTers get ready to leave.

Charles: Well? What did you all think?
Rraxus: In this story Tenchi was an ass.
Darrvon: There's NO WAY that the other charactors in the story would
EVER take that sort of crap from anyone.
Pentrrekx: And this story, if you can call it that, belongs in the garbage.
Charles: Just wait. THIS was only a light warm up. There are lemon
fics to be MST'd.

_________________________________________________________

>From the author:  You know, I'm not surprised that the original writer
of this story didn't put his name or e-mail on it. I wouldn't want to admit
that I wrote something like this either. 

I hope that all of you reading this weren't TOO upset by the treatment
that I gave this story (I'd be more upset with the story itself). This IS
my first time trying to write an MST and I personally don't think that
it's up to the standards that the MSTers that I mentioned at the begining
set forth.
