Once again, I own no one.

MST#7
***********

(In the same dark and gloomy castle, sinister laughing can be heard.  
As you near, you can hear the rapid fire of a machine gun)
<JS> (hair sticking straight up, wild look in eyes, firing a gattling 
gun) HA! You cannot escape me!
*RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT!*
<JS> (stops firing) So what do you have to say for yourself?
<Shiro Ensen Amada> (from Gundam 08th MS Team) I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I 
DID!
<JS> WRONG ANSWER!  (begins firing)
<Shiro> AH!  OW!  EE!  GAH!
<JS> Oh yes!  I can feel it!  I CAN FEEL THE ADRENALINE! AH HA HA HA HA 
HA!
*RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT-A-TAT!*
<JS> THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR HURTING KIKI!  AH HA HA HA!  AH HA HA-OW!  
Knock it off!
<Asuka> (dragging JS by his ear) I have to watch you every SECOND, 
don't I?!
<JS> Ow!  Aw Asuka-chan!  Can't I have a little fun?!  Ow!  Leggo'!
(She drags him into the main room, with everybody around)
<Ranma> (to Asuka) So you caught Al Capone?
<JS> (sulking) Other MST captain gets to abuse characters they don't 
like, I don't get to do anything.
<Jim> Another fic from our mysterious taskmaster.guess who's the 
author.
<JS> Loreal "Mihoshi" Miller?
<Jim> .....How the hell did you know that?
<Ryoko> (tears streaming) Please tell me he didn't come out with 
Nobiyuki the Rapest yet.
<Jim> No, this one isn't it.  It's called, Kiyone's Best.
<JS> (sighs) I'll get the CPR kit.
<Ryoko> Let's move before the guns appear.

(Regular seating order)
<JS> (singing to himself) We're not gonna take it.
<Ryoko> (holds it up) I do.
<Ranma> Who wants to bet Ryoko and Ayeka are about to kill each other 
within the first couple paragraphs?
<Asuka> Me.  I think he has a little angst against those two.

>This Fanfic is not sutable for inmature people.

<JS> Oh, so now we're inmature.
<Vegetta> And the spiral just keeps going down.

> This fanfic contains sex and other content.

<Asuka> (looking in dictionary) Other.see crap.

> Please don't read this if you are not a mature person. Please read 
this fanfic and tell me >what you think.

<JS> (to Asuka) Please?
<Asuka> Fine.
<JS> (gives thumbs up) It stinks.

> I don't own any of the charactors in this fanfic. They belong to 
Pioneer and A.I.C. I >think.

<Ranma> He doesn't know who it belongs to, we are dead.

> (My notes and coming soon fanfics are at the bottom.) 

>Tenchi was outside working in the carrot patch along with Ryoohki. 
Tenchi picked up >the carrots with Ryoohki on his shoulder.

<JS> (to Ryoko) That isn't very sanitary is it?
<Ryoko> She's been shoulder-trained.

> As he got home Ryoko and Ayeka jumpped all over him. 

<Vegetta> Causing his back to snap like a twig, killing him, and saving 
us the horror of what is to come.

>"Oh Tenchi! I missed you so much." Ryoko said squeezing the life out 
of him.

>"I was just gone for 20min." Tenchi said hardly breathing.

<JS> Once again, no abbreviations on what the character is saying!

>"Oh lord Tenchi! It seems like forever to me." 

<Asuka> Not long enough for me.

>Ayeka said also holding onto Tenchi.

>"Hey Princess!. Tenchi belongs to me so back off!" Ryoko letting go of 
Tenchi. 

<JS> "Hey Loreal, this fic sucks already," Joe kicking him in the ass.

>Then Ayeka let go of Tenchi as he fell to the floor gasping for air.

>"Miss Ryoko! How dare you put a lable on Tenchi for yourself. 

<Ranma> I don't mean to get into spelling again, but how can you 
misspell label?

>Tenchi rightfuly belongs to me. He is a decendent of Jurai and he 
should rightfuly marry >me."

<Ryoko> I never did get that.  Just because he's related to her.
<Vegetta> Jurai, twenty-first century aliens living in a twelfth 
century human world. (Everyone snickers)

>Ayeka said.

>"Girls! Stop it! I don't like any of you.

(Ryoko stares in remote shock at the last line)

> More that the other." 

<Ryoko> (relieved) Oh, phew!
<Vegetta> (turns to camera) Yes folks, he did write it as two 
sentences.

>Tenchi said standing up.

>"I'll figure out who likes you the most Tenchi." 

<All> THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID!

>Ayeka and Ryoko said glaring at each other. They both marched outside. 

<Ranma> I thought they were already outside!
<JS> @_@ Spin.spin...spin.

>Tenchi not caring where they were going, went into the kitchen with 
the carrots. >Ryoohki followed him.

<Vegetta> (as Ryoohki) So, they do not suspect I am Ryo-Ohki's evil 
clone.ha ha ha.

>"Here's the carrots you asked for Sasami." Tenchi said.

>Suprisingly Sasami wasn't cooking. It was Kiyone!

<Asuka> If there is a God in Heaven, they will not use that as an 
accessory.

>"Hi Tenchi! Sasami is feeling under the weather so I'm making her some 
soup. 

<Ryoko> (as Kiyone) Would you like some tea?
<JS> (as Tenchi) No.
<Ryoko> Coffee?
<JS> No.
<Ryoko> Me?
<JS> Sure! (tries to grab Ryoko but she belts him in the head)
<Asuka> Sorry Happosai.

>Would you like anything?" Kiyone said with a smile on her face. Tenchi 
froze for a >minute and turned red. Then he shook himself from the 
trance.

<JS> (as Tenchi in a trance) Bountiful, breasts.must.have.

>"Ok! Um...It's almost dinnertime. Do you need any help?" Tenchi asked 
putting down >the carrots and giving one to Ryoohki as she ran out 
cherring with joy.

<JS> (smiles) How do you cherr with joy everyone?
<Others> With a lot of practice!

>"Tenchi. Can you take the soup up to Sasami?" Kiyone asked handing the 
bowl to him.

>"Ok!" Tenchi took the hot bowl of miso soup up to Sasami. Along with 
some hot tea. >Tenchi knocked on Sasami's door.

<Vegetta> (as demonic Sasami) Come innnnnn.

>"Come *cough* in." Sasami said. She sounded terrible.

>Tenchi walked into the door.

<Ranma> That had to hurt.
<JS> What, the grammar or the story?

> Sasami was so red. Tenchi grabed the thermometer on the dresser.

<Vegetta> (as Tenchi) Now bend over.
(Ryoko whacks him upside the head)

> Tenchi set the soup and the tea on the bedtray.

>"Sasami. Can you open your mouth?" Tenchi asked.  Sasami noded yes and 
opened her >mouth. He took Sasami's tempature was 110 degrees.

<All> What?!
<Asuka> She'd be dead.
<JS> If the if the run-ons don't kill her first.

>"Whoh! Sasami! Your burning up with fever."

<All> Fever?									          
<Vegetta> Try heat stroke.

> Tenchi said in shock. "Did you take some medicine?"

<Ryoko> (as sarcastic Sasami) No, I'm trying to kill myself, of course 
I took some medicine!

>Sasami knoded. "Kiyone said all I needed was some soup and tea and 
I'll feel a little >better."

<Ryoko> At a hundred and ten degree's, you should be at the hospital.
<JS> Yeah, there you'd just die from food poisoning.
<Asuka> That's real comforting.

> Sasami said with a cough after that.

>"Ok. I brought you some soup and some tea." he said putting the 
bedtray over her. >"After your finshed I'll bring somemore medicine."

<Ranma> (as Tenchi) And a dictionary.

>"Ok." Sasami said sitting up. She took the spoon and started to take 
slow sips.

<JS> (as sleezy Sasami) Remind you of anything Tenchi?
(Everyone hits him)

>Tenchi took an old bell off the dresser.

>"If you need anthing at all. Ryoko, Ayeka, Kiyone, Washu, Mihoshi, and 
I will come >and help you. Ok?" Tenchi said.

<All> Asked!

>Sasami nodded.

>Tenchi walked out of the room. Right in front of him was Kiyone. 
Almost close to >kissing her. He acedently scared her.

<JS> There should be no use of periods there!

> She stared to fall backwards and he grabbed her by her waist and 
pulled her up close to 
>him. She wrapped her arms around him. They both quickly released each 
other.

>"Um.....dinner is ready...

<Ranma> (as Kiyone) We're having fish.
<JS> (as Tenchi) I know, cause I can smell it already.
*KLONG!*

>Can you get Mihoshi and Washu while I get the timebombs in the yard?" 

<Vegetta> Kiyone was part of the Galaxy Police Bomb Squad?		          
<Ryoko> If she can't handle Mihoshi, then no.

>Kiyone said studering.

>"Uh....Ok. I'll go right now and get them." Tenchi said in the same 
fashion.

<Asuka> (as runway announcer) A beautiful sea green with sequins!  
Doesn't he look lovely?
(Ryoko wolf-whistles)

>They both went there sepetrate ways both in the shade of red.

<Asuka> (still announcer) Yes folks, it comes in a variety of color.

***********************************************

> Everyone was the the lunch table in seconds.

<All> Echo.echo.echo.

> Ryoko and Ayeka was both exsosted and couldn't move so Kiyone had to 
drag them to >the table. 

<JS> Normally, I wouldn't let that past, but this guy's IQ seems to be 
lower than Mihoshi's, so I'll accept it.somewhat.

>She looked pretty chared herself.

>"You two embrass this wholehouse hold." Kiyone said. 

<Ryoko> Do I want to know what embrass means?
<Vegetta> Probably not.

>She went over to her seat at the table until they heard a ring.

>"What's that noise?" asked Mihoshi.

>"It's Sasami's bell. Can you respond to it Mihoshi?" Tenchi said.

<JS> Oh.my.God.
<Asuka> That may be proper English, but nobody says "respond" anymore.
 
>"Ok! No problem Tenchi." Mihoshi said standing up. She acedentaly 
spilled the hot tea >on Kiyone.

<Ranma> When did they have tea?
<JS> When Loreal Kid's Styling Shampoo got a computer. (others stare at 
him nervously) What?

>"Ahhhhh! Mihoshi! I just washed this." Kiyone said grabbing a towel 
off the table.

<Ranma> And the towel.?
<Vegetta> Must have been next to the tea.

>"I'm sorry Kiyone! I didn't mean to." Mihoshi said standing up then 
bowing.

>"Just go help Sasami!" Kiyone said still trying to wipe the stain off 
her paints.

<Ryoko> Tea makes a stain?
<Vegetta> I thought tea was clear.
<JS> (sarcastic) Didn't you read?  She spilled tea on her PAINTS!  
Everyone knows those two never mix.
<Asuka> (hits her head) Duh.

>"Ok!" Mihoshi said. She rushed upstairs to suit Sasami's needs.

<Vegetta>...That was wrong.

>"Hello *cough 3x* Mihoshi." Sasami seemed a little better and a little 
worse.

<JS> Hello *finger 2x* Loreal.  No one can feel better and worseat the 
same time. 
<Vegetta> Unless you write the stupid comic. (others stare at him 
nervously)

>"Oh Sasami! You shouldn't speak. You need your rest." Mihoshi said 
with a little >worried expresstion on her face. 

<All> That hurts.

>She grabed a little pen from her pocket. It looked hi-tech. 

<All> (sarcastic shock) Wow!

>She pulled a little thin part out and a screen apeared. She gave it to 
Sasami and a little >pen to go with it.

<JS> A notebook and pencil would do.

>"Write what you need down on this piece of paper." Mihoshi said with a 
smile. Sasami >wrote it down and a voice came from the "Hi-Tech" pen. 

<Vegetta> (as voice) You are on a plate of Sashimi.

>Sasami said she was finshed and wanted her medicine.

>"Okay!" Mihoshi said with a happy face. Sasami started to smile. 
Mihoshi always >amuses her.

<All>...
<JS> (praying) Please don't take it any farther than that.

> Mihoshi took the medicine off the shelf and gave it to Sasami. Sasami 
wrote on the "hi->tech" paper: "Thank You Mom"

<All> "Thank you MOM?!"
<Asuka> Poor girl's delirious.
<Vegetta> Too much medicine.
<JS> (as high Sasami) Dude, this shit is the BOMB!	
*KLONG!*


>"Mom?" Mihoshi said with a counfused face. Mihoshi then got the idea 
and left the >room with the empty bowl of miso soup and left the tea 
there. 

<Ryoko> Could you tell us because we sure don't get it?
<Vegetta> Maybe he doesn't either.
<JS> Another failed attempt at a dramatic scene.

>She wasn't quite finshed so she left it. Then Sasami fell sound 
asleep.

>"All finshed!" Mihoshi said coming down the stairs.

>"What did she want?" Ayeka asked with a worried face.

>"She just wanted some medicine and she looks alot better." Mihoshi 
said.

>"That's a relief." Tenchi said.

>Later that  night everyone went to bed except Kiyone and Tenchi. 

<All> (sarcastic) Of course.

>Tenchi was doing some homework and Kiyone was watching "A Promuse to 
Caraline". 

<Vegetta> (confused) A what to who?
<JS> This is why I try to avoid writing movie titles in my fics.

>A very sad movie indeed.

<Asuka> If it's in your story, it probably is.

> As she was watching the movie, Tenchi was finshed with his homework. 
He went to >peak on Kiyone. She was streching and clicked off the TV.

<JS> (smiles) How do you click off a.
<Ranma> Alright, that's getting annoying.

> She turned around and saw Tenchi coming downstairs.

<All except JS> (to JS) No.
(He snaps his fingers)

>"Hello Tenchi. You still up?" Kiyone asked.

>"Yep! I got a big test tommorow and I have to study." Tenchi said.

>Kiyone was so tired she couldn't stand up right. 

<Ryoko> And yet she's going to have enough energy to screw Tenchi's 
brains out.
<Vegetta> (pats her on back) Now, now.  Just because you can't do it.
<Ryoko> (being held back by JS) I'M GOING TO STRANGLE YOU!

>She found out how hard Sasami's work can be. She started to climb the 
stairs and started >to fall backwards once again. 

<Ranma> When did she fall backwards the first time?
<JS> I think we can assume she did when she couldn't stand up right.

>Tenchi caught her by the waist and pulled her close again. She put her 
around him and >they kissed this time but on acedent. It lasted for 
about 10 seconds.

<Asuka> If I kissed someone on ACCIDENT, I would be off of them in a 
flash.
<JS> (smiles) You want to find out?
*KLONG!*
<JS> (in pain) Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

> It seemed like they were both enjoying it. They then broke lose and 
Kiyone was red. >Tenchi was also the shade of red. They were still 
holding each other. Then they began to 
>kiss again. Tenchi started to walk backwards with Kiyone walking 
forward. 

<Vegetta> Weren't they on the steps?
 <Ranma> Don't know, don't care.
 <JS> Anyone else thinking of the tango?

>They both steped into Tenchi's room and closed the door.

>They both plopped on the bed. Kiyone was at the bottom. Tenchi was at 
the top. They >still countiued to kiss. Then Tenchi started to put his 
hand up Kiyone's shirt. 

<JS> (as Tenchi) Here comes the monkey looking for some bananas. 
(others stare at him REAL nervously, he turns red and sinks out of 
view)

>Kiyone helped him take it off. There, was her blue cotton bra.

<JS> Marvel at her bra!
 <Others> (sarcastic shock) Ooooooooooooooo.

> He started to undo it and he finnaly got it off. There was her large 
sized breast. 

<JS> (smiles) I don't think I need to tell you to marvel at those.
 (Asuka and Ryoko hit him)

>Tenchi started to rub them to get them untinse.

<All> Untinse......
 <Vegetta> Anything?
 <Ranma> I got nothing.

> Kiyone started to moan as Tenchi massaged her breast nice and hard. 
Then Tenchi >stopped and took Kiyone's paints off.

<Ryoko> How many times is he going to repaint our house?
 <JS> Or forget tell us how they spilled it on themselves?

> Then he took off her panties. Tenchi then started to take his finger 
and massaged her >cuilt.

<All>....
<Asuka> I REALLY do not like this guy.

> She began to moan a little louder but Tenchi shushed her. Tenchi 
began to move it >around and around but a little faster this time. 

<JS> Where it comes out, nobody know! (others stare nervously at him)

>Kiyone began to moan again but not very loud this time. Tenchi sat up 
and took his >shirt, pants and underware. 

<Ryoko> Where'd he take them?
 (Vegetta does a rimshot)

>Kiyone was supised to see they were covered in carrots. 

<All>......
<Vegetta> That isn't funny.

>She started to smile. She sat up and went to his cock and started to 
suck it. Tenchi began >to moan rubbed Kiyone's head with his hand 
stering it in circles.

<Asuka> (as Kiyone) Stop!  I'm getting dizzy!
 <JS> If she's sucking Tenchi's cock, she must be.
 (Ryoko blasts him)

> Her hair was starting to friz up. Tenchi then sat Kiyone up and 
turned her around. >Kiyone then whispered in Tenchi's ear. 

<JS> Don't tell me the things I want to hear.

>Tenchi sighed and went to his underware draw and pulled out a condom. 

<All>.......
<Vegetta> I can't believe he would keep one in his drawer.
 <JS> (reaches in pocket) Yeah, everyone knows you're supposed to have 
it in your wallet.
 *KLONG!*

>He put it on and then turned her around. He stuck his cock into 
Kiyone. Then he began >to fuck her.

<Ranma> He.he's using undescriptive dialouge.he.he's.
<Others> (low) Tank Cop.

>Kiyone have out soft huffs and puffs.

<Ryoko> But the house would not blow down.

>She also began to moan. Tenchi was rubbing her breast and pinching her 
nipples. 

<Girls> Ow.

>Kiyone was so relaxed. She started to let out soft screms along with 
her huffs and puffs. 

<JS> The big, bad, wolf having orgasms.
 *KLONG KLONG KLONG!*
 *BLAM BLAM BLAM!*

>That went on for 7 minutes. 

<Asuka> Not a big surprise.
 <Guys> Hey!

>Then Tenchi stopped and Kiyone turned around and kissed him. Kiyone 
returned down >to her original postion at his cock and Tenchi cummed 
her.

<JS> (as Brooklyn gangster) Yeah, I'm gonna cum ya, see?  Yeah.
*KLONG!*

>Tenchi now began to moan as she started to suck it. That went on for 5 
minutes. 

<Girls> No big surprise.
<Guys> Shut up!

>They both started to get tired. 

<Girls> They both?!
<JS> (gets right in Asuka's face) You want me to show you five nights 
you'll never forget?
*KLONG KLONG KLONG!*

>They both layed down on Tenchi's bed and Tenchi was kissing Kiyone and 
they both >looked at each other.

>"What did we just do Tenchi?"

<All>.....
<Ryoko> Anyway, (as Tenchi) I think we just played baseball.
<JS> No plot, no charcterization, yep.it sucks.

> Kiyone asked out of breath

>"I don't know. I'm not sure If I wanted to." 

<Ranma> The characters don't even know what the hell they're doing, I'm 
getting out of here. (walks up to doorway but stopped by the guns, he 
slinks back to his seat)

>Tenchi said with a worried face plus tired.

<Ryoko> Minus intelligence.

>"Did we just do it? 

<JS> (as Tenchi> Do what?
<Vegetta> (as Kiyone) It!
<Asuka> (covers JS's mouth) None of that now.

>I mean what will the others think?" Kiyone said also tired and out of 
breath.

>"They won't know. We can't tell this to anyone because we don't know 
why we did it." >Tenchi said.

<Vegetta> They don't know, we don't know, the author probably doesn't 
know, hell, let's just have a big idiot party!
<Ryoko> Calm down Vegetta.

>"Yeah. Plus, if Ayeka and Ryoko knew...well you know." Kiyone said 
with a smile. >"Let's keep this little get together our little secret."

>"I'm way..ahead of....you." Tenchi said then he and Kiyone fell 
asleep.




>TO BE CONTINUED

<All> BOOOOOOOOOO! (start throwing junk at the screen)

>How did yo like my little story. There's a second chapter and I'm 
working on it.

<All> NO!

> Please...If you have any qustions or coments please tell me. e-mail 
at >mihoshi_spacegirl@yahoo.com OR kiyonie_spacegirl@sailormoon.com

<Vegetta> Who the hell would name their e-mail account that anyway? 
<Asuka> What kind of account is Whazzup316@cs.com?
<JS> I just so happens I was into WWF then, I really liked the Dudley 
Boyz, and Stone Cold Steve Austin.
<Asuka> Not that, I mean the compuserve sign up.  Why the hell did you 
sign up for it?
<JS> (blushes) One of the more stupider things I've done.

there.
<Others>...

>And a little more. My specialty is lemons and crossovers.

(Vegetta pulls out a gong and hits hit)

<Vegetta> Numbskull can't even spell his own name right.
<Jim> Guns are offline, you can leave now.
<JS> Hey, I still left Shiro in the cage.
<Asuka> Better go let him out, he only has one leg.
<All except her and JS>...
<Ryoko> You blew off his leg?!
<JS> No!  Of course not!  I pulled him out after the series ended, damn 
bastard leaving us to hang like that.  I still know nothing about KIKI!
<Vegetta> So you were shooting at him while he only had one leg?
<JS> Yeah, you know how funny it is trying to see him run?
<Others>....
<Ranma> You're a sick.sick man.

*************

If you haven't noticed, I don't like this Loreal guy, but I'm glad he's 
not turning this into Sammy's Little Secret.  Say, my next MST will be 
in the Ah! My Goddess section of fanfiction.net.  I'm going after the 
Assassin again.
