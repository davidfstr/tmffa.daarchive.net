No money is passing hands here, no need to sue  Just another MST done in fun.

The Millennium Eagle zipped past at transwarp four.  Jim Ohki had yet to decide 
on just where they were going, so he just kept changing vectors.  Command wasn't 
saying anything about him going from here to there.  Nothing exciting was going 
on.

Jim was down in ten forward, enjoying the view.  As well as talking to the MST 
crew.  After an hour, Jim decided that it was time.

Jim: "Alrighty then MSTers, back to work.  There is a never ending supply of 
crap."

MSTers:
Jim Ohki: The Captain, has Chi-Chi and Mihoshi waiting for him in his quarters.
Tenchi and Ayeka Masaki: The prince and the princess, has their son Jim waiting 
in Jim's quarters.  (Mihoshi needed practice raising kids.)
Ash and Misty Ketchum: The PokeMon master and the redhead, are getting tired of 
hearing about kids.

>Tenchi Go Boom Part 2: Ayeka Go Boom

Ash: "Was this written by a kid?"
Misty: "Probably.  Either that or she couldn't come up with a good title."

>This continues from when Ayeka found out that Tenchi and Ryoko were doing
>something upstairs and went to see it for herself. Ryoko is lying in her bed
>still nude and a bit mussed up.

Jim: "Alrighty then.  Tenchi?"
Tenchi: "This is so NOT my sex life."
Ayeka: "No kidding.  I know that Ryoko doesn't let you out of her sight after . 
. . hubba-hubba."

>Ayeka: You. You tramp. You harlot. You...you...you...you...(looking out the
>door to make sure Sasami is out of earshot) BITCH!!!
>Ryoko: hmm...huh? Oh, what were you saying? I was busy lying on these
>cumstained sheets thinking about riding Tenchi's big hard cock, but anyway
>continue.

Jim: "THRILL, AS THE LACK OF DETAILS LEADS YOU INTO THE WALL!"
Ash: "This is different.  Somebody is taking a new approach to writing."
Misty: "Or is extremely bored."

>Ayeka: I know what's been going on up here. Washu found a pubic hair in
>Tenchi's teeth. We all know everything. How could you do such a thing
>without thinking about how I would feel.

All: "EEEEEWWWWWWWWW!"

>Ryoko: Jealous are we? (plucking out a pubic hair) Here, you can have one
>too.

Girls: "What, doesn't she have any pain receptors?"
Guys: "OOOOUUUUUUCCCCCCCHHHHH!"

>Ayeka: Waaah! I can't take it anymore!! I never thought I'd have to take it
>this far but it seems I must
>Ayeka and Ryoko continue fighting. Meanwhile downstairs.
>Kiyone: Geez, I wonder what's going on up there.
>Washu: You know very well what's goin on up there.
>Kiyone: I hope it's nothing like what was going on a few minutes ago.
>Washu: Trust me on this Kiyone. With those two it can be one of three
>things,an argument a fight or a war.
>Everyone: A war.

Tenchi: "Boy and how do people NOT have any faith in these two."
Ayeka: "No kidding.  We GET along now.  You know, NOT FIGHT and all."

>Tenchi: I'd better go see what's going on up there.
>Washu: I don't think you should.
>Tenchi: Come on, Washu. What's the worst that could happen?
>Washu: Suit yourself but don't come back to haunt me when you're killed by
>flying debris.
>Tenchi: (muttering) If they are fighting up there, I hope Ryoko isn't
>clothed yet.

Tenchi: "Hmmm . . . that gives me an idea."
Ayeka: "What kind of idea?"
Jim: "Not now.  People will mutate your ideas into . . . (pulls out several 
fics) . . . these."

>Washu: Whatd'ya say?
>Tenchi: Um, I said uh Yep it's an all out war I'll bet.
>Mihoshi: Oh really? I thought you said you hoped Ryoko wasn't clothed
>ye....Hey....hrmph..mmph..mmnnph.
>Noboyuki: My son. My son has finally become a man. And I was right there to
>see it sort of. I just hope he doesn't become a maniacal pervert like...
>Washu: Like you?

Somewhere a rimshot is heard.

>Noboyuki: Not me. I meant um, uh...Mihoshi! Yeah Mihoshi!
>Washu: MI-WHO-SHI?!
>Mihoshi: Don't try that with me. I found your porn collection. Interesting
>stuff really. But what's a maniacal?

All: -_- . . . o_o . . . O_O . . . @_@'.

>Noboyuki: You guys didn't believe me for a second did you?
>Tenchi walked in to the room to find Ayeka and Ryoko still at each other's
>throats. As he had hoped,Ryoko hadn't put her clothes back on yet.

Tenchi: "WHOA RYOKO!  Get some sun on those cheeks!"

>Ayeka: TEN-chiiiII?
>Tenchi: What? What are you staring at?
>Ryoko:(giggling)  Well if you look down you will see that a
>rather...large...tent has formed in your pants.

Ash: "The circus is in his pants?"
Misty: "Quiet you."
Ayeka: "You better believe there's a circus in those pants."

>Ayeka: My, that is a big one. But as I was saying, TENCHI I HAVE HAD IT NOW
>I AM GONNA FUCK YOU IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO! NOW YO HAVE TWO CHOICES.
>EITHER I HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH A BLUNT OBJECT AND RAPE YOU OR I HAVE A
>THREESOME WITH YOU AND RY..o..ko. me and my big mouth.

Ayeka: "So what?  Threesome are fun.  Right Jim?"
Jim: "Oh yeah.  Be dishing out the pie and Strudel, then get to sit back and 
wait for the females to make Rhubarb."
Ash: "Misty doesn't like Strudel."

>Ryoko: Well between a potentially fatal blow to the head and a threesome I
>guess you have no choice.
>Tenchi: Threesome's fine.

Tenchi: "Yes they are.  Talk about exercise . . . WHOO!"
Jim: "Speaking of which . . ." (leaves theatre for his quarters.)

>Ryoko: Well it's better than being bludgeoned to death, I suppose.
>After the undressing or in some cases reundressing and about an hour of
>steamy foreplay....

Tenchi: "Re-undressing?  What the hell is that all about?"
Ash: "Nakedism man.  You have your own nudist colony in your room."
Ayeka: "'Nudist colony' is about half of it."

>Tenchi: Well, is now alright?
>Ayeka: No, I'm not ready yet.
>Tenchi: OK A little extra foreplay never hurt anybody.

Tenchi: "You won't really get an argument out of me."
Misty: "Ash doesn't know the meaning of foreplay."
Ayeka: "Ash, go take lessons from Jim."
Ash leaves the theatre.
Chi-Chi walks in.

>An hour later...
>Tenchi: What about now?
>Ayeka: Not yet!
>Tenchi: We either start now or I'll use blue dental floss in front of you
>for the rest of my life!!

Chi-Chi: "The mint flavored floss?"
Tenchi: "I don't think that's what the author meant."

>Ayeka: You wouldn't!
>Ryoko: Oh, he would. That's how this whole thing got started. Only it was
>..."natural floss".
>Ayeka: Just a little more time.
>Ryoko: What are your legs closed for the night?

Ayeka: "I am NOT a convenience store!"
Tenchi: "And you don't have bankers hours, either."

>Ayeka: No, I want to savor my moment with Tenchi without being penetrated by
>a large thrusting cock!!

Jim (from his quarters): "Alright Ash, you can watch.  But ONLY because she said 
you could."
Ayeka: "But that's the goal.  To get penetrated by Tenchi's shlong."
Tenchi: "You've been hanging around Jim too much."
Chi-Chi: "At least she didn't call it a shrimp."

>Ryoko:Open sesame! (pinching Ayeka on the ass)
>Ayeka:Giggle!
>Ryoko: Stick your fork in her, she's done.

Misty: "You've got a multi-pronged dick?"
Tenchi: "That would be interesting, actually."

>Ayeka: I am not! And you're beginning to sound like the writer of this
>fanfic to which none of us charachters belong! Please Don't sue her.

Ayeka: "Ah, there's the disclaimer.  What a way to write it in."
Ash (from Jim's quarters): "Mihoshi has a MUCH better rack that Misty.  Can I?"
Mihoshi (from the quarters): "Sure, have fun."

>Tenchi: Floss.
>Ayeka: OK but start already! I don't have all night!
>Ryoko: She wastes two hours saying she isn't ready yet and now she doesn't
>have all night?
>Ayeka: Hey! That wasn't..WHOOAA, that IS a big one!
>So Tenchi started fucking her from behind when...

Ayeka: "Alrighty then.  I make SOME noise, don't I?"
Tenchi: "Some?  How many windows have you cracked?"

>Tenchi: Ayeka, this is a threesome, remember eat or I stop.
>Ayeka: But...
>Tenchi: Floss! (thinking) I should have taken the blow to the head. At least
>I'd be unconsious. And if I did die, who wants to screw a corpse? Oops.
>Forgot Ayeka wants to screw me dead OR alive.
>Ayeka: Oh, Alright. Bon apetit.
>Ayeka surprisingly put her tounge exactly where she was supposed to put it.
>At the same time, her fuses were about to blow.
>Ryoko: You know, you're good. Have you been practicing on Sasami?

All: "HELL NO!"

>Ayeka: OH YES!

All: "HELL NO!"

>Ryoko: Huh?
>Ayeka: I'm gonna cum you idiot!!
>As she came however something strange happened. She started singing on time
>with Tenchi's thrusts.

Chi-Chi: "Who in the world sings during their orgasm?"
Tenchi: "Ayeka doesn't . . . she screams."
Jim (from his quarters): "Ash, you have to do better than that.  Watch and 
learn.  AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PUT THAT THING AWAY!"

>Ayeka: I've got a wobbly bunch of crocus butts and there they are a stamping
>in the crow!
>Tenchi came to a sudden stop.
>Tenchi: I can't do you,Ayeka.
>Ayeka: And why the hell not?
>Tenchi: You're weird.

Ayeka: "Oh, I get it.  An author that doesn't like me."
Chi-Chi: "And the understatement of the year award goes to . . . (drumroll) . . 
. AYEKA!"

>She suddenly got up and skipped toward the door still spurting cum all over
>the place.

All: "WHAT THE HELL?!"
Tenchi: "Since when can you do that?"
Jim (from his quarters): "And this is Mihoshi in her Pfil costume."

>Coincidently Washu came up to see what was going on.
>Washu: Oh Geez, not again! What's that in your teeth, Ayeka? (plucking it
>out) GAAAAAK!!!! ANOTHER FRIGGIN PUBIC HAIR? DON'T YOU PEOPLE EVER STOP TO
>REST?

Tenchi (sarcastically): "No.  We do not need sleep."
Ayeka: "We are androids, and we do not require recharging."
Chi-Chi: "You ain't no android."

>Ayeka: Well if you put it that way Tenchi, I hope you hear this well. I
>CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!! I'M GAY! I'M GAY! I'M GAY!!! And Miss Washu is my
>new lover!
>Washu: Hey, I've been known to light a candle at both ends but I'm afraid
>you're too weird for me.
>Ayeka: Huh?
>Washu: I heard you from downstairs. By the way nice hooters, Ryoko.
>Ayeka: Here, I believe this pubic hair belongs to you. (running down the
>stairs still naked) MIHOSHI! Hows about me and you take a walk say... to
>that abandoned cave?
>Ryoko: You know, Tenchi. You've got guts. If Ayeka tried to do that to me
>willingly I'd be completely grossed out.
>Tenchi: gros...gross...OH CRAP! THE GROCERIES!!! I forgot again. Blast my
>erections!

Misty: "Sure.  Blame NOT getting anything done on erections.  That just means 
that no-one is allowed to be horny again."
All (even the people in Jim's quarters): "AH CRAP!"

>Washu: At this rate, by the time the groceries get here we'll be so starved
>we'll all have your pubic hair in our teeth.

>                                                    END
>Stay tuned for Tenchi Go Boom Part 3 : Ayeka Interrupted

Jim (walking back into the theatre): "Alrighty folks, what did ya think?"
Tenchi: "Well, for one thing, my sex life is better than that.  And for cryin' 
out loud, DAD gets the groceries."
Ayeka: "I most certainly am NOT A LESBIAN!  Bisexual is more like it."
Ash (poking his head in the door): "Foreplay is cool . . ."
Misty: "I can see that Ryoko and Ayeka are bisexual.  How else are they going to 
get any time with Tenchi?"
Chi-Chi: "Well, he did MARRY both of them."
Jim: "Dismissed."

The MSTers leave the theatre, with Ash, Misty and Chi-Chi staying behind in the 
hallway.  Jim sees them loafing around, and wanders over toward them.

Ash: "What do you think Misty?"
Misty: "I'd like to try it . . . but he has to approve."
Jim (scaring Ash): "Approve what, Misty?"
Chi-Chi: "Mihoshi needs to have a say in it as well."
Tenchi and Ayeka walk past with their son, meaning Mihoshi is now alone.
Jim: "Alrighty then, let's go have a conversation with Mihoshi."

And with that, they headed into Jim's quarters.  As they had their talk, the 
Millennium Eagle continued to zip about the galaxy . . .
