Ryoko's Idea
Bye Android1821 xanthun@hotmail.com

<Isamu> bye, who?
<Kusanagi> wow what excellent spelling!
<Isamu> guess the grammar check is broke....
<Kusanagi> yep

It was another day at the Masaki Shrine in Okayama. Tenchi had just gotten
up, used the bathroom, gotten dressed and gone downstairs. During the
delicious breakfast of Miso Soup made by the master chef, Sasami, Tenchi
noticed that Ryoko was looking at him strangely.

<Kusanagi> (as ryoko) mmmm what he would look like in a speedo....
<Isamu>  mmmhmmmm.........let's get on with it.....

During Tenchi&#8217;s chores out in the carrot fields, Tenchi noticed a Ryoko
watching him from a rock.

<Isamu> (as tenchi) I hate it when those damn ryokos look at me from a rock
<Kusanagi> There's more than one?
<Isamu> *shrug* I dunno...he said a ryoko...

 He was used to this, but today there was something
strange about her look.

<Isamu> (as Tenchi) Oh lose I contact I see!
<Kusanagi> Oh as if she doesn't stare at him like that all the time..

 It was almost as if she was&#8230; if she was planning
something&#8230; Tenchi noticed the same thing throughout the rest of the day.

<Kusanagi> *sarcastically* he was wearing no pants!

That night, when Tenchi entered his room to go to bed, he found Ryoko poking
around.

<Kusanagi> bet she planted some edible underwear in his room
<Isamu> riiiigggggghhhhht

 &#8220;Ryoko, what are you doing in my room?&#8221; asked Tenchi,

<Kusanagi> (as Ryoko in a Fat Bastard voice) looking for hot raw sex!

 a little
annoyed. "Oh Tenchi, I..." said Ryoko. "Oh never mind", said Tenchi.

<Isamu> (as Tenchi)I know.......you're looking for the snack foods again aren't you!?
<Kusanagi>  What snack foods, some sausage perhaps?

 "Just get out of my room so I can get to bed!" 

<Kusanagi> Yet again Tenchi avoids getting laid
<Isamu> Ah still see he hasn't grown some balls yet.

Ryoko hesitated for a second, then with a little more urges from Tenchi, she reluctantly left.

<Isamu> You know she'll be back
<Kusanagi> Oh yeah 

Later that night, while everyone was asleep, Ryoko snuck out her room.

<BOTH> Gee we couldn't see that one coming.....

 She went down the hall passed Ayeka's room and heard her talking in her sleep.
"Ooh Tenchi. I'm so glad we are finally getting married." She muttered.

<Kusanagi> Like she'd be thinking about the marriage, she'd be thinking about the honey moon,
suprisingly ryoko didn't hear moaning
<Isamu> So that's what that whip is for.....

"Feh! In her dreams!" Ryoko said ironically.

<Isamu> Not sure you'd really like to know about some of those dreams....

 She continued on down the hall, but not until she put Ayeka's hand in some hot water.

<Kusanagi> mmm Ayeka wet herself twice
*Isamu scoots two seats over*
<Kusanagi> What?

When Ryoko got to Tenchi's room, she silently went through the door,
(literally,) and flew over to Tenchi's Bed.

<Isamu> (as Ryoko) OOO How soft and springy it is!!

 She slowly put her hand under his blanket.

<Kusanagi> (as ryoko) now where's that sausage?

 "Damn! Not the right conditions!"

<Isamu> Must be raining outside....
<Kusanagi> Yeah Tenchi doesn't have his raincoat

 she said a little loudly so Tenchi woke up.

<Kusanagi> (as a groggy Tenchi) Who wants to play tug-of-war this early?

 When asked what she was doing in Tenchi's room again, she had to come up with a lame excuse.

<Kusanagi> (as Ryoko) Would you believe ..ah.... trying to find hand lotion?

"Oh Tenchi! You were tossing and turning and making weird sounds!

<Kusanagi> (as Tenchi) I was having the best dream in the world!
<Isamu> yeah a wet one probably

 I was worried about you!"

<Kusanagi> phbbt...she just wanted some early morning wood
<Isamu> Ah she's now a logger I see...

 Then she was shooed out of his room.

<Kusanagi> What the hell kind of guy shoos a girl out of his room?
<Isamu> You're lookin at him....
<Kusanagi> Ah ......a guy that is not hungry for a little pie

 The next morning, Tenchi could tell that Ryoko was trying not to make eye
contact with Tenchi. "I wonder what she is up too?" thought Tenchi to
himself.

<Isamu> Oh perhaps thinking of same way to get into his pants again....
<Kusanagi> No I think she's calculating the earth's atmospheric pressure if the moon were to
 shift three degrees vertically
*Isamu pulls out a big wrench and hits Kusanagi over the head*  *THUNK*
*Kusanagi hits popcorn and soda encrusted floor* 
<Kusanagi> AWWW, What the hell was that for?
*Isamu continues watching*

 It turned out that Ayeka had pissed her bed last night

<Kusanagi> (recovering) and how old is Ayeka again?

 and Ryoko, her bad mood totally gone, found something new to add to her ever growing
list of things to tease Ayeka about.

<Kusanagi> (as Ryoko) HAHA! you have purple hair!......and you wet your bed!

With Ryoko following Ayeka around for the rest of the day Tenchi was pretty much left alone.

<Isamu> Tenchi alone, a little out of character there
<Kusanagi> And you expected something normal in a lemon?
<Isamu>  Oh yeeeaaaaaaah.........

 Until that night.
Since Mihoshi and Kiyone had volunteered to do 

<Kusanagi> TENCHI THE RIGHT WAY!

Tenchi's chores for him that
day,

<Kusanagi> (disappointed) awww.....
 Tenchi wasnt very tired that night. But because of the sake that he
drank secretly that night he fell right asleep.

<Kusanagi> Isn't he a little young for the drinks?
<Isamu> This is Japan moron! 
<Kusanagi> *waits a moment* *Slaps Isamu*  SLAP!
<Isamu> tha hell?
<Kusanagi> Don't talk!

Again, when everyone was asleep, Ryoko snuck into Tenchi's room.

<BOTH> WHO COULDN'T SEE THAT COMING? AGAIN!

 She put her hand under Tenchi's blanket.

<Kusanagi> Can you say "Deja Vu"?
<Isamu> But she's going for the nuts probably
*Mr. Peanut runs by*
<Mr. Peanut> *singing* Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you.....
*Isamu pulls out a gun and shoots Mr. Peanut right between the eyes*
<Isamu> Peanut butter anyone?
<Kusanagi> AH.................no, I think not.

 "Yes!" she thought to herself. Last night, Tenchi had had boxers on while he was sleeping.

<Isamu> <as T.V. in the corner> And they get ready for Round 1!
<Kusanagi> That was a horrible joke.
<Isamu> .............yes, I know.

 But since he had fallen asleep drunk that night, he forgot to put his sleeping clothes on.

<Kusanagi> So what'd he have, regular clothes on?

 Ryoko grabbed Tenchi's cock and started playing with it to get it hard enough.

<Kusanagi> *acting as ring announcer* Ladies and Gentlemen you've heard of cock fighting, this
is cock playing!

When it was, she wrapped her hand around it and started to stroke it.

<Kusanagi> *as a commercial* How many strokes to the center of a Tenchi cock?"
<Isamu> Hopefully the world will never know.

 That night, Tenchi had dreams full of pleasure. He woke up with a sticky cock.

<Kusanagi> Damn, hate it when that happens
<Isamu> (as tenchi) Now where were those paper towels.....

The next day at breakfast, Mihoshi spilled a bottle of Sake all over the
table.

<Kusanagi> (as Mihoshi) I knew those towels were here earlier....

 Because no one had gotten a good sleep last night because of some
weird moans coming from Tenchi's room, no one bothered to clean it up.

<Isamu> Tenchi or the table?

 They just picked up their breakfast and went outside to the deck to eat.
When they were all settled outside, Ryoko went over to Tenchi. She hung

<Kusanagi> Shouldn't Tenchi be the one that's hung?

 on his shoulders and said, "C'mon Tenchi! Let's go sit in our own private tree
and eat!" she said. "Fat chance you monster!" Said Ayeka. "Tenchi has
promised to sit with me in our own private tree!" 

<Isamu> (as Tenchi) Now there's enough of me to go around no need for fighting...
<Kusanagi> What's with these private trees anyways...
<Isamu> *shrugs* Hell if I know...

You can go sit with a baboon Miss Priss!" said Ryoko. "What did you call me?" said Ayeka.

<Kusanagi> Is it me, or does Ayeka have bad hearing?
<Isamu> perhaps Tenchi could suggest a miracle ear and all these fights would end because Ayeka 
would actually here something for once....

"It's what I always call you Princess Prissy Pants! replied Ryoko.

<Isamu> Doesn't she mean pissy pants? She was only making fun of her for it earlier...
<Kusanagi> I think so...

 Then the whole deck exploded with fireballs and energy blasts. "Oh well." Said Tenchi.

<Kusanagi> Not exactly what I would say if _my_ deck was being destroyed... but then it's Tenchi
<Isamu> and when would logic play a part here?
<Kusanagi> *sarcastically* what's logic?
<Isamu> yeeeeeaaaaaah....

 "At least we don't have to rebuild the inside of the house again!"

<Kusanagi> and again, and again, and again.....for all of time!

That night, Ryoko decided to take it to the next level.

<Isamu> *as elevator operator* Going Up!

 She snuck into Tenchi's room and slowly pulled the blanket up off his lower half. She
slowly started to suck and lick Tenchi's Cock as it got harder. Again strange sounds came 
from Tenchi's room. 

<Isamu> Sounds like a hardware store up there with so much screwing going on!

The next day, Tenchi couldn't help feeling like he had had a strange dream
that Ryoko had performed oral sex on him last night.

<Kusanagi> How could he have that idea
<Isamu> Maybe the fact that wang had come around.... and it was a little messy
<Kusanagi> Good job Scooby! You found a clue!

 When he shared this to the family at breakfast,

<Kusanagi> HOLD ON NOW! What kind of teenage boy shares this information at breakfast?
<Isamu> maybe one of those Japanese customs we don't know about...Share your sex dream at 
breakfast!
<Kusanagi> And I thought I was weird
<Isamu> ...... you are.....

 Ryoko blushed and went through the wall.

<Kusanagi> Sure wasn't that shade last night.....

 She called Ryo-Ohki and they went to a Kareoke Bar. Ryo-Ohki got a plate of carrots
dozed in sake.

<Isamu> I didn't know carrots could sleep....

 Ryoko was having a drinking contest with a gruff old man. Ryo-Ohki, who had gotten drunk 
from the carrots,

<Kusanagi> Must be a low intolerance to carrots...

 got up on stage and started meowing into the microphone. "Meow, Meow"

*at that second the Orkin man came and stepped and squashed ryo-ohki
<Orkin Man> Darn cabbits....give them a couple of carrots and they start to take over the place
 
she sang in a drunken manner.
On their way home, the two girls ran into Sakuya. "Oh hi Ryoko!" said
Sakuya. "Yah sure whatever." Ryoko replied gruffly.

*Ryoko thought in her mind* *singing* I gave Tenchi head, I gave Tenchi head!

 "Oh and hello Ryo-Ohki!"
said Sakuya. At that moment, Ryo-Ohki turned rabid and attacked Sakuya.

<Isamu> *FOX commercial guy* Tonight at 7, When Cabbits Attack!

 Then Ryoko stuffed Sakuya in a trashcan  and went on there way.
They got home around 8 PM and were scolded by Sasami for missing dinner.

<Isamu> And the FOX special too.....

Ryoko wasn't quite so sober she went to bed to plan tonight's trip to
Tenchi's room.

<Kusanagi> Wow so much planning. Go to Tenchi's room, give head, go back to sleep

 Later that night at around 2:30 AM, Ryoko silently went to Tenchi's room. She lifted the 
blanket off his lower half again, and took her own pants off. She very carefully floated on 
top of Tenchi and stuck his cock that was already hard from a nice dream he was having. 
Ryoko slowly lowered herself upon, sliding his cock into her pussy.

<Kusanagi> (as Ryoko thinking) Let's play "Hide the Sausage!"
 
It was at that moment that Tenchi woke up. "Huh? What are you doing..? Ryoko?"

<Kusanagi> What does it look like she's doing you idiot, she's riding you like a bronco!
<Isamu> And we thought Tenchi was smart....
<Kusanagi>  Lemon, remember?
<Isamu> Oh Yeah...

 Tenchi didn't have to look twice to see what she was doing.

<BOTH> DER!

 He smiled his little half smile and said "Ryoko! What are you doing?"

<Isamu> I guess it isn't really obvious what's going on....

"Oh Tenchi! I just couldn't hold back any longer! I had to have sex with you! I just had to!"

<Kusanagi> Isn't that rape?
<Isamu> can you rape the willing?
<Kusanagi> Guess not...

 cried Ryoko. "Oh Ryoko! All you had to do was ask! I
would have done it with you anyways! You didn't have to do it while I was
sleeping!" Tenchi paused for a second and thought about how weird that had
sounded. "Oh Tenchi! Give it to me then!"
Tenchi laid Ryoko down and started unbuttoning her dress.

<Kusanagi> I thought she was wearing pants....
<Isamu> Logic.......logic.....

 When it was off, he lowered his hand down and stuck two fingers up her moist pussy.

<Kusanagi> mmmm like KFC, finger lickin' good

 He started to move them around and Ryoko let out a slight moan and a sigh.

<Isamu> Oh no, not the "weird noises" again....

Tenchi withdrew his fingers and lowered his head down between her legs. He
stuck his tongue up her pussy and started to move it around. Ryoko moaned so
loudly, that it could have awakened the whole house. But it didn't because
of the special soundproof mechanisms that Washu had installed in the rooms
because she suspected what might be the cause of those sounds.

<Kusanagi> WAIT A SECOND.....I thought earlier that everybody couldn't get any sleep
 because of the "weird noises?"
<Isamu> That’s a good point.....but then reality doesn't have a place in this fic....
<Kusanagi> True.....

Ryoko tried to make all the pleasure last a lifetime.

<Kusanagi> Is this a Kodak moment?
<Isamu> I think so.....

But she just couldn't hold back any longer. She orgasmed and cumed in Tenchi's mouth. 

<Isamu> what flavor is that?
<Kusanagi> Cum-bubbly-umcious

Ryoko let Tenchi insert his cock into her pussy and start thrusting.

<Isamu> (in a scotty voice from star trek) Full speed ahead Capin'

 Faster and faster he went. Both of them moaning and groaning and screaming in pleasure! Ryoko
felt the blast of Tenchi's cum as it hit the walls of her pussy with such
force, it almost hurt.

<Isamu> (thinking of the song) "here I am ...rock you like a hurricane*

They laid there for a while,

<Kusanagi> Who's in the wet spot?
 
Tenchi's cock slowly going limp inside Ryoko.
"Well! Was that everything you hoped for?" asked Tenchi after a while. "Oh
yes! And then some!"

<Kusanagi> Then some?

 panted Ryoko, still a little flushed from the pleasure
that she had longed for ever since she met Tenchi. "Well then! Now lets get
to bed then!" Tenchi got off Ryoko and let her get up. She walked, limping
back into her room.
The End!

<Both walk out of theater>

<Kusangai> Wow, what an interesting plot! and all ryoko had to do was ask
<Isamu> Well there's a moral to this lemon, ask and you shall receive...
* The crickets start chirping*
