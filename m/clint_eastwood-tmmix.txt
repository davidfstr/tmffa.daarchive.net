When I heard this song it immediately stuck in my head as a potentially great 
spoof.  And so, after hearing it enough times to mostly memorize it, I decided 
to be the first one to do so.  So, I you havn't heard "Clint Eastwood" by the 
Gorillaz, get off of Mars and take your fingers out your ears and listen to the 
radio, or even better, get the album, which rocks. FYI the band members are:   
2-D, Noodle, Russell, and Murdoc.

OK as always it helps to have the song playing lightly in the background for 
this, or at least in your head while reading.

CLINT EASTWOOD: THE TENCHI MIX

A SONGFIC BY: Ian Sagat

(DRUM BEAT KICKS AND THE BAND MEMBERS COME INTO VIEW ON A TOTALLY WHITE 
BACKGROUND.  TENCHI IS ON MIC, RYOKO IS ON DRUMS, AYEKA IS ON GUITAR AS NOODLE, 
AND WASHU IS ON BASS AS A VERY CRAZY LOOKING MURDOC)

(TENCHI AS THE CHARACTER 2-D)

Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo,
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on.
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on, are comin' on, are comin' on...

(RYOKO AS RUSSELL, WHO IS PLAYING DRUMS, TURNS INTO A GIANT GHOSTLY VERSION OF 
HERSELF AND BEGINS TO RAP)

RRRRRYAAAAAAAHHH!!! YEAH!! HA HA!!!
Finally, someone let me outta my cave,
See, time for me is nothin' 'cause I'm I know I don't age,
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared,
Washu's good at repairs, and Tenchi she'll snare,
Intangible, tried to get a shot but it just went right through,
A galactic view, look, I'll make it all manageable:
Pick and choose, sit and loose, all these different shrews,
Chicks with do's, who you think that Tecnhi's gonna choose?

Picture you getting' down in a bed or two,
Like you've screwed a few, you think it's fictional?
Mystical: maybe, spiritual: Tsunami appears in you to clear your view
'cause your too lazy.
A carnival this, the perfect definition for what life is,
Priceless, I love you and put you up the above the highest,
You like it? Guns smokin' righteous with one token
Sidekick among those Mihoshi is fun though.

(TENCHI)
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on.
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on, are comin' on, are comin' on...

(RYOKO)
The premise: I'm naked out in the onsen allow to make this pornographic in 
nature,
Women: you have 'em or you don't? That's a fallacy,
You'll win 'em, every princess sees even the GP
Even Washu sees, we see with our eyes, we see destruction and demise,
Your virginity: goodbye, from this horny group of five, 
You'll get sucked into our thighs, Ryoko: ain't no joke though,
By the sex that she'll provide.
For me it's tonight, you don't see me now 'cause I phased out through the side,
Please Ayeka: don't spy.
That's the end: So I'ma stick around with Tenchi, be his mentor,
Bust a few moves so next time he'll remember,
I'm the raw chick, I brought all this,
So we can be together when law is lawless,
Fearless: sensations that you thought was dead,
No squealin' Tenchi,
(WHISPERS IN HIS EAR) We'll save that for bed!

(TENCHI)
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on.
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on, 
And I'm happy, I'm felling glad,
I got Lighthawk Wings in a bag,
I'm hopeless, but not for long,
These hot chicks are comin' on, are comin' on, are comin' on...
These hot chicks are comin' on, are comin' on, are comin' on...
These hot chicks are comin' on, are comin' on, are comin' on...



Well, that was a little harder than I thought.  Sorry if it's not totally 
coherent, but the original song isn't either so I just kept to the style.  No 
real message here, just some fun and naughty lyrics.  'Till next time!

Plug: Read my other songfics and my epic, "Tenchi Muyo!: War and Peace", all on 
the TMFFA! Also read Jim "Diabolo" Moore's song and spamfics as well!
