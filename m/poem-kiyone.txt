Kiyone
Emerald hair,
malachite eyes,
jade heart?
What is
this thing
called love?
Is it
so far,
far away
from me?
From my
very soul?
From my
heart of
hearts, beating
alone in
the night?
What is
this thing
called love?

"Kiyone" the poem is mine, and I'd be surprised, not to mention disappointed,
if someone else claimed it as their own.
