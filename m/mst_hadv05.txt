Disclaimer: The MSTed story isn't mine
and I don't want it. What belongs to me
is what I have and what's not is someone

and thus will mock, ridicule, and

<Previously: Shadow, the Guardian, and
the Bard were trapped in the MSTing room
as part of Rowan’s revenge for being left
to the tender mercies of Nurse Washu.
They have just been informed that they
will be forced to MST a lemon, a BAD lemon.>

<Guardian & Shadow>: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Bard: Hacha! All right, finally something juicy!

<Rowan from the control room>: Don’t get your hopes
up hentai. This lemon’s so bad that not even you
could find anything remotely exciting about it.

<Trio>: Agh! Here it comes!!!!

>Tenchi Muyo!

Guardian: Why do I feel a grim foreboding about this fic?

Shadow: Probably because the author isn’t even putting
        their name on this.

Bard: Think Positive!  Think Mihoshi & Kiyone!

>H Adventures Series

Shadow: Not good....there’s an entire series of
        this loose. <Shudders>

>Send all feedback to warpzone32@hotmail.com.

Guardian: Oh you are definitely warped all right!

Shadow: Were you zoned out when you wrote this?

>WARNING!

Bard: Beware of attack pikachu! *BAP*

Guardian: I said NO POKEMON!!!

> This is a lemon fanfiction (as if the first
>four in the series didn't clue you in on that),

Shadow: Dear Gods.....they’re already loose!

>and, well, it has Sasami in it.

<The reviewers’ hair *Twing* out>

Bard: <Turns to stone>
Shadow: You are NOT going there!!!
       <Looks royally pissed off>

Guardian: What the?!.......  <In Shock>

>In fact, it STARS Sasami,

Shadow: [softly] You are soooo dead.

Bard: <Stone shatters>

<Guardian starts turning green>

>and in the end she does end up sleeping with someone.

<Shadow starts to develop the beginnings of a cold
 blue battleaura>

<The other two nervously start to edge away from him>

>^_^  Original, huh?

<All>: NO!!!

Bard: Try stomachturning instead!

Guardian: ...don’t...remind me....

<Shadow’s grip on his chair’s arm starts to
crush the metal frame>

>Hope you like it.

<All>: WE DON”T!!!

> This lemon is deticated

Bard: th..th....That...spelling....it can’t be!!!

Guardian: It’s come back from the abyss of twisted
          lemons to torment the Earth once more!!!

Shadow: It’s the one who’s name is representative
        of all that is evil!!!!

>to Happosai, and to everyone else who cringes
>at the thought of Sasami-based lemons.

<All>: Neither he nor we appreciate this!

>I encourage people who hate Sasami fanfics to
>read this one all the way through.

Bard: We encourage people who hate pedophile
      authors to run this one all the way through.

<Others>: Hear hear!!

>Oh yeah, one other thing.

<All>: This is more then enough!

>People keep telling me that I

Bard: am a disgusting wacko that needs serious
      psychological help?

Guardian: Should be tarred and feathered then
          burned at the stake with hot iron nails
          shoved through your hands for writing this?

Shadow: That’s pretty dark for you......I like it!

>shouldn't spell the princess's name "Aieka."

<All>: That’s because it’s spelled AYEKA!!!

>Well, I don't care!

Shadow: (Fates) We know.

Guardian: (Fates) We know everything.

>Excuse me if I'm not as smart as Washuu.

<The reviewers burst out into hysterical laughter>

Bard: Judging from what we’ve seen so far you’re
      lower on the IQ scale then Tatewaki Kuno!

Shadow; That’s right! Kuno has an IQ of 1, this
        author has no discernible IQ whatsoever!

>Ryohko wouldn't care how to spell Aieka's  name,
>and neither do I. This is my Tenshi fanfic, and
>I can spell the names however I want to.

Guardian: Oh man it IS the reviled one!!!

>No need to start a Sunami of hate mail over it.

<All>: Don’t tempt us!!

>Now, on with the Sasammi story!

<All>: [Scream] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!

*=I made this food up.

<Guardian sees this and quickly goes to the
 portapotty and starts upchucking>

EPISODE 5:

Bard: The MSTer’s Strike back!

Shadow: If only we could.

<The Guardian returns to his seat, looking
 slightly pale and unsteady>

NO NEED FOR PEDOPHILES!

<All>: DAMN RIGHT WE DON’T NEED THEM!!!

>Sasami twisted and squirmed in her sleep,
>caught in the grip of a very potent dream.

Shadow: (Vader) I have you now!

Bard: (Sasami) Let go of me! Help! Dream molester!

Guardian: If I had the strength I’d hit you for that.

>Repeatedly, her mouth opened and closed, mouthing a
>single name.

<All>: (Sasami) Must kill Author....

>Finally, her voice passed her lips, giving sound to the
>name that filled her thoughts.
>
>"Tenchi..."

Bard: Erk...I don’t feel so good.....

>The sound of her own voice awoke Sasami.
> She opened her eyes and realized that it had
>only been a dream.

Shadow: The end.

Guardian: Feeling desperate?

Bard: If only this lemon was a dream.

> Sasami blinked in surprise.

Bard: (Sasami) How’d I end up in this crappy lemon?

>The sheets were twisted around her arms and legs
>in some places.  She was flushed and sweaty.  Sasami
>realized that she felt slightly tingly in a way that
>she couldn't quite describe.

Shadow; And if the author knows what’s good for them
        they won’t describe it!

>Sasami tried to remember what the dream was about, but couldn't.

Guardian: This wouldn’t have happened to us if you
          two hadn’t thrown Rowan to the wolves.

Shadow: Look who’s talking!

>"It must have been annother nightmare," she mused.
> She was glad she couldn't remember this one.

Bard: Now if only we could that.

>Sasami rolled over on the sleeping mat,
>and got up to start the day.

Guardian: (Sasami) Now where did I put those
                   keys for the solar ignition?

>Sasami's eyes widened.  The crotch of her
>pajamas was completely soaked through!

<All>: Ullllllech...blergh......

<The Bard rushes to the portapotty and loses his lunch>

>=^w^=

Shadow: (Dilbert Comic) Must...control...fist..of...death...

>After taking a bath, Sasami dumped her bedsheets into the washing
>machine, along with Aieka's, just in case anyone should walk by and
>wonder what she was up to.

<All>: <wince in dismay>

>  Sasami still wondered about the sticky warm slime
>she had found herself soaked with that morning.

Guardian: (Ghostbuster) I’ve been slimed!

Bard: It’s the Blob!

> She had only had very small wet spots on her panties
>before, but they had been appearing more frequently
>over the past few days.  Most often, they happened
>whenever she thought about boys, especially Tenchi.

Shadow: Tsunami yes. SASAMI ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!

>  Sasami had sometimes seen the same thing on
>Aieka's underwear when she washed it,
>and she remembered embaressing her big sister
>one day when she asked if it meant she was
>thinking about Tenchi, too.

Bard: [weakly] I think the whips and candle wax
               would be dead giveaways.

>  Aieka told her to stop asking about such things,

Shadow: We ask that the author stop writing
        about such things.

>and she she hadn't mentioned it again.  There
>were quite a few other things she had never
>asked her sister about because of her reaction that day.

Bard: Like how to escape from this story.

>Sasami felt a slight tingle.

<All>: We’re feeling a slight nausea.

> It felt like the wetness was starting to creep out of her again.

Shadow: (Sasami) Get back in there!

<The Guardian & the Bard both race to the potty and
 do the technicolor shout>

Bard: [Weakly] That was really low...

> Sasami made sure nobody was looking, then
>lifted the hem of her skirt.  A tiny drop was
>already starting to appear.  Sasami blushed.

Bard; And bled to death, sparing her and us from the lemon scene.

Guardian: Now who’s being dark?

>This could be a real problem if it started happening all the time.

Guardian: And the runner up for the understatement
          of the year goes to....

>Did it mean she was growing up?

<All>: Nope.

Becoming more like her big sister?

<All>: WE SURE HOPE NOT!!!

>Did Aieka go through the day slowly moistening,
>from the time she got up?

Bard: (Chef) Be sure to baste the chicken evenly.

>Was that why she had seen absorbant pads
>advertised for women on Earth television?
>Was this normal?

<All>: Absolutely NOT!

>If it was, she didn't see how anybody
>ever got anything done, it was so distracting.
>Maybe that was why her sister was so cranky all the time...
>
>Sasami shook her head.  She had so many questions,

Shadow: (Sasami) Where's my lawyer?

>she wished her sister had been more willing to talk
>about it and not so embaressed.  But it would have
>to wait until later.  It was time to fix breakfast.

>*>>>

Guardian: This fic is so bad that even the stars
          are running away.

>"That was so good, Sasami!"  Mihoshi giggled.

Bard: Obviously not talking about this story.

>Sasami brightened.

<The reviewers put on sunglasses>

> "Did you really think so?"

Shadow: Did the author actually think?

<All>: Somehow we highly doubt it.

>"I agree with Mihoshi," Kiyone said,

Guardian: (Kiyone) We should escape from this
          lemon while we still can.

>ruffling the younger princess's hair.
>"I think this was probably the best I've had in my life."
>
>"Well, thank you."  Sasami smiled.  She was
>glad everybody had liked her breakfast; she
>had found it difficult to concentrate while preparing
>breakfast, and was worried that she might have made a mistake.
>
>"It was absoloutely delicious, Sasami," Aikea said.
>
>"Are there any more red sweet bean paste
>cake buns* left?" Ryoko asked.
>
>"Miyaaa," Ryo-ohki chimed in.
>
>Aieka helped clear the table as Tenchi and the
>others left to start the day.
>
>"Guess I'll go take a bath," Ryoko said, glancing
>pointedly at Aieka

Bard: (Ayeka) Quit pointing that at me Ryoko!

>Aieka was really annyoed when her heart seemed
>to skip.

Bard: (Heart) lalalalala....

>"Just a sceond... i think i'll join you Mis... erm...

<All three look ill>

>miss Ryoko."

<All> We miss her already.

Sasami smiled as she did the dishes, thinking about
Tenchi.  She hummed the Sailor Q theme to herself

Shadow: Egads..that guy from Star Trek gets around.

>as she washed those little triangular dish
>thingies that I don't know what they're called.

Guardian: Don't feel bad, we have the same trouble with you.

>Suddenly she felt a brush against her inner calve
>and almost jumped.

Bard: (Sasami) Little Washu stop using me as a canvas!
       <Cringes for the expected statue on the head>

>"Miyaaa!!"

<The Bard looks up and sighs in relief when the
 hurting doesn't commence>

"AH!! Ryo-ohki!  You startled me!" Sasami game

<All>: Let's play the Pretty Sammy game!

>the cabbit a cookie and a pat on the head.  "What is it?"
>
>"Miyaa...miyaaa."  The cabbit morphed into a little girl.
>  "Miyaa!!"

Bard: Maybe I relaxed too soon....*gulp*

>"Oh... Ryo-ohki... do you want to help?  Is that it...?"
> Sasami handed Ryo-ohki a towel, and watched in wonder
>as the cabbit-turned-girl helped her dry the dishes.
>
>"That's terrific," Sasami cried, "I always knew you could
>do stuff like this, Ryo-ohki!  The others just don't see
>it 'cuz they think of you as a pet..." Sasami guessed
>Ryoko probably knew how smart her ship was...
>She wondered if Tenchi knew that Ryo-ohki could do things more
>complicated than carrying bushels of carrots for him?

Guardian: I do not like where this is going.

>"Tenchi..."  Sasami sighed as she thought about Tenchi.
>  An image popped into her mind of one time when she had
> seen Tenchi shirtless.  Sasami blushed and tried to banish
>the image, but she just couldn't stop thinking about it, and
>how cute he looked, and a feeling much more alien
>to her that she couldn't even begin to understand...

<All>: Argh! It’s a Chestbuster!

>Sasami gasped as she felt something cold against her thigh.

<Shadow is very quiet all of a sudden>

> She looked down and realized that there was a damp spot
>soaked all the way through her skirt, that it had cooled in the
>air and was now cold and wet when it touched her skin.

Bard: The cold sweat of fear.

>"EEEP!!"  Sasami dropped her rag and ran from the kitchen,
>covering the wet spot ashamedly with both hands.
>  "I'll be right back!" she called to the cabbit.

Guardian: Take your time!

>"Miyaa...?"  Ryo-ohki carefully set down the dish she
had been drying, turned into cabbit-form, and bounded
>down the hall after her favorite person.  She was
>worried about Sasami.

<All>: So are we!

>[o==]{

Bard: Hey look! It’s an off switch!

<Shadow and the Guardian>: Flip it!

Bard:<trying> Damn....it’s broken.

>Sasami tried to relax as she gathered up her bath
>things in a small wooden pail.  Ryo-ohki had phased
>through the door just as she tied the sash on her
>clean skirt.  She had quickly finished the dishes, then
>excused herself for annother bath.  She wanted to wash
>this sticky stuff away and never feel it again.

Shadow: We sympathize, we don’t ever want to see this fic again.

>It was uncomfortable and, well...embaressing.

Bard: Not to mention horrifying for us.

>Sasami groaned as she thought about how she wasn't
>supposed to think about tenchi, and then of course
>that called up an image of his smiling face.

<All>: Resist...please...resist!

>  Sasami sighed.  she realized with a start that she
>had been sitting on the floor with her bath things
>for many minutes, and that her panties were once
>again drenched.

<Unable to control it again the Bard becomes violently ill in his seat>

Shadow:<Turns toward the Bard> You’re cleaning that up afterwards.

>Sasami smiled.  The strange sensation sure felt good.
>If only it didn't make such a mess, Sasami wouldn't
>have minded it in the least.  For just a moment she felt
>a little bit ashamed at enjoying something that she
>should have been disgusted at... then that's when it hit her.

Guardian: Sasami died. The end.

Shadow: Hey! I’m the only dark one here!

>It was something that felt good but also kinda
>guilty...  It must have something to do with sex!

Guardian: I sure as hell hope not!!!

>She had heard of sex, of course.  But she didn't know
>or understand anything about it.  What little she had
>been privy to had come largely from Earth TV, before
>Washuu had adjusted the set to pick up galactic
>standard programming.

Bard: So the normal programming for intergalactic
      television is alien porn?

Shadow: Explains a lot doesn’t it.

> (Well, why did YOU think they were watching a
>soap opera about two giant penguis!?)

<All>: Because they were bored!

>But Aieka had refused to answer any of her questions
>on the subject. Then one day, Aieka had confronted
>sasami, and asked her if she was really growing up
>this fast, and if she truly needed answerers to these
>questions.  Aieka had told her, almost tearfully,
>that the only one who could properly explain these
>things would be her mother.  Sasami had realized what
>that would mean.  The vacation on Earth would have to end,
>Sasami and Aieka would return to Jurai, and Aieka would
>never see Tenchi again.  Sasami didn't want that, for she
>could also see that her sister was in love with Tenchi.

Guardian: Welcome to Feminine Dirty Tactics 101.

>So she curbed her tongue and said no, she was just
>curious, and after that day she didn't try to solve
>the mysteries for herself.  She resolved to avoid Earth TV
>shows where she knew she could see sex.

Shadow: In Japan?! What universe is this???

>  She had been very young then and it didn't
>really intrest her at all, except out of curiosity.
>Now Sasami wondered if she could remember what it
>had looked like.  She had hardly gotten a glimpse
>before Tenchi had come in, yelling something
>at his fatherabout watching these things when she
>was around.

Shadow: Even Nobuyuki isn’t that much of a hentai!

>It had looked like... two naked people... hugging?
> Sasami wondered what it would feel like to hug
>Tenchi like that...

<All>: NOOOO!!!!!!!

>Sasami gasped as a shiver ran through her.  She had to
>stop daydreaming and go take her bath!!
>
>(:.)XXXXX{{

Bard: Welcome to the Brooklin Bridge.

>Sasami wished she could think of any boy other than
>Tenchi, but he was really the only boy she had ever
>known well enough to admire...
>certianly the nicest boy she had ever known.
>  She wanted Aieka to be happy with him, but
>sometimes... she wondered what it would have been
>like in her perfect world, if things had been allowed
>to continue just a little while longer...

<All>: Make it stop!!!

>Sasami silently slid open the door to the bath.
>
>"Mmmmm... mmph.. Ryoko..."
>
>"Oh, Aieka!"

Guardian: Oh Gods...

>Sasami silently slid closed the door to the bath.
>
>THAT is what it would have been like, she thought!
> Except that theyprobably would have been clothed...
>Sasami opened the door and took annother peek.  Her
>eyes widened as the two of them kissed and touched
>each other...  why was Ryoko wearing a black mask?

<All three reviewers facefault after seeing that>

>Sasami got ahold of herself as she realized her
>sister might catch her looking.  Aieka's eyes were
>closed, and Ryoko's back was turned, but for
>how long?  She didn't want Aieka to catch her watching
>her have sex, it might mean that she would have to go
>back to Jurai.  And that was even before the turmoil
>of her emotions entered into it...
>
>Sasami closed the door again and sat back on her
>knees.  She could feel it, the warm, sticky,
>strange-smelling fluid trickling down her leg.

Bard: She isn’t old enough for that!!!

Shadow: Welcome to Lemon Logic for Dummies.

>Desperately, she ran into her room and wiped
>away what she could with kleenex. She had to
>get out of here so she could relax.

<All>: We need to get out of here before we go insane!!!

>Thinking about Tenchi was no longer a problem, she had to
>forget about what she had just seen in the bathroom!
>
>=~,~=

Shadow: Pull the plug on this already!

>Sasami walked the endless halls of Washuu's lab, an
>affectionate cabbit perched atop her head.

<All>: Bleeeeccck......

>"At least now I know why Aeika and Ryoko fight all the
>time," she thought to herself. "I wonder if they're
>really in love, or just going out..."  Sailor Moon,
>Ranma 1/2, and Those Obnoxious Aliens had accustomed
>her young innocent mind to the idea of diffrent kinds of
>romances... she had just never thought it through before
>that Zoicite and Maramou were also probabaly having sex.

Guardian: Don’t try to blame someone else for this!

>She felt that she had betrayed Aieka even by
>realizing this.  But... she couldn't keep her
>ignorance forever... right?  It was normal to go
>through these things as you got older... so she
>had to learn about it sooner or later... right?

<All>: WRONG!!!

>Sasami sighed sadly and stared into a tank of what
>looked to be glowing green jellyfish with dull red
>cores.  Maybe if she didn't go back to
>Jurai, she wouldn't ever understand sex.
>
>"You know," Washuu said, "They could drain the energy
>out of your body in a matter of seconds!"
>
>Sasami smiled a little bit, and turned to find Washuu
>behind her, half a head shorter.  "That's what you said
>about the Paramites," she said.
>
>"Heh heh heh..." Washuu floated up on a pillow and
>looked sasami in the eye.  "No no, the Paramites drain
>your bodily fluids...  these little fellas are much
>more elegent in their attack..." Washuu's voice went to
>an evil melodramatic rasp, which only made Sasami giggle.
>  "They stalk their prey silently by drifting on air
>currents... then they latch onto your head... and drain
> the energy slowly from you at the molecular level!
>They can suck the power right out of life forms, machinery..."
>Washuu's voice went to a whisper... "even forcefields!"

Bard: Does that mean they could kill this fic?

Guardian: One can always hope...

>Sasami's eyes went wide with alarm!  The only thing that
>kept her from taking Washuu's lab pets seriously was the
>fact that there were forcefields seperating them from herself!
>
>"Heh heh heh... however, in their natural larve state they
>are extremely physically weak!  Even a pane of glass will
>stop them!"
>
Sasami sighed in relief, then began to laugh...  "That was
>mean of you, Washuu!" Sasami's warm giggle betrayed her
>words.  "But it did help me to forget about my problem...
> thanks."
>
>"Any time."  Washuu petted Ryo-ohki on the head.  "So,
>is this problem anything the Greatest Genius in the
>Universe can help you with...?"

<All>: NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

>Sasami smiled nervously and turned away...  she blushed
>slightly.  "Um... actually, Washuu... it's kind of
>something that I don't think you could help me with...
>you see... it's about... um..."  Sasami leaned
>over close to Washuu.  "...sex," she whispered.
>
>Washuu smiled, and chuckled sadly to herself.  When would
>these petty mortals learn that there was no knowlage
>that was beyond her grasp?

Bard: If she grasps what I think she’s gonna grasp I’m gonna start screaming

>}0{<

Guardian: It’s official, this fic has just laid an egg.

>Sasami smiled as she closed the door to Washuu's sub-space room.

Bard: (From behind his covered eyes) Is it over?

Shadow: (Peeks) I think so.

>She felt much better now than she had in a long time.

Guardian: Danger! Danger!! Hentai tone detected!

>Washuu was just great.

<All>: AAAAAARGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!

> Incredible, even.  She had very carefully and quietly
>explained all about sex and growing up to the young
>princess, in words that she could understand and a
>soothing voice.

All: (Megablink)

All: Whew!

>She was a great teacher.

Guardian: Uh oh.....

>Sasami was no longer afraid of the changes
>taking place in her body.  She knew for sure
>that what was happening was natural and
>normal, and she kind of had an idea what to
>expect as she continued to blossom.

Shadow: Of course realizing that it is going to take awhile first!

> It was okay now, and she knew it was true,
>because the smartest lady in the universe had told her so.
>
>Sasami had then asked Washuu if she was actually too
>young to be going through this. But no, she had learned,
>she was not,

Bard: What a load of......

Guardian: What did the author do with the real Sasami?!

<Shadow eye starts twitching>

> She said that the Juraian coming-of-age ceremony at the age
>of 25 was not nessessarily the right time for everybody to
>start having sex.  She said it was an immaginary age that
>grownups used for a reference point, that it had to do with
>how old someone needed to be in order to have kids, and also
>it had to do with how mature the adults thought their children
>had to be in order to live responsibly.

Bard: Welcome to the pedophile’s version of history and Juraian customs.

(At this point the Guardian gets desperate and starts
 trying to destroy the fic)

Unforunately for the trio, this is a Washu-chan invention.

<All>: DAMN!!!

Get back to the fic.

>The point was, despite jurian standards, it was not
>wrong or unnatural for her or her big sister to be
>experiencing this before the age of 25.

Guardian: ITS WRONG AND UNNATURAL FOR SASAMI TO BE EXPOSED TO THIS!!!
(Starts raving in anger)

Bard: Must..not...go...stark...raving...mad.....

>It was almost time for her to feed her latest
>Earthling TV addiction, Pikachu.

Guardian: AAAARRGGGGGGHHHH!!!!!

Shadow: Looks like he snapped.

(Rowan’s voice): One down, two to go.

Bard: Help me!!!!

>(... or was it called Pokemon?  shit... I need to
>start getting up early... can you believe they put
>it on at 5 am!?  This is exactly what happened with
>Dragon Ball Z.  They CAN'T put it on in the afternoons,
>NOOOOO, THAT spot goes to Samurai Pizza Cats, of all
 childrens anime!!!)

Shadow: You can kiss the fourth wall goodbye now.

>The commercial she happened to flip onto was advertising skin.
>  No, strike that, it was actually advertising a heath club.

Shadow: What’s the difference?

>But there was so much skin filling the screen, and it belonged
>to so many attractive people, that Sasami could barely see parts
>of the health club.

Guardian: ..........deh..........evil.....

Bard: You can’t leave us like this! Are you a man or a mouse?!

Guardian: squeek squeek!

Bard: That’s not funny!!!

>Sasami squirmed as she pressed her legs together, trying
>to ignore the juices as they squelched from their hiding place.

Bard: Take the bottle out from between your knees. Problem solved.

Shadow; You actually avoided a hentai riff? I’m starting to worry.

Bard: I can’t keep this up much longer.....

>"I forgot to ask Washuu what to do about this..." she sighed sadly.

Shadow: I CAN’T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!!!!

(Shadow’s aura appears again and goes from cold blue to fiery red, expanding
to form the image of a giant winged dragon)

Shadow: RAGING MEGA-FLARE!

(The Dragon’s mouth releases a blazing cone of energy toward the fic)

*BOOM*

Shadow: (Panting from exhaustion)

(Rowan from the control room): That wasn’t smart.

Guardian: THE FIC’S OVER HAHAHAHAHA!!!!

Bard: YES!!!!!

(Rowan): Nope, all he did was blast away most of the
 non-hentai material right before the....big....pardon
 the pun....climax to this piece of garbage.

<All> NOOOOOOOO!!!!! DAMN YOU ROWAN!!!!

> "Sasami, does that happen, um... often to you?"

Bard: (Sasami) No, only in crappy lemons.

>"Oh, no," Sasami said, "It's just today that it's
>been really bad for the first time.

Guardian: No.......more....double...meanings.....

Shadow: The Shatner syndrome is spreading.

>I had a talk with Washuu, though, so it's okay... I
>know what's going on..." she looked up at Tenchi
>innocently.  "I forgot to ask her how to stop it, though..."

Bard: PLEASE!!! DON’T GO THERE!!!!

>Tenchi tried not to smile at the look on her face, then he
>tried to smile reassuringly, then he tried to stop smiling
>because he was worried it would just look like a stupid
>grin after all that thought beforehand about how it would
>look.  It turns out he needn't have worried, for the
>animators drew all three expressions the same way.
>
>"Come with me," Tenchi said, taking her gently by the hand.
> "I can show you how to get some releif..."

<All>: (OoO)    WHAT?!!!!!!!!

Bard: It’s a pod person!!!!

Shadow: KILL!!!!!!!!

Guardian: I can’t believe I’m saying this.....DITTO!!!!!!!!!!!

>Sasami's ears turned bright red as she let Tenchi
>lead her to his room.

<All>: NOOOO!!!!! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!

>"Umm... okay..." she said, feeling like she was floating.
>
>O_O!

Bard: Oh, NOW YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU JUST DID!!!!

>Sasami left Tenchi's room feeling more relaxed than she had in days.

<All>: (Catatonic)

>"That was just incredible, Tenchi,"  she told him as she
>prepared dinner that evening.  "And your Grandpa taught you that?"

<All>: OH GODS IT GETS WORSE!!!!

>"Yes," Tenchi said, "It always helps me whenever I feel...
>erm... that way."

Guardian: Please let it be something that does not
          involve anything starting with S or M.

Shadow: Or both.

>Sasami smiled brightly.  Tenchi had taught her a meditation
>technique that relaxed her and cleared her mind of dirty
>thoughts. Now she knew what she could do whenever her
>fantasies became too strong for her.

<All>: (Sigh in relief)

>"Thank you, Tenchi," she said, giving him a light
>kiss on the cheek.

Shadow: You know I’m getting a sneaking suspicion that
        something’s not right here.

>------=<B

<All>: Quit drooling you pervert!

>Sasami brushed her teeth.  She changed into a nightgown.
>She said the prayers appropriate to whatever religion she is.

Shadow: The fic ended.

Guardian: Stop giving us false hope.

Bard: Almost...finished....must...hang...on...

>(Christian? Buddhist?  Shinto?  Something Jurian?
>Self-worship because she's Tsunami???)  She made her
>sister's sleeping mat for her, just in case
>she felt like going to bed right away after her
>two-hours-and-counting bath.
>
>In other words, Sasami was getting ready for bed.

<All>: Gee we didn't know that already!

>Suddenly, there was a horrible screeching noise.

Shadow; The horrible reshaping of reality by the fic
        could no longer be handled and the story
        shattered into a million pieces.

Bard: Ayeka found out who wrote this and let the
      whip start cracking.

Guardian: That was the sound of our sanity snapping.

>  Sasami had no idea what it could be, it sounded
>like a car with a broken police siren slamming on
>its breaks while running over a group of very loud cats,
>except it happened slower and lasted a lot longer
>than such a noise really would, if it had happened.

<All>: Oh, it's just Ranma meeting Ryo-ohki for the first time.

>Curious, Sasami peeked out of the window, only to
>find Ryo-ohki standing on the roof. She was naked,
>in older humanoid-girl form, and stood staring up
>at the stars, with tears running down her cheeks slowly.

<All>: OH NO!!!

>Before Sasami could say anything, Ryo-ohki made the sound again.
>
>"Ryo-ohki!  What's wrong?"

Guardian: (Ryo-ohki) I've been put in this lemon too!!!

>Sasami asked.  Ryo-ohki pouted and turned
>her head to look at Sasami, then looked back
>up at the night sky.
>
>"Oh," Sasami said, realizing, "You miss Ken-ohki, don't you?"
>
>"Miyaa..."  The older girl nodded sadly, and stepped inside
>the window to be with her Sasami.

<All>: BLEAHHH!!!!

>Sasami sighed.  Ryo-ohki didn't strike her as the type
>that would be able to meditate well.  Suddenly Sasami
>had an idea of what might cheer Ryo-ohki up.

Bard: No way!!! Not that!!!!

>"I know," Sasami said, "I saw Aieka doing this once and
>it cheered her up..."

Shadow: Throwing darts at a picture of Ryoko isn't going to help.

>Sasami walked over to Aieka's underwear drawers,

Guardian: I'm in pain right now....

>and carefully removed something from the very bottom
>without disturbing anything.  It was about a foot long,
>bright pink, and was made of smooth, slick rubber.
>It had a slight buldge at one end and a switch on it.

<All>: Oh Shit....

> this was annother one of the things Sasami had not
>asked Aieka about, but now she had a pretty good
>idea what it was used for.

Bard: All in favor of killing this author?

<All>: AYE!!!

Shadow: All opposed?

(???): Neigh!

<All> WHO???

(Turning they see the one that gave Artemis Nightmares)

<All>: AAAAA!!! KILL IT!!!!

(The trio proceed to vent their fustrations on the
 Unholy one and flush the remains down the toilet.)

>Ryo-ohki looked down at the thing and then back at Sasami.
> "Miyaa...?" she said, a look of intense curiosity on her face.

Shadow: (Ryo-ohki translated) So I hit the author over
                              the head with this?

>Sasami smiled.  "You can go use it in the spare room,"
>she said, "nobody's using it right now."

>Ryo-ohki phased through the wall and left quickly to try
>the strange device out.  Moments later, Sasami heard the
>cabbit making noises similar to the ones Aieka had made.

Bard: spew.......*FREAKS OUT*

(Rowan): And then there was one....

> It certianly sounded a lot better than the noises she
>had made on the roof.  After about twently minutes
>of this, the sounds died down.  Sasami smiled.
>She was glad she couldc help Ryo-ohki feel better.

Shadow: I'm not going to be feeling better for a long time....

>A few minutes later, a grey blur wisked in through the door
>and under Sasami's covers.

Shadow: Erk.....

>  Sasami giggled as it crawled up to the pillow.

Shadow: .......no.....

> She kissed the little furry cabbit on the nose,

Shadow:....a.gh......

>and went to sleep, and her dreams that night were peaceful ones.
>
>THE END.

<Bard & Guardian>: PRAISE KAMISAMA!!! IT'S OVER!!!!

(Rowan appears with Washu-chan)

Rowan: So how was it?

<Bard & Rowan>: The only reason why we're not going to kill you
                is that the author had intelligence to not put
                Sasami in an actual act of carnal activity.

Washu-chan: Say...What about Shadow here....Hmmm...

(Waves her hand in front of him......Shadow doesn't blink)

Washu-chan: Looks like he's unconscious.

Rowan: Remember this, next time it'll be much much worse.

(The Bard gets in the crouch of the Wild Tiger)

Washu-chan: And now for your physicals!

Guardian: eep!

*$*$*$*$*$*

Author's notes: Surprised? I did say that this would be
                a bad lemon, I just didn't say how bad
                it would be. But Sasami Lemons are still
                EVIL!!!
