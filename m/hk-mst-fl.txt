In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki,who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!!
Ryoko:Rock On
Washu:I'm a genius
Ayeka:TENCHI
Sasami:I'm so cute
Ryo-ohki:MEOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

(Inside Spaceship-Ryo-Oki)

::Sasami is leaning against a wall, holding a teacup that is empty. She
turns as she
watches some water on a nearby heating element.::
<Sasami>*sigh* This is taking forever.
::Washu enters. She pauses for a moment, then walks past the control cabin,
towards
Sasami.::
<Washu>What is taking forever, Sasami?
<Sasami>This water. It seems like water just takes so long to boil, I don't
know why it is.
<Washu>Hm. Interesting.
::Washu gestures and her virtual computer materializes.::
<Washu>Of course, any clod can just increase the temperature, but that is
hardly a
challenge. What if we altered the composition of water. . . .so. . . .
::Washu enters some commands and a pyrex of 'water' pops out from a hole
that suddenly
appears out of nowhere::
<Washu>Here, try boiling this. It's just the same old hydrogen and oxygen.
<Sasami>Uh, what?
<Washu>Just try it.
<Sasami>Okay, if you say so.
::Sasami dumps the kettle into a drainage area, and the water runs through
the workings
of Ryo-Oki and voids into space. She then pours Washu's 'water' into the
kettle. Just
then Ryoko, Ayeka and Tenchi enter::
<Ryoko>Sasami, is there water for tea? I'm dying for a cup.
<Tenchi&Ayeka>So are we, come to think of it.
<Sasami>Well, I just put the water on, it should be five minutes, I guess.
<Tenchi>What do you mean? It looks like it's boiling now!
::Sasami turns to see the steam rising from the kettle she put on the heat
only seconds
ago::
<Sasami>How about that. Ok, everyone get ready for tea!
::As Sasami is serving tea to everyone, a large screen appears with Dr. Clay
on it.::
<Washu>Well, well, well, it's Squiddily Diddily.
<Ryoko>Either that or a chia pet.
::The others sip their tea.::
<Dr.Clay>QUIET. Today's fic is by a very, very horny person who is also
totally
clueless about romance. Coincidence? I think not. Anyway, have fun barfing
your guts
out. Enjoy, muahahhahahahahah, not! Trick, beyotches!!!!
*Clay dispappears*
<Washu>Amazing that clod is even still alive.
<Ryoko>I wouldn't call that living.
::Suddenly there's lots of flashing lights and crazy noises::
<Sasami>We have fanfic sign!
::In the chaos, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi slip into the theatre. They fail to
notice that the
presence of Washu's new 'water' seems to have caught Ryo-Oki's attention for
some
reason. . .::

Forbidden Love
Author: Bubbles

<Tenchi>Oh boy. We're in for quite a ride.
<Ryoko>Hold me, Ayeka.
<Ayeka>What!?!
<Ryoko>Sorry, I was just trying to brace you for the wild OOC that
undoubtedly is to
follow.

This takes place about 4 years in the future…

<Tenchi>Thanks, that really tells us a lot.
<Ayeka>(As Optimus Prime)The year is: four years in the future, AD.

The birds twittered and sang as Tenchi walked inside.
The Masaki household may have been a little on the odd side, but it was what
Tenchi
liked to call home.

<Ryoko>It being, you know, where he lived and stuff like that..

He hung his coat, then walked towards the kitchen. Ryo-oki jumped out in
front of him
and mewed with glee. "Hey Ryo-oki! How was your day?" asked Tenchi.
"Meeewwww!" Ryo-oki replied. Tenchi laughed.

<Tenchi>What, I know cabbit now?
<Ryoko>Just ignore the inept attempt to appear to be writing an actual fic
here and lets
shut up until they get to the sex, probably only a few short lines from this
point.
<Ayeka>Jurian porn would never have such a shoddy buildup. Although there
would
probably be at least 45 minutes of the guy and girl chasing each other
around a tree that
alternatively scolded and aroused them.

"Do you know where Ayeka is?" Tenchi asked. Ryo-oki meowed then pointed to
the
table by the stairs. Tenchi walked over to it and looked down. Upon it was a
note that
read, "Come upstairs, honey bunny. I've got a surprise for you. -Ayeka"
Tenchi chuckled,
thinking it was probably some more of those disgusting cookies she baked.
They tasted
horrible, but he never wanted to hurt her feelings so he said they were
good. "Have fun,
Ryo-oki," Tenchi said, then trudged slowly up the stairs. When he got to the
top stair he
saw another note placed upon it. This one read, "In my bedroom, you sexy
thing." Tenchi
gulped at this note, then proceeded to Ayeka's bedroom. He slowly opened her
door,
unaware of what lay inside.

<Ryoko>Only to find Yosho enthusiastically humping Ayeka. He saw the note
and
thought it was for him.
<Ayeka>'Enthusiastically?' Mr. glare off his glasses probably doesn't even
remember
where it goes.
<Tenchi>Do we have to talk about this?

Ayeka was lying on the bed, in black lingerie.

<Ryoko>Whakka-pakka-whakka-pakka-whakka-pakka-whakka-pakka.
<Tenchi>Not bad. But where's the depressing saxophone music?
<Ryoko>Sorry, Bill Clinton isn't available.
<Ayeka>Oh, if only I was cheap enough to actually do this.
<Ryoko>Maybe if you got a telemarketer job, or brought that Matthew Lesko
book?
<Ayeka>Hm. . . .

Again, Tenchi gulped. Ayeka giggled. "Do you like my new lingerie Tenchi? I
got it at
Victoria's Secret.

<Ayeka>I don't know what victoria's secret is, but I'm guessing it's
bedwetting as a teen.
<Ryoko>Either that or she just likes to dress like a slut. A lot.

And you know what else? I bought it just for you," she said, with a
seductive expression
on her face.

<Ryoko>Wow, those slut lessons from Keone really did pay off.
<Ayeka>Actually, all I did was watch the spice channel for two weeks
straight. Fib.

"How thoughtful of you," Tenchi replied, then smiled the best he could.
Ayeka gestured
him to her side. Tenchi stumbled over, and sat down next to her. Ayeka stood
up, then sat
down in Tenchi's lap with her legs wrapped around his waist. She undid his
belt, then
slowly unzipped his fly, revealing his hard member.

<Ryoko>Member? Got to love it when the author's hot to write about sex but
can't bring
themselves to avoid using a stupid word like member.
<Tenchi>And on that note, we slide into cut and pasted text from Delta of
Venus.
<Ayeka>Delta of Venus? Lukewarm trash. If you want real passion, you must
read the
Jurian classic "The Seed Of Love Starts at Home."
<Tenchi>Um, maybe after I finish Story of the Stone. Three times.
<Ayeka>Sasami has had my copy for the last 200 years and won't return it
anyway.

She pulled down his pants, then slipped his erect penis up through the
gopher hole in his
boxers. She began to suck it vigorously, as a wave of pleasure swept over
Tenchi.

<Tenchi>(to fic Ayeka)Who are you, and what have you done with Ayeka?
<Ayeka>Oh, lord Tenchi, I knew you knew I would never, ever do this.
<Tenchi>I know. (winks at Ryoko).
::Ryoko looks puzzled for a moment, then sticks her tongue out at Tenchi for
a second.
Both try not to crack up.::

He and Ayeka had been together for almost 4 months now, and he knew she
loved him.
He even used to love her, but his feelings for her had been muffled
recently.

<Tenchi>So, I don't get it. What's the surprise here?
<Ryoko>The surprise is that Ayeka didn't just finish off Azaka, Kamedake,
and Sasami
about 10 minutes earlier. I mean, heck, if you're going to cross the
rubicon, you might as
well conquer rome.
<Ayeka>That would be splintery. Ow.

Normally the blowjob she was giving him now would seem be a token of her
love to him,
but not with the dreams he had been having lately.

<Tenchi>I wonder if they mean that dream about that guy who asking if I have
any
waaaaasssa-bi.
<Ayeka>That's not a dream, that's all those stupid American tourists.
<Tenchi>Oh, yeah.

Not with the thoughts that had been running through his mind. Ayeka removed
her grip
on his penis and pushed him down flat on the bed. She stood up, then removed
her bra.
Her chest was rather flat, but to Tenchi, that didn't matter.

<Tenchi>Flat breasts? No breasts? It doesn't matter. Come to happy bob's
auto
showroom, and no matter what size your chest is, we'll make a deal!
<Ayeka>Huh?
<Tenchi>Oh, nothing.

She then took off her panties, revealing her nether lips to him.

<Tenchi>Nether lips? What the hell are they talking about?
<Ryoko>Beats me.
<Ayeka>Me too.

She knelt down, slipped off his boxers and shirt, then knelt down on him,
letting his shaft
slide smoothly into her.

<Tenchi>This must be really fascinating to anyone who has never actually
done this.

She shouted with pleasure and threw her hands in the air. Tenchi lay there,
motionless on
the bed, not making any efforts. His thoughts knew nothing of what was going
on. There
was only one thing on his mind. The creature that recently had been always
in his
thoughts. The creature that recently had been always in his dreams. The fair
maiden who
he secretly cried out for. Ryoko. Ayeka gasped and squealed as she climaxed.

<Tenchi>Well, there's proof that whoever wrote this knows nothing about sex.
<Ryoko>Yeah, nothing's more satisfying than when your partner doesn't even
make an
effort or even bother to notice what's going on.

This brought Tenchi to reality. He knew he couldn't do this anymore.

<Ayeka>I'll get the viagara then.
<Ryoko>Any of that lemon drug stuff left over?
<Ayeka>No, we used it all on Yugi.
<Ryoko>Oh, right. That was fun.

He couldn't keep ignoring these feelings. As Ayeka shouted out his name, he
pulled out.

<Ryoko>(as Ayeka)Oh Yosho. . .I mean Tenchi! Tenchi!
<Ayeka>Hmmph.
<Tenchi>Yawn. As if this is interesting. "Oh, a fic about some or all of the
space chicks
doing Tenchi." How original.
<Ryoko>I'm glad at least you're not enjoying this much in this fic. Then
again, who
would?
<Ayeka>*whimpers*
<Tenchi>Hey, I just noticed, I didn't even ejaculate. Thanks, fic author,
for making me
seem even more pre-pubescent.
<Ayeka>Hey, yeah! Where's the cream filling?

She threw herself down on the bed next to him, gasping for breath. He stood
up and
began to put his clothes back on.
"Wasn't that wonderful, dear?" Ayeka said, breathing heavily.

<Tenchi>Yes, what porn movie were we re-enacting?
<Ayeka>All of them, I think.

Tenchi zipped up his fly then walked out of the room without responding.
* * * * * * * *
"Ryoko, could you pass the potatoes?" Mihoshi asked.

<Ryoko>Got to love the ease of the transition. Sex. Potatoes. It's so
graceful.
<Tenchi>Maybe they're building up to a stunning literary climax involving
both sex and
potatoes.
<Ayeka>We can only hope.

"Of course," Ryoko answered, then handed them to Tenchi, who handed them to
Mihoshi. "Does anyone know where Ayeka is?"

<Tenchi>She's in her trailer. They had to ice her down again and she's
running on the
treadmill, wearing a pink headband and trying to remember her seven lines
for the
entirety of "Jurian Royalty Revue 16."

"Oh, she was tired so she's napping now. I'm sure she'll be down in an hour
or so," Tenchi
replied.
"Tired from what?" Mihoshi asked with a smug look on her face.

<Ryoko>Being possessed by a horny fanfic writer.

"Oh, just tired," Tenchi responded. Mihoshi bent down to Ryo-oki and the too
started
whispering and giggling with devilish expressions. Tenchi rolled his eyes.

<Tenchi>There's that music again! Quit it, you two!
<Ryoko>Whakka-pakka-whakka-pakka-wha- rats.

"Cut it out you two!" Ryoko yelled, then threw a piece of ham at them. It
hit Ryo-oki,
and she fell down onto the floor. Tenchi chuckled, then smiled sweetly at
Ryoko. Ryoko
blushed.

<Tenchi>I just love it when you throw ham at a cabbit, baybee. It makes me
so randy.

"Well, after we eat I need someone to help me carry the baskets of corn down
from the
fields. Any takers?" asked Ryoko.
"I will!" Tenchi shouted, reflexive.

<Tenchi>And if you need any plumbing done, I can do that, too! I mean,
whatever.

Everyone chattered as they finished eating. Ryo-oki still lay on the floor.
* * * *
"So Tenchi, why WAS Ayeka so tired?" Ryoko asked as she and Tenchi headed
out to
the cornfield. It was dusk, and as night fell the world seemed to stir,
rather than quiet
itself.
"Why do you want to know?" Tenchi replied.
"I don't know. Just curious, I guess."

<Tenchi>She was taking a ride on the Tenchi trampoline.
<Ryoko>Pumpin the piston.
<Ayeka>Paying a visit to Mr. Slim.
<Tenchi>Polishin the pole.
<Ryoko>Mining the Jurai Juice.
<Tenchi>(as Austin Powers)Ah shagged her rotten, baybee, yeah!
<Ryoko>(singing, to the tune of 'You Made Me Love You')You made me do you/I
didn't
wanna love it/I didn't wanna love it.

"I see." The two continued down to the cornfield without saying much to each
other.
They walked into the first row and began plucking corn and placing it into a
basket.

<Tenchi>Wow, you really did want to just harvest corn. What a relief.
<Ryoko>Oh, by the way, here's a bug.
<Tenchi>A bug?
<Ryoko>Harvest Moon 64 joke.

"Tenchi," Ryoko said calmly. "You know I love you and will always love you,
and you
know that I am and will always be jealous of your relationship with Ayeka,
but I wanted
you to know that I am truly happy for you. I really just want you to be
happy, even if it
means you being with Ayeka."
"Thank you Ryoko," Tenchi replied, then smiled. "That was one of the nicest
things I
think I've ever heard you say."

<Tenchi>Yeah, it's up there with "You must have been crazy to think Ryo-Oki
was
Tenchi's child."
<Ryoko>Oh, we do have fun, don't we?

Ryoko smiled back. "Well, I mean it. I just wish I could be as happy as you.
I don't think
there is a man out there who would ever be attracted to me. Sometimes I just
think I'm the
most repulsive thing on the planet, and I'm destined to walk the earth
alone." She said, as
a tear ran down her cheek.

<Tenchi>Crud. The fic got good on us.
<Ryoko>Ssh, I'm trying to read this.

Tenchi turned to face Ryoko and placed his hand softly on Ryoko's face,
wiping away her
tears. "Ryoko," he said. "You are one of the most beautiful things I have
ever seen. Any
man who doesn't fall for you, or think you're completely gorgeous, is the
repulsive one."
After this comment Ryoko just couldn't help herself. She threw herself at
Tenchi, giving
him a passionate kiss. Tenchi was shocked and pulled away. Ryoko looked at
the ground
and began muttering. "I'm so sorry Tenchi! I should never have done that.
Please forgive
me, I-" But Tenchi gave her no time to finish. He grabbed her face and
pulled it back up
to his, and the two shared another passionate kiss, this one full of more
love than the first.
After a few moments they both drew back for air, each one glowing with love.
Ryoko
smiled sweetly at Tenchi, and he smiled back. They leaned in for another
kiss, when
suddenly there was a loud screech. They dropped their baskets of corn and
bounded up to
the house, only to find Ayeka stomping and yelling and Ryo-oki rolling on
the floor
laughing. "TEEENNNCHIII!!!" Ayeka yelled. "That little rat scared the living
daylights
out of me with her stupid Halloween mask!"

<Tenchi>(as Ryo-Oki)Hey, where's the candy, lady?

She threw the mask into Tenchi's stomach.
"Now, you know that wasn't nice Ryo-oki," Tenchi said, doing his best to
hold back his
urge to laugh. He walked over to Ayeka, who was so upset she was crying.
Tenchi
hugged her, trying to calm her down. "It's alright hun, it's going to be
okay."

<Ryoko>There, there, Atilla.

Ryoko sighed at Ayeka's stupidity and walked up to her room. She closed the
door
behind her, then threw herself onto the bed, gazing skyward. She sighed a
love struck
sigh, feeling as gitty as a schoolgirl.

<Ryoko>I'm feeling like a git? That's not very nice.

Tenchi had kissed her! Something she had only known in her dreams had
finally
happened, and she knew that it meant something true.

<Ryoko>It truly means there's more sex coming up in this fic.
<Tenchi>I'd better gargle or something.

::they exit the theatre::
<Sasami>I'm glad you're at halftime. Now you can try a new thing I've made,
it's a
vegetable that only grows on the moon. Here, have a taste. I'll be back in a
second.
::They all try the strange food as Sasami leaves, and suddenly something
weird happens.
Tenchi notices it first. Dark fur sprouts all over his body and he seems to
be quickly
becoming much smaller. Soon this effects all of them, and as their yells of
surprise turn
into loud mewing, it dawns on the group that they have all been turned into
cabbits::
<Tenchi-Cabbit>*Hey! What happened!*
<Ayeka-Cabbit>*Sasami! Where are you? What have you done to us! Turn us back
into ourselves this instant!*
<Tenchi-Cabbit>*Hey, wait a second. .. this can only be the doing of. . . .*
<All the Cabbits aside from Washu>
WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSHHHHHHHUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!
<Washu-Cabbit>*I don't know, this must be some strange effect of the
combination of
the food Sasami prepared and the revamped water I formulated to boil faster.
Hm, this
could be a significant discovery as to the origin of Cabbits, and why they
can shape shift
as they do.*
<All the others>*WE DON'T CARE! FIX IT*
::Suddenly, a wild-cyan-haired cabbit with yellow eyes walks up to one of
the cabbits and
starts licking its ears.::
<Ayeka-Cabbit>*GROSS!!! RYOKO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME!!!!*
<Ryoko-Cabbit>*Ack!!!!, I thought you were Tenchi!!!!*
::The Ryoko-Cabbit sneezes and coughs up a big hairball::
<All>*EWWWWWW!!!!*
::Sasami comes back, and sees all the cabbits, and does a double take::
<Sasami>Ryo-Oki? Are these your friends?
<Ryo-Oki>Meooowwwwwwwww( sounds like laughter )
<Sasami>Well, they sure are cute. Especially this little one with the pretty
long fur.
::Sasami picks up the Ayeka-cabbit and starts rubbing gently behind its
ears.::
<Ayeka-Cabbit>*SASAMI! Stop tha- oooooooooh!!.*
::Sasami smiles as the purple cabbit purrs and relaxes in her arms.::
<Tenchi-Cabbit>*Enough of this! Washu, how do we change back?*
<Washu-Cabbit>*Well, if we really are Cabbits, then we can shape shift. Just
turn into
human form and we'll figure this out later. Try it.*
::The Tenchi-Cabbit visualizes itself as a human, and suddenly is Tenchi
again, only with
a lot more hair than usual. The others do likewise. Sasami suddenly finds
herself
surrounded by the rest of the group, and is forced to the ground by Ayeka's
sudden
growth in size.::
<Sasami>What the?
(realizes)WWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSHHHHHHHUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!
!!
<Washu>Toss out that water, Sasami, you see, what happened was. .. .
<Tenchi>Not now!!! We have fic sign!!!!
::In the chaos, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Tenchi hustle into the theatre, shedding
lots of cabbit
hair as they go, as are the others.::
<Tenchi>Well, that was something completely different.

* * * *
Ryoko awoke to the birds chirping outside her window. She sighed again, in
hopes that
last night in the cornfield hadn't been a dream. She put on a robe and
slippers and skipped
down the stairs for breakfast. She went in the kitchen, where she saw only
Tenchi sitting
at the table. He was sipping coffee and eating a donut, and even with
frosting on his
upper lip he was charming. She walked in and sat down on the table. "Good
morning,"
Ryoko said, grinning widely.

<Tenchi>(as Homer)Can't talk. Eating. Sex later.

"Good morning, Ryoko," Tenchi said, blushing a little.
"Where is everyone?" asked Ryoko.
"Oh, Ayeka and Mihoshi took Ryo-oki to the vets,

<Tenchi>Yeah, it's "pet a cabbit" day off at the old VFW.

and last I knew Washu was working in her lab," he replied

<Ryoko>Doing the monster mash.
.
"Oh. Tenchi, about last night," Ryoko said, looking at the floor. She knew
what she
wanted to say, but she knew she couldn't have what she wanted. "I think we
should
pretend it never happened."
Tenchi looked stunned. He threw his donut down on the table and stormed
upstairs.
"Tenchi, wait!" Ryoko yelled after him, to no avail. She burst up from her
chair and
followed him into his bedroom. Tenchi was gazing out the window.
"But I can't just forget it, Ryoko. I can't. And I know, deep down, you
can't either. So
why would you want to?" Tenchi said, almost yelling.

<Tenchi>Wow, this is good.
<Ryoko>Clay must have screwed up.
<Ayeka>I don't like it. I can't tell what's worse, that I'm a complete slut
in this fic, or that
I don't even get Tenchi anyway.

"I don't want to Tenchi!

<Ryoko>How do you Tenchi, exactly?
<Tenchi>It's just a jump to the left. . .

I really don't! But I don't want to cause a problem in your life!"
"Ryoko, I love you. How could you be a problem in my life?" Tenchi said,
then looked at
the floor.
Ryoko walked over to him, throwing her robe on the floor in the process. She
kissed him
lightly on the cheek and said, "I love you too, Tenchi."

<Ayeka>Whakka-pakka-whakka-pakka-wha- ow!
<Ryoko>This was kind of sudden, but let's not pass judgment yet. Maybe this
will
actually be a competent sex scene.
<Tenchi>You're just being really, really optimistic.
<Ryoko>Damn, you're right. Still, lets shut up for a second here. . .
<Ayeka>If you'll excuse me for a moment (leaves theatre).
<Ryoko>Figures princess prettypants couldn't take the heat.

Tenchi looked up and smiled. He leaned forward and kissed Ryoko deeply,
feeling the
love from the night before once again. He drew away from her, and the two
stared into
each others eyes for a few moments, then kissed again. Tenchi put his hands
up the back
of Ryoko's nightshirt and caressed her back gently as they kissed. Ryoko
felt this, and
pulled back from their kiss. Tenchi quickly removed his hands. "I'm sorry
Ryoko, if I just
made you feel uncomfortable, I didn't mean to." He said, then looked at the
floor in
shame.
Ryoko smiled, then slowly began to unbutton Tenchi's shirt. He looked up,
confused.
Then he lifted his hands and helped her to unbutton his shirt. Ryoko lifted
it away from
him, and caressed his strong chest softly, kissing his neck and down around
his chest.
She stopped and walked over to the bed. She lay down with her body stretched
out facing
him, tempting him. She looked at him seductively and motioned him over.
Tenchi got up
on top of her, then slowly began to unbutton her nightshirt. Ryoko lay there
limply,
staring deeply into Tenchi's eyes as he proceeded. Finally they were all
unbuttoned, then
Tenchi removed the shirt from around and under her, revealing her soft round
breasts.
Tenchi leaned forward and kissed each one gently, not sucking her nipples
like Ayeka
had always wanted him to do.

<Ryoko>Nipples? Since when does anyone on our show have nipples?
<Tenchi>I guess when they're needed in sexual venting fanfics, they're
there.

He then lay back up vertically on top of her, each one of them not knowing
what to do
next. Ryoko leaned up and kissed Tenchi deeply, and as they kissed she began
undoing
his pants. She pulled them down, and Tenchi stood up on the bed, pulling
away from the
kiss only for a moment, and pulled off his pants, then his boxers, and threw
them on the
floor. Ryoko looked at his naked body up and down, smiling at his erect
penis before her.
She then pulled off her pajama pants and threw them on the floor, leaving
only her
panties. She pulled Tenchi down to her, and kissed him as he put his hands
inside her
underwear, caressing her butt gently. He then proceeded to slip them off
her, then threw
them onto the floor as well. He stared at her bare body, and he knew it was
one of the
most beautiful things he had ever seen. "I love you, Ryoko," he said
smiling.
"I love you, Tenchi," Ryoko said, smiling back. He then slowly began to inch
his hard
member

<Ryoko>Ugh, this was almost going fine, and now there's that m-word again.
<Tenchi>Yeah. And apparently to this person, love equals sex for some
reason, either
that or people suddenly fall in love and then are going at it like cabbits
about 2 minutes
later.
<Ryoko>Well, chances are the author hasn't experienced either sex or love,
so it would
be kind of unfair to expect them to have a clue.

up into her. Ryoko gasped with pleasure as he was fully in her, and then
kissed Tenchi.
Tenchi kissed Ryoko back, then released his manhood into her,

<Tenchi>Run free, penis! Live wild and free in your new home!
<Ryoko>Well, we've descended to the level of the first jaunt into sexuality
in this fic, I
guess I was hoping for too much.

gasping and panting as he came.

<Ryoko>I really hope you have more staying power than this.
<Tenchi>Hey, this is a fic, come on.
<Ryoko>Maybe we'll see about that someday.
<Tenchi>Uh-oh. . .

He pulled his head back from her lips, and kissed her forehead as she
climaxed.

<Ryoko>Yep, it's sure easy to make a woman climax in fanfiction, isn't it?

Never had either of them felt such passion.

<Tenchi>100 yen says neither has the writer.
<Ryoko>I'm not taking that bet!
<Tenchi>It was a figure of speech.

Tenchi and Ayeka had had sex before, but it was always just sex. This was
love.

<Tenchi>For some reason not particularly apparent from reading this.

This was making love. Ryoko yelped quietly as she orgasmed again, then
kissed Tenchi's
neck and chin. A wave off pleasure spread over Tenchi, which dizzied him.
Tenchi was
the happiest he had ever been in his life, and he knew then that he wanted
things to be
like that forever. He wanted to be with Ryoko forever. Ryoko was about to
climax for the
fifth time, when a loud gasp entered the room. That's when the two lovers
realized their
mistake. They had left the door open. Washu stood in the doorway, her jaw
dropped. She
turned around and hurried down the stairs.

<Tenchi>(to fic Ryoko)Oh shit, your mom!!!!
<Ryoko>(pretending to freak)Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod!!!!

"Oh, no," Tenchi said, then quickly pulled himself out of Ryoko. Ryoko
jumped out of
bed and threw her robe on, Tenchi wrapped the bed sheet around himself and
they both
ran downstairs calling out to Washu.
"Washu, please, you can't ever tell a soul what you just saw!" Tenchi
yelled.
"Oh please mom, don't!" Ryoko shouted.
Washu was smiling at them both. "Why would I tell? I'm so happy for you two!
I've been
waiting for you guys to hook up for some time now, and when Tenchi and Ayeka
got
together I thought I was wrong, but I guess even Ayeka couldn't stop my
prediction!"
Tenchi sighed. "So you won't tell?"
"Of course not! I'm rooting for you guys all the way!"

<Tenchi>(as Washulings)Rah rah rah! Go Tenchi, go! Make Ryoko "Oh!"

Ryoko smiled. "Thanks mom," she said. She looked at Tenchi sweetly, then
walked up to
her room.
"Well, my dear boy, it looks like you're in a bit of a spot. You've got two
women who
love you, so who are you going to choose?" Washu said.
"I don't know," Tenchi said, then sighed sadly. "I think I would rather be
with Ryoko, but
my family and everyone else thinks I should be with Ayeka."
"Hmm…" Washu said, thinking to herself.
Just then Ayeka, Mihoshi, and Ryo-oki walked in the door. "Hey my little
sugar baby,"
Ayeka said, and kissed Tenchi on the cheek. "What are you doing wrapped up
in only
that bed sheet?"
"Well, I..." Tenchi stuttered.
"He was just about to get in the shower when I yelled for him to help me
with
something," Washu interrupted. Tenchi smiled and whispered thank you.
"Oh. Well, Ryo-oki's vet appointment went well, but apparently she's almost
reached
sexual maturity so we have to go back and get her spayed," Ayeka replied,
and Ryo-oki
made a disgusted look.

<Tenchi>I'll sharpen up the spoons, you get the napkins.
<Ryoko>Ok.

"Well, I'm going to go get in the shower. See you guys later," Tenchi said,
then went
upstairs.
* * * *
Everyone laughed at the movie. "This is such a funny film!" Washu said,
between laughs,
then looked around. She saw Tenchi, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Ryo-oki. "Hey, does
anyone
know where Ayeka went?"
"She went upstairs like ten minutes ago and hasn't come back down," Mihoshi
said. "You
better go get her, Tenchi."
"Alright," he said, then slowly got up and climbed up the stairs. He walked
to Ayeka's
room, and opened the door. Ayeka was lying completely naked on the bed; her
legs open
to him, revealing her womanhood.
" It's about time you came looking for me, handsome," she said, then purred.
"Come over
and see me."
Tenchi shut the door behind him and walked silently over to the bed. He sat
down beside
Ayeka, not looking her directly in the eye. She sat up on her knees and
began to unzip
Tenchi's pants. He sat there, not saying anything, barely even moving, as
she pulled down
his boxers and pulled out his penis. She began to stick it inside her,
moaning and
groaning the way she always did. Tenchi just tried to push it out of his
mind, but he kept
thinking about Ryoko. With her perfect face, perfect legs, perfect breasts,
and perfect
mind. Finally he couldn't take it anymore. He yanked himself out of Ayeka
and jumped
off of the bed. Ayeka fell to the floor. "Tenchi! What did you do that for?"
she yelled.
"Don't you love me?"
Tenchi stared at her, without a word.
"Well?" Ayeka repeated. "Do you love me Tenchi?" she stood up and walked
over to the
bed. She lay down before him, still naked. "If you love me, come here and
have sex with
me, like you always do. Please, come here."
Tenchi looked at the ground. He pulled his pants up onto him again, then
headed for the
door. "Tenchi!" Ayeka screamed.
Tenchi turned around to see her horrified expression. "No Ayeka, I don't
love you," he
said quietly, then left the room, hearing Ayeka bawling and screaming as he
went down
the stairs.

<Ryoko>Talk about dumped.
<Tenchi>I guess that was inevitable. But really, why would I have gotten
involved with
Ayeka physically if I wasn't sure were my feelings were?
<Ryoko>You're male.
<Tenchi>Oh, right. I keep forgetting that.. . .

He went back into the TV room. "Where's Ryoko?" he asked.
"Oh, she went to bed a few minutes ago. Now be quiet, we're trying to hear
the movie!"
Mihoshi said, not moving her eyes from the screen. Washu looked up Tenchi
with
hopeful eyes, and Tenchi smiled at her and nodded. Washu chuckled to herself
and
moved her eyes back to the movie. Tenchi went up to bed, for once sleeping
peacefully.
* * * *
The next morning Tenchi awoke, and quietly slipped into the bathroom. He had
no idea
what he was going to say to Ryoko or Ayeka that day, so to calm himself he
slipped off
his clothes and got into a soothing warm shower. As he scrubbed himself he
didn't hear
the bathroom door open and close. He turned around to see Ryoko's smiling
face looking
up at him. She was wearing her nightdress, but to Tenchi she still looked
beautiful.

<Tenchi>Yeah, even though she's not naked and stuff. I mean, most people
become butt
ugly when they put clothes on.
<Ryoko>God, whoever wrote this really needs to discover masturbation.

"Ryoko, I-" Tenchi began to say, but Ryoko interrupted him.
"Ayeka left this morning. She said she was being called away by her family,
but I think I
know the real reason why she left."

<Tenchi>That reminds me, where the hell was Sasami in this fic? She isn't
even
mentioned! Do a word search if you don't believe me!
<Ryoko>I think the writer forgot.
<Tenchi>I guess I should be somewhat relieved, considering.
<Ryoko>I guess we all should be. Including Sasami.

Tenchi smiled. "Yeah, I think I know too," he said, then leaned forward and
kissed
Ryoko. "So she left for good?"
"Well, that's what she said. Her room's empty," Ryoko answered, then kissed
Tenchi
back.
"So I'm free to love you for as long and as freely as I want?" Tenchi asked,
smiling.
"Tenchi, you could do that even if Ayeka WAS here," Ryoko responded, then
smiled
back.
"Ryoko… This may seem too soon, but I am completely serious," Tenchi said,
then
pulled Ryoko up against him in the shower. Ryoko giggled, as her nightdress
got wet.
"Will you mar

<Tenchi>-inate this steak for me?
<Ryoko>Ho, ho.
<Tenchi>Ha, ha.
<Ryoko>Hee, hee.

ry me?"
Ryoko was stunned. She had never even dreamed this could happen. "Yes I
will, Tenchi.
I would be honored," she replied, then Tenchi kissed her deeply. "I love
you, Tenchi."
"I love you too, Ryoko," Tenchi replied. He then unbuttoned her night dress
and slipped
it off. Ryoko took off her panties, then quickly pulled Tenchi's moist penis
up inside her.

<Tenchi>Let's get married. "Ok" Let's have sex for no reason even though we
just did
anyway. "Ok"
<Ryoko>This has as much to do with real life as a pop tart has to do with
food.

She wrapped herself around him, as if they were hugging, and kissed Tenchi's
neck.
Tenchi moaned with pleasure and happiness, because he knew he was free to do
this
forever. Free to make love to Ryoko without worry. Free to marry Ryoko
without worry.
Free to start a family with Ryoko without worry. Free to love Ryoko without
worry. And
he did. He loved her, and he knew he always would. He always would.

<Tenchi>What was the forbidden love in this anyway? I mean, the Ayeka incest
thing is
too easy, and I apparently didn't love her anyway in this.
<Ryoko>Beats me, but I'm sure of this- people who have probably never been
in a real
relationship should be forbidden from writing romance fics that try to be
profound and
passionate and instead turn out to be as clueless as a guy who goes to a
baseball game on
bat day with a piñata on his head.

Stinger clip: Ayeka stood up, then sat down in Tenchi's lap with her legs
wrapped around
his waist. She undid his belt, then slowly unzipped his fly, revealing his
hard member.
