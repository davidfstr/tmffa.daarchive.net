No need for a passive Tenchi.



A man is standing in the middle of a spotlight.  When you look closely, you 
notice it's tenchi. Only a few things are different : He's wearing a black 
suit with a long crimson cloak, in his hand is a chainsaw made out of pure 
light and there's a demented look on his face.  You walk closer to ask him 
what he's doing here ( and where "here" is actually ) but he notices you 
first.

Tenchi: Ahhhh. Welcome.
You: huuu… hi.
Tebchi:  You're a fortunate man, you are about to witness a great moment in 
the historie of animation.
You : And what would that be Tenchi san?
Tenchi : As of today, I SHALL NO LONGER BE A PASSIVE CHARACTER IN MY OWN 
SERIES!!!!!
You : Yhea right.
Tenchi : You don't seem to believe me. Allow me to demonstrate.

Tenchi then slices a hole in the space time continuum with his light hawk 
chainsaw
( tm )  and jumps in it.  He reappears in the Masaki kitchen as Ryoko, Aeka 
and Washu are discussing how to save him from what's her name, the bad guy 
from tenchi forever.

Tenchi : Well, I can't disturb them, however the viewers can see me in the 
background…..

He then notices Ryo-oh-kii   happily munching on a carrot. He grins.  As the 
ladies talk on the screen, Tenchi can be seen in the background hacking the 
poor cabbit to a bloody mass with an axe. Each time he strikes, a geiser of 
blood hits the ceiling.  When the talk scene is over, he goes trough his 
portal again.

Tenchi : Well, how's that?
You : Well, you were still pretty much unimportant. The viewers were 
listening to the girls. Not watching you…..
Tenchi : Allright. You want me to do better, I'LL DO BETTER!!!

He warps again.


Tenchi reappears  in the dimention of What's her name, you know, the bad guy 
from Tenchi forever.

Tenchi: So you want me to do something people will notice eh?

Tenchi then starts to hack down people randomly. Soon, all the city is 
painted in red, Tenchi's covered in blood, and there isn't anyone left to 
kill. Tenchi grins and phases back. He looks at you smiling.

Tenchi: Well how's that? Now the viewers will HAVE to see my work!
You: Actually, what's her name is just gonna repair it all with her powers. 
No one will notice.
Now Tenchi seems peeved. But I mean PEEVED! He glares at you for a moment, 
then smiles.

Tenchi: So what you're saying. Is that I have to do something so grand that 
no one can miss it, and it has to be something no cosmic entity can undo 
correct?
You: Yep.
Tenchi : All right, you just watch.

Tenchi warps one more time, and appears outside the Masaki house. He then 
walks right trough the door. Aeka sees him first.

Aeka: Lord Tenchi! You are safe, I was so worried!

Without a word, he stabs her in the gut, and pulls upward, slicing her in 
half. What's left of her falls to the ground spraying blood everywhere.

Hearing that tenchi was back, Ryoko flies into the room.

Ryoko: Welcome back Ten….chi…

Before she has time react, he slices her head off, empties it, and uses it 
as a flower pot. Tenchi grins and looks at you.

Tenchi: Two down, five to go.

He knocks on washu's lab door, and pulls a 45 magnum out of nowhere. The 
moment she opens the door, he blasts her head off.

Tenchi: Well that was easy
You: Knowing Washu, she probably has four dozens clones of herself waiting.
Tenchi: Good! All the more fun for me.

>From the kitchen Sasami's voice can be heard

Sasami: Tenchi! Is that you? Are you ok?

She runs out of the kitchen crying

Sasami: Oh Tenchi! I was so worried, you were gone and I can't find 
Ryo-Ohkii!

Tenchi is about to blast her to a million pieces when you hold him back. He 
glares at you then smiles.

Tenchi: So you want the cute little girl to live. All right! I'm doing all 
this for you anyway.

He then turns back muttering under his breath.

Tenchi: pedophile.

You smile sheepishly.

Tenchi: I think I saw her in the carrot patch.
Sasami: Thanks Tenchi!

She runs out of the house, right passed her sister's decapitated corpse, 
without giving it a tough. Meanwhile, Tenchi is on the phone, after a while, 
he hangs up.

You: Who were you talking to?
Tenchi: Just the galaxy police, I used my status as prince of Juraï to make 
sure Kiyone never gets any other partner than Mihoshi.
You: Dude that's just plain evil.
Tenchi: I know, They should learn the news any moment now.

>From upstairs, a gun can be heard going off.

Mihoshi: Kiyone! NOOOOOOOO!

Another gun shot can be heard.

Tenchi: You see, unable to live with being stuck with Mihoshi forever, 
Kiyone killed herself. Unable to live without Kiyone, Mihoshi blew her head 
off too.
You: Yhea, but you weren't the direct cause of there deaths, thus it was 
still a passive action.

Tenchi: SREW YOU! I can be a sneaky bastard too if I want to!
Yosho: What's going on here?!

Yosho stands in the doorway, his boken in hand, staring at the carnage.

You: You know, there's no way you'll beat him.
Tenchi: Just watch. Grampa look! IT'S A FLYING BEAVER!!!!
Yosho: ( turns around ) WHERE?!?!

Tenchi stabs him in the back. Yosho falls down coughing blood.

You: Well I'll be…….
Tenchi: And now for the last act of non passiveness! THE DESTRUCTION OF 
JURAÏ!!!!!

The next thing you know, you've been warped to Juraï and Tenchi is standing 
atop a HUGE pile of corpses, holding azusa's head.

Tenchi: There! I did it! No one can stop me now!
You: Actually, by doing all this you became a "bad guy" ( insert dr Evil's 
finger thing here). Thus you can no longer have your show. Some new goody 
two shoes should be here any moment to replace you.
Tenchi: WA WHAT!?! You can't be serious!?
You: I am.
Tenchi: Bring it on then! I have the light hawk wings AND I'M WILLING TO USE 
THEM! NO ONE CAN STOP ME!HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You: That's what all bad guys say just before they get killed.

As if on cue, you can hear.

New hero: PREPARE TO DIE EVIL DOER! FUJISAWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
KIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!

>From the bottom of the piles, you can see Tenchi's head being kicked off.


THE HAPPY END ^_^
