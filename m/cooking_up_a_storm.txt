Cooking Up a Storm!

6 am, The Masaki house.

        She walks into the house with no problems on her mind.  Remembering
that Tenchi said she was always welcome, Mihoshi steps into the house.
Sitting on the couch, she waits for everyone to wake up.

        But, her stomach requests attention since she forgot to eat breakfast.
Walking into the kitchen, she looks for something to eat.

==========

        Misa has only been up for two minutes when she hears something
downstairs.  Quickly dressing, she heads downstairs.  Walking down the
stairs, she can hear somebody chopping in the kitchen.  Walking into
said room, "Mihoshi?  What are you doing?"

        "Good morning, Misa.  You wanted to go into town, so I came over."

        "That's not what I meant.  What are you doing NOW?"

        Looking at the utensils ahead of her, "cooking breakfast?"

        "You can cook?  I never knew."

        "Nobody asked."

        Misa face faults, "oh, I see.  Why are you here at 6 am anyways?  I
wasn't going into town until this afternoon."

        "I just wanted to get here a little early."

        Misa sits at the table, "it's too early for this.  Mihoshi, I said I
was going to meet you at your apartment."

        Thinking back, "oops.  I forgot."

        In response, Misa hits her forehead on the table.

        Sasami, on this rare occasion, is sleeping soundly.  This morning, her
dreams are as peaceful as the outdoor weather.  Waking up, she can smell
bacon downstairs.  "Misa must be up." she says to herself.  Looking at
the clock, she sees its only ten after six.  "She's up early this
morning."

        After dressing, she heads downstairs.  Walking into the living room,
she can see Misa sitting at the kitchen table.  "If she's there, who's
cooking?"  <I hope it's not Ayeka or Ryoko.>

        But, as she walks in, "Mihoshi?  What are you doing?"

        "Cooking breakfast," she responds.

        "I didn't know you could cook," Sasami says.

        "You never asked."

        Struck by this comment, she sits down with Misa.  "Maybe I should
have."

        Misa, resting her head on her folded arms, "WE should have, you mean."

        "I'm really sorry," Mihoshi says.  "I didn't mean to cause any
trouble."

        "It's okay, Mihoshi," Sasami responds.

7:00

        Mihoshi sets down the meal on the table just as Ayeka enters the
kitchen.  "Good Morning, Sasami, Misa."  Looking at the third,
"Mihoshi?"

        "Misa and I are going into town, so I came over."

        Sitting down, "I see breakfast is already prepared.  It looks
delicious, Sasami."

        "Sorry, Ayeka.  I wasn't involved."

        "Misa?"

        "Don't look at me."

        <Oh, no.  Not> "Mihoshi?"

        "Yes?"

        "Did you cook this?"

        Nodding, "is there something wrong?"

        "No, nothing."  <Not yet, anyway.>

        Ryoko awakens from her sake induced slumber to see breakfast already on
the table.  "This looks great, Sasami!"

        Sasami just shakes her head.

        "Misa?"

        "Nope."

        Ryoko looks at Ayeka, "don't tell me you CAN cook?"

        "I'm just as shocked as you are."

        Ryoko looks at the new arrival, "Mihoshi?  Did you do this?"

        "Did I do something wrong?"

        "Nothing, yet."  <Now, I'm worried.>

        Washu walks in to see the scene, and sits down.  "Looks great, Sasami.
I can't wait to try it."

        "I didn't cook this morning."

        "Misa?"

        Misa shakes her head, "I had no part in this."

        Washu looks at Ayeka and Ryoko, almost fearful.  "You didn't.  Did
you?"

        "No." they say in unison.

        "Then who cooked?"

        "Miss Washu?  I cooked this."

        "Like I said, I wonder who cooked?"

        "I can cook just fine!" Mihoshi shouts.  "Why doesn't anyone believe
me?"

        "Does the term 'destroyer' mean anything to you?" Washu asks.

        Tenchi and his grandfather walk into the kitchen as the discussion
takes place.  "I see that breakfast is ready," Tenchi says.  "And who do
I owe for such a fine meal?"

        Everyone, even Katsuhito, point at Mihoshi.

        Tenchi turns white at the thought.  <I'm doomed.>

        With everyone at the table, the meal begins.  And to everyone's
astonishment, it is quite a fine meal.

        "Why didn't you say you could cook?" Tenchi asks.

        Misa looks at Tenchi, guiltily, "some of us forgot to ask, right
Sasami?"

        "Right."

        And, as the day rolls on, that thought is on everyone's mind.
