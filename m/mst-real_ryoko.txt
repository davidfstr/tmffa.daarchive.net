Clayton: (rips off the wigs) Spike? Ryo-oki? What the hell are you doing 
here?
Ryo-oki: (gestures wildly) Meow, myah meow wow, myah
Spike: (Lays back) We were paid a lot of money
Ryoko: (glares at them) And they couldn't let us in on the plan?
Washu: They shall pay
Tenchi: Oh, calm down. It could be worse.
Clayton: Damn the fic's starting. I'll have to make due. But someone will 
pay for this. Washu, get Ryo-oki a translator and censore it
Ryo-oki: Why the **** did you put a ******* censore on this ***** **** piece 
of ****?



      Hello! My name is Megumi,

All: Hi Megumi!

and this is my first Tenchi fanfiction, so
go easy on me.

Spike: Hell no!

It's just that I have an obsession with sweet little Tenchi,

Tenchi: (Smacks his forehead) Not another one!
Ryoko: (Hugs him) Mine mine mine!

probably because he looks like the guy I'm in love with. Aww, my Tenchi!
Anyway, I hope you like my story!
        --Megumi

                        The Real Ryoko

Clayton: As opposed to the fake Ryoko that shows up at the mall when the 
artists visit
Tenchi: (Holding a copy of Animerica) Good costumes

        Tenchi Masaki sat on one of the stepping stones by the
tree-slash-rooted
spaceship Funaho, watching the sun rise.

Tenchi: Ah, my eyes! Why oh why did they make me stare at the sun? The pain! 
(Claws his face)

He was a fairly attractive
teenager,

Spike: (Snicker)

with black hair and soft brown eyes,

Ryo-oki: (Poke's Tenchi in the eye) Hmm, well done. Bet that'd taste good 
with carrots
Ryoko: What is it with you and carrots
Ryo-oki: I like to **** with them and shove them into my mouth and *** okay? 
Now why don't you shut up before I ****** you and your mother too
Washu: Hey leave me outta this

but his personality was considered much
more charming than his looks.

Tenchi: I thought this girl had a crush on me. What gives?

   Tenchi turned in surprise as he heard a noise behind him.

Spike: Bet you it's another girl
Clayton: You're on!

He looked
up to see
a pretty young girl with dark purple hair walking across the stepping stones
toward him.

Clayton: (grumbles and pays up) I like it better when Gene is here. He 
always loses

He smiled and waved a greeting.
        "Good morning, Lady Ayeka," he called. "Did you sleep well?"
        The first princess of the planet Jurai's royal family shook her
head. "How
could I be expected to sleep with that monster-woman Ryoko and my own little
sister up all night playing blackjack? It's such a disgraceful game!"

Ryoko: We took Aeka for thirty bucks in the first five minutes

        The boy laughed. "Don't worry about Sasami. She has fun with Ryoko.

Spike: Ah, strip poker
Ryoko: (Hits him) Pervert!

Besides,
your sister seems to make Ryoko a better person."
        "Maybe," sighed Ayeka. "So... What are you doing out here so early,
Lord
Tenchi?"

Clayton: Well I was on the way to the shrine and decided to take a leak on 
the sacred tree
Ryoko: Tenchi, your fly
Tenchi: (Zips up) Sorry princess

        Tenchi winced at the usage of the proper title. He also had Juraian
blood in
him, but it didn't make him a prince, in his opinion. "Well, actually," he
replied, trying to forget about Ayeka's view of how he should be, "I
couldn't
sleep either. Ryoko and Sasami DO get pretty noisy."

Spike: (Laughs)
Clayton: (Snicker)
Others: (glare at them)

        Ayeka chuckled slightly and sat down beside him. The morning sunrise
was
peaceful until Tenchi and Ayeka were scared half out of their wits to see a
small spaceship,

Tenchi: (bangs his head on the wall)
Washu: We need a sign or something!
Ryoko: Why do they all land at our house? I mean the planet is huge and 
there are six billion other people
Clayton: Don't knock it. Just be glad you aren't on Pokemon
Washu: Hmm, nurse Washu and officer Ryoko...
Ryoko: (snicker) Kiyone would love that

blaring alarms, heading right toward them.
        Ayeka shrieked and climbed onto Tenchi's back.

Tenchi: Ah, alien face huggers!
Washu: Now the little Juraians will burst from your chest

The boy chose to
ignore the
fact that the princess was inadvertently strangling him and ran across the
stepping stones as fast as he was capable. With an enormous splash, the
spaceship crash-landed into the lake surrounding the tree Funaho.

Spike: Is it just me or is the tree's name Funaho?

        Tenchi eased the shaking princess off his back.

Clayton: Well now that we're unpacked let's get the tent set up

He walked carefully
to the
downed ship and called, "Hello? Are you hurt?"

Washu: You know I'd think spaceships from advanced cultures could do better 
than crashing in the damn lake every time.
Ryo-oki: Tell me about it. That **** lake is from me crashing in the first 
place, then there's Funaho, Aeka's ship, Sasami's ship, Mihoshi's ship...

    With much difficulty, the rear door of the spaceship opened. An
unbelievably
attractive young man climbed out.

Tenchi: Woo hoo! Decoys!
Spike: Unless he likes you too

He had dark blue hair with aqua-colored
bangs and bronze eyes.

Ryoko: Damn it! It's another Mayuka clone

"I'm okay, but I think my ship's going down!"
        Tenchi swam over to the young man and grabbed his arm. Together they
managed
to make it back to Funaho just as the spacecraft disappeared completely
under
the surface.

Tenchi: (Stands on the chair and spreads his arms) I'm king of the world
Ryoko: Galaxy actually
Others: (playing instruments as the ship sinks while Spike sings 'Under the 
sea').

The two young men, literally soaked, watched it sink. "Oh,
great,
all my work is in there!"

Washu: (As his teacher) Not the old 'I crashed my ship into the lake outside 
Tenchi's house' excuse again! That's the third time this week

He groaned in dispair and turned to Tenchi.
"Sorry,
I should have thanked you for saving me. I'm not much of a swimmer." He held
out his hand. "My name is Toshiro."
        Tenchi shook his hand, his teeth chattering. "I'm Tenchi Masaki, and
the girl
over there is Ayeka."
        Toshiro smiled and skipped across the stones to meet the princess.

Spike: Oh yeah, he's really masculine

"Nice to
meet you, Miss Ayeka," he said, kissing her hand.
        The girl blushed and managed to say, "The pleasure is mine, sir!"

Clayton: Wow, he is good if she... (Stops before finishing)
Tenchi: If she what?
Ryo-oki: If she had an ******* and was already willing to **** him
Clayton: You were so much cuter when you couldn't talk

        The young man winked. "Call me Toshiro."
        Tenchi slogged over to Ayeka and Toshiro. "We're really sorry about
your
ship, Toshiro. What did you say was in there?"
        "My work," Toshiro said. "I'm an astrobiologist. I study unusual
lifeforms

Ryoko: In that case you'll fit right in

in
space." He gestured to the area where his ship had been. "My entire LIFE was
in that ship, and as you can see, it's lost now."

Spike: Boardgames are essential for space travel as is cereal

       "Ah, don't worry," said Tenchi cheerfully. "I'm sure we can come
back later
and salvage your work. But right now, we need to get us both to my house
before we freeze to death!"

Clayton: I'll bet that some strange disease he had in there will now infect 
the lake
Washu: Probably, but I'll find a cure

        "Of course," Said Toshiro, laughing. He offered his arm to Ayeka.
"Shall
we?"
        Ayeka smiled and turned red again. She slipped her arm into his and
they
began walking.
        Tenchi raised an eyebrow. *What a ladies' man,* he thought, and ran
to catch
up with them.

All: (laugh their asses off)
Tenchi: Not funny.
Clayton: Yes it is!


        Ryoko slammed her fist against the living room table. "Forget it,
Washu,
you're not going to make me jealous of that brat Ayeka!"

Washu: Like I need to
Ryoko: That's been over for years (Hugs Tenchi tight)
Tenchi: (chokes)

      The red haired scientific genius ignored the space pirate's outburst
and
calmly pulled out a scanning instrument. "Actually, Ryoko, by my readings,
your blood pressure is above normal and you are visibly redder than usual.
Yep, I'd say you were jealous, Sweetpea!"

Washu: (As Popey) Ah me littskle Sweatpea is jealouske
Ryoko: (As Popey) I yam what I yam

        "Don't call me that, MOM," Ryoko said threateningly.
        Sasami, the second princess of Jurai and Ayeka's younger sister,
took the
enraged young woman's hand to restrain her. "Don't be mad, Ryoko! Just
because
Tenchi and my sister have been out a long time, it doesn't mean anything
happened. Besides, I don't think Tenchi even has a crush on Ayeka!"

Ryo-oki: I always said she was the smartest one there
Washu: Excuse me?
Ryo-oki: You heard me you little *****. Now go back to your lab and build 
something to **** yourself with

        Ryoko sat down, shocked. "You really think so, Sasami?"
        Sasami looked at the cyan-haired pirate sheepishly. "I didn't want
to get
your hopes up at first, but now I know Tenchi doesn't have any feelings for
her."

Tenchi: Well I like her like an aunt
Spike: Trust me, the ones with purple hair are nothing but trouble

        "There's much wisdom in childhood," Washu broke in. "I have many
statistics
on this subject, and I have also concluded that the boy considers Lady Ayeka
to be no more than a friend."

Washu: (Plugs in a tape)
Washu on the screen interviewing people: Who do you think get's Tenchi?
People on the street: Ryoko. Ryoko. Mihoshi. Washu. Ryoko. Sasami. Ryoko. 
Ryo-oki.

        Ryoko's shocked face turned into a smile, and then a grin.
"WOOOOO-HOOOOOO,
all right!" She flew in circles around the living room.

Tenchi: Watch out for the bug zapper!
Ryoko: (Is zapped) Ooo, it tickles

"I knew it, I KNEW
it!
Tenchi would never fall for a snob like Ayeka!" Still floating, she said to
Sasami, "No offense, Sasami, dear."
        The pigtailed young girl laughed at Ryoko's aerial display while
Washu poured
herself a cup of tea.

Washu: (Slips some vodka into her tea)

        Suddenly the pirate stopped. "Hey, wait a minute, Washu." She
floated down
onto the couch. "If you've conducted so many studies, you must know who
Tenchi
REALLY loves, right?"
        The short redhead sipped her tea. "I do," she replied.
        Ryoko gasped. "Tell me, who is it?"
        "I think it's better off that you didn't know. Besides, for all you
know, he
could be in love with me!"

Ryoko and Tenchi: (fall to the floor laughing)
Washu: (Glares at them) Time for some experiments when we get home

        Ryoko narrowed her golden eyes. "If he is..."
        The back door slid open and a drenched Tenchi walked inside,
followed by the
Jurai princess and a gorgeous blue-haired young man, who was also soaked.

Spike: Aeka you couldn't control yourself for five minutes?
Ryo-oki: It has been almost a thousand years

        Ryoko ran over to Tenchi. "Tenchi, darling, what happened? You're
absolutely-- whoa! Who's your friend?!"
        Toshiro grinned. "My name's Toshiro, and my ship crashed near your
house.
Your friend Tenchi helped me out. He's a stand-up guy."

Ryoko: (Sits in Tenchi's lap)

    "Yeah, yeah, good for Tenchi," said Ryoko. "My name is Ryoko, and
over there
are Washu and Sasami."
        "Pleased to meet all of you," said Toshiro. He whispered to Tenchi,
"Jeez, man, how'd you get all these gorgeous women?"
        Tenchi sighed. "You don't know how complicated the story is."
        Ryoko continued, "Our other residents are not here at the moment.
Tenchi's
father Nobuyuki is at work, and his grandfather Katsuhito is at the Masaki
shrine. Galaxy Police officers Kiyone and Mihoshi went to town to buy
groceries. But who cares about them?" she said, batting her eyelashes. "Tell
me about yourself!"

Clayton: So eighteen years of being in love with a boy means nothing when a 
cute guy comes along?

        Every one of the girls flocked around the suave astrobiologist. Even
Washu,
who didn't normally go insane over a guy, was under a male-induced spell.

Washu: Well it's not like I've had a lot to choose from you know. The skinny 
kid, the pervert, or the withered old guy

Tenchi rolled his eyes and thought, *Why are they all flirting with him?

Spike: To give you a break

Even
Ryoko is, and she's practically in love with me.*

All: Practically?!?

He couldn't believe it,
but
he was jealous of Toshiro. Maybe it was because he was so charming, or it
was
the fact that all the girls were crazy about him, but Tenchi Masaki, who was
normally so compassionate, kind, and tolerant, already couldn't stand the
guy.


        That night at dinner, Toshiro was given the privilege of meeting all
the
members of the Masaki household. He was completely blown away by the
staggering number of women that resided there.

Ryo-oki: You know most scientists don't consider six a stagering number

He enjoyed being with every
one
of them,

Spike: Already? Took Tenchi two years

even the ditzy blonde police officer, Mihoshi.

Ryo-oki: Who fell for the first guy she saw when she landed

He thought Sasami
was
a cute, bright little kid, but his attention was mostly on that devilishly
beautiful space pirate, Ryoko.

Ryoko: Now who does the author seem to have a crush on?

He had a feeling she was interested in him as
well. All in all, it was turning out to be a great night for him.
        Tenchi was in hell.

All: (sing) -O opperator give me number 9 and if you disconect me I'll chop 
off your behind...

        Ryoko and the other girls were hanging on Toshiro's every word, and
he was
just drinking it in. He had established an instant bond with Tenchi's father
and grandfather, and even Ryoko's rabbitlike pet Ryo-Ohki was attached to
him.

Spike: Hey, get off his leg
Ryo-oki: What do you expect? I haven't seen Ken-oki in months

        What a jerk.
        "So," Ryoko cooed, "Tell us, Toshiro, what kind of lifeforms do you
study in
space?"
        "Well, there is an innumerable variety of species and subspecies
just in this
galaxy alone," said Toshiro.

Washu: I know

"But I've never seen a creature quite like you,
Ryo-Ohki!"
        The little furball meowed in delight and jumped onto Toshiro's
shoulder,
where she nuzzled his cheek.

Ryo-oki: Nuzzle... yeah that's what I'm doing.

Everyone laughed, except for Tenchi.
        "Ryo-Ohki is quite a unique animal," said Kiyone, self-consciously
brushing a
blue strand of hair from her face.

Spike: I seem to remember her hair being green
Ryoko: And we have enough blue hair on the show

"She can actually turn into a spaceship
that Ryoko can control telepathically."
        "This woman never ceases to amaze me," said Toshiro, gesturing to
Ryoko. She
blushed madly.
        Tenchi felt sick. "If you'll excuse me, I have a headache.

Ryoko: That never worked with me
Tenchi: Speaking of which thanks for treating my dehydration Washu
Washu: Any time

I'm going
to sit
outside for a while." He stood and walked to the back door.
        Ayeka looked concerned. "But Lord Tenchi, you hardly touched your
dinner."

Clayton: That's cause Sasami's cooking stinks

        "That's okay, I'm not really hungry," he replied, walking out the
door. "But
the food was great, Sasami."
        "Feel better, Tenchi," called Toshiro.
        Tenchi closed the door without responding.
        "Tenchi must really be sick," said Sasami worriedly. "I hope he'll
be okay."

Tenchi: If I die I'll just be resurected again

        Washu shrugged. "Oh, well. Tenchi rarely gets sick, but when he
does, he
doesn't like company."
        Ryoko held her gaze on the door Tenchi had left through. *I know
Tenchi's not
sick,* she thought to herself. *So what's wrong?*

Spike: (As Tenchi) Do you ever feel less than fresh?

        Tenchi sat on the steps of the Masaki shrine. He couldn't understand
why he
disliked Toshiro so much. He was kind, funny, and obviously smart, so why
did
he make Tenchi want to gag?
        The more the young man thought about it, the more he realized why he
couldn't
stand Toshiro. Ryoko liked him so much. Every time they would flirt, Tenchi
would get physically sick.

Ryoko: Aw, that's so cute

This fact made him ponder over the space pirate
more than the astrobiologist. He finally decided that the problem wasn't
Toshiro; it was Ryoko.

Spike: There you go, blaming everyone but yourself

        Ryoko acted like a rogue most of the time, but Tenchi knew she was
hiding the
real Ryoko,

Ryo-oki: Oh how clever. They worked in the title

the Ryoko behind the space pirate.

Clayton: (As the Wizard of Oz) Pay no attention to the woman behind the 
pirate! I'm auditioning for Power Rangers

When she wasn't robbing
banks,

Ryoko: Just the one time!

destroying cities,

Ryoko: That wasn't my fault

or bickering with Ayeka,

Ryoko: I'll give you that one

she was a funny, pleasant
person,
and she was great with Sasami. Tenchi suspected that the reason she acted
the
way she did was because she had never experienced the love of family and
friends.

Washu: (As Psychologist) Now tell me about your mother
Ryoko: Well I was kidnapped before I was born...

Now that she had both, her harsh exterior was wearing off.

Clayton: Hey, she's made of chocolate!
Washu: I am such a genius!

     Tenchi sighed and closed his eyes. He knew she loved him, for she
showed it
quite frequently. He cared for her deeply as well, and he could very well
love
her, if only she would drop the space pirate facade. He was convinced that
the
Ryoko deep inside was kind and gentle.

Ryoko: That's right. Inside I'm a dainty flower and I'll beat the crap out 
of anyone who says otherwise!

He just needed to get her to show it,
and he knew that with Toshiro around, that wouldn't be easy.
        "Are you all right, Tenchi?" came a voice that startled the boy. He
opened
his eyes to see Sasami, who had her pigtails up in buns and was clutching
Ryo-Ohki.

Ryo-oki: (As Sasami as Lea) Help me Obi-wan

        Tenchi smiled. *She's such a sweetheart,* he thought. "What are you
doing out
here so late, Sasami?" he gently chided. "It's past your bedtime."

Spike: She's hundreds of years old. Let her stay up a few minutes

        "I know," she replied, plopping down next to him on the steps of the
shrine.
"But Ryoko--" (Tenchi's heart jumped)

Tenchi: (clutches his chest)
Washu: (Gives him some asprin)

"--was saying that she didn't think
you
were sick, so I was worried about you."
        Tenchi took Ryo-Ohki into his arms and scratched her ears. "You know
me too
well, Sasami."
        The girl studied his features and finally said, "You don't like
Toshiro, do
you?"
        Tenchi wasn't expecting that remark. "What makes you say that?"

Clayton: (reads aloud) In fact he would become physicaly ill...

        "Well, whenever he talks to Ryoko, you look really angry." Sasami
gave him a
look that was too old for a girl her age. "And I know how much you like
Ryoko."
        The boy was shocked. *One ton of bricks after another today,* he
thought.
"You can tell?!" He asked the girl, bewildered.

All: Duh!

      Sasami giggled at Tenchi's reaction. "Yeah, I can tell you don't
have any
feelings for my sister, even though she's crazy

Ryoko: Yup

about you. And plus by
seeing
your face every time someone says Ryoko's name, like RIGHT NOW, I can tell
how
you feel about her."
        Ryo-Ohki mewed in agreement.

Ryo-oki: (thinks) Well I suppose you could do it if you had something to 
lean your legs on... (draws a diagram)
Tenchi: (glances over and gets a nosebleed)

        "Wow," said Tenchi softly. "If you can tell, the others must know."
        Sasami smiled cheerfully. "No, nobody else knows besides me and
Ryo-Ohki!"
        Tenchi smiled back and put his arm around the young girl. He knew
his secret
was safe with Sasami.

Ryo-oki: I on the otherhand am writing a book

        Sasami rested her head on Tenchi's shoulder and sighed dreamily. *If
only
Tenchi didn't love Ryoko,* she thought. *He's such a sweetheart.*

Clayton: That's just plain creepy

        The next morning Toshiro woke up to a high-pitched scream.
        "Where is Sasami?!!" he heard the Juraian princess shriek. "She  and
Tenchi
haven't come back home since last night!"

Washu: After all that Sasami get's him?

        Toshiro stumbled downstairs and collided into Mihoshi. "Sorry, Mr.
Toshiro,
it's just that Tenchi and Sasami are missing!"
        "Tenchi's missing??!" Ryoko shouted, floating down the stairs. "We
have to go
find him!" She paused. "And Sasami, of course."
        "All right, we should all split up," said Toshiro. "Miss Ayeka and
Miss
Washu, you should look for them at the lake where I crashed."

Spike: (As Toshiro) Velma, you take Shaggy and Scooby to search the old 
demon cave
Clayton: (As Shaggy) Like Zoinks man!
Washu: Jinkies

        Ryoko hit her hand with her fist. "If Nobuyuki and Katsuhito hadn't
left for
town, the could help us look." She thought for a moment. "Mihoshi and
Kiyone,
you look for them down by the cave--"
        Mihoshi squealed in delight. "Yay! Did you hear that, Kiyone? It'll
be like a
Galaxy Police stake-out!"

Ryo-oki: Stake out... make out. Same thing

        Kiyone groaned in despair. "Sure, Mihoshi."
        "--and Toshiro and I will go to the shrine."

Spike: You mean the shrine built directly infront of the cave?

        The young man blushed and nodded.
        "All right everyone," announced Kiyone in her usual battle-mode
style of
speaking, "Let's get this operation underway!"

        Toshiro stared at Ryoko as they walked along the forest path to the
shrine.
She seemed genuinely concerned for Tenchi's safety, much more than she
appeared to be for Sasami. He sighed.
        Ryoko turned to look at him. "What is it, Toshiro?"
        He shook his head. "I was instantly attracted to you when I saw you,
Ryoko,"
he said. "And until now, I thought that you might feel the same way. But now
I
know your heart belongs to Tenchi."
        "Its true that I love Tenchi," she said softly. "But don't get me
wrong,
Toshiro. You're a great guy, and you're definitely gorgeous. But with
Tenchi..." she trailed off.
        "He holds your heart in a way no one else does?" Toshiro finished.
        Ryoko smiled and nodded. "And it's not like there's a shortage of
women
living here. Ayeka was drooling all over you last night."

Clayton: I still think she's a chest burster

       Toshiro's eyes lit up. "Then let's go find your man, Ryoko!"
        They laughed and continued on their way. When they reached the
Masaki shrine,
they found a charming sight.
        Tenchi and Sasami were asleep on the steps of the shrine, his arms
wrapped
around her to keep her warm. The little girl was snoring softly with her
head
on his shoulder, and the furball Ryo-Ohki was sleeping on Tenchi's head.

Washu: How unsanitary
Ryo-oki: Watch your ******* mouth

        Toshiro chuckled. "Tenchi really is a stand-up guy."
        The young man's words awoke Tenchi and Sasami. Tenchi's eyes snapped
open
when he saw Ryoko and Toshiro together, and he sat up straight. Sasami
looked
up at him sympathetically.
        "What are you guys doing here?" he managed to ask as calmly as he
could.

Ryoko: Came to make out and found you

        "You two didn't come home last night," said Toshiro. "Ryoko here was
worried
sick about you."
        Tenchi smiled. "And the real Ryoko shows her face again. Will you be
visiting
often?"
        Ryoko pretended to be offended. "What is it, Tenchi? Don't you like
it when I
blast buildings and rob people blind?"

Tenchi: Kinda
Ryoko: He's kinky that way

        "Actually," said Tenchi, taking her hand, "I could get used to this
Ryoko."
He looked into her golden eyes lovingly.
        Toshiro saw the cue to leave. "I'm going to head on over to the lake
and see
if Miss Ayeka is still there."
        "I'll show you the way," Sasami said, winking at Tenchi. "Come on,
Ryo-Ohki!"
Toshiro and Sasami left, with Ryo-Ohki bouncing after them.

Ryo-oki: Follow the bouncing cabbit

        Ryoko raised an eyebrow. "Does Sasami know something I don't?"

Washu: Yes

        "Sasami knows something a lot of people don't," Tenchi replied.

Clayton: The best damn cookie recipe on the planet

He
sat her
down beside her on the steps. "Look, Ryoko, I know you love me, since you
tell
me all the time."
        "Very true," she chirped.
        "But as I see this side of you," he continued, "I realize that your
space
pirate lifestyle doesn't suit you at all. I know you're a sweet, gentle
person, Ryoko, and I just wish you'd show it."
        Ryoko lowered her eyes. "I know I've done some pretty rotten things
in the
past, and I also know you'll never forgive me for them--"
        "You're wrong, Ryoko," Tenchi interrupted. "I DO forgive you.
And..."

Tenchi: Aw crap. Washu get the dehydration treatment ready

        The young woman looked at him with such sweet innocence that was so
becoming,
that Tenchi failed to complete his sentence.
        "And what, Tenchi?" she asked, knocking him out of his trance.
        "And I..." He couldn't wait any longer. "I love you, Ryoko."
        Ryoko couldn't speak. For a long time she just sat, holding Tenchi's
hand and
staring into his mahogany-colored eyes. She could tell by looking at them
that
he was telling the truth. "I... I..." she stammered.

Ryoko: (As Porkey Pig) I lo... I lo... I lo... aw forget it! (Kisses him)

      Tenchi caressed Ryoko's cheek. "The more I see the real Ryoko, the
more I
can't stop thinking about you. I love you so much, but whenever you lash out
with your cold exterior, it disappoints me."
        Ryoko's eyes filled with tears. "I'm sorry, Tenchi. But the only
reason I act
like I do is because I'm not used to being loved. I'm accustomed to everyone
despising me, and I used to like that. But now... now that I know how you
feel..." Ryoko smiled. "I can't find a good reason to be a jerk."
        Tenchi laughed. "I never liked Ryoko the jerk much anyway."

Ryoko: (squeazing Tenchi's ribs so he can't breathe) What did you call me?

        They both laughed, and Tenchi drew her face close to his with his
hand. He
slowly closed his eyes and pressed his lips to hers. Ryoko wrapped her arms
around his neck and kissed him back.

Clayton: Now that she's won I am certain that Ryoko will conduct herself 
with the dignity and restraint of a true winner and future princess

Suddenly she she pulled away and
screamed
in delight.
"IN YOUR FACE, AYEKA!!" she shouted, literally loud enough to have
been heard
by the princess. "TENCHI LOVES ME!!!!!"

Spike: Or not
Clayton: Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign of a diseased mind
Washu: Really?!!!!!!!

        Mihoshi and Kiyone were walking from the cave that once held Ryoko

Tenchi: Correct me if I'm wrong but Kiyone wasn't in the ones where Ryoko 
was in the cave was she?
Clayton: Just smile and nod

after they
had determined that Tenchi and Sasami were not there, when suddenly they
heard
a distant voice they immediately recognized as Ryoko's shouting, "TENCHI
LOVES
ME!!!"
        Kiyone jumped in surprise. "Did you hear what I just heard?"
        The blonde just giggled. "I knew it all along, Kiyone! Didn't I tell
you?"
        "Yes, Mihoshi," the young woman muttered. "You told me every day."

        "WHAT WAS THAT?!" Ayeka exclaimed. "Did I just hear that witch
right?" The
princess began pacing back and forth.
        Washu put a hand to her chin. "Just as I predicted."

Washu: (Jamaican accent) Call Little Washu's hotline for all your fortune 
telling needs

       Ayeka froze. "What exactly did you predict, Miss Washu?"
        "That our dear Tenchi would most likely fall in love with Ryoko,"
replied the
mad scientist cheerfully.
        Ayeka's eye twitched. "If you had predicted this already, then WHY
DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME??! I wouldn't have tried so hard to win his love!"

All: Bullshit!

Ayeka dropped to
the ground. "How could you, my sweet Tenchi? How could you be seduced by
that
wanted criminal?"

Tenchi: Because wanted criminals are largely very good at seduction

        Sasami and Toshiro arrived at the tree Funaho to see the Juraian
princess in
tears. Toshiro ran to console her. "What's the matter, Miss Ayeka?"
        She wiped her face dry. "Didn't you hear? My Tenchi is in love with
Ryoko."

Spike: Your Tenchi? How many are there?

        "Don't cry, Ayeka," he assured her. "Maybe he just wasn't the right
guy for
you in the first place."
        The girl looked up at Toshiro and blushed. "But he's part of the
Jurai royal
family and--"

Clayton: And that's about it

        "Does that matter?" he interrupted. "Maybe you only loved him
because he was
of noble blood.

Ryoko: And MAYBE the sky is blue
Tenchi: And MAYBE water is wet
Ryo-oki: And MAYBE the princess has a stick shoved up her **** **  * ***  
***** ****

And Ryoko isn't such a bad person. They belong together."
        "I think so, too," said Sasami. "I already knew Tenchi loved her,
but he made
me promise I wouldn't tell."

Washu: That was the night before and you hadn't seen Aeka until now
Spike: And you broke your promise

        Ayeka lowered her eyes. "I suppose I have been rude to Ryoko just
because of
things she did in the past. But now I should be kind to her, to make Tenchi
happy."
        Toshiro helped her to her feet and took her hand in both of his.
"Besides,"
he said softly, "There are other guys who are crazy about you."
        Ayeka smiled. "I must say, Toshiro, you certainly know how to win a
girl's
affections."
        Sasami and Washu looked at each other.

Washu: Don't look at me. I think it's awfully conveinient too

        "I think that's the end of Ayeka's Tenchi obsession," said Washu.

Clayton: Some obsession. Three seconds and she's after the new guy

        Sasami giggled and nodded. Ryo-Ohki mewed happily and gave a flower
to Ayeka.
The princess laughed and scratched the animal's furry head.
        The four turned to see Tenchi and Ryoko walking up to them, his arm
around
her waist. Both were blushing slightly.
        "Well, congratulations to the happy couple!" exclaimed Toshiro.
"She's quite
a catch, Tenchi."

Ryo-oki: So you smell fish too?
Ryoko: That's it! (blasts at Ryo-oki)
Ryo-oki: (Blasts back)
Others: (Get scortched)

        "Way to go, Tenchi!" cried Sasami.
        Tenchi laughed and patted the girl's head. "Thanks, Sasami."
        Ayeka walked up to the two and looked at them. Finally she took a
deep breath
and smiled. "I'm very happy for both of you."
        "What?!" they said in unison.

Spike: (As Wayne) Okay, we've done the one where Aeka skins them alive.
Clayton: (As Garth) Let's do the mega happy ending!

        "Before, I was upset that I was not able to win you heart, Tenchi,"
the
princess continued, "But Toshiro helped me to see that I only loved you
because you were part of the royal family."

Ryoko: Which we told her three or four times an episode
Spike: And I learned that platonic love can't exist between two people of 
the oposite sex

"I'm glad you came to that realization," Tenchi said awkwardly.
        Ayeka took Ryoko's hand. "And I'm sorry, Ryoko," she said sincerely.
"I'm
sorry for how I've treated you."
        Ryoko was genuinely touched. She thought the Juraian princess hated
her.

Washu: Now why would you think that? Aeka only tried to kill you at the 
expence of her and Sasami's lives

"I'm
sorry, too, Ayeka. And I won't tease you about Tenchi loving me and not
you."

Ryoko: (Looks around innocently)

        Tenchi's eyes filled with tears. He had expected the two would tear
each
other limb from limb. *Who would've thought they would make up because of
something like this?* he thought.

Tenchi: (Buzzes in) Who is the author?

        Ayeka smirked. "Oh, I'm over Tenchi, if that's what you're worried
about."
She squeezed Toshiro's arm. "I've got what I need right here!"

Ryoko: Arm... right

        Washu squealed with happiness. "Ohhh, my little girl has found true
love!"

Spike: And the fact that you can feel everything she does has nothing to do 
with it?
Washu and Ryo-oki: Of course not

        Tenchi laughed and hugged Washu's "daughter",

Clayton: Why did they put quotation marks there?

but Ryoko just rolled
her
eyes.
        Mihoshi arrived at Funaho, dragging an exhausted Kiyone behind her.
"I heard
the news!" Mihoshi panted. "Congratulations, Tenchi and Ryoko!"
        Kiyone saw Ayeka and Toshiro together and blinked. "And I guess,
congratulations to Toshiro and Ayeka."
        Sasami looked down at Ryo-Ohki. "How could all have this have
happened in
just two days?"

Ryo-oki: It couldn't

        The creature meowed in astonishment.
        Tenchi was never ceased to be dumbfounded at the things that
happened every
single day at the Masaki household. It was like a roller coaster ride; full
of
ups and downs,

Washu: Manic depressive

but always exciting. And he had such great friends. Even
though
girls could be completely unpredictable, especially his Ryoko, they were the
most wonderful people he had ever met.
        And Toshiro wasn't a jerk after all.

        That night the entire "family" had a bonfire outside. Ayeka was
resting her
head on Toshiro's shoulder, and Ryoko was shamelessly sitting on Tenchi's
lap.
Kiyone was resisting a blackened marshmallow Mihoshi was forcing her to try,

Washu: (As crazed Mihoshi) Eat it!

and Washu and Sasami were playing a game of blackjack on Washu's energy
computer. Sasami was winning.
        Nobuyuki sighed. "My son has found his true love. Soon they will get
married
and move somewhere and get lives of their own."

Spike: And you won't have to pay another repair bill

        Katsuhito was petting Ryo-Ohki. "Do not worry about Tenchi. Even
when he and
Ryoko leave, Washu and Sasami will most likely stay."

All: Why?
Tenchi: Besides I'm going to run grandpa's shrine. Why would I move out?

        "That's true," said Nobuyuki. "I suppose the house won't be quiet
for a long
time."
        Ryoko looked up into Tenchi's eyes. "I love you, Tenchi."
        Tenchi smiled sweetly down at her. "I love you, too, Ryoko." He bent
down and
kissed her.

All: (Stare)
Spike: Bent down?
Ryoko: I was in his lap right?
Washu: And you are taller than him
Clayton: So where did he kiss her?
Ryo-oki: Oh, I think we can guess

        "Ah, what the heck!" cried Toshiro. He leaned over and landed a wet
kiss on
Ayeka. The princess was surprised, but she responded by launching a
full-body
assault on him,

Spike: Uh oh
Ryo-oki: (as Aeka) Pikachu!

knocking him to the ground and kissing him fiercely.
        Tenchi laughed and hugged his Ryoko as they watched the sun fall
behind the
mountains. The light of the fading sun was still brighter than the leaping
flames of the bonfire. Tenchi was confident that as long as he had Ryoko and
his adopted family, his life would be brighter than any sun.

All: (Sing) Born free, where the wind blows, where the grass grows...
