T-is for your pearly white perfect teeth, for when you greet me with your
heavenly smile.
E- is for the energy you always seem to be bountiful of.
N-is for the nerves of steel you must have, to put up with my hyjinx.
C-is for the cutest face in the galaxy!
H-is for the large heart you have, deep in your perfect chest!
I-is because...I love you Tenchi!

M-for the fact that I want to be the mother of your children.
A-is for all the things we've endured together.
S-is for the smiling eyes you bare.
A-is for all the stars and planets I'd give to you.
K-is for the kisses I'd gladly give to you.
I-is for the fact that you never get ill-tempered with me!

~Ryoko gets up to see if any one is looking. She shoves the peice of paper
in her shirt and runs off to find Tenchi!~
