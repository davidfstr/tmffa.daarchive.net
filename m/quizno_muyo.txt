"Tenchi Muyo!" and characters created by Hiroki Hayashi and Masaki Kajishima and 
are the property of AIC/Pioneer.  I do not own the characters, nor the series.  
I just write the fiction.

trademarts of Quizno'sr Inc.

(Setting:  Empty room, white walls, with single table with chair.  Inside room, 
man with white shirt and tie, seated at table, Mihoshi, facing two subs.)

Man:  Ma'am, which would you prefer, this toasted low-fat sub, or this untoasted 
low-fat sub.

Mihoshi (giggles):  Why that's silly, this toasted sub, of course.  (As Mihoshi 
reaches for the toasted sub, Man presses a secret button, which drops a helmet 
over Mihoshi's eyes.)

Mihoshi:  WHAT!?!  WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTS?  (Starts fumbling around for 
the toasted sub) Now where is that sub?  (As Mihoshi fumbles with her hands for 
the toasted sub, Man secretly switches toasted for the untoasted sub.  Mihoshi 
grabs the untoasted sub and takes a bite)

Man (speaking into micro-recorder):  Immedietly grabs for the untoasted sub.

Kiyone (in small circle in scene):  This was expected.

Washu (In Quizno'sr restaruant, near toasting oven):  The only way those other 
guys can ever compete with Quizno'sr oven-toasted subs is to cheat.  (Scene 
switches to Quizno'sr Honey Bourbon Chicken Subr)  Try Quizno'sr Honey Bourbon 
Chicken Subr, lots of taste, low in fat.

(Scene switches to sandwich gradually being eaten, reveiling Quizno'sr logo) Mm-
Mm-Mm-Mm-Mm!  Toasty.
