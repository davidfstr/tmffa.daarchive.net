This is Version 4 of "our" songfilk.^_^

Derick Browne, the guy who did this piece of songfilk is a genius!  Full
credit should be given to him.  However, being the true hip-hop fan I was
raised to be, I found his filk a bit too hard to coincide with the original.
Therefore, I decided to refine it in most areas.  Don't worry.  I'm also a
Tenchi fan as well.

Slim Tenchi
<Purge Raizah Wu-York Remix>

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is.. Slim Tenchi

Chorus repeats X4

[Mr. Fugisawa]
Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class...  For a second, please?

[Tenchi]
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Kids: "Yeah yeah!")
Wanna see me stick my light hawk wings up her highness?(Aeka: "WHAT?!")
Copy me and do exactly what I did?
Meet alien ladies and get as messed up as my life is?
Mayuka's dead weight, trying to get her head straight
As I figure out which alien girl I wanna impregnate (NOT YOU SASAMI!)
Mr. Fugisawa "Tenchi, don't be a baby!
Lucky dog's surrounded by all types of ladies!"
Well I feel like a caged elf going through hell
Every time Washu locks me in that lab I call a cell. (LET ME OUTTA HERE!!)
Kiyone's pissed off when someone tried to rip me off,
She kissed me and said, "You Earth guys are REAL soft!"
I'm bout to fall down and crash
Like the time Mihoshi came through the atmosphere way to fast.
(Mihoshi: "OUTTA MY WAY!!")
C'mere lady! (Ranma: "Wait a minute, Akane's my girl dog!")
I don't give a damn!  At least I don't tick the world off!

Chorus X4

[Tenchi]
Nagi got pissed one day and blew up my junior high (Nagi: "Oops!")
Thanks a lot.. next semester, I'll be thirty-five
She chased me around with a saber, shot at me with some lasers,
Teachers were forced to changed the grades on my paper (Here!)
Walked in the drink club, Trakal was tanked up. (Trakal: "BURP!!")
Paid the bartender when he BLEW UP THE WHOLE PUB!!!
Damn those extraterrestrial pedestrians.
Chasing after me saying, "LET'S BE MORE THAN FRIENDS!"
Since Ryoko's free, I found that I was lied to (Grandpa's an alien???)
Seems that Mitsuki breaks more rules than I do
Never thought I'd become a famous rapper
Singing about crimes and naming them after her (Here hun!)
You know you blew up the stands
When people write more fics about you than Ghost In Shell fans (Motoko: "Is
_That_ a fact?!")
Some guy gave me a Sasami lemon to tackle
I wrote back, "Thanks for your loyal support, @$$hole."

Chorus X4

[Tenchi]
Stop the tape! Kagato wants to blow me away! (Get him!)
Pixy Misa, don't just stand there, AMSCRAY!! (Misa: "C'mon, mon cher!")
'Cause life's to short!  I'm not ready to die!
I rather drag Ryoko back to the shrine and burry her alive
I'm now in Tokyo, a new future wife! (Sakuya: "Hi, Tenchi!")
Didn't drive me to kill myself with a knife
But she visits me in the dead of night
She doesn't even have fangs, but she still wants to bite! (AAAAHH!!)
Rip my clothes off whenever I tried to walk (RIIIP!!)
Like eagles and hawks.  For I'm the prey they stalk
Get so angry I would throw fits; (Ryoko: "C'mere, baby.")
DAMMIT, RYOKO!! I DON'T WANNA SEE YOUR TITS!!
Still I'm a nice guy, though I'm mislead
Check to make sure Ryo-Ohki didn't poop on my bed (Ryo-Ohki: "Myaah?")
My life is bad.  Anyway, if you see my dad,
Tell him to stop collecting all those filthy mags!

Chorus X4
