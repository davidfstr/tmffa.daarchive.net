This song is a little dark, and DEFINITELY lime. It might even be lemon.
You decide.
 It's loosely based upon the song 'Christian Woman', by Type O Negative.

Enjoy.

Juraian Woman
--------------

A picture on her bedroom wall
>From Jurai she did fall.
An image burning in her mind
And envy between her thighs.

A man-her god-
Puts her through pain
When will you come again?
Before him beg
To serve always
On your back or knees.

No releases for her desires
While hating her rivals
Will she suffer eternally
And internally?

For her lusts
She'll fight Ryoko
Her skin done medium rare
All through attempted stimulation
Salvation?

Body of Tenchi
She Needs-
Body of Tenchi
(Repeat)

She'd like to know Tenchi
Oh, love Tenchi
Feel-feel-feel Tenchi-sama
Inside of her
Deep inside of her....
--------------------------------
I think I'll stop now.

I know how the rest of the song goes, but I don't think we're quite up
to a chorus of "Tenchi-sama looks like me", really?

Besides, I'm blushing like nothing on Earth already.

Ja ne!
