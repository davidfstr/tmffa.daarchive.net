        "I don't see how he keeps on doing it," Marc grumbled, stepping out
of his RV onto the theater floor. He shook his head and sat down.

        "No profanity? No gunfire?" Xellos asked, smiling.

        "Fuck off," was Marc's curt reply.

        "Well, I'm glad to see that we're all here!" Xellos said. "I got
a reall good one for you this time. A Sasami lemon!"

        "Why'd you go do that?" Tau complained. "Our stomachs can't take
that kind of stuff."

        "I enjoy it very throughly," Xellos said, his smile growing more
malicious.

        The group is seated, from the left: Xellos, Tau, GT, Marc, Kagato,
Magus.

<Xellos> : Let the show begin!
<Magus> : I have work to do...
<Tau> (looking at GT) : So do we...
<GT> (grinning) : Yes, we do.
<Kagato> : Not tonight, please.
<Tau> : True, we wouldn't want to burn the virgin's eyes.
<Kagato> : Shut up!

>                     Misty Waterflower

<Magus> : With a title like that, I'm frightened.
<Xellos> : That's not the title. That's the author.
<Marc> (scribbling name down)

>                     sasami_misty@hotmail.com

<Magus> (winking) : What a putz... she uses Hotmail!
<Kagato> : Hold on, Magus. Don't you use--
<Magus> (interrupting) : Hush.

>                My love for Tenchi (from Sasami's point of view)

<Kagato> : Uh oh...

>                      lemon

<Tau> : Even worse...

>        Sasami confesses to Tenchi that she loves him

<Marc> (in narrator's voice) : And has wild sex with him.
<Xellos> : More or less.

>
>i don't own Tenchi Muyo and Sasami is 14 years old and Tenchi is 17.
>

<GT> : Since when?
<Kagato> : She was 8 when I saw her, but Tenchi was 17...
<Tau> : Hmm... perhaps Tenchi has been in a stasis field!
<Magus> : Maybe the author's just a damn fool.

>                       My love for Tenchi

<All> : Here we go!!!

>It all started when i got up to make breakfast in the Masaki house.As i 
>shut

<GT> : Yeah, that's how it usually happens...

>my door I was glad Tenchi had built me my own room,so i didn't wake

<Magus> : Umm... no. I could think of 2 reasons why not just off the top of
        my head.

>My sister Aeka,or Ryoko, Washu,Mihoshi,Kiyone.So then I passed Tenchi's 
>room
>and I notised it was open so I went in to cheak that Ryoko wasn't hurting

<GT> : Not hurting, "wrestling."
<Others> (chuckle)

>him,I gave a sigh of relif to see Tench asleep in his bed.I left so I could
>start on breakfast,after I got breakfast started i quietly creeped it his

<Tau> : Careful... food's burning.
<Magus> : When did she start sneaking into his room?
<Kagato> : Precisely the moment when this author started writing.

>room.Tenchi was still asleep,i went in and my heart started to pound,i 
>loved

<Kagato> : Oh, God, no...

>Tenchi ever since I met him but i don't chase after him because it's 
>useless
>to force some one to love you,i kneeled at his bed side and i picked up his
>hand and placed it agenst my cheek.i got up and cleaned his room and when i

<Kagato> : * whew * That was close.

>was done i kissed him on the fore-head,then left.It was about 9:00am when

<GT> : Tenchi must've been busy with Ryouko last night, because there's
        no other way he'd be tired enough to sleep through someone
        cleaning his room!
<Magus> (shaking head) : No, no, no, you forgot. Sasami is, in this fic,
        a member of the Cleaning clan of Ninja.
<GT> : Ah, makes sense now.

>everyone came to the table to eat as they did i got out more plates for 
>more
>helpings then i heared Tenchi say"Last night I had a weired dream that
>Sasami kissed me", <CRASH> I dropped some plates,how did he know that i
>kissed him so i was picking up the broken plates when it sliped and cut me
>it was a deep cut but i wraped it in a cloth so i could finish up. Later on

<Marc> : ARRRGGHHHH!!!!! * blathers something unintelligible *
<GT> : Marc, quit quoting the fic!
<Magus> (shaking head) : The bad grammar was just too much...

>that day it was 4:00pm i went in to Tenchi's room to get something for him

<Tau> (as Tenchi) : Wow, Sasami, thanks for getting for me! I have one just
                like it in my room... waitaminute...

>and i looked at one of his manga books and read it it was "star wars" and 
>at
>a part two people kissed after the girl called him a scoundrell. so i 
>tooked
>it for later.

<Kagato> (firing energy bolts wildly at the screen) : USE BETTER GRAMMAR!!!

>That night i had a nightmare"i saw tenchi and ryo-oh-ki get
>murdered and everyone blamed me, stop please i didn't do it.OH THEN WHY DO
>YOU HAVE BLOOD STAINS ALL OVER YOU.no i don't  have blood on me what is 
>this
>,no let me go 
>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPP
>PPPPPPPPPPMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.Ah i felt so scared so i

<Magus> (head doing a 3600) : Hommina hommina hommina hommina!!
<Marc> (begins speaking in tongues)
<Tau> (pulls out Plasma Cannon at screen)
<GT> (starts crying)
<Kagato> (continues firing wildly at screen)
<Xellos> (laughs at the others)

>went down stares to see if every one was ok . i looked in tenchi's room and
>he wasn't there so i went in to his bed and cryed then all of a sudden i 
>heard Tenchi whisper "sasami whats wrong why are you crying"?"Oh i'm sorry

<Magus> : Wouldn't she be deposited in the lake if she didn't knock?

>lord Tenchi i didn't mean to wake you up,i was going to leave when Tenchi

<Kagato> : "Tenchi-sama??" Isn't that what Aeka calls Tenchi?
<Tau> : Yup. Apparently this author didn't know that.

>wanted to know what happed as i told him I saw the consern in his loving 
>eyes.when i had
>finished i asked"tenchi let me stay with you please","ok sasami he said.He

<Xellos> (passes out the bags)
<GT> : Hooo, boy.

>led me to his bed and as i got in he wraped his arms a round me and we fell
>asleep.Unkowned to us Ryoko decited to do some thing  with tenchi but she
>saw me in his bed his arms wraped around me and she screamed "AEKA EVERYONE
>GET DOWN HERE" That woke every one up but not me or Tenchi.Then as we slept

<Magus> : Hey, Kagato...
<Kagato> (looking at Magus) : What's up, chief?
<Magus> : How loudly can Ryouko scream?
<Kagato> : A Metallica concert is like a whisper to her loudest scream.
<Magus> (nodding) : She's screaming in the same room as they are, yet they
        are still asleep.
<Kagato> : Only if they are deaf!!

>Aeka grabed Tenchi and screamed"HOW DARE YOU FUCK MY LITTLE SISTER YOU
>BASTERED" I woke up when Ryoko was about to hit him so i jumped and took 
>the
>blow.

<GT> : You know... Tenchi is Yousho's grandson. I don't think Aeka would
        be questioning his legitamacy.
<Marc> : Not to mention that taking a powerful Ryouko punch would 
undoubtedly
        kill Sasami.

>"Sasami what did he do to you,cause i'll take care of him'" said
>Ryoko,Aeka,Washu,and Mihoshi.

<Tau> : What is this, some sort of Broadway musical?!
<All> (get up, do a song and dance) :

"This fic sucks! It's really bad!
The author's storyline is nothing short of sad.
And technically, it's a travesty.
It sucks! SUCKS! SUUUUUUUUCKS!"

<All> (sit back down)

[Note: I have never seen a MSTing crew do a song and dance in the middle
        of a MST. That's hardcore. - MTD]

>"STOP LEAVE TENCHI ALONE HE DIDN'T DO ANY
>THING TO ME I GOT SCARED AND I ASKED IF I COULD STAY WITH HIM SO STOP IT" I
>screamed "Sasami you don't understand that he couldn't love you" said washu
>"No you don't understand that even if he didn't care about us then i still
>would l..l..lo..v..e him.i said ,"You what"said Aeka,"I said i love Tenchi
>Masaki as much as you did maybe even more!Right there i broke into tears 
>and
>ran to my room and locked the door.

<GT> : Thus ends the FIRST PARAGRAPH.
<Tau> : At least the author got Tenchi's last name correct.
<Kagato> : And I just don't see Aeka going off on her beloved little
        sister like that.

>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<Marc> : The author's pulse after I find her.
<Xellos> : Now, Marc, if you killed her, how could she continue to write 
just
        wonderful pieces of torture?
<Tau> (to Xellos) : Notice the bumps in the line? Marc wouldn't kill this
        poor soul...
<Marc> (winking) : Precisely. Slow, eternal torture is much better.

>after two days in my room i went out of my room to take a bath when i ran

<Magus> : Who cooked meals?
<GT> : Prolly Washuu.
<Kagato> (drools over the thought of Washuu's cooking)
<Marc> (shrugs) : Blood's better.

>into Tench i tryed to run but Tenchi held me. Please let me go I said
>"Sasami i need to talk to you" so we went in his room and he locked

<All> : Bow chitty bow bow...

>the door,I moved to his bed and he got down one knee and took out a black
>box and said "Princess Sasami of Juri will you Marry me" I welled up in
>tears and said "Yes..yes i'll marry you Tenchi"I said and I huged him then

<GT> : So much for his sweet spinelessness.
<Tau> (smiling) : You still have me.
<GT> (chuckling) : You're about as spineless as a hedgehog.

>we kissed,I let his tounge go in my mouth and explore,while he held
>me.Thenhe started to take of the light blue tank top I was wearing and un
>lack the front of my size c-cup bra<big for my age huh?> we broke the kiss

<Marc> : In all my 500 years, I have never seen an 8-year old with
        C-CUPS!!
<Tau> : Greenie or myself could whip up some concoction to _greatly_ and
        _rapidly_ enhance sexual maturity.

>as he lowered his head down to my breast and took hold of one and kneded it

<Magus> (as an Italian pizza guy) : I make-a you fresh pie.
<Kagato> (drools at the thought of pizza)

>and took the other in to his mouth,i gave a low moan in that it felt so
>wonderful,"Lord Tenchi"I said,He looked up from his work on me and said"yes
>my darling","Tenchi please violate my innosent skin make me want you more
>then I do now make ME pleasure you,for now I'm yours to play with,to toy
>with to do what ever you desire my love"He gave me another sweet kiss,he

<Marc> : By Eris Discordia! She's 8!! Strong words for a 8 year old!
<Kagato> : Anyone else notice the total lack of periods there?
<Marc> : 8 year old... lack of periods... I see the connection.
<GT> (clubs the Holy Hell out of Marc)
<Marc> (grabs his Holy Hell and puts it back in his pocket)

>tasted like a sweet drink that you crave.Then he layed me down and undid mt
>blue-jean shorts and tossed them aside with my bra and top.He gased at my
>panties they were  white with no frills but had a latch to open them.as he

<Magus> : Kinky little girl, isn't she?
<Tau> : Indeed.

>opened them he kissed my area until i came,"what a naughty girl I'll have 
>to
>clean you up" said Tenchi"oh yes please tenchi"i said.Tenchi began to lick
>my pussy"OOOHHH TENCHI"I moaned he opened me up and looked in me to find my

<Kagato> (looking green) : Ugh... I hope this doesn't last too long...

>treasures that i said were now his for the taking.As he continued to lick 
>me
>i was coming ever closer to cumming then he licked my jewel and thats all 
>it
>took,"TENCHI!!!!" I screamed he opened his mouth wide so he wouldn't miss a
>drop.

<Kagato> : Too much... can't hold it in... (makes good use of the barf bag)

>"oh God tenchi",i whispered.I tryed to get up but Tenchi said"Sasami
>let me do it" he let me watch him undress.I watched wide eyed as i saw his
>bare cheast.It was covered with muscles from his hard work and training 
>with

<Magus> : Like she's never seen his bare chest before!

>Yosho.Then i saw what all of the girls in the house would die to see I 
>gazed
>at his huge dick.As soon as i saw it i pulled it to my mouth  and i sucked

<All, ex. Xellos> : NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! (5 lost lunches result)
<Xellos> (snickering) : The fun's just starting.

>it,licked itand made Tenchi grip the bed in pleasure."Oh Sasami your so
>uuhh" It didn't take him long to cum."SASAMI"Tenchi screamed I opened my
>mouth to drink him,man his cum was soo good but it was salty.After Tenchi

<Magus> : Unnecessary information!

>was up again he Kissed me and tasted him self I too had tasted myself on 
>him
>I had no clue i tasted like cotten candie. He pined me on his bed and 
>placed
>a rubber on his dick that was between my pussy lips and said "Sasami Do yo
>want me to have intercorce with you"?

<Tau> (as Tenchi) : Although you really don't have much choice, being pinned
        down and all.

>I said yes but be gentel it's my first
>time".It's also mine said  Tenchi as he pushed it in i felt my virginity
>being riped inside.I didn't scream but i shed a tear.Tenchi i guess saw it

<Xellos> (looking around) : No more hurling?
<Magus> (shaking head) : This is just badly written to inspire illness.
<Marc> : Insanity, maybe.

>and licked it and said "now there will only be joy", and he pushed it 
>slowly

<Tau> : How the hell would he know, being a virgin and all?

>and then went faster and faster."Oh sasami yes" said tenchi I let out a 
>moan
>of pleasure as he kept on fucking me it felt so good after awhile a new
>feeling was building up i needed tenchi to go harder and deeper for some
>reason.

<Marc> : Okay, let me get this straight.. she goes from kinky slut to
        virginal innocent in the span of about 5 minutes.
<GT> : Seems that way.

>OH tenchi do it harder please", he did it was so good he made me moan
>for him and want him to be with me forever.But then I cummed and
>hard"TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHIIIIII"!as

<Magus> (summons up some water and splashes it on his face) : Xellos, make
        sure that the fic doesn't have a line like that.
<Others, including Xellos> (stare blankly at that one line for about 5
        minutes, then finally break free)
<Xellos> : Will do, Magus.. this time, I truly am sorry.

>i screamed he still pumped himself never stoping then he came in me as i
>orgasumed again with him"SSSSAAAASSSSAAAAMMMMIIII","TTTEEENNNCCCHHHIII!

<All> (stare blankly at this line for about 5 mins before breaking free)
<Kagato> : Is he going to keep doing this??

>Tenchi climbed off me and said "sasami your the best thats why your my 
>fiannc`e" then he kissed

<Tau> : Yeah, like he has a large sample data to compare Sasami to.

>me. After 4 hours of sleep and a shower together we got dressed and told
>them"WE'RE GETTING MARRIED" Then Ryoko and Aeka began to cry in defete and 
>i
>Told them  it was ok  but they would live with it then as we were 
>celebratin

<Marc> : Celebrating? Ryouko and Aeka would likely run out and drink
        themselves into oblivion!
<Magus> : Suddenly, Tenchi is a cold-hearted fiend! Thank you, Sasami!

>the house began to rummble and a tracter beam surrond me and we saw Kagato

<Kagato> : Ulp!
<Others> (slowly and dangerously) : Kagato....

>in all his Evil glory staring at me and the last thing I remember was 
>Tenchi
>was screaming"NO SASAMI COME BACK I LOVE YOU I NEED YOU,LET HER GO KAGATO

<GT> : Kagato, how could you?!
<Kagato> : It wasn't me!
<Magus> : How did you sneak away?
<Kagato> (desperately looking around to avoid looking at the frowns) : It
        was someone else!
<Magus> : Well, I guess it's back to the Punishment Sphere for you.
<Kagato> : I was here the whole time!!
<Tau> : But the fic is written in the past tense.


>then........................................

<Marc> : The author died!
<Magus> : No such luck.

>TO BE CONTINUED

<Xellos> (rubs hands together)
<Magus> : Hopefully not!

>so how did you like it e-mail me at Sasami_misty@hotmail.com
>

<Magus> : Refer to our song-and-dance routine for our opinion.
<Marc> : Xellos, please make sure that the next piece of garbage you
        force on us makes sense.
<Tau> : Yeah, what are we watching next?
<Xellos> (opening one eye) : Sore wa himitsu desu!
<Marc> : Huh?
<Kagato> : He said "It's a secret."
<Marc> : Bastard.

        Thus I end another fine MST. I sincerely hope that this MST at
least brought some enjoyment into this fic. For those of you driven insane
by some of those lines up there, I assure you, Cthulu is very real and
he will eat you.

Good night!

MTD
