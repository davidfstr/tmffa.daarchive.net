Ayeka's meaningful kiss
By Jenna Evans (Spacegirlmimi@aol.com)

   It was a cold day on this day. Ayeka was wrapped up in her jacket. The
heater was broken and everyone was freezing cold. "Tenchi can you fix the
heater?" asked Sasmi. "No Sasmi I can't." "Great we all will be freezing
cold
all night." "Oh stop your complaining you ugly monster." said Ayeka to
Ryoko.
"What did you just call me?" "Oh nothing." Ayeka had an evil smirk on her
face. "Ayeka." said Tenchi. Tenchi knew what she said.Tenchi smiled. Ayeka
blushed. "Ayeka come here." said Tenchi. Tenchi walked outside. "Tenchi it's
snowing." Tenchi began to cry a little. "Tenchi may I ask what's
wrong?""Well
Ayeka, my mother died on a snowy day." Ayeka made a weak smile at Tenchi.
"I'm very sorry." Tenchi glanced at Ayeka."Ayeka." "Yes?" "Come here."
Tenchi
walked out into the woods. "Why are we here?" asked Ayeka. "I wanted to be
alone with you?""Serious?"asked Ayeka."Yes Ayeka." Tenchi kissed Ayeka's
lips. Ayeka shut her eye's and enjoyed the sweet taste. Ryoko saw the two of
them. "Now what is going on?" asked Ryoko. As her eye's filled up with
tears.
"I...I.." "Oh you just happened to kiss her!" Ryoko began running far away
from the two of them.

     That was a short one of the Ayeka kissing Tenchi for the first time.I
hope you all enjoyed that.Next time the two find Ryoko nearby.In Ryoko's
goodbye.

                    So please remind me of what my next tittle is I have a
baddddd memory thankyou so much.
