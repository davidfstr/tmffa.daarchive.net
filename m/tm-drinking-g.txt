Disclaimer: For this disclaimer I will
write in rhyme!

Tenchi and the gang are property of AIC and Pioneer, 
who should buckle down and get their bums in gear,
but for now we all just write fan fics,
Cos they're behaving like a bunch of...nasty people.

This fic is property of The Jetset (Jinchi, 
Jim 'Diabolo' Moore, and Kage Maru 3:16)  

Anyway, this is all in the style of most drinking
game. Although strictly speaking it's not really
drinking- more a point game. You can convert it
to drinks if you like, but you will get drunk very
quickly.
