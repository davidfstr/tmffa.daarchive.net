laughing my ass of, wonering how he can
Tenchi the moron, he will never get a gall
looking in his fathers books
bleeding all over them
Tenchi the moron he will never loose his pants..

Blasting her mom away dreaming of it anyway
Ryoko the shadowshrew, chasing Tenchi IGOTYOU!
trying to make him desire her
trying to make him lo'ove her
Ryoko the shadowshrew always annoying you

Playing his wicked game, coughing out his wicked way
E-mao the evil man he will never gett a gall
always playing trix on me
never studying history
E-mao the evil man he will get his teeth in hand

Royal bitch is her way this is all I will say
Aeka high on heels,screaming out then she squeels
ranting about her promisquite
jumping in Tenchi's bed at a wim you see
Aeka high on heels screaming louder and louder an..

lalalala cant come up with any more verses comeup with some of your own
lalalalalalal
