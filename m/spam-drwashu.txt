Tenchi: "Uh, Washuu,"

Washuu: "Washuu-CHAN!"

Tenchi: "Washuu-chan, can I ask you a question?"

Washuu: "Why certainly Tenchi."

Tenchi: "About Cabbits, how they have variable size and regenerate after
    death, I bet they can travel through time as well as space?"

Washuu: "Uh, quite possibly."

Tenchi: "That's it, you didn't make the Cabbits yourself, you swiped them
    from the planet Galifrey!"

Washuu: "Tenchi, how could you know about that?"

Tenchi: "He told me."

The Doctor: "Jellybaby?"

K-9 and Azaka: (Studying each other) "Highly illogical design."

    Everybody else is far more cynical than I am.
    They know better than to say anything about it.
