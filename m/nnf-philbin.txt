No Need for Philbin-a Tenchi Muyo skit featuring Kain.

Regis Philbin: Welcome back to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire!  I'm Regis
Philbin, and our contestant tonight is Kain.  Welcome to the show, Kain.
Kain: My patience grows thin.  Commence with your inquiries, Mr. Philbin.
RP: Ok, don't 'have a cow, man'.  (chuckle)
(Kain's eyes narrow)
RP: Uh…ok, first question.  This feathered animal makes a quacking sound.
Is
it: A, a cow; B, a duck; C, an elephant; or D, a crocodile?
K: It is B.  It is insulting for you to even ask me that, you fool.
RP: Is that your final answer?
K: What?
RP: Are you sure it's B?
K: Yes, now ask the next question.
RP: Would you like to use a lifeline?
K: No!  I said B is the answer!  Move on before I decide to destroy you!
RP: So you don't want to use a lifeline?  How about an audience poll?
K:  urgh…b is my final answer, you useless mortal!
RP: (After long silence)  Yes, B is correct!  You've won $100!
(Applause)
RP: Ok, the next one is for $200.  You wanna keep going?
K: Yes.
RP: Are you sure?
K: Do not test me, human.  The power of Kain is beyond your comprehension.
RP: Ok, big guy.  (chuckle)  Let's move on.  The next question is for 200
bucks: This species is the only one on this planet that speaks English.  Is
it A, a human; B, a rabbit; C, a kangaroo; or D, a three-toed sloth?
K: The answer is A.  Do not wear out my patience.  Otherwise, you run the
risk of a horrible death at my hands.
RP: (Hesitates)  …Is that your final answer?
K: AAAARRRGGGH!!!!!  I will not tolerate this any longer!  Prepare to DIE!!!
(Kain envelopes Philbin.  Muffled screams)
K: Is that your final answer, human?  HmhmhmhmhahahhahAAAAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
(Yoooh!) THE END
