All right!! I finally finished my first fanfic! 
Kitana: Wow! Who cares? 
Don't be jealous just because you can't make one by yourself, you 
need my help!
Kitana: (big sweat drop) NOT TRUE!!!
Well anyway here is my first fanfic Tenchi Chooses.


It was a regular morning at the Masaki house. Ryoko 
sneaked into Tenchi's room again and Tenchi was putting on his 
shirt. Ryoko appeared in front of Tenchi, put her head on Tenchi's 
chest, and started to purr. Tenchi jumped back. "Ryoko! I told you 
not to come in here without knocking!!! I am getting sick and tired 
of telling you every time!" Tenchi screamed. Ryoko was shocked 
and Tenchi was too for what he just did. Ryoko starts to look as if 
she might cry at any minute. Ryoko starts to fly away and Tenchi 
was about to apologize when he realized it was too late.
 
	She flew to the shrine and sat on the roof. She hugged her 
feet and began to cry. *Why can't I tell Tenchi that I love him? * 
Ryoko thinks to herself. *Maybe he does love Ayeka* 

"Ryoko!" screamed Tenchi. He was looking for her after breakfast 
because she didn't show up. "Ryoko!" * Where is she? I didn't 
mean to be mean Ryoko. Please forgive me* Tenchi thought to 
himself. He thinks of where she might be. Maybe the cave, maybe 
the roof of the house, or maybe of the shrine. Tenchi decides to 
look in the cave. She isn't there. Then he goes to the roof of the 
house. She isn't there either. Then he looks on the shrine roof. 
There she was asleep. Tenchi climbs up on the roof and trys to 
wake Ryoko up. Ryoko wakes up and sees Tenchi. "Tenchi?" was 
Ryoko's only response. 

"I am sorry I screamed at you Ryoko. I didn't mean to scream at 
you I just got mad because it wasn't the first time I told you to 
knock. Please forgive me" was all Tenchi could say. Ryoko just 
stared at him with an expression no one can read. "Tenchi I need 
to tell you something." "What is it Ryoko?" "Tenchi do you 
remember when you freed me from the cave?" "Yes I do."  

"Well, I have loved you ever since you were a little boy on you 
mothers back. It seemed as if you saw me." *Tenchi remembers 
seeing something but now sure* "I have loved you since that day. 
That is why I have been here everyday waiting to see if you would 
return the same emotions I have."

*Ryoko starts to cry* Tenchi wants to do anything kiss her but then 
she would think he is saying he loves her or hold her not letting go. 
Ryoko starts to say bad things about her self because who would 
ever think a country boy like Tenchi would fall in love with a space 
pirate like Ryoko. It is an unusual match.

Tenchi lends forward and kisses Ryoko on the lips. *Yes this is the 
right choice* Tenchi thinks to himself as Ryoko kisses back. Tenchi 
breaks the kiss and hugs Ryoko. He whispers in her ears "Ryoko I 
love you and I will always love you." Ryoko stays in his arms. 
Ryoko fazes Tenchi to the front of the house. She holds Tenchi 
hands and enters the house while thinking *This is all perfect 
except that Ayeka is going to throw a fit when we tell her.
