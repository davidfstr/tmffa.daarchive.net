Ksa and The MSTers: File 4

The theater was nice and quiet. If buildings could think, this one would think
*Please God, let them be dead*
The doors flew open, and Ksawarrior lead his team inside.
*Damn* the theater thought.
"Man, that was a hoot! I think we should visit Peter more often." Ksa said.
"So long as I get to hit Ranma." Ryoga Hibiki replied.
"NO! Jeez, haven't ya learned yet?" Scimitar asked. "But I would like to see B-Ko again.
"Eh?" Ksa looked to his PC. "Its a message from Tank Cop!" 
"The weirdo who did that Pretty Sammy lemon?" Rei Ayanami asked Ksa.
"The one and only." he replied. "Its another fic. A dark one this time."
"Oh great," Scimitar groaned, "Instead of disgusted, we'll be depressed."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer: I love Tenchi Muyo, but I didn't come up with them.  So don't sueme.

>Ksa: Why wear suide, when you can wear sueme?

I love the Tenchi Muyo villains even more then I love the heroes.  It takes a
good villain to make a great hero.

>Scimitar: Oh, you don't want to meet my villian.
>Ryoga: You've got a villian?
>Rei: Since when?
>Scimitar: Since Ksa started work on me again.

  My two favorites are Nagi and Kain.

>Ksa: So he likes revenge obsessed weirdos or psychotic weirdos.
>Rei: That's sad.

Nagi
- Has a darker hate for Ryoko, then Ryoko has for her.

>Ksa: Well, the evil one is supposed to hate more than the, um...
>Ryoga: Slightly good?
>Ksa: Yeah, slightly good one.

  Kain - Is the
embodiment of pure evil, dedicated to one goal and one goal alone, the
complete destruction of the house of Juria.

>Scimitar: Visit Juria, 2 planets over from Jurai.
>Ryoga: Please purchase a Hibiki map on your way.

This story is dedicated to Kain, one of my favorite villains.  If you want to
see my other favorite villain Nagi.  Then read my series "A Matter of Life or
Death."  Coming in mid August or early September.

>Rei: Its not to good to say when a fic comes out. Ruins the surprise.
>Ksa: Rei, what are you talking about?
>Rei: Nothing. ^_^
>Others: Gah! It does smiles.

  I know you'll love it.

>Scimitar: Please say there's a money back gurantee.
>Ryoga: Why?
>Scimitar: If we hate it, we can take all his money.
>Ryoga: Ahh.

Warning: If you are offended in any way by the deaths of any Tenchi Muyo
characters.  Then you should not read any further.

>All: .....................
>Scimitar: Thats it. He just crossed the line.

Note: This is a Dark Fanfic which mean it has death, murder, bad word, ect.

>Ksa: You already mentioned death.

by Tank Cop

Kain's Revenge

>All:(ominously) But on who?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Ksa: ARRGHH! He seperates passages the same way I do! 
>Scimitar: Your point?
>Ksa: None whatsoever.

Sasami enter Washu's subspace lab.  The little crab on the door rings!RING,RING

>Ryoga: It rings in a dramatic ring!
>Ksa: Man, that was redundant.

"Washu its time for dinner."  Sasami calls out, but no one answers.
"Washu where are you, hello."  She ventures even deeper into her subspace
lab.

>All but Ryoga: WHERE IN THE LAB AM I NOW!?
>Ryoga:(muttering) Stupid jerks. Not my fault I'm lost.

  Until she comes apon a strange blue ball (or sphere if you want).

>Rei:(as baby) I WANNA SQUARE!
>Scimitar:(as mother) You'll take your ball and like it!

  The
ball vibrates with a strange blue glow (like in Star Wars 1, you know the one
Boss Nass held up at the end).

>Ksa: Alien vibrator spheres.
>Scimitar: So, thats why Washu stays in her lab!
>Rei:(sighs) Not again.
>(Ryoga is out with a nosebleed. Ksa takes out the Nyoibo staff and hits him)
>Ksa: Wake up baka!
>Ryoga: AAAHH!

  It almost seems alive!  "What a prettyball."

>All:(facefault) ...................
>Ryoga: So Azusa was in Washu's lab as well.
>Ksa: What do you think she'd call the ball?
>Scimitar: I'd say, Francine.

 Sasami walks over to the ball and holds it in the air.  Suddenly, the ball
gives off a burst of energy.  "AAAGGGHHH!"  Sasami screams in pain and falls
unconciseness on the floor.  THUMP

>Rei: Thump? Thats it?
>Ksa: Well Sasami's dead.
>Scimitar: Unconcious actually.
>Ryoga: After Tank Cop's last fic with her, she must be happy only this has happened.

Hours later.  "Sasami...Sasami...are...you...ok?
Can...you...hear...me?"

>Ryoga: William Shatner found her.
>Ksa: There's...something in the lab......someone...
>Rei:(Washu) Oh thats just Ryo-Ohki.

Sasami slowly opens hear eyes and sees Washu kneeling
infront of her.  "oh Miss Washu I'm..."  Sasami fades once again out of
conciseness.  Washu takes Sasami in her arms and takes her to her room.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aeka stands outside Sasami's room with a wet wash cloth while Washu tellsher
what happened.

>Scimitar: After she tellsher, she might want to tell her as well.
>Others: Lame.

  "It seems that Sasami touched some kind of alien device that
caused her to lose conciseness for several hours."

>Ksa: It was in Washu's lab, and its an alien device, and she doesn't say where she found it?
>Rei: Remember who's writing this.

  "Is she going to be ok?"
Aeka asked.  She'll be fine, she just has a very bad headache.  She'll need
some aspirin and some sleep, that's all."

>Ryoga: Who the hell was talking?
>Scimitar: I can't tell. There's no quotation marks there.

  "Can I see her?"  Aeka asks.Washu
nods.  "Yes, you can see her, but don't stay to long she needs her rest."
Aeka walks into the room and sits down on the bed next to Sasami.  "Hi
Sasami, how are you feeling?"  Sasami opens her eyes.  "I'm just fine Aeka.
What happened to me, and why do I have a horrible headache?"

>Scimitar:(Aeka) its just your 1st hangover.
>Ksa:(ditto) Why did you let Ryoko give you a drink?

  Aeka giggles.
"You mean you don't remember what happened to you!"

>Rei: Why is Aeka giggling?
>Ksa: I think the stress of life has gotten to her.

  Sasami lookingconfused.
 "No, I can remember going into Washu's subspace lab, then the rest is a
blur."  "Well, from what Washu tells me is you touched something you weren't
supposed to touch."

>Ryoga: Oh god!(nose starts bleeding)
>(Rei hits Ryoga)
>Ksa: And he isn't even a hentai, for crying out loud!

  Sasami sits up in bed.  "Is Washu mad at me?"  Aeka
shacks her head. 

>Ksa: Not just shack, wood shack her head.

 "No, she's not mad at you, but in the future you shouldn't
touch what you don't understand.  Now take some aspirin and go to sleep."

>Scimitar: Thats what Belldandy always tells me to do after Skuld mallets me.

Sasami takes two aspirin with a glass of water and lays down.  Then Aeka
kisses her on the forehead.  Aeka then turns off the lights and leaves the
room closing the door behind her.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Around 1 a.m. Sasami started to whine in pain and speak out loud.

>Ksa: In 'Sammy's Little Secret' she whined. Now she's whining here.
>Rei: Tank Cop must love the sound of Sasami whining.

  "I won't
let you hurt them!"  A strange voice comes from within Sasami.  "You can't
stop me girl, its futile.  I will take your mind, body, and soul by killing
you very soon!"

>Ksa: No prizes for guessing who that is.
>Others: Awww!

  A powerful shock wave comes from Sasami that causes the
glass of water to shatter.

>Ryoga: She must have become Tsunami. Geddit?
>Others: No.
>Ryoga: Shockwave. Tsunami. Geddit?
>Others: Stop talking please.

  Sasami then jumps up in bed drenched in sweat.
Sasami runs down stares to get a dust pan and a broom.  When Ryoko Who just
happened to be fixing a late night snack, saw her.

>Scimitar: I'm Doctor Who, Ryoko Who.

  "Hey Sasami I thought
that you were asleep with a bad headache.

>Rei:(as Ryoko) Thats supposed to me.

  So what are you doing up?"  Sasami
with a tremble in her voice.

>Ksa: Why is he avoiding words like 'said' and 'look'?
>Ryoga: This is the Cop we're talking about! He never made sense.

  "I had a bad dream and must have knocked the
glass of water in my room on the floor, and now the floor is covered with
glass.  I don't want Ryo-Ohki to get glass in her feet when she wakes up in
the morning."  Ryoko puts her snack aside and walks over to her.  "Is that
all, come on kid I'll help you clean up that mess."  "Thanks Ryoko."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sasami's headaches got worse as the days went on and the nightmares got more,
and more intense.

>Ksa: Incoming dark bit!
>Scimitar: Brace yourselves!

  Then one day the nightmare became real.
The others were outside playing ball, when.  "Sasami its me the bad dream of
yours, its time to die!"

>Rei: Who introduces themselves as, 'the bad dream'?

  She looks around but sees no one.  "Where are you,
what do you want?"  "I am Kain, and you are what I want!"  In seconds
Sasami's body erupts in a burst of energy as she screams.

>Scimitar:(as Sasami) Damn vibrator side effects!
>Ryoga:(nostril explodes with blood) GAH!
>Ksa and Rei:(covered in Ryoga's blood) Thanks alot, Scimitar.

  "AAARRRHHH!"  The
force of energy released from her breaks every window in the house at once.

>Ksa: So, Kain turned her into a opera singer. (rimshot. Others do a facefall)

CRASH  Tenchi looks back at the house.  "What the Hell was that!"  Aeka with
a look of fear.  "Oh my God, Sasami's in there!"
They get in the house to find that every room in the house is covered with
glass.  Then they get to Sasami's room to find Ryo-Ohki crying over Sasami,
laying on the ground in a pool of her own blood.

>Ryoga: So what has Tank Cop done to Sasami so far.
>Ksa: Had her screw Rumiya.
>Scimitar: And now killed her.
>Rei:(mock happiness) Great. Can't wait for the next one.

  Aeka grabs Sasami off the
floor and rushes her to Washu's subspace lab.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An hour later, Sasami's body lays dead on a table in Washu's lab.

>Ksa: Boy, that was a subtle way to go.

  While
Washu try's to calm down a hysterical Aeka, Kain takes control of Sasami's
body and stands up.  Washu and Aeka see the body of Sasami rise.

>Rei:(as Aeka) She's alive! ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVEEE!
>Ksa: Note to self. Cancel movie channels in Rei's room.

Washu and Aeka are astonished by what just happened, approach Sasami.  Then
Sasami lifts up her head to show that she is no longer Sasami!

>Scimitar: She became Monica Lewinski?

  Her eyes have
turned to an emerald green color and her voice has changed to sound like
Kain.  Washu and Aeka take a step back.  Aeka asks Sasami what's wrong.
"Sasami what's happened to you, are you ok?"

>Ryoga: OK, so he says what they're going to do, then writes it?
>Ksa: The Cop works in mysterious ways.

  "I'm sorry Sasami can no longer
hear you, she's dead!"

>Scimitar: If you leave your name and address, she'll get back to you.
>Rei: Since when did Kain have a sense of humor?

  "Who are you?"  Aeka demands.  "I am Kain or what's
left of him.  After my last battle I was badly wounded and needed some place
close to the ones who had stopped me to rest, so I changed into that energy
sphere.

>Ksa:(as Kain) I owe Washu for that basketball game!

  Then when Sasami touched me I was able to assimilate her, by taking
her life force and growing in strength."  Washu walks up to Aeka.  "We have
to get out of here now Aeka!"  Kain seeing that they were trying to leave

>Ryoga: He could tell by the way they edged toward the door. 
>That, and Washu said it out loud!

blocked there exit by using his power to pick up a computer and flinging it
against the door.  "Going somewhere are you!"  Washu thinks of another way
out.  "Quick to the transporters (yes, I know how stupid that sounds, but its
all I could think of)!"

>Ksa: My god.
>Rei: A writer who knows something he writes is stupid.
>Scimitar: There is hope.
>Ryoga: A New Hope.
>(Everyone elbows Ryoga)

  Washu turns back to see Aeka looking strait at Kain.
 Kain looks at Aeka and laughs.  "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  How heroic your going
to die for someone that no longer exists!"  Aeka with her power fully
charged.

>Ksa: Tank Cop, there are such things as commas.
>Rei: And words like said, or in the case of the last sentence, 'stood'.

  "Give me back my sister you Asshole!  Or by God I'll..."  "What
kill me, go ahead I'll just find a new host."  Washu grabs Aeka.  "He's
right, she's gone.  We have to go before Kain finds a way to reach full
power."  Aeka takes one last look at her sister then gets to the transpoter
and is beamed outside the house where the others are sitting on the porch.

>Scimitar: So, in the case of an emergency, Washu wanted to get the porch. That's new.

The others run up to her to see if she's ok.  "Aeka where did you come from,
and what's going on?"  Ryoko asks.  Then Aeka yells out.  "KAIN'S BACK AND
HE'S KILLED SASAMI!  WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM THE HOUSE NOW!  RUN,
RRRUUUNNN!"

>Ryoga: Wow. She summed up the whole story.

  They all run, but the only thing that went threw Aeka's mind
was, where's Washu?

>All: bum-bum-BUM!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Washu was setting the transporter to take her out, when Kain, who is stillin
Sasami's body grabs her by the neck and rams her against a wall!  "Now tell
me you witch, how to get my old body back and at full strength, or die!"

>Rei:(as Kain's mom) Young monster, what is the magic word?
>Ksa:(as Kain) Ah Ma do I hafta. Oh, please?

Washu looks at Kain then spits in his face!  "Fuck you!  I'll never helpyou,

>Ksa:(as Washu) And I won't help you either!

you Bastard!  You may have killed Sasami and taken her body, but there's no
way in Hell that I'll never help you!  So go ahead and kill me!"  Kain looks
at her and laughs.

>Rei: I bet you 3000 yen, he'll write 'ha ha ha' next.
>Ryoga: You're on!

  "Ha, ha, ha! 

>Rei: Pay up.
>Ryoga: Damn!

 You don't need to be alive to give me what
I want, I'll just assimilate you and take what I need, just like that little
weak Sasami!"  And with that Kain puts Sasami's hands on Washu's head and a
blue energy, much like lighting leaves Sasami's eyes and enters Washu's.
Then Washu is assimilated.  Washu screams out in pain.  "AAAARRRRHHHH!"

>Scimitar: New way to tell a story. Say what happens, then act it out.
>Ksa: We are really running out of good riffs.

  Then
Sasami's body falls lifeless on the ground.  The Kain, now in Washu's body
speaks.  "No more need for that lifeless shell anymore.  Now onto the remake
of my old body."  Kain using Washu's mind starts to create a new body.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yosho looks out the window of Mihoshi and Kiyone's apartment and thinks of
what has happened up till now.

>Ksa: Yosho! I'm shocked!
>Scimitar: I'm confounded!
>Rei: I'm flabbergasted!
>Ryoga: I have no idea what to say!

It has been three days since Kain killed Sasami and maybe Washu as well.  We
are all staying at Mihoshi and Kiyone's apartment.  Aeka has not said a word
since we got here, I think the shock of what happened to her sister has
caused her to break down.

>Ksa:(as mechanic) Well, ya gotta change her oil every 300 years, or this'll keep happenin'.

Ryoko is all primed for an attack on Kain.  I have never in all the years
that I have known her, I have never seen her so sad!  Oh she hides it behind
anger and rage, but I know that she misses Sasami, just as much as we alldo.

>Ksa: Damn it, man! Would it help to proof-read once in awhile?

Ryo-Ohki has not stopped crying since we arrived here.  She won't even eat a
carrot.

>Scimitar: Now THAT'S shock.

  She just sits in the corner with a picture of Sasami and crys.
Mihosi and Kiyone have been trying to call the rest of the Galaxy Police for
assistance, but can't get a transmission out.  We can't even leave the
planet!  There's some kind of energy field surrounding the planet.  It must
be Kain, he doesn't want use to leave.
Tenchi has told me about Kain.  How it was Kain who caused my daughterAchika
to die at a young age.

>Rei: He screwed up Achika's name.
>Ksa: He killed Sasami, and now can't spell Achika right?!
>Ryoga: We will avenge them for this insult!

  I will avenge Achika, Sasami and Washu by sending
this demon strait to Hell!Thank God my son-in-law is out of town on business.
Suddenly, there is a bright flash in the apartment and the whole group was
transported to the front of the house!

>Ksa: And Kain didn't do this before, because...?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kain, who is still in Washu's body looks at every one.  "Well, well.  Niceof
you all to come, this will make killing you all so much easier!"  Aeka looks
right at Kain.  "What do you want Kain?"

>Rei:(singing) I'll tell ya what I want what I really, really want!
>(Ksa's celphone rings)
>Ksa:(to phone) Hello? Oh hi Priss. How'd you..? Yeah, I'll tell her.(hangs up 
>and looks at Rei)Priss says stop with the Spice Girls riff.

  "I want you all to witness the
rebirth of my old self before I kill you all!"
Just then the ground begins to shack

>Ksa: Metal shack that is.

 and the house explodes!  KA-BOOM  Thena

>Scimitar: It'th Thena, the Warrior Princeth!

strange black mass starts to cover Washu's body.

>Rei: Darn those wacky Masses.

  Then a few seconds later
its over.  The black mass starts to form into the body of Kain.  "Ha, ha,ha!
 I won't need this anymore."  Washu's body is pushed out of Kain, then lays
dead on the ground.  "Now you die!"
The others stand ready to fight to the death.

>Ksa:(as Kain) Wait a sec, I need an hour or so of plot before I can fight.

  Within seconds Tenchi, Ryoko,
and Aeka have switched into full battle suits, just like the last time they
fought Kain.  Then Yosho and Tenchi activated there Light Hawk Swords,

>Ksa:(pulls out megaphone) That's it!
>Rei: You stole that from Peter.
>Scimitar: Everyone, cover your ears!
>Ksa:(through megaphone) FIRSTLY, THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS DON'T EXIST IN THAT VERSION!
>SECOND, YOSHO DOESN'T HAVE LIGHT HAWK WINGS!
>Scimitar:(cupping ears) Not again.

 while
Ryoko powers up her sword, and Aeak readies her power.  Mihoshi and Kiyone
ready themselves too.
Then they attack, first Ryoko with a few energy blast's, then Aeka with a
force field boll

>Rei: Welcome to the Super Force Field Boll. Playing today, the Tenchi gang,
>and the Kain maulers.

 intent on crushing Kain.  But it didn't work.  Kain wasable

>Ksa: Or Kain Wasabi.
>Rei: Or Kain Wallabi.
>Scimitar: Or Kain Wakazi.
>Ryoga: Or Kain Platapus. (Everyone glares at Ryoga) Sorry.

to rip threw the force field like it wasn't there, and the energy blast's
didn't even faze him.
Aeka is knocked to the ground by the force field exploding.  Kain then try's
to smash her but Tenchi jumped in and got her out just in time.  "Are you
ok?"  Tenchi asks.  "Yes, but he's to strong, we can't win."  Tenchi looksat

>Ksa: Or Tenchi Spacesat.
>Scimitar:(British accent) Don't start that again.

Aeka then looks at Kain.  He sees that the others are doing there best buthe
knows its not going to be enough.  Then he gets an idea.  He take one last
look at Aeka.  "Aeka remember that what I do, I do for the world!  I will
always love you."

>Ksa: What about Ryoko! You insensitive bastard!
>Scimitar:(to you viewers) He's a big Ryoko fan.

  With that Tenchi kisses Aeka then runs at Kain, cuts a
hole in his stomach to get inside Kain and then activates his Light HawkWings!

>Ryoga: Weren't they already on?
>Ksa: Testing, 1, 2. Are these things on?

Kain's body starts to glow blue with energy released by Tenchi, its morethen
Kain can take.  "NNNOOO!  I can't end like this, not like this!"  The mighty
Kain explodes in a burst of energy so bright it can be seen from space!
KKKAAA-BBBOOOOOOMMM
After the dust clears, there is nothing left but an empty creator and
Tenchi's Light Hawk Key.
Aeka looks at the creator that is left where Kain and Tenchi once stood.  She
runs to the crater, kneels down, grabs the Key and crys.  "TENCHI NNNOOO!
OH GOD NO NOT YOU TOO, OH PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!"  She just sits there on her
knees with the Key in her hand and crys.  While the others join her.
Its over Kain is dead, but at what price.(END)

>Ksa: That was quick.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you enjoyed reading my story, I just love Kain.

>Scimitar: We noticed.
>Ksa: He was the only one remotly close to being in character.

  Yes, I like dark
Fanfics I think that they are the best kind of story.

>Rei: They are better with a believable plot.

  Please read my series
coming out in two or three months.

>Ksa: And we'll be there too! ^_^

  Please E-mail me what you think about my
story, I want your opinions.

>Ksa: And now, my passage separater.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE REVIEWER'S COMMENTS:

KSA: It's not that hard. Just read the story over to check the spelling. There's nothing to it.
SCIMITAR: You have just tramatized me with Sasami's death. First, you make her screw a bird,
then kill her? Jeez.
REI: This would have worked if you gave it a decent plot.
RYOGA: Pal, you are messed up.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, you probably think I did this just to annoy Tank Cop.
Thats what I planned till I read this.
This, in all honesty, deserves to be MSTed.
Later! ^_~
