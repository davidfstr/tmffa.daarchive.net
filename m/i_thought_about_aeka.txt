Synopsis:
    New lyrics to "Army", by Ben Folds Five, from Tenchi's point of view;
the tone is similar to the original song.

>>and now, the Glorious Work itself...

Well I thought about Aeka
Dad said "Son, you're fucking high"
"Ryoko's SO much hotter
Why don't you give her a try"

Took his advice
Talked to the demon
She was radiant with glee
She'd been waiting all this time for me to
Choose her as the only one for me

Aeka's upset today

But of course it didn't work out
We had broken up next week
But at that time princess aeka
Still wouldn't talk to me
Of course Mihoshi and Kiyone
Were on earth where they had flown
On Yagami, but Kiyone seemed to distant
And Mihoshi...well, better left alone

Aeka's upset today

Welllll now I didn't know who
IIIIIII could turn to
Welllll there's always Washuuuu      (Nah)

Now with all of this behind me
The girls who once defined me
Have left; the stars remind me
Of the way things are and how they could have been

I thought about...Aeka

As mentioned before, both the music and characters used in this fic are not
property of Karlmarks.  Since it'll be fairly easy to find the owners of the
Tenchi Muyo from a TM FF page, I'll give you a link to Ben Fold Five:

Like it?  Hate it?  Hate me?  Please email!  Specific comments would be
nice, but just a "Good song/Bad song" would suffice.
