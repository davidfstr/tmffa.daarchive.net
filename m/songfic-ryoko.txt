Ryoko
Munkey boy (Chino_M_65@yahoo.com)

this poem was originally written
to a girlfriend (who reminds me very much
of Ryoko) that was killed in an accident
about a year ago.

this isn't the synopsis or anything but i wrote this about 3 months
ago while tenchi universe was on tv. and i started to notice how 
much ryoko and shanna were alike. so to make a long story short
i consider this to be as much of a poem to ryoko as i do shanna.


 
your hair is so beautiful
your eyes are enchanting
they echo your beauty
they echo your soul
seeing you is like watching an angel
from deep within a hole
you are the only thing i can see
you are the only one who can help me
there is not a moment that goes by 
when i dont think of you
and there is not a moment that goes by 
that i dont cry over you
for you are the one i love
please dont listen to me
i mean nothing to you
i am worthless
i am scum
dont feel sorry for me
i do enough of that myself
but your eyes
they give me hope
for when i look into them
they echo your beauty 
they echo your soul.
