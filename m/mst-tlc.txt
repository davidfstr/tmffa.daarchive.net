A portal opens and Kat Goddess is dropped into a movie theater with no doors 
or means of escape, sticky floors, and 5 seats.
Kat Goddess: I, Kat Goddess, has chosen to MST this stupid piece of filth. 
Mwahahahahahahahahahahahah!! Ryoko, come to me and help me bash this fanfic 
into oblivion! *Ryoko is dropped out of the portal. *
Ryoko: Ow! Dammit that hurt.But we need Tenchi and Ayeka to share this burden 
with us.
*Ayeka and Tenchi are dropped flat on their asses onto the sticky floor. *
Tenchi: Dammit how did we get here?
Ayeka: My royal Ass hurts.
Ryoko: This psychopathic Bakenoko brought us here to MST a fanfic.
Kat Goddess: Yes, you must share the burden of MSTing this fanfic with me 
then I will eat you if I choose to do so.
All: wha.?
Suddenly, Washu is dropped on her face, upon the sticky mess we call a floor.
Washu: How the fuck did I get here?
Ryoko: This psychopathic Bakenoko brought us here to MST a fanfic. '-.-
Washu: oh.right.
*The movie reel starts to scroll and all sit down * 
Ryoko: this better be good.
Ayeka: if it's being MSTed, it can't be.
Tenchi: Ain't that the truth.
Washu: I'm gonna go to sleep now.
*MST plays *
