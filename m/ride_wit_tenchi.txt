Here is another one of my ubiquitous
song parodies. I hope no one
else has done it because reading the
same songs over and over again
is a bit boring. For
instance, 'The Real Slim Shady'
had been done to death (although my
complimets to Ian Sagat
who did a brilliant version).
So, lie back aand enjoy my parody
of Nelly's 'Ride Wit Me', which
dispite it's obscenity and the 
really stupid use of racially
insulting words (and some people
tell me a black person using
the word 'Nigga' is okay- dumb ass fools)
is one of my favourites.

Ride Wit Tenchi
Tenchi F/ Jurai Spud 

Where The girls at? 
Where The girls at? 
Where The girls at? 
Where The girls at? 

Tenchi: Yeah, right...

If you wanna go and take a side wit me
Four women in the back, which one will it be? 
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna fly the sky Wit Me 
With Aeka getting high with her PVC
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

In the summer in the mornin' time, singin' rhymes
Walkin' round breakin the seal on the old shrine
Runnin' tryin to see whats behind me cos I think she the one's
(She's the one) 
She can be a princess into whip and stuff
Or green haired space pirate walkin' in the buff
But As Long As You A Licky Trickey Alien Girl 
You Know That It's Fun
(Know That It's Fun) 
I see some girls comin' down on me from space now
Mabye three or four
Sayin' they were aliens who wanted love and much more
So why Tenchi, can't we go? How could I tell Ryoko so?
It would break the other girls hearts if I go
But
I like the colour of your hair
And I like the skimpy clothes you wear
I like the way your all super-powered out there
Now Demons and Pirates can't give me a scare

If you wanna ride with Tenchi Masaki
And Ryoko with clothes off showing double D 
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna help guide AIC
And Pioneer, write a fic which helps them see
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

Universe, Shin Tenchi, specials- bring Muyo! back
But Pioneer they said they got no dough to finance a contract
They should listen to the fans- fact: It's annoying so stop dat
When the show's the very best,no execs should argue wit dat
Watch Me as Toonami makes it real strange			       
Watch That Story arc Change, Everytime Aeka whips chains	
I feel tricked now
Makin' A Livin of fan fics instead of chicks now
I Got the title of the 'lord'
Get a whip if I don't put it in mah name now
Damn it, stop changin now
Run the OAV- their still great, now  
I Feel The Same Now (come On), The fans Complain Now (no More) 
Damn I'm the man though,In and Out my own show
I'm Gettin Pages from the new G.P., Kiyone Makibi. 
Tellin me bout a contract up at AIC
And Can I Make It? God damn , I wanna do the Next Jam
Fightin' gods, third seriese, hittin on Mihoshi-Chan

If you wanna climb that Jurian tree
Then flip your light hawk and ask Tsunami
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna help guide AIC
And Pioneer, write a fic which helps them see
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If you wanna write a fic with me
Then read my others like 'I wanna see'
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna see some OAV
Then try to get them to do series three
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

[Verse 3] 
Light Hawk -- Yo, I found out Somethin I Didn't Know 
And then came the trouble in summer
You Won't Believe How Many People, started at mah door
And tried to kill the girl with the tail-a
And now the same grey-haired bitch is askin' me for a go
And I'm sayin' try again later
But Tenchi when will they do the next OAV show?
Don't know (what's wit AIC?) Dey'll never seal the deal!
Hey Yo, now that I'm Jurai though, and I can fly low
Knights wanna know how so, why I got mah own show
It's gettin dull as wood, Pioneer needs to make good
Do it if you could-  Tenchi would, and you should
We be them butt kickers, wishin we was kissers
Covered in fan stickers, girls throw in their knickers
Girls in jail and me showin' down
With Kagato, tellin me he can go pound for pound
And If Miho wanna...trip, then she trip over this
So If Ryoko wanna...block, then keep sockin' like this
And If Aeka wanna...whip, we can give her a kiss
Sesami wanna see the man,well then there's a plot twist
Girls Talk, Tenchi listen; Tenchi Talk, Girlies hit him
When I fight fly villians; I win, by intervention
See the sword and the swish, Kinights swearin' or the wish
They could have a show like this-Come on girls, let's go finish 

If you want universe and Muyo! In da week
The only way you'll see it is with Toonami
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna write a little MST
On Kiyone getting jiggy with Mihsohi
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If you do a fanart wit me
Then just don't any sexy pics of Sesami
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna see some OAV
Then try to get them to do series three
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

Hey, Must Be The Women! 
Hey, Must Be The Women! 
Hey, Must Be The Women!
Hey, Must Be The Women!  

If you wanna go and take a side wit me
Four women in the back, which one will it be? 
Oh Why Do I Watch dat show? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

If You Wanna fly the sky Wit Me 
With Aeka getting high with her PVC
Oh Why Must I Feel This low? 
Hey, Must Be The Women!

END

Well, that took a loooong time.
I hope you enjoyed reading it
as much as I enjoyed writing it,
because then I can sleep easy 
again. That bloody tune was going
through my head three nights in a row
before I figured out all the rhymes.
Sorry about the mention
of one of my own fics- it's very
bad form, I know.
Still, any feedback is greatly 
appreciated- but I'm looking for
good mostly (well, I work 
hard on these things!) and if
it's bad please don't waste your e-mail
on me. I'm not worth it.
