<JS>  Hello again, and welcome to Norad III, the MSTing Battlecruiser.  
As always, I do not own these characters, except for myself, and of 
course I don't own any characters in the MSTed MST, or the MSTed fic.  
Megaman X  belongs to Capcom, Washu Hibiki belongs to Pioneer, Meis 
Triumph belongs to Atlus and Red Company, Samus Aran belongs to 
Nintendo, and Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines Third Company and 
Warhammer 40K belongs to Games Workshop.  No offense to the MSTer that I 
am MSTing for using their characters a few times.  Also, my spellcheck 
is broken, so there may be a few mistakes.  You will have to read my 
last MSTs to get some of the jokes in this one.  And lastly, I encourage 
anyone who is interested in comedy, to buy a copy of The Reduced 
Shakespeare and Co. videotape.  It is absolutely hilarious!

With that said, on to the descriptions of our heros, and then to the MST 
of an MST.

NEVER FORGET 9-11-01

These are the tales of the crew of the Terran Battlecruiser Norad III.  
They were trapped there by Dr. Wily, who forces them to read bad 
fanfiction.

<JS>  And, just to give you an idea of what we look like, here are some 
descriptions.

JS:  A seventeen-year-old kid with a somewhat muscular build, pretty 
fast, and tall.  Bald because of an incurable disease, and proud of it!  
Armed with only his fists and a broadsword.  Black glasses, a South Park 
hat, and black sweatpants.  Also wearing a grey shirt that says, "Beer:  
Helping ugly people have sex since 1862"

Megaman X:  Last robot created by Dr. Light before his death.  Leads the 
Maverick Hunters fourth unit, as Captain.  Can interchange armor parts, 
and use a variety of weapons.  Wearing Gaea Armor, a grey-and-white 
super-dense armor that is slow(But who needs speed when you're sitting 
inside a theater?) but very protective.  Can be hit with a large amount 
of punishment before any serious damage.  Has an arm cannon called the 
X-Buster.  For this time around, armed with the weapons from Megaman X5.

Samus Aran:  A bounty hunter from deep into the galaxy, her family was 
killed in a space pirate attack.  Wears a special suit of Power Armor 
that was built by the Chozo, or Bird-People. This version of the armor 
is the Varia suit.  Armed with an array of different energy beams, that 
can charge up to become more powerful.  Has optical sensors built into 
helmet for better sight in the dark.  Hates all perverts, especially 
Meis.

Washu Hibiki:  One of three Goddesses:  Herself, Tokimi, and Tsunami.  
Self-proclaimed "Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe", and nobody 
except maybe Yume has the brains to contest that title.  Wears her old 
Science Acadamy clothes, and is armed with her Holoputer.  She is 
20,000+ years old.  Also has a small forcefield generator, because of a 
certain pervert's continued insults toward a certain purple-haired 
princess.  Has her hair inside a hat, so that it doesn't catch on fire 
in case anyone decides to use fire weapons.

Meis Triumph:  Possibly the luckiest guy in the world.  He has twelve 
beautiful women all falling for him, and he isn't afraid to date them 
all!  Wears a cloak, white pants, and a brown shirt.  Has his trusty W-
Blade at his side, and also can call upon many powerful beasts of magic 
to aid him. (For example, if Samus was trying to kill him again, he 
would summon Aquoon, the water dragon.) Probably the biggest pervert in 
the world, and proud of it.  Has a high threshold for pain, possibly 
because of the constant beatings he gets from the other MSTers.

Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company:  From the year 
40,000, is second-in-command of one of the most powerful Space Marine 
Chapters in the galaxy, the Ultramarines. They are one of humanity's 
greatest achievements.  He is eight feet tall, wears a suit of 
Terminator Armor.(Very large, bulky suit of all-enclosing mechanical 
armor, increases senses and reaction time one-hundred-fold.)  Armed with 
a Storm Bolter(Huge double-barreled gun with detonate-on-contact 
ammunition) and a glowing blue Power Sword.(four foot long blade, with a 
matter-disrupting field around it, basically allows him to cleave 
through anything) Has three hearts, four lungs, can spit acid, see in 
the dark, hear a pin drop from a thousand paces, run at speeds of up to 
thirty miles per hour, and do just about anything else you can think of.  
Also wearing an Iron Halo, which gives him a powerful forcefield.

-Inside Norad III's rec room-
<JS>(Sparring with Invictus, who has exchanged his power sword with a 
broadsword) God Damn you're fast!
<Invictus>  How do you think I could have survived for four hundred 
years if I wasn't this quick?
<JS>  Good point.(Gets broadsword knocked out of his hands) Crap!
<Invictus> Nobody can best a Space Marine in close combat!  You lose!
<Washu>  I will have to do some tests on Invictus later.
<Samus> ^__^; At least get his permission before you do.
<Washu>  Fine, fine.
<JS>  That's the twelfth time you've beaten me!
<Invictus>  Well, what do you expect?  You're just a normal human, and I 
am a genetically-enhanced superhuman!
<X> Brag, brag, brag.  Is that all he ever does?
<Samus>  No, he also says some disgusting comments and gets booted up 
into the rafters.
<X>  =__= oh, yeah.
-----Incoming Transmission-----
<Wily>  It's time for another MST!
<ALL> *Groan*
<Wily>  This time, you're MSTing an MST of a non-lemon!
<JS>  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're MSTing someone else's MST?
<Wily>  Yep.  I decided that I should give you something a little 
milder, but not too easy.  So, as normal, get your snacks while you can, 
'cause once you go in, you can't come out until it's done.
(All grab snacks and go inside)

<JS>(With a mouthful of Sour Patch Kids) Tho, what ith thith one called?
<Washu> (Eating a Twinkie) It's called, "No Need for Twelve More", 
whatever that means.
<Samus> (Eating a Ho-ho) Maybe it's about the twelve days of christmas.

"No need for twelve more"-MSTed

<JS>  MSTed, and then MSTed again!

(I don't own anything, if you sue me you won't get anything, the 
original fic was by "Tia~Sailor Nova". 

<Washu>  I don't recall there being one called that.
<Meis>  It's a name some fangirl came up with.

I am too lazy for a story. 

<JS> (Reduced Shakespeare and Co.) "Right, we'll cut that and go 
straight to the good part."
<All but JS> O__o;
<Invictus>  Um, what good part?
<JS>  I dunno.

Crono (me), Vegita, and Magus are back in yet another MST.)

<Samus>  Gee, think this guy likes Crono Trigger?
<Washu>  And here I was, thinking Crono was a mute!
<JS>  Crono Cross SUCKED!
<Invictus> That was out of the blue.
<JS>  Well?  It had nothing to do with the original story.

By: Shawntia Key

<X>  Where's the lock you put her into?
<Samus>  Lame.

Chapter 1:

<Invictus>  Yes, I am from the Ultramarines, one of the first Chapters 
of Space Marines.
<JS>  Not that kind of chapter, you idiot.

It's another day in the Masoki home.

<JS> AHAHAHAHAHA!  Oh, that's a good one!
<Washu>  I wonder where the Masoki residence is.  It is obviously 
nothing like the MASAKI residence.
<Invictus>  Well, there's your bad story beginning.
<X>  What do you mean?
<JS>  "It's another day in the Masaki home."  One of the most common 
beginnings.  Of course, I'm not one to talk, because in my story, 
Warhammer 40K Muyo, that's how it starts out too.  But then it changes 
dramatically.
<Meis>  Stop plugging your own fics!

<Crono: No kidding.

<Magus: Masoki?

<JS>  Heeheehee..

<Vegeta: If we point out spelling and grammar mistakes this will be long 
as hell.

<JS>  Well, I guess this is going to be long as hell, because being the 
nitpicker that I am, I'm gonna have to pick out EVERY typo!

The birds are singing, Sasami and Myuka

<JS>  Evil clone of Mayuka!
<Samus>  I thought you were a fan of Ksa and Peter.
<JS>  But I am!
<Samus>  Then stop stealing their material!

<Crono: who the fuck is Myuka?

<Washu>  Watch your mouth, or I'll turn you into a water sprite!

<Vegeta: I saw a lepruchuan and he told me to BURN things.

<JS>  No, no, no, no, NO.  It goes like this: (Ralph Wiggum)  I have a 
leprechaun friend, and he tells me to BURN things!

are playing in the yard. Ryoko's sleeping on the roof,

<Crono: why on the roof?

<Washu>  She sometimes hangs out there, you know.

Ayeka's watching a sop opera on the television,

<Samus>  Hey Invictus, what exactly is a sop?
<Invictus>  Ummmm, maybe some kind of mop?

<Magus: sop operas kick ass.

<JS>  Will wonders never cease!
<X>  What do you mean?
<JS>  An MSTer has been infected with the bad spelling virus, 
transferred from the author!
<Meis> (Dr. Evil) Riiiiiiiight.

Washue's 

<All>  Bless you.

down in her lab.  Tenchi's was pulling out carrots with Ryo-ohiki.

<JS>  Justice friends, ASSEEEEEMBLE!!  White Tiger!  Vaaaaaaalhallen!  
Speeding Bullet!  Miss-Spell!  Capital G!   SAM!--R!--I!  Phan-Tone!  
The Infraggable Krunk!  Major Glory!  Aaaaand, Ohiki.I mean, TIKI TORCH!
<All but JS> O__o;;;;;;  Okaaaay..

<Vegeta: Ryo-oh-ki IS about the size of a carrot!

<Meis>  True dat.

Everything just seems fine, well shored of. 

<JS>  (Old hick)  Everyshing jusht sheems fine, well shored of, shonny.

"Sasami, what's that big shinny thing in the sky?"

<X>  Not by the hairs on my shinny shin shin!
<Samus>  It's chin, you moron.  And you don't have hair.  You're a 
robot, remember?
<X>  I.  AM.  NOT.  A.  ROBOT!!!!!  TRI-THUNDER!  *KRRRZZZZZZZAAAAAAAP!*
<Samus> (Twitching)  Ouch.

<Crono: a big shinny thing.I wonder.

Myuka asked jumping off her swing.

<Crono: WHO THE FUCK IS MYUKA? Nevermind.

<Washu>  This is your last warning!

"I don't know, I'll go get Ayeka." Sasami yelled running inside the 
house. "Ayeka, Ayeka, something really big's in the sky."

<Crono: (as Sasami) It looks like a giant.

<JS>  A giant WHAT?

Sasami yelled pulling her sister to the door. 

<JS> (Ayeka, being pulled by Sasami)  Sasami, I never knew you were this 
strong!

"Calm down Sasami I see it. I'll go ask Washu 

<Washu>  NOW he gets my name right.

to take a look at it."

<Magus: no you won't. You just think you will.

<Invictus>  Okay, that didn't even make sense.

Ayeka said pulling away from her little sister. When Ayeka got to the 
door she knocked on it very softly.

<Vegita; there is a damn planet's worth of space in there and you expect 
for her to hear a soft knock?!

<Washu>  Actually, it's more like FOUR planets worth.

After four times of knocking she walked inside. When she entered the 
room it was completely dark only showing a bit of light from a far 
corner. Ayeka followed the light until she was inside a room she had 
never witness before.

<Crono: witness? Did the room commit a crime?

<JS>  HEY!  I was going to say that!

When she was inside completely she saw Washu sitting on top of a little 
table. 

<Washu>  Oh, come on!  I would be sitting on a cushion, or something!

Ayeka walked closer to her and began to call her name when she saw 
someone's hands around her. 

<Washu>  I hope it's Tenchi's!

"What is she doing?"

<ALL>  We don't want to know.

<Crono: you don't want to know.

<JS>  Exactly!

Ayeka wondered as she listened closely. After a couple of moments of 
waiting she began to hear a little laughing and kissing.

<Meis>  I thought Wily said this wasn't going to be a lemon.
<Samus>  You retard!  Just because there is kissing in it, doesn't mean 
it's a lemon!
<Meis>  Well, whenever me and Sodina kiss, it always winds up like that.
<All but Meis>  =__=  We REALLY didn't need to know that!

<Magus: She heard kissing? They must have been kissing loudly.

<Invictus>  SMACK!  SMACK!

<Vegita: Couldn't she SEE Washu?

"Who is she kissing? What if she's kissing Lord Tenchi? What if they had 
a secret relationship and I'm the first to find out? 

<JS> (As Ayeka)  And why the heck am I asking all these questions?

I can't let this continue."

<Crono: then something zany happened because something zany ALWAYS 
happens.

Ayeka thought as she jumped up from her hidden spot

<Washu>----In the doorway.

<Crono: where was she hiding?

<Washu>  I just said the doorway!

and yelled. "Washue 

<Washu>  There they go with misspelling my name again!

<JS>  I think it's funny when people misspell something, then spell it 
correctly, then misspell it again!

your just like your monstrous daughter 

<JS>  (Ryoko)  ROOOOOOAAAAARRRR!!!!!
<Meis>(Badly dubbed japanese movie)  OH NO!  GODZILLA!(A red beam comes 
out of nowhere and fries Meis)  *SHEEN* *FOOOM*
<Meis> (Toasty) OUCH.

kissing on Lord Tenchi. Well, I know your secret and it's all going to 
stop right here right now." Ayeka yelled pulling Washue away. 

<Washu>  I AM NOT A SHOE!

But when Ayeka pulled Washue away it wasn't Tenchi she was kissing. It 
was Tenchi's grandfather Yosho!

(ALL throw up)
<ALL>(Recovering) DISGUSTING!  REPULSIVE!  HORRIBLY OUT OF CHARACTER!
<Invictus>  And isn't he a green dinosaur?
<JS>  That's YOSHI, you idiot.

<Magus: eeeeewwwwww.

<JS>  You took the words out of my mouth.
<Samus>  (Points to the floor) That's not all he took out.
<JS>  HEY!  So that's where my sock went!
<All but JS>  ^__^;

"Grandpa?" Ayeka screamed jumping back.

<X>  I do believe Yosho is her brother, not her grandfather.
<Washu>  I do believe you're right.

<Vegita: Yosho isn't her grandpa.

<Invictus>  I do believe we just said that.

"I guess she knows are secret now, dear." 

<JS>  (To author)  And I guess you DON'T know that you used "are" 
instead of "our".

Yosho said hugging Washu close.

<Magus: again, eeeeewwwwww.

<JS>  I feel me and him have a connection, somehow.
<X>  Why do you say that?
<JS>  Because we both think that is gross.
<Washu>  Then I guess everyone in the world has a connection to him, 
because we ALL think that is gross.

"You're telling me that you and her are... are.... 

<JS> (Pirate) Arrr, arrr, avast ye mateys!
<All but JS> Aye aye, cap'n!
<JS.  And swab the poop deck!
<All but JS>  We're not touchin' it, cap'n!

a couple!" Ayeka yelled in between laughs. 

<Samus>  I'd laugh too if I caught one of my friends kissing some old 
geezer. (Logs)  Aw, what did I say now? 
*KRRRZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*
<Washu>  (Extra crispy) I think it was when you insulted her brother.  
And why the hell didn't my forcefield work?
<Ayeka>  That's exactly right, Washu!
<JS>  AAAARRRGH!  WHERE IS SHE?  I'LL KILL THAT LITTLE FLAT-CHESTED 
BIMBO!  (LOGS)  CRAAAAP!  *KRRRZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAP!*

"I guess it's time to tell everyone about us!" Washu said kissing Yosho 
on the lips soft.

<Washu>  Please, don't.

<Magus: (throws up)

Crono: O_o I aint cleaning that up.

<JS> (Crono) And I ain't usin' apostraphes, either!

"Ayeka if you don't mind me asking but why are you in my lab anyway?"

<Invictus> (Ayeka)  Oh, just spying on you while you make out with my 
brother.  (More logs)  *KRRRZZZZAAAAAAP!*
<Samus> (Crispy fried PUNK)  Maybe we should lay off the Ayeka jokes?
<All>  Good idea.

Vegeta: I LIKE CHEESE.

<X> O__o;;  What the hell?!
<Washu>  They say stuff like that through the whole thing.

Washue 

<Washu>  GODDAMMIT I'M NOT A SHOE!
<JS>  Calm down!

asked pulling away from Yosho. "Well there's this object headed our way 
and I want you to do a reading on it or at least tell us what it is." 
Ayeka said still laughing a bit. "I already did a reading on it and it 
should fall in about 5 months."

<Meis>  There's probably some big event happening in five months, 
besides the thing falling, knowing this story.

<Crono: It's a giant dick.

<Washu>  WATER SPRITE TIME!  (Tries to turn Crono into a water sprite, 
but the water sprite ray bounces off an invisible forcefield)  HEY!
<Wily>  Sorry, no turning the other MSTing team into water sprites. 
(Crono sticks his toungue out at Washu)
<Washu>  Why you little bastard!

Washue said pushing Ayeka out of her lab. "Now if you don't mind!"

<Crono: we are going to have old folk sex!

<JS> (Throws up) YUCK!
<Washu>  It's okay, it's just a fic.

<Magus: (throws up again)

<Crono: O_o I forgot. Sorry, Magus.

Washue said pushing her out completely. "No don't mind at all get your 
thing on."

<Invictus>  She would never say that!

<Magus: (throws up)

Ayeka laughed. "Good!" Washue said shutting her door. Ayeka felt her 
self laugh again and jumped onto the coach.

<X>  And then she rode it away into the night!

<Crono: why does she need to feel herself laugh?

"Why are you so happy?" a voice from over her asked. Ayeka looked up and 
saw Ryoko the green-eyed space pirate looking down at her.

<ALL look at Washu>  O__O;;;;;;;;;;;  What did you do to Ryoko?!
<Washu>  "Green-eyed space pirate"?  I don't know what this guy is 
talking about!   He has probably never seen an episode of Tenchi 
Muyo/Universe or even the horribly done Shin Tenchi Muyo!  HER EYES ARE 
AMBER, YOU STUPID AUTHOR!

<Vegeta: Now a Ryoko/Ayeka yuri. Perfect.

<Meis>  ^__^ YAY!
<Samus>  HENTAI!  *WA-BAMMM!*
<Meis>  OUCHIES!

"It's none of your business, now go and get away from me." Ayeka yelled 
taking the romote 

<X>  What the hell's a romote?
<JS>  It's a typo, that's what it is.

from her hand. "Now, maybe I'm seeing this all wrong but I was here 
before you princess."

<Crono: when will this hellish fic end?

<Vegeta: when YOU stop making fun of it, dolt!

<JS>  Dolt?  What kind of insult is that?  Now, something like, 'flaming 
idiot', 'God damn mother f&%$ing son of a b&#$h', or 'piece of shiQUACK 
QUACK QUACK!  QUACK?  QUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACK!
<Washu>  You're a bad boy for using such naughty language! 
<JS> (folds flippers)  Quack.

(Crono kicks Vegeta's ass)

<Invictus>  Now why hurt a poor donkey?

<Vegeta: damn god power.

Ryoko yelled taking the remote from Ayeka.

<X>  Hey, he spelled 'remote' right this time!

<Magus: I think I am done vomiting. Why is she yelling?

"What?" Ayeka yelled jumping to her feet. Before the girls began their 
fight for the television Tenchi walked in with six other boys.

<Vegeta: It's a Tenchi yaoi. Even worse.

<ALL>  O__O;;;; Uh-oh.

Chapter 2:

"Tenchi how could you live her with all these girls my hormones would go 
crazy if I was you."

<Invictus> (Comma nazi)  No commas for you!

<Crono: why bother to ask? Just beat the shit out of him.

<Washu>  I wish I could change him into a water sprite.

a boy with long white hair 

<Meis>  Oh God, is this a DBZ crossover?

said looking at Ryoko. "Tenchi who are these people?" Ayeka asked 
looking at all of them. Just than Sasami and Mayuka

<Vegeta: WHO THE FUCK IS MAYUKA?! ( blows up a galaxy in a fit of rage)

<X>  I knew Vegita was powerful, but I don't think he's THAT powerful.

walked in. "Wow you have girls around my age too." A short cute 14-year-
old boy with blonde hair said looking at Sasami and Mayuka. "Tenchi?" 
Ryoko asked looking

<Magus: groping

<Invictus>  Y'know, she's probably doing just that.

<Crono; that's not something I expected to hear from you.

at him. "Oh! These are my friends. They will be staying her with us for 
a while. But don't worry they are sleeping in a little house they made 
down in the yard.

<Samus> (Tenchi)  Yeah, they'e a bunch of carpenters, that's why they 
built that house so fast

<Crono: the outhouse?

They can also cook for themselves."

<Vegeta: They don't need a nine year old slave to do all the 
housekeeping.

<JS> QUACK QUACK,QUACK! [Preach on, brother!] QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK? 
[And Washu, please change me back!]
<Washu>  Oh, fine.

Tenchi said smiling. "It's a shame we have to miss Sasami's wonderful 
cooking. Tenchi told me so much about it."

<Crono: he is SO raping Sasami.

<All look at JS, who is glowing red> 
O__O;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;
<JS> (Gutteral bestial voice) Must.control...urge to..KILL!  
RAAAAARRRGH!
<All>  O__O;;;  Oh boy.  (JS transforms into a twenty-foot-tall, four-
winged, six-armed creature with a weapon of destruction in each hand.  
Silver-colored armor forms around his body, and his head forms two 
horns, fire red hair, and a mouth full of fangs.  His skin turns black, 
then starts to crack open, and lava begins to seep into the cracks.  
Some of the skin forms into huge metal razor-spikes, and three spike-
tipped tails emerge from his back.)
<Meis>  WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING?
<JS beast> (Booming voice) I AM BELARIUS,  KILLER OF PEDOPHILES!  
WHENEVER I HEAR THE WORDS "RAPE", OR "SEX" IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS 
"SASAMI", I APPEAR!
<All but Belarius> (look at Washu)  Did you do this?
<Washu> (Sheepishly)  Hee hee...yes, I did this.  JS was complaining 
about how each of us had some sort of superpower, and wanted one of his 
own.
<Belarius>  THAT IS CORRECT.  MY ALTER-EGO WAS FEELING A BIT INADEQUATE, 
AND WANTED TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL, TOO.
<All but Belarius and Washu> (look at Washu)  So you did THIS?!
<Washu>  Well, yeah, Isn't he amazing, though?
<X>  Um, guys...
<Meis, Invictus, and Samus> Be quiet, we're yelling at Washu!
<X>  But guys...
<Same>  What did we just tell you?!
<X>  But the lava that's seeping out of Belarius is melting through the 
bulkheads.
<Computer>  WARNING!  WARNING!  ALL SYSTEMS SHUT DOWN! (The movie screen 
shuts off)
<All look at the floor under Belarius>  O__O   OH NO!  WILY, GET US 
PLANETSIDE!
<Wily>  I'm trying!  I'm trying!
<ALL>  AAAAIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
(Norad III careens out of control, being flung like a rock from a 
slingshot towards Mars by Saturn's gravity)
<X>  WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!
<Belarius>  HAVE FAITH, MORTAL.  WE WILL NOT COME TO ANY HARM.
<Invictus>  He seems pretty confident.
<Washu>  I think we should trust him.  (Norad III is flying towards Mars 
at an alarming rate, it is barely 20 miles from hitting the surface)
<Belarius>  NOW, SEE WHAT A DEMI-GOD CAN DO!  ULTRA FLARE!!!!!! 
(Belarius blasts a massive beam of energy towards Mars, in an attempt to 
slow down Norad III.  Instead, he only succeeds in blowing a large hole 
through the planet.)
<Belarius>  ^__^;  OOPS.
<X>  Well, I guess they'll call Mars the "Holy Planet" from now on, 
right?
<Samus>  THIS IS NO TIME FOR JOKES!!!!!
<Belarius> I CAN STOP THE SHIP WITH MY BODY, BUT I WILL BE DESTROYED IN 
THE PROCESS.
<Meis>  Okay, go ahead.
<All but Belarius>  MEIS!!
<Washu>  Belarius, is this the only way?
<Belarius>  I AM AFRAID SO.
<Washu>  Couldn't we bail out in an escape pod?
<Belarius> THERE ARE NO ESCAPE PODS ON THIS SHIP.  WILY TOOK THEM ALL 
OUT WHEN HE FIRST PUT MY ALTER EGO HERE.
<Washu>  If you have to....
<Belarius>  GOODBYE. (Belarius flies outside the ship, and, with a 
massive explosion of energy, stops Norad III from colliding with Mars)
<Washu> Oh, I wish I hadn't done that to JS.
<X>  So, we just lost our leader, and you're fine with that?  What's 
wrong with you?
<Washu> (Smiling)  What, you think that me, The Greatest Scientific 
Genius in the Universe, would skip making a backup copy of all of you 
guys's brain waves and DNA?  I can just rebuild him, but without the 
horrible mutating ability!
<X>  Amazing!
<Washu>  Okay, let's go into the laboratory area of the ship.  (All, 
obviously, go into the laboratory part of the ship)
<Washu>  Okey-doke, let's get started........Huh?  Who are you?
<Short kid> (Heavy accent)  I am Dexter, boy genius!  And this is my 
laboratory!  MWAHAHAHAHA!
<Washu>  That's very nice, too bad I can spit out better laboratories 
than this one.
<Dexter>  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!
<X>  He has a Mihoshi complex!  Get rid of him!
<Washu>  Can do. (Presses a button on her holoputer and Dexter is gone)  
And that takes care of that!  Now, to recreate JS.  (Starts typing 
furiously on her holoputer and soon two test tubes pop up)
<Invictus>  What are those for?
<Washu>  One is for DNA, and the other one is for cell matter.  Okay, 
here we go! (Presses a button and the two tubes start humming, then 
start glowing different colors.  A third, much larger tube pops up, and 
a shape starts forming inside.  Soon a human-shaped figure is suspended 
inside the tube, and then turns into an easily recognizable figure.)
<Washu>  The process is almost finished.  Shortly I'll insert brain 
matter, and then return the brain waves to his body.
<Meis>  Whatever that means.
<Washu>  Okay, inserting brain matter NOW! (A tube with grey stuff pops 
down from the roof)
<All>  Ewwwwww.
<Washu>  Now inserting brain waves!  (A speaker pops out of the wall) 
*WUMWUMWUMWUMWUM*
Okay, that should do it.  (Presses a button on her holoputer and the 
tank starts to drain)
<JS> Unnngh......Where am I?
<Washu>  You don't remember a thing, do you?
<JS>  What do you mean?  Last thing I remember was someone saying 
something ABOUT RAPING SASAMI!!!!  RAAAAARGH!!!
<X>  O__O!  Washu!  I thought you said you fixed that!
<Washu>  But I did!  Honest!
<JS>  HAHA, gotcha!
<X>  That's not funny, JS.  GROUND FIRE!  *FWOOOOOSH*
<JS>  AAAGH!  PUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUT 
PUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEOUTPUTMEO-*SPLASH!*  Thank you!
<Washu>  Geez X, I just rebuilt him!  You don't have to go and melt him 
so that I have to do it all over again!
<X> (Hand behind head)  ^__^; Whoops, sorry.
<Samus> Okay, if we're finished with our little side story, Wily fixed 
the computer so we can go MST again.
<All> *Groan*  (All file back into the theater)

a boy said looking at Sasami. "I'll also miss the wonderful way Mayuka 
makes the snakes after dinner.

<Meis>  The hell?!
<Invictus>  I don't even want to know.

<Magus: Makes the snakes?!

<Invictus>  What did I just say?!

Tenchi also told me about that." the boy said smiling at Mayuka. "What 
are your names?" Ayeka asked looking each and every one of them. "Their 
names are T.K., Cid, Sephiroth, Vincent, Tye, and Blade."

<JS>  So, the group is basically(In order) a kid from a horrible show, a 
semi-old geezer, a crazy planet-killer, a vampire, another kid from that 
horrible show, and Wesley Snipes?!
<Invictus>  Yeah, I think that about sums things up.

<Crono: why must they be included in this piece of shit?

<Washu> God how I wish I could turn him into a water sprite!

Tenchi said pointing to each of them. "Boys, these girls are Ryoko, 
Ayeka, Sasami, and Mayuka. 

<X>  Hey, he spelled Mayuka right!
<JS>  This guy is really good at spelling something wrong, then right, 
then wrong again.

My grandfather, dad, and another lady named Washue 

<JS>  See what I mean?  First they called her Washue, then Washu, then 
Washue again.
<Washu>  How dare they call me "another lady"?  I am Washu--
<All but Washu>  Yeah yeah, we know.  "The Greatest Scientific Genius in 
the Universe."  You've stated that about a million times.
<Washu>  Hmph.  I wanted to do it again!

are away right now but you will meet them later." Tenchi said smiling at 
the group of teens.

<Crono: thinking dirty thoughts.

<Samus>  Where's the soap?!

"Well, now that we all no each other how about a date!" Sephiroth asked

<Washu>  He sure gets straight to the point, don't he?
<Invictus>  I think he answered his own question when he said,  "now 
that we all NO each other"......
<JS> And I do believe that a question is ended with a question mark, not 
an exclamation point.

<Vegeta: dear god.it's worse than I thought.

<Meis>  You forgot to capitalize "God"!
<Samus>  Religious, are we?
<Meis>  Just a bit, yes.

looking at Ryoko. "Yes, that would be a great idea." Tenchi said 
smiling. "I think we should all get a girl!"

<JS>  I said it before and I'll say it again, (Power Ranger)  IT'S OUT 
OF CHARACTER TIME! dum, dum, DUM dum dum DUM dum dum DUM dum dum DUM DUM 
DUM...........

<Magus : he would NEVER say that.

T.K. said kissing Ayeka hand. "Oh! I think that's a good idea." Ayeka 
said taking T.K. arm as the both of them walked away.

<Samus>  Now, if some ten-year-old kid kissed my hand, I would smack him 
upside the head and tell him to stop thinking he's an adult!

<Crono: (throws up)

<X>  Geez, these guys have weak stomachs!  I mean, the only rhing that 
could have possibly made me uncontrollably lose it would probably be 
TOAPOS.

"Do you girls wanna walk with me?" Cid asked Myuka 

<JS>  There he goes misspelling things again.
<Meis>  Why Cid, I didn't know you were into underage chicks!
<Samus>  Boy, you're askin' fer a whuppin!
<Meis>  I'll be good.

and Sasami. "Sure!" They both said each taking one of his arms.

<Vegeta: (throws up)

<JS>  I HATE PEDOPHILES!
<Washu>  But this isn't a lemon.
<JS>  Does that make it any more just?

"Now we can be alone!" Sephiroth said holding Ryoko's hand.

<Invictus>  I expect any second now he's gonna get thrown into the wall.

<Magus: (throws up)

<X>  Weaklings!
<JS>  Eye socket sex!
<X>  (Throws up uncontrollably)  BLEARGH! Oh God, don't DO that!
<JS>  Now who's a weakling?

"You two would be so happy!" Tenchi said pushing them closer. "Get off 
of me." Ryoko said pushing Sephiroth off of her.

<Samus>  No, Ryoko, you don't say that, you do this! (Grabs Meis and 
flings him into the wall)
<Meis>  HEY---AAAAAAAA*CRUNCH* OUCH.
<Invictus>  You really do hate his guts, don't you?
<Samus>  OH YES.

<Crono: could it be? She's staying in character!

<Samus>  No, no, NO! If she was in character, she would do THIS!  
(Shoots an energy beam at Meis, who is still plastered to the wall) 
*SHEEN* *BOOM!*
<Meis>  OH GOD IT HURTS!

"Tenchi I need to talk to you. Now!" Ryoko said walking out of the 
house.

<Crono: away from Tenchi.

<JS>  Well, if I was Tenchi, I WISH, I probably wouldn't want to go and 
make the most wanted space pirate in the universe angry, so I think I 
would follow her.

"Ryoko!" Tenchi said going after her. Tenchi followed Ryoko all the way 
to the field. Finally Tenchi grapped her arm and said something. "What 
do you think you are doing?"

<Vegeta: (as Tenchi) I expect you to go in there and fuck Sephiroth NOW!

<X>  He would probably rip her head off, just because he's a psycho!
<Invictus>  Y'know, Tenchi actually did that in "Washu's Name is Spelled 
with One 'U', Dammit!"
<X>  That's disgusting!
<Invictus>  I know, you should see what else he does to the Tenchi girls 
in that one.
<X>  I think I'd rather not.

Tenchi asked still holding her arm trying to see her face. "Tenchi!" 
Ryoko said before tears went down her face. 

<Washu>  Okay, the only time Ryoko cries is when Tenchi is about to be 
killed or something.

"What's wrong Ryoko. Do you want me to get Sephiroth. 

<JS> (Question mark nazi)  No question marks for you!
<Samus>  Stop doing that!

"How dare you!" Ryoko yelled smaking Tenchi.

<Meis, getting back into his seat>  Whoa, Ryoko would NEVER do that to 
Tenchi!  
<Invictus>  And what the hell is "smaking"?
<JS>  It's another one of this author's many typos.

Chapter 3:

"What was that for?" Tenchi yelled grabbing Ryoko's arm even harder. 

<Ryoko>  Hey!  Let go of me!  ABUSE! ABUSE!
<Washu>  No, Tenchi would probably be the one saying that.

"I love you Tenchi! When will you finally see that.

<JS>  As I have said to previous authors, ???????????????????????????  
<== I've got a MILLION of 'em, just ask!

<Magus: The constant rape attempts are a dead giveaway.

I don't want to be with Sephiroth I want to be with you. 

<JS>  No shite, sherlock!
<Wily>  HEY!  How did that one slip through the censors?
<JS>  It's all in how you say it.

I try my hardest to be with,

<Vegeta: No.

<X>  So, let me get this straight.  The other MSTer thinks that Ryoko is 
going out with a guy name No?
<JS>  I don't think so.

I try to act normal,

<Vegeta: I don't recall.

<Invictus>  He doesn't recall Total Recall!

but every time I do you push me away from you." Ryoko yelled crying. 
"Ryoko......." Tenchi couldn't think of anything to say. "I just think 
your gonna go off with someone or it will be to late when you finally 
see I love you!" Ryoko said wipping the tears from her eyes.

<Washu>  Yeah, whip those tears, Ryoko!
<JS> (Singing)  Just whip it!  Whip it good!
<Samus>  Okay, enough with the corny jokes and rimshots.

<Crono: you fail to realize he is gay in this.

<All>  O__o;
<JS>  I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think that Tenchi is gay.  I 
mean, in two of the series, he falls for Ryoko.  Or at least is showing 
some feelings for her.

" Tenchi was going to say something back but something hard hit the 
ground making both of them fall. "What was that?" Ryoko yelled.

<Crono: (as Tenchi) An excuse to avoid the conversation.

"I don't know, come-on." 

<JS>  Hobo dash!  Hobo dash!  It seems that a hobo dash has taken up 
residence in betwe--*BAM!*
<Samus>  You did that one already!
<JS>  Owwww........

Tenchi said running back to the house. When they got there everyone was 
in the front. "Tenchi?" Ayeka said still holding T.K.'s hand. 

<Meis>  Ayeka's a pedophile!  Ayeka's a pedophile!  (The all-too-
familiar logs) I deserve this.  *KRRRRZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAP!*
<JS> (Singed)  Why do we have to suffer because of your stupidity?!

"Everyone come here." Washue yelled from the back of the house. 

<X> (Monotone) "'Everyone come here.' Washue yelled."  She must not be 
very excited when she yells.

When everyone got there their mouths dropped. "It's a ship!"

<Magus: five bucks says it's the titanic.

<JS>  (Rose)  I'll never let go, Jack!  I'll never let go!
<Invictus>  You do that surprisingly well.
<JS>  Why, thank you!

<Vegeta: I'll take that bet.

<JS>  HEY!  No gambling in the theater!
<Vegita>  Nyah Nyah!  What're you gonna do about it, kid?
<JS>  Hmph.  I'll have to ask Washu to give me some new enhancement.
<All>  _NO_.
<JS>  Aw, come on!
<Washu>  Well, at least nothing that has you leaking lava.
<All but JS and Washu>  WASHU!

Ryoko said looking at it. "It's the same ship you said that would show 
up in 5 months." Ayeka yelled. "Oh! Did I say 5 months? 

<Meis>  I meant five minutes!

I was thinking when I should get married."

<Washu>  Oh my God, no! (Throws up)
<JS>  Oh My Goddess! (Washu grabs him by the neck)
<Washu>  You might want to stop playing off of your own team's jokes.
<JS>  C-C-Can't B-Breathe......

<Magus: (throws up)

<Crono: Thanks for reminding him. Bitch.

<Washu>  Crono is really asking for it!

Washue said looking at Yosho. "Do you think someones inside?"

< Magus: double or nothing, Vegita. I bet there is a little girl and/or 
a midget in there.

<JS>  Why a midget?
<X> Who knows?

<Vegeta: fine.

Tenchi asked kicking the hot ship. 

<JS>  Then he started running all over the yard screaming, because his 
foot had caught fire.

"Stop it!" yelled a voice from inside the ship. "Listen!" Tenchi said as 
everyone came closer. 

<Samus> (As person inside ship)  Brains......BRAINS!.......

After a second of listening the top come up. 

<JS>  Shampoospeak!

"Are you all okay!" 

<JS>  He mixed up an exclamation point with a question mark.

the voice from inside the ship asked. "It sounds like a girl."

<Magus: sweet.

Sephiroth said getting closer. "Hello!" Tenchi yelled inside the ship. 
"Yeah?" a girl with brownish-blue hair answered coming out of the ship. 
"Hi I'm Sonya." The girl said smiling. "Hi I'm Tenchi, these are my 
friends Ryoko, Sasmi, Washue, Myuka, 

<JS>  3 for 4 so far!
<Washu>  What do you mean?
<JS>  Misspelled names.

T.K., 

<JS>  LOSER!

Cid, my grandpa Yosho, Sephiroth, Vincent, 

<JS>  Two geezers, a homicidal maniac, and a vampire,

Tye, 

<JS>  Another LOSER!

Blade, 

<JS>  Can I have your autograph, Mr Snipes?

and Little Ryo-ohki." 

<JS> (Singing) And a cabbit in a pear--*BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM!*  WHOA!  
Look at all the pretty stars! (Falls unconcious)
<All but JS> (Cracking knuckles)  
<Invictus> OW, I didn't think his head was that hard......

Tenchi said pointing to each of them.

<Crono: It's rude to name names and point fingers.

"Hi well can you please help me? My step-sister Gena isn't waking up." 
Sonya said pulling out a girl with purple-brown hair.

<Crono: out of her ass?

<Washu>  That's really disgusting!
<Crono>  Don't you know?  We're shock value MSTers!

"Sure!" Tenchi said holding her in his arms. "What do I do?" Tenchi 
asked. "Kiss her." Sonya said smiling. "Sweet!" Sephiroth yelled. 
"Tenchi's not kissing anyone from outerspace." 

<Meis>  Gee, I guess there's no space in "outerspace".

Ryoko yelled. "Well, your from space." another girl with purple hair 
said coming out of the ship. "Who are you?" Ryoko asked feeling a little 
stupid over what she just said. "I'm Ve-Ve and this is my sister Me-Me ,

<JS>  And I'm stutter-stutter, and here's mumble-mumble.

<Magus: No relation to PeePee and Ka Ka.

<JS>  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Oh that's a good one!
<Samus>  It wasn't that funny.
<JS.  That's because you have no sense of humor.

my brother Tylor, and his little friend Ken-ohki.

<Washu>  Um, did he kill Nagi and then take Ken-ohki, or something?
<Meis>  Or he could've just drugged the little bugger and stolen him.

<Vegeta: waitaminute...

" Ve-Ve said pulling them all out of the ship. "Wow you have a cabit!" 

<JS>  An evil clone of a cabbit!

Tylor said walking to Sasami. "It's name is Ryo-ohki!" Myuka 

<JS>  Geez, he's really making this misspelling thing an art, y'know 
that?
<X>  No, I think that *shudder* Tank Cop already did that.

said taking it out of Sasami's hands. "Can I show you around?"

<Crono: this is the shrine in the middle of nowhere. This is the house 
next to the shrine out in the middle of nowhere.

<JS>  And these are the two girls who destroy the house next to the 
shrine in the middle of nowhere EVERY OTHER DAY.

Myuka asked him. "Sure." Tylor said as they both walked away. "Well you 
can have him. I have Cid." Sasami yelled watching them walk away. "Come-
on Cid." 

<Samus> (Levels Arm Cannon at JS's head)  If you say 'hobo dash', I'll 
make a smoking crater where your head used to be.
<JS>  EEK!
<Meis>  I thought you said this wasn't going to be a lemon.
<Samus> (points AC at Meis)  DIE! (Blasts at him, but he dodges)
<Meis>  Ha ha, you missed me! (Runs off) 
<Samus>  Get back here you little runt!
<Meis>  No way! (Runs out of the theater)
<JS>  Well, I think that this would be a good time to take a break, 
everyone agree?
<Wily>  I guess I could allow one break, seeing as you're only halfway 
done with the MST.
<ALL>  WHAAAAT?!
<Wily>  Yes, there is still much more to go!  
MWAHAHA*hack*HAHA*gag*......I really should get that cough looked at.

(Inside the rec room, JS is teaching X how to play Warhammer 40K, Washu 
and Invictus are sitting around enjoying some drinks, Samus is still 
chasing after Meis, and Wily is in the lab getting a physical.)
<Washu>  Ahhhh, this is great.  I like having Zero as a bartender! He 
can make you any type of drink you want, and it only takes about two 
seconds!  Of course, you can't overlook the fact that the drink goes 
EVERYWHERE, (Points to her drenched clothes) but still, they are good.
<Invictus>  I'll have to agree with you on that one.  Hey, watch this! 
(Spits on the table, which a half-dollar shaped hole then melts through 
like there was nothing there)  Amazing, huh?
<Washu> (Fascinated)  That was disgusting, but very interesting.  How 
did you do that?
<Invictus>  I have an implanted gland called a Betcher's Gland. It lets 
me spit acid to melt through substances, in case I ever get captured.  
(Spits at a little square thingie, which melts into a blob of metal)
Ha, I love it!
<Washu> (Pissed)  You idiot!  That was an escape mechanism I've been 
working on to get us out of here!  And I don't have the resources to 
build another one!
<Invictus>  Oopsie.
<X>  Hey, this is fun!  Wait a second, how did those guys get over 
there?  Are you cheating?!
<JS>  N-no, I'm not cheating!
<X>  I'm sure.  GOO SHAVER! *BLOOSH*
<JS>  (Covered in goo) Ugh, what is this crap?
<X>  I just covered you in a special goo that'll freeze in 
three...two...one...
<JS>  Hey, wait a....(frozen inside a pillar of ice)
<X> That'll teach you not to cheat against a Maverick Hunter!
<Washu> (Calling over to X)  Hey, you might want to bust out our leader 
there, so we can go and get this MST over with.
<X>  Oh, all right.  GROUND FIRE!  *FWOOSH*
<JS> (On fire)  AAIIEEEE!!!!  PUT ME OUT!!!!  *splash*  Thanks again!
<Samus>  Aha, got you cornered, you little cretin!
<Meis>  Oh no!  RAOU!!!
<Samus>  Aw crap.  (A giant wolf with three blades on it's head[think 
Zero Panzer from Zoids] appears, and zaps Samus into submission, then 
disappears)  Ow, I think I might have broken EVERYTHING!  OWWW!
<X, Invictus, Washu, and JS>  ^__^;;;
<JS>  Okay, everyone back into the theater!
----Resume MST----

Sasami yelled pulling him with her.

<Crono: No self-respecting Cid would be seen with a nine year old kid.

<JS>  Yeah, especially the one from Final Fantasy seven!  He'd be 
saying, "Let go a' me, yah &*%@ing @#$%$!
<Washu>  Such naughty language!  Bad JS!  Bad!  Bad!

"Tenchi if you don't want to kiss her I will." Sephiroth said taking 
Gena in his hands. He pulled her close to him and kissed her softly. "It 
worked you got an earthling to kiss you Gena." Sonya yelled. "It didn't 
work! He isn't a earthling." Gena said jumping from Sephiroth's arms. 
"What did you two do? What is this all about?" Ve-Ve asked. "We made a 
bet that when we land on earth, if Gena can get a earth boy to kiss her. 
I'll clean her computer-transporter for a year."

<Meis>  Whatever that is.

<Magus: why can't I just kill Lavos instead of reading this?

<Crono: Tenchi is from Jurai.

Sonya said. "Well she's rigth 

<JS>  What the hell is a 'rigth'?
<Washu>  It's a typo, honey.
<JS> (Snuggling up to Washu)  You called me honey!
<Washu>  Oh boy, tell me he's not going to dwell on that.
<Invictus>  I'm afraid so.

about him not being a earth boy. He's from the Promise Land." 

<X>  I do believe he was LOOKING for the Promised Land, not from it.

Ve-Ve said looking at him. "Everyone here is from outerspace. Tenchi is 
half humand 

<Samus>  An evil clone of a huma----*crash*
<Meis>  Stop doing that! (Puts down chair)
<Samus>  (Rubbing head)  If I didn't know you had those creatures, I 
would kill you right now.

and half Jurien Prince, 

<Washu>  I don't know what a Jurien is, but it's probably something 
totally different from a Juraian.
<JS>  You called me honey!

Yosho is a King of Jurie, 

<Invictus>  The Jurie will now come to order!
<Meis>  I'd like a large order of fries, a burger.........

Sasami and Ayeka are princesses of Jurie, Ryoko is a sapce piriate, 
Washue's a mad scienties, Myuka is Tenchi's kid which makes her a 
princess,

<JS>  I don't think I have ever seen that many typos in one sentence, 
ever.
<Washu>  Hey, you stopped!
<JS>  You called me honey!
<Washu>  Argh......

<Crono: .the hell did you come up with that?!

T.K., Cid, Sephiroth, Vincent, Tye, and Blade are frome the P.L."

<JS>  What the hell is a PL?
<Washu>(Thinking)  Maybe if I don't say anything, he'll get off of me.
<JS>  You called me honey!
<Washu>  What can you read my mind now?

<Crono: no they aren't.

Ve-Ve said studing them all. 

<Meis> (As everyone)  Ow, those studs really hurt!

"How do you know this all?" Washue asked her. "Because next to you 
Washue I'm the greatest scientice in the universe. Ve- Ve said with a 
small smile.

<X>  I'm guessing this is a SI character.
<Washu>  You're probably right.
<JS>  You called me honey!
<Washu>  (Breathing fire) STOP THAT!
<JS>  EEEEEK!!!  (goes into a corner and starts making a circle on the 
ground with his finger)  I thought you liked me......
<Washu>  *sigh*  Oh, alright.  Come here.
<JS>  ^__^  YAY!
<Meis>  (Pondering)  Hmmmm.......(Snuggles up to Samus)  You called me 
honey!
<Samus>  Oh no you don't!  (flings Meis back up into the rafters)
<Meis>  (Flying)  IT WAS WORth a shoooooot!!........
<Samus>  Not really, no.

<Vegeta: DEATH.

<Washu>  Another out-of-the-blue statement.

Chapter 4:

"We are the Six Lights." 

<All>  And we are the Six Darks!

Sonya said. "Sonya and I are step- sisters, Ve-Ve, Me-Me, and Tylor 
(plus Ken-ohki) are brothers and sisters and they are are bestfriends." 
Gena said looking at Tenchi. "Well it was nice meeting you, we have to 
go." Ayeka said pulling T.K. away."

<JS>  I know if I say it I'll get shocked, so I won't.
<Meis, up in the rafters>  But I will!  Ayeka's a pedophile!  Ayeka's a 
pedophile!  Ayeka's a ped--(A faint *krrrzzzaaaaaap* is heard up in the 
rafters, followed by screaming)
<All but Meis>  HA HA!

<Magus: THE END

"Bye." T.K. said as he was being pulled. "Why didn't you guys tell me 
you were from space!" 

<JS>  (As group) Uh, because we wanted to keep a low profile?
<Washu>  (As Tenchi)  Well, crashing in our backyard isn't exactly 
keeping a low profile.

Tenchi asked. "We didn't want to add anymore spacey people to your 
life." Sephiroth said.

<Invictus>  Space Spacely, at your service!

<Crono: idiot.

<Invictus>  I am not!

"Well, it's a little late for that now. It looks like we are staying her 
with you for a while. 

<Meis, still up there) So, they're stopping her for a while?

Our ship is broken." Ve-Ve 

<JS>  AAAAH!!  It's the Bohrak Va!
<All but JS>  O__o;  What the hell?
<JS>  Bionicle.  If you don't know what it is, shame on you!

said looking at a broken piece of ship. "I don't have the room for you!" 
Tenchi said sounding a little disapointed. "I do." Ve-Ve said snapping 
her fingers. When she did her ship turned into a house bigger than 
Tenchi's. 

<All>  How conviiiiiiiiiiinient!

"Wow!" Blade said lookig at it. "Want a tour Blade.?" Ve-Ve asked with a 
wink. "Sure." He said as they both walked inside "Now that you know I'm 
from space you want to go out?" Sephiroth asked Ryoko. "In your dreams." 
Ryoko yelled. 

<Samus>  Yeah!  You tell him!  Fight the power, sister!
<All but Samus>  O__o; Okaaaay....

"I'll go out with you Vincent." Sonya said. "Okay!" Viincent said taking 
her hand. "You wanna go out?" Tye asked Me-Me. 

<JS>  Geez, everyone is going out!  Hey Washu, would you go out with me?
<Washu>  There's nowhere to go out to, JS.
<X>  She does have a point there.
<JS>  Okay, so we could go in.  (All but JS facefault.  When Meis does 
this, he falls off the ledge and starts hurtling towards the ground)
<Meis>  aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--*WHUMP*  Ouch....

"Sure!" She said jumping into his arms. "Well Tenchi it looks like it's 
just you and me." Gena said smiling at him. "Yeah!" Tenchi said in a 
trance like way. 

<JS>  How typical of an SI.  First, they are usually built perfectly, 
have some charming personality, and always gets the girl/guy.

He pulled her close to him and smiled."Tenchi your coming with me!" 
Ryoko yelled pulling him into the air. "She can fly!" 

<JS> (Singing)  You can fly, you can fly, you can fly, you can fly, you 
can fly, you ca--*THWACK*
<Washu>  That's enough, dear.  OH NO.
<JS>  (Bambi eyes)  You called me dear!

Gena said yelling. "Yup!" Ryoko said laughing. "I can too." 

<JS>  Gee, what a surprise.

Gena said rising off the ground. But something pulled her back down. 
"Stay with me." Sephiroth said. "What ever." Gena said looking at Tenchi 
in the air. Ryoko flew Tenchi all the way to the forest. "You were going 
to leave me again." Ryoko yelled dropping Tenchi to the ground. "Ryoko!" 
Tenchi yelled pulling Ryoko to him. He grabbed her face and kissed her. 
"What?" Ryoko thought confussed. "I love you too!" Tenchi said hugging 
her. "Tenchi." Ryoko smiled kissing him back.

<JS>..........Okay, maybe she DOESN'T  get the guy.

<Crono: I could have made a zillion remarks but is it really necessary?

<Invictus>  I've always wondered, is 'zillion' an actual number?
<Washu>  I don't think it is.

<Vegeta: Am I dead yet?

<JS>  Actually, you are on the show.

<Magus: (throws up)

<Invictus>  Okay, they must be vomiting out their organs by now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~At Dinner~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<Washu>  What fancy spacing you have!

It was dinner time and everyone was happy as can be. (Not really.) Ve-Ve 
and Blade never came out the house.

<Crono: fucking

<Washu>  WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!! (Crono gives her the finger)  
OHHHHH..........
<JS>  Uh-oh.
<Washu> (Steam shooting out of her ears) GRRRRR......As soon as I get 
out of here, YOU'RE DEAD CRONO, YOU HEAR ME?!

Ayeka and T.K. were making love eyes and rubbing feet.

<Meis>  I've had enough pain for today.

<Crono: bieng stupid.

<JS>  Just like you, what with misspelling 'being' and all.

Cid and Sasami (mostly Sasami) was having a love conputition with Myuka 
and Tylor.

<Crono: Seeing who can fuck the longest.

<Washu>  God, this guy is such a little perv!

Washue and Yosho were looking at wedding stuff,

<JS>  All together now!
<ALL>  EWWWWWWW!

<Crono: here it comes. Quit mentioning that!

<Magus: (throws up)

<Vegeta: you eat a lot, don't you?

<Invictus>  I was wondering that too.

Sonya and Tye were talking about the M.T.V Sprinbreak and holding hands.

<Samus>  So that explains why the authors's such a retard.  they're from 
the MTV generation.

<Crono: being stupid while watching idiots make softcore porn.

<Meis>  Ohhh, I wanna watch!
<Samus>  What if it was Cid and Sasami?
<Meis> (Turning green)  Ugh, never say that again!

Me-Me and Vincent were talking about movies,

<Crono: Being Geeks with pale skin (like me).

Tenchi and Ryoko were talking about how much they love each other.

<Washu>  How typical.

<Crono: Having no lives

While Ken-ohki and Ryo-ohki shared a carrote

<JS>  A mutated carrot!

<Crono: Making more abominations of nature.

<JS>  Hey, I have actually seen a real, live cabbit, so shut up!  They 
are very cute!  AND NO IT WASN'T IN A DREAM!
<All but JS>  ^__^;  We never said that!

and Sephiroth and Gena didn't talk to each other at all.

<Crono: Doing my job.

"Gena is really cute! I have to get her to like me somehow!" Sephiroth 
thougth as he looked at her. "I got to get Tenchi to like me.

<All>................
<JS>  I never knew Sephiroth was gay.
<Samus>  I guess you learn new things every day, don'cha?

<Magus: damn love triangles. Never work out.

<Washu> (Muttering)  I know from experience.
All but Washu>  (Staring at Washu) o__O;
<Washu>  Oh, did I say that out loud?  Silly me. Heh, heh, heh......

I also have to get this cow Sephiroth away from me." 

<All>  MOO!
<X>  Oh, so it was the SI talking when it said, "  I got to get Tenchi 
to like me."  I see now.

Gen thought looking at Tenchi and Ryoko. "Well, I think we should all 
get to bed." Yosho said. "Yes that's a great idea." Gene said jumping 
up. 

<Washu>............PLEASE tell me that he isn't the same Gene from the 
horrible "Gene Masaki" series.
<JS>  I'm not sure, I wasn't really paying attention to the fic before.

"Tenchi would you like me to give you a tour of my house?" Gena 

<Invictus>  Holy crap!  That must be a new world record!
<JS>  What is?
<Invictus>  Misspelling your OWN SI's name, THREE TIMES!
<JS> (looks at the past few sentences) Well I'll be a shoe at a dog 
show!

asked him. "No maybe later I think I'm going ot hang out with Ryoko 
more, maybe Sephiroth would like to see it."

<Crono: our commets made this fic twice as long, at least. Oh, well.

<JS>  And our comments made it about twenty times as long!

Tenchi said walking upstaries with Ryoko. Everyone left the table 
leaving Gena and Sephiroth alone. "Gena I.." Sephiroth began but was cut 
off by Gena. "Sephiroth I know you like me but I'm not interested." Gena 
said disappering.

<Vegita: That's basically what I said to Bulma, but noooooo! She drugged 
me and.nevermind.

<JS> (Pointing at Vegita and laughing) HA HA!
<Meis>  So that's how Trunks happened.

After 2 hours Gena went into Tenchi room.

<Invictus>  Geez, it took her THAT long to get up the stairs?

<Magus: am that so?

<JS>  More Shampoospeak!

"Everyone is sleeping so know one will know I was in here." Gena thougth 
as she cut her leg and rubbed black stuff on her body. She opened 
Tenchi's door and walked in weak like. "Tenchi help me."

<Washu>  What a shithead, tricking Tenchi like that.
<All but Washu> O__O!
<Washu> (Sheepishly) Oops, did I say that?

<Crono: (as Tenchi) NO!

Gena said falling on his floor.

<JS>....Promptly cracking her skull open and killing her instantly.
<All>  THE END!

Chapter 5:

<All>  CRAP!

"Gena what happened to you." 

<JS> (Question mark nazi)  No question marks for you!
<Samus>  You already did that one.
<JS>  I did?  When?
<Samus>  Near the beginning.

Tenchi said running over to her. "A man came in my room and hurt me very 
bad." 

<JS>(Gena)  Pow widdow me, i'm awl defenswess.
<All> *snicker*

She said falling into his arms.

<JS>  But missed entirely, promptly cracking her skull open and killing 
her instantly.  THE END!
<Washu>  You really want her to die that badly?
<JS>  ANYTHING to make the bad fic stop!

<Crono: you know your blood looks a lot like black paint? 

"You can stay here with me." Tenchi said putting pillows and covers on 
the floor. I'll sleep on the floor you have my bed." Tenchi said. "Can 
you sleep up here with me. 

<Samus> (Aiming Arm Cannon at JS)  If you say, "No question marks for 
you" one more time, I'll blow your freakin' head off!

I'm to scared."

<JS>  So she's going to Scared?  Is that a city or something?

<Vegeta: (muttering angrily under his breath)

Gena said holding his hand. "I...I...I don't think that's such a great 
idea." Tenchi said turning red.

<Crono: Idiot.

<Vegeta: Idiot.

<Magus: Idiot.

<all: Idiot!

<JS> Retards.
<Washu>  Retards.
<Samus>  Retards.
<X>  Retards.
<Invictus>  Retards.
<Meis>  Retards.
<ALL> RETARDS!

"Please Tenchi don't you care if I get hurt." 

<JS>  This guy was doing pretty well with the punctuation and all, up 
until now.

Gena said looking into her eyes. 

<Invictus>  I didn't think that was physically possible.
<Meis>  Maybe she had a mirror?

Tenchi just looked at her and couldn't help put look down at her little 
shirt than saying yes. "Oh! Thanks Tenchi." Gena said moving over. 
Tenchi turned out the light and moved as far away as possible from Gena. 
But he keep having a feeling that she keep moving closer.

<Vegeta: (keeps on cursing angrily)

<JS> (Jamaican accent)  We're goin' inta 'Epburn Heights to kill me some 
filthy Diablos who been boom-boom bastin' me lady Queen Lizzy!
<X>  What the hell are you talking about?
<JS>  Haven't you ever played Grand Theft Auto III?

3 hours passed and Tenchi was closer than ever. He wanted to put his 
arms around her so much put fought it.

<Crono: it took three hours for him to just get to the point of wanting 
to put his arms around her?

Gena knew Tenchi couldn't hold out much longer. "Tenchi you silly boy! 
Your body must bother you so bad." Gena thought as she watched him move 
around. There was moment of silence (no moving I mean) than Tenchi lost 
controll. "Gena I Need You NOW!!"

<Magus: and they fucked happily ever after. The end.

<JS>  WAHAHAHA!  That's pretty funny!
<Washu>  I wonder if his mother ever washed their mouth out with soap?

<Vegeta: I wish. Ryoko is likely going to walk in on them.

Tenchi yelled. "Yes Tenchi." Gena yelled. He was about to go on top of 
her but a flash of light went over the room. The next thing they new it 
was morning.

<JS>  YAY!  They skipped the sex scene!  Now I can say something nice 
about this somewhat horrible fic!
<Washu>  Really?
<JS>  No, not really.

<Crono: oh, the old dream sex scene.

"Wake-up! Wake-up my little lover!" a deep voice whispered in Gena's 
ear. "Tenchi! Oh! Tenchi I'm so happy." Gena said hugging the body with 
her eyes close. "Tenchi?" the voice asked. Gena opened her eyes and saw 
Sephiroth in her face.

<ALL>  (Nelson Muntz)  HAW-HAW!
<JS>  Oh, that's a good one!  Taking the person you love away, and 
putting the person you despise in their place?  I love it!

<Magus: .she sleep-fucked?

<All>  O__o;

"Sephiroth! What are you doing here?" Gena asked jumping out of the 
covers. "You came here last night. You said you needed me and wanted me 
more than anything." Sephirtoh said taking her hand. "What?" Gena said 
pulling away. "We didn't? I couldn't have? I went to Tenchi's room last 
night!"

<Vegeta: Sleep-fucking. That's a new one.

<JS>  You already said that.

Gena said jumping off the bed. Gena ran out of Sephiroth room and ran 
across the yard to Tenchi's house. She ran inside and ran up to Tenchi's 
room, and opened it with a hard crash. She would of kept going but she 
crushed into someone when she entered the room. "Who are you?" Gena 
asked looking at a short looking lady.

<JS>  (Short old lady) Hello, I'm looking for my son-in-law.

<Vegeta: damn.this means more story.

Chapter 6:

"My name is Amy. I'm looking for Yosho." the lady said with a evil 
smile.

<Magus: (throws up)

<Crono: damn you, Yosho fuckers! I have to clean all this puke, you 
know!

<JS>  Yeah, and we don't particularly like the smell, either!

"I don't know where he is, but why are you in here." 

<X>  (Ryoga)  I'm looking for a question mark.
<JS> (Person)  Question mark?  Why, that's at least five hundred miles 
north, far away from this fic!

Gena asked getting a little angry. "Looking for Yosho." Amy said. Gena 
didn't even stay to talk she just walked down the hall and started to 
look for Tenchi. "You did it again didn't you?" a voice from behide her 
asked. "What?" Gena asked turning around. When she turned Ve-Ve was 
standing infront of her. "You tried to get Tenchi to fall for you, I 
been watching you and all the things you have done. Leave him alone, 
there are other men in this house you can go with. Besides Tenhci 

<JS>  I don't think this guy has learned about the miracle of the 
spellcheck.

loves Ryoko."

<Crono: why do you care?

Ve-Ve said smiling. "Get out of my face! Tenchi loves me even if I 
wasn't making him see Ryoko!" Gena yelled. "What do you mean seeing 
Ryoko?" Ve-Ve yelled. "Nothing!" Gena yelled trying to walk away. 
"You're making him see Ryoko!

<JS>  Great, Ryoko hallucinations.

<Magus: oh, yeah. The zombie thing. A simple yet effective spell. Still, 
it's normally used by male magelings so males would naturally have less 
of a defense against it.

<JS, Meis, Invictus, and X> (Zombies) Brains..........we need BRAINS!

<Vegeta: We mock fics, not analyze them! (Magus bows his head in shame)

But he's calling her Gena! Isn't he!" Ve-Ve yelled in a angry voice. 
"What's going on?" Sonya asked walking into the room. "Why is everyone 
in Tenchi's house?" Gena asked. "We were making something to eat for 
everyone." Sonya said rubbing her eyes. "Gena I'm not going to tell 
anyone what you are doing. You'll just have to find out the hard way if 
Tenchi really loves you are not." Ve-Ve said pulling Sonya back to the 
kitchen.

<JS>  Where Sasami was probably doing all the cooking, as usual.  Ho-
hum.
<Meis> (Ent)  HUM-HOOM?

<Crono happily ever after. THE END.

<Samus>  I guess they want the fic to stop as much as we do.

"I know he loves me." Gena thought to herself. "So who is this Tenchi 
guy you are all talking about." Amy asked walking down staries. 

<JS>  I don't think Staries likes that, do you?

"Will you just go away!" Gena yelled. "Maybe I can help you." Amy said 
with a ugly smile.

<X>  I didn't know you could make an ugly smile.
<JS>  Yeah you can, like this! (Makes ugly smile)
<All but JS>  O__O!  NEVER DO THAT AGAIN!

<Magus: Ugly-yosho/washu (throws up)

<JS>  Man, by the time this fic is over, we're going to be wading 
through puke.

"No that' s okay." Gena said walking back to her house. But as she began 
to leave Tenchi walked inside. "Gena?" Tenchi said looking at her. 
"Where have you been?" Tenchi asked worried. "Tenchi about last night!" 
Gena began but Tenchi stopped her. "I'm happy about you and Sephirtoh!" 

<JS>  So, I think that's four different misspellings of Sephiroth so 
far.  They got it right the first time, then everything went downhill 
from there.

Tenchi said. "But I was with you!" Gena said. "No Ryoko and I were 
together last night. I tried to ask her what happened to her, but she 
said I was dreaming and said she was never with me." Tenchi said. "Oh! 
Tenchi but..."

<Crono: I don't understand.

Vegeta: then blow it up.

<Washu> (Sarcastic)  Oh yes, violence solves everything!
<X>  For Vegita it does.

Gena began to say but Amy walked between them. "So you are Tenchi!" Amy 
said wickely. 

<JS>  How can you say something like a candle?

"Who are you?" Tenchi asked. "I'm Amy! she said with a smile. I'm 
looking for Yosho."

<Invictus>  She seems to always be smiling.

<Magus: (throws up)

<Washu>  My, my, my.  What a weak constitution.

"Oh! I'll get him. Grandpa someone is looking for you." Tenchi yelled 
down into Washue's lab. "Grandpa?" Amy asked confussed. "You are his 
grandson?" Amy asked looking at Tenchi. "Yeah!" Tenchi said. Amy snapped 
her fingures and a red ball went around Tenchi's body. "Tenchi!" Gena 
yelled grabbing the ball. But when Gena touched it a red flash of ligth 
went through her body. 

<Washu>  OH NO! NOT THE RED FLASH OF LIGTH!  ANYTHING BUT THAT!

"Gena! Are you okay!" 

<Samus>  No question mark for you!  Oh no, I'm starting to be like them.

Tenchi asked. "When you find Yosho tell him I have his grandson. Also 
tell him if he ever wants him back he will come to me." 

<Meis>  Ewwwww.  Is he even still capable of that?
<Samus>  You're disgusting!  *BAM!* (Smacks him into the wall)
<Meis>  PAIN......

Amy said disappering with Tenchi. "Noo!" Gena yelled. Gena began to yell 
and scream, pretty soon she past out. Tenchi bieng held hostage. That's 
new.

<Washu>  What a child, throwing a hissy fit like that!

Chapter 7:

When Gena finally opened her eyes, Sephirtoh 

<JS>  I guess they've decided to stick with one way of misspelling his 
name.

was holding her. "What happened?" Ryoko asked grabbing her. "Amy took 
Tenchi! She said if we ever want to see him alive again, Yosho must come 
to her." Gena said slapping Ryoko's hands way. "Do you know this Amy?" 
Washue asked Yosho.

<Magus: washu/yosho-same sentence-(throws up)

<Invictus>  Pretty soon I'm gonna fling this guy out the door.

"Yes! Amy always told me when I was little that she'll come for me. 

<Meis> (Plastered to the wall)  Geez, she must have really like him 
then!
<Samus>  Why won't you die?! (Repeatedly shoots Meis)

If I never return to her as I once said I would." Yosho looking down. 
"Everything is happeneing to Tenchi, because of you. Why don't we just 
kill the old man." Vincent said with a smile.

<JS>  Do it!  Do it!  Do it!

<Vegeta: that's the best idea I've heard all day.

<X>  Amen to that!

Everyone just looked at him. "I'm sure he's just kidding!"

<Vegeta: I wasn't.

Sonya said pinching him from under the table. "Well, we have to find 
him. Washue do a research and find where they are located." Ayeka 
demanded. "I already done that." 

<JS>  Even more Shampoospeak!

Ve-Ve said handing Yosho a paper.

<Crono: (as Washu) bitch. Stealing my job.

"They're on Saturn!" Yosho yelled. "We only have room for 3 people on 
this ship I made. Plus we have room for Tenchi. Yosho is going of 
course, so we need 2 more people." Washue said looking at the group. 
"I'll go!" Gena and Ryoko both yelled. "You're not well! You should stay 
here and rest." Sephirtoh said grabbing Gena's arm. "When I ask for your 
help! I'll ask!" Gena said moving away. Sephirtoh 

<JS> (Juliet)  Sephirtoh, Sephirtoh, whereforth art thou, Sephirtoh?

was about to say soemthing else, but Tylor stopped him.

<Magus: he was going to say "poogoo!"

<JS>  o__O  What the hell is "poogoo"?

"Okay, you guys come with me!" Washue said leading them down to her lab. 
When they got there a ship (Which was Ryo-ohki)  was sitting in the 
middle of the room.

<JS>  Well why didn't they just say that Ryo-ohki was sitting in the 
middle of the room? 

"All of you be safe, and come back in one pieace." Washue said kissing 
Yosho.

<Crono: oh shit.

<Magus (pukes out a large island)

<JS>  So that's where Hawaii went!

<Crono: O_o damn that's a lot of puke.

They got on the ship and Ryo-ohki blasted off. When they landed it 
wasn't hard to find them. Amy had Tenchi in a glass tube, 

<Samus>  Test tube baby!

in the middle of a tower. "I have your grandson Yosho!" Amy said licking 
her lips.

<Vegeta: here comes the raping.

<Washu>  That's really disgusting.

"Tenchi!" Gena and Ryoko yelled. "I'll go to Amy, you two girls get 
Tenchi out!" Yosho said as they split apart. Ryoko and Gena ran into the 
tower, they had to clime about 73 steps before reaching the top. When 
they arrived Tenchi was covered in ice. "Tenchi! I'll get you out!" 
Ryoko yelled. She walked to him, but was stopped by a force. "It's 
protected by a field!"

<Vegeta: WILL THE EARTH SURVIVE?

<JS>  I think he has Tourette's Syndrome or something.
<Meis>  Geez, he's just Mr. out-of-the-blue, isn't he?

Gena yelled. "It's not going to stop me!" Ryoko yelled as she blasted 
energy at the field. When the energy hit it, it did a chain reaction and 
hit Ryoko, Gena, and Tenchi. "Don't do that!" Gena yelled in pain. "Yes! 
Don't or you'll all end up dead." Amy said comming 

<Invictus>  Opening comms channel......NOW!

from behide Tenchi. "Where's Yosho?" Gena asked looking at Amy. "He's 
okay, I just split myself into two. So he'll see me still!" Amy said 
with a smile.

<JS>  It's Multiple Man!  Er, Woman!

<Crono: uh.Magus, she's raping Yosho.

<Magus: yeah, so?

<JS>  Maybe he got over his puking binge.

<Crono: uh.Tenchi fucked washu?

<JS>  When the hell did it say that?!

<Magus: really? That's weird.

<Crono: I don't understand.

"Let Tenchi go!"

<Vegeta: (as Amy) NO!

Ryoko yelled as she jumped into the air and shot a ball of fire at Amy. 
"Is that all you got!" Amy yelled throwing her own fire ball at Ryoko. 
The ball hit Ryoko in the back and she fell head first into the ground. 
"Ryoko!" Gena yelled running to her. "You're next." Amy yelled throwing 
a ball of fire to Gena. Gena ducked the ball and throw a ball of ice to 
Amy. Amy douged it and it disappered behiden her.

<JS>  I did not understand a word of that last sentence.

<Crono: yeah, you douge that and make it disapper behiden you."

I think you lost." Amy said as she throw a ball of fire at Gen and 
Ryoko. Gena grabbed Ryoko and disappered to another spot in the room. 
That patteren repeated until Amy throw an unexpected ball of fire at 
them,

<Crono: and this pattern was PLAID!

<Washu>  O__o;  Riiiiiight.

making Gena drop Ryoko. "No, she will not win!" Ryoko said flying to 
Tenchi. When she reached him she began to punch the ice. She punched 
until her hands began to turn red and cuts reveled. 

<Samus>  What did the cuts revel in?
<JS>  And you would think that she would use her energy beams to melt 
the ice.

Amy just looked at her, before shoting fire at her. "Ryoko!" Gena 
yelled. Ryoko turned to see the ball of fire but didn't move. "What are 
you doing?"

<Magus: (as Ryoko) many things yet nothing at all.

<All>  Huh?

<Crono: the hell kind of remark was that?

<All>  That's what we want to know!

Gena yelled. "I can't let it hit Tenchi!" Ryoko yelled as the ball of 
fire smashed her into the block of ice. "Ryoko!" Tenchi yelled as he 
opened his eyes.



Chapter 8:

Ryoko fell hard into the ground. "Ryoko are you okay?" Gena yelled 
running to her. When she got there Ryoko seemed to be in some kind of 
shock. "That's one down, now one to go!" Amy laughed as she threw a ball 
of fire at Gena. Gena jumped over the fire, but it hit Ryoko. When it 
hit her, it put her into a iceball just like Tenchi. "Crap! She has both 
of them."

<Washu>  Now that just defies all the laws of science.  How can fire 
possibly encase you in ice?

<Vegeta: you'd think the fireball wouldn't encase them in ice.

<Washu>  Y'know, maybe Vegita isn't such an idiot after all.  (Vegita 
flips her off) Okay, maybe I was wrong.

Gena yelled watching Tenchi and Ryoko yell in pain. 

<Invictus>  Everyone's yelling!

As Gena turned around Amy came flying her way. Amy smashed Gena into the 
ground punching her. "Why don't you just die?" Amy asked hitting Gena. 
"This is the end!" Amy yelled as she throw her hand into the air, 

<JS>  o__O  She has wooden hands?

making the biggest ball of fire and ice.

<Crono: and it evaporated before reaching anything.

<Washu>  If this fic followed ANY laws of science, that would have 
happened.  But of course, it doesn't, so I'll just have to endure this 
travesty of science.

Amy pointed it to her head and smiled. "No!" Gena yelled. There was a 
bright flash of light! 

<X>  Oh, how exciting!

Then a short moment of silence. When Gena opened her eyes Sephiroth was 
holding her. "It was you, who took me from Tenchi's room that night!" 
Gena yelled. "We don't have time for that!" Sephiroth said pushing her 
off his lap. "So your Sephiroth! I heared some good things about you. It 
seems you are the leader of the Ancents of the Promise Land!" Amy said 
smiling. "Yeah and now I must kill you."

<JS>  Number one, Sephiroth tried to KILL the Ancients, and the author 
actually spelled his name right!

Vegeta: GOD BLESS AMERICA.and Japan.

<JS>  I dub thee Sir out-of-the-blue.

Sephirtoh yelled pulling out his 3 yard knife. 

<JS>  The Masamune blade?  That's only two yards long!  And usually 
knives that are more than a foot long are called swords.  And they 
spelled the name right again!

"Why do you want to do that for?" 

<JS>  The 'for' wasn't necessary.

Amy asked confussed. "Because you tried to hurt someone I love!" 
Sephiroth said with a smile. "Well, not yet! Now I have hurt someone you 
love."

<Crono: what?

<Washu>  We don't know either.

Amy said as she snapped her fingers. When she did a ball of lightning 
came into the room and shot Gena in the back. "Gena!" Sephirtoh yelled. 

<JS>  Great, there they go again spelling names wrong again.
<Samus>  What is she, goddess of the four elements?

Amy moved her fingers again, when she did Gena flew into the air and was 
pined into the wall. 

<Meis>  Yeah, pine trees do hurt when you're whacked with them.
<Samus>  Like this? (Pulls out a pine tree from hammerspace and clobbers 
Meis with it)
<Meis>  Yes........like that.........
<Invictus>  Now Amy has telekinesis?  What kind of person is she?

"I pined her to the wall by a lightning force. So I can shock her any 
time." Amy said laughing. Amy looked at Sephirtoh and shot a ball of 
fire at him. It hit him in his arm and he grapped it with pain. 
"Sephiroth leave! You don' t need to risk your life for me. I don't like 
you!" Gena yelled. "That hurts a guys feelings!" Sephirtoh said with a 
smile.

<Crono: he smiled after saying it hurts a guy's feelings.my god he's a 
woman!

<X>  Did that make any sense to you guys?
<All>  (Shake their heads)

"Well, here's something for the rest of you guys." Amy said as she 
snapped her fingers again. When she did that a shock went to Tenchi and 
Ryoko. 

<Invictus> (Shock)  Hello, I'm shock!  Nice to meet you!

They both screamed with pain. "Well, I'll save them if it makes you feel 
better." Sephirtoh said as he winked at Gena. "Yeah, that's okay!" She 
said. Sephirtoh looked at Amy and jumped into the air. The wind blew 
throw his hair and over his light blue eyes as he hit Amy in the arm 
with his knife. "That was painful!" Amy said smiling. 

<Meis>  She must be a sado-masochist.
<JS>  And I'm pretty sure that if Sephiroth hit someone in the arm with 
his sword, they would have one less arm.

Amy pointed her fingure to Sephiroth and a beam came out, 

<X>  And now she's a DBZ character.  Great.

and shot him in the chest.

<Vegita: like in a zillion Dragon Ball Z episodes.

Sephiroth fell to the ground with a hard smack. "Sephirtoh!" Gena yelled 
looking at his lifeless body on the ground.

<Washu>  She must really like his toe.

<all: start singing sephiroth's theme music

<JS>  I didn't know you could sing his theme, I thought it was just a 
bunch of fat ladies screaming gibberish.  (Sephiroth's theme starts 
playing)  Oh boy.
<Sephiroth>  Did you just insult my theme music?
<JS>  N-no, Mr. Roth, sir!
<Sephiroth>  Yes you did!  I heard you!  Time to die!
<JS>  EEEEK!  (Runs away)
<Sephiroth>  Come back here!
<JS>  No way!
<Washu>  Hmmm....I don't really want to have to rebuild him, so I guess 
I have to do this.  (Types up some schematics on her computer, and JS 
changes into Cloud Strife)
<JS/Cloud>  What the hell?!
<Sephiroth> (Stopping dead in his tracks)  OH NO!  It's YOU!   
AAAIIIIEEEEEE!(Runs away)
<JS/Cloud>  So, you're afraid of this body, eh?  The hunter has become 
the hunted!  MWAHAHAHAHA!
<Sephiroth> (Screaming like a little girl)  AAAIIIIIEEEEEE!!! Get him 
away from me!
<JS/Cloud> (Chasing after Sephiroth) I would leave the way you came in 
if I were you.
<Sephiroth>  Okay, but I'll be back!

Chapter 9:

"That's all I needed." Tenchi said as he began to glow. 

<Washu>  Is he going super-saiyajin or something?

"What?" Amy said looking at Tenchi. "If you're wondering what's 
happening why don't you pay more attension to my grandpa."

<Crono: I don't wanna pay attention!

Tenchi said smiling. Amy closed her eyes and put her self back into her 
other body. When she opened her eyes, Yosho was holding a knife in her. 
"What just happened?" Amy said weakly. "I put a knife in you! 

<Invictus> (Amy) Gee, I don't think I could've known that unless I was 
blind!
<JS>  Besides the fact that Katsuhito uses a bokken. 

I kind of figured you spilt yourself in two. 

<Meis>  Crud.  She made a mess when she 'spilt' herself!

So it was easy to kill your second half." 

<Washu>  I see.  She only has one mind, but can switch it between the 
two bodies.

Yosho said with a smile.

<Crono: wouldn't it still make more sense to have killed her even if he 
didn't know?

<X>  Violence is not the answer!

"I hate you! But I still have your friends!" Amy said laughing as she 
closed her eyes and went to her other body. When she opened her eyes 
Tenchi was smiling at her. 

<Samus> (Tenchi)  ^__^  Time to die!

"How did you get down." 

<JS>  She asked without a question mark.

Amy said moving back from Tenchi. "Grandpa power!" 

<All>  O__o;;;;;  What the hell?!
<JS>  I do believe it's called "The Royal Power of Jurai".

Tenchi said as he threw a knife at Amy. 

<X>  Why do they all have knives?  What are they, ninjas?

Amy moved out of the way just in time. "I'm sick of you all! You're 
going to die now!" Amy said lunching balls of fire.

<Washu> (Amy) Yum yum!  These balls of fire taste great!

<Magus: the fireballs that turn people into ice?

<Washu> (Amy, eating fireballs)  Huh?  Oh crap! (Freezes)

She first threw on at Tenchi than another one at Gena, Ryoko, and 
Sephiroth. Sephirtoh rolled out the way, but Gena and Ryoko were hit. 

<JS> I do believe she said Sephiroth was a lifeless body.
<Samus>  Stop saying "I do believe"!

When the fire hit their bodies they both screamed. "It seems you have to 
pick out of the two." Amy said as she made the fields holding them 
disappered. "No!"

<Vegeta: yes!

Tenchi yelled as he watched them both ami to the ground. Tenchi jumped 
into the air and grabbed Ryoko. When they landed he looked back at Gena 
hoping he still get her. But when he looked she already hit the ground. 
"No, Tenchi! You picked Ryoko! I should of guess you loved her more than 
me."

<Meis>  YAY!  The SI is going to die!

<Crono: (as Gena) Rosebud.

<JS>  Isn't that the name of the basselope on Bloom County?
<Washu>  It's also a sled.

Gena said as tears fell out her purple eyes and down her lovely brown 
skin. "Well, it seems that you like that Ryoko girl more, so why don't 
we just get rid of the other one." Amy said throwing a ball of energy at 
Gena. "No!" Tenchi yelled.

< Magus; YES!

"Gena move!" Sephirtoh yelled weakly on the ground. "No! There is no 
reason I should move. It's clear that Tenchi doesn't love me, no one 
does. I'm all alone and knowone cares about me!" 

<Invictus>  (Gena)  I know knowone cares about me!

Gena said waiting for the ball of energy to kill her off.

<All> (Chanting)  Kill her off.  Kill her off.  Kill her off.

<Crono: (as Gena) again, Rosebud.

<JS>  Stop saying Rosebud!

She closed her purple eyes and waited. There was a little quite than she 
hear a painful scream than a body fell next to her.

<JS>  Then the author decided to make a run-on sentence, then we came 
along and made fun of it, then we went to find the author, then we--
*BAM* Ouch.
<Washu>  (Cracks knuckles) Stop doing that.

Chapter 10:

When she opened her eyes Sephiroth was on the ground in front of her. 
"Sephiroth what are you doing? Why did you do something so stupid for 
me? I been so rude to you! 

<JS> (Ricki Ricardo)  Lucy, I been so mean ta you!

Why are you doing this?"

<Vegeta: (as Sephiroth) Because I forgot where I live and I thought you 
might know.

<X>  That made no sense at all.

Gena yelled as tears fell from her eyes. "You said no one loves you! I 
want to prove that wrong. I love you Gena! I always had, from the very 
first time I saw you!

<All>  Awww, isn't that sweet!

<Crono: (as Sephiroth) I made that ungodly obvious!

<JS>  That is true.

I hope you can find that out, somehow." Sephirtoh said slowly as he 
closed his eyes. "No! Open your eyes!" Gena yelled pushing and shaking 
him. Gena stared for a seconded and looked at him, light tan skin and 
his soft white hair. She kissed his head and whispered something into 
his ear. When she looked back up, her eyes where a dark glowing purple. 
"I'll kill you!"

<Crono: I kill you, you kill me, we're a happy family.

<JS>  AGH!  BARNEY REFERENCE!  HE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO LIVE!

Gena yelled as she pulled out Sephiroth knife. "Not this old trick 
again!" Amy said geatting ready. The two girl's fought for a while, than 
finally Amy shot Gena in the leg. "It seems I won girl." Amy said 
looking at the weak Gena. "No, it seems that I won." Gena said as 
Sephiroth knife began to glow.

<Vegeta: IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE I WILL KILL YOU ALL!

<Meis> (To Vegita)  You're a very violent person, you know that?
<Vegita>  Have you ever seen the show?

Gena pointed the knife at Amy and yelled, "Swored Blaster Destroy." 

<All>  O__O  What the hell?
<Washu>  AND she yelled it in a monotone voice.
<JS>  See, to make something dramatic, you do this:  TOTAL 
ANNIHILATION!!!  RAAAAAGH!
<All but JS>  (clap) Very nice.

When the words were finished a great ball of fire smashed into Amy. Amy 
screamed and a blast of dust flow around her.

<Magus: THE END. If you even read this far.

<Washu>  Unfortunately, we did.

When the dust was gone, Amy was gone. There was only a ring and Amy's 
shoes. 

<Invictus>  It's the ruby red slippers!

"You killed her! Gena you did it." Tenchi said trying to hug her. "Get 
away from me!" Gena yelled walking to Sephirtoh's body. Tenchi just 
stared confussed. "Sephiroth! I'm sorry I let this demon do this to you. 
I should of known you loved me!

<Crono: you did know. You kept on telling him to fuck off.

<JS>  That is true.

Well let me tell you something my love, I love you too. If you were her 
I'll be yours forever." 

<Meis>  Great.  She loves a dead body.

Gena said kissing his lips. Gena got up and looked at Tenchi and Ryoko. 
"Ryoko you're lucky! You have Tenchi, to love you always. I envey you 
so!" Gena said leaving the room. When she got outside Yosho was standing 
near Ryo- ohki. "Lets go!" Gena said getting into the ship.

<X>  Is it over?
<JS>  Not yet.
<X>  Goddammit!

Chapter 11:

<Crono: fuck. Another chapter.

When they arrived back everyone was glad to see them. "Tenchi we all 
missed you so much!" Sasami said hugging him. "Daddy! I'm glad you're 
back." Myuka said kissing his head.

<Magus: Tenchi fucked them on the spot and sent them to bed.

<JS>  I am SO going to kill Magus as soon as we're done.

Washue kissed Yosho,

<Vincent: (throws up a giant rat head)

<JS>  Okay, since when is Vincent in their group?  And why the hell did 
he eat a giant rat?

Ken- ohki gave Ryo-ohki a carrote and rubbed his face on hers. "Where's 
Sephirtoh?" Tylor asked looking around. "He's gone!" Gena said running 
into her house. "What happened?" Blade asked sadly. "Sephirtoh gave his 
life for Gena!"

<Crono: HE WAS ALREADY DEAD!

<JS>  Thank you for stating the obvious, genius.

Tenchi said looking down. "What? But Gena hates Sephiroth!" Me-Me said 
confuessed. "Not anymore!" Ryoko said hugging Tenchi. "Lets all talk 
about this at dinner." Sasami said leading everyone into the 
dinningroom.

<Vegeta: good plan. Talk about all the death and destruction while 
eating.

"Gena are you comming dear?" Ve-Ve asked yelling up at her room window. 
"No! Leave me alone!" Gena yelled back down. "Poor Girl." 

<JS>  Why is girl capitalized?
<Samus>  The world may never know.

Ve-Ve thought as she walked inside. Gena watched everyone go inside the 
house, she flow out her window and into the forest. She sat down on a 
tree and looked up into the sky.

<Magus: (as Gena) Clouds are purdy.

<All> (Magus)  Duh duh duhhhhh.........

"Sephiroth! I'm sorry!" Gena said as tears came down her face. There was 
a blow of air, and it whipped through her purple-brown hair. When she 
looked down, she could of sworen someone was watching her. "Who is 
that?"

<All>  Sephiroth.
<JS>  These stories are so predictable.

<all: sephiroth.

Gena said yelling at the person. "Go away!" Gena yelled to the person. 
"Okay, I thought you might of wanted me here." The person said turning 
around. "I know that voice." Gena said watching the person. "Wait!" Gena 
yelled flying to the person. She looked hard at the person than tears 
rolled down her brown face. "Sephiroth?" Gena asked walking closer. 
"Yeah?" Sephiroth said looking at her.

<Vegeta: yak yak yak happily ever after. THE END.

<All>  Yakkity yak, don't talk back!

He opened his arm and waited for her to hug him. She walked over to him 
and looked into his crystal blue eyes. "What happened?" Gena asked. "You 
wished me back! So I'm here and waiting for you to hug me!"

<Magus: "wished back" my ass.

<JS>  Well of course!  What do you expect?

Sephirtoh smiled. Gena looked at him again, than slapped him across the 
face. Sephirtoh looked at her stunned. Gena looked at him again and than 
kissed him. "Wow!" Sephirtoh thought as he put his arms around her hips. 
They kissed for what seemed a life time before breaking apart. 

<Washu> (Sephiroth)  *GASP*  Need......air........*WHEEZE*

"I love you! And if you ever do that again, I'll kill you!"

<Invictus>  That made no sense at all.  She just got him back, now she's 
threatening to kill him?

<Vegeta: As a gesture of love, I'm sure.

Gena said punching Sephirtoh in the chest. Sephirtoh looked down at her 
and moved her hair out her face. "I love you more!" Sephirtoh said as he 
kissed her passioninatly.

<JS>  Sephirtoh, Sephirtoh, Sephirtoh.  they have absolutely no idea how 
to spell his name correctly.
<Meis>  Well, they DID spell it right a few times.
<JS>  Right, but those were probably just flukes.
<Washu>  Ewww.  Flukes.

<Crono: What comes next, kids?

Vegeta: they play chess?

<X>  Checkmate!
<JS>  That's not checkmate.
<X>  Checkmate!
<JS>  That's not checkmate.
<X>  Checkmate!
<JS>  That's STILL not checkmate.

Magus: they eat raw pig?

<Meis>  Yum yum!

THE END!

<all: thank god!

Epilogue

<JS>  (Reduced Shakespeare and Co., singing)  And Romeo, and Juliet, are 
deeeEEAAAAD!!!!  WOO!

<Crono: so it WASN'T the end.

<JS>  (Singing)It's the end of the world, as we know it!
<All but JS>  STOP SINGING!

Sephirtoh came back and everyone was very happy. Most of the people 
stayed together and some didn't, check out the life of what happened 
next.

<Crono: I don't wanna!

T.K. and Ayeka:

<JS>  Ayeka was burned at the stake for being a pedo!  (Logs)  Aw crap, 
I forgot!  *KRRZZZAAAAP!*

T.K. and Ayeka didn't stay together. 

<All>  GOOD!

Ayeka had to go back to her planet and wasn't able to bring T.K. with 
her. Ayeka went back to earth when she became queen of her planet, 

<JS>  Her planet this.  Her planet that.  It's called JURAI!

just to get T.K. to become her king. When she finally found T.K. he 
already had a wife and a non-born son. Ayeka was upset and left earth 
with a broken hurt. She is now 5,454 million years old (78 in earth 
time) 

<Washu>  Actually, she's around seven hundred and eighteen Earth years 
old.

with 2 kids and 45 grandchildren. 

<Washu>  Those were some very busy kids.

Her husband Ferory died when he was 5,456 (80 on earth)

<X>  Was that the pink-haired dude?
<Washu>  That was Serio.

<Magus:)O_o 45 grandchildren with two kids?!

<Vegeta: so.is she doing well?

<Crono: the match didn't make sense anyway. Then again, this fic doesn't 
make sense.

Cid and Sasami & Myuka and Tylor:

Cid cheated on Sasami with Myuka. When Tylor found out about it he went 
with Sasami. Sasami and Tylor are 39 in human years and have 4 children. 
They have no grandchildren at the moment. Cid and Myuka are living in 
Mexico with a 2 weeks-old son Me-OKO and his twin brother Bo- Nato. 
Myuka's 37 and Cid's 39, they live a happy life and don't talk to Sasami 
and Tylor at all.

<Samus>  That is exactly like a soap opera!

<Magus: Damn Brady bunch crap.

<Vegeta: HEY.I like the Brady Bunch.

<X>  Y'know, I never knew that.

<Crono: (backs away from Vegita)

Yosho and Washue:

Yosho and Washue got married 5 months after the fight with Amy. They had 
a son and a daughter, with about 13 grandchildren. Saddly to say the 
both died in a spaceship crash. A astroide hit it and it exploded.

<Washu>  (glowing red) GRRRRRRR.......
<All but Washu> (Backing away) Oh no.....
<Washu>  (As calmly as she can be)  I am GOING to FIND this perSON and 
KILL THEM!

<Magus: ( (throws up things you don't want to know.

<JS>  HEY!  You ate my Magic card collection!

<Vegeta: I had no part in their deaths.honest!

<Crono: Thanks a lot.I have about a large planet's worth of puke 
(literally) to clean up now.

Vincent and Sonya:

Vincent and Sonya didn't stay together long. Vincent moved on with a 
playboy bunny and Sonya fell in love with some guy named Eric-chan. 
Vincent was never heared from again and Sonya and Eric-chan live in 
Oswago. They have 4 children and another on the way. Sonya's 42 and 
Eric-chan's 41.

<Magus: How does a pale guy with no personality and a mettalic arm wind 
up with a playboy bunny?

<Invictus>  One of the great mysteries of the universe.

<Vegeta: Why do you call him Eric-chan when he is 41?

<Crono: I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!

Tye and Ve-Ve:

Ve-Ve and Tye stayed together for the longest time, plus they both 
became famost. Ve-Ve became the worldest smartest scientice after 
Washue's death. 

<Washu>  RAAAARGH!  NO SECOND-RATE SI IS GONNA TAKE _MY_ PLACE!

Tye became a singer and a pre-school music teacher. They have 1 girl and 
a grandson. They are both 45 years old.

<Magus: who is Tye?

<JS>  He is a kid from a horrible show, which I dare not speak it's 
name.
<Meis>  What, Digimon?
<JS>  AAAIIIEEEE!!  You said it!  I am scarred for life!

<Vegeta: do you have any sense of spelling or grammar?

<Crono: Why do we all have to say something at the end of these things?

Blade and Me-Me:

Blade and Me-Me also stayed together. Me-Me helped her sister out in the 
science and Blade bcame Tye's manger. Me-Me and Blade are both 30 years- 
old.

<Magus: is it coincidence that all of the people in this are about the 
same age?

<Vegita: why would the greatest scientist ever need an assistant?

<Crono: CAN THE EARTH SURVIVE? FIND OUT NEXT TIME IN MY CRAPPY SERIES OF 
FANFICTION MSTs!

<Washu>  What the hell is wrong with these people?

Ken-Ohki and Ryo-Ohki:

These two stayed together and had about 45 cabits. 

<JS>  I like cabbits.  But I think that may be a little too many.  And 
also, the only way they reproduce is when they die.

They are still having babies and trying to get Sasami and Myuka to be 
friends again. They both live with Tenchi and Ryoko.

<Magus: Damn, that's a lot of cabbits.

<Vegita: why do they need Sasami and Myuka? Tenchi provides them with 
food.

<Crono: THE MONKEYS WILL KILL US ALL!

<JS>  This guy is really starting to piss me off!

Tenchi and Ryoko:

These two got married and had a son named Ten-Ko. Tenchi became a 
artiest and Ryoko became a space cop. (Who knew?) She's still a bad azz 
but she keeps that on a D.L.

<JS>  Yet another unreadable sentence.

<Magus: I stopped trying to make sense of anything a while ago.

<Vegita: Why did they keep the cabbits?

<Crono: Try the new PURPLE SMILK!

<Meis>  What the hell is smilk?

Gena and Sephirtoh:
 
<Meis>  Camel toe! (Runs away)
<Washu and Samus>  For that remark, you will die!  Come here!
<Meis>  Woohoo!  I've got two women chasing after me!
<Washu>  Yeah, but we don't just want you.  We want you DEAD!
<Samus>  C'mere, you little steaming pile of crap!

They stayed together and became the worldest greatest pair. 

<JS>  "Worldest greatest pair"?  This person is a Tank Cop clone!
<Meis>  Nyah nyah, you'll never catch me!

Gena became a modle and a writer. Sephroth also became a modle 

<Invictus>  What the hell is a modle?

and became a animator, he helps out Gena. They have 2 boys and 1 girl 
named, Antonio, Veto, and Maria. 

<X>  Yeah, Veto.  As in, they should Veto the law that allows this crap 
to be written.
<JS> (Sarcastic) Gee, I wonder if this person is Italian?

They live happy life on Saturn. 

<JS>  There is a lot of Shampoospeak in this fic.

(Sephiroth said it's the perfect place to start there life. Not to say 
he got killed there.)

<Magus: Fuck it. I'm with Crono. CHEESE IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL!

<JS>  Yeah!  Go cheese!
<X and Invictus>  O__o; you're starting to act like them.
<JS>  Kill me now!

<Vegita: Bet you didn't think I'd be the one that still has somewhat of 
a mind!

<X>  Naw, Vegita was crazy to begin with.

<Crono: C'mon, Vegita! Everyone's doing it! It'll make you feel good!

<JS>  (Stoner)  Yeah man, you get to see all the pretty 
colors....woo.....
<X>  Is that the end? 
<JS>  I do belie--*BAM*  
<Samus>  Stop doing that!  (Resumes chasing Meis) I'll get you!
<Washu>  I've lived for twenty thousand years, and I can chase you for 
twenty thousand more!
<Meis>  Man, this is fun! (Dodges a plasma bolt)  WHEE!
<Samus>  Dammit, I missed!
<JS>  Okay, let's get out of here.  Whaddya say guys?  Guys?  (X and 
Invictus are watching the chase with Meis, Washu, and Samus)
<X and Invictus>  This is like horse racing, with them running around 
the theater like that!
<JS>  Okay, whatever.  You guys stay here if you want, I'm leaving.  (JS 
exits the theater)
------In the main room------
<JS>  So, Zero, how have you been doing?
<Zero>  Well, not too good.  The people at Capcom seem to like to kill 
me off every other game, and I'm getting pissed off by it!
<JS>  Yeah, I kinda noticed that when you crushed seven of my drinks 
while you were bringing them to me.
<Zero>  Yeah, why don't they pick a storyline and stick with it?
<JS>  The world may never know.  (Faint screaming is heard) So, anyway, 
how has Wily been treating you?
<Zero>  Like crap.  First, it's *shudder*  a foot massage, then it's 
*double shudder* a sponge bath.
<JS>  Ewwww.  I feel your pain.  (The screaming gets louder)
<JS>  What do you think they will base the seventh X game on?  And what 
the hell is that screaming?
<Meis>  aaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!  Get her away from me! (Careens past 
JS and Zero) 
<JS and Zero>  ^__^;
<Samus>  GET BACK HERE!  Stand still so I can kill you!
<JS>  Now that's really irrational.
<Samsu> (Comes to a screenching halt) *SCREECH* (See?)  What did you 
just say?
<JS>  ^__^;;;;  Oh nothing, nothing.
<Samus>  Good, that's what I thought you said.
<JS>  And where did Washu go?
<Samus>  She got tired and fell asleep inside the theater.
<JS>  Oh.  Well, I'm off to bed.  (Turns to camera)  See you next time!  
Same Kablam time, same Kablam network!

<JS>  Hey, JS here.  I'm going to have my fourth MST up soon, if not 
immediatly, so look for it, and send me your comments!
