Well, checking back here and noticed the fics, but no-one did
Tenchi ... <evilgrins> Let's write, shall we? Here's my pitiful
addition to the fray ^_-

     -----------------------------------------------------

Somewhere in the countryside of Japan, in a nice-sized house ... 

   It's a peaceful day. Birds singing, wind blowing through the
trees, you know, things like that. Until:

Ryoko  : "Kyaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!"

 It's unfortunate that Tenchi was sitting almost right next to
everyone's favorite space pirate.

Tenchi : "Ahh! Ryoko! What is it?"

Ryoko  : <slams paper down on coffee table> "Look at this ... this ..."

Ayeka  : <glances at paper> "I believe the term you're looking for is,
  er, BS?"

Kiyone : "This ... this is horrible!" <skims through article> "I
  can't believe this! We can't condone it!"

Mihoshi: "Actually, Kiyone was just telling me- " <Kiyone glares at
  Mihoshi> " ... that she was watching something the other day, I
  can't remember what, and she said, 'Mihoshi, don't you think that
  this anime is just a piece of - "

Kiyone : "SHUT UP, YOU!!!!!" <clamps hand over Mihoshi's mouth> "Uh,
  he he, you know Mihoshi, doesn't know what she's saying ... "

All    : <sweatdrops> "Uh, yes ... "

Ryoko  : "Well, we can't just sit here and do nothing, right?" <flaps
  tail, eyes start glowing just a little>

Ayeka  : "Er, yes. Well, maybe Washu can help us with this?"

<Minna stands up and heads for the door under the steps. Ayeka glances
  around, thinking, "Where's Sasami?" then shrugs and follows the
  others, finding abovementioned Sasami with everyone else>

<"Jukem jukem goko no serikere!!!" scene switch>

Washu  : " ... and program in the Fibonacci sequence ... add for a
  subspace phase variation ... "

Ryoko  : "Washu-san!!!"

Washu  : "Wha- oh, it's you, Ryoko. You look happy. What is it?"

Ryoko  : "Read this!"

Washu  : <scans article> "Hmm ... really? What's the VP of programming
  for the Cow and Chicken Network saying that our anime is drivel?"

Ayeka  : "We were wondering if there was anything we could do about
  it, Miss Washu?"

Washu  : "I've got it!"

All    : "What! What is it?"

Washu  : "We bomb 'em all!!"

All    : <sweatdrop> "Um ... "

Washu  : "Ha ha! No, seriously, I've got just the thing!"

Tenchi : "What's that?"

Washu  : "Remember my Dimensional Cause & Effect Controller?"

Ayeka  : <groans> "How could we forget?"

Washu  : "Well, I've done a little modifying ... instead of creating
  new realities based on certain criteria, it can now open matter
  conduits between realities and create nexuses between them as
  well!! See?"

All    : "No, not at all."

Washu  : "It can transmit matter between universes and make ... stopping
  points between them. NOW do you see?"

Ayeka  : "So what you're saying is that it can move things between
  universes?"

Washu  : "Yes! Exactly! <mutters> At least they caught on this time ..."

Kiyone : "What about living material?"

Washu  : "Well, ... yes, that should work too."

Ryoko  : <gets curious gleam in eye> "So what you're saying is that you
  could transport us to another dimension- "

Washu  : "Reality."

Ryoko  : " ... whatever, and let us do ... whatever?"

Washu  : "Theoretically, yes .. "

Ryoko  : "All right! There's a first time for everything ... " <turns to
   Tenchi>   "So, whaddya say we go show those USA Today freaks who's
   boss?"

Ayeka  : "Oh, no you don't! Tenchi is going with me." <grabs Tenchi's 
  right arm>

Tenchi : "Oh, no ... "

Ryoko  : "Whaddya mean, he's going with *you*?" <grabs left arm> "I 
  asked first!"

Ayeka  : "The thought of him even considering going with you is 
  unthinkable, you, you- "

<Tenchi's eyes begin to go spiraly>

Kiyone : <sighs> "Look. Why don't we all go?"

Ayeka & Ryoko: "That'd be a great idea!" <glare at each other, 
  "hmph!",and turn backs on each other>

Washu  : "Great! Let's get this figured out, then! Everyone
  into a seat!"

<Cautiously, Tenchi, the five girls, and the cabbit take a seat. To 
  everyone's relief, they neither spin, disappear, or anything like
  that, but stay>

Washu  : "Okay! Hands OFF the controls this time, kiddies! Heinlein 
  vector,  fourteen Fibonacci, and awahahay, we go!" <presses a large,
  red button and cackles>

<From the center of the seats, a large beam of what appears to be laser 
  light shoots up into a light receptacle on the ceiling. It gets 
  brighter ...and brighter ... and- well, you get the idea. Finally, it 
  splits off into seven parts, one for each chair. With a ritualistic 
  scream, the travelers disappear>

Washu  : "That was fun!" <pikus> "Hey, wait for me!"

<"Doesn't Ryo-oh-ki have the cutest lisp in the Pioneer dub?" scene
switch>

    There is a flash of light, and Tenchi & Co. are standing inside the 
lobby of what appears to be the USA Today main office (surmised from the 
large plaque reading "USA Today" on one wall). The time/space travelers 
look around them as the author switches to normal writing for the "real" 
world.
    "So I guess it worked," said Tenchi after a few moments.
    Washu comes into substance behind him. "Well, of course it worked!
What did you expect?"
    "I think he thought that the machine would blow up, or have a
misset- " offered Mihoshi before Kiyone claps her hand over her mouth.
    "What? No way! That's always user error," explained Washu, glancing
meaningfully at Ryoko.
    Ryoko didn't notice Washu's gaze, and did her wonderful little 
disappearing-jump teleport over to the elevator. "Come on, we don't have 
all day!"
    "Actually, Ryoko, we have- " began Tenchi.
    "Let's just get this over with," muttered Ayeka, grasping 
Tenchi's... elbow and firmly propelling him toward the elevator.

<Ryoko vs. Ayeka scene switch>

    "And so, in conclusion- "
    "We demand an apology!!!"
    The door to the editors' office burst open, and in came ... 
well,guess who.
    "Who are these people?" demanded NE #1[1].
    "Hi, I'm Ryoko!" With that, Ryoko leaped onto the large, circular 
table that seems so popular in today's business setting. "And I demand 
retribution!"
    "Erm?" asked NE #2.
    "What in blazes are you talking about?" queried NE #3.
    Washu shoved the newspaper, still in mint condition after the 
turbulent vortices it had passed through in its journeys, into the face 
of NE #4. Gasping,he saw the now-infamous headline, "US children safe 
... " "Wh- what is the meaning of this?"
    "Oh, come on. Haven't you caught on yet? I mean, come on, here's 
Washu, Tenchi, Ayeka, Kiyone, Sasami, Mihoshi, and Ryoko," said 
Ryo-oh-ki in that kawaii lisp.
    "I .. I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about," 
said NE #2 faintly.
    Tenchi shrugged. "It figures."
    "These guys are worthless!" exclaimed Ryoko. "I say we just torch 
'em!" She brought her hands together, preparing to do just that.
    NE #1 paled. "Y- you can't do that!"
    "Actually, we can," said Ayeka, showing him a cleverly concealed 
document. He read: "Otaku Regulations. 1. You shall not kill Named 
Otaku. 2. Any Nameless characters you come across are basically yours to 
do whatever you want with."
    "Hey, Ayeka, isn't that the Otaku Wars!- " started Mihoshi.
    "Quiet!" hissed Kiyone. "Does it matter?"
    Mihoshi shook her head slowly.
    "This is a waste of time," complained Washu. "Besides, I brought the 
perfect thing to do the job." She showed everyone a silver sphere.
    "What's that?"
    "It's a Contained Spatial Causality Device! A minor invention. Guess 
what it does. C'mon, just guess!"
    "I ... have ... no ... clue," said everyone in the room.
    "Oh, come on! It's a Contained Spatial Causality Device!"
    Total, complete silence.
    Washu sighed. "Alright! It completely annihilates everything within
a certain amount of space!! Get it?!?"
    "Ooooh," said the Tenchi cast. The Nameless Editors blanched
visibly.
    "Gimme that thing!" cried Ryoko, grabbing it from Washu's hands.
Unfortunately, in doing so she pressed a small button on the side
marked "Activate".
    Washu's voice emanated from the sphere. "Hi! Is this thing on? ...
Okay. This bomb has been ... <spooky voice> turned on ... and in about
five minutes everything in the room will be a couple wisps of vapor!
Ha ha! Neat, huh?"
    The NE's screamed.
    "Well, look what you did, Ryoko," scolded Washu.
    "That's alright. Just turn it off!"
    "There isn't an off switch, baka!"
    Ryoko made an extremely embarrased face, not unlike A-ko (but that's
another spamfic which someone else can do better than I). "Um, I guess
we ... get out of here, ne?"
    "Device detonation in ... oops, sorry, about one minute now!"
    The Nameless Editors sank in their chairs; Tenchi & Crew were
blocking the door.
    "Back ... to our reality!" cried Washu. "Everyone around me. Now,
I just press this button here ... " She did so.
    "Now what happens?!" demanded Kiyone.
    "Well, it takes some time for the signal to travel across the
realities and back ... but when it does, we're out of here!"
    "And how long is that going to take, Washu?" asked Ayeka calmly.
    "Oh, about half a minute to get there."
    "HALF A MINUTE?!!?!?!?!?!" exploded Ayeka.
    "Well, whaddya expect? We're traversing time and space as we know
it. Of course there's gonna be a little lag ... "
    "BUT THAT THING'S GONNA BLOW UP!!!" shouted Ryoko, summing up the
fears of most of the people in the room.
    "Well, if you hadn't grabbed it from my hands ... "
    "This is all your fault, Ryoko!" accused Ayeka.
    "Hey, I didn't see you doing anything brilliant!"
    "Were you trying to get us all killed!!??!"
    "Ten ... nine ... eight ... "
    "Just shut UP!" yelled Ryoko, throwing one of her fireballs. Just
as it would have hit Ayeka, the Tenchi crew disappeared. Two seconds
later, the Nameless Editors jumped from their chairs. In another two
seconds the bomb went off.

<Pretty Sammy, Ryoko, and Ayeka scene switch>

    Huddled around a monitor in Washu's laboratory, Tenchi, Ryoko,
Ayeka, et al. listened.
    "And finally, experts are baffled by the sudden collapse of the USA
Today building in New York. Structural engineers at the site say that
the building collapsed due to a lack of support on the east side, where
the editorial offices were. Strangely, no wreckage from the offices
were found; it is as if they simply blinked out of existance."
    "And now, let's go to the weather desk- "
    "Well, it worked, didn't it?" asked Washu, barely heard over the
argument between Ryoko and Ayeka. Tenchi sat to one side, resting his
head on his hand and rolling his eyes. And so, here I leave you, glad
that anime is here for good, no matter what some misguided souls will
say. Because WE'RE the fans, and they're just ... people. Otaku
forever!!!
WE WILL PREVAIL!!! <piku piku> anyway ...
