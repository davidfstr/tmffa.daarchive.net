Full Circle Part 3
MSTied by: Jamie Jeans with some help from his friend, Josh Brooks

My eleventh fan fic MSTied. At this rate, It'll be at twenty in no time!
Well here I am, back at MSTing one of the worst self insertion fan fics
that I can find. It's not that the spelling and grammar are bad, even
though they are, but the fact that this guy inserted himself into a time
in the Tenchi universe in which he has a chance to solve everyone's
problem and crap like that. It's sad, once you think about it, that
these people place themselves in these stories and really hack out
everything that makes them good in the first place.

Anyhow, the legal stuff: Mystery Science Theater 3000 and all of its
characters and concepts belongs to Best Brains Inc. Please don't sue me
for I am merely borrowing your characters and not making any claim on
them. However, Samantha Jones is a character that I created, thus
meaning that she belongs to me. Hey Adam, this is your work and you're
welcome to it! I'm just MSTing it.

Now, on with the story!
________________________________________________________________________

With one final pull on Frank's leg, Dr. Forrestor yanked his assistant
out of the opening of the umbilicus. Frank landed on the floor, his face
blue from lack of oxygen, with the fan fic gripped tightly in his right
hand.

"You definitely need to lose some weight Frank," the scientist observed
as he bent down and picked up the fan fic. "I could hardly get you out
of there."

Bringing the fan fic over to the fan fic teleporter, his latest
invention, Dr. Forrestor laughed maniacally as he placed it on
teleporter pad and activated it. with a flash of 60's special effects,
the fan fic was beamed aboard the Satellite of Love.

SATELLITE OF LOVE

Crow yawned and took a sip of his coffee, which immediately poured out
of his body as it was not water tight, and placed it on the desk with
the lights on it.

"Ah! There's nothing like a good cup of coffee," he commented.

"What do you mean nothing like a good cup of coffee," Tom asked, having
just come into the room in time to hear it. "You *can't* drink coffee.
You don't need it."

"Oh, like your opinion means anything to me," the golden robot said,
using his arm, which was working for once, to lift the cup and take
another sip.

Samantha and Mike came into the room to see Crow's second sip fall onto
the floor.

"Uh Crow? You do know that all you're doing is spilling coffee on the
floor right," Samantha asked.

"No I am not! I am having a good cup of coffee!"

Mike was about to interject his own opinion of this when the lights and
sirens sounded, indicating that a movie or fan fic was about to start.

"Geez! Not even a warning this time," Mike said, picking Tom up and
rushing into the Theater.

"I guess Dr. Forrestor was really eager to get that Full Circle story to
us," Tom commented.

(DOOR SEQUENCE) 7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

Samantha sat in the fourth seat while Mike placed Tom in the third and
sat in the second. Crow was last, sitting in the first seat as he
continued to sip his coffee.

SAMANTHA: You're only going to get your seat wet Crow.
CROW: But I need my caffeine in order to stay up.
MIKE: The last time I checked Crow, it was four in the afternoon and
you're a robot. You don't need caffeine.
TOM: Told you!

>                            INTERLUDE
SAMANTHA: But it's the beginning of the story! How can there be an
interlude?
TOM: I take it that all of Adam's courses in script writing usually got
marked with an F.

>Establishing Shot: Blackness.  In the background a pair of soft
>drums can be heard. The blackness zooms out and we see the
>iris of the eye, it holds a distinct magenta hue.  The camera
>continues to zoom out until we see the younger face of AEKA.
>She is crying on the shoulder of her older half-brother YOUSHO,
>who is petting her purplish hair.
TOM: But the dream did not start this way! It started out with Aeka
making a wreath of flowers on Jurai!
MIKE: Careful Tom. You'll only blow up your head if you nit-pick.
CROW: <Sarcastic> Like *that* warning has worked before.

>                               AEKA
>               Why do they have to be so mean?
SAMANTHA: <Motherly voice> Because you're in a fan fic with the author
dear.

>                               YOUSHO
>               <soft> They fear of what is to become
>               of the Empire if it becomes impure.  The
>               public doesn’t think very well of humans,
>               they were very upset when they found out
>               my mother was one.
TOM: <Furious> This was not explained until the fifth show! You can't
get anything right Adam!!!!

>                               AEKA
>               But why does it have to be this way?
>               What do we have to fear from humans?
MIKE: Then you've obviously never been shopping on Christmas Eve.

>                               YOUSHO
>               We have a lot to fear, or the consul does.
>               Azusa is a powerful Emperor, but it is
>               likely that I will be more powerful.  The
>               Imperial Science Academy discovered
>               a while back that human blood, mixed
>               with that of a Juraian, was stronger than
>               that of a purebred Juraian.
ALL: HUH?!
CROW: Made up bull.....
MIKE: <With his hand over Crow's Mouth> There'll be none of that young
man.
CROW: Oh you never let me have any fun! <Takes a sip of coffee which
spills onto the seat>

>                               AEKA
>               But isn't that good?
>
>                               YOUSHO
>               It is in many ways, and in many ways
>               it is not.  The people are very biased,
>               they were in outrage when Azusa told
>               them that Funaho was human, and that
>               their only crown heir was of mixed blood.
TOM: <Announcer voice> Yes! Whenever slandering the script of a good
Anime series, please call for advice from Adam Chris Leigh. You can
reach him at: 1-900-555-CRAP!

>YOUSHO puts his hands on AEKA's shoulders, she looks up
>into his eyes, he is staring far off into the distance.
MIKE: And wondering what he could have possibly done in order to be put
in a fan fic with a self inserted character.
CROW: <Takes another sip of coffee> Ah this ain't working! <Throws the
cup away>

>                               YOUSHO
>               But they are wrong. <beat> A strong
>               Emperor can only make the Empire
>               stronger, but that is out of sight for them.
>               They only see my mother, they look
>               at me and see only a human, not a
>               Prince or a Juraian, but a human.
>
>                               AEKA
>               <determined>I know what we can do.
>
>YOUSHO looks down at AEKA.
>
>                               AEKA
>               You can marry me.  That way they'd
>               have to make you Emperor.
TOM: ARGH!!!!! IT WAS AZUSA THAT ARRANGED THE MARRIAGE!!! AZUSA!!!!! IT
WAS NOT OFFERED BY AEKA!!!!
SAMANTHA: Calm down Tom! You'll only blow your top!

>YOUSHO smiles a bit at his half-sisters offer.
>
>                               YOUSHO
>               Azusa would find a way around that,
>               he fears what the public would do if
>               he didn't do what they thought was
>               right.  <frowns>  And what would
>               you be?  Just one of the Imperial
>               Wives?  Wouldn't you like to rule
>               someday?
>
>AEKA is silent.  YOUSHO digs in his pocket and pulls out the
>Tenchi-Ken, it has no gems in it.  He holds it in his hand and
>looks to the sky with hate.
MIKE: If this guy saw the OVA series, then how come he hasn't gotten
very much of it right?
CROW: I'm not sure but I think ego and self interest came into play.

>                               YOUSHO
>               I don't know what I can do anymore.
>               Either I'll be forced to be Emperor
>               for a public that hates me, or I'll be
>               forced to leave by a father who loves
>               me.  <grits his teeth> There must be
>               some other choice.
>
>The sight of YOUSHO is drowned out by flames that soon
>part to show a much older AEKA (the one we know) running
>through ruins.
>                               AEKA
>               <yelling> YOUSHO! YOUSHO!!
>               Ooh, my love where are you?!!
>
>A large, flaming beam falls in front of AEKA, the flames flare
>up and when they die down we see YOUSHO with the
>Tenchi-Ken fighting a green eyed RYOUKO.  They fight
>with the fury and skill of the greatest swordsmen.  In the end,
>YOUSHO stabs RYOUKO in the neck and extracts a small
>third gem that lands in his hand.  RYOUKO suddenly kicks the
>sword away and flies away in RYO-OHKI.
SAMANTHA: Never minding the fact that none of this ever happened and
Aeka was not in a flaming building and...... I'm stopping right there
before my own head explodes.

>Cut to AEKA trying to navigate through the broken and flaming
>wreckage.  She suddenly looks up to see RYO-OHKI flying into
>space with YOUSHO following close behind.
>
>                               AEKA
>               YOUSHO!! Don't leave me! Yousho
>… how could you …
>
>AEKA pulls through the wreckage, tearing a few of her robes,
>and dashes over to where the ships just took off from.  A single
>tear falls from her eye and lands on the Tenchi-Ken, which is
>lying on the ground in front of her.  It has two gems in it. AEKA
>looks down and sees the Tenchi-Ken.
TOM: And how did he defeat her then, hmmm? Think Adam, think!
CROW: So he totally screws up a part of a show that didn't really need
to be messed up so that he can insert himself into it later on....
<Looks thoughtful> Hmmm.
MIKE: What is it Tom?
CROW: I have a feeling that this guy is most certainly related to Chris
Caldwald! I'll explain later.

>                               AEKA
>               Your sword … <looks to space> your,
>               not coming back, are you?
>
>AEKA clutches the sword tight against herself.
>
>                               AEKA
>               <cries> YOUSHOOOO!!!!

>Camera pans outward into space, we see the planet Jurai
>Silently spinning, RYO-OHKI flies past the camera, covering
>it in darkness.
SAMANTHA: It had sprung a leak in its oil pan.

>                       A Twisted Plot Production
ALL: No doubt there!

>                            In Association with
>                            Tempest Creations

SAMANTHA: By killing him.
MIKE: Feeling dark?

>               Episode 3: What Dreams Are Made Of
TOM: What crap really is.
CROW: These are the days of our lives.
MIKE: When self insertion goes wrong.
SAMANTHA: How to annoy the creators of a good Anime series.

>Establishing Shot: Daylight, the sun beating down
TOM: The sun is a real bully.

>on the Masaki
>household.  RYOUKO is lying
SAMANTHA: Now who was Ryoko lying to? And what was it about?

>on the 'Newly Repaired' roof enjoying
>the sun.

>                               RYOUKO
>               Ahhh, <sigh> this is the life.  The warm
>               sun, a cool breeze …
CROW: A self inserted author nearby for me to kill.
MIKE: Now don't you start Crow.

>RYOUKO stiffens
CROW: Sayyyyy......

>and sits up.  A "Myaaa" is heard in the distance.
CROW: Oh.

>                               RYOUKO

>slides open the door and walks in.  AEKA is gripping the Tenchi-ken
>tightly against her chest.
TOM: Wondering just how the heck she was supposed to get out of this fan
fic.
SAMANTHA: Or kill the author.
MIKE: You're a bad influenza on her Tom.

>                               SASAMI

>                               AEKA

MIKE: <Scared voice> Adam.... is near by.

>                               SASAMI
>               You can't stay here.  For the last
>three days all you've done is stay
>in here, Tenchi is going to get a
>bad impression about us Juraians
>if we don't ever leave one room.
SAMANTHA: Like nearly getting killed by Aeka in the first place wasn't a
bad enough impression.

>                               AEKA
>               Tenchi … Well, I suppose I could

>
>Cut to RYOUKO walking on top of the lake as if it was solid

CROW: Which she quickly realized wasn't and fell right in.

>                               RYOUKO
>               Well, lets see.  This looks like

TOM: To bury the author....

>RYOUKO sinks down into the water.  Beneath the tides we
>see the wreckage from the two ships lying
MIKE: Geez, more lying! What is this? A lawyers convention?

>in twisted formations.
>RYOUKO paws through the wreck until she comes across

>ADAM
ALL: BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

>yawns and walks out of his room, his hair is sticking
>up all over the place almost looking like RYOUKO.  He walks

SAMANTHA: Mistaking him for a criminal, she takes out her gun and shoots
him. The end.

TOM: Which does not make sense since Mihoshi does not cook in the first
place.
MIKE: Whenever this guy writes, it's like the Mihoshi bashing hour has
arrived.

ALL: BOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

>ADAM quickly looks into the bubbling pot and takes a smell,

CROW: Meaning that he dies from the harmful fumes. The end.
MIKE: Would you guys stop that? You're getting darker then Darth Vader!
TOM: <Darth Vader> Join the Dark side.

>ADAM places a hand to his forehead and sighs.

series!

SAMANTHA: well guys, this looks like it'll be nothing more but just a
messed up version of OVA # 3 in script form. *YAWN* Give me a shout when
that idiot comes back on. <Goes to sleep>

TOM: No he did not leave it behind! <Head starts to smoke> He took the
Master Key with him and used it to lock Ryoko up in that statis pod over
sven hundred years ago! Damnit Adam! You saw the show! GET THE FACTS
STRAIGHT!!!!!!!
CROW: Careful buddy. You're close to blowing again.

it through this horrible piece of trash without blowing up.

Oh yeah. This makes allot of sense.

MIKE: Nice impression.

>                       TO BE CONTINUED…
ALL: BOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>Authors Notes:
>       It is very important that you know something.  While WE the
readers knows
>who YOUSHO is, the characters don’t.  While I've always called Tenchi's

>grandfather Yousho, it must be noted that Tenchi himself doesn't know
that his
>name really is Yousho, nor does anyone else in the story.
TOM: So he finally explains this in the *third* chapter.

>       As is quiet obvious, this is different in MANY respects to the
OAV Ep. 3
>that it was modeled after.  First of all, Tenchi didn't meet Ryouko by
>releasing her from the cave, he met her when she crashed into Earth
after being
>chased by Mihoshi.  So I had to make up something that would explain
how Ryouko
>was imprisoned AND still was free to be chased by Mihoshi.
ALL: BOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SAMANTHA: I already know this and yet, he still goes on.

>       Wondering where Yousho is hiding that third gem of his? Well, he
needs it
>to be near so that it can give power to his tree, Funaho.  But we've
never seen
>him with the gem hanging from his ear.  So where could that gem be?  I
guess
>you'll find out in the next part.
CROW: Pointing out the inconsistencies and errors in this fan fic is
like trying to defend Bill Clinton in a sex scandal.

>       Concerning the Voice:  This is one of the underlining themes in
the Full
>Circle series.  The Voice made a deal with Adam when he was younger,
somewhere
>around the age of 16 or 17 (i.e. - the "Magical Girl" age), that he
would do
>tasks for the Voice that the Voice could not do itself.  The younger
Adam
>thought that the Voice would call on him soon, it never did.  Now that
he's 22,
>he's sort of forgotten about it. There IS a reason why the Voice chose
Adam for
>this, and why he accepted, but that's another story.
MIKE: Which he will tell with excrciating, pain filled detail.

>       Oh, if you know anything about me as an author you can guess who
the
>Voice REALLY is.  And if you aren't familiar with my works, I'll just
tell you
>now, that the Voice is Setsuna-san, better known as Sailor Pluto.
ALL: AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SAMANTHA: Oh dear god no! He's gonna be bringing the Sailer Scouts into
this! <Proceeds to sob>
TOM: <Furious> Now look what you did Adam! You made Samantha cry!
Grrrrr......
MIKE: Well I was going to wait to reserve this for a special occasion
but it looks like I had better use it now.
CROW: What is it?
MIKE: You'll see.
CROW: Come on. Lets go.

ALL: <Get up and leave the theatre. Mike is carrying Tom in his arms and
Samantha is still cyring>

(DOOR SEQUENCE) 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...

Samantha cried into her arms, sat on the floor with Tom and Crow doing
their best to comfort her.

"It's all right Sam. The fan fic is over," Tom said.

"I know! But the fact that he's bringing the scouts into this... It's
too much," Samantha said, her sobs renewing.

"Well you won't have to endure the next fan fic Samantha," Mike said. He
came to stand beisde her and was holding Samantha's wrist teleporter in
his hands.

"Huh," the redhead replied. She looked up and saw the wrist teleporter.
"Oh I wish I could use that but Dr. Forrestor put up that barrier thingy
to prevent me from using it."

"Not no more," Gypsy said, walking up beside Mike. "Me and Mike were
working on it to get us all out of here but we realize that you need to
get out of here the most."

"Oh thank you Gypsy, Mike," Samantha said, standing up and taking the
teleporter from Mike. "But how did you and Gypsy fix it so that I could
teleport home so quickly?"

"Ratliff plot device," Mike replied.

"We'll miss you," Gypsy said.

"And I'll miss you too Gypsy. Just take care of these guys."

"And don't forget to come back and get us," Crow added.

"I won't. And thank you Tom. You helped me the most through this,"
Samantha bent down and kissed the red robot on the dome.

While Tom was hovering about like a drunken fool, Samantha activated the
teleporter and disapeered in a flash of light.

"Some bots get all the luck," Crow grumbled as he listened to Tom
blabber incoherently.

The red light flashed, indicating that the mads were calling.

"Hello sirs," Mike said after he tapped the button.

DEEP 13

"All right! Where is she? My sensors detected an unallowed transport off
the satelite," the scientist demanded.

Frank, standing behind Dr. Forrestor and looking grim, nodded his head
in agreement.

SATELITE OF LOVE

"Oh that was just Samantha leaving the ship," Gypsy replied.

DEEP 13

"ARGH! And you didn't stop her? Ah right! That's it! You'll be getting a
real stinker of a fan fic next time! Frank! Push the button!"

"Yes Clayton," Frank replied, tapping the button.

BLIP!!!!! FWOOOSSHHH!!!!

I'm not sure as to what my next fan fic will be but I hope it'll be even
more worst then this one was. Sure it was self insertion but the author
did not really do anything except contribute needless talk and inform us
that great pain is about to come. I hope I did a good job on that bit of
artwork up there.
