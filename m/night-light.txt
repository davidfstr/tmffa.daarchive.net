Night-light

A Tenchi fanfic by Keiichi Masaki (Keiichi_dono@hotmail.com)

Tenchi and company are the property of AIC and Pioneer.

	"G'night, sweetie."  Tenchi pecked his daughter on the forehead and toward the 
door.
	"Daddy?"
	Tenchi turned to look back at her.  "Yes, Achika?"
	"Could you please leave a night light on?"
	"Sure, sweetie."  Tenchi snapped his fingers, and a single Light Hawk Wing 
appeared.  "Now, how long do you think you'll need it?"
	"Hmm…" Little Achika Masaki furrowed her brow in concentration for a 
moment, then smiled.  "Two hours!"
	"Two hours it is, then."  Tenchi nodded at the floating blade of energy, then 
turned off the lights.  "Good night, my little angel."
	"G'night, Daddy."  Achika snuggled under the covers, falling asleep instantly.
