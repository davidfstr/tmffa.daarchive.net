TOP TEN!!

Tonight’s Top 10, is;
THE TOP TEN THINGS, THAT TENCHI MASAKI DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR.

10.  Washu:  Now where is my guinea pig?  (Melodic voice) Oh, Tenchi!
^_^

9.  Ryoko:  I'm going to cure your shyness, right now!

8.  Ryo-oh-ki(In full, humanoid form):  Forget the others!  I’ll show
you some REAL loving!

7.  Lady Tokimi:  You know, you’re kind of cute.  I think I just might
take YOU, instead. ^_^

6.  Kagato:  I’m baaaaaaaaaaaak!

5.  Yosho:  Yes, the daughter of a very good friend of mine.  The girl’s
name is "Saotome, Ranma".  If you were to marry her,

4.  Washu:  I wonder what ‘you’ would look like, as a girl?

3.  Sasami:  Oh, Tenchi.  I’m letting Ryoko and Ayeka cook, tonight.

2.  Ayeka:  Your father?  I think he, and Miss Washu were kissing,
behind the house.

And the number ONE thing, that Tenchi Masaki does not want to hear,

1.  Kiyone(Meeting Tenchi, at his school):  Um, Tenchi.  We have some
good news, and some bad news.
       Mihoshi:  The good news is; You don’t have to repair the house,
anymore.

I may create ‘another’ Top 10, Fan Fiction.  I still had more ideas!
