"Washu, Scientific genius"
by Jon Carlson
sung to the tune of
"Werewolves of London"
by Warren Zevon

********Disclaimer*********
I do not own the song tune or anything pertaining to it.  This is for fun,
folks.  No profit, no lawsuit.
Furthermore, I do not own any of the Tenchi Muyo characters.  They belong to
Pioneer Entertainment.
*************************

I saw a twelve-year old with some chopsticks in her hand
Long hair poofed up like a red crab on the beach
she was looking for the secrets of the universe
and found it in a big dish of beef chow mein
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!

If you hear the screaming under the big stairs
-better save that poor boy
little Washu got them magic fingers there
Scientific genius again
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!

She’s the spiky-haired witch who got a cravin’ itch
lately she’s been travelin’ though time
you better stay away from her, she’ll make you scream or purr
or try and make you call her -
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!

Well, I saw a space pirate walking with the Princess
along with the scientific genius,
I saw the crown prince of Jurai with the tenchi-ken
along with the scientific genius,
I saw a cabbit transform into a girl and to a little dance
and her hair was perfect
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius, Back to the drawing board!
Washuuuuuuuuu!
Washuuuuuu, scientific genius
Washuuuuuuuuu!

comments?  Suggestions?  It’s my first submission ever - all else I have is
a crazy self-insertion fic going on between me and a friend of mine based in
a crazy school of ours - The Arkansas School for Mathematics and Sciences.
It’s a mega-crossover with TM, Ranma ½, Ah! My Goddess!, and Goldenboy.
It’s actually pretty cool.
