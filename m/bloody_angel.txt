                                          "A Bloody Angel"


We are standing here
Just like a normal day
When you appeared
And took our lives away
You came to us, it's true
Just straight out of the blue
You came to us
And took our lives away.

I saw everyone scream
Then I heard an awful noise
And there was nothing, nothing
But pain, pain, pain
My vision is going.
Is this my time to go?
I cried a name, called out into the dark
I cried a name,
I cried a name,
I cried out to the one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
She is lying there
Her heart so full of fear.
She died, trying to save us
I stand there crying a tear
She was there
She was there

And she's an angel
A beautiful angel
An angel, that never had a chance
She died for us
And she lived for us
We were her world,
Her reality
Her only real chance
But she's dead
And I'm here
And there is so much to fear.....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I feel something
Something new
I feel a sensation
I never knew
I see them, standing over me
Feel the love
That surrounds me
And I smile, then I say good-bye

But I'll miss them
Oh so much.
They were angels,
Angels that could be touched
They are hurt
Some of them.
Bloody Angels
I'll never see you again
I feel the love
I feel the pain.
And I know
I'll never see them again

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here she is
On the floor.
We try to act brave
Braver than before.
But she's bleeding
On the floor.
And I never realized
She's an Angel
A bloody Angel
An Angel, only found on earth

We try not to cry
As she says good-bye.
We say
That it's not over yet
But she smiles
Oh, that smile.
She smiled,
Smiled and said good-bye.
Did the Bloody Angel.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My time has come.
I know it's true.
They know,
but don't believe it's true.
I smile again
My time had come
Live your lives
Live them young.
And live them
As I remember you

They say they will make it better
They say they will make it OK
But I say no.
My time has come.
If it's so,
Let me go alone
You're all angels.
Perfect Angels.
Angels, watching over me
Even now
When I'm almost gone
You're Angels
Watching till the dawn.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I close my eyes
And I can see
The day we met
I remember when
I first saw
You.
You were there
Cute, and beautiful too.
But now you're gone.
You're changing.
Your time has come
And we know it's true

Even as we watch
Dark and blue
You change
Into what you weren't
And what you were, too
You are more beautiful
Even now
You both
There
We can see the change
From young to new
You lie there
As sleepers do
A Bloody Angel.
A Bloody Angel.
We will stay here, watching over you
Our Bloody Angel.
You are an Angel.
We will stay here
As good friends do.

Epilogue: Tenchi walks down a path, branching off the steps of the shrine.
It is a cold, winters
day, and the gray sky predicts clouds. Tenchi hurries down the path, finally
coming to a small
clearing. In the clearing, there is a gravestone. Shaped like a cross, and
with a small Angel
carved into the side. On it were to words:

"Here, she lay
An Angel, to this day.
She died a martyr
That she did
And died as an Angel
A Bloody Angel,
Watching
From heaven
Today."

With a sigh, and a tear dropping to the ground, Tenchi puts a single flower
on the grave.
He leaves, and a white snowflake falls to the ground. It hits a red petal,
and the rose on the
grave starts to collect snow. The wind rushes through the sight, and the
only sound is the wind,
carrying musical laughter.  Laughter of an Angel. A hurt, bloody angel.
