Team Lightyear: to MST and beyond

Disclaimer: The MSTer's in this story are a group of characters taken from 
various T.V. shows that I enjoy. I do not own any of them except Kevin, who is 
me, somewhat. I do not own the fanfic I am MSTing. It belongs to some guy who 
wants to be knows as AAA-PhuckNut. Go figure.

My goal: To express my feelings toward various fanfics which I find 
distasteful or just poorly written and to make fun of said fics because I feel 
they deserve it.

The process: To ensure a complete MST experience I have taken control of my 
local mall so as to use the movie theater within. To prevent any outside 
interference I have assembled a team of flying monkeys and depressed circus 
clowns, all under the watchful eye of Ung, a neanderthal I found frozen in a 
refrigerator I bought from Circuit City. I have also gathered a team of 
enlightened and needlessly sarcastic critics.

Introducing...

From a small comic book shop in the quant town of Springfield: Master of 
sarcasm, The Comic Book Store Guy!
(CBSG): If your not going to buy something then make like my pants and split.

From an alternate dimension, though she now lives in rural Japan near a small 
Shinto shrine: The master of science, Little Washu!
(Washu): Do you prefer hands or...hey what the hell!? Get that camera out of 
my lab! 

From a dead planet destroyed by his own hands: Master of disaster, Lobo!
(Lobo): You get drunk, I'll get drunk, we'll have a night of hot sex and 
forget about it tomorrow, wha'da say?

From a lost ship on the other side of the galaxy: Master of my heart and soul, 
Seven of Nine!
(Seven): If you can not think logically, you should not think at all.

Finally, from somewhere in the United States: Master of his domain, Kevin!
(Kevin): That's right, I need more flying monkeys, preferably with ebola or 
some other easily communicable disease.  

The story has been chosen, the MSTers have spent the night preparing, the old 
people are starting their early morning walk through the mall,(after all, who 
am I to deprive them of their only source of socialization.) Lets go...
______________________________________________________________________________
-In the Lobby-
(Kevin): *frantic* Where is Lobo!? The MST starts in two minutes!
(Washu): Last I saw he was hitting the old folk for change to buy beer.
(Kevin): You mean 'hitting up the old folk' right?


<Lobo enters the lobby with a case of beer, a walker, three pairs of broken 
glasses, and a toupee.>
(Lobo): *Burp* Ah, nothing makes beer taste better than the feeling that ya 
earned it.
(Seven to Kevin): You expect me to remain within close proximity to that 
creature inside a darkened room.
(Kevin):*in a voice he mistakes for suave* Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.
(Seven): Let me make this clear, you have no chance of receiving an physical 
pleasure from me.
(Kevin):*Monotone* In that case your on your own. I hope you brought a phaser 
with you.
(Seven): I would have, but you forbid me to.
(Kevin): <grins>Oh yeah, well then I guess it's between me or Lobo then.
(Seven): Hardly, you said nothing against disruptors.<Pulls out large 
disruptor pistol>
(Kevin):Damn!
(Washu): If you will excuse me for interrupting your pathetic attempt at 
copulation, I believe the fanfic is starting.
(Kevin as batman): Quick! To the bat-theater

  Tenchi the Thug By AAA-PhuckNut

(Washu): That is so sad. Who would want to be known by such a name?
(Lobo): Ah ha ha! PhuckNut, Aha hahaha! That's classic.
(Washu): Never mind.

 (viperz00@winfire.com) Disclaimer: This fic contains sex and stuff

(CBSG): Ah yes, stuff. Now I know exactly what to expect in this story.

 so you have to be 18+ to read it. Also, all characters protrayed

(Washu): do I sense a phrenetic speller.
(Lobo): fernet...fen...what?

 in this fic are owned by Pioneer and AIC so I make no claims to the 
characters. 
Washu had been in her lab for a week straight, working on her newest, 
greatest invention she had made yet!

(Washu): Don't be absurd, my greatest invention is and always will be the 
vibrat...uh Ryoko! 

 Of course, no one else knew what she was working on though......

(Lobo):because she's been in her lab for a week straight, right!?
(Kevin): Very good Lobo. Here, catch the treat.<Throw animal cracker in the 
air. Lobo makes a diving catch with his teeth.>

 "At last! My latest invention is now complete!" yelled a very happy Washu.


(Washu):*monotone* Oh, I'm so happy. Yay.

 "My invention is so perfect! It can totally alter the personalty of a person 
in seconds!! I can't wait to test it out!" Washu chimed very happily,

(CBSG): It would appear that Washu is still happy. 

 yet devilishly.

(Seven): Not to mention evil.

 Everyone else in the household had been going on with their lives like normal

(Kevin): that's a contradiction of terms in the Masaki house.

, except they had been wondering what Washu was up to all that time she was in 
her lab.

(Washu): yeah right. No one gives a damn what I do.*sniff* All I want is a 
little attention.
(Lobo): Hell, all ya had to do was ask!
*SLAP*
(Washu): Was I talking to you spirochete?

 All of the girls and Tenchi, minus Washu,

(Kevin): Tenchi + Ryoko and Ayeka x Sasami, Mihoshi, and Kiyone - Washu = ?
(Seven): A very bad joke.

 were just sitting around in the living room, when Tenchi asked,

(Lobo): who wants to suck my...
(Kevin): Lobo!

 "Does anyone have any clue as to what Washu is working on now??" "Its funny 
you ask that Tenchi." said Washu, which to everyones suprise had snuck up on 
them

(Lobo): with a chainsaw and hockey mask. Oooo, that splattered!
(Kevin to himself): Why did I pick him for this?

 just before Tenchi asked his question. "Well, actually, I haven't created 
anything new, I was just cleaning up my entire lab a bit."

(Washu): But just a bit. I so do love a little disorganization.



 said Washu. "You took a whole week to just clean your lab?!" said Tenchi. 
"Well my lab does expand over the size of multiple planets!" said Washu 
proudly. "Oh, I see your point." said Tenchi.

(CBSG): There was a point? 
(Washu): Hardly. My lab is completely spotless. Anyone whose ever been there 
will tell you that. I don't know who this woman is, but I could have come up 
with a better excuse using Lobo's brain.
(Lobo): That's not the only thing I'll let ya use.
*SLAP* 

 Everyone else just didnt really give a damn at all anyways 

(Washu): See! I told you no one cares about me.
(Lobo): I...
(Washu): Shut up.

and had already left to just finish the rest of their day. Washu returned to 
her lab to admire her creation. "Well, Tenchi will be the perfect subject for 
my experiment! And the best part is I can do it to him while he sleeps! 

(Lobo): Oooo! Kinky.
(CBSG): That certainly does seem to imply some sort of sexual content, doesn't 
it?
(Seven):*disgusted* There is something very disturbing about the word 'sexual' 
coming from that man.
(Washu): I know<shudders>

That way I wont have to lure him down here and into a trap." 

(Washu): What are you talking about? Trapping Tenchi is one of my favorite 
hobbies.
(Lobo): Bondage and crazy gizmos? Double kinky!

said Washu quietly to herself. Later that night, Ayeka and Sasami were already 
sleeping, Yosho was at his shrine, Ryo-okie was sleeping on the living room 
floor, Washu was in her lab, Kiyone and Mihoshi were out on patrol and weren't 
due back for at least a week, Noboyuki was busy watching his porno flicks 
inside his bedroom, and the only people still moving about were Ryoko and 
Tenchi.

(CBSG): Thank you for letting us know where everybody is. That way we won't 
worry about them when the story has nothing to do with them at this point. 

 "Tenchiiiiii!" said a very horny

(Kevin): Don't even say it Lobo.
(Lobo):*mumbles* Prick.

 Ryoko as she glomped onto Tenchi. "Please Ryoko, im really not in the mood to 
screw


(Lobo): so how about just a blow...<Seven places disruptor to Lobo's head>
(Seven): If you do not refrain from finishing that line of thought I will BLOW 
your brain stem out your ears.

 around right now, I want to get some sleep." said an angry Tenchi. Ryoko 
pouted a bit then said, "Fine Tenchi, but just you wait till morning! I'll 
have you then!"


(Lobo): But ya can have me...hey, how come no one's stopping me?
(Kevin): We give up.
(Washu): It's too much effort.
(Seven): It's simpler to ignore you.
(CBSG): I for one don't have a problem with your crude, yet entertaining 
remarks.
(Washu): Before this is over, I'm probably going to have to kill you.

 Then Ryoko phased away, and Tenchi headed to his bedroom mumbling to himself, 
"Gee, I wonder what Ryoko will try to do to me tomorrow morning" said Tenchi 
in a sarcastic tone of voice. After Tenchi retired to his room, he had fallen 
asleep pretty quickly, the devilish little red haired Washu stepped out of her 
lab snickering to herself

(Washu): Do I really come across as evil to everyone?
(Kevin): Totally
(CBSG): Completely
(Seven): Indisputably
(Lobo):Yep.
(Washu): *depressed* Damn!

 as she head up the stairs towards Tenchi's bedroom. She stepped into his 
bedroom and quitely approached his bed, "Now lets see what type of personality 
I should give Tenchi."

(Lobo): How 'bout making it so he's not a queer.
(Washu): Tenchi is not queer!
(Lobo): Coulda fooled me.
(Seven): That, would not be difficult.

 Washu whispered to herself. "Hmmm... I need to give him one that would be 
very easy to notice, so I will know if it worked or not.... I got it!"

(Lobo): Sex machine!
(Kevin): Lobo, I think you've lowered this MST below the level of the original 
fic.

 Washu whispered very enthusiastically this time. "The classic American 
Detroit Thug Personallity! aka: ADTP" Washu snickered under her breath. And 
with a few clicks Washu's invention was ready to go, she aimed and fired,



(CBSG): and the poor boy was vaporized on the spot. Can we go now?

 and then nothing happend, Washu was very puzzled, "Wasnt it supposed to make 
a sound or something?" Washu asked herself. "I guess it didn't work... DAMN! 
and all that hard work too!!"

(Washu): Okay that's it! I can handle being portrayed as evil and conniving, 
but stupid and ignorant of how one of my own inventions work!? That crosses 
the line! PhuckNut, I am going to hunt you down and castrate you with my bare 
hands!

 Washu said that so loud it almost woke Tenchi up. Quickly Washu left Tenchi's 
room and returned to her lab, very angry at what had happend.

(Washu): Your damn straight I'm angry!
 
 The morning soon arrived and the sunlight shone in through Tenchi's 
window. A groggy Tenchi awoke only to be greeted a split second later by a 
naked Ryoko

(CBSG): Now there is an appealing thought.
(Washu): <still very upset> That's it! I've warned YOU about making remarks 
about or with sexual content! And that happens to be my DAUGHTER! < Washu's 
holo-top appears. She presses a button and CBSG melts into a flaming puddle of 
goo>
(Kevin): Dammit Washu...
(Washu): You want to be next!?
(Kevin): Okay, I think we all need to take a break.
______________________________________________________________________________
-Back in the lobby-
(Kevin on phone): Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. Okay great. How soon? Excellent. 
Bye.<hangs up phone> 
(Lobo): Any luck?
(Kevin): Yep, our new MSTer should be here soon.
(Seven): And who is this unwitting individual?
(Kevin): You'll have to wait and find out.<looks around> Is Washu still gone?
(Lobo): Ah don't worry none about it. Chick just needs to blow off some steam.
(Kevin): *sigh* I guess I'd better go look for her.<Leaves>
(Lobo to Seven): <grinning> I's guess it's just you and the Main Man now. 
<Disruptor blast hits Lobo in the face>
(Seven): That was a warning.
(Lobo):<smoking> Ouch.
______________________________________________________________________________
-Elsewhere in the mall-
<Kevin wanders around looking for Washu. Passing an exit he notices it is dark 
outside.>
(Kevin): Wait a minute.<Checks watch> It's ten in the morning, it shouldn't be 
dark out.<Walks up to the door and looks out.> Oh shit.<Kevin can see the 
Earth fading away into the distance. He runs off to find Ung.>
(Kevin to Ung): Ung! 


(Ung):*grunt*
(Kevin): We...we are...we're in outer space!
(Ung):< shrugs>
(Kevin): Don't give me that! You were suppose to warn me if something went 
wrong!
(Ung): *Growl?*
(Kevin): Yes, being launched into space qualifies! 
(Ung): *grunt*<shrugs>
(Kevin): *sigh* Oh forget it.<puts hand to chin in thought> This is obviously 
Washu's doing, seeing as no one else around here could turn a shopping mall 
into a spacecraft. Ung, do you know where Washu is? 
(Ung): *grunt, snort, grunt, grunt, growl*
(Kevin): Thanks. <Runs off. Finds Washu in the remains of Famous Barr, which 
has been converted into a laboratory.>
(Kevin):<stepping inside cautiously> Washu?
(Washu):*monotone* What?
(Kevin): Oh nothing, I was just wondering. Um, why did you blast the mall into 
space!?
(Washu): I've had enough of the Earth. It's time for me to move on.
(Kevin): Ooookkkaaayyy...did you have to bring the whole mall and all of us 
with you.
(Washu): Of course. After all, I'm going to need a stock of guinea pigs for my 
experiments.
(Kevin): I take it this means your not going to be helping us finish the MST.
(Washu): That's right.
(Kevin): Damn. Now I need to find another...<stops in realization>...did you 
say guinea pigs? 
(Washu): <grins evilly> Kevin.
(Kevin): <sweating> What?
(Washu): Well I couldn't help but notice that with me leaving you'll be in 
need of another MSTer. I'll help you find a replacement for me, if you'll help 
me with my experiment.
(Kevin):*very nervous* Oh I...I...I don't...<points> Look behind you!<starts 
to run, but a force field appears around him> Damn!
(Washu): Oh please! Did you honestly expect that to work?
(Kevin):*sigh* *Monotone* Alright, I guess I don't have a choice. What to you 
want me to do?
(Washu): Great! <points to large bulls-eye painted on floor> Stand 
there.<force field deactivates>
(Kevin): <walking onto bulls-eye> Is this going to hurt?
(Washu): Extremely.<Pulls large level> 
______________________________________________________________________________
-Lobby-
<Lights flicker>
(Lobo): Wonder what that was?
(Seven): a power surge of some sort.
<a few minutes later Kevin enters the lobby, smoking heavily. His clothes and 
hair are burnt and messed up, and static shocks zap him occasionally>
(Lobo): Whoa! What happened to ya?
(Kevin):*incoherent* Washu...*mumbling*...Washu...*Cough*...Washu...
(Seven): I believe he's trying to tell us that Washu is responsible.
(Kevin): *dazed* Washu?


(Lobo): <Grins> Man, she smoked him, eh?
(Seven):*sarcastic* You are as witty as you are intelligent.
(Lobo): Aww, thanks babe.<Seven rolls her eyes.>
<A portal opens and Washu sticks her head out>
(Washu): Okay I found a suitable replacement. Oh and I also brought tubby's 
replacement here as well.<Washu ducks back into the portal and pushes two 
people out. The portal shuts behind them.>
(Nagi): < Looks around in surprise> What in the HELL just happened!?
(Lobo): HELLO! <Puts arm around Nagi> Hey babe, hows ya feel about shacking up 
with the Main Man.
*ZAP*CRACK* <Lobo falls over holding his groin. Nagi puts her whip back away.>
(Nagi): Never touch me again.
(Lobo): Ow!
(Ken): Hey I'm here and I'm ready to prove that Ryu's got nothing on me. He 
may be the greatest streetfighter around, but if your looking for wit, charm, 
and good looks...<chokes to a stop as Nagi's whip tightens around his neck>
(Nagi): Seeing as I've known you for ten seconds so far and I'm already sick 
of you, it would be wise to shut your mouth if you wish to continue living.
(Ken):*gagging* Sorry.
(Nagi): Better. Now someone had better explain what is going on around here.
(Kevin):<stumbles to feet> *weakly* I think I can explain everything.
______________________________________________________________________________
-Several minutes and three fist fights later-
(Kevin): Now does everyone understand? <Surveys the room. Lobo, Nagi, and Ken 
are all bound and gagged.> 
(Nagi): Mhp! Mmmgggppp!
(Kevin): What?<removes gag>
(Nagi): I am going kill you in the worst possible way I can think of.
(Kevin): Until you decide what way that is, will you help me MST the rest of 
this story?
(Nagi):..............fine.
(Kevin): How about you Ken? <Ken nods> Great! Now I'm going to untie you all 
now and I expect you all to behave like civilized people. Except for you Lobo, 
just do your best okay? <Lobo nods>  
______________________________________________________________________________
-Theater-
(Kevin): Okay Nagi and Ken. You two caught up with the story thus far?
(Nagi): Unfortunately.
(Ken): Yep, I'm ready.
(Kevin as Kirk): Alright then...set sarcasm...to maximum and...show 
no...mercy. 
 landing on top of the blanket he was under and locking into a deep kiss with 
him, "MMMMPPHHHH" moaned Tenchi. "Im sorry, were you trying to say something?" 
asked Ryoko very seductively. "DAMN BITCH! you is one fine ass hoe!" beamed 
Tenchi.

(Lobo): Now that is more like it! The kid's finally grown some hair on his...
*Zap*


(Kevin): Thank you Nagi.
(Lobo):*choking* Can't........breath!

 Ryoko just sat there stunned at what Tenchi just said, that is untill Tenchi 
ripped off his blanket showing Ryoko his naked body and his growing hard on. 
Tenchi just grabbed ahold of Ryoko and slammed his cock into her pussy, "Ooooh 
Tenchi, Im so suprised!" Ryoko managed to choke out. "Whose yo daddy! whose yo 
daddy!"

(Ken): Whoa! Incest alert! 

 said Tenchi as he rammed her harder and harder. Ryoko was in total bliss as 
Tenchi fucked her, sending her into orgasm after orgasm. Tenchi blew his load 
into her, then set her down in the bed next to him and got up to get dressed, 
Ryoko just sat there dazed in mix of happy and puzzled emotions. Tenchi headed 
down the stairs and ran into Ayeka on the way, "Tenchi are you alright?? I 
heard some loud noises and came up to check and see if you were ok!" said a 
very worried Ayeka. "Damn girl! you is one white ass cracka!" said Tenchi. 
"E...x..cuse me?" Ayeka stammered out. "All yo white folk be hatin up on ma 
skin color, damn crackas."

(Kevin): Hold on! Now I'll admit, Tenchi has been pretty messed up by Washu's 
devcie, but just how in the hell does he think he's BLACK!?

 Tenchi murmured as he walked passed a dazed Ayeka. Tenchi proceeded to the 
kitchen where he was greeted by a wonderful smell, "What be cookin? it betta 
be KFC and biscuits and gravy or i gunna bust out ma nine and blast someones 
ass."

(Ken): Oh man, black people and fried chicken jokes. What next? Raping little 
white girls?

 Tenchi said to Sasami

(Ken): Oooooohhhhhh shit.

 as he walked into the kitchen. "Wwwhat?" Sasami asked. "y'all herd what i be 
sayin hoe!" Tenchi snapped back. Sasami started cry at the cruel things Tenchi 
had said, "Shut yo fuckin mouth biatch!" screamed Tenchi. Then when Tenchi 
noticed there wasnt any KFC or biscuits and gravy, he got very angry and 
pulled out his glock nine,

(Nagi): Right, and he got that from where now?

 (no gangsta should ever be without it! I guess thats why he has one)

(Kevin): Of course, why not. Other than the fact that he's been a 'gangsta' 
for less than an hour.

 "THATS IT MUTHA FUCKA!!!! YOU GOIN DOWN BIATCH!" screamed Tenchi, as he 
proceeded to blast her ass into the next millenium,



(Lobo): Whoa! Now that's just wrong! 
<Everyone looks at Lobo in surprise>
(Lobo): What!? I's may be a sick, vile, violent, rude, disgusting, disturbing, 
dirty, filthy, sneaky and just plain careless, but come on! Shooting up a 
little girl over fried chicken!? Even I's wouldn't stoop to that.
(Kevin to everyone else):*surprised* Wow, he actually has a moral sense.

 making a humping motion every time he fired a shot. "Straight up Detroit 
husslin!" beamed a proud Tenchi. Then Tenchi proceeded to steal her shoes,

(Nagi): For what possible reason!? The stereotyping in this story is 
unbelievable.

 and just as Tenchi was stuffing Sasami's body into a cabinent, Ayeka came 
running into the kitchen after hearing the loud bangs. Ayeka was totaly 
shocked at what she saw next, a pool of blood on the floor, and Tenchi shoving 
Sasami's corpse into the cabinent. "OH MY GOD! Tenchi what have you done!!!!!" 
yelled Ayeka. "Damn not yo cracka ass again! well i cant be lettin yo go to da 
cops bout dis one..." said Tenchi. Tenchi then loaded a new clip into his 
trusty gun, and before Ayeka even had the chance to run, Tenchi pulled up his 
gun and held it sideways, in true ghetto fashion, and pumped her white ass 
with a clip load of lead.

(Ken): Am I the only one who remembers that Ayeka can form a force field to 
protect herself? I mean obviously she didn't. 

 "Aint no hoes gonna be sendin me to da slamma again!"

(Nagi): Again? I thought Washu's device only altered his personality, not his 
memories.

 said Tenchi as he repeatedly shot her lifeless body. Tenchi then headed out 
of the house and up stairs towards the shrine. "YO, anyone home?" Tenchi said 
as he approached the shrine. Yosho stepped out of the shrine and saw Tenchi, 
"Ahh Tenchi you are here pretty early" said Yosho. "Yo dawg wazzup?" asked 
Tenchi. After hearing what Tenchi just said, Yosho knew it was time to show 
his true form.

(Everyone):What!?
(Kevin): That makes no sense.
(Seven): This whole story makes no sense.
(Ken): Why would Tenchi talking like a thug make KATSUHITO(his name might be 
Yosho on Jurai, but no one on Earth calls him that) revel his true form. He 
wasn't even going to do that for his mother if she didn't realize.
(Nagi): This is just pathetic.
(Lobo): What true form? Hey, can someone explain what's going on!?

 A bright light flashed over Yosho and when the light went away, all that 
remained was a black thug. 



(Kevin):*unbelieving* Oh God no! I...that's just....Ahhhhhh!

"Wutup mah nigga!" said Yosho. "Ma brutha! long time no see dawg!" said 
Tenchi. "Yo got yous a crack pipe? i gots sum crack rock in here." said Yosho. 
Tenchi then pulled out a crack pipe

(Ken): Yet another case of objects appearing out of thin air. Man, if all 
thugs can do that, why are they always stealing!?

 from his pocket and him and Yosho went into the shrine and smoked some crack, 
like the crack heads they are. "Yo nigga, lets blow this joint." said Tenchi. 
"I hear ya dogg." said a wacked out Yosho. Yosho then pressed a button on a 
statue, and a large garage door opened

(Seven): Garage door? The shrine doesn't even have a garage. 

 and a lowered purple 1977 LTD rolled out, it was one phat ride, sittin on 
gold spokes, hydraulics, and one phat ass sound system to boot.

(Kevin): I must protest the use of the word 'phat' in the descriptive text. 
It's bad enough when used in the dialog.

 "Check out ma pimpin ride, nigga." said Yosho. "Damn dawg, that bein one phat 
ride." said Tenchi. Tenchi hopped into the driver seat, and Yosho hopped in 
the back and proceeded to lock and load his guns

(Kevin): Who wants this one?
(Seven): It's not worth it.
(Nagi): Lets just hurry and get this over with.

 to do some drive by's in Tokyo. Just as Tenchi was about to drive away he 
said, "Shit dawg, fuck, i needs ta go pick up mah hoe" Tenchi hopped out of 
the car and ran to his bedroom where a still stunned Ryoko lay on his bed, 
Tenchi grabbed Ryoko's arm, which startled Ryoko, and head for the door, "Les 
go bitch, we be blowin dis joint!" blared Tenchi. Ryoko just nodded and 
followed along and they hopped into the car. Washu came out of her lab and 
headed towards the kitchen, when she arrived she screamed in horror as she saw 
Ayeka's bullet ridden corpse lying on the floor. Washu immediatly headed out 
the front door only to be confronted by Kiyone

(Kevin): Thank God.
(Everyone else): Huh?
(Kevin): *nervous* Oh um, well, I, uh...I didn't say anything.

 and Mihoshi, "Hi Washu! We are home a little early because Kiyone said we 
couldnt afford anymore food!" said a very enthusiastic Mihoshi. "Mihoshi, will 
you shutup!!" screamed Kiyone. "Oh my god! We have terrible news..." Washu 
said, but was cut short by a strange rumbling. "That rumbling is very 
strange... its too rythmic to be an explosion." Washu said, apparently 
forgetting


(Ken): That she happens to be the smartest person in the universe it would 
seem.

 about the news she was going to say to Kiyone and Mihoshi. Kiyone was about 
to reply, when all of the sudden a purple LTD came speeding around the corner, 
with the bass from its music rattling everything around. The LTD came speeding 
for them, and just as it was coming very close to them, Washu screamed, 
"SHIT!! GET THE FUCK DOWN!!" But it was too late, the LTD speed by and Yosho 
stuck his AK-47 out the window and loaded Washu, Kiyone, and Mihoshi with hot 
steaming lead.

(Everyone): What the hell!?
(Nagi): Correct me if I'm wrong, but Washu only changed TENCHI's personality 
right.
(Ken): And doesn't Washu have an energy shield? 
(Seven): I believe it's obvious at this point that the author doesn't give a 
damn about what makes sense any more. 
(Kevin): *sobbing* Noooo, not Kiyone. It's not right! Damn you PhuckNut!
(Lobo): Hey man, calm down. It's not like she was anyone important.
(Kevin to Seven): <grabs disruptor> Can I borrow this, thanks. < Blasts Lobo 
on full power> Anyone else want to bad mouth Kiyone!?<No one moves> Good. 
<hands disruptor back to Seven>
(Lobo):<burnt and smoking> I's got to learn to keep my big mouth shut. 

 As Tenchi drove away, Ryoko gave him head while he was driving, and Yosho 
said, "I smoked those cracka asses!!!" Then the effects of the personality 
device on Tenchi wore off, and he didn't know where the hell he was, and he 
felt something really moist rubbing up and down his penis, and he looked down 
to see Ryoko giving him one sweet blow job, Tenchi couldn't hold himself any 
longer and he cummed into her mouth as he let out a sigh of relief, but with 
all this action going on, Tenchi forgot that he was driving and they drove off 
a cliff screaming all the way down untill they crashed onto the ground and 
their car promptly exploded, incinerating all 3 of them.

(Nagi): Which is just ridiculous since Ryoko could easily fly herself and 
Tenchi to safety and Katsuhito shouldn't have any trouble saving himself.
(Kevin): Even if she didn't, Ryoko managed to survive a crash from orbit. I 
seriously doubt a car wreak would do her in.

 	All that remained was Noboyuki and Ryo-okie. Without Sasami around to 
cook the food, Noboyuki became very hungry and ate Ryo-okie raw.

(Ken): Considering that he use to cook for the family before Sasami came 
along, I highly doubt that.
(Kevin): And I'm sooooo sure that an animal that can turn into a super 
powerful battleship could be killed by an ordinary human.



 Then Noboyuki went to jackoff to some porn, he jacked off to hard and his 
penis ripped off. Seeing that he no longer had a penis, Noboyuki knew there 
was no more point to life, so he promptly killed himself. 

(Lobo): Even I'm not going to touch that one.

 THE END Wasnt that a very happy story?

(Everyone): HELL NO!!!

 Well I hope you had a good laugh, cause I sure did writing it.
