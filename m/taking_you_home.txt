<This songfic is basically a TM! music video of Don Henley's "Taking 
You Home."  It works best if you play the song while reading, so if 
you don't have the CD, you could download the song now.  The regular 
type are song lyrics, and the bracketed portions are the visual 
images.  A set of visuals correspond to the lyrics directly below 
them.  Warning: There is no continuity in this fic.  I use random 
moments from all the series that probably contradict each other. 
Don't take it too seriously.>

Don Henley
"Taking You Home"
<Inside Job>
Warner Brothers Records, Inc.  2000

<Scene opens on Ryoko sitting by a fountain at a park.  She stares 
blankly and the picture fades into a shot of deep space.  There is a 
battle underway between galaxy police forces and Ryo-ohki.  The 
camera zooms in on Ryo-ohki's cockpit and shows a laughing Ryoko 
firing on her enemies.>
I had a good life
Before you came
<Fades to Ryoko sitting in a bar with Ryo-ohki sitting on her shoulder.>
I had my friends and my freedom
<Camera focuses on a wanted poster of Ryoko on the back wall.>
I had my name
<Ryoko looks up and peers wistfully at a man and woman sitting in a 
corner of the bar.>
Still there was sorrow and emptiness
<Fades to Earth, with Tenchi finding an unconscious Ryoko on the 
ground.  She opens her eyes and smiles.>
'Til you made me glad
<Scene shifts to Ryoko fighting ferociously against Kagato onboard the Souja.>
Oh, in this love I found strength
I never knew I had

<Fades to Tenchi and Ryoko embracing after the battle ends.>
And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
<Ryoko grabs Tenchi's hand and they start running to the end of the ship.>
Take my hand, love
<Ryoko and Tenchi board Ryo-ohki.>
I'm taking you home
<Ryo-ohki speeds away towards Earth as the Souja explodes.>
I'm taking you home

<Fades to a battle between Ryoko and Nagi.  Nagi is savagely beating 
Ryoko, who falls to the ground and can barely move.>
There were days, lonely days
When the world wouldn't throw me a crumb
<Ryoko staggers to her feet and fights back with newfound determination.>
But I kept on believing
That this day would come

<Fades to Earth. Ryoko appears hovering before a surprised Tenchi.>
And this love
<She leaps at Tenchi and hugs him across his shoulders.>
Is like nothing I have ever known
<The two stand side-by-side, their arms around one another.>
Take my hand, love
<They walk off through the woods.>
I'm taking you home
<The Masaki home is visible in the distance.>
I'm taking you-home
<Fade to shot of the whole family sitting together in the living room 
as Tenchi and Ryoko enter.>
Where we can be with the ones who really care
<Fades through numerous shots of the family members doing things together.>
Home, where we can grow together
Keep you in my heart forever
<As the bridge starts, the scene fades slowly back to Ryoko sitting 
by the fountain.  She has her head buried in her hands and is sobbing 
openly.  Suddenly, a hand touches her cheek and gently wipes away a 
tear.  Startled, she looks up and sees a smiling Tenchi.  A look of 
joy and disbelief covers her face, her eyes glistening.>
And this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
<Tenchi grabs her hand and pulls her to her feet.>
Take my hand, love
<The two of them run off into the park.>
I'm taking you home

<The two of them are running through the park, grinning widely.>
Oh, this love
Is like nothing I have ever known
<Ryoko takes Tenchi's hand gently.>
Take my hand
<The two of them float off the ground.  Tenchi starts to protest but 
Ryoko places her finger over his lips.>
I'm taking you home
I'm taking you home
<The camera pans up and Ryoko and Tenchi are in front of the full 
moon.  They fly away towards the moon, their silhouette shrinking as 
the music fades out.  At the very end, an image of the smiling face 
of Ryoko appears on the face of the moon just before the screen fades 
to black.>
