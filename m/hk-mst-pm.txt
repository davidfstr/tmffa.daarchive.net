MSTer's note: Since we are MSTing a Tenchi fic and the Tenchi cast are
MSTingThe<> sign are the MST characters. The Fic will be : ed. * around text
is the translation of Cabbit. Thank you.

In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki,who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!!
Ryoko:Hey,babe
Ayeka:TENCHI
Kione:I'm perfect!
Mihoshi:I want eggplant
Ryo-chan:*Carrots are better than lemons*
If you are wondering how they eat or breathe, or other science facts,
Repeat to yourself it's just a fic and you really should relax,
For Tenchi-Muyo theater 4000
TTTTTTTTTTWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG
(Inside Starship-Ryo-Ohki)

::In the main deck of the ship, Ayeka and Ryoko are fighting over Tenchi as
usual. Ryoko is pulling his right arm and Ayeka has his left. They are both
pulling him in different directions::

<Ryoko> Tenchi is MINE Ayeka!
<Ayeka> NO Ryoko! Tenchi and I were meant to be together! Hah!
<Ryoko> Keep dreaming princess!
<Tenchi> Hey! Hey! Girls! Enough please.... I need to ask you two a
question....
<Ayeka> What is it Tenchi dear?
<Tenchi> Well, why do you want me? I'm seriously nothing special, what is it
with all of this fighting over ME!?!
<Ryoko> But Tenchi, I love you!!!!
::Ryoko hugs Tenchi and Ayeka turns red::
<Ayeka> ARRGH!!! RYOKO! LET LORD TENCHI GO!!!
<Ryoko> Back off, you purple haired jerk
<Ayeka> I'M WARNING YOU-
<Tenchi> STOP!!!!
::Ayeka and Ryoko both turn to Tenchi, stunned::
<Ryoko> Huh?
<Tenchi> I said STOP! As I've said, I'm really no prize! Jeez!
<Ayeka> What do you mean Tenchi?
<Tenchi> I mean that I'm a LOSER and you if you went with me, you'd be in
real trouble! I wet the bed for crying out loud!
<Ayeka> ::gasps:: YOU TOO?
<Tenchi> Uhh... Yes.
::Ryoko raises her eyebrow::
<Tenchi> And... and also... well.... I WATCH BARNEY!
<Ayeka>....Oh
<Ryoko> Oh come on! You're making that one up!
<Tenchi> Well, yeah but you get my point...
::Ryoko is about to answer but Kione and Mihoshi run in::
<Kione> Clay is sending another fic.
<Mihoshi> Lucky us...
::Clay appears on the screen::
<Clay> Today's fic is one of those lame ass crossovers. The worst part is
that it combines two things I hate: You all and Pokémon. Enjoy! MWAHAHAHAH
<Mihoshi> Pokewha?
<Kione> WE GOT FANFIC SIGHN!
::During the chaos, Mihoshi runs in the theater. Kione is about to run in to
when she looks behind her and sees Ryo-chan::
<Kione> Oh Hi Ryo-chan! Come in with me and Mihoshi!
<Ryo-chan>*uh.... do I have to?*
<Kione>Yes ::she drags her in::

pokemuyo

This story is retarded and boring. have fun

<Kione>Judging from the title, we should have guessed that....
<Ryo-chan>*You're going to pay for this, Kione*

It was a nice sunny day at the Masaki household, everyone just relaxing and
enjoying the weekend. Tenchi and the others were having dinner, while Washu
was in her lab working on her newest invention.

<Kione>It's a killer robot that seeks out everything rugrat and destroys it.
<Mihoshi>Where did that come from?
<Ryo-chan>*She really hates that show.*
<Mihoshi>Oh. Don't we all?

Sasami: Would you like some more rice, Tenchi?

Tenchi: Oh, thank you, Sasami

*Ryoko shovels the rest of the rice into her mouth, then holds out her bowl
for more*

Ryoko: Can I have some too?

Ayeka: RYOKO! That's your fifth bowl! And you eat like a monster! Don't you
have any manners?!

<Ryo-chan>*Bad Ryoko. No twinkie*.
<Mihoshi>Twinkie! Wow!
<Kione>::Smacks Mihoshi::You Idiot! All you can think about is food!
<Ryo-chan>*Twinkies aren't food.*

Ryoko: What?? I didn't have breakfast today!

Ayeka: That doesn't mean you have to eat like an animal!

*Sparks fly from Ayeka to Ryoko*

<Ryo-chan>*Oh, one of those fics, ehh?*

Ayeka and Ryoko: Grrrrrrrrr...

Tenchi: Would you two stop arguing?

Ayeka: We weren't arguing! I was merely stating that-

*BOOOM!!!!!!*

Tenchi: Ahh!!! What was-

*Mihoshi knocks the rice over onto everyone*

<Mihoshi>Um, I have a feeling I've been typecast.
<Ryo-chan>*As the dumb blonde type?*
<Mihoshi>No, as the pretentious purple type.
<Ryo-chan>*That's Ayeka*
<Mihoshi>Oh? Um, what are we talking about?

Ryoko: Now look what you've done

Mihoshi: *teary eyed* I-i'm sorry..there was just a noise and I panicked and
I didn't even know what i was doing and-

Ryo-ohki: MEOW!!! Meow myaa maiiooww!!

*Ryo-Ohki runs through the room and out the door*

Tenchi: What in the..

Sasami: Ryo-ohki! Wait! What happened??

<Ryo-chan>*Timmy fell down the well again*

*Sasami runs out the door after Ryo-ohki*

*BOOM!* *all heads turn toward Washu's lab, and Washu steps out
triumphantly*

Washu: The greatest genius in the world has done it again!

<Kione>Beat Dr. Clay at checkers?
<Mihoshi>Baked a delicious batch of choclate chip cookies
<Ryo-chan>*Made more messed up demon and/or cabbit people?*

Ryoko: You mean it's finished? Ooh! Let me see!

Washu: Right this way..

*Sasami comes back carrying a struggling, scorched, Ryo-ohki*

Sasami: Washu, what happened to Ryo-Ohki??

Washu: Oh, that. It's nothing, just a little accident in the lab. Even the
greatest scientist ever makes mistakes sometimes!

<Ryo-chan>*Like trying to smoke me*

*A little Washu shaped puppet pops out from behind her shoulder*

Puppet: You're the greatest!

*Another puppet pops out*

Puppet: You're the best!

Ryo-Ohki: Myaa!

Mihoshi: Can we get going now? I really want to see Washu's new invention
and we just keep standing here and what are those little puppets that keep
popping out from-

Gang: SHUT UP!!!

Washu: Follow me!

<Ryo-chan>*and Washu's newest invention is...*
<Mihoshi>A chia pet?
<Kione>Killer Furbys that disembowel you head-first?
<Ryo-chan>*No. It's a fruitcake someone would actually want to eat.*

*Everyone files into Washu's lab and stops at a giant machine*

Sasami: WOW! What does it do, Washu?

Washu: What we have here is kind of like a time-machine!

Ayeka: You mean we can go into that machine and come out in the past or
future?

<Kione>No. It tells you the time. Like a clock.

Sasami: Wow!

Washu: Not quite.. *a computer appears and Washu begins pressing buttons and
explaining her invention*

*Tenchi falls over*

Tenchi: Wa! Could we have that in english please?

Washu: It's simple, really. The person we are using walks through this
machine *washu points to a machine on the left* and I press this button
here..and the person's clone comes out of this machine! But the clone is
from the future! You see, the future of yourself comes out!

<Mihoshi>Wow, totally Fight club

Ayeka: Ourself from the future comes out?

Tenchi: Amazing!

Mihoshi: Can we try it?

Sasami: Yeah, can we go in, Washu? Can we?

*Ryoko teleports to the machine and studies it*

Ryoko: This is nice and all but whats the point?? I really-

Puppets: You are a genius! And cute too!

Washu: I sure am! So! Let's try it! Everyone in this way.. Tenchi, you're
first.

<Ryo-chan>*TO DIE. MWAHAHAHAHA*

Mihoshi..Ryoko..Ayeka, now you Sasami. Ryo-Ohki, you go in too. When you go
in through the front, just come right back out the end, that's right!

*Washu starts pressing buttons*

Puppet: You are amazing !

*everyone comes out and watches the machine*

Ryo-ohki: Meow!!!

Ryoko: Wow, that light sure is bright, huh?

<Mihoshi>Wow, a rhyme. YAY

Washu: Almost done!

<Ryo-chan>*DESTROYING MANKIND. MWAHAHAHAHA*
<Kione>Wow, cabbits are evil.
<Ryo-chan>*Shut up and give me a carrot. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE.MWAHAHAHAHA.*
<Kione>That wasn't the fic,that was me!
<Ryo-chan>*oops.sorry.*

*BOOM!!!* *The light dies down and 4 figures step out of the machine*

Ryoko: What the hell..?

Tenchi: *sweat drop* Ehh...

Ash: Brock! Misty! I think we're almost to Cerulean City!

Pikachu: Pika!

Misty: Umm..Ash, I think we took a wrong turn somewhere..

<Kione>So in the future we become the pokémon people.
<Mihoshi>Gee, must be bad karma.
<Ryo-chan>*That means I'm probably pikac-. . . AAAAGGHHH!*

*Ash Misty and Brock turn to face the Tenchi gang and Washu frantically
presses keys on her computer*

Ash: Oh Hi! Are you guys trainers too? We need directions to Cerulean city!

Misty: ASH! You idiot! Does this look like a trail to you? Does it even look
like we're outside?

*Brock stares at Ayeka's breasts*

<Kione>What breasts?
<Mihoshi>ooh,cold

Ayeka: What is the meaning of this?!

Ash: Oh WOW! Misty, Brock! Look at that Pokémon! I've never seen it before!
I'm going to catch it! Pikachu, GO!

<Ryo-chan > *Catch it and do what with it?*
<Mihoshi> ewww

Pikachu: Pikaa!!

Ryo-Ohki: Myaa?

*Ryoko teleports to Pikachu and pokes it*

Ryoko: What is that thing?

<Ryo-chan>*YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE! MWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!*

Pikachu: Pi-kaaa..

Ryoko: It looks rabid..

Pikachu: CHUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*Pikachu uses thundershock on enemy Ryoko*

Ryoko: What the..Why you little!

*Ryoko forms an energy ball in her hands and throws it at the Pikachu*
*BOOM!!*

Pikachu: Pikaaa.. *thump*

Brock: I like a woman who's fiesty..

Sasami: Ryoko, noo!

Misty: Pikachu!!!! *Misty rushes over and picks up the limp body*

Ash: Pikachu.. *teary eyed* you're going to pay for that! Misty, watch
Pikachu. Charmander, go!

Charmander: Char!

Ryo-ohki: Maiow!!

Ryoko: What the hell is this?

<Mihoshi>A fuzzy underwear gnome?
<Kione>The 5th Tele-tubbie?
<Ryo-chan>*Road kill skewered on a stick?*

Sasami: Oh it's so cute! *Sasami rushes forward to pick up the Charmander*

<Kione>(As Charmander)Hey kid, lay off

Ayeka: Sasami! Get away from that! You don't know where it's been!

Charmander: Charr!!! *Charmander uses scratch*

Sasami: Ahh!

Ash: Charmander, ember now!!

Ayeka: AZAKA! KAMIDAKE! BLOW THEM UP!!

Guardians: Yes, Princess Ayeka

Tenchi: Ahh! Ayeka, what are you doing?

Ayeka: HaHAhAHHAhaha

Guardians: Yes, ma'am!

Ryo-Ohki: Meow! Myaa meo?

<Ryo-chan>*So, that's where my carrot's been!*
<Mihoshi>EW! You can't still want it.
<Ryo-chan>*I don't know. Depends how hungry I am.*

Mihoshi: Kiyone's going to be really mad at me! I just got this dry cleaned

Misty: ASH! Pikachu's coming

Ash: Oh wow! It seems the tears of our love brought him back to life!

Ash: Oh, Pikachu!

<Ryo-chan> *Meet me in my room, 12:00, sexy!*
<Kione> EWW!
<Ryo-chan>*What? I'll bet it's true too!*

Back on the main deck, Tenchi is sitting alone
<Tenchi>Gosh it's quiet in here. Peace at last.
Ryoko enters, carrying a sheet, followed by Ayeka.
<Ryoko>Hey, Tenchi, you liar, I had Washu examine this sheet from your bed,
and there's no sign of the, er, problem you were talking about.
<Ayeka>So . . . . .
<Ryoko>He's mine!
<Ayeka>Never!
::They tackle him::
<Tenchi>Arrrgh! Maybe, I should start wetting the bed on purpose...

Original fic by Jade Ohki

MSTing by Hellknight, Lady Galaxy helped me out.

Please, no flames, I didn't do this because I don't like you.(I don't even
know you!)Not to be taken seriously. In my opinion it wasn't very good, and
I was looking for a fic to Mst everywhere .As you might also know, I have
made other Msts ,around the site. If you would like to read them, just go to
my profile. Thanks
