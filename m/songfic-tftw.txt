Goose:     Are these on strait?
Mysterious Voice from Nowhere:  No.  How did you put your pants on
_backwards_?
Goose:     It's the fashion!
MVfN:     This isn't 1994.
Goose:     Whatever.  This is a Sakuya fics so if you don't like Sakuya

I can never feel the way you do
But I want to so bad now
I can't take the way you do
But you're still inside me now!
SAKUYA!  (solution)
SAKUYA!  (I'll become)
SAKUYA!  If I can stay with him today
SAKUYA!  (solution)
SAKUYA!  (I'll become)
SAKUYA!  If it makes you go away
Still you twist another day of our lives
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind if it's right
How I let him get inside of me
Twist my life the way that you do
'Cuz I think no one cares now
Even if  I learned to numb you views
They'd still be inside me now
SAKUYA!  (solution)
SAKUYA!  (I'll become)
SAKUYA!  If I can stay with him today
SAKUYA!  (solution)
SAKUYA!  (I'll become)
SAKUYA!  If it makes you go away
Still you twist another day of our lives
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind if it's right
How I let him get inside of me
I will never follow you
I will never follow you
I will never follow you
I will never follow you
All this time I thought I was myself
And I'd never even heard about you
All this time I thought I was myself
And I'd never even heard about you
Still I you twist another day of our lives
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind if it's right
How I let him get inside of me
Still I you twist another day of our lives
And it sickens me to feel this way
Now I can't make up my mind if it's right
How I let you get inside of me
I have become Sakuya
I have become Sakuya
I have become Sakuya
I have become Sakuya

Original Song:  "Synthetic" by Spineshank

Discaimer:     Tenchi in Tokyo is property of Pioneer LDC and AIC.  And
Quite franckly they can have it.  I mean more money, more problems.  Ya
know?  Spineshank and thier music belong to um, it here somewhere, uh,
The All Blacks B.V.  Which is just as good, you can't make too much
money off of a c.d. of Tenchi songfics.  This fic, by the way, is a 5150
Fanfic Production.  And Is Property of Jake the Goose.  So who else could
possibly want it?

Desdemona slapped at the water with her hands and yelled to the sky.
"Can't you people be a little more goddamn specific?"
from  "WHERE IS JOE MERCHANT?"
