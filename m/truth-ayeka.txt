The Truth: Ayeka
Demigoddess Ryoko


The day started out as any other, Ryoko and I had our pre-breakfast 
fight over Lord Tenchi.  We only inflicted minor damage to the house
 and each other this morning. Of course the fighting had Tenchi running 
out the house to work on the carrot fields. Why do me a Ryoko fight so 
much you ask? Hmmm? Well for starters she attacked my planet.
<True she was controlled, but still.> Next my half-brother Yosho 
chases her to this backwater planet called Earth leaving me behind.  
Mostly though we fight for the fun of fighting. I know we go to far on 
occasions, however if we didn’t I believe we would  cause more 
problems when we finally snapped. Lately though all of our fights start 
over one person. Tenchi.  Can I trust you with a secret? I don’t know, 
maybe, I’ll tell you. Lately I have been asking myself if it is Lord Tenchi 
I love or is my love transferred to him from Yosho?  At first I would of told
 you that I love Tenchi, but now I think it may just be the fact that he is a Jurain 
prince that I love. Don’t get me wrong Tenchi is a great guy but I don’t love 
him like Ryoko does. She love him for him and doesn’t want him to change. 
 I on the other hand want him to go to Jurai and rule along side me.  I know Ryoko
 is really in love with him no questions about that. We have become great friends 
during the times we have spent in the baths drinking sake. She has told me over
 and over about watching him grow up while she was in the cave. There has 
been a lot of tension in the house as we near Lord Tenchi’s birthday. We all know 
that he will have to make  a choice soon and hurt at least one of us. I really can’t figure
out how Washu and Mihoshi feel about him. But never fear Ayeka is here. Sorry 
I always wanted to say that. I have a plan to get Tenchi to make the only 
correct choice.  What is it you ask? How? Simply hook Ryoko and Tenchi up. 
I know what your thinking. Just give up and let Ryoko win, preposterous. Well that’s 
part of my secret, she already has. I see it his eyes every time we fight or when 
she is abducted by yet another person how he’ll run off to save her. Oh, 
he would run off to save me too, but I don’t get those looks sent my way.  
The sad thing is Ryoko fights so hard cause she can’t see what’s there. 
Part of this is my fault. After all how times can you be called a monster, 
demoness, or a heartless devil before you start to believe it yourself. Then
 when Tenchi hit her to stop her from harming Mayuka it reinforced  the 
fact that he couldn’t love her.  Well this afternoon I plan on either getting 
Tenchi and her together or getting myself killed. Hmm, Tenchi should be
 home soon.

************************************************************ 

Tenchi headed up the stairs towards his house when he heard the voice of Ayeka 
from his left.
“You know Lord Tenchi, I will be fine if you chose one of the others. But I don’t 
have to worry because I know you’ll chose me.” with that she smiled and walked 
off.

************************************************************

Ok so that didn’t go exactly as I wanted but I hope he realizes that I will be ok 
when he chooses Ryoko. Now for the phase two of my plan but first to deliver 
these notes I wrote for Sasami, Washu, Tenchi and Ryoko.  Washu’s is on her 
chair in the lab, Ryoko’s is on the rafters, but where am I to put Sasami’s? 
“Put my what, Ayeka?” the young princess ask her sister.
“Here Sasami, but don’t read it till after dinner ok.” I tell her while ruffling 
her hair.
“Ok, well I’m going to finish making dinner now see you later.”
“Bye Sasami.” 
Walking out the door I see Tenchi trying to get out of  Ryoko’s hug.
“Ryoko get off Lord Tenchi this moment; do you hear me?”
“Are you going to make me princess?”
“Yes!”
“You and what army?”
“You are so immature, and at least while you were under Kagato’s control 
you had an excuse for your behavior.” 
“Yo....You d.d.don’t mean that do you?” Ryoko ask with the hint of tears 
forming in her golden eyes.
<Well it was now or never, Tsunami help me if I go to far.> “Yes I do.”
I saw her eyes glow yellow then red. Then her body shaking form the 
repressed rage. Ryoko grabbed my collar and lifted me above the house. 
“Ryoko don’t hurt her please.” 
I hear Sasmi call up to us. The others are saying things but I can no longer 
make them out.
“I should kill you for that; I won’t though. I better than that. Plus I 
value your sister opinion of me. I thought you were my friend, but now I know 
your only a back stabbing Jurain noble.” She snarled.
Ryoko set me back upon the ground and teleaported away. <That was close>. 
I turned to see the shocked or angry faces in front of me.
“What?” I ask in my most stuck-up voice.
“Why, Ayeka? Why did you say that to Ryoko?” Sasami asked with large 
strawberry eyes filing with tears. Then she turned and ran into the house.
“Ayeka, if you ever hurt her like that again, I will kill you if she doesn’t” 
Washu stated.
“Understood” I said to her retreating form. “Lord Tenchi?”
“Ayeka, please go inside. I’ll talk to you later; right now I have to find her.”
“I understand. Good luck Lord Tenchi.” I reply back as I head for the house.

===================================================

Well what do you think? Please send C & C to me at 
d3migodd3ssryoko@yahoo.com.  I am not sure if I need to write more about 
Ayeka now or possible come back and pick her up again after I write some 
of the others. Let me know what you think. As always I  hope you enjoyed
this story and will read the others as they become available. Thanks Again.
