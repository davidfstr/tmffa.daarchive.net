"MST3K, kills a lemon"
GenSao had no part in this, I simply used his name. (Is that okay?) Most of
these names belong to some far off company, but my own, and some very few
stuff.
Dedicated to the best website builder in the known universe, GenSao. (I just
got hit for sucking up again, doh!)

A MST3K of one of my favorite H-fanfics, simply because it’s disgusting.
Starring me,
(A-chan, a.k.a. Amber "Devil Caller" Stilton), GenSao (He’s the panda who
made this
website)....he had no say in this story. Vegita-sama (eep!) and
P-chan/Ryouga.(He’s cute as a pig....a dork as a
human). Let’s begin on why this story came to be....and how me and
GenSao..(not really) met.

Amber, five foot six warrior like woman with long spiked blond hair looked
about herself. She had been asleep in some sort of hyperbolic time chamber,
and where she was...looked much like an average modern day Japanese den.
Except...it had a panda, a little black pig, and a buff looking man with
hair much like Amber’s, all sitting on the floor cross-legged around a
low-legged wooden table...sipping tea and coffee. Amber’s over-riding hunger
for caffine brought her to the table. She was cold, yet she could’nt help
sitting between the even
colder-LOOKING blond man and the panda. "Hi!" Amber said almost too
emthusiasticly. The blond man grunted, the pig snacked on some candies and
GenSao sipped on a cup of steaming coffee. "Where’s the rice balls!" Asked
the blond man, almost viciously. Amber shook all over."That’s it, I’m tired
of the silence. I am GenSao I am a very powerful panda."
"Obviously..." Muttered Amber.
"I have called you here, to help me review one of the fanfics in my large
cyber-liabrary..."
"A FANFIC? Oh God no...." wimpered Amber.
"Let me finish..." Coughed the panda. " Were going to watch it, all of our
reviews, will be taped, and of course, I picked you for a special
reason in this devision."
"And that is?"
"For comic releif..." With that the blond man started clapping monotonly,
laughing histeracly. Amber’s eyes were wide. She knew, from the fact that
she studied anime since she was a kid,
"V-v-Vegita!" She shouted. Vegita let his head fly back as he laughed. Amber
shook. "Oh no,
don’t lock me in a room by myself with HIM!"
"I’ll be there..." mumbled GenSao. Amber shook her head. "poor me..." She
stood up. P-Chan oinked. "One thing though..." Vegita giggled. Amber’s eyes
were wide, her hands shaking.
Vegita splashed a whole paper cup of water on her. It was cold...she
shivered then shreaked.
"NOOO! GenSao, how could you let him do this to me?"
"I did’nt know!" The panda got up to stop it but then......Amber’s body
glowed and in a flash,
she was transformed into a 3 foot blue Pikachu. "Oh no...I hate being a
Pokemon...it’s so....DEGRADING!" Vegita laughed. GenSao shook. "I should
have never told you about her secret." Vegita pouted, then did the usual
"Be-da!" And ran off to a dark room. GenSao ran
after him. In her confusion, Amber (Now A-chan...because her trainer,
Sabrina named her that)
picked up P-Chan and ran after them.

        In the theater, with a screen of images, flashing at random,
quickly. Some were normal, some touching, and some made the watchers want to
vomit. Vegita sat down with a bag of popcorn. "It’s starting!" GenSao
manuvered around each seat, a box of doughnuts in arms. "This is for A-Chan.
It’s the only thing besides a straight-jacket that will keep her here"
A-Chan
shuffled into her own seat, holding P-Chan in her lap. Her loop pink
ear-rings, were now
weighing down her large blue rabbit-like ears. "If I have to do this, might
as well get it over with..." She mumbled, snatching a donut from GenSao.
"Oh, did he forget to mention...this is a hentai/lemon fic?" GenSao asked.
A-Chan shook all over.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" She shouted. Vegita laughed, P-Chan
held his ears and GenSao snacked on some of Vegita’s pop-corn. "On with the
show...." Shouted GenSao.

>Yosho, the old man who rapes teenage boys
A-Chan *Blaarf*

>By the super retarded kid from Seanbaby's page, ALIENBOY 52!!!

Vegita: When did he find out? Every one else knew but....

>This story's characters are property of Pioneer and AIC, except
>for Seanbaby. If you don't know who Seanbaby is, the go to
>http://www.seanbaby.com.

A-Chan: Odd enough, I’ve been there...
Vegita: Shut up woman, your ruining it!
A-Chan: I love you too (You over bearing evil son of a---)

>Also this story is intended for audiences over the age of 18, but
>who cares, it's hopefully so sick that no one would want to read
>it.

A-Chan: Hark....I hear me mummy calling "A-Chan, get out of that hentai
site!"
Vegita: Your 21 idiot...
A-Chan: Yeah, but I live with mum and she HATES when I leave my computer on
hentai fanfics
or pictures----
Vegita (Cluncks A-Chan on the top of the head with a balled fist)

>"Tenchi! Do it harder!"

A-Chan: (As Tenchi) But Grandpa....this is boring....
Vegita: Welcome to my "looooooove temple!"
P-Chan (Now being able to speak) You guys are gross...
A-Chan: (As Tenchi): When do I get to have my thing---
P-Chan: That’s crossing the line, A-Chan.

>yelled Yosho as he attacked Tenchi with his
>wooden sword.
A-Chan: Ooooooooh. I see now. Must of lost something in that fight with
Ryoko.
Vegita: (Laughing)
P-Chan: Oh Gaaaaawd.......where am I? How do I get home?
All but P-Chan: OH NO! NOT AGAIN!

>"Grandpa! I'm doing it as hard as I can!" Tenchi shouted back to his
>Grandpa while blocking the attack. Yosho quickly swung his sword around and
>hit Tenchi in the head. Tenchi fell onto the ground and passed out.
A-Chan: Erg....
Vegita: FINISH HIM YOU WIKED OLD PERVERT!
P-Chan: Is’nt that Roshi?
A-Chan: I think so too......

>Tenchi groggily woke up and tried to stand up, but his legs wouldn't
>move. Tenchi blinked a few times and was able to see clearly now, his legs
>were bound with rope to a pole, he was also naked and in his Grandpa’s
>shrine. Tenchi tried to move his arms, but they were tied up to a pole as
>well.
A-Chan: (Singing) Mama said there’d be days like this, there’d be days like
this my mama said!
GenSao: (Snicker)
>"Ryoko! Washu! Who ever you are! Let me out right now!" screamed
A-Chan: Orgy!
P-Chan: What’s that?
A-Chan: How old are you??
GenSao: It’s not that, it’s just...he got hit on the head by Ramna so many
times....
A-Chan: Oooh.
>Tenchi as he struggled to get out of the ropes.
Vegita: That’s the ropes kid...
A-Chan: God, what a corny joke, Vegita. If you were’nt so strong, I’d slap
you.
>"Hehehe, so you finally woke up Tenchi!," snickered Yosho as he
>walked towards Tenchi.
A-Chan: (As Yosho) for you are so stupid and niave, your like a mix of Son
Goku and and
Satoshi from DBZ and Pokemon....so I must rape you, then we shall be the
smartest pervs
alive! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
GenSao: (Scared) Where’d you grow up? In Master’ Roshi’s bedroom closet?
A-Chan: Actually....
Vegita: *Cough cough*
>"Grandpa!" yelled Tenchi in joy, "Hurry up and untie me! Someone
>tied me up!"
A-Chan: (As Yosho) I did, ya dumb ass!
>Yosho looked at Tenchi and grinned, "Tenchi, you fool, I tied you
>up. If someone else tried to tie you up in my shrine they wouldn't >have
>survived."
A-Chan: What’d I just say?
Vegita: One point, A-Chan.
GenSao: *Cough cough*
P-Chan: Cold between you two?
Vegita: No, it’s just we can’t think of anything to say....
P-Chan: oh.
>"So is this part of my training then?" asked Tenchi.
A-Chan: (As Yosho) yeah, what ever, just flip over and scream when I tell
you to.
GenSao: Your one sick puppy.
A-Chan: I’m not a puppy, I’m an electric mouse...
>"If you were a woman, maybe, but no, I'm just horny," said Yosho as
>he started to take off his belt.
A-Chan: Okay, that monolouge was not understandable to my feeble little
mind...
GenSao: I thought you were smart!
A-Chan:I was, until I saw the anime, Delinquet in Drag.
>"Grandpa! NO! You can't be serious!" screamed Tenchi struggling >even
>harder to get out of the ropes.
Vegita: If I were Tenchi I’d KICK SOME ASS!
P-Chan: If I were Tenchi, I’d run before Yosho GOT MY ASS!
A-Chan: both of you are ACTING LIKE AN ASS!
>"Tenchi!!!" yelled Yosho as he pulled out his penis from under his
>robes, "This will be fun!!!"
A-Chan: "Once you go gay you never go astray!"
Vegita: *Laughing sickly* Wanna be in my herem?
A-Chan: No thanks...I’d have to share with Bulma....
Vegita: Oh pooh.
A-Chan: why would you want me?
Vegita: Because your sick and perverted, your what you get when you put
Roshi,
Ryoko, and Madonna all together.
A-Chan: Is that a compliement or insult!?!?!
>"No Grandpa! Please don't! Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, and >even
>Sasami I can understand but why you?" pleaded Tenchi.
A-Chan: Right, little sasami....(As Sasami) Hey Tenchi would you put that in
me so I can feel better? Please? Please please please?
Vegita: (eyes wide) Keep saying please.
A-Chan: HELL NO!
P-Chan: (Passed out from an orgasm.)
>"Did you ever think why I let your pathetic father marry my daughter
>Tenchi?" asked Yosho.
GenSao: Ah, his first grammer mistake...........
A-Chan: ya’ sure?
GenSao: Not really, I just now started reading.
A-Chan: *Laughing wickedly*
>"You bastard! Leave mother out of this!!!" screamed Tenchi.
GenSao: He’s gay...I don’t see why he’d be making a comment about Tenchi’s
mother....
>"I fucked Noboyuki, and he was pretty good too," stated Yosho, >"But
A-Chan: He has an over-bite from HELL.
>still I've really been doing this since I was born on Jurai."
P-Chan: I don’t understand.
A-Chan: Neither do I...neither do I....
>"Ewww..." gagged Tenchi, "That's kinda more than I needed to >know
>Grandpa."
Vegita: Next we’ll be reading Sailor Uterus and Sailor Naptime’s secret
confessions.
A-Chan: *Laughing hysterically*

>"Shut up Tenchi!" commanded Yosho, "I'm going to fuck your ass,
>because right now you're my bitch!"
A-Chan: (As Tenchi) AW HELL NO!
Vegita: Hey, let’s go back to that role playing website. I’ll be Yosho you
be Tenchi.
A-Chan: Read the above ecchi boy.
>"NOOOOOOOOO!!!" yelled Tenchi.
A-Chan: Following responses by different anime characters: Ash:
Waaaaaaaaaaah! Gohan:
Nohoooooooooho, Mr. Piccilo help me!GWBOYS: ~All together~ Sure, we’d love
to!
GenSao: (Smacks A-Chan upon the face) And you call yourself a romance fanfic
writer!
Vegita: Yeah, every one knows that four of the boys are linked to each
other, and Wufei is a
wussy left over.
A-Chan: That gives me an idea for a new fanfic....
P-Chan: God save us all!
>Ryo-Oh-Ki was busy hopping around in the carrot patch when >suddenly
A-Chan: I ripped her head off.
GenSao: (In "baby got back voice") OH MY GOD!
Vegita: What?
GenSao: HE DARED SPELL RYO-OHKI’S NAME WRONG!!! ARG! I SHALL FLAME THIS
PERSON!
A-Chan: Down, simba.
>it heard Tenchi scream coming from Yosho's shrine. "MIYA!!" it said >to
itself
A-Chan: It? I thought Ryo-ohki was a girl..
>as it hopped towards the shrine. It could hear Tenchi getting louder >as it
>got closer to the door of the shrine.
Vegita: (in announcer voice) And next week we will issue out the hentai
video: "Cabbit----" (Is
abruptly stopped by the banging on his head he is receiving from both A-Chan
and GenSao.
>Ryo-Oh-Ki looked inside of the shrine and saw Tenchi tied up and
>naked. Ryo-Oh-Ki entered the shrine and walked towards Tenchi, >but it only
>took a few steps when it was picked up by the scruff of the neck.

>"Now now Ryo-Oh-Ki, we can't have you telling Ryoko and Washu >what's
>happening here can we?" questioned Yosho as he took his other >hand and put
A-Chan: (Singing) Your hand down my pants and I bet you’ll feel nuts, yes
I’m Siskle, yes I’m
Ebert, and your getting two thumbs up....
Vegita: My kinda song.
>it around Ryo-Oh-Ki's scrawny carrot fed neck.
GenSao: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
>"MIYA!!!" cried Ryo-Oh-Ki as it tried to break free of Yosho's
A-Chan: Puney old wrinkled liver spotted hand...
>powerful grasp.

>If Ryoko hadn't been drinking sake that night she might have heard
A-Chan: Something different then the Metallica record "kill em all" being
played backwards on a record player while a
woman is screaming in the backround.
>Ryo-Oh-Ki's cry, but unfortunately she had been trying to break an >old
record
Vegita: Yeah, mine.
>of two hundred and six bottles. Ryoko didn't remember if that was >the
record
A-Chan: Or was it three?
>but when she woke up the next morning from drinking she saw the >number
>written on her hand, it might have been an address, or an important
>number,
>but Ryoko figured if it was important she would have remembered, >so she
A-Chan: Tries calling all the numbers in the world with that area code......
>assumed that it must have been how many bottles of sake she >drunk, because
>she had a terrible hangover.
A-Chan: For a kick ass lab experiment, who used to be bent on all the money
in the universe, and is super powerful....she has a weak tolirence for
alchohol.
Vegita: So, Piccilo gets drunk on sour milk.

>Washu on the other hand was busy checking her experiment. Her
A-Chan: Nope, this joke is too easy to do....too cheap as well.
>experiment was too see if Ryoko could figure out what the two >hundred and
six
>on her hand meant. Washu figured Ryoko would never figure out >that two
>hundred and six was really how many brain cells Mihoshi had >multiplied by
10.
A-Chan: A public service announcment from Kiyone, Mihoshi’s fed up
partner...who needs
lithium.
>Washu was having a kick out of Ryoko getting drunk and trying to >re-enact
the
>entire war of 1812 before she passed out and fell face first onto the
>floor. But while she was having all this fun she forgot that she was
>supposed
>to be observing and she started to drink some of Ryoko's sake, >Washu
wasn't
A-Chan: Her real mother. (James Earl Jones) "Ryoko, I am your
mother....NOT!"
>exactly a good drinker so within ten bottles she passed out too.

>Mihoshi, well Mihoshi was being Mihoshi. Let's just say that staring
>at the clothes spinning around in the drier isn't exactly the best way >to
>spend evenings.
A-Chan: neither is writing rather amusing, yet sick fanfics....
>Noboyuki was busy looking in Ayeka's window when Azaka and >Kamidake
>ambushed him from behind. Noboyuki and the logs fell from Ayeka's >window
>and landed on the ground stirring up a huge commotion in Ayeka's >room.
A-Chan: *Laughs* Sorry that was funny.
>Ayeka stuck her head out of the window to see Noboyuki and >Azaka and
Kamidake
>sprawled across the ground. "REALLY MR. MASAKI!!!" was all that >Ayeka
could
>say, but none of them could hear Ryo-Oh-Ki's cry for help, except for
>Sasami.
A-Chan: Pretty Sammi, you better hurrty to the Sammy-mobile!
>Sasami was cleaning up the mess Ryoko and Washu made when >she heard
A-Chan: And she decided they were just rats.
>the cabbit's cry race through her head.
Vegita: Hold on a minute!
A-Chan: What?
Vegita: Why do you get most of the talking and jokes, and we hardly get to
respound to your
jabbering?!
A-Chan: Because I am the all mighty author of this MST3K.
Vegita: Ah, that makes since.
>"NO! Ryo-Oh-Ki! Yosho couldn't be doing that!" said Sasami thinking
>out loud, "but what if it is true! Oh no! Poor Tenchi! I'd better go check
>out the shrine!"
GenSao: Wait! I thought Sasami was too young to know about rape!
>Sasami quickly ran to the shrine to see what was happening inside,
>but she had a bad feeling about what she would see at the shrine. >She
>quietly snook around the shrine and looked in the door and saw >Yosho with
>Ryo-Oh-Ki.
A-Chan: Then every one busts out singing. "And everyone knows it’s Wendy.."
Vegita: (Singing) And Wendy has stormy eyes!...
P-Chan: Da dut dut dut dut dut da dut dut, da dut dut dut de da da!
>"Stop this Yosho!" she cried as she leaped into the room, "what >could
>possess you to do this?"
Vegita: (As Yosho) An evil alien, now go away kid, yer botherin’ me!
>Yosho looked back on the little girl and smirked and said, "foolish
>girl can you not see it! I am not truly Yosho! I am, JESUS!!!"
A-Chan: (As Yosho) Actually, I’m not Jesus, I’m the anti-christ on drugs.
>"WHAT!!!" shouted Sasami.

>"I will teach you a lesson for getting in the way of the devene
>purpose of my father!"
A-Chan: WHO IS BILL GATES!
>said our lord and saviour, Jesus, as he transformed
>and used his holy powers to bind Sasami to the floor.
A-Chan: Because of the reason that I am a Christian, (But I don’t like to
fuss over stuff,) the
rest will be edited out, becasue I’M GONNA GET FLAMED FOR SOMETHING I DID’NT
WRITE!

>And with that the super-hero Seanbaby saved the day, and later
>beat up Mega Man, but that's another story.
Vegita: You make me so angry.....(Starts to get up)
>The End

>Authors Notes.

>Yes I know that Seanbaby would probably never save Tenchi, but >still I
wanted
>the story to have a positive message while still trying to be a really
>sick
>fanfic. I probably would have liked to add more of a >Tenchi/Yosho(Jesus)
>scene but, I didn't feel like writing anymore.

>I probably wont write a Tenchi Muyo fanfic ever again, because I >must
devote
>more time to loving Seanbaby, and worshipping him.
A-Chan: (Getting up from her seat and streactching) That was interesting.
>Insult me at
A-Chan: 1-800-CRACK-BABY

>alienboy52@hotmail.com

>Or go to
Vegita: My place, we’ll get together, eat dinner and then go beat this
person into a massive, still breathing, bloody pulp with eye balls.
A-Chan: Ugh.

>Seanbaby's Homepage at

>http://www.seanbaby.com.

>Thank you, yes I know you all want to kill me now.
P-Chan: At least Vegita does.....
Yosho: (out of the shadows) How odd.
Tenchi: That would never happen.
Yosho: Eck. Naboyuki might try to pull a stunt like that...not me though.
Tenchi: (His eyes are the size of waffle house waffles)
A-Chan: And that's where I exit this place.
Vegita: I'm gonna phone Bulma and tell her to have something ready for me to
eat when I get home.
GenSao: (eyes wide with tramatization.) Guys, let's not do that again.
P-Chan and A-Chan: Agreed.

The End.......For real
