Tenchi could feel himself waking up. So he kicked up. But Ryoko wasn't
there. Tenchi was confused. He ran out to look for her in the the cave.
"AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Tenchi Screamed!

For the pool had turned blood red and inside was the limp body of Ryoko!
She was allready begining to look like the way he first met her as he
stared in horror at her repeatedly stabbed body.

"Shit! This time (incoherent)'s gone too far!" But as he ran back into the 
house, he screamed again!
"OH MY GOD!" For lying on the floor was Ayeka with several holes in her stomach!
He quickly ran to seek help from "Little" Washu. "OH CRAP!" Tenchi screamed for 
the 3rd time!
In front of the teledoor to her lab was Washu, lying on the floor, with a 
butcher cleaver lodged in her brain! There was a yellow hair on it.

"This is getting out of hand! Where's the Galaxy Police when you need them?" 
Tenchi thought as he wandered around
the house in a daze, only to find half his answer. "SHIT!!!!!!!" Mihoshi was 
there on a table, handcuffed and riddled with bullets!
"Where in this hell is Kiyone? No wait, I don't want to know. Oh, damn." Tenchi, 
not suprisingly, finds the dead body
of Kiyone in the bathtub. She appears to have her head hit on the faucet. the 
tub is full of blood. There are a few mirrors
here. He ran to get his father. "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!?" Tenchi had 
found Noboyuki and Yosho impaled by ceremonial swords! He ran outside to a trash 
can and sat on it, crying.
Suddently he felt something prick his butt. It was Tenchi-ken! covered in blood. 
He also found
a purple hair.

WHO KILLED WHO?




















SOLUTION:

AS YOU COULD PROBABLY GUESS EVEN BEFORE THE FINAL CLUE, AYEKA KILLED
RYOKO. SHE WAS SO JELIOUS, SHE WENT CRAZY AND WAS MOVED TO STAB HER
REPEATEDLY WITH TENCHI-KEN AND DROWN HER IN THE POOL. SHE WAS UNABLE TO GET OUT.
SHE THEN HID THE SWORD IN THE TRASH, BUT IN THE PROCESS OF THE STABBING, SHE 
ACCIDENTLY CUT OFF ONE OF HER
HAIRS.

IN HER ANGER FOR KILLING HER DAUGHTER, WASHU MADE A LASER GUN AND VAPORIZED 
AYEKA'S INTERNAL ORGANS.

MIHOSHI BORROWED THE CLEAVER BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW A GHOST. SHE TRIPPED 
AND LET GO OF THE CLEAVER. IT FLEW THROUGH THE AIR
AND AS WASHU CAME OUT TO SEE WHAT ALL THE RUCKUS WAS, THE CLEAVER HIT HER.

KIYONE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND TRYED TO ARREST HER. DURRING THE STRUGGLE, HER GUN 
WENT OFF AND KILLED MIHOSHI.

SHE GOT SO MAD AT HERSELF SHE HAD TO TAKE A BATH. NOBOYUKI WAS LOOKING AT "HER" 
VIA THE MIRRORS, ACCIDENTLY STARTLED HER AND SHE HIT HER HEAD ON THE

IN HIS PANIC, HE RAN INTO YOSHU AND HE FOUND OUT WHAT HE WAS DOING SO OFTEN AND 
FOR DISCRACING
THE FAMILY AND GOT SO ANGRY HE IMPALED HIM ON THE WALL WITH A CERIMONIAL SWORD

YOSHU THEN ACCIDENTLY SLIPPED ON THE BLOOD AND LANDED ON THE FLOOR WHICH MADE 
ANOTHER SWORD FALL OFF THE WALL AND IMPALE HIM IN THE FLOOR.

TENCHI THEN TOOK ALL THE WEAPONS AND STABBED ME. *GURGLE*
