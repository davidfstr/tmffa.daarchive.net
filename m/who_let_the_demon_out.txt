Diaclaimer:
(like a Disclaimer...but more DIAbolic!)
AIC and Pioneer own Tenchi and
have got fat and rich off the
profits of poor saps like me
who dream of being in a beautiful
house with five lovely women
somewhere in the middle of 
nowhere. Baha men wrote the
original 'Who Let The Dogs Out'.
This is not a compliment.

Notes: This isn't one of my best
song parodies, as writing a good
parody depends on having a good
song to start with. It was also
written as a deal with Ian (THE
LORD MIGHTY ERASER OF DOOM) Sagat,
so it wasn't my choice. Still, 
it's got to be better than the original,
ne?

      HAHA MEN - 
WHO LET THE DEMON OUT?

Yosho: Who let the demon out?    
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        

Chorus:
Who let the demon out {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out {mya, mya, mya, mya}        

{mya, mya, mya, mya}        

Tenchi:
When I smashed into the shrine, there was this flash 
of lightnin'  
{Hey, Yippie, Ouch, Oh}
And everybody screams and yells                     
{Hah! No!  Yippie Ow Oh}
I tell my Grandpa "...I'm not doin' any fightin''..."
{Yippie Ow Oh}
And then the sound of those school bells 
He was gone when I turned round

Chorus:
Who let the demon out    {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out    {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out    {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out    {mya, mya, mya, mya}        

Tenchi:
I see a little sword hilt lyin' on a rock
She really want to fight me
Get back in there, demon with cyan hair  
Get back you care-less queen bee

Instrumental Chorus:
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        
{mya, mya, mya, mya}        

Tenchi:
I'm gonna tell                                    
{Ouch, Yippie, Ow, Oh}
To any girls falling from the skyline                 
{Yippie, Ow, Oh}
Tell them "Stay man, your part of the Party!" 
{Yippie Ow, Oh}
I fetched demon in front with her cabbit behind    
{Yippie, Ow, Oh}
And my luck runs out even before it's started

Nobiyuki:
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        

Chant (Ayeka, Ryoko, Sesami, Kiyone, Mihoshi):
Say,    
A demon is nuttin' if she don't have a tomb    
All those women follow soon, 
all you follow 
A princess is nuttin' if she don't have a comb     
She'll come tommorow to mah home, 
all my sorrow come tomorrow

Tenchi:
All my god- is that a beam comin' from her palm?
Damn I gotta fight the girl I got my mind on
Do you see the sparks comin' from her gems
Whay could we just be best friends?
That Hentai girl-  she's breakin' me down
I don't wanna fight in my black button coat
It's not my fault, I'm a Judas Goat
I'm figurin' that's why they call me Tenchi
'Cause I'm in Heaven on Earth
But when I the girls see me...on nooooooooo!

Washu (with Megaphone):
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}        
Who let the demon out?   {mya, mya, mya, mya}      

Tenchi: I did!

THE END  

And that's it. Well, I told you it wasn't good,
didn't I? What were you expecting? T.S. Elliot?
Anyways, thanks to all who read it- it keeps 
my ego larger than my bank balance 
(i.e. nothing) and I would appreciate 
some C&C.
		ONE LAST WORD:
	!!!!WON SCIF S'TAGAS NAI DAER 
Who says if you play a fic backwards there's no
satanic messages?
Yrs.
