     Another sunny day at the
gallery(www.geocities.com/jakethegoose2069/fanart), and our friends have
come
under their own free will to view another exclusive screening of one
of Jake's fics.

Arlene<handcuffed and being forcefully escorted by Kiyone & Mihoshi>:
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!  I'M A U.S. MARINE!
Goose:     Thank you ladies, can I get her gun off you?
Kiyone:     Here, take it.  I'm gonna need you to sign these release
forms.
Mihoshi<looking at a pic on the wall(it's an art gallery after all)>:
Wow!  Kiyone, look at how pretty he made me! [shameless self
promotion]
Kiyone:     Yeah.  He didn't do to bad on My portrait either.  [More
shameless self promotion]<to Goose> Say, you think you could get Luna
to pick a love song for me and Tenchi?  [Still more shameless self
Promotion]
Goose:     I'll see what I can do.  Thanks again.
Luna:     So, they found her, huh?
Charlie:     Can we leave the cuffs on her?
Goose:     'Fraid not

     Luna flips the sign to 'closed' as Goose and Charlie push Arlene
through a door marked EMPLOYEES ENYA.

Charlie:     What happened there?
Goose:     Someone switched my Linkin Park.
Luna:     You should've seen the look on your face!

     Luna perches on the left arm of the couch, Goose uncuffs Arlene
and sits between her and Luna.   Charlie takes the right end of the
couch.

Goose:     Guys, just to let ya know, I won't be doin' to much today.
Just explainin' things the best I can.
Luna & Charlie:   Uh oh.

>Thread (pushed out into camera veiw):

Luna:  Already?  Who the hell is that?
Goose:     Ditch's* predecessor.
Charlie:     And who was Ditch?
Goose:     Figment of my imagination.
(*appears in "The Inevitable Return of ? ? ?"  & the M.S.T. of it--Luna)

>                                                             Um, yes, I'm
>Thread: the great elven knight, and

Arlene:     So why's he call himself a knight?
Goose:     I wish I knew.

>this is a 5150 Fanfic Production. 5150 and it's owner(s)

Luna & Goose:     That's us!

Charlie:     Well, at least you know your no Hemmingway.

Arlene<tilting Goose's head and looking into his ear>:     Are they still in
there!?!
Goose:  Ouch!  Quit it!

>                        at goose20693@aol.com.

Luna:     No they can't.

>                                  And now, our feature presentation...

>^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^

Arlene:     What are you Smiling at?  The disclaimer's Barely over and
my headache's already back.

>     It was mid morning. Tenchi was going down to Washu's lab. Why was he
>going to Washu's lab?

All:     Why WAS he going down to Washu's lab?

>                     Because she promised that she would invent him a
>ladder so he could climb out of plot holes.

Luna:   You can do that with a Ladder?
Goose:     Even if you can't, do you think it would matter here?
Luna:     Good point.

>Tenchi: Little Washu! Is the ladder ready yet? Washu: No, I decided to let
>Mihoshi play with the dimensional tuner instead. Tenchi: Why? We already
>used the dimensional tuner.

Charlie<as Washu>:     Because I didn't get to play last time!
Goose:     Wish I'd've thought of that.
Arlene:     A double contraction?  Can You do that?

>Washu: Because the writer of this fic isn't very good, so instead of
>thinking of a plot that is engaging and emotionally fulfilling, he's going
>to let Mihoshi ruin something and try to make a lot of jokes about it.

Charlie:     Goose, are you frequently in the habit of insulting
yourself?
Goose:     I'm the self-abusement director.

>Tenchi: Will that solve the problem with the plot holes? Mihoshi: Actually,
>it will cause more plot holes, a couple at first, but after a while the
>plot holes will become so numerous that they will eventually shred the
>fragile fabric of our dimension. Everything will become confusingly
>distorted and then we will all die horrible deaths. Washu and Tenchi:
>(Blink, Blink)

Luna:     Who was that again?

>Mihoshi: Ella is a soft kitty! (She hugs Ella [Ella is a cat/girl]) Ella:
>Ack! How did I get here?!

Arlene:     Forget that.  Who the hell is Ella?
Goose:     A waste of space.

>Mihoshi: I found you in a plot hole, remember. (Ella disappears) Tenchi:
>(Opens his mouth to ask a question)... Washu: Don't ask, you might get an
>answer.

Arlene:     Sound advice.

>                              Mihoshi, are you done playing with the
>dimensional tuner yet? Mihoshi: All set!! (The lab starts to shake,
>warnings go off on the dimensional tuner, and >everyone rushes into Washu's
>lab.)

Luna:     Yeah, something bad starts happening and you run TOWARD it.

>Ayeka (screaming): Tenchi hold me! Ryoko (same): Ayeka hold me!

Charlie<screaming>:     YEAH Ayeka!  Hold her!
Arlene:    <Gabs Her AB-10 form Goose and Cracks Charlie in the Head
with it>

>Sasami (Yup! She's screaming to!): I didn't get a chance to have a hot and
>freaky lemon scene with Super Saiyan (or Saiya-jin, I'm not sure) Gohan!
>Oh, wait, yes I did! Never mind!

Arlene:     WHO WROTE THAT?
Goose<nervously>:     Haha, um, hoohooo!
Arlene:     Oh no.

>Kiyone: What happened?

Arlene:     Jake wrote a Sasami lemon scene.

>Tenchi: Mihoshi played with the dimensional tuner, then she made some smart
>talk, then she said that the world was gonna end and we're all gonna die!
>Kiyone (now she's screaming!): But I didn't get a chance to confess my
>undying love for

Goose:     Pink Jelly Beans!
Luna:     I thought you were gonna sit this one out?
Goose:     And we saw what happened to that.

>Little Washu!  Little Washu, will you marry me before the end of the world?
>Mihoshi: Um, Kiyone...

Charlie<as Mihoshi>:     You said that in front of everybody.
Goose<as Kiyone>:      D'OH!
Arlene:     After all that nice crap they said about your stupid
pictures.

>Kiyone (she's still screamin'): Fine, you can marry me to, Mihoshi!

Luna<as Mihoshi>:     You stupid bitch, That's supposed to be a secret!

>Mihoshi: Kiyone, according to the calculations Little Washu will come up
>with after I say something cute and out of context, The world won't come to
>an end for another seventy years. In that time she will have found a way to
>mend the plot holes and save the world. Everyone: (Blink, Blink)

Arlene:     I'll be damned, Lobotomies can be reversed.

>Mihoshi: Is Sailor Moon on yet? Washu (looking at a computer screen): OH
>DEAR GOD NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Noboyuki: What is it, Little Washu? Is the
>world ending? Washu: NO, worse!

Goose<as Washu>:    I invested in Enron!!

>Cammy: What's worse than that? Ryoko: Where did you come from? Cammy: I
>fell out a plot hole. (falls into a plot hole) Washu: Mihoshi was RIGHT!
>But Kiyone, I WILL marry you! Kiyone: WOO-HOO! (She does an I.R. Baboon
>victory dance [no, she isn't wearing any pants].)

Charlie & Goose:     WOO-HOO!  <Yes, they are wearing pants.>
Arlene:     <Cracks Charlie with her AB-10>
Charlie:     What a bout him?!
Arlene:     It's not his fault.
Goose:     I don't like the sound of that.

>Ayeka: A blue window opens and a boy falls out. He is about Washu's height,
>wearing a green jacket,and has tiny feet.

Luna:     Why did she say that?

>Serra (you remember, the director): NO! NO! NO! Ayeka, that's the
>narrator's line!

>     A blue window...

>Serra: NO! She already read that! Just wait for the next one! Ed: (When he
>talks, he yells for no reason): I AM THE BRAINLESS ZOMBIE WITH NO BRAIN!!!

Luna<as Serra>:     NO!  NO! NO! That's Goose's Line!
Arlene:     Have you no shame?  Making fun of the sick!

>Chun-Li: Who is this guy? Ryoko: Did you fall out of a plot hole to?

Charlie:     Enya, I mean only makes sense.
Luna:     Enya thing that does.
Arlene<grabs Goose's Head and holds it to her chest>:     You leave him
alone!
Goose<undrstandably muffled>:     Should I be exited or scared?

>Ayeka: She's not Chun-Li, She's Lady Une in disguise! Chun-Li... I mean
>Lady Une: Curses, Foiled again!

Luna:     That doesn't sound like Lady Une or Chun-Li.
Goose:     What part off 'Frequent OOC outbursts' did you not
understand?
Luna:    Um,  what does OOC mean?
Goose:     You serious?  <Luna nods>  Oh, Out of Character.

>     ...Never running from a real fight!... What! Oh, they beat up Lady
>Une, Wrap her in tin-foil

Charlie:     Why?

>       (because she said "foiled again")

Charlie:     Ask a stupid question.
Goose:     The question was valid.  The answer was stupid long before
you asked.

>                              and then they threw her out a plot hole.

>Yosho (who is young for no reason): So, young man, like Lady Une said, who
>are you?

>     She is the one named Sailor Moon!

Luna:     I bet you thought you had nothing to gain from Sailor Moon,
did you?
Goose:     If nothing else, it's background info on where other people
are coming from.

>Serra: NOone was talking to you! Ed: I am Ed! I live in a foundation!

Charlie<as Ed>:     . . . For the blind.  Can I Feel you u. . . I mean
touch you to see what you look like?
Goose:     So when WAS the last time you saw 'Dude, Where's My Car'?

>Ryoko: How do we understand him? He's speaking english.

Arlene:     Come to think off it, How do WE understand YOU?

>Washu: Because we're from the dubbed version of the show. (See, I explained
>everything and nothing at the same time!-- Jiaq)

Goose:     Well, I got more explaining to do.  The next line is all
wrong.
Luna:     This whole fic is wrong.  How did you notice?

>Ed: Ryoko is Pretty, like A seventy-three Pacer!

Charlie:     Okay, educate us.
Goose:     They didn't start making Pacers 'til 75'.
Luna:     Mihoshi is a genius, Characters are falling in and out
of 'plot holes' left and right,and you drove a truck through the fourth
wall.  And you're worried about a 73' Pacer?
Arlene:     <Holding Goose's head to her chest>  He's obviously not in
control of his judgment.  They are.
All-Arlene<Goose muffled>:     Who?

>Ryoko: Tenchi! How come you never sweet talk me like that! Ed: Ayeka's
>breasts are small, so her bras are cheaper! Ayeka: That's so sweet, lord
>Ed!

Charlie:     When I try that line I get. . .
Arlene:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with her AB-10>
Charlie:     Yeah, that's about it.

>Ed: Sasami's eyes are sparkly, like the rayguns in "MUTANTS WITH RAYGUNS"
>part four!

Luna:     Which one was that?
Goose:     The Mutants rent a van and hit Spring break.
Luna:     Isn't that the plot to 'Mutants with Rayguns 1'?
Charlie:     . . . And 2, and 5, and 7. . .

>Sasami: Oh wow! Grandfather, can I marry him? Yosho: Why are you asking me?
>I'm not your grandfather. Oh what the hell, All three of you girls can
>marry Ed!

Luna<as Yosho>:     No need to find out what kind of guy he is, or how
he intends to support three wives's, or ask anyone's parents. . .

>Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami: Hoorah!

Charlie:     Hoorah?  Who says Hoorah anymore?

>                                   ED! ED! ED! ED! ED! ED! ED! ED! ED!

Goose:     Secret's out.  Sasami, Ayeka, and Ryouko are Catarl-Catarl.
Luna<into the camera>:     If you got that joke, e-mail me.

>Tenchi: Wait, Ryoko, he called you a car! Ayeka, he called you flat
>chested! Sasami: Tenchi, don't be a sore LOSER! Tenchi: Sasami! Your only
>EIGHT-YEARS-OLD!

Goose<as Sasami>:     Oh, and you were never 'At the Carrot Patch'?
All+Goose:     <Shudder>  Ooooo! >_<

>Sasami: Yeah! But he's only about twelve so it's o.k.! Yosho: Come on,
>Kiyone, Washu, and Mihoshi, I'll doo your wedding as well!

Charlie<as Yosho>:     Dude!  Six chicks at once!
Arlene:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with her AB-10>
Luna:     That's it!  Give me that gun Arlene!
Arlene:     Here.
Luna:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with Arlene's AB-10>

>Tenchi: Kiyone, can i be in your marriage?

Luna<as Kiyone>:     HELL NO!  You can piss Ryoko off all by yourself!

>Kiyone: No because you were so wrapped up in Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami, that
>you ignored us! Mihoshi: Wait, we need a fourth so we can play basketball
>with Ryoko's marriage.

Charlie:     I didn't realize you liked basketball, Goose.
Goose:     I don't.  But If they were playing hockey they couldn't play
shirts and skins.
Luna:     <Cracks Goose in the head with Arlene's AB-10>
Arlene:     Give me that!  <Holds Goose's head to her chest again>  Are
you okay?
Goose<muffled>:     I think my pants are shrinking.

>Washu: We will marry Erica: the goddess of caffeinated beverages, because
>she is sexy and can play basketball better than Tenchi! Erica, will you
>marry us?! Erica: Yes! Yes I will marry you!

Luna:     Jake, why is one of your alter egos getting into a four-way
lesbian marriage?
Goose:     It's like my father often says, "I'm just a lesbian trap in
a man's body".
Charlie:     Sanders, give me that gun.  I'll crack Myself in the head!

>Noboyuki and Yosho: HAHA! HAHA! Tenchi's all alo-one!

Goose and Charlie<get up and dance>:     HAHA! HAHA! Tenchi's all alo-
one!

>Tenchi: You guys are alone to.

Charlie:     I'm just layin' low.
Arlene:     <Hold Goose's head to her chest>  Leave him alone you alien
freak!
Goose<you know>:     Can't breathe!

>Noboyuki: No we're not! I jumped through a plot hole and now your mother is
>alive! Yosho: I jumped through a plot hole and killed my father and married
> >my mother!

Luna:     In the grand tradition of the Jerry Springer show.

>Funaho: Come here you handsome piece of MAN-CANDY!!

All<shudder>:     Ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

>Noboyuki, Achika, Yosho and Funaho: Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all
>alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-
>one!

Luna:     Why not?
All:     <Get up and dance>  Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-
one! Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-one! Tenchi's all alo-one!

>Magical Fanfic elves: Don't woory, Tenchi, we're still here for you!

Charlie:     The Evergreen Cortex never fails to influence you.  Does
he?
Luna:     Woory?
Arlene:     It's woorse than I thought!
Goose<muffled>:     Woorse?
Arlene:     Get out of there!

>Jaiq, the god of crappy author created characters that drive My. S.T.ing
>crews bananas:

Charlie:     I kinda like the lesbian speed freak.

>I KNEW IT! MAGICAL FANFIC ELVES *DO* EXIST!! (Chases away all the magical
>fanfic elves.)

Luna:     You see fanfic elves?
Goose<sarcasticaly>:     They tell me to burn things.
Arlene:     I know Jake.

>Tenchi: Now I *AM* all alone! (Just then, Priss from Bubble Gum Crisis,
>Tokyo 2040 jumped out of a plot hole.)

Charlie:     How could something so useful be so dangerous?
Goose:     Like gasoline, or nuclear power, or diet soda. . .

>Priss: Tenchi Masaki, we want you to be the only male on our all-girl
>vigilante squad. Your job will consist of fixing our hardsuits and never
>being in any real danger.

Luna<as Tenchi>:     As opposed to doing all the dirty work?  I'll take
it!

>Tenchi: I thought you already had some one for that.

Goose<as Priss>:     We dehydrated him.
Luna and Charlie:     Never do that again.

>Priss: Yeah, but we killed him because you are sexier than he was!

Arlene:     I guess they did dehydrate him.

>Tenchi: Okay, let's go. (Tenchi and Priss jump though a plot hole and now
>Washu's lab is empty.) Meleni: I know! Let's do an epilogue!

Goose:     Fidel Castro is still in the ballgame in Havana, but the
home field advantage is not what it used to be.
     Jimmy Buffett has finished his book and has gone fishing.
     Where is joe Merchant?
Charlie Fabian:     Yes, where indeed?

>Serra: No, we already did one of those. Let's do the score to the
>basketball game!

Goose and Charlie:     Yeah!  We wanna score!

>[Insert three deities]: Yeah! The basketball game!

Luna<as Cali> Charlie<as Bachus>  & Goose<as Fred Perry>:     Yeah!
The basketball game!

>Jaiq: OKAY! Kiyone's team 96, Ed's team 91!

>THE END

Luna:     I don't get it.

>     And now, A word from the writer... Jaiq: I Drink Three Pots Of Coffee
>A Day! My Brain Doesn't Work, It Only Makes A Humming Noise!  Big Ed Is My

Charlie:     All highly believable.
Goose:     I'd still be doing three pots a day if I had the time.

Jaiq<as Marlon Brando>:     You have permission, and be violent.
Goose:     Thank you.
Charlie:     How does he do that?
Luna:     Scary, isn't it?

All:     HWUH!

Charlie:     Caffeine, sugar, and frequent trips to the bathroom.

Charlie:     Luna, can you get me a cup of coffee?
Luna:     You to, huh?

>and would be all, "Yes Mr.. Treize's ghost, I will kill", but now she's all

>have peace, so, yeah! Plot holes are good!

Arlene:     Wait, you said before that plot holes were bad.
Goose:     Last minute contribution from the plot hole lobby.
Luna:     Any MORE authors notes?
Goose:     No, that's it.

     Back in the reception room Charlie is leaning on the wall next to
the door, Luna is sitting on her desk, Goose is leaning against his,
and Arlene is standing in front of the EMPLOYEES ENYA door with he
hands behind her back.

Goose:     So, what did you think?
Luna:     Fanfic Elves are evil.  But it could've been worse.
Charlie:     Well worth seven or eight minutes.
Arlene:     It's not Jake's fault.
Charlie:     You've been sayin' that all day.  It's getting annoying.
What the Fuck are you talking about?
Arlene:     He said it in the disclaimer.  He has fanfic demons in his
head.  But don't worry Jake, <Pulls her AB-10 from behind her back>
I'll get 'em out for ya.
Goose:     Luna, Charlie, a little help here.  <Goose turns around to
see the door swinging in the breeze>  Great.

     Goose runs outside with bullets flying all around him.  He runs
across the street and jumps and slides across the hood of a car.

Charlie:     Goose!  You made it!
Goose:     Fuck you Fabian.  What are we gonna do about that!
Charlie:      <Sticks his head up to check on Arlene an nearly gets it
shot off>
Luna:      Jake, can you still control the plot holes?
Goose:     Good idea.
Charlie:     I want a second opinion.

     Goose opened a plot hole down the street about half a block, and
out stepped a steam demon.  It spotted Arlene and raised it's rocket-
arm.  There is no Arlene Sanders.

Luna:     Alright!
Charlie:     Great, but how do we get rid of him?
Goose:     Um, haha, uh. . .

Stitch count
Goose=  36
Charlie=  27
Luna=  3
Arlene=  No amount of stitches is gonna fix that!
