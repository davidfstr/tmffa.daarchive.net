Scimitar walked into the theater. *Thank Kami that Urd and Skuld didn't follow me. This is not the day*
Inside he saw his old friend, The Ksawarrior
"Long time no see, Ksa!"
"Same to you my friend"
"Who else is here for this?" the anime investigator asked.
"Ryoga, and Rei. This is gonna be good."
After the introductions, the group went inside.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Scimitar: So whats the fic?
>Ksa: Its called Sammy's Little Secret. Its a lemon. So bad that I called you here to MST it.
>Ryoga: Whats so bad about a fruit? (Gets whacked by both Ksa and Scimitar.)
>Ksa:(changing subject) so how are you, Rei?
>Rei:(no emotion) I am fine.
>Ryoga: she's almost as scary as Azusa.
>Scimitar: You should see what happenned when I fought her as an angel.
>Ksa:(annoyed) hey, no spoilers on your adventures, I want to read it 1st hand.
>Scimitar: Let the fic begin!!

Disclaimer: I didn't create Pretty Sammy or any of the other people AIC and
Pioneer do.  

>Ksa: If I did, they wouldn't be popular at all.

I just write a story based on them and with them in it.  This
story is not meant to offend any one.

>Scimitar: Too late. Kami put this guy on my list of fic writers to kill.
>Ksa:(worried) I'm not on that list, am I?
>Scimitar: Maybe (evil grin)

  So I'm sorry if I make any one mad.
Oh, and please don't sue me.  I'm just a writer.

>Ryoga: I sure Satan has better things to do than help someone sue you.
>Ksa: You have a problem with lawyers, huh?
>Ryoga: Ranma decided to sue me for all the damages I've caused.
>Scimitar: Now THATS alot!

(Note: This is a Lemon, not a Regular or a Crossover.  If you are under 18
you should not read this.)

>Rei: (emotionalless) I am the law.
>Ksa: nah, thats Judge Dredd
>Ryoga: Dear god, she made a joke!
>Scimitar: The 3rd sign of the Apocolypse!

Sammy's Little Secret
=============================

>Ryoga:(singing) C'mon ride the train!
>Others:(singing) Choo! Choo! And ride it!

Rumiya arrives in Sasami's room in bird form then changes.

>Scimitar: Boy he starts as soon as he gets in.
>Ksa: they mean forms, not "from normal to nude"

"Sammy I got your message and I agree.  My sister is out-of-control, and
should be stopped."

>Ryoga: No, me and Ranma are out of control. She is just a second rate magician
>Ksa: But she's better looking than you and Ranma.
>Scimitar: Well maybe not girl-Ranma, but close.
>Rei: ...

Rumiya looks around the room to find a response.  There is none.

>Ksa:(Rumiya) oh look she left me a package.
>Scimitar:(audience member) No its a bomb!
>All:BOOOOOOOOOM!!!

"Sammy please.  I'm not lying, I really do want to help you stop my sister."

>Scimitar: It screams, 'I'm lying'

Sasami steps out of a dark corner.  Dressed in a long black night shirt that
goes down to the knees, with a big carrot picture on the front.

>Scimitar: I don't like where this is going.
>Ksa: I said its a lemon.
>Ryoga:(finally got it) so thats what a lemon is. Wait, they're not gonna..
>Rei: maybe they will.

"Thanks for coming.  I thought for a while you wouldn't come."

>Ksa: Insert sexual jokes here

"Well, I'm here. You said in your letter that you want to talk to me about
leaving my crazy sister and joining you."

>Ryoga:(Rumiya) but I can't because I love Misa

Sasami grinned.  "Yes, thats right.  Ramias out-of-control, her and that
Pixy
Misa that helps her.  I know that you disapprove of her ways.  You helped
stop her and that Dumb computer sales guy from standardizing the world.  And
you did save my life in that giant robot."

>Ryoga: When did that happen?
>Ksa: I take you just watch the TV version
>Ryoga: You mean there's another?
>Scimitar:(sweatdrop) and I used to wonder why he got beat up

Rumiya now with a very red face and a big grin.  "Ya, well.  Its just that I
saw you were in danger and needed my help, as I needed yours."

>Rei: Bullshit. You didn't need their help.
>Ksa: Ok, once more with feelings, Rei

Sasami now glowing red.  "So...So will you join me?"

"Yes, I will join me Sammy."

>Ryoga: did that make sense to you guys?
>Others: Nope

Sasami was so happy that she jumped for joy.  Then she saw that Rumyia was
leaving?

"Wait Rumiya, were are you going?"

Rumiya turned around to look at the confused little girl.  "I'm going to get
my stuff, then find a place to stay.  I'll see you in the morning."

>Scimitar: Rumiya, the eternally lost boy!
>Ryoga:(angry) are you making fun of me?!

Sasami's voice now sounding a little worried.  "No please.  You...You can
stay here if you want!"

>Ksa: we all know where this is going.
>Scimitar: Gag bags?
>Others: Check.

Rumiya stares at Sasami in confusion.  "What, why.  Wouldn't I get in the
way, and where would I stay?  Plus, who knows how long until your family
finds out about me."

>Rei: (Tenchi) Oh hi Sasami, by the way, the boy in your room can't hide to save his life
>Scimitar: Now that was good.

"No worries.  I'll just use my magic powers on them.  It worked with
Ryo-Ohki.  I'll make them think your my cousin or something."

>Ksa: When the HELL was THIS!?!

Rumiya with a look of happiness on his face.  "Ok, thanks Sammy."

"Please call me Sasami.  And I got one more thing for you before you go,
something I've been wanting to give to you ever since the first time I saw
you."

"What's that?"

>Ksa: BRACE YOURSELVES!!

Sasami walks up to Rumiya grads the back of his head and kisses him!"

"UMM!"

Then she lets him go.

>Ryoga: Now its over, the end.
>Others: Yay!

Rumiya still shocked.  "I didn't expect you to use your tongue!"

>Rei: I am surprised she knew how to use her tongue.
>Ksa: How do you know.. never mind

She then tosses Rumiya on her bed.  "Make love to me Rumiya, please!"

>All:....
>Scimitar: Now I know Urd's somewhere in this fic, getting a laugh.

"WHAT.  Are you sure you want, Sasami?"

>Ksa:(Sasami) Actually, no.

"Ever since I met you I've wanted this!"

>Scimitar: which has been 3 tapes, pretty much.

Rumiya then gets off the bed, then lays Sasami down on her back on the bed,
and starts to remove her night shirt.

>Scimitar: He works fast.
>Ksa: Oh god! Ryoga!
(Ryoga is coughing vomit and bleeding from the nose like crazy)
>Scimitar: that is nasty!

"Oh, I can see that you were prepared to have sex with me!"

>All: ...
>Ksa: No commment

Rumiya was right.  Sasami was not wearing a bra or panties, she was
completely naked!

>Ksa: yep, and flat as a wall too.
>Scimitar: I don't even think they have hormones yet.

"I was hoping you would have sex with me, so I came prepared!"

>Ksa: Remember kids, always use a condom.
>Rei: or a sock.
>Others: ...
>Scimitar: Not going to ask.

Rumiya then rushed to remove his cloths, a minute later only his underpants
remand.

>Scimitar: I think we better get Ryoga to a hospital after this fic!
(Ryoga passed out from fluid AND blood loss)

"Wait, I'll take those off for you!"  Sasami said eagerly!

She reached down and slowly pulled off his underpants to show a large and
well shaped penis!

>Scimitar: Viagra works miracles on child pornography.

"Oh, your penis is bigger then I thought it was!"

>Rei: She said casually.
>Ksa: Like she's seen penises before.
>Scimitar: You don't think...
>All: Nah

Rumiya frowned and stared at Sasami's breasts!  They were quite well staked
for a girl her age!  Her nipples were a bright rose color.  He also took a
close look at her pussy!  It looked warm and inviting to Rumiya's eyes!

>All: Bullshit!
>Ksa: I hate lemon writers. I 'll join you on killing this guy.
>Rei: Let me bring my eva and we'll all kill him.

"Well, your pretty hot your self!"

>Scimitar:(Rumiya) Cause my hands are on fire! AIEEE!!
>Ksa: That was lame.

Then Rumiya laid on top of Sasami and inserted his penis into her pussy.

>All:(gagging noises)

"OUCH, OWW!"

>Ksa:(Caesar) Et tu, Rumiya?

Sasami wined in pain for a seconded as Rumiya's penis centered her pussy.

>Rei:(Rumiya) quit whining! Jeez, how am I meant to enjoy this.

Then Rumiya started to move up and down faster,. and faster.  Making the sex
even more intense.

>Scimitar: Now, I'm really gonna kill him!

Rumiya then grabbed Sasamis' left breast and squeezed it gently.

Sasami was also rubbing Rumiya's chest.

Rumiya then started to lick Sasami's breast, then stared to suck on her
breast.

>Ksa: Stop...the...madness!
>Rei:(freaking out) stop the fic!!
>Ksa: this must be bad!
>Scimitar: it got her nutty too!

This went on for five minutes!

>Ksa: The longest five minutes of torture I've ever felt.

Sasami then grabbed Rumiya's balls, as a sign that she was about to climax!

>Ksa: that ball grabbing's gotta hurt.
>Ryoga:(just woke) Oh god, its still on!

So Rumiya move as fast as he could, until they both came!

>Rei: and saw, and conquered.
>Scimitar: Not bad, Rei, not bad at all.

Rumiya then got off sasami and laid next to her in bed.

>Ryoga: which means this is nearly over.
>Others: Yay!

"Hay *PANT* Sasami.  How about *WEZ* I stay in your room!"

>Ksa: if there is a sequel...
>Scimitar: There won't be. When I find him...

"My thoughts *PANT* exactly."

"Hay Sasami, *HOF* you want to do it again!"

>Scimitar: Damn! They got more endurance than me and Ryoga put together.
>Ksa: You do know what that sounds like (gets punched by Ryoga)
>Ryoga: Don't go there!

"Ok.  *WEZ* My first time was great maybe *PANT*  my second time will *HOF*
be even better!"

END.

>All: Hallelujah!!

================================

>Scimitar: and the lemon train leaves again.

I thought it would be interesting to know what would happen if Sasami and
Rumiya got together.  Please be kind with your comments. Tank Cop.

>Scimitar: Ready?
>Others: Lets go!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Later, Tank Cop was killed. People saw an EVA and 3 martial artists at the scene before they 
disappeared.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ksawarrior's thoughts: And I will do it if I find this guy. and if he makes a sequel, it will be
a slow death.
