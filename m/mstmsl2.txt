[6...5...4...3...2...1...Theater]

>-Meanwhile at the Masaki Residence-

(Tenchi makes various exploding sounds. The gang chuckles.)

>"Has anyone seen Mihoshi?" Tenchi asked helping
>Sasami with the lunch dishes.

Lina (Mihoshi's voice echoing faintly.) Heeeeellllp meeeeeee.

>Ryoko and Ayeaka stopped arguing about which
>one of them is going to sit next to Tenchi at dinner and
>looked at each other. Then Ayeaka said,

Lina (Aeka): Mihoshi's seat was right next to Tenchi's. We can BOTH have him!
(A large Anime sweatdrop appears on Tenchi's head.)

>"Mihoshi's been gone for a while." Then she asked, "I wonder where she
>could've gone to?"

Tenchi: Last time I saw her she was leaving with this man that wore a yellow
bandana and carried an umbrella.

>Then Ryoko said, "Good riddance, that's one less
>mouth to feed."

Spencer: Oh, now Ryoko would never say such a thing like that about Mihoshi!
Lina: Smile, then nod, then smile again.

>"You just say that so you can get a bigger serving
>of food. Come to think of it you did have four servings
>of rice while everyone else only had two for themselves,
>"Ayeaka said with a sinister smile, trying to get on to
>Ryoko's nerves.

Lina (Ryoko's nerves): OW! Jeez, Aeka! You weigh a ton!
Tenchi (Aeka): What did you say!?

>Ryoko snapped back with, "What!!! Being next in
>line to be queen of Jurai isn't enough for you, but now
>you have to be the official rice counter too!"

Spencer (Aeka): That's what it says on the badge I'm wearing. "Official rice
counter"! And that bowl over there has over 2,410 grains of rice.
Tenchi: She's RICE VOLUME GUESSING GIRL!

>"What did you say!?. As the first princess of Jurai
>I order you to take that back!!!" Ayeaka snapped back
>yet again.

Lina (Ryoko): BITE ME, LIL' MISS BITCH!
Spencer: Now Lina, there's no need for profanity.

>"Heh. Yeah right, and how's a little girl like you
>going to make me take it back?" Ryoko said in her chair
>putting her hands behind her head and reclining in her
>chair.

Tenchi (Ryoko as Homer Simpson): Mmmm, slanty.

>"Oh yeah!!!. I'll show you just how I'll make you
>take it back!" Ayeaka said standing up over the Space
>Pirate.

Spencer (as a Pirate): Arr! Blood-thirsty Space Pirates are we!!

>"Oh really, go ahead and try!!!" Ryoko said sarcastically
>as she stood up. They stood up into each other's face and
>electricity flew from one to the other.

Lina: That would explain Ryoko's spiky hairstyle.

>Suddenly Washu came in and said,

Lina (Washu): Hey, Tenchi. I need some "assistance" in my lab.
(Tenchi screams.)

>"Mihoshi's in another dimension!!!!!" Then Ayeaka, Ryoko, and Kiyone
>looked at Washu.

Tenchi (Kiyone): And this'll effect me how?

>Suddenly Kiyone jumped up off the couch and said,
>"All Right!!! Mihoshi's net even in this dimension. No
>wonder I've been at peace!!!"

All (singing): Peace on earth, good will to Kiyone....

>"Not so fast Kiyone. You've got to go and save her."
>Washu said drowning Kiyone's hopes

All: *glub glub glublub glub*

>and dreams of a life without her scatter-brained and sometimes >dim-witted
partner Mihoshi.

Tenchi: "Sometimes"?

>"Oh...Uh ...I'd love to help but...Uh...Gee...I've got
>an emergency call. Sorry but I gotta go...Yeah that's it,"
>Kiyone said trying to get out of the rescue operation.
>
>"Sorry Kiyone, but your watch isn't signaling an
>emergency. You're going on the rescue mission." Washu
>told Kiyone.

Lina (Kiyone): Uhhh, it's the one on my belt... the *silent* emergency call!

>"O.K. you caught me there. Well, where is she?"

Spencer (News reporter): Mihoshi was last seen with a hot-tempered  sorceress,
a dim-witted swordsman, and a jumpy little magic user-in-training. If you spot
her, call 1-800-AIR-HEAD. That's 1-800-AIR-HEAD.

>Kiyone sighed as she shrugged her shoulders and rolled
>her eyes to the back of her head as she thought, "Why me?"

Lina (Kiyone): Why not someone else!?

>"I'll show you to the interdimensional chamber but
>first Tenchi, Sasami and Ryo-Oh-ki come here." Washu
>said as she walked to the closet door which lead to her
>laboratory because she redesigned it through sub-space.

All: Uh oh.
Lina: If this becomes a lemon scene, I swear I'm gonna scream.

>Tenchi came out of the kitchen with Sasami and
>Ryo-Oh-ki and said, "Oh wow, Another dimension. I hope
>that she's all right."

Spencer: Remember, that's 1-800-AIR-HEAD.
Tenchi: We get the idea.

>"It's Mihoshi were talking about. With her luck she'll
>be just fine...I hope." Washu told Tenchi as she opened up
>the old closet door and walked on through while she thought
>"She had better be all right or the Galaxy Police will lock me
>up again."

Lina (Washu): Or trap me in a crystal-like meteorite and launch me into space,
depending on which Tenchi universe we're in.

>"It figures. I've gotta save that bubble-head of a
>partner of mine" Kiyone said as she too walked through
>the door.

All: Ouch.
Spencer (Kiyone): Oops, forgot to open the door first.

>"All right! Lets go save Mihoshi!!!" Sasami yelled
>cheerfully with her arms, hands, and fingers outstretched
>as she too walked through the door.

Lina (Sasami): Let's save Mihoshi's ass again!
Tenchi: LINA! Sasami will never say such a thing like that!

>"Miyaaa!" Ryo-oh-ki said from atop Sasami's head.

Spencer: It means "No way! I'm not going down there again!"

>-At Washu's Laboratory-

Lina (Nurse Washu): HELLO!
Tenchi: NO!!
Lina (Nurse Washu): I've got *magic fingers*!
Tenchi: I DON'T CARE!!

>Washu tossed clothes to everyone and
>gave a small red cape to Ryo-Oh-ki and said, "
>Here put these on."

Lina (Washu): I'll just get out the nurse's outfit
(Tenchi screams.)

>"What's with the weird clothes?" asked Sasami
>holding up a pink, blue, white, and brown outfit
>which included a short white and blue skirt,
>pink top, and a brown cloak and sandals.

Spencer: Seems like an alteration to her Pretty Sammy uniform.

>"That's a young girl's outfit for animal
>trainers! Cute huh? You're going to be a animal
>trainer and you, Ryo-Oh-ki will be her partner,"
>Washu explained.
>
>"All right. Isn't that fantastic Ryo-Oh-ki?"
>Sasami asked cheerfully.
>
>"Miyaaa!" Ryo-Oh-ki replied.

Spencer: That means "There's no way that I'm gonna dress up like that and be
abused like a circus animal! Now give me that whip! Let's see how you like
it"!

>Tenchi looked at the armor and sword and
>asked,"Miss Washu, What's with this stuff?"

Lina (to Tenchi): You don't know what a suit of armor and a sword is!?
Tenchi: THAT'S NOT EXACTLY ME!

>"Well Tenchi, I know that you practice sword
>techniques so I thought that you would fit this roll
>perfectly. Tenchi you'll be a
>swordsman protecting Ayeaka from anything that
>may come her way," Washu told Tenchi.
>
>"Um... Excuse me Miss Washu, but protect me.

Tenchi: She want's Washu to protect her instead!?

>What's my part in all of this?" Ayeaka asked wondering
>as she lifted her fine silk and cotton dress.

Spencer: A helpless little damsel-in-distress, duh!

>"Ahh Lady Ayeaka, you will be a best friend to
>Mihoshi. And a lady of high stature with the friends
>who accompany you, as well as a friend to the poor."

Lina: Out of all the options... Little Miss Prissy gets the best one.
Tenchi: Now, now, Lina. There could be some Aeka fans reading this.

>"Uh... little Washu I've only used a bokto,
>(wooden sword).In fact I've never been in a real
>fight or a fight where my life is at danger. I don't
>think I can handle this job," Tenchi told Washu,
>putting the sword and armor down.

(Tenchi jumps up from his seat, looking very offended.)
Tenchi: WHAT!!??
Lina: Whoa, take it easy, Tenchi.
Tenchi: I will not take it easy! I have used a real sword before! And a
magical sword at that! My life Has been endangered many times before! Kagato,
Yakage, the mass, Kain, Yuzuha, I been through it all!
Spencer: Settle down, Tenchi!
Tenchi: I AM THE PRINCE OF JURAI! I CAN CREATE THREE WINGS OF THE LIGHT HAWK!
I AM TENCHI MASAKI! SAME NAME AS THE SWORD! I CAN NOT BE COPIED! I AM
TENCHI!!!
(Tenchi takes a few deep breaths and slumps back in his seat.)
Spencer (Kagato): Good job, Tsunami. You've won, boy... for now.

>Washu looked at Tenchi and then said,
>"Tenchi I have seen you practice. You are more
>than capable for this job."

Tenchi: DAMN STRAIGHT!!!

>"Ryoko, you'll be a mercenary hired to protect
>Lady Aeka on her journey," Washu said plainly.
>
>"From space pirate to mercenary. Pretty much
>the same thing don't you think, Ryoko?" Ayeaka said
>out loud and on purpose just to get on Ryoko's nerves.

Spencer: Let's see here. A mercenary hunts down people for money, Space
Pirates pillage and loot without mercy... Nope, not exactly the same thing.

>"Ah! Shut up!!!" Ryoko Replied in a nasty tone
>turning away from Ayeaka.
>
>"Uh ... Miss Washu, what's my part in all of this?"
>Kiyone asked wondering.

Lina: Same here. Victim to our many exploits.

>"Heh heh, Kiyone you will be a a serving girl to Lady
>Ayeaka," Washu said, laughing under her breath.
>
>"WHAT!!!!!!!! NO WAY!!!! I REFUSE !!!!!!!" Kiyone
>yelled in defiance.

Spencer: Well, she's a police. And police are servants to the community.

>"Ohhh! Why not? Someone needs that job and all
>the other slots are filled," Washu responded, handing a
>somewhat worn dress to Kiyone.
>
>"Okay... Mihoshi, You'd better appreciate this!"
>Kiyone said reluctantly.

Lina (Mihoshi): Don't worry,I will!

>"All right, while everyone is changing I'll explain a
>bit of what I know about this dimension. First, there is
>magic. So Ryoko and Ayeaka don't be afraid to use your
>power.

Spencer: What power do they share?
Lina: The power to argue with each other like their's no tomorrow?

>Second, there are monsters like trolls, Dragons,
>and Minotaurs,

Lina (Dorthy): Dragons and Minotaurs and Trolls!
All: Oh my!

>so be careful. And lastly, be careful of enchanted weapons. Tenchi >your
sword is enchanted.

Tenchi: You betcha!

>The enchantment is the spell Fire Sword. Yell
>'Fire! Attack' at your opponent, and you'll see a fire ball launch
>from the sword,"

Tenchi: Waitaminute! My sword doesn't do that!
Spencer: Exactly which Tenchi Universe is this really?

>Washu explained to everyone. "Okay, everyone ready, get on the
>interdemensional chamber platform. Oh! Tenchi here is a device that >will let
me bring you back when you have found Mihoshi, Okay, I'm >hitting the
transwarp switch,"

Lina: Watch in suspense as she HITS the TRANSWARP SWITCH!

>Washu hit the button then glittery blue swirls surround the group,

Tenchi (Stoned Junkie): The colors, dude... THE COLORS, MAN!

>then they disappeared.
>More to come soon.

All: NOT WHILE WE'RE HERE! (The trio bolts out of the theater.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[1...2...3...4...5...6...Bridge]

(Spencer finds himself alone on the bridge, again. This time a girl donned in
a two-toned jumpsuit appears and floats around Spencer playfully.)

Spencer: You are...?
Goddess of Crossovers: The Goddess of Crossovers, silly.
Spencer: Well before you ask. My answer is no, I'm not gonna come over to the
cross-over side. I've already got people from two anime shows livin' with me.
Goddess of Crossovers: But how about we both can create sumpthin' wild and
different!
Spencer: Like what?
Goddess of Crossovers: Well, umm... how about a.... SLAYERS/EVANGELION
Crossover!
Spencer: Nope.
Goddess of Crossovers: A Sailor Moon/Dominion crossover?
Spencer: No.
Goddess of Crossovers: A Seinfeld/Tenchi Muyo crossover?
Spencer: Ick. No way!
Goddess of Crossovers: Simpsons/DragonBall!
Spencer: Begone, foul demon!
Goddess of Crossovers: Hey! I'm no demon, I'm a Goddess!
Spencer: I said BEGONE! LEAVE MY EYESIGHT AT ONCE!
(The God of Self-Insertion appears next to the Goddess.)

God of Self-Insertion: You will join the crappy fanfic side!
Spencer: Never!

(Another guy wearing shorts and a T-shirt with lemons all over them appears
next to the two other Gods.)

Spencer: Don't tell me... the God of Lemons.
God of Lemons: Dang straight! Join us, it's your destiny!
Spencer: No! NO!!!!!

(The Three Gods grab Spencer and start shaking him. They are then replaced by
Tenchi, Lina, and Kamidake. Spencer was dreaming... again.)

Lina: You certanly picked up a habit for falling asleep at the helm.
Spencer: So there was no Goddess of Crossovers? No God of Lemons or God of
Self-Insertion?
Lina: What?
Tenchi (Cartman): Spencer, you gotta lay off the cough syrup. I'm worried
about you, man.
Spencer: B-but I felt their presence... they're trying to pull me into the
crappy fanfic side!
(Spencer gets up and looks outside the veiwscreen, three stars lined up
together glitter menacingly at him. He stares at them, like in a trance.
Making Tenchi and Lina feel rather uneasy.)

Lina: Uhhh... I think I'll hit the hay now, G'night
Tenchi: Yeah.... me too.
(But Spencer stays. Looking at the stars, and the stars looking back. After
hours of staring, Spencer finally realizes that it's just Orion's belt he's
staring at. And retires to his room for some much-needed shut-eye.)

[But in another world...]

(Three figures shadowed in the darkness observe the resting body of Spencer.
They mutter something to each other, then laugh evily.)

Stinger: "Uh... little Washu I've only used a bokto, (wooden sword). In fact
I've never been in a real fight or a fight where my life is at danger. I don't
think I can handle this job," Tenchi told Washu, putting the sword and armor
down.
