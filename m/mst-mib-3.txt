Hello again everybody! Rick "The Mirror Knight" Everts again, here with the 
third and final part of Tenchi Muyo! Versus Men in Black...MSTified!  I think 
the writers got tired of trying to bang down by door and went home, so I should 
be ok. Time for the standard legal mumbo jumbo:

you think I was pathetic.

Back on the SOL, Mike and the bots' ponder what they will do with their small 
break. Gypsy's voice suddenly intrerupts them via intercom.

Gypsy: Mike! Scanners picking up a spacecruiser at 9 o'clock!
Mike: Go to Rocket camera #9!

Cut to outside SOL to see a spaceship made of what seems to be a reflective 
mirror surface.

Cut back to inside SOL
Gypsy: We're getting a video transmission from the ship!
Mike: OK. Put it on the Hex field view screen.
Gypsy: Rodger!
The Hex field view screen opens up to reveal a man with black hair in armor that 
matches the ships hull.
Man: I AM THE MIRROR KNIGHT!!!
Mike: Uh, hello Mr. Mirror Knight. Can I help you?
Mirror Knight: How dare you make fun of writer-based characters used in 
crossovers!!
Mike: What do you mean?
Mirror Knight: I am a writer-based character! You have better have a good excuse 
of why you have made fun of me and my friends!
Mike: Well, it's just that most writers spend way to much time on explaining 
their characters powers, and takes away from the story.
Mirror Knight: WhaT?!?! ...well I guess you have a point. Still if the fic is 
written well, it shouldn't matter.
Crow: Well, this fic is NOT WRITTEN WELL!
Mirror Knight: Yeah, that's true... hey...what are you doing?
(Mike looked into the Mirror Knight's armor and sees his hair is messed up, and 
is trying to fix it.)
Mike:Uhhmmm...
Mirror Knight: YOU ARE USING MY ARMOR AS A MIRROR?!?! YOU WILL DIE FOR THIS LACK 
OF RESPECT!!!
Gypsy: Weapons on Mirror ship charging!!
Tom: Nice one, Tom!
Gypsy: Another ship coming in!

Cut to Rocket Camera #9

We see a ship that appears to be Ryo-Ohki shooting at the Mirror spaceship.

Cut to inside SOL

Mirror Knight: Aghhh! (Hex field view screen closes and Mirror ship flys away)

Crow: Hey! Is that...?

Gypsy: We are getting an audio transmission from the Ryo-Ohki!

Mike: Put it through!

Tenchi's Voice: Hey guys! You ok?

Tom: Wow! Is it really you?

Tenchi's voice: Yeah. Hey, if guys are all right, we have to chase that guy 
before he has a guy named Rick Everts make a crossover fic with him in it!

Mike: Uh, ok. See you.

Cut to RC#9

We see Ryo-ohki fly away

Back to inside SOL

Crow: Wow, that was cool!

Tom: Yeah, its not everyday you get attacked by a made up person, and be saved 
by anime characters!

Alarms and lights go off

Mike: Crossover fan fic sign!!!

Mike in bots run in different directions.

Act 6

Scene 1

{In the medical room Ryoko and Mitsuki lie in separate beds.  Tenchi sits in a 
chair next to
Ryoko's bed with Ryo-Ohki on his shoulder.}

Tenchi: {Regretfully.} Ryoko...If only I wasn't asleep...
[Tom: I would of got my butt kicked.]

Ryoko: {Waking up.} Ooohhh...

Tenchi: {Surprised.}  Ryoko!

{Ryo-Ohki meows happily.}

[Crow: Actually, it's more of a Rhi-ow.]
Ryoko: Tenchi.  You stayed with me?

Tenchi: Yes.  Are you alright?

Ryoko: {Sitting up.} Yeah, I just tired myself out.

{The door opens, and J and L walk in.}

Tenchi: J, L, what's happening?

L: {Gravely.} Ryoko, we hereby place you under arrest.

J: {Seriously.} Please don't give us any trouble.

Ryoko & Tenchi: WHAT?!

{Ryo-Ohki meows questioningly.}

Ryoko: {Angry.} After all we did together last night, you'd still arrest me?

J: {Pulls out a set of handcuffs.}
[Mike: Not a word, little boy.]
[Crow: What?!]
We have no choice.  Zed ordered this.

Ryoko: {Flies to the ceiling and prepares to attack.} With Illirg senseless, I 
can attack you now, you know!
[Crow: I think the writer was senseless, for writing this fic.]
Tenchi: {Moving before J and L.  Pleading.} Ryoko don't.  We all knew this might 
happen.

Ryoko: {Lands before Tenchi.  Tears in her eyes.} Yes, but I won't leave you 
again!
[Tom: You still owe me five dollars!] 
Tenchi: {Turns to J and L.} Is there any other way?

L: No.

Ryoko: {Placing her hands in position.} Alright.  I'll go.

J:  {Places the cuffs on Ryoko's wrists.} I'm sorry.

Tenchi: I'm going with you to see Zed.

Ryoko: {Pleading.} Tenchi, no!

Tenchi: Ryoko, I'm going with you.

{Together, J, L, Ryoko, and Tenchi with Ryo-Ohki walk to Zed's office where he 
sits behind his
desk waiting for them.  Ryo-Ohki hisses at Zed.}

Zed: Ah, Ryoko.  You have finally surrendered.

Ryoko: Yes.

Tenchi: Zed, why have you arrested Ryoko after all she's done for the universe?

J & L: Yeah?

Zed: Because the warrants for Ryoko have not been canceled.

J: Why not?

Zed: Because the Galaxy Police Headquarters was destroyed by Kain so no one 
could change any records.  But, I can.

Ryoko, Tenchi, J, and L: {Surprised.} What???

Zed: As of today, the space pirate Ryoko is just plain civilian Ryoko.

L: {Confused.} You're absolving Ryoko of all her past crimes?

Zed: Yes.  As Tenchi said, she has done so much for the universe, however 
unorthodox.

{Ryo-Ohki meows in joy.}

J & L: {Jumping for joy.} Yeah!

{Ryo-Ohki jumps down, phases through the walls, does flips, and meows in 
happiness.} 
[Mike and bots act like they are trying to dodge Ryo-Ohki]
[Mike: Geez!]
[Crow: Watch where you are going, ya little furball!]

Ryoko: {Breaks the cuffs.  Ecstatically hugs Tenchi.}
[Tom: Accidentally braking his back, making him paralyzed from the neck down, 
the end!]
Oh, Tenchi!  I'm FREE!!!

Tenchi: {Happy.} This is great, {Thinking.} but what about Illirg?

{The cheering stops.  Ryo-Ohki returns to Tenchi's shoulder.}

Zed: Yes.  We have to defeat him.  Other agents have released to the press that 
Illirg was a holographic experiment by Reed Richards,
[Mike: Apparently the MiB makes all their press releases in Hero magazine.]  
and the injured super-heroes are healing.

J: Have you kept tabs to Illirg?
[Tom: Yeah, he still owes us for seven beers and a Maui.]
Zed: Yes.  He went to the fields outside town and hasn't moved.  He may be 
healing himself.

L: As an insect he probably can regenerate himself.

Tenchi: Couldn't he be regrowing his antennae?

L: I doubt it.  He'd probably concentrate on his arm so he can attack at full 
strength.

Zed: Why don't y'all to Washu's lab and prepare for the coming fight.
[Crow: Why don't we all do what to Washu's lab?]
J & L: Yes, sir.

Ryoko: {Her arm around Tenchi.}  Just leave it to us, Zed.

Tenchi: Oh, Ryoko.

{J, L, Ryoko, and Tenchi with Ryo-Ohki exit Zed's office and walk down the hall 
to the medical room and into Washu's lab, cheering the whole way.  Within 
Washu's lab Washu continues the work on the Lyex which is nearly rebuilt. Near 
her feet sits seemingly a two pipe intersection joint with its ends covered with 
lenses.  Kiyone is in the cockpit learning the controls.  Ayeka stands watching 
Washu.}

Ryoko: {Happy.} Kiyone!

Kiyone: {Startled.} Ryoko?  What is it?

Ryoko: You can't chase me anymore!  I'm acquitted!

{Ryo-Ohki meows happily.}

Ayeka: {Surprised.} WHAT?!

Kiyone: {Surprised.} You're kidding! {Climbs down.} Who did this?

L: Zed did.

Ayeka: You?!  The worst criminal in the entire galaxy?!  Acquitted?!

Ryoko: Get over it, Ayeka.

Ayeka: {Angering.} No, I shall not!  You should be punished for you crimes!

Ryoko: Who's going to do that?  You?

Tenchi: {Runs between them.} Girls!  Please stop!
[Tom: Oh, oh! Bad move Tenchi!]
Ayeka: No, I will not! {Her cylinders appear.}

{Ryo-Ohki meows in fear and jumps to Washu's shoulder.}

J: {Scared.} Time to bail!

Ryoko: {Charging.} Come and get it, princess!

Washu: {Grabbing the pipe device.  Calmly.} Follow me to the kitchen where 
Sasami and Mihoshi are fixing breakfast.

{Washu, Kiyone, J, L, and Ryo-Ohki enter the door to the kitchen.}

Tenchi: {Pleading.} No!  Stop!
[Mike: I wonder what will happen to Tenchi?]
[Crow: Probably going to suffer from a few burns.]
[Tom: A few?]

{Ryoko flies up and fires onto Ayeka who blocks.  Wipe to the kitchen. 
[Tom: With new Windex Glass and Surface cleaner!]
In the background the battle in the other room rages with screaming, yelling, 
and explosions.  Here, Sasami stands over a pot of cooking soup.  A table stands 
with Mihoshi sitting waiting for food.
[Tom: As usual.]
[Crow: If she's not sleeping.]
[Mike: Or getting into accidents.]
Washu, Kiyone, J, and L sit around the table.  Washu sets the pipe device on the 
table.  Ryo-Ohki jumps onto Sasami's head.}

Sasami: {Happy.} Hi, Ryo-Ohki.  Hi, everyone.  Soup's ready. {Picks up the pot 
and places it on the table.  Sits at the table.} Eat up!

Mihoshi: Oh, yum!

{One large explosion is heard, and the battle sounds stop.  Tenchi, Ayeka, and 
Ryoko enter and sit at the table singed.}
[Tom: Hello.]
[Mike: Hello.]
[Crow: Hello.]
[All: Hello!]
Kiyone: Get your frustrations out?

{Ayeka and Ryoko scowl at Kiyone.}

Washu: Now that you two've finished, I'd like to explain this. {Pats the pipe 
device.}

L: What is that?
[Crow: Man, you're dumb! Don'tcha know a bong when ya see one?] 

Washu: It's an Energy-Combining Beam Spreader.  Ayeka, Ryoko, you two fire at 
full strength into these to ports...{Points to the closest two lenses.} here and 
here.  Your energies will be combined and spread out this port here. {Points to 
the larger end.} With this you should be able to eliminate Illirg's shields and 
weaken his attacks.

J: Would be nice.

Washu: Also, J and Kiyone can pilot the Lyex in the battle with Tenchi.

Mihoshi: What about us?
[Tom: What about you? You just eat, sleep, and crash!]

Washu: We'll fly in Yagami watching for the creator of Illirg, Nerti.

Ayeka: Nerti?

[Crow: It's Nerti, or nothing!]


Washu: Yes.  The chemical structure of the fifth chemical in Illirg's blood 
matched that used by a scientist I heard about while I was reinstated with the 
Science Academy. She's from one of the many galaxies that fear the thought 
processes of Earth.
[Mike: Oh no!]
[Tom: Our prayers have been rejected...it IS a writer-made character crossover!]
[Crow: Well, back to doing it my way! I just ask Scratch to come back over, 
and...]
[Mike: I don't think so! It took me forever to get Tom's soul out of that 
Toaster Strudel and back into his body!]

Kiyone: I remember that name was involved in scattered thefts at museums and 
terrorist bombings lately.

Washu: The same.

Ryoko: We could beat her.

Washu: Maybe, but she has a good deal of technology on her side.  We also have 
to look out for her nemesis, some guy in red battle armor.

Sasami: Who's he?

Washu: I don't know.

[Tom: Good. Keep it that way.]

Kiyone: I've heard of him and also know that he's never been accused of any 
crime.  He always seems to be watching from a distance.
[Crow: Yeah, he only likes to watch.]
Ryoko: Oh well.  Time to eat.

{They all begin to eat.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{Montage.  Door to Washu's lab opens.  J and Kiyone's shadows can be seen.  Wipe 
to the spaceship hangar.  Washu, Sasami, Mihoshi, L and Ryo-Ohki board Yagami.  
Wipe to the MIB motor-pool. Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko with the modified beam 
spreader stand next to a MIB car.  Each create their individual battle suit.  
Back to Yagami.  The bay doors open.  Yagami flies out the opening.  Back to the 
Lyex hangar.  The door above it opens.  The thrusters ignite and propel it out.  
In the MIB motor-pool Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko's car roars to life and changes 
for subsonic travel.  The sliding door opens.  The black car spins out and takes 
the road.  End montage.}

{The MIB car tears up the road.  The Lyex flies above it to the left.  Yagami 
flies above the car to the right. Onboard Yagami Mihoshi and Washu sit in the 
pilots' seats.  L and Sasami with Ryo-Ohki stand behind Mihoshi and Washu.}

Washu: {Pressing a key before her to open a com line.} We all understand the 
plan?  Ryoko and Ayeka weaken Illirg's attacks while J, Kiyone, and Tenchi make 
the frontal assault to destroy it.

Kiyone: {Her face comes onto the screen before Washu.} Check.

Ryoko: {Her face comes onto the screen next to Kiyone's.} Right, though I wish I 
could fight him again.

Ayeka: {Next to Ryoko.} I would like that, Ryoko.  Go ahead and take on Illirg 
again.

Tenchi: {From the back seat.} Please don't!  We must do this together.

Ryoko: {Frustrated.} Alright.

Ayeka: {Agreeing.} Yes.

J: {Next to Kiyone.} Are you sure we can beat him?

Washu: Yes.  Tenchi and the Lyex should be able to destroy Illirg.

Kiyone: Good luck watching for Nerti.

L: We'll need it.

Mihoshi: {Scared.} AAAHHH!!!  I SEE IT!!!

Everyone else: WHERE?!

[Crow: (as Mihoshi) Ooops! It's just a regular mantis...I had magnification on.]
[Mike and Tom: MIHOSHI!!]

{Mihoshi points dead ahead.  Ahead of the formation, Illirg stands ready for 
them.}

Washu: Battle stations!

{The MIB car stops.  Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko pile out.  Ayyeka and Ryoko set up 
the beam spreader while Tenchi pulls out the Tenchiken.  Yagami peals off and 
begins a search pattern. The Lyex lands
[Crow: On top of the car.]
next to the MIB car.
[Tom: Bad call, Crow!]
[Crow: Bahh.]
Illirg comes before them.  His arms are identical in
destructive power again.  The sun lowers in the distance.}

Illirg: You believe that since I cannot sense you anymore, I am susceptible to 
your puny attacks?  You couldn't defeat me twice!  Do you truly trust in the 
"third time's the
charm" philosophy?
[Mike: Uh, that's what the plan was.]
J & Ryoko: Shut up and FIGHT!

{Ryoko fires a large powerful stream of energy into the beam spreader.  Ayeka's 
tiara glows
green.  She fires and equally powerful stream into the other port.  The 
resulting white light
shines across Illirg.  He attempts to activate his under-leg jets.  Tenchi forms 
a blade and
quickly slices the exit ports, hence no control. 
[Mike: Thanks for clearing that up, writer.]
[Crow: Yep! The one time something is fairly obvious, he explains it. When we 
don't know what the hell's going on, he just rambles on!]
Illirg flies up, flips, and falls clumsily to the ground again.
[Mike: Oh, he's going to lose a lot of points on his dismount!]
He stands again.  Seeing the result of Tenchi's attack, the Lyex immediately 
starts to unload on the beast: laser weapons, energy projectiles, machine gun 
fire, everything. [Tom: Including the Spam cannon.]
Illirg power changes to Kain temporting all the weapons away.  Tenchi comes up 
and absorbs some of the Kain energy into the Tenchiken.
[Crow: BUUURRRP!]
Illirg quickly changes to Ryoko firing rapid fire blasts on Tenchi who blocks 
them.  The Lyex engages the saw blade on the left arm cutting off two legs on 
the left side.}
[Tom: Of course, that didn't really happen, because ALL OF THE WEAPONS WERE 
TEMPORTED AWAY!!]
[Crow: Temported?]
[Tom: That's what the writer said what happened to them!]

J: {Sarcastically.} Not the big, bad bug anymore, are we?

{The beam spreader starts to turn red.}

Ayeka: {Worried.} Tenchi!  Hurry!

Ryoko: {Worried.} This thing's starting to melt!

Illirg: {Mad with anger.} DAMN!  Try this! {Begins to summon immense power.}

{Tenchi and the Lyex back off.  Illirg's coloring change on one side to resemble 
Kain, on the
other Kagato.  Suddenly, an energy blast breaks through the center of the 
creature.  He falls split into two quivering masses.  Ryoko and Ayeka stop their 
energy and walk to positions around Tenchi.  The beam spreader is ruined.  
Tenchi deactivates the Tenchiken blade.}

Ayeka: He destroyed himself.

Ryoko: {Avenged.} He deserved it.

[Mike: He learned too late that power only...]
[Crow: Don't get all speechy, Mike.]
[Mike: Sorry.]

{Suddenly, the masses metamorphose into solid obsidian copies of Kain and 
Kagato.}

Black Kain & Black Kagato: MASTER, AVENGE ME!!! {Make to attack.}

{Tenchi reforms the blade and cleaves the Kain replica into nothingness.  The 
Lyex comes and steps on the Kagato wannabe.  The remains of Illirg are no more.}

Tenchi: That should be the end of Kagato and Kain, forever.

Kiyone: {Over the Lyex's PA.} What about Nerti?  She still has the genetic 
information that created Illirg.

Ayeka: Yes.  Where is she?

[Tom: And more importantly, who cares?]
Washu: {Over the Lyex's PA from Yagami.} Here's your answer!

{Above them all a fighter ship flies in from the sky.  Yagami maneuvers after 
Nerti's ship.  It fires several weapons onto the ship doing, from Mihoshi's 
skill, very little damage.  Nerti's ship turns around and energizes its shields.  
She moves to ramming speed flying through Yagami
splitting it in half.  From the front half of Yagami, Ryo-Ohki ship flies out 
with all four other characters onboard.  Yagami hits the ground 100 meters from 
the others.  Ryo-Ohki begins to attack.}

Ryoko: {Angry.} I'll get her! {Flies up and fires upon Nerti's ship.}

J: Come on, Kiyone!  Let's get her!

Kiyone: Roger!

{The Lyex flies up and begins to unload on Nerti's ship.  From this ship a human 
figure in shot out at the Lyex.  The figure goes through the center of the robot 
destroying the power cell.  The figure lands near Tenchi and Ayeka.  The Lyex 
falls toward the land.  Ryo-Ohki meows, quickly
flies down, and teleports J and Kiyone off the wreckage.  Ryo-Ohki pulls up 
hard.  The Lyex crashes destroying itself and the MIB car it fell on. 
[Tom: Hey Crow! It happened after all!]
[Crow: Told ya!] 
Ryoko is fired upon by Nerti's ship.  She
blocks but is moved backward enough to touch Ryo-Ohki.  She teleports into Ryo-
Ohki and takes
control.}

Ryoko: This ship is a pain.  Washu, do you have any plan to fight this thing?

Washu: No one's ever encountered Nerti, at least that we know of.

Mihoshi, L, & Sasami: Look out!

Ryoko: WHOA! {Steers Ryo-Ohki out of the line of fire.}

{On the ground.}

Tenchi: Their weapons haven't worked.  Would we have any more effect?

Ayeka: I do not know.

Voice: Yes, you would.

{From a crater the human figure stands battered.  He wears a red armor vest, 
blue metal pants,
[Mike: Oh! He got a pair of Levi's Hard Jeans!]
and a white cap.  His face bears battle-marks.  His eyes are covered with a 
black visor.  His arms bear control gauntlets for the weapons in the pack on his 
back.}

Ayeka: Who are you?

Human: I am Evil Pii, dear lady. {Bowing.} If you two attack that location on 
the side, it shall be destroyed. {Pointing at the engines of the ship.}

Tenchi: How do you know this?

Evil Pii: {Regretfully.} I knew the designer and pilot at one time, but she has 
changed much. Just destroy it.

Ayeka: Please explain.

Evil Pii: Just fire!

[Tom: I don't know about you, but if a guy address himself as EVIL Pii, do you 
think you would trust him?]
{Tenchi faces a palm.  Ayeka faces both.  Ayeka's crown glows green.  The two 
fire fireballs at
the ship's engines.  It is destroyed.  Ayeka and Tenchi turn to Evil Pii.  He 
immediately presses
a key on his left gauntlet.  His backpack gains wings.  Rockets fire.  Evil Pii 
flies up into the
smoke of the explosion.  Attacks are heard.  Evil Pii smashes a female figure to 
the ground.  She
throws him off, jumps on him, and picks him up by the collar.  She has golden 
hair and a silver
body.}

Female: Pii, now you die!
[Tom: All while reciting poetry!]

Evil Pii: {Looking deep into her steel eyes.} You are no more than a metallic 
facsimile.  You shall be punished for the exile of your creator.

Nerti: But not by you.

{A dimensional gateway opens behind Evil Pii.  Nerti throws him into it.  The 
gate closes.}

Tenchi: {Brandishing the Tenchiken.} So you're Nerti.

Nerti: Yes.  And, you are the son a Juraian and a human.  Your fate will be much 
worse than Evil Pii's. {Pulls out a bronze handle which expands to a full 
scythe.}

{Tenchi and Nerti clash weapons.  Ayeka creates her cylinders, but as Nerti 
fights Tenchi with
one hand, she fires a energy weapon on her other arm at Ayeka who barely is able 
to block the
blast.  Nerti and Tenchi come to a fight of strength with Tenchi pushing up with 
the Tenchiken
and Nerti pushing down on the scythe.  Ryo-Ohki meows.  She pulls over them and 
teleports up Ayeka and Tenchi.  Nerti continues to push the scythe down into the 
ground causing a small tremor.  Nerti nonchalantly heads to the wreckage of her 
ship and begins to salvage it.  Ryo-Ohki speeds away.  Onboard.}

Washu: {Impressed.} So that was Nerti and Evil Pii.

J: {Wiping his forehead.} Nerti's a tough bitch.
[Mike: ...and Evil Pii is a little wuss.]

Ayeka: {Sitting down from weariness.} Evil Pii said something about that Nerti 
not being the true Nerti.

Washu: {Remembering.} Yes.  Nerti was a humanoid, not a mechanoid.  

L: {Dumbfounded.} So powerful...

Ryoko: {Frustrated.} Great!  Destroy one villain for another!
[Crow: This deal not valid in New Mexico, Nevada, Jupiter, or any planets in the 
Delta system.]

Sasami: What are we to do?

Kiyone: {Grimly.} Prepare for Nerti.

Tenchi: {Grimly.} I doubt we'll have to wait long.

Mihoshi: {Scared.} AAAHHH!!!  I don't want to DIE!!!

J: {Sarcastically.} Can I throw Mihoshi out?

Ryoko: {Sarcastically.} No, that'd be too messy.

[Tom: But as for killing her, go ahead!]
[Crow: Yes! Do it! Do it!]
L: Why hasn't Nerti followed us?
[Crow: Bahhh!]
Washu: Probably finding weapons in the wreckage of her ship.

Kiyone: {Sad.} My ship was destroyed!  

Sasami: {Optimistic.} Washu can fix it, Kiyone.

{Kiyone looks nicely to Sasami.}

L: {Tired.} Today's been a long day.

Tenchi: {Worried.} Tomorrow's going to be worse.

{Ryo-Ohki flies into the sunset.}

End Scene 2

End Act 6

Act 7

Scene 1

{In Zed's office Zed sits behind his desk looking at reports as Tenchi, Ayeka, 
Ryoko, Sasami
with Ryo-Ohki, Washu, Kiyone, Mihoshi, J, and L walk in.  Tenchi, Ayeka, and 
Ryoko still wear
the battle suits.}

Zed: {Looks up.}
[Tom: Take your suits off and stay awhile!]
Well, how'd it go?

J: Not good.

L: Illirg is dead, but Nerti is in his place.

Tenchi: All of us couldn't beat her.

Ayeka: We need help.

Zed: I doubt the entire MIB would be enough to destroy her.

Washu: Not with the weaponry we have right now, and the Lyex is damaged beyond 
repair.

Kiyone: And, Yagami is in desperate need of work.

Ryoko: We did destroy her ship though.

{Explosion is heard in the background.  Alarms blare.}

Zed: {Turns to a monitor.} What's this?

Washu: {Seeing a gold and silver flash on the screen.} It's Nerti!

Kiyone: The way she's going, she'll run right through here!

{The door is broken down to find Nerti standing in the doorway with a laser 
rifle in her left hand, her scythe in her right, and a Gatling gun attached to 
her left shoulder.}

Nerti: Finally.  I've found you Zed.  Now, I shall accomplish what my creation 
could not, your death.

Zed: Kill me?!  Why?
[Mike: (as Zed) It's not like I wanted to be in this fan fic!]
Nerti: To destroy Earth's main link to the stars thereby making it defenseless.

Tenchi: {Readying the Tenchiken.} Earth isn't defenseless yet!
[Crow: (as Nerti) Hah! YOU?!! Hahahahahahahah...ugh!]
[Tom: Nerti dies laughing, THE END!]

Ayeka: {Cylinders appear around her.} The Earth is our home too now!  You shall 
not take it away!

Ryoko: {Forming an energy sword.} This time you're dead, Nerti!

{Kiyone, Mihoshi, J, and L pull their weapons.  All prepare of battle.  
Suddenly, a temporal gate opens to the left of Nerti.  Through it, Spiderman 
swings into Nerti knocking her down.}
[Tom: BUT...HE...BOOOOOOM! (Head explodes)]
[Mike: Not again!]

Ryoko: Let's get out of here! {Cuts a hole in the glass wall.}
[Crow: Using her Acme Little Sharp Gem glass cutter]

{Nerti stands and throws Spidey away.  Tenchi follows suit 
[Mike: ...and throws himself away.]
and slices another hole.  Nerti begins firing the rifle on Tenchi and the 
Gatling gun on Ryoko.  Ayeka places a shield about the group saving all from 
injury.  Washu and Sasami with Ryo-Ohki jump through Tenchi's hole. Mihoshi, L, 
and Zed jump through Ryoko's hole.}

Nerti: {Stops firing.} You will never escape! {Gestures to both groups of 
refugees.}

{Washu, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Mihoshi, L, and Zed are placed in confinement fields 
and are flown up to flank their captor.  Ayeka lifts her shield.  Tenchi and 
Ryoko run and swipe at the fields doing no damage.  Nerti takes her scythe and 
knocks them back to the others.  Ayeka hits her with a field attack.  Nerti 
grabs her chest for a moment.  Kiyone and J fire their weapons at Nerti where 
upon impact the blasts ricochet off.}

J: This ain't workin'.  What about this? 
[Crow: Oh, great, he's gonna start dancing isn't he?]
[Tom: (Head regrows with a loud pop) Getting' Jiggy with it!]
[Mike: We gotta start looking into a better stress buffer for you, my friend.]
{Angles his weapon to Nerti's Gatling gun.}

{Nerti's Gatling gun is destroyed knocking her down.  Kiyone destroys the rifle 
throwing Nerti to
one side.}

Zed: Leave!

Washu: You guys must escape!

Tenchi: We won't leave you!

Ayeka & Ryoko: Yeah!

{Nerti stands.  Tenchi  fires on Nerti's scythe hand blowing it off.}

Nerti: Nice move. {Metal tendrils come from her broken arm and quickly reattach 
the severed forearm.} Unfortunately, useless.

{Ryoko throws her sword into Nerti's chest.  Her chest is blown open to reveal 
her power systems surrounded by an uninterrupted force field.  Quickly, tendrils 
cover the opening and morph to match her original coating.}
[Crow: Those tendrils are really saving her hash!]

Nerti: This is fun, but I have worlds to destroy. {Aims her scythe at the group 
with a halo of energy on the tip.}

L: {Pleading.} Please go!

J: We'll come back for you!

Ryoko: Just hold on! {Creates a portal.}

{Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, J, and Kiyone run through said portal into the medical 
room.  The warp
closes.}

Ryoko: {Frustrated.} Dammit!  She's too powerful!

Kiyone: {Optimistic.} But, we all did damage though.

J: {Frustrated.} But, she's still alive!

Ayeka: {Sad.}  And, we must save the others.

Tenchi: We will, Ayeka.

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{At GPHQ, Mitsuki walks down a hall.  Suddenly, alarms go off.  People crowd 
into the corridors running from a temporal wave.}

Mitsuki: {Recognizing this scene.}
[Tom: (As Mitsuki) NO! Not another flashback!] No...Kain...Again...A!

{Mitsuki runs down the corridor to Operative A's room.  Within the room 
Operative A is being
absorbed into the wave.}

[Tom: Bounty Temporal Waves, the quicker picker upper!]

Operative A: AAAHHH!!!

Mitsuki: NNNOOO!!! {Runs and tries to save him.}

{When Mitsuki touches Operative A, she passes through him.}

Mitsuki: What?!

{The wave overtakes the two of them.  White screen.  Operative A stands on the 
observation deck
of the Tokyo Tower waiting for Kain.  Mitsuki stands near the elevator.}

Mitsuki: Where...? {Looks out the window and sees the white streak of Kain.} 
NO...NO! {Runs to Operative A.  Pleading.} A, please!  Let's leave!

{An explosion rocks the entire tower.  Operative A looks out the glass and aims 
at his Gatling gun.}

Mitsuki: {Crying.} A, please!  I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU AGAIN!!!

{Operative A fires at Kain.  No effect.  Kain teleports out of sight.}

Operative A: {Searching for Kain.} Wha...Where'd he go?

[Mike: Uh, how does she know exactly what he said if she wasn't there?]
[Crow: Um...]
[Tom: It was in Kiyone's report!]
[Mike: They must've used her report as the script when they made TiL!"

{Kain shatters through the glass.}

Operative A: AAAHHH!!!

{Operative A fires at Kain.  No effect.  Kain rips off Operative A's weapon arm 
and grabs him by
the throat.}

Kain: A survivor from the Galaxy Police, hmm.  What magnificent spirit you've 
shown in tracking me all the way here.

[Crow: (As Operative A) Yep! Keep 'em in a flask in my pocket!]

Operative A: Kain, I'm going to get you, if it's the last thing I ever do.

Kain: How pitiful that your skill as an operative has helped seal your fate.  No 
one can withstand the power of Kain. {Begins to crush Operative A.}

Operative A: RRRAAAHHHAAAHHH!

Mitsuki: {In horror.}  NNNOOO!!! {Covers her eyes.}

{The background fades to black.  She opens her eyes to see the controls of the 
Lyex.  She looks to her side and sees herself one day ago.}

Mitsuki: This can't be happening!

[Tom: Again? I have to do this AGAIN?! NO!]

{The Lyex lands just outside the battle zone.}

Mitsuki: {Over the built in PA system.} Illirg, or should I say Kain!  You owe 
me.

{Fighting stops and all characters look at Mitsuki.}

Illirg: {Laughing.} Oh, man!  This gets better!
[Crow: He said that before, and it hasn't.]
 {Power change to Kagato.  Creates an evil energy sword.} Come get some.

{Illirg slices off the laser arm.  The Lyex fires the machine guns on the left 
arm only to have
them reflect and nail it in the left side of the robot's abdomen, damaging the 
power cell.  It
tries to grab the beast's neck.  Illirg power changes to Kain.  His thorax opens 
into a
dimensional gate.  The robot's arm in enveloped.  The gate closes leaving the 
mech disarmed.}

Mitsuki: {Frantic.} YOU BASTARD!!!

Mitsuki: Stop it!  There's been enough fighting. {Tries to slap her other self.}

{On impact her hand passes through the face.}

Mitsuki: {Tries to grab the controls to no avail.} I must stop this!  Someone 
must!

{The Lyex falls to the ground.}

Mitsuki: {Raving madly.} DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT!!!

[Tom: Ugghhh, I'm getting confused, which one is speaking?]
[Mike: Can't you read? Mitsuki!
[Tom: Yeah, but WHICH ONE?!?!]
[Mike: Uh....um...]
[Crow: Yes.]

Illirg: {Enraged.} EAT THIS!!! {Grabs Ryo-Ohki and throws her into the Lyex.}

Mitsuki & Mitsuki: {Closing her eyes.} AAAHHH!!!

{Her eyes open onto the medical room in MIBHQ.  Here, Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, 
Kiyone, and J stand
pondering their next move.}

Mitsuki: {Confused.} What?

Ryoko: {Charging.} Mitsuki!

Kiyone: {Pulling her weapon.} Just hold it right there!

Mitsuki: {Sitting up.} Wait, wait, wait!  I'm sorry!  I won't attack you 
anymore!  I swear!

Ryoko: Why should we trust you?

Kiyone: You've put us in harm's way too many times!

Mitsuki: {Apologetically.} I understand that, and I'd like to end my hatred 
towards you.  A
        couldn't understand, nor could I until I nearly lost my life to Illirg.  
We cannot change
        the past with what we do now.  I want to help you defeat Illirg.

Ayeka: We've already destroyed Illirg, but his creator is here.  Nerti is highly 
powerful.

Tenchi: If you'll behave, you can help us face her.  We need all the help we can 
get.

J: Right.

Ryoko: {Allows the charge to dissipate.  Wary.} Okay...

[Crow: (As Ryoko)...NOT! BOOM!]

Kiyone: {Puts down her weapon and walks to Mitsuki.  Glad.} I'm happy you've 
come to your senses.

Tenchi: Now, we need a plan.

J: Kiyone, Mitsuki, and me can keep her busy so you three can attack.

Ayeka: And, if she is distracted enough, she could be destroyed!

Ryoko: We need more power to get through that field over her power systems.

Tenchi: The three of us together could have enough.

Mitsuki: It seems we have no choice but to attack her.
[Tom: Oh, what else could you do!? Ask her if she wants to talk about it over 
tea?!]
 Could you explain how powerful she is?

Kiyone: Yes.

{The group begins to explain the situation.  Wipe to Zed's office where Nerti 
has her captives
still encased in fields on each side of Zed's desk.  Nerti stands at the door 
preparing to
leave.}

Zed: What are you waiting for?  You wanted to kill me so kill me already!

Nerti: No, not just yet. 
[Mike: You bore me.]
You see, I hate humans, but I also hate the aliens that marry and reproduce with 
humans.  You are not as important as Tenchi Masaki.  I want him dead!

Washu: That'll be tough since you'll have to fight the other four to get to him.

Nerti: I doubt it.  They could not defeat me earlier.  How could they now?

L: Why do you hate us?

Nerti: My creator was a friend of a human, Edward William Pii.  They were the 
best of friends.
Everyone hated him but her.  By belief the humans carry a disease of stupidity.
[Crow: Well, she might have a point about that.]
[Mike: Yeah, I think...HEY!]
[Tom: (Tries to suppress a laugh)] 
I concluded that Evil Pii infected my creator so I exiled her and vowed the 
destruction of
Earth.  Evil Pii has fought me since.

Washu: You don't understand people very well.

Nerti: Regardless, you all will have your turn at my blade after I destroy 
Tenchi Masaki. {Walks
out the door.}

Sasami: Washu, can we get out and help Tenchi and Ayeka?

Washu: Unfortunately no.  I can't even create my computer in here.  The field 
strength is too
high.

Mihoshi: Maybe I can get us out. {Pulls her weapon.}

L, Zed, Washu, & Sasami: Mihoshi!  NO!

{Mihoshi fires upon the field.  The shot ricochets within the sphere.  Zed, L, 
and Mihoshi duck
and dodge the shot until it is finally absorbed by the shield.}


Zed & L [Mike and bots]: Mihoshi!

Mihoshi: {Crying.} I'm sorry!  I just want to escape!

Zed: As we all do.  We'll have to wait on the others to rescue us.

Washu: If they can.

{Fade to black.}

[Tom: Uh...did I go blind?]
[Mike: No, its the movie.]
[Tom: Darn.]

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{In a MIB corridor Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Kiyone, J, and Mitsuki cautiously walk.  
They come to a
door.}

J: Stop.

{Group stops.}

J: This's the armory.  Kiyone, Mitsuki, and me can rearm here.

Tenchi: We'll go on ahead.

Ayeka: Please hurry.  We should not be separated long.

Ryoko: Good luck.

Kiyone: Thanks.

Mitsuki: We may need it.

{Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko walk on.  J opens the door.  Kiyone, J, and Mitsuki 
enter.  Weapons
drip off the walls.  Kiyone finds a GP armor suit (similar to Mihoshi's in 
TM!TV#1) and a GP
Gatling gun.  Mitsuki enjoys the GP mech suit (TM!TV#1 & 5) sitting in the 
corner.  J finds a
nice and proper SUIT of armor and the latest MIB weapon, a shoulder mount, body 
length rifle.}

[Mike: How convenient! They just happen to have 2 GP armor suits!]
[Tom: Gee, what are the odds of that?]

J: {Checking the sights of the rifle.} This is sweet!

Kiyone: {Putting on the armor.} Like it or not, we should be ready for her now.

Mitsuki: {Moving in the mech.} Agreed.  Ready?

J & Kiyone: Yes.

{Together, the officers head for the door.  Suddenly, Nerti appears in the 
doorway.}

Nerti: The hunt is on!

[Crow: We don't have much ammo, only aim for torphy bucks!]

Mitsuki: {Flying up to point.} You two get away!

Kiyone: No!  We just got you back!

Mitsuki: {Solemn.} Kiyone, I know you and the others will survive.  Please go.

J: {Grabs Kiyone's arm and pulls her with him.} Come on, Kiyone!

{Kiyone and J run out a back door.}

Mitsuki: {Aiming the arm cannon at Nerti.} Now, you recreated Kain.  You deserve 
to die.

Nerti: I don't have time for you.

Mitsuki: I don't care! {Fires at Nerti.}

{Wipe to Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko.}

[Tom: (Makes squeaking sounds)

Ryoko: We haven't seen Nerti in awhile.

Ayeka: Yes.  She may be looking or waiting for us.

Tenchi: Never mind that.  We need to return to Zed's office and rescue Washu, 
Zed, and the
others.

{Running can be heard in the background.  Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko turn to see 
Kiyone and J
running towards them.  An explosion rocks from behind Kiyone and J.  Kiyone and 
J pass them.
Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko join the rush.}

Ryoko: What's the hurry?

[Mike: They're having a 2 for 1 sale on guns down at Bargain Clown!]

J: Nerti!

Ayeka: Where?

Kiyone: Behind us!

{Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko look back to see Nerti flying hurriedly toward them.  
Ryoko turns to fire.}

Tenchi: Where's Mitsuki?

Kiyone: She faced Nerti to save us.

Ayeka: {Gasps.} How terrible!

[Tom: Yet...effective.]

J: {Turning to fire on Nerti.} Come get soma this, Nerti! {Fires.}

Kiyone: {Turns to Nerti.} You'll regret facing the Galaxy Police! {Fires.}

{No effect.  All run into Zed's office.}

[Crow: Yep! She really regretted it!]

Nerti: So, we have come full circle.

Ryoko: But, we'll win this time! {Fires.}

{J and Kiyone join the attack.  Nerti places her scythe before her and twirls 
it.  All shots
reflect.}

[All: (Act like they're ducking reflected shots]

Washu: She's adapted to your attacks!  Try something else!

[Crow: Ok, I'll stand here and scratch my butt. Does that help?}

J: Okay. {Runs toward Nerti to clothesline her with the rifle barrel.}

{Kiyone fires all barrels of the Gatling gun simultaneously covering J's attack.  
Nerti slices
off J's rifle allowing him to hit his head on the wall knocking him unconscious.  
Nerti points
her scythe at Kiyone and fires.  Kiyone is thrown backward into Zed's desk 
unconscious.}

Nerti: And now, for no more interruptions...
[Tom: (Old schoolteacher voice) ...you all will get detentions!] 
{Spins her scythe above her head creating a glowing dome around Tenchi, Ayeka, 
Ryoko, and herself.  Stops spinning the scythe, and the background turns black 
save for a single light above them.}...Tenchi will die!

Tenchi: {Activating the Tenchiken.} No, I won't!

Ayeka: {Her tiara glows green.} You shall not hurt Lord Tenchi!

Ryoko: {Forming an energy sword.} I won't let you touch Tenchi!

{Ayeka fires.  Tenchi runs to cut Nerti.  Ryoko flies to cut Nerti.  Nerti 
simply holds her
scythe with both hands and blocks all three attacks throwing Tenchi and Ryoko 
into Ayeka.  The
three heros land in a pile.}

Ryoko: {Looking at the scythe.  In her mind.} That scythe is her power...

Nerti: {Walks to the group.} Now, the universe shall be purified of Earth. 
[Mike: (as Nerti) ...and of all of its crummy crossover fan fics!]
{Raises her scythe for the final blow.}

{Evil Pii flies in and tackles Nerti.  He flies up and hovers.  He presses two 
keys on the
gauntlets allowing a laser rifle and a flamethrower to emerge from the backpack 
and the gauntlets
to become on the right a laser, the left an explosive dart launcher.  He reaches 
back fusing the
wrist mount triggers to the hilts of the larger guns.}

Evil Pii: {Aiming at Nerti.} Use the Power! {Fires.}

[Crow: (as Pii) ...of Jell-o!]

Nerti: {Flying up to Evil Pii.} Insufferable human!  You have interfered for the 
final time!

Evil Pii: Yes, because you will be no more.

{Nerti reaches Evil Pii and slices the weapons from his gauntlets and thrusts 
him into the
ground.  He begins to stand when Nerti aims the scythe and fires.  Evil Pii is 
knocked down
unconscious.  Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko stand.  Ayeka's cylinders appear around 
Nerti and
energize.  Nerti grabs her chest and falls to the ground.}

[Tom: Guys, I've noticed something.]
[Mike and Crow: What?]
[Tom: Evil Pii and Mitsuki are punching bags.]
[Crow: Yeah, you're right? I mean, how much total damage have they done, total?]
[Mike: Well, Pii threw Nerti down to the ground...]
[Tom: ...and?]
[Mike: Uh, that's about it.]

Nerti: {Standing.} You will wish you never did that!

{Ayeka moves the cylinders around her once more and energizes them.  Nerti grabs 
her chest.
Ryoko runs past Nerti slicing off her scythe hand and discards it ten meters 
away.  Ayeka's
field stops.}

Nerti: {Grabbing the stub of her arm.} RYOKO! {Faces her other palm at Ryoko.}

{On Nerti's palm there is a small hole.  From there a set of prongs come out.  
Electricity
bounces from tip to tip forming a sphere in the center.  Nerti sends this sphere 
at Ryoko where
it hits her in right leg.}

Ryoko: {Falls down grabbing her leg.} AAAHHH!!!

Tenchi: Ayeka, take down her shields!

Ayeka: Yes. {Energizes cylinders.}

[All: Vroooooomm! Vrooom!]

{Nerti falls in pain.  Tenchi comes up to Nerti.  She grabs the Tenchiken hilt 
in his hand and
keeps it from falling on her.}

Nerti: {Pleading.} Please don't.  William, I'm sorry.  Please, Tenchi, let me 
help him.

{Tenchi, dissipating the blade, and Ayeka ease off.}

Nerti: {Laughing.} Gullible fool! {Takes the sword from Tenchi's hand and throws 
him down.} Such
a fool for such a ploy!

{Tenchi faces the palm of his hand at the Tenchiken.  A bolt of Jurai Energy 
flies from his hand
to the hilt creating a temporary blade that strikes through her power systems.}

Nerti: {Powering down.} N...N...N...o...o...o...... {Drops the Tenchiken and 
falls to the ground
lifeless.}

{The background returns to Zed's office all five characters from the dome 
reappear.  The shields
about the captives disintegrate.  They all rush around the wounded.  Fade out.}

End Scene 3

Scene 4

{Tenchi voice-over.  In the starship hangar Washu stands typing on her laptop.  
Industrial
machines move over Yagami making various repairs.  Quickly, Yagami is fully 
repaired.  Kiyone
and Mihoshi walk in and board Yagami.}

Tenchi: With Nerti defeated, Washu was able to begin the needed repairs on 
Yagami.  Soon enough
Kiyone and Mihoshi were able to return to their patrols.

{In the medical room Ryoko sits on a bed being examined by L.  Ryo-Ohki sits 
next to Ryoko.
Evil Pii lies on another bed unconscious.}

Tenchi: L healed Ryoko's leg wound better than before.  Ryoko was so impressed 
that she vowed to
never commit a crime again.  Who knows how long it'll last.

{Ryoko flies up and does several aerial maneuvers.  Ryo-Ohki meows happily.  
Turn to Evil Pii.}

Tenchi: However, Evil Pii is still comatose.  L can do nothing for him.

{In Zed's office Zed sits at his desk with Ayeka and Sasami across from him.  
Workers repair the
damage sustained earlier.  Ayeka curtsies, and she and her sister leave.}

Tenchi: Ayeka and Sasami negotiated with the Juraian government to send Zed some 
help with the
repair of the Men In Black Headquarters.  In return the MIB sent R as a 
representative to Jurai.

[Tom: (Sarcastically) Gee, I wonder if he's going to enjoy his promotion?]

{In orbit a Juraian ship flies away.  R is seen clinging to a window screaming 
his head off. 

[Mike: Guess not!]

In the armory J and other MIB agents find the pieces of a GP mech suit.}

Tenchi: Also, J found the remains of Mitsuki's mech suit, but there's been no 
sign of her body.

{In Washu's lab Washu has Nerti's remains connected to a computer.  Washu faces 
a screen where a
map comes up with one location marked.  Washu presses a key, and Nerti's remains 
burst into
flames and melt.  She leaves.  The scene changes to Zed's office.  Washu speaks.  
Zed then turns
to a screen and talks to a GP officer.}

Tenchi: As for Nerti's remains, Washu used them to find Nerti's lab.  Zed called 
the GP to
destroy all of Nerti's genetic data on Ryoko, Kagato, Kain, and the bug race so 
another
Illirg can never be created again.  Me?  I'm ready to go home.

{End voice-over.}

[Crow: ...and I'm ready to puke.]

{In the medical room Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Washu, and Ryo-Ohki gather 
their belongings
and prepare to leave.  Sasami walks to Evil Pii's bedside.}

Sasami: Who's he, Ayeka?

[Tom: Some guy that kept getting beat up all the time.]

Ayeka: Someone wanting revenge.

Sasami: What's wrong with him?

[Crow: He's a little wuss.]

Ayeka: L does not know.  He is in perfect health and still cannot wake.

Voice: Who cares about him?

[Mike: Well said, Voice!]

{All turn to the door to see Mitsuki walk in.}

Tenchi: Mitsuki?  You're alive?

Mitsuki: Yes.  Ya think I'd be killed like that?

Ryoko: How'd you escape Nerti?

Mitsuki: Well...

{Mitsuki voice-over.  Flashback to when J and Kiyone ran out.  Mitsuki fires on 
Nerti with the
GP mech suit arm cannon.}

Mitsuki: Nerti and I fought.  Nerti destroyed my armor, but, unlike Mihoshi, I 
know how to use
the escape systems.

{Nerti knocks the blast with her scythe back toward Mitsuki.  Inside the armor 
Mitsuki says a
command.  She disappears as the blast returns and destroys the suit.  End 
Flashback.}

Mitsuki: I've been in the ventilation ducts until I found out that Nerti was 
dead.

[Tom: Yeah, I would've helped, but I'm also a wuss.]

Washu: Smooth!

Ayeka: What will you do now?


[Mike: I'M GOING TO DISNEYWORLD!]
[Crow: ...to get beat up by Goofy.]

Mitsuki: Well, my ship is repaired.  I guess I'll return to the Galaxy Police.  
Tell Kiyone she
owes me for saving her life. {Leaves again.}

Tenchi: We should leave too.

Ayeka: Yes.

Ryoko: Okay, the fun's done. 

[Tom: Fun?! When did it start?]

Ryo-Ohki!

{Ryo-Ohki transforms and hovers over the roofless room.  Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, 
Washu, and Sasami
are transported onboard.  Ryo-Ohki flies away into the sunset.  Back in the 
medical room L enters
and reexamines Evil Pii.}

L: What could be wrong with you?

{Evil Pii's right hand shoots up and grabs L's collar.}

L: {Surprised.} AAAHHH!!!

Evil Pii: Where am I?

L: MIB Headquarters!

{Evil Pii releases L and stands.  He walks about looking at the entire room.}

Evil Pii: Interesting.  But, I have places to go and people to annoy.

L: What?

Evil Pii: While I was in the dimensional nexus, I saw an alternate reality where 
my doppelganger
existed as a boring student of mathematics.  I've decided to...liven up his 
life.  Maybe
I can find my friend Nerti.

L: You're going to a parallel dimension???

Evil Pii: Oh yeah! {Presses a key on his gauntlet.}

{A rip in space-time appears before him.}

Evil Pii: Give Tenchi and company a big thank you for the death of the metal 
Nerti. (Gives the
peace sign.} Later! {Steps through the rift.}

[Mike: ...and gets ripped to shreads, therefore never having a chance to star in 
his own Tenchi crossover]
[Mike and bots start to get out of theater]
[Tom: You think we'll be that lucky?]
[Crow: Was this fic good?]
[All sigh and exit theater]

{White screen.}

End Act 7


DOOR SEQUENCE:  .....1.....2.....3.....4.....5.....6.....

Crow: Oh man! That is THE worst thing I ever seen!
Tom: No kidding! This is ten times worse than any movie!
Mike: I don't know...what about Parts?
Crow: Wellll....

A light flashes on the table.

Mike: Oh, looks like Pearl is back. (Taps light)

Cut to Castle F

Pearl, Brain Guy, and the MiB are talking, and Bobo is on the computer.

BG: Well, I'm glad we cleared up this misunderstanding.
L: Just remember, you have to check in with us if you go off-planet, 
and your licence expires in 4 years.
J: Just visit headquarters before then to get it renewed.
Bobo: YES! DIE YOU UGLY SCUM! HOOHAHOOHAHOO! COME GET SOME!!!
MiB, Pearl, and Brain Guy look over at him.  Pearl remembers what he has 
punishment coming.
Pearl: Gee, does anyone want to play Duke Nukem?
BG: Well, I'm kind of busy...oh, why not?
Brain Guy uses his powers and Bobo disappears. Brain Guy, Pearl, and MiB go to 
the computer.
Pearl: I go first!
Pearl takes the controls as everyone else watches. The camara zooms onto the 
monitor and we see that Bobo is in the game.  
Bobo: What the...?
Pearl arms Nukem with the Rocket Launcher
Bobo: Umm...AGGGGGHHHHHHHH! (Starts to run away)
We can see a reflection on the monitor of everyone else smiling evily.
Duke Nukem: It's just you and me, you furry freak!
