Fantasy Island - The Anime
By Happosai <happosai@jps.net>


It sounds interesting. I'd read it, but I don't have time to write it.

"Ah. And this is Detective Kiyone, of the Galaxy Police."

"What's her fantasy, boss?"

"To be permanently separated from her partner, Detective Mihoshi. And here
comes Detective Mihoshi now."

"Does Mihoshi have a fantasy?"

"Yes, Tattoo. It's to be Detective Kiyone's partner, forever."

"But how are you going to fullfill both their fantasies, boss?"

"We shall see, Tattoo. We shall see. And this man next man is Tatewaki
Kuno..."

(Seen in someone's .sig a few years ago):

"Say, boss, do *you* have a fantasy?"

"Why, yes, Tattoo. It's to see you drive a brand new Chrysler Cordoba,
apholstered with fine Corinthian leather, off the cliff at the other end
of the island."

"Oh, I don't like that fantasy, boss."
