Okay...
I hope this hasn't been done before; I don't think it has.
Presumably because people have had more sense.

This is officially the WORST idea that I've ever had.

Thank God I'm not going to make it into a series.

Ranma balanced on a pole, high above the pools. He was looking down at
the Spring he'd just knocked his father into. Seemed a little quiet.

"Ohhh, Sir! Very bad you fall in spring!"

"Why?"

"All springs have curse! You turn into whatever drown there! And that
Spring of drowned..." The guide was cut off as a panda leapt out of the
water, and sent Ranma flying. "...panda," the guide finished lamely.

Ranma was at the bottom of the pool for a long time. The guide pulled
out a map, and went ashen.

"SIR! YOU RUN NOW!"

"Growf?"

A short, red-haired girl climbed out of the pond She had a mane of spiky
red hair, and a devious expression on her face.

"THAT SPRING OF DROWNED WASHUU!"
