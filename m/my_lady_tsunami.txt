                              My Lady Tsunami

O fairest of the fair
What is it about you that makes my heart race?
Is it your pretty pink eyes, or your beautiful blue hair?
Is it your warm kindness, or your gorgeous, round face?

O loveliest of the lovely
What is it about you that makes my soul complete?
Is it your serene smile, or your cute little nose?
Could it be your innocent curiosity, or is it the sound of your heartbeat?

O purist of the pure
What is it about you that makes my mind stir?
Is it your loving gentleness, or your elegant grace?
Could it be your endless patience or is it the way you light up a place?

O possessor of my fragile heart
What is it about you that would make my life completely void without you?
Is it the love I see in your eyes, or the look of care on your face?
Could it be your passionate kiss, or your fiery embrace?

Author’s notes: Well, I wasn’t going to submit this poem, but a friend, who
is also a fan of my stories, urged me to. Writing poetry usually isn’t my
cup of tea, but I felt compelled to write a poem about the most beautiful
goddess in the universe. I’ve poured my heart into this, and I hope you
enjoyed it despite my lack of poetic skill. Please send me all of your
complements, flames, criticism, etc. I appreciate all comments that I
receive about my stories.
