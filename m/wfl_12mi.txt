Windir: Yes.

Lyra: So now we do the follow-up?

>  However, the same force that had attempted to block her scans of 
>the warp was at it again, returning false echoes, ghost images, and 
>generally making a pest of itself. There was a definite intelligence 
>behind the blocks, and Washu was beginning to suspect the identity 
>of her opponent. 

Lyra: Hmmm. The plot thickens. Conclusive proof, at least, that it was 
*not* Washu.

>  "I'll let you know in a moment, Commander." LaForge turned to the 
>Engineering station. "Computer, transfer Engineering controls to this 
>station." He sat down and began working. "There was a brief surge of 
>energy in the transporter field right before she was supposed to 
>re-materialize. I'm attempting to determine the cause of the energy 
>surge now." 

Frito: Awww. No more Treknobabble!

Windir: Eh?

Frito: It all makes sense!

Lyra: Oh.

>  The glowering face of a Romulan woman filled the main screen. 
>"Attention Federation vessel. I am Captain Kila of the Romulan Warship 
>Yev'ash. You have entered the Neutral Zone in violation of treaty. We  
>demand that you withdraw immediately." 

Windir: I still think this is a little too convenient...

>  "Is that a threat, Captain?" Kila asked warily. 
>  "An observation." Picard replied. 
>  Captain Kila paused for a moment, thinking. Before she could say 
>more, an aide stepped up beside her and hurridly whispered in her 
>ear. Kila's eyes widened slightly and she nodded. "Captain Picard, 
>I shall.... consider what you have said. Now I have pressing matters 
>to attend to." 
>  With that, the screen went blank. 
>  Picard turned. "What was that all about?" 
>  "Something's wrong." Troi answered. "Whatever it was that she was 
>told, it surprised her. Surprised her so badly that she doesn't  
>consider us to be much of a threat right now." 
>  "That would have to be some surprise." Riker commented. Then he 
>frowned, turning the pink cube over in his hands. "You don't think..." 

Lyra: Uh-oh... 

Frito: Huh.

Windir: I believe I am beginning to suspect the reason *why* the author 
brought the Romulans into the story.

Frito: Yeah, since da Klingons ain't enemies no more. Ain't dat a waste 
of a good enemy?

>"I'll ask you one last time." the Romulan officer spat, "What are you 
>doing aboard this vessel?" 
>  "I don't know!" Mihoshi whined, her voice raising in pitch with 
>each word. "I was on my ship, and Yukinojo said that another ship had 
>arrived, so I decided to try and call up a cup of coffee, but my cube 
>wasn't working right, and then the Enterprise said that they were going 
>to beam me back - which is a really strange feeling, I might add. Kinda 
>like sitting in a fizzy soda, not that I've ever actually *done* some- 
>thing like that, but I bet that that's what it would feel like if I  
>actually-" 

Lyra: Another nice Mihoshi bit. :)

>  "Yes, Captain. She was found in the aft cargo hold." He shot a 
>withering glance at Mihoshi. "So far she hasn't been very cooperative." 

Frito: Aw, but she was *tryin'*!

>  "Liar! Centurians!" Kila shouted. Two glowering Centurians entered 
>the room. "Take this spy to the brig!" 

Lyra: Um, I believe you mean Centurions. Centurians would be from Alpha 
Centuari. :)

>  "I see." Picard mused, looking at Sasami. "Sasami, we have a small 
>mystery on our hands, and we're hoping that you can shed some light 
>on the situation." He motioned towards his command chair. "Would you 
>like to sit down?" 

Frito: Don't look like he's no better with children!

Lyra: And a rather... interesting... target of condescension in Sasami. :)

>"Hello? Hello!" Mihoshi's shrill cry rang out from the brig. "I need to 
>use the toilet! Please, let me out of here!" 
>  Looking out from behind the force field, Mihoshi chewed her lower 
>lip. "Where did everyone go?" she wondered aloud. "Why haven't they 
>come to let me use the toilet?" Her eyes wandered around the cell 
>she found herself in, then focused on a small panel mounted on the 
>far wall. It was covered with symbols she couldn't understand. 
>  Walking over to the panel, she leaned forward slightly and pressed 
>on it. She yelped as the panel swung open with a loud *CLACK*, then 
>broke off of its mountings and fell to the floor. "Oh dear." she 
>muttered to herself, peering inside the exposed cavity. There were 
>numerous cables and conduits and small colored cubes, as well as 
>four objects that looked like buttons. 
>  "I know what this is!" Mihoshi announced happily. "Just like the 
>utility controls back at the Academy!" She frowned, slightly. "But 
>which one opens the door to the bathroom?" She closed her eyes, 
>concentrating. "Oh, I never was good at multiple-choice tests!" Eyes 
>still closed, Mihoshi began chanting. "Eeeny, meeny, miney, Moe!"  
>She stabbed the third button. Nothing.  
>  "Meeny!" she said, stabbing the first button. Nothing. 
>  "Miney?" The second button. Still nothing. 
>  "Eeeny?" she sobbed, pressing the fourth - and last - button. 
>  There was a muffled sizzle, then the force field sealing the cell  
>flashed and went dark. 
>  All too aware of the growing pressure in her abdomen, Mihoshi 
>walked out of the cell, into the hallway beyond, and looked around.  
>"Hello? Hello? Is there anyone out here?" There was no answer.  
>"Guess I'm going to have to find the toilet all by myself." 
>  With that, she began walking. 

[Editor's note: Ghu, this was too good to cut. :)]

Lyra: <Wiping tears from her eyes> L-love it! <Breaks into chuckles again.

Windir: <Coughing a bit> Truly *classic* Mihoshi. 

Frito: Bwa-ha-ha....

>-------------------------------------------------------- 
> 
>And thus, Chapter 6 comes to a close - and Mihoshi is turned 
>loose on an unsuspecting Romulan crew  ^_^ 

Lyra: Well, *now* do you admit this was justified?

Windir: <Looking as if he'd bit into a very large lemon> <<Yes, pun 
*intended.*>> Very well. I am forced to admit that it may indeed have 
been justified. Perhaps.

Frito: Aw, don't be such a sore loser!

Windir: I *still* believe that the introduction needs to flow more 
naturally from the story.

Lyra & Frito: <Sigh>

[Editor's note: Sigh is right. Another one-paragraph quick comment turns 
into a C&C.]
