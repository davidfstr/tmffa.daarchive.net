Mihoshi

Don't call me a fool,
because I sleep in the sunshine,
instead of sniping at you.

"Who's the fool?"
I ask myself 
as I give a sweet smile,
to the object of my desire.

I don't battle for the love
of  he who loves peace.
and I'M a fool?

I live a life of joy,
of freedom from pain.
I can share that life.
that he enjoys so well
and I'M a fool?

I comfort (not tease)
I listen (not cajole)
I feel (not fear)
I love (not possess)
and I'M a fool?

We shall see, 
in the end
"Who's the fool?"
