Well, crap.  If that line doesn't open up Pandora's box then nothing will.  I
can just see it now..

Tenchi wandered into the living room one day to watch a little TV and relax.
Seeing as there was nothing good on (even with 5000 galactic channels), Tenchi
decided pop in a tape.  Before he could, he noticed one already in the player.
"Hmm, what's this?" he thought to himself.  He put the tape back in the VCR
and hit play.

LATER ON..

Tenchi and the others sat dumbfounded in front of the television, each with a
look of horror plastered across their faces.

"How...How is this possible?"  Ryoko asked.

"I don't know, all scientific knoweledge of human anatomy goes against what
we're seeing here."  Washu answered.

"Gee, that looks painful.  How did they do that without killing each other?"
Mihoshi asked, wide-eyed.

"I..have..never..been..so..so..so.." Aeka stuttered in a mixture of rage and
pure horror.

"Uhh....umm.."  Tenchi continued to stare on in catotonic shock.

At that moment, the door to the house slid open, and the gang was met with a
smiling Nobuyuki and Sasami holding each other's hands.

"Guess what everybody!"  Sasami chirpped out with joy.
