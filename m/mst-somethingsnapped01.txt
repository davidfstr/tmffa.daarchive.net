:::The theater doors slam shut and our four brave souls are locked in:::
:::All, except for the usual hentai Ryu, bang madly with their fists:::
Arianna: Let us outta here!!!!
Sammy: Come on!!
Akito: Damn it we've had enough!!
Elena: Uh Uh Uh...
:::All three pause then facefault:::
All three: Pleeeease!
Elena: Sit down and just watch the darn fic okay!? Believe it or not this
one
isn't so bad.
Sammy: That's what you said about-...er...um...nevermind
Elena: That's right Sammy! I gave you all fair warning about the other ones!
Now please...SIT DOWN!!!
:::The three shake and catch their balance as the theater shakes then
eventually settles calm again:::
:::The three exchange looks then march to their seats, all muttering
particularly nasty things:::
:::As all four are seated the screen lights up:::

Something Snapped
--------------------------------

Sammy: This can't be good...
Arianna: Is this a lemon?
Sammy: I don't know...let's hope not :::claps her hands together in
prayer:::

             I can't believe he just did what he did.

Arianna: What'd he do?

             It's so... unexpected.

Sammy: What?!

But I should have realised something
was up when he went to see Washuu so frequently during the past week. I
hate thinking about this, but I've got to add this to my diary.

Ryu: Agggh! The suspense tell us already!

             First, he called me up to his room.

All: Uh oh...
Ryu: I smell lemon content
Arianna: :::mimicing Carol Anne from Poltergeist::: It's heeeeere

             Oh! There goes Ryoko! She'll not be looking so happy
soon...

Akito: Huh...?
Sammy: Who is this? Sasami or Aeka talking?

             "What is it, Ten-chan?" He was standing, and had a _very_
serious look on his face. And he seemed to have changed the layout a
bit. I didn't like this a bit.

Sammy: Neither do I mystery person

             "It's about you and Ryoko.

Sammy: So it's Aeka!

I'm SICK and TIRED of you two
always fighting over me and causing general HAVOC!"

Arianna: 'Bout time this boy got his anger out
Ryu: Vent your anger boy!!

             I began to get scared, and blustered. The way his voice
just leapt in volume for those words... "I-I'm sorry..."

Ryu: :::Tenchi::: Nothing shall save you from my wrath BWAHAHAHAHA!!!

             "Not good enough." He clapped his hands, twice, as if
commanding something. Two sets of mechanical tentacles whipped down from
the ceiling of the room, binding themselves around my arms and legs,
dragging me up towards a chair in the middle of the room.

Arianna: Please please...anything but tentacle sex...:::grimaces:::

"Azaka!
Kamidake! HELP!"

Akito: I do recall seeing a nice warm fire burning downstairs...

             "No use, princess. Washuu also generated a field which
means that they cannot respond to your cries."

Ryu: Who'd want to? I mean it's Aeka...:::shudders:::
Sammy: Ryu you don't like Aeka?
Ryu: Uh Uh...that girl is always wiggin! Poor Ryoko just goes up to Tenchi
to
say hi and BOOM! Aeka spazes...Someone shoot that girl with tranq darts
:::Other three blink:::

With that, I found myself
thrust over the back of the chair, and, to my shame, he pushed his hand
up my robe and pulled away my panties. I was sure that he was intending
rape.

Sammy: You're not the only one who's sure of that...
Arianna: I can't watch...graphic sex is one thing but rape is totally
another
issue...
Ryu: Way true. I'm not even into this...Hell not even AEKA deserves this...
Akito: I agree
:::all four hang their heads, looking at the floor:::

             "This is an assault on a royal person! This is TREASON!"

Arianna: Atleast she's resisting...

             "Even a princess of Jurai needs to be taken down a peg or
two, occasionally." He flipped up my robes.
             I hear screams starting.

:::All look up:::
Sammy: Heeey wait a minute! What's going on...? Now who's screaming? Aeka?
Akito: I don't think so...

Ryoko is finding out that Tenchi
has had enough.

Ryu and Akito: NOT RYOKO!!! DAMN YOU TENCHI!!!
:::Both boys are bright fire red and grit their teeth, ready to claw the
screen:::
Arianna: Men...
:::Both boys facefault:::

Heh.

Akito: You laugh at Ryoko!? That's it! :::lunges at the screen:::
AAAAAYYYAAH!!
Ryu: Whoa...oh uh yeah! :::Also charges::: YAAAAAH!!!
:::A sort of shield bounces both boys back off the screen, knocking them
into
next week:::
:::Sammy yawns, and Arianna watches the screen blankly:::

Apparently the field also prevents her
teleportation.

Arianna: Obviously...

             "Now. Do you know what this is?" Tenchi was holding out a
long, thin, stick, with a curved handle. I didn't know the name, but I
could guess what it was for.

Sammy: This is kinda confusing...I thought it was Ryoko just a sec ago...
Arianna: :::mimics Austin Powers::: Wait a tick!

             "You wouldn't!"

Both girls: Oh yes he would!

             "Oh, yes I would.

Both girls: See?

And I will."
             I counted twenty-four strokes before he let me go. And I
felt every one of them.

Sammy: Oooo...:::winces::: That'll put any plans on hold you had for biking
Arianna: And driving
Sammy: And walking
Arianna: An-
Elena: I GOT THE POINT!
:::Arianna and Sammy both blink then exchange glances and grin darkly:::
Arianna: And canoeing
Sammy: And riding rollercoasters...
:::continues:::

             This is why I am sitting on the edge of the arm of the
sofa.
             I have to say, though, he wasn't overly vicious.

Arianna: And running
Sammy: And-
:::Both boys, burnt chrisply and beaten, weakly stumble back to their seats
and look over at the girls who still continue:::
:::They sigh and look back at the screen:::

He just
made me scream, and I probably won't sit down properly for several days.

Akito: Ouch...Serious spanking
Ryu: :::in a physcotic voice::: Heh heh heh...Aeka's beeeeeeen naughty...heh
heh heh...FWAP FWAP!! Heh Heh Heh...

He did help me downstairs, afterwards.

Akito: That's nice...he just spanked the crap out of you and then he helps
you down the stairs...

His father and grandfather are
out, and he persuaded Washuu to look after Sasami.

Akito: Oh dear god...He left Sasami alone with WASHUU?!
Ryu: That's not good...

             I can hear the whistling cracks and Ryoko's screams. I'm
sure I didn't make that much noise.

Ryu: :::sweatdrop::: You'd be amazed...

             I have to admit, it wasn't much fun, being... caned (if
that's the right word)

Akito: Nah...lacerate is a much better word

but the immediate prelude was surprisingly
pleasurable. The anticipation...
             I wonder if he'll do it again?

Akito: She wants more? :::Blinks:::
Ryu: :::Sings::: Just beat it!

             "Hey, oneechan!"
             Sasami has come back. I turn a a still watery smile to her.
             "Oneechan... have you been crying? Why are you sitting
funny?"

Akito: You don't want to know Sasami

             "Ask Ryoko, Imouto-chan. She will be along in a minute."
Very true. the screams have stopped. Maybe she passed out?

:::Akito looks in worry then passes out himself:::
Ryu: Uh...Akito...?

             No. Here comes Tenchi now, supporting a very upset Ryoko.

:::Akito stands immediatly, shaking his fist::: DAMN RIGHT SHE'S PISSED!

             Tenchi looks directly at Washuu, who pales. Oho ho ho...

Akito and Ryu: ........

---End---

Ryu: Whoa...that wasn't bad!
Akito: Aside from the fact that he beat poor Ryoko!
Ryu: Calm down ! She ain't even real!
Akito: I'm calm...I'm fine...
Sammy: And swimming
Arianna: And hiking
Sammy: And excersing
Arianna: An-
Akito: What's with them?
Ryu: Got me
:::The theater doors slam open and a very angry Elena walks in, gritting her
teeth and holds up a huge mallet:::
:::Arianna and Sammy's jaws drop at once and they are silent:::
Elena: AAAAARRRRGHHH!!! ::runs after both girls:::
Both girls: AAAHH!!! :::They run and end up running from the theater with
Elena close behind them:::
Akito: ......
Ryu: ......
Akito: Well that fic wasn't so bad...Except for the Ryoko part
Ryu: I kinda liked it. Cleverly done with a dash of lemon.
Akito: Yeah...I could get use to this MST thing...
Ryu: Oh yeah! Especially if it's going to end like that :::points to the
doorway and both guys grin then casually walk out of the theater:::
