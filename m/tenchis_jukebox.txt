don’t sue!

Hello and welcome to the first edition of Tenchi Jukebox, because if I ever 
get ill again which is more than likely there will be another one, sorry. 
This is where I take completely random songs and well Tenchify them. If you 
want to blame someone/something for this blame the common cold, if it 
weren’t for the common cold I wouldn’t be sat here right now with a word 
processor and the internet full of lyrics. Now on with the show!

(Tenchi)
Every night they walk right in on my dreams
Since I met them from the start
I'm so sad I am the only one
Who is special in their hearts
(Ryoko)
The boy is mine
The doggone boy is mine
I know he's mine
Because the doggone boy is mine
(Ayeka)
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that he's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
(Ryoko)
Because he's mine
The doggone boy is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone boy is mine
(Ayeka)
I love him more than you
(Ryoko)
But I love him endlessly
(Ryoko & Ayeka to Tenchi)
So come and go with me
Two on the town
(Ryoko)
But we both cannot have him
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That he's my Tenchi forever and ever
(Ayeka)
Don't bulid your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
(Ryoko)
I know he'll tell you I'm the one for him
'Cause he said I blow her mind
The boy is mine
The doggone boy is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone boy is mine
He's mine, he's mine
No, no, no, he's mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
(Ayeka)
The boy is mine, (yep) he's mine
The boy is mine, (yes) he's mine
(Ryoko)
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
(Ayeka)
Ryoko, we're not going to fight about this, okay
(Michael)
Ayeka, I think I told you, I love a fight
(Ayeka)
I've heard it all before Ryoko, he told me that I'm his forever lover, you 
know, don't you remember
(Michael)
Well, after loving me, he said he couldn't love another
(Paul)
Is that what he said
(Michael)
Yes, he said it, you keep dreaming
(Paul)
I don't believe it
(Ryoko & Ayeka)
The boy is mine (mine, mine, mine)

Originally by Michael Jackson. Not a bad one actually not much needed to be 
changed, I’m picking these at random so they won’t all be this easy, I’ll 
keep going till I get kicked off. And now and old queen favourite.

(Tenchi)
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need sympathy
Because they’re not easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mihoshi, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled the trigger, now he's dead
My life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Sasami, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, the time has come
Sends shivers down my spine (and everybodys)
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and pick carrots
Sasami, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to screw you
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man (Happosai)
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me
Ayeka, Ryoko,
Ayeka, Ryoko,
Ayaka, Ryoko - please just go

But I'm just a poor boy and everybody loves me
(Sasami)
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
(Tenchi)
Easy come easy go - will you let me go
(The Other Girls)                                                      
(Sasami)
Bismillah! No - we will not let you go                       let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go                              let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go                              let me go
(Still the girls)		                                     (Tenchi)
Will not let you go                                                   let me 
go
Never let you go                                                      let me 
go
(Tenchi)
Never let me go - ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
All these girls has a devil put aside for me
for me
for me

So you think you can stone me and think I won’t know
So you think you can love me and not let me die
Oh Washu - can't do this to me Washu
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me

And now, the end is here. And so I face the final curtain. My friend, I'll 
say it clear I'll state my case, of which I'm certain. I've sorta made this 
full, I done a couple of songfics. And more, much more than this, I did it 
myyyyyyyyyyyyyy waaaaaaaay . Well this was the first installment of Tenchis 
jukebox there may be more, just preay I don’t get another cold. Send any 
flames, compliments, or indecent proposals to divine_aphrael@hotmail.com.
