Bambi Meets KAIN
----------------
(with apologies to the guys who wrote Bambi Meets Godzilla)

The little fawn frollicked merrily through the forest of Japan.
He rolled around in the leaves and scratched his back on a rough
barked tree. And finally, he went to the watering hole to get a
drink.

As he bent down to lap up the cool water, a thing like a comet
slammed into him and devoured him at incredible speed, leaving
nothing in its wake but a cool clear stream, a rough barked tree,
and a charred streak of grass.
