I was wondering about that, given that "Mount Fuji"="Fuji-san", but I just 
assumed that the page was right, given that it was from Japan. Thanks for 
the correction.

"Where are you going, Tenchi?" asked Sasami, as Tenchi, flanked by Ryoko 
and Aeka, opened the front door.

Tenchi turned and smiled. "We're going to meet Mihoshi and Kiyone at their 
apartment, then all of us are taking a trip down to the coast to see 
Washuu-san. Want to come with us?"

"Washuu-*CHAN*!" a voice said sharply, just before the resident genius of 
the Masaki household walked around the corner. "And besides, what are you 
talking about? I'm right here."

"Oh, sorry. I didn't mean you, I meant Washuu-san, the hill outside of 
town." Tenchi frowned. "You know, that's a really weird coincidence, now 
that I think about it."



Hasheen!
