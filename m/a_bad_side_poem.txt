Here's a little poem I thought up that takes place after my lemon fic, 
enjoy! ^_^

************

Tenchi Masaki, age 16, is exhausted beyone belief.				
	
Lying naked on the floor, thinking abut his grief.
Next to him, Ryoko lies, snoring like a bear,
His penis rubs against her cyan pubic hair.
"Why o' why did this have to happen to me?
I've been good, I've done my chores.damn I have to pee."
He turns his head real slowly, to the clock upon the wall,
"8:15" it says to him, he has to scratch his balls.
He tries to move his arms, but it's cramped beyond compare
I have no words to rhyme with that, I'm caught up in a snare
Slowly he turns his head, to look at his friend Broka,
He has a smile on his face, he looks content, like he just had a smoka
In his grasp, Ayeka lays, sleeping like a baby,
His penis shoved up in her ass, that has to hurt.maybe
"Second time in a week, 39 hours total.
The sex, the maylay, the huge orgasms, Kiyone's passionate yodels."
Tenchi sighs, and nods his head as he starts to fall asleep,
Then into the room without any warning, the red-haired scientist starts 
to creep
"Boy you guys sure are noisy, you make such a racket."
She leans down next to Tenchi, "So how many times did you spank it?" 
Ayeka wakes up, a scream is heard, Broka gets it in the face.
"Doing it in the butt with a saiyan!  What a royalty disgrace!"
Everyone begins to wake, except for Broka, who's out like a light.
Ryoko smiles at Tenchi, "Did I put up a good fight?"
Tenchi rolls his eyes to God, he asks, "Why did this happen to me?"
In a booming voice, He replys, "Kid, you're making history."

I had fun writing this, it really was a blast
If you didn't like it, then kick me in my ass
If you want a Chapter 3 to the lemon, please respond ASAP
I'll try to make it as soon as I can, or my name's not Joe "JS Smitty"
