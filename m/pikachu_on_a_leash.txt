Original: Freak on Leash
Artist: KORN

Verse 1
Washu takes a part of me
She does experiments that I can not see
Every time She runs into me
Something's clipped or taken off me, off me
She always tries by seducing
(You wanna poke fight?)
Can't she chill and let me run free
(So do I)
She says that I won't feel pain
(You wanna poke fight?)
As she jabs a needle in my vein, my vein

Chorus
Sometimes I can not escape her place
Sometimes it's her I can not take
Sometimes I can not get away
It always seems to bother me
Then she takes a part of me
Puts it in a tube on display
Wish it didn't have to be this way
Washu takes a part of me

Verse 2
Feeling like a Pikachu on leash
(You wanna poke fight?)
Small little rat never released
(So do I)
How many days have I been teased?
(You wanna poke fight?)
I will never be set free, set free

Repeat Chorus

Bridge

Chorus
Then she takes a part of me
Puts in a tube on display
Wish it didn't have to be this way
Washu takes a part of me
Part of me
