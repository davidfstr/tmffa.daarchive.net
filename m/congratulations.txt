        Gensao is led into an empty room by one of the many authors on his webpage.

Gensao:  What's going on?

        One by one, the cast of a far familiar cast appears.

Tenchi:  It's your archive's birthday!  That's what!

Gensao:  Is this what this is all about?

Ayeka:  That is right!  It is a very special day.

Ryoko:  Yeah!  On this day, two years ago, you made a landmark in Tenchi Muyo!
fan fiction.

Sasami:  It's the biggest day in our lives!  You gave the fan fiction writers
a place to put their work.

Kiyone:  If it wasn't for you, who knows where those stories would be?  Nobody
would see them!

Mihoshi:  I don't know.  After the nasty things that those reviewers said-

        Kiyone clobbers Mihoshi a few dozen times.

Kiyone:  Forget them!  They don't know what they're talking about!

Washu:  There is another thing that happened, you see.  When people found your
archive, some were inspired to write.  It gave them courage to write out their
ideas.

Noboyuki:  And it gave people access to a wide variety of lemons!

        Everyone face faults hard enough to hear.

Noboyuki:  What?

Misaki:  I feel so happy to be in your archive!

        She runs over and gives Gensao her classic bear-hug.

Gensao:  I-can't-breathe-!

        Misaki lets go.

Funaho:  We are all gathered here to show our appreciation for your
outstanding work.

Yosho:  Keep up the good work, Gensao.

Azusa:  Yes, keep up the good work.  We look forward to a third birthday,
Gensao.

-Congratulations, Gensao, on two years of excellence!-
