::Loknar and Washuu sit on a rocking bench, their arms around each other.  
Joseph, Sasami, and the two cabbits are sitting nearby::

::Sasami holds a small, recently-bought bouqet of flowers, which she hands to 
Joseph::

Narrator: Geraniums - 608 Yen.

::Joseph smiles, and hugs her.  He hands two carrots to Ryo-Ohki and Ken-Ohki, 
who eagerly eat them::

Narrator: Carrots - 486 Yen.

::Joseph sets his scifi manga down, and pets them::

Narrator: Scifi Manga - 365 Yen.

::Loknar and Washuu look at each other, wink, and begin to kiss deeply.  Joseph 
turns green, and starts throwing up, over the railing of the porch::

Narrator: Being able to make your son lose his lunch when you kiss your 
girlfriend - Priceless.  For everyone else, there's LoshuuCard.
