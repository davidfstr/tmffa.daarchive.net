One Day
a Tenchi Muyo! Poem 
written by 
Heather McNully aka Sakuya Misaki aka Ran-chan

I see you as a baby
	strapped to your mother's back
   You reach at me with tiny fingers
   I want to reach back,
but my efforts would be in vain
I see you as a child
	running and playing in grassy fields
	cooking sweet potatoes over an open fire
   So close I can almost taste them
   I want so much to help you up when you fall
	but I can't
I see you as a boy
	weeping for your mother
	gone to a better place
   Pounding the earth,
	crying out to God,
believing if you're determined enough, He will return her to    
you
   I want to comfort you,
	to see your smiling face again
   "Everything will be all right," I say, "You'll see... I'm 
  still here... I'll never leave you."
	But my words don't reach your ears
I see you as a man now,
	matured and handsome
   You glance my way,
	your thoughts flooded with childhood memories
   My heart skips, my face burns,
	thinking for a moment, a brief moment, that your smile was 
  for me
but who am I kidding?
  Did you ever reach for me?
	run with me?
	eat with me?
	cry with me?
	smile at me?
Many years have already gone by,
	but one day
   We'll play together,
   I'll be there to protect you,
	comfort, and watch over you,
I'll be with you when you wake, 
with a smile for you,
eager to see your face,
  and you'll smile back at me,
  knowing that I'm there
   "I'll never leave you... 
my Tenchi"
