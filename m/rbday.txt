It's 22nd of August and outside the Masaki residence, all it's inhabitants
are asleep. In the shadow of the house four figures are talking quietly.
<Ty Kalos>(dressed in robes covered with images of Ryoko)" Is that clear ?
The aim of this mission is to give Ryoko one day and night to be alone with
Tenchi in, what they do is not my concern, nor yours. Now repeat your tasks"
<Pat-Ohki>"I am to take Ryo-ohki and Sasami away from the house and keep
them occupied until the morning of the 24th."
<Replicant>"I will take Mihoshi into Washuu's lab and do my utmost to make
sure they don't leave until the day is over"
<Talouran>"A large delivery of sake will be sent to the shrine, and I will
proceed to encourage Yosho and Nobuyuki to get absolutly plastered, and thus
be of no danger to our mission."
<Ty Kalos>"Good, I will trap Aeka with this ward.." (pulls out a piece of
silk about 3 inches wide and 8 inches long, it's cyan hue just visible in
the moonlight, it's golden runes glowing softly) " which due to my belief in
Ryoko will keep her in a blissfull slumber throughout the day"
<Talouran>"BLISSfull slumber ?"
<Ty Kalos>"I tried to make it a feverish sleep but she's too likely to wake
up then, everybody ready ?"
They all nod
<Ty Kalos>"O.K., move out and remember this is for Ryoko"

The figures disperse to prepare for their appointed tasks.

It's early morning, Sasami is just finishing making breakfast. And lunch.
And dinner. This is because he is going on a picnic on Ryo-ohki with
Pat-ohki, She leaves a note saying where she has gone and then leaves the
house to where Ryo-ohki is waiting, with Pat on board. She is teleported up
and Ryo-ohki flies off

In the girls bedroom Ty Kalos is just sneaking ot of the door after placing
the ward on A***'s face. *Good thing Mihoshi is too stupid to try to remove
it* He thinks.

Later on Mihoshi comes downstairs and notices no-one else is around. Then
Replicant steps out of the shadows (shuddering slightly at the evil thing he
must do) and says "May they've all gone into Washuu's lab to see a new
invention". "Oooh, maybe you're right, let's go !", unfortunately she grabs
Replicant's arm and drags him in with her. Washuu suddenly wakes up to
multitude of alarms alerting her to Mihoshi's presence in the lab.

Meanwhile a large van drives up to the Masaki gate and says "Hi, I'm
Talouran, can you help get this up to Masaki Shrine?" And then the guardians
say that famous phrase "Yes, sir !"

It's about 20:00 and orbiting the Earth aboard Ryo-ohki ...
<Pat-Ohki>"Don't worry they'll be fine, you left them enough food to last a
week !"
<Sasami>(worried)"I don't know, it's getting rather late, I still think we
should go back"
Pat goes into panic mode, trying to think of a way to keep Sasami away from
the house

Same time, different dimension, Washuu's lab ....
<Washuu>(in a towering anger and probably causing more explosions than
Mihoshi)"REPLICANT YOU TRAITOR, when I get my hands on you I'll [censored,
but trust me it's a cruel thing] and then spit down the hole "
Replicant has no choice but to run, being chased by Washuu and with Mihoshi
following for lack of anything thing else to break, fiddle with or generally
distract her tiny brain, towatds the exit.

Same time, at Masaki Shrine, the sound of awful singing is interuppted by
Yosho's voice saying ...
<Yosho>(VERY drunkenly)"Why don't we go down to the house and get some of
the really good sake to treat our friend here, Son-in-law ?"
<Nobuyuki>(EVEN more drunkenly)"Yes, why not"
<Talouran>(seeing the plan started to fall apart)"No, really you shouldn't
go to the trouble ... "
<Yosho>"No trouble at all, just wait here"
Talouran starts to shake nervously as the situation slips out of his hands

Same time, the girl's bedroom, and the silk ward starts to smoulder at the
edges and Aeka begins to stir ....

It's the 24th and the sky grows dim as the sun prepares to set, in the ruins
of the Masaki residence there are three groups of people.
The first is the main Tenchi gang, Ryoko and Aeka arguing with each other
and shouting at Mihoshi when she attempts to break it up, Washuu making her
'witty' comments and Tenchi looking resignedly at the whole scene while
Sasami sleeps quietly under his arm.
The second is Yosho and Nobuyuki, both drinking out of sake bottles and
singing out of tune, rhythm, and synch. The resulting sound is so awful
everybody's mind automatically blocks it out.
The third group, out of sight from the others, is our beloved RFFC
commandos, bruised and blackened, and rather dejected,
<Ty Kalos>(wearing male version of Ryoko's OVA 1 costume and playing with a
cyan cube similar to Mihoshi's pink one)" I don't believe it, and just as it
was going so WELL ! "
<Pat-Ohki>"Don't blame me, it's your fault A*** woke up, I could have just
told Sasami that Tenchi was having an early night if Aeka hadn't made such a
scream when she came into Tenchi's room"
<Talouran>(who has managed to escape from Y&N)"Have we found out what
happened in there yet, the spy camera that I borrowed from Nobuyuki
.."(slaps his hands over his mouth)
The others glare at him
<Talouran>(moves his hands away from his mouth)"erm ... was destroyed in the
blast ?"(nervous smile)
<Ty Kalos>"Replicant, give me a hand will you ?"
They proceed to turn Talouran upside down and shake him until all of is
pouches are empty.
<Ty Kalos>"Lets see ... some silver bowls, a piece of expensive looking
jewellery Juraian I believe, a photo of a green-haired woman sunbathing,
what's this writing on the back ... 'Mihoshi, Glad you aren't here, hope we
never meet again, Sincerely Kiyone', and a spy camera, can you explain this
Talouran ?"
<Talouran>"A plan to bring funds to the club ?"
<Ty Kalos>"Hmmm, I deal with you later, Pat, could you call Ryo-ohki over
here for a moment ?"
<Ryo-ohki>(come hopping along)"Miya ?"
<Ty Kalos>"Could you project the images stored on this tape, and DON'T tell
Ryoko"
Ryo-ohki cocks her head for a moment then takes the camera in her paws an
concentrates.
On an ethereal screen the RFFC members watch what happens,
<Ty Kalos>"That's a very interesting costume she wearing"
<Talouran>"Yesss ..."(nosebleeds and faints)
Sometime later and Talouran is half-conscious, Replicant is exerting inhuman
control on his thoughts and Ty Kalos has taken half his body weight in
sexual suppressants. Pat-Ohki no longer human, is eyeing Ryo-Ohki oddly, and
edging towards her.
<Ty Kalos>"I don't believe it, she was this close, a couple more minutes and
Tenchi would have realised his true feelings for her"
<Replicant>"I think we better leave now, if she finds out it was our fault
she failed it'll make Shin RFFC look like something rather minor"
<Ty Kalos>"Agreed, but first I must warn her about what I wrote on A***'s
back"(throws a prepared paper airplane at Ryoko, who catches, reads and then
surreptitiously threw it away, with a slight smirk on her face)
<Talouran>"What did you write ?"
<Ty Kalos>"Tell you when we get back"
The RFFCers go back to our own dimension.

Later on in the baths..
<Ryoko>(in pretended shock)"Why Aeka, I never knew
you felt that way about me"(falls over laughing)

The message was "I love Ryoko", the spy camera film is not available as
Ryo-ohki ate it, and refuses to say why, when asked she merely say "Miya"
