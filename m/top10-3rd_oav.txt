9. Sasami now has her own multimillion dollar cooking show, on the Food
network.

8. Nobuyuki and Kagato are still in employment negotiations, about getting
more air time.

7. Due to eating too many carrots, Ryo-oh-ki now has to see a Reconstructive
Urologist on a regular basis.

6. Kiyone and Mihoshi are scheduled to be in the 2005 remake of the “Dirty
Pair”.

5 Tokimi is still traumatized about not having feet, and won’t come out of
her room.

4. Tenchi moved to Tokyo, went back into the past, married a dying possessed
oak tree, took up directing student films, and is currently raising his
half-demon daughter.

3. Ryoko and Ayeka got tired of fighting, and have taken up chess instead.

2. D3 is not looking forward to his climatic ending scene, where the big
floating head is revealed to just be an illusion, and he is in fact an aging
cabbit, behind a red curtain, with a microphone.

And the number ONE reason why there will be no third OAV series is . . .

1. Cartoon Network is afraid that the new OAVs will not meet up to their
current standards.
