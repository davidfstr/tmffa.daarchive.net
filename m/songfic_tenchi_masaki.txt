 All right.  This is my first attempt to write anything for FF, so please,
be forgiving.  I don¹t want any flames!  I know that this is rather stupid!
 Also, I don¹t own any of these characters except for Connie or this song,
so please don¹t sue me!  I¹m a High School student!  I don¹t have any cash!

Tenchi Masaki
(to the music of Bree Sharp¹s ³David Duchovny²)

 Ryouko walks into the room looking highly annoyed.  She sits down in one of
the chairs.  She¹s sitting in a waiting room and it looks like she is being
forced to do something that she doesn¹t want to do.  A tall, blonde,
teen-looking girl by the name of Connie walks into the room.  She has the
stern face of a mother.  She stands in front of Ryouko.
 ³All right, Ryouko.  I want you to sing this.  You and I both know that you
like to sing, but if you don¹t sing it, I¹ll just change a few words and ask
Princess Aeka to sing it.  And she already wants to...²
 ³Fine!  I¹ll sing the damn song!²
 Ryouko takes the sheet of paper with the words on it that Connie held out.
 Connie led Ryouko into the recording studio and shows her to the mic.
 Connie returns out the door and into the control room.  The music starts...
 Ryouko is cued and misses her entrance by three bars.
 ³Ryouko!  Aren¹t you paying attention?  Come in in the right place!²
 ³Sorry, I wasn¹t paying attention.²
 ³Obviously.  Now pay attention or I¹ll get Aeka.²
 ³All right, all right...²
 The music starts...

It¹s late at night, I am curled up in his room
The bright moon light fills my heart like a balloon
I hold in in, but I still fall
I just wish to hear his call
But I¹ll just, instead, float right through another wall
And I can¹t...

Wait anymore for him to discover me
I¹ve got it bad for Tenchi Masaki
Tenchi Masaki, why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?

Aeka tells me
ŒBakeono, he loves me¹
But deep within his eyes
I see something she can¹t see
Watching him all the time
The Prince of Jurai is on my mind
I¹m waiting for the day
When my lucky stars align
In the form of...

Tenchi Masaki running towards me
On the prettiest day in Okiyama, I need
Tenchi Masaki and Ryo-oki
The handsomest man in all of Japan
Tenchi Masaki, why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?

So kawai and smart
Yes, he¹s stolen my heart
And I¹m falling apart
ŒCause he¹s taking so long
I have to sing this damn song
Until the day that he sees
That he truly love me

Now I¹m smashed, I will take another drink
It¹s gotten hard to just sit down, relax, and think
My cheeks have gotten rather red
As I put a hand to my head
And I look and see him hiding underneath his bed
Then I say...

Tenchi Masaki, why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Tenchi Masaki, why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Tenchi Masaki, I want you to love me
To kiss and to hug me
If not just to love me
Tenchi Masaki, I know that you love me
I¹m sweet and I¹m charming
Goodbye Ojyo-sama
Tenchi Masaki, why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?
Why won¹t you love me?

I¹ll be waiting...
On the roof...

 ³Okay, Ryouko.  That was good.  That¹s a wrap.²
