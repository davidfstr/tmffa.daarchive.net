        Since she started living on this planet, Sasami has been collecting
books from the stores.  There are several different kinds of books she
collected.  Manga, cookbooks, novels, and many more.

        The most useful are her cookbooks.  Although she's a great cook, she is
always trying to expand her menu.  One such book had an interesting
chapter, which was the reason she bought it.  This chapter isn't
completely new to her, but likewise hasn't been tested.
        Setting the hard-backed book on the counter, she goes to work.  She
then pulls out various ingredients for the recipes.

        Ryo-Ohki looks at the book, curious.  "Meow!"

Later

        Tenchi is studying in his room when he smells the aroma.  While it's in
no way foreign to him, he just hasn't smelt it in the house before.
Walking out of his room, he heads for the source.

=-=-=-=-=
        Ryoko is resting in the rafters when she smells something interesting.
"Could it be?  Is it-"  Dropping the sentance, she floats into the
kitchen.

=-=-=-=-=
        Ayeka is relaxing in the living room when the aroma strikes her.  "What
is that?  It smells so good.  It smells so different."

=-=-=-=-=
        Walking over to the lab door, Sasami opens it a hair.  Washu, floating
on her cushion, doesn't even notice.  After all, Sasami was careful
enough to not disturb the crab (the one above!).

        Washu smells the same aroma.  "I haven't had any of that in a long
time."  Hopping off the pillow, she walks out the door, not even
noticing it unsealed.

=-=-=-=-=
        Mihoshi is sleeping in one of the chairs of the living room when an
appetizing aroma shoots her awake.  "Oh boy!  It's-"  But, her sentance
is interupted as she trips and collides with the floor.  Getting up, she
walks to the kitchen.

=-=-=-=-=
        Misa is in her room when that same aroma moves into the room.
"Sasami's finally trying those recipes."  Moving towards the door, Riko
and Ryo follow her.

=-=-=-=-=
        Kiyone has just walked into the house when she smells an enticing
aroma.  "Could it be?  I haven't had any in awhile."

=-=-=-=-=
        As everyone gathers in the kitchen, they all see the same thing.
Arranged on several trays are rows and rows of

        "CHOCOLATE!" they all scream, with a "miya!" from Ryo.

        "Sasami?" Ayeka asks, "I didn't know you could cook desserts."

        "I never got the chance until now."  Holding up her book, "this was a
big help."

        Tenchi looks at the cover:  "CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE?"

        "Oh, wow!" Mihoshi exclaims.  "They look great!"

        Ryoko is examining the assortment.  "Truffles, turtles, fudge, and
brownies!"

        Washu is also examining the array.  "And even chocolate covered
pretzels!"

        Ryo sees something that immediately gets her attention.  "MIYA!"
Translation:  "Chocolate covered carrots!"

        "Had fun, didn't you?" Misa asks.

        "You bet!"  Stepping out of the way, she lets in the group.

=-=-=-=-=
        Later, Ryoko and Ayeka stop fighting completely, Mihoshi recovers her
intelligence, much to the pleasure of Kiyone, and Sasami and Tenchi live
happily ever after.

        Washu gives up on being a mad scientist, and all is finally right with
the home.

        Forget cheese.  Behold the power of CHOCOLATE!
