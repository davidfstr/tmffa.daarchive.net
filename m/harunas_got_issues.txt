Song: Haruna’s Got Issues
By: The Unknown DJ
Pre-read by: Cav

Original: She’s got issues
Artist: the Offspring

Verse 1
I was seeing Haruna and she gave me a very hard time
She grabbed me in the forest right before I could
speak mind
She said that she really loved me and cared every
little bit
But She got pissed when I drew Ryoko, which in turned
she ripped
And I say

Chorus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Haruna’s got issues and I have to pay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She’s playing the Psycho, yeah!

Verse 2
Now I know she’ll feel abandoned if we don’t screw
every night
And I know she’s afraid to admit that starts all of
our fights
And I say

Chorus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Haruna’s got issues and I have to pay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She’s playing the Psycho, and she’s also a tree
I’d say you’re messed up and Cav thinks you’re a dirty
whore
Just leave me alone and wait till TMiL 4

Verse 3
Now she changes things non-stop, but I don’t mind
But when she gets rid of Aeka that’s where I draw the
line
You told me a hundred times how Grandpa left and he’s
gone
But I wish you wouldn’t call me Yosho when we’re
getting it on
And I say

Chorus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Haruna’s got issues and I have to pay
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
She’s playing the Psycho, and she’s also a tree
I’d say you’re messed up and Cav thinks you’re a dirty
whore
Just leave me alone and wait till TMiL 4
