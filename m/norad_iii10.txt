<JS>  Hello again, and welcome to Norad III, the MSTing Battlecruiser.  As 
always, I do not own these characters, except for myself, and of course I don't 
own any characters in the MSTed fic.  Megaman X  belongs to Capcom, Washu Hibiki 
belongs to Pioneer, Meis Triumph belongs to Atlus and Red Company, Samus Aran 
belongs to Nintendo, and Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company and 
Warhammer 40K belongs to Games Workshop.  With that said, on to the descriptions 
of our heros, and then to the MST.
Also, my spellcheck is busted, so there may be a few mistakes.  You will also 
have to read my last MSTs to get some of the jokes in this one.

NEVER FORGET 9-11-01

These are the tales of the crew of the Terran Battlecruiser Norad III.  They 
were trapped there by Dr. Wily, who forces them to read bad fanfiction.

<JS>  And, just to give you an idea of what we look like, here are some 
descriptions.

JS:  Formerly a bald human seventeen-year-old, but was recently changed by Washu 
to have one attribute from each MST crew member.  He now has an arm cannon 
called the J-Buster, a blue sword called the J-Saber, a helmet with ocular 
sensors in it, acid spit, and he didn't want anything from Meis.

Megaman X:  Last robot created by Dr. Light before his death.  Leads the 
Maverick Hunters fourth unit, as Captain.  Can interchange armor parts, and use 
a variety of weapons.  Wearing the Force Armor, a white, cool-looking armor. It 
allows him to hover in midair, take lots of damage, and use a special Giga 
Attack.


Samus Aran:  A bounty hunter from deep into the galaxy, her family was killed in 
a space pirate attack.  Wears a special suit of Power Armor that was built by 
the Chozo, or Bird-People. This version of the armor is the Varia suit.  Armed 
with an array of different energy beams, that can charge up to become more 
powerful.  Has optical sensors built into helmet for better sight in the dark.  
Hates all perverts, especially Meis.

Washu Habuki:  One of three Goddesses:  Herself, Tokimi, and Tsunami.  Self-
proclaimed "Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe", and nobody except maybe 
Yume has the brains to contest that title.  Wears her old Science Acadamy 
clothes, and is armed with her Holoputer.  She is 20,000+ years old.  Also has a 
small forcefield generator, because of a certain pervert's continued insults 
toward a certain purple-haired princess.  Has her hair inside a hat, so that it 
doesn't catch on fire in case anyone decides to use fire weapons.

Meis Triumph:  Possibly the luckiest guy in the world.  He has twelve beautiful 
women all falling for him, and he isn't afraid to date them all!  Wears a cloak, 
white pants, and a brown shirt.  Has his trusty W-Blade at his side, and also 
can call upon many powerful beasts of magic to aid him. (For example, if Samus 
was trying to kill him again, he would summon Aquoon, the water dragon.) 
Probably the biggest pervert in the world, and proud of it.  Has a high 
threshold for pain, possibly because of the constant beatings he gets from the 
other MSTers.



Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company:  From the year 40,000, is 
second-in-command of one of the most powerful Space Marine Chapters in the 
galaxy, the Ultramarines. They are one of humanity's greatest achievements.  He 
is eight feet tall, wears a suit of Terminator Armor.(Very large, bulky suit of 
all-enclosing mechanical armor, increases senses and reaction time one-hundred-
fold.)  Armed with a Storm Bolter(Huge double-barreled gun with detonate-on-
contact ammunition) and a glowing blue Power Sword.(four foot long blade, with a 
matter-disrupting field around it, basically allows him to cleave through 
anything) Has three hearts, four lungs, can spit acid, see in the dark, hear a 
pin drop from a thousand paces, run at speeds of up to thirty miles per hour, 
and is about the most loyal person to the Emperor of Humanity you can find.  
Also wearing an Iron Halo, which gives him a powerful forcefield.

--------Inside Norad III's dining room--------
<JS> (Eating steak) Hey, guys.  I have some bad news.  It seems we made an enemy 
in our travels.  And unfortunately, he's one of the reasons I was chosen to 
start MSTing.
<Washu> (Eating rice balls) Who, Peter?  Ksa?  Joe?
<JS>  No, no, no.  Nobody like them.  I'm talking about Jim Ohki.

<Meis> (Having some grilled Chocobo) Geez, you must've done something REALLY bad 
to get on his bad side.  Mmmm, tastes just like chicken!
<Invictus> (Eating a rock) Yeah, what did you do? *CRUNCHCRUNCHCRUNCH*
<X> (Recharging energy meter) Wait, you mean the guy married to Mihsohi?
<Invictus>  O__O!  Married to Mihoshi?  EVIL!
<JS>  Now now, let's not get him any angrier than he already is.
<Samus> (Noshing on an apple) I didn't think he would take the Mihoshi jokes 
that personally.
<JS>  And what I don't like is he dissed the ship!  This is a damn nice ship!
--------Incoming transmission--------
<Wily>  HE INSULTED MY SHIP?!  HOW DARE HE!
<JS>  ^__^;  Calm down, you're gonna have a coronary!
<Wily>  I'll show him!  I'm gonna make this the biggest, baddest battlecruiser 
the universe has ever seen!
<Washu>  Except for Tsunami.
<Wily>  No, better!
<Washu>  But that's impossible!
<Wily>  Nothing is impossible when you have the power of the author on your 
side!  MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! 
--------End transmission--------
<X> ^__^; I have a reeeeeally bad feeling about this.
<JS> Yeah, me too.  Maybe I shouldn't have said anything about the ship comment.
<Washu>  Gee, ya think?
<JS>  Maybe if we ignore him, he'll go away.
<Samus>  I don't think so.  Look at the line below me.
--------Incoming transmission-------
<Samus>  See?
<Wily>  Oh, before I get to work, I have an MST for you to do.  It seems that 
this fic was sent to me on purpose, indicating the person WANTS it to be MSTed.
<All> O__O!
<JS>  Is this guy crazy or something?
<Invictus>  He must be a masochist.
<Meis>  ^__^  Just like me!
<Samus>  T__T* You had better shut up, Meis.
<Washu>  Now now, I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of 
this.
<JS>  Hmmmm.........nope, none that I can think of.
<Wily>  Well, GET IN THERE!
<All>  YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL!
--------All enter the theater--------
<JS>  So, Washu, what's this one called?
<Washu>  I think it's called "Tides of Destruction, Tides of Vengeance". 
<Invictus>  Well, that doesn't sound too bad.
<Washu>  I hope you're right.

First off, let me say that this is my first fic

<Meis>  That's never good.

written meant to be posted on any site.  

<Meis>  Oh.

I will do my
best to keep all the characters IC, and will strive to
make the story a good one, while attempting to keep
continuity straight.  

<JS>  This might not be so bad after all.

Please note that I have only
seen the TV versions of Tenchi and TMiL, 

<X>  I never knew there was a TV version of Tenchi Muyo in Love.
<JS>  Neither did I.

that's it (I
will however, be avoiding "Shin Tenchi" like the
plague), 

<JS>  Hey, this guy's pretty smart!

so I have not seen the OAV's, so there may be
some rather large continuity violations, sorry in
advance for these, I do not do them knowingly.  

<JS>  Yes folks, that was ONE sentence.  From "Please note" to "knowingly".

Since
this is my first, please be rather hard with your
MST's. 

<Invictus>  It's official, this guy's a sado-masochist.
<Meis>  ^__^  Just like me! *BAM*
<Samus>  U__U*  We don't need to hear about your personal life.

So without further banter by me, I give you my
first Tenchi FanFic.

Standard DisclaimerJ
        Tenchi, and all characters made under that series are
property of Pioneer and AIC, 

<All>  Yadda yadda.

I am only borrowing them,
and plan to give them back when I'm finished.  

<JS>  I'm sure they won't be too happy about that.

I know
neither of those companies will sue me for writing
this, 

<Invictus> (Pioneer lawyer)  MWAHAHAHAHAHA!!  I've decided to sue Evan Ulven for 
all he's worth!  AHAHAHAHAHA!  What?  He's only worth five bucks?  Dammit!

unless I make money off it, and I won't.

Warnings:
        It is possible that a bit of Lemon may appear later
on in this fic, 

<Meis> (Homer Simpson)  Mmmmm......lemony fresh.

I will try to avoid all-out sex, 

<All but Meis>  GOOD!
<Meis>  Goddammit!
<Washu>  ^__^  Meis, if you don't stop swearing, I'm going to shove THIS(Pulls 
out a large spiky ball) up your ass!
<JS> (Gasps) WASHU!  You went against your own rule!
<Washu>  Oh? (Looks at what she just said) OOPS!  Silly me.

and
hope, that at the worst it is strong Lime.  

<Meis>  I LOVE lemon-lime soda!


I don't
know, since I am making this up as I go.

<JS>  Well, that's not right!

        I may take some names from other Anime shows/movies,
I'm none too good at Japanese, 

<Meis>  Aloha!
<Samus>  That's Hawaiian, you retard.

and I don't want a


stupid sounding name ruining my fic, so I'll be taking
just names, not the characters.

<X>  In other words, he's gonna use characters from other animes, but erase 
every bit of the original info about them.

        Also, this is an AU/SI 


<Meis>  He's an Australian?
<Samus>  That means it's an author self-insertion, you fool.
<Meis> ;__; Why are you always pickin' on me?!

of sorts, though the character
based on me is hardly god-like and is perfectly
capable of being killed off by yours truly, 
<JS>  Hey, this might be a good fic after all.

he will
not be the main character, and is only there for some
flavor.  

<Invictus>  Chocolate or Rocky Road?

As for the AU part, this takes place about 15
years after the end of the series.



SHINJI AND ASUKA FOREVER!!!
.....woah, where'd THAT come from.

<Washu> (Sarcastically) I wonder if he's an EVA fan?

[][][][][][][][]][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]^_^

<All>  O__O;
<JS>  What the hell are THOSE?
<Washu>  According to my readings, they are square sweatdrops.
<X>  Wow, I didn't know you could do that.
<Washu>  Neither did I.

Tides Of Destruction, Tides Of Vengeance
Written By: max_sterling83@yahoo.com

<X>  We already know the title, get on with the fic!

        Funaho, Empress of Jurai, watched the vid-screen
intently with a bemused look on her face, in her mind
feelings of amusement and pride swelled in her as she
watched the primitive technological dance before her.

<JS> (Does that Home Alone thing where he slaps his hands to the sides of his 
face) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!  Right off the bat he makes a run-on sentence!

She had only found out about this recently, and, ever
since, had watched with great interest as it played
out.  


<JS> (Chess tournament announcer 1) And we're back with the final game of this 
chess tourney, it's very exciting.  We're in the eighteenth hour, and this is a 
very important move.  Yes, it's the first move, and we think he will move a pawn 
out.
<Invictus> (Chess Tournament announcer 2) This is too exciting.  Oh, it seems we 
have a special guest.  It's Funaho, from the royal family of Jurai!  I didn't 
know she lliked chess.
<JS> (Chess tournament announcer 1) You learn something new everyday, don't you?

She was not the only one watching, many other
races had learned of what was happening in the
protected area, and was also taking a great interest,
also, the Galaxy Police were taking up defensive
positions around the entry vectors of the Sol system
to prevent any outside interference.

<JS> (Grabbing head, in pain) OH GOD, the run-ons!
<Meis>  Wow, I didn't think any other alien races cared about earth.

        The cause of all this attention and protection was a
large, primitive (at least by others standards)
spacecraft that was approaching the fourth planet in
the Sol system, a colony ship moving towards Mars,
carrying over 200 civilians, scientists, and military
personnel, was about to land, and in doing so, begin
the construction of Earths first extra-planetary
colony.

<JS>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!!!!(Faints)
<Washu>  geez, the run-ons got to him already!
<Invictus>  Shush!  This may reveal what happened during the dark age of 
technology!
<Washu> (Whispering to X) What is he talking about?
<X> (Whispering to Washu) I think Invictus has gone a little crazy. *BLAM*
<Invictus>  I can't believe you forgot already that I can hear you clearly a 
mile away!
<X>  (Burnt)  Ouch.
<Invictus>  Anyways, the Dark Age of technology was when mankind had gone to the 
stars and colonized thousands of planets.  Then, all of a sudden, transportation 
between all the planets was cut off and many of the planets regressed to more 
primitive states.  Then blah blah blah, blah blah, blah.  Yackity smackity, 
yadda yadda.
<Washu>  Why are you making all those sound effects?
<Invictus>  To symbolize that I'm rambling on, and on, and on, and on, and on, 
and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and *BLAMBLAMTHUDPOWWHUMPSMACKWHAM* OW!



        Funaho watched as the large ship made planetfall, 

<Washu>  And crashed, killing everyone on board.
<Invictus> (Singed and fuming) DON'T INSULT MY ANCESTORS!
<Washu>  ^__^;  Okay, okay!

and
hundreds of Terrans left the ship for the first time
in two years.  

<Invictus>  Thus, the legions of the Adeptus Mechanicus were born.
<Washu>  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!
<Invictus> (Calmly hands her a three-foot-wide book entitled, "The History of 
the Imperium") Read that, and you'll understand.

Funaho couldn't contain her smile as a
dream of the entire Terran race came to fruition.
Even though she had lived on Jurai for over 700 years,
Funaho still retained a strong link with her ancestral

home, 


<JS>  Oh yeah, I forgot Funaho was born on Earth.
<All but JS> (Jump away) GAH!  When did you wake up?!
<JS> ^__^ About five seconds ago.

and was very well known for the vehemence in
which she protected it.  She would fight in the


Juraian council endlessly to keep the planet Earth as
inviolate as possible, and had, on more than one
occasion, stopped one royal house or another from
exploiting Earth as an economic resource.  

<Washu>  I wouldn't want to use Earth as an economic resource, it's all sludge 
and trash there.

She had an
easier time of keeping her adoptive people in check in
regards to Earth with the help of her sister-empress
Misaki.  

<X>  Hey, he spelled it correctly!  Most people spell it "Masaki", but he knows 
the right way!

On several occasions, they had joined
together to stop raiders or other military powers from
making Sol as base of operations, 

<JS>  Oh no, the Shampooitis has spread to this person, too.

and had been
instrumental in making the GP the only organization
with any say on who got to Earth and who didn't.  

<JS>  In other words, they created the MiB.

"The
Terran Race has the right to make its own path without
the un-needed interference of other races, the same
right all races have." 


<Invictus> (Smugly)  Well put.  And look what they created in the thirtieth 
millenium.
<Meis>  What?
<Invictus>  The first Space Marines of the Adeptus Astartes, and later, ME!!
<Meis>  ^__^ O-kay.

Was just one of her many things
that she said to make her point.
        And now, she watched with open pride as her people
took their first tentative steps into space.  

<JS>  And then they promptly suffocated and died, because they apparently 
weren't wearing space suits.

It would
only be a matter of time now until Earth became more
capable in space travel, and diplomatic teams would be
sent from both Jurai and the GP to welcome Earth into
the fold of space-faring races.  

<Invictus>  Interesting.  So THAT'S how we got the technology for warp-travel.

Until then, Funaho
would remain vigilant. 

<JS>  Brothers, remain vigilant!
<Samus>  What are you talking about?
<JS>  Play the game Chaos Gate and you'll understand.

A high pitched, but level voice
called to her from behind.

<Washu>  AGH!  It's Misaki!  HIDE!


"Funaho, are you there?"
"Yes, Misaki, I'm at my console."
        Soft steps are heard as Misaki, walks over to the
door.
"We have another message from Sasami." 

<Invictus> (Sasami's message) Hello!  Well, Mihoshi's luck finally ran out when 
she crashed for the five-thousandth time and broke her hip.  Other than that, 
everyone's been doing fine!

Said Misaki.
Funaho smiled, happy to hear from her niece "Great!
Its been what, 6 months now since her last one?"
"Seven actually, the last one was about her being
pregnant."

<All but Washu>  O__O!  NOOOOOOOOOOOO!  STUPID AUTHOR!
<Washu>  If you had actually been paying ATTENTION to the beginning of the fic, 
he said this was fifteen years after the series ended.
<All but Washu>  Oh.


"Well, lets see this one now, I miss her, and these
messages make it easier."
"Allright."

<Washu>  I think there's supposed to be a space in "all right".
<JS>  Okay guys, be prepared for a BIIIIIG author's comment.

*Authors Note:  A little back-story here.  This fic
takes place after a story I wrote that I never was
able to post, 

<Meis>  Well, maybe you should have tried posting it BEFORE posting this one!

as that story goes, 10 years after the
series ends, Ayeka and Sasami are called back to
Jurai, Ayeka goes with a tearful goodbye to Tenchi and
Ryoko, who were married a time earlier.

<JS>  The run-ons, the horrible, horrible, run-ons.

(Ayeka stayed
as a close family friend, and a kind of third parent
to Tenchi's and Ryoko's daughter, Kira.) 

<Washu>  And so begins the non-Tenchi Muyo anime names.

Sasami,
however doesn't want to go as she is in love with a
Terran by the name of Alex Kernskey, 

<Invictus>  AKA the SI.


a US Marine
stationed in Japan (NOT the SI character) 

<Invictus>  Oh.

whom she met
while shopping with Ryoko and Tenchi (She spends years
on Earth, you think shes going to vegetate in the
house constantly). 

<X>  Shouldn't that be a question?



Ayeka takes the situation to her
mother, and Misaki relents to letting Sasami stay on
Earth, but not after meeting the Terran in question.
Sasami merges with Tsunami, and shortly after THAT,
marries Alex.  

<Samus>  I think we ALL know what daddy's reaction will be.

Azusa becomes furious 

<Samus> Yep, I knew it.

at another Terran
being brought into the Juraian Royal Bloodline, comes
damn near to declaring war on Earth, but stops when he
is informed that the only way he could take and keep
Earth would be through ground based combat, 

<Washu>  Or he could just blow the whole planet to smithereens, but I guess the 
author didn't think of that.

and it is
pointed out that while the Juraian Knights are good,
fighting cornered US Marines on their own turf would
be VERY expensive, 

<Meis>  Yeah, ten thousand gold pieces a pop!

so he settles down.  

<JS>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH! (Faints again)
<Washu>  I'd better record this.  Hmmm, I think I'll call it, "Run-onophobia".

After that
story, Earth begins colonization efforts, and Sasami
becomes pregnant with her first child. Thus bringing
us to this fic.

<X>  Well, that explains everything.

*End Authors Note

<Meis>  Wow, that was pretty long for a note.


        Misaki walks over to the console, open a small port
and inserts a small crystal into it, moments later a
holographic picture of Sasami appears, she is
obviously pregnant, her blue hair is pulled back into
a single shoulder-length ponytail, while she is older
than the last time she set foot on Jurai, she still
has a youthful air about her, and her eyes still gleam
with a touch of childlike mischief. 

<JS> (Waking up) So, what'd I miss? (Reads the last sentence) AAAAAAAAAAUGH!!
(Faints again)
<Washu> ^__^;  He just can't get a break, can he?

Then the Hologram
recording began to speak.
 " Hello mother, hello 

<Invictus>--Father, here I am at, Camp--*BAM*
<Samus> (Retracting fist) U__U*  I HATE that song.

Aunt Funaho, Its been a while

since I talked to you last, sorry, I've been a bit
busy."
As Sasami says that she has a smile on her face, and
raised one hand to the bulge above her waist.

<Samus>  Well, where else would it be?  Her elbow?

"Anyway, I thought now would be a good time to send a
message, especially with what's going on with Mars and
all, I guess the Terrans will be making the Galactic
scene sometime in the next fifty years or so."  

<JS> Th-th-the ru-ru-ru-ru-run-ons.......
Washu>  Calm down, JS, there're sparks coming out of your ears.


"Its
been rather exciting here, celebrations all over the
world for several reasons."  "I never really noticed
how much can happen in 7 months." 

<X>  The fic Sasami seems to be a bit slow on the uptake, methinks.

"First, the Mars
colony, which is all that is talked about here now,
then the creation of the United Earth Alliance."

<Meis> I do believe this is turning into a Starcraft ripoff.
<JS> That's United Earth DIRECTORATE, you fool!

"That is one of the big reasons I wanted to call.  The
Terrans have finally made a unified planetary
government, so all the resources on this planet are at
its disposal.'  "The talk of overpopulation has come
up again, and with good reason, with 12 billion people

on this world now, its getting pretty cramped, they're
even rationing food and water in some nations." 

<JS>  I don't th-think I can take mu-much more of th-th-this...

"So
the UEA has decided that the only way for Earth to
remain habitable is to colonize other worlds."
"Already larger, hyperspace-capable ships are in
production, and already worlds around Alpha Centauri,
Vega, and Essex 

<JS>--County.

sectors are slated to be colonized in
the next 5 years."  "This will undoubtedly put them in
contact with other races, and Terra isn't ready for
that yet, I don't know what can be done, but something
need to be."

<JS> I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I *THWACK* Th-thanks Washu.  I really don't un-understand 
how someone c-can make so many r-r-run-on sentences in ONE fic.


        "Well, onto less stressful things, I'm due in another
3 months, I don't know if it's a boy or a girl, Alex
and I want that to be a surprise, but were leaning
towards the names
being Shinji for it's a boy, or Miriya if it's a
girl."  

<JS>  GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH-GAH!!!!!
<Washu>  I need a sedative, here! (Invictus pulls out a horse tranquilizer)
<Invictus>  HERE!
<Washu>  Thanks! (Injects JS, who promptly falls unconcious)
<Meis>  And some more anime names to add to the list.

"Well, that's all I really have time to say,
Alex and I are working on a nursery, give Ayeka my
love, love you, and I hope you decide to come when the
baby is born, Bye."

<Samus>  If JS was awake right now, his head would probably explode.



        And with that the holographic display flickered and
powered down.
Misaki sat with tears in her eyes, still looking at
where the hologram had been.

"Ooh, My little Sasami is going to be a mother."

<Meis>  Let's hope she doesn't turn into you. (Misaki appears)
<Misaki> '__'*** WHAT DID YOU SAY?! (Starts pulling and pinching Meis's face)
<Meis> OWIE OWIE OW OW! (Washu holds up a sign behind Misaki, and Meis reads it 
out loud)
<Misaki>  Really?  Oh, you're so sweet! (Disappears)
<Meis>  Well, that was painful and unsatisfying.  Can we do it again?!

Funaho then spoke.
"I hope we have time to get to Earth when its time for
the baby to be born"
"As do I, I wonder though..."
"What?"
"Will Azusa accept her child as a part of the royal
lineage, or will he view Sasami's  child as he does
Tenchi and his family?"

<Washu>  Y'know, I've always wondered if Azusa could use the Light Hawk wings.


        Funaho considered this, it was something she never
really gave thought to.
"I certainly hope he accepts them, he really has no
reason to deny any of them...

<X>  So, is Sasami going to have more than one child?

But if he does, Sasami will
raise him as a normal Terran, and probably not even
think about the throne, she never has wanted it
anyway."

<Invictus>  I don't think this person knows how to use a period properly.


WHEW!!!
Sorry if this was rather boring, the stroy 

<Samus>  What the hell is a "stroy"?

is just
getting started, so please, bear with me on this.
End of Part one, I wanted to make this a giant
one-shot, but I really want to get this posted, AND, I
want it MST'd, I know, I'm asking for an MST.  

<Invictus>  He sure does like his whips and chains.

But
hey, these are for entertainment, and I want to know
if I'm any good, and I want to know any glaring
mistakes I made, MST's are the best way.

<JS> (Waking up)  Yeah, you definitely have a shortage of periods.

        Just to let you know Alex Kernskey is NOT repeat NOT
the SI character, that one probably won't be showing

up for a while.

<Invictus>  I think we got the point that he wasn't an SI before.

        This story is (I hope) one in a long series, and I
again hope to have one installment every 3 weeks.

<Washu>  Yet there are only two chapters.

        So, MST away, especially Bryan Weber, Peter Suziki,

<JS>  I think Peter would be insulted if he saw his name misspelled like that.


and the Author of "Causality", and I certainly cant
forget Ksawarrior or the crew of the JERDI, I love you
work and would be honored if you did mine.

<Wily>  GRRRRR!  He didn't mention my ship!
<JS>  Yeah, how's the construction going?
<Wily>  Well, I've greatly increased the size of the ship.  It is now one-fourth 
the size of the moon.
<All>  O__O;
<Wily>  Well?  I said I would make it bigger, and I meant it!



"Hello, and Goodbye, as always"


<Washu>  Whatever the hell that means.

<Meis>  But what happened to the other eighty-three Max--*BLAMBLAMBLAM*
<Invictus>  You're starting to get on MY nerves now, and believe me, you don't 
want that.

Lemon

<JS>  The one word that ruins everything.

Earth is advancing into danger, a family is growing, and two women are caught in 
the middle. (Lemon/Lime later)


<Meis> (Drooling)  Please tell me that means two women are gonna go at it! 
*POWSMACKTHUDWHAMTHWACKWHUDBAMBAMBAM* OUCH.


Well, I think Part One went well, 

<JS>  Oh, it did, except for the HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE RUN-ONS.

but I would still like plenty of C&C on it, as well as on this part.  I would 
REALLY like to see an MST of my work, just to see if it is received well by 
readers.  Thanks in advance: Evan "Paladin" Ulven

Standard Disclaimer(
	Tenchi, and all characters made under that series are property of Pioneer 
and AIC, I am only borrowing them, and plan to give them back when I'm finished.  
I know neither of those companies will sue me for writing this, unless I make 
money off it, and I won't.  So no need to worry, 

<Meis>  Isn't that a chapter in one of the Tenchi lemons I've read?
<Washu>  Ugh, disgusting!
<Meis>  Yeah, I never knew you could do that many different styles, Washu.
<Washu>  WHY YOU LITTLE BASTARD!  C'MERE!
<Meis> (Running away) Ah, I just LOVE it when beautiful women chase after me!

just read and enjoy!

Warnings:
	It is possible that a bit of Lemon may appear later on in this fic, I will 
try to avoid all-out sex, and hope, that at the worst it is strong Lime.  

<JS>  GOOD!
<Meis> (Running away)  Dammit!


I don't know, since I am making this up as I go.
	I may take some names from other Anime shows/movies, I'm none too good at 
Japanese, and I don't want a stupid sounding name ruining my fic, so I'll be 
taking just names, not the characters.
	Also, this is an AU/SI of sorts, though the character based on me is 
hardly god-like and is perfectly capable of being killed off by yours truly, he 
will not be the main character, and is only there for some flavor.  As for the 
AU part, this takes place about 15 years after the end of the series. 

<X>  Yadda yadda.  You already said that.
<Washu>  AHA!  I've got you now!
<Meis>  HELP!


SHINJI AND ASUKA FOREVER!!!
.....woah, where'd THAT come from.  I'm also an Eva fan, but I don't have enough 
money to get all the DVD'S yet.
[][][][][][][][]][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]^_^

<Washu>  AAARGH!  It's the physically impossible square sweatdrops again!
<Meis> (Thinking) Now's my chance! (Squirms out of Washu's grasp)
<Washu>  HEY!  COME BACK HERE!

Time For Destruction, Time For Vengeance

<Invictus>  Part deux.

*A few advance notes here.  The timeline I had worked out for this fic was very 
rapid, so I'm going to try and drag it out a bit 

<JS>  So, in other words, he's gonna make us stay here a lot longer than 
planned.

to make the story flow better.  At the beginning of this part, it has been 1 
year since the end of Part one. (Sorry! But this space is needed to make the fic 
read right)
*End advance notes

<Washu>  I'll get you later, Meis.
<Meis>  I'll be waiting.

	Sasami watched with a contented look on her face as she observed her 
husband playing with their two children.  

<JS>  WHOA, where'd we go?!
<X>  In the last fic, she was seven months pregnant.  Now they have the kids at 
home?  Wait a second, TWO kids?!
<Washu>  X, your cicuits are overloading.  Calm down.

With the birth of Shinji and Miriya, their lives had changed drastically, 

<JS>  As soon as the kids were born, everything went straight to hell.

first, Sasami had to deal with two children instead of one, she still remembered 
the look of shock, love and pride on her husbands face when they found out they 
were having twins.  

<Samus>  I'd be surprised too, if I had more kids than I thought I would.

The fact that neither of them wanted to look at any of the ultrasound scans had 
made it so the gender of the child would be a complete surprise, but neither of 
them had expected twins, let alone a son, AND a daughter, making them use both 
of the name they had agreed on for their progeny.

<JS> (Robotic voice) MA-MA-MAV-MAV-ki-ki-killkillkillkillKILLKILLKILLKILL!!!!!! 
(Grabs Meis and starts mauling him)
<Meis>  Help me!
<Invictus>  Looks like the run-ons finally drove JS over the edge.
<Meis>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!!!!  HEEEELP!
<JS> (Cackling maniacally) KILLKILLKILLKILLKILL!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!



	Both Shinji and Miriya were walking now, well, waddling anyway, 

<Washu>  Like a penguin.
<X>  Where'd that come from?
<Washu>  The MST author.
<Meis>  OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!
<Invictus>  Should I?
<Washu>  Be my guest.
<Invictus>  Okay! Inferno Bolter SHOT! (Blasts an incendiary bullet at the 
insane JS and the maimed Meis)
<JS>  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-Huh?! (Catches on fire) 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!
<Meis> (Also on fire) PUT ME OUT!!  IT BURNS!!!
<X>  Oh, all right. (Runs into the two burning people) FROST TOWER!!! (Turns 
himself and the two flaming bodies into ice cubes)
<Invictus> ^__^; Well, I'd say that they'll thaw in a few paragraphs.

it was absolutely adorable to watch them scamper to their fathers open arms as 
he came home from a conference meeting with USMC command.
"DADA, DADA!" spoke the two toddlers as the both of them made a beeline from 
their toys to the front door of the house.

<Zero> (Runs in)  I'M ALLERGIC TO BEES! (Runs out)
<All>  ^__^;  O-kay....


"Hey! How's my little angels?" "Were you both good today?"
	Sasami out down the carving knife

<X>  How can you "out down" something?

she was using to chop vegetables, wiped her hands on a towel, and walked into 
the entryway.
She had a loving smile as she spoke. "They were absolutely perfect" 

<Meis>  Yes, they tasted like beef!
<Samus, Invictus, and Washu> Why you disgusting little piece of ****!  YOU WILL 
DIEEEEE!!! *BLAMKICKPOWWHUMPTHWACKBLAMBLAMCHOFCHOFCHOFCHOFCHOFSHEENFOOMKABOOM*
<Meis> (Pile of mush) Ouch.  Maybe I should've kept my mouth shut.
<Samus, Invictus, and Washu> You think?  And why did you thaw before the others?
<Meis> (Pile of mush) I guess I'm just special that way.

"Neither one of them made a fuss all day."
	Alex put down the children then embraced his wife and gave her a small 
kiss.

<All> (Make smacking noises)

"That's great to hear." "So, how was your day?"

<JS> (Thawed, as Alex)  Pretty bad, actually.  First, I fell in a big bucket of 
KFC chicken, and a roaming pack of wolverines mistook me for lunch.  Then, I 
slipped into a sleeping bear's den, and got mauled.  After that, I fell down 
fifty flights of stairs, and landed in a swimming pool that was filled with 
someone's piranhas.  Other than that, it was just another bright, sunny day.

"Pretty good, actually.  

<JS>  What did I just say?!

I asked Tenchi and Ryoko if they could watch the kids so I could get a few 
things done in town, and I managed to get a few things that we needed."
"Sorry I missed them, I've been meaning to ask Ryoko a few things."
	Sasami got a questioning look on her face.

<Washu>  Like what?


"Like what?"

<Washu>  Boy, was that ever predictable.


"Mainly to know if there are any non-legit groups on or near Earth that might 
cause some problems."
"Why not ask me?"
"I didn't think you would know about pirates, outlaws and other people that need 
to be avoided."

<Washu>  Only my daughter is the expert on that!


"That makes sense, Ryoko would be the one to ask about that.  

<All>  Duuuuh......

All I can say is that GP and Juraian Patrols routinely go through the area just 
beyond mars orbit to look for illegal transgressors." 

<Meis>  Oooooo, big word!

"Ever since the Mars colony became operational, the patrols have probably moved 
their range to either inside or just beyond the asteroid belt."
"Why so far out?"
	Sasami smiled at her husband.

<Washu> To avoid detection, of course.

"To avoid detection, of course."



<JS>  Washu, stop reading ahead!

	Alex winced, then looked at Sasami with a sorrowful gaze.
"Alex, whats wrong?"
"We need to talk. Now."
	Sasami detected the urgency in her husbands' voice, and moved toward the 
children.
"Time for a nap you two."

<X> (Thawed) Okay! (Shuts down)
<Washu>  Oh no, you're not getting out of this THAT easily! (Presses X's power 
button)
<X>  Rats.

	She then took Shinji and Miriya to their room, and tucked them in for 
their afternoon nap.
	Alex took a deep breath, then, after a brief pause, began to speak.
"That meeting I was at with USMC command.  

<Meis>  And what, pray tell, does that stand for?
<Invictus>  Well, since you're from a primitive time, you wouldn't understand.
<Meis>  HEY!  I resent that remark!

Well, its wasn't just the command staff, the joint chiefs were there as well as 
the Presidential advisors for biological containment."
	Sasami looked extremely confused.
"What? Why?"

<All>  Why should we know?!

	Alex took another deep breath.
"Well, when we were at the hospital for the kids birth, 

<JS>  There should be an apostraphe there.

the med-staff followed standard procedures.  Before they could give you any 
painkillers they had to know if you were allergic to any of them, or if the kids 
were,so they took a blood sample to look for any negative reaction to he 
Epidural."

<Washu>  Uh-oh.
<All but Washu>  What's "uh-oh"?
<Washu>  Look! (points a few lines down, everyone reads them)
<All>  Uh-oh.

	Sasami's face went pale; she knew where this was heading.
"Well, as they scanned the sample, the doctors noticed some bacterium that they 
had never seen before, as well as some foreign vitamins, minerals and other 
biological chemicals."  

<All>  Uh-oh.

"Then they did a blood type test, to determine your blood type, and the sample 
showed the type wasn't even on record.  

<All>  Uh-oh.

So they followed up with a DNA scan, and found more chemicals that just don't 
appear in any other Terrans DNA structure."

<All>  BIG uh-oh!

	Sasami was even paler now.  Her next sentence was spoken nervously.
"Does that mean..." She trailed off.
	Alex looked her directly in the eyes.
"Yes, Sasami, they know that you are not of this world."

<JS>  Well, the cat's out of the bag!
<X> (Ranma)  C-C-C-CAT!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!
	
Sasami suddenly felt almost sick, 

<Samus> (Sasami)  Ugh, I don't feel so good.....

the thing she was to keep secret from the people of this world was out.  The 
Terrans knew there was an alien and two hybrid children living on their planet, 
and even worse, the most powerful military force were the only ones who had that 
information.
	Sasami's voice was low and stuttering when she spoke next.

<JS>  (Sasami) O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-no!

"What...What else do they know?"
	Alex sighed and looked somewhat ashamed.
"Everything Sasami, everything you told me, I told them everything.  

<Invictus> (Smashes fist into the seat in front of him, utterly annihilating it) 
He is a traitor!  He must DIE!
<All but Invictus> ^__^;  C-calm down, Invictus!
<Invictus> (Doing that arm-pump thing) I will not!  I will stop the traitor!
<Washu> (Pulls out an armor-piercing needle, and injects Invictus with it)
<Invictus>  HOW DARE Youuuuuu....(Falls unconcious)
<JS>  What the hell did you just give him?!
<Washu>  ^__^  My newest tranquilizer, able to take an Extellan Arthrigor down!
<JS>  Oh.  How long will he be out for?
<Washu>  It should metabolize out of his system in about five minutes.
<JS>  O__O! Holy crap, that's a fast metabolism!

I had to, if command found out I was lying under oath in a military inquiry, I 
could be either to 25 years in Leavenworth, or be shot in a firing squad.  

<Samus>  He should be shot...in the face.

And I didn't want you to go through life as a widow."
	Deep inside her mind, Sasami felt a brief flare of anger, but it was 
quickly suppressed, she couldn't blame Alex for giving that information, under 
the pressure of a Marine inquiry, even her sister would have probably broken. 

<Washu>  Who would clean up the pieces?

 And even Sasami knew just how unforgiving and uncaring Earths military was, the 
Marines more that most.
	"So what happens now?" She asked.
	"Well, there are several things."
	"One, stay here and act as if nothings happened, which I don't recommend, 
since as I left the inquiry I heard mumblings of 'capture' and 'study'."

<JS>  And I heard mumblings of 'pillage' and 'destruction' about the USMC.

	"Two, go hide out with Tenchi and Ryoko."

<Samus>  Which is probably the choice they'll pick.

The next sentence Alex spoke was rather nervous.
	"Or three...Go the Jurai."

<JS>  I hope he meant go TO Jurai.

Sasami gasped at the last option, going to Jurai would put Alex in even more 
danger that she was in here.  Sure she could be 'captured' and 'studied'.  

<JS>  PILLAGE!  DESTRUCTION!

But at Jurai, Alex could very well be killed for marrying her without the 
consent of her father, 

<X>  I never knew Azusa was THAT harsh.

let alone raising a family.  Her mother and aunt had fully backed the wedding, 
but her father had remained unmoved but any of their protests, and would still 
not consent even after meeting Alex.  

<Washu> (Azusa, to Alex) You're not Juraian!  So I don't like you!

Even after he was accepted by Tsunami to drink the life water of her tree, thus 
making him as unaging as Sasami, her father would still not consent to the 
'Primitive Savage' marrying her.  

<Meis, JS, Invictus, and Samus>  HOW DARE HE CALL US PRIMITIVE SAVAGES!!!

And now her beloved was talking of going directly to the place where he would 
probably be imprisoned and executed, just to ensure the safety of her and the 
children.  

<Washu>  Geez, I guess Azusa's an idiot if he thinks that killing someone's 
father would leave them better off.

Sasami now had tears in her eyes as she spoke.
"How could we do that?" she cried.
"You'd be killed almost as soon as you touched the planet surface, 

<Meis> (Pretends he's Alex, about to step onto Jurai)*Step* *BLAM!* And thus, I 
die!  GACK!

what were you saying earlier of not wanting me to be a widow?" 
	Alex winced at that comment, and Sasami immediately knew what she had said 
had hit home, and she felt a pang of guilt for having said it.

<JS>  R-r-right n-now I th-think I'll rest f-for a minute. (Removes his helmet 
and punches himself in the face, knocking himself unconcious)
<All but JS>  ^__^;

	"I'm sorry Alex, I didn't mean to say that."
	"Its all right Sasami, what you said was true, I guess we'll have to think 
of something else."
	"Well" She mused. "We COULD go to Tenchi and Ryoko, perhaps Washu could 
help out somehow."

<Washu>  All I would do is erase the humans' memories of Sasami!  That's it!  
And any computer data, too.

	"Your right that would work!"  

<Washu>  I'm always right.

"But... I don't want to put Tenchi and the others in danger.  I'm willing to bet 
I've had a spotter on me ever since I left the base, 

<Invictus>  AKA sniper.

and we really don't want to lead my superiors to the others do we?"
	Sasami pondered this for a few seconds, then her eyes brightened as she 
hit upon an idea.

<Meis>  But she's married already!

	"Alex, I just noticed that I've never shown you the bridge of Tsunami, 
have I?"

<All but JS>  Wha-wha-whaaaat?!
<Washu>  That's funny, I've never heard of such a thing.

	"No, you haven't, but what does this have to do with anything?"
	"I can have Tsunami teleport us to the ship, then send us directly to 
Tenchi and Ryoko's house, and the spotters 

<Invictus>  Snipers.
<Samus>  STOP THAT!

wont even know we'd have left."
	Alex had a stunned and amused look to his face now, much better that the 
nervous, worried look he had earlier.
	"Sasami, you're a genius!"  

<Washu>  No, I'M a genius!

He leaned forward and gave her a deep kiss.  "That plan is brilliant!"  "But 
what will we do then?"
	Sasami smiled brightly.
	"One step at a time, my love."

<X>  Y'know, those square sweatdrops look a lot like the "remaining battery" 
thingie on a cell phone.

Being teleported, Alex, thought was one of the strangest sensations he had ever 
felt.  It sort of felt like his entire body had been carbonated, 

<Meis>  So, now he's soda?

a strange tingling feeling that started at his feet and worked its way up to his 
head.  It wasn't a bad sensation, just...unusual.
"That...felt rather weird."
Sasami looked at him strangely.
"Wha...oh, I forgot. First time for teleportation?"

<Washu>  So, how many times, exactly, has Sasami teleported using this "Bridge 
of Tsunami"?

"Yeah, rather interesting feeling isn't it?"
"I guess, I've done it so much that I never notice it anymore."  "How are the 
kids?"
Words were not needed as the laughter coming from the two 1 year olds 

<X>  Oh, so THAT'S how old they are.
<JS> (Waking up, holding his forehead) Oh, what happened?  I have a splitting 
headache!
<Washu>  You punched your own lights out, JS.
<JS>  What, did I go crazy again?
<Washu>  You could say that.

as they tried to chase each other around their father's legs clearly showed that 
they were more than fine.
Alex smiled warmly at the children. 
"Pretty good I guess."
	Sasami gave off a small silvery 

<Meis>  MONEY!

peal of laughter as the two children suddenly locked onto their father's legs as 
he stared walking, 

<Samus>  He was staring at someone walking?

making him carry them along as he walked.
"Well" She said "Lets get that cal to Ryoko."

<JS> (Sasami) Yeah, we have to mail out this Ripkin guy as soon as possible.

Alex had a slightly worried expression on his face.
"Are you sure that the message cant be intercepted?"

<JS>  He's starting to run out of apostraphes.

Sasami just gave him a serious look.
"By the technology on this planet, no."
Sasami then typed in where she wanted the subspace call to be sent, and moments 
later, a small hologram of Ryoko appeared, beginning the real-time holo-
communication.
<X>  Oooooo, another big word!

Ryoko had obviously mellowed some from before the time she had married Tenchi, 
before, she would always wear extremely revealing clothes of wild, bright 
colors.  

<Washu>  Not true!  She usually wore that green and blue dress!  Well, at home 
anyway.

But now, she was wearing plain khaki day slacks, and a tight-fitting white top.

<Meis>  Drooooool......

  The look gave a more mature, professional, and motherly look than before.  But 
Ryoko still had that mischievous, fun-loving glint to her eyes that only she was 
capable of, a kind of wide wonderlusted look, that, combined with a look of 
contrived innocence, seem to capture the attention of everyone that beheld her 
perfect form. 

<JS>  I-I-I-I-I-I th-think I'm gonna g-g-go give th-this author a le-lesson in 
h-how to m-m-m-make a sentence. (Walks out of the theater)
<Invictus>  Wait, we're in outer space right now, correct?
<Washu>  Yeah, so?
<Invictus>  And the only way out of the ship is through an airlock, right?
<Washu> (Thinks for a second)  OmiGod!  JS, get back here! (Runs off to stop JS)

*Authors Note:
As you can probably see, I'm a big Ryoko fan, I'm no AHRLI, 
but I am a great fan.  

<Meis>  Good, because the ventilation in this room is horrendous!
<X> O__o Wow, Meis, you used a big word.  Maybe you're not such a dumbass after 
all.
<Meis> ^__^ I like boobies!
<X> =__=* I take that back.

But my favorite Tenchi character is still Kioyne, 

<Kiyone> (through a hidden speaker) GODDAMMIT THAT'S NOT HOW MY NAME IS SPELLED!

and she will be making an appearance later on, along with everyone's favorite 
blonde airhead

<Invictus> '__'*** KILL IT!

*End Authors note

"Sasami!" Ryoko said wit ha 

<X>  What the hell does "wit ha" mean?

note of surprise "Its been a long time since you called last, what's going on?"
"Well, Ryoko..."
"Wait." Ryoko interrupted, "Hold on a moment"
"Tenchi!" Ryoko called off to the side "Pick up, its Sasami!"
"What?! Sasami! Ill be right there!" came the reply from off-projector.
A few moments later, Tenchi appears on the Holonet.

<All but Washu and JS, who are out of the theater> WAZZUP!

The last few years have been kind to Tenchi. His final growth spurt, just before 
he turned 18, made him about as tall as Ryoko, he had put on more muscle, and 
the years of martial arts training and working hard in the carrot fields had 
toned his body. 

<Samus>  Droooool.....
<Meis> (Looks at Samus funny)
<Samus> (Notices Meis) WHAT?!  I like Tenchi!

Years of constantly working hard had tightly wrapped his muscles, so while he 
was noticeably bigger, he still had a agile, athletic build to him, and that, 
combined with a slightly bronze cast to his skin color from being in the sun 
almost constantly, made him look particularly appealing to the female eye.  

<JS> (Walks in, and sees the last sentence) GAH GAH GAH GAH GAH GAH GAH!!!! 
(Runs out) 
<Washu>  Aw crap, I just got a hold of him! (Chases after him)

He had obviously been working in the fields in the heat of the June afternoon as 
he was still stripped to the waist, was still slightly dusted with dirt and only 
wore a pair of stained and slightly torn khaki work shorts.

<Meis>  I think this person likes khakis.

Tenchi had a large smile on his face as he began to talk.
"Sasami, Alex, its been too long, how are you?"  He greeted them warmly. "Please 
forgive my appearance, I wanted to get here as soon as I could."
"You wont be getting any protests from me, Tenchi" Ryoko called seductively.

<Invictus> Well, there's ONE person in character here.  Well, I guess Tenchi is, 
too.

Sasami and Alex laughed together.
"Haha, Ryoko, you will never change, will you" Said Alex.

<X>  I'll have to take JS's place for now.  "He said without any punctuation".

"I don't plan to"
"I certainly hope she doesn't" Tenchi stated, "I like her as she is"
Ryoko then, still smiling, looked back to Sasami.
"So what's up?"
"Ryoko" Sasami sighed sadly "I wish I could say this is was a social call to 
catch up on old times"

<X> He seems to have plenty of quotation marks, but not many other punctuations.

Ryoko's and Tenchi's expression suddenly turn serious.  
"What's wrong?" They both speak simultaneously.
Sasami took a deep breath before speaking.

<All> *HUUUUP*

"Let me tell you"
Sasami then went on to tell Tenchi and Ryoko of what had happen at the base in 
Okinawa, the data gathered by the doctors at the hospital, the military inquiry, 
what would have happened to Alex if he hadn't told all the story, and what she 
and Alex had planned to do.

<X>  At least he didn't repeat it all.

By the end of Sasami's statements, both Ryoko and Tenchi had worried and shocked 
expressions.
"I cant believe the US is willing to go this far." 

<Invictus>  Whoa whoa whoa, wasn't it called the UMSC?

Tenchi said "What are they thinking?"
"Only of their own advancement" Stated Alex "That's all they care about"

<Invictus>  True, true.  We have no reasons to let Xenos live.
<Meis>  But you're fine with Washu, right?
<Invictus>  She at least LOOKS human.

Ryoko then spoke up.
"But if they did anything to Sasami it would start an instellar war!  The 
Terrans would be rolled over and either enslaved, extinct, or quarantined!"

<Invictus>  Obviously, it wasn't because I'm here standing before you.

"Out of pride I must say that the first two, probably wouldn't happen."  Said 
Alex.
Ryoko thought on that a moment. 
"Okay, Ill give you that one, it would be impossible to keep Earth in line 
without ground troops, 

<Washu> (Walks in, dragging an unconcious and severly damaged JS) Or they could 
just mind-wipe all the humans and be done with it, but I guess they would rather 
make them slaves.
<Samus> What the hell happened to JS?
<Washu>  The idiot decided to pick a fight with Duff McWhalen again!  The damn 
fool nearly got himself killed!
<Meis>  Then what's that in his hand?
<Washu>  Oh, one of Duff's flippers.
<All but JS and Washu>  O__O!  WHAAAAT?!
<Washu>  Well, I never said he actually LOST to Duff....

and Marines are probably the best damn infantry I'VE ever seen, 

<Invictus>  Yes, I'll have to agree with her on that one.  We Marines ARE the 
best infantry units in the galaxy.
<X>  I think he meant HUMAN Marines.
<Invictus>  Oh.

that deterrent worked before against Jurai, but, hopefully it wont come to 
that." 
"So you want Washu to help?" asked Tenchi.
"Yes" Stated Sasami, "I think she's the only one who can"

<Washu>  I can make the impossible possible!

A smile appeared on Ryoko's face again.  "Well come ahead then, nothing on this 
world could track where you teleport down."
Sasami and Alex's face brightened.

<Meis>  Like a lightbulb!

"Thank you."
"No problem" said Ryoko "And I can guarantee you that it will take more that a 
squad of Terran troops to get past me and Tenchi."
<JS> (Waking up)  This sounds like Starcraft.  Ouch, my head hurts.  Hell, my 
whole BODY hurts!

End Part 2

<All>  YAAAAAY!

WOOOOHOOOOO!

<JS> (Playing air guitar) A WOOHOO NANANANANANANANA NANA!

I finally finished part2!
Is it any good?

<Washu>  It actually WAS pretty good.

 I hope so.  I tried to make it longer and more interesting that Part one.
If you notice, parts one and two develop different storylines, this is done 
intentionally, they will be brought together soon.

<JS>  I'm gonna stay in control.  STAY IN CONTROL!

Well, I hope you liked it, send me C&C at   HYPERLINK

SOMEONE PLEASE MST THIS THING!!!!!

<All>  WE JUST DID!
<JS>  And it was pretty painful for me!

That's the best way to see if my fic is any good (in my view anyway)

<Meis>  You have a twisted way of viewing things, then.

Just to reiterate Alex is NOT the SI, 

<Invictus>  YOU ALREADY SAID THAT THREE TIMES, DAMMIT!

he is a character pulled from my imagination.  

<Samus>  Um, Evan?  That's what an SI is.  A person from your imagination.  Or a 
real person.

Thought I must say that I like the sound of the name "Sasami Kernskey"

<X>  Yeah, that does sound pretty funny.
 
Part3 coming soon

<JS>  Yet it never came.

"Hello, and goodbye, as always."

--------All exit the theater--------

<JS>  Review time!
<Washu>  I liked it, but he had some trouble with spelling near the end.
<X>  It was good.
<Meis>  Except there was no sex!  He lied!  BOO!
<Invictus>  He might be able to reveal to me what happened during the Dark Age 
of Technology!  Keep writing!
<Samus>  I really liked that.
<JS> And as for me, that was wonderful! Bravo! I loved that!  Oh, it was great! 
Well, it was pretty good.  It wasn't bad!  Well, there were parts of it that 
weren't very good though.  Yeah, it could've been a lot better.  I didn't really 
like it.  It It was pretty terrible!  It was BAD!  It was AWFUL!  GET HIM AWAY!  
BOO!  But seriously, this author has something here.  All he needs to do is cut 
down on the r-r-r-r-run-on s-sentences and h-he's a-a-all set!
<Washu>  Now, who wants to play me in Trivial Pursuit?
<Invictus>  Why bother?  You already know all the answers.
<Washu> (Pouting)  You're no fun.

The End.

<JS>  JS here.  I'd like to say that, although this guy is a little weird for 
ASKING for an MST(Hell, I did that once!) he is a good story writer. (To author)  
You might want to check your sentences over, though.  There were some sentences 
that could have counted as an entire paragraph in there!  Other than that, you 
have a good plot, and I would like to see more. (End "to author") So, anyways, 
soon I'll have a team MST up, where me and Joe JS "Smitty" Smith(Yeah, I know 
we'll have a tough time with the JS part) team up to tackle some bad fics, 
including a new one by an author named *shudder*  "Kagato's Testacle".  I 
haven't read any of his fics yet, but I'm guessing from the author's name that 
they're bad.  JS out.
