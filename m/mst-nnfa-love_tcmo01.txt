MSTer's note:Since we are MSTing a Tenchi fic and the Tenchi cast are
MSTingThe  example ::name::
sign are the MST characters. The Fic will be "'ed.Thank you.

In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki,who is a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
He threw his curlers in a purse, and pursued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!!
Ryoko: mmmmmmmmm ice cream
Washu: AHHH brain freeze, damn I hate that telepathy sometimes!
Ayeka: LEATHER!
Mihoshi: I R BIMBO!

Repeat to yourself it's just a fic and you really should relax,
For Tenchi Muyo theater 4000

(once again on the space ship known as Ryo-Okkie)
:Ayeka walks in with big beady eyes and frantically moving her eyes around:
<Ayeka> :drool coming from mouth: gggooooooooo awwwwwwww ooooooooow
:Ryoko on the couch looks up from her issue of space studs unlimited: swim suit 
issue:
<Ryoko> looks like princess snobby has found the new cappuccino machine
<Ayeka> :shaking violently: whats cappuccino?! :continues babbling words too 
fast for any one to make out:
<Ryoko> well princess it's a beauty potion, and by what I can tell you seem to 
be a little more beautiful then usual
<Ayeka> AWWWW now I have the upper hand on your, you mummy women. all I must do 
now is consume more to insure that lord Tenchi will chose me over you. now if 
you excuse me I must go make some more
:Ryoko starts giggling insanely as Ayeka leaves the room
:as Ayeka leaves she passes Washu:
<Ayeka>heywashuhowareyou?iamfinethankyou,ifyoudon'tmind,i'llbeonmywaynow.bye
:Washu stopped dead in her tracks to try and consume all the hasty information:
<Washu>what in the name of the 4th dimension did you steal from my lab Ryoko!
<Ryoko>W-H-A-A-A-A-A-T?! I didn't do anything
<Washu>then how do you explain the princess's condition?
<Ryoko>she some how managed to find the new cappuccino machine
<Washu>that'll do it every time
:Ryoko starts thinking about the encounter she has with Ayeka again and resumes 
her tremendous laughter:
:hearing all this commotion Tenchi entered the room:
<Washu> hey Tenchi....
<Tenchi>hello little Washu
:Washu blushes at the tone of voice Tenchi used to say her name that time:
<Ryoko> :in the middle of her laughter catches the little of Tenchi's voice like 
a police dog would catch the faintest smell of drugs: TEEEEENNNCHI!
:Ryoko regains her composer in lightning like speed and zips over behind Tenchi 
to give him the usual groping:
<Tenchi> RYYOKO!
<Ryoko> awwwww my Tenchi, how good it is to feel your pee-pretty face :sweat 
drop appears on her forehead:
<Washu> 'in Ryoko's head' nice save
:Ryoko grins at Washu:
<Tenchi> I wish you guys would quit thinking I am so clueless all the time
:both of them blush this time:
<Washu> well speaking of that, Tenchi I just got my nurses outfit dry cleaned, 
wanna stop by the lab later on and lemme conduct some experiments?! :Washu says 
it with a big grin on her face:
<Ryoko>back off "mom"
<Washu> 'says in ryoko's head' now wait "daughter" what if I had you do the work 
for me as like an undercover spy type of thing
:Ryoko's eyes go big and gleemy with delight from what her mother said
<Washu> thought you'd like that idea
:Tenchi smacks his own forehead and signs:
<Tenchi> Ryoko I haven't seen Ayeka so what did you do to her this time?
<Ryoko> AWW MAN, lock a jurian princess in the closet after giving her spanish 
fly and stripping her of her clothes for 30 times and people just start pointing 
fingers
<Washu> she is getting cappuccino from the new machine 
<Tenchi>oh hey, a new one, great!
:Ayeka stumbles back into the room, so hyped up on caffeine that it makes me her 
movements slow:
<Ayeka> oh lord Tenchi there you are, how do I look?
<Tenchi>umm is that a trick question Ayeka?
:slumps over to Tenchi and puts both hands on each of his shoulders and draws 
her face to his:
<Tenchi>WHOAAAA
:Tenchi jumps back from the unexpected look at Ayeka eyes, all blood shot and 
veiney:
:Ryoko bursts into laughter again:
<Ayeka>what Tenchi? don't I look more beautiful from the beauty potion?
<Tenchi & Washu>Beauty potion??? :they both automatically look at Ryoko:
:by now the new dose of cappuccino has kicked in and Ayeka starts running around 
in circles and start trying to climb up the walls:
<Tenchi>RYYYYYYYYYYOKO!!!!!!!
:Ryoko desperately try's to contain herself from watching in amusement at 
ayeka's behavior:
:right when Tenchi was gearing up to give Ryoko a tongue lashing (be decent 
about that one readers, lol, I barely could, even though she wouldn't mind 
{^_~}) a hologram screen came about:
<Washu> oh well look who it is, still wanna do unspeakable things to me dr.clay?
<Dr.Clay>grrrrr you little twerp, but your pay back shall be a bad fic with your 
daughter as the target, MWUHAHAHA
<Ryoko> well gee golly who would target me :looks smug at Dr. Clay:
<Dr.Clay>HUH?
:as he looks past the group behind them to find ayeka with swirls in her eyes 
@_@ and a huge grin on her face moving like that fast effect from the matrix, 
just flailing her arms wildley in the air:
<Ryoko>holy smokes, look at her go, almost like that time in the closet
:every one stars at ryoko:
<Ryoko>wha-a-t?
<Dr.clay> well you cretonnes, fic time, and by the way, enjoy ryoko, MWUAHAHAHA
:Screen disappears:
<Washu> I better lock ayeka up to let her sleep off that caffeine
<ryoko> well that only makes two, we need a third
<Washu> I got that covered too
<Ryoko> oh god no, no  one likes to take their moms to the movies with them, 
especially when they are on DATES, mother!
<Washu> but this is the first when the guy has two women to worry about :as she 
winks at Tenchi:
<Tenchi> :a emotion of helplessness sweeps endlessly across tenchi's 
face....practically pitiful pouts more or less and says: lord any time you wanna 
take me would be good!
<Ryoko> you ain't getting out of it this time :grabs the back of tenchi's collar 
as he try's to flee from his nightmare:
:::::FIC SIGN:::::::
<Ryoko & Washu> this might be funner then usual
::they both grab a hand full of shirt over each shoulder and drag Tenchi into 
the theater while Tenchi sobs like a 4 year old::
<Tenchi> I DONT WANNA!

No Need for a Love to Call my Own
CHAPTER 1 - YURI ATTACK!
By: Myo Myo

::Ryoko::I am rusty with my Japanese but Yuri sounds so familiar.....hmmm...OH 
YEAH, ITS CUZ PERVE AUTHORS CAN'T SEEM TO NOT ASSOCIATE ME WITH THEM

AT THE MASAKI HOME...

    "DAMN YOU! WHY DON'T CHU GO AND SUCK WALNUTS PRINCESS PUSSY!!" Ryoko
shouted at Ayeka in a mad fit.

::Ryoko::umm o.k did this author even watch the show? that is not something I 
would say, and besides ayeka doesn't have one any <ryoko stopped right there to 
see the other staring at her with jaws dropped and all>

    "WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO TO HELL!!" Ayeka shouted back, turning red with
anger.

    "I'VE BEEN THERE THANK YOU!!" Ryoko shouted once more before Tenchi
jumped in.

::Tenchi::(in Barry whites voice) hey now ladies their plenty of Tenchi-ken to 
go around

    "Girls, girls please!" Tenchi tried to calm them down when a loud crash
could be heard not far from his home. They all gasped.

::Ryoko::oopps one of my land mines for ayeka went off, sorry

    "What was that?" Sasami asked while looking out the window with Mihoshi
by her side. Mihoshi was busy chewing on her fingernails and wailing.

::Washu::while Sasami was busy trying to get a look at the bulge in Mihoshi's 
pants
::Ryoko::ooooooooooooooooooooook

    "I-I'm scared!! M-maybe it was a-a monster f-from the p-planet of Bacon
Man!!" 

::Ryoko:: yeah along side the jimmy dean sausage planet, in the pork galaxy

Mihoshi cried as everyone stopped to stare at her with sweat drops.

    "Maybe it was just another one of Washu's inventions gone bad...." Ryoko
said under her breath.

::Washu::NEVER!, I am the greatest scientific genius in the universe, besides 
it's never my faults its the, I R BIMBO's fault

    "Noooooo! I'm right here my wonderful, precious, loveable, adorable,
daughter of mine!!" Washu said as she grabbed Ryoko's head and squeezed it.
Ryoko was turning purple from loss of oxygen.

::Washu::thats so outta character for me, I would never call ryoko lovable
::Ryoko::thanks mom
::Washu::anytime wonderful, precious, adorable daughter of mine, HAHA

IN OTHER PLACES....

    A dark figure rose from the ashes of the crash and stood staring at the
timid Masaki Household not too far from where it was standing. A cloak
covered it's body showing hints of it's muscles which seemed to emit a
strong feeling of fear onto onlookers who dared challenge it's power. The
figure was then joined by a white creature with red eyes.

    *PING!* "MREEEEOOOWWWW" Ryo-Ohki hissed and got into her fighting
position as she realized who was here.

::Ryoko::Jerry Seinfeld?
::Tenchi:: Jerry Springer?
::Washu:: Jerry Stiller?
::Ryoko:: probably not but their all just as annoying

    "Ryo-Ohki, what's wrong?" Sasami asked looking scared. Ryoko noticed her
cabbits actions. <Oh no.... it... can't... be> Ryoko thought horridly as she
looked out the window. Ryoko new it couldn't be true.

::Washu:: yeah she knew Tenchi couldn't be in love with her, hehe
::Ryoko:: <starting to grind her teeth together> now why would you say a thing 
like that mother??

    "Stay here. I'll go check it out" Ryoko ordered.

    "But Ryoko-" Tenchi started.

::Tenchi:: you forgot your diafram
::Ryoko:: <Punches Tenchi in the arm>
::Tenchi:: OUUUWWWW
::Ryoko:: That'll learn ya won't it?

    "I said I'll go!" She yelled at him. Tenchi nodded slowly and backed
away. <Why are you here.... What have I got that you want..> Ryoko thought.

::Washu::You got funnions! gotta love dem funnions

    Ryoko phased through the door. She flew until the smoke from the crash
was clearly seen. It seemed like the crash site was deserted. But almost as
if she was expecting it, she jumped quickly to dodge a flying flash of
light.

::Ryoko::LOOK OUT, it's Luke Sky Whacker!
::Washu:: <Can't helps but to giggle at the remark>

    Ryoko had gasped at that and turned in time to greet her rival with
crimson eyes that were full of hatred. Ryoko growled a low growl and stood
in fighting position, staring down her arch nemesis, Nagi. They stood
staring at one another for what seemed like hours until Nagi spoke.

    "Well, well, well, the Space Pirate Ryoko. How are we this lovely day?
Have you laid Tenchi yet? Or has he run from you again?" Nagi said huskily
with an evil grin.

::Ryoko:: well I don't see you having much luck either Nagi!
::Tenchi::with the name of this fic being "Yuri attack" I think we'll know why 
she hasn't tried much

    "That's none of goddamn business bitch! I know you want something...
SPIT IT OUT ALREADY!!"

    "Me? Hmph. What makes you think I want something?"

    Ryoko was getting curious as to why she hadn't tried to attack her yet.
<What are you planning to do Nagi? I know your gonna try something....>
Ryoko thought cautiously to her self. Nagi just grinned and held her hand
out. Ken-Ohki jumped into her palm.

    Nagi threw Ken-Ohki up to the sky. "We're going on a little trip
Ryoko..." Nagi said with a sly smile that made Ryoko shiver with fear.

::Ryoko::me scared? no way, it was cold that day, couldn't you see the tiny 
lumps on my shirt author?

    Ayeka looked out and saw Ken-Ohki hovering over the crash site.

    "Oh no! It's Nagi!! Tenchi what are we gonna do?" Ayeka asked Tenchi,
who was already trying to think of something. Mihoshi and Sasami were
scared. Tenchi had to go after Ryoko in pursue of Nagi.

    Nagi whooshed toward Ryoko and bashed her across the face. Ryoko flew
back crashing hard into an Oak tree. Nagi then lunged her knee into Ryoko's
stomach hard.

    "AHHHHHHH!!!" Ryoko managed to choke out before she lost her breath and
collapsed onto the ground. The last thing Ryoko saw was the crimson eyes
that stared deeply into hers. She passed out.

::Tenchi:: <gets a big grin> I have seen enough fics to know where this is going
::Ryoko:: <Shakes her head back and forth from side to side> apparently it 
didn't learn ya
::Ryoko:: maybe this'll do it <brings her fist back and WHAM! into Tenchi arm 
again
::Tenchi:: damn girl talk about tough love

    Tenchi burst through a thicket of bushes as he unleashed his sword. He
shined his anger that spread wickedly across his face.

    "LEAVE HER ALONE NAGI!" Tenchi shouted as Nagi just picked up the
unconscious Ryoko.

::Tenchi:: I prefer my piece of meat not tenderized!
::Ryoko:: <got a warm feeling from the idea of Tenchi being dominant>

    "Don't waste your energy boy. Ryoko was mine from the beginning."

    "I said put her doooooown!!!!" And with that Tenchi sped forward and
lashed his sword. Nagi easily subsided the attack. But she felt a slight
sting on her arm. She looked down and saw her cloak had been torn along with
her flesh as well. Nagi's eyes burned with an evil Tenchi has never seen.

    "BOY, HOW DARE YOU TRY ME UP! YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE
TRYING ME! IT'S GO TIME!"

::Washu:: let's get ready to RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUMBLE!

    Nagi teleported Ryoko up onto her ship. She whipped her sword out to
engage in a battle with Tenchi. He stood ready. Nagi rammed onward and so
did Tenchi. It was a head to head battle between the two.

    *CLING*

    *CLANG*

    *CHING*

    *SHAM*

::Tenchi:: wow author such a visual you painted in our mind with that elaborate 
description!

    The duel continued as Nagi and Tenchi battled it out. Nagi swiftly
counter attacked a slash from Tenchi an stabbed his shoulder, then pulled
her sword from there and gashed it across his knee.

    "YAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"

    Ayeka jumped. Sasami and Mihoshi both looked at Ayeka's trembling hands.
Neither said a word, but looked out at the crash site. Washu noticed the
scream and noted that it was indeed Tenchi.

::Washu:: yeah he is the only one that really sounds like a girl when he screams
::Tenchi::well little WASHU!, I'm taking off 10 brownie points for that one
::Washu:: I'll earn them back if you come to my lab after the fic
::Tenchi:: <GULP> 
    
Ayeka, summon Azaka and Kamadake and go find Lord Tenchi, I'll go into
my lab and see if I can find out what's going on and why Nagi's come!! 

::Tenchi:: Nagi cummed? I bet it's blue too
::Ryoko:: YEAH-H-H FREAK! 

And
Sasami, Mihoshi, you two can help me!" Washu ordered them. They all nodded.
Sasami and Mihoshi jumped up and disappeared into Washu's lab along with
Washu.

::Washu:: ONCE AGAIN! with the title being "Yuri Attack" that action alone 
doesn't seem good

   "WE MUST SEE TO IT THAT LORD TENCHI IS OK! AZAKA, KAMADAKE! TAKE ME TO
LORD TENCHI AT ONCE!!"

::Tenchi:: <throws popcorn at the screen> yeah ride that long honey, like the 
nasty cow girl you are
::Ryoko:: men never learn, I'd hit ya again but my arm cramped from the other 
beatings

    "YES PRINCESS!!" They appeared quickly and placed a thin bubble around
her and headed out the door.

    Nagi stood over Tenchi's hurdled, bleeding form and grinned an evil
grin.

    "I don't know why Ryoko has any interest in such a feeble little boy
such as your self. When she could have..." Nagi bent down to his ear and
whispered.

    "....me...." Tenchi eyes grew wide with terror. He looked up into the
Bounty's eyes. Nagi just grinned again. Tenchi's mouth was open but no sound
came out. 

::tenchi::hey Nagi before ya go can you pick my balls up and put them back 
please

She grinned once more as she kissed him hard on the lips. Tenchi
didn't even attempt to struggle. She let go and winked at him.

    "Don't worry. I'll bring her back safe and sound. On one condition..."
Nagi's husky low voice trailed off.

    "W-what?" Tenchi asked. She smiled this time, emitting a gasp from him.
He thought he'd never live to see Nagi smile like that. But he did.

    "You keep that secret of how I wanted her to your self. And I won't hurt
her. Understand?" Tenchi nodded fast. She slapped him hard on the shoulder.
Tenchi winced and she just chuckled while getting up and walking toward the
center of the crash site. Ken-Ohki beamed Nagi aboard and flew off into
space.

::Washu:: SPACE BALLS!
::Tenchi:: that movie rocked

    Tenchi slowly got to his feet, holding his wound, and gazed up at the
now setting sky. Just then, Ayeka crashed through a little late. But didn't
say a word to him because that look on his face meant that he was in very
deep thought. So Ayeka just hopped off Azaka and Kamadake, walked up next to
him and looked up into the pink sky with him.

::Ryoko:: is it coincidental that the word "pink" came into play with part of 
the title name being "Yuri Attack"
::Washu:: damn them subliminal messages

ONBOARD KEN-OHKI...

    Ryoko starts to stir.

::Ryoko::stir coffee with them damn useless little plastic sticks from 
McDonalds, it's like try to stir coffee with air

    "Uhhh.... my heaaad.... maaaan...."

    Ryoko groaned as she touched her head. With her eyes still closed, she
felt she had bandages on her head. She opened her eyes only to find that she
was in a room on a bed. She stood up and walked towards the wide window and
gasped. She was knee deep in space! <How did I get here....> She thought.

::Ryoko:: knee deep in shit too for me if I know where this is going too 

    Ryoko's turned toward the door as she heard a noise. She tiptoed toward
her door and opened it slowly. She poked her head out and looked around.
<Now why does this ship look familiar...> She thought as she walked down the
hallway, looking down at the floor and being able to see right through it.

::Washu::whoa ryoko must have been some pretty hard shit ya smoked
::Ryoko:: no joke

    Ryoko continued walking until she found another door from which the
sound was coming from. She opened the door find what seemed to be the
shower. She opened the door slightly and peeked inside. Her face flushed as
she saw Nagi's well built body under steaming hot beads of water.

::Ryoko:: now the horror begins

    Nagi's breasts were being lathered in slow sexy motions. The
effervescent lather would then slide down past her thighs. Nagi slowly began
to work on her ass, sliding the sponge up, over and in between her luscious
thighs. Ryoko heard Nagi moan a low moan to herself when the sponge touched
between her legs.

::Tenchi:: revved.....<then in deep voice> for herrrr pleasure

    Ryoko had a warm feeling between her legs that she never felt before.

::Ryoko::goddamn yeast infection, though I took care of that already

Not even around Tenchi! 

::Ryoko::SO NOT TRUE, once maybe twice

Nagi turned the water off. She stepped out of the
shower as the steam floated past her feet. Beads of still steaming water
slid down her body.

    Ryoko's mind snapped as she didn't know what to do. If Nagi saw her
there, she'd never here the end of it back on Earth. But before she could
think, she looked up in time to face a wet Nagi.

::Tenchi::I hope the author enjoyed typing the words "wet Nagi" as much as I did 
reading it
::Ryoko::don't make me get the cock leash that'll shock you when you get a 
erection!
::Tenchi:: EEEP!

    Her face flushed as she stood there. Ryoko, finally coming back to her
senses, tried her best to look angry even though the universes best bounty
was standing wet in front of her.

::Tenchi::there's my favorite word again
::Ryoko:: wanna know what mine is?
::Tenchi::Umm sure, Ryoko
::Ryoko:: ELECTRIC COCK LEASH!!!
::Unknown sound:: <in little squeaky voice> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
<Every one looks down to tenchi's crotch to see his little guy do a half circle 
then flop over as if it had fainted>

    "What do you want with me Nagi?" Ryoko asked not taking her eyes from
the bounty. Nagi just stood there for a moment, dripping water on the floor.

::Washu::HER WATER BROKE!
::Ryoko::you know to be the greatest scientist in the universe that was kinda 
lame
::Washu::lets just say I flunked that class bozo

    "Why... I want nothing more than to be with you, my gorgeous Pirate."
Nagi answered in a low seductive tone, casually dropping her towel revealing
her sexy nude body still dripping with moisture. Ryoko gasped and her face
flushed again as she gazed at the bounty's sexy features.

::Ryoko::even if i was on planet Yuri for real, I would have to do better than 
Nagi
::Washu::yeah I know what you mean, you don't have a thing for muscles, I mean 
look at the guy beside you that you are madly in love with
::Tenchi:: <Gives Washu a dirty look>

    Ryoko has seen more than enough of Nagi's sexy body at the swimsuit
contest, but this tops it! She stared up and down the Bounty's built body.
Ryoko even started to drool!

::Ryoko:: again author you forget the that I ate some nuclear hell spice sauce 
with my mes`o soup before I was kidnapped

    Nagi's full breasts stood up with erect nipples that seemed to be
screaming for Ryoko's touch. Her stomach was nice and muscled; tight and
sexy; nearly making Ryoko's body ache for it's own attention.

    Nagi's thighs were long and slender with the additional muscles that
made her features much more appealing. And a thatch of neatly shaved bluish
hair peeked from Nagi's nether regions. 

::Washu::ever heard of where men stick mice? well with Nagi, it's the same but 
she couldn't find a mouse so she got a Smurf

Ryoko didn't seem to notice she had
her mouth wide open in the shape of an O the whole time. Nagi just grinned.

::Ryoko:: no I was shocked that a transsexual could have a penis that small

    "Do you like what you see?"

    Nagi asked walking toward Ryoko with slow sexy steps, then pressing her
body tight up against Ryoko's, pinning her to the wall while sending waves
of pleasure throughout her body.

::Ryoko:: (as Fic Ryoko) umm Nagi I hope you fingers can get that stiff    

"Y-yes.... I do..."

    Ryoko gasped out, feeling Nagi's wet body against her own. Nagi smirked
at Ryoko's actions. Ryoko was breathing hard too. And her nipples were
poking through her shirt. Nagi grinned and slid her fingers up Ryoko's
skirt. She jumped at Nagi's slight attention. She pressed two fingers up
against a moist spot between her legs. 

::tenchi::conditions down their can get very humid
::Washu:: and you know this to be true?
::Tenchi:: <looks to the ground and sobs> no

Ryoko bit down on her lip and wrapped
her arms around Nagi's waist and told her not to stop. She smiled and leaned
forward, pressing her lips against Ryoko's.

::Ryoko:: ahhhhhh <gets up outta her seat and starts flailing her arms around 
madly, while running around frantically>
::Washu:: what is it ryoko!?
::Ryoko:: the image in my head, IT WON'T GO AWAY!!!, <starts banging her head 
against the seat> GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT
::Tenchi:: I am enjoying my image

    Ryoko opened her mouth and slid her tongue into Nagi's mouth. Nagi
moaned and pressed her fingers harder into the moist cotton panties Ryoko
had on. Ryoko groaned into the kiss, deepening it. The kiss lasted for a few
minutes until Nagi broke it and led Ryoko to her quarters.

::Ryoko::I let my guard down for one second and BAM IT STICKS LIKE A HORRIBLE 
DISEASE! AHHHHH

    Ryoko lay sprawled out across the bed. Nagi literally tore at Ryoko's
clothing. Then she slid in between her silky legs and started kissing and
probing Ryoko's juicy clit with her tongue.

::washu::now I wish I had sent doped ayeka in here
::Tenchi:: she would like it as much as I do
::Washu:: <smiles as she thinks of a lure to get Tenchi into her lab>

    "AH! Yea..... Mmmmm... Nagi-sama...."

    Ryoko moaned and slid her finger tips into Nagi's hair, pushing her head
deeper into her juicy clit.

    "Nagi.... uhhhhh... oohhhh.. don't stop.. " She breathed out.

::Ryoko:: SHUT UP FIC ME!, I want it to stop, SELFISH BITCH!

    Seconds later, Ryoko shouted Nagi's name came into her mouth. Nagi
slurped up as much as she could. Ryoko pulled her up to her and kissed her
sliding her tongue deep into her mouth. Tasting herself in Nagi's mouth.
Ryoko rolled the pair over and evilly grinned at a surprised Nagi. Ryoko
then thrust three digits into Nagi's went cunt.

    "OoooooHHHHH GODDDDDD! RYOKO YESSSS!! MmMmMmMm! Soo gooood!!"

    Nagi moaned as Ryoko continued to finger fuck her. Ryoko kept pushing
deeper into Nagi's cunt until her walls tightened and she came all over
Ryoko's face and chest.

    Nagi started to lay Ryoko in 69 and inserted her fingers into Ryoko's
moist cunt. Ryoko was faced with Nagi's wet cunt as she leaned forward and
licked it while sucking it. Nagi worked furiously as Ryoko did the same. The
women screamed in orgasm as Nagi lay next to Ryoko and helped her lick the
mess they made off each other.

::Tenchi:: my new favorite word, YURI!
::Ryoko:: <Ryoko Bursts out> COCK SHOCKER!
::Tenchi:: <like a dog that's been shocked by his collar>
::Ryoko:: <Pets his head> good boy

    Nagi sat up and grinned seeing Ryoko's face covered with her cum. Ryoko
was busy licking herself clean while Nagi leaned forward and helped her out.
Ryoko giggled sleepily as Nagi nibbled on one of her cum covered nipples.
Nagi slid back up and kissed Ryoko's now sleepy form.

::Washu:: what did they discover Niagara Falls, for Christ sake a women can only 
cum SO MUCH
::Ryoko:: and you would know how?
::Washu:: I do experiments on my......... um Mondays <emotion of relief passes 
over her face>

    "Sleep my pirate. You need your rest."

    Nagi kissed her forehead and then kissed her lips as Ryoko closed her
cat-like hazel eyes. Nagi slid the soft lavender velvet sheets over Ryoko's
slim body. She got up to go shower again and looked back upon Ryoko's
sleeping form. She smirked. <She looks so innocent when she sleeps....> Nagi
though to her self as she closed the door.

::Washu:: what do we have behind door number 1, ryoko
::Ryoko:: <in announcer voice> we have a lesbian bounty hunter who will be 
fiddling with herself, retail value: a nickel

HOURS LATER....

    Tenchi watched Ryoko from the doorway, but kept his distance. He would
never tell of Nagi's wild desires nor would he believe it.

::Tenchi:: (as fic Tenchi) but I would sure the hell fantasize about it

 He just sighed
quietly and walked past her room.

    Ryoko was plopped on her bed, looking up in the sky in time to see
Nagi's craft blaze off into space. She sighed and lay back on her pillow
while thinking deeply.

::Ryoko:: (as fic Ryoko) Did she use protection?

    "What are you up to this time Nagi...." Ryoko thought aloud to herself.
She looked up at the now twilight sky, catching sight of Ken-Ohki blaze off
into space.
                                   END

:all walk out of theatre:
<Ryoko> holy jeans Batman!
<Washu> So Tenchi, change your mind about coming to my lab yet?
<Tenchi> umm I guess I could little Washu, but if I see any  funny business I am 
leaving
<Washu> Fair enough
:strange sounds of moaning and grunting appear, and they all rush to the source, 
Washu's lab:
:they all try to crowd into the area where they could look the little piece of 
glass on the door where ayeka is being held:
::Ayeka:: o yeah that's the spot, uh uh ahhh uh mmmmmmmm.
::Washu:: lets see, cappuccino doesn't make people do that
::Ryoko:: I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE :bursts into laughter again: when ayeka was 
moving so slow to the cappuccino machine I had gotten the brilliant idea to lace 
it with some Spanish fly that Washu had made AHHAHAHAHAHAHA
::Tenchi:: why ryoko?
::Ryoko:: Because every time I lock her in a closet some one lets her out before 
we are done with the fic and this time I scored, she stayed in there the whole 
fic, YESSS, who ya mamma?! :as she yells with delight at the door: who's ya 
mamma!
::Ayeka:: uhh ah mmmmm you retched beast, I will get you for this
::Washu:: 'in ryoko's mind' well since your acting like such a little girl, you 
don't get to be my spy now, I need a women not a girl
::Ryoko:: <drops to her knees on the floor and throws her arms in the air toward 
the ceiling> N-N-N-OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

::MST Author::
well I liked the idea of them two getting together I was reluctant to MST it, 
but I have fans I don't wanna disappoint. but to the original author, sometimes 
you seemed to hold back from getting nasty and other times you just let it all 
hang out, not good with the dialog, I suggest you rewatch all the OAV's to brush 
up on their dialog.....but it was still stupid, boring, I'll be their to pounce 
on chapter 2 when you stick it out their so beware when you post MWUAHAH, 
*regains composer* heh sorry got carried away there, until then I'm out l8r
