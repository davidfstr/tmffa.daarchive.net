Murasaki Cascade

Twin purple tresses cascade like waterfalls
Coursing through my world

A temper burning hotter than the sun
A sweetness everlasting
Demure smile flashing shy love's desire

Searcher for her love
Discoverer of heartbreak

Tear streaked face
Witness of destruction
Soothe her sorrow with the hope of love

Sister-Protector,
Nightmare comforter
Guardian of a young child goddess

Soul of courage
Bearer of duty's mountain
Possessor of indomitable strength
Wielder of power beyond mortal ken

Beneath the power, beneath the crown
Beats the heart of a girl who only wants love

Dreamer of Heaven & Earth
Take solace in your love
And pray that dreams come true.


	This poem is a work in progress, which may never be completed.
There's a story of how this OVA based poem came about.  Late one night,
many months ago, I was reading through the AFC Message Board.
Davner proposed a poetry contest, and started things off by introducing a
new beatnik poet, Dawner, whose free verse poetry recital was interrupted
by a rather miffed Juraian princess.
	It was at this point that my muse decided to come
calling, resulting in the first version of this poem, as told by
another beatnik poet named Beagle-nik. ^_^

	So if you liked it, thank Davner for the inspiration.  If you
didn't, the fault is none but mine.
