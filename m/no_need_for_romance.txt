Z embla, Zenda, Xanadu:

R ead and bring me home to you.

                                -dedication at the beginning of
                                 Haroun and the Sea of Stories,

    Tenchi sank down heavily onto the couch; it had been a very
trying day. Ryoko and Ayeka had been at it again, tooth and nail--
unfortunately for Tenchi he kept getting in the way of those teeth
and those nails. The overstuffed couch was nice and comfortable--
cozy even. The worst was the tug-of-war match, with Tenchi standing
in for a rope. If it weren't for Sasami coming to the rescue--
Tenchi shuddered to think of what might have happened.
    Luckily for Tenchi, Sasami wanted him to help get something
from the top shelf for dinner: a particular spice the smaller girl
could not reach. Ryoko and Ayeka acted instinctively, volunteering
to do it; it would not do for cute little Sasami to be alone with
Tenchi, kitchen or not, young princess or not.
    The night sky had descended hours ago, cloaking the outdoors
like a shroud and making the lighted living room feel even more
inviting. Everyone else was asleep, so it was peaceful right now,
something Tenchi had always treasured but especially now because it
was so rare anymore. A sigh escaped his lips as he thought about
the next day and then pushed the thought aside and concentrated on
the sofa.
    A small clatter of plates behind him tipped Tenchi off that
thre was somebody else awake. He looked behind him to find Kiyone
with a tray and a tea set on top of it. Tenchi smiled slightly,
mimicking the quiet one Kiyone wore. He had forgotten that her and
Mihoshi had visited for dinner and were spending the night; Mihoshi
tried to officiate in a drinking contest between Ryoko and Ayeka,
but ended up becoming a participant and drinking both of them under
the table.
    Three drunk women might not have been a problem to some, and
Ryoko was in fact not too bad-- on her own. Ryoko turned out to be
a rather mellow, but extremely sensitive and emotional drunk. Ayeka
had a sharp, almost mean side to her when drunk. Mihoshi though,
Mihoshi turned melancholic to the point of becoming lugubrious.
    Ayeka made some remark to Ryoko, who started bawling while
Ayeka just looked on and laughed. Mihoshi, on the other hand, cried
and cried and cried and cried, holding onto Kiyone's waist and not
letting go for dear life, regardless of Kiyone's attempts move or
pry Mihoshi off of her. Mihoshi would only cry more and try to get
Kiyone to promise she would never leave Mihoshi: that they would be
partners and best friends forever. Kiyone was trying to do just
that, but could not get a word in edgewise-- she had to have had at
least as hard a day as Tenchi's.

    Kiyone sat the platter down on the table in front of the
L-shaped couch. She poured two glasses of tea, setting one down in
front of Tenchi. She sat down on the other side of the couch and
looked at Tenchi. A small half-grin crept across her face as she
raised her glass towards Tenchi in a kind of toast. Tenchi knew
what it was about and followed suit, a tired smile on his face. Two
warriors, saluting each other for surviving another day of battles.
Tenchi and Kiyone sat in utter silence as they slowly drank their
tea.

Comment if you will, criticise if you will. No author's notes, no
need for them, I think (wow, I _must_ be tired to say that!) :)

Sheen watched his flight. "I forgot to mention the most
important thing," he murmured. "If there's one thing a mind
can't avoid, it is its automatic aversion to evil. The
moment he lets it into himself, he places his feet on the
road to demolition."
