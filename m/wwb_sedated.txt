We Wanna Be Sedated


Washu: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show?
I wanna be sedated
Mihoshi's in my lab and she's breaking up the place
I wish she'd fall out of Yagami and jump in space
and keep floating floating floating till she gets hit in the face
I wish I wish I wish

Noboyuki: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show?
I wanna be sedated
There's six hot ladies in here I said Hip hip hooray!
But Tenchi foolishly keeps on running far away
I'm thinking to myself Oh my God, my son is gay.
Oh no Oh no Oh no!

Sasami: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
I don't have a real part in this crazy show!
I wanna be sedated
But what's this with the lemons? Dammit I'm only eight! (sorta)
With these crazy crazy people commiting statutory rape
After all of that, I'm surprised I'm walking straight.
Oh geez, Oh geez, Oh geez!

Kiyone: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
Somebody get me off  this crazy show!
I wanna be sedated
First of all  Mihoshi and I are NOT GAY!!
She's gone and shit herself. That's the seventh time today.
If she goes on bout the wargones I swear I'll put her away
Oh yay! Oh yay! Oh yay!

Ayeka: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show?
I wanna be sedated
Azaka! Kamedake! Fire a shot to warn! (BOOM!)
Ryoko's getting on my nerves. She's getting on my spinal cord.
And what is with the fan art with me drawn flat as a board
Oh lord! Oh lord! Oh lord! Azaka and Kamedake: Kumbaya
Ayeka:Hey! That's not supposed to be in there!

Frieza???: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
I am not even on this crazy show!!!
Please leave me out of this
It's true I'm white and purple, I look like a punky girl
But there is someone crazier in this stupid world
Her name is Ryoko and.... Oh shit here she comes!
Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

Ryoko: Twenty twenty twenty twenty minutes ago
I got a piece of Tenchi
I have been blessed with impeccable yabos.
I got a piece of Tenchi
So what if you didn't see me do it in the show?
I'll be thanking Lenny Quites and more lemon writers though
I rode him like a race horse and boom Tenchi did go.
Ayeka is a ho!

Nagi: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna catch Ryoko
Fuck this stupid show who the hell am I kidding?
I wanna eat Ryoko
In the script I hate Ryoko. I don't know why I do.
And over that Ayeka has been bothering me too
In Tenchi Go Boom 5 I'll soon be flossing blue
Yahoo yahoo yahoo!

Grandpa: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show?
I wanna be sedated
How many times must I ask you not to bother me.
No I did not sodomize Ryo-Ohki
Just leave me alone and let me drink my fucking tea!
Oh gee Oh gee Oh gee!

Tenchi: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show
I wanna be sedated
A bunch of horny women are begging me for sex
Ryoko's standing over here with a bare chest
Hold on a minute. Anybody got a kleenex?
Thinking: "Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh yes!"

Tenchi: Seven seven seven hundred years to go
I wanna be sedated
How did I end up on this crazy show?
I wanna be sedated
I'm under a constant barrage of double D's
I could have been doing two gorgeous enemies
But I'm stuck inside the future humping dead trees
Oh please! Oh please! oh please!

Ryo-Ohki: Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow,
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
End

Just so you know I don't own any of these characters. Don't sue me. If your
lawyers are the kind who won't stop sucking till they draw blood, good luck.
I'm a broke anemic. Give me some credit here! That meow thing took a really
long time.
