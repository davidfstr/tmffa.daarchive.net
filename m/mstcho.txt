Chocolates, chocolates, and more chocolates...

MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans a.k.a. JOLT!!!

I am finally at my twenty-ninth fanfic and boy, does it feel good to get
off that A-ko fanfic. I think I can get my thirtieth MSTied fanfic done
before the first of June. Wish me luck!

LEGAL STUFF: All the Anime characters in the following MST belongs to
the talented and creative people who made them. Please don't sue me for
I am merely borrowing your characters and not making any claim on them.
The Club Anipike belongs to Nightbreak, whom I am grateful to for
allowing me to use it. Samantha Jones a.k.a. Silhouette, belongs to me,
Jamie Jeans

Now, on to the show!
________________________________________________________________________

        The Club Anipike was jumping with customers as various people,
coming in from the break in between the first and second rounds of the
Author Avatar Tournament. Not only were there people from many various
Anime shows, but several MSTiers were there as well. On several large
screen TVs were replays of the first eight matches as well as interviews
with many of the self-inserted characters. One of the screens was
currently replaying the footage of Samantha Jones Ki blasting Adam Chris
Leigh during his interview with Michael Cole.

        Misato and Jotouro were working overtime as they attempted to
meet the orders of everyone at the Club Anipike even as C-ko and Akane
were cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Shouting out, Misato caught the
attention of Mihoshi and Aeka, directing them to help out in the
kitchen.

        "You gotta remain calm," a young man was speaking to a beautiful
redhead.

        "Remain calm? That *jerk* kept on insulting Mihoshi for no god
damned reason," Samantha Jones shouted back. The two were seated across
from each other

        "And if A-ko and Ryouko hadn't been there, you would have killed
him," Washu said, coming up from behind her and taking a seat.

        "Hi Washu," the man said.

        "Hello Jamie. You getting a drink too?"

        Jamie swished the remainder of his drink around before setting
the glass down. "Just some pop, Washu. I can't handle anything
stronger." Looking over her, he saw a familiar face and got up. "Look,
I'm gonna talk with some friends for a little bit. I'll catch you
later."

        The two redheads watched him go and caught little pieces of his
conversation.

        "How you getting on, Seth?"

        "Just great, Jamie. You meet Megane yet?"

        "Oh my god! It's a pleasure to meet you!"

        "Same here..."

        "Hey, Timothy, come on over here!"

        "Yeah, what is it Michael? Oh hi, Jamie. What are you doing
here?"

        "Same as you. Just getting a drink and awaiting the second round
of the AA Tournament..."

        The two characters tuned out the talk and concentrated on their
drinks. "that was a good Ki blast, Samantha," Washu finally said.

        "Thanks. I have to thank Piccolo for that one."

        "Nihao," shouted a familiar voice over the roar of the crowd.

        Turning around, Samantha spotted Shampoo and Rei just coming
into the Club, the Amazon holding a small leaflet of paper in her hands.

        "How are you doing?" Rei asked.

        "Just killing some time before the next part of the AA
tournament starts," Washu replied.

        "Good, because I have the perfect thing to do away the time
with," the Senshi said.

        "Shampoo find goofy massive crossover on net just now. Want to
riff it?" Shampoo asked.

        Samantha perked up. She had a good chunk of aggression to work
out and riffing a fanfic was the perfect to get it done. "Okay. Lets
go."
                                *               *               *
<The theater doors opened and Samantha, Washu, Rei, and Shampoo enter.
Samantha sits down in the fourth seat while Shampoo takes the fourth.
Washu sits in the second even as Rei takes the first.>

SHAMPOO: Only thing Shampoo not like about AA tournament.
REI: What's that?
SHAMPOO: Pat Lee won over Wolf.
SAMANTHA: Wolf? Oh, that Wolverine rip off.
WASHU: Don't worry Shampoo, he'll get his butt kicked by Adam Chris
	Leigh....
SAMANTHA: Grrr...
WASHU: That is, if Samantha hasn't killed hum by then.

>Disclaimer:  All characters portrayed in this story are the property of their respective 
>creators and companies.  I don't own any of them. Please don't sue me.

SAMANTHA: <lawyer> Oh, we won't. MWAHAHAHAHA!!!

>This story takes place after volume 38 of the Ranma manga.  It draws ideas from anime 
>of all the series involved.

REI: Uh-oh. I never did read the Manga.
SAMANTHA: Neither have I.
SHAMPOO: Shampoo make most riffs then.

>This is special number 2 of my crossover series and takes place after
the first one.

WASHU: Well at least he knows basic arithmetic.

>C & C welcomed.  Flames not.

REI: Too late!

>A Ranma/Sailor Moon/Ah! My Goddess/Tenchi Muyo!/Yu Yu Hakusho/Nuku
>Nuku/Darkstalkers crossover

ALL: <stare in shock>
SAMANTHA: where did he get the money to pay all of you?
SHAMPOO: No idea but it okay fanfic we stared in.
WASHU: Actually, I have this strange feeling that it sort of comes close
	to ripping apart the Time/Space continuum.
SAMANTHA: Like Minako in...
REI: It wasn't her fault Nightman wrote such a bad script!
WASHU: Joxer and Serenity... <shudders>

>Chocolates, Chocolates, and More Chocolates

REI: Authors, authors, and more authors...

>By

SHAMPOO: Man in Iron mask.

>Donny Cheng

> Ranma awoke as he felt someone prodding his body.  "What is it..? Erk!"  Botan, the 
>spirit guide for the dead, stood over him.

SAMANTHA: <whispering> Who's that?
WASHU: I have no idea.

> "Ranma, your time has come!  I've come for your body."

REI: IfyouknowwhatImean!

>Botan's voice was disturbingly quiet.

WASHU: Meaning that Ramna couldn't hear her at all.

>"I'm dead!?  How?"  Ranma didn't feel any different.  Akane didn't try to feed him last 
>night, so it couldn't be that.

SAMANTHA: Hey, I'll have you know that Akane makes some of *the* best
	spagetthi this side of the Club Anipike!

> "Who said anything about you being dead?  I said that I've come for your body," Botan 
>giggled.

REI: <pointing at screen> See? See?
SHAMPOO: You bad influenza, Samantha.
SAMANTHA: I can't help it.

>Her merriment did nothing to hide the longing in her eyes.  Maybe it wasn't all that 
>much of a joke after all.  Ranma, of course, didn't notice any of this.

WASHU: He was too busy trying not to stare at her...
SHAMPOO: Don't you start.

> "Jeez, I hate it when you do that," Ranma groaned.  Botan had one of the weirdest 
>humors he knew of.  "What did you want, Botan?"

SAMANTHA: She just told you: your body!

> "Oh, just this."  Botan suddenly became nervous as she handed to him the box she had 
>carefully wrapped this morning.

REI: She had better be nervous! C-4 is very touchy stuff.

> Curious, Ranma took the box.  He started to shake it as if he could tell what it was by 
>the sound.

SAMANTHA: <makes bomb exploding noise>
WASHU: <Policeman's voice> Eight years on the Bomb Squad, right?
SHAMPOO: Now how many people get that one?

> "No," Botan nearly screamed, "don't shake it.  Just open it when you have the time.  
>Um, I have to go now.  Koenma only allowed me five minutes for a break."

REI: <Botan> She is such a slave driver.

>Botan then hopped back on board her paddle-like transport.  She wrestled with herself 
>internally as she looked at Ranma's confused face.  Fighting down a blush, she added, 
>"And, it comes from the bottom of my heart."

WASHU: <Ramna voice> that would certainly explain all this blood over
	it.
EVERYONE ELSE: Eww!

> Ranma waved goodbye to Botan as she left.  He then turned his attention on the box.  
>Carefully, like Botan had said, he opened it. His eyes took in the contents and his heart 
>stopped.

SHAMPOO: Ramna need to cut down on fatty intake.

>He quickly looked up at the wall where a calendar hung.  Valentine's Day.  A day when 
>girls gave chocolates to the boys that they liked.  A feeling of dread came over him.  
>Funny, he never figured that he would die so young.

REI: Hey, when I died, I was younger the you!

>   * * * * *

WASHU: <singing> Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

>Nodoka busily went around the kitchen cleaning up the mess in the kitchen caused the 
>previous night's activities.

SAMANTHA: Uh, too easy. Not going to touch it.

>Despite all the work that stood before her, she had smile on her face.

SHAMPOO: Great 'A' strike of 98 left many fanfics without first letter
	of alphabet...

>Today was going to be a very great day if last night was any indication.  She hadn't been 
>surprised when a timid Akane had come to her asking for help making a batch of 
>chocolates.  What did surprise her was Ukyo, one of Ranma suitors, also came asking 
>for help in making sweets.  Shampoo came not much later.  It seemed growing up as a 
>boy or as an amazon didn't give a person much experience on Valentine's Day. Nodoka 
>had been more than glad to help the girls in their pursuit of her son.  Her son's 
>manliness overwhelmed her sometimes.

ALL: AH!!!
SAMANTHA: Oh man that was bad!
SHAMPOO: Shampoo feel ill.
REI: Is Greg and Mike writing this under a new name?
WASHU: I hope it doesn't get any worst then that.

> [Oh, wife!]  A panda bear came up to her holding the sign.
>
> Nodoka looked at the flowers in her husband's furry paws.  "Let's get us some how 
>water," she murmured breathlessly.  This was a good day to thank him for getting her 
>manly son so many wonderful fiancées.

REI: It was also a perfect day for Ramna to start cursing out his dad
	for setting him up with so many fiancees.

>   * * * * *
>
> "That little... When I get my hands on her, she's going to wish she'd never been born!"  
>Rei was furious as she roamed about the temple.

WASHU: Why were you furious?
REI: Just read it...

> "We don't know for sure, Rei.  Usagi already has Mamoru.  You don't really think that 
>she would visit another boy just because he's away at America do you?" Ami meekly 
>tried to intercede on Usagi's behalf, but gave up when the rest of the girls stared at her 
>with disbelief.  Their princess would do it and in a moment.

SAMANTHA: Okay, the massive crossover I could deal with, but Usagi
	cheating on Mamoru? No way!
REI: I really hated this part.
SHAMPOO: Same here. Ramna marry Shampoo one day!
WASHU: It's a fanfic, you should really relax.

> "Come on, let's get there before she hogs him to herself."  Minako cradled a small 
>package in her hands.

ALL: Chocolates.

>Honestly, they all worked hard at Makoto's to make these and Usagi was going to be 
>there first.  Some people have all the nerve.  She grabbed Artemis, slung him over her 
>shoulder,

WASHU: <Artemis voice> Ahh!!! Oscar flashback! AHH!!!

>and raced out the door.

SHAMPOO: Should be through door since she never opened it.

> Makoto bigsweated.  "She left without us."
>
> "Well, what are we waiting for?  Let's go too!"  Rei and the rest quickly followed after 
>Minako.

SAMANTHA: It's the first Annual Senshi marathon!

>   * * * * *
>
> "So the other girls ran out on you, hey?" Haruka asked Chibi-Usa as the little tot and 
>Hotaru got their packages ready.  A grin crept up on to her face.  She didn't envy her 
>former rival at this moment.  She almost felt pity for Ranma.  Almost.

WASHU: Huh?
SAMANTHA: Former rival? Did they go up against each other in a Martial
	Arts tournament or something?
SHAMPOO: Even Shampoo confused.
REI: And I'm not too far behind you.

> Chibi-Usa nodded, "That Usagi!  What kind of mother does that to her daughter?"
>
> "Haruka, wait a moment!" Michiru called out to them before they could leave.  She ran 
>up and placed a small gift-wrapped box in Haruka's hands.  "Better not be late tonight," 
>she winked at the now very red Haruka before leaving.
>
> "What was that all about?" Hotaru asked as they got into the car.

SAMANTHA: <holding head> Who is that?!
WASHU: I feel a massive headache coming on.

> If possible, Haruka blushed even more.  "I... I'll tell you about it when you're older."
>
>   * * * * *

REI: <singing> When you wish upon a star...

> Keiichi didn't think anyone could be happier than he was at the moment.  Belldandy at 
>his side and a box of chocolates between them. Urd and Skuld out of the house.  
>Nothing can be more perfect.  Hmm...Where were Urd and Skuld?

SHAMPOO: Skuld no worry about. Urd, on the other hand...

>   * * * * *
>
> Skuld blushed as she her thoughts began to wander again.

WASHU: Oh look, there they go...

>How was she to know that Ranma was taking a bath that time she visited?  Ever since 
>popping up out of the Tendo Dojo's furo and into Ranma's arms, she decided to walk 
>there anytime she wanted to see Ranma.  Strangely, she felt saddened by her choice.  
>She blushed again as she the thought of Ranma's body flitted past her mind again.  She
>knew one thing, she couldn't wait to see him again.

REI: But she's only twelve years old!
SAMANTHA: <mumbling> Please don't go there, please don't go there...

>   * * * * *
>
> Urd smiled as she held a chocolate piece in front of her for inspection.

SAMANTHA: Accidentally taking a whiff, she keeled over from her own
	cooking.

>Perfect!  Ranma was just going to love this.  Wow, working in the kitchen all this time 
>made her thirsty.

WASHU: Is this a story or the author's thoughts?
REI: Both.
WASHU: Oh, okay... wha?

>She glanced at the bottle of extra super strong special sake beside her.  It was empty.  
>Maybe she used a tad too much for the centers in the chocolate pieces.

SHAMPOO: Shampoo show you proper way of doing it later.

>Oh well, it just meant she would have to wait until she and Ranma shared them with 
>each other.  Hahaha!

ALL: BWAHAHAHA!!!

>   * * * * *
>
> Morrigan smiled as she held a chocolate piece in front of her for inspection.  Perfect!  
>Ranma was just going to love this.  She glanced at the

REI: Clock on the wall and realized that she was late for her first
	round with Felicia.

>various potions in front of her.  If this didn't make Ranma lose he inhibitions, nothing 
>would.  That boy was just too naïve at times. What did he think she wanted when she 
>visited him last week in the middle of the night wearing even less than she usually did?

SHAMPOO: Ramna not naive, he just shy.

>Of course, Lilith, the other part of her soul, thought that it was cute and made her leave 
>before she could educate him further.

SAMANTHA: Yeah, those other souls can give you quite a bit of trouble
	when you least want it!

>This time, she wouldn't listen to that little minx and Ranma will be hers.  Hehehe!

REI: Uh oh. Looks like the Joker hit her with his laughing gas.

>   * * * * *

WASHU: This celestial body is commonly known as...

> Kodachi smiled as she held a chocolate piece in front of her for inspection.  Perfect!  
>Ranma-sama was just going to love this.  She glanced at the various paralysis potions in 
>front of her.  Honestly, how did Ranma expect her to catch him if he kept on moving all 
>the time.  She could imagine what would happen when she held him in her arms.  
>Hohoho!

SAMANTHA: Oh man! Isn't there *any* originality left in this fanfic at
	all?
SHAMPOO: It like watching Part 2 of Back to the Future. reruns over and
	over again.
WASHU: Just like the Power Rangers show.

>   * * * * *
>
> "Ryoko, so do you understand?"  Ryoko asked herself.
>
> "Of course, what do you take me for?"  Ryoko replied to herself.

REI: Thus giving a new meaning to the term: Split personality.

> "Just what do you think you're doing?"  Ayeka asked as walked outside of the temple to 
>where the Ryokos stood.
>
> "None of your business!"  Both Ryokos said simultaneously.

WASHU: At least the writer had written my daughter correctly.

> "You aren't thinking of splitting up and going to Nerima are you?  I always knew that 
>you weren't right for Tenchi with your lecherous ways."  Ayeka looked at the two 
>Ryokos with disdain.

SHAMPOO: As opposed to open disgust.

 >The Ryokos became one again and energy started forming in her hands. "Oh?  And to 
>why does it seem that you have two packages in your hand? I don't suppose one of them 
>is for someone other than Tenchi."

SAMANTHA: Is everyone giving a box of chocolates to Ramna? What about
	the other guys in the series? I'm sure Ryouga would get one from Ukyo or
	someone else...

> Ayeka carefully put down the two boxes of chocolates in her hand down on a safer 
>place.  Humans certainly had strange customs on special holidays.  One she set them 
>down,

WASHU: And remember proper spelling...

>she turned a faced Ryoko.  Electricity cackled all around her and their ongoing fight 
>began anew.

REI: The Hydro bill is going to be enormous!

> Sasami and Washu watched this from the sidelines with bored expressions.  Fortunately 
>they had both handed their gifts for Ranma to Ryo-ohki to take to him in advance.  They 
>were both free to spend the day with Tenchi when he got back from his chores.

SHAMPOO: Smart move, Washu.
WASHU: Thank you.

>   * * * * *
>
> Kyusaku shook his head with disbelief as he finished off another batch of chocolates.  
>Nine hundred more to go.  When he had told Nuku Nuku that girls made chocolates and 
>gave them to boys on Valentine's day, he never expected her to make them for every 
>boy in school.

SAMANTHA: What school? Last time I checked, she wasn't in one.
REI: You are really mad, aren't you? You've been nitpicking all fanfic.
SAMANTHA: Sorry. Adam just...
WASHU: Give it a rest and relax.

>It took him awhile to explain that the 'like' she felt for Ranma was one that really 
>mattered on this special day.  After hearing that, his daughter bounded out the door as 
>fast she could.

SAMANTHA: I'm guessing that the first part of this series was all the
	girls *meeting* Ramna.

> <Ring> <Ring>
>
> Kyusaku stopped in midst of eating yet another chocolate pieces

REI: Whoa! That's a big piece!

>and picked up the phone.  "Hello?"
>
> "I've sent a baby sitter to the house.  Meet me at eight at the old place.  Oh, and do 
>bathe and dress nicely."  Came a cold sounding voice from the other end.

WASHU: <cold voice> Leave one hundred thousand dollars in unmarked bills
	on the corner of Fifth and Main by ten thirty tonight.

> <Click>
>
> Kyusaku glared at the phone.

SHAMPOO: <Kyusaku> Stupid phone, god I hate you!

>For some reason, he couldn't hold it on his face.  It kept dropping into a foolish looking 
>grin.

REI: The phone or his face?

>   * * * * *
>
> Ranma stared at water

WASHU: That should be stared at *the* water.
SAMANTHA: You're not starting that again, are you?
WASHU: NO, I just couldn't come up with a better riff.

>as he stood near the bridge's railing.  He had made sure to choose a different bridge this 
>time so he could not be found.  Why couldn't he keep his big mouth shut!?  He 
>questioned himself for what felt like the hundredth time.

SHAMPOO: After all, he kept count.

> The day had been a disaster the moment the first of the girls started to appear.  The 
>moment he was offered one box of chocolates another offer came right behind.  It didn't 
>take long for them to compete who would get him to eat whose chocolates first.

SAMANTHA: <annoucer's voice> YES IT'S THE ROYAL RUMBLE OF THE ANIME
	GIRLS WHERE THE WINNER TAKES RAMNA!!!
EVERYONE ELSE: <hands over ears> Ow.

> The later events became a blur in his memory.  Somehow or other, Urd, Morrigan, and 
>Kodachi each managed to stuff a piece of chocolate in his face.  It had the weird of 
>affect of making him speak his mind. Literally!  He briefly remembered his exact 
>words to them as being 'LEAVE ME ALONE, ALL OF YOU'.  He cringed as he thought 
>at how loud he must have sounded.  The only thing he wanted to do now was curl up 
>and die.
>
> "I don't think that such a good idea," A feminine voice called out.

REI: God?
WASHU: Besides, you'll be spared being brought into allot of crappy
	fanfics... hmmm...

> "Huh?"  Ranma broke out of his depression thoughts and looked at the woman in front 
>of him.  She was tall with long flowing hair.  Her face, while beautiful, held an ageless 
>quality making it hard to determine her exact age.

SAMANTHA: Shion? What the heck is she doing here?

>She seemed be anywhere from her late teens to her late twenties.  Had she read his 
>mind?
>
> "Standing so close to the railing I mean," she explained to Ranma.
>
> "Oh.  Don't worry, I wasn't about the jump or anything stupid.  I guess I just didn't 
>notice how close I was to the edge," Ranma assured her.

REI: Okay, the lady with the pail of water should be around here
	somewhere.

 >"A lot on your mind?  Sometimes it helps to let out your feelings rather than let them 
>fester inside of you.  I'm not going anywhere soon."

SHAMPOO: Next on Jerry Springer show...

> Ranma felt himself drawn in by the kind and comforting tone.  He soon related the 
>entire day's events to her.  "...then I rushed out of there and here I am," Ranma finished 
>and reached for another piece of chocolate the lady had kindly offered to share with 
>him.  She didn't seem to eat any herself though.

SAMANTHA: Probably because of the large amount of poison she had laced
	them with.
REI: Feeling dark?
SAMANTHA: <sarcastic> Naw!

> "And here you are.  I'm sure the girls would forgive you for your outburst.  It was 
>understandable under the circumstances."

WASHU: After all, most men would just hate it when several young and
	beautiful women beings them chocolates at one time.

> "Oh, I know they will.  They're all really nice, despite how some of them act 
>sometimes.  In truth, it might have been the best thing I've ever done, walking out like 
>that.  If I had stayed, they would have continued fighting over me, getting angry at each 
>other..."

SHAMPOO: And then Shampoo would have to fight off even *more* suitors!

> "...and you figured that this way they will all be angry at you instead.  Ranma, Ranma, 
>Ranma," she sighed as gently admonished him.

SAMANTHA: Who's Gently?
WASHU: Brother of Kindly.
SHAMPOO: Cousin to Happily.
REI: And father to Cheerfully.

>"Do you really think this would make them happier?  The only reason, the girls came to 
>you in the first place was to be with you.  Why? Because today is a special day to many 
>girls, and who better to spend it with then the boy they like.  Sure, they may fight, but I 
>think they would be more then willing to put aside their differences if it meant they 
>could enjoy this holiday with you.  Why don't you give them another chance?  I'm sure it 
>will turn out better."

WASHU: Just like a brick is soft.

> Ranma believed her.  He didn't know why, but he felt as if could trust this stranger.  
>Stranger?  He rubbed his head sheepishly.  "Thank you, um, Miss..."

REI: Ayumi?
SHAMPOO: Cologne?
SAMANTHA: Ayunami?
WASHU: Masaki?

> "Setsuna.  Call me Setsuna, Ranma."

SAMANTHA: I have no idea who that is.

> "Miss Set... um, I mean Setsuna.  Thank you for your advice.  Oops, I accidentally ate 
>all of your chocolates.  Sorry, about that."  She must have been saving them for her 
>boyfriend.  Now he blew it.

SHAMPOO: BIG TIME!

> Surprisingly, Setsuna seemed to be pleased rather than angry with him.  "That's okay, 
>Ranma.  They were going to go to waste whether you ate them or not."  Setsuna then 
>turned and left.
>
> Ranma didn't believe her.  A wonderful woman like that had to have a boyfriend.  She 
>was just being kind to him by not telling him otherwise.
>
>   * * * * *

SAMANTHA: All right, anyone have a new star joke?

> "You must have it bad, Urd.  I can't imagine you in a kitchen making chocolate."  
>Morrigan laughed at that thought.

SHAMPOO: But didn't she say it?
WASHU: Details, details...

> Urd glared but then schooled her features.  "I suppose those chocolates of yours are 
>store bought?" she asked cooly.

REI: <Morrigan voice> Why of course they... D'OH!

> "No, I made them from..." Morrigan grimaced.  Urd caught her with her own words.  
>She must have had it bad, if she was so besotted with the boy that she couldn't even 
>think straight.
>
> Ryo-ohki suffered under the ministrations of the various girls as they each took turns 
>petting her.

SAMANTHA: <Ryo-oh-ki> Ack! Not so hard!

>Perhaps, suffered is the right word for how she felt.  Skuld seem to take more than her 
>fair share of the time though.  Nobody commented on the hammer she held in her arm 
>as she looked at Ryo-ohki was a gleam in her eyes.

SHAMPOO: Oh no! Skuld gone nuts!
REI: <Skuld voice> You will be mine. Oh yes, you will be mine.

> Usagi stared at the others like at deer at an oncoming car.  "It's not what you think!  
>He's my cousin!  Can't I do something nice for a family member?"

SAMANTHA: Ramna is Usagi's cousin? <groans and holds head>
WASHU: Oh yeah. I had completely forgotten about this part.

> "No!" came the resounding reply from Rei and Minako.  Ami's 'no' was much softer.
>
> Nuku Nuku stood by Shampoo talking about the art of being a waitress. The two girls 
>had become great friends in the short time that they knew each other.

SHAMPOO: Cat-girl show me cool flip to do on bike!

> Makoto asked Ukyo for tips on making okonomiyaki.  They too hit it off after they 
>each learned their dreams of becoming a chef was similar.

REI: Look at it this way, Samantha. At least they're all not gather to
	fight their enemies or something.

> Kodachi seemed to be in a daze.  Her Ranma-sama thanked her as he ate the only piece 
>of chocolate of her gift not lace with paralysis potion.  She decided to take that as a 
>compliment.

WASHU: A good thing she didn't see him tossing his cookies in the
	corner.

> Akane smiled as she watched Ranma eat a piece of her chocolate and didn't complain.  
>He actually complimented her.  The only thing that puzzled her was why he asked her if 
>there was any salt left.

ALL: Huh?

> Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, being viewed as little girls, didn't receive much attention as they 
>hogged most of Ranma's time.

SAMANTHA: Who *is* that?

> It was an odd gathering.

WASHU: And a massive crossover.

>Ranma surrounded by girls smiling and handing him their gifts.  For once, he believed
