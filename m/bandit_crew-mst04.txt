<Uhsaw>(As Alfred Hitchcock,pipe and everything,somewhere inside of the SS.Bandit)
Good eve-a-ning,today the Bandit crew will be msting a tale of terror and maylay.

<Everyone else>(Stands up and gets shocked back into place)

<Hunter>Yeah,you said this fic was dark!
<Uhsaw>NOW!!!

<Jimmy>Can I plug in my night light?
<Uhsaw>(shocks Jimmy)There now you can stick a light bulb in your mouth!!!
<Chris>(walks up beside Uhsaw)Okay crew who wants to see death and destruction?
<Demon>(raises her hand up half way then puts it back down)
::Then the screen lights up and a little Sasami appears in a grim reaper costume::
<Chris&Uhsaw>(Walk off stage and out of the theater into the projection room)
<The Grim Sasami>You are now dead
	
	I dont want to be sued,that would be bad,Tenchi belongs to Pioneer,I am but
a servant to their greatness!

<Jimmy>I'm already scared!
<Hunter>(covering his eyes)Ahhh the greatness,it burns,it burns!
 
			"One Fine Day"
		        By Harry Larry

<Psyco>It doesnt seem that bad.
<Demon>(Sings)OnE FiNe DAy Im GoNnA mAkE yOu MiNe!!!
<Jimmy>(covers his ears)Psyco,you were saying?

			Note:This is a very dark fic,there is death and mature subject matter
You have been warned!

<Demon>(as neighbor lady)Is'nt that lovely now..would like a cookie?

		It was a dark and gloomy day at the Masaki home.

<Hunter>(looks towards heaven and starts singing like a quoir girl)Hallelujah!Hallelujah!
<Demon>(wipes a tear from her eye)Finally the real world has hit the Masaki home...
<Jimmy>Whats next,is Ryoko going to carry Yosho's child?

		The rain poured down in torrents,bouncing off of a lifeless body lying in a 
woodland path.Ryouko lay there,unmoving,showing no signs of life,but her thoughts kept racing back to
the events that happened earlier that day.
			*Flashback*
<Psyco>(as Grandpa Flowerchild)Well I was at woodstock and I got so stoned 
that I thought your grandmother looked good..hehe thats why I married her the next day.
<Demon>(as Lil DogFlower)Wow grandpa...you were a hippy?
<Psyco>Hell no,I was a politition
<Jimmy&Hunter)O.o

	"Ryouko,go away and I never want to see you again!"were the words that her beloved Tenchi had told her.
She didnt mean to break his mother's headstone,she really didnt.With the look of rejection on her face,the 
spacepirate did the only thing she could do,

<Jimmy>Go get an army of vampires and destroy the world?

She ran.She ran as fast as she could then when her lungs were about to blow,she flew the rest of the way.

<Jimmy>That was my second guess...

The other thing she remembered was the image,the image of the slashing monster who was after her beloved Tenchi.
Even with animosity in her heart,she still loved Tenchi and she would still give her life for him,even to the monster that
stood in front of her.It had eyes of burning embers,three rows of fangs and

<Hunter>Buns of steel..

claws made for ripping into the masts of ships."Kill Tenchi!"were the only words it muttered as Ryouko jumped the beast.
She felt it slash into her tender flesh,ripping her apart,tearing her heart out but never dismembering her love for Tenchi.
As she stood there,struggling to stand and holding her entrails in with one hand,the beast hobbled off,leaving her there,stiff with
pain and fear.

<Hunter>Hehe she got a stiffy...
<Demon>(blows her nose on a tissue and smacks him)You pig...
<Jimmy>(wipes some tears from his eyes)Yeah,Hunter dont you have any respect?
<Psyco>For the dead?

Knowing deep down that the beast was heading for Tenchi's house,she half ran and half staggered,trying to get to
the place she had learned to call home.Then just a few steps away from the front yard,she collapsed.The pain would allow her to continue
no farther.Then as the demon shed a tear of defeat,the rain began to pour down,leaving her lying there sodden.Inside of the house,Tenchi 
began to get worried about Ryouko,so he grabbed his rain coat and umbrella and ran out into the storm.

<Hunter>Im singing in the rain!Lalalala

After a few moments he spotted her lifeless body,whisps of breath still leaving her now purple lips.
"Ryouko,talk to me!"Tenchi cried as Ryouko tried to utter out a warning of the monster,but to Tenchi's horror
she gurgled up blood and closed her eyes.Then as Tenchi spied the gapping wound in her stomach he heard a rumbling sound in the bushes.
"Why didnt I bring Tenchi-ken?"He thought as he caught site of a long,scaley tail.

<Jimmy>Look Psyco,your mamas in the bush!
<Hunter>Thats not Jimmy's mom..
<Psyco>(raises a brow)How do you know?
<Hunter>Hehe I have my ways...
<Demon>O.o

Then the monster leapt out.Ryouko could do nothig but lay there and listen to Tenchi's cries for help as the monster tore him apart.
Then as one last tear fell from her face,Tenchi's blood splattered on her body,and her body heat slowley drained out of her,leaving her dead.
Tenchi's now newly dead remains fell ontop of her in a loving,final,embrace.Then the rain stopped and the crunching of leaves could be heard 
approaching the Masaki house.The monster's job was not done.

<Jimmy>(as Shaft)Hehe whos the coolest?
<Demon>Beast!
<Jimmy>Your god-damn right...
<Demon>Beast!
<Psyco>Shut yo mouth..
<Demon>I was just talking about Beast...

                             Fin

<Psyco>Theres a mermaid in this story?
<Demon>And you were dropped on your head right?
::Then the screen goes dark and the crew walk out of the theater,disgusted looks on their faces::
<Uhsaw>How did you like the fic,chidlins?
<Demon>You are a sick,sick,man...
<Chris>Was it dark enough?
<Jimmy>It was depressing...
<Psyco>No comment...
::Jimmy,Demon,Hunter and Psyco walk over to the ship's pay phones::
<Demon>Hello?Spike?I just wanted to tell you that I love you...(crys)
<Jimmy>Syllia?I love you...(looks around)Snooky bear
<Psyco>Mommy,I wuv you!Please dont hang...damn...(puts the phone back on the hook)
<Hunter>Nagi,I know we have some bad history but lets make a mends,Ohh Tonya

<Uhsaw>(crys)I wish my mother was here right now...I want to tell her I love her...
<Chris>Did she die?
<Uhsaw>No..I put her in a home...
<Everyone except Uhsaw>O.O
<Uhsaw>Now everyone get your depressed asses to bed!
::with tears still in their eyes the crew split up and go to there sleeping quarters::
<Chris>Goodnight and God bless!
