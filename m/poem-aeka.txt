Aeka

To love, and be loved.
I want to feel it.
I want to reach out
And know you're there.

Why can't I say
"I love you"?
Why can't I shatter
this window to your world?

To love and be loved.
Is it too far to go?
Do I ask too much?
Do I fear to tread? 

I want to join you.
I want to see you smile,
with love lighting your eyes.

I want to know what it is,
To love and be loved.

Well, I just wanted to write a poem from Aeka's point of view.
She's a much-slandered character, and even the creators don't often
give her a break.
