Author's note:  I do not own Tenchi Muyo, though there is one character
I wish I could call mine forever... *ahem* anyway, AIC/Pioneer owns the
rights to the series.  I also do not own the rights to "Two Princes" by
the Spin Doctors.  That would be whoever wrote the original song and
music, most likely Chris Barron.  Well, here we go...

Two Princes (of Jurai)

Yeah... one-two... princes here before you.  They’re from Jurai now.
Princes... princes who adore you.  But I don’t know why now.
One has a father who’s a king but he’s your dad too now.
This one... can form the Lighthawk Wings but don’t know how to now.
Yeah yeah yeah.  *scatting*
This one’s got the Master Key, yeah.  But he can‘t use one.
A nervous little girl magnet is he, yeah, and he can‘t choose one.
You love Yosho, but he don‘t look like he used to.  Is he too old now?
You love Tenchi, but are you sure that he loves you?  You sure are bold
now.
Marry one or the other.  The one that you were supposed to is your
half-brother,
You’ve got the same father but a different mother and I know what you‘d
do if you had your druthers...
I know what you‘d do if you had your druthers, you‘d...

Want to call each one your lover.  Ain’t that right now?
And there‘s no reason to cover your secret plight now.
You have to talk to them about it.  Come on your highness.
Be truthful, then they will not doubt it.  Forget your shyness.

*instrument break*

Said, one-two... princes here before you.  Which will you choose now?
Princes who you wish would adore you.  Which will you lose now?
One has already had a wife now.  Is he spoiled for you, child?
This one... hasn‘t really lived his life now.  But his friend is too
wild.
Marry one or the other.  The one that you were supposed to is your
half-brother,
You’ve got the same father but a different mother and I know what you‘d
do if you had your druthers...
I know what you‘d do if you had your druthers, you‘d...

Want to call each one your lover.  Ain’t that right now?
And there‘s no reason to cover your secret plight now.
You have to talk to them about it.  Come on your highness.
Be truthful, then they will not doubt it.  Forget your shyness.
You’d like to call each one your lover.  Ain’t that right now?
And there‘s no reason to cover your secret plight now.
You have to talk to them about it.  Come on your highness.
Be truthful, then they will not doubt it.  Forget your shyness.
You’d like to call each one your lover.  Ain’t that right now?
And there‘s no reason to cover your secret plight now.
You have to talk to them about it.  Come on your highness.
Be truthful, then they will not doubt it.  Forget your shyness.
Whoa-oa-oa, Ayeka!  Just make your choice now.
Whoa-oa-oa.  Just... just make your choice now.  (Just make your choice
now)
Whoa-oa-oa, your majesty.  (Just make your choice now)
Come on, forget your shyness now, yeah.  (Just make your choice now)
Come on, come on, come on and (Just make your choice now) make your
choice now.
Yeah... (Just make your choice now)
Yeah, you have to tell them about it.  (Just make your choice now)
Yeah, just make your choice now princess, whoa.  (Just make your choice
now)
(fade out)

I hope you enjoyed that little outing.  It's my first experience
parodying a full song (though I've had other non-Tenchi-related ideas
before).  Just send C&C to the e-mail address that rests next to my
name above the link you clicked to get you here...
