THE TOP 10 THINGS TO DO WHEN RYOKO INVADES YOUR HOUSE



10. Bow down to her and say, "Finish me quickly."

9. Hide in the shadows, then jump out and make cow impressions.

8. Hide in the shadows, then jump out and make sheep impressions.

7. Hope that she doesn't find your secret stash of Tenchi voodoo dolls.

6. Show her a picture of Ayeka and hope that she runs away in fright.

5. Tell her you have a radioactive clone of Ryo-ohki and that you're not afraid 
to use it.

4. Make a false promise that you'll hook her up with Tenchi the next day if she 
leaves you alive.

3. Pretend that you have a safe full of money, lead her to Yagami's exhaust 
pipe, and ask Kiyone to turn the boosters on.

2. Ask Mihoshi to confuse Ryo-ohki's programming. [You're saying, "Ryo-ohki has 
no programming, since she's alive. Well, if Mihoshi's involved, she can do it, I 
promise]

1. Threaten her by telling her that Tenchi is hiding under your bed and ready to 
"do it" with you (whatever gender you are) tonight unless she gets out.




Ha. Yeah, yeah. It was kind of stupid, but that's ok. ^_^;
