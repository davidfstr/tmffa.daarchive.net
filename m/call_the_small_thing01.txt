it the other way round this time.
Blink 182 wrote 'All The Small Things'

NOTES: Well, The Eraser certainly did
for me this time! It's a brilliant song,
no denying it, but bloody 'ell is it 
difficult to parody. There aren't enough
words, really. And it's very bad butchering
a good song...unlike doing a D12 one
hehehe...so unfortunatly this
may well be the most pathetic parody I've 
ever done. It's is performed by Yosho who, 
in rock vein, is proclaiming his love for the
cutest genius in the universe- Lil' Washu!

Call the Small Thing
(who I love)

Stop there , young one
Grow up, have fun
You can, shake dew
Off me, and off you
So many years, trapped up
You'll be, wrapped up
Testing, deducing, maybe seducing
Tonight you won't though, our love with flow,
a prince I may be, but I want to roam

Na, na

Shrine work, come home
But I'm not, so low
She left her jewels of tonight
But her eyes still let me see the light 
I can change this old face, we'll still go 
to a young place, 
Never let it stop, I've found my home

Na, na

Say it's release, no nurse clothes please 
Bring back your emotions, and see how you've grown
They may hurt you, but I will wash you, 
my little Washu
Say you love me, not little Tenchi, turn the lab off, 
your not alone
The kings may boss you, but they won't crush you, 
our love continues, 
my little Washu

THE END

Well, what did I tell you?
Rubbish. And if it wasn't for the fact that
me and Ian have this compo going, I would
get him to 'Earase' it from history. But long
live the TMFFA- despite all the trash I put
on it.
Yrs.
