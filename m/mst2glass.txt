“CROOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!”
“Not bad, Servo, try it again,” said the golden headed drone.
“CRRRROOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!”
“Hey, guys, what’s up?” said our favorite temp janitor/astronaut,
Mike Nelson.
“Crow and I were auditioning for a part in the movie Star Trek
II,” said Tom Servo.
“Yeah, it’s gonna be really, really cool. We’ll get to travel to
strange planets and meet alien women!” Crow said.
“Uhhh, guys, that movie was filmed over ten years ago...” Mike
said.
The bots just stood there. Crow spoke first. “Mike, we’re going
to go kill William Shatner, ok?”
“Whatever, Crow, but you’d have to get to Earth first.”
“Oh, ok. We aren’t going to go kill him.”
“That’s better.”

The light signaling transmissions from Deep 13 came on.
DEEP 13
(Dr. Forrester appears, looking horribly mutilated)
“Hello, my soon-to-be insane experiments!”

SOL
“Hi, Dr. F,” all three replied.

DEEP 13
“Well, as promised, I have a horribly improbable lemon for you
today! Frank would say hi, but he’s staying in his cage until he
stops becoming a werewolf. But first, the invention exchange. You
may go first,” he said.

SOL
“Here, we have what appears to be an ordinary chocolate bar,”
Mike said, holding up what appeared to be an ordinary chocolate
bar. 
“When eaten, it causes a temporary state of sensory deprivation,
causing the user to go both deaf and blind for a period of two
hours!”

DEEP 13 
Dr. Forrester stood horrified for a moment, then said, “Which
would allow them to sit through an intolerable movie or fanfic
with no discomfort whatsoever? NO! I’m sending the lemon up now,
unedited, uncut, unchangeable! Your spirit will be broken TODAY,
Nelson! DIE!” He presses the transmit button.

SOL 
“Good going, Mike,” the bots said in unison, “now you’ve pissed
him off!”
“Uh-oh,” Mike said.
“We’ve got Fanfic sign!!”

>To: ffml@fanfic.com
>From: Doug Whiddon <doug_w@mail.geocities.com>
CROW: (looking at Mike, who is furiously writing on a piece of
paper) What are you doing?
MIKE: Making a note of who’s responsible.
>Subject: [FFML] [Tenchi][Lemon] untitled



>I wrote this awhile back, I wrote it in a spiral notebook first.
The
>problem is I can't stand going back and retyping something I
already wrote,
TOM: So does this mean no story... no? Damn.

>I'd rather write something new, so this is half of what I wrote.
I've
>pretty much abandoned this whole project, so here's what I have.
CROW: Don’t give us false hopes...

>This story pick up where "The Price one Pays" leaves off
>I didn't write "The Price one Pays"  and I don't own Tenchi
MIKE: I think we’re going to be well informed about “the price
one pays”
>or any associated characters 

>	Ayeka snuggled against Tenchi's chest and sighed
>happily.  Tenchi, however, could not sleep. 
CROW: He was too busy looking at...
MIKE: Crow, don’t.
CROW: The stars! I was gonna say the stars.
MIKE: Good.
> For the last
>few minutes an odd feeling had been building in his gut. 
TOM: YES! THE CHESTBURSTER SCENE IS UPON US!
CROW: Yeah, right, then the lemon would be over...
>He was still hungry, but this was something different.
>	Tenchi's life was weird enough that he knew better
>than to ignore a feeling like this.
MIKE: So if his life were normal, he would ignore it, huh?

>	"Better have a look around" he thought.
CROW: A look around what?
TOM: DON’T PUSH IT, CROW!
>	Tenchi detangled himself from Ayeka's grasp and
>climbed out of bed.
MIKE: And a dangerous climb it was...
>	"Tenchi...?" Ayeka sat up on bed, the sheet pressed
>to her chest.  It clung to her body, damp from their
>lovemaking, like a second skin. 
ALL: O_O
> For a moment Tenchi
>forgot why he had gotten out of bed, struck by an almost
>irresistible urge to climb back into her arms.
MIKE: Resist... please...
CROW: <borg voice> RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.
>	Tenchi snapped himself out of it "I'll be back in a
>few minutes, Ayeka"
TOM: Oooh, sentence fragments...
>	"Hurry back, my love." Ayeka whispered.
>	Tenchi pulled on his loose pants and a clean shirt
>and slipped out of the door.  Tenchi looked in on Sasami,
>who was sleeping peacefully, 
CROW: But not for long, heh heh...
MIKE: (thinking) One more, Crow, one more...
>he moved down the hall and
>peeked into Mihoshi's room, Mihoshi never had trouble
>sleeping through anything.
CROW: Tenchi knew this, beca-
MIKE: <James belushi> NO MORE!
(Mike backhands Crow, sending the Robot’s head bouncing towards
the back of the theater.)
CROW’S HEAD: (while his body finds him) Yeah, Nelson, well, screw
you too!
>  The last room down the hall
>was washuu's (and sometimes Ryoko's)
TOM: Lesbian sex!
MIKE: Don’t you start too...
>	"Do you need something Tenchi?" Washuu was still
>working despite the late hour.
CROW:  <Tenchi> Well, I was wondering if you still needed that
sample...
TOM: Doesn’t Washu work in her LAB?
MIKE: Smile and nod...
>	"have you seen Ryoko?"
TOM: <Tenchi> Y’know! The demoness! Big hair, blows stuff up...
>	"She's probably on her perch over the living room."
>	"Okay, thanks."
>	 Tenchi walked quietly 
ALL:(Buffalo stampede noises)
>back down the hall, he
>stopped in front of his room and peeked in.  Ayeka was
>sleeping peacefully, the light from the full moon 
TOM: Eww! Nobody wants to see that!
>outside his
>window shined around her head, 
CROW: Horribly burning her to a crisp, ending the fic.
MIKE: Boy, you’re dark today.
CROW: Join the dark side, Mike.
>giving her an angelic
>appearance. Tenchi closed the door and walked downstairs.
>	Ryoko was nowhere to be seen, her usual perch was
>bare and she was not on the couch, Tenchi looked into the
>kitchen and out the back door.
TOM: Must.. not.... pass..out..
CROW: Knock it off, Servo. That had commas.
>  Still no Ryoko.
ALL: Ryoko no BAKA!
>	Tenchi slipped on his shoes in the doorway and
>stepped outside.  The odd feeling seemed to get stronger as
>he headed out over the bridge, 
CROW: He’s using (looks at Mike).. uh, his... y’know... to find
Ryoko?
>he heard a sound from the
>trees,
TOM: Sex with trees? This is bizarre!!
> and realized that what he had been feeling was a
>building misery.  
MIKE: I suggest you pass on this one, Crow.
CROW: Gotcha.
>For there, huddled under a large tree, sat
>Ryoko, her body shook as tears streamed down her cheeks.
TOM: I guess they were BIG tears.
>	One time before Tenchi had felt Ryoko call out to
>him, when the being called Zero had captured her.  But 
>this was more acute,  they seemed to have some sort of
>empathic bond.
MIKE: Better grip than Superglue!
>	Tenchi stepped up to her and kneeled down beside
>her 
CROW: Shouldn’t that be the other way around?
>"Ryoko...?" he said softly placing a  hand on her
>shoulder.
TOM: Whose hand was it?
MIKE: And did they miss it?
>	Ryoko's head snapped up 
CROW: Breaking her neck and killing her instantly. The end.
TOM: That was dark...
>"Tenchi..."
>	"What's wrong Ryoko?"
>	Ryoko struggled with the words but finally she
MIKE: Kicked their asses!
> was
>able to speak "You love Ayeka, not me."
TOM: <Tenchi> Sh**! She figured it out!
>	Tenchi should have known, he put his hand on
>Ryoko's shoulder.
 MIKE: Again...
>"Ryoko, I do love Ayeka..."
CROW: Oh, good, go with the answer that would normally get you
killed...
>	Ryoko's misery deepened

>	"But I love you just as much."
TOM: Did you see that coming?
CROW: <homer simpson> I had no idea!
>	Ryoko stopped shaking, her head rose slowly, 
>until her tear streaked face and red eyes where level with
>Tenchi's face.
TOM: That might be tough, considering...
MIKE: Come on, Tom. This isn’t that bad.
>  Her voice shook "D-do you really mean that
>Tenchi?"
>	Tenchi started to speak, but kissed Ryoko lightly
>instead.
CROW: That boy ain’t right...
>	Ryoko's face brightened noticeably.
ALL: I’M BLIND!
>	Tenchi suddenly found himself lying under Ryoko
>on the cool grass
TOM: Those earthquakes can happen at any time, huh?
MIKE: No, only when the author needs the characters on the
ground, right then.
CROW: Oh, ok.
>	<What the...> Tenchi was a little surprised, Ryoko
>pressed herself firmly against Tenchi's chest and covered
>his face in kisses.
TOM: Exactly WHY is this surprising?
MIKE: Accept it. Be one with the fanfic.
>	Tenchi was a little overwhelmed but quickly
>responded in kind.
TOM: We don’t need yer KIND, round here, laddie!!
>	Ryoko pulled off Tenchi's shirt and began lightly
>kissing her way down his chest, loosening her clothing as
>she went.
CROW: Fast hands, quick sex, massive...
MIKE and TOM: (who are both leveling large weapons his way) Want
to continue?
CROW: No...
>	Tenchi lay back and let Ryoko have her way with
>him.
TOM: So Ryoko’s Sinatra now?
>	Ryoko pulled Tenchi's pants off and tossed them
>aside.  Tenchi was a little nervous, Ayeka had been much
>more sedate and methodical,
CROW: <Ayeka> Step one, remove clothing, step two, (sees the
others reaching for the weapons) put clothes back on...
> Ryoko however seemed to
>want to devour him.  (Speaking of which) Ryoko was
>bobbing up and down between his thighs.
TOM: This better not be a Bobbit rip-off... (realizes what he
said)... ughhh. I’m gonna be sick...
>	<This feels incredible> Tenchi felt more relaxed
>than he ever had.  He realized that if she kept this up much
>longer he was going to explode, 
MIKE: Well, at least that would look cool...
>and he doubted he could
>go for a third round tonight.
TOM: <crusty ring announcer> Da champ is looking impotent, Crow!
CROW: He’s gotten soft, Tom!
MIKE: Ewww!
>	Tenchi grabbed Ryoko's arms and pulled her up
>level with him, Kissing her deeply he rolled over, laying
>Ryoko out on the soft grass.  Tenchi began to stroke
>Ryoko's thighs with his hand as he began to lightly kiss
>Ryoko, starting with her neck and shoulders and working
>his way down kissing and licking every exposed inch of her
>sweet flesh.  
ALL: O_o (no one speaks, just look on in horror)
>	Tenchi rubbed his palms against Ryoko's breasts,
>marveling at how soft and firm they where, Washuu may
>joke about Ryoko's breasts sagging, but every inch of her
>was just as tight and firm as it could be. Ryoko's nipples
>became hard under Tenchi's palms.  Tenchi brought his
>mouth to one of Ryoko's breasts and began to suck gently. 
>Ryoko tipped her head back and moaned loudly, and
>wrapped her arms around Tenchi's head.  Tenchi flicked his
>tongue over her nipple.
TOM: (stress gets to him) HE’S OUT OF CHARACTER!! HE’S OUT OF
CHARACTER!! HE’S-(dome explodes, spewing assorted robot bits)
>	Tenchi  moved down Ryoko torso heading down
>towards her groin.  Tenchi licked around the rim of Ryoko's
>belly button.  Finally he arrived at her sex.  Ryoko's
>breathing became slightly tough as Tenchi began to kiss her
>inner thighs, moving inward slowly.  He came to her lips,
>slightly open and glistening.  Tenchi breathed in her scent. 
>He began to lick along the edge of her sex  and to flick his
>tongue against her clit.
CROW: (whispering) Remember your training...remember your
training...
MIKE: (calmly, under the circumstances) GYPSY!!! ACTIVATE ESCAPE
PROGRAM 212Q!
The projection screen catches fire and Mike picks up the bots and
sprints out of the theater.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------
“OH, Thank God...” Tom says, as Mike screws on his dome and fills
it with insulator.
“I think that was worth the plan to escape...” Crow pipes in.
“But the projection screen is easily fixed, lab rats,” Dr. F.
said! 
“NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!”
------------------------------------------------------
>(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)
CROW: Don’t worry, Mike, we’ll kill you if it comes to that...
>	"Aaaaaaaah!!!' Ayeka's scream pierced the morning.
TOM: The morning had a good lawyer and decided to sue their asses
off.
>	Tenchi awoke instantly "What! What, is it, who
>screamed.
MIKE: I guess the total disregard of punctuation will be observed
for the rest of the fanfic..
>" Tenchi was somewhat less than coherent.
CROW: He fell apart often.
>	Ayeka was standing on the bed, naked. "Wha...
>what is she doing here!?" Ayeka pointed accusingly at
>Ryoko.
TOM: <Tenchi> Well, Geez, who couldn’t use a little bit of
lesbian action about now?
>	"I could ask the same about you princess." Ryoko
>sat up in bed and stretched. since she was naked this was
>quite a sight.
CROW: Stretch marks!!
MIKE: Crow, please don’t go there....
> "Tenchi; where are my clothes?"
TOM: Not on you, obviously!
>	"They're probably still out by the tree."
>	Ryoko stepped over Tenchi and walked out the
>door. 
MIKE: She does have her powers, right? Why not teleport there?
TOM: Hey, you said no nitpicking!
>Tenchi stared at her retreating form.
>	The temperature in the room dropped noticeably.
CROW: Aha! So she IS the “Ice Queen!”
>Avoiding Ayeka's gaze Tenchi rolled up his futon and slid
>it back under his bed. Finally her turned to face her.
>Ayeka's expression caused Tenchi to recall his first
>encounter with dry ice; hard to imagine something cold
>enough to burn. "Ayeka?"
CROW: Told ya.
>	Ayeka turned away from him and spoke in careful
>measured tones. "Jurian customs allow multiple people to
>marry, and if Ryoko is your choice for second wife; then
>that is something I will just have to get used to. However;
>in the future I would appreciate waking up next to the same
>person I went to bed with." 
TOM: <Tenchi> hehehe... You did.
MIKE: (fingers in ears) Not listening...
>Ayeka gathered her robe and
>left the room.
>	Tenchi leaned back against his bed and sighed. "I
>think I need a bigger bed."
CROW: In fact, I need a whole new bedroom set!!!

>	"A bigger bed?" Washuu's head poked up from
>behind her terminal. "And just what would you need a
>bigger bed for? Hmmm?" Washuu had an almost evil glint
>in her eye.
TOM: Because I’m GETTIN’ SOME!
>	"Mine's only big enough for two." Tenchi blushed
>slightly at the thought of sharing his bed with Ayeka and
>Ryoko.
MIKE: *Slightly*? He’d be dead from the nosebleeds!
>	"All right, It'll be there by lunch time. Now beat it,
CROW: (opens beak)
MIKE: (candidly) The SOL could use a bidet, don’t you think so,
Crow?
CROW: (clamps it shut)
> I have work to do."
>	Tenchi bowed deeply. "Thank you, little Washuu."
>Tenchi turned and left the lab; he bumped into Ayeka on
>the way out, literally.
TOM:  How else do you... ah, screw it.
>	"Oh, Tenchi, excuse me."
>	Tenchi helped Ayeka to her feet. "Ayeka, I was just
>about to go looking for you."
>	"Oh? What did you want?"
CROW: Isn’t it obvious?
MIKE: TOO MUCH SO! (hogties crow)
>	"I though we should talk about last night,...and this
>morning." Tenchi searched for his next words. 
TOM: But they were nowhere to be found.
>There where
>so many things he wanted to say. "Ayeka, why don't we go
>on a picnic for lunch; that way we can spend some time
>together and talk about things."
>	Ayeka's face brightened. "You mean just you and I?
>What about Ryoko?"
>	"I'll deal with Ryoko, don't worry. 
CROW: MMpthehrhr!
MIKE: I’m glad I didn’t have to hear that.
>Why don't you go
>and see if you can talk Sasami into fixing us a picnic lunch;
>okay?"
>	Ayeka nodded. "Alright."
>	Tenchi went off to find Ryoko who had been
>curiosly absent since breakfast.
TOM: Most illogical.

>(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)
MIKE: Somebody is way too happy today.
TOM: yep.
>	"A picnic? Really?" Sasami seemed excited by the
>prospect.
>	"Yes, for Tenchi and I.” Ayeka smiled at the
>thought of having Tenchi all to herself for an afternoon.
MIKE: I, personally, retch at the thought.
>	“Let’s see, Tenchi’s father is away for the weekend,
>so that means just six of us...” The ‘Tenchi and I’ part of
>Ayeka’s speech had aparently gone over her head.
>	“Uh, Sasami, I meant a picnic just for Tenchi and I,
>not the whole family.
>	Sasami stopped short. “You and Tenchi? Alone?
>Ryoko will never let you get away withit.”
>	Ayeka fumed. 
CROW: She has gas problems, I see..
MIKE: How in the world did you get out of that?
CROW: Uh, dumb luck?
>“Tenchi will deal with Ryoko, he
>promised.”
>	“Okay. Hey, where you last night? Hm?” Sasmai
>grinned at Ayeka. “And why did I see Ryoko walking
>naked out of Tenchi’s room this morning?”
TOM: She does that at some point EVERY day...

>	Ayeka’s entire body went through three shades of
>red. “Sasami you are far to young to be thinking about such
>things.”
MIKE: Ayeka’s the embarrassed one, and she’s telling SASAMI that
she’s too young?
>	“Allright, but eventually you are going to tell me
>everything. Oh, and don’t forget to save the sheet of
>Tenchi’s bed.”
>	Confusion reigned. “His sheet? What for?”
CROW: Because the ancient Jurians were PANTY RAIDERS!!!
>	“Tradition.” Sasami  turned from Ayeka and
>continued working in the kitchen.
CROW: I’m a psychic!
>Meanwhile.

>	Tenchi found Ryoko on her usual perch over the
>living room, she had a bottle of saki in front of her and
>Tenchi’s gameboy in hand.
>	“Ryoko.”
>	Ryoko looked down at him. “Tenchi!” She
>disapeared from her perch and reapeared wrapping herself
>around Tenchi in mid-air.
MIKE: That sounds hard to do.
TOM: For Ryoko? Nahhhh...
> She proceeded to pull him into a
>deep kiss. 
CROW: IT’S A BLACK HOLE KISS! 
>The tail of Ryokos outfit drew lazy circles in the
>air as they explored each others mouths with their tounges.
>Ryoko pulled away from him. “Why don’t we go back to
>your room and...”
>	“Ryoko, we dont have time for that.”
>	“So we miss breakfast, if you want something to
>nibble on....” Ryoko let Tenchi’s mind fill in the blanks.
TOM: <Tenchi> You’ve got watermelon in your room?
>	Tenchi extracted himself from Ryoko’s embrace.
>“Ryoko, will you please listen to me!”
>	Ryoko floated back to the ground.
>	“I told Ayeka that she and I would have a picnic
>lunch so we could talk. I need you to promise that you
>won’t interfere, okay?”
>	“You and Ayeka? Alone?”
>	Tenchi nodded.
>	“Allright, but later you have to do something with
>me, okay?”
CROW: Say no more...(nudge nudge)
>	“Sounds fair.”


>(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)(^_^)
MIKE: Oh look! Happiness! 
>Here is one more little scene, (no connection)
TOM: Useful plot device, that...
CROW: I smell varmaint poon-tang!
MIKE: If anybody gets that it’s gonna be a miracle....

>	The rain was coming down in a near flood. Tenchi
>and Ayeka where inside the small cabin between the
>temple and the house.
>	"Why do feel like we've done this before" Tenchi
>built a small fire in the metal box on the floor.
TOM: Maybe because... YOU HAVE!!!!!!!
MIKE: Almost there, Tom. Don’t blow it.
>	Ayeka laughed, "we have remember?"
>	"How could I forget" *it was the first time I held
>you in my arms*. Tenchi wrung out his shirt and hung it on
>a nail, he took of his shoes and socks and lay them against
>the wall. When he turned around Ayeka was laying her
>multilayered garment on the bench against the wall.
CROW: Jurian multilayered garments. Don’t leave home without
them.
>	Ayeka lay out each wet garment on the bench to
>dry. When she was done there was no room to sit on the
>bench. 
TOM: So she sat on the roof.
>She walked to the end of the small cabin and from a
>cardboard box produced a sleeping mat and blankets,
>which she lay out on the floor in front of the fire.
MIKE: I have a real bad feeling here....
>	Tenchi watched Ayeka lay out the mat; he hadn't
>known there was one there. He couldn't think of any reason
>for one to be there, but then again, why question a good
>thing.
TOM: It’s tough to question anything without question marks...
>	"Come on, sit next to me." Ayeka patted the mat
>next to her.
>	"My pants are too wet."
CROW: <Tenchi> I pissed myself. Hehee!
>	Ayeka stood up and faced Tenchi, "take them off."
>	"I'm not wearing anything underneath, I'll just go
>stand outside."
MIKE: With no pants on, no less!
>	Ayeka moved between Tenchi and the door. "It's
>raining to hard to be out there." Ayeka kissed Tenchi. "I
>want you to stay with me." She put her arms around
>Tenchi.
>	Tenchi tried to pull away "Ayeka, I cant...."
CROW: I’m allergic!
>	Ayeka caught his belt-loops with one hand and
>touched his lips with her forefinger. "Shh. I know you don't
>want to choose; and I'm not asking you to. 
TOM: You’re getting some RIGHT NOW!
>I just want you
>to give me some time." Ayeka kissed Tenchi, pushing him
>against the wall. She pulled open the front of his jeans and
>reached inside them.
CROW: Lots of space.
>	"Ayeka, please. What if Ryoko finds out?"
>	"Ryoko said I could go first."
MIKE: You did. It’s time to share.
TOM: You’re getting hentai, Mike...
>	Ayeka's tongue slipped into Tenchi's mouth. This
>combined with her hands in his jeans short circuited his
>brain. 
CROW: His head exploded and this was all over...
>He began to return the kiss.
>	Ayeka broke of the kiss and pulled Tenchi's jeans
>off. She stepped back and looked him over. His body was
>slim and Lithe, his chest was smooth. His torso was well
>defined, a testament to his martial arts training. 
MIKE: She didn’t notice all this before?
TOM: Smile and nod...
>Ayeka felt
>a dampness that had nothing to do with the rain.
CROW: Uh, Mike, I’m not feeling too good...
>	Tenchi turned red and glanced down at himself;
>making sure he hadn't grown any extra parts that were
>making Ayeka stare so long.
TOM: He.. he’s gone Overfiend!
>	Ayeka removed her innermost garment and lay it on
>the bench with the others. She stood before him naked,
>only her key on her forehead.
MIKE: (nearly delirious) Sounds like it hurts...
>	Now it was Tenchi who stared. Ayeka was thin and
>pale, her breast where the proverbial handful with rosy pink
>nipples. Her stomach was flat, legs long and smooth.
>Tenchi's eyes where drawn to the curly hairs between her
>legs. her hair color was apparently natural.
CROW: *Burp* Not good....
>	Ayeka put her arms around Tenchi, pressing her breasts into
>his chest. She looked into his eyes. "Tenchi...."
MIKE: (downing the ordinary looking chocolate bar, and smiling as
he goes blind and deaf) Last night....
BOTS: Damn you, NELSOOOOOONNNNN!!!!!
>	Tenchi kissed Ayeka. He ran his hands down her back and
>over her rear, her skin was smooth and soft. He guided her down
>onto the mat, her nipples where hard against his chest. He ended
>their kiss, his mouth found her ear lobe. He nibbled softly.
CROW: Grrrahh!
> His right
>hand slid down her side, over the curve of her hip and down her
>leg. His left arm supported her. He kissed her cheek and the
side of
>her neck. He tickled the skin on the back of her knees.
TOM: Now that’s great foreplay! Knee tickling!
>	Ayeka reveled in the sensations Tenchi was evoking in her,
>after so much time he was hers. But she felt a small amount of
guilt.
CROW: O THE SHAME!
>Her education on Jurai had included several text on lovemaking.
>For nobles it was a skill to be learned, not so much something
done
>on instinct. At the least a theoretical knowledge was expected.
She
>had saved herself for Yosho, so her practical experience was
non-
>existent. All her Jurian teachings said it was her
responsibility to
>please her partner.
>	Of course, this was earth....
TOM: So you satisfy yourself and don’t care about the other guy.
Sounds like one of Mike’s girlfriends.. heh heh.
CROW: He can’t hear you, Servo...
TOM: Damn.
>	Tenchi flicked his tongue across one of her nipples, her
>breasts where extremely sensitive.
>	....And heaven, she concluded.
>	Ayeka wrapped her arms around Tenchi's neck. 
>	Tenchi's right hand slid along her inside thigh, along her
>abdomen and up to her breasts.  He held her left breast in his
palm,
>squeezing gently.
>	Tenchi lowered Ayeka to the mat. He began to kiss her,
>starting just below her breasts, he kissed her lightly down to
the
>valley between her legs. He felt like he was going to explode.
>	Tenchi's toungue brushed Ayeka's clit, sending shockwaves
>up and down her spine, her back arched as she came. Ayeka's
hands
>pressed Tecnhi's head into her sex.
BOTS: OH GOD! (can only sit in horror)
>	Ayeka realesed Tecnhi's head and lay back as the force of
>her orgasm subsided.
MIKE: (still blind and deaf) Heh, glad I can’t see what’s about
to happen...
>	Tenchi gently spread open the lips of Ayeka's sex and slid
in
>up to the hilt.
TOM: NO! NOT THE SWORD! ANYTHING BUT THAT! (goes catatonic)
>	Ayeka sighed as her clit hit the base of Tenchi's cock.
>	Tenchi began to thrust in and out.
CROW: *burp* (throws up into mike’s lap)
MIKE: What the hell just happened here?

-----------------------------------------------------------------
--------------
Two hours later in the lobby
Crow was alternately screaming and puking up month old RAM chips.
He downed a bottle of Rolaids. “It was horrible! There was
thrusting, and, and... oh god...” He then proceeds to throw up
the Rolaids. Servo is sitting in the corner, rocking back and
forth. “The horror...the horror....”

The message light comes on. The bots dive under the counter.

DEEP 13

“Well, is your sprit broken? Will you willingly submit that
chocolate bar now?” Dr. F said with a touch of nervousness.
