Out in space, on the far side of the moon, there is a small 
underground faculty which is home to volumes of horrible fanfictions 
written by authors of equal quality.  Here, Chris Bozeman has been 
sentenced, for undiscussable reasons, to watch and review each fanfic.  
He is joined by several anime characters to help him in his task.
Now, to introduce this session's MSTers
Chris Bozeman:  Me.  To be more specific, I'm the guy stuck in the base 
who runs everything (somewhat).
Vash the Stampede:  He survived the second MST, so he's still here.  
A.K.A the 'humanoid typhoon' he is from his own series, Trigun.
Tenchi:  Well, I'm pretty sure anyone reading knows who he is.  He's 
from Tenchi Muyo (duh).
Sasami:  the second Tenchi Muyo MSTer for this session.
Special guest:  To be announced.

(Everyone is right outside the theater)
Chris:  Alright, today, we'll be viewing yet another fic, but then 
again, only Vash has experience in this area.
Sasami:  Um, I don't feel good, can I stay in the rec room?
Vash:  Um..yea..me too.
Chris:  (sigh)  alright Sasami, but only because I'm not sure whether 
you should see this fic or not.. you stay though, Vash. (Sasami leaves)
Tenchi:  So, who's the special guest?
Chris:  One minute, I have to check. (looks at his chart) ok, who wrote 
'Gohan and Vegeta on my chart?
Tenchi & Vash: (shrug)
Voice:  They didn't put it on there.  We did.
Chris:  That sounds sickeningly familiar.. (looks and sees Vegeta and 
Gohan standing behind him with their arms crossed)  ew.(cringes)
Gohan:  That's right. we're back.
Vash:  But..how?
Vegeta:  You fool!  If your brain functioned properly, you'd know that 
anyone killed from our series is wished back by the dragonballs in a 
matter of days!
Chris:  He's right you know..
Gohan:  And, even though I don't completely go along with the idea, at 
the end of the fic, we're going to blow up this base!
All but Vegeta and Gohan:  Shit!
Gohan and Vegeta:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  On with the fic!
(everyone enters the theater.  Chris starts up the fic.)

>DBZ Muyo

Vegeta:  You fool!  Why are you doing this one??
Chris:  Not my idea.  I don't pick the fics to view.  The government 
does.

>Disclaimer: I do not own any if the Tenchi Muyo or Dragonball Z
characters!  You know the drill!
Vash (as drill sergeant):  That's right girlie-boys!  Repeat after me:  
I do not own any of these characters!
All but Vash:  I do not own any of these characters!
Vash (as drill sergeant):  Someone else owns them!
All but Vash:  Someone else owns them!
Vash (as drill sergeant):  Don't sue me!
All but Vash:  Don't sue me!
Vash (as drill sergeant):  alright, drop and gimme twenty!

>Author's Note:  This is my first crossover fanfic, so that speaks for
itself!

Tenchi:  Why can't a good author write a story about me?

 >Washu's triumphant cackle could be heard throughout the Masaki
house.  She had just

Gohan:  Gotten the 'sample' from Tenchi?
Tenchi:  Please don't..

 >finished another of her inventions.

Tenchi:  Thank god..

>Washu practically ran through the broom closet door.  She pushed it
open so hard, that it slammed into the wall. 

Vash:  .or so she thought, in actuality, Noboyuki had been smashed up 
against the wall by the door.
Chris (as Noboyuki):  Owww. Washu, why did you slam a door into me?
Tenchi:  Speaking of whom, have you seen my dad anywhere recently?
Chris:  Um..

>Everyone was watching a
t.v. program and nearly jumped out of their seats.
 "Everyone to my lab!  I need to show you my newest creation!"

Vegeta (as Ryoko):  You showed it to us yesterday..
Gohan (as Washu):  That was my old newest creation!  This is my NEW 
newest creation!

>Everyone groaned and got up.  Tenchi hung back away from Washu.  She
was still after him to be her guniea pig.

Tenchi:  Sigh...
Vash:  I wouldn't mind being Washu's guinea pig.

>"But it was my favorite show Washu!"  Ryoko complained.  "And I
actually got to sit next to Tenchi!"
 Washu turned to her.  "Ryoko?"
 "What?"  Ryoko said grumpily.
 "Call me mom!"

All:  (blink)
Gohan:  That was rather off the subject.

>Ryoko groaned and continued to follow Washu down to her lab.  They
all crowded around a big machine.
 Sasami looked at the machine, then Washu.  "Is this why you missed
lunch Washu?"

Vash (as Washu):  No, actually, that's why I missed breakfast.
Tenchi:  She misses breakfast no matter what.

>"I missed lunch?  I must've been working so hard that I forgot
about!  I'm sorry Sasami."
 "Don't worry, I saved you some!"
 "Thank you Sasami."
 "What is this thing Little Washu?"  asked Tenchi, clearly wanting to
get out of her lab.

Tenchi: I feel for you.

>"This is my newest invention!  Its called the InterAnime Transporter,
or IAT.  It can transport people from other anime here!"

Chris:  Wait, they know they're in an anime?
All but Chris:  Yea, of course!

>Mihoshi stepped forward to take a good look, but true to her nature,
she tripped. 

Vash:  hehe..silly Mihoshi

>She grabbed part of the IAT for support, accidentally
hitting a big red button.............
 "Mihoshi!"  Washu screamed.
 But the machine started up anyway.  There was a low whirring sound
and a flash of light.  When it was over, there were six more people in
Washu's lab.

Tenchi:  Actually, if Mihoshi was acting true to her nature, the big 
red button would have caused the IAT to self-destruct, decimating half 
the house.
Vegeta:  Ouch.

>"What happened?  Who are you guys?"  a tall blonde guy asked.

Vegeta:  I'll destroy you someday Kakkorot!

 >Washu looked up at him in amazement.  "It worked!  It worked!  I am
*such* a genius!!!!"
 She ran up to him and smiled her little girl smile.  "Hiya!  I'm
Little Washu, the greatest scientific genius in the universe!  You're
cute!  Do you want to be my guniea pig?"  she said, looking him over.
 "Um................."

Chris (as Goku):  no, I'd rather be the correct spelling of guinea pig.
Gohan:  Agreed.

 >"These are my friends!"  Washu continued.  "This is my daughter
Ryoko, Jurian Princess Aeka, her little sister Sasami, Kiyone, my
personal pain in the neck Mihoshi, grandfather Yosho, his son
Noboyuki, Noboyuki's son and my *former* guniea pig Tenchi!"

Tenchi:  (sighs in relief)

>Tenchi let out a sigh of relief.

Vash:  Is there an echo in here?
Tenchi:  Former was the word I wanted to hear.

>Former was the word he had wanted
to hear.

Vash:  I repeat.
Vegeta:  That's just scary.

>"Um......hi.  My  name is Goku.  This is my wife Chi-Chi, our son
Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, and *our* scientist Bulma."
 Washu rushed over to Bulma with gleaming eyes.
 "You're a scientist?  Me too!"
 "Yeah....but aren't you a little young to be the 'greatest scientific
genius in the universe'?  What are you?  11?  12?"
 "No silly!  Like I said, I'm the a genius!  So I can make myself
*appear* young."
 "Oh.....um....okay...."
 "Let's go!"  Washu said grabbing Bulma's wrist and dragging her off
into the lab.
 Ryoko laid her head on Tenchi's shoulder.
 "Just what I need Tenchi!  More women to distract you from me!"
 But at the same time, Tenchi was thinking  <Yes!  More men to
distract her from me!>

Tenchi:  (snort) as if that would work.

 >Aeka did not like this.
 "Ryoko!  Don't bother Lord Tenchi with your foolishness!  Tenchi
obviously loves *me*!"
 "No way little princess!"
 "This is the last time you...you demon! 

Chris:  Nice comeback Ayeka. (holds two thumbs up)
Vegeta:  That has to be the most overly used insult in your series,  
Tenchi. 
Tenchi:  You're one to talk.

 >Never again will you have
the chance to bug Lord Tenchi!"

Vash (as Ryoko version of 'the Fly'):  Heeeeeelllppp meeeeee!!! 
Heeeeeeeelllllllp meeeeeee!!!
Gohan:  I think the author meant 'annoy', Vash.

>Ryoko stepped forward until she was just inches from Aeka.   "Is that
a challenge?"
 "Yeah!"
 Tenchi stepped between the two girls.  "Ryoko!  Aeka!  We have
guests!"
 Ryoko walked turned away from Aeka and said "Your time will come
Princess."  and disappeared.
 "Hmph!"  Aeka said snottily, walking out of the lab.
 "Why don't you go take a walk around the grounds."  Tenchi suggested
to Chi-Chi.  "You could go see the shrine."
 "Or the onsen!"  Noboyuki put in.

Gohan:  That.was not intelligent.
Vash:  Fear the wrath of P.O.ed Chi-Chi!

>Chi-Chi gave him a disgusted look and marched out of the lab.
 Yosho and Noboyuki had to go do their own things at the shrine, so
they too, left.
 Kiyone frowned and slapped her forehead.  "I almost forgot!  Mihoshi
and I have a shift at the diner!  See you guys at dinner!"
 Sasami watched them leave and then smiled at Gohan.  "Do you like
video games Gohan?"
 "Yeah!"

Gohan:  Crap!  Once again, I'm a little kid in a fic.  Oh well, maybe 
by now I'm a super saiyan..

 >"I have a couple upstairs!  Wanna go play 'em?"
 "Sure!"
 "Okay!  Race you!"
 Gohan and Sasami raced out of the lab, Ryoki running behind them.
 This left Tenchi, Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo.
 "Let's get out of here!"  Tenchi said.
 "Okay."  Goku agreed.  "Its creepy in here."

Tenchi:  (shudders)

>"Its creepier when Washu wants you to be her
guniea pig!

Tenchi:  (shudders again)
Chris:  You should see a psychiatrist about that.. it's some pretty 
serious trauma.
Tenchi:  I know..

 >So if I were you, I'd watch out!"
 They sat down in the living room.
 "Do those girls always swarm all over you?"  Goku asked.
 "Yeah."
 "The Ladies Man!"

Tenchi:  Not true..
Gohan:  I doubt my dad even knows who the Ladies Man is..

 >"I wish I weren't!"

Vegeta:  You never were.

>"Oh come on!  If  you had to spend a day with Chi-Chi's nagging, you
would be crawling back here!"
 "I can say the same for Ryoko and Aeka's fighting!"

Gohan:  I wouldn't say that until you meet Chi-Chi when she's angry.

>"Chi-Chi could be a one woman army."  Piccolo said.
 "Thats why *I* never got hitched."  Vegeta said.  "The last thing I
need is a woman controlling me!"

Vash:  Instead, you knocked Bulma up.
Vegeta:  ...yes indeed.

>"So, you guys fight any good battles?"  Tenchi asked, changing the
subject.
 "Here we go."  Piccolo muttered under his breath.
 Goku was nearly out of his seat.  "Oh man!  Tons!  Okay...it was us
versus Frieza on Piccolo's home planet Namek........."

Chris:  Ok, I admit Goku likes to fight, but I don't recall him ever 
bragging about his fights.

>Goku talked on and on, Vegeta adding his own bits and pieces.  A
sweatdrop appeared on Tenchi's forehead.
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

All:  WTF!?!?
Chris:  That's got to be the most screwed up page break I've ever seen.

>"So Washu....uh....Little Washu.  Explain to me how this works."
Bulma said pointing to the IAT.
 "Gladly!  The IAT transports others to here.  But in your place, time
has completely stopped."

Gohan:  Yea, we wouldn't anyone wondering where we went..(rolls his 
eyes)

>"What a machine!  Can you *show* me how it works?"
 Washu pushed a couple of buttons, explaining what she did as she did
it.
 After the familiar noise and light, a young man appeared on the
floor.
 "Huh?"  he asked.
 "Trunks!"  Bulma exclaimed.
 "Mom?  What am I doing here?  Here I am talking to someone

Vash (as Trunks):  I refuse to be specific about who I was talking to!

>and next
thing I know, I'm here!"
 Bulma explained to Trunks about where he was, what happened, and the
people who lived here.
 "Did you say lots of girls?"

Vegeta:  Finally!  My son has grown up!
Tenchi:  You're starting to sound like my dad.

>"Yeah!"
 Washu smiled.  "I have just the girl for you.....on one
condition.........."
 "Which is?"
 "You call me Little Washu!"
 "Easy enough!"
 Washu closed her eyes and called to Ryoko through their mind link,
telling her of a handsome young man who wanted to me her.

Chris:  Yea, me!
Tenchi:  I doubt she would.
Chris:  (pulls out gun) are you talking about me or Trunks?
Tenchi:  Um..Trunks.yea, that's it..Trunks.heheheh..

>Sure enough, Ryoko appeared, startling Trunks.  Taking one look at
him, she forgot the love she once had for Tenchi.

Vash:  Would she really do that?  Just appear when someone tells her 
about a handsome young man?  I mean, her life is dedicated to Tenchi!
Chris:  I dunno, but if it is, I shouldn't have let Washu kill herself, 
so she could try that for me.
Tenchi:  excuse me??
Chris:  Um.nothin..

>Trunks stared right back at her.  He had never seen anything more
beautiful.  He looked deep into her golden eyes.
 "You must be Ryoko."  he said awkwardly.

Gohan:  Who told him her name?
Vegeta:  I dunno.

 >Yeah."
 "You're very beautiful."
 "She gets that from me!"  Washu insisted.
 Ryoko rolled her eyes and walked over to Trunks.  "Whaddya say we
blow this popsicle stand?"

Vash:  Heheh.blow.

>"I'm with you!"
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Chris:  I have a headache...
Gohan:  I know, that thing is annoying..

>Chi-Chi had finished looking at the cave where Ryoko had been
imprisoned.  She wondered about what was or had been behind the iron
gates.  She stood for awhile, pondering, but then decided to go to the
onsen.
 It took her awhile to find it, but eventually she did.  She walked
inside and found

Vegeta:  ..Noboyuki wearing a thong
Chris:  You would like that wouldn't you?

 >Aeka.
 "Hello Princess Aeka."
 "Hello.  How is your stay going."
 "Wonderful.  Its peaceful here."  Chi-Chi said sliding into the
water. 

Gohan:  Did she get into the water with clothes on or was she walking 
around with no clothes on?
Tenchi:  Vash would like that.

 >"I see you like Tenchi."
 "Very much Miss Chi-Chi."
 "He looks like he woud make a good husband."
 "Yes.....what is it like to have a husband?"
 "With Goku, it can be wonderful, but scary.  He is so sweet, but then
he drags Gohan off to some battle.  He doesn't realize that I'm scared
to death of those battles!  I'm afraid one day he won't come home!"
 Aeka gave Chi-Chi a comforting smile.  "There has been times when
Lord Tenchi has fought too.  I know how scary it is thinking the one
you love could die."
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Tenchi:  Arg..those're getting to me too.

 >Sasami laughed in triumph as she defeated Gohan for the tenth time.

Gohan:  In response, he blew her into the next dimension! 
MUAHAHAHHAHA!!!
Sasami (from outside the theater):  You wouldn't!! oh.here we go again 
(vomiting sounds are heard)
Chris:  Geez, she really is sick.

 >"I never knew a person who could beat me at this game!"  Gohan mused.
 Sasami smiled and checked her watch.  "I'd love to win more Gohan,
but I have dinner to cook."
 "Thats okay Sasami.  I'll go and keep you company."
 The two ran down to the kitchen, passing Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta, and
Tenchi in a blur.

Gohan:  Hmph. I would totally outrun her.

>Piccolo was snoring away, and Vegeta had lost interest, but Goku
continued on, recounting every detail of every fight.
 Goku stopped talking to watch Sasami and Gohan.
 "Awwww!" Goku said laughing.  "The little guy's in love!"

Gohan:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
 Nonononononononononononono!!!!
All but Gohan:  Gohan's in lo~ove, Gohan's in lo~ove!
Gohan:  No!!
All but Gohan:  Gohan and Sasami, sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G!
Gohan:  ..ok, now that's just childish.

 >"Females," Vegeta sneered.  "The number one weakness!"
 "You said it!"  Tenchi agreed.

Vash (as Tenchi):  I agree with that because I'm homosexual!
Tenchi:  No I'm not!  (Slices Vash's head off with the tenchi-ken)
Chris:  Woo-hoo death #1!!

>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

All:  Godammit!!!
Chris:  (Flicks author off)

 >"Dinnertime!"  Sasamia called awhile later.

Vegeta:  While, Sasami, tied up and gagged in the pantry struggled to 
warn her family about the evil clone known as 'Sasamia' who was 
plotting to give everyone food poisoning and/or salmonella.
Chris:  hehe..

>Kiyone and Mihoshi entered the house, just as everyone was crowding
around the table.  Kiyone leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.

Gohan:  I thought Mihoshi was the one who always slept.
Tenchi:  She is, it's just that this author has everyone acting OOC.

 >"I'm so exhausted!"  she said wearily.
 "Hard day Kiyone?"  Sasami asked.

Dead Vash:  hehe..hard..
Tenchi:  (stomps on dead Vash)  Stay dead dammit!

 >"Yeah."
 Tenchi looked over to Washu.  "Um......Little Washu."
 "Yes?"
 "How are we going to fit everyone at this table?"
 Washu gave him a big grin.  "Just leave it to the greatest scientific
genius in the universe!"
 Her Washu-bots appeared on her shoulders.

All:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Vegeta:  The mini-demons!!
Chris:  Kill them!!  (everyone forms an angry mob and go off to destroy 
the satanic Washu-bots)

 >"Leave it to Washu!"  A said.
 "She's a genius!"  B exclaimed.
 Washu gave Bulma a friendly wink as her holo computer appeared in
front of her.
 She punched a few keys and the table disappeared and was replaced by
a new, longer one that was already set.  Everyone sat down as Sasami
brought the food over.
 Soon, everyone was talking to everyone else, causing the room to be
filled with joyful chatter.  Washu would type a little on her holo
computer, say something, and then join the conversation.
 "Washu..."  Tenchi began.
 "Ah ah ah!  *Little* Washu"  Washu interuppted.
 "Um....Little Washu, what are you doing?"
 "I'm creating rooms for our guests to stay in."
 Tenchi nodded.
 After dinner, Washu showed them the extra rooms.
 "Am I a *genius* or what?!"
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()
 Washu sighed.  For the past week, the Masaki house had been
peaceful.  For once, no fights.

(everyone returns.  Chris has a little bit of pink metal hair sticking 
out of his mouth)
Tenchi:  That was fun.  Except, for when Chris ate Washu-bot B.
Vegeta:  Don't tell me the author dared use that dumbass page break of 
his again!?
Gohan:  What'd we miss?
Sasami (from outside theater):  No one's fighting.
Chris:  That's odd..

>She was working alongside Bulma.  They both knew that the two groups
wouldn't be able to stay together forever, but they wished they
could.  So they worked on new inventions to keep their minds off their
worries.
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Chris:  My skull!!! AAAAAAHH!!!

>Ryoko and Trunks walked into the house.  Ryoko was excited.  Her
excitement flooded into Washu's head through their mind link, causing
her to run up to Ryoko.
 "Ryoko!  You can't be this excited and not tell me why!"

Tenchi:  Technically, she shouldn't.  Ryoko can't hide her thoughts 
from Washu.

 >"First you have to get everyone in here!  Especially Aeka, heh heh."

Gohan:  okay, If she's going to say what I think she's going to say, 
then why would Ayeka be angry?

 >"Oh come on!  Tell me tell me tell me!"

Vegeta (as Washu):  I'm so excited I'm not bothering with periods!

>"You can wait."
 "Oh okay."  Washu said disappointedly.  Her holo computer appeared
and she typed half heartedly.  Everyone appeared. looking confused.

Chris:  That is a huge sentence fragment.
Tenchi:  I'll say.
Gohan:  Not only that, but its horrible grammar as well.

 >"All easy for the greatest scientific genius in the universe."
 "Oh....its just Washu."  Kiyone said as the Washu-bots appeared

Tenchi:  AAAHH!!! I thought we killed those things!
Chris:  Apparently not.

>on
Washu's shoulders wearing little pink cheerleading outfits.
 "Go Washu, go Washu!  You're a genius, you're a genius........"  the
sang.
 Washu danced a little to their song, but turned immediatly serious,

All:  ?????

>remembering Ryoko's news.
 "What are we here for?"  Tenchi asked.
 "Ryoko has some news."  Washu explained.  "What is it Ryoko?"
 Ryoko smiled at Trunks.
 "We're in love!"  Trunks said.
 "And we're getting married."  Ryoko added.

Tenchi:  AAAHH!! NO FUCKING WAY!
Chris:  I thought you found her a pain.
Tenchi:  I'm a guy, so naturally, I admire Ryoko's .erm..anatomy.
Gohan:  I'd be fond of her too is she flaunced them around in my face 
the way she does to you.
Chris:  Anyone would.

 >Everyone was silent, then everything started at once.
 Washu and Bulma rushed up to congratulate their children.
Tenchi silently thanked Trunks.  Mihoshi started to sing about a
wedding.  Aeka stood up and laughed her high-pitched laugh.

All:  (cringe)
Vegeta:  My ears..
Gohan:  At least Tenchi killed Vash before he could laugh.
All:  (cringe again)

 >"Now Tenchi is mine!"
 Vegeta looked to Tenchi.  "Don't fall in love man.  It'll be your
worst mistake!"
 Aeka looked at Vegeta angrily.
 "Its too late Vegeta!  Tenchi already *does* love me, don't you
Tenchi?"
 "Um............"
 Ryoko looked from Bulma to Washu and shuddered.  They were already
discussing some kind of invention that would make wedding planning
easier.

Vegeta:  That's rather dumb.

 ><Oh great.  *Two* scientific geniuses for mothers.>
 Mihoshi yawned and said  "I'm sleepy!  Can we go to bed now?"
 No one heard her.  Every one was engaged in watching Aeka and Vegeta
trying to outdo eachother.

Vegeta:  I'm sure it didn't last very long.
Chris:  totally.

 >"Have *you* ever fallen in love Vegeta?"
 "Yeah."
 "You have?"
 "Yeah!"
 "What happened?"
 Vegeta jerked his thumb in Trunks' direction.  "Kids."
 Aeka smirked.  "Heh heh!  Almighty Vegeta can't handle the pitter
patter of little feet!"
Vegeta:  I'm hurt.
All:  (snicker)

 >The *whole* gang was now watching the two.  They all burst out
laughing at Aeka's wit.

Chris (as Ryoko):  That was pathetic Ayeka!
Gohan (as Mihoshi):  Now we're all going to laugh at your stupid wit.
All (as everyone but Ayeka):  Ahahahahahahahahaha!
Tenchi:  You suck!

>Watching Aeka and Ryoko fight was annoying, but watching these two
fight was just plain ol' amusing!
 "What do *you* know about kids you nitwit?"
 "Nitwit?!  Azaka......Kamidake........."
 The two guardians appeared beside her.
 "Aeka, not in the living room!"  Tenchi yelled.
 "Everyone duck!"  Washu exclaimed.

Vegeta:  And a duck flew through the living room and beaned Ayeka in 
the head.
Chris:  hehe..

 >Everyone got on the floor and covered their heads.  They weren't
stupid.  They knew what was coming.
 "Yes Miss Aeka?"  Kamidake asked.
 "Attack him!"  Aeka ordered.
 "Yes Ma'am."
 The two guardians powered up.  Vegeta just smiled.
 "All right!  Now were talking!
Gaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccc Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuunn!"

Vegeta:  I don't remember, do I even have an attack like that?
Tenchi:  You probably forgot 'cause your hair is growing into your 
skull and messing with your brain.
Chris:  This is a riot.

 >Trunks stepped between Aeka and Vegeta.  "Dad!"  he shouted.  "Don't
you *ever* hit a girl!"
 Vegeta stopped his blast and Aeka stopped the guardians.  Vegeta
turned to Aeka.  "You're lucky this time princess!"  he sneered.
 "I think its time we got to bed."  Bulma said softly.

Tenchi (as himself talking hardly as opposed to softly):  No we will 
not!

 >Everyone else agreed and hurried out of the room.
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()
Chris:  (grinds his teeth in frustration)

 >A few days later, Washu and Bulma were standing in front of Ryoko and
Trunks with a large book in their hands.

Gohan (as Bulma):  I will now beat myself to death with this book!

 >"This is our invention to help you plan the wedding!  With this,
you'll be able to get married sooner!"

Chris:  It's a book, dumbass!  It's not an invention!

 >"What is it?"  Trunks asked.
 "Its our Do-It-Yourself-Wedding-Made-Easy-Book."  Washu explained.
"With this book you can pick a time, date, and place for your wedding,
design your own decorations, dresses and tuxes, pick a preacher, order
food, everything!  Instead of it taking months to plan the wedding,
you can plan it within a day!"

Tenchi (as Bulma):  Unfortunately, in order for it to be planned and 
completed within a day, you have to be a super-genuis like me and 
little Washu here.
Chris:  Actually, that's probably just the author's lame ass plan to 
get out of having to write the weeks it would take to plan and finish 
the wedding.

 >"Wow thanks guys!"  Ryoko exclaimed.
 "Yeah!"  Trunks agreed.  "We won't have to wait to be married!"
 Washu smiled and looked to Ryoko.
 "What is it Washu?"
 "Ryoko!  For crying out loud, CALL ME MOM!" 

Gohan:  FOR CRYING OUT LOUD SHE SAID 'GUYS', NOT 'WASHU' YOU STUPID 
DITZ!!!
Tenchi:  I agree.  Washu's acting more like a ditz than Mihoshi does.  
Speaking of which, I don't think the author's mentioned her since she 
pushed the button on the IAT.
Vegeta:  Oh come on, that's all she's good for: making dumb mistakes to 
advance the plot.

 >"Okay okay!"
 Washu looked at Bulma.  "They grow up so fast!"
 "They do."  Bulma agreed.
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Chris:  (whimpers and curls into a fetal position)
Gohan:  We get the point, Chris.  You hate the page breaks.
Chris:  (stands up and brushes himself off):  I knew that.  I just 
wanted to make sure you understood.

 >A month later, Washu cried silently as Ryoko walked up the aisle in
her stunning dress.  

All:  ????
Tenchi:  If it's a month later, then what was the point of making a 
book that lets them decorate, plan, and finish the wedding in one 
day?!?!
Vegeta:  yet another example of the authors inconsistency.

>Trunks stood proudly, watching her.  Washu was
Ryoko's Best Maid, which pleased her.  Mihoshi, Kiyone, and even Aeka
were also Bride's Maids.  Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo were
Trunks' Best Men.
 The couple said there vows, and finally, sealed the deal with a
kiss.  Washu watched sadly as the limo drove off. 

Tenchi:  You never mentioned any limo!  And where the fuck do they 
think they're going?  Do they think they're just going to drive in a 
limo to DBZ land or whatever?
 
>She and Bulma had
created a large home for the happy couple to live in as a wedding
present.  It was in the woods near the Masaki home.  At least her
daughter would be close.....but it would never be the
same................

Chris:  Phssh.probably because she's married to a complete loser.
Vegeta:  Silence, fool!!

>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

(everyone looks at Chris expectantly)
Chris:  What?  Oh. (starts banging his head on the wall)
Gohan:  Better
Chris (with zero enthusiasm):  aaaah the pain.  Make it stop.  Please.

 >Everyone gathered together in Washu's lab to see the guests off.
Washu walked up to Bulma.
 "Here Bulma.  These are for you."
 A pair of Bulma-bots took their places on her shoulders.

All:  DEAR GOD NO!!!
Tenchi:  They're multiplying!!

 >"Bulma is the greatest!"  A said.
 "She is the best!"  B agreed.
 "Come visit anytime."  Tenchi said laughing.
Tenchi:  I'm laughing because those robots made me lose my sanity.
Chris:  One by one the Washu-bots are stealing my sanity.

 >Washu waved sadly and pressed a button on the IAT.  Trunks waved his
goodbye as the six people disappeared.
!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Chris:  I've become numb to it.  Its just dumb now.

 >Epilogue................
 Goku, Vegeta, Chi-Chi, Bulma, Gohan, and Piccolo all returned to
their own places. 

Vegeta (sarcastically):  no, they moved into Tenchi's house and caused 
many ridiculous situations, giving birth to a new series:  DBZ Muyo.

 >They explained Trunks' disappearance.  But they all
returned to visit once a month.

Tenchi:  What if Washu forgot to transport them one day?
Chris:  What if a big bad guy came, and Trunks wasn't there to help 
save the day, so everyone was killed?

>Aeka and Tenchi soon fell in love and were married. 

Tenchi:  Naw..

 >Gohan and Sasami
were in love too, but waited for awhile before they got married.
(Teehee)

Gohan:  Not funny!  You fucking ass sucker!

> Aeka convinced Chi-Chi to talk to Goku about her fears.  She did and
Goku completely understood.

All:  ...GAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Vegeta:  (wiping a tear from his eye) oh god that was hilarious..

 >Everything had been peaceful since the guests had come to stay with
them.  And it still was.  Washu had a feeling it would be peaceful for
a loooooooooooonnnnnng time....................

Chris:  But she was wrong.  I blew up the planet five days later.

 >THE END

Like I said, this is my first crossover fic!  If you have any
questions or comments or anything, let me know at
iamabrat@voyager.net
Thanks!

Chris:  Alright, I will be back in a second, talk amongst yourselves, 
and Vegeta, we will resolve the whole 'blow up the base and everyone 
with it' issue soon enough.
Vegeta:  You better.
(Chris leaves while the others criticize parts of the fic that they 
hadn't while it was still going.  Once outside the theater, Chris slams 
a big red button on the wall by the door.  A muffled explosion is 
heard.)
Chris:  MUAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAH!!!  I'VE KILLED THEM ALL!!!  THE THEATER WAS 
LINED WITH EXPLOSIVES!! AHHAHAHAH- (notices Sasami lying down on the 
ground dead with a trail of vomit running out of her mouth)
Chris:  Geez she really was sick. (shrugs)  oh well.better get out the 
mop.


-end-

Disclaimer:  I do not own Tenchi, Sasami, Vash, Vegeta, or Gohan.  
Someone else does.  I only own myself.  On a further note, although 
this fortunately has not happened as of yet, please do not send me hate 
mail for killing off what might be your favorite character(s).  It's 
all in good, clean fun (psh yea, 'clean')

'Til next time.

Death toll:  5
