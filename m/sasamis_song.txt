Sasami’s Song - Little Voice Inside

Adapted by: Zylle

Mother, do you hear me
‘Cause I know I hear you
I waited for the answers
While sitting in my room
I danced to the rhythm
And moved by myself
No one could see through me
Or hear the words I felt

Chorus:
Little voice inside keeps calling
Little voice inside it cries
Little voice inside keeps calling
Little voice -- oh, won’t you be my guide?

I sometimes hear the echo
The pattern of my cry
I sometimes feel the pulling
>From a sound that’s deep inside
Quiet are the whispers
And silent are my eyes
No one hears but me
That little voice inside, you see...

Chorus
