                    ----An Old Friend, a New Scenario----


Ryoko yawned as she floated down from the rafter. Breakfast smelled as 
good as ever.
"Mmm yeah!" Ryoko said, mouth watering.
"It's really quite disgusting to watch you drool, Ryoko." Ayeka said in 
her 'I know better' tone. Ryoko just stuck her tongue out at Ayeka, then 
disappeared to go find Tenchi.
Tenchi woke up to Ryoko staring at him. "Morning, my Tenchi."
"AAGHH!" Tenchi said. "Not again! When will you stop that?!"
Ryoko hung on him while he walked. "Tenchi, I care about you. I want to 
see you all the time. Is that so wrong?"
"RYOKO!! Get your hands off Lord Tenchi this instant!" Ayeka demanded.
"Oh really? Who's going to make me?" At that Ryoko started to make 
kissie faces at Tenchi.
"I command you! You are quite a nuisance. I'm sure Lord Tenchi feels the 
same way. Now shoo before you cause more trouble!" Ayeka was her 
annoying self that morning.
"Breakfast!" Sasami said, breaking the tension, and Ryoko headed 
downstairs.
"Mmmmmmmmm. *Bite* Sasami, you sure can cook *Chew* good! If there's 
anything you are really great at, *Swallow* it's cooking!" Mihoshi 
complemented, as she ate some of her food.
"Yep, this sure is good!" Noboyuki agreed. Ryoko was gobbling hers down.
"Mlrore Prleashe!" She said, her mouth full.
"Ryoko, such bad manners." Whenever Ayeka had a chance to correct Ryoko, 
she took it. Ryoko replied with catapulting a piece of a rice cake at 
Ayeka's head with her fork.
"Hey, you!" Ayeka said, fuming. "What do you think you are doing?!"
"Haha! A little red Princess?" Ryoko replied smugly, throwing a whole 
rice cake this time.
"How dare you! I am the Crown Princess of--" Just then, Ayeka was beaned 
by the rice cake.
Ayeka retaliated by shoving her bowl of Meso Soup in Ryoko's face. Ryoko 
had the same idea, and they were both covered in soup. Sasami sighed. 
"Here we go again."
Mihoshi just sat eating, clueless. Tenchi tried to stop the fight, and 
ended up with salmon smushed on his face. "Wow Princess. I can't believe 
what you did to my Tenchi." Ryoko
said.
"What I did??" Ayeka said. "What about you?"
She pointed at the back of Tenchi's head. Ryoko's rice was in tangledin 
his hair.
"That's enough!!" Yelled Tenchi. "You two--"
Just then, a sound from the closet. Washu burst out. "Good morning all! 
What's for breakfast?"
"Tenchi, apparently." Noboyuki said. Everyone started laughing. But 
then, the heard a sound. A very familiar sound. Mihoshi was sitting at 
the table, so it couldn't be her ship.
They rushed out to see a ship fall from a whole in the sky. "What 
the...?!" Tenchi was confused. *SPLASH*. It fell in the lake. A woman 
frantically dog-paddled to the dock. She was wearing a Space Police 
outfit and had long green hair.

Author: Get it yet?

"Hey look. She's a space police officer." Mihoshi stated. "But I don't 
know her."
"Hi." The woman said after she got on solid ground. "I'm Lieutenant 
Kiyone Makibi of the Space Police."
She rung out her jacket, and saluted. 
"Hi! I'm Mihoshi!" Mihoshi saluted Kiyone.
"Lieutenant Mihoshi! I was sent to find you. I was to bring you back 
with me for an extensive report on your surveillance of the Solar 
System. Let's go!" Kiyone was gung ho, but she forgot one little detail.
"Excuse me, Miss Kiyone, but your ship is--" Ayeka started.
"Never mind about my ship. Lieutenant! Get ready!" Kiyone said.
"But your sh--" Sasami said.
"I don't have all day, Mihoshi." Kiyone interrupted.
"Listen Lady, your ship is UNDER WATER." Ryoko said.
"Ugh. I forgot that. Why don't you people have landing beacons?!" Kiyone 
wanted to get back to headquarters.
"Sorry." Tenchi said.
"I could get your ship out of there." Washu said.
"Really??" Kiyone asked.
"Yeah! I AM the number one genius scientist in the UNIVERSE. But I 
wont." Washu frowned, then said, "Not unless you call me, LITTLE 
WASHU!!"
Kiyone fell down. *Sweat drop* "What??"
"Call me Little Washu or no ship!"
"Is she crazy?!"
"You'd be surprised." Tenchi said. Just then Washu stared at him right 
in the face.
"Uh, umm.." Kiyone couldn't believe this. "Please help me out, Little 
Washu! A Genius such as yourself should be able to do this no problem!"
"When you say it like that, of course I'll do it! Peace of cake." She 
brought out her computer.
"A few buttons to press, and TA DA!!" 
The ship came out of the water, and landed on ground. "Thanks!" Kiyone 
said in relief.
"Okay Mihoshi, get your stuff and your report and lets go report in."
"Umm, see, the thing is.." Mihoshi twiddled her thumbs. "I kind of, 
didn't write a report."
"WHAT?!" Kiyone couldn't go back without a report. "What am I going to 
do? I can't leave here without you and your report!"
"There there." Ryoko said, patting her on the back.
"Ryoko. You are the one that attacked Jurai, right?" Kiyone said.
"Yes. So, you've heard about me."
"Yes, heard enough. You're under arrest!" Kiyone pulled out her badge.
"What?" Tenchi didn't know what to do.
"What are you, insane? I've been pardoned." Ryoko said.
"Oh, I just CAN'T CATCH A BREAK IN THIS JOB!!" Kiyone was a bit 
stressed.

Author: This isn't a mockery of Kiyone, but I believe she had problems 
before Mihoshi, she just enjoyed blaming her. Mihoshi was her punching 
bag. So now I get to test out my theory.

"Um, *sweat drop*." She had to get back to headquarters. "Lieutenant 
Mihoshi, why haven't you written a report??"
"Umm, well, see, I *heehee* didn't know I was supposed to, *heh* isn't 
that funny?" Mihoshi was her ditsy self.
"Leave it to Mihoshi to mess things up," Washu said.
"That wasn't very nice, Washu!" Mihoshi said, defending herself.
"Nice? No. True? Yes." Washu said.
"Haha!!" Ryoko laughed.
"Really, Ryoko. You shouldn't laugh at someone's expense." Ayeka said.
"Listen Princess, why don't you get off your high horse and make me??" 
Ryoko had her chance, and she took it.
"Why, you!" Ayeka was red with anger.
"Do they always fight like this?" Kiyone asked.
"It's a lot worse when Tenchi is involved." Sasami said, sighing.
"What'cha go'nna do?" Ryoko said, flying around, making funny faces and 
sticking out her tongue. Kiyone rolled her eyes.
"You ill mannered heathen!"
"You stuck up--"
"How dare you--"
"HAHA!"
The others walked into the house, while the two duked it out once more.

*THE END* Or is it?

Author's Notes:

How did you like it? All comments sent to gailamee@hotmail.com. I really 
like Kiyone, and as my 4th favorite character and 3rd favorite tenchi 
girl (Washu and Ryoko first and always),
I HAD to put her in the OAV, which is my favorite series. One of my 
first attempts at a fanfic.
