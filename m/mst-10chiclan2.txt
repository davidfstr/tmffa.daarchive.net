<Our brave heroes return to finish the job>

Shadow: Like we have a choice?

Guardian: They better have cleaned the theater, that’s all I can say.

Bard: Look on the bright side, it can’t get any worse!

<A dead silence ensues>

Bard: What? What’d I do?!

Rowan: You just had to say that, now we’re doomed.

Shadow: I feel a strong disturbance in the Force......

Guardian: Ixnay on the gratuitious promotion for Lucas.

<The four take their seats>

>Tenchi:   Mitsuki... I have to go...

Rowan: So do I! Bye!

<Others>: Oh no you don’t!!! You’re staying till the end just like the rest
of us.

Rowan: Curses, foiled again!

>Mitsuki:  And do what?

Guardian: Get a vasectomy.

Shadow: Become a monk.

Bard: Have a big orgy.

<Insert scene of mindless violence here>

Shadow & Guardian: And say quiet this time!

>Tenchi:   My friends are worried about me at home.

Rowan: Yes, where would they be without their loveslave?

Shadow: Don’t you start!

>Mitsuki:  Oh.  I'm sorry.

Bard: Sharing is caring, caring is sharing *POW**WHACK**WHAM*

Rowan: Who let him watch those old Transformers episodes?

Shadow & Guardian: Don’t look at us!

>-=**=-

Rowan: We sacrifice our good taste upon this altar.

>     Tenchi makes it back to the Masaki household, but Mayuka runs him over

Guardian: And that was the end of Tenchi, the imprint on her minivan was
another story.

Shadow: Stop stealing my lines!

>trying to greet him at the door.
>
>Mayuka:   Daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy!!  I'm so glad that daddy's back!!

Bard: Hmmm...I wonder if Mayuka missed her daddy.

<The Others groan>

>Tenchi:   Ouch...  Mayuka!

Rowan:(Tenchi) Spine.....crushed in......bear hug.

Shadow: *Rip* And Tenchi never had to worry about having children ever
again.

<Others>: AAAARGGHaaagghHHH!!! STOP THAT!!!

>Mayuka:   Did you bring me anything, daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy?!

Bard: (Tenchi) I sure did!

<Shadow whips out his MegaBat of Doom
 and proceeds to use the Bard’s head as the ball>

*POUND*POUND*MAIM*DESTROY*

Guardian: Well done.

Tenchi:   [Oh, that Mayuka is so cute.

Rowan: I do not like where this line of reasoning is going.

>  She keeps calling me "daddy" when she
> knows good and well that I'm not technically her daddy,

<All>: Yes you are!!!

Rowan: She’s got half of your DNA!!! If that doesn’t
             make her your daughter then what does??!

> and she's a year younger than I am.]

Guardian: No she’s not! Mayuka isn’t even a year old yet!!!

Shadow: Erk....picking up....author continuity violation....

>Mayuka:   You didn't bring me anything?!

Guardian: I wouldn’t say that.

<Rowan casually produces his staff>

Rowan: Don’t you start.

>That's okay!  Daddy can give me something else!

Bard: Gurgle...*POW*....************

Rowan: You never learn.

 >Right, daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy?!!

Shadow: (Tenchi) Wrong, MayukaMayukaMayukaMayukaMayuka!!!

>^0^

Rowan: Evil!!!

<All>: KILL!!!



>    [SHWING!!  AAAAAHH!!  NOT AGAIN!!  NOT WITH HER!!]

Rowan: DEFINITELY NOT WITH HER!!!

Shadow: It’s out of control!!!

Bard: NO!!! What happened to the fun Tenchi Lemon scenes???!!

Guardian: We are descending into a world where morals and tact no longer
apply.
We have entered <Dramatic pause> The Bad Lemon Zone!

<Serious music plays>

>Mayuka:   Oh, what a big thing you got between your legs,
>          daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy!!

Shadow: (Mayuka) Now I can try out the new axe mommy gave me!
                      <Wood chopping sounds> Timber!
                       <Tree crashing>

<Others>: Ewww....*Shudder*

>Tenchi:   [The better to fuck your...] AAAARGH!!  No, Mayuka!  I can't...!

Rowan: We sure hope you can’t!

Guardian: Looks like Tenchi’s little head has
               sucked out all of the brains from his big head.

Bard: Or vice versa, this a lemon after all.

>Mayuka:   (Spreads herself wide and changes her personality.)

Rowan: Uh oh....

Guardian: Not good.

Shadow: (Mayuka): I am 7 of 9. I will assimalate you. Resistance is futile.

Bard (to Shadow): I hate you.

> C'mon, Tenchi. You want it.  I want it.  There's no escape.

Shadow: (Vader) It is your destiny.

<Others>: (Luke) NEVER!!!

>     Mayuka frees his mighty Johnson from it's cage yet again.

Bard: So the Evangelion’s real name is Johnson?

> His animalistic urges take over once more

Guardian: Proving once and for all that pets shouldn’t
                be allowed in the house.

Rowan: That....made absolutely no sense at all.

Guardian: Neither does this fic.

Rowan: Good point.

> and pounds the living daylights

<All>: Bond beat you to it!

> out of yet another victim's pussy.

Shadow: (Tenchi) Take that Luna! *Whip cracking*

<The others give Shadow a long look then slowly back away from him>

>  Mayuka howls outworldishly

Shadow: Right before she morphs into
              a werewolf and bites your face off.

Rowan: That’s it, no more late night horror movies for you!

> as she feels herself get banged and
>filled and violated repeatedly for minutes on end...

{Our reviewers turn an interesting shade of green}

 >   [SPLURRRTT!!]

Bard: Ewww....we just washed them too.

 >    An uncontrollable shockwave hits Tenchi

Shadow: That’d be us trying to kill you for doing this.

>as he downloads his seed into her.

Rowan: The true horror of sex on the Internet.

>And he keeps on filling her;

>he's unable to stop his torrent of semen

Guardian: There is a flashflood warning in effect for the Masaki valley.

Bard: In other news the the Navy has found its ships deserted. Where’d the
crew go?

<Ryo-ohki throws a tomato, that was too horrible for a rimshot>

> squirting from out of his manhood.  It ends up
>spilling from out of the lucious daughter/not-daughter's
>pussy and onto the floor.
> Mayuka's eyes are rolled far back into her head,
>moaning until her lungs ran out of air.

Shadow: Mercifully putting Mayuka out of her misery.

Guardian: How about something to put us out of our misery!!

>Suddenly she turns back to normal.

Rowan: So now she’s a little baby again?

>Mayuka:   That was the greatest, daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy!!
>  Let's do this again and again and again and again, forever
>and ever and ever, daddydaddydaddydaddydaddy!!

<All>: Arrrggghhhh!!!!

>Tenchi facevaults in total loss of energy.

<The reviewers facefault from the sheer lack of taste here>

>-=**=-

Bard: (Frog) Bud

Guardian: (Frog #2) Wise

Rowan: (Lizard) er...

>After a good dinner, Tenchi decides to hit the bed early.

Bard: How can you eat after that?!!

>He knew it's going to be one of those days again:
>The fighting, the explosions, the swift mood changes,
>the havoc, the chaos, and ultimately, the fucking.

Shadow: Yes, Let’s not forget the fucking.
               The horrible Horrible HORRIBLE.....

{Others}: We get the point already.

>If the girls had their way with him, they'd clone him
> and use the clones as anatomically-correct fuck-dolls!
> This is terrible.

Rowan: No, this is illegal. If you were married to them then it would be
terrible.

> He wished he'd never freed the demon, Ryoko, from her prison.
>   Just then, a soft light appears in the middle of the room.

Rowan: In the name of the moon I will punish you!

Guardian: Prepare to be Judged.

Shadow: We come in peace. *Laser firing*

Bard: Thank you for calling the goddess hotline.

>  Tenchi gets up to see what it is, thinking it's probably
> Ryoko or Washuu trying to get another fuck from him.

<All>: Yet he still goes to look anyway.

>But then, it turns out to be the High Goddess of Jurai,
>Tsunami, wearing the Juraian ceremonial robe and a
>weak smile on her face.

Bard: And nothing else!!

Rowan: Where the heck do you get the strength to keep doing that?!

>Tsunami:  Well, Lord Tenchi.  It seems that it was a busy day for you.
>
>Tenchi:   Well... heh.  The only complaint is that it's taking it's toll on
me.

{All}: THAT’S ALL YOU’RE COMPLAINING ABOUT???!!

> I can't keep doing this forever, you know.

{All}: Never say you can’t do something, you’ll regret it every time.

>Tsunami:  But you have drunk the water
>from the tree of life, Tenchi Masaki.
>You will be able to last for centuries.
>There is no need for you to worry about that.

<All>: Where can we get some of this?

>Tenchi:   You've got to excuse me, Miss Tsunami.
>             All I want right now is to catch some Z's...
>
>Tsunami:  Then you will "catch your Z's."

{All}: Uh oh.......

>And with that, the High Goddess
>of Jurai flings off her robe to reveal...

Guardian: A battle bikini.

Shadow: Black leather and a cat of nine tails.

Rowan: That it was actually Urd who had
            been messing with Tenchi’s head.

Bard:A sight mere mortals would kill to see.

>A Juraian summer string bikini swimsuit!

Guardian: Holy....

Rowan: There’s not enough fabric for that.

>     [SHWING!!]

Shadow: (Umpire) And miss. You’re OUT!

>Tenchi:   Oh God, help me!  HELP ME, PLEASE!!

Guardian: God wants nothing to do with this!

>Tsunami:  Help you?  From what?

Rowan: (Tenchi): Help me escape from this Fic please!!!

>Tenchi:   It happens every time! You want me to do you, and
>                then I grab you and rape the crap outta you!
>                I can't do that anymore!

Bard: {Tenchi}: Yeah! The grabbing is too much trouble!

>Tsunami:  Well, what do you want to do?

{Our reviewers are currently beating the crap out of the Bard}

>Tenchi:   I wanna be gentler!  I wanna be kinder!
>              I wanna give you the real sexual experience
>              a real man can give!

Shadow: I guess that automatically disqualifies you then.

Guardian: Oooh, That’s harsh.

>Tsunami:  TENCHI!!  It has always been this way;
>             with animals and with humans.

Rowan: Maybe on planet Jurai, not here!!

>The female wants to be mated, the male wants to mate.

Shadow:  But that has nothing to do with this situation!

>  The female opens her gates and the male enters.
>  Fluid gets transfered.  It is so simple.
> (Comes over to Tenchi and places his hand onto her left breast.)
>  Tenchi, my lord.  Be simple.

Guardian: Try simpleton instead.

 >    [SSHHWIIING!!!]

<All>: <Make the sound of someone being electrocuted>

>     Tenchi finally loses it

Shadow: (Tenchi looking in his pants) It’s GONE!!!

>as he slams his mighty*2 Johnson

Rowan: Inflicts double damage to any magical being.

Bard: Don’t you start, one dark reviewer is enough.

> into the Juraian Goddess. It ends up being more
>than she can handle, but is too lost into the fusion

Guardian: They exploded?

>of pain and pleasure to tell him to stop.
>Tenchi's animalistic behavior pounds away

Bard: Bad behavior!! No soup for you!

>at Tsunami's soft turquoise-haired palace as she releases a "tsunami"

{All}: BAD pun.

>of primordial juices onto his shaft, balls, and legs.
>He feels it coming, and he removes himself
>from her gates as he rolls her over and

<All>: Not the furry! Anything but the furry!!!

>all over her supreme goddess body.
>    [SSSSPPLLLUUURRRRTTTT!!!!!!]

{All}: {Oil driller}: It’s a gusher!!!

>     Tenchi's mighty*2 Johnson fires blast after blast

Shadow: Destroying all life as we know it.

>of jizz all over Tsunami's face, hair, breast, chest, stomach...

Bard: You missed a spot.

{Needless mayhem ensues}

> She grabs his Johnson and slurps the rest of his
>stickiness from his member, which is still shooting
>and running on automatic for a while.

Shadow: Gives stick shift a whole new meaning doesn’t he.

Rowan: Stop it.

>-=**=-
>     Tenchi finally manages to get some sleep.
>  He doesn't want to think about sex anymore.

{All}: It’s about time!!!

>  Not tomorrow, not for the whole week, not for the whole month!
>  He dreams of a nice dream; a dream about meeting his mother.

Rowan: I’m beginning to see an evil pattern here.

> She looks so nice when she was young.

Bard: Please don’t go there!!

>  She and his father were such a great couple
>during that time.  (It's no wonder why he turned into
>the pervert we know and hardly care for today.)

Guardian: That’s sounds familar......

Bard: What? Why are you all looking at me for??!!

>He's at a tree in the park, waiting for his mother to come by.
>  And there he is,

<All>: AAAUUUGGGHHHH!!! Achika has a Jusenkyo curse!!!

>wearing that lovely Japanese school outfit
>and her hair in a long ponytail.

>Tenchi:   Oh mom!  I'm so glad I can see you again!
>
>Achika:   Tenchi, my son.  I'm so proud of you.
>You're growing up to be a healthy boy.

Rowan: This sounds eerily like Nodoka.

>Tenchi:   (Takes her into an embrace.)
>Mom.  My life is terrible now.  I'm
>being forced to have sex with all these alien girls.

Bard: And your problem is?

> And they won't give me any rest what so ever.
>Achika:   Huh?  And you don't like it?
>
>Tenchi:   Well, it's not that I don't like it...

{All}: Then what are you complaining about??!!

>Achika:   Do you hate them?
>
>Tenchi:   No, I don't.  It's just that...

Rowan:(Tenchi) I’ve violated the laws of common decency.

Shadow: (Tenchi) I’ve turned into a raging sex-crazed idiot
              with the powers of the Overfiend.

Guardian: (Tenchi) I WANT MORE!!!

Bard: Dear Gods! The Guardian’s lost his marbles!!!

>Achika:   It's just what?
>Tenchi:   It's just happening to me all at once.
>              I'm... turning into this animal which

Rowan:  So put it to sleep!

>Tenchi's mother releases him from her hold and frowns upon him.

Bard: (Achika) Tenchi dear, that’s most unmanly of you.

>Achika:   Tenchi... dear...
>              Where do you_THINK_ you got those traits from?

Rowan: Uh....his dad?

>Tenchi:   Uhh...  My...  Dad...?

Guardian: I really hate it when you do that Rowan.

> Tenchi's dad, young Nobuyuki, is in  his
>room, butt-nekkid and totally
>evaporated from having way too much sex.

Shadow: Instant hentai, just add water.

Guardian: We really didn’t need to see that you know.

>Achika:   WRONG!!
>(She starts to bounce quite nervously,
>causing her son to worry.)

Shadow: He’s not the only one that’s worried.

> I died some years after I had you.  Do you know why?

{All}: Gee....how about that fight you had with Kain?

>Tenchi:   No...?  Why...?
>Achika:   Your father and I were planning to have another child.

Rowan: I don’t think the world’s ready for another Masaki.

>  But I wasn't as young as I thought I was back then.  So...!
>Tenchi:   You died of a heart attack... during sex...??

Guardian: (Achika) Stop putting words in my mouth!

>Achika:   [GUUSSSHHHH] That's right!

make a quick stop at the restroom to puke their guts out}

<Our much abused heroes return>

Shadow: This author read that MST by Peter Suzuki didn’t he?

Guardian: That or he’s someone like the person who wrote
           the lemon “What’s wrong with Ranma’s life”.

>   Tenchi snaps out of his wet nightmare;

Rowan: (Tenchi) I’m Drowning!!!

> only to find himself ejaculating into a
>woman who's also in bed with him.

Bard: I’d make a hentai comment here
         but I’ve got a bad feeling about this.......

>He doesn't even want to know who's pussy
>he's in right now.

Shadow: (Artemis) Argh! Flashbacks of the Evil one!!!

Shadow: Owwwww........

{All}: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!

>     No, just forget about it.

{All}: OH, NOW YOU TELL US THAT!!!

Shadow: (Tenchi) Someone please kill me now.

>                            THE END

(All): Halleluyah!!!

{The reviewers run out of the
room as fast as they can}

-Later

Guardian: Bard, if you ever let Happosai
               choose a fic again we will have to hurt you.

Shadow: It’s my turn to pick next. Expect a dark one.

Rowan: Oh bloody hell, here we go again.
