Disclaimer: Except for me, I don't own any of the characters used in this FF.  
No money is passing hands here, no need to sue.  This MST is done in fun.

The Millennium Eagle had been in orbit of Endor for almost a week.  The resident 
PokeMon trainers were showing off, much to the Ewoks delight.  Jim had yet to 
hear from Bryan or Glyph, but knew (and respected the fact) that life can be 
busy at times.  Plus the buzz from AnimePort #9 was non-existent.

Comm Officer: "Sir, incoming message for you.  Attached file indicates another 
story to MST."
Jim: "Joy to the world, yet another MST to do . . . fine.  Recall the MSTers 
only.  I'm not canceling shore leave for a story."

MSTers:
Jim Ohki: "This had to arrive on shore leave.  Damn it to hell."
Tenchi and Ayeka Masaki, with newborn son Jim (named after me, for I got Tenchi 
to decide in my lemon story): "Man, Jim here loves those Ewoks.  Couldn't this 
have waited?"
Ash and Misty Ketchum: "FINALLY, a break from the Ewoks.  They sure can party."

Jim: "Before we begin, I have an announcement.  Mihoshi and I are engaged!  Plus 
she's a month pregnant!"
Rest: O_O "MIHOSHI IS BREEDING?!"
Jim: "Har-har-har-har-dee-har-har.  You guys just narrowed down the list of 
names."
Rest: "D'OH!"

>DBZ Muyo

Tenchi and Ayeka: "Not ANOTHER DBZ crossover!"
Jim: "Sorry folks.  I MST what Command sends me."

>Disclaimer: I do not own any if the Tenchi Muyo or Dragonball Z
>characters!  You know the drill!
>Author's Note:  This is my first crossover fanfic, so that speaks for
>itself!

Ash (as fic): "That's right, I am a sentient being!  NOW GET ME OUTTA HERE!"

>       Washu's triumphant cackle could be heard throughout the Masaki
>house.  She had just finished another of her inventions.
> Washu practically ran through the broom closet door.  She pushed it
>open so hard, that it slammed into the wall.  Everyone was watching a
>t.v. program and nearly jumped out of their seats.

Jim: "Nothing like wiring the joy buzzer into the couch."
Tenchi: "And we thought Washu did that!"
Misty: "What about the spelling?"
Jim: "Spell check says that only TV is wrong."
Rest: "We HOPE that's all that's misspelled!"

> "Everyone to my lab!  I need to show you my newest creation!"
> Everyone groaned and got up.  Tenchi hung back away from Washu.  She
>was still after him to be her guniea pig.

All: "D'OH!" >_<

> "But it was my favorite show Washu!"  Ryoko complained.  "And I
>actually got to sit next to Tenchi!"
> Washu turned to her.  "Ryoko?"
> "What?"  Ryoko said grumpily.
> "Call me mom!"
> Ryoko groaned and continued to follow Washu down to her lab.  They
>all crowded around a big machine.
> Sasami looked at the machine, then Washu.  "Is this why you missed
>lunch Washu?"
> "I missed lunch?  I must've been working so hard that I forgot
>about!  I'm sorry Sasami."

Jim: "Now this is the way a story should be written.  Just the right balance of 
dialog and story lines."
Tenchi: "What did Washu forget about?"
Ayeka: "Washu misses everything 'cause she hates to be with us commoners."

> "Don't worry, I saved you some!"
> "Thank you Sasami."
> "What is this thing Little Washu?"  asked Tenchi, clearly wanting to
>get out of her lab.

Tenchi: "Her lab isn't that bad.  Besides, it pays to have the most brilliant 
mind in the universe living in your house."
Jim: "Yeah, but wait 'til she hears about Mihoshi."
Tenchi and Ayeka: "Oh crap."

> "This is my newest invention!  Its called the InterAnime Transporter,
>or IAT.  It can transport people from other anime here!"
> Mihoshi stepped forward to take a good look, but true to her nature,
>she tripped.  She grabbed part of the IAT for support, accidentally
>hitting a big red button.............

Mihoshi (from Jim's quarters): "I AM NOT THAT STUPID!  I AM A SMART PERSON . . . 
oh god . . . BBBBAAAAAAARRRRRRRFFFFFFFF!"
Jim: "Take it easy, sweetie."
Ayeka: "Ah, the joys of pregnancy."
Rest: "Clean up, aisle seven."

> "Mihoshi!"  Washu screamed.
> But the machine started up anyway.  There was a low whirring sound
>and a flash of light.  When it was over, there were six more people in
>Washu's lab.

Tenchi: "So?  Her lab only covers the surface area of five planets.  There 
should be enough room for about five hundred trillion people."
Ash and Misty: O_O'
Ayeka: "Oh yeah, you haven't seen her lab yet, have you?"

> "What happened?  Who are you guys?"  a tall blonde guy asked.
> Washu looked up at him in amazement.  "It worked!  It worked!  I am

>*such* a genius!!!!"
> She ran up to him and smiled her little girl smile.  "Hiya!  I'm
>Little Washu, the greatest scientific genius in the universe!  You're
>cute!  Do you want to be my guniea pig?"  she said, looking him over.

All: "NO!  YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE HER GUINEA PIG!"
Jim: "And I spelled it right . . . YES!"

> "Um................."
> "These are my friends!"  Washu continued.  "This is my daughter
>Ryoko, Jurian Princess Aeka, her little sister Sasami, Kiyone, my
>personal pain in the neck Mihoshi, grandfather Yosho, his son
>Noboyuki, Noboyuki's son and my *former* guniea pig Tenchi!"
> Tenchi let out a sigh of relief.  Former was the word he had wanted
>to hear.

Ayeka: "WTF?  Even MY name gets F.U.B.A.R?!"
Jim: "Don't feel too bad, Ayeka.  I've seen people misspell Sasami for cryin' 
out loud."
Tenchi: "Kiyone . . . is this taken from the TV universe?"
Jim: "I would HOPE so . . . any Tokyo episodes in this theatre WILL be THROWN 
out the airlock!" (Yes, "Diabolo", I have a problem with Sakuya.  What of it?)
Rest: "HEAR, HEAR!"

> "Um......hi.  My  name is Goku.  This is my wife Chi-Chi, our son
>Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, and *our* scientist Bulma."

Jim: "Hmmm . . ." walks back to his quarters.
Tenchi: "What?  Where did he go?"
Mihoshi (from inside their quarters): "WHAT?!  NOT WITH BULMA!  SHE'S TOO MUCH 
LIKE WASHU!  But Chi-Chi on the other hand . . ."
Jim (walking back into the room): "Oh yeah, we're gonna have fun tonight . . . 
hehehe."
Rest: "WHAT THE?!"
Jim: "I won't say until I talk to Chi-Chi." (Turns around and leaves again.)

> Washu rushed over to Bulma with gleaming eyes.
> "You're a scientist?  Me too!"
> "Yeah....but aren't you a little young to be the 'greatest scientific
>genius in the universe'?  What are you?  11?  12?"
> "No silly!  Like I said, I'm the a genius!  So I can make myself
>*appear* young."

Tenchi: "And the continuities cross paths.  Washu is twenty thousand in our 
universe, but in TV land, she IS twelve."
Ash and Misty: "TWENTY THOU . . ." (they pass out)
Tenchi smacks the MEDIC button, stopping the fic temporarily.

Meanwhile, in the Captain's ready room . . .

Jim had the Comm Officer place a call to Chi-Chi's house, then send it into the 
ready room.
Jim: "HEY!  CHI-CHI!  How's it goin'?"
Chi-Chi: "Hey Jim.  Long time, no hear."
Jim: "I'm sorry about that, I really am.  Life just decided to start moving 
ultra fast.  Listen, can you come to the Eagle?"
Chi-Chi: "I can try.  Where are you?"
Jim: "Currently, we're in orbit of Endor.  The crew is getting a much needed 
rest."
Chi-Chi: "Alrighty then, I'll be there in about thirty hours.  I really need to 
talk to you."
Jim: "I'll be here, waitin' for you."  With that, he closed the channel.

Back in the theatre . . .

Ash and Misty were revived, and brought up to speed in the Tenchi OAV universe.  
And just as Jim walked in, the fic started again.

>"Oh.....um....okay...."

All: O_O "PERFECT TIMING!"

> "Let's go!"  Washu said grabbing Bulma's wrist and dragging her off
>into the lab.
> Ryoko laid her head on Tenchi's shoulder.
> "Just what I need Tenchi!  More women to distract you from me!"
> But at the same time, Tenchi was thinking  <Yes!  More men to
>distract her from me!>
>Aeka did not like this.

Jim: "Oh, boo-hoo.  I think she's gotten over that jealousy phase.  Right, 
Ayeka?"
Ayeka: "You better believe it."

> "Ryoko!  Don't bother Lord Tenchi with your foolishness!  Tenchi
>obviously loves *me*!"
> "No way little princess!"
> "This is the last time you...you demon!  Never again will you have
>the chance to bug Lord Tenchi!"
> Ryoko stepped forward until she was just inches from Aeka.   "Is that
>a challenge?"
> "Yeah!"
>Tenchi stepped between the two girls.  "Ryoko!  Aeka!  We have
>guests!"

Tenchi: "Like that would stop you anyway.  I can remember a few times when a 
guest came over, and BOOM! There goes the house."

>Ryoko walked turned away from Aeka and said "Your time will come
>Princess."  and disappeared.
>"Hmph!"  Aeka said snottily, walking out of the lab.
>"Why don't you go take a walk around the grounds."  Tenchi suggested
>to Chi-Chi.  "You could go see the shrine."
>"Or the onsen!"  Noboyuki put in.
>Chi-Chi gave him a disgusted look and marched out of the lab.

Jim: "When did anybody show anybody just where in the lab the door to the house 
is?"
Tenchi: "I don't know, and that worries me."
Ash: "Why?"
Ayeka: "Washu has several doors in the lab that go to several locations in 
multiple dimensions."
Ash and Misty: "Oh . . . I see . . ."

>Yosho and Noboyuki had to go do their own things at the shrine, so
>they too, left.
>Kiyone frowned and slapped her forehead.  "I almost forgot!  Mihoshi
>and I have a shift at the diner!  See you guys at dinner!"
>Sasami watched them leave and then smiled at Gohan.  "Do you like
>video games Gohan?"
>"Yeah!"
>"I have a couple upstairs!  Wanna go play 'em?"
>"Sure!"
>"Okay!  Race you!"
>Gohan and Sasami raced out of the lab, Ryoki running behind them.
>This left Tenchi, Goku, Vegeta, and Piccolo.
>"Let's get out of here!"  Tenchi said.

Jim: "What's with the emotion, Tenchi?"
Tenchi: "I don't know."
Ash: "Maybe it's because you're a wuss?"
Jim: "Hey now!  NO fighting ALLOWED!  Wait a minute . . . how do you misspell 
Ryo-Ohki?"

>"Okay."  Goku agreed.  "Its creepy in here."
>"Its creepier when Washu wants you to be her
>guniea pig!  So if I were you, I'd watch out!"

All: "Oh, boo-hoo!  Cry me a river, and I'll build you a bridge . . . AND THEN 
I'LL BURN IT!"

>They sat down in the living room.
>"Do those girls always swarm all over you?"  Goku asked.
>"Yeah."
>"The Ladies Man!"

Jim: "Ladies man?  Not bloody likely.  He just kept that old image to fool 
people into thinking that he was gay or something."
Tenchi: "Yeah, you got me there.  I was just too much of a nice guy."
Ayeka: "Is that why it took you long enough to decide?"
Tenchi: "Yep.  And it's why I chose the both of you."
Ash and Misty: O_O "WTF?!"
Jim: "Yeah, he has two wives, what of it?"

>"I wish I weren't!"

Ayeka: "TENCHI!  Is this true?"
Tenchi: "HELL NO!  If it was, would we have (indicates his son) junior here?"

>"Oh come on!  If  you had to spend a day with Chi-Chi's nagging, you
>would be crawling back here!"

Jim: "Chi-Chi should be here soon . . ."
Rest: "YOU INVITED HER HERE?!"
Jim: "Yes I did.  But she won't be MSTing much of this fic."

>"I can say the same for Ryoko and Aeka's fighting!"
>"Chi-Chi could be a one woman army."  Piccolo said.

Jim: "No argument there, bud.  When she gets pissed, look out!"

>"Thats why *I* never got hitched."  Vegeta said.  "The last thing I
>need is a woman controlling me!"
>"So, you guys fight any good battles?"  Tenchi asked, changing the
>subject.
>"Here we go."  Piccolo muttered under his breath.

All: "Oh for crying out loud!  Goku doesn't REALLY like to brag, he's just 
trying to be macho!"
Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to the bridge, incoming civilian shuttle."
Jim: "That must be Chi-Chi."
Rest: "AH CRAP!"
Jim leaves the theatre.

>Goku was nearly out of his seat.  "Oh man!  Tons!  Okay...it was us
>versus Frieza on Piccolo's home planet Namek........."
>Goku talked on and on, Vegeta adding his own bits and pieces.  A
>sweatdrop appeared on Tenchi's forehead.
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Tenchi: "Is that Washu's improbability theory?"
Ayeka: "I think it's supposed to be a scene change, but I can't be certain."
Ash: "Looks like a really long censored swear word."

>"So Washu....uh....Little Washu.  Explain to me how this works."
>Bulma said pointing to the IAT.
>"Gladly!  The IAT transports others to here.  But in your place, time
>has completely stopped."
>"What a machine!  Can you *show* me how it works?"
>Washu pushed a couple of buttons, explaining what she did as she did
>it.
>After the familiar noise and light, a young man appeared on the
>floor.
>"Huh?"  he asked.
>"Trunks!"  Bulma exclaimed.

Tenchi: "Why the creators of DBZ named a boy after a pair of shorts is beyond 
me."
Ayeka: "Well, it does give them some room to work with.  You'd have Briefs, 
Boxers, Speedos, Pants and the like."
Ash: "Now that would be a meeting.  'Briefs, this is Trunks.  Trunks, Briefs."

>"Mom?  What am I doing here?  Here I am talking to someone and next
>thing I know, I'm here!"
>Bulma explained to Trunks about where he was, what happened, and the
>people who lived here.
>"Did you say lots of girls?"

Tenchi and Ayeka: "Oh no . . . not another Bud Bundy."
Ash and Misty: "Oh no . . . not another Brock."

>"Yeah!"
>Washu smiled.  "I have just the girl for you.....on one
>condition.........."
>"Which is?"
>"You call me Little Washu!"
>"Easy enough!"
>Washu closed her eyes and called to Ryoko through their mind link,
>telling her of a handsome young man who wanted to me her.
>Sure enough, Ryoko appeared, startling Trunks.  Taking one look at
>him, she forgot the love she once had for Tenchi.

Tenchi: "HA!  Like she would fall head over heels for him, in the time span of a 
few seconds."
Misty: "How long did it take with you?"
Tenchi: "Five minutes."
Jim (from his quarters): "Chi-chi, this is Mihoshi.  My future wife and mother 
of my child."
Chi-chi: (What she says is too faint to hear.)
Mihoshi: (Again, too faint to hear.)
Chi-Chi: "THIS IS WHAT YOU CALLED ME HERE FOR?!"
Jim: "It's her idea, Chi-Chi.  Just think of it as a change of pace."

>Trunks stared right back at her.  He had never seen anything more
>beautiful.  He looked deep into her golden eyes.
>"You must be Ryoko."  he said awkwardly.
>"Yeah."
>"You're very beautiful."
>"She gets that from me!"  Washu insisted.
>Ryoko rolled her eyes and walked over to Trunks.  "Whaddya say we
>blow this popsicle stand?"
>"I'm with you!"
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Misty: "There it is again.  What is it?"
Tenchi: "I don't know, but Popsicle's sound good right now."
Jim (in his quarters): "Chi-Chi, let me ask you a question?  Do you like . . . 
pie? (She answers) Well, dive right in!  And you can have some Strudel, too!"
Chi-Chi and Mihoshi: "OH, YOU'RE A NAUGHTY ONE!"
Tenchi: "HEY JIM!  SHUT THE DAMN DOOR!"
Rest: "AH!  We wanted to hear them!"
Jim: "YE-HA!  TWO AT ONCE!"

>Chi-Chi had finished looking at the cave where Ryoko had been
>imprisoned.  She wondered about what was or had been behind the iron
>gates.  She stood for awhile, pondering, but then decided to go to the
>onsen.

Tenchi (something clicks in his brain): "Now I KNOW this is wrong.  The onsen is 
over the lake in our universe.  Ryoko was in the cave in OUR universe.  Kiyone 
is DEAD in our UNIVERSE."
Ash: "And your point is what?"
Tenchi: "I don't know."
Misty: "That . . . is a . . ."
Rest (as Xellos Nazi): "SHUT UP!  NO XELLOS FOR YOU!"

>It took her awhile to find it, but eventually she did.  She walked
>inside and found Aeka.
>"Hello Princess Aeka."
>"Hello.  How is your stay going."
>"Wonderful.  Its peaceful here."  Chi-Chi said sliding into the
>water.  "I see you like Tenchi."

Tenchi: "Now wait a minute.  Did she just get into the bath with her clothes 
on?"
Ayeka: "Do we care?  No.  And since when are questions like that spoken as 
statements?"
Misty: "Well, there is the stating of the obvious, you know."
Jim (from in his room): "CHI-CHI!  YOU'RE A WILD ONE!  I WONDER IF THIS IS WHAT 
THEY CALL RHUBARB!  MIHOSHI IS EATING STUDEL!  I WANT PIE!  THIS IS SO COOL!  
WHOA!!!"
Rest: '-_-

>"Very much Miss Chi-Chi."
>"He looks like he woud make a good husband."
>>"Yes.....what is it like to have a husband?"
>"With Goku, it can be wonderful, but scary.  He is so sweet, but then
>he drags Gohan off to some battle.  He doesn't realize that I'm scared
>to death of those battles!  I'm afraid one day he won't come home!"

All: "AAAwwww.  Isn't that just so sweet?"
Tenchi: "That's why I have my wives fight by my side."
Ash: "Speaking of, where's your Ryoko?"
Tenchi: "Just think of my family as rabbits.  We MULTIPLY."
Misty: "You've been busy."

>Aeka gave Chi-Chi a comforting smile.  "There has been times when
>Lord Tenchi has fought too.  I know how scary it is thinking the one
>you love could die."
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Ayeka: "I really go in depth in that one, didn't I?"
Tenchi: "Forget that, I'm seeing a pattern here.  I think this author LIKES 
you."
Ash: "!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*() too you to, pal!"
Misty: "What was that for?"
Ash: "Shits and giggles my dear."

>Sasami laughed in triumph as she defeated Gohan for the tenth time.
>"I never knew a person who could beat me at this game!"  Gohan mused.

>Sasami smiled and checked her watch.  "I'd love to win more Gohan,
>but I have dinner to cook."
>"Thats okay Sasami.  I'll go and keep you company."
>The two ran down to the kitchen, passing Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta, and
>Tenchi in a blur.

All (singing): "AH YES THEY CALL THEM THE STREAK!"

>Piccolo was snoring away, and Vegeta had lost interest, but Goku
>continued on, recounting every detail of every fight.
>Goku stopped talking to watch Sasami and Gohan.
>"Awwww!" Goku said laughing.  "The little guy's in love!"

Ayeka: "He seems much nicer than . . . what's his name?  Zero?"
Tenchi: "Ah, now I remember.  The one where we all die, without even so much as 
any air time."

>"Females," Vegeta sneered.  "The number one weakness!"

Chi-Chi (from Jim's quarters): "I KNOW THAT VOICE!  WHAT IS THAT PIECE OF SHIT 
DOING ON THIS SHIP?!"
Jim (yelling into the theatre): "GUYS!  FIND COVER!  INCOMING CHI-CHI!"
Chi-Chi barges in, wearing one of Jim's oversized shirts.  The MSTers are hiding 
behind the chairs, not wanting to get in her way.
Jim and Mihoshi soon enter, both wearing almost nothing.
Jim: "Chi-Chi, calm down.  The people in here were just riffing a story that had 
you guys in it."
Chi-Chi: "Then where's your MSTers?"
Jim: "Come on out, guys."
The MST crew pops out of hiding, and Chi-Chi looks each of them over.
Chi-Chi: "Oh, okay.  Sorry for stopping the story."
The three head back to Jim's quarters.

>"You said it!"  Tenchi agreed.

Tenchi: "I DID NOT!  DO NOT PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH!"

>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()
>"Dinnertime!"  Sasamia called awhile later.
>Kiyone and Mihoshi entered the house, just as everyone was crowding
>around the table.  Kiyone leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.

Ayeka: "I see your point, Tenchi.  The continuities have indeed mixed into one.  
And it seems that Jim was right too.  Sasami's name is NOT SASAMIA!  That sounds 
like a city it TEXAS!"
Tenchi: "That's a bad thing.  The fourth wall is in danger."
Jim (from down the hall): "Really, Chi-Chi?  You're going to divorce Goku and 
come live here?  What do you think Mihoshi?"  The rest of the conversation is 
cut off as the door to Jim's quarters closes.

>"I'm so exhausted!"  she said wearily.
>"Hard day Kiyone?"  Sasami asked.

Ash and Misty: "You're right, the fourth wall is in serious danger."
Jim (charging back into the room): "FOURTH WALL?!  Computer, analyze fourth 
wall."
Computer: "Fourth wall is at sixty percent and falling."
Jim: "SHIT!  Computer, is there a way to reinforce the wall?"
Computer: "Just don't make any bad jokes, and you'll make it out with ten 
percent left in the wall."
Jim: "You heard her.  No bad jokes or puns.  We're cutting this one CLOSE."  
(Leaves again.)

>"Yeah."

All: "NO SHIT, SHERLOCK!"

>Tenchi looked over to Washu.  "Um......Little Washu."
>"Yes?"
>"How are we going to fit everyone at this table?"
>Washu gave him a big grin.  "Just leave it to the greatest scientific
>genius in the universe!"
>Her Washu-bots appeared on her shoulders.

"South Texas Death Ride" can be heard coming out of Jim's quarters, and there is 
a lot of head banging going on.  The Eagle herself starts vibrating from the 
impromptu mosh pit that the song created.
All: Start singing to the song, and begin thrashing about. 

>"Leave it to Washu!"  A said.
>"She's a genius!"  B exclaimed.

Tenchi: "Damn those bots.  Why can't they just stay dead?"
Ash: "Are you implying that you killed them?"
Tenchi: "DAMN!" >_<

>Washu gave Bulma a friendly wink as her holo computer appeared in
>front of her.
>She punched a few keys and the table disappeared and was replaced by
>a new, longer one that was already set.  Everyone sat down as Sasami
>brought the food over.
>Soon, everyone was talking to everyone else, causing the room to be
>filled with joyful chatter.  Washu would type a little on her holo
>computer, say something, and then join the conversation.

Misty (as Washu): "I don't wanna say something."
Tenchi: "Why not?"

>"Washu..."  Tenchi began.
>"Ah ah ah!  *Little* Washu"  Washu interuppted.

Tenchi: "Did Washu just have an orgasm?"
Ayeka: "So that's what a fake orgasm is supposed to be like."

>"Um....Little Washu, what are you doing?"
>"I'm creating rooms for our guests to stay in."
>Tenchi nodded.

Ash: "Tenchi nodded off, and woke up at the end of this fic."
Tenchi: "That's not such a bad idea."
Jim (from his quarters): "YOU STAY AWAKE IN THERE!"

>After dinner, Washu showed them the extra rooms.
>"Am I a *genius* or what?!"
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Tenchi: "That is really starting to freak me out."
Ayeka: "Try to ignore it as you would ignore . . ."
Jim (just outside the theatre): "YOU FINISH THAT, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME!"
Chi-Chi: "And me."
Rest: O_O "Hi Chi-Chi."
Mihoshi: "And ME!"
MSTers: ">_<" "We're sorry!"

>Washu sighed.  For the past week, the Masaki house had been
>peaceful.  For once, no fights.

Tenchi and Ayeka (look at each other, then back at the fic, and back and forth a 
few more times): "Are you saying Washu's bored because we STOPPED FIGHTING?!"
Jim: "Nah.  She just wants your Strudel."
Ayeka: "Well, she'll have to find that Strudel somewhere else."
Ash: "What does that mean?"
Rest (minus Misty): "You don't know?"
Misty: "He wouldn't know if I reached the 'Clouds and Rain'."
All: @_@ "You're a dumbass, Ash."

>She was working alongside Bulma.  They both knew that the two groups
>wouldn't be able to stay together forever, but they wished they
>could.  So they worked on new inventions to keep their minds off their
>worries.
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Jim: "Did this story just take a nosedive?"
Ash: "Yeah.  The climax turned out to be a mole hill."

>Ryoko and Trunks walked into the house.  Ryoko was excited.  Her
>excitement flooded into Washu's head through their mind link, causing
>her to run up to Ryoko.
>"Ryoko!  You can't be this excited and not tell me why!"
>"First you have to get everyone in here!  Especially Aeka, heh heh."
>"Oh come on!  Tell me tell me tell me!"
>"You can wait."

Jim: "Does that whining remind you guys of the last DBZ crossover we did?"
Rest (minus Chi-Chi): "Yeah.  Looks like we owe you twenty bucks."
Jim: "Ah, the easiest way to make eighty smackers."
Chi-Chi: "What other crossover?"
Jim: "Here, read this . . . (hands her MST #1)"

>"Oh okay."  Washu said disappointedly.  Her holo computer appeared
>and she typed half heartedly.  Everyone appeared. looking confused.

Tenchi: "Gee, I wonder why."
Jim: "Sarcasm will get you nothing."
Ash: "But a swift kick in the ass."

>"All easy for the greatest scientific genius in the universe."


>"Oh....its just Washu."  Kiyone said as the Washu-bots appeared on
>Washu's shoulders wearing little pink cheerleading outfits.

All: "What the hell is that?  Chibi-Cheerleaders?!"
Jim (pulls out his October issue of Playboy, with the SEC cheerleaders): "Now 
THESE are cheerleaders."

>"Go Washu, go Washu!  You're a genius, you're a genius........"  the
>sang.
>Washu danced a little to their song, but turned immediatly serious,

All: Face-vault.

>remembering Ryoko's news.
>"What are we here for?"  Tenchi asked.
>"Ryoko has some news."  Washu explained.  "What is it Ryoko?"
>Ryoko smiled at Trunks.
>"We're in love!"  Trunks said.

Tenchi: "And that came out of left field.  There wasn't very much in the way of 
what they were doing."
Jim: "Trust me, I don't think we wanna know what they were doing.  Probably 
mixing pie and Strudel."
Ayeka: "Making Rhubarb?"
Jim (eyeballing a very red Chi-Chi and Mihoshi): "I plead the fifth, but Rhubarb 
IS a pie.  You and Ryoko could make Rhubarb."
Tenchi: "And who says they don't?"
Rest (minus Ayeka and Tenchi): Face-vault.


>"And we're getting married."  Ryoko added.

Jim: "Okay.  I guess if you wanted to make a short story like this, you would 
leave out the details on their relationship."
Girls: "This might've been written by a MALE!  WE WANT THE DETAILS!"
Jim: "Ah crap, here we go . . ."

>Everyone was silent, then everything started at once.

BOOM!  KERPLINK!  SHAZAM!  FOOM!  BOING!
Jim: "And it stopped in a nasty accident."
Rest (minus Little Jim, who's in his crib, and Mihoshi for the obvious reason . 
. . she got sick): Are a tangled mess of arms and legs on the floor.

>Washu and Bulma rushed up to congratulate their children.
>Tenchi silently thanked Trunks.  Mihoshi started to sing about a
>wedding.  Aeka stood up and laughed her high-pitched laugh.
>"Now Tenchi is mine!"
>Vegeta looked to Tenchi.  "Don't fall in love man.  It'll be your
>worst mistake!"

Tenchi: "Do you want some CD's?  Here, CD's NUTS!"
Ash: "Marriage isn't that bad."
Jim: "I'm staying out of this one."

>Aeka looked at Vegeta angrily.

Ayeka: "And the reason for that would be what?"

>"Its too late Vegeta!  Tenchi already *does* love me, don't you
>Tenchi?"
>"Um............"
>Ryoko looked from Bulma to Washu and shuddered.  They were already
>discussing some kind of invention that would make wedding planning
>easier.
><Oh great.  *Two* scientific geniuses for mothers.>

Tenchi: "FA!  Washu's inventions would make anything Bulma made seem like 
ancient artifacts."
Chi-Chi: "Bulma's a putz, anyway."
At the word putz, the group breaks out the mini-golf putters, and start taking 
practice shots.
Chaos farted, belched and scratched his nuts.

>Mihoshi yawned and said  "I'm sleepy!  Can we go to bed now?"
>No one heard her.  Every one was engaged in watching Aeka and Vegeta
>trying to outdo eachother.

Guys: "FIGHT!"
Girls: "INSENSITIVE MALE!"

>"Have *you* ever fallen in love Vegeta?"
>"Yeah."
>"You have?"
>"Yeah!"
>"What happened?"
>Vegeta jerked his thumb in Trunks' direction.  "Kids."

Jim: "NOW JUST WAIT A DAMN MINUTE!  YOU DO NOT USE KIDS AS AN EXCUSE FOR 
ANYTHNG!"
Vegeta: "What of it, puge?"
Jim (gets out the lightsaber): "BRING IT, PAINT BRUSH HEAD!  I'LL UNLEASH CHI-
CHI ON YOU!"
Vegeta: "She couldn't hurt a fly."
Jim (to Chi-Chi): "Vegeta here is insulting Gohan."
Rest: (Run for cover.)
Chi-Chi and Vegeta proceed to beat the living hell out of each other for a few 
minutes.  Chi-Chi wins by a mile.

>Aeka smirked.  "Heh heh!  Almighty Vegeta can't handle the pitter
>patter of little feet!"
>The *whole* gang was now watching the two.  They all burst out
>laughing at Aeka's wit.
>Watching Aeka and Ryoko fight was annoying, but watching these two
>fight was just plain ol' amusing!
>"What do *you* know about kids you nitwit?"

Jim: "Oh nnnooo!  Not the 'you don't know shit about kids' fight!"

>"Nitwit?!  Azaka......Kamidake........."
>The two guardians appeared beside her.
>"Aeka, not in the living room!"  Tenchi yelled.
>"Everyone duck!"  Washu exclaimed.

All: "NOT IN THE HOUSE!  YOU COULD BREAK SOMETHING!"

>Everyone got on the floor and covered their heads.  They weren't
>stupid.  They knew what was coming.
>"Yes Miss Aeka?"  Kamidake asked.
>"Attack him!"  Aeka ordered.

Chi-Chi: "Too bad I already pounded him into the ground."
Jim: "Think about how you phrased that."
Rest: "SHUT UP!"

>"Yes Ma'am."
>The two guardians powered up.  Vegeta just smiled.
>"All right!  Now were talking!
>Gaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccc Guuuuuuuuuuuuuuunn!"
>Trunks stepped between Aeka and Vegeta.  "Dad!"  he shouted.  "Don't
>you *ever* hit a girl!"

All: "YOU GO TRUNKS!"

>Vegeta stopped his blast and Aeka stopped the guardians.  Vegeta
>turned to Aeka.  "You're lucky this time princess!"  he sneered.
>"I think its time we got to bed."  Bulma said softly.
>Everyone else agreed and hurried out of the room.
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Jim: "Everybody take five minutes.  My back hurts."
The MSTers leave the theatre, for a nice stretch.
Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to the bridge."
Jim: "What now?"

Once on the bridge, Jim found out just what was going on.
Selphie: "Sir, we just received notice that one of the old prison ships has not 
reported in for some time.  We're to investigate."
Jim: "Crap.  Which ship is it?"
Selphie (looks embarrassed by the name): "The TeaCup, sir."
Jim: "Well, they'll just have to wait.  Tell Command that the port nacelle 
started leaking drive plasma, and we're repairing."
Chief Engineer: "Sir, there's nothing wrong with the port nacelle."
Jim (gives him the 'go along with it' look): "How long will repairs take?"
Chief Engineer (notices the look): "Repairs will take up to thirty hours, sir."
Jim: "You heard the man, Selphie. Relay to Command.  And you have the Conn."

Jim heads down below, and meets up with the group.  They were in ten forward, 
enjoying the view of Endor.
Jim: "Let's get this over with.  I have the feeling that we're about to go lawn 
pig hunting."

So back into the theatre they went.

>A few days later, Washu and Bulma were standing in front of Ryoko and
>Trunks with a large book in their hands.

Tenchi: "I never knew that Washu had a Bible in her lab."
Jim: "Well, that must be both old and new testaments to be THAT big."
Ayeka: "Well, you learn something new every day."

>"This is our invention to help you plan the wedding!  With this,
>you'll be able to get married sooner!"
>"What is it?"  Trunks asked.
>"Its our Do-It-Yourself-Wedding-Made-Easy-Book."  Washu explained.

Jim, Tenchi and Ayeka: "Oh well, I tried."
Ash and Misty (twiddling thumbs): "Is this story rebuilding the climax in mid 
stride?"
Chi-Chi (talking to Mihoshi, who's staying out in the hall): "So, what's it like 
to have a man who cares?"
Chaos went to the bathroom twenty minutes ago, and it still smells in there.

>"With this book you can pick a time, date, and place for your wedding,
>design your own decorations, dresses and tuxes, pick a preacher, order
>food, everything!  Instead of it taking months to plan the wedding,
>you can plan it within a day!"

Girls (with the big 'love' eyes): "I WANT ONE!"
Guys: "Ah hell, now we get nothing."

>"Wow thanks guys!"  Ryoko exclaimed.
>"Yeah!"  Trunks agreed.  "We won't have to wait to be married!"
>Washu smiled and looked to Ryoko.
>"What is it Washu?"
>"Ryoko!  For crying out loud, CALL ME MOM!"
>"Okay okay!"

Jim (as baseball announcer): "The Comma, with . . . the whiff."
Ash: "What?"
Jim: "The comma wasn't there . . . it struck out."
Tenchi: "Oh . . . we thought it was a bad fart joke."

>Washu looked at Bulma.  "They grow up so fast!"
>"They do."  Bulma agreed.
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Jim: "You better believe that we young folk grow up fast.  But I'd gladly trade 
it in to be seventeen again . . ."
Tenchi (looks at Ayeka): "Boy, I hope we have more emotion than that when our 
kids get older."
Ayeka: "Yeah, I mean, where's the tears?" 

>A month later, Washu cried 

Jim: "You wanted tears, there you go."

>silently as Ryoko walked up the aisle in her stunning dress.  Trunks stood 
>proudly, watching her.  Washu was Ryoko's Best Maid, which pleased her.  
>Mihoshi, Kiyone, and even Aeka were also Bride's Maids.  Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, 
>and Piccolo were Trunks' Best Men.

Tenchi: "Stunning dress?  What did it look like?"
Jim: "I think Trunks forgot his pants."
Ash: "So Trunks is in his Briefs?"



>The couple said there vows, and finally, sealed the deal with a
>kiss.  Washu watched sadly as the limo drove off.  She and Bulma had
>created a large home for the happy couple to live in as a wedding
>present.  It was in the woods near the Masaki home.  At least her
>daughter would be close.....but it would never be the
>same................
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()

Jim: "Wouldn't be the same?  What, the Mihoshi and Kiyone in that universe 
making Rhubarb isn't entertainment enough?"
Tenchi: "At least it WILL keep Washu away from my Strudel."
Rest: "True."

>Everyone gathered together in Washu's lab to see the guests off.
>Washu walked up to Bulma.

Ash: "So much for the second climax."
Jim: "This story is as flat as a board."

>"Here Bulma.  These are for you."
>A pair of Bulma-bots took their places on her shoulders.

All: "MOTHER OF GOD!  NOT MORE OF THOSE DAMN THINGS!"
Jim: "The bots figured out how to multiply like Tenchi."
Rest: O_O . . . >_< . . . -_- . . . @_@'
Jim: "Do I detect a sensory overload?"
Tenchi: "Nah.  Just a bad joke."
Chaos called, said he made new bots.

>"Bulma is the greatest!"  A said.
>"She is the best!"  B agreed.
>"Come visit anytime."  Tenchi said laughing.
>Washu waved sadly and pressed a button on the IAT.  Trunks waved his
>goodbye as the six people disappeared.
>!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()!@#$%^&*()
>Epilogue................

Jim: "Ah, look at that . . . almost there."
Tenchi: "Finally.  But since there is almost no details to the story, it won't 
take long to finish."

>Goku, Vegeta, Chi-Chi, Bulma, Gohan, and Piccolo all returned to
>their own places.  They explained Trunks' disappearance.  But they all
>returned to visit once a month.

Ayeka: "How could they do that?"
Jim: "Never question the fic.  It just means that MORE will appear."
Tenchi: "So the less sense a fic makes, the better off we are?"
Jim: "You know it.  Less drawl to get through."

>Aeka and Tenchi soon fell in love and were married.  Gohan and Sasami
>were in love too, but waited for awhile before they got married.
>(Teehee)
>Aeka convinced Chi-Chi to talk to Goku about her fears.  She did and
>Goku completely understood.

Chi-Chi: "Just like Zoolander understands the world of technology."
Jim: "Do I detect a note of sarcasm on that voice?"
Chi-Chi: "Oh yeah."
Tenchi: "What about us?"
Jim: "Why?  You and Ayeka ended up where you are now."
Ayeka: "Remember, details."
It was found that Chaos plugged the toilet, with a bunch of those bots.

>Everything had been peaceful since the guests had come to stay with
>them.  And it still was.  Washu had a feeling it would be peaceful for
>a loooooooooooonnnnnng time....................

>THE END

>Like I said, this is my first crossover fic!  If you have any
>questions or comments or anything, let me know at
>iamabrat@voyager.net
>Thanks!

Chi-Chi walks out of the room, towards Jim's quarters where Mihoshi is waiting.
Jim: "Review time, folks.  What did you think?"
Tenchi: "Ryoko was OOC.  It actually took most of my life, with her in the cave, 
to fall in love with me.  Then the story sank."
Ayeka: "Sank?  It never really got out of the docks."
Jim: "That shallow?"
Ayeka: "Details."
Ash: "This story reminds me of a bowl.  The high points were at the beginning, 
and at the end.  But the middle seemed to have farted, deflated, and took it's 
sweet time refilling."
Misty: "It did have it's moments.  There was sweetness, but also a tart taste 
left by lack of details in the right spots."
Jim: "Alright, dismissed."

Jim headed for the bridge, not even mingling with the MSTers.
Jim: "Number One, is the crew aboard?"
First Officer: "Yes, sir.  We can depart at any time."
Jim: "Very good.  Helm, break orbit.  Set course 115 mark 19.  Speed, warp 
nine."
Selphie: "Course and speed laid in, sir."
Jim: "Engage."

The Millennium Eagle turns, and is gone in a flash of light.  But somewhere out 
there is the TeaCup, and they will have to be dealt with sooner or later . . .

Chaos looked up from Endor, and saw that his ride had left him . . .
