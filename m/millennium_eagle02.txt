Disclaimer: Except for me, I don't own any of the characters used in this FF.  
No money is passing hands here, no need to sue.  This is a MST of a short lemon, 
so those of you who find this stuff offensive or are underage . . . beat feet 
and make a hasty retreat.  I've decided that Selphie is a permanent member.

The Millennium Eagle, MST-1071 cruises through the cosmos.  The Captain, Jim 
Ohki, receives a very interesting communiqu‚.  It seems that somebody has yet to 
get the hint, and wrote a Sasami lemon.

I think I got to it before Weber-san or Glyph, and if I didn't, well . . . then 
whatever.

Jim: "Comm, recall MST group minus Ayeka and Ryoko."
Comm Officer: "Aye, sir." Pause, "MST group is en route, sir.  ETA twenty 
hours."
Jim: "Good.  When they get here, have them assemble in the theatre."
Comm Officer: "Aye, Captain."

Twenty hours later . . .

Selphie (on speakers): "Captain to main theatre, MST group has arrived."

MSTers:
Jim and Mihoshi Ohki: Captain of the Eagle, if you wanna know how I got Mihoshi, 
read the lemon I wrote.
Tenchi Masaki: Reluctant MSTer, married to Ayeka, from OAV universe.
Ash and Misty Ketchum: Newly weds, fresh from their honeymoon, from Johto 
series.

Jim: "Let's get started."

>Tenchi Muyo! And all of the characters in this fan

>fiction is owned by AIC and Pioneer.  I own nothing,

>except for the story.  Please, don't sue me!

Tenchi: "Wow.  The first paragraph is spelled right."
Jim: "Just you wait, this story has . . . a LEMON scent to it."
Rest: "AH CRAP!" 

>Warning:  If you are underage, do NOT read this fic!

 

 

>Carrots Carrots Carrots

Mihoshi: "Oh crap, does this mean what I think it means?"
Jim: "I plead the fifth, but at least it is short."
Tenchi: "That doesn't make it any easier."

                                                               

>            "Hmm.what will I do?"  Sasami asked herself.  She had finished 
>breakfast a lot earlier than she expected.  She was getting bored and 
>impatient. 
>"I guess
>I'll have a snack."  She said.  While she was looking though the cupboard a 
>couple magazines fell out.  "Oh no I better clean this up."  She said as she 
>picked up a
>magazine.  "Oh!"  She shouted, looking at a porn magazine.

Tenchi: "HA!  Dad keeps those upstairs in his room, where even I can't find 
them"
Jim: "Hey, is that the October issue of Playboy?  With the SEC cheerleaders?  
Oh, that's right . . . I ALREADY HAVE IT!"
Ash: "Can I borrow it?"
Jim and Misty: "HELL NO!"
Jim: "Mihoshi looks . . . WOW . . . in a cheerleaders outfit."
Mihoshi blushes.

>            By this time she was bored enough to do anything, so she started 
>flipping through the pages.  She noticed that some women were pleasuring 
>themselves with
>food.

>            Then she noticed that she had some extra carrots.  So she picked it 
>up and started sucking on it.  This was getting her horny, she started thinking 
>of Tenchi,

Tenchi: "Jim, is this why you didn't want Ayeka or Ryoko here?"
Jim: "You know it.  We need to make sure this story gets farted on!"

>and she had seen his cock before when she saw Washu's video camera screens.  
>They had been placed in secret and she kept them a secret for her own reasons. 
>And since she had often watched them she knew what to do, with her body and 
>others.

Jim: "Like you guys would.  You know what?  *FART!*"
Tenchi: "AAAAhhhhhhhhhhhh, fart fresh lemon . . ."
Misty: "DAMN MAN!"
Mihoshi: "Feel better?"
Jim: "Not yet."

>            Sasami then remembered that Washu was recording all of this.  She 
>threw a towel on the camera making it look like an accident.  She then 
>continued
>sucking on the carrot.  

Jim: "Well, her eyesight should be damn good.  And I hear sucking on a carrot 
helps with dehydration." *FART*

>            By this time she was getting really horny.  She could feel her 
>panties getting wet, so she started rubbing herself.  She kept sucking and 
>rubbing.  She was
>about to have an orgasm when she stopped sucking, she slid her panties off and 
>penetrated her pussy.  Then she took the carrot and started pushing it in and 
>out,
>harder and faster.

Guys (bad infomercial): "THAT'S RIGHT, IT SLICES, IT DICES!  THIS CARROT 
SHREDDER MAKES TRILLIONS OF CARROT STRIPS FOR SALADS!"
Mihoshi: "So are you saying that Sasami is tossing her salad?"
All: Face-vault.

>            Ryo-ohki had been awakened by moaning coming from the kitchen, so 
>she went to investigate.  When she got there she was delighted by what she saw, 
>she
>could see a carrot appearing and disappearing, and she heard Sasami moaning and 
>saying "Oh yes! Oh yes!"  So Ryo-ohki ran towards the carrot and bit it.  She
>missed and got Sasami's Finger.

Tenchi: "I don't like the direction that this story is going."
Jim: "This story had a direction?" *FART, BELCH*
Ash: "WHOA!  What have you been eating?"
Jim: "No comment . . . ^_^"

>            "Ouch"  Sasami yelled in pain.  Then she noticed what Ryo-ohki 
>wanted.  "Oh I see, you want the carrots."  She got up and cut up a carrot in 
>small pieces. 
>She then sat down on the floor and gave a small piece to Ryo-ohki.  Then she 
>stuck the others in her pussy, sticking each one farther and farther back until 
>all of the
>carrot pieces were inside her.  "Come on come and get them Ryo-ohki, you 
>naughty girl."

Girls: "Please stop.  Emotions don't count in anything, even sex.  Must talk in 
monotone . . ."
Guys: "Talking in monotone will get the emotions across . . . to a wall, 
perhaps."

>            Ryo-ohki had already tasted a carrot covered with Sasami's pussy 
>juices.  And she loved it and wanted more.  So she dove right between Sasami's 
>legs, and she then reached in and grabbed one.

Tenchi: "I'm glad somebody forgot to say what was being grabbed . . . *FART*"
Jim: "Ryo-Ohki was grabbing the drain plug for this story, and tried to flush it 
down the toilet."

>            "Oh Ryo-ohki you are cheating, from now on you can only use your 
>mouth to get them.  Like bobbing for apples!  It will be fun!"  She said.  So 
>Ryo-ohki
>tried it, he couldn't get his head all the way in, Sasami was too tight.  Then 
>Ryo-ohki just stuck her paw in and out until she had about five carrot pieces.  
>"Oh I see,
>you can't get your head fully in."  Sasami said as she spread her legs wider 
>and pulled open her pussy lips.

Tenchi: "Is this Sasami from the Tokyo universe?  I thought Ryo-Ohki was 
female."
Jim: "Don't ask, don't smell . . . speaking of which." *FART, SPLURT*
Ash: "AH MAN, HE CRAPPED HIMSELF!"
Jim: "No, I didn't.  That just demonstrates how bad this fic is."

>            "Ok try again now, and remember no paws."  Said Sasami.  Ryo-ohki 
>then dived in and started biting and eating the carrots.  "Oh Ryo-ohki!  More! 
>More!"  Sasami screamed in pleasure.  By this time Ryo-ohki had already eaten 
>all of the carrots and was now just licking her pussy.  They both tasted the 
>same by this time.

Jim: "Hmmm . . . nah."
Mihoshi: "What?"
Jim leans over, and whispers into her ear.
Mihoshi blushes apple red.

>            Sasami was just about to orgasm when she heard:  "Sasami what are 
>you doing?"  Ayeka had screamed it.  "I wake up to screaming and moaning so I 
>come down stairs and you are.are.strutting your naked body for the whole world 
>to see!  And.and."

Tenchi: "Ah . . . I see a writer that throws periods around because he's 
aroused."
Jim: "I think this was written by a kid . . . adults write stuff that has a 
little taste."

>            "Having a whole tone of fun."  Ryoko interrupted.  "I'll have to 
>try that sometime"

Jim: "Yeah right . . ."

>            "What!?"  Ayeka screamed.

>            "What, your telling me that doesn't look like fun."

>            Sasami had been paying attention to both Ryo-ohki and her sister at 
>the same time, when Ryo-ohki bit her love button, causing Sasami to have the 
>biggest
>orgasm of her life.  She had masturbated quite a lot since she first found out 
>about Washu's cameras.

>            "What is going on here"  Tenchi asked.

Tenchi: "That's what I'd like to know . . ."

Jim: "Ah, the obligatory plug for MicroShit.  Speaking of shit, story review."
Tenchi: "Why bother?  It was written without use of a spell-check.  There was 
really no build up.  And Sasami?  For cryin' out loud, why Sasami?"
Mihoshi: "I reverted back to the blonde-bimbo act to avoid paying any attention 
to the fic."
Ash: "Room for improvement . . . enough room for a few planets."
Misty: "Total suckage.  Using a little girl as a sex object . . . the writer has 
to be just a few years older than her to even think about something like that."
Jim: "Alright, dismissed."

This was a MST, done for spite.  C'mon people, there's Kiyone . . . Mihoshi is 
MINE!  I guess if you follow TmiL2, then Ayeka is free.  BUT LEAVE SASAMI ALONE!

And with that, the Millennium Eagle jumps to transwarp, heading for her next 
adventure.
