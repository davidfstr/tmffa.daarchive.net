    Mihoshi's Got a Gun

Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
The Galaxy Police has come undone
They’re crazy to give her a gun
What were they thinkin to do?
What did the GP Marshal go through?
They said when Mihoshi graduated she’ll really be a star
But man, they didn’t realize Now that Mihoshi’s got a gun things ain’t never
gonna be the same.

Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
Her tour of duty’s just begun
All bad guys better be on the run
Just cause she got a gun
What did her granddaddy do?
He put Mihoshi through GP school
The man has got to be insane
They say he thought that she had enough of a mind to make it through, now
she’s overworked and stessed

Run away, run away from the girl, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the girl yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
Her tour of duty’s just begun
All bad guys better be on the run
What did her granddaddy do?
It’s Mihoshi’s last whoopdeedo
She had to hunt down Kagato and try to put a blast in his brain
She said if you move I’m gonna shoot and if I shoot its gonna really hurt

Run away, run away from the girl yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the girl yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away

Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
All bad guys better be on the run

Mihoshi’s got a gun
Her tour of duty’s just begun
Now all bad guys are on the run
Because Mihoshi’s got a gun
Mihoshi’s got a gun
Her tour of duty’s just begun
Now all bad guys are on the run
Mihoshi’s got a gun
