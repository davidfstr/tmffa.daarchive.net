Oh, I can just see it now... *dream sequence waves*

    Ayeka woke up gradually, from the kind of dream that leaves you with a warm
feeling inside.  Dreams of stars slowly passing by, summer winds blowing through
the tops of the large, comforting boughs of the Jurian trees.  A grassy field,
ablaze with the smells of wildflowers and the heady scent of earth itself.  A
perfect place for a rendevous, and she was alone in it with Tenchi.

    But, she thought to herself with a smile, Tenchi in real life is even better
than in a dream.  She chuckled, recognizing the slow whistling snore that was
the bane of his sleep.  She turned over to watch him sleep, and to think
about... things.  A pair of golden feline eyes met her about halfway.

    "So was it good for you too, Princess?"

    Ayeka could do nothing but scream.

"In Defense of Sasami!"
