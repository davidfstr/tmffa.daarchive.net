You Took the Words Right Out Of My Mouth
(cool winter Night)

Disclaimer: the following song is based on "You took the words right out of my 
mouth (Hot summer nights)" By Meatloaf. I am not a sick person.. well maybe a 
little...*ahem* Neither Tenchi or the base for this song are my property (even 
the idea wasn't). The Meatloaf parts are sung by any of the male Tenchi cast and 
the female parts (hentai detected) are sung by Ryo Ohki just so ya know...

On a cool winter night.
Would you offer your coat to the cute with the black nose?
Will she offer me her miya?
Yes
Will she offer me her feet?
Yes
Wlll she offer me her paws?
Yes
Will she offer me her hunger?
Yes
Again. Will she offer me her hunger?
Yes
And will she starve without me?
Yes
And does she love me?
Yes
Yes
On a hot summer night.
Would you offer your carrot to the fluff with the brown fur?
Yes
I bet you say that to all the boys. 

It was a cool winter evening and the lake was frosting 
There was a fog crawling over the pond 
When I listen to your heart, I hear the whole world turning 
I see the carrots stems 
Falling through your trembling paws

You were licking your hips and your lips were shining 
I was dying just to ask for a taste 
We were lying together in a silver lining 
By the light of the moon 
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment 
Not another moment to waste

You hold me so close that my knees grow weak 
But my soul is flying high above the ground 
I'm trying to scream but no matter what I do 
I just can't seem to make any sound

And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh-it must have been while you were kicking me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
And I swear it's true 
I was just about to say I despise you 
And then you took the words right out of my mouth
Oh-it must have been while you were kicking me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
And I swear it's true 
I was just about to say I hate you

Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water 
And I guess that I'm beginning to grin 
Oooh, we're finally alone and we can do what we want to 
The night is young 
And ain't no one gonna care where you 
No one gonna care where you
No one's gonna care where you've been

You were licking your lips and your hips were shining 
I was dying just to ask for a taste 
We were lying together in a silver lining 
By the light of the moon 
You know there's not another moment
Not another moment 
Not another moment to waste

And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh-it must have been while you were killing me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
And I swear it's true 
I was just about to say I hate you 
And then you took the words right out of my mouth 
Oh-it must have been while you were killing me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
And I swear it's true 
I was just about to say I kill you

You took the words right out of my mouth 
It must have been while you were eating me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
It must have been while you were excreting me 
You took the words right out of my mouth 
It must have been while you were stomping me
