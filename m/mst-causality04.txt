Causality - MST #4 : "Ryoko's Love, Prologue Ch. 1-3"
Why MST a good fic?  Sometimes you just gotta look at the lighter side of
things.

and Richard Pini of WaRP graphics.)  The only things I claim for my own are
Newjersey Silverwolf and the work I did on the MST.
	On another note, I am anticipating flames from MSTing a reputably good fic. 
However, I must state that a healthy individual has the capacity to laugh at
oneself.  Also, judging by the results of the TMFFA voting booth, this is a
popular fic.  People who have read it ought to get the jabs and jokes.  The
vast majority of the hentai comments (pretty much all of them) are the result
of the MSTers' perceptions of the fic (sick minded little bastards) and do not
necessarily reflect the fic author's intended meaning.

Query> SHOULD WE SUBJECT THE MSTERS TO A GOOD FIC?
MAGI DELIBERATING........DONE.
MELCHIOR:	Affirmative.
BALTHAZAR:	Affirmative.
CASPER:	Affirmative.
RESULT: 3-0 FOR SUBJECTING THE MSTERS TO A GOOD FIC.

MISSION LOG #4: "RYOKO'S LOVE PROLOGUE"
NERV TOP SECRET
YOU NEVER SAW THIS, WE NEVER HAD THIS CONVERSATION, AND AS FAR AS YOU ARE
CONCERNED, YOU DO NOT EXIST.

BALTHAZAR:	NERV-MST Episode 3, reeeeeeeel one!

OPENING THEME v.0.1 (To the MST3K theme song)

In the not-distant-enough future,
Post Third-Impact A.D.,
The Event Horizon ripped a hole
Across causality.

A secret group by the name of NERV
Tried to find what purpose the hole could serve...
Well, the Fourth Impact left them alive,
So they had to seal the hole up before Impact number Five!

(OH...NOT AGAIN!!!)

RITSUKO:	<singing>
I'll test a group with fanfics!
The oddest I can find! (la la la)
They'll watch them while I monitor
Their sync ratios and minds! (la la la)

Now keep in mind the mission fails
If the world happens to end,
But the crew just doesn't know why NERV
Has to rearrange their friends...

Current Roll Call!
Shinji! ("I mustn't run away...")
Lina!	("DRAGON SLAVE!!!")
Cutter!	("AYOOOOAH!")
Celcia!	(Elder of the Elves!)
RYOOOOOOOOOOOOOKO!	(Space pirate!)

If you're wondering how they eat and breathe,
Well Ritsuko knows the facts.
But if you're looking for NERV's MST,
Then have a seat and just relax!

For NERV's latest conspiracy...Causality!

Door 1:	Entry plug images fade.
Door 2: Entry plug ejects, pull back from Eva-01.
Door 3: Cage closes as the two chain-link barriers slide together in
overlapping arrangement.
Door 4...

Query> SHOULD THE DOOR SEQUENCE BE INCLUDED IN THE MST?
MAGI DELIBERATING......DONE.
MELCHIOR:	Negative.
BALTHAZAR:	Negative.
CASPER:	Negative.
RESULT: 0-3.  PROPOSITION OVERRULED.

	The story opens in the synchronization test bed, where Shinji Ikari and
Asuka Langley Sorhyu are undergoing synchronization tests.  The test plugs are
set up with their ends pointed into the pool of LCL, as is usual for a synch
test, and Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi are in the control booth with
technicians Maya Ibuki, Shigeru Aoba, and Makato Hyuga.

RITSUKO:	Shinji, synchronization ratio 23%.  He's dropped off from his usual
46%.  Asuka's doing well, synchronization ratio 51%.

MISATO:	Well, she has had time to recover.  I'm not surprised about
Shinji...given what we've just put him through, he's taken a pretty brutal
assault.

MAYA:	Shinji's synch ratio's up by two points.

MISATO:	Um...Ritsuko?

RITSUKO:	Yes?

MISATO:	What do these synch numbers mean?

RITSUKO:	Hell if I know.  All I know it has to be above ten percent for
Eva activation, it can get really high at times, and at 400%, it turns the
pilot into LCL.

MAKATO:	Dr. Akagi, these readings just got a little wierd...

RITSUKO:	What?

MAKATO:	There's a lot of noise in the synchronization tank.  I can't figure it
out...

	Misato goes to the window.  Down in the pool of LCL are Cutter, swimming
nude in the LCL, Celcia, lying on a towel top of the empty entry plug, trying
to get a tan from the overhead lights, Lina Inverse, windsurfing across the
pool with a little help from...

LINA:	VORMEDALE WIND!

	...and Ryoko, on her back, floating over the pool with a glass in her hand
(which has an umbrella in it).

RYOKO:	<sigh> You know, this isn't such a bad place to vacation.  Makes for
interesting scenery.

CELCIA:	And lousy tanning.  Why couldn't we have gone to the beach?

LINA:	Hey, I don't want to be left behind when the causality hole finally
gets fixed.  And you know it's that water-ski competition in the Geofront lake. 
VORMEDALE WIND!  <gives herself a little speed>

	Ritsuko and Misato facefault.  Ritsuko activates the comm out into the
testbed.

RITSUKO:	Just what are you doing down there?

RYOKO:	Having a Pi–a Colada.  Want one?

RITSUKO:	Ryoko, we're trying to do synchronization tests!  We don't need
thought noise from everyone else polluting the readings!

CUTTER:	<sticking his head above the LCL> Hey, you brought us here, we just
want to go home.

MISATO:	Cutter...you're not naked, are you?

CUTTER:	Wolfriders are kinda rustic that way.

CELCIA:	CUTTER NO ECCHI!

CUTTER:	HEY!  It's a custom, all right?!

	Suddenly the lights go to red, a klaxon sounds, and the PA system blares.
	
PA:	First stage alert.  All personnel to first stage alert.

LINA:	Guess it's out of the pool, guys.

RYOKO:	Cutter, I hope you have a towel...

	After some time, the MSTers are assembled in the NERV briefing room.  All
are dressed in their plug suits.  Around the table:

Shinji Ikari (Angst-filled Eva pilot)
Ryoko (Genetically-engineered space pirate)
Lina Inverse (Beautiful genius sorceress...but NEVER mention her chest)
Cutter (Elfin chief of the Wolfriders)
Gendo Ikari (Shinji's Father, Commander of NERV)
Ritsuko Akagi (The doc of NERV)

RITSUKO:	Well that was a day shot.  We got zilch in the synchro test
readings because your presence made them all invalid.

MISATO:	Oh lay off, Ritsuko, it's not the first time we've had to deal with
thought noise.  Shinji was doing rather well despite that.

RYOKO:	So what's with the alert?  Why are we all here this time?  What's the
crisis?

GENDO:	There is no crisis.

	All turn to look at Gendo, who, as usual, has his hands propped up in front
of his face.

GENDO:	This will be another trial of the Entry Theater.  All of you are going
to take on a fic of great popularity.  This will be the first time we've done
something like this.

LINA:	Wait...wait a second.  Did I just hear that right?  You're going to
give us a popular fic?

GENDO:	Correct.

RITSUKO:	We will be operating on a fic which has scored #1 in the top ten
Tenchi Muyo fanfics on the Tenchi Muyo Fan Fiction archive.  It's largely
considered required reading by Aeka-Hating-Ryoko-Loving-Idiots.

	Ryoko visibly shudders.
	
SHINJI:	What?  Ryoko, I thought you'd like having a fan base.

RYOKO:	Fans and supporters of my relationship with Tenchi...I can appreciate
that.  But the AHRLI's?  Every time I think about them it feels like I'm beling
stalked by Kagato again.  They're unthinking!  They're rabid!  I don't need
them to fight my personal battle with Aeka for MY Tenchi!

MISATO:	Well...this fic isn't like the stuff we've subjected you to.  Some
people, intelligent people, actually consider the writing good.  However, we
must investigate.

CELCIA:	So who's riding the sixth seat?

RITSUKO:	Sixth seat?

CELCIA:	There are five of us.  We usually take six on an MST, and that little
incident with the progressive knife put Newjersey off the active roster.

CUTTER:	That is true...I'm missing a wolf-friend.

RITSUKO:	Well, fortunately, a preliminary analysis indicates you shouldn't
need a linguist this time.  As for the sixth seat, we are bringing in another
special guest.

LINA:	You know, given the fact that the causality hole is our problem, I
question the motives for bringing people through it and further scrambling this
reality.

	Enter a rather surly-looking half-demon, Inu-Yasha.  His hair is silvery,
flowing down behind his head.  Poking through his hair on the top of his head
are his doglike ears.  Around his neck is a string of rosary beads.  His
fingers terminate in pointed claws.  His eyes are yellow...pretty much
Inu-Yasha.  The only thing different about him is his garb.  He wears a salmon
plug suit.

INU-YASHA:	Would someone tell me exactly WHY I was yanked out of my own
dimension to this...this...

CUTTER:	Well, probably one of those random things.

INU-YASHA:	I was too close to having the Shikon Jewel in my grasp...just a few
more shards!

GENDO:	That's all well and good, Mr. Yasha...

INU-YASHA:	That's Inu-Yasha, old man.

GENDO:	Why don't you just sit down?

	At the word "Sit," the beads activate, and Inu-Yasha immediately
faceplants.  The room is silent for a moment.

MISATO:	I thought that only worked for Kagome...

INU-YASHA: <Recovering> How do you know Kagome?!

SHINJI:	I believe it's called "Manga."

INU-YASHA:	Just let me out of here, or you'll feel the carress of my claws!

RYOKO:	Just try it, dog-boy.

GENDO:	ENOUGH!  Ritsuko, are you sure this is a good move?

RITSUKO:	It's the best option we have.

GENDO:	Very well then.  All of you, into the theater.

	The 5 MSTers enter the Entry Theater.  The seating order is...Ryoko,
Inu-Yasha, Celcia, Shinji, Lina, Cutter.  Watching in the control block in
Central Dogma is Ritsuko, Misato, Maya, Shigeru, and Makato.

RITSUKO:	Filling the Entry Theater.

INU-YASHA:	<grumble> Feh.  Do they expect me to drown?

RITSUKO:	Power supply connected.  Commencing activation system.  Initiating
first stage connections.   Voltage climbing to border-line.  Initiating second
stage connections.  Theatre has activated.

MISATO:	LAUNCH!

>Tenchi Muyo: Ryoko's Love... 

CUTTER:	I smell a Lemon.  Oh High Ones, do I smell a Lemon.

RYOKO:	Cutter, the fic hasn't even started yet.

>Prologue Chapter 1:Introducing, Yui! 

SHINJI:	Mom?!

LINA:	Release version C.

>Disclaimer:
>The characters you are about read are characters created by AIC/Pioneer. 
>Don't sue me.

SHINJI:	<as AIC attorney> Well, we'll see just how good this fic really is, and
maybe we won't have to serve your ass a paper.

>Author's notes:
>

INU-YASHA:	Feh.

>This is the revised and hopefully corrected version of chapter one, you might 
>notice some added changes and different rearrangements.

CELCIA:	So what is this, the "King James Version" of "Ryoko's Love?"

>And for those who read the original draft of this chapter a few weeks or days

>

LINA:	In other words, they're still in beta testing.

>What you are about to read is a Tenchi FF set in the OVA universe, but it will 
>start 20 years in to the future.  As this series progresses the story will be 
>taken on the present day and it will also take place in other different

INU-YASHA:	Make up your mind!  Past, future, present?!  At least my story
follows a continuity with respect to characters!

>I won't be including Kiyone or Mayuka in this FF, sorry fans. I'm going to
>introduce new characters in this series, Yui, Onimaru and many others.  

CUTTER:	Should we be worried about Self-Insertions and other things?

>So, without further a do, let the series begin...

>------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>

RYOKO:	Oh no...that's the same kind of page break Tank Cop uses.  I have a
seriously bad feeling about this...

>April 24, 2018
>

SHINJI:	Eighteen years after Second Impact...

LINA:	<as Sarah Connor> The survivors of the nuclear holocaust named the war
against the machines "Judgement Day..."

>It was another typical day for the students at Okayama High School. Everybody
>sat in their desks, bored and struggling to stay awake while trying to take
>in Sensei's stale lecture about the Tokugawa Shogunate. One such student, Yui,

SHINJI:	Is that mom?

CUTTER:	Don't think so...your mom is a biomechanoid run on an S2 engine.

SHINJI:	I meant BEFORE that!

>sat in the second of four rows, a 17-year old girl full of life. Standing at
>5'7 with yellow yet human eyes, she was possessed of athletic prowess hidden
>within the frame of a perfect lady. Her long, soft, cyan hair

RYOKO:	Is that a resemblance I see before me?

CELCIA:	Uh, Ryoko, keep in mind the Anime laws of physics...hair can take any
color of the visible electromagnetic spectrum.

>was tied up in a
>beautiful ponytail. She stared blankly out the window, watching a beautiful
>day pass by, envying the birds flying around of their own free will. Lost in
>her thoughts and daydreams,

INU-YASHA:	Having the direction sense of Ryoga inside her own head...

LINA:	<as Yui> My train of thought has been derailed...and it's still going.

>she hated to waste beautiful days like this at
>school.
>
>*I wish I was out there. I bet it feels nice,* she thought. 
>
>"Miss Masaki! Will you please turn around and pay attention!" shouted Sensei.
>
>"Oh! Uh...Y-Yes, sir," she said, her face turning red. "Sorry."  
>

CELCIA:	Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't embarrassment usually signified by a
sweatdrop, and arousal signified by blushing?

CUTTER:	I don't think even the Anime laws are set in stone.

SHINJI:	If they are, I sense a disturbing relationship taking place in this
classroom.

RYOKO:	Wait a minute..."Miss Masaki," cyan hair, yellow eyes...is anyone else
drawing some conclusions here that are quite appealing?

INU-YASHA:	Washu had fun with Tenchi and a petri dish?

	Ryoko scorches Inu-Yasha with a plasma bolt.
	
INU-YASHA:	You really started making me angry.

>Sensei sighed. "Just like your father, it clearly runs in the family."
>
>Yui's classmates started laughing. 
>
>"Class! Quiet down!" Sensei shouted again.  The students immediately quieted 
>down.  The old educator calmed down a little. "Ok, now where were we? Ah 
>yes...the Tokugawa government later took control after the war..."     
>
>*I can't wait until school's over,* Yui thought to herself.
>
>Two hours later, school finally ended and Yui was at her locker trying to open 
>it. The door was jammed.  She had always had trouble opening her locker.
>Mainly because of one reason...

CUTTER:	...the bomb squad was once again responding to a threat.

LINA:	That was random.

>
>"Stupid locker!  I hate it when this happens!" she said, struggling with the 
>locker door.  She finally forced the locker to open, and a tidal wave of love/
>secret admirer letters, small gifts, 

INU-YASHA:	Burnt offerings...

SHINJI:	Letter bombs...

CUTTER:	Animal carcasses...

LINA:	Drug shipments...

>and even a few crushed

CELCIA:	...skulls...

>flowers came 
>pouring out.  Burying her knee-deep in to the pile.  Yui's best friend, Misato 

SHINJI:	MISATO?!

MISATO:	<in comm window> I don't think that's me, guys...

INU-YASHA:	You're right, she actually looks sober.

MISATO:	<ICW> HEY!

>Matsumiya, walked by and stopped in front of Yui. 
>
>"Looks like the love magnet has her hands full again," Misato joked.
>
>"Oh shut up, Misato!" Yui barked.
>

CUTTER:	<as Yui> Arf!  Arf!  Arf!

RYOKO:	SHADDUP, CUTTER!

>"What are you going to do with all that?  Read them or...the usual?"  said the 
>silky black-haired girl, with cheerful eyes and a warm smile.

LINA:	Her smile.  That explains global warming.

SHINJI:	The way Misato phrased that sets her up for a double entendre.

>
>"The usual." Yui growled at her predicament, picking up the letters, gifts,
>and flowers and throwing them in to a nearby trash can.  As the letters fell
>into the trashcan Yui could hear hearts being shattered; athletes, nerds, and
>even some senseis could be heard crying in the background.
>

SHINJI:	Wait!  I was just kidding about those disturbing relationships!

CUTTER:	Don't you just hate being right?

LINA:	First she's barking, then she's growling.  Was there a Ryoko/Newjersey
romance going on?

RYOKO:	That was your one free chance, Lina.  Next time, you die.

>"Don't you have any time for love, Yui?" Misato asked.
>
>"Nope.  Not interested right now." Yui began to make her way towards the
>main doors.  

INU-YASHA:	Masaki.  Not interested in love.   Yep, she's definitely Tenchi's
daughter.

RYOKO:	Oh you son of a...

CELCIA:	Ryoko, I've got a better idea.  SIT!

	Inu-Yasha slams facefirst into the theater floor.
	
RYOKO:	Really that simple, huh?

INU-YASHA:	I'll get you for that, you elven bitch.

>
>Misato watched Yui walking off, then looked down and noticed a letter on the
>floor that Yui dropped

LINA:	Yui dropped the floor?  Wow.  She can bench a lot!

SHINJI:	That strength...she IS my mom!

RYOKO:	Shinji, did that description sound like an Eva to you?  Don't jump to
conclusions!

>while putting the rest in the trash.  Picking it up, she 
>realized the letter belonged to the biggest jerk in the whole school:  the 
>Student Council president, Katsuhiko Jinnai.

CUTTER:	Okay, if we assume that this is a Tenchi-based fanfic, it's been
invaded by Evangelion, and now El-Hazard.

CELCIA:	Oh boy...the causality hole has affected the fic as well!

>Misato smiled deviously.
>

LINA:	<as Misato> MWAHAHAHAHA!!!  I'm going to be EEEEEEVIL!!!

>"I'm going to have fun with this letter!" Misato laughed, putting the letter 
>into her book bag.  
>
>After passing through the doors, 

INU-YASHA:	Figuratively or literally?

RYOKO:	Literally has my vote.  That would mean she gets it from my side of the
family.

>the next routine was the part that Yui hated 
>the most.  She had to try to make her way to the gate without making contact 
>with any of the guys.

CUTTER:	...You see, all of the males at this school had contracted the Ebola
virus.

LINA:	<as Yui> Eeeeeeww!  Cooties!

>Nevertheless, her hopes were usually in vain; a freckled 
>boy with lazy eyes, and bad green teeth, walked up to her.
>

SHINJI: <as Austin Powers> Smashing, Baby!

CELCIA:	That's kind of a reach, that description and Austin Powers.

SHINJI:	It was the bad teeth from the first movie.  Closest thing I could come
up with.

>"Uh... hello, Yui. Can I walk you home?"  he said, nervously.
>
>"No," she replied bluntly.
>
>The boy became shattered

RYOKO:	See, that's what happens when you get careless with liquid nitrogen.

>and turned pale; he stood as still as a statue as Yui 
>kept on walking.  She was halfway towards the gate when a handsome stud of a
>jock walked up to her. He had perfect gleaming teeth, nicely combed hair, and 
>a strong athletic build.

ALL THE GIRLS:	YOWZA!

>
>"Say pretty, you look tired," he said confidently.
>
>"Tired from what?" she asked, not looking at him.
>
>"Tired from running around in my mind all day." He smiled, and a sparkle
>shined across his perfect set of teeth.  
>

	All the girls facefault.
	
LINA:	He was cute until he said that.  That has got to be one of the lamest
pick-up lines on the planet.

>"Why don't you go away and bench-press yourself to death?" she said cruelly. 
>"That is the lamest pick up line I've ever heard!"
>

	Silence for a moment, then...

INU-YASHA:	Lina...shut up.

>"B-but...b-but..." The jock all of sudden looked very small.  He started to 
>grind his teeth.
>

CUTTER:	<as the jock> Be me alive or be me dead, I'll grind my teeth to make my
bread!

CELCIA:	Faerie tale references coming from an elf?  There is something
seriously wrong with that.

CUTTER:	Look who's talking.

>"Frogs make better sounding mating calls than that!" 
>

INU-YASHA:	<as frog> Bud...

RYOKO:	<ditto> ...weis...

SHINJI:	<ditto> ...er...

>"I...I..." The jock struggled with his words.  "BUT I LOVE YOU!!!"  he shouted 
>with tears streaming down his cheeks.  The jock ran off crying like a little 
>boy. 
>
>Yui sighed in exasperation. *Why must I go through with this EVERY single
>day?*

RYOKO:	It's the sex appeal factor from Tenchi.

LINA:	Tenchi?  Sex appeal?  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!

	Ryoko blasts Lina into the wall.

>Yui finally reached her bus stop.  She waited a few minutes and a bus stopped
>in front of her.  As the doors to the bus opened, she heard a low rumbling,

ALL:	EARTHQUAKE!!!

>turned around and saw a mob of all the boys in her school running, trying to
>catch her before she got on the bus.  All were shouting for her.  "YUI! WE
>LOVE YOU! WE WANT TO DATE WITH YOU!"

CELCIA:	<as Yui> I'm sorry, you want Akane Tendo.  She's at Furinkan High
School.

SHINJI:	Ye gads...it's the Kuno clones.

>
>"Oh no!  Don't they ever give up?" she shouted.
>
>Yui hurriedly stepped onto the bus, the driver perturbed to see the mob
>running towards it.
>
>"Jeez...Hurry up, get in!  Why must you put me through this every day?" the 
>driver said angrily.  Yui quickly took haven within the bus.

INU-YASHA:	Missing capital, fifteen yard penalty.

>
>"Floor it!!"  she shouted.  The driver quickly put the bus in gear and burned  
>rubber, speeding away from the school grounds. 

SHINJI:	Okay...I don't care what the author says.  A bus engine is built for
torque, not brake horsepower, and they are diesel-driven.  It takes a lot of
RPM's to burn rubber out of a dead stop, and I seriously doubt a bus engine is
built for that.

LINA:	Maybe Misato's driving.

SHINJI:	She's not THAT bad.

>The boys all simultaneously waved good bye.
>
>The bus rumbled along through the late afternoon, going towards the country-
>side, things finally calming down.  Yui looked out the window,  gazing at the 
>countryside.

RYOKO:	No really, you think?  She wouldn't be gazing at the Tokyo Skyline?

>Yui always wondered why her father didn't want to move out to the city;  

CUTTER:	Probably the smog, the crime, or the giant monster attacks.  Take your
pick.

>it could've been more convenient for her, not having to spend so much money on
>bus passes.  On the other hand, she started to think about the countryside's
>natural beauty throughout the seasons.  Serene orange-red autumn days, snowy
>winter wonderlands, hot green summer days, and of course, her favorite spring
>time cherry blossoms.

INU-YASHA:	Cherry blossoms equal nostalgia.

>
>*Oh well, the countryside was always beautiful year round.  It would be crazy
>to try to move somewhere else,* Yui sighed.

CUTTER:	*Was?*  What happened to it now?

>
>Yui began to think about today's special occasion. Aunt Sasami, Aeka

RYOKO:	<fuming> *Aunt* Sasami?!  That would mean Tenchi and Aeka...

LINA:	Ryoko, calm down!  Tenchi's already related to Aeka and Sasami by royal
blood, it could mean anything!

SHINJI:	Now who's jumping to conclusions?

>and Mihoshi are all coming back home to visit.
>
>It was always fun having them coming by and visit, 

CUTTER:	Mihoshi always makes a splashy entrance.

CELCIA:	<as Aeka> You crashed the Ryo-oh into the lake again!  Why do I EVER
let you drive?!

>especially Aunt Sasami.  Yui loved her aunt's cooking and even though Sasami
>was grown up, 

INU-YASHA:	Feh.  Figures.  That means the author can make a Sasami Lemon now
without worrying about statutory rape laws.

>Yui always had fun being around her.  Aunt Sasami always came by to visit at
>least 3 times a month, staying at her house for days at a time.

RYOKO:	Practically speaking, wouldn't that mean she stays at the Masaki
residence all the time?

>Her aunt always had a cheerful attitude

LINA:	<Sarcastically> No, really?  I always thought she was a cynical little
bitch!

>to keep things going; that was one of the reasons why Yui loved being around
>her. Sasami had another name she also went by 

SHINJI:	...because having been recently promoted to the ten most wanted by the
Galaxy Police, she had to keep an extensive list of aliases handy.  <Gets
blasted by Ryoko>

RYOKO:	Watch how you talk about Sasami-chan, Ikari.

>...Tsunami,

LINA:	Surf's up!

>but she preferred to be called Sasami by her friends and family.  Yui has
>always admired her aunt's tremendous beauty; after all, she was a goddess just
>like

CUTTER:	...Belldandy.

>Yui's grandmother Washu.  She looked so elegant with her long blue hair, pink
>colored eyes

RYOKO:	*Grandmother* Washu!  See?  There!  I've gotta be the mother!

INU-YASHA:	Blue hair, pink eyes.  This is the wierdest form of albinism I've
ever seen.

>that always emitted a delightful aura of joy, strong cheerful laugh with 
>healing power, and not to mention she also possessed the universe's most 
>powerful energy!

CELCIA:	Who got da juice?  She got da juice!

SHINJI:	<as Vader> The force is strong with this one...

>
>Aeka, however, was a different story.

RYOKO:	...she was the same bitch as always.

SHINJI:	Isn't that being kinda...AHRLI-ish?

RYOKO:	I have a right to say that, I have first-hand experience.

>Aeka didn't visit as much as Sasami, mainly because of

LINA:	...Noboyuki's restraining order.

>her duties as the Empress of Jurai.  Before her ascension to the throne 17
>years ago, her great-great grandparents Azusa, Funaho, and Lady Misaki decided
>to retire from the throne, leaving it empty to Yosho, Aeka, and her father. 

INU-YASHA:	Well, yes, that's how it usually happens.  The previous ruler has
to vacate the position of power before the new ruler can take it.

>Yosho obviously didn't want the throne because he still felt strongly attached

CELCIA:	<as Yosho> Damn super glue.

>he was very adamant about dying on Earth.  Although it would take thousands of
>years before he actually died...  
>
>*I guess he just doesn't want to get involved with the politics,* Yui thought
>to herself. 
>

CUTTER:	<as Yosho> I got sick to death with all the damn recounts.  Who'd have
thought Florida would care about Juraian politics?

>Her father was also considered to take the throne, but Azusa was very adamant 
>about keeping her father away from there.  The king of Jurai had a tremendous
>prejudice against her father, the reason being he was an earthling.

RYOKO:	That "earthling" could form Light Hawk Wings with sufficient power to
overwhelm a black hole!  You'd think Azusa would be proud of that!

SHINJI:	So? <Forming an AT field shaped like the Light Hawk Wings>

LINA:	Shinji...how...

SHINJI:	I'm sychronized with an Eva, remember?  It's just careful manipulation
of the Eva's AT field.

ASUKA:	<in comm window> Shinji, you little show-off!  How come you have to
best me at *everything?!*

>What pissed her off the most was the way Azusa always looked down at him, as
>if he were some lowlife commoner.  Yui always hated being around Azusa; to
>her, he was always pouting about something. 

RYOKO:	Well, he *is!*
 
>
>*As if my father actually cared about taking the stupid throne in the first 
>place!* she thought angrily. *At that time, mother was pregnant with me!*
>

CUTTER:	But wouldn't that be incentive for taking the throne?  I mean you'd
think the Emperor of Jurai would get some medical benefits, including prenatal
care.

RYOKO:	Eh, I've looked into it.  The dental plan's okay, but the medical plan
sucks.  Piracy has much better benfits.

CELCIA:	I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  I can't believe the space
pirates have unionized.

>Naturally, Aunt Aeka

RYOKO:	There!  *Aunt* Aeka!  Hah!  She couldn't be Yui's mother!

INU-YASHA:	Ryoko, you're assuming that just because her last name is Masaki,
that Tenchi was the father.

RYOKO:	Just *what* are you implying?

INU-YASHA:	Noboyuki with Sakuya or Kiyone.

RYOKO:	<charging up an energy bolt> Why I... <thinks better of it> SIT!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants into the theater floor.
	
RYOKO:	Celcia, you're right, this is much easier.

LINA:	He does have a point.  We haven't had much disambiguity as to Yui's
parentage other than her surname.  All we've done is narrow it down.  Also keep
in mind that based on the inherited traits of this child, there's still one
more mildly disturbing possibility.

RYOKO:	<coldly> And that is?

LINA:	Noboyuki and adult Ryo-Ohki.

	Silence for a second, then all of the MSTers vomit into the LCL.
	
LINA:	Oh Cephied, someone hit me before I say something like that...

>became the new ruler of the Jurai Empire.  When Aeka's 
>husband temporarily stepped in to rule the empire, Aeka would come by to visit 
>about once every 3 months, staying at the house for 2 or 3 days before she had
>to return home to perform her duties.

SHINJI:	Even with hyperspace transport, that's gotta be a helluva commute!

>During those 3 days, Aeka would always 
>teach Yui about the importance of being her own individual, maintaining
>respect, and teaching responsibility.

CELCIA:	<as Aeka> You see, Yui, if you have two big logs, you can always get
your way.

>To Yui, Aeka was the perfect example of being a lady.

RYOKO:	That bitch!  Corrupting the poor girl...

>Aeka was  always elegant in every aspect; although Aeka was the Empress of
>Jurai, she also knew how to have fun.

LINA:	<as Aeka> Yes, glomping Tenchi and arguing with Ryoko.  What could be
more fun?

>Every time Aeka came by to visit, she would always challenge her to a

CUTTER:	...drinking contest...

RYOKO:	No way, elf-boy.  Aeka can put away sake like nobody's business.

>singing contest on the karaoke machine.  She was good at singing and always
>told Yui that she was a lot like her mother.  
>

INU-YASHA:	Does that mean that Aeka chewed Yui out, too?

>"You have a good singing voice, Yui!" her aunt always said.  "Always remember 
>that this is one of your talents and you have to keep refining your talents in 
>order to insure a full and joyous life."  

SHINJI:	Since when did Aeka become Yosho?

>
>Mihoshi was also expected to visit, but Yui doubted that Mihoshi would be able 
>to, considering the fact that she

CELCIA:	...was a bumbling idiot with the direction sense of Ryoga...

RYOKO:	That's a little unfair.  Mihoshi always seems to find the lake well
enough.

>was always busy at the Galaxy Police 
>Headquarters with her new job as Deputy Commander.

CUTTER:	That's like putting Wile E. Coyote in charge of a Roadrunner hunting
party, isn't it?

>Mihoshi was like a big 
>sister to Yui, even though she was a little airheaded.

LINA:	Understatement #1.

>Mihoshi was always there 
>for Yui, especially during her times going through that certain phase called 
>puberty.

CELCIA:	<as Mihoshi> Um...uh...well...when you get to that...certain special
age, you see...uh...I can't explain it!  WAAAAAAAAAHHHH!

>Her father was at a loss when it came to 'female' growth and 
>development;

INU-YASHA:	...so he took a trip to Jusenkyo.

SHINJI:	<as Jusenkyo guide> Oh, too bad, you fall in "Spring of Drowned Girl." 
That one very popular lately.

>when Sasami or Aeka weren't around, Mihoshi would be the one to 
>take care of her,  making sure that Yui would come out a perfect young lady.
>
>When neither Aeka, Mihoshi, or Sasami were around,  her grandmother Washu took 

INU-YASHA:	...her virginity.

RYOKO:	SIT!  SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT!!!

	Inu-Yasha hits the Entry Theater floor once for each "sit."

>care of her.  In all of Yui's life, Washu had been protecting her since she 
>turned the tender age of 4.  Since Yui's mother died, her mother's mother 
>was the perfect choice.  It was somewhat strange that her grandmother insisted 
>that she be called little Washu...

CUTTER:	She's twelve!  Why shouldn't she be called "little?"

>but Yui didn't mind having a grandmother 
>who looked a lot younger than her.  She loved Washu dearly and that was that.
>

RYOKO:	The next Hentai comment I hear will be met very painfully.

	Cutter and Shinji close their mouths.  Inu-Yasha is still trying to peel
himself off the theater floor.

>Whenever Yui asked a question, Washu was always straightforward with an
>answer.

LINA:	Usually that answer took several hours to complete.

CELCIA:	<as Yui> Gramma, where do babies come from?

RYOKO:	<as Washu> Well, dear, when a man loves a woman very very much, his
autonomic nervous system will activate on the parasympathetic side.  This
diverts blood flow to the penis, and also the nose in the case of Anime males. 
The woman has a similar reaction, though blood flow is instead diverted to the
labia, and in the case of Anime females, the face.  Meanwhile the male...

CELCIA:	<as Yui> Never mind, forget I asked.

>She never avoided a question.  Washu always said that Yui was very much like
>Ryoko, full of spirit and always 

INU-YASHA:	...perpetually horny for Tenchi.

RYOKO:	SIT!  <Inu-Yasha faceplants yet again.>  They never learn, do they?

CELCIA:	It's been getting worse since the last MST.

>strong willed.  The only questions that Washu didn't answer concerned how her
>mother died...

RYOKO:	<shocked> I'm...WHAT?!

LINA:	Now, now, Ryoko, there's still a lot that's up in the air.  I mean she
could still be the daughter of Noboyuki and...

RYOKO:	<Blasting Lina> SHUT UP, INVERSE!

>and that bothered her.  Every time Yui asked,  Washu simply replied by telling
>her

CUTTER:	...to shut the hell up before she busted out her subspace computer and
turned her into a newt!

>that her father would answer that question in due time;  what was even more
>disturbing was the fact that she couldn't recall any memories from her
>childhood, missing memories from ages 4 to 5.  She only remembered bits and
>pieces.  
>
>Yui looked at her watch. *It won't be another 10 minutes until I reach home.*
>She closed her eyes,  relaxing her mind and trying to regain one of her early 
>childhood memories.

>In her mind, it was pitch black,

CELCIA:	Eh, that movie was okay.

>but the only thing that kept it from being 
>lonely were voices and sounds from her early past.  Gradually, the pitch 
>darkness lifted away and she found herself in the fields of the countryside

CUTTER:	Oh High Ones, I think I need an insulin injection.

>Behind her a woman stood,  wearing a pink dress that only a mother could wear,

>
>"What do you think it is, Yui?" asked the soothing voice of her mother, Ryoko. 
>

RYOKO:	HAH!  I knew it!

INU-YASHA:	Well, that could still mean...

RYOKO:	SIT! <Inu-Yasha faceplants.>  No way in HELL would I marry Noboyuki!

>"Mm...Bu-fly?"
>

SHINJI: <as Yui> The Vampire Slayer?

>"That's right Yui!  But it's called, But-ter-fly."  She kneeled down next to 
>Yui,  
>holding her child close to herself and pointing things out.
>
>"But-ter-fly?"
>
>"Yes, butterfly,"  Ryoko said warmly. "Just like you, a butterfly.  Always 
>beautiful and always flying."
>

LINA:	*Always* flying?  Must have been a challenge to change that baby's
diaper...

CUTTER:	Lina, PLEASE!  Parenthood aside, I'm still having flashbacks from "My
Little Baby Cabbit!"

INU-YASHA:	Come on, Ryoko can fly too.  I'm sure she could handle her daughter
in mid-air.

CELCIA:	<as Ryoko> look out below!

>"Oh, Mommy!"  Yui blushed and giggled, hugging her kneeling mother. 
>
>"Mommy will always be with you."  She hugged Yui and laughed a healthy laugh.

>Then the memory faded away and Yui found herself back on the bus. Wish you

>                                                ***

CELCIA:	Fly specks.  They have been aiming.

>
>The bus finally reached Yui's stop. She left with a mute expression on her 
>face, hating the commute between home and school.  
>

SHINJI:	A *mute* expression on her face?  I think the author's mixing sensory
symbols.

>*The commute always takes too damn long!* she thought to herself, making her
>way up through the hill.  
>
>After a minute or so of walking, a thought struck her; she realized that 
>tomorrow would mark the 13th year since her mother's death.  She decided to

LINA:	In recovering her childhood memory, Yui forgot about pronouns.

>Ryoko Masaki

RYOKO:	<shedding a tear> Oh...this is so sad...I'm dead and there's my
daughter...oh Tenchi, I'm sorry I couldn't stay...<glomps Inu-Yasha, crying her
eyes out>

INU-YASHA:	GAH!  Ryoko!  Get off me!

LINA:	<as Ryoko> Go in peace and sin some more.

RYOKO:	<blasting Cutter and Lina> SHUT UP!  This is a solemn moment!

>you left, Mother.  I hope you like the flowers I 
>picked for you.  These flowers were our favorite,*  she thought to herself. 
>She wiped a tear from her eye and headed back home.  
>
>She went through the doorway and took off her shoes.
>
>"I'm home!" she called out.  The house was quiet. 
>
>"Miya!" Ryo-ohki cried out running down the stairs.
>

CELCIA:	Translation: "Carrots!  Gimme carrots!  I gotta have my fix!"

>"Hello, Ryo-ohki!" Yui said joyfully,  letting Ryo-ohki jump on to her
>shoulder to nestle her cheek.  Yui smiled. "And how are you doing today?"
>
>"Miya! Miya!" the cabbit answered back.
>

CELCIA:	Translation: "I gotta have my carrots!  I killed Tenchi because he
wasn't picking carrots fast enough!  Gimme my carrots now, biatch!"

RYOKO:	You know, I miss Newjersey.  Celcia, your translations suck.

>Ryo-ohki was usually a cabbit half the time; the other half she would spend in
>humanoid form. As a humanoid Ryo-ohki would help Yui with chores around the 
>house; being helpful was in Ryo-ohki's nature, not to mention her overactive

SHINJI:	...carrot eating binges.

>playfulness. Ryo-ohki and Yui were the perfect pair when it came to playing
>games. Usually they played 'chase the cabbit', where Yui and Ryo-ohki would 
>play a game of tag with Ryo-ohki in cabbit form. Whenever the cabbit was in
>humanoid form, they would dance, play video games, or dress up. Every so
>often, though, Yui would get the opportunity to pilot Ryo-ohki the spaceship.

RYOKO: <sigh> She would have inherited her.  Take good care of my daughter,
Ryo-ohki.

INU-YASHA:	Feh...

>The fact that Washu insisted on watching her every time she did this was a
>pain, but a minor one at that.

CUTTER:	That must have been an interesting way to get her license.

LINA:	<as Washu> Okay, Yui, now apply gentle pressure to the accelerator and
gently let off the clutch...

	Cutter imitates a squeal of tires, Shinji imitates a car crashing, and
Celcia imitates the cabbit's "Miya!"

LINA:	<as a rather injured Washu> Very good, Yui, but you should have put
Ryo-Ohki in first gear, rather than reverse.

>Yui could remember the first time she took Ryo-ohki out

SHINJI:	*BLAM!* *BLAM!*

>for a spin like it was just yesterday, and Washu's compliments about how well
>she could handle the starship.
>
>"I wonder what time it is?"  Yui looked over to the wall clock. It read 
>4:30pm. 
>
>*That's odd.  Where is everybody?  Shouldn't they be here by now?*
>
>"Oh Yui!" a voice shouted out from the kitchen. It was her grandfather
>Nobuyuki.
>
>"Yes grandfather?" She walked into the kitchen to find him cooking up some 
>food.  Nobuyuki had already developed a set of gray hair, but still had that 
>thin mustache.  She loved being around her adorable grandfather - even though
>he was a little nosy at times.

LINA:	Understatement #2.

>Her father, Tenchi, told her that he was much worse 
>when he was young,

LINA:	Understatement #3.

>always getting a camera at a moment's notice hoping to catch her father in
>some sexual situation.  Fortunately for Yui, Nobuyuki had toned down a lot.

RYOKO:	A castration with a light sword can do wonders that way.

>
>"Ah Yui!  How's my favorite granddaughter doing today?" he said cheerfully.
>
>"I'm doing fine grandpa." Yui stepped towards the fridge and opened the door,
>retrieving a bowl of carrots for Ryo-ohki.
>
>"And how's school?" he asked.  Yui sat down on a stool at the counter,  
>watching Nobuyuki cook.

SHINJI:	Noboyuki can cook?

CUTTER:	<as Yui> Well, I looted the chemistry stockroom for Ultra-Energy
Matter, I conquered the administrative offices, and anyone who got in my way
felt the sting of my energy blade.

>
>"Oh the usual, straight A's and all.

CELCIA:	This has the hopelessly idealistic stereotype structure of a
self-insertion fic. 

>Where's Washu?"  Yui asked, looking 
>around.
>
>"Oh she's in the lab, doing her usual research," Nobuyuki replied.
>

INU-YASHA:	Ten to one she's been playing EverQuest.

>"Oh. I see...," Yui said. Throughout most of Yui's life, whenever Washu wasn't 
>taking care of her, she would spend most of the daytime in her laboratory. 
>Yui had never stepped foot in to that dimensional lab, mainly because Washu
>forbid it.

SHINJI:	Narrative edited by Shampoo.

>Once in a while, Yui would try to break in to the lab herself but instead 
>of finding the dimensional lab, she would open the door under the stairs and 
>find a closet instead.

LINA:	So Yui was just waiting for Washu to come out of the closet?  <Gets
blasted by Ryoko>

>Just what was it that Washu was hiding from her?

INU-YASHA:	Her erotic torture chamber, maybe? <Gets blasted by Ryoko>

>
>"Miya! Miya!" Ryo-ohki jumped off her shoulders and onto the counter to eat
>the carrots.
>
>"So...you talked to any boys lately?"  Nobuyuki asked deviously.  "Your father 
>tells me that you get thousands and thousands of secret admirer letters 
>everyday."
>
>"Oh grandpa!" She said embarrassingly. 
>
>"Oh what's there to be shy about?  All I want to know is how well my 
>granddaughter is doing in her sexu --- uh, life development."

RYOKO:	Nice save, Noboyuki, but I know what you meant.  You are marked for
death.

CUTTER:	Ryoko, you're already dead.

RYOKO:	<bursting into tears again> don't remind me!

>
>Yui pretended to not hear Nobuyuki's last remark. "Well, you know how they 
>are these days."

INU-YASHA:	<as Noboyuki> Indeed I do, nudge nudge, wink wink.

>
>"No, how are they?"
>
>"You know...immature and always wanting some weird commitment.  

CELCIA:	Oh yeah, there's always something wrong with a man who wants a
commitment.

>The main reason why they want to know me is that they want to get laid."

LINA:	<as Yui> If I hear one more "chicken" joke, I'm going to slay the whole
student body with a lightsword!

>
>"Oh, I see.  That's understandable," he said, cutting up some vegetables then 
>putting them in a frying pan.
> 
>"So, grandpa..." began Yui, deciding to change the subject.
>
>"Yes, Yui?"  he asked.
>
>"How was your day at the office?"
>
>"Oh, you know.  Those young architects I just hired were really talented; I'm 
>having a hard time trying to decide which one of their blueprints to approve
>for the contractors."

RYOKO:	<as Noboyuki> Keiichi knows his engineering exceptionally well, but
Skuld is godlike in her design capacity, if I could only understand those
divine symbols she uses...

>
>"Oh really?"
>
>"Yeah... and I had to fire an employee today, as well."
>
>"Oh really?  Did you finally fire that lazy bum you were talking about for the 
>past 2 weeks?"
>
>"Yeah, I finally fired that idiot, Kaji. He was really wasting my company's
>time," he said with satisfaction.  "That'll teach him a lesson about eating up
>the Masaki Firm's finances!"

SHINJI:	So Kaji went on to eat up NERV's time and money instead.

INU-YASHA:	Has it ever occoured to you that maybe the author's just drawing
too many names from Neon Genesis Evangelion?

>
>"Isn't it great to be your own boss?" she said with a smile.

RYOKO:	Yep, that's one of the great perks of piracy...

>
>"Yes indeed!" he exclaimed, while stir-frying some noodles in the frying pan.
>
>Yui looked around and frowns a little.
>
>"Have my aunts arrived yet?" she asked.
>
>"Oh!  Forgive me!" he said loudly,

LINA:	<as Noboyuki> I thought you said "ants" and called the exterminator!

	The rest of the MSTers groan.

>"I've been meaning to tell you."
>
>"Tell me what?"
>
>"They won't be coming until tomorrow, Saturday."
>
>"What? Why?" She was clearly disappointed.
>
>"A formal meeting came up on the planet Jurai and it required presence of both 
>Aeka and Sasami."
>
>"Gee, I hope it's nothing like a crisis or anything serious."
> 
>"Nah, it's just one of those budget meetings."  He said, adding some soy sauce 
>to the noodles.

CELCIA:	Given the Juraian life span, that could mean they'll be in that meeting
for a couple of centuries or so.

>
>"Oh, well that's good." Yui was relieved. 
>
>Then her great grandfather Yosho walked in to the kitchen.  Throughout Yui's 
>life Yosho always looked old - but oddly enough hadn't aged a bit either,
>having the same appearance for most of her (relatively short) life.
>
>"I see that you've arrived home, Yui."  He sat down at the table across from 
>her.  "How's your day?"
>
>"Just another fine and beautiful day wasted at school,"  Yui replied,  getting 
>up to fetch the teapot for Yosho. 
>
>"I see...very interesting." Yosho smiled. "Don't worry, Yui.  You'll be
>spending the rest of what's left of daylight outside." 
>
>"What do you mean by that, grandpa Yosho?"  She asked, getting a teacup from a 
>cabinet.

SHINJI:	<as Yosho> Well, you see, all of the deficit spending we did over the
years to fix this house when your mother and aunt were fighting finally caught
up with us.  The bank is reposessing our house and the shrine.  We are
homeless.

>
>"Your father has graciously asked me to call for you."  He watched Yui set the 
>teapot and teacup in front of him.

CUTTER:	<as Yosho> I'm even supposed to use 1-800-COLLECT and save you up to
44%.

>
>"Call for me?" she said quizzically. "Call for me for what?" She poured a cup
>of tea for Yosho.
>
>"For practice.  He decided that he wanted to practice with you." Yosho sipped
>his tea.
>
>"What?! Now?!"  Yui asked and Yosho nodded.  "But I'm so beat!"

INU-YASHA:	<as a redneck Yosho> Not as beat as you'll be if you don't get your
little bee-hind to the training ground pronto, missy!  Now git!

>
>"He's waiting for you at the training ground.  He's expecting you over there
>by 5 o'clock."
>
>"What?!  That only gives me 10 minutes to get ready and run up there!"

LINA:	<as Yui> I can do math!

>"Then I guess you'd better go."  he said, sipping his tea.
>
>"Great! I hate it when he does things like this!"  Yui stormed out of the 
>kitchen at lightning speed to her room upstairs.
>
>Nobuyuki watched in amazement at how swiftly Yui flew out of the kitchen.  
>He walked over to the table where Yosho was sitting and served him a plate of 
>noodles.
>
>"Goodness!  She's fast!  I can barely see her run!"  Nobuyuki said in awe.  
>
>"Indeed."  Yosho picked up his chopsticks and set the plate of noodles in

RYOKO:	So in other words, not very long in the scope of the Juraian lifespan.

SHINJI:	I bet he's still making bank on his own series, though.

ALL:	That's debatable!

RYOKO:	HAH!  Is that unambiguous enough for you?  I'm her mom, Tenchi's her

SHINJI:	No!  Not THE SMILE!  Anything but THE SMILE!

CUTTER:	Most parents I know of give THE GLARE...maybe Juraians have a new

>*How does he do that?*  Yui found herself completely depleted of anger.

>"As much as I want to, Yui. I couldn't," he said. "But this is the only way I 
>can train you to expect the unexpected."

CELCIA:	Why doesn't he have Mihoshi crash into the lake at random intervals?

RYOKO:	With her track record, she can be expected to do that nowadays.

>Admiring his daughter's honesty, it 
>reminded him of all his time spent with Ryoko nearly 14 years ago.  Yui acted 
>so much like her mother that it was one of the driving forces that kept him 
>alive and happy.

LINA:	His pulse, respiration, and brain activity might have had something to
do with that too, but...nah.

>
>"Yes, I know,"  she said, beginning to smile.
>
>"Besides, the bright side to this is the fact that you don't have to do any 
>chores today!"  Tenchi put his hand on her shoulder.
>

INU-YASHA:	Cutter, can I have some of that insulin?

>"I guess."  Even though I'll do them later on, anyways, she thought to 
>herself.
>
>"Shall we begin our practice?"
>
>"Hai!" she said.  
>
>"Ok, then.  We'll start with a normal exercise and after that we'll spar. 
>We're just having a short practice today."
>
>"Ok.  Which exercise are we going to do?"
>
>"I'm going to test your speed and reflexes.  I'll test them by throwing this 
>pebble at you."  He held up a small pebble. "This is how your grandfather
>Yosho taught me how to keen my senses and reflexes."

RYOKO:	Let me get this straight.  Yosho taught Tenchi martial arts by throwing
rocks at him?

>
>"Ok.  How are we going to begin?"  she asked.

SHINJI:	<as Tenchi> Weren't you listening, Yui?  I'm going to throw rocks at
you!  That's how we're going to begin!

>
>"We'll try it stationary, then we'll go on from there.  I want to see how much 
>you've learned so far."
>
>As far as Yui could remember, she had been practicing sword fighting for most
>of her life since she was 6.  As she practiced with her father throughout her 
>life, she gradually discovered her hidden abilities,  abilities that most
>normal humans would never be able to do:

	Lina gets out a clipboard.
	
LINA:	Okay, let's go down the list...

>being able to levitate herself from one foot to 20 feet off the ground;

RYOKO:	Check.

>moving at speeds faster than a sprinting cheetah;

SHINJI:	Check.

>literally flying; being three times stronger than the world's strongest
>weightlifter;

CELCIA:	That's debatable.  I don't think I've seen her bench press a bulldozer.

>and quick reflexes that rivaled that of a cat. Most of her abilities were
>inherited from her mother.
>

INU-YASHA:	No, really, ya think?

>Yui placed herself in her Jurian battle-ready stance.
>

SHINJI:	...totally naked, on her back, legs spread apart...<gets blasted by
Ryoko>

>"Ok...ready?" Tenchi asked.  Holding up the pebble, he prepared to throw it at 
>her.
>
>She nodded yes.
>
>"Here it comes!" he yelled, immediately throwing the pebble.  The rock sped
>its way towards Yui, who deflected it easily.
>
>"How's that?" she said confidently.
>
>"Very good," he said.

CUTTER:	<as Tenchi> Considering I gave you plenty of advance warning.

>  "Not bad for your first time, but can you handle 3?"
>
>He suddenly threw 3 more rocks at her, each successfully deflected off Yui's 
>bokken.
>

INU-YASHA:	A quick hint, Tenchi, maybe if you throw the rocks at places other
than the bokken, she might become more skillful.

>"Excellent, Yui!  Now let's move it up one level."
>

SHINJI:	<as Emeril> Kick it up a notch!

>"Alright." She began to float 5 feet off the ground, grasping her bokken 
>in both hands.
>
>"Ok, now start flying around me, and at the same time try to deflect these
>rocks as they come to you."
>
>She began to fly around him in a wide circle, exceeding speeds of 25 MPH.

	Cutter starts making a siren sound.
	
LINA:	<as Mihoshi> Okay, pull over, Yui, let's see your license!

>
>"Ok, I'm ready!" she said in mid-flight.
>
>"Here they come!" He threw 2 rocks at her, each successfully deflected.

CUTTER:	<as Scotty> The shields are too powerful, cap'n!

>
>Yui smiled, obviously pleased with her progress.
>
>"Don't think I'm done yet, Yui." Tenchi grinned and instantly threw a volley 
>of rocks at her.  
>
>Yui saw the barrage of rocks flying at her, noting that it resembled a swarm
>of bees. *WHOA! DAMN!*

CELCIA:	Wow...she has Ryoko's powers, but she's allergic to beestings.

>She quickly dodged a good number of rocks and proceeded
>to deflect the rest.  As soon as she'd batted away the last rock, a second
>barrage came flying at her.  Focusing her attention on each rock, she started
>to swing her bokken, knocking the rocks away. She was becoming pleased with
>her abilities.  She felt a surge of adrenaline coursing through her body.
>These were the feelings she lived for, the rush and the exhilaration!

RYOKO:	Having your dad throw rocks at you is fun!

>
>Tenchi was amazed to see his daughter doing very well.  He got many feelings
>of satisfaction, watching the way she skillfully deflected his barrage of
>rocks.  Watching her bokken cut through the air, swiftly and surely,  he
>realized that he was running out of pebbles to throw at her, so he decided to
>do the next best thing.

INU-YASHA:	...he pulled out his Glock and opened fire.

LINA:	<as Tenchi as Trinity> Dodge this.

>Without warning, he charged at her with his bokken, ready to do battle.

SHINJI:	<as Yui> Dad!  Save that for mom!

	Celcia whacks Shinji with a rolled-up newspaper.
	
CELCIA:	Shinji!  You just have to get worse, don't you?

RYOKO:	I'm dead in this fic, remember?  By that double entendre, you just made
Tenchi into a NECROPHELIAC!

	Shinji vomits into the LCL.
	
SHINJI:	I'm with you, Lina...someone hit me *before* I say something like
that...

>
>As soon as she'd stopped the last rock from the last wave, Yui realized that
>the barrage had stopped and quickly spotted her father running straight
>towards her.  She immediately blocked his bokken before it could even touch
>her.  They were bokken-to-bokken to each other, struggling at each other's
>strength and trying to maintain their balance.

RYOKO:	...which was rather odd, considering that Yui was flying at the time
and not balancing *on* anything.

>
>"So dad, I see that you have ran out of rocks to throw at me," Yui said with a 
>grin.

CUTTER:	<as Yui> I read the narrative.

LINA:	Yui, would you choose a tense?  Subjunctive or past tense, but pick one
and stick with it!

>She jumped back away from him and went on the defensive.
>
>"Not really... I was tired of watching you play with rocks, so I decided to go 
>straight

INU-YASHA:	That implies Tenchi was gay befo...<gets blasted by Ryoko>...you
know, that is really doing nothing more than irritating me.

RYOKO:	Oh.  Forgot.  SIT!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants again.
	
RYOKO:	Ironic.  He's more powerful than Newjersey, but he's much easier to
subdue.

>to the spar,"  Tenchi said.  He lunged at her and she blocked him with her
>bokken.
>
>*She's very quick.  If she keeps this up, she'll be able to beat me and
>possibly even grandpa,* Tenchi thought to himself.  Tenchi was finding it
>harder to break through her defenses;  she was quick enough that he had to try
>to find a way to outsmart her.

CELCIA:	If she inherited her mother's intellect, that shouldn't be too hard.

RYOKO:	<Blasts Celcia> Bitch.

>
>Yui was pleased by her ability to block her father's attacks, but he was still 
>quite strong and just as fast as she was.  She tried not to think ahead of 
>herself.
>

SHINJI:	<as Yoda> Always your mind on where you are!  What you are doing!

>"You're becoming more and more like your mother, Yui.  Strong and quick,"  
>said Tenchi as he threw blows and swings at Yui.  Although Tenchi had never 
>really practiced sword fighting with Ryoko, there was that one time... 

CUTTER:	...and that one time resulted in Yui.

RYOKO:	Ooooh...clever.

>
>"Thanks, it runs in the family," she replied,  blocking and deflecting her 
>father's attacks.
>
>She found herself bokken-to-bokken again with her father.  Trying to maintain 
>her stand against her father's strength, she was surprised at how strong her 
>father was.  He's pretty strong for a man of his frame, she thought.

SHINJI:	<as Yoda> Size matters not.

CELCIA:	Says you.  <Snicker>  Little human.

SHINJI:	SHADDUP, CELCIA!  How would you know?!

	Celcia is strangely silent.

CUTTER:	Celcia, you haven't... 

CELCIA:	Well how many elves are there at NERV?  I didn't mean to see Shinji...

CUTTER:	CELCIA NO HENTAI!  I'm a mated elf!

LINA:	Wow, he picked up that phrase fast.

>
>Tenchi was feeling the same way about his daughter.  She was definitely
>strong, he thought, barely able to hold up against her.  If she were as strong
>as her mother, his bokken would have splintered by now.
>
>Through the rush of the sparring, Yui was struggling against her father's 
>bokken,

RYOKO:	Not ONE more double entendre about the bokken, Ikari.

	Shinji shuts up.

>then she suddenly felt a surge of energy coursing through her body, pulsating
>up into her left arm. This was something new, a sensation that she had never
>felt before.

INU-YASHA:	Wow, when Juraians go through puberty, they don't mess around!

>She felt the energy coursing through the veins of her left arm, gradually
>focusing on to one point, her palm, despite the fact she still held a tight
>grip on her bokken.
>
>"Uhh...Dad! Something's happening to my left arm!" she said nervously to her 
>father, pulling away from him to end the spar.
>
>"What?" Tenchi noticed his daughter's sudden withdrawal and stepped back.
>"What's wrong, Yui?"

CELCIA:	<as Yui> I haven't had coffee in four minutes and...

RYOKO:	Wrong kind of withdrawal, Celcia.

>
>"I don't know," Yui replied.  She dropped her bokken and looked at her left
>palm to the point where the energy was concentrating.  With no warning, an  
>energy ball materialized on her left palm.  Yui was awestruck.  "Dad, what's 
>going on?  What is this thing doing on my palm!?"

SHINJI:	<as Yui> This is the wierdest zit I've ever seen!

>
>"I'm not sure."  He came in for a closer look. "Yui, don't do a thing.  Let me 
>see what it is..."  
>
>He held up her left arm and gazed at the wad

INU-YASHA:	<pukes> Ugh...maybe Shinji was right about the "bokken..."

REST OF CAST:	SIT!!!!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants hard enough to put a dent in the theater floor.

>of energy.  He carefully examined
>the ball; then with a pop, it disappeared.
>
>"What do you think it was, dad?" asked Yui.
>
>"I'm not sure but I do have an idea," he said, thinking hard. That energy ball 
>resembled an energy discharge, he thought.  Is Yui finally regaining her
>powers?

CUTTER:	Well that would be rather odd, considering she didn't have that one to
lose yet.

>
>"Dad? What are you thinking about?" Yui asked again. 
>

RYOKO:	<as Tenchi> Wild, passionate sex with Ryok...

REST OF CAST:	We get the idea!

>"Yui, could you by any chance try to recreate that energy ball?" Tenchi asked.
>
>"I'm not sure, but I'll try," Yui said.  Then with so much as a tiny thought,
>the energy ball rematerialized. That time it came as a nervous impulse. 
>

CELCIA:	Uh oh...if she can set off her powers with nervous impulses, she's
kinda dangerous to be around when she's nervous.

LINA:	<as Yui as Mihoshi> Oops!  I thought the safety was on!

>Tenchi looked at the energy ball again and smiled.
>
>"Ah!  Looks like Yui finally developed her very own energy discharge!"  rang
>the voice of Washu, who was walking towards Tenchi and Yui.  Ryo-ohki followed
>Washu as well in her humanoid form.  Ryo-ohki was carrying a tray holding cups
>and a pitcher of water.  Ryo-ohki sat down on the boulder and set the tray
>down next to Washu. 
>
>"Good afternoon, Washu!" Tenchi greeted.
>
>"Hello, Tenchi." Washu looked at the energy ball,  studying it intensely. "OK,
>Yui,  I'm going to teach you your first lesson about using an energy
>discharge."

SHINJI:	<as Washu> First, rub your feet on the carpet.  Now touch a doorknob.

>
>"Um...ok," she said.
>
>"Tenchi, why don't you go over there and sit with Ryo-ohki?  You're done with 
>your lessons with her for today,"  said Washu.
>

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi as Obi-Wan Kenobi> You must go to the Masaki shrine. 
There you will learn from Washu, the Jedi Master who instructed me.

>"Sure, ok.  Since you're the only person qualified enough to teach her," he
>said with a smile.  Washu's out of her lab, she finally decided to step out,
>Tenchi thought.

LINA:	<as Tenchi> Now I can finally use the internet line she's been tying up
for 13 years.  Time to access www.juraibridegroomtraining.gov...

>He hadn't stepped into the lab for the past 13 years.  Ever since 
>the death of Ryoko,  Washu had been in that lab almost every time she had free 
>time. She's hiding something.  But he figured that he'd find out eventually. 

SHINJI:	Yep.  She's just waiting for that perfect time to get her "sample."

RYOKO:	As hentai as that was, Ikari, it's frighteningly possible.

>
>Tenchi sat down next to Ryo-ohki, who proceeded to pour him a cup of water.  
>"Thank you Ryo-ohki!"
>
>"Miya!" said the smiling humanoid.

CUTTER:	Shouldn't she be a felinoid?

INU-YASHA:	Or a lepinoid.

SHINJI:	I'm leaning towards carotenoid.

RYOKO:	Do you think that anyone would get those riffs?

LINA:	Yeah.  Any science geeks who read this MST.

RITSUKO:	<in comm window> I heard that!

>She turned her attention to Washu and Yui.
>
>Tenchi watched Yui and Washu intensely; this was bringing back happy memories 
>and buried memories. *It's almost time to reveal to Yui her concealed
>memories,* he thought with some worry.

CELCIA:	<as Tenchi> She'll have to endure all those Lemon fics stored away in
her cereberal cortex...

>
>"Okay, Yui!  Now that you have the energy discharge on your palm,  try
>throwing it like a baseball."  Washu looked for and found a suitable target,
>pointing at

INU-YASHA:	...Kagato, who some other pathetic author decided to resurrect yet
again for his fic.  Of course, the author landed Kagato in some other author's
fic...

SHINJI:	<as Kagato> I am actually starting to get bored with this.  Tenchi,
defeat me and get it over with, I was about to have brunch with Satan.

>a nearby rock. "Throw it in that direction."
>
>"Ok...like this?"  Yui hurled the blue discharge at the rock. BOOM!
>
>"Just like your mother, Yui,"  Washu said proudly. 

LINA:	<as Washu> Your aim sucks.

CUTTER:	<as Noboyuki> MY CAR!!!

	Ryoko flies up out of her seat, and snipes Lina and Cutter with energy
bolts.

RYOKO:	"Your aim sucks" indeed.

>
>"Wow!  That is cool!" Yui's eyes were bulging out of their sockets.  "I'm
>doing that again!"  She threw out another energy discharge,  this time aiming
>it at the lake.  A huge pillar of water exploded into the sky.
>
>Washu clearly saw that Yui was already aware that she had inherited her 
>mother's abilities,  but how far was her potential?  Now that she had finally 
>regained most of her powers - and some new ones

CELCIA:	Okay...when did she lose them to begin with?

>- Washu felt the inevitability
>of having to break the news of Yui's past to her.

LINA:	<as Washu> Yui...I'm sorry to have to tell you this...but you were
concieved as the result of a Lemon fic.

>
>"Alright Yui! Next and finally, I'm going to teach you how to materialize your 
>own energy sword."
>
>"You mean, like my mother's?"
>

SHINJI:	<as Washu> No, more like your father's...

CUTTER:	That small, huh?

	Ryoko returns to her seat, then blasts Shinji and Cutter.

>"Yes, like your mother's."
>

INU-YASHA:	That would mean her mother's really Ranma Saotome...

RYOKO:	SIT! 

	Inu-Yasha faceplants right into the same indentation he made earlier.
	
RYOKO:	I'm surrounded by Hentai!

>Yui brought out another energy discharge out of her hand before Washu could
>say a word.
>
>"I'm ready, Washu!"
>
>"All you have to do to bring out your sword is close your hand on the
>discharge," instructed Washu.
>
>"You mean like this?" Yui closed her hand on the energy discharge and a blue 
>energy sword forming from the compression. "Wow! Just like a light saber 
>straight out of Star Wars!"
>
>"Star -- what?" Washu asked.

	All the MSTers facefault.
	
LINA:	You've got to be kidding me...the self-proclaimed "most genius
scientist of the universe" hasn't seen Star Wars?  It's like...required viewing
or something!

>
>"Never mind," Yui said, remembering that Washu didn't really watch American 
>movies that much - if at all.
>
>"Now that you have your very own sword, why don't you test it?  See how it 
>works!"

INU-YASHA:	What's there to explain?  You swing it at something, it cuts!

RYOKO:	Knowing mom, she'd figure calculus into the theory somewhere.

>
>"Ok!" Yui said excitedly.  She ran over to a nearby tree and began to swing at 
>it.  Before she could take another swing, the trunk sliced into two, sliding
>off and falling on the ground. 

CUTTER:	Is it just me, or do trees in anime always have that delayed reaction
response whenever cut with a high-velocity blade?

SHINJI:	It's not just you.

>
>Tenchi and Ryo-ohki both clapped their hands, impressed.  Tenchi used it as a
>distraction to give a quick glance to Washu.  Washu picked up on the eye 
>contact.
>

RYOKO:	<Fuming> Mom, don't even think about it...

>"Ok, Yui.  Time to call it quits," Washu said, smiling.   
>
>"What? You mean I'm done *already*?" Yui asked. 
>
>Washu nodded.
>
>"That's all?  Isn't there more to learn??" Yui asked, hoping for more
surprises.
>
>"Nope, you have graduated.

CELCIA:	<as Washu as Yoda> No more training do you require.

>You've learned all that you needed to learn.  The 
>only thing that's left is..."
>
>"Is what?" Yui asked excitedly.
>

CELCIA:	<as Washu as Yoda> Vader.  You must confront Vader.

>"...is to practice and master those abilities."
> 
>Yui was disappointed. "...Alright."  She walked over to Ryo-ohki and her
>father, Ryo-ohki pouring a drink for Yui. "Thank you, Ryo-ohki."
>
>"You'd better head back to the house with Ryo-ohki, Yui," Tenchi directed. 
>"I need to speak with Washu alone."
>
>"Yes, I understand."  She picked up her bokken and left with the cabbit.
>
>Tenchi waited until Yui and Ryo-ohki were out of earshot, then turned to
>Washu.  Washu was standing there, thinking to herself.

LINA:	<as Washu, thinking> Heh...with my daughter out of the way, you're
MINE, Tenchi.

>
>"Well, she finally regained all her powers -- and some new ones," he said.  
>"What do you think will happen next?"

SHINJI:	But she hasn't...oh forget it.  If Pioneer won't maintain continuity
with a single Tenchi series, maybe we can overlook a few small breaks in
continuity with a few character details.

RYOKO:	Watch what you're willing to tolerate, Shinji.  What if ADV made a
"Shin Eva?"

	Shinji barfs.

>
>"Tomorrow I will be permitting you and the others in to the lab," said Washu.
>
>"Your lab?" he said curiously, not expecting this turn of events. "You're 
>finally giving us access to your lab?"
>
>"Yes."  She then silently walked off.
>

CUTTER:	<as Washu> I will be charging admission and giving discounts to AAA
members.

>*Man, what's with her anyways?*  Tenchi thought, trying to figure out why
>Washu had been acting so reclusive for the past 2 weeks.

INU-YASHA:	EverQuest, Ultima Online, or Minesweeper.  Any of the above would
do it.

>*Oh well, I'm going to go find out tomorrow, if not sooner or later...*
>
>                                                ***

INU-YASHA:	*Lovingness?*  Is that even a word?!

CUTTER:	Isn't that a weapon?  The Spear of Lovingness?

SHINJI:	That's *Longinuss,* Cutter.  This isn't "Sailor Eva."

RITSUKO:	Cut power.  Begin LCL drain.  Eject Entry Theater.

MISATO:	Break time, guys.  Grab a shower but keep your plug suits on, we've got
two more to go.  Cutter, Celcia, meet me in the briefing room.

	Several minutes and a shower later, Shinji is trying to grab a moment's
peace using the popular spot for such an activity, the roof.  This is rather
odd considering the nearest available roof is one of the pyramidal faces of the
NERV headquarters.  Fortunately Shinji's plug suit provides enough friction to
put some butt prints on Gendo's office window.  Shinji is soon joined by
Inu-Yasha, who grabs some surface nearby.

INU-YASHA:	Hey.   What are you doing up here?

	Shinji points at the previous narrative.

INU-YASHA:	Feh.  Who needs the fourth wall.

	Inu-Yasha situates himself against Gendo's window next to Shinji.
	
INU-YASHA:	I thought this was going to be a challenge.

SHINJI:	We've had worse, Inu-Yasha.  Believe me.  There's been a running joke
about you being Ryoko and Ranma's love-child.

INU-YASHA:	<Growls> Ryoko, that bitch...

SHINJI:	Speaking of which, have you seen some of the names in this fic?

INU-YASHA:	Yeah, so?

SHINJI:	Just wondering...there's Yui, Kaji, and Misato.  There are too many
Evangelion names in there for it to be a coincidence.  I mean, there was even a
Katushito Jinnai!  That's definitely someone from El Hazard.  Too specific to
be coincidental.

INU-YASHA:	Shinji, maybe you're reading a little too deep into it?

SHINJI:	Maybe, but this is NERV we're talking about.  If you read deep enough,
you can find a lot more truth than you bargained for.  Also, there is the
causality hole.  Who knows the depths of its effects?

INU-YASHA:	Eh, you have a point.  Okay.  So we can say that fic authors tend
to arbitrarily decide which surname a married couple takes, right?

SHINJI:	Right.  So we can't follow married names with much certainty.

INU-YASHA:	Well if the Yui in this fic is your mother...I don't know how you
explain the lack of resemblance...

SHINJI:	NERV, remember?  They screw with genes all the time.

INU-YASHA:	True.  Okay.  So if Yui's your mother...and Ryoko is Yui's
mother...then that would make Ryoko...

	Meanwhile, in the NERV cafeteria, Lina is, as usual, really putting away
the calories.  The dirty plates pile up as she attacks serving after serving. 
Ryoko is leaning back in a chair, having something lighter...it is yet
untouched by Lina, probably because Ryoko's guarding it.

RYOKO:	Wow, Lina, you're really going through that stuff.

LINA:	*bitechompmunchmunchgulpchompgulpcrunchchomp*

	Ritsuko, apparently exhausted, sits down in a chair.
	
RITSUKO:	Having to deal with that causality hole is painful.

RYOKO:	Oh?  What happened to Celcia and Cutter?

RITSUKO:	Oh, I'm putting Celcia in Eva-02 for a while to do some
synchronization experiments.  Cutter's gone home.

RYOKO:	<mutters> Lucky little...

LINA:	*bitechompmunchmunchgulpchompgulpcrunchchomp*

RITSUKO:	I'm trying to see how this next segment goes without elves.

RYOKO:	You know, Ritsuko, there's something I don't get.  Usually, when an MST
is done, it's done to a bad fic.  I mean we've seen Leaf-Chan, Tank Cop, and
Adam.  But this fic is at the other end of the extreme.

RITSUKO:	Probably observer bias.  You get Tenchi in this fic, after all.

RYOKO:	What I do to get Tenchi is my own business.  My point is that this is
actually a well-written fic with continuity with at least one Tenchi Muyo
series.  The characters have changed, but they haven't changed radically.  This
is not what I'd think of as MST bait.

RITSUKO:	That may be true, but this is the experement we are running.

RYOKO:	You realize that we're setting ourselves up to get seriously flamed. 
MST's are traditionally reserved for bad fics, and not only would the author
see this as assosciating his fic with bad work, but so would a bunch of
AHRLI's.  We could cook off a major conflict here.

RITSUKO:	Nothing that NERV hasn't done before.

RYOKO:	What?

RITSUKO:	Er...never mind.  In the meantime, we still need to control for
another variable, that is, the werewolf factor.  Newjersey's still recovering. 
So I pulled a substitute.

RYOKO:	Who, Jon Talbain?

RITSUKO:	Not exactly...

	Ryoko is quickly glomped from behind by Shinji.
	
RYOKO:	What the...

SHINJI:	GRANDMA!

RYOKO:	SHINJI, GET OFF ME!

LINA:	*bitechompmunchmunchgulpchompgulpcrunchchomp*

	Ritsuko ducks under a table while Shinji hugs Ryoko.  Apparently Ritsuko
anticipates death by plasma bolts for the pilot of Eva-01.

SHINJI:	I had to have family elsewhere!  Oh, Ryoko, Grandma!

RYOKO:	WHEN DID I END UP IN "SON OF DARKNESS?!"

PA:	<Gendo's voice> Would the MST group please assemble in the briefing room. 
Repeat.  Would the MST group please assemble in the briefing room, please.

	Back in the huge office of Gendo Ikari, where he still has his gloves up in
front of his face in that same pensive gesture...he puts the phone down.  It is
clear why he has his hands in that gesture...as his right glove is still
dangling from his face.

GENDO:	Fuyutski.

FUYUTSKI:	Yes, Commander Ikari.

GENDO:	Krazy Glue is tenacious stuff, isn't it?

FUYUTSKI:	Yes, it is.

GENDO:	Fuyutski.

FUYUTSKI:	Yes?

GENDO:	<still glaring forward> Who is responsible for the butt-prints on my
window?

FUYUTSKI:	That would be Shinji and Inu-Yasha.

GENDO:	And who would be the person out there right now cleaning them?

	Outside the window off to Gendo's right, a man in coveralls is on a
rapelling line, spraying the windows and applying a squeegee.  The man has
shoulder-length green hair and carries a blonde-haired doll in the crook of his
arm.

SERAVY:	Oh, just a passing-by window washer.

ELIZABETH:	And I'm his assistant.

	Later, in the briefing room, Misato is sitting at the table where Gendo
would sit, she being senior in the chain of command.  Ritsuko is standing by
her side.  Around the table are Shinji (hugging Ryoko), Ryoko (trying to pry
Shinji off), Inu-Yasha, and Lina.

RYOKO:	WILL YOU LET GO OF ME?

SHINJI:	Okay, grandma.

RYOKO:	I'm NOT your grandma!

INU-YASHA:	So you deny being Yui's mother?

RYOKO:	She's the daughter of me and Tenchi!  I wouldn't deny loving Tenchi!

SHINJI:	GRANDMA!

RYOKO:	I'll get you for that, Inu-Yasha...

MISATO:	If we could have your attention?

LINA:	Sure.  Okay, we're through the first part, now what?  Once again, we're
short two MSTers.

MISATO:	Well, we did manage to use the causality hole once again.  First, we
have to install the Werewolf factor.  Riiya, would you come in here?

	Enter Riiya, a blue-haired boy with a ponytail wearing, you guessed it, a
plug suit.  He has his hands in the pockets.  On his right wrist above the
sealing switch is an ornate bracelet.

RIIYA:	Hello.  When's lunch?

SHINJI:	Uh...Lina ate it.

RIIYA:	WHAT?!

RITSUKO:	We'll get you some food before the MST, Riiya.

LINA:	Oh gee, Ritsuko, how come I never get fed before an MST?

RITSUKO:	....

RYOKO:	Okay...so we've filled out the fifth seat, but what about the sixth? 
What's the variable this time?

MISATO:	Eh heh...funny you should ask.  Princess, would you come in, please?

	Enter...Princess Aeka, Ryoko's rival for Tenchi's love.  She is already
wearing a plug suit, and as soon as she enters, her demure look turns
murderous.

RYOKO AND AEKA:	<each pointing at the other> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

RITSUKO:	Amazing, this didn't happen with the Cav and Dav experiments.

RYOKO:	Ritsuko, you ditz!  Both she and I are out of the same continuity! 
That's why!   When I was in Cav and Dav's theater, they pulled Aeka out of the
TV continuity!  She's OAV Aeka!  Of COURSE she'll know me!

MISATO:	Are you sure this is a good idea?

SHINJI:	Grandma, who's she?

RYOKO:	STOP CALLING ME THAT!

AEKA:	Ryoko...<snickers>...you're...a grandma?  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!

RYOKO:	Laugh now, Aeka...just wait until you see what's awaiting you.

AEKA:	HAHAHAHAHA!  GRANDMA!

	Later, in the Entry Theater, the MSTers take their seats.  The seating
order is...Ryoko, Shinji, Aeka, Inu-Yasha, Lina, Riiya.  In central dogma are
Misato, Ritsuko, Maya, Shigeru, and Makato.

RYOKO:	Hope you've been well fed, Riiya.

RIIYA:	Yep!

RITSUKO:	Filling the Entry Theater.

RIIYA:	What the...

AEKA:	Oh my, what is this...

RITSUKO:	Power supply connected.  Commencing activation system.  Initiating
first stage connections.   Voltage climbing to border-line.  Initiating second
stage connections.  Theatre has activated.

MISATO:	LAUNCH!

	Eva-02 launches on its catapault...despite the fact that Celcia, who was
riding for a sync experiment, is still in it.

MAYA:	Er...wrong button...

MISATO:	Ergh...let's try this again.  LAUNCH!

>Tenchi Muyo: Ryoko's Love...

AEKA:	...Forever unrequited.

RYOKO:	<smirks> You wish.

AEKA:	And just *what* do you mean by that?

LINA:	Aeka, just to give you warning...this may be especially painful for
you.

>Prologue Chapter 2: Nightmare, Memory, and Revelation

INU-YASHA:	Aren't those three books of the Bible?

SHINJI:	No, that would be Revelation, Air, and Heart.

RYOKO AND AEKA:	Much to our dismay.

SHINJI:	Think you could share some of that ego with me?  I think I need a
transplant.

>

LINA:	Well, you must still have friends, this fic wasn't half bad so far.  I
can't figure out why we're MSTing it.

SHINJI:	Because Ritsuko wants to see what would happen?

RIIYA:	Because Gendo is an incredibly sadistic bastard?

LINA:	A little of column A, a little of column B.

>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>

RYOKO:	EEEYACK!

AEKA:	What?  What's the matter?

RYOKO:	Nothing...just a force of habit.  Every time I see that kind of page
break, I keep thinking "Tank Cop."  Something this author really doesn't need
to be identified with.

AEKA:	Why are you sucking up to the author?

RYOKO:	Just trying to be a little objective here.

>Late April 2005

RIIYA:	12:04 p.m.

LINA:	Going for that X-files effect there?

>Yui 

SHINJI:	Grandma! <glomps Ryoko>

	Ryoko tries to pry Shinji off again while Aeka is trying, and failing, to
stifle her laughs.

RYOKO:	This isn't funny!  Shinji, get OFF!

>awoke to find herself lying on her stomach. Barely conscious, all she could
>hear were loud explosions. She opened her eyes, only to be greeted by hazed
>vision; all she could feel was smoldering heat and the vibrations

INU-YASHA:	LEMON ALERT!

SHINJI:	<releasing Ryoko> What?!  What are you talking about?

INU-YASHA:	She's lying on her stomach, barely conscious, her vision is blurry,
she feels smoldering heat and vibrations.  She's probably under the influence
of a date rape drug or something...

RYOKO:	Inu-Yasha...I don't think we've seen any hentai content since this fic
started.  You are one sick-minded half-demon.  Either that, or I slammed you
into the floor one too many times.

AEKA:	You would be so violent, Ryoko.

RYOKO:	Hey, it wasn't my fault, lady!  That necklace Inu-Yasha wears has some
wierd spell or something on it.  Every time someone says 'sit...'

	Inu-Yasha faceplants into his usual indentation in the floor.
	
INU-YASHA:	OW!  HEY!
	
AEKA:	Oh my....isn't that only supposed to work for one person?

LINA:	Yeah.  Kagome.  I don't know why it reacts to everyone here.  Might be
the problems with causality, or the fact that this is NERV and wierd stuff
happens here anyway.

AEKA:	Well, then, let me try.  <ahem> SIT!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants again.
	
INU-YASHA:	<muttering> they are all going to die...

>of a violently moving floor. She wanted to stand and find out what was
>happening, but the rest of her body only responded with pain. In time, her
>vision returned to her, and she could see.

RIIYA:	<as Televangelist> Be *healed,* sister Yui!

REST OF CAST:	Ayyyyyyyyyyy-MEN!

>There were two combatants ahead, engaged in mortal combat as they leapt at and
>charged at each other. One of them was in a magnificent red-and-black striped

SHINJI:	<glomps Ryoko again> Grandma!!!  I love you, Grandma!

RYOKO:	Shinji, I am NOT your grandmother!

AEKA:	Well, considering you're over two thousand years old, it's certainly
possible...

RYOKO:	You are NOT helping!

>when she noticed the red gems,

LINA:	Shikon Jewels!

INU-YASHA:	MINE!  <Jumps at the screen and once again gets bounced off the AT
field>

RYOKO:	That was too easy.  ACK!  Shinji!  Quit hugging me!  I gotta be a
mother to Tenchi's child before I can be a grandmother!

SHINJI:	Well technically...

RYOKO:	Don't you dare spoil the surprise for her.

SHINJI:	Okay, I won't, grandma.

RYOKO:	And stop calling me grandma!

>one in each wrist and one in the base of her neck. As her vision cleared, she
>saw that the wings befitted an angel;

SHINJI:	<releasing Ryoko> Angel?!  Oh no, is the pattern blue?

RIIYA:	Another force of habit?

LINA:	'Fraid so.

AEKA:	<as Yui> Eeeek!  It's an SI!

>This woman wore a peculiar black-and-white battlesuit, had short mid-trimmed

RYOKO:	<imitating John Walsh> If you should happen to see her, call America's
Most Wanted at 1-800-CRIME-00.

>She shot a glance at Yui, and a surge of pain wracked the young one's body.

RIIYA:	If looks could...

REST OF CAST:	HEARD IT!

>*Too much hurt!  Too much to bear!* Yui thought... then she screamed.
>
>"Yui!"  yelled Ryoko, looking over at her screaming four year-old daughter
>while trying to fend off her enemy's blade.

AEKA:	i.e., Social Services.

RYOKO:	That was low, Aeka.

AEKA:	Well, a pirate would not make a fit mother...or grandmother...

	Shinji glomps Ryoko again.

>Horrified at seeing Yui being tortured by high-voltage electricity,

INU-YASHA:	As opposed to being tortured by a 9-volt battery...

MISATO:	<ICW> Watch the nitpicking, guys.

>Ryoko became gravely worried about her daughter's health.
> 

RIIYA:	No, really, ya think?

SHINJI:	Do you worry about my health too, grandma?

RYOKO:	Shinji...*mmf*...you should worry about your own health if you don't
let go of me...

>"Onimaru!" Ryoko screamed at her foe,

RIIYA:	<as Chacha> BEAUTY SERENE ARROW!  MAGICAL SHOOT!

SHINJI:	<as Ranma> HIRYUU-SHOTEN-HA!

INU-YASHA:	STEEL-CLEAVING FANG!

AEKA:	OJOSAMA TO OYOBI! <cracks whip>

LINA:	DRAGON SLAVE!

	Ryoko dives behind her seat, carrying Shinji with her.
	
AEKA:	What...

RYOKO:	Aeka, meet Lina Inverse, she can cast a spell with the effect of a
small tactical nuke.  We're in close quarters.  You do the math.

LINA:	Come on, I have to do a lot more before I can cast Dragon Slave.  And
besides, I think "Onimaru" is a person, not a technique.

	Ryoko and Shinji resume their seats.
	
SHINJI:	Hey Aeka, isn't that Newjersey's whip?

AEKA:	Oh...I'm just borrowing it.  I did teach him how to use it, after all. 
Hmmm...maybe I should go over this autograph again.  This liquid is wearing it
off.

>face to face, sword to sword. "You'll pay for what you've done to my daughter! 

RYOKO:	Damn right she'll pay.

>Why? Why Yui and not me?!  Yui didn't deserve that!

INU-YASHA:	Yui didn't deserve to marry Gendo, either.

SHINJI:	Grandma! <Glomps Ryoko>

RYOKO:	Shinji...once again...I am NOT your grandma!

AEKA:	I don't think Tenchi would want to marry a single *grandmother,* Ryoko. 
Face it.  Your chances are shot.

RYOKO:	Just watch the fic, honey, and you'll see who gets the last laugh.

>I'm going to kill you, Onimaru!" Tears welled up in her eyes.
>
>"Not until you pay YOUR price from our last battle, Ryoko!" scowled the green-
>eyed woman. 

LINA:	<as Onimaru> You still owe me twenty bucks!

>"Your bearing of this child is to my advantage and will be the contributing
>factor to your own death!"
>
>"Shut up, you bitch!"  Ryoko swung her sword in pure rage at Onimaru, scoring

INU-YASHA:	...with her.

RYOKO:	SIT!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants yet again.
	
RITSUKO:	We are going to have to reinforce the floor of the theater, aren't
we?

RYOKO:	<thinking> The time I spent with Cav and Dav is going to haunt me,
isn't it?

>a direct hit on Onimaru's arm.  Onimaru stepped back in pain -- then suddenly, 
>to Ryoko's surprise, she proceeded to regenerate the wound there, wiping it
>from existence in little more than a few seconds.  Onimaru  then threw out a 
>dark energy wave from her sword at Ryoko;  Ryoko put up her Light Hawk Wings 
>just in time to shield herself from the blast.

AEKA:	Just a minute...Ryoko can form Light Hawk Wings?

RYOKO:	They haven't released that part of the OAV yet, Aeka.  Just watch.

>
>Yui could only guess what was going on; she was confused through the pain.
>Suddenly, she was lifted off the ground; somebody was picking her up! She
>looked up and saw  her father, Tenchi.

AEKA:	Wait...if Ryoko is Yui's mother...and Tenchi is her father...<looks
horrified> then...

RYOKO:	Thaaaaats right, Aeka.

AEKA:	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  TENCHI!  HOW COULD YOU?

INU-YASHA:	And if Yui is Shinji's mother...

RYOKO:	SI...<gets glomped by Shinji before she can get half the word
out>...ACK!  SHINJI!

SHINJI:	Grandma, it's true!  You're my grandma!

RYOKO:	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  INU-YASHA!  HOW COULD YOU?

>He was using his Light Hawk Wings, shining brightly in all his splendor.  A
>sense of profound relief swept over Yui.

RIIYA:	Real good, Tenchi, now could you use those black-hole-overwhelming
Light Hawk Wings and cover your wife's ass?!

RYOKO:	<still trying to pry Shinji off again> I'm wishing I could do that
right now, myself.

>
>"D-daddy?"  She felt her father's healing aura,  her pain beginning to subside
>a little.
>
>"I'm here, Yui," he said soothingly, holding the fragile girl in his arms. 

RIIYA:	<as Tenchi> Who's yo daddy?  <catching a glare from Ryoko> never mind.

>
>"D-daddy...I want t-to g-go home,"  Yui said, resisting the urge to shiver 
>lest she lose more blood. blood. "I'm s-scared."   
>
>"Don't worry, your mommy and I will get you home." Tenchi held Yui closer, 
>trying to keep her from shivering, keeping her warm and secure.  He looked up 
>to see Ryoko locked in battle with Onimaru.

SHINJI:	Well, that's role reversal for you...the male takes care of the
offspring, the female engages in combat?

LINA:	Sorta like you, except your dad couldn't give a damn.

>From an initial glance, Ryoko was 
>holding  out well, but she was obviously injured;  a stream of blood poured 
>from her forehead.

INU-YASHA:	Well, if this is anime physics, she should have about nine or ten
liters left.  She'll be fine.

>The sudden sound of footsteps from behind caused Tenchi to
>instinctively turn; it was Aeka, wearing her full Jurian battle suit. 

RYOKO:	...From Ralph Lauren of Jurai!

>
>"I've arrived, Lord Tenchi!" Aeka yelled out.  She noticed Yui in Tenchi's
>arms, then looked across the chamber to see Ryoko fighting Onimaru.  Aeka
>watched the battle with great concern for Ryoko's safety,

SHINJI:	Isn't that a bit of an incongruity?

AEKA:	Shinji, I'll have you know that I would of course be concerned for
Ryoko's safety in such a situation!  There are times when such petty squabbles
must be put aside for the sake of others!

RYOKO:	Yep, she's definitely OAV Aeka.  Shin Aeka wouldn't have given a damn.

SHINJI:	I guess I was wrong, grandma.

RYOKO:	DON'T CALL ME GRANDMA!

>unable to help due to the unstable energy in the air.
>
>"Aeka! Take Yui back to Mihoshi's shuttle!"  Tenchi said, carefully handing
>Yui over to the Juraian queen. "And head back to Earth as soon as possible! 
>That's your priority!"

INU-YASHA:	<Sarcastically> Feh.  Yui will really be safer in Mihoshi's
shuttle.

AEKA:	She's not an airhead in every continuity.

INU-YASHA:	I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about the fact that she
crashes the shuttle in every continuity!

AEKA:	Oh, my, you're right!  <to the Aeka on screen> TAKE HER TO THE RYO-OH
OR THE RYO-OHKI IF YOU VALUE THAT CHILD'S LIFE!

>
>"I will Tenchi, but what are you going to do?" Aeka asked.
>
>"I have to help Ryoko. But don't worry about us -- get Yui off this

>
>"I understand, Tenchi.  Good luck,"  she said, holding on to Yui with care.

LINA:	<as Aeka, thinking> And when Ryoko dies in battle, I can put the moves
on Tenchi!

AEKA:	I AM NOT OUT OF SHIN TENCHI!  I have more decency than that!

>Then with a loud hiss, the energy envelope fluctuated and dissipated.  Ryoko

RIIYA:	She's gonna transform into Magical Princess Sexy-Up!

>Ryoko let out a battle cry --

INU-YASHA:	<as Ryoko>	SPOOOOOOOON!

> Onimaru's blade started to react to Ryoko's energy discharge -- then a huge
>explosion occurred.

RYOKO:	Uh, this can't be good.

>The force of the explosion sent a piece of shrapnel into Aeka's side, causing
>her to fall over with Yui in her arms, Aeka yelping in pain.

AEKA:	Now this is a little one-sided...Ryoko's bleeding out of her head and
still able to fight, meanwhile I take a tiny piece of shrapnel in the side and
I go down?  It's not fair!

LINA:	Well, I have heard that this fic is required reading for AHRLI's.

>As Aeka tried to 
>regain her bearings, Yui painfully crept out of Aeka's arms and back to the

>"Yui! Come back!" Aeka yelled out, struggling to stand up, doing her best to

>Yui ignored Aeka; she didn't want to run away while her parents were in
>danger.  

SHINJI:	<as Yui> I mustn't run away...I mustn't run away...I mustn't run
away...

>She finally reached the doorway to the chamber; the first thing she saw was
>Tenchi fighting Onimaru's shadow.  
>
>Tenchi turned around to find Yui standing in the doorway; an expression of 
>horror went across his face.  "Yui! What are you doing here? I told you to go 
>back home!  It's too dangerous!"

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi> There's an overpowered SI here and it'll write us all
into a tentacle Lemon if we're not careful!

RIIYA:	Uh...this character isn't really an SI.

LINA:	No.  There never was, really, but the high power on this antagonist
brings SI's to mind.  Apologies to the author.

INU-YASHA:	Wow.  The MSTer apologizes to the author.  This is a first.

>
>Yui didn't respond. Tenchi continued to fight the shadow with his Light Hawk 
>Sword. 
>
>Suddenly, an unmistakably evil voice rang out. "So, the 'Miracle Child' has 
>returned to witness her mother's death!"
>

RYOKO:	<as Yui> I'm gonna be the Harry Potter of anime!

>Yui looked over to where the true Onimaru stood.  She could only watch in
>horror as her mother was being beaten down to the floor,  pummeled into the
>ground by Onimaru's fists and stomped on by the green-eyed woman's boots.

SHINJI:	So Onimaru is on all fours jumping up and down on Ryoko?

INU-YASHA:	Unless she has detachable body parts.

>Ryoko continued to endure the beating unwilling to give up.  She tried to
>stand, but was knocked back down by a punch to the face;

RIIYA:	<singing> o/~ I get knocked down...But I get up again...You're never
gonna keep me down... o/~

>she vomited blood from the gag reflex
>and collapsed backwards.

AEKA:	That's one powerful punch to drop Ryoko twice!

LINA:	It's anime physics.  Cool moves either get slowed down or repeated in
time.

>As Ryoko struggled to get up from her position, Onimaru bended down and picked
>her up by the neck.  
>
>"This time you've lost, Ryoko!" Onimaru said proudly. "How does it feel to be 
>the one receiving all the damage?"
>
>"I've had worse," Ryoko replied, her voice struggling from the pain.

INU-YASHA:	<as Onimaru> You liar!

SHINJI:	<as Ryoko> Come on, ya pansy!
 
>
>Ryoko was held up in the air like a twisted trophy; her suit was torn, she
>was cut and blemished, 

LINA:	...her nails were broken, her hair was messed up...

RYOKO:	Lina, this hair can't be messed up by anything short of a nuclear
blast.

LINA:	Oh?  Let's find out.  Darkness beyond twilight...

REST OF CAST:	NO!!!

>and there were bloodstains everywhere. She futilely
>tried to free herself from the red-haired woman's grasp.
>
>Not wanting to look into her enemy's face any longer, Ryoko turned her head,
>only to see something worse: her daughter standing in the far doorway. The
>look of unadulterated terror on Yui's face caused Ryoko to break into tears.
>*Why must Yui see this happen to me? WHY?*

SHINJI:	It must be a tradition by generations.  I saw mom disappear in the Eva
facility...mom saw grandma get killed...

RYOKO:	Shinji, would it matter if I beat the fact into your head?

>
>"Yui..." Ryoko begged, her voice giving out. "Please...don't watch..." 
>
>Yui stood paralyzed, not knowing what to do.
>
>"You should've listened to your mother, little girl." Onimaru said, hefting
>Ryoko into the air as far as she could go with a triumphant smile.  
>

RIIYA:	She lifted her with a smile?!  Those are some strong lips!

>"Please don't kill her!"  Yui begged from afar, watching helplessly as Onimaru 
>materialized a sword in her free hand.  The dark sword was shining fresh and 
>glorious, darker than the depths of night.

LINA:	Oh no...the narrator is going to use the Dragon Slave?!  Oh wait.  That
would be Ragna Blade.

>She pulled it back, preparing to 
>strike...    
>
>***

INU-YASHA:	And she struck three times.  *stabstabstab*

>Yui forced herself to wake up; she was sweating hard, eyes wide open, trying
>to forget the re-occurring nightmare.  And she hyperventilated, she tried to
>forget the memory that haunted her for most of her life.  Why did it keep
>reoccurring?  Why must she have this same nightmare?  She knew that it was a
>memory - but couldn't remember anything beyond that.

SHINJI:	<as Morpheus> Have you ever had a dream, Yui, that you were so sure was
real...

>
>She finally calmed down and looked over at the clock. 10:30 AM. *Time for
>breakfast.* She got up from bed, and changed out of her pajamas into her
>casual wear,  a pair of black close-fitting shorts and a short-sleeved shirt 
>that said 'hello'.

INU-YASHA:	Whoa...her chest is greeting me...

RYOKO:	SIT!

	And the word produces the usual effect.

>She tied her long cyan hair back into a ponytail, then
>looked over to a picture attached to the wall mirror she was looking into.
>It was a picture of her mother.  In the picture, her mother was wearing a
>light blue colored dress with a black bow tie; it was one of her favorite
>casual outfits, according to her father.  Yui stared at the picture for a
>while, focusing on her mother's smile; her mother was a very beautiful woman.  

	Aeka snickers, Ryoko glares at her.

>She then looked at herself in the mirror and studied her resemblance to Ryoko. 
>
>***

AEKA:	And she looked like three asterisks in a row.

>
>Meanwhile, Aeka and Sasami had already arrived downstairs; they'd been at the 
>house since dawn.  Tenchi was also already awake,  sitting in the living room 
>on the couch across from Aeka.  Sasami was in the kitchen, happily cooking up 
>some breakfast with Ryo-ohki

LINA:	Mmmmm...cabbit omlettes.

RIIYA:	That is sick, Lina.

>on her usual spot on the top of Sasami's head.  
>Aeka sipped her tea, enjoying her conversation with Tenchi.
>
>"So that's all that happened at the meeting?" Tenchi asked.
>
>"Yes; the representatives were all happy about passing the bill." Aeka said.

INU-YASHA:	<as Aeka> In fact, it only took two bottles of laxative.

LINA:	FIREBALL! <blasts Inu-Yasha> I make the puns!

>"In fact, they were so happy that they all decided to proclaim a new holiday."
>
>"What? Another new holiday?!" Tenchi exclaimed.

RYOKO:	Wow.  They really got bored without me terrorizing them.

>
>"Yes.  It's called, 'Hooray, We Finally Passed the Bill Day!'  Shoji named the 
>holiday himself."
>
>"Only Shoji would have the 

SHINJI:	<as Tenchi> ...complete and utter lack of originality...

>sense of humor and charisma to give a name like that 
>to a new holiday."
>
>"Yes, he would," Aeka replied.
>
>"Very interesting.  I guess I can't blame him for being so happy; after all, 
>the bill took at least two years of deliberation," Tenchi noted.
>
>"Yes, 2 very LONG years." She smiled.

RYOKO:	Say, Aeka, what would the Juraian year translate to in Earth time?

AEKA:	I haven't thought about that too much...but I'll grant you this, 2
years to get a bill passed is a record.

RYOKO:	That long?

AEKA:	That short.
 
>
>"So,  how's the Empress of Jurai business been coming along?" he asked. "And 
>how's Shoji? How long has it been now, 17 years?"
>
>"Yes, 17 years..." she replied, "...since I took his hand in marriage."

LINA:	<as Aeka> It's still sitting in a jar of formaldehyde with the ring on
the finger.

RIIYA:	Took his hand...what is it with magic users and puns?!  If they came up
in her spells, she'd be more dangerous than Chacha!

>
>"My, how time flies." 
>
>*18 years have passed since you married Ryoko as well,* thought Aeka to
>herself.

RYOKO:	Um...okay...if I could nitpick just a tiny bit here?  But...that
implies that I married Aeka.

	Aeka barfs.  Inu-Yasha snickers.
	
RIIYA:	Gross!  Isn't that the same stuff we breathe?  That's all floating
around now!

SHINJI:	You learn to live with it.  With some of these fics, you hope to choke
to death on it.

AEKA:	Me?  Marry HER?!

RYOKO:	You missed the first section of this, Aeka.  There was a fleeting
El-Hazard reference.

INU-YASHA:	Yeah, but so far there have been many names taken from EVANGELION!

SHINJI:	<glomps Ryoko tighter> GRANDMA!

RYOKO:	Shinji, will you STOP THAT!

>She felt a little depressed, naturally; it was supposed to have been HER who
>would marry Tenchi, not Ryoko... 

AEKA:	Um...which continuity is this?

LINA:	Try not to nitpick too much.  This is a good fic.  We rarely get these.

>
>*How selfish of me to even think of that!* she thought, getting upset at her
>own thoughts.  She greatly admired the display of love the Masaki men showed
>for their deceased wives:  Yosho and his wife;  Nobuyuki and Achika; and, of 
>course, Tenchi and Ryoko.

SHINJI:	A display of love for dead wives?  It sounds like they're hitting on
corpses or something.  There's that necrophelia again...

RYOKO:	I think he means "devotion," Shinji.

SHINJI:	Sorry, grandma.

RYOKO:	AAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!

>
>Aeka started thinking about how naïve she used to be, hoping to win Tenchi's 
>love in the old days; it took her a while after the wedding to finally accept 
>the reality that she was never going to have him.  Ever since Shoji came
>along, though, winning Tenchi's heart didn't matter all that much to Aeka
>anymore;

LINA:	...now what mattered was winning Tenchi's spleen.

>she 
>was still fond of Tenchi, but not as much as before.  For 17 years now, she
>had been happily married.   
>
>Another thought flew across Aeka's mind.  She started thinking about the state
>of the family since Ryoko's death; Aeka felt fortunate that she had been able 
>to help Tenchi raise his daughter.  After the funeral, Yui didn't speak to 
>anybody for 11 months.  What would've happened if she hadn't ever been there
>to help?

SHINJI:	She would have sunk into a depression, run away to live with a teacher,
then get called back to pilot a giant biomechanical war machine.

>It was her duty -- and her right -- to help Tenchi.  Now, 14 years later, 
>instead of being Tenchi's 2nd wife, she was something else...something a
>little better. She was Yui's godmother, and

RIIYA:	...she could make Tenchi an offer he couldn't refuse.

RYOKO:	<as Tenchi> EEEEYYYAAAHH!  THERE'S A CABBIT HEAD IN MY BED!

>still a close friend to Tenchi.  Aeka felt 
>more like a guardian angel than a friend or family member, watching over the

>
>Tenchi looked over at the wall clock. 11:00 AM. 
>
>"Well, it's time to visit Ryoko," he said, getting up from the sofa and

LINA:	...blowing his own brains out with a Glock.

	Ryoko facefaults.
	
AEKA:	Well...that's one way to go to your deceased loved ones...

>heading out the back door.
>  
>"Let me accompany you, Tenchi," Aeka said, standing and following Tenchi out 
>towards the lake. 
>
>"By all means," Tenchi replied.
>
>Sasami stepped out of the kitchen, clad in cooking apron and cabbit on her
>head.

SHINJI:	Of course, that was all she was clad in.

AEKA:	<as Sasami> You mean I can actually have clothes on in this fic?  Whew! 
I have been in way too many lemons.

>
>"Breakfast is ready!" She looked around and realized she was alone. *Where are 
>Tenchi and Aeka?  ...Right. They must be out at the lake visiting Ryoko's 
>grave.*
>
>Washu emerged from her lab, stretching her arms and yawning.  She looked very 
>tired from working the whole night.
>
>"Good morning, sister Washu," greeted Sasami.
	
SHINJI:	Since when did Washu become a nun?!

RIIYA:	I think that's a term of endearment from one woman to another, when
they consider themselves close enough to be sisters.

SHINJI:	You know, I should have known that...I think we're all dubbed.

>
>"Oh, good morning, Tsunami." Washu took great care to seal the lab door shut.
>
>Sasami groaned a little bit at the sound of her other name.  She didn't hate
>the  name Tsunami; she was just too used to the name Sasami. 
>
>"Oh...sorry, Sasami."
>
>"It's ok, Washu," Sasami smiled. Her smile was quickly replaced by a serious
>expression. "I know that you were up all last night working on her."
>
>"So you know about Ryoko," replied Washu.

INU-YASHA: INCEST!

RYOKO:	SIT!  <Inu-Yasha faceplants.>

>
>"Yes.  I've known about everything for quite some time now," Sasami said.  
>Ever since Sasami had fully assimilated with Tsunami 8 years ago,

AEKA:	<as Tsunami of Borg> Resistance is futile.

> her
>perspective on the universe had increased exponentially.  She was able to see 
>different dimensions, different time periods, and different lives, all 
>intermingling with each other in one unified continuity.

SHINJI:	It was like one bad trip in the Entry Plug...

INU-YASHA:	Or a trip through the bone-eater's well...

LINA:	Or a poorly-written soap opera...

>Sasami would sometimes get headaches from looking at so many things all at
>once; fortunately for her she could turn her high-dimensional perspective on
>and off at will.
>
>"Really?" said Washu.
>
>"Yes. Really," Sasami replied.
>
>"How long has it been since I got your attention?" Washu asked. "I'm assuming
>2 weeks ago..."

RYOKO:	<as Washu> Sasami?  Sasami...Sasami, will you quit being distracted by
shiny objects?  Put your attention span in this reality, please!

>
>"Yes, that's right. Of course, I have no objections of her coming

INU-YASHA:	<snickers> I think the author just set himself up here...

	Aeka grips her headband and her little shield units appear around
Inu-Yasha...

SHINJI:	AEKA, WAIT!  THIS IS LCL!  IT'S AN ELECTROLYTE AND CONDUCTIVE TO...

	The shield units discharge, electrocuting everyone in the Entry Theater.
	
ALL:	Ouch...

>Sasami said with a smile,  "even though you're breaking that cardinal rule of

>death; now, though, Sasami could feel the gems' active algorithms.

LINA:	So the gems can write software now?

RYOKO:	I think she means *biorhythms.*

>
>"I knew you wouldn't object, Sasami. ...And I'm not breaking that cardinal

RIIYA:	So going to Washu for medical care is like taking a trip to Jiffy Lube?

AEKA:	<as commercial announcer> Yes, for only $19.99, you can not only have
your engine flushed and injectors cleaned, but you can have your driver treated
in the same way!

>Only at a very atomic level-" Washu frowned. "-and I don't plan to do that
>ever again."
>
>"Well, if that's how it really is, then I won't think about it any further," 
>Sasami said. "By the way, when is she going to be reunited with us? ...Her

>"Well, the regeneration process has already been underway for quite some time 
>now; it won't be finished until tomorrow.  That's the easy part!"
>
>"What's the hard part?"

INU-YASHA:	<as Washu> Oh, that would be her skeleton.

RYOKO:	A non-hentai comment from the half-demon?  This is new.

>
>"The hard part... is getting her memory back intact."
>
>"I see." Sasami's smile faltered.
>
>"Which is a no big deal for a genius scientist like myself. That is,
>unless..." Washu began, dropping a hint.

SHINJI:	...which promptly shattered on the floor.

AEKA:	<as Washu> Oh darn, those hints are kinda fragile.

>
>"...unless I help?"
>
>"Yes.  To help speed things up a little bit," she said, trying to maintain her
>proud façade.
>
>Sasami paused and thought about Washu's offer, then smiled.
>
>"I'll be more than happy to help you out, sister Washu."

LINA:	<as Sasami> I'll make a contribution to the convent.  Is one million
Jurai enough?

>
>"Thank you, Sasami."
>
>"Don't even thank me.  I'm just returning the favor."
>
>"Thanks anyways," Washu said gratuitously. 
>
>"Ryoko did save the universe on two separate occasions.  Otherwise, Tokimi 
>would've taken over..."

INU-YASHA:	<as Sasami> ...but instead, now Bill Gates can take everything over
and hold the universe hostage with crappy operating systems!

AEKA:	And I thought Ryoko was bad...

>
>"Yes, she did." Washu beamed with maternal pride. "The universe and the fate 
>of all life that exists in it fell to her, and she performed well."
>
>"When do we start?"
>
>"First thing tomorrow morning.  I just need to get the basic schematics down 
>before we can start anything."
>
>"Alright.  Does this mean you'll be using the bridge of the Tsunami?"
>
>"Yes. The bridge is an absolutely essential element in restoring Ryoko back
>her memories."  

RIIYA:	Wouldn't that be like setting up her the bomb?

RYOKO:	<as Washu> Yes.  All her memory are belong to her.

>Washu started back into the lab, but before she could fully step through the

>
>"Washu."
>
>"Yes, Sasami?"

RIIYA:	He remembered three asterisks in a row.

LINA:	Hey, I wonder how Celcia's doing.

	Meanwhile, atop Tokyo-3...Eva-02 seems to be lost.  Not lost as in a
Ryoga-sense, but lost as in...

CELCIA:	What the hell am I doing?!

	Celcia, still in her plug suit, is riding in Eva-02's entry plug.
	
MISATO:	<in comm window> Celcia, calm down, we'll get you Eva-02 back in the
cage.  Er...Ritsuko, shouldn't we have another Rei around?

RITSUKO:	<in another comm window> I destroyed all the backup dummies,
remember?  We lost our last Rei in Third Impact.  I think she went on to do
MST's with Ksawarrior.

CELCIA:	Will you cut it out with the background and tell me how to stop this
thing?!

RITSUKO:	<in Comm window> Maya, eject the entry plug.

MAYA:	<overheard, deadpan> no good, the signal's not being recieved.  Like
the last time.

MISATO: <ICW> Haven't you ever considered fixing the emergency eject mechanism?

RITSUKO:	<ICW> There's a thought...

MISATO:	<ICW> Celcia, walk your way over to the catapault pad.  We'll retrieve
you from there.

CELCIA:	<uneasily> Okay...

	Eva-02 starts walking its way back, following the power umbilical.

ASUKA:	<ICW> WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY EVA-02, ELF?!

CELCIA:	It wasn't my idea to go on a synchronization test!

RITSUKO:	<ICW> She's doing rather well, apparently.  She's already
synchronized.

GENDO:	<ICW, still has his hands in front of his face> What does this mean,
Dr. Akagi?

	The Eva starts to deviate from its course, walking right into a building.
	
FUYUTSKI:	<ICW> Watch where you're driving.

ASUKA:	<ICW> YEAH!  WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING!  DON'T SCRATCH MY EVA!

CELCIA:	I can't help it!  I've got all these comm windows open!  I can't see
where I'm going!

GENDO:	<ICW> It would seem that the elf has the right kind of attributes for
an Eva pilot.

ASUKA:	<ICW> What?!

RITSUKO:	<ICW> She can readily synchronize with Eva-02.

CELCIA:	Could you take this to another line of communication so I can see?

ASUKA:	<ICW> You stay out of this!

MISATO:	<ICW> Honestly, Asuka, you're so territorial over Eva-02!  If we want
her for a pilot, we'll build her her own Evangelion!

RITSUKO:	<ICW> I don't know, Asuka's sync ratio tends to fluctuate a lot...

ASUKA:	<ICW> Ritsuko, you're not helping!

CELCIA:	Guys, I can't see!  Where am I going?  Which way is the ejector pad?!

	Yet another comm window opens, with another window opening immediately
after.  The first comm window shows a smiling man with shoulder-length green
hair wearing the uniform of a NERV technician.  The figure in the second comm
window also has a NERV tech uniform, but is very much doll-like in appearance.

CELCIA:	Come on, can't you keep my vision clear?

ALL OTHERS:	<ICW, looking at the new comm windows> Who are you?!

SERAVY:	<ICW> Oh, I'm just a passing-by Eva technician.

ELIZABETH:	<ICW> And I'm his assistant!

GENDO:	<ICW> You know, you two look familliar.

SERAVY:	<ICW> No, we never met before.

CELCIA:	Will you just tell me how to stop this thing?!

SERAVY:	<ICW> Oh, that's easy.  All you have to do is break synchronization
with the Eva unit.  By default, the Eva should deactivate.

CELCIA:	How do I do that?!

ASUKA:	<ICW> Oh, that's easy.  Used to happen to me all the time.  All you
need to do is close your mind to the Eva, and your sync ratio will plunge.

CELCIA:	Okay...

	Celcia closes her eyes and concentrates for a few minutes, then...

SHIGERU:	<ICW> No good.  Sync ratio's holding steady.

MISATO:	<ICW> then we go with the original plan.  Celcia, get the Eva back to
the ejector pad.

CELCIA:	I can't SEE the ejector pad!  All of these communications windows are
open!

	Another window opens with a banner advertisement.  "See hot XXX porn free! 
click here!"

RITSUKO:	<ICW> *sigh* Banner ads.  Great.  Let me close this...

	The window closes, and then klaxons can be overheard through the Comm.
	
MISATO:	<ICW>	What the...

MAKATO:	<ICW>	What's happening?

MAYA:	<ICW> It's the Magi!  They're being overloaded!

MISATO:	<ICW> Oh no...it's one of *those* banner ads!  If you close the window
it opens another twenty!

CELCIA:	WHAT?!

	Suddenly every spare square centimeter of the entry plug's visual field is
covered with miscellaneous banner ads for pornographic sites, stockbroker
sites, MP3 sites, auction sites, more pornographic sites, sites on how to firm
your tomatoes, matchmaker sites, and other such information that seems to
pervade the web.

SERAVY:	<ICW> Oh well, usually my suggestions work.  I guess you're screwed.

	Seravy's and Elizabeth's comm windows close, replaced by an ad for
low-price Anime.

CELCIA:	GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!

	In a panic, Celcia flails in her seat, trying to sweep the banner ads away. 
With her synchronization to the Eva, she grabs the progressive knife.

MAYA:	<ICW> Progressive knife engaged!

RITSUKO:	<ICW> Eject the power cord!

MAKATO:	<ICW> No effect!  The signal's not being recieved!  The banner ads have
crashed the Magi!

MISATO:	<ICW> I told you we should have installed spam-blocking software, but
nooooo...you needed the clock cycles for Seti@home...

	Celcia feels the knife in her grip through the synchronization link, and in
her panic, starts slashing at the banner ads and comm windows.  Translated
through the Eva, these movements take the progressive knife through arcs and
stabs into the ground, and Eva-02 starts digging a very big hole.
	Meanwhile, back in the Entry Theater...
	
SHINJI:	Well, the safest place to be is inside an Eva.  I'm sure she's fine.

>Looking down, he saw his 4 year-old daughter, Yui, hugging him and giving him
>a big smile.

RIIYA:	Wait a minute...wasn't Yui 4 years old in 2005?

AEKA:	Well...it could be the Juraian life water or something.  Funaho is a
convenient source for that.  Or she could have spent some time in cryostasis.  
Sasami and I spent some time drifting on the Ryo-oh in stasis, so she might
look eight even though she's really over seven hundred years old.

RYOKO:	I got it.  Let's call this time discrepancy "The Washu Effect," and not
nitpick over it, okay?

>
>"Hello, daddy!" Yui said.
>
>"What's daddy's little miracle trying to do?  Give him a heart attack?"

LINA:	Two attempted heart attacks since this fic started.  I think Tenchi
needs to lower his blood cholesterol.

>he said, 
>laughing and picking up Yui and holding her in his arms. 
>
>"No, silly daddy!"

SHINJI:	<as Yui> ...Trix are for kids!

>laughed Yui in return. "I just want to say hi! ...Hello dad!"  Yui hugged her
>father tighter, putting her head on his shoulders.
>

AEKA:	Cranial transplant courtesy of Washu.

>"Well, I'm touched," Tenchi said, his smile shining. "Hello to you, too,"  he 
>whispered in her ears, holding Yui tightly in his arms.
>
>Then Yui held her head up, looking into her father's eyes. "Oh!"
>
>"What is it, Yui?" he asked.
>
>"I want to give you something."

LINA:	<as Yui> It's my head!  I decapitated myself just for you, daddy!

RYOKO:	Do I call that perverse or just surreal?

>She reached into her pocket.
>
>"What?  You want to give daddy a gift?"
>
>"Uh huh!" she said affirmatively. "Hold out your hand and close your eyes."
>
>"Alright," he said, following his daughter's instructions.
>
>"No cheating OK?" Yui said, reaching into her pocket.
>
>"Don't worry, I won't," Tenchi reassured her, waiting patiently.
>
>"OK! Open your eyes."
>
>Tenchi complied, and saw a yellow flower in Yui's hand.
>
>"This is for you, dad," Yui said, trying to place the flower onto her father's 
>earlobe.

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi> Gee, thanks, but last I checked, my ears weren't
pierced...

RYOKO:	<as Yui> No problem, I'll just pierce them for you!  *ka-CHONK!*

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi> EEEEYYYAAAHHH!

>
>"Thank you, Yui."  Tenchi leaned his head over to make it easier for Yui to 
>place the flower onto his ear, and she did so.
>
>"Don't thank me," she said.
>
>"What?" Tenchi asked, a little surprised. "Why not?" 
>
>"Because it's mommy's gift to you."
>
>"Oh really?" he said, smiling.
>
>"Uh huh.  And she has a message for you."
>
>"What message?" Tenchi asked curiously.
>
>"Um...let me see..." Yui was thinking hard, trying to remember the set of 
>instructions her mother had given her.

RYOKO:	Yui, if he tries to marry Aeka, kill them both.

AEKA:	HEY!

SHINJI:	Grandma, you wouldn't!

RYOKO:	...and if you meet a man named Gendo, avoid him like the plague!!!

>
>Tenchi waited patiently for a few minutes.
>
>"OH! I remember!" Yui exclaimed. "Mommy wants me to tell you to scream out her 
>name out loud.  Then mom will tell you the message."
>
>"OK," Tenchi said. "You want to help daddy?"
>
>"Um, OK!"
>
>"On three, OK?"
>
>"OK." Yui said, beaming with enthusiasm.
>
>"One... two... 

RIIYA:	FIVE!

LINA:	Three, sir...

>three!" he counted. 

	All of the MSTers blink.
	
AEKA:	The Monty Python bit, ladies and gentlemen.
>
>"MOMMY!" "RYOKO!" they yelled at the same time.

RIIYA:	...Yui yelling "Ryoko" and Tenchi yelling "Mommy..."

>
>Tenchi and Yui waited a few moments.  Tenchi then felt a breeze of air behind 
>him;

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi> Damn burritos.

>he turned around to sees Ryoko standing there smiling at himself and his
>daughter.  Ryoko walked up to Tenchi and Yui, putting her mouth close to 
>Tenchi's 
>right ear and whispering, "I love you, my Tenchi."
>

AEKA:	You...DEMON!  <makes a lunge for Ryoko>

SHINJI:	ACK!

INU-YASHA:	<grabbing Aeka> Listen, Princess, it's a fic!

AEKA:	SIT!

	Inu-Yasha faceplants right on top of Aeka...dropping her right on top of
Shinji.
	
SHINJI:	<muffled> oh that really worked.

	The MSTers return to their seats.

>Tenchi smiled and faced Ryoko. Ryoko turned and looked at him, then gave him 
>a small but sensual kiss on his lips.  Tenchi was still holding Yui in his
>arms; she was staring at them kissing.
>
>"Ooh!" Yui said teasingly. "Shame! Shame! Shame!"
>
>"Oh, you little tease!" Ryoko said, smiling and patting her daughter's head.  
>
>All three of them began to laugh... then everything disappeared but the
flowers.

LINA:	So only the flowers were real, then?

>                                                ***
>
>"Tenchi, are you alright?" Aeka asked,  noticing Tenchi's flower-induced 
>hypnotic trance.

SHINJI:	Damn those hallucinogenic Juraian flowers!

>
>"Huh?"  Tenchi said dumbly,  realizing he was back in the present day. "Oh!  
>Uhh...sorry," he said with a tinge of embarrassment.

INU-YASHA:	<as Tenchi> Was I spontaneously time-travelling again?

RYOKO:	<as Aeka> You were tripping out on flowers.

>
>"It's alright.  No need to apologize,"  Aeka assured him.

SHINJI:	Have they released that episode yet?

>
>Tenchi and Aeka were silent. A few minutes passed by before Aeka decided to 
>speak up.
>
>"It's been 13 years since she died."
>
>"Yes... it has," he said with sadness, trying to repress the memory of the
>last few painful moments he had spent with Ryoko.
>
>Aeka noticed Tenchi's expression. *Great, now I made him sad. I really put my 
>foot in my mouth this time.* Aeka decided to leave him alone for a moment,
>looking down at the engraved gravestone:  
>
>Ryoko Masaki
>Died on the 25th of April in the year 2005

RYOKO:	I finally get Tenchi...so why do I have to be dead?!

SHINJI:	Maybe it's the Captain Kirk effect.

AEKA:	I'm sorry, the what?

SHINJI:	The Captain Kirk effect.  Star Trek.  Every time Captain Kirk and some
woman mutually love each other in a television episode, that woman will
inevitably die.  Since Tenchi's the lead character, when he fell in love with
Ryoko, she was pretty much destined to bite it.

AEKA:	I...see.  So marrying Tenchi would be...

LINA:	A deathtrap.  Correct.

>
>She began thinking about the irony of it all, to see the gravestone placed
>here at the shore of the lake.  This had been the very location where Ryoko
>had taken Tenchi's hand

INU-YASHA:	...using her lightsword.  *slash*

RIIYA:	<as Tenchi> AAAAAARRRRRGGH!

RYOKO:	You know, maybe cutting off appendages could be fun.  <Forms a
lightsword> Let's find out, Inu-Yasha.

>in marriage; several years later, she'd died in his arms here.
> 
>Tenchi picked up the yellow flowers and sniffed them, taking in their aroma.  
>His sad expression disappeared, replaced with a soft smile.

LINA:	Oh Cephied...Tenchi's stoned again.

SHINJI:	Where can I get some of those flowers?

>After a minute, he 
>began to pray with the flowers clasped in his hands.  
>
>Aeka stood there, watching him pray; she admired his devotion for Ryoko. 
>
>***
>

AEKA:	There they are.  Three tiny black flowers.

>Meanwhile, back at the house,  Yui was still staring at herself in the mirror,  
>finding many ways to compare her resemblance to her mother.  She was also 
>thinking about how she resembled her father as well.  

RIIYA:	She doesn't have...male...body parts down there...does she?

>
>*I have the color of her eyes, except they look more human than feline; I have 
>my father's ears, my mother's nose; hmm...I also have her hair color,* Yui 
>thought to herself and smiled.

INU-YASHA:	<as Yui, thinking> And her voluptuous knockers.

RYOKO:	Should I be flattered by that remark, or offended, knowing who it came
from?

>
>"Admiring yourself, Yui?" Sasami asked jokingly, walking into Yui's room.
>
>"Aunt Sasami! I didn't know you were here!" Yui said, turning and running over 
>to Sasami. She gave the blue-haired goddess a big hug.
>
>"Hello, Yui," Sasami said, returning Yui's affection and smiling warmly.

LINA:	The EPA should restrict those smiles.  I think they're contributing to
the greenhouse effect.

>
>"Why didn't you wake me up when you arrived?" Yui asked.
>
>"I was about to, but decided against it," Sasami answered. "Besides, you were 
>sleeping so peacefully."
>
>"Thank you for your consideration," Yui said, her mood changing. "Although I 
>can't say much about the way I woke up." She looked to the floor.
>
>Sasami was puzzled at the last remark, before intuitively figuring out what 
>Yui was talking about.
>
>"Oh... I see," Sasami said. "You had that nightmare again, didn't you?"

AEKA:	<as Yui> It was those Lemons, Sasami!  I'm so scared I'll end up in
one!

>
>Yui nodded yes, still looking down in depression.  Sasami decided to give Yui 
>another hug, her warmth lifting Yui's spirits.  She smiled,  glad that Aunt
>Sasami was here to make her feel better.  What would Yui ever do without her?

INU-YASHA:	Probably what she did anyway.  Marry Gendo and get integrated into
an Evangelion.

SHINJI:	GRANDMA! <Glomps Ryoko>

RYOKO:	Shinji...ack...need air...

RIIYA:	Wow.  Now that's strength.

>
>"OK, let's go have breakfast!" said Sasami. "You know how much I hate it when 
>the food gets cold."
>
>"Sure," Yui said. "I hate it when I see you frown. ...Makes you look older,"  
>she added fiendishly.

LINA:	<as Yui> MWAHAHAHAHA!  Talking about her age...makes me feel eeeeeevil.

>
>"Oh, is that it?" Sasami said loudly. "Well, let's see if you can beat me

INU-YASHA:	<as Sasami> ...with whips and chains like Aeka does.

AEKA:	SIT!

	Inu-yasha...well...does the usual thing.
	
AEKA:	You know, this is too easy.  Hammerspace hasn't seen much use yet with
him around, has it?

RYOKO:	<prying Shinji off enough to breathe> You have no idea.

>
>"OK! Fine, you're on!" Yui said with excitement. *I've never raced her before, 
>hmm... she does run a little slow... I'll beat her

RYOKO:	SIT!

INU-YASHA:	<faceplanting> ACK!  HEY!  I didn't say anything!

RYOKO:	I know.  That was pre-emptive.

>like it was nothing!*

>"Are you ready?" asked Sasami.
>
>"Ready when you are!"

>"On your mark..."

RIIYA:	...by Hayao Miazaki, creator of Princess Mononoke.

>Yui knelt down.

LINA:	...And prayed to Tsunami.

RYOKO:	<as Tsunami> Yui, dear, I'm standing in front of you, you can just tell
me.

>"Get set..."

>Yui was preparing herself mentally.
>
>"And Yui?" 
>
>"Yes?" Yui asked.
>
>"Don't hesitate to use your abilities."

AEKA:	Use the Force, Yui...

RIIYA:	That has got to be an old joke.

AEKA:	But a classic!

>
>"Are you sure?" Yui asked, making sure Sasami wasn't going crazy on her.
>
>Sasami nodded.
>
>*Oh man! I'm really going to beat her

INU-YASHA:	I wasn't going to say anything.

AEKA:	Oh...well, this is too much fun.  SIT!

INU-YASHA:	<faceplanting> You royal pain in the...

>in no time flat!* Yui thought, giddy.
>
>"Alright..." Sasami finished her countdown. "GO!" 
>
>Yui stormed out of her bedroom at lightning speed,

SHINJI:	Isn't storming assosciated with anger and stomping?

RYOKO:	This actually being somewhat of a good fic, I'd say not to nitpick, but
you're right, Shinji.

SHINJI:	Thanks, Grandma.

RYOKO:	DON'T CALL ME GRANDMA!

>*Of course! How could I be so forgetful!* she angrily thought to herself. Yui

RIIYA:	She has the power to stop flying objects.  Wow.

>
>"Hey, not fair!  You're using your omnipotent abilities!"
>

AEKA:	<as Yui> You're as bad as a self-insertion character!

SHINJI:	<as Q> Omnipotent abilities are the only kind of abilities I have.

>The force field around Yui disappeared, setting her free.  She looked at

>
>"Ah, look!  Now who's the one who's frowning and looking out?" Sasami said,

INU-YASHA:	...She failed miserably.  Her finger slipped, and Yui's gut busted,
spilling entrails all over the floor.

RYOKO:	AEKA! GET YOUR DAMN HAND OFF MY TENCHI!

AEKA:	Really, Ryoko!  Tenchi isn't some toy, he is a real person with his own
thoughts and feelings!

RYOKO:	I know that!

AEKA:	Then stop acting like a Shin Tenchi bitch!

fic...

RIIYA:	Yes, but what does she do?

INU-YASHA:	Does she?

>"When is Shoji coming over?"
>
>"Hopefully he'll be here by next Monday."

>"Really!" Tenchi said, excited to see him again.

INU-YASHA:	GAY LEMON!

RYOKO:	Well, the alternative is marrying Aeka...

AEKA:	WHAT DID YOU SAY, DEMON?!

RYOKO:	Now who's acting like a Shin Tenchi bitch?  Geez, princess, I was
actually kidding there.  As much as we are in competition, I'm glad to have a
worthy rival.  I might have had to contend with Sakuya, you know.

AEKA:	<calming down a bit> Well...I suppose.  And this is a fic, after all. 
Oh by the way, Inu-Yasha...

INU-YASHA:	DON'T...

AEKA AND RYOKO:	SIT!

INU-YASHA:	<faceplanting twice as hard> ...say it...

>"Yes," Aeka confirmed.
>
>"Great! I can't wait!  Yui will love to hear this, as soon I can tell her," 
>he said joyously. "She just adores being around him."

AEKA:	First Tenchi, now Shoji!  Why is it every time I get a man, some
demon-girl has her eyes on him too?!

RYOKO:	Just be glad you're still alive.  Tenchi has Captain Kirk syndrome.

RIIYA:	Wait a minute...something's just wrong with that.  Isn't that incest?

INU-YASHA:	Not unless they do it, Riiya.

	Riiya starts looking sick.

RITSUKO:	<ICW> That, and the fact that Shoji and Yui aren't blood-related to
begin with, so they don't have to worry about the effects of inbreeding.  Even
if they were related, some aspect of Juraian genetics filters out the
expression of deleterious recessives assosciated with inbreeding, so if they
did have intercourse...

	Riiya barfs.
	
LINA:	Too much information, Ritsuko.

	At that point, a gigantic vibrating blade punches through the screen from
the back with enough force to not only pierce the Entry Theater and the screen,
but the AT field protecting it.  The LCL empties in a rush, the current
threatening to pull the MSTers out of their seats and into the adjoining space. 
The MSTers except for Riiya hang onto their seats.
	Riiya, meanwhile, is pressed into the back of the theater, his hands on
either side of the gigantic blade giving him a frictional grip good enough to
keep it from cutting him in half.  His werewolf strength, despite being enough
to keep him from being bisected, does not keep him from being embedded in the
back wall under the force of the knife.

RYOKO:	*cough, sputter* What...the hell...is that?!

SHINJI:	<exhaling the LCL from his lungs and coughing> It's a progressive
knife...<recognizing the sectional design of the blade> Eva-02's progressive
knife!

INU-YASHA:	Feh.  Like it compares to the Tetsusaiga.

AEKA:	What timing...when i was just about to give Tenchi some good news.

	A quick cut to Central Dogma...
	
MISATO:	Whew...we got the Magi rebooted just in time to disconnect that power
cord.  Good thing the internal batteries only hold a minute of power.

MAYA:	Eva has stopped activation inside the cage.

RITSUKO:	After she cut a hole right down through all those layers of special
armor with that knife...

ASUKA:	Wow, my Eva did that?

MAYA:	Auto eject sequence activated!

RITSUKO:	NO!  Not in the cage!

	With a grating sound of metal on metal, the knife slides out and Riiya,
with the ultimate sweatdrop on his head, falls out of the hole.

RIIYA:	That was too close...

SHINJI:	You outpowered an Eva?  That's strong.

	A muted explosive pop can be heard from the other side of the entry theater
wall.

LINA:	What was that?

	The entry plug's escape rockets can be heard, as well as the plug
ricocheting around the next room.

RIIYA:	Sounds like a rocket.

RYOKO:	Something's bouncing around out there...

	Ryoko walks over to the very large hole cut by the progressive knife and
looks outside.  She has a split second of the entry plug rocketing towards her
before the plug hits the Entry Theater, tearing the hole wider and smashing
Ryoko into the back wall.

AEKA:	RYOKO!

RIIYA:	This isn't happening...this isn't happening...wait...maybe it's a plot
by the Evil Magic Lord...

SHINJI:	Grandma!  Oh no...GRANDMA!!

RYOKO:	<muffled> I told you... <phase shifting through the Entry Plug's body
and appearing outside> I'm not your grandma.

INU-YASHA:	Then I guess you don't have a daughter named Yui...

RYOKO:	SI...

INU-YASHA:	WAIT!  Ryoko, come on...let's talk about this before you faceplant
me again.

RYOKO:	Give me one reason why.

	Inu-Yasha strides up to Ryoko and whispers in her ear.  Ryoko gets a
thoughtful look on her face.

RYOKO:	You've got me intrigued.  Let's talk about this later.

LINA:	Um...aren't we forgetting about someone?

RYOKO:	Who?

AEKA:	<suddenly realizing> CELCIA!

	Later, in Central Dogma, in the Eva control block, just below the command
station of the Supreme Commander...
	The MSTers, having showered, are all assembled, still wearing the plug
suits.

RYOKO:	Okay...what gives?  This fic is well-written, it actually involves some
character development, it's actually good!  WHY are we MSTing it?

MISATO:	I'm sure the readers have been asking themselves that same question
since they started.  Ritsuko, would you please clarify?

RITSUKO:	The fact that a piece of work is good does not necessarily mean it
cannot be made light of, heckled, jibed at, or in our case, MSTed.  Though
generally poor-quality works are typical MST targets, the heckling of good
works has been the province of periodicals such as Mad Magazine.

AEKA:	That still doesn't mean we're not going to get flamed for this.

MISATO:	The only thing that we've had a complaint about thus far from the
higher-ups is a percieved defamation of Rei Ayanami.

SHINJI:	But Rei hasn't even been in the Entry Theater!

RITSUKO:	Maya, review the last mission log.

MAYA:	Yes, Sempai.

	One of the screens clears, displaying the interior of the Entry Theater.
	
>SHINJI:	From being more cocky than Asuka to having less emotion than Rei.
>All he needs is more angst than me and he can pilot all 3 Evas.

SHINJI:	Well it's true!  Rei hardly shows any emotion except to my dad!

MISATO:	Then there was that remark about the way she keeps blowing herself up.

SHINJI:	That's also true!  The first time she tried to take out an angel with a
kamikaze trip and an N2 mine!  The second time...she self-destructed her own
Eva to destroy another Angel!

MISATO:	Well...I guess you're right.

GENDO:	Captain Katsuragi, please get to the relevant issue.

MISATO:	Oh yes.  Well, the entry theater has been severely damaged.

RYOKO:	No shit.

MISATO:	At any rate, we will have to finish the experiment with some other
means.

LINA:	Can't you give us a break?

RITSUKO:	Lina, you will be getting some relief from the Entry Theater.  We
need to make an exchange of crew members.  You will be engaging unit 02
directly in combat.

LINA:	What?

RITSUKO:	We need to gather data on your magical abilities.  In order to do
that, we need to run some tests.  We will need you to engage Asuka in unit 02.

LINA:	And I get to use my magic?

RITSUKO:	We would prefer if you did.  We will have Tokyo-3 in battle
formation, so you will be able to use your full gamut of spells, providing, of
course, they won't give us a Fifth Impact.

LINA:	Damn.  Guess no Giga Slave, then.  All right.  Bring her on.

RITSUKO:	In order to fill out the sixth seat and establish parameters that
are close to our baseline, we will be doing a dual exchange.  We have decided
to send Inu-Yasha back to where he came from.

INU-YASHA:	ALL RIGHT!  Those Shikon Jewel shards are as good as mine!

AEKA:	Wait...WHY HIM?!

RITSUKO:	He's too much of a liability.  The investigation of the damage to
the Entry Theater revealed several dents in the floor from repeated impacts.

RYOKO AND AEKA:	Eh...heh heh...

RITSUKO:	So, filling our fifth seat will be a veteran to the crew.

	Enter Harry Potter, the young wizard-in-training, famed for overthrowing
the most powerful dark wizard of his world.  His robes, however, look like
they're made in a sort of Eva motif.

RITSUKO:	Welcome back Harry Potter, everyone.  Harry, do the plug robes fit?

INU-YASHA:	Just what we need...another kid.

SHINJI:	What's that supposed to mean?

INU-YASHA:	Nothing personal.  Not every fourteen-year-old can boast the track
record of saving the world all the time, taking phenomenal abuse, and on top of
that, being forced to do it by his own father.

HARRY:	Well, being here is still better than...<shudder>

RYOKO:	What happened?

HARRY:	Ritsuko misjudged the causality hole's transport accuracy, and it sent
me into "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."  I had to endure Gilderoy
Lockhart AGAIN.

RYOKO:	Who?

HARRY:	Um...let me think...annoyance factor of Naga squared.

	Lina shudders.
	
AEKA:	Well, now that we have our fifth person, who's filling in the sixth
seat?

MISATO:	Well...we had to contract out for this one.

	In a column of light, Washu appears, her subspace computer conveniently at
her fingertips.

WASHU:	Hi, everyone!

RYOKO:	MOM?!  You're MSTing this one too?

WASHU:	I'm not wearing any plug suit, sweetie.  Actually I'm here to fill you
in on your partner.  See, NERV actually contracted my aid in helping to bring
back an old friend.

SHINJI:	Rei?

WASHU:	Well...I'm working on that.  A very good guess, though.  You see, with
the influence of the causality hole, things not directly within my influence
can be slightly affected.  So in order to avoid adverse affects in the
regeneration, I had to take the reconstruction in stages.  I would like to
present the intermediate stage of Rei version 4.0...

	A few keystrokes, and a holographic screen appears, upon which is seen the
growth tank in Central Dogma.  Within the orange liquid is...

WASHU:	I give you...Rei-ohki!

	Practically everyone in Central Dogma, except for Gendo, Fuyutski, and
Washu, facefault.
	The figure looks like a nude Rei, but she has fuzzy ears which stick out
from the sides of her head, a la Merle from Escaflowne.  In her forehead is a
small red oval gem.

RYOKO:	Rei...OHKI?

SHINJI:	What did you DO to her?!

WASHU:	I simply regrew her genetic material using some existing backup tissue
cultures I had in the lab, a little manipulation of basic cellular matter, and
the gracious use of NERV's lab facilities.

RYOKO:	Uh...*why?!*

WASHU:	Ryoko, trying to work across causality interference is quite difficult. 
One slip-up and you would have had to deal with Rei-oko!

RYOKO:	<pause> You have a point.

	The holographic screen clears.
	
GENDO:	Thank you, Dr. Washu.

WASHU:	Oh please, call me "Little Washuu!"

GENDO:	We will have to deal with the situation and set up a temporary theater.

SERAVY:	I have an idea.  Why not use the main control center?

	Right next to Gendo, in exactly the same pensive pose, is a
familliar-looking man with shoulder-length green hair.  He is wearing the exact
same clothes as Gendo, right down to the glasses.  Next to him is a doll
wearing the same clothes as Fuyutski, but scaled to fit.

SERAVY:	You have everything you need to perform the experiment right here.  The
big main display will serve very well as the screen, and the audio outputs can
be modified to produce the greatest surround-sound effect.  As for LCL, I'm
sure Dr. Akagi can either fill this place or come up with a substitute to
compensate for any disturbances in the measurements.

	There is a moment of silence, then Gendo's eyes flicker to his
doppleganger.

GENDO:	Just who the hell are you?

SERAVY:	Oh, I'm just a passing-by Supreme Commander of NERV.

ELIZABETH:	And I'm his subordinate.

SERAVY:	In the meantime, why don't you take an hour break so everyone here can
set up the control room for you.  You can get acquainted and bring yourselves
up to date.

WASHU:	Well, I guess my work here is done...bye!

RYOKO:	NO!  MOM!  WAIT!  GET ME OUT OF THIS...

	Washu disappears in a column of light.  Seravy is similarly gone in a puff
of smoke along with Elizabeth.

GENDO:	Fuyutski.

FUYUTSKI:	Yes, commander?

GENDO:	That person who was up here seemed very familliar.   I want him killed.

RYOKO:	Okay, dog-boy, my mom just left me to fend for myself here, and I'm not
too happy.  Before you go back to wherever you came from, tell me how I can
make the best of Shinji's mistaken identity problem!

	A few minutes later, in the elevator...
	
RYOKO:	Okay, start talking.

INU-YASHA:	It's so simple, Ryoko.  I'm surprised you haven't hit upon it. 
Think about this.  The fic describes your daughter as being named "Yui," and
there has been a lot of Evangelion references early on.  Yui.  Misato.  Kaji. 
That would imply a very interesting parallel.

RYOKO:	We've been through that.  So what?

INU-YASHA:	Will you think about it?  It means your son-in-law is Supreme
Commander of NERV!  Given Japanese cultural customs...you're looking at a
helluva lot of perks!  And all you have to do is humor the kid!  Think of what
that'll do for your standing with Tenchi...that you now have access to a
multitrillion-dollar organization!

RYOKO:	<smiling> Hmmmm...

	An hour later, in the briefing room...
	
SHINJI:	And that's basically the whole story.

HARRY:	So let me get this straight.  Ryoko's your grandma?  Wow.  And I
thought I was the only kid who had an infamous criminal for a relative. 
'Course my relative was innocent, but...

SHINJI:	It just sounds kinda contrived.

RIIYA:	Well that would be the MST author's fault, but he's allowed to do that. 
I dunno, what do you think, Rei?

REI:	<deadpan> Miya.

RIIYA:	Never mind.

SHINJI:	Oh Rei, what have they done, reducing you to a one-word vocabulary...

REI:	I can still speak, you know.

SHINJI:	Rei!  That's wonderful!

REI:	Hai.

	Enter Gendo, followed by Fuyutski.  Gendo takes a seat.
	
GENDO:	Now that we are all assembled...where's Ryoko?

	Ryoko emerges through the floor, right next to Gendo.
	
RYOKO:	Here I am, son-in-law.

GENDO:	...Son-in-law?

RYOKO:	Didn't you expect this when you married Yui?  Haven't you followed the
fic?  Yui's my daughter.

AEKA:	Ryoko, what are you...

RYOKO:	Oh princess, isn't it wonderful?  I have a son-in-law!

AEKA:	What are you up to, you...demon?!

RYOKO:	Oh come now, Aeka...I have family to consider.

GENDO:	Return to first stage alert.  All of you, into central control.

SHINJI:	Here we go again...

	The MSTers assemble in central control, roughly in front of the 3 Magi. 
There are seats already set up for them, and a sizeable cooler of...

HARRY:	...beer?  Carrots?

RITSUKO:	<ICW on one of the consoles> It's the closest thing we had on hand
to LCL.  And we don't have enough time to waterproof every console in the
place.  We'll be working to fix the Entry Theater as soon as possible.

SHINJI:	But we're all underage!

MISATO:	Shinji, you're an Eva pilot, and this is by order of NERV.  Drink up.

SHINJI:	Oh boy...

	The MSTers take their seats.  The seating order is...Ryoko,
Shinji, Rei, Harry, Aeka, Riiya.

AEKA:	Well, we can see what happened to me before we were so rudely
interrupted by Eva-02.

MISATO:	LAUNCH!

	At the same time, two catapaults fire, one carrying Eva-02, the other
carrying...

LINA:	EEEEYYYAAAHHHHH!!!!

	And the fic resumes.

>pregnant."

	There is a moment of silence from the MSTers as this sinks in.
	
SHINJI:	Well, I guess I should say...congratulations, Great-Aunt Aeka!

AEKA:	Pickles!  Ice cream!  I need pickles and ice cream!  And carrots! 
Dammit, Ryo-ohki, I need those!

REI:	Miya.  Over my dead bodies.

	(Author's note: that waS NOT a typo.)

RYOKO:	<sigh> Okay, princess, before you get too much into this fic too, I
might as well tell you what I'm up to.  Meantime, have a beer.

	Ryoko glides over to Aeka, puts a can of Sapporo in her hands, and whispers
in her ear.

AEKA:	<eyes wide> Oh my...so you're doing this to...

RYOKO:	Uh huh.

AEKA:	Well...I suppose it's okay.

>
>"What?! Really?! Wow!" Tenchi exclaimed. "Congratulations, Aeka!"
>
>"Thank you, Tenchi."
>
>"So how long have you been pregnant?" he asked.

RIIYA:	<as Aeka> Six months.  I have a very thin fetus.  <Shifts wolf with a
*pop,* bounds to the cooler, and snags a beer before jumping to his seat and
shifting back to human>.

HARRY:	Nice trick. <Opens a beer>

>
>"About a month and a half now.  I wanted tell you personally, but Shoji wanted 
>me to wait until he arrived.  He wanted to be here to share in on the 
>celebration."
>
>"Don't worry; your secret is safe with me," he assured her.

HARRY:	Two days later, an article appears in the National Enquirer.

REI:	<as Enquirer> First princess of Jurai pregnant with alien child!  Also
the exclusive on the princess-pirate-pauper love triangle!

>
>"Thank you, Tenchi."
>
>"I knew you were putting on a little bit of weight," he added mischievously.
>
>"What?!  Am I already getting large?" she exclaimed, checking her figure.

RYOKO:	<Finishing a beer and going for another> Heh heh heh...

AEKA:	And just what does that imply, Ryoko?

>
>"Just kidding," Tenchi said, smiling. Aeka returned the same.
>
>Tenchi and Aeka eventually reached the house; Yui noticed Aeka walking through 
>the doorway.
>
>"Aunt Aeka!" greeted Yui, walking over to Aeka and hugging her.
>
>"How are you doing, Yui?" asked Aeka.
>
>"I'm doing fine," Yui said, "and yourself?"
>
>"I'm fit and healthy."

REI:	<as Aeka> With the exception of the yeast infection and the Juraian
flu...oh yeah, and there might be a case of hemorragic fever going around...

SHINJI:	Rei, have another beer?

REI:	Hai.

>
>"Come on! Let's eat!" Yui said with excitement,  walking over to the table.  
>Sasami was already eating her bowl of rice; Ryo-ohki was eating her carrots in 
>humanoid form.  Aeka sat down next to Yui; Tenchi sat down next to Ryo-ohki. 

HARRY:	<as S.A.T.> Given this information, what is the most probable seating
order? a) Aeka, Tenchi, Ryo-Ohki, Sasami, Yui; b) Aeka, Yui, Tenchi, Ryo-ohki,
Sasami; c) Tenchi, Aeka, Yui, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki; d) Tenchi, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki,
Yui, Aeka; or e) not enough information given to solve this problem?

>
>"Your father tells me that you were doing very well at practice yesterday," 
>said Aeka.
>
>"Oh... he did, did he?" Yui said, smiling at her father.
>
>"He also said that you almost got the upper hand over him."
>
>"Well..." Yui said, trying to be modest. "I didn't exactly - you know he still 
>has the advantage..."

RIIYA:	He's the damn title character!  He *would* have the advantage!

RYOKO:	Wow.  You get slightly agressive when you get drunk, don't you?

RIIYA:	I ain't agressive, biatch!

>Yui was cut off by her father.
>
>"On the contrary, Yui," Tenchi said with pride. "I think you've learned almost 
>everything you need to learn.  Now all you have to do is master 

REI:	<as Tenchi> ...bait.  <snicker>

SHINJI:	Rei?!

AEKA:	Er...well...she does have emotions after all.

SHINJI:	Yep, just got to looshen her up a bit...heh heh heh...

RYOKO:	Rei, shit.  I mean SIT.

AEKA:	Five beers, Ryoko...maybe you better slow down.

SHINJI:	She's not Inu-Yasha, grandma.

RYOKO:	Schorry, forgot.

RIIYA:	DAMMIT, SHINJI, DON'T CALL HER GRANDMA!

RYOKO:	Riiya, I am!

RIIYA:	Damn you Ryoko!  Now you tell me...*hic*

>your 
>techniques!"  
>
>"But, dad!" Yui began, trying to head off her father's next statement. *I
>better think of something to say, before he makes his speech; I better stop
>him before...*  Yui was too late. "Oh no," she whispered to herself.

HARRY:	<as Tenchi> Never in the field of human conflict, have so many, spent
so much, for so few.

RIIYA:	<ditto> Working men of the world, Untie!

SHINJI:	<ditto> four score and seven years ago...

REI:	<as Tenchi> Give me liberty or give me another beer...

>
>"Ever since she was 6, I've trained her to be the best sword fighter!  She 
>learned things faster than I ever did, when I was young!" Tenchi said,
>standing up and curling his fist into a ball. Tears of joy streamed down his
>cheeks. "Now, 11 years later, she almost bested me!

RIIYA:	<as Jinnai> Damn you Mizuhara!  Damn you and your one-upmanship!

>She's grown quicker and stronger! Nobody will ever be able to beat her now!
>You're going to be the greatest and bravest sword fighter of all time!  I'm so
>proud of you, Yui!  SO PROOUD!" he finished with a yell.

SHINJI:	<now noticably tipsy> Would thatsh be a Shoun Tendo moment?

AEKA:	Maybe it's more of a Genma Saotome moment, because Yui is Tenchi's
daughter.

HARRY:	Whoa.  Feeling slightly off here...maybe I oughta slow down.

REI:	That would be the beer.

>
>Tenchi exhaled and looked at everybody sitting at the table.  Yui held her
>face in her hands,

RIIYA:	OH FUCK!  She cut off her face?!  <chugs a beer to drive that image
away>

>extremely embarrassed.  Everybody else had stopped eating,
>staring at Tenchi wide-eyed; beads of sweat loomed on their heads.   
>
>"What?" he asked. "Why's everybody looking at me like that?"

RYOKO:	Honey, you're having Shin flashbacksh again.  <downs another beer>

AEKA:	Ryoko, that's quite enough!

RYOKO:	Hey, Prinschesch, lighten up!  It'sh party time and NERV'sh buying! 
*hic*

>Tenchi heard Yui sigh in the background; 

SHINJI:	So how does an Eva sigh?

YUI:	<ICW, Eva-01: Sound only> *sigh* like that, son.

	All the MSTers stop and stare at the screen.
	
HARRY:	That wash just plain wierd.  *hic*

>he cleared his throat and decided to change the subject. 
>"By the way, your uncle Shoji is going to come by and visit."
>
>"Really?! Uncle Shoji? When?" Yui replied, looking up at her father with great 
>enthusiasm.
>
>"I think he'll arrive on Monday."

AEKA:	...Traffic permitting, of course.  I spent a good fifty years in a
backup along the Intersystem once.  Someone spilled paint on the starlanes.

>
>"Alright!" Yui exclaimed. "I can't wait!  It's been 2 years since the last
>time he came by to visit.  I wonder if he's interested in seeing me practice? 
>He'll be so amazed to see my new abilities!"
>
>"Abilities? What new abilities?" Aeka asked Yui, bemused.

RYOKO:	<flushed, flying over and grabbing Aeka by the front of her plug suit>
Are you making fun of my daughter, bitch?!

AEKA:	Ryoko, I think he said *bemused* as in confused or bewildered, not
*amused,* or something like that.

RYOKO:	<dropping Aeka> Oh...shorry.  <flops back in her seat>

AEKA:	Wow, touchy when drunk, aren't we?

>
>"You mean Dad didn't tell you?" Yui said to Aeka, giving Tenchi a curious
>look.  Aeka nodded no.

REI:	Just how the hell do you nod your head "no?"

HARRY:	I don't think it's atomic...anomic...catanamoic...physhically possible.

>
>"Well, I was thinking that it would be better if you told your aunt first." 
>Tenchi said to Yui. 
>
>"Oh," Yui said, understanding what her father meant.  She looked over to Aeka 
>and the group around the table,  outstretching her hand in a showy way. "Well, 
>here it is!"

SHINJI:	<as Yui> It'sh dad on a plate of Shashimi!

RYOKO:	Shinji, uh...Newjersey declared that joke officially old a long time
ago.

SHINJI:	Eh, the lancsh of Longinuss is older than that joke and we still use
that from time to time...

RYOKO:	Doesn't matter...*hic* I need another beer...

RIIYA:	Who gives a shit!  It's funny!  BWAHAHAHAHA!

>She formed a blue energy ball on her hands, then turned it into
>an energy sword.
>

REI:	...which promptly skewered Yosho through the forehead.

HARRY:	<as Yui> Oops...sorry, great-grandpa.  *hic*

>"Oh my! You can form your own energy sword!" Aeka said with amazement. "That's 
>really interesting... like mother, like daughter."
>
>"You really think so?" asked Yui.
>
>Aeka nodded.
>
>"Well, why not? I guess I really am turning out like mother!" Yui said
>happily.

AEKA:	<as Yui> I'm gonna be a pirate slut just like her!

RYOKO:	<forming a lightsword> What'd you say?!

AEKA:	Slipped out.  Sorry.

> 
>"Maybe you can ask Shoji to practice with you," suggested Aeka.
>
>"Gee, you think he'll be willing enough to volunteer?" Yui asked with a glint
>in her eye.
>
>"I'm sure he's willing, Yui," replied Aeka with a smile. "After all, Shoji
>used to serve

RYOKO:	<as Aeka> ...burgers at a local Denny's.

AEKA:	What?!

RYOKO:	We're square for the "pirate slut" crack.

SHINJI:	Rei, pash me another beer, will ya?

REI:	<handing a beer to Shinji> Hai.  You shouldn't drink so much.

SHINJI:	Fuck you, Rei, thish ish for shience!  I'm helpin' Ritshuko test the
Heineken Unshertainty Prinshiple!

REI:	*hic* that's *Heisenberg* Uncertainty Principle.

SHINJI:	No, it's *Heineken!* "Pash me another, it'll be different!"

>as a Juraian Royal Knight."
>
>"I'll ask him as soon as he arrives," Yui said, proceeding to eat up her rice 
>bowl.
>

RIIYA:	*hic* Damn!  She really goes through that porcelain, doesn't she?

>Washu walked out of her lab, tightly closing the door for the last time, and 
>sat down next to Sasami.  The blue-haired goddess looked to Washu and smiled.
>
>"Changed your mind?" Sasami asked.
>
>"Yep,"  Washu said, picking up her bowl of rice and tearing into it. "I
>realized that I haven't eaten a thing in 2 weeks!"

HARRY:	<spewing beer> Two weeks?!  Damn, even Hermione wouldn't go without
food for two weeks!  Can't she use her laptop and program some take-out into
the lab or something?

>
>"You have got to be kidding!" Yui said with concern. "What have you been doing 
>in that lab??"  
>
>"Yes, Washu. Please tell us," Tenchi continued. "What have you been doing 
>in there for the past 13 years?"

SHINJI:	<as Washu> Playing EverQuest.

RYOKO:	<ditto> Plotting ways to get a sample out of Tenchi.

RIIYA:	<ditto> Plotting how to take over the damn world!

REI:	<ditto> Making an erotic torture chamber.

	Ryoko charges up an energy bolt, fires, misses, and hits Harry.
	
HARRY:	Oww...

RYOKO:	Whoops!  Heh heh heh...

	Ryoko charges and fires again, this time hitting Rei.
	
REI:	Miya-ouch.  <Munches a charred carrot while she obtains a new beer to
replace the shredded and mangled can>  *hic*

>
>"Let me finish eating, will ya!" Washu barked out between bites . "I'll tell
>all of you as soon as I stop starving!"

RIIYA:	Washu's a fuckin' anorexic?!  Ye gads, get some food in her!!!

HARRY:	Shuch language...do you always get like this when you're *hic* drunk?

RIIYA:	Lay the hell off, Pothead, I've only been drunk twice!

HARRY:	Twice?!

RIIYA:	Episode 6 of Chacha, and right now.

>
>"Does this mean that we'll be finally be able to go in to your lab?" Yui asked 
>Washu, trepidation and excitement mixed in her voice.
>
>Washu nodded yes, continuing to demolish her rice bowl.  She was quiet and had
>a slight looked of concern on her face. 

AEKA:	<as Washu> I think I spilled a vial of plutonium...maybe I should tell
them to wear closed-toed shoes in the lab instead of sandals.

>
>"Oh, wow! This is going to be interesting!" exclaimed Yui. "I've never stepped 
>into your lab before!" Yui smiled, her anticipation growing. "I wonder what's 
>inside it?" 
>
>Tenchi observed his daughter's growing anticipation.  Yui's desire to enter
>Washu's lab brought back memories of himself exploring Ryoko's cave

RIIYA:	Boy, did he ever!  BWAHAHAHAHA!

RYOKO:	Well, that's how Yui was concieved...

>when he
>was younger.  Like her father, Yui was forbidden from stepping inside the lab;

RYOKO:	That's a firsht.  I thought mom had more trouble trying to get him INTO
the lab.

>like her father, she was curious.
>
>*Like father, like daughter,* Tenchi thought to himself, sipping his tea.  
>
>While Yui continued to grow excited,

	Riiya and Shinji start snickering.
	
RYOKO:	I'm gonna blast the two of you as soon as I figure out which two out of
the eight I'm seeing you really are...

AEKA:	Allow me.  <clutches her headband, calling her shield units, which
surround and zap Riiya and Shinji>

RYOKO:	Thanksh...hey, how come your shtill shober?  Oh right...you *can* put
that shtuff away.

>Sasami and Ryo-ohki observed her with 
>great concern.  
>
>Half an hour later, after Washu had finished eating, everybody gathered in 
>front of the once-closet door.  Washu opened the door carefully, allowing the
>group to walk in.  Being her first time in here, Yui was amazed to see the
>huge open spaces of Washu's lab.  *How can something so big possibly fit in a
>space so small?*

RYOKO:	<giggle> That's a shecret between me and Tenchi.

REI:	In that cashe, shouldn't it be, how could something so shmall fit in a
shpace so...

	Ryoko fires off a barrage of energy bolts.  When the smoke clears, there
are a bunch of blast marks around where Rei was sitting.  Rei appears
unscathed.

REI:	Eep.  *hic*

>Yui wandered off to explore the lab, Aeka close in tow.
>
>"It's so amazing! What do you think of it, Aunt Aeka?"
>
>"It's amazing, although it's not the first time I've been in here."  
>
>"That's right!" Yui said in realization. "I was so excited to be here that I 
>almost forgot that you used to come here before I was even born!"

HARRY:	<as Washu> Yep, I couldn't get the sample from Tenchi, so I tried Aeka.

	Aeka punches Harry across the jaw.

HARRY:	<dazed> oooh...pretty snitches... <starts grabbing at the air>

>Yui looked
>at 
>a huge tank to her side; a giant alien whale swam inside it.  Aeka looked over 
>across the room to sees Tenchi walking towards a black cylinder.
>
>To Tenchi, the lab still looked the same 13 years after he'd last set foot in

RIIYA:	...requisite tentacle-demon-like-machine.

SHINJI, HARRY, RYOKO:	KYYYYAAAAAAHHH!!! KANASHII NO IMI!

REI:	Miya?

RYOKO:	Another beer...I need another beer...

AEKA:	What?

HARRY:	Kanashii no Imi was the firsht fic we ever did.  It featured a
"requisite tentacle-demon-like-machine."  I need another beer too...oh
boy...more alcohol...

SHINJI:	I mustn't stay sober...I mustn't stay sober...I mustn't stay sober...

>glass tubes; there
>was really only one difference: a black glass cylinder in the center of the
>lab.

AEKA:	<as Washu> Makes a great convershation piece, doesn't it?

	Ryoko looks at Aeka, finally seeing that the alcohol has started to affect
her.  Then she looks at the cooler.

RYOKO:	Hey, how many of those have you had?

AEKA:	I dunno...I lost count at about number twelve.  *hic*

WASHU:	<ICW> Ah, no problem, I can resupply you.

	A few keystrokes on Washu's holotop, and the cooler is refilled with beer,
carrots, and ice to keep both cool.

>It had several computers and monitoring systems attached to it, the contents 
>hidden due to the glass being black, obscuring its contents. He didn't
>remember it, and was compelled to get closer to it for some reason he couldn't

RIIYA:	<as Washu> Now, Sasami!  Grab him!  That sample will be *mine!*

>
>"Washu, what's in this cylinder? A new invention?" asked Tenchi.
>

LINA:	<as Washu as Xelloss> Sore wa himitsu desu.

>"Not exactly," said Washu. She pushed a sequence of buttons on the cylinder's 
>control board.
>
>Yui was still looking at the alien whale, baffled to see something so huge
>kept inside a small tank yet remain so happy.

RYOKO:	Well Tenchi'sh shorts are kinda small yet...

AEKA:	DON'T finish that thought, Ryoko!  *hic*

>Aeka was still by Yui's side;
>however, the Juraian empress was monitoring the activity across the room. *I

bom bom bom... o/~

>Sensing the need to be there, she

SHINJI:	...and ripped it clean off!

REI:	Miya.  <as Yui> Eh, I'll just regenerate it later.

AEKA:	Wow...I'm really quite a disarming character!

	Ryoko, drunk enough to laugh at this pun, does so and tips backwards off
her seat, hitting the floor behind her with a thud.

HARRY:	Ryoko?  You okay?

RYOKO:	Ah...spilled m'beer...

>
>"What is it, Aunt Aeka?" Yui asked, turning to face her.
>
>"Let's go over there; we need to see why they're all gathered around that

>
>"Alright," Yui said.  They began walking towards the black cylinder where 
>Tenchi, Washu, Sasami, and Ryo-ohki were standing.

REI:	Miya.  <as Tenchi> Hey, check it out, we're all evolving!

GENDO:	<offstage> Fuyutski.  Maybe we've been going at this artificial
evolution thing all wrong.

>Washu was entering some more commands into the control panel when she noticed

REI:	<as Washu> We think we might be able to use you to jumpstart Noboyuki's
car.

AEKA:	<ditto>	Tell me whether you think this tube is half full or half empty.

RIIYA:	<ditto> You may or may not be pregnant.

RYOKO:	<stares at Riiya for a moment> I really don't want to know...

>A familiar woman floated in the tube,

SHINJI:	It's Rei!  *hic*  Hi, Rei!

Ryoko's lap.

SHINJI:	Sorry gramma...

RYOKO:	S'alright.

AEKA:	That usually happens in shtasis...

>"M-mother?" Yui's shock was the greatest; never in her life had she ever

RIIYA:	Oh boy...water metaphors...excess of beer...I gotta piss...

SHINJI:	Just go in the plug suit.  *hic*

RIIYA:	Wha?!

SHINJI:	The plug shuit.

HARRY:	Shinji, you're not wearing a nappy under there, are you?

SHINJI:	Harry, the suit has a waste elimination system and micro-recycler for
prolonged sorties.  You think NERV wouldn't think about something like that?

RYOKO:	Jimmy Hoffa.

AEKA:	Disco.

>Tenchi just stared at Ryoko, having no idea how to react. Could he be
>overjoyed that he was looking upon his wife's beautiful visage once more... 

AEKA:	BUCKET!

RIIYA:	DAMN, Aeka, that wasn't even going anywhere!

	Aeka runs over to the row of consoles, leans over the edge to the vertical
drop to the floor below, and vomits.

HARRY:	Well, thatsh convenient...*hic*

>and still be upset with Washu?
>
>"Is this the real Ryoko?" he asked after an uneasy pause. "...Or is she a

>
>"She's the real Ryoko; the genuine article," answered Washu as neutrally as
>she could.

REI:	<as Washu> Did you think I'd give you a Radio Shack knockoff?

HARRY:	That's kind of a reach, Rei.

REI:	Miya.  *hic*  <slumps over>

>Tenchi's voice turned serious. "Washu... how long have you had Ryoko here?"
>
>"Since the day she died."
>
>Those words caused Tenchi's temper to break. "You mean to tell me that you've 
>been working on her for the past 13 years,  and didn't bother to tell me or 
>anybody else! Not to mention the fact that we performed a sacred funeral for
>her and her body wasn't even present!"

RYOKO:	<as Tenchi> I HATE it when that happens!  I work all this time for a
funeral and the deceased doesn't even bother to show up!

>Hearing her father's yelling, Yui took her attention from the glass tube's

SHINJI:	Blame dad.

REI:	Blame Xelloss.

HARRY:	<singing> o/~ Blame Canada!  Blame Canada! o/~

>up all of Yui's mind as she listened.
>
>"Let me explain myself to you clearly, Tenchi; it won't do either of us any
>good if you scold me further," interrupted Washu. 
>
>"Fine... go ahead. This had better be good." Tenchi was visibly strained in
>his effort to keep himself calm.

>Washu's voice was assuring yet stern. "I always have my reasons, Tenchi.

AEKA:	<as Washu> The most obvious being that I'm the most genius scientist in
the universe!

>rarely make my decisions out of pure emotion. ...The very moment that Ryoko 
>died, I had to switch her body with a double and instantaneously place her
>here in the this unit."
>
>"Why?"
>
>"Because of the residual energy that was left by Onimaru's sword.  If she was 
>ever buried here on Earth, without my intervention, there could've been a 
>worldwide catastrophe."

SHINJI:	Aw, not another Impact! <Downs another beer>

>Washu's expression turned intensely grim for a moment.
>"The dark matter radiation left on Ryoko's wounds was concentrated enough to 
>burst into massive fallout."
>
>"Then why wasn't I affected by this radiation?  I was the closest person to
>her.  In fact, she was in my arms!" Tenchi retorted, his anger bubbling for a
>moment.

RYOKO:	Then it dropped to a gentle shimmer with shtirring.  Washu added
parshley and sherved on fresh pashta.  Tenchi's anger.  Sherves four.

>
>"Because at that time, she was still alive." 
>
>"You mean she was turned into a time bomb?" he asked.

SHINJI:	Tenchi, where have you been?  Women are time bombsh once a month!

>
>"In a manner of speaking, yes, she was.  Ryoko was used by Onimaru as her

REI:	...in the event that Tenshi ni Narumon failed...

>If she'd died 
>before I'd done something... every biological organism on this planet would be

HARRY:	Damn, check it out!  Earth Girl Ryoko!

>
>"OK, OK, we get what you're saying!" Yui interjected, deciding to resolve one
>of her questions. "Then why the big secret?  Why did it take you so long to
>finally tell this to us?"

RYOKO:	This is Washu...she doesh'nt do short explanations...*hic*

>
>" 'Why the big secret'? Allow me to explain. I wanted absolutely no risks at
>all that would hinder Ryoko's regeneration.  The moment I teleported Ryoko
>into this unit, her body exploded."

	The MSTers blink.
	
RIIYA:	Daaaaaamn...she went out with a bang, didn't sh...<gets blasted by
Ryoko>

RYOKO:	That was the worsht pun I've heard!  <crying>

REI:	Miya.  *hic*

>
>"E-exploded?" Yui shivered, not liking the mental picture of that description.

RYOKO:	I don't like it either!

SHINJI:	<downing beers rapid-fire> I mustn't say sober...<chug>...I mustn't
stay sober...<chug>...

>
>"I'm sorry to frighten you, Yui. I'm laying down the facts to you straight."
>
>"It's alright, Washu." Yui said, clearing her mind. "I understand; I should've 
>expected an answer like that sooner.  Please continue."
>
>"When Ryoko's body exploded, it was reduced to atomic particles," continued
>Washu without a break. "I could've regenerated her body within 2 weeks,

REI:	<as Washu> But then Everquest came out with a new expansion so I just
*had* to try it.

RIIYA:	Dark matter?  Hell, Washu's uninstalling Windows from Ryoko!

>It required a lot of patience and a *lot* of peace and

>"But Washu, why weren't we allowed into the lab?" said Yui, satisfied that her

>
>"This unit's parts are so delicate that even a few decibels of sound waves can

AEKA:	<as Washu> And then I'd have to start all over again by sacrificing
Sasami to Cthulhu and it's such a pain to clean all that up.  Oh don't worry,
Tsunami keeps bringing her back.

SHINJI:	The "Kenny Effect," ladiesh and gentlemen.  *hic*

>I'm the only one here with enough physical discipline
>to slow my heart and breathing rate to the lowest possible working conditions.

RYOKO:	Oh, that's fair, mom, and Yosho, the disciplined Shinto priest, can't?

>That is why I had to lock everybody out of the lab and why I've kept silent
>for the last 13 years. If I told anyone, you probably would have tried to get

HARRY:	<as Washu> ...my pants...

	Ryoko runs to the railing and pukes again.

>Washu paused. "...lost Ryoko at an atomic level.

>"Only 2 weeks ago, the machine was able to expel the last of the dark matter

AEKA:	<as Washu> Hmmm...but the machine's components are
sound-sensitive...and she's not completely regenerated yet...that would
mean...oh dear.

>
>"What is Ryoko's status right now?" Tenchi asked, calm and collected now that
>he had heard Washu's response.
>
>"She's 97% fully restored." 
>
>"What happens after she's fully restored?"

REI:	<as Washu> You know, I really haven't thought that far ahead...I don't
know, wanna find out?

>
>"W-ell, even though she will be restored, she isn't quite FULLY restored yet." 
>
>"What do you mean?" Yui asked.

RIIYA:	<as Washu> It means that I don't have the slightest fucking idea what
the hell I'm doing!!!

>
>As Yui and Washu spoke, Tenchi took a quiet step backwards, attempting to
>remain unnoticed.

RYOKO:	Tenchi, your wife diesh and you *hic* lose your shpine?

>
>"She will be completely restored in every way except one: her memory."
>
>"She's going to forget who we are?" Aeka said in surprise.
>
>"Yes, but don't worry," Sasami assured the group. "Washu and I are thinking of

REI:	Miya *hic* heh heh heh...nudge nudge...wink wink...

AEKA AND RYOKO:	TENCHI YOU INSHENSHITIVE BASHTARD!!!  *hic*  LEAVING ME LIKE
SOME CHEAP...

HARRY:	<pointing his wand at Riiya> ACCIO BEER!

	The as-yet-unopened beer can flies right out of Riiya's hands, bouncing off
of Aeka's head, knocking her unconcious.  Harry, being drunk, is unable to
control the spell, and the beer can goes sailing over his head and cold-cocks
Ryoko.

REI:	Thanks, I think...*hic*

HARRY:	I just wanted a beer...

>"I'll go talk to him," Aeka volunteered, stepping towards the door. Yui

>"Wait, let me talk to him. It'll be better if I go and speak to him myself."

RIIYA:	FOOD!  <Chomps onto Rei's leg>

REI:	Miya-ouch.

RIIYA:	Your leg tastes terrible.

REI:	Then why did you bite me?!

WASHU:	<ICW> He didn't break the suit, did he?  I'd hate to have to filter out
lycanthropy in addition to other restorations...

REI:	No, it just HURTS!  <forcing off Riiya with an AT field>

>in a poof before

to 
>react to this sudden turn of events.
>
>"Why are you sending Ryo-ohki after them?" she asked.
>  
>"I'm sending her because I'm very concerned for Tenchi.  He was angry that one

HARRY:	<as Washu> Unless I'm mistaken, the next step is the homicidal rage.

RYOKO:	Unghhh...what happened?

HARRY:	Welcome back.

>
>"What did you expect, Washu?" said Sasami in a uncharacteristically accusatory
>tone. "After all, you did keep his wife a secret for the past 13 years,

RIIYA:	<as Washu> ...a lesbian...

RYOKO:	<bursting into tears> Is the Cav and Dav "the Shwitch" experiment going
to haunt me for the resht of my life?

	Shinji jumps from his seat and throws a punch to Riiya.  Riiya shifts to
wolf and the two engage in a drunken brawl.

SHINJI:	LAY OFF MY GRAMMA!

RIIYA:	YOU SON OF A BITCH, DON'T HIT ME!

>dead-" 
>
>"I know that, Sasami!" Washu barked in frustration. "I didn't do this on a

REI:	<as Washu> They're important variables to consider in my psychological
experiment!

>I'm not that cold-hearted!

AEKA:	<as Washu> I'm just insane!

HARRY:	Well I'll be damned, you're back too.

	Shinji and Riiya continue to brawl.
	
RYOKO:	Aeka, would you?

	Aeka summons her shield units, which, in her drunken state, not only zap
Shinji and Riiya, but herself as well into being stunned.

>I was absolutely prepared to bring Ryoko 
>back but I wasn't prepared to know how Tenchi would react.  I don't expect him 
>to forgive me right off the bat; but knowing Tenchi, I'm sure he'll find a way
>to re-evaluate and adjust to this revelation... like he always does."

REI:	<as Washu> He usually simmers down after he runs out of places to hide
bodies.

>
>Sasami was stern. "Let's just hope you're right, Washu, because if he
>doesn't...the one person who you should worry about more is Yui."
>
>Washu didn't flinch at Sasami's words, though realizing that Yui would be even 
>more hurt if Tenchi didn't find a way to adjust to this sudden situation.

RYOKO:	*hic* What about ME?!  Am I going to have to spend more years trying to
get him to notice me again?!

AEKA:	Heh...maybe I get a chance now!

SHINJI:	<recovering> Aren't you married to Davner?

AEKA:	Who?

RYOKO:	Oh *hic* right...you're OAV Aeka.

REI:	*hic* Inkjet's leaking again.

>peculiar thumping sound coming from outside, near the lake.

RIIYA:	<recovering> Oh no...tell me that's not what I think it is...

SHINJI:	Tenchi's shummoning the shandwormsh of Dune!

>Yui flew out of a

REI:	...his spine.

REST OF CAST:	Uh...ow.

RYOKO:	So what took Washu 13 years to do, Tenchi could do in sheconds?  *hic?*

>"Father, stop!" Yui cried out.  It was painful to watch him do this, but her

>THOOMP! THOOMP! THOOMP!

>No response; he kept banging away at the marker.

realizes the hentai double entendre, runs to the railing, and vomits.

RYOKO:	How dry I *hic* am...how dry I *hic* am...

	Lina and Asuka enter the central control area to find all of the MSTers
drunk.  Lina has an arm in a sling, a patch over one eye, and a cervical
collar.  Asuka is on crutches with one leg in a cast, her head and chest are
both bandaged.

LINA:	What the hell...

SHINJI:	Asuka...you're looking reeeeeeeally good right now...*slap!*

	Asuka, vein throbbing on her forehead, has her hand extended the
follow-through of a hard slap.

ASUKA:	Shinji, you drunken ecchi!  I expected drunkenness of Misato...but
you?!

RITSUKO:	<entering behind them> Er...oh yes.  I forgot to plan for this.

LINA:	You what?

RITSUKO:	Well, I used beer in lieu of LCL for this experiment.  It did
wonderfully as a substitute in terms of measurements, but...well...

LINA:	And you didn't anticipate that?  How OOC is that?!

AEKA:	Causality SUCKS!  HAHAHAHA!!!

HARRY:	*hic* What happened to you guys?

LINA:	Well no thanks to Ritsuko, I've got compressed vertebrae from that
damned catapault, among other things!  Remember how I was supposed to engage
Eva-02 in battle?  Well, I used the Ragna Blade.

	Asuka glares at Lina.
	
LINA:	The thing went right through the AT field, but after the trip up the
catapault I was a little on edge...

ASUKA:	A little?!  You nearly cut my Eva in half!  You sliced it from the
torso to the pelvic region!

SHINJI:	So...*hic* why are there so many broken bones?

RITSUKO:	Well, Asuka, being as territorial as she is, ejected the entry
plug, and the two got into a bit of a fight.

LINA:	A *bit* of a fight?!  Ritsuko, were you watching?  Asuka was furious!

RITSUKO:	I'll admit, I've never seen anyone pick up the progressive knife
without an Eva before.

HARRY:	*hic* the Sana-chan effect!

RITSUKO:	Oh, well, we've managed to get the Entry Theater put back together
and even installed a few upgrades.  I guess you'll need to be sobered up first. 
Lina, Rei will be going into the lab for restoration.  You'll be taking your
usual spot in the Entry Theater.

LINA:	Oh joy.  But how am I supposed to MST in this condition?

RITSUKO:	Oh you won't be.  By the way, Riiya, we can send you back home now. 
Newjersey will be recovered shortly.

LINA:	What do you mean, "will be recovered shortly?"

	Ritsuko digs out her PDA, and enters a few commands.  Everything fades to
black, and there is a quick music stinger, a la Final Fantasy VII:

o/~
   o/~ o/~
          o/~   o/~ 0.....
             o/~

	And the scenery fades up on the NERV briefing room.
	
HP/MP RESTORED!
BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL 0.0!

MISATO:	Ack!  I'm sober!

	Around the table are, Gendo, Newjersey, Shinji, Lina, Ryoko, Aeka, Harry,
Misato, and Ritsuko.

NEWJERSEY:	Well I feel much better.  Good to see you back, Harry.  Aeka, long
time no see.

AEKA:	Dr. Silverwolf?  Oh.  I...er...borrowed this...  <she hands back the
whip, the autograph having been recently restored>

NEWJERSEY:	And you even signed it again?  <sniffs the leather> and
waterproofed it!

GENDO:	If you're done...we still have one more piece of this fic to do.

LINA:	And I guess we're the lucky ones, aren't we?

NEWJERSEY:	Must be.  We always use a gender-balanced party of six.

	The cast files into the theater.  The seating order is, from left to right,
Aeka, Newjersey, Ryoko, Shinji, Lina, and Harry.

RITSUKO:	Filling the Entry Theatre.  Power supply connected.  Commencing

border-line.  Initiating second stage connections.  Theatre has activated.

MISATO:	Maya, are you sure you have your finger on the right button this time?

LINA:	Was there some big Ryoko cover-up?

SHINJI:	That's a new one.  A cover-up of aliens by other aliens.  It sounds
feasible but it's the first time I've heard of it as a conspiracy.

>"What do you mean, Tenchi?" Washu was puzzled, a rarity for her.

NEWJERSEY:	So Washu being puzzled is a rarity.  Washu is thus in

HARRY:	...but that was as far as Washu got before Yui formed her energy blade
and beheaded her.

RYOKO:	Harry, what is with you?!

HARRY:	Sorry...I think this place is just affecting me.

SHINJI:	You know, I wish my dad would apologize to me for all the shit he put
me through my whole life.

>"It's alright... I understand," Yui interrupted. "You did what you had to do
>and you did it because your motherly instincts told you to."

>"Indeed," Washu said, relief starting to relax her as she stood. "Would you

>
>The room suddenly became silent.

>"No, I'd like to stay up here for now. I appreciate the fact that you asked

SHINJI:	Thanks, grandma.

AEKA:	Well, if the words are "Till death do us part," Tenchi should be
available again!

happens.

SHINJI:	She's probably got them backed up on Zip cartridges.

LINA:	Zip cartridges.  Those things hold everything.

RYOKO:	Just make sure she uses the right ones, I don't want her MP3 collection
running around my head for the rest of my life.

AEKA:	<sobbing> Tenchi!  Why won't your gems glow for me?

NEWJERSEY:	<dazed> owwwww...

SHINJI:	Answer: you can't.  Just deal with it and pilot your Eva.

AEKA:	Why is it that this place takes everyone with a Y chromosome and knocks
them out of character, turning them into total hentais?!

adverse effects occour.  In the absence of hentai, other hentai enters to fill
the void.

LINA:	Are you KIDDING?!  She exploded!

RYOKO:	Only in our riffs, Lina.  Besides, I'm the one that explodes in this
fic.

>two days," Tenchi said, watching Ryoko's body being scanned by thin beams of
>light.

RYOKO:	First I'm dead, then I explode, then I'm reassembled, ressurected,
glazed like a donut and now Washu's computer is feeling me up!  Oh gee thanks,
I feel really good about this fic!

>"I mean, look. Yui has regained her powers 13 years after mother died,
>only to discover she's still alive."
>
>"It is a lot for any normal person to take in over a span of just 2 days,"
>Aeka agreed. "I hope she doesn't hold anything against Washu."

LINA:	<as Aeka> It's one of those emotional roller-coaster metaphors that
keeps getting overused.

>
>"Apparently, she seems to be sharing the same sentiments that I have."
>
>"Oh?"
>
>"Yui and myself are both willing to put Washu's actions behind us and just

HARRY:	<as Mr. Spock> Emminently logical, captain.

>open up. Otherwise, things could've been much worse..."
>
>"I know," Tenchi said solemnly, noticing that the white substance covering
>Ryoko's body was starting to crumble in the presence of the laser light. As
>the white layers deteriorated, Ryoko's beautiful skin was visible once more.

NEWJERSEY:	So why do women have to do such disgusting things to get their skin
to look so good?  I mean, really, mud, clay, other forms of glop...

RYOKO:	It's so we can get jerks like you to ask us out.

NEWJERSEY:	Ouch.

>Afterwards, Ryoko floated to the third and final tank.

>"Epidermal scan and transition complete. Skin condition: ready. Initiating

>In the third tank, Ryoko's body was engulfed by a huge pillar of light

AEKA:	<as Washu> Uh oh, I just sent my daughter to Gaea.

HARRY:	<as Van Fanel> This happens a lot around here...

>coming
>from the tank's emitters.  Washu explained over the noise of the machinery
>that this would re-adapt Ryoko's skin to adjust to any atmosphere.

SHINJI:	<as Tenchi> WHAT?

LINA:	<as Washu> I SAID, THIS WOULD RE-ADAPT RYOKO'S SKIN TO ANY ATMOSPHERE!

SHINJI:	<as Tenchi> WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A-KO, HAT, AND SPHERE?

LINA:	<as Washu> I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HAT FEAR!

>
>After being bathed by the pillar of light, Ryoko's unconscious body started to

RYOKO:	<as Washu's computer> Thank you for using AT&T.

>
>"Yes, I have them," he said, holding out his Tenchi-ken.

HARRY:	Tenchi just whips it out for any of the girls, doesn't he?  Maybe he
thinks he's in a Lemon fic.

SHINJI:	<as Tenchi> Whoa...force of habit, there...forgot I was actually in a
real fan fiction for once.

>The gems on the hilt
>were shining even more brightly then he had ever seen them. "What's next?"
>
>"I'm going up to the bridge of the Tsunami to finish up the final adjustments.
>Sasami will brief you,"

NEWJERSEY:	Then she'll pants you...

>Washu told Tenchi. "I want you to listen to her
>instructions *very* carefully."

RYOKO:	<as Washu> This Genius will self-destruct in sixty seconds.

LINA:	Must EVERYONE explode in this fic?
>
>"Don't worry, I will," Tenchi replied assuredly.
>
>"OK, then. I'll see you later." Washu suddenly teleported to her destination,
>Azaka and Kamadake closely in tow.
>
>Tenchi and Aeka stood next to each other, knowing that they were just minutes
>away from reuniting with Ryoko.

SHINJI:	Fifth impact, here we come.

>Sasami walked up to Tenchi.
>
>"Tenchi, how are you feeling?" she asked.

RYOKO:	<Looking daggers at all the guys> Don't...say...anything.

>
>"I'm just a little nervous, but I'm feeling fine otherwise," Tenchi said. "OK
>Sasami, I'm ready. What do you want me to do?"
>
>"OK, Tenchi; before I give you the plan, let me explain to Aeka how this
>works, because you know this already."

AEKA:	I am NOT an idiot!

NEWJERSEY:	Nobody said you were...

> She turned to the Juraian empress. "The
>reason that we need to use Ryoko's gems is because they've been with her most
>of her life, especially the gem on her left wrist."
>
>"I see," Aeka said in fascination, recalling the hint her sister had given to
>her earlier. "The gems record history as seen by Ryoko as well..."

SHINJI:	Wow, you have a director's cut of everything on your wrists, grandma?

HARRY:	Watch out, Tenchi fans will be after you in force.

>
>"That's right. We will use the gems to transplant Ryoko's memories into the
>regenerated body." Sasami turned to Tenchi. "OK, Tenchi, here's the plan."

LINA:	Shouldn't Sasami have said that before she started on the plan?

> She
>produced a pair of black shorts, made of very thin cloth.
>
>"Uhh... what do you want me to do with these shorts?" he asked, nervously
>eyeing the black cloth.

RYOKO:	I'd like you to chippendale dance for me in those shorts, Tenchi.

>
>"I want you to take off all your clothes

HARRY:	GAHHHHH!  LEMON!

>and put these on."
>
>Tenchi face-faulted.

AEKA:	As did the reader.

>
>"What?! *All* my clothes?"
>
>"Yes, all of them. What we're about to do must be free of static electricity 
>or otherwise.

CAST:	PIKA-CHUUUUU!

>Any disruptive energy can tamper with the memory transfer."

SHINJI:	Damn sync noise...

>
>"I understand,"  Tenchi said, walking behind a huge computer to change out of
>sight of the women. He changed into the shorts as quickly as he could. "Are
>you coming along too, Aeka?"

NEWJERSEY:	Ewww...all over the lab, too.  <Gets whacked by Aeka> OW!

>
>"Yes, I am. I hope you don't mind."
>
>"I don't mind, Aeka. I guess it wouldn't hurt anybody." Tenchi walked towards
>Sasami. "Now tell me the rest of the plan, Sasami."
>
>"We're going up to bridge of the Tsunami. Once we're there, you'll see that
>Ryoko is being held above the water of the pool.  Once you're in the pool, I

SHINJI:	Otherwise Grandma will drown.

RYOKO:	Don't be silly, Shinji...i can take hard vacuum, why worry about
drowning?

> after she's in your arms, give her

LINA:	...booty...

RYOKO:	Yes, please...er, from Tenchi, I mean.

AEKA:	Riiiight.

RYOKO:	Are you implying something?

AEKA:	I think Cav & Dav's MST of "The Switch" gives all the implication
necessary.

RYOKO:	You wanna go at it Shin style, bitch?

HARRY:	Guys, I don't want to spend the next few minutes unconcious again.

>"Alright, that sounds simple enough."

>Tenchi cleared his mind, taking in a deep breath. "Yes."
>

NEWJERSEY:	Three asterisks?  That's the sign of Tenchi's power?

SHINJI:	<as Washu> I'll have a Big Mac and a medium Sprite.

HARRY:	<as Azaka> Do you want fries with that?

>
>"Careful, you two. Tenchi should be here any minute now," Washu said, glancing
>about her surroundings.
>
>"Yes, ma'am!"
>
>Just standing in the bridge of the tree-ship Tsunami was enough to fascinate

RYOKO:	Okay...just thinking of mom as a Martha Stewart is very disturbing.

>Nearby, a bright envelope of light appeared in front of the main space tree,

>"Ooooh! Nice butt, Tenchi!" Washu said fiendishly. "And you used to ask why

>
>"Um... can we get started?" Tenchi said, a sweatdrop forming on his head. "I

>"Sure, OK.  Whatever you want, Tenchi." Washu grinned. "Tsunami,

>"Right," Sasami said in compliance. *Will you PLEASE call me 

HARRY:	<as Sasami, thinking> ...with 1-800-COLLECT?

>Sasami, Washu!*
>
>Tenchi began to feel himself being levitated off the ground by Sasami's

>Tenchi-ken tightly;

NEWJERSEY:	<as Butthead> Huh huh huh...he's holding his Tenchi-ken...huh huh
huh...

AEKA:	All right...I'm getting just a bit tired of the Tenchi-ken double
entendre.  That item is sacred to my people!

HARRY:	Can't you take a joke?

AEKA:	It was funny the first few times, but it's starting to wear a little
thin.

LINA:	You know, I'll bet you've gone so hentai to compensate for the lack of
it in this fic, I'll bet any of you guys can't go without making a hentai
remark.

NEWJERSEY:	How much?

LINA:	The loser pays for the next dinner.

RYOKO:	Lina's betting food?!

>instead of a cold chill he felt a

>"OK, Azaka and Kamidake. Bring Ryoko into the water,"  Washu ordered.

>The pair of logs slowly lowered Ryoko towards the water, right above Tenchi.

>"Tenchi, I want you to place the Tenchi-ken

ALL THE GUYS:	*snort*

ALL THE GUYS:	*chuckle*

>towards the bottom of the pool, catching it underneath his foot.

NEWJERSEY:	DAAAAMN!  Now THAT'S flexibility!

LINA:	HA!  You lose, Newjersey!

NEWJERSEY:	Doesn't matter, I never agreed to the bet.

LINA:	What, you gonna welch out?

NEWJERSEY:	No, I never agreed to the bet.  You can even check the mission log. 
The last time I took you out to dinner I nearly depleted my budget allocation.

>The

>"Are you ready, sir?" Kamidake asked Tenchi.
>
>"Yes, I'm ready," Tenchi said, anticipating catching Ryoko's body. "Drop her."
>
>Azaka and Kamidake dispelled the forcefield, sending Ryoko into Tenchi's arms.

RYOKO:	Oh, Tenchi!

HARRY:	Uh...you don't know who he is yet.  Your memory hasn't been restored.

>As he caught her, he was surprised at her weight; she was lighter than the
>last time he'd carried her. 

AEKA:	Thanks to new ultra Slim-Fast!

>Nevertheless, he smiled when he could hear her soft,
>rhythmic breathing; he could almost feel her heartbeat as well.
>
>Tenchi proceeded to follow Washu's instructions, lowering Ryoko's body into
>the water until only her face was visible.

RYOKO:	If only my face is visible in this liquid...i don't think it's water.

>
>"Alright, Tenchi," said Washu. "Just wait for the gems to react now."
>
>At the base of the pool, the gems embedded in the hilt of the Tenchi-ken began
>to feel the presence of Ryoko. Reacting to her newly-reawakened energy, they
>began to shine brighter than the most brilliant daylight.

SHINJI:	<as Washu> Hmmm...I wonder if I should tell Tenchi I've been storing
nuclear waste in there...

> The waters of the
>Tsunami's pool began to shine with the light of the gems, eventually reaching
>the same luminescence. As a result of the energy reaction, the emblem on
>Tenchi's forehead began to glow.
>
>Ryoko's impulsive twitching brought Tenchi to attention;

RYOKO:	Ahhh...so that's the secret.  Twitch impulsively.

NEWJERSEY:	This scene vaguely reminds me of Final Fantasy VII.

	Newjersey and Harry close their mouths.

>
>"It looks like Ryoko's coming 

AEKA:	I repeat...

LINA:	I think they got the message.

AEKA:	In that case...ahem...<Tenchi>...eeew, right in the pool, too!

	Newjersey whips Aeka.
	
AEKA:	Do I order you put to death, or do I complement you on being a fine
student?

>to," Sasami said to Aeka.
>
>"Yes, indeed. I hope her memory will be intact," Aeka replied.  Azaka and
>Kamidake phased in beside Aeka, taking up their usual posts as guardians.
>
>"She's waking up!" Tenchi yelled with joy.
>
>"Keep in mind, Tenchi, that Ryoko has not received any of her memories yet!
>Please be ready to receive a negative reaction," advised Washu.

NEWJERSEY:	So I guess that mean's she'll run out and bust up Tenchi's
gravestone.

>
>Tenchi looked down at Ryoko; as her eyes opened, they met her husband's for
>the first time in 13 years. Tenchi's only thoughts were about the beauty in
>Ryoko's yellow felinoid eyes; it had been so long since he'd seen them...

SHINJI:	Washu kept them in formaldehyde all this time.

>
>For what seemed like an eternity, Ryoko looked silently into Tenchi's eyes.
>Then, without warning, she began to thrash about in the water, unable to react
>any other way to this stranger looking at her. The panic in her eyes was so
>evident that Tenchi was genuinely surprised; he was more surprised, though,
>that the pool's waters were dimming.
>
>"Washu! What's going on?!" he yelled.
>
>"The brightness of the pool's light is a direct reflection of Ryoko's mood!"

HARRY:	That's the biggest damn mood ring I've ever seen!

>Washu explained, having already realized the problem. "And we need it to be as
>bright as possible, because as long as it's dim, she's in a very distressed
>state, and that'll only hinder the memory transfer! If she's calm, the pool
>will glow its brightest..."
>
>Sasami picked up where Washu trailed off. "She hasn't recovered any of her
>memories yet. Try to get her to relax; she must be calm enough to allow the
>memory transfer to begin."

SHINJI:	So that's why my net connection keeps dropping!  I need to keep my
computer calm!

>
>Tenchi looked down at his wife. Her panic had transformed into fright; like a
>terrified child, she looked terribly sad, a stream of tears flowing down her
>cheeks and into the rapidly-dimming pond.
>
>*She's as vulnerable as a lost child...* Tenchi thought to himself, looking at
>his reflection on the pool's surface; only now did he notice the glowing
>emblem on his forehead. *That's it! Actions speak louder than words!*  He knew
>what he had to do now; a plan began to form in his mind.

LINA:	Good thing someone's got a plan, I've been confused as to what the
whole plan was from the beginning!  I mean I've seen bits and pieces...

>
>The only feeling coursing through Ryoko, who as far as she could tell had just
>been born, was high anxiety; she didn't know any of these strangers looking at
>her, and she didn't know what was going to happen, so she was scared. All of
>the fear within her, though, was coming from the stranger holding her in his
>arms. 

RYOKO:	Tenchi, why are you still scared of me?  Oh no...are you SHIN?!

>Again she thrashed about, unable to talk because she had no concept of
>speech. 

HARRY:	<imitating computer voice> I am Doctor Sbaitso.

>Then something caught her eye. The glowing emblem on the stranger's
>forehead. Then it was the stranger's gentle eyes. Then it was the warm,
>comforting energy emanating from him. A strange, but welcoming, voice entered
>her mind.

AEKA:	Oh...schizophrenia?

>
>*Don't be afraid... we're here to help you. We are your friends and loved
>ones; please let us help.  You will not be harmed in any way.*

LINA:	<as Ryoko> Yeah right, that's what aliens always say before the anal
probing.

>
>Ryoko realized that the voice was coming from the stranger cradling her in his
>arms. She didn't understand the stranger's words for a second, but she did
>understand the feelings and intentions within the message.  She relaxed and
>decided put her trust in to this stranger, waiting for another sign.

NEWJERSEY:	Slippery when wet.

HARRY:	Merge ahead.

RYOKO:	No tresspassing.

>
>Tenchi had figured out a way to communicate with Ryoko; since Ryoko's gems
>were on the hilt of the Tenchi-ken, he instinctively felt a connection to

AEKA:	Oh Lord Tenchi, why didn't you learn that lesson Yosho did with super
glue?

>Washu, Aeka, and Sasami looked on; Ryoko's panicking suddenly subsided, the
>light from the pool gradually shining brighter.
>
>*Thank goodness. Things are finally starting to looking up,* Aeka thought.
>
>Ryoko relaxed in the stranger's arms, waiting for his voice to speak again.
>After several seconds, it came.

ALL:	HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU WANT US TO EXHAUST THE SAME DOUBLE ENTENDRE?!

>
>*Relax. All you have to do is relax. It'll all come back to you.*
>
>Starting to understand the meaning of the words, she followed the voice's

>and warmer.

SHINJI:	Grandma, is that what happens when you drink great-grandma's mixed
drinks?

> The soothing currents of heat relaxed her even further.

RYOKO:	Ah...the Juraian Jaccuzi.

>
>*Now close you eyes and wait.*
>
>Ryoko slowly closed her eyes, allowing the darkness to enter her mind. For
>several tense minutes, there was nothing else. Then the flood began. A cascade

NEWJERSEY:	Oh crap, I'm having "Dark City" flashbacks.

>The memories flashed through her mind at an alarming rate.

SHINJI:	Where's the "freeze frame" on this entry theater?!

>Near the end of those 700 years, she saw Tenchi Masaki for the first time.

Ouch.

NEWJERSEY:	Azaka and Kamidake crashed?

AEKA:	Don't be silly, Azaka and Kamidake are year 20,000 compliant.

MISATO:	<ICW> I just checked it, it's not working.

	The fic ends, and the Entry Theater drains.  After all the MST'ers exhale
the LCL from their lungs, Newjersey shifts wolf and shakes all the fluid out of
his fur.

AEKA:	MUST you do that?!

	A few minutes later, the MSTers are in the briefing room, wearing their
normal clothes.  Newjersey is in human form.

LINA:	You know, of all the fics we could have done, this was actually good. 
I don't know why we had to MST this one.

NEWJERSEY:	Well you know, with a good fic like this, the rant/riff ratio is
quite low.

SHINJI:	So why did we MST this fic?

GENDO:	THAT...is a secret.

LINA:	FIREBALL!!!  <Blasts Gendo>

AUTHOR'S NOTES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
	This is by far the largest fic I've ever done, so I would like to just make
an all-inclusive acknowledgement of intellectual property.  All
characters/concepts included herein are property of their respective owners.
	I've paid homage to two of the MSTing greats, Cav and Dav.  Keep up the
good work, guys.  The TMFFA needs it.
	I think I've thoroughly exhausted several riffs and puns, but some are
classics and sometimes authors just walk into them.  I hope you enjoyed the
MST, and Long...I'm laughing with you, not at you.

<Newjersey> But aren't you kinda human yourself?  <San> I am not human!  I am a
wolf!  <Newjersey> What a coincidence!  So am I!  Wanna go for coffee?
