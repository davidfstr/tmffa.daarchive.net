regain consciousness, just to hear some thrashing, as two hunters break 
through the bushes.

could make some good Cantonese style sweet-and-sour pork.

blanket.

to be knocked aside by P-chan.  P-chan continues down the hill, as
Mousse swoops passed him.  The two continue to struggle as they reach
the kettle.  P-chan finally gets free and dumps the kettle on himself,
only find it empty except for a few whisps of steam.
