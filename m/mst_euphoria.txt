Note: This is my first attempt at a MSTing. I used some of the characters from
my pokemon fanfics. Well, here are the usual legal stuff; all Tenchi characters
are owned by AIC and Pioneer, all pokemon characters like Brock and Erika are
property of Nintendo, Game Freak, and Viz Communications; and all other 
characters are mine. The original story is by Ryo-ohki.

Note2: For those of you familiar with my pokemon fanfics ( not many, for
good reason:) ), this story is outside of the continuity. Just borrowing the
characters for a bit.

Anyway, let me introduce the characters to those who aren’t familiar:

Brock: ex-Pewter City gym leader. Now 23 years old. He’s usually girl-
crazy, and Laronda is his girlfriend ( sort of ).
Erika: ex-Celadon City gym leader. Now 29 years old. Really innocent.
Laronda: 22 year old pokemon trainer. She’s Erika’s best friend, and
unconsciously in love with Brock. She thinks that she’s just his friend,
though. She’s incredibly smart and incredibly beautiful, and she hates
George, for no particular reason.
George: Ex-member of Team Rocket who now runs his own mob.
He has no morals. Oh, yea, he’s in *lust* with Laronda.

===============================================================

Brock: Well, they traced George to this abandoned warehouse.
Laronda: Great. Now we can finally catch him.
Erika: Be careful. George is tricky.

( Suddenly, George pops out onto the warehouse’s main floor. )

George ( laughing ): I’ve finally got you in my trap. And, oh, Laronda,
how nice to see you. You’re as lovely as ever.
( Laronda seethes )
Brock: What trap?
George: Look up. ( George opens a hatch into the cellar ). Bye now.
( The gang looks up )
Erika: Look! Voltorbs! Thousands of them!
( Suddenly all of the doors and windows are sealed with iron bars.
Brock: Onix, ram through those doors!
( Onix slammed into the doors, but an electric charge shocks it into
unconsciousness ).
Erika: What are we gonna do now?
Brock: It gets worse. Look!
( All of the Voltorbs start humming )
Brock: Laronda?
( Laronda picks the lock off of George’s hatch with her silver barrettes ).
Laronda: Come on, follow me!
( They follow Laronda into the basement, where George is looking at another
iron door in disgust. )
George: I can’t believe it! My own men, trapping me in here. I’ve been doublecrossed!
Laronda ( sarcastically ): What goes around, comes around.
( Suddenly a huge explosion shakes their bunker )
Brock: That must have been the voltorbs!
Laronda: There’s no way out now! We’ve got a whole building collapsed above
us.
George: Well, nothing to do in here but look at these old fanfics.
Everyone else: Fanfics?
George: Yea. Based on Tenchi Muyo.
Erika: We met Tenchi once. Nice guy.
( Brock and Laronda nudge her into silence. )
Laronda ( whispering in Erika’s ear ): No one’s supposed to know about *that*.
George: Oh, really. Well, this should interest you. Since we have nothing else to
do until we’re rescued, might as well look at these.
Laronda: Sure, why not? What do we have?
( The three sit down as George pops a tape into a TV/VCR combo in the bunker ).
George: We have euphoria. Like I’m having sitting next to a stacked babe
like you, Laronda.
Brock: Watch it, man.
Erika: Ssshh! It’s starting!

>Euphoria - By Ryo-ohki

Brock: Wow. Had no idea Ryo-ohki could write.
Laronda: Wonder what the cabbit has to say.
( Brock wraps his arms around her as the two snuggle together )
Erika: Am I a third wheel here?
George: Yep. Indeed.

Laronda: You’re disgusting, George. Brock, are you sure about this movie?

Erika: Ssshhh! You two!

Laronda: Have any of you seen At the Carrot Patch? I never saw it.
George: I loved it.
Laronda: Then I’m sure this movie will be awful, then.
Erika: You really don’t like George, do you?
Laronda: Nope, hate him.
George: But I think you’re the sexiest woman on Earth.
( Laronda then backslaps him ).

George: Well, maybe a new racket for GERO.
Erika: Sshhh.


>And now on to the story....

Laronda: About time.

>	The day began as any other day, but today was no ordinary day for Ryouko.  She was 
had a lot in store for Tenchi so that he would be hers forever.  She left the house shortly 
after lunch and told everyone that she wouldn't be back until late in the night.  Everyone
naturally assumed that she had gone on a date with some other man after getting tired of
>pursuing Tenchi. 

Brock: Why would anyone think she would have gotten tired of pursuing Tenchi?
Is there any evidence of this?
Erika: Sshh. Let’s watch.

> Ayeka thought that she would take advantage of the situation by making
a romantic dinner that would capture Tenchi's heart and make him notice her.  What nobody
didn't know was that Ryouko hadn't actually left the house but was secretly sitting in the
>basement to wait for the right time.

Laronda: What nobody didn’t know? Someone find Ryo-ohki a grammar tutor!
George: Stuck up to the end, eh? Give her a chance!
Brock: Laronda, dear, I wonder what Ryoko is waiting for?
George: Man, you’re naiver than I thought. I’ve seen the Carrot Patch.
Trust me, it’s gonna get good.
Laronda: Oh, dear, as warped as you are, I have a feeling we’re about to see
some sick stuff.


>      Ayeka cooked two separate dinners, one for Tenchi and herself and one for everyone else.

Erika: But, but, Ayeka can’t cook! Why would she be cooking when Sasami’s around!
George: You OBVIOUSLY didn’t see the Carrot Patch. Sasami’s in no condition
to cook.

>Ayeka also set up another table in a separate room, away from everyone else so they wouldn't
be interrupted.  Everyone came to the table sat down, and began the meal.  Ryouko turned 
>intangible so that she was now able to come up through the floor.  After poking her head

Erika: How can someone turn intangible?
Laronda: Mystifying.

>through the floor she saw that neither Tenchi nor Ayeka were at the table 
>or Ayeka at the table anywhere.

Laronda: Redundancy. This is lousy. Almost as bad as a Gary Oak film.

>	"That wench, Ayeka, she took MY Tenchi" exclaimed Ryouko "I hope she's not planning
>to take MY Tenchi away from me because he's MINE.  "If I find that she's with MY Tenchi 

George: I like possessiveness in a woman. Laronda, baby, why can’t you
be jealous over me like that?
Brock: Hey, watch it.
( Laronda’s really trying to ignore George )

>I'll give her a beating that she'll never forget.  Maybe then she'll learn not to steal
>my man, ever again.  

George: Whip me, sock me ... wait a minute, Ayeka might like getting beat ...
Erika: will all of you SHUT UP!

>	Ryouko sunk back under the floor to continue her search for Tenchi.  The first place
she check was the bedrooms but found that they weren't there, which greatly relieved >Ryouko.

George: Ryoko relieved herself in the bedroom?
Laronda: You are the most perverse man I have ever met.

>She finally found them in a dark, secluded room that was connected to Ayeka's bedroom that
only Ayeka had access to, until now.  

Brock: How could only Ayeka have access to the room when it’s not
even her house?
George: Man, it’s getting to the good part, sshhh!
Erika: The good part! Ssshhh!
( Brock places his arm around Laronda )

>Ryouko came up through the floor, under the table and 
crouched under it.  She became solid again and was careful not to alert Ayeka of her presence.

Brock: Dear, can Ryoko can fit under a table?
Laronda: Brock, this violates all plausibility.
Everyone else: Huh?
Laronda: I mean, it’s impossible. ( she shrugs )

>Luckily Ayeka had used a long tablecloth that reached the floor so she wouldn't be interrupted
from her plans.  Slowly she knelt in front of Tenchi but didn't touch him yet, she had to 
carefully plan this so that Tenchi wouldn't be too alarmed so that she wouldn't alert anyone of
>her position.

Erika: Now, I’m confused. What position?
Laronda: This whole story has me baffled.

>	After much thoughtful planning she brought her plans up to Tenchi's lap and lightly caressed
>the front of Tenchi's pants.  Tenchi looked up at Ayeka at turned a bright shade of red.

George: Work it, baby!
Laronda: You are absolutely disgusting, you know that?
Brock: So is this film.
Erika: I’m confused.
George: So nothing else is new. ( Laronda then glares at him. )
Erika: OK, what I want to know, is what plans did she put in Tenchi’s lap?
George: You’re naive, aren’t you. No wonder Wendell was able to ...
Laronda: Listen, aren’t we supposed to be watching here?


>	"Oh Tenchi did I make your food too spicy for you?" inquired Ayeka

	Tenchi shook his head and returned to his meal trying not to give anything else away.
>Ryouko paused for a moment to see if Tenchi had given away her position.  After a couple 

Brock: I thought Ryoko was hiding under a table.
Laronda: She was. I don’t see how Tenchi suddenly knows she’s down there.

>seconds
she continued to caress Tenchi's slowly hardening pole.  Soon Tenchi's dick was at full mast and
bloated with blood.  His prick was becoming sore so Ryouko decided to undo his pants for >him.  She

Erika ( wincing and turning away ): Disgusting.
( Brock covers Laronda’s eyes before George moves his hands )
George: Come on, Laronda, you need to watch what I’m gonna do to you some
day. 
Brock: Watch it, man ( gripping a pokeball )

>was almost hit in the face as his full length came flying straight at her face.  Ryouko caught
the bloated shaft at the base with her left hand and softly started to run her fingers up and down
his entire length.  Tenchi tried hard not to moan, whimper or start breathing heavy as it would
>give away what was going on and he definitely didn't want this to stop.
  
Erika ( innocently ): How can that almost hit her in the face?
Laronda: Brock, this movie is disgusting. Is there any way out of here?
Brock: I agree, but unfortunately, I think we’re stuck.
Laronda: I’m gonna puke. I just know it.

>The danger of the situation

Brock: I fail to see how this situation could be dangerous.
Laronda: Dangerous to my lunch.
( A clearly disgusted look on her face )

>was very arousing for Tenchi.  In an effort to release the tension, Tenchi curled his toes upwards.
He accidentally stuck his toe of his shoe into Ryouko's groin.  Ryouko was surprised at this and
>started to take her plan further.  

Brock: Ow, that’s gotta hurt. 
Laronda: This is totally impossible. All this happens, and Ayeka doesn’t even notice?
Erika: Sshhh!
Laronda: Why? This is just nastiness.

>	Ryouko once again turned intangible and sunk back trough the floor.

	"No, please don't leave me now, not when it was just getting good." Tenchi thought >to himself

George: Man, Tenchi, go down after her!
Brock: Listen, you’re even worse than the fic.

>	Once in the basement Ryouko stripped herself of all her clothing but hadn't yet become solid.

Erika: She gave all her clothes away?
George: You’re such a bubblehead.

>When she was totally naked, she returned to the underside of the table and resumed her caresses on
Tenchi's upright dick.  Tenchi exhaled a sigh of relief and contentment, Ayeka congratulated herself
>on her meal as she thought Tenchi was merely enjoying the meal.  

Laronda: Sorry, no one could be that oblivious to reality.
George: Look who’s talking. You’re the hottest chick I’ve ever seen, and yet you
wear those cute little barrettes and those conservative long dresses...
( Laronda backslaps him )
Brock: Laronda, sweetie, I don’t think this fic is based in reality.

>After Ryouko was sure that Tenchi was
completely aroused, she slowly licked the underside of Tenchi's cockhead.  Tenchi fought desperately
>to hold in his moans of pleasure.

Erika: That’s disgusting! The most disgusting thing I’ve ever heard!
George: Is she for real?
Laronda: I’d tend to agree with Erika ...
George: I will say, though, if a b***h is doin’ that to me, I’d be going out of my mind.  

>	Tenchi knew what Ryouko was thinking and removed his shoe and sock off of his right foot.  He once
again stuck his foot back into Ryouko's groin and started to massage her swollen clit with his >big toe.

Laronda: Tenchi can take off his shoes and socks and massage Ryoko, and
Ayeka still not notice? Is she deaf and blind?
Brock: Dear, I know you used to work in show business, but ...
Laronda: But this is disgusting! Come on, if you were sitting at a table, and someone
was doing all this under the table ...
Erika: Ssshhh!

>Ryouko pushed downward with all her weight and forced Tenchi's toe into her love-canal.  Tenchi began to
>move his toe around within Ryouko's womanly depths. 

Erika: How long are Tenchi’s toes? That can’t be easy to do.
Brock: What’s a love-canal?
George: You’re dating that ( pointing to Laronda and her shall we say
ample bosom ) and don’t know what a love-canal is?
Laronda: That’s why you’re single. George, you’re disgusting.
Erika: Ssshh! 

> Ryouko began to suck wildly on Tenchi's throbbing 
cock as Tenchi's half-kicked his foot upwards in an effort to get more of his toe inside >Ryouko.  Ryouko

Brock: Ryoko must have a high threshold of pain not to be hurt by getting half-kicked
in the groin.
Laronda: And Ayeka still notices nothing.

>swirled her tongue around the head as a way of thanking Tenchi.  She moved her hips up 

Brock: So she’s thanking Tenchi for kicking her in the groin?
Erika: Half-kicking, I guess.
Brock: What’s a half-kick? Either he kicked her or he didn’t.

>and down in the same
rhythm as Tenchi's upward strokes.  Ryouko bobbed her head down everytime that Tenchi's >foot came up and 

Brock: They’re doing it with feet? I don’t get it?
Laronda: I’m going to get the barf bag, I’ll be back.

>pushed down with her cunt lips in an effort to swallow Tenchi's toe.

Erika: Now, see, you swallow with your mouth. What’s she talking about?
George: This girl has got to be kidding me.

>	Meanwhile everyone had finished their dinner and had gone about their regular activities.  Washuu was
>in her lab.  Sasami and Ryo-ohki were off playing outside as they always do.  But, Ayeka 

Brock: But if Ryo-ohki was outside all this time, how did she write this
fic?
Laronda ( back with the barf bag, handing one to Brock ): Like I said, this
whole fic is impossible.

>was eating as slowly
>as possible in an effort to savor her time with Tenchi.

George: I think Tenchi was doing the savoring tonight. 

>	"Why aren't you eating your dinner Tenchi?"  Ayeka asked inquisitively,  "Don't you like the meal that 
>I made for you?"

Brock: Now correct me if I’m wrong, but Ayeka never cooks, right?
Laronda: Yes. So it’s probably no surprise that Tenchi isn’t about to touch
whatever she tried to cook.

>	Tenchi scooped up some of what was on his plate with his fork and swallowed it.  He followed it up with
>a weak smile to make dissipate Ayeka's suspicions.  

Brock: He’s probably nauseous.
Erika: Sshhh!

>It didn't work however, as she was beginning to suspect
>something was wrong.

Laronda: Beginning to suspect?


>	"Oh, yes!!!  Here it comes, I'm gonna cum straight down Ryouko's sweet throat" thought Tenchi.  He

George: I’m sorry, it’s Ryoko doing the savoring. Mea culpa.
Erika: What does cum mean?
George: You really have to get out more.


>put everything he had into bringing Ryouko over the edge of orgasm also.  Tenchi increased his pace without
>making it obvious.  

Laronda: Now that, once again is impossible. How is Ayeka not seeing any of this?
George: You know from personal experience? Why Laronda, you little freak
you! I knew a girl with a body like yours had to be getting hers. Brock, what’s it
like?
( Laronda was angry ).
Laronda: I’m no pervert, you ... pervert!
Brock: Yea, what she said!

>Under the table, Ryouko's head was bobbing madly up and down on Tenchi's fully aroused
prick.  Tenchi brought his hands down to his lap and placed them on the back of Ryouko's head.  He brought
Ryouko's head down faster and harder on his dick.  He felt  the head of his cock hitting Ryouko's the back
of Ryouko's throat.  Finally Ryouko rammed her lips down to the base of Tenchi's hard cock and savored the
>flavor of Tenchi's sweet jizz. 

George: Way to work it!
Laronda: WHERE’S AYEKA?!
Brock: We know, sweetie, she’s deaf, she’s blind, whatever. But seriously, this
is disgusting. I apologize for this movie, dear.
Laronda: It’s OK. Not your fault. It’s the fault of guys like George here.
George: If you two are gonna get all mushy, and start kissing and going on
from there - hey wait until after the movie. I’d love to watch!
Erika: We’re not gonna get to finish seeing this filth if you all don’t SHUT UP!
 
>At the same time, Tenchi kicked his foot up and lifted Ryouko up off the 
>floor with one foot and jammed his foot as deep as he could into Ryouko's dripping cunt.  

( Laronda raised a hand in disgust ).

Brock: I know, dear, I know ( as he put his arm back around her ).

>She tightened her 
>lips around Tenchi's huge dick and barely managed to keep all of his cum in her mouth, 

George: Now see, only a dick like that can tame and satisfy a stacked girl like you, Laronda.
Brock: One more insult to my girlfriend, and we battle.
George: Bring it on. You know none of you here can beat me.

>without spilling any of it.

George: Bill Clinton, I just found you a new intern.
Erika: Ssshh!!

>Ryouko let it sit for a while and then swallowed it slowly so she could feel it slipping down into her throat
>and into her stomach.

Brock: Well, it probably will taste better than Ayeka’s cooking.
Everyone else: Brock?

>	Ryouko put Tenchi's sock and shoe back on, then sunk back into the basement where she got herself
dressed again.  She then teleported herself outside and acted as if she had just arrived home from the perfect
>date with the perfect man.

George: Perfect date, but I’m the perfect man, dear.
Laronda ( to Erika ): And he wonders why I detest him?

>	After cleaning up all the dishes from dinner, Ayeka turned her attention to Tenchi.

	"Are you alright, Tenchi?"  inquired Ayeka "You were acting very strangely during dinner and I think
>you might be coming down with something."  

George: Or going down with something. Better yet, the way it’s stated is just fine.

>She put her hand to Tenchi's forehead, but felt nothing strange.
"Maybe you're feeling lonely because Ryouko  left you tonight.  Well you can forget about that slut, because
>I'm the one that really loves you.  Forget about that slut, she left for her own personal needs 

George: And those needs were fulfilled. Laronda, when are you gonna fulfill
my needs like that?
Brock: That’s it. We fight. Graveler, go!
Graveler: Graveler!
George: No problem: Vaporeon, water gun attack!
Erika: Stop!
George and Brock: why?
Erika: You want to flood the place?
George: Good point.
Brock: Just, stop making dirty jokes about my girlfriend, OK?
George ( looking at Laronda’s figure ): She’s an incredibly easy target, but OK,
I promise ( crossing his fingers behind his back ).

>without a
second thought."

>	Ayeka closed her door and then turned around and gave Tenchi a lust filled gaze. She began to 
bring herself closer to Tenchi's body and pressed herself softly against him.  She rubbed the tips of her 
tits against Tenchi's chest until her nipples became fully erect and were visible
>through her kimono.  

Erika: How big are her tits? What kind of material is her kimono made of?
Laronda: Erika, don’t ask, don’t ask.

>Tenchi couldn't help but look down Ayeka's kimono as he hugged her close to him.  His
dick raised up and poked Ayeka in the stomach.

George ( saluting ): Poked her in the stomach? Now that’s a dick! Reminds me
of me!
Laronda: Reminds me of you, too. Slime through and through.

>	"Oh, Tenchi!" exclaimed Ayeka "are you getting turned on due to my actions?"

	This wasn't one of the  questions that she was going to let Tenchi answer.  Ayeka reached out and 
>began to slowly stroke the front of Tenchi's slacks with her right hand.  With her left hand 

Erika: I thought she did this earlier in the fic.
Laronda: Yes, before she went blind and deaf.
George: Hey, with a dick like this, you can make a woman go ...
( Brock covers George’s mouth ).
Laronda: Thanks, dear. He’s even worse than this fic, and this fic is
pretty bad.

>Ayeka reached for
>Tenchi's zipper and brought it down slowly so that it made a long buzzing sound.  Tenchi 

Erika: Wait. Didn’t Ryoko already unzip him? I don’t remember him zipping back up.
Laronda: Don’t ask, don’t ask.

>brought both of his 
hands to Ayeka's shoulders and slid her kimono down off of her shoulders.  Tenchi found that Ayeka had planned
>all of this by the fact that she wore no bra and was completely bare under her kimono.  

George: What do you wear under those long silk dresses of yours?
Brock ( balling his fists ): What did I tell you?
Laronda: Leave him alone in his depravity. George, what I’m wearing is none
of your business.
George: That’s OK. I’ve seen what you have to offer anyway. 
Laronda: When was that?
Brock: yea, WHEN?

>Tenchi let the top half
>of Ayeka's kimono hang down and brought his hands to Ayeka's fleshy breasts.  He gently 

Brock: Are there any other type of breasts?
Laronda: Silicone, I guess ...
George ( pointing to Laronda’s, well, you know ): So that’s your secret.
Laronda: I’ll have you know that these are perfectly ... uh, mind your business.

>kneaded the flesh that
was Ayeka's tits.  He started around the soft edges and worked his way in towards her erect nipples that stood out
a full half-inch from the rest of her tit.  Ayeka began to moan audibly as the sensations ran from her nipples
>from her nipples to her sensitive clitoris.  

Erika: Kneaded the flesh? That’s gotta hurt! ( Holding George as she winces ).
George: Wow, Erika, hmm. Maybe I’ve been going after the wrong girl.
( Erika then lets go of George )
Erika: Don’t get any thoughts.
George: You’re so innocent, you wouldn’t even know what thoughts I’m thinking.
Laronda: That would have been true, that is, before Erika saw this fic.

>Tenchi took each nipple between a thumb and a finger and began to
rub it back and forth between them.  He leaned forward and took one into his mouth, Tenchi ran a lap around the
sensitive nipple with his tongue. 

Brock: Laronda, baby, I’m missing something. Just what’s the plot?
Laronda: Hormones run amok.

 Then he took the fully erect nipple between his teeth and began to nibble on
>it slightly, while nibbling he kept licking the tip with the end of his tongue.

Erika: That’s gotta hurt!
George: Wanna find out how much?
Erika: Not really.

>	Ayeka slipped Tenchi's full cock out through the fly in Tenchi's pants.  It stood out a full eight inches
>from his hips.  Ayeka was mesmerized by its length and width that she never knew possible.  

Laronda: Now I don’t get it. If it’s only eight inches long, how could it poke her in
the stomach? Impossible. It’d have to be at least ... 13 or 14 inches, I think.
George: Like me, then.
Laronda: Will you shut up, greaseball?
George: I know you want some of this big LOOONG, fat, filthy, nasty, *greasy* dick.
Brock: I’m telling you, George, as soon as we get out of here, I’m kicking
your a**.

>She kneeled down on the 
>ground in front of Tenchi and pulled him down onto her mattress with her.  Tenchi lay 

Laronda: Now see, weren’t they in the secret room?
Brock: I thought so.
Erika: Me too.
George: Guess you three don’t know anything about hot, wild, passionate love.
Laronda: This isn’t love. It’s not even lust. It’s ...
Erika: Sick. Perverted. Twisted.
Laronda: Thanks.

>down on the bed to see what
she was going to do.  Ayeka was at his feet, kneeling at the edge of the bed.  She undid the button on his pants and
pulled them off his muscular legs, and gracefully threw them into a corner of the room.  Tenchi took of his shirt
and threw it into another corner of the room.  Ayeka crawled forward so that she had her soft lips positioned
above Tenchi's upright dick.  She licked all around the tip, lubricating it with her saliva.  She bobbed her head
down all the way to the base a couple of times so that the entire thing was lubricated up.  Ayeka stood up on her
knees and walked forward until she was directly above Tenchi's cock.  Tenchi placed his hands upon her hips and 
looked deep into her eyes.  He could tell that she wanted him badly because her womanly moisture was dripping down
>and lubing his dick even more.  

Laronda: Just think about all that for a bit, and ask yourself if it’s possible to
stand up on your knees.
Brock: You know, I’m beginning to see your points, Laronda. This is disgusting
and unreal.
George: Maybe in your universe, Brock. I tell you, if *I* had Laronda, nothing
would be impossible.

>They both smiled at each other which signaled that they were both ready.  Tenchi 
forced Ayeka's hips down as she dropped all of her weight downwards.  Tenchi's huge prick drove deep into Ayeka's
warm depths.  Tenchi pulled down until Ayeka's pussy lips had come all the way down to >the very base of his manhood.

George: For all those that think Tenchi loves Ryoko more than Ayeka, notice that
Ryoko gets a toe while Ayeka gets ...
Laronda: What’s love got to do with this?

>He held Ayeka down so that they could both enjoy the pleasure of their first sexual experience together.  Tenchi

Erika: What? Is she trying to get away?
Laronda: If she had any sense she would.

>pushed up on Ayeka's hips, her cunt made a delightful squishing sound as Tenchi penetrated her pussy.  He stuffed
>himself into her inch by inch.  Once he had totally buried his meat inside his lover's hole, he 

Laronda: Not to bring this up, but George, has Tenchi ever heard of
safe sex? I mean, they aren’t using any protection.
George: Laronda, that’s the best way!
Laronda ( obviously disgusted ): Well, really, if you’re gonna fornicate, at least ...
George: Listen, babe, I’ve yet to see a lemon fanfic where someone uses a
condom.

>brought her back up 
so that just the head of his dick was left inside her, slowly brought her back down to the very >base of his dick.

George: Textbook, man.


>	Oh! Dearest Tenchi, you feel so good inside me.  Pump you dick into me harder, faster, oh yes!!  Doesn't 
>this make you feel better after that wench, Ryouko, left you for another man?

Brock: Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t Ayeka be HAPPY if she thought
Ryoko left Tenchi?
George: Oh, she’s VERY happy right now.
Laronda: My question is, if Ayeka thought Tenchi was her man all along, why would
she say Ryoko LEFT him?
Brock: Good point.

>	Ayeka began to raise and lower herself on Tenchi's cock faster and faster until they both had gotten into
a pounding rhythm.  Tenchi looked up and saw Ayeka's tits flopping up and down in front of his face.  He couldn't
resist, so he reached up with both hands and grabbed them.  He pinched both nipples and began rolling them between
his fingers.  He leaned forward and buried his face between Ayeka's beautiful, round tits.  Tenchi rubbed his face
up and down between her tits, trying to get more of that wonderful, musky odor into his >nostrils.  Tenchi licked

Brock: Musky odor? Does she bathe?
Erika: I have some perfumes I could sell her.

>the flesh between the fleshy mounds.  He pressed both of her pert breasts together close enough so her could get
both nipples in his mouth at the same time.  Tenchi bit them gently between his front teeth to keep them in his
mouth, at the same time he tugged on them slightly.  He began to flick his tongue across the both of her nipples.
Ayeka moaned out loud and continued to pound herself on to Tenchi's slick meat.

>	"Damn, your cunt is so tight Ayeka!" Tenchi managed to moan

George: F***, did we miss a scene?
Laronda: Looks that way. I’m not disappointed, either.

>	Tenchi grabbed either side of his lovers' hips to slow her down as they both approached orgasm.  Finally
Tenchi rammed his cock as far as it would go into Ayeka's warm depths as he shot his searing load of jizz up into
>her womb.  Her cunt muscles contracted in an effort to milk the cum out of his balls.

Erika: What is jizz? He keeps mentioning it. Is it a type of soda?
George: I could show you.
Erika: Never mind.

>	"Thank you Tenchi, you have proven to me how much you love me.  Now Ryouko can't take you away from me, 
ever!  You belong to me now.  But for now you must rest.  From the way you were acting earlier on in the evening,
>I'd say you were sick.  I'll be back to check on you later, to see that you are alright."

Laronda: Does she have a clue? Since when does all that prove love? And can she
be that naive?
George: What I want to know is how does he have all that stamina?
Brock: Must be Jurai power.
George: Possibly.

Laronda: Thank GOD. That was the most disgusting, amoral thing I’ve ever seen!
Erika: Me too.
George: You girls REALLY have to get out more often. This was pretty tame.
You all should have seen the carrot patch.
Brock: What was the Carrot Patch about anyway?
George: Four words. Tenchi, Sasami and Ryo-ohki.
( Erika faints )
Brock: Ten year old Sasami? You realize that that’s illegal, not to mention gross.
Laronda: Only you would have enjoyed that one, George.

>Well, that's all I have this time around.  If I can get enough ideas for a part 3 I'll do it.  If not I'll try doing
>another series.  

Laronda: Please don’t. I think we’ve had enough.
George: I wouldn’t mind seeing a part three.

>Stay tuned and feel free to send your comments and/ or ideas to >Mike_Forever@hotmail.com.

Laronda ( angrily ): I think I will. One thing puzzles me, though.
Brock: What?
Laronda: Usually, you go crazy when you see pretty women. What happened here?
Brock: Women like you and Erika, yes. Sluts like what I saw here, nope, sorry.
George: Come on now, you mean when you and Laronda are behind closed doors
you don’t ...
Brock: I’m telling you, you’re this close ...
( Erika comes to ) 
Erika: Are we still stuck?
Brock: Yep.
Erika: Well, what’s next?
