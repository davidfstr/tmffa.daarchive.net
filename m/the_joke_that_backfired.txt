This is just something I whipped off the top of my head to celebrate
April 1st.  Enjoy and beware.

     Ayeka nervously asked, "Ryoko, I know that Washu has done some bad
stuff to you, but do really think it's wise to mess with one of her
expiremnets?"

     Ryoko snorted, as she fiddled with a couple of dials, "I just want
to get her back for leaving be strung up like that after the Zero
incident.  I just want to see her reaction when she sees how her latest
creation turns out to be a total flop"

     Ayeka remained silent.

     Ryoko muttered, "Some of that blue creature, some of that purpule
one, and oh, yes:  The genetic code of Miki Momo."

     After a few seconds, Ryoko straightend up and said, "There, done."

     The two girls left Washu's lab.  Shortly after they did so, Washu
returned.

     "Hmmm.  Let's see.  I'd better finish the new experiment.  Wouldn't
want anyone to think that the number one genius scientist in the
universe was lazy.

  Washu actived her device.  Suddenly, warning sirens started blaring.
Rushing for the controls, Washu tried to stop the creature from forming.
It was to late.

     Upstairs, Ryoko was laughing to herself, when Washu went running
by.

     "It...it.....IT...," Washu was gibbering as she barreled past her
daughter.

     Ryoko turned and saw it.  It was wearing a fluoressecent orange
wedding dress.  It soon began to laugh and sing.

     "Hohohoh.  I smurf you.  You smurf me," The thing was singing. "Hi
there I'm Magical Princess Smurfy Barney."

     Ryoko stood in sugar shocked horror as the results of her joke came
towards her.

LET THE NIGHTMARES BEGIN!  HAHAHAHAHA
