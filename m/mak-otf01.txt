allow me to use Tenchi.

much too small.* : I'm going somewhere that I can get respect.

Yakuza *sweatdropping and defeated look* : Respected huh?
Washu *looking in background at Ryoko kissing Ayeka* : Look Yak-kun things

Tenchi : Yakuza I want a word.
Yakuza *now battered and in a hospital* : Great now Pionner are gonna make
sure that aswell as not having a leg to stand on physically I'll not have a
leg to stand on in court.
Tenchi : Actually I just wanted to say. This has been the worst fan fic ever
and you should be ashamed to post it on tmffa.com which is a great site
filled with class fics like Aikan Muyo and etc... and you suck.
Yakuza : am I supposed to argue with this?
Tenchi : Well there's something else *pulls out Tenchi-ken*
Yakuza *now panicing* : AIEEEE DON'T HURT ME.
Tenchi : I'm gonna destroy this fic before it gets any worse *uses the
Tenchi-ken to destroy rip through the fic and send everyone into the outer
realms of the internet*
Yakuza : NOOOOOO.

Okay now that I've had my fun and wasted some time etc I'll do something
important... honest. Read my fics- advert.

By the way Tenchi and co doesn't belong to me. Period.
