Always glad to see a fellow Monty Python fan. ^_^

Hmm...

Hmmmm....

"Emperor, eh? Well, *I* didn't vote for you."

"You don't vote for emperors."

"How'd you become Emperor, then?"

"My grandfather, Yosho, keeper of the Masaki shrine, said to me, 'Tenchi, 
I will give you that sword.' And I drew Tenchi-ken from the trunk of 
Funaho-ki, and it accepted me as its new master. *That* is why I am your 
emperor."

<piku piku> "Look, strange men hanging around shrines distributing swords 
is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives 
from a mandate from the masses, not some mystical arboreal ceremony."

"Be quiet!"

"You can't expect to wield *supreeeeeme* executive power just because some 
wizened coot threw a sword at you."

"Be quiet!!"

"Why, if I went around calling myself a shogun, just because some 
geriatric priest had lobbed a katana at me, they'd put me away!"...

"SHUT UP! WILL YOU SHUT UP!"


Hassheen!
