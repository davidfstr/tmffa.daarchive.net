Turtle of Love MST's episode 2:  Ancient Muyo



Another day.  Once again Nic and his cat Friskie eating.  Friskie I 

found a new story to MST.  What is it now. It's called Ancient Muyo.

"Sounds good" said Friskie.  So Nic and Friskie set off for another 

MST in their ship.

And now Nic and Friskie present

Ancient Muyo

(The seating order from left to right Nic and Friskie sitting on top 

of his chair)

Attention when Nic and Friskie talk in unisen instead of all it will say

N&F.  Thank You 

              Nic and Friskie ^_^

HI! It's me,

Nic: Hi

 and I've got something really dumb

Friskie: We knew that

 for you to check out! This is
just a silly script format fic about what it would be like if Tenchi never chose
a girl and the gang aged like normal humans!

N&F: Oh boy

 I wrote this on a message board, so
it's a bit silly and may have a few misspelled words, but I thought it was kinda
cute!

Friskie: Yeah right

So enjoy!

An aged Tenchi walks into his home, cane and all.

Nic: All includes diapers

Almost immediatly Ryoko rushes at a whole 2 mph

Friskie: Look at her go

 at Tenchi, bowling him over and
breaking her hip.

N&F: Ow

Ryoko: Oh, Tenchi! Come share a bottle of prune juice with me!

Nic: Out with the saki in with the prune juice

Aeka enters slowly, supported by her slightly younger sister.
Aeka (in a quiverring old lady voice): Ryoko! You leave Lord Tenchi alone!

Nic: (Ayeka) He's feeble

 Stop
trying to seduce him, you evil demon beast! Oh, my back!

Friskie: (Nelson from the simpsons) Haw haw

Washu walks in, a long gray beard

Nic: Eeww gross

 dangling to the floor and a big wooden cane in
one hand. She hits Aeka and Ryoko over the head with the wooden stick.

N&F: Da wooden stick WHAM

Washu: Everyone (cough) knows I'm (cough) the girl

Nic: You are not a girl you are OLD

 for (cough) Tenchi! (wheez)
I'm just so (cough) kawaii! (wheez, cough, sneeze)

Friskie: (Washu) Get the cough syrup

Mihoshi chooses this moment to cause an explosion in Washu's lab, causing the
scientist to have a heart attack and fall back on her butt, dead.

Nic: How about a moment of scilence

N&F: .......................................

Nobuyuki now enters in his wheel chair- a blanket on his lap and a camcorder

Friskie: It still works

 in
his hand.
Nob.: Oh, Tenchi! Smile!

Nic: Who's Nob

Ryoko is still lying on Tenchi since she broke her hip and cannot move. She
starts rubbing her saggy body

Nic: Eew Gross

 against Tenchi, elisiting a cry of horror from the
gray haired old man.
Tenchi: Ryoko! Stop it!

Friskie: (Tenchi) I'm dieing, no i mean it

 I need my medication! Get off of me! (snorts into a
hankerchief)

N&F: Eew gross

Aeka: You leave Lord Tenchi alone! I will destroy you!
Aeka now energizes her power logs, and prepares to trap Ryoko in a forcefield.
Aeka: Prepare to die!

Nic: (Ayeka) You will sooner or later

The logs come to life, giving Ryoko static cling. Then they dissapear and Aeka
wheezes from the strain.
Ryoko: Oh no... Now I need to use Snuggle! You know how much I hate those little
sheets! You'll pay princess!
Tenchi sweat drops.

Friskie: (Tenchi) I have not done that in 30 years

Ryo-Ohki now enters, limp-hopping up to Tenchi and begging for some mashed
carrots.

Friskie: (Sarcasticly) Yum

The entire house starts to rumble as *gasp*

Nic: Give yourself air man

 the Soja flies above the house. The
crippled form of Kagato materializes in front of Tenchi, and accidentally farts.

N&F: hahahhahhahhahahhahahhahahahahahaha

Kagato: Oooops... Anyway! Prepare to die, Tenchi! I have finally managed to
resurrect myself from death,

Nic: (Kagato) Thats tough

 and I will destroy you all! (Kagato now sneezes,
causing another fart to escape his body)

N&F: hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

 Damn medecine! I can't control my wind!
Tenchi sits up, Ryoko is now under Kagato's control. Ryoko manages to fire one
small ball of energy

Friskie: (sarcasticly) wow

 at Tenchi's foot before she has to go find some prune juice
for her bowels.

N&F: Gross

 Tenchi now has only one foot, which he uses to kick Kagato in
the knee. Kagato crumbles, farts sounding from his body as if he were a tuba.

N&F: hahahahahaha


Kagato: You may have (fart)

N&F: ha

 defeated me now- but (fart)

N&F: ha

 I will have my revenge
upon you! Beware the powers of Kagato, you foolish boy.. I mean old man! (fart,
fart, fart)

N&F: hahaha

Kagato then is beamed back up to the Soja, and makes his get away. Tenchi stands
on his one good foot, using dead Washu's

Nic: That is mean

 cane, and goes off to the kitchen to
make Ryo-Ohki some carrot mush.

N&F: (sarcasticly) Yum

~The End~
