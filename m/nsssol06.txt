Don't own nobody.  Y'all have fun now, y'ear?

MST#6  Ctarl-Ctarl's not allowed.

<Ranma> (screaming, covering his eyes) STOP!
 <JS> (at a computer) What?  It's not all that bad.
 <Ranma> YES IT IS!
 <JS> Geez, all it is is Nabiki finding some pictures of your female 
form masturbating and then forcing you to have sex with her since you 
don't have any money, not to mention your still a female.  Nothing to 
scream about.
<Ranma> STOP READING THAT DOUJINSHI!
<JS> (ignoring him) Ooh…
<Ranma> THEN AT LEAST STOP READING IT TO ME!			     <JS> 
Ooh, Nabiki in a nasty black teddie.  Rwoar…
<Ranma> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP!
<JS> She's moving in for the kill…
<Ranma> ARE YOU CRAZY?!
 <JS> She's inches away…
<Ranma> WWWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!
<JS> Houston we have lesbians.
 <Ranma> AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH! (passes out)
 <JS> (eyes go wide) Wow. (turns to Ranma) Hey Ranma, can your body 
bend like that in either form…huh? (notices he has passed out with a 
sliver of blood running down his nose) Hmm, never thought he'd do the 
"nose bleed" gag. (continues to click and read) Nabiki seems to be the 
favorite for lesbian scenarios, I wonder why.
 <Asuka> (comes in) Whatcha' lookin…never mind.
 <Ryoko> (also comes in, shakes Ranma) Congratulation, you've 
traumatized Ranma.
<JS> He's seen worse.  I'm sure he's fine
 <Vegetta> (looks over JS's shoulder) Is that Nabiki in a black teddie?
 <Others> VEGETTA!
 <Vegetta> Uh…um…I mean, you idiot! (punches JS in the head)
 <Jim> (through speakers) We got trouble guys, I need you in the 
theater.
 <Ryoko> (picks Ranma up) What could be worse than viewing bad fanfics?
 <Vegetta> (following her) Viewing horrible fanfics.
 <Asuka> (grabs JS's ear) Move it!
 <JS> Ow!  Asuka, I didn't do anything!

(Regular seating order)				 				       
<JS> What's the matter Jim?
 <Jim> I was going through the computer archives, when a story was 
automatically uploaded.
 <Others>……………So?
 <Jim> We didn't even plan this one.
 <Ryoko> But what doe it mean?
 <Jim> It means that we have been sent a fic without our consent and I 
fear that someone may have infiltrated our computer mainframe and is 
controlling the fics we view.  <Others> (look like they're thinking 
hard) Mmm-hmm.
 <Jim> (bursting) IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT FIC THIS IS, AND 
WE HAVE NO CONTROL ON WHO'S SENDING IT!
 <Others> Oh.
 <Vegetta> Why didn't you say that in the first place?
 <Jim> (vein popping) I did.
 <Ryoko> Well that's good.  We don't have any control over it so we 
don't have to watch it either.  Right? 
<Others except Jim> Right.
 (Before they go out the door several dozen guns come down from the 
ceiling and block their path)
 <Jim> (nervously) Wrong.
 <Asuka> (stares horrified, tugs on JS's shirt) When did you install 
those?
 <JS> (rubs his chin while looking into the air) December thirteenth, 
two-thousand and one, at five thirty five P.M.
 <Vegetta> (stares unamused) This is nothing a saiyan can't destroy.
 <JS> I hate to burst your bubble Vegetta, but those bullets can go 
through five fourth level super-saiyan's skin.  You wouldn't survive.
 <Vegetta> (glares at him) I hate you, you know that?
 <Jim> By the way, we have also lost control of the defense 
mechanism's.
<JS> (notices everyone glaring at him) Jim, try to restore order, we'll 
watch the fic.
 
> This fanfic is not sutable for immature people. If you are not at an 
mature age please >don't read this fanfic. 

<Asuka> Well then he's going to be pretty pissed about this MST.
 <JS> That's the point.  You MST a fanfic, the author usually gets mad, 
unless they didn't like the story themselves.

>Summary: Mihoshi wins tickets on the radio for a romantic dinner after 
a movie. She >invite's Tenchi to go and well you can guesse the rest.

<Ryoko> (sarcastically yet angerily) No, I can't, give me a hint.

>Mihoshi was in her room typing her report for her galaxy police job and 
listing to the >radio.

<JS> (singing) Who let the dogs out?!
 <Others> (ditto) Woof!  Woof, woof woof!
 <Ryoko> (as Mihoshi) I LOVE this song!
 <Vegetta> She would.
 
>"The next person to call our station will win 2 tickets to "Flesh 
Eatter 2"

<All> "Flesh Eatter 2?"

> and a dinner after the movie with a limo ride. 

<Ranma> (sarcastically) Real romantic.  A horror movie and then dinner.
 <Ryoko> That'd have to be one hell of a dinner to make me go.

>You might want to invite someone special to go with you if you know 
what I mean. Just >be the 9th caller on our Dinner and Movie Weekend."

<JS> (to Ryoko) Do you remember a radio show like that Ryoko?	
<Ryoko> Can't say I have.  I don't even remember a radio in the house.

>"Oh wow! 2 tickets to see "Flesh Eatter 2". Mihoshi said.

<JS> Now for some rants (goes through a clipboard) Um, when you write a 
story, you spell out the numbers and I think there's only one 't' in 
Eater.
<Asuka> (sarcastically) Thank you sooo much.
 <Ryoko> What's your problem?
 <Asuka> I have a feeling this isn't the first mistake.

>"GIVE ME THAT PHONE!" Ayeka said

>Mihoshi heard all the noise and went down stairs to cheak it out.

<Vegetta> Ow, that hurts.
 <Ranma> How can you misspell 'check'?

>"I'm the one who's gonna win those tickets. Not you princess." Ryoko 
said

<Asuka> Without any punctuation.

>"You just want a moment along with Tenchi, but your not gonna get it. I 
am!" Ayeka >said

<Ryoko> Who's moment?
 <JS> How many threesome fics are we gonna review in a row? (everyone 
glares at him) What?
 <Asuka> The 'g' isn't even close to the 'e' key.

>Mihoshi took out her pocket her cell phone and diled the radio number 
and it began to >ring.

<All> "Her pocket her cell phone?"
 <Ryoko> When did Mihoshi have a cell phone?
 <Vegetta> Probably won it on a radio show contest.

>"Give me the phone Ryoko!" Ayeka yelled

>"Never! Tenchi and me were ment to be." Ryoko yelled

<JS> I think we have confirmed that this guy cannot spell.
 <Ranma> Or use punctuation marks.

>"Oh Wow!" Mihoshi yelled

>"Huh?" Ryoko and Ayeka looked at each other weirdly

<JS> (as Ryoko) Are you getting as turned on as I am?
 <Vegetta> (as Ayeka) Even more so.
*KLONG!*
 *BLAM!*

>"I won!" Mihoshi said

>"Yes baby you won!" Joey the DJ said.

(Others stare at JS nervously)
 <JS> My name just happens to be the popular name around here.
 <Others> But this is Japan.
 <JS> (sweatdrop) Well…big deal!  It isn't me!	
<Asuka> Yeah, you're right.  If it was you, you'd force her to take you.
 <JS> (turns to camera) She knows me so well, that's why we're meant to 
be.
<Vegetta> (ditto) And that is how you spell meant.
 
> "You get to have a Dinner and Movie. You will see your movie at the 
Tajahita Cinama 

<All> "Tajahita Cinama?"
 <Ryoko> Do we want to know what Tajahita means?
 <JS> Better question, do we want to know what this guy was doing when 
he wrote this?
<Vegetta> Getting ahead of himself.
 <Others> (turning green) Thank you Vegetta.

>and have a wonderful dinner at Shogun.

<Lime> (from the back of the theater) Shogun!  Shogun!  Shogun!  Shogun!
 (Others look in the back of the theater nervously but no one's there)

> You can come pick up the tickets at the station. You know where it 
is?"

>"Do I ever!" Mihoshi said

<Ryoko> I guess she did win the cell phone, although I'd like to know 
where we have a radio.

>"Ok! See ya then!" Joey said and hung up

>"MIHOSHI!" Ryoko and Ayeka said. "You have to give me the tickets!"

>"No Way! I may be silly and clumsy but I'm not stupid." 

<Asuka> (sarcastic) And Britany Spears isn't a whore.

>Mihoshi said running upstairs as Ryoko and Ayeka was chasing her.

>"No! Get away!" Mihoshi said.

<JS> That may work for Maze, but this show is a little better than that.

>Mihoshi was running so fast she didn't see Tenchi standing there and 
crashed into him.

>"Whoa! Mihoshi what's the rush?" Tenchi said

>Ayeka and Ryoko was coming at them really fast. Mihoshi grabed Tenchi's 
arm and >pulled them into Sasami's room.

<JS> This guy definently needs a dictionary.
 <Asuka> Or at least half-a-brain.

>"Come out of there with Tenchi!" Ryoko yelled banging on the door.

>"What do they want?" Tenchi said scared half to death.

<JS> (as Mihoshi/Dracula) They vant, your vlood…vlah.
 <Vegetta> (gives two thumbs down) Lame.

>"Don't make me come in there!" Ayeka yelled tring to get the door open.

<Vegetta> Well Ryoko, it's nice to know that you and Ayeka have been 
crowned "The Supreme Bitches" in this fanfic.
 <Ryoko> Bite me.  Just because I'm not the most innocent person in the 
world.

>"They want my tickets that I won on the radio and I don't even have 
them yet." Mihoshi >said turning red. "Do you wanna go with me to see 
"Flesh Eatters 2?"

<Ryoko> (as Tenchi) No, I love Ryoko.  Go away.
 <JS> (pats her on the back) You're just going to have to wait until the 
third OVA's come out.
 <Ryoko> Everyone knows I already have it won, why won't they just give 
me the prize now?

>"Sure." Tenchi said. "Does this weekend sound good?"

<JS> She's the one with the tickets, why should you make the 
arrangements?

>"Oh Yeah! I'm off duty so I'll be free." Mihoshi said happy and full of 
joy. "Thank you >Tenchi." Mihoshi gave Tenchi a long kiss on the lips. 
"It's a reward. See ya tonight."

<Ryoko> (in shock) A REWARD?!   FOR WHAT?!  GIVING HIM A HARD-ON?!
<Ranma> So the weekend just came up on them like that?
 <Asuka> Neither the author or Tenchi has no perception of time.

>Mihoshi opened the door and Ryoko and Ayeka fell throgh the door and 
Mihoshi bolted >out the door and throgh the frount door.

(Everyone tries to pronounce the last sentence)
 <Vegetta> Would that be –ount or –oont?
 <Asuka> Throgh?  Is that how it sounds with a lisp?

> Mihoshi took a short cut to get to the city.  Tenchi wasn't living 
very far from the 
>station.

<Ryoko> I don't remember living anywhere near a city.
 <Vegetta> And unless you can fly there is no possible way to take a 
shortcut.

>*That Night*


>"Mihoshi! Please! I'll do anything for those tickets." Ayeka said in 
Mihoshi's bedroom >while she was getting ready in the bathroom.

<All> What?!
 <Ryoko> This guy has remodeled my house!
 <JS> It is official.  The author has no idea what the hell he's talking 
about.

>"No Miss Ayeka. This is really important to me." Mihoshi said. "I 
always wanted to go >on a date."

>Mihoshi grabed the make up kit next to her.

<JS> You don't need make-up, trust me.

>"But, loving lord Tenchi has always been a fantasy of mine and well, I 
would really like >the tickets." Ayeka said making fake tears.

<Ryoko> Listen, me and Ayeka don't get along all the time, but when she 
cries…she cries, there's nothing fake about it.
 <Vegetta> (making fake tears) That was so sweet Ryoko.
 <Ryoko> Shut up.

>"No. Now it's Ryoko's turn to give me a good reason why I should give 
you the tickets." >Mihoshi said

<Ryoko> Nooo.  I'd be giving you good reason's to give ME the ticket.
 <Ranma> He can't use proper pronouns either.

>Ryoko teleported into the room.

>"Mihoshi? You would really like a promotion right?" Ryoko said slyly. 
"Well, I >promuse to turn myself in if you give me the tickets."

<Ryoko> Promuse…promuse…
<JS> @_@ Head…dizzy…spin…spin…spin….

>"Ok. I've heard enough." Mihoshi said. "I'm gonna be late If I don't 
hurry."

<Vegetta> Wait a minute!  Didn't she go to the city already?!
 <Ranma> He doesn't even know where they are!
 <JS> (his head starts doing that Beetlegeuse head spin) A-A-A-A-A-A-A-
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A! (grabs head 
causing him to stop) Woah…
<Others> O_O;;
 <Ryoko> How the hell did he do that?
 <Vegetta> Don't know, don't want to know.

>"Gr! Mihoshi! Give me the tickets!" Ryoko yelled

>"No. Now I have to go or I'll be late." Mihoshi grabed her spagettie 
strap purse and ran >out of the room.

<Asuka> The man tried to spell spaghetti.  He must have had a stroke.

> Tenchi was down stairs waiting for Mihoshi.

>"I'm ready!" Mihoshi said

>Mihoshi was wearing a min-skirt with a shirt with a small star on it.

<Ryoko> Why couldn't it have been a max-skirt?
 <Ranma> Is this guy related to Tank Cop?!
 <JS> I wouldn't be surprised.

>"Wow....Mihoshi...You look great." Tenchi said studdring.

<Vegetta> He has to be related.  There's no other possible explanation.

>"Thanks a lot Tenchi...Now come on! We'll be late for the movie and we 
have a limo >waiting for us."

>Mihoshi ran down stairs and grabed Tenchi's hand and ran out the front 
door.

>"Have fun you 2." Tenchi's Dad said. "Nothing frisky now. Ha ha ha."

<JS> Isn't the slogan "Nothing but Friskies?" (others stare at him 
nervously) What?

>The limo was at least 20-30 feet long. Ryoko and Ayeka was glaring at 
Mihoshi and >Tenchi getting in the limo.

>"Come on Tenchi." Mihoshi said. "The limo won't bite."

<All> I sure hope not!
<Vegetta> I think those two are the only ones going to do the biting 
around here.

>Tenchi steped in and saw the whole limo.

<Ranma> Oh my God!  He used the right 'whole.'  Maybe he isn't related.

> It had green carpeting and the walls were lepor-spotted

<Ranma> I could have been wrong.

>, and wine on  the mini-bar in front of him. The drivers window was 
raised down. >Mihoshi's pretty blue eyes glisned at the luxiory and 
beutiful suroundings.

<JS> (grabs his chest) OH-OH MY HEART! (passes out)
 <Asuka> Oh great!  He's gone into cardiac arrest!  The spelling finally 
got to him.
<Ranma> Who knows CPR?
 <Others> (quickly) I don't.
 <Ranma> (sweatdrop) Fine, Asuka, give him the "Kiss of Life."
 (Others stare at him nervously)
 <Asuka> You do know that "Kiss of Life" is another saying for CPR?
 <Ranma> JUST DO IT!
 (Asuka groans a little, then kisses him on the lips.  He shoots 
straight up)
<JS> Hello.
 <Asuka> (wiping mouth) He's awake, now give me some chapstick.

>"Wow Tenchi! Isn't this romantic." Mihoshi said

>"Yeah." Tenchi said still looking at everything.

>"You guys ready?" The driver said. "The movie starts in 10min."
 
<JS> When you're writing a story, you don't abbreviate what the 
character is saying.

>"Wow we better get going." Mihoshi said.

>The driver started the engine and rolled up the little window to leave 
Mihoshi and >Tenchi in private.

<Vegetta> (as Tenchi) So uh…what do we do know?
 <Asuka> (as Mihoshi) I think this is where I take off my pants.

>"So...What's the movie about?" Tenchi said scooting closer to Mihoshi.

>"Well, I don't want to give it away." Mihoshi said slyly. "But you'll 
find out."

<Ryoko> If it's anything like Overfriend, we're all dead.

>"Oh..Ok." Tenchi said. "My friends say it's a pretty scary movie.

>"Oh it is." Mihoshi said with a excited face. "Its tearing up the box 
office.

<Ryoko> Tenchi's friends, or the movie?
 <JS> Has to be the movie, Tenchi doesn't have any friends outside you 
and…maybe it was his friends.

> The Tajahita Cinama is the coolest! They have suround sound and a huge 
screen. 

<Vegetta> (sarcastic) Really?  I thought a CINEMA was a portable TV with 
those speakers you hook up to it.

>I went there with Kiyone to see the Police Policeman Movie."

<All>…………………
<JS> Police Policeman…this is Shin…we are officially in Hell.
 (A large figure with red and black skin walks by the group holding his 
hands out)
<Devil> Souls?  Will work for souls.  Souls anyone? (JS shakes his head) 
You ma'am…do you have a spare soul? (Asuka shakes her head) Will work 
for souls. (walks off-screen, others stare nervously at JS)
 <Ryoko> Just because you got the Diablo game for Christmas doesn't mean 
you have to bring HIM in here.
 <JS> (turns to camrea; to readers) You thought it was funny…didn't you?

>Mihoshi then discovered she was acting like a little kid waiting to go 
on a rollercoaster >for the first time.

>"I'm sorry. I'm acting like a little kindergardener." Mihoshi said 
blushing of >imbrassment.

<Ranma> That is not a typo folks…the 'i' and 'e' are on the other side 
of the keyboard.
<JS> To all Tank Cop's and Loreal "Mihoshi" Miller's…IT'S EMBARASSMENT!  
THAT'S HOW YOU SPELL IT!

>"It's ok Mihoshi." Tenchi said "I understand. That's what I like about 
you. Your so >carefree unlike the other girls. Well, maybe Sasami."

>"Really?" Mihoshi said. "You really like me?"

>"Well, yeah!" Tenchi said. "You can put it that way."

>"Wow!" Mihoshi said. "No ones ever had a crush on me before."

(Everone face-faults)
 <JS> If Tenchi isn't picking himself up from a face-fault after that, 
this story is officially crap.
 <Asuka> Hmm…(turns to camera) Attention folks, the "Word of the Day," 
is 'officially'!
 <JS> Just because I like that word…

>"Wait that's not what I mean." Tenchi said with a swet drop from his 
>head.

<Ryoko> He can't even spell sweatdrop right…this is inhuman.

> "I mean I like you the way you are not like..well you know."

<All> "I mean I like you the way you are not like?"
 <JS> I think I have found today's stinger.
 
>Mihoshi was staring at Tenchi for a while and looked kinda upset. "It's 
ok Tenchi." >Mihoshi said putting on her carefree face.

>The limo then stopped and pulled up to the entrance of the theather.

>"Where here!" The driver said.

<All>……………
<Ranma> (horrified) He used where instead of we're…that means that 
he's…he's…HE'S TANK COP IN DISGUISE!
<All> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

>The driver got out of the car and opened the door. As Tenchi and 
Mihoshi stepped out >there were cameras flashing and TV crews everywere.

<Vegetta> (as reporter) Tenchi Masaki!  How do you feel about the 
aligation's that you have been put into a disguised Tank Cop fic?!
 <Ryoko> (as reporter) Mihoshi!  Is it true that Ryoko and Ayeka are 
going to severely maim you when you get home?!
 <JS> (as Tenchi and Mihoshi's lawyer) No questions…please.

>"Mihoshi! What's going on?" Tenchi said covering his face from the 
flashes of the >cameras.

>"I almost forgot to tell you." Mihoshi said also being blinded by the 
cameras. "I'm in the >movie!

(Everyone face-faults)
<JS> That's usually crucial information when going on a date.
<Vegetta> What's her part anyway?  Is she Fleah Eater? Oh, I'm 
sorry…Flesh EATTER!

> I play one of the people running from the Flesh Eatters."

<Asuka> All those camera's are there because you run away for a couple 
minutes?
<JS> Hell, if that's what you have to do to get publicity, I'm there!

>"So Mihoshi." A news woman said getting right in front of her face. 
"Who's your little >friend?"

(Everyone but Ryoko starts snickering)
<Vegetta> So they know about Tenchi's problem too?
<JS> This is Mihoshi…she doesn't know what she's saying sometimes.

>"I rather not talk about it." Mihoshi said. She grabed Tenchi's arm and 
ran throgh the >crowed of desperate news people. They ran throgh the 
entance and closed the door >keeping the crazy reporters and fans out.

<JS> Peter and Ksa would be having heart attack's right around now.  I 
already did…I think.

>"Whew!" Mihoshi said. "I'm sorry I forgot to tell you I was in the 
movie. We have 5min >til the movie starts."

>"We better hurry." Tenchi said. "Too bad we won't be able to get 
popcorn."

<Asuka> (as Mihoshi) Oh I'll think we'll be popping our own corn in the 
theater. (Ryoko glares at her)

>"Were having a dinner after this." Mihoshi said giggling. "We don't 
want to spoil it."

>"Oh yeah!" I almost forgot." Tenchi said.

>"Come on!" Mihoshi said "This way." Tenchi and Mihoshi ran down and 
empty hall and >ran into the movie. They found a good seat right in back 
with a perfect view and >everything.

<Vegetta> Meaning they only got a perfect view.

>"We made it just in time!" Mihoshi said sitting in the seat right in 
the middle. "It's just >starting."

>Tenchi sat in the seat right next to Mihoshi.

>"Look!" Mihoshi whispred. "There's me. It took about 20 takes just to 
get this part >because I kept falling, triping or knocking things over."

<Ryoko> Twenty takes, really?  I thought they would be in the hundreds 
at least.

>Tenchi could hardly belive Mihoshi was right there on the screen. She 
was walking into >the kitchen and saw a dead man on the floor with a 
knife in his chest.

<Ranma> (as man on floor)  Um, could you remove this please?

>"AAAAHHH!" Mihoshi's charactor screamed. "Kashito! Oh My God! What 
>happened?" 

<Vegetta> No way.  They got her in character in a movie?

>Mihoshi's charator ran to the phone and picked it up to call 911. 

<JS> I think we've about had it for misspellings and understudied plots.

>Then someone from behind her grabbed her and had a knife in his hand.

>"Hello Kira! You tried to kill me." The man said. "Now I will kill 
you."

>"Get away!" Kira said and hit the killer in the head with the phone and 
ran upstairs. >Then the killer was already upstairs and grabbed Mihoshi 
by the arm and threw her >agenst the wall.

<Ranma> (as killer) I will kill you for making me misspell my 
adjectives.

>"Ahhhh!" The crowed screamed.

<All> "Yawn" the MSTrs did.

> Mihoshi was holding on to Tenchi's arm. Even though she's seen the 
movie before.

>"Please! No get away!" Kira screamed. The killer rasied the knife and 
stabbed Kira in >the shouder. Kira screamed and sled to to the floor as 
Kira was crying in pain. The killer >then got a gun and pointed it at 
Kira then a huge german shepered named Ryoohki >(Mihoshi came up with 
the name of the dog.) 

<Ryoko> (sarcastic) Gee, I wonder where she got it off of.

>grabbed the killer by the hand and got shot in the ear as the dog fell 
to the ground with a >yelp Kira had time to get away.

<JS> The run-ons!  The horrible run-ons! 

***********************************************

>"I'm just glad the whole thing is over" Kira said to her dog Ryoohki as 
the bodie of the >killer was floating down the river and into the sea.

<Ranma> Woah!  What happened?!  Where'd we go?!
<JS> This…this had nothing to do with Flesh Eaters…what…what?
<Asuka> (patting him on the back) Smoke's coming out of your ears, calm 
down.

>"Wow Mihoshi!" Tenchi said with an impressed look. "You act really 
great."

<Vegetta> (as Tenchi) You're also a good actress too.

>"Thanks Tenchi." Mihoshi said blushing again. "It was just a hobbie. 

<Ranma> It isn't a hobby…it's a career!

>Come on let's get back to the limo." Tenchi and Mihoshi took the other 
exit to avoid >being attacked by reporters. Mihoshi whisled to the limo 
driver to srive to where they >were. The plan worked with flying colors 
and they were off to Shogun. 

<Lime> (from back of theater) Shogun!  Shogun!  Shogun!
(Others turn around quickly but no one's there)

>"What did you think of the movie Tenchi?" Mihoshi asked.

>"It was great Mihoshi!" Tenchi said. "I never thought you could act so 
good. Did you do >your own stunts."

>"Well, most of them but not all." Mihoshi said "I did the jumping off 
the expolding >building.

<Ryoko> How does a building expold?
<JS> (throws finger in air) With a lot of practice!
(Everyone starts laughing)

> I did the knife one and I did the gun one and the motercycle chase. It 
was my fav."

<Asuka> So basically she's a dumb, blonde, female, Jackie Chan.

>Tenchi was so impressed of how Mihoshi did all that stuff. Tenchi was 
getting a little >edgey and had a tingling feeling in the lower area.

<JS> (as Tenchi) I…I must do…the Twist!

> He was horny and wanted to get Mihoshi in bed.

<All>……………
<Vegetta> This guy really wanted to get to…the"good stuff."
<Ryoko> (turns to camera) And we all know what the "good stuff" is.

> Tenchi looked at Mihoshi on the other side of the limo looking out the 
window so >inoccent and carefree. Tenchi looked at her breast and felt 
even hornyer. 

<Ranma> I just noticed he's replacing the y's and the ie's in the words.
<JS> He has to be Tank Cop…he has to be.

>He stopped and said to him self to wait till she's tired and weak then 
ask her.

<Vegetta> Tenchi?!  Wait until she's tired and weak?!
<JS> The movie must have really gotten to him.

>Tenchi and Mihoshi's dinner was great. Tenchi had 3 Sakis in a row! 
Mihoshi had 5!

<All> (sarcastic) WHOOP-DI-DOO!
<Asuka> Fifteen!
<Ranma> Twenty!
<Ryoko> Thirty!
<JS> Twenty four and a half!
<Vegetta> (passively) One…hundred.
(Everyone starts clapping for Vegetta)

> They had hamburger stake and krapes for dinner along with some shrimp 
and miso >soup.

<Ranma> (twitching) He misspelled steak…I'm gonna kill him.  And crepes…
<Asuka> Stand back, I think Ranma's going to have a heart attack.
<Ranma> (gripping chest; faintly) I'm okay…I'm okay…

> Mihoshi and Tenchi was being a little to loud and they had to be 
thrown out. It was >embarassing but it was cool.

<Vegetta> That's great.  They did the lemon scene without showing us!  
Time to go!
<Others> Sit down.

>"Wow! Tenchi I had a great time!" Mihoshi said yelling.  Tenchi had to 
carry her to the >limo because she was drunk.

<Asuka> One of the few times he spells an entire sentence correctly and 
she's drunk.

> Tenchi was half drunk but he managed.

<JS> To what, we don't ever want to know.

> Tenchi sat her in the limo and Mihoshi had some coffie to calm her 
nerves. 

<Ryoko> COFFEE is full of caffine!  It's supposed to speed you up.
<Asuka> Which is not a good thing at this point in the fic.

>The driver raised up the little window and drove out the lot of the 
resturant.

>"Mihoshi? Are you ok?" Tenchi said waking her up.

>"Yeah. I'm alright." I feel kind of imbrassed. I'm sorry." 

<Vegetta> She must be embarrassed from using an extra quotaion mark.

>"Mihoshi!" Tenchi said grabbing her arm. "I lied."

<JS> (as Tenchi) I'm gay!
<Vegetta> (as Mihoshi) Oh everybody knew that already.
(Ryoko blasts both of them)

>Mihoshi cocked her head in counfusion. "About what?" 

<Ranma> Doesn't she look like a dog listening to a high-pitched whine?
(Sounds of agreement all around)

>"I really....I really do love you." Tenchi said with a little imbrassed 
look. "I really have a >crush on you and I can admet that."

<Asuka> (as Tenchi) However I can't admit it.

>"Tenchi I-" Mihoshi was starting to cry. "Tenchi I want to have sex 
with 
>you!" 

(Everyone face-faults)
<Ryoko> (getting up) Where the hell did that come from?!
 <Asuka> THAT, is what I call pulling shit from your ass and calling it 
gold.
(Others stare at her nervously)

>Mihoshi quickly covered her mouth. "I'm sorry."

>"Mihoshi." Tenchi said with a very serious voice. "I will."

<Vegetta> He went for romantic, but overshot and hit crap.
<JS> You just don't go out and say, "Hey I got an idea!  Let's have 
sex!" if you want to make a romantic scene.  This is what you have to 
do. (gets down on one knee and holds Asuka's hand) Will you make love to 
me?
(Asuka glares at him, then punches him in the face)
<JS> (getting back up, couple teeth missing) You can even make a comedy 
out of it!

>Mihoshi went over to Tenchi and kissed him on the lips. Tenchi was 
supised how good >she was at kissing.

<Ryoko> I don't think you have to be a rocket scientist to be good at 
kissing.
<JS> (looks over at Asuka and smiles) I'm sure Asuka found that out the 
hard way.
(She blushes and looks away from him)

> Mihoshi and Tenchi fell to the floor. Their kissing lasted for a 
minute.

<Vegetta> (sarcastic) Oh wow, a whole minute!  Bulma and me go at it for 
at least…
<Ranma> (holding up hand) Vegetta, please.  I don't think we're in the 
mood.

> Then Mihoshi sat up and unbuttoned Tenchi's jacket and took off his 
shirt. Then Tenchi >took a hold of Mihoshi's breast.

<Ryoko> (as Mihoshi) Hang on, this is going to be a bumpy ride.
(Others stare at her nervously)
<JS> (twirling finger around) And, who's the one who is madly in love 
with him?
<Ryoko> Just because Ayeka can't handle it over at Animeport #9, doesn't 
mean that I can't. 
*KKKKKKKKKKKKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK
!*
<Vegetta> (looks at watch) More than halfway through.  She does have 
some self-control.

> Mihoshi giggled and took off her shirt and there was her bra.

<JS> Marvel at her bra.
<All> (sarcastically) Oooooooooooooooooooooo…

> It was pink with a little flower in the middle. Tenchi went to the 
back of her bra  and >tried to unbuckle it. Mihoshi took her hands in 
the front where the buckle was and undid >it and it came completely off.

<Vegetta> And so did Tenchi.
<Ryoko> Shut up.

> Mihoshi then turned around and kissed Tenchi again. Then Tenchi 
started to pull down >her skirt. There was her white thin panties as 
Tenchi put his hands on her hip he slowly >pulled them down. 

<JS> Run-ons…oh the horrible run-ons.

>Tenchi got on top of Mihoshi and started kissing her and rubing her 
large breast. >Mihoshi began to moan in plesure. 

<JS> Big deal, I can make Asuka moan in pleasure. (smiles at her)	
*KLONG!*

>Tenchi then went down to her breast and started to lick and nibble on 
her nipples. 

<Vegetta> Nibble on her nipples?  That's new to me.
<Ranma> And he's the veteran in here.
 
>Mihoshi was moan withe pleasure really loud.

(Everyone looks over the last line)
<JS> I got nothing.
<Asuka> I'm out too.

> "Tenchi...Oh...My." Mihoshi said that over and over again. Then Tenchi 
put is finger in >her vagina and started to rub it back and forth. 
Mihoshi was moaning a little louder now >and rubbing her hair. Tenchi 
then took his finger and stuck it up her peehole.

<All> HER WHAT?!
<Ryoko> (lits up her kimono) Isn't it the same thing?!
<Asuka> This man hasn't passed sex-ed, and HE'S WRITING A LEMON?!
<Ranma> How do you know this isn't a woman?!
<JS> Oh!  I think a woman would know better than to call it, a 
"peehole"!
<Ryoko> AND, a woman would know that it is, the SAME THING!
<JS> (turns to camera) Loreal, this is bad.  I mean horrible bad.  But I 
do praise you for not turning this into "Sammy's Little Secret." 

 >Mihoshi was almost screaming this time. Tenchi pulled it in and out 
faster and faster. >"Oh.....Oh....Keep..going....Oh." Mihoshi said 
rubbing her breast to the rhythm of >Tenchi rubbing her vagina. 

<JS> Oh yeah?  Well try keeping in sync with this. (pulls out a drumset, 
and starts playing "Wipe out!"  Everyone hits him upside the head)

>Then they stopped. Mihoshi sat up and wrapped her arms around Tenchi. 
It was his 
>turn.

<Vegetta> (as Tenchi) Can I use a lifeline?

> Mihoshi then began to kiss him and then went down to his chest and 
>started to lick his nipples. 

<All> o_O;;

>Tenchi began to moan and rub Mihoshi's hair as she nibbled on them.

<Vegetta> Um…I'm sorry, but that's not very pleasurable for a man…at 
least a sane one.

> Then Mihoshi made her way down to Tenchi's cock and began to lick it. 
Tenchi was >moaning with pain and pleasure.

<Asuka> (makes a crunching sound) *CRUNCH!*
(All the guys pass out, Ryoko gives her a high-five)

> Mihoshi then got to his penis and began to suck it. Tenchi was holding 
the seat very >tightly as Mihoshi was sucking his cock and putting it 
down her throat. Tenchi was >cuming her down her thoat and Mihoshi was 
swollowing every bit of it.

<JS> You have to be really flexible if you can cum her down her…
*KLONG!*

> Tenchi was cumming her so much she could hardly swllow it all and took 
Tenchi's >penis out. and cum was going all over the floor.

<Ranma> (as chaufeur) Hey!  Hey hey hey!  I ain't payin' to clean that 
up!

> Then Tenchi stopped cumming and fell back and Mihoshi fainted. The 
driver had >stopped and they were at the house and Ryoko and Ayeka was 
waiting at the front >porch.

<Ryoko> That was quick.
<JS> Faster than Mashymer, (that's The Assassin) with a johnson.
<Ranma> (turns to camera) Yes folks, that was an entire paragraph.  From 
"Mihoshi turned to Tenchi," all the way to, "at the front porch."

>"OH NO!" Tenchi yelled. He quickly scarmbled to put his pants and 
underwear on. >"Mihoshi wake up!" Tenchi yelled. The driver knocked on 
the window and asked if they >were ready.

<JS> (as Tenchi) We just finished a quickie, we'll be a minute.

>"No not yet." Tenchi said. "Don't open the door yet." Tenchi tried to 
dress Mihoshi >while she was passed out. But it was too late Ryoko and 
Ayeka was running for the >limo!

(Ryoko starts humming the theme to Indiana Jones)

>"Oh no." Tenchi tried hard to find out how the bra got on.

<Vegetta> It isn't a rubix cube kid.

> He finnaly mastered it.

<Ranma> To Tenchi, it's more or less is.

> Tenchi then tured around and locked the limo door. Tenchi then put 
Mihoshi's panties >on. Then he put her shirt and her skirt on and 
signaled the driver to open the door.

<Ryoko> Like jumping into the lion's den.

> He pick Mihoshi up and put his jacket on her cause she was shivering. 
The driver >opened the door and Ayeka and Ryoko tackled Tenchi to the 
ground while he was >holding Mihoshi.

<JS> (as football announcer) And there's a fumble on the field!

>"Tenchi! I'm so glad your back!" Ryoko and Ayeka said together.

>"Hey! Get off me your crushing Mihoshi not including me!" Tenchi said 
trying to get >them off of him.

<Asuka> And trying not to use comma's within his sentence.

>"I'm sorry Tenchi!" The girls said.

>"Back off Princess!" Ryoko said. "How many times do I have to tell you 
that Tenchi is >mine and always will be."

<Ryoko> (flips through clipboard) Let's see, fifty five thou-
<Vegetta> We get the point Ryoko.

>"I don't see your name on him so back off." Ayeka said.

>Tenchi had enough time to escape with Mihoshi. He opened the other door 
and snuck >out of the limo. He stud up with Mihoshi in his hands and 
walked into the house. 

<Asuka> No matter how hard you try Tenchi, you'll never be a stud.
(Ryoko shoots a glare towards her)

>Everyone was asleep so he sat Mihoshi on the couch cause he didn't want 
to wake >Kiyone. Then he kissed Mihoshi good-night and went to his room.

<JS> Is that the end?!  Is it finally the end?!
<Ryoko> I believe so.
<Jim> Just some author's notes.  Nothing big.

>There's no second chapter to this beacause it wouldn't make any sence 
however,

<JS> This one didn't even make sense, but I thank you for not 
continuing.

> There will be one for the others but a lot better then Mihoshi's. 
She's my fav character >and I screwed it up. I'll try to make another 
one.

<Vegetta> If you value your health, you won't.

>UPDATE: I will make 2 more lemons One is called Sakuya's Best and 
Nobiyuki the >Rapest

<All>…………………
<Ryoko> Nobiyuki…the…rapest…
<Asuka> (grabs JS's collar) Please tell me I didn't read that…(shakes 
him violently) TELL ME I DIDN'T READ THAT!
<JS> (eyes never leaving the screen) You didn't read that.
<Asuka> (shakes him furiously) THEN HOW COME IT'S ON THE SCREEN!

>Cool huh? 

<JS> (as Californian) No, dude.

>Well I g2g. Have any Qs? Well I have The A's! 

<All>……………
<Vegetta> This man's stupidity is painful.
<Ranma> Wasn't it ignorance?
<Vegetta> I'll make an exception for him.

>Send me an e-mail if you have any qustions or comments. Please don't 
say anything 
>about the spelling. I know it's bad.

<All> BAD?!  You're right next to Tank Cop!

> Sorry but I'll try better. My e-mail is mihoshi_spacegirl@yahoo.com.

<Vegetta> I'm not even going to ask.
<Ryoko> I'll be in my room reading the dictionary.  I feel stupid at 
the moment.
<JS> Jim!  You got the guns down?!
<Jim> Yeah, but I'm afraid that this wasn't the end of the "Mysterious 
Taskmaster.
<JS>……………Pretty good.
<Jim> Thank you.
<Ranma> Loreal, don't ever misspell steak and crepes again, or I'll 
kill you.
<Asuka> And if you try to write another fic, don't try to do better.  
Just…don't write it.
<JS> I'm glad you realize you're spelling is bad, but THAT'S NO DAMN 
EXCUSE!  Asuka, wait up!

******************

This was bad.  I mean bad, bad.  I got a little rusty on jokes near the 
end, but I managed…I think.  And this goes to Loreal, if you come out 
with "Nobiyuki the Rapest," there will be no future for you.  I have 
connections.  At least I think I do.
