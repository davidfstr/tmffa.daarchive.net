[SCENE: A dimly lit room.  There is a large plush couch, a big screen TV
and a VCR.  Noriko Kobayashi is sitting on the couch, looking at a
magazine.]

        NORIKO: Hmm... I see that "Silent Mobius" is now a TV show...
nice... nice... I see they're using the movie uniforms... nice... and
Kiddy has her original hair back... good.

[SCENE: The door opens in and in walks Marta Nys.  Sound FX: Applause
and whistles.]

        MARTA: Thank you!  Thank you!
        NORIKO: What the hell was that about?
        MARTA: Well, I am the most popular member of this review group,
so it's only fair that I acknowledge my fans.
        NORIKO: With a soundtrack?
        MARTA: Blame Magic Voice.
        NORIKO: Never mind.  Where is your better half?
        MARTA: Ling Ling?  She's out with a chest cold.
        NORIKO: Really?  <pause>  I hope you're giving her something for
it.  With a chest like hers that could be fatal.

[SCENE: Marta and Noriko turn to look at the camera.  Sound FX: Laughter
and applause.]

        NORIKO <Picks up a piece of paper, crumples it into a ball and
tosses it over her shoulder>: Okay, so much for that gag.  Where is Ling
Ling, really?
        MARTA: Visiting her parents in Australia.
        NORIKO: Lucky her.  Where is your sister?
        MARTA: Shion has the day off.  I have no idea where she is.

[SCENE: A bathtub that rivals B-ko's.  The scene is filled with steam
and we can hear the faint sound of Kodo in the background.  In the
center of the picture, Shion (who has her back to the camera) is running
a large sponge over her long legs.  She dips the sponge into the water,
pushes her knee-length hair over one shoulder and starts to....]

        SHION <turning to look at the camera>: DO YOU MIND!

[SCENE: Shion points her hand and the scene vanishes into static and
fuzz.  Sound FX: Cheers and whistles.]

        NORIKO: Yes, well.  It will just be the two of us then?
        MARTA: No, I hear that we will be getting a guest visitor.
        NORIKO: Who?

[A knock sounds from the door]

        MAGIC VOICE: That's him now.
        VOICE: Hello?  Anyone here?
        MARTA: Yeah!  It's open!

[SCENE: The door opens and a young man enters.  He is dressed in a red
Chinese-styled shirt and black pants.  His frame is small and wiry
(think Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan) and he has silver eyes and hair.]

        YOUNG MAN: Hello!  Nice to meet you! [bows to Noriko and extends
a
hand to Marta, who shakes it]
        NORIKO: And you are...
        YOUNG MAN: I'm Alexander Misamoto, Samantha Jones's younger
brother!
        MARTA <sounds skeptical>: Uh-huh.
        ALEX: Same father, different mother.
        MAGIC VOICE: Please describe yourself.
        ALEX <looks up>: Huh?
        MARTA: This happens whenever we get a new guest.  You must give
a description of yourself before we can start the fanfic.
        ALEX: Oh... [turns to camera] Well, my name is Alexander
Misamoto, Sam's younger brother, and I'm 17.  I stand five feet seven
inches tall, weigh about 160 pounds, and I have silver eyes and hair.
Basically, I have the same powers that Samantha does in, that I have a
warrior's soul within my own soul.  The only difference is that I can
tap into mine and use it a lot more easier then Samantha can with hers.
I've also had more years of training in the martial arts.
Unfortunately, I don't have the combat experience that big sister does.
        MAGIC VOICE: That is all.
        ALEX: Okay. [sits down between Marta and Noriko]
        NORIKO: Ahem.  'Soul within a soul'?
        ALEX: Yeah! A soul within a soul. I can draw upon it to enhance
any of my physical nattributes.  My eyes also glow a bright white when I
do so. [Taps into power and eyes blaze white]  What do you think?
        NORIKO: I think you need to settle down.
        MARTA: Oh, leave him alone.
        ALEX: Where's Shion and Ling Ling?  I thought it would be the
five of us riffing today's fanfic.
        MARTA: My sister has the day off and Ling Ling is visting her
parents.  So you're stuck with us.
        ALEX: You make it sound like a bad thing.
        NORIKO: Heh, you don't know Marta very well, do you?
        ALEX: Uh...
        MAGIC VOICE: We have movie sign.
        ALEX: Isn't that supposed to be fanfic sign?
        MARTA: What?
        ALEX: Well, fanfic since it's not really a movie...

[The TV turns on]

                                WHERE'S RYOKO?
                MiSTed by Michael Surbrook and Jamie Jeans
                                        with
                Noriko Kobayashi, Marta Nys and Alexander Misamoto

>Where's Ryoko?

        ALEX: If you see her, don't approach her. She is very dangerous
and should be considered a threat at all times. If spotted, call
1-800-STOPPIRATES
        NORIKO: Not bad.
        ALEX: Thanks!

>A lemon fanfic based on Tenchi Muyo.

        ALEX: A lemon?  Should I be reading this then?
        NORIKO: Probably not.

>The usual warning will be inserted here: This fanfiction deals with
>sex, and should not be read by people under eighteen.

        ALEX: Hey, I'm under 18.  Does that mean I have to leave?
        MARTA: Yup, yer outta here kid.
        MAGIC VOICE: Wrong.

>Not, I'm sure, that anybody pays attention to it. (I certainly didn't
>when I was 17. :o)

        MARTA: I know I didn't.  Hell, I still don't.

> But the rules say that
>I've got to stick it in there (no, not THAT, in THERE! :o),

        ALEX: Boy!  This guy sure is giving them away, isn't he?

>or face the consequences.

        ALEX: A bunch of Pioneer's Lawyers will stop by and sue your
butt? No, wrong consequences...
        NORIKO: We can only hope...

>All characters in this fanfic are not, under ANY circumstances mine, I
>do NOT claim them, I do NOT want them!

        NORIKO: Then why write the story?  Why not leave well enough
alone?
        ALEX: Hey!  What's wrong with Ryoko?  She's a perfectly nice
lady once you get to meet her!
        MARTA: Uh... you met Ryoko?
        ALEX: Yeah! We're MSTing partners back at the Anipike.
        <Marta and Noriko look at each other and then at Alex>
        NORIKO: What *are* you talking about?
        ALEX: The Anipike is this Club that Misato owns. It's where all
the Anime characters get together and relax in-between fanfics and
movies.

>This fanfiction is purely opinion, and immagination,

        NORIKO: Well, that certainly was an imaginative way to spell
'imagination'.

>and does NOT, under any circumstances reflect on the actual series.

        ALEX: This may be a bit early, but thank god for that!
        NORIKO: Yet another fan fic where the orginal story is thrown to
the wolves.

>This is my first (and possibly last) attempt at a fanfiction, so feel
free to

        ALEX: Celebrate like there's no tomorrow!
        MARTA: Rip it to shreds?

>give comments, quips, insults, or death threats at: Platinum_Dragon@
>usinternet.com

        ALEX: Death threats?  Come on, the fanfic couldn't possible be
*that* bad.
        NORIKO: Platinum Dragon?  So this was written by Bahamut then?
        MARTA: Don't tell me you play that?
        NORIKO: Nope, but we have some of the books in the occult
library back at the station.  For reference of course.
        MAGIC VOICE: Cool it, before They Sue Regularly hear you.

>This is set in the Tenchi Muyo TV series, at the point where Ryoko
>drops Tenchi off at the Jurai Palace.

        ALEX: <Tenchi voice> AAAHH!!!  *THUD*
        MARTA <hands over ears>: Oww... next time not so loud, you got
that kid?
        ALEX: Sorry. I'm kinda nervous around you two.
        NORIKO: TV Series? Is that anything like the OVA series?
        ALEX: In a way it is, except that Tenchi doesn't find out about
his relations to Ayeka till near the very end of the series. Also, the
way that the cast meets is different.

>I don't know about the rest of you, but I kinda got to wondering what
>the heck happened to her, between when we last see her, with blood
>dripping onto the floor, and

        ALEX: She wouldn't even clean it up!

>the last episode, when she reappears, completely healthy.

        NORIKO: Tenchi lopped of her hand in the first OVA and she
regrew it *instantly*, and you wonder how she can become healthy between
episodes?

>So, without further adiue!

        NORIKO: That's 'adieu'.
        MARTA: Oh you think you're so smart just becuase you know a
little French.
        ALEX: The end! Thank you!

>***---***---***---***---***---***---***---***---***---***---***---***---*

>**---***---***---***---

        ALEX: Oh dear god! All those poor lines buried under all that
snow!  *sniff*  There'll be no way to save them!  Oh the humanity!
        MARTA <blinking and placing one hand on Alex's head>: Are you
feeling okay?
        ALEX: [blushes] Uh... yeah, just fine.
        NORIKO: This is going to be *long* story...

>        As Tenchi, Azaka, and Kamadake ran toward the huge entrance of
the palace,

        ALEX: <makes car racing noise>

>Ryoko waved,

        ALEX: Do the wave!
        NORIKO: Let's not.

>a pained smile on her face, her other hand pressed tightly against
>her side.

        ALEX <Ryoko voice>: Oh god I have got to stop eating those
burritos.  Damn heartburn gets me everytime.
        MARTA: That's sick, kid.  Keep it up.
        ALEX: Thanks!

>But the second they were out of sight, she collapsed to the ground,

        NORIKO <deadpan>: It must hurt falling on your face like that.

>her injury finally catching up with her.

        ALEX <as Injury>: Geez!  You could have waited for me, ya know!

>Ryo-ohki mewed in concern, and teleported Ryoko on board.  She had
taken a
>beating too, but unlike Ryoko,

        MARTA: She liked it!

> all she had to do to heal was return to cabbit form for a couple of
days.
> But Ryoko couldn't.

        ALEX: Expecially since she's not a cabbit.

>        Slowly, Ryo-ohki lifted off the ground,

        ALEX <NASA technician> We have lift off!
        MARTA <ditto>: The cabbit is in the air!

>after depositing Ryoko in the command chair,
>mentally wincing with the effort.  Maybe she had taken more of a
>beatng than she had thought.  She steeled herself

        ALEX: Oh no!  Now Ryo-oh-ki's stealing as well!

>for a fight out, but surprisingly, no one paid attention to her,
>as they were too busy fighting Nagi and Ken-ohki.

        ALEX: Kick some butt Nagi! Woohoo!!!
        NORIKO: Who?
        ALEX: Nagi was this new character who was introduced in episode
number ten of the TV series.  She's a bounty hunter who's obsessed with
capturing *or* killing Ryoko, which is bad news considering that she's
Ryoko's superior in a fight. She also looks like Ryoko except she wears
and tight blue and black bodysuit, a black cloak, and has her hair tied
back.

>        She pulled out of Jurai's atmosphere, and prepared to speed
>away from the area,

        ALEX: But forgot about those darn photo radar vans and got a
speeding ticket in the mail three weeks later.

>her attention focused more on protecting her master than actually on
> Ryoko at the moment,

        ALEX: Uh... hmmmm... could you rephrase that?  From that line I
gather that she was concerned about Ryoko but not Ryoko...
        MARTA: Right... her master isn't... wait... she wants to protect
Ryoko, not... uh... what was the question?

>so it startled her when she realized the pirate was talking.

        MARTA <Ryoko voice>: No, Tenchi!!!  Not the kabuki mask!!!
        ALEX: Pardon?

> She turned to Ryoko, her face popping up on the crystal directly in
front
> of her, continuing her preparations to leave in the back of her mind.

        ALEX: What? Does Ryo-oh-ki have a computer for a mind now?
        NORIKO: Probably something very close.  She is a spaceship as
well as a cabbit, you know.

>        Her voice was very weak, and Ryo-ohki had a hard time
> understanding her, straining to hear.

        ALEX: <Old guy> Eh? What was that youngster? Speak louder.

>        "Well, I guess it's over, eh, Ryo-ohki?" she said.

        ALEX: Yeah, the TV series is over and you're out of work...
except for fanfic and Senshi Tenchi TV.
        NORIKO: I did not hear you say that.
        MARTA: Senshi Tenchi?  Not as in Sailor Moon senshi?
        ALEX: No, not Sailor Moon. It's basically the second Tenchi TV
series.  I asked Tenchi and even *he* doesn't know why they added that
to the name.

>        "Miyaaa..."
>
>        "So here we are again, just you and I.  Just the way we were
>when we fell to the Earth.

        NORIKO: So... Ryoko's really David Bowie?
        MARTA: Right, and Ryo-ohki is the cabbit from Mars.
        ALEX: Uh... I don't get it.
        MARTA: Don't worry Ziggy Stardust, you will someday.
         ALEX: <thinking> 'Ziggy'?

> We sure had some fun times though, huh?"

        ALEX: Getting cased by a dangerous bounty hunter, the whole
Jurain Fleet, a powerful madman... Yup!  Nothing but fun!
        NORIKO: I've had days like that.

>        "Miyaa!"  Ryoko grinned, but it was a sad grin.
>
>        "I guess... I'm... lonely... pretty pathetic, huh?"  Ryoko
>closed her eyes, and, after a moment, her mouth fell slightly open.

        ALL: <reach up to close Ryoko's mouth>

>        "Miya?" asked Ryo-ohki.
>
>        No answer.

        ALEX: Maybe you ought to pick up the phone first.
        MARTA <holding nose to simulate phone operator>: The number you
have dialed is no longer in service.  Please hang up and dial again.

>        "Miya???" she asked again, louder this time, worry clear in her

> voice.
>        Ryoko's hand fell over the side of the chair, to hang limply.
> Blood began to drip onto the floor.  Ryoko slumped forward.

        ALEX: *THUMP*

>        "MIYYYYAAAA!!!!" cried Ryo-ohki.
>>        The ship flew away from Jurai, unmolested by the military
> fleet.

        ALEX: A good thing too, considering that lawsuit they were hit
with last week.

>        Away, into the endless night of space.

        NORIKO: Space... the final frontier...

>***

        ALEX: My god it's... full of stars...

>        Ringle-tingle-tingle...

        MARTA <singing>: I got spurs that go jingle-jangle-jingle!

>        The ice in the glass bounced off the sides, making a muted
sound.

        ALEX: Then how could it be heard?

>With a slight frown, Nagi drank the purple fluid,

        NORIKO: Great, she must have gotten her drink from the same
place that gave Star Trek Play-doh food.

>and then set down the glass.  Nearly two weeks since she had
>helped Ryoko and her friends, and still she hadn't heard
>even a rummor of a rummor of Ryoko.

        ALEX: Not just rumors, but rumors of rumors!

>        "Hey," she said, signalling the bartender,

        MARTA: "C'mon down here."
        MAGIC VOICE" Wha'chu want?"
        MARTA: "One bourbon, one scotch, and one beer!"

>and pulling out an old photograph.

        NORIKO <T-1000 voice>: Have you seen this boy?

>It was tattered, and worn with age.  Looking at it, Nagi had a
>sudden image of the last time she had seen Ryoko.

        MARTA: Or, the top of her head anyway.

> There had been something very different in
>her then there had been in this photo.

        ALEX: Maybe she had a new haircut.

>        "Yeah?  Another drink, miss?" Nagi shook her head.
>        "Have you seen this woman?"  The bartender peered at it, and
>shook his head.

        MARTA <snicker>: Good call, Noriko.
        ALEX: <Bartender> Darn... hang on and let me get my glasses...

>        "Sorry, no.  Friend of yours?"  She stood up so fast that she
>knocked over her stool, and drew stares from the bar's
>few other occupants.  Ken-ohki, at her
>feet, lifted an ear, sneezed, and went back to sleep.

        ALEX: <Ken-oh-ki> ZZZzzzz... carrots... ZZZzzzzz... Ryo-oh-ki...
ZZzzz...

>        "WHAT?" she growled at him.

        ALL: He said: "FRIEND OF YOURS?"

>Then, she took a deep breath, composed herself,
>and flashed a slight smile.  "No...  Of course not."  But even as she
> said it, as she had said before, she realized that wasn't quite right
either.
> Ryoko...  Maybe not a friend, but after all this time hunting her? All
the
> battles they had fought?  No, not a friend. But still... Something.

        ALEX: Uh... yeah, your income!  You're a bounty hunter,
remember?

>Shaking off the thought, she bent to pick up the chair.
> As she was about to order another drink,

        NORIKO: If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was your
sister.
        MARTA: Haha... my sister's drinking problem isn't that bad and
you know it.
        NORIKO: You just keep thinking that.

> Ken-ohki's ears suddenly picked up.

        ALEX: The next drink for her.

>        "Cia?"  The cabbit looked up, and around, as if he had heard
> something.

        ALEX: <Nagi> What's that Ken-oh-ki?  Ryoko fell in the well
again?  Leave her there, the stupid idiot...
        MARTA <glaring at Alex>: Thanks for stealing my Lassie joke.
        ALEX: What do you mean, *your* Lassie joke?  Big sister did it
first!
        NORIKO: Quiet, both of you.

>Nagi followed his line of sight, and saw a small form in the doorway,
> with large ears, and brown fur,

        MARTA: And a gun.  Bambi was mad as hell and looking for
vengance!

> a match to Ken-ohki, save that this cabbit was female.

        ALEX: except that Ryo-oh-ki has brown fur and Ken-oh-ki has kind
of a off-white fur plus Ken is bigger then Ryo.
        NORIKO: So, an exact match then?

>        "Ryo-ohki?" she asked, curious why the cabbit had let herself
> be seen by Nagi. She looked at her with- what? Sorrow? Hope?

        ALEX: I don't know.  Why ask us?
        NORIKO: Probably confusion, considering how this story has been
going.

>        "Miya?"  There was a note of urgency in her voice that pulled
> Nagi out of her seat.

        ALEX: This is beginning to sound like an old Lassie episode.
        MARTA: Only if someone is named 'Timmy'.

>Ken-ohki bounded over to Ryo-ohki, and tried to nuzzle her, but she
>ignored him, still looking at Nagi.  While she could talk to Ken-ohki
> and understand him, Ryo-ohki was Ryoko's so she couldn't understand
her.

        ALEX: And when was this law passed? You understand one, you
understand them all!
        NORIKO: Maybe not.  There could some form of user specific
mental link between each cabbit and their companion.
        MARTA: Noriko, the Mr. Wizard of the MST3K set.
        NORIKO: Get stuffed.
        ALEX: Do you two bicker like this every day?
        MARTA & NORIKO <glaring at Alex>: NO!!!
        ALEX: Sure... okay...

>        Why was she here, reveiling herself openly?  She couldn't quite

> buy that the cabbit had wanted to see Ken-ohki so badly that
> she had endangered her master.

        MARTA: I dunno, I've done some pretty stupid things in the name
of love.
        NORIKO: Shouldn't that be 'lust'?
        MARTA: That too.
        ALEX: <singing> I would do anything for love... but I won't do
that...

>And there was the fact that she was still ignoring him.
>        Unless...
>        "Come on, Ken-ohki!"

        ALEX: Now this *has* turned into an old episode of Lassie!

>        "Miya!"  Ryo-ohki turned, and led them out, into the night.

        MARTA: To vanish from this story forever.  The End.
        NORIKO: You wish.
        ALEX: And I thought that kind of joke was done to death over at
the Anipike!

> She raced as fast as she could without leaving Nagi in the dust.
>She knew that Ryo-ohki could have easilly out distanced them
>if she had wanted to.  Through the city, they raced,

        ALEX: <singing> Over the hills and throug the woods to
Grandmother's house they go.

>and to the ouskirts.  Still farther, to a cospe of trees.  Nagi entered

>slowly, suddenly wary of an ambush.
>        "Miya miya mayaaa!"  Once inside the ring of trees, Nagi
>understood why Ryo-ohki had been so insistant.

        MARTA: She had to go *real* bad...

>        "Damn!"  No longer afraid of an ambush, Nagi walked in, and
>kneeled beside Ryoko's prone form.  Her skin was so pale as to
>appear grey.  It was a testament to her fortitude that she was still
alive,
>but she was, as was told by her chest very slowly, very shallowly

        MARTA: There is *nothing* shallow about Ryoko's chest.

>rising and falling.  Suddenly Nagi laughed.  "Why
>you sly dog!" Nagi exclaimed.

        ALEX: <makes barking sounds>

>"A trance!"  Ryoko had put herself into a trance,
>but even so, the wound was too much.  She had
>just lost too much blood.

        ALEX: Actually, I believe it's called a coma.
        NORIKO: Not if it's self-imposed.
        ALEX: Oh.

>        "Miya?"  The question was clear. Nagi looked at the young
>cabbit.
>        "You want me to help her?  When you know that I'm trying to
>kill her?"

        NORIKO: Yes, of course.  We want you nice and healthy for your
eventual execution.
        ALEX: And she understands him perfectly despite the fact that it
was said earlier she couldn't... this fanfic is gonna go down hard.

>        "Miya!" Ryo-ohki shook her head vigourously.  Nagi thought
>about it for a moment, then shook her head.
>        "No, I-"
>        "Ciao!!" hissed Ken-ohki at her.  He moved to stand beside
> Ryo-ohki, warning clear in his eyes.

        ALEX: Labeled in red.
        MARTA <deep voice>: Help Ryoko or the cabbit gets it!

>Nagi didn't need his mental sending to figure out the
>message - help her, or I split.  Nagi stared at him in surprise.

        ALEX: <Nagi voice> You did *what* on the floor? Bad Ken-oh-ki!
Bad Ken-oh-ki!!!
        MARTA <Nagi voice>: After all I've done for you, and this is the
thanks I get?  That's low... dishonest.
        NORIKO: Cool it, Gyro-captain.

>        "You too, Ken-ohki?"

        NORIKO: Et tu, Brute?

> She questioned him.  The cabbit looked at her.  Nagi
>grinned, for once the smile reaching her eyes.  "I should have known.
> Alright, alright."
>        Carefully, Nagi slid her arms under Ryoko, and picked her up,
>taking care to not break the seal over her wound.

        ALEX: <makes the sound of a blood vessel popping> Oh, we got a
gusher here!

>Strong as she might be, there was no way
>that she would survive the wound reopening.  "Let's get her to the

>***

        ALEX: <Weatherman> Light flurries today followed by clear skies
in the evening.

>        "Ungh..."

        NORIKO: My sentiments exactly.

>        Ryo-ohki's ears perked up at the sound.  Ken-ohki nuzzled her.
>        _What is it?_ His voice, deep and sonorus, sounded in her
> mind.  She smiled, and nuzzled him back.
>        _I think my master is coming around.  But..._
>        _You worry about Nagi._  It was a statement, not a question.

        ALEX: We could tell by the lack of a question mark.

>        _Yes...  It's been on my mind since I first came to find you._
>        _Give her a little credit, my love.  I think that her desire to

> hunt Ryoko down is waining._
>        Ryo-ohki smiled again, and cuddled closer to Ken-ohki.  The
> older male nuzzled her again, the cabbit equivalent of kissing.

        ALEX: Ahhh... how cute...  Hang on, I think I just got a cavity
here...
        MARTA: I think I'm going to hurl...

>        Ryoko stired, and Ryo-ohki scrambled over to her.
>        "Miya?"  Suddenly, Ryoko's body began to shake like a leaf in a

> gale.

        ALEX: I think that's supposed to be a tree in the wind.

>        "Miya! Miya!"  Nagi came into the room at all the noise.
>        "Damn!" She dashed over, and held Ryoko down until the
>convulsions ended.  "Two weeks, and almost no change." She shook
> her head, and left the room.

        ALEX: So Ryoko's periodically convulsing every little while is
perfectly normal.

>        "Miyaa..." said Ryo-ohki mournfully.  She hung her head sadly.

        NORIKO: I am filled with shame.

> Ken-ohki came over beside her.  She leaned into him,
> drawing strength from him.

        ALEX: Oh no!  She's a vampire!

>        _Come on... Why don't we go for a walk?  Something to get your
> mind off of this._
>        _I don't think a walk will help._
>        _What about a carrot?  I got Nagi to get a few the last time we

> swung by Earth, and there are a couple left._  Ryo-ohki sighed.
>        _No, not even a carrot..._

        ALEX: This is not Ryo-oh-ki!  It's some twisted clone from
another dimension!!!

>Ken-ohki frowned, but then got a sly grin.
>        _I think I know..._

        MARTA: Sex?  It always works for me.

>        _What could be better then a carr-_  She was cut off by
>Ken-ohki, who had nuzzled her full
>on the face.

        ALEX: Oh no...  This is bad... this is very bad...
        MARTA: Uh... I was kidding about that.

>Surprise washed through her, but it was replaced by pleasure.

        ALEX: ACK!  This is extremely bad!!!

>***

        NORIKO: I don't think I've even been more thankful for a scene
change.

>        "Miya! MIIYYAA!!"
>        "CIAOOO!"

        ALEX: [shakes] I think I'm gonna have nightmares for a week now.

        MARTA: Well... I wasn't kidding about sex being a great relief
for stress... but NOT BETWEEN CABBITS, YOU SICK BASTARD!

>        Nagi's head shot up at the sudden racket.

        ALEX: <makes a rimshot noise>

>She listened for a minute, and then laughed out loud,
> suddenly glad she had paid for the sound-proofed apartment.

        ALEX: But then how could she... oh never mind.
        MARTA: Who says they are doing it another room?

>        "I was starting to think they'd never go for it."  Grinning at
>yet another out burst, she punched up the sound screen.

        ALEX & NORIKO: Thank you!

>***

>        Nagi lay on the couch, idly stroking both cabbit's fur, who
> were streached out with her.

        ALEX: 'streached'?
        MARTA: Wow Nagi... was it good for you too?
        ALEX: Are you always like this?
        MARTA & NORIKO: Yes.

>They had disappeared for a number of days, off to who knew where.
>Nagi had almost started to worry about Ken-ohki when they had returned
> from their cavorting.

        MARTA: Cavorting?  Aardvarking is more like it.

>        "I'm glad you two decided to rejoin the world.  Have a good
> honeymoon?"

        ALEX: <Ryo-oh-ki> Well the hotels were booked, the airline lost
our luggage and... Oops! I mean, Miyaa!

>        "Meow!"

        NORIKO: That's 'miyaa', Ryo-ohki's *not* a cat!

>        "Ciao!" Nagi laughed, and poked a finger at Ryo-ohki.  As much
>as she hated to admit it, she was getting attached to the little
furball.

        ALEX: Hopefully not with glue.
        NORIKO: Typical.  Every show seems to require some disgustingly
cute creature to show up everywhere.
        MARTA: It's called marketing.

>        "And is it just my imagination, or have you put on some weight,

>Ryo-ohki?"  The brown furred cabbit blushed slightly, and
>meowed quietly.  "Oh-ho!  I see!" Nagi laughed again,
>a great deep belly laugh that hadn't made an appearance with her
>in nearly sixteen years.  Ken-ohki looked at her, surprised, which only

>made her laugh harder.

        ALEX: <Ken-ohki voice> Oh crap, she cracked.  Time to call the
men in white suits!

>        Her mirth, however, was cut short by a crash from Ryoko's room.

        ALEX: <makes crashing noise>

>She got up,
>but no sooner was she to her feet than Ryo-ohki was through the door,
> Ken-ohki right on her heels.

        ALEX: <Ryo-oh-ki> Ouch! Hey, I'm trying to run here, Ken-ohki!

>Nagi walked across the chamber, and poked her head into the
>room.

        NORIKO: If Nagi's anything like Ryoko, she might not have even
bothered to open the door.

>        "Mew miyyaa mew meow miyaaa!!!" Ryo-ohki was up on her hind
>legs, chittering a mile a minute, at the kneeling form of Ryoko.

        MARTA: Kneel!  Kneel before Ryoko!

> One hand was on the floor, the other on a small table,
> where a small lamp had been.  The lamp was now down on
>the floor, broken into a dozen pieces.

        ALEX: Does the security deposit cover that?
        NORIKO: Nope.

>        "Well, welcome back to the land of the living, Ryoko," said
>Nagi.  Ryoko looked up at her, surprise on her face.

        MARTA <Ryoko voice>: Where am I, where are all my clothes?

>        "Nagi!" Slowly, she struggled to her feet, obviously intending
>to fight
>        "Oh, would you relax?  I didn't keep you alive, healing your
>wounds, for over a month, just to kill you!"

        NORIKO: Do you expect me to talk?
        MARTA: No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!

>Ryoko stared at her for a moment, confusion and
>surprise painted on her face.

        ALEX: Here...  [stands up]  Let me get that off for ya.

>        "I don't think that I could have put up a spark in defence
>anyway," she said, leaning against the wall to try to hide
>how weak she was.

        ALEX: <snorts> Yeah, good move to cover that weakness Ryoko.
        NORIKO: That's been done a thousand times before.

>She looked from Ryo-ohki to Ken-ohki.
>"I take it this is your doing."  Ryo-ohki meekly meowed.
>Ryoko frowned.  "We'll talk about it later.  For now, however..."

        MARTA <deep voice>: Gimme some sugar, baby.

>Ryoko put her hands down, and the cabbit bounded over to her.
>Wincing with the effort, Ryoko picked her up.

        ALEX: Geez! Ryoko needs to work out more!

>"Ouff!  You'll picked up some weight."  Ryoko set her down, and
>then looked at Nagi.  "Well, if you aren't gonna kill me, yet, what are

>you gonna do?  I'm somewhat at your mercy,
>as much as it pains me to admit it."

        ALEX: Is this the part where the lemon starts?
        MARTA <eyes wide>: I hope so!
        NORIKO <eyes toward ceiling>: Help me...

>        "At the moment, I'm gonna help you to the bath.  I'm sick of
>sponging you down.  And then I'm gonna try and get some food in you.
>Otherwise I'd have two very unhappy cabbits on my hands."
>        "Miya!" "Ciao!"
>        Ryoko raised her eyebrow, but submitted to the help.

        ALEX: She has no free will.
        MARTA: Shaddup.  Ling Ling can give me a bath anytime she wants.

        ALEX: Uh... okay...

>She knew bloody well that she couldn't escape, and besides,
>she wanted to find out what Nagi's sudden
>change of heart was all about.

        NORIKO: That's easy, it's all the writer's idea.

>        "Oh, you might be interested in this," said Nagi, suddenly.
> Ryoko looked at her.

        ALEX: <Ryoko> Ryo-o-ki did *what* on the carpet?!

>        "Your... Tanchi, Tounchi?"

        MARTA: Tachi?
        NORIKO: Tetsuo?
        ALEX: Snookums?
        MARTA & NORIKO: Snookums?
        ALEX: Sorry, it slipped out.

>        "Tenchi?" she asked.  In waking up in the lion's den, so to
> speak, she had completly forgoten about him.

        ALEX: The love of her life?  No way!

>        "Tenchi, that was it."
>        "What?  What is it?"  Nagi's eyes widened just slightly, and
>then closed almost to slits, as though she was trying
>to add something together.

        ALEX: <Nagi> Two plus Two is five... no.  Two plus two is six...
no!  Two plus two is...
        NORIKO: Two plus two *is* five... for moderately large values of
two.

>        "Well, he won, first of all.  And, I've heard that, after a
>short stay on Jurai, while his grandfather healed,
>they went back to the Earth."
>        "Back.. to the Earth?  Not stay on Jurai?"
>        "That's what I just said, isn't it?"

        ALEX: At least she didn't say 'what'.

>        "Then that means..."

        MARTA: You're SOL, Ryoko.
        ALEX: 'SOL'?
        MARTA: Shit-outta-luck.

>With a sudden effort, Ryoko pushed Nagi
>off of her. Nagi's hand immeadiatly went to her whip,

        MARTA: Ooh... kinky.
        ALEX: Are you... I'm not going to bother.

>but Ryoko just stood there.  She walked the rest of the way to the
bath.
>After the door closed, Nagi frowned again.
>Her mind went back to that picture, and the feeling that there
>was something different about Ryoko.  Now this, the sudden
>gain of strength when she had found out that Tenchi
>had gone back to the Earth.  But what difference would
>that make?

        ALEX: It probably means that Ryoko has a better chance for
winning Tenchi's heart without all those other girls there.

>        She sat down to puzle it out.  What would be the difference
>between Tenchi staying on Jurai, and him going back.
>What did the Earth not have that Jurai had?

        NORIKO: A distinct lack of political intrigue?

>Her eyes widened, as she realized what it was.

        MARTA: The best beer in the galaxy?
        ALEX: Akane's special?
        NORIKO: Sushi.

>        The Earth didn't have Ayeka.  But that couldn't be it...
>        Ryoko couldn't possibly have learned to... love?

        ALEX: Ding!  Ding!  Ding!  We have realization!
        NORIKO: Meaning?  Tenchi is going to pick Ryoko over Ayeka?

>        Nagi rolled the seed around in the back of her mind,

        ALEX: Dropping it and getting a twelve.

>trying to decide whether to plant it, or throw it out.

        NORIKO: Throw it out.
        MARTA: Plant it!  Plant it!!!

> How many clues had she dropped?  Coming after
>Tenchi when Nagi had first found her on Earth.  That hadn't fit her
>style.  Staying with them - with him - even when they
>were all hunted criminals?
>        Taking him to the planet Jurai, when she was so grieviously
>wounded?
>        After considering it, she decided to save it for a bit.

        ALEX: On disk, in case the hard drive crashed.

>***

        ALEX: Three stars?  Come on, the fanfic's not *that* good!
        NORIKO: I give it a two.

>        Ryoko slowly clambered into the bath, her body weak from a
>month of inactivity.

        ALEX: Actually, it would be weak from healing the wound and
stiff from the month of inactivity.
        MARTA: So?  She still looks pretty good.

>Stiff muscles slowly loosened as she soaked in the hot water.  Ryo-ohki

>mewed at her from the floor.
>        "Well, here we go again, I'm guessing.  What were you thinking,

>Ryo-ohki?" she asked the cabbit,

        MARTA <Ryo-ohki voice>: That I was going to get some and you
weren't?

>trying to make her voice stern, but without much luck.
>Truth was, she knew that she was lucky anybody at all had helped her.
>        "Miya!  Mew meow miya!"
>        "But to Nagi? Come on!"

        MARTA: Actually Ryo-ohki came with Ken-ohki, but let's not
quibble.
        ALEX: Do you have one of those comments for every line?
        MARTA <grinning>: Yes.

>        "Miya!"
>        "I suppose there is that.  But the question is, how are we
>gonna get outta here?"

        ALEX: You could try using the door.

>        "Meow?"
>        "ASK!  Have you lost your carrots, Ryo-ohki?!?"

        ALEX: No, she ate them all.

>        "Miya!"  Ryoko grinned, in spite of herself.

        ALEX: Uh-oh. Ryoko is beginning to sound like Ryo-oh-ki.

>        "Oh, I see.  And has Ken-ohki given you anything else?"

        NORIKO <deadpan>: Kittens.

>The cabbit blushed, and Ryoko thought again of the extra weight
>that Ryo-ohki had put on  Could it be???

        ALEX: Let's not delve into that area, okay?
        MARTA: Too late. Ken-ohki already did.
        ALEX: <groans in exasperation>

>        "Well, that will be something to see."  Ryoko's smile faded.
>"I wonder what Tenchi is doing..."

        MARTA: If I was Tenchi?  Kiyone.  But he's probably with Ayeka.
        ALEX: And I thought Ryoko and Shampoo were bad at the hentai
jokes.

>        "Mew..."
>        "You miss him too, eh?"  She shook her head, and got up, out of

>the bath.  Water streamed in rivulets off her body.

        ALEX: [looks away and blushes] Uh... please put some clothes on,
Ryoko.
        MARTA: Why?  You never seen a woman naked?
        ALEX: Uh... [swallows nervously] no...
        MARTA <unzips her jumpsuit to her navel>: Wanna?
        ALEX: [blushes really red and looks away]

>Only out of the trance for half an
>hour, and already she felt stronger.  She raised her hand, and a few
>sparks of energy crackled to life.

        ALEX: Should she be doing that in the bathtub?
        NORIKO: Just as long as she doesn't turn on the radio.

>They were weak, but they were better than nothing.
>She slipped into her robe after toweling off, and exited the bath.
>Nagi was sitting on the couch, and there was a tray of food on the
table.
>Ryoko's stomach growled,

        ALEX: Setting off car alarms for miles around.

>reminding her that you couldn't eat while in a trance.  Nagi
>raised her eyebrow, and waved at the tray.
>        "Don't worry, no poison.  I give my word of honor."  Ryoko
>frowned, but her stomach rumbled ominously,

        ALEX: Everyone get down! She's gonna blow!

>and she decided it was better to chance poison than
>starvation.  At least she'd die full.  She sat down, and selected a
>fair sized piece of meat, some kind of Juraian turkey,

        NORIKO: The Emperor, perhaps?

>she thought, and sandwiched it.  She
>took a tenative bite, chewed, and then, satisfied that it was safe,
>started to wolf it down.

        ALEX: WOLF-A-RINE!!! WOLF-A-RINE!!! WOLF-A-RINE!!!
[Marta and Noriko jump from thier seats and look at Alex]
        MARTA: What the hell was that?
        NORIKO: Yes... a bit of warning next time before you decide to
explode.
        ALEX: Sorry. Wolf-a-rine is basically this rat clone of
Wolverine in the AAAT. He's a pretty cool fighter!

>        "I'm just curious," she said, in between bites, "but why did
>you help me?  Hunting me for all that time, just to save my life
>when your quest could have been at an end?"  Nagi laughed.

        MARTA <Nagi voice>: That would have been too easy!  I want to
see you suffer when I kill you!
        NORIKO: I think you need to relax.

>        "Ken-ohki and Ryo-ohki didn't leave me with much of a choice.
>Besides which,  I've told you before.  The only way you're gonna die
>is at the end of my sword."

        ALEX: Ah Nagi! What a delightful conversationalist, isn't she?
        MARTA: Hmm... I remember my sister saying that's the way she
wanted to go... except she didn't use the word sword and it wasn't Nagi
she was talking about...
        NORIKO: That's enough.

>Ryoko winced at the matter of fact way that she said it.  She decided
>to try changing the subject.

        NORIKO: So... how about the Yankees this year?  Think they have
a chance?

>        "Do you remember the first time that we met?" she asked Nagi.

        MARTA <Nagi voice>: Not really, I was kinda drunk at the time.

>Her eyes closed nearly to slits.
>        "It was on my first bounty.  I had just captured the slimeball,

>and then suddenly, there you were.  Blasted him before I had a
chance to stop you.  I never did figure out why you killed him."

        ALEX: <Ryoko> Idiot took my parking space!

>Ryoko closed her eyes, feeling a tear
>forming.  What ever she did, she refused to cry in front of Nagi.
>        "He murdered... someone very close to me.  I suppose that he's
>the one that got me along the path of piracy.

        ALEX: Which, of course, makes perfect sense... NAH!
        NORIKO: I thought that was Kagato's fault?
        ALEX: Actually, I think this is a case of the author making up a
past for the characters. Happened in this Tenchi/El Hazard crossover I
heard about.

>Like you have done to me, I tracked him down.
>When I happened upon you, with him all wrapped up in a neat little
>package, I decieded to take it as a gift from the gods."
>Behind her closed eyes, the scene replayed itself in her mind.

        ALEX: She got a four-head VCR in there?

>Ryoko seeing the young woman, her whip wrapped
>around his body.  Nagi shouting at her as she fired an energy blast.
>The pure terror in his eyes, the terror of a man who knew
>that he was going to die, as it flew toward him.

        ALEX: So Ryoko's an *it* now.
        NORIKO: No, the energy blast is an 'it'. Stop trying to make
comments that aren't there.
        MARTA: Oh lay off... little seaweed girl
        NORIKO <glaring at Marta>: *Never* call me that again.
        ALEX: Seaweed girl?
        NORIKO <glares at Alex>: Don't even think about it.

>        The memory was replaced by another, Ryoko screaming as
> a weapon blast tore into a young man.  He had dark hair,
>of a purple hue, and a regal, royal bearing.

        NORIKO: That sure doesn't describe Tenchi.
        ALEX: The hell?  I think we got stuck on memory lane and can't
find a turn off.

>Another girl was watching too, about the same age as Ryoko,
>also with purple hair.  She wore a kimono, and she also screamed
>as the man feel to the ground.
>She teleported to his side, held him to her body as he
>breathed his last.  The other girl was running toward them.
>She screamed, and teleported away, the last look on the scene
>at the face of the other girl, on which rage, horror and
>sorrow were painted so visably.  A single tear escaped her clamped shut

>eyes.

        ALEX: So, in other words, there was lots of girls crying.
        MARTA: That made no sense.
        NORIKO: Well... I was going to guess Yousho and Ayeka... but now
I'm not so sure...

>        "So, the mighty space pirate Ryoko has a heart after all," said

>Nagi mockingly.
>Ryoko's eyes snapped open, fires raging within them.

        ALEX: Some Visine will help with that.

>        "Is that so hard for you to believe?  That I'm capable of more
>than treachary, theivery, hate and destruction?

        MARTA: Uh... no.

>That I can love?  You're a fine one to judge!

        ALEX: I guess this is time for the one paragraph character
developement.
        MARTA: And then we get the sex scene... right?
        ALEX: You seem pretty enthusiastic about it.
        MARTA: I like girls, sue me.

>You've been after me for so long that you've forgoten
>what anything other than hate and contempt feel like!
>You haven't hunted me!  You've become me!  Full of
>bitterness, and only one thing that you could latch onto.

        ALEX: Good thing Nagi had that safety rope.
        NORIKO: I think I've seen this speech about a thousand times...
the hunter has become the hunted... very cliche.

>You can't stand the
>idea that I've climbed out of that hole!" she exploded at Nagi.

        ALEX: Eww, man what a mess! Does anyone have a mop around here?

>When she realized what she had said, she shut her mouth
>with a click, realizing that she had probably just put the nails
>in her own coffin.  Indeed, Nagi's hand was on
>her sword pommel, and her eyes were hard and cold.

        MARTA: Hey, Alex?  Doesn't Nagi use an energy sword like every
one else?
        ALEX: No, actually, it's a cross between a energy sword and a
whip so it can be used as either one.

>        Then, slowly, her grip eased, and her eyes softened.
>        "You think so, Ryoko?"  Her gaze hardened once more, although
>this time, it was with determination, as if she had chosen a course.

        NORIKO: Second star on the left, and straight on till morning.

>She put her face right in front of Ryoko's.

        ALEX: <Ryoko> [waves hand in front of face] Whew! Brush your
teeth Nagi! Your breath stinks!

>        "Do you really believe that is so?" she said in a low, husky
voice.
>  And then she leaned in, and kissed Ryoko, hard, on the lips.

        ALEX: So *this* is the start of the lemon?
        MARTA <eyes light up>: Yeah!!!

>The movement caught Ryoko
>completely off guard, and for a moment, she just sat there,
>dumb-founded.

        ALEX: <Ryoko> Duh...

>Once her mind caught up with her body, she tried to lean back,
>but Nagi had her pinned against the back of the couch.

        MARTA: You *go*, girl!

>        But even as she tried to escape, trying to get away, her body
>responded to Nagi, reguardless of what her mind wanted.

        ALEX: Because women have no control over their bodies
whatsoever.
        NORIKO: Alex?
        ALEX: Yeah?
        NORIKO: How old are you?
        ALEX: 17.
        NORIKO: Do you want to be 18?
        ALEX: Yes...
        NORIKO: Then don't say anything like that ever again.
        ALEX: Sorry.  I was just trying to riff the fanfic.
        MARTA <drops arm of his shoulders>: Remember who you're riffing
this with.

>Even as she fought the feeling, she
>felt a flush come to her skin, a flush that had nothing to do with her
>injury.  Slowly, Nagi leaned back, a breathless look on her face,
>and surprise in her eyes at herself, at what she had done.
>There was a hush, and then Nagi spoke quietly.

        ALEX: <Nagi> I'm sorry. I am acting so OOC it ain't even funny.
        MARTA: Maybe...  My stupid sister shacked up with *her* greatest
enemy.  She's such an idiot!!!
        ALEX: Shacked?
        NORIKO: Living together.

>        "No feeling, save anger and hate?  Nothing but bitterness,
>Ryoko?  Did that feel like bitterness to you?"

        ALEX: <Ryoko voice> Well, you *were* eating lemons before this.
        MARTA: Bet's they'll be eating something else *real* soon!
        ALEX: I keep on walking into those.
        NORIKO: No arguement here.

>Worldless, Ryoko shook her head no.  And then did
>something even more surprising.  She leaned forward, and returned the
>kiss, with equal fervor.

        ALEX: [blushing]  Shouldn't you be resting when you have a
fever?
        MARTA: You don't have to watch if you don't want to.
        ALEX: Well I have to sit through one of these sooner or later,
so I might as well sit through it now.

>It was Nagi's turn to start,

        ALEX: The race for the World Championship!

>attempt to escape, but, like Ryoko, her body didn't quite seem to
>agree with her head.

        MARTA: I keep telling my sister, 'try it *my* way, you might
like it', but no...

>Slowly, as if unsure, her arms slipped around to Ryoko's back,

        ALEX: *SNAP* <Ryoko> AHHH!!!

>felt along the surface of her robe.  Ryoko's tounge slid out of
>her mouth, pushing gently along Nagi's teeth.

        ALEX: <Ryoko voice> Hey, I don't feel any tartar at all!

>Her hand moved up, a finger extending to touch Nagi's skin,
>and trace it's way downward, along the lines of her jaw and neck.
>Nagi's teeth parted at the gentle feeling, and Ryoko's tounge dipped
in,
>exploring, meeting its counterpart, entwining with it.

        ALEX: <Wildlife explorer voice> And here we see two Boa
Constrictors fight for the right to mate with the female.
        NORIKO: <snickers>

>        Nagi's hands moved to Ryoko's front, and began to work at the
>cord holding the robe closed.  Slowly, ever so very slowly,
>it came undone.  Finally, it was untied, and Ryoko's breasts
>were hanging before her, shapely and perfect.

        MARTA <reaches for the screen>: Damn, you ain't kidding.
        ALEX: [blushes and gets a nosebleed] Uh... should I be watching
this?
        MARTA & NORIKO: No!

>The nipples stood slightly up at the sudden breeze as
>Ryoko's robe fell open.  Nagi's hands glided up to them,
>cupped and began to squeeze one,

        MARTA: Amazing, they're all natural!

>two fingers tweeking and pulling at the nipples.
>Ryoko breathed a slight moan of pleasure at the sensation,
>and broke the kiss, her own hands following the skin-tight
>material of Nagi's battle suit downward.
>Nagi drew in a sharp breath as Ryoko reached her thighs,
>and trailed two fingers across them, and in between, tracing
>a line upwards, reaching her nether regions, and tugged hard at Ryoko's

>nipple, causing another moan.

        ALEX: Isn't that painful?
        MARTA: Kid?
        ALEX: Yeah?
        MARTA <sweet voice>: Shut up.
        ALEX: Sorry.

>        Ryoko trailed her fingers up and toward Nagi's pleasure center.

        ALEX: Hawaii?
        NORIKO: <snickers>

>Reaching the bud, she pressed down, through the suit,
>feeling the moistness begining to
>gather there, the warmth eminating.

        ALEX: Isn't that a cliche?
        NORIKO: Yes, but it does have some basis.
        MARTA: Like you would know.
        NORIKO <stands up>: Shut it you... <recovers her composure>
Ahem.  Never mind. <sits down>

>She phased her finger through, letting it
>sink just deep enough to notify Nagi of its presense.

        ALEX: <Finger> I'm here, what do you want?

>A slight shout issued
>from Nagi's lips.  She began to shrug out of the battle armor.

        ALEX: Battle armor? That's a freaking spandex suit, for crying
out loud!  Not body armor!  The only purpose it has is to make
everything stand out in stark relief! [blushes upon when he realizes
what he said]  Uh... I'll stop now...
        MARTA: Why?  You were doing pretty good there.

>First the hard plates, then the lighter soft suit came off.
>Ryoko gasped at the sight.  She had seen much of the bounty hunter's
>body at the swimsuit contest - in the back
>of her mind, a little message poked through

        MARTA: Yeah, Ryoko, she's bigger than you are.
        ALEX: Poke, poke, poke.

>_could it possibly be that was
>nearly two and a half months ago?_ - but the sight of her fully in the
>nude sent an electric shock through her mind.

        ALEX: GZZZ!!! <Ryoko> AHHH!!!
        MARTA: Yeah, well she's not doing me much good either.
        NORIKO: I suppose I should be thankful that Ling Ling isn't
here.  We'd probably see a live demonstration of the story right here on
the couch.
        ALEX: <shocked> Marta and Ling Ling would do that?  Here?
        NORIKO: They already did.
        MARTA: Yes, but at least we waited until everyone else left.

>Large breasts, capped by nipples that stood
>stiff in the air, skin without so much as a single strech mark.

        NORIKO: Of course not.  Anime women don't get stretch marks.
        MARTA: Yeah, pretty cool for us, neh?
        NORIKO: Well... now that you mention it...

>Ryoko's eyes slowly moved downward, to find a neatly trimmed
>thatch, and below, the mound of her sex, a small trail of clear,
>thick fluid dribbling out.

        ALEX: Ah geez! The oil pan is leaking!

>The small pink nub of her clit peeked out,
>and Ryoko couldn't resist reaching down to tweek it.

        ALEX: <Mechanic> I'll just tweak this with my trusty 22
milimeter...
        MARTA: You ever try using something like that on me and I'll
break every bone in your body.
        ALEX: <Gulps nervously>
        NORIKO: oh... I remember a slightly different comment during
that AMP Lemon.
        MARTA: And that's why I'll break every bone in his body.
        ALEX: <nervous> I was joking!

>Nagi shuddered, and arched her back as she touched it, shouted when
>Ryoko rolled it between her thumb and forefinger.

        ALEX: And this is supposed to be sensual?  It seems more like a
torture session to me.
        MARTA: Kid?
        ALEX: Yeah?
        MARTA: Don't knock it unless you've tried it.
        ALEX: How can I?  I'm not a woman.
        MARTA: No, but one day you'll be with one.

>        "Ahhhahhahhh!"  The trickle of fluid increased, dribbling down
>onto the couch

        ALEX: <Mechanic> So much for just plugging the leak. The whole
oil pan has to be replaced.
        NORIKO: Anime lemon cliche number 1.

>below them.  Ryoko slowly lowered her body, and took a gentle lap of
>the fluid, sending shivers up and down Nagi.
>She savored its sweetness, and then rose back
>up to kiss Nagi again, letting her taste herself in Ryoko's mouth.

        ALEX: Yuck!  At least get some mouthwash first!
        MARTA: K... never mind.

>Her hands found their way to Nagi's tits, and she began to kneed one,

        ALEX: And roll them and pound them so that they woud rise good
in the oven.
        MARTA: Do that and whatever woman your with is going to pound
*you*.  You're not dialing a radio you know.

>before bringing it to her mouth.  She sucked down on it,
>nibbling lightly on the tip of the nipple,
>her other hand tugging and pulling on the other side.

        ALEX: Ouch.
        MARTA: Not if you do right... hmmm... I wonder how long till
Ling Ling gets back from Australia?

>        Nagi's hands followed the curve of Ryoko's back to her buttoks,

>and around, to her underside.  Two fingers began to slide in the moist
canal
>between her legs, looking for an entrance.  Finding one, they entered,
probing,

        ALEX: That planet joke would just be so out of place here...
        NORIKO: What?  No Cartman 'anal probe' joke?
        ALEX: It wouldn't be tasteful.  [pause]  Oh crap...
        MARTA: <laughter>

>finding it fluid filled and hot.  Ryoko bit down,

        ALEX: *CRUNCH*

>not hard, but hard enough to raise a small cry
>from Nagi as her fingers slid into her pussy, and she gave a moan
>herself.  The fingers began to slide back and forth,
>wiggling as they did so, becoming sticky
>with juices.

        ALEX: Then wash your hands!

>Ryoko's ministrations to Nagi's breasts increased too, as she
>began to suck harder in pleasure.

[Marta produces a pad of paper and starts writing furiously]

        ALEX: Uh.. what are you doing?
        MARTA: Taking notes.

>        Nagi continued fingering Ryoko, now pushing in a third finger.
>Ryoko stiffened, and there was a rush of juices and heat to the area.
>  Ryoko let Nagi's tit slip from her mouth, and turned around,
>placing her rear in Nagi's face,

        ALEX: Don't stick that at people!  It's rude!
        MARTA: Go for it Ryoko!  Wine her, dine her and now 69 her!
        ALEX: '69'?
        NORIKO: Yes, it's a sexual position where two people <starts
making descriptive hand motions) place each other's heads between the
other's thighs and... <notices expression on Alex's face>  Are you okay?

>lowering her's to Nagi's pelvis.  For a moment, Nagi wimpered,

        ALEX: Nagi? Wimpered? That would be like Serena not whining or
C-ko cooking a great dish in a fanfic.
        NORIKO: Or Katsumi getting to work on time.

>wondering what she was doing, but, as Ryoko's mouth
>decended on her pussy, and her tounge started to ease its way in,
> she moaned loudly.  Seeing Ryoko's pussy bare inches
>away from her face, she lifted her head, and began to reciprocate.

        ALEX: Huh?  So Nagi fought back?
        NORIKO <sighing>: Nooo... it means she's returning the... uh...
uh... 'favor'.
        ALEX: Oh.

>Ryoko's body shook at the first touch of her tounge,
>shuddered as it entered her and began to
>probe.  Nagi tasted Ryoko, almost like a fine wine, rolling the
>salty-sweet taste around.

        ALEX: <British> Ah! The 1734 vintage... dry with just a bit of
aftertaste.
        MARTA <writing on pad>: Note to myself, get a bottle of plum
wine to pour *all* over Ling Ling and lick off.
        ALEX: Uh, Noriko?
        NORIKO: Yes?
        ALEX: Did I just give Marta a very sick idea?
        NORIKO: Yes.
        ALEX: Okay.  Just checking.
        MARTA: Erotic!  The world you're looking for is erotic!

>At the other end, Ryoko began to slide a finger into Nagi's
>pussy, in time with her tounge, and took pleasure at the feeling of
>Nagi's body stiffening once again.  She felt a sort of golden glow
>forming in the pit of her stomach, a warmth that began to
>radiate outward as Nagi continued.

        ALEX: Oh no!  It's the self-detonation technique from Dragonball
Z!!!

>        Nagi's concentration began to break up, as the waves pulsing
>from her pussy began to wear down her defenses, and she began
>to lose her sense of place.

        ALEX: I feel like that everytime I read one of these bad
fanfics.
        MARTA: Define 'bad'.

>It felt as though this amazing feeling had been going on forever, yet
she
>was certain it had only started a short while ago.  She continued to
lick
>and eat at Ryoko's pussy, slurping up the juices that were now starting

>to thin, and flow quicker with the heat being generated.

        ALEX: Be careful that she doesn't overheat or else the engine
will stall.
        MARTA: Man, this guy makes it sound like Ryoko's got an internal
furnace or something.

>Ryoko had begun to push two fingers into
>her, and was still tounging her,

        ALEX: Uh... wouldn't that be kind of a tight fit?
        MARTA <sighing>: Kid, that's the whole idea!
        ALEX: <worried> Are you getting mad at me?
        MARTA: No... you're too young to get mad at.

>and the feeling was reaching almost unbearable
>levels.  Nagi thought she would explode if it were to get any better...

        ALEX: See? They *are* about to do that suicide explosion from
Dragonball Z!
        MARTA: I'm going to suicide explode *you* in a minute.
        NORIKO: Marta, I do beleive you are enjoy this fic just a touch
too much.
        MARTA: And whatever gave you *that* idea?

>        And then it did, as Ryoko moved her mouth from Nagi's pussy to
>her clit, and began to suck down, hard, pushing it against her teeth
>with her tounge.

        MARTA & NORIKO <turn to look at Alex>
        ALEX: What?
        MARTA: Never mind.

>        "Oh GOOOODDDD!!!" The scream ripped out of Nagi's throat,

        ALEX: *RIP*
        MARTA: What?  Someone record my sister having sex?

>the waves of pleasure now a solid barage,

        ALEX: <makes gun firing noise>
        NORIKO: Barage?  What, some sort of boat?

>pushing her into senslessness and beyond.

        ALEX: Just like a Dr. Thinker fanfic.
        MARTA: Senseless ain't the word.  Ling Ling's enough to make me
loose my mind.

>Her back arched, and she began to buck.

        ALEX: What is she? A horse now?
        NORIKO: It's called an orgasm Alex.  Basically all your nerves
fire off at once and you briefly loose control of certain muscle
functions.
        MARTA: And is it ever great!  Men can piss standing up, and I
get multiple orgasms!  Who says there is no justice in the world?
        ALEX: <shocked> Noriko, is she like this *every* lemon you
ladies get?
        NORIKO: <laughing too hard to answer>

>The tounge at her clit switched back to her pussy,
>lapping up the juices that were pouring out of Nagi's love box.  She
>began to eat Ryoko at a mad pace, and it was not long before
>Ryoko too began to buck on top of her.

        ALEX: Now Ryoko is turning into a horse!
        MARTA and NORIKO: <sigh, shake heads>

>        "AhhhHHHHHHH!!!  So good, oh god, soo GOOODD!"
>Ryoko's juice exploded into Nagi's waiting mouth,

        ALEX: <ducks>
        NORIKO: <pops umbrella>
        MARTA: <sucks on a finger for a moment> Uhm... sweet.
        ALEX: <turns slightly green> urk...

>who licked and slurped as fast as she could.  But even
>with her best efforts, some escaped, pushing out of her mouth, and
>running down her cheek.

        ALEX: <P.A. voice> Spill on isle three.
        NORIKO: <snickers>

>Ryoko ground around above her, turning to face her.  She kissed her
>deeply, each other's juices mixing and creating something more.

        ALEX: Tang?
        MARTA: Love potion number 9.

>Exhasted, they feel asleep, locked together in a tangle of arms.

        MARTA: I can relate to that.
        ALEX: So they're playing twister now.

>***

        ALEX: Star light, star bright. First star I see tonight...
        MARTA: Three stars?  Hell,that previous scene was easily five
stars!

>        Ryoko awoke to a light pressure on top of her.  She opened her
eyes.
>        "Miya?"

        ALEX: ACK!!!

>Ryoko groaned, and sat up slowly, trying to remember where she was.
>Ryo-ohki jumped off of her, and bounded over to a nightstand.  "Miya!"
>She shook her head, and moved her hand.
>        On to a very wet spot on the couch.

        ALEX: And they didn't even clean up! The maid is going to be
ticked off!
        MARTA: Ohh... yuck.  I hate rolling onto the wet spot in the
middle of the night.
        NORIKO: That's far enough thank you.

>        Wet?  And... Sticky???
>        Memory flooded back with a start, of Nagi.  The taste of her,
>the feeling of her touching her...

        MARTA: Oh... I can't wait for Ling Ling to get back...

>        Where was she?

        ALEX: Gone on to a better fanfic.

>        "MIYA!!!" shouted Ryo-ohki, bringing Ryoko back to earth, so to

>speak.  She looked on the nightstand, and saw a piece of paper,
>carefully folded.  She walked over to it, and picked it up, opened it.
>Writen in a neat hand was:

        NORIKO: Dear John...

        ALEX: <Nagi> And believe me when I say that your taste in
clothing is terrible!
        MARTA: Yeah, but her taste in women isn't bad!

        ALEX: Nuts. All out of star jokes.
        NORIKO: Thank you.

>        "I'm going to school now!"
>        "Ok, have a good day, Tenchi!"

        ALEX: Even though that line was not added and we have no idea
who was speaking it, the author just decided to add it simply because he
felt like it!
        NORIKO: Wouldn't that have been Sasami?
        ALEX: No because this is taking place at the end of the series,
when Sasami is back on Jurai.

>        Tenchi stepped out of his door.  It was late spring, and cherry

>blosoms were falling, almost as if they were a pink snowfall,
>covering the ground.  As he walked down the path towards the school,
>he looked out, onto the lake, where Ryo-ou grew.

        ALEX: <Tenchi> Hmmm... gonna have to trim that pretty soon.
        NORIKO: Alex?
        ALEX: Yes?
        NORIKO: What is Ryo-ou?
        ALEX: Ryo-oh is the tree which is the brain and heart of Ayeka's
ship. Once the tree had fully regrown, it will become her ship again.
        MARTA: Ever notice that Tenchi is sorta like Dragonball Z?
Instead of Go- everything, it's Ryo- everything.
        ALEX: Yeah, but when was the last time that you saw Ryoko do a
Kamehamaha?

>From the tiny pair of leaves it had been when it had first popped
>up, to the sappling it had been when they had left to goto Jurai, now
>it was huge, the size of a two hundred year oak, and twice as strong.
>As he looked at it, Ryoko's words rang through his mind.

        MARTA <British accent>: One day my son, all this will be your.
        NORIKO <ditto>: What?  The curtains?
        ALEX: Oh come on! His mind's not hollow!

>        "Tenchi... We are having fun, aren't we?  Every day here is
>like a dream... I hope it'll be like this forever.  Tenchi..."

        ALEX: Hey!  It didn't go like that!  It was "Oh Tenchi!  Isn't
it so nice?  It's like a carnival every day.  *soft chuckle*  Oh I wish
these days could go on just like this forever and ever... Tenchi..."
        MARTA: Woah... Ryoko got the *good* acid!

>        He stopped, and looked up, as he had on that day, just like
>today, when Ryo-ohki the original had fallen to the Earth,
>half expecting to see a streak in the sky.

        ALEX: Huh... oh... what?

>Half expecting... And half wishing.  But the sky remained clear.  No
>streaks, no falling Ryo-ohki's.

        ALEX: No chances for a continuation.
        MARTA: Maybe the fic is over?

>        "Miya!"
>        Tenchi pivoted to the right, his eyes wide.  There, on the
>rock, was Ryo-ohki.  He just stared for a moment at her.
>And then, slowly, the cabbit collased into
>a black cat with white ear tips.

        ALEX: Oh no! The changlings have gotten to Earth again!

>        "Reow?" it meowed at him, and then jumped away, into the bush.
>He sighed, and continued on his way.
>        "Tenchiii...."
>        He whirled around.  Ryoko was standing behind him, hands on her

>hips, that half smile on her face.  He took a step toward her,
>reached out toward her... and she faded away.

        ALEX: I think Tenchi's been hitting the sake again.
        NORIKO: Or someone has been hitting him.

>Tenchi looked down, and shook his head.  He turned, and again,
>continued toward the bus.
>        Click-click.

        ALEX: Huh?
        MARTA: It's just that guy on the grassy knoll again.

>        Tenchi stopped, and slowly turned to face the sound.  Ryoko was

>there, standing on a rock.  Hands still on her hips,
>that half-smile still there.  And in her
>eyes... hope...  He stood there and stared for a moment.
>        "Hey."

        ALEX: 'Hey'? One of the women that you care for the most comes
back after disappearing with a life threatening wound and all you can
say is 'Hey'? What kind of uncaring jerk has the author made you to
be?!?!
        NORIKO: Alex, this is Tenchi, he's not exactly the brightest
bulb in the light string.

>        She jumped off the rock, and into Tenchi's arms.

        ALEX: <Tenchi> AHHH!!! *THUD*

>For a second, he almost expected her to fade away,
> but when his arms closed around her

        MARTA: - breasts.
        NORIKO: Him, *not* you.

>strange, exotic mix of hard and soft,

        ALEX: And this is possible, how?
        MARTA: Gimme a minute.
        ALEX: <Looks at Marta, confused and shocked, then shakes his
head>

>he swung her around, laughing.  He held onto her, not
>wanting to let her go.

        ALEX: <Ryoko> *GASP* Uh... Tenchi? I need to breath...
        NORIKO: She can survive deep space, I don't think so.

>        "I told you I was a space pirate, and a powerful one, and now
>I've come to steal you away," she said, poking a finger at him.

        ALEX: Poke, poke, poke...
        MARTA: You said that already.
        ALEX: I couldn't think of anything else.

>        "Ryoko, I thought..."  He trailed off as she shushed him.
>        "Now I'm not gonna do anything crazy.  I'm gonna track Ayeka
>down and win your heart in a fair fight."

        ALEX: Fair fight? No way! Ryoko's built on at least nine hundred
points while Ayeka's built on about five hundred.
        MARTA & NORIKO: <look at each other, all around the room and
then at Alex> And you know this how?
        ALEX: Would you believe... a wild guess?

>        "But..."  Ryoko laughed.
>        "Oh come on, you don't think that she's gonna give you up that
>easily!  I'm tellin you, I just know they're all coming back here."

        NORIKO: She, of course, has read the script.

>Ryo-ohki bounced toward them.

        ALEX: Boing, boing, boing...

>        "Miyow!!!!" she purred, obviously happy.  A falling cherry
>blosom landed on her nose, and she batted at it,
>trying to knock it off to no effect.  With a quaint
>sound, she sneezed it off.

        ALEX: <Ryo-oh-ki> Darn, hay fever is catching up again.
        MARTA: How cute, may I go puke know?

>"Meow!"  Ryoko hugged him to her, putting her mouth close to his ear.
>        "I'll tell you something, my Tenchi.  You know the carnival
>comes and goes.  If you wait long enough, it'll always come back to
you."

        NORIKO: Translation: what goes around comes around.

>He just held her for a
>moment, and looked off, into the sky.
>        "I guess you're right, Ryoko.  I guess you're right."

        ALEX: <Tenchi> After all, women are always right.
        MARTA & NORIKO <look at each other, then each drops an arm
around Alex's shoulders>: At least!  You're learning!
         ALEX: [shurgs and blushes] I try.

        MARTA: Help?  Help you?  Forget it!
        MAGIC VOICE: Your comments please?
        ALEX: Comments?  I thought we did those already.
        NORIKO: Actually, Magic voice means a critic's review of the
fanfic's quality.
        ALEX: Oh... well for the most part, it was well written.  There
were *some* lines that confused me and some spelling mistakes as well.
As for the characters themseves, I think the story could have done
witout the prelude to the sex scene between Ryo-oh-ki and Ken-oh-ki.
[shudders]  As for Nagi and Ryoko... uh... I... well... [blushes and
gets a nose bleed]
        MARTA: Do you always do that?
        ALEX: <slightly angry> Well, I'm not like you, ya know.
        MARTA <innocent tone>: What?  Sexually experienced?
        NORIKO: I for one found it to be yet another example of a
contrived plot with no other purpose than to feature two characters
having sex.
        MARTA: So?
        NORIKO: It is possible to have a story that examines the out
come of a character's first sexual encounter.  The obvious choices are
such characters as Ranma and Akane, Keiichi and Belldandy or even Tenchi
and Ayeka.
        MARTA: And what's wrong with the one we just read?
        NORIKO: Simple, it presumes once again that virtually every
female character anime character in existance has lesbian leanings.  At
times the writers seem to go out of their way to set up a situation
where two major female characters have sex, regardless of how impossible
such a situation would be.
        MARTA: Unhunh... so, you're trying to say that there are no
possible lesbian couples in anime?
        NORIKO: No... I mean, there are.  There's that pair from Sailor
Moon... and...
Kyosuke's cousin Akane... and...
        MATA: Melon and Non from Vanity Angel.
        NORIKO: Right.  But odds are, most of the couples the writers
come up with just don't make sense.  I mean, can you imagine *any* of
the woman in Tenchi Muyo sleeping with each other?
        MARTA <obviously thinking>: Uhm... Kiyone and Mihoshi.
        NORIKO: You're kidding.
        MARTA <shrugging>: It's the only one I can think of that seems
possible.  I mean, two women, cooped up for long patrols in a small
starship?  Sure, it could happen.
        NORIKO: And you would know.
        MARTA: Hmmm... I can think of a few more examples.
        NORIKO: Like who?
        MARTA: Easy.  The Puma Twins from Dominion.
        NORIKO: Get real, they're *sisters*!
        MARTA: Nope.  They're artifical constructions with virtually no
morals.  I can see them doing each other easy.
        NORIKO: And who else, Ms. Expert?
        MARTA: Let me see... <pause> The entire cast of Sailor Moon.  A
bunch of over-sexed girls running around in tiny costumes... yep, sounds
like an orgy in the works to me.  Then there's the popular Priss and
Sylvia angle.  Which is almost plausible.
        NORIKO: It is not!
        MARTA: Or Priss and Sylvie.  Well, that was one that might have
developed if she'd lived.
        NORIKO: You are hopeless.
        MARTA: Or Lebia and Rally.
        NORIKO: What?!!  You must be joking!
        MARTA: Ever see Rally or Lebia to have anything close to an
outside romantic relationship?
        NORIKO: No...
        MARTA: Okay then.  I could see them being secret lovers.  I
didn't say this was probable, just plausible.
        NORIKO: <sighs>
        MARTA: Oh.. and the obvious ones... Urd... and... uhm...
        NORIKO: And who?  There really isn't no one else in the series
that fits.
        MARTA <snaps fingers>: Mara!
        NORIKO: I... uh... wait... you're right.  half-demoness, full
demoness... I can actually believe that one.
        MARTA: And of course Kei and Yuri.
        NORIKO: Oh really?
        MARTA: Yep.  For the same reasons the I could see Kiyone and
Mihoshi.  Oddly enough, though, I've never found a Dirty Pair lemon
story.
        NORIKO: And I'll bet you've looked everywhere.
        MARTA: And there is the one true case that will never actually
happen.
        NORIKO: Which is?
        MARTA: Misty Brown and Rally Vincent.  It's pretty obvious that
Misty *loves* Rally, except that Rally *isn't* going to return her
affections.
        NORIKO: True... and it's probably only a matter of time before
someone writes the lemon story.
        MARTA: Yup.  Oh, and finally, we have Drakunn.  We have two
couples there, what with Rua falling for Rosalia and becoming her lover.

        NORIKO: And the other?
        MARTA: Well... I doubt  this will happen, but it gets me hot
thinking about it... Princess Karula and Princess Minerva together.
        NORIKO <shakes head>: Pathetic.  Alex, you have anything to say?

        ALEX: Well... [thinks for a moment] As for what you said Noriko,
I really can't comment.  I don't have much experience in that field and
saying anything would only serve to make me look like an idiot.  As for
the potential couples Marta suggested... [thinks for a moment and looks
uneasy] She has a lot of free time on her hands?
        MARTA: Hey?
        NORIKO: Admit it, you're obsessed with sex... especially sex
with certain women.
        MARTA: So?

[ A knock sounds from the door]

        ALEX: That should be my ride. [stands]  It was an honor riffing
the fanfic alongside you ladies.  [bows to Noriko and shakes Marta's
hand]  Maybe next time we could do this at the Anipike.
        MARTA: Yeah it was kinda fun.

[SCENE: Alexander opens the door, showing a young man wearing a black
tank top a dark blue bolero jacket and loose black pants.  The large
sword on his back and the purple hair easily indentify him as Trunks,
from Dragonball Z.  Both Marta and Noriko are shocked and try their best
to hide it]

        TRUNKS: Come on Alex, or else we're gonna miss karaoke night.
        ALEX: Kareoke night already?  Man, time flies.  [pause]  Oh,
would you like to meet Marta and Noriko?  They're the ones I was riffing
the fanfic with.

[SCENE: Trunks leans in and waves hello.  Both ladies wave back.  Noriko
doing her best to stay impassive and blank faced, while Marta is
twitching in her seat.]

        ALEX: Who knows, maybe Trunks will help us out next time?
        TRUNKS: Maybe...
        ALEX: Take care!
        NORIKO: Uh.. yeah, you too Alex.
        MARTA: Uhh...

[SCENE: Alexander leaves with Trunks,  chatting about the last singing
competetion.]

        MARTA <shakes head>: I don't think that was the real Trunks.
        NORIKO: What?  And how would you know?
        MARTA: I don't see Trunks singing karaoke.

[SCENE: Noriko stands up and walks to the door.  Marta follows close
behind.]

        NORIKO: Well... that was... interesting.  I'll be going now.
        MARTA: Right.  See ya.
        NORIKO: Unhunh.

[SCENE: Noriko leaves.  Marta closes the door and after a moments pause
locksthe door.  She then runs backto the couch.  The scene switches to a
rear view of the couch.  There is some odd noises and then Marta's boots
come flying back over the couch.  This is quickly follwed by the sound
of Marta unzipping her jumpsuit.]

        MARTA: Magic Voice, please run that again.
