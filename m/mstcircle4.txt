Full Circle Part 4
WRITTEN BY: Adam Chris Leigh
MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans a.k.a. JOLT!!!

This is my thirty-second MSTied fanfic and, after reading the AAA
Tournament, I must say that it's about time that I get back to riffing
the Full Circle series. I'm more dedicated now because I heard from a
friend that Adam is going to start on a OVA version of this series and
that will demand some *special* attention.

LEGAL STUFF: All the Anime characters in the following MST belongs to
the talented and creative people who made them. Please don't sue me for
I am merely borrowing your characters and not making any claim on them.
The Club Anipike belongs to Nightbreak, whom I am grateful to for
allowing me to use it.

Now, on to the story!

<Rei and Shampoo, already seated in their chairs, looked about the
theater as they waited for Washu's return.>
SHAMPOO: So who you think Washu get to help us riff fanfic?
REI: I don't know, but with Samantha stuck up on that satellite, we'll
need someone else to add more riffs.
SHAMPOO: Hope she do okay.
REI: Same here.
<Voices suddenly come from the door as Washu enters with the two new
MSTiers. Following Washu is Ryoko, dressed in her blue and gold striped
dress, and Mihoshi, who is dressed in her dress pants and pink tank
top.>
WASHU: And that's the story. So, you feel like helping?
RYOKO: Oh, no problem! Anything for Samantha.
MIHOSHI: Especially after the way she beat up Adam Chris Leigh.
WASHU: Speaking of which, that's whose story we're going to be MSTing
today.
RYOKO: <sighs> And here I thought he didn't make any more chapters.
MIHOSHI: Look at it this way, Ryoko. Who better to riff his stories then
the people he puts down the most!
<Ryoko nods and takes the fourth seat while Mihoshi sits in the fifth.
Washu takes her pace at the first and, summoning her microcomputer,
begins to type on it. After a few seconds, the fanfic starts up>

RYOKO: An arrogant jerk inserted himself into an Anime series and
rewrote its history.

settling

MIHOSHI: Huh? This thing is done in script!
WASHU: Well, lets just hope that it doesn't get made into a show.

RYOKO: Pluto? Is that *Sailor* Pluto?
WASHU: I'm afraid so.
MIHOSHI: Oh great, it's turning into a crossover with Sailor Moon.
REI: Hopefully, it's the Sailor Scouts and not the Senshi.

SHAMPOO: Putting on a little weight, Adam?
REI: He's not fat, he's just big boned.
WASHU: Either that or his ego is taking up allot of room.

SHAMPOO: Is this one of those author companies, like Foxfire
Productions?
MIHOSHI: Lets hope not. He might have a whole page with different
stories of inserting himself into the Tenchi Muyo world.

dark!

seventeen.

SHAMPOO: This more exciting then action sequence in Boba Fett meets
Pizza cats.
REI: You have got to be kidding.

better then this one.

MIHOSHI: Would it be considered too dark for us to cheer that Adam is
suffering?
WASHU: Hang on. <checks computer> Yes it would. In fact, we already used
up our quota of dark comments already. <looks at Ryoko>
RYOKO: <sheepish> Sorry.

REI: Wow! What a shock!
WASHU: Yeah. We actually used Nani despite the fact that this is in
English!
MIHOSHI: But how can the gems, which only Ryoko and the Tenchi-ken can
use, be imbedded in his hand?
RYOKO: I have this horrible feeling that not only is Adam Jurian, but
that he was created by Washu as well.
SHAMPOO: Actually, Adam *is* part Jurian. Samantha told me.
WASHU: Aeka is going to be pissed when she hears that.

RYOKO: Stupid globe. All that's on is reruns!

started 1200 years ago! It was 700 years ago that Ryoko got...

frustrated.

RYOKO: <growls and grits teeth together>
MIHOSHI: Hmm... Person is angry and proceeds to take it out on other
people, preferably the ones which are helping him. This leads me to
believe that Adam is very anti-social and would like to be left alone.
REI: Still working on that Ph.D. in Psychology?
MIHOSHI: Only a few more months and I'll get it!

RYOKO: <face in hands> I feel so ashamed...
MIHOSHI: And it would appear that Adam prefers beautiful women to drape
themselves about him in his fanfics in order to make up for what is
probably a lack of a love life in reality.
RYOKO: You guys know I wouldn't do this, right?
WASHU: We know, dear. Just be thankful that this is only a *script* for
a fanfic.

grammar. Failing to do so results in a loss of sight.
