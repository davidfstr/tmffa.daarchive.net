I don't own Tenchi Muyo! or any of it's related properties.  Pioneer,
the masters of animation, owns these characters and situations.

                A Letter

                To Sasami

        You've captured the hearts of many so very easily.  Ever since you
appeared on Tenchi Muyo!, many people have done many things in
appreciation.  The #SAS#, for example.

        But, with all you've done on the show, there is one thing you've done
that I doubt other fictional characters have done.  You've helped
someone in the real world.

        Througnout my life, I've been tormented.  But, as soon as I left the
school, my life became a scant better.  Long afterwards, I was depressed
and feeling dark.  But, one day, that all changed.

        One day, I saw the first four episodes of the Tenchi Muyo! OVA series.
I thought it was fun seeing Ryoko and Tenchi fight.  But, then I saw the
next episode.  I then saw Sasami for the first time.  And, like nothing
else, the darkness inside me started to fade.

        I was healed!  And, it was all thanks to one character.  Imagine that.
One anime character shattered the darkness within me.

        And that is why I want to say:  Thank you, Sasami!  <Bows respectfully>
