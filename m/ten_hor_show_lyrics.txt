		MARTIAL LEMON- ANIME EXPO

Ayeka: Vegeta was sayin'
       When Goku was a super saiyan
       That he just didn't care
       And Sakura was hurt 
       With a blowing skirt
       Cutey Honey was with The Dirty Pair
       Then something went wrong 
       Akira and Pokemon 
       Got caught in a door with their hair
       Then like a game player
       Firing a Kamehameha
       They let their clothes rip and then tear...

       When Yuffie stole things from Cloud 
       And I really felt great       
       When Tien tri-beamed a state-
       Sized hole for Cell in the ground  
       Duo said Trowa
       Had so much raw power
       That in his gundam he pleased all the crowd 
       I'll beat the ESUA
       Said Washu to Dr. Clay 
       'cause I'll shout my attack twice as loud

		OVER AT THE LEMONLIME PLACE

Achika:	In the limelit darkness
	Of the blackest fic
	There a sick, but intriguing glow
	No matter where or when you go

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light-

All:	Over at LemonLime place

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light

All:	Yellow fruits in the black of space

Achika:	There's a craving, craving for citrus 
in everybody's heart

Nobuyuki: 
	I can see the innocence
	I can see the youth
	It's the truth- but there has to be
	Something sexy behind the mask, I see

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light

All:	Over at the LemonLime place

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light

All:	Yellow fruits in the black of space

Nobuyuki:
	There's a craving, craving for citrus 
	in everybody's heart

Yosho:	The ecchi must come
	Through the pretence of your cover
	Show the humans below, let the clothes and 
	curves
	Reveal ourselves to each other

	To each other...

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light

All:	Over at the LemonLime place

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	There's a light 

All:	Yellow fruits in the black of space
	There a craving, craving

Nobuyuki and Achika:
	For citrus in everybody's heart

		THE LIGHT HAWK

Yosho:	It's so potent 
	Power's streaming
	Racial memories fill the mind 
	Watch up closely

Ayeka:	It's grip is much stronger!

Yosho:	My anger's makin' me blind  
	Ooo I remember
	Doin' the light hawk
	Fightin' those m-m-m-monsters when
	My tree would be waiting
	And Tsunami's voice calling-

Trio:	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!

Kagato:	It's just a wild flash of rage-

Trio:	Then those feathers of light

Kagato:	With your hands on the hilt

Trio:	You let the blade of ignite
	But it's that forward thrust
	That really deep-fries your brain-

	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!

Ayeka:  It's so groovy
	Ojosama to oyobi
	Bow to my ship-tree
	Or I'll kill you all
	In a psuedo-space vacuum
	I hope we'll be back soon
	Most of us will...but not all!
	With a kick and fast pace
	Adventures in Time and Space
	Just call me Princess... 
	don't say my name!
	In tune with your creation
	
Trio:	And spaced out on G.P. station!
	Let's do the Light Hawk again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk again!

Ryoko:  I was sittin' in the shrine
	Just a bidin' my time
	When a grey haired fool
	Brought me into crime
	Forced my mind
	Took me by suprise
	Had an enourmous sword
	And powers from Jurai
	Looked at me and I felt something
	I bowed to his light hawk wings-

Trio:	Let's do the Light Hawk again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk again!

	(tap dancing and whip cracking from Ayeka 
	accompained by moans) 

Trio:	Let's do the Light Hawk again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk again!

Kagato:	It's just a wild flash of rage!

Trio:	Then those feathers of light

Kagato:	With your hands on the hilt!

Trio:	You let the blade of ignite
	But it's that forward thrust
	That really deep-fries your brain-

	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!
	Let's do the Light Hawk Again!

		SWEET PAEDOMORPHIC

NOTE: Before anyone gets any ideas,
a Paedomorphic is a term for any species
in which the adult form is exactly the
same as the child form, ie. no change
in plumage/ colour, etc. So Washu IS
a paedomorphic, because she is an adult
who looks like a child.

Washu:	Oh, hello
	I see you've met my
	Pretty little sailors
	They're a bit upset
	Becuase, for their chamberette
	They're waiting for a new set of impalers  

	Don't get strung out
	By the way that I act cold
	Don't open, that gaping portal
	For a start I may only look 12 years old
	But in my heart I'm as good as immortal!
	I'm just a sweet paedomorphic
	From paediatric
	Pensylvania!
	
Washu and Chorus:
	(Uh huh)

Washu:	Let me open my doors
	Maybe you could show me yours
	You look a bit down in the weather
	But if you fancy something lighter
	But none the less tighter
	I'll swap a nurse's kit for this heavy leather

Nobiyuki:
	I'm glad we happened to fall 
	Could we make a call?
	We both need a little help starting 
	We'll just go from where we are 
	Back to the land of the stars
	We don't want to ruin your party...

Washu:	You got caught in the storm-  
	Well, that's a new one 
	Why don't you just tell me the truth?
	You've seen my picture before
	And you liked what you saw
	So you wanted to slip under my roof!
	I'm just a sweet paedomorphic
	From paediatric
	Pensylvania!

Washu and Chorus:
	(Uh huh)

Washu:	Why don't you...wait for the light

Chorus:	(light)

Washu:	Now, there's no need to fight 

Chorus:	(fight)

Washu:	I could show you my latest creation
	I've been makin' a boy
	For a CUDDLY toy 
	He's good for a little...elation!
	I'm just a sweet paedomorphic
	From paediatric
	Pensylvania!

Chorus:	(Uh huh) Hit it, baby!

Washu:	I'm just a sweet paedomorphic

Chorus:	(sweet paedomorphic)

Washu:	From paediatric
	Pensylvania!

Chorus:	(Uh huh)

Washu:	So, come on down to the crypt
	And have your inhibitions stripped
	Uh!
	I see you QUIVER with sa-tis-faction! 
	But...maybe your nerves
	Are what I observe
	So, I'll remove those fears
	But not...the action!

		THE MASTER KEY
Tenchi:	I think the master key is hanging over mah head
	And I've got a feeling someone's wishing me dead
	Oh, woe is me
	My life is a anime
	Oh, can't you see? 
	That I'm at the start of a very iyou ge-mu!

	I woke up this morning and a fantasy was realesed

Chorus:	(That ain't no vice)

Tenchi:	This sinning is a disbalance in my natural peace

Chorus:	(That ain't no vice)

Tenchi:	Oh, I feel a fool
	My Tenchi-ken is in full view
	And it's so true- 
	That I'm at the start of a very iyou ge-mu! 

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice
	That ain't no vi-i-ice!

Kagato:	Tenchi Horror, you need some advice
	I've come to tell you that your acting real nice
	As the product of that mad woman's sugar and spice
	Feeling bad, well, that's no vice

Chorus:	That ain't no vi-i-ice!

Tenchi:	I think the master key is hanging over mah head

Chorus:	(That ain't no vice)

Tenchi:	And I've got a feeling someone's wishing me dead

Chorus:	(That ain't no vice)

Tenchi:	Oh, woe is me
	My life is an anime
	Oh, can't you see? 
	That I'm at the start of a very iyou ge-mu! 

Chorus: Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice
	That ain't no vi-i-ice!
	Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice

Tenchi:	Oh no no no no

Chorus:	Sha la la la that ain't no vice
	That ain't no vi-i-ice!
	Sha la la!

I CAN MAKE YOU ASCEND!

Washu:	A Saiyan
	Only 3 ft tall
	Gets an anureism
	If you say that he's small
	His son beats him still
	And soon on a hill	
	The anger and hate
	As he hovers and waits
	Will make him insane and irate
	The humilition will grate
	He'll be trapped
	In one state 
	He'd be a strong man 

All:	But not a blonde man

Washu:	He'll shadow box, run
	And do what he should
	Try to understand what makes heros good
	Such an effort!
	If he only listened to his friend...
	In just 1 day in my chamber...
	
All:	I can make you ascend! 

Washu:	He'd do tribeams, 
	And flares
	Gatling gun and big bang
	I think that kind of training
	Really must ruin a man 
	No more frustrated screaming-
	When you see what I can lend
	1 day in my chamber...

All:	And I'll make you ascend!

		GOSH GOLLEY, HOKEY POKEY

Mihsohi:
	What every happened to that Tokyo bar?
	When you ate your Sushui and felt like a star
	It don't seem the same since I came so far
	Sung my favourite songs
	And though I was a Goddess

	I used sing with my partner Kiyo
	Listen and sing to Duran Duran with 'Rio'
	A mic and a song with a bit of luck
	You'd sing through the night
	And you might even
	Have a high score!

Mihoshi and Chorus: 
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoke!
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoko!

Mihoshi:
	Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
	My lips used to sing to music without thought
	My mind would remember all I'd ever been taught
	I'd touch the heart of my partner
	And thats when my breath caught
	She would whisper in my ear
	That she really was my mistress

	Get back to the bar and ask for a bag
	While the next couple's song would really drag
	You put your hands on the mic
	Try not to let yourself lag
	It felt really good cos'
	You always had a
	High Score!

Mihoshi and Chorus:
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoke!
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoko!
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoke!
	Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoko!

Mihoshi: (screams)

		I CAN MAKE YOU ASCEND! (reprise)

Washu:	...but a melee glow and some big hair
	A charged attack and a evil stare
	Makes me smileeeeeeeeee
	Makes me wanna kiss 
	Nahoko Hasagawa (or Akira Toriyama) for her 
	(his) style
	1 day in my chamber and...

All:	I can make you ascend!

Washu:	I don't want no raw power...
	Just someone I can devour!

Achika:	We want Saiyan men!

Washu:	1 day in my chamber...

All:	And I can make you ascend!

Washu:	It's alright in the end...

All:	1 day in the chamber and...she can make you 
	ASCEND!

		TENCHA-TENCHA-TENCHA-TENCHI
Ryoko:	I was feeling alone
	On my own
	I'd never seen a guy before

Achika: Just like us!

Nobuyuki: Uh huh.

Ryoko:	Mum would never let me
	Men could never pet me
	But now I need a boy
	Who's out to get me

	Now all I want to do
	Is find a man that's true
	I've waited far to long to stall
	I'll lower my sheild for you 
	I want blood, through and through
	You've got a single bed 
	But I've got one for two!  

	Tencha-Tencha-Tencha-Tenchi
	I could handle a senshi 
	But your my passion, my ecchi
	So let me taste and bite

	Then if you run and hide
	I will chase you inside 
	I'll make it so hard for you to call
	Maybe bind and gag you 
	Down to my cave 
	I'll drag you 
	You've got to have a freind
	And I've got to have you!

	Tencha-Tencha-Tencha-Tenchi
	I could handle a senshi 
	But your my passion, my ecchi
	So let me taste and bite

Chorus: (starts up 
	"Gosh Golly, Hokey Pokey-
	I really love that Kareoko"
	in the background)

Ryoko:	Tencha-Tencha-Tencha-Tenchi
	Get down on that Bench-i
	That place that you send me
	To feels so right
	
	Tencha-Tencha-Tencha-Tenchi
	I don't need any other men-shi
	All this passion might end me
	So hold me till the light

Tenchi: Hold you till the light?

Nobuyuki: 
	Hold me till the light

Washu:	Hold me till the light

Achika: Hold me till the light

Yosho: 	Hold me till the light

Ayeka: 	Hold me till the light

Tenchi: Hold me till the light

Ryoko: 	Hold me...till the light!
              
		SWEET LITTLE CHILD

Nobuyuki:	
	Sweet little child
	I don't want to hurt you
	But you look so out of place and
	All alone 

	It isn't right 
	For you to be lonely
	You look around
	The child you found
	In a second she is go-owa-owa-owa-owa-ne

	And that was the pace
	That she moved
	And made herself...disappear
	The cuter it's face
	The easier 
	To sooth the wounds
	You hear something
	About a girl
	With a magic stone

	So baby, don't cry
	You're a super hero
	After you fight, there's a helping hand
	And they'll be your mother
	And your father
	So dry your tears
	I'll calm your fears
	It'll be okay

	And that's all the thought
	That she used 
	To put her trust...in me
	So give me a kiss
	Little girl of mine
	You look around
	The one you found
	Is your own child-

Chorus:	Is your own child

Nobuyuki:	
	Is your own child-

Chrous: Is your own child

Nobuyuki:
	Is your own child-

Chrous: Is your own child

Nobuyuki:
	Is...your...own...chiiiiiiiiild

		MIHOSHI'S KAREOKE

NOTE: Yes I know I've used the word
'Kareoke' in two songs now, but there
are only so many words which rhyme
with 'Mihoshi'.

Kiyone: From the day we were paired
        She was trouble
        She was the straw
        On the camel's back
        I tried in vain...

Kagato: But she never even got close to sane
 
Kiyone: She very nearly made me snap!
        From the day she was gone 
        All she wanted
        Was eechi candy corn
        And an amped up mic
        S-S-S-Singing through the night

Kagato: She was a blonde who was never that bright

Kiyone: Stickin' the phones in the jack 

Chorus: When Mihoshi'd go see Kareoke
	You knew her mind was made of fuzz
	But when she stole the ship 
	And stuck out her lip

Washu:  She's so bad!

Achika: Makes you mad-

Kiyone: And I was. 

Ayeka:	Everybody balmed her 
	We very nearly shamed her
        I said hey listen to me
        This is no place for a sweet little pea
        But she closed her eyes and ears 
        To my kind plea

Kiyone: But her blonde head must have been turned 
	By the high life
        Making her spurn me
        In a note so rude:

Chorus: Was she mean? Was she mean?
                    
Mihoshi:I don't give a damn
        
Kagato: I found a real wo-man

Mihoshi:I'll help her carry out her evil coup

Chorus: When Mihoshi'd go see Kareoke
	You knew her mind was made of fuzz
	But when she stole the ship 
	And stuck out her lip

Washu:  She's so bad!

Achika: Makes you mad-

Kiyone: And I was. 

Chorus: When Mihoshi'd go see Kareoke
	You knew her mind was made of fuzz
	But when she stole the ship 
	And stuck out her lip

Washu:  She's so bad!
                   
Chorus: Whoa ho ho
                
Achika: Makes you mad-
                   
Chorus: Hey hey hey

Kiyone: And...I...was. 

Chorus: 'hoshiiiiiiiiii.

		CREATURE FEATURE

Washu:	Creature, feature, 'chika!
	I've told the truth
	Won't tell a lie
	You'd better dry up
	Ms. Jurai
	I've tasted all
	Your apple pie
	And it's not that sweet,
	Ms. Jurai
	I've shown you love
	And flown from up above
	Your as yuri as Nick Fury
	Wound up like a Sailor Scout on smack
	When you made it,
	Did you hear the whip crack?
	Stop that glide high
	Get down from the sky
	You'd better dry up
	Ms. Jurai
	The Washu-nator
	Will line and bait ya'
	It's like a fornicater-
	A million minds messed up by mine!
	You'd better dry up
	You'd better dry up
	Zip your fly up!
	You'd better dry up... 
	
Kagato:	And then she flares up-

Achika:	Noooooo!

Washu: 	Don't open that gaping portal 
	I may look young but, I'm immortal

Nobuyuki: 
	Your a young one, but you'd better not try
	to hurt them, Washu-chan!

		ECCHI MY WORLD

Ryoko:	  It was great when I came with Mum
	  All we did was have a load of fun
	  But she wanted another chum
	  And started working on a teenage son
	  Now the only thing in my heart that stirs
	  Is that same little boy of hers	
	  Ecchis my world
	  Keeps me safe from the crueller things
	  Yeahhhh!!!!	

Tenchi:   I'm up a creek as long as the Nile 
	  Completely confused and riled
	  Tell Washu that though she has style
	  I am not a peodophile!
	  Now the only thing I've got to know
	  Is all the contours of my Ryok-o
	  Ecchis my world
	  Keeps me safe from the crueller things

Nobuyuki: It's a bad dream...
	  Help me, I scream 
	  Everything is not 
	  As it seems
	  Take this ecchi away
	  What's this? Washu-chan?
	  Ooo...I feel like a man...
	  I thought she was a lesbi-an
	  But here she comes a-gain, gain

Achika:   Oooohhh
	  I feel a-light
	  Nose bleeds are alright
	  It really is a shocking site
	  Hentai is here
	  The show has changed cerificate
	  It's higher now, and I feel great
	  The time is now, don't be late
	  Your base desires steer!

		DON'T FIGHT IT- WRITE IT

Washu:	What ever happened
	To Chibi Moon?

Ryoko:	That tiny, pink little freind
	
Washu:	As she came on the screen
	
Ryoko:	How I would cheer and scream

Both:	Cos' I knew how her story should end

Washu:	Until the fics over	
	Don't worry about truth 
	Treasure or break 
	The innocence of youth
	Lakes of purity
	To taint with tiny drops
	And oily cess-pools
	Where the fun never stops
	Can't you all sight it?

Chorus and Washu:
	Don't fight it, write it
	Don't fight it, write it 
	Don't fight it, write it
	Don't fight it, write it

Kiyone:	Oh, we've got to get out this cage
	Before this...CITRUS!
	Defiles our minds
	I've got to brave
	And be no woman's slave
	Or else...my nerves will...rage...
	And my life
	Will be lived
	For the limes!

All:	Don't fight it, write it

Nobuyuki: 
	It's a bad dream...
	Help me, I scream

Achika:	God bless J. Padilla!

		I'M ON MY OWN

Washu:	When I made my decision through the pain

All:	Damn it all

Washu:	Was all I that I was saying 

All:	Now I've had a fall

Washu:	Want to be grown up again

All:	Break down the wall

Washu:	Please beckon and keep me sane 

	Cos' I been tricked by
	All the youth, the youth and the tries
	And besides- it hasn't helped
	I'm still on my own

	Everywhere I have been alone

All:	Try to fit in

Washu:	Since my loved ones left home

All:	Avoiding all the sin

Washu:	So I sought refuge in my womb
	Cos' I've seen
	Truth through the lies
	The truth, the truth
	In your eyes 
	And I
	Can't disguise it
	I'm on my own
	I'm on my own

		SUPER SAIYANS

Nobuyuki:
	I've done my best
	God knows I've tried
	To save myself
	Even though I've...I've been defiled
	But now I know
	That Washu will never

All:	Eat (me)

Achika:	Ooo and Super Saiyans
	Fly away
	To leave their fights to
	Another day 
	And all I know 
	Is they will never

All:    Beat (us)

Kagato:
	And, somewhere in
	The hero's place
	Some little girl
	Not of their race
	Who was lost in Adventures
	In Time and Space
	Has freed them

All:	Freed (them)
