Notes: Here is a little poem I wrote for
Nobuyuki and Achika, who have always seemed
two of the most tragic characters in Tenchi.
I'm sick of Nobu-san getting the bum rap from
everyone- the poor man is a lonely soul.
So here is a poem for him.

LAMENT FOR ACHIKA

I hear your voice in the spirit-weathered winds
I see your face in the ripple riddled water
I sing our song through the clear crisp air
And wonder
If I am simply dreaming

I sense your presence in my sleepy soft existence
I wait for your touch in the never ending night
I cry for your love in the whirlpool of wonders
Which revolves
Around my little world

I hope for your touch in my lonely longing life
I dream about our love in this hormone hautned house
I remember how it felt in the sweet scented summers
But most of all
I wish you were still with me
To see your free and fevered family
To see your sought after son
To be with me through all of this
Until my days are done

END

I hope you liked that...I think it is the sweetest
thing I have written so far. But of course, I'm no
judge. Please let me hear what you thought of it-
Yrs.
