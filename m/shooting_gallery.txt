"Took your time, didn't you?"

"I needed to be sure of my target, sir."

Zed turned and looked at the targets. The most obvious in the frozen
holographic crowd was the big thing that looked like the Tazmanian Devil
from the Warner Brothers cartoons. Next to Taz was a really ugly sucker that
looked like some pissed-off god had given it a fishhook for a head. And at
the back of the horde was a little read-headed girl flat on her back, with a
bullethole in her chest.

"And why did you decide that she had to die?"

"She was the only one that seemed dangerous."

"And you came to that conclusion how?"

"The hookheaded freak there can't have any brains in that thing- they're
probably in that bean-bag thing with the umbilical. He ain't carrying it, so
he wasn't coming at me. And that thing looks like it's snarling, but it's
got a kleenex in it's hand. Sneezing at you isn't a threat- unless you're
real close- and he ain't even looking at us, if you look at his eyes.
     "The girl, though... didn't look right. the smirk is too old, and the
stance was wrong. And why is she here? She doesn't even look like a threat,
and noone's holding her hostage.
     "And look at those books. They're way too advanced for her."

Washu sat up with a start. "NO THEY ARE NOT!"
