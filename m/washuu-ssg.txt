Narrator: Hello, today on "baka-chan's morals through anime" we learn 
why we should listen to people who are smarter than us, enjoy.
Washuu: Finally my greatest invention is complete!
Mihoshi: Ooh! What does THIS button do? **Pushes a button**
Washuu: No Mihoshi, no!
Mihoshi: **prancing about Washuu's lab as she destroys everything** hee 
hee hee hee hee...
Washuu: Stupid galaxy police officer Mihoshi
**Dexter walks in**
Dexter: Okay hold it! This is too scary I was channel surfing when I 
came across this show, you have an exact replica of my life, what odd 
cameras do you plant in my house that you do not believe that I Dexter, 
boy genius will not find? 
Washuu: Right...
Mihoshi: HI DEXTER!
Dexter: Dee Dee I told you to stay out of my lab! Oh sorry...Well I 
must go, and why is your show called "Washuu's lab"?
Washuu: because.... It's so PERFECT!
Dexter: Whatever, goodbye?
Washuu: (turns to the camera) Hello! As you know by now, this is story 
eight in a 12-story saga but this is a very important issue. I will 
show you Masaki house everyday events and how life can be destroyed! 
Remember, To be a good leader, you must lead, not boss, I made it up 
myself. Peace.
Washuu: Please Mihoshi don't kill Ryo-Ohki
Ryo-Ohki- MYAH!!!!!!!
Mihoshi: But Wasuu! *Bites Ryo-Ohki's neck*
Washuu: Mihoshi! You know the whole point of this is to listen to 
people who are smarter than you!
Mihoshi: Oh Washuu! I didn't kill her I just- (looks at Ryo-ohki) AH! I 
killed her!
Washuu: Oh REALLY!?
*Upstairs*
Washuu: Hello Ryoko!
Ryoko: Get lost!
Washuu: If I were You Ryoko, I wouldn't eat so many cheesy poofs, I'm 
not one for you being a bounty hunter, but I don't want you killed.
Ryoko: Put a sock in it, my show's on!
Washuu: Suit yourse-elf! Same for you Kiyone, Galaxy police officers 
need to stay in shape to catch people like Ryoko!
Kiyone: SHHHH! This is the best part!
Washuu: I'm gonna go see what Ayeka and Sasami are doing,
Ryoko and Kiyone: GO!
***
Washuu: Hello Ayeka! What are you doing? 
Ayeka: Who me?? Uh...n-nothing!
Washuu: Ayeka...
Sasami: She's spying on Tenchi!
Ayeka: SASAMI!
Washuu: Ayeka...What did I tell you about trying to be better than 
Ryoko?
Ayeka: Do only what you can because nothing good will come if you don't 
act how you really are...
Washuu: Good! So how long have you been spying on him?
Sasami: Since she arrived!
Ayeka: SASAMI!
Washuu: And Sasami, you shouldn't get into other people's business, 
you'd be surprised how much damage it could cause in an anime! (Refer 
to Baka-chan's moral #1)
Sasami and Ayeka: Please go away...
Washuu: Let's see what Tenchi's doing,
*In the Carrot field*
Washuu: Picking carrots for Ryo-ohki?
Tenchi: AH! Washuu you scared me, yes I am.
Washuu: Ryo-ohki is dead Tenchi, there is no need to break your back 
for something that does not exist.
Tenchi: Oh...Well we need carrots anyway!
Washuu: whatever you sa-ay...
***
	Well the carrots sat in the shed until they rotted, Kiyone and 
Ryoko both did gain 10 pounds and couldn't fit in their uniforms, 
Kiyone was fired. Soon a drought came and they were so hungry they ate 
the rotten carrots and died weeks later. Mihoshi got an unknown disease 
for drinking alien blood and died as well. Tenchi found out about 
Ayeka's spying and Sasami gave him all the details, in which Ayeka slit 
her throat in her sleep, Ayeka was put on death row. Nobuyuki was so 
sad and depressed about all the pretty girls' deaths, that he killed 
himself. As for the grandpa he went crazy for witnessing his son's 
death. As for Tenchi he killed himself because of all the deaths and 
Washuu was burned at the stake because everyone thought she was a witch 
for predicting that bad things would come if no one listened to her.
Narrator: So we see why we should listen to people who are smarter than 
us, until next time keep this in mind and think about this story the 
next time you disobey the genius of the class.
