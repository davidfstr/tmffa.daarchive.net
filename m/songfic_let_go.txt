I will stay with you, though you think I’m playing
Watch you cringe though I am teasing
While we fight over who will win you
I will spend my life, in this endless journey
Never stopping to consider
That someday we might come to closure

I’ll never lose my dream
I’ll never lose my love
‘Cuz I’ll hold you babe
And I won’t ever let you go
‘Cuz even when I’m teasing you
My heart never stops its hoping
I still want you babe
And I won’t ever let you go

Holding onto to you
Hearing your gentle voice
Wondering if you’ll ever tell me
Than I hug you tight
And hope we’ll always be together
I want to hold this moment with you forever
Forever and ever

I’ll never lose my dream
I’ll never lose my love
‘Cuz I’ll hold you babe
And I won’t ever let you go
‘Cuz even when I’m teasing you
My heart never stops its hoping
I still want you babe
And I won’t ever let you go

I won’t ever miss one laugh
I won’t ever miss one tear
I’ll be at your side
I’ll stick by you through all eternity
Even when time comes to an end
Feel your soul so close to mine
And just hope that someday you’ll say the words
    that I long to hear
Someday, someday

I’ll never lose my dream
I’ll never lose my love
‘Cuz I’ll hold you babe
And I won’t ever let you go
‘Cuz even when I’m teasing you
My heart never stops its hoping
I still want you babe
And I won’t ever let you go
