Zetsura slowly opened his eyes.  The room was still dark, but the familiar
chair in which he sat, combined with the whiff of lemon-freshness that always
seemed to fill this room, triggered his memory.

*I must have fallen asleep during that last lemon* he thought.  *They've been
so predictable, recently.*

Zetsura called for the lights and the dim theater sconces illuminated the room.
The memorecorder hovered nearby, patiently storing his thoughts and actions
