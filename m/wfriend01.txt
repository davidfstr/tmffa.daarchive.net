Quick author's foreward:

This joke-shortfic takes place in the OAV continuum, due to the nature
of who-meets-who and when better fitting this story than the TV series.

              Tenchi Muyo!  "With Friends Like These..."

                           by Shunsuke -|||

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tenchi was working alone in the garden, having asked Sasami to watch 
over Ryo-Ohki while he tended to the carrots.  It was back breaking 
work, but satisfying to him.  

In the middle of planting a new row, he saw a flash of light on the
edge of his vision and heard a sonic boom that followed.  He looked 
up and saw a space ship hurtling down, threatening to crash into him 
and his fields, but it pulled up only a few hundred feet from the 
ground.  The initial scare having passed, Tenchi noted that it was a 
Galaxy Police cruiser, much like Mihoshi's which had crashed not so 
long ago.

Dropping his tools and bags, Tenchi ran toward the ship which was now 
preparing to land in a clearing beyond a stand of trees.  He made his 
was through them as fast as he could to finally see it.  As it came 
into his view, the doors to the ship opened and out walked a girl, 
her hair black as night, and with a thin frame that poorly wore the 
GP uniform that was draped over her body.

Tenchi could see she was in trouble, that this girl was barely able 
to stand, let alone fly a space ship.  In his ever-present good 
hearted nature, he walked toward the ship to help her.

"Hello, are you alright?" he called.

The girl, standing at the top of the stairs collapsed to her knees 
and gasped, then spoke.

"Is this Earth?" she spoke in a robotic monotone.

"Y-yes, it is..."

"I have found where I seek.  The trail...the signature signal...
her ship is here."

Tenchi walked up the stairs in wonder, halfway between fear and 
compassion, as he reached her and helped her stand.

"Here, Miss, let me help you," he said as he lifted her to her 
feet and walked her down the stairs to the ground.

"You must help me...I need," she stuttered intermittently, "I 
must find them..."

"Who?" Tenchi asked.

"I must find and kill Mihoshi," she said, "And I need thirty
thousand friends to do it.  Will you be one?"

Okay, another dumb idea from my mind, but what do you expect by now?
