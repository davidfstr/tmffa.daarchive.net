<JS>  Hello again, and welcome to Norad III, the MSTing Battlecruiser.  
As always, I do not own these characters, except for myself, and of 
course I don't own any characters in the MSTed fic.  Megaman X  belongs 
to Capcom, Washu Hibiki belongs to Pioneer, Meis Triumph belongs to 
Atlus and Red Company, Samus Aran belongs to Nintendo, and Captain 
Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company and Warhammer 40K belongs to 
Games Workshop.  With that said, on to the descriptions of our heros, 
and then to the MST.
Also, my spellcheck is broken, so there may be a few mistakes.  You will 
also have to read my last MSTs to get some of the jokes in this one.

NEVER FORGET 9-11-01

These are the tales of the crew of the Terran Battlecruiser Norad III.  
They were trapped there by Dr. Wily, who forces them to read bad 
fanfiction.

<JS>  And, just to give you an idea of what we look like, here are some 
descriptions.

JS:  Formerly a bald human seventeen-year-old, but was recently changed 
by Washu to have one attribute from each MST crew member.  He now has an 
arm cannon called the J-Buster, a blue sword called the J-Saber, a 
helmet with ocular sensors in it, acid spit, and he didn't want anything 
from Meis.

Megaman X:  Last robot created by Dr. Light before his death.  Now leads 
the Maverick Hunters thirteenth unit, as Captain.  Can interchange armor 
parts, and use a variety of weapons.  Wearing the Ultimate Armor; a 
black and cool-looking armor that allows him to hover in midair, take 
lots of damage, and use a special Giga Attack.  For this time around, 
armed with the weapons from Megaman X4.

Samus Aran:  A bounty hunter from deep into the galaxy, her family was 
killed in a space pirate attack.  Wears a special suit of Power Armor 
that was built by the Chozo, or Bird-People. This version of the armor 
is the Varia suit.  Armed with an array of different energy beams, that 
can charge up to become more powerful.  Has optical sensors built into 
helmet for better sight in the dark.  Hates all perverts, especially 
Meis.

Washu Habuki:  One of three Goddesses:  Herself, Tokimi, and Tsunami.  
Self-proclaimed "Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe", and nobody 
except maybe Yume has the brains to contest that title.  Wears her old 
Science Acadamy clothes, and is armed with her Holoputer.  She is 
20,000+ years old.  Also has a small forcefield generator, because of a 
certain pervert's continued insults toward a certain purple-haired 
princess.  Has her hair inside a hat, so that it doesn't catch on fire 
in case anyone decides to use fire weapons.

Meis Triumph:  Possibly the luckiest guy in the world.  He has twelve 
beautiful women all falling for him, and he isn't afraid to date them 
all!  Wears a cloak, goggles, white pants, and a brown shirt.  Has his 
trusty W-Blade at his side, and also can call upon many powerful beasts 
of magic to aid him. (For example, if Samus was trying to kill him 
again, he would summon Aquoon, the water dragon.) Probably the biggest 
pervert in the world, and proud of it.  Has a high threshold for pain, 
possibly because of the constant beatings he gets from the other MSTers.

Captain Invictus of the Ultramarines First Company:  From the year 
40,000, is second-in-command of one of the most powerful Space Marine 
Chapters in the galaxy, the Ultramarines. They are one of humanity's 
greatest achievements.  He is eight feet tall, wears a suit of 
Terminator Armor.(Very large, bulky suit of all-enclosing mechanical 
armor, increases senses and reaction time one-hundred-fold.)  Armed with 
a Storm Bolter(Huge double-barreled gun with detonate-on-contact 
ammunition) and a glowing blue Power Sword.(four foot long blade, with a 
matter-disrupting field around it.  Basically allows him to cleave 
through anything) Has three hearts, four lungs, can spit acid, see in 
the dark, hear a pin drop from a thousand paces, run at speeds of up to 
thirty miles per hour, and can do just about anything else yo can think 
of, except fly.(Well, besides when Samus boots him up to the rafters, 
but that's not really flying)  Also wearing an Iron Halo, which gives 
him a powerful forcefield.

-------Inside Norad III's rec room--------

(It's just another typical day on Norad III.  JS is playing Playstation, 
Meis is looking at some porno mags, and Samus is priming her gun to 
shoot Meis who is looking at porno mags.  Washu is having some Sake, 
Invictus is chatting with X, and Zero is having a drink with Washu)

<JS> (Playing Grand Theft Auto III) This sure is fun!  Although those 
damn cops keep busting me!  Then again, maybe that's because I keep 
blowing up their cars.
<Meis>(ogling at a picture) Oh yeah, I want HER number!*BLAMBLAMBLAM* Ha 
ha, you missed me!
<Samus>  Damn you Meis, stand still so I can kill you!
<Zero>  Washu, I think you've had enough to drink.
<Washu> (Drunk) Nawww, give me shum more o' that shtuff....
<Zero>  Okay, but this is the last one! (pours her another shot)
<Washu> (Drinks the Sake)  Ohhh, zat hitsh the shpot! (Falls unconcious)
<Zero>  ^__^; I knew I should've stopped her from having any more to 
drink!
<JS>  GODDAMMIT I DIED AGAIN!  That damn Columbian Cartel!
<Invictus>  So, X, got any more weapons chips I can have?
<X> (Trying not to smile evilly)  Well, I do have one more to spare.....
<Invictus>  Really?  What is it? 
<X>  It's called "Frost Tower".  I don't want it, so here. (Hands 
Invictus a computer chip)
<Invictus>  Gee, thanks! (Installs chip into armor)  FROST TOWER! (Turns 
into an ice cube)
<X>  And THAT'S exactly why I don't want that one!
--------Incoming transmission--------
<Wily>  How are my test subjects doing? (glances around the room and 
sees:  Invictus is inside an ice cube while X is laughing his ass off at 
him, Washu is unconcious, JS is smashing the Playstation all to hell, 
Zero is cleaning up behind the bar, and Samus is beating on Meis) ^__^; 
Oh, I see.
<Meis>  I can't take it any more!  AQUOON!
<Samus>  Oh boy.  (Aquoon appears and grabs Samus)  HELP!
<Meis>  You should've remembered I have THEM.  Oh, well.  Aquoon, do 
with her as you please.  (Aquoon grins evilly)  <Samus>  PERVERT!!!! 
(Starts blasting Aquoon)
<Aquoon>  OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!  OKAY, that's enough! 
(Let's go of Samus, then walks over to Meis)  Having the crap beaten out 
of me is NOT in the job description!  I'm outta here! (Fades away)  
<Wily>  Getting back on track, It's time to have you do another MST.  
This one is not a lemon.
<JS>  YAY!
<Meis>  BOO!
<Wily>  It's a crossover with Megaman X and Tenchi Muyo.
<X and Zero>  WHAT?!
<Wily> I know, I know.  So everyone, get in there!  And X, defrost 
Invictus!
<X>  Oh, fine.
<JS>  Wait!  Washu's out cold!  Who will take her place?  Hmmm.....(Zero 
is sneaking away)  Oh, Zero!
<Zero>  EEP!  Aw crap, do I have to?
<Wily>  Yes, you do.  I command you to.
<Zero>  (Sarcastically)  I obey your every whim, oh great and powerful 
master.
<Wily>  Watch your tone, or I'll have you dissassembled!  Now get in 
there!
-------All enter the theater-------
<JS>  All I can say is that it had better be a good fic.

MegaManX 

<X>  Great, he's already misspelling my name.   It's "Megaman X", not 
"MegamanX"!

and all other  MegaManX characters are licened and 

<Invictus>  How unsanitary.  This person has lice.
<Samus>  Keep him away from me!

owned by Capcom. Tenchi Muyo! and all Tenchi Muyo! are licened 

<JS>  Geez, all the Tenchi Muyo cast have lice, too?
<Meis>  What do you expect with all that hair?

and owned by Pioneer.
This fanfic was written by W. Showers  

<Zero>  He should use some lice medicine while he takes his Showers to 
get rid of those pesky critters.

Email MShowmoney@AOL.com 

<All>  SHOW ME THE MONEY!

	  This fanfic is  a crossover between Mega ManX and Tenchi 
Muyo! The second in the series I have written.

<JS>  Hey Wily, why are we MSTing the second part?
<Wily>  I couldn't find the first one.

	  In the previous fanfic MegaMan X and Zero fought Sigma 
and the X hunters. 

<X> I destroyed those guys a LONG time ago.

After X and Zero trash the hunters 

<X>  See?

Sigma 
opens a time and space warp 

<All>  (Singing) LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAAAAIN!!

taking them to the Tenchi Muyo! 
universe. Zero enlist the help of Tenchi and friends. 

<JS>  I have noticed, a lot of these authors have been infected with 
Shampooitis.

In the 
chase for Sigma,  Zero and Washu fall in love. 

<Zero>  WHAT?!  Oh, I am SO glad Washu isn't here right now to hear 
this.

Sigma takes off 
into space, X  follows him in his own ship. Ryo-Ohki is hurt to 
the point it can't turn into a spaceship. 

<JS>  That's pretty bad, considering that's what it was to begin with.

And Zero is stuck with 
the Masaki household. 

<Meis>  I wish I were him.

Our story begins.

<Invictus>  (Mortal Kombat)  It has begun.......
<Samus>  I'm warning you, stop saying that!

                      IN THE BEGINING

<JS>  That's harsh.  He misspelled the title.

                         Chapter 1


	 "It's been a month since X left", Zero thought. 

<Zero>--without punctuation to end the sentence.

"Not a 
word from him either, and I can't leave the house with my armor 
on or some inquisitive reporter might start asking questions, 
sigh ,at least I have Washu."

<JS>  That.....was ONE sentence.  That's astonishing.

 Washu enters the room. "Hello 
lover, anything new?" 

<Zero> (Turning green) I think I'm gonna be sick.......

Washu asks. "No not much." Zero answers. 
Washu's voice rises "I see you are still laying on the couch , 
Zero. Dear god  you've been mooping 

<Invictus>  What the hell does "mooping" mean?

around the house all month." 
"Well if I could leave the house without arousing suspicion I 
would get out." Zero starts to get up and leave. "Wait Zero, if 
that's the problem I have the solution. 

<All>  How conviiiiiiiiinient.

Come join me in the lab.
                Meanwhile upstairs in Tenchi's room Ryoko is 
trying to get  Tenchi's attention. "Get off me Ryoko!" Tenchi 
yells. "Ohh come on Tenchi I just want to show you something.

<Meis>  Yeah, her body.
 
Suddenly Ayeka busts into the room through the side wall. 

<X>  I didn't know she could do that, did you?  (All shake their heads)

" You 
space trash, how could you try to seduce my Lord Tenchi" 

<JS>  AGAIN without any ending punctuation.
<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  Ayeka begins the fight with a quick slap in 
the face, but how will Ryoko take it?

Ryoko 
gets up. "Your Lord Tenchi? I am much more suitable for Tenchi 
than you, you, you flat chested bimbo.

<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  And, after hesitating, Ryoko counters with a 
left hook to the chest!

After a brief moment a 
silence Ayeka launches a furious attack at Ryoko 

<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  This seems to have gotten Ayeka's goat, and 
she attacks with everything she's got!

knocking her 
through the outside wall. 

<JS> (Boxing announcer)  That's gotta hurt!
<Samus>  HEY!  That's MY gig!

Ryoko counterattacks with multiple 
energy blast. And of course Tenchi was in the middle. 

<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  Oh, there seems to be a scrawny person 
upsetting the fight!  This won't end well!

"Girls 
stop it!!!!" That was the last thing Tenchi said before both 
girls accidentally punched him knocking him out cold. 

<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  He's going, going, GONE!  He's outta the 
ring, out the window, and all the way to the North Pole!

In unison 
"TENCHI!!" Sasami and Mihoshi  run in. Sasami knells 

<JS>  Isn't a "knell" a type of hill? (All shrug)

down near 
Tenchi. "What happened?" Neither Ryoko or Ayeka answer. "Oh we 
can sort this out later. Mihoshi go get Yosho. Let's move him 
downstairs onto the couch."
	 Hours later Tenchi wakes up on the couch with a bandage on 
his head. "Uhhhhhhhhhhh! 

<Invictus>--ohhhhhhhhhhhh!

What happened?" A doctor walks toward 
Tenchi. 

<X>  AKA Washu.

"You have suffered a tremendous amount of bone damage in 
your skull. 

<Zero>  Wouldn't that give him brain damage?

But you have for some reason healed almost 
completely, that is , after I performed my Super  Cure All 
Procedure on you might I add is not cheap. 

<JS>  I think that run-on may have been longer than the other 
one.......nope, just a little bit shorter.

Here is my bill 
Mr.Masaki. 

<JS>  I think there's supposed to be a space in between "Mr." and 
"Masaki".

I'll expect my payment in 2 weeks or less. Good Day." 
Mr.Masaki looked at the bill and frowned. "Another bill and 
another debt. Not to mention the holes in Tenchi's walls. How 
are we going to pay for this? Sasami interrupts "With love?"  

<Samus>  She is NOT that stupid.

"I 
don't think so kiddo" Washu  enters the room from her lab. "The 
best we can do for now is clean up the mess and get the house 
work done. 

<Meis>  Couldn't Washu, you know, create some gold or something to pay 
for the damages?

Ryoko , Ayeka since you two trashed Tenchi's room you 
should be the ones to clean it up.  

<Invictus>  Yeah, that's logical.  Put the two reasons the house gets 
destroyed every day in the same room and expect them to get along for a 
few hours.  Great idea.

Sasami you make dinner and 
Mihoshi rake the leaves up outside."  Ryoko interrupts " And 
what will you be doing mom." 

<JS>--She asks without a question mark.

"I'll be keeping poor Tenchi 
company." "But mom you have a boyfriend." 

<Zero>  Don't remind me.

Washu, smiling "What 
can I say old habits die hard." 

<X>  Those were some good movies!

Ayeka enters the conversation 
"Speaking of Zero where is he? I thought for sure he would be on 
the couch." Ryoko jokes "What a freeloader he loafs around and 
avoids work." 

<Samus>  Now Ayeka says, "sounds like you".

"Sounds like you" quips Ayeka  

<Samus>  See?  They're so predictable.

"You ole hag you 
got us in this mess" 

<JS>  He can't even get "ol"  spelled right.

"OH YEAH?" "YEAH" "@#$%%^%$^&* YOU" 

<Zero>  That's the longest swear I have ever seen.

" SAME 
TO YOU" "Girls , girls this is how this started , SO SHUT UP. 

<Meis>  You tell'em, Washu!

Also if you must know Zero left hours ago to go to town. Now GET 
TO WORK!!" 

<Samus>  Washu has turned into a monstrous slave driver!

Everyone leaves to start their work. Only Washu and 
Tenchi are left in the room. 

<JS> (Laslo)  Say, we have a caller on line one.  Caller, what's your 
question?

"So Tenchi  do you feel up to a 
quick testing." 

<JS> (Laslo)  That's not a question.  Questions usually start with 
"when" and "why" and end with your voice going up like THIS!

Tenchi looks at Washu. "I feel as if I don't 
have a choice in the matter." 

<Meis>  Just like Washu to take advantage of a situation li--QUACK!  
QUACK QUACK!
<JS>  It seems Washu woke up already.

"Ah, Tenchi you know me all to 
well.
	   Many Hours later. 

<Invictus>--After raping Tenchi. (Turns into a water sprite)  QUACK 
QUACK!
<JS>  Yep, Washu is DEFINITELY awake now.
<Washu> (Walks in) *YAWN*  ah, that was a nice little nap.
<Zero>  But you fell unconcious because you were drunk.
<Washu> (Glares at Zero) I SAID, what a nice little nap!

Washu is sitting on the couch by 
herself. "It's Eleven o'clock where is he." Yosho enters the 
room. "Washu it's late everyone else is asleep. Go get some rest 
I will wait for him." "No I am fine. But thank you. A man in a 
suit walks into the room. 

<JS>  AGH!  It's a Leone!  Kill it!
<X>  I think he's been playing too much Grand Theft Auto III.

"Man those steps are a killer" Yosho 
gets up "May I ask who you are." 

<JS> (Person)  Yes, you may ask who I am, but next time, use a question 
mark!

Washu stands up "Oh that just 
Zero coming home late!" 

<Samus>  Washu _IS_ Shampoo.

"OH I'm soo sorry my queen please accept 
my soul as payment.

<Washu>  What the hell?
<Zero> *Sigh*  In this fic you and I are lovers.
<Washu>  OH GOD. (Throws up)
<Zero>  Okay, I get the point.  You don't have to barf all over me.

Yosho gives a puzzled looked "But the armor" 
"I the Great Washu added a program to Zero that makes him look 
human. 

<Washu>  I did that?

But if you Hit him it's pure bot,see" 

<JS>  STILL no ending punctuation in sight.
<X>  And why is "hit"  capitalized?
<Zero>  Maybe the author was taking a hit at the time.

Washu hit Zero in 
the arm and hits flesh. 

<Invictus and Meis>  QUACKQUACKQUACKQUACKQUACK!
<Washu>  Fine, but no more insulting me!
<Invictus>  Ahh, it's good to be tall again!

"Hey I didn't install a feeling sensor 
too" "My dear Washu I added on to my program so that I am 
human." "Noway 

<JS>  Christ, he can't even spell "no way" right.

If you were human I could cut you and you would 
bleed." 

<JS> (Monty)  Don't make me cut you!
<Meis>  Hey Zero, she's gonna cut you a new one.
<Washu> >__<*  I AM NOT!

Zero takes out a pen knife and makes a slice on his hand 
blood comes out. 

<Invictus>  EEK!  BLOOD! (Passes out)
<All>  O__O!
<JS>  Of all the people who are afraid of blood, Invictus, veteran of a 
thousand battles, is one of them?

"My Core processor has been replaced with a 
human brain. 

<All>  O__O;  Whose brain, exactly, did you use?
<JS>  Maybe it was the author's.
<Meis>  I guess Dr. Frankenstein did the procedure, right?

All my mechanical systems have been replaced by 
bone , muscle,and blood. 

<Zero>  =__=; and who could do that besides Washu?

Both Washu  and Yosho are stunned. 
Yosho is finally able to speak "What about your armor?" "It can 
be activated with a single thought by me! 

<All> How conviiiiiiiinient!

Then I'll be the Zero 
you know and  love. Washu starts to giggle 

<Washu>  I do NOT giggle!  I simply laugh in a very annoying nasal tone!

"So that means that 
you have all the human male qualities including testicular 
fortitude?" 

<All>  O__O!  OH NO!
<Wily>  Don't worry, it's not a lemon.
<Washu and Zero>  Whew!

Zero's eyes widened "Yes" Washu  grabs Zero's arm 
and heads toward the lab entrance. 

<Washu> (Eyes widen) Don't tell me--
<Zero> (Eyes bug out of his head) That we're going to--
<Both>  Have sex with each other?!  
<All>  Ewwwww.

"It's been nice talkin to you 
Yosho but I've got an experiment to start. 

<Meis>  Yeah, a love experiment!  *BLAMKLONG*  Ouch.
<Washu and Zero> (Blushing furiously) SHUT UP!

Yosho smiles " Say no 
more my dear." Zero and Washu enter the lab. If you put your ear 
to the lab door you could hear a female scream and a male 
moaning.

<Zero>  I am NOT hearing this.  I am NOT hearing this.
<Washu>  This is just a horrible nightmare, and I should wake up when I 
pinch myself. *Pinch* OUCH!

	  The next morning before any one else was up Zero and 
Washu were having coffee and watching the news on T.V. 

<JS>  It must have been the farm report, because Katsuhito gets up 
pretty damn early.
<Invictus> (Farm reporter #1)"In today's report, another cow was hit by 
a train. Those stupid cow pushers on the front didn't help at all."
<Meis> (Farm reporter #2)  And a pig just bit me.  Stupid black pig!  
Why don't you go to the North Pole! (Drop-kicks the pig northwards, and 
it somehow goes south)  Geez, that must've been Ryoga.
<X>  (To Invictus)  When did you wake up?  (Whispering)--wimp.
<Invictus>  I HEARD THAT!  You are SO dead!  Come here!
<X>  Aw crap.  I forgot he can hear stuff like that. (Runs away)
<JS>  Ah, the bonds of freindship grow ever stronger.
<Washu>  You're starting to talk like Kuno.
<JS>  ACK!  Kill me now!

Washu 
puts her cup down "You were pretty good last night." Zero puts 
his cup down  " I do aim to please" 

<Zero>  Yeah, but only when the aiming is for shooting!
<Meis>  In a way, that's what you were doing.
<All but Meis>  PERVERT!  DIEEEE!!!!! *BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMCHOFCHOF
CHOFCHOFKLONGKLONGPOWWHUMPBAMWHAMMOKABOOM*
<Meis> (Puddle of unrecognizable mush) I think I'll just be quiet now.
<All but Meis>  GOOD!

Washu takes another sip of 
coffee and jokes "For this being your first time you were right 
on target" 

<JS> (Looking at Zero and Washu) I think we might want to take a break 
here, before someone busts a blood vessel.
<Zero and Washu> (Veins popping out of their heads) Good idea!
--------All leave the theater--------
(Back in the lounge)
<JS>  I sure do love this pizza!  What do you call it again?
<Samus>  Cricket and mealworm pizza!
<JS> (Turning green, suddenly stops chewing)  Oh.  How.....interesting.  
Excuse me, I have to attend to some....business. (Rushes off)
<Samus>  Hmmm.  I wonder what that was all about.  I think this pizza is 
good! (Munches on pizza)  The crickets taste like chicken!
<X> (Turning green) Please, Samus, don't make us throw up.
<Meis> (Still mush, inside a fish bowl)  Can someone please get me out 
of here?!
<All>  NO!
<Meis>  Aw, why not?
<Washu>  Because, you'll just become a pain in the ass again.
<JS> (Returning, wiping his mouth off)  Shall we go back in?
<Washu and Zero>  Oh, all right.
--------All file back into theater, Samus is carrying Meis's fishbowl>
<Samus>  Aw, why do I have to carry the pervert?
<Washu>  It's the rule of Ranma 1/2.  The more you insult each other, 
the more you like each other.  That's why you have to carry him.
<Meis> (To Samus)  You really like me?!
<Samus>  NO! (Drops fishbowl) *KRASH*
<Washu>  Great, now he's going to turn back to normal.

Zero whispers to Washu "I didn't know you could 
scream so loud." 

<All but Washu>  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAQUACKQUACKQUACK!!!  QUACK?  QUAAAACK!
<Washu>  That'll teach you not to laugh at me.

Washu's face turns a deep red with 
embarrassment. "Say Washu didn't you at one time love Tenchi?" 
Washu smiling 

<Washu> (Author)  Me Shampoo!  Honest!

"I still do. But now its a older sister younger 
brother type of love." Zero smiles "So what kind of love am I?" 
Washu laughs "It should be pretty obvious after what you did 
last night.Now it was Zero's turn to be red with embarrassment.  
Zero gets up 

<Washu>  So, everything she said from "It", to "up" is her talking?  
That's pretty silly. (Notices all the water sprite MSTers turning green)  
Oh well, might as well change you back now.
<All but Washu>  Much better!

"I better get ready to go" Washu calmly asks "Where 
to?" Zero heads to the lab  "No where special just out" Washu 
gets up "When can I expect you back?" 

<Zero>  Half past NEVER.

Zero heads into the lab 
"Around the same time as last night." Washu cuts him off in the 
lab she comes in close for a kiss , Zero backs away. 

<Zero>  Yeah!  Go me!

"Washu I 
know what you did last night , I was there. I ain't kissing you 
until you brush your teeth and don't forget about the mouth 
wash!

<Zero> (Turning MANY shades of green) I didn't see THAT one coming.
<All> (Throw up)

               Meanwhile in Deep Space. 

<Meis>--Nine.
<JS>  And why is it capitalized?

"Master, we are close to 
the Earth's solar system, ETA (estimated time of arrival)

<X>  Only a retard wouldn't know what that meant.
<Meis>  HEY!  Dont call me a retard!
<All but Meis>  Figures.
 
unknown." "IT DOESN'T MATTER ZERO WILL GET HIS. 

<JS>--Just desserts!
<Zero>  Cake or ice cream?
<Samus>  LAME.

I WILL 
PERSONALLY SEE TO IT. ONCE HE IS OUT OF THE WAY EARTH IS OURS." 
"Sir what about those punks he befriended?" 

<Washu>  Oh, so now I'm a punk?
<X>  You DO look like one with that hair color.

"WE'LL DESTROY THEM 
ALL EXECPT THAT PINK HAIRED ONE. SHE IS SMART ENOUGH TO THWART 
US. WE WILL CAPTURE HER DRAIN HER OF HER INFORMATION THEN 
DESTROY HER." 

<JS>  Run-on, and I didn't know Sigma was capable of doing that.

"But what about the Galaxy Police?" "SHUT UP YOU 
ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS BUT I WILL HANDLE THEM TOO. 

<JS>  Run-on.
<Samus>  Stop doing that!

PREPARE THE 
TROOPS FOR BATTLE .
	 4 hours later in Sasami's Room. Sasami is tossing and 
turning in her sleep. 

<Meis> (Nightmare)  It is I.......JIMMY HOFFA!
<Invictus> (Sasami)  NOOOOOO!!!
<X>  Was that supposed to mean anything?
<Meis> No, not really.

She sees a shadow of a man destroying 
Tenchi. She sees all her friends laying on the ground not 
moving. 

<Samus>  So she goes over and starts poking them with a stick.
<JS>  That was dark.

As the dream goes on see sees the whole human race 
laying on top of one another. 

<X>  That's one big-ass pile of bodies.

She also sees a fleet of ships  
destroyed and the bodies of those deceased in the cold reached 
of space all dead. 

<JS>  I'm sure he meant "reaches", not "reached".

Sasami looks at the shadow again , it's 
starting to come in focus. It's Sigma , no the image changes to 
X , 

<X>  I would do no such thing!

no the view is clear, the shadow, the destroyer of Earth, 
Tenchi ,and that fleet ,it's Zero!! 

<Zero>  HEY!
<Meis>  Hello, Mr. Planet Killer.  GACK!
<Zero> (Holding Meis's neck)  You take that back!  Or I'll blast you 
into so much dust, they couldn't fill an ashtray with the remains!
<Meis>  I TAKE IT BACK!  I TAKE IT BACK!

Zero holds his blaster out 
smiles a wicked smile and fires on her. 

<All>  O__O!
<All but Zero> (Turn to Zero) \__/*  Would you really do that?
<Zero>  N-no!  Why would I want to hurt little Sasami?

Sasami wakes up in a 
cold sweat. Sasami in tears 

<JS>  First she's in a cold sweat, then she's in tears.  MAKE UP YOUR 
MIND!

goes to Tenchi's room. She wakes 
Tenchi up and tells him about the dream. Ryoko who is hiding in 
Tenchi's closet hears the story and Ayeka who is hiding under 
Tenchi's bed hears the story. 

<Washu>  I would expect that from Ryoko, but Ayeka?
<Meis>  I guess she wants to be as close to him as possible.
<Ayeka>  Ya damn right!  (Everyone looks around, but don't see anyone)
<JS> (Grinning evilly) I'm going to find that speaker and blow it to 
smithereens.  THEN I'm going to find Ayeka and get my revenge for all 
the times she's shocked me.

Coincidentally both come out at 
the same time and try to reassure Sasami. Ryoko starts "Sasami 
it was just a dream. Nightmare if you will." Tenchi interrupts " 
But still remember the dream she had about Kagato. That was a 
sign of things to come." 

<Meis and Invictus> (Start humming the X-Files tune)
<Meis>  Wait, that wouldn't make sense, because aliens are already 
living with him.

Ayeka ever so calmly states "Maybe we 
should tell Washu, just in case." They head down stairs to 
Washu's lab. 

<Meis> (Tenchi) Oh, I'm sorry Washu! I didn't know you and Zero were--
*BLAMBLAMBLAM!* PAIN!

Tenchi repeats the dream to Washu. Washu thinks for 
a while before speaking "Its just a dream. Zero would never hurt 
any of us. But as for Sigma........." Mihoshi burts into the 

<JS> (Sesame Street) Hello, I'm Burt!
<Washu> (Sesame Street) And I'm Ernie!

lab. "Miss Washu I just got an ergent 

<JS>  BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  He spelled "urgent" "ergent"!  AHAHAHAHAHA!

message from the galaxy 
police on my cube but I can' t get it to work. 

<JS>  I do believe that the CONTROL CUBE doesn't receive messages, that 
little wristband of hers does.

Washu sighs "Give 
it here" Washu tinkers for a bit then a video uplink of a 
soldier appears from the cube. "Mihoshi  we need help we were 
suddenly under attack by a huge force they are wiping us out 
please... 

<JS>  Number one, that was a really freakin' long run-on sentence, and 
number two, why would they ask Mihoshi for help?

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!." Washu tinkers some 
more "That was it. The transmission was cut off. But I can get a 
current view of the battle. 

<Washu>  Even I can't send a camera drone out there like that.

Hold on for a minute."Washu starts 
typing on her computer. A screen come up the whole fleet was 
wiped out. 

<JS> (British accent)  And here we see the run-on sentence in it's 
natural habitat.  Isn't it wonderful?  They seem to be growing in 
population lately.
<X> (Nature photographer)  Yes, it is truly amazing.

Dead bodies are everywhere. Sasami cries out "Thats 
what I saw in my dream." Mihoshi interupts 

<JS>  Again, number one, he's talking like Shampoo again, two, he forgot 
the apostraphe in "thats", and three, he misspelled "interrupts", and 
number four, there should be an exclamation point after someone cries 
out!  And Sasami shouldn't be watching that!  *Huf huf huf*
<X>  You shouldn't rant on like that, you'll kill yourself!

"But how did they 
know they were there. Those ships had a special cloaking device.

<X> (To Washu) Now, if the Galaxy Police ships had a cloaking device, 
why didn't you guys use it on the Yagami in Tenchi Universe to escape 
the Jurai military?
 
The only ones that knew about it was us..."   Ryoko adds " Us 
minus two. Yosho and Zero aren't here."Tenchi jumps in "Grampa, 
no way he was in the shrine all day yesterday and is out side 
raking right now. That leaves.." "Zero" 

<Zero>  Great, now I'm the bad guy.

Washu states. "He has 
been acting stange lately. Leaving the house in the morning and 
returning late. Not telling me where he's going. Very strange. 
Ok here's what we will do. Ack 

<JS>  OH NO!  The fic Washu is degenerating into Bill the cat!
<Meis and Invictus> (Bill the cat) ACK ACK ACK ACK ACK ACKPTH!

as if nothing has happened. I 
will try to speed up Ryo-Ohki's recovery. 

<JS>  Ryo-Ohki must've gotten hurt pretty badly to not be able to heal 
itself.

Ryoko you will spy on 
Zero and report every day. Alright lets get this experiment 
going."

<Washu>  Geez, everything is an expiriment to the fic me.

	Ryoko follows Zero for a month , the destruction of fleets 
contiue in space , and Zero keeps returning late.
In Town Ryoko is following Zero. Zero walks into a alley Ryoko 
follows but when she gets there he has vanished. 

<JS>  He pulled a Ryoko on Ryoko.

"I swear he 
went down here" "I did come down here Ryoko" Ryoko turns around 
to see Zero in full hunter armor blaster pointed at her. 

<Zero>  DAMMIT, IT'S CALLED THE Z-BUSTER!  Why doesn't anyone ever 
remember that?

"Now 
tell me why you have been following me for a month now!" Ryoko 
spills the beans about the whole operation. 

<Meis> (Fic Zero)  Ooh, Lima!

"I see and Washu put 
you up to this." Ryoko quickly answers "Yes"  Zero answers back 
"Well tell her I 'll be home early to answer some of those 
questions" Zero blast a blinding light at Ryoko. 

<JS>  This case of Shampooitis is getting pretty severe.

When the light 
is gone, so is Zero. 

<Invictus>  POOF!  Just like Batman.

Ryoko goes home and tells Washu what 
happened. Washu listens carefully and says "He won't be happy 
with me but I got to smooth it over with him."
	 Meanwhile in deep space. 

<Meis>--Nine.
<JS>  Stop doing that!  I hate Star Trek!

"Sir  we've wiped out over 100 
ships in the last month." "BAHH!! THREE LOUSY FLEETS. THE REAL 
FIRE WORKS START WHEN WE PASS MARS. I'LL DESTROY THEM ALL. 
MAINTAIN CURRENT SPEED."

<X>  Hmmmm.....
<Zero>  What are you pondering, X?
<X>  Oh, just that I don't remember the entire Galaxy Police force in 
OUR solar system.
<Zero>  Good point.
<JS>  And he used numbers instead of words.

	 1 hour later Zero returns to the Masaki residece. He heads 
straight for Washu's lab. Washu is sitting typing something on 
her  computer.  Zero quickly changes into his hunter armor and 
blasts the keyboard Washu is using. 

<Washu>  This author obviously doesn't know a THING about Tenchi Muyo.  
I mean, if you watch episode seven of the OAV, baby Taro puts his hands 
and head through the keyboard.  Also, I can make it appear and disappear 
any time I want.
<Invictus>  Are you quite done?
<Washu> ^__^  Yes!

Washu turns and faces Zero 
"Was that nessisary?" 

<JS>  This spelling is starting to hurt.

Zero is hot with rage " Idon't know you 
tell me. Was having Ryoko follow me nessisary?" 

<JS>  Ouch.

Washu frowns " 
Listen I only had the family's safety at heart. When Sasami had 
the dream.." Zero interrupts " A dream?! Yes, I do believe some 
dreams tell the future , but thats 

<JS>  Ouch.

why we have reality to make 
sure so dreams don't come true. 

<Zero>  I sure do talk a lot in this fic.
<Meis> (Mumbling)  Not just in the fic. (Z-Buster to his head)
<Zero>  You want to repeat that, Meis?
<Meis>  EEP!  NO!

Instead of spying on me you 
should have told me about the incidents. So did the spying pay 
off?"Washu looks at the blasted keyboard "No , everyday she 
would lose track of you.But that just added to the thought of 
you transmiting 

<JS>  OUCH.

information to the destroyers out there" Zero 
starts to laugh " Do you know what I was doing. I got a job 
working as a stockbroker's assistant. I had to arrive early each 
moring to get the good buys and stay late to assist the broker.

<JS>  Wow, what a surprise.  A walking calculator working with numbers.
<X>  Remember, he had his core processor taken out and a real brain put 
in by Dr. Frankenstein.
 
Why all this trouble for a job? 

<Meis>  Could it be.....MONEY?

The assistant position pays 
well. 

<Meis>  See?

And with the money I made I could help pay off some of the 
debt this family has." Washu has tears in her eyes " Oh Zero I 
didn't know." Zero turns his back to her " That's right you 
didn't know. And while I can't blame you for thinking the way 
you did I still wish you told me how you felt on the matter. And 
eve if I still hadn't told you, you could have asked Yosho about 
it. 

<X>  How the hell does he know that Katsuhito is Yosho?

Washu's face turns blank "Yosho?!!" Zero turns and faces her 
"Yosho knows because 1. He is up when I leave every morning, 2. 
He wacthes 

<JS>  OUCH.

where I go and 3. most importantly I give him the 
money to pay the bills. Zero change back into a suit and tie and 
exits the lab . Washu follows "Where are you going?" Zero turns 
"Back to work I'm on my lunch hour." Ayeka , Ryoko, Tenchi , 
Mihoshi and Sasami are on the couch  quietly waiting for Zero to 
leave. 

<X> (Ryoko, to Zero)  Go away!  SHOO!  SHOO!

After Zero leaves they all gather around Washu. Tenchi 
starts "So what did you find out?" Washu smiling " Well I found 
out we made complete boobs 

<Meis>  BOOBS!!!  *KLONG*
<Washu> (Retracting hammer) Like a colt, you are.

out of ourselves.  Aparently Zero has 
been working downtown to pay off the debt we're in. Not 
contacting the destroyer. Ryoko interupts " And you bought it oh 
man he's got you worked." 

<JS>  STILL not a comma to be seen for miles.

Washu starts again "If you don't 
believe me ask Yosho. Zero has been giving him the money to pay 
off the debt." Tenchi starts "Washu your right but I feel worse 
than a boob 

<Samus> (Pointing AC at Meis's head)  Say it and die.
<Meis>  I won't say it  I won't I won't I won't!

more like a backstabber."  Everone agrees except 
Ryoko who is still against Zero Sasami who has been quiet says " 
Maybe we could make it up to him by doing something nice." Washu 
agrees " Yes I know what we can do but we've got to hurry he 
gets off work at eleven. 

<JS>  This person obviously doesn't know about the miracle of the comma.

Ryoko interrupts again " Oh yeah that 
gives us only 9hours to work with. 

<JS> (Smacking forehead)  OH NO!  This person has Loreal syndrome!
<Zero>  What do you mean?
<JS>  LOOK!  He's using numbers instead of spelling them out.

Oh what will we do?" Washu  
with a big smile on her face "Ryoko sass me one more time and 
you'll be sorry!!!"
	 9 hours 

<JS>  OUCH!

later in deep space 

<Meis>--ni*BLAM!*  PAIN!
<Samus>  I told you to stop saying that, but NOOOO, you wouldn't listen.

" FIELD AGENT" "Yes sir" "GET 
YOUR TROOPS IN POSITION THE FINAL HOUR IS ALMOST HERE." 

<Invictus> (Covering ears)  He's very loud.
<X> (Also covering ears)  I'll have to agree with you on that one.

"Sir we 
have tracked Zero's last known location to a house in the hills. 
I already have a small platoon hiding around it" "GREAT. YOU MAY 
GET PROMOTED IF YOU DO YOUR JOB RIGHT. NUMBER 1, STATUS." "We 
are 7 days from Earth." "GOOD. FIELD AGENT TELL YOU TROOPS TO 
FIRE ON MY WORD.

	 Meanwhile in the Masaki house. Washu comes over to Zero. 

<Meis>  Wow, she's pretty talented.  
*BLAMBLAMKLONGSMACKWHUMPBAMPOWBANGCHOF*

"You seem distracted tonight is something wrong?" Zero looks up 
"No but something feels odd. I mean I'm glad you guy threw a 
party for me. 

<JS> (Doctor)  Okay, we need a stretcher, STAT!  I'll need a spellcheck, 
and ten CC's of English, and I need it yesterday, people!
<Washu> (Nurse)  Don't you think that's a bit severe, doctor?
<JS> (Doctor) ANYTHING to get this person spelling right!

I just need some air." Zero goes outside and takes 
in a breath of fresh air. "Something stinks. 

<Zero> (As fic Zero)  Oh wait, that's just my breath.

Wait I know that 
smell its from a warmed up plasma disruptor ......" 

<All>  HOW THE HELL DOES HE KNOW THAT?!!!
<JS>  AND it's a run-on sentence!

Zero runs 
into the house "Everbody move it!!!!" 

<X>  Hoof it to the broom closet!

"FIRE"  Outside hundres 

(JS falls on the floor, convulsing in pain)  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!
<Samus> (Kicks JS)  Oh come on, the spelling isn't THAT bad.

of  
plasma bursts come from bushes , trees and other objects. 

<Invictus>--Like a pebble, a cloud, Homer Simpson, the Batmobile, a 
statue of a my thumb, etcetera......

The 
blasts penetrate the house like it was made of paper.  The house 
is full of holes  big and small. 

<Invictus> (Tour guide)  Here we have the Swiss Cheese house, filled 
with holes big and small.

"Sir the target has been 
destroyed." 

This is the End of Chapter 1. But are our heroes dead , 

<All>  We hope so, then this craptacular fic would end!

if so 
I'm out of a job but if not  get ready for Chapter 2 

<Zero>  OH NO!  You mean there's ANOTHER chapter?!
<JS>  I'm afraid so.

Tenchi Muyo!  and related characters are copyrighted by Pioneer. 
Mega Man X and related character are copyrighted by Capcom. My 
name is W.Showers and email address is MShowmoney@aol.com

<All>  We're not even going to bother.

 In the previous chapter  Zero settled into the Masaki home and 
is now human, plus he got a job. A mysterious force is 
destroying ships in outer space. 

<All>  BOOM!

And in the end a group of 
troops  fire on the Masaki home with the gang inside. 

Chapter 2  

 The Masaki home is in ruins. The leader of the troops makes his 
report "Sir the house is no more. We detect no life signs in the 
house." 

<Washu>  Could it be because they're inside my sub-space laboratory?

"GOOD RETURN TO THE HIDEOUT AND WAIT FOR MY ARRIVAL." 
The troops head out. Inside the house all is still. When the 
smoke clears the door to Washu's lab opens. Zero steps out. 
"Geez it's gonna cost a fortune to clean this place up" 

<Washu> ^__^  Not with ME around!

The rest 
of the gang comes out. They look around. Tenchi finally breaks 
the silence " Any idea who would do this" 

<JS>  There must be a punctuation thief somewhere around here!  Be on 
your guard!

Zero steps up "They 
were using plasma disruptors. Only one person knew the right 
level of tolerance for that weapon. Sigma" 

<JS> Who didn't see that one coming? (Nobody raises their hand)

 Washu interrupts 
"While we were in the lab I got a ship on the short distance 
scanners. It's huge large 

<JS> (Sarcastically)  Gee, I wonder if it's a big ship.
<Meis>  That HAD to be a typo.

enough to take out those fleets in 
space just by running into them." Zero looks puzzled. "If this 
is Sigma where is X ? 

<X>  Knowing my luck, I'm probably his right-hand man.

But first things first we have to have a 
plan" "Washu smiles slyly " I've got one. Zero and I will 
teleport..." Ayeka interrupts " Teleport how?" Washu is  getting 
irritated "People stop interrupting. We will teleport using the 
teleport device in Zero's hunter gear..." 

<Zero>  Oh, so THAT'S how I teleport.

Zero interrupts " 
Sorry my teleporter only teleports people on earth and uses alot 
of energy. Why not use Mihoshi's ship.? 

<JS>  A period AND a question mark?

Washu has a vein pooping 

<All>  O__o;;;...............Ewwwwwww..............
<JS>  And here I thought veins were only good for running blood through 
your body.
<Washu>  You learn something new every day.

out in her head " Dammit stop interrupting. One Mishoshi 's 

<JS>  Ouch OUCH.
<Samus>  Oh _NO_.  You are NOT starting that up again.

ship 
is like a peanut compare to that ship. Two we would be detected. 
Three your teleporter can be reformatted for short space trips. 

<Zero>  Leave it to Washu to configure something to do ANYTHING you want 
it to.

Continuing with the plan once inside we'll plan 

<Washu>  I thought the planning was all finished.

my new 
antimatter charges all around the ship. If we find out it's 
Sigma's we denate. 

<X>  I have no idea what that last sentence meant, do you?  (All shrug)

If it's not his we disarm them. Not a bad 
plan. Considering I only had a few minute to think it up. Am I a 
genius or what?" No one argues with her seeing as if you 
disagree you might wake up a cat. 

<Washu>  I guess this person really DOESN'T watch the series.  I would 
turn them into a water sprite, not a cat.

Still Zero raises a concern   
"Even with that plan we should strengthen of base here. Just in 
case." Zero hand Tenchi a credit card. 

<JS> That severe case of Shampooitis just won't give up.

"Tenchi use this to buy 
supplies to repair and strengthen the house." Ryoko  swoons over 
Tenchi. Ryoko wispper 
in Tenchi's ear 

<JS>  He can't even spell "whisper".  And everyone, be careful.  We 
don't want you guys catching Shampooitis too.
<All but JS>  What you mean?
<JS>  AAAAAAAAAAAUGH! (Faints)
<X>  Geez, he was really convinced, wasn't he?

" Ya know you don't have 
to spend all of it on supplies. Some new rings or maybe a trip 
for two." 

<Samus>  Qand for once, someone's in character.

Ayeka over hears and start arguing.  Tenchi for once 
makes them take it outside showing that the house can't take 
another beating. 

<Zero>  Didn't it collapse to the ground?
<Washu>  I don't think so.

Zero heads for the lab but Washu stops him. 
"Since when do you have a credit card ?" Zero looking nervous 
"Ahh, I don't give all my money to Yosho. And it's better than 
caring cash." 

<Zero>  Yeah, I guess he doesn't care about cash if he gives most of it 
to Katsuhito.

Washu smiles "Don't you mean OUR money?" Zero's 
nervousness is growing " Yeah didn't I say that?" Zero thinks 
"Got to change the subject before I never hear the end of this.( 
Speaking out loud now) 

<All>  Duhhhhh.........
<X>  Say, JS, when did you wake up?
<JS>  I dunno.  I guess it's just so I can insert my commentary on this 
author's bad spelling.

So when's the ship get to Earth's 
atmosphere?" Washu changes her tone to serious "In a 3 to 4 
days. 

<JS>  He used numbers again!  This person is ripe with viruses!  First 
Shampooitis, then Loreal's syndrome, what next?  Tank Cop fever?
<X>  What, exactly, is "A three to four days"?

But I have created a magnetic storm to slow them down. 
Excuse me I have to make the charges." She heads into the lab. 
Zero thinking again " Whoa dodged a bullet there. But I better 
get ready for Sigma gotta get pumped." 

<All> (Shoe commercial)  PUMP IT UP!
<JS>  That last sentence was a run-on.
<Samus>  STOP IT!!!

Washu thinking "He thinks 
he dodged a bullet eh. We'll see once this jobs done."

<Zero>  O__o;  Washu, you can read minds?!
<Washu>  I have no idea what this author is talking about!

	In space. "THIS DARN MAGNETIC STORM CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. 
NUMBER 1 HOW MANY DAYS DOES THIS PUT US BACK?" "Two days sir." 
"AS SOON AS COMMUNICATION IS BACK UP GET ME THE FIELD AGENT. I 
HAVE A FEELING THIS STORM WAS CREATED BY A SHORT PINK HAIRED 
FRIEND OF OURS." 

<JS>  I THINK I'M GOING DEAF!
<X>  WHAAAAT?! 
<JS>  I SAID, I THINK I'M GOING DEAF!
<X>  WHAAAAT?!
<JS>  OH, NEVER MIND!

"Yes sir." 
                3 days later in the Masaki home. Tenchi and the 
girls are outside working on the house while Washu reformates 
Zero's teleporter. 

<Washu> (TV commercial)  Yes, it's "Reformate", the newest version of, 
"Reformat"!

Tenchi stops and looks at the house. " Wow 
the house looks as good as new and stronger since Zero made us 
reinforce the house with steel." 

<Invictus>  Well, I think I know a bit about plasma weaponry, seeing as 
how I have one!  And does THIS look like steel will stand up to it? 
(Fires his Plasma Blaster at a pile of metal, the metal melts into a 
puddle of molten goo)  HA!
<Washu>  YOU FOOL!  I was gathering that metal for an escape pod!
<Invictus>  Oopsie.

Ayeka who is working beside him 
joins in "Yes and with all of us working we'll be done in 
notime" 

<JS>  Noway, notime, this person doesn't use the space bar to it's 
fullest potential!

"Easy for you to say" grunts Ryoko "I have to set up the 
house wide force field Washu  made.Ryoko sets a spike into the 
ground. She flips the switch on it. The spike shoots out energy.
It fries Ryoko. Mihoshi checks on her. 

<Invictus>  She did this, period.  Then she did that, period.  she did 
this, period.  then, finally, she did those things, period.  Period 
period period!

"Didn't Washu say wait 
till all the spikes were down before turning it on?" 

<X>  Now how could Mihoshi remember something like that?

A fried  
Ryoko 

<JS>  Crispy fried PUNK!
<Samus>  I think we should keep him away from the Twisted Metal games, 
too.

replies "Silly me" They continue to work knowing that they 
will be in one of the greatest battle any of them has ever been 
in. Meanwhile inside the house Sasami gloomily cleans the 
house.She is thinking about her injured friend Ryo-Ohki. 

<Washu>  More like pet.  Well, she CAN think for herself, so I guess 
friend is acceptable.

" Oh 
Ryo-Ohki that mean ole Sigma hurt you badly. I'm going to get 
even don't you worry. I'll go with Washu and Zero and get him 
good." 

<JS>  Great, now Sasami's a dumb-as-a-brick homocidal maniac.

Washu overhearing her thoughts excuses herself from 
reformatting  grabs something out a tank and goes upstairs to 
Sasami. 

<Washu>  CHRIST!  It seems that I have the ears of a bat in this fic!

"Sasami I overheard your thoughts and well maybe this 
will help" She hands her Ryo-Ohki. "Oh thank you Washu you saved 
her." Washu replies " Yes but she is still very weak. You have 
to take good care of her or she'll die." 

<Meis>  No offense to Sasami, but I wouldn't trust her to take care of a 
critical patient.
<Samus>  Wow, Meis, that's the first intelligent sentence I've ever 
heard you say!
<Meis>  Huh?  You shot who in the what now?
<Samus>  Okay, that kinda cancels that smart thought out.

Sasami smiles " Oh I 
will I will" 

<JS> (Sasami, evil voice)  You are at MY mercy!  MWAHAHAHAHA!!!

Washu heads back to her lab. She continues to 
reformat Zero's teleporter.  "I just did my good deed for the 
day" Zero smiles "Good for you. Say can you hurry up I got to go 
to work to ask for a few days off." 

<Invictus> Geez, it could be the end of the world as we know it, and he 
wants to go ask for a few days off?

Washu with a pair of tools 
"Just be still this is delicate work." 
            Meanwhile in space. "FIELD AGENT REPORT." "We have 
destroyed the target. Zero wall seen in the house before it's 
destruction." "DID YOU RECOVER THE BODIES?" "Ah no sir we 
assumed they were vaporized." "YOU MORON THE PLASMA DISRUPTOR 
ISN'T CAPABLE OF VAPORIZATION. 

<Invictus>  On the contrary!  Plasma weapons are fully capable of 
vaporisation! (Takes a pot-shot at Meis, but he dodges.  The plasma hits 
a seat and vaporises it)  See?
<Meis>  Watch where you're aiming that thing, bub.

GET BACK THERE  AND GET THE 
BODIES." "Shall I take a small force?" "IF YOU DID YOU JOB YOU 
WON'T NEED ONE."

<JS> (Field agent) Well YOU I YOU think YOU that YOU I YOU should YOU 
take YOU a YOU small YOU force YOU!

             Later that same day at the Masaki home. It's dinner 
time. The whole family is at the table. No one is speaking just 
eating. Finally Zero breaks the silence "You guys did a good job 
on the house you can't even tell it got shot up." 

<Zero> (Tenchi)  Gee, thanks.

Tenchi thanks 
him for the compliment. Washu speaks up "Ryoko how's the force 
field going?" Ryoko stops eating " All the spikes are down" 
Washu  starts eating again and all is silent. Zero has had 
enough  and stands up " OK what is the problem!!! 

<JS>  It's time for my trademark line: ?????????????????????????? <== 
I've got a million of 'em, just ask!

What is with 
this silence?" Tenchi calmly explains " We feel as if we aren't 
together on this mission." Zero fires back 

<All>  BLAM BLAM BLAM!

"You guys can't come 
because only I can take out Sigma and only Washu can activate 
and set the charges. 

<JS> The author seems to have Run-on disorder, too.

Plus someone has to stay and make sure 
Sasami is ok" 

<Washu>  Well, considering she's a goddess, I think she'll be just fine.

Tenchi raises his voice "We don't even know if it 
is Sigma and Sasami can take care of herself." 

<Washu>  See?

Zero raises his 
voice " Oh is that true. What if all of us except Sasami left 
and while we were gone Sigma sends his troops and captures her 
then what." Tenchi starts yelling "What's the force field for 
huh decoration. 

<JS>  Wow. That was pretty amazing.  Tenchi yelled a question, yet it 
sounded nothing like yelling or a question.

And what makes you such a expert on Sigma. So 
you chased him for years but that's all you did, chase!!!"

<JS>  Battle and Chase!
<All but JS>  O__o; Huh?
<JS>  It's a Megaman racing game.
 
Everyone is quiet mostly surprised at Tenchi's words. Zero 
changes to hunter gear and point his blaster at Tenchi. 

<Meis>  (Zero, as cook)  Okay, one order of fried Tenchi brains, coming 
right up!

"You 
know for someone as spineless as you you got alot of balls 
getting in my face. 

<Zero>  YEAH!  GO ME!  Kick his ASS!

You want to know why I know Sigma so well 
because I used to be an X hunter like Sigma." 

<All but Zero and X>  Really?
<Zero> >__<*  Yes, really.  What, you think Wily would make me a good 
guy?

Everyone gasps 
even Tenchi. " Boy I've done things that makes Ryoko's acts seem 
like charity work. 

<Washu>  And that's saying something!

I was programmed to kill all humanoid life 
forms and for years I was good at it. 

<Zero>  Don't remind me.

Until Dr.Cain fixed me. 

<JS>  Yeah, where did he go after X three?  He just kinda....faded away, 
y'know?
<X>  I'm not sure, either.  I think he went and helped Sigma in X five.

I chase Sigma to repay a debt to all the people I hurt. 

<Meis>  PAIN!

I know 
Sigma will come after Sasami as soon as his men come by and see 
the house intact.Why Sasami because he will have a hostage that 
is powerless to stop him. 

<JS>  Oh sure, she's a goddess, but apparently it doesn't matter in this 
story.

Then we bend to his will because he 
has one of our own. We don't he kills her. 

<All>  O__o;  Huh? 
<JS>  Did you understand that last sentence at all?
<X>  Nope.

It's as simple as 
that. How do I know , because that's what I would have done. 
Excuse me."Zero heads to the lab to blow off steam. Tenchi is 
angry too "Well screw you Zero you don't know everything. He 
storms off to his room. Everyone is shocked. Washu gets up 

<Invictus>  It's kind of strange that Tenchi would say all that, not to 
mention "screw you".

"I'll 
talk to Zero and calm him down. Yosho please calm Tenchi down. 

<Washu>  I ALWAYS call him Katsuhito, not Yosho.

We don't need this a few days before the big drop. Washu goes 
into the lab. In the lab Zero is punching a punching bag in the 
lab. 

<Samus>  What a barbarian.  Boxing!  HMPH!
<Zero> (Whispering to JS)  What's with her?
<JS> (Whispering to Zero)  Her last boyfriend was the intergalactic 
boxing champ.  He cheated on her.
<Zero>  Ohhhhhh.

Washu come next to him "Zero you were very hard on Tenchi. 

<Meis>  Zero, I didn't know you were gay!
<Zero>  SHUT UP AND DIEEEE!!!!  *BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM
BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM!*
<Holey Meis>  Ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch.

Instead of yelling you should have tried to see his point of 
view." Zero turns to her " His point of view?  The boy has lived 
a sheltered life with a bunch of women. The most he worries 
about are grades and not hurting someones feelings. If I could 
rid the world of Sigma and all of his kind I would do anything 
even suicide." 

<Zero>  And, knowing where this story is going, that's probably what I'm 
going to do.

Washu kisses him on the cheek "Now hear what I 
have to say. If you could shelter Tenchi from living a life you 
went through would you? Yes you would because you defend the 
innocent. But you never had a childhood so you don't know what 
he's going through. So don't slander him try to learn from him 
and give him advice when he needs it. 

<All>  Him him him!
<JS>  AND it's a run-on!

That is what a friend 
does." Zero kisses Washu deeply 

<Zero and Washu>  BLECH.

" Will you marry me?" Washu 
steps back "Where did that come from?" Zero answers " Well I 'd 
been thinking of a way to ask you and it just slipped out. So 
will you?" Washu thinks deeply then answers "For you Zero 
anything." 

<All>  Awwwww.
<Zero and Washu>  Wait, what am I thinking?

They kiss passionately.  

<Samus>  Smoochy smoochy!

Meanwhile in Tenchi's room 
Yosho tries to calms Tenchi down. "Grampa,  he thinks he knows 
everything. He's staying in our house he could at least show 
some respect." 

<Zero> (Tenchi, as Rodney Dangerfield)  I don't get no respect!  None at 
all!

Yosho calmly responds "Respect? The man got a job 
that works him longer than most men to pay off our debt, none of 
of other guest have a steady job, I think he knows respect. 

<JS>  And here we have the world's longest sentence!

You 
could learn alot of things from him. Take advantage of his 
experience, he won't be here forever" 

<Invictus>  Gee,  wonder if the author is trying to tell us something.

Tenchi who is calm "Your 
right I was dumb to make a scene like that" 

<X>  He used the wrong "you're".
<JS>  HEY!  That's MY job!

Yosho tells Tenchi 
to get rest and apologize in the morning. Outside the field 
agent watches the house. "I must report this."
         Later that night in space "FIELD AGENT REPORT." 

<JS>  That's what, the fifth time it's said that?

"Sir 
the targets are still alive..." " WHAT SO THEY SURVIVED. 

<All>  Huh?
<JS>  That last sentence didn't make a lick of sense.

YOU 
HAVE FAILED ME  AGENT." " No sir I heard their plan to 
infiltrate the ship. They plan to send Zero and the pink haired 
one up as so as the ship is in teleporter range. 

<Washu>  "The pink haired one"?  Dammit, I'm the greatest scientific 
genius in the universe!

The others 
would stay on Earth." "IS THAT SO. FIELD AGENT? YOU JUST SAVED 
YOURSELF FROM DESTRUCTION. HOW MANY DAYS UNTIL WE ARE IN THEIR 
RANGE?" "You will be in range tomorrow" "THAT SOON HUH WELL 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A NICE SURPRISE WAITING FOR THEM!!!!!!!!"

<Meis>  Wow, that's a lot of exclamation points.
<JS>  I think the comma has become extinct in this person's world.
 
Meanwhile in the Masaki home everyone is in bed resting up for 
tomorrow. Tenchi is sleeping in his bed , Ryoko is sleeping on 
the floor next to him. Ayeka and Sasami are in their rooms and  
Mihoshi strangely enough is  checking all her weapons.  

<JS>  To quote Peter Suzuki on the weapon, "You know, that giant gun she 
uses from time to time,
that isn't supposed to be loaded, yet somehow manages to fire and 
destroy stuff, anyway".

Downstairs in the lab Zero and his wife to be, Washu are in bed 
but Zero is not sleeping. He holds her very tight by her waist. 
His eyes are wide open.He carresses her neck with soft 
kisses.She makes a low happy wine in her sleep.

<Meis>  Wow, Washu!  You can make wine when you're sleeping?  Now THAT 
is a talent!

He slowly loosens 
his grip on her. He decides to get up and get some air. On the 
outside step he sees Yosho. He sits beside him. Yosho is staring 
at the sky "Zero what keeps you up tonight?" Zero turns to see 
the sky "It's this mission. I have so many responsibilities. 
Gotta be sure this is Sigma. Hope nothing happens here while we 
are gone. And watch over Washu in that ship." 

<Washu>  Yeah, you better not let me die!

Yoshu looks at 
Zero "Ah you miss the solitude of the missions of past. You just 
worried about yourself and geting that crook. 

<JS>  Yet another sentence that doesn't make any sense.

But now it's 
complicated." Zero in shock 

<JS>  I don't think he's gonna make it.  The Shampooitis is too severe 
to cure.
<All but JS> GASP!

"Yeah you read me like a book. See I 
have no problem  detonating those charges with me in the ship 
but now I have someone else there with me and it's not my choice 
anymore." Yosho stands up "I assume that Miss Washu will not 
only be you partner for this mission but for the rest of your 
life. Now you have to make it you likelong mission to see that 
she never gets hurt. 

<X>  How do you make something "likelong"?

That is your true mission. Think about it" 
Yosho walks back in the house."What does that mean?" Zero sits 
for a little longer before going in. He returns to the lab and 
tinkers some with his teleporter then looks at bed.

<JS>  He's a lost cause.

He looks at 
Washu in her adult form 

<Meis>  HUBBA HUBBA!  *KLONG!  KLONGKLONGKLONGKLONGKLONG!*
<Washu>  I may look good, but I would never go near YOU.

"I won't let him get to you.I love you 
now and forever" He kisses her cheek and takes the charges with 
him as he exits the lab. 

<JS>  That's a run-on, and I thought it said only Washu knows how to 
activate the charges.

He sits on the couch in his hunter 
armor. "At 6 o'clock the ship will be in range and I'll get you 
Sigma."
                       6'oclock the next morning in space. "We 
are in their range sir." "GOOD YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO." In the 
Masaki home. Zero uses the teleporter and gets on the ship. 15 
minutes later 

<JS>  Yes, this case of Loreal's syndrome is getting very bad, too.

Washu wakes up to find her charges  and Zero gone. 
"No he couldn't have. Computer scan for Zero" "ZERO IS NO LONGER 
ON EARTH" Washu goes up stairs and wakes everyone up and brings 
them downstairs. 

<JS>  He seems to be showing signs of the Run-On flu, also.  Hmmm, this 
person is a walking virus.

" Zero has already left for the ship and there 
is nothing we can do about it. Everyone the fated hour is here. 
Get the force field up and get ready for battle." 

<JS>  No, you don't say it like that, you say, "Ryoko, activate the 
force field.  Everyone, PREPARE FOR BATTLE!!!"

Everyone is 
groggy and moves slowly. Washu fixes that problem with a quick 
jolt of electricity to the gang. Now they start moving with 
speed. 

<Washu>  Oh, so now we're druggies.

Meanwhile on the ship Zero takes out the charges. he 
places one on the wall and activates it. "Scaners indicate that 
the control room is due north. Sigma here I come." 

<Samus>  It's a "scaner", the less accurate version of a "scanner".

He runs down 
the corridor planting charges as he runs. He thinks this is 
suspiciously unguarded for a warship. He keeps moving . A light 
at the end of this long  corridor has to be the control room. 

<All>  DON'T GO INTO THE LIGHT!!

He 
makes it to the control room. The door shut behind him. "I'VE 
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ZERO" Zero looks in the shadows of the room 
and sees Sigma! 

<X>  What a surprise.

"So it is you you piece of ..." 

<Washu>--WORK.

"NO NEED FOR 
TRASH TALKING. WE BOTH KNOW WHY YOU ARE HERE, TO STOP ME FROM 
DESTROYING THE HUMAN RACE. SO HAVE AT ME!!!!!!" Zero takes a 
shot at Sigma with his blaster. Sigma dodges and returns fire. 

<All> (Monotone)  Wow, how amazing.

The blast hits Zero square in the chest launching him into a 
wall. Sigma walks toward Zero. "GOTTEN SLOW HAVE WE?" Zero 
smiles "Gotten stupid have we?" Zero throws his  sword at Sigma. 

<Zero>  I would NEVER throw my saber!  I would launch myself at him, 
swinging it furiously!

The sword pierces through Sigma's armor and goes right into his 
gut. 

<X>  Geez, this Sigma must've worked REALLY hard to make a body that had 
a gut.

Zero gets up and takes his sword out of Sigma. He raises it 
above his head "Finally it's time to die Sigma" As he brings the 
sword down Zero is shot from behind. The shot carries Zero 
through a wall. "What the hell was that!" Sigma gets up "IT WAS 
MY COMMANDING OFFICER. ZERO PLEASE MEET MY NUMBER 1, NEO 
X!!!!!!!!!" 

<X> Grumble grumble, stupid author, grumble grumble.....
<JS>  I wonder where he got the name NEO.  Could it be from X one, NEO 
Sigma?  Hrm?

Zero gets up only to see X in black armor. 

<Zero> (Looks at X)  Y'know, that armor looks a lot like the Ultimate 
Armor that you're wearing right now.

"X what 
the hell are you doing. We have to destroy him." X walks foward 
" Sorry brother but Sigma is much more fun to be with than you." 

<JS>  Ummm, I think this guy is confusing the X series with the regular 
series.  X and Zero aren't brothers, Megaman and Protoman are.

X shoots Zero again . " X ,I will not fight you." 

<Zero>  This guy obviously hasn't played Megaman X five, or else he 
would know that we WOULD fight each other.

X smiling 
"Then you will die" X continues to fire on a damaged Zero. 

<X>  I would NEVER do that!

Sigma 
who is badly damaged walks to the control panrl and has a 
mechanical hand pick Zero up.Zero is half awake and half 
unconscious. 

<JS>  Jesus, that was a long sentence!

"DON'T WORRY ZERO YOUR FRIENDS WILL JOIN YOU SOON. 
I SENT MY FORCES DOWN THERE TO DESTROY YOUR FRIENDS. IT WILL BE 
ALL OVER SOON." Zero laughs in his face. "Don't expect your 
force comming back. Those kids are as tough as nails. 

<Washu>  HEY!  Who are you calling a kid?!

Your such 
a fool. Haahahahahahahahah!!!!" 

<Zero>  I think he's laughing because he purposely used the wrong 
"you're".

X slaps Zero in the face. "TAKE 
HIM TO THE TORTURE ROOM HOOK HIM UP TO THE NERO NET AND START AT 
50 AMPS ."

<JS>  One, that sentence could have been THREE sentences.  Two, why 
wouldn't they just disassemble him, and three, what the hell is a 
"nero"?

	 Back on Earth. Washu is in her lab getting ready. Ryoko , 
Tenchi and Ayeka are outside ready for battle. Mihoshi is 
watching over Sasami. Suddenly Washu yells "Incoming enemy from 
all sides. This is not a drill. Go out and kick some 

<JS>  Heinie!
<X>  Tin cans!
<Zero>  ASS!
<Washu>  Primitive life-forms!
<Samus>  Balls!  (All the guys cross their legs)

butt. 

<All>  Oh.

Washu 
lets the force field down and Tenchi Ryoko and Ayeka move out in 
front of the force field. 

<JS>  And the redundancies appear.

Washu puts it back up. Tenchi  yells " 
I'll be damned Zero was right." 

<JS>  Apparently, exclamation points are extinct here, too.

Ayeka yells "This is no time to 
be sorry. I'll take the ones on the left Tenchi you take the 
center and Ryoko you take the right. Ok here they come"
 A large group of flying huminoid machines. 

<JS>  A large group of fling humanoid machina _WHAT_?
<Zero>  Oh, did you learn that word from Tidus?
<JS>  Yeah, I like the word "machina" better than "machine".

Armed with plasma 
rifles they fire on the house only to have it stoped 

<JS>  I hope he meant "stopped".

by a force 
field. Ryoko moves first creating an enrgy blade and slashing  
through the machines on her side 1 by 1. 

<X>  Yeah, I see how this person is like Loreal.

Tenchi uses his sword 
and starts swinging. 

<Samus>  Be logical here.  Why would a bunch of flyers get close enough 
to a non-flyer so that it could attack them?  It's just like in video 
games!
<JS>  Well, they ARE from a video game, you know.

Ayeka gathers a mass of energy and blasts 
away some of the machines on her side. After many minutes of 
fighting all the machines are destroyed. 

<JS>  Wow, a whole "many minutes".
<Invictus>  At least he didn't droll on and on about the battle, thereby 
shortening our torture.

Tenchi sits down " I 
never fought so many machines in my life" 

<Zero>  I didn't know he had fought ANY machines in his life!
<JS>  Well, there are Yakage's guardians, but they are more biological 
than mechanical.

Ryoko plumps down 
right next to him "Ditto" 

<JS>  AAAAAGH!  It's a Pokemon!  KILL IT!

Washu speaks to them telepathically " 
It's not over yet there are more on the way even larger than 
before."Tenchi stands up "We can't hold them off forever." Washu 
agrees " Ryoko I have pin pointed the location of their origin 
sector 5b. 

<JS>  Y'know, I'm running out of jokes for the numbers, so I think I'll 
stop.
<All but JS>  GOOD!

You go there and shut them down from there." Ryoko 
argues " But who will cover the right?" Washu calmly explains " 
Don't worry about it I prepared for an attack on the house when 
I first moved in. Behold." Washu presses a button on her key 
board. Out of the roof and other normal places around the house 
gun turrents appear. 

<Washu> (Tenchi)  Wow, I don't think I'll feel safe going to the 
bathroom in that one again.

"I have now activated our security system. 
The turrents will target and fire on anything that I have not 
regestered as allies. 

<JS> *SHEEN FOOM* (Washu)  Oops, I forgot to put Noboyuki in the 
database.  Silly me!

So go now Ryoko and hurry." She teleports 
off. The turrents lock on to the incoming machines and start to 
fire. Tenchi yells " Here we go again."
                 In the control room of Sigma's ship. "HOW GOES 
THE ATTACK FIELD AGENT?" " Horrible sir , they have taken out 
75% 

<JS>  ARGH!  You don't say "75%", you say, "seventy-five percent"!

of the troops and 1 of them is hoovering  

<Samus>  Oh, so now Ryoko is a vacuum cleaner?

above the 
facility. What she's building energy? Stop her 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!" 

<Meis> "Stop her AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"?  I didn't understand that, but O-
kay!

"COMPUTER RESTABLISH CONTACT"  
"unable to comply  signal destroyed." " I'LL HANDLE THOSE 
INFIDELS MY SELF."  

<JS>  I'm pretty sure there's no space between "my" and "self".

In the torture room Zero is being tortured 
by X. "X  I could destroy you right now. I have antimatter 
charges planted.

<Invictus> (Zero)--In my pants!
<Meis> (X)  Aw, you really smell, you know that?!

Ahhhhh!" X punches him in a place where his 
armor was cracked. " 

<Samus> (Boxing announcer)  Ohhh, sucker punch!

You could but you would die too , and with 
Sigma leaving it would be pointless."  Zero is starting to give 
in to the shock treatment. 

<All>   ZAP!

"Maybe.. so..but..with his ..force .. 
destroyed and no ship.. he can't run. 
Goodbye...Brother.....Washu." 

<Zero>  Must....keep........talking 
like.....William........................................................
...........Shatner......

Zero detonates the charges. 

<All>  KABOOM!

The 
explosion takes out the control room and the power chamber. The 
explosion also rocks Zero out of his torture contrapment and 
knocks X to the floor. Sigma in the telportation room feels the 
shock. "SO HE DETNATED THE CHARGES COMPUTER GET ME OUT OF HERE." 

(all try to understand the last sentence)  Huh?

"what about neo x?" 

<X>  Oh, so now my name's not important enough to capitalize?

"IS HE STILL UNDER MY CONTROL?" "no the 
blast knocked the s-chip out" 

<X. (Pulls something out of the back of his helmet)  Hey, here's my S-
chip!  It helps me heal!  It's not a control chip!

"THEN IT'S LIKE KILLING TWO BIRDS 
WITH 1 STONE. TELEPORT ME TO THE HOUSE OF TENCHI NOW" Sigma is 
teleported to the Masaki house. Tenchi , Ayeka , Ryoko and Washu 
are standing waiting for him. 

<JS>  Time to die!

Tenchi draws his sword " So you're 
Sigma ,well its all over . You don't have any troops to back you 
up." Sigma laughs " I DON'T NEED TROOPS TO FINISH YOU OFF. I 
KILLED ZERO AND X MY GREATEST COMPITITON AND YOU ARE NEXT" Washu 
flares with anger . "You killed him !!! 

<Washu>  How can I ever repay you?!
<Zero>  HEY!

" She uses her keyboard 
to change her into fighting gear 

<Meis>  So, she turns herself into a sword and shield?

and get even. She attacks Sigma 
using  various  fighting styles. 

<JS> (Washu)  HA!  I have been training in the ways of Anything-Goes 
Martial Arts!

Everyone is amased 

<Washu>  I think he meant "amazed".

to see Washu 
fight. Sigma blocks and counter attacks. Back in the ship X 
picks himself off the floor and looks for Zero. He finds him on 
the floor motionless "Zero!!!!! Wake up we gotta get out of 
here." X turns Zero on his back. "Say Zero you're bleeding how 
is that possible?" 

<Samus> (Zero) Duh, I don't know.....

Zero painfully explains "So I finally got 
through to you. If you must know while on Earth I got an upgrade 
that made me human. If we get out of here alive I'll make sure 
you get it too" 

<Zero>  I must not have been in a lot of pain to say all that.

X picks Zero up  and puts Zero's arm around his 
neck. 

<Invictus>--And then Zero tightens his arm, breaking X's neck.

"Come on Zero the teleporter room is just down the hall." 
They make it to the corridor to find it on fire and falling 
apart. Zero is trying to speak "X.... just ...leave ..me...I'm 
slowing you down."   

<X> (Zero)  Yes....I've been....infected........with the.......William 
Shatner..........virus..........

X pays no mind to him and continues to 
carry Zero down the corridor. "Computer is the teleport room 
still operational" "YES" "How long till this hunk of junk blows 
up completly?" "20 minutes" "Then we better hurry." 

<JS>  That must be a damn big ship if they have to hurry with twenty 
minutes to spare.

               Back on Earth. Sigma and Washu are still battling 
it out. Nether one has landed a blow. 

<JS>  Okay, this spelling is really getting on my nerves.

Washu is is getting 
pumped. " Ok time for my Washu Surprise." She comes toward Sigma 
takes a hop back and an energy ball surounds her right foot. She 
kicks him with it. Sigma is slamed through a tree. 

<Samus>  Whatever the hell "slamed" means.

She kicks at 
him again and the energy ball comes off and slams into Sigma. 
"Had ..huff. enough...huff .cromedome" 

<JS>  HEY!  I take offense to that!

Sigma get up and wipes 
the dirt off him. "If that's the best you have you should give 
up now." Ryoko screams " Thats it I've had it. Everybody all at 
once." The group attacks  Sigma all at once. Sigma's speed is 
too much for them and all of their attacks miss. 

<X>  Sigma was NEVER as powerful as this.

Sigma powers up 
his blaster and blasts Ryoko. She flies through the air and 
comes down on the roof of the house. She then rolls off and 
falls to the ground. Tenchi comes at him with sword above his 
head. With super quickness 

<All>  BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
<JS>  Hoo, that was funny.  "Super quickness"?  It's supposed to be 
"super speed", or something like that.

Sigma loges 

<JS>  I have NO idea what that means.

his fist into Tenchi's 
stomache. 

<JS>  And I'm pretty sure there's no E in "stomach".

Tenchi drops his sword and falls to the ground. Ayeka 
uses her power logs 

<All> P-P-Power....Logs?........BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
<JS>  HAHA, Ohhh.  They're called mini-guardians, buddy.

to suround Sigma. They start shocking him. 

<All>  ZAP!

Sigma releases a great amount of energy around his body 
destroying the logs. 

<X>  Okay, this is NOTHING like the Sigma we know.
<Zero>  I bet my Z-Buster that we're going to be the only ones that can 
stop them.

He nails Ayeka with a left hook that sends 
her flying through a wall of the house. Sigma looks at Washu 
"Seems it's down to you and me again!" 

<JS>  Basically, he just said all that extra battle stuff was 
irrelevant.

In space X and Zero 
finally make it to the teleport room. X puts Zero on the 
teleport strip. "All that's left is to enter the code 
and...ahhh!!" The controls fry X. 

<Meis> (X)  PAIN!

"Teleportation is locked on 
Sigma's orders." X hits the control pannel. 

<JS>  A new and improved version of--*BLAM*  Ouch.
<Samus>  That'll teach you not to beat a joke to death.

"How do we get out 
now, Zero I need your help" 

<JS>  He seems to have found one of the last surviving commas, but I 
guess there were no other punctuations near it.

Zero takes out his teleportation 
device "I don't have enough energy to use it." X puts it on " 
But I do ,here we go Zero back to Earth" Activating teleporter 
now. X is teleported off the ship. Zero laying down smiles "It 
can only teleport 1 person." "ship destruction in 10.... 
9....8.....7....6....5....4....3....2....1" 

<JS>  Three, two, one, CONTACT!

The ship explodes. 

<All>  POP!

X 
is finds himself inside the Masaki home. "Nooooo!! He knew it 
only teleported 1 person. How could he?" Tears come from X's 
eyes. He hears the fighting outside. He powers up his blaster to 
maximum power and heads out. Sigma has just finished off Washu.

<Washu>  I would just teleport a freakin' building on his head and get 
it over with!
 
"I HAVE WON NO ONE CAN BEAT ME." 

<JS>  He seems to have killed off the rest of the commas.  A pity, they 
were such good punctuations.

X steps out "I CAN!!!!!" X lets 
all off his energy out in a single blast. Sigma is destroyed by 
the blast. 

<Zero>  HA!  I knew it!
<X>  Wow, I didn't know I could do that, did you, Zero?

X goes to check on Washu. " X you're alive. So where 
is Zero?" X turns away " I'm..huff sorry..huff.. he was banged 
up pretty badly and didn't have enough energy to use the 
teleportation device. 

<Washu>  I guess he doesn't want the wrath of Washu brought upon him.
<Invictus>  What do you mean by that?
<Washu>  Did you see a word in that dialogue saying that most of the 
damage was caused by X?
<Invictus>  You're right!

He gave it to me and I thought it would 
get us both home but he knew it wouldn't I'm sorry." Washu gets 
up "It's ok" Tears wells up in her eyes as X goes to cheak on 
the others.

<JS>  Ouch, that one hurt.  How can you possibly spell "check" wrong?

              A couple of days later in the Masaki house The 
whole family is sitting at the table eating except Washu. Tenchi 
starts the conversation " That way one tough fight." 

<Washu>  I hope he meant "was" not "way", or else Tenchi has gone crazy.
<Meis> (Tenchi as Homer Simpson)  No beer or TV make Tenchi go CRAZY!

Ayeka 
agrees " That Sigma was super strong." 

<Samus> (Sarcastically)  Gee, you think he could've beaten you that 
badly if he wasn't?

Ryoko interupts 

<JS>  He misspelled "interrupts".

"We would 
have lost if X hadn't come, we would have been toast." 

<Washu>  I like mine with butter!

X who has 
been adjusting to human life is silent " I wish Zero had come 
instead of me. I know that I can never be forgiven expecially by 
Washu." 

<Meis> Oh, so he did tell her.  And probabll had the crap beaten outof 
him, but I guess the author didn't want to torture us with the details.

Yosho consoles him " Don't beat yourself up. She is just 
in her lab greiving for the last couple of days. This family is 
in debt to you for saving us." Just then Washu comes up from her 
lab. All is silent. 

<All> (Crickets) CHIRP, CHIRP.....

X walks over to her  and brings her to the 
table "Miss Washu I am just so sorry I couldn't save him." Washu 
cracks a smile " You could help being controled. 

<X>  I could?

Besides Zero 
probably thinks that as a crowning achievement being able to 
save his brother." Suddenly the lights go out and a cold wind 
blows in from an open window. 

<JS>  Now THERE'S the trademark "Batman entrance"!

Tenchi gets up to shut the window. 
As soon as the window is closed the lights come back on. Sasami 
asks "What was that all about?" Washu answers "Probably just the 
wind hitting a power line or something. I'll check the lab 
scanners." She heads into the lab. She boots up her main 
computer only to see something on the table. It was Zero's sword

<Zero>  GODDAMMIT,  IT'S A SABER!
<JS>  Aren't they the same thing?
<Zero>  NO!!!
<JS>  ^__^; Okay, okay!
 
with a note attached to it!! It reads "Be seeing you soon" -
Zero. Washu cries tears of joy as she turns around to see Zero. 
" But how did you..." 

<All>  WHO CARES?!

Zero cuts her off "Does it even matter?" 
She jumps into his arms for a long passionate kiss. He would 
eventually tell them all about his escape but for now he happy 
to be in the arms of the one he loved.

END 

<All>  HALLELUJAH!

EPILOGUE

<All>  CRAP!
<JS> (Reduced Shakespeare and Co., singing, with air guitar) EPILOGUE! 
And Romeo, and Juliet are deeEEEAD!  WOO!
<All but JS>  O__o;
<JS> (Plugging RSC)  Buy a copy of The Reduced Shakespeare Company, and 
learn what real humor is!

5 days later after the destruction of Sigma the family finally 
finds out how Zero got out. "So dear brother how did you get 
out" X asked. 

<Zero>  Dammit, I'm not his brother!  In fact, we were created by two 
completely opposite people!

The whole family wanted to know. Come to the 
living room and I'll tell you. They all head for the living 
room. Ryoko phases through the wall. Tenchi and Ayeka run into 
the room.Sasami and Ryo-Ohki were already there, Yosho and Washu 
walk in. And Zero and X walk in wearing two good looking suits.

<X>  Great, now we're suits.
<JS> (Looking at readers)  If you know ANYTHING about the Mafia, then 
you know what he's talking about.
 
Zero sits next to Washu. "So you ready to hear it?" Everyone 
screams "Yes!!" 

<JS>  Hey, he actually used proper punctuation!

"OK then, this is what happened. As I lay there 
my worthless life passed before my eyes.

<Zero>  Geez, that was harsh.

My birth with Dr.Light , 

<Zero>  WHAAAAAT?!
<JS>  I'm taking a wild guess here, but I don't think this guy has 
played any of the X games except number one.  And that one only 
explained how X was created.
<Zero>  Yeah, who doesn't know that Dr. Wily created me?  There were 
numerous hints dropped in each game!  I mean, it shows his silhouette 
laughing at me in X four!  And I even have a W in my helmet gem, see?  
(Shows W to everyone)
<All> (Amazed)  Ooooooooooo......

my time working for Sigma , being fixed by Dr. Cain and my time 
here on this Earth. Then I heard a familiar voice. It said " Get 
up Zero your time isn't up yet!" I looked around and saw Dr. 
Cain standing before me! 

<X>  He's officially lost it.

I thought I was losing it. 

<X>  See?

But when he 
picked me up and carried me into one of those capsules Dr. Light 
had made 

<X>  They're called Armor Capsules.

I knew I hadn't lost it. Once inside the capsule we 
were transported to my original dimension of Earth. Once inside 
his lab he repaired my armor and I told him about my upgrade and 
he was surprised. 

<JS>  What a run-on!

He said that Dr. Light would be so proud of 
me. 

<Zero>  Or Dr. Wily, whomever you prefer.

After my armor was fixed I changed into my human form and he 
put me in the healing tank. A couple of hours later I was back 
on top of the world. 

<Zero> (Jack)  I'm king of the world!

The doc directed me to  one of the capsules 
and it brought me back here." Everyone agreed it was quite a 
story. 

<X>  More like a crock of shit, to me.
<Washu>  I'm warning you, watch your mouth!

"Oh yeah before I forget Washu I told him about you and 
he gave me a gift for you." Washu looks shocked "Oh what can it 
be. A death ray a  new more powerful metal?" 

<JS>  RUN-ON!

Zero reaches in his 
pocket and  pulls out a key. Washu falls back. 

<Washu>  I HOPE he meant I did a facefault.

"A key is what 
you brought back how unscientific."

<Washu>  Now THAT'S something I would say.

Zero smiles "Not just any 
key but a key that can take you anywhere, granted you've been 
there before. All you do is stick it into any key hole think of 
the place you want to be open the door and your there." 

<X>  Wow, and here I thought Dr. Cain was just a stupid old geezer nly 
good for repairing me.  Apparently, he's smarter than Washu.
<Washu>  HEY!

Washu 
looks at the key with different eyes now " Wow not even I the 
greatest scientific genius in the universe couldn't have made 
something like this." Zero laughs " Maybe you're not the 
greatest....." 

<Washu> (Face turns red, starts breathing fire)  WHAT?!
<All but Washu>  ^__^;  EEK!

Washu turns her head slowly to face Zero "What 
did you say?" Zero with a nervous smile "Nothing of importance"

<Zero>  Great, now I sound like a nerd.
 
Washu smiling "Good  because if you had said I wasn't the 
greatest scientific genius in the universe I'd have to 
experiment on you. Isn't that right Tenchi?" Tenchi gulps "Yeah" 
but he thinks "Why'd she put me into this." Washu gets up "So 
who wants to try the key out." Zero thinks "Knowing her she'll 
but us into some comet or star to see how long we can last."

<JS>  I'm not touching that one.
 
Zero  gets up "Well I gotta go to work .Bye"  X gets up too 
"Zero said he'd help me look for a job uh bye" 

<JS>  ARGH!  Doesn't this person know what a comma is?!

Both scramble to 
get out of the house. Washu grins ear to ear now. " Well that 
just leaves you 4" Pointing to Sasami, Ryoko, Ayeka and Tenchi.  
They  looked shocked. 

<Invictus>  PIKA-CHUUUU!  *BLAMBLAMBLAM*  OW.
<JS> (Blowing smoke away freom J-Buster)  I thought I told you, no 
Pokemon references!

Tenchi tries to persuade her out of it but 
to no avail. "Oh come on we're just going to places I've been  
no where dangerous."   

<Invictus>  Knowing her, she'll probably drop them on Catachan.
<All but JS and Invictus>  What's that?
<invictus>  It's the deadliest deathworld in the universe.  You touch 
ANYTHING moving there, they'll bite your head off or poison you.
<All but JS and Invictus>  Ewwww.
<X>  JS, you know what that place is?
<JS>  Yup.  Got the Catachan's Codex right here! (Holds up a book)
<All but JS>  ^__^;  Uh-huh.

She drags all four of them to the door 
"Here we go" She uses the key opens the door and throws the gang 
in. "You guys tell me what you find I'll be back in an hour" was 
the last words she said before she closed the door taking the 
key out. "WASHU  DON'T LEAVE US IN 
HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<X>  Jesus, that's a lot of exclamation points.

A little distance away a lone figure in the shadows chuckles, " 
Play now Zero, but in the begining there were 7 and in the end 
there was only one." 

<JS>  I did not understand that at all, did you guys? (Nobody raises 
their hand)

SO  WHAT DID YOU THINK? EMAIL ME AT MSHOWMONEY@AOL.COM

<All>  SHOW ME THE MONEY!
--------All exit the theater--------
<JS>  So, what'd you guys think?
<Washu>  Blechhh.  I married Zero.
<Zero>   Blechhh. I married Washu.
<JS>  ^__^; Yes, well, besides that, what did you think of it?
<Zero>  It was kind of good. I give it a four out of ten.  But this guy 
really needs to learn a little bit more about me.
<Washu>  The story was good, but there were some plot holes.  I'd 
say....six out of ten.
<X>  I didn't like it one bit!  One out of ten!
<JS>  I kinda figured you'd say that, seeing as you were the bad guy in 
the story.
<Invictus>  Nothing really stood out to me, but nothing really was bad, 
either.  five out of ten.
<Meis> I liked it.  I'd give it a seven out of ten.   I especially liked 
the part where Washu said BOOBS!  *KLONG*  OW!
<Washu> (Putting hammer away) You were just ASKING for that one.
<Samus>  The plot was a good one, having the hero become the villain, 
but it wasn't THAT good.  Three out of ten.
<JS>  And, as for me, this is what I thought.  The spelling was bad, the 
punctuation was horrible, the un-ons were annoying, and the lack of 
knowledge of Zero was painful.  Looking beyond that, it was a somewhat 
good story.  Four out of ten.
<JS>  Well, with that one finished, who wants to play me to a game of 
Twisted Metal four?
<Meis>  I'll grill your ass!
<JS>  Bring it on, sissy boy!

				The End

<JS>  This was a good story, but lousy when it comes to grammar, 
punctuation, and spelling.  I think that, with a little more thought put 
into it, the author could make it a really good fic.  And he should also 
use a spellcheck.
