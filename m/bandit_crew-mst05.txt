::As the abandoned prison ship,the SS Bandit,floated lifelessly through space,its
homicidle crew set plotting on what poor soul to bring aboard for their next
mst,In the recreation room we see 6 individuals,sitting on a futon is a young
woman around the age of fifteen,dressed in a now faded pair of black over-alls
and a pine green tee shirt with a happy face with fangs on it.Her blonde hair
is hanging loosely down to her shoulders this would be Demon,next to her sits a tall 
young man,dressed in a tattered gaurd uniform and written on the name card is 
"Hello,my name is Psyco"and covering his dirty blonde hair is a red bandanna.
Sitting at the poker table is a young man with a Darth Vader type mask on and a long black cloak,
this is Uhsaw,beside of him is a boy in preacher garb,he is the fan-fic operater Chris.Then we zoom
into a corner of the room where a fur clad young man seems to be eating some sort of meat,
this boy has a shaved head and red eyes,we know him as Jimmy the Evil.Next to him
sits the last memeber of the crew,he is wearing a brown leather vest,no shirt and a pair
of wool pants,his bleached hair is abit curly and this would be Hunter J::

<Uhsaw>Hurry up and pick!
<Psyco>But I say we should let Mr.Peanut join the crew!
<Demon>Uh-uh,I think it should be Mihoshi
<Hunter>Its gonna be Goku!
<Jimmy>No,its gonna be Misty from Pokemon!
<Chris>May I suggest that you bring Prince Yosho on board?
<All>NO!
<Uhsaw>Well hurry up im not getting any younger..
::With this Demon,Psyco,Jimmy,Chris and Hunter J go into a huddle,then after some talking
they break::
<Psyco>We have decided...
<Jimmy>That a good choice...
<Hunter>Would be...
<Chris>None other then
<Demon>Tenchi Masaki!
<Uhsaw>It is written,so it shall be done!
::As Uhsaw says this,he phases into his room and reappears on the wide screen TV on the wall,
in his hands he holds a rope and tied to the other end is a young man in a school uniform,with brown
hair and he seems scared to death,then he is teleported to where the rest of the crew is
while Chris goes into the theater's projection room::
<Tenchi>(looking around)Where,where am I?
<Demon>Hello Tenchi and welcome to Hell,population 8
<Jimmy>Your on the SS Bandit
<Tenchi>Isnt that a prison ship?
<All>(nod)
<Tenchi>Well what am I doing here?
<Psyco>Your our guest mster
<Tenchi>I dont like the sound of that...
::The sharp squeal of a siren can be heard,and Uhsaw and Chris reapear on the screen::
<Uhsaw>You know what that means maggots!
<Demon>(rolling her eyes)Is it story time?
<Uhsaw>Get your smart asses into that theater!
<Everyone>(make a wild dash into the ship's theater)
::As everyone gets seated,Tenchi finds hisself being tied to one of the seats::
<Tenchi>Whats going on,come on guys this is'nt funny
<Hunter>It's for your own protection
::The theater goes dark and Chris apears on the movie screen,holding a roll of film in his hand::
<Chris>Okay,today you guys will be watching,"Everybody has secrets"and low and behold,its a lemon,enjoy!
<Jimmy>(imitating Snagglepuss)Anything but a lemon,an apple even..or maybe a orange even
::Chris dissapears and a paragraph apears on the screen::
  

	Everybody has secrets

	In this lemon Sasami, Aeka, Ryoko and Mihoshi all live in 
	Tenchi's house. The old man Tenchi lives with (can't remember 
	his name) is away, somewhere 'cause I didn't want him in this 
	story. Sasami and Aeka shares room, the other ones all have 
	their own rooms.

<Demon>Wha?Wheres the disclaimer?
<Jimmy>(looks around)I dont see it..
<Hunter>Lucy!You have some splain'n ta do!

It was around 03:45 when Tenchi woke up, he had a really nice 
dream about himself, Aeka and Ryoko fucking.

<All>(look at Tenchi)0.o
<Tenchi>Well everyone can dream,hehe

He wondered why he had awakened and then realized that he 
heard noices from the living-room.

<Jimmy>(imtates Tenchi)Ohh no their at it again,maybe if I wish really hard
it will be an orgy instead of a cat-fight
<Tenchi>(nose-bleeds)

He took his sword and slowly walked down the stairs. But there 
was nobody there so he went up to the second floor again and 
when he was walking past Sasamis door, he noticed that the 
light was on in her room, he saw light coming out from her 
keyhole and the gap under her door.

<Demon>She should get that gap in her door fixed
<Jimmy>Yeah,wouldnt want any perverts barging in

 He peeked through the keyhole and he was really suprised by what he saw. 
Sasami stood infront of the mirror and stripped while fingering her 
pussy! She wa only wearing a kimono so the striptease was 
short. Tenchi felt his teenage cook rise

<Hunter>(looks to Tenchi)You have a cook?
<Tenchi>No!And if I did he wouldnt rise up everytime I saw one of the girls
masterbaitng
<Demon>(as Emeril Lugasi)Bam!

 and thought:s"Maybe I shouldn't do this, she has her own private life, 
like everybody else. But still, this doesn't happen so often!"
He continued to watch and she was now completely naked. She 
sat on her bed and her legs were wide apart and she had a big 
dildo that she drow up in her pussy.
 
<Jimmy>Is'nt a drow a dark elf?
<Demon>Yeah,I suppose
<Psyco>Then whats it doing,ohh god!
<Tenchi>(has a nose himerage)

She drow it up and down for a minute or two, then she drow it faster 
and faster and then she finally came. She then hid the dildo under her bed. 
Tenchi stopped looking and realized that Sasami was sharing 
room with Aeka!

<Psyco>and dont forget the elf too..
<Hunter>O.O

 The keyhole was big so he could see Aekas bed 
too, but it was empty. Then he heard someone walking up the 
stairs. He returned to his room and peeked trhough his keyhole 
to see who it was. It was Ryoko! She sneaked inside her room 
and after rhat mihoshi came and sneaked inside her room. 

<Demon>Old Mr.Webster would be pissed right now
<Hunter>Anyway,why would Ryoko sneak into her own room?
<Tenchi>She has a room?She always uses mine!

What the hell did they all do in the middle of the night? Tenchi 
was clueless so he walked back to his bed to sleep.

<Psyco>(glares at Tenchi)Now let me get this straight,they may have been
pawing and clawing at each other,but you just waltz on to bed
<Tenchi>That is'nt me!Im a pervert really!
<Demon>Heh,just ask Sasami

Next day

Tenchi woke up around 10:20. He went down to the kitchen and 
everybody was there eating breakfeast.
They didn't act strange or anything, everything were as it 
always had been, Sasami ate cereals quietly but
When she saw Tenchi she started yappin about a lot of shit.

::Note from the Bandit Crew,from this point on we are going to ignore all 
grammer mistakes and spelling errors,Thank you::
 
Tenchi did'nt lissen, he was looking on Ryoko and Aeka as they 
were fighting abouy wich one of them Tenchi likes the most, as 
usual. Mihoshi was starring at the TV, it was a rerun they 
show every morning, but Mihoshi didn't care. Maybe she was 
thinking of something else.

<Demon>(as Mihoshi,thinking)How many licks does it take to get to the center
of a toosie pop?
<Jimmy>I dont think thats what shes thinki'n about

Later that they, Sasami suggested they'd go out and camp. 
Everybody was in for it. So they decided they would go around 
18.00 to the camping place and stay there until the next day.

<Psyco>Wait,wait,are they going by army time now?
<Hunter>No,just eastern idiot time
 

Aeka: Are we going to have or own tents or is everybody going 
to be in the same?
Mihoshi: Waht does it matter?

<Tenchi>Well Ayeka wets the bed,so a tent should'nt be any different Mihoshi
<Jimmy>Thats cold,man

Aeka: Well there is someone I don't want to have in the same 
romm as me when I sleep
Ryoko: She doesn't like you Tenchi.
Aeka: I ment you, you stupid little slut!
Aeka ran upstairs crying

<Demon>Did'nt Ayeka just call Ryoko a slut?
<Others>Yeah
<Demon>Well then why does she have her own feeligs hurt?

Ryoko: Cute, isn't she?

<Demon>(blushes)Yeah,I try to be

Tenchi: Well, maybe we should have double tents so two persons 
fit each. Sasami, will you share with Aeka?
Sasami: Yep, Sasami share with Aeka!

<Jimmy>Thats first person narration
<Demon>Yeah,Demon does'nt like to mst shit like this,because Demon rules
<Hunter>Abit conceeded are we?
<Demon>Are you being a smartass to Demon?Dont make Demon kick your ass


Tenchi: Mihoshi, you and Ryoko.

<Jimmy>Theres another lemon that starts with that...
<Psyco>Dont bring that up!

Mihoshi: Ok.
Ryoko: Why not you and me Tenchi.
Tenchi: Erg. I'll take the single tent.

<Hunter>Because Tenchi has a date with Rosey Palm and her five friends
<Demon>He needs his privacy
<Tenchi>(trying to break the ropes that hold his chair)Hey!



Later

As planned, they left by 18:00, and after an hour of walking, 
they were finally there.

<Psyco>What planet do they live on?Pluto?
<Jimmy>This whole time thing is really getting to you,huh?
<Psyco>More then you will ever know

It was already dark and it took a while for them to set up the 
tents. Ryoko made up fire with one finger,
But since it's a magic finger,

<Hunter>(as annoying anouncer man)Yes,and you too can have your own
magic finger for the itroductery price of only 19.99,and if you call right now
we will throw in a state of the art magic anus!Just call 1-800-555-666
<Demon>(really fast)Offers may very from state to state,if you really do call 
this number you will be subjected to sale your soul to the Bandit crew,this offer
is invalid everywhere except Mars,offer expires 5002,The Bandit Crew does not test
it's products on politicians,any harmful uv rays emitted from this offer are
completly not our fault

 it's not so hard. They sat 
around the fire for a while and ate Daikou misou soup.
They were really hungry after the long walk. By 23:30 they 
decided to sleep.

<Psyco>(grits his teeth)

 Tenchi couldn't sleep. He only thought about 
what the girls was doing last night. He sneaked outside his 
tent and noticed that when the girls had a flash light on in 
their tents, the tents was almost transparent! Since it was 
dark outside and the flashlights was not so good, they 
couldn't see him.

<Demon>(as Mihoshi)Ohh,huh huh,do you hear that Ryoko?
<Hunter>(as Ryoko)No I dont hear a thing,now lay down bitch!
<Jimmy>Now whos a fraid of the big bad hentai?

 So he lay down on the ground only 3 meters from Sasami and Aekas tent
And 5 meters from Mihoshi and Ryokos tent. He can see them all 
perfectly clear. Mihoshi and Sasami leaves their tents and 
enter the other ones. So Aeka and Mihoshi are in a tent and 
Sasami and Ryoko in the other.

<Tenchi>This just keep getting wierder and weirder
<Demon>I just thought of something scary
<Hunter>What?
<Demon>What if this is a never ending story?
<All>AHHHHHH!!!

Tenchi is surprised when he sees that Mihoshi is taking her 
clothes of so that she only have her panties on.
Aeka does that too. Tenchis cook rises when he sees Aekas sexy 
breasts.

<Jimmy>(as Tenchi's "cook")Now those are soma fine chicken breasts
<Tenchi>For the last time I dont have a cook!Sasami does all of the cooking!
<Emeril Lugasi and Demon>Bam!

 The two girls lies down in Aekas bed and starts to 
hug each other, then they starts to kiss each other all over 
and Mihoshi licks Aekas breasts, she seems to like them too. 
Aeka stands up and takes of her panties. Techi can only see 
her beautiful ass now.

<Tenchi>Yep thats one fine donkey ya got there
<Jimmy>I dont think they meant that kinda ass

Aeka lies down and Mihoshi is licking Aekas pussy hard. She 
wants to moan but then she knows the tents aren't so sound 
proof. Oh I'm coming Mihoshi, she whispers. I'm coming! Oh 
yeah! Oh!!!!!!!

<Demon>(covers her ears)Thats one loud whisper
<Jimmy>(convulsing)Well your not the one sitting next to the speaker

Aeka cms in Mihoshis face. Now Aeka is finger-fucking Mihoshis 
shiny little pussy.

<Hunter>What does she do,wax it?
<Demon>(pulls out the ancient stone slab of hentai bludgening 
and bashes him in the head)
<Hunter>(has a huge lump on his head)Ouch!
<Demon>Let that be a lesson and warning to anyone else who wants
to be a pervert!

Mihoshi cant hold out for so long so she cms too. Tenchi 
returns to his tent. He can see that Sasami and Ryoko is 
talking and that Ryoko leaves the tent. She's approaching 
Tenchis tent! He pretends to sleep when Ryoko enters his tent 
uninvited.
"Tenchi! Did you like what you saw in Aekas tent?"

<Tenchi>Hmm,maybe..(rubs his chin)

"Snooore"
"I know you're awake Tenchi. 
She sits behind him and starts to take off her clothes.
When she's fully naked, she lay down next to him and starts to 
kiss his neck.
What are you doing Ryoko!?

<Psyco>(as Ryoko)Ohh im just checking for neck lice

I knew you were awake Tenchi. Come on! I know you want to!
Oh Alright!
Hmm! Your dick is hard! So you did like what you saw!
Tenchi (red face): Umm.

<Tenchi>(holding his nose)I would be getting a nose bleed right about now

Ryoko: Come on! Show me what you got
She undresses him in a second and starts to ride him. She 
slides up and down, back and forward slowly
He's grabbing her ass now and squeezes it with his hands as 
she rides faster and faster.

<Hunter>Hi Ho Ryoko!Away!
<Jimmy>Giddy-up!

Oh TENCHI! OH, OH, OH!
She's riding him as fast as she can now!
Tenchi feels his gonna cum soon and ryoko sees that on his 
face.

<Jimmy>(points to the screen)Yep its stamped on his forehead

 So she stops and starts to suck his big cook instead.

<Hunter>Looks like she lost interest in you and decided to suck on your cook
<Tenchi>For the last time!I do not have a cook!
<Emeril Lugasi>Bam!...ZZZAPPP!(falls over dead)
<Psyco>(Hides a castor and throws some garlic on his body)Thats kick'n it
up a notch

 It doesn't take long before he cums and Ryoko seems happy.

<Jimmy>It seems like Ryoko did all the work
<Tenchi>Im lazy that way

She returns to her tent and Tenchi falls asleep, with a smile 
on his face.

<Hunter>She didnt even bother to put her clothes back on?
<Jimmy>Shes probably not done with Mihoshi and Ayeka
<Demon>(lifts up the slab of hentai bludgening then sets it back down)Its 
not worth it,they will just do it again



Man its really hard to write these lemons,

<Jimmy>Try reading them

If you think it was good, won't you please mail me with your 
comments?

<Demon>Ohh your gonna get comments

for profit or get any credits for it

<All>(roll around laughing,Tenchi jumps up and down in his chair)
<Hunter>(wiping a tear from her eyes)Whoo,hoo,hoo

<Psyco>Were shaking

::At this the screen goes blank and the lights come back on,nearly blinding
the crew,then Uhsaw and Chris appear on screen::
<Uhsaw>Was it scary enough?
<Jimmy>We hate you so very much Uhsaw
<Psyco>And Chris you better not ever talk to us again!
::Everyone exits the theater,leaving Tenchi tied to his seat and the lights go out 
again::

::In the recreation room...::
