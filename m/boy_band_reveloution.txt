                    No
Sasami Screamed
Yes
Aieka Yelled
Shut up you two
Ryoko Said
Lets go kill them
She continued
Who
Tenchi Said
The Boy Bad Revolution That's who
Washu Laughed
OK
Ryoko agreed
Lets go now
Aieka said
But I love 'n sync, 98 degrees, backstreet boys, five and more
Said sasami
Then you should go to hell you bastard
Yelled Ryoko
Aieka tossed a brick at sasami and knocked the little bitch senseless
Ouch
Sasami said and fell over dead
Lets go bitches
Tenchi said
They all ran off to the boy band concert

They arrived
Ryoko got up front and giggled
She knew I would be fun to kill them all
Aieka laughed at the thought that her sister lay dead at home
Tenchi was waiting for wahsu'signal to attack
And when she wove her hand he through a dart up  at 'nsync
It knocked J.C. in the artree and he tumbled over on the rest of all
bands.
Back home, people roasted marshmellows over sasamis dead body in
delight of all the deaths.
