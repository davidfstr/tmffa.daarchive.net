boomed over the intercom.
<Uhsaw>Everyone report to the theater or else!
<Psyco>Or else what?
<Bob>(Comes on giant screen holding a video)Ever heard of "At the Carrot Patch"?
<Everyone>(Runs to the theater)
	As everyone enters the theater and gets seated,the lights start to dim,and Bob appears on
the screen.
<Bob>Today you cretens will be veiwing a fic,I like to call "Da Demon Squad"Enjoy,and remeber all
stress balls and barf bags are under your seats.
Then Bob disappears and a paragraph appears on the screen.
			
Tenchi and Crew belong to whoever created them.I dont own anyone except Ryo-oki
  (Nah i'm just kidding but a person can dream)So please dont sue me...)

<Demon>(Holds up cage containing a small cabbit)I kidnapped Ryo-ohki does that count?
<Jimmy>(Grabs cabbit out of cage and starts eating it)
<Syllia>Gross!
<Chris>Ohh yeah that'll score ya some points with Ryoko...

This fic is called "Da Demon Squad" and it's written by me Bob

<Hunter>Ohh God Bob wrote this...?
<Demon>Now I know I dont want to watch this
<Hunter>(Whispers in Demon's ear)Well baby me and you could....(ZZZZAAAP!)
<Psyco>(slides a tazor and car battery under his seat,and whistles innocently)
<Everyone>(Except Hunter whos convulsing on the floor)?
<Psyco>I might have just saved his life,ya know...

It was a beautiful sunny day at the Masaki house everyone were doing what they normaly do,Sasami
was cooking,Ryoko and Ayeka were fighting,Washu was in her lab,Kiyone and Mihoshi were sleeping,
while Tenchi and Yosho were at the shrine training.Yep it seemed like any other beautiful day at
Masaki house,but no one knew what was about to happen next....

<Scyllia>(As Sasami)I'm going ta go psyco and kill everyone...
<Psyco>(As Tenchi)I'm going to tell everyone that i'm in love with Ryo-ohki...
<Hunter>(As Ayeka)I'm going to confess my love to Ryoko...
<Chris>(As Washu)I'm going to tell everyone that i'm carrying Yosho's baby...
<Demon>(As Ryoko)I'm going to become a nun and kill Tenchi....

As Tenchi finished up his training,he felt the ground rumble,then a crack appeared on the surface,

<Jimmy>(Farts)Damn Cabbit

Then out of the earth came three men,one looked like Kagato,the other two had horns and looked like
well hell,.Tenchi,upon seeing this,pulled out Tenchiken and prepared for a battle."Who are you 
and what do you want...?"Tenchi said as the one who looked like Kagato also drew a sword."Well
young man,I just came for my daughter.""Who are you?"he asked again."you should know boy you killed
me.""Kagato?"Tenchi said as the two demon type creatures came up behind him and grabbed his arms,
knocking Tenchiken to the ground.Kagato then kicked the sword into a nearby pond,and beckoned
the two demons toward the Masaki house.

<Psyco>(As annoying anouncer guy)Yes kids stay tuned for the action packed adventures of the
new Tenchi Muyo! series 'Tenchi no Baka'
<Demon>That was lame man
<Psyco>(mumbles under breath)you could'nt come up with anything better,ya penny ho..
<Demon>I heard that greaseball!

Outside of the Masaki house Ryoko and Ayeka were sunning themselves."Hey Ayeka,have you seen 
Tenchi?"Sasami asked from the door."No Sasami I have'nt."Ayeka said as she shot up to find Ryoko
looking off into the woods."Here he comes,but he's not alone"Ryoko said,turning her head,her eyes 
unblinking."What do you mean not alone!"Shouted Ayeka as she set back down."There seems to be a strong
force surrounding him.Then Ryoko lifted her head and sniffed the air."Kagato!"she mumbled as she set down
beside of Ayeka.

<Chris>(immitates Ryoko and sniffs the air)I smell a bad plot
<Hunter>No thats Jimmy
<Demon>(Sprays some febreeze)Yeah that cabbit gave him gas

Then the woods were enveloped in a blast of red light,and Kagato and the two demons,along with
Tenchi emerge from the woods."Ahh,theres my baby girl"laughed Kagato as Ryoko's eyes suddenly
turned red.

<Demon>Yep Rabies will do that to ya

And with out warning the spacepirate jumped Ayeka.Then as the princess's little energy bars
formed around Ryoko,the two demons released Tenchi and they grabbed Ryoko,who was trapped by
Ayeka's energy field.Snarling and growling,Ryoko was completly under Kagato's control again.Then
out of the house came Washu."What do you want with her Kagato?"the red head asked.

<Psyco>wait is'nt Washu's hair hot pink?
<Demon>Well is'nt this author stupid?
<Scyllia>And waters wet tell me somethi'n I dont know...

"Well professor,I just want joint custody of my daughter.."smiled Kagato."You slime,she is not your daughter!"
Washu screamed as a blade went through the small scientist.As she fell to the ground standing behind her
was one of the demons,with a switchblade in his hand and a smile on his face."WASHU!"Tenchi screamed
as he ran over two her lifeless body.He checked for a pulse and found that she did'nt have one.Then with tears in
his eyes he looked at Ryoko,who was being restrained by one of the demons."Boss,should we let her go?"
the demon asked as Sasami hugged Ayeka and began crying.

<Demon>(As Sasami)Ayeka if he lets Ryoko go,she'll kill Tenchi first and we will never be out of this crappy
fic...
<Hunter>(Grabs Scyllia)Hold me,i'm scared!
<Scyllia>Hey you perv,it's ten bucks an hour to touch those!

"Yes let her go,she will avenge my death!"laughed Kagato as the demon let Ryoko go,but to his suprise she jumped him and tore the demon to peices
"Ungrateful girl!what are you doing?"Shouted Kagato as Tenchiken floated out of the lake and flew to Tenchi
Then Tenchi summoned the swords power and destroyed Kagato,sending him back to where he came.

<Jimmy>I have to go drop Ryo-ohki off at the pool..
<Everyone else>Yeah we need a break too
Then the picture pauses and the Bandit crew go into the recreation room.
<Hunter>Umm Scyllia I have something to show you in my room...
<Scyllia>Ohh no i'm not falling for that again
<Demon>What is it?
<Hunter>Just follow me
As Demon follows Hunter,Chris closes his bible.
<Chris>There all done
<Psyco>You read all that?
<Scyllia>Wow you can read!
<Jimmy>(walking out of the bathroom)Ahh thats better
<Uhsaw>Everyone back into the theater
<Chris>But what about Demon and Hunter?
<Uhsaw>Well,just go into the theater,i will send them when I see them,and dont worry
the fic will be paused.
As everybody else goes into the theater,Hunter and Demon come down the steps,Hunter slips his
shirt on over some fresh scratch marks on his back,and he zips his pants,Demon whos hair is messed up
wipes something from the corner of her mouth.
<Uhsaw>GET TO THE THEATER NOW!
<Demon>yeah,thats nice...
<Uhsaw>NOW!!!!!  
As Demon and Hunter get seated in the theater the fic starts again.
<Everyone>AHHH Man!

Then as Kagato and the remaining demon went back to 'that place'Sasami ran over to Washu,and using the powers of Tsunami
brought her back to life.Ryoko passed out and woke up two days later."Well everthings back to normal"
Tenchi said as he picked some carrots out of the carrot patch.

<Jimmy>And we all know what happens at the carrot patch!
<Demon>(Holds a knife to Jimmy'throat)Never mention that fic again you bastard!
<Jimmy>(Holding his throat)O-tay!

This Fic was my first try,So dont knock it before ya try it!

<Jimmy>That aint what Demon said to Hunter a few minutes ago!
<Demon>(still combing her hair)Shut-up laughing boy

Anyway send all of your praises to me at bobarama@yahoo.com.
Also send any falmes you might have.

<Psyco>(Holding up a falme thrower)Ohh dont worry Bobby you'll get flamed..
Then as the screen went blank and the lights came back on,the crew got up and headed back to the recreation room.
<Bob>so how did you like the fic?
<Chris>The only good thing about it was that it was short!
<Demon & Scyllia>(mumble)thats not the only thing of Bob's thats short...
<Bob>I heard that!
<Uhsaw>Everyone it's time for lights out!
As Uhsaw says this Demon and Hunter smile at each other and head off to bed,Chris goes into an
empty cell and fall asleep on the bed,while Psyco is already asleep on the kitchen table.Scyllia heads
off to her cell as Jimmy curls up and dozes off.
