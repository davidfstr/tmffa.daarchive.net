	<Battle with Soja, take one>

GP Officer:All ships, lock on tar-(Boom hits officer in
forehead, knocking off fake ear)hheeeeeyyyyyyy..(Falls [very] quickly to floor)

Director:(cracks up)Medic!

	<Mihoshi first view take one>

Mihoshi:(Hears emergency call, Stands up, and walks to the 
bridge)Hello?

Director:Mihoshi!!  You're supposed to trip!

Mihoshi:(In english accent) Well, I say, it is physically
impossible for me to act in such a manner!  What IS my motivation?

	<Masaki family arrival at Onsen, take one>

Sasami:C'mon Aeka, lets-(Trips and falls on face out of minivan)

Tenchi:(Cracks up)Hey, Sasami, that was a good one. Uh..Sasami?
MEDIC!!

	<Tenchi unloading the van, take one>
Ryoko:(floating vertically next to the open door of the minivan) I'm
telling you, that girl-(Ryoko screams and falls suddenly,
accompanied by the sounds of strings snapping)Owww...

Tenchi:(Cracks up)

Ryoko:(Grabs his foot and pulls him down.  Cracks up)

	<Tenchi unloading the van, take two>

Ryoko:Tenchiiii... I want you to flirt with me, too!

Tenchi:Aww, get serious!

Ryoko:Well fine, you can flirt with Aeka but you can't flirt
with me? (disappears)

Tenchi:(Turns to finish unloading van.  Suddenly, the suitcases
float into the air and fly at Tenchi.  A small handbag strikes
him in the pills)(in high-pitched voice)CUT!  (Falls down in
fetal position)

Aeka:(Runs up to Tenchi) You didn't hurt anything important, did
you Tenchi? (inspects him)Whew.  It's all there.  Roll 'em!

	<Tenchi in the hotsprings, take one>

Nobuyuki:Tenchi, we're here at the hotsprings...And there are
a couple of ladies over there in the women's bath(leans forward)
It would be really rude not to peek.

Tenchi:The hostess will kill us if she finds out.

Nobuyuki:I'm not afraid of her at all. (pulls towel over his head)

Tenchi:So, what's with the towel, Dad?

Nobuyuki:Numbskull, this is the traditional attire for peeping!
(starts climbing)

Tenchi:Dad, cut it out, you're-(Tenchi is cut off by Nobuyuki 
screaming, some thumping sounds, and then a splash)

Nobuyuki:(Face up in the men's side)........

Tenchi:I guess you didn't need the hostess for that one (cracks up)

	<Tenchi in the hotsprings, take two>

Ryoko:Oh, you're so far away, why don't you come over here?

Tenchi:W-well, but I...Isn't that the women's bath over there?

Ryoko:(Standing before Tenchi, nude)Did you say something?

Tenchi:Woah, um actually, I wasn't gonna say it, but-DAMN, YOU FINE!

Ryoko:(giggles and blushes)

	<Tenchi in the hotsprings, take three>

Ryoko:Hold on to me tightly, or you'll fall! (takes off)

Tenchi:Waaaah! (eyes suddenly become fearful) Hey!  Hey, don't
let go!!

Ryoko:Whoops! 

Tenchi:Aieeeee!! (falls to the men's onsen)

Ryoko:.....sigh.....cut....

	<Tenchi in the hotsprings, take four>

Ryoko:(pulls off Aeka's towel)

Aeka:What did you do that for? (Stands there, clad in another
towel)

Director:Aeka, what ARE you doing?

Aeka:Well, I thought the script called for something a little
less lurid, especially from me, so I made a little change on my
copy.

Ryoko:(yanks off that towel)

Aeka:(Nude)Bitch! (Slaps Ryoko)

Tenchi:......(Stares at the two naked women fighting.  His towel
falls off, his hands at his sides)  Waaaugh!  (Ducks underwater)

Sasami:(Traumatized).........

Ryoko and Aeka:(Dash for Tenchi)All you alright, Tenchi?  Let me
help you! (start slapping each other again.)

Tenchi:(Tries to tie on his towel)It won't fit!

Director:What do you mean?  It was made to fit your waist size 
perfectly!

Tenchi:(blushes furiously, and resumes previous efforts to put on
his towel, not daring to look up)

Director:Oh.....CUT!

Ryoko:(grabs Tenchi, runs like a madwoman with Aeka in close pursuit)

Aeka:Come back here, you thief!!!

Sasami:(Falls to ground, unconscious)

	<Tenchi at the hotsprings, take five>

Ryoko:Aieee!! (dodges the demon she created as it strikes at her)

Demon:Roauuuhghh...SCREEK!! (Demon's movement shudders to a halt, 
and several loud mechanical screeching noises are heard)

Director:CUT!  Get the mechanic in here!  And have him waterproof it
this time!!

Ryoko:(cracks up)

	<Tenchi at the hotsprings, take six>

Tenchi:(calls up Tenchi-ken)Wow!  Neat special effects!
(breathes heavily)Luuuke!  Come to the Dark Side!(Swings the sword
around)

Director:Tenchi, quit foolin' around!!  Baka!

	<Tenchi at the hotsprings, take six>

Mihoshi:(falls from the sky)

Tenchi:(goes to catch her like normal, only his face gets buried
in her breasts)MMMFFFFF!!!  AH CAN'T BREAHVE!

Mihoshi:(slaps Tenchi)Pervert!  Release me at once!

Tenchi:ow...

Mihoshi:Geez, I'm sorry (cracks up)

	<Tenchi at the hotsprings, take seven>

Mihoshi:Distance is six...inches?  Is this..?

Sasami:(Still obviously shaken up)This is Ryo-Ohki, cute little
fella, huh?

Ryo-Ohki:Miyaa!!  (takes bite out of gun)

Mihoshi:(Stands up, hands on hips)  You little jerk!  This cost me
5,000,000 yen!!  I oughta slap you!  Look at this!  Tooth marks!!
You are going to see my lawyer, little creep!

Ryo-Ohki:(Stands on hind legs)You better bring a team of lawyers,
sister!  I've got the best in Tokyo, and witnesses, and video evidence
of you putting that gun to my face!!  Self defense, I say!!

Director:Will you two knock it off!!  GEEZ!

	<Scene with Soja in the distance, take one>

Sasami:What's that?  (Soja wobbles, then falls, and Sasami catches
it)

Director:Give it to Jim, in the effects department, with my FOOT
UP HIS @$$!!  He can't get anything right!

Sasami:Waaah!!(runs off crying)

Aeka:(slaps the director in the back of the head)Idiot!  Now look
what you did!!

Tenchi:Yeah!

Ryoko:That's right!  (All jump at director, camera goes static)
