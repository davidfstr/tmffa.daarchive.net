Chorus: Washu

Mihoushi gonna make me lose my mind
up in HERE, up in here
Mihoushi gonna make me go all out
up in here, up in here
Mihoushi gonna make me act a FOOL
up in HERE, up in here
Mihoushi gonna make me lose my cool
up in here, up in here

[Washu]
If I gotsta explain it to you babys then it's gonna be quick, aight
All you do is piss me off teaching you, ya better learn quick
and all them other things ya question me with, why dont ya just quit

Why the fuck you gonna cross the robot with your mind ditz?  Aight
There go the arm click, panic and run shit
All over that dumb shit, ain't that some shit
That mihoushi makes me wanna pull a spiked club, cause everytime
she come around, she like (what?) she's just so dumb
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
but I'm not her, aight Mihoushi?  So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, knocked out thinking you someone else
and we all thought you loved yourself
But you could've missed the issue, or maybe
your just sayin that, now cause we hate you
Shit Ryoko pushed you then we all dissed you
And you layin on your back, lookin at the roof of the shrine
Kione tellin the truth and it's about time

Chorus

[Washu]
Pissed off, I beat her with chain I leave her soft in the brain
cause Mihoushi still want the last of the rice, good lord, thats already
twice
First of all, you already ate enough
to be bugging me duplicate more, yeah right you ain't had enough
So stop whatever it is your stuffin in yo face, that got you thinking that
you Super-hungry
I got the Ex-lax, should I slip them in her drink and watch the pain
You are just Mihoushi, not even a good detective
What's gonna' be?  Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You stupid, you're retarded, your really slow
You're broke, Tenchi ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your Grandpa say you stupid, you be like, "Huh?
I love my friend Kione, I never let her go"
I'm tired of that weak ass blond whinin over nuttin
when she dont even know whats goin on, shit, she hittin the bong?
She messes it up for real kawaii scientists like my meself and I
who keeps goin on, why in the world doesn't that blonde, Die!!

Chorus

I bash out her brains so much it dent the head
No more talkin - put her to sleep instead
You keep wailing -  yall gonna end up with lead
Cause if I end up fed up, y'all is gonna be dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
all the cookies ran out, then we caught her
and we cant belive your his grand-daughter
The bigger the fuss, the more remarks we brought out
When you run up in here, e'rybody fall come out, nobody can run out
Sun rise in to sun down, I'ma keep the bat out
Mihoushi runnin her mouth? knock her lights out
Listen, yo' about to crash
You know who gonna get you? the foot up yall ass
Grandpa wishin your soul's at rest
but you never gon be dead, not even with hole in your head

Chorus

All my cannons are locked on her head
locked on her head,locked on her head
All my lasers are locked on her head
locked on her head, locked on her head
all my phazers are locked on her head
locked on her head, locked on her head
All my warheads are locked on her head
locked on her head, locked on her head
Double blast keep it comin, ain't nuttin that blond can..
Ain't nuttin that blonde can do, now.. {*MWA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*}
*click* *BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM*
*NOOOOOOO!!!*
