I CAN SEE IT NOW:
	Azusa sends for all of Tenchi's family and friends to come to
Jurai.  The usual group (Minus Yosho because he will not return to Jurai)
is waiting in a large room awaiting the emporer.
	Sasami is playing with Ryo-Ohki as per usual.  Ayeka says
something like:

AYEKA:	I wonder what father want wih us?  I wonder... could it be... oh!?

RYOKO:	Hmmm ?

AY:	Could it be..  that father wants... wants me to.. and Tenchi?

RY:	You mean that you think your old man brought us al the way
here so he could give you to Tenchi?  No way!

AY:	Well, Lord Tenchi and I have gotten quite close over the past
year...

RY:	HEY!!  He's known me longer than he knew you!

AY:	True, but he isn't constantly running away from me.. ^_^  Besides,
you really DON'T know what went on in that cabin, do you?

RY:	GRRRR!!!!

[Fighting commences in the background]
SASAMI:	Come on, Ryo-Ohki.  Let's go to the garden..

[Sasami and Ryo-Ohki leave]
[A royal guard enters the room]

GUARD:	 His majesty has asked that his daughter and company join him in
the assembly hall...  errr...
[Guard looks at Ryoko and Ayeka wrestling on the floor]


[[In the Assembly Hall]]

AZUSA:	Ah, Tenchi.  So very good to meet you again.  And Ayeka, my lovely
daughter.  How has Yosho been treating you on Earth?  You seem well.

AYEKA:	Oh, why yes, very.

RYOKO:	Hiya, Pops!
[Slaps Asuza on back]
RY:	Great to be back with the 'ol family, eh?

[Azusa glares for a moment, then moves on ^_^;; ]
[Ryoko looks dumbfounded as Ayeka nudges her with an evil grin]

MIHOSHI:  Oh!  I am so glad to meet you.  Imagine, me and the emporer of
Jurai!  Ooh!
[Azusa accepts her hand and shakes it veeeery carefully ^_^;]

AZ:	Professor Hakubi.  It is alwasys a pleasure for you to visit
Jurai.

WASHU:	And a pleasent stay it always is!  But to what may we bestow the
honor of this trip?
[did anybody else just hear a loud sucking sound? -_-;;]

AZ:	Ahh.  As you all know, Tenchi is to be the heir of the throne
after I am gone.  He has proven himself worthy many times over, but there
is one last accomplishment that he is yet to attain.

[Ayeka, Washu, Ryoko, and Mihoshi look on with inreased interest]

AZ:	Tenchi must be wed to a worthy bride.

[The girl's eyes begin shimmering with anticipation...]
[Ryoko can finally fulfil her dreams of being with Tenchi!]
[Ayeka can marry a truly genile prince!]
[Washu can love a man who will return her affection!]
[and Mihoshi will marry the man of her destiny!]

AZ:	...and you all have been very close to him.  It is tradition for
the emporer to have two wives, one arranged and the other from the heart.
And so...  I choose...
[Azusa points a finger at Tenchi]
for Tenchi's first lady...
[the finger slowly sweeps down the line of gidy women to an empty spot at
the end]

EEeehhh?!?!

AZ:	Ah!  She isn't here!  ^_^;;;;;;


=====Finis-----> ...until next time when we hear Ryoko say..
"What the hell do you MEAN Sasami?!?"  ...so long!
