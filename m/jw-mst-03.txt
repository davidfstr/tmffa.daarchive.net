The fic shown here is (c) 2000 by Keener.

(Opening)
In the not-too-distant future
Somewhere in time and space
Erik Burlison and his stranded pals
Were caught in an endless chase

Pursued by a woman named Celina
An evil b***h who wants to rule the world
She threw a few things in her purse
And in her rocket ship she hunts them all across the universe
(I'll...get...you!!!!)

I'll send him cheesy fanfics
The worst I can find
He'll have to sit and read them all
And I'll monitor his mind

Now keep in mind Erik can't control
where the fanfics begin or end
He traded in that special right
To get his stranded friends
(Passenger Roll Call!!)
Delano! (Pan left!)
Aeshana! (Cover yourself!)
Kylia! (What a cool gal.)
Danieeeeeeella! (That's one 'e'!)

If you're wondering how Erik eats and breathes
And other science facts
Just repeat to yourself 'It's just a show; I should really just relax'
And watch Mystery Fanfic Theater 3000!

(Camera backs through that tunnel)

DANIELLA (A young girl, with an unusual blond hairdo, big blue eyes, and she's 
Erik's daughter.):  "Why does today feel different?"
KYLIA (A tall 28-year-old woman with long red hair, green eyes, and wearing her 
Red Tiger Battalion armor): "Because today, we're due for our next experiment."
DANIELLA:	"What will that crazy go-kart team do in this next fic?"
KYLIA:	"I think the author said that it would be a 'ghost report'."
DANIELLA:	"Maybe they'll all get possessed and die."
KYLIA:	"No, otherwise they wouldn't have done #4."
ERIK (A 34-year-old, 6'5", solidly built man, long black hair, green eye/patch 
over left eye, almost threatening in appearance walking in):  "Hello everyone 
and welcome to the Satellite of Love."
KYLIA:	"Heey, Erik!!!"
ERIK:		"Hold on, Kylia seems unusually enthusiastic about something."
KYLIA:	"It's not much, but it seems different today."
AESHANA (A 17-year-old lady, with long teal hair, blue eyes, entering):	"No, 
it's the same as it'll always be, everyone." (takes out a picture of Leonid) 
"Soon enough, Leonid, I'll be back with you."
DANIELLA:	"Aeshana's right, Look, Dead Ringer, Inc. is calling."
ERIK:	(Pushes the red button)
--
CELINA:	"Ah, Mr. Burlison, you've familiarized yourself with Crapola Karts. 
That crazy party-hardy go-kart team."
--
KYLIA:	"Yeah, we are familiar."
--
CELINA:	"Well, more on that in a little bit.  But now it's time for this 
week's Invention Exchange!"
--
ERIK:	"Funny you bring that up.  I have something this time.  Let's start the  
presentation."
DANIELLA:	(sets an object on the table, it's covered by a sheet)
KYLIA:	"It's......"
ERIK:	(Pulls the sheet off) "The Loose Change Draw Scope!"
DANIELLA:	(Mimics fanfare)
--
CELINA:	"Draw Scope?"
--
ERIK:	"See, it's an easy way to pick up a little extra money when you're in any 
place.  Simply push the button marked 'Draw Coins', and any coins within the 
room will be attracted to the machine!" (pushes the button)
(A huge pile of pennies along with some nickels, dimes, and quarters forms in 
front of the machine.)
KYLIA:	"It really works!"
ERIK:	"I really need to start watching what I drop around here."
DANIELLA:	"Try it in a store or a movie theater!"
ERIK:	"And with some fine tuning, you can make it attract paper money from long  
range!" (turns a knob and pushes the button)
--
BIRNAM:	"Something doesn't feel right..." (Suddenly his pants are ripped off 
by an invisible force, and the pants get stuck to the ceiling, pinned by his 
wallet)
--
ERIK:	"...Maybe a bit too much range..."
DANIELLA:	"Looks like a Juicy Fruit commercial."
--
CELINA:	"Anyway, I would have an invention, but I had to spend some extra 
time preparing for this week's experiment."
--
KYLIA:	"Is it Crapola Karts No. 2?"
--
CELINA:	"Not this time.  Rather, first, let me send for your 'managers'.  
Come in!"
???? (A young man, about 19 years old, thin build, dark hairdo similar to Albert 
from Legend of  
Dragoon):	"I'm ready."
???? (An attractive 26-year-old woman with long black hair, green eyes):
	"Same here.  Beam us up, Scottie."
CELINA:	"It's Celina.  Anyway, stand by." (Pushes some buttons.)
--
(Knocking is heard)
DANIELLA:	"Someone's at the airlock."
KYLIA:	"I'll get it." (leaves the room)
ERIK:	"Why is she sending us guests?  More guinea pigs?"
KYLIA (comes back with the two guests):	"I'm back."
???? (F):	"We made it.  Anyway, let us introduce ourselves..."
???? (M):	"I'm First Draconan, Comedically Fanfictional Master Kartman."
ALL (Thinking):	"Self absorbed $^#*$^*^@*&"
???? (F):	"And I am 'Hot & Sexy Head Trip' Olivia Dubrey."
ERIK:	"Did you make that up?"
OLIVIA:	"No, Al Snow did."
KARTMAN:	"Now they'll tell us why they sent me and Olivia up here."
KYLIA:	"...'Hot and sexy head trip.....' Did you make that up?"
ERIK:	"It's...Kartman........."
DANIELLA (bowing before Kartman):	"We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!!"
KYLIA:	"Stop that, Daniella!"
KARTMAN:	(...pretty psychotic...whatta gimmick...)
--
CELINA:	"Your experiment this week is what its author calls a 'Lemon'.  What 
that is, I don't know, but Kartman and Olivia claim to...so they are there to 
walk you through it.  Anyway, this (quotation fingers) 'lemon fic' is called 
'Connections'.  It stars the cast of Tenchi Muyo! and you can count on feeling 
this one in the morning.  Send 'em the fic, Birnam."
BIRNAM:	"Can you help me find my pants first?"
CELINA:	"No, send 'em the fic!!"
BIRNAM:	"Alright, meanie." (flips the lever)
--
KARTMAN:	"Hey, Erik, how much for that draw scope you plugged?"
(Alarm sounds)
ERIK:	"Fanfic sign!!"
DANIELLA:	"A squeeze of lemon will make anything right!!"
OLIVIA/KARTMAN:	(Anime sweatdrop)
(All five of them stumble into the theater)
>By Keener <otakunxs@bellsouth.net>  
KARTMAN:	"Hey, my 12th grade physics teacher!" (Salute to ya, Kiefer!)
OLIVIA:	"First rule of these kinds of fics: Try not to address the typos."
>    Here it is, straight from the Parrot King to you.  
OLIVIA:	"Can I take a rain check on that?"
ERIK:		"We must bow before him."
KYLIA:	"Keener want a cracker!?"
>Believe me, just when you think you know what's going on, you haven't gotten to 
the end
>yet ^_-  
OLIVIA:  "Translation:  'This fic has more plot holes than we care to count.'"
DANIELLA:	"Thank you for preparing us."
>Please read and enjoy, the lemon is just flavoring and easily ignored and the 
story begins and ends.  
KARTMAN:	"Maybe that'll be true this time!"
OLIVIA:	"Fat chance."
>MST, C&C, anything is welcome and encouraged.  
KYLIA:		"So this author is into Fic & M!"
KARTMAN:	"See, it's no fun when they want you to do it!"
ERIK:		"It's no fun anyway."
>Please, give generously...
KYLIA:	"To the United Way!"
KARTMAN:	"To the Internal Revenue Service!"
>Disclaimer:  
OLIVIA:	"This is to remind us that the cast in the fic is totally out of 
character with the real cast and that the cast belongs to its original 
creators."  
>Tenchi Muyo belongs first to it's orginal creators,  
OLIVIA:	"See?"
>all twenty thousand of them, secondly to AIC and finally to Pioneer. Please
>worship any and all of them at the temple of your choice.
ERIK:		"One temple soon to open near you!"
>OtakuNXS presents...
KARTMAN:	"Otaku in excess!"
OLIVIA:	"This guy is excess otaku."
>                                    Connections
>
>  So empty, so alone, yet he was there, filling up the void with his
>presence, or reminding you how vast the darkness really was.  
KYLIA:	"Or just standing in some guy's way."
>His handsome face was full of smiles,  
OLIVIA:	"Full of smiles?"
ERIK:		"Don't wanna visualize that."
>smiles that hinted, that tempted, but never confirmed. The boys eyes made you 
>panic to be caught up in them,
OLIVIA:		"His eyes!  They're sucking me in!"
>but made you beg they'd linger, just a bit more. And his voice, okay, it
>was a trifle nasal  
DANIELLA (Urkel):	"Did I do that?"
>and had a tendency to get on one's nerves, but if
>that voice could just whisper three little words, all could be forgiven.
KYLIA:		"Those words:	'I've banged pie'."
>All in all, he was the sort to melt a heart, or break it completely.
>Tenchi sneezed.
ALL:		"Ewww!  Cover your mouth!"
>    Ayeka and Ryoko sighed softly, a ceiling separating them, a world of
>differences keeping them apart, and yet still very much connected.  
ERIK:		"Via a telephone wire."
>The space pirate yawned drowsily,  
DANIELLA:	"Ah...shouldn't have knocked off that Jurai bank last night."
>basking in the sun's warmth and letting the energy seep into her.  
OLIVIA:		"Ryoko's solar-powered!!"
>Cats may worship the moon, but it's the sunlight that whispers sweet dreams,  
KARTMAN:	"Sounds like my sleep habits."
>and today's rays spoke only of finding companionship in a dream lover's arms.
KYLIA (Sun ray):	"Find companionship in a dream lover's arms."
>    The young princess, on the other hand, was quite awake.  
KARTMAN:	"Thanks to that triple cappuccino."
>The moonlight had been gentle with her last night,  
DANIELLA:	"First night in awhile she wasn't blasted with lunar gamma 
radiation, I take it."
>and though she welcomed the power the sun brought, a silent voice in her head 
>remembered the deliciousness of his wispy embrace.  
ERIK:		"Um...what does an embrace taste like?"
KYLIA:	"Well...you...a little salty...and-"
ERIK:		"Shhh!!!!!"
KARTMAN:	"A little too much information, you guys."
>If only she hadn't awoken. He had looked at her with dark, mysterious eyes and 
>said...
KARTMAN:	"Ryoko was better."
ALL:		(Laugh)
>   "Ayeka, I've got something for you."
KARTMAN (Adam Sandler):	"My...slub-a-dub."
>   Ayeka only partially winced at the pinched voice. "And I, something
>for you, my love." she sighed, remembering.
KYLIA (Ayeka):	"These!  Take a lick of 'em!"
ERIK:		"Um, Daniella's right next to us here."
KYLIA:	"Sorry."
OLIVIA:	"How old are you, Daniella?"
DANIELLA:	"10."
OLIVIA:	"Ooh...you're gonna be f**ked up by the end of this."
>    "Um, what are you talking about? Don't you want this package?
ERIK:		"Delivered by Meiguin of Eskein!"
>Grandfather said you had been waiting for it for some time."
KYLIA:	"My Renton Lindell 2001 Beefcake Calendar!"
>    Maybe he's just got sinus problems,  
ERIK:		"He needs Dristan."
>I'm sure Washu could do something about... wait a sec.  
DANIELLA:	"She's working on another weapon of universal destruction."
>The dream Tenchi always sounded like David Sobolov, not Ned Flanders.  
KARTMAN (Flanders):	"Hidely-ho, La-daedily Ayeka!"
KYLIA (Ayeka):	"Get bent."
KARTMAN:	"Okelie-dokelie!"
>"Nevermind, Lord Tenchi, please come on in."  
DANIELLA:	"Watch out for the spill in the floor.  Mihoshi tried cooking 
again."
>She blushed slightly at the last, damn that woman for pointing out
>that strange earthen pun, now she could not keep the vulgar thoughts
ERIK:		"...Ned Flanders, vulgar?"
>from coming... arrrrggghhh!
OLIVIA:		"Ah, she's having an episode!"
>    "I could, I could come at another time, Ayeka. I'll just leave the
>package outside."
KYLIA:		"Lord Tenchi, the package is ticking!"
>    "No, now's the perfect time to...  come."  
OLIVIA:		"But we haven't even...lemonized the fic!"
>the young woman placed a hand over her forehead  
KARTMAN:	"Yup, hot.  You're staying home."
>and sighed heavily as she sat down. The blush
>burned it's way through her skin.
DANIELLA:	"Ow, ow, ow, blush, ow, hot, hot, ow!!!"
>  "Are you sure? If you don't want me to come inside I could
>always..."
ERIK:		"But you gotta pay the shipping fee!"
>    "Lord Tenchi! Get in here and give me your package already!"  
KARTMAN:	"Wow!  You're an eager one, aren't you!"
>Ayeka's face went deathly pale, her eyes wider then saucers, of the space
>faring, unidentified variety.  
KYLIA:		"Th-th-th-there's a s-spider on y-your head...Lord Tenchi!"
>Tenchi closed the door behind him and smiled nervously, holding the package as 
>if to fend off attack.
DANIELLA:	"Apparently, monsters have invaded the Masaki home."
>  "Oh, forgive me Lord Tenchi, I didn't mean to yell, I was just
>getting so frustrated and..."
OLIVIA:		"Nobuyuki plugged up the toilet again!"
>  "No-no problem, I know it's hard and all, waiting for this package I
>mean, you must have wanted it real bad."  
KARTMAN:	"Yeah, it's pretty HARD ON her-oops!"
ERIK:		"There's a screw up."
OLIVIA:		"Yeah, he kinda SPRUNG it on her-"
KYLIA:		"Zing!  Did it again!"
>The young man gave it to her,
>just like she wanted. "Ummmm, Ayeka?"
KARTMAN (Tenchi):	"Can you wait a minute?  I haven't decided my orientation 
yet."
>    "Wha...? Oh, sorry, just kind of caught up in the narrative."
DANIELLA:	"Yeah, the narrator is just so damn compelling.  It drives me to 
want to roll up in a corner and die."
>She smiled and accepted the package graciously, her hands lingering on his own  
KARTMAN:	"I'm smellin' that lemon again."
ERIK:		"Just stepped on something.  Hold on."
KYLIA:		"What is it?"
ERIK:		"Another box of Lemonheads!"
>for only a moment longer then necessary, yet not nearly as long as
>she wanted.  
KARTMAN (Tenchi):	"Sorry, Ayeka, I'm done."
>Placing the package on the table, she pulled off the wooden
>scepter attached to it and activated it with her own key.  
OLIVIA:		"As opposed to whose key?"
>The object's center jewel began to glow and the image of a beautiful woman
>appeared...
KARTMAN:	"Holographic three-way."
>    <Oh Ayeka-poo... I hope your well, momzie misses her sweatums,  
ERIK:		"Kartman, it's your mom!!!"
KARTMAN (Big sweatdrop):	"No, even she wasn't that mushy when I moved out 
after I graduated!"
>And little Sasami-chan, oh how harsh a thing that a man's loins is sharp
>enough to tear a young girl barely formed from her mother's womb.  
OLIVIA:	"Oh, my god, a Sasami Lemon!"
KARTMAN:	(Shudders)
ERIK:		"Is that what a lemon is-"
BURLISON 4:20:	"Eeew!!!  Sasami's getting banged!!"
>That a heated embrace was worth more then a motherly snuggle, that...>
KARTMAN:	"Is greater than what?"
KYLIA:	"That's doubly true, at least when it comes to my mother."
>    Ayeka sighed, while Tenchi scratched his head absently.  
DANIELLA:	"Damn head lice."
>A small bit of mental concentration and the image speed through what must have 
>been hours of prime quality, A-list flight, get your passports early, motherly 
>guilt trip.
ERIK:		"That makes it sound as if the guilt trip was overbooked."
>    <Anyway, as you requested, I have sent you some new outfits, ask and
>you shall receive sayeth the prophets, and I am the poor stone you so
>shamelessly toss first,  
OLIVIA:		"And you skipped eight times in that lake behind Tenchi's 
house!"
>right as you bleed it dry... what? Oh, Funaho
>says hi...  
KARTMAN (Funaho):	"You're in another lemon?  Sucks to be you."
OLIVIA:	"She and Luranda Tornare are just the most awesome kind of women out 
there."
KARTMAN:	"......Ah, sounds like the strong silent type...I'm not sure about 
Funaho,  
though....I think Kelvina will be in that club in 25 years."
>where was I? Oh well, anyway, I packed along Devo-chan,
KARTMAN:	"Aaah!!  Devo albums!!!  Get 'em off!  Get 'em off!"
>thought perhaps you could find some use for it, just remember to read
>the warning first,  
KYLIA:		"Listening to Devo may cause deafness and death."
>and always wait at least three days after eating before...>
KARTMAN:	"And will cause nausea and/or diarrhea."
>    The message was cut short by Ayeka's mental command, as she slowly
>opened the package.  
ERIK:		"KA-BOOM!!!!!"
>There it was, sitting atop a rather virginal white nightgown,  
OLIVIA:		"I'm starting to see where the lemon is introduced."
>somehow, the twisted length of Devo-chan's black handle made
>even that look naughty. Tentatively, she let two of her fingers brush
>it's finely polished edge,  
KARTMAN (fake hentai voice):	"Then I plunge the handle into the soft, yielding 
pocket."
>barely even disturbing the tethered vine that extended from it. But all the 
>thing needed was that most absent of touches. Ayeka froze, back arched, eye's 
>closed.
KYLIA:	"What is she doing with it anyway?"
OLIVIA:	"Do we really want to know?"
ERIK:		"..."
>    "Ayeka? Or you okay?"  
DANIELLA (Ayeka):	"Y-yeah...Stove top for dinner anyone?"
>Tenchi placed a questioning hand atop her shoulder, concern twisting his 
>visage. Then, slowly, a small smile on her lips, she turned to him.
KYLIA (Ayeka):	"No need for you now."
>    "There is no Ayeka, only ZOOL!"  
ERIK:		"Oh, great, now it's a Ghostbusters Crossover..."
>She lifted the whip from it's resting place and let it fly with easy flicks of 
>her wrist. Devo-chan snapped and lashed, cracked and thrashed.
OLIVIA:		"Get back to work, maggots!"
KARTMAN:	"A more appropriate name for this fic: 'No need for Tickle Whips."
OLIVIA:		(laughs)
>    Tenchi did the only logical thing, he screamed like a little girl,
>and fainted dead away.
DANIELLA:	"If that's what's logical, then I wouldn't want to know what isn't 
logical..."
>    "Anno?" Ryoko awoke suddenly, which considering the dream, was
>probably for the best.  
KYLIA:		"She was dreaming of Jeannie."
>Why they had to fight celestial creatures, ride around in anorexic robots and 
>take orders from Tenchi's father who just smiled evilly and videotaped 
>everything,  
ERIK:		"Giant Anorexic Fighting Robots, Caught on Tape!"
DANIELLA:	"This March on Fox!!"
>was beyond her. Of course, at least Tenchi had been there, and in that skimpy 
>little outfit too, yum.
KARTMAN:	"Tenchi poses for Mappelthorpe!"
>But how the boy had managed to sound even MORE annoying perplexed the
>young woman.
DANIELLA:	"Tight-binding underwear."
>    She stretched, scratched her backside and began phasing through the
>roof. Ah well, just a dream, and not worth any undue worry, certainly
>not a fic.  
OLIVIA:	"Kinda like this one!"
KARTMAN:	"Ouch."
>After phasing through the fourth wall, the cyan haired female
>paused halfway through the ceiling. A voice having stopped her cold.
>Damn, Ayeka's room,  
KYLIA:	"Nobuyuki, quit trying on Ayeka's fine washables!"
DANIELLA:	"Aw, yuck!"
>oh well, might as well keep going if I'm out this
>far. Wait a sec, she sounds a bit... odd.
DANIELLA:	"Helium balloons."
OLIVIA:	"Ayeka's voice would become ultrasonic if she inhaled helium."
>    "Beg you worthless dog, beg for the right to speak my name! The name
>that whisper's it's way to the dark side of your heart. The name of your
>mistress! "
ALL:		( ? )
>    Yep, she'd never let a participle dangle like that.  
KARTMAN:	"She left mine to still be dangling."
OLIVIA:	(laughing out loud)
>Wait a sec, mistress? Spiky hair and slitted eyes pulled it's way through the
>ceiling and bare feet hit the floor. She surveyed the scene before her.
>Ayeka was whipping HER Tenchi,  
KARTMAN (Tenchi):  "Thank you, ma'am, may I have another?"  
OLIVIA:	(makes a cracking noise)
KARTMAN:  "Thank you, ma'am, may I have another?"  
OLIVIA:	(makes a cracking noise)
KARTMAN:  "Thank you, ma'am, may I have another?"  
OLIVIA:	(makes a cracking noise)
>and doing a good job of it too. Not a single mark marred his body, and his face 
>held more fear then actual sting.  
KYLIA:	"Anyone else think that Ayeka's really outta character...say 'aye'."
ALL:		"Aye."
>The princess had even managed to tie the boy to get his shirt
>off, the shredded remains of which littered the floor.
ERIK:		"She must have had Mayuka use the Purple Claw Attack."
>    Ayeka turned from her captive and smiled wickedly at her rival. "Ah,
>someone else wishes to feel the tip of my whip.  
KARTMAN:	"Remember, the angle of his dangle is acutely proportional to the 
heat of her beat."
>Come then wild child, let's see what you've got." with a snap, the blank 
>tendrils of the whip tore Ryoko's outfit open, spilling her ample bosom for the 
>world to see.
ERIK (PA Voice):	"Ample Bosom Spill in Aisle 4, send cleanup crew."
>    Snarling, Ryoko stepped forward proudly. "About a good size or two
>more then you."
KYLIA:	"And certainly three steps more than Skye Mawhinney...!  All that 
Colt 45 stunted her growth."
OLIVIA:	"...42D...42D..."
>Ayeka considered this as Tenchi simply slumped forward,
>nose bleeding, brain on standby.
KARTMAN:	"Wow, a gusher!"
>    "Humph, anything more then can fit in a wineglass is unnecsecary,
>besides, they make wonderful targets."
DANIELLA:	"...Should I be reading this?"
ERIK:	"Normally, I would send you out of the room, but it's not like we have a 
choice here."		
> grinning maniacally, she sent another strike toward her newest playmate.  
KYLIA:	"Hugh Hefner is calling, he's missing a playmate."
>A called shot, straight for the nipple, left breast.
>
>    It never even got to cleavage level,  
OLIVIA:	"I don't imagine how she could miss..."
KARTMAN:	"Ray Charles could score a direct hit."
>Ryoko smiled wickedly, the whip held tight in her right arm. "Are you really 
>the best Uranus.... I mean Jurai can produce?"
ERIK:		"......Uranus..."
>    "Ho-how did you do that?"
OLIVIA (Ryoko):	"Simple, see how I catch the whip as you swing it at me."
>    Ryoko was seething. How long had this been going on? Her heart ached
>and her face burned, how long had they been laughing at her? Friendly
>smiles seemed to turn to malicious grins... or worse, pity. The
>emptiness inside of her seemed to gnaw away at her very being, the
>thirst coming to a head, like a man slowly watching a mirage fade before
>him. All she could think about, was the need to fill the void.
KYLIA:		"God, now he's trying to be artistic."
>    With a snap, she sent Ayeka flying towards her. "Get OVER here!"  
KARTMAN:	"It's Scorpion!!"
>She turned to Tenchi who had regained the ability to string words into
>sentences.  
ERIK (Tenchi):	"Ayeka......is...sexually harassing...me..."
DANIELLA:	"Dad, what is sexual assment?"
>He smiled that cruel smile he always wore, the one that said
>yes, when his lips said no.
OLIVIA:	"Silent Oral Disagreement."
>    "Umm, thanks Ryoko. Gee, I'd have never thought of you as being the
>voice of reason but I guess I misjudged you." Had the gag not been in
>place, Ryoko might just have heard him.
KYLIA:	"So, basically he sounded like...'mffmfphmmmffmfmfphmmffff'."
>    Ryoko looked to the noble, and placed a finger on her exposed chest.
KARTMAN (E.T.):	"I'll...be...right...here."
>Suddenly, the princess was incorporeal, and airborne once more, flying
>towards Tenchi,  
KYLIA:	"Unidentified Flying Ayeka!"
>her clothes hovering in mid air, where the she had
>phased through them. As she hit the ground, Devo-chan skittered to the
>side,  
KARTMAN:	"Even the whip is trying to get out of the fic!"
>Ayeka shook her head and frantically looked about, as if just
>awakening from a nightmare, and scanning the room for shadows that
>might have escaped her dreams. Then she noticed the unclothed chest of
>lord Tenchi behind her,  
DANIELLA:	"And she couldn't help but laugh."
>the young girls back barely touching his front.
>A small trickle of blood escaped her nasal cavity.
ERIK:	"What is it with every author and this thing with making someone's nose 
bleed when they get excited!!?"
OLIVIA:	"I don't know, but Kartman doesn't do it."
ERIK:		"He writes lemons?"
OLIVIA:	"Well, one, and he hasn't finished it yet."
KARTMAN:	"It's true."
OLIVIA:	"In fact, Erik, it stars you and Kylia."
ERIK & KYLIA:	"You dirty little bas-"
OLIVIA:	"I got an early look at it, and it's nowhere near as bad as some of 
these lemons out here.  In fact, I was a little turned on by it."
KARTMAN:	"You were?"
OLIVIA:	"You know when I talked to you in that one voice and rubbed up 
against you?  That was the closest I came to giving you a little...you know, a 
LITTLE."
KARTMAN:	(sweatdrop)
>    Holding her nose, Ayeka yelled out, "Wha-what's going on here?
>Ryoko, what's the meaning of this? Give me my clothes this instant!"
KYLIA:	"Imagine her with a nasal voice."
>    Ryoko sighed heavily, her rival and her would be lover WERE
>connected, she was even beginning to sound like him. Quietly, wiping an
>errant tear from her left eye, she approached the both of them. Her eyes
>were as silent as her voice, pain and desire congealing  
KARTMAN:	"Like the leftover bacon from that morning."
OLIVIA:	"Ooh!"
>into a simple need that radiated from her body, quieting even Ayeka's wrath.  
DANIELLA:	"It's amazing!  She even managed to calm down Ayeka!!!"
>Then she looked at the both of them, and split. One lonely young woman became
>two, her close fell in a pile between the twin forms.
KARTMAN:	"She's half the action in this four way."
>    The first Ryoko lifted Tenchi from his position on the ground, she
>wrapped a leg around his own and forced him against her own flesh.  
KYLIA:	"Sandwich!"
>One hand softly caressing his cheek while another played about his spiky
>hair.  
ERIK:		"Tenchi has spiky hair now?"
"I-I'm not saying you have to love me... yet."
OLIVIA (Ryoko):	"I'm too horny right now to care."
> she blushed slightly, painfully aware how she sounded. It was she was a young 
>girl with her first crush, fragile and unknowing, but then, that's exactly
>what she was.  
KARTMAN:	"The new film, 'Ryoko Comes to Terms of Endearment'."
>"I never even knew what that word meant until I meet you.
>I just... I just want to be a part of you,  
KYLIA (Ryoko):	"Actually, could I just borrow your part?"
>for at least one night.  That's not to much to ask is it? Let me be one with 
>you, we can work on love, together."
DANIELLA:	"Well, you're two right now, aren't you?  Merge, you knuckleknob!"
>    She pirouetted with Tenchi,  
ERIK:		"Now they're doing ballet?"
>turning his body incorporeal as she did,
>his clothes and the gag falling to the floor. "Ryoko, I..."
KARTMAN:	"Just suffocated and died."
OLIVIA:		"Thus ending this fic."
> The space pirate didn't dare let him finish. Maybe he would say yes, but she
>couldn't dare let it be no, not tonight.  
OLIVIA:		"Shut up and do me!"
>The hand on his chin suddenly
>pulled down, and she placed her lips over his own, her tongue invading
>his mouth.  
ERIK:		"Send in backup, reinforcements, the Tongue is invading again!"
>She never gave him a chance to protest as she seemingly tried
>to swallow him.  
KARTMAN:	"...Why am I thinking of the Bobbits?"
>Lips worked with just enough force not to crush the
>boy's human body, but defiantly enough to feel like he was being eaten
>alive.  
OLIVIA (Ryoko/Homer Simpson):	"Mmm...Jurian Prince..."
>To her, the boy was food, was drink, was the sweetest of air, in
>fact, he was life itself and she couldn't get enough.
KYLIA:		"She's addicted."
>    Ayeka face went from a ghastly pale, to a blushing pink, and finally
>to a vengeful red. "What are you DOING?" she screamed, approaching the
>pair, she never noticed the second Ryoko behind her, as the clone pulled
>her the tips of her fingers from her mouth, a small trail of saliva
>following them through the air, over her target's shoulders from behind
>and right atop the noble woman's nipples.  
ERIK:		"Warning...this fic may cause blindness and death."
OLIVIA:		"And permanent winky retreat in males."
>The girl suddenly stood ramrod,  
DANIELLA:	"..."
KYLIA:	"Isn't that an...alternative...lifestyle bar?"
>unable to move as the one time demoness slowly turned her back
>around.
>
>    "If you and him are already one, then I can't love him, without you.
>I-I do care for you, but I'm not ready to call you sister.  
KARTMAN:	"Not only am I not turned on, now I'm confused."
>Lover will have to suffice." With that, she cupped one breast completely and 
>let the other fill her mouth.  
OLIVIA:	"I have a fic idea, 'No need for Fanboys'."
KARTMAN:	"Hey!  That just might work!" (starts taking notes on his Rolodex.)
>Ayeka was right, they were the perfect size,
>completely fitting inside her mouth as she suckled with a ferocity that
>matched her counterparts movements toward Tenchi.
KARTMAN:	"Olivia...Maybe the author never intended us to read this part of 
the fic."
OLIVIA:	"Keep going..."
KARTMAN:	"He was probably expecting we'd be necking by now, so, Olivia, hmm?" 
(puckers up)
OLIVIA:	"...Maybe later, this fic is bothering me."
>    Finally, Ryoko broke the oral embrace, and let the boy gather huge
>gasps of air, trying to refill lungs that had long since reached empty.
KYLIA:	"Imagine explaining that to the police."
>She smiled motherly at him as he looked at her with confused eyes, a
>million questions, all being answered by a single kiss. Well, if his
>eye's were clueless, other parts of the boy knew quite well what was
>happening,  
ERIK:		"And they're scared stiff."
ALL:		(laughing out loud)
>and puberty marshaled it's efforts for the battle at hand.
>The wayward tip brushed against the young girl as it made it's way up.
KARTMAN:	"Wayward Q-tip?"
OLIVIA:	(whispers in Kartman's ear)
KARTMAN:	"Whoa!!  (As Tenchi, singing) Carry on, my wayward tip..."
>    Smiling, she let her body go intangible again, giving it all the
>room it needed to reach maximum potential.  
KYLIA:	"Maximum arc potential, maximum gravitational potential?"
KARTMAN:	"More like maximum nausea potential."
>Then, after one more smoldering stare in the young man's eyes, freezing him 
>faster then any headlights could,  
DANIELLA:	"She mistook him for a deer and plowed over him.  The end."
>she levitated slightly, wrapped both lower limbs
>around his backside, locking them into position with her feet, and then
>she let herself slide down.
>
>    Tenchi swallowed hard, closed his eyes, and felt... nothing.
KARTMAN:	"The Amazing Intergalactic Quickie!"
>Granted, the actual feel of Ryoko wrapped around his body, skin touching
>in a glomp
KYLIA:		"Where does this word 'glomp' come from?"
>he had known so well, but never like this, was beyond his
>wildest dreams. But down below, he knew something was amiss. He looked
>to his companion questioningly, only to find her own eyes shut,
>seemingly lost in concentration. Then, slowly, gradually, he felt her
>walls closing in on him, a silken palace that seemed to quiver by his
>very touch.
OLIVIA:		"The most romantic scene in the entire fic."
>    Ryoko was no fool, she knew her strength could turn her lower body
>into a guillotine of sorts. A sexual orgasm ending in the world's single
>most overzealous circumcision.  
ERIK:		"Hey, now Tenchi's Jewish!"
KYLIA:	"Hello!"
KARTMAN:	"Talk about a grip!"
>It took every bit of her will and concentration to gradually cup and hold his 
>member, rather then biting and swallowing.  
OLIVIA:	"Now she's Monica Lewinsky!"
>She was rewarded as he enlarged again, and began to take
>the lead in their dance, filling, removing, giving, taking, again and
>again.
KARTMAN:	"Bumping, grinding, bumping, grinding, cutting the wheel to the 
left, fleeing quickly, denying everything to the insurance guys."
>    Washu barely pushed her abort switch in time. Exactly one nanogram
>of omni-matter had been required for the experiment.  
DANIELLA:	"Omni-matter?"
KARTMAN:	"Aw, I'm not feeling so good all of a sudden."
>The one full gram
>she had dumped in instead had been enough to eradicate your average star
>system. Still, the explosion had been consigned to subspace, and the
>greatest scientific genius in the universe had all the time in the world
>to beat the ever-loving hell out of the one who had caused the mistake.
KARTMAN:	"Now I'm even more confused."
>But this time, there was no blonde haired, melodic voice to skirt the
>very edges of the red head's sanity.  
OLIVIA:	"Ah, now back to normalcy.  Mihoshi gets punked out."
>No, this was problems from a
>different source, something from within.
DANIELLA:	"Washu, you look constipated."
KYLIA (Washu):	"Here we go!"
>    Another spasm shook her miniature frame.  
ERIK:		"Don't tell me she and Ryoko have that E.T. connection thing going."
KYLIA:	"You mean like when E.T. got drunk and then Elliot got sent home?"
OLIVIA:		"Wait a minute, the title makes sense then!"
>From the feel of things,
>the source was about eight inches within.  
KARTMAN:	"Eight inches?"
KYLIA:	"Tenchi's hung!"
>Slowly, she made her way to a
>lounge chair that appeared from nowhere. That was it, from now on, no
>more hormones for that young lady, she was sexually grounded!
DANIELLA:	"What's that word, Dad, that you used for RTC?  Eunuch?"
OLIVIA:	"That's right, Washu's turning Ryoko into a eunuch."
>Inside, her body quaked and shivered at another thrust. Okay, she'd at least
>wait until the girl was finished, no use spoiling the Kodak moment, the
>kind you don't dare take to those one hour developing places.
KARTMAN:	"Or even snap to begin with."
>    Idly, she outlined her form with one of her fingers, following the
>curve of her inner thigh to her...  
OLIVIA:	"KITTY!!!"
>"Washu! Can you come over here? We
>need you." The voice caused synapse to go snap, crackle and pop
DANIELLA:	"Rice Krispies!!"
> and the crab haired one sat up in fury.
KARTMAN:	"Ew!  Now she has crabs!"
>    "How many times have I told you not to come in here unless it's to
>inform me of your painful demise?"
>
>    Mihoshi placed a questioning finger to her lips and thought hard.
>"Ummmm, I dunno... how many?"
ERIK:		"At least Mihoshi's still in character."
>    Washu was about to answer when a smaller body collided with her. She
>looked down to see Sasami, tears streaming her eyes. "Washu, something's
>wrong with Ryo-Ohkie, I think she's sick."
DANIELLA (Ryo-ohki):	"Meeeyaaah!!!!"
ERIK:		"Translation: This fic is giving me fits!"
>    After letting another spasm take it's course, she looked down at the
>offered animal. It meowed in a most peculiarly satisfied manner,  
OLIVIA:	"Now we have to read about cabbits getting banged telepathically!!?  
What was the author on when he wrote this?"
KARTMAN:	"Certainly not Mountain Dew and Tabasco Sauce like me."
>and it's eyes closed as if waiting for something. Washu sighed, "There's
>nothing wrong with her that a cigarette won't fix, just hand her to me.
>She'll be all right."
KYLIA:	"Yeah, a cigar would be too much."
ERIK:		"Can't argue there now can-Kylia!"
>    "Cabbits smoke?" Mihoshi asked quistivily, picturing a more humanoid
>Ryo-Ohkie, in a tux with dark glasses and a cigarette in her mouth.
KARTMAN (British accent):	"My name is Ohki...Ryo-ohki."   
>  "Depends on the friction ratio," Washu sighed, picking the sometimes
>battleship up and walking toward the sofa. She almost got there before
>the another flash of raw pleasure put her on her knees and Ryo-Ohkie
>squirming.
OLIVIA (Washu):	"Hey Tenchi, Ryoko...Quit f**king each other, would you?"
>    Suddenly, Ryoko two pushed Ayeka back to back with Tenchi. "I think
>that's enough data gathering. Size, texture, yep, all the dimensions
>should be in proportion."  
KARTMAN:	"Hey, Ryoko, analyze this!!!" ('Salutes' the fic)
>The young noble looked at her like she was
>insane, not understanding anything.
ERIK:		"Well, we wouldn't understand it either."
>    "Wha-what are you babbling about, let him go." she squeaked,
>something about the way Ryoko was approaching her stealing all the
>strength in her voice.
>
>    "To be a part of him, I have to be a part of you, therefore, we've
>gotta learn to connect.  

OLIVIA:	"The problem being yours is a serial port, and mine is fit for a 
Firewire connection."
>Luckily, I can change my form a bit, and I've
>got all the research I need done."
KARTMAN:	"Good.  Maybe this fic is nearly over."
>    Ayeka's eyes squinted in confusion, until her peripherals caught
>something from below. The growth from Ryoko was everything she said it
>was. Size, shape and feel. Frantically, she grabbed backwards, reaching
>out for Tenchi's hand. When she turned her face back to in front of her,
>the demons face was inches from her own.
ERIK (demonic voice):	"Hello, Ayeka...Do you like scary fanfics?"
>    "I won't force it if you don't want it. Tenchi told me with his
>body, but you need only speak it with you mouth. Do you want to be
>whole... or hole?"
KYLIA:	"So, Ryoko's gonna turn her into a donut?"
>    Ayeka was stunned, Ryoko's breath warming her face, her slitted eyes
>boring into her own. Suddenly, she grabbed Tenchi's hand and was
>rewarded with a squeeze. Gathering power from the grasp, she nodded
>slowly.
KARTMAN:	"......And that's supposed to...?"
>    Washu sat as still as she was able, idly petting her Cabbit and
>trying to ignore Mihosh's incessant prattle over what was wrong, and was
>she sick? Apparently the ditz had some great cold medicine.  
DANIELLA:	"There's that Dristan Tenchi needed earlier."
>The scientist sniffed,  
ERIK:		"her fingers."
>so THAT explains it.
KYLIA:		"This fic really is bad!"
> Suddenly, her body arched fully
>with a whole new sensation, Ryo-Ohkie did likewise and they both
>shuddered as the new form of pleasure worked it's way through their
>bodies.
OLIVIA (Singing):	"I wanna tele-bang, bang, bang, bang you all night long!"
>    Scanning Ryoko's mind for a full update, she got the whole picture.
>So, that's what's happening, hmmmm, not a bad idea actually. Maybe her
>daughter had inherited more then looks after all.  
KARTMAN:	"She inherited the ability to be the medium for everyone at once 
should they want Tenchi to give 'em a little...you know, a LITTLE."
>Only Mihoshi's cry
>alerted her to Sasami's plight. The young girl had her eyes closed, and
>feel to the ground, unconscious. The pair were at her side in a flash,
>Washu feeling the girls head.
OLIVIA:	"I can't tell how she is and-wait a minute, I can feel some peanuts 
in there!"
KARTMAN:	"I sure hope you said 'peanuts'."
>    "She's fine," spoke a voice of life and power, less human and more
>of wind rustling through a dark and quiet forest. "I just wasn't able to
>block it all from her. Tenchi was relatively easy, his physiology is a
>bit different, but Ayeka... I'm afraid were just all a wee bit too
>connect... oh my."
KYLIA (voice):	"I forgot what the stuff I said meant."
>    Washu couldn't agree more, as she slumped down in her seat. Tsunami
>gripped an armrest for support.  
ERIK:	"Maybe this fic will start to become more reasonable, I mean Tsunami has 
the power to fix everything, doesn't she?"
>"No, I mean, I can't hold it back, both
>the giving and the taking. I'm afraid I'm-I'm broadcasting it." Outside,
>trees shook were there was no wind, the grass danced about in time to
>the steady life rhythm and blossoms bloomed without a spring.
DANIELLA:	"We're all screwed!"
OLIVIA:		"Do you realize how funny that really was?"
DANIELLA:	"No."
OLIVIA:		"You will in about six years then."
>    The scientist called up her dimensional computer and made some
>readings. It was as if the entire ecosystem had gotten high of life, or
>the Goddess there off. No sentient creatures were affected, just plants
>and living creatures without large brain capacities.
KARTMAN:	"Yeah, you gotta be dumb enough to want to see what's going on."
> Washu turned to see
>Mihoshi shudder as the wave hit her,
KYLIA:	"You could hit Mihoshi with anything and she wouldn't know it."
> and nodded to herself, correct as
>always. Even more so, the wave was expanding, it had already circled the
>planet, and was making it's way throughout the system. Like a tidal wave
>of an orgasmic flow. Well, it was caused by a Tsunami at least.
OLIVIA:	"And they break the suspense with a cute little pun."
KARTMAN:	"So, like, Tsunami is trying to do everyone and everything on Earth, 
all at once?"
OLIVIA:	"It's a menage a......fifty-seven billion?"
>    Then the wave struck her again, doubling in intensity, and opening a
>part of her that had been submerged millenium ago. Washu crackled in
>yellow energy,
DANIELLA:	"There's the Chrono Crossover..."
KARTMAN:	"Hmm...!"
> floating atop a wave of raw power, she grew. When she
>came to rest, the full blown Goddess looked about quistivily. She
>grabbed at her new breasts,
OLIVIA:	"Th-they're...real!"
>still as firm as she had remembered them.
>But it was her mind that was truly different, suddenly she was connected
>to every star, every planet, every bit of matter and energy in the
>entire universe... and she was still plugged into the menage a trois.
KYLIA:	"Still has the time for some cheap pleasure."
>    Powered by the two Goddesses, the galaxy began to quake and roll
>with each stroke. A pumping, thumping base line that tuned itself into
>the entire universe. Suns twinkled to it, humans and aliens quivered and
>shook with it,  
ERIK:		"The Almighty Universal Orgy!"
>and mitochondria sang with the secret life song of all
>existence. Elsewhere, a goddess not on the same reality as any before
>her turned to an ethereal man and smashed him with a mallet. "Dirty old
>man."
>    "Lady Tokimi?"
KARTMAN:	"Get me out of this universe!"
>    With all three connected, the universal probing and receiving
>dripped into other worlds, other dimensions. Fic writers,  
ERIK:		"Maybe it'll sweep away this author!"
KARTMAN:	 (HUGE sweatbead)
ALL:		"Thanks!  Now we're all wet!"
>Cursed Martial
>artists, Pocket dimensions with funky names, politicians, demon gods and
>overfiends, alternative universes and animayhem decks, all thrumming and
>pumping in time.
DANIELLA:	"Or in disgust."
>    Everything was connected. Life and Death, beginings and endings...
>
>    The Multiverse came... almost as one....
OLIVIA:	"Well, if we ever really find life out there, this is a good 
argument that Bill Clinton should not be our alien ambassador."
>    "Ummm, sorry guys." Tenchi apologizzed.
KARTMAN:	"For making all of you read once again as I get raped by Ryoko."
>    The End!
ALL:		"Whoo-hoo!"
OLIVIA:	"We survived!"
KARTMAN:	"You know, though, it wasn't as bad as I thought it to be."
(They all stumble out of the theater.)
OLIVIA:	"Well, that's what a lemon is, in a nutshell."
KARTMAN:	"Yeah, but not all of them are this subtle."
OLIVIA:	"That's true."
ERIK:		"You think that Celina could warn me before sending a lemon?"
KYLIA:	"This isn't for Daniella's eyes!"
KARTMAN:	"Um, they're calling."
--
CELINA:	"So, did this one work?"
--
OLIVIA:	"Wow, that one stunk!"
KARTMAN:	"Yeah, if you send us a lemon, make sure it's a lemon."
OLIVIA:	"Yeah, that one was more lymon than anything."
KARTMAN:	"A 'Sprite' Fic."
--
CELINA:	"Yeah, I thought about that.  I picked the wrong fic.  All of you 
look like you're still  sane.  Anyway, Kartman and Ms. Dubrey, I think I'll keep 
you on at least 'til I find a good lemon for the experiment."
--
KARTMAN & OLIVIA:	"NOOOOOOO!!!!!"
KYLIA:	"Looks like you guys are screwed."
KARTMAN:	"I have to get back to my job cleaning theaters!"
OLIVIA:	"And I need to get to Minneapolis tonight!  Smackdown! is to be 
taped tomorrow!  I have a tag match with Al Snow against Perry Saturn and 
Terri!"
DANIELLA:	"There's an angle I'd like to see."
--
BIRNAM:	"I still can't find my pants!"
CELINA:	"Ah, hell, I'll just buy you more.  Push the button, Birnam."
BIRMAN:	(pushes the button)

THE END, FINALLY!!!
