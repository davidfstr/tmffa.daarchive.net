(Semi-Charmed kind of life the real song by third eye blind)
Song: This Wild kind of girl life
This song is about Tenchi going crazy over his life

I do not own any of the Tenchi characters in this song and I do not take any
credit for the song either so please dont sue me!




I'm slumped and I'm tired
I'm insane, Ryoko's living, Aeka's golden
they all live for me
Aeka says she lives for me
Ovation
Her own motivation
Ryoko comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile
like a fun full fill to you
Go some where any where else just do what you want to do
She comes over me
Keeping on a smiling grin, what she forces me to go through
One stop till Sasami's breakfeast that saved us
And speaking to Mihoshi like a chorus in reverse
Chop another line in this crazy life like a student with a curse
Come on Washu says like a freaky mad scientist she takes the stage
They all make me play these games then I say

I want something else
To get me through this
Wild kind of girl life, baby baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
TENCHI!!!!!!!!

The house was ruined I was a wreck
I was taking sips of strong tea through my nose
And I wish I could get out of here
Someplace away from here
From all the frantic police chase
Doing the Jurian power making you lift up until you break
It all wont stop
And then I bump up
They took the hint that I was giving them
Then I bumped up again, then I bumped again, I said to them

How do I get you all back where to
the place where you were all at first before I met you
How do I get myself back to my life
Then I started to say

I want something else
to get me through this
Wild kind of girl life, baby baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
TENCHI!!!!!!!

I believe in the the jurian power in my hands
The sword gives me a feeling
A great awseom feeling
I believe in the normal life I once had
And the way Kiyonie always yells at Mihoshi can make her cry
When I'm with you girls I feel like I could go insane
And that would just wont be all right, all right

When all the space ships fell
They all said they were crashing thanking me for saving they're lives
Ryoko makes my house and dad shrink
In the city that I onced lived in
I'm on the urge to stay alive
But now I'm really struggling trying to stay sane

I remember when Sasami and Aeka first came in my life with wierd dresses on
Mihoshi is driving Kiyonie up the wall again I guess
And those little red panties of Ryoko's, they passed the test
Washu appears around the lab face burnt from an experiment

One
And then Ryoko holds me
And then it hit me
Standing still now thats all I want to do is this
Just for now I guess

I dont think Mihoshi has quiet understood what I have said
Aeka is scared that I wont be hers alone, no no I wont
She's got her jaws just locked in smile
But still something is just not right

I don't want nothing else
Except this wild girl life, baby baby
I don't want nothing else I'm not listening any deals you make to trade me
GOODBYE GOODBYE GOODBYE GOODBYE!!!!!!

Now I love it with the women of this wild girl life
I started siping strong tea through my nose
And I wish that it will stay this way for along time
Always like this with Ryoko, Aeka, Sasami, Washu, Kionie, Mihoshi, and Ryoki
At this place where I use to go insane
INSANE INSANE INSANE!

I dont want nothing else.

The end
