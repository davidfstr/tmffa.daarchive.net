(Sasami) I got a boyfriend now. Ha ha ha

(Aeka) C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo

(Kyonie)Gotta man that I think I gon' love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll together (C'mon)
No matter where Tenchi goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

(Kyonie)Gotta man that I think I gon love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll together (C'mon)
No matter where Tenchi goes, I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

Yo, yo, Tenchi lookin love only for me, no doubt
Sophisticated Tenchi keeps me on guessin
Said it would be your blessing to take back with me to Juari
Callin you mine, late nights I'm watching you sleeping
And, start thinking bout all times we have been together
And, how they are less than, trying to become us to Juari's
Can't compare to the power of love we have, could have been Ryoko's
But I knew Tenchi was mine, I'll never share him, fight to the death
If I need to prove that, Wounds that you feel of my anger
Other chicks couldnt soothe it, my heart beats for only his
I'm your only love now, And I'm gonna stay lovin ya forever
All the chicks tried to get ya but those other chicks couldnt soothe that
I'm playin only with you, dates across the Tokyo sky seeing highlights
Tenchi watch me playin my part, his wif-ey, forever in his life see
Forever be us, like to power shields of the greatest Jurians
I'll tell the whole universe Tenchi Aeka dont no one else with other guys
And my papa wants me to choose but you, I'll always be keepin for myself

(Kyonie)Gotta man that I think I'm gonna love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll be together forever (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

(Kyonie)Gotta man that I think I'm gonna love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll be together forever (C'mon)
No matter where he goes I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

My parents thinkin I'm delirious
But the love I feel for Tenchi is serious
Couples of the universe dont compare to Tenchi and me
Tenchi has been through all fights but when I see it escalate
I'm the getway space ship so Tenchi can escape
Rob all the Jurian banks for the bail, Tenchi spending nights in jail
Carving our names with hearts around the cell
It may be a little insane maybe I'm stupid
But for me to leave my Tenchi now for new love would take a lifetime
So I'm keeping Tenchi forever see uh-uh
Feels like I'm in Jurian Heaven when he's making love with me down my spine
I dont need all that royalty stuff just as long as you wit me
And Ryoko if you think your compotion come and get me
My postion for Tenchi has held, Ryoko has tried but has alwayzed failed
Pretty good piece of Jurian meat sweet motherfucka, uh-uh good enough for me
Only Jurian in the family that was crazy enough to control me

(Kyonie)Gotta man that I think I'm gonna love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where goes, I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

(Kionye)Gotta man that I think I'm gonna love forever
And forever Tenchi and I we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin of him
I'm gonna love Tenchi, I'm gonna love him

I'm the chick Tenchi will never leave, gave him all his luxuries
Carry stories that can totally annoy him, still Tenchi only trustin me
Secrets never come from my mouth of Tenchi, even if Kagato tortures me
Always taught to hold my ground thats why I'll always be his Jurian Queen
It's some stuff Ryoko does to him that makes me flip off
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sad and sorry
I'll fly away for a couple days to test his loyal ground
Keep Mihoshi and Kyonie on the prowl, Controllin the ground
I'll never let Tenchi go thats way it just gonna be
Always will be his extra streghten to see him fight through the pain
Us together forever will be in our world whats his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand for the rest of our time.

Repeat Chorus Two Times.
