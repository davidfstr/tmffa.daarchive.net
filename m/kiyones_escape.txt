So... Let the game begin... Sorry, fic...

--------------------

Mihoshi looked around inside the house.
-"Kiyone...", she said annoyingly, well at least for Kiyone.
¤Oh I love my partner, she's my best friend. I wonder where's she's 
gone to.¤, she thought.
Mihoshi searched all around the house, seeing Sasami in the kitchen,
seeing Aeka and Ryoko, talking about something, and, much to Washu's
displeasure, finally went into Washu's lab and looked.
-"WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?!", Washu screamed.
-"Uhm... I'm looking for Kiyone, have you seen her?", Mihoshi asked.
-"No, you haven't.", a voice whispered to Washu.
-"No, I haven't seen her. Now will you get out of my lab?"
Mihoshi went out of the lab, whimpering:
-"Where has Kiyone gone to?!"
-"She's gone, you can come out now.", Washu said.
Kiyone crawled out from under a table.
-"Phew. Thanks Washu. Now about you sending me to another dimension...",
she started.
-"Easy, just step into that transporter over there.", Washu answered.
-"Thanks.", Kiyone said, as she entered the transporter.
Washu walked over to a control table, and started to adjust the coordinates.
¤Finally, no more Mihoshi! At last I will be free from that nightmare!¤,
Kiyone thought.
A highpitched voice broke the silence.
-"Kiyone!!!!!", Mihoshi yelled.
-"Huh?", Kiyone managed to say, before Mihoshi yelled again.
-"Where have you been!? I've looked all over the place and... Whooops!"
Mihoshi tripped, accidentaly pressing the activation button for the
transporter, before falling into the transporter herself.
¤Why me?¤, Kiyone managed to think before her body dematerialized
and was sent into another dimension.

The End
--------------------
As Henrik expressed it, "At last I'm rid of them both... Hmm, 
maybe I'll miss Kiyone..." ^^
Ok, send _ALL_ flames, requests etc. to _8thlegion_max@mail.bip.net
Henrik doesn't want any, so _don't_ try to mail him. 
I mean it, he'll delete it before he even reads it. 
I mean I saw it!
No kidding!
