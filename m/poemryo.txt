Tenchi’s Love
(Inspired By the Fanfic Aikan Muyo)
Thanks Happosai

When I first saw you my eye were to stay,
I cannot leave so I will stay,
I love you at first sight,
To stay with I’d start a good fight.

I’ll never leave from your arms,
And I’ll never do you harm,
You move so free with much grace,
When you move I look at your face.

Love at first sight that I found,
On that first night,
You blind me with your beauty,
In the in and outside.

When I say I love you,
You replied deeply with “me too”
And all the words that follow are true,
When I say the words “I love you”.

This is a poem I wrote about Ryoko this is supposed to
be recited by Tenchi to Ryoko.

Ryoko Lover

“I am lonely like the moon You are away as the earth
Now you say I light your thoughts Night after night
Soon you forget”- Ryoko “Lonely Moon”
