*********************************
On to the MST...
*********************************

The new fanfic theater has been built and is really some
sort of spaceship.

The MSTers are:

Timothy Turner: An author of MSTs and a loser.

Mark Rothlisberger: Friend of Tim's, the co-author, and also a loser.

Who will be the third MSTer?

*********************************

::For some odd reason the theater has been undergoing a lot of
changes.  The internal region of the ship has begun to change
itself due to some type of mechanisms.  The snack bar looks
more like a diner for the MSTers to eat and the rest of the
ship looks more of a grayish / white color; the true inside
color of a spaceship.  Tim enters.::

Tim:  Hello, all of you readers / watchers.  A lot of things have
happened since the last MST.  We lifted off last time and now are
in low orbit.  I have kept track of our progress on this little
monitor ::points to a monitor:: and have found that our orbit is
slowly getting higher.  We're supposed to dock with the main
ship soon.  All this slow climbing orbit stuff defies the laws
of physics, but remember that this is the anime dimension and
anything can happen.

::Mark enters.::

Mark:  Hey, hey!  There's a place down the hall!  And it's my room!

Tim:  Great!  How do you know?

Mark:  It says so on the door!  There's one for you, too!  Take a look!

Tim:  All right.  ::They go down the hall and take a look.::

Tim:  I'll be darned.  There's your room.  ::Turns around.::  And there's
mine!

Mark:  The third one has Duo's name on it, but you know we kicked him out.
Quatre isn't too happy about that.

Tim:  If I'm not mistakened, there are supposed to be 3 MSTers.  I wonder
who'll replace us?

Mark:  Beats me.

::A panel lights up and says "Call".::

Tim:  Quatre's calling us.  To the lobby / living area!

::Quatre's face appears on a 100 inch (!) big screen TV that popped out of
the floor during launch.::

Quatre:  Hello, my objects of mental torture.

Tim and Mark:  Hello, your putridness...

Quatre:  I called you here because we're about to dock with the main
ship.  I wouldn't want you to miss that!

Tim:  Joy...

Quatre:  Look out the window!

::A ship appears on the horizon above the Earth.  It has a cover over the
front part of it.::

Mark:  What's with the cover?

Quatre:  I will unveil the name of my ship to you.  That just adds to the
suspense.

Mark:  Oh...

Quatre:  And now, the unveiling of the ship's name!

::Quatre hits a button and the cover flies off the front, unveiling the
name "Winner Queen".   Tim and Mark are trying to keep their laughter
in.::

Tim and Mark:  Haha...haha!  AAAAAHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!!!!!
That is soooooo freaking FUNNY!  AAAAAAAAHHHHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!

Quatre:  WHAT THE HELL!?!?!?!??!?!!?!?  WHO SCREWED ME OVER!?!?!?!?!
THE NAME'S SUPPOSED TO BE "WINNER EXTRORDANAIRE"!!!!!  ::Irritated.::
STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!  ::Noticing Tim and Mark are continuing to laugh,
he hits a button.::  THAT OUGHT TO SHUT YOU UP!  ::Calming; anger
turning to laughter.::  Today's lemon is called "Dirty Cops"!  Now
get in there and suffer!

::The panel now reads "Bad Fanfic Alert".::

(This part is not our idea, it's Best Brains'.  So don't sue us.)

7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

******************************************

::Tim and Mark enter the theater and sit down.::

Mark:  "Winner Queen"?  Haha!  Great!

Tim:  That is so funny!

>Alrighty people its time for a decent Mihoshi/Kiyone lemon.

Tim:  Lesbo stuff isn't "normal" in any sense...  But it's fun
to watch.  ::Gets nosebleed.::  DAMMIT!

>But as  always I'll take a new twist to this =B so har har if your into 
>the regular lesbo acts.

Mark:  I'll take a new twist to this and make it suck more than the
usual fic.  HAR HAR!  =B

>Oh ya I do not own these people and

Tim:  It sucks because I can't use them as sexual toys because I don't own
them.

>this is

Mark:  Bacon!

>a mature fanfic but eh you will read it anyway!

Mark:  ::Looks at the young viewers reading the fic.::  Scram, children.
Go watch Barney or something.

Tim:  We dilute the sexual content so bad that it isn't even erotic anymore.

Mark:  With the things we say, I don't know.

>X.x

Tim:  The author died so we can go!

Both:  HOORAY!

>so lets get going!

Mark:  Crap.  The author pulled one of those Monty Python deaths on us.

Tim:  You are not going to be late for grandma's dinner, young man!

>Dirty Cops

Tim:  New on the Playboy Channel:  See cops get down and dirty!

Mark:  See them use handcuffs!

Tim:  See what the lady cops can do with their nightsticks and guns!

Mark:  Don't put women down too much...

>"No no Mihoshi, don't!

Tim:  Bad Mihoshi!  Sit!  Heel!

>I can just get it fixed!" But as always, the bumbling GP had now come
>across something that needed help.

Tim:  Her airhead needed a refill.

Mark:  She looked in the mirror and saw what REALLY needed help!

>The unlucky victim this time was Kiyones' new laptop especially
>useful for work.

Mark:  Duh!  =B

>"Don't worry Kiyone, I'm sure I can fix it!"

Tim:  (as Mihoshi)  So I can break it again!

>squealed the tanned detective

Mark:  Mihoshi needs a new set of brakes.

Tim:  Or she's turning into a huge rat.

Mark:  OR running her fingernails across a chalkboard.

>as she fooled around with more adhesives and tools in Washus'

Mark:  (as Mihoshi)  AH-HAH! The secret to Washu's success!  DUCT TAPE!

>lab, convinced in her abilities. "Now where is it? It has to be
>around somewhere"

Tim:  But little did she realize she didn't have a brain to begin
with...

>Mihoshi flicked back a strand of blonde hair and set to work.

Tim:  "What can I break this time?," thought the bubblehead.

>Now that headache grew once more in Kiyone's temple as she growled
>angrily again. 

Mark:  She's turning into a werewolf!

>"You wouldn't need to fix it if you listen to what I said."

Tim:  (as Kiyone)  Take my advice, Mihoshi!  Walk straight toward a
cliff and don't stop!

>How could Mihoshi know eating, cooking, and typing all at the same time
>couldn't be done without some tragic accident?

Mark:  Face it, she just didn't know.

Tim:  Mihoshi needs more RAM to perform all of those complex tasks at
the same time.  That's why her system crashed.

>Well hard did Mihoshi try as her partner was secluded from the lab 
>room.

>"What's she doing down there anyway?" Asked the mad genius Washu
>as she walked to Kiyone and the door,

Mark:  Which continuity is this fic?

Tim:  Hopefully it's Tenchi Universe this time.  I've had enough Shin
Tenchi Muyo for my blood.  Anyways, I bet Mihoshi is screwing up more
of Washu's inventions somewhere in that basement.

>which loud thinking was heard from within. Kiyone sighed,
>"She's trying to fix something for me

Tim:  Awwww, Mihoshi's making cake and coffee for Kiyone.

::The fic cuts off.::

Mark:  Huh?

Quatre (from the projection booth):  Hey!  I need as much power as I can
to dock and make the final connections to the main ship.  You guys are
lucky...FOR NOW!

::Tim and Mark both leave the theater.  It's dark when they leave.::

1...2...3...4...5...6...7...

******************************************

Mark:  Man, who turned off the lights?

Tim:  The only thing I can see is the sun out the window.

Mark:  At least we haven't messed up the place yet.  We'd be
tripping on our trash.

Tim:  Yeah.  I guess.  Heeeeeeey!  ::Tim lifts off the floor.
Mark does so as well.::

Mark:  What is this!?!?!?!?!

Quatre (on speakers):  Sorry!  No artificial gravity for about
2 minutes!  Just standard docking procedure!

Tim:  At least you're not throwing up, Mark.

Mark:  That would be cool.

Tim:  Not if it messed up the leather couches over there!
::Points.::

Mark:  Quatre pulled out all the stops.

::A loud boom is heard and the room shakes.::

Quatre:  Oops!  A little bad with the docking!  But not too bad!
We're connected!  ::The power comes back on.  The panel reads
"Alert".::

Tim:  What did you do, Quatre?

Quatre:  A ship is approaching.  It's the Outlaw Star!  I have a
little score to settle with Gene Starwind!

::Tim and Mark both get anime sweatdrops on the backs of their
heads.::

Mark:  Can you even take the slightest insult and let it all go?

Quatre:  NO!!!!!!

Tim:  ::Whispers to Mark.::  Must be withdrawal from the Zero System.
_______________________________________________

::On board the Outlaw Star, the full crew sees the Winner Queen on
the screen.::

Gene:  Gilliam, give me a status report on that ship.

Gilliam:  I'm sorry Gene, this ship is not registered on any database
in this galaxy sector.  It must be new.

Gene:  Do you know anyone who's been building a new ship lately?

Gilliam:  A couple of rumors have it that the Winner family heir,
Quatre, has been building a new theater ship.

Gene:  ::Sweat drop.::  Gilliam!  Turn us around!  Get us out of here,
now!

Quatre:  NO!  YOU WON'T GET AWAY!  ::Punches the accelerator.::

::The Winner Queen is quickly upon the Outlaw Star.  Quatre uses a big
tube and penetrates the hull of the Outlaw Star, sending out a digital
pulse to disable engine systems.  Quatre's minions then board the ship
via the giant tube and capture Gene.  The rest remain on the bridge
(except Melfina) are held hostage.  Gene is brought to the lobby where
both Tim and Mark are watching Quatre laugh madly.  Melfina has been
allowed to follow.::

Gene:  Quatre!  Come on!  I only said something funny about how you
and Trowa get along in Gundam Wing!  It was only a harmless joke!

Quatre:  You implied that I'm gay!

Gene:  Come on!  Let me go!  I have a date with Melfina in a couple of
hours!

Quatre:  Have a permanent date with her!  On this ship!

Gene:  ::Sweat drop.::

Mark:  Welcome to the club.  We're suffering for something WE didn't
even do!

Tim:  GENE!  GET ME A DATE WITH AISHA CLANCLAN!

::Mark mallets Tim.::

Mark:  Don't mind the loser.

Quatre:  I have a special plan for you and your friends, Gene.  I'm
gonna seal off all the airlocks so you won't escape.  And I will
permanently incorporate the Outlaw Star into the Winner Queen!
And I'm gonna seal off access between the two ships so you won't
come up with some kind of plan.

Tim:  NOO!!  Our window has ended!

Quatre:  If you look around the ship, you see I only provided on space
suit.

Mark:  ::Remembering Duo's obnoxious mouth.::  Oooh, but we used it well.

Quatre:  Now, get in the theater!  Melfina can stay out here.

Gene:  But!

Melfina:  It's okay Gene.  Just go in...

::The MSTers walk back into the theater.::

7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

******************************************

::The three sit down.  Tim in the middle, Mark on the left,
Gene on the right.::

Gene:  So, what's this fic called?

Mark:  "Dirty Cops."

Gene:  Blech...

>EVEN when I told her not to touch the laptop at all."

Gene:  Today's opposite day...

>"Well I suppose it must be serious, what with that dumb blonde
>not even paying attention to the sign,"

Tim:  The signs of the times have all come true!  Repent, dumb,
blonde woman!  You are EVIL!

Gene:  (as driving instructor)  Mihoshi!  Pay attention to the
stop sign!  AAAAUUUUHHHHHHH!!!!!!

>Kiyone gave a questionable quirk then looked to the sign with 
>the GP detectives face on it,

Mark:  Hey, it's a GP officer crossing sign!

>and over it a big red circle with a

Gene:  Target mark on it.

>red line going through it, instantly having a few sweatdrops pour 
>out in frustration.  As the time pass Kiyone temper rose.

Tim:  Kiyone then melted...

>As she was  now banging onto the hard wood door with her fist

Mark:  That has to hurt like hell after a while.

>"MIHOSHI GET OUT THE BASEMENT NOW BEFORE I..."

Tim:  Mihoshi, you get out the basement this instant before I
get a switch, young lady!

>The next few words

Gene:  DAMN!  SHIT!  BITCH!  DAMMIT!

Mark:  FUCK!  BITCH!  ASS!  DAMN!

>were muffled bye a swinging door in Kiyone jaw, Causing her to
>hit the floor in a instant with a wail of pain.

Mark:  Kiyone should just take out her gun and shoot her now!
It will end all this hell she's going through!

>And out step Mihoshi with the damaged electronic looking 
>good as new, well if you looked around the masking tape here and 
>there on the screen. 

Gene:  So Mihoshi solved the broken computer problem like a first
grader would...

Tim:  No, she "masked" the problem.

>"Finished Kiyone!" beamed Mihoshi with a near idiotic grin on 
>her face.

Mark:  (as Mihoshi)  I hope you like mud-pie!

>This was too hard to believe,

Gene:  It wasn't butter!

>or focus on as Kiyone shook her head a bit from the hit.
>"What? Let me see this" Kiyone stood up and yanked the laptop from
>Mihoshi's hands with a sneer of doubt.

Mark:  Great.  Now Kiyone's gonna break it.

"Hm, Well the crack doesn't show.." Kiyone looked

Tim:  Wait!  We want to see some lady's posterior area!

Mark:  Yeah!

Gene:  Mihoshi has invented another way to traffic drugs.

>more closely as well Washu, who was amazed at the fact that

Mark:  This fic was occuring differently than a normal fic would.

>of all people Mihoshi did something right for a change.

Tim:  Mihoshi became a nun.

>"Yep Yep!All it took was a few spare parts, glue, and a shiny rod
>thing for a battery!"

Gene:  And I used some spare haywire robot parts, too!  I hope
you don't mind a supercomputer mastermind!

>Mihoshi spoke on. Kiyone was indeed impress for once. Her partner
>finally fixed her own

Tim:  ...Brain!

>mistakes "Well...sorry for yelling at you earlier on Mihoshi,
>you're pretty competent" She apologize as Kiyone looked for the
>on switch.

Gene:  From the looks of this, I think it's too early to celebrate.

>"Wait a minute...shiny rod?" Washu interrupted. "Where did you get

Tim:  (as Washu) ...your hands on my dildo!?!?

>that from Mihoshi?" The blonde girl only gave a small shrug 
>of honesty "I saw it in that huge tube with the skull and 
>crossbones on it?"

Mark:  They're toast!

> "AHHH!!! MIHOSHI THAT ISNT A BATTERY THAT'S!" Kiyone flicked on 
>the switch as Washu was about to finish. "Wha?"

>"DANGER! DANGER! eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehh! GOBBLES!!!" 
>KA-BLAMMO!

Tim:  What the hell!?!?  I'm never eating turkey again!  It might
explode when I put it in the microwave!

Mark:  Especially explosive when combined with potatoes or frogs.

Gene:  Isn't KA-BlAMMO a show on Nickelodeon?

>"...uranium." Washu coughed out the last word, as she began to peel 

Gene:  ...her skin off due to the radioactivity.

>her self off the wall she was blasted into. Kiyone was in a 
>state of tears as she noticed the lab that self detonated  itself

Mark:  Wow, they were at ground zero and lived.  A physical
impossibility...

Tim:  (as Kiyone)  I WISH I WAS DEAD!

>now disintegrate into dust." MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHOSHI!!!!!"

Gene:  IT'S BEDTIME!

>On hearing  her name yelled in rage Mihoshi stared on the from
>the blast, her face covered in black soot like Kiyone and Washu.
>"um...heh heh.

Tim:  (in small child's voice)  I had an accident!

>Kiyone I had no idea that was- EEEEE!!"

Mark:  And now Mihoshi is a steaming pot of tea on a stove.

>And off The detective went sprinting down the hall like a scared
>puppy. "MIHOSHI GET BACK HERE!"

Gene:  You need a flea bath!

>Kiyone also took off in pursuit after Mihoshi in a burst of rage and
>with a head of steam.

Mark:  Cool!  There's a severed head of steam flying beside her!

Tim:  (as severed head of steam)  Mihoshiiiiiiii!  I have come to
take you to the depths of heeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllll!

>"Cmon Kiyone it was a accident!!"

Gene:  (as Mihoshi)  I didn't mean to wet my pants, really!

Tim:  (as Mihoshi) I didn't mean to throw up on you!

>Cried the bronzed girl as she took a sharp turn flailing and
>slipping the way out. "YA THE MILLIONTH ACCIDENT! NO MORE
>MIHOSHI!!!"

::All laugh at "YA THE MILLIONTH ACCIDENT!"::

Gene:  Is Kiyone a boxing promoter or something!?

>Having put up with her partners' accidents for too long,
>Kiyone finally leaped forward and grasped tackled Mihoshi into a 
>two-gal tumble.

Mark:  (as referee)  10 yard penalty for misconduct!

>Slip and slide went the GP tornado into the living room,

Tim:  Now they're a wrestling team.  THE GP TORNADO!

>screaming and arguing increasing each second. As it, 
>ended Kiyone pinned Mihoshi to the floor still in her semi 
>madness. "GOT YOU! YOU BUTTERFINGERED KLUTZ!" As they slide more 
>forward until the rug stopped them.

Tim:  (as Kiyone)  YOU LAID A FINGER ON MY BUTTERFINGER!

>"Er...Kiyone?" Mihoshi looked up to the detective's face a bit 
>concerned "You should get off me... people might think were 
>well..."

Gene:  Insert lesbo sex scene here!

>"WELL WHAT!" Kiyone interrupted Mihoshi shouting, causing the 
>girl to wince a little "Well...funny."

Mark:  Well, you two ARE the comic relief.

>If they already did not seem strange to most, Sure enough Aeka
>and Ryoko

Gene:  ...were lesbians, too!

>actually peeled their eyes off the T.V screen long enough
>to see Kiyone ontop of Mihoshi.  Numerous sweatdrops poured
>out of the blue- hair girl. "Ahh! Screw it!"

Tim:  (as Kiyone)  You can find another underrated GP officer's
life to ruin!

>Kiyone released Mihoshi wrist and threw the fist down at the girls'
>face. Mihoshi let out a yelp and moved her

Mark:  ...tail between her legs.

>head before the blurred punch reached her button nose. Kiyone
>retracted her hand in pain having it nail a dent in the floor.
>"AHHHH!!" The bronzed girl took the time to push over Kiyone

Mark:  (as Mihoshi, saracstically)  I was an ACCIDENT this TIME!
REALLY, Kiyone!

>and take off once more. Kiyone picked her self up and chased after
>her once more, now being lead back into the basement again.

Gene:  Now this fic is gonna repeat forever...

>"Hey....stop...you two?" Washu had now crawled out of the hole
>towards the door.  But now Kiyone was going to end this cat and
>mouse game as she corned Mihoshi on a wall.

Tim:  I wouldn't blame Kiyone.

Gene:  Yeah.  After role playing Tom and Jerry for a long time,
one would think Kiyone would be tired of playing Tom.

>"Oh no...eee! Kiyone don't hurt me!" Mihoshi begged as
>she looked around for an exit. "Great. Now this headache
>I've been having ever since I met you is going to go away."
>Kiyone walked forward with her eyes burning a hole in Mihoshi.

Tim:  (as Mihoshi)  Uh, 'scuse me Kiyone.  You're burning a hole
in me.  I can see my intestines now.

>"Headache?.." The clumsy GP thought as she looked to her left again 
>seeing a couple pills. Bingo! "I can fix your headache Kiyone!" she 
>latched her palms onto the spare pills on the shelf."Ha? No 
>I' don't mean a re-HEY!" Kiyone mouth was soon shoved of the green 
>tinted pills Mihoshi  made her swallow down.

Mark:  This ought to make her hallucinate!

Tim:  It's mayhem time!

>Kiyone gave a sick face and gulped them. "There. You feel better now?"
>Asked her partner who had the innocent face on once more.

Mark:  LOOK!  DEVIL HORNS ON MIHOSHI NOW!

>"Um...yes for some reason." Kiyone could actually smile having 
>those pains go away but now her body was reacting funny.
>Soon she made the dreaded... "pee dance"

Mark:  OH, NO GUYS!  Kiyone's doing the dreaded pee dance!

Gene:  Great.  Now it's gonna rain pee on us.

>"AHH DAMNIT MIHOSHI!" was her last words as she ran out the room
>biting her lip so hard it could bleed. "Wonder if that worked?"
>though the blonde girl as she stepped out as well. Kiyone reached
>the bathroom in seconds and shut the door. "Oh damnit what's wrong
>with me now?" she unzipped her white jeans and just closed her eyes,
>calming down  a bit. "What am I going to do with that ditz? She is
>so lazy, incompetent, noisy..." Oh, the words went on and on as she
>kept going.

Mark:  "Oh, the fic went on and on as the MSTers rotted."

Gene:  (as Kiyone impersonating Dennis Miller)  I don't mean to
get off on a rant, but that Mihoshi...!

>"She needs discipline...

Mark:  Then she shall become a Shaolin master!

>she needs to be useful...She....hey why am I standing up?" That
>and the slow dripping sound woke Kiyone up and forced her to look
>down. Okay. She was going in the toilet.

Tim:  This fic's appeal is going down the toilet.

>"But...im..not...sitting...dooowwnnn OH MY GOD I HAVE 
>A DICK!!!"

All:  OH JESUS!!!!!!!!

Gene:  ::Turning green.::  I will never masturbate to Kiyone the
same way again!  In fact, I'll never masturbate to Kiyone again!

Tim:  Thanks for the info. on your fantasy life, Gene!

Mark:  I am traumatized for life!

>Kiyone mentally roared out confused holding the 9inch

Tim:  So Kiyone's a fan of Nine Inch Nails?

Mark:  That is more detail than I need to know!

>in her palms all this time "What the fuck happened!?

Gene:  This fic happened!

>IM A FREAK!? THOSE--PILLS!" Of course, Mihoshi had caused Kiyone 
>another gray hair, but this one was running way down to 
>her pubics. . Staring at urine come out two ways was becoming a bit 
>disgusting.

Mark:  YOU THINK!?!?!?!?!?!

Tim:  Not the she-male theme again!

>So she just pressed it back in, but now she could
>stare at the huge bulge forcing  her fancy panties to expand. "oh 
>god this is too much why me?

>...IM going to get her this tim--EEP!"
>At the thought of Mihoshi the new girl penis

Gene:  Dicks belong to the male anatomy, thanks.

>stretched out in Kiyone's jeans. "Ahh jeez!  What's with this thing."
>She spoke under her breath,

Tim:  (as Kiyone)  It's broke!

>if anyone knew of this they would be scared out of their minds of it.

::All the MSTers are talking like they were members of the Masaki
household.::

Mark:  (as Tenchi)  Kiyone!  Is that a gun in your pocket or are you
happy to see me?

Tim:  (as Washu)  Now I can complete my freak show!

Gene:  (as Sasami)  Hey, Kiyone!  Do you want sausage for dinner!?

Tim:  (as Aeka)  Go away, you freak!

Mark:  (as Ryoko)  No wonder you were so uptight!  You were in the
closet!

>Now the erection was beginning to cause a small twinge of pain.
>"oh well.." Kiyone thought,"Until I tell Washu 
>about it...why not make a negative a positive?"

Gene:  I sense something bad about to happen at this part, guys.

Mark:  Here we go.

>In small chance of succeeding this, Kiyone decided to keep quiet
>about it until late at night, so she closed her door when entering
>it and whipped out the new organ once more, giving it a few looks
>over.

All:  ::Covering their eyes.::  AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

>"zzzzzz........zzzzz" Mihoshi dozed once more infront of the 
>TV, near slipping off the couch. Kiyone sneaked out the 
>area into the living room quietly, noticing the static on the T.V 
>set.

Tim:  I like that TV show!

>Creeping to her partner The officer wanted to make sure she 
>was knocked out. "Mihoshi?...Mihoshi are you awake?" No answer. 
>Good. Kiyone watched as each breath made the bronze 
>girls breasts heave up each time, waking up her new body part in no 
>time.

Mark:  She is NOT going to do what I think she's gonna do, right?

Tim:  This IS a lemon.  And besides, the human mind is unpredictable.

>Without a flinch, Kiyone worked her hands onto Mihoshi's shirt
>flipping it up easily. Carmel mounds

Gene:  My appetite for candy has gone away for some odd reason.

Mark:  And a good one, too.  You'd upchuck it all after watching this
scene.

>bounced out without any imprisonment of a bra, instead of a normal
>confused look, Kiyone stared in awe. "Wow...these are massive.."

Mark:  I think the pills are turning Kiyone into Mihoshi now.

Tim:  Why do you say that?

Mark:  It says "normal confused look".

>Without a second thought she snaked her hands under the left one
>and begin to rub it, a small moan emitted from the bronze GP, but
>increased her breathing a bit as Kiyone began to rub both of them 
>at the same time.

Gene:  Why did Kiyone have to grow a dick?  This is ruining the
lesbo elements for me.  

Tim:  You missed the disclaimer.  It said there wouldn't be any
normal lesbian sex.

Gene:  DAMN!

>The blue tressed Kiyone saw her partners' nipples also stiffen
>as a result, she slowly placed one leg over Mihoshi side now
>sitting on her. Bending down she cupped the erected pink nub
>into her mouth and licked it without hesitation.

Mark:  How can you cup a nipple?

Tim:  I don't know and I don't want to know.

>All the treatment on the top heavy Mihoshi

Mark:  What's this?

Gene:  Bad syntax...

>caused her to stir and moan a little more, but was still sound asleep. 
>Kiyone now had a grin on her face as she released the nipple from 
>her mouth, having excess spit still keeping them together,

Gene:  Is there any specific meaning to the sentence above?  I do not
understand how spit can keep nipples together.

Tim:  Remember that this is a senseless sex lemon and there is no
meaning to ANYTHING HERE!!!!

>andprogressed lower. A few seconds and Kiyone found her partners' 
>button on her pants, which she quickly ripped off. The hint of
>white under them made The police girls smile near Cheshire like, 
>pushing Mihoshi pants right off

Mark:  You don't push pants off.  You can either rip them off of TAKE
them off!

>to show her bare legs and the white panties she wore. Kiyone
>index poked onto the top of the panties on the head of the small
>penguin on it, Making another moan gasp from Mihoshi.
>"She is such a child."

Gene:  Kiyone:  The she-male / child molester story.

>Thought Kiyone about her cute undies, which she pulled to her left
>to show her partners pedals,

Gene:  One for accelerating, one for braking, and one for changing
gears.

>now slick with wetness. She must really be enjoying this as much
>as Kiyone was,

Tim:  She's asleep!

Mark:  I think the term we want to use here is "rape".

>as she knelt off Mihoshi and stuck her face onto the pussy.

Tim:  Damn!  Just dive right in!

>She wonder what would happen if she were too.  Up came a long...
>torturous lick on the lovetunnel,

Mark:  More bad syntax and bad grammar.

>causing an instant shriek of surprise in return from Mihoshi, who 
>soon grabbing out to nowhere, latching on some of the couch.

Gene:  I'm lost!

Tim:  This is hurting my brain.  I'm gonna sue Quatre for mental
harm.

>Kiyones' pink muscle traveled around inside Mihoshi, coming out 
>once and again over the top and diving in.

Mark:  Whoa!  THAT is one acrobatic tongue!

Tim:  It won the gold medal in the Tongue Olympics in '96.

>Even the pokes of her fingers Mihoshis'  rather shocking, true
>blonde pubic hair, cause the girls' legs to sprawl around with
>almost loud whimpers. 

Gene:  Look out!  More unintellegible gibberish!

>"ZZ ..,Oh..ooooh!" That did it. The blonde hair Mihoshi had 
>her limit, one loud moan and she gushed helplessly in 
>orgasm, spraying in Kiyone's face with her liquids." Huh? mmmph!"
>Kiyone was caught off guard by the mess her partner just
>made,

Mark:  This could be a paper towel commercial.  They could hold up
a paper towel and absorb all that orgasm stuff into it just like
they do on the commercials.

>but let it all splash on her face, or catch whatever she 
>could in her mouth letting it gulp down happily.

Tim:  Heads up!  More bad syntax and context and whatever else got
messed up!

>"Well...Wakey, Wakey, Mihoshi. "The quiet utter Kiyone spoke as she
>looked over to see her coming too.

Gene:  This fic sucks.

Mark:  Get used to it.

>"Wha....What??" Half-naked and all Mihoshi feel right off the 
>couch at the sudden look of Kiyones' face in a thud.
>"KIYONE!?"She shouted, but through mid-word Kiyone's hand clasped 
>around her mouth.

Tim:  It looks like she got a full word out on that one.

>Kiyone was silent with a grin on her face as she replaced
>Mihoshi spot on the couch with herself. "No sleep for you 'Hoshi"

Gene:  ::Laughing.::  HAHA!  I guess that's supposed to mean "hoe"?

>Kiyone than grabbed the back of the blonde girl's head in a grip,
>pressing her bronze face into the crotch of her shorts.

::All the MSTers watch in horror.::

>"Kiyone? Kiyone what are you talking about? What...Why" She wanted
>to scream, muffled between Kiyone's legs. "...Undo them with your
>teeth...now."

Tim:  For once in my life, I feel really sorry for Mihoshi.

>Silent, but stern as well, a voice Mihoshi knew too well that
>Kiyone was serious. She made a gulp and pressed her teeth onto
>the metal zip, slowly pulling down.

Mark:  I do not believe this is happening!

>What she got in reward

Mark:  What the fuck!?  Reward!?!

>was Kiyone's new harden length pressed into the side of her face,
>almost poking out the left eye.

Gene:  If it does poke her eye out she'll be lucky.  She won't see
TOO much of the horror we're seeing.

>Mihoshi was in silent terror, breathing becoming a bit rapid at
>the site. "K..Kiyone!? Kiyone grin came back again, as 
>she pushed her waist up a bit to let her meat slide on Mihoshi's 
>face.

::All scream.::

Tim:  ::Crying.::  What has the author DONE to Kiyone!?!?!  ::Cries
more.::

>"Thanks for giving me those pills Mihoshi...they got rid of 
>my headache, but look what I got in return" Her grip tightened 
>around the back of her partner's head, right in those blonde 
>strands of the quivering GP. "...Remember that tape I made you 
>watch? Of the guy and the girl back in the Yagami?"

Gene:  (as Mihoshi) Oh, you mean the tape of how real sex should be?

>Mihoshi was still a trembling a little, keeping her mouth shut
>tight as Kiyone began to probe her lips with the cock,

All:  AAAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!  GET THE IMAGE OUT OF OUR
MIND!!!!!!!!  AAAAAAUUUUUUUGHHHHHHH!!!!!!

>hesitantly nodding. "Good...guess what your gonna do?" The Cyan
>tressed police girl knew a little secret to get her mouth open, even 
>though Mihoshi kept it closed.

Mark:  We don't want to know or see it!!

>Her hand traveled down her chest a bit, getting to her Natural
>tanned massive globes. In a split second, she squeezed one
>playfully hard, forcing a yelp out of her. "ee!-mmph!" A
>confused daze replaced the look of fear on  Mihoshi's face.

Mark:  I'm running out of stuff to say.

Tim:  Me too.

Gene:  This fic is so terrible I don't have anything to say about it. 

>Inches of Kiyone being crammed into her mouth.

All:  AAAAAAAUUUUUUGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

Gene:  If it were a real guy, we wouldn't be so sickened!

Mark:  ::Looking at Gene with an eyebrow raised.::  Ooookayyy...

>A moment passed, numerous thoughts swirled in her head...
>what could she of done?" Kiyone looked down in Mihoshi's
>sincere eyes, submissive maybe. She could see blonde strands
>bob near her and back slowly with sloppy audible sounds of sucking.

Mark:  Please, give us more sick info. ...

>She let out a breathy pant and took that hold off her partner's
>head, placing them lightly on the top. Mihoshi tried to keep up the 
>rhythm of pleasing her partner, sliding her tongue around the 
>meaty flesh,

Tim:  That's, uhh,... really descriptive...

>trying hard not to bite down. She let the whole thing 
>come out her mouth, holding the rod carefully in her hands as 
>she serviced the head better.

Mark:  Lovely...

>Kiyone moaned lazily with a wider smile "That's...pretty good
>Mihoshi" But it changed to a smirk. "I guess you watch that
>tape more often...don't you"

Gene:  You're accusing someone as bubbleheaded as Mihoshi of
watching XXX porn?

>she stopped with a  breath. "Slut?" those words made Mihoshi pick up her 
>pace, feeling the head of it bulge in her slippery mouth. All the 
>sounds and attention on her made Kiyone grit her teeth with 
>wincing eyes "Uwhaaa...going  to....!" With a sharp moan, she 
>splurged out onto Mihoshi face with hot gushing semen

Gene:  Now Mihoshi's gonna need face recovering surgery.

Tim:  At least Sasami isn't being forced to do this.  We've been
lucky since the first fic.

>Mihoshi nearly gagged on what shot into her mouth, pulling out
>Kiyone's tool from her mouth. More of it spluttered onto her cheeks and 
>button nose, dribbling down onto her breasts. Sky blue eyes looked 
>right into Kiyones' with a mouth full of cum, showing her 
>gulp hard the salty goodness down her buttery throat.

All:  YUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKK!!!

Mark:  I'll never eat popcorn again!

Gene:  (as Adam Sandler)  This popcorn tastes fucking terrible!  It
tastes liked someone jizzed all over it!

Tim:  How will we end this horror!?!?!?!?!

Gene:  I've got it!  ::Pulls out a Caster shell gun hidden in his pants'
leg.::  Quatre's minions didn't check this part!

>"Its...very warm" She made a small hiccup of embarrassment."Oooh..

Mark:  Ooooooooooohhhhhkkkkkkaaaaaaayyyyyyy.

::Gene shoots a Caster shell toward the projection booth.::

Quatre:  OH, SHIT!  ::Runs.::

::The projection booth is destroyed and the fic is over.::

1...2...3...4...5...6...7...

******************************************

Mark:  Fic...too terrible...  AAUGH.

Gene:  So this is what hell is like...

Tim:  Worst fic to date...

::Quatre appears on the big screen TV.::

Quatre:  GENE!!!!!!!  You destroyed the projection booth!

Gene:  Pretty funny, huh?

Quatre:  No matter.  I keep extras just in case.  I'll get an
interchangable projection booth and replace the old one tomorrow!
And I'll seal acess between the ships.

All:  NOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Gene:  And that was my last Caster shell.

Tim:  And that'll be my last chance to see Aisha Clanclan!!!!

::The crew of the Outlaw Star walks in with a small Gilliam
unit floating behind them.::

::Tim sees Aisha Clanclan.::

Tim:  Duh-duhduhduhduhduhduhdDER!!!!

::Tim runs toward Aisha but is malleted by Gene.::

Aisha:  What was up with that guy?

Gene:  Don't mind the loser.

::Birds fly around Tim's head.::

Tim:  X.x  @.@  LALALALA!

Mark:  Though I like Suzuka, I won't make the same mistake.

::Mark turns toward the readers.::

Mark:  Till then, see you next time!
