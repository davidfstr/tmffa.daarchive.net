OPENING THEME: "Hooked On a Feeling" by B.J. Thomas

When we last left our victims of circumstance (friggin' circumstance...), 
they were
busy trying to sort out the cruel hand, dealt so generously by fate. 
Friggin' fate...

	Now, it is a little later than where we left off. As they are stuck in the 
Tolp
hole, time doesn't really pass in the common sense (friggin' common 
sense...), so where
WE are, they didn't have enough time for Cap to install a Fanfic alert 
system, Kaneda to
have a few hundred things to eat, Akane to perfect a new mallet kata, Noa to 
draw some
fanart of the Wing Zero, Mihoshi to read quite a few shoujo manga (don't 
ask), or Washu to
merge the Hamdinger with the Yukinojo. But, we're in the Tolp hole, and all 
this has had
time to occur. Our intrepid crew is now on the new bridge, as a test of the 
Emergency
Fanfic System.

And to be assigned the positions on board the Hamdinger.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CAPTAIN TWISTER: The Cap. Head Honcho/Genius. The proverbial popsicle stand 
is his
to command. The inventor of the Tolp device. (I want down.)

AKANE TENDO: Ship's tomboy/den mother of sorts. Mallet specialist. (RANMA NO 
BAKAAA!!)

NOA IZUMI: Ship's well-meaning Labor pilot/tomato connoiseur. Keeps our 
sanity. (I do?)

KANEDA: Ship's goof/heavy artillery/decoy. Anime old timer. (Young 
whippersnappers...)

MIHOSHI KURAMITSU: The pilot/navigator, in charge of not crashing. (So... 
I'm not supposed to
push THIS button?)

and the new AI:

YUKINOJO: In charge of talking to/repairing Sal. (HELP MEEEE!!)

Now that we're all up to date on current affairs...

***************************************************
THE HAMDINGER MSTS- EPISODE TWO

A GLIMPSE OF A LEMONY FUTURE! THE CREW'S NIGHTMARISH TORTURE!
***************************************************

And speaking of the passage of time in the Tolp hole...

	"TWO MONTHS?!" the crew exclaimed.

	"Uh huh," said Washu's image on the transculent window. "And in this
reality, it's been back to the old Universe theory for about a month, three
weeks, and six days."

Cap facefaulted, while the rest of the crew snickered. Well, Mihoshi was too
nice to snicker, so she just stared at Washu.

	"Washu-chan?" Mihoshi asked.

	"Yeah, Mihoshi?""

	"Um... did you ever find out what button I pushed?"

At this, the rest of the crew and Washu facefaulted.

	"ANYway," said Washu, getting up from the dent in the lab floor, "Cap and I 
still
gotta brief you guys-"

	"We're not guys!" shouted Akane, Noa, and Mihoshi in unison.

	"...'kay," said Washu. "Movin' on. Cap, you wanna go first?"

	"Okee dokee, littlest genius," Cap said before having Michalangelo's David 
dropped on
his head.

	"That's enough'a that," said Washu, removing her finger from the 
"correction" button.

	"Yeaahhh..." Groaned Cap, before the statue slid off his head and off the 
set. "Anyway,
I just installed a fanfic alert system on the ship."

	"They're so bad we need an alert system?" Noa asked.

	"Well, we can't be too careful," said Cap. "This is stuff that messed up 
the SAL9001."

Everyone sighed and rolled their eyes in response. Except for Mihoshi, who 
was busy digesting
this information.

	"So, it's just like a regular alarm system?"

	Cap was silent for a moment. Then, he thought of the most appropriate 
response.

	"Yeppers!" he replied. "At least in theory..." He trailed off.

There was a moment of silence for a moment, giving all present time to 
sweatdrop.

	"What the hell does "in theory" mean?" Asked... Noa?! (Somebody's been here 
a tad
too long for someone's tastes.)

	"... I don't know..." answered Cap. "Let's test it!"

	"Let's not!" said everyone else. Except Mihoshi, who's uncharactaristically 
quiet.

Cap sweatdropped and allowed Washu to add her little accomplishment. Little 
only compared
to his, of course.

	"Okee dokee!" Washu said, cricking her neck, "After I found out the 
sequence Cap
entered on the Tolp device, I managed to figure out what happened to the 
universe-"

	"ANIverse, Washu-chan," Cap corrected, a self-satisfied smile on his face.

	"...'kay," replied Washu. "Anyway, the ANIverse, is connected by something 
we in the
scientific circle like to call the 'Fourth Wall'".

	"The thing that Kaneda broke?" Asked Akane.

	"Yep," replied Washu. Kaneda scowled. "Cap, you've invented a doozy, here. 
The Tolp
device shouldn't even exist."

	The crew collectively "ooooooo"ed in response to this new revelation. Cap 
smiled,
a smile of one who'd just defied all laws that govern the uni... aniverse. I 
have to get
used to calling it that, too.

	"Buuut..." Washu started, shutting everyone up.






























This is indicative of a suspenseful silence.
















Its purpose is to create tension and add to plot.
















	"But," Washu continued, "you can only access the other areas of the ship if 
I put the
theater in another dimension. Once-"

	"the fanfic alert system starts to go off, the theater dimension's 
automatically
connected, but we have to hurry inside as fast as we can," interrupted Cap.

	"... how'd you manage that, Twister?" Asked Washu.

	Cap grinned. "It's because I'm smaaaaaarrt..."

	"And you suck at impressions." Kaneda quipped.

	"But, while you guys-"

	"We're not GUYS!" Akane and Noa pointed out.

	"... people... are in there watching those fics, we're gonna need someone 
to monitor
how Sal's doing. Speakin' of which, how's Yukinojo?"

	"Yeah, how is he?" Mihoshi inquired, giving Cap those eyes she gives when 
she expects
an innocent answer.

	Cap remembered that Sal and Yukinojo had unimpeded access to each other. 
And Sal, being
the hentai-corrupted Overfiend worshipper that she was at the moment...

	"Mihoshi," Cap asked, a nervous smile on his face, and a sweatdrop covering 
the rest of
his head, "do you know how babies are made?"

Mihoshi blushed very red, averted everyone's gaze, and pressed the tips of 
her index fingers
together. That was all anyone needed to see.

	"Mihoshi, I think you're gonna be the pilot of this outfit." Akane said. 
"At least until
we can get out of here. " She threw a look at Cap and Washu. And Kaneda, for 
that matter.

	"That'd be a good idea," Washu said. "The REST of you guys are gonna have 
to get me info
on those fics. While you're in the theater," she continued, chuckling a 
little, "you really
shouldn't try to get out. I don't know _where_ you're gonna end up."

	"... what?" Everyone asked, looking somewhat displeased at Washu.

	"Yeah, sorry 'bout that," Washu said, typing away, looking not sorry in the 
leastest.
"While you guys (TWIN GLARE) 're in there this time, I'll see if I can get 
you a break, or two. Some of
these are pretty big."

	"Okay," Cap said, turning to the rest of the crew, "Are we up to this?"

	Everyone hesitated.

	"Great!" Cap exclaimed, looking very excited. He entered a sequence on the 
Tolp device,
and the Tube made its appearance. "Everybody in the lounge!" And everybody 
did, some more
enthusiastic than others. Well, Cap was the enthusiastic one. Mihoshi was a 
little confused.
A LITTLE! (I don't think she's stupid!)

******************* A few hours later

	"Well," said Noa, thinking out her decision carefully, "I guess these 
things are bad
enough that we've got to do some research... I'm in."

Cap wrote her name down in a little notebook, making her a member of the 
team.

	"Well... I guess we gotta.. find out what's messin' with all of us. But, 
first chance
I get, I'm gone." Kaneda said.

Cap wrote Kaneda's name down, too. All eyes turned to Akane.

	"... I'm in. I just hope we're not... wherever we are, for long."

Cap wrote Akane's name down, and turned to Mihoshi.

	"Yes." Mihoshi saluted. "I swear I will do my duty as the pilot and 
navigator of the
Hamdinger, and monitor the new discoveries of the Hamdinger Fanfiction 
Research team!"

	"Alright!" Cap exclaimed, putting the notebook into his tunic pocket. "Now, 
all we have
to do is wait for a fic."

And he did just that, smiling all the while.

	"This ain't permanent," Kaneda pointed out.

Then all of a sudden... as though nobody expected it... the klaxons blared, 
and the police
light came on...

"EL VIAJE MYSTERIOSO DI HAMDINGER COMMENCEEEEEEEEEE!!!

"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!" everyone except Cap shouted over the noise, 
holding their ears.

"IT'S SAL!" Cap shouted back. "I THINK IT MEANS WE GOT A FIC!!"

"WE GOT A FIC?!" everyone yelled.

"WE GOT A FIC!!!"

"DAMMIT!"

Everyone rushed into the theater, while Mihoshi ran into the tube. She took 
a moment to
collect her bearings and stop her head from spinning, then waited for the 
tube to open,
taking her to the bridge. It was a very clean tube. It is The Tube.

And so the MST begins...

*****************************************************************************************
(The crew enters the theater. Seating from left to right is: Noa, Cap, 
Akane, Kaneda.)

AKANE: So, let me see if I've got this right. This fic is from the future?
TWISTER: That's what Washu said, anyway.
AKANE: A few months in the future from where we are?
TWISTER: Yeah, Washu gave us that much.
AKANE: And you don't find this strange?
TWISTER: ... No, not after falling through a Tolp hole, breaking
spaceships up into different dimensions and having my remaining
database infested with pornographic anime stories.
NOA: That "Needful Things" story wasn't too bad, though.
TWISTER: Yeah, that was okay.

Nude Striker Tenchi
---

ALL:...
AKANE: Nude Striker WHAT?!

By The Super Retarded Kid, Alienboy 52

NOA: ... I have a very, VERY bad feeling!
KANEDA: He's modest, innee?

Disclaimer:

TWISTER: (Alienboy52) The brain I'm using is the result of foreign 
substances.

Are you 18?

ALL: Yes.
AKANE: Are you?

Don't read,

TWISTER: Don't write.

evil story is rearing it's perverted head.

KANEDA: (author) Because I can't get any.
OTHERS: *chuckle*

Tenchi Muyo belongs to Pioneer and AIC.

TWISTER: Who would be right to sue you, but you're poor. Am I right?

What bothers me is that people don't know what sashimi is. But it won't 
matter
as soon as the Japanese perfect their new man-eating Megamans.

NOA: What could "man-eating Megamans" have to do with sashimi?
AKANE: (sarcastic) I see the author has a life outside his Nintendo.
KANEDA: AIC could sue that off him!

---

TWISTER: It's an "S".
NOA: No, it's an "O".
TWISTER: Oh.

The cool wind blowing at Tenchi's back, the cold piece of sliced of fish 
beneath
his
feet.

ALL: (blink) ...................... Huh?
KANEDA: This isn't arousing!
NOA: I can see this plot's taken an interesting turn...

	"HEY! Wait a second, am I on a plate of sashimi?!?" exclaimed Tenchi.

KANEDA: Tenchi's a bright boy, isn't he?
TWISTER: Period after "second", you Super Retarded Kid.

	"Yes! You are! TENCHI!" exclaimed the voice.

AKANE: The hell?!
TWISTER: Tenchi's a schizo...
NOA: and the voice he hears is a horrible dub!

	"OH NO! I don't think I wanna be in this dream, somebody let me out!" 
yelled
Tenchi.

KANEDA: He's having wet dreams of being on a plate of sashimi?!
NOA: Well, I guess we know why he doesn't notice the girls
now, don't we?
ALL: (shake heads sadly)

	"That's! RIGHT! You don't! BUT! You have no! CHOICE!" explained the voice.

TWISTER: (voice) Pro. to. cul. ture.

	"...Look how you're speaking, it's wrong!

AKANE: Said the pot!

Correct yourself!" bravely shouted
Tenchi.

NOA: (to Cap) Cap, was he using bad grammar?
TWISTER: Yes. But, don't forget!
ALL: He's SUPER RETARDED!

	"HOW! DARE! YOU! !!!

AKANE: (voice) PRO! TO! CUL! TURE!

YOU WILL!!! SUF!!!!!!!!..fer..." violently said the voice.

TWISTER: That a warning?
KANEDA: (voice) IT!!! 'S!!! APROM!!! ISE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AKANE: (To Kaneda) It was neat how you said that.
KANEDA: Really?
AKANE: (mallets Kaneda) NO! *WHAM*

	"The voice's words seem to be very violent, perhaps Tenchi you should think 
of
flying high, streaking in the sky for the bright tomorrow." said an 
approaching
figure.

ALL: WHAT?!
TWISTER: This is like... Lewis Caroll gone horribly WRONG!

	"What! Do! You think! You! Are doing! Approaching! Figure! I! Am! The! 
VOICE!"
insanely ranted the voice.

AKANE: (voice) You. made me. wr. ite. l. emon. CRAP!!
KANEDA: Nah, this is worse than crap. It's "Nude Striker Tenchi".

	"Hey, I just realized, Tenchi, your ass look!" said Ryo-Oh-Ki who had 
created
itself
from the sashimi.

TWISTER: That's kind of hard to visualize. But, I really don't care.
And your grammar is about as coherent as this fic.
KANEDA: What was that about Tenchi's ass?
TWISTER: I don't know. What was the point of this fic, again?

---

AKANE: He hit the same key three times in a row. I'm impressed!

	"What kind of weird dream was that?" Tenchi asked himself, "I should ask my
dad."

NOA: Tenchi, do yourself a favor and lie awake in bed
for the rest of the day.
KANEDA: And get professional help.

	"No, we'll do next month," said Yosho.

AKANE: They'll do... _what_ next month?
OTHERS: Stupid things.

	"Huh! Grandpa, what are you doing in here?" asked Tenchi.

TWISTER: (Yosho) Doing next month.

	"NOTHING AT ALL, and any ass pain you may have was in no way caused by me,"
Yosho explained.

ALL: O_O;;;
KANEDA: Oh shit...
TWISTER: I don't like this... not a bit...
NOA: This is... not... good...
AKANE: This is disturbing...

	"Oh okay! Good night Grandpa," said Tenchi, now noticing a pain in his ass.

KANEDA: (praying) Please just say he has to go to the can,
please just say he has to go to the can...
TWISTER: Tenchi... barricade the door!

	"Hehehe, now that you sleep I can..."

ALL: EEEEEEEEK! O_O

	"Grandpa, I'm not asleep yet, jeez, the way your acting I would think you 
were
Jesus."

ALL: ... (yes, we ALL know where that reference came from, don't we? -_-)
KANEDA: (stops praying pretty quick)

	"NO! Haahaahaa! Good night Tenchi!" said Yosho as he left Tenchi's room.

NOA: ... This is BEYOND retarded!
TWISTER: I should have brought vomit bags.
AKANE: This isn't your fault, Cap.
KANEDA: The author just doesn't have a (...) clue!

--- 1 month later

AKANE: This is stupidity on an epic scale!

	"Hey grandpa! I'm going to tell my father about my dream now, " said 
Tenchi.

NOA: Just RUN, for God's sakes!
TWISTER: (To God) Do you REALLY hate us?
AKANE: (ditto) Or just Twister?

	"Okay Tenchi, but on your way to your dad do you think you can deliver 
these
flowers
to Azaka and Kamadake?" asked Yosho, holding up a dozen red roses.

TWISTER: The logs? HE'S GOT THE LOGS?!
ALL: NOOOOOOOO!!

	"Uhhh..."

AKANE: I wonder what would happen if Tenchi refused.
NOA: He'd just be raped a little sooner than we expected.
ALL: .....................(break into sobs)

	"Hey, you don't ask, and I won't ask about those weird noises Sasami's been
making
lately," said Yosho.

ALL: Oh no...
AKANE: (To Twister) I THOUGHT YOU SAID SASAMI LEMONS DIDN'T EXIST!!
TWISTER: I'm sooorrryyy! ;_;

	"But, I though that was you," said Tenchi.

NOA: (nervously) Yosho and Sasami?
OTHERS: (mallet Noa) *WHAM*x3

	"Oh yeah, well just drop the flowers off anyway," said Yosho, shoving the 
roses
into
Tenchi's hands and pushing him out of the shrine.

TWISTER: (narrator) and down the stairs!
AKANE: Nope.
TWISTER: Crud!

	"Hm, roses for logs, well I guess that isn't too weird. I just wish I knew 
why
I was
getting this ass pain," said Tenchi as he walked off towards the house.

KANEDA: Ask voice.

---

NOA: It's the plot. Minus three points.

	"Ryoko, you die, I kill you now! Tenchi mine!" shouted Ayeka.

AKANE: At least we can guess at the author's level of literacy, can't we?
KANEDA: Yeah. He doesn't have one.

	"NO! Tenchi mine! I kill you Ayeka!" shouted Ryoko.

TWISTER: (Ryoko) Ayeka, ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!!
AKANE: (To Twister) I'll let that go as long as the author
doesn't make a Zero Wing reference.
TWISTER: Okay.
AKANE: Not one!

	Sasami heard her sister and Ryoko fighting in the living room over Tenchi
again.

AKANE: Kill them Sasami! End the madness!
NOA: (sarcastic) I wonder what she's cooking right now...

She
wished that she could be like Tenchi, admired by all the girls, fought over 
by
busty women.

ALL: ...
KANEDA: Awww SH*T!
TWISTER: This is gonna be bad...
NOA: Didn't we already say something like this?
OTHERS: Yes.

After all, boys have cooties.

ALL: o_O
THE GUYS: (check their hair)
NOA: THAT'S _SASAMI_?!
OTHERS: No!

How she wanted Ryoko to remove Ayeka's eye and place it
in her cunt.

ALL: _WHAT?!?!?! O_O;;;;

To
have Ayeka shove Ryoko's head up her ass.

ALL: (stare in sheer horror)

	"OH! I WANT YOU RYOKO AND AYEKA!!!" moaned Sasami.

ALL: No...

	"Really, well then, perhaps you don't mind if I tape it," said Nobuyuki.

ALL: Don't...

	"Grrr... you dirty man! You probably took my virginity while I was 
sleeping!"
yelled
Sasami.

NOA: Does she even know what "virgin" means?

	"No I didn't! Honest!" said Nobuyuki.

KANEDA: Well, he's somewhat in character.
TWISTER: That doesn't mean the fic makes sense!
AKANE: I never wanted to see this... why, God? Why?
AREN'T I MISERABLE ENOUGH?!

	"I don't believe you.

TWISTER: He put a period at the end of his sentence!
OTHERS: (sarcastic) We can't believe it.

We all know that Tenchi is too much of a loser to try to
fuck me,

AKANE: And he's not a pedophile.

and Yosho is not a dirty old man!" Yelled Sasami, "it has to be you!"

ALL: ............................................
TWISTER: Do I sense some flawed reasoning?

	"Well you're right Tenchi is too much of a loser, but Yosho can be pretty 
dirty
you
know," said Nobuyuki.

TWISTER: Being a warped, stupid, and perverted shadow of Yosho, and all.

	"LIAR!" yelled Sasami as she kicked Nobuyuki out of the house.

AKANE: But, isn't it technically HIS house?
NOA: The fic doesn't make sense. The sooner we accept that, the better.
TWISTER: Maybe it won't bother us as much!
ALL: (sit still, thinking happy thoughts and wearing happy faces) This fic 
is
dumb... deal with it! This fic is dumb... deal with it! This fic is dumb...

---

AKANE: (stops chanting) Cap?
TWISTER: (stops chanting as well) Yes?
AKANE: That didn't work.
TWISTER: I know. ;_;

	Nobuyuki flew out of the house and landed on a Tenchi holding Yosho's 
roses.

TWISTER: A lot can happen... out of the blue.
AKANE: Yeah, like a Nobu- bomb.
ALL: DUCK AND COVER!

	"Dad! Where'd you come from?" asked Tenchi.

NOA: (Noboyuki) Well son, a long time ago, my mommy and Daddy loved each 
other
very much...

	"It doesn't matter, but I heard that you have something to tell me," said
Nobuyuki.

KANEDA: (Tenchi) Yeah, but who told you?
TWISTER: (Nobuyuki) voice did. I hear him, too!

	"Well dad, I've been having these weird dreams for a month now, and every 
time
I wake
up my ass is sore," said Tenchi.

TWISTER: We can all guess as to what it is, but the most likely answer is 
PERVERTED
LEMONS!

	"Mmm... your ass..." cooed Nobuyuki.

ALL: O_O;;; Oh no...

	"Dad, horniness has just entered me! I need your hot cock in my ass!" 
exclaimed
Tenchi.

ALL: No!

	"Yes

ALL: We said no!

the horniness had also entered me as well! My cock extends in happiness!"
Noboyuki
said excitedly.

ALL: NO!

	"Joy, joy, please insert your cock into my tight young ass!" instructed 
Tenchi.

ALL: NNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

	"My penis dances with happiness, sphincter expansion is possible!" yelled 
Yosho
as he
inserted his big, hot penis into Tenchi's tight hot boy ass.

ALL: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
*collective vomit*

	"Ah! Your Godzilla is making Tokyo explode and rejoice in victory," moaned
Tenchi as
he felt his dad's penis rub against his tight boy intestine.

ALL: *BLAAAAAARF*
TWISTER: HOW STUPID IS THIS GOING TO GET?! *BARF*

	"Tenchi! ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!!!" yelled Nobuyuki as he exploded 
his
man
cream into his young son's ass.

ALL: (stop vomiting for a second)
TWISTER: I didn't know that was in there.
OTHERS: (get that look in their eyes)
TWISTER: I really didn't! No!
OTHERS: (mallet Cap) *WHAM*x3x2

	"Dad, did you just say what I think you said?" asked Tenchi.

Akane: He did, Tenchi. And yes, it WAS very stupid.

	"Uh, well CATS and I were..."

NOA: (Nobuyuki) ... NOT in any kind of relationship.
TWISTER:(ditto) Unless that counts as something. I don't know,
in this fic, I'm the kind of guy that would nail a toaster! (pulls out the
pink, fluffy toaster)
OTHERS: (give Cap a well-deserved malleting) *KA-WHUBBAAA*!!
TWISTER: @_@
(Burnt toast pops out of the toaster)

	"Get out of me dad! I don't know you anymore!" said Tenchi as he pulled his
dad's dick
out of his tight young ass and ran off crying.

AKANE: (To Tenchi) Don't forget the fic!
TWISTER: And thus, we come to the "Nude Striker Tenchi" plot point.
AKANE: Weren't they wearing clothes?
TWISTER: I don't... know...

	"He is on the path to destruction..." said a mysterious voice.

ALL: Good.
NOA: That was a short trip.

---

KANEDA: In case you were wondering, we think that page break is stupid, too.

	"Kamadake! Yosho doesn't love us anymore!" cried Azaka.

KANEDA: He never did.

	"What do you mean Azaka?" asked Kamadake.

NOA: (Azaka) I mean, he's acting like he doesn't have a log fetish.
OTHERS: DON'T SAY FETISH!!

	"He promised us, and, and..."

TWISTER: (Azaka) Ah, quit bellyachin'.
AKANE: Uh, wasn't Kamidake the one in the last line?
TWISTER:....... I don't care.

	"Don't worry Azaka, Yosho will come, I have faith in him.

NOA: (Kamidake) And sugarlumps cure tooth decay. I have faith in that.
AKANE: (ditto) We're so in character!

	"Don't you see Kamadake, he's using us, to get to them. He's using us to 
fuck
Tenchi
and Sasami!" cried Azaka.

ALL: ACK!
TWISTER: Like I said. The plot.
KANEDA: Not to mention the atrocius grammar!
OTHERS: "Atrocius"?
KANEDA: I'm trying to show how much smarter I am than this fic.

	"No! It's a lie, I won't believe it."

AKANE: This is, quite possibly, the WORST soap opera I have ever seen!
OTHERS: No, really?
AKANE: Yes, really.
OTHERS: ...Oh.
AKANE: Heh.

	"Can you see with that mechanical glass eye!

AKANE: Can you ask questions without a question mark!
TWISTER: (Azaka, or whoever's talking) Yes, I can?

No one loves us, not even Yosho."

NOA: It's probably better that way.
KANEDA: Hell, it IS better that way!

	"No, it can't be true..."

KANEDA: (Kamidake) I DON'T have sex with anybody!

	"Don't worry though Kamadake, I love you."

ALL: Oh GOD!! O_O

	"I love you too Azaka, we should fuck."

NOA: I think NOT!

	"Excellent idea Kamadake."

KANEDA: My head...
OTHERS: (looking green) Don't mention "head".
(all cover mouths)

---

NOA: It says "This fic is unabridged garbage".
TWISTER: In braille?

	"Sasami is it true, do you really feel that way about me, and Ryoko? asked
Ayeka.

AKANE: (Sasami) NO!

	"Yes, every word of it,

AKANE: AAAAARRRRGGGGHHH!!!

I wish that I could be Tenchi, so that when you look at
me I
can feel you gaze upon me. That itself would make me content." said Sasami.

ALL: *groan*
KANEDA: The author is...
OTHERS" The author is... what?
KANEDA: (...)ed in the head!
NOA: I concur. Yes, I do.

	"How romantic..." sighed Ryoko.

NOA: (green) This is all we need. A stupid lemon AND a stupid...
everything else.

	"And every time I make my meals, I put not just good food, but my feelings 
for
both of
you into making the meal.

TWISTER: Of course she does. She loves everyone in the house like her 
family.
AKANE: *sigh* Spelling, grammar and general sanity just doesn't amount to a
good lemon.
NOA: This is a good lemon?
AKANE: Only because it can't get worse and the sex is so stupid we can't get
aroused and feel guilty.

I could never choose between either of you. I love you
equally, you as
my sister, and you as my friend. But I can no longer just let my love go
unanswered, I need you
to be more than just a sister and a friend, I need you to be with me, as
lovers." said Sasami.

ALL: No, you do NOT!!

	"Oh Sasami, your elegant and to the heart speech has made me realize my 
error
in wanting
Tenchi.

KANEDA: Ah sh*t, here we go...
ALL: Fudge crackle...

I should've realized that you were truly the one for me, not a loser
boy," said Ayeka.

TWISTER: Who loves you and would protect you with his life.
AKANE: I think Ayeka might have been referring to the author.
KANEDA: Sh*t, I hope not!
OTHERS: Language!

	"Yes Sasami, I no longer have feelings for Tenchi, but for you. I never
realized what
true love was until you just showed me it." explained Ryoko.

ALL: She DIDN'T!!
AKANE: Ryoko is NOT a freakin' PEDOPHILE!!

	Sasami looked into Ayeka's and Ryoko's eyes and blushed. "Now that I know 
that
we all
feel the same way, we should make our love physical."

ALL: (sob uncontrollably)

	"Yay! SEX!" shouted Washu, who had appeared to say those two words.

KANEDA: Yay! SEX!
ALL: Fun-ny...
AKANE: Stu-pid...
TWISTER: Au-thor...
KANEDA: He's funny?!
KANEDA: No.

	Ryoko grabbed Sasami's head and touched her own lips to the little girl's,
embracing in
a warm kiss.

ALL: AAAAAAAAAAAIIIIEEEEEE!!!

Ayeka began to remove her own clothes and watched as Ryoko kissed
Sasami. Sasami
broke the kiss and opened up Ryoko's top, grabbing one of Ryoko's breasts 
and
sucking on the
pink nipple. Ryoko smiled watching Sasami suckle on her breast as if she 
were a
mere babe.

ALL: SHE IS UNDERAGE!!!

	Ayeka had stripped herself naked and moved over to Sasami, and knelt down 
so
she would
face her sister's crotch. Ayeka quickly pulled down Sasami's pants, panties, 
and
began licking at
her younger sibling's pubensent blue haired pussy.

ALL: 
*BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!*
(pause)
ALL: "pubensent"?
(and back to...)
*HUUUUUUUGGH*

Sasami stopped sucking

AKANE: (stops vomiting) But the fic was beyond hope. *BARF*

on
Ryoko's breasts and
looked down at the mound of purple hair now surrounding her cunt, laughing a
little, then
moaning in pleasure.

TWISTER: Sal, I can see just how this messed you up.
KANEDA: I want to kill this guy.

	"Hey Ayeka, is she wet now?" asked Ryoko.

AKANE: Yes, but not in the way YOU were thinking.
OTHERS: (mallet Akane) *WHAM*
OTHERS: BAD Akane!
AKANE: @_@ That hurts...
NOA: Right... how did we all do that?
ALL: .............................................

	"Mmm... tastes like it, why do you ask?"

TWISTER: (Ryoko) Because if she is, something is VERY wrong.

	"Perfect... that means I can do this!" yelled Ryoko as she grabbed Ayeka's
head.

KANEDA: Right. That makes sense.

	"Huh? What are you doing Ryoko?" asked Ayeka.

AKANE: Something entirely stupid, no doubt.

	"There's only room for one person to love Sasami, and that person is me!" 
Ryoko
yelled
slowly shoving Ayeka's head into Sasami's rapidly expanding pussy.

ALL: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
TWISTER: Not... physically... possible!

Blood began
to spill out of
Sasami's little vagina as Ayeka's head sunk deeper and deeper into the young
girl.

ALL: (stare completely terrified at the screen)
TWISTER: (traumitized at this scene) SASAMI-CHAAAAANNN!!
ALL: (wail uncontrollably)

Sasami cried
out in pain,

AKANE: God... damn... it...
ALMIGHTY: Gladly!
ALL: (they didn't notice the Almighty)
ALMIGHTY: *sigh* How come nobody EVER pays attention? It's
like I don't even exist!

and Ayeka tried to pull her head out of her sister, but Ryoko's
strength was too
much for the princess.

NOA: Logs... use the LOOOOOGS!!
KANEDA: (VERY sick) Don't mention the logs. Not now.
Not after the last scene...

Ayeka struggled inside of Sasami, trying desperatly to
get out so that she
could get a breath of air, just one gasp, to survive, just one, breath.

TWISTER: That last sentence was so incredibly STUPID that...
KANEDA: (To Twister) That what?
TWISTER: Uh... I don't know... the fic is destroying my intelligence...
thinger.
NOA: Somebody mention "Winger"?
OTHERS: NO! >_<

	Ryoko looked down at the body coming out from Sasami's bloody pussy, it 
stopped
moving.

TWISTER: If the author makes one more stupid thing happen, we're leaving. 
Okay?
OTHERS: (nod enthusiastically)
AKANE: (stops nodding) My neck hurts...

She had succeeded in killing the first princess of Jurai, Ayeka.

ALL: Kill us, too.
NOA: Under normal circumstances, that would have
killed the secong princess of Jurai, Sasami, too.
AKANE: But, THAT (points at screen) can't happen.

	"Sasami, I'm sorry, I had to kill her."

AKANE: (Ryoko) I'm also sorry for being a completely sick
and disgusting pervert.
TWISTER: (Sasami) Really?
AKANE: (Ryoko) I would be, but I'm also completely stupid.

	"Ryoko, I understand, you love me so much that you're willing to sacrifice 
my
sister
to ensure it."

NOA: Sasami, you understand absolutely nothing.
KANEDA: (Sasami) Goddamn fic!

	"Actually, I'd kill her anyway, but, I couldn't stand to let her touch 
you."

TWISTER: Who ARE these people?!

	"Hahaha!

NOA: This can't be Tenchi. This dub is horrible!

It's okay Ryoko, but do you think you could remove her head from me?
It really
hurts.

AKANE: The fact that it's a physical impossibility
just MIGHT have something to do with that.

Actually, I sorta wanted something like this to happen, except I expected
Ayeka to shove
your head up my ass."

ALL: *BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRFFFFFFFF!!!*
TWISTER: I have nothing left...
AKANE: (swallows) I don't, either.
NOA: My throat is sore.
KANEDA: Uuuugh... Gimme some freakin' water!

	"Alright Sasami, I'll do it next time, how does that sound."

ALL: NECROPHILIA?! O_O NNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

	"Hmm... I didn't expect that to happen,

hmm... sunset already" said Yosho, as
he walked
down the stairs and out the sliding glass doors.

NOA: He was in the house, then?
AKANE: Don't ask. Just don't.
TWISTER: (whistles the Andy Griffith theme as Yosho walks out)

---

AKANE: Sasami's breasts.
KANEDA: Three of 'em?!
AKANE: ... I'm sorry.
NOA: It's okay. This fic is turning everybody stupid.

	"My dad is using a overused joke from an old video game, from awhile back.
Hmm.. maybe
he thought he was being cool or something, but I thought he should know that 
I
don't need him
to be cool, I need him to be in my ass," Tenchi thought to himself as he sat
under the shade
of a tree by the shrine.

ALL: (shake heads sadly)

	"Tenchi, you're forgetting something," said Micheal Jackson as he 
moonwalked
by, "you
still haven't delivered the roses yet."

ALL: _WHAT THE HELL?!_
TWISTER: All right, we're outta here!
OTHERS: Thank GOD!!
ALMIGHTY: Don't thank me. Thank Captain Twister.
ALL: ...
TWISTER: ... yes. RRRRRRUUUUNNNN!!
(All rush out of the exit at the back of the theater. They emerge...
back in the theater, the fic where it was.)
ALL: AAAAAAUUUUUGGH!!!
NOA: (To Twister) YOU HAVE TWO THEATERS?!
TWISTER: No. Look at the floor.
(All look at the floor. As it turns out, it is covered in vomit.)
ALL: EEEEwwww!
WASHU: (voice) I told you!
TWISTER: Lousy fic... lousy time and space warping...
(All sit down.)

	"Huh, Micheal!

NOA: Huuuh Michael!
AKANE: I don't think the author's found his question mark key, yet.

What are you doing here?"

KANEDA: Tenchi, he's Michael Jackson, and you are a teenage male.
ALL: WHAT DO YOU THINK?!

	"Oh, eheehee! Shamon!

TWISTER: (Tenchi) Speak unintelligible gibberish.

I'm just being used to advance the plot.

ALL: What plot?
AKANE: What was that about Nude Striker Tenchi?
TWISTER: Wasn't Tenchi supposed to be naked?
KANEDA: How did he, Noboyuki and Yosho have gay sex
with their clothes on?
NOA: Is the author trying to be stupid or just sick and perverted?
(All look at each other.)
ALL: (sobbing) WHY ARE WE THINKING ABOUT IIIIIIIIT?!

I have to leave
now!
Bubbles is on the magical rocketship, and is going to beam me up," said 
Micheal
as he was being
beamed up.

AKANE: I think that last scene proved one thing, at least.
OTHERS: What?
AKANE: The author is completely retarded.
TWISTER: ...I've created so many things, but that had to be
the first thesis I've heard that's correct beyond any shadow of a doubt.
AKANE: ^_^
TWISTER: Unfortunately.

	"Uh, okay, well, I should deliver these roses to Azaka and Kamadake," 
Tenchi
announced
while grabbing his crotch.

ALL: (close their eyes and sigh)

---

KANEDA: Very talented, to be able to count that high.

	"Azaka and Kamadake haven't come yet,

KANEDA: How can they?
AKANE: How can they what?
KANEDA: Cum.
AKANE: >_< (mallets Kaneda) *WHAAAM*
KANEDA: Sorry. That was a bad joke.

perhaps I should have delivered the roses
myself. I
mean, I knew that Tenchi would mess up, anyway, so why did I give them to 
him. I
just hope
that they can forgive me. Perhaps I should have left my clothes on as well,"
Yosho thought to
himself as he sat naked on a rock infront of the pond near the shrine, 
looking
at the red sky.

NOA: (Yosho) Why did my Viagra not have a label?

	Yosho was about to give up when he heard something move in the bushes, he
snapped his
head

ALL: YAY!

around to see Ryo-oh-ki moving caught in a bush.

ALL: Oh CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!

Yosho moved himself over
to get a closer
look at the entangled creature.

AKANE: You can see her JUST FINE!!
OTHERS: STOOOOOOP!!

Suddenly a horny thought came into Yosho's head.

ALL: NNNNNNOOOOOO!!

	"Hahaha, foolish creature, prepare for Yosho, master of love, to enter 
you!"
Yosho
proclaimed, moving his wrinkled hand down to Ryo-oh-ki's soft furry ass.

ALL: (They try to vomit. They really do. The fic is taking its toll.)

	"Miya!" cried out Ryo-oh-ki in startlement, but also in pleasure.

AKANE: She doesn't know what sex is. She'd be scared spitless.
Then... she'd turn into a spaceship and KILL YOSHO!!!
ALL: WAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!

---

NOA: The accumulated crud in the author's knowledge base.

	"Shit, Yosho's raping Ryo-oh-ki," said Ryoko, "but since, Yosho can kick my
ass, I'll
just let him rape away."

TWISTER: But you can beat him now.
KANEDA: How do you know?
TWISTER: (Holds up Tenchi Muyo Ultimate Edition)
OTHERS: Ohhhh...

	"Uh, okay Ryoko, just as long as you keep your juicy pussy down on my face 
you
can
do whatever you want." said Sasami.

ALL: ACK!
TWISTER: Forgot about that, there. -_-

---

ALL: Stuuupiiid...

	"Azaka..."

	"Kamadake..."

TWISTER: Greg! Jen!

	"Azaka..."

AKANE: Mila!

	"Kamadake..."

KANEDA: (Jinnai) MIZUHARAAAA!!

	"AZAKA!!!"

NOA: TETSUUUOOOO!!
KANEDA: HEY!

	"KAMADAKE!!!"

ALL: FREEEEEAK!!!

	"YOSHO!!!"

AKANE: CHIEF!!!

	"Kamadake?!?"

(All look at Twister)
TWISTER: ... What?

	"Oops, I meant to say Azaka..."

KANEDA: (ominous voice Azaka) Big mistake.

	"Get your branch out of me, it's obvious you don't love me anymore!"

ALL: o_O;;
AKANE: No "twig" jokes. Understand?
OTHERS: >_<

	"No, that's not true, please believe me Azaka!"

	"I don't know, maybe you'd rather be with Yosho!"

	"Stop it, please... I'll even let you stick your hard wood into me!"

ALL: (stunned stupid at the stupid pun.)

	"Well, okay, just never mention his name again when we do this together!"

	"Alright..ung..err...Azaka, oh yes Azaka!!!"

---

ALL: (hopeful) The end?!

	"Body sore with desire, ah the pain,
	the source of mystery, my ass looks bright red.
	I wish that someone will tell me, explain
	to me why, this crime, goes on near my bed."

ALL: ...
KANEDA: Uh, you're a retard. Does that help?

	"What!?! Lord Tenchi!" exclaimed Azaka, quickly pulling his wood out of
Kamadake.

NOA: Well, you know what they say.
AKANE: What, Noa?
NOA: Knock up wood! ^_^
OTHERS: (give Noa glare of promised death.)
NOA: Sorry. Baaaad joke.

	"Well, I thought I'd make up some crappy poetry while delivering these 
flowers
to
you guys," explained Tenchi.

TWISTER: (Tenchi) I put a lot of time and effort into writing crap.
Wanna see my new fic?

	Kamadake quickly turned around and read the label on the flowers, 
"Yosho...".

NOA: ... doesn't live here, anymore.

	"Kamadake, no it's a trick, he doesn't love you!" cried Azaka.

AKANE: (Azaka) All he ever did in the series was stay away from you!

	"Hmph, more like you've been tricking me all this time into believing he
doesn't!"

KANEDA: (Azaka) More like you should shut up!
NOA: (ditto) Alienboy52!

	"Uh... I don't understand what's happening," said Tenchi, his eyes wide, 
and
his brain
like normal, empty.

AKANE: NOTHING in this crap is normal!

	"Simple, Azaka has been trying to trick me into falling in love with him, 
when
he
knew all along that Yosho still truly loved me! Now I have to make ammends 
with
Yosho!" sharply
said Kamadake, trying his hardest to piece Azaka.

ALL: No sense, Kamidake, making, sentence i,n.
NOA: (blinks) How did you say that, Akane?

	"Well, then, if that's how you feel, then, go then, go to him!" cried 
Azaka.

TWISTER: Go away!

	Kamadake looked at Azaka for a second, and saw Azaka in a new light.

NOA: Does this fic even take the series into account?

He hovered
away
quickly, hoping to get to Yosho in time.

	"Hm... so Azaka, do you think you can help me out and tell me why my ass is 
so
sore?"
asked Tenchi.

ALL: (Azaka) Because you are on a plate of-
(they all stare at each other and go silent.)

	Azaka softy spoke, "Oh, yeah that... ahem... Yosho did it."

KANEDA: (Tenchi) Well, seeing as how I'm acting
completely stupid, I already knew that!

	"Of course! Why didn't I see it before!" exclaimed the newly enlightened
Tenchi.

NOA: (Tenchi) To indicate a question, you need a question MARK!
KANEDA: Bright boy.

	"Because you are on a plate of sashimi Tenchi," said a mysterious voice.

TWISTER: I have a feeling that line will come back to haunt us.
AKANE: Kill it.

	"Argh, you! Just shut up! I can't take that explaination anymore!" yelled
Tenchi.

TWISTER: You know, given Tenchi's mental state, I think he would have
killed himself to "stop the madness", so to speak.
OTHERS: (whispering) Do it. Do it. Do it!
TWISTER: You guys...
NOA: (whispering) Do the deed...

---

KANEDA: Uh, three negatives?

	"Alright Sasami, give it a try!" yelled Ryoko who had put her face directly
infront of
Sasami's asshole.

ALL: (Oh... my... God... NOOOOOO!) 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (YOU SICK FREAK!!!!)

	"Okay Ryoko, here it comes! Unnng!!" grunted Sasami as she concentrated on
pushing
with her lower intestine.

ALL: (passed out, but that last terrified scream goes for THAT line, as 
well.)

	Ryoko waited, her nose on Sasami's backbone, waiting for Sasami's little
surprise.

ALL: (recover and take a deep breath.) SON OF A (!!!)!!!!

Ryoko opened her mouth, hoping that something would come soon, something 
with a
taste that is
indescribible.

TWISTER: The author describes it pretty accurately,
though. We don't NEED him to, but he DOES!!
AKANE: This is... quite possibly... the SICKEST
scene in fanfiction history!
NOA: Maybe not... just maybe...

	"Ryoko, I'm sorry, I can't seem to get it to work," apologized Sasami.

TWISTER: (reaches up to the screen and grabs all the laxatives he can see)
*KABLOOIE!*
TWISTER: I DON'T CARE!!

	"Well what now?" asked Ryoko.

NOA: (Sasami) Well, we could act completely stupid and hentai.
AKANE: This isn't hentai. This is just depraved!

	"Hey there, don't despair! Washu is here to help out the lesbo pair!" 
exclaimed
Washu!

KANEDA: (exasperated) And Washu's the stupidest one of all!

	"Washu! Do you know how to help us out?" asked Sasami.

AKANE: (Fic Washu) Duuuuh, nope!

	"Easy, you see, an enema should clean out your bowels, and remove the waste
from your
lower intestine!" excitedly explained Washu.

TWISTER: For anyone who reads this, we don't REALLY consider
this a lemon, as there's nothing ressembling sex.
OTHERS: Who are you talking to?
ALMIGHTY: Me, and I agree. I agree with ALL of you.
ALL: .......................................................

	"Perfect! Quick hook me up," said Sasami.

NOA: (Washu) No. Finish your sentence.
KANEDA: (ditto) What's a sentence?
AKANE: Use an exclamation mark Kaneda.

	Ryoko smiled, she remebered childhood memories about how her mom used to 
give
her
enemas as a kid.

AKANE: I can think of at least EVERYTHING that's wrong with
that last line.
NOA: EVERYthing?
AKANE: ............ Yes!

Why, well she wasn't every sure, but Washu was a pervert after
all, maybe she
had a little girl fetish...

KANEDA: Well, like mother-
OTHERS: (mallet Kaneda) *WHAM* *WHAM *WHAM*!!!

	"Mom, don't you dare touch Sasami sexually, she's mine understand!" Ryoko
growled.

AKANE: (Alex Trebek) I'm sorry, you must phrase your
question in the form of a question.
TWISTER: (ditto) PREPARE TO DIE!!!
ALL: MWAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!

	"Eh, oh don't worry, I don't need Sasami to keep me company, when I've got 
her
sister,"
explained Washu.

ALL: Oh FUDGE CRACKLE!!

	"What! But I thought Ayeka was dead! Did you bring her back to life?" asked
Sasami.

TWISTER: No, she has to be a necrophile too.
ALL: *groan*

	"Actually, no, and I know what you're thinking Ryoko, and no I never had a
little girl
fetish. You see I'm actually a necrophilliac," Washu calmly stated.

TWISTER: Necrophiiiiiiile. Not "philliac"!
KANEDA: Dammit, I'm just not caring anymore.

	"Well I guess the princess' body can still be used for your 'experiments' I
suppose. But
that's not what's important, quickly tell me why you gave me enemas while I 
was
a kid,"
commanded Ryoko.

NOA: You're right Kaneda. This is just retarded now.
AKANE: It wasn't before?
NOA: Yes. Yes, it was. Now the fic comes full circle.

	"Don't talk to me in such a way dear, but it was actually because you
constantly needed
water pumped into your lower intestine to survive while you were a little 
one,
Ryoko," Washu
explained as she took out a hose from her bag.

ALL: Don't say BAG!!

----

ALL: ...
KANEDA: Where's the rest?

Alienboy 52

ALL: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!

Yayayayayayayayayayay!!! Seanbaby's #1 Fan!!!

NOA: Whoa, this is the work of a hyperactive hentai!
AKANE: A stupid one, too.
(All sit in silence for a minute)
ALL:................................................................
NOA: It's over.
AKANE: It's dead.
KANEDA: WE'RE ALIIIIIIIVE!!
TWISTER: GO NNNNOOOOWWWW!!!
(All get up to run out of the theater, but slip and fall down.)
TWISTER: (groans) Over the seats.
OTHERS: Yeah.
(All climb over the seats and exit the theater)
TWISTER: (offscreen) Now, where did I put the hose?

***************************************************************************
(Alienboy52 will NEVER get these from ANYBODY!)

	It had been a most fortunate occurence that Mihoshi had not been standing 
near
the door after the fic had ended.

*KA-BLAM!!*

The crew wore matching looks on their faces at Washu, who'd just appeared on 
the TV.

"Don't everyone look so happy at me at once," she said, upon seeing the 
identical looks
of non-impression. (-_- -_- -_- -_-)

	"Out," said Akane.

	"Of," said Twister.

	"Tolp," said Noa.

	"hole," said Noa.

Washu sweatdropped.

	"Pleeeease, Washu-chan?" Mihoshi asked.

Washu sighed. "Until I can figure out exactly HOW, I CAN'T! You're all okay, 
so deal
with it!"

	"Then, how are you getting through to us and dropping statues on Cap?!" 
Asked
Kaneda.

	"Tolp device," answered Washu. "I can't do a lot of the stuff I'd be able 
to do
in the series."

	"Who are you, SHIN Washu?" asked Akane.

*BOOM!*

	"Owwwww..." said Akane with a mini Lincoln Memorial on her head.

	"But, we're going bonkers! Coocoo!  LEMON MENTALITY!!!" Noa pointed out.

Surprisingly, Washu chuckled. This is Washu, so it wasn't so much a chuckle 
as it was
the roaring laughter of... something that's both chaotic and all-knowing.

	"Well, all you guys have to do to get rid of that is to MST the thing."

This suggestion, while being sound was met with a unanimous:

	"Murderize Stupid Tripe?"

Washu facefaulted.

	"Yeah, somethin' like that," she replied. "Actually, it's ALL like that. 
But, you
guys're new at this stuff, so you need practice."

	And with that, Washu typed on her holo-comp, disappearing from the screen. 
In a moment,
the screen was replaced with a certain television show from the early 90s...

	"Looks like a pretty low-budg deal," remarked Kaneda.

**************************************
THE HAMDINGER CREW SAYS:
**************************************

AKANE: NO redeeming qualities!  This fic is a pure, stinking
piece of crap! DON'T write another one like it!

NOA: What bothers me the most is that you went out of your way
to make this what it could have been: A gross-out. Instead, it was so stupid
and the "sex" was so... stupid, that all this is just a crapfest
that makes YOU look like an idiot. Not a pervert, just an idiot.

KANEDA: You could write this fic on toilet paper and nobody'd touch it!
This was all just a big "(...) you" to everybody who reads it. A lot of
our time was wasted here, and I hope we don't see sh*t like this again!
Get a goddamm clue!

CAPTAIN TWISTER: Well, this witless wad of clueless crap has effectively
wasted our time. But, being the fair and just leader that I am, I should
offer my advice on how fics like this can be improved. And here it is:

(Other crew members hold breath in anticipation.) *HUUUUUF*

CAPTAIN TWISTER: Delete all text. You've just done everyone the biggest 
favor
possible. Now EVERYONE can enjoy this fic. ^_^

OTHERS: *Exhale*

End theme: "The Lonely Moon"

AUTHOR'S NOTES
*****************

And thus, I do my duty as prereader. Here's my C&C, honest and unabridged!
Too harsh? ^_^

Now that my pet project's out of the way, I can relax for a bit. I have a 
big term
coming up, and some review would help. This earns my verdict for Stupidest 
Fanfiction
Ever, by the way. Oh, he'll probably finish it and make it even stupider. If 
it's
this quality, I don't know why anyone would bother to read it. I'll just 
have to MST
it again.

There you go. I can give an objective opinion, even in an MST! And yes, I 
will get around
to MSTing the rest of Needful Things. And as many others as I feel like 
doing.

Oh, and before I go: Happy belated birthday, Sakuya-Chan!! (President of the 
Tenchi
Enthusiasts Network. I said I'd dedicate an MST to her, and I was fully 
intent on
keeping that promise. ^_^)

As to everybody who read this MST, you can send all C&C to:

mistatwista@hotmail.com

As to Alienboy52... I don't like you. I didn't like this fic! You see, when 
I
volunteered to be a prereader, I expected something with a little higher 
quality
setting than your previous "work". You just seem to get worse as time wears 
on, and I could
just *kick* myself for thinking otherwise. (End sarcasm)It seems the only 
things you're good
at are writing crap... and reminding us all how much of an idiot you are.
And that's all you'll ever be remembered as. Maybe you should get your head 
out of somebody
else's ass and actually try to write something worth reading.

To all the rest, bon soir!
