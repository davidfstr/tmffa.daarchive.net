Blue Hair
By The Unknown DJ

(The Unknown DJ enters the stage with a brand new, green Ibanez, (It's
a guitar). He plugs into an amp. Also taking the stage are Tenchi,
Malice Stuckanovich, and Washu. Tenchi takes to the Mic, Malice grabs
his fender six string, (that would be a bass guitar), and Washu pulls
out a trumpet and drum machine.)

The Unknown DJ: Tonight's song is called, "Blue Hair." A Cake song
called, "Never There", inspired it.

(The band prepares to play and Tenchi opens his mouth to sing.)

Intro
I found out why I love so much,
I can't be so sure, so I guess it's just a hunch
You sit across the table,
And I turn red when I stare,
But, Ryoko, maybe, (maybe)
It is Your Hair!

Verse
It is so big and so scary,
That your head is blue and hairy,
You come in the house and strut it,
I hope to god you never cut it

Chorus
Blue Hair
It's your Blue Hair
It must be your Hair
(HEY)

Bridge
A small cow lick that stands up straight,
The way it can't be tame,
Ever since I saw your hair,
My life has never been the same
A small cow lick that stands up straight,
The way it can't be tame,
Ever since I saw your hair,
My life has never been the same

Repeat the Intro

Verse 2
Take the time to get to blow dry,
It turns me on and I don't know why,
If you want to be my girl,
Don't forget not to curl

Chorus
Your Blue Hair
Yes, your Blue Hair
It must be your hair
Your Blue Hair
Yes, your Blue Hair
It must be your hair
(HEY)
ENDZ

        That's my second song fic. The original can be found on the CD,
"Prolonging the Magic", by Cake. It is titled "Never There." If this
song doesn't make sense at all to you, well, I can't explain, (I don't
even know why I have the disc its self). In the middle of August on a
hot summer day, I was bored and thus this fic was born. E-mail whatever
