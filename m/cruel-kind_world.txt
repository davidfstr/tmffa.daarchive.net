Cruel and Kind World
         It was about three hours after dinner. Ayeka stood there still. So
still birds would have sat on her if she was outside. She turned slowly for
her room. When she got there she thought <Tenchi was kissing Ryoko>. She
locked her door and sat there with soft sobs coming from her. She didn't
know what to do now. Back on Jurai she would have to become the princess
that did everything her people asked of her. She wouldn't have all this
free time to do things she enjoyed. Then she realized that she was only
here because of Tenchi, but from what she just witnessed she just lost him.
She thought <There is no reason to stay. I will make preparations to
leave>. After wiping her eyes, she began to write letters to the household.
         "Ryoko what do you think your doing?!" said a surprised Tenchi.
         "I am merely proving our love! Don't you love me?"
         "Don't ask me that! I have no idea so stop bugging me about it!"
         "One day you will find out you love ME!" Ryoko said teleporting
happily away.
         "What will I do with all these women?" Tenchi wondered to himself
as he headed for his bedroom.
A few hours after everyone had headed off for bed, Ayeka called for a space
cab. Soon she left on a trip for Jurai.
         "Everybody wake up!" screamed Sasami.
There was no response. Everybody was too sleepy. Sasami read a note to
herself.

__________________________________________________________________________________
Dear Sasami,
         I am leaving for Jurai. I cannot tell you why. Do not be angry
with me. I do not expect you return anytime soon seeing that you like it
there on Earth. Come and visit me anytime you wish.

Love,
Ayeka

Ryoko thought<What is this> as she arose from her sleep finding a note on
her blanket.

__________________________________________________________________________________
Dear Ryoko,
         I hope your happy with Tenchi. The Tenchi that I thought would
someday be mine. I saw you both kiss. I know about you and Tenchi. Have a
happy life.

Sincerely,
Ayeka

         "My plan worked perfectly!" said Ryoko just in case someone was
near her room. She was really thinking <that idea of kissing him was
stupid. I chased away one of my friends. Wait, friend?> She began to think
about what she just thought.
         "What in subspace is this?" cried Washu.
___________________________________________________________________
Dear Washu (Little Washu),
         I sincerely enjoyed your company. Though your inventions weren't
always sane it was still fun with you around. I will truly miss you.
Sincerely,
Ayeka

Tenchi awoke to all the disturbance in the household only to find a tape
cassette popped into a player.
___________________________________________________________________
"Dear Tenchi,
         I am leaving for Jurai tonight. I saw you with Ryoko last night
and have a few things to say to you. First, I hope you have a happy life
with her, and second I...never..*sob*...needed you! I can make it without
anybody! After all I am going to be a queen someday. Goodbye.
With best of luck Ayeka."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Tenchi raced off to find Kiyone and Mihoshi.
         "What! Sure we will give you ride to find her. Hold on the phone
is ringing. Washu! Why are you calling? You located her? That's great!
We'll find her right now!" Kiyone exclaimed.
         "I guess the ride is free considering the space cab is broken,"
said the driver."I have to fix it."
         "How long will that take?" questioned Ayeka.
         "A couple days. Don't worry about it though. Every driver is
equipped with food and stuff just in case," he responded.
         "I'm going to go for a walk," Ayeka said and left.
She wandered off to a very remote part of the planet. It was really cold
and all the trees were all dead. She was terribly lost. She leaned against
a tree as First Love echoed through her mind.
Saigo kisu wa
Tabako no flavor ga shita
Nigakute setsunai kaori

Ashita no imagoro ni wa
Anata wa doko ni iru n' darou
Dare wo omotte 'ru n' darou

You are always going to be my love
Itsu ka dare ka to mata koi ni ochite mo
I'll remember how to love
You taught me how
You are always going to be the one
You are always going to be my love
Itsu ka dare ka to mata koi ni ochite mo
Ima wa mada kanashii love song
Atarashii uta utaeru made

Tachidomaru jikan ga
Ugoki-dasou to shite 'ru
Wasuretaku nai koto bakari

Ashita no imagoro ni wa
Watashi wa kitto naite 'ru
Anata wo omotte 'ru n' darou

You will always be inside my heart
Itsu mo anata dake no basho ga aru kara
I hope that I have a place in your heart too
Now and forever you are still the one
Ima wa mada kanashii love song
Atarashii uta utaeru made

You are always going to be my love
Itsu ka dare ka to mata koi ni ochite mo
I'll remember how to love
You taught me how
You are always going to be the one
Ima wa mada kanashii love song
Now and forever
"I think we're on the right planet," Kiyone said. "I'm going to stay here.
You go find her." Tenchi nodded furiously and left.
Ayeka sat there crying with that song repeating in her mind over and over
when Tenchi saw her.
Suddenly she yelled loudly,"I'm lost, I'm cold, I'm tired! How can this get
any worse?!"
He walked slowly and silently up to her and said,"Here. This jacket might
be a bit warmer." She recognized that voice. She was about to say,"Tenchi?"
and turn around, but a light kiss on the cheek made her freeze. His face
confronted hers and as he caressed her cheek he said gently and softly,
"Maybe you don't need me, but I do need you," and with that he kissed her
on the lips (that's right folks!).
The End (Or is it?)
Epilogue
         They told the cab driver that they were going to Earth and they
gave him a free ride back there. Ryoko apologized about what she had done.
As for Tenchi and a very happy Ayeka? They got married and had a kid named
Mayumi. Together Ayeka and Tenchi took the throne of Jurai and lived
happily ever after.
