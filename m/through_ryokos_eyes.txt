         Through Ryoko's Eyes
            By Ryo Masiki

     I've been through a living hell
     Under the control of Kagato
     There is nothing that will make me well
     Torn from my childhood
     Forced to grow up too soon
     I fall...
     Falling...just falling...into darkness
     Defeated by a great Juiran Knight
     Trapped away in a cave,
     Never to see light again.
     Time passes by without a care
     Someone comes..a young man
     Releasing me from my prision.
     Hate...Anger...released along with me
     He is none other then a Juiran.
     I try to kill...destory him..but I fail
     I begin to fall into new feelings.
     Come to love a man named 'Heaven and Earth'
     Kagato returns to claim his prize
     Pain...My pain has returned
     My love is gone..
     Replaced by hate
     Kagato controls over me once again
     My prince, he comes to me
     And sets me free
     I'll wait forever
     And a day
     Just to hear
     Him say
     The three little words I long to hear
     Until he does,
     I tease and sudece
     Annoying my rivals in love
     If he ever finds another
     I promise to leave for good
     Back to my hell
     Reliving my past
     Once more.
     Heaven and Earth
     My heart belongs to you
     Only you.
     My beloved Tenchi

Ryoko put the notebook down beside her.
"I just wish I could really tell him...." She trails
off into her dreams.

    *The End*
