An MST by Steve

(Thought you might like to know this is my first MST.)

All the characters depicted in this story are of my own creation with
the
following exceptions:

      Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Psychotic killer created by the one
and only Jhonen Vasquez.
      Crow T. Robot: That lovable golden robot from the "MST3K" TV show.

These are my original Characters:

 Sharrin Bowman: An oppressed fifteen-year-old goth/skater female
featured in a book I wrote entitled "Frogs 2: Toads".
 Psycho Steve: Pretty much a self insertion into the story.  Psycho
Steve is one of the nicknames I am known under.  Others include Evil
Steve,Whisper, and White Steve.
 Till: A seven-foot-tall German Dragon named after Rammstein's
vocalist.  This Character is featured in a sort of Quentin Tarintino
meets Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy my step-brother Andy and I came up
with.
 Nastica: Till's girlfriend who appears in the third installment of the
trilogy. Originally a dragon as well (a Russian one for a particualr
reason) was later transformed into an American 100% human goth chick.
Hey, I have a fetish for gothic girls, sue me.

These six brave souls have been forced to view really bad fanfics by
satanic stringbeans that came out of hell after Till agreed to sell his
soul to them for a gallon of vodka.  Afterwards realizing what a stupid
thing he had done Till would not give the stringbeans his soul.  The
stringbeans made a compromise, however.  If he and his friends viewed
one bad fanfic a day they would not torture and kill all of them.  The
stringbeans have set up a movie theater inside the dwelling of the six
unfortunate souls.  Only fanfics can be viewed in this theater,
however.  A certain time every day they will all be forced into the
theater to view the fic of the day.  Resistance to comply will result in
immediate death.  So begins the MST.

The whole crew sits at a card table playing Magic the Gathering.  Till
looks at Johnny.
TILL: (sternly) Your move.
Johnny grins evilly and draws a card.  He is playing with a white deck.
Johnny taps four of his plains.  There is a moment of pause.  Johnny
then suddenly throws down a Wrath of God.
JOHNNY: (very loud voice) All your creatures are dead, dead, DEAD!  Hoo
Hah!
Everyone else groans in disappointment as they take all their creatures
from play and toss them into their graveyard piles.
SHARRIN: Damn, I hate when you pull out that freaking card.
Johnny then laughs hysterically and also very loudly.
SATANIC STRINGBEAN: (from over intercom) Attention!  Attention!  Abandon
whatever you are doing now and report to the theater for today's fanfic.
It's called "Euphoria".
Everyone groans in dismay.
NASTICA: (heading towards theater) Okay, let's get this over with.
Everyone else follows into the theater and takes their seats.

others I will

<CROW: Burn in hell.>
<STEVE: Never write a lemon again.>
<JOHNNY: Cut my face off and eat it.>

suggestions are welcome
                 also.

<CROW: I have a feeling that my comments will be far from welcome.>

And now on to the story....

<SHARRIN: No! No! Quick, somebody try and stall him!>

 The day began as any other day, but today was no ordinary day for
Ryouko.

<SHARRIN: Damn, too late, it started.>
<STEVE: Bastard, that's not how "Ryoko" is spelled.>

She was
had a lot in store for Tenchi so that he would be hers forever.

<NASTICA: Right off the bat I have a problem with where this is headed.>

 She left the house shortly
after lunch and told everyone that she wouldn't be back until late in
the night.  Everyone
naturally assumed that she had gone on a date with some other man after
getting tired of
pursuing Tenchi.

<CROW: (sarcasm clearly present) Yeah, I'm so sure that would happen in
this lifetime.>

Ayeka thought that she would take advantage of the situation by making
a romantic dinner that would capture Tenchi's heart and make him notice
her.

<NASTICA: (as Tenchi) Oh, Ayeka, you made me food, I love you now! (Back
to normal voice) Please, gimme a break, guys don't appreciate stuff like
that.>

What nobody
didn't know

<STEVE: Hey, hey, double negative, buddy.>

was that Ryouko hadn't actually left the house but was secretly sitting
in the
basement to wait for the right time.

<CROW: The right time for what? Hell, let's just not tell the audience
anything.>
<JOHNNY: I'm pretty sure that's what this guy was planning.>
<SHARRIN: Yeah. Basically screw the story and get onto the hentai
material as soon as possible.>

      Ayeka cooked two separate dinners, one for Tenchi and herself and
one for everyone else.

<TILL: Okay. She cooked two dinners, one for herself and one for Tenchi,
and magically wound up with extra dinners for everyone else. That's more
than two.>

Ayeka also set up another table in a separate room, away from everyone
else so they wouldn't
be interrupted.  Everyone came to the table sat down, and began the
meal.  Ryouko turned
intangible so that she was now able to come up through the floor.

<CROW: Wow, did you hear that? He actually used a vocabulary word in a
lemon.>
<ALL: Wow.>

 After poking her head

<JOHNNY: With a stick...>

through the floor

<JOHNNY: Oh.>

she saw that neither Tenchi nor Ayeka were at the table
or Ayeka at the table anywhere.

<SHARRIN: Wow, that was an extremely awkward sentence.>

 "That wench, Ayeka, she took MY Tenchi"

<NASTICA: (as Ryoko) I bought my copy of Tenchi fair and square!>

exclaimed Ryouko "I hope she's not planning
to take MY Tenchi away from me because he's MINE.

<CROW: Damn, did Tenchi sign a contract to let Ryoko purchase him or
something? Ryoko seems to be incredibly possessive of him there.>

"If I find that she's with MY Tenchi
I'll give her a beating that she'll never forget.  Maybe then she'll
learn not to steal
my man, ever again.

 Ryouko sunk back under the floor to continue her search for Tenchi.

<CROW: Why would he be in the floor?>
<JOHNNY: I hide people in the floorboards sometimes, too.>

The first place
she check was the bedrooms but found that they weren't there, which
greatly relieved Ryouko.
She finally found them in a dark, secluded room that was connected to
Ayeka's bedroom that
only Ayeka had access to, until now.

<STEVE: What, does the room require a secuirty passcode that only Ayeka
knows?>

 Ryouko came up through the floor, under the table and
crouched under it.  She became solid again and was careful not to alert
Ayeka of her presence.

<CROW: Then she turned liquid, gas, semisolid, and then back to solid
again.>

Luckily Ayeka had used a long tablecloth that reached the floor so she
wouldn't be interrupted
from her plans.  Slowly she knelt in front of Tenchi but didn't touch
him yet, she had to
carefully plan this so that Tenchi wouldn't be too alarmed so that she
wouldn't alert anyone of
her position.

<SHARRIN: (as Ryoko) I'm in position, Alpha Team move in.>
<STEVE: Tengo down.>
<SHARRIN: (to Steve) Don't start with that.>
<STEVE: (to Sharrin) Okay.>

 After much thoughtful planning she brought her plans up to Tenchi's lap
and lightly caressed
the front of Tenchi's pants.

<TILL: That's her careful plan after much thoughtful planning?>
<JOHNNY: A tube sock could've thought of a more elaborate plan than
that.>

Tenchi looked up at Ayeka at turned a bright shade of red.

<CROW: The animator must have spilled some red ink on him.>

 "Oh Tenchi did I make your food too spicy for you?" inquired Ayeka

<CROW: Wow, vocab word number two.>

 Tenchi shook his head and returned to his meal trying not to give
anything else away.

<STEVE: Like the ending to Cast Away. Oh wait, the previews did that
already, nevermind.>

Ryouko paused for a moment to see if Tenchi had given away her position.

<NASTICA: (as Ryoko) Hey Tenchi, did you give away my postition? Wait,
shit!>

After a couple seconds
she continued to caress Tenchi's slowly hardening pole.

<JOHNNY: Why the hell did he stick a pole in his pants?>
<TILL: Your guess is as good as mine.>

Soon Tenchi's dick was at full mast and
bloated with blood.

<STEVE: My GOD, that's unpleasant.>

 His prick was becoming sore so Ryouko decided to undo his pants for
him.  She
was almost hit in the face as his full length came flying straight at
her face.

<CROW: Did his weiner just suddenly fly off at her or something?>

Ryouko caught
the bloated shaft at the base with her left hand and softly started to
run her fingers up and down
his entire length.

<SHARRIN: Which took about half a second both ways.>

Tenchi tried hard not to moan, whimper or start breathing heavy as it
would
give away what was going on and he definitely didn't want this to stop.

<TILL: But we do, is there anything we can do?>
<STEVE: (yelling at the screen) Hey, Ayeka! Look under the table!>
<NASTICA: (also yelling at screen) Yeah!>

The danger of the situation
was very arousing for Tenchi.  In an effort to release the tension,
Tenchi curled his toes upwards.

<CROW: Yeah, okay, so it seems that our Tenchi is triple jointed.>

He accidentally stuck his toe of his shoe into Ryouko's groin.
Ryouko was surprised at this and
started to take her plan further.

 Ryouko once again turned intangible and sunk back trough the floor.

<STEVE: Oh, her plan is to leave right in the middle of it all.>
<SHARRIN: That's a pretty lame plan.>
<TILL: Well, it's a pretty lame lemon.>
<SHARRIN: True.>

 "No, please don't leave me now, not when it was just getting good."
Tenchi thought to himself

<JOHNNY: Unfortunately he thought it out loud like The Maxx.>
<CROW: (as Tenchi) D'oh!>

 Once in the basement Ryouko stripped herself of all her clothing but
hadn't yet become solid.

<SHARRIN: So when she becomes solid do her clothes remain intangible or
do they revert back to their normal form?>
<JOHNNY: How the fuck should we know?>
<TILL: The author probably doesn't know either, he just wants to get
Ryoko naked as soon as possible.>
<CROW: Can't really blame him, though.>
<TILL: Yeah, I'll give him that.>

When she was totally naked, she returned to the underside of the table
and resumed her caresses on
Tenchi's upright dick.  Tenchi exhaled a sigh of relief and contentment,
Ayeka congratulated herself
on her meal as she thought Tenchi was merely enjoying the meal.

<STEVE: There's a mouthful of a sentence.>

  After Ryouko was sure that Tenchi was
completely aroused, she slowly licked the underside of Tenchi's
cockhead.

<TILL: No. Penis go away.>

Tenchi fought desperately
to hold in his moans of pleasure.

 Tenchi knew what Ryouko was thinking and removed his shoe and sock off
of his right foot.

<SHARRIN: Tenchi apparently has a psychic link to Ryoko.>
<CROW: Wait, Ayeka doesn't grow suspiscious at all when Tenchi takes of
one of his shoes without an apparent explanation in the middle of
dinner?>

He once
again stuck his foot back into Ryouko's groin and started to massage her
swollen clit with his big toe.

<NASTICA: Did something happen to her clit that we didn't find out
about? Or did it just suddenly get swolen for no reason?>
<CROW: Don't ask don't tell I guess.>

Ryouko pushed downward with all her weight and forced Tenchi's toe into
her love-canal.

<STEVE: There's a really strange and ineffective sexual position right
there.>

 Tenchi began to
move his toe around within Ryouko's womanly depths.  Ryouko began to
suck wildly on Tenchi's throbbing
cock as Tenchi's half-kicked his foot upwards in an effort to get more
of his toe inside Ryouko.

<TILL: Wow, Ayeka must be on one hell of a space-out to not notice
Tenchi's random spastic kicking and the hot naked chick under the
table.>
<SHARRIN: Not to mention all the squishy and slurpy noises.>
<ALL: (cringing) Uuuuugggh...

Ryouko
swirled her tongue around the head as a way of thanking Tenchi.

<CROW: Thanking him for what, well, no one knows.>

  She moved her hips up and down in the same
rhythm as Tenchi's upward strokes.  Ryouko bobbed her head down
everytime that Tenchi's foot came up and
pushed down with her cunt lips in an effort to swallow Tenchi's toe.

<JOHNNY: Yum, toe.>

 Meanwhile everyone had finished their dinner and had gone about their
regular activities.  Washuu was

<SHARRIN: Spelled with one 'u'...>

in her lab.  Sasami and Ryo-ohki were off playing outside as they always
do.

<STEVE: Hopefully not in the carrot patch.>
<TILL: Let's not mention that stroy ever again.>
<STEVE: Okay.>

But, Ayeka was eating as slowly
as possible in an effort to savor her time with Tenchi.

 "Why aren't you eating your dinner Tenchi?"  Ayeka asked inquisitively,

<NASTICA: You can't ask something inquisitively, to inquire is to ask,
and to say that you are inquisitively asking something is to suggest
that there is a means of asking which does not require inquisition, but
that is impossible, for the two words mean basically the same thing. So
that is sort of like a double positive, if there is such a thing.>
<TILL: (looking at Nastica) Ya through?>
<NASTICA: Yup.>

 "Don't you like the meal that
I made for you?"

<JOHNNY: Well, I can't really say that I'm fond of goat shit tacos.>

 Tenchi scooped up some of what was on his plate with his fork and
swallowed it.  He followed it up with
a weak smile to make dissipate Ayeka's suspicions.

<CROW: Yeah, kicking randomly under the table, having looks of ecstacy
upon your face, quickly gobbling up small amounts of food and giving
fake smiles just erases her suspicions, doesn't it?>

It didn't work however, as she was beginning to suspect
something was wrong.

<CROW: Oh, okay.>

 "Oh, yes!!!  Here it comes, I'm gonna cum straight down Ryouko's sweet
throat" thought Tenchi.  He
put everything he had into bringing Ryouko over the edge of orgasm also.

<SHARRIN: Uh oh, not a good idea to give someone an orgasm when they're
trying to keep a low profile.>

Tenchi increased his pace without
making it obvious.  Under the table, Ryouko's head was bobbing madly up
and down on Tenchi's fully aroused
prick.  Tenchi brought his hands down to his lap and placed them on the
back of Ryouko's head.

<ALL: (laughing)>
<STEVE: Yeah, that's not suspicious or anything.>

He brought
Ryouko's head down faster and harder on his dick.

<TILL: Which he would have to be moving his arms pretty wildly to do so,
which would blow his cover...>

He felt  the head of his cock hitting Ryouko's the back
of Ryouko's throat.

<JOHNNY: Wow, really awkward sentence structure there.>
<CROW: I guess he really wants to get the idea across that it's Ryoko's
throat.>

Finally Ryouko rammed her lips down to the base of Tenchi's hard cock
and savored the
flavor of Tenchi's sweet jizz.

<CROW: (disoriented voice) Oh god, I feel nausious.>

At the same time, Tenchi kicked his foot up and lifted Ryouko up off the

floor with one foot and jammed his foot as deep as he could into
Ryouko's dripping cunt.

<ALL: WHAT?!?!>
<NASTICA: Okay, okay, let me get this straight. Tenchi lifted Ryoko
completely off the floor with just his toe. And while doing this Ayeka
didn't notice at all that the table just flew up into the air and back
down again. (giving up tone) I just don't...>

She tightened her
lips around Tenchi's huge dick and barely managed to keep all of his cum
in her mouth, without spilling any of it.
Ryouko let it sit for a while and then swallowed it slowly so she could
feel it slipping down into her throat
and into her stomach.

<CROW: (vomits) Oh God, WHY?!>

 Ryouko put Tenchi's sock and shoe back on, then sunk back into the
basement where she got herself
dressed again.  She then teleported herself outside and acted as if she
had just arrived home from the perfect
date with the perfect man.

<SHARRIN: (as Ryoko) Hi everyone. Just fucked Tenchi; oh shit!>

 After cleaning up all the dishes from dinner, Ayeka turned her
attention to Tenchi.

<STEVE: (as Ayeka) Did you really think that I didn't know you were
fucking Ryoko at dinner?>

 "Are you alright, Tenchi?"  inquired Ayeka "You were acting very
strangely during dinner and I think
you might be coming down with something."

<CROW: Oh, he came alright.>
<TILL: Eeeew, Crow.>
<CROW: What?>

She put her hand to Tenchi's forehead, but felt nothing strange.
"Maybe you're feeling lonely because Ryouko  left you tonight.  Well you
can forget about that slut, because
I'm the one that really loves you.  Forget about that slut, she left for
her own personal needs without a
second thought."

<JOHNNY: (as Ayeka) By the way, forget about that slut.>

 Ayeka closed her door and then turned around and gave Tenchi a lust
filled gaze.

<TILL: A something filled gaze, anyway.>

She began to
bring herself closer to Tenchi's body and pressed herself softly against
him.  She rubbed the tips of her
tits against Tenchi's chest until her nipples became fully erect and
were visible
through her kimono.  Tenchi couldn't help but look down Ayeka's kimono
as he hugged her close to him.  His
dick raised up and poked Ayeka in the stomach.

<STEVE: At this point you have to admit that Tenchi is a bigger slut
than any of the females here.>

 "Oh, Tenchi!" exclaimed Ayeka "are you getting turned on due to my
actions?"

<ALL: (laughing Hysterically)
<TILL: (as Tenchi) Well I was until you said THAT!>
<SHARRIN: That Ayeka's a real sweet talker ain't she?

 This wasn't one of the  questions that she was going to let Tenchi
answer.

<JOHNNY: We'll get to the questions she will let him answer later.>

Ayeka reached out and
began to slowly stroke the front of Tenchi's slacks with her right hand.

<NASTICA: But Tenchi's already drained.>
<STEVE: Shhhhh! Ayeka doesn't know that.>

With her left hand Ayeka reached for
Tenchi's zipper and brought it down slowly so that it made a long
buzzing sound.

<JOHNNY: Whoops, there must've been a nest of bees in there.>

Tenchi brought both of his
hands to Ayeka's shoulders and slid her kimono down off of her
shoulders.  Tenchi found that Ayeka had planned
all of this by the fact that she wore no bra and was completely bare
under her kimono.  Tenchi let the top half
of Ayeka's kimono hang down and brought his hands to Ayeka's fleshy
breasts.

<CROW: How else would they be?>
<SHARRIN: ...bony?>
<CROW: Ick! I'm sorry I asked!>

He gently kneaded the flesh that
was Ayeka's tits.

<NASTICA: This fanfic can kiss the flesh that is my ASS!>

He started around the soft edges and worked his way in towards her erect
nipples that stood out
a full half-inch from the rest of her tit.

<JOHNNY: Wow, those things are dangerous.>
<STEVE: You could poke someone's eye out with those things.>

Ayeka began to moan audibly as the sensations ran from her nipples
from her nipples to her sensitive clitoris.

<TILL: So the sensation went from her nipples to her nipples, and by
some God forseen act, to her clit. Anyone care to explain that?>
<STEVE: Ya got me.>

Tenchi took each nipple between a thumb and a finger and began to
rub it back and forth between them.  He leaned forward and took one into
his mouth, Tenchi ran a lap around the
sensitive nipple with his tongue.

<CROW: (announcer type voice) And tongue is in the lead after the first
lap with teeth and gums not too far behind.>

Then he took the fully erect nipple between his teeth and began to
nibble on
it slightly, while nibbling he kept licking the tip with the end of his
tongue.

<TILL: ...Is that possible?>
<NASTICA: Very doubtful.>
<TILL: Oh.>

 Ayeka slipped Tenchi's full cock out through the fly in Tenchi's
pants.  It stood out a full eight inches
from his hips.  Ayeka was mesmerized by its length and width that she
never knew possible.

<STEVE: Neither did we!>

She kneeled down on the
ground in front of Tenchi and pulled him down onto her mattress with
her.  Tenchi lay down on the bed to see what
she was going to do.  Ayeka was at his feet, kneeling at the edge of the
bed.  She undid the button on his pants and
pulled them off his muscular legs,

<ALL: (Laughing)>
<CROW: Muscular?! Is that what it said?!>
<JOHNNY: I believe so.>
<CROW: But...ah, screw it.>

and gracefully threw them into a corner of the room.

<NASTICA: Is it possible for something to be tossed into a corner with
grace?>
<SHARRIN: Well, it's not completely inpossible. But people usually don't
try to use grace when taking off someone's clothes for sex, so I'd say
'no' in this situation.>

Tenchi took of his shirt

<JOHNNY: You mean to he took "off" his shirt, not "of".>
<STEVE: C'mon, let's not rag on the typos unless they're real bad.>
<JOHNNY: Okay.>

and threw it into another corner of the room.  Ayeka crawled forward so
that she had her soft lips positioned
above Tenchi's upright dick.  She licked all around the tip, lubricating
it with her saliva.

<CROW: Uuugggh...>

She bobbed her head
down all the way to the base a couple of times so that the entire thing
was lubricated up.

<TILL: For God's sake, just use lubricant! Save us our stomachs.>
<SHARRIN: It isn't really bothering Nastica and I much.>
<TILL: (to Sharrin) That's because you're chicks!
<NASTICA: (to Till) Ha ha.>

Ayeka stood up on her
knees and walked forward until she was directly above Tenchi's cock.
Tenchi placed his hands upon her hips and
looked deep into her eyes.

<JOHNNY: So deep that he could see her brain through them.>

He could tell that she wanted him badly because her womanly moisture was
dripping down
and lubing his dick even more.

<JOHNNY: Even if she didn't want him there would be vaginal fluid
dripping down anyways, so how can he tell by that?>

They both smiled at each other which signaled that they were both
ready.  Tenchi
forced Ayeka's hips down as she dropped all of her weight downwards.

<CROW: Unfortunately she had just turned into a 300 pound woman named
Bertha somehow, so Tenchi was flattened and killed, and the fanfic's
over now.>
<STEVE: We only wish.>

Tenchi's huge prick drove deep into Ayeka's
warm depths.  Tenchi pulled down until Ayeka's pussy lips had come all
the way down to the very base of his manhood.

<STEVE: You know at this point I'd like to point out that this i
supposed to be the sequel to "At the Carrot Patch" and yet these two
stories have absolutely NOTHING do do with each other.>

He held Ayeka down so that they could both enjoy the pleasure of their
first sexual experience together.

<SHARRIN: Wouldn't they have shared it anyway? What, was Ayeka going to
float away if Tenchi didn't hold her down, or something?>

Tenchi
pushed up on Ayeka's hips, her cunt made a delightful squishing sound as
Tenchi penetrated her pussy.

<JOHNNY: Sort of like the squishing of a human head under a sledge
hammer.>
<TILL: (to Johnny) You would know about that stuff, wouldn't you?>
<JOHNNY: (to Till) Of course. Read issue number seven, I do it in that
one.>

He stuffed
himself into her inch by inch.

<STEVE: Wow! Tenchi's a contortionist!>

 Once he had totally buried his meat inside his lover's hole, he brought
her back up
so that just the head of his dick was left inside her, slowly brought
her back down to the very base of his dick.

<STEVE: Didn't he use that move in "At the carrot patch"?>
<TILL: A few things from that have been recycled and thrown into this
one.>
<CROW: It's probably a good thing I didn't see that fic, isn't it?>
<STEVE: Oh, yes it is.>

 Oh! Dearest Tenchi, you feel so good inside me.  Pump you dick into me
harder, faster, oh yes!!  Doesn't
this make you feel better after that wench, Ryouko, left you for another
man?

<CROW: Hey, she forgot to put quotation marks around her speech.>

 Ayeka began to raise and lower herself on Tenchi's cock faster and
faster until they both had gotten into
a pounding rhythm.

<CROW: Unfortunately they're Jewish, so they have no rythm.>
<TILL: (to Crow) Better watch it with those kind of remarks.>
<CROW: (to Till) What? I heard it on "South Park".>

Tenchi looked up and saw Ayeka's tits flopping up and down in front of
his face.

<SHARRIN: Bounce, bounce, bounce...>

He couldn't
resist, so he reached up with both hands and grabbed them.  He pinched
both nipples and began rolling them between
his fingers.

<STEVE: Hey, detatchable nipples, that's nifty.>

He leaned forward and buried his face between Ayeka's beautiful, round
tits.

<JOHNNY: What other shape would they be?>
<NASTICA: Rectangular, maybe.>

Tenchi rubbed his face
up and down between her tits, trying to get more of that wonderful,
musky odor into his nostrils.

<SHARRIN: Hey, how come my tits don't smell like musk?>
<CROW: I guess she put on some musk perfume prior to sex.>

Tenchi licked
the flesh between the fleshy mounds.  He pressed both of her pert
breasts together close enough so her could get
both nipples in his mouth at the same time.

<STEVE: There's the detatchable nipples again.>

Tenchi bit them gently between his front teeth to keep them in his
mouth, at the same time he tugged on them slightly.  He began to flick
his tongue across the both of her nipples.
Ayeka moaned out loud

<NASTICA: Of course no one else in the house hears any of this.>

and continued to pound herself on to Tenchi's slick meat.

<JOHNNY: Is she getting her self off from Tenchi's cheese burger or
something?>
<CROW: I'm thinking along the lines of his Rib Jr. sandwitch.>
<TILL: ...Oh, I get it...meat.>
<STEVE: (to Till) Yeah, Till.>

 "Damn, your cunt is so tight Ayeka!" Tenchi managed to moan

<CROW: Yup, just managed to speak those seven words. It was a hell of an
effort but he pulled it off.>

 Tenchi grabbed either side of his lovers' hips to slow her down as they
both approached orgasm.  Finally
Tenchi rammed his cock as far as it would go into Ayeka's warm depths as
he shot his searing load of jizz up into
her womb.

<NASTICA: (as Ayeka) AAAAAAH! Your jizz scalded my clit!>

Her cunt muscles contracted in an effort to milk the cum out of his
balls.

<CROW: Oh God, can vaginal muscles actually do that?>
<NASTICA: I'm damn sure mine don't.>

 "Thank you Tenchi, you have proven to me how much you love me.

<STEVE: (as Ayeka) Yes, eating two bites of the meal I made you and
fucking me has proved that you love me, even though 60% of sex that goes
on in the world today is completely meaningless.>

Now Ryouko can't take you away from me,
ever!

<JOHNNY: How much do you wanna bet that Ryoko fucks Tenchi the next
day?>
<TILL: $100!>
<SHARRIN: $500!>
<CROW: $1000!>

You belong to me now.

<NASTICA: (as Ayeka) Remember that contract I made you sign?>
<TILL: (as Tenchi) Ohhhhh...>

But for now you must rest.  From the way you were acting earlier on in
the evening,
I'd say you were sick.  I'll be back to check on you later, to see that

Well, that's all I have this time around.  If I can get enough ideas for
a part 3 I'll do it.

<JOHNNY: I've got some ideas to send him alright...>

If not I'll try doing
another series.

<STEVE: Keyword here; "try".>

Stay tuned and feel free to send your comments and/ or ideas to
Mike_Forever@hotmail.com.

<STEVE: Well, it's better than "At the Carrot Patch". I'll give him
that.>
<TILL: Then again that isn't really saying much.>
<STEVE: True. Come on, let's get outta here.>
