MSTers's note:Since we are MSTing a Tenchi fic and the Tenchi cast
are MSTing The<> sign are the MST characters.

In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki, who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!
Ryoko:Yes way!
Ayeka:I can smell the woodsmoke on you.
Mihoshi:My hotdog has a first name, it's K-I-O-N-E. . .
Washu:But wait! There's more!
Kione:Never eat a taco that's bigger than your head.
Sasami:I have no purpose on this show. Oh well.
Ryo-ohki:MEOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
If you are wondering how they eat or breathe, or other science facts,
Repeat to yourself it's just a fic and you really should relax,
For Tenchi-Muyo theater 4000
TTTTTTTTTTWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG.

::They're all just sitting around eating food. Then Clay calls them::
<Clay>Hello stupid people! Here's a fic! Bye!
::Clay disappears::
<Ryoko>Oh well.
::Sasami, Kione, and Ryoko go into the theatre::

The Slumber Party- Revised
By:TRJamesGal14

This is my first Tenchi fic, so don't kill me.
Crossover with Pokemon and Sailor Moon.

<Sasami>We've had some bad experiences with cross overs...
<Ryoko>We've had some bad experiences with this author.

With me in the mix.
Note: This fic was writen on the shere moment. Kay!!! DON"T TRUST THE
RATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

______________________________________________________________________________

Sorry. I suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Kione>Ain't that the truth

Okay here is the rewrite of the other Slumber Party! Okay

"Jessie!" James whined walking down the hall , he was getting dressed
while walking down
the hall. Ryoko was doing the same while wal;king down the hall
following him. "Jessie!"
James was so smashed

<Sasami>To pieces by Jessie. She always beats him, the sadist she is.
<Ryoko>Sasami?
<Sasami>Yes?
<Kione>Have you experience with Jessie's sadism?
<Sasami>....no....

that he didn't even think about trying to hide sleeping with Ryoko

<Ryoko>AHHHHHHHHHH! Why God why?

secret, or at least not public news.

<Sasami>(Newscaster) Yes tonight on the public news: James and Ryoko get
it on like two rabbits in springtime!
::Ryoko hits Sasami lightly::

TRJ walked down the hall in her robe, looking for
James."Now if I catch him right before he hits the shower, then I'll be
in heaven."

<Ryoko>Ewww! Who'd wanna see him nude???
<Kione>This author. I mean look at her pen name!
<Sasami>Yeah. She's probably masturbating to the thought of it.
<Ryoko>And what would you know about that?
<Sasami>Get real.

She clicked the flash for her camera on when..."OH MY
GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" James was in full makeout with
Ryoko and was pulling off her shirt.

<Ryoko>::covers eyes:: tell me when its over......
<Kione>Wait... who is TRJ if James is making out with Ryoko? Jessie?
<Sasami>Nah..Probably a self insertion.

There was alot of giggling going on in the hallway.

<Kione>And a lot of puking from Ryoko in the theater.
<Sasami>::Looks down:: Oh yeah... eww.
<Ryoko>Hey, if you were paired with an incompetent criminal, you'd be
puking too. He is a disgrace to all of us! He can't even capture a
stupid electric rat!
<Kione>Okay, whatever.

TRJ took more shots of James and Ryoko

<Kione>They mean shots of himself and Ryoko.
<Ryoko>Hey. We aren't sure about that.

in their "senstive" moment. She went down the hall to see Nobuoki or
whatever, Tenchi's
Dad, kissing Jessie's neck.

<Sasami>After reading other fics, you can see that Nobiyuki wouldn't
mind that...
<Ryoko>Wait, Kione is right. Who is TRJ if Jessie and James are both
doing it?
<Sasami>I told you! A self insertion!
<Kione>Just seems like bad writing to me.

"Oh, this is SOO goood!!!" TRJ whispers taking as many snapshots
as her camera will allow. "Oh, man, I didn't know that Jessie could bend
like that?"TRJ
snapped a few more shots. "There must be something else to do. Ah, the
Sailor Scouts!"

<Sasami>Ooh! The female Tenchis again! Hehehe Ryoko! (See previous MST,
Oops I did it again-MSTed)
<Ryoko>Oh, yeah, those guys, I mean, girls.

"I didn't know that they liked!

<Ryoko>Lesbian sex?
<Kione>That show with Eddie Murphy dressed up as a giant Gumby?
<Sasami>Guess we'll never know, since she never finished the sentence.

Oh, well more blackmail pics for me!" Snapping all the girls

<Kione>Brastraps
<Ryoko>You'd like that, huh Kione?
<Kione>Shut up.

except Washu,Sasami, Renne, and Serena kissing with Tuxedo Mask.

"La, La, La. Oh, cool!" TRJ walks into the lab. A portal stands there
open with Meowth,
Washu, Sasami, Renne, with Reo-Oki,

<Ryoko>Who is Reo-Oki?
<Sasami>Oh! You didn't know?
<Ryoko>...no, what?
<Sasami>Ken-Ohki and Ryo-Ohki had a baby! They named her Reo-Oki!
<Kione>(Playing along) Yeah. Nagi set them up, too. It was cute.
<Ryoko>WHAT!? Ooh! I'll get that Nagi if- wait, you're joking, right?
<Sasami>Yes. Yes we are.

in front of it. "Hey have you guys seen Tenchi and
Serena?" They all point upstairs. "They left the house for a
picnic...yesterday."

<Kione>Ooh! That Serena is a playah!
<Ryoko>If she even put her stupid moon hands on my Tenchi I'll kill
her!
<Sasami>But Ryoko! She is a Tenchi! Remember?
<Ryoko>Oh yeah! Kinky!

Washu said.
TRJ grabs a camera and walks, or runs,

<Kione>It's walks or runs. Not such a hard choice.
<Sasami>Hello? This is TRJamesGal14 we are talking about!
<Kione>Oh yeah.

I don't care, out of the lab.

*********************************
Two Hours Later
*********************************

"I haven't seen anything so dirty since I fell into a pool of dirt." TRJ
stumbles into the room.

<Ryoko&Sasami>AHHHH! TENCHI DID IT WITH HIMSELF!!!!
<Kione>And she didn't even detail the sex.
<Sasami>You'd wanna see Tenchi doing the female him?
<Kione>...well...

She inserts the 400 rolls of film into a drawer, locking it up, and then
ataching a battery to
the lack so to electrectute anyone that tries to get the film without a
key.

<Kione>Last time I checked, batteries didn't electrectute people. They
may electrocute people, but not electrectute.
<Ryoko>In the authors world, maybe.
<Sasami>That's a place I don't wanna go to. Ever.

The battery was charged with electercity from her Zapdos.

"Now who am I forgeting? YOSHO!!!!!!!!!"

<Sasami>::covers eyes:: Oh no....
<Kione>::rolls eyes:: They wont rape you again. This author couldn't
write a properly rated NC-17 if her life depended on it. (See previous MST,
Twisted
Tenchi and Girls -MSTed.)
<Sasami>::Shivers::

TRJ grabs her camera and runs out of the door, towards the shrine.

"What do we have here? Oh, Yosho watching Tenchi

<Ryoko>Rape Sasami!
<Sasami>Ahh! ::hits Ryoko:: I wouldn't be talking, James fucker!
<Kione>That wasn't cool.
<Ryoko>Hey! I was kidding!
<Kione>Let's go.

::They exit the theatre::
<Sasami>I'm sick of msting all these crappy fics. They're so annoying.
<Kione>I know, why don't we try writing our own fics?
<Tenchi>Ok, I guess. I'll start. One fine day, Tenchi moved far, far away
from all of you, to. . . to . . Tahiti, yes, that's far away. Then he-
<Ryoko>Met a beautiful, mysterious Tahitian girl named Ryoko who he fell in
love with.
<Tenchi>No he didn't!
<Ryoko>Yes he did! And they consumated their fiery love in a torrid fit of
heated passion.
<Tenchi>No that didn't happen!
<Ryoko>Yes it did! Many times!
<Kione>Then Tenchi got a job in a bar, and then a stunning and intelligent
Tahitian police officer named Kione walked in and ordered a club soda.
<Tenchi>No she didn't!
<Mihoshi>And then Kione's partner Mihoshi, another Tahitian police officer,
ordered a prune juice.
<Kione>No! No she didn't!
<Mihoshi>Of course she did, Kione! And then s-
<Sasami>But then an adorable little Tahitian girl named Sasami walked in and
Tenchi married her.
<Tenchi>What? That doesn't even make sense!
<Sasami>Yes it does!
<Tenchi>Wait, let's start over.
<Ayeka>I agree. Once there was the Jurai Power, and then that power, after
centuries of time, passing from royal hand to hand as the ultimate power of
the universe, came to rest with a young boy. And after some years, that boy
met his destiny.
<Tenchi>I. . . have a feeling I know where this is going.
<Ayeka>Shut up and listen! So then the centuries old fate came to pass but
the boy was unwilling, and had to be punished according to proper Jurai
standards. So-
<Ryoko>The freedom loving space pirate Ryoko showed up to save Tenchi from
Ayeka's evil clutches.
<Ayeka>No she didn't! What are you talking about Ryoko? You're the evil one!
<Ryoko>Yes she did! And you're the evil one for wanting Tenchi all to
yourself!
<Tenchi>Um. . . maybe we should try another anime. Let's try a Dragonball
fic.
<Ryoko>Oh, ok. Once there were some dragonballs, and then I got Tenchi!
<Ayeka>No, I did!
<Kione>No, I did!
<Mihoshi>And then I used the dragonballs to wish that Kione was a man!
<Kione>NO YOU DIDN'T!
<Mihoshi>Yes I did!
<Washu>No, no, no, you're all doing it wrong. One day the amazing scientific
genius was employing shielded end points based upon the abrupt change in pH
level that occurs in the vacinity of the equivalence point to neutralize a
titration, and was in the middle of measuring the level of hydronium and
hydroxyl ions in the dissociat-
<Ayeka>GET TO THE POINT!!!!!!
<Washu>Ok. So that's how I got Tenchi and discovered Washunium!!!
<Tenchi>No you didn't!
<Washu>Yes I did! And then I-
<Ryo-Ohki>Meow! Meow meow meow meow, meow meow, meow meow meow meow, meow
meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow!
<Tenchi>Oh no. . .
<Ryoko>Hm, interesting. Ryo-ohki says that one day, she gave Tenchi a
carrot.
<Tenchi>Hm, I guess that's not as bad.
<Ryo-Okhi>Meow meow, meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow
meow meow!
<Ryoko>Then while Tenchi was taking the carrot, Ryo-ohki jumped into his
pants.
<Tenchi>No she didn't!
<Ryo-Ohki>Meow!!!!!
<Ryoko>Ryo-Ohki says yes she did. And th-
<Tenchi>Forget about it! The MST fics are better than this! Go back to the
theatre and let us never do this again!
<Ryoko>Oh, ok.
::Kione, Ryoko, and Sasami return to the theatre::

's Dad's tapes. Great! Who is that? Well
it's a chick wearing nothing so that should be good! Oh, man she
isn't!?I got you
YOSHO!!!!!!!!!!!!"TRJ clicks furiously at her camera.

<Sasami>God. This slumber party sucks!
<Ryoko>Yeah, no body is "slumbering." They're just having sex and taking
blackmail pictures.
<Kione>But who are they going to blackmail them to? They're all
involved, and every one outside of their little party wouldn't care.
<Ryoko>Yeah, but then they should change the name to "Having sex and
taking blackmail photos that no one will care about" party.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two Hours from Now

<Kione>The readers were still reading this lousy fic.
<Sasami>Well, we are still here. Any other reader would have stopped by
now, I hope.

___________________________________________________

"Please give us back those pictures!!!!!" Tenchi is begging TRJ on his
hands and knees.

<Ryoko>(Tenchi) Me banging a female me is sooooooo hot!
<Kione>But if they got the photos, then it wouldn't matter if TRJ still
had the negatives.
<Sasami>I bet TRJ wouldn't understand one word of that.

"We'll do anything!!!!!!!!"George W. Bush is begging on his knees for
the pictures of him and hiS
rubber ducky during bathey time.
(AN: Rubber Ducky!!!HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!Bathy
Time!!!!HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAA!!!!!!!)"

<Ryoko>(To author) Yes. You are so clever. Lets laugh at you. Hahah.

Anything?" They all nod their heads. "Well..."

"So this is what it feels like to be the president of the United
States."

<Kione>Who would vote for TRJ?
<Ryoko>How could TRJ even be in the running?
<Kione>If George W. Bush can do it, anyone can. Well, maybe not TRJ.
<Sasami>Who would make TRJ president of anything?
<Kione>Make her president of button factory.
<Ryoko>Nah, that's a diss to the poor buttons.

TRJ is sitting at her desk with a navy blue suit on. Washu, Sasami,
Renne and Reo-Oki were sitting next to her. "You guys ever wonder want
to know what happend to Ayeka?

<Ryoko>No. The fic will get worse if you even mention her name.
<Sasami>Could this fic get worse?

I mean she was trying to kill Serena. Maybe she changed into Sailor Moon
and kicked her ass what do you think?"They all looked around the room
and got pieces of paper of paperr

<Ryoko>::Pulls out a piece of paper of papperr.:: What the hell is this?

and threw in them in a hat. "Dead, Dead, Dead, Dead, and Exploded into
four million carbohydreated protons by the effort of a nerotomic blast."

<Sasami>I bet TRJ knows nothing about what she is talking about.
Especially because those words don't exist.
<Ryoko>Really. Carbohydreated? Nerotomic? What the fuck is that?
<Kione>Some random crap that apparently makes no sense.

TRJ read the pieces of paper, when she was done she looked a Washu.

<Sasami>She looked a Washu?
<Ryoko>Never mind.

Everyone else was too.

<Kione>Everyone else was looking a Washu?

"Tell me how you did this?" Washu looked puzzled at TRJ's question. "How
did you fit all that
on a 1by1 inch piece of paper?"

<Ryoko>Of paperr.

Washu smiled. They were all converted
into a classroom

<Ryoko>So we turned into classrooms?

And Washu was wearing a Teaching Uniform.

<Sasami>A classroom in a teaching uniform? Something I'd like to see.

"Now, my students..." Washu began. "Here we go again..." TRJ mumbled
under her breath.

*******************************
Three Hours Later
****************************

"That's how I was able to fit that on such a little piece of paper."

<Kione>Of paperr.

Everyone in the room is
asleep, other then TRJ, who was the only one who understood anything
Washu said.

<Kione>So even Washu didn't understand what she was saying?
<Sasami>No, but I was right. A self insertion.
<Ryoko>Yeah! Even I can't understand Mom! This girl can?
<Kione>(TRJ) I'm so smart. Nobody understands science but me. However, I
decided to make up all the science words.

"Washu, I think you should learn how to shorten your speechs." TRJ
walked past Washu and
returned to her office back into an office.

<Ryoko>Is that where they keep the pieces of paper of paperr?

"Man do you suck!!!!!!!! TRJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Sasami was yelling

<Sasami>I agree with me.
<Kione>You read my mind.

for TRJ because Washu
insisted in making something that would turn them all into genuises.
Reo-Oki had just stood
there and hissed at Washu. TRJ entered the room. "Okay you guys can you
please sit down
and not fight?" TRJ whispered into Washu's ear something that made her
smile.

<Kione>Uh oh....
<Ryoko>NO MOM!!! NOT TRJ!!!! I don't want her to be my... mom?...

What happened to everyone else, well James was drunk when he kissed
Ryoko.

<Ryoko>Hah. The lousy ass.

So he was TRJ's husband now.

<Kione>What the hell? Lets say I'm drunk. I kiss some guy. But I was
drunk. So I am automatically married to someone else?
<Ryoko>You can keep him, bitch!
<Sasami>And if this is a self-insertion, it's sad that this person WANTS
to get married to James.

Everyone else was chilling out as the new pres's servants.

<Kione>Yes. Because in a democracy, the president still had servants.

George W. Bush has to was the dishes and the laundry...for the entire
Board. \

<Sasami>What the hell? Why was George W. Bush at the Masaki household,
or where ever the hell it was? And why did TRJ become president without
an inaugration? AHHHH! None of this makes any
sense of any kind.

Which is just Jessie and Meowth. Jessie has at least 900,000,000
diffrent outfits.

<Ryoko>900 million. Really.
<Sasami>Too bad they all have a giant red R on them.

Everyone other then that has to just be themselves and do whatever she
says TRJ other
then Ryoko

<Ryoko>Who soon blew TRJ to bits! HAHAHAH
<Kione>Yes, we all have impossible reveries...

who is the one and ONLY Vice-Pres. James is First Man.
