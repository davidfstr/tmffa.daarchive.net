        The scene opens in the middle of one off those peaceful breakfast
scenes
that Tenchi in
Tokyo was made famous by.
        Ayeka was yelling at Ryouko and Noboyuki.  Ryouko was yelling
at Ayeka and Noboyuki.  Kiyone was yelling at Mihoshi and Noboyuki.  Wasyuu
was yelling at Mihoshi and Noboyuki.
Mihoshi was crying and yelling at Noboyuki.
        Suddenly everthing freezes except for Noboyuki, as he stands up
and screams.

Noboyuki:       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Then starts singing.

Noboyuki:       My sons got a girlfriend, man I hate that bitch
        She tells me everyday,
        She says "man we really gotta loose your shit
        We need to redecorate".
        They sit on thier ass, I work my hands to the bone
        For a little money every payday
        But they want more dinero just to stay at home
        Ayeka, I'm 'bout to say

        I won't pay! I Won't Pay!  No Way!
        NA NA Why don't you get a Job?!?
        Say No Way! Say No Way!  No Way!
        NA NA Why don't you get a Job?!?

        I get all this money but it isn't enough
        To keep the bill collectors at bay.
        I get all this money but it isn't enough
        These girls are tryna burry me!

        I won't pay! I Won't Pay!  No Way!
        NA NA Why don't you get a Job?!?
        Say No Way! Say No Way!  No Way!
        NA NA Why don't you get a Job?!?

        Well I guess it ain't easy doin' nuthin' at aaaaallllllll

Ryouko(Unfreeze):       But hey man free rides just don't come alooooong

Noboyuki:       Let me tell you 'bout the other girl now!

        My son's other girlfriend thinks that I'm a dick
        She tells me everyday
        She wants more dinero just to stay at home
        Ryouko I'm 'bout to say

        <end song>

        As the song ends, the girls unfreeze only to get thier butts
kicked and tossed out in the yard.

Yugi:   Mr. Masaki, can Sasami come out and play?

^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^

Jake:   Well,  I guess I should appologise to the AFC, the RFFC, KOME,
the TTDG, and what
ever you Wasyuu fans call yourselves.  This was meant in good fun.  Except
the part where Noboyuki kicks the girls butts.  That shoud've
happen a long time ago.
        I'm a Big fan of Noboyuki.  Becuase he reminds me of MY dad.
Yeah he's a freak, But
He's a nice guy.  But no one seem sto give him (Noboyuki) credit for
his good points.  They only seem to notice his voyuerism (probably
mispelled).
        Well, that's it for now.  Visit my web site
www.geocities.com/jakethegoose2069/Wildeyak_Tenchi_Fanart.  I also
think Sakuya and Tenchi Were made for each other.  Until next time,
SLIDE!
