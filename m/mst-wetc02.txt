The dark chair slowly turns, revealing a surprisingly handsome and humble (heh) otaku.  “This isn’t my private hell anymore I’m sharing it with 3 other people.”  Some cackling occurs.  “Well let’s start, shall we?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vegita:Nooooo I though this was over.
M:Not by a long shot.
Ryoko:Your going to die.
M:You said that to Tenchi he’s still here.
Tenchi:For the record she was moody with me for a few days.
Vegita:So what’s our assignment
M:Washu’s Erotic Torture Chamber part 2.
All:NOOOOOOO
M:YES!  After that last one I felt I had to write the next one.
Vegita:Why

Tenchi:Into the theater?
Ryoko:Yep
M:Well I guess I’ll never mst with my idol weber-san
Ryoko:Why?
M:Can’t think of better characters to use that you two
Vegita:Excuse me for being a natural choice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

M:I hope he gets sued
Ryoko:Or killed
Tenchi:I like Ryoko’s idea better
Vegita:Me too                                       


Chapter2: THE EROTIC TORTURE CHAMBER

(Washu's lab)----- "There, it's complete," said Washu as she wiped a
bit of
sweat off her eye brow. "It's a masterpiece! Truely some of my best work
ever. "Yeah Washu, your the greatest!" said Washu #1 "Ra ra ra
Washu!" said
Washu #2.  "The erotic torture chamber is finally complete!"

M:K the puppets never said that before
Ryoko:MY MOM IS NOT LIKE THAT
Vegita:I’m staying silent for once
Tenchi:I wish it wasn’t complete
(LIVING ROOM)

"Ayeka, will you go to Washu's lab and tell her that dinner is ready
please?" said Sasami. "Oh, sure Sasami" said Ayeka.

Tenchi:No one wants to go to Washu’s lab.
Ryoko:No one

As Ayeka walked towards Washu's lab, she couldn't help but feel slightly
scared, because Washu's been acting very stange the past couple of months.

M:Just noticed?
Ryoko:Wait why am I bad mouthing my mom?
Vegita:You secretly hate her and wish for her death?

<knock, knock> "Um, Washu, um, are you in there?" <knock, knock, knock>
3
minutes went by and Ayeka was feeling quite scared......she finally came up
with enough courage to open Washu's door about 4 inches and peeked inside.
She couldn't see much besides darkness and a few lights in the
distance......

M:She walked into the light and somehow destroyed the earth, ending this fic
Ryoko:Yeah
Tenchi:Later

she proceeded to open the door and slowly walked in....she
walked down a narrow staircase lite by torches untill she came to a hallway
with several doors on each side, at the end of the hallway was a massive
door with some demonic symbol on it. 

Vegita:Wait nevermind that’s just the room the fish is stored in
Ryoko:You wanna think about that sentence, fish...lemon...
Vegita:Don’t get it
M:What smells like fish
Tenchi:It smells like fish?!?
Ryoko:I can show you Tenchi!!!

Ayeka was now trembeling with fear.She saw a giant keyhole and thought to herself how dungeons and dragons like this place appeared to be. 

M:Then realized her, or any one else in that universe ever heard of that game
Tenchi:Dungeon’s and Dragon’s?
Vegita:Game, kinda fun, too much work though.

Then she heard a faint screeming voice... "no! please don't!  stop it please! 

M:Get me out of this fic, please stop writing me in
I have a wife...and kids...and....and...." Ayeka then heard
Washu saying something but couldn't make out the words. Out of her natural
female nosieness, she peeked through the keyhole."gasp!!!" 

M:cough!!!
Vegita:yawn!!!
Tenchi:ummm...umm!!!?
Ryoko:It works my love

Ayeka covered her
mouth with her hands in complete shock at the sight of what Washu was doing
to a middle aged man. 

Tenchi:Dental surgery!
Vegita:I know bout that brother.  Goku hits pretty hard

"okay Ayeka , your just seeing things, there's no way
what you just saw is what it appeared to be." Ayeka tried to tell herself.

M(Ayeka):Washu can’t perform a triple baypass, a double maybe...

She then braced herself to look into the hole again.....she almost fainted
at what she saw....Washu was circumcising the man with her teeth! 

Tenchi, M, and Vegita:OOOWWWWWWW
Ryoko:That painful?
The Men:YES!

Washu looked like a demon, her teeth were pointed and sharp like a sharks, her
eyes were completely red as she continued to tear at the poor mans dick. blood
was everywhere. 

Tenchi:Now she’s never getting that sample
M:Like she ever was
Ryoko:My mom isn’t coming near you

With the press of a couple of buttons, the machine that the man
was strapped to, formed his body into a "T" shape. Washu sat in what
appeared to be a thrown with a giant control panal in front of it. Washu
smirked as she put on a giant platnium crown with diamonds all over it on
her head. 
Vegita:That must be a heavy piece of metal
M:Is platnium that heavy?
Vegita:Not really sure

She pressed a few more buttons and the machine shot out a fat leather
wip and began wipping the man.....

Tenchi:Wippin with a wip eh, that like a new way to make cool whip?
M:Think about what you just said
Ryoko:TENCHI I love you but... I can’t be responsible for my actions

Ayeka, still frozen with shock, decided she'd seen enough and slowly took a few steps back...she tripped and fell over one of the cracks in Washu's stone floor and fell. <crash!> Ayeka fell down on the hard floor with a loud bang. The noise made a loud echo throughout Washu's giant Medevil looking dungeon. "Did you here
somethimg?"

M:I didn’t here anythimg
Vegita:Heh

said Washu with a satasfied smile on her face. But the only answer she could
get out of the man was a low groan of pain because he was wipped so many
times.

Tenchi:Wipped eh so....
M:I’d shut up Tenchi, while you still have a head

"I'm, gonna go check on that noise and leave you there to bleed to death k?

Vegita(as man):Okay well ba bye now, ba bye

Don't go anywhere now." said Washu silently laughing to herself.
Ayeka was so scared that she couldn't move. Washu opened the evil looking
door only to see pathetic little Ayeka frozen stiff.

M:Thus she died and Washu had a heart attack ending our pain.
Ryoko:And allowing Ryoko to win Tenchi
Vegita:Always on the bright side
"What the fuck are you doing here?!" Exclaimed Washu. "Oh um...um...i
was just......um...oh yeah! I was just gonna tell you that dinner was ready!"

M(as Ayeka):We have some meat you can rip up, nothing in the right shape though
All:EWWWWWW

Ayeka said very happy that she remembered what to say. "Well just how long
have you been standing there?! How much did you see?!" "oh, I just got
here"said Ayeka looking guiltier than ever. "Well, what are we waiting for, let's go get some grub!"
Ayeka was very relieved that she got off so easily.

All:Kill her, and end the fic

"So whats Sasami making for dinner?" Asked Washu, trying to break the
silence. " oh um..uh....salmon!" said Ayeka glad that she remembered
what to say for the 2nd time.

M:Another fish joke Tenchi?
Tenchi:No
Ryoko:Really Tenchi, just come here and I’ll enlighten you
Vegita:I’d go for it

"Well thats just great.  Um..that sounds pretty good." said Washu
struggling to engage in conversation. "Yeah...uhh...it sure does" Ayeka replied
more akwardly than ever.

M:Tenchi Muyo, No Need for Starting a New Paragraph When Someone Else Speaks
Ryoko:Long title
Vegita:Damn straight

After what seemed like hours, but was only 5 minutes went by, everyone was
sitting at the table and eating.  Things were very akward at the table
between Ayeka, Sasami, and Washu.

"Mmmmmm, this is very tasty Sasami." Said Mihoshi. "Oh yeah, it's
great!" said the rest of the gang. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah
whatever...moving on to more important matters, like WHAT WASHU HAS BEEN
DOING IN THAT DARK LAB OF HERS ALL ALONE THESE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS!"

Vegita:Torturing
M:Biting to be frank

said Ryouko 

Ryoko:Who is Ryouko?
M:A genetically engineered typo

in a badgering tone of voice. "Yeah Washu what have you been
working on all of this time?" Asked Kiyone. "Probably another disaster of hers!"

Ryoko:Your partner who creates the disasaters
M:Good point
said Ryouko. "I just know that I don't wanna be around when what ever
she's making makes it's way into this house." 

M:No one will, just take my word
Vegita:Run, run faster than we would if the doors weren’t locked from the outside

"Nonsense, i'm sure that whatever Washu is making will be as delightful as she is." said Yosho.

M:Wow first he shows emotion then he makes no sense
Vegita:He never makes sense
Tenchi:No he does, just not much

 "giggle giggle....you old people must have some sort of bond with each other."
said Ryouko, stuffing her face with fried rice. "Thats it! you have insulted me
and this family enough Ryouko! I am getting sick and tired of your arragent
attitude and if you don't pull together your act, i will have to ask you to
leave!"exclaimed Yosho.

M:Hah your typo of a sis just pissed of Yosho
Tenchi:Again he would never do that
Vegita:He does kinda hate Ryoko
Ryoko:Yeah but this is Ryouko

 "Grandfather, don't talk to Ryouko that way!"
"It's okay Tenchi, I was just Leaving!" shouted Ryouko.

Ryouko stormed out the door and was about to fly away when------

M:She got some common sense and killed everyone thus saving us
Ryoko:Let it be true

"Ryouko wait!" shouted Tenchi. "Come back!" "huh?" said Ryouko.

Ryouko was amazed at how Tenchi actually wanted her to come back.

Tenchi:I always do that
Ryoko:And I’m not often amazed

"Ryouko, I have to talk to you." said Tenchi. "what about Tenchi?" Said a
very curious Ryouko. "it's been really driving me crazy lately but ever
since i saw you....well, well i've alway's loved you.

Vegita:When did he grow a pair
Tenchi:Hello I’m sitting right here
Vegita:Point being?

This was too much for Ryouko, she could hardely stand on her own two feet!

M:I thought she was flying
Vegita:That’s why she wasn’t on her own two feet.

"Are you serious?"asked Ryouko. "Yes my darling." said a very nervous
Tenchi. "Here why don't we go somewhere where we can talk." suggested
Tenchi.

M:Darling
Tenchi:What am I a southern gentleman?

Tenchi and Ryouko walked to a nearby bar where Tenchi and Ryouko
coincedentally both go when they want to drain their problems. They both
engage in deep conversation about how Washu is alway's in her lab and how
they love each other so much.

M:Then Tenchi got thrown out because he was 17 and Ryoko got pissed and killed everyone
Vegita:Not that easy
Tenchi and Ryoko:Stop talking about us like we’re not here

"So my grandfather wants me to marry Ayeka so I can become successor to
the thrown of Jurai." said Tenchi. "Big woop! my mother wants me to marry
Satan so I can overpower him and become successor to hell! said Ryouko as she
downed a small cup of saki.

M:Hey little Mickey!
Tenchi:Ryoko wouldn’t overpower satan. No offense
Vegita(as Ryoko as Adam Sandler):Never doubt my skills
Ryoko between malleting Vegita says:None taken
Another two hours pass and.......

"Well i'm bored, let's go home and have sex okay Tenchi?"

Ryoko:K now that’s me
Vegita:Go for it Tenchi
M:I gotta agree, there’s a room in the back

"Um...okay
Ryouko...but I must warn you, I don't have a very big........."

M(as Tenchi):Well you know having never seen a girl till I was 17 i’m no moose
Vegita:Hung like a mouse
Tenchi:I’M SITTING RIGHT HERE, AND I’M WELL ENDOWED
Ryoko:He is
Ryoko mallets MChan and Vegita

"Dick? oh thats okay i'll take care of that" said a very nonchalant
Ryouko.

All of the sudden, Tenchi felt his dick grow about an extra 6 inches and he
was quite amazed.

M:You can do that Ryoko?
Ryoko:Guess so
M and Vegita:You owe us one for something...

"uuuuhhh, Ryouko?" "Yes Tenchi?" "Is this permanet?" asked
Tenchi "Let's just put it this way, you've got 4 hours to show me a good time, and if
your as good as Ayeka dreams of you being...than you'll be almost good enough
for me!"said Ryouko

Tenchi:Almost, I’m hurt
Vegita:Suck it up, you got a four o clock boner
Tenchi:Huh
M:Five o clock shadow, dumb joke

Tenchi and Ryouko both burst out laughing.....

M:For reference that was in the fic not us
Ryoko:No laughing here

(BACK AT THE MASAKI RESIDENCE...)

"Sasami, you know what time it is?!" said Ayeka with a very evil smile.

M(as sasami):Well it’s 8 o clock time for you to smile evilly

Sasami almost burst into tears.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stop the fic!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tenchi:Woot are we free?
M:No, I just realized that the Ryoko/Vegita thing is overplayed so, later Prince
Vegita disappears.
M:K now to get another mst... ahh this will even things out
Noin suddenly appears
Noin:What the hell, damnit first Weber-san takes Zechs and ruins his mood now you.
M:Well the sooner you shut up the sooner we will be done, besides you should be honered.
"Oh please Ayeka! not tonight...please! i beg of you!...my pussy is still
soooooo sore from the other night! please no!!!

Ryoko:Urrp I suddenly remembered the last fic
Tenchi:Please noo
Noin:What a line to walk in on
M:Save the vomit bags, nothing has happened... yet

Ayeka grabbed Sasami by the hair and pulled her all the way down the hall to
where her room was.

"Shuddup you little bitch!" exclaimed Ayeka. " I'm really pissed off
about Lord Tenchi taking the side of that pirate tramp! and i'm gonna take it
all out on you!" 

M:Don’t do that
Noin:Yeah, I hardly know the kid, but don’t hurt her
Ryoko:One more reason to kill her
Tenchi:Come on Ayeka would never do this
Ryoko:Even I agree with that

"Oh Ayeka, i'm really sorry about what happened with Tenchi but
please don't do it to me tonight! PLEASE!"

M:Then Ayeka came to her senses and blew her brains out for raping her little sister
Noin:Cool maybe Zech’s wasn’t on call tonight... well later
Ryoko:Sit down, we’re never that lucky...
Tenchi:NEVER
Tenchi burst into tears

Sasami tried all the reasoning she could to get out of her nightly chor, but
she would have to be a little more realistic, Ayeka has had an exceptionally
hard day today, and the better the day, the nicer Ayeka would take it out on
Sasami. 

M:Raise your hands if that last sentence didn’t make any sense
All raise hands
Tenchi:Now raise your hand if this lemon doesn’t make any sense
All raise hands

Ayeka ripped off Sasami's clothes. That was the fifth pair she's
ripped in a week thought Sasami. 

M:Yeah but since she always wears the same thing she either stinks or has a lot of the same Kimono
Ryoko:It’s the latter, believe me we all have closets full of the same clothes
Tenchi:It’s true

But Sasami knew she had bigger things to worry about.  

M:No F*(&ing kidding

Ayeka took off her own clothes and revealed the black leather sex mistress outfit she would wear every time she tortured her sister.

M:Damn you Happosai for writing that in

Ayeka looked VERY sexy in it...her top sufficated her double D chest and her black
leather thong fit tightly around her clean shaven cunt. 

M:Out of curiousity, that’s gotta hurt when ya cut that thing right, cause I mean...
Ryoko:Wouldn’t know
Noin:Don’t look at me

She also wore knee high leather boots with red laces. Ayeka tied Sasami down to her 4 post bed in the shape of an "X", so that Sasami's legs were wide open.

All:EWWWWWWW

" okay Sasami, instead of the usual ducktape I have to use to shut your
little mouth, i'm gonna use the traditional ball gag."

M(as Ayeka):Because traditional is good, like the tradition of older sisters raping their younger sisters on our home planet
Ryoko:Don’t joke, that’s true in some places of Jurai
Tenchi:Really!?!
Ryoko:Ayeka did want to marry her half brother

Ayeka strapped the ball gag around Sasami's haed, wich completely muted
Sasami from trying to screem out in agonizing pain. 

Noin:Or even scream

Ayeka pulled out a wip from her catwoman halloween costume she wore last year and began to snap it just to intimidate Sasami. 

M:Hmm damn can’t blame Happosai for that.

Ayeka then cocked her hand back, and lunged the wip at sasamis bare pussy and slashed it.

Noin and Ryoko:OOWWWWWWW
M:I’ll take your word for it that it hurts
Tenchi:Same here

"MMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNHHHHHMMMMMMOOOOOONNNNNNNN!!!!!!!"Were the only words that could be heard coming from Sasami's mouth. " I knew it was a good idea to use a ball gag this time. Sasami....you better get used to the taste of
that ball gag because your gonna be wearing it for a long time."

Noin:That better not be prophetic
M:I doubt the writer of this knows what prophetic means
Ryoko:Yeah so do I

Ayeka did one of her loud evil annoying laughs and cracked the wip at
Sasami's pussy another 23 times.Sasami's pussy was very swollen when
Ayeka decided to do something differen't.

M:Because something different won’t do, try all new differen’t!

"I'm not getting enough pleasure out of this!" yelled Ayeka.

Noin:Yeah but she’s getting enough pain you damn pedo

At that moment, Ayeka slide off her leather panties and massaged her pussy..

"oooooooo yes! mmmmmmm yes! oooooooo baby!"

M:Now go masturbate and leave your little sister alone

Ayeka knew she was going to cum so she stood on top of her bed hoovering
over sasami's body and just let it all flow out on Sasami. 

Tenchi:ewwwwww
Ryoko:You know Tenchi, I could do something like that to you
M:Once again, grow a pair and go for it.

Sasami's body was completely drenched with liquid. Ayeka then got on top of Sasami and slithered up and down her body so that her fluids were evenly smeard
everywhere.Blood mixed with the fluids giving Sasami a pleasent shade of
pink.

Noin:Better the hell be blood from the gaping gunshot wound in Ayeka’s head
Ryoko:I am going to kill her
M:I got the author
Tenchi:I’ll help

"Okay Sasami, thats enough for tonight."

All:Yeah
(TENCHI'S ROOM)

"Alright Ryouko, make yourself comfortable on my bed and i'm gonna go
take a shower." Said Tenchi. "Okay my Tenchi" Said Ryouko in a soft sexy
voice that she knew drove Tenchi wild.

Ryoko:How come Ryouko gets to sleep with him and not me
M(Whispering to Tenchi):Damnit man just go for it, there’s a room you can use in the back

(IN THE SHOWER)

Tenchi was looking down admiring his new cock with the biggest smile he had
ever had on his face before. He begain to jack off when he remembered that
he'd better save it for Ryouko. At the end of his shower Tenchi dried off
and put on a pair of silk boxers.

Tenchi:I don’t jack off
Noin:And Ayeka doesn’t rape Sasami, but in this fic you guys do
M:Besides your not that big, take off the six inches and your still hung like a mouse

(TENCHI'S ROOM)

Ryouko stood on all fours looking hotter than ever...her huge chest smiling
right at Tenchi. Her nipples were the color of her hair.

Ryoko:K Ryouko might, but I don’t have cyan nipples
M:How exactly does a chest smile at someone?
Noin:Not really sure, I think it’s a figure of speach

"Well Tenchi what are you waiting for?"said Ryouko in the same voice
tone. "
I....i...i...you are so fucking hot!" said Tenchi, with a very big bulge
in
his boxers.  "Fuck ME!!!!" demanded Ryouko. "Yes master."said
Tenchi.

M:Ack cheap dime store porno
Tenchi:And how would you know about that
M:Reputation only I assure you
Ryoko:But yeah he’s right
Tenchi:@_@

Tenchi pulled down his boxers reveling his incredible cock. Ryouko layed
back waiting for Tenchi to make his move. Tenchi put his face between Ryouko's
legs and began to insert his toung in and out of Ryouko's pussy.

"OOOOOO GOD TENCHI OOOOO!!!!!!"screemed Ryouko.

Ryoko brandishes her sword:Only I got to make love to Tenchi
Noin:This new chick beat you too him
M:Pretty slick for a typo
All:-_-
M:No pun intended

Ryouko arched her back in pleasure.she wrapped her legs around Tenchi's
head so that he had no chance of escaping her deathgrip, 

M:Hey Tenchi she’s going to kill you, cool
Ryoko:Even though I love you, I’m kinda happy, seing how you betrayed me and all

but Tenchi didn't care he kept sucking and slurping on her hot wet sex. Ryouko began to act violent.

All:BEGAN?!?

She threw Tenchi down on the bed and sat on his face, practically
sufficating him with her ass and clit. She began humping Tenchi's face, grinding her
pussy violently on Tenchi's mouth.

M:That can’t be good for Tenchi
Tenchi(as Tenchi as Shatner):Can’t.... breathe..... ass and.... pussy.... blocking air

"OOO TENCHI! OOOOHHH TENCHI!!!!!!!!OOOOOHHHHHHH TENCHI!!!!!!!!!!

Ryouko furiously continued to hump Tenchi's  face. She climaxed about 3
times already and gooo was running down the sides of Tenchi's face. 

Ryoko:Tenchi do that to me please...!!!!
M:Go for it
Noin:Gotta agree be a man

Tenchi was choking and gagging on Ryouko's cum and slapped Ryouko's left cheek to
signal her to get off of him but Ryouko kept humping hisd face and suddenly realized that humans can't live without air.

M:In one universe either can Ryokos
Ryoko:This one can

"oh my dear lord Tenchi are you okay?"said Ryouko sorrier than she's
ever been. "It's okay Ryouko." Said Tenchi, still gasping for air. "But
it's my turn!"

M(as Tenchi):Since I don’t have a pair I’ll run really really fast
Tenchi:For the third or fourth time, I’m sitting right her!

Right before Ryouko could reply, Tenchi grabbed her head, and shoved his
dick down her throat. 

Noin:Which burst through her head and she died
Ryoko:There was much rejoicing

Ryouko was overwhelmed with dick. 

M:As was she with Tom and Harry

So Ryouko began to suck....she sucked it so hard that Tenchi's dick was turning purple. 

M:Oww, some chick tried that once, damn bitch hurt me
Ryoko:You probably deserved it
M:That hurts

Vains began to bulge through Tenchi's dick as Ryouko continued to suck. 35
minutes went by and Ryouko kept sucking and swallowing Tenchi's cum. Ryouko was
getting tired of the same salty semen taste so she bit down on Tenchi's
dick with her sharp teeth and drew some blood from Tenchi's cock. 

Tenchi and M:Owwwwwwwww!!!!!!
Noin:Be men
M:How about I bite off your clit, then you say that
Noin:I respectfully retract my last words

It didn't hurt Tenchi that much so he continued to let her suck and swallow.

M:*coughBullshitcough*

"Thats enough Ryouko, I want to be inside of you"

Ryouko, now more excited than she's ever been removes her lips from Tenchi
and gets on top of him. Tenchi's giant cock penetrats her pussy and give's
Ryouko the chills.

M(as Ryouko):Buurrrrrrr
Ryoko:I never get cold
Noin:Me either
M:Not a guy thing either
Tenchi:Well I feel left out
Ryoko:You don’t have to be you know...

Tenchi bounces Ryouko up and down, up and down, up and
down. Ryouko's eyes roll backwards as Tenchi fucks her all night.

M:Him this is going to different tenses
Noin:You just notice
M:No

"Get on alll fours Ryouko!" Demanded Tenchi.

Without a word Ryouko got on all fours with her big firm (every black
man's
dream) ass and arched her back so that her ass was sticking straight up ,

M:BIGOT, DIE!
Ryoko:That wasn’t really racist you know, not too much
M:Yeah but I hate people catagorizing, and stereotyping anyone

in the air. Tenchi grabbed his dick, and shoved the whole thing in to
Ryouko's ass hole at once. 

Ryoko:Owwww
Noin:I bet that hurts
Ryoko:It does
M scribbles something down on a note pad
Tenchi:You know your just giving sick writers more ideas...

The threads of her ass ripped and Tenchi held it in
there...not humping or anything and wondering why Ryouko hasn't screemed
yet.

M:Because she never learned to screem, scream maybe, but not screem

"Ryouko.....are you okay?"said Tenchi in a very worried voice. <no
answer>
"RYOUKO! ARE YOU OKAY!"

Tenchi was so scared that he killed her or something.

M:We wouldn’t be so lucky
Noin:With our luck he’d be a necrophiliac
All but Tenchi:Ewwwww
Tenchi:I’M NOT LIKE THIS!!!

"I...I...I am a...a...alright tenchi" said Ryouko.

All:Damn

Tears were running down her precious cheeks. Tenchi had fucked her in the
ass soo hard, that she wouldn't be able to express the pain by screeming...

M:Screamin..
Ryoko:Shut up, that joke is old now

so she remained quiet, with tears pouring down her face, and blood gushing from her
ass. They both said good night and held eachother in their arms and went to bed.

The End

All:Yes!!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With that the three anime characters disapper, and MChan goes back to grab his Katana, someone’s gonna bleed because of this fic, and it ain’t gonna be Sasami, poor Sasami.
