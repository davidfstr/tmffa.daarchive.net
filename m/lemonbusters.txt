If all the girls in your home are acting kind of strange
Who you gonna call?
Lemonbusters!
If Ayeka and Ryoko are getting a little too friendly and it don't look good
Who you gonna call?
Lemonbusters!

I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic
I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic

If you catch Washu naked and has a dildo in her hand
Who can you call?
Lemonbusters!
If you see the first princess of Juria getting it on with her little sister

Oh, who you gonna call?
Lemonbusters!

I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic
I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic

Who you gonna call?
Lemonbusters!
If you're all alone with Sasami and she wants to do the nasty with you,
pick up the phone and call
Lemonbusters!

I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic
I hear it likes the girls
I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Who you gonna call?
Lemonbusters!
When your two favorite GP officers are about to have a dose of hot freaky
lesbian sex
You'd better call
Lemonbusters!

Let me tell you something
Lemon Bustin' makes the world a little better place to live

I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic
I ain't afraid of no Lemon Fic

Don't get caught alone in a Lemon Fic, oh no
Lemonbusters!
When Ryoko says she wants you to screw her in her eye socket because she
doesn't have a cunt or an asshole.
Unless you're into that sort of thing
I think you better call
Lemonbusters!
Ow!

Who you gonna call
Lemonbusters!

How did you like my little parody? I came up with this song when I was
listening to one of "Weird Al" Yankovic parodies.

Nothing much more to say but thank for reading it.

See Ya.
