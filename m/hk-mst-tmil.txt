(Inside Starship-Ryo-Oki)

::Ayeka is sitting in hull of the ship, when a loud noise comes from Washu's
lab::
<Ayeka>What was that?
::Ryoko phases through the wall::
<Ryoko>Now, isn't that obvious?
<Ayeka>Well, honestly Ryoko, I don't find it that obvious
<Ryoko>OF COURSE! WASHU'S MAKING A NEW INVENTION!
<Ayeka>Why didn't I think of that?
::Tenchi walks in::
<Tenchi>Do you all know that Washu is making a new invention?
<Ryoko&Ayeka>Yeah.
::Washu walks in::
<Washu>We are being called by Clay.
::A screen appears with Clay on it::
<Dr. Clay>As I said,I stopped reading your fics before sending them, but
this should be pretty bad. Enjoy. Mwahahahaha.
::Screen dissapears::
<Ryoko>I hate that man.
<Washu>I'm not sure he's a man.
<Ayeka>Washu,what's your newest invention
<Washu>Well,it's-
::Lots of lights go off::
<Washu>WE GOT FANFICTION SIGN. I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
::Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi run into the theater::

TENCHI MUYO IN LUST
------------------------------------

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko sat watching one of Tenchi's father's films. Sasami
and
Ryo-Ohki were off visitting Tenchi's baby cousin Taro for a few days so they
pretty much
had the house to themselves.

On the screen, a beautiful Japanese girl was enjoying a thorough and loving
tongue-bath
from a handsome young Japanese man.

<Ayeka>I prefer a towel or sponge, myself.

They were both in their late teens and both seemed to
be enjoying themselves. It was clear from their smiles and relaxed attitude
that they were
both in love and the movie had more of a romantic aspect to it than a sexual
one.

<Ryoko>Watching Noboyuki porn isn't exactly how I'd spend a free afternoon.
<Ayeka>Well, it has been kind of quiet around here lately though.
<Ryoko>Hm, yeah, maybe then . . .

"Your father filmed this?"
"Yeah." Tenchi said, feeling a bit aroused by the movie. "Dad always was a
bit hentai.
Still you have to admit, it was pretty sneaky of him to film himself with
mom like this."

<Tenchi>Smile, you're on totally perverted video.

"You mean that girl is your mom?"
"Yeah." Tenchi admitted.

<Tenchi>And it's perfectly normal for me to be watching this video. And be
aroused by it.
<Ryoko>Well, look at the rest of your family (turns to Ayeka).
<Ayeka>Wha? (turns red)

"She looked so young and slim."
"Of course she did." Tenchi shouted at Ryoko. "She hadn't been pregnant
yet."
"Oh. Well excuse me." Ryoko huffed.

On the screen, Achika was about to mount the youthful Nobuyuki when she
suddenly
vanished from sight.

"Oh man! That had to be frustrating!" Ryoko sympathized.
"What the...?" Tenchi protested as his body started to flicker. Suddenly, he
was swept up
across the room and into the wall.

"I'm not too late for the orgy am I?" A manic voice asked from behind the
sofa.

<Ryoko>Someone really needs to explain to her what an orgy is. I think she
believed me when
I said it meant hanging out.

They turned to see Washu step out from behind the sofa.
"The problem is back in the past." Washu told them. "And here is the proof."
Washu showed them the part of the film where Achika had vanished.
"She's gone!" Ayeka exclaimed in alarm. "Achika's vanished."
"Many years ago something terrible happened." Washu explained. "Tenchi's
conception
was interrupted. As a result, the Masaki family died out."

<Ryoko>Well, that's not really so bad, aside from the Tenchi part I guess.

"Isn't there something we can do?" Ryoko asked.
"There is one thing. We have to go back and make sure that Nobuyuki and
Achika mate."
Washu surmised. "If they don't mate, Tenchi will never be born."

****

Kiyone let out a yelp of pain as the vibrator went in too deeply.
"MIHOSHI!!" She wailed.
"Oops. Sorry." Mihoshi whimpered. "I guess you'll have to punish me?" She
asked,
hopefully.
Kiyone grinned. "It's beginning to look that way." Kiyone said as she bent
down to
retrieve the whip from her toy chest. As she was bending over, she felt a
stiff plastic
cock thrust up into her. Looking around, she saw Ryoko standing there
wearing a strap on
dildo.
"Ryoko!" She gasped.
"Time for you to cum." Ryoko declared, triumphantly.

<Ayeka>Oh. My. God.
<Ryoko>Er. . . . . WITH KIONE?!?

Kiyone cried out in orgasm as Ryoko pounded her with the plastic penis.

<Tenchi>Because nothing's more fun than homosexual rape.
<Ayeka>We should merchandise this. A little clock with ryoko on it that says
"Time for you to cum"
<Ryoko>Maybe we should put you on it and have it say "Time for you not to
cum"
<Ayeka>Hey!

****

A short while later, when all the girls were satisfied for the moment, they
all found
themselves strapped into what looked like a carnival ride.

<Tenchi>Huh? I'm having trouble visualizing this. . .
<Ryoko>Relax, if we can make it through the last scene, we can make it
through anything.
<Ayeka>Heehee, 'Time for you to cum,' oh man. . .

"Now that you've got that out of your systems, I'm going to send you back in
time
to make sure Tenchi's father mates with Tenchi's mother." Washu explained.

<Ayeka>How are we supposed to do that exactly?
<Ryoko>Through the magic of ripping off Back To the Future and having lots
of sex between random characters from the show.
<Ayeka>Oh.

"Couldn't you think of a more romantic term?" Tenchi protested. "They're not
Pandas,
they're my parents."

<Ryoko>(As Washu)Ok. We gotta get your parents to fuck.
<Tenchi>Much better.

"Okay, okay." Washu sighed. "Well, time to accellarate"
"You can't be serious!" Tenchi protested. "This is already crushing my dick
as it is!"

<Tenchi>Wha?!? Where did that come from?
<Ayeka>The writer probably just forgot to explain it.

Washu made the machine go faster.

<Tenchi>What does crushing my dick have to do with time travel anyway?
<Ryoko>Nothing, the author's just into pain, apparantly.
<Ayeka>News Flash: Nothing In This Fic Makes Any Sense.

****

Ryoko didn't like dressing up as a waitress, but she found she had no
choice. The
first place Achika and Nobuyuki would go was bound to be a romantic
restaurant.
Achika and Nobuyuki walked into the restaurant, just as Washu predicted.
Ryoko
made her way toward them when the manager stopped her. "See to that young
man
over there."
he said, pointing to an attractive chestnut-haired young man sitting at a
booth in the
corner reading a menu.
Ryoko sighed and went over to the boy. "May I take your order?" She asked,
keeping
her eyes on Achika and Nobuyuki.
"What's the special?" He asked, eyeing the pretty pirate's cleavage.
"It's not me." Ryoko informed him, feeling a bit miffed at his forwardness..

<Ryoko>How did I get a job as a waitress so fast anyway? I m-
<Ayeka>*ahem*. . . what I just said.
<Ryoko>Oh, yeah.

"Pity." He smiled seductively at her. "I guess I'll have the katsudon then."
Ryoko rolled her eyes and stomped into the kitchen. "Just who does he think
he is?"
She grumbled as she prepared the meal the stranger had requested.

<Ryoko>Woah, this must be the worst staffed restaurant in the galaxy.

Although her mind
didn't think much of him, her body had another opinion. He certainly had a
great body,
that much was certain.

<Ayeka>Gee, will this end up in sex? Duh. . . maybe.
<Ryoko>Sex, leading up to sex, watching a video of your parents have sex,
this fic is certainly a
rich palette of literary color.

"Problem, Miss Ryoko?" Washu asked.
"No." Ryoko sighed, not wanting to let on that her body was attracted to
someone who
wasn't Tenchi.She was going to be Tenchi's wife someday, and she had no
intention of
being sidetracked by some opinionated, self-centered, devastatingly handsome
(where'd
*that* come from?!) young man. She brought the meal out to the young man and
made it
very clear that she had no interest in him by dumping it onto his head.

<Tenchi>Um. . . actually, that's probably IC.
<Ryoko>Hey!

The young man simply got up, and walked out with perfect and unflagging
dignity.
Ryoko followed him in a much less dignified manner, having been tossed out
bodily
by the restaurant owner. She sat on the curb, rubbing her bruised ass, and
swearing at
the departing figure. She gasped in pleasure and then noticed that her hand
had moved,
absently to her cunt. In disgust, she stopped fingering herself and cried
stomped off,
firmly ignoring all the leering young men who'd been watching her touch
herself.

<Ryoko>I'm masturbating in public now. Great.
<Ayeka>Hey, you were raping Kione a few scenes ago. . . .
<Ryoko>This is true.
<Tenchi>Cried stomped off? Someone's been typing with one hand again. . .
<Ayeka>(fic author)Golly, Ryoko masturbating! I am a genius!

::They leave the theater::

<Ryoko>So Washu, what is your invention?
<Ayeka>Yeah, what is it?
<Washu>Well, it's a wireless device that can play cd-quality sound,
anywhere, and I mean ANYWHERE!!!!!
<Tenchi>Um, Washu?
<Washu>Yes, Tenchi?
<Tenchi>That's a radio.
<Washu>Did I mention it can make fudge brownies?
<Ryoko>Washu, that's an easy bake oven, and a radio stuck together.
::Washu runs to her lab, crying::
<Tenchi>Good work, Ryoko, You pissed off Washu.
<Ayeka>Yeah, what did she ever do to you?
<Ryoko>Um...Created me???
<Tenchi>Whatever, let's go back in the theater.
::Ryoko,Tenchi, and Ayeka go back in the theater::

****

In the meanwhile, Ayeka was having a go at getting Achika and Nobuyuki
'together'.
She got herself positioned in a clothing store specializing in lingerie and
waited. Sure
enough, Achika walked in.
"May I help you?" Ayeka asked.
"I'm looking for something to catch my husband's interest." Achika
explained, blushing.

<Tenchi>They're already married? Huh?
<Ayeka>It isn't clear.
<Ryoko>Who cares?

"Hmmm..." Ayeka looked around, then spotted a very sexy teddie.

<Tenchi>Ruxpin.

"This looks pretty." She
told Achika. "Or maybe I could find you something in leather? Perhaps with a
whip?" That
always turned Juraian men on, surely the men here on Earth...

<Ayeka>What the?
<Ryoko>Just a vague reference to S&M in a desperate attempt to obscess about
a slightly different variety of sex.
<Tenchi>I don't know about you, but if someone came up to me and said they
were going to whip me for kicks, I'd
just be like, "You're kidding, right?"

"Huh? Where'd she go?" Ayeka
looked around, but Achika was already hurrying off."
"Oh, that went well." Ryoko laughed at her nemesis.

<Ryoko>How did I get there? I was outside masturb-
<Ayeka>*ahem*
<Ryoko>Oh, yeah.

"Well, at least I didn't get distracted by some guy." Ayeka pointed out.
"At least he was...." Ryoko let the rest of the sentence die in her throat.
"He was what?" Ayeka demanded. "Huh? What was he, Miss Ryoko? Tell me... Did
you think he was CUTE!"
"Don't be ridiculous. Besides he seemed more like your type then mine. "
"Just what is that supposed to mean?"
"Well, you're both a couple of uppity snobs." Ryoko pointed out.
"I am *NOT* an uppity snob!" Ayeka hollered at Ryoko. "Either you take that
back or I''ll ...
"You'll what? Punish me? I always knew you had the hots for me, Ayeka."

<Ayeka>Wha? (turns red)
<Ryoko>Don't you know, we're like, lesbians for each other in 9 out of ten
of these lame sex
fics for no reason at all.
<Ayeka>Oh. Hahahahhahahahhahhahahha!
<Ryoko>Hm, I guess it is sort of funny, isn't it?

Ayeka grabbed Ryoko and dragged her into Tenchi's hotel room.
"Ryoko's causing trouble again, Lord Tenchi. Please remove your pants so I
can teach her a lesson!"

<Ayeka>What is wrong with this picture?

Tenchi wasn't sure what Ayeka had in mind, but he wasn't about to argue with
her. He
certainly didn't want to be chased by those logs of hers again, so he
removed
his pants and undergarments and stood there with his manliness jutting out
before him.
It wasn't huge, but it was large enough to be impressive.

<Ayeka>It definately wasn't as huge as the guy's who wrote this is.
<Ryoko>Yeah, no comparison.
<Tenchi>You americans have . . . such big penis!

"Now, Ryoko, kneel in front of Tenchi." Ayeka ordered.
Ryoko shrugged and knelt before Tenchi.

<Ayeka>(as fic Ayeka)Tenchi, this is your new toilet.
<Ryoko>Um, no.

Ayeka took Tenchi's cock and guided the head into Ryoko's mouth. She began
to stroke the
shaft, seductively bringing Tenchi closer and closer to orgasm. Suddenly it
dawned on her
that she would be giving Tenchi's sperm to Ryoko if she continued. "WHAT AM
I
DOING?!" She gasped as she pulled Tenchi's cock out of Ryoko's mouth and put
it into her own.

<Ryoko>What sort of punishment is that exactly?
<Tenchi>It's part of the penal code.
<Ayeka>This incarnation of me seems a little. . . confused.
<Tenchi>A little?

*****

The trio woke the next morning and set out again on their task to get Achika
and Nobuyuki
together. Ryoko was almost at the door when the phone rang. She picked it
up.
"Hello, beautiful." A familiar yet different voice told her.

<Ryoko>How did he get my number? What d-
<Ayeka>*ahem*
<Ryoko>God, how many times am I going to do that?

"Stop pestering me." Ryoko snarled at him.
"Is that any way to talk to someone who stood up for you?"
"What are you on about?" Ryoko demanded.
"I told your boss that yesterday's incident was my fault. You got your job
back if you
still want it. Frankly, I think you're too pretty to be a waitress."
"Thanks for sticking up for me." Ryoko told him. "But if you think it'll get
you into my
bed you can just forget that idea."
"That's okay. Mine's more comfortable anyhow."
Ryoko screamed in exasperation and slammed the phone down.

<Ryoko>AS IF!!!!
<Ayeka>Hehe

*****

Ryoko slipped an aphrodisiac into the cup of iced tea she was getting ready
for
Nobuyuki. She'd noticed Achika playing footsie under the table with him, but
he was
anxious about something and hadn't been responding much. She then went to
get their
deserts from the freezer.

<Tenchi>Little did they know,it was poisoned and I was never born.
<Ayeka&Ryoko>NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!TTTEEEENNNNNCCCCHHHHHHIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!
<Tenchi>Hehe.

While she was gone, Mihoshi walked toward the door leading into the dining
hall
when she suddenly spilled a glass of ice-tea that she was carrying. Without
hesitating,
she picked up the cup Ryoko had poured and brought it out to the table she
was serving.
As luck would have it, the chestnut haired young man was the recipient of
the
drugged drink.
"Thank you." He told Mihoshi, taking a sip. He eyed it with momentary
suspicion, then
looked up at Mihoshi. "I think it needs just a touch of sugar." he
suggested.
"It's very good, mind you, but I like it a little sweeter."
"I'm sorry." Mihoshi sobbed.
"Oh... no... I don't mean you made it wrong. It was good you didn't make it
really sweet.
A person can always add more sugar to suit himself later that way. You did a
very good
job." '"Thank you!" Mihoshi gushed, proudly. "Oh thank you so much!" She
hugged the
chestnut haired young man tightly, then went into the kitchen where she saw
Ryoko
standing there, looking around.

<Tenchi>So Mihoshi is a slut?
<Ryoko>That's how it seems, doesn't it.
<Ayeka>I guess so.

"Mihoshi, you didn't take that cup of iced tea did you?"
"Uh huh."
"Who did you serve it to?"
Mihoshi pointed to the chestnut haired young man.
"I don't believe this! Him again! What is he, a punishment for my sins?!"

<Ryoko>What type of punishment? Because if it's the kind Ayeka thinks up,
it's ok.
<Ayeka>SHUT UP!!!

"Maybe he's your guardian angel?" Mihoshi suggested.
"Angel my butt." Ryoko huffed.
"Could you bring his dinner out to him?" Mihoshi pleaded. "I'm on my break
and
I'm hungry."
"You just gave him an aphrodisiac and now you're sending me to his table?
Not a chance!
I'm not going anywhere near him until that wears off."
The boss cleared his throat very insistantly and Ryoko found herself making
her way to
the young man's table.
The young man looked up at her, his eyes glistening from the drug. "You are
so
beautiful." he told her.
"Yes, I am." She agreed. "But you can't have me." She set his food down and
went over to Achika's table.

<Tenchi>Where they both lay dead.
<Ayeka>So you don't want to be born?
<Tenchi>My life sucks, so why not?
<Ayeka>Oh. I see.

"Are you ready to order?" She asked, helpfully.
"What are you doing, Miss Ryoko?" Ayeka bustled up to her and elbowed her
out of the
way. "This here is my table. You're supposed to be waiting on *him*" she
pointed over to
the young man Ryoko had just been with.
"You must be joking!" Ryoko protested.
"He is kind of cute." Achika encouraged her.
Ryoko stomped over to the chestnut-haired man's table.
"What do you want?" She griped
"I'd like to take you out back, space-pirate, and pump you for information."
he
muttered, feeling the affects of the drug more fully now.

<Ryoko>WHAT!!! So I'm about to have sex with someone I hardly know. Thank
you, author.
<Tenchi>Yeppp. That's how it seems does it not?
<Ryoko>Yeppp.

"What?" She glared at him.
"I'll just have a bowl of ramen." He amended.
"That's what I thought you said." Ryoko went into the kitchen to get the
young
man's order.

<Tenchi>So I was never born. The end.
<Ayeka>So why are you here?
<All>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
