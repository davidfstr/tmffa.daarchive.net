The Canal MSTs Part 2:  Follow Your Heart
By Paul "IrrCapT" Bernard

Kane Blueriver:(appears on screen) As we rejoin our heroes, they have been 
locked away on the Canal, forced to do MSTs to save the ship and themselves.  
There only hope, a brave and fearless adventurer who can repair the enigmatic 
computer...
Spike: WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE GUY WHO LOCKED US IN HERE!
Ryoga Hibiki: Brave and fearless, Ha!  More like braindead and clueless!
Kane: Then I just won't send down your new MSTer.
Lt. Yamamoto:  Huh?  If you can get people in here, why can't you get us out?
Kane: Well, Canal has latched on to you as the only thing that can help.  If
you try to leave, she will commit suicide rather than let you.  But, since you 
would eventually run out of MST materiel otherwise, I'm sending in one new 
person.  And so that Canal doesn't latch on to them, they can only come once.  
Sgt. Ota:  Who is it today?
Kane: Nanami Katsuhiko, come on down!
Nanami: (falling through a dimensional portal) I'm finally home!  Makoto, loo-
Makoto?  Where am I? 
Spike: A girl!
Ryoga: THANK YOU, THANK YOU (glomps Nanami)
Nanami: AAAH! Get off me!
Ryoga: If only this were Akane...*sigh*
Nanami: BAKANERO! (creams Ryoga)
Spike:(in player voice) Well, you took care of him fast, gorgeous.
Nanmi: Get away from me, CREAP! (sees Kane)  HEY! You were supposed to take me 
and Makoto home!
Kane: I lied.
Nanami: You-
Kane: It's MST time!
Nanmi: If you want me to MST, It'll take 3000 roshtals to get me into the theater.
Kane: I got news for you, you are already IN the theater. NOW SIT DOWN!
Nanami: (Sits down, and Ryoga and Spike sit on either side) UUUUNGH!  caught 
between two Hentai.
Spike: What eare we MSTing today? not that I'll be watching.
Kane: "Follow your heart" by R. Castillo.  Here we go!

Order from left to right: Lt. Yamamoto from Irresponsible Capitan Tylor, Ryoga
Hibiki from Ranma 1/2, Nanami Katsuhiko from El Hazard, Spike from Cowboy Bebop,

Tenchi Muyo Follow your heart

Chapter one

(After the 13th episode)

Ota: The cast killed themselves, the end!
Kane SIT DOWN!

        Tenchi is in the fields taking a break from work.  As he sits
under the shade of a nearby tree, he begins to contemplate about the
news he received this morning.  

Spike(doing a Tenchi Impression): Amagasaki stole both Ryoko and Aeka...
Yamamoto(doing a Tenchi Impression): Fics that are written in the 
present tense suck...
Ota(doing a Tenchi Impression): Kajishima is doing the final OAV series...
Ryoga(doing a Tenchi Impression): I got all the girls preganant...
Nanami(doing a Tenchi Impression): I....(turns to Ryoga)THAT IS SICK!
Spike: I apologize for him, he's a hentai.

<I  suppose it would be good to have them back, it's only been a 
couple of nonths since they visited.  I don't mind seeing my great 
grandmother, Lady Funaho.  But it's kind of different with Lady 
Misake and Emperor Asuza.  

Ota: What's wrong with Lady Misaki?

It's not that I don't like Lady Misake but those hugs of hers leave 
me bruised and gasping for air.  

Spike: Wuss...

I don't know about Emperor Asuza and whe he dislikes
me.  I have done nothing to upset him before except beat that Sergio
guy.  

Yamamoto: Sergio?  Sergio Leone?
Spike: (shrugs) I guess Azusa liked "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"
Yamamoto: Yeah, but isn't he a little old?

Well I night as well start heading back home and prepare for
their arrival tomorrow. >

Ota(doing a Tenchi Impression):  Fortify the house, activate the land mines,
get the military firepower...did I forget anything?
Nanami: hrmmm...nope! 
Yamamoto: Except for tranquilizing Aeka and Sasami.

  As Tenchi begins to stand-up he is shocked by the familiar sound of 
one persons voice.

Yamomoto:  Hi!  I'm Mr. Jumpteguard, your third grade english teacher.  Do you 
remember me? I'm here to deliver an injunction so that you don't mangle the 
english language any more!

        "Tenchi."
        "Ryoko, what are you doing here?"  asks Tenchi as he turns around to 
face her.
        "Sorry to have scared you, but Sasami sent me to inform you that lunch 
will be ready in about 30 minutes."

Ota: So report there at 1200 hours, MOVE IT SOLDIER!

        "What?  Uh...Sorry about that Ryoko."

Spike: What is he apologizing for?
Yamamoto: Better question, why is Ryoko apologizing?

        "Is something bothering you Tenchi?  You looked as if you were in 
a trance when I first called you a few seconds ago."

Ryoga(doing a Tenchi Impression): No, I was just receving the hypnotic 
command to kill you all.  No need to worry.

        "Well, uh..."
        "Come on Tenchi, you can tell me.  You never know, I might be
able to help you."
        "Ok Ryoko.  I was just wondering why the royal family is comming
back.  Also, why is it that the Emperor seems to dislike me."

Nanami: And the answers are, I don't know, and you can't form a gramatic 
sentence!

        "Tenchi, the emperor is afraid that you will take over the throne
one of these days.  

Spike: And then you will bring the empire to it's knees through mismanagement.
Ota: Hey, he isn't THAT bad.
Rest of the Cast: YES HE IS!
Yamamoto: On a related note, how does RYOKO know so much about Jurai nobility?

Expecially since Ayeka has refused the previous suiters he has sent for her 
to meet.  If you would like for him to stop hating you so much, you should 
choose me over Ayeka."
        Shaking his head, Tenchi replies "Ryoko, if I do that Misake will
do more that bruise a couple of my ribs."

Yamamoto: and that's the ONLY reason that you don't want to choose yet?

        "Well the maybe we should just elope.  That way we could beave all
our troubles behind here on earth as we travel thourgh the stars
together.  It would be kind of like having a permanent honeymoon,
wouldn't you agree Tenchi."  As Ryoko said this, she closed her eyes
and dreamt of how it would be like if it really did happen.

Nanami: Wouldn't Ryoko be hugging Tenchi at this point?
Spike: Yes, like this. (glomps and feels up Nanami)
Nanami: Aaaaah! Get off me you baka hentai!  Does anyone have a crowbar?
Ryoga: Hey Spike!  Leave some for me!
Nanami: (smacks them both on the head with the Mystical Hentai Mattet.) 

        Tenchi's only response was, "I can not do that Ryoko."  

Spike: AIC want's to milk 3 more seasons out of this franchise.

Immediately, Ryoko felt as if he stabbed her in the heart.  As he 
looked at Ryoko, he noticed the sad expression on her face caused by his 
response.  Not wanting to see her hurt he ads,

Yamamoto(doing a Tenchi impression): I wish I could stay in a single tense.

 "Ryoko its not that I would hate to travel with you.  In fact, I do like 
the idea of traveling in space, but I do not wish to hurt either you or Ayeka."

Spike: What's with the formal speech?  Has Tenchi been taking speaking lessons?
Nanami: With his grammar? No.
Ota: What is this with you and grammar?
Nanami: I'm a reporter.  You only say a few gramatical embaressments on camera 
before you learn to notice and correct grammatical errors.

        Ryoko begins to smile as Tenchi says this and holds his arm in a
gentle embrace.  Tenchi begins to feel at ease as she smiles while holding
his arm and resting her head on his shoulder.  After a minute of holding
on to him, Ryoko asks, "Tenchi is it alright if we walk home together, I
promise not to do anything except hold you hand if you let me?"

Spike: Wha?
Ota: Eh?
Ryoga: Huh?

        "Don't you think Ayeka will get mad if she sees us hollding each
others hand?"  Replies Tenchi, as a sweat drop forms on his head as the
image of Ayeka becoming mad develops within his mind.
        Ryoko answered softly, "I don't want to thing about her right now, I
just want to enjoy a nice leisurely walk with you."

Yamamoto: Thing?
Nanami: You know, when we make noises at eachother so that we can understand 
what the other is thinking?  Umm, what's it called? Oh yeah, Talking!
Ota: THINGY!
Nanami: Huh?
Ota: Our last MSTing.  You'd have to have been there to understand.

        Surprised by Ryoko's gentle form of affection he looks into her
eyes.
<She looks very beautiful when she smiles.  It's almost as if Ryoko truns
into a different person when she is like this.

Yamamoto: What, when the author changes her personality?

  It's strange but she reminds me of some one from a long time ago. >

Spike: Yeah, like Aeka from episode 3!
  
After reacquiring his thoughts, Tenchi gives her an answer.  "Ok Ryoko, I'd be 
honored to walk home with you."
        Ryoko is in an all time high as her heartbeats faster from hearing
Tenchi's response that tears start running down her face.  Noticing the
tears, Tenchi asks, "Ryoko, why are you crying, are you hurt."

Spike: ....Okay, Tenchi isn't THIS clueless.
Ota: Yeah.

        Shaking her head, she replies.  "No Tenchi, I'm fine it's just that
I'm so happy you did not reject my request.  I'll be fine in a minute."

Spike(doing a Tenchi Impression): Ryoko, why are you talking like Aeka?
Nanami(doing an Aeka impression): Because I really am Aeka!

        Tenchi gently embraces Ryoko as he attempts to help calm her down.
"Do you feel better now, Ryoko?"
        "Y...Yes Tenchi, but if do not get home soon lunch will get cold and
Sasami will be mad at us."
        Tenchi nods his head in response and both start to walk home.

**************************(Back at the house)*************************

        "Ayeka, lunch is almost ready could you please set the table."
Yelled Sasami from the kitchen.
        Ayeka stops looking through her wardrove where she attempted to
find something to wear for tomorrow's arrival.  <Sasami has been spending
too much time with that monster woman, 

Spike: Bitchified Aeka sense, TINGLING!
Ota: Is that like your B-movie sense?
Sipke: Yes, I have a super power that tells me when any bad cliche plot 
ideas are coming up.

she is even starting to pick some of her habits.  Where is Ryoko anyway she
should be doing that instead of me.

Ryoga: Doing what?
Nanami: I dunno.

  I'll bet she is still asleep somewhere while we are doing chores.
How in the world Tenchi puts up with that good for nothing-useless
creature is beyond my comprehension. 

Spike: Okay, it's official.  This is a bitchified Aeka.  My cliche plot idea
sense is so strong it's giving me a headache 
Nanami: (takes out a bottle of pills) I have a bottle of Asprin.
Spike: Why thank you, beautiful. (Takes the bottle and swallows a couple)
Nanami: That'll be 700 roshtals
Spike: B-But I dont have any roshtals
Nanami: Sorry, I don't do currency conversions.  Now, what'll it be?  It's 
either the money or I reposess your gun.
Spike: But...but...
Nanami: (takes the gun) Thank you!

Well I might as well go down and help out. >  When she reaches the kitchen,
Ayeka sees both Sasami and Mihoshi busy preparing lunch while Ryo-Oki in 
humanoid form is holding a basket of vegetables next to Sasami.  "Sasami, you 
shouldn't yell like that it is most undignified.  

Ota: Oh, this is worse.  Bitchified, SNOBBY Aeka!

Besides, why didn't you ask that worthless Ryoko?  I was busy preparing for 
our parents arrival tomorrow."
        Sasami lowers her head as she converses with her sister.

Ryoga(doing a good Sasami impression): Aeka, I think you shold take something for 
your PMS before they come.
Nanami: What the?  How the hell do you do that?
Spike: Freaky, isn't it?

  "I'm sorry Ayeka, but I had already asked Ryoko to inform Tenchi that lunch
would soon be ready."
        "YOU DID WHAT!?  How could you ask that monster to go near my
Tenchi?  She is probably seducing Tenchi right now.  I must go and save
Lord Tenchi from that monster woman."  Ayeka protests as she runs out to
look for Tenchi.

Ota: OKAY! We get the point.  You think Aeka is a bitch.  You don't have to
demonstraight it every sentince!
Spike: Of course he does.  He's an AHRLI.

        Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ryo-Oki stare for a few moments at the empty
spot where Ayeka was standing before they resume with the meal
preparation.

Nanami(doing a Mihoshi impression):  Aeka is acting odd today, isn't she?
Ota: Hell yes!

        Ayeka stops at the front door when she sees Tenchi in front of her.
"Welcome back Lord Tenchi, I would have gone to...ack!"  This is as far as
Ayeka got when she noticed that Tenchi and Ryoko were holding hands.

Spike: At which point the actress playing the Bitch Aeka had a heart attack
and died, and the author was forced to get a actress who could play her better.
Ota: And there was much rejoicing.
Cast: Yay!
Ryoga: Right, you wish!

Horrified by the sight in front to her Ayeka could not say another word.
<Has Tenchi chosen Ryoko.  No, this can't be there is no way he could have
picked that monster woman over me. >  

Ryoga(doing an Aeka impression): There is no spoon, there is no spoon...
Spike: no, wrong chant.  Repeat after me.  There is no fic, there is no fic!

Determined to get an answer, Ayeka
shouts, "What is the meaning of this Ryoko!!!  What trick did you use to
seduce Lord Tenchi in order to get him to touch someone like you!"

Ota: Where do authors get this?  Aeka has acted this way maybe ONCE, and 
she was drunk at the time!
Nanami: You don't expect that Aeka-bashers work on logic, do you?

        "Please Miss Ayeka, it's not what you think."
        "Quiet Tenchi this does not concern you", shapped Ayeka.  Determined
to fight against Ryoko, she would not let anyone get in her way.
        Ryoko slowly let go of Tenchi's hand as Ayeka's false charge of
seducing Tenchi began to upset her.

Ota: OH YEAH!!!  It's FIGHT time!
Nanami: Aren't you upset about this?  It's another bad assumption.
Ryoga: No, he just likes to watch combat. 

  While still calm, Ryoko replied, "Ok little princess, what is your problem".

Cast: (Blinks)
Ryoga(Imitating Ryoko): I would like a free-thought dialouge about your relationship
between ourselves and Tenchi.  How do you fell about your mother?

  Not able to control her rage anymore, Ayeka bellowed,  "You're the problem 
you slut!  Everyday you keep trying to seduce Lord Tenchi with you antics.  
I am tired of it all and I'm goning to show you a lesson you'll soon not forget!"

Yamamoto: And I'M gonna teach you how to write grammatically!

        As a cocky smile developed of Ryoko's face, she simply replies,  "Is
that so.  If you remember correctly, I brought your precious Juraian Empire
down to its knees last time.  

Spike: Was that when she FAILED in her mission for Kagato?  Being chased 
away by Yosho does not constitiute bringing an empire to it's knees.

So I doubt you can do any damage to me little princess."

Nanami: And the pain she gave you when she sealed you away seems to gone 
out of the authors mind.

        In an instant Ayeka's mini logs appeared everywhere.  As with all
their previous fights, Tenchi asks both ladies to stop in the hope they can
resolve the matter differentyly.  Surprisingly to him, Ryoko is th eonly one
to respond to his request with a smile.  "Don't worry Tenchi, I'n not going
to strike at Ayeka unless you want me to."

Cast: (blinks) WHAT!!!!!
Spike: Okay, who has been slipping Ryoko Vallium?!
Nanami: The same person who has been slipping Aeka uppers. 
Ryoga(imitating Ryoko): Because violence is only a external result of interal 
emotional termoil.  Let's channel our agressive tendancies elsewhere.
Spike: That was a public service announcement by Ryoga Hibiki.

        Immediately, Ayeka throws several energy balls at Ryoko while
laughing menacingly.  "Take this and this you hussy.  I'll show you to mess
around with my Tenchi." 

Ota: The author forgot to make her a fire breathing dragon.
Spike: I think he's saving that for a later chapter.

In the meantime Ryoko is dodging all of Ayeka's attacks without fighting back.
Once seeing that her attacks were futile, Ayeka uses a different tactic and calls 
her guardians into action.  "Azaka, Kamadakie seize that vile creature!"  Without 
warning both guardians flank Ryoko and imprison her in their force field.

Yamamoto: I was going to comment, but there is nothing more to say about how bad 
Aeka's characterization is.

  Ayeka begins to laugh as she sees Ryoko struggleing to get out of her grardians 
forcefield.  Slowly walking toward Ryoko, Ayeka remarks, "did you think you could 
have eluded me forever Ryoko?  It was only a matter of time before I got the better of
you.  And now that I do, I will make you pay for what you have done to Lord
Tenchi.  You Bitch!!!"

Nanami(doing an Aeka impression): Because I am really the bounty hunter, NAGI!
Ryoga: Isn't she in the OTHER continuity?
Nanami: If he can get away with warping the series, why can't I?

        "Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko lunch is ready", announced Sasami.

Ota: And that was another random comment, brought to you by Sasami Jurai

        "Not now Sasami, I am in the process of teaching this monster a
lesson in manners!",

Yamamoto(in a BAD Aeka impression): Now this is your salad fork, and you 
use this spoon to eat soup.

 bellowed Ayeka.  "Now Ryoko, I will teach you how to properly
show respect for a member of the hourse of Jurai and their property.

Yamamoto: AAAAIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Ryoga: What's wrong with him?
Ota: I think that the bad grammar has finally driven him insane.
Yamamoto: (waggling his finger in front of his mouth) bebebebebebebebebebebebebe
bebebebebebeb.
Nanami: I think we need to take a break...
Kane: Yeah.

(the screen turns off)
Nanami: I'll try to get him to stop that.
Yamamoto:  Googagaga. Ebie!
Ryoga&Spike: I'll help!
Nanami:  Stay away from me you hentai. (drags Yamamoto off)
Spike: Dammit.
Ota: When will you guys learn?
Spike: She is the only real woman we've seen for 2 weeks!  Don't you want
to do something with her?
Ota: Yes I do, but I'm using the strategy of letting the others make idiots
of themselves and then making my move.  Why don't you try it?
Spike: Thats an idea.
Ryoga: What are you talking about?
Ota&Spike: Nothing.
Nanami: I think he's okay now.
Yamamoto: (Comes back wet with a kiss on his cheek) Yep, I'm better
Ota: (aside to Spike) See what I mean?
Spike: (aside to Ota) Yes, I do.
Kane: Back to the fic!
(screen comes back on)

        "Not now Sasami, I am in the process of teaching this monster a
lesson in manners!", bellowed Ayeka.  "Now Ryoko, I will teach you how to properly
show respect for a member of the hourse of Jurai and their property.
Observing the look on Ayeka's face, Ryoko notices that she is holding
Tenchi-ken in her hand.

Spike: Whoa, maybe I was wrong!  If the author had Tenchi give Aeka the sword, 
maybe he isn't a AHRLI, he is a RHALI!
Nanami: Wanna bet?
Spike: No.

  Before she is able to say anytin, Ayeka sams the hilt of Tenchi-ken onto her 
chest.  Causing, Ryoko's body to kick wildly as she screams at the top of her 
lungs from teh pain inflicted by Tenchi-kens' energy discharge.

Yamamoto: What, there is more than one Master Key?

        Tenchi's world slowed down for a second

Spike: OKAY, who's playing with the remote control?
Kane: (appears on screen) Sorry.
Spike: STOP IT!

 as the sight of Ryoko kicking wildly from the pain caused by Tenchi-ken, 
shocked him.  For a few brief seconds, he viewed his movements in slow motion 
as he tried to stop Ayeka.  "NO!!!  Ayeka stop!"  Shouted Tenchi as he ran 
towards Ayeka and life resumed to is normal speed.

Spike: Kane, I TOLD YOU TO STOP THAT!
Kane: Like I care.

        "No Tenchi this has gone on for far to long.  I must do some thing
to stop it before it goes any further", responded Ayeka as she jabbed Ryoko
with Tenchi-ken once more.  Tyoko unable to stay conscious,

Yamamoto: The city fainted.  Ryoko, on the otherhand....

as the pain overtook her body once more was unable to see Tenchi advance on Ayeka.
She was barely able to whisper

Yamamoto(in a breathy whisper): Rosebud....

 Tenchi's name before she fell unconscious.
        Tenchi felt a sharp pain with-in his heart an instant before he
grabbed Ayeka's arm and pulled her away from Ryoko's smoking body.  
Remembering the sensation he once experienced when she was in danger from 
Dr. Clay, 

Nanami: What was this?
Spike: I Dunno.

Tenchi wasted no time in seeing to her safety.  "AZAKA, KAMADAKIE TAKE RYOKO TO
WASHU'S LAB NOW!!!"  Bellowed Tenchi as he took Tenchi-ken from Ayeka's
hands.  

Nanami: Well, if you hadn't given her the Tenchi-ken, this would never have happened.
Yamamoto: Why do you keep saying that Tenchi gave her the Tenchi-ken?
Nanami: How else would she get it?
Yamamoto: Point.

Once seeing Ryoko's limp form being carried by the guardians, Sasami
began to cry as she followed them into Washu's lab with Mishoshi walking
next to her.
        "Ayeka, why did you do this?  This incident could have been avoided
if you had given me a chance to explain the situation.  But as usual, both you
and Ryoko fight with no thought of wht might happen to either of you or
anyone else.  For what, just to see which one of you can claim me as their suitor."

Nanami: Well, the author got ONE thing right, Tenchi wouldn't like one of the girls
trying to kill the other...
Spike: Somehow, I think that if the situation was reversed, the author would 
be cheering.

        "I...I'm sorry Tenchi."
        "Ayeka, you should be saying that to Ryoko not me."
        "Why should I!  She is the cause of all this mess.  If she had not
tried to seduce you every time she is near you, I would not have acted as I did."

Ryoga: Bitch.
Nanami: (Slaps Ryoga)SNAP OUT OF IT!
Ryoga: (shakes himself)Sorry, this fic is getting to me.

        "Ayeka...Ryoko did not seduce me as you claim.  She asked me if I
would grant her permission to hold my hand while we walked home.  And I said yes."
        Instantly, Ayeka stares back shocked by Tenchi's response.  Then she
slowly begins looking down as she slowly replies.  "S...So, you have chosen
Ryoko."  Then lifting her head, she screams.  

Spike: Evil demon Aeka transform in 5..4..3..2..1
Ota(imitating bad dub): Look...it's...Godzilla.
Spike(imitating a bad dub): No, it's...worse.  It's a...Bitchified...Aeka.
Oto(imitating a bad dub): Flee...in terror.

"Why Tenchi!  Why!  She...she doesn't love you as I do!  A creature like 
her does not know the meaning of love nor could she be able to express it 
with someone.  Can't you see that she will only use you for now and leave 
you when she is through with you!"

Spike: She didn't change?!
Ota: I think your plot sense went of for an increase in bitchification 
rather than a evil demon change.

        "Stop it Ayeka!!!"
        Closing his eyes, Tenchi continues to say.  "I'm sorry for my
behavior right now Ayeka.  I...I just wish the both of you could settle your
differences peacefully and become friends.

Yamamoto: EARTH TO AUTHOR!  They already HAVE!  You just decided to 
omit that part!

Before something like this happens again and I lose one of you.  Both of you 
are special to me, in your own ways. That is why I can not bear to see either 
of you hurt yourselves.  I will make a decision someday but not right now."  
With that said, Tenchi walks back into the house to check on Ryoko.

********************************(Washu's Lab)*******************************

        "She's fine Tenchi.  There was no serious damage done to her,
especially that which the greatest scientific genius in the Universe can not fix."  < I
hope he belives this lie.  I don't want to tell him that I almost lost her a
couple of times.  Its a good thing that there are only a couple of ways in
which Ryoko can be destroyed.  Although most ot those methods will work only if
Ryoko is willing to let them prevail.>
      
Nanami: So Ryoko can't be killed unless she wants to be......
Spike: Rrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.  Who's next in line for godlike powers that don't 
fit the events in the series?

        Being relived by Washu's response Tenchi asks, "Can I see her?"
        Seeing both the pain an relief with-in Tenchi's eyes, Washu nods her
head.  "She's resting at the moment but I'm pretty sure she would want you to be
near her."
       "Thank you Washu-chan."

******************************(Ryoko's dream)******************************

        As Ryoko rests within Washu's lab recovering from her injuries she
begins to have a dream, which has constantly plagued her over the past few nights.

Yamamoto(imitating Ryoko): I can't rember which one is the salad fork!
Ota(imitating Ryoko): Aeka's being taken by rubber lizard thingys!
Spike(imitating Ryoko): I'm fighting Kagato.  Wait, I'm naked!
Ryoga(imitating Ryoko): I have to have sex with both Amagsaki AND Serigo!
Nanami(imitating Ryoko): I'm-You mean Seriyo, you baka hentai! 

        It is one where she is finally able to speak with Tenchi privately, but the
mood is not a happy one.  "Why is it that you fear me Tenchi?  When I first saw
you I could feel there was something special about you.   But I would never have
thought it possible for me to have these types of feeling for someone, let
alone express them.  

Ryoga: Really?  Getting naked isn't an expression of emotions?
Nanami: (smacks him with the Mystical Hentai Mallet)

But every time I'd see you go near the cave where I was
imprisoned, my soul would be filled with happiness.  Even though you never
noticed me, I was always there admiring you from a distance.  

Yamamoto: Written that way, it makes Ryoko sound like a stalker!

I was happy with this until it all changed.  The first time you meet me, 
I frightened you off with my appearance.  And the second time it was my 
actions, which frightened you even further away from me.  

Spike: THEN WHY DID YOU DO THEM?

At the time, 
I wanted to express both my emotions and actions in a way,which I felt was 
right.  

Ota: And attacking the one that you love is the right thing.  HOW DO YOU FIGURE?!

I can not forget those days because they represent the time my world 
went into ciaos

Spike: Ciao is right!  See-ya.
Kane: You cant leave, remember?
Spike: Damn it!

once more.  I wish I could change the past, because you only see me now as 
a monster that might hurt you.  Even thought there are times I want to leave 
so as to ease the pain I seem to inflict on you, I can not.  

Ryoga (imitating Ryoko): Because I can't find my car keys.

That is because 
I want to make sure you're safe at all times.  Tenchi, I will do everything and 
anything in order to protect you, but please don't leave me alone."  

Ryoga: (pulls out a book titled "Ryoko+Tenchi cliche fan fic writer's manual") 
Hmmmmm....Since this is a dream, I think that Tenchi will walk away from her after 
the "I love you and want to protect you" soliloquy.
Spike: Yup, and that will come in 5..4..3..2..1

As Tenchi turns around he begins to fade away from her.  "Don't leave me Tenchiiiii!", 
screams Ryoko, as she desperately tries to grab a hold of him before he is gone.

Ota: Wow!  Can I look in that book?
Ryoga: You DON'T wanna see what will probably come later...
Ota: Point.

        Ryoko wakes up slowly not wanting to see if her dream came true.  At
first confused by her surroundings, Ryoko looks around and notices that
she's inside Washu's lab.  Being relived she is not someplace unknown to her, she
checks to see if there are any restraints on her.  Once she is satisfied
there is nothing holding her back she teleports herself out to the living room.

*****************************(Tenchi's room)********************************

        Tenchi is unable to sleep due to the constant reminder of Ryoko and
Ayeka's battle in the afternoon.  To his recollection this was the first
time that Ryoko did not fight back in her usual manner.  

Spike: No sh...
Nanami: (slaps a hand over his mouth) No swearing!  If you want to say that
say it this way.  (hands him a slip of paper)
Spike: (reading) Can't we get this author on a game show?  Next contestant, 
R. Castillo, area of specialty, the bleeding obvious!....What's this from?
Nanami: Faulty Towers.

This was a big surprise
to him since he had asked both girls not to fight during most of their
previous battles and Ryoko was the only one to comply with his request this time.

Kane: I'm detecting a rebuke for Aeka.....
Spike: (sarcastically) Naw, really! 

<Why did I not stop them from the beginning when I had the chance?  It is because
of me that Ryoko got injured today.  I should never have let this happen. >
        After several long minutes of replaying the day's events in his
mind. Tenchi dedides to head for the kitchen and get a snack.  

Spike: Little does he know that we have a live giant octopus and a camera 
in the fridge.  Let's see how fast he dies.

While he is descending the stairwell he notices that the front door is slightly 
open.  As he approaches the door in order to close it he begins to hear the faint 
sound of music coming from outside.  As he looks outside, he sees a figure, which
appears to be dancing by itself on the dock.  

Ryoga:(looking in the manual) Ghost of his dead mother telling him to 
marry Ryoko?
Spike: (looking over his shoulder) Or Ryoko herself.

After a little bit of time he is able to tell it is Ryoko.

Yamamoto: Sheesh, couldn't the author have been a little less predictable.

  While he walks towards her, he begins to remember where he had first heard
 this particular musical piece.  <I believe, I've heard this one before in my 
physical education class a couple of years ago.  Our professor was showing us
 some form of dance called a waltz.  

Spike: (blinks)Why was Tenchi learning the waltz in P.E.?
Ryoga: My guess is a gay gym instructor.

If I'm not mistaken this is the Waltz from 'The Sleeping Beauty' by Tchaikovsky. >

Yamamoto: You can barely remeber what a Waltz is, but you instantly know what 
the music is?  OKAAAAAAAAAAY.

Mesmerized by both the music and Ryoko's dancing ability, Tenchi could only 
look at her and smile as he walked towards her.

Ryoga: As he got an erection, he took off his belt and...
Nanami: (Smack him with the Mystical Hentai mallet)  Stop that!

        When the music stopped playing, Tyoko was shocked to see Tenchi
looking at her.  Causing her to instantly turn several shades of red, as she 
became embarrassed to be seen by him in such a manner.  

Spike:...She's embarressed when he sees her in a dress, but not when she is 
nude....
Nanami: Like I said before, I think that Aeka is impersonating Ryoko in this fic.

Noticing her blushing reaction, Tenchi slowly responds.  "I...I'm sorry if 
I scared you Ryoko, I did not mean to interrupt you.  But I do want to 
apologize for my lack of behavior today."

Yamamoto: (Opens his mouth)
Spike: Look, you comments are getting old.  Let's just agree that he can't write 
and leave it at that.
Yamamoto: (in a whiney voice) Fine.

        Instantly Ryoko replies, "What do you mean Tenchi?"
        "I mean the fight between you and Ayeka."
        "Oh.  You mean that, its ok Tenchi both Ayeka and I are used to
these types of arguments."

Ryoga(doing a Ryoko impression): Yeah, she tries to kill me every day!

        "Its not alright.  I should have stoped Ayeka before the argument
escalated and told her that you did nothing wrong.  You never seduced me
into holding your hand, you asked me for my permission.  Ryoko, you know
that I have never interfered in your arguments even when she start to
insult you.  

Yamamoto: And she has insulted Aeka too, don't forget.
Spike: Of course he forgot.  He god moded her.  That entails editing 
any negative things out of her personality.

I'm sorry that such things have happened before, but I'll
try to make sure that it does not happen around here anymore.  You are
a guest in my family's house and when I allow her or anyone to treat you
in such a manner it brings shame to both my family and myself."

Nanami: Yeah, Yeah, and Aeka is a bitch.  Jeez, when will this fic end!
Yamamoto(immitating Tenchi): And so I shall commit Seppuku rather than 
insult Aeka by being in this fic anymore!

        "Thank you Tenchi.  I'll try to kelp out around the house more so
you won't think I'm freeloading on your account."
        "Ryoko that would be nice but all I want is for you and Ayeka to
work out whatever problems you might have had and become friends."
        "Ok Tenchi.  I'll do as you ask, but only because I love you so much
that I will do whatever it takes to make you happy."

Ryoga(imitating Ryoko): Yeah, I'll just let you stay totally clueless to the 
fact that we are friends and lesbi-
Nanami: You say it and your two little friends die...
Ryoga:(sweatdrops)
Spike: (sings) SO happy togetherrrr..
Ota:(slaps a hand over Spike's mouth) No singing.

        "Thank you Ryoko, this means alot to me."
        With a smile on her face, Ryoko leans forward and whispers softly
into his ear.  "Tenchi.  I also have a favor to ask of you."
        By reaction, he jumps back from her, making her expression turn from
cheerful toward one of misery.  

Ryoga: I think we need to dialouge about Washu.  Ryoko has become Manic-
Depressive.

Immediately seeing her facial
characteristics change, Tenchi scolds himself.  <Why did I have to hurt her 
again after all I said?  

Ota: I'm still trying to figure out why he jumped back at the question.
Nanami: Because most of the questions she ask involve taking clothing off.
Ota: But, since he changed her personality, doesn't that mean that he thinks 
that she wouldn't ask those sort of questions?
Nanami: Normally, yes.  But I think that the author secretly is admitting to 
himself that this is a changed Ryoko.
Ota: Then why doesn't he change her back?
Nanami: Because then he feels that she isn't nice enough to get Tenchi.

She has never done anything to hurt me.  Even when she was playing around
with me at school after I released her from the cave.  Sure she scarred the 
crap out of me but she never came close to harming me.  

Spike: She backed you down a flight of stairs, blasted you with energy bolts, threw
you through the air in two explosions and straight armed you in the face.  If you 
don't call that trying to hurt someone, I don't know what is!

Since then she has 
gone out of her way to show me how much she loves and cares for me.  Even 
though I'm not yet comfortable having so much attention flaunted
on me by one single person.  I have to make this up to her and make sure it
never happens again.  Its time for some changes around here and I might as well
start now.>  

Spike: Groan...why is it that AHRLIs think that Tenchi has been execively cruel
to Ryoko?
Yamamoto: Because he didn't choose her immediately and they worship her as a goddess.
Ryoga: This guy worships her, that's for sure.

"I'm sorry about that Ryoko.  Old habits are hard to bread but I'll work on it, 
I promise."
        With a smile on her face once more, she replies.  "Yes you do have
to work on that Tenchi.  But I have one thing to say.  I'm tired of dancing by
myself.  Would you like to dance with me?  I've been practicing for some
time now so I won't step on your feet like I did last time when you
practiced by the cave."

Yamamoto: When was this?
Nanami: About the same time that Ryoko and Aeka changed their personalities, 
Tenchi and Ryoko got Waltz lessons, and the world started revolving around Ryoko.
Yamamoto: Oh.

        Tenchi simply bows and responds, "It would be my pleasure to dance
with you Ryoko."  As he extends his hand you to her, she does a curtsy in reply.
As they both walk to the middle of the dock, Johann Strauss', 'The Blue
Danube' begins to play.  

Spike: Okay, who is projecting this music, and why aren't the characters nervous
that music is coming from thin air?
Ota: I dunno.  Maybe the author geave a sound projection power to Ryoko along with 
the immortality.

They begin the waltz with a simple box step.  As the music
progressed so did their moves.  It wasn't long before Ryoko, was being
twirled around by Tenchi and moving into more advanced steps.  Their moves were
flawless as they glided through the dock with such ease that it would make
any ball room dance instructor proud to have them as students.  

Yamamoto: Too bad they were students, and Tenchi HASN"T been practicing!
Spike: Don't you know? The power of love can both save the world AND make you a 
better dancer!

Half way through the music Ryoko began to levitate both Tenchi and herself a 
few inches off the dock.  Tenchi did not mind this since it helped their movement's flow
better. Then, with Tenchi's approval she proceeded to levitate them onto the surface
of the lake.  As they neared the middle, the lake surface reflected the
stars in the sky like a mirror.  As the beauty of the atmosphere surrounded them,
both Tenchi and Ryoko began to lose themselves in thought. 

Yamamoto: And therefore stepped on each others toes alot before being dunked into the 
lake when Ryoko lost her concentration.

<Tenchi it this a dream?  Are you really with me at this moment?  If this is a dream, I
never want to wake-up unless I am in your arms like this.  And if this is for
real, I want to treasure this moment forever.>  <She looks so beautiful,  her
eyes, I love the way her eyes look when the moonlight shines within them.  It's
almost as if I could see within her and read her thoughts.  I can't imagine
what I would do if I were to have lost her today.  Wait a minute, Ryoko said
she danced with me before.  

Spike(immitating Tenchi): WHEN THE HELL DID THAT HAPPEN!

The only times I ever dance were in gym class
and once by the cave...Ryoko's cave.  So it was her?  She was the one that would
always make me feel safe and at ease when I was by the cave all those years.

Nanami: Jeez, why is it that authors have to establish some sort of fate thing 
between Ryoko and Tenchi?  Or add events to the past to make Tenchi choose Ryoko?
Ota: So they can rub it in Aeka's face in their fantasies.

I never thought of her as a demon when I was a kid.  She was more like a
friend all those years I played by her cave.  

Spike: Get a clue! Stop changing the series.  He COULDN"T see her after about 4!

But now, she is more than a friend to
me, in fact I...I>  Looking into Ryoko's eyes, Tenchi moves closer to her
and simply says, "I love you Ryoko".  Ryoko does not get a chance to respond as
Tenchi caresses her face with his right hand as he moves in closer and
kisses her.  When he finally pulls away, Ryoko replies, "I love you too, my
Tenchi". They both hold on to each other with a gentle embrace as they look into each
other's eyes and begin to kiss once more as the music finishes.

*********************************(Washu's lab)******************************

        Washu'chan looks into the computer screen with tears on her face.

Spike: Okay, that explains who, but not why they weren't freaked by the music.

"Good luck to both of you.  I'm glad you were finally able to find the love you
had for each other and express it.  Now the interesting part will be to see how
Ayeka and the Jurian nobility handle this new situation."

Spike: Why do I get this ominous feeling that this fic series is leading up to Aeka 
attacking Ryoko and Tenchi...
Yamamoto: Because it is.

The End

Cast: YAAAAAY!
Spike: Thank god that's over.
Ryoga: Yes, the phychological effects upon my superego shall be long 
lasting.
Ota: Stop talking like that!
Ryoga: I would sincerely wish to, but I have devloped a fixation that 
I cannot control.  Assist me!
Kane: Okay, (opens a dimensional portal over Ryoga and drops a bucket 
of cold water on him) 
Ryoga: Squeee!
Spike: He turns into a pig! Cool!
Nanami: well, it's time for me to leave?
Spike: Yes, and I'm sorry I was such a jerk.  Can I see you again?
Nanami: No.  Your just too creepy.
Spike: B-But I was nice!
Ota: And so was I! Can I see you again?
Nanami: Sorry guys, but I only have feelings for Makoto.  
Spike: But you kissed HIM! 
Yamamoto: Hey!
Nanmi: Yeah, because he promised to protect me from you and Ryoga.
Bye!
Kane: Bye Nanami! (opens a dimensional portal below her)  
Ota: Damn, it didn't work.  Sorry Spike.....Spike?
Spike: OOOOOOOOOTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Ota: Uhoh! (runs)
Spike: Where's my gun!
Yamamoto: She took it.
Spike: Damn it!

THE END

hope you enjoyed it!
