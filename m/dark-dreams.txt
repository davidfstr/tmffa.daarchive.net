Darkened Dreams
By Steve Garret
MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans

What can I say? I've done so many *big* fan fics that I figured that I do a
few small ones for a bit. MSTing those big fan fics can really test your
imagination for all it's worth! Anyhow, this is my fifteenth fanfic MSTied
and I am still getting good comments... except for the author of that FF7
Thanksgiving fanfic who wrote in and told me that FF7 was made in Europe.
Hmm... Gee, if it was made in Europe then why are all those Japanese names
doing on the end credits of the game?

Legal Stuff: Mystery Science Theater 3000 belongs and all characters and
concepts belongs to Best Brains Inc. This piece of... work belongs to Steve
Garrett and he's welcomed to it.

Now.... Oop! Almost forgot. Be careful for what you are about to read is a
lemon and even though it is MSTied and the yucky parts taken out, it still
has quite a bit of nasty stuff.

Now, on with the show!
________________________________________________________________________
Deep below the surface of the Earth, in an infamous lab known only as Deep
13, TV's Frank and Dr. Clayton Forrester, would be conquerors of the world,
concentrated on the task at hand.

"Should we do it," Frank asked, eyes wide with fear.

"Of course we should. After all, we're evil," the scientist replied.

Frank sighed and walked over to the control board of the Fanfic Transporter,
rapidly typing in commands.

"I said they would pay for getting the phone company to disconnect my line
and they shall! BWahahaha," Dr. Forrester said, tossing the three sheets of
paper onto the Fanfic Transporter.

Frank looked at him and the scientist nodded. Tapping a button marked *GO*,
the fanfic disappeared in a swirl of blue energy.

SATELLITE OF LOVE

High above the Earth, Mike yawned and sipped at his coffee, grimacing
slightly at the taste. He would have to change the filter pretty soon.

"Hi Mike," came a tired sounding voice.

The temp looked to the source of the voice and saw that it was Tom Servo
coming onto the bridge from the right.

"Burning the midnight oil eh," came a second voice, which Mike recognized as
Crow, coming onto the bridge from the left.

"Hi guys. Yes I am. Ever since the line to Deep 13 got cut off.." Mike
started.

"Thanks to Lover boy," Crow snorted.

"Oh you're just jealous," Tom retorted.

"I've been filling my system with caffeine so that I can call on it in an
instant," the temp finished.

"Great idea Mike," Crow said.

Suddenly the lights started to flash and the alarms sounded, ensuring the
usual panic.

"OOHHHH, WE'VE GOT FAN FIC SIGN," Crow and Tom shouted, racing into the
theater.

Mike cursed when he spilled some of the hot coffee on his hand.

(DOOR SEQUENCE) 7...6...5...4...3...2...1...

Mike, with his cup of coffee in one hand and Tom in the other, placed the
red robot in the third seat while he took the second. Crow quickly followed
up and sat in the first seat.

CROW: So what do we have today?
MIKE: Something good, I hope.
TOM: Ever the optimist eh Mike?

CROW: Hah! He even admits to being a fanboy!

>WARNING!!!  *insert atypical guidelines & who owns what stuff*
>Actually, this lemon has a dark side.  If you are against and/or
ALL: We are! We are!

>repulsed by true gothism, DO NOT READ THESE STORIES!!!  You will NOT
>LIKE THEM!!!  Also, if you're not over 18, shut off your computer & go
>get some exercise tonight... *grinz*
MIKE: If we could we would. <Slurps the rest of his coffee and places the
cup under his seat>
TOM: And besides, robots don't need exercise.
CROW: I don't think that it was *that* type of exercise he was referring to.

>You most likely need it.  Anyhow,
>let's get on with it...
MIKE: well I suppose I could... Hey! You don't see me insulting your form
blubber butt!

>Part One: The Release
CROW: Closely followed by Part 2, the Restriction.

>Ayeka smiled softly as she exited from the shower.
CROW: BOO!! I wanted Ryoko!
TOM: Fanboy!
CROW: Grrr...

>Her skin was as pale
>as possible, and for this she was grateful...
MIKE: Why? Is she going to act like a ghost?

>*Tonight's the night,* she
>thought as she entered her room & carefully closed it. All year she had
>been waiting for this concert. Imagine, Mercyful Fate AND Sisters of
>Mercy here in Japan! The prospects alone filled her with delight...
TOM: So Aeka is going out to a concert... This does not seem too bad so far.

MIKE: It could even be done by someone as good as Happosai.
CROW: The pervert from Ranma?
MIKE: No, the author of Aikan Muyo, a really good Tenchi lemon.
TOM: Ah-hah! So *that* was why you were up all night!
MIKE: <Blushing> No that isn't it.
CROW: <Sarcastic> Sure Mike. We believe you.

>As
>she reached under the bed, she gave one last glance around. *Good,* she
>thought. *They're all out screwing around or something... All the better
>for me to sneak out tonight...*
MIKE: As a good Tenchi fan, I would like to point out that Aeka does not
think like that.

>Lifting the box from under the bed, she gently placed it on top & slowly
>opened the lid.
CROW: And all the horrors and evils of mankind were released, leaving only
hope behind.
TOM: Wrong box, Crow.

>Inside this box was her deepest secret,
CROW: The bust cream she had borrowed from Ryoko!
MIKE: Crow...

>and she had to
>be careful so no one, not even her sister, found out... She began with
>the silk panties and bra. As their black softness enveloped her, she
>began to relax & have fun.
CROW: <begins to drool>
TOM: Looks like you're gonna have to get the mop later on Mike.
MIKE: Yuck!

>Next, she gingerly pulled on the black satin
>blouse; wincing with delicious pain as the soft fabric caressed her
>scarred arms.
MIKE: Huh? <rereads the last part of the sentence> Scarred arms? Oh man, I
will not accept Aeka as a self sadist!

>*And Ryoko wonders why I wear those robes all the time...*
TOM: <shocked> Wow! I didn't know clothes were for that! I thought they were
for something like to keep from being naked!

>she mused as she bared
CROW: <has stopped drooling> So she put herself in jail right?

>more of her true self to the world with each
>passing second.
MIKE: <Teacher's voice> And as time goes on, the snake sheds it's old skin
for a new one...

>Next, she opted for her long black skirt; so that with
>every step, she could tantalize the crowd with her long & lustrious
>legs...
TOM: First, had the author spelled that right, it would have been lustrous.
Second, why would she want to show off her legs? This is Aeka we're talking
about here! Not Ryoko!
MIKE: Smile and nod...

>Finally, she pulled on her soft socks. And to contrast, she
>slipped into a pair of Ankle-high boots.
CROW: Aha... Hmm...

>Reaching back into the box, she pulled out a velvet bag, from wich she
>procured a bottle of ebony nail polish & a stick of black lipstick.
MIKE: So she cured her purse of nail polish and lipstick...
TOM: Well they are pretty bad disease Mike.

>After another twenty minutes, her nails & lips were complete & she was
>ready to go. Opening her purse, she rertrieved her lancer and pen knife
>from the bottom of the box & sealed her purse again.
CROW: Courtesy of cheap mail order magazines!

>Then, with the
>stelthness of a cat,
ALL: <makes Buffalo stampede noise>

>she closed the box again & hid it as if it was
>never there.
MIKE: So she never pulled it out?

>On the way out of her room, she caught a glance of herself
>in the mirror and smiled. *This is the real me,* she began as she
>flashed a smile; revealing the razor-sharp fang teeth she had saved for
>almost a year for.
CROW: And now she's a vampire.
TOM: I didn't know you could save teeth.
MIKE: Cheaper then buying them.

>*I'll have to reccomend that dentist to my 'friends'
ALL: <hum the theme song of friends>

>tonight,* she mused as she turned out the light & left the room.
TOM: It took her five minutes to realize she had walked into a closet.

>All was quiet in the house
MIKE: <Singing> Nothing was stirring, not even a mouse...

>as she walked silently along the now darkened
>hallways. Looking at a nearby clock, she saw that she had more than
>enough time to get to the concert.
TOM: <Aeka> Ahhh!!! I'm late late!!!
CROW: <A-ko> Gotta go, bye!!!!

>"Ah," she whispered. "This is going
>to be some fun tonight..."
MIKE: <singing> Everybody have fun tonight...

>"OH REALLY?" came a almost mocking reply.
TOM: The voice would have mocked her but it just didn't feel like it that
night.

>Fear-stricken, she turned around and saw Ryoko standing in the doorway,
>blocking her exit. "Move it, bitch..." Ayeka began as she tried to shove
>her way past.
CROW: Hmm. Must be that time of the year.
MIKE: <Slaps Crow upside the head>
CROW: What was that for!
MIKE: For Samantha... and about every woman out there.

>"And what if I don't?" Ryoko began with a wicked glint in
>her eye.
TOM: <Aeka, whiny voice> I'll tell on you!

>"What is this thing you're so worried about that you'll sneak
>off without telling a soul? Hmmm?"
CROW:<Aeka> I can't let her find out about my breast enlargement surgery.
MIKE: One more comment... Just one more comment...

>Ayeka was about to start fighting with the space pirate when a thought
>occurred to her;
TOM: Sparks flew, smoke rose from the ears, etc...

>Ryoko wouldn't leave her alone untill she found out.
>So, why not show her, and whet her appitite for tonight at the same
>time?
MIKE: Something tells me that the appetite she's whetting isn't one for
food.

>"Why, Ryoko..." She began in a softer and more seductive tone.
CROW: Why ask why? Molson.
MIKE: That didn't sound good.
TOM: He's trying to score brownie points with the author.
JAMIE: And it's working!
ALL: Gyah!
CROW: Don't do that! Nearly gave me a heart attack.

>"Why do we allways have to fight? Can't we be friends?" And with this,
>she gently wrapped her arms around Ryoko's neck & swayed her hips softly
>in tune with an imaginary beat.
TOM: Oh no. Please don't let this go to where I think it's going to go...

>"Wha...?" Ryoko began, but Ayeka silenced her with a soft kiss on the
>lips. "Don't fight it, my love," Ayeka began in a low whisper. "You know
>you allways wanted to try it. Now, didn't you?"
ALL: ARGH!

>Ryoko nodded dumbly
MIKE: <dumb voice> Where are the rabbits George?

>as
>she stood there in shock.
CROW: Then maybe she should step off the exposed electrical wiring.

>Chuckling to herself, Ayeka pulled the stunned
>pirate into one of the ajoining rooms and silently closed the door.
TOM: Then rushed back out and locked Ryoko inside, right? Please?

>Licking her fangs in anticipation, Ayeka maneuvered Ryoko onto the bed &
>began to strip Ryoko of all her clothing.
CROW: This is not the lesbian scene I want to see!
MIKE: Who *would* you want to see?
CROW: Mihoshi and Kiyone!

>After undressing the now shy
>pirate,
TOM: Shy? SHY? God is this guy ever writing them out of character!

>she marveled at how quiet Ryoko had become. "Ah, my love, why
>are you so reluctant to voice your opinions?"
MIKE: I tried to in college but I kept getting beat up.

>Ayeka began as she slowly
>caressed Ryoko's thighs. ""I-I'm scared..." Ryoko began before Ayeka
>silenced her with another kiss.
CROW: Wouldn't it be better to have use duct tape?
MIKE: Thanks for reminding me! <Reaches under the seat and pulls out a roll
of duct tape. He then proceeds to tape Crow's mouth shut> Much better!
CROW: MMPPH!!!

>"It's all right..." Ayeka began as she
>softly caressed Ryoko's neither regions, and felt her dampoening
>allready.
TOM: Must be a hole in the roof and it's raining.

>"Ah..." Ayeka began as she slowly slipped between Ryoko's
>legs. "I see you're more into thios than I'd thought..." And with that,
>she began to slowly lap at Ryoko's golden nectar.
CROW: MMPPHH!!!!
MIKE: On boy. Here it comes guys! Close you eyes!
<Mike closes his eyes while the Tom look away. Crow stares, fixated, at the
screen. After a few minutes, they return their attention back to the screen>


>Laughing quietly, she checked herself in the mirror before
>continuing to the concert unopposed.
MIKE: I take it that was Aeka.
CROW: MMPPHH!!!!

>End of PART ONE
MIKE AND TOM: YAY!!!

>I warned you... This isn't your daddy's Hentai. Trust me, I plan on
>getting much more Gothic at the tale wears on... Anyhow, I also want to
>add that if you have any comments, you can reach me at
>sfe_otaku@hotmail.com. Well, untill next time, peace!
TOM: You think we can have peace after reading what you wrote?!
MIKE: I feel sick.
CROW: <peels the tape off his beak and pukes>
MIKE: You didn't look away.
TOM: I'll remind you to get some sawdust for that mess later.
MIKE: Thanks.
CROW: It was horrible Mike! Simply horrible! <breaks down and cries>
MIKE: Come on Crow Let's leave.
<Mike picks up Tom and leaves the theater, closely followed by a bawling
Crow>

(DOOR SEQUENCE) 1...2...3...4...5...6...7...

Tom watched, full of concern for his fellow bot as Mike poured the entire
contents of a bottle of Pepto Bismo down Crow's mouth.

"It was so horrible," he sputtered after the bottle had been drained. "I
mean.. there was blood and..." Crow proceeds to break down into tears again.

"I guess it would useless now to tell you that you should have looked away,"
Tom said.

"Was the sex scene really that bad," Mike asked.

Crow stared at him, eyes wide at the mention of the scene, and proceeds to
puke up yesterday's lunch of ram chips along with the Pepto Bismo.

"That bad."

"Well let's hope that the next fanfic will be *okay*, and I use that term
loosely, or else Crow here will be puking up ram chips from a week ago," Tom
said.

"You said it. But at least Dr. Forrester didn't see him lose it," Mike said.

DEEP 13

"Oh how I wish that the line hadn't been cut off," Dr. Forrester said,
starring at the useless hex screen. "I want to see if my test subjects are
tossing up last weeks lunch!"

"We will soon Clayton," TV's Frank said, coming up to stand beside him.

"Huh? How's that?"

"I sent the money to the phone company to pay for the bill," Frank replied.

"Excellent Frank! Good work! Uh... where did you get the money to pay for
the bill," Clayton asked.

"Oh I sold your original 1975 mint condition Corvette. It was just sitting
in the back, gathering dust and since you weren't using it..."

Dr. Forrester's lower lip trembled at this shocking development, his mind
deciding whatever to break down in tears or anger. It decided on the latter.

"Oh don't cry Clayton. I'm sure you'll be able to get your car back... Hmm.
I guess I had better push the button."

BLIP FWOOSSHHH!!!!!

"Come on Clayton! Don't cry like a baby," came Frank's fading voice.
________________________________________________________________________
The sex scene which was taken out was little more then one big paragraph,
but it made me ill nonetheless. I don't think I could do the rest of the
series when that Steve guy makes them. I like my sanity the way it is: a bit
shaky but firm. Until next time!
