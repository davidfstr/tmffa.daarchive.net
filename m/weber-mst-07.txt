As the USS Brian Drummond speeds through the darkness of the infinite void, 
Weber-san sighs. He's worked hard to make this ship run smoothly, and at the 
same time run a successful MST operation. But all the while, there have been 
newer and more disgusting lemons. And to make matters worse, his crew, none 
of which he owns, all of whom are the property of Funimation, Gainax, AIC, 
Pioneer, Sunrise, and ADV, and are used without permission (please don't 
sue. I'm not making money on this, and it's out of love of the characters), 
have encountered a darkfic lemon that they could not MST. He refuses to give 
up hope that one day, it might be accomplished, perhaps with the aid of 
another MST group, as was done to Kagato's Revenge. Perhaps docking at 
AnimePort # 9 would help...No, Peter Suzuki would never allow clearance to 
land there, Weber-san realizes, since we've MSTed many of his works 
ourselves.
To make matters even worse, Ryga of the Wind will no longer aid him, 
claiming he's tired of the burnt fur from all of his encounters with Prince 
Vegeta. Weber-san finds himself short a member. He knows of only one person 
who can aid him, and he turns to her now.

The new line up:

Zechs Merquise: The sane one.
Vegeta: The violent one.
Ryoko: The fiesty one.

and introducing:

Rei Ayanami: The silent type.

Weber-san: You guys know the drill. I want a clean MST of the following fic. 
And since Rei's new, we'll avoid the usual crap.
Vegeta: Oh, sure, take it easy on her. I see how this works.
Weber-san: Hentai mind out of the gutter, Saiya-jin. She's sacred to me. I'd 
never touch her.
Zechs: Considering her age, that's a good thing.
Weber-san: Him I can understand, but e tu, Zechs?
Zechs: Naturally.
Ryoko:(eyeing Rei): She reminds me of someone...
Rei: I am ready.
Weber-san: Then without further ado, I give you...

A Tenchi Muyo Fan Fiction.
Ruby Red, Cat-Like, Eyes.
By Peter Suzuki.

Vegeta: OH NO! Not a Suzuki fic again!
Ryoko: Ugh. That whole "Passion Satisfying, Ground Shaking, Glass 
Breaking..." thing.
Rei: I have heard that Mr. Suzuki is a fellow MSTer who hates Tank Cop with 
a passion.
Ryoko: Why does that matter to you?
Rei: I have been on the recieving end of Tank Cop's perversity.
Ryoko: No wonder you're so pensive.
Zechs: Can we get on with it, please?

        The series "Tenchi Muyo" is owned by Pioneer LDC, AIC, and their
contributors.  All rights reserved.

WARNING:  Some of you are going to hate me for this one.

Vegeta: Don't worry, Suzuki. If they didn't hate you for the Sasami thing, 
or your merciless MSTs, then nothing can make them hate you.
Rei: I will if Weber-san orders me to.
Weber-san: (light reflecting on glasses, gloved hands folded in front of 
him): That won't be necessary at this time.
Zechs: That's creepy, how you do that.
Ryoko: You ain't kiddin'.

  May contain some
language, and situations, not suitable for younger readers.

Zechs: That's why we found it in the Lemon Section, right.
Vegeta: If it's Sasami again...
Ryoko: I'll kill him if it is.
Rei: ...

#########

        It was a bright and sunny morning.  The fish were swimming in the 
lake,
the birds were chirping, small furry animals were running around the trees.

Vegeta: Look! It's a Suzuki story that doesn't take place at 4 in the 
morning!
Ryoko: My, how peaceful it seems.

"AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"

Rei: I believe that you spoke too soon, Ryoko-san.

        All of which were scared away, by the stone shattering screams of a 
young
woman in immense pain.

Zechs: Epyon is standing by for launch, should we need to squish a lemon 
writer.
Rei: Unit 00 will back you up.

"GET THIS F*&%$%G THING OUT OF ME!!!!!!!"

Vegeta: o_0
Ryoko: Oh, we are NOT off to a good start here.

        In the Masaki home, several people were by the closet door that led 
to
Washu's lab, where the sounds of pain, and anger were coming from.

Zechs:(as Washuu): Oh come now, anal probes don't hurt that much!
Vegeta: Zechs, no male should ever, under any circumstances, utter that 
line.

  Tenchi
covered Sasami's ears.

All except Rei: HALLELUJA! Sasami's not in the lemony parts!
Rei: She reminds me of someone...someone I know.

  Sasami covered Ryo-oh-ki's ears.  Mihoshi and
Kiyone stared at the door, terror expressed on their faces.  The three
rulers of Jurai sat on the couch.  Misaki was covering her mouth, Funaho
was covering her ears, and Azusa had his face buried in his hands.  Yosho
continued saying prayers to the spirits.  And Nobuyuki made sure that the
earplugs were secure in Mayuka's ears.

Zechs: Hey, aside from Washuu, who's missing?
Vegeta: It's either Ayeka or Ryoko.
Rei: They don't sound like Ryoko. The noise is too high pitched.
Ryoko: Those screams don't SOUND like Ayeka. They sound like Linda Blair!


        "GYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  
S#******************T!!!!"
The screams continued.

Zechs: Suzuki is censoring his own fic?
Vegeta: Why not? We all wish he'd censored that other one.
Ryoko: This is not normal. Something is very wrong here.

        And in the lab, Nurse Washu was working on her most important 
project yet.
        "Good." Said Washu, checking her watch.  "The contractions are about 
a
minute apart."
        Delivering a baby.

Rei: Ikari-kun told me that I reminded him of a mother. I was...embarrassed.
Ryoko: Do you ever alter your tone or speak in anything other than a 
whisper?
Vegeta: DON'T PUSH HER! You saw the End of Evangelion, didn't you?
Ryoko: No. Why?
Vegeta (whispers into Ryoko's ear)
Ryoko starts: NO WAY! HER?

        "NO S#*T!!!" screamed the mother-to-be.  "GET IT OUT OF ME, 
ALREADY!!!!"

Zechs: Didn't this play out in The Fly 2?

She tugged on the restraints that were on her arms and legs, set there to
keep her from hurting herself.
        Washu adjusted her goggles, and straightened her face mask.  "Would 
you
like for the 'Father' to be present for this?  After all, it is-"

Vegeta: Why is 'Father' in quotation marks?
Ryoko: I don't know, but I'm worried.
Rei: Worried why?
Zechs: This is suspicious.

        "OF COURSE I WANT THAT A$$^^%^@# TO BE HERE, SO I CAN [ Due to the 
graphic
content of the following obscenities, and death threats said by the

Vegeta makes a bag of popcorn.

Oh,
the heck with it.  I'll just skip to the end of it.  Peter Suzuki.]"

Vegeta: What? You mean, it goes on?
Ryoko: Almost as foul mouthed as you, huh, Vegeta?
Rei: Or Asuka.

        "My, such language." Washu muttered, as she began to walk to the 
door.
"I'll be back in a moment, so try not to hurt yourself.  Okay, Ayeka?"

Ryoko: If Tenchi got her pregnant, I'll kill him.
Vegeta: Oh grow up.
Ryoko:(brandishes sword) : Gonna make me?
Vegeta: For all you know, it was Yosho, anyway. Besides, what if it was 
Tenchi? So what. Find another man.
Rei: Love is more sacred than that.
Ryoko(in shock) : Did you say "love"?
Rei: Yes. For I know what love is. And I wish to unite with Ikari-kun.
Zechs: Um, aren't you both just a little young for that?
Vegeta: Oh, like Dorothy Catalonia wasn't a bit underage?
Zechs: I'll have you know that absolutely nothing happened between me and 
her.
Ryoko(as Clinton): I did not have sexual relations with the cousin of my 
enemy...
Zechs: You're both rotten to the core.
Rei: No, it is merely the absence of each other that causes them to be this 
way. That is what Gendou-san wishes to fix.
Other: @_@;

        The first princess of Jurai let out another scream of pain, that 
sent all
of the creatures in Washu's lab running away in fear.

Vegeta: A task made even more amazing by the fact that they're all in 
specimen jars!

        Washu poked her head out the door, and pulled down her face mask.
"Tenchi?"

Ryoko: (draws sword again): He's DEAD!

        "Yes, Miss Washu?" replied Tenchi.
        "Where is she?" Washu asked.
        "In my room pacing back and forth, the last time I saw her." said 
Tenchi.
        "Go get her.  It's almost time." Said Washu, as she turned back 
toward her
lab.

Ryoko: Wait, go get "her"? I thought Washuu wanted the father.

        Tenchi looked uncertain.  "Are you sure that's wise, Washu?  The 
last time
Ayeka saw her, she. . ." Tenchi did not want to verbally repeat what Ayeka
had said, or did.

Vegeta: We've said it before, and we'll say it again. Tenchi, grow a pair.

        "Don't worry.  Everything will be-"
        Washu was cut off as Ayeka's scream erupted from the lab.
"AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!
FU@$$#%^&&**^^%$#@$$^&**&^%@@#$%^&*&^%$#@#%^&***^%###%%$%^^&&%%##@@$#$%^&^$$
^%%%&&*((**&$$!@#$%%$%#$^^$$^&&**((&*&%$#&^$##%^&*#&%&#%%#*(&&^*^^%$&%&^$%^%
#&%*(*(%^%%#  WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!!!!!!!"

Zechs: I didn't even know she knew words like that!!!
Rei: I take back my earlier assessment. Not even Asuka is that unruly.

        "Just trust me, okay!" Washu blurted out, almost too quickly.  
"Don't
worry, Ayeka!!  I'll help, don't worry!!" Said Washu, as she went back into
her lab.  Everybody mentally noted that Washu had to be one of the bravest
people they had ever known.

Vegeta: Nah. She's just had kids of her own.
Ryoko: This coming from a "model" parent.
Vegeta: Hey! How I beat...er...raise my kids is no consequence of yours!
Rei: I have no mother.
Others: Awwwwwww.

        "I'll go get her." Tenchi mumbled, as he went back to his room to 
fetch
the 'Father'-to-be.

Ryoko: Wait, the "father to be" is a she? This has to be Washuu's doing!
Zechs: Didn't you claim everyone was quick to blame your mother in that 
Sasami thing we MSTed?
Ryoko: This one is a scientific impossiblity! Only Washuu can do that!
Vegeta: (evil grin on face): I just remembered who else was absent from the 
room!

        Said parent was now sitting on the floor of Tenchi's room, nervously
eating M&M's.  The pile of multicolored, candy shells beside her proved
this.

Rei: What does the milk candy that melts in your mouth and not in your hands 
have to do with planned parenting?
Vegeta(evil grin broadening): Oh, I don't think this was planned!

        Tenchi quietly opened the door, and spoke to the nervous woman 
inside.
"Ryoko.  Washu says that she wants you back in the lab now."

Zechs and Ryoko facefault.
Vegeta: MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Rei (turns shade of green): That was unexpected.

        Ryoko looked up from the floor.  Her face was abnormally pale.  
"A-are you
sure it's all right?" said Ryoko, sounding uncharacteristically timid.

Ryoko: TIMID! LET ME AT SUZUKI, AND I'LL SHOW HIM HOW TIMID I CAN BE!!!!!!!
Vegeta: Oh, you new parents are always so nervous. You'll get used to it.
Ryoko: I WILL kill you, Vegeta. You know that, don't you?! I will KILL you.

"After what happened last time I. . ."
        "It's okay now." Said Tenchi.  "Her head stopped spinning an hour 
ago, and
she hasn't breathed fire for a while."

All: -_-"

Although he mentally noted that he
did not know if Ayeka's eyes were still glowing, or not.

Rei: I think she has very nice eyes. They are quite beautiful, in a way.

        Ryoko stood up, and took in a deep breath.  "Okay." she said, 
mustering up
all of her courage. "Let's go."

        Ryoko and Tenchi entered the lab.  The cyan-hared

Vegeta: OK, the mysterious cyan-hare makes its appearance.
Zechs: I think by now we all know it's a spelling error.
Rei: The appropriate spelling being "haired".

woman carefully
approached the bed, where Ayeka lay.  The princess was NOT happy to see
her.

Zechs: When is she ever?
Vegeta: Well, about nine months ago...
Ryoko: DIE SAIYA-JIN SCUM!!!! (Ryoko throws several bolts at Vegeta)
The smoke clears to reveal Vegeta perfectly fine, a barrier of ki between 
him and Ryoko. Rei sits in her seat, unfazed, and Zechs has taken up a 
defensive stance behind the counch.

        "It is about time that you showed up!!!" Ayeka yelled at Ryoko, 
before
letting out another scream of pain.  "AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!  THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, RYOKO!!!!!!!"

Vegeta rolls in the aisles, laughing his ass off.

        Ryoko winced, from the force of Ayeka's scream.  "N-now Ayeka, I'm 
here to
help you if you need me for anything." Ryoko managed to say.

Ryoko: I said it in the Sasami MST, and I'm saying it here! I DO NOT SWING 
THAT WAY!
Vegeta: Come off it. We all saw the scene in Tenchi Universe where Sasami 
shot you two with the Lesbian Arrows of Love.
Ryoko: THAT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS CALLED, DAMN IT!
Vegeta: Surrrrrrre.
Weber-san: You have to admit, Ryoko, it looked pretty...um...affectionate.
Ryoko: I...willl....kill....you....all.
Vegeta: Popcorn, Rei?
Rei: (blushes): Thank you.
Ryoko (as Cartman): Kill you guys...Kill you guys...

        "You want to help me?  Fine!  Bring your neck over here so I can 
break
something!!!" Ayeka remarked, in a too sweet tone.

Vegeta: I've been around Bulma long enough to know THAT tone. That tone 
means trouble.

  "This is all your fault
that this happened to me, Miss 'Able to change her gender'!!!

Zechs: Ryoko?
Ryoko: Uh....Not that I know of...
Rei: Kaurou and I are one in the same. Gender is meaningless.
Vegeta: That's probably what Tank Cop thought when he wrote that one yuri 
fic....
Zechs: Ugh.
Rei: Hmmmmm. You have a point.

AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!  I HATE YOU, RYOKO!!!!!  I CAN'T BELEVE I DIDN'T TRY
TO KILL YOU WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!"

Vegeta: We always hurt the ones we love.
Ryoko: I hate you.
Vegeta: ^_^, I know.

        "You hate her?  That's not what you were screaming to her, nine 
months
ago."

Vegeta: Heeheeheeheehee!
Zechs: Oh, now somebody's gonna get it for that one.


All other heads turned toward the one who said that.
        "Um. . .  I think I'll go out, and see how everyone else is doing." 
Said
Tenchi, as he tried to avoid the confused stare of Washu, the shocked stare
of Ryoko, and the death promising stare coming from Ayeka.

Zechs: You mean, he watched?
Vegeta: Wouldn't you?
Zechs: You know, Noin's been spending alot of time with that Sally Po chick 
now that she thinks I'm dead...
Vegeta: And then there's all those fics about your "friendship" with Treize.
Zechs: Oh. And howabout the ones with you and Goku.
Vegeta: I think we'd best leave those alone.
Zechs: That's what I thought.

        After Tenchi left the lab, Ayeka and Ryoko returned to their. .
conversation.  "I can't believe that you did this to me, Ryoko!!!"

Rei: I think Ryoko is just as dumfounded.

        "Now, Ayeka." Scolded Washu.  "Ryoko didn't know that she would get 
you
pregnant.  Even I didn't realize she could alter her gender to that level."

Zechs: So, like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, there must have been frog 
DNA in Ryoko. So when she spent too long in an environment that was mostly 
female, she became male!
Ryoko: Zechs, I can kill you, you know. And it'll hurt when I do it.

        "That is beside the point!!!" Ayeka screamed back.  "She took 
advantage of
me, while I was drunk!!!"

Vegeta: Knowing her, you were BOTH soused at the time.

        Ryoko wanted to comment that they were both stone drunk,

Vegeta: Told ya.

and that Ayeka
did not resist the entire ordeal at all, but seeing as how Ayeka was
ripping the double reinforced, titanium restraints from the ground, she
decided not to voice it.

Vegeta: Oh wuss. Wuss!
Ryoko: (puts her sword to Vegeta's throat): Were you saying something?

        Then Ayeka began to scream in pain, again.  
"GYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!  IT
HURTS!!!!  IT HURTS!!!!"
        "She's going into final contractions!!" Washu yelled over the noise. 
  "The
baby's coming out!!"
        Washu went to work, and Ryoko rushed over to Ayeka's bedside.  Ayeka
obliged Ryoko's concern by taking Ryoko's hand into her own, and crushing
it with the force of a full garbage truck running over an ant.

Vegeta: That's about half the force I used on those cretins guarding 
Frieza's ship. It's a satisfying feeling, I can tell you.

  The sound
of bones breaking were muffled by Ayeka's screaming.
        "I can see the baby's head!!" said Washu.  "How are things up there,
Ryoko!?!"
        ". . ." Ryoko was in too much pain to comment, as Ayeka folded her 
hand
over, and crushed it again.
        "Ryoko, is everything all right!?!" asked Washu.
        "Oh, yeAh.  EvEryThINg FinE!!" Was Ryoko's rather strangled, mental 
reply.
"HurRy uP WiTh deLIvEry, plEaSe!!"

        Outside the laboratory, everybody else listened closely to the door,
waiting for any sign that it was safe to go in.  Unfortunately, the only
sounds that they could hear were Ayeka's screaming, and the occasional
comment from Washu.  Then, after a tense minute of silence, a new sound
came from the lab.

"WHAAAAA!!!  WHAAAAA!!!"

Vegeta: Oh come now, Ryoko. It can't hurt THAT badly.

        "Hey!" exclaimed Sasami.  "That's not Ayeka's voice!"

        "Congratulations." Washu could be heard from behind the door.  "It's 
a
girl."

Rei: I will name her George, and I will love her and pat her and hold her 
and squeeze her...
Vegeta: Um, Rei. Please don't do that. You're scaring us.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

And so.

        After the cutting of the umbilical cord, which Ryoko had to use a 
pair of
LEFT handed scissors for, the parents and their child quietly contemplated
what had just happened.

Zechs: They always wait until it's over to contemplate. If they thought 
about it before hand, there wouldn't be any problems like this.

        "So, um. . . How are you feeling, Ayeka?" asked Ryoko, trying not to 
use
her bandaged hand too much.
        "Tired.  Very, tired." Replied Ayeka, gently cradling her newborn 
daughter
in her arms.
        "You know. . ." Ryoko tried to find the right words to say.  "I 
never
expected my first child to be born like this."

Vegeta: Gee, ya think?

        "Nor did I." Said Ayeka.  "But, all things considered, I guess it 
turned
out well."  Ayeka smirked.  "It could have been that idiot, Seriyou for all
it was worth."

Ryoko: It should have been!

        Ryoko thought about that for a moment.  "I don't think I could get 
him
pregnant, even if I tried."

Vegeta: On the contrary, I have proof that Seriyou is actually the adult 
form of Chibi-Usa!
Zechs: When the Sailor Moon fans flame you, I want to watch.

        Both of them laughed as loudly as they dared, trying not to wake 
their
daughter.
        Ayeka decided to bring up a serious topic.  "So, what is going to 
happen
now?"

Ryoko: I am not hearing this. LALALALALALALALALALALALALA.....

        "You mean, besides the fact that we're both going to have to marry 
Tenchi,
now?" They both managed to only snicker.  "I guess we may as well try to
raise her as a family. . .although considering who's in our family, I think
we're going to have our hands full."

Vegeta: Oh come off it. You've already got one heck of a babysitter if you 
two decide to work on a second kid.
Ryoko mallets Vegeta.

        "I agree." Said Ayeka.  "Your mother. . ." Ayeka waited for any 
denials of
relation to Washu.  There were none.  "Seemed to take it quite well." The
princess scowled.  "Then again, considering what she has done before, I
don't think she finds THIS as being too unusual."  Ayeka then became more
concerned.  "But my father may be another matter entirely.  He was angry
enough when he thought that it was Lord-Tenchi who impregnated me. . ."

Zechs(as Azuza): I expect you to do the right thing by my daughter.
Vegeta(as Tenchi): Yessir. I'll marry her right away!
Zechs(as Azuza): I meant kill yourself, earthling worm!


        Ryoko nodded in agreement with that.  "He still hasn't said anything 
about
it being US, yet." Ryoko grimaced.  "But the way he's been glaring at me, I
think he doesn't like it."

Vegeta: Oh that's just the father in him. No Dad approves of the person who 
impregnates his daughter. And Ryoko does have that immense criminal 
record...

  Ryoko then looked deeply into Ayeka's eyes.
"But what he thinks will not change how I feel about this."
        "And. . .how do you feel, about this?" Ayeka asked.
        Ryoko smiled.  "I don't mind one bit.  I think that as far as 
mothers go,
our daughter is lucky to have you."

Rei(baby as Cartman): But I wanna know who my father is...

        Ayeka smiled, and blushed slightly.  Her expression then turned a 
little
sad.  "Ryoko. . .about what I said to you earlier. . .while I was in labor.
."
        Ryoko put her index finger up to Ayeka's lips.  "I know you didn't 
mean
what you said.  I understand that it was the pain talking." She then held
up her cast.  "But it wasn't necessary to SHARE that pain with me, Ayeka."

Vegeta: Phhh! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Delivery room humor. How I hate it.

        Ayeka tried her best not to laugh, but her chuckling woke up the 
sleeping
girl in her arms.  The newborn looked up into the faces of her parents,
with wonder and innocence showing brightly in her eyes.  The shape
inherited from Ryoko's cat like eyes, and the color from Ayeka's ruby
colored eyes.  She did the only thing she could really think of doing.
        Both parents were slightly surprised when their daughter started 
laughing
along with them, in a laugh that sounded startlingly like Ayeka's usual
cackle.  But they both smiled, and enjoyed the time with their daughter.

Zechs: I wonder what color her hair will be?
Vegeta: Look next to you, Zechs. Your sitting beside her.
Rei: ....
Vegeta: Seriously! Look, long, eliptical eyes, ruby red color, blue hair, 
similar to Sasami...Rei Ayanami is the love child of Ryoko and Ayeka!
Rei (hugs Ryoko): MOTHER! I've found you at last!
Ryoko: (looks at contented Rei, then at Vegeta): You will pay for this, 
Vegeta! God in Heaven as my witness, you WILL pay!

        Ayeka and her daughter fell asleep together on the bed, and Ryoko 
watched
protectively over them.  Ready for the challenges that tomorrow would
bring.  And for one brief moment, all was right with the world.

Zechs: Sounds like the end of Gundam Wing, until Endless Waltz comes along.

THE END, FOR NOW.

AUTHOR'S NOTES:

        No flames, please.  I tried to get a tender, heartfelt scene in the 
end,
so it wasn't all bad.

Vegeta: A Suzuki fic I actually liked.
Ryoko: YOU would. REI! I am NOT your mother!
Rei: Oh, that's right. DADDY!
Ryoko: =>_<=, Rei, I am going to count to three, and if you don't unhand me, 
you will find it very unpleasant.

        Okay, now for the crazy rant. . .

        BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!  I DID IT AGAIN!!!  It's been thought of,
suggested, mentioned, and threatened, BUT only from the writer who gave you
such twisted stories as "A Secret Confession." And "A Passion Satisfying,
Ground Shaking, Glass Breaking. . ." are you given a Fan Fic where Ryoko
and Ayeka actually have a child!!!

Vegeta: So we have you to blame for Evangelion, huh?
Zechs: I thought you liked Eva?
Vegeta: I do, sort of. But the end was too trippy for me.
Weber-san: Well, I WAS going to show you Serial Experiments Lain, but I'll 
pass now.
Ryoko: 1

        What's next for me!?!  I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!  Maybe I'll write a story 
where
Nagi falls in love with Tenchi!  Maybe I'll write a Fic where Kagato is the
HERO!!

Weber-san: I have to remember that idea, and then blame Suzuki for it when I 
write it.
Ryoko: 2.

Heck, I'll have Sasami fall in love with him just for fun!  How
about an alternate universe of the first TV series, where Ryoko gets
amnesia from her crash, and becomes this overly sweet, very lovable
girl!?!?!

Ryoko: (stops count) : WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT! I'M LOVEABLE.
Rei: *I* love you, Dad.
Ryoko: (sighs): Weber-san, explain it to her, please?
Weber-san: I dunno. Vegeta makes a convincing arguement.

  Or another alternate universe of the OAV series and the comics,
where Ryoko and Minagi are sisters from the start, and Yakage and Washu are
married!?!?  Maybe I'll just continue THIS story from where it left off, or
someone else will!!!!

        If you want to do ANY of these ideas, or if YOU want to do them 
yourself,
please tell me!!

        Oh, and by the way.  I was thinking that a good name for Ayeka & 
Ryoko's
daughter would be "Koyasha"( the name literally means "Demon Child")

Vegeta: We think Rei Ayanami is preferable.

        Tell me what you think.  Your constructive comments are always
appreciated.

Peter Suzuki.

Ryoko: I will kill him
Weber-san: Oh come off it. You roasted Vegeta alive for that Saiya-jin one. 
I thought you deserved a turn.
Ryoko: But now this...this girl is clinging to me!
Rei: Actually, Weber-san paid me to do that. Gendou-san is all I know. 
Ikari-kun is the one I love.
Ryoko: I'll kill the lot of you.
Rei: Besides, I do have a passing resemblance to Sasami. I think it's why 
Tank Cop took an unhealthy obsession with the poor girl.
Ryoko: Like his obsession with YOU is healthy.
Weber-san: I think an obsession with Rei is VERY healthy. Writing Yuri 
Rei/Asuka stories is NOT.

Zechs: Anyway, to Mr. Suzuki, we could find no fault with this fic, save for 
Ryoko, who is a bit biased. But then, we wonder how Ayeka at AnimePort # 9 
is taking it.
