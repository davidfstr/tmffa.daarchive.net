Here is is!

She once was a goddess
Pretty and strong
But she yearned for a love
That would be true and long

She came to our dimension
In hopes of that love
She sacrificed her powers
Leaving her sister in the dimension above

She met a young man
At the Academy of Science
They fell in love
And formed an alliance

Soon she had a baby
Her newest dream complete
She was fascinated with the newborn
>From the grasping hands to the tiny feet

But as soon as it happened
It all vanished one day
Because of her low class
Her family was taken away

Oh how she cried
Sinking to her knees
But it was all ignored,
Her cries and her pleas

She began to work and invent
To fill the empty space in her heart
She decided neither to love nor trust
For fear of having to part

Eventually she regained her faith
To love again, she would try
This was her last attempt
No wanting to be hurt or to cry

She created a girl
A daughter to trust
But they too were seperated
By an evil man's blood lust

Trapped, imprisoned
In a powerful sleep
She couldn't break free
For it was too deep

Millenia later
By some stroke of luck
Two girls were fighting
Her crystal cage was struck!

It started creaking and cracking
But when the noise ceased
There was fresh air and light
She was released!

Reunited with her daughter
To reconcile the years
She was now also free
Of the hurt and the tears

Now spending her days at a holo computer
With inventions old and new
Our red-haired genius is happy again
Mother and Goddess, our Little Washu
