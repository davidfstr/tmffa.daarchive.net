MISSION LOG #5: "TALES OF ADAM #2: ADAM'S RETURN"
NERV TOP SECRET
YOU 

BALTHAZAR:	NERV-MST Episode 3, reeeeeeeel one!

OPENING THEME v.0.1 (To the MST3K theme song)

In the not-distant-enough future,
Post Third-Impact A.D.,
The Event Horizon ripped a hole
Across causality.

A secret group by the name of NERV
Tried to find what purpose the hole could serve...
Well, the Fourth Impact left them alive,
So they had to seal the hole up before Impact number Five!

(OH...NOT AGAIN!!!)

RITSUKO:	<singing>
I'll test a group with fanfics!
The oddest I can find! (la la la)
They'll watch them while I monitor
Their sync ratios and minds! (la la la)

Now keep in mind the mission fails
If the world happens to end,
But the crew just doesn't know why NERV
Has to rearrange their friends...

Current Roll Call!
Shinji! ("I mustn't run away...")
Lina!	("DRAGON SLAVE!!!")
Newjersey!	("It belongs in a museum!")
Aeka!	(First Princess!)
Harry!	(The Boy Who Lived!)
RYOOOOOOOOOOOOOKO!	(Space pirate!)

If you're wondering how they eat and breathe,
Well Ritsuko knows the facts.
But if you're looking for NERV's MST,
Then have a seat and just relax!

For NERV's latest conspiracy...Causality!

	All is not well in the halls of NERV, for the halls are alive...with the
sound of gunfire.  The scene is vaguely resemblant of the End of Evangelion,
except the invading forces are not the UN troops, but rather particularly
fanatical AHRLI's.  The AHRLI's have penetrated well into NERV, and some of the
fight has ended up in the control room of Central Dogma.  Gendo Ikari, the
Supreme Commander of NERV, is still at his command desk, hands in front of his
face in the usual pensive gesture.  He is presently wearing kevlar body armor,
as is Fuyutski, who is standing in his usual position just behind and to one
side of Gendo.

GENDO:	Fuyutski.

FUYUTSKI:	Yes?

GENDO:	Do you ever have the feeling of Deja Vu?

	Two stray bullets narrowly miss Gendo, putting holes in the NERV logo just
behind the command desk.  Gendo calmly takes one hand away from his face (the
part where his glove was before is inflammed from the forced removal of his
hands), reaches under the desk and withdraws a handgun, which he uses to fire
three shots into the combat zone.
	Suddenly Ryoko descends through the celing in her red combat garb, light
sword in hand.  On her face is an expression of rage.

AHRLI #1:	Hooray!  It's Ryoko!  She will punish these NERV infidels!

RYOKO:	<eye twitch> Infidels?

AHRLI #2:	Ryoko shall vanquish Aeka and...

RYOKO:	<smirking and extinguishing the lightsword> I appreciate having a fan
base, guys, but my relationship with Tenchi and my competition with Aeka...
<starts firing off energy-blasts at the AHRLI'S> ARE NONE OF YOUR DAMN
BUSINESS!!!

FUYUTSKI:	In retrospect it was smart to get OAV Ryoko.

	On the surface, Eva-01 (piloted by Shinji Ikari) and Eva-02 (piloted by
Asuka Langley Sorhyu) are squaring off with heavy artillery and airborne VTOL
units.

ASUKA:	So Shinji...

SHINJI:	What?

ASUKA:	I'll bet I can hit that tank over those hills there.

SHINJI:	Well, okay...

ASUKA:	Oh come on, Shinji, where's your sense of competition?

SHINJI:	I just don't think it's a good idea to get cocky now.

ASUKA:	Cocky?  I'm not cocky, I'm just the best Eva pilot here!

SHINJI:	If you say so...

ASUKA:	<turning Eva-02's head to look at Eva-01> What's that supposed to mean,
Third Child?

SHINJI:	Asuka, the last time I got cocky and competitive I ended up getting
sucked through an Angel into the sea of Dirac.

ASUKA:	<smirk> Hmmph.  Well you're just too stupid not to know your limits,
Ikari.

SHINJI:	Sorry.

ASUKA:	What IS it with you and that conditioned response?  You always just say
"sorry" when you're confronted!

SHINJI:	Sorry!

	Meanwhile...
	
AHRLI #3:	<in tank> I don't understand it, why don't they attack?

AHRLI #4:	<in VTOL> You tell me.

	Down in NERV headquarters, the firefight continues.  The fight has
progressed to the wide-open space of crisscrossing conveyors and bridges
connecting several portions of NERV.  An improvised barricade of chewing gum,
construction paper, and MRE's protects a small group from the onslaught of
AHRLI infantry penetrating the hallways.  Misato Katsuragi has her back to the
barrier, and she's in full body armor.  Harry Potter, in olive drab robes,
wearing a vintage World War II helmet, is peeking over the top of the
barricade.  Aeka Jurai, in her battle gear, is also behind the barricade.

AEKA:	Oh this is just so stupid!  I should have been going back to Jurai!  I
was only supposed to be here for one fic!

MISATO:	<jamming another clip into her rifle> Princess, with all due respect,
shut up and shoot!

	Misato turns over and fires prone at the oncoming troops, the full-auto
spray emptying the M-16 clip in three seconds.  She ducks back to slam another
clip home.

HARRY:	REDUCTO!  Uh...PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!  REDUCTO!  STUPEFY!  IMPEDIMENTA!

MISATO:	What the hell is that?

HARRY:	Those are spells...there are just so many of them and I don't have
anything that'll sweep an entire hallway.

MISATO:	<setting her rifle to 'burst'> Whatever works...

	Misato aims over the barricade and fires.
	
AEKA:	Azaka!  Kamidake!

	The guardians of Jurai appear on either side of Aeka, topped with Vintage
World War I combat helmets.

GUARDIANS:	Yes, Ma'am?

AEKA:	I command you to put those scoundrels to death!

GUARDIANS:	Yes Ma'am!

	Azaka and Kamidake float over the barricade and open fire upon the AHRLI's. 
Several screams are heard, and the cacophony of laser fire and automatic
weapons fire increases.  Within a minute, however, splinters start flying over
the barricade, and a very bullet-riddled kamidake falls over the barricade,
making Harry scramble out of the way.

KAMIDAKE:	Medic...

HARRY:	Uh oh...they're advancing...and bringing in more troops!

MISATO:	Oh great...they know you're here, Aeka.  I don't think they're going to
stop.  Crap!  I'm empty!  I need another clip!

HARRY:	ACCIO CLIP!

	A spare magazine tears itself from one of the dead AHRLI's pockets and
sails over the barrier.

HARRY:	ACCIO CLIP!  ACCIO CLIP!  ACCIO CLIP!

AEKA:	I can't stand this!  I have to do something!

MISATO:	Aeka, wait...

	Aeka stands up, calling on her Juraian powers to shield herself.  Quickly,
she starts unloading force bolts on the advancing AHRLI's.  Upon seeing Aeka,
they surge forward with fanatical determination, hoping to overwhelm her shield
and facilitate her demise.

NEWJERSEY:	<On Radio> Lupus to Foxhole, Lupus to Foxhole.

	Misato scrambles to pick up the radio.
	
MISATO:	Newjersey?  Where the hell are you?

NEWJERSEY:	<OR> I had to raid the armory and stop by the bathroom.  I'm
bringing some heavy armament but I need a clear space to come in!

MISATO:	I'd love to oblige but we've got a problem.  The AHRLI's know we've got
Aeka here, so they're going to start dumping troops on us!

HARRY:	Wait, I've got an idea!

	Harry aims his wand carefully at one of the AHRLI's ammunition bags.
	
HARRY:	ACCIO PIN!

	In a moment Harry shows the pin in his palm to Misato.  Misato suddenly
gets a horrified look on her face, grabs Aeka by the side of her battle outfit,
and pulls her down behind the barricade.  A second later, the grenade which
previously had that pin goes off, cooks off the other grenades in the ammo
satchel, and annihilates a couple battalions of AHRLI's when the explosion
chain-fires their ammunition.
	Ouch.
	Suddenly the Indiana Jones theme music blares over the NERV public address
system, and Newjersey, in werewolf form, swings in on his whip.  Nobody can see
the fine leather jacket or the pistol belt due to the fact that he has
bandoliers of ammunition, ammo boxes, a minigun, a pair of fifty-caliber
machine guns, and a Mk.13 30mm automatic grenade launcher slung all over his
furry body.  He lands heavily on the blasted bridgeway, coils his whip, and
starts dancing in place...

NEWJERSEY:	Ow!  Hot floor!  Ow!

MISATO:	<eyeing a clear path> Quick!  Fall back to the cafeteria!

AEKA:	Why the cafeteria?

MISATO:	Trust me, while we have the time to move, let's move there!

	Back in the entry plugs...
	
SHINJI:	Let's just get rid of these guys and go home!  A full-spread AT field
ought to do it.

ASUKA:	And suddenly you're a combat expert, Shinji?

SHINJI:	Asuka, come on, we're wasting time!

ASUKA:	You're the one who's wasting time, Third Child, you're always slowing
me down!

SHINJI:	Sorry.

ASUKA:	And don't apologize!

SHINJI:	Asuka, we're not getting anything done arguing.

ASUKA:	And who's fault is that?!

SHINJI:	Sor...

ASUKA:	Shinji, you idiot!

SHINJI:	Asuka, the AHRLI units are still here...

ASUKA:	Well if you weren't slowing me do...

SHINJI:	Asuka, Eva-01 is running on an S2 engine!  You're limited by that power
umbilical!  If anything, you'll slow me down!

ASUKA:	Oh you think so, Third Child?  I'm amazed an idiot like you can even
synchronize!

SHINJI:	Asuka, stop acting like a bitch and let's just get this job done!

	Eva-02 rounds on Eva-01, and every AHRLI on the surface of Tokyo-3
sweatdrops.

ASUKA:	What did you say?!

AHRLI #3:	Oh to hell with it, OPEN FIRE!
	
SHINJI:	You heard what I said, stop acting like a bitch!

	A hail of gunfire and artillery starts pelting the two Evangelions.
	
ASUKA:	Now look what you've done, they're shooting at us!

SHINJI:	That's IT!  I've put up with you for two Impacts already...dammit, out
of my face!  <Backhands a VTOL, sending it spinning to its fiery death in a
line of tanks>

ASUKA:	Oh bring it on, Shinji!

	Eva-01 charges Eva-02, and Asuka rolls with the force, throwing Eva-01 to
land on a group of tanks.

SHINJI:	Oh yeah?!

	Eva-01 picks up a tank and throws it at Eva-02, who blocks the flying
armored vehicle and sends it crashing onto two more tanks.  Shinji, seeing an
opening, lunges at Eva-02, punching it in the gut region.  Asuka knees Eva-01
in the groin, Eva-01 headbutts Eva-02, skewering a VTOL on its cranial mast. 
Eva-02 stumbles back, then tears open a supply bunker and brings a pallete
rifle to bear.  Asuka, grinning maliciously, opens fire on Eva-01, who deftly
dodges the automatic fire as it rips through VTOL's and tanks and dramatically
reduces real estate values.  Soon the rifle clicks empty.

ASUKA:	Aw SHIST!

	Eva-02 swings the rifle like a bat, catching a VTOL in midair and sending
it at Eva-01.

ASUKA:	Home run!

SHINJI:	...

	Eva-01 kicks a tank like a football at Eva-02's head, but Eva-02 ducks at
the last minute.  The tank goes sailing into the sky with the requisite anime
sparkle.

ASUKA:	Missed!  <Sticks out her tongue, then her eyes go really wide as she
has to make Eva-02 duck and roll to dodge a positron blast> What the...

	Eva-01 has the positron cannon, relic of the showdown in Tokyo-3, and is
wielding it like a rifle.  Shinji tries to make the sights line up...

SHINJI:	Target in the center, pull the sw...target in the center, pull the
swi...DAMMIT!  Stupid positrons, why the hell do they have to be affected by
magnetic and electrical fields!  Oh to hell with it!

	Eva-01 pulls the trigger on the positron cannon and reloads the fuse, again
and again, while he tries to center Eva-02 in the recticle.  Unfortunately the
gun siezes when the barrel overheats, and he tosses the gun aside.  The now
melting barrel lands on a line of tanks, heats up their internal magazines, and
cooks off the ammunition.

	Back in Central Dogma, the firefight continues.  AHRLI's have regrouped and
are now pouring into the cafeteria, where the lunch tables now serve as
barricades.  Misato and Harry operate the fifty-caliber machine guns, throwing
the Geneva Convention to the wind (of course Geneva was kinda totaled in Third
Impact).  Newjersey is standing on a table in human form, mowing down oncoming
lines of troops with the minigun, when just as his magazine empties, he jerks
convulsively from several bullet impacts, and falls backwards.

AEKA:	NEWJERSEY!

NEWJERSEY:	Ow...

AEKA:	Oh no...you've been...

NEWJERSEY:	Shot.  Yeah.  Give me a few seconds.

	Aeka sweatdrops.
	
NEWJERSEY:	What do you expect?  I AM a werewolf.  Excuse me.

	Newjersey picks up the Mk.13 and sets it on the table, firing grenades all
across the cafeteria.

AEKA:	Misato, you said we'd have an advantage here?  Aside from not starving
to death, I don't see what the advantage is!

	Newjersey spasms again as he takes more bullet impacts, then collapses.
	
HARRY:	I thought werewolves were stronger than that!

NEWJERSEY:	Harry, these bullets might not kill me, but they still HURT!

MISATO:	Yeah, we do...HEY LINA!

	Lina Inverse pops up behind the serving counter.
	
LINA:	What?  SHIT!

	Lina ducks as gunfire swings in her direction, pelting the pots and pans
with profuse projectiles.

LINA:	I can't eat with all this gunfire!  Someone tell those guys to knock it
off!  <stands up briefly> MEGA BRANDO!

	A large explosion blows a hole in the line of AHRLI's.
	
MISATO:	Lina, can't you unload something larger on them?

LINA:	How MUCH larger?!

MISATO:	I don't know!  Waste them all!

LINA:	<getting an evil grin> Are you sure?

MISATO:	JUST DO IT!

LINA:	Darkness beyond twilight, crimson beyond blood that flows, in thy
majestic name buried in the flow of time.

	Newjersey, recognizing this, ducks, pulling Harry and Misato down behind
the barricade.  Aeka continues to lay down covering fire.

LINA:	I hereby pledge myself to darkness, against all who stand to oppose me. 
All fools that stand in our way shall be annihilated by the power that we both
possess!

	Aeka ducks as Lina emerges from behind the counter.
	
LINA:	DRAGON SLAVE!!!

	In the main control room, Ryoko dusts off her hands, and then is nearly
upset from her standing position by the sudden shockwave.  The force of the
explosion in a tight space would make one think that Fifth Impact had occoured.

	Several hours later, in what's left of the NERV briefing room...the
battle-weary combatants are assembled around the scorched, blasted, and
bullet-riddled table.  The only remaining chair has been commandeered by Gendo. 
Most people are seated on bits of debris, milk crates, anything reasonably
effective.  Around the table:

Shinji Ikari (Angst-filled Eva pilot)
Asuka Langley Sorhyu (Condescending Eva Pilot)
Ryoko (Genetically-engineered space pirate)
Lina Inverse (Beautiful genius sorceress...but NEVER mention her chest)
Harry Potter (Young Wizard in training, famed for overthrowing the Dark Lord)
Gendo Ikari (Shinji's Father, Commander of NERV)
Fuyutski (Gendo's right-hand man)
Ritsuko Akagi (The doc of NERV)
Misato Katsuragi (NERV Operations Commander)
Aeka Jurai (First princess of Jurai)
Newjersey Silverwolf (Lycanthropic archaeologist, specialist in the Aekaprise
Crew)

GENDO:	Captain Katsuragi, your report.

MISATO:	<looking scorched> We managed to secure the Geofront and drive off the
AHRLI's, but we sustained great losses.  Our security force is at 20%, and it
will take months to repair the battle damage.

GENDO:	Dr. Akagi.

RITSUKO:	Eva units 01 and 02 were returned to the cage intact, though they
both are in need of repairs to the outer casing.  It looked like they were
going at each other with progressive knives.

GENDO:	Shinji, Asuka, do you know what kind of trouble you are in?

SHINJI:	I've had it up to here with her, father.  But if I don't pilot Eva-01,
nobody else can.

GENDO:	That doesn't matter.  Shinji, Asuka, you're both grounded.  You're both
to be home by seven after school and there will be no TV or video games.

ASUKA:	WHAT?!

SHINJI:	Cool!

ASUKA:	Shinji, you idiot, he just grounded us!  He isn't even my father!

SHINJI:	Are you kidding?  This is the first time he's actually treated me like
his son!

ASUKA:	....

RITSUKO:	Now, on to new business, we have to assemble the group for another
fic...

NEWJERSEY:	Wait a second...don't we get a break after that firefight?

GENDO:	No.

RITSUKO:	As I was saying before I was interrupted...we need to assemble a
group for the fic.  As Shinji has just been grounded, he is sidelined this
time.  As are you, Ryoko.

RYOKO:	WOOHOO!

AEKA:	Wait a minute!  I thought I was supposed to be going home!

MISATO:	Apparently not.

AEKA:	AZAKA!  KAMIDAKE!  I COMMAND YOU TO PUT THAT SCOUNDREL TO DEATH!

RITSUKO:	I hate to break it to you, Aeka, but the Guardians are presently
being repaired.

AEKA:	DAMMIT!

RITSUKO:	At any rate, we now have two open slots for the MSTing crew.  So,
we...

	Suddenly, a figure in a white cloak with long flowing blond hair, huge
earrings, and a rounded conical hat materializes in the room.  She is
recognizable as Filia Ul Copt, the dragon maiden from Slayers Try.

FILIA:	Sorry, am I late, I...

	Filia catches sight of Lina.
	
FILIA AND LINA:	<pointing at each other> What are you doing here?!  Don't ask
me, I don't know!  How'd you get roped into this, anyway?

RITSUKO:	Filia, glad you could make it.  You're right on time.  This is
Filia Ul Copt, former priestess of the Fire Dragon King.  She will be filling
in one of the seats for the MST crew.

LINA:	Why are you here?

FILIA:	I took a wrong turn somewhere and...well...I want to go home.  I heard
this place had some way to get me back.

NEWJERSEY:	Great.  Another victim of the causality hole.

RITSUKO:	Well, the next guest is kind of a long shot.  We had to do some
tricky work with the causality hole to bring him into play.

	Enter an orange-clad Super Sayin with spiky black hair.  The person is
Goku, from the Dragonball series.

GOKU:	Hi!  I'm Goku!  Nice working with you people!

FILIA:	Um...hello...

LINA:	You brought Goku into this?

HARRY:	Who's Goku?

NEWJERSEY:	You don't know who Goku is?

HARRY:	I don't watch much TV.

RITSUKO:	Goku's abilities as a Super Sayin will be helpful in dealing with
the upcoming fic...

AEKA:	Okay...hold on.  Before you go any further...what is the upcoming fic? 
If it's another ode to Ryoko...

MISATO:	This one's a bad one, guys.  Believe me, you'll need everything you've
got for this.

GOKU:	Got for what?  Are we recovering the Dragonballs or not?

LINA:	Uh...Goku...we're going to need to brief you before we do this.

GOKU:	Do what?

GENDO:	Go to first stage alert.  All of you, into the theater.

MISATO:	Goku, Filia, you'll find the plug suits in the locker room.

FILIA:	 Plug suits?

AEKA:	We'll explain when we get there.

	The 6 MSTers enter the Entry Theater.  The seating order is...The seating
order is, from left to right, Aeka, Newjersey, Filia, Goku, Lina, and Harry. 
Watching in the control block in Central Dogma is Ritsuko, Misato, Maya,
Shigeru, and Makato.

RITSUKO:	Filling the Entry Theater.

FILIA:	What...what is this stuff?!

GOKU:	Uh oh...

RITSUKO:	Power supply connected.  Commencing activation system.  Initiating
first stage connections.   Voltage climbing to border-line.  Initiating second
stage connections.  Theatre has activated.

MISATO:	Do you have any idea what the hell you just said?

RITSUKO:	I used to, I'm not so sure anymore.

MISATO:	Oh well.  LAUNCH!

even the most seasoned MSTer.

LINA:	Oh you will, Filia.  By the end of this, you will.

GOKU:	What speed...what incoherence!  I'm having trouble following this!

NEWJERSEY:	Supposedly you're incredibly fast, being a Super Sayin.  That's why
you were brought here, to help us combat this.

LINA:	We should have treasured that first line, where he made proper use of
the period key.

>"This is my lab & no one gets in unless I say so" 
>so the figure replied in a voice Washu had heard before but 
>couldn't place "well can I come in?".

AEKA:	<as Washu> Hmm, let me think.  NO!  *BLAM! BLAM!*

NEWJERSEY:	I think I see the problem.  The author appears to use periods in
places where punctuation isn't necessary, thus creating a period shortage.

generate Light Hawk Wings without the need of a starship, you don't need the
bod of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

FILIA:	Hold on...why's he using a linear measurement for a volumetric
quantity?

AEKA:	Moreover...Ryoko might not be my favorite person in the world but she
does not knock down sake daily!

NEWJERSEY:	You're trying to find sense in an Adam Redmond fic.  Don't. 
Sometimes it's not worth the effort.

HARRY:	<as Tenchi> Okay, "hi back."  Satisfied?

calling TENCHI ignorant?

>or aren't you glad I came back?" then it dawned on Tenchi, he 

NEWJERSEY:	...wasn't glad Adam came back.  He activated the Tenchi-ken and
swiftly cut through the space Adam was occupying, ending his life and freeing

hentai mallet.

NEWJERSEY:	I may be a gentleman...but be forewarned, if any woman gives me a
reason I will pay her back for this.

FILIA:	<tail sticking out> You'd hit a woman?!

LINA:	Filia, it's his version of gender equality.  It's not like there are
any weak women in Anime anyway.

AEKA:	Uh...WHY?!

NEWJERSEY:	It's one of his SI powers.  He listed off a bunch of them in the
last fic we got from him.  Any anibabes are instantly attracted to him.

FILIA:	But...all I'm feeling right now about Adam <tail sticks out> is
hostility!

LINA:	Yeah, he only has the animal magnetism in his wildest dreams.

>&

alien tenants.

NEWJERSEY:	Passive voice doesn't tell me anything.  Who disapproved of the
arrangement?  Tenchi?  Adam?  Washu?  Yosho?

AEKA:	Oh dear...on second thought I wouldn't even wish THAT on Shin Ryoko.

FILIA:	<as Washu> I have a nice paper-lined cage to keep him in, too.  Hope
you like hamster wheels, Adam.

LINA:	Eh, he spent most of the first 'Tales of Adam' in a comatose state, she
would be used to it.

Adam in close proximity.

GOKU:	...then the sofa immediately asked for his license and proof of
insurance.

NEWJERSEY:	<as Mihoshi> Well, looks like I'll have to put you under arrest for
writing while under the influence!

>first Ryoko 
>sat on the beam to see if he changed his clothes

LINA:	That's disgusting.  He probably hasn't changed his clothes in years.

NEWJERSEY:	You're not kidding.  I can smell him across the AT field.

HARRY:	...and mowed down everyone in the house with a glock.  Then he put the
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.  The end.

FILIA:	WOW.  That is dark.  Harry, you are scaring me...

HARRY:	Filia, this is a normal reaction to this kind of fic.  You hope for a
quick end by any means necessary.

NEWJERSEY:	...still-beating heart...

AEKA:	Newjersey, Washu is not homicidal.

NEWJERSEY:	No, but she is the most genius scientist in the universe, and I
would not insult her intelligence by implying that she wouldn't make the smart
move.

AEKA:	Hmmm...you do have a point.

GOKU:	Given the aptitude of this author, shouldn't it be called the
"Fisher-Price?"

NEWJERSEY:	Nah, that's too advanced.  "Playskool" would be more appropriate.

NEWJERSEY:	Okay...I'm having visions of a hideous mixture of body parts from
Washu and Ryoko, with purple hair and red eyeballs in strange places.

Lovecraft.

medical professionals!

NEWJERSEY:	You know...we did NOT need the SI background combined with the
shitty grammar!

>he decided to gather his friends with healing abilitys & draw 
>blood from them & himself, mix it & inject Hiwa.

HARRY:	Oh, what a plan.  Load her up with who-knows-how-many blood-borne
pathogens and incorrect blood types.

FILIA:	<as Adam> The good news is, you're not dying from a fanfic-spawned
disease.  The bad news is, you're now infected with HIV, herpes, Hepatitis A
and B, and Ebola Zaire.

>He told Hiwa the 
>plan, when she heard him say that he was half vampire she got very 
>scared but then she calmed down & agreed to have it done, but

LINA:	...Then she panicked because she realized it was Adam doing this.
 
>first Adam needed a sample of her blood & she was blood type o, & 
>this is the blood type that mixes with any other.

NEWJERSEY:	No, O is the "universal donor" because the red blood cells don't
present A or B antigens.  Type O blood can be donated to anybody because the
anti-A and anti-B antibodies can't cause agglutination of red blood cells.

AEKA:	Where are you going with this little biology lesson?

NEWJERSEY:	Well, if Hiwa's blood type is O, her body is producing both anti-A
and anti-B antibodies.  If Adam starts throwing in blood of any type other than
O, the antibodies in her bloodstream will agglutinate the introduced blood
cells.  The cell agglutinations will be like blood clots.

LINA:	Could you just get to the damn point alre...

NEWJERSEY:	<interrupting Lina> IN PLAIN ENGLISH...because Adam doesn't know
his blood types, he'll cause Hiwa to have a stroke, suffer brain damage, and
most likely die.

>So the next day 
>Adam set off on his quest for blood & sent the others on a quest 
>in a different world for a Phoenix Feather.

HARRY:	You know, you could probably get them at any general store in the area
of Furinkan.

> Adam Visited Woverine 
>from the x-men 

LINA:	<as Wolverine> I told you never to come back to this dimension, bub.

>& got a sample of blood & a date with Rogue, 

GOKU:	Uh, quick hint here, giving Wolverine a cut and trying to smear his
blood all over your hand does not constitute a blood sample.  Nor does having
Rogue absorb your powers so she can kick the shit out of you constitute a date.

>then 
>he visited Morrigan & Lilth for blood, they was glad to give him 
>some in return for a kiss,

AEKA:	...though when he kissed Lilith, he merged with her and suddenly
ignited Third Impact in that dimension.

>he then met with Demitri for blood, 
>Demitri agreed only if he could bite Adam & they struck this deal,

	There is a pause, the MSTers blink as they absorb this image, and then
everyone vomits into the LCL.

FILIA:	DISGUSTING!

GOKU:	The fic, or the fact that we vomited into the same stuff we have to
breathe?

FILIA:	The fic!  I can see less of it with this crud floating around...
 
>Adam next went & got blood from Adrian Farinheight Tepes alis 
>Alucard in return for an item that Adam reproduced using his

NEWJERSEY:	Precious blood in exchange for the time of day.  Methinks Adrian
got ripped off.

>up with them

LINA:	...they got in Ryo-ohki and did a drive-by on the Tendo Dojo.

HARRY:	<as a Harlem Gangster> Yo, homies, we was attacked by dis bug, see?

AEKA:	<ditto> Word.

ALL:	<monotone> Yay.

>& they soon got to the Phoenix's lair, when they found the Phoenix

NEWJERSEY:	It must be the hideous fusion of Tarot and Elemental!

REST OF CAST: What?

NEWJERSEY:	Check out Cav and Dav's MST of "The Switch."  The fic sucks but the
MST is masterfully done.

into Adam's neck and snapped his spinal column like a twig.

NEWJERSEY:	<as the Phoenix> Aw, hell, Adam, not YOU again!

>"Thank you for ending my misery & defeating that creature,

GOKU:	<as the Phoenix> I read this fic too, so I know why you're here.

>& with that Hiwa walked forward & Phoenix spoke again "don't

AEKA:	...phoenix droppings...

>& soon after the glow faded & when Adam scaned here using a

FILIA:	<as Ryoko> so Adam's a transvestite into bestiality.  I never would
have guessed.  <The rest of the cast stares at her> What?  You know a good riff
like that at the right time will make a Mazoku's head explode.

HARRY:	Uh uh.  Sorry.  You said you had advanced healing abilities, so that
mark should be gone by now.

>"look it isn't what it looks like,

NEWJERSEY:	Okay, stop right there.  Telling a woman that in Anime is a sure
way to end up in low earth orbit.  If a guy in an awkward situation tells a
girl "it isn't what it looks like" or "it's not what you think," the first
thing she's going to think is "oh it really IS what it looks like."

FILIA:	Isn't that a little unfair?

NEWJERSEY:	Just reporting observations.

NEWJERSEY:	Why would Kiyone be worried about...oh yeah, it's that "chick
magnet" effect the SI seems to have.

be so worried if I knew he was *guaranteed* to get killed...

equation somewhere.

after all.

>Kagato who just turned & swated him like a fly 

HARRY:	WOOHOO!  Go Kagato!

NEWJERSEY:	You're actually cheering on the bad guy?

HARRY:	Adam's the real bad guy here, remember?

NEWJERSEY:	True.  That psychic blast of his must have had enough power to
toast a whole eighth of a slice of bread.

Filia.

AEKA:	Hold on, Adam's on one side, Tenchi's on the other, how can they be
holding the same hand?

GOKU:	Maybe Tenchi's really a Super Sayin.

AEKA:	Seems a bit overdone in terms of powers, but better Tenchi than Adam.

man at all, so that should go without saying.

LINA:	Don't tell us.  "The pattern is blue."  The fic is an Angel.

MISATO:	<ICW> how did you know?

NEWJERSEY:	Think about it.  If a fic is this bad, either the fic or the author
is the evil target that must be destroyed.  Since the author isn't here...well,
use your deduction.

GOKU:	I guess this is why they wanted me in here, huh?

having "the talk?"

LINA:	Where he was eaten by wolves.  The end.

	Newjersey growls.
	
LINA:	What?  I know it's an overgeneralization, usually wolves don't attack
humans unless they see them as a genuine threat.  But don't you think any means
of his demise would be acceptable?

NEWJERSEY:	It's still a debasement to wolves, implying that we'd have anything
to do with his flesh!

LINA:	What do you suggest, then?

	Newjersey pulls his pistols out.
	
LINA:	Ah.

>Lunchtime came & went

FILIA:	This can't be good.

GOKU:	Why?  He's gone!

body on hand to be sure he's dead!

HARRY:	<as Ash> It's a trick.  Get an axe.

>& they went back to the house to discover 
>a note from Adam which said: 'I must leave as I have some business

FILIA:	Just put the watches in the incenerator, then.  Redmond wrote this fic
so nothing's really going to happen.

> so everyone 
>took a watch & on each was a name 

AEKA:	Funny, this watch has the name "Mavado" engraved on it.

>& when they said the name a

LINA:	So they have a watch that talks, calls up an annoying SI, and probably
can't indicate the correct time.  Wow.  What service.

> Washu looked at hers & smiled 
>& to her surprise hers said "don't take me apart as I will self-

GOKU:	Okay, let's try this.

	Goku stands up, and in the blink of an eye, leaps off his seat, directing a
devastating punch at the screen.  However, the AT field bounces him back, and
he caroms off the celing and rear wall before landing on the floor again.

GOKU:	OW!  What was that?!

NEWJERSEY:	An AT field.  Usually you need another AT field to erode the phase
space, but if you direct a lot of brute force at it, it'll crack.  The problem
is, it takes an incredible amount of force.

>disappered & how did he know when to save Tenchi "well I went a 
>visited a grave, my wife's grave to be exact..."

LINA:	No woman would be caught dead with him, though.  Literally, in this
case.

> "I'm sorry I.." 
>Its alright I feel better now & I came to save Tenchi because when 
>I came back I saw them point weapons at Tenchi's room

AEKA:	So now the author claims credit for saving Tenchi.  Well if the author
hadn't written that part about weapons being pointed at Lord Tenchi, he
wouldn't have needed saving, now would he?!

>" Ryoko not 
>sure what to do now becasue she had planed 

FILIA:	Plane...to smooth wood by shaving it, as with a planing tool.  So
Ryoko's into carpentry?

>to ask him what he felt 
>about her & as she thought about what to do, Adam spoke, almost as 
>is reading her mind " Ryoko I feel for you but I don't want you to 
>be hurt either by me or Tenchi & almost all the women who I have 
>been close to are dead or badly injured,

HARRY:	If he looked closely, he'd see that all of those wounds were
self-inflicted.

> thats another thing that 
>made me put up a wall to prevent from having to suffer like that 
>again" "Adam I want a truthful answer, did you read my mind?"

NEWJERSEY:	<as Adam> Read it?  Hell, I wrote it!

> Adam 
>just looked at her & she smiled "well?" "no" came the reply & then 
>they looked at each other, Adam gazing into Ryokos

LINA:	Oh, so there's more than one Ryoko now?  Washu must have been cloning
around in the lab again...oh forget it!  Screw the pun, where's the damn
apostrophe?!

> amber eyes & 
>Ryoko looking in to the shadow that covers Adams face. Then 
>suddenly they pushed each other off the roof & into the lake 

AEKA:	Okay, doesn't this violate some laws of physics?  Even ANIME physics?

>where 
>they where splashing each other & then after a while they raced to 
>the other side of the lake, Adam let Ryoko win 

FILIA:	I swear, that ego needs a sound smack with Mace-Sama.

>& then when he 
>admitted it while they sat on the side of the peir Ryoko pushed 
>him off but he just floated in mid-air

HARRY:	He can dish it out but he can't take it.

> & settled back next to her 
>& when he sat there for a while she put her head on his shoulder, 

AEKA:	<as Ryoko> See, Adam?  I'm decapitating myself just for you!  How does
my head look attatched to your shoulder?

>he put his arm around her shoulders & they sat & watched the 
>sunrise together.
>
>That day they sat & played a few games on the Playstation,

NEWJERSEY:	...then they found that sitting on a Playstation game console is
not too good for its normal operation.  The game of hopscotch they attempted
pretty much finished it off.

> teased 
>Ayeka, helped Sasami, sabotged some of Washu's expirments 

GOKU:	<still charging> Mmf...well...they didn't...get
to...her...*experiments* or they'd really...be hosed!

>& 
>basicly doing things together. Washu was treating Adam just like 
>she does Tenchi, & so were the others execpt for Kiyone who was 
>being flirtious all the time with Adam.

ALL BUT GOKU:	<Cough> BULLSHIT!

> They went to town the 
>following day & they went shopping together played games in the 
>arcade & basicly had a good time & when they got back they got 
>changed & packed a lunch & Adam created a portal 

LINA:	Adam, here is a lesson.  This (&) is an ampersand.  This (.) is a
period.  You are supposed to use the PERIOD to end sentences!

>& they left on an 
>interdimential picnic. They went to a peaceful world sat down in a 
>beautiful field of various flowers & afer a whlie they had 
>something to eat & just sat there talking & then as they were 
>about to kiss there was voice

AEKA:	<as the voice> Ryoko...slay this man when he least expects it...then
burn his remains.

> "Ahem, well, well looky here if it 
>isn't Adam" Adam looked & saw Cupid standing there "won't The boss 
>be pleased to her that your here with another woman"

FILIA:	If I'm not mistaken, Eros, a.k.a. Cupid, is a god, so wouldn't he be
the boss?

HARRY:	Maybe he's referring to himself in the third person.

> "Cupid, we 
>finished a long time ago me & your 'boss' so just leave us in 
>peace & do your job" "but I'm being put out of a job with you 
>around"

NEWJERSEY:	<as Cupid> With you around, females are becoming celibate by the
billions!

> " well I'm sure that if I pull a few strings down 
>below..."

LINA:	Because hell seems to be a great place for outsourced dieties.

> "hey no need for that I'll leave. humph" Cupid left them 
>in peace & it was time to get back. "I have an idea, why don't we 
>phone Tenchi & say I'm staying with you for tonight?" "good idea! 

ALL:	NO!  WRONG!  BAD IDEA!

>if you want Washu to use her machine to open a portal to my bed 
>room by locking onto you & then she has the co-ordinates of my 
>bed! even better!" said Adam sarcasticly "well you have a point.. 
>I know you can stay in my room" " but can I trust you to keep to 
>yourself?"

AEKA:	Only as far as you can throw him, Ryoko.

> "ooohh, I don't know maybe you can, maybe you can't but 
>theres one way to find out!" & with that they left for Tenchi's 
>house.

FILIA:	I hope she brings protection.  A Glock should be sufficient.

>
>chapter 9: A4R4eva?

NEWJERSEY:	What now, a love triangle between Adam, Ryoko, and an Evangelion?

>
>The following day Adam & Ryoko were just sitting there doing 
>nothing,

LINA:	<as Ryoko> ...and not even a bottle of Viagra will get THAT to satisfy
me, Adam!

> when suddenly there was a chill & the from the water 
>rose, to Ryoko's horror, Kagato 

HARRY:	Apparently someone forgot to flush.

>" what? I fried you! you was a 
>scorch mark! how the?" "you are certinly powerful I will grant you 
>that but I don't die very easy unlike Tenchi..."

NEWJERSEY:	<as Kagato> Instead, I die very easily unlike Kagato!

> & with that 
>something that looked like Tenchi rose

AEKA:	<fuming> Tenchi Rose?!  LORD TENCHI, AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU
RUN OFF WITH SOME AMERICAN SLUT?!

FILIA:	AEKA!  Calm down, you're reading too deeply!  And this is a Redmond
fic, after all!

> from the water & was very 
>limp as if it had drowned

GOKU:	Hmmm...the water had drowned in itself.  Very Zen.  Let us meditate on
that...

REST OF CAST:	GOKU!  CHARGE YOUR KAMEHAMEHA ALREADY!!!

GOKU:	Oops...right.  <keeps charging his chi>

> "Tenchi!!! you bastard" you must die!" & 

NEWJERSEY:	<as Ryoko> ...you stole all my proper quotes" & all my periods too"

>with blinding speed Ryoko tried to implale Kagato with her 
>beamsword but he had moved & she had impaled the Tenchi clone 

LINA:	<sarcastically> Way to keep suspense there, Redmond.

>instead Ryoko screamed as Kagato disappered laughing. Adam checked 
>the fake Tenchi over & said "that bastard! although it looked like 
>Tenchi, it wasn't"

AEKA:	<as Adam> I read the narrative.

> Adam turned to Ryoko who was shaking badly even 
>when she knew it was fake she just couldn't stop shaking 

FILIA:	Oh no, Ryoko's having an epileptic fit!

>& even 
>when Adam held her she still shook. "get some rest & tell Tenchi 
>how you feel about him, it'll make you feel better & who knows he 
>may say he loves you back" & Ryoko just looked at him & they both 
>sat by the waters edge holding each other.

HARRY:	<as Ryoko> HANDS OFF, YOU HENTAI!

>
>It was quiet for the next few days, in the way that Kagato didn't 
>show up or ant trouble for that matter. 

NEWJERSEY:	A couple of cans of Raid take care of everything.

FILIA:	Except this fic?

NEWJERSEY:	Got a point.

>Adam & Ryoko had decieded 
>to go away for a few days to recover from what happened. Adam & 
>Ryoko had gone to a place that was very peaceful & whilst they 
>were there they visited some friends of both Adam & Ryoko,

LINA:	Okay, so if we're looking at friend of both Adam AND Ryoko...that is,
any person who was a friend of both Adam AND Ryoko...then...they visited
nobody.

> Ash 
>Ketchum, Misty & Brock, the pokemon trainers, "say isnt your 
>Pikachu getting a little, well..." said Misty as Pikame was 
>attacking a tree with various powerful attacks like Solar beam, 
>"what makes you think that?" replied Adam as Pikame settled down 
>to rest beside his master. When suddenly they all heard "To, oh, 
>look! its Adam!"

HARRY:	<as Ash Ketchum> Pikachu!  Thundershock!

> "Will you stop drooling & continue with the 
>motto" "yeah, Jessie" cried James & Meowth. "look we better get 
>back Ryoko, it was nice seeing you Ash. bye" Adam opened a portal 
>and left with Ryoko trailing behind him. When they got back, all 
>hell broke loose.

FILIA:	I.e., he wrote another fic.

GOKU:	KAME-HAME-HA!!!!

	Goku's Chi blast would put the positron cannon to shame, as it rips a hole
in the AT field and pierces the fic.  As the fic gives one last gasp...

>
>read Kagato's return for the rest.
>

ALL:	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

NEWJERSEY:	<shifting werewolf and clawing at the emergency hatch> LET US OUT
OF HERE, DAMMIT!  LET US OUT!!!

FILIA:	Oh sweet Cephied...

FIN

AUTHOR'S NOTES:	Sadly I wish this MST could have gone better and not turned
into one big uberrant.  There is only so much one can do between one's
imagination and the fic, which I may add, has been the most headache-inducing
work I've ever encountered.
	The End of Evangelion-esque segment prior to the fic I wrote in as a
response to the possibility that the prior MST of Ryoko's Love would anger some
people who...well...would not look at the lighter side of a good fic.  I may
break off from this series for a while until I can find more Excedrin.
