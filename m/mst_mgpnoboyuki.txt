*********************************
On to the MST...
*********************************

The new fanfic theater has been built and is ready to MST its
first fic, "Magical Girl Pretty NOBOYUKI!!!"


The first MSTers are:

Timothy Turner:  The author of this MST and a loser.

Mark Rothlisberger:  Friend of Tim's and also a loser.

Duo Maxwell:  Gundam pilot.  We know who this person is.

Keiichi Morisato:  "Aa! Megami-sama!"'s loser who isn't quite
a loser anymore because of that lucky call.  With Belldandy
at his side.

Belldandy remains quiet most of the time in this MST.

*********************************

The lobby is empty except for the MSTers.

Tim looks at his watch and nods his head, "Just about time."

"What are we MSTing for the first fic?," Mark asks.

"Magical Girl Pretty NOBOYUKI," Keiichi refreshes Mark's memory.

Duo shakes his head, "And a lemon I might add."

"Let's get it over with," Keiichi says with a hinting tone in
his voice, "Got a date with Belldandy tonight.  Right?"

"Yes," Belldandy says plainly.

They all walk into the dimming theater.

>Magical Girl Pretty NOBOYUKI!!!

>A senseless fic from a senseless person, AAA-PhuckNut !!

Tim:  And with senseless sex too.

>Disclaimer:
>I dont own these characters, but AIC and Pioneer do.
>This fic contains sex so you have to be 18+ to read it.

Mark:  I do not own any farts in this lemon.

>Tenchi and Ryoko lovers rejoice!!

>This isnt really related to the Pretty Sammy series, but Noboyuki goes
>insane, and I needed a funny title :P

Duo:  I remember the episode of Pretty Sammy when Nobuyuki did that.  Don't
you?
___________________________________________________________________________

>Yet again it was just another normal day at the Masaki household.

Tim:  Is any day at Tenchi's house normal?

Mark:  Babes greet me when I wake up!

Keiichi:  ::Sarcastically laughs.::  And babes pop out of mirrors, too!  

>Tenchi just woke up to the sound of Ayeka and Ryoko fighting over him
>outside of his door,

>"God... Not those two fighting again!" complained Tenchi.

>"I know they're fighting over me.. I love them both equally though.. or
>do I?  I seem so attracted to Ryoko for some reason.  Maybe its because
>she never had anyone to love her, and I feel like it is my duty to show
>her affection, a feeling that no one has ever given her before." Tenchi
>said to himself.

>"Hmmmm..." Tenchi sighed.

>"Thats it!  Today im going to show her that I truly love her and end this
>silly fighting!" exclaimed Tenchi.

Tim:  You show those women who's boss!

Keiichi:  Uh, huh.  Yeah...

>Tenchi then got dressed and snuck past Ryoko and Ayeka who were too busy
>fighting to notice Tenchi.  On his way down to breakfast, a scary thought
>popped up in Tenchi's mind,

Duo:  ::Imitating Tenchi.::  Oh, no!  I left that rag and porn on my
bed!

>"Oh no! That bitch Sakuya still thinks I love her!! AARRGG!" Tenchi thought
>to himself.

Mark:  That's even scarier!

>"Oh well.. HEHEHE I have the perfect plan!!" Tenchi said to himself as an
>evil smile crossed his lips.

>Just then, out of the blue, came Noboyuki wearing a pink tutu and holding
>a paper mache wand,

>"AHAHAHAH!! I AM MAGICAL PRETTY GIRL NOBOYUKI!!!! AHAHAHAHAH" screamed a 
>very deranged Noboyuki.

Duo:  A perfectly sane Quatre would dress up like that!

>"I WILL MAKE EVERYONE LOVE EVERYONE!!!! AHAHHAHAHA!!!" screamed MPGNoboyuki
>as he skipped out the front door and headed to the bus stop.  ((MPGNoboyuki 
>stands for Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki, incase you didnt know :P) -AAA-PhuckNut)

>"Oh Great!! There goes dad acting insane again!! That dirty bastard!" Tenchi
>yelled.

Keiichi:  Don't you just hate it when your dad dresses up in a pink tutu and acts
insane?

>Tenchi ran to the kitchen and yelled to Sasami,

Keiichi:  ::Imitating Tenchi::  Sasami!  What kind of dolls do you keep in
that room of yours!?!?!?!

>"Sasami! Quick call the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum!! Dad thinks he's
>Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki again!!" Tenchi beamed.

>"NOO!! Not again!! This could be dangerous!!" Sasami said.

>Sasami then called the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum,

>"Hello! and welcome to the Shady Oaks Insane Asylum automated commiting
>a person to the asylum hotline!" said a robotic recording.

>"If you are being murdered by an insane criminal, please press 1 now."
>said the recording.

Tim:  ::Pretends to be stabbing himself and dials an imaginary phone::

Duo:  Thank you for calling...please hold until an operator is available
or you bleed to the point where you're already dead.  At which time, your call
will be automatically disconnected.

Keiichi:  ::Whistles music::

Mark:  ::Snoring::

Duo:  ::Beep::  People Being Murdered Depatment...may I help you?

Tim:  HELP!  I'VE BEEN BEING MURDERED FOR THE PAST HOUR!  AND I'VE BEEN
DISMEMBERED AND LOST ALL MY BLOOD, TOO!

Duo:  Sorry...you're dead.

Tim:  NOOOOOOO!!!!!

>"If you are the insane person, please press 2 now." said the recording.

Mark:  Tim, press 2.

Tim:  Go to hell!  You'll be pressing 1 if you don't shut up!

>"If Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki is on the loose again, please press
>3 now." said the recording

Tim:  And remember, Magical Girl Pretty Nobuyuki gets discount rates at
our luxurious facilities.  If Magical Girl Pretty Nobuyuki gets a hand
stamp and comes back the same day, he gets back in for free!  So remember
to bring the kiddies but keep them clothed and well away from Magical Girl
Pretty Nobuyuki!

Mark:  Offer void in Utah and U.S. Territories.  May be subject to price
variations in Hawaii and unavailable in Alaska.

>Sasami then pressed 3,

>"Thank you for choosing 3, please hold for an operator!" said the
>recording.

>Sasami waited patiently while some elevator played over the phone.
>Finally a operator came on,

Keiichi:  Damn!  Those elevators play over the phone all the time!
I wish they'd get a job and move out!

>"MGPNoboyuki is out again!!!" screamed the operator sounding very
>scared.

>"Yes he just came out!! He left the house and headed for the bus to
>Tokyo!" yelled Sasami.

>"OH GREAT!! THIS IS TERRIBLE!! Has he raped any small animals yet?!"
>said the operator.

Tim:  ::Imitating Sasami.::  He got Ryo-Ohki!

Mark:  Yeah...he got my cat.

>"No, not that I know of.. But you better hurry before he does!!"
>Sasmi said.

(But it was too late)

_________________________________________________________________________


>MGPNoboyuki skipped along through the woods until he ran into a squirel,

Duo:  Here we go.

>"HELLO MR. SQUIREL!! I AM MAGICAL GIRL PRETTY NOBOYUKI! I WILL SHOW
>YOU LOVE!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

Duo:  ::Imitates squirrel::  No thanks.  I'll have my nuts busted somewhere
else.  I don't think a squirrel and a deranged man in a tutu were ever meant
to be!

Keiichi:  ::Imitating Nobuyuki::  I'll bust more than your nuts, pudding boy!

>The squirel shrieked in terror as MGPNoboyuki grabbed onto the squirel,
>then he lifted his tutu and rammed his hard cock into the squirel's
>ass,

>"HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!!" yelled MGPNoboyuki.

>MGPNoboyuki's penis ripped through the squirel's entire body and popped
>out of the top of the squirel's head.

Mark:  If I were the squirel, I'd rather be hit by a car.

>Then the squirels body split in half and squirel blood covered MGPNoboyuki's cock.
>MGPNoboyuki then took the squirel's body and happily ate it,

Tim:  Someone's hungry for Chunky Soup today!

>"IT IS MY DUTY TO SHOW LOVE TO ALL THE CREATURES OF GODS PLANET!!" screamed
>MGPNoboyuki.

Duo:  It's your duty to find another wife before you do anymore acts of, um,
insanity!

>He then skipped off down the trail to the bus.

Tim:  LA-DEE-DA-DEE-DOO-DEE-DA!

__________________________________________________________________________


>"Well, I guess we shouldn't worry too much now, Sasami." said Tenchi.

>"Yeah, I guess so..  The insane asylum should take care of everything."
>said Sasami.

Duo:  And they'll give him a hot wax job too.

>"But dont you remember what happend last time?" said Sasami.

Mark:  They threw in a pine scented air freshener.

>"Yeah I know, it took 15 men to stop him from raping all those people in
>Tokyo, they practically beat him to death with night sticks." said Tenchi.

Tim:  Practically!?!?!

Mark:  Why didn't somebody just shoot him?!

>"Well I hope they can fix him permanently this time!" exclaimed Sasami.

Tim:  Pratically it hasn't worked the past billion times.

>"Me too.  Well I have to go take care of some business, Ill see ya later
>Sasami." said Tenchi.

>"Ok Tenchi see ya later!" Sasami said.

>Tenchi then left the kitchen and headed up the stairs to Ryoko's room.
>Tenchi arrived at her room and opened the door, and she wasnt there,

Duo:  ::In Tenchi's voice.::  She's off having a beer somewhere.  I
think I'll crash on her bed while she waits.

>"Hmm, she must be at her favorite tree, ill go there." Tenchi said to
>himself.

>Tenchi then went downstairs and headed out the door, avoiding Ayeka, who 
>was sitting on the couch watching TV.  Tenchi got outside safely and went
>to Ryoko's favorite tree, and he saw her laying up there on a branch,

Tim:  That's odd.  I thought Ayeka could smell Tenchi from a long way away.
Her Tenchi radar is malfunctioning.

>"Wow, she is so beautiful." Tenchi thought to himself when he saw her.

All men:  ::Sarcastically::  NO!?  REALLY?!

>"Hey Ryoko!" yelled Tenchi.

>Ryoko turned her head towards him, and then she saw it was Tenchi and
>she said,

Duo:  ::In Ryoko's voice.::  The restraining order says you can't come
within 500 yards of me!

>"Oh hi Tenchi!" then she teleported down next to him.

>"What brings you here?" asked Ryoko when she got next to him.

All men: ::Pretend to sneeze::  *Blowjob!*

>"Well, I was wondering if you wanted to take a walk with me, because
>I have to tell you something.

Mark:  ::As Tenchi:: I want you and Ayeka in a threesome.

>"Ok, sure." Ryoko said, sounding a little bit suprised.

All men::  ::Chanting::  GO TENCHI!  IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!

>They started to walk down a trail that leaded into the forest, then Tenchi
>spoke up,

>"Ryoko, what I wanted to tell you was that.. umm.. I..."

Keiichi:  I'm horny and want to do you!

::Belldandy casts a nasty glare at Keiichi but Keiichi's too into the
manly ritual dirty comments to notice.::

>Ryoko's heart started to flutter when she heard him say this,

Tim:  Ryoko's heart then flew out of her chest.

>"I love you!" exclaimed Tenchi.

All men:  YEAH!!!  WOO-HOO!!  GO FOR IT, TENCHI!!

>"Oh Tenchi!! You dont know how long I have waited for you to say that!!
>I love you so much too!!" exclaimed a VERY happy Ryoko.

Keiichi:  Correction:  Instead of very happy, it should be very horny.

Tim:  What's with you and the word "horny"?

Keiichi:  Uhhm, nothing!

>They then hugged each other and gazed into one another's eyes.  Their 
>faces slowly came closer and closer together until

Mark:  Their heads bumped!

>their lips were touching,

Mark:  D'oh!  Should've guessed.

>then they went into a deep kiss.  As they kissed, Ryoko moved her hands 
>all over Tenchi's chest,

Duo:  Shouldn't Tenchi be moving his hands all over Ryoko's chest?  That's
what I'd do!

>slowly moving downward untill she put her hands into his pants and massaged
>his growing erection,

Duo:  Gee, I wonder what's gonna happen next?

>"Oh TENCHI!! I want you so bad!!" exclaimed Ryoko.

"oh umm.. HEHE.. umm HEH." said a very nervous Tenchi.

All men:  LOSER!

>Ryoko then teleported them both to Tenchi's room, and she layed him
>down on the bed and she started to strip,

>"mmmmmm.." Ryoko moaned as she stripped her clothes off.

Duo:  This has more plot than the yaoi fics people put me in!

Tim:  Now this is how a lemon should go!  Moaning while stripping is
the ultimate teaser!

Duo:  And no Sasami in sight!

All:  AMEN!

>"My god.. she is so fucking gorgeous!!" Tenchi though to himself.

Keiichi:  Damn.  If a women was stripping for me, I'd go for it.

Belldandy:  ::Hits him with a lightning bolt::

-The theatre projector short-circuts and is broken.  Everyone gets up 
to get some more snacks.-

Keiichi:  Belldandy!  Why did you have to do that!?!?!

Belldandy:  You know my nature!  I wouldn't do such a thing!

Keiichi:  We're together for all eternity!  Why shouldn't you pleasure
me!?!?

::Belldandy zaps Keiichi again.::

Tim:  (Whispering to Mark)  Minus 50,000 points, ouch!

Mark:  ::Cringes.::  No kidding!

-The snack bar opens with Quatre behind the stand.-

Duo:  Hey, Quatre!  What are you doing here?

Quatre:  I own this place!

Duo:  No kidding!?

Quatre:  Yep.  ::Looks evilly at Duo.::  Stay here for a while...

Duo:  Nope!  Gotta get going!  Hilde is probably woried about me!
::Slides toward the door.::

Quatre:  I meant *STAY HERE!*  Rasheem!

::Rasheem and Quatre's minions block all the exits.::

Quatre:  I heard that little remark you made about me earlier.  Now
I have to punish you all by bombarding you with fics (mostly lemons)
for a LONG TIME!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!

Duo:  ::Sweat drop.::

Everyone else, in a sarcastic tone:  GEE!!  THANKS A LOT, DUO!

Duo:  Sorry!

Quatre:  Get your snacks and get back into that theater!

-Everyone gets some things to eat and drink and pile back into the
theater after eating.-

>Ryoko finished taking her clothes off and started to take Tenchis off.
>She took his pants off and then got on top of him, stradling his waist.
>She then slowly sat on Tenchi's cock, sliding it up her wet, tight, virgin
>pussy.

Tim:  This ought to release some pent up stress!

>"oooohhh Tenchi, ive always wanted my first to be with you." said Ryoko.

>"Ive always wanted my first to be with you too." said Tenchi.

Mark:  Is there something wrong with this picture?

Tim:  Like how Tenchi never wanted to do it with them in the first place
and now he says he  has always wanted to do it with Ryoko on his first
time?

Mark:  My point exactly.

>"Wow she's a virgin?? I never would have guessed that by the way she acts!"
>Tenchi thought to himself.

>Ryoko started to bounce on him faster and faster,

Keiichi:  ::Imitating Tenchi.::  Ryoko!  *OOF*  Stop!  *OOF!*  You're  *OOF!*
hurting me!

>"RYOKO!! YES!!!" screamed Tenchi as he blew his load into her.

Duo:  Wow!  That was a fast time until orgasm!

>"OOOOOHH YESSSS TENCHIIIIIII!!" screamed Ryoko as she orgasmed shortly after
>Tenchi.

>Then they slowed down and got off each other and went into a deep kiss,

Tim:  They sure regained their energy quickly.

>"I love you so much!" said Ryoko.

>"I love you too Ryoko, that was soooo good..." said Tenchi.

>Then they kissed each other some more and eventually fell asleep...

Mark:  Then Ayeka walked in and kicked their asses...
____________________________________________________________________________


>MGPNoboyuki neared the bus stop, he had already raped 3 squirels, 2 dogs, and
>a goat,

Duo:  I knew that goat thing was coming!

Keiichi:  ::Imitating Adam Sandler.::  AH!  F*** me in the goat ass!

>"NOW I WILL GO TO THE CITY AND SHOW LOVE TO EVERYONE!!! AHAHAHHAHAHA!" screamed
>MGPNoboyuki.

>Just as he got close to the bus stop, he saw the all to common sight, to him, of
>the white paddy wagon with its sirens on speeding his way,

>"THE ANTI-LOVE MEN HAVE COME TO STOP MY LOVE!! I MUST RUN!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

>He then ran back as fast as he could to the house.  When he got to the house and
>came to the front gate he saw Azaka and Kamidake.

>"AHAHAHA!! I MUST SHOW MY FRIENDS LOVE!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki as he headed
>right towards Azaka.

>"Ah, greetings sir!" said Azaka as MGPNoboyuki headed towards him.

>"Um sir? May I ask why you are wearing that womans dress?" asked Azaka.

Tim:  Wouldn't they have data on Nobuyuki's illness by now?

>"I WILL SHOW YOU LOVE MY LOG FRIEND!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

Mark:  We don't want to see your love log or show love to the log friends!

>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Azaka screamed.

>MGPNoboyuki quickly grabbed ahold of Azaka, and plunged his penis into
>Azaka's little electric eye thingy.  His penis shattered the glass eye,
>and destroyed all the electronics inside.

Duo:  Must have been some small electronics, unless it was long...

Keiichi:  That's an image I did NOT want in my mind!

>MGPNoboyuki was in pure ecstasy as the broken glass and sharp electric components
>ripped up his penis.

All men, crossing their legs over their privates with a painful look on their faces:
NO MAN WOULD BE IN THAT STATE OF MIND IN THIS CASE!!!!

>Blood started pouring from his penis,

>"AHHHHHHHH-----" was all Azaka could say before he lost power.

>Kamidake was smart and already ran away when MGPNoboyuki attacked Azaka.
>MGPNoboyuki pulled his penis out of Azaka and cried at what he saw,

>"NOOOOO MY LOVE STICK HAS BEEN DESTROYED!! HOW CAN I SHOW LOVE TO 
>EVERYONE NOW??!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

Mark:  What happened to the papier mache wand?

>MGPNoboyuki's penis was a bloody mangled mess of shreds of skin and stuff.

All:  ::*PUKE!!!!*::  ::The men puke extra hard.::

::Quatre's laughing can be heard from the projection room, but pukes after
watching the scene above.::

>"I GOT IT!! I WILL JUST MAKE MYSELF BECOME REBORN SO I WILL HAVE A NEW
>LOVE STICK!!!!" exclaimed a very happy MGPNoboyuki.

>MGPNoboyuki then ran into the house and into the kitchen, where Sasami
>was,

All:  DEAR JESUS, NO!!!!!  NOT A SASAMI SEX SCENE!!!!!!!  ANYTHING BUT
THAT!!!!!!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

>"Oh no!!!! HES HERE!!!" screamed Sasami, unfortuneatly no one heard her.

>"YOU WILL HOLD MY REBORN FETUS!!!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

>He then grabbed a knife and sliced his scrotum off.  He took his nuts
>and broke them open and grabbed onto Sasami and shoved them up her 
>pussy,

>"OH GOD HELP MEEEEEEEEE!!!!!" screamed Sasami.

All:  -_-;;

>"AHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHA!!!!! NOW TO GO BECOME REBORN!!!" screamed MGPNoboyuki.

>MGPNoboyuki then ran out of the house with the knife and stabbed himself
>in the head so that he could be reborn.  Then knife punctured the side
>of his skull and went straight through his brain, he died a few seconds
>later.  Of course, he was insane and he wasnt reborn..

Mark:  And the fic's over!  THE END!

Quatre:  Not so fast!

Mark:  NO!!!!!
_________________________________________________________________________


>Tenchi woke up and looked over to see Ryoko still asleep.  Just then
>Ayeka burst into the room and saw a naked Tenchi and Ryoko hugging
>each other in bed.

Mark:  See?  Markstradmaus!  That should be my new name!

>"YOU DEMON!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO TENCHI!!" screamed Ayeka.

Duo:  What does it look like?

>"AYEKA!!" Tenchi yelled.

Keiichi:  ::As Tenchi.::  Ayeka, you can be my bitch, too!

>"Its.. its not her fault Ayeka.. I love her Ayeka.." Tenchi confessed.

>Ayeka ran out of the room crying and ran out of the house past 
>Noboyuki's bloody corpse, not even caring about it.  Ayeka headed out
>into the woods and found a tree and sat by it.

Tim:  That must have been one hell of a big knife to make a bloody corpse
by just being stabbed in the head!

Mark:  It's hard to find a tree in the woods.  It must taken Ayeka hours
to find that tree!

>"WHYYY!!! WHY DOES HE LOVE HER!!!!!!" screamed Ayeka.

>"How could he fall in love with that... that.. that DEMON!!" screamed
>Ayeka.

>Ayeka cried some more, then decided that she didnt belong here anymore.

>"He doesnt love me.. he loves HER.. I dont need to stay here.. IM
>LEAVING!!" yelled Ayeka.

>And at that she went back to the house and found Sasami balled up in
>a corner crying her eyes out,

>"Sasami!! Lets go we are leaving!!" yelled Ayeka.

>Ayeka then grabbed Sasami and they left, never to return.

Tim:  Ayeka was sure concerned with her little sister's mental trauma,
wasn't she?

__________________________________________________________________________


>"Theres still one thing I have to do, my love" Tenchi said to a sleeping
>Ryoko.

>"I must KILL THAT SAKUYA BITCH!!" screamed Tenchi, almost waking Ryoko up.

Duo:  Wouldn't a scream right next to a sleeping person wake them up?

>Tenchi then went to the phone and called up his 'old friend'.

>"Hello? God father?" said Tenchi.

Keiichi:  It's "Godfather"!

>"hmm Tenchi is that you?" said the voice with a heavy italian accent.

>"Yes, it is I, I need you to 'take care' of someone for me."

>Tenchi then told what he wanted to his Italian friend.

___________________________________________________________________________


>Sakuya sat in her shitty little hovel she calls home, thinking about
>Tenchi, when she heard a knock on the door.  Sakuya went and answered the
>door and saw 2 tall, strong looking, italian men wearing very expensive
>looking suits, and black sun glasses.

>"Good day miss, you must be Sakuya?" said the first man.

>"Yes my name is Sakuya. May I help you?" said a puzzled Sakuya.

>"Would you please come with us? A man named Tenchi would like to see you."
>said the man.

Tim:  We'd like you to be killed.

>Sakuya didnt want to go.. but then she heard him say Tenchi wanted to see
>her, so she went with them.  They arrived outside and they went over to
>the shiny black car, with black tinted windows.  She got in the back and 
>noticed there was a driver already waiting in the car.

>The ride was totally silent untill they reached their destination, but
>Sakuya was puzzled.. 

Tim:  Sakuya's pretty puzzled, hm?

>"Why are we at the docks?" asked Sakuya.

>"Your friend Tenchi is waiting for you on a yacht out at sea, we will get
>on a boat and head out to him." said one of the men.

Duo:  You don't mind if we give you a pair of cement shoes, do you?  We want
to see if women who lust after Tenchi sink with cement shoes.

>"Oh ok." said Sakuya.

>They hopped on a motor boat and headed out to the yacht.  They finally 
>arrived at the yacht.

Tim:  Must have been a long trip to the yacht.

>"Come, your friend awaits you." said one of the men.

>Sakuya and the men stepped off the boat and

Duo:  Into the ocean.

>onto the yacht.

Duo:  Man, I thought the fic would have ended for sure!

>"Please wait here while I go and get him." said one of the men.

>The man walked around to the other side of the captains area.

>"Please follow me." said one of the men standing next to Sakuya.

Tim:  Didn't they just tell her to wait?

>"Ok." said Sakuya as she followed him.

Mark:  Does nothing but follow the crowd, too.  Poor, clueless anime woman.

::Belldandy casts a look at Mark in response to the comment about anime women.::

Mark:  Okay!  Don't zap me!

>They headed around to the other side where the other guy had gone, 
>then Sakuya noticed a box with what looked like wet cement inside it.

>"What is that? It looks like cement." asked Sakuya.

Tim:  Yeah, we got a construction project going on out here.

>All of the sudden one of the men grabbed Sakuya and shoved her feet into
>the wet cement.

>"AHHHHHHH!!! what are you doing!!" screamed Sakuya.

>Then one of the guys stuck duct tape over her mouth.  Then all 3 of them
>pulled out their pistols and started shooting her in the legs, filling her
>legs with hot lead.

>"MMMPPPPPHHH" Sakuya screamed in pain.

>Blood poured from her legs, then one man grabbed a crowbar and started to
>beat her in the spine with it.  The sound of bones cracking could be heard
>very clearly.  Then they strapped a bomb to her that was set to detonate
>when her heartbeat slowed almost to stopping, but not quite.  They shot her 
>in the arms some more, then threw her into the ocean once the cement dried.  
>She sunk like a rock, screaming all the way down, she started losing oxygen
>quickly, and her blood filled the water, her heart slowed way down and then
>the bomb detonated filling  the water with blood and chunks of her body.
>Then extremely hungry sharks arrived and ate her remaining body parts.
>That was the end of Sakuya!!

Mark:  Now THAT...was a grueling death!

Tim:  ::Monty Python style.::  I've had worse.

Mark:  ::Follows suit.::  No you haven't!

Tim:  Just a scratch!

Mark:  Look!  You've got no body left!

Tim:  'Tis a flesh wound.

Mark:  Okay, let's quit.  An MSTer in another fic has already done Monty Python
and the Holy Grail before we did.  Let's drop it before they take action against
us.

Tim:  Okay.

>((YES AHAHHAHAHAHAAH!!! SAKUYA THE BITCH IS DEAD!!! HAHHHAHAHAHA) 
>- AAA-PhuckNut)

Duo:  Someone had a grudge.

____________________________________________________________________________


>Tenchi and Ryoko were married and lived happily ever after, having
>8 kids.

Keiichi:  SOMEONE was busy!

____________________________________________________________________________

>THE END

All:  YAY!!!!!!

Quatre:  Don't think it's over yet!  I've got more things planned for you!

All:  AW, MAN!

>Dont forget to join my chat room if ya want!!
>Just connect to a DAL.net server and join    #Ryoko
>See ya there!

Mark:  ::In a thug's voice.::  I know where you chat!

>Send all comments to:
>viperz00@winfire.com

Duo:  I will.

Quatre:  You just wait there and watch the fic in reruns until I figure out what
to do.

Tim:  NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

Keiichi:  Looks like that date's cancelled for a LONG time, Belldandy.  -_-;;

::Lemon begins to replay.  All of the MSTers sigh in distress.::

-------------------------------------------

That's all for our first MST.  Trust us, we'll get better.  Or we'll try, at least.
