    Tenchi awoke from his good nights sleep, but didnt see Ryoko anywhere
to greet him,

"Uh oh, Ryoko isnt around, I better be careful, she might try to ambush
me!" Tenchi said very nervously.

>Aniko: Holy God! Charlies!!
>Hiei: Ermm.. That was stupid..

    Tenchi cautiously got out of his bed and got dressed and slowly
headed out of his room,

"Oh god please, Oh god please, please dont let her jump me!" prayed
Tenchi.

>Gateu: I wouldn't want that either..
>Hiei: You wouldn't want a girl to sit on you and twist? My God.. there is
something severely wrong with you..

"Why cant these girls just figure it out already!  Cant they tell im not
interested in them?!  Im into MEN!!" Tenchi thought to himself.

>Washu: I had a feeling of that..
>Aniko: I knew it! I knew it!! It was either he was guy or he was VERY
stubborn.

    Tenchi went down to the kitchen, luckily avoiding Ryoko and Ayeka,
and was greeted by a smiling Sasami,

"Hi Tenchi! Good morning!" said Sasami.

"Oh hi Sasami, the food smells great, like always" said Tenchi.

>Aniko: Doesn't it always smell good? I mean.. You guys practically make
Sasami your slave.
>Washu: We do not!
>Gateu: I'm getting hungry..
>Hiei: You're always hungry!
>Gateu: I am not..
>Hiei: Hungry for guys.
>Gateu: Yea.. I mean no!

"I bet you cant wait for your birthday in just 5 days!!" Sasami said
happily.

"Oh ya! It will be fun!" said Tenchi.

>Aniko shudders: And him being gay, Jesus I wonder how that'll turn out..
>Washu: Aniko, stop making fun of him!
>Aniko: No! he deserves it for living with 6 or 7 girls and never did
anythign with 'em!

    The rest of the gang showed up for breakfast too.  And much to
Tenchi's dismay, Ryoko and Ayeka glomped all over him.

                                (5 days later)

>Aniko: That was quick.
>Hiei: He has author powers. He can do whatever he wants.
>Aniko: Wickey!!
>All look at Aniko: What??
>Aniko: It's my word.
>Washu: I'll have to tap into your head later and do some tests..
>Aniko: No!! Not the Magic fingers!! Well.. Hey I would like that, go ahead!
___________________________________________________________________________

    Tenchi woke up extra early because he was so excited that it was
his birthday today,

"Yes! Its my birthday!! WOOHOO!!" Tenchi cheered.

>Aniko: he's tunring how old? He acts like a 4 year old.. "Woohoo!" Grr..
>Washu: Leave him alone!! Before I turn you into a test subject!
>Aniko: I said you could.
>Washu: Fine then, I won't turn you into a test subject.
>Aniko: Fine I'll shut up..
>Gateu: Can I give hime a present?
>Hiei: No.. you can't..

    Just then Ryoko phased through the ceiling, totaly naked, and
landed on top of Tenchi,

"Oh Tenchi!! Happy birthday my sexy little man!!" Ryoko said seductivly.

>Aniko: That looks nice..
>Gateu: Yea it does..
>Hiei: She's hott..
>Gateu: Oops.. You guys were looking at her??
>Washu shudders and moves a few seats away: He's gross..

"Please Ryoko!! Not today!!" said Tenchi angrily.

"But Tenchi, why?  Dont you want me?!" pouted Ryoko.

>Aniko: Yea, is it 'cos your gay? Huh? Huh huh huh??
>Washu: Didn't I tell you you to leave him alone??
>Aniko: Oops...

"You know that I dont like it when you do this!! And plus todays
my birthday and the least you can do is, do what I ask!" Tenchi
said angrily.

>Hiei: Wow, even someone like him occasionally gets angry.. That's good to
know..
>Aniko: Didn't you say that somewhere before??
>Gateu: I wanna give Tenchi a present..

    Ryoko pouted then phased through the wall and headed towards
her room.

"If only Ryoko was a guy then things would be different!!" Tenchi thought
to himself happily.

>Aniko: Holy God!!
>Washu slapped Aniko across the face with a frying pan: Shut up!!
>Aniko laying on the ground: Oww.. Oww..
>Hiei: Of course.. the frying pan..

    Tenchi got dressed and headed downstairs for breakfast,

"Good morning Tenchi!!  I cooked your favorite because its your
birthday!!" Sasami beamed happily.

>Hiei: You mean salami??
>Gateu: Hey, that's my favorite food..
>Hiei looks at Gateu and scoots away: Jesus..
>Aniko moves away too: Gross..

"Oh thank you very much Sasami!" said Tenchi.

    Tenchi ate his breakfast very happily and went through the
rest of his day like usual, getting a "happy birthday!" from everyone.

>Aniko: Wasn't there supposed to be sex scenes in this?
>Hiei nodded: Yea.. But with Gateu here..
>Gateu sat alone: Now I can talk about how I love guys to myself!

_________________________________________________________________________

    Later on, around 6 p.m., everyone was gathered around inside the
living room,

"Happy birthday Tenchi!!" said everyone except Tenchi.

>Washu: Why haven't I been mentioned at ALL in this fic??
>Aniko: Maybe 'cos.. I dunno..

"Oh thank you guys very much!" said Tenchi.

>Gateu said seductively: You're welcome..

"I baked you a special chocolate cake!" Sasami said as she brought out
the cake.

"Thanks! I love chocolate cake!" Tenchi said.

>Hiei: Of course he likes chocolate cake.. because the inside of guys
 looks like Chocolate cake..
>Aniko: Dare I ask how you would now?
>Hiei: It's called deficating you idiot!

    Yosho lit the candles on the cake and they sung happy birthday
to Tenchi,

"Ok Tenchi!! make a wish!!" said Noboyuki.

>Aniko: You'll wish the girls left you alone?
>Hiei: That you could tell people you were gay?
>Gateu: I was there?
>Washu took a pan to everyone's face: Shut up all of you!

"I wish... I wish... I wish that all the girls in the house were
boys!!" Tenchi thought to himself.

>Hiei used his mind reading powers: Aha! I was right!
>Aniko looked at Hiei:When did you get mind reading powers? And maybe
 you wished that too..
>Hiei drew his katana: Shut your mouth Aniko..
>Aniko shuts up: K...

    Tenchi then blew out the candles and everyone cheered. Tenchi opened
all his gifts and they ate the cake.

>Aniko: That happened pretty quick..
>Rest of people move back to sit together again as Hiei says: So, did you
miss us, Gateu??
>Gateu: Ye- ermm.. no, I had a nice little conversationg with myself..
>Washu: Maybe I should use you as a test subject..
>Aniko: No!!! Make it ME!!! Gateu is gay, he wouldn't like that! BUT I
WOULD!!
>Washu again with the frying pan across Aniko's face: God.. calm down..
>Aniko on the ground: k..

"Thank you all for a wonderful birthday!" said Tenchi.

"No problem Tenchi!!" everyone except Tenchi said happily.

>Gateu: I wish I were there...
>Aniko: So you could screw Tenchi??
>Gateu: Stop picking on me about that!
>The rest stare blankly at the screen, pretending not to hear that: ......

    Tenchi then headed off for bed.  He fell asleep pretty quickly
and he had a wonderful dream about what his life would be like if
the girls were actually boys.

>Aniko: Jesus, I knew he was gay, but wow, this bad??

            ((and heres where the shit hits the fan!)) - AAA-PhuckNut

>Washu: He was never a character!
>Hiei: He's the fic writer, genius..
>Washu: Thank you!
>Hiei: That wasn't a compliment..

    Tenchi awoke from his wonderful dream, and was pretty sad that
it had to end,

"Man! that was such a good dream!" Tenchi said.

>Gateu: I bet it was.. I wanna join!!
>Hiei: Shut Up!!! You are a sick horny gay bastard Gateu!!
>Gateu with tears: But..
>Aniko and Washu: Yes, we know you like butts..

    Just then Ryoko phased through the ceiling and fell right onto
Tenchi,

"Ryoko Pl-" Tenchi said, but cut himself short when he noticed something
very different about her, her chest was flat and more muscular, her arms
were bulkier and her overall frame was bigger, and the most noticeable,
there was a giant bulge in her pants.  Ryoko wasnt a her!! Ryoko was a
HIM!!

>Hiei: Holy!!
>Aniko: And we said she looked good earlier!!
>Gateu's eyes light up: That's nice...

"Oh my god!! this cant be happening!! it must be a dream!!" thought Tenchi.

>Washu: I better not be a guy, I better not be a guy..
>Hiei: God let it be a dream, let it be a dream!!
>Gateu: I hope it isn't a dream, let it not be a dream!
>Aniko: Stop repeating yourselves!!!

"Oh Tenchi! I want you so bad!" said Ryoko.

>Washu with a shudder: Actually, she does want him, but this is a guy..

"Ryoko.. I.. I.. want you so badly too!!" screamed Tenchi very happily.

>Hiei: This is starting to get pretty gross..
>Aniko: Here's where the sex comes in..

    Tenchi then got a huge erection as Ryoko pulled down his pants
revealing his huge cock.

>All scream and cover eyes but Gateu: Oh God!!
>Gateu wide eyed: Salami!!! Oh Boy tht is great!!
>Aniko and Hiei turn around and face away from the screen and start there
own
conversation: So
how many eps are in your YYH series??
>Hiei: I think like.. 115..
>Aniko: Kool..
>Washu: Wow.. that is really big..

"Your so big Ryoko! I love you so much!!" said Tenchi.

"I love you too Tenchi!" said Ryoko very gleefully.

    Tenchi then took his pants off and slid his penis into
Ryoko's manly asshole and started to bounce him up and down on his
penis.

>Washu turns away and joins the convo with Hiei and Aniko: That's some gross
stuff.
>Aniko: We know..
>Gateu watches, his face beaming: I have got to try that...

"OH YES RYOKO!! Your ass is so firm and muscular!!" screamed Tenchi.

    Just then Ayeka burst into the room.  Ayeka had all the features
of a valiant prince, and a big schlong to boot!

"HOW DARE YOU HAVE SEX WITH TENCHI WITHOUT ME!!" screamed Ayeka.

>Aniko: Did Ayeka just say that??
>Washu: I think so..
>Hiei: I'm gonna be sick..
>Gateu: This is great!! Why aren't you guys watching?

"Calm down! just come and join us!!" said Tenchi and Ryoko.

>Gateu: I wish I could!!

    Ayeka then got on top of Tenchi in a 69 form and stuck his penis
into Tenchi's mouth and started to suck on Ryoko's penis.

>Gateu pulled out a notebook and pen, writing things down: Gotta try that
too
>Hiei gets sick on the ground, he then runs to the bathrooms: Oh God!!
>Aniko: Ewwie..

"OH YESSSSSS!!!!!" screamed all 3 of them.

    They all came at the same time, filling each other with their
sperm.

>Washu: Gross shit!!
>Aniko's eyes widened in horror: Holy shit...
>Hiei turned kinda pale: Thats some scary shit is what it is..
>Gateu smiled slightly: That's some nice shit!!

"Ok, lets try something different!" said Tenchi.

>Aniko: No please, don't!!
>Washu: That phucknut guy wasn't kidding, this is where shit hits
the fan..

"Ok!" said Ryoko and Ayeka.

    Tenchi then got on his hands and knees and Ayeka got on top
of Tenchi and shoved his penis into Tenchi's tight teenaged ass.
Ryoko then got on top of Ayeka and stuck his cock into Ayeka's
anus.

"Ok here we go!" said Tenchi.

>Hiei: NO!!!!
>Gateu: Yes!!

    Then they started their little orgy.

>Washu: Please don't let me be in this!!!
>Aniko gets up and walks out: I don't think I want to MST this
anymore!!
>Hiei runs over to Aniko: Wait!! I'm coming too man!!
>Washu folows: That is a freaky fic...
>Gateu leaves as well: I don't like being alone.. I'll come too..

"Oh Ryoko! I love it when you put your giant cock in my ass!" said
Ayeka.

"Prince Ayeka! your asshole is so tight!" said Ryoko.

    Then Yosho walked into the room and instantly wanted to get in
on the action.

"Tenchi! May I join in please?" asked Yosho.

"Of course grandpa!" beamed Tenchi.

"Come here and stick your old johnson right into my mouth!" said Tenchi.

    Yosho then nodded his head and walked over to Tenchi.  Then Yosho
removed his robe and stuck his wrinkled penis into Tenchi's moist mouth.

"MMMMM Tenchi!! You are so good at giving blow-jobs!" said Yosho.

    Yosho then dropped his 'hot pocket' into Tenchi's mouth, who
swallowed very happily.

"mmmm, very delicious grandfather." Tenchi said.

"Why thank you Tenchi." Yosho said.

    Just then Noboyuki walked in........

________________________________________________________________________

    Noboyuki woke up terrified, he was sweating all over.

"OH MY GOD!! oh.. whew.. it was just a dream." said Noboyuki sounding
very relieved.

    Noboyuki looked at his clock and it said it was 3:00 p.m.

"Funny.. I dont remember falling asleep after I woke up this morning.."
said Noboyuki.

"Well, Tenchi should be home soon from school, so I'll go meet him at the
door." Noboyuki said as he headed for the front door.

    5 minutes later Tenchi came walking in,

"Hey dad Im home!" yelled Tenchi.

    Noboyuki came walking around the corner and greeted his son,

"Hey Tenchi, you have a good day at school today?" Noboyuki asked.

"Ya dad, I got something to tell you." said Tenchi.

"Sure go ahead and tell away." said Noboyuki.

"I had sex with my science teacher today!" said Tenchi.

"Yes!! hes not gay!! it was just a dream and this proves it!!" Noboyuki
thought to himself.

"THATS GREAT SON!! Your finally becoming a man!!" beamed a proud
Noboyuki as he patted Tenchi on the shoulders.

"So you gonna go back tonight and get some more? eh?" asked Noboyuki as
he winked his eye.

"Nah, his penis was too big, ill need to give my ass a day to heal." said
Tenchi.

"............." was all Noboyuki was able to do.....
