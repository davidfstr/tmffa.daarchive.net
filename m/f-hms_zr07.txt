*DISCLAIMER*
I maintain that I actually came up with all of the characters 
represented within this MST, except for the crappy original ones in
the fics themselves.  The MSTers, however, were originally thought 
up by me in a small cave on an island in the south Pacific, so I own
them all!  However, until I can find my documented evidence that Toei
Animation and Saban, Gainax, Sunrise and Sotsu Agency, and Pioneer
and AIC stole my ideas for Ken and Wormon, Misato, Duo, and Kiyone,
respectively, I'll just hedge my bets and say that they're the actual
owners.  I'll see you all in court, you thieving bastards! 
*DISCLAIMER*

The HMS Zap Rowsdower.  A former experimental Canadian spacecraft, 
stolen by an unwitting teenage tourist, Cyrus Marriner.  It is on 
this newly acquired spaceship that this young man dedicates himself 
to one sole purpose...to make the universe a better place.  To boldly 
seek out evil in all of its forms and destroy it with extreme 
prejudice.  Unfortunately, he really doesn't have the time to do
all of that, and the ship is really complicated, so he just decides 
to make fun of really bad Tenchi Muyo fan fiction.

Using advanced Canadian technology, Cyrus Marriner reaches into
the fabric of time and space and pulls together a crew of individuals 
who can handle the severe mental strain of reading bad fan fiction.  
Unless they can't.

And now, for the introductions!

"Hot and Moist" Kiyone Makibi
"Sudsy and Sexy" Duo Maxwell
"Too Goddamn Young" Ken Ichijouji
"Wet and Wild" Misato Katsuragi

And Featuring...

"The Slippery Worm" Wormon

_____________________________________________________________________

And now, what you've all been waiting for...
THE OBLIGATORY HOT SPRINGS EPISODE!

	It was yet another beautiful day on the HMS Zap Rowsdower.  
Well, the florescent lights were certainly beautiful.  As beautiful
as artificially produced light from burning gases can be.  And
as was often dictated by the beauty of beautiful days, it was time
for everybody to hop into the hot springs.
	Of course, the hot springs were divided by gender, so as to
prevent Duo and Cyrus from dying of massive blood loss.  But to 
balance out this injustice to male hormones, the hot springs were 
both close to each other, and separated only by a tiny fence.  
Because why in the hell would you have hot springs if they didn't 
set up wacky hijinks involving peeping?  Duh.
	Of course, our current scene is set in the women's springs,
because let's be honest, nobody wants Wormon fanservice.  They want
to see the succulent breasts of our two remarkably beautiful female
characters floating on the top of the water, like two buoyant...
	Ahem.  Sorry, got sidetracked.  Anyway, Misato and Kiyone were
both relaxing in the warm water, seated across from each other.
Misato was drinking a cold beer, while Kiyone was treating herself to
the occasional drink of sake.  Mmm...drunk...wet...Kiyone...Misato...
	SORRY!  Lost my train of thought again.  I think there's some
dialogue coming up here somewhere.  Oh, yes, here it is:
	"So, why do you think Cyrus told us about these hot springs?"
asked Kiyone.
	"One of two reasons," theorized Misato.  "One, he's trying to
relax us before he gives us bad news.  Two, he wants to check out 
our racks."
	"No I don't!" came Cyrus's voice from the low fence separating
the two springs.
	"Shut up, idiot!" Duo hissed, but it was too late.  He was
quickly hit in the forehead with a rock, knocking him back from his
vantage point at the fence.
	"Ha ha--OW!"  Cyrus's laughter was quickly cut off as another
rock beaned him right on the noggin, giving him a chance to use that
phrase. 
	"There we go," said Misato as she relaxed into the water.
	"Mmmm...this does feel good.  So good, in fact, that I'm going
to neglect asking how there is a hot springs on a spaceship, as well
as why ."  Kiyone took a sip of sake, and sunk into the water until 
she was submerged up to the bottom of her chin.
	Suddenly, an evil grin crossed Misato's visage.  "I just had a
very evil idea," she said, turning to Kiyone.
	"Yes?" said Kiyone, as she was always a fan of evil ideas.
	Misato moved over next to Kiyone and began whispering in her
ear.  Slowly Kiyone's grin grew as Misato outlined her plan.

	The men's hot spring was decidedly less sexy than the women's.
Much of this had to do with the fact that Wormon was there.  Wormon
was definitely not sexy.
	Anyway, Duo and Cyrus were rubbing their swollen heads (NO!
Not THOSE swollen heads, you pervert!) while Ken sat in the corner
reading a book.  Wormon was busy swimming, a bizarre sight that
could not be adequately described by someone too lazy to.
	However, the quiet serenity that was the relaxation of the hot
springs was broken by a loud cry from Misato.  But not one of pain.  
One of ecstasy.  Specifically, it went like this:
	"OOOOHHHHH GOD YESSSSS!!!  KIIIYYYOOOOONEEE!  OOOHHH, IT FEELS
SO GOOD!  DON'T STOP!  DON'T STOP!  YEEEEESSSS!!!  I LOVE YOU!!!"
	Duo and Cyrus looked towards the sound for all of two seconds
before clambering up the rocks at the edge of the hot spring to look
over the fence.
	Cyrus was the first up, and the first to see a sight he would
certainly remember: Misato wearing a towel standing at the edge of 
the hot spring, smirking at him.  It would be ingrained in his mind 
for a while, in much the same way the words "Louisville Slugger" 
would be imprinted on his forehead.
	Duo had no time to worry about his companion's baseball-bat
induced fate, as his only concern was seeing the hot, hot sex.  He
soon met a fate similar to his perverted compatriot's.

	Cyrus was woken up a while later by the sound of the alarm 
signifying a fanfic starting.  Looking around, he discovered two
things.  One, he was naked and in the bathroom, and two, he was
completely hairless, except for his head and face.  Fortunately,
the girls had found mercy in their hearts and decided to let him
keep his beard and hair.
	But that wasn't the primary thing he was concerned with at the
moment.  The fanfic alert was going on!  That meant it was time to
MST, and MSTing was his solemn duty.  So he heroically found a robe,
wrapped it around himself, and ran out of the bathroom to the
theater.
	He was a dedicated MSTer, after all.  And nothing, be it rain,
sleet, hail, snow, or hairlessness, would keep him from his work.

<Kiyone>: Geez, what took you so long?
<Cyrus>: Oh, come on.  I was unconscious.  And shaved, I noticed.
<Misato>: *laughs* Oh, we got you good, Cyrus.
<Cyrus>: Where's Duo?
<Kiyone>: Oh, he met a similar fate.
(Duo enters at that moment.)
<Duo>: Being set on fire is NOT a "similar fate".
<Misato>: Oh, look on the bright side.  At least you managed to 
put out the fire before it got really bad.  And the skin grafts look
good on you!
<Ken>: I suppose we should be quiet, what with the MST starting and
all.

I don't own anything so if anyone sues me, I'll kick your ass!
just joking , enjoy!

<Duo>: Yeah, I doubt you could kick any of our asses.  Even
Wormon's.
<Wormon, from the Bridge>: Hey, I heard that!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Gene Mesaki Saga Part III

<Cyrus>: Let's recap the previous two stories for the benefit
of the crew member who hasn't seen them, shall we?
<Ken>: Certainly.  In the first story, Tenchi's brother,
"Gene" comes back to the household after his boxing career.
<Duo>: Then he nails Kiyone.
<Kiyone>: You didn't have to mention that.
<Duo>: Come on, how else are the readers going to understand
Gene's evolution as a character?
<Ken>: Anyway, the next day he goes shopping with Sasami,
and the author seems to get a big laugh out of making it
seem like Gene--
<Cyrus>: --who everybody assumes is an SI character--
<Ken>: --is a pedophile.
<Duo>: Then he nails Washu.
<Cyrus>: Make sense, Misato?
<Misato>: Please, can I get really drunk before we read this?
<Cyrus>: No.  Lucidity is necessary for the MST.  You get
drunk after.
<Misato>: Slavedriver.

                        "Truth hurts or does it?"

<Duo>: No, it doesn't.  What Gene did to Kiyone in the 
first episode, however...
<Kiyone>: Yeah, well what about that one misadventure you
had with Heero?
<Duo>: Ack.
<Kiyone>: How's your truth hurt now, bitch?

                                      By
                                Mr. Sinister

There where many clouds in the sky. Rain was dropping
from every direction. 

<Ken>: That's odd.  Most rain tends to take a direct path
to the ground, with its direction changing based on the
wind.
<Cyrus>: You have to remember, Ken.  Mr. Sinister is a
dumbass.  And what have I taught you about dumbasses?
<Ken>: That there are three of them on the crew and Duo
is two of them?
<Duo>: Hey!

It was 10 am but it was a dark day. Winds coming in and 
not a single ray of pure sun shine.

<Misato>: Dammit, I knew that Sun-Drop was going too far!

Gene awoke in his bed and looked out side his window.
"What did I do to her? What is it doing to me?" 

<Kiyone>: The fic?  Oh, it's raping you and Washu.  And us,
too!

Gene said to himself quietly. He woke up and put on a 
pair of shorts and a undershirt. 

<Cyrus>: Ugh!  Man-boobs!

Then he ran towards the bathroom, he kneeled in front of 
the toilet and started to throw up. 

<Duo>: Maybe all of our theories about Gene's appearance
are wrong.  He's behaving like a supermodel.

He flushed and then he cleaned himself. He took 2
showers that day and he brushed his teeth 3 times. "I'm
so dirty, must get clean" He said to himself a bunch of
times.

<Misato>: So our beloved hero has obsessive-compulsive
disorder?  Guys, should I be feeling something now?
<Everyone Else>: No.

Then he walked out of the bathroom and he saw Sesami
standing there. "Hello Gene, I heard some noises so I
thought I would come and check on you" She said as
she smiled and tilted her head to the side.

<Duo, as Sasami>: I thought you were jacking off again,
and I came on behalf of the family to tell you that ten
times a day is more than enough.

"Thanks Sesami. But I think I might be coming down with
something. I'll go and ask Washu for help" Gene replied to
her.

"Oh ok Gene well I hope you get better soon. 

<Kiyone>: If he's going to Washu, I really doubt it.

I made a special breakfast today" She bowed down and 
walked back to the kitchen.

<Misato, as Sasami>: Actually, your breakfast is particularly
special.  Oh, it's supposed to taste like bitter almonds, too.

Gene went towards the door of Washus laboratory. He
grabbed the knob with his right hand and paused. He stared
at the door and said "Will she forgive me? 

<Cyrus>: For ass-raping her?  Oh, I'm sure she'll be
chock-full of forgiveness.

She is one of my last resorts" 

<Misato>: Did he try any other resorts other than the
obsessive-compulsive stuff he did in the bathroom?

He said a little prayer to himself and he held his
breath. He opened the door and walked in.

<Kiyone>: And was beheaded.  The end.

He looked around and saw a  very peaceful place. There
where water falls around and he saw Washu on her holo
computer. He looked at the screen above her head and
he saw a picture of himself. 

<Cyrus>: Dammit, Washu's over at www.ugly.com again.

There was a birds eye picture and side picture and a 
picture from the front.

<Ken>: How exactly would a bird's eye view help her make
any sort of medical judgment?  I can't recall ever going
off to the doctor's and having them take X-Rays from a
helicopter.

"What are you Gene?" Washu said. She didn't even take
her eyes of her holo comp. She just kept on typing.

<Cyrus, as Gene>: Well, I like to think of myself as pure
ham.

"I don't know but whatever it is, it's taking me over" He
replied. Then he walked towards her and stood next to
her. "I'm sorry about last night. If this thing wasn't in me
then I wouldn't have done anything to you last night"

<Duo>: You know, I'll have to write that down.  "Rape girl,
act insane, live happily ever after."

She stopped and looked at him " Don't worry about
it Gene. Maybe next time you can be a little less rough
on me"

<Kiyone>: Oh, there's that Mr. Sinister wit!  Ha ha!
<Misato>: Remember, boys and girls, be sure to always
carry a healthy sense of sarcasm with you.

"Say whaa" He said as he raised one eyebrow and looked
at Washu in amazement.

"Gene I think I figured out what your virus is" Washu said as
the quickly changed the subject. Then she became very serious.
"Have you ever heard of Vampires, Ghouls, Angels and Devils?"

<Ken>: Yes.  Can anybody here not see where this is going?
(Duo raises his hand)  Besides Duo?

"Well yeah obviously. But do you mean that people have seen
them in real life?" Gene said as he got really confused. Then
he started to scratch his head. But he knew his real secret.

<All>: The fuck? (Everybody looks at each other.) Did you
understand that?  No.  I didn't think so.  (Eerie silence
as everyone realizes they just spoke in unison.)

"You see since the start of time on this world. There has been
a virus that changes people. Normal evolution is from when
your kind. The humans evolved from monkey to what you
see on television. 

<Cyrus>: Not in Kansas, they didn't.

But this virus changes that. Vampires, Ghouls Devils and so on 
are causes of this virus." 

<Misato>: So this virus is caused by White Wolf Role-Playing 
Games?

Washu said as she showed Gene newspaper articles of people 
seeing monsters.

(A loud snapping sound is heard)
<Kiyone>: What was that?
<Cyrus>: Oh that was our suspension of disbelief being stretched
to the point of breaking.
<Ken>: Yeah, why the hell would Washu keep newspaper clippings, 
exactly?

"Hmm I think I know what you mean. Like there is a virus
that makes people into monsters?" Gene said still scratching his
head. "But I don't get anything at all"

<Duo>: Actually, in this fic, you've been getting quite a bit,
if you know what I mean.

"Don't worry about it Gene. Just go stand there" Washu said
as she shook her head to the amazement of Gene stupidity.

<Cyrus>: Wow, it took her this long to do that?  We must be
smarter than Washu!

"Ehh ok" Gene said. Then he walked over to a golden
star on the ground "I just don't want any anal
prooooooobbbbbeeeeeeessssss"

<Misato, as Washu>: Oh, you'll get plenty of those when
you go to jail.

He got cut off as these metal tentacles wrapped around
his ankles, waist and wrists. Then a black table appeared
and Gene got strapped to the table.

"Sorry little Washu but I don't play this way" Gene said
to Washu as sweat was dropping down his face.

<Duo, as Gene>: Yeah, I mean, you're a *girl*!  Icky!

"Don't worry Gene. But there is one thing" She said

<Kiyone, as Washu>: I'm afraid I'll have to use the probe
I nicknamed "Big Bertha".

"Ehh what's that?!" He replied.

"This is really going to hurt, and I'm sorry Gene" She said
as a tear came down her left cheek.

<Ken>: She's only sad because she has to waste a "Big Bertha"
on him.

*Holy this girl has feeling for me or maybe its a tear of joy
for getting me back for last night* Gene thought to himself.

<Duo>: Here's hoping it's a tear of joy.

All these machines came out of the ground. They where all
little black boxes. The first one opened up and a robotic hand
came out with a needle at the tip of each finger. Then the other
black metal boxes hovered closer towards Gene. Each one
had a multiple number of silver metal mini tentacles come out
of it.

<Cyrus>: Ugh, the mini-tentacle-rape scene.
<Kiyone>: Little tentacles for little guys.

In the living room. Every one sat around the table. "Where's
Gene?" Tenchi said as he looked at Sesami.

<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: Is he gone?  Please tell me he's gone!

"I don't know but I made him a special breakfast as a thank
you for the trip to the mall." She looked at Tenchi and
frowned.

<Misato, as Sasami>: It's chock full of poison-y goodness!

Back in the lab. The box with the needles started to inject
Gene with some kind of green liquid. Then they took blood
from Gene. 

<Ken>: So Washu's replacing his blood with lime Jell-O?
Is this supposed to prove something?

On of the boxes was in front of Gene and then 2 mini tentacles 
went towards his temples. On the tip there where drills. They 
drilled into Genes temples.

<Kiyone>: And into his brain, killing him instantly.  The end.

He started to scream out in pain.

"NOOOOOO STOPPPP - THIIISSS WASHUUUUU"
Gene said as he screamed louder and louder.

<Duo>: So is Washu testing the effects of pain on losers,
or something?

Then all the other boxes started drilling into him. Some
where in his kidneys, behind his knees, in his elbows,
mostly everywhere around his body. 

<Kiyone>: What the hell?  I'm starting to enjoy this fic!
<Misato>: That's because the amount of pain the crappy SI
character is in is inversely proportional to the amount of
pain the readers are in.  Suzuki's Theorem.
<Kiyone>: What the hell?  Do you do reading beforehand?

Blood ran down his face. He screamed louder and louder. The 
sides of his mouth started to rip as he screamed. The louder 
he screamed the louder it would have torn.

<Ken>: Well, we're all getting to see Gene getting tortured
to death, and yet I feel strangely unfulfilled.
<Cyrus>: Probably because this is part three of four.  At
least, so far.

Then the boxes started to gather energy and they started
to shock him. He screamed louder and louder.

<Duo>: So, what exactly does this experiment prove?
<Cyrus>: I guess that the author knows the character sucks.

"What's going on?" Tenchi said as he listened to the screams
of his brother. "Is that..?"

"Its Gene!" Mihoshi said.

<Misato, as Mihoshi>: I hope he dies and shuts up soon!

The group gathered around the laboratory door.

"I have to get in there. What's Washu doing to him"
Tenchi said as he tried to opened to door. "It's locked"

<Cyrus>: Good.

"I can do it" Ryoko said as she tried to open the door.
"Its too tight" Then she threw energy balls at the door and
it still didn't open.

"All we can do is listen" Kyone said.

<Kiyone>: And good listening it is indeed!

Everyone looked at each other and no one knew what to
do. Then Sesami started to cry and Tenchi started to
comfort her as he tightly hugged her. Aeka tried to help
out Sesami too.

<Misato, as Sasami>: What if Washu doesn't stop until he's
dead?
<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: Don't worry, Sasami.  It's Washu.  She
does the job right.

"AGHHH ILL KILL YOU FOR THIS WASHU!" Gene
screamed in his evil voice. * Can't carry on* He thought.

"Gene this is for your own good. I'm trying to kill the virus
with in you" Washu said with a worried look on he face.

<Ken>: I guess the way she figures it, if he's dead, then so
is the virus.  A medical theory I'm all for.

Gene screamed louder and louder. His cheeks had been
ripped into 2 and blood came from everywhere his body.
His skin was turning into red it wasn't his blood but it was
the same color. 

<Kiyone>: It probably is blood.  I mean, if it looks like a duck
quacks like a duck...

Washu stood there in shock. She made here holo comp come back 
up. Then she tried to tighten the restrains on him.

He screamed again. But the tone of his voice darkened
and it didn't sounds like his normal happy voice. His eyeballs
turned black and his eyes turned into blood red.

<Cyrus>: So he's evil.  Thanks for pointing that out, Mr.
Sinister!

Washu looked at Gene and she couldn't believe it. She saw
2 cracks in his forehead 

<Cyrus>: What a butthead.

and 2 horns grew out of his forehead.

<Misato>: Honk if you're horny, baby.

His size grew bigger and taller. His shirt ripped as his muscles
got bigger and tightened. Then his nails turned black and they
grew longer and sharpened at the tips. She even saw a tail
growing out behind Gene.

<Duo>: I bet it's a bunny rabbit tail.

She didn't want to be around while Gene broke free. She
quickly ran towards the door and opened it. Gene started
to move back and forth and then he tore the machines apart
and he broke free. 

<Cyrus, as Dubbed Guy>: Help us!  The monster is going
to attack Tokyo!
<Ken, as Dubbed Guy>: Wait!  Gamera will save us!

He ripped out all the mini tentacles and he destroyed all 
the boxes. Then his body started to heal himself.  All the 
cuts and scars started to disappear.

<Kiyone>: Man, this sucks.  It's starting to be painful
again.
<Misato>: I told you, the Suzuki Theorem...

Washu ran into the living room and she saw all the people
listening.

"WASHU What did you do to Gene?" Tenchi quickly said.

<Misato, as Washu>: I was trying to kill him, but the author
must have had some sort of shitty plot device just in case
something like this happened!

"I don't know, but my experiment went wrong, I must have
miscalculated something, but there is no time we have to go
outside now before he gets to us." Washu said as he hurried
outside.

<Cyrus>: Woah, is Washu a hermaphrodite?
<Duo>: It would explain why Gene slept with her.  I mean,
him.

So Tenchi, Aeka, Mihoshi, Kyone, Sesami, Washu, Ryoko,
Ryo-ohki and Nobuyuki ran outside beside the lake.

"So what happened Washu?" Tenchi said as he was gasping
for air.

<Kiyone>: Geez, you puss.  It's only a thirty or so yard
sprint.

"He transformed" Washu said. Then she looked inside the
from a distance.

Gene got to the door but it was locked. He let out a loud
growl that send shivers down all the girls spines. Then
they heard banging on the door.

<Cyrus>: Little pig, little pig, let me in!

BOOM BOOM BOOM Then the door broke free.

"Tenchi I'm scared" Sesami said as she hugged his left leg.

"Don't worry Sesami, Gene wont hurt us" Tenchi said
as he picked her up and hugged her.

<Duo, as Gene>: The hell I won't!  Get over here so this
author can finally write a Sasami lemon!

"Yes but I don't think that, that think is Gene" Washu
said.

Gene started to walk out the lab door dragging his tail behind
him. He looked to his right and he saw the group stand there.
He quickly started to walk outside.

<Ken>: Wow.  They really don't understand the concept of "running",
do they?

"HEEE I MEAN IT'S COMMING" Aeka said as she
made a shield around the group. "I will protect you
Lord Tenchi"

Ryoko looked at Aeka in jealousy so she said "I'll kill
him now" She powered up and started to fly.

<Kiyone>: Powered up?  She's not a robot, dumbass.  Nor
is she a Dragonball Z character.

"NOOO don't Ryoko. Gene is in there." Tenchi said in
a worried look. He took a deep breath then he said
"Do what you can, but don't kill him. Make it your last
resort" He shook his head and he couldn't believe what
he just said.

<Misato, as Ryoko>: Right.  Make him suffer, first.

Ryoko looked at his worried face and said "Don't worry
Tenchi it wont come to that" She turned around and
saw Gene standing at the house which is like 50 feet
away from them.

<Duo>: I love this writing style Mr. Sinister is using.
<Cyrus, as Author>: You see he was, like, 50 feet away,
and then he, like, walked over to them, and he was, like
20 feet away...
<Duo>: Totally.

He started to clap and he said "That was truly
heartbreaking, now its time to kill you all." He leaned
forward and started to charge.

<Cyrus, like a bugle>: Da da da da, da daaaaa! (Thrusts his
fist into the air, accompanied by silence.  A cricket chirps.)
You're supposed to say cha--
<Kiyone>: We know.  Just shut up.

The girls all charged up and got ready for his attack.
Mihoshi and Kyone got their lazer guns and aimed.
Aeka made her shield powerfuller. 

<Ken>: Did she make it more powerfuller?  Be cause then
it would have been really powerful!

She summoned her guardians and they helped out. Washu was 
still on her holo comp and Ryoko made a energy ball.

<Cyrus>: Holy shit!  This author actually remembered Azaka
and Kamidake!  Not their names, of course, but he remembered
they existed.  Maybe we should give him a break.

Gene got closer and closer he was 20 feet away then
15- 10 -5 then he stopped. He felt something right next
to his neck. It was the blue light sword. Which looks and
sounds exactly like the light saber. 

<Kiyone>: You know, Pioneer might not be up for suing a lot
of people, but I bet George Lucas would be up to it.
<Cyrus>: Yeah, he's probably got a big chunk of time he had
set aside for reading letters praising the title of his
latest Star Wars movie.  Attack of the Clones, my ass.
<Duo>: This bit of Star Wars bitchery was brought to you
by Ed Wood.  Remember, even Ed Wood wouldn't give his movie
a stupid name like "Attack of the Clones"!
<Kiyone>: Uh, Ed Wood's been dead for years.  How can he be
a sponsor?
<Duo>: Through the magic of science.
<Kiyone>: But...
<Duo>: Shhhhh.

He looked to see who held the sword at his neck "Well 
hello there grand father, how are you today?" He said to 
Yosho as he smiled.

<Cyrus, as Yosho>: Well, I'm doing okay, and I...hey!  I'm
supposed to be kicking your ass!
<Duo>: That crafty Gene.  What won't he try?

"I felt there was a evil power but I can't believe that its
you Gene" Yosho said to Gene. But he wasn't the old
Yosho he was the younger form, the powerful one.

<Misato>: Yeah, lemme guess, this feeling started around the
time Gene arrived and disappear whenever Gene would leave.
Great deduction, Sherlock!

"Look Gene is gone, I'm his evil side. Ever since he was
a kid there was a great evil growing inside him. That evil
is me. Also its not just the virus that made him like this..."

<Cyrus>: ...it's the cream-soda flavored gelatin.

Gene said then he quickly jumped back 5 feet and jumped
towards Yosho for an attack.

Yosho flipped backwards and he charged towards Gene.
Yosho aimed towards Genes head. But Gene knew what
he was up to so he moved his head to the right and then he
digged and cut into the side of Yoshos stomach.

<Ken>: This is some of the worst choreography I have ever
seen.  And I was on Digimon.

After their attack they finished their jump and landed behind
each other at a distance of 10 feet.

Genes tail was moving from side to side. He looked over
his right shoulder. He looked at the back of Yosho and said.
"I know all your moves, there is nothing you can to do beat
me, you trained me too well." 

<Kiyone>: Maybe you don't remember, Mr. Sinister, but you
established in the first chapter that Gene had been away
for most of his adult life.  I hardly think Yosho would
be able to teach an eight-year-old a lifetime of swordfighting.

He looked down at his left hand and saw Yoshos blood dripping 
of his nails onto the grass.

"I didn't teach you everything" Yosho said as he fell to the
grass.

<Cyrus, as Yosho>: Hell, I didn't teach you anything!

"Dad" Nobuyuki said as he rushed to Yosho and lifted him.
He picked up the light sword and threw it to Tenchi for
safety. He put Yosho over his left shoulder and he ran inside.

<Duo>: And Gene just stood there watching, huh?

Tenchi put Sesami down and he picked up the swords and he
powered it up. "WHAT EVER YOU ARE, I WONT LET YOU TAKE GENE" 
Tenchi yelled.

<Ken, as Tenchi>: I have to get my beating in, first!

"What are you talking about Tenchi I could never hurt you"
Gene said as he looked at Tenchi.

"Stop Tenchi I'll go first" Ryoko said as she charged
Gene.

<Misato>: Gee, I thought Ryoko was fine with being
second.  Oh, wait, that was with something else.

"We all will" Kyone said. Then everyone except Sesami and
Washu surrounded Gene.

<Kiyone>: What the hell?  Are they going to play duck duck
goose or something?

"Ha this is a joke." Gene looked around and he charged
towards Kyone. 

<Cyrus>: No, this is a joke.  Knock, knock.
<Kiyone>: Shut up.

She tried to shoot him but she missed several times. He jumped 
side to side, and he dodged all her blasts. He got close to her 
pulled his right hand, clinched his fist and hit Kyone in the 
stomach. He looked her in the eyes and he watched Kyone spit out 
blood and run down her face onto her chin. 

<Ken>: Wait, is Kiyone running down her own face?  Maybe you
should worry more about your antecedents, Mr. Sinister.

He took his hand away from her stomach and he put his hand on 
her neck. He held her up. He leaned forward and stuck out his 
tongue trying to lick her blood.

<Duo>: See, this is why you should wear a cross like Misato
does, Kiyone.  It keeps evil demons away.
<Kiyone, muttering>: I tried, but you still hit on me, anyway.

He got closer and closer. Then he got shot in the back.
"AGHH" He dropped Kyone and turned around. He said
"All right who did that?" He looked around and saw Mihoshi
with her knees wobbling and smoke coming out of he gun.

<Misato>: Well, it couldn't have been her, her gun shoots smoke,
not "lazers".

She had 2 tears on the side of her face. "Stay back!" She said
"You - you are under arrest for abusing a Galaxy Police
Officer"

"Yeah right like I will come in peace" Gene replied. 

<Cyrus>: Looks like somebody's figured out how to use sarcasm!
Oooh, we're so scared!

He started to fly towards Mihoshi. He suddenly hit a 
little hovering log. "What's this?" 

<Duo, as Gene>: Can I lick blood off of it?

He looked around and he saw that he was surrounded by 
these mini logs. He couldn't move around. "What kind of 
trick is this? I CAN'T MOVE" He said as he got angrier.

<Misato, as Ayeka>: Thank you, thank you.  For my next
trick, I'll make all of the sanity in this story disappear!

It was Aeka special holding shield. She combined her
powers with her guardians. Then Gene looked to his left
and saw Ryoko and Tenchi charging towards him.

<Cyrus, as a bugle>: Da da da da, da daaaa! (Thrusts his
fist into the air again.  Again, there is silence.)  I
suppose the chances didn't going to get any better you guys
were going to go along with it and say "Charge!", huh?
<Kiyone>: Good guess.

Tenchi was able to cut Gene in the front of his chest and
Ryoko cut Gene in his lower back. Gene let out a giant
scream. He was able to make a energy ball out of his hand
and the made it hit Aeka.

<Ken>: He made an energy ball out of his hand?  So, his
hand became an energy ball, and then he made it hit Ayeka.
Anyone care to wrap their brain around that?

"Aeka" Tenchi yelled as she flew backwards and she hit the
ground. The ball hit her in the stomach and winded her. She
blacked out.

<Cyrus>: What, you mean like half of California at any given
time?

Since Aeka blacked out, the power of the force field was taken
out. Gene flew towards the guardians, and he cut the guardian
logs into little pieces.

<Kiyone>: Cyrus, are you okay?
<Cyrus>: Did you see that?  Did you?
<Kiyone>: See what?
<Cyrus>: The bullshit that he just pulled.  Did you see what
happened to Azaka and Kamidake?  That is such complete bullshit.
I'm going to kill this author.  If there's one thing you don't
do, it's come up into my house--
<Ken>: You mean spaceship.
<Cyrus>: --spaceship, and screw around with Azaka and Kamidake.
You JUST DON'T DO IT.
<Kiyone>: Stop it, you're scaring me.

Gene looked at Ryoko and he liked his lips. 

<Misato>: I agree.  They're a nice pair of lips.  I can see why 
he'd like them.  And Duo, if you say anything, I'm pretty sure 
Kiyone will kill you.
<Duo>: Dammit.

Then he flew towards her and he was just about to attack Ryoko 
and slice her into little pieces. But just before he attacked 
Sesami got in the way and he cut hit her in the in the chest. 

<Cyrus>: Oh, Ryoko, Sasami'll take a hit for her, but Azaka and
Kamidake...
<Kiyone>: Come on, Cyrus, aren't you taking this a bit too
seriously?
<Cyrus>: WHY THE HELL ARE YOU DEFENDING THE LITTLE BITCH?  WHAT
THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?
<Kiyone>: Uh, anybody got some sort of antipsychotic on them?

On her left side over her heart.

"Noooooo" Gene screamed. as he fell to the floor and he took
his hand out of Sesami. He wrapped his hands around her.
"Sesami please don't die, I'm sorry"

<Ken>: Yeah, I'm sure she wouldn't have been mad at you for
killing Ryoko.
<Cyrus>: Yeah, and you killed AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE!  YOU BASTARD!
I'LL KILL YOU!  I'LL KILL YOU ALL!

Tenchi looked at Sesames dying body. 

<Duo, singing>: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to
Sesame's Dying Body?

His eyes opened wide and he charged at Gene. He held his sword 
back and then he cut of Genes head. His head flew up 2 feet and 
rolled in the air as it feel onto the ground. Blood came squirting 
into the air out of Gene body.

<Cyrus>: Hooray!  The weenie speaks for all of us!

Tenchi took Sesami out of Genes arms and he held her tightly.
Washu came running towards them. "Do something Washu ,
make her come back." 

<Misato, as Washu>: Sasami, I order you to come back right now!
<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: That didn't work!
<Misato, as Washu>: Well, now it's your problem.  I'm going to get
back to my science now.

Tenchi said to Washu as he cried.  He gave little taps onto 
Sesames cheeks "Please wake up Sesami don't die on me I never 
told you how I feel about you Sesami"

<Ken>: Yes, you pump firmly on the chest three times, then
tap the cheeks.  Everybody knows that about CPR.

Sesami slowly opened her eyes and looked at Tenchi.
"Teeenchiiiii" Sesami said slowly.

<Kiyone, as Sasami>: Your knee is in my stooooomaaaaach.

"I love you Sesami, I always have. I want you Sesami to
be by my side forever. I LOVE YOU" Tenchi said
as his tears fell on Sesami.

"Tenchi I loooovvvvv........" 

<Duo, as Sasami>: ...Ryooooo-Oooooohkiiiii.
<Cyrus>: Hey, that might be the topic of next week's fic!

Sesami said as her eyes closed and she died.

<Ken>: She's dead, Jim.

"NOOOOOOOO" Tenchi said as he looked into the sky,
"This isn't right" He said to himself.

<Cyrus>: Yeah.  This fic isn't right.

"Tenchi what about meee?" Ryoko said to Tenchi as she
cried and faded away.

<Misato>: You know, concern like that always brings a
tear to the eye.

"No wait Ryoko" Tenchi said as he put Sesami down and
got up. "Bring them back Washu all of them" Tenchi
said to Washu

<Ken, as Washu>: Dammit, Jim, I'm a genius, not Jesus.

"I can't do anything Tenchi" Washu replied to Tenchi
as she looked down at Sesami.

Tenchi walked slowly towards Washu and he slapped her
across the face. "You supposed to be the greatest scientist
in the Universe" He said to her as he shook his head. 

<Kiyone>: That, she is.  It doesn't make her a freaking
necromancer, though.

He turned around and kneed in front of Sesamis dead body. 
He put his hand together and he closed his eyes and started 
to pray. "Please Tsunami, Come here and do something"

<Misato>: I'm sorry, Tsunami is busy right now.  If you'll
please leave your name, number, and a short message, she'll
resurrect your dead as soon as possible.

Washu put her hand on her face and she started to cry. She
looked around and saw Mihoshi holding Kyone and crying.
Then she saw Aeka and went to aid her.

<Cyrus>: Hmph.  Her concern is touching.

Tenchi heard a noise and he slowly opened his eyes and he
looked forward. He saw a red flame appear and it slowly
drew into a giant ring of fire. 

<Duo>: Oh, crap.  This isn't going to become a Sigfried
and Roy act, is it?

Then inside the fire started to twirl like a portal. Tenchis 
eyes opened wide he couldn't believe it.

<Ken>: Yeah, a flaming portal.  How inexplicable.  As opposed
to the Wings of the Light Hawk.

Slowly someone started to walk out of the portal or fire. Tenchi
first saw the shoes of the man. He wore black dressing up shoes.
Tenchi started to look up and he saw that the man was wearing
a sharp looking suit.

<Cyrus>: Nothing more evil than an urban professional.

Tenchi looked up at the man face and paused.

"Whhhaaaaatt who are you?" Tenchi said as he started to shake.
He looked at the man and he looked a bit like Genes Evil form.

<Misato>: That is, all of Gene's forms.

But the man was less muscular. He had short hair. His eyes had
a v shape. He had a pointing noise. A mustache and hair under
his lower lip. The mans eyebrows also formed another v. 

<Cyrus>: Satan is brought to you by the letter "V".

"Who are you?" Tenchi said knowing that he will regret that 
question. The man was also blood red with horns. He had a cigar 
in his mouth.

<Duo>: Holy shit!  It's George Burns!

He took a deep breath and inhaled. Then he walked towards
Genes dead body and he exhaled. "You know Tenchi after
Gene left this house he wasn't able to survive at such a young
age. He virtually sold his sold to me to survive to see you again
and to find true love." 

<Duo>: He could have just sold his body.  There a probably
bunches of sexual deviants who would love to help a young boy
earn some money.
<Cyrus>: *coughmrsinistercough*

The strange man said while he looked over to Tenchi. He 
smiled and inhaled again. "And the virus that lived inside 
him would have made him a perfect leader in my armies against 
heaven."

<Ken>: Uh...does AIDS make you some sort of superman now?

"Hold on... You're thh-th-the Dev" Tenchi said as
he stuttered.

<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: Th-th-the Developer of Daikatana!
<Duo>: Aah!  Evil!

"I have many names but I am mostly known either as the
Devil or as I prefer, Satan. That's what you will call me"
Satan said to Tenchi. "Well it looks like you won Tsunami,
You won the bet. Tenchi does love Sesami the most."

<Kiyone>: Okay, this is just getting confusing.  What
the hell is Tsunami doing here?  And why is she making
bets with Satan?
<Misato, as Tsunami>: Alright, I got two-to-one odds
against the Bears.  Who you gonna pick, Satan?
<Cyrus, as Satan>: The Devils.
<Misato, as Tsunami>: Geez, you could at least not bet
on the SAME hockey team every time.  And this is football,
too.

He said as he looked up at a cloud that was hovering over
everyone.

<Ken>: And then it started to rain.

"Tsunami?" Tenchi said to himself.

<Cyrus>: No, just a light rain.  A tsunami's much wetter.
<Kiyone>: Duo, keep your mouth SHUT.
<Duo>: Dammit...

"That's right Tenchi its me" Everyone looked up and saw
the cloud form into Tsunami. She slowly hovered towards
the ground and she stood next to Tenchi. "It looks like you
owe me Satan" She looked straight into the Devils eyes.

<Kiyone>: Oh, just a note of forewarning.  Anybody who sings
"The Devil Came Down to Georgia" during this part gets shot.
<Cyrus>: Dammit.  (puts away banjo)

"I don't think so Tsunami" Satan said as grinned with evil.

"I win Tenchi loves Sesami" Tsunami said as she started to
get angry with Satan.

<Ken>: Betting on Tenchi's pedophilia...thank you Mr. 
Sinister. Only a mind like yours could come up with that 
sort of pastime.

"Yes but our bet was that Sesami will find her true love.
Right?" Satan said

<Misato>: You know, you just want to say something about
Satan finding legal loopholes.  So you do.

"That's right" Tsunami replied.

"You see I don't care if Tenchi loves her but Sesami has
to love him back. She never said that she loves him."
Satan said.

<Kiyone>: This is just sick.  Sick in the head.
<Cyrus>: I know.  They're making bets on the true love
of an eight-year-old?  Mr. Sinister, I want to kick your
ass so bad right now...

"Yes she did" Tsunami said

"I'll show you!" Satan put took his cigar with his left hand
and then he raised his right hand. He wiggled his fingers and
said "Aghra- Marhra- Shim Sharoom" 

<Ken>: Lines straight from the Necronomicon.  The "My First
Necronomicon" from Fisher-Price.
<Duo>: Occultism.  Be sure to start young.

Then Sesamis body started to raise and she hovered in mid air. 
Her eyes started to open. "Sesami can you hear me?" Satan said 
to her.

<Misato, as Sasami>: No, I'm dead.  Dumbass.  Now put me down.

"Yes I can hear you. But where am I?" She said looking around.

<Kiyone>: You're in hell.
<Cyrus>: No, she's just in this shitty fic.
<Kiyone>: Like I said.  Hell.

"SESAMI" Tenchi said.
"She can't hear you, she is in another dimension she can't
even see you." 

<Ken>: "Another dimension", huh?  Looks like somebody's been
watching a little to much edited Dragon Ball Z.

Satan said. "Look Sesami I have to ask you a question and 
you have to tell me the truth, It's very important"

<Duo, as Satan>: This is very important to your Uncle Satan,
okay?

"Oh ok" Sesami said with a worried look on her face.

"Who do you truly love Sesami?" Satan asked her.

<Cyrus>: She's going to say Gene.  That's what I love about
this fic.  She's going to say Gene.
<Duo>: I think Cyrus just lost it.

"I - I - I love Gene" Sesami said

<Cyrus>: See!  I'm not insane!  She said Gene!
<Kiyone>: That isn't why we thought you were insane.
<Cyrus>: Really?
<Kiyone>: We thought you were insane because you seemed to
be enjoying it.

"Do you truly love him? and what about Tenchi?" Satan asked.

"I like Tenchi a lot but I truly love Gene" She said. Then her
eyes closed and he body dropped to the ground.

<Misato>: Yes, an eight-year-old definitely knows about true
love.  Sure.
<Kiyone>: But you forget.  She's known Gene for all of...what,
a week now?

Tenchi who was already kneeling put his hands on his face and
started to cry.

<Duo, as Tenchi>: Dammit, now I have to choose between the hot,
of-age Ryoko, the hot, of-age Ayeka, the hot, of-age Washu--
<Cyrus>: --adult form only--
<Duo, as Tenchi>: --or the hot, of-age Mihoshi!  This sucks!

"Well there you have it Tsunami. I win there is no true love in
this millennium. The heaven won the all the time till now. Earth
will belong to me and I will add this place to my collection."
Satan said as he laughed with the evilest laugh ever. It send
shivers down everyone's spine.

(Everyone bursts out laughing.)
<Ken>: *laugh*...oh, the imagery...
<Kiyone>: It's the...*laugh*..."evilest laugh ever!"
<Cyrus>: Stop the MST, I want to *laugh* just end it after
that!
<Misato>: *laugh* but "It send shivers down everyone's
spine." *laugh* I hope their collective spine recovers!

"Nooo you wont take this Earth. You haven't won Satan.
There is one more thing" Tsunami said as she walked over
to the head of Genes evil body.

<Duo>: I want to *laugh* make a joke *laugh* about "giving
*laugh* head", but all I can think of is the *laugh*
"evilest laugh ever"!

Satan stopped laughing and said "Face it bitch I've won"

Tsunami looked at Satan and then a red rose appeared in her
hand. She looked at Gene. Then sunlight started to surround
her. She dropped the rose onto Genes face. She closed her
eyes said her prayer.

<Cyrus>: Wooh...deep breaths.  Everybody normal now?
<Misato>: I think so...

The rose hit Genes face and his body transformed into his
human form. His face and body started to fly up. Then his
face flew towards his body and they connected. His body feel
onto the ground. He slowly moved and got up.

<Kiyone>: Aw, DAMMIT!  I was hoping he was dead for good.

Satan wasn't pleased so he raised his hand and put Gene into a
cage of fire. Now Tsunami wasn't pleased.

"Gene" Tsunami said.

"Yes Tsunami??" Gene said.

<Ken>: Ah, yes.  He knows Tsunami...how?
<Cyrus>: We'll just have to take the author's word for it.
<Ken>: Since when have we done that?

"I'm going to ask you a question and its very important
that you tell me the truth" Tsunami said. She said the same
words as Satan, and she was very confident.

<Duo, as Gene>: Okay miss nice lady goddess person.

Satan growled " What is she trying to do?" He said quietly to
himself.

"I'll try to help you as much as possible" Gene said.

"Gene who do you truly love" Tsunami said to Gene

"I really love Sesami, she's the love of my life" Gene said.

<Kiyone>: Pedophile.  You are a goddamned pedophile.  You
disgust me.  And everyone else.  You don't fall in love with
a girl who is at least ten years your junior.  Even more so
if you're twenty.
<Cyrus>: Sorry about that there.  The point needed to be made.
And not by jokes.  Sasami lemons are just wrong, people.
<Duo>: Great, when did this turn into a fucking after-school
special?

"Well it looks like he loves her and she loves him." Tsunami
said. She looked over to Satan and said " Well it looks like
Good triumphs over evil yet again"

<Misato>: Never underestimate the powers of pedophilia!

"Hahaha fine, you win. Sesami gets to grow up into her adult
age and you finally become an Angel. I'll take out Genes evil
virus and I'll let him live his life." 

<Kiyone>: Yeah, his life as a child molester.
<Duo>: Do you have some sort of deep dark secret in your
past?

Satan said. He looked over to Sesami and he raised his hand 
and said some dark words.

<Cyrus, as Satan>: Black, forest green, burnt sienna, midnight
blue--
<Kiyone>: Alright, you can put away the box of Crayolas, Cyrus.

Sesamis body started to age rapidly. She must have aged until
she's 20. 

<Ken>: How convenient.
(Everything freezes, except for Cyrus, who is bathed with a
light so pure, so gentle, so soft, it could only be fluorescent.)
<Cyrus>: Hi there, boys and girls.  This is me, the author of
the MST, speaking through my avatar.  I'd like to clarify something 
for you.  I am a firm believer in the fact that suddenly aging
Sasami is not an acceptable practice.  It does not make what is
about to happen in this fic okay, just because the character
suddenly has a nice set of tits.  She is still mentally a child.
It is still statutory rape to me, and to many other people.  So,
to summarize, NEVER HAVE ANYONE FUCK SASAMI, YOU BASTARDS.  OR
TSUNAMI, FOR THAT MATTER.  Thank you.
(Everything returns to normal.)
<Duo>: Gee, I wonder what happened there?
<Misato>: I don't know.  *coughgodcomplexcough*
<Cyrus>: Hey!

Then Satan took away the fire cage. Sesami woke up and then she 
got up. She looked around and she saw Gene looking into the ground 
and crying.

<Duo>: Thereby reinforcing my opinion that Gene is actually an
effeminate loser.
<Kiyone>: Thank you, Sherlock.
<Duo>: Shut up, Watson.

"Gene" she yelled "I love you"

He looked up and saw Sesami running towards him. He got
up and he started to run towards Sesami. They both opened
their arms and hugged each other. They stared into each others
eyes and kissed.

<Ken>: Hmm...the nose would probably get in the way there.

"I'll love you for ever Sesami" Gene said.

"I'll love you too" Sesami replied.

"I hate this love stuff. It sickens me to my soul." Satan said.

<Cyrus>: I hate this dialogue stuff.  It sickens me to my soul.

"Why? Because you've never loved yourself?"
Tsunami said. but this time Tsunami had 2 wings and a
golden halo.

<Misato>: Huh.  Tsunami is the eighteenth angel.

"No I'm not into love. Hey Gene you know I still own you
and I will never leave you alone. " Satan said as he inhaled
his cigar.

<Duo, as Satan>: Gene, you are my BITCH!
<Cyrus>: "Raped by Satan: The Gene Mesaki Story" tonight on
Biography.

"As long as I am with Sesami nothing will hurt me" Gene
said after he broke the kiss.

<Misato>: Because Sasami is one bad mother--
<Kiyone>: Shut your mouth!
<Misato>: I'm just talking about Sasami!
<Kiyone>: Oh, well I can dig it!

"HAHAHA" Satan said "Its time for me to go, but I will
be back, you haven't seen the last of me" He turned around
and started to walk towards the portal.

"Nothing will happen to you Gene and Sesami your true love
will get you through anything" Tsunami said as she flew up into
the sky.

<Ken>: Yes, the true love you formed over the course of one
shopping trip will conquer all!
<Cyrus>: I bet it could conquer France.

Satan looked over his shoulder and looked at Tsunami flying
away, then he slowly said "We'll see about that . Yes that's
right we'll see about that. Hahaha" He started laughing again
and then he walked through the portal.

<Duo, as Satan>: Did I mention we'll see about that?
<Cyrus>: And on that note, let's take a break.  We'll need 
one, too.  This is a looooong fic.
<Misato>: Can I drink?
<Cyrus>: Not yet.
<Misato>: But I'll be able to, right?
<Cyrus>: Okay, I think we can relax in the hot springs for
a while.
<Kiyone>: Yeah, we need to wash away the filth of this fic.

_____________________________________________________________________

And now...
MORE OBLIGATORY HOT SPRINGS EPISODE!

	"So anyway, I thought that meant the primary thrust converter
was out of alignment, and that meant I would have to go to deck 12
and completely retool the ionization nacelles..."  Wormon was 
rambling about the basic maintenance he had performed on the ship.
	"Why the hell did I give him the manual?" Cyrus whispered to
Duo.
	"Otherwise we'd all be dead and the ship would have broken
down," Duo replied.
	"Would that be worse than this?" Cyrus asked.
	"Probably not.  Man, I bet that they're having hot lesbian
sex over there right now."  Duo gestured to the fence on the other
side of which was the female hot spring.
	"Probably not," replied Cyrus.  "Hey, where's Ken?"

	Well, funny he should ask, because at that moment Ken was
stealthily infiltrating the other hot spring.  Of course, he had a
different idea of the traditional peeping outfit than Duo and 
Cyrus, as he was dressed in a completely black suit, much like a
ninja.  Slowly, he crawled low through the corridor which contained
the doors to both hot springs.  Back pressed against the wall, Ken
pushed open the door to the women's onsen.
	He held his breath, unsure of his detection, until the sounds
of the two women holding conversation floated to his ears.
	"Truth or dare?"  That was Kiyone's voice.
	"Hmmm...truth."  That was Misato, most definitely.
	"Okay, who's the most bishie of all the guys?"
	"You have to say 'Is it true?'"
	"Okay, is it true you're a bitch about stuff like that?"
	"Is it true you're a mean drunk?"
	"Is it true that you're a slutty drunk?"
	"Is it true that THERE'S A GIANT SPIDER ON YOUR SHOULDER?!"
	"AAAGH!"
	"Heh, gotcha."
	"Dammit, Misato.  We were just about to start wrestling, too."
	"What?"
	"Nothing."
	By this time, Ken had managed to sneak into the onsen.  And
he was getting a good view, too.  A view which would definitely 
fuel his adolescent mind for quite a while.  Suddenly, he was tapped
on the shoulder by a large, demonic creature.
	"Who are you?" Ken asked.
	"I'm the plot device that keeps male characters from being
able to get more than a passing glimpse of female characters in the
nude," said the plot device.
	"Drat," said Ken as the plot device kicked him right into the
hot spring, startling Misato and Kiyone.
	"What are you doing here?" yelled Kiyone as Ken's head rose
above the water.
	"Umm..." said Ken, who was too busy checking out Kiyone's
assets to form a cohesive response.
	"Oh, he's dressed like a ninja!" said Misato.
	"Umm..." said Ken, whose attention had just been drawn to
the purple-haired goddess's ass.  Assets, I mean.
	"Yeah, he is.  And he has a grappling hook!"  Kiyone was now
less startled and angry.  Although it might have been some of the
sake talking.
	"Um..." said Ken, whose eyes were working overtime to see as
much as was humanly possible of the two woman standing in front of
him.
	"You want to come here and sit with us?  We're playing truth
or dare," Misato said.  She had also taken a few drinks of alcohol 
herself.
	"Um..." said Ken.  His mind was currently dredging up stories
he had read that had begun this way.  Stories from sites he shouldn't
have gone to yet.
	"It could be fun..." Kiyone said, looking at Ken seductively.
	"Urk." said Ken.  His mind had given out on him, and he was 
now face down in the water.
	"Huh, and I'm the slutty one," mused Misato as she sat back
down in the water.
	"Hey, Misato," said Cyrus.
	"Ack!  What do you want?"
	"Did you two kill Ken?"
	"No.  Is that what you wanted?"
	"No, I just wanted to tell you that we're going back into
the theater.  And that Kiyone's been stealing glances at your ass."
He ducked back down under the fence before Kiyone could throw 
something at him.
	Misato stepped out of the water.  "Damn fanfics," she 
muttered as she wrapped a towel around herself.  "Hey, were you
checking out my ass?" she asked Kiyone.
	"Well...yes."
	"Yeah.  I'm the slutty drunk.  Sure."  Misato walked out of
the onsen to go change and get back into the theater.

_____________________________________________________________________

<Duo>: So, did you take pictures?
<Ken>: Well, no.
<Cyrus>: Could you draw them?
<Ken>: Maybe.
<Cyrus>: Well, was her pubic hair--
(Kiyone and Misato enter the theater)
<Cyrus>: --and that's how you solve the headache rememdy 
puzzle in Curse of Monkey Island.
<Duo>: Yeah, that's a tricky puzzle.
 
Tenchi paused and instead of crying he was happy for Gene
and Sesami. Then something said to him "Hey Tenchi no one
will remember what you said to Sesami " Tenchi guessed
that it was Tsunamis voice.

<Cyrus, as Announcer>: No, I'm sorry, it's your fourth grade
teacher, Mrs. Meeny!  Yes, Tenchi, this is your life!

"Tenchi!!!!!" Ryoko yelled.

"Lord Tenchi!!!!!" Aeka yelled.

They both ran towards Tenchi and gave him a tackle hug where
they took him into the ground.

<Ken>: Hmmm...I guess Ryoko must have phased them through.
Otherwise, there would probably be some spinal fracturing.
<Duo>: Gee, thanks.  Got another dissertation on the physics
of anime ready, professor?

"I'm ok thanks girls, now please get off" Tenchi said 

<Duo>: I think he means "get me off".
<Kiyone>: Duo...you only have a certain number of chances, and
we aren't even in the lemon section yet.

*It looks like Tsunami was right and Ryoko forgot that I told 
Sesami that I loved her* He thought to himself.

<Misato>: We didn't forget, in case you were wondering.  You
sick disgusting pedophile.

"Ok Ryoko you go help out Kyone and Mihoshi. And you Aeka go 
please help out grandfather." He said to the 2 girls.

Aeka quickly got up. "Sesami? You're , What happened"
She said in shock. "You're older" 

<Kiyone>: Oh, she's older!  That makes the sex OKAY.  Wait,
no it doesn't, because she's just a GODDAMNED EIGHT YEAR OLD
IN A GROWN WOMAN'S BODY YOU SICK FREAK.

Sesami looked at Aeka and then she looked back at Gene. Gene 
nodded and he broke off the hug. Sesami ran towards Aeka and 
hugged her. They walked into the house while Gene followed. 

<Duo>: Threesome!
<Kiyone>: NO!  NO NO NO NO NO! (pulls out a newspaper and 
begins whapping Duo with it) BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!

Sesami told Aeka everything.

<Misato, as Sasami>: You see, the author wants to fuck me,
but he doesn't want to get attacked for being a pedophile,
so he figured that by having me grow up suddenly, everything
would be okay!

Ryoko flew towards Kyone and Mihoshi. They picked
up Kyone and slowly walked towards the house.

Tenchi was all alone with Washu. He stood up and looked
at her. "I'm sorry Washu, I can't believe I hit you will you
ever forgive me?" Tenchi said as he stared at the ground.

<Duo, as Washu>: Look, I can forgive the guy for raping me 
up the ass, I can forgive you for hitting me.

"Tenchi it doesn't matter but what you said to Sesami.
Did you mean that?" Washu said as she lifted his chin with
her right hand.

"No I didn't mean it. I thought that if I told her that I love
her then she will live on and not die" Tenchi told Washu

<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: Yes!  I'm not a pedophile!  Heh heh heh!

"Look Washu I can never lie to you, you are a very
important person to me" Tenchi said "Well except all
those experiments"

<Ken, as Tenchi>: Experiments are not very important people
to me.

"Tenchi you mean that about me being a important person
to you?" Washu asked Tenchi while her eyes widened with
amazement.

"Yeah Washu seriously. Ryoko and Aeka are always trying
to compete over me but I think that they don't even care about
me" Tenchi said.

<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: But you, the one who looks like a little
girl...you are the one I truly love.  BECAUSE I'M BEING WRITTEN
BY A SICK PEDOPHILE.

Then Washu gave Tenchi a big hug and he hugged her back.
*No one can know the one I truly love* Tenchi thought to
himself. "Hey lets go inside now" Tenchi broke off the hug
and they walked inside the house.

<Duo, as Tenchi>: And fuck like minks!

In the living room Gene waited for Tenchi and as soon as he
saw him he ran towards Tenchi. "Tenchi I'm so sorry for all
the problems I cause. I understand if you want me to leave"
Gene said with a worried look.

<All>: YES!  LEAVE!

"Haha now why would you say that Gene. I love you and
you're my brother. I so happy that you found love" Tenchi
said to Gene "But I can't believe that you sold your soul
just for me"

<Duo>: Uh, he did?  I thought he sold his soul so he wouldn't
have to give blowjobs for food.

"I don't care about that" Gene smiled at Tenchi. Then both
their stomach started to growl. "Hey everyone lets order
some food"

Every one agreed and Tenchi went and made the phone call.
Gene went to Kyone and he apologized to her. She
didn't mind because she knew that it wasn't the real Gene.

<Duo>: Damn, Kiyone, you fell for THAT?
<Kiyone>: It's not me!  I swear!

Then Gene also apologized to Yosho and he also accepted.

After Gene apologized. He thought to himself and he ran
towards Tenchi while he was speaking on the phone.

<Cyrus, as Gene>: Hey, Tenchi, apologize to the pizza guy
for me!

"Tenchi hold on a sec" Gene said to him.

"Ehh hold on" Tenchi said to the restaurant worker. "What
is it Gene?"

"I just want you to get some special items" Gene said
then he slowly whispered the items into Tenchis ear. 

<Duo, as Tenchi>: Oh, you naughty boy!  I can't wait
until we use them tonight!

Tenchi was kind of shocked but he knew why Gene would need
them. "Ohh and finally hide those things and put them into the
refrigerator so no one can get to them"

<Misato>: Does their refrigerator have a time lock or
something?  Because otherwise it's pretty easy to get to them.

"Ok Gene don't worry" Tenchi said as he smiled at Gene.

Gene walked back to the living room and he saw that Washu
was back in her lab. Nobuyuki and Yosho sat around the little
table drinking sucke. 

<Kiyone>: As opposed to reading "sucke", which is what we're
doing.

Then he looked kind of confused. He Aeka , Ryoko, Mihoshi and 
Kyone sitting in front of the television watching some police 
shows.

<Ken>: Is a sentence fragment.

Gene walked towards the table and he sat beside Yosho and
opposite Nobyuki. "What's going on? I thought that everyone
would care more about everything that happened today"
Gene said really confused.

<Cyrus>: YEAH!  I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WOULD GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
THE DEATHS OF AZAKA AND KAMIDAKE!  YOU BASTARDS!

Yosho poured Gene a little glass full of sucke and passed it
over to him. "Hehehe You see Gene since the first day these
girls moved into this house crazy stuff has happened." Yosho
said to Gene with a drunk smile.

<Duo>: Uh-oh, they're about to start making out!

"Gene You shouldn't be drinking that" Gene looked over
outside the kitchen and he saw Sesami standing there in
different clothes giving him a smile.

<Misato>: Ooh, that's the sort of smile that says, "I'm
wearing different clothes."  If you know what I mean.

"Come here you" Gene said.

Sesami walked over to Gene and she sat on his lap "Now
where did you get those clothes?" He asked her as he hugged
her tightly.

<Kiyone>: Makes sense.  She's probably trying to escape.

"Well I went upstairs with you. You went to your room
for some clothes and I looked in my room. Then I walked
into my room and I saw these clothes on the floor with a
letter from Tsunami" Sesami said

<Cyrus, as Sasami>: It says, "Dear Sasami, what we had was
very special, but I just don't think I can go on like..."

"Wow a letter from Tsunami?" Gene said looking at Sesami
"Now what about the girls"

"Well I told them everything while you chatted with Tenchi
and when you got dressed" Sesami said "They are very happy
for us especially Ryoko and Aeka because now they say that
Tenchi is theirs"

<Kiyone>: Yeah, they were all afraid Gene was going to
steal him away.

"Haha very funny" Gene said. 

<Cyrus>: No.  It's not.  Nothing in this is funny.

He picked up the little glass and he drank it down. For a 
second his face turned red and steam came out of his ears. 

<Ken>: Tonight, on "Sight Gags that Don't Work in Text"...

Sesami started to giggle then Gene poured a glass and handed it 
over to Sesami. "Your turn babe" Gene said with a smile.

"I don't know about this Gene" She said with a worried
look. "I'll try it but it will be my first time" Sesami said.

<Misato>: Reinforcing the fact that SASAMI IS STILL A LITTLE
GIRL, EVEN IF SHE LOOKS LIKE A BABE!

"Hey tonight will be first night for a lot of things" Gene said
in a seductive voice to her as he kissed her on the cheek.

"Ohh sounds like fun what are you up to?" the drunk
Nobuyuki said.

"Hahaha it doesn't involve you dad" Gene said. "All right
Sesami it's time to drink up"

<Kiyone>: Get her drunk and score.  The Gene Mesaki motto.

Gene slowly watched Sesami drink up the little shot glass or
sucke, her face turned light pink for a second and then she
shook her head. "Wow Gene I don't think I'll ever do that
again" Sesami said to Gene. "I don't want you drinking this
and turning bad"

<Misato>: Too late.

"Turning bad?" Gene said.

"That's right on television I saw that people turn violent and
they made up excuses that they would never become drunk"
Sesami said with a worried look.

"Ok I wont drink ever again" Gene said as he moved his face
closer to Sesamis. "This will be my last night. Now give me a
Eskimo kiss"

<Cyrus>: Good God!  He even treats her like an eight-year-old!

"Well this won't be your last time but just watch out" Sesami
said.

"Ahh GIMME GIMME GIMME" Gene said. Their noses touched each 
others tips and they moved their heads side to side. "MMMM 
Hehehe"

<Ken>: All I can think is "Lolita".

Ding dong the door bell rang and Gene got up to answer it.
He saw a kid in a red shirt and a blue hat. He was around
18 years old and he looked like a nice guy.

<Cyrus>: Hey!  He looks like a nice guy!  Why not invite 
him to live in the house, like everybody else?

"Your food is here" The guy said

"Man you guys are fast" Gene said surprised

"Well we where kissing for a while" Sesami said. She was
quietly standing behind Gene.

"Wow too bad it went so fast" Gene replied to her.

<Duo>: I bet Sasami's going to hear that phrase a lot
tonight.

"Excuse me" The guy said ruddily "That will be a 300"

"Ehh say what?" Gene said

<Ken, as Gene>: You need money to buy things?  When did
this happen?

"Well I did have to go and get those special items you
wanted" The guy said while he raised his right eyebrow.

<Cyrus, as Delivery Guy>: Yeah, the EZ Cheez, the Club
Crackers, and a six-pound block of pig fat.

"Right!! Well thank you very much" Gene put his hand in
his pocket and pulled. He gave the guy his money and called
for Tenchi.

<Duo, as Gene>: Tenchi, we can start the fun!

"Thank you very much" The guy said and he walked away.
"And have lots of fun"

<Duo, as Gene>: What, you want to join in?  There's plenty
of room for you.

"Yeah thanks, bye" Gene said. Then Tenchi came and Gene
gave him the plastic bag with the special items in it "You know
where to put there right?"

<Duo, as Tenchi>: Yep, right up my--
<Kiyone>: NO!  You've said too much already.
<Duo>: Man, and that was a good one.

"Yes I do" Tenchi said "Thanks for paying. I went and set the
table."

"Gene. What's in that bag?" Sesami said as they all
walked back into the living room. But Tenchi went into
the kitchen.

<Cyrus, as the Author>: Oops!  Forgot to add that about Tenchi
entering another room.  Sorry 'bout that!

"It's nothing" Gene re assured her. He looked at the table
and he saw everyone sitting around it with their chopsticks in
their hand. "Geez your all animals"

<Ken>: Hunger.  How uncouth.

"Excuse me but who are you calling an animal? If it was not
for the attack you did on us. We would not be so low on
energy and so hungry" Aeka said.

<Misato>: Wait, isn't that a plot device from Dragon Ball?
And Digimon?  But not Tenchi?
<Kiyone>: Wow.  It's almost like he's not entirely sure what
he's writing about.

"I'm sorry" Gene said

"Ahh don't worry about it Gene our little princess here is just
upset that her little sister is a lot prettier than she is. At least
you bought the food for us" Ryoko said.

<Duo>: Yeah, normally Gene's a colossal spendthrift.  He has to
save money, what with his superstar *laugh* boxing career!

"GRRrrrr At least I'm a lot prettier than you. YOU YOU
MONSTER" said Aeka as she yelled at Ryoko.

"Wait girls please don't fight in the house." Tenchi said as he
quickly sat between them.

<Cyrus, as Tenchi>: Yes, strip down and fight in a pit of mud!

Gene and Sesami sat besides each other. Tenchi had ordered
lots of different kinds of food like Gene favorite. Mongolian
Beef, Sushi, Fish...etc. a lot of food was there.

Through the meal Gene and Sesami couldn't stop feeding each
other. Sesami out food into Genes mouth and Gene did the
same thing to Sesami.

<Misato, as Sasami>: Hey, don't shove this sh--*munch munch*
<Cyrus, as Gene>: Ha!  Take that, bi--*munch munch*
<Misato, as Sasami>: Yeah, asshole.  Suck it down.

Ryoko looked at them in jealousy then she said "Tenchi
when will we do that?"

"You will never do such things with Lord Tenchi" Aeka
said.

"Ahh you 2 should get a room" Nobuyuki said. He was
still very drunk

<Duo>: Yeah, arguing right here at the table!  You sluts!

Everyone laughed at Nobuyuki even Yosho. They quietly
well almost quietly everyone finished their meal. Gene kept
on giggling with Sesami and Aeka kept on arguing with
Ryoko.

After dinner everyone was really tired and stuffed. They
decided to go to bed early. Well everyone except Sesami
and Gene.

<Kiyone>: Perhaps we'll be lucky and they'll never go to bed.

Sesami went to her room with Aeka. Then she got undressed
and she took a shower. 

<Cyrus>: With Ayeka?  Sick!

Meanwhile Gene took a shower and shaved. 

<Duo, as Gene>: Let's see...I think this looks like a "G".

He knew that Sesami was coming tonight.

Gene went into his room and changed his bed sheets to silk
sheets that he bought at the mall. He got 2 candles that had a
sweet smell. Gene was never so excited before about a girl.

<Misato>: Yeah, the rest were just cheap whores.
<Kiyone>: Hey!
<Misato>: Oh, that's right.  He nailed you in the first one,
didn't he?  In that case, they were just cheap whores and you.
<Kiyone>: Thanks.  I think.

"Aeka I'm going to go sleep on the couch and watch TV" Sesami
said as she came into the room.

"Mmmmm Tenchi" Aeka said to herself. She was dreaming
about having sex with Tenchi again.

<Kiyone>: That makes one person in this household who ISN'T
fantasizing about nailing a little girl.

"Enough with the dreams" Sesami said to herself. She walked
out of her room. Then she quietly tip toed to Genes room.

She quietly turned the knob. Gene heard and he hopped into bed
after he turned the lights of. He acted that he was sleeping.

<All but Misato>: OH, NOT AGAIN!
<Misato>: Huh?
<Cyrus>: In the last chapter, Gene almost molested Sasami "in
his sleep".  The last thing we need to remember right now is
what a sick pedophile he is.

Sesami walked in and she was amazed at the sight of the red bed
sheets and the sweet smell of the red candles. *Hmm maybe he
was expecting me* 

<Duo>: Ya think?

She thought to herself. She closed and locked the door. Then 
walked over and she saw Gene sleeping. "Gene" She whispered.

<Kiyone, as Sasami>: There's no way on Earth I'm going to
have sex with you.  Enjoy the scented candles, perv.

"Wha wha what is it?" Gene said. He slowly opened his eyes
and he saw Sesami standing there next to his bed.

~~~~~~~~~GENES POINT OF VIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<All but Misato>: OH, GOD DAMMIT!
<Misato>: What now?
<Cyrus>: All of the lemon sections are from "GENES POINT OF
VIEW".  I guess so we can more accurately fantasize nailing
a young girl if we had no idea about sex.
<Misato>: I am going to drink this entire fic away.
<Kiyone>: You wish.

I opened my eyes and I saw Sesami in a pink T-shirt with baby
blue shorts. I was acting tired but it was hard for me to hide
it because I was so excited about her coming tonight.

<Ken>: Please, don't say "coming".  Just wait until the
lemon section so you can scar my youthful mind then.
<Cyrus>: Um...(whistles and looks at the ground)

"Gene you don't mind if we cuddle up tonight. Your room
is so much nicer than mine and Aeka is having those special
dreams about Tenchi and she is really loud sometimes" Sesami
said to me.

*Cuddle up* I though. Then I said "Sure Sesami I have some
very bad things to tell you."

<Duo, as Gene>: I'm gay.  Very gay.  So gay, in fact, that
there will be no shitty lemon portion of this fic.

"What is it?" She said. She slowly laid down beside me.  I was
on my left side so I could look at her.

"You know when I still had that thing in me?" I told her I tried
to look as worried as I could.

<Kiyone>: What, the dick up your ass?  Yeah, we all remember.

"Yes that's right. I remember" She said.

"Well that thing made me sleep with Washu and Kyone" I told
her.

<Cyrus>: Oh, okay.  That's a great excuse.  "The virus made me
nail other chicks!"  I'll have to remember that one.
<Kiyone>: You'll have to get a girlfriend to cheat on, first.

I couldn't even look at her. I turned to my right side and prayed
to myself. I told her "I understand if you never want to see me
again"

<All>: LEAVE HIM!  LEAVE HIM!  LEAVE HIM!

I felt right hand come under me and her left hand on top. She
wrapped her arms and legs around me and said "Look Gene
I don't care what you did with them. I know that evil was inside
you and all that I care about is that I'll have you for the rest of
my life."

<ALL>: DAMMIT!
<Duo>: Is that Sasami, or someone really fucking stupid?

I was shocked. I can't believe she just told me that. I said
"You mean that?" Then I slowly turned to my left and I
wrapped my arms around her waist.

"Yes I do Gene. I don't care for them as long as I have you."
She said in a seductive voice.

<Misato>: It doesn't matter if you care for him.  He has to
care for you.

"I love you Sesami. and I want to make you happy for
the rest of my life" I told her.

<Cyrus>: The rest of her life, my ass.  They'll all be
on Springer within a month.

"Ohh I love you so much Gene" She told me as he came
in close to me for a passionate kiss.

We kissed and I felt her little tongue come into my mouth. I
slowly sucked on her tongue and I put my tongue in her mouth.
She kept on giving little moans.

<Duo>: Huh.  Guess the chick'll actually cum first for a 
change.
<Kiyone>: Maybe that's the way it always goes for you...

I slowly kissed down her neck and to her shirt. Then she
stopped. "Gene this is my first time, please be gentle" she told
me.

"Don't worry Sesami nothing will ever hurt you as long as I am
around." I told her.

<Ken>: Unless I get there to slap the bitch upside her head!
<Duo>: Uh, Ken?
<Ken>: What, fool?
<Duo>: Nevermind.

She slowly sat up. Then she put her hands on her waist and lifted
her shirt. I was stunned as I looked at her body.

<Kiyone>: Yeah.  You were expecting an eight-year-old, weren't
you?  YOU FUCKING PEDOPHILE!

"Please don't look Gene" She told me. She got up and she slowly
pulled down her shorts. Then she slowly climbed back in bed.

"Why Sesami?" I asked her as I couldn't stop starring at her milk
white body. Who would have guessed that her pussy hair was the
same as hair

<Ken>: Who would have guessed, indeed.  Hair is basically the
same all over one's body.  I would have thought that tentacles
sprouted from her pubes, or something.
<Cyrus>: We've corrupted him, Duo.  His fragile mind is forever
warped.
<Duo>: I know.  I'm so proud.

"Because I am very shy about my figure" She said. She didn't
even look at me.

"Sesami I love everything about you. You have the most
beautiful body I have ever seen" I told her.

<Duo, as Gene>: Although, your old one was a lot better in my
opinion.

"You don't mean that, you just want to have sex with me. That's
why you changed your sheets and you put the candles up."
She said.

<Kiyone>: Holy shit!  Common sense!  Run, girl, run!

"Sesami I mean everything I just told you. All the other girls
are jealous of you. They always stare at you." I said. Then
she slowly looked at me and I looked into her deep pink
eyes. "Those 2 candles symbolize us Sesami, but not like the
candle my love for you will never die out." 

<Misato>: So, they symbolize your love, except they don't, 
because they're different from your love.  I think I'm confused.
<Duo>: Perhaps the two candles symbolize how there are two of 
them.  Or something.
<Misato>: Thanks.  That's much better.

I slowly laid down to her right side and I put my head on her 
shoulder. "If you want I can never have sex with you as long 
as I get to hug you and be by your side." I couldn't believe 
I just said that.

<Misato>: Neither can we.  It's such an obvious lie to get her
to sleep with you.

She laughed and said " You always sleep naked Gene?"

I looked down and I saw my hard dick. SHIT I couldn't believe
I  forgot to wear underwear. "Yeah so" I said

She stopped laughing and she said " I have never seen a man
penis before and this close"

<Kiyone>: Once again driving home the point that she was an 
eight-year-old less than twenty-four hours ago.

She took her left hand and she ran her index finger down my
abs and she slowly grabbed the sides of my dick. Her soft hands
made me moan instantly. "Wait STOP" I said.

<Ken>: Yeah, stop this scene.  You're both overacting the passion.
<Misato, as Sasami>: Oh, your handshake is so firm!  OH GOD, YES!
SHAKE MY HAND!  SHAKE MY HAND!
<Duo>: Do that again, please.
<Cyrus>: Yes.  And throw back your head and arch your back, this
time.
<Misato>: Perverts.

"Did I do something wrong Gene?" She said as she let go of
my dick.

"No no no it's just that I had something planned for you" I told
her as seductively as I could.

<Duo, as Gene>: Alright, put on these Sailor Moon panties and
this second grader uniform.  Now, call me "daddy".
<Kiyone>: Duo, the line has been crossed.  After the MST, you
get a ten second head start.

I made her lie down totally still. "Ok Gene" She said. Then I
reached under the bed and I pulled out a little plastic bag.

"These are the special items I made the kid buy for me" I said

<Cyrus>: God, Gene.  Can you possibly NOT manipulate children
for a few scenes?

then I took out a little white cardboard box and I took out a
can of whip cream from the bag. He charged me a lot for 2
items.

I put the white box on her left side and the whip cream on her
right side. I knelt down over her legs parallel to her. 

<Misato>: You know, if you look on the big list of erotic words,
I doubt you'll find "parallel".

My dick laid right on top of her pussy. I put it there just to 
see how wet she will get. She was starting to get wet.

I slowly opened the box and she saw the fruit inside. "Ah
strawberries" She said with a smile.

<Duo>: I think Gene's more interested in cherries tonight.
<Kiyone>: Dammit, Duo, I'm going to--
<Duo>: --what?  Kill me again?
<Misato>: Great work, Kiyone.  You've pretty much given
Duo a license to say whatever he wants.

"That's right" I said " I want to make this as romantic as
possible"

<All>: Too late.

I picked up one of the strawberries and put it by her
mouth. She understood and she took a bite. Then I had the
half bitten strawberry over her left nipple. The juice started to
drip onto her nipple. With every drop she let out a little
moan. "Hmmm Gene" She said.

<Kiyone>: Stop with the moaning already!  Wait until you're
actually having sex!

I let another couple of drops on her left nipple and then I
placed the bitten strawberry on her right nipple. The
strawberries were fresh and cold. I just brought them up
from the refrigerator. I felt her pre-cum coming out of her
pussy and getting wetter under my balls.

<Cyrus>: And now, we see the ignorance, as it flows forth
like so much pre-cum from Sasami's pussy.
<Kiyone>: I would rebuke you, but that was much more erotic
than the actual fic.

I lowered my head and started to like her left nipple. Then
I sucked on her nipple and she moaned a little louder, I felt her
nipple getting harder and harder. After I liked and sucked all
the juices off I started to nibble on the nipple.

I took little bites and she was enjoying this. 

<Misato>: Ugh...cannibalism fetish.  Ugh.

My right hand was occupied with messaging her ass and my left 
hand was messaging  her right breast.

"How do you like it so far?" I asked

"Please don't stop Gene" She said, every move I did
and she watched. 

<Ken>: Writing with one hand results in a lot of mistakes,
doesn't it?

I felt her pussy getting wetter and wetter.

I ate the strawberry on her nipple and I took out another one
from the box. I took a bit and I let the juice drip onto her
right nipple and breast. Again I liked her breast clean. 

<Kiyone>: If you like her breasts clean, why do you keep
putting food on them?

Then I sucked and finally I nibbled.

I raised my right knee and I took her left leg from under me
and I put it around my waist. 

<Cyrus>: Isn't that a wrestling move?

Then I did the same with her right left. Her legs where 
wrapped around me. I watched her eat another strawberry and she 
sucked on it. Some of the juices that she didn't get dripped 
down her cheeks. 

<Duo>: Geez, a sloppy eater.

She sucked the strawberry dry and then she ate it.

I reached for the whip cream and I shook the can. 

<Kiyone>: BOOM!  It explodes and kills you both.  The end.

I started to spray her from about a inch above her pussy 
hair to the bottom of her neck. She had a white line on whip 
cream separating her left and right side.

<Cyrus>: Now that I've prepped the patient, I'll just make an
incision along this line...

I broke her wrap around me and I lowered myself just above
her pussy. I gave her a kiss on her pussy lips and I licked of her
pre-cum off. She moaned and she arched her back. She
thought that I was going to lick her but I was just teasing her.

<Misato>: What an asshole!

I licked at the bottom of the whip cream line. Every couple of
inches my mouth was full of whip cream so I had to swallow it.

<Duo>: Or, you could just let it run out of your mouth and play
"rabid dog".

She was loving every second of this and so was I. After I licked
her belly button clean I had to spray some more whip cream
and I had to lick of more. It made her giggle and it made her
very, very erotic.

<Ken>: Adjectives he doesn't know how to use!  Sex he doesn't
know the mechanics of!  Grammar he doesn't even seem to know about!  
Is there anything this guy DOES know?

After I licked her belly button clean like 4 times I slowly started
to lick higher and higher.

I got to the valley between her breast and my dick was
beating faster than my heart. I wanted to be in her so bad.
I liked between her breast for a while and then she started
to tell me something.

<Misato, as Sasami>: Get the FUCK off of me, please!

"Gene Please stop teasing me" She said, she sounded like she
was begging for me. "I need you now Gene PLEASE"

"Ok but if this hurts please tell me" I said to her.

She wrapped her legs around me and I kneeled.
I grabbed my dick with my right hand and I placed it a little
into her pussy lips. I put it deep enough to fell her hymen.

<Cyrus>: "Fell her hymen"?  Is he cutting it down, or something?
<Duo, as Gene>: TIM-BER!

I laid on top of her and she digged her nails into my back
she was nervous that it would hurt and I was nervous that
I would hurt her too.

I started to move my hips forward and closer to her hips. I felt
my dick piercing into her. 

<Ken>: Piercing?  Did he sharpen it or something?
<Kiyone>: I'd like to sharpen it.  With a nail file.

I pushed harder and harder and she begged me to push harder. She 
didn't want to stop now.

<Cyrus>: As opposed to everyone else, I suppose.

I pushed harder and harder. I felt like my dick was about
to break but then suddenly I ripped her.

<Duo>: Geezus, is her hymen reinforced with concrete or
something?

"Ohh" She cried and a few tears came down her cheeks.
I stopped to check on her but before I saw able to say anything
she said "Don't slow down, this is so much fun. And very
kinky"

<Misato>: Yeah, the blood.  And the pain.  All so kinky.

"Ok well if anything feels wrong tell me ok?" I said to her.

I must have been a fool because I totally forgot how good
her tight pussy felt. I moved my hips back and forth really slowly
and I felt her muscles closing tightly around the shaft of my
dick. She was pulling me in. So I went in. Her warm pre-cum
made her pussy smooth.

"Oh oh oh oh oh oh Gene" She said " I love you Gene and I
want you deep inside me Gene"

<Kiyone>: Oh oh oh oh.  This is so not erotic.

"I love you more and I never want to break apart" I told her.

"Gene something is happening" She said she was in so much
pleasure but she tried to look worried.

<Misato, as Sasami>: I think I'm realizing how sick this is.

"Whats wrong?" I asked her

"I feel like I'm going to explode Gene I don't know what
to do" She said.

<Duo>: Oh, goddammit, could you at least give us a chance
to forget that you're nailing an eight-year old?

"Let it out, Im going to cum too I'm just about to reach
my climax" I told her. Then I finally cummed. I moaned
a little.

"Oh GEEEEENNNNNEEEE" She said as she was gasping
for air. I could see that she was so relieved. " We have to do
some more of that tomorrow night"

<Duo, as Sasami>: We can celebrate my ninth birthday!

I could feel her cum surrounding my dick. Then I removed my
dick out of her and I cummed all over her legs. I did the same
thing with Kyone and Washu but I cummed in their asses. When
I pulled out she didn't even notice.

<Kiyone>: Yeah, I bet she didn't notice when you put it in,
either.

"Yeah and we will do different positions and we'll do foreplay
too!" I said all excited. I was out of breath.

<Misato>: Ah, youthful exuberance.  Like, say, an eight-year-old
would have.

"Other positions?" she asked gasping for air.

"Yeah lots" I said. Then I slowly moved down for a kiss.

"Gene, before you cummed you pulled your penis out. Why
did you do that?" She asked

<ALL>: STOP REITERATING THAT SHE'S AS EXPERIENCED AS AN 
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD AT SEX!

*SHIIIIIT* I thought. Then I told her "Well I didn't want you
to get pregnant. I'll do it in you when we get some special pills
from Washu"

"Ohh Gene" She said. Then I laid down next to her and she put
her head on chest. "You care too much for me"

<Misato>: Yeah, not wanting to get you pregnant so he'll be forced
to stay with you out of duty to the child.  He cares so much.

"That's cause I love you" I said. Then I slowly reached for the box
of strawberries and said "Lets eat these while they are fresh"

She then raised herself and put her head on the pillow beside
mine. 

<Ken>: Did she lop it off, or something?

I slowly put a strawberry in her mouth (The stem parts
were cut of).

When it was in her mouth she let out a  little "MMMMmmmm"
Then she sucked on my fingers and licked them clean.

<Kiyone, yelling>: END!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE JUST
END!

We fed each other the strawberries. She sucked and licked
my fingers clean and I sucked and licked her fingers clean.
After we finished the strawberries we felt kind of dirty.

<Cyrus>: Join the club.

"Gene my legs are too sticky, I wont be able to fall asleep"
she said.

Then I looked at her legs and I touched my sticky cum.
"Opps sorry" I said

<Duo, as Gene>: I didn't mean to accidentally put my dick in
you, and push it in and out, then ejaculate.  My bad.

"Its ok Gene" She said while she ran her fingers up and down
my chest.

"Hey lets go take a shower together, and then we can have some
foreplay sex. If you have the energy for it. Plus we have rested
for enough time to have sex again" 

<Misato>: I don't know, I get the feeling that this is one of 
those purely physical relationships.

I said. I was getting really excited.

"Ok sounds like fun Gene" She said. I can hear her voice getting
a little excited.

<Duo, as Sasami>: Wanna play hopscotch afterwards?

We both got up quietly and I gave her one of my bath robes.
We put on the bath ropes and I checked my watch and it was
nearly 2 am.

I opened the door and checked to see if anyone was around.

<Cyrus, as Gene>: Hmmm...Washu, Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Mihoshi, 
Tenchi, Kiyone...coast is clear!  Let's go!

"Ok lets go" I said.

I held her hand and we walked into the bathroom. We went into
the male one because someone could have been in the hot spring.

<Ken>: Is spontaneous early morning bathing a big problem in
this house?

I locked the door behind me and she turned on the shower. She
took her robe of and I quickly did the same. We both hopped into
the shower and started to kiss and shove each others tongues
down our throats.

<Duo>: Oh, I see.  It's Gene Simmons from KISS.  That explains
how the tongue gets down her throat.

 The steam of the warm water quickly fogged
the room.

"It time for some foreplay" I said while I raised my right eyebrow.

<Cyrus>: Um...you do that before sex.  Hence the "fore-" prefix.

She smiled and she nodded her head. I kneeled down in the
shower and I kissed her pussy. I opened her lips with my hand
and I started to lick inside her. She moaned in please and put her
hands behind my head. She shoved my head into her pussy.

<Duo>: WOAH!  That's some elasticity.

I licked further and further. I could feel her body shake with
please and she said "Its happening Gene. You don't have to
drink it"

I said "But I want to, I want you inside me forever"

<Ken>: There is so much wrong with that on so many levels.  But
in the interest of brevity, I won't point them all out.

Her pussy muscles squeezed around the sides of my tongue
and sucked me in deeper. I felt it twitch. She moaned. Then
she started to cum and I started to drink. Her semen was
so warm and so sweet. 

<Misato>: SEMEN?  Did she just change sexes?

She kept on shooting her loads into my mouth and I kept on 
drinking. 

<Duo>: Um...okay...did he just...wait a second...but she's...
<Ken>: Pause for a second, Duo.  Think.  Think.
<Duo>: Okay.  I just want to state, for the record, that this
guy seems to base all lemon scenes around his experience
sucking cock.

I licked her totally clean and gave her a little kiss on the 
pussy lips.

"You should shave that pussy hair sometime." I said in a joke
way.

"Thank you Gene and I'll do anything you want." She said as I
slowly got up.

<Kiyone>: Geez.  She's already his bitch.

I gave her a kiss and then she slowly kneeled down. The warm
water was spraying on my chest and Sesami was starting to play
around with my dick. My dick hardened straight away, and she
started to drewl at the site of my dick right in front of her.

<Kiyone>: Wait, I need to correct myself.  She's a slut.

She put her right hand around the shaft of my dick and she
was cupping my balls with her left hand. She kept on gently
squeezing and messaging my balls.

<Misato>: Man.  How does heterosexual sex come off as so gay
in this fic?
<Cyrus>: I think it has something to do with the fact that the
only thing this guy can write even semi-decently at all is
cocksucking.  Like he's experienced, or something.

She slowly started to move her small hand up and down my dick.
The felling of her soft hand, messaging of my balls and the warm
water on my upper body nearly made me explode right there.

<Kiyone>: Yes!  Blow up!  Die!  End the wretched fic!

She saw that in my face and she put my dick in her mouth.
"MMmmmm Taste so good" She said with a full mouth
of my dick.

<Ken>: Can she throw her voice?
<Duo, as Sasami>: For my next act, I'm going to sing "Last Rose
of Summer" while swallowing this cock!

Her mouth was warm and wet. I felt her little tongue running
from side to side of my dick. She was desperate to take in
more of my dick. So she put her hands on my ass and she moved
her head closer and closer to the bottom of my dick.

<Misato>: Geez.  What a goddamn slut.  You wouldn't even remember
that she's EIGHT YEARS OLD.

I wasn't able to put my dick in her all the way so I needed to know
if she could do it. She put my entire dick in her mouth and made
little vacuum noises.

I can tell you that she sucked me like one too. The feeling
was like total ecstasy.

<Ken>: It was like it.  But not really.  Just similar.

I started to cum into her mouth. She didn't know what to
do so she started to swallow my cum. I was some of it spilling
out of her mouth and down her chin. I kept on cumming and
cumming.

"MMmmm more Gene" She said until I was dried out.

<Duo>: *coughSLUTcough*

"How did you like that Sesami?" I asked her with my smile
from ear to ear.

"I loved it!" She said.

<Duo>: I repeat: *coughSLUTcough*

We washed each other clean with soap, shampoo and
conditioner. We got out and went back to my room. Since
we had sex on top of the sheet the underneath was clean.

<Cyrus>: Yeah.  Thank God liquids don't travel through
fabric, or anything.

I took off my robe and climbed under my covers. I laid down
and watched her slowly strip off the robe. Then she slowly
came down and laid by my side. We put our arm around each
other and she wrapped her legs around my body. My dick was
pressed by her pussy.

<All>: NO!  NO MORE SEX SCENES!

"Thank you for everything Gene" Sesami said.

"No I should be thanking you. Next time we will be using many
different techniques and maybe some leather with a whip!"
I said

<Kiyone>: Or a noose!  Or a shotgun!  Or arsenic!

"A WHIP?" She said really confused.

"Hehehe just joking" I said. Then we slowly kissed each other
and fell asleep by each others side.

<Cyrus>: How amazingly unromantic.

~~~~~~~~~THE END~~~~~~~~~~~~

So what did you all think?

<Ken, as the Critic>: It stinks.

I think thats my best one yet but I have some crazy ideas for the
future stories and some people make a huge come back!!

<Cyrus>: Like Azaka?  Or Kamidake?  Both of whom you callously
and offhandedly killed?  YOU BASTARD!  IF I EVER FIND YOU, I'LL
KILL YOU!

E-mail me and tell me what you thought of the story
CMDR_DUFF@YAHOO.COM
dont forget vote for me!

<Kiyone>: Yeah!  Mr. Sinister for President!  Of a small Balkan
nation that's about to be bombed out of existence, preferably.
<Cyrus>: Alright, back to the hot springs!

____________________________________________________________________

And now, the dramatic conclusion of...
THE OBLIGATORY HOT SPRINGS EPISODE!

	This time, all of our MSTers had gathered in the same onsen,
in order to better discuss the fic.  They were wearing bathing
suits, of course.  To prevent an orgy from breaking out, because
nobody wants another goddamned lemon scene at this point.
	"So, how was the fic?" Cyrus asked.
	"GIVE ME MY GODDAMNED ALCOHOL!" yelled Kiyone.
	"That good, huh?" asked Cyrus.
	"Well, I liked how the author didn't seem to stop reiterating
that Sasami was pretty much 8 goddamned years old throughout the
lemon scene.  That was very tasteful, you fucker," Duo said.
	"I agree," said Misato.
	"That it was very tasteful?" asked Cyrus.
	"No, that you should GIVE US THE GODDAMNED ALCOHOL!" she 
yelled.
	"Okay, okay.  I guess if you want to get liquored up and
discover then next morning that you slept with Duo and Ken and God
forbid me, it's your perogative."
	Misato and Kiyone looked at each other, then looked at the
bottle of alcohol, then back at each other again.
	"Don't worry, I'll make sure you don't sleep with any of 
them," came a voice from behind them.
	"Yay!" said the girls as they leapt at the alcohol to drink
away the pain of the fic.
	Cyrus looked at the speaker and swore.
	"Fucking plot device."
