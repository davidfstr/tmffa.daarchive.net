A SONGFIC-OF-A-RANT
BY 
THE PSYCHOMATIC POET

DISCLAIMER: NOTHING HERE BELONGS TO ME EXCEPT FOR THE 
	    CHANGES MADE TO RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE'S 
	    SONG "KNOW YOUR ENEMY" AND MY THOUGHTS. 
	    RAGE ON, BROTHAS, RAGE ON.

=================================================================================================

KNOW YOUR ENEMY

Born with insight and a raised fist
A witness to the bad fic
As we move into the next millenium
What I wouldn't give to destroy them  
Ya got to know
Ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify
Defy
I'm a writer with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We won't read the fics
We'll MST'em

Something must be done
About vengeance, a grudge and my fun
'Cause I'll rip the keys, rip the screen, rip the Pentium
I was born to rage against'em

Fist in ya face, in the place
And I'll drop the style clearly
Know your enemy

Word is born
Fight the lemons, fuck the porn
Now I got no patience
So sick of their complacence
With the D E F I A N C E
Mind of a revolutionary
So clear the lane
I'm gonna be every bloody pervert's bane
What? The lemon's for free?
Whoever wrote that shit is my enemy

Something must be done
About vengeance, a grudge and my fun
'Cause I'll rip the keys, rip the screen, rip the Pentium
I was born to rage against'em

Now action must be taken
We won't read the shit
We'll blast'em

I've got no patience now
So sick of their complacence now
I've got no patience now
So sick of their complacence now
Sick of sick of sick of sick of sick of you
Time has come to PAY

Yes I know my enemies
They're the lemon writers who bullshitted me
Hentais, pornography, degradation, perversion
Ignorance, hypocrisy, sick mentality, the pieces-a-shit
All of which are not my anime dreams	  

=================================================================================================

The Poet speaks: Why did I write this songfic-of-a-rant? Personally, 
		 I've got nothing against the good lemon writers 
		 out there who have chronicled the intimate FEELINGS 
		 involved in their lemons rather than concentrate 
		 on the sex acts performed. They know who they are.
		 The bastards I'm raging against are those who have 
		 advocated pedophilia, incest, bestiality and mindless 
		 sex orgies in their piece-a-shit fics. Likewise, 
		 they know who they are. But...if you'd like a list, 
		 go to K'thardin and Navaash's TMFF review site and 
		 read the reviews on the bastards who have received 
		 the MISA Award. Then, you'd probably understand what 
		 I'm rage-ranting about. The ignorance,the hypocrisy, 
		 the complacence; the degrading things they put the 
		 TM characters through; I'M FREAKING SICK  AND TIRED 
		 OF IT!!!!!!! As Asuka puts it in my very first MST: 
		 "Be afraid lemon writers, be very afraid..." 

The Poet pays tribute:  With this songfic, I'd also like to pay tribute 
			to Rage Against The Machine; for being who they 
			are and for not letting the System push them about. 
			Thanks for showing me the way to rebel against 
			the System, comrades. I hope that I didn't shit 
			your song. 
			
			Rage on, brothas, rage on.
