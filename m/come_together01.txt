Interview one of "COME TOGETHER"

	
"Hey is this the right place?" A boy asked from the small crowd 
of 30 kids that approached a black mailbox.

	Another boy looked at the numbers on the mailbox and then looked 
at the numbers written on the slip of paper. "34843. Yep this is it."

	"Wow! I can't believe we are actually going to meet the one and 
only, Space Virgin Cabbit in person! " Exclaimed a girl clutching a 
Ryo-Ohki plush toy in her arms.

	"Yea." Replied the rest of the crowd as they made their way up to 
large house with lavender shutters pink bricks and blue trim.

	"I wonder if that's his car?" Asked another boy, pointing to a 
sparkling blue painted 1979 Oldsmobile on chrome rims. 

"Cool man that's awesome." Said another boy wearing a T-shirt 
with Mew two on the front.

"Hey you guys can you tell me what Space Virgin Cabbit looks 
like? Asked a girl with meatballs in her hair."

"Naw, nobody hasn't even seen his face until now." Responded 
another girl with red earrings."

The rest of the crowd stopped at the door.

"Well now this is it. We'll be the first ones to hear what 
happens next in COME TOGETHER." Said a boy with Dragon Ball Z shorts.

	He rang the doorbell a few times.

	Suddenly the door opened.

	A man in his early thirties with a goatee appeared. He looked at 
the large crowd not to mention that a few more last minute kids were 
heading up the driveway panting for breath.

	"Um Hey." He said

	"Are you Space Virgin Cabbit?" Asked a girl with big brown eyes.

	The man was about to reply when I called out. "Its Ok Rob they're 
expected. Let them in."

	The kids moved into the house and they bent down and took off 
their shoes and socks. They put them by the door and made their way 
down the hall and into the back room. In the room I was sitting on the 
floor holding my small Calico cat in my arms.

	 I have black hair and green eyes. I had on glasses, a red T-
shirt, a silver chain with a silver cross around my neck a silver ring 
with a black jewel on my left hand, black shorts a red string bracelet 
on my right ankle and I was barefoot like them.

	I turned and looked at the many Anime fans. They ranged from 
Tenchi to Ranma, to Dragon Ball, to Gundams, to Zoids, to Cowboy Bebop, 
to Outlaw Star to Sailor Moon.

	"I'm Space Virgin Cabbit." I replied, stroking the cat's chin.

	Suddenly a girl that looked very much like a teen version of 
Mihoshi stepped out of the crowd and gave me a large hug.

	"Wow your cute!" She exclaimed giving him a kiss on his cheek.

	I blushed as a few more girls hugged me while other boys shook my 
hand.

	"All right it looks like every one of you has received my 
invitation for the interview of COME TOGETHER."	

The fans nodded in unison.

	"Have a seat and we'll get started."

	Everybody sat down in his or her place. The Mihoshi look alike 
and the girl with the meatballs in her hair came and sat by me.

	I cleared my throat and started talking.

	"Now as you know I've been making a fan fic called COME TOGETHER. 
I started out at first as a false name called Michael Caddyman Vidrine. 
I sent my demo chapter "The Accident" to Gensao's Tenchi Muyo fanfic 
archive. It got fair reviews but it wasn't a hit yet. The Accident was 
never meant to be a (Introduction Chapter) instead it took off pretty 
quick because the love Yosho had for Ayeka was slowly being revealed. 

	"A few months later I revised my chapter one and signed my real 
name SPACE VIRGIN CABBIT to it."

	"In just one week I received a sprawling amount of positive 
reviews and each one was begging me for more."

	The cat had now fallen asleep between my legs since I was sitting 
in Indian style position.

	"Afterwards I wrote the second chapter of Come Together Mihoshi's 
Friend which had a different twist because it involved someone people 
from two other universes aka Outlaw Star and Cowboy Bebop. It could 
never be Kiyone because well Kiyone still can't stand her although some 
fan fic writers portray them as a lesbian or bisexual couple." 

	"As the same as the first chapter it got great reviews. After 
that I wrote the other chapter Royal Brother and Sister. A lot of 
people liked that cause someone like me went out of their way to write 
an Ayeka and Yosho relationship."

	"However although I promised to write a fourth Chapter "Juri 
Training", instead I quit for a while. No I will not break that promise 
because I have been writing the ideas that have been coming into my 
head except that I haven't put them together in chapters."

	"Now that I have given you a brief summary of the following 
chapters you may ask your questions."

	Suddenly everybody in the room raised their hands. I pointed at a 
boy with a Goku style hair.

	"Hey anybody else beside Ayeka and Yosho going to fall in love?"

	"Yes every single person will be involved in a relationship."

	I pointed to another boy with a Liger Zero T-shirt.

	"Is the story going to focus on certain people and use the rest 
as underdogs?"

	"Good question. No every character will have its fair share of 
being involved in the story. However some characters I will remove and 
put back later but they will be involved, just not used as much as 
others.

	I pointed to a girl with spiky pink hair.

	"You said every single person will be involved in a relationship, 
so who is Washu going to fall in love with?"

	"Sorry I can't tell you that, because that is one of the secrets 
to my story." I said with a grin.

	I pointed to a girl with a Sailor Moon purse.

	"Um, Why are you called SPACE VIRGIN CABBIT?"

	"Because I like anime which represents (SPACE). I haven't had sex 
with anybody, which represents (VIRGIN). And I like Ryo-Ohki, which 
represents (CABBIT)"

	I pointed to a girl that looked similar to sailor Uranus.

	"Are they're going to be any homosexual relationships?"

	"Um, maybe." I replied while blushing.

I then pointed to a girl with Bulma style hair.

	"Will Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball GT be involved?"

	I took a deep breath and replied. "Um I'm sorry but no. And 
here's why. So many DBZ fans have wrote so much stories that have 
proved that Super Sayins are much more powerful than light hawk wings. 
Besides they get in the way and cause major destruction which in turn 
will force me to write about fights and fights and fights! Plus I want 
to focus mostly on original ideas, not recycled ideas that have been 
used for other fan fics.

	"Aw man." She responded.

	"Hey buck up Dragon Ball Z or GT won't be involved but Dragon 
Ball, just Dragon Ball will be." I said with a grin.

	"YAHOO!" She cried while giving me a hug. Oh thank you Space 
Virgin Cabbit! Thank you!"

	After she sat back down, I pointed to a boy that had a black T-
shirt on.

	"Have you been writing any chapters down but, you haven't post 
them yet?"

	"Yes in fact I'm almost done with Juri Training. Other Chapters 
are still in the works."

	I pointed to a boy with aqua blue hair.

	"Are Tenchi and Ryoko going to get together?"

	"I'm not going to answer that question either."

	I pointed to a girl that looked similar to Suzuka.

	"Since Jim and Aisha showed up in Chapter 2, so will they be 
involved permanently?"

	"Uh I think so."

	 I pointed to a boy that had a Digimon T-shirt on 

"Which shows will be involved in your story?"

"Hmm Good question I haven't decided that yet. But I know that 
Tenchi Muyo, Dragon Ball, Outlaw Star, and Cowboy Bebop, will be there. 
As for the others like Zoids, Sailor Moon, Ramna or any others I just 
don't know."      

I pointed to the girl with the meatballs in her hair. 

"Can you tell us anything else about your up coming fan fic 
chapters?"

"There isn't much I can tell you except that just keep on reading 
my first three Chapters and try to make some predictions about what 
happens next."

I pointed to girl that was holding the Ryo-Ohki plush toy in her 
arms.

"What made you choose Aisha Clan Clan for Mihoshi's friend?"

"Well I've been a fan of Outlaw Star since it premiered on 
Toonami. She is my favorite character on that show. When I was in the 
middle of writing chapter one. I had already thought of who was going 
to be Mihoshi's friend. Like I said before it couldn't Kiyone, so I 
decided to look for someone that had a lot of features similar to 
Mihoshi. Then when I saw Aisha Clan Clan it hit me. Aisha had the same 
skin, height and eye color. So I chose to make her Mihoshi's friend and 
immediately I began writing a past about them. And that's basically how 
it started." 

I pointed to a boy with fake tattoo of Oo-Long on his right 
wrist.

"Why did you quit writing for a while? Did you get writter's 
block or something?"

"Well yes because not only I had writter's block but because 
school got in the way. I went through a LOT of hell last summer when I 
got in a car wreck and had to have surgery on my face. I looked 
terrible. Plus I took Softball that year until I had to resign right 
before the last game of the season because of my injuries and

   "Hey! Its time for dinner, young man." Called a young woman in 
her late thirties.

"Aw!" Groaned the crowd of anime fans as they started to get up.

"Hey don't worry I'll send you an invitation for another 
interview later on." I reassured them.

	The crowd came by and hugged me or shook my hand.

	"Oh and don't tell nobody. This is between all of you and me." I 
said winking.

	"Ok" Everyone called while putting his or her shoes back on and 
exiting out of the house.

	END OF INTERVIEW ONE
