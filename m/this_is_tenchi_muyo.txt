Everyone is eating a classic Sasami made dinner when suddenly Ryoko leaps out of her

chair and kisses Tenchi.  Although surprised at first gets into it and wraps his arms

around Ryoko (apparently she's good at this).

Aeka:  Get off of Lord Tenchi you monster

Tenchi:  Shut the hell up Aeka, can't you see I hate you and love Ryoko?

Aeka: Lord Tenchi? *Cue the puppy-dog eyes and tears*

Ryoko: Give it up he loves me

Aeka: No he doesn't!

Ryoko:  Are you blind?

Aeka:  No I'm just a stupid stuck-up princess who needs a man!!!

Tenchi:  I guess I'll have to end this *forms light hawk wings and cuts Aeka's head off*

      Everyone cheers and finishes their meals telling Sasami what a great job they did.

      Ryoko and Tenchi get married the next day as Aeka rots in hell Hurrah!!!!
