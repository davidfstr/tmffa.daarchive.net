Tokimi’s Song - Rubbish

Adapted by: Zylle

Look at me, a shining star
A perfect piece of Heaven
I have come so far
And I’m waving it around

Pre-Chorus:
I am fruitful, I am wise
Trees of Knowledge in my eyes
You should see how I live my life
When I’m faithful, grateful...

Chorus:
Rubbish, only
Trash in tranquility, it’s
Rubbish, only
Garbage in the garden

I have gained righteousness
Putting in my time
Just myself to impress
But it’s all worth while

Pre-Chorus

Chorus

Amidst my waste, I have no place
For me to say that I am good
Amidst my waste, it’s foolish
Not to know it all is just...

Chorus
