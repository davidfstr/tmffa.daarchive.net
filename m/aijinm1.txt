            Aijin Muyo! #1: No Need for a Story! - The MSTing
                          (Hentai Muyo OVA #2)

[OPENING SONG - "One More Minute" by Weird Al Yankovic]

Pocket Dimension #3306 - Don Euclid's Theatre
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projection Booth.  Don 
Euclid, instead of wearing his normal tuxedo, is wearing a hideous neon-
green lab coat and matching glasses.]

Girlish Voice: That beer acted just as I thought it would.  Thank you
               for your cooperation, Don.
Don Euclid: (grinning) Don't mention it.  By the way, what's in that
            stuff that makes these people act so stupid?
Girlish Voice: Mihoshi's pheromones.
Don Euclid: (smile fading) You said you wouldn't do anything too brutal,
            Washu.  I need them alive to keep MSTing.
Washu: Don't worry about it.  Despite a few side effects, they'll be
       just fine.
Don Euclid: (sweating) Side effects?

[Scene: The Theatre's interior.  Our four intrepid MSTers are sitting
on the couch, looking bored.]

Pixy Misa: (yelling up at the Booth) Hey, Don!  When's the next flick
           coming on?  I wanna see Piccolo barf again!
Piccolo: (shaking with anger) I'm about to go medieval on your...
Don Euclid's Voice: (from the Theatre's speakers)  Cool down.  The next
                    film is about ready to go.  After the invention
                    exchange, that is.
Misato: (skeptically) Invention exchange?  You'd think this was Mystery
        Science Theatre 3000 or something.

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projection Booth.  Don 
grins evilly and flips a switch, projecting an image of himself and 
Washu onto the screen.]

Don Euclid: How did you guess, Captain?

[Scene: The Theatre's interior.  A moment of stunned silence, then all 
of the characters simultaneously leap up and begin throwing power bolts, 
firing pistols, and yelling vulgarisms at the Booth.  Nothing even 
damages the walls of the Theatre.]

Don Euclid's Voice: (smugly) Don't even bother.  This entire theatre is
                    sealed off.  Nothing can come in.  Nothing can go
                    out.
Fujisawa: (angrily) Oh, yeah?  What about Kamidake?
DE's Voice: (nervously) A... fluke.  Yes.  A fluke.  Now, as I was
            saying, nothing comes in, nothing goes out.  All of you are
            stuck here for as long as I choose to keep you!
Piccolo: (muttering) We'll see about that.
DE's Voice: Now, about that invention exchange...

[Five minutes later...]

Washu's Voice: And so that is my invention this week, the Subatomic
               Neutron Polarizer.  Elegant in it's simplicity, is it
               not?
DE's Voice: (yawning) Yes, very interesting, Washu.  Now let me wake
            up them up and we'll see what they have to present.
Washu's Voice: (angrily) They fell asleep?!
DE's Voice: Well, yes.  I mean...
Washu's Voice: (sulkily) Humph.
DE's Voice: Wakey wakey!  Rise and shine!  What have you got for us?

[It takes a couple of minutes for the crew to recover from Washu's 
deadly lecture, then they group into a huddle.  A few seconds later, 
Misato emerges, carrying a package.]

Misato: I proudly present, the crown jewel of NERV technology, the
        Bunny Plug!  *She withdraws a small tube, maybe about the size
        of her hand, from the package.*  Ta-daa!
DE's Voice; Don't you mean the DUMMY plug?
Misato: Nope.  The Bunny Plug.  It's the size of two Energizer batteries
        put together and was created to act as a substitute for D cells.
DE's Voice: (skeptically) Side effects?
Misato: (agitated) Well, probably the same as the Dummy Plug.
DE's Voice: You mean a rabid, berserk Energizer Bunny?
Misato: (angrily) Shut up, you... you...
Piccolo: Sorry excuse for a Dr. Forrester wanna-be?
Misato: Yeah!
DE's Voice: (smugly) You wound me, sir.  Oh, look.  It must be time for
            our feature.  *Abruptly, the projection of Don Euclid and a
            sulking Washu disappears from the screen.  The interior of
            the Theatre grows dark.*

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projection Booth.  Don 
Euclid is evilly readying a fresh spool of film.  Washu still looks 
angry, but a bit less than before.]

Washu: Oh, I suppose they'll be calling me "TV's Washu" now.
Don Euclid: (getting the film ready) But you're the version from the
            OVA's, though.
Washu: (perplexed) Wha?
Don Euclid: Never mind.  *He activates the projector with the flip of a
            switch.*  Might as well sit down and watch them squirm.  I
            believe you're still working on that "Hentai Quotient"
            theory of yours.  It might just be a good study.
Washu: (warming a bit and whipping out a notebook.)  Oh, yeah.

[Scene: The Theatre's interior.  The fic is just beginning.]

Misato: There is DEFINATELY no need for this story!

>All characters used in this story don't belong to me(as if you didn't

Pixy Misa: Thank God.

>already know this) I just chose to use them in this story....
>This story is written for all the fans of Tenchi Muyo! This is the way 

Fujisawa: (skeptically) All of them?
Pixy Misa: They can't all be that hentai, can they?
Misato: They wouldn't write if they didn't have an audience.
Piccolo: (cracking his knuckles) I'd like to meet this... audience.

>we really wanted to see them and as some of us have in our dreams! 

All: (singing conga line-style) Lo-li-con no Hen-TAI!

>Meaning This has the standard "LEMON" warning that we've all come to

Fujisawa: This author is making way too many assumptions here.
Misato: Agreed.  Lemons I don't mind, but this...
Piccolo: This is different.

>This is a lemon fan-fic... your here so you know what your doing. 
>If for some reason you are reading this and you are not at least 18

Pixy Misa: Not only is he into Lolicon, he's also into spanking!
Misato: (warningly) You had better not have sounded as excited about
        that as I just thought you did.
Pixy Misa: (innocently) Who, me?
Piccolo: (snickering) Who else around here is wearing leather?

Piccolo: I'm gonna find JARR and send him into an alternate dimension.
Fujiaawa: Excuse me?  A what?
Piccolo: (embarassed) I forgot, this isn't American TV.
Pixy Misa: (taunting) Piccolo got censored!  Piccolo got censored!

>***********************************************************************

Fujisawa: My God, it's full of stars...  *The others groan loudly.*

>                          (this story is a Sasami extreme production)

Piccolo: How can it get more "extreme" than the last one?
Pixy Misa: (mulling it over) Perhaps a lesbian scene...
Misato: (shocked) Misa!
Fujisawa: (groaning) Great, last thing we need - another Alliel...

>        It all started on a peaceful summer morning at the Masaki 
>shrine.  The birds chirping softly in the cool autumn air. Everyone in 

Piccolo: Why is it every single damn Tenchi fanfic, lemon or otherwise,
         begins with a "peaceful morning"?
Fujisawa: Maybe you were expecting loud explosions and chaos at six
          in the AM?
Piccolo: (defensively) Well, it always happens that way on my world!
Pixy Misa: That figures.

>the Masaki house was in a hurry for one reason or another. Ryoko 
>noticing Tenchi from across the room, flies over with an evil smirk on 
>her face.

Misato: I'm still curious how Tenchi has managed to resist her for as
        long as he has.  I mean, he's got 17-year old hormones!
Fujisawa: (proudly) It's all of matter of willpower.  It's not all
          that hard, really.
Piccolo: (smirking) Just like you resisted Miz? 
Fujisawa: (blushing) Well, that's different...

>        "Tenchi..." Ryoko said as slowly as she appeared reaching
>around his shoulders in a passionate embrace. Her large breasts pressed
>against his back. Tenchi obviously nervous, as usual, as his mouth hung
>open and face starting to turn shades of red. Than gathering back his

Misato & Pixy Misa: Go get him, Ryoko!
Fujisawa: Now, ladies...
Piccolo: (interrupting) Yeah, go for it!
Misato: (blinking) Piccolo, you're...
Piccolo: (grinning evilly) She's my kind of lady!  Tough, powerful, and
         never lets anything get in her way!
Pixy Misa: (teasing) I think you have a crush on her!
Piccolo: (grin fading) NO!  I mean...
Fujisawa: (shrugs) I can't blame you.  But I think she's taken.
Piccolo: (angry) Now, wait a damn minute...

>senses he said
>"Ryoko... stop that. I've got a lot of errands to run for grampa while 
>he's away at the shrine." obviously annoyed by the beautiful demons 
>advances. Ryoko not seeming to care about Tenchi's problems, reaches 
>down towards his pants while laughing in a low and sadistic tone. 

Pixy Misa: I don't think Piccolo would be annoyed by the "beautiful
           demon's advances".  Ne, Piccolo?  Ne?
Piccolo: (growling) I never said I was...
Misato: (grinning) Don't worry about it, loverboy.
Fujisawa: (to Pixy Misa, sternly) And you better settle down!  *To
          this, Pixy Misa sticks her tongue out at Fujisawa then
          crosses her arms in front of her in a sulk.*

>        Ayeka turns from a doorway just in time to notice what was 
>going on. She ran over and pushed Ryoko off of Tenchi.

Pixy Misa: ...and then jumped on him herself!
Fujisawa: (jumping up) SUPER FUJISAWA GAG!  *He leaps on Pixy Misa.
          When the dust clears, Pixy Misa is bound and gagged within
          an inch of her life, only her eyes visible.*
Piccolo: (smiling) Much better.  *He settles back on the couch.*
Pixy Misa: (struggling with the bonds) mmmmMMMMPH!

>        "M.. Mi.. Miss Ryoko" she yelled " Just what do you think you 
>were doing to Lord Tenchi!"

Misato: (Brain impression) What we do every peaceful morning, Pinky.

>        Ryoko just looked at the hysterical princess and smiled with an 
>evil grin. " I thought it was pretty obvious" she said sarcastically " 
>but I guess that Jurains must not be as bright as they claim to be!"        

Fujisawa: Doesn't this qualify as highly generic dialogue?
Misato: You got it.  But what do you expect from a Sasami lemon writer?

>        With that their eyes locked on to one another, sparks flying 
>everywhere, as the two women just growled lightly. They quickly started 
>fighting, throwing each other around while Tenchi tried in vain to get 
>clear, getting his face smashed from both of the beautiful combatants. 

Piccolo: (Mean Gene impression) And now, the two lady titans of the
         ring, Princess "Mad Dog" Ayeka and the Ravishing Ryoko!
Fujisawa: And it's a body slam!  Then a piledriver!  Ooh, look!  Ref,
          wake up!  The Princess has an illegal weapon!
Misato: It's... it's... a leather bullwhip!
All: (cringing) Aiiieeee!

>Mihoshi stood there in shock at the mess they just made. Sasami 

Piccolo: Mihoshi... shocked?
Misato: Strange.  She's usually the first person to get up and do
        something stupid to make the situation worse.

>stepping in the doorway from the kitchen cried out in here soft and 
>gentle voice "Tenchi!" she ran over to him to see if he was still 
>alive. She looked into his eyes as he opened them. he smiled which put 
>Sasami's mind at ease, she quickly raised her head with a look of 
>strong anger.  "Now look what you did. This is all your fault. You two 
>are always causing problems for Tenchi!" her voice as angry as she can 
>make it "Now both of you get out and leave Tenchi alone!"

Fujisawa: Gee, a bit out of character, don't ya think?
Misato: Yeah.  I thought she knew it was futile to try and stop `em.
All: (singing) Ya gotta keep `em seperated...

>        Neither Ayeka or Ryoko even noticed Sasami's speech over their 
>fighting, on coincidence the two of them still arguing took their fight 
>outside, almost forgetting what they were fighting over, they were just 
>use to always fighting about something.

Pixy Misa: (finally out of her bonds and glaring at Fujisawa)  Why'd
           you do that?!
Fujisawa: (patiently) Because when you start getting more hentai than
          the story already is, we're all in deep trouble.
Pixy Misa: (sheepishly) Oh.

>        "Are you all right?" Sasami asked quietly. Tenchi smiled at the 
>blue hared girl that kneeled beside him " I'll be alright thanks to 
>you."

Piccolo: (Mimicking Sasami's high-pitched voice)  Oh, look!  I saved the
         day again!  *He grimaces.*  Don't make me puke.
Pixy Misa: Not that that's any difficulty.
Piccolo: (growling) Shut up!

>        "That's good." smiling happily back at him helping him to his 
>feet.
>        "I don't know what id do half the time if it weren't for you 
>Sasami." Tenchi said cheerfully. Sasami turned her head and blushed as 
>her ever present smile started to grow. Her heart began to flutter. 

Misato: For starters, the lemons would be much more tasteful...
Piccolo: ...and he'd have to grow a spine...
Fujisawa: ...and learn how to take care of himself.
Pixy Misa: (smirking) What a wuss.

>"Well I've got to get to the store, see you later Sasami" Tenchi said 
>as he walked towards front door. "Hurry back!" she said while waving to 
>him.

Pixy Misa: Yeah, hurry!  The video shoot for "In the Carrot Patch" is
           at noon!
Fujisawa: (angrily) I will gag you again if I have to!

>        After every body left and Sasami finally got done cleaning up 
>Ryoko's and Ayeke's mess, She finally got a chance to relax, and in 
>this house she needed to take advantage of every opportunity she could 
>get. Seeing how she's the one who did all the cooking, dishes, and most 

Pixy Misa: Having a Kasumi-type character around is really convenient,
           isn't it?  Besides, she's a Princess of Jurai!  Where would
           she learn how to cook, clean, and wash dishes?
Misato: You know the drill - smile and nod.

>of the cleaning. Sasami thought she could use a nice relaxing bath.
>        She went upstairs to the bathroom and got undressed, putting on 

Piccolo: (groaning) Here it comes.  I just know it.
Misato: (cautiously) You're not going to lose it again, are you?
Piccolo: (defensively) That... that was a stomach flu!
Pixy Misa: (smugly) Riiiight.

>a towel, as she opened the doorway that Washu had created to keep out 
>Tenchi's father, she could hear a faint sound coming from somewhere in 

Pixy Misa: Come to think of it, why is it there are so many Sasami
           lemons and not a single one featuring Nobuyuki?
Misato: I guess it's more fun for these lemon writers to drag an
        innocent through the mud than it is to use a character who is
        already hentai.
Piccolo: (showing his teeth) Slow and painful, JARR.  Slow and painful.

>the Olympic sized bath tub. It was coming from somewhere in one of the 
>far corners of the massive tub. She quietly snuck over hiding almost 
>voyeuristically behind one of the large boulder that were placed every 
>so often in the warm water.

Fujisawa: (Nobuyuki impression) It would be rude not to peep!
Misato: (shuddering) You do that too well, Fujisawa.

>     (don't ask me why their are boulders... ask Washu it was her idea)
>     Peeking over an edge, making sure not to be seen, she noticed 
>someone.  It was Washu making the noises.. Sasami wondering why she was 

Piccolo: (glancing back towards the Projection Booth) Uh oh.
Misato: What?
Piccolo: What if Washu is still in the booth watching this part?
All: (bigsweating) Oh, shit.

>making those strange noises stood there and just watched her silently 
>and curiously.
>Taking a closer look, Sasami noticed Washu was rubbing back and forth 
>between her legs and fondling her breast. Sasami stood dumbfounded for 

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projection Booth.  Washu 
is looking very angry and is advancing on Don, some sort of futuristic 
weapon in her hands.]

Washu: (sweetly) Tell me you didn't know that scene was in there.
Don Euclid: (shakily) I d-didn't k-k-know...
Washu: (booming) BULLSHIT!  *She cocks the weapon and fires.*

[Scene: The Theatre's interior.  All four characters look nervous.  
Suddenly an explosion rocks the building.  The lights flicker for a 
second, and the picture on the screen winks out.]

Pixy Misa: (nervously) Do you think she...?
Piccolo: (nodding solemnly) Yep.  Euclid's toast.
Fujisawa: Wait, doesn't that mean that we're free to go?
Misato: I don't see any doors opening up.
Pixy Misa: (sighing) Then we're probably still stuck.

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projection Booth.  Don 
Euclid pulls himself up from the floor, blackened and smoking.  The 
projector itself is a total wreck.  Washu is nowhere in sight.]

Don Euclid: (coughing) Damnit, I knew putting Washu into this MSTing
            wouldn't be a good idea.  Now I have to fix this thing.
            *He rubs the burn marks off of his watch and checks the
            time, then brightens.*  At least it's in time for this
            show's guest appearance.

[Scene: The Theatre's Interior.  Boredom has driven the characters into 
playing charades.  Piccolo is up front, miming something.]

Piccolo: (miming vigorously) ...
Misato: Stick?  Umm... staff!  Wait, no.  Rifle?
Fujisawa: Fifth of Jack Daniels?
Pixy Misa: (frightened) Sword!  Sword!
Piccolo: (triumphantly) Yes!  A sword!  Finally!
Pixy Misa: (jumping up and down on the couch)  No!  Sword!  Sword!  
           *About the second Misa finishes shouting, a sword flies out
           of the shadows near the front of the theatre and beans
           Piccolo hilt first.*
Piccolo: (dazedly) Wher'd that Saiyajin come from?
Ominous Voice: Not a Saiyajin, old friend.
Piccolo: (shaking off the impact) Old friend?!  Who in the hell are you?
         *A man steps out of the shadows.  He is tall and pale, with
         his black hair combed back from his head.  He seems to be
         wearing some kind of impenetrable armor.*
Mysterious Man: Recognize me now?
Piccolo: (surprised) Ashram?  Is that you?
Pixy Misa: (staring in adoration)  He's my idol...
Ashram: In the flesh.  *He walks over and retrieves his sword, which is
        VERY big.*  I've come to this pocket dimension to fight a duel
        with some upstart swordsman.  What are you doing here?
Piccolo: (grimacing) We're prisoners of some asshole named Don Euclid
         who thinks he's Doctor Forrester from Mystery Science Theatre
         3000.  He said that this place was supposed to be locked down.
         Nothing gets in, nothing gets out.
Ashram: (smiling mysteriously) Well, I know a few... tricks.  *Another
        figure steps out of the shadows, this time a tall, slender
        Japanese youth dressed in kendo-practice clothing and holding
        a bokken in a practiced grip.*  And there he is now.  I still
        don't understand why you wanted to duel with me, Kuno.
Kuno: (sheepishly) Well, I didn't want to, but it's in my contract
      that I have to challenge anybody who fits the description of
      `obvious evil'.  (shakes head vigorously)  And now you die,
      evil sorceror!  Perish by mine own hand!
Ashram: (rolling his eyes) Bring it on, boy.
Fujisawa: Wait... wait just a minute here.
Both Combatants: (angrily) WHAT?!
Fujisawa: (nervously) N-never mind.  *The combatants turn to regard each
          other.  A few seconds later, Kuno rushes at Ashram screaming
          some kind of battle cry.  He swings mightily... and his bokken
          shatters against Ashram's armor.  He stands there for a brief
          second, looking stupid.  That's how long it takes for Ashram
          to bring Soul Crusher to bear and flick it outwards, easily
          decapitating the unfortunate Takahashite.*
Misato: (casually) I'd give that one about a six.
Fujisawa: (disgusted) How can you watch?
Misato: (dryly) After the "End of Evangelion", I can handle anything.
Pixy Misa: Wow!  *She jumps off of the couch and runs up to Ashram, who
           is cleaning his blade.  She produces a pad of paper and a
           pen, seemingly out of nowhere.*  Oh, wow!  A-ash-a-a...
Ashram: (curiously) Who is this young one, Piccolo?  *He finishes wiping
        the blood off of Soul Crusher and sheathes it.*
Piccolo: (disgustedly) Pixy Misa.  Small-timer from the Useless
         Dimension.  (to himself) And a royal pain in the ass.
Ashram: (smiling) Ah, that dimension.  I remember visiting once there
        myself.  That Yosho is quite a swordsman.  Now what can I do
        for you, little girl?
Pixy Misa: (speechless)  A-a-a-a...  *She holds out the pad and pen.*
Ashram: (chuckling) Oh, an autograph.  *He takes both from her, and
        signs his name is flowing, practiced cursive.*  There you go.
Pixy Misa: (blushing heavily)  T-t-thanks.
Ashram: Well, now that that's over, I need to get back to work.  The
        Lodoss Academy of Acting is waiting for my speech.  (to Piccolo)
        See you at the next union meeting.  (to all of them)  And
        remember, vote for Ashram in 2000!
Fujisawa: But... wait!  Can't you tell us... *Ashram fades out of 
          existence.* ...how to get out of here...
Piccolo: (grinning) Haven't seem him in a while.  *He returns to sitting
         on the couch.*
Pixy Misa: (awed) I can't believe I got to meet Ashram in person!  *She
           returns to the couch as well, and sits there hugging the pad
           of paper.*
Misato: What's so special about this guy anyway?  Just looked like
        another yahoo with a sword to me.
Piccolo: Ashram's the Chairman of the Anti-Heroes Union.  Him and
         Kagato as VP are running for US President in 2000.
Misato: (shrugs) Good luck to them, I guess.
Fujisawa: So, umm... what do you want to do with the body?

[Scene: The Projection Booth that looks like a Projecton Booth.  Don
Euclid is standing in the center of a totally clean room.  The projector 
is fixed and ready to roll once again.]

Don Euclid: Wow, good thing I remembered this summoning device.  Those
            little buggers are great for fixing and cleaning stuff.  *He
            turns to the projector.*  I guess it's time to start the
            film back up.  Now that Washu is gone, anyway.

{Scene: The Theatre's Interior.  The characters are gathered around the 
dead body and severed head of Tatewaki Kuno.]

Misato: So what ARE we going to do with this?  There are no wastebaskets
        in here, and I'm sure not going to chuck him in a corner to rot!
Piccolo: I could cremate him.  *Just as his hands begin to flash with
         ki, the projector starts up and Don Euclid appears on screen
         again.*
DE's Voice: Don't bother with that.  Just watch.  *A few seconds later,
            a ton of little furry things that look like tribbles sweep
            through the room.*
Pixy Misa: What are these things?
DE's Voice: Oh, they're pocket monsters.
Misato: (angrily) Pocket monsters?!  Is this some kind of a joke?
DE's Voice: (smugly) It's a pocket dimension, isn't it?
Piccolo: (grinding his teeth) Little...furry...things...I..Hate...
         Little...Furry...THINGS!
Fujisawa: What I wouldn't give for Urra to be here right about now.
DE's Voice: Don't worry, they're harmless.  Sorta.  *As quickly as
            the tide appeared, it disappears, leaving a freshly 
            cleaned carpet and no body.*  Now, if you wouldn't mind
            sitting down, we have a MSTing to finish.  *The characters,
            grumbling, oblige.*

[Scene: The Theatre's Interior.  The fanfic is resuming.]

>a while not being able to look away, she knew what she was doing 
>because she had seen her sister do it before, in fact Ayeka was quite 
>commonly caught by Sasami playing with herself. But Ayeka always denied 
>everything as usual. Watching now with a very clear view but still 

Pixy Misa: I've always admired Ayeka.  She's almost as good as I am
           at playing the "sweet and innocent" act.  *She lets out a
           female version of the classic Jinnai laugh.*
Others: (sweatdrop) ...

>unnoticed by Washu who was preoccupied at the moment, Sasami got this 
>strange feeling, a warm tingling sensation Between her legs. Not quite 

Piccolo: Yep, I was right.  Here it comes.
Pixy Misa: Just get it all in the cup again and everything's cool, ok?
Misato: (swatting Pixy Misa) Old joke.  Not funny any more.
Pixy Misa: (rubbing her head) Ow!  Okay, okay...

>knowing how to react she put her hand down towards her moistening 
>mound. Just barley touching the outer rim of her sex with her middle 
>finger while letting out small almost unheard gasps. Still watching

Fujisawa: Barley?  You can make beer with that...
Pixy Misa: Moistening Mound?  Isn't that the name of a rock band?
Misato: Nah, I think it's a kind of candy bar.

>Washu work magic on herself, she saw that Washu stopped for a moment 
>and a small black portal opened above her left shoulder and out of the 
>portal came a long sturdy piece of plastic. Washu wasting no time 

Misato: (Washu impression) I may have invented better things, but
sometimes nothing beats an old fashioned hunk o' plastic.

>shoved it up into her swollen mound instantly letting out a cry of joy. 

Pixy Misa: Viva la Dildo!

>Slowly she thrust her new toy in and out of her luscious mound, crying 
>out as she picked up the pace. Letting her sweet juices run all into 

Misato: Couldn't Washu just clone herself a toy boy?  And I think she'd
        rather do that in private, in her adult form.
Fujisawa: Like you said, smile and nod.

>the water, she took the vibrator out her cunt and put it up to her 
>eager lips, she just couldn't wait any longer she crammed the vibrator 
>all the way into her through nearly choking herself. As she took it out 
>of her mouth she relished in the taste of her honey.

Piccolo: (Sargeant from Full Metal Jacket) Do you suck dicks?!
Others: Sir, no, sir!
Piccolo: Are you a peter puffer?!
Others: Sir, no, sir!
Piccolo: Bullshit, boy!  You look like you could suck a golf ball out
         of a garden hose!  I'll be watching you!

>        Sasami still watching diligently she decided to get a little 
>more risky, she starts to spread the lips of her pussy and nervously 

Pixy Misa: Watching diligently... and taking notes.  Now that's the
           Sasami I know.
Fujisawa: (shocked) What?!
Pixy Misa: (innocently) But she does it in class all the time!

>stick in her middle finger deep inside herself, letting out a loud moan 
>of pleasure. Feeling how wet she was and watching Washu with her new 
>"toy" started to turn her on, she wasn't sure what to think all these 

Misato: Since when do you have to think while you're doing THAT?

>new emotions and sensations, at that moment she started to wonder if 
>she was normal for liking this. Even though she had watched her sister 

Fujisawa: Hey, you're as normal as anybody.  What's abnormal is somebody
          else writing about it...

>before it never made her feelings go wild like this. Not being able to 
>contain her self any longer, she stuck two fingers in and thrusting 
>them at a vigorous pace, her muscles starting to tense around her 
>fingers as a gush of liquid flowed from between her legs.

Misato: Everybody come down to Sasami's Soda Fountain!  Today and today
        only, free refills on Cherry Coke!
Piccolo: (shuddering) Ugh.

>        "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH" she cried out as she fell out from 
>behind the bolder. Washu quickly turns her attention from her self to 
>the young girl who was lying there in the water.

Fujisawa: (Sasami impression) Hey, do you think I can win some cash
          by submitting this to the "World's Funniest" as hidden
          camera footage?

>        "Sasami!?" Washu screamed in astonishment. Sasami looking up, 
>eyes half closed noticed Washu looking at her, with what strength she 
>could gather she tried to stand up. Quickly her knees went out and she 
>fell back into the water. Washu smiling softly as she helped the young 

Misato: (Sasami impression) Now how am I going to make it on the
        Jurian All-Star Track Team?!  Waaaaah!

>girl to her feet. Nervously Washu asked "H-H-How long have you been 
>watching?" Sasami not knowing what to say looks away blushing for a few 

Piccolo: (Nabiki impression) Long enough, girlfriend.  Now hand over
         some cash and this stays between you and me.

>seconds than speaking in a shy and nervous tone "I-I...I didn't mean 
>to, honest. I'm sorry!" Sasami almost crying, not knowing how to handle 
>all that she was feeling right now.

Fujisawa: You know, I've always wondered what "Handling" meant in the
          phrase "Shipping and Handling".
Misato: In a world of self-sticking stamps and special sauce, I doubt
        that we'll ever know.

>	Washu noticed that Sasami still had her hand laying firmly between
>her legs. Washu now with an almost evil smile on her face said "Did you 
>like what you saw? Did it excite you?" Washu already knowing the 

Pixy Misa: (triumphantly) I was right!  A lesbian scene!
Misato: (revolted) Disgusting!  I can't believe that the author wrote
        in a lesbian scene between two girls who are physically twelve
        years old!
Fujisawa: I thought you said that after "End of Evangelion"...
Misato: Dying brutally is easier than reading this shit!
Piccolo: Amen, sister!

>answer. Sasami didn't say a anything, she couldn't say anything, what 
>would she say? She didn't expect a question like that, especially from 

Pixy Misa: (Sasami impression) You're the greatest scientist in the
           universe, why don't you tell me?

>Washu! Before Sasami could say anything Washu walked towards her. "you 
>don't have to be ashamed." She said as she put hand on Sasami's cheek 
>and pulled her head closer to hers, embracing her in a passionate kiss. 

Fujisawa: You know, I never thought I'd see something that would
          make me rather prefer a John Waters film, but...

>Sasami, seeing as this was her first real kiss, was very  nervous 
>especially with the fact that it was with another woman. Sasami 

Misato: (livid) Another WOMAN?!  They're TWELVE YEAR OLDS!
Piccolo: (impressed) Whoa.  I think I'm going to have to let you
         kill the author of this one.
Misato: Damn straight!

>was very tense at first but quickly started to relax. Washu slowly 
>pressed a passionate tongue into her little partners inexperienced 
>mouth. Shocked at first she than let go of her worries and followed 

Piccolo: The first person to even THINK of saying "Hakuna Matata" is
         going to be sent to an alternate dimension.
Pixy Misa: (giggling) Piccolo got censored again!
Piccolo: (angrily) Damnit!

>suite and inserted her own tongue into the mouth of the beautiful red 
>head.
>	After a minute Washu broke there kiss and put her hands on her 
>young companions shoulders. She stood there admiring Sasami's pert 
>breasts which were large for her age, but this was no surprise from a 

Pixy Misa: Breasts?  Yeah, right.  Sasami's a carpenter's dream: Flat
           as a board and...
Others: (threateningly) Gag time again?
Pixy Misa: (shuts up real quick) ...

>princess of Jurai. She quickly got down on here knees and looked up at 
>Sasami with a smile. Her sights than went south past her firm mounds 
>down towards her beautiful blue pubic hair. Washu quickly placed her 

Misato: The author really doesn't know much about human physiology, does
        he?  A twelve year old with large breasts and a muff?
Fujisawa: Maybe he's been reading the American "Tenchi Muyo" comic
          book.  That artist draws EVERYTHING with cleavage.

>tongue against the outer regions of Sasami's sensitive cunt. The young 
>girl twitching at the feeling of someone else touching her body 
>and giving it such pleasure. Her thoughts went to images of Tenchi as 

Pixy Misa: (opens her mouth to say something, then shuts it abruptly)
Piccolo: (grinning) Wise decision.

>Washu had her way with the young princess.  Washu touching her body and 
>giving it such pleasure. Washu stopped for a second and  Sasami looked 
>down with a yearnful look in her eyes. " I can stop" Washu said softly 
>and sincerely  " If you want me to." 	

Piccolo: (Washu impression) PLEASE tell me to stop!  This is really
         disgusting and I'm not getting paid nearly enough!

>	Sasami just nodded, she didn't want this to stop. she had never 
>experienced anything like this before. Washu gently spread the lips of 
>Sasami's moist pussy just a little and drove her tongue as deep as she 

Piccolo: (looking green again) Urk.
Misato: Uh oh.  *She pulls an umbrella out of nowhere and begins to
        open it.*
Fujisawa: Ditto on that.  *He does the same.*
Pixy Misa: (looking greener than Piccolo) Ulp.

>could into Sasami's very tight opening. She felt her muscles tense up a 
>bit as she was already starting to reach her climax. Sasami started cum 
>as Washu inserted a finger into her swollen blue mound. Washu sucking 

Pixy Misa: (weakly) Since when d-did Smurfette get into the story?
Misato: Are you alright?
Pixy Misa: I donno.  I think I've just been ecchi'd out.
Piccolo: (groaning) Join the club.

>up what she could of the young girls juices. Sasami screaming at the 
>top her lungs at the mixture of pain and pleasure that swept over her 
>body, than silence.
>	Washu took her fingers up so Sasami's panting mouth. She 
>instinctively started to suck on the sticky liquid that was being 
>introduced to her.

Piccolo & Pixy Misa: (averting their eyes) Ack!
DE's Voice: (over the theatre speakers)  Even I'm getting grossed
            out here.  What was this guy thinking?!

>	"Mmmmmmmmmm......" she said softly with a smile on her face.
>	" I agree totally." Washu said with delight as she licked her 
>lips, cum splashed over her face. Sasami catching here breath and 
>feeling much more at ease, she grabbed a handful of red pubic hair. 

Misato: Gee.  Red, white, and blue.
Fujisawa: I don't think there's an amendment covering permission to
          write really horrible Sasami lemons.
Misato: Freedom of speech, remember?
Pixy Misa: But the author's impinging on my "Pursuit of Happiness"!

>Washu, shocked at how bold she had become in such a short time, let out 
>a small yelp at the contact of her small hand. Her love box was soaking 
>wet with her juices as Sasami started to 

All: (Singing) Love Shack! Baby, Love Shack!

>explore Washu's glistening folds of womanhood. Washu deciding to lend a 
>guiding hand, held the back of Sasami's head and puled it towards her 
>thrusting pelvic region. Making sure that the young girl hit all of the 
>right spots. Sasami moving her tongue around trying to imitate what she 
>had felt Washu doing to her earlier, and being very successful at it. 
>Violently attacking her sex with speratic left and right movements. She 
>stopped occasionally to catch her breath of air. Washu enjoying every 
>minute of it, longing for the time of  her own 
>orgasm. She assisted the princess by adding her own fingers to the mix. 

Piccolo & Pixy Misa: (heads still averted) Is it over yet?
Fujisawa: Unfortunately, no.  The author's decided to go into even
          more detail.

>Sasami felt Washu start to spasm and despite her inexperience she knew 
>what she was going to happen and prepared herself, trying to catch all 
>of her juices in her mouth. She relished in the taste of her partners 
>cum. It was sweeter than when Washu let her taste herself, but it was 
>just as good.
>	They both lay against a bolder and rested, when they both decided 
>to leave they stopped right before the doorway that lead back into the 
>house. They looked at each other and shared one more passionate kiss 
>together " Thank you .... Sasami" is all that Washu could say as she 
>smiled wit a peaceful look on her face. As she waked off Sasami, 
>speaking in a soft voice " Thank you Washu.... I will always remember 
>this day.......forever!"

Fujisawa: NOW it's over!
Pixy Misa: (shakily) Okay... *She looks cautiously at the screen.* Oh,
           it really IS over!
Piccolo: (relieved) Good.  Now where is that JARR guy?

>***********************************************************************

Misato: I don't think Siskel and Ebert would give this even half a star,
        let alone that many.
Pixy Misa: They gave the dub of "Tokyo Decadence" two thumbs up, though.
Others: (fall over) ...

>the end ..... for now.

DE's Voice: Oh, yeah.  I forgot to tell you, this one has a second part
            to it!
Pixy Misa: (freaking out) NOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo!
Piccolo: (growling) Killkillkillkillkill...
Misato & Fujisawa: Oh, terrific.

>*** well I hoped you liked it ..... if you did their will be plenty 
>more Tenchi Muyo  lemons ***

Piccolo: (still growling) ...killkillkillkillkillkill...

>*** on the way... until then .. seeya  "meow"                                                               
>***  
>*** sorry this one was so short.... its my first attempt to write a 
>fan-fic..                         

Misato: Oh, don't apologize.  In fact, make it shorter next time!
Fujisawa: Not bad for a first attempt.  It usually takes practice to
          write a fanfic this disgusting.

Piccolo: (still growling) ...killkill... THERE HE IS!  Lemme at
         him!  I'm gonna kill `im!
Pixy Misa: But you can't get to him.
Piccolo: (sheepishly) Oh, yeah.
