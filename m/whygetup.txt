	WHY DID I GET UP THIS MORNING?


Why the hell did I get up this morning?
Why did I go to bed at night?
Everyday is a struggle of wills-
All those two girls do is fight!

But I guess it could be much much worse
And I get up to make breakfast for myself
When I realise a princess is doing it for me-
So I got power and I got wealth-
But if you had to make a choice like me
Would you bother at all?
Or sit around waiting for a beautiful
Blonde police woman to fall?

Why the hell did I get up this morning?
Why did I go to bed at night?
Everyday is a struggle of wills-
All those two girls do is fight!

On no Ryoko's come down staires
I want to give her a kiss
But I can't cos if I did I'd be killing
A girl who is still on my list
I have to duck and crawl under the table
Hopin' dad will save me 
Or just sit around until some 
spirit godess is old enough to claim me

Oh, why the hell did I get up this morning?
Why did I go to bed at night?
Everyday is a struggle of wills-
All those two girls do is fight!

Damn now Kiyone and Mihoshi are fighting
And I have to sword train again
Washu wants to collect my sample
With that sexy nurse outfit: size 10
So what else should I do in my spare time?
Go away to Tokyo
Meet some pale skinned dark haired
girl who'll love me...wait a minute...hell no!

Oh, now I know why I got up this morning-
Why I sleep so deeply at night 
Everyday is a banquet of thrills-
It's such a beautiful sight!

Ryoko is a diva with the spiky hair
Ayeka my queen of the Earth
Sesami my sister, Washu my mentor
Mihoshi and Kiyone a pair of such mirth
My family is great, I gotta say
I really love my life-
But wait a minute
was that my mum's kimono my
dad's camera my grandad's 
shrine a lunatic with tiny
specs come to kill me a 
psycopathic godess a
frog who used to be one of my
mates and a huge explosion destroying my house?
Get me some sake!
I need a wife!

Ryoko! Ayeka! What the hell happened to my room....?!

That was one of the fastest things I ever
wrote- a little under 10 minutes I think that
took. I'd love to know if you liked it
and what you liked about it, so get in touch-
Yrs.
