Sakuya  Gotta Die by Cool Max 0


Cool Max walks in to a room filled with little kids 
 
  "Hello kiddies. I'm here to tell you about a girl you must kill" said 
Max 
"Killing is bad," said a little boy
"Oh, its okay to kill this girl" said Cool Max as he began to sing
This girl is evil, this girl is bad, and this girl must die!!

All the kids were looking at Max like he was a psycho-path. (I would 
to).
"Why do we have to kill her?" ask a little girl
"If you didn't get it the first time, you don't get it" said Max
Then a tall man came in to the room and pull out Max, when the man came 
back in to the room he said "Sorry, but when the crazy Tenchi fans get 
out of jail they always go to the pre-school first, some thing about a 
army of minion six-year olds.

(WOW, that was creepy. But I DON'T LIKE SAKUYA and I just cant found 
a"Sakuya must die" page, so I write this, Oh yeah if you're a Sakuya 
fan (yeah right) DON'T READ THIS or is it too late now, 
BAWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA E-mail me at coolmax_zero@hotmail.com.  Oh, I don't 
own that little bitch Sakuya. )
