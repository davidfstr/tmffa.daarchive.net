Discalimer: Tenchi is not my property,
as I have said millions of times, because
AIC and Pioneer got their firsy with their
corporate deal crap and I was left on a side
street with nothing but my saxophone... LEFT!!!
With a saxophone I tell you!!!

Notes:
This is very silly, so don't expect things like

a) Sense
b) Sensibility
c) Jane Austin

or

d) Plot. Of any kind. Meh.

Anyways, stand by for:
       
 ****** WATCH OUT- THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN! ******
			

(Tenchi wakes up and sees the sunlight come through
the windows. It is a truly gorgoeus summer day)

Tenchi: Hmm...it's a lovely day. Just the kind of day
I need, after all these long months, to declare my
eternal love for Ryoko!

(Tenchi goes off to find Ryoko, who is in the garden)

Ryoko: Hi Tenchi hon!

(Ryoko glomps Tenchi and kisses him passionately, then
stops)

Ryoko: Hey! You're not forcing me off!
Tenchi: No, Ryoko- it's time to tell you the truth.
Ryoko: What is it?
Tenchi: Ryoko- I LOVE YOU!

(Ryoko blushes and buries her face in her hands)

Ryoko: Oh Tenchi! I thought you'd never love me...I'm
so sorry...
Tenchi: About what?
Ryoko: Well...you see I...(she blushes)...well, when
I thought you'd never be intrested in me, I started to
become attracted to...Ayeka...
Tenchi: WHAT?! Oh, god damn it.
Ryoko: I'm really sorry. I guess we'd better tell her.
Tenchi: I suppose you're right.

(They go to find Ayeka, who is reading a trashy romance
on the sofa)

Ryoko: Ayeka?
Ayeka: Ryoko? Is there something you want to say?
Ryoko: Well...I know we've never been close before
this but, I guess you always hurt the one...you love.
Ayeka: What?
Ryoko: Ayeka- I love you.
Ayeka: Oh Ryoko! Why didn't you tell me before! I loved
you, just after I found out Tenchi loved you...but then
you were so tied up with him I thought I'd never have
a chance. Then I started pining over someone else...
because you and her were so different.
Ryoko: Who? Tell me please, Ayeka-chan!
Tenchi: Yeah Ayeka- who do you love more than Ryoko?
Ayeka: I love...DON'T laugh! I love...Miho-chan.
Tenchi: But your always so mean to her!
Ayeka: Ryoko was right- you always hurt the one you love.
But she's so KAWAII! I can't resist.
Ryoko: (puts her head in her hands and sobs)
Ayeka: I'm so sorry Ryoko...if only you'd said.
Tenchi: Well, I guess you'd better tell Mihoshi now
you've told us.
Ayeka: I suppose your right. 

(They wander off to find Mihoshi swimming in the 
hot springs. All three promptly get nosebleeds and 
run off to find tissues before returning)

Ayeka (slightly muffled by tissue): Mihoshi, 
I must tell you something.

Mihoshi: What? I haven't missed the cartoons again
have I?
Ayeka: No it's not that.
Mihoshi: I...I'm sorry I let Ryo-Ohki wet the bed.
I didn't know she wasn't house trained.
Ayeka: It's not that, either Miho-chan.
Mihoshi: Er...Sesami didn't tell you we ate the last
of the lollipops did she?
Ayeka: YOU ATE THE LAST OF THE...!!! Er...ahem...
no, no, no. It's not those things Mihoshi.
Mihoshi: What is it then?
Ayeka: I...I love you, Mihoshi.  

(Mihoshi bursts into tears)

Mihoshi: Ayeka! You CAN'T love me...how can anyone 
love me when even someone whose been with me for 
years still ignores me, who has seen me at my best 
and worst, who've I've stood by at every turn still 
thinks I'm nothing!
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

(Everyone Sweatdrops)

Tenchi: I think she loves Kiyone.

Diabolo: Well duh...like we didn't see that one coming
fifty million miles off without binoculars.
Tenchi: No author insertion please.
Ayeka: Who says I don't want an authour's insertion? 

(Ayeka drapes herself over Diabolo)

Diabolo: I'll see you later...much later.
Ayeka: (purrs)
Tenchi: AYEKA! You love Mihoshi in this fic, and your
heart has just been broken. Di, clear off, Ayeka
get back into character!
Ayeka: Oh...okay. Waaaa! No! That teal-haired 
bitch stole my love! Wa wa wa yadeyadeyadeya....

(Later, in the yagami, Kiyone is in her underwear
getting ready for a Lemon fic)

Kiyone: (whispers) Took you guys long enough! I have
to do 'The Erotic Adeventures of Kiyone' next...
Tenchi: (quiet) Sorry (louder again) Ahem...er...
Kiyone! Mihoshi loves you!

Kiyone: Oh dear.
Mihoshi: (sad) Oh no! SHE loves someone else too!

(suddenly the voice of Diabolo-the-t.v.-presenter
comes on)

Diabolo: (on voiceover) Tell the Audience who it is, Kiyone!
Is he behind DOOR number one...

(door Noumber one opens to reveal the Onsen lady with
a placard saying 'No')

Diabolo: Or DOOR number two...

(Number Two swings open to reveal Amagasaki with a 
similar sign)

Diabolo: Or DOOR number three...

(Yosho stands with a triumphant 'Yes' placard)

Audience: HA HA! Kiyone loves the old guy!

(Kiyones blushes)

Mihoshi: BAH! I lost Kiyone to some senile old jerk.
Kiyone: You're obviosuly immune to the charms of an
older man.
Ayeka: I'm not. *I* like Yosho.
Tenchi: (sternly) Ayeka- WHO do you love in this fic?
Ayeka: (sulky) Mihoshi.
Mihoshi: Yay!
Tenchi: MIHOSHI!!
Mihoshi: Sorry Tenchi...
Kiyone: Anyway- I guess we'd better find Yosho...

(And so, after the confessions...)

Yosho: Er...well...er...I'm sorry Kiyone. Even though
you are immesnly touchable...
Audience: Perv!
Yosho: My true love after Ayeka was always...WASHU!!!

(And so it carrys on....here are the summaries of 
the next interactions so you don't get bored!)

SPECIAL tastes? Y'know? Wink wink? Nudge nudge? I mean,

Reaction from lovee: "Oh this is just great...we're back 
to the beginning again..."

			THE BAD ENDING
Unable to confront these terribles losses, all the Tenchi household
split up and went their sepearate ways. Some commited ritual Juian
sucide and sought solance in death, some lived long and empty lives
and some just became country rock stars and wrote songs about the 
terrible end all loves have. The universe ended miserably and God
turned out to be just an illusion of the self.

		       THE HAPPY ENDING
When everyone realised just how much they loved each other, 
the need for conventional relationships disappeared and the 
gang all lived full happy lives in the knowledge that they 
were a family, if a rather strange family with unnatural 
feelings for each other. 
When they died all on the same day 1000s of Millenia into the 
future they were buried together in the most beautiful plot of 
Jurai. The universe did not end but simply returned to the 
beginning and was lived all for the better again and again until 
a perfect vision of reality was honed. God turned out to be a 
happy chap like Father Christmas, Santa Claus or St. Nick but 
with sandals like Jesus (da man) and a hawiian shirt like
some party d00d.

		     THE PLEASURABLE ENDING
Everyone decided to have a party to celebrate and ended up having 
an unnaturally frenzied and well-planned orgy. This carried on 
for several months, whereupon they all needed a couple of seasons 
in rehab. However, afterward the need for conventional 
relationships disappeared and they carried on their antics 
for 1000s of millenia until they died of exhaustion. 
God turned out to be bisexual
(R00000000000000000000000lllllllllllllllllzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)
and the universe ended in a huge planetary orgasm incorporating 
all living creatures. Wohoo. Oh, except Leeches and Lampreys 
who went to hell with Kagato and the KKK.

	       Oh, and Ayeka slept with Diabolo! Wohoo!
         
       *******************JUST THE END*******************

Well, I know it was CALLED 'This Could Actually Happen'...but
as you may have realised by now, it is impossible. I would 
never sleep with Ayeka on the first date.
Anyways, I hope it brought some sunshine into your lives unlike
my constant saxophone blowing at King's Cross Station.
Well, it's goodbye from me for now!
Bye!

Yrs.
