Guardian Stranger
By Karmin StJean
(dedicated to John DeMita)

 A comet and a shooting star
 Traversed the nighttime sky
 The comet said, unto itself,
 "The world beneath must die,
 There is no room in my domain
 for thee, or thou, or thy."

 The bell rang shortly after dawn
 They gathered at its cry,
 To hear the plans made for their days
 And listen by and by,
 To speeches about what and when,
 And who, and where and why?
 And in their midst the stranger stood,
 With starlight in his eyes.

 'Neath chestnut locks, a face as white
 As snow fresh from the skies,
 Holds sorrow deep for his companions'
 untimely demise.
 But grief this great cannot be borne
 And so it must give rise,
 To anger toward the murd'ring thing
 The stranger did despise.

 With foe not far yet not quite near,
 The stranger then surmised,
 That for his fate, he'd have to wait
 And see what leads arised
 And in the crowd, he spotted her,
 With sweet and sparkling eye,
 descendant of his foe's own foe
 And Princess of Jurai

 Because these things, this girl knew not
 The stranger knew she'd die,
 If he kept not a watchful gaze
 Upon the winter sky.
 And if he did not guard her well,
 And always stay nearby.

 Behind a desk in hallowed halls
 The stranger showed no vice,
 But stare as hard as tempered steel
 And heart as cold as ice
 Not daring to form lasting bonds,
 Ere one he loved might die
 Refusing to shed any tear
 Was much too proud to cry.

 Then in they walked, two students new,
 From under foreign sky,
 One regal-proud, one blue of hair
 Who caught the stranger's eye.
 And blue-hair eyed the stranger with
 Suspicion in her eyes.

 Beside the window, nonchalant,
 Backdrop of azure sky
 He kept his gaze upon the girl
 As blue-hair keep her eyes
 Upon him, though her purpose there,
 He just could not surmise.

 He took his meal in solitude,
 Although his starlight eyes,
 Burned fiercely with annoyance as
 Blue-hair turned her own eyes
 Of gold to gaze upon him,
 He departed by the by...

 The girl he swore he would protect,
 Stood 'neath the winter skies,
 Gazing upon an unbuilt house
 With new love in her eyes,
 Beside her stood the architect,
 With tender, loving eyes.

 The stranger watched from 'hind a tree
 Keeping a watchful eye
 On two who chatted, happily
 He heard the young girl sigh
 He drew away, quite suddenly,
 When blue-hair wandered nigh

 In Tokyo, the stranger sat
 Apart from other guys,
 While keeping watch upon the one
 Who's shining eyes belied
 A love for her dear architect
 Which she'd yet to decry.

 Then blue-hair turned her eyes toward him
 And gave to tongue a cry
 And o'er bench, and thickest shrub
 The stranger passed them by
 As fleeing blue-hair as she moved
 As fast as she could fly

 The streets, still crowded after dark,
 The stranger drew he nigh
 To the young girl and architect,
 Not seeing blue-hair nigh
 He heard her gasp, then moved along
 They must have thought him shy

 Through crowded streets unto the beach
 To where a temple lie
 Upon the steps as blue-hair stood
 Not seeing him draw nigh
 Until he stood behind blue-hair,
 And whispered to her "I

 Know who you are, and what you are
 But why you've come here I,
 Am not aware and I don't care,
 Just listen, now, as I
 Confide in you the reason
 That our common foe draws nigh;
 To destroy she who unknowing holds
 The Power of Jurai.

 But he shall not destroy the girl,
 I swear to you for I,
 Shall soon defeat the vile shadow
 Who has drawn me nigh
 For what he did, I seek revenge!"
 Then he shed his disguise.

 The face beneath, which he revealed
 caught blue-hair by surprise
 As leapt he to the temple roof
 She could not turn her eyes,
 And vanished he, then before she
 Could make them both allies.

 The morning sunlight sparkled
 But never shone into the eyes
 Of he who now stood vigilant,
 Now void of all disguise
 With weapon drawn, as through dark cloth
 He scanned the morning skies

 All energy fell silent then,
 The lift it ceased to rise,
 The comet circled round them
 Then it crashed in from the sky
 And said "Where is it, that I seek?
 The Power of Jurai!"

 "I know that it is very close,
 Its very scent is nigh
 It fuels my anger and my rage
 And suffer for it I,
 have done for much too long now,
 And revenge shall soon be mine!

 Whoever wields that power here,
 I shall cause your demise"
 He started to move closer,
 But then something from the skies
 Perhaps akin to thunderbolts
 Had caught him by surprise!

 The comet sped up and away
 He'd later kill Jurai,
 Right now he had another task
 And other fish to fry
 Someone'd had the nerve to shoot him,
 Who'd dare to even try?

 Not comet now, but shadow dark
 Cold malice in three eyes,
 A patch of night which blocked the light
 Eclipsing sunlit skies
 And those three most vile orbs
 Perhaps there was surprise

 "Survivor, brave and spirited,
 too well worked your disguise
 I greatly fear, none know you're here
 It shall be your demise!"
 The stranger said, "I'll do my best
 No matter if I die,

 I'll see you fall, oh foul foe,
 Before the end is nigh.
 Though wounded grim, with hope now dim,
 The stranger had to try,
 Entangled then, in shadow cold...
 A last, defiant, cry.
