Tenchi: (Sits in the living room of his house, looking at an infant with
very short blue hair sleeping in a crib.)

Tenchi's Grandfather: (Enters the room and smiles at the infant before
sitting down next to Tenchi.)  "What's the matter boy?"

Tenchi: "I'm worried grandfather."

Grandfather: "Has Mayuka had any problems?"

Tenchi: "No, she's great and with all the girls around here I hardly have
to do anything.  That's what I'm worried about really."

Grandfather: "How so?"

Tenchi: "Well, first you had Ryoko locked up here and you never told me
about her."

Grandfather: "Tenchi, I warned you not to enter that cave."

Tenchi: "Yeah, but you kept dangling the keys in front of me, like you
were daring me to try it.  And then Ayeka and Sasami came here because you
never called them."

Grandfather: "My communicator was ruined in the crash."

Tenchi: "But, it didn't take E.T. 700 years to build a phone.  And then
Washu came to stay with her daughter and now I've got a daughter because
you had a fling with that demon all those years ago."

Grandfather: "Tenchi, you love all these girls don't you?"

Tenchi: "Yeah, I guess so."

Grandfather: "Then what is there to be worried about, boy?"

Tenchi: "I'm just worried that there might be other parts of your karma
that I'll need to work off."

Grandfather: "Hmmmm....  I recall once asking a goddess if she'd stay with
me forever."

Peorth: (Drops into Tenchi's lap and throws her arms around him.)  "Fuu
Fuu!"

Tenchi: "No, you've got the wrong guy!  I didn't do it!"
