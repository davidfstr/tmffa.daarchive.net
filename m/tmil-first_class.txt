Tenchi Muyo! In Love
"First Class"
---------------------

Achika looked up at the new student as he walked into the
classroom.

"Class," the teacher told everyone, "This is Naoki Takahashi.
He's just moved to Japan recently so lets all help him out,
okay."

Achika nodded and smiled, softly.

The boy couldn't help smile back. As he passed Nobuyuki's desk
on the way to his seat, he leaned over and whispered to him:
"You and Achika are certainly a cute couple."

Nobuyuki blushed, furiously and the boy smiled in satisfaction
to see it. Nobuyuki looked up, intending to make some kind of
embarrassed denial, and saw the slitted pupils looking back at
him. He fell silent. One couldn't hide the truth from demons and
if the eyes were any indication, this boy was at least half
demon.
