Top Ten Things You Don't to Hear From Washu...


10. You promised you'd be my guinea pig!
09. I just want to examine you a *little* bit.
08. Let's shake the dew off this lily, shall we?
07. Your breasts are sagging
06. We'll check <your> memory with this device.
05. Why would I be interested in something I can't tell the front from the back... (oops! 
that should be Top Ten Things You Don't Want to *SAY* to Washu)
04. You'll be a watersprite so you can reflect on your behavior.
03. Time to accelerate!
02. You want to be a guinea pig for my experiments?

And the number one thing you don't want to hear from Washu...
