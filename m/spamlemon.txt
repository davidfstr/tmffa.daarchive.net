Speaking of TM! lemons, I was discussing the subject on the Tenchi ML a 
while back and suggested a list of lemons that don't involve Sasami-chan 
(underage Sasami lemons being one of my pet peeves) and furthermore, 
don't involve Tenchi. Anyway, two of seem to have promise, but I just 
don't have the time to do them, so I'll throw them out here...

1. Mihoshi and Yukinojo. I do have an suggestion for how this story could 
end...

[Open with Mihoshi aboard her patrol ship]

Mihoshi fiddled with her control cube. A dozen or so bizarre "marital 
aids" appeared in the air and crashed onto the deck. She picked one up and 
eyed it forlornly.

"It's not *powerful* enough!" She frantically twisted the cube some 
more. "I should have paid more attention when they explained how to use 
this thing!" More devices appeared and likewise dropped onto the floor of 
the ship. None of them were what Mihoshi was looking for. "AGHH!! Why 
can't this thing materialize me a decent vibrator?!?!"

Mihoshi gave up and pouted as she put the cube down. Then her eyes 
brightened with an idea. She smiled. "Oh, Yu-ki-noo-joooo..."

Yukinojo extended down from the ceiling. "Yes, Mihoshi?"

Much later...

[Cut to Galaxy Police Headquarters]

"A worker's compensation claim?!"

"That's right, sir."

"FROM A ROBOT?!?!"

"Well, yes, sir. It seems Detective Mihoshi managed to snap several of
Yukinojo's neck joints and crush his cranial dome."

"But he's built to survive a crash that would destroy the entire rest of
the patrol ship! How'd even Mihoshi manage to do all that damage to him?!"

"Uh, I don't think you want to know, sir..."


2. The *real* reason Tokimi is so anxiously searching for Tsunami and 
Washuu. ^_^


Hassheen!
