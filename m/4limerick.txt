Limericks from Ryoko, Washu, Ayeka, and Tenchi

A Princess from planet Jurai
Wanted to get her hands on my guy
What the hell is she thinking
With all of that winking
And flirting as she passes by?
                                -Ryoko

My guinea pig's looking so fine
Someday, heart and soul he'll be mine
The others they shout
And make noise all about
But as long as I get him, that's fine.
                                -Washu

That monster won't take him away.
Not ever if I have my say.
I shall be Tenchi's bride
I can say that with pride
I can't wait until our wedding day.
                                -Ayeka

Ayeka thinks she is quite chic
And Ryoko is often quited piqued
But I fear that I may
Soon join Operative A
(see, I married Mihoshi last week!)
                                -Tenchi
