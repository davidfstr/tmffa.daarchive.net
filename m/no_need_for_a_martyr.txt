I warn you, this is sad.

No Need for a Martyr
--------------------

Washuu sat in her lab, staring at the small rack of samples in front of her.
Tissue and semen. He'd known that the worst could happen, and he'd had her
extract one and ... well, he'd provided the other.

But should she do as he asked? She had a subatomic map of his brain, but it
might be corrupted. But maybe it was the only thing to do.

Achika and Nobuyuki looked out over the grounds, where the Juraians were
finally leaving- there was no reason to stay, now. Not since Tenchi's death.
It had seemed to be the only way, really. A life for a life.

But they had had since 1970 to get used to the fact that their only child
would die saving their lives.

In her room, Ryoko sat,curled up. Due to the strange system Washuu had used
to transfer the images Tenchi had seen, she'd had a limited telepathy with
him. And his last thoughts stayed with her...

"Get them OUT of here! Now!"

Tenchi was seriously wounded- all could see that. In subspace, Kain was
looming over him, and then he did something strange.

He sat down, cross-legged, and extinguised Tenchi-ken, raising the sword in
front of him.

-I'mdyingnowgottaendthis-

He started to float, and tendrils of energy crackled around him.

Kain had looked terrified, and tried to get away.

-goodbye-

Washuu had seen a tremendous power surge building within the portal, and had
thrown the switch closing it.

For Tenchi Masaki's last act was to detonate the Jurai energy inherent in
him and the sword, eliminating Kain, himself and the planet in subspace.

Warned you, didn't I?
