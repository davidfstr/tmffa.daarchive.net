Out of consideration for the prolific, but overworked, Paul (have you
ever considered a career in commercial writing?), here's one that should
*not* give him a new idea.

[Opening shot: Early morning.  Tenchi has fallen asleep in his clothes
on a wheeled chair.  Ryo-ohki has curled up on his lap.]

[Switch shots to behind Ryo-ohki's point of view.  The door to Washu's
lab opens by itself.  We see Ryo-ohki sniff something.]

Ryo-ohki: Miya!

[Cue "Linus & Lucy" background music.]

[Ryo-ohki jumps for the doorway, but catches a foot on the chair,
dragging it - and Tenchi - through the doorway.  Camera follows the
chair as it rolls through.  Camera tilts upon passing through, and the
chair begins to speed up, suggesting that the lab's floor is currently
at an angle to gravity.  Ryo-ohki steers the chair around various large
pieces of lab equipment, some moving, some not.  After many near
misses, gravity returns to normal and the chair quickly screeches to a
stop.]

[Pause music.]

Ryo-ohki: Miyaaaa!

[Camera lingers on Tenchi as he begins to wake up, then shifts to show
his point of view: Washu standing next to a pile of carrots.]

Washu: Cabbits love carrots.

[Music resumes as we cut to Ryo-ohki chowing down on the pile while
Washu straps the still-too-groggy-to-resist Tenchi to her table.]

[Fade to "Nissan Agricultural" logo.]
