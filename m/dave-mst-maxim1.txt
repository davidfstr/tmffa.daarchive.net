Deep in the darkest recesses of the earth, there exists a place that many
are unsure of even exists, and that facts known by those that know are
few and far in between.  What is known however, is that weird stuff goes
on there, and it aint fun.  20 miles beneath the surface of the Earth,
there lies....

MST THEATER #3
A Grindhouse Productions Production
*********
The scene is set like this: Hawk with Ryoko at a table, eating hot dogs.
Dave showing off his new hot pants to Kekito, the female love interest of
Meguyo from the obscure series "Boy!"(TM).  Suddenly....

<Hawk> (Eating hot dogs) Sometimes I feel like a one-legged man in an ass
kicking contest
<Kekito> For the last time Dave, I dont want to see the gecko camouflaged
against your pants!!
<Dave>(Whining) But it really is....
<Hawk> (Suddenly in the control room for no reason) AND NOW FOR A
REDICULOUSLY
                POINTLESS SELF INSERTION FIC !!!! I CAN ONLY TALK IN CAPS
!!!
<Dave> Whoa, that was quick.  Arent you going to tell us what it is
before telling us its pointlessly stupid?
<Ryoko> All fanfics are pointlessly stupid.  For chrissake, its people
writing stories about CARTOON CHARACTERS
<Dave> Not the X-Files fanfics.  They're about real
people....playing.....fake people....
<Hawk> (Suddenly back in the room) Doth any person want to knowest what
be-eth our fic?  I canst only talketh in Latin.
<REAL Hawk> Hey. What the hell are you doing out of the cage !!!! (Grabs
fake Hawk)
<Kekito> Ok, this is just stupid now.
<Real Hawk> Help me out here will ya?
<Ryoko> No problemo! (Chucks fake hawk into cage)
<Dave> Nice.  So Hawk, whats our fic for today?
<Hawk>  A scintilating bit of sandskrit known as "A new Friend"
<Kekito> Wait, isnt that the one by Phaw?
<Dave> Oh my god.....
<Ryoko> Not this bastard again!
<Kekito> Isnt this the guy that has Maxim?
<Hawk> Yep.  Brace yourselves for MAXIMum stupidity!!

Warning klaxons go off everywhere.  MSTers scream and start running in
all directions.
<Computer voice> Warning: T minus 10 seconds to fan fic.
<Hawk> Get ready!
<Dave> Get set!
<Kekito> (Deadpan) Get bent

TIME FOR THE SHOW!!!!
*****************

A New Friend???

<Ryoko> Its always a possibility
<Dave> Not with Phaw
<Hawk> What kind of name is Phaw anyway?
<Kekito> A name to inspire fear and loathing
<Hawk> Only in Las Vegas

      I don't own any Tenchi character. They all belong to
someone else, I'm just borrowing them for this story. I do
though, own Maxim,

<Dave> This dork owns an entire magazine publication?!
<Kekito> I think theres a catch here....

he is of my own creation.

<Kekito> See

    720 years ago.....
      An object is flying towards earth, it is a sleek, white pod
object.

<Hawk> The space chicken invasion has begun!!
<Ryoko> Aieeee!!!

It has a mysterious cargo inside.

<Kekito> No doubt the author's brain
<Dave> I'll be that could fit an inside an egg

It stalls a little before starting the downward spiral towards Earth.

<Hawk> I think hes referring to the plot

It  crashlands in a heavily forested, mountainous area in Japan.

725 years later....

<Ryoko> Wasnt it 720 years ago that the first thing happened?
<Dave> Yeah, were five years into the future
<Hawk> That would make Tenchi around 22 years old and STILL living with
his parents
<Kekito> I bet he'd do that anyway

  Tenchi Masaki is walking towards his friend Washuu's lab.

<Ryoko> Washu's a friend?  I thought she merely tolerated his presence!
<Dave> Naw, thats TV Washu.  You get that impression from her because she
never says anything to Tenchi

 Tenchi: I wonder what Washuu is doing.... (Goes inside)

    He sees Washuu staring at a map.

<Dave>(Tenchi) Uh oh, Washu's gotten one of those staring spells again
<Hawk> Its just the brain aneurysm, nothing serious
<Ryoko> Thats what you get when you stare at computer screens all day
long
<Dave> Hmm......that would be a problem for me

  Tenchi: What's the matter Washuu? Why are you looking at that
map for?
Washuu: Oh! Hi Tenchi, I've picked up an old signal from inside
the forest surrounding    us.
  Tenchi: Do you know what it is? Nothing dangerous I hope.

<Kekito>(Washu) Dont worry, its probably just some old pervert in the
forest with a Hamm radio
<Dave> That would explain teh "old signal" phenomenon

Washuu: Hardly, it's just out there. Seems to be a very old
signal. At least 700 years old.
  Tenchi: (Insert drop) 700 years!!!!
Washuu: Yep you're right. So.... do you want to go investigate?
  Tenchi:  Well, okay. Are you sure about this Washuu? This could
be a bomb or something.

<Ryoko> When was the last time you saw a 700 year old bomb?
<Kekito> Dont worry, its just Tenchi being stupid

Washuu: C'mon Tenchi, it'll be exciting.

   They enter the forest... Washuu is using tracking equipment.

<Hawk> If you havent noticed already, 3rd person narration does not make
for an interesting story
<Ryoko> 3rd person narration....for those with no writing talent
<Dave> Same things as self-inserts and MSTs
<Hawk> Dave, you just burned yourself
<Dave> How?
<Hawk> You've done a self insertion AND a MST already!!
<Kekito> I think our fearless MSTing leader just got a self-whuppin

  Washuu: It's over there.
    Tenchi: Let's go see what it is.

<Dave> (Washu) No, not that way you fool!

    They find the pod object half-submerged in the ground.

<Hawk> Invasion of the body snatchers anyone?

 Washuu: Here it is!
    Tenchi: Well? What now?

<Dave> Incredibly cheesy plotline?
<Hawk> Ridiculously over powered assholes?
<Kekito> Author glorifying himself  to fulfill a silly fantasy that he
knows will never come true for the fact that hes a social outcast?
<Everyone> ??
<Kekito> Self insertion, its what its all about
<Dave> Not MY self insertion

Washuu: Hold on....

     Washuu taps some buttons on her computer..

<Hawk> Washu and her computer....
<Ryoko> I wonder if she ever uses that thing to access Cyberotica.com
<Dave> She doesnt need to.  She can create her own pleasures

   Pod disappears.

   Tenchi: Where'd it go?
 Washuu: I just put it in my lab.
   Tenchi: That was very quick, at least I didn't have to dig it
up.

  They arrive back at the Masaki Residence. Ryoko and Ayeka are
fighting (Yet again).

<Kekito> Yet again, another overly used stupid cliche'

   Tenchi: WILL YOU TWO JUST STOP IT!!

    Ryoko and Ayeka freeze....

<Hawk> Oh my god!  3 separate people just broke character simultaneously!
<Ryoko> Its OOC madness!!

   Ryoko: Oh! Hi Tenchi, how's it going today?

<Ryoko>(Tenchi) Oh, nothin' much.  Just found another weird pod outside
that just happened to land right in this very area
<Dave>(Ayeka)Oh, not AONTHER one!  Thats the 12th this month!!

   Tenchi: We just found this wierd pod. Come see it, and try not
to fight.

  Ryoko: Okay. (Lying)

     Sasami enters the house...  Ryo-ohki follows.

   Sasami: What's going on?
    Ayeka: Tenchi and Washuu found a strange object.


   Later on....

    Everyone is looking at the pod.

   Tenchi: So what is it Washuu?
 Washuu: This is an old Chryopod, used before I was imprisoned
and sent here 700 years ago.

<Hawk> At Safeway, your egg-shaped pods will always be fresh

   Ryoko: So let's open it.

<Dave> No Ryoko, you'll have to wait for Christmas morning

 Washuu: Hold on, these were used to hold food, supplies, and
inter-galactic criminals.

<Kekito> I sure hope not all at once
<Ryoko> So pods used to house dangerous inter-galactic criminals are just
sent out to amble through space?
<Hawk> Man, the justice system of the future sucks

Ayeka: So don't touch anything Ryoko.
   Ryoko: What's that supposed to mean?

<Dave> It means, dont touch anything Ryoko

 Ayeka: You'd push that button without any second thoughts.
 Washuu: I'm picking up life signs inside. Someone's inside.

<Ryoko> That last phrase came straight from the Department of Redundancy
Department

Ryoko: Let's see what's in inside. (Pushes a button on the
pod)
   Ayeka: See what I was saying Ryoko? You never listen.

   Pod opens with a hiss, steam fills the room.

<Dave> Looks about right for the obligatory steamy love scene
<Kekito> With Phaw, you can guarantee it

  Tenchi: What's inside?
Washuu: We'll find out.

   Coughing is heard inside the pod...

      Voice: Shit! How long have I been in here?
     Tenchi: Hello?
      Voice: Yes? What do you want?
     Tenchi: Are you alright?
      Voice: Of course I'm alright!!!
     Tenchi: Umm... need help?
      Voice: No, I can get myself out.

<Hawk> Is it just me, or were those sentences strung together very
weirdly?
<Ryoko> Stuff like this happens when you get an inflated SI head

A man walks out.... he has greenish-blue hair, a grey goatee,
and is wearing battle armor.

<Kekito> Since when do inter-galactic criminals wear battle armor?
<Hawk> And have facial hair different from their regular hair color?
<Dave> The champagne's not Corbel?

   Man: Hello, I'm Pat! Just plain old Pat! Just Pat... okay?

<Ryoko> Its time for androgyny...
<Everyone> Its Pat!!!

Tenchi: Okay. Hi Pat.
  "Pat": How's it going?
Ayeka: Pleased to meet you Pat. I'm princess Ayeka of Jurai.
  "Pat": Jurai?
Ayeka: Yes... why? Are you from there?
  "Pat": No, I just know an awful lot about stinkin' Jurai.... I
mean heavenly Jurai.(Smiles)

<Kekito> Ayeka, meet Mr. Conspicuous.  Mr. Conspicuous, Ayeka

Ayeka:(Inesrt drop)...... ??
Ryoko: So Pat... are you a criminal?
  "Pat":(Insert two drops) Me? Aw no! I'm just a humble....
merchant yeah, I'm  a merchant.
Sasami: Hi Pat. I'm Sasami, Ayeka's sister.

<Hawk> (Maxim) Hey Sasami, how'd you like me to "Merchandise" you?
<Ryoko> (Sasami) You're a doo doo head!

"Pat": Please to meet you aquaintance.

  Kiyone and Mihoshi enter lab....

<Dave> And have hot, freaky, lesbian sex!!
<Hawk> Everyone, meet Dave, Thomas Doscher Junior

Tenchi: Hey Kiyone, meet Pat.

<Everyone> Its Pat!!

 He was locked in this Chryopod
and we let him out.

<Ryoko> For being such a good puppy

  Ayeka: Kiyone and Mihoshi belong to Galaxy Police.
    "Pat":(Insert three drops) Galaxy Police?
 Kiyone: Wait, I think I've seen you before.
    "Pat": Heh heh, what do you mean???

   Kiyone pulls out her ID, and scrolls through GP files....

     Kiyone: He is not Pat.
      Tenchi: What?

     Kiyone shows a picture of  "Pat". It says WANTED above the
picture and the name reads: Maxim.

<Hawk> (Kiyone) Whoops!  Gotta keep my magazines outta the GP files!
<Kekito> I wonder what other magazines she keeps in there

        "Pat": So you found out that I was lying. What are you
going to do about it? Okay, My name is Maxim. What do you plan to
do with me?

<Everyone> Love you!


    Kiyone: He is charged with accounts of: Murder in the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 9th degree, Homocide, premeditated
murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, wanted
mass destruction,

<Ryoko> Its WANTON you idiot!!
<Dave> This guy must've slept through High School English
<Hawk> I doubt hes ever been to a high school
<Kekito> Or speaks English!

 concealed weapons, drug smuggling, unjust
lanuage, and worldwide manslaughter. He's a Bounty Hunter,
Assassin, and Criminal.

<Hawk> (Maxim) But only on the weekends.  In my spare time, Im a
freelance gardener and author of children's books.

We's wanted by the Jurai Royal Family,

<Everyone> 0_0
<Dave> Did he just say "We's"??!!!
<Hawk> Maxim's a hick!!

Galaxy Police, and 50
other races. He's also the best Bounty Hunter ever known.
     Tenchi: Anything else?
    Maxim: I've also killed over 166890 people in my life time.

<Kekito> But whos keeping count anyway?

I've done search and retrieve, stakouts, snipering, drug
smuggling, and everything that the good book tells you not to.

<Dave> (Maxim) Im also a master of humility
<Ryoko> (Groans) He sure is
<Hawk> Gawd, Im already tired of this crap, lets take a break
<Kekito> Agreed
They do
***************
The MSTers exist the halls of the theater.   Hawk is caught in a gooey
death trap of bubblegum mixed with 700 year old soda.  He is soon freed,
but may never be the same again.

<Ryoko> Man, the crapiness of this fic is gonna make the ending torture
session all the more sweet
<Hawk> Yeah, its too bad we have to do this again with Phaw's next fic,
"Adjusting to Maxim"
<Kekito> Theres two of these??!!
<Dave> Err...not quite
<Kekito> Whaddya mean, not quite?
<Dave> Theres six
<Everyone 'ceptin Dave> Ho....lee......SHIT
<Dave> Yep, thats what I thought at first too
<Ryoko> We have to MST this author's shit 5 more times??!!

<Dave> No time for that!  We gotsta get back!
And so they do
***************

 Kiyone: He's also gone under the aliases of: Kaz, Ricki
Ticki, Mike Hawkins, and Pat.
    Maxim: I hate Jurais, Royal Families, and the like. But I do
like girls, beer, hunting and fishing.

<Hawk> Its official, Maxim's a hick
<Kekito> Yep, he may like girls, but girls certainly dont like him
<Ryoko> Hell yeah
<Dave> I bet he likes pro wrestling and tractor pulls too

Kiyone: And I'm taking you in!(Pulls out gun)
    Maxim: That's a joke right??

<Ryoko> We all had a good laugh with that one

Kiyone: Now come with me.
    Maxim: You think I'm scared?
    Kiyone: Now come along. Or I'll have to shoot.
    Maxim: Go ahead, do it! Fire, open that up and have at it!!
Right in the chest.

<Dave> I dont think Maxim quit realizes that HES being shot at here
<Ryoko> I dont think he quite realizes that hes a complete asshole either

   Kiyone fires....

    Maxim is still standing.

   Kiyone fires again.

     Bullet hits an energy shield around Maxim.

<All> ...........
<Ryoko> RIPOFF!!!!

 Tenchi: He's.... He's.... like..
   Ayeka: Ryoko!!
   Maxim: You're playing with big game now. This game fights
back. So how do I say this in the right way?....Run.

<Ryoko> HES EVEN STEALING MY LINES NOW!!!
(Starts firing at the screen)
<Dave> Settle Ryoko, settle.  Its just a fan fic, its just a fan fic
<Ryoko> That...fucker....stole....my.....best line from the TV series!!!!


Everyone is gone in under 5 seconds.....

<Kekito> Hmph, Meguyo smashed that asshole Dotre in under 5 seconds
<Ryoko> How?
<Kekito> Dotre had me in a locker, and ol' Megy just punched right
through it!  I love that guy...

 Maxim: Wow!! They're fast. Time to go have some fun.

     Everyone runs out towards the lake....

<Hawk> Time for a beach party!
<Dave> Just remember, its parte'

     Ryoko: Is he still behind us?
     Tenchi: Are you scared of him Ryoko?

<Hawk> Neil, did you eat your chunky soup?

Ayeka: He has the same powers as you do.(Smirks)

<Dave> But hes NOWHERE as hot as Ryoko
<Ryoko> Hmm, maybe you're not such a bastard after all
<Dave> Appreciate it

  Ryoko: Are you crazy?? He's Maxim! That greatest Bounty
Hunter ever... makes
        other bounty hunters look like fools and beginners
compared to him.

<Kekito> Another brilliant remark from the Department of Redundancy
Department

     Maxim appears...

     Maxim: Time to die.... so very sorry!
     Tenchi: Alright, I'm tired of playing chicken!

<Dave> Its OOC mania again!
<Hawk> Tenchi grew a spine!

      Tenchi steps foward, weilding the Tenchi-ken.

      Maxim: You know you can't win. I am superior in everything,
you'd be wiped off the face of the planet....

<Kekito> Wow, Phaw has the amazing ability to use 2 different tenses int
eh same sentence
<Dave> Its uncanny!
<Hawk> Its amazing!
<Ryoko> Its a lot of bunk!

yet you have a spirit that I haven't ever seen. Besides, I wasn't serious
about
killing you guys.

<Hawk> (Maxim) I actually couldn't

  Ayeka: What?
      Maxim: I've had 725 years to reflect on my life, I want to
lead a straight life, redeem myself of all sins. Live an honest
life, well most of the time, maybe get a wife, see this whole
world. So what do you say?

<Dave> (Tenchi) Well Maxim, you're a murderer, a criminal, a drug
smuggler, and an all around dickhead, but you did want to turn your life
around for no reason, so you can stay
<Ryoko> (Herself) Wow Maxim, I used to hate you to the depths of my soul,
now you've fully redeemed yourself in my eyes!
<Kekito> (Ayeka) Wow Maxim, you just spit on my family line and entire
heritage, but I just cant help loving you after that heart warming little
speech you gave!
 <Hawk> (Ryo-oh-ki) Meow!

Tenchi: Well, it was nice to meet you Maxim, I wish you
luck and many good times on your long trip. Stop by any time.
      Maxim: Huh?
      Tenchi: You're leaving right?
      Maxim: Leave? Heck no! I'm living here, with you guys.

      Ayeka faints....

      Maxim: You've shown such nice hospitality, and you seem
like a good bunch of people. So I'm staying till my dying days!
      Tenchi: Oh man! Another alien?? In my house?
      Maxim: So what's for dinner? Steak I hope.

<Hawk> Considering that steak costs almost 5 dollars a pound in Japan, Im
sure the Masaki household can afford it on an architect's salary!



THE END

<Everyone> Free at last!!
<Dave> That was a pointless load of shit if I ever saw one!
<Hawk> Yeah, the author must really be a loser if he has to give himself
an ego boost with THAT character!
<Kekito> Enough gabbin' guys, ON WITH THE TORTURE!!

Enter the torture room.  Or good friend Maxim is bound by his arms and
legs to a chair.  Enter Polic Style interrogation, only with more
torture.

<Dave> So Maxim, how are ya feeling today?
<Maxim> I am so going to kick your ass.  Im the strongest badass in the
galaxy and Im gonna really whup up on ya!
<Kekito> Oh really?  Check his hands Ryoko, we'll see how tough you
really are Mr. Maxim...
<Ryoko> (Checks his hands) Smooth as a baby's ass
<Hawk> So, looks like our Mr. "Tough Guy" here has never actually done a
day of work in his life!
<Maxim> You're full of shit!  We's wanted by over 50 different races!
<Dave> There you go again with the "We's" thing.  Well, we have ways of
making you admit yourself (Hooks up special MST Theater #3 torture
device)
<Ryoko> Oh my god!! Not the....
<Kekito> Not the hose hooked up to his mouth connecting directly to the
sewage treatment plant!!
<Dave> The very same
<Hawk> Now Mr. Maxim, heres how this works.  You tell us a lie, you get a
face full of shit, just like you gave the poor readers of this fic.  Now
Ryoko, ask him the questions
<Ryoko> #1: How many people have you killed in your lifetime?
<Maxim> Over 166890 in my life!! (Face full of shit)  Oh my god!!
Dave> Tsk, tsk, you dont learn very well, do you?  Maybe those former
professions you claim to have had are going to your head, continue Ryoko
<Ryoko> #2: What occupations have you held in the past?
<Maxim> I've been a professional assassin, a drug smuggler, a.. (Face
full of shit) *glub**glub* OK! OK! I once worked as a convenience store
clerk at a gas station in Arizona!!
<Ryoko> #3: How many women have you had in your lifetime?
<Maxim> At once?  Or over my entire life?(Face full of shit) *glub**glub*
OK! OK! Zero!! I admit it!!
<Ryoko> 4th and final question: Why are you such an asshole?
<Maxim> Im not!! (More shit) *glub**glub* ENOUGH!! I just want people to
like me!!
<Dave> I think we're done here...
<Kekito> Poor bastard, tortured with his own contrived bull shit
<Hawk> How ironic
