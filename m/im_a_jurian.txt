Disclaimer: Tenchi and his multiple
lady freinds are property of big pimpin'
AIC and Pioneer who are responsible for
most Anime prostitution in down town Tokyo.
I am a poor hobo living on a park bench.
Conclusion: "I know my place."

YES I KNOW, I KNOW ANOTHER AYEKA SONG!!
But in this one Tenchi HAS CHOSEN RYOKO
and Ayeka is now trying to get on without
him so try to grin and bear it.
Ayeka fans can still enjoy it, I hope.
Anyways, if your minds made up you can 
chance a reading.

	I'M A JURIAN

So Tenchi chose Ryoko
I won't be bitter
I thought that I'd lose the power without you
But I'm fitter
Though I'd give up to Sesami 
Got a sitter
Thought my hair would fall out 
But it's growin'
Thought I'd lose my headband
But it's glowin'
Thought that I'd be limp without you
I'm still supple
Thought I'd have no men without you
I got a couple
Thought I'd go grey without you
I'm still purple

I'm a jurian (what), 
I'm not gonna take it (what)
I'm not gon' drop (what), 
I'm gonna whip harder (what)
I'm a jurian (what), I'm not gonna lose it (what)
I'm a jurian (what), my power is thrivin' (what)

Thought I'd be ill without ya, 
But I'm better
Thought that I'd be dry without ya, 
But I'm wetter
Thought I'd quit the job without ya,
I'm still Anime
Thought I'd turn to girls wothout ya,
I'm still not gay'
Thought I'd be weak without
I'm still fightin'
Thought that I would kill ya
Like in the writin'
But now I see I can't hurt hurt ya
I'm not frightened
Of Ryoko and your marriged
I'm enlightened

I'm a jurian (what), 
I'm gonna dry up (what)
I'm not gon' sob (what), 
I'm gonna stand taller (what)
I'm a jurian (what), I'm gonna love it (what)
I'm a jurian (what), never go cryin' (what)

I'm hopin' you never wince 
And that you'll be a prince
Won't be lynched, because since
Some said you would mince
(I'm more noble than that)
I'm not gonna ruin your wedding and life
(I'm more noble than that)
I'm not gonna lie on you or your lovely new wife
(I'm more noble than that)
I'm not gonna hate her or try to be obscene
(I'm more noble than that)
I'm not gonna try to be like her and dye my hair green
(I'm more noble than that)
You know I'm not going to order you from the thone 
where I'm sat
('Cause my two mamas brought me up better than that)

I'm a jurian (Sesami: What?), 
I'm gonna stand up (Kiyone: What?)
I'm not gon' sleep with that cop (Mihoshi: What?!), 
I'm gonna look harder (Ryoko: For what?)
I'm not a pirate (Nagi: What?), not gonna fake it 
(Tenchi: WHAT?!!)
I'm a jurian (What), never go sighin' (Yosho: What?)

After all the movies and OAVs
Soon comes a new thing with T.V    
If I surround myself with other weird people,
And get a new series

I'm a jurian (what), 
My power's inside me (what)
I'm not gon' flop (what),
I'm gonna be stronger (what)
I'm a jurian (what), never go lyin' (what)
I'm a jurian (what), and I'm sick of rhymin' (what)

I'm a jurian (what), 
I'm gonna live up (what)
My song won't stop (what), 
I'm gonna sing louder (what)
I'm a jurian (what), so hot I'm fryin' (what)
I'm a jurian (what), found a new guy now 
(Nobiyuki: Who? I mean...what?)

FIN

There we go again. I know it isn't too
different from the original but I assure
you I changed every line- the lyrics
for Survivor are very hard to parody.
