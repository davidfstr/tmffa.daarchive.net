(chourus sings)
In the anime dimension,
Somewhere in outer space.
A group of losers who said too much
Are stuck at Quatre's place.
Mr. Winnner has made himself a pledge,
After he was pushed beyond the edge.
The Gundam pilot laughs in glee
And carries out his plan of insanity!!!

(Quatre:  I'll break you!!!)

Quatre:  (singing)  I'll send them cheesy fanfics
The worst I can find!  (Quatre's minions singing) La-la-la!
They'll have to sit and watch them all, 
'caust I'm unkind!  (Quatre's minions singing) La-la-la!

(chorus sings)
They'll travel around the galaxy
And see all kinds of peeps
They'll fight to keep their sanity,
and this time it's for keeps!

LOSER ROLL-CALL!:

TIM!
Tim:  It's mayhem time!

SPIKE!
Spike:  Let's jam!

MARK!
Mark:  Let's get this show on the road!

AND GEEEEEEEENE!
Gene:  Let's goooooooo!

(chorus sings)
If you're wondering how you can watch
Something you can read, (Quatre's minions singing) La-la-la!
Just remember you can use you're mind
So let it take the lead,
for Voyages of the Winner Queen!

::we see the main living area and Mark is walking
in reading a book::

Mark:  ::finally noticing the viewers::  Oh hey there everybody.
Quatre finally gave us a break and everyones asleep.  I thought
I'd pass the time to read this book called "Magic For Dummies"
I figure if I learn how to do this stuff, I could get us back to 
Earth.

::Gene comes into the living area, barely awake::

Mark:  Gene, come here a minute.  I need a subject to test
this magic stuff on.

Gene:  ::still barely awake:: ...allright..::snores::

Mark:  Ok...here goes nothing.  ADFIAOGLJFLKFHGGUHAGABLE!!!

::Gene turns into a toaster::

Toaster Gene:  HEY!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS!?  TURN ME BACK NOW!!!

Mark:  Ok...glad to know it works.  ALABABUABFLFHGYALKGUABALE!!!

::Gene turns back to his normal self::

::Tim walks in::

Tim:  Hey, what's with the pink smoke?

Mark:  I'm learning magic...watch this...hold still Gene.

Gene:  Not again...

Mark:  ADFIAOGLJFLKFHGGUHAGABLE!!!

::Gene turns into a toaster again::

Tim:  Cool!  Can you turn him back too?

Mark:  Sure...ALABABUABFLFHGYALKGUABALE!!!

::Gene turns back to his normal self::

Gene:  That's really starting to piss me off!

::Spike walks in::

Spike:  What's all the racket?

Tim:  Mark's learning magic.  Show him, Mark.

Gene:  Oh, no you don't...

Mark:  ADFIAOGLJFLKFHGGUHAGABLE!!!

::Gene turns into...you got it...a toaster::

Spike:  That's a neat trick.  Can you reverse it?

Mark:  Sure can...ALABABUABFLFHGYALKGUABALE!!!

::Gene turns back to his normal self::

Gene:  Grrrr....If I had a Caster shell on me...you would
be dead.

::Quatre shows up on the big screen::

Quatre:  I don't have time for the usual crap so I'll get to
the point.  Duo has been kidnapped by another MSTer.  I've
tracked his location but its going to take a while to get there.
So in the meantime, I have a fic for you to watch.  It's called
Pirate Club.  Have fun!

>Pirate Club

Mark:  Where everyone goes to make weak and puny people walk off the
plank!

>by Aaron Bastin - kakapo101@hotmail.com

Tim: ::Imitating monkey.::  Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, kakakakapopopopo!

>synopsis: Crossover fic combining Tenchi and Fight Club

All:  Thank the Lord!  No lemon!

>Disclaimer:  Tenchi Muyo! belongs to other people.  So does Fight Club.

>Please don't sue me.  I's funny.

Spike:  That did not make sense to me.  Was he saying that "It's funny",
"I'm funny" or what?

Gene:  Only the author knows.

>Pirate Club

Tim:  The first rule about Pirate Club is that you say the title twice!

Spike:  The second rule about Pirate Club is that you say the title twice!

>People are always asking me if I know the space pirate Ryoko.

Mark:  I know somebody who knows somebody that knows Ryoko.  Does that count?

>"Three minutes," she says, checking the ship's chronometer.  "Any words to 
>mark the occasion?"

Mark:  Note to self, make a note to self every three minutes.

>"Nhhhh," I say.  With an energy blade half an inch from your lips you speak 
>only in whispers.

>"Sorry?" she says, moving it away.

Gene: (as whoever it is)  I said "Nhhh!"  Clear enough for you?!?!?!?!?!

>"I cannot think of anything."

Tim:  Not after hitting that smack you can't.

>"Things are getting exciting now," she sighs, walking to the porthole.

Spike:  Any second that porthole will blow and the fic will be over.

Mark:  Spike, the chances of that happening are nil.

>Below, Jurai's massive shipyard twinkles, hanging in the darkness.
>In about two and a half minutes plasmitic explosives will go off, detonating
>the reactors and destroying the entire facility.  I know this, because Ryoko 
>knows this.

Gene:  Is this some kind of Buddhist thing?  Knowing what another one knows?

Spike:  I really have no idea.

>For a second I forget about everything that's happened and wonder if that 
>light sword gives off any dangerous radiation.

Mark:  Actually it's a bar of plutonium.

>And then I realize...Ryoko, the sword, the plasmitic charges...this all had 
>something to do with a man called Tenchi Masaki.

Gene:  What doesn't have to do with Tenchi Masaki?

------

Tim:  Incoming!!!!  We've got incoming lines!

>Sasami clung to my shoulder, crying.  "We're still Jurians, aren't we?" she
>sniffled.

Gene:  (as Sasami)  You're breaking up with me?!?

>"Yes.  We're Jurians.  Jurians is what we are."

Mark:  "We are life forms from planet Jurai.  We all come from that heap of
dirt called Jurai.  We are of the nation Jurai.  Imperial Juraian..."

Spike:  That's enough.

>She was a minor Jurian noble, like me, trying to escape the mindless grind 
>of life at court.

Tim:  A princess is MINOR nobility?  I don't think so!

>She wrapped her arms around me, sighing.  "It's okay.  You cry now.  You'll 
>feel better."

Spike:  "It's not like I meant to put all those scorpions in your bed."

>No, wait.  Let me start earlier.

Gene:  You better.  I have no idea what's going on.

------

Spike:  This is like that bounty hunt on Mars that one time.  All the bullets
were flying, man.

>Like so many others, I had become a slave to the fawning, preening hordes 

Spike:  The hellspawn.

>that thrived in Jurai's royal court.

>You stop paying attention to anything but the millions of little intrigues
>that go on under the polite surface.  Nothing's real...everything is a mask,
>covering a mask, covering a mask.

Mark:  Covering more masks!

>"No," said the Tsunamic preist hearing my confession, "you can't die of 
>boredom."

Tim:  You can die of no sex or porn, though.

>"Listen," I told him, "I cannot bear any more.  Can you not do anything for 
>me?"

Tim (as lady):  Anything at all in the whole wide world!?

>"I'm afraid not, my Lady."

Tim:  Really?

Gene: (as Tsunamic priest)  I'm sorry but I stopped trafficing drugs a long
time ago.

Tim: Juggling acts?

Gene:  No.

Tim:  Babysitting?

Gene: (sounding a little more annoyed) No...

Tim:  Smuggling?

Gene:  FOR THE LAST TIME, NO!!!!!!!!!

>"I am going insane, do you understand that?" I shrilled.

Mark:  (as lady)  Look!  I'm mutilating myself now!  ::Pulls out a paper towel
and somehow tries to impress it upon everyone that it is a knife.::

>He sighed.  "You want to see insane?  Fly over to sector four, Sol system, 
and take a look at the primitives that live there.  THAT'S insane."

------

Mark:  Limbo.  How low can you go?

>I became addicted.

Gene:  Man.  Movies are drug ads nowadays.

>More and more I shirked my duties to hang around on that low-tech little 
>planet, hobnobbing with the pathetically short-lived natives.  It was there 
>that I met Sasami,

Spike:  I know where this is going.  Lemon...

Everyone else:  SHUT UP!!!!!!!

>who was there for similar purposes.  I cried, she cried,

Mark:  We all cried like the little sissies we were.

>I could go back to the courtship feeling refreshed.

Spike:  See?  This is...

Mark: (emphasizing) SHUUUUUUUUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!!!!!

>Saplings aren't this content.

Tim:  I didn't know trees had emotions.

Gene:  There is an inanimate object that has feelings.

Tim:  Really?

Gene:  ::Holds up a box of powdered bleach.::  The sun.

Tim:  NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!

>And he...ruined...EVERYTHING.

Spike:  Sat around and watched TV all day.  Lazy bastard.

>Tenchi.  If I ever discover a black hole, I'll name it Tenchi.

>He was a native,

Tim:  Shooting blowdarts into exploring foreigners.

>perfectly content to work, farming carrots and helping his
>grandfather

>tend the shrine.  No longer could I feel superior to them, no
>longer could I find refuge on Earth.  His contentment exposed my

All:  WHOO-HOO!!!!!!!!!!!

>distress.

All:  AWWWWWWWW, MAN!!!

Gene:  Can we compromise and make distress "undress"?

Mark:  (still reading book)...how to turn people into bowling pins.

Tim:  You're still at this magic stuff?

Mark:  Yeah...I learned a new trick...Gene?

Gene:  Oh shit!  (starts to run)

Mark:  GURENJVHUSAVURNVOISH!!!

::Gene turns into a bowling pin::

Gene:  (angry)  YOU ARE SO DEAD YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

::Spike comes in::

Spike:  Oh wow...Quatre gave us a bowling set...I sure am
glad that I got my bowling ball from the BeBop before it left.

::Spike rolls the ball on the floor and hits Bowling Pin Gene::

Tim:  STRIKE!!!

Mark:  Ok...I think I better change him back.

Gene:  That would be a wise decision!

Mark:  ZNJHGKJSGNFDKJSFNGSAO!!!

::Gene turns back into normal self::

::Quatre appears on the big screen::

Quatre:  We're making a pit stop at Tenrei.  We need to refuel
the ship and I'm going to let Gene get some Caster Shells.
We may need them.

Gene:  You're actually trusting me with that?

Quatre:  I'll send Rashid with you.  He has his own Caster Gun
and will be able to defend himself if you try and escape.

Gene:  Crap!

Quatre:  We still have some time before we arrive at Tenrei...
GET IN THERE AND FINISH WATCHING THAT FIC!!!

::alarm goes off and starts flashing BAD FANFIC ALERT!!!::

Tim:  WE'VE GOT BAD FANFIC ALERT!!!

Mark:  WHAT?!  WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

Gene:  I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

>Once again, I was unable to concentrate, unable to cry, unable
>to sleep.

Mark:  Wow.  So she didn't take a shit either?

Spike:  Damn.  I hope the Tsunamic priest offered her the
name of a good proctologist.

------

Mark:  What the hell is it with the author's use of lines?

>It must have been Startica.

Tim:  Maybe it's Maybeline.

>She was wearing her powder blue kimono.

Gene:  Just the color of this!  ::Moves the powdered bleach box
toward Tim.::

Tim:  NO MORE SUN!!!!!!!!!!!!  AUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!

>"It's time for another round of marriage meetings, dear."

Tim:  I'm your divorce counselor.  Right behind you dear!

>You wake up on Mollidon.

Spike:  Never heard of that place.

>You wake up on Danitan.

Gene:  O_O  Whatever.

>Everything becomes a blur.

Spike:  That's called a hangover.

Gene:  I know that all too well.

>If you woke up at a different time, on a different planet,

Spike:  You would need to drink down prairie oysters all the time.

>could you wake up as a different person?

Gene:  You could wake up with a different person with you in
bed every morning.  ::Nosebleed.::  Does that count?

>I was a princess,

Tim:  Suuuuuure you were.

>doing the rounds of all planets of major power in the galaxy,
>looking for a decent marriage of alliance.

Mark:  Aeka wasn't out to commit incest with Tenchi?  Wow!

>You work out X, how advantageous a marriage would be, and Y,
>how miserable you'd be in a loveless marriage to some foppish
>lordling from whatever backwater planet you happen to be on.

Tim:  If marriage is like math then count me out.

>Also taking into account Q, which is how dangerous he'd be
>if he got his hands on any real political power.

Gene:  Like Bill Clinton?

>	"So if X outweighs Y and Q...you marry him."

Spike:  What about A or S or P of Q

Mark:  SHUT UP!!!!

>	The woman sitting next to me blinked owlishly.

Tim:  She was quite a hooter, too.

Spike:  ::Mallets Tim.::

>"Do you go to many of these meetings?"

Mark:  (a la Monty Python)  Are you a goer?  Nudge nudge
Wink wink.  Know what I mean?  Say no more!

>"More than you can imagine."

Spike:  I can arrest Aeka for prostituion.

Mark:  Aeka's secret life that we never knew.

>She frowned.  "What empire are you a princess of?"

Gene:  Uuuuuum.  Playboy Empire?

Mark:  ::Summoning mallet.::  HGPIUGIUHGIUHLIYUIY!!!!!!

::A giant mallet hits Gene on the head.::

Gene:  :B  DUHDUHDUDUHDUHDUHDDEEEEEEEERRRRR!!!!!!!1

>"A major one."

Spike:  Oooooo.  A major one!  I'll certainly know where
to look that empire up because there are SEVERAL MAJOR
empires in this galaxy!!!

>I used to pray for an accident in hyperspace.

All:  We do, too.  Believe us...

>An attack by Tokimi cultists.

All:  -.-  That line totally sucked.

>Anything.

Tim:  I hope the film breaks again.

>I must have fallen asleep.

Mark:  And never woke up.  The end.

>When I woke up there was a new woman sitting next to me,
>reading the space-liner's safety card.

Gene:  In case of an accident place your head between your
knees and kiss your ass goodbye.

>"Safety procedures.  In the vaccum of space.

All:  ::Cheerfully::  SURE!!!!!!!!

>Yeah, right," she snorted.

Spike:  Some bounty hunters must not be doing their jobs.

>She was exotic looking,

All:  DUHDUHDUHDUHDUHDDER!

>golden cat's eyes

Tim:  Almost like Aisha.  ::Drools.::

Mark:  HGIOJHGYIUYTGKHIUGJIUHIU!!!!!!!!

::Tim gets shocked by 2,000,000 volts of lightning.::

::Tim shakes involuntarily.::

>and spiked blue-green hair.  I smiled, faintly.

All:  "The sun will come out...tomorrow!"

>"So...what do you do?"
	
>"Do?"

>"For a living."


>She smiled, slowly.  "Why?  So you can pretend to be offended,
>call me a woman of loose morals?"

Gene: (as Aeka)  Why...yes!

>"As you wish," I said, looking away.  I heard her low laugh.

>"Okay.  You have a certain sick, desperate look to you."

Spike:  I guess this is Shin Tenchi Muyo.

Mark:  Why is that?

Spike:  Aeka's desperate.

Mark:  Yeah?

Gene:  But what's your point?  She's desperate in all the Tenchi
universes!

Spike:  But she looks like a whore in Shin Tenchi Muyo!

>She pulled a card from her cleavage.

All:  ::Staring.::

>"Pirate," she said.

Mark:  I also dress up as a clown for birthday parties.

>"Hmm?"

Gene:  Aeka really needs to get out more.

>"I'm a space pirate.

Mark:  Hmm?

>Theft, terrorism,

All:  BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  HISS!!!!!!!!  BOOOO!!!!!  STOP THE FILM!!!!!!

::Quatre stops the film.::

Quatre:  What is it?

Gene:  The film says the "T" word!  BOOOOO!!!! 

Quatre:  I get it.  Out of respect for the victims of the recent
tragedy the "T" word will be deleted from the rest of this fic.

All:  THANK YOU!!!!

>that sort of thing."

Tim:  Which thing?

>"...(deleted word)?"

>"Hallmark of civilization," she grinned.

Tim:  Prostitution dates back to the most ancient of times.  It
has satisfied businessmen and politicians for millenia!

>"Did you know that the mining planet Ecritore has only one warship
>assigned to guard its space?"

Spike:  Gee.  I guess a whole fleet could push the defense over.

>"No.  Is this true?"

Spike:  Psyche!  I really fooled you didn't I?

>"That's right.

Mark:  I'm just messing with you.

>One can destroy and steal an incredible amount of royal property
>without ever being caught or causing loss of life."

Spike:  What about Sasami when you tried to steal Tsunami for Kagato?

>"Really?"  I squeaked.

Mark:  Since when was Aeka a rat?

>"If one were so inclined."

Gene:  They'd do their homework.

>And that's how I met her.

Tim:  Mrs. Right...

>"Ryoko," I said, reading the card.

Gene:  Pirate and prostitute.

------

Mark:  Sign on the dotted line please...

>Allow me to tell you a little about Ryoko.

Tim:  After what the card said I don't think I want to know anything
else.

>In addition to her 'work' as a pirate, she made money by teleporting
>goods from planet to planet, smuggling.

> ( "We in the industry call it 'blipping'." )

Spike:  That's where we bleep out nasty words for primetime network
television.

>She'd pick up the package,

All:  AAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Mark:  ::Makes muffled vomiting noises.::

>whatever it was, teleport to the designated spot, and disappear again.

Gene:  We never get to see poor Ryoko.

> ( "So why would anyone want this shit job?" )

Mark:  If it pays the rent pal it's a job...

>Well, it afforded her the opportunity to indulge in her hobby...

Tim:  I think I'm interested now.

>random acts of (deleted word) exhibitionism.  She'd do the deliveries naked.

All:  NAKED!?!?!?!??!  WHERE!?!?!?!??!

>So when, say, the High Epopt of the Tsunamic church would receive an
>important package in his office, along with many of his cardinals,
>Ryoko would appear and disappear so fast the image of her body did
>not consciously register.  You do not know you saw it, but you did.

Spike:  Off the record, we saw a naked chick.

> ( "A nice, huge set of tits." )

All:  WHERE?!?!?!?!?!?!?

>Blipping.  You appear, you disappear, and no one is any the wiser.

Mark:  AAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!  MAKE THEM STOP!!!!!

>There was no furniture,

Gene:  Single life is the best life.

>no heat and no privacy - the only water came from a spring deep

Tim:  And the water glowed.  There was also a sign next to the water that said
"Danger:  Radioactive Waste" with a picture of a fan-like thingie on the sign,
too.

Mark:  AGRAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  ::Cries.::

>THE RULES OF PIRATE CLUB

>1. You do not talk about pirate club.

All:  Okay.

>2. You do NOT TALK ABOUT PIRATE CLUB.

Gene:  What is this girl?  A broken record?

Mark:  I think we heard you THE FIRST TIME!!!!!

>3. Two ships to a raid.

Tim:  The store only allows two ships in the store at any one time.
Shoplifting is on the increase.

>4. One raid at a time, guys.

Spike:  Eating too many raids at one time will make you sick.

>5. No ion weapons, no tactical nukes.

Gene:  Heehee.  But you didn't say "No Caster guns"

>6. Raids go on as long as they have to.  If the target surrenders,
>loses life support or jettisons its cargo, the raid is OVER.

Spike:  Umm.  I don't think a helpless ship would voluntarily
participate in Pirate Club.

Mark:  My thoughts exactly.

>7. If this is your first night...you have to raid.

Tim:  -.-  Okay.  Get on with it.

------

Mark:  ::Involuntarily shakes.::

Tim:  Somebody better get Mark's mind off those lines quickly.
I think we're going to lose him.

Mark:  ::Shaking.::  I LIKE BOOGERS!!!!!!  DUHDUHDUHDUHDUHDDER!

Spike:  SHUT UP!!!!! ::Plugs ears.::  LALALALALA!!!!!!

>"I had the oddest dream last night," I said.

Gene:  Here goes.

>"Everything about last night was odd," said a deep male voice behind me.

Tim:  Aeka sure gets around.

>I turned around slowly.  Tenchi stood there, wearing a pair of jeans and an 
>odd smile on his face.

Spike:  Tenchi happy about sex?  That's out of character.

>"What...what are you doing here?"

Gene:  Get out of here or I'll press charges!

>The grin vanished.  "Wh-what...?"

Tim:  But what about our relationship?

>"Get out!"  I shreiked.  I was wearing only my sleeping attire at the 
>moment - I could feel my face flushing as I tried to cover myself.

Tim:  Aren't you covered already?

>"What on Jurai are you staring at?  OUT!"

Mark:  ::Singing.::  Torn between two lovers...

>"I...I'm sorry," he stammered, and ran out into the light.

>There was a soft hum next to me as Ryoko appeared.  "Man, you got some
>weird friends.  Nice ass, though."

Gene:  Thanks.  Oh, you're talking about Tenchi, aren't you?

>I looked at her.  Carefully.  She was naked, as she often was, and a smug, 
>satisfied smirk clung to her lips.  I knew what had happened before she even 
>told me.

Spike:  Sex with Tenchi.  Ryoko sure must be desperate.

>I sat down, lowered my head to my knees.

Tim:  Aeka's sick.

Gene:  (as Aeka)  Gonna...vomit.  ::PUUUUUUUUKE.::

>"...and then he got - get this - a nosebleed!  Ahh," she sighed,
>stretching.  "But you know what I mean, you jumped him."

All:  STOP IT!  NO SEX WITH TENCHI DESCRIPTION!!!

>"I most certainly did NOT!"

Tim:  Did too.

Others:  SHUT UP!!

>"What, never?" she said, raising an eyebrow.

Spike:  Never ever?

Gene:  Never ever, could be better?

Mark:  If that was to imply what I think it did.  I say SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUP!

>"I am not a woman of loose morals!"

Spike:  (as Aeka)  Today is opposite day.  Oh, yes.  Did I  mention I'm
tired of my life and hallucinating my alter ego?

>"All right, all right!  Relax, would ya?  Just a little fun.  Cherry-picking."
>Her eyes narrowed.  "You're not...y'know...into him, are you?"

>"Tsunami, no!"

Gene:  Liar.  

>"Good.  He's trouble.  Behind that sweet little smile of his is a guy who 
>could wreck you.  Get rid of him."

Mark:  YES!  Finally we can watch Tenchi die a horribly painful death!

Tim:  That's usually not the case.

>"What!"

>"Listen - it'd be better if the two of you don't talk about me, okay?"

Spike:  (as Ryoko)  I'll act like I'm not even here...

>"All...all right."

>"I'll hold ya to that," said Ryoko, who waved her finger at me before 
>vanishing again.

Mark:  Hallucination terminated.

------

Mark:  I...can't...take...much...more...of...THIIIIIIIIIIS!

Gene:  Calm down, Mark!

Mark:  ::Begins casting magic spell.::

Mark:  IHSAIUFHGASIUFHIAHHHFDSKJ!!!!

::An earthquake shakes the theater room.::

Others:  AAAUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!!

::Lights from the theater ceiling fall on everyone's head, except Mark.::

Others:  The pain...ARGH!!!

>At about this time people started showing up at the entrance to the cave.

Mark:  ::Recovered.::  Salesman!

Spike:  (as Aeka)  Ryoko, just spend the money and get a better sword.
This sword just doesn't kill people like it used to.

>"If the applicant stays outside without food, water, sleep or encouragement 
>for three days, they're admitted to Operation Blow Shit Up."  Ryoko explained.

Gene:  Yuck.  Why stick M-80s in a pile of feces and do that?

>"And that is...?"

Tim:  A literal name for this operation.

>Ryoko clucked her tongue, shaking her head and grinning.  "The first rule 
>of OBSU is you don't ask questions, princess," she chuckled, and went out to 
>terrify Sasami, the first applicant.

Tim:  I can see Ryoko putting frogs in Sasami's hair and making her hold bugs.

Spike:  Recruiting standard have really gone down the toilet.  Pun intended.

>Within a month, we had an army.  No one thought to ask what we needed an 
>army for - in Ryoko we trusted.

Gene:  That's not good.  ::Shakes head.::  Uh-uh.

>The cave was cleaned, prettied up.  Long range scanners were installed, along
>with banks and banks of computer systems.  Something was happening, but no one
>seemed to know what.

Tim:  (In the spirit of original MST3k cast)  This is when pranks groups had no
specific purpose.

>Then she disappeared.

Gene:  The end.

>I decided to get very, very drunk.

Mark:  (narrating)  The next morning (switches to Aeka's voice)  TENCHI!  WHAT
ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED!!?!?!?!?!!?

>I was relaxing at the cave mouth with my third bottle of sake when I heard 
>him, his wheezy, wheedling little voice calling out.

Spike:  Perfect description.

>"Ryoko?"

Tim:  (as Tenchi)  I left my chess club jacket here!

>He stumbled into the darkness of the cave, saw me.  Smiled.  Idiot.

Spike:  Yet another perfect description.

>"She's not here."

Gene:  She hates your guts.

>His smile faded.  "What?" he said.

Gene:  (as Tenchi)  I don't recall her in bed with us.

>I sat up, snarling at him.

Tim:  Should we repeat our noises?

Mark:  Why not?

Tim: GGRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

Mark: MOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

Gene: BAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Spike: HOOOOOOOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!!!! 

>"Ryoko is not here.  Ryoko went away.  Ryoko gone.  Understand?"

Tim:  Ryoko all gone.

Gene:  (as Aeka)  In other words I killed her.

Mark:  The "Ryoko gone" phrase sounded like a hillbilly...

Spike:  Or a total drunk.

>His eyes went wide.

Tim:  (as Tenchi)  You're a freak...

>He swiftly turned, and left the cave.

Spike:  (as Aeka)  I'll be calling you for child support!  I mean,
Ryoko will be calling you for child support!

>I could see a few of the scratches that she'd left on his back, and I
>felt very, very jealous all of a sudden.

Tim:  This is sickening.  What kind of sick stuff is happening to Tenchi?

Gene:  It's a violent STD called...

Tim:  Okay.  We don't want to know.

::The others back away from Gene with his apparent knowledge of sexual
diseases.::

------

Mark:  ::Twitching and preparing to cast a spell.::

Gene:  Stop him before casts another spell!!!!

::Too late.::

Mark:  HROIQKJWRPOWQJRPOIU!!!!!!

::A giant wall of fire engulfs the theater.::

Others (except Mark protected by magic):  AUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!!!

::The others are burnt badly.::

Others:  Ow.

>I decided to find her.

Spike:  (as Aeka)  So I called 1-800-THE-LOST

>Ryoko's army was swiftly growing out of control,

Tim:  That pact with hell sure wasn't the right choice.

>nervous without their leader and eyeing me suspiciously.

Mark:  This isn't going to turn into a lemon rape scene is it?

>In the midst of my sake haze I bolted from the cave and leapt aboard the
>Ryo-Ohki, heading towards Danitan.

Spike:  Whatever.

Gene:  The question is wherever.  I don't know where the hell she's talking
about.

>Was I in a daze?

All:  Yes.

>Had I slept?

All:  No.

>Every place I visited gave me the same unnerving sense of deja-vu.  Every planet
>I stopped at had an unusual number of ion trails leading from it, every system
>reported a strange rise in nonlethal piracy.

Spike:  Do the math, Einstein.

>Days passed in a blur - everywhere I went I found myself hot on her trail.

Tim:  500 planets later she gave up.

>I knew how Ryoko thought,

Tim:  She liked pina coladas.

Mark:  And walking in the rain.

>I knew how to find the secret hangars full of pirate vessels, their gun turrets
>still warm, plinking as they cooled from white-heat.

Mark:  Plink?  As in Plinko?  I love that game on the Price is Right!!!

>"They say she's an artificial being, recently released from a subturranean 
>prison."

Mark:  I can make all the references to the rumors that Jet got about Edward.

Spike:  Good for you.  I really don't want to hear it.

>"They say she can make copies of herself, each with the same power.  Is 
>that true?"

Tim:  I hear she can talk with the unicorns.  Is that true?

Mark:  I hear she won lots of beer chugging contests.  Is that true?

Gene:  I hear she can bake great pies.  Is that true?

Spike:  I hear she loves pancakes.  Is that true?

::All act like children.::

All:  IS IT TRUE!?  ISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUE
ISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUEISITTRUE!?!?!?!!??!?

Mark:  ::As old man.::  SHUT UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!

>I glared at the two Valentians facing me.

Gene:  (as Aeka)  You two need a life.

>"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard," I snarled.

Gene:  (as Aeka)  Just take my order, dammit.

>"Is it true what they say?"

Spike:  When will they shut the hell up?  They sound like children with ADD.

>"Is Ryoko going to attack Jurai?"

All:  JESUS CHRIST!  SHUT YOUR DAMNED TRAPS!!!!!

>Had I slept?

Tim:  Great.  Now Aeka has ADD.

>Everywhere I got hints,

Tim (as a member of Pirate Club):  Damn it, lady.  I give up.  You, woman, are
a fucking retard.  I have had chimpanzees that can guess better than you.  And
they can also control their drives to commit incest.

Mark:  Okay, Tim.  We get it.  Aeka's dumb.

>knew I was close, but no one would admit to having seen her.

Spike:  I think people that did it with Ryoko wouldn't keep it a secret.

>Until Mollidon.

Spike:  Another place that doesn't exist on the galactic map.

>I walked into the low, dark bar,

Gene:  Watch your head.

>pushing my filthy hair from my eyes.  I'd been traveling for two weeks straight.

Mark:  It looks like you didn't bathe for two weeks straight, either.

>As I entered, I heard the soft chanting from the back room:

Spike:  (imitating chanting)  All hail Satan, king of the underworld.

>"Her name is Kiyone.  Her name is Kiyone.  Her name..."

Tim:  What a waste.  Kiyone was so fine.

Mark:  That's a Quatre chosen fic for you.

>I shook my head.

>"Can I help you, princess?"

>I turned towards the bar.  There was a white-haired woman polishing a glass 
>there, studying me evenly.

Spike:  There's a winner for you.

>There was a bandage on her face, but the rest of her body was wrapped in a
>voluminous black cloak.

Spike:  Yep...a real winner.

Tim:  Nagi can kick Ryoko's ass.  So what the hell is up with this fic?

>"Have...have we met, miss...?"

>"Nagi."  She frowned.  "Is this a test, m'lady?"

Mark:  (as Nagi)  I didn't study.

>"No.  This is not a test," I bit out.

Tim:  Yes it is.  It's a test of our sanity.

>"When did we meet?"

>"One month ago.  You were standing right there...wanted to know about 
>security.  Tight as Tsunami's undergarments, princess."

Gene:  ::Nosebleed.::  How does she know how tight Tsunami's ungergarments are?

>"Are...are you sure?"

Quatre:  Guys.  I have to take a dump.  Watch the film and suffer.

::The guys ignore the part of the fic and have a conversation.::
-This part of the fic is deleted due the fact we couldn't think of any jokes.-

Gene:  You guys have any hentai doujinshi of Melfina?

Mark:  No.

Tim:  No.

Spike:  I don't do that kind of thing.

Gene:  Damn.

Tim:  You guys want to see who can hit the projection booth with ice from their
drinks?

Spike:  How are we going to do that?

Tim:  With our straws.  Just crunch up the ice and shoot it out like a blowdart

Spike:  Wicked.

Gene:  Kickass.

Mark:  Tim, only someone as insane as you can think of things like this.

Tim:  ::Crunches up ice and shoots it at the projection booth.::

::The ice ricochets off the glass of the projection booth.::

Others:  Go Tim!

::Spike Shoots his own ice at the projection booth and hits the glass.::

Gene:  Lemme try!  LEMME TRY!

::Gene crunches his own ice and shoots it.  Gene hits a part of the glass
and makes a funny image of the fic.  This is because water droplets from
the ice are left on the glass and refract the image.::

::All look at the fic and laugh.::

Mark:  HAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!  LOOK!  Aeka's eyes are melted into on big eye!

Spike:  I can make them look uglier than that.

Gene:  No you can't.

Spike:  Yes I can.

Tim:  I can beat both of you.

Spike and Gene:  YOU'RE ON! 

Mark:  Let the tournament begin!!!

Mark:  First up we have Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop!  He's as
deadly with a straw and ice as deadly as he is with a gun!!!!!!!
::Imitates crowd cheering.::

Spike:  ::Crunches his ice.  After a deep breath he shoots it, hitting
the glass smack in the middle.::

Mark:  Look!  Tenchi has a weird looking leg in that Aeka recall scene!

Tim:  That's not a leg, it's...

All:  ::Pause.::  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHH!!!!

Gene:  ::Pukes up lunch.::

Mark:  Anyway.  Next up is Tim Turner.  He's a nutty guy from Texas that
loves to eat bleach and hallucinate.  He also came up with the idea for this
contest.  So let's hear it for Tim!  ::Imitates crowd cheering.::

Tim:  Thank you!  I like Aisha!

Mark:  Whatever.  Just shoot your ice!

Tim:  ::Shoots his ice and hits the projection booth.::

Mark:  A stunning shot with a really weird looking sun in it!

Tim:  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

Gene:  ::Shaping the ice to fit his straw and REALLY shoot out..::

Mark:  Next up is Gene Starwind!  He's from Sentinnel III but a native of
planet Earth!  He also has a fine chick and a bitchin' ship to boot!
Let's hear it for Gene Starwind!  ::Imitates crowd cheering.::

Gene:  EAT THIS!!!!  ::Blows real hard on his straw and BREAKS the glass
on the projection booth.::

All:  O_O;;  OH SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!

::Quatre can be heard now that the glass is broken.::

Quatre:  Man.  Do I have the Hershey squirts.

Spike:  ::Chuckles.::

Quatre:  ::Straining voice.::  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIT!
::The sound of Quatre relieving himself sounds loudly throughout the theater.::

All:  ::Laughing.::

Quatre:  I heard...DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!!!!!!!!!  ::The sound
intensifies.::

All:  ::Laughing harder.::

Tim:  ::Crying with laughter.::  What the hell?  This is fucking comedy!

Mark:  What the hell did he eat last night?

Gene:  This is new.

Spike:  ::Snickering.::

Quatre:  No more toilet paper!?!?!?!  NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!

All:  ::Finish their laughing as the toilet flushes.::

Quatre:  Who broke the glass?

All:  ::Whistle.::

Quatre:  Never mind.  You guys didn't hear anything did you?  I think the
ship needs repairs.

Spike:  Heheheheheheeeeeeh.  Wwwwwwwipeout!

Tim:  Shut up!

Quatre:  I get that!  So your punishment will be to watch all the fics we've
seen up to date.

Others:  THANKS, SPIKE!

Spike:  Oops...

::The fic continues.::

-------

Mark:  RRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

Spike:  GET HIM!!!!!!

::Again, too late.::

Mark:  OIJHEWFAOIHOWIEHURWOQQEU!!!

::A tornado appears and swirls the others around the theater.  The others
bump into the walls and other objects.::

Others:  AAUUUGH.  Make it stop.  The pain...

>It's called blipping.  You appear and disappear, and no one knows it.

Mark:  Make the F*BLEEP*ING LINES STOP!  AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!

-------

Mark:  AND NOW FOR THE GRAND FINALE!!!!  AAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAAAAAAAA!!

Tim:  Mark.  Calm down.  It's just a bunch of lines...  Take it easy.

Mark:  NO!

Gene:  Don't let Quatre break you.

Mark:  NOOO!

Spike:  I'll hook you up with Faye if you calm down.

Mark:  NNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  AHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAAAAAA!!!!!

Mark:  OJHFWOIHFRHRWOPIWQUYROPJIGDASFDJLKSAES!!!!!

::A HUGE ASS tsunami builds up in the theater and begins to rumble toward the
MSTers.::

Others:  ::Begin to cry.::

Tim:  What did I do to *sniff* deserve this?

Gene:  *Sniffle*  I promise I won't buy anymore porn.

Spike:  ::Lights a cigarette.::

Quatre:  Nature calls again.  I shouldn't have eaten all those beans.

::The MSTers start jabbering while the fic is going::

-Due to stuff that's unMSTable to us again we decided to delete this part.
To the author, no disrespect is intened.  We hope you will understand.-

Mark:  Hey!  I got a few quesions about anime that have me
stumped.

Gene:  Shoot.

Mark:  The first question is...In Poke`Mon, where does Team
Rocket go when they 'blast off'?

Spike:  Good question.  I've been wondering that myself.

Gene:  I got another question...Who the hell is Team Rocket?

Spike:  They're a couple of bad guy rejects that give villians
like Vicious, Frieza, Vegeta, and Hazanko a bad name.

Gene:  Ah.  I see.

Tim:  I KNOW!!!  I KNOW!!!  They go to land of pink bunnies and
where everything spontainiously combusts!!!

Mark, Gene, and Spike:  LAY OFF THE BLEACH, TIM!!!

::the fic goes on::

Mark:  Question number 2...Gene?...What the heck is that stuff that
Melfina is dipped in that let's her activate the Outlaw Star?  I know
its not water so what is it?  And how when she gets out, how does
she dry off so fast?

Gene:  hmm...Well its...You see its like...well, shit...I don't have
a clue.  MELFINA?!

Melfina:  Yes, Gene?

Gene:  You know your tube on the Outlaw Star?  What is that water-like
stuff its filled with?

Melfina:  You got me...I don't even know.

::the fic is still going::

Mark:  And finally, question numero 3...In The Big O, if everyone has
lost their memory, how can R. Dorothy be built?  How can people even
know about a Megadeus?

Spike:  (as Roger Smith...his English voice is Roger Smith anyway)
Humans are adaptable creatures...if they can figure out how electricity
works, they can still have something that resembles a normal life...

Mark:  That still doesn't answer my question.

Tim:  I KNOW!!!  I KNOW!!!  They were abducted by aliens and they had
some brain surgery along with an anal probe!!!

Gene:  Tim...What do aliens and an anal probe have to do with any of this?

Tim:  umm....I don't know.

::Quatre gets back from the bathroom::

Quatre:  Ahh...much better.  Spike?  Remind me never to let you cook
any more.  The bell peppers and beef was not a good combination.

Spike:  Ok...I'll remember that.  ::snickers at the fact that he
put Ex-Lax in the beef::

Quatre:  This fic is almost over...the punishment is about done with.

>	"You met me at an odd time in my career as a princess," I say, and take his 
>hand in mine.  Together we watch as a new sun burns for us.

>END

All:  Thank you.

>AUTHOR'S COMMENTS:  Don't ask me.

Gene:  I didn't write this fic.  Oh, wait, I did.  Never mind.  WAIT, NO! I TAKE
IT BACK!

>I've gone for 35 hours without sleep now,

Tim:  There's the problem right there.

Mark:  It's not like I killed anyone in my period of sleep deprivation.  NO, WAIT!
I DID!  NO, I DIDN'T!!!!

>so I refuse to take responsibility for this.

Spike:  So why is your name on there?

>Hope you liked it.

All:  Thank you for not writing a Sasami sex scene!

>I'm at kakapo101@hotmail.com.

Tim:  ::Imitating monkey again.::  Ooo,ooo,ooo,kakakakapopopopopo!

>Cheers.

All:  To dead body parts, we mean, great fics!

_________________________________________________________

1...2...3...4...5...6...7...

Gene:  Now I'm immpressed.  One of Quatre's fics that actually made sense.

Quatre:  ::On the big screen::  Don't get used to it.  It's just
this one time.  This is an emergency and I couldn't find a
more disturbing one.

Tim:  What emergency?

Quatre:  Someone kidnapped Duo and we need this ship cleaned up.

Spike:  What do you mean someone kidnapped Duo?

Quatre:  Another MSTer.  She teleported him off this ship and
using him as a crew member for another ship.  That's why we're
going to Tenrei to get some armorments.

Spike:  What kind of weapons does this ship have?

Quatre:  ::looking nervous::...weapons?

All the MSTers:  ::facefault and fall down anime style::

Gene:  You mean to tell me that you let this ship leave orbit,
flying into the unknown reaches of the galaxy...

Gilliam:  ::interrupting Gene:: And in the middle of Kei Pirate
territory.

Gene:  ...without having any kinds of weapons on this ship???

::Mark comes into the living area wearing a tuxedo::

Gene:  What's with the fancy get-up?

Mark:  You expect me to meet one of the hottest women in anime
wearing clotes that make me look like a homeless person?

Quatre:  Speaking of which...

Spike:  Uh-oh...

Gene:  Here we go...

Tim:  It's mayhem time...

Mark:  GET ON WITH IT ALREADY!!!!!!

Quatre:  Prepare yourselves for the arrival of our first guest...

::Quatre pushes a couple of buttons on his console::

Quatre:  This lady comes from the Gundam universe in the year
U.C. 0079.  She's the pilot of the mobile armor Apsalus.  A
machine that can beat a Zaku to its knees and take out a
Gundam while it's at it.  She's smart...she's beautiful...
no drooling Mark...

Mark:  ::wipes mouth::  Sorry...

Quatre:  Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you...Aina Sahalin!!!

::a horizontal portal opens up in the middile of the living area::

Quatre:  Wait a miniute!!!!....

::too late...Aina falls throuh the portal.  She's half covered with
a towel::

Quarte::  I forgot to tell you...she just got out of the shower.

Aina:  AAAHHH!!!!  WHERE THE HELL AM I?!

::Gene sticks out his tounge and stares, Spike just turns around,
and Mark faints::

Tim:  DUHDUHDUHDUHDUHDUHDUHDUHRRRRRRRRRRRR  ::gets a powerful nosebleed
that shoots him across the room and into the bulkhead.::

Quatre:  Oh well...see you next time.

::The others walk into the snack bar.::

Tim:  I'm hungry.  What's for dinner tonight, Spike?

Spike:  >)  Bell peppers and beef.

THE END
<Perhaps revenge is best served on a hot plate.>
