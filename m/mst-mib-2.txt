Hello everyone! It's me, Rick "The Mirror Knight" Everts again! Well, I 
finally got those stupid writers out of my room.  They decided that I didn't 
have anything of worth to brake or steal, except a 2 liter of generic brand 
pop. So they took that and left. Well anyway, Here's the second part of the 
MSTing of Tenchi Muyo! Vesus Men in Black! Oh yeah, legal stuff:

We leave off where the last one left off, where Mike and the bots have a 
break in between the crossover segments.

Tom: Hey, ya know Mike, William Benjamin Grilliette is doing a pretty 
good job on this fic so far.
Mike: Yeah, I wonder if Pearl made a mistake?
 
Cut to Castle F.

Pearl: Don't count on it, Nelson! The first part was just an appatizer. Now 
begins the MAIN COURSE!
Pearl, Bobo, and Brain Guy laugh evily. There is a knock at the door.
Pearl: (stops in mid-laugh) Who the hell could that be!? Bobo! Get the 
door!
Bobo squaks, and opens the door. Standing there are J and L from MiB.
Bobo: Yes? Hey! You guys are those Men in Black!
J: Damn it! Ever since that movie came out, everyone can tell who we are!
L: We heard rumors that the owner of this castle has been hiding a illegal 
alien here.
Pearl pushes Bobo out of view, we a crash and Bobo yelps in pain.
Pearl: Illegal aliens? Uh...not here! Isn't that right BOBO?!
Bobo: (dazed from the fall) Uh, sure there is! Ya, know, Brain Guy!
The MiB push their way past Pearl and finds Brain Guy hiding behind a 
table. Pearl glares at Bobo, promising worse punishment to come.
L: Hmmm...an observer! I thought their race was destroyed!
BG: Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! (He gets up and tries to throw the 
MiB's against the wall using his powers, but nothing happens) What the?!
L: We got a high psychic level reading from this castle.  We put on our anti-
psi suits to counteract it just in case this happened.
Pearl: What are you going to him?
J: (pulls out a mean looking hand gun that shifts and turns into a laser rifle) 
You all will have to come down to headquarters with us.
L: (Also armed with gun, and starts waving Bobo, BG, and Pearl to go 
through the door) Come on now, we don't want to have to make any 
messes.
Back to SOL
Crow: Hey! all right! Now we don't have to watch any more of that fic!
Everybody starts cheering

Back to Castle F.

Pearl:  Can I do just one little thing before I leave?
J and L look at each other, then at her.
L: Yeah, but make it quick!
Pearl: I don't know what's going to happen to us, but it can't be as nearly 
as bad as what's going to happen to you!!

Back to SOL

Alarms and Lights go off.

Mike: Fan Fic Crossover sign!
Bots: Auughhhh!

Mike and bots run in different directions.

Act 4

Scene 1

{In Tenchi's room Tenchi sits at his desk working on makeup work from 
the time he spent on Jurai.}
[Mike: I didn't know that Tenchi was in beauty school.]

Tenchi: {Frustrated.} Calculus is a pain.  I'd rather practice with Grandpa.

Sasami: {From downstairs.} Tenchi, time for Ryu-Oh's sap!

Tenchi:  Okay, Sasami!  {Stands and limps downstairs.}

{In the living room Sasami and Nobuyuki stand waiting on him.  Sasami 
applies Ryu-Oh's sap.}

Nobuyuki: {Impatiently.} Tenchi, will you now tell me how you were hurt?

Tenchi: {Uneasy.} Dad, I don't know if I should.  Washu said that you 
shouldn't know.  It could be difficult to understand.
[Tom: Yeah, fighting a time-traveling, diminsion hopping, A-1 class criminal, 
going back in 
time, finding out that Mom died early because she had to expend her life energy 
to save my 
butt, yeah, you wouldn't understand....ooops..heh..heh, forget I said all 
that...]

Nobuyuki: I'm your father, Tenchi.  I should know what happened to you!

{Knock at the door.}

Tenchi: {Relieved.} I'll get the door! {Moves toward the door.}

Nobuyuki: {Following Tenchi.} Tenchi!

Tenchi: {Opens the door to find Kiyone and Mihoshi on the other side.  
[All: AGGGHHH! NOOO!]
{Happily surprised.} Hey!

Mihoshi: {Waving.} Hi, Tenchi!

Kiyone: Hello, Tenchi.  We've come to see Washu.  Is she here?

Tenchi: No.  She, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Ryo-Ohki left for the US yesterday 
and haven't come back.

Kiyone:  Washu told us to come by today in case they didn't return.  She 
thought they may need help.

Nobuyuki: {Putting the mac on.} Why don't you come in and join us for 
dinner.

{Change to view of Sasami and Mihoshi in the kitchen.  Return to living 
room.}
[Tom: I didn't know Mihoshi could teleport!]
[Crow: She didn't. Nobuyuki mentioned food.]
[Tom: Oh yeah.]

Kiyone: {Shyly.} No, we have to find the others.

Tenchi: Can I help?

Nobuyuki: No, Tenchi, you aren't well!

Tenchi: {With nobility.} They need help.

Kiyone: {Softly.} Alright, but only if Sasami comes to look after you.

Nobuyuki: {Agreeing.} Okay, but only if you tell me what I want to know 
when you get back.  By the by, why would they go to the US?
[Mike: To smuggle in Anime tapes?]

Tenchi: I'll fill you in Dad.

{Together, Tenchi, Kiyone, and Nobuyuki head to the kitchen.}

Tenchi: You see...Washu received these Arquillian signals going to the 
island of Manhattan in the United States...

{From the kitchen they hear Mihoshi yelling and a crash.}
[Crow: Ohmygod! They killed Mihoshi!]
[Tom: You BASTARDS!]
Kiyone: {Surprised.} What was that?!

{Tenchi, Kiyone, and Nobuyuki run into the kitchen to find Sasami 
standing.  They all look at Mihoshi somehow stuck in the refrigerator.  
Cookies litter the floor.  Teardrops all around.}

Mihoshi: {In pain.} Ow...

Kiyone: {Angry.} MIHOSHI!  HOW DID YOU DO THIS?!

Mihoshi: {Sorrily whining.} I was just getting some cola for these cookies! 
{Points to cookies on the floor.} I'm sorry!
[Mike: One does not usually associate cookies with cola.]

Kiyone: {Forgivingly.} Alright.  Let's clean this up.

Tenchi: You'd better get ready to go, Sasami.  We're following the others.

Sasami: {Happy.} Hurray!  We're going to America!
[All:...TODAY!]

{Kiyone and Tenchi help Mihoshi out of the refrigerator.  They all begin to 
clean up the kitchen.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{In the ratty hotel all characters are asleep: Washu in a rotten chair, Ayeka 
on a dust covered bed, L on another,
[Crow: Another what?]
 J in another chair, Ryoko on the floor, and Ryo-Ohki on the window-sill.  
Sun shines through the window onto Ryo-Ohki who awakes.  She goes to 
Washu and meows for food.  All
conversation inside the room is quiet to prevent J and Ryoko's early rise 
from sleep.}

Washu: {Waking.} What is it, Ryo-Ohki?  I'ven't any food...{Stomach 
growls.}...but it's time. 
[Mike: IT HAS BEGUN! (MK)]
{Gets up and goes to Ayeka.} Ayeka.

Ayeka: {Waking.} Yes...

Washu: Let's get L and leave for breakfast.

Ayeka: Alright. {Gets up.}

{Washu and Ayeka move to the second bed where L sleeps.}

Ayeka & Washu: L.

L: {Waking with a start.} What?!

Ayeka & Washu: Breakfast.

[Mike: Gee, pretty demanding, aren't they?]
[Crow: Mike. Who are they?]
[Mike: Huh? ... Oh. Yeah, forgot. Sorry.]
L: Okay, but what about J and Ryoko?  If they wake, they'll fight, and I'll 
have to clean it up.

Washu: Ryo-Ohki, you can stay and watch these two.

{Ryo-Ohki meows sadly.}

Washu: There are no carrots near here.  We'll bring some food back.

{Ryo-Ohki reluctantly agrees.}

Ayeka: Let's hurry!  I'm hungry.

{Ayeka and L with Washu between exit the hotel and walk down the 
sidewalk.}

Ayeka: So, where are we to eat?

Washu: Somewhere we can get food and leave quickly.

L: Mc Donald's then.

{L, Ayeka, and Washu head for a McDonald's restaurant.}

Washu: L, why is it the MIB never attempted to capture Ryoko earlier?  
She's been on Earth for about two years.

L: From what I know, the MIB cannot take an alien from Japan.

Ayeka: Why is that?

L: The MIB learned that an organic ship landed there in the 30's.  
Supposedly, it was a Juraian ship.  Since the MIB know the Juraians are a 
generally benevolent race, they left the case unsolved.
[Tom: Next, on Unsolved Mysteries....]

Washu: That ship belonged to Yosho, Tenchi's grandfather.  We're all glad 
the MIB didn't interfere.

Ayeka: Yes, otherwise, we could not have saved Jurai.

L: This made a precedent that has held to today: the MIB do not capture 
aliens outside the US.

Ayeka: Speaking of aliens, why was that Arquillian ship in orbit?

L: Well...two days ago a bug came to Earth after the Galaxy, an Arquillian 
possession.
[Crow: Yeah, it's their best MARBLE.]
[Mike: Crow, there might be people who haven't seen the movie yet.]
[Crow: Well if they haven't, they must be stuck 50,000 ft beneath the earth, 
hogtied, 
blindfolded, with no light source and....]
[Mike: Never mind.]

Washu: Ah!  The Galaxy!  He could've destroyed Earth, so who stopped 
him?
[Tom: The Mother of all Pest Control strips.]

L: K, J, and myself.  Truthfully, do you have any connection to the bug?

Ayeka: Of course not!

Washu: We went up there to see why the Arquillian vessel was here.

{They arrive at Mc Donald's.}

L: I'll go in.

Ayeka: This is best since Sasami and I were left with the check last time. 
{Scowls at Washu.  Turns back to L.}  I'll have an orange juice and 
something without grease.

Washu: {Sarcastically aside.} Near to impossible in a fast-food restaurant.

L: A salad.  I'll take a Egg Mc Muffin and coffee. 
[Tom: Why would she tell them what she's getting? She's going in a getting it!]
[Crow: Well, she told them about everything else, why not what she's going to 
eat?]

Washu: I'll eat hash browns and coffee.

L: Okay.  J'll have the same as me.  What about Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki?

Washu: Order a second salad, heavy on carrots and a hamburger, rare.

{L enters the restaurant.}

Washu: {Thinking.} This mantis creature...Ryoko and J could not penetrate 
its defenses.

Ayeka: {Full of disdain.} HA!  As if Ryoko could defeat anyone!

Washu: {Angered.} This is no time to be arrogant, Ayeka!  This beast took 
an energy and a weapon attack!  The only thing I know that came close was Kain!

Ayeka: {Startled.} WHAT?!  We could be in for another fight like THAT?!

Washu: {Seriously.} I fear so.  I need a cellular sample to calculate an 
effective counterattack.

{L comes out of Mc Donald's with a huge bag in her hands.}

L: Here we go.  I overheard part of your conversation, and all I want is its 
purpose.

Washu: Regardless of its purpose, we need an adequate attack...

{A continual beeping comes from Washu.  All turn to question it.}

[Crow: (as Washu) What? Oh! It's mine! I thought it was one of yours!]
Ayeka: What is it?

Washu: {Pulls out a beeper.} Yagami is above us. {Creates her laptop and 
begins typing.}

Ayeka: {Surprised.} You mean Mihoshi and Kiyone are here?

Washu: Yes. {Stops typing, and image of Miho-Kiyo
[Tom: Whaaa? Is that some sort of cabbit?]
[Mike: Um, I don't think so. It doesn't end with Ohki.]
[Crow: I think it's the name of a toilet.]
on the Yagami's bridge in their respective seats comes up on the screen.} 
Kiyone!

Ayeka: {Happy.} Mihoshi!  Kiyone!

Kiyone: {Surprised.} Ayeka!  Washu!  Where are you?  How are you?

L: Who are you?

Mihoshi: We're Galaxy Police officers.

Kiyone: More important, who are you?

L: I'm a MIB agent.

Kiyone: {Thinking.} The Men In Black...I remember now.

Washu: We're outside a Mc Donald's restaurant and alright.  Ryoko, Ryo-
Ohki, and L's partner J are back at a hotel at these coordinates. {Presses a key 
on the laptop.}

Kiyone: I think we worked there once.

Mihoshi: {Giddy.} Guess what!  Tenchi and Sasami are on board with us!

Ayeka: {Angrily surprised.}  WWWHHHAAATTT!!!  Lord Tenchi and 
Sasami are HERE!

[Tom: Yeah, we know that they're here, Mihoshi just told us!]
[Mike: I think the writer just a small mistake, not that much to nitpick at.]
[Tom: It's my line, and I'll nitpick if I wanna!]
[Mike: Fine, don't blame me if your head blows up.]

Kiyone: {Startled.} Mihoshi!  I told you not to mention them!

Ayeka: {Worried.} Is Tenchi alright?  What is Sasami doing here?

Kiyone: {Apologetically.} We'll explain later.  The important fact is that 
you're...

{A light blinks on Kiyone's console.}

Mihoshi: What's that?

Kiyone: It's another ship hailing us.  A GP patrol-ship!

L: Sounds like you're busy.  Why don't we call back later.

Kiyone: Yes.  We'll meet you at that hotel.

Washu: Agreed.

{Washu logs off, and Ayeka, Washu, and L begin to return to the hotel.  
Return to Yagami.}

Kiyone: I wonder who this is.  Did you do anything, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi: No, Kiyone.

{Kiyone presses a button bringing up an image of the opposing pilot.  The 
pilot is Mitsuki, Kiyone's classmate, but she is different.  Her face is 
jaggedly scarred on the left side; her left arm is mechanical.  The scar is 
similar to Nagi's war-paint, and because of this scar, her mutton-chops are 
missing.}

Kiyone: {Surprised.} Mitsuki?

Mitsuki: Hello, Kiyone.  You seem well.

Kiyone: {Thoroughly surprised.} I thought everyone at headquarters was 
killed except for Operative A.  How did you get out?

Mitsuki: {Surprised.} A got out?  Where is my love???

Kiyone: It's in my report.

Mitsuki: {Enraged.} I didn't read the report!  Tell me!  Where is A?

Kiyone: {Solemn.}   I can't tell you.  Not this.

Mitsuki: {Frustrated.}   Fine!  This is how the first in class escaped Kain.

[Crow: Let me take you there now through the magic of television!]

{Flashback to TMIL.  Within GPHQ Mitsuki is sitting at her desk typing a 
report in her office. Mitsuki begins a voice-over.}

Mitsuki: I was sitting at my desk preparing a report when alarm bells went 
off everywhere.

{Alarms go off.}

Mitsuki: I ran into the corridor to find that the entire station was in chaos.  
People running away from what seemed to be a energy wave.

{Mitsuki runs out into the hall to see the temporal wave coming at a 
distance.  People run about in chaos, 
[Tom: As stated previously.] 
most being enveloped by the wave.}
[Mike: And then sent to Abu Dhabi.]
Mitsuki: Having no other choice, I ran towards the nearest docking port.

{She runs down the hall to the closest ship.}

Mitsuki: I couldn't save anyone else, and my love was nowhere to be found.  
When I arrived at a ship, others attempted to escape but their crafts were 
destroyed.  I was about to enter the ship when a bulkhead gave under the 
internal strain.

{The wall on Mitsuki's left gives way to an explosion on the other side. White 
screen. End flashback.}

Mitsuki: {Regretfully.} I got in the ship and scarcely escaped with my life.  I 
lost my face and my arm to Kain.

Kiyone: {Amazed.} My God!

Mitsuki: Now, I'm here to pick up Ryoko for all her old crimes.  You two 
know where she is so speak up.

Mihoshi: {Oblivious.} Well, she's...

{Kiyone covers Mihoshi's mouth.}

[Crow: (as Mihoshi) ...Mpph, mpppph,mumble, mpha, ahhhmph, mphhh, 
mppph....(Keeps doing this)]

Kiyone: We know where Princess Ayeka is.

Mitsuki: {Disappointed.} Okay.  I know you are loyal to this criminal so I'll 
let you go for now. Just stay out of my way.  By the by, I am the liaison 
officer to the MIB.  See you around, salutatorian.

{Transmission ends.  Kiyone lets Mihoshi go.}
[Crow: (stops mpphing) ...and that's where she is!]

Mihoshi: What will she do, Kiyone?

Kiyone: I doubt even she knows.  Let's land and get to the others quickly.

{Yagami and Mitsuki's ship land: Yagami near the hotel, Mitsuki's near MIBHQ.}

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{At the ratty hotel Ayeka, Washu, and L walk to the door to their room.  
Soon afterward, Kiyone walks up to them.}

Ayeka: Kiyone!

Washu: You missed the party.  We have a powerful new foe.

L: Sounds like ya been through this before.

Kiyone: {Quietly.} Too many times before.

Washu: {Seriously.} The hard data is it is big, ugly, and energy-resistant 
mantis.

Kiyone: I've never heard of a race like that.  Could it have been created?

Washu: Probably.

Ayeka: Who would want such a creature?

[Tom: I would! It would go great with my bug collection! Right next to the 
monarch butterfly!]
L: Someone wanting a perfect soldier?

Washu: Insects make the best soldiers, and the bugs aren't as powerful as 
before.

L: {Worried.} Let's get inside.

Kiyone: {Agreeing.} Yeah, people hear too much.

{L unlocks the door.  Upon the opening of the door, Ryoko and J awake, 
see each other, and remember where they left off.}

J: {Grabbing his gun.} Wasup?

Ryoko: {Powering up.} Your head in a moment!

{Ryo-Ohki and Washu grab Ryoko; L, dropping the food, and Kiyone grab 
J.}

Ayeka: {Laughing.} HAHAHAHA!!!!  This is better than fighting her 
myself.
[Mike: Yeah, it's fun having a chance to see your rival's head get blown off 
without doing it yourself!]

{A gentle wind blows from behind Ayeka.}

Ayeka: {Startled.} Huh? {Turns to the green mantis creature standing 
behind her.} AAAHHH!!!

{The others turn facing the insect.}

Mantis: Princess Ayeka.  Call me Illirg.  As another alien you should 
understand my motives.

L: What do you mean?

Illirg: {Angered by L.} Be silent, woman!  Primitive human!  You and all 
you have infected shall be annihilated!
[Crow: Ummmmm....]
[Mike: No, Crow.]
[Crow: Fine. Even I really didn't want to touch that one.]
Ayeka: {Angering.  Creates her cylinders.} Madman!

Ryoko: {Energy flowing in her hands.} Maniac!

Kiyone: {Aiming her service blaster.} Fool!

L: {Aiming a de-atomizer.} Lunatic!

J: {Aiming a pulse gun.} Crazy-ass!

[Mike: Numb-nuts!]
[Tom: Dickweed!]
[Crow: Ass-munch!]
[Mike: Butthead...er..butt....spank]
[Bots: (Laugh like Bevis and Butthead)]
Illirg: {Surprised.} You are all diseased!  Oh well...{His covering turns to 
red and black patterns.  Brings up his forelimbs in a triangle formation and 
summons red energy into the gap between them.}...You all will die. 
[Crow: (Resident Evil 2) EVERYONE'S GOING TO DIE!!!]
{Fires a blast at the characters.}

{As the fireball hits, all characters scatter.  Ryoko flies up.  Ayeka jumps 
backwards, L and J to either side.  Kiyone slides between its legs to the other 
side of him.  Ryo-Ohki and Washu bail out the window and head toward Yagami. 
[Mike: It's the annual MiB/Tenchi Muyo olympics! Next up: gymnastics!]
Ayeka gives Illirg a full force shock.  No effect.}

Illirg: {Laughing.} Princess, really? {Aims at Ayeka.}

{Ryoko fires a max force blast onto its head.}

Illirg: {Blinded.} Ryoko!  You fool! {Grabs its eyes with weapon arms.}

{Ryoko lands next to Ayeka.}

Illirg: {Sees Ryoko and Ayeka.} 
[Crow: Thank God for corrective lenses!]
DAMN YOU BOTH! {Fires on them.}
Ryoko & Ayeka: AAAHHH!!! {Put up their shields.}
[Tom: (as Kirk) Arm photon torpedos, charge phaser banks!]
{The blast reacts with the combination of the Jurai Power and Ryoko's 
powers.  Illirg's attack AND his shields are nullified.}

Kiyone: J!  L!  FFFIIIRRREEE!!!

{Together J, L, and Kiyone assault the beast wounding its abdomen.}

Illirg: RRRAAAHHH!!!
[All: Rah! Sish! Boom! Bah! Illirg! Illirg! Rah! Rah! Rah!]
{His face turns white.  Raises his arms summoning energy and drops them 
releasing all that energy in one vertical explosion encompassing his entire 
body.}

{This explosion thrusts Kiyone, J, and L backward.}

J: {Frustrated.} We can't take this guy!

L: Kiyone, what about Yagami's weapon systems?

Kiyone: Good plan.

{Kiyone, J, and L run to Yagami.}

Illirg: {His shields return.  His coloring returns to the red and black 
patterns.  
Laughing.} Now, only you two powerhouses remain! {Aims the triangle at them.} 
Prepared for death?

Ryoko: Not today! {Begins rapid-fire blasts on Illirg.  No effect.}

{Illirg charges and fires at Ayeka and Ryoko.  They dodge, but Ayeka gets 
most of the brunt in her right shoulder.}  

Ayeka: {Falling down. Slow-motion.} 
A...A...A...h...h...h...!...!...!......{Real-time.  Hits ground unconscious.}

Voice: AAAYYYEEEKKKAAA!!!
[Mike: And Tarzan appears!]
{Tenchi falls at high velocity with a Tenchiken blade aimed at the beast's 
neck.  He glints off the creature's shields.  Tenchi lands between Ayeka and 
Ryoko.  He stands daringly protecting Ayeka.}
[Tom: Strike a pose.]
Ryoko: {Startled.} Tenchi?!

{Yagami pulls over.  Ryoko teleports up with Tenchi and Ayeka into the 
cargo bay.  Yagami fires
its weapons onto the Illirg.  The weapons rebound and decimate the 
remaining walls of the hotel room.}

Illirg: {Further enraged.} No matter where you go, I WILL DESTROY 
YOU ALL!!!  I WILL CLEANSE THE UNIVERSE OF THE EARTH.  
[Crow:(As Illirg)With my giant vaccum cleaner!]
[Tom: Then we will turn it from suck to blow!]
{Fires at Yagami taking out an engine.}

{Yagami falls toward the MIBHQ.  In the cargo bay crash alarms sound.  
Washu activates a medical bed.  Tenchi places Ayeka on the bed.  Sasami comes 
over.  Tenchi and Sasami seem to mourn her. Ryoko stands aside watching this 
disillusioned.}

Washu: {Walks over to Ayeka and sees some ooze on her shoe.} What's 
this? {Pulls out a medical spatula and scrapes some off.  Quietly.}
[Tom: They have medical spatulas?]
[Crow: Well, if the patiant dies, you can grill 'em up!]
[Mike: That's pretty sick, Crow.]
[Crow: Bite me, Nelson.]  
Its blood...Ah!  This is the key!

{On the bridge Miho-Kiyo sit in their respective seats.  J and L stand 
behind them.}

L: We're heading for headquarters.

Kiyone: We need somewhere safe to land away from that creature.

J: Zed's not gonna like Ryoko comin' back.

[Tom: Yeah, she didn't pay the security deposit last time.]

L: We must warn them about Illirg.

Mihoshi: {Hysterical.} BUT I DON'T WANT TO CRASH!!!

Kiyone, J, & L: SHUT UP, MIHOSHI!

{Yagami falls next to MIBHQ, right on top of Mitsuki's ship.}

End Scene 3

End Act 4

Act 5

Scene 1

{A silent screen image of Illirg in the motel appears.  From off-screen laser 
weapons fire and rebound off of the beast's shields.  Zoom out to see the screen 
in Zed's office where Zed sits behind his desk with J and Kiyone across from 
him.}

Zed: So, nothing on Yagami could touch this new bug, eh?

J: Right.

Kiyone: Mihoshi and I fired every possible weapon onto that being.  None 
of it penetrated.

Zed: I've also been getting reports from other agents about Illirg.  Maybe 
something has changed after your attack. {Turns to a com screen and activates 
it.  An image of another MIB agent comes into focus standing before a war-zone 
littered with bodies.} R, what's the status on Illirg?

R: {Panicked.} Boss, this thing is rampaging through town!  Various super-
heroes have come out to fight, but they're all losing!
[Tom: Superheros!?!?! (Head starts smoking)]
[Mike: Oh NO! I'll be right back! Hold on Tom! (Leaves, running)]

J: {Irritated.} Chill!  Who's come out?

R: The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Avengers, all defeated!  
Wait, Spiderman just arrived! {Points behind him.}
[Tom: But...title...MiB/Tenchi...but...multicrossover....not...right...]

{Camera moves to Spiderman swinging down from a building towards 
Illirg.
[Tom: SPIDERMAN?!?!?! (Tom's head explodes) KABOOM!]
[Mike runs back in with a coolent smoothee]
[Crow: Too late, Nelson!]
[Mike: Crud. *sigh* Well, I guess I'll to clean it up after the fic. (Sits 
down)]
Illirg's colorings change to resemble Kain's appearance.  He lifts a claw 
towards Spidey, and a temporal sphere appears.  Spidey swings right into it.  
The sphere collapses. [Crow: Duhhhhh...let's swing right into the sphere! Yep, 
that how'll stop him. Yep, yep!]
 Illirg's covering returns to green.  Camera returns to R.}

R: Zed, please send someone to help!

{Transmission ends.}

Kiyone: {Appalled.} That energy...!

Voice: Was like Kain's energy.

{Zed, J, and Kiyone turn to see Mitsuki standing in the doorway.}

Zed: {Surprised.} Mitsuki?  You've seen that before?

Mitsuki: {Angered.} Yes.  That's what destroyed the GP headquarters.

Kiyone: {Confused.} But, how can that be Kain's energy?  My friends and 
I destroyed him in subspace.

Mitsuki: I don't know, but I soon will. {Exits through door.  From the hall.} 
Hey, Kiyone!  You owe me for my ship!

{Kiyone sighs.}
[Crow and Mike: Wahhh,wahhh, wahhhhh, WAHHHHHH! (Like the music when something 
bad happens in a goofy movie)]

Zed: {Questioningly.} Your friends?  Who would these people be?

Kiyone: I told you, Zed.  Anyone on Yagami is in my jurisdiction.  Just 
mind your own business. {Stands and walks to the door.  Turns to Zed.}  Besides, 
I know from experience that we'll need Ryoko against Illirg. {Exits.  Walks down 
the hall to a medical area.  Enters Ayeka's room.}

{Here, Ayeka lies on a comfortable bed with L hovering over her taking 
medical measurements. Tenchi and Sasami are asleep in the two chairs further 
back in the room.  Ryo-Ohki sleeps on Sasami's lap.  Mihoshi sleeps on the floor 
between the chairs.}
[Tom: (head regrown) Proof once again that Mihoshi can sleep anywhere, anytime.]
[Mike: Hey Tom, you gonna be all right?]
[Tom: Yeah, as long as they don't mention any more superheros NOT mentioned in 
the title.]
[Mike: By the way, you're cleaning yourself up.]
Kiyone: L, how is Ayeka doing?

L: {Ends her tests.  Tired.} She's stable now.  Whew, trying to treat a 
Juraian is hard.  They're bodies are so fickle,
[Mike: Yeah, they're all a bunch a wusses!]
but she'll be up by tomorrow.

Kiyone: {Looking to the others.} And them?

L: Oh, they've been here all night.  Tenchi was quite insistent not to leave, 
even when I demanded.  Are they married?

Kiyone: No, but there's been talk of someone marrying him, one day.

L: By the way, Washu constructed a temporary path to her lab through the 
bathroom door.  She wants to see you.

{Kiyone goes through the bathroom door to appear in Washu's lab.  In the 
lab Washu sits over her instruments with Ryoko behind her.}

Kiyone: Washu, have you discovered anything?

Washu: Unfortunately, yes.  Illirg is, as we feared, a product of genetic 
engineering.  It is a blend of Ryoko's, Kain's, Kagato's, and bug DNA. 

[Tom: Hey, isn't that from...]
[Mike: Yep! Halfway into the fic, and we get to the first main plot point.]

Kiyone: That explains its power.

Ryoko: And how it always finds us.

Kiyone: What?

Washu: It's true.  It has Ryoko's DNA so it also has her telepathic abilities.  
Anytime Ryoko or Ryo-Ohki use their powers, it can home on their energy output.

Ryoko: {Angered.} Damn!  I can't do anything without bringing that 
monster on us.
[Crow: I guess it's good that Ayeka is unconscious, then!]

Washu: It gets worse, Kiyone.  I found a compound in this sample that 
enhances genetic advantage. Luckily, some of the DNA is contradictory.

Ryoko & Kiyone: {Dumbfounded.} What?

Washu: {Angering.} It MEANS the genes are IMPROVED AND 
STRENGTHENED, YET some genes CANCEL OUT!

Kiyone: Like Kain's coupled with Kagato's.

Ryoko: How's Tenchi?

Kiyone: He's asleep.  Ayeka seems to be recovering and will be back 
tomorrow.

Washu: That's good since we need her.  If you remember, Ryoko and 
Ayeka were able to cancel Illirg's energy for a short time.  It may be possible 
if they both attack Illirg to keep his shields down for Tenchi, J, and yourself 
to destroy it.

Ryoko: Sounds like a plan.

Kiyone: Our weapons did wound it after its shields were down.  Tenchi 
would definitely add more damage!
[Crow: Oh, Tenchi's a little puss!]
[Mike: Quiet! You'll anger Tenchi character fans and bring their wrath on us!]
[Tom: Is there any Tenchi fans?]
[Mike: Umm.....never mind.]

Washu: Yes, but I won't count on just those weapons. {An insane smile 
appears on her lips.}  I'm developing something better.

[All: AAAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!]

Kiyone: I'm sure.  What would happen if it used the powers of Kain and 
Kagato together?

Washu: {Thinking.} That could destroy him!  We can try it.

Kiyone: While you work that out, I'll check on my ship.

{Kiyone exits the lab and Ayeka's room and walks down the crowded halls 
of MIBHQ.  She enters a
door and arrives at a docking bay.  Within Yagami and Mitsuki's ship are 
held by braces
[Mike: (as ship) But I don't wanna get braces! They'll make me look dorky!] 
being repaired by MIB workers.  Kiyone walks in and heads for one of the 
technicians.}

Kiyone: How's my ship?

Technician: From all the dints and dings, it's been through a lot.

Kiyone: Yes.

Technician: Other than paneling, Yagami is ready to fly.

Kiyone: Thanks. {Gasps and falls down in pain.}

{The technician turns to see Mitsuki scowling at Kiyone with her 
mechanical hand in a fist where
Kiyone's neck was.}

Mitsuki: {Crying in uncontrollable rage.} YOU BITCH!!!

{The technician runs to get help.  Kiyone rolls away to her feet to face 
Mitsuki.}

Mitsuki: I'LL KILL YOU!!!
[Tom: (Makes cat hissing sounds)]
Kiyone: What?

Mitsuki: You left A to DIE!!! {Charges at Kiyone.}

{Kiyone grabs Mitsuki, rolls backward, and throws her, but Mitsuki 
corkscrews through the air to land on her feet.}

Kiyone: We didn't!  Stop this before someone gets hurt!

Mitsuki: NO! {Pulls out her weapon and fires on Kiyone.}

{Kiyone dives behind Mitsuki's ship so Mitsuki's shots hit only her own 
ship.}

Mitsuki: You're a Galaxy Police officer!  Why did you save that Juraian 
wench and not your colleague?

Kiyone: Listen to yourself!  You don't even sound like an officer anymore!

Mitsuki: SHUT UP! {Fires again.}
[Crow: I AM ABOVE THE LAW!]
{Kiyone runs out and employs her whip.  She throws it around Mitsuki 
catching her.}

Mitsuki: {Shakes and sheds tears frantically.} You should all DIE!!!  Why 
didn't you save him???  You and your friends have ruined my life!  I'll kill 
Illirg then kill YOU AND TENCHI for letting A DIE!!!

{J and other MIB agents rush in and place Mitsuki in cuffs, and the other 
agents take her off screaming.  Kiyone puts away her whip.}

J: Who started this?

Kiyone: She attacked me from behind.

[Mike: Now, that's no reason for a fight young lady! Why didn't you tell the 
teacher? We would have made her apologize, and turn our backs to you and assume 
everything would be fine!]

J: What could've pissed her off?

Kiyone: She read my report on the Kain case.  Her lover died.

J: Oh.  Do you remember how Illirg blew up at L?

Kiyone: Yes.  Why?

J: It reminded me of something K said about that. {Thinking.} Now what 
was it?

{Flashback to MIB.  J and K are in a room full of confiscated and 
duplicated items.  J pays little attention.}

K: Oh, that is a lot of fun.  It's a universal translator. {Picks up a tuning 
fork-shaped item.} We're not even supposed to have it, and I'll tell you why.  
Human thought is so primitive that it's looked upon as a infectious disease in 
some of the better galaxies.

{End Flashback.}
[Tom: Sorry, it was pay-per-view. We could only see the first five minutes.]
J: That's right!  He said that many groups hate Earth.  Is this true?

Kiyone: Not in this galaxy.  I've never had a case of racism like this except 
for Kain's attempted genocide of the Royal House of Jurai.

J: You spoke to Washu.  What does she think?

Kiyone: That we're in big trouble.

{Kiyone and J walk out into a corridor.}

End Scene 1

Scene 2

{In Ayeka's room all is as Kiyone left save that L has been sent elsewhere.}

Tenchi: {Waking up.} What a night.  {Looks around and sights Ayeka.} 
Ayeka. {Gets up and walks to her.} Maybe, if I came with you to begin with, you 
wouldn't be lying here hurt.

Voice: {Waking up.} Ttteeennnccchhhiii...

Tenchi: {Surprised.} Ayeka? {Looks around and sees Sasami waking up.}

Sasami: Good morning, Tenchi.  How's Ayeka?

Tenchi: Nothing new, Sasami. 
[Mike: Except she woke up.]

Sasami: Oh.  Is there anything we can do?

Tenchi: Look after her, I expect, but I think L will do most of that.

Sasami: {Perking up.}  Maybe I could make some lunch.

Tenchi: Alright.  You could ask Washu about some pots.

Sasami: Okay! {Begins to get up and disturbs Ryo-Ohki.}

{Ryo-Ohki awakes.}

Sasami: Ryo-Ohki, are you hungry?

{Ryo-Ohki acknowledges.}

Sasami: {Happy.} Then come on!  Let's cook something good!

{Ryo-Ohki hops onto Sasami's head, and they enter the bathroom door to 
Washu's lab.}

Voice: {Waking up.} Cook???
[Tom: Who the heck is saying that?]
[Mike: Oh, it's just "Voice" again.]

{Tenchi turns around to see Mihoshi get up and sleepily follow Sasami into 
Washu's lab.}

Tenchi: {Not surprised.} Never mention food around Mihoshi.

{Knock at the door.  Tenchi goes to open the door to find J and Kiyone on 
the other side.}

Kiyone: Hello, Tenchi.  How's Ayeka?

Tenchi: No change.

J: Where's Washu at?

Tenchi: {Yawns.} She hasn't left her lab since last night.

Kiyone: Thank you, Tenchi.

{Tenchi moves his chair next to Ayeka's bed and sits down.  Kiyone and J 
enter the bathroom door and appear in Washu's lab.  Here, Washu types on her 
laptop operating small robots building a large machine.}
[Mike: I always wondered why so many women use the the bathroom at one time. Now 
I know.]

J: Hey, Washu!  Whatcha doin'?

Washu: Building you two a weapon, the Lyex.
[Crow: That peice of crap?! The Game Boy is far superior!]
[Mike: No, not Lynx, LYEX.]
[Crow: Ooops. Sorry.]
Kiyone: It looks powerful.

Washu: {Stomach growls.} Well, time to stop for lunch. {Points to a 
dimensional door standing to Kiyone and J's right.} Sasami's cooking through 
there.  J, could you get L?

J: Alright. {Exits through the door to Ayeka's room.}

{Washu logs off the laptop.  Kiyone and Washu walk together toward the 
door to the kitchen.}

Kiyone: Do you know what Sasami is cooking?

Washu: No.

{Kiyone opens the door to see Ryoko come through.}

Ryoko: Thanks, but I'll get something besides carrots.

Kiyone & Washu: OH NO!

{Kiyone and Washu enter the kitchen slowly.  Ryoko continues to the door 
to Ayeka's room.
Upon opening she sees Tenchi asleep, his head on his hands which are over 
Ayeka's hand.}
[All:Oh,oh!]
Ryoko: {Closing the door a bit.} Tenchi... {Enters the room and hurries 
through into the MIB corridor.}

{J comes down the hall and sees Ryoko.}

J: Ryoko!

{L comes down the hall.}

L: Hi, J.

J: {Hurriedly.} L, Sasami made lunch. {Follows Ryoko.}

L: {Confused.} Thanks, I guess.

{Ryoko continues to hurry to the motor-pool.  In the motor-pool.}

J: Ryoko!  Stop!

Ryoko: {Stops and turns to J.  Tears in her eyes.} What the hell do you 
want?!

J: Where do ya think you're going?

Ryoko: Out.

J: You can't leave.

Ryoko: {Angered.} The only thing keeping me from killing you is that 
damn beast on the streets! You know that, don't you?  You're too much like Nagi, 
always interfering.

J: {Surprised.} What's the matter with you?  I'd heard you were a ruthless 
space pirate, and now you're crying over nothing.

Ryoko: {Enraged.} HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?  WHO HAVE YOU 
EVER LOVED?  The man I nearly gave my LIFE for is at the bedside of another 
woman!

J: Where you goin' to go?

Ryoko: I'm going to Illirg and get back something that belongs to me!

J: What?

Ryoko: The blood I shed on Jurai!  This beast was made from pieces of me, 
a bug, and two villains that Tenchi and Achika destroyed.  Also, one of them 
nearly killed me!  I never got a chance at payback against Kagato.  This is my 
chance for REVENGE!

J: Ryoko, you can't kill it.  We all tried to kill it and nothing happened.  
You'll die!

Ryoko: {Losing control.} I don't care! {The old pain in her left side 
returns.}

J: {Seeing her weakness.} Ryoko...!

Ryoko: {Her eyes dry up.} I'm going to kill Illirg.  It isn't right for someone 
to take my genetic information without my permission.

J: Can I join you?

Ryoko: If you want.  You may've wanted to wait until Washu finished the 
mech.  Oh well, just don't try to arrest me otherwise I will kill you.

J: Okay.

{J and Ryoko go to J's car and drive off.  From behind another car, Mitsuki 
stands up.}

Mitsuki: Ryoko, I'm going to kill Illirg not you!  If that thing has Kain's 
DNA, I will be the one to erase his existence.  I just need this mech...

{Mitsuki runs into the corridor and disappears.}

[Tom: WILL Mitsuki steal the mech? WILL J and Ryoko defeat Illirg? WILL Tenci 
stop being such a little puss? Join us next time for Scene #3!]

End Scene 2

Scene 3

{In Ayeka's room nothing has changed.}

Tenchi: {Waking up.} Hmm.  Ayeka.

Ayeka: {Starting to revive.} Ttteeennnccchhhiii...

Tenchi: {Startled.} AYEKA!

Ayeka: {Her eyes open slowly.} Lord Tenchi...

Tenchi: {Happy.} Ayeka, you're alright!

Ayeka: {Sitting up.} What has happened? {Has pain in her right shoulder} 
Ow...

Tenchi: {Grabbing her.} Ayeka!  Please don't move.  You've been 
unconscious for almost a day. {Lays her back down.}
[Crow: I've been unconscious for most of this fic.]
Ayeka: Where is Sasami?  Are you alright, Lord Tenchi?

Tenchi: {Kindly.} You still need to rest.  Looks like our positions are 
reversed now.

{The door is broken down.  Mitsuki runs in with weapon drawn.  She sees 
Tenchi and Ayeka and aims her weapon at them.}

Mitsuki: Lord Tenchi Masaki and Princess Ayeka of Jurai!  I'll deal with 
you two later!

Tenchi: {Standing toward Mitsuki.} Mitsuki, what's wrong?

Mitsuki: Shut up, you half breed! 
[Mike: (as Tenchi) Actually, I'm not a half breed, I'm a quarter...]

{Fires a warning shot near his head.}

[Mike: (continuing)...but I could tell you about that later.]
I told you you'll pay for your crime later!  Now, where is Washu?

{The bathroom door opens and Kiyone begins to step through.  Mitsuki 
fires at the door.}

Kiyone: Whoa!

Mitsuki: Damn!  There are too many people here! {Charges the door 
breaking it down and knocking Kiyone to the side.}

{Inside, Washu, Mihoshi, Sasami, and L stand formerly walking to the door 
staring at Mitsuki. Ryo-Ohki is on the floor hissing at Mitsuki.}

Sasami & Mihoshi: {Scared.} AAAHHH!!!

L: {Surprised.} Mitsuki?

Mitsuki: {Grabbing Washu like a classic hostage.} STAY BACK!  Washu, 
where's this big mech of  yours?

Washu: {Creates her laptop and begins typing.  Calmly.} Right here. {Stops 
typing, and a set of lights activate reveling a 10 meter tall robot.} The Lyex.

[All: (Starts humming 2001 theme)]
Mitsuki: Now is the time for MY REVENGE! {Throws down Washu.  
Places her left palm toward the ground where upon a rocket fires allowing her to 
fly up to the pilot's chair.}

Kiyone: {Runs to Washu's side.} Washu!  Why are you letting Mitsuki steal 
this machine?

Washu: {Sits up.} I need someone to test it in combat.  Mitsuki is sure to 
do that.

{The robot comes online and begins to move.  Washu presses a key and a 
dimensional door opens
above the robot.  Mitsuki flies the machine up through the hole.  Washu 
stands and logs off.}

Sasami: What're we going to do now?

Mihoshi: {Scared still.} Hide?

Washu: No!

L: Ryoko's outside looking for Illirg now.

Sasami: How do you know that?

L: I saw J and Ryoko running through the hall.  I assumed since they 
haven't destroyed the building...

Kiyone: But, Illirg could destroy them both!

Voice: They won't be alone.

{All characters turn to see Tenchi holding the Tenchiken hilt in his hand.}

[Crow: Yeah! Let's all be destroyed!]

Tenchi: Ryoko's done so much for us.  Now, we save her.  Sasami, Ayeka's 
awake.  Please take care of her.  Ryo-Ohki!

{Ryo-Ohki meows and runs past Tenchi and transforms into the ship Ryo-
Ohki destroying the roof.  She transports Tenchi onboard.  Ryo-Ohki flies away 
at top speed.}

{Wipe to J's car rolling down the road.  It stops just outside town where 
Ryoko and J get out and prepare for battle.  J takes of his jacket and pulls out 
his big gun.  Ryoko activates her battle suit.  Ryoko then fires a blast of 
energy up into the air like a flare.}
[Tom:...hitting a jet, making it go down in flames.]

J: You ready?

Ryoko: Yes.

{Before them Illirg appears.}

Illirg: {Laughing.} Ryoko.  Sacrificing yourself for your friends.  If I recall 
you did this once before and nearly got yourself killed.  Oh, but I'm sure you 
know that.

Ryoko: {Aims her palms at Illirg.} Yes, I do.

J: {Aims his weapon.} Illirg, between the two of us, don't piss her off.

Illirg: You haven't seen her mad yet.

Ryoko: Shut up and fight! {Fires at his face.  No effect.}

{Illirg power changes to Kagato and fires with Dark Jurai Energy.  Ryoko 
flies up around to Illirg's back.  J fires from the side with no effect.  Ryoko 
forms her energy sword and swipes at Illirg's abdomen to no avail.  Illirg power 
changes to Ryoko and teleports over J.  J jumps to
the side as Illirg falls where he was.  Ryoko flies between Illirg's legs 
swiping at them.  No effect. 
[Mike: Scene filmed in confus-o-vision]
 Above them rockets can be seen burning.  The Lyex robot lands just outside the 
battle zone.}

Mitsuki: {Over the built in PA system.} Illirg, or should I say Kain!  You 
owe me.

{Fighting stops and all characters look at Mitsuki.}

Illirg: {Laughing.} Oh, man!  This gets better! {Power change to Kagato.  
Creates an evil energy sword.} Come get some.

{Ryoko and J back off and allow Mitsuki to come forward and begin her 
attack.  Illirg slices off the laser arm.  The Lyex fires the machine guns on 
the left arm only to have them reflect and nail it in the left side of the 
robot's abdomen, damaging the power cell.  It tries to grab the
beasts neck.  Illirg power changes to Kain.  His thorax opens into a 
dimensional gate.  The robot's arm is enveloped.  The gate closes leaving the 
mech disarmed.}

[All: Ohmygod! You killed Lyex!]

Mitsuki: {Frantic.} YOU BASTARD!!!

Illirg: {Power changes to Ryoko.} Oh well.  Time to die, officer. {Legs fold 
up into his abdomen.
Jets fire under his leg joints.  Begins to hover.  A red glow appears on 
his right claw.}

Ryoko: {Flies up underneath Illirg firing rapid blasts onto its abdomen.  
Enraged.} DIE!

{Illirg is wounded by the surprise attack but quickly retaliates with a blast of 
Ryoko's own energy.  She blocks.  J fires blowing Illirg's left arm off.}

Illirg: {In pain.} RRRAAAHHH!!! {Power change to Kagato.  Fires on J 
with Dark Jurai Energy.}

{J dodges but one blast heads right for his head.}

Voice: NOT AGAIN!!!

[Tom: Hello "Voice"!]

{Tenchi in battle suit runs up and blocks the attack with his blade.  Tenchi 
wears a headset from Washu.}

Washu: {Over the headset.} Tenchi, to knock out the telepathic powers of 
Illirg, destroy the antennae!

Tenchi: Got it.

Ryoko: {Flies down beside Tenchi.} Tenchi...

Tenchi: J.  Ryoko.  We have to destroy its antennae.  Then, it can't track you 
or Ryo-Ohki.

Ryoko: Okay!

J: Alright!
[Mike: Rodger!]
[Crow: 10-4!]

Tenchi: {In Ryoko's ear pointing up.} Ryo-Ohki.

Ryoko: Ah...RYO-OHKI!!!

{Ryo-Ohki meows and flies over from behind Illirg.  She fires a shot onto 
the unknowledgeable Illirg.  His antennae are destroyed.  Ryoko teleports onto 
Ryo-Ohki with Tenchi and J.  The Lyex falls onto its back from lack of energy.}

Mitsuki: {Raving madly.} DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT!!!

Illirg: {Enraged.} EAT THIS!!! {Grabs Ryo-Ohki and throws her into the 
Lyex.}

{Onboard Ryo-Ohki Ryo-Ohki screams.  All characters onboard brace 
themselves.  Upon impact all characters are transported out as Ryo-Ohki becomes 
the cabbit of that name. 
[Crow: Who else? Ryo-Ohki of Jersey?]
The Lyex is in ruins, and Mitsuki is unconscious in the remains of the cockpit.}

Ryoko: {Stands bruised.} Time to go. {Uses the remainder of her energy to 
teleport all characters and the ruins of the Lyex back to MIBHQ.  Faints upon 
arrival.}

{Back outside town.}

Illirg: {Losing all control.} I'LL KILL YOU, RYOKO! {Blasts everything 
in a 10 meter radius.}

{Battle suits are gone.  In MIBHQ Ryoko and Mitsuki are wheeled to the 
medical room followed by Tenchi with Ryo-Ohki on his shoulder and J running 
behind.  Within L looks over all.  Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki remain with Ryoko, and J 
enters Washu's lab.  In Washu's lab Washu, Kiyone, Mihoshi, Ayeka, and Sasami 
watch the screens.}

Kiyone: J?

{All characters turn to J.}

J: Ryoko and Mitsuki are hurt, but Illirg can't track us anymore.

Mihoshi: Yeah!

Sasami: Is Ryoko going to be alright?

J: I think so.

Ayeka: How is Lord Tenchi?

J: Bruised, but alright.

Washu: How's my Lyex?

J: Well...
[Mike: Heh,heh...well...it..was...shreaded like a rag doll.]
Washu: {Figuring it out.  Teardrop.} Run into the ground.  Aaahhh!!!  
I'll've to fix it!

[Tom: I see puppets coming!]

Puppet Washu A: {Pops up on Washu's right shoulder.} Come on, Washu!

Puppet Washu B: {Pops up on Washu's left shoulder.} You can do it, 
Washu!

Puppet Washus A&B: Washu!  Washu!  Washu!

[Crow: Good call, Servo!]

Washu: {Perking up.} I guess I could...IMPROVE IT!!!  HAHAHAHA!!!!

{Teardrops on everyone else.  Iris out on Washu.}

[Mike and bots sing "It's the end of the world as we know it..." as they exit 
the theatre.]
