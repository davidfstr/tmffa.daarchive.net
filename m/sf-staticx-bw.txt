Songfic of Static-X's "Black and White" – "Sakuya"

by rpb3000 (rpb3000@mad.scientist.com). Disclaimer: Please don't sue,
because I am

why I
made this…

Confused in her own mind
Confused in her own mind
Confused in her
Confused in her own mind
Confused in her own mind
Confused in her
Is this real love
Is this just lust
She can't find
Is this real love
Is this just lust
She wonders why

She's a shadow
She's a shadow
She's not really human
Yugi's in control
She's Sakuya

She does not know
She does not know
She does not know why
She cannot feel
She cannot feel
She would rather die
Tenchi looks at
Tenchi looks at
Tenchi looks at her
She looks back
She looks back
She looks back at him

She's a shadow
She's a shadow
She's not really human
Yugi's in control
She's Sakuya
Tenchi is lost
Tenchi is lost
Yugi has beaten
The end is nearing
She's Sakuya
