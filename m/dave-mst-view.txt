Somewhere out in the vast depths of space, a young man tries to grasp the
concept of his reality.  He asks "Who am I", as if to realize his true
place in the shifting universe.  He knows not of his past, or what could
become of his future, all he knows is that his computer just froze and
lost all his manuscript.

A scream of primordial rage erupted through the walls of stone like the
shriek of a banshee.  This caused anyone within a vicinity of 100 yds to
completely not care, for they were used to this kind of rant.

"Every goddamn day it crashes!!!" hollered the youth.  His face a bright
red, looking not unlike an over-ripe tomato (toh-meh-toh, you English
fools) about ready to burst.  And burst he did.  Not in a messy way as
many would expect, but into a rash of vulgarities that would not be
appropriate to print here.  After what seemed to be a whole 3 minutes and
23 seconds of rant n' rave, the lad decided to calm down.  Not that
anyone cared, it seemed everyone was destined to hate him, at least he
thought so.  Truth was his personality was so reprehensible and blah blah
blah...
Note: The Authors soliloquy is brought to an immediate halt by another
male of about the same age who promptly slaps him about the head.

<Ryoko> I'll bet they'll be PLENTY of legal action over this piece of
crap
<Dave> Preach it!!

[The rooftop scene in OAV episode 1 has caused a lot of confusion over
the years. Why exactly did Ryoko attack Tenchi?

<Ryoko> It was....BECAUSE OF LOVE!!!
<Hawk> Its ok, you're not on trial here
<Dave> She isnt?
<Vegeta> Fools

When the question was raised on the ryokoforever mailing list a couple of
years ago, it
became clear that in all the arguing, no-one was considering how the
events appeared from Ryoko's own perspective,

<Ryoko> (Impersonating Isaac Hayes) Yer damn right
<Everyone else> Whoa...

so of course no-one understood why she did what she did. So I wrote this
second-person
account. While this is only one of several possible interpretations, I
think it works, altough a few of its ideas don't seem quite right in
light of new knowledge.

<Dave> Oh goodie, now Ryoko is subject to "Star Trek-geek"-like
speculation
<Hawk> (Impersonating fan) So, how could you explain that though Washu
"created" you, she stills claims to be your Mother?
<Ryoko> Get a life!!!

This is a slightly re-edited and updated
version of the original email.

OAV Ryoko is not human. She's over 5,000 years old;

<Dave> But doesnt look a day over 1253
<Ryoko> You're so kind...

this gives her a different view of time. She's practically immortal, and
can recover
from almost any injury; she can survive untold levels of pain. She
didn't have a childhood. She's been used by just about everyone she's
known, and so doesn't know or understand how normal people relate to
each other. She was brought up by a criminal mastermind who treated her
as a defective toy, useful mainly for distracting others while he stole
the goods. She was encouraged by him to think of people as commodities
to be disposed of when no longer useful.

<Ryoko> Yeah yeah, enough of the backstory, GET TO THE FRIGGIN POINT!!!
<Dave> And they say I like to rant....

Now put yourself in Ryoko's place and think about the situation from
her point of view. Let's begin by turning the clock back 700 years...]

<Vegeta> Well, I was just a lad when my father said....
<Dave> Uh, this isnt a therapists office I hope you know
<Vegeta> What?! How dare you insult me!! Just for that I'll have to
ki...ki.....kiiiii.....SEND YOU TO ANOTHER DIMENSION!!!
<Hawk> Wow, its amazing this guy was able to father Trunks
<Dave> And get it on with Bulma!

At Kagato's command, you've just caused terrible destruction on Planet
Jurai.

<Dave> Moi?
<Ryoko> Ah, memories...

Your mission failed...Kagato will punish you. But that's the
least of your worries. You're being chased by the Crown Prince.

<Hawk> So now the artist formerly known as the artist formerly known as
Prince is now just called Crown Prince?
<Dave> Its Yosho you fool
<Hawk> Oh

His ship is stronger and faster than yours.

<Dave> But YOU have the bitchin stereo system!!
<Ryoko> Word

He chases you down to Earth.
Your ships crash.

You fight...and he's a superior warrior, too. He impales you with his
energy sword. It's the most painful thing you've ever experienced, not
merely the pain of impalement but the agony that you've come to
associate with Jurai energy.

<Ryoko> Jurai, BAD!!!
<Dave> Easy there, hombre

He confiscates your precious gems...the
sense of loss is overwhelming. And yet, as you lose consciousness,
there's a sense of freedom also, as Kagato's control over you is
broken.

<Hawk> You are no longer his sex slave
<Ryoko> (Whacks Hawk) Perv
<Dave> Lovely...

Now, Yousho has imprisoned you in a cold, dark cave. This is a new kind
of cold; not the cold of space, which you could simply shrug off,

<Dave> (Imitating cold of space) Hey baby...
<Ryoko> (Shrugging it off) Get lost

but an internal cold,

<Vegeta> Brain freeze
<Hawk> The cold shoulder
<Dave> Mr Freeze taking over your body

the cold of hypothermia. You have been given barely
enough energy to stay alive, and even maintaining your body temperature
has become tasking.

Seven hundred years pass. You're bored. Very bored. So bored that there
aren't adjectives to describe it in any language. The only thing of any
interest in all that time is the appearence of a young boy who, unlike
everyone else, can see you. And he's not afraid.

(Everyone proceeds to exit the room in typical intermission style)

********
Bohemian Rhapsody is playing in the background while the MSTers calmly
eat lunch in the Theater's lobby.   Vegeta is quite sad because he didnt
bring a lunch and nobody wants to trade him.  But then Vegeta remembers
hes a badass villian with ultra-neato powers and starts a shakedown on
Dave.

<Vegeta> Gimme your lunch money kid!
<Dave> But I dont have any!!  My mom packed me this!!
<Ryoko> Hey man, dont go roughing up anyone here.  If you hurt him, I'll
have to hurt you, and that could destroy the Theater, and then we
wouldn't get paid.
<Hawk> We're getting paid to do this?
<Dave> Wow, being paid to make fun of self-obsessed, moronically stupid
fan fics is cool!
<Ryoko> (Isaac Hayes again) Yer damn right
<Hawk> Well, I'd just like to ask how much we're getting paid
<Vegeta> Well, they told me that you guys were being paid with the
privilege to make out with someone, but they didnt tell me who
<Dave n' Hawk> (Drooling with anticipation)
<Ryoko> You guys took THAT payment plan?  You sure are some sick people
if you want to make out with Noboyuki!!
<Dave n' Hawk> ................THATS FUCKING SICK!!!!
<Ryoko> Told ya
<Dave> I think Im gonna vomit and have a nosebleed at the same time....
<Hawk> No time for that, we gotta get back
<Vegeta> But Im still hungry!!
<Ryoko> Have a box of Animal Crackers
********
You like him. (New sensation. What does it mean to like someone?)

You want out of the cave. You see him chasing dragonflies, and you want
to play with him

<Vegeta> Playing, such a childish emotion
<Dave> I think someone needs some surlines medication

 (play? What does it mean to play? Kagato never allowed
you to play.)

<Ryoko> Sick bastard liked playing with me though

 But you can't get out. You make a plan...you'll start
saving up tiny amounts of the precious energy your jailer allows you,

<Hawk> Until you can buy that new car!!

and when you have enough, you'll burst your bonds. It'll hurt...it'll
be agony, because your body will be short on energy and won't be able
to sustain itself. But the one thing you have in abundance is
determination, and you do it.

<Dave> Just do it
<Ryoko> Whoa, never saw that coming (groan)

The boy's mother dies. (Mother? What's so special about a mother? You
didn't have a mother...at least, you can't remember having one.)

<Ryoko> So Washu doesnt count then?  Explain that one!!
<Dave> Hush, hes just a stupid fic writer, he doesnt know any better
<Vegeta> Hear hear!
<Hawk> Hai soo desu!!

He comes to your cave entrance, crying his heart out. You experience
another new emotion: compasssion. (Where did that come from? Certainly
not from Kagato.)

<Hawk> It comes from watching too many soap operas

You want to comfort him, to touch him, to hug him,

<Dave> Ryoko, pedophile
<Ryoko> (Blasts Dave into nearby wall) Ass

to tell him it's alright and that you're there with him. But you can't.
You put your astral hand on his head but he doesn't notice.

He can't see you any more.

<Hawk> You've blinded him with Science!
<Dave> (As young Tenchi) Shes blinded me with Science!!

Years pass. The boy grows into a handsome young man.

<Ryoko> How I crave that handsome bit of man flesh
<Dave> The spineless handsome bit of man flesh
<Ryoko> (Blasts Dave into another wall)  Im starting not to like you
<Hawk> (Dead silent)

You've almost got
enough energy to break out of the cave...soon, you can be his friend.
(Friend? What's a friend?

<Hawk>(Begins to sing) What is love
<Dave> (Sings too) Baby dont hurt me, baby dont hurt me...
<Hawk> No more

You've never had a friend. There was Ryo-
Ohki - is that what a friend is?

<Dave> If you can call a spasmodically annoying pint sized ball of
meowing space bound fluff a friend...
<Ryoko> One more comment about Ryo-Oh-Ki and I'll beat your ass
<Dave> (Grins) I would like that
<Hawk> Hit the deck
<Vegeta> Right
(Both hit the deck)
Several rows of seats are blasted away by the angry female.  All that
left of  Dave is a smoking crater.
<Hawk> I'll be that hurt
<Dave> Ow

You don't know and you can't ask her.
It's been 700 years since you've been able to talk to her.)

<Dave> I think what this fic is really trying to do is express the
importance of telephones
<Hawk> Bad communication, its a killer

Then a miracle happens. While travelling in your astral form to the
cave entrance, you pass the young man; he doesn't seem to notice the
ball of light floating past him. Somehow, he's managed to get into the
cave.

<Dave> Even though he had the keys, we still dont quite know how Tenchi
got into the cave
<Ryoko> This guy is portraying me like Im some sort of imbecile!!
<Vegeta> New flash, you are
<Hawk> Hit the deck
<Dave> One step ahead of you
The back 12 rows are ripped out of the floor by an amazing blast from
Ryoko.  Vegeta, being quite more powerful than Dave was, easily dodges
being blown to smithereens.  A titanic battle ensues, meanwhile, teh rest
of the crew just continues watching the fic.

You see that the gate at the entrance is open. He's come for you!

<Hawk> Happy happy, joy joy!!

You rush back to your physical body at the bottom of the cave (again,
your rescuer doesn't notice the passing ball), and you prepare to greet
him.

The young man arrives in the innermost part of the cave. If you still
had lungs, you'd be breathless with anticipation.

<Dave> And would die
<Hawk> Amen to that

He kneels beside the pool that imprisons you.

<Hawk> How do you lock someone in a pool?  Its essentially a big bowel of
water
<Dave> You could freeze em
<Hawk> Oh

You reach up, grasp his hand,

<Hawk> In holy matrimony
<Dave> Hawk, that was dumb

pull yourself up. With your decayed body, the effort required is
enormous, but you do
it. You look into his eyes and see...

<Dave> Love
<Hawk> Nausea
<Dave> Revulsion
<Hawk> Your reflection
<Dave> He has no eyes
<Hawk> Terror

Terror.

<Hawk> Damn Im good

What's wrong? He never used to be afraid. What's frightening him now?

You move closer. You try to hug him, to kiss him, to tell him what you
wanted to say a decade earlier: It's alright, I'm here. But you can't.
Your lungs and vocal chords have rotted.

<Hawk> That would explain the "Breathless with anticipation" thing
<Dave> Touche'

 Only a ghastly wheeze emerges.

<Dave> 700 hundred year old morning breath
<Hawk> Asthma of antiquity

Then pain. You remember that pain.

<Hawk> The pain of rejection
(At about this time, the battle between Ryoko and Vegeta ends, with
Vegeta coming out as clear victor.  He and Ryoko sit down and continue
the show)
<Hawk> Hey Ryoko, you're shirts a little ripped
<Everyone 'cept Ryoko> 0_0
<Ryoko> Assholes

It's the pain of Jurai energy, the same pain that impaled you all those
centuries past. He's carrying that
sword, and he's struck you with it. In your agony you can't tell that
he doesn't understand what happened, that the contact was not
deliberate. All you know is that the young man you love, who should
have been your Prince Charming, who should have rejoiced to set you
free, is wielding the same weapon that defeated you before. You've been
hurt again, this time by the one you love. The sense of betrayal is
more than you can handle.

<Ryoko> When you've got a vibrator, who needs a man?

He runs. He's fleeing from you. He was terrified of you.

<Dave> Terrified of the hottest babe this side of the Galaxy?
<Hawk> Absurd!
<Ryoko> (Giggles)
<Vegeta> Hmph

He's just like the others, to him you're just a monster to run from.
Worse, he's
allied with your enemies.

<Ryoko> Ok, this guy just lost me about the part on the allying and the
enemies
<Dave> I think the author is confused
<Hawk n' Vegeta> Our sentiments exactly

You thought he would be a friend, but he's
just another bastard. You expected him to bring you love, instead he
brought you more pain.

<Dave> Thats an Excedrin(TM) headache if I ever saw one!
<Hawk> More pain, more.....waitaminute

Well, pain is one thing you know well. Your rage
at being mistreated yet again comes to the boil.

<Vegeta> Boils are very common at that age
<Hawk> As are pimples
<Ryoko> and high, cracking voices
<Dave> ThaTS tRuE

You're out of the cave now. For the first time in centuries, you're
surrounded with nature's energy. You draw on it, you patch up your
body.

<Ryoko> With the latest patch release, I am now Ryoko 2.65!!!
<Everyone else> Ooh

Your feelings are mixed up; you don't know whether you want to
love him or kill him.

<Dave> Love him, then kill him.  That way, you wont get Necrophilia
charges
<Hawk> And we'll be rid of Tenchi, Forever(TM)
<Dave> Hawk, I think you just inadvertently executed a shameless plug
<Ryoko> You bastards say one more thing about Tenchi and I'll be forced
to hurt you SEVERELY

So you prepare a special battle costume for the
occasion. It gives you total freedom of movement. It covers you, yet
allows you to show off as much as you want when you want. Whichever way
things go, you'll be ready with your new fighting-flirting outfit.

<Dave> I must've missed that part
<Ryoko> News flash, it never happened
<Hawk> This guy has GOT to stop making stuff up

You find him sleeping on the school's roof. When he awakes, you
confront him. You want to be sure he realises how much suffering you've
been through. You talk to him. He claims it wasn't his fault but admits
to being related to the hated Yousho. He's still giving you mixed
signals.

<Vegeta> Why all the self-absorbed meaningless feelings?  SEND HIM TO
ANOTHER DIMENSION ALREADY!!

And so you attack. You're still not quite sure of him. You still love
him. You don't want to kill him, not yet.

<Hawk> You want to toy with him like the sadistic kitten you are
<Ryoko> That I am, mrroww

 Not until you're sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's your enemy,
something you don't want to
believe. But you're going to find out which side he's really on, and
whichever way it turns out, you're going to make sure he appreciates
how badly you've been treated, and just how angry you are.

<Ryoko> This version of me seems to have quite a bit of teenage angst
residing in her
<Dave> This author is going too deep for us.  Tenchi Muyo wasnt meant to
be this deep and involving
<Hawk> Stop messing with my head!!!
(Hawk leaves the room screaming in agony)

Thus begins the most confused, mixed-up, half-baked,

<Dave> Chewed up, spit out
<Vegeta> Neurotic, meaningless
<Ryoko> Idiotic, ass-portraying

 comical yet destructive fight scene in anime.

 END - OR BEGINNING

<Everyone> END
<Dave> I think I speak for everyone when I say that was a pointless waste
of binary
<Ryoko> Yeah, even though it was a portrayal of me, even I didnt enjoy it
<Vegeta> Too much of my time has been wasted.  For this insipid piece of
foppery, the author will have to be killed!
<Dave> Hey, Vegeta got uncensored!!
<Vegeta> Oh yay, Im so very happy
