Free Loop Poem: #1: Sister
By DJ Chan

You came here
Without no fear
To make it clear
And you were dear

You changed my days
In many ways
Saw through haze
And thrashed the blaze

But you're not here
It's been a week
Or an hour
Not a year
As I seek
>From a tower

You were like my sister
Hit my head like a twister
Left a mark like a blister
As you left a note marked, "Mister"

I might never see you
As I say Ohayo
To a friend named Leo
Who could never be you

But you're not here
It's been a week
Or an hour
Not a year
As I seek
>From a tower

It has ended
