No Need for Masks

Grr... I hate getting all sorts of ideas.  Since I don't get to read most
of the stuff coming out, I don't even know if the idea's come out already.
But, I'm in the middle of reviews, and I wanna finish'em, darnit!

The leggy blonde with the 'do ran for cover.  "Eeek!"  Yet another near-hit.

She was quickly followed by the longhaired girl in a red skirt.  "You!  Do
something already!"

"L-like what?"

She flashed her anger at her once more.  "You've got the weapon, use it!"

A nearby blast rocked the surrounding area, and their three other
companions chose to stay with them, after some trouble locating them.

The one-time princess wailed, grabbing the blue-eyed blonde by the neck:  
"Do something!"

The boyish one in green skirts blasted away with electrically charged fury.

The cute and brainy one, in blue, brought out her instant computer.  "The
power necessary to defeat the enemy is too large!"  She stared at the 
ruckus, two women berating the apparent leader, and said clearly, "even she 
couldn't do it."

Silence.  Only bridged by another explosion, and a body flying.

The angry one in red caught their fifth, who looked flush with burns.
She coughed.  "Then it's hopeless."

"No."  The blonde shook off the last assailant (who had the most in common
with her in the group, truth be told), and stood.  "As long as I am alive,
as long as love is alive, I cannot stand by and let injustice happen."
She looked to her companions, her friends.  "Are you girls with me?"

"We are!"

With renewed faith, they five girls stood tall, and rounded the corner.

In the center, the blonde shouted, with the others coming in at the same
time, "Moon...."

"Aqua..."

"Fire..."

"Lightning..."

"Love..."

The old lecher stared down death by alien-spawned, mystic, girl-power.

"Sweeto!"

Mihoshi tossed in the dream.  Smiling.

Having happily defeated the youma, the guy whom everyone once had a thing
for stepped up to her.

Tenchi, in a tux, said to her, "Mihoshi..."

Stars had nothing on her eyes, "Tenchi..."

"Can you take care of little Chibi?"  He put forward a little pink-haired
girl between them.  "I've got to go and get this tux back in time..."

Sasami "waiiii!"ed and hugged her mother.  Ryo-oh-ki just sweated, and
said, "oh, Mihoshi..."

A Tenchi/Sailor Moon meld without a name

Hopefully, no one will notice my name on this.
