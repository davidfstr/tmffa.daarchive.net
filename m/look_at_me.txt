Dear Tenchi,
 
When you look at me,
What do you see?
 
Gently floating on the breeze,
The petals are like our memories.
Your smile caught me in a trance,
You gotta give me one more chance.
How can I explain?
Before, all I ever knew was pain!
 
When you lay down in bed,
Ever wonder what goes through my head?
Thoughts of you Dear, love and fate,
C'mon, I swear it's not to late.
There's so much more to see inside,
If only you'd forget your foolish pride!
 
When you left and closed that door,
I fell down sobbing on the floor.
Tears falling down like rain,
I think I might go insane!
I don't know what to say,
What could make me feel this way?
 
Please don't run and hide,
All I want is to be by your side.
Sit together by the bay,
Waiting for the dawn of day.
Talk about such and such,
Do you really think I ask too much?
 
What have you done to me?
With you I'm so happy, yet in misery!
With gentle eyes and a tender soul,
You're the only thing that makes me whole.
I'll do anything for you,
I just wish you'd say you love me too.
 
What do you see?
What you see is me.
 
Love, Ryoko
