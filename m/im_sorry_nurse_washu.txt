Disclaimer: Tenchi is owned by
Pioneer and AIC yadeyadeyadeya ad

to say at an alarming rate.
The superb (well, mostly superb) Outkast
wrote and performed 'Ms. Jackson' of which
this is of course a parody.

NOTES:
It has taken me ages to just get this one parody done- it's
weird, I just had this mad spree of finishing of all my half-done
fics. Anyways, I had the idea for this a long time ago and I hope
it has been worth the wait- I think so!
This is another Kagato-death fic...there can never be enough of
them, I think.

			"I'm Sorry Nurse Washu"

(Yosho)
Yeah this one right here goes out to all 
the baby mamas, mamas...
Teenage god mamas, 
Hell, mebee even da test tube mamas
Yeah, go like this

CHORUS (Kagato):
I'm sorry Nurse Washu (OOOH)
Please let me free
Never meant to make Sesami cry
Wait a second, I will tell you why
I'm sorry Nurse Washu (OOOH)
Please let me free
Never meant to make Ryoko cry
I apologize don't make me die

(Kagato)          
A baby teacher preacher, wanna fight me
She doin' things like makin her toys come outta her lab
To the Soja, tryin' to frighten me
She need to get a, piece of that dragonball pie and take her bite out
That's right out, I'm gonna re-iterate- this is a think not a 
fight-out
And let her know that I'm her master, not her pupil now
Like Darth Vader she can learn from me, she's just stupid now
I have respect for her and everything- see I ain't the one who got 
locked up
Aw hell no I don't- she a worm who let me mess her daughter cos 
she's so f**ked up
She never got a chance to see my side of the story, I have my pride
She had a post at the Achedemy
>From Jurai I was exiled
I was riled, so what if I'm coming back to have vengence
And wreak a little pain on her friends and descendants, yeah

CHORUS (Washu):
Now I'm Little Washu (OOOH)
Here's is the deal
If you meant to make my daughter cry
I'll test on you and I will make you fry
Listen to Little Washu (OOOH)
I'm keeping it real
If you meant to make Sesami cry
You'll be my ginuea pig before you die

(Kagato)
Me and your daughter
Got a weird ass SM thing goin
You say it's sickening
I say look out when it's snowin'
Cos if you haven't changed your mind
Then watch out for that weather
You can run but you can't hide
>From the ruin wreaker, Nurse Washu
Ten thousand times, you been fooled by me, been blind
The hardest puzzel of yours is no match for mine
Teacher meets pet, then the puppy dog thing, experimental genes
In the test tube like them flashback scenes
Even under Funaho's tree, you can't hide from the winter weather
You may be immortal, but you'll never live 
Forever, forever, forever, ever
Forever never seems that long when you're about to die
And I thought I was eteneral but, oh my
Nurse Washu my plan was good, but not enough I should
Have thought that you would have expected me interecepted me
Captured me, latched me, slapped up me
Screamin' sounding like me 
Only even crazy, er 
I guess you knew so much about me you became me 
It's what I did to, her
Isn't it? And now you want your revenge 
No matter what oc, curs
So go ahead and gloat, like I 
Did and yes I will understand why, and how your gonna do it

CHORUS:
(Kagato)
I'm sorry Nurse Washu (OOOH)

(Washu)

Now how do you feel?
(Kagato)

I'm sorry I went and made Mihoshi cry
I apologize a trillion times
Forgive me Nurse Washu (OOOH)
You makin' me squeal
Never meant to make your daughter cry
Just return me back to Jurai

(Washu)
Uh, uh, yeah
Look at the way he treated us- like shit, everything he knows is 
from me
And everything he owns, from you, you got him through when he was 
up in the creek 
Without a paddle, too weak to battle, now were gonna show him

(Ryoko)
*sniff* Yeah, let's kick him inside out!
I'll stab you right back through the throat so my blades all in 
yo' mouth

(Washu)                  
Now that's what I'm talking 'bout, my girl my little pearl, my world
We're gonna give him a beating, smack him round the world to the poles
And then here again
So who's laughin' on who now, you keep on saying you'll get out
But I'm sorry- memories too strong, we gonna push this little butt-on
Me and mah baby

CHORUS:
(Kagato)
I'm sorry Nurse Washu (OOOH)

(Washu)
Not enough for me           
Never meant to make your daughter cry
Like hell you didn't, you'll be vapourised

(Kagato)
I'm sorry Ms. Washu (OOOH)

(Washu)
About all those things you steal?
You'll never replace the feelings that you've fried
Even after all my tears are dried

(Kagato)
I'm sorry Misstress Washu (OOOH)
Look, I can feel
All of the pain your going through
I assure you I will be true
I'm sorry Lady Washu (OOOH)
My history's sealed
I'll never ever make your daughter cry
If I get out of the place alive....
ARRGGGGGGGGGGGG! No, Mistress Washu!

THE END

Well, I hope that was satisfying for all concerned- apologies
to the Kagato fans. But just being an incredibly cool
character doesn't give you the excuse to be an evil bastard and
rape and torture similarly cool characters in nasty ways.
To anyone who didn't get it, I hope you didn't notice
in all that fevered self-pleasuring over Washu in a nurse costume.
Yeah. Anyways. Yeah. Ploh.
Alright, I guess I really have run out of things to say now,
so fare thee well for now!
Yrs.
