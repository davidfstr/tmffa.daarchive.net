souls to me I now have complete ownership over the Bandit crew...Ohh and the powerpuff girls belong to cartoon network I guess...
		The Bandit Crew 3rd Mst.Mst of"A pair of Scissors and a Rubber Band"
Bandit Roll Call!
<Jimmy>All I want is whirled peas..
<Demon>Rats make this splat sound when ya squish em...
<Psyco>We dont want any!
<Hunter>I just need love..
<Chris>Just shoot me!
::As the prison ship,the SS.Bandit floats through space,its crew sit in the ohh so popular recreation room.
Somehow Psyco has gotten a big screen tv on board the ship and everyone,including Uhsaw,is gathered around its warm glow...
On the screen we see three old toothless vegas hookers,one dressed in pink with red hair and a pink bow,one dressed in green with 
brunette hair and a bleach blonde dressed in blue::
<Uhsaw>Whats this show called?
<Demon>(pushes info on the remote)It says its the Powerpuff Girl's new season...
<All>(shudder)
<Uhsaw>(looks at his watch)Guess what time it is...it's new speacial guest time!
<Jimmy>Who is it this time?
<Chris>(from the fan-fic control room)Well it seems that we have a very speacial guest...just look at the tv...
::As the crew turn their heads toward the TV,furture Blossom smiles a toothless grin and crawls out of the screen,
accidently knocking over the tv,busting it in the process...::
<Blossom>(takes a puff of her cigar and looks at Psyco)Sorry about that hun..
<Psyco>Hey lady you have to pay for that!
<Blossom>(pulls a moldy wad of cash from her bra and hands it to him)There hun...
<Psyco>Umm on second thought,its no problem..really(hands it back to her)
<Hunter>Do you know why your here?
<Blossom>Read fan-fics right?
<All>(Nod)
::With that,Uhsaw dissapears into the control room and a siren can be heard.::
<Uhsaw>Hey idiots you know what that means!
<Blossom>(leaps on the floor and covers her head)ITs the fuzz!
<Everyone else>Umm fanfic...
<Blossom>(gets up and dusts her self off)Ohh why didnt ya say so?
<Uhsaw>Dont make release the hounds!
::Everyone then makes a mad dash into the theater,trying to sit as far away from
Blossom as possible,but somehow she ends up between Hunter and Jimmy.Then theater gets
dark and the screen lights up::

	Tenchi Muyo!Belongs to pioneer and not me..need I say more?

<Jimmy>(sarcastic)No please continue...

			A Pair of Scissors and a Rubber Band
				by Castor Rate
<Guys>O.o
<Demon>I bet that guy got picked on at school...
		
                 Warning:If you are under the appropriate age to veiw this fic,the stop right now!
		go read a pansy fic instead!

<Jimmy>Hey man!I dont think any age is appropriate for reading this!
<Hunter>(crying)Im not a pansy...
<Demon>(puts her hand on Hunter's knee)Your right,your not a pansy...
<Hunter>Really?
<Demon>Your a cupcake...
<Hunter>Gee thanks.

		The day was young,the smell of Spring was hanging in the air and adorable little critters were
	mating.Yep it was the time of year for sex.

<Demon and Blossom>Theres a certain time of year for it?
<Psyco>Get outta town...

		And who knows this better then Tenchi Masaki.But Tenchi had a
	small secret.
<Jimmy>Hes gay..
<Demon>Hey now!Tenchi is not gay!
<Blossom>You go girl!
		No one knew it but he was gay,

<All>(stare at Jimmy)
<Jimmy>I told ya so...

		For weeks now he had been screwing his friend Amagasaki,up the ass

<Hunter>Chris,you so-called holy man!You will pay for this!
<Demon>Yeah Chris,at least when Bob was the fan-fic operater,we didnt have to see lemons!
<Chris>(from the control room)Hey,if you were in my shoes you would have done it to me...
<Blossom>(scratches her arm pit)Well kids,when life gives you lemons make lemonade!

		"Ohh Tenchi,fuck it!"Amagasaki would shout as Tenchi fucked him up 
	the ass with a pair of scissors.

<Guys>'.' O.O O.o
<Demon>Yeah im sure getting screwed up the ass with a pair of scissors is really romantic...
<Blossom>Ive seen a man do that once...

		Then Tenchi would smile as Amagasaki shot blood and cum from his ass.But the girls had no idea
	for the most part they were to busy eating eachother out to notice anything strange.

<Blossom>If I was younger I would find this author and hurt him with my powerpuff powers!::Coughs::Damn cigs..
<Demon>(starts chanting in latin)
<Psyco>(hands out army helmets)
<Jimmy>What are these for?
<Psyco>(points to Demon)Their for the cause...

		Finally,though,Sasami walked in on the boys who were sucking each others cocks,
	when Sasami screamed,Tenchi bit off Amagasaki's dick,spit it out and grabbed Sasami and shoved the dildo up her virgin pussy.

<Demon>(her eyes turn red)Think happy thoughts,think happy thoughts,think happy thoughts!
<Blossom>Whats her problem?
<Jimmy>Really fucked up lemons piss her off...
<Hunter>Well,fucked up lemons of classic cartoons piss me off too..
<Psyco>(looking at his watch then at Demon)Yep,any minute now..

		Soon though,Tenchi sped up and Sasami ripped in half,so Tnechi and Amagasaki ate what was left of her.

<Jimmy>(as Alfred Hitchcock)Yes..even as Tenchi continued to screw her above and beyond,
Amagasaki who was bleeding,and their unknown friend"Tnechi"devoured the young girl...
<Demon>(turns to Jimmy and bares her fangs)Continue and die!
<Psyco>Hehehe...Caster Rate or whatever is going to be so dead.
<Blossom>(coughs)This is worse than that low bodget porn i star in!	
<Demon>(pulls out a sword and slices Blossom's head off)Grrr..Rorororr
<Jimmy>(shuffles the head under his seat)
<Hunter>Feel better now...
<Demon>Bloodlust subsiding..

	Then after they were done eating Sasami,they spied Ryoko.With evil grins on their faces,
Amagasaki and Tenchi ambushed the spacepirate.

<Hunter>Wait isnt Ryoko able to bench press a semi?
<Jimmy>And your point is..
<Hunter>Well I was thinking,could'nt she just kill them?
<Psyco>Hmm Ryoko seems to be a little OOC,as does everyone else.
<Demon>Bloodlust growing!

	Then as the demon's cries for help were drowned out when Amagasaki shoved
his dick in her mouth,Tenchi pulled out a blow torch and fired it up.

<Jimmy>(covers his eyes)
<Demon>(breathes in a paper bag)
<Psyco>(pulls out a bag of marshmellows)

	Then Tenchi shoved the blow-torch up Ryoko's ass and turned it to full blast
which turned Amagasaki's dick brown and crisp.Then as Ryoko lay there barbecued,Tenchi shoved his
arm up her ass and pulled out her guts.

<Demon>(dissapears in a black cloud of smoke,leaving with a cat-like war-cry)
<Jimmy>hehehe,someones gonna get it!
<Psyco>Yep,and Demon is just the one to give this perverted bastard his just desserts..
<Hunter>(looks aroud nervously)I did'nt mean to sniff her panties!
<The rest>O.O
<Jimmy>We meant Castor Whatever...
<Hunter><< >> <<...okay then scratch what I said...

	As they ate the barbecued spacepirate,Tenchi bit Amagasaki's dick off in
the process,leaving him with a hole leading to his intestines.

	::As this image appears on screen,Demon's miniacal laughter can be heard and
	a steaming pile of intestines fall from the air,right into Jimmy's lap::

<Demon>(somewhere in the theater)Hahaha!That was for Ryoko!

 ::The crew then stares up to find Demon with demonic wings,fluttering through the air,
in her arms she carries a fainted man with a giant gash in his stomach::

<Psyco>Heheh,told ya...
<Hunter>(hands Psyco ten bucks)Damn it...you win.
<Jimmy>(places the intestines under his chair along with Blossom's head)

	"Whoa,that turns me on!"Tenchi shouted as he pulled his hard pillar from Ryoko's ass and shoved
it in Amagasaki's hole,screwing him like there was no tommorow.Then as he shot his seed into his friend,
Princess Aeka walked in to the room,which made Tenchi get another evil idea in his head.So as Amagasaki passed out
from pleasure,Tenchi grabbed Aeka,poked her eyeballs out and skull raped her.

::As this happens,a pair of eyeballs drop from the sky and bounce off of Hunter's head,who immeaditely woke up from the nap
he had been taking.As the rest of the crew looked on in horror at the eyes,Demon could be heard laughing sadisticly as the 
man in her arms groaned in pain::
<Demon>Revenge!Fwahahahahahhaha!
<Hunter>Is she always like this?
<Psyco>No,you should have seen her when she read,"Carrots,carrots,carrots"
<Jimmy>O.o

Then as her corpse got rigormortis,Tenchi had a heart attack and died a violent death."Kione,did you hear that?"asked Mihoshi as she lifted 
her head from Kione's pussy."No,Mihoshi,I did't hear a thing!"shouted Kione as she sprayed her juices over all over her partner.
				The end
<Demon>(landing on the ground with an evil glint her eyes and Castor still passed out)So,you like juice huh?
<Psyco>No,Demon!Dont do that!Anything but that!
<Hunter>Whats she going to do?
<Jimmy>(reaches over and whispers something in his ear)
<Hunter>O.O
::The sound of an old car can be heard starting up as the screen goes black,and the crew go and see what Demon is up to::
::In the recreation room::
<Demon>(Placing a pair of jumper cables on Castor's tounge)All right!Hook the cables to the battery!
<Jimmy>(looks around,shrugs and climbs into the car,but not before placing the cables on the car battery)Okay!Roger!
<Demon>Kick up the juice!
VARRRROOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!ZZZAAAAAPPPP!!!!
::As Castor lays there dead and golden brown,Demon undoes the cables from his mouth and motions for Jimmy to get out of the car,
By this time Psyco and Hunter are searching Castor's pockets for any money he may.Then Hunter have picks up a wallet and opens it,only to 
have a pre-historic moth fly out and grab Blossom's body from out of the theater and fly out of the body dissposale unit::
<Psyco>Dammit,he was broke!
<Hunter>What did you expect?
<Jimmy>Yeah,its not like hes making money from that trash he writes.
<Demon>(smiles innocently and tosses Castor's body from the ship)I feel better now.
::Then Uhsaw and Chris appear on the giant re-constructed big screen tv::
<Uhsaw>So,I see you found that lemon,haha,stimulating!
<Demon>Go to Hell Uhsaw,and where is that twisted fucker,Chris?
<Jimmy>(points to off of the camera where Chris can be see huddled in a corner)There he is!
<Chris>(Off camera)Please God,the all mighty...save my soul
<Demon>I'll be right back...(dissapears and appears on the tv with Uhsaw and Chris,then there is static)
<Psyco>(relaxes in his chair)Yep,another day,another bludganing...
<Jimmy>Well lets get our rest..
<Hunter>But you guys!Demon might be killing them!
<Psyco and Jimmy>(Shrug)
::As the crew relaxes,the sound of lightning can be heard and Demon reappears,charred as a marshmellow::
<Jimmy>Hehe,what happened?
<Demon>(points up)
<Chris>(from the executive's room)Thanks God,I owe you one..
<GOD>Dont mention it!
<Everyone onboard the ship>O.O
<GOD>Goodnight everybody!
