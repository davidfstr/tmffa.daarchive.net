Another Day at the Masaki resisdence and another day of argument over
tenchi.Ryoka was acting like a "whore" as normal, hanging allover
tenchi begging for sex.And Ayeka was uncofrotably lokking at Ryoko
whore herself allover Tenchi.
"Ryoko Please stop!!" Tenchi whined as he was trying to carry some
china dishes over to the kitchen for Mihoshi and Sasami to wash.
"Just one kiss.oooh Please Tenchi" she said in an attempt to seduce him
by clinging on to him, making him unstably keep his balance with the
dishes.
"Ryoko please stop, he dosnt want you,and he never will" Ayeka said
trying to talk some sense into the space pirate
Ryoko's pupils Narrowed, and she dissappeared and reapeered in front
of Ayeka pissed.
"What!?Of course he loves me!hes just need some help showing his true
affctions for me, right Tenchi?"She turned around to see that tenchi
was gone.
"That beast" ayeka said under her breath thinking how tenchi and her
were the ones that were truly ment to be together.
"TENCHI!!!"Ryoko said jumping onto him,
"auugh!!Ryoko please stop! you're gonna make me drop the dishes!!!
Ryoko!"Tenchi said attemping to get her off.But ryoko refused and made
him get all wiggly and drop the dishes.Making a huge shattering sound.
"Ryoko now look what you made me do!"Tenchi said angrily.Ryoko stared
blanky at the pile of shards and such, and casually said,
"mihoshi would've broken them anyways" she teleported away to prevent
having to help clean up.Right then Sasami cam running into the spoy
were she heard the shatter, "oh no! thats the brand new tableware that
Mr.Tenchis grandapa bought!good thing he and Nobuyuki are outta town"
"yeah great" tenchi said bending down to examine the shards.Mihoshi
came into the room wondering what happend.
"oh my! look at the mess!"
"Mihoshi can you get a strong bag and a broom?please"
"sure" Mihoshi went into the kithcen and came out with a bag and Broom,
Ayaka came in seeing tenchi and sasami and mihoshi and the mess,she
offerd to clean it up to get closer to tenchi of course.
Ryo Oki stepped near the shards but sasami kept telling her it was
sharp so she shouldnt go near it.Ryo let out a playful meow and ran
upstairs and sasami followed cause Ryo was ready to play."thanks
Ayeka" Sasami said before  heading upstairs.
"yeah,thanks ayeka its a good thing that we have some one like you
around!or I'd be Ryokos!and believe me..thats a creepy to think about!"
Ayeka blushed and giggled
"its okay tenchi,ow please return to what you were doing,Ill clean
this up"
and she bent down to clean up
Ryoko was angry and appeared in front of ayeka arms in akimbo.
"hey what was that you tried to pull of in front of my Tenchi!? ay!?"
"face it Ryoko You and TEnchi are like oil and water,no matter how
hard you try!,you cant mix!" she giggled again and Ryoko was brigh red
"what was that supposed to mean?"
"just simply stating a fact!" she said
Ryoko was not gonna give up, TENCHI WAS HERS AND NO ONES GONNA TAKE
HIM!!
Ryoko hmph'd and teleported off.
Ayeka said under her breath to herself,
"that girls like humpty Dumpty,first she gets humped then she gets
dumped"
"good one Ayeka!" Mihoshi said walking by
Ayeka was startled by the sudden comment.
"thanks,just dont tell anyone okay?"
"Sure!"Mihoshi said
