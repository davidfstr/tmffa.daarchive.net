 So close... I had her right there and she slipped out of my fingers. She was 
within my grasp, and I just let her walk away. I must've been stupid! What was 
I thinking?

And last night wasn't my only opportunity. She's been there every day,
without fail, this past week. I could've done it at any time. Perhaps between
classes or at lunch? 

But I just let her slip through my fingers. I let her go. And last night, I tried,
hurriedly, to propose to her as I left.  I had to hurry away... if anyone saw me...

But I think I gave her the wrong impression.

 I'm one of the bravest of my profession...
 ... so why couldn't I say "I love you, Ryoko?"
