                  LIFES LOSSES AND GAINS by Ryoko82039
                        (Ryoko's point of view)
 
 
Life was fine,
with my mom and I,
then a man came,
and took her away.
 
 
From the man he took,
friends,family,oh what a crook.
What had I done wrong,
to become the hated,
oh this is wrong.
 
 
My life was a wreck,
it was stolen from me,
this is not how its supose to be.
 
 
All alone in a cave,
so dark and cold,
a life so worthless,
I feel so old.
 
 
I was so alone till a boy came,
and I felt so worthless and full of shame,
for his mother had died,
and he was alone,
why could'nt I help,
oh everything is wrong.
 
 
That boy freed me one fine day,
but my love was stolen away,
that dumb princess,
and ditized slut,
they stole my only love away.
 
 
A childhood stolen,
and also a love,
for these things I am unloved.
The passion is gone,
there was no romance,
just a dream here to pass.
 
 
Thats what he thinks,
I wish it were not so,
I feel betrayed,
my heart he stole.
 
 
I found my mother while fighting the man,
she wanted me to call her mom,
but I cursed her instead.
 
 
I was not happy,
she was next,
she tried to take him away,
and my happiness.
 
 
They were all there,
ruining my dreams,
why could'nt they see,
they were hurting me?
 
 
Life was cruel,
now I have friends,
they fight for me,
and I fight for them.
 
 
I still love the boy,
with all of my heart,
I hope he will be mine,
I trust in my heart.
 
 
Things will change,
like all things do,
but the love in my heart,
will always stay true,
to my beloved,
Tenchi I love you.
