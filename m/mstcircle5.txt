Full Circle Part 5
WRITTEN BY: Adam Chris Leigh
MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans a.k.a. JOLT!!!

Yah! Rejoice Samantha fans! Samantha is back and this fanfic is about to
feel her full wraith! My 39th MSTied fanfic and still going strong!
Damn, I'm good! Uh... sorry, that was the caffeine speaking... note to
self: Only have *half* a pot of coffee for breakfast, not an entire pot.

LEGAL STUFF: All the Anime characters in the following MST belongs to
the talented and creative people who made them. Please don't sue me for
I am merely borrowing your characters and not making any claim on them.
The Club Anipike belongs to Nightbreak, whom I am grateful to for
allowing me to use it. Kali Hoteru belongs to John Hurst a.k.a. CrowBar.

Now, on to the story!
________________________________________________________________________

Even as the powerful forces of the Deuce Es Machine pulled her away from
Bret Hart, Samantha was screaming his name. The strange energies
threatened to rip her apart as they pulled her away to god-knew-where.
Pushing her sorrow to the back of her mind, Samantha tapped into her
inner soul and began thinking of her home away from home...

"Anipike, Anipike, Anipike, Anipike..." she thought over and over in her
mind, hoping against hope that her thoughts would bend the energy to her
will and transport back to the popular club.

Suddenly, with a final surge of energy, the redhead appeared...

...three kilometers above the Club Anipike.

"DAMN YOU MCMAHON!!!" she shouted as gravity took hold and pulled her
down. Even outside of her stories, the redhead did not know how to focus
her inner warriors energy to fly. Also she didn't even know if her
reflexive durability, a side effect of her inner warriors power, would
protect her enough to survive the landing in one piece.

A couple hundred feet from the ground, Samantha closed her eyes and
concentrated on durability, hoping against hope that she would survive
the fall.

Suddenly, something strong and metallic wrapped around her body and she
opened her eyes to see the world tumbling about her. The wind was
knocked out of her when the metallic 'something' grew tighter. After the
world had stopped tumbling about, she felt the tightness open up and saw
that it was a purple colored hand. Looking up she saw the faces of EVA
units 00, 01, and 02 looking down at her.

"Owww," Samantha was finally able to say after a minute.

Seeing that she was okay, Unit-01 placed the redhead on the ground and
waved good bye, all three EVA's going back to their game of tag.

"A good thing they were there," Samantha thought as she stood on shaky
legs. She glanced about and saw that she was in the parking lot of the
Anipike. With the brush of death gone now, her mind turned back on being
torn from her love.

"DAMN YOU MCMAHON!!!" she screamed, turning the heads of several
characters from Tank Police. Growling, her dress torn in some places,
Samantha walked up to the doors of the Anipike and slammed them open.

"Get me a fanfic!!!" she shouted. "Any fanfic!!! I'm pissed off and I
need something to take it out on!"

"Now," Kali started, a bit taken aback by the redhead's sudden
appearance. "If that ain't timing, I don't know what is!"

"You're back!" Washu said.

"I'm back all right.. and I'm mad as hell! How *dare* he take me away
from the one I love!!!"

Everyone at the table blinked, surprised by this announcement.

"Uh... who are you talking about?" Ryoko asked. Then she took in
Samantha's current state of dress. "And why are you dressed like that?"

"Hey Washu! You still have any of ACL's fanfics unMSTied?" Samantha
asked, totally ignoring Ryoko.

"Yeah... I got part 5 of Full Circle all ready to go," Washu replied.

"Get it going," Samantha said as she stomped her way into the theater.

Everyone in the Anipike blinked, shocked by the sudden change in the
redhead's attitude.

"What happened to her?" Rei asked.

"Let's find out," Ryoko said as she walked into the theater, quickly
followed by Washu and Rei.

"Something tells me I had best stay out of this," Kali said.

"Wise man," Misato commented as she walked up and took the empty glasses
off the table.
*****

[Washu, Rei, and Ryoko entered the theater and took their seats
alongside Samantha, who was seated in the fourth.]
RYOKO: What's the matter with you?!
REI: <whispering to Washu> Subtlety went straight out the window.
SAMANTHA: <bitter> I'm fine!
RYOKO: No you aren't! You're acting like one of those damn SI
characters!
SAMANTHA: *sigh* I'm sorry... really, it's nothing guys. Could we please
start the fanfic, Washu?
WASHU: Okay. [Summons her smoky black laptop and types on it]

SAMANTHA & RYOKO: <mutter curses under their breath>

>Establishing Scene:

SAMANTHA: My fist colliding with Adam's chin.
REI: That said establishing, not pleasing, Samantha.
SAMANTHA: Oh, sorry.

>RYOUKO is sitting on the broken roots of a

>she is crying into the bloody headband that used to belong to TENCHI.
>RYO-OHKI flies into view and RYOUKO stands and teleports away from
>the tree.

SAMANTHA: The hell...?!?! Oh yeah, I had completely forgotten how ol'
Adam rips off scenes from the OVA series for his own fanfics.
REI: In other words, he's a talentless hack.
SAMANTHA: Exactly.

>
>Cut to the interior of RYO-OHKI

ALL: OUCH!

>where AEKA is sitting on the floor in
>shock and MIHOSHI is standing in the background.  RYOUKO appears
>between the two of them looking at the viewscreen.

WASHU: Who was looking at the viewscreen? Ryoko? Or Aeka and Mihoshi.

>
>                          MIHOSHI
>               <wearily> Ryouko?

REI: <Mihoshi> Was it good for you?
RYOKO: REI!
SAMANTHA: Yeah! You got to it before I did!

>
>                           AEKA

>               Its all over now,

SAMANTHA: This fanfic? Wow! That was short!

>we must challenge

>               do.

WASHU: Actually, you could sue for copyright infringement...

>
>                           AEKA
>               I’ll tell you what we can do,

SAMANTHA: <Aeka> KILL ADAM!!!
RYOKO: <softer> What happened?
SAMANTHA: [on the verge of tears] Nothing... I'm fine...

>               <louder> we can find Tenchi, that’s
>               what we can do.

REI: *Then* you can get out of this fanfic!

>RYOUKO throws TENCHI’s bloody headband at AEKA.

WASHU: *BAM*
REI: <Aeka> Oww!

>She grabs it then
>looks at it for a second.  We can see tears form in her eyes.
>
>                           AEKA
>               Is... Is he...?

SAMANTHA: <Aeka> Getting a better cut of the pay?

>Cut to RYOUKO,

ALL: OW!
REI: That's beginning to hurt!

>she takes her earring off her left ear and puts it in
>her wrist.

SAMANTHA: [gritting teeth] She gripped it in her hand, Adam, her hand...

>It immediately glows and her battle garb turns red on that
>side of her body.
>
>                          RYOUKO
>               You have one <beat> Give it to me.

WASHU: <Ryoko> I don't know how you have one, I just do.

>AEKA hands the already glowing gem that TENCHI gave her to RYOUKO.
>RYOUKO puts the gem on her other wrist which promptly turns that side
>of her outfit red.

RYOKO: Should I point out the fact that my battlesuit is both red and
black?
SAMANTHA: <sarcasm on high> If there was any chance of genius boy here
listening, then yeah. But otherwise, don't waste your breath.

>                          RYOUKO
>               Katago will pay for all that he has
>               done. <beat; louder> Ryo-ohki! Lets
>               GO!

REI: <Ryoko> Out of this fanfic!
WASHU: Shades of Tseuno there.

>Cut to outside of RYO-OHKI,

ALL: OUCH!
RYOKO: About how many more times can we do that joke before it gets old?

REI: I don't know.

>the ship turns and heads at full speed at
>the Souja.  A few meters from the edge of the ship it encounters an
>energy field

SAMANTHA: Uh... meters? Excuse me, Adam, but have you ever seen the OVA
series before? Huh? Have you?!?! [growing frantic] With the size that
Ryo-oh-ki and the Souja are, it would be a bit more then just a FEW
METERS YOU JERK!!! WATCH THE SHOW FOR ONCE YOU STUPID IDIOT!!!
[Everyone else blinks at this outburst]
WASHU: If you want a break, the all you've gotta do is say the word.
SAMANTHA: [wipes away a tear] I'm fine... I just went through... I
mean...
REI: [pats Samantha on the shoulder] It's okay. Tell us when you're
ready.

>which it hits and pushes against until it breaks through.
>
>Fade to inside of Souja,

RYOKO: *whew* Thank god it wasn't cutting. Anymore of that and we would
have ran out of band aids.

>KATAGO is staring into his globe again with
>an unconscious ADAM behind him.

SAMANTHA: Unconscious or dead... guess what *we* wish for?

>KATAGO laughs maniacally and we
>still hear his laugh when the screen fades to black.

WASHU: Crap, they ran out of film.

>                    Twisted Plot Productions
>                            Presents

SAMANTHA: Crap.
REI: Is it just me, or has that joke been done for every single part of
this series?

>               In Association with Tempest Creations
>                  A Division of Starlight Pictures

REI: 'Jen' Starlight?

>                           FULL CIRCLE

RYOKO: What comes around, goes around.
SAMANTHA: <growls> Got that right...

>                      By Adam Chris Leigh

SAMANTHA: Grrr...
WASHU: Careful Sam. You growl anymore and I'll have to give you shots
for rabies.
SAMANTHA: <weakly laughs> Thanks Washu. *sniff* I needed that.

>                    Based On “Tenchi Muyou”

RYOKO: Grrr... That's spelled 'Muyo' you idiot!
WASHU: Looks like I'll have to prepare that rabies shot for two.

>                       By Masaki Kanajaki

WASHU & RYOKO: YOU'RE THE BEST, MAN!

>                   EPISODE 5: We Need Tenchi!

REI: Wasn't that OVA # 6?
RYOKO: You actually expect Adam to follow the continuity of the original
series?
REI: <British> Sorry. Right blunder there.

>Establishing Shot:

SAMANTHA: Me using Nav's...
WASHU: Don't, Sam. You're going to use up your quota of dark comments.
SAMANTHA: Can I borrow some of yours then?
WASHU: No...
SAMANTHA: But you don't use them! <child-like> Please?
WASHU: <chuckles> No!
REI: Good to see you back to normal, Sam.
SAMANTHA: Me? Normal? I'm insulted! <chuckles> Thanks... I'll talk about
what was bothering me later, okay?
OTHERS: Okay.

>Funaho and the trees that surround it glow with a
>mild intensity as not to attract attention yet

REI: Run up the electric bill.

>show of their unbound
>power.  SASAMI runs down a path in the trees that leads up to Funaho.

RYOKO: So she's heading down, but going up... uh... I'm confused.
WASHU: We're not far behind you.

>She is crying as she runs.

REI: <Sasami> Why him?!?! Why couldn't we have had a good self-inserted
author?
SAMANTHA: There is one?
REI: Yeah, of course there is. You haven't heard of Beans?
SAMANTHA: I stay away from the stuff. Gives me gas.
OTHERS: <groans>

>                          SASAMI
>               Tenchi <beat> No, Tenchi, please
>               don’t die.  Please Tenchi, don’t
>               die.
>
>SASAMI trips and falls in her sadness.

WASHU: [blinks] I have nothing to say to that.
RYOKO: Did she drop it on the ground earlier?
SAMANTHA: That would explain why she's falling into it now.
REI: Or it could be someone else's sadness she's falling into. Sasami's
not exactly known for being dark.
SAMANTHA: <Raven> They were always against me. I was alone except for my
sadness. Quote the Raven. Nevermore.
REI: You hung around those wrestlers too long, Sam.
SAMANTHA: [fights back tears] <whispering> It was never too long around
Bret.

>She looks up to see Funaho
>in front of her, sending its faint shots of light

RYOKO: That's a new word for 'rays'.
WASHU: Maybe it's Nav's new gun...

>into the surrounding
>water.  SASAMI wipes the tears from her eyes and stands up, facing
>Funaho.  As she speaks, she is slowly surrounded by light until it
>engulfs her whole.

SAMANTHA: Isn't surrounded and engulfed essentially the same thing?

>                          SASAMI
>               By the power of the space trees whose
>               roots planted deep in the fathoms of
>               time and life, I call upon the power
>               of the tress and of their network. By
>               the power of the space trees, take me
>               to Tenchi.
>
>SASAMI disintegrates into light and energy then flies into Funaho.

WASHU: Light is merely a *type* of energy.
REI: This fanfic brought to you by the Department of Redundancy
Department.

>Cut to the inside of the Souja.

ALL: OUCH!

>KATAGO is floating in front of ADAM
>who is still inside the capsule.

SAMANTHA: If Adam is in that capsule...
RYOKO: Which is the same kind as the one I was in during the filming of
OVA # 5...
SAMANTHA: Then shouldn't Adam be worried about his oxygen supply?
REI: <Kagato> Holes! I knew I forgot to punch some in the top!

>ADAM looks at KATAGO with scorn and
>sneers as he talks.

WASHU: Kagato immediately takes a disliking to Adam's attitude and
blasts him away.
SAMANTHA: I'm not doing the rejoicing joke. It's been done to death.
RYOKO: <British> And there was much rejoicing.
ALL: <blandly> Yay.

>                           ADAM
>               What do you want with me? How could
>               you be so cruel! You claim to be
>               Ryouko’s creator but you needlessly
>               killed the only person who ever meant
>               anything to her!

SAMANTHA: [blinks] Wow... I'm...
REI: Shocked?
RYOKO: Surprised?
WASHU: Stunned?
SAMANTHA: All three s's... yeah... Who would have thought that Adam
could talk without being condescending to the regular Tenchi cast?

>                          KATAGO
>               Don’t be patronizing me,

WASHU: <British> I'm the King and I can do whatever I want!

>I care not

REI: <Tseuno> For this fanfic.

>               for the pseudo-feelings she says she
>               has.  She is worth little more to me
>               than dust.

RYOKO: Ashes to ashes... dust to dust...

>                           ADAM
>               Then why did you come this far to get
>               her?
>
>                          KATAGO
>               For the gems of course. Little did I
>               know that a sorry whelp like you would
>               have a gem and she wouldn’t.

SAMANTHA: [points at Kagato] I like him.

>Which
>               is, of course, why I have you now.
>
>KATAGO makes a fist and electricity sizzles around the capsule
>lighting the capsule up in a green hue.

WASHU: When did Kagato start decorating the Souja for Christmas?

>                          KATAGO
>               So tell me, what are you? Surely you
>               can’t be what you appear to be, the
>               gems don’t give up their power to
>               just anyone.  Humans especially
>               aren’t able to grasp the power of
>               the gems, so you are an enigma.

SAMANTHA: Huh? Uh... wha?!?! What the hell is going on here?
RYOKO: In the last chapter, Adam got one of my gems embedded in his
hand.
SAMANTHA: <stunned silence then> I take back whatever good things I've
said about Adam.

>                           ADAM
>               <Yelling; hatefully> I’m as human
>               as any other person on this earth!

REI: Not according to Mihoshi's psychological report, you aren't...

>                          KATAGO
>               Surely not, and even you have seen
>               that there are many people on your
>               Earth that are NOT normal.

SAMANTHA: Yeah! You show me one normal human and I'll show you...
<pause>
RYOKO: Adam in a thong?
OTHERS: ACK! RYOKO!!!

>                           ADAM
>               I’m human! And if I’m not, I don’t
>               know otherwise.

REI: How does one *not* know they're human?

>                          KATAGO
>               Is that a bit of doubt I hear in
>               you’re voice? <beat; laughing>

WASHU: So Adam's real name is Voice?
RYOKO: Ya got me.

>We
>               will see just what you are made of
>               boy!

SAMANTHA: I could name them, but we're trying to keep the PG-13 rating.

>The electricity around the capsule ignites and electrifies the
>capsule.  ADAM screams in pain then writhes on the floor of the
>capsule until he is unconscious.

SAMANTHA: Yeah! Do it again Kagato! WOOHOO!!!
WASHU: You're enjoying this too much.
RYOKO: [waving about a huge foam hand on her hand] YAY!!!
REI: [is chomping down on popcorn]
WASHU: And you two aren't helping!

>KATAGO’s eyes widen then he turns
>away from the capsule and looks into his globe.

REI: <Kagato> Baywatch is on.

>                          KATAGO
>               I had no idea. <beat> There are more
>               things in heaven and earth than are
>               dreamt of in my philosophy. <beat>

RYOKO: Wow Kagato... that's deep. Got any popcorn left, Rei?

>               It would seem that you need be
>               conscious for further investigation,

SAMANTHA: No he doesn't!

>               so I will deal with you later. But,
>               now...
>
>KATAGO turns and walks over to an organ, sits, and plays out an
>ominous song that can be heard throughout the Souja.

WASHU: That's some sound system he's got on that ship.

>Cut to another hallway inside Souja,

ALL: OUCH!

>RYOUKO, AEKA, and MIHOSHI are
>dressed in battle gear and looking at a four-way fork in the corridor.
>
>                           AEKA
>               What do we do now?

RYOKO: Ennie... menee... minie... moe...

>                          RYOUKO
>               All the hallways will lead to him.
>
>AEKA nods and the three split up, each going down a different
>corridor.  As RYOUKO is going down a corridor, a pair of faces
>appear and attack her.  While flying, she creates an energy ball
>that blasts through each face.  AEKA encounters the same faces
>but she uses her Jurai power to fly through them.  MIHOSHI also
>gets attacked by the faces, she uses a large bazooka-type weapon
>on them, sufficiently blowing them apart.

WASHU: Amazing how Adam managed to get this part of the show right and
nearly everything else wrong.

>Cut to space,

ALL: OUCH!

>the upper part of TENCHI’s body is floating next to
>the TENCHI-KEN.  A piece of branch covers what would be the end of
>TENCHI’s torso and the bloody remnants of his internal organs.
>AZAKA and KAMIDAKE are creating a forcefield around TENCHI, as he
>floats in space.

REI: *whew* A good thing he wrote that in or else I would have thought
that Tenchi's body would be falling in space.

>A bright light appears and ten Light Hawks Wings
>surround TENCHI.  A woman dressed in Jurai royal robes (TSUNAMI)
>appears standing above TENCHI in space.  She moves through the
>forcefield and looks closely at TENCHI’s face, then turns around
>and merges with him.  The Light Hawk Wings close over the two of
>them and turn into a white mass.
>
>Cut to a unusual looking gateway,

ALL: OUCH!

>on one side is a hallway with a
>large wall at the end, on the other side is a misty, dark filled
>void.  RYOUKO sticks her head out of the gateway, the rest of her
>body is being hidden by the mist.
>
>                          RYOUKO
>               Now which way?

RYOKO: Ennie... menne... minie... moe...
SAMANTHA: Isn't that useless considering that you said earlier that all
paths lead to him?
RYOKO: Yeah, but it's fun.

>The wall at the end of the hallway spreads apart in sections
>revealing a large curtain that parts to a dark pathway.

REI: Is it always this dark on the Souja?
WASHU: Not really. He just had to darken it for the shooting for the OVA
series.

>
>AEKA steps out of the gateway next to RYOUKO.
>
>                           AEKA
>               Looks like an invitation.
>
>                          RYOUKO
>               Sure does, it would be rude of us
>               not to accept.

ALL: Don't accept! Don't accept!!!

>RYOUKO smirks as they both walk down the hallway and through the
>parted wall.

WASHU: A good thing it's parted. Aeka can't walk through walls like you
can, Ryoko.

>A few seconds after they start going through the wall,
>MIHOSHI sticks her head out of the gateway.
>
>                          MIHOSHI
>               Hello? <beat> Why doesn’t anyone
>               ever wait for me.

REI: <Mihoshi> Not even my question marks wait for me!

>As MIHOSHI runs down the hallway, pan backwards to see that MIHOSHI
>is walking upside down on the floor and AEKA and RYOUKO are walking
>right side up so it looks like MIHOSHI is walking in their
>reflections.

SAMANTHA: Uh... run on... sentence.. getting... dizzy... [falls out of
chair]
RYOKO: [gets up and helps Samantha back up]
SAMANTHA: Thanks, Bret.
RYOKO: 'Bret'?
SAMANTHA: [blushes] Sorry.
WASHU: [ignoring Samantha and Ryoko] Didn't Adam see OVA # 6 or is he
just making this stuff up?
REI: What makes you say that?
WASHU: Well he had several chunks right but he completely forgot about
Mihoshi's control cube teleporting her to the opposite dimension of
Kagato's ship.
REI: I guess Adam is trying to make Mihoshi as useless as possible.

>AEKA and RYOUKO walk down a narrow bridge over a dark void and end up
>in the great hall that KATAGO and the unconscious ADAM are in.  KATAGO
>finishes playing the organ and stands.

WASHU: RYOKO!!!

REI: <Kagato> Finding the bathroom.

SAMANTHA: So Aeka is a super Sayinn now.

>                            AEKA

REI: <Aeka> YOU HORRIBLE FANFIC!!!

>AEKA hits a forcefield in front of KATAGO but continues to try to

REI: But how could she fly into him when... ah forget it! I'll just
chalk it up to bad writing!

>                           KATAGO
>               <laughs> Is that a term of affection

SAMANTHA: Kagato's not too smart when it comes to women, eh gals?
OTHERS: Got that right!

RYOKO: Even though he said that his ship protects him from any attack,
we'll just toss that aside since Adam's too lazy to actually watch the
OVA and write down the lines.

>KATAGO moves his hand and a burst of energy hits AEKA and blasts her
>aside.

ALL: SUPER VEGITA BIG BANG ATTACK!!!

>When AEKA is out of the way, RYOUKO appears behind KATAGO and

RYOKO: Even though I shot him in the face first!
SAMANTHA: <Adam> Look! I'm just writing this to boost my own ego, not to
follow the show's stupid continuity!

>KATAGO writhes and screams,
>then he disintegrates in a cloud of green smoke. RYOUKO gasps.

REI: <Ryoko> Peeyou!!! What is that smell!

>                           RYOUKO
>               Ahh, his shadow!

WASHU: <Deep voice> The Shadow knows...

>KATAGO immediately grabs RYOUKO’s neck and holds her high.

SAMANTHA: <Kagato> With this catch, I'm *sure* to win the fishing derby!

>                           RYOUKO
>               Damn you <gasps for breath> Katago!

RYOKO: Actually, during the filming of OVA # 6, I was cursing his
breath. Guy forgot to brush earlier.

>                           KATAGO
>               Perhaps you like being imprisoned...

>RYOUKO’s arm begins to turn gray and stiff. It slowly progresses
>through her body.

SAMANTHA: This guy sure has a way with women, doesn't he?
WASHU: Actually, he's quite the gentleman once you get to know him.
SAMANTHA: Not like Nash.
WASHU: Who?
SAMANTHA: I'll explain later.

>                           RYOUKO
>               No... Katago... DON’T!

>KATAGO drops RYOUKO’s solid body to the ground.

REI: <makes sound of stone cracking apart>
RYOKO: Solid... yes... Fragile? Most definitely.

>               Such a worthless creation, now
>               princess, its your turn.

WASHU: Someone should really teach Adam how to correctly use the period.

>Cut to MIHOSHI walking down a narrow bridge crossing a black void.
>At the end of the bridge is a pair of stone snakes on either side

SAMANTHA: Not the dark chaos crystal!
REI: ASADAE flashback?
SAMANTHA: Yeah.

>               always the one left behind? Oh! Now
>               where am I?  This looks strange...

WASHU: <Mihoshi> All these works of good authors: "Knight on the Town"
by Tim McLees, "Three Pages Long" by Megane 6.7, and "The Sometimes
Self-Conscious Nerima Rangers" by J-Boogie. What are they doing here?

>Behind MIHOSHI, the two statues come to life and turn into two large,
>white snakes that leer over MIHOSHI.

REI: Uh... weren't they already snakes, but just statues?

>She slowly turns around.
>
>                          MIHOSHI
>               Oh no, oh my! Bad snake things! You

RYOKO: Who does Adam think Mihoshi is? Kasumi?

>MIHOSHI opens fire with her arm gun as the snakes begin to approach

SAMANTHA: Despite the fact that they were energy blasts, not bullets.

RYOKO: <Mihoshi> Appearances in bad fanfics.

>MIHOSHI looks up at the two frozen snakes and sighs.

SAMANTHA: Urge to make... sick joke... overwhelming...

>                          MIHOSHI
>               That will be all.
>
>A large crack forms on the iced monsters which quickly spread out
>over the two frozen snakes.

WASHU: So there was iced monsters as well as two frozen snakes.
REI: I think Adam was referring to the frozen snakes when he said the
iced monsters.
WASHU: Why didn't he just say so?
REI: Do you really want me to answer that?

>                          MIHOSHI
>               Oh no... you aren’t remaining
>               still. OH! What do I doooooo?!!

SAMANTHA: Call your agent and make sure that this doesn't get made into
a fanfic.

>MIHOSHI begins searching for things in her huge pocket again,

RYOKO: It was her control cube!

>pulling out all sorts of unidentified objects.  One of the objects

SAMANTHA: Sweet Jesus! Adam's not even following the show anymore! He's
making up stuff as he goes along!
RYOKO: Must not rant... must not rant...
REI: [is searching through her pockets] Now where did I put that scroll
to?
WASHU: <Announcer> Yes, now you too can make up history for any Anime
Universe you want! For free advice, just call 1-800-ADAMBLOWS!

>                          MIHOSHI

RYOKO: May I suggest... BOOT TO THE HEAD!!!

>The cracks on the iced snakes join and the snakes break free from the

WASHU: Hey! My name is spelled with only one 'U', Adam! Get it right!

>MIHOSHI opens her eyes to see the mouth of one of the snakes a few

WASHU: Grrr...
SAMANTHA: A good thing you can't throw Ki blasts, or else the theater
would be a smoldering wreck.

>WASHUU stands between the two stone snakes and moves her hand, both

WASHU: [gritting teeth] Just like Adam's writing talent...
OTHERS: WHOA!!!
RYOKO: That was harsh, mom!
WASHU: I'm right and you know it!

>                          WASHUU
>               We don’t need these things anymore.
>               <beat> Now, come to mommy.

SAMANTHA: Can't... say it... too sick... a comment... to make...

>WASHUU raises her hands and the stone RYOUKO raises up from the ground
>and fades back into the living.  WASHUU walks around her and looks
>at her features.

REI: At this part, the show reminds me of a dealer looking over a
classic corvette or something.

>                          WASHUU
>               Well, nothing seems to be broken. The

SAMANTHA: Huh?

>RYOUKO, who was still a bit phased from being turned to stone then
>turned back, realizes that WASHUU is in front of her.

RYOKO: Oh. You're in front of me.

WASHU: I said sex appeal, you dope! And stop spelling my name wrong!

>               <growls> How dare you, you little

SAMANTHA: Tsk, tsk. What a way to speak to your mother.

>                          WASHUU
>               <nonchalant> That isn’t the way you

ALL: SHE SAID YOUR MOM!!!
RYOKO: I see that Adam has forgotten about my good hearing when he made
the script.

REI: Ignoring the fact that Ryoko was created 1200 years ago, this
sounds like the ultimate setup for a Jerry Springer Show.
RYOKO: I got dibs on hitting Jerry first!
WASHU: No, I do!

SAMANTHA: And you've been wearing that for years. Man, your BO must've
been some bad!
WASHU: Hah hah... very funny Samantha. [types on laptop and a bucket of
water appears over Samantha, spilling on her]
SAMANTHA: Hey! This gown shrinks with cold water!

WASHU: You know, I'm kind of tired trying to point out everything that's
wrong with this script.
REI: You mean the misspelling of your name and your lines.
WASHU: Exactly.

RYOKO: Like aerobics, weight lifting, and marathon running.

SAMANTHA: We know already.

SAMANTHA: Absolutely not. I never could understand any of that

Full Circle series was.

REI: [breathing heavily but is much calmer] I'm fine... I'm fine... It's
just that...
SAMANTHA: When we get out of here, I'll buy us a few kegs of beer and
we'll get pissed, okay?
REI: Okay.

>                            PLUTO
>               No, that is why I have brought Adam
>               here.  Tenchi will fail, and Katago

RYOKO: <growling and fighting hard to stay calm> So, the last few
chapters...
SAMANTHA: [gritting teeth] Three of which *I* reviewed alongside Mike
and the bots...
RYOKO: Was nothing more... then one huge setup... for Adam to save
everyone's ass...
WASHU: Not to mention giving away a key plot point of the OVA series.
REI: Nice to see you all join me in revenge plotting land.

>                           TSUNAMI
>               Who is the boy?

RYOKO: *Boy* indeed.

>                            PLUTO
>               A disciple of mine.

SAMANTHA: No offense to the Senshi, Rei...
REI: None taken.
SAMANTHA: But if Pluto is accepting people like Adam as her disciple,
then her standards must be dropping.
WASHU: Actually, the worst part about all this is that ACL is soon
coming out with a OVA version of this series...
SAMANTHA: Please tell me that you and the rest of the Tenchi cast are
all going to refuse it...
WASHU & RYOKO: ...
SAMANTHA: <whispering> Sweet Jesus...

>                           TSUNAMI
>               You answer my questions, yet you
>               elude them.

SAMANTHA: Pluto and Oliver North would get along great.

>                            PLUTO
>               You have no need to know at this
>               time.  His motives will be revealed as
>               time progresses.

REI: Don't you mean *your* motives? After all, he is *your* disciple.

>                           TSUNAMI
>               Why won’t you tell me?  Even Katago
>               couldn’t find out what he was.

WASHU: <Tsunami> I promise! Pretty, pretty, please?

>                            PLUTO
>               I cannot reveal who he is, or why he
>               is here.  But you must trust him more
>               than you trust me.

RYOKO: Were this a real fanfic, this scene alone would have to be five
times over.
SAMANTHA: Why is that?
RYOKO: Probably because Tsunami would be laughing her ass off at that
last line.

>PLUTO waves her staff in a circle and ADAM appears next to her on the
>stepping stone.  He looks around dumbfounded.

WASHU: Come on Pluto... make like Ifurita and swing that staff at his
head!

>                            ADAM
>               Who...
>
>                            PLUTO
>               Watch.

REI: I had this nice digital wristwatch, but it got broken during
filming one day.

>PLUTO waves her staff again and the lake changes images from space to
>Earth in a suburban town.  A young man (ADAM) in a black trench coat,
>blue jeans and a white T-shirt, and long hair tied in a ponytail down
>his back is standing on the roof of a school.  Great gusts of wind blow

>his coat around in fury as another man (GARY) climbs up onto the roof
>with some effort and walks over to ADAM who looks like he’s in great
>pain.

WASHU: Where is this happening to?
RYOKO: Actually a better question would be *why* is this scene
happening.
REI: And who's that Gary guy?
SAMANTHA: If we're lucky, he'll be the one who pushes Adam off the roof.

>                            GARY
>               Its over, man.  Her immune system
>               rejected the donor heart and it’s
>               too late to find another one.  The
>               doctor’s say 5 days max.

RYOKO: What is? This scripts life?
SAMANTHA: If it is, then it's less then five days.

>                            ADAM
>               I’m the same blood type as her, you
>               know. <beat>  Just a few misplaced
>               steps and she’d have another donor
>               heart.

REI: Sorry, Adam, but trying to fool us into thinking you're a good
person... It's too late now.

>GARY looks at ADAM then off the side of the school to parking lot
>below.  He quickly grabs ADAM and pulls him a few extra feet from the
>edge.

ALL: BOO!!!
REI: I think this story is getting to us.
SAMANTHA: Ya think?

>                            GARY
>               <louder> Look man! This happens some-
>               times, you have to deal with it.
>               Killing yourself won’t save her life,

SAMANTHA: But it'll make us feel better!

>               its too late for her.  Don’t destroy
>               yourself because of her, she’d never
>               want it that way.
>
>                            ADAM
>               You don’t know her very well.  She was
>               very keen on living.

WASHU: Which means that she wouldn't want you to throw your life away,
you idiot!

>                            GARY
>               I’d never let you do it.
>
>ADAM turns to look down the side of the school again, then turns back
>to GARY.

REI: <German> I wanted to tell you... I've always loved you.
SAMANTHA: Wow! Now that's obscure!

>                            ADAM
>               You could never stop me. You have no
>               idea what it will be like for me
>               to not have her around. Every day that
>               she isn’t there I’ll know, I’ll
>               remember exactly what she looked like
>               the last time I saw her. I’ll remember
>               why she died, how I could have stopped
>               her, that crucial fact, that one thing
>               that I never got to say...

WASHU: Is it just me, or does anyone else recognize the bad placing of a
young man with suicidal urges in the Tenchi Universe?
REI: I do.
SAMANTHA: Uh-huh.
RYOKO: Right behind ya, Mom.

>ADAM takes a few steps closer to the edge of the roof.

RYOKO: I could chant 'do it, do it' over and over again, but it looks
like he already about to...
SAMANTHA: [is fighting hard not to cry] You idiot... I got torn away
from my love with the chance I might not see him again, and you don't
see me trying to end my life! God damned coward... [wipes tears away]
I'm gonna need a good drink after this.

>                             GARY
>               Its not like you never had the chance,
>               Dammit! You saw her ever day, thought
>               about it every minute. If you never
>               told her that you loved her, than it
>               was totally YOU’RE FAULT!

ALL: YEAH!!!
REI: You tell him, Gary!
SAMANTHA: I never thought that I would like an original character from
an ACL story.
RYOKO: Surprises all around, eh Sam?
SAMANTHA: [blushes] I had almost forgotten that the SOL had MSTied that.

WASHU: A dash of humility every now and then is good for the soul.
REI: Or in this case, both of yours.

>ADAM swings around and punches GARY.

ALL: BOO!!!
WASHU: Hit him back, Gary!

>Both are surprised that the
>punch wasn’t very strong.

REI: And so are we.

>GARY brushes off the small trickle of
>blood coming from his nose.
>
>                             GARY
>               <quietly> This brooding won’t change
>               anything.
>
>GARY climbs over to the edge of the roof and climbs back down to
>the ground.  ADAM turns to stare off the building again.

WASHU: Whoa, check your sentence Adam. That does not sound right.

>Another
>set of footsteps appear behind him.
>
>                             ADAM
>               I believe you now, Pluto.

SAMANTHA: What?!
RYOKO: So trying to kill yourself automatically attracts Sailor Pluto,
one of the Outer Senshi and the protector of time.
REI: That's not true and you know it!
WASHU: Right now, Rubeus and the four sisters are traveling to the
present, screwing up the timeline, and paving the way for evil to win.

>PLUTO walks up beside ADAM and stares off of the roof with him.

WASHU: From what I can make of that sentence, their eyes rolled off the
roof.
OTHERS: EWW!!!

>                             PLUTO
>               You’re getting better at that, and not
>               just from my help.

SAMANTHA: So the Outer Senshi is giving lessons to Adam on how to become
*more* suicidal.

>                             ADAM
>               I’ll do your work, if you tell me
>               one thing.

REI: <Adam> How much does it pay.

>                             PLUTO
>               I’ll promise no such thing.
>
>                             ADAM
>               Why now?
>
>                             PLUTO
>               Why not?

RYOKO: Ugh... was Adam one of the guys who helped Joe Eszterhas with the
screenplay to Showgirls?

>                             ADAM
>               I have the innermost sinking feeling
>               that you won’t ever say anything more
>               than that. Maybe its just this whole
>               situation that’s bothering me.

WASHU: It's this whole screenplay that's bothering us!

>PLUTO takes her time staff and

REI: Swings it really hard at...
SAMANTHA: No, I got the schtick for dark comments this time around.

>touches it to ADAM’s forehead, it
>glows and the symbol of a star with a sword through it appears on
>his head briefly.

REI: Grrr... [begins glowing a bright red]
SAMANTHA: <sarcastic> Wow! A male Senshi! [suddenly notices Rei] Uh...
when did *you* get a battle aura?
WASHU: About the same time that she realized that this means another
fanfic series of how Adam becomes a Senshi and plays a pivotal part in
defeating all the Sailor Moon villains.
SAMANTHA: *whistle* You got all that from one simple act of anger?
WASHU: Actually, it was just a guess... but it's pretty damn possible!

>                             PLUTO
>               I’ll call you when I need you. You do
>               my work now.

RYOKO: <Tom Servo> Acting!
REI: [battle aura has faded] Come on! Pluto has more emotion then that!

>PLUTO turns and leaves.

SAMANTHA: Then suddenly turns around, swinging her staff really hard at
Adam's...
WASHU: Give it up, Sam. It ain't gonna happen.

>ADAM keeps staring off the roof of the school
>watching as the dark nexus of clouds to the east moves closer to the
>school.

REI: So a freak thunderstorm is going to take out Adam?
RYOKO: We can only hope.
SAMANTHA: How come you're not saying anything to them?
WASHU: Because they haven't made as many dark comments as you have.

>Cut to the inside of TSUNAMI,

ALL: OUCH!

>the lake turns opaque again.  ADAM turns
>to PLUTO slowly.
>
>                             ADAM

REI: The next to be bent by your god-like abilities.

>ADAM looks at TSUNAMI, who smiles in return,

RYOKO: <Tsunami> Must no let disgust for Adam show... Must not let...

>then down at her reflection
>which shows SASAMI.

SAMANTHA: That's gonna come back to hunt us... I know it.

>                             ADAM
>               <angry> Why don’t I remember anything?

WASHU: Well maybe if you stopped drinking every once in a while, you
would actually remember something.

>               And why did you wait so long before
>               calling for me?

REI: <Pluto> I forgot your pager number.

>                             PLUTO
>               You were suicidal, depressed, almost
>               clinically insane.

SAMANTHA: <angry> Then how come the guys in white didn't lock you up?

>Since then you have

>               is obvious.  What you must do now isn’t.

REI: <confused> Uh... I... er...
SAMANTHA: Sweet Jesus... please don't let this go where I fear it might.

RYOKO: Well, we all know that Adam is going to save the asses of the
Tenchi cast.
WASHU: <thinking> 'Knowledge you retain...' What do you make of that
Rei?
REI: It sound suspiciously as if Adam is setting himself up to be
smarter the Ami.
SAMANTHA: And Amy?
REI: I don't doubt that.

>                             ADAM
>               Wha...? <beat> Oh, god. Aeka! Ryouko!
>               They’re all in danger.

<Stunned silence>
SAMANTHA: I'll be damned... the guy's actually concerned about someone
else besides himself.
REI: A day which will live in infamy.
RYOKO: Don't worry. Adam'll screw it up somehow.

>                            TSUNAMI
>               You must help Tenchi defend them.

ALL: <shocked> Help Tenchi?!?!
REI: You were right, Ryoko. It didn't take Adam too long to screw it up.

>               Katago is a universal threat, his
>               legacy must end here.  You have
>               been given power, that gem in you
>               hand will allow you to summon power
>               equal to that of Ryouko’s. Please,
>               help Tenchi defend the innocent.

WASHU: Like the gems helped Ryoko all that much... Whoa! Adam is as
powerful as Ryoko?!?!
RYOKO: I knew he was gonna screw it up, I just didn't think it would be
*that* bad.

>                             ADAM
>               I will.  I must, I cannot just stand
>               by when I can do something.

SAMANTHA: Actually, you doing nothing would help immensely!

>Cut to the Great Hall.  KATAGO is leering over AEKA when an energy
>bolt cuts into his arm and sticks halfway through.  KATAGO quickly
>turns to see RYOUKO standing with her arm held out.

RYOKO: I need Super Washu Zord... NOW!!!
OTHERS: AHHH!!!
REI: Don't do that!

>                             KATAGO
>               I see you’ve finally found your way
>               back here.  No doubt you’re looking
>               for a rematch.

SAMANTHA: <Mike Tenay> Yes, last week on Thunder, Kagato took out Ryoko
with a choke slam! Now Ryoko is back and itching for revenge!!!

>                             RYOUKO
>               I will KILL you for what you did to
>               Tenchi.

REI: Too bad Adam is gonna ruin it.

>               I’ll destroy every last trace of your

WASHU: Kagato sounds kind of bitter... which is strange since *I* was
the one who made Ryoko.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: OUCH!

>A large blueprint is laid out over the
>floor.  WASHUU and MIHOSHI are sitting on one part of the blueprints.

SAMANTHA: <Washu> So as you can see, there'll be three bathrooms in the
new house design, one for the top floor, basement, and ground floor.
REI: <Mihoshi> Very nice. But wouldn't it be better to have just two
bathrooms, thus giving more room for bedrooms on the top floor?
SAMANTHA: <Washu> True but...

>                             WASHUU
>               The ship is composed of two layers,

WASHU: Why we aren't falling up, I have no idea.

REI: Sounds like my driving instructor.

>                             WASHUU

>WASHUU falls again.

WASHU: Stop spelling my name wrong! And I said D'OH! as well.

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: OWW!

>RYOUKO flies close to a pillar and a green

RYOKO: There was no art on the Souja!
SAMANTHA: Details, details...

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: OWW!

>WASHUU and MIHOSHI are both standing.
>WASHUU has a hand to her head.

REI: Does that mean she has a bloody stump at the end of her arm now?
OTHERS: EWW!

RYOKO: Don't say it , Rei, you've done it to death.

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: OUCH!!!

>RYOUKO dodges more energy beams from KATAGO.

REI: Did Koopa help to transcript the action?

>She dodges an energy beam and cuts through a pillar causing it to

RYOKO: <Aeka> I need Jurai Tenchi Zord power... NOW!!!
SAMANTHA: What the heck did you review while I was gone?

>The pillar continues to fall and crushes KATAGO beneath it.
>RYOUKO flies down and stands on it.

WASHU: <Ryoko> I claim this land in the name of Spain!

RYOKO: He almost was, during the filming. Good thing we had medics on
hand.

>KATAGO reaches through the pillar to grab RYOUKO’s foot and swings

REI: And Kagato immediately shouted for a lawsuit.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: OUCH!

>WASHUU and MIHOSHI is watching the battle

REI: Maybe your gems needed recharging, Ryoko.

SAMANTHA: What way? A game of cards? Details, man, details!

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: Ouch.
REI: It's not hurting so much now.

>KATAGO is being held by the RYOUKO statue and

WASHU: 'At' would be a better word to use, Adam.

>                             RYOUKO

>                             KATAGO

SAMANTHA: The one thing I've always been grateful for about Anime
villains: their lines aren't cliché.

>                             RYOUKO
>               Huh?

REI: HE SAID... ah, forget it.

>The stone hand cracks open and begins to crumble. When KATAGO is free

WASHU: It's always around this time that Mount Ryoko always has an
avalanche.

>The real RYOUKO falls out of the statue

ALL: Oww.

>who is screaming
>because the pieces are about to fall on her.

ALL: WELL DUH!!!

>RYOUKO teleports from
>the falling debris and appears next to AEKA. She picks her up and

RYOKO: You know what I've always loved about script?
REI: What?
RYOKO: The suspense.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Oww.

>WASHUU and MIHOSHI are still where we left

SAMANTHA: Thanks for telling us that. I thought they would have been in
Hawaii by now.

>                             MIHOSHI

WASHU: How they get the caramilk into the caramilk bar!
SAMANTHA: Product plug # 3.

>                             WASHUU
>               That’s why Ryouko isn’t using her

SAMANTHA: I could make a really sick joke about beans and a lit match,
but I don't feel like it.
RYOKO: Who would have thought that even *our* lines... [indicates
herself and Washu] could be so MSTable.
REI: Anything can be riffed... you just got to have the imagination for
it.

SAMANTHA: <Washu> Strip down and get busy!!!
RYOKO & WASHU: SAMANTHA!!! [both take foam bats out from under the seat
and start hitting her with them]
SAMANTHA: Hey! Quit it, quit it! That tickles!
RYOKO & WASHU: [puts foam bats away]

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: Ouch.

>KATAGO flies towards AEKA and RYOUKO throwing
>energy beams as he gets closer.

REI: Kagato would make a great pitcher.
SAMANTHA: Then maybe he ought ta sign up with the Toronto Blue Jays.
They aren't doing so good this year.

>RYOUKO flies up and creates an energy
>sword and swings down at KATAGO.

REI: <shouts Tarzan swing cry>

>Again, a dozen or so logs appear

WASHU: Remember that day?
RYOKO: [rubbing backside] Oh yeah. Nearly cracked a rib in that scene.

>He turns to AEKA.

SAMANTHA: <British> Milady, shall we dance?

REI: <Kagato> You've been a bad little princess. Go to your room and no
supper for you tonight.

>As KATAGO approaches her, she descends into the floor to KATAGO’s

SAMANTHA: Watch out for plot holes!

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Oww.

>AEKA ascends from the floor and falls
>into MIHOSHI’s arms.  WASHUU dusts off her hands.

RYOKO: Hang on here! Washu didn't use the control cube to get Aeka into
the reverse world!
REI: But she did in the OVA.
WASHU: <Mexican> Key plot items? We don't need no stinking key plot
items!
SAMANTHA: I have this horrible sense of foreboding...

SAMANTHA: And he can't get to what is essentially the basement of his
ship?
WASHU: If he did go down there, then he would be trapped.
SAMANTHA: Oh, that makes sense.
REI: Now wouldn't that be embarrassing... <chuckles> Does triple A
unlock reverse dimensions?

RYOKO: Insert stress relieving laugh here.

>Cut to the great hall,

ALL: Oww...

>two pairs of feet step into the great hall
>at once.  They go unnoticed as they move down the bridge over the

SAMANTHA: It was the police officer, there to give Kagato that ticket
for speeding.
RYOKO: Hang on... at about this point, I should be using Mom's diversion
to get out of that wall and back on my feet!
REI: Just toke it up to the author's originality...
OTHERS: ORIGINALITY?!?!
REI: Whoops, sorry. Wrong word. My bad.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Oww.

>KATAGO turns around and waves his hand.
>A previously opaque glass turns transparent and shows earth in center

WASHU: Oh for crying out loud! Not the string on the ice cube trick!

>The sounds of chirping computers and sizzling streams of electricity
>echo through the room.

REI: So his computers turned into birds and the streams of electricity
are well done?

>                             WASHUU
>               What did you do?

RYOKO: <Kagato> Just plugged in the Souja's block heater to your house.
Hope you don't mind.

ALL: DEEP 13!!!

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: Ow.

>The pairs of feet

WASHU: There's more then one?

>get over the bridge and
>walk over to the area where RYOUKO and KATAGO were fighting.

SAMANTHA: Who is this, anyhow?
REI: Is this Adam?
RYOKO: And where's Tenchi?
WASHU: Patience. All of your questions will be answered.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Oww.

>A pair of cross-hairs are over Earth.

REI: Cool! Kagato's playing Duke Nukem!
WASHU: Product plug # 4.
SAMANTHA: That's my line!

SAMANTHA: The author? Already did that.

>               FIRE!

RYOKO: In a ship in space is *not* good news.

>Cut to the exterior of the Souja.

ALL: OUCH!
REI: [massages neck] That one hurt a bit.

>The main gun charges up a shot
>and fires.  The beam travels across space towards earth.  Just
>before it reaches earth’s atmosphere it is absorbed by an invisible
>force field.  A white beam of light shines from where the beam hit
>the field.  It splits into ten Light Hawk Wings as a large ship
>materializes (TSUNAMI) and the wings attach themselves to the ship.

SAMANTHA: How much did the special effects for this cost?!
RYOKO: You would be surprised...

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Ow.

>Everyone is surprised.

WASHU: For Adam had not shown up to save everyone's butt.

>                              AEKA

>                             KATAGO

SAMANTHA: <Kagato> Here Tsunami! Good Tsunami!

>Cut to space,

ALL: Oww.

>dozens of beams of energy appear around TSUNAMI and

WASHU: No, actually Kagato had the bass on his sound system up too high
again.

>Cut to the Great Hall.

ALL: Ow...

>Start at the two pairs of feet then

WASHU: So there *was* more then one pair.

>pan

SAMANTHA: Or you could say a Jurain Battlesuit.

RYOKO: Oh yeah... <derisive snort> That's bound to intimidate Kagato...
and where the heck am I? Sleeping in the wall?

>                             TENCHI

>KATAGO grins again and disappears from the
>reverse world to appear in the Great Hall.

>Cut to RYOUKO,

ALL: Ow.

>who manages to pull her head from the stone to look at
>TENCHI.

WASHU: <sarcastic> After all, Ryoko couldn't do much more then that!
REI: I believe this is where the OVA goes *out* the window and Adam
starts making stuff up.
RYOKO: <sarcastic> Oh, like he hasn't been doing that before.

>                             RYOUKO
>               Tenchi? Is that you?

SAMANTHA: Won't say it. After all, you *did* take a nasty pasting into
the wall.

>Pan over to show TENCHI and ADAM facing KATAGO.

ALL: GET ADAM!!! GET ADAM!!!

>Sparks of electricity jump up from the floor and pull the TENCHI-KEN

RYOKO: Don't forget the ones in my wrist.
SAMANTHA: And didn't Tenchi try to cut Kagato and vow to die first
before any of the women came to harm?
REI: And where's Azaka and Kamidake?
WASHU: <sarcastic> Not to mention that their attack was such a *great*
success.

>TENCHI tries to pull the TENCHI-KEN

SAMANTHA: *RIP*
RYOKO: <Adam> AAAAHHH!!!
WASHU: Eww! There's blood all over the floor!

WASHU: No.

RYOKO: It wasn't voice over, he spoke it aloud.

SAMANTHA: <Sean Connery> Never give up! Never give up!!!
WASHU: And a cookie goes to whoever gets that.

>Both TENCHI and ADAM look up towards TSUNAMI the ship, both having

REI: Pretty easy for Adam considering how empty...

SAMANTHA: <Tsunami> Actually, I just believe in Tenchi. Adam, you can
bite me.
WASHU: Well, that was certainly mature.
SAMANTHA: The impending event where Adam saves everyone's butt is
getting to me.

WASHU: I see he's switched to his high beams.

SAMANTHA: Actually, Tenchi stood up. Adam was still clutching his
bleeding stump of an arm.

>Cut to space,

ALL: Ow.

>TSUNAMI is pulled into a hatch in the Souja and the
>Light Hawk Wings completely disappear.  The hatch closes over the

WASHU: That doesn't happen. It gets close, but it doesn't enter the
Souja..

SAMANTHA: Adam doesn't, but Tenchi does.
RYOKO: You're going to regret those words.
SAMANTHA: <sadly> I know.

>KATAGO raises his hand and a large green energy bolt flies and hits
>TENCHI and ADAM, causing a great smoke cloud to form.

WASHU: If Tenchi wasn't there, then this would be a time for
celebration.

>                             KATAGO
>               Pitiful.

REI: The script? I couldn't agree with you more.

>Four white beams of light shine through the smoke, and turn into the
>Light Hawk Wings.

ALL: WHAT!?!?!
RYOKO: <shocked> But Tenchi can only call up three!
SAMANTHA: <shocked> What's the fourth one for?!?!

>                             KATAGO
>               How is it possible? I thought all the

WASHU: But what about the cable and phone?

>The smoke clears and we see TENCHI holding out his hands with the
>four wings emanating from him and ADAM standing next to him with

RYOKO: <angry> What do you mean, *his* gem?

>                             KATAGO
>               Its you! How is it possible?

WASHU: Whim of the author.

>One of the wings moves to ADAM’s hand and transforms his outfit to
>white with a black ‘V’ shaped stripe through it.  The last wing moves

RYOKO & SAMANTHA: AAARRGGHH!!! THEY CAN'T BE SHARING THE WINGS OF THE
LIGHT HAWK!!!
REI: You're surprisingly calm about all of this, Washu.
WASHU: Call it the patience of one who has been around for a long time.

>Cut to the reverse world.

ALL: Ouch.

>Everyone is watching the action going on
>in the circular viewscreen.

SAMANTHA: That little no good son of a...
RYOKO: When I get my hands on him...
REI: Amazingly, he never changed into a fuku or anything.
WASHU: That's a scary image.
REI: But a possible one.

WASHU: <gritting teeth> I did not say that.
REI: Remember, patience and all that.
SAMANTHA: Screw patience! I'm gonna beat the crap out of Adam after
this!
RYOKO: Not without me you aren't!
WASHU: Violence doesn't solve anything.
SAMANTHA: No, but it's fun.

>Cut back to KATAGO.

ALL: Oww.

>                             KATAGO
>               NO! Its impossible!

WASHU: Yes, it is. Adam is writing this and we do not have any control
over this.

>KATAGO raises his hand and hundreds of crystals rise out of the floor
>and head towards TENCHI and ADAM.

RYOKO & SAMANTHA: FORGET TENCHI!!! GET ADAM!!!

>TENCHI turns his sword into a

REI: Oh great. Adam: Jedi Knight.
WASHU: <to Ryoko and Samantha> Okay you two, no ranting.

>KATAGO blocks with his energy sword and
>the two blades crackle as they touch.  TENCHI creates another sword

RYOKO: No, he didn't. He retrieved the boomerang, changed it back into
an arm guard, and then into a sword.

>KATAGO kicks ADAM which

>A large white flash hides the actual connection.  When the light dies

>                             KATAGO

WASHU: Like I said: Author's whim.

>Where the cut across his torso would be, KATAGO’s body begins to

>RYOUKO turns around to see WASHUU standing next to TENCHI. She
>storms over.

WASHU: Hurricane Ryoko swept in today, demolishing all in it's path.

>                             WASHUU
>               Would you like to my guinea pig??

WASHU: I also said, 'I like you', but who cares about that? It was only
what the script was originally meant to be.

>RYOUKO grabs WASHUU and pulls her away from TENCHI.
>
>                             RYOUKO
>               <angrily> MOM!!

RYOKO: Yeah! Tenchi's mine tonight!
SAMANTHA: Won't say it... won't say it...

>                         AEKA & MIHOSHI (O.S.; sim)
>               Hi Tenchi!
>
>RYOUKO turns around to see AEKA and MIHOSHI next to TENCHI, she
>growls then starts to cry.

REI: Hey! What happened to Sasami?

>WASHUU walks over to ADAM.

WASHU: Ah! Target practice!

>                             WASHUU
>               How about you? Would you like to be
>               my guinea pig?

ALL: AHH!!!
REI: Adam has really sunk low.
WASHU: You all know I wouldn't do that.
RYOKO: We know, mom.
SAMANTHA: But you have to remember who's writing this.

>ADAM puts his hand behind his head.
>
>                              ADAM
>               Guinea Pig?! For what?

SAMANTHA: If he doesn't know, then I ain't gonna tell him.

>All the greetings are cut short when the Great Hall splits down the
>middle and shifts a bit.
>
>                              ALL (sim)
>               Huh?!!
>
>                             WASHUU
>               I guess he cut through the whole
>               ship as well.

SAMANTHA: That's some sword! Could I have one for?
WASHU: If you're good...

>Cut to space,

ALL: Ouch.

>the Souja is split in half and slightly shifted.

REI: Taking that to a body shop is going to cost *someone* an arm and a
leg.

>                              ALL (V.O.; Sim)
>               Lets get out of here!!

RYOKO:  <Tseuno> Good for them!

>The Souja explodes in a giant supernova.  The shockwaves echo
>through the Solar System and into deep space.

WASHU: Which is really impossible since there is no air in space. It
makes no sense really!

>Cut to the Masaki House.

ALL: Ouch.

>AZAKA and KAMIDAKE are standing at
>the gates to the house.  From off screen a newspaper flies and hits
>AZAKA and falls to the ground.

REI: And here I thought the post men were getting bad.

>                            KAMIDAKE
>               What was that?

WASHU: It was a bundle of pulp which is made from...
RYOKO: I think he knows, mom.

>                              AZAKA
>               I don’t know.

SAMANTHA: And these are Guardians of the Jurai Royal family?

>In the background a semi-large explosion goes off

REI: Semi-large?
RYOKO: You know... kind of large, but not big enough to be large.

>and AEKA and RYOUKO
>can be heard yelling at each other.

RYOKO: Quit using my razor!
WASHU: <Aeka> Stop using my conditioner!

>                            KAMIDAKE
>               Its going to be a nice day.
>
>                              AZAKA
>               Yes, another peaceful day on planet
>               Earth.

SAMANTHA: I had almost forgotten how peaceful it was over to your house.

WASHU: You ain't seen nothing yet.
RYOKO: Yeah! Try coming over when we have our Christmas party.

>Fade to Black.

REI: <singing> Here come the men in black.

>Authors Notes (Much?):

SAMANTHA: I hope not!
WASHU: Does that question mark mean that he doesn't know how much author
notes he's made?
RYOKO: I have no idea.
REI: I'm with Samantha when I say that I hope it's not much.

>----------------------
>       Five down, several more to go.

ALL: ARGH!!!

>For those of you who are
>unfamiliar with the Tenchi Muyou OAV series,

WASHU: Go right out and watch them. They're a hell of a lot better then
this series!
REI: Isn't that OVA?
SAMANTHA: Shh. Naughty.

>this episode would be
>similar to the end of the first OAV series.

RYOKO: No, it isn't. OVA # 7 with the Mihoshi special *is* the end of
the first OVA series.

>But since this is
>more like the TV series, that little bit of information is irrelevant,
>ignore it.

SAMANTHA: <Borg> Important information is irrelevant. You will be
assimilated. We are Adam Chris Leigh.
REI: I sure as hell don't remember you two and the rest of the Tenchi
cast fighting Kagato in show # 5 of the TV series.
RYOKO: Adam *definitely* needs to watch the OVA version.
WASHU: Like that's gonna help fix the horde of mistakes he made!

>       Finally I have some of the relationship between Pluto and Adam
>on paper (or screen more likely),

RYOKO & WASHU: NOT IF WE HAVE OUR WAY YOU WON'T!!!

>but now I have to decide where I’m
>going to go with it.

REI: You mean it was going somewhere before?
RYOKO: What, don't tell me you didn't see Adam continuously staying on
the sidelines, insulting Mihoshi, and generally not contributing at all?

WASHU: And don't forget how he barely fought at all when Kagato first
appeared.
REI: <sarcastic> Oh my. I must have missed those chapters.
SAMANTHA: Lucky you.

>Adam is very different than the rest of the
>Tenchi characters, and I don’t know how well he will contrast with the
>rest of the cast.

SAMANTHA: He contributes nothing, insults Mihoshi, and generally stays
out of the way of fights and YOU'RE WONDERING HOW WELL HE'S GONNA
CONTRAST WITH THE TENCHI CAST?!?!?!
REI: Calm down...
WASHU: Why is he talking about Adam like he's another person?
RYOKO: There's two Adam Chris Leighs?
[Everyone shudders]
SAMANTHA: Are you trying to give me gray hairs?

>       I have a plan to translate TMiL into my universe, but before I
can
>do that, I have to introduce one more character.  Look for this
character
>in FULL CIRCLE, EPISODE 6: The Calm Before The Storm.  See ya then.

ALL: ARGH!!!
WASHU: I have a horrible sense of foreboding.
REI: Why is that?
WASHU: Just think about it. This is based mainly on the TV series,
right?
REI: Yeah.
WASHU: Well, that storm sounds amazingly like when the Dimensional Cause
and Effect Controller runs amok in Time and Space Adventures Volume 1.
OTHERS: Oh... dear... god...
WASHU: Uh-huh. That means at least a chapter for every world that it
makes.
SAMANTHA: But that's about...
RYOKO: Five more chapters...
REI: Uh... maybe I can get Shampoo in here to replace me.

SAMANTHA: Why the hell couldn't it have crashed?!?!
REI: Wishing death on the author will not make this fanfic go away.
RYOKO: The script for one.
REI: Yeah, that too.
WASHU: Lets go get that drink now.
SAMANTHA: No argument here.
[All get up and leave the theater.]

"And then I came in the door and... well... you know the rest," Samantha
said.

"That really bites," Rei said before tipping her mug back and downing
the rest of her beer.

"Don't I know it," the vigilante said as she refilled her beer mug from
the keg at the table and drank it. "I didn't really figure you for a
beer drinker, Rei."

"It's not that bad," the Senshi said, indicating her mug. "Mind you,
it's not like I drink a whole lot either."

"Well after reading that fanfic," Ryoko said. "I think *any*one would be
induced to drinking by it."

"Got that right," said a slightly tipsy Washu.

"So what shall I put on the bulletin board about Full Circle Part 5?"
Misato asked as she approached the table, her tray laden down with a
large bowl of taters.

Samantha thanked her and payed for the food, diving right into it.

"Script for fanfic induces a need to be in a drunken state," Rei said.

"Really?" Misato asked. "Was it that bad?"

"Oh yeah," Ryoko replied. "Although, as usual, there were very little
spelling mistakes, there were some sentences that made absolutely no
sense, plus the Author Avatar played a very little role in the plot."

"And lets not forget that it calls for Sailor Pluto, protector of the
time stream, to bring Adam into playing his destiny, which is to defeat
Kagato," Washu added.

"And then the jerk doesn't!" Rei shouted, her face growing red from
anger. "I mean, all he does is stand around!"

"Should we forget the loss of several key plot items? Like Mihoshi's
control cube?" Samantha asked.

"Don't get me started on that," Washu said.

"Okay... so what's next?" Misato asked.

"I'm gonna get pissed drunk and figure out a way to get my love off the
satellite of Nitro," Samantha said, chomping down on another tater and
then taking a huge drink of her beer.

"Should I get Piccolo to drive you home? Or should I let you sleep it
off on the floor?" Misato asked, smiling.

Everyone at the review table chuckled. "Damn, it's good to be back,"
Samantha said.

Misato left to attend to other customers and the redhead leaned back,
chomping on taters and drinking beer as her friends filled her in on
what she had missed. However, her good mood was soured slightly when her
mind drifted back to the surprises revealed to her back on the SON.

Pipkin was still alive *and* partnered up with Mcmahon. This surely
meant trouble for the AAAT. Not only that, but one of the Powers That
Be, Shinji, had intervened on her and the wrestlers behalf, stating that
they had a destiny to fulfill in the second AAAT.

What destiny did they have to fulfill was so important that one of the
PTB had to help them through the last chapter of ASADAE? Was there an
evil so strong that not even the PTB could handle them by themselves?

Samantha chuckled at a joke Ryoko had finished when she was in
mid-drink, accidentally bringing it up through her nose. She wiped the
beer away and playfully punched Ryoko on the shoulder.

"Well," she thought. "Whatever happens, I'm back and that's what matters
now. And I'll find a way to get you off the SON, Bret. You and all the
others. Then we'll teach Mcmahon and Pipkin not to piss off a bunch of
wrestlers and a vigilante."
