Hi, this came as yet another Tenchi song about what would happen if
Ayeka Caught Tenchi and Ryoko together.

Artist: Shaggy
Album: Hotshot
Title: It Wasn’t Me


(Yo’, dad) Yo’
(Open up, dad) What do you want, Tenchi?
(Ayeka just caught me) Doing what?
(You know "ahem")Oh With who Tenchi?
(Ryoko, you know) I so proud of you son!
(Dad! I don’t know what to do) Say it wasn’t you
(Whatever)

Ayeka came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with Ryoko next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Bangin’ on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Oh, you’ve another woman access to your villa
Just a sign of weakness all left on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a
killer
Best to view the situation ???
The real true player left ???
???
Never admit to her when she say
And she claim it didn't happen no way

But she caught me on the counter (oh no)
Saw me bangin’ on the sofa (It not what it is)
I even had her in the onsen (It wasn’t me)
She even caught me on dads camera (It wasn’t me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn’t me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn’t me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn’t me)
She said my life was over

Ayeka came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with Ryoko next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Bangin’ on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her
>From what she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn’t me

Make sure you break your connects
Whenever you should see I make the gigolo flex
you were hiding in washus complex
Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs
You know she remembered upon the past
now that she found out you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (It wasn’t me)
Saw me bangin’ on the sofa (It wasn’t me)
I even had her in the onsen (It wasn’t me)
She even caught me on dads camera (It wasn’t me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (It wasn’t me)
Heard the words that I told her (It wasn’t me)
Heard the scream get louder (It wasn’t me)
She said my life was over

Ayeka came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with Ryoko next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Bangin’ on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve
caused I’ve been listening to your treason, it makes no sense
at all If you tell her that I’m sorry for the pain that I’ve
caused You may think that you have prayer, but you’re life is
completely lost

That’s why I sing

Ayeka came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with Ryoko next door
Picture this, we were both buck naked
Bangin’ on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
