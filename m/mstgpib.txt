Author's notes: Well, this is my first fanfic, and I did a MST.  I
guess it seemed easier to make an MST then to make an entire FF.
since this is my first, go a little easy on the flames... okay?

Tenchi Muyo belongs to AIC and Pioneer, and MiB belongs to Fox.

to the author:  i wish i could mail you, but you didn't include any sort
of email or well, anything in your fic.  if youre pissed at me, dont act
on it 'cause its you're fault.

It was yet another typical day on the Satellite of Love.  Gypsy was busy cleaning the
bathroom after Tom got out, while Mike was trying to separate the two
'bots, who were in a fight.

"I can't believe you spent two hours in the bathroom!  I've had to go
for three!!!!!" shouted the golden robot with a net.

"Well, why didn't you think of that before?? Huh!? You must've been too
slow!"  Yelled Tom Servo.

"Calm down you two or I'll force-feed you Keebler Elf cookies!"  Mike threatened.

"Huh?"

"So what?"

"WITHOUT the wonderful filling."

"AAAAH!!" Tom Shouted .

"NO! Not That! We'll be good..." said Crow.

"All right.  Now then, to clear things up -  Tom, why do you spend so much
time in the bathroom?"  Asked Mike.

"Well, to read the newspaper."

"What?? That's it?"

"Sure Mike. I thought it was obvious."  Tom looked at crow.  "Wouldn't you agree,
crow?"

"Yeah, that's why you go in there, isn't it mike?"  Crow inquired.

"Well, I do go in there to actually GO TO THE BATHROOM, guys."

"Oh.  Yeah."  Said tom.

"You and your flesh body and it's NEEDS.  Ha.  Hey, bathroom boy, the bad guys are calling."

Mike reached over and hit the flashing red button.

-DEEP 13

"Hello, mike; bots.  Crow, don't you think that "bad" is a little nice?  Dont you think
it should be EVIL?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"  said Dr. F.

-SoL

"No, not really."

-DEEP 13

"I'm insulted!  Well, time for today's invention exchange.  I'll go first.  I'm sure
that you know of the average headphones, don't you?  Well, these are really EVIL
headphones.  Instead of sending sound waves into your ears, it sends SHOCK waves into
your ears.  HAHAHAAHA.
Here on Frank, I have the first operational pair - of course he doesnt know, but this
is for science, right?"

-SoL

Mike looks up from his Tiger (tm) hand-held game and says "What?"

-DEEP 13

"Pay attention.  Okay.." Dr. F repeats what he just said.  "Now do you have it?"

-SoL

Mike says "yeah" as Crow walks by and says "Huh?  What did you just say, Dr. F?

-DEEP 13

"OOO!  That makes me MAD!" Now really red,  Dr. Forrester repeats it all AGAIN.

-SoL

Tom:  What?

-DEEP 13

"That's IT!  Forget You're invention!  I'm just gonna send you a real piece of crap - a
cross between "Men in Black" and "Tenchi Muyo".  enjoy!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

-SoL

"By the way, Tom, why is the Bathroom so dirty if all you're doing is reading?"  Asks mike.

"I get mad at some articles about the president and have to let my anger out."

"Oh No!  We've got fanfic sign!" Shouts Crow.

>It was a ship that did not exist.

TOM: Huh?

>It was, in fact, one of several thousand ships that did not exist.

TOM What?  Ahh!
-Tom's head started to crack-
MIKE: Calm down, Tom.  It's just that this doesn't make any sense, that's all.
TOM: Oh....all right...WAIT!

>Anyone who claimed that they did exist was usually visited quickly by people that
>don't exist

CROW: Like Elves? And Gremlins? And Eskimos?

>and shown the error of their ways.

MIKE: By brain-washing them and turning them into mindless zombies??? These
      must be horrible non-existent people!
CROW: Oh no, the author must be talking about the CIA!
TOM:  The CIA couldn't brainwash a watermelon, Crow.
CROW: Oh, right.  The FBI?
TOM:  No.
CROW: I know!  The Yugoslavian Special Police!!
MIKE: Exactly.
TOM:  This IS horrible.

>Aboard that non-existent ship,

TOM: ARG!  Stop making no sense!

>two figures uniformed in ebony

CROW:  They were encased in stone?

>sat in the bridge.  They were expecting a call.
>//Detective K, Detective M, come in...//

MIKE: The call was collect, so they didn't take it.

>"Detective K reporting, sir," said the one on the left.

CROW: (Caller) Detective K, where are you!?  You should've been back to eat dinner
     hours ago!

>//We've picked up a bio-energy signal, 28T in strength.

MIKE: 28 tons of life-energy?

>It's coming from the third planet of the Sol system.  We think it's a
>renegade class 7 artificial life form.//

TOM:  That's because it couldn't possibly be the 3 billion humans living on that
      planet.
CROW: The Yugoslavian Special Police aren't noted for their brightness, you know.
MIKE: The Yugoslavian Special Police aren't noted at all.
CROW: Same premise.

>"Space Pirate Ryoko?" asked K.

TOM:(Ryoko) What is it?

>"A real space  pirate?  Wooow!  I've never seen one of those
>before!"  chirped Detective M.

MIKE: Where did Detective M come from?
TOM: She must've woken up from nappie time.

>//It probably is Ryoko.  Go there and investigate.//
>
>"Right away sir."
>
>"Wai!  We're going to arrest a space pirate!"

TOM: No, were going to INVESTIGATE a space pirate.

>//One more thing.  This is a planet that hasn't had alien contact
>yet.  Be sure to clean up while you're down there.//

MIKE: They might be offended by how you two clean up your toilets.

>K sighed.  "Yes sir."

CROW: (K) I hate cleaning the bathroom.

>"Let's go!" cheered M.

TOM: She must be a cheerleader.

>She eagerly reached forward and whapped a
>few controls.

MIKE: She's a detective in some orginaztation -
CROW: The Yugoslavian Special Police.
MIKE: - and she can only "whap" the controls?

>"Space Pirate Ryoko, here we come!"
>
>K screamed in panic, "No!

TOM:(K) We're out of toiletries!

>Not the red button!"

TOM: Oh.

>"Ara?"

MIKE: Ara yourself, young lady.

>*BOOM*

CROW:(K) That makes a boom noise! Don't ever touch that!

> Protecting the solar system from the scum of the universe

TOM: I think "the solar system" is a bit broad.

>        Agent K                           Agent M
>
>               = Galaxy Police In Black =

TOM: The Galaxy Police don't wear black!  The wear blue and yellow
and black!
CROW: Fanboy.
TOM: Shut up.
MIKE: Hey! No disclaimer!
CROW: Cool! Now we can sue!
TOM: Happy days!  Maybe this hack of a writer will be removed of his
      computer.

>by rpm
>------------------------------------------------------------

MIKE: What kinda cheezy name is rpm?
CROW: It isn't as bad as, say, something stupid like Talarin.
TOM: Boy!  Talarin is the worst name I've ever heard!
MIKE: I wonder what it stands for.
TOM: Talarin?  Maybe "Talk And Laugh and Rock In Neo-woodstock".
CROW: Or "Tell All Living About Red Ink, Nelson".
MIKE: That doesn't make any sense, and I was talking about rpm.
TOM & CROW: OH!
CROW: Retarded Publication Maker
MIKE: Heh.
TOM: Really Pissed Muslim
MIKE What?
TOM: I don't know.

>Tenchi watched the sky, relaxing by the lake.

TOM: The sky was relaxing by the lake?
MIKE: It IS anime.
CROW: True.

>It was one of the few moments this day where his grandfather
>wasn't pushing him
>with one chore or another, or yet another sparring session.

MIKE: Also known as a "Get beaten up by Grandpa" session.

>He needed the break because too much was happening.  The demon in
>the cave WAS real.  HE released it.  And he hoped he sealed it
>back.

TOM: Whoa!  The entire first OVA episode zooms by in two sentences!
CROW: Fanboy.
TOM: The correct term is Otaku.
MIKE: Boy, Tom, you ARE a fanboy.
TOM: Quiet, you.

>Ah, well, no demons now.

MIKE: Just the vampires and ghosts.

>Just him, the grass, the lake,

MIKE: The vampires, the ghosts,

>and the clear blue...

TOM:  Windex?
MIKE: Triangle?
CROW: Brassier?
MIKE: Crow!
CROW: What?

>"Ano."

CROW: Clear blue Ano?  That doesn't make any sense at all.

>...not exactly clear blue...

TOM: So now it's a "Not exactly clear blue" ano. Ugh...
-Tom's head cracked again-

>"Uh oh."

ALL: SPAGHETTIOS!

>
>...big black ship barreling straight down from the sky.

MIKE: I guess "big black ship" doesn't classify as clear blue, so saying
"not exactly clear blue" was all right.

>"Grandfather!"
>
>Tenchi ran for his life back to the house, but didn't make it
>before the massive ship crashed into the lake.  This resulted in
>a giant splash that soaked everything within a 100 yard radius.

TOM: And, for some reason, didn't make a crater, and wasn't harmed in any way.

>*

TOM: WHOA!
MIKE: A bullet hole.
CROW: Is someone taking potshots at us?
-Crow looks around-

>This was certainly wasn't what Tenchi was expecting.

TOM: He was expecting to be ripped apart by the shock wave.

>Perhaps hideous monsters from outer space, or maybe an ace pilot
>that just crashed his top secret jet... but not two rather
>beautiful ladies joining them for tea.

CROW: What kind of tea?  Stupid author!  I need to know everything
      that's going on!

>"Sorry about the mess," apologized the one with green hair.

MIKE: (K) I didn't clean the bathroom yet.
TOM: It's more of a blue-green tint.
CROW: What?
TOM: Her hair.
CROW: Fanb- I mean, uh, Otaku.
TOM: Thanks.

>"Quite alright," said Youshou.  "You didn't do any real damage.
>Just scared the fish, I should think."

MIKE: SCARED the fish?  Try killing them all!

>"Who are you anyways?" asked Tenchi.

CROW: Sure, just ignore all the comma rules.

>"I mean, for a moment there
>I thought that was a UFO from outer space coming down on me."
>Tenchi laughed at the idea, as did his grandfather.
>
>The blond one seemed startled.
>
>"Um... gosh...

TOM:(M) I can't remember my line!
MIKE:(Director) psst! aliens, nonono...
TOM (M) oh, yeah.

>aliens!  Nonono!  What gave you that idea?"
>
>"Well, I dunno, I just didn't expect something crashing like
>that,"  replied Tenchi.  "What's your names?"

TOM: That English is horrible!  Tenchi just asked "What is your names?"
MIKE: Wait to notice every little thing, Tom.
TOM: Thanks.

>The green one smiled.  "Oh, we didn't introduce ourselves yet?
>How rude.  I'm R-"

MIKE: -ude.
TOM: -eally embarrassed.
CROW: -oger.  This is Hank.

>"I'm Mihoshi and this is my partner Kiyone!" said Mihoshi
>cheerfully.  "We're with the galaxy police!"
>
>"Galaxy... police?" asked Tenchi.

MIKE: (Kiyone) Actually we should be called Universe Police, since we protect from the scum of the
        "universe".

>Kiyone lunged for Mihoshi and grabbed her by the shirt.  "YOU
>IDIOT!  YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM THAT!"

CROW: Oh, Kiyone, don't give yourself away.

>"Wha?  Aaaah!  Oh no!"  She dug in her purse furiously and pulled
>an odd metal rod out.

CROW: Ooo...a "toy".
MIKE: CROW!  I can't believe you!
TOM: Yeah, Crow.  That was bad, even by your standards.
CROW: All right, all right, I'll be good.

>"Gotta use the neuralizer!"
>
>Kiyone yelled in alarm then immediately put on dark sunglasses.
>"No you idiot!  You're supposed to wear your sunglasses when-"
>
>*FWOOSH*

TOM: Whoa, wind gust.

>Too late.

MIKE: Who said that?

>Kiyone sat down, exasperated at her partner's incompetence.  Why?
>Why did she get assigned to this idiot?  She cursed fate, cursed
>her superiors, and gave Mihoshi a mild boot to the butt.

CROW: Bond-
MIKE: NOT another word. What did you just promise!
CROW: Sorry, I couldn't resist.
TOM: Come on Crow, that wasn't that much of an easy joke.
MIKE: You could've avoided that easily.
TOM: Stupid hentai.
CROW: Stupid otaku.
TOM: SHUTUP!
CROW: YOU SHUTUP!
MIKE: BOTH OF YOU STOP IT!

>"Ara?  What happened?" asked Mihoshi.
>
>"Idiot!  Moron!

TOM: Blockhead!
MIKE: Stupid!
CROW: Brain dead!
TOM: Jerk!
CROW: Square!
MIKE: Maniac!
TOM: Bozo!

>You zapped yourself with the neuralizer again!
>It's a wonder you don't have brain damage yet!"
>
>"Who are you?"

MIKE:(Kiyone) I'm Kiyone.  Nice to meet you.

>"AAAAARRGH!"

TOM:(Kiyone) We're still out of toiletries!
>
>- [one hour later...] -
>
>"So... I'm Mihoshi..." said Mihoshi.

CROW: It took one hour to teach Mihoshi her name?

>"That's right," said Kiyone.

MIKE: She just talked back to us!

>"And... I'm with the Galaxy Police..."

TOM: NO. You belong here. I hate you, remember now?

>"Mm-hm."

CROW: Which can also be said as "That's correct."

>"And they're not supposed to know about us," she said, pointing
>to a still-dazed Tenchi and Youshou.
>
>"That's correct."

CROW: Which can also be said as "Now you've got it."

>"And we're hunting after Space Pirate Ryoko?" asked Mihoshi.
>
>"Now you've got it."

CROW: Which can also be said as "Yup."

>"Oh.  Good."  Mihoshi looked at Tenchi and Youshou curiously.
>"These people aren't supposed to remember anything, right?"
>
>"Yup."

CROW: The opposite of Yup is "NO"

>"So we use this thingy here to-"
>
>"NO!"
>
>*FWOOSH*

MIKE: Hey, the Nike symbol.
TOM: Now he can be sued for something else!

>- [another hour later] -

TOM: The sun was a little bit closer to the horizon. That's it.

>"So we're supposed to be after the Space Pirate Ryoko?" asked
>Mihoshi.
>
>"That's correct," said Kiyone, through gritted teeth.  "Got it
>straight now?"

CROW: No, now the story is even more messed up.

>Tenchi and Youshou said nothing.

TOM: THERE ARE NO "U" 's IN YOSHO!

>Nobody bothered to give them
>anything new to remember, and they'd been neuralized twice in one
>day.  Brain damage, at least on a mild scale, was a distinct
>possibility.

MIKE: The author likes to talk about himself.
TOM: Apparently.
CROW: But I don't think his, ah, hanicap, is on a MILD scale.
>
>"Um, I have a question," said Mihoshi timidly.
>
>"What is it NOW?" growled Kiyone.

TOM: (Mihoshi) Where's the little girl's room?
CROW:(Kiyone) Can't use it.  We still haven't cleaned up.

>"Um... ara... Ryoko... does she have spikey blue hair?"
>
>"Yes."

TOM: It's CYAN hair!

>"And a tail?"

TOM: It's part of her belt!

>"Yes."
>
>"Ano..."
>
>"What?  Say it!"
>
>"I think she's over there," said Mihoshi, pointing to the
>doorway.

MIKE: Nope.  It's a doorway.

>Ryoko grinned.  "Yo.  Is there someone named 'Tenchi' around
>here?"

TOM: She attacked him at first!  She didn't ask if he was hanging around!  SHE ATTACKED HIM!
CROW:(Tenchi) Right here.  These two have been revealing all their
secrets for the past two hours.

>Kiyone gasped and backpeddled, reaching for her gun.

MIKE: She shot herself. THE END.
TOM: Feeling dark, Mike?

>Mihoshi reflexively grabbed the first thing in her purse and
>aimed....

CROW: Her wallet
MIKE: Her pager
TOM: Her Picture of Tenchi
>
>*FWOOSH*
>
>- [and yet a few more minutes later] -
>
>The girl wasn't sure what was happening.

MIKE: Now she's just like us!

>There was her, the girl that was dressed like her (in black) with
>blond hair, the girl with blue

TOM: IT'S CYAN!!!

>spikey hair, the boy, and the old
>man.  They were sitting in someone's house.
>
>"Ano... who are you people?" asked the blond.

CROW: They can still talk even though their memories are erased.
MIKE: Anime.

>"I... don't know," she replied.
>
>"I think... we were having tea," said the old man.

TOM: (Kiyone) I... don't know.

>"Seems like we were," said the boy.

TOM: (Kiyone) I told you, I don't know!

>The spikey-haired girl took a sip from her cup.  "Yeeesh.  This
>tea's cold!"

MIKE: (Ryoko) It was made minutes ago!

>"Oh, then I'll heat us up some more," said the elderly man.

>The green-haired girl in black frowned.  Something was wrong
>here.  She just couldn't figure out what.

MIKE:(Kiyone) I think it's that all our memories were erased...
TOM: IT'S BLUE-green!
CROW: Stop nit-picking, Mr. Otaku.
TOM: But it IS blue-green.

>"Oh!" said the blond one, picking up something chrome and
>cylindrical. "What's this?  It's got a red bit at the tip
>here..."

MIKE: Don't say ANYTHING, Crow!
CROW: What?

>*FWOOSH*

MIKE: Boy, it's windy up here in space.

>-the end?-

TOM: We can only hope.

"Well, how did you like it?" asked Dr. Forrester.

SoL

"Easy."
"Synch."

P.S.  Sorry to those of you who are sure of what otaku means.  I think I used it right.
Making this was a little easier than I expected.  Anyway, remember to mail me C&C, flames included, at

talarin@xoommail.com

P.P.S.  Sorry again, rpm, whoever you are.  It just needed doing.  You
should've had an email.  No offense; this isn't that bad of a fic. I
just don't like the MiB cross.
