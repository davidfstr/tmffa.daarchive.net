Trista:  Sorry bout this but it has to be done. We don't own any of the
Tenchi Muyo! characters they belong to Poneer, Wufei technicaly belongs to
Sunrise, though he sold himself to Joe at the last poker game, and Joe
Merchant belongs to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.

     Once again at fifty-one-fifty Altar rd. caffeine overrides basic
necessity as yet again a group of characters captured by the maniacal fanfic
writer, Jaiq da Goose, are screening one of Jaiq's lost fanfic adventures.

     Joe has brought together some of Jaiq's less loyal subjects to view his
shame.

Thread:  So what's this all about?
Joe:  The can says "Self Insertion attemp date 11/8/00".
Luna:  Three days after his first fic was posted, two days after her
captured
us.
Joe:  Yes, and if remember, he was kind of wierd the week after that.
Wufei:  Of course he was weird, he's always weird!
Trista:  Yeah, but he got weirder in the second week, that's when he started
his pursuit of the winged one. (points to Luna)
Joe:  It's also the week he learned that you need technitions to opperate
the
forth wall.
Luna:  So what happens in this, Joe?  How's this supposed to explain Jaiq's
weirdness anyway?
Joe:  I can't tell you, it's a surprise.
Thread(looking at can):  "Self Insertion", he's not going to do anything we
wouldn't do is he?
Wufei:  Like mixing egg nog and coffee?
Thread(looking sick):  Don't say "egg nog"!
(See "My.S.T. of MY WORST TENCHI FIC"--Trista)
Luna:  I think he means dishonorable things.
Joe:  Nope!  Not for lack of want, he just doesn't get a chance. (Joe turns
on projector)

>Jaiq:  OKay!  Survailance unit working.  Doc!  Is the forth wall open yet?
>Doc:  Almost!  Still plenty of time to get Washu or Howard to work this
damned >thing!
>Jaiq:  No Fucking Way!  I don't Washu guilt trippin' on how she don't want
me >anywhere near her daughter or Sasami.  I ain't no damn pedophile!
>Doc:  It's ready, I think.  (Aside to Joe) This is going to be bad.
>Joe:  What's worse is we're gonna end up doing all the work on this cause
he
>wants to keep it so quite.

>(screen goes fuzzy then opens in the ladies' bathroom)

>Mihoshi looks around and thought to herself, "How'd I get in here, oh well,
close >enough".

Trista:  You probably walked in Mihoshi.

>She looked around to see who else was there.  See could see all the other
girls.  >All of them! Nothing was hidden behind clothing.  Ayeka, Ryoko,
Kiyone, Washu, >Sasami, "where was Mihoshi?", she thought.

Thread:  Why is she asking that?
Joe(giggling):  I can't tell you that!

>Mihoshi leaned over and blew in Ayeka's ear, a little foreplay before
everyone else >leaves!

Wufei(holding the can):  This says 'self insertion', where is Jaiq?
Joe(giggling louder):  I can't tell you that!

>Ayeka turned to Mihoshi and said quite angrly, "MISS MIHOSHI, WHAT DO YOU
>THINK YOU ARE DOING"?!!

>"What?", Mihoshi gasped as she jumped naked out of the pool and dashed to
the >nearest mirror.  When she looked in the mirror she saw her shaply body,
her big >breasts, her bouncy light blonde hair, and her blue eyes with
yellow
around the >pupils, before she faints.

All look at Joe, who is laughing uncontrolably
Trista:  Tell me your kiding!
Luna:  I thought she looked weird.
Thread:  Mihoshi doesn't have pupils...Oh!
Wufei has joined Joe's hysterics

>A while later in Washu's lab, Mihoshi wakes up but can't move.  Washu leans
over >her with a small falshlight and shines it in her eyes.  "Alright,
she's
awake, she's >not hurt, there's no concussion!  So now will you all get out
of my lab!", she said >pushing everyone out the door.  Now that everyone was
out of the way, she could >ask what was realy on her mind.

Trista(as Washu):  So is it true what they write about you and Kiyone?
You're not the right girl for her.

>Mihoshi looked at Washu as she leaned over her again.  She'd seen thousands
of >different dimentions and hundreds of different Washus, why did this one
seem so >familiar?

>Then Washu started hinting as to why.  "Mihoshi, who are Doc and Joe"?

>"What do you mean"?

>"You said something about Doc and Joe getting it wrong".

>"Um, I don't know".

Luna(as Daria):  Can't accuse him of lying there.

>Washu grinned evily.  "You think you're so slick don't you?

Thread(as Jaiq/Mihoshi): Is that a trick question?

>"Your brain scan doesn't line up with Mihoshi's".

Wufei(as Washu):  It says you have one!
Joe(punches Wufei in the stomach):  Besides, that would eliminate Jaiq as
well.
Thread:  He's got a point.

>"In fifty-one-Fifty you hold all the cards, yuo don't even let me turn that
Thread jerk int a kappa!  But here in this dimemention, in my lab I am the
master"!

Trista: She knows to!  Sweet!
Joe:  I'll call it an accident, but only out of modesty.  VIVA la
RESISTANCE!
Thread:  What does she have againt me anyaway?
Luna:  Well for starters, You're an obnocsious Punk.

>Just then, a giant metal tentically machine decended from the ceiling.
Mihoshi started to squirm, realizing for the first time in his(remember it's
realy Jaiq--Trista) life that having boobs could be this painful.

(Luna and Trsta fold thier arms and wince)
Wufei:  What?  What's the matter?
(Luna dumps her hot coffee in Wufei's lap)
Joe:  Luna, the resistance needs solidarity.
Luna:  What's done is done.
(Wufei is hopping around the screening room screaming and fanning his pants)

>It took some creative wiggling, and a lot of hurt, but Mihoshi managed the
>imposible, she escaped Washu's lab.  When she leaned back against the door
in >the lab coat she stole from Washu, she soon felt she had gone from the
frying pan >and into the flame.

Thread:  I can't think of any thing worse than being trapped in Wash's lab.
Wufei:  You say that like you've been there before.
Thread:  She is our  chief technition.

>As Kiyone tarts screaming at her, "Mihoshi, we're supposed to be on patrol
in fifteen minutes!  What happend to your eyes, are you wearing contact
lenses"?

Trista:  Well at least he can't do any worse on patrol the she would.

>Mihoshi searched through the pockets of the lab coat, chancing upon a pair
of >reflective sunglasses.

Joe(adjusting his sunglasses):  Figured we'd give him a little break.

>She quickly put them on and said, "What do you mean, Kiyone"?

>"Nevermind, let's go!", with that Kiyone yanked her partnerthrough the
dimentional tunnel and in to thier apartment so they could change into thier
uniforms.  Mihoshi was to busy to watch Kiyone getting dressed.

Luna(english accent):  Always the gentalman, against her will.

>Or to notice that Kiyone was watching her.

Trista:  So this is where those freaks get thier ideas then right?
Joe:  No, not eveyone is on the interdimentional web.  Most of that is
immagination.
Wufei:  And what a dangerous nation.

>After changing and reaching the Yagami, Mihoshi and Kiyone found the same
old >boring solar system.  Mihoshi was steatched out for a long satisfieing
nap when >Kiyone burst into the cockpit wearing a cowboy hat, a babdana
around her neck, a >pair of chaps, and one of Washu's little strap on
naughties.  "Mihoshi, do you >know what time it i......."

(The projector stops and Joe winds forward through the fic)
Joe:  We don't need to see that.
Wufei and Thread:  YES WE DO!
Joe:  Dude, that's our boss, Jaiq!
Wufei and Thread:  Um, NEVERMIND!
Trista: Men!
Luna:  Not those two.

(joe reaches the point where he would have to give up on censorship for the
good of the cause)

>Mihoshi was on her hands and knees being ridden by Kiyone, when the pink
sheets under herturned into a blue light.

  Mihoshi found her self staring into the bearded face she once called her
own, with those vacant straight blue eyes.

>When Jaiq came to he was pissed.
>Jaiq:  What was that!
>Doc(trying not to laugh):  An accident, we told you we're nt technitions!
>Jaiq:  Noone is to see this you hear me! Noone!
>Joe(also trying not to laugh):  You got it!  Detective!
>(Joe and Doc are laughing there heads off jaiq is saying something as he is
>leaving, Joe turn into Lara Croft)
>Joe:  Dude, I think he's serious.

Trista:  Well, that's the way that evening went.  Jaiq would probably have
me
terminated if he knew I was writing this.  But as Joe said, VIVA LA
RESISTANCE.  Maybe with your help we can get this sick fuck off the
internet.
 I can take your responses at goose20693@aol.com, also I'll try to get a
regular version for easier My.S.T.ing.
Jaiq:  Trista, what are you doing?
Trista:  Sideline Fic.
Jaiq:  I didn't know we had one this time.
Trista:  Yeah, you told Joe to dig something up, so we slapped this together
and let you rest.
Jaiq:  How thoughtful. (he walks away)
Trista:Please help.
