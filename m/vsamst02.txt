Ventrra Science Academy
MST #2   An MST of "Euphoria"

Disclaimer: The characters of Rraxus Vis, Darrvon Dre, Pentrrekx Aleph,
and Charles Morgan belong to me (Charles Morgan). Everything else in
this fic belongs to Pioneer, Best Brains, or "Ryo-Ohki" (not the cabbit,
I hope).
______________________________________________________________
     A short time ago, in a failed comic book universe that was very near (to
the author), were three Ventrrans: Rraxus, Pentrrekx, and Darrvon. Oh,
and there was a terrible fanfic / MST writer named Charles....

     "What the...?" Charles starts, "Who the heck approved THAT intro?"
     "Well," Rraxus begins, "Since you blatantly swiped some other intro
last time, it was decided that you needed a new one. Besides, you'd only
get into more trouble if you used it again."
     "Hey! Wait a minute!" Charles sputtered, "I ended up getting Peter
Suzuki's OK for that one!"
     "It didn't end up on the web site."
     "I know." Charles said glumly, "My computer is a funny thing. It is
always trying to get me into SOME trouble or other. Besides, I sent a
retraction and replacement and apologized in a personal e-mail to Peter
for that happening."
     "The question is: What do you REALLY think about him?"
     "OK. For the record: Peter Suzuki is the most brilliant Tenchi Muyo 
fanfic and MST writer ever! And anyone who loves MST's or Tenchi
Muyo stories would be doing themselves a disservice for not reading
the things that he wrote! OK?" >_<
     "So the other writers don't know how to write?" Rraxus asked slyly,
"They're going to be very upset with you saying that you know." ^_^
     Charles smacks himself in the head. "No, there are LOTS of good 
writers there, I just....Never mind! I'll just end up getting into EVEN
MORE trouble!"

Later...

     The three Ventrrans are walking down a long hallway at the Ventrran
Science Academy.
Darrvon: So Rraxus, you really got under Charles' skin this morning.
Rraxus: Yup. 
Pentrrekx: How did you manage that?
Rraxus: There was a problem of the severest kind with the intro of our
last MST and I decided to remind him of it at the beginning of this one.
Darrvon: How did he like the opening that we provided?
Rraxus: Um.....(decides to evade) Look we're back at the theatre!
     The Ventrrans enter and notice entirely too late that Charles is already
sitting in the front row with an evil smile on his face.
*CLICK* The doors shut and lock behind them.
Charles: Bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Darrvon: Uh-oh.
Rraxus: Um..Charles...If this is about this morning...
Pentrrekx: What he means to say is: We hope you aren't mad.
Charles: ^_^ Oh, no. I'm not mad.
Darrvon: If you're not mad, then...
Charles: I'm well past that. I've got a new fanfic for you to watch. Bwa-ha-
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Pentrrekx: (Whispers to the other Ventrrans) Guys, this doesn't look good.
Rraxus: (Whispering back) I think we'd better humor him until this is over.
Darrvon: Good idea.
     The Ventrrans cautiously walk to their seats.
Charles: Today we have a "good" story boys and girls. Are you ready to
see it?
     The Ventrrans all nod as if they're trying to shake their heads off.
Charles: Good! (Then he pushes a START button)


>Euphoria - By Ryo-Ohki

Pentrekx: Cabbits can write?!


>Warning : this is a lemon fanfic, this means that it has

Rraxus: Lemons and lemon trees in it.

> adult content, throughout.

Rraxus: Darn.
Darrvon: So much for making lemonade.
  
> Even though I believe in the abolishment of censorship I don't believe that minors
> should not be reading this kind of material.

Charles: Which would be censoring it from them, no?

>  If you are under the legal age of your
>  country, district or state, please exit this site immediately.

Charles: Anyone fit that description here?
Rraxus: There aren't any of those things on our planet.
Charles: OK. Are you legal age for your planet?
Rraxus: Legal age for what?
Charles: To read a lemon fanfic!
Rraxus: You have to be a certain age to read about lemons?
Charles: No, it means...Never mind!

>Note : this is the sequel to my earlier story, "At the Carrot Patch", 

Pentrrekx: Wait a minute! Shouldn't we be MSTing that first?
Charles: You're not ready.

>so if you like this story, please read the other one(s) that I have written.

Darrvon: I don't want to.
Charles: Just you wait.

>  So far, I've only written

Rraxus: Bad stories.

>for the Tenchi series, but when I get enough information about others I will write
>about them too.

Darrvon: I'm feeling sorry for them already.
Charles: Hmm..I wonder if I could get him interested in writing some
Ventrran stories. ^_^
OTHERS: NO YOU DON'T!!!!
     The Ventrrans each produce a Warner Bros. like hammer and proceed 
to bash Charles over the head with it.
Charles: *Little birds go round and round...*

>Special Notice : If anyone is interested in working together on a story with
> me please contact  me at Mike_Forever@hotmail.com.  All other comments and >suggestions are welcome also.

      Charles recovers and reads the previous line.
Charles: (mumbling) Mike_Forever@hotmail.com
Rraxus: Do we have to hit you again?
Charles: I was just kidding!

>And now on to the story....

Darrvon: A long, long time ago....

>The day began as any other day,

Charles: Ryoko was in Tenchi's room naked.
OTHERS: Really?
Charles: Probably not..

> but today was no ordinary day for Ryouko.  She was 
>had a lot in store for Tenchi so that he would be hers forever.

Pentrrekx: Aw, how cute. She's going to make a little Tenchi doll.
     The others stare at Pentrrekx for a moment before returning to the fic.

>  She left the house shortly

Rraxus: Which was unusual since she was normally fairly tall.
Charles: That was lame.
 
>after lunch and told everyone that she wouldn't be back until late in the
> night.  Everyone naturally assumed that she had gone on a date with some
>other man after getting tired of pursuing Tenchi.

Darrvon: Oh, come on! This is Ryoko you're talking about! She only has two
interests: goofing off and Tenchi!
Rraxus: Even Aeka wouldn't be stupid enough to think that Ryoko would
just quit trying for Tenchi in favor of someone else.

>  Ayeka thought that she would take advantage of the situation by making
>a romantic dinner that would capture Tenchi's heart and make him notice her.

Pentrrekx: Sure. Poisoning Tenchi is a sure way to capture his heart.
Rraxus and Darrvon: Huh?
Charles: It was established in the series that Aeka isn't a very good cook.
     (Enter...THE LOGS)  *ZAAAAAAPPPP!*
Charles: *Oh, they fly upstairs in ones and pairs and make a zapping
sound...*

 > What nobody didn't know was that Ryouko hadn't actually left the house
> but was secretly sitting in the basement to wait for the right time.

Darrvon: (Nobody) No. Actually, I knew that.
 
>Ayeka cooked two separate dinners, one for Tenchi and herself

Pentrrekx: Which were normal.

> and one for everyone else.

Pentrrekx: With extra arsenic.

>Ayeka also set up another table in a separate room, away from everyone 
>else so they wouldn't be interrupted.

Charles: All right! A hint at a sex scene!
Pentrrekx: We're not going through THAT again are we?

>  Everyone came to the table sat down, and began the meal.  Ryouko turned 
>intangible

Rraxus: Although "inaudible" would have been good, too.

> so that she was now able to come up through the floor.  After poking her head
>through the floor she saw that neither Tenchi nor Ayeka were at the table 
>or Ayeka at the table anywhere.

Darrvon: Um...Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't it ALREADY say that
Aeka wasn't at the table?
Rraxus: Obviously the author thought it needed saying again.
Charles: "...she saw that neither Tenchi nor Ayeka were at the table or
Ayeka at the table anywhere." That doesn't make good grammatical
sense to me either.

>"That wench, Ayeka, she took MY Tenchi" exclaimed Ryouko "I hope
> she's not planning to take MY Tenchi away from me because he's MINE.
>  "If I find that she's with MY Tenchi I'll give her a beating that she'll
>never forget.  Maybe then she'll learn not to steal my man, ever again.  

Pentrrekx: (Ranting Ryoko) He's MINE, MINE! MINE I TELL YOU!
Charles: Calm down, Pentrrekx. You're overreacting.
Pentrrekx: (Katie Kaboom) I AM NOT OVERREACTING! I'M A
TEENAGER!

>Ryouko sunk back under the floor to continue her search for Tenchi.  

Rraxus: (Ryoko) I'm sure Tenchi is under this floor SOMEWHERE.

>The first place she check was the bedrooms

Charles: Maybe she even CHECKED the bedrooms.
Darrvon: You know. That's the first place I always check for people 
when it's mealtime. You never know when someone decided to
hide under the bed from their meal.

> but found that they weren't there, which greatly relieved Ryouko.

Darrvon: She was afraid that they WERE hiding from their meals?
Charles: No. She was afraid that they were having sex.
Darrvon: I thought that they already had a sex. Tenchi is male and
Aeka is female.
     Charles gives Darrvon a "Yeah. Right." stare.

>She finally found them in a dark, secluded room that was connected
>to Ayeka's bedroom that only Ayeka had access to, until now. 

Rraxus: So...she can become immaterial and float through floors,
but she can't access an otherwise normal room in the Masaki house?

>Ryouko came up through the floor, under the table and 
>crouched under it.

Pentrrekx: Charles? How tall would you say Ryoko is?
Charles: Probably around Five foot four inches or so. Why?
Pentrrekx: Then isn't that chabudai just a little bit too low for her to
be able to crouch under?
Charles: (Pulls out a few pictures of chabudai from other anime shows)
Looks to me like the tallest it's likely to be might be one foot.
Rraxus: (Ryoko) I'm shrinking, shrinking. What a world.

>She became solid again and was careful not to alert Ayeka of her presence.

Rraxus: So she bit her on the leg.
Pentrrekx: So she kicked her from under the table.
Darrvon: So she sprayed water on her.
Charles: (Timon) So she dressed in drag and did the Hula!
OTHERS: What? O_O
Charles: Nothing.

>Luckily Ayeka had used a long tablecloth that reached the floor so she
wouldn't be >interrupted from her plans.  

Darrvon: How long does that table cloth have to be? It's only a foot
or so from the floor to begin with.

>Slowly she knelt in front of Tenchi but didn't touch him yet, she had to 
>carefully plan this so that Tenchi wouldn't be too alarmed so that she
>wouldn't alert anyone of her position.

Pentrrekx: Because then the guards would start shooting at her.
Charles: Do you realize that Aeka DOES have guards?
Pentrrekx: Those logs that always come by and fry you?
Charles: (looks around suspiciously) Exactly.

>After much thoughtful planning she brought her plans up to Tenchi's lap

Rraxus: What part of Ryoko is supposed to be "her plans"?
Charles: (Xelloss) THAT is a secret. ^_^

>and lightly caressed the front of Tenchi's pants. 

Darrvon: (Ryoko) So. Is there a gun in your pants or are you happy to
see me?
Pentrrekx: You're becoming like Charles now?
Darrvon: (shocked) It just slipped! Honest!

>Tenchi looked up at Ayeka at turned a bright shade of red.
>"Oh Tenchi did I make your food too spicy for you?" inquired Ayeka

Charles: (Tenchi) No, Aeka. It's just that you seem to have taken cooking
lessons from Phyllis Diller.

>Tenchi shook his head and returned to his meal trying not to give anything
>else away.

Rraxus: Like his mind. Then he'd be poor indeed.
Charles: Like those cute little Ryo-Ohki dolls, like the one that I bought
from a place that...(the others stare at him) Um....Never mind.

>Ryouko paused for a moment to see if Tenchi had given away her position.

     The MST'ers make war movie noises.
 
>After a couple seconds she continued to caress Tenchi's slowly hardening 
>pole.  Soon Tenchi's dick was at full mast and bloated with blood. 

All: EEEEEWWWWWWWW!!!!!
Charles: "Bloated with blood"? Who wrote this? Edgar Alan Poe?

>His prick was becoming sore so Ryouko decided to undo his pants for him. 

Pentrrekx: Since she used her teeth, she took off more than she intended. ^_^
All the guys: OUCH!!!

>She was almost hit in the face as his full length came flying straight at
>her face.  

     All of the MST'ers leap behind their seats.
ALL: AIIIGGGHHH!!! She really did bite it off!!!

>Ryouko caught the bloated shaft at the base with her left hand and softly 
>started to run her fingers up and down his entire length. 

ALL: AAIIIIIIGGGHHHH!!!!!

>Tenchi tried hard not to moan, whimper or start breathing heavy

Charles: Or cry?
Darrvon: Or scream in severe pain?

> as it would give away what was going on and he definitely didn't want
>this to stop. 

Rraxus: Unlike those of us unfortunate enough to have read that last scene.

>The danger of the situation was very arousing for Tenchi. 

Pentrrekx: Having his manhood ripped off arouses him? (looks
meaningfully at the guys)
Guys: >_< Don't look at me! I don't know!

>In an effort to release the tension, Tenchi curled his toes upwards.
>He accidentally stuck his toe of his shoe into Ryouko's groin. 

Rraxus: So hard that she stopped her actions, hit him, and ended
this story.
OTHERS: HA!

>Ryouko was surprised at this and started to take her plan further.  

Rraxus: I STILL don't know what part of her her "plans" are.
Charles: (Xelloss) That is a...(gets interrupted)
OTHERS: Stop saying that!

>Ryouko once again turned intangible and sunk back trough the floor.

     Charles pulls out a dictionary. 
Charles: "Trough. n. Long, narrow, shallow container, usually holding food
or water for animals." Hmm... I think that must have been "through".
Darrvon: Either that or Ryoko is becoming an animal.

>"No, please don't leave me now, not when it was just getting good." 
>Tenchi thought to himself

Pentrrekx: Charles? Should that be just one sentence?
Charles: I haven't the foggiest idea.
Pentrrekx: You're the resident expert on Earth English.
Charles: I was a SCIENCE major in high school. I barely passed English.
Rraxus: And you're writing MST's now?
Charles: They're collectively called "Ventrra Science Academy" not
"Ventrra ENGLISH Academy". Sheesh.

>Once in the basement Ryouko stripped herself of all her clothing but
>hadn't yet become solid.

Darrvon: Something in that last sentence disturbs me.
Charles: (Obi Wan Kinobi) I feel a great disturbance in the force.
     Darrvon glares at Charles but decides to continue anyway.
Darrvon: Is it possible for an intangible person to strip off intangible
clothes?

>When she was totally naked, she returned to the underside of the table

Rraxus: At all of SIX inches high.

>and resumed her caresses on Tenchi's upright dick. 

Rraxus: (Mike Hammer) It's not easy to be a private dick in this city.

> Tenchi exhaled a sigh of relief and contentment, 

Pentrrekx: Because Ryoko had found "Mike Hammer" and stopped
bothering him.

>Ayeka congratulated herself on her meal as she thought Tenchi was
> merely enjoying the meal.  After Ryouko was sure that Tenchi was
>completely aroused, she slowly licked the underside of Tenchi's cockhead.

Charles: But the chicken really didn't like it, so he pecked at her and
forced her to let go. The End.
     The others stare at him.
Charles: What?
     They keep staring.
Charles: It's a bit of Earth humor, ok?

>Tenchi fought desperately

Darrvon: Only to discover that the war was over.

>to hold in his moans of pleasure.  
>Tenchi knew what Ryouko was thinking 

Rraxus:(Tenchi) The power of telepathy that Washu gave me are doing
wonders! ..... I think I can hear the ocean.

>and removed his shoe and sock off of his right foot.  He once
>again stuck his foot back into Ryouko's groin and started to massage
> her swollen clit with his big toe.

Pentrrekx: Thus giving her a quickly mutating fungus, which killed her
and ended the story.
Rraxus: (mumbling) ...and I thought the "bloated with blood" was bad...

>Ryouko pushed downward with all her weight and

Darrvon: ...broke Tenchi's leg in two places.

>forced Tenchi's toe into her love-canal.  Tenchi began to
>move his toe around within Ryouko's womanly depths.  
>Ryouko began to suck wildly on Tenchi's throbbing 
>cock

Charles: Making the chicken really angry.
     The MSTers stare at him again.
Charles: I didn't say ANYTHING.

> as Tenchi's half-kicked his foot upwards in an effort to get more
> of his toe inside Ryouko.

Pentrrekx: Thus bashing her head against the table and knocking her
unconscious and ending the story.

> Ryouko swirled her tongue around the head as a way of thanking 
>Tenchi. 

Rraxus: (Ryoko) Thank you for bashing my head against the table.
Charles: (Tenchi) No. Thank YOU for letting me.
Rraxus: (Ryoko) No. Thank YOU for....
Pentrrekx and Darrvon: SHUT UP ALREADY!

> She moved her hips up and down in the same
>rhythm as Tenchi's upward strokes. 

Pentrrekx: Wisely nullifying any effect that it would otherwise have.

>Ryouko bobbed her head down everytime that Tenchi's foot came up and 
>pushed down with her cunt lips in an effort to swallow Tenchi's toe.

Pentrrekx: Which would have succeeded if it weren't for those sharp teeth
being there.
     Charles suddenly pulls his feet up under him in his seat.

>Meanwhile everyone had finished their dinner and had gone about
> their regular activities.  

Charles: (Washu) I'm the greatest scientific genius in the universe.
Rraxus: (Mihoshi) Waaaaahhhhh!
Darrvon: (Ryo-Ohki) Meow. Meeooow!
Pentrrekx: (Sasami) What's that you say Ryo-Ohki? Timmy fell
down a well and can't get out?

>Washuu was in her lab.  Sasami and Ryo-ohki were off playing outside
>as they always do.  But, Ayeka was eating as slowly
>as possible in an effort to savor her time with Tenchi.

Charles: It was too late, though. Ryoko had already begun to "savor" him.

>"Why aren't you eating your dinner Tenchi?"  Ayeka asked inquisitively,
>"Don't you like the meal that I made for you?"

Rraxus: (Tenchi) I like my food WITHOUT cyanide, thanks.

>Tenchi scooped up some of what was on his plate with his fork and 
>swallowed it. 

Darrvon: Not realizing that a giant roach had been scurrying across it.
Charles: I can't believe you just said that. Yuck.

> He followed it up with a weak smile to make dissipate Ayeka's suspicions.

Darrvon: And because it's hard to smile when you realize that you
have just eaten a live roach.
OTHERS: EEEEWWWWWWW!!!!

>It didn't work however, as she was beginning to suspect
>something was wrong.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) Why did Lord Tenchi just eat a bug from his plate?

>"Oh, yes!!!  Here it comes,

Darrvon: The Chattanooga Choo-Choo?
Rraxus: ...to save the day? Like Mighty Mouse?

> I'm gonna cum straight down Ryouko's sweet throat" thought Tenchi. 

Darrvon: That wasn't what I wanted to hear.
Rraxus: No Mighty Mouse?

> He put everything he had into bringing Ryouko over the edge

Charles: And sending all of us OVER the edge.

>of orgasm also.  Tenchi increased his pace without making it obvious.

Pentrrekx: Bash. Bash. Bash. Bash.
Darrvon: (Aeka) Lord Tenchi? What IS that noise?
Pentrrekx: (Tenchi) Oh, I don't know. It couldn't be me icreasing
my pace under this (very short) table.

>Under the table, Ryouko's head was bobbing madly up and down on
>Tenchi's fully aroused prick.  

Rraxus: How does an injury get aroused?
Charles: Wha..?
Rraxus: You know. As in "If you prick us, do we not bleed?".

>Tenchi brought his hands down to his lap and placed them on the
>back of Ryouko's head.  He brought Ryouko's head down faster and
>harder on his dick.  He felt  the head of his cock hitting Ryouko's the
>back of Ryouko's throat. 

Pentrrekx: Causing her to choke and die. The End.

>Finally Ryouko rammed her lips down to the base of Tenchi's hard cock

Charles: ...........
Rraxus: No chicken joke?
Charles: I was just thinking about how sharp Ryoko's teeth are.
Rraxus: What about it?
Charles: (grimacing) What if she sneezed?

>and savored the flavor of Tenchi's sweet jizz. 

Darrvon: (Ryoko) Tastes just like chicken!
OTHERS: NOT!!!!

> At the same time, Tenchi kicked his foot up and lifted Ryouko up off the 
>floor with one foot 

Pentrrekx: And the resulting lifting of the table really aroused Aeka's
suspicions.
Darrvon: (Aeka) Lord Tenchi, why are you lifting the table?
Charles: (Tenchi) Oh..heh...It isn't because I'm lifting Ryoko off of
the floor with my foot!

>and jammed his foot as deep as he could into Ryouko's dripping cunt.
>She tightened her lips around Tenchi's huge dick 

Pentrrekx: And with her teeth as well...
     All of the males wince.

>and barely managed to keep all of his cum in her mouth, without

Rraxus: ...barfing.

>spilling any of it. Ryouko let it sit for a while and then swallowed
> it slowly so she could feel it slipping down into her throat and into
> her stomach.

Darrvon: That feeling then made her want to puke.
Charles: ....too late...*BARF*
Darrvon: (sweatdrop) It's a good thing the floors are self-cleaning.

>Ryouko put Tenchi's sock and shoe back on, then sunk back into
>the basement where she got herself dressed again.  She then teleported
> herself outside and acted as if she had just arrived home from the perfect
>date with the perfect man.

Pentrrekx: Because that would look just PERFECT!
Darrvon: I think you're PERFECTly right about that.

>After cleaning up all the dishes from dinner, Ayeka turned her attention
>to Tenchi.

Rraxus: (Aeka) Ok, Attention, I want you to face Lord Tenchi.

>"Are you alright, Tenchi?"  inquired Ayeka "You were acting very strangely
>during dinner and I think you might be coming down with something."  She 
>put her hand to Tenchi's forehead, but felt nothing strange.

Charles: (Tenchi) It was nothing, Aeka. Certainly not Ryoko under the table!

>"Maybe you're feeling lonely because Ryouko  left you tonight.  Well you 
>can forget about that slut,

Pentrrekx: (Tenchi) But what about the one in front of me?
    Half a dozen small logs appear and fry Pentrrekx.
Pentrrekx: (as ashes) *....ouch....*

>because I'm the one that really loves you.  Forget about that slut, 
>she left for her own personal needs without a second thought."

Charles: Gee. Do you think that Aeka thinks that Ryoko is a SLUT?

>Ayeka closed her door and then turned around and gave Tenchi a lust
>filled gaze.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) Here, Tenchi. Have a nice, new, lust filled gaze.
I assembled it myself.
Charles: (Gaze) I don't want to go to Tenchi. I want to stay at home and
bake cookies with you.
Darrvon: (Aeka) No, no, Gaze. You MUST go with Lord Tenchi.
Rraxus: Knock it off!

>She began to bring herself closer to Tenchi's body and pressed herself 
>softly against him. 

Charles: (Tenchi) Aeka? Is that kimono that you're wearing made out
of sandpaper by any chance?

>She rubbed the tips of her tits against Tenchi's chest until her nipples
>became fully erect and were visible through her kimono. 

Charles: Oh! I see. TENCHI is wearing the sandpaper.

>Tenchi couldn't help but look down Ayeka's kimono as he hugged her 
>close to him.  His dick raised up and poked Ayeka in the stomach.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) Tenchi, what a big dick you have!
Charles: (Tenchi) All the better to investigate you with my dear.

>"Oh, Tenchi!" exclaimed Ayeka "are you getting turned on due to
>my actions?"

Rraxus: (Tenchi) Actually, I just stuck my finger into a light socket.

>This wasn't one of the  questions that she was going to let Tenchi answer.

Darrvon: (Aeka) Don't answer that or I WILL have to hurt you.

> Ayeka reached out and 

Charles: ...touched someone.
Rraxus: ....touched the tip of E.T.'s finger.
Darrvon: ....pushed the off button of this fic.
Pentrrekx: ...grabbed a knife and killed Tenchi!

>began to slowly stroke the front of Tenchi's slacks with her right hand.
>With her left hand Ayeka reached for Tenchi's zipper and brought it 
>down slowly so that it made a long buzzing sound. 

Rraxus: BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
Darrvon: Wait! Did the zipper buzz or Aeka's hand?

>Tenchi brought both of his hands to Ayeka's shoulders and slid her
>kimono down off of her shoulders. 

Charles: Which was kind of weird since it was only wrapped around
her waist.

> Tenchi found that Ayeka had planned all of this by the fact that she
> wore no bra and was completely bare under her kimono. 

Pentrrekx: So on Earth, women can be completely bare while WEARING
a bra?

>Tenchi let the top half of Ayeka's kimono hang down and brought
>his hands

Rraxus: ...to a swift demise.

>to Ayeka's fleshy breasts.

Rraxus: Same difference.

>He gently kneaded the flesh that was Ayeka's tits.  He started around

Darrvon: ...the bend at the beginning of this story and hasn't been back
in character since.

>the soft edges and worked his way in towards her erect nipples that stood
>out a full half-inch from the rest of her tit. 

Charles: Which just goes to show how truly different Juraian biology
is from Earthling biology.

>Ayeka began to moan audibly as the sensations ran from her nipples
>from her nipples 

Pentrrekx: ...broken record....broken record..

>to her sensitive clitoris.  Tenchi took each nipple between a thumb
>and a finger and began to rub it back and forth between them. 
> He leaned forward and took one into his mouth, 

Darrvon: Thumb, finger, or nipple?

>Tenchi ran a lap around the sensitive nipple

Rraxus: Aeka's nipples are THAT big?

>with his tongue.

Rraxus: Oh.

>Then he took the fully erect nipple between his teeth and began to nibble on
it slightly, while nibbling he kept licking the tip with the end of his tongue.

Charles: (Aeka) Tenchi, didn't you just eat? It is not necessary to chew me.

>Ayeka slipped Tenchi's full cock out through the fly in Tenchi's pants.

Pentrrekx: So she takes a bird and pushes it through an insect that is
crawling around in Tenchi's pants?

>It stood out a full eight inches from his hips. 

Charles: In this story that's about how far it is from his brain, too.

>Ayeka was mesmerized by its length and width that she never knew possible.

Darrvon: (Possible) Hello, Aeka.
Rraxus: (Aeka) I don't know you.

> She kneeled down on the ground in front of Tenchi and pulled him
>down onto her mattress with her. 

Charles: Which I'm sure he liked more than being pushed onto the floor.

>Tenchi lay down on the bed to see what she was going to do. 

Pentrrekx: Hey, Tenchi! Ever hear of Lorena Bobbit?

>Ayeka was at his feet, kneeling at the edge of the bed.  She undid the
>button on his pants and pulled them off his muscular legs, and gracefully
>threw them into a corner of the room. 

Charles: (raising an eyebrow at Pentrrekx) Is it actually possible for a 
female to throw something GRACEFULLY into a corner?
Pentrrekx: I don't know. ... I never have.

>Tenchi took of his shirt and threw it into another corner of the room.

Rraxus: Obviously not gracefully.

>Ayeka crawled forward so that she had her soft lips positioned
>above Tenchi's upright dick.  She licked all around the tip, 
>lubricating it with her saliva. 

Darrvon: So, basically, she spit on him.

>She bobbed her head down all the way to the base a couple of 
>times so that the entire thing was lubricated up.  Ayeka stood up
>on her knees

Rraxus: How does one stand on one's own knees? Can humans bend
their legs that far?
Charles: I think that the author meant that she put her knees
under her.
Rraxus: Unless I'm on my back, my knees are always under me.
Charles: That's not...Never mind.

>and walked forward until she was directly above Tenchi's cock. 

Charles: She scared the chicken away.
Darrvon: I KNEW that you were going to say that.
Charles: I knew that you knew that I was going to say that.
Darrvon: I knew that you knew that I knew ... (gets interrupted)
OTHERS: Knock it off, you two!

>Tenchi placed his hands upon her hips and 
>looked deep into her eyes. 

Pentrrekx: (Tenchi) Look deep into my eyes...You are getting sleepy..
OTHERS: Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

>He could tell that she wanted him badly because her womanly moisture was
 >dripping down

Darrvon: So now she peed on him.

>and lubing his dick even more.  They both smiled at each other which
 >signaled that they were both ready. 

Pentrrekx:(Aeka, smiling) I am ready to get out of this lemon fic.
Charles: (Tenchi, smiling) I am also ready to get out.

>Tenchi forced Ayeka's hips down as she dropped all of her weight
 >downwards. 

Rraxus: Which would have been much harder if she'd been trying to
stand up, instead.

>Tenchi's huge prick drove deep into Ayeka's
>warm depths.  Tenchi pulled down until Ayeka's pussy
>lips had come all the way down to the very base of his manhood.
>He held Ayeka down so that they could both enjoy the pleasure
>of their first sexual experience together. 

Charles: Which would seem to imply that they've had a few apart.

>Tenchi pushed up on Ayeka's hips, her cunt made a delightful
>squishing sound as Tenchi penetrated her pussy. 

Pentrrekx: It sounded like someone walking through mud to me.

>He stuffed himself into her inch by inch.

Pentrrekx: (Aeka) ...but Tenchi, your whole body will not fit inside
of me.

>Once he had totally buried his meat inside his lover's hole,

Darrvon:(Tenchi) Turkey, chicken, ham, fish....

>he brought her back up so that just the head of his dick was
>left inside her, 

Pentrrekx: ...because the rest was chopped off.
OTHERS: OW!

>slowly brought her back down to the very base of his dick.

Pentrrekx: Which was made easier by the lack of a middle.
GUYS: >_< STOP ALREADY!
Pentrrekx: Hee-hee-hee-hee.

>Oh! Dearest Tenchi, you feel so good inside me.  Pump you dick into me 
>harder, faster,

Rraxus: stronger, better. Gentlemen, we have the technology.

>oh yes!!  Doesn't this make you feel better after that wench,
>Ryouko, left you for another man?

Charles:(Tenchi) Um....no?

>Ayeka began to raise and lower herself on Tenchi's cock faster
>and faster until they both

Pentrrekx: ...burst into flames.

>had gotten into a pounding rhythm.  Tenchi looked up and saw Ayeka's tits
> flopping up and down in front of his face.  He couldn't
>resist, so he reached up with both hands and grabbed them. 

Rraxus: Right out of the air where they were floating around.

>He pinched both nipples and began rolling them between
>his fingers.

Pentrrekx: News flash! Nipples don't roll.

> He leaned forward and buried his face between Ayeka's beautiful,
>round tits.  Tenchi rubbed his face up and down between her tits, 
>trying to get more of that wonderful, musky odor into his nostrils.

Charles: Which I'm sure she wouldn't have had if only she'd remembered
to put on some deodorant that morning.
OTHERS: YUK.

>Tenchi licked the flesh between the fleshy mounds. 

Rraxus: He missed Aeka entirely...

>He pressed both of her pert breasts together close enough so her 
>could get both nipples in his mouth at the same time. 

Darrvon: "So HER could get.."? Tenchi's a girl now?
Charles: From what I understand, Tenchi IS traditionally a girl's name.


>Tenchi bit them 

ALL: O_o THAT WOULD HURT!

>gently between his front teeth to keep them in his
>mouth, at the same time he tugged on them slightly. 
>He began to flick his tongue across the both of her nipples.
>Ayeka moaned out loud and continued to pound herself on to 
>Tenchi's slick meat.

Pentrrekx: Well, I'M not going to eat any chicken or ham or...

>"Damn, your cunt is so tight Ayeka!" Tenchi managed to moan

Charles: (Tenchi) Which is weird. I saw the biggest dildo ever
underneath your pillow!

>Tenchi grabbed either side of his lovers' hips to slow her down
>as they both approached orgasm.

Darrvon:(Tenchi) We'll slow down now. We're approaching orgasm.
Pentrrekx:(Aeka) Orgasm? I knew I should have taken that left turn
at Albuquerque.

>Finally Tenchi rammed his cock as far as it would go into
>Ayeka's warm depths as he shot his searing load of jizz up into
>her womb.

Rraxus: He set his balls on fire to achieve that?

>Her cunt muscles contracted in an effort to milk the cum out 
>of his balls.

Pentrrekx: Although, grabbing them and squeezing as hard as she 
Could, might have worked, too.
GUYS: NO! NO WAY!!!!

>"Thank you Tenchi, you have proven to me how much you love me.

Charles: Actually, all that he proved was that he liked screwing her.

>Now Ryouko can't take you away from me, ever!

Rraxus: Since he didn't protest Ryoko's actions earlier and went on
to have sex with you, I doubt your assertion very much.

>You belong to me now.

Pentrrekx: (Ranting Aeka) He's MINE, MINE! MINE I TELL YOU!
Charles: Calm down, Pentrrekx. You're overreacting.
Pentrrekx: (Katie Kaboom) I AM NOT OVERREACTING! I'M A
TEENAGER!

>But for now you must rest.  From the way you were acting earlier
>on in the evening, I'd say you were sick. 


Darrvon: Oh, he's sick all right...

>I'll be back to check on you later, to see that you are alright."

Charles:(Tenchi) OK. Tell Ryoko that for me so she can come up here
and...Did I say that out loud? D'oh!

Rraxus: What's with all the stars?

>Well, that's all I have this time around.

ALL: THANK YOU!

>If I can get enough ideas for a part 3 I'll do it.

Darrvon: I'm sure that we could suggest something else.

>If not I'll try doing another series.

the Ventrrans: NOT OURS!

>Stay tuned and feel free to send your comments and/ or ideas to
>Mike_Forever@hotmail.com.

The doors to the theatre open and the MSTers get ready to leave.

Charles: What are your thoughts this time?
Pentrrekx: That wasn't as bad as you had made it out to be.
Rraxus: Same here.
Darrvon: A lot of the details were messed up, but it wasn't 
really, REALLY awful
Charles: Eventually we might get around to his first effort, then
you might think a bit differently. But for this one...well, I'm still
trying to get you warmed up a bit. Right now I haven't gotten any
feedback from anyone, so...(shrugs).

several people have MST'd the first story that he wrote. And
unlike the first story that I MST'd, THIS person had the guts
to put his e-mail in it at least. (In my book, that gets him
a couple of points.)
