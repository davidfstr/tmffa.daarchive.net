When the Carrot Bites Back!

        It's been one of those days around the Masaki house.  Ayeka and Ryoko
are once again ready to trash the living room, while everyone else heads
for their designated shelters.

        Sasami jumps for the kitchen with Ryo-Ohki.

        Washu goes for her lab.

        Noboyuki and Tenchi dive for the front door.

        Misa runs for the bath and slams the door, accompanied by Ryo and Riko.

        And, then it happens.  Like clockwork, the living room explodes.

        As everyone walks back in, they see the usual outcome.  Both of them
are now unconcious.

        "So, when's lunch?" Washu asks.

        Ryo-Ohki is so used to this that she fell asleep halfway through the
ordeal.  As she's napping, she purs softly.

        Sasami, still cooking, "how could anyone sleep through that?"  <She's
so cute when she purs like that.>

        Ryo-Ohki is dreaming her usual dream.  The world is covered in carrots.
Big ones, little ones, and bigger ones.  While chewing on the carrot,
she looks at it curiously.  <Since when did carrots sprout?>

        "Hey!  That's me you're chewing on!"

        Ryo-Ohki drops it and jumps back a foot.  Slowly, she creeps back over
to the would be snack.  "Meow?"

        "That's right," the carrot says.  "Be careful what you eat.  Otherwise,
it might eat you!"  Jumping forward, "How about I chew on you?"  The
thing jumps forward and snaps at the cabbit's foot.

        "Miya!" Ryo-Ohki shouts, backing up.

        "And, I'm not alone!"  Having said this, other carrots from the
world-wide pile start to stand up.  "We're not going to take it
ANYMORE!" the first one shouts, leading the pack.

        Ryo-Ohki turns and runs away.  But, looking back, sees many of the
terror snacks pursuing her.  One of them manages to jump forward and
latch on to her ear.  Another bites into her tail.

        Then, a miracle happens, and she snaps awake.  Jumping to her feet, she
bears her teeth, only to realize where she is.  Calming herself, she
hops up to the counter.

        "Oh, you're awake," Sasami says, cheerful as always.  Pulling out
something from a basket, "carrot?"

        Ryo-Ohki just looks at it, wide-eyed, and bolts for the living room,
nearly tripping Tenchi.  She finally stops underneath the sofa.  She
then peers her head out towards the kitchen.

        <It was only a dream.  It was only a dream.  It was only a dream.  It
was only a dream.> Ryo-Ohki thinks to herself.  Finally, she walks
cautiously back into the kitchen.  Looking at the orange vegetable, she
examines it closely.

        "It's not going to bite you, Ryo-Ohki," Sasami says.

        Ryo-Ohki just looks up at her, <wanna bet?>  But, finally she starts on
the snack.  <It was only a dream.>
