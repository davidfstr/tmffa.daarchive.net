Ahhhh, it's good to be back.
Where the hell have I been, you ask?  The War on Terrorism leaves little room 
for Tenchi fanfic writing, I'm afraid, especially for someone in my profession.  
Plus I have been cursed with the game "Dark Age of Camelot", which takes up most 
of my free time.  But here I am, determined to leave no challenge unanswered and 
no story unfinished!  A while back Mr. Diabolo (a.k.a Jetset now) challenged me 
to sonfic-a-fy "In The End", by Linkin Park, so here it is after MUCH delay.  
Enjoy!

"In The End of Tenchi Muyo"

(open with static radio sounds and piano)

It starts with...
One thing, I don't why,
It doesn't even matter how hard I tried,
Keep that in mind as I fly away,
I'll explain in due time
Why I left.

Time is a valuable thing,
I just fooled around with your emotions in swing,
Thought it last forever at the end of the day,
But she stole your heart away,
I just can't deal.

Didn't watch out, you know?
Watched the time go right out the window,
Tried to hold you but I didn't even know,
Wasted my time now I have to cry...

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart,
What you meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time

I tried so hard
To win your heart
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Now you and her
Are arm in arm
And in the end
I never even mattered.

One thing, I don't know why,
It doesn't even matter how hard I tried,
I'll keep you in mind 'till the end of time
To remind myself how I 
Tried
So 
Hard
Even though I knew you weren't mocking me,
That I still was a part of the family,
Remembering all the times she fought with me,
I'm surprised we
Got 
So 
Far
Things can't be the way they were before,
I can't even fake a smile to you anymore,
Not that I was faking back then
But the pain comes back to me
In 
The
End

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart,
What you meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time

I tried so hard
To win your heart
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Now you and her
Are arm in arm
And in the end
I never even mattered.

(softly)
I put my love in you
Loved as far as I could go
And for all this
There's only one thing you should know...

(screaming)
I PUT MY LOVE IN YOU
LOVED AS FAR AS I COULD GO
AND FOR ALL THIS
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW...

I tried so hard
To win your heart
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
Now you and her
Are arm in arm
And in the end
I never even mattered.

(fade out to piano and static)




End notes:  I leave it to you to insert the singing female of your choice, 
although I had one in particular in mind when I wrote it.  As always, it helps 
to have the song in mind or playing in the background while reading.

Adios!
