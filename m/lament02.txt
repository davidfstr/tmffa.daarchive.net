LAMENT FOR NOBUYUKI

I watch you, my darling
I still see you beyond the thin confines of your vision
Through the emptiness of years and he gap of time
I look for you still

I wonder about you, my darling
For the endless days and nights which wrap around me
Through the pain and sorrow we both endure 
I dream of you still

I hope for you, my darling
A hope which wanders foolishly but still unbreakably 
strong 
That one day we may forget and more on
I have faith in you still

I ache for you, my darling
For every second non-breathing non-eating non-sleeping 
I spend
Your touch- all of my time I spend as a spirit soul
I ache for you still

I long for you, my darling 
We were once together now apart separated not by thought 
but life
Not by word but body, not by feelings but by fact
I love you still

END

Awww...I think this might be even sweeter than
the last one. Please let me know what you guys think-
I am but a penniless wretch living in an air 
conditioned dustbin of Beachy Head...
Anyways-
