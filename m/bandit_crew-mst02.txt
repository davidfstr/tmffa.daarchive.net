Disclaimer:I do not own Tenchi Muyo,Pioneer and AIC do,Also I do not own Outlaw 
Star,someone else does.And I also dont own any of the other anime that might be 
in here,other people do.I want to thank the author of the fanfic even though I 
did not get permission to mst their fic,Im sure they wont mind.
The Bandit Crew are based on me and my moronic friends...

Prisoner roll call:
<Psyco!>Can you get blood stains out with club soda...
<Hunter!>Ohh Hentai...
<Demon!>Yo mama
<Syllia!>I Want Candy!
<Chris!>Ohh God...
<Jimmy>yeah Beavis were gonna score,hehe
As the kidnapped prison ship,The S.S Bandit floated through space,its crew was 
doing everything to keep what was left of their sanity.The group set in the 
recreation room,but in one of the cells there was a loud 
explosion.Chris,Psyco,Hunter J,and Syllia darted in there to see what had 
happened.There in the middle of the room,Demon was beating the crap out of 
Jimmy,who held in his hands an odd green glowing orb.
<Demon>Dammit Jimmy!Give me the glowy thing!
<Jimmy>(on the verge of tears)No Demon,Its mine!I stole it fair and square!
<Chris>Im betting on Demon...
<Hunter J>I thought you were a holy man Chris...
<Chris>Well we all sin sometime...
<Psyco>(cheering)Kick his ass Demon!
<Syllia>Please dont hurt him Demon...
<Jimmy>(coughing up blood)I..can...take..her..
Then as Demon was about to pound Jimmy's face in with a combat boot,she finally 
pryed the glowy thingy out of his hands,and left him convulsing on the floor.But 
then as she was going to slam it against a wall and bust it,Evil Uhsaw's voice 
boomed over the intercom.
<Uhsaw>Dammit Demon put the transfer orb down!
<Demon>(smiles evily and slams the orb against a wall,shattering it into a 
million peices)Oopps,hahahahaha
<Uhsaw>You idiot!You may have opened a wormhole to another world!
<Demon>And your point is?
<Psyco>Way to go Demon...
<Chris>Yeah thanks Demon,you really got him mad now...
Before anyone could say anything else,a bright flash covers the room and as it 
subsides,two figures appear.One of the figures is wearing a multi-colored 
kimono,and her black hair is put in a long pony tail on the back of her head.The 
second one is a young man with rusty red hair and at his side he holds a 
castor.Both of them have confused looks on thier faces.
<Chris>(with a quick bow)Hello,umm who are you?
<Young Man>Im Gene Starwind and this stern looking lady is Sazuka.
<Sazuka>They call me Twilight Sazuka.
<Uhsaw>(with a hint of sadness in his voice)Well since we will probably have two 
different guests every so often then I guess(sniffle)That two of the original 
cast can leave...
<Syllia>(raises her hand first)I want to go!
<Chris and Psyco>We want to go to!
<Uhsaw>Well Syllia you can leave but Psyco,Chris you two are going to have to 
flip for it... 
<Jimmy>(pulls out a coin with a naked picture of Ryoko imprinted on it)You can 
use this...
<Chris>(takes the coin and gets a nose bleed)Umm Psyco,Heads or Tails?
<Psyco>Heads...
<Chris>(Flips the coin,then looks at it with a smile on his face)I win...
<Psyco>(Mumbles something and walks to a corner)
<Uhsaw>(crying)Okay you two guys just stand on the transfer platform...
<Syllia and Chris>(does what he says to)
<Uhsaw>(presses a big button in his office,and the two dissapear)
<Hunter>Uhsaw where did you send them?
<Uhsaw>A molded planet called Earth..
The rest of the crew are about to say something,but the fan fic sign flashes.
<Uhsaw>Fanfic Alert get your sorry cans in the theater or else!
<Jimmy>Or else what?
<Uhsaw>Ever heard of 'At the Carrot Patch'?
<Everyone exdcept for Gene and Sazuka>(shudder at the thought)Okay were going!
As the crew high tails it into the theater,Sazuka and Gene,with looks of utter 
confusement on their faces,reluctanly follow and sit down.
<Sazuka>(taps Demon on the shoulder)What is a fan fic alert?
<Demon>Well since this is a prison ship,we have to be forced to watch the 
crappeist fics that Uhsaw can find or we will 'die'(mumbles)yeah like that will 
happen...
<Jimmy>Demon you seem awfully calm today
<Demon>(hands him a bag of liquid morphine)
<Psyco>Is that what I think it is?
<Gene>(who is zoned out too)Yeah its the miracle drug...
<Everyone but Gene and Demon>(face faults)
Then the lights in the theater start to dim and Uhsaw's ugly mug appears on the 
screen.
<Uhsaw>Todays little peice of Hell is intitled 'Little Ryoki'
Then as his face dissapears off screen,Jimmy pulls out an Uhsaw voodoo doll.
As he is sticking pins in it,a paragraph appears on screen.
<Gene>I have a bad feeling about this...

	Little Ryoki
Disclaimer:I don't own all these characters,but I own Ryoki.
I dont mean the little cabbit.REG.Flare its about something I made,when
Ryoko's daughter comes  from the future.

<Jimmy>Me no understand disclaimer...
<Gene>(pulls out a porn with Melfina on the cover and shows it to Jimmy)Do you 
understand this?
<Jimmy>(takes the magazine and whistles and is joined by Psyco and Hunter)Hell 
yeah!
<Sazuka and Demon>men...

	Tenchi was walking around the lake,when something fell into it.Then it 
burst out and stood on the water,like Ryoko.He saw that it was a littler version 
of Ryoko."Hi!"the little Ryoko said."Waa-who are you?"Tenchi said back."I'm 
Ryoki,Ryoko's daughter from the future."She said,and then she disappeared.
<Sazuka>This is unquestionably stupid...
<Hunter>(farts,burps and scratches his ass)
<Sazuka>(puts her bokken to Hunters neck)I have killed men for less you pig!
<Gene>Hey Sazu,ill give you twenty woolong to 'kill'me..hahaha
<Demon>You cant I have your money(waves his wallet in the air)
<Gene>(pulls out his castor)Give it back or die...::crunch::
Genes eyes fill with tears as he sees a big chunk dissapear from his gun,then he 
looks over to Jimmy who is munching on the metal.

 "Ohh great,now we have two trouble makers."Tenchi muttered to himself and ran 
to the house.He saw Ryoki talking to Ryoko,explaining 
something."Hi,Tenchi!"Ryoko said giggling.

<Demon>(as Ryoko)Look Tenchi its Mini me!
<Jimmy>Ohh yes,Jenny lets not forget to bring Austin Powers into this...
<Psyco>Hahaha your real names Jenny..hehe
<Demon>yes it is..James..hahahaha
<everyone except for Demon and Psyco>(laugh)
<Uhsaw>(whos voice booms over the intercom)Hhahaha Jenny,James...ahahhaah
<Psyco>Shutup..Josh..hahaha
<everyone>(gets quit then burst out laughing)
<Uhsaw>No more making fun of names,Now watch the fan fic or you will have 
latrine duty!
<Everyone>(shuts up)

Ayeka walked to the top of the stairs and gasped.Ryoki said,"Who are you?"."A-
Ayeka."She said,shaken."Oh yeah,I'm Ryoko's daughter from the future,and my 
name's Ryoki."Ryoki said,falling off the stairs,but disappearing before she hit 
the bottom.Sasami came in,saying that breakfast was ready.Mihoshi heard and came 
down.

<Demon>(in a very realistic Mihoshi voice)Whats for breakfast Sasami?
<Hunter>(exactly like Sasami)Your favorite Mihoshi!Human Flesh!
<Demon>(Still as Mihoshi)Wow yummy!I havnt ate anything human since that time at 
Kiyone's!
<Psyco>(clamps a hand over Demon's mouth)Now thats enough of that!
<Hunter>(as if he is possesed by Pretty Sammy)Pretty Hunter!Possums and Spam in 
a glove,I will make everyone in this room feel friendship and love!
<Sazuka>I think its time for a break!
With that the screen goes blank and everyone high tails it out of the 
theater,with Magical Girl Pretty Hunter J following them.In all of the 
chaos,Demon,Psyco and Gene run into the dungeon of the ship,while Sazuka and 
Jimmy try to lead Hunter into Uhsaw's room.
<Gene>What is that thing?
<Demon>That my friend is a broken little man...
<Psyco>Yeah and hes got my Sailor Moon costume on...	
<Demon>Did you just say that you owned that costume?
<Psyco>Did you say that you wanted my body?
<Demon>Hell no!
<Psyco>Well then...case closed.
<Gene>I think I was safer with the Sailor Retard out there...
Meanwhile in Uhsaw's room,Magical Girl Pretty Hunter J has Sazuka and Jimmy in a 
corner,waving a plunger with glitter on it at them.
<Hunter>I will make you love each other!
<Sazuka>(pulls out her bokken and tries to strike him with it)Die spawn of 
satan!
<Hunter>(Knocks the bokken out of her hands and shoves the plunger in her face)I 
will make you love!
<Jimmy>(slips away and runs,screaming like a little girl,out of the door leaving 
Sazuka to her fate)
As Jimmy joins the rest of the crew,Sazuka's cries to God can be heard.
<Gene>(kicks Jimmy in the balls)Your a coward!
<Psyco>Yeah you prick!You could have got some assasin ass!
<Demon>(chanting something in latin)
All of a sudden Uhsaw's voice comes over the intercom.
<Uhsaw>Everyone get your sorry behinds into the theater!
<Gene>What about Sazuka and Hunter J?
<Uhsaw>Well Sazuka is well kind of umm dead...I found her with a plunger through 
her skull so I threw her body into space,and I thought that Hunter was with you?
<Gene>(crying)
<Demon>(with big puppy dog eyes)Uhsaw,he thinks hes Pretty Sammy and he might be 
in the theater...were scared...
<Uhsaw>Ohh please...if hes in the theater you can plug up the night light so 
that the big ol boogie man wont get you..
<Psyco>But hes real...
<Uhsaw>Yeah and im the easter bunny,GET YOUR ASSES IN THAT THEATER NOW!!!!
With that everyone slowly walks back into the theater,thier heads hung down so 
that noone sees them crying.As they sit down,the fan fic starts again.

Everyone got into the kitchen to find that Ryoki and Ryo-ohki were playing.

<Jimmy>With themselves...
<Demon>(crying)Shut up man,he can hear us..

"oh!Sorry,I forgot about breakfast when Ryo-ohki came in."Ryoki said,and she and 
Ryo-ohki walked outside.As they sat down,Tenchi noticed that Ryoki was talking 
to Ryo-ohki,and ryo-ohki was talking to her as well.After breakfast,Ayeka,for 
some reason,ran to Ryoki,and asked her,"Who is your father?"."Um,he said to not 
tell anyone until they noticed I'm not all like Ryoko."Ryoki answered."I know 
that,you did'nt destroy my ship!"Ayeka said,getting angry."No,but I destroyed a 
bit off your planet.It was a dare!"Ryoki said."YOU WHAT?!?!?"Ayeka screamed at 
her,but Ryoki dissapeared.

		
	****************************************************************
<Demon>Ohh great,im seeing stars...
<Gene>(Looking to the back of the theater,where singing can be heard)Hes 
evil,Hunter's playing with our minds.....
<Psyco>Its probably that crack you've been smokeing...
<Jimmy>Yeah ive seen evil and its not Pretty Sammy...
<Demon>(mumbles)If you saw evil,you would have to change your pants...

In the evening,Ryoki started whispering to Ryoko,making them both laugh.Ayeka 
heard them laughing and walked to the stairs.

<Psyco>Where she fell to her death,the end...
<Demon>Hear!Hear!
<Gene>No look its not over!Hahahahahahahaha!(Pulls out his castor and blows his 
brains out)
<Demon>Yuck!I got outlaw on my shoe!
<Jimmy>(Kicks Gene's dead body under his seat)Heheh keeping THAT for safe 
keeping...
<Demon>Ohh dear god!Now I hear the singing...

Ryoki and Ryoko were laughing hard."I realize you not all like Ryoko."ayeka said 
to Ryoki.

<Demon>I did not understand that at all
<Jimmy>Yeah if I had half a mind...
<Psyco>Then youd be gifted...
<Someone in the back of the theater>Love,love,love!!!!

Ryoki and Ryoko stopped laughing."Tell me who your father is."Ayeka 
asked."Heehee,little-princess-of-Juari,My father is the little-prince-of-
Juari."Ryoki said,and she and Ryoko started laughing again.Ayeka screamed.

<Demon>(as Hunter jumps over some seats and into her lap,wearing the sailor moon 
outfit)Get it off!
<Hunter>(puts the plunger to her face)Love?
<Demon>(gets an idea and whispers into his ear)Be a good boy and..Ill let you 
take that outfit off of me tonight...
<Hunter>(chants something and appears in his normal garb,then sits down beside 
Psyco and Jimmy,who are scared out of thier tiny minds)
<Jimmy>hehehehehe pineapple...
<Psyco>What tha fuck...

Tenchi came down stairs."What's happening?"He asked."She said,that her father 
was you!"Ayeka said."Yeah,Little-prince-of-Jauri."Ryoko said.Ryoki starting 
running outside,be chased by Ayeka,be chased by Ryoko,who is screaming,"Leave 
Ryoki alone!",being chased by Tenchi.

<Psyco>Does this fan fic seem to have been written by a young kid to you guys?
<Demon>(Laughing and pointing to the screen as if she is enjoying the fic)Ohh 
look at em go!
<Jimmy>Either a little kid or someone with Demon's brain capacity...
<Demon>Capacity?brain?what meaning of big words?

Then a gap in the sky made them stop."Well,I'll come back.Bye Ryoko,bye 
Tenchi,bye Ayeka,bye Ryo-ohki,bye Sasami,Bye Mihoshi!"Ryoki said.

<Hunter>Why is she telling Ayeka goodbye when Ayeka was just about to ring her 
neck?
<Psyco>I do not...know..

"Bye Ryoki.'Every one said as Ryoki flipped into the gap.

		END
<Jimmy>(rubbing his eyes)Its over,Free at last,free at last,thank God we are 
free at last...
<Psyco>Again with the qoutes eh Jimmy?
<Demon>I dont give a fuck if he qoutes Princess Fatora,lets just get out of 
here!
With that the Bandit crew get up and as they are leaving the theater,Jimmy drags 
Gene's dead body from where he had hid it.In the recreation room...

<Uhsaw>So how did you like it?
<Demon>(Flips off his disembodied image)Go fuck a goat!
<Uhsaw>I knew you would like it,and guess what?
<Everyone>What?
<Uhsaw>Do you remember Bob the fanfic operater?
<Hunter>Yeah what ever happened to him?
<Uhsaw>I killed him,but thats not the point,you now have a new,more sinister 
fanfic operater...

With that a young man in preacher gab walks into the room.

<Everyone,excluding Uhsaw and Chris>But your supposed ta...
<Chris>Yeah I know,be on Earth,but I missed you guys..
<Uhsaw>Yes very well,Chris I will beam you up to Bob's old room..
