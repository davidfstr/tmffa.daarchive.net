One for the kids, no sex or cursing. Credit to for original fic.

"Author's note:Since we are MSTing a Tenchi fic and the Tenchi cast
are MSTing The<> sign are the MST characters.

In the very distant future where demons run amok,
There was a man, Tenchi Masaki, who was a real shmuck.
Forced to read fics by doctor clay,
Who has a stupid beard that's really gay,
So he threw his curlers in a purse, and persued him in a
Rocket across the universe.
I'll send him crappy fanfics,
The worst I can find
"la la la"
He'll have to sit and read them all to torture his puny mind
"la la la"
Keep in mind he can't control when the fics will be sent
He'll try to keep his sanity with the help of his horny friends
Stalker roll call!!
Ryoko:But they don't taste like apples.
Washu:The internet is my doing!
Kiyone:Could I have ¥50 for the bus, Noboyuki?
Sasami:Chimpokomon is super toy number 1!
Ryo-ohki:MEOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
If you are wondering how they eat or breathe, or other science facts,
Repeat to yourself it's just a fic and you really should relax,
For Tenchi-Muyo theater 4000
TTTTTTTTTTWWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG
(Inside Starship Ryo-Ohki)

<Washu>My computers have detected a strange presence aboard Ryo-Ohki.
<Ryoko>Yeah, that's nice. Uh-oh. I did it again, I just remembered.
<Washu>What?
<Ryoko>Remember the time when I wished Tenchi a big Johnson?
<Washu>Yeah.
<Ryoko>well, I did that again the other day...
<Washu>Why did you do that? I thought you said it, um worked the first time?
<Ryoko>Well, it wore off after awhile.
<Washu>Oh no. Who knows what can be lurking around this starship now.

Truth or Dare 2

By: Sword_Master

Disclaimer: I don't know anything here except Sword_Master, Author's
Hideout,
Death_Witch, and Holy_Kyle.

A/N: Geez! When I wrote the first one, I didn't expect such a big outcome! I
guess I should continue, eh? Still looking for a repair foreman. And for the
people that didn't get what Ayeka was wearing, it was a skimpy Mrs. Clause
outfit she was wearing (I would LOVE to get a picture of THAT =). I though
the nosebleed from Tenchi would have given it away. Also, you will start to
see me (Sword_Master) get ready for the SI fic I will soon be writing. I
will
be looking for suggestions for that fic (and it won't be a humor, at the
start anyway) once I get started with it.

At Author's Hideout (Note: You can skip this if you want to, but it really
doesn't matter)

Sword_Master: Hey Holy_Kyle, is my gun ready?

Holy_Kyle: Yeah, here try it.

<Tenchi>It's yummy!

Sword_Master puts his sights on the target, pulls the trigger, and sees a
huge hole where the target once stood.

Sword_Master: Um, I won't need the gun this powerful…

<Keone>Wait. He wants his gun to be *less* powerful? Is this some sort of
sick joke?
<Tenchi>Well, I'm still trying to figure out out why a guy named
sword_master is obscessed with guns.
<Ryoko>Swords and guns are interchangable for purposes of psychological
penis symbolism, silly.

Holy_Kyle: Oh. Here, this should fix it. ^tweaks at the power adjustor^

Sword_Master: Cool. ^fires at another target^ Perfect, this is what I need.

<Tenchi>Does this mean that he wants a smaller wang or something?
<Keone>Um, you may be reading more into this than there is. I mean,
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
<Ryoko>Oh, come on. Sword *Master*?
<Keone>Ok, you have a point.

Just then we see Dea
th_Witch come storming into the room.

<Keone>Death-wich? Is that like a Chip-wich?

Death_Witch: YOU MADE HER WEAR THAT!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! ^falls over
from
laughing so hard^

Holy_Kyle: Hehehe. I know, but why that? You could have made her look really
stupid.

Sword_Master: I know, but I just had to do that! I mean, Ayeka and that
costume equals one hell of a funny situation!

<Tenchi>(Cartman)Yeah that would be hella funny, ya guys.
<Keone>(Kyle)Dude!

Death_Witch: Hurry up and write the next part! ^pull out Sword_Master's
laptop^

<Ryoko>Ok, so now it's a *laptop*.
<Tenchi>Just because you can't get your mind off of that doesn't mean that
everyone else. . . oh, just forget it.
<Ryoko>I just call them like I see them.

Sword_Master: Ok. You don't have to push…

<Keone>I don't believe how dirty you two suddenly made that line become.
<Ryoko>At least the actual fic is starting now. What was that weird self
insertion thing all about?
<Tenchi>Beats me, but I think we'll miss Sword_Master, Holy_Kyle, and
Death_Witch's wacky antics very soon.

At the Masaki household, Ayeka and Ryoko finally agreed to trade in each
others pictures to one another. Too bad for Ryoko that Sasami, Washu, and
Mihoshi all had a picture of Ryoko in the Barney costume.

<Ryoko>Well, it's not like anyone can tell it's me in there.
<Tenchi>You'd be a terrible Barney. Really.
<Ryoko>Hm, let me try.
<Ryoko>I hate you, you hate me,
I just triggered World War III,
With a big bright flash death comes falling from the skies
Now it's time to vaporize.
<Tenchi>I rest my case.
<Keone>Your morbidity never ceases to stagger me.
<Ryoko>We please to aim.
::The Three exit the theatre.::

<Washu>Guess what guys? LBJ is here again and he brought some friends.
<Tenchi>What!?! ::sweatdrops::
<LBJ>I came back with my crew, we're the three letter presidents!
<FDR>Yeah baby.
<JFK>Er, groovin.
<Ryoko>Um, why are you here?
<LBJ>That's easy. To protect the world from devastation!
<FDR>To unite all peoples within our nation!
<JFK>To denounce the- hey wait, that's is pokemon.
<FDR>You've been confusing tv with reality again.
<LBJ>Oh, yeah. What is that pokemon thing anyway? Back home, we collected
steak.
I had all one kinds.
<FDR>Well, when I was a kid, we collected zingie-dings. . .
<JFK>Shut up, FDR.
<FDR>Why don't you shut up instead you stupid kid.
<JFK>Bite me, mr grumpy guts.
<FDR>That's president grumpy guts!
<LBJ>Come on guys, don't fight! ::starts crying::
<JFK>Ok, ok.
<Sasami>Um, shouldn't you guys be, um, appearing in George W Bush's dreams
or something?
<LBJ>Hey that's a great idea! But we'll be back. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
<FDR>Yeah, why should that Lincoln guy have all the fun?
<JFK>Ha ha, we'll plague his brain with disturbance and confusion.
::They disappear.::
<Washu>The question is, will anyone be able to tell the difference?
<Sasami>Never mind! We have fanfiction sign!
::Kiyone, Tenchi, and Ryoko re-enter the theatre.::

Ayeka: Can we take off these stupid clothes now?

<Tenchi>That really didn't sound right.
<Ryoko>I think she just meant change the clothes.
<Tenchi>Yeah, but still.
<Keone>Take it off! Take it off!
<Ryoko>Um. . . . never mind.

Mihoshi: We didn't give you a time limit, so I guess you can.

Ayeka went into another room to change. Ryoko knew that there were other
pictures of her floating around. She wasn't going to leave without them. It
was easy to get them to hand over the pictures. Even Washu compromised with
ease.

Ryoko: ^Thinking^ This is too good to be true! I actually got all of the
pictures back! I guess they were scared of me. ^goes off into another room
to
change^

Sasami: ^whispering to Washu^ Did you get the pictures scanned on your
computer?

Washu: ^whispering to Sasami^ Of course

<Tenchi>(aol)You Got Ryoko!
<Ryoko>I got banned from aol.
<Keone>Why?
<Ryoko>Something about kidnapping Steve Case and making him smell dirty
socks for hours.
<Keone>Oh.

Ayeka and Ryoko return after changing. It was Ayeka's turn.

Ayeka: ^thinking^ Who should be the next person to perform a stupid task.
Ah,
Lord Tenchi should so it. Now we will find out who he really likes. ^Out
loud^ Lord Tenchi, truth or dare.

Tenchi: ^thinking^ Oh-no, she is not going to get me to admit feelings for
anyone ^ out loud^ Dare!

<Keone>Double dare!
<Tenchi>Physical challenge!
<Ryoko>Wake me up when this is over. . .
<Keone>Zzzzzzzzzzz

Ayeka: ^thinking^ Drats! Oh, well. I still get to watch him do something
stupid. ^out loud^ Ok, I dare you to sing the "I am a little teapot" song in
front of everyone in your boxers!

<Ryoko>Stupid Ayeka, didn't she see that south park episode? The whole point
is to get them to say dare.
<Tenchi>Huh?
<Ryoko>I guess you didn't see that episode either.
<Tenchi>Oh.

Ryoko: Whoa! I didn't think you would have the guts to dare someone that.

<Keone>No no no, Guts is an entirely different nickelodeon show altogether
than Double Dare.
<Ryoko>. . . that hasn't been on the air since about 1997. . .
<Keone>Oops. Guess I havn't really been paying much attention. . .

Tenchi: Yikes! What is the alternative?

Ayeka: You have to watch 1 episode of our show in the American, dubbed,
Toonami verson!

Tenchi: I will take the teapot challenge! I will never watch the show in
that
form!

So, everyone gathered around as Tenchi sang I am a little teapot in his
boxers. Everyone got a kick out of it.

Ryoko: ^laughing like hell^ I never knew you could sing so well!

<Ryoko>Yeah, your interpertation of the sadness and melencholy expression of
"I'm a Little Teapot"
Is astonishing.

Tenchi looked outside, and it is still raining and harder then ever. Then he
got an idea. It was his turn and he needed to get someone who hasn't gone
yet. He scans the room.

Tenchi: ^Thinking^ Ok, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Sasami haven't gone yet. I think
seeing Kiyone wearing a pokemon outfit would loosen her up a bit! ^out loud^
Kiyone, truth or dare.

<Tenchi>(Kiyone)I'd like to buy a vowel.

Kiyone: Dare!

Tenchi: Ok, you can wear this (Holding up the same costume that Ayeka could
have worn, the pikachu one.)

Kiyone: No way! What is my other choice?

<Kiyone>You can take American History for 1,000.
<Ryoko>Daily Double!

Tenchi: You have to be nice to Mihoshi for 1 hour.

Kiyone: That's easy.

Sasami: Yeah, and your really nice to Mihoshi, like a flying brick is nice
to
a duck that got hit by it.

<Ryoko>Last time I tryed, I couldn't hit a single duck by throwing bricks.
<Tenchi>That might be because bricks are heavy, sluggish, and slow.

Tenchi: ^thinking^ I know that damned author is behind this. I am just going
to have to kill him one of these days so these damned fics stop being made…

<Ryoko>Hm. I guess that's that then.

At Author's Hideout…

Death_Witch: Why did you stop, it was getting good!

<Kiyone>Compared to. . . .

Sword_Master: Because I felt like stopping. Besides, I have to finish this
damned armor before the SI fic starts.

<Ryoko>Yeah, the SI fic where I'm basically the god of the world as usual.

Holy_Kyle: Why don't we make sure the SI machine works?

Sword_Master ignored the comment and went to the bar.

<Tenchi>And became a lawyer.

Heero_YuyZ: What do you want?

Sword_Master: Just a Sprite.

Heero_YuyZ: 1 Sprite coming up.

<Ryoko>Heero hands him Puck from Midsummer Night's Dream. "Here you go"

Sword_Master grabs his can of Sprite and is looking at the T.V. when
Holy_Kyle just grabs him for no reason.

Sword_Master: What are you doing?

<Kiyone>Sorry, I've been so lonely lately.

Holy_Kyle: Testing out the SI machine…

Sword_Master: ^sigh^ I guess there is no use fighting. ^To readers^ I know,
this chapter was kind of stupid, but I have no ideas! So, as sort of a
tradition, I am being thrown in the third part of the series (did anyone
notice that?) to fix something. Maybe this time it won't be so bad, if
Tenchi
doesn't kill me. Comments? Flames? Ideas? Send them to
kylegarlow@hotmail.com
. Please send me the ideas and not putting them on the message board. Later.

<Tenchi>Later.
