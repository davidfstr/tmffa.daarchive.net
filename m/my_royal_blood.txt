My Royal Blood

The Crowned Prince of Jurai, the legendary knight of the Universe,
And the holder of the most powerful Juraian sword -
Ten-chi Ken, could not reverse
The ruling of God. Father still keeps his words
To make me the successor of the blood-stained throne
Of Jurai, and of the Universe, while he knows there
Are prejudice against his own
Son. I love my father and Jurai, but where
will I stand in front of Jurains if I choose
To become their emperor? I escaped, fought,
And tried to eliminate this dilemma, whereas fate left me no choice. 
Fate had pushed me to sever all ties with my family when I fought
Ryoko, the Demon, for the sake of my freedom.
O! Freedom! You are so precious that I had to give up, for you, my kingdom!
