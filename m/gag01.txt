     Detroit.  The Eastside.  A building.  The sign over the Door reads
Goose's Art Gallery (That's where we
got G.A.G).
     Inside there is a receptoin area with two desks.  The desk to your
right is a drawing
desk,  accross the top are various women of videogames and comic books
molded from
plastic.  Sitting at this desk is a young man with a blond pony explosion
and a green hooded sweatshirt.
     The desk to your left is a normal office desk, accross the front are
pictures of  different rock stars, and a
sign reading "Activities Manager".  Behind this Desk Is a short woman with
pointy ears, white & black hair, and a pair of bat like wings growing from
her wrists.  She is wearing a Steve Yzerman jersey.
     Passed the desks is a couch.  Sitting on the couch is a Dark haired man
wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and a pair
of mirrored sunglasses, and a red haired female marine (PFC).
     The man on the couch yawns and lays down accross the sofa.  Then the
Jar-head cracks him in the head
with her side arm (AB-10 machine pistol).

Arlene:     GOD DAMN IT FABIAN!  I said stay on your side!
Charlie:     Very mature, Sarge.
Alene:     Private FIRST Class.
Charlie:     Kiss MY Ass.
Luna:     Goose are you done over there yet?
Goose <looking at a comic book>:     Oh Yeah, Go for it Remy! <Turns the
Page> Crap.
Luna:     If he tries to fuck her it'll kill him.  Are you ready yet?
Goose:     Yeah, let's go.

     Luna gets up and turns the sign from open to closed.  Then this group
walks into a room marked
EMPLOYEES OLNY.

Luna:     I thought you were going to fix that?
Goose:     I'll get to it.

     Since it may be important to someone:  the seating order.  Left arm,
Luna, left cussion, Goose, middle
cussion, Arlene, Right cussion, Charlie.

Arlene:     The Great White Hope?

Arlene:     Is it too late to go back to the alien demons?

Charlie:     Large, sizable, humongus, Charlie Fabian. . .
Arlene:     Would your ego be more comfortable in a bigger room?
Charlie:     Would you like to suck my ego?
Arlene:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with her AB-10>

Charlie:     So, what's that mean, Goose?
Goose:     I don't know.  <as Bruce Willis> I only speek two languages,
English and Bad Engilsh.

>Goose: That’s the wrong show! Just skip it.

Luna:     On Tenchi's Lap.
Arlene:     Luna, put the vibrator away.

Arlene:     You to, Fabian.

Goose:     Stop looking at me!
Arlene:     Just trying to see what a freak on a sugar rush looks like.

>Ayeka: Breathe Miss Wasyuu. Wasyuu: Okay so I was in my lab cyber-molesting
>Tenchi, then Bam!

Arlene <as Wasyuu>:     I hit my head on the toilet!

>Mihoshi: What happened?

Luna:  She said <as Wasyuu>  I hit my head on the toilet!

>Wasyuu: I started cyber-molesting Bam Margera, but that's not important.
>Then WHAMO! Ryouko: You started cyber-molesting a blow-up doll?

Arlene:     Jake, How exactly do you cyber-molest someone?
Goose:     The same way I cyber-molest Lara Croft.

>Wasyuu: No, all these alarms and bells and whistles and junk started going

Arlene:     Jake, what did she just say?
Goose:     She said a
holographic-hydro-pyrotechnic-atmospheric-geothermic-electromagnetic-
     dimensional-biological-centrifugal-fusional disturbance.
Arlene:     Ooookaaaaay.  Charlie, what did he say?
Charlie:     He said a
holographic-hydro-pyrotechnic-atmospheric-geothermic-electromagnetic-
     dimensional-biological-centrifugal-fusional disturbance.
Arlene:     Luna. . .   Nevermind.

>Noboyuki: Hydro-Pyrotechnic?

Charlie:     A little fire-water sounds good at this point.
Goose:     Would ya settle for a touch of Hooch?

>Wasyuu: Okay, so maybe I added a few, but it's super huge, and it's only
>246,000km from
>here. We got to go or I'll forget! Sasami: Yipee, pass the nachos.

Luna:     Sorry kid, Goose is hoggin' all the chips.
Goose:     Hey, how much of this did you pay for?

>Tenchi: All those in favor?

All:     Just give her the damn nochos!

>All: Igh. Tenchi: Those opposed? All: Igh. Tenchi: All right everybody in
>the Ryo-oh-ki. Katsuhito: Already there!

Goose<as Katsuhito>:     Cum on In!
Luna:     <Cracks Goose in the head>

>Sasami: But she's not a spaceship yet! Ryouko: GET THAT OUT OF THERE YOU
>FREAK!

Charlie:     For the Love of all things psycho-altering let the bunny go!
Luna:     She's not a bunny.
Charlie:     then let the cunt go, but turn her loose!

>Mihoshi: I'm gonna throw up!

Arlene:     I've seen some sick things, but I'm with her on this!

>Ayeka: AND PUT YOUR SHOE ON!

All - Goose:     <SQUEEEEEEAAAAAL!  CRASH!>_< >
Charlie:     Kinda brings new meaning to 'Put my foot up your ass'.

>     Minutes later on a sore but NOT sexually abused Ryo-oh-ki. . .

>Ryouko: So why are we taking my ship?

Luna:     Because it's CUTE!

>Mihoshi: Because mine is in the shop. Ryouko: And why are you here?

Chalie<as Mihoshi>:     Because your wrist is handcuffed to my ankle,
remember?

>Mihoshi: To make sure everything’s nice and legal. Ryouko: And why's Sasami
>here?

Goose<as Noboyuki>:     Because she's gotta learn sooner or later.

>Ayeka: Because we couldn't get Noboyuki to baby-sit her. Ryouko: And why is
>Noboyuki here?

Luna<as Noboyuki>:     Because if you girls get into trouble the anime` gods
will rip your shirts off!

>Noboyuki: Because I never get to go. Ryouko: And why is Katsuhito here?

Arlene<as Katsuhito>:     To get another go round with Ryo-oh-ki!  <as
Arlene>   Oh, my god!
     What did I just say!?!

>Katsuhito: Aren't I in the shrine office?

>     Shortly there after Ryo-oh-ki closed in on a humongous flying wing.
>Everyone was then teleported into a big (I'm running out of synonyms here)

Goose:     Gargantuan, bulhemouth, mamoth, My aunt Debbie!

>Ayeka: Okay Miss Wasyuu, we're here, now what? Wasyuu: Where are we?

Luna:     In a Massive room In a Giant flying wing.  Take some Riddlin.

>Ayeka: Were at the source of your goetechnic-hydroponic, um, thing.

Charlie:     The Hydroponic stuff is the best.  Next to the geneticly
engeneered stuff you get from
     the feds.

>Wasyuu: Okay, we can go now. Kagato: No you can't! Tenchi: What are you
>doing here?

Goose<as Kagato>:    Um, Wash your widows?
Luna<as Ryoko>:     What about Washu's Windows?

>Kagato: What do you mean 'what am I doing here?' What are you doing here?

Charlie<as Tenchi>:     Looking for a
holographic-hydro-pyrotechnic-atmospheric-geothermic-
     electromagnetic-dimensional-biological-centrifugal-fusional
disturbance.

>Tenchi: I killed you. Kagato: You did? Tenchi: Yup.

Goose<as Kagato>:     Bananas in your pockets make lousy stop watches!
Arlene:     What was that all about?
Goose:     I just thought that spot was begging for a line.  But that's all
I could think of.

>Kagato: You sure? Tenchi: Yup. Kagato: Okay, I'm out.

>     Kagato turned to leave, then turned and walked back.

>Kagato: I don't have to leave, they resurrected me!

All - Goose<in unison with Ayeka>:

>Ayeka: Who did? Kagato: They did!

>     Kagato pointed to Tsunami and Goose who were sitting in folding
>loungers on either side
>of a cooler full of beer.

Goose:     Fourth wall, What's that?

>                                         They waved to the crowd. Tenchi:
>Why did you bring him back?

Charlie:     That's a good question, why DID you bring him back?

>Goose: I know you're not asking a fanfic writer to rationalize their
>actions.

Luna:     Was that you or him?
Goose:     If you can't tell, why should I?
Arlene:     <Points her AB-10 at Goose>
Goose:     Him.

>Tenchi: Not you, Her!

Luna:     <Points Arlene's AB-10 at Goose>

>Tsunami: I brought you back, didn't I?

Charlie:     I didn't ACTUALY die!
Arlene:     What's he talking about?
Goose:     Read the book.  You can read, can't you?

>Ryouko: But . . . but . . . but . . . Tsunami: A motorboat!

Luna:     No, Goose's car!
Goose:     My $215 wonder sure gets you around, don't it?

>Goose: Enough of this! Kagato, Kill him! Kagato: Yes, Master! Ryouko:
>Master?

>     Kagato drew his weapon and slashed and stabbed furiously at Tenchi
>with it.

>Ditch: Now for some appropriate background music

Luna<singing>:     Somewhere the time was right/ Could've been gone in ten/
This world is hard
to fight/ Hitting you once, hit it again.
Arlene<singing>:     Cut my life into pieces/ This is My last resort!
Charlie:     Ladies, have you forgotten who we're talkin' 'bout here?
<singing> Annie's 12 years old/
In Two more she'll be a whore/ Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way/
Don't be afraid/ With
the quickness you get laid/ For your family get paid its the wrong way!

>I took her out, it was a Friday night I wore cologne, to get the feeling
>right We started making out, and she took off my pants But then I turned on
>the T.V.

Luna & Arlene:  <In unison with Goose in the fic>

>Goose: THAT's appropriate background music?
>Ditch: You’re in the Fic now, you can't tell me what to do.

Charlie<singing>:     The only family that she's ever had/ Is her seven
horny brothers and her
drunk ass dad.  .  .
Goose:     You can stop singing now.
Charlie:     You're assuming I want to.

>Kagato: DIE BITCHES, BASTARDS, RATS, PETS! THIS PUPPY'S LUCKY I AIN’T BLAST
>HIS ASS YET!

Arlene:     Ladies and. . . um, you two, Intergalactic Rap sensation, Kagato

>Kagato's Weapon: *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* Sasami:
>You've got to be kidding. Tsunami: Ahahahahahahahahahahaha!

Luna:     WAIT!  Aren't they the same person?

>Tenchi: Enough of this.

Arlene:     HWUH!  Jake, You're one psycho son of a bitch.
Goose:     Everyone who sent in feedback loved it.
Luna:     THAT WAS ONE PERSON!

>     Tenchi took out his 'sword'

Arlene:     YOU SICK FRAGGIN' PERVERT!!

>                                                       and attacked Kagato
>with equal fury. With each slash of Tenchi's 'sword' a bright flash
>engulfed Kagato then dimmed.

Charlie:     Well, as this fic goes, he was pretty dim to begin with.

>Katsuhito: Oh, I barrowed your flashlight.

Goose:     Cut to the shrine fuse box.  Which has been reduced to a smoking
mess of wires and
shredded metal.  Now who's the pervert?

>     Kagato turned and ran away.

>Tenchi: Good riddance.

Goose<singing>:     Another turning point a fork stuck in the road/ Time
grabs you by the wrist
directs you where to go.

>Tsunami and Goose: Go get him! Tenchi: Do I have to? Goose: I won't be your
>friend!

Arlene:     STOP DOING THAT!
>Goose:     Doing what?
Arlene:      <Cracks Goose In the head with her AB-10>

>Tenchi: You weren't my friend to begin with! Tsunami and Goose: GO!

>     Tenchi grunted and ran in the direction Kagato went and came to a set
>of three doors.
>He listened to the first door and heard the unmistakable sound of a riding
>crop striking the skin.

>Yugi: ON YOUR KNEES WORM!

Charlie:     Under age girls and S&M.  This sound dangerously like a Tank
Kop Fic.
Goose:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with a pricing gun>  You will not use
that word in this building

>     He tried the second . . .

>Amagasaki: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Ken Kaniff: Oh fuck yeah!

Goose:     ThankyousirmayIhaveanother?

>     Suffering from a lack of choices, he chanced the third door.

Charlie:     He ran into Goose cyber-molesting Lara Croft!
Arlene:     <Cracks Charlie in the head with her AB-10>
Charlie:     <Craks Arlene in the head with his sawed-off double barrel
shotgun>  That's enough of that.

>
>                                     On the other side he found
>himself in a huge hangar.

>Tenchi: And what are you doing here? Tenchi: Sorry, got ahead of myself.

Luna:     TWO Tenchis?
Goose:     Chuck, trade seats with me.
Charlie:     I ain't sittin' in that.

>Heero: You're never gonna catch him on foot, take my Wing Zero.

Arlene<as Dr. J>:     Zero system tells you your enemy's moves.
Luna<as Wufei>:     It brings you friends.
Charlie<as Trowa>:     It brings memories back.
Goose<as Dr. J>:     It loosens up your tense shoulder and imporves food's
falvor.

>Noin: I never got to fly the Wing Zero.

Luna<as Wufei>:     That's Because Women Are Week!
Arlene:     <Cracks Luna in the head with her AB-10>  That's something I'd
expect from Fabian.
Charlie:     That's something I really wanted to say, A-cup.
Goose:     Watch where you're swinging that thing.

>Heero: Go munch Releena's rug.

>     So NOW Tenchi's in space in Wing Zero and he found . . .

>Tenchi: Not myself again.

>     No, Kagato in the Gundam Epyon.

>Kagato: DIE BITCHES, BASTARDS, RATS, PETS! THIS PUPPY'S LUCKY I AIN'T
>BLAST HIS ASS YET! Epyon's Weapon: *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky*
>*Squeaky*

>     Tenchi aimed the buster rifle at Epyon and pulled the trigger. A
>stream of water sprayed

Charlie:     . . . From Wing Zero's croch!
Luna:     Captain, We've sprung a leak!
Arlene:     Eh tu Luna?
Luna:     It was funny.

>from the nozzle. Tenchi then tried the beam saber then reads the side.
>Mag-Lite.

Goose:     So instead he tuns it around and Beats Kagato to death.
Luna<as Detroit Police Officer>:     SHOOT!  HE'S GOT A RAKE!!

>Tenchi: Figures.

>     As a last ditch Tenchi slams the self-destruct button and woke up
>screaming with Ryouko
>hovering over him.

>Ryouko: What Happened?

Goose<as Tenchi>:     I dreamed there was an alein about to attack me.
Wait, that's what's about
to happen.

>Tenchi: I had this dream that Tsunami and some maniac resurrected Kagato
>and he was attacking me with a squeaky bopper.

Luna<as Ryoko>:     Relax, it was just a fanfic.

>Ryouko: Man! Today just ain't your day.

>     Ryouko grabbed her left ear and pulled off her face to reveal that
>she's really . . .

>Kagato: DIE BITCHES, BASTARDS, RATS, PETS! THIS PUPPY'S LUCKY I AIN'T

Charlie:     I Knew it!  Kagato's a cross dresser!

>Kagato's Weapon: *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* *Squeaky* Wasyuu:

Arlene:   A fusional -holographic-geothermic-

centrifugal-electrodimensional-disturbance.
Goose:     That's a bout it, not exactly in that order but. . .
Arlene:     What does that mean?

>Ditch: End Theme! I tried so hard And got so far
>But in the end It doesn't even matter

Luna:     Jesus H., That actuly works?
All-Luna:      AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Luna:     Answer your question A.S.?
Arlene:     Not really.

Arlene:     I had to!
Goose:     No you didn't.  You chose to be here.
Arlene:     That was before I knew what I was getting into.

Arlene:     Is it safe to come out yet?
Goose:     Yeah, it's done.

      Back in the reception room the boys and girls are sitting in a circle
facing each other.

Arlene:     Jake, You said someone out there LIKED that?
Goose:     Yeah!  Ten out of ten carrots!  What did you think?
Arlene:     I think you should have your head examined!
Luna:     Well, If you make it to the disclaimer you should realize by then
it's a spoof.  And as
spoofs go, it hold it's own.  It's no Peter Suzuki, but it had It's moments.
Charlie:     Well I thought it was funny as hell.  What about you?
Goose:     I can't tell, it's my fic so it wouldn't be fair.

Autors notes

Goose (wildeyak2069@hotmail.com):    First and foremost, Thanks are do to
RPB 3000.   With out
his input this My.S.T. would have never happened.  So Everyone e-mail him
and tell him he needs
to rate more fanfics.  his e-mail is rpb3000@mad.scientist.com.
     If you read this and think I was too soft on it, all of my fics are
My.S.T. free.  Which is to say
open to all takers.
     And If you want to see what we do between My.S.T.s go to our website at
www.geocities.com/jakethegoose2069/fanart or www.geocities.com/gdluna98/.

Luna (the_american_shingami@hotmail.com):     Though I don't really agree
with the ratings he
gave Goose's Fics.  I absolutely agree that everyone should e-mail RPB and
tell him to rate more
fics.  Also  you should all go to his site //rpb3000.150m.com/.
     For the original fic all comments go to Goose.   For this M.S.T., he'll
take all the critcism, I'll deal
with all you moron Flame-throwers.

This has bee a 5150 fanfic production in association with the Goose's Art
Gallery and Luna's Attic.
