Disclaimer: I don't own any of these anime characters. I don't own the fic 
we MST (Thank
GOD!), and I don't own my friends Caitlin and Rich.

Out in the darkness of space floats a ship. Inside awaits the most 
terrifying trio of people
known to mankind.

Camera close-up of the lounge.

Holly Schafer: What? I'm not doing anything!
Caitlin Madison: Just because my hair is blue, does not mean I'm a Smurf, 
dammit.
Richard Anderson: Help.
These three people are present to collect a crew of MSTer's.
Richard (looking at camera): Actually, Caitlin and I were dragged here by 
Holly, I wanted
nothing to do with this.
Caitlin (looking annoyed at Richard): Speak for yourself! Holly said she was 
getting Shampoo.
(drifts off dreamily)...I love her hair....
Holly: ^_^'' Anyway, getting back to the narration....
Yes, these three people have come together for one purpose. To gather a crew 
of MSTers,
and make bad fanfiction pay.

Back at the lounge

Holly: Ok, I'm beaming in the cast  now.
Caitlin: Why are you doing this again? You don't even write fan fiction.
Holly (wincing): So? What does that have to do with anything?
Richard (cheerfully): I've written fan fiction.
Caitlin and Holly: Shut up!
<While Holly and Caitlin are busy having a "polite discussion", three 
bewildered anime
characters appear in front of them.>
Shampoo: What Shampoo doing here?
Tenchi (sweatdrop): Not more alien women!
Mamoru: Sweet Kami, not again! USAGI!!!!!

Holly and Caitlin continue their fight. This leaves Richard to welcome the 
new crew.
Richard: Hello, I'm Richard.
Mamoru: What do you want with me? Please, please say it has nothing to do 
with
brainwashing.
All (except Caitlin and Holly): ^_^''
Richard: I think I better leave the explanations to Holly, she heals faster.
Holly (to Caitlin): ...Now look, I've even left out Ryoga, to bring in 
Shampoo, because I know
how much you like her, and you aren't even going to be in the theater! 
(looks around) Oh, um,
hi guys! You all are probably wondering what you're doing here.
Others: Ya think?
Holly: Well to be completely blunt, I brought you here to help me MST fan 
fiction.
Shampoo, Tenchi, and Mamoru: AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Holly (frantically waving her hands to try and calm the three): I know, I 
know! But look at it
this way, I picked you guys because you usually get left out of MSTs.
Shampoo: Thank so much. Feel love already.
Mamoru: But that's all, just MSTs, no brainwashing, no killing, no plot to 
take over the
universe?
Richard: Weeeell....
Holly: NO!
Tenchi (looking thoughtful): Now, I've never actually read a fanfic, but how 
bad could they
be?
Caitlin (confused): Then what was with the initial scream?
Anime characters: Knee jerk reaction. Besides...(All look at Holly)
Holly: That's right, you don't really have a choice.  Now, Caitlin is going 
off to monitor us up in
the control booth, and Richard and I are going to be in the theater watching 
the fic with you
guys.
Richard: What?!
Holly: Didn't I tell you?
Richard: Um, noooo...
Holly: Oops! (rubs back of head) Silly me!

**FEEL THE RHYTHM, FEEL THE RHYME, COME ON TEAM---**
Holly: It's fanfic time! To the theater.
All rush to take their places in the theater. From right to left is Richard, 
Holly, Tenchi,
Shampoo, and Mamoru.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shampoo: What we do again?
Holly: Just make fun of the fic, and try not to kill each other. Now shh! 
It's starting.

>Euphoria - By Ryo-ohki

Tenchi (looking pale): That's, that's not the guy who wrote "In the Carrot 
Patch", is it?
Holly: I thought you didn't read fan fiction?
Tenchi: Even I've heard of this one.

>Warning : this is a lemon fanfic, this means that it has adult content, 
>throughout.
  >        Even though I believe in the abolishment of censorship

Holly: You would, you sick F*#@K
Richard: Is it that bad?
Holly: I hated it
Richard: *Ulp*

Mamoru: Wait, I thought he said he didn't believe that they should not be 
reading it. Don't the
two negatives cancel out?
Tenchi: Knowing this guy, it was a Freudian slip.

>Note : this is the sequel to my earlier story, "At the Carrot Patch",

Shampoo (to Holly): That one you mention earlier?
Holly: Yeah, a Sasami Lemon.
Tenchi (looks ill): With carrots, anal sex, and a cabbit.
Richard: Holly, what have you done to us?!

>	so if you like this

Tenchi: Don't! FOR THE LOVE OF KAMI DON'T!!!

Shampoo and Mamoru look pale.

Tenchi: I've got some comments I doubt he'll want to hear.

>And now on to the story....

All: SUUUUURE!

  >      The day began as any other day, but today was no ordinary day for 
Ryouko.

Tenchi: She didn't try waking me up naked.
Mamoru: Why is that such a problem?
Tenchi: Have you ever made a Jurain princess mad?
Richard shudders.
Holly: Are you implying something, Richard?
Shampoo: Anyway, um, back to fic.

>She was had a lot in store for Tenchi so that he would be hers forever.

Tenchi: This can't be good for me.
Mamoru: She was had?

 >She left the house shortly
>after lunch and told everyone that she wouldn't be back until late in the 
>night.  Everyone
>naturally assumed that she had gone on a date with some other man after 
>getting tired of
>pursuing Tenchi.

Holly: Yeah, pure logic right there.
Tenchi: Does the person writing this watch the series at all?
Holly: Does it matter? It's a lemon.

 >Ayeka thought that she would take advantage of the situation by making
>a romantic dinner that would capture Tenchi's heart and make him notice 
>her.

Tenchi: Ack!
Mamoru: I feel your pain, my friend.

>What nobody
>didn't know was that Ryouko hadn't actually left the house but was secretly 
>sitting in the
>basement to wait for the right time.

Shampoo: I watch show, not know there was basement.
Tenchi: That's funny, neither did I.

  >    Ayeka cooked two separate dinners, one for Tenchi and herself and one 
for everyone
>else.

Mamoru: My God! She's going to poison the rest of the family!
Richard: Either that, or kill herself and Tenchi.

>Ayeka also set up another table in a separate room, away from everyone else 
>so they
>wouldn't
>be interrupted.  Everyone came to the table sat down, and began the meal.  
>Ryouko turned intangible so that she was now able to come up through the 
>floor.  After poking her head
>through the floor she saw that neither Tenchi nor Ayeka were at the table 
>or Ayeka at the table anywhere.

Shampoo: So now have two Ayeka's?
Mamoru: Never mind that, couldn't Ryoko have just walked in the room and 
looked?

  >      "That wench, Ayeka, she took MY Tenchi" exclaimed Ryouko "I hope 
she's not
>planning
>to take MY Tenchi away from me because he's MINE.  "If I find that she's 
>with MY Tenchi I'll give her a beating that she'll never forget.  Maybe 
>then she'll learn not to steal
>my man, ever again.

Mamoru: She's got to be OOC now, right?
Tenchi (sighs): Sadly, the author got that part right.
Shampoo: Where quotation mark go?
Holly: Same place as the writer's brain?
Richard: In his pants.

  >      Ryouko sunk back under the floor to continue her search for Tenchi. 
  The first place
>she check was the bedrooms but found that they weren't there, which greatly 
>relieved
>Ryouko.

Holly: I thought she would be relieved when she checked the bathroom.
All: Holly!
Holly: ^_^

>She finally found them in a dark, secluded room that was connected to 
>Ayeka's bedroom
>that
>only Ayeka had access to, until now.

Mamoru: Ayeka has a dark, secluded room? I'd be frightened.
Tenchi: She doesn't...I hope.

>Ryouko came up through the floor, under the table and crouched under it.  
>She became solid again and was careful not to alert Ayeka of her
>presence.

Holly (Ryoko): Hey Ayeka! Is it OK if I give Tenchi head while you feed him? 
Oops! I said
that out loud, didn't I?
Mamoru (to Richard): Is she like this often?
Richard: All the time.
Mamoru: I don't know whether to feel envious of you, or sorry.
Richard: Feel sorry.

>Luckily Ayeka had used a long tablecloth that reached the floor so she 
>wouldn't be
>interrupted
>from her plans.  Slowly she knelt in front of Tenchi but didn't touch him 
>yet, she had to carefully plan this so that Tenchi wouldn't be too alarmed 
>so that she wouldn't alert anyone of
>her position.

Tenchi: Hey! I'm not female!
Holly: Are you sure?
Tenchi: What's THAT supposed to mean?
Holly: You have girls all over you! You completely ignore the fact that they 
want to bonk your
brains out! Maybe you're just gay.
Tenchi bonks Holly over the head with Tenchi-ken.
Holly: ow.

  >      After much thoughtful planning she brought her plans up to Tenchi's 
lap and lightly
>caressed
>the front of Tenchi's pants.

Tenchi turns a bright shade of red.

>Tenchi looked up at Ayeka at turned a bright shade of red.

Tenchi (a little shakily): Right on brother!

  >      "Oh Tenchi did I make your food too spicy for you?" inquired Ayeka

Mamoru (Tenchi): No Ayeka, Ryoko's just feeling up the front of my pants!
Holly (Ayeka): OK, just as long as it's not my cooking.

    >    Tenchi shook his head and returned to his meal trying not to give 
anything else away.
>Ryouko paused for a moment to see if Tenchi had given away her position.

Richard (Tenchi): Ryoko's hiding under the table!
Shampoo (Ryoko): Stupid boy, now I give kiss of death!
Tenchi: I can't win.

>After a couple seconds
>she continued to caress Tenchi's slowly hardening pole.  Soon Tenchi's dick 
>was at full mast
>and
>bloated with blood.

All: EEEEWWW!!!

 >His prick was becoming sore so Ryouko decided to undo his pants for him.

Holly: Well, that was sure nice of her.
Tenchi: Yeah, it was. (Realizes what he said.) No! I mean, it was WRONG!
All but Tenchi: ^_^''
Tenchi: I have to watch my back.

>She
>was almost hit in the face as his full length came flying straight at her 
>face.

Holly: THWAP!!
Tenchi: You know, you're not funny.
Mamoru and Shampoo (giggling): Yes, she is.

>Ryouko caught
>the bloated shaft at the base with her left hand

Richard: And stepped over homeplate.
Holly: Wrong baseball analogy.

>and softly started to run her fingers up and down
>his entire length.

Shampoo (Tenchi): Oh stop! That tickle!
Meanwhile Tenchi's nose begins gushing a small stream of blood.

>Tenchi tried hard not to moan, whimper

Mamoru: Or bleed to death.
Tenchi (holding nose): Nash not funny!

>or start breathing heavy as it would
>give away what was going on and he definitely didn't want this to stop.  
>The danger of the
>situation
>was very arousing for Tenchi.

Tenchi (indignant): Arousing? Are you insane? Ayeka would KILL me!! That's 
not arousing!
Holly: I'm beginning to see why no one else ever brought him up here.

>In an effort to release the tension, Tenchi curled his toes upwards.
>He accidentally stuck his toe of his shoe into Ryouko's groin.  Ryouko was 
>surprised at this
>and
>started to take her plan further.

Shampoo: They not going to...
Richard: Oh my god.
Holly (rocking herself): Jesus, I hate feet. I hate feet. I hate feet.
All look at Richard.
Richard: Um, Holly kinda has this thing about feet. They disgust her, and 
she freaks out when
people do weird things with them.
Holly (frantic): And why wouldn't I? Feet are hideous, stuck all day long in 
a shoe, festering in
their own juices....
All look sick.
Caitlin (from control booth): Just so you guys know, there are vomit bags 
under all of the
seats. Lots of them.

  >      Ryouko once again turned intangible and sunk back trough the floor.

All: YAY!!!

    >    "No, please don't leave me now, not when it was just getting good." 
Tenchi thought to
>himself

Tenchi: And bring back my period!
All look at him.
Tenchi: What? I'm doing the best I can, given the circumstances.

  >      Once in the basement Ryouko stripped herself of all her clothing 
but hadn't yet become
>solid.

Mamoru: Hmm, that must have been quite a feat, taking off all that 
intangible clothing.
All (singing): Oh, I'm too sexy to be solid, to sexy to be solid!

>When she was totally naked, she returned to the underside of the table and 
>resumed her
>caresses on
>Tenchi's upright dick.

Tenchi's nose begins gushing blood once more. Holly hands him a box of 
tissues.

>Tenchi exhaled a sigh of relief and contentment, Ayeka congratulated 
>herself
>on her meal as she thought Tenchi was merely enjoying the meal.

Shampoo (Ayeka): Oh thank Kami, he not dead! Am so glad am not Akane!
A mallet comes crashing down right beside Shampoo.
All: ^_^''

 >After Ryouko was sure that Tenchi was
>completely aroused, she slowly licked the underside of Tenchi's cockhead.

All start making chicken noises.

>Tenchi fought desperately
>to hold in his moans of pleasure.

Mamoru (Tenchi): Damn you moans, get back here! Quit struggling or in the 
name of the
moon...
Richard: Um, Mamoru?
Mamoru: Dear Kami, I have now officially spent too much time with Usagi.
Richard: Well, at least you didn't lapse into one of your Tuxedo Mask 
speeches.
Mamoru: And just WHAT is wrong with my speeches?!
Richard (pushing up glasses and sliding down in seat): Nothing.

  >      Tenchi knew what Ryouko was thinking and removed his shoe and sock 
off of his right
>foot.  He

Holly: Realized what he was about to do, and finished off his dinner. Thus 
killing himself and
ending the fic.
Others: You wish!

>once
>again stuck his foot back into Ryouko's groin and started to massage her 
>swollen clit with his
>big toe.

Holly: Oh God! *SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW*
Richard (looking at Holly): Poor thing.

>Ryouko pushed downward with all her weight and forced Tenchi's toe into her 
>love-canal.

Tenchi passes out from blood loss. *THUNK*
Richard: Caitlin, get some ice water in here pronto! (looks back and screen 
and bends over
vomit bag) If I have to see this, he does too! *BAAAAAAAAAAAARRRFFFF!!!*
Ice water appears and splashed Tenchi, who wakes up, looks at the screen, 
and grabs his
nose.
Tenchi: Nanks Richard.

>Tenchi began to

Holly (looking up from bag): Realize what he was doing was utterly wrong, 
and almost
completely impossible, so he stopped.

>move his toe around within Ryouko's womanly depths.

Holly (gagging): Damn.

>Ryouko began to suck wildly on Tenchi's throbbing cock as Tenchi's 
>half-kicked his foot upwards in an effort to get more of his toe inside
>Ryouko.

Tenchi's eyes grow as large a saucers.

>Ryouko
>swirled her tongue around the head as a way of thanking Tenchi.

Mamoru: Wow! I guess it just goes to show that you can't be the galaxy's 
most feared space
pirate without picking up a few tricks.
Shampoo (pulling bonbori out of hammerspace): What you say pervert?
Mamoru (watching screen): I just said, I guess it goes to---AHHH!!!  *THUD*
Shampoo: That better.

  >She moved her hips up and down in the same
>rhythm as Tenchi's upward strokes.  Ryouko bobbed her head down everytime 
>that Tenchi's
>foot came up and pushed down with her cunt lips in an effort to swallow 
>Tenchi's toe.

Richard (cunt lips): Chomp! Chomp!
Mamoru (Tenchi): Ah! My toe!

  >      Meanwhile everyone had finished their dinner and had gone about 
their regular
>activities.  Washuu was
>in her lab.  Sasami and Ryo-ohki were off playing outside as they always 
>do.

Holly: But thank God, not in the carrot patch.
Tenchi: Amen.

>But, Ayeka was eating as slowly
>as possible in an effort to savor her time with Tenchi.

Shampoo: How good company can he be? Not being articulate, not eating, just 
busy sticking
his foot up--
Holly: God, Shampoo, don't say it!
Shampoo: Sorry.

>        "Why aren't you eating your dinner Tenchi?"  Ayeka asked 
>inquisitively,  "Don't you like
>the meal that I made for you?"

Tenchi: That's beside the point Ayeka. Right now I'm busy--(realizes what 
he's saying)
AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! (Tenchi's nose explodes.)

  >      Tenchi scooped up some of what was on his plate with his fork and 
swallowed it.  He
>followed it up with
>a weak smile to make dissipate Ayeka's suspicions.  It didn't work however, 
>as she was
>beginning to suspect
>something was wrong.

Richard (Ayeka): Tenchi, is Ryoko under there giving you head?
Holly (Tenchi): Nooo.

  >      "Oh, yes!!!

Holly: Fine, admit to it and get yourself killed. I was just trying to help.

>Here it comes, I'm gonna cum straight down Ryouko's sweet throat" thought 
>Tenchi.  He
>put everything he had into bringing Ryouko over the edge of orgasm also.

Tenchi, who has now fallen between the seats, twitches. Holly takes another 
look at the screen
and lowers her head noisily to her vomit bag.

>Tenchi increased his pace without
>making it obvious.

Mamoru: Oh come on, that's got to be a little obvious.
Shampoo (Ayeka): Tenchi, why you stomp foot up and down like that?
Mamoru (Tenchi): Just scratching my toe!
Holly retches louder.
Mamoru: Oops! No pun intended.

>Under the table, Ryouko's head was bobbing madly up and down on Tenchi's 
>fully aroused
>prick.  Tenchi brought his hands down to his lap and placed them on the 
>back of Ryouko's
>head.  He brought
>Ryouko's head down faster and harder on his dick.  He felt  the head of his 
>cock hitting
>Ryouko's the back
>of Ryouko's throat.

Shampoo: Then she throw up too. End of fic.

  >Finally Ryouko rammed her lips down to the base of Tenchi's hard cock and 
savored the
>flavor of Tenchi's sweet jizz.

Shampoo: Damn.

 >At the same time, Tenchi kicked his foot up and lifted Ryouko up off the
>floor with one foot and jammed his foot as deep as he could into Ryouko's 
>dripping cunt.

Mamoru: Wouldn't that knock over the table?
Richard: With the way this guy writes, Ayeka would probably join them, 
instead of being mad.
Shampoo (hits Rich on head with bonbori): Not give author ideas!!

>She tightened her lips around Tenchi's huge dick and barely managed to keep 
>all of his cum in her mouth,
>without spilling any of it.
>Ryouko let it sit for a while and then swallowed it slowly so she could 
>feel it slipping down
>into her throat
>and into her stomach.

Holly lifts head up and begins making squelching noises. All other bend 
their heads over their
respective bags.
*SPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWW!!!!!*
Holly: Hee hee hee.

  >      Ryouko put Tenchi's sock and shoe back on, then sunk back into the 
basement where
>she got herself
>dressed again.  She then teleported herself outside and acted as if she had 
>just arrived home
>from the perfect
>date with the perfect man.

Shampoo (Sasami): You have nice date, Ryoko?
Mamoru (Ryoko): Yeah, he was so light on his feet.
Holly: *BLLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!*

  >      After cleaning up all the dishes from dinner, Ayeka turned her 
attention to Tenchi.

Richard (Ayeka): Now attention, you keep an eye on Tenchi for me, I have to 
go kill Ryoko.
Mamoru (Ayeka's attention): But why?
Richard (Ayeka): Because I am not a complete idiot, and I realize what she 
was doing.

>        "Are you alright, Tenchi?"  inquired Ayeka "You were acting very 
>strangely during
>dinner and I think
>you might be coming down with something."

Holly opens her  mouth:
Shampoo: Not one word, pervert girl. Or you get it just like pervert boys.
Holly closes her mouth.

>She put her hand to Tenchi's forehead, but felt nothing strange.
>"Maybe you're feeling lonely because Ryouko  left you tonight.  Well you 
>can forget about
>that slut,

Tenchi wakes up: Now that's a little harsh. Ryoko's not a slut!
Mamoru: She is in this fic.

>because
>I'm the one that really loves you.  Forget about that slut, she left for 
>her own personal needs
>without a
>second thought."

Shampoo (Tenchi): Actually, violent girl, she just--
Holly (hefting mallet from hammerspace): Hey now! If I can't do it, neither 
can you!
Shampoo: Fine, only boys can no make pervert comment.
Guys: AAAAWWWWW!!!

  >      Ayeka closed her door and then turned around and gave Tenchi a lust 
filled gaze.

Richard (Ayeka): Here, take it! You need it more than I do.

>She began to bring herself closer to Tenchi's body and pressed herself 
>softly against him.  She rubbed the
>tips of her tits against Tenchi's chest until her nipples became fully 
>erect and were visible
>through her kimono.

Holly: She must have looooong nipples.
Mamoru: Why:
Holly: Cause Ayeka wears a LOT of robes.

>Tenchi couldn't help but look down Ayeka's kimono as he hugged her close to 
>him.  His
>dick raised up and poked Ayeka in the stomach.

Shampoo: Hey, when Tenchi get the balls to do think like that?
Holly: I think he discovered them while Ryoko was caressing them.
Tenchi: Hey! I do too have ba-, have nu-
Holly: Can't even say it, huh?
Tenchi: Oh, leave me alone.

>        "Oh, Tenchi!" exclaimed Ayeka "are you getting turned on due to my 
>actions?"

Tenchi: No, I'm getting turned on because some sick author thinks it's a 
good idea.

>This wasn't one of the  questions that she was going to let Tenchi answer.  
>Ayeka reached
>out and

Richard: Pushed him over, running out of the room, and ending the fic.
Others: You wish!

>began to slowly stroke the front of Tenchi's slacks with her right hand.  
>With her left hand
>Ayeka reached for
>Tenchi's zipper and brought it down slowly so that it made a long buzzing 
>sound.

Holly (Ayeka): No, sorry, that's just the vibrator I had in my kimono. 
That's why I didn't
notice Ryoko earlier.
Tenchi raps Holly on the head with his sword.
Holly: OW!

>Tenchi brought both of his hands to Ayeka's shoulders and slid her kimono 
>down off of her shoulders.  Tenchi found
>that Ayeka had planned
>all of this by the fact that she wore no bra and was completely bare under 
>her kimono. Tenchi let the top half
>of Ayeka's kimono hang down and brought his hands to Ayeka's fleshy 
>breasts.

Mamoru: Now, now, she's not sagging. Her breasts aren't that fleshy.

>  He gently kneaded the flesh that

Shampoo: Began to rise. Then Tenchi make breast bread ever!
Others (except Holly): O_0'
Holly: HAHAHAH! Good one, Shampoo. (Gives Shampoo a high five.)
Richard (looking at other guys): Now there's two of them!

>was Ayeka's tits.  He started around the soft edges and worked his way in 
>towards her erect
>nipples that stood out
>a full half-inch from the rest of her tit.  Ayeka began to moan audibly as 
>the sensations ran
>from her nipples
>from her nipples to her sensitive clitoris.

All: ???
Holly (sensations): Run, run, as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm-  
*THUNK*
Richard (putting mallet away): Unconscious.

>Tenchi took each nipple between a thumb and a finger and began to
>rub it back and forth between them.  He leaned forward and took one into 
>his mouth, Tenchi
>ran a lap around the
>sensitive nipple with his tongue.

Holly (Tenchi as Rimmer): Seven minutes. Not a bad little time for the mile.
Richard: No more Red Dwarf for you!

>Then he took the fully erect nipple between his teeth and began to nibble 
>on
>it slightly, while nibbling he kept licking the tip with the end of his 
>tongue.

Shampoo (clutching chest in pain): That sound like it hurt!
Holly: Well, not really. It's just one of those things you have to be in the 
mood for...(Other's
look at her)...What?
Mamoru: Richard?
Richard looks up while whistling.

  >      Ayeka slipped Tenchi's full cock out through the fly in Tenchi's 
pants.

Shampoo (Ayeka): Whoops! No mean to drop. Just is slippery.
All guys wince.
Holly and Shampoo: Hee hee.

 >It stood out a full eight inches
>from his hips.  Ayeka was mesmerized by its length and width that she never 
>knew possible.

Richard: You are getting sleeeepy.
Holly: You know, that's not all that impressive for a penis. It's not like 
it's a foot long or
anything.
Tenchi (with box of tissues jammed into his nostrils): Whash that shupposed 
to bean?

>She kneeled down on the ground in front of Tenchi and pulled him down onto 
>her mattress with her.  Tenchi lay down
>on the bed to see what
>she was going to do.

All: RUN!!!

>Ayeka was at his feet, kneeling at the edge of the bed.  She undid the 
>button on his pants
>and
>pulled them off his muscular legs,

All except Tenchi: Muscular? Ahahahahahah!
Tenchi: Hey! (looks at screen) I don't look like that!

>and gracefully threw them into a corner of the room.  Tenchi took of his 
>shirt
>and threw it into another corner of the room.

Mamoru: But not as gracefully as Ayeka threw his pants.

>Ayeka crawled forward so that she had her soft lips positioned
>above Tenchi's upright dick.  She licked all around the tip, lubricating it 
>with her saliva.  She
>bobbed her head
>down all the way to the base a couple of times so that the entire thing was 
>lubricated up. Ayeka stood up on her
>knees and walked forward until she was directly above Tenchi's cock.

Holly (airplane pilot): Air Traffic Control, we are requesting permission to 
land.
Shampoo (ATC): Permission denied. Please leave area.

>Tenchi placed his hands upon her hips and looked deep into her eyes.

Mamoru (Tenchi): Ayeka? Since when did you wear contacts?

>He could tell that she wanted him badly because her womanly moisture was 
>dripping down
>and lubing his dick even more.

Richard (singing): Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain- Urk!
Holly and Shampoo (each putting blunt objects away): Don't sing.

>They both smiled at each other which signaled that they were both ready.

Mamoru: On your mark! Get set! GO!

 >Tenchi
>forced Ayeka's hips down as she dropped all of her weight downwards.

Holly (Tenchi): Oof! God, Ayeka, get off me! I never knew you were so heavy!
Out of nowhere a force field of small logs surround Holly.   *ZAAAAAAAAP*
Holly (smoking): I...take...that...back.

>Tenchi's huge prick drove deep into Ayeka's
>warm depths.  Tenchi pulled down until Ayeka's pussy lips had come all the 
>way down to
>the very base of his manhood.
>He held Ayeka down so that they could both enjoy the pleasure of their 
>first sexual
>experience together.

All: *ZZZZZ*

>Tenchi
>pushed up on Ayeka's hips, her cunt made a delightful squishing sound as 
>Tenchi penetrated
>her pussy.

Richard: Hey! Anyone remember Gak?
Holly: That gooey, slimy stuff that they used to sell? Yeah, why?
Richard: I'm betting you could get a sound like that this with that stuff.
Others: Ick.
Richard: Hee hee. I spend too much time with my girlfriend.
Mamoru: What about Holly?  *THUNK*  (Flattened) Oh.

>He stuffed
>himself into her inch by inch.  Once he had totally buried his meat inside 
>his lover's hole,

Shampoo: So that what he do with rest of dinner.
Mamoru: *Urp*

>he brought her back up so that just the head of his dick was left inside 
>her, slowly brought her back down to the very
>base of his dick.

  >      Oh! Dearest Tenchi, you feel so good inside me.  Pump you dick into 
me harder,
>faster, oh yes!!  Doesn't this make you feel better after that wench, 
>Ryouko, left you for another man?

Holly:...
Richard: Leave it, Holly!

>        Ayeka began to raise and lower herself on Tenchi's cock faster and 
>faster until they
>both had gotten into
>a pounding rhythm.  Tenchi looked up and saw Ayeka's tits flopping up and 
>down in front of
>his face.

Girls: OUCH!

>He couldn't
>resist, so he reached up with both hands and grabbed them.  He pinched both 
>nipples and
>began rolling them between
>his fingers.  He leaned forward and buried his face between Ayeka's 
>beautiful, round tits.

Holly: PHUUF!!!
Others (except Richard): ???
Holly: Here, I'll show you. (Pushes Richard down on the floor, lifts up his 
shirt, puts her mouth
on his tummy and blows)
Others: Oh...Hee hee hee.

>Tenchi rubbed his face
>up and down between her tits, trying to get more of that wonderful, musky 
>odor into his
>nostrils.  Tenchi licked
>the flesh between the fleshy mounds.  He pressed both of her pert breasts 
>together close
>enough so her could get
>both nipples in his mouth at the same time.

Shampoo (looking down at chest): I no think things can flop and be pert at 
same time.
Mamoru: Smile and nod, Shampoo.

>Tenchi bit them gently between his front teeth to keep them in his
>mouth, at the same time he tugged on them slightly.  He began to flick his 
>tongue across the
>both of her nipples.
>Ayeka moaned out loud and continued to pound herself on to Tenchi's slick 
>meat.

  >      "Damn, your cunt is so tight Ayeka!" Tenchi managed to moan

    >    Tenchi grabbed either side of his lovers' hips to slow her down as 
they both
>approached orgasm.  Finally

All: Finally is right!

>Tenchi rammed his cock as far as it would go into Ayeka's warm depths as he 
>shot his
>searing load of jizz up into
>her womb.

Mamoru (Ayeka): AH! It burns! It burns!
The girls just look sick.

>Her cunt muscles contracted in an effort to milk the cum out of his balls.

Richard (guy from cereal commercial): Shouldn't we tell her that's a boy 
cow?
Others: LAME!

>        "Thank you Tenchi, you have proven to me how much you love me.  Now 
>Ryouko
>can't take you away from me, ever!  You belong to me now.  But for now you 
>must rest.  From the way you were acting
>earlier on in the evening,
I'd say you were sick.

Richard (Ayeka): And I'd be right! You are sick, Tenchi!
Tenchi: I feel so used.

>I'll be back to check on you later, to see that you are alright."

Tenchi (gasping): AHHH! Commitment!!!!!!
Richard: Whew! She sounds a bit possessive for me. Don't let her find out 
about Ryoko,
Tenchi, or you may find Ryo-oh-ki boiling in a pot one day.
Holly (beating Rich over the head with her mallet): Leave the cabbit out of 
this.

Cut to lounge.

All member of the crew are sitting in various chairs around a table.
Caitlin: So, how was it?
Shampoo: Aiyah! Was awful!
Tenchi: Why, oh why, did you guys bring me up here?
Holly: Because I figured you just needed to be punished.
Tenchi: O_O
Holly: Well, um, you are kinda, um, spineless.
Ryoko and Ayeka appear, in full battle gear.
Both: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!!
Holly: AW, COME OFF IT! YOU KNOW I'M TELLING THE TRUTH!
Ryoko and Ayeka look at Tenchi, then at Holly, and hang their heads: Sorry.
Exit Ryoko and Ayeka.
Holly: Anyway, I'm going to send you all back to your realities now. But 
don't think it's over.
Anime characters: *Gulp*
Holly: Oh, and Caitlin...
Caitlin: Yes?
Holly: You and Richard are switching places next time.
Rich: Yes! (Does a happy dance around the table.)
Caitlin: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Others: Hee hee.

AUTHOR'S NOTES:
So, this was my first MST. I've taken to reading ones written by others, and 
I thought I could
do one too. I hope you found it at least mildly amusing. If you liked it, 
saw potential, or have
any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, email me a powder96@hotmail.com

As for the fic, I read "At the Carrot Patch". This is much better. That 
doesn't make this good,
mind you, just better than THAT atrocity. I especially like the fact that 
you left Sasami out of
this. Oh, and the anal sex. I really want you to understand one think. 
(Inhales) WOMEN DO
NOT ENJOY ANAL SEX! WE DO NOT HAVE A PROSTATE! ANAL SEX IS VERY
PAINFUL TO WOMEN! Thanks!
Ja ne!
