I know this is just plain dumb, but I felt like writing it anyway.

Pioneer owns all the TM! references.
Akira Toriyama and TOEI inc. own the DBZ references.
Other ppl own the other references


Ryosashuka
A totaly pointless Tenchi Muyo! fanfic by
~Brain~Wav~

One day, Ryoko met a short purple guy with a white mohawk called Kaioushin.  
He gave her a pair of potara earrings then he left.

Later, Washu tinkered with the earrings and made it so they could be used over and over.  
Ryoko got them back then she clonked Washu out and use them on her, they became Ryo-shu, 
the Universe's Smartest Space Pirate.  Then, Ryo-Shu ran to the kitchen where Sasami was 
cooking, she used the earrings on her and they became Ryosashu, 
the Universe's Smartest Space Pirate and Best Cook.

Ayeka demanded to know what was going on, so Ryosashu K.O.'ed her and used the earrings again, 
to become Ryosashuka, the Universe's Smartest Space Pirate Princess and Best Cook.  
She then proceded to Tenchi's room and took out Tenchi-ken.  Due to Ayeka being part of her, 
she was able to get the rest of her gems.

At this time, Mihoshi crashed into the house.  Ryosashuka teleported to her and was about 
to use the earrings, but decided she didn't want to be dumber and summoning her holo laptop, 
turned her into a Kappa.  Tenchi had now returned from the fields and saw Ryosashuka with a 
blonde kappa on one shoulder and Ryo-Ohki in the other.  Ryosashuka told him about what 
happened, and no longer having to choose between the girls, they were married and lived happily ever after.
The End
