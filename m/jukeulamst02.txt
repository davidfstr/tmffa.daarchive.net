::The scene opens on Jukeula, who is struggling to repair a futuristic
     computer console.  (i.e. wall-mounted keyboards.  It must be. . .
     the future!)::

JUKEULA:  <Whispered to the camera>  I gotta warn you guys.  The STTS
     field is on the fritz -- you know, the thing that keeps
     our powers in check.  I'm attempting repairs as we speak, so it
     shouldn't be much of a problem, but I'm really hoping the others
     won't find out.  They might try to escape again.

-- :: Meanwhile, in the lobby :: --

MBPD:  Look, guys!  My powers are working!  <MBPD creates a one foot
by one foot gateway to Pretty Space>  We can escape now!

MISAKA:  Through a one-foot hole?  That's likely.

MBPD:  Well, I can't get it any larger than that. . .  <shouts up
through the ceiling>  Juke?  Why isn't my fruityness at full strength?

::Muffled curses are heard from upstairs.  Jukeula runs into the room.::

JUKEULA:  <Panting>  How did.. you find out.. about the STTS field
glitching?

MISAKA:  We were reading the script.

JUKEULA:  Well, I don't suppose I have to worry that much.  Only
Diralxbaliel could fit through that portal, and he's not that important
anyway.

::Diralxbaliel grumbles in the corner::

MISAKA:  That's what I said.  But then I came up with a plan: let us
go, or I start shoving things over to fruity-space.

JUKEULA:  Like what?

MISAKA:  Like this.  <Holds up a laminated picture of Merle.>

JUKEULA:  What.. how.. when.. wha.. .. HOW DID YOU GET THAT???

MBPD:  That's not important.  Let Misaka and I go, or Merle gets it!

DIRALXBALIEL:  Misaka and me.

MBPD:  Yeah, thanks.  Let Misaka and me go-

DIRALXBALIEL:  No, I really meant Misaka and me.  You can stay here,
Loompa-boy.

MBPD:  You shut up, you.. weird flying thing!

DIRALXBALIEL:  Mammal.

::Baliel and Donny start fighting - Baliel with bites, Donny with lots
of sprinkles.::

MISAKA:  <Flustered>  This has got to be the most ineffective escape
attempt in the history of MSTings.  Oh, well.  <Tosses Juke the picture>

::Jukeula and Misaka head towards the theater.  MBPD has grabbed Baliel
and is shoving him into fruity space.::

-- :: In the theater :: --

::Four seats are silhouetted near the bottom of the screen.  Jukeula sits
on the far left, Misaka two seats over.  MBPD and Diralxbaliel enter.::

DIRALXBALIEL:  I thought we'd have a fair fight, but noooo, you had to 
     pull out the strawberries.

::They take their seats as the movie begins - MBPD to Misaka's left,
Diralxbaliel to her right.::

>>When Dimensions Collide: a Tenchi Muyo, Dragonball Z, fanfic crossover

MBPD:  That doesn't sound good.
DIRALXBALIEL:  I agree.  That sentence really needed an 'and'.  Or at
     least one less comma.

>>Disclaimer:
>>Tenchi Muyo belongs to the great Masaki Kajishima & Pioneer LDC

MISAKA:  All hail the great and terrible Masaki Kajishima!
JUKEULA:  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!

>>Dragonball Z belongs to the magnificent Akira Toriyama (and if some company
>>made it I am sorry but I do not know your name)

JUKEULA:  Hey, that's what I said.

>>I do not mean to copy the work of these people and/or companies all of the
>>characters I am going to use are not mine and I do not wish to steal them
>>from anyone (please do not sue me I am so broke it took me 2 years to afford
>>this computer)

DIRALXBALIEL:  Uh.. Okay, transplant some commas from the title to that 
     sentence.

>>Topic of Story :Bulma is bored, she decides to make a time
>>machine/dimensional transporter like future Bulma did, when Trunks an Goten

MBPD:  <Bulma>  Stupid Washu thinks she's the only one who can make a time 
     machine, huh?  Well, mine will make Frogourt, too!

>>start fooling around with the machine they end up in the Tenchi universe.

MISAKA:  Wow.  That was a short fic.  <Stands up>
JUKEULA:  It's not done yet.
MISAKA:  But we already know the plot!  What's the point of staying?

>>You can E-mail me at: supergohan@hotmail.com
>>You guys can call me: SuperGohan

MBPD:  Hence the E-mail address.
JUKEULA:  I'd rather not call you at all.

>>This is my fist fanfic ever so please be nice. If you send me flames do not

DIRALXBALIEL:  Well, this is as good a time as any.  <Floats higher and faces 
     the camera, donning unneccesary reading glass and holding a prepared 
     statement.>  This MST is intended as a way to get people to laugh.  No 
     disrespect is meant to the author of "When Dimensions Collide," even if the 
     fic totally sucked.. <skims ahead> ..learn to write, you.. <skims to the 
     end> ..with a melon??  Alright, who messed with my speech?
::Jukeula, Misaka and MBPD all put on totally-innocent expressions.::
DIRALXBALIEL:  That's not funny, guys.  SuperGohan's going to be pissed.

>>expect me to be happy. (Nobody likes being criticized)

DIRALXBALIEL:  See??

>>Signs: "character is saying something"
>>(Authors notes)
>>*Thinking*

JUKEULA:  It's never a good sign when the author has to explain the rules of grammer he's using.

>>The story:




MISAKA:  Well?  We're waiting.

>>"Jeez I am bored."said Bulma "I haven't had anything exciting happen to me
>>in years." "Woman do not bother me with your problems I have training to
>> do."said Vegeta "Well excuse me some husband you are!!!!!!!!" "Hi kasaan"

EVERYONE:  AAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
MBPD:  Slow down!

>>said Trunks (Trunks is 18 Goten is 17) "Hi hon how was school?" "Same thing

MISAKA:  Should I know who these characters are?
MBPD:  No, these guys are from Dragonball Z.  You've only seen Tenchi fanfics.
JUKEULA:  Hey, I've seen Dragonball Z, and *I* have no idea who these characters 
     are.

>>everyday, sleep through 2/3 of my classes then wake up for lunch" "Do

>>in a while I think it's about time I show you what a real Saiyan battle is
>>not some sparring like that 3rd class Saiyan Kakarot. "Hello to you to

MBPD:  <Stares in wonder at the screen, then decides to ignore it.>  Hey, Juke, 
     why was that picture lamininated?
JUKEULA:  For easy clean-up.
::Sweatdrops all around::
MBPD:  Ewwwwww...
MISAKA:  YOU'RE disgusted?? I had that thing in my pocket!

>>tousan. By the way, Goten and me are going to the Movie Theater. He's going
>>with Paris & I'm going with this girl I met in school named Lauren." "I don'

JUKEULA:  *TOM* Paris?
MBPD:  Leave your Voyager references out of this.

>>t think said a sad Goten" *man I should have never gave Goten that key to

MISAKA:  It truly IS the key to the greatest treasure in all the land!

>>the house* "Paris dumped me" "are you okay Goten" "Yeah, I guess so" "Well

DIRALXBALIEL:  <Shouts>  BAD THING!!!!
MISAKA:  Huh?
::Diralxbaliel quivers::

>>better tell Lauren that the dates off" "I got it!" said Bulma. "Got what?"
>>"I am going to invent a transdimensional transporter" "Cool"
>>(One month later)

JUKEULA:  Was that last sequence supposed to be that stupid?
DIRALXBALIEL:  Think so I do!
JUKEULA:  ...what?

>>"I am finally finish," said a satisfied Bulma "Trunks, Goten come see my

DIRALXBALIEL:  Period and 'ed' make good sentence from bad.  Like magic!
JUKEULA:  I think he's broken.

>>latest invention." (Trunks and Goten come running in Trunks is chasing Goten
>>telling him to give him the TV control) "Give it back" "ya gotta catch me

MISAKA:  Whoa... Maxim flashback.

>>first!" of course this earns them an hour-long lecture from you know who.

MBPD:  No, we don't.
MISAKA:  Tenchi, of course.

>>"Sorry" said the inseparable friends. After explaining what the dome shaped
>>contraption was both boys could only say one thing "wow" "Well do you wanna

DIRALXBALIEL:  Period make good when in line.  SPOON!
MBPD:  The bad grammer must really be getting to him.

>>go in" "You bet" said the boys. So they both went in "wow looks way bigger

JUKEULA:  ...through your clothes.
MBPD:  Shut up, Juke.

>>inside!" "Yep" unfortunately Goten could not control his temptation any more

JUKEULA:  <Giggles>

>>"wow look at the buttons" said a half drooling Goten "Goten don't" but in

DIRALXBALIEL:  Sentence make sense last no did that.

>>order to finish this fanfic Goten (like ya didn't know) push the buttons.

MBPD:  <Goten>  I wanna push the button!
MISAKA:  Elelator go up, elelator stop.

>>"Being transported to dimension 2r57yu8p9066fgjl6" said the electronic voice
>>"Goten, Trunks!!!!" yelled Bulma. Nevertheless, of course it was too late
>>and they disappeared. After two minutes of thinking Bulma could only say one
>>thing "Chi-Chi is gonna freak"





::Jukeula, MBPD and Misaka take this convienent break to try to snap 
     Diralxbaliel out of his temporary insanity.  They are unsuccessful.::

>>Tenchi was not having a good day fist of all he was awaken to see Ryoko

JUKEULA:  ...fig-
MBPD:  Don't say it, Juke.
MISAKA:  Don't say what?
JUKEULA:  ...figuri-
MBPD:  DON'T SAY IT, JUKE!
::Pause::
JUKEULA:  ...figuring out how many licks it takes to get to the creamy filling 
     of a Tenchi-Pop.
MBPD:  <Head explodes>

>>about to pounce on him. Next, when he went to the bathroom Aeaka tried to

DIRALXBALIEL:  ...take Aeka's place.
JUKEULA:  Good to have you back, Baliel.
DIRALXBALIEL:  It's good to be back, Juke.

>>sneak in with him, which caused Ryoko an Ayeaka to start fighting. (Like it

DIRALXBALIEL:  Three sentences in, and we already have two new characters.

>>was not going to happen any way) After that, Washu tried to experiment on

JUKEULA:  <To Misaka>  You know, Miska-chan, for a full line of this fanfic, we 
     were alone together.
::Misaka waves her arm and Jukeula is smashed into the wall of the theater.::
MISAKA:  I bet now you're thinking that you've got to get the STTS field 
     repaired, huh?

>>him. Then Mihoshi kept screaming something about tampons. In addition, to

JUKEULA:  Mihoshi strikes me as more of an "Ultra-thin with wings" type girl.
MISAKA:  <Sighs.>  You just don't stop, do you?

>>top it all of Yosho had just finish beating the crap out of him. "Ahhh" said
>>Tenchi "nothing like doing something normal as going to the fields."

DIRALXBALIEL:  Because, of course, EVERY boy in Japan has to pick carrots daily 
     to feed his pet spaceship.
JUKEULA:  Shouldn't that be "their pet spaceship"?
DIRALXBALIEL:  Don't doubt me, Juke.

>>Suddenly four screams were heard" (insert special earsplitting affects) "Oh

::Jukeula, Misaka and Diralxbaliel all scream.  Diralxbaliel checks the fic, 
     then screams again.::
DIRALXBALIEL:  Who said that??

>>no the girls!!!" Tenchi suddenly pulled out the Tenchi-ken. (where did it

JUKEULA:  Ewwwww!  Tenchi, put that thing back in your pants!

>>come from you ask? Short answer: I have no idea.) Running as fast as he
>>could he went to see what was happening. "What's wrong?" All he could see
>>was the Sasami, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Aeka standing there. "Well" suddenly,

JUKEULA:  Hey, Donny, better regrow your head or something.  Sasami's up there.
::Bicycle wheels are heard in the background::

>>there was a flash of white light. Then there was this big white dome where
>>the light had been.

MISAKA:  Ohh, descriptive.
::Three rabbits on bicycles enter the theater, pulling a cart with a new head 
     for MBPD on it.  The head flies over and attaches itself to MBPD, who 
     stands and retakes his seat.::
MBPD:  <To the exiting rabbits>  Thank Oji-san and Batako-san for me!
MISAKA:  Well, that was obscure.



>>Trunks and Goten where very disoriented after two minutes of trying to stand

MBPD:  ...on the record player.
JUKEULA:  That wasn't very funny.
MBPD:  Well, what do you want?  I've only had this brain a few seconds.

>>up they finally realized what happened "baka you sent us to another

DIRALXBALIEL:  Commas are a good thing.

>>dimension what if where stranded here?" "gomen nasai" said Goten. "Well we
>>better see what's out there," said Goten. Trunks opens the door to see a
>>fairly big house and eight strangers (count the four girls, Tenchi,
>>Nobuyuki, and Yosho and Washu) "Grandpa I sure hope these people aren't

MBPD:  Shouldn't Washu be including as one of the girls?
DIRALXBALIEL:  Yes, it be good if "five girls and "then other.
JUKEULA:  Not again...

>>friends of yours" said Ryoko. "I have never met the two youngsters." Said
>>Yosho. "Well they sure are hot." Said Aeka. (Everyone looks at Aeka) "What I

JUKEULA:  Can we say out-of-character?

>>can like other people besides Tenchi!" said Aeka.

JUKEULA:  Like, yes.  But not say "they sure are hot" when you first meet them.


>>"Talk to them," said Goten "no way you talk to them you're the one that got
>>us here in the first place" said Trunks. "fine" said Goten

MISAKA:  "Good thing that's settled" said Misaka.

>>While Goten and Trunks are trying to figure out what to do Washu scans them

JUKEULA:  <Washu>  And just my size, too!

>>both "Impossible" "What's impossible Washu-chan?" "I just finished scanning
>>them and it seems that there energy is just as high as Ryoko's and Tenchi'

JUKEULA:  <Washu>  Their power level is rising!
MBPD:  <Washu>  That's impossible!
JUKEULA:  ...and so one for several episodes.

>>s." "What!!! these people are most definitely aliens!!!" said Tenchi. "I bet

MISAKA:  The people who showed up in a giant pillar of light??  No, certainly 
     not, no...

>>I could beat them." Said Ryoko
>>(back to Goten and Trunks)

JUKEULA:  Wait, Ryoko's back was to Goten and Trunks?
MBPD:  Maybe Ryoko's walking back to Goten and Trunks.
MISAKA:  Who cares?

>>"What should I say Trunks?" asked Goten "I don't know say you come in peace
>>or something or hi."

JUKEULA:  You come in peace.
MBPD:  Something.
MISAKA:  Hi.

>>(back to the Tenchi gang)

>>"You're right Tenchi they are half aliens. Hmmm. lets see what type they

JUKEULA:  <Washu>  ...like.  Young and innocent girls, aggressive and busty 
     space pirates, pristine and bitchy princesses, naive and clumsy blondes, 
     beautiful and brilliant scientists, or... Tenchi?

>>are." "How are you gonna find that out Washu-chan?" asked Aeka.  "Did you
>>forget? I am the smartest scientist in the Universe!!!!!!!" (Insert special

MBPD:  No, you're the 'greatest scientific genius' in the Universe.

>>effects for big sweat drop.) "Let me see hmmm. that's interesting they don't

MISAKA:  What's a 'hmmm'?

>>seem to be on my data banks." "I guess we better ask them."said Aeka.

MISAKA:  <Gasp>  Brilliant!

>>(Back to the two friends)

MBPD:  <Suddenly gasps and slaps himself on the forehead>  My roast!
::MBPD gets up and runs out of the theater.::

"Well here I go. I sure hope they know Japanese."said Goten "Just get it
over with jeez."said the purple haired warrior. "Um hi I am Son Goten  and

MISAKA:  "Purple haired warrior?"  Which one's he?
JUKEULA:  Trunks, I think.

my friend here is Trunks Briefs Vegeta."

MISAKA:  <Laughs>  His name is "Trunks Briefs Vegeta"?

>>"The one that calls himself "Goten" seems to be the leader or something."
>>Said Ryoko. "I should probably say hi." Said Tenchi. "Hello my name is

MISAKA:  ...Slim Shady.
::MBPD reenters the theater carrying a steaming pork-roast.  He pulls a carving 
     knife from Pretty Space and hands both it and the platter to Misaka.::
MBPD:  You do the honors.
MISAKA:  Alright.  Who wants some?
JUKEULA:  Me!...  oh, you meant some of THAT.

>>Masaki Tenchi and this is Ryoko Hakubi and her mother Washu Hakubi and these
>>two are princess Sasami and princess Aeka oh yeah and this is Mihoshi."

DIRALXBALIEL:  The comma is the little curly mark next to the period on your 
     keyboard.  Look for it, it's not that hard to find.
MBPD:  Back amongst the sane again, Baliel?
DIRALXBALIEL:  Donkey flavin?

>>"Well now that you met me and the girls here is Masaki Noboyuki my father
>>and my Grandpa and our pet cabbit Ryo-ohki."everyone said there "hi" in

MISAKA:  Noboyuki is his father, his grandfather AND his pet cabbit??
MBPD:  Uh... no, that was just bad phrasing.
MISAKA:  Oh.  This roast is really good, by the way.
MBPD:  Thanks!

>>their own way and Ryo-ohki just "meowed" in reply.

JUKEULA:  She 'miya's.
MBPD:  What's wrong, Juke?  You haven't touched your food.
JUKEULA:  Donny...  I'm a vampire.

>>As Goten and Trunks went up to meet them in person Ryoko thought of an evil
>>sceme. *What if I test how strong these two are hehehe. * Suddenly, both

MBPD:  <Near tears>  Are you SURE you don't want any?
JUKEULA:  Okay!  Fine!  <Starts eating>  There, are you happy?
MBPD:  What do you think of it?
JUKEULA:  Needs more blood.

>>Trunks and Goten see Ryoko teleporting. "Where did she go? Asked Trunks.

MISAKA:  "I don't know.  Said Misaka.
DIRALXBALIEL:  I'm impressed.  I thought only I could say silent punctuation.
MISAKA:  What do you mean?
DIRALXBALIEL:  ...

>>Suddenly, Goten felt Ryoko's presence behind him. "Trunks watch out!" Trunks
>>turned around in time to see an energy blast go straight to his chest. After

JUKEULA:  ...his death, he will be given the Sirius Declaration. 
MBPD:  What are you talking about?
JUKEULA:  Well, I had to say *something*.

>>the smoke clears up, we see a very agitated Trunks looking at Ryoko. "Did

MBPD:  Dammit!  Here I was, completely caught up in this fic's compelling 
     dialogue and original story, when I read the phrase "we see a" and was 
     immediately brought back to reality by its script-format-ness!  <Shouts in 
     anguish>  And it was such a good fic until then!!!
::Silence.::
MBPD:  That was sarcasm, people.
ALL OTHERS:  Ohhhh.

>>you have any reason for doing that huh?" said the very agitated saiyan.

MISAKA:  Which one's he?

>>"What the hell!!! I hit you with an energy blast and you come out without
>>even a scratch!!! Who or what are you?" "First of all I was going over there

JUKEULA:  Does anyone here know who was just talking?

>>to say hi and you just throw a ki blast at me!!!" "Is this how you normally

MBPD:  A Pixy Misa ki blast.  Get it?  Mi-Sa-Ki?  Misaki?
::Silence.  Crickets chirp.::

>>treat people?" "No the bakemono is usually worst then this." Said a certain

JUKEULA:  ...bitch.

>>purple haired princess (strange hair colors don't ya think?) "I will get you
>>for that princess." "Well I guess I better tell you people why we are here."

MISAKA:  <Director>  Okay, good, but try it with a little *less* emotion.

>>Goten explains everthink about the Dragonball Z senshi and Tenchi also
>>explains his side. By the time they are all done it is already night. "Wow

MISAKA:  Okay, I got one:
     Tenchi also speaks,
     By the time they are done, it
     Is already night.
::Applause from the other MSTers::

>>time sure does fly, well me and Trunks better start finding a way to get
>>back home good bye everyone." "wait you don't have to leave its almost
>>midnight and I know I'm no scientist but judging by the look of your machine
>>you won't be lieving for a while." Said Tenchi. "Oh crap" was all Trunks

JUKEULA:  "Lieving?"  Baliel, you want to help us out on this one?
DIRALXBALIEL:  Oh my God!  Nilbog is Goblin spelled backwards!
JUKEULA:  Nevermind.

>>could say while Goten started histerically crying. After an hour of getting
>>Trunks out of his hypnotic trance and calming Goten down everyone was able
>>to finnally sleep including Trunks and Goten.

MBPD:  Up until I read this fic, I was relatively sure that Finnish people slept 
     like everyone else.



>>Authors notes: I wrote this fic because I notice that to find a Dragonball Z
>>crossover with Tenchi Muyo was like finding a needle in a haystack. And this

JUKEULA:  Yeah, SuperGohan, there's a reason for that.

>>is only the beginning I intend to right more on two conditions

MISAKA:  Condition one:  The world doesn't crash into the sun.
JUKEULA:  Uh... why?
MISAKA:  Hey, I'll do whatever it takes to stop a sequel from manifesting.
::Sweatdrops all around.::

>>1.) I get good reviews by my readers, send me e-mail I will write back if

JUKEULA:  HA!

>>you want

MBPD:  <Dancing and singing>  What you really really want, just tell me what you 
     want, what you really really want...
::MBPD is pelted by popcorn from all sides.::

>>2.) I find nothing else to do and make chapter 1

MISAKA:  Didn't we just read chapter one?

>>If I don't get any e-mail I will look at the story and do what I thinks is
>>best

MBPD:  You got to do what you thinks is best, foo.

>>Well until next time
>>See ya ^_^

::The MSTers wave as they exit the theater::

-- :: In the lobby :: --

MISAKA:  Does everybody know what time it is?

OTHERS:  Commmentary time!

MBPD:  I'd just like to thank you for keeping Sasami's screen time to a minimun.  Judging by the way the other characters acted, seeing your version of Sasami could have scarred me for life.

DIRALXBALIEL:  Sometimes I read fics "that contain spelling and " grammer 
errors.but rarely as often as this one did?  Said Trunks.  I've got a 
headache...

MISAKA:  This just wasn't nice, SuperGohan.  I still don't know all of the original Tenchi characters!  How am I supposed to relate to two new ones??  <<Listens as the others whisper explainations of what a 'crossover' is.>>  Oh.  Nevermind, then.

JUKEULA:  Okay, fine, this was your first fanfic.  That doesn't mean you can't proofread it.  First, whenever you change speakers you have to change paragraphs.  That's basic grammer.  Second, and I can't believe I'm saying this, put this fic in script format!  It helps to disguise the fact that for every seven lines of dialogue you have one line of description.  Third, and this is important, think about your ideas before you write about them.  Give Ryoko a reason to attack Trunks.  Give Goten a reason to fool around with the time machine.  Give Bulma a reason to build the damn thing in the first place!  I mean, this is...   this is...
