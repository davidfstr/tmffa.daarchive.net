CWA^3 Fan-Fic Depreciation Theater does No Need For Virgins - Part 2: 
"Innocent No More." 

Once again we find ourselves deep in the Cultural Wasteland. It has been 18 months since 
the first experiment.  Since that time, a new member has joined the crew over at the CWAAA 
and Dr. J-chan feels that enough time has passed since his last experiment that he needs to 
annoy his friends again.

+Dr. J-chan walks into a small room with a sign on the door that says "The Lounge of Love."
J-san and Shadow are sitting at a small table playing chess with their limited edition 'Tenchi
Muyo!' holographic chess set.  WhiteRose sits in a big comfy chair reading 'War and Peace:  
The Really Long and Complicated Version."+

Shadow:  +Pushes button and little holographic Aeka pummels the annoying 'Shin Tenchi' girl+
Aeka mallets Sakuya!  Check!

J-san:  +Grins and pushes button so that Ryoko materializes in front of Aeka and delivers the
coup de ta+ Ryoko decapitates Aeka!  Double check and mate sucker! 

+Suddenly the two holographic Ryokos latch onto Tenchi signifying the game's end+

Shadow:  Damn.

+In walks the newest member: Kawaii Girl S+

KGS:  Hey guys!  What's going down in groove town mates? 

J-san:  I Just took game 206 in a row... 

+Suddenly all four of them dematerialize from the lounge and rematerialize inside the old
theatre that looks like J-san's basement.  All four find themselves tied to the couch and 
the large holographic screen has returned+

KGS:  What's going on?!

WhiteRose:  Oh no!  You don't think...?!?

Shadow:  He wouldn't...

+Dr. J-chan appears on the screen with Chibi-me.+

Dr. J-chan: Hello my friends.  It took 18 months, but I found another fic that was pure evil.

J-san:  He would...

Dr. J-chan: So my 'friends,' prepare yourselves.  Once again you will find your minds taxed to
their limits of sanity!  You will never be the same again!

KGS:  What's going on?

WhiteRose:  Oh this happens from time to time.  Dr. J-chan likes to torture us with bad fics.


KGS:  Oh. Um... Why?

WhiteRose:  Because he is an ass.

KGS: Ah. 

Dr. J-chan: Today's experiment is another 'Tenchi Muyo!' lemon.  This time an Aeka gets Tenchi
one.

J-san:  Well... at least it's not that wretched 'No Need for Virgins' fic.  

Shadow:  Yeah, that was just plain sucky. 

Dr. J-chan:  Then you'll love this one even more!  It's 'No Need for Virgins...PART 2!' 

All Four: AAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Dr. J-chan:  Enjoy... BwhahahhahhAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA ha ha HAAAA! 

<Inside his observation lab>

+Dr. J-chan ceases communications, he turns to Chibi-me+

Dr. J-chan:  Are you hungry Chibi-me?  Would you like some Pocky?

+Chibi-me nods excitedly+

Dr. J-chan:  Hey, what does a guy have to do around here to get some /frick'n/ Pocky?!

<Back in the Theatre...>

WhiteRose:  We must be strong!

J-san:  We must resist!

KGS: We must be stupid to allow this!

Shadow:  We must tear this tripe a new one!  

All Four:  BOO-YAH!

And so it came to be This unlike group would become...

THE CWA^3 ANIME FAN-FIC DEPRECIATION SOCIETY THEATER

The players:

Shadow:  The Brainy Sarcastic One
WhiteRose:  The Brainy Sarcastice One
J-san:  The Brainy Sarcastic One
and
Kawaii Girl S:  The Happy Cute One
(Maybe it's not so unlikely of a group afterall...)
and 

The Evil Dr. J-chan, montitoring this whole experience on a hidden silent 
camera... 


+The Trio stare ahead as the room darkens slightly and the fic begins to scroll 
on an a holographic "screen"...+


+Shadow loosens his bonds a bit and gets his arm free. He pulls out a  large electronic 
score board+

J-san:  What is that?

Shadow:  I made it after the last time.  Instead of simply correcting every single error this guy
makes, I will just call out the number and it pops up on the board.  I say we each put in 20 
bucks and we all pick a number.  Who ever gets the closest to the actual number of errors wins!

WhiteRose: put me down for 55 errors.

J-san: 78 errors.

KGS: 107 errors.

Shadow: and I'll take 350 errors!

J-san: I don't think you give this guy enough credit...

Shadow:  I think you give him too much. 


>This is a Tenchi Muyo Hentai/Lemon Fanfic of the wildest 
>type!

WhiteRose:  It features two people having sex! What an incredible concept!  What will
this guy think of next?!


>This is DEFENTLY not for children!
>Wait a sec.....if u were a child any way..
>YOU PROBABLY WOULDNT UNDERSTAND

Shadow:  1! 2!  3!  +Scoreboard adds 3 errors to the total...+

>THIS AT ALL SO WHY IS THERE A 
>"WARNING" IN THE FIRST PLACE???
>------------------------------------------------------------

KGS:  Actually children are more perceptive than one may think as more and more are experimenting
with sex at an earlier age.

WhiteRose:  Yeah, but I bet the author still hasn't experimented with sex at all...

J-san:  Who is still wanted in 23 states for the murder of the English language.

KGS:  However, not by choice.

WhiteRose: +As Tenchi's House+  I can't take it anymore!  All those damn bugs and those
annoying people having sex inside me!

J-san:  Isn't 'Hilly Mountain' a contradiction in terms? 

Shadow:  I'll let it slide.

>   Tenchi was resting on his bed, starring at the ceiling, 

Shadow: 4!

KGS: +As Shinji Ikari+ Must not run away... why am I so worthless... I hate piloting the

experienced that horror...

KGS: Tenchi then pounded on the wall. "Dammit Sasami, if you are going to use your sister's
vibrator, at least keep it down in there! I'm trying to sleep dammit!"

WhiteRose: Well at least she wasn't on a plate of sashimi.

Shadow: 7!

KGS:  and while they were at it, after they threw the cloths away, they got their clothes too.

>Sasami into the back room, where they quickly got dressed,

>  The thoughts excited him. His cock grew harder ever

J-san:  Yeah, I know having sex with a 10 year old girl with my grandfather walking in the room
sure gets me excited... sick jackass!

Shadow: 8!


>*Whats wrong with me!* He thought *I....I can't possibly 
>wanna do it again?*

Shadow: 9! 

J-san:  You know that is getting really annoying...

Shadow:  Moreso than this crap?

J-san:  Well... no.

KGS:  Wait, I'm confused. Is Tenchi saying that he wants to have sex with a 10 year old girl again
or just sex in general again.

WhiteRose: Does it matter, the worst part of the story is yet to come...  



>  The more he though about it, the more he couldn't resist. 

Shadow: 10!

>Yes, he wanted it again, and he wanted it bad. His body 
>desired more pleasure, and he couldn't control it. He stood 
>up in his bed, and he looked at his bedroom door.

KGS: +as the door+  What the hell are you staring at you sick pedophile?!


>*What am I to do? Should I go....go an ask Sasa.....No! I 

Shadow: 11!

J-san:  Are you going to keep doing that the whole fic?  Can't you just keep a silent total?

Shadow:  OK, fine.  Besides, at this rate, I'll be hoarse by the end of the fic.

>can't do that to her again.* His mind raced on.

KGS:  and unfortunately, his mind left his body behind.

WhiteRose: Which explains a lot, don't it?



>    He stood up and rubbed his head, his eyes half open, and 

J-san:  Which head is this pervert talking about? 

>still locked upon his bedroom door. Then, he made up his

>mind. He was going...going for a drink of water. He slowly

Shadow:  But since he was aimless he missed the door completely and smashed into the wall.

>stairway, Ayeka was looking back at him with great surprise.

WhiteRose: +As Ayeka+ What the HELL did you do to my sister you sicko!?!

>"Lord Tenchi?" Ayeka whispered, "What are you doing up so 
>late at night?"

>"Ayeka, what a surprise to see you here." Tenchi smiled. "I 
>was getting some water." He giggled and rubbed his head.

J-san:  Yeah... water... funny... +giggle+ 

Shadow: +As Tenchi+ Yeah...Water... heh heh, I'm so funny... 

>"Water?",Ayeka said softly, " On, Lord Tenchi I can get you 
>some water! Go back in your room now."

<Error Total: 13>

WhiteRose: +As Ayeka+ ...and think about what you did you sick pervert!


>"Uhhh ok Miss Ayeka?', Tenchi said dumbfoundly.
<Error Total: 14>

>  So he slowly turned and reentered his room. He approached 
>his bed and sat down upon it.

>"Wow, I didn't expect to see lady Ayeka out there. What a 
>real coensedence." Tenchi said to himself.

<Error Total: 15> 

KGS: Yeah, what a coincidence!  She only lives there and all...

Shadow:  I Suspect that they won't be using the term 'lady' to describe her much more after
this fic is over. 



>  Without warning Ayeka stormed into his room holding a 
>small glass of water. She was wearing a silk night kimono. 

WhiteRose: +As Aeka+  Here's you water dammit! Now where are you hiding Elian?!?



>She didn't appear to be wearing any undergarments at all. 
>She closed the door and slowly walked over to Tenchi, bent 
>down in front of him, and gave him the water. Tenchi then 
>excepted the water, smiling, while then suddenly catching a

>glimpse of Ayeka cleavage. She smiled at him as he drank the

Shadow:  Oh this must be after 'Tenchi Muyo in Love 2' when Aeka actually HAD cleavage...


>*A damn, no, i can't.......*He thought.

<Error Total: 18>

>  Tenchi then finished the water and put the glass down the

>"Thank you Ayeka." Tenchi whispered.

>"Your Welcome lord Ten...."She was cut short, when Tenchi

<Error Total: 19>

J-san:  Augh!  Tenchi cut her legs off!!

Shadow: I don't think that's what he meant by 'cut short' J...



>Her eyes opened wide with surprise, but she didn't resist 

WhiteRose:  For it was at that moment that Aeka realized that she was in the sequel to
'No Need for Virgins.'

>  Tenchi then began to move his tongue into Ayeka's mouth. 
>She quickly caught on and did the same. Their hands wandered

J-san:  Boy, Tenchi sure is having trouble undoing what is essentially a lightweight

KGS: Doesn't that line only make sense if she was wearing a skirt instead of a kimono?  

Shadow:  Don't look at me, I only nitpick grammar.

>*She didn't wear undergarments after all* He thought.


J-san:  No, she did.  They're just invisible!


>  Ayeka blushed and looked away. Tenchi then took off all 
>his clothes. Ayeka was filled with surprise when she saw 
>Tenchi pull out his hard cock.

KGS:  Um guys... if he took off all his clothes, then where exactly did he pull his 
'hard cock' out from?  Where exactly was he hiding it? 

Shadow:  from between a cock and a hard place?

J-san:  the Hard Cock cafe? 

WhiteRose:  After this over, I'm going to slap both of you into a coma.

>*Oh my God! What's he doing......I..* Her mind raced.

J-san: +As God+  Don't bring me into this! 

>   Spareing no time, Tenchi opened Ayeka's legs. He placed 
>him member before Ayeka's love tunnel.
>Tenchi then began to enter her.

<Error Total: 24>

>"No Tenchi! Not...No!"Ayeka screamed.

Shadow:  For you folks at home, let's review:  Tenchi is not only a pedophile, but 
he is now a rapist too. So how many additioanl years will he be burning in hell for this one?

KGS:  Take 100 years and multiply that by the number of errors in this 'work.'

KGS: Well there are many things she could do...

WhiteRose: Punch him in the balls. 

J-san: Punch him in the face.

Shadow: Claw out his eyes.

>  Tenchi paused when his cock was all in her. He glanced 
>down at Ayeka and grinned. His sexual actions appear to 
>resemble rape than love. This was the first sign, the first 

Shadow: If I may be serious for a moment.  Rape doesn't even come CLOSE to resembling love.  Rape 
is an act of violence and an act of power, exerted over another human. The fact that anyone 
could find eroticism in the concept of rape is seriosly screwed up in the head.

KGS: Get some serious therapy AncientYume. 

>sign that Tenchi loosing his mind; to sex.

<Error Total: 28> 

J-san: No, the first sign was that he agreed to star in this fic.

Shadow:  I swear to God!  If this guy uses the word 'waste' one more time, I'm going to
remove his head from his torso area and then proceed to place excrement down his esophagus.

WhiteRose:  Only in something this trashy could something as abhorrent as RAPE be excused.  

KGS:  Yeah, trust me, Aeka will need serious trauma counseling and years of therapy to overcome
this horrid behavior.

WhiteRose:  Aeka doesn't resist NOT because of great love, but rather of fear of him hurting
her further if she DOES resist.

Shadow:  Drugs!  That's how we can forget this wretching thing!  Who's got some?

KGS:  Now Shadow, you know we can't condone drug use of any kind. 

Shadow:  You're right. I'm sorry. 

KGS:  However, I CAN condone acts of physical violence against the author.

Shadow: I said I 'OWED' him an apology.  I didn't say I actually give him one... I'm not THAT
nice...

+Dr. J-chan appears with Chibi-me on the monitor...+

Dr. J-chan:  Well... how was it?

KGS:  Well, from what I heard, this seems superior to the previous story...

WhiteRose:  Yeah, this time it actually contained a girl of semi-legal consent... 

J-san:  and it looks like those English courses are helping the author tremdously, this one
almost ressembled English... almost.

Shadow:  Best thing was that is was much, much, MUCH shorter than the first one.

SPECIAL BONUS OMAKE PRESENTATION! 

'NO NEED FOR REBUTTALS!' 

Starring:
The Crew of the CWAAA
BoneparteOzaki
and 
A Psychotic Nut!

Hey Guys!  After an 18 months hiatus from doing MST's I decided to briefly come out of 
retirement. You could probably tell I was a little rusty, so if you didn't enjoy it as much as the
first, my apologies. 

I had only done one MST previous to this and I was content to never do another one.  In all honesty
it's not as much fun as one may think and all in all it brings out a bitter and nasty side of my
personality I don't care much for... 

However, something happened.  It took 18 months after I first published the first MST that I
finally recieved some 'hate mail' from a disgruntled fan. Suddenly I felt an inspiration that
wasn't present before. This became a battle of wits! I wouldn't back down from a fight...

Well... 

"Battle of wits" probably isn't the best term to describe what it was.  If it was a battle, in order
to make it fair I would probably have to substitute myself to make it fair to my opponent...

...unfortunately, the tree stump refused.

Anyway, usually before I get my mail these days, the CWAAA takes the time to screen my mail for
me (They're just that nice.) So I'm sure they had much to say...

<Back at the Lounge of Love> 

Dr J-chan:  Hey guys! Mail call!  Into the theatre!

The Trio of J-san, Shadow and WhiteRose groan and file into the basement theatre...

Shadow: Hey guys?  Didn't Dr. J-chan show us that fic in November of '99? 

J-san:  Man, I knew the post office was getting bad with late deliveries, but if
we're only getting this letter now... I mean Geez!  a year and a half to get
this?!

Dr. J-chan:  No, this was actually was sent today, he's just a really slow

HMMMMMMMMMMMMM? 

J-san:  Mabey?  Isn't he that dance music artist?  

Dr. J-chan:  No, you're thinking of Moby.  Hey Shadow, I'm letting you off your
leash.  Sic him!

Shadow:  *Cracks knuckles* Well, there is the obvious spelling error in line
two, which should be "maybe" and second he didn't capitalize any of
the proper nouns. Japanese, Chinese, Tenchi, Sasami, and Tenchi Muyo! should all
be capitalized. Give me my red pen and my batch of frowny stickers... *proceeds
to grade e-mail like a school paper*

>DID IT? I bet it didn't. Because all you want to do is 

J-san:  Oh no!  It's the "Bad Fan-fic author Avenger!  He's here to punish
us! Come fellow evildoers, let us flee!

J-chan:  Actually it did come to my mind. But then I realized that if he were in
fact Chinese or Japanese, the author would have known that a 'typical' Japanese
or for that matter any Asian culture's, breakfast would not consist of Pancakes
and Muffins. 

J-san:  Actually all I want to do is Rock and Roll all night...

all of us. 

J-san:  God bless America where we all get our right to say what we think!  Us
hating this fic and this guys hating us for hating this fic. *Shadow and Dr.
J-chan start humming "My Country Tis of Thee."*

>who they are. BASTARD!

Shadow:  No no no! This is so wrong! If you're going to write a letter to
complain about someone making fun of the way someone else makes grammar errors,
don't send a letter full of them yourself.  

Dr. J-chan:  Yes, the irony-level in here is reaching critical.

Shadow: Second, when you insult someone don't misuse the insult word! 'Bastard'
means "A male child who is without a father, or was born out of
wedlock." J-chan's parents are both quite definately alive and he was born
some 3 years after his brother so obviously he isn't a bastard.  

Dr. J-chan:  Yeah!  The word you were looking for was Asshole!

J-san: or Dickhead!

Shadow: or one of the many other more appropriate curse words.  However, I
wouldn't recommend 'shit,' 'bitch,' or anything with the word 'fuck.' A person
who has done their homework will tear you a new one for misusing them. 

*WhiteRose re-enters with a huge dictionary*

WhiteRose:  Hey guys! I actually found 'Zackrazielstrife' in here! 

Dr. J-chan: Really? What does it mean? 

WhiteRose: "Zackrazielstrife - A type of pain induced by reading a bunch of
whiny bitchings disguised as social critism." 

J-san:  Wow!  That sums up exactly what I was feeling right now!  

Shadow:  Yes, we are definately experiencing Zackrazielstrife right now. 

<Back to BoneparteOzaki> 

So as you can see, I really can't add much more as my friends have pretty much
summed it up nicely for me. However, thank you for the sincere comments and I
wish you luck on your quest to fight for bad authors everywhere. I'm sure you'll
find plenty of them and their tormentors at the TMFFA. 

Boneparteozaki - Asshole at large

PS - it recently came to my attention that the author of said fic updated it and
corrected a lot of errors from the first version and I looked and indeed he did
fix a lot of errors, however he didn't fix teh biggest ones: 1. There still
wasn't much of a plot, and 2. It still sucks.

spoofing the whole point of the letter...

Shadow:  We can't get lives!  We're fictional!

<Once again back to BoneparteOzaki for his commentary...>

Thanks for your entertaining letters, I haven't laughed this hard in months.  I
think I'm going to call you my new best friend. 

BoneparteOzaki - Fictional Character with no life

PS - I've recieved various letters of the last 18 months about that MST and it
seems that the concensus is that "NO need for Virgins" does indeed
suck. I can't go against the public opinion can I?

<The next day...>

*Dr. J-chan walks in with some diskettes.  Shadow has his feet propped up on the
table and is enjoying the latest issue of "FAN-FICS THAT SUCK
MAGAZINE." On the cover it says "Featuring part 12 of 23 in our series
on why 'No Need for Virgins' sucks. 

Dr. J-chan: Hey guys, we got more mail.  Into the theatre with you three.

The Trio:  Ah Geez, AGAIN?!

Dr. J-chan: Don't give me no sass!  On with it!  Shoo!

*The three file into the theatre...*

*Dr. J-chan appears.  Suddenly the set shifts to a copy of the set of the
"McLauglin Group." 

Dr. J-chan:  Such a serious question demands a serious answer.  It is time for
another one of our panel discussions. Issue number 1: No Need for Virgins; Why
does it suck?  Shadow?

Shadow:  First I like to say that Sasami lemons don't make us angry, but
horribly written stories of any kind are just unforgivable.  

Dr. J-chan:  Point. 

Shadow:  Now I think the biggest reason I think this story sucks is the annoying
and constant practice of using 'waste' instead of 'waist.' I can understand bad
spelling, but please!  This is particularly disgusting with lines like
"Tenchi placed his hand on her waste." Is he placing his hand on her
thigh or is Tenchi a nasty fecalphiliac?!?

J-san:  Fictional or not, the character is 10 YEARS OLD! If your personal
fantasies consist of 17 year old wussboys molesting 10 year girls on their
kitchen tables, then you have many personal issues to deal with.  Please, seek
help. 

WhiteRose:  Tired, tired plotline, if you can call it that.  C'mon, 'parents go
away; underage children get it on?' Bleah! If you are going to inflict a fan fic
like this on the general populace, and if you are not going to use at least
somewhat intelligible language, then at least give us something ENTERTAINING!
Not only did this fic suck, but it was boring to boot. 

Dr. J-chan:  Those are all good points. Here's my final words on the topic.
Besides the horrible grammar and lack of a intelligible plot of some sorts, the
author shows a complete lack of understanding on many concepts of human
sexuality, a complete lack of understanding on the foreign culture which he is
writing about, and a complete lack of understanding about the established
characters he is writing about.  In summary:  It sucked.

J-san:  It sucked hard.

Shadow:  It sucked long.

WhiteRose:  It sucked with commitment 

All four:  IT SUCKED! GET OVER IT!

<BoneparteOzaki finally gets his mail...>

Hello again. Boy, the guys seemed to be in rare form lately, it nice to give
them work again.

You will be happy to know how much joy your letters have been bringing, not only
to me, but to my friends whom the characters are based on in real life. They
have been laughing almost as hard as I have these days and tehy enjoy them so
much they even helped contribute to this edition of the letter to you. All of us
here just want to say "You bring us so much joy, and so much laughter...and
oh yeah, 'No Need for Virgins' still sucks.

and so it seems that the fun had to end sometime.  Maybe he realized that he wasn't going to change my mind.  Or maybe he just learned that you can't send a hate mail to a MST author.  We're ALWAYS looking for material... 

Anyway, if you are like me and you thought that the 'No Need for Virgins' series did indeed suck, then please send a mail to Zackrazielstrife@cs.com.  Only by making yourself heard will this poor misguide soul grasp that 'No Need for Virgins' does what it always has... suck. 

On that note, I end this exercise in verbal assault and battery. A special thanks to all those people who sent me e-mails telling me how much they enjoyed the first MST and a extra special thanks to Zackrazielstrife@cs.com who brought me out of retirement.
