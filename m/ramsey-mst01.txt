Well. With that said...



Rick Ramsey slowly opened his eyes, only to be greeted by darkness.
Groggily, he tried to sit up, and the dull thumping in his head
increased to an incredibly painful headache. "Urgk," he said. Then,
after a few more seconds of contemplation, "Whoooorrr." He looked
around, but still could not make out anything.
"Whoa. I'm so hung over, I can't even remember when I got drunk like
this." He squinted, but to no avail. It was still pitch dark.
"Incorrect," a voice stated. "You are merely experiencing the
aftereffects of the paralysis that has been inflicted upon you to
prepare you for transport. On behalf of those responsible, I
apologize."

"Huh?" Rick was thoroughly confused.

"Welcome to the Fan Fiction Reviewing Complex. Startup
sequence initiated."
Suddenly, lights flashed on, and Rick's eyes went wide.



		- hand crafted reality productions -
				  PRESENTS



Rick was standing in some kind of dome. There was a wide arrangement
of flowers and plants, small trees, and even a water fountain on a
large platform in the middle of the room. The floor was carpeted in
dark blue, and as Rick looked up at the dome, it lit up and displayed
a starry sky. It was pretty impressive, although he didn't recognize
the formations. "This is the lounge," he was told by the voice. "You
will be given a complete tour through the Reviewing Complex as soon as
Startup is completed."
Rick gawked, then shrugged, and sat down on one of the couches
which were standing nearby.



		- THE AMAZING MSTs OF RICK RAMSEY -



"Basic Startup completed. Loading personality for user interaction."
After a few seconds, another voice spoke. "Hello hello! I'm still the
same old machine, but you can call me Seth now. I'm the user
interface personality for the Reviewing Complex, and you can ask me
whenever you need help in here. Now, I think you might want to know
why yo-"
"What I want to know is, WHERE THE HECK AM I?!" Shouted Rick, jumping
up from the couch.
"Well, you're inside the FFRC, the Fan Fiction Reviewing Complex.
That's all I can tell you right now. Your job will be to review fan
fiction. The data we get from your reviews is very important to us,
although I can't tell you what it's used for right now, because your
access level isn't high enough. BUT it is higher than the access level
of your fellow reviewers, so as long as you don't ask about anything
you shouldn't know, I will happily provide you with knowledge and
accept your commands as superior to the others. Basically, you're the
boss here, save for the fact that you won't be allowed to leave - yet.
Don't panic, you're stuck here, but this place was especially designed
for long stays. It's really comfy, you'll see. Anymore questions?"

"Uuhhh... well... okay... wait. Others? Fellow reviewers? I don't see
anybody here!"

"That's right, because they haven't arrived yet. There was no need to
paralyze them, because they're kind of used to stuff like matter
transport and abductions - they're anime characters."

"Right. Anime. Are you telling me that you just go and pull anime
people out of your sleeve?"

"They're not real in- ah... I think this is above your clearance.
Sorry, but you'll have to trust me on this. Please report to
Transportation now, the others will be arriving soon."

A sign popped up in the air next to him, and he followed the arrow
depicted on it.



		- EPISODE ONE: ABDUCTED, BUT LIKING IT -



Rick stepped through the high sliding door labeled "Transportation"
and entered a large chamber. It was dark, but Rick could clearly make
out six booths illuminated by white light, arranged in a half circle.
In the middle of the half circle was a panel, displaying obscure data.
Facing the panel, between the first three and the last three booths,
there was a tall black structure which was emitting a low hum.
Suddenly, the panel flashed, and Seth made an announcement.
"Prepare for arrival."
The first three booths began to hum, and with a flash, each one filled
with blue-white light. Out of the light stepped three figures.
"Greetings. My name is Kamidake. Nice to meet you." He walked over
and shook hands with Rick, who was stupefied.
"Rally Vincent, Fanfic Reviewer!" The girl held up a badge and
grinned, before walking over to the other two.
"Hey there. Ryo Saeba's the na... Hello!" In an instant, the infamous
Stud of Shinjuku was beside Rally and had grabbed one of her hands.
"Rally Vincent, right? It's a real pleasure to meet you." He grinned
broadly.
"Ahem." Interrupted Seth, although he didn't really need to clear his
throat - mostly because he didn't have one. "Please follow the signs
for a tour through the Complex." Another holographic arrow popped up,
and after Rally had pulled her hand from Ryo's grip (much to his
disappointment), they walked out of the chamber.
After a few minutes, they had been introduced to three of the four
areas branching off from the lounge - Transportation, Science and
Quarters. The Transportation chamber was used to bring in or send away
MSTers and guests, since Rick was the only one who was unable to
leave the Complex. Science consisted of a couple laboratories and a big
library, and Quarters were the living quarters and recreational
facilities. The tour was rather short, because they would be able to
explore everything on their own later.
"Well, I'll give it to you, the place is not that bad," Rick commented.



"This is the Reviewing Theater," Seth explained once the group had
stepped through the last remaining door that lead away from the lounge.
"The fanfics we need you to review will be shown here."
The theater was a large hall, looking mostly like an ordinary cinema.
However, a row of seats was separated from the others, and the stairs
leading to it were illuminated in diffuse light. The ambient music
playing in the background hinted towards a really impressive sound
system, although they could not make out where the speakers where.
"This theater was built for ultimate viewing comfort... it's what
you see on the screen that might make you uncomfortable. Go on, try
the seats!" Ignoring the chuckling computer, the group made their
way to the seats and sat down.
"Comfy?" Asked Seth.
"Indeed." Said Kamidake.
"Yep, not bad. What's this?" Rick indicated the box that was mounted
to the underside of his seat.
"For lack of a better term, it's called a Hammerspace Connector.
You can pull things from it, and put them away, like drinks or
snacks. It reacts to your thoughts, or something. I can't really
tell you how to use it, it's a thing only humans can do. Just try,
you'll get the knack after a few times."
While Ryo, Kamidake and Rick were fooling around, producing various
objects, but not quite what they intended, Rally leaned back.
"Nice," she commented. That got Ryo's attention. He leered at her,
thought a little, and suddenly started giggling without obvious reason.
Rally shot him a strange look and was just about to ask him what was so
funny, when Seth interrupted. "So, you like it? Good. Because I think
it's time for your first job!"
The door slammed shut, and the screen flickered to life.

RALLY:  No duh.
(Ryo leers briefly at Rally, and mutters something to himself.)

KAMIDAKE:  So it is acceptable if she dates her boyfriend, but
	it is not when her sister does the same?
RICK:  There's a difference.
KAMIDAKE:  Where?
RICK:  Her sister is on a dumb ass date with her boyfriend, while
	Jessica is 'dating' her boyfriend, who is a dumb ass.
RYO:  And sexually frustrated.

> Jessica walks over to her and came out wearing a laced black

>

RYO:  Very sexually frustrated.
KAMIDAKE:  And female, apparently... or, it MIGHT be that the
	author lets his pronouns slip. And his tenses. And his
	spelling.

KAMIDAKE:  I think we should keep jokes about genitalia to a minimum.
RALLY:  Spoilsport.
KAMIDAKE:  Well, it's rude, and there might be people under 18 reading
	this.
(A chime is heard.)
SETH:  Actually, since this is a MST of a lemon fanfiction, there
	should be no one under 18 reading this, OR the fic. The author
	of the fic forgot to point that out.
RICK:  Heh. Maybe somewhere an enraged mother decides to sue him.

RYO:  "Defy-gravity"... is that a proper adjective?
RICK:  The fun in English is that you can easily make up words.
	Like "interfeezible", for example.
RYO:  And that means?
RICK:  I don't know, I just made it up.

KAMIDAKE:  So how come he can see the pictures when the screen is
	invisible?

RICK:  Washu is talking to herself?

> "But before you leave David, I have to do something to you." Said

RYO:  At this point, I'd like to state again that the author is
	severely sexually frustrated.
RALLY:  What is it with you and sexual frustration?
RYO:  I believe that sexual frustration is one of the great
	evils of the world. It is my sacred duty to fight it.
	If you ever need help because you're sexually frustrated,
	call me. I'll be glad to help you.
(Ryo grins broadly. He stops grinning, however, as Rally elbows him
in the gut - hard.)
RYO:  OOF!
RALLY:  So THAT'S it! Don't even TRY!

RYO:  Right. Huge. Incredibly, breathtakingly huge.
RICK:  Ha! She's in her child form, so... wait a minute.
	Child form? Urgk.
MST GROUP:  ERK!
(Kamidake, Rick and Rally produce vomit bags from under their seats.
Ryo pulls out an empty popcorn bucket, looks at it, and shrugs.)
RYO:  Anyway, that guy is sick.
KAMIDAKE:  And he can't stick to a tense.

KAMIDAKE:  But Washu was annoyed by his screaming, and slapped

(The others eye Kamidake wearily.)
KAMIDAKE:  So I need some training in making cracks at bad fan
	fiction. It's not easy, I was dead for a few centuries!
And Juraian knights are no entertainers to begin with!

RALLY:  Then he died from dehydration.

>
> "What's this?" asked David.

> "Its the super duper lust power pill invented by me little

RICK(Washu):  It's great! It's my greatest achievement yet!
	Now, on to my next experiment! The Hentai-Ray!
	After that, I will finally complete the Mega-Aphrodisiac!
	And then, it's time for the Super Passion Shot!
	Hmmmmm. I have the strangest feeling of deja vu.
KAMIDAKE:  What was that about?
RICK:  Have you ever noticed that in a hell of a lot of lemons
	out there, Washu ALWAYS goes and invents some kind of
	drug that makes people horny? Talk about overused plots.
KAMIDAKE:  That's true. Especially if you consider the fact
	that her favorite experiments are weapons of mass
	destruction, or robots.

> "All you have to do is kiss Ryoko and shove this down her throat 
> with your tongue." Explained Washu.
>

RALLY(Washu):  It's easy, really. Just don't think about the fact
	that she's a super powerful space pirate who has already
	ravaged and plundered several entire planets all by
	herself, and that she moves so fast that you won't see her
	hand moving before she chops your head off.

> "Okay... I think I can do that." Said David as he grasped the

RYO(David):  I'll just stun her with my looks and my amazing
	charm, before she can think of doing anything.

>
> "Oh there is another thing... you have to keep her busy for at

RICK(David):  But I don't know if I can run for that long!

KAMIDAKE:  Again, the author hat lost his grip on the tenses. And
	on quotes and parentheses, to boot.

> "Who the fuck are you? Asked Ryoko.
>
> "Never mind that, all you need you to know is my name." Said the 
> mysterious teen.

RALLY:  Mysterious. Uuuhhh. I'm so frightened and mystified by this
	mysterious and extremely horny boy.
RYO:  There there. I'll hold you. *WHAP* Ouch!
RALLY:  Back off!

>
> "And that is?" Asked Ryoko.
>
> "David." Said David.
>

RICK:  David. David McClutterbuckle-Warnitzky. Hey! What're you
	laughing at?!

(Ryo looks thoughtful for a moment, then reaches under his seat and
pulls a piece of candy out of Hammerspace. He unwraps it and pops
it into his mouth.)
RYO:  Rally, I want to test something here. I need your assistance
	in this experiment. Would you help me? (Rally hits him over
	the head.) *WHACK* OUCH!
RALLY:  I said, BACK OFF!

> "What the fuck was that thing?" asked Ryoko.
>
> "Wait a minute and you'll find out." said David.
> Suddenly Ryoko was trembling in ecstasy.  She violently started 
> to shake and then out of no where her body splitted into two different 
> people.  
>

KAMIDAKE:  Strange. The real Ryoko would have trembled with rage
	instead of ecstasy, would have violently pummeled David
	instead of shaking, and would then have split HIS body in
	two, not hers. She has devoted herself to Tenchi, after
	all... and she is NOT known for her politeness.

> (This is too good to be true.) Thought David.
> 
> Both of the Ryoko's stood up and put their arms around him.
>
> "How am I supposed to tell each other apart?" Asked David.
>
> One of the Ryoko's put her finger into her hair and it went 
> black.
>
> "Call me Ryoko-Chan." Said the black hair Ryoko.

RALLY:  Ryoko-chan, because I'm WAY cuter than she is. We
	are the same, but I'm cuter. Go figure.
RICK:  Well, "Ryoko-chan" is better than "Ryoko's double
	who made her hair go black".
RALLY:  That doesn't make it less stupid.
RICK:  What's so wrong with "Ryoko-chan"?
RALLY:  I don't know. For some reason, it irks me.

>
> "Well what about me and you two go up stairs and have some fun."  
> Implied David.
>
> "YAHHHH!" Yelled Ryoko.
>

RICK:  Huh? She actually thought for a moment, and decided to
	scream and run away?

> "ME TOO!" Screamed Ryoko-Chan.
>

RICK:  All right! This fic can still be saved!
KAMIDAKE:  No, but we can still control the damage.

> Both Ryoko's lead David upstairs to their room and the door 
> closes behind them.

MST GROUP:  Darn.
RYO:  Does Ryoko have a room?
KAMIDAKE:  No.
RYO:  Ah.

> Both of the Ryoko's removed their clothes and all 
> David does is sit down and ahs at the two humanoid beauties.  Ryoko-
> Chan dropped down on her knees and unzips his pants.  
>

RALLY:  Then she laughed so hard that she died.
KAMIDAKE:  You made that joke already.
RALLY:  Sorry, sorry.
RYO:  Besides, it was described above as "average sized".
RALLY:  And how do you know that he's honest?
RYO:  Well, how do you know that he isn't?
RALLY:  Are you defending the author?
RYO:  I'm defending the male gender in general.
RALLY:  Is that so.
RYO:  It is. If you have anymore questions or if you
need any physical proof, meet me in my quarters 
after we're done wi- *SLAP! POW!* OW! OWIEE!
RALLY:  Grrrr!

> "Before I give you some head how about some tit fucking?" Asked 
> Ryoko-Chan.
>
> "Okay, I've never tried that before." Said David.
>
> "There's always a first time for everything." Said Ryoko from 
> behind Dave.
>

RICK:  Great. Another lemon scene coming up.
RALLY:  At least Ryo should be happy, then.
RYO:  Believe it or not, but these here make me sick. Kind of.

> Ryoko-Chan laded down on the floor and rubbed some baby oil all

> "Hey stop tonguen me and just use the four finger approach." Said 
> Ryoko-Chan.
>
> "Gotta." Replied Ryoko.
>

RALLY(Ryoko):  Gotta go, I meant. Bye!

> Ryoko pulled her tongue away shoves her four right fingers inside

>

KAMIDAKE:  Somehow, that didn't sound right.

> "Get ready I'm gonna..." murmured David.
>
> Ryoko-Chan opened her mouth as much as she could as Dave blew cum

>

RALLY:  Yuck, I say.

> "Hey I want some of that stuff too, David." Wined David.
>

RICK:  Okay, hold it. Was David just talking to himself, saying
	that he wanted his own sperm?
OTHERS:  Rick!!

> David pulls out his dick from in between Ryoko-Chan's breast and

RALLY:  Heh heh heh heh heh.
OTHERS:  What?
RALLY:  I just got a really gross mental image.
RYO:  About what?
RALLY:  About the sentence we just saw. It involves an axe and fire.
(The guys wince and cross their legs. Then, their faces become
slightly green.)
KAMIDAKE:  Gross, indeed.
RICK:  I think I'm gonna puke.

> while Ryoko-Chan was getting her pussy eaten inside and out by Dave.  
> Ryoko still keep going with an impressive blowjob during all of this.

> "Come on Dave, just a little bit more." Moaned Ryoko-Chan.

> Ryoko-Chan orgasm melts all over Dave's face and at about the

> 

RYO:  Then, Dave fell to the ground and died, because his face
	was molten. Ryoko choked and died, too. As soon as the
	super lust pill wore off, Ryoko-chan committed suicide.
	The End.

> "Ryoko, could you please lay on the ground for me." Asked David.
>
> "No problem." Said Ryoko.
>

RYO(David):  And could you touch your nose with your tongue for me?

> Ryoko lies on the ground and Dave lifted her legs into mercenary

>
> "Hey, what can I do?" exclaimed Ryoko-Chan.
>

RICK:  Kill David, and end the fic!

> "I got an idea, Ryoko-Chan dig into the bottom of my top dresser

>

RICK:  So, Ryoko-Chan proceeded to dig into the bottom of the
	top dresser drawer. After a few hours, she hit oil.

> Ryoko-Chan walks over to the dresser and digs up a strap on

>
> "Now strap that thing on and shove it into my ass." Demanded 
> Ryoko.
>
> Ryoko-Chan straps on the dildo and David lifts up Ryoko and 
> Ryoko-Chan slides on under her and glides the dildo inside her tight

KAMIDAKE:  That's quite an impressive sentence. Or it would be, if
	quantity counted.

> Dave and Ryoko-Chan started into a painful and pleasurable

>
> "David, get ready..." moaned Ryoko.
>
> "Meeeeeeeee tooooo...." Yelled Ryoko-Chan.
>
> "Here I.... CCCCCCCCCCUUUUUUUUUUMMMMM!" Screamed David.
>

RICK:  And again, he screams.
RALLY(Ryoko):  Dammit, Dave! My ears are ringing! Why don't
	you follow Ryoko-Chan's example, and learn to yell
	quietly?

> Ryoko dug her fingernails into Dave's back as each one of them 
> blows their loads of cunt honey and cum. 
>

RYO:  How poetic.

> "Hey I want to get fucked too, you know." Wined Ryoko-Chan.
>
> The opening of the door cut off David.
>
> "Who the fuck are you?" demanded Ryoko.
>
> "Jesse?" questioned David.
>

MST GROUP:  Who?!

> "Washu was right on which place to go to." Said Jesse.
>
> "HUH?" gasped both of the Ryoko's.
>
> "Never mind, now who wanted to get fucked?" asked Jesse.
>

(Rick groans.)
RICK:  Right. Just when the few ideas you had start running out,
	throw in another random character who the reader knows
	nothing about, just to keep the action going.
RYO:  Heh. "Action".
RICK:  You know what I meant. Anyway, this is just pointless.
KAMIDAKE:  The entire fic is rather pointless, like so many

SETH:  All right, MST's done! You may leave the theater. Report
	to the Lounge for group assessment, please.



The MST group was sitting or lying on the couches in the lounge.
"That went rather well, for our first MST," said Kamidake.
"Yeah, but there's certainly room for improvement," added Ryo.
"Come on, it was not that bad. But we need to improve our
teamwork and weirdness," said Rick.
"Weirdness?!" Rally stared at Rick.
Seth beeped. "Your opinions of the fic, please, so we can
wrap this up, and call it a day."

"Okay, here's mine," said Rick. "I think the fic is rather
pointless, what with the total absence of a real plot and
all. It sucks, because it doesn't lead anywhere.
It's just mindless drivel."
"Yep. I think the author wrote it mainly to boost his ego.
There are worse lemons out there, but I didn't enjoy this
one, I can tell you," added Rally.
"The language was not so good, either," Kamidake opined,
"there were jumps between tenses, bad grammar, and the
author didn't use a spell check."
"The lemon scenes were crappy. Really crappy." That was
Ryo, of course. "I could do better. For example, if 
Rally would just let me- OW!" A resounding WHAP echoed
through the Lounge. "NO, I WON'T! I'm going to my
quarters. Can anybody show me the way?"
"Of course." Seth let an arrow pop up. "Do you want
anything else?" - "Well, you don't have any kind of
Saeba Repellant, I suppose."

"You'd be surprised." With that, a holographic screen
depicting various combat weapons popped up and floated
in front of Rally while she made her way out of the
Lounge, headed for Quarters. "The matter generators
of the Complex can generate all kinds of useful tools."
"I see." Rally's giggling faded out as she left the room.

"HEY! Is this a conspiracy, or something?" Ryo looked
angry. "I'm here to provide you with information, help,
and tools," Seth responded, "so I did."
"Oh yeah? Give me an exact map of the quarters then,
with Rally's in extra detail!"
A schematic view of the quarters materialized in front
of him. "I can't believe that worked. Heh heh heh heh.
HEH HEH HEH HEH! Ahem. I'm in Science. Don't disturb!"
With that, Ryo dashed off, chuckling to himself.

"I wonder..." Rick mused, staring after Ryo. "Well.
I'm off to bed. You coming, Kamidake?"
"Lead the way."
"Seth, could you point us to our quarters?"
Following the arrows, they were led through Quarters
until they reached the hallway that contained the
private rooms. Each inhabitant of the Complex had
one, and there were spare rooms for guests and MSTers
yet to come. "Maybe we could invite a guest next time,"
wondered Rick aloud. "Whatever you wish," said Seth.
"Remember, basically, you're the boss here."
"Yeah. Basically. Night, Kamidake."
"Good night to you, too."
Rick entered his room and looked around. There was
furniture, but nevertheless, it looked rather empty
and sterile. 'Gotta change that tomorrow,' thought
Rick, and plopped down on the bed. 'After all, it
wouldn't be THAT bad to stay here for a longer
time...'


Until next time!

 - AUTHOR'S NOTES -
Well, that was my first MST. Sorry for the long introduction,
but I wanted to be thorough. Rick Ramsey is NOT a self-insertion.
He's author created, but he's not me. I'm no fan of SI, mainly
because I think it seems arrogant and stupid... unless you
can pull it off really well, like for example the great Peter 
Suzuki (bows).

Want to drop a comment? Think I was too soft on the author in
my assessments? Did I make a mistake somewhere? Tell me!
Constructive Criticism is always welcome.

Mail me at: hcr@zardian.de

.de? Yes, I'm German. So, if my English sucks, tell me that,
too! Until next time!
