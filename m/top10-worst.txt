AUTHOR’S NOTES:

I decided to write this after I had a REALLY bad day.  I pray that none of
these things mentioned here are actually made (I can assure you that number2
will NEVER happen, although I may post up the list itself one day, ifanyone
asks.), and that all of you reading this will heed this warning;Nothing good
would ever come from these listed things coming true.  Thank you, and good
night!

Peter Suzuki.
