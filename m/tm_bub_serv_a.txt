<Demon>Hi,today all of you little kids are going to learn,with the help of

::Demon and her camera man,err,I mean werewolf enter the Pioneer Animation 
locker rooms,where they find Ryoko placing a green block of weed in a locker::

<Demon>Wow here we have the utmost popular charecter in the Tenchi Universe,

<Ryoko>First off,kid,who are you and where are you from::hides a joint::

<Demon>::eyes the joint::Umm my name is Demon and i'm from the mst ship,
The Bandit,and I was assigned a project in order to get extra tv time..

<Ryoko>Ohh,hell,why did'nt you say so?Okay well I think drugs are perfectly 
fine..you can never have to many::sighs and pulls bags of cocaine out of the locker and dashes off with it::

::Demon then makes her way over to the weight room,where she spies 
Princess Ayeka::

<Ayeka>And who would you be?

<Demon>I'm Demon and I need to know what you think of drugs...

<Ayeka>::imitates Mr.Mackey::Drugs are bad..dont do drugs..drugs are bad

::Demon and her camera werewolf slowly slide through the door to the jacuzzi,while
Ayeka pulls a puppet out of her dufflebag::

<Demon>::leaps into the water beside a teal haired woman and a blonde::Okay,
Mihoshi and Kiyone,I take it?

<Mihoshi>You would be correct!::hands Demon a cookie::

<Kiyone>::sighs and rolls her eyes::And who would you be?
 
<Demon>::watches as the cookie grows green legs and runs away::My name is Demon
I need to know what you two think of drugs?::points to the camera::for the kiddies
in tv land.

<Kiyone>Well I think anyone with grugs should be punished!::slams her fist into the palm of her hand::

<Mihoshi>But Kiyone!Yesterday you and Ryoko were smoking..hmfmfmfm::Kiyone slams a hand over Mihoshi's mouth
and pushes her underwater::

<Kiyone>::Drowning Mihoshi::Die!Die!Die!

<Demon>Okay!!!!!::Gets out of the water and goes into the lunch room::

::As Demon pulls out her bottle prozac and proceeds to down the whole bottle,
a young man approaches her::

<Tenchi>Umm hello miss...what are you doing?

<Demon>::points a shaking finger to the camera::Showing the kids that drugs are bad!

<Tenchi>::lights a joint and takes a puff::Yes..::cough::Drugs are really,umm bad!

<Sasami>::pokes her head out of a small room::Hello!I can tell you what I think of
drugs!

<Demon>Yes what is it?

<Sasami>Well,I think drugs are yucky and only bad people do them..

<Demon>::pats Sasami on the head::Good,finally someone sane...

::Then Demon walks over to little Washu as Sasami shuts the door and flushing 
sounds can be heard::

<Washu>Hello,how may i help you?

<Demon>Well Washu,what do you think about drugs?

<Washu>Well im not telling you jack-shit until you call me little Washu!

<Demon>Okay,umm,little Washu,what do you think of drugs?::spies the beekers and 
needles::

<Washu>Why?Do you know someone who wants to buy some?

<Demon>::Sighs::Sure how much...

<Washu>::pulls off her mask revealing an FBI agent::Your under arrest for 
drug trafficing!

::Two men then grab Demon from behind and proceed to drag her off::

<Demon>But I..I..didnt..I mean..ohh bloody hell...

::We see Demon back on the SS.Bandit with the crew::

<Psyco>::pats her on the back::Dont worry,Uhsaw says you get probation in 2000 more years...
