It may be best if you download it and read it on your HD.

This is my 4th MSTing, and my first multi-part one. I have decided to make a
real good MSTing here....no matter how long it takes! I totally screwed up on
this thing a couple of times but I did it! Now I can sit down, watch Crow T.
Robot say 'Bite Me' and/or Tenchi Muyo in Love. Lets get to it!

But First......

Sattelite of Love, 4:35:26 EST
	The Sattelite of Love was odd and quiet this day. Crow and Tom were in the
holocabana while Mike was doing something near the movie sign area. So Iria
decided to take the tour of this ship and just walked around. 

	Gypsy was cleaning up a small section of the ship and happened to see Iria
walk around the bend near her. She has seen her several times, yet she has never
really said hi or anything. So she took this as a chance to do so.
	"Uhh... Hi" said Gypsy, walking up to Iria. "I'm Gypsy"
	"Hey!" said Iria. "The names Iria."
	"So your the new gal huh?" asked Gypsy.
	"Yeah... I guess" replied Iria simply. "What do you do around here while we
are in the movie theater anyway?"
	"I just play around the HoloCabana thing or clean around." said the purple
almost vaccum.
	"Uhh..." Iria started, "I've heard a lot about the HoloCabana, but I've
actually never seen it yet. What do those bots do in there?"
	"Come and I'll show you!" Gypsy replied as she guided her to the
HoloCabana. And this was probably the wrong time to do so. Along the way, Iria
noticed a small initial with something about 6.7 on it.
	Crow and Tom where in there as their fantasies with girls. And I am not
going into detail about it. Tom was with one and Crow was with one as well.
	"Well, thanks for your time, Mrs. Apple" said Crow.
	"Anytime, sweetheart" said the holographic Fiona Apple. While everything
wasn't real on the SOL's HoloCabana, Crow took it to be real. Around this time,
Gypsy turned on a monitor that shows what is happening to the outside of the
chamber. Iria peeked into it.
	"Why...those Hentai's" smierked Iria.
	"Yep... this is what they do 99% of the time in there" said Gypsy, hitting
a button that went to Cam 2. This cam showed Tom Servo with another gal.
	" WHAT THE? How can I program something in there?" asked Iria.
	"Simple, just say it on this microphone" Gypsy replied, pulling out a small
microphone, alot like the ones you saw in the Empire Strikes Back (You know like
in the Cloud City scenes where Lando uses the small mic to evacuate the city?).
	"Allright, I want..." she started as Gypsy turned to cambot.
	"We'll be right back people," said Gypsy.
[Commercial Sign]
********************************************************************************
********************************

[Commercial Scene: Graveyard]
Narriator: Are you tired of messy funerals? Just look at the ground
[Camera shows body parts coming out of the ground]
Narriator: If you are tired of these funerals, come to McDonalds and have a
Apple Pie.
[A-ko comes onto the scene for no reason]
A-ko: What the HELL does McDonalds have to do with Funerals?
Narritor: Well, it's a simple deal: You eat our special 99 cents apple pie and
you get full funeral arrangements!
A-ko: But....
Narriator: Act Now, before this deal is gone!
A-ko: Thats it!! 
[A-ko punches out the camera and grabs the Narritor beside the camera guy. She
does several wrestling moves and knocks him out. A-ko then just walks away.]
********************************************************************************
********************************

     "There" said Iria. "That should teach those bots."
     "What are you gonna do to them" finnally asked Gypsy.
	"Pure Torture until they get out of the chamber" smerked Iria.
	Iria was right.  Both Crow's and Servo's 'Holo' gal morphed into Barbra
Striesand.
	"AHHH!" as if by simultanious yelled the two bots. Then, suddenly, a
'Holographic' version of Iria apperared.
	"What did you do, Iria" asked Crow. Holo Iria said nothing. Instead, she
aimed a Z-1 gun from 5th Element at them. She aimed and hit the Flame Thrower
button. 
			End of HoloProgram.....
	Crow and Servo came running out of the room coughing. 
	"Damnit, Iria!" said Servo. "Why did you do that?" asked Servo, pretty much
pissed off.
	"To teach you guys a lesson" replied Iria.
	"You guys deserved it" added Gypsy.
	The red Light flashed. The 3, Iria, Crow, and Servo went on.
	"Oh, By the way, thanks" said Iria, stopping and turning around.
	"No prob" replied Gypsy. Iria continued to run toward the main deck.
	Mike was already there and talking to Dr.F. And he knew something was up
with Dr.F with his odd smile.
	"So...how about you go first with the invention exchange, Doc?" asked Mike.
	"Nono, I insist that you go first, Mike." said the Diabolical Doc.
	"Well, allright." Iria and the two bots came running in. "Hey guys. What
happened to you two" He said while looking at Crow and Servo.
	"It's a long story" said Crow. "Let's say the invention now." Iria held up
a small device that was on a small keychain.
	"This is the mini-hardrive" replied Mike. "We know how people wish they
could take more than 1 ioMega disk full of stuff, so we made this thing. What it
does is that you put this into a disk drive and you get 1 terabyte of memory."
	"A small advance" said Dr.Forrester. "Now my invention is called the Ultima
Weapon. I stole the name from FF7, but who cares!?! This invention goes on your
computer and you can blast any person on America Offline through a small laser
through the modem. Also, it can be fired as a Ki Blast at a unexpecting
victim!!"
	"Don't remind us on Ki Blasts" said Servo
	"Well, I'll explain what I'm doing with it later. Here is your next
Diabolical Scheme to make you Crazy!! It's called Armageddon Prophecy by Pyrous.
Good Luck!! MWHAHA"
	"Screw you..." said Iria. The yellow light flashed before she could say
anything else.
	"WE GOT FANFIC SIGN" shouted Mike entering the theater with the others.

Crow: (Tenchi) I gotta get something in Ryoko's room...
Mike and Iria: CROW!!!
Tom: He would never try to do that..... would he?
Iria: Offstage maybe.

>  As every one ate little did they know of the experience
>about to unfold.

Mike: Tenchi had a full house and Sasasmi was needing a Ace...
Iria: You know,  Ryoko just had to fold...you can never unfold in Poker. Well
That full house also helped in it.

>  Ryoko came running down at a lightning speed in her bath
>robe screaming.

Tom: (Ryoko) They took my Pantene Pro V!

>"My god, you guys there is burglar in the house!" said Ryoko abnormally
>frightened as she interrupted everyone's small talk.

Iria: Couldn't Ryoko FRY the burglar?
Crow: Then there wouldn't be a plot.

>"A Burglar!" everyone at the table said in unison.
>"Yes, and he's got Mihoshi!!!" Ryoko said.

Mike: If you say anything, Crow...
Crow: What?
Mike: Same to you, Tom.
Tom: What?

>"What's up?" 

Mike: The sky...
Iria: Taxes...
Crow: Movie Budgets...
Tom: The Trash Dump this fanfic is on....

>Mihoshi asked coming into the room with a man with oddly cut blue

Crow: Bill Clinton?
Mike: No... Bill Clinton has white hair and has too many *other* scars...
Crow: Oh....EWW!!

>"What the?" Aeyka said, "Ryoko, this burglar of yours is in A GALAXY POLICE
>UNIFORM!!!"

Mike: (Ryoko) EXACTLY!!

>"I was groggy," Ryoko replied, "I didn't know."

Tom: (Geraldo) Tonight on Geroldo, people who see different stuff but then it's
not true and they say they are groggy and they didn't know.
Iria: (Some Odd Person) A UFO landed in my backyard, then it was a Valu-Jet
Plane... I was groggy at the time.

>"Uhhh... Mihoshi,"The visitor said to Mihoshi already sitting at the table and
>eating, "weren't you going to introduce me to your friends?"

Crow: (Mihoshi) Actually, no...Remember I hired you to kill them!
Tom: You and Iria are especially Dark today.

>"What?  Oh... everyone this is Kale, my new partner," Mihoshi started as
>Kiyone stared with a gleam in her eyes, 

Tom: (Kiyone) Oww!!! Cut the sunlight out! It hurts!

>"Kale this my old partner Kiyone, my
>friends Ryoko, Aeyka and Sasami."

Iria: They didn't show anything that would show how Kiyone and Mihoshi got
seperated.
Mike: Just Smile and nod, Iria.


>"Forgetting someone," Kale said pointing at Tenchi, "Or is he some passer by?"

Tom: (Mihoshi) He's not improtant. He's only the main charecter of the series.

>"Oh yeah, that's Tenchi," Mihoshi said as she some what popped up with her
>hands clasped and her eyes shut for a second, "He's another good friend."

Crow: Does Mihoshi hate Tenchi or something?
Mike: I'll repeat it again... Just smile and nod.

>"Aeyka what time is it?" Tenchi asked, 

Crow: (Aeka) Time for some *Fun*!
Mike: Crow...

>"I said I would have a talk with Yousho
>today and I don't want to be late."

Crow: He has a special friend for me up there.
Mike: Now that was just plain sick.
Iria: Can I please blow his head off?
Mike: Wait until later.

>_________________________________________________________________________

Crow: He has been playing WAYYY to much Tetris...he already has 3 lines!

>Up at the Masaki shrine

Iria: Yosho was playing poker with Nobyuki and Gungho...
Crow: Why Gungho?
Iria: I don't no..
Mike: (Yosho) I'll take your two and raise it by 5
Crow: (Gungho) And I got a royal flush! HAha!
Iria: (Nobyuki) Well... I'll kick your ass with my Kick-yo-ass style karate!
That beats a Royal Flush!
Bots: (Make Toilet Flushing sounds)

>Yousho was sitting at a small table drinking tea when a shadow caught his eye.
>'It was nothing, it can't be' He looks around him.  "Tenchi is that you?" he
>says.

Tom: (Tenchi) Nah.... It's the easter Bunny!! WHO DO YOU THINK IT IS?

>"Sorry but Tenchi's not here at the moment but please a message for your next
>of kin so that they may her your last words old man!!" A voice like a vulture
>booms.

Crow: (Yosho) Yeah.... Tenchi, you are not getting any of my fortune and I'm
gonna make your life a living hell by giving it to the cat.

>Yousho looks around him for the origin of the voice.

Mike: But the voice was born in Alaska....
Tom: That doesn't make any sense..
Crow: Just smile and nod, like he always say.
Mike: Hey!

>"Nice one but I will kill him with extreme prejudice," a dragon like voice
>booms.

Iria: Boom...shakalaka?
Mike: Please.... This is a No Oscaring Room
Bots: Yeah...

>"Who are you, show yourselves!" Yousho cries.

Crow: (Starts to talk)
Iria: (Stares at him....with a shotgun)
Crow: Ok.... I won't say it...

>"Okay dokay, if you really want," a cackling voice cries, "Dark Knights reveal
>your true colors!!"

Iria: But it's black! We already are in our true colors!!

>Three armored figures move from the shadows into view.  One was dressed as a
>vulture but in ninja style. 

ALL: (Singing) Teenage Mutant Ninja Wierdos....

> The second was that of a porcupine with a foil in
>each hand.  The third as a dragon brandishing a long sword.   "What, not only
>do you hide behind shadows but as warriors of honor?" Yousho questions, "But
>I'm not afraid to fight honorable."

Crow: (Yosho) I'll show you how I fight honerable
Iria: THAT'S IT!! (Blows off Crow's heads with the shotgun)
Tom: WOAH!!!

>The Dragon steps forward. "Da names blaze, don't forget it for it is going to
>be the last name you hear old man!" 

Tom: (Yosho as Cartman) And I'm gonna kick you in da nutz!!

>The dragon says. He tosses Yousho out of
>the temple and to the foot of the stairs.  He signals to his partners, they in

Crow: (back with new head) Destroy the Shrine of Oscar!
Tom: Hey Crow...back already?

Iria: Killing Kenny in the process
Magic Voice: And also that South Park Holo Program.

>Tenchi and the rest look on in horror.  Tenchi looks at the rest of the house
>hold, "We must go up there, Yousho might be in trouble."

Tom: So... a church falls down and they think Yosho MIGHT be in trouble?
Mike: Could be.

>"Man I really want to ruff up the guys who did this." Ryoko said.
>"I don't want to lose Yousho again," Aeyka said.

Crow: (Aeka) He's my man..
Mike: Crow...I suggest you stop that before I hurt you.

>"What creeps," Sasami cried.

Tom: They dug right into my Bento Box full of snacks!
Others: (Start turning green)
Crow: I WOULDN'T EVEN TOUCH THAT!
Mike: I'll make you call Tsunmi if you do that again, Tom.
Tom: I'll be good.

>"What happened?" Mihoshi cried.
>"Desecrating a church, How vile!" Kale cried.

Iria: Looks like the author got a Thesaurus.

>The group speed toward the shrine to check the damages and see if Yousho was
>okay.  They made their way up the stairs to the foot of the shrine.  They
>gazed in shock.

Mike: It was the energizer bunny destroying the church...
Crow: We must pay respect to all those who lost to the Energizer Bunny.

>"Ah..More fuel for the fire," Blaze laughs, "My work will be slow and painful,
>for you that is!!! AH HAHAHAHAHA!!!"

Tom:(Blaze) It will cost $49.95 to do it though.

>"What did you do to Mister Masaki!!!" Kale said cutting everyone else off.

Crow: (Blaze) He owed me money! I sent him in the woodchipper!
Mike: (Blaze) I turned all of his questions into excalmatory senteces!!
Iria: (Blaze) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
Crow: I think Iria is getting the hang of this.

>"What does another weak old man mean to you.  He will be happy were he is,"
>Quills said with a cackle to his voice.

Tom: (Tenchi) Why...did he go to Happy World Land without me? (pretends to sob)

>Tenchi powers up the Tenchiken and with extreme hatred slashes at Blaze with
>tears forming in his eyes.  

Iria: (Tenchi) YOU KILLED HIM! YOU KILLED KENNY!!!!
Crow: Uhh... Did you watch South Park, Iria?
Iria: Yep...and Loved it!

>Blaze dodges every attack with great skill and
>dexterity, and thus comes back with a 

Tom: Hamster...
Mike: Doom CD
Iria: Cybernetic Fox?
Others: (Shudder)

Crow: (Drill Sargent) YOU WILL HATE THIS FIC! YOU WILL RUN LIKE A LITTLE GIRL AT

Others: YES, DRILL SARGENT!

>"Is that all you got boy?" Blaze laughs, "How's this for ya'.......... FLARE

Iria: What the?
Tom: So Kale is gonna kill Tenchi? Or is Kale gonna....
Crow: DUCK AND COVER!!
(Tom's head explodes)
Iria: Oh great....

>If your like me your wondering; 'Why hasn't Ryoko cleaned everyone's clock by

>CAN'T BEAT SOMEONE!!!! 
>WAIT!!!!! I HAVEN'T EXPLAINED WHY YET!!!!

Crow: (Author) You can't handle the truth!!

>Here is the missing scene from when Tenchi ran after Blaze:

Iria: Barney came and a whole load of kids ran over her.
Tom: (Coughing...also has new head)
Mike: Are you allright, Tom?
Tom: Yeah...

>"Yes, I did," The woman answers.

Mike: (Women) You are not needed her, Ryoko. Go and make dinner and poison the
enemies!
Crow: (Ryoko) But you said I wasn't needed here.
Mike: (Women) Never Mind that! Just make the Ramen Noodles!!
Tom: Geez... all 3 of them are dark today.

>"What good is a Galaxy Police Trainee?" Ryoko is now staring the woman

Iria: It's Rin Tin Tin!
Crow: Where did you get Rin Tin Tin outta this?
Iria: Well, isn't Kale a dog's name?
Tom: I don't think so...
Iria: Oh well.

>The mask figure wastes no time helping Tenchi up on his feet.
>"Who are....." Blaze stops his question and then shouts, "Kale of Corruption,
>PREPARE TO MEET THE FURY OF A DARK KNIGHT!!!!!"

Mike: I have great memories of this...

Crow:(Quills) I'm laughing at my own rediculous costume!!

Tom: Aeka's out of charecter, isn't she?
Crow: Thats Aeyka according to this fic.
Tom: I don't care.

>"Ryoko, you can attack now but don't stop me from massacring that little
>vulture Grayhawk,"  The young woman remarked.
>"Who?" Ryoko asks staring at the young woman.

Mike: (Women) The big ugly hawk ninja guy!

>"The ninja, just beat somebody okay!!!" The young woman snapped.
>"Okay," Ryoko said as she and the young woman launch at the three dark
>knights. 

Crow: But that failed quickly, as everyone died from GrayHawk's move. The End.
(Starts walking out)
Mike: Oh no you don't. You are going to suffer with us.

> Tenchi and Kale had by this time held back quills for Ryoko to zip
>in and punch him into a wall.

Crow: Shameless Plug #65: AAA Wrestling.

> Kale then turned his attention to Grayhawk that
>had turn into a winged ninja and was out maneuvering the young woman.

Tom: (Grayhawk) Lemme show you a few meneuvers....
Iria: Now that is just plain sick....


>  He came
>down with a quick slash and clipped the wing of the fling man.  The young
>woman then jumped on Grayhawk and was beating him into the ground. 

Mike:(Women) Never....steal...my..NABISCO....SNACKS!

> Everyone
>at that point looked for Yousho and Blaze.
>"Ma'Lady Kayura are you okay?" Kale asked the young woman.
>"Yes Kale.  I don't know what made me flip like that.  I haven't done that
>since the reign of the dynasty." Kayura replied.  Suddenly a roar came from
>farther up the hill.

Magic Voice: They Must have killed kenny...
Mike: You told us to stop Magic Voice....you must stop also.
Magic Voice: But I like that show!!
Tom: You can make some in part two.
Magic Voice: Allright...l

>"What was that?" 

Tom: That was just... (Singing) The Birds and The Bees and The Clouds and the
Trees...
Iria: Hey! Stop that wussie song!

>Tenchi shouted at the group. 

Mike: But Metallica stopped that from happening
Bots:(Singing) What I feel, What I've known. Turn the Pages, Turn to stone!

>They all looked up the mountain
>to see Yousho and Blaze in a duel, but blaze appeared as a dragon man in
>armor.

Tom: I thought he already was a dragon man in armor.
Crow: Just smile and nod.

>"Yousho..."They all screamed.

Iria: (Tenchi) You left the oven on!

>The battle ragged on for some time.

Crow: So Grayhawk and Tenchi had a spot of tea and exchanged tactics.

>  Neither side made any attempt to
>interfere. Blaze was skilled and was delivering blows with awesome skill and
>speed. Yousho was blocking and parrying to the best of his ability and was on
>the edge of defeat.  "I will destroy you old man.  With the blaze of the
>ages........FLARE OF DRAGONS!!!!!" 

Mike: And Yosho is turned into a baby!
Tom: Huh?
Mike: Never mind.

> Suddenly the land began to shake and the
>sky turned black.  From the end of Blazes' sword came a mighty flare that
>knocked Yousho off his feet. 

Crow: That would also be called a TRIP.

> Yousho now on the ground could do nothing, he
>was completely at the mercy of this merciless creature.  "Say good bye to your
>universe gramps," Blaze cackles as he points the sword down to thrust it into
>the man's chest.  Suddenly a flash of blue light cut down ward on Blaze and
>across his chest.

Tom: It's the amazing RANDO!!

>  Blaze stumbled and gazed at his attacker, it was Tenchi
>holding the Tenchiken with an angry look on his face. 
> "This can't be,  

Mike:(Blaze) I had a free ticket to the water park and it expired!!

>DARK
>RAVEN I HAVE FAILED YOU MY LORD!!!"

Iria: (Blaze) I got a 'F' in math, science, and industrial tech!

> Blaze screamed at the top of his lungs,
>"Dark Knights, Retreat.  This not the last you will see of me Emperor Tenchi,
>your army will not defeat Dark Raven." And with that the  three dark knights
>dis appeared into thin air. 

Tom: But they accedently vanished into a area someone was in and was
Telefragged...


> The team survaded the damage and looked at each
>other.

Mike: (Butthead) You know what, Beavis?
Crow: (Beavis) What? hehehe.
Mike: (Butthead) This sucks
Iria: I would agree with Beavis and Butthead more than ever one that.

>"What now the temple is destroyed, the rubble is every where, what can we do?"
>Kale said naively.

Tom: MAYBE CLEAN IT UP!!
Crow: Tom...calm down.

>"I could rebuild it for you in, ohh...  an hour or so," Washuu had just come
>up the stairs she had been monitoring the fight from her lab, "Miss Kayura,
>long time no see.  I remember your father, he helped me with Talpa five
>thousand years ago."

(All 4 blink at the screen)
Iria: Do you have any idea what that just said.
Others: NO.

>"Yes I'll fill you in on the details later but can you repair the shrine
>Goddess Washuu," Kayura asks.
>"Yes and it's not Goddess Washuu it's Washuu Chan..," Washuu Corrects.

Iria: (Kayura) Allright Goddess Washu
Tom: Thats Washuu according to the fic
Iria: Whatever.

>_________________________________________________________________________

Crow: It's not possible to have a 5 lines in a row in Tetris, you know..
Mike: Would you knock it off with the Tetris jokes
Tom: (Hums the Tetris Theme A...the addicting one)
Mike: (Groans)

>Ten thousand years ago in the system of the gray star

Tom: Nothing happened! Good Night
Crow: Oh really? (Starts to leave)
Mike: Don't think so! (restrains Crow)

>A shogun magi known only as Dark Raven emerged
>His only thought was to destroy the Universe
>Only to create his own and be hailed as a god

Iria: But that drastically failed and he set up a successful international
company!
Crow: If he set up a sucess Company..
Tom: Known world wide...
Bots: AHHH!! MICROSOFT!! HE DID SUCEED IN HIS WISH!!

>His selfish wish would go on unfulfilled
>The magi was soon chased by three goddess
>In an attempt to save the universe

Mike: but it failed, and the Goddess made Macintosh!
Bots: NOOO!!


>No one could figure out how he would do it
>But they knew it required three planets

Tom: Pluto, Mercury, and Uranus
Crow: Can you just imangine the god Uranus in roman times saying that?
Mike:(Uranus) I am the god Uranus and you will do as I command
Iria: (Snickers)

>Juria; Earth; And the Planet of the gray star
>In his haste the magi was corner on earth

Iria: And given a time out.

>He was then sealed by the three goddesses
>To spend eternity on this primitive planet

Mike: Tom... explain this for us.
Tom: Well, I'll be glad to. You see, everyone thinks that we are primitive
because there are more superior beings out there that are more advanced. Earth
would be seen as a primitive planet and therefore be enslaved.
Other: (Claps)

>But it was this that sparked mans rise in power
>This divine intervention started the rise of a race that
>Would ultimately destroy this prison some time in the future
>As to stop this the goddesses spoke that
>If the prison is to break five groups of heros

Mike: Bones.
Crow: Heart.
Tom: Spirit.
Iria: You know what... thats a grammer error
Bots: Crap.

>Would come together to stop Dark Raven 
>And end the Armageddon Prophecy
>Forever

Tom: Thus the name.

>_________________________________________________________________________

Crow: (Hums Tetris Theme B)

>"Akane wake up, 

Tom: I...
Iria and Mike: NO!
Tom: Ok...

>it's such a beautiful day outside and you shouldn't spend it
>sleeping," Kasumi yells up the stairs.
>"Do I have to, can't I enjoy the day better if I'm comfortable?" Akane yells

Crow: This is just full of very very bad riffs!
Iria: So don't say anything and you will be fine.

>back from her bed.
>"Yes that is kind of true, but you have school pictures today," Kasumi yells
>back.
>"What!" Akane yelled.

ALL: SHE SAID YOU HAVE SCHOOL PICTURES TODAY!

>"Ya, Akane and if we don't get there fast we'll be at the end of the line with
>the all the greasy losers, wait that's right where you belong," Ranma shouts
>up the stairs.  Suddenly a large chair comes fling down from the top of the
>stairs and just misses Ranma.

Mike: Welcome to the ROYAL RUMBLE of Ranma 1/2 charecters
Tom: In this corner, we have Ranma and Genma, and in this Akane and her FOOD!
Iria: Don't EVER say that to Akane....trust me on that.

>"Don't they get along great they make a perfect couple," Kasumi remarks
>without a hint of sarcasm.

Crow: Who is she talking to?

>_________________________________________________________________________


>"JAWS YOU DRUNK'IN SLOB GET UP!!!" a voice booms from a small room.  A man
>dressed like an Amazon fur trapper gets up and whips himself off.
>"What is it, did Blaze fail again?" The man answered.

Mike:(Voice) Yeah, I demoted him to C-ko food tester.
Magic Voice: Don't get him mixed up with me.

>"Yes, but I have a different job for you," I shadowy figure says, "Ever hear
>of Ranma Saotome."
>"Student of the Saotome school of Anything goes Karate, world class champion
>so," The man answers.

Iria: (Voice) Get me his autograph.

>"Find him and kill him.  I will fill you in on the details later.  Now, GO!!!"
>The Voice Booms.

Crow: Time to use the bathroom for Jaws
Iria: Now THAT is sick...

>_________________________________________________________________________

>Good Bye and Thank you for reading, please watch for the next chapter of
>Battlestar.... I mean ARMAGGEDON PROPHOECY. GOOD NIGHT!

Iria: And good night to you too!
Mike: Let's get out of here

(Everyone exits)

[Door 1: You exit the theater and the door swirves to the right.]
[Door 2: It's a a small paper opening.]
[Door 3: It's a stack of Metallica CD's. You put the one you got earlier back]
[Door 4: It's a portal. You Enter it to continue.]
[Door 5: You walk past a broken TV.]
[Door 6: It's the game of Tetris. You play it some more and continue on.]

§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
	"Well, you know.... it could've been worse" said Iria. The 4 exited the
theater and was greeted by gypsy and a small device similar to the Ultima Weapon
shown earlier.
	"Hey Guys" started Gypsy. "TV Frank gave us this"
	"Hey! He's dumb enough to send us Dr.F's Ultima Weapon!" shouted Mike.
	"Gypsy, fire away at Deep 13, hehehe" said Crow. Gypsy slinked along to the
weapons chamber, which was bare for the longest time, and armed the Ultima
Weapon. On the HectoScreen, around that time, Dr. Clayton Forrester came on.
	"Greetings, did you recieve that old invention of mine" said Dr.F nicely.
"I told Frank I didn't have a use for it."	
	"The Ultima Weapon?" asked Iria. "You had no use for it?"
	"Frank sent.....you....the Ultima WEAPON!???" shouted Dr. Forrester. "Oh
Shi*! Send it back!"
	"Too late.... This is what you deserve for sending us bad fanfics all this
time!!!" yelled Servo. "FIRE"
	Gypsy loaded the gun and activated it. It did nothing for 5 seconds then
suddenly blasted it's target....
	"Uhh.... did we set a target, guys?" asked Crow.
	"Uh oh..." said Servo.
	The laser landed 15 miles from Gizmonic Institute, making a small crater.
This caused traffic on interstate 40 to be held up for 50 minutes
	"You missed, Gypsy" said Servo.
	"Well, you didn't tell her a target" said Gypsy.
	"MWHAHAH!! !YOU MISSED" shouted the Doc. "Activate Program XZG-10XA: Deep
13." The gun magically disapeered and was back in the hands of Dr.F. "Phew! That
was close. Now I gotta go blast Frank with this on Stun. Enjoy part 2 of the
Armageddon Prophecy. 
	"Oh, nice going Tom" said Crow. "You really did it."
	"Bite me, Crow!!" shouted Servo. "Bite me"
 	The yellow light flashed off
	"Uhh.... We'll be right back" said Mike, hitting the yellow button.
	"BITE ME Times 2, Servo" yelled Crow.
	"Bite Me times a Visa Gold with 0.9 APR!!"
	"Bite Me" yelled Iria, pointing a shotgun at both of them.
	"Uhh.. I'd rather not" said Crow.
	"Yeah... me too" said Servo.
