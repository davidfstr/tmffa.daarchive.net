I can see you
When I close my eyes.
You're every thing to me, 
And yet you don't realize

How much I try to hide behind
This royal costume and mask.
I just can't seem to tell you
I just can't seem to ask...

I know she sets your heart afire,
I know you want her so,
I know that you see me as a friend,
And it makes my heart ache so...

I've tried to tell you so many times
I've tried to make you see
That beneath all the royal airs,
There's a tiny little me.

I've never felt this way before,
I've never let my heart decide,
Only I wish I had spoken up
Before that demon caught your eye.

I know I'm not as pretty,
(About that I'll flatly deny!)
And I try to act as dignified
As a princess of Jurai.

Why can't see the real me
Why can't you see my guise
I need you to comphort me
You've opened up my eyes...

I know you do not know me,
I know that it's too late.
She's already stolen your heart from me,
And that I must accept my fate.
