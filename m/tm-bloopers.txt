Tenchi Muyo! Bloopers


Disclaimer: Now, before we start, I want you peoples to know that I do not
own any of these characters, Pioneer and AIC? does.  So, don't sue me.  You
wouldn't sue a girl with braces now, would you?

Also, I would like to tell you sensitive people out there that if I offend
you in anyway, please accept my apologies and do not flame me.  If you
choose to flame me, I will simply ignore it, or E-mail you back stating the
fact that I did apologize ON THE FANFIC!  Thank you.

Another message and I promise I'll get to the fanfic.  This fanfic is about
if the Tenchi cast really existed and if they had to really act the show.
So, naturally, there would be bloopers.  This fanfic is based heavily
on OVA 6.  That is "We Need Tenchi."  Ok?  All right, let's get this
rolling...

Director:  Ryoko, look fierce, remember that you hate Kagato, and Kagato,
you look like you just don't give a screw and pretend to turn Ryoko into
stone.
Kagato:  But I can't turn her into stone.
Ryoko:  No duh, you idiot!  The special effects will take care of that!
Kagato: Oh.
Washu:  Somebody's been drinking too much sake!
Director:  Washu, you hide behind the curtain.
Washu: I didn't create the cameras so some baka like you can go off on a
power trip, ya know!
Assistant Director: Just get behind the curtain!
*Washu storms off, destroying the curtain before she goes.*
Director:  I hate this job.
Assistant Director: All right guys--
Ryoko: And girls.
Assistant Director: (sighs) And girls, we're at the part after you destroy
his shadow, and right before he grabs your neck.
Kagato: But my shadow's right here.
Ryoko: (growling) No duh, you baka!
Assistant Director: (sweatdrop) Let's just get on with the show, shall we?
And... TAKE ONE!
Ryoko: Shadow...
Kagato: (grabs Ryoko's neck)  Ryoko, I am your father!
Director: CUT!  What the heck was that?
Kagato:  I'm sorry, I couldn't resist, honestly...
Director:  You go back to your trailer.  Get Mihoshi out here.
Kagato: Uh huh...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Director: OK Mihoshi, we're at the part when you bump your cube and you get
sent to the next dimension.
Mihoshi: (lip trembling) I'm going to hell?
Director: NO!  Reversed World, you idiot!
Mihoshi:  Oh.  Now, what am I supposed to do again?
Director: (face faults) Bump your cube...
Mihoshi: Oh!
Director: (sarcastically) Yes, that's a good girl.  And... TAKE TWO!
Mihoshi: Oh, where did they go?
*Mihoshi bumps her cube against the wall, but nothing happens.  Suddenly, a
muffled scream is heard outside.*
Mihoshi: Hmmm, I guess my cube did something different this time.
Director: What the heck happened?
Assistant Director: It seems that Kagato's trailer flipped over.
Director:  Oh no... Well, get Kagato out here, see if he's all right.  Get
Washu out here too.  As for you Mihoshi, you stay here.
Mihoshi:  Hmmm...
Director:  Mihoshi, stop playing with your cube!
*Suddenly, a huge heap of dirty laundry falls on top of the Director.*
Director:  I REALLY hate this job.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Director: Washu, this is the part where you make that big screen of the
battle appear.  OK?
Washu: Yeah!
Director:  Mihoshi, you just stand there, OK?
Mihoshi: Can do!
Director: Great!  And...TAKE THREE!
Washu:  Well, there is one thing we can do...
*Washu waves her hand, but instead of a big screen of the battle, a big
screen showing the Pokemon movie comes up*
Washu: Yeah!  Get them, Lugia!
Director: What?  Put that back!
Washu:  But it's just getting to the good part!
Director:  I DON"T CARE!
Washu: (frowning)  You're no fun...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assistant Director: OK, we finally got the right screen on.  Let's see...oh
yeah!  It's the part where you hand Mihoshi the fans, OK?  That should be
easy for you!
Washu: Of course!  Nothing's impossible for Little Washu!
Assistant Director: (sweatdrop) OK... And, TAKE FOUR!
Washu: Here, take this!
*Washu reaches into her uniform and pulls out a pair of boxers*
Washu: Ooops...
Assistant Director:  Where did that come from?
Washu: Hehe...I think it was from my last experiment, or something like
that.  Ya know, this and that...
Mihoshi:  Oh, I know!  Those boxers belonged to Te--
Washu: (slaps Mihoshi) I said something like that!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Director:  It seems that Kagato is fine, but Tenchi's complaining about
missing boxers.
Assistant Director: (sweatdrops) Uh, I don't know anything about missing
undies...
Director:  Whatever.  Now, Tenchi, this is where you try to save Ryoko, but
your leg gets stuck in your pants opening, OK?
Tenchi:  Yup!
Ryoko:  I'm ready!
Kagato: (limps in) Yeah right.
*All of them gives him the eye of death*
Kagato: (Jolly Green Giant sweatdrop) I mean, yeah, me too!
Director: And...TAKE FIVE!
Ryoko: Tenchi!
Tenchi: (glaring at Kagato, then suddenly grabs his bottom) Jeez, I can't
get it out!
Director: CUT!  Tenchi, why are you grabbing your rear end?
Kagato: (clears throat) I think Tenchi is having a major wedgie attack.
*At this, Ryoko falls down laughing.  Tenchi is still hopping around,
clamping his bottom.*
Director:  I should have been a talk show host.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Director:  OK, this is when Ayeka escapes Kagato's mind puzzle.  Ryoko, you
throw the saber sword at his arm later.  Don't worry Kagato, your arm is
pulled back in your sleeve so it won't really hit it. Clear? (Without
waiting for a response) OK!  And... TAKE SIX!
Ayeka: Oh no, you are not Yosho!
Kagato: (backs away from  a huge amount of light) Well, I see Tsunami must
be protecting those of royal blood.  In that case...
*The director signals to Ryoko to throw the sword.  She does.*
Director: Ryoko, where exactly did you aim?
Assistant Director:  Man, we are going to need a lawyer for this.
Kagato: I CAN'T FEEL MY @$$!
Ayeka: I think Ryoko had a bit too much sake before the take.
