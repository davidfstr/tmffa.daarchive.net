[Group assembly in progress...]

Ryoko phased in to the dark hallway, and looked around in surprise.  "Hey -
what's this place?  I was trying to find Sasami, but I guess phased to the 
wrong part of Washu's lab.  Hmm, this doesn't seem like Was-" Ryoko was cut
off as the lights began to click on, winking on down a seemingly endless hall.
She took two steps down the hall, but turned quickly when she heard a thump
behind her...

[working]

Tenchi dropped the basket of carrots as his peaceful walk back to the shed 
and his vision of the beautiful summer afternoon was replaced with the cold
conditioned air of the hallway.  Ryoko was about to glomp him, when...

[working]

Kagato's ashes swirled up out of nowhere, reforming the villainous (yet 
fashionably-dressed) dead scientist directly between Ryoko and Tenchi.  For
some unexplained reason, they did not immediately attack each other.  This
was fortuitous, because at that moment...

[working]

Zetsura stumbled out of the shower wearing a very oversized robe.  Except he
wasn't standing in his bathroom anymore.  Ryoko, Kagato, and Tenchi were
puzzling over their respective appearances in the mysterious hallway.

[assembly completed.  Theater construction diagram loaded...theater ready.]

"Please proceed to theater entry and take a seat.  Fic begins in 5 minutes."
rang the voice of the computerized MST theater.  Zetsura groaned.  "Not now!
Damn computer's found another one of these multiverse-defiling creations of
the scum of the Earth!  We have to stop it!"

Kagato focused his penetrating eyes on Zetsura.  "What's the meaning of this?"
he demanded.

Zetsura rushed down the hall.  "No time!  Follow me if you want to live!"
After running (or flying, in Ryoko's case) for several minutes, they found
that the corridor ended at a set of double doors marked with engraved silver
letters "TNF Fanfic Screening Room 3000".  Zetsura held one door open and
motioned for the others to find an open seat.  There were only four chairs.

"You know the drill.  This heap of trash was rated-" Zetsura pulled up a
small screen on the arm of his chair, then paled.  "unrated.  The ratings
system crashed while previewing the fic on, uh, line eleven."

"What?!?" screamed Tenchi.  "I've been dragged into some really bad lemons
before, but I specifically told AIC and Pioneer to get their lawyers on the
job or else the OAV3 deal was off!"

Zetsura sighed.  "I'm sorry, but the sanity and even the existence of your
universe is at stake here.  Even the lawyers have failed to stop this menace.
You wouldn't give up so easily, would you?"

"You're...serious?  Well...nothing to do but save the world, like usual," 
sighed Tenchi.  "I'm with Tenchi, no matter what." said Ryoko with a hard
look in her eyes.  Kagato sneered, but shrugged in his typical evil-careless
way as he said "This can't be worse than being dead, anyway."

"Don't be so sure of th-" Zetsura's warning was drowned out by the sound
system of the theater rumbling through an audio test.

[Fanfic display activated.  Viewer actions recorded and noted by ">".]

I DO NOT own Tenchi Muyo or anything else, they belong to AIC and Pioneer.
None of the characters, even the SI's are mine. But who cares. MWAHHAA!!

Kagato's Little Secret

>Ryoko (glances sideways at Kagato): "Something you're not telling us?"
>Kagato (glaring): "Zip it, you.  I refuse to be associated with this in
any way!"

by Kagato's testacle

>Ryoko (choking with laughter): "Written by Kagato's te.test..ahahAHAHAHA!!!!"
>Kagato (grinding teeth):  "ARRGH!"
>Zetsura (quietly, to Tenchi): "That's some talent."

Imagine the worst stories you've ever read. Imagine the worst authors you've
ever heard of in your life. Imagine what would happen if they banded
together. You will find out here the worst that could possibly happen. And
one other thing.....SAKUYA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
MWAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHhAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>Tenchi:  "Really, that's not very fair - I mean, Yugi was just misguided,
and poor Sakuya was trying to-"
>Ryoko: "Give it up, the author's-" (cringing) "right, for once."

In a small room, around a large red table, sat the most famous authors of
Tenchi Fics. The first one was the ever pious AAA-Phucknut, who was at the
moment jacking off to the latest edition of Tenchi in Tokyo, where Tenchi
has a graphic sex scene with Amagaski. To his left was a small redhaired
lady, she appeared to be an almost identical copy of Washu, that was except
for the mucus dripping tentacles in her hair. Next we had a normal looking
boy, his eyes appeared to be vacant and his stare was insidious. On his
shirt was the picture of a policeman inside a tank, below the picture were
the words, Tankcop. After him was a freaky young man who appeared to be an
alien, on his shirt was the number Fifty two. There were many others after
that but those were the ones that were currently talking at the moment.

>Kagato: "Besides the permanent mental scarring associated with hearing 
the words 'sex' and 'Amagasaki' in the same sentence, this is merely 
boring.  I don't see the danger here."
>Tenchi (nearly comatose): "You mean you don't know Tankcop?  Plate of 
Sashimi? Alienboy52? Washutentacles?  The most disgustingly graphic
writers in all of fanficdom?"
>Kagato: "I've been dead, you fool!  The dead don't read!"
>Ryoko (quietly, to Zetsura): "Lucky bastard."

"It's pure genius!" Phucknut yelled out as he stroked his pale green salami.

>All: "ewww..."
>Ryoko (radio announcer): "Ah yes.  Waxing the walrus, as it were.  Spanking
the monkey, playing with the platypus, choking the chicken.  Also known as
grabbing the giraffe, masturbating, jerking off, polishing the peacock, and
massaging the moose.  One might even say that he was getting his goat.  Other
alternatives include prodding the pony, fingering the frog, and poking the 
pig.  This message brought to you by pork - the other white meat."

"MGPNobuyuki hasn't had a real gig since that part where he killed himself
after ripping off his dick!"

>Zetsura: "That would be because he was DEAD!"
>Kagato (frowning): "Didn't stop you from bringing me back."
>Zetsura: "Oh.  Right."

"But" Washutentacles slithered out a she observed the authors. "I haven't
finished my story, Kagato Revenge must be finished. I have something even
worse in store for Sasami! HAHAHAHAAH!!!" She cackled madly and two
tentacles slithered onto her shoulders and wiggled around.

"Tankcop, what about you?" Alienboy52 asked as he turned towards the
deranged youth. "You've been silent since this meeting started." Tankcop
turned towards him and grinned maniacly.

>Tenchi (hiding behind his chair): "Tell me when it's over!  I'm just a 
simple farm boy!  I don't wanna save the world!"

"I believe I have the answer." All of the other members leaned towards him.
"I was thinking about this while my fics were being mst'ed by Ksawarrior and
his loser crew..except for Rei of course. Our fics are deadly but they
aren't nearly strong enough, what we need to do is join forces. We take all
of our ideas and create the most horrid event ever, the most disgusting fic
by far." A grunt is heard from Phucknut. "Yes?" He asks as he turns towards
him, just in time to take a full on load of jizz onto his face. The white
milky liquid lingured on his face and his began licking at it, savoring the
wonderful taste and incredible aroma. "Mmmm, what did you have..cantalope?"
Phucknut just smiles.

>Kagato (eyes flashing): "You dare to form a group more evil than me?" 
<involuntarily forms green energy sword, which nearly lops off Zetsura's 
head> "FACE MY WRATH!!!!!"  <charges toward the screen, until his foot is 
caught by Zetsura>
>Zetsura (indignant): "HEY!  Watch where you swing that thing! I-" <sinks 
back into chair, horrified> (quietly) "stop helping the fic, stop helping 
the fic, stop helping the fic..." <takes a deep breath>

"Alright then..it's agreed." Alienboy52 spoke as he began to lick Tankcop's
face. Everyone began to move in on Phucknut and began to lick his face
profusely.

>Ryoko (peeking through her fingers): "Not to sound picky like a certain
princess *cough*Ayeka*cough*, but are they licking Phucknut or Tankcop?  
I'd rather not know, but somebody has to point out the continuity holes,
right?"
>Tenchi (fingers in ears, eyes shut): <stays silent> 
>Kagato: <turns green>
>Zetsura: *HUUUGHH!!!!*  <violently spews his last meal onto the floor>
>Kagato: *BLEAUUGH!!!!!* <adds his lunch to Zetsura's>

--------------------D   *splurt*

>Ryoko: "No, it was more like 'HUUUGHH' and 'BLEAUUGH'.  And Kagato, where
did you get all that corn?"
>Zetsura (eyes watering): <tries to laugh, but burps up more chunks instead>

Sammy walked down the stairs to her school in a hurry, she needed to be home
or her mom would be mad and beat her.
As she walked she noticed that her friend misao was crying softly, her cute
unformed breasts her poking out of her shirt in an inviting fashion. Sammy
felt her virgin pussy tighin and contract, this was getting her very hot.

>Ryoko (eyes glow red): "Sasami's way out of bounds!  I can't allow this-"
<motes of power coalesce in her hands, moments before she releases a blast
of plasma directly at the theater screen> "DIE, YOU *&*$$%^ (@(*&$^@#!!!!"
>Zetsura (recovering a bit): <jumps behind the row of chairs, dragging
Kagato to the ground>
>***BOOOOMMM!!!!!***  The tremendous explosion fills the room, blowing
Tenchi, Zetsura, and Kagato clear to the back of the theater.

She skipped over to the crying girl and put her arms around her. Misao
looked up with tearful eyes and began to mumble.

"I tried to be good.." Misao cried out in saddness. "He said that I was
great last time, but I wasn't good this time."

"Who?" Sammy asked with great concern in her eyes.

>Ryoko (coughing, from somewhere near the seats): "DAMMIT! What's that
screen made of, anyway?!"
>The dust settles, revealing that the screen is slighty cracked.
>Tenchi (eyes as wide as dinner plates): "Wow, Ryoko - you did that with
just one gem?"
>Ryoko (astonished): <looks at right wrist, realizing that she forgot to
use her spare gem, then grins evilly toward Tenchi> "Now that you mention
it, why not return the other two gems." <gives Tenchi the cutest possible 
smile>
>Tenchi (flustered): "Uh, sorry, but Ryoko - I didn't bring the sword with
me."
>Ryoko: <sweatdrops>

"Extreme, he says that I wasn't as good this time." She shook her head and
looked towards the floor. She then thought of something and grinned at her
friend. "I know, how about you come with me and help me out!"

>Kagato (sarcastically): "Oh, sure.  Right after I take this candy from a
stranger, put my hand on a hot stove, fall down a well, and- oh wait.  My
calendar doesn't look very open today.  How about tomorrow?"

"I don't know, I mean I don't want to cheat on Cycracks..but oh well, He
hasn't been satisfying my underaged pussy lately anyway, I've had to resort
to Tsunami for the last few days. And she can sure be a bitch sometimes.

>All: O_O;

Sammy lick my cunt, sammy use your whips, Sammy ram it up my ass!" She
raised her hands up in indignation. 

>All: "TSUNAMI?!?!?!"
>Tsunami (appearing behind them): "Yes?"
>All: <point to the still-visible subtitles>
>Tsunami: "ACK!" <falls to the floor, apparently having a seizure>

"Hell she even brought out one of her
branches and told me to suck it! Disgusting!" Sammy thought about this
situation and continued. "But if he says "Extreme transformation" or
anything like that. I'm kicking his ass."

>Kagato: "THAT sounds like an excellent idea, regardless of whether or
not he says 'Extreme transformation'."
>Tsunami (recovering): "This 'Extreme' person seems to be begging for an
encounter with my spaceship form." <fades out>

--------------------D *splat splat*

Sammy and Misao reached her home shortly afterwards, the open beer cans and
used condom trails could lead them hear anyday. They walked up to the door
and began to open it when they heard some moans from the inside. They opened
the door silently and peaked inside. What they saw was disturbing.

"Oh Extreme your so great!" A man with sunglasses yelled out as he gripped
his throbbing tool 

>Ryoko: "Backed by the Sears lifetime warranty."

"Your ass is just so tasty and EXTREME!" The man being
pounded looked up towards him and winked.

>Zetsura: "Not to be confused with an 'EXTREME' ass such as the author, or
this tasteless waste of ten kilobytes of webserver disk space."

"Your not so bad yourself ZeroCool." He twised over and frenched the man
deeply. " Pound me with that big fat tool of yours. And after that shove
that lifesaver up my anus too!" The two girls visibly blanched and shut the
door quietly.

>Tenchi (Crocodile Hunter): "We have just witnessed the mating rituals of the
pervertia idiotus.  Never in my life have I been so close to death; the 
unspeakable horror freezes my blood.  It is best to leave them alone,
and give all such creatures a wide berth.  Or a hand grenade, minus the pin."

"That was disturbing." Sammy spoke as Misao shook her head in agreement. As
they left they could have sworn they heard somebody yell out "Extream
Transformation!"

------------------------D *squuuuirrrrrrrt*

>Kagato: "Just what I like to hear!  The sound of the author's blood spraying
from his neck as my sword separates the head from the body.  Perhaps these
sound effects do have a point to them after all..."

Sammy and Misao shook their heads as they headed up to the large and
mysterious mansion. 

>Zetsura:  "Riiiiiggght.  The mysterious mansion.  Just next door." 

They wondered outloud why they would go to such a wierd
place but they just shrugged it off. They opened the door to the mansion and
walked inside, closing the door silently and tiptoeing inside. Just as they
were about to reach the kitchen a bizarre site befell them. A strangely
dressed man came running out of the kitchen and was tackled by a crazy guy
in a tutu.

>Kagato: "Just a guess, but is the tutu wearer 'Magical Girl Pretty Noboyuki'?"
>Tenchi and Ryoko: <nod>
>Zetsura: "Who's the other man?"
>Tenchi: <shrugs>
>Zetsura: "Maybe the context of the next few lines will clear things up."

"You will be the one to carry my unborn child!" The man yelled out maniacly
as he ripped off the old guys pants. 

>Zetsura: "This really isn't helping.  Is the 'strangely dressed man' yelling
and ripping off his 'old guys' pants?  Or is the 'strangely dressed man'
actually the 'old guy' who is getting his pants ripped off by MGPNoboyuki?" 
>Kagato (whispering to Zetsura): "But the real question is, where did he get
the unborn child?"
>Zetsura: "Urp-uurRP!!" <breakfast joins the lunch puddle on the floor>

He then twisted the guy over and shoved
his shriveld old cock right inside his butt, cutting it up and making blood
splurt everywhere, including onto the two little girls. 

>Zetsura (ill, but trying to make a point): "See what I mean?  Who's shoving
who's what into whom, and what is getting cut up, exactly?"
>Tenchi and Kagato: **HUUUUUUUUUURL!** <projectile vomit now hides all traces
of the plush carpeting from the seating area to the screen in front>
>Ryoko (straining to keep what little she ate for dinner last night): "Zetsura!
SHUT THE HELL UP!"
>Zetsura (looking very ill, and apologetic): "Sorry!  I can't seem to control
myself any more!  The fic is twisting us too.  We've got to DO something!"

A bizare Idea
overcame the girls, one which they couldn't will against. 

>All:  "Yes, they could.  Really.  We're positive that this bizarre 'Idea' 
can be resisted.  Think happy thoughts."
>Ryoko: <chanting, eyes closed, tapping her heels together> "There's no place
like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home..."

Sudddenly they
latched onto each other and began licking the blood from their respective
bodies. After they were done, their minds returned to normal and they ran
towards the bathroom passing by a strange room with a couple of weird
people.

"Please, Tenchi help!" Sakuya yelled out as a demonic beast began ripping
off her titties. 

>Tenchi: "Why should I help the demonic beast?  He seems to be doing just fine
on his own."
>Others: <stare open-mouthed at Tenchi>
>Tenchi (meekly): "Ss..sorry." <slouches as deep in his chair as possible>

Blood splurted from her mouth and she ejactulated right
there. The monster ripped off one of her legs and began to knaw on it like a
piece of chicken. As the unfortunate lady began hyperventalating and cried
until she loss the ability to cry anymore. The monster licked the bone clean
and tossed it aside. And then opened it's eyes and shoved a large metal
knife up her pussy, making jut all the way up to her mouth. Sakuya wiggled
and flapped her arms for a moment and then blood exploded from her and
splashed all on the ground and onto the monster, with a grin it licked it's
teeth and continued eating the girl from inside and out.

>Kagato: "That's just disgusting.  I'm sadistic and all that, but what's with
the gory mess-" <recognition sets in> "Oh, I get it.  The fic has simply
merged with that first-person shooter 'Quake' that I created.  It all makes
perfect sense now."
>Kagato's head begins to spin around and around, then it explodes with 
roughly the same amount of gore you might expect if an elephant was hit by
a freight train. 

Misao and Sammy reached the bathroom in a hurry, they closed the door and
took off their clothes. As Sammy gazed upon Misao's majestic body, her ass
made a rumble and she clutched it insanely. Misao looked up with concern and
raise an eyebrow.

Ryoko (wiping bits of Kagato from her dress): "This can't be good."
Zetsura (ditto): "Tenchi, we need the Wings."
Tenchi (ditto): "Right." 

"I have to take a dump." Sammy said as she clutched the toiletseat. Misao
grabbed her and shook her head, Misao then sat down on the ground and becond
for the blue haired girl to follow. As Sammy passed over Misao, her ass
exploded and shit came splashing down, splashing all over Misao. Misao
opened her shit overed eyes and looked towards Sammy, she then grinned and
licked her fingers. Sammy smiled gratefully and then put her clothes on, she
passed over misao and frenched her gratefully.

>Zetsura presses his palms together, and the Virtual Mode shuts off its matter/
antimatter containment fields.  Approximately fifty quadrillion metric tons of
matter is converted to energy and funneled between graviton shaping rings.
>Tenchi summons his power, bringing the three Light Hawk Wings forward into a
spear of brilliance.
>Zetsura opens the space between his hands, and the unbounded VM Blade releases
the immense energy surge as Tenchi casts the Light Hawk Spear at the center 
of the imaging screen.
>The screen is sliced in half, and the wall behind it disappears before the
theater fills with roiling clouds of dust and smoke.
>Vision is impossible, between the blinding light and obscuring smoke.
>*
>*
>*
>The afterglow fades from their retinas, and they all squint hard enough to 
see Kagato sit up, regenerated.
>The smoke begins to clear...

As they passed by they again passed by the same room only there was a
different person in it this time.

>The audio continues to play, but the screen has fallen into a ruined mess at
the front of the theater.  There is a huge hole in the wall, and the pool of
vomit is gone from the scorced tatters of carpeting.

"I declare! Lord Tenchi..Help me!!" A purple haired girl asked as the demon
walked up to the woman and reached out, pulling out her eyeballs and eating
them, savoring the warm squishiness of the balls. The woman screamed out to
the world and lurched back. The monster licked his fingers and walked up the
woman, with a thrust he reached into her gut and ripped out her intestines,
he then set them on a platter and began to suck them like spagetti noodles.
Ayeka smashed against the floor and died painfully, having been brutally
violated by a big ugly monster.

>Zetsura (violently): <punts one chair through the hole in the wall>
"ENOUGH!  DOMAIN CONTROL OVERRIDE!"

The two girls walked up a staircase that had conviently appeared. They
rushed towards another room and opened it up.

>A column of jet-black glass rises and morphs from the floor.  Its surface
is like the edge of reality and space and time - drawing the eyes deeper
into its inky endlessness.
>Zetsura (shouting even louder): "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!"

(This scene is specifically for you Shorin)

"Oh! Ryo-Ohki, your so spectacular!" Tenchi yelled out as he clutched the
small furball and rammed his penis inside her, illiciting a pained myia and
a crumpled moan. "Yes, So soft and warm!" He held her up and began using her
to jack himself off." The two girls quickly shut the door just before they
heard a horrible tearing sound. "Oh well, I'll just use your eye socket
now!" Her yelled out as a nasty squishing sound was heard.

>Tenchi and Ryoko: <cling to each other in fear, then faint>
>Kagato and Zetsura: "MOMMY!" <clamp hands over ears in a vain attempt to 
shut out the sound>

"Let's get out of here!" Sammy screamed out in terror as she turned around
towards Misao, only there was someone else there instead.

>Domain Control Column (flashing): "ENFORCING THE PRIMARY LOGIC ROUTING 
DIAGRAM - NOW."
>The remains of the display and theater wavered and dissolved into bits and 
particles that shrank into the distance, leaving the viewers in a sea of
merciful blackness.

Zetsura woke up on the cold floor on his bathroom, with a painful knot on
the back of his skull.  "Maybe - it was - just a dream.  Yeah, a bad dream."

"Wait a minute, my dreams are not THAT sick.  What really hap-" Zetsura
noticed that he was not alone.  In fact, the unconscious bodies nearby proved,
on closer inspection, to be Tenchi, Ryoko, and Kagato.  Kagato was floating
face-up in the whirlpool tub, while Tenchi slouched in a corner by the door.
Ryoko was curled up on the floor next to Tenchi.

"Oh dear."  Zetsura passed out again.
