This is my first Tenchi fanfic. It is based off of the song by Dr.Dre, 
"The Message". This takes place in Nobyuki's perspective about Achika's 
death.

don't own Tenchi Muyo! or anything else.Don't sue me.

The Message by SSJ_Bardock


[Nobyuki]
Since you finishin her early, what posessed you to start her?
We made a vow - til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
you coulda forgave her, you didn't have to take her
She can take the love with her, cause she defines the word
The one who puts the L in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out saki behind it
We really loved eachother, somethin we should always do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
We had Tenchi too - we had plans on watchin him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein you leave, or watchin you go

Listen listen listen.. (listen) whoahh (listen)
Listen listen listen.. (better listen) whoahh-oahhh-oahhh
Listen listen listen.. {*harmonizing*}
Listen.. mmm-mmm-mmm 
[Ayeka] + {Ryoko}
If you wanna know why.. {why I live my life}
The way that I do.. {cause I got to get this money}
So don't worry about me.. {cause I know my way around}
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper 
[Nobyuki]
Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with friends from the past, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from father, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a woman, a lover, and a mother
I spoke to our son, the other day, and told him his father's got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin you get it, but no one can choose the card they was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
to straight breakin down and showin all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real men don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no man
It's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you
