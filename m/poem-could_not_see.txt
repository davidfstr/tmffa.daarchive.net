     they couldn't see it in there eyes,
     but they really do care.
     thay held hands very few times,
     but their love shows.
     they couldn't see the love they shared with each other.
     though,it was in plain sight.
     maybe they didn't want to know.
     maybe they didn't know it showed,
     but there love,it was still there.
