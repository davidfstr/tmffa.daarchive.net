Mystery Science Theater 2999 1/3
Cue Season 6 Theme

Sattelite of Love
7:54 P.M EST

	Another quiet day on the SOL. In fact, it always is. 
Since they are out in space, there is no weather and gravity, so it is just...well old.
 The only source of entertainment was making the  invention and the Holocabana. Oh 
sure... like the fanfic counts. Mike was twisting the knobs on  his latest invention, that was 
partailly out of view of cambot's eyepiece. Meanwhile, Crow And Tom were in the Holocabana,
making there own version of the AAA finals.
	Entering HoloCabana Room.....
	"MAH GOD!" yelled Ric. "Kintobar just beat the Saiyen-Jin!"
	"We should expect Pippkin to come by very soon" shouted Tenay.
	But it wasn't the bunny. Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo came from above with two M-16's
 in hand, which Tom's was glues on!
	"Take that, Cyber Fox!!" yelled Crow, landing on the Fox...and biting him.
	"WHAT IS HAPPENING!?!" yelled JR. "Crow and Servo have gone POSTAL!"
	Tom Servo started shooting the Hermaphodite on the ground. Meanwhile, Crow was
brigning Kintobar down with his dangerous bites. Finnaly, The Fox went down, his prism rifle
sliding across the ring.
	" 1--2--3!! Looks like Crow and Servo get the AAA title" shouted Tenay excitedly.
	"We'll talk to them after this commercial break!" said JB, hitting the commercial button
****************************************************************************
[Scene shows the Neo-Tokyo arena, after the match. The Janitor is cleaning
 in the background. in front of the camera shows Artemis]
Artemis: Hello. I'm Artemis. You know how that [looking around] that idiotic
 twit writes me that way in fanfics. Well, it's not true! Luna and I are 
happily together and Oscar invades our privacy! If you want to help me kill
 Oscar, Call this number below
[Number flashes 1-800-HELP-NOW]
[Oscar runs into the room, in bandages]
Oscar: Come on, Artemis. We got a lovely night ahead of us!
Artemis: HELP!! 
[Artemis runs offstage]
****************************************************************************
	"And we are back" said Tenay. Ric and JR were too busy talking to Crow 
and Servo.
	"How does it feel to win the tournament, Crow and Servo?" asked JR.
	"Well...it feels great" said the bots simultaniously. But before the 
conversation went any further, the klaxon's went out.	"Looks, guys" started
 the red bot. "We gotta go. See-ya!" They quickly turned off the Holocabana
 and the balsa sides come on. They went to everyone's favorite spot, the 
bridge and saw a very happy Dr. Forrester on the HectoScreen
	"Greetings, Primates. How is the jungle today?" deviously said Clayton.
 He was wearing a hawaiian tanktop and shorts that was rather odd, especially
 around Deep 13. Frank wore something similar to it.
	"Doing just fine, sirs." said Mike.
	"And why the hell are you dressed up as a loser" snickered Crow.
	"I'll ignore that and tell you in a sec." said the Doc. "I'll go first
 with today's invention."
	"If you say so" said Servo. Dr.F held up a small machine with a comb
 attached on the end of it, while Frank explained it.
	"You know how people hate combing their hair in the mornings?" said
 Frank. "This device will supposedly say that it will fix that, but it will
 instead mess it up even more, causing bad haird days and people in robes 
going postal on the streets." Dr. F turned it on and quickly used it on Frank. 
At the end of the Ordeal, Frank had a Marge Simpson on steriods look.
	"I will then make people pay to fix that!" said the diabolical
doc. "What do you think?"
	"It's nice sir, but then people can get a comb and fix it." replied
 Mike.
	"Ahh...poopie." said Dr.F, throwing his invention on the ground, 
smashing it to 3 pieces.
	Mike held up a small handheld computer type device with a mix of a
 scanner.
	"You know when you have to read those bad books with the bad scenes?" 
started Crow. "Well, this device scans the entire book and tells the reader if
it's good enough to read!"
	"We call it the Ultima Scanner" said Mike
	"Why do we name all our stuff with Ultima?" asked Crow.
	"Frankly....I don't know" said Mike.
	"It also makes Waffles" yelled Servo. Mike demonstrated by placing a 
copy of the second doom novel on the scanner. The scanner quickly read it.
	"Warning: Too much lemon" said the scanner.  Dr. F shivered. If he
 saw that device on the market, say goodbye to bad books! But then he 
remembered what the scanner actually meant.
	"It's referring to the scene where Flynn Taggart and the others have
 to use lemon's to  smell like the zombies" said Dr.F. "Now, about your 
earlier question. Frank and I are were thinking about a little vacation."
	The SOL was in party mode. 
	"HOORAYY!" yelled Servo.
	"NO MORE FANFICS" yelled Crow.
	"So we checked for *babysitters*"  demonically said Dr. F
	Party Mode was gone.
	"Who?" asked Mike, shivering at the possibilites.
	"Well, we tried Oscar, but he was bugging Hentai Space"
	The three on board shivered.
	"And then Kintobar, but he is busy drinking and partying after AAA."
	The three shivered again.
	"Nav was also busy... but all he mentioned something about upgrading
 to M-60's"
	The three stopped shivering.
	"GO NAV!" Yelled the golden boy with the beak.
	"And none of the others won't do it."
	"Cool!" yelled Magic Voice, all of a sudden.
	"And then I tried everyone else, and nothing worked, So now we can't
 go on the vacation and it just sucks."
	"Yeah" said Servo
	"And now that I have explained what I was about to do, I'm just so
 god damn pissed off now!!!" Dr.F said, starting to cry now.
	"It's ok, Sir" said Frank, patting him on the shoulder.
	"There, There, Dr.F" said Mike. "Just send us our fic."
	"Why thats..." started Dr. Forrester, eyes gleaming again. "Why thats 
what I'll just do!"
	"Great job, Mike" Yelled Crow.
	"Your fic is a Prolouge to Armageddon Prophecy that I forgot to send 
last time, and a short called Tenchi Vrs. Ranma. Enjoy!" said Dr.F, back to 
his old self again.
	"We are gonna GET YOU, Mike" yelled Servo. The Fanfic Sign button 
went off.
	"No you can't, because it's QUICKIE SIGN!!" yelled Mike, entering
 the Theater.

(The three enter the theater)
Tom: Your gonna get it, Mike
Mike: It was a accident!
Crow: Yeah... and your fate is sealed!

>Date: Mon, 22 Jun 1998 04:48:33 -0400

Mike: A date that would go down in history as the quickie from hell.

>From: Replicant <replicant@NorthState.Net>
>Subject: Re: Okok.... What about Tenchi Vrs. Ranma?
>To: tenchi@ML.usagi.org

Magic Voice: Hey! That's like the Q I asked on it!
Tom: It's YOUR FAULT THEN!!
Magic Voice: I'll shut up. 

 >Everyone's thinking on Tenchi vrs Kuno or Tenchi Vrs. Mouse... 

Crow: They actually thought about that?
Magic Voice: Yeah! Wierd huh?
Mike: But it could be Tenchi vrs. Marissa or Tenchi Vrs Oscar.....
ALL: (Shudder)

>but who would win

Tom: If they all were in a mud match?
Mike: You sound like your old *non-hurting* self
Tom: Do I? I'm still kicking your ass, Mike.
Mike: (Groans)

>in a Tenchi Vrs. Ranma match? My vote would be on Tenchi!

Crow: (Bet Dude) Place yer bets! Odds are Ranma: 5-1 and Tenchi: 20,000-1
Magic Voice: That was mean! Tenchi Rules!
Crow: Yeah... but Ranma is the better martial artist...
Magic Voice: Oh yeah...

>
>The Answer: Illustrated in Anime form!

Mike: Phew! I thought it would be writing form...
Tom: Or script form...
Crow: or in first person form...

>The Scene: Tenchi w/LHW facing Ranma with Katana(I guess!)

Tom: You know, just having a bucket of water would scare off Tenchi
Mike: and why is that
Tom: Once he changes into Chan form, Tenchi would be freaked out.
Crow: Or call the local freak show.

>Imagery: They are standing in front of the Misaki Shrine with the wind fiercely
>blowing 

Mike: ...them away..
Crow: Damn You, El Nino!!

>and the skies darkening from the power being used.

Crow: So El Nino DOES play a vital role in this battle

> The Tenchi cast along
>with the Ranma cast are watching and intensely waiting or the first move.

Mike: (Ranma) I'll move my king this way...
Crow: (Tenchi) and I will move my rook and.... wow...already checkmate!
Mike: (Ranma) Damnit!

>The Battle: Tenchi eyes Ranma with fear and anger swelling inside of him. 

Tom: And suddenly, he bursts like a baloon. The swelling was just TOO MUCH!

>Ranma shows 

Crow: Himself...
Mike: Crow....

>careful attention to the position of Tenchi's sword and his feet. Looking for
>a weakness.

Crow: Now that is just too easy! (Snickers at it still)
Mike: Crow....not again.

>Tenchi: "Why have you challenged me?"

Tom: (Tenchi) I didn't. It was Mihoshi's fault for saying that stuff about
your porno pics!
Mike: Not you too!

>Ranma: "I heard that you said that you were better than me!"

Crow: (Tenchi) Well, I'm better with girls
Mike: CROW!! (grabs the XVB-10XA super glue formula B and puts in on his
mouth)
Crow: MMPH!!
Tom: You sound like Kenny, Crow! (Turns to Mike) Can we kill him?
Mike: No. Well...not yet anyway.
Crow: MMMMMPHHHH!!!

>Tenchi: "I said no such thing. Someone has lied to you."
>(Happosai smiles in the background and checks out Aeka)

Tom: (Happiosai) I see London, I see France.....
Mike: You need a super glue special too?
Tom : (Sympathic Tone) No..
Mike: Then stop.

>An acorn from a nearby tree falls and startles Tenchi causing him to jump.

Tom: An acrorn did that? Tenchi must be weak!
Mike: The Deadly Acorn from hell, coming soon to a theater near you.

>Ranma sees this as an action of 

Crow: (finnaly getting Supe Glue off) stupidity!
Mike: I need to buy a better brand of glue.

>attack and runs in to slash Tenchi.
>With his/her sword raised 

Tom: Hehehe
Mike: CROW!
Tom: It was me, Mike.
Mike: Oh...TOM!!
Crow: Stop stealing my schtick!

>preparing for battle, Ranma's world suddenly grows dark
>and he slumps to the ground.

Mike: Presenting the Laz-E-Dirt! You can sit unconsious for hours!

> The last thing he hears is a mad laughter 

Crow: Is 'Kefka: The Dark One' in this fic?
Others: Who?
Crow: Uhh...never mind.

>and the words

Tom: (Eric Cartman) SCREW YOU, HIPPIE!
Crow: YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.
Mike: I'm a little teapot?
[The Bots stare at Mike]
Mike: What?

>"Watch it buster, he's mine."

Tom: Is Ranma Buster Bunny?
Mike: Don't think Tom... just smile and nod.

>Tenchi looks at the fallen Ranma and looks up to see

Crow: ARMAGEDDON!!! RUN!! [Starts to ram into the theater door, but bangs
his head on it] Ouchie....
Mike: Don't put your simulation's to the extreme again, Crow.
Crow: I won't try that again.

> what had taken him down.

Tom: You know, it could be Akane. I mean, she could be pissed at Ranma right
now.
Crow: Or it could also be Ryouga. He hates Ranma
Mike: Or it could be Ukyou with a spatuala...but I doubt it.
Crow: Spatula Attack! Run!! [Bangs head on the door trying to escape again.
he now has a dent.]
Crow: Ouch! That hurts!
Mike: I warned ya!

>(Ryoko Smiles, still clutching Mayuka who she had used as a bat to hit him from
>behind with.)

ALL: WHAT THE!!??!!
Mike: Call the POLICE!!! We have a child abuser!!
Tom:(Announcer) It's the bottem of the 9th, two outs and bases are loaded
Crow: (Some other Announcer) Ryoko is to the plate and a normal bat will
not do for the game tonight! 
Tom: (Ditto) She grabs the special Mayuka Bat and swings away! HOME RUN!
Crow: (Ditto) But the Bat (Mayuka) is broken in several different places!
Tom: (Ditto) Order your own Mayuka Louisville Slugger Bat today.

>Tenchi: "Put Mayuka down, right now."

Mike: But Ryoko doesn't agree and she throws Mayuka Hammer Throw Style
Tom: (Mayuka) Please Ryoko, I'm getting dizzzyyyy...... (Pretends to be 
thrown) AHHH!!!

>(Ryoko drops Mayuka with a thud)

ALL: THUD!
Tom: (Mayuka) I'm gonna sue your ass now, Ryoko

>Tenchi: "Why did you do that? I can take care of myself."

Crow" Because *I* want to take care of *you*
Mike: CROW!!!

>(Ryoko teleports beside of Tenchi and drops to her knees, clutching his legs in a
>passionate hug)

Tom: (Ryoko) Please take me to Happy World Land now... YOU PROMISED!! PLEASE?
PLEASE? PLEASE? 
Mike: That's enough, Tom.

>Ryoko: "I'm sorrrry Tenchi. He was trying to hurt you and I couldn't let him do
>that."

Mike: (Ryoko) But Mayuka pissed me off last night while watching TV, so I just
HAD to!

>Ryoko: " You know I only meant well."

Tom: Yes... she meant well. But Tenchi threw her down the well in return
for her favor!

>(She looks up at Tenchi with caring and apologetic eyes)

Crow: (Ryoko) Can we *PLEASE*  keep this adorable little Pig thingie here?
Tom: (Tenchi) No... you'll burn it in the microwave again
Mike: (P-Chan) WHAT!!??!

>Tenchi: "I know, but let me do the fighting next time, OK?"

Tom: (Ryoko) If I did, then your ass would have been kicked! And I want it
intact!
Mike: [Groans]

>Ryoko: "Anything you want Tenchi darling. Now, lets go get something to eat, I'm
>starving."

Bots: [Snickers]
Mike: No.
Bots: Come on!
Mike: I'm sorry....no.
>(The Tenchi walks over and scoops up Mayuka)

Crow: The newest Ben and Jerry flavor! Mayuka-Chan 
Mike: With crunchy little baseball bats with it.
Tom: Watch as THE Tenchi takes you by surprise

>Tenchi: "Are you o.k. Mayuka-chan?"

Tom: (Mayuka) OH, I'm fine. Your girlfriend just beat the crap outta your
opponet using me, while my medical bills have just skyrocketed! Oh I'm fine!

>Mayuka: "Yes. I'm fine, but my head hurts a little. What happened?"

Crow: (Tenchi) You got screwed.
Mike: Crow...
Tom: Well, screwed was used as a different meaning this time, Mike. I mean
screwed in Crow's meaning is that she was in a very bad situation.
Mike: Oh...

>Tenchi: " I'll tell you later, lets go get you something to eat."
>Mayuka: "Thank you, daddy."

Crow: (Mayuka) Hehe.. It's fun to eat something after being used as a 
personal weapon!

>Tenchi and the cast of Tenchi walk toward the Misaki household for dinner, leaving

Tom: Their LAST dinner...
Crow: Akane cooked up a little surprise for the winners...

>the confused and shocked Ranma cast behind to gather their warrior.

Mike: (Genma) Some warrior you are. Go and fetch me some food now!

>My Theory,

Crow: Well, my theroey is that all the fanfics we read suck!
Mike: That's because it's Dr.F's Experiment
Crow: Oh yeah..

>Replicant

Mike: (George Bush) Read my Lips...
Bots: NO BAD FANFICS!

>"Yuzuha is Yuzuha,
> Mayuka is Mayuka." - Mayuka

Tom: And we don't CARE who is who!
Mike: Come on...lets go...

[Door 2: It's a a small paper opening.]
[Door 3: It's a stack of Metallica CD's. You put the one you got earlier back]

	"Ok" said Mike, getting out of the theater. "Have you thought
on how your match of Tenchi Vrs. Ranma would go?
	"Why, Yes I have" said Crow. "My Match wold be like this. Each
one of the fighters would each have a Surge, Jolt, and A Citra. They
start to go crazy and suddenly, they fight. This goes on for a while and
then Ryoko and Akane get into a fight, and then the whole cast gets into
a huge Jerry Springer fight. Then a nuke goes off and everyone dies."
	"O....k" said Mike, turning to Servo. "What is yours, Tom?"
	"Mine is that they just fight and one wins" said Tom
	"Thats nice. You didn't think very much did you" asked Mike.
	"No."
	"Ok. And here is mine." The Mike realized that he didn't think 
of anything! So, he had to think of a demented thing quick!
" A deranged little elf interuppts the fight and tells them to share. 
They kick the ass of the elf and then stop fighting"
Mike said.
	"Mike?" said the Bots.
	"Remember how we said we are gonna kick your ass?"  said Crow.
	"Yeah"
	"Well... Crow's gonna be Tenchi" stated Tom, "And I will be Ranma"
	"And..." said Mike.
	"Your the Deranged little elf" said Crow. 
	"Oh"
	"GET HIM!!" yelled the Two Bots as they chased Mike. Then, all of a
sudden, Gypsy appeared on the bridge.
	"Uhh... We'll be right back" she said, hitting the commercial sign
button.
