Title: 12 Days of Tsunami
Division: Misc
Synopsis: Something me and my friend did in Japanese Class (Mostly me...
Just
kidding Jon!). A few author notes: I know there's only 1 Master/Key
Tenchi-ken. 8 People are the main cast, without Yosho (Gomen to all the
Yosho
fans).

Chorus:
On the (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)Day of Christmas Tsunami gave to me:

Ryoko Drunk in a tree
2 Carrot Fields
3 Light Hawk Swords!
4 Washu Dolls
5 Master Keys!
6 Juraian Guardsmen
7 Guardians a Spinning
8 People Singing
9 GP's Humming
10 LIGHT HAWK WINGS!
11 Sake cups Draining
12 Ryo-Ohki!

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
