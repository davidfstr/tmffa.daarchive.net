Captain's Log
050602
We have left Earth orbit and are now out in deep space. Washu has allowed Ayeka to use her portal to get here, 
so we have set out into the night. (_Someone's_ taking a creative writing class ^__~ ) <Bite me, author.> 
Anyway, we have our second lemon. 
On a side note: Gene finally has rejoined the crew, somewhat worse for wear...
End Log 

[Begin Record]

INT: The theater. The MST Team and the off duty crew are watching Leena down in the firing range. 
She has destroyed most of the drones facing her, the last few have given up and are making a run for it. 
Leena (On P.A.): Running away? Are you scared? Good! <Insert her laugh here> (Blasts away)
The last drone drops. Leena returns her GS to the hanger as the computer tallies the score.
Computer (Mils Lane) Target Score: One hundred percent! Accuracy: Fifty-six percent!
Total score: Seventy-eight percent!
Leena: Humph, that's about right.
She heads back to the theater.
The crew has left the theater, leaving only the MST Team.
(Seating Ayeka, Leena, Steele, Gene)

<WARNING...WARNING...THE FOLLOWING FAN FIC WAS FOUND IN THE 'LEMON' SECTION...PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK...>

Ayeka: Great, new group, the first fic is a lemon. At least tell me I get Lord Tenchi!
Steele: Honestly I don't know. (Points up at Author) He won't let me read ahead anymore! {Told you I'd get you back!}
Waspinator: Patch crew to theater, fourth wall haz been breached!

[Fic starts]

>Hello

All: Buh Bye!! (Get up. Max is in the doorway, lasers armed.) We'll be good! (Sit back down)

>This is a lemon; if you don't know what a lemon is, then how did you get here?

Steele: Evil plans of the Author.
Leena: Ditto
Gene: Free beer
Ayeka: Washu said it was fun...
Waspinator: Zteady pay.

>Never mind, as always this story contains sexual situations involving characters 
>I do not own.

>Ok. The legal mumbo jumbo: All characters are property of AIC and Pioneer.

>Be careful what you wish for, you may just get it!

(Metallica's 'King Nothing' plays briefly)
All: What the...?

>The Wish: By Truly Mad

Steele (ReBoot's Bob): This is bad, very bad.

>"WHAT!!!!"
>!!! KABOOM!!!

Waspinator: INCOMING!
Gene: Beast Wars flashback. It'll pass.

>It was your typical morning in the Masaki household, Ayeka was getting shot at 
>by Ryoko, 

Steele: Check!

>Mihoshi was sleeping through it, 

Gene: Check!

>Sasami was cooking with RyoOhki not 
>to far behind,

Leena: Check!

>Washu was in her lab 

Waspinator: Check!

>and Kiyone had just given up and went to 
>commit suicide, 

Ayeka: Che...Huh?!

as for Nobuyuki, he was with Grandpa at the shrine.

Steele: Forget the hentai and the geezer, what's this about Kiyone committing suicide??!!
Ayeka: You would think I would remember such a thing happening.

>Tenchi woke with the usual feeling that Ryoko would be there as soon as he 
>opened his eyes, but, NO!

Gene (Robby the Robot): Warning, warning, broken Tenchi Muyo stereotype!

>Ryoko was nowhere to be seen in his room, Tenchi thought it strange and walk to 
>the bathroom, still no sign of Ryoko.

Leena: Pick a tense and stick with it!

>Ryoko had manage to keep the fight

Gene: Who is she? Don King?
Ayeka: Well there is a certain resemblance in the hair...
(Suddenly a plasma bolt shoots in, and grazes Ayeka's hair)
Ryoko's voice: Ha, got ya!

> with Ayeka going all the way to the Flying 
>Onsen, at this point they gave up and just bathed together, they nude forms just 
>visible through the water.
Gene: WOOOO HOOOOO
Leena: Steele, duck!
(Ayeka shoots Gene several times)

>At this point Ayeka started to daydream, and realised she was dreaming of having 
>hot lesbian sex with Ryoko, Right there Right now!

Gene (Still smoking): Finally, some girl-on-girl action!!
(Ayeka's log field surrounds him, but before she zaps him, a plasma bolt fries him. Then Ayeka zaps him for good measure)

>As Ayeka was never very good at acting on impulse she just forgot about it.

Steele: That was pointless.

>=^^=

Leena (Ranma): CCCCCCCCAT!!!!!!

>Evening started to form early over the Misaki house and everyone was gathered 
>round the table for the meal Sasami had cooked, all but Washu...

All: Dun, dun, dunnnnnn!

>" Tenchi would you be a dear and get Washu?" asked Sasami

Leena: Ayeka, does your sister _hate_ Tenchi?
Ayeka: No! She's just...young.

>" Ok," Tenchi said reluctantly, as he new what might happen as soon as he 
>stepped into the lab.

Leena (Washu): Tenchi! Time for that sample!
Ayeka: How does she do that?
Steele: That's nothing, watch this!
Steele (Ayeka): I'll get you Ryoko!
Ayeka: Wow, how'd you do that?!
Steele: It's text. I can sound like anyone.
Waspinator: Patch crew back to the theater!

>Washu was hard at work on a new invention, it was for lack of better 
>description, a Wish Machine, but it could only grant one wish, and Washu new 
>what that was going to be!!!!

Ayeka (Washu): I wish I was taller! 
Others (Try to shush her, to no avail)
Washu's voice: That's it, Princess! (Turns Ayeka into a kappa) And you'll stay that way until I feel like changing you back! 

>" Little Washu, meals ready!" tenchi said with a nervous glint in his eye, that 
>soon disappeared as he noticed Washu's ample ass 

Gene: Uh, can she turn Fic Tenchi into a kappa?
Leena: If anyone could, it would be Little Washu.
Ayeka: QWACK! (HELP ME!)

>sticking out the back of this 
>machine. Being a Son of Nobuyuki, 

Steele: While I would not be surprised at Tenchi NOT being an only child,
 why is there no mention of the other 'Sons of Nobuyuki'?
Gene: Well, there was 'Gene Masaki'
Steele: (Hits him with Lightmallet®) That fic sucked!

>his cock was already at attention and ready 
>for action.

Steele (Drill instructor): ATTENTION! YOU MAGGOTS ARE NOT FIT TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM!!
Ayeka: QWACK QWACK QWA QWACK QWACK (Pretty Little Washu, please change me back!)
Washu's voice: OK, only because you asked so nicely (Ayeka changes back)
Ayeka: Phew! 

>Lust soon took over and he lined up behind Washu, ready to attack. Just as he 
>was about to jump her, she turned round, " Now now Tenchi, we can't have you 
>doing that!" Washu said as she started to blush at the thought of his cock in 
>her.

Steele & Leena: Ahh, pedophile pedophile!!

>Tenchi ran, but didn't get far before he was caught by one of Washu's drones, he 
>was dragged back kicking and screaming, unlike Tenchi and Ayeka, Washu likes to 
>act on impulse.

Gene (Sulu): Impulse engines have failed captain!

>Being held tightly in the drones many arms, Washu proceeded to remove Tenchi's 
>shorts and stick his cock in her mouth

Ayeka: Lord Tenchi NO!!!!
Leena: Ayeka, remember it's just a fic.
Ayeka (Now chanting) It is just a fic, It is just a fic, It is just a fic, It is just a fic...

>" WASHU!" Tenchi shouted but he soon realised how great it felt as his rock hard 
>member slid in and out of Washu's waiting mouth.

Gene: Well, it's not yuri, but it'll do.
Others: (Ignore him.)

>She went faster and faster until tenchi couldn't hold it no more and he let his 
>cum fly down Washu's mouth, she sucked his cock dry and after proceeded to 
>undress...

Steele (To Leena): Can you think of anything?
Leena (To Steele): No. You?
Ayeka (Still chanting): It is just a fic, It is just a fic, It is just a fic, It is just a fic...

>" Are you sure we should be doing this? Sasami has food ready," Tenchi said 

Leena: Does that boy think of nothing but food?
Gene: After a BJ like that, I'd not be thinking of anything!
Leena & Steele: You think now?

>panting at the mind-blowing blowjob he just had.
>" Of course!" Washu shouted with glee and a mad glint to her smile.

All: We really shouldn't. Ah, what the hell... EVIL!
(Several nervous seconds later, nothing happens)
 
>She released the restraints holding Tenchi and he flew at her with his rock hard 
>cock ready again.
>He entered washu's waiting cunt with such force he nearly sent her flying.

Leena: Into a wall, killing her, ending this lemon.
Steele: Whoa, dark!

>"OH GOD HE'S GOOD!" Washu thought to herself as Tenchi started banging his cock 
>hard into her, her love juices flowing from her cunt, her body shaking at the 
>orgasm that was welling up inside her.
>Tenchi decided he didn't like the missionary position and so proceeded to turn 

Steele: Himself into the police for being a pedophile.

>Washu round and take her from behind, once more, he banged into her mercilessly 
>and continued where he left of. Feeling that he couldn't hold out much longer, 
>he started to go faster and harder, giving Washu the pleasuring of her life, her 
>orgasm flowed over her, making her body convulse in a way she hadn't felt for 
>centuries, and at this Tenchi shot his load deep inside of her, claiming his 
>prize.

Leena (Girl at a carnival) Oh, can I have the stuffed bear?!

>" Woah that was good, was that your first time my little guinea pig?" washu 
>asked out of breath, as her sweating naked form lay there next to Tenchi.

Leena: Her spirit having left her for doing such a horrible thing.
Ayeka: That is MY Lord Tenchi you are talking about!
Gene: Not anymore he isn't!
Ayeka: (Incoherent scream)

>" Yes, that was fantastic, thank you little washu," Tenchi said.
>" I'm not through yet!" Washu said with a mad smile as she got dressed and moved 
>towards the wish machine, she pushed some buttons and the machine sprang to 
>life.

Gene, Steele, Leena (Animaniacs): Boingy, Boingy, Boingy!

>" I WISH THAT FOR THE NEXT HOUR, TENCHI COULD NOT TELL A LIE, BUT >ONLY THE 
>TRUTH!" 

Gene (Jack Nicholson): YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!

>Washu bellowed out at the machine. Lights and sounds unfamiliar to 
>Tenchi surrounded him, and almost as soon as it started, it was over.

All: YAY!!!!
(Get up, Max is still in the doorway, lasers still armed)
All: DAMN!!
(Sit back down)

>" What just happened?" tenchi asked nervously

Leena: You just had sex with a 20,000.00 year old woman, 
who looks like she's twelve. She then wished you could only tell the truth for one hour.
Steele: Wow, two and a half pages of lemon and sort-of-plot in two sentences.

>" For the next hour you cannot tell a lie!" washu said informatively, and 
>grabbed Tenchi by the hand and dragged him out of the lab, towards the living 
>room where the others had finished eating and were watching TV.

Gene: And they forgot about Tenchi and Washu, how?
Ayeka (Herself): Sasami, where are Tenchi and Washu?
Leena (Sasami): I asked Tenchi to call Washu to dinner about an hour ago.
Ayeka (Still herself): Oh, okay then...

>There viewing pleasure of the TV was interrupted by the viewing of Tenchi's 
>naked form being pushed into the living room.
>" Oh my!" thought Ayeka, as she felt her self getting wet from seeing her love's 
>naked form.

Leena (Ayeka): Oh dear, I spilled my tea!
Others: (Snicker)

>" Woah!" Ryoko Shouted as she to felt herself getting wet.

Ayeka (Ryoko): Whoops; spilled my sake!
All: (Laugh)

>" Ok, for the next hour, Tenchi cannot tell a LIE! So ask him whatever you 
>want!" Washu said, she the left with a smirk on her face, back to her lab.

Ayeka (Herself again): Say Washu, why are you and Tenchi naked?
Leena (Washu): Oh, no reason!

>" Hi girls," tenchi said, disgusted that washu has put him this position after 
>he gave her the best sex she had had in a few years....

Gene: Few thousand maybe...
Steele: And Tenchi would know this, how?
Leena: Just like a guy, always think they're the best.
Steele, Gene and Waspinator: HEY!

>" Ok tenchi, who do you love, me or Ayeka?" Ryoko asked plainly, waiting for the 
>answer she wanted to hear.

Steele (Tenchi): Uh, can I phone a friend? How about poll the audience?

>" I love your Ryoko!" Tenchi shouted, and banging his head in, as he couldn't 
>believe what he just said.

Ayeka: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>" REALLY! OH MY GOD!" Ryoko shouted as she disappeared, only to reappear round 
>tenchi's neck kissing him on the lips, tongues entangled.
>" But what about me?" Ayeka sad with tears streaming down her face.
>" Ayeka, your more like an annoying sister, so why don't you go back to where 
>ever it its you came from and LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!!!!!!!!" 

Steele: While that is SO OOC, it is true, Ayeka. You are his great aunt.
Ayeka: I know, I know. It's just, look at the alternative.
All: Serio. (Shudder)

>Tenchi couldn't believe he just said that and started banging his head against 
>the wall as Ayeka walked into the kitchen, picked up a knife and went into the 
>garden, sat next to a tree where the limp corpse a kiyone, who had hung herself 
>earlier, hung and stabbed herself in the chest several times before falling over 
>and dying in her own blood.

Gene: Wow, fic Ayeka really wanted to die!
Steele: And we still don't know what set Kiyone off.
Ayeka: Yes we do: Mihoshi.
Gene: I don't know. I can't believe Kiyone would kill herself to be rid of Mihoshi.
Leena: No, she'd kill Mihoshi.
Steele: And being a GP, she could do it and get away with it.

>" And me?" Mihoshi chirped
>" Mihoshi, I like you and if you stick around maybe me and Ryoko with let you 
>have a 3some with us," tenchi said quite cheerily now that Ayeka had gone.

Gene: YES!!!!!!!
Leena: (Jumps up, mallets Gene HARD, then calmly sits back down.

>"YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!" Mihoshi shouted >and ran around like 
>an idiot until she fell over conveniently placed vase.

All: WASHU?!
Washu's Voice: Not me!

>" And me?" sasami said
>" Oh sasami, I would like to give you a good banging but the writer won't let 
>me," said tenchi

ALL (Including the characters in the fic) THANK TSUNAMI!!!!!!!!

>Note: LEAVE ME OUT OF IT!!!! Writer

Steele: No way, you got us into this, you have to suffer like the rest of us.

>" Ok, maybe later," Sasami said as she headed to the kitchen to get some food.

Gene: Yes, back to work, slave-girl.

>" Im so happy, make love to me right here!" said Ryoko as she started stripping 
>to reveal her perfect body, her legs glistening from were she had started 
>getting wet.

Leena: Ewwww, dried sake!

>Tenchi had no problems with this and bent ryoko over the couch and took her from 
>behind, being softer this time, as he wanted to show his true love for her, and 
>as he pressed his cock into her, to hear her gasps of pleasure 

Steele: He wants to show his 'true love', so he does her doggie-style (as Dr. Evil) Riiiiiiiiiiight.

>he said " I love 
>you Ryoko!"
>I love you to Tenchi," she replied as she felt him slide in and out of her, 
>slowly feeling his cock press into her pussy. She could feel a well of emotion 
>flow over as she felt joy, happiness and love, for the one she cared for the 
>most was pushing himself in and out of her.
>He felt the same, in a way as there bodies became one, so did their thoughts, as 
>Ryoko came to orgasm, tenchi came and let his seed flow into his love. After 
>they both recovered, Tenchi carried Ryoko to his bedroom, where as he flung the 
>door open, Mihoshi lay on the bed, her body ready for action.

>But that will be another time..........

All (Minus Gene): GODDAMMIT!!!
Gene: WOOOHOOOO!

>Ok, hope you enjoyed, most noticeably this is my first story and as such, 
>spelling and punctuation be DAMMED!

Leena: Spelling, punctuation?
Steele: Yeah, we kind of forgot, didn't we? Eh. Next time.

>If you enjoyed, I would love to here comments and Critiscm: Cephirio@aol.com

>Hopefully more soon!

>Truly Mad

Steele & Leena: You said it pal, not me!

[Fic Ends]

INT: Ready room. The MST Team are gathered for the post-fic wrap up.

Gene: Now that wasn't too bad, was it?
Ayeka: I commited suicide!!
Steele: Yeah, you and Kiyone.
Leena: At least it wasn't drawn out or too detailed. I hate deathfics.
Steele: Then it's a good thing I left that one off the playlist, then.
Leena: Which one?
Steele: That song that Melfina sings, Gene?
Gene: Hiru No Tsuki? What of it?
Steele: Ryoko commits suicide to it.
Others: Ewwwww.
Leena: That's sick!
Steele: Tell me about it.
Leena (Quickly changing topic): Well this one wasn't too bad then.
Steele: Yeah, as lemons go.
(The portal back to Washu's lab opens)
Ayeka: Well. It is time for me to get back. Tenchi may have chosen in the fic, but he is still available in my universe.
Steele (To Leena): Should we tell her?
Leena: (To Steele): Not a good idea.
Both: Goodbye, Ayeka!
Gene: Later.
Ayeka: Farewell. (Steps through)
Steele: Phew, safe!
Leena: Back to Melfina, Gene?
Gene: Not yet. I think I need to heal up first, she's too rough sometimes.
Steele & Leena: TOO MUCH INFO!!!

End Record

Captain's Log:
We remain on our course, taking a grand tour of the galaxy. The MST went as well as could be expected. Gene is still in 
borrowed quarters. Hopefully he will head  back to the Outlaw Star soon.
I have no desire to have a crazed Melfina loosed on the ship...
End Log

Author's notes:
Another one bites the dust! I just wanted to expand on the whole deathfic issue. 
I don't want to get off on a rant here but don't understand the process that leads one to write one, 
I can't fathom why people read them. To expend that much time and creative energy just to write a story in which a major 
character in a show commits homicide/suicide I think is a sign of some serious psychological problems. But that's just me. 
Also I got the song title from my OLS DVD. 
Anyway this was an okay lemon, if a little cliched. 

As always, comments and criticisms go to jgibb@adelphia.net. Flames are used for terrorist flambé.

REMEMBER 09/11/2001!!!

MSTs FOREVER!!
