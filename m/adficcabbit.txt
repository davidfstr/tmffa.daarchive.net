The original version was written on the WWWBoard for a fighting tournament
fanfiction known as the MVFC, using Q-Bee from Darkstalkers.  This is,
however, more gratifying and destructive.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

[The song "Danger Zone" is playing in the background.  A car passes a tree
where we find a couple of cabbits sitting around.  Cut to a shot of the
cabbits, communicating through headsets.]

Cabbit 1:  Miya!

Cabbit 2:  Miya!

Cabbit on headset:  Mi-ya.

[The two cabbits change into ship form, and start flying after the car.
The car manages to avoid the random blasts coming from the ships;
unfortunately for the landscape, it doesn't seem to be able to move fast
enough.]

Cabbit 1:  Miyaa...

[Switch to a third cabbit on a headset - this one being Ryo-ohki.]

Ryo-ohki:  Miya.

[Ryo-ohki changes into ship form and flies low and fast in an effort to
catch up to and summarily nuke the car.]

Ryo-ohki:  Miiya...miiya...

[The car finally pulls into a garage, and the door closes behind it.
Ryo-ohki happens to be rather close to the door afterward, and traveling
at a rather disturbing vector in relation to said garage door.]

Ryo-ohki:  MIYA-

[The house does not react favorably to the force equation of a ship's mass
accelerating pieces of the house in such a fashion.  Ryo-ohki decides to
cutely change back in a vain effort to appear innocent among the rubble.]

Ryo-ohki:  Miya...

[Meanwhile, a Chinese man and his dog are standing along the road.  The
Chinese man seems to find the situation amusing.  The sentence, "Enjoy the
ride," appears just below the Nissan logo as the commercial ends.]

-------------------------------------------------------------

One more's being toyed with...frightening, isn't it?
