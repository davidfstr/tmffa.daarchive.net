An MST by Steve

Email: psychosteve999@yahoo.com

All the characters depicted in this story are of my own creation with
the
following exceptions:

      Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Psychotic killer created by the one
and only Jhonen Vasquez.
      Crow T. Robot: That lovable golden robot from the "MST3K" TV show.

These are my original Characters:

 Sharrin Bowman: An oppressed fifteen-year-old goth/skater female
featured in a book I wrote entitled "Frogs 2: Toads".
 Psycho Steve: Pretty much a self insertion into the story.  Psycho
Steve is one of the nicknames I am known under.  Others include Evil
Steve,Whisper, and White Steve.
 Till: A seven-foot-tall German Dragon named after Rammstein's
vocalist.  This Character is featured in a sort of Quentin Tarintino
meets Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy my step-brother Andy and I came up
with.
 Nastica: Till's girlfriend who appears in the third installment of the
trilogy. Originally a dragon as well (a Russian one for a particualr
reason) was later transformed into an American 100% human goth chick.
Hey, I have a fetish for gothic girls, sue me.

These six brave souls have been forced to view really bad fanfics by
satanic stringbeans that came out of hell after Till agreed to sell his
soul to them for a gallon of vodka.  Afterwards realizing what a stupid
thing he had done Till would not give the stringbeans his soul.  The
stringbeans made a compromise, however.  If he and his friends viewed
one bad fanfic a day they would not torture and kill all of them.  The
stringbeans have set up a movie theater inside the dwelling of the six
unfortunate souls.  Only fanfics can be viewed in this theater,
however.  A certain time every day they will all be forced into the
theater to view the fic of the day.  Resistance to comply will result in
immediate death.  So begins the MST.

The group sits in their living room, as usual. They are watching "Blues
Clues" on TV.
STEVE: Why the fuck are we watching this crap?
SHARRIN: Beats the shit outta me. Who turned this on?
No one answers.
CROW: Whatever, man.
JOHNNY: It's days like these that I wish they would just send us the fic
already, so it will give us something to do.
NASTICA: I hear ya.
They all sit there, silent for a moment.
TILL: Come on, you bastards! Send us the Goddamn fic already!
There is nothing but silence. Suddenly there is a knock at the door.
TILL: (getting up) Finally.
Till goes over to the door and opens it. The stringbean stands there,
gazing up at Till.
STRINGBEAN: Greetings. Your fan fic today is "The Erotic Torture Chamber
Part 8".
TILL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, we already watched that fucking thing.
STRINGBEAN: Yes, but this time I'm sending you a film of you MSTing the
fic with someone MSTing your MST.
TILL: (Scratches his head) So...we're MSting and MST of our MST?
STRINGBEAN: Correct.
TILL: Alright.
Till and walks back into the living room.
TILL: We're MSting and MST of our MST.
Till heads towatrds the theater.
STEVE: Huh?
TILL: You'll see, just come on.
Everyone follows Till into the theater.

the new commentary is written like (<this>)

I don't own any of the Tenchi charcters, or Till, Steve,Sharrin,
Nastica,
Johny,Stringbean or Crow (these were created by the author of the MST i
am
MSTing)
I have nothing against the writers of this overveiw, and I DEFINATLY
have
nothing against the author of erotic torture chamber!
The first overveiw's comments are written in <these> (apart from the
begining) and my comments are in ~*these*~

Till, Steve, Sharrin, and Nastica are moshing

~*moshing?*~

(<SHARRIN: Yeah, M-O-S-H-I-N-G, moshing. What part of that word did you
NOT understand?>)

in the living room to the sound of Slipknot's "Iowa" album blasting from
the stereo.  Johnny and Crow come downstairs and gaze on at the fray

~*Does that make sence to
you?*~.

(<TILL: If you're not stupid it does.>)

With a quick glance at
each other they dive into the middle of the living room and into the
mini pit.

~*HUH?*~

(<NASTICA: It's not that fucking complicated.>)
(<STEVE: Maybe this person was just kept in the dark about heavy metal
concerts.>)
(<TILL: (immitating truck driver from Cowboy BeBop) Seems that way.>)

CROW: Death from above!

~*HUH?x2*~

(<STEVE: DUMBASS!x3.>)

Ten minutes later everyone sits on the couch with the music off and with
very tired expressions on their faces.

~*Tired? What have they done?*~

(<TILL: WE WERE MOSHING! GROW A BRAIN STEM, FOR FUCK'S SAKE!>)

SHARRIN: Whoa, what a rush.

~*Yeh, you must have typed that so quickly you
didn't notice that it didn't make sense!*~

(<NASTICA: Okay...listen to me very very carefully...WE WERE MOSHING IN
THE LIVING ROOM! JUMPING AROUND AND SLAMMING INTO EACHOTHER IS VERY
TIRESOME, ASSHOLE! SO SHUT YOUR STUPID FUCKING MOUTH  UNTIL YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT! MY GOD, I HATE STUPID PEOPLE!>)

There is a knock at the door.
TILL: Who the shit could that be?
Till gets up and walks over to the door. He opens it and sees one of the
Satanic Stringbeans

~*What the hell?*~

(<STEVE: Exactly what it says; Satanic Stringbeans. Read the fucking
prolgue next time.>)

standing there.
TILL: ...Goddammit.

~*It's a stringbean! I ordered cabbage!*~

(<CROW: That was kinda funny.>)
(<STEVE: Yeah, I'll give the person that.>)

STRINGBEAN: I take it you have guessed ehy I have stopped by.
TILL: Yeah, we're going, we're going.
STRINGBEAN: It's called "Erotic Torture Chamber Chapter 8" by the way.
TILL: (cringes) Ugh, that sounds bad.

~*You obviously thought it was good
enough to read though!*~

(<STEVE: Wrong. I picked the ones that sound bad so I can MST them.>)

Till walks back out into the living room.

~*Lost me too*~

(<TILL: It's not that far to the living room, how could you get lost?
What a stupid piece of shit.>)

TILL: Okay everyone, fic time.
ALL: (groans)
They all get up and head towards the theater.

~*Theater? To read a fanfic?*~

(<NASTICA: That's how most MSTs I've encountered have been approached;
by viewing them in a theater. You don't know how MSTs even work, do
you?>)

(6:32, Washu and Sasami's room.)

<TILL: Wow, the author doesn't even bother to give a title or a
disclaimer

~*Why? no-one reads them!*~

(<NASTICA: True, ture...>)

 to the story, he just tosses us right
in there.

~*Because it's so famous, and people usually don't read part 8
withought reading part 1,2,3,4,5,6,7or8 first*~>

(<JOHNNY: Oh, I thought you just said that no one reads them.>)
(<STEVE: And what the hell is that? "people usually don't read part 8
without (you spelled 'without' wrong, dumbass) reading part
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8"? How can you read part eight without reading part
eight? That's what it says! Fucking idiot...>)

"Mihoshi......."
"Mihoshi, are you awake?", Kiyone whispered across the bed to Mihoshi,
who
lay awake also.

<SHARRIN: (as Mihoshi) No, now shut up.>

"Yes Kiyone, I am awake" she whispered back.

<JOHNNY: (as Mihoshi) So what the fuck do you want?!

~*What, in her condition?*~>

(<STEVE: Whatever...>)

"We got to find a way to get out of here dammit!" Kiyone whispered to
her in
her yelling whisper voice.

"You t~*w*~o aren't going anywhere, hehehehehehe", said Sasami.

~*Didn't you
guys pick up on that mistake?*~

(<JOHNNY: Yes, we just didn't care. You didn't pick up on how you
spelled "without" W-I-T-H-O-U-G-H-T?>)

<STEVE: What? Where the hell did Sasami come from?

~*The door maybe?*~>

(<TILL: Maybe, but it didn't say, so there's no way of knowing, so shut
your hole.>)

Sasami grabbed Kiyone's waist and pulled her close to her.  She began to

rub
Kiyone's pussy.

<CROW: Wow, we're just thrown violently into this story here.

~*Not really. Your expected to read the others first.*~>

<NASTICA: Yeah, I mean right off the bat Sasami is dykin' it out with
Kiyone.

~*Not really, she has been in about the last seven episodes!*~>

(<SHARRIN: Good for her! Do you want a cookie now?! You obviously didn't
read the prologue to our MST, so shut your mouth! If you had you
would've known what the satanic stringbeans were doing in the story!>)

Kiyone and Mihoshi have

~*Had really. Missed that one didn't you!*~

(<STEVE: Well, the way that it is stated, the situation could be
referred to in the past or present tense, so technically speaking, I
didn't give a rat's ass.>)

learned
by now that they cannot
fight against Washu and Sasami, no matter how much police training
they've
had.

<JOHNNY: Washu had police training?>

~*No dumbo! KIYONE AND MIHOSHI have learned...blah...blah...blah.....*~

(<SHARRIN: Oh, they learned blah, blah, blah, that's much clearer now.>)

(<STEVE: I think I remember them being galaxy police or someting, but I
haven't seen the TV show in a while, so I'm not completely sure.>)

<CROW: I, I guess.

~*Hve you got a stutter?*~>

(<CROW: Do you have a monkey stuck up your ass?! I'll talk however I
please! I noticed that you spelled 'have' incorrectly, but I won't
criticize you on stuff like that until you start acting stupid again.>)

Sasami began to kiss Kiyone.  Cum stains were all over the bed.

<NASTICA: Just thought you'd like to know that there were cum stains on
the bed.>

Mihoshi was still silent, she was too afraid to speak a word.

<NASTICA: (as Mihoshi) ...boogers

~*What kind of word is that?*~.

(<TILL: It's the shit that comes out of your nose, come on, pull the
shit out of your brain and get with it.>)

I spoke a word!>

~*Very clever*~

"Can me and Mihoshi at least have a shower?" asked Kiyone.

"What's a matter, you don't like me and Washu's dried cum all over
you?"

<ALL: NO WE DON'T!!>

"NO I DON"T YOU SICK FUCK!!!!!!" yelled Kiyone.

<CROW: Hey, no fair, she copied us!>

~*Oh God*~

(<JOHNNY: Yeah. Oh God, they killed Kenny.>)

>SMACK!!!!!<

"DON'T YOU EVER TALK TO ME LIKE THAT AGAIN YOU GOOD FOR NOTHING TRAMP!

<JOHNNY: Yeah, I'm so sure

~*So sure?*~

(<JOHNNY: What the hell was that supposed to mean?>)

she's the tramp here.>

Just
for that, you have to drink my cum..."

<CROW: Oh my God!>

~*God strikes you down*~

(<CROW: Yeah, well Satan rises from the depths of hell and impales your
head on a pitch fork.>)

<STEVE: The author seems to have gotten rid of the plot before the story
even started.>
<TILL: Y'know, I don't think Washu and Sasami ever owned a torture
chamber and acted so vile towards their friends.>

~*Its, original and, a fanfic?*~

<JOHNNY: Remember, this is a lemon, it doesn't make sense in the least.

~*Don't read them then!*~>

(<STEVE: If we're going to MST it we have to read the thing.>)

<TILL: Oh, gotcha.>

"Please no! anything but that!" begged Kiyone.

<SHARRIN: (as Sasami) ANYTHING but my cum? You shouldn't have said
that.>
<TILL: (to Sharrin) You're referring to something similar to the porno
that Slipknot watched on their secret song, aren't you?>

~*You like Slipknot don't you?*~

(<STEVE: No shit. Your powers of observation astonish me. Not really,
but whatever.>)

<SHARRIN: He he he...>
<STEVE: Oh God...>

"Well you do want a bath don't you?"

Kiyone nodded slightly......

"okay, you can have a cum bath, hehehehehehehehehehehe!"

<CROW: Oh, why did I have to eat all that pizza before I watched

~*Oh I get it! Your pretending you have a machine that puts story on the
telly! Wow! And I bet TinkyWinky built it too!*~

(<CROW: The bloody hell was that all about?>)
(<NASTICA: The person's saying that a gay purple alien built our viewing
screen.>)
(<CROW: Oh...okay.>)

this fic?>

Washu has set up this system where all the prisoner's in her chamber
have
to
put there private's in, or on this machine.  The machine suck's you dry
of
all the cum you have and tranfer's it to a large tub......The tub has
been
collecting for a long time and is completely full.

<ALL:EEEEEEEEEEWWWW!!>
<TILL: A tub full of really old, rank cum really is not a nice image.>

~*Agreed*~

(<STEVE: Thank you.>)

"come on Kiyone, you might find it to be quite relaxing."

<SHARRIN: Y'know, I've done some really bad tortures to people, but this

seems to go past anything I have done. And the people I did it to
deserved it, what the hell did these two do to deserve this?

~*They were charactors in an incest?*~>

(<NASTICA: I guess we should be glad that we were never sent the other
seven parts.>)

<JOHNNY: (to Sharrin) I'm with you on this, Sharrin.>

~*I'm not*~

(<JOHNNY: Well, whopee for you.>)

Sasami forced KIyone to the room where the tub was....

"This should be a riot!" she said.

<STEVE: (to everyone else) You know how deeply disturbed I am,

~*All:YES*~

(<STEVE: Damn straight.>)

I'm probably gonna find this to be a riot as well. I laughed my ass off
at the La Blue Girl videos, I'll probably find this quite amusing too.

~*FIRST HAPPY COMMENT YOU'VE MADE!*~>

(<STEVE: Hey, it is.>)

<NASTICA: (smacks Steve in the back of the head) You twisted bastard!>

~*Yeh*~

<STEVE: (to Nastica) What?>

~*You went mad, thats what!*~

(<STEVE: You're Goddamn right I did!>)

She then forced Kiyone into the thick warm batch of cum.

<STEVE: Oooookay, I just changed my mind, that description was uncalled
for.

~*So was this mst.*~>

(<STEVE: Bite my ass.>)

(Ayeka's Room)

"I am sooooo damn horney.....ther'e no Sasami around anymore...she
keep's
avoiding me and seeks refudge in Washu's lab.

<TILL: I never knew that everyone in Tenchi's household were sex starved
psychopaths who tortured one another.

~*You still havn't grasped the idea of fan !FICTION! have you?*~>

(<TILL: I don't care! It's the principle of the fucking matter! The line
should be drawn somewhere!>)

<STEVE: They're not, but this author seems to think they are.>

That damn bitch Washu!

<SHARRIN: (as Ayeka) She stole my Eggo waffle!>

~*(as me) you wrote a crappy mst!*~

(<STEVE: So did you, so shove it up your ass.>)

Tenchi
would never have sex with me if I asked him....Maybe I should rape him
as I
do Sasami....

<CROW: Yeah, or you could NOT.>

~*Yeh, killing you would be much more satisfying*~

(<NASTICA: Is that person referring to us?>)
(<JOHNNY: I'd like to see the fucker try.>)

That would never work because he'd tell that space
whore!!!!Unless........"

Ayeka realized the horse tranquilizer's she had in her droor.

<TILL: "Droor"? Anyone got a dictionary on them?>

~*No dictionary? is that why your mst is so terribly written!*~

(<STEVE: You forgot to capitalize the 'I' in is at the beginning of the
sentence and there should be a question mark at the end of the second
sentence instead of a period. Our MST is poorly written? Ha!>)

<CROW: I think the author's just making up words. They do that
sometimes.>
<SHARRIN: Does Ayeka have a lot of uses for horse tranquilizers, is that
why she has them? Y'know, seeing as how they DON'T HAVE A HORSE!>

~*It's called protection!

(<SHARRIN: I don't know anyone who uses horse tranquilizers for
protection.>)
(<TILL: I prefer a 9mm semi-automatic, or a twelve gauge double-barelled
Remmington.>)
(<JOHNNY: I use-->)
(<NASTICA: (cuts Johnny off) I'd feel better not knowing.>)
(<JOHNNY: (to Nastica) All right.>)

Which you are going to nead when i've finished writting
about your crap MST*~>

(<JOHNNY: (sarcastic) Oh no, I'm scared!>)
(<STEVE: Come into my house, I'll show you what I use for fucking
protection.>)

"If I only gave him a small dose of it, it won't be enough to kill him
but
it will knock him out long enough to let me do what I need to do....."

<NASTICA: (as Ayeka) Ummm...what was I saying?>

Ayeka opened her droor,

<CROW: There it is again!>
<JOHNNY: What IS that?!

~*Its DRAWER if you had the brains to work it out.

(<CROW: No shit, we were just being assholes, didn't YOU have the brains
to work THAT out? You really don't know how MSTs work, I'm positive of
that now.>)

Anyone can make an honest mistake, but you must have had alot of
practise to make such good ones ALL THE TIME!*~

(<STEVE: Which mistakes are these that we are making all the time?
Please; enlighten us.>)
(<NASTICA: And no, that wasn't an honest mistake, it was done TWICE.
It's not that hard to spell 'drawer'.>)

revealing the horse tranquilizer's.  She then
smiled
devilishly and thought up a plan......

(back at the tub...)

<TILL: Oh no.>

~*Oh Yes, mwahahahahahahaha!*~

Kiyone realized that Sasami had left the door open when she left.

<SHARRIN: A retarded jelly fish could have realized that the door was
open, what the hell's your point?

~*Whats the point of this MST*~>

(<STEVE: There is no point, there is no point to ANYTHING if you think
about it. It's just-->)
(<SHARRIN: (cuts Steve off) Don't give your speech on the ponitlessness
of existence right now, it takes too long.>)
(<STEVE: (to Sharrin) Okay. And besides, what's the point of yours?>)

>If only there was a way I could escape.< she thought.

<CROW: Try going through the open door, butt-for-brains.>

~*Hello?

(<CROW: Hi.>)

Theres two cycopaths in the room,

(<JOHNNY: "Psychopaths" is spelled COMPLETELY wrong...>)

both of which are godess' and one who is a genious,
theres a bit more to it than walking out of the door!*~>

(<STEVE: You fucked up on 'Goddesses'. See, these things are a lot more
noticable than the petty mistakes that you point out. There's also two
apostrophies missing from your sentences.>)

She creeped slowly out of the bath and proceeded out

~*Of? Didn't you guy's get that?*~

(<TILL: What's to get? She crept out of the bath. What's your point?
You're the one to talk after spelling psychopaths C-Y-C-O-P-A-T-H-S,
dipshit!>)

the door. She
peeked
her
head out both way's to see if sasami was waiting there to suprise her.

<JOHNNY: And if she was there to suprise her she'd be caught anyways by
revealing herself.>

~*What*~

(<JOHNNY: EXACTLY WHAT I FUCKING SAID! GOOD GOD, YOU'RE DENSE!>)

To
her luck, no one was there.  She crept down the dark hallway.
            Little did she know that this was Washu and Sasami's plan;
her
movement's were constantly being watched by over7,000 camera's.

<STEVE: Wow, Washu must have a massive budget to be able to have 7000
cameras and 7000 monitors to watch them on.

~*She is a genious*~>

(<CROW: Just because she's a genious doesn't mean that she's rich.>)

<CROW: I seriously doubt that over 7000 cameras are needed to monitor
ONE hallway.

~*no. the whole complex*~>

(<NASTICA: Well, that should've been verified, then.>)

>This is easier then I thought < Thought Kiyone.

She proceeded down the hallway, looking in prison cells along the way.
She
had at first tried to rescue prisoner's with her expert galaxy police
lock
openinig training, but the lock's were far too advanced.

<JOHNNY: No they weren't, shut the hell up.>

~*Geez. You don't like it when you don't get you're own way, do you?*~

(<JOHNNY: No, I'm just very violent and impatient by nature.>)

                She looked in one of the room's and found an atractive
woman
chained down

<SHARRIN: Is Kiyone bi now? Or did she just happen to randomly think to
herself that the woman chained down was attractive?

~*Ever heard of, Authors decription*~>

(<TILL: Ever heard of "question marks"? Well, you forgot one!>)

with tears in her eye's. She tried to plea for Kiyone to
rescue
her through the ballgag.  Kiyone made eye contact with the woman.

"I'm sorry!   I'm soooo sorry. Th....there's nothing I can do!"
Kiyone said, crying as she said it.

The woman released some more tear's as her hope's were let down.  All of

the
sudden,

<STEVE: Yes, all of "the" sudden...>

~*You died!*~>

(<STEVE: (sarcastic) Oh, good one.>)

Tentecles shot out from the wall's in the womans cell and began
molesting her, insurting tentecles in every hole...

<TILL: Good GOD!

~*He's not a dog!*~>

(<ALL: What the fuck?>)
(<SHARRIN: Who's not a dog? What the hell are you talking about?>)

<STEVE: It's a staple in hentai. Tentacle rape.>

~*You've realised it's hentai? WELL DONE!*~

(<STEVE: I knew it was a hentai since the second I saw the title, what
are you trying to prove?>)

<NASTICA: And in the first Evil Dead.>

~*Huh?*~

(<NASTICA: THE FIRST "EVIL DEAD"! DO I NEED TO SPEAK INTO A MEGAPHONE?!
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! ARE YOU DEAF OR JUST A GODDAMN RETARD?!!>)

<STEVE: Yup, that too. But y'know, the Tenchi Muyo characters were never
meant for hentai

~*Then why look at a Tenchi lemon section?*~

(<SHARRIN: Because those are the best ones to MST.>)

, so I think that hentai should just be left to original characters
designed for that such purpose.

~*Are there any like that?*~>

(<TILL: Quite a few, actually. Haven't seen a lot of hentai I can't name
many off th etop of my head, but Miko Mido would be one.>)

<SHARRIN: (to Steve) I'm gonna go with you on that one.>

~*I'm not*~

The woman gave Kiyone a
desperate look; but there was nothing Kiyone could do but wall away.

<CROW: "Wall" away?>

(Sasami and Washu's room)

"All this excitment is making me horney Washu." Said Sasami.

<CROW: (as Washu) Okay, good for you. Do you want a cookie or
something?>

"Should we fuck Mihoshi?" Said Washu.

"I want you Washu.." Said Sasami.

The two began to kiss passionatley.

<JOHNNY: This is almost as random as Happy Noodle Boy.>

~*Stop referring to stuff we've never heard of!*~

(<JOHNNY: NO! You stop being a dumbass, then we'll talk!>)

Washu lay back while Sasami lay on top
of her, nibbling on her ear lobe.  Sasami began to kiss Washu's neck.
Washu
moved her hand on Sasami's ass and began massaging it.

"I wish my ass was as firm as yours Sasami" Said Washu.

<STEVE: I wish my firm foot was planted up her firm ass.>

~*Ewww, messy!*~

(<SHARRIN: It could be much messier, trust me.>)

"I wish my pussy was as fine as yours Washu."

<SHARRIN: There, you're both even, now shut up!>

Sasami moved down to Washu's Pussy. She began to suck on it Furiously.

<NASTICA: The new Dirt Devil Sasami.>
<STEVE: (to Nastica) This kinda reminds me of the time I saw you and
Sharrin goin' at it in the living room.>
<SHARRIN: (to Steve) Hey we were drunk! And we never got THAT far!

~*GOD you lot are weird!*~>

(<NASTICA: Yeah, "we lot are weird", nice sentence structure, asshole.>)

<STEVE: Heh heh heh.

~*Yeh laugh it off!*~>

(<STEVE: Thank you, I will.>)

"Oh Sasami!"

She insurted her long tounge inside Washu's cunt.

<CROW: Were they pre-naked or something?>

~*Have you even been reading? sorry. WATCHING.*~

Washu Put her foot on
Sasami's head as she sucked.  She would push Sasami's head into her
pussy
with her foot.

<TILL: Does Washu have a vagina the size of a broom closet or
something?>

~*Do you even understans how vagina's work? Actually, are you a
girl or a boy?*~

(<STEVE: Hmmm...how many girls do you know named 'STEVE'?>)
(<TILL: "understand" is spelled wrong, "vaginas" is used as a posessive
rather than a plural noun...>)

She wrapped her leg's around Sasami's head, and grabbed
a
lock of her hair.

"Oh God Sasami!"

<JOHNNY: (as Washu) You have lice!>

"UH!"

Sasami made circular motions with her tounge.  Washu squeezed Sasami's
head
tightly with her thighs.

"OOOOHHHHHH SASAMI!!!!! OHHHHHH SHIT!!! OH SHIT!!!!!OH FUCK! UH, UH, UH,

UH,
UH, OH YES!!!! SUCK ME UP BABY OOOHHHHHHHHH!"

<CROW: Ah, such intellectual dialogue.

~*Bet you went through 5 dictionaries and read Romeo and Julliet to get
that one.*~>

(<NASTICA: What the hell was that about?>)
(<STEVE: I have read Romeo and Juliet, but I fail to see the MSTers
point.>)
(<SHARRIN: There is no point. No relevant one, anyways.>)

Washu put both hands on Sasami's head and forced Sasami's head deep into

her
pussy.

<STEVE: Anyone want to explain the physics of that to the author?>

~*No*~

<TILL: Well, first of all Sasami would be suffocating.>

*Get a girl-freind and begin to understand.*~

(<STEVE: Hey, I'm trying, alright! And besides, I wouldn't want a woman
with a pussy that damn loose! The thought of it is just really
unsettling.>)
(<TILL: I don't know what kind of girls this person has met, but none
that I know have vaginas that large.>)

<CROW: Second of all her head wouldn't have fit in there in the first
place.>

~*Sigh*~

(<SHARRIN: Okay, fine, maybe there are some women in the world with a
vagina that large, but I like to assure myself that there aren't.>)

<SHARRIN: Third, there's-->
<STEVE: (cuts Sharrin off) Okay, it'll take way too long to explain,
let's just quit now.>

~*Phew*~

 Lifted her torso up and began making circle motions with Sasami's
head moving with it.  Washu's eye's rolled in the back of her head
making
her eyes completely white...

<STEVE: She's Scorpion!>
<TILL: (immitating Scorpion) Get over here!>

~*Not again with the stuff we don't understand.....*~

(<STEVE: Don't speak for everyone. Not everyone hasn't heard of Mortal
Kombat. It doesn't take a genious to know a famous line from a famous
video game.>)

chils began to form all over Washu's body as
she
was about to have the orgasm of her life!  Sasami maoned

~*Not notice the mistake?*~

(<TILL: I've said it before, and I'll say it again...WE DIDN'T CARE! It
wasn't that significant! We're only pointing out your insignificant
mistakes just to shut your mouth!>)

as she sucked.

<JOHNNY: Just as we're moaning as this fanfic SUCKS!>

Sasami put both hands on Washu's ass cheeks, squeezing and massaging
them
as
she sucked .

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<TILL: Car alarms are going off within a two mile radius...>

~*I'm butchering you with a knife*~

(<STEVE: I'm ripping your stomach open and strangling you with your own
intestines before pissing on you and dismembering your body with a rusty
axe...>)

!!"Washu screemed like a mad demon getting it's leg's ripped off.

<NASTICA: What does a mad demon getting its legs ripped sound like
exactly?

~*The sound when we meet.*~>

(<STEVE: So, when I meet this person the sound of a demon getting its
legs ripped off is going to cut through the air?>)
(<CROW: I guess.>)

<STEVE: Sounds kinda like BREEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHH!!>

>SPLURRRGGLLEEE!!!!!!!<

<CROW: Wow, the guy who says "SURGE" must've been really drunk.>

Washu cummed all over Sasami's face. She sent a jet stream, almost like
a
water cannon of cum flying everywhere.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!FFFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKK!!!!!!!!"

<CROW: (cleaning out ears with cotton swabs) I really wish this theater
didn't have digital sound at times like this.

~*Again with TinkiWinkies invention?*~>

(<JOHNNY: That's it, after we're done here I'm going out and killing
TinkiWinki.>)

Washu continued to screem as she continued to blast cum all over the
place:
on the ceilling, on all the walls, completely saturating the bed
blankets so
soaked, that the cum leaked all the way down through the sheet's to the
matress, Not to mention all over Sasami; who was head to toe covered in
cum.

<NASTICA: My GOD, I've never seem so much bodily fluid in my LIFE!>
<STEVE: Sasami must've ruptured a valve or something.>

"AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!" Sasami laughed histerically as cum continued

flying everywhere.

<TILL: IT'S STILL GOING?!?!?>

Cum shot in her mouth as she laughed witch made her
choke:

<ALL: CHOKE! CHOKE! CHOOOOOOOOOKE!!!

~*I'm killing you*~>

(<TILL: Man, what a moron.>)

"COUGH< CHOKE HAHAHA< CHOKE GAG!!!<HAHAHA!" Sasami couldn't stop
laughing.

The flow of the cum was now slowing down a bit .

<CROW: Which should've already stopped by now...>

Washu grabbed Sasami's
ass
and grinded her cunt against it, making more cum squish against Sasami's

ass.

<JOHNNY: Someone definately needs to send a plumber in to fix Washu's
leak there; that's just not right.>

~*While there at it, they can stem the flow of blood coming from your
head.*~

(<JOHNNY: Was that supposed to be a threat?>)
(<STEVE: I dunno. It was quite vague.>)

"Hehehehe! Washu! Hehehehe! What are you Hehehehe doing? Hahahaha."
Sasami
laughed as she was being moved up and down against Washu's pussy.

Washu began to smile.

<STEVE: She's been laughing the whole time, but just now began smiling,
okay.>

"Washu, that was sooo fucking hilarious!!!!!!Hahahahaha!"

<JOHNNY: Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha, DIE!>

Washu started to laugh too. She rolled ontop of Sasami and began to kiss

her.

>Kiss< "That was pretty >kiss<

<JOHNNY: Fucking >stab< nasty >maim< wasn't it?>

~*(me), yeh*~

funny >kiss< wasn't it?" Said Washu as
she
kissed her cum soaked body.

Washu put Sasami's right breast in her mouth.

<TILL: What about the left one? Don't leave me in suspense!>

"MMMM Sasami, i'm gonna suck all that cum off of you.."

<CROW: By sucking on her breast?>
<STEVE: There have already been several impossible acts performed in
this fic, why not one more?>

"UH!" Sasami let out a moan of pleasure.
Washu started twisting the other nipple while still sucking on the first

one.

"UH! " Moaned Sasami, "I wonder  >UH!<  How  >UH!< KIyone is
doing.....oh!!!!"

"I'll check" Said Washu.

<NASTICA: (laughs) Yeah, okay, just abandon what you're doing...>
<STEVE: I guess it's kinda good that she did.>
<NASTICA: I know, but it's just the principle of the thing...>

**********************************

KIyone begun to get frusterated.  She had been walking through endless
hall's
for hours.  She had become used to being naked.

<STEVE: Just thought you'd like to know, anyways...>

She continued walking
untill
she found a flight of stairs.....

<CROW: (singing) And she's finding the stairway to...heaven.>

~*Were the HELL did that come from?*~

(<NASTICA: From a Led Zepplin song! Please tell me you know who THEY
are! Don't tell me that you're THAT socially deprived.>)

>Well, I might as well walk up them, they might lead me out of this shit

hole!< Thought Kiyone.

She procceded up the stairs lit by torches until she came to a giant
door
with a demonic symbol on it...

<STEVE: Uh oh, she just wandered into "Doom".>

>Could this be?< She thought, >Is this the exit? am I free now<

<JOHNNY: Demonic symbols on doors usually don't mean a good thing.

~*Have you read the other part's? MAYBE saw saw it when she came in?*~>

(<JOHNNY: Well, I'm sorry, it's just that nothing good usually comes
from satanic things. And YOU DIDN'T READ OUR MST's PROLOGUE, SO WHY
SHOULD WE READ THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS STORY?!>)

She excitidly turned the knob and pushed open the heavy door and was
happy
to
find that she was in Washu's lab...

"Yes!!!! I'm outta here! All I have to do is walk out Washu's lab and
tell
the other's."

<CROW: (as Kiyone) Oh, wait, everyone else is sick and perverted too...>

~*What? Ryo-ohki, the perverted cabbit? Nobaluki's a pervert, but not
sick,
Yosho's not, Ryouko and Tenchi are enjoying mad sex very much but...oh
wait!

(<ALL: IT WAS A JOKE! SHUT UP!>)

You don't understand without Dipsy here to translate.*~

(<JOHNNY: I'm gonna have to kill Dipsy too.>)
(<STEVE: Which one is that? The Yellow one? The green one?>)
(<JOHNNY: Ah, screw it, I'll kill them all.>)

Kiyone ran through the lab, making her way happily to the
door
exiting Washu's laboratory and SWOOSSH!

<STEVE: It's Batman!>

The door flung open and Kiyone ran
through the house not knowing what to do first.  She decided it be best
if
she through some clothes on....

<NASTICA: That's the wrong form of the word "through" there. It should
be "threw".>
<TILL: Thank you for that information, Nastica, you have made my day a
little bit brighter.>
<NASTICA: (to Till) Shut your hole.

~*Ditto*~>

(Tenchi's room )

"OH TENCHI!!!! OH TENCHI!!!! OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH TENCHI!!! YES! YES! YES!"

<SHARRIN: No, no, no.>

screemed Ryouko as she continued getting fucked in the pussy doggy
style.

> SLAP<    >SLAP<   >SLAP<

<SHARRIN: ...were the sounds made by my hand smacking them in the
face...

~*Sure? Thought it was me hitting you...*~>

(<SHARRIN: No, I'm pretty sure it wasn't.>)

Were the sounds of tenchi's lap smacking Ryouko's ass with every hump.

"OOOOOhhhhhh Ryouko!"

>SLAM!<

<CROW: Ooooh! That one didn't sound healthy.

~*I've got out my Sledgehammer*~>

(<JOHNNY: My sledgehammer can kick your sledgehammer's ass.>)

The door flung open and Kiyone begun to explain what happened, not
giving a
rats ass whether Tenchi and Ryouko were fucking.  Tenchi pulled his
swollen
dick

<STEVE: Damn, he must have an allergic reaction to Ryoko's cooch.>

out of Ryouko's pink pussy and the two of them imediatly hid under
the
cover's.

<STEVE: Yeah, hiding under the covers is going to make Kiyone oblivious
to what they were just doing. Suuuuure...>

"Kiyone what the HELL are you doing!!!!!!!" Screemed tenchi and Ryouko
in
unisong.

<CROW: They sang it?>

"GUY'S I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT!!!!!!" Screemed
Kiyone.

"What is it!?" yelled Tenchi, extremely embaressed of being caught
fucking
Ryouko.

<NASTICA: What's to be embarassed about? Does he not want people to know
that he's straight?>

"YOU KNOW THAT PROJECT WASHU'S BEEN WORKING ON?"

<CROW: (as Tenchi) Okay, we're five feet away from you, you don't have
to scream.>

Tenchi and Ryouko nodded.

"It's really a sex dungeon! And she's been holding Me and Mihoshi
captive in
there and performing EVIL sexual torchers on us!!!!!!" Said an out of
breath
Kiyone.

"I new it!"

<CROW: I brand new it!>
<SHARRIN: (to Crow) Oh, shut up.

~*Couldn't have put it better myself.*~>

said Ryouko. "She mentioned something about it to me about
2
years ago, but i didn't asume she was serious.  We were both drunk and
all."

<TILL: Just how I would like to be so I never remember any of this
fanfic.

~*Have an overdose of your medication. anti-insanity can be lethal
(Especially if you don't get your dose.)*~>

(<SHARRIN: 'Anti-insanity' can be lethal? Does that mean that it's
dangerous to not be insane?>)
(<CROW: I guess I'm screwed, then.>)
(<SHARRIN: I guess Johnny, Steve, and I will be fine.>)

"Well, wev'e got to do something" said Tenchi.

"Should I tell the other's?!" asked an irritated Kiyone.

"No, we can take her on are own!" said a determined Tenchi.

"Well then there's something else I have to mention...."

<NASTICA: (as Kiyone) We're out of toilet paper.>

Kiyone told them about Sasami, and all the evil thing's she and Washu
had
done to them.......

***********************

"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! THOSE FOOL!!!!

<SHARRIN: Excuse me, you mean "that" fool.>

~*No. Thoose fools*~

(<STEVE: The way it was written suggested otherwise.>)

Kiyone is leading them into a
trap!
Once Kiyone tell's them about what we've done, they'll come over and
try to
save the day!!!!!!" Said a wicked Washu.

"And once they've come here to investigate, they'll be all our's
Hahahahahahaha!!!!"

<CROW: END!>

Sasami and Washu kissed passionatley at their success.

(5 Hours Later)

<JOHNNY: A cyber demon comes out from the door with the demonic symbol
on it and kills everyone, the end.

~*Does that include you?*~>

(<STEVE: Yes.>)

"ya know, you guy's are truley pathetic." Said Washu as she looked at
the 4
tied up, naked bodies of Kiyone, Mihoshi, Tenchi, and even
Ryouko(although a
fight was needed for her).

<STEVE: What, FOUR of them couldn't take on Washu and a little
eight-year-old Sasami?

~*Have you read this? it's her grown-up form, DUH!*~>

While Washu was telling them all about how stupid they were,

<TILL: Kiyone was telling Washu and Sasami how sick THEY were.>

Sasami was
squeezing Tenchi's dick very hard,

<JOHNNY: SQUISH!>

laughing at Tenchi's struggle.

"Your not ganna get away with this." Said Ryouko.

>SMACK<

"Don't you ever speak to me like that again you stupid bitch!" Fired
Washu.

<STEVE: Good, Washu's been fired, can we go now?>

"In here, you will at all times refer to me as Master Washu!  And if you

don't, you will be punished. Isn't that right Mihoshi?"

"Yes master

<STEVE: Bater.>

Washu." Mihoshi said imediatly.

"You see, we knew that by letting Kiyone go , she would tell the
other's.
Then when that happened we'd have you right where wqe

<SHARRIN: What's "wqe" mean?>
<NASTICA: It means "This fanfic is too damn long.>

want you.....In our
domain! Hehehehehehehe!" Said Sasami.

Washu smiled at Sasami's enthusiasm. Washu walked over and passionatly
kissed
Tenchi, moaning as she did so.

"Oh does that make you Jealous Ryouko?" Said Sasami

Ryouko glared at Sasami.

<JOHNNY: THAT SENTENCE SUCKED! DO IT OVER, YOU PRICK!

~*Prick?*~>

(<JOHNNY: Yeah, you heard me. What's the problem? Is your vocabulary too
small? Is the noun form of the word "prick" unknown to you? Are you that
stupid?>)

"Well if your gonna be a bitch about it, then ....."

Sasami walked over to Tenchi and begun sucking on his dick, while Washu
kissed him madly.

<CROW: (as Washu) I'm insaaaaaaaaaane!>

~*Me (as CROW) So are yooooouuuuuu!*~

(<STEVE: No shit, that's why my nickname is 'Psychosteve', you don't
need to bring it up all the time.>)

"MMMM Ryouko, ya know he really tastes great!" said Sasami with a
chuckle in
her voice.

<SHARRIN: (as Sasami) Yeah, just pick up a knife and fork and dig in...>

Ryouko tried as hard as she could to break the machine with bound her.
But
Washu's technolodgy was far too advanced.
            Sasami stood up so that Tenchi's was face to face with her
pussy.

<STEVE: Tenchi's what?>

 Sasami begun the bang herself only a couple of inches from Tenchi's
nose.

"Oh yeah Babey!!!!"

<NASTICA: Oh, for God's sake, he spelled "baby" wrong. That's not a
typo, that's just plain STUPID!>

moaned Sasami as she continued banging herself, her
hand
touching Tenchi's cheeck every once in  while from movement.

<CROW: Wow, from movement? I never would've guessed.>

  Tenchi
squinted
his eye's shut so he wouldn't have to look at Sasami's cunt .

<STEVE: He felt very differently about her cunt in "At the Carrot
Patch"...>
<TILL: (cringes) Uggghhh...

~*-----*~>

(<TILL: Okay, what the shit do those represent?>)

Every
time he
shut his eyes, Sasami would slap him across the face.

"I'm about to cum now Tenchi.....I hope you like the taste of cum,
Hehehehehehe. Here it comes, get it ? comes, like the word cum?
hehehehe!"

<SHARRIN: I'm going to shove that stupid pun so far up your ass...>

~*It can join my foot in the "stick something up whoever your annoyed at
show"*~

(<JOHNNY: Your incoherent babbling is giving me a migrane.>)
(<STEVE: Uh oh, you used the wrong form of the word "your", it should be
"you're". You did it again a little while back, too.>)

Washu was the only one who laughed at this joke and she smacked the
others
for not laughing at it as well.

<JOHNNY: Okay, I am seriously going to hop into that screen and
mercilessly slaughter those two.>

~*Does that work? Can I try it with you?*~

(<JOHNNY: Go ahead, but I don't think you want to be around me when I'm
doing my work. You might get caught in the middle.>)

Sasami exploded all over his face.

<CROW: Wow, she must've had some C4 inside her.

~*Like the one i've put in you.*~ >

(<SHARRIN: You are so lame...>)
(<JOHNNY: AND CAPITALIZE YOUR GODDAMN 'I' YOU STUPID ASSHOLE!!>)

She
stuck
her finger in side her vagina and pulled out some more.

<TILL: She pulled out more vagina?

~*cum, dung brain!*~>

(<TILL: The grammar structure of the sentence says that there was more
vagina pulled out. You've been correcting grammar this whole time, you
should've noticed.>)
(<CROW: My theory is becoming more sound by the minute; you don't know
how and MST works.>)

<NASTICA: That's what it says.>

She forced the cum
drenched finger into Tenchi's mouth.

"Swallow it bitch!" commanded Sasami.

Tenchi swallowed it with disgust.

"Now theres a good little cock boy! Hehehehehehe!!!!!"

Washu laughed also at this joke.

<STEVE: That was a joke? Oh wait, this entire story is one sad, sad
joke, nevermind.

~*You are sad, sad, sad, but let it go.*~>

(<CROW: We'll let it go if you just accept the fact that you are dumb,
dumb, dumb.>)

"Your funny Sasami" said Washu. "I have an idea," Said Washu.
"Let's beat
the crap out of Ryouko!"

<TILL: No, BOO!

~*Yeh! Leave her alone you bitches*~>

"YAY!" said an excited Sasami. "We should fuck her first though."

******************
(Ayeka's room)

"Gee, I wonder where everybody is..." Said a curious Ayeka.  For once
she
wasn't thinking about rape.

<SHARRIN: For ONCE?

~*You have soooo only read one part*~>

(<SHARRIN: I know she's an incestuous bitch in this story, I'm just
commenting on how fucked up that is.>)

<TILL: Really shows what kind of person she is, doesn't it?.>

"Hello Ayeka!" said Yosho, with a very happy grin on his face. He was
very
fond of her ever since he thought of the possibility of Tenchi becoming
the
Juraiian King if he married her.

"Hello master Yosho, have you seen anyone around here lately? It seem's
odd
that they would all go somewhere without me.."

<CROW: Really? From what I understand they choose to ignore you a lot.>

"I'm sorry Ayeka, I haven't seen anyone except for you and my son for
the
last 10 hours." He replied..

<JOHNNY: Hey, too many FUCKING periods, you jackass!>

"Oh well, maybe they're planning a suprise birthday party or something
for
me!!!!" Said an excited Ayeka.

"But I thought that your birthday wasn't for another 7 months."

<STEVE: I didn't know that Ayeka was a MORON!

~*I did. Same process as with you*~>

(<STEVE: Process? What process? Is there some elaborate process
of...nevermind.>)

Ayeka ignored him.

>Now that I have some time to myself I can plan on how to get Tenchi and

Fuck
him.< she thought to herself.

<SHARRIN: Use the horse tranquilizers you got from that thing called a
"droor" and fuck him while he's passed out; it's not that hard to come
up with that plan.>
<STEVE: But remember; Ayeka seems to be really stupid in this story.

~*She always is. Hey! Are you her twin?*~>

(<JOHNNY: HEY! ARE YOU AN ANNOYING SON OF A BITCH WITH A BIG FUCKING
MOUTH?!>)

<SHARRIN: Oh yeah.>

~*Yes, you are?*~

**************************

Washu and sasami carried Ryouko to an empty dungeon room and went to
work on
her.  Sasami strapped on a 19 inch long fake cock that was 3 inches
thick.

<SHARRIN: Ha! The 20 inch black studded dildo I used to beat the shit
out of a burglar puts that stupid thing to shame!>
<TILL: (to Sharrin) I didn't need to hear that.>
<SHARRIN: (to Till) Well, TOO FREAKIN' BAD!>

She smiled at Ryouko.  "I am gonna show you what pain is all about !"

<CROW: (as Sasami) I'm going to force you to watch a 24 hour
"Teletubbie" marathon!

~*Telitubbies:eh-ooo!*~>

(<CROW: That was an awkward response.>)
(<JOHNNY: Yeah.>)

Washu held Ryouko down and Sasami begun humping Ryouko's pussy.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

<NASTICA: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB...>
<STEVE: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC...>

~*KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL

YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU*~

(<STEVE: I could've sworn that 'D' comes afer 'C', not 'K'. And 'L'
comes after-->)
(<TILL: (to Steve) The person is just being dumb, shut up.>)
(<STEVE: (to Till) I know! I'm just being sarcastic. And "kill" is
spelled incorrectly.>)

AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Ryouko screemed bloody murder ~*BLOODY MURDER!!*~as Sasami went to work
pumping that
enormus
cock inside her.

Sasami Laughed at Ryouko, followed by giggles by Washu.

"GOOOOOOODDDDDD HELP

MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH

HHHHHHHHHHOOOOOHHHHHH GOD! UH!UH!UH!UH!FUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!!!!!"R youko
continued screeming louder then the sound of a jet taking off.

<TILL: Ummm...no? How 'bout not?>

Blood squirted from all sides of her pussy, leaking down her leg and all

over
Sasami.

<CROW: Ick! Is that thing covered in razorblades or something?>

~*Sigh*~

(<JOHNNY: What's the matter? Are you getting tired of being a worthless
piece of shit who doesn't deserve to live?>)

Washu laughed, revealing her sharp teeth.  Sasami continued
ruthlesly humping Ryouko's swollen bloody clit.

<NASTICA: Please don't...describe that...

~*Bloody.........Swollen...*~>

(<JOHNNY: Maggot infested...>)

"That feels good huh?" screemed Sasami back a t Ryouko.
Ryouko kept screeming.

Washu wrapped her legs around Ryouko's face, muffling the sound of the
screems by 50%.

<CROW: I thought it was more like 53%

~*Wanna make a guess on how much of your body i'm gonna mutilate*~.>

(<STEVE: No, let's play a different game. It's called "SHUT THE FUCK
UP!" You go first.>)

washu put both her hands on Ryouko's Head and pressed
inward
toward's her pussy.  Tears were rolling down Ryouko's face.Sasami
slapped
Ryouko's ass every time she pumped that cock inside of her. Washu cummed

on
Ryouko's face.

<JOHNNY: (pointing at screen) This screen is the only thing keeping me
out of there and ripping the guts out of both of you!>

~*Same here! For you lot!*~

(<STEVE: "For you lot"? Are you British, or does your grammar just
blow?>)

"This is fun Washu. I'm making this bitch screem with agony!"

Washu Laughed histerically at Ryouko getting raped.

<SHARRIN: As I would've laughed at Washu's head being flattened by a
Semi.>

~*As I would have laughed if you were on the Itchy and Scratchy
show!*~

(<STEVE: I would too, that's a funny show. They're my kind of people.>)

<STEVE: I have nothing against any of these characters right here, but
dammit, IT'S NOT REALLY THEM! It's so hard for me to remember that. And
each time I forget I want to stab Washu and Sasami in the face!>
<NASTICA: (to Steve) Just calm down, we all feel the same way.>

Sasami pulled of the
strap on dick and let all her cum out on to Ryouko's body.

"Drink it bitch!"

"Yeah Drink it!"

Sasami and Washu grabbed weapons.

<CROW: Why, and from where? Who cares?>
<TILL: Plot? Reason? What are these words you speak?>

"we told you we were gonna beat you after we raped you....

<SHARRIN: (as Ryoko) No you didn't...>

 so here it
comes!!!"

>Smack<!

Washu hit Ryouko over the back with a leather wip.

>Smack<!

She did it again. Sasami took a wooden bat and swung at Ryouko's legs
with
it.
Ryouo did nothing but cry.~*Notice the absence of a K?*~

<JOHNNY: Okay, now this is just not needed. What did she ever do to
deserve this?>

~*Ditto (Being dumb, you may not have gathered that i'm a big
Ryouko fan)*~

(<STEVE: I did, actually. Being dumb you may not have gathered that I am
a Ryoko fan as well.>)

>WIP!<
>Smack!<
>Smash<
>Slap!<
 They continued to beat her fo 20minutes.

sasami picked up the dick she used to fuck ryouko with and smacked her
across
the face  with it.

<TILL: (at screen) I will gouge your eyeballs out and SKULL FUCK YOU!>

~*and WHAT?*~

(<TILL: SKULL FUCK YOU! It's not a hard concept to grasp. It's kind of
funny that you accuse us of being dumb when you fail to understand the
simplest of things!>)

"Come on Sasami, let's give her to the dog's."

"good Idea!"

The two of them walked out and called the dogs in.

<STEVE: Which were all rabid Saint Bernards and tore the two apart, the
end.>

~*They were reabid, if you'd read the other parts*~

(<STEVE: There, I was right, so be quiet.>)

Those dog's fucked
Ryouko
all night long...The sounds of her screem's could be heard by the
other's
echoing in the hall way.

<NASTICA: Goddammit...>

"Hey Washu? How are we gonna get Ayeka?."

"That my little demon, i'll leave entirely up to you."

With that, the two kissed and made hardcore passionate love for the rest

of
the night....

<CROW: Oh, NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! There's going to be another one?!>
<SHARRIN: Not unless we get to the author first...>
__________________________________________________________________
Hello, how did you like my fic?

<ALL: WE FUCKING HATED IT!>

~*And your MST, It sucked!*~

(<STEVE: And once again, SO DOES YOURS! You're not one to put yourself
in the position to judge.>)

I'd love to hear from you all.

<CROW: And that you will.>

Last time
I
recieved over 100 e-mails telling me how much you all loved my fic, and
I
will definatley continue writing.

<ALL: WHAT?!>
<TILL: There are people that encourage this crap?!>
<JOHNNY: Those people must be dealt with as well.>
<STEVE: $100 says that they're all other lemon writers.>

~*What have you got against lemon writers?

(<STEVE: It's rare to come across a decent lemon. Most of them have poor
spelling, grammar, and plots. That's why.>)

Anyway writting a lemon MST qualifies you as a lemon writer*~

(<TILL: It does?>)
(<STEVE: No, this jackoff is just full of it.>)

Bare with me, the series is not over yet.

<TILL: (moans painfully) Why?>

~*Because*~

(<CROW: Because what? Answer me!>)

P.S.
Thank you all for your support.

Everyone exits the theater mumbling angrily to themselves.

~*Screams are heard as I butcher them.*~

(<JOHNNY: I don't remember that happening?>)
(<TILL: The six of us against one. I would've incinerated the bastard
before any words could be spoken.>)

(Stinger)
Washu continued to screem as she continued to blast cum all over the
place:
on the ceilling, on all the walls, completely saturating the bed
blankets so
soaked, that the cum leaked all the way down through the sheet's to the
matress, Not to mention all over Sasami; who was head to toe covered in
cum.

~*What, no comments?*~

(<STEVE: No, because it's a stinger, you jackass!>)
(<CROW: There we go; my theory is correct.>)
