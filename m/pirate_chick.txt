READ THIS, DAMNIT! I READ ALL OF YOUR DISCLAIMERS!

Disclaimer: hello again! It's me, your worst nightmare. Oh well, I
think Avril Lavigne totally rocks. You must to if you're reading
this.               If you don't, deal with it. Anyways, I don't own
Avril Lavigne or "Sk8er Boi" That goes to copyright to-hold on, lemme
get the CD. Okay, Arista Records. <(Oo)>

Tenchi Muyo! on the other hand belongs to (unfortunately) AIC and
Pioneer. You people better get to work on OAV 3. And it better be
good. 
If you want the original lyrics to the song, e-mail me. 
If you want to _hear_ the song, go to "www.avrillavigne.com", make
sure your speakers are on, and it'll play. If it doesn't, you can
listen to it on the site anyways. Just press the right buttons.  
If you have the CD and heard the song before, (like me), Put it in
your computer disk drive a blast the speakers out with it, which I am
doing right now. 

Have fun, kiddies!

The cast of Tenchi Muyo (yes, even Kagato) sits in a packed arena
looking up at an empty stage. The lights dim and everyone cheers as
Avril Lavigne comes on to the stage. The band tunes up and begins to
play "Sk8er Boi".
Ryoko jumps up and down cause she knows all the words, like Washu.
Tenchi likes the music, unlike Ayeka who is covering her ears. 
Sasami jumps around with Ryo-ohki while Mihoshi sit in her chair
and eats her large popcorn, cheese fries, 2 hot dogs, and a coke. 
(I don't own Coca Cola, either.) 
Kagato screams like a girl and holds up a sign that reads "I'll be
your Sk8ter Boi, Avril!"
                          
  "Pirate Chick"

She was a girl,
He was a boy,
Can I make it anymore obvious?
She was a thief,
He worked in the patch,
She became too attached!

She wanted him
He'd never tell
Secretly he wanted her as well!
But the princess
Stuck up her nose
She had a problem with her revealing clothes!


Chorus:
She was a pirate chick
The one that he didn't pick
He broke her heart and made her cry!
He had a handsome face
But his head was up in space
Literally, he was on Jurai!

5 years from now
He sits on his throne
Ayeka just used, him he's all alone!
He checks the small screen
Guess who he sees?
Pirate chick moved on and got married!


She's with Ibara
His eyes show he's sad
He just realized the true chance he had!
He knew who he loved
And now she has fame
Ibara rocks on, Tenchi takes the blame!


Chorus 2 times 

She was a pirate chick
The one that he didn't pick
He broke her heart and made her cry!
He wants to see her now
Will she forgive him? He doubts.
As he takes off into the sky!

Mad Guitar Solo -->

Bridge: 

As he nears the wealthy house
He sees Ibara with his spouse
When Ryo-uh hits the ground
His legs can't move, his lips won't sound.

He swallows hard and makes his way
Rehearsing what he's gonna say
He doesn't recognize that girl
Who's now the woman in his world.

She watches him,  
He watches her,     
As she moves her lips to form these small words     
"Tenchi, oh please                            
Come back to me!
I can't live without you in my world!"

After a 10-minute kiss
She tells him how much she missed,
Him after he left Japan back home!
Taking off on their cabbit ship
Kissing each others lips
Not worried about being alone!

Ryo-ohki and Ryo-uh chat
While Tenchi screams, "Jerk, take that!"
Pointing at Ibara down below!
But Ibara doesn't care
He just liked Ryoko's hair
But Tenchi's true love for her will show!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Avril is shaken out of her dream state about the huge audience and
the band begins to play and rehearses all alone in an empty
auditorium. Outside the window, 2 cabbit ships fly into space...



END! The reason why I said, "Ibara rocks on" is because he became a
ROCK STAR! That's why Ryoko has fame. Duh. Even though half the words
didn't rhyme, I seriously don't care.
I wrote it at 2:00 in the morning last night. It just popped into my
head COMPLETELY oblivious to the fact that my friend also gave me the
idea. (Shhhh!) 
You know the basics! 
Classic "No Doubt" and Foo Fighters kick major ass. 
Kill Sakuya. (Ayeka is okayâ€¦sorta. You know she wears a wig, right?
Sorry Gensao, but I've got the comic to prove it. Plus, she's very
evil, so, Ayeka=Bad.)
T and R forever! Email me at DarkblueRoots23@aol.com! I am such a
cutie-pie! C-ya! <(Oo)>
