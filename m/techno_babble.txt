SEION: Washu is the intellectual property of Pioneer LCD.
Washu's ass-kissing puppets are the prpoerty of Washu.

WASHU: HEY! What did I tell you about your language?
(anguished sigh)
SEION: Little Washu, the greatest scientific genius in the universe is the intellectual propety of
Pioneer LDC. Little Washu's ass-kissing puppet's are the property of Little Washu.
(Little Washu throws her arms around him)
WASHU: I'm so happy!
SEION: Can we get on with this Little Washu?
WASHU: Sure! Why not!
SEION: Okay, Jimmy! Say the line I'm paying you through the nose for!

JAMES EARL JONES: Seion Presents: TECHNOBABBLE: or How to talk like Washu-
WASHU: Get it right!
J.E. JONES: How to talk like Little Washu.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	It seems that though alot of people try, they just can't write the scientific type phrases
that the Little creature that lives under Tenchi's stairs is famous for saying. Instead they'll
just come up with a layman's phrase. I am here to help solve this problem. We'll start off with
inventions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Inventions by far are the easiest thing to Technobabble. And here's how it's done. Take an
object. Any object'll do. Now here's the fun part. Attatch one, two or three scientific sounding
words to it. For instance, Television! Now put a couple of technical sounding words to the front.
HUZZAH! You now have a Laser-Holographic projection Television! Now was that so hard? In case you
need help, here's a little list of Washuish Terms.

Holographic
Hydro (water)
Pyrotechnic(fire)
Atmospheric(the air)
Condensor
Geothermic(heat from the earth)
Laser
Magnetic
Electro-magnetic
Particle
Dimensional
Biological
Centrifical
Gravitation 
Fusion
You get the idea...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	This one's just a little bit harder! To talk like Little Washu when she's trying to 
explain the invention you just created take this advice. GET A THESARUS! Come up with what the
device does in layman's terms and got through the Thesarus to look up the most complicated way 
of saying the same phrase. Just like when Little Washu was explaining what the Dimensional Tuner
does it Time and Space Episode 1. Soon you'll be on your way to start sounding like the greatest
scientific genius the world has ever known! And won't that be swell? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	And now for the puppets. They can say more than "Your the greatest, Washu!" Just use 
simple and short sentences that always begin or end with "Washu" and you'll be set. Take this 
for example.

Washu (the older version with the better body) comes out dressed as a Geisha. The Washu puppets
pop out on to her shoulders dressed the same way.
WASHU A: You're a babe, Washu!
WASHU B: The hottest ever, Washu!

See. It's not that hard to use these two.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	And it's not that hard to write anything concerning Little Washu. Now writing for Mihoshi,
that's hard!

WASHU...............................Yuko Kobayashi/K.T. Vaugh
SEION...............................Tetsuya Iwanaga/Patrick M. Stewart
JAMES EARL JONES....................What? Did you really think I could afford him. Turn this 
                                    reader into a watersprite, Little Washu!

If you don't see the humor in the previous fic, I don't want to hear about it! That's you tough
luck! If you liked it, Then let me know!

The previous fic contained highly technical terms and should not have been read by the completly
stupid.
