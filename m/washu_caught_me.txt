All anime characters mentioned here

This is a parody of Shaggy (natually)
and I hope you enjoy it even though it has not 
clear themes except that Tenchi really is 
taking things for granted. 
It's a little adult (but only a little) 
so you may like to be cautious. Or
not. It's your own decision.
So sit back for...
WASHU CAUGHT ME RED HANDED!
or even red nosed or red haired, 
but those don't rhyme. 

Jim

Intro: 
     Tenchi and Ryoko: 
     (Hi Ryoko) Hi 
     (Open up) What do you want? 
     (Washu just caught me) 
     You let her catch you? 
     (And she made a suggestion that I might like to...you know) 
     With who? 
     (Everyone) Why?.... 
     (She said I was repressed) Okay, let's do it!
     (Alright) 

     Chorus: 
     Washu came in and she caught me red-handed 
     With my light hawk wings next door 
     Picture this it looked a little bit listless
     Added an inch or four
     How could i forget 
     that she could phase right through the floor? 
     It's not my fault that I can't
     Control my feelings any more

     Washu: 
     In my opion you've gone completely loco
     I ask you, what about Ayeka and Ryoko?
     You could go with one of them if your bored
     But you just sit here extending your sword
     Now if your too shy listen to me
     I'll show you how, just you see
     You'll thank me once I've shown you the way
     Or have you decided that your gay?	


     Verse 2: 
     Now I can go and ask Ayeka 
     (I wanna see) 
     Ryoko said that I can take her
     (I wanna see) 
     I'll have a little of Mihoshi
     (I wanna see) 
     With a side order of Kiyone
     (I wanna see) 
     Maybe even Sesami
     (I wanna see) 
     She's getting to look like Tsunami
     (I wanna see) 
     I think I'll go back to Sayuka
     (I wanna see) 
     I wonder who'll be mother to Mayuka?

     Repeat Chorus 
     Washu came in..... 

     Verse 3: 
     I tried to keep them from seeing my manhood rise
     Why should I step out of my room just to get a nose bleed and 
     two crossed eyes?
     Make sure she knows it's you who got erect
     The right perix whenever she make get a longer gigalo flex
     Jurian\ human coupling isn't that complex 
     But livin' in the house is enough to get you vexed     
     You know with every girl after your half human ass
     Hardly recollecting what it's like for girls to pass 
     Your answer: love your women from the mountain to the grass
     They might lose intrest so you'd better act fast

     Repeat Verse 2 
     Nagi can be my girl today 
     (I wanna see) 
     I'm sure she'd like some different prey
     (I wanna see) 
     Yugi isn't that bad lookin'
     (I wanna see) 
     Inferno is so hot she's cookin'
     (I wanna see) 
     I need someoe to free me
     (I wanna see) 
     It could even be Bulma and Chi Chi
     (I wanna see) 
     The sailor scouts as well
     (I wanna see) 
     All anime girls are hot as hell

     Repeat Chorus 
     Washu came in.... 

     Verse 4: 
     How could I forget 
     The use of my Tenchi-ken? 
     All this time with these girls in here
     And they thought I was in to men
     Gonna tell them that i'm sorry for the frustration I've caused 
     Cos the've seen my repression 
     For far too long for me to pause  
     I'll go to each of their rooms, maybe give them a fright 
     They thought I was a player 
     And now their completely right 

     Repeat Chorus 
     Washu came in....
