*[Satellite of Slight Insecurity - A camera switches on. Static is 
present, but soon fades.  Relm faces the camera with a smile.]

*Relm:  "Hi everyone, Relm here.  It's been a while since we got here 
and we're wondering where Kefka is."
*Rydia(from off camera):  "Hey Relm!!!  Get over here, it's starting!"
*Relm:  "We've discovered that the SOSI was much larger than we thought.  
There's a whole wing off from the kitchen and a second floor."
*Rydia(storms on screen):  "Are we deaf!?!?"
*Relm:  "Hey!  I'm trying to do my monologue, do you mind?"
*Rydia:  "Oh, sorry" (looks at camera)  "You tell them about the cool 
stuff we found?"
*Relm:  "Well, I was about to."
*Rydia(to camera):  "It's so cool!!!  We found a whole library of books 
on magic, and a shrine for summoning monsters, and a training room, and 
--"
*Relm(angrily):  "MY MONOLOGUE!!!" 
*(Relm shoves Rydia of screen and takes a moment to compose herself)
*Relm:  "Don't worry, we're all friends here.  Anyways, Vivi's going to 
show all of us some new magic he learned, so we're having a talent 
show."

*[A few minutes later in a newly discovered auditorium -  Vivi sits in 
the center of the stage in a trance while the others look on]

*Relm:  "So Aeris, how long has Vivi been like that?"
*Aeris:  "About ten minutes now.  He was getting impatient, so he 
decided to harness his power for a good show"
*Rydia(yelling):  "Vivi!  Move your ass!"

*(Vivi suddenly begins to glow and stands up slowly.  Obviously ready, 
he nods for everyone to stand back)

*Aeris:  "That's different."
*Relm:  "Uh, maybe we should move into the other room."
*Rydia:  "But then we couldn't see.  Let's just stare at Vivi 
dumbfounded."
*Aeris:  "Works for me."
*Relm:  "Um, okay."

*(Vivi raises his hands and an explosion rocks the SOSI.)

* [Some time later -  A camera pans towards the charred remains of a 
stage.  Chairs are strewn about and four semiconscious figures emerge 
from under a lighting scaffolding]

*Relm:  "Okay... What was that?"
*Aeris:  "I'd say a ten"
*Rydia:  "Good style, but I gotta take off points for destroying the 
stage and hurting the judges"
*Vivi(on the other side of the room):  "I did it!!  I mastered the 
explosion spell!"
*Relm:  "Uh... Vivi,  Weren't you working on a transportation spell to 
get us home?"
*Vivi:  "Oh yea...  Teleport, that's what I was supposed to do."

*(All sigh audibly.   Suddenly a light begins to blink, signaling an 
emergency on the bridge)

*[Soon after, on the bridge -  The flat screen is displaying a visibly 
disturbed Kefka.  The occupants of the SOSI emerge from a side door]

*Kefka:  "It took you long enough!  where were you."
*Relm:  "Vivi almost killed us.  We were in the kitchen, having ice 
cream of course."
*(Kefka stares at the crew of the SOSI then smiles)
*Kefka:  "Well I guess this is getting to you.  Everyone said it would."
*Aeris:  "What do you mean 'Everyone?'"
*Kefka:  "The guys at the convention."

*(All look blankly at Kefka.)

*Kefka:  "You didn't get the message I left you?"
*Rydia:  "Message?  We thought you left us here to die."
*Kefka:  "Nah, that's not my style.  I just went to the annual Evil 
Genus Convention in Seattle.  It was hosted by some guy named Bill, he 
was a bit of a geek, but I got some pointers from him."
*Vivi:  "Well, what do you want Kef?"
*Kefka:  "To torture my little lab rats, of course."

*(Vivi stares blankly at Kefka)

*Kefka:  "You are dense, aren't you?"
*Aeris:  "Yep."
*Vivi:  "Hey!"
*Kefka:  "Shut up you two, and get ready for some new and improved 
cruelty."

*(A new door suddenly appears and the fanfic lights begin to flash.  
Everyone obediently walks through the door and promptly smash into a 
pane of glass.)

*Relm:  "Hey, what's the deal Kef?  Practical jokes aren't your usual 
thing."
*Kefka:  "It's no joke, my dear.  That Bill guy made some good 
suggestions.  One of them was to get rid of the boring doors and force 
you all to use Windows.  Muahahahahahahahaha."
*All: ???
*Kefka:  "He even said that he'd send me some, but the shipment was 
delayed.  Bugs, or something like that.  I told him to call an 
exterminator and he just laughed, so I just bought my own."
*Aeris:  "So.. how do we get by."
*Kefka :  "I don't actually know.  This Bill was one evil genus.  It 
probably involved some great mystery..."
*Relm:  "You mean like a lever?"

*(As Kefka begins to reply, Vivi creates a small explosion, shattering 
the glass)

*Kefka:  "Hey!!!  That was expensive"

*(Everyone walks away into the theatre)

*Kefka:  "Hey, get back here!"

*[All take their seats and begin to groan in dismay]

*Kefka(over theatre PA):  "Well, You knew this was going to come sooner 
or later, so prepare yourself for the much anticipated part 2 of the 
lemon that will destroy you and make me famous in the Evil Genius 
community."
*Rydia:  "Please leave now."
*Vivi:  "Can I go too?"
*Aeris:  "No, you have to stay here and take it.  Remember our talk."
*(Relm and Rydia look at each other and burst out laughing)
*Aeris:  "Shut your mouths.  It was about outlasting torture you 
sickos."
*Kefka:  "Well, I'll leave you to your fate then.  see you soon"

*(The screen darkens and flashes a countdown)

*Vivi:  "I can do this. I can do this..."

>This is a Tenchi Muyo Hentai/Lemon Fanfic of the wildest type! This is 
DEFENTLY not 
>for children! Wait a sec.....if u were a child any way.. YOU PROBABLY 
WOULDNT 
>UNDERSTAND THIS AT ALL SO WHY IS THERE A "WARNING" IN THE FIRST 
>PLACE???

*Relm:  "I remember this.."
*Rydia: "Oh... Crap...  It's" 

>Part 2 of the "No Need For Virgins" Lemon fan/fic series. *Innocent No 
More* 
>By: AncientYUME

*All:  "No!!!!!!"
*Vivi:  "The Horror.  The pain.  The headaches."
*Aeris:  "It'll be ok Vivi, just remember our training"

*(Rydia and Relm again burst out laughing.  Aeris turns and stares at 
them until they stop.)

>Featuring Tenchi and Ayeka! 

*Relm:  "Is it me, or does this sound like a game show?

>The night rolled in

*Rydia:  "In its brand new car!"

>as the sun went down behind the hilly mountains.

*Vivi:  "Ignoring the flat mountains because they were just plain 
silly."

>The Masaki home fell victim to the echoes and sounds of the night.

*Aeris(echoes and sounds):  "Give us your money and no one gets hurt."

>Bugs chirped and whistled outside Tenchi's window. Tenchi was resting 
on his bed, 
>starring at the ceiling, thinking of what happened earlier that day. 
When everyone left the 
>house and he and Sasami were alone together. 

*Vivi:  "It's happening again!"
*(Vivi pulls a bottle from his pocket and holds on to it for dear life)
*Relm:  "What's that?"
*Vivi:  "I made some strong medicine from an alchemy kit I found in a 
back room.  Horrible writing will not hurt me."
*Relm:  "cool."

>He couldn't bring himself to believe what he did. It was all a blur, a 
mer moment of 
>pleasure
 
*Rydia: "He's on a satellite too?"
*Aeris: "That's 'mer' not 'MIR'!"
*Rydia:  What's 'mer'?"
*Vivi:  "The reason I have to take this" (holds up bottle of medicine)

>quickly faiding away from him. Sasami's panting and moaning still rang 
in his ears. He 
>imagined her on the table, nude underneath him. 

*Aeris:  "Man, I just forgot that... Damn flashbacks..."

>Then he remembered when the others came home. 

*Vivi: "When was that again?"

>When Ayeka and Grandfather came home from the store. 

*Vivi:  "Oh yea, thanks."

>He gasped at the thought again. 

*Relm(the thought):  "How rude!"

>How Ayeka almost saw him, nude with her sister, on the table, and in a 
sexual pose. 

*Rydia:  "So after their little romp, Tenchi and Sasami decided to stay 
on the table and do a photo shoot?"

>He then thought of when he quickly picked up all the cloths and carried 
Sasami into the 
>back room, where they quickly got dressed, and darted upstairs. Fearing 
to face the 
>others. 

*Aeris:  "So, instead of having a complete flashback, he's remembering 
each detail one at a time?"
*Rydia:  "That's pretty much it."

>The thoughts excited him. His cock grew harder ever second. 

*Relm:  "Uh... Can't the author wait a while before he/she does that?"

>*Whats wrong with me!* He thought *I....I can't possibly wanna do it 
again?* 

*Vivi(Tenchi):  "Of course its entirely possible that I might 'want to' 
do it though."

>The more he though about it, the more he couldn't resist. Yes, he 
wanted it again, 

*Vivi:  "See, I was right."
*Aeris:  "And your happy about that?"
*Vivi(shocked):  "Oh... crap, I take it all back"

>and he wanted it bad. His body desired more pleasure, and he couldn't 
control it. He 
>stood up in his bed, and he looked at his bedroom door. *What am I to 
do? 

*Rydia(door):  "How the hell should I know!?"

>Should I go....go an ask Sasa.....

*Rydia(door):  "Hey genius,  I'm a door!  You want advice, ask the 
bookcase."

>No! I can't do that to her again.* His mind raced on. He stood up and 
rubbed his head,

*Vivi:  "'Cause we know how much thinking hurts Tenchi's head."

>his eyes half open, and still locked upon his bedroom door. 

*Rydia(door):  "Get those eyes back in your head and off my new stain 
finish!"

>Then, he made up his mind. 

*Aeris:  "Mihoshi really should stop leaving her eye shadow and lipstick 
in Tenchi's room." 

>He was going...going for a drink of water. He slowly walked toward his 
door. He then 
>gripped the handle, turning it slowly. Tenchi opened the door 

*Relm:  "Intense, door opening action."

>and aimlessly stepped out into the hallway. 

*Vivi:  "After about five minutes of slamming into the door frame, he 
decided on a direction and walked through the doorway."

>When he turned and looked down the stairway, Ayeka was looking back at 
him with 
>great surprise. 

*Rydia(Ayeka):  "Oh, Tenchi!  Why do I have this money?  Well... I'm 
counting it for Grandfather,  go back to sleep!"

>"Lord Tenchi?" Ayeka whispered, "What are you doing up so late at 
night?" "Ayeka, 
>what a surprise to see you here." Tenchi smiled. 

*Aeris:  "Ayeka was surely loosing it.  She talked to herself a lot 
these days.  It was best just to smile and nod."

>"I was getting some water." He giggled and rubbed his head. 

*Relm(Tenchi):  "Water.  That's great, I got to write that one down."

>"Water?",Ayeka said softly, " On, Lord Tenchi I can get you some water! 

*(Vivi begins to shake and decides to take some of his medicine)

>Go back in your room now." "Uhhh ok Miss Ayeka?', Tenchi said 
dumbfoundly. 

*Rydia(Tenchi):  "You are Miss Ayeka right?"

>So he slowly turned and reentered his room. He approached his bed and 
sat down upon 
>it.

*(All look at Vivi as he begins to take more medicine)

>"Wow, I didn't expect to see lady Ayeka out there. 

*Relm:  "You know, seeing as how she lives here and all."

>What a real coensedence." Tenchi said to himself. Without warning Ayeka 
stormed into 
>his room holding a small glass of water. 

*Aeris(Ayeka):  "Tenchi!  This glass of water insulted me, I demand 
vengeance!"

>She was wearing a silk night kimono. She didn't appear to be wearing 
any undergarments 
>at all. 

*Rydia(Tenchi):  "I love this new X-ray vision Washuu gave me.

>She closed the door and slowly walked over to Tenchi, bent down in 
front of him, and 
>gave him the water. Tenchi then excepted the water,

*Relm:  "It lost all rights and privileges as a liquid of his house."

>smiling, while then suddenly catching a glimpse of Ayeka cleavage. She 
smiled at him as 
>he drank the water. *A damn, no, i can't.......*He thought.

*Vivi:  "Why?"
*Aeris:  "We'll never know."

>Tenchi then finished the water and put the glass down the floor. "Thank 
you Ayeka." 
>Tenchi whispered. "Your Welcome lord Ten...."She was cut short,

*Rydia:  "Failing with the 2 inch knife, Tenchi opted for the long sword 
by his bed."

>when Tenchi forced a kiss upon her. Her eyes opened wide with surprise, 
but she didn't 
>resist him as he put his arms around her. She allowed her self to fall 
upon him. She knew, 
>she had always wanted Tenchi to kiss her, to love her. 

*Relm:  "But definitely not to cut her.  She would remember to talk to 
him about that."

>Now this was her chance; Ryoko was gone and she was alone with Tenchi. 
He then 
>brought her on top of him on the bed. Their kiss became more 
passionate, and required 
>more motion. 

*Vivi:  "I'm not even going to ask."

>Tenchi then began to move his tongue into Ayeka's mouth. She quickly 
caught on and 
>did the same. Their hands wandered all over each other. Tenchi began to 
cup her firm, 
>round breasts. 

*Rydia:  "This recipe requires two cups of firm--"
*Aeris:  "Please, don't."

>He rubbed them and played with them while they were under the kimono. 

*Relm:  "After several unsuccessful rounds of Hide-and-go-Seek, Tenchi 
rethought his plan.

>Tenchi then began to feel around them, trying to get under the kimono. 
He found the 
>edges and he grassed them;

*Aeris(Tenchi):  "A thick layer of Kentucky blue is preferred for silk 
kimonos, but any low light seed will due."
*Rydia:  "I'd check your words if I were you."

>pulling the kimono away from her chest. The kimono pulled over her 
breasts. Tenchi 
>couldn't fully remove it, for Ayeka 

*Relm:  "... had used quick setting epoxy for fear of getting a chill."

>still had the kimono tied. So the edges of the kimono were held in 
place by Ayeka's hard
>nipples. 

*(All but Vivi get a chill down their spines)

>Ayeka broke their passionate kiss as she moaned with delight. Tenchi, 
unable to hold 
>himself back any longer, rolls Ayeka over. Tenchi was now over her. 

*Vivi(public address):  "please remember to keep the past in the past.   
Thank you"

>Ayeka was underneath him, her breasts firm and visible. 

*Aeris:  "Don't take this for granted girls, for sometimes they can 
become invisible.  Take for instance my collogues Relm and Rydia."
*Relm / Rydia:  "Were only 10!!!"

>He untied her kimono and lifted it over her legs. 

*Vivi:  "What the???   How the???"
*Relm:  "What's wrong?"
*Vivi:  "What kind of position would she have to be in?"
*Relm:  "Don't think about it.  It'll only make things worse."

>He revealed Ayeka's shaven cunt. 

*Aeris:  "Something I did not want to know."

>*She didn't wear undergarments after all* He thought. Ayeka blushed and 
looked away. 
>Tenchi then took off all his clothes. 

*Rydia:  "In a completely unentertaining way not worthy of description.

>Ayeka was filled with surprise when she saw Tenchi pull out his hard 
cock. 

*Relm:  "Obviously they didn't have sex-ed on Jurai."

>*Oh my God! What's he doing......I..* 

*Rydia:  "They didn't have commonsense on Jurai either."

>Her mind raced. Spareing no time, Tenchi opened Ayeka's legs. He placed 
him member 
>before Ayeka's love tunnel. 

*Aeris:  "Ohh, clever euphemisms.  I like." 

>Tenchi then began to enter her. "No Tenchi! Not...No!"Ayeka screamed. 

*Relm(Ayeka):  "Not no, yes.  I think that's it... Yes, it's yes, not 
no."

>Tenchi failed to notice her cries as his cock drove into her tight 
pussy. Ayeka squealed 
>with pain, 

*Aeris:  "As Tenchi's tires did the same."
*Relm(Tenchi):  "I love spinning the tires... it makes me look so cool."

>and Braced her hands on Tenchi waste

*All:  "EWWWW!"
*(Vivi takes another swig of the medicine and is visibly calmed down.)

>as he continued to drive deep into her. His hot cock filled her. Tenchi 
grabbed her right 
>foot with his left hands 

*Rydia:  "Eep!  Washuu's doing more experiments on Tenchi."

>and held her left leg firm in a pose with his other hand. The sudden 
pain over took 
>Ayeka, and she gasped for breath. Tenchi was moving very quickly, 
giving her no time to 
>react to his actions. All she could do now was go along with him. 
Tenchi paused when 
>his cock was all in her. He glanced down at Ayeka and grinned. His 
sexual actions 
>appear to resemble rape than love. 

*Vivi:  "The pain... is gone!  Yay!!!"

>This was the first sign, the first sign that Tenchi loosing his mind; 
to sex. 

*Rydia:  "Vivi. could you give me some of that medicine?"
*Vivi:  "I don't have much left."
*Rydia:  "Give it!  I need this pain to stop."

>He then began to move in and out of her slowly. Ayeka panting lightly 
with ever drive.

*Aeris:  " 'Ever Drive' from the people who brought you 'rape right'."

>She still griped tightly upon Tenchi's waste. 

*(Vivi begins to convulse violently.  He drinks the rest of his medicine 
and starts to sob quietly.)

>His long cock slowly pumping in and out of her virgin love tunnel. Her 
muscles squeezed 
>the hot member on every entry. Tenchi then let go of her legs and he 
gripped each side of 
>her waste. 

*Relm:  "I feel like I should make note of the unsanitary conditions in 
the Musaki house."

>Forcing Ayeka to take hold of his muscular arms. He began to speed up 
the pace. 
>Without warning he began to pump into Ayeka hard and fast. 

*Rydia:  "Wouldn't the speeding up be a warning?"
*Aeris:  "Thinking rationally in a lemon?  Shame on you Rydia."

>Her panting grew louder. Her large breasts began to sway back and forth 
within the >kimono. 

*Relm:  "Holy crap!  Ayeka has detachable breasts!!!"
*Vivi:  "What!?!"
*Relm:  "Tenchi took the kimono off her a while ago, but her breasts are 
still in it!"
*Vivi(Ayeka):  "Damn that washuu!"

>Love sweet love juice flowed from her like a river as her body 
convulsed. 

*Aeris:  "Yey, more euphemisms!"

>Her back arched and she squealed with pleasure. Unwilling to slow his 
pace, Tenchi let 
>go of Ayeka's waste and laid down on top of her. Placing his hands to 
by her side. 

*(Vivi begins to shake more and more despite his medicine)
*Aeris(soothing Vivi):  "There, there Vivi, it'll be over soon."

>Her legs rose up and locked and locked around him, 

*Relm(circus announcer):  "Let us now welcome Ayeka the rubber girl."

>then she threw her arms around him and drew him close to her. Her hard 
nipples pressed
>up against his chest as he rested on her firm breasts. Tenchi and Ayeka 
were face to face 
>now. He was glaring down at her, his face was firm and almost 
heartless. 

*Rydia:  "I'd sure hope so.  If not I'd have to damn Washuu, and her 
crazy experiments."

>Ayeka slowly opened her eyes to see her lovers face, and she was 
surprised to how he 
>was looking back. She would have spoken but her pants over whelmed her. 

*Aeris(Ayeka's pants):  "Ha.  I have bested you.  now bow down to me or 
I'll strangle you with my pull string.)

>Sweet began to form on their bodies. 

*Rydia:  "Sweet what?  If they're secreting sugar, I'm certainly going 
to have to damn that Washuu, and those crazy experiments of hers."

>Their hot breath blew into each other's faces. 

*Relm:  "While their cold breath supplied air conditioning for 
underprivileged Japanese sweatshop workers."

>He then laid his head down beside her on the bed, still driving into 
her with great force. 
>Tenchi began to slow. Ayeka felt his hands move under her back. 
Suddenly Tenchi 
>stopped driving into her, and he lifted her. 

*Aeris:  "...Began beeping and started to move in reverse."

>Ayeka cooperated as he began to roll over. She rolled onto his chest. 
Now she was on 
>top of him, Tenchi's hot cock still pulsing inside her love tunnel. She 
quickly placed her 
>hands on his stomach, and began to ride him. 

*Relm:  "Weeeeeee Weeeeeee Weeeeeee Wee-" 
*Rydia:  "We get it!" 

>Tenchi laid there, looking up Ayeka now doing all he fucking on her 
own. 

*(Vivi begins to cry and Aeris consoles him)

>He never expected her to enjoy his sudden push onto her, but because of 
her great love 
>for him. 

*Rydia:  "Now the author isn't even trying."
*Relm:  "Typing with one hand, I bet."

>She didn't resist. Ayeka bounced on him quickly and with great force. 
He panting, mixed 
>with squeals of pleasure and sudden shocks of pain, grew louder and 
louder with ever 
>entry of his cock. 

*(Vivi finally passes out from exhaustion.  The others fear for his 
safety and their sanity as the fic continues)

>Tenchi reached up and began to untie her sash. Soon after the kimono 
fell away. Ayeka's 
>breasts were bouncing up and down, and he couldn't resist them. 

*Rydia:  "Good thing Vivi's out cold, he would have flipped with the 
plot inconsistencies."
*Aeris:  "You call this a plot?"
*Rydia:  "Good point."

>He took hold of them with each hand and he began to squeeze and play. 

*Relm(Ayeka's nipples):  "Marco!"
*Aeris(Tenchi):  "Polo!"

>Grabbing her nipples, twisting them, gripping her round breasts with 
great force. 
>Pleasure over whelmed Tenchi as they fucked. 

*Relm(Pleasure):  "All I know is that Whelmed and Tenchi are below me."

>He rushed through him like a drug. 

*Aeris(Tenchi):  "How I love being omnipotent."

>It gave him a mind numbing high. His hands wandered down to Ayeka's 
waste and he 
>began to aid Ayeka with her bouncing. 

*Relm:  " 'Bounce Aid', a two day event of music, food, and fun."

>She pushed down harder and harder on Tenchi's stomach with every thrust 
of his cock. 
>Then Tenchi began to sit up. Forcing Ayeka to sit on his lap. She threw 
her arms around 
>him once more. 

*Rydia:  "Effectively snapping her forearm and puncturing Tenchi's 
jugular."

>His hands still aiding Ayeka as she bounced. 

*Aeris:  "I cannot stress enough the importance of verbs."

>She continued to ride him. Suddenly, Tenchi felt it once more. His cock 
began to swell 
>and buckle. 

*Aeris:  "The viscosity was tearing his piston apart."

>His teeth locked, his face stiffened. He tried with all of his might to 
prevent the 
>unpreventable. 

*Relm:  "Clearly a futile gesture worthy of recognition."

>Tenchi struggled to get Ayeka to stop or slow. 

*Rydia(Tenchi):  "Okay Ayeka.  1..2..3.. Red-light"

>Her climax was near, she would not, and she was too caught up in 
pleasure to notice. 
>Realizing it was too late he forced Ayeka down onto his cock and it 
shot up in her love
>tunnel. That sudden amount of pleasure forced Tenchi to lower his 
defenses. 

*Aeris:  "And in that short moment, anarchy broke out over the entire 
planet."

>A few seconds later Tenchi shot his loud of hot cum up into her wet 
love tunnel. 

*Relm:  "S-P-E-L-L C-H-E-C-K!!!"

>Ayeka cried with pleasure as wave after wave of cum ejected deep into 
her. 

*Rydia:  "Soon flooding the entire house and drowning the horny couple."

>Ayeka appeared to faint as she fell upon Tenchi and forced him down 
onto the bed. Her 
>naked body laid on top of him, he snapped back into reality and gently 
pushed her off of 
>him. She fell onto the bed beside him. 

*Aeris:  "Two beds, and amazing plot contrivance." 

>He rubbed his head and looked upon Ayeka sleeping soundly next to him. 
Sitting up, he
>foiled with the blankets and freed them out from under her. 

*Relm:  "Somebody's been watching HGTV lately, haven't they?"

>He stood up out of the bed and threw the blanket over Ayeka, and tucked 
her in. He 
>knelt down and kissed her on the check. Turning toward the door, he 
scrambled to find 
>his clothes. He quickly put them on and headed for the door. Before he 
left the room, he
>looked back at Ayeka and felt a sudden impulse of shame and 
displeasure. He has just 
>realized what he had just done. 

*Rydia:  "He had lost his bedroom."

>He took something from her that should have been taken on a better 
occasion. 

*Aeris:  "Although, that water had been mean to her..."

>He turned, sighed, and closed the door behind him. 

*(Vivi awakens slowly.  He is still somewhat out of it)
*Vivi:  "Is it over?"
*Relm:  "I think so.  He just left the room."
*Vivi:  "Great!  I don't think I could take any more of that."
 
>To be continued... ----------------------------------------------------
-------- >------------------------------------------------------------ -
---------------------- 

*All:  "Ahhhhhh!!!!!!"
*(Vivi faints, Aeris catches him and they all file out of the theatre.  
They all hear the echoes of the last horrifying words as they return to 
the bridge...)

>Next time: Part 3! "The Day of the Carnival!" The exciting, heart 
pounding, next episode 
>of "No Need For Virgins" *Who's Tenchi's next victim of love as his 
mind slowly faids 
>away! Could it be "Mihoshi?"* 

*[Five minutes later - The bridge of the SOSI - Kefka addresses the 
crew.]

*Kefka:  "So... How was my masterpiece?"
*Relm:  "You are truly a sick man.  You hurt poor Vivi."
*Rydia:  "Yea, but that lemon was--"
*(All look at Rydia)
*Rydia: "... Horrible, just horrible.  Unspeakable evil.  Not erotic in 
the least."
*Kefka:  "Well, that's nice to hear.  So, what's with that mageling 
anyway?"
*Aeris:  "He took something to stop the fic from hurting so much."
*Kefka(shocked):  "An antidote to my torture!?!?!   What is it!?!"

Farewell you little scanks."

*** Well that concluded my second MST.  I hope you will think it's 
better than I do.  I'm probably going to do the third part in the saga 
in a few weeks.

Thanks go out to all of my friends who have supported me.   JMS, Tommy, 
and Kristen - Thanks for suggesting I continue MSTing.  

Lammy also wanted to be mentioned again, so...
                   Lammy = Mentioned Again.

Thanks for Reading.
