MODERN THEORY

Kazekera: Oh, you really should know what we are talking about
The theories are easy when you have the place of scout
For it was you, Washu, who proved that they were true
And worked the scientific logic out....

(Kaz jumps onto a table and forward flips up it to the main screen)

Oh, due to modern theory on partical dimensions
The easiest way is to work with your intentions

(He aquires a mortar board and teaching cape, and Washu joins him
wearing similar stuff pointing out eqations on the screen)

Kaz:    Make a histogram of data
Washu:	Work out the angle theta
Kaz:	Find the decimal irrational of Pi
	Look at the stars and galaxies and covoluted quasars
	Test your hyphthesis with pinpoint lasers

(The two jump off the table the were on)

Washu:	Make sure you have your formulas on hand so you are free
	C squared equals b squared a squared 2 a b COS C
Kaz: 	Mean, mode, range, standard deviation
Washu: 	Bionomial Theorum
Kaz: 	A quadratic equation

(They proceed down the central isle singing more slowly)

Washu: From the first time someone drew two lines an called it 
       add or plus
Kaz:   You have been the galaxies most celebrated science genius!

(They put their opposite arms in the air (one left, one right) and
do the jazz hands thing which people often do on these occasions)

Both:	Yeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!
