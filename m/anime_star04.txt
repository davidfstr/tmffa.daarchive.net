Except for Turbo Magnus and the Anime Star, nothing used in this story is my
property. I'm not paying to use the characters, nor am I making money from
them.

Anime Star MSTs #4
By: Turbo Magnus

The holodeck on the Anime Star was running a modified version of the Wooded
Parkland program, modified in the sense that the crew was taking a relaxing
break from MSTing and just having a picnic. Turbo and Relena were cooking
the meal while Hoag fished and Jok slept. Washu was working on her holotop.
Even the Author was there, barely even looking at his computer as it
automatically searched the TMFFA for fics to MST.

"Ya know Turbo, I almost hate to admit it, but this is actually fun." The
Author said as he sipped a root beer.

"Almost too bad Crow and Tom are off-line for repairs." Turbo replied from
the grill.

"Any MSTs planned for today?" Asked Relena, who was making potato salad.

"Even I wouldn't ruin this," the Author began, only to be interrupted by a
blaring siren.

"WHAT THE FLAMING SMEG IS THAT!?" Hoag screamed as Jok jerked awake and
everyone turned to look at the Author.

"P.O.S. Fic alert, only really bad fics get it." The Author answered while
he surveyed the fic, "Oh... Holy... Hell..."

That really got everyone's attention, the Author didn't swear unless he had
to. They all came running over to him, well, hopping in Hoag's case and
repeated the Author's words.

"Author, will we be MSTing this fic?" Washu asked.

"I won't make you." He replied, shivering because of the sickness of the
fic.

"We'll vote." Turbo said, "I say MST it."

"Agreed." Relena added.

"I'll go in with you." Jok said, willing to risk sanity because of how
Sasami was treated.

"No one like THAT will use MY name." Washu swore.

"Then it's agreed, it will be MSTed. I'll send temporary replacements for
Tom and Crow." The Author decreed and faded away.

[[[WELL, HEY, STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. I'VE WITNESSED MOST OF THEM AND
CAUSED THE REST.]]]

On his way to the projection room, Hoag gave the computer one last command,
"Computer, end program."

Door Sequence:
Door 1: The wreck of an Ultrasaurus, Turbo blasts it with a hand-held Pulse
Cannon.

Door 2: Dodge City, Jok guides them through.

Door 3: A river, they change into swimsuits, swim across and change back.
TURBO(thinking): Relena looks so beautiful normally, that bikini only
enhances that beauty
RELENA: Something wrong Turbo?
TURBO(coming back to reality): Huh? Nothing! Nothing!

Door 4: A School, thanks to Washu they pass all the grades and leave.

Door 5: An asteroid heading for Earth, Turbo just pulls the pulse cannon out
from subspace/hammerspace and blasts it.
TURBO: In honor of almost every Gundam series.
RELENA: Didn't you do this last time?
TURBO: Yeah...

[Fic Starts]
I DO NOT own Tenchi Muyo or anything else, they belong to AIC and Pioneer.
None of the characters, even the SI's are mine. But who cares. MWAHHAA!!

TURBO: Then you too will die.
RELENA: Tank Cop was first.
WASHU: We'll get you next.
JOK: So that's what you did with the Gundams and Zoid.

Kagato's Little Secret
TURBO: He's Lady Tokimi's boyfriend.

by Kagato's testacle
JOK(Turning green): Uuuurp.
WASHU(Barbara Stone from Ruthless People): I want to castrate him!
*Turbo and Jok cover their lower regions. *
(AUTHOR: Cue the new AniMSTers!)
>Lena from Zoids Zero and Trowa Barton from Gundam W come through the doors.

TROWA: Relena?
RELENA: Trowa? What are you doing here?
TROWA: Author picked me.
LENA: Lena and Relena? How ironic.
TURBO: She's a pacifist, not a trigger-happy lunatic.
LENA: WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?!?!
*Lena takes a mallet and hits Turbo. *
TURBO: Owwww.

Imagine the worst stories you've ever read.

TURBO: Bad.

Imagine the worst authors you've ever heard of in your life.

LENA: Worse.

Imagine what would happen if they banded together.

TROWA: Very bad.

You will find out here the worst that could possibly happen.

WASHU: I doubt it.

And one other thing.....SAKUYA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!

RELENA: That's probably going to be the last intelligent line in the story.
JOK: Yeah.
TURBO: ShIn TeNcHi EvIl!!!

MWAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHhAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ALL: EVIL!

In a small room, around a large red table, sat the most famous authors of
Tenchi Fics.

TURBO: Peter Suzuki, Ksawarrior, Happosai...

The first one was the ever pious AAA-Phucknut,

WASHU: Who told him he was Triple A material?

who was at the moment jacking off to the latest edition of Tenchi in Tokyo,

TURBO: NoT sHiN tEnChI!!!
RELENA: He does this whenever that series is mentioned...

where Tenchi has a graphic sex scene with Amagaski.

LENA: Tiny, isn't it?
WASHU: Yes...
TURBO: You're supposed to go "THAT'S THE SMALLEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!".

To his left was a small red-haired lady, she appeared to be an almost
identical copy of Washu, that was except for the mucus dripping tentacles in
her hair.

WASHU: NO ONE IMPERSONATES ME LIKE THAT!!! What's that line Heero always
says, Relena?
RELENA: "Omae o korosu?"
WASHU: That's the one. (To washuu@naughtytentacles.com) "Omae o korosu."

Next we had a normal looking boy, his eyes appeared to be vacant and his
stare was insidious. On his shirt was the picture of a policeman inside a
tank, below the picture were the words, Tankcop.

TURBO: He has met his maker.
RELENA: His maker became sick at the fact that one of his creations would
write ‘Sammy's Little Secret'.
*In the Projection Room, Hoag plays a rimshot. *

After him was a freaky young man who appeared to be an alien, on his shirt
was the number Fifty two.

TURBO: Alienboy 52, that sick bastard who wrote Tenchi on a Plate of
Sashimi.
*JOK throws up.*

There were many others after that but those were the ones that were
currently talking at the moment.

"It's pure genius!"

LENA(speaker): We'll ALL commit suicide!

Phucknut yelled out as he stroked his pale green salami.

TURBO: Standard Army issue meat.
OTHERS: URP! TURBO, THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!
TURBO: Sorry, I think my Sanity Limitations shut down when the fic started
so they wouldn't be destroyed.
RELENA: Just GREAT!
TURBO: How would you know?
LENA: STOP IT ALREADY!
RELENA: Don't bother, when he's like this the best thing to do is get a
bigger barf bag.

"MGPNobuyuki hasn't had a real gig since that part where he killed himself
after ripping off his dick!"

ALL: BAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!

"But" Washutentacles slithered out a she observed the authors. "I haven't
finished my story, Kagato Revenge must be finished. I have something even
worse in store for Sasami!

WASHU(Washutentacles): Tank Cop will write her into a fic called Sammy's
Little Secret! HAHAHAHAHA!!!

HAHAHAHAAH!!!"

JOK/LENA/TROWA: *Look nervously at Washu. *
TURBO: I guess they got Washu-chan's persona down right, even if it is
twisted.

She cackled madly and two tentacles slithered onto her shoulders and wiggled
around.

RELENA: Washutentacles's version of Puppets A and B?
TURBO: I guess.

"Tankcop, what about you?"

JOK: He's dead, Jim.
TURBO: Jok, you've just used a joke that is older than MSTing itself!
WASHU: We're so proud of you!
RELENA: You're a true AniMSTer now!

Alienboy52 asked as he turned towards the deranged youth. "You've been
silent since this meeting started."

TURBO(Tank Cop): The dead say very little.
JOK(Alienboy 52): What killed you?
TURBO(Tank Cop): The crew of the Anime Star.

Tankcop turned towards him and grinned maniacly.

"I believe I have the answer." All of the other members leaned towards him.
"I was thinking about this while my fics were being mst'ed by Ksawarrior and
his loser crew..

(AUTHOR: HEY! Ksa, Peter, The Crew of the SoL and a few others are some of
those who made me decide to take my MSTing habit and start writing MSTs!)
TURBO: Stay frosty.
(AUTHOR: Oh, I'm freezing space, Turbo.)

except for Rei of course. Our fics are deadly but they aren't nearly strong
enough,

(AUTHOR: Then team up with the guy who wrote Tenchi and His Gay Lovers!)
RELENA: You've... read that?
(AUTHOR: A MST of it. Still sickened me out.)

what we need to do is join forces.

JOK: Good, give us a shooting gallery.

We take all of our ideas and create the most horrid event ever,

LENA: A 24-hour Barney and Teletubbies Marathon!
OTHERS: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!

the most disgusting fic by far." A grunt is heard from Phucknut. "Yes?" He
asks as he turns towards him, just in time to take a full on load of jizz
onto his face.

ALL(AUTHOR included): BAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!

The white milky liquid lingured on his face and his began licking at it,
savoring the wonderful taste and incredible aroma. "Mmmm, what did you
have..cantaloupe?"

RELENA: "...Dad's got the car."
TURBO(Thinking): She's the most beautiful thing since Aphrodite, has a mind
like Sir Isaac Newton, and a sense of humor like B.F. Pierce. No wonder I'm
attracted to her.
(AUTHOR[To himself]: Plans of the Author maybe?)

Phucknut just smiles.

ALL: EVIL!

"Alright then..it's agreed." Alienboy52 spoke as he began to lick Tankcop's
face.

TROWA: Thank god.
ALL: *Look at him quizzically. *
TROWA: Could be lower.
ALL: Uuuurrrp.

Everyone began to move in on Phucknut and began to lick his face profusely.

--------------------D
TURBO: A blade on a chain.

*splurt*

Sammy walked down the stairs to her school in a hurry,

LENA(Sammy): Must... escape... evil... perverted... authors!
(AUTHOR: They're not perverts, or at least not true perverts.)
TURBO: How do you know?
(AUTHOR: Because I'm one and they're never at the meetings!)
TURBO: You do realize we just did a M*A*S*H joke?
(AUTHOR: It's a great show.)

she needed to be home or her mom would be mad and beat her.

[[[WARNING! WARNING! THIS FIC IS OUT OF CHARACTER! REPEAT: THIS FIC IS OUT
OF CHARACTER!]]]

LENA: No shit, Sherlock.
RELENA: Author, she's funny, can she stay?
(AUTHOR: Maybe...)

As she walked she noticed that her friend misao was crying softly, her cute
unformed breasts

TROWA: Child porn... bad.
TURBO: Trowa, you'll learn that that doesn't matter to some authors.

her poking out of her shirt in an inviting fashion. Sammy felt her virgin
pussy tighin and contract,

WASHU: It's like she having a baby.
LENA: What is she? The virgin princess?
RELENA: Ahem.
LENA: Sorry, forgot you are a princess.
RELENA/TURBO: Not by choice.
TROWA: They do this often?
WASHU: Too often sometimes...

this was getting her very hot.

JOK: TURN DOWN THE HEAT!

She skipped over to the crying girl and put her arms around her.

RELENA(Misao): Gack! Sammy... you're... crushing... me!

Misao looked up with tearful eyes and began to mumble.

"I tried to be good.."

TURBO: When women go wrong, men go right after them.
TROWA: ...

Misao cried out in saddness. "He said that I was great last time, but I
wasn't good this time."

"Who?" Sammy asked with great concern in her eyes.

LENA(Misao): The pimp on the corner of Heartache and Gone.
TURBO: Obscure classic country reference, I like it.

"Extreme, he says that I wasn't as good this time." She shook her head and
looked towards the floor. She then thought of something and grinned at her
friend.

ALL: EVIL!

"I know, how about you come with me and help me out!"

"I don't know, I mean I don't want to cheat on Cycracks..

RELENA: He's racking them up.

but oh well, He hasn't been satisfying my underaged pussy lately anyway,

TROWA: Why would you be having sex anyway?
JOK: This is a lemon, logic is futile.

I've had to resort to Tsunami for the last few days. And she can sure be a
bitch sometimes.

WASHU: But my sister is a tree, not a dog!
*Rimshot*

Sammy lick my cunt, sammy use your whips, Sammy ram it up my ass!" She
raised her hands up in indignation. "Hell she even brought out one of her
branches and told me to suck it! Disgusting!" Sammy thought about this
situation and continued. "But if he says "Extreme transformation"

TURBO: What's wrong with transformations?

or anything like that. I'm kicking his ass."

--------------------D *splat splat*

Sammy and Misao reached her home

WASHU: WHICH one's home?

shortly afterwards, the open beer cans and used condom trails could lead
them hear anyday.

JOK: City sanitation must not be good.
TURBO: With all the alien, giant robot, and monster attacks it usually is.

They walked up to the door and began to open it when they heard some moans
from the inside. They opened the door silently and peaked inside. What they
saw was disturbing.

WASHU: They saw Serio and Haruna.
ALL: BAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!

"Oh Extreme your so great!" A man with sunglasses yelled out as he gripped
his throbbing tool

JOK: Next on the Home Shopping Network: A combination vibrator/hammer!

"Your ass is just so tasty and EXTREME!" The man being pounded looked up
towards him and winked.

TROWA: Out of existence.
TURBO: Ladies, Gentlemen, and Jok...
JOK: HEY!
TURBO:...We have found our dark MSTer.

"Your not so bad yourself ZeroCool."

RELENA: He is a zero on the cool meter.

He twised over and frenched the man deeply. " Pound me with that big fat
tool of yours. And after that shove that lifesaver up my anus too!"

LENA: Guess when you gotta have it, you gotta have it.

The two girls visibly blanched and shut the door quietly.

JOK: I'd have slammed the door and bolted.

"That was disturbing."

LENA: No duh, Dick Tracy!

Sammy spoke as Misao shook her head in agreement. As they left they could
have sworn they heard somebody yell out "Extream Transformation!"

JOK: Should we?
TURBO: Why not?
JOK(Optimus Prime): OPTIMUS PRIME!
TURBO(Ultra Magnus): ULTRA MAGNUS!
JOK/TURBO(Prime/Magnus): MERGE TO FORM OMEGA PRIME!!!

------------------------D *squuuuirrrrrrrt*

Sammy and Misao shook their heads as they headed up to the large and
mysterious mansion.

RELENA: DON'T GO IN THERE!!!

They wondered outloud why they would go to such a weird place but they just
shrugged it off. They opened the door to the mansion and walked inside,
closing the door silently and tiptoeing inside. Just as they were about to
reach the kitchen a bizarre site befell them.

WASHU: A holy light, whisking them away to a land where evil fanfic authors
don't exist.

A strangely dressed man came running out of the kitchen and was tackled by a
crazy guy in a tutu.

"You will be the one to carry my unborn child!"

TURBO: Get a rabbit.
OTHERS: ???
TURBO: M*A*S*H joke.

The man yelled out maniacly as he ripped off the old guys pants. He then
twisted the guy over and shoved his shriveld old cock right inside his butt,
cutting it up and making blood splurt everywhere, including onto the two
little girls.

ALL: BAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!

A bizare Idea
overcame the girls, one which they couldn't will against. Sudddenly they
latched onto each other

JOK: AHHHH! They've become the Facehugger Aliens!

and began licking the blood from their respective bodies.

TROWA: No, vampires.
WASHU: Show some emotion, dammit!

After they were done, their minds returned to normal and they ran towards
the bathroom passing by a strange room with a couple of weird people.

RELENA: And this is odd?
WASHU: No, not really. Strange people are a constant in some animes.

"Please, Tenchi help!" Sakuya

TURBO: ShIn TeNcHi! No! IbEr!
RELENA: Turbo, calm down!
LENA: What's Iber?
JOK: Evil, It's a joke of Turbo's.

yelled out as a demonic beast began ripping off her titties.

*The females cross their arms over their chests and the males vomit.*

Blood splurted from her mouth and she ejactulated right there.

LENA(Sick): I'm sorry, I just don't see anything arousing about that scene.
TURBO(Muttering, sick): That's because Bit isn't in it.
LENA(Angry): WHAT DID YOU SAY!?!
*Lena smashes Turbo over the head with a mallet.*
TURBO: Nooot agaaaain.

The monster ripped off one of her legs and began to knaw on it like a piece
of chicken.

JOK(Ed): But I like chickens, Eddy.

As the unfortunate lady

TURBO: She's about as ‘ladylike' as a piston.
LENA: What?
WASHU(Professor mode): A Freudian interpretation says that a piston is about
as un-female as you can get.

began hyperventalating and cried until she loss the ability to cry anymore.

RELENA: Turbo, did you cast a silence spell on her?
TURBO(Hiding Seal materia): Who, me?

The monster licked the bone clean and tossed it aside. And then opened it's
eyes and shoved a large metal knife up her pussy, making jut all the way up
to her mouth.

TURBO: I think you meant a sword, not a knife.

Sakuya wiggled and flapped her arms

WASHU: Fly, wretch, FLY!!!

for a moment and then blood exploded from her and splashed all on the ground
and onto the monster, with a grin it licked it's teeth and continued eating
the girl from inside and out.

ALL: BAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFF!!!!

Misao and Sammy reached the bathroom in a hurry, they closed the door and
took off their clothes.

LENA(Misao): Must... wash... self... Feel.. dirty...

As Sammy gazed upon Misao's majestic body, her ass made a rumble and she
clutched it insanely.

TURBO: Drop your ass and run, girl!

Misao looked up with concern and raise an eyebrow.

JOK: Misao is becoming Spock!

"I have to take a dump."

TURBO: A dump? Why not a landfill?! HAHAHAHAHA-
*WHACK*
RELENA: Not funny.

Sammy said as she clutched the toiletseat. Misao grabbed her and shook her
head, Misao then sat down on the ground and becond for the blue haired girl
to follow. As Sammy passed over Misao, her ass exploded and shit came
splashing down, splashing all over Misao.

ALL: MEGA-BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!

Misao opened her shit overed eyes and looked towards Sammy, she then grinned
and licked her fingers. Sammy smiled gratefully and then put her clothes on,
she passed over misao and frenched her gratefully. As they passed by they
again passed by the same room only there was a different person in it this
time.

"I declare! Lord Tenchi..Help me!!"

WASHU: That tells us who it is.
TURBO: Aeka.

A purple haired girl asked as the demon walked up to the woman and reached
out, pulling out her eyeballs and eating them, savoring the warm squishiness
of the balls.

JOK: This would be where Tom's head would explode.

The woman screamed out to the world and lurched back. The monster licked his
fingers and walked up the woman, with a thrust he reached into her gut and
ripped out her intestines, he then set them on a platter and began to suck
them like spagetti noodles. Ayeka smashed against the floor and died
painfully, having been brutally violated by a big ugly monster.

ALL: BAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!

The two girls walked up a staircase that had conviently appeared. They
rushed towards another room and opened it up.

TROWA: Why does this happen?
JOK: We do not know.

{This scene is specifically for you Shorin}
ALL: DAMN YOU SHORIN!!!

"Oh! Ryo-Ohki, your so spectacular!"

ALL: BAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-*Trowa, Jok, and Washu faint
from loss of bile.*
TURBO: Looks like it's just You, me, and Lena, Relena.
RELENA: Why does it always wind up with just three MSTers?

Tenchi yelled out as he clutched the small furball and rammed his penis
inside her, illiciting a pained myia and a crumpled moan. "Yes, So soft and
warm!"

ALL REMAINING: BAAAAAAARRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFF!!!

He held her up and began using her to jack himself off."

LENA: Where's the other "?
RELENA: On a date with the missing period?

The two girls quickly shut the door just before they heard a horrible
tearing sound.

TURBO: Now, is that Ryo-Ohki or Tenchi?
LENA: Who cares? It's still sickening!

"Oh well, I'll just use your eye socket now!"

LENA: Is Turbo psychic?
RELENA: No. Why?
LENA: He mentioned Tenchi on a Plate of Sashimi earlier and now it's taking
place.
RELENA: He's... Well, as he says, he's just insane.
LENA: He's nuts?
TURBO: Not really, it just keeps things interesting.

Her yelled out as a nasty squishing sound was heard.

"Let's get out of here!" Sammy screamed out in terror as she turned around
towards Misao, only there was someone else there instead.

LENA: Pixy Misa.
RELENA: Ryoko.
TURBO: A tentacle rape monster.
GIRLS: You win.

"We still have so much to do." Kagato

LENA: It's actually WORSE than what Turbo thought.
RELENA: Scary.

spoke as he shifted his arm and the room began to change. Suddenly she was
strapped to a table and various instruments,knives and various poking
instruments lined the table thoroughly.

TURBO: This would be the part from Kagato's Revenge.
LENA: And that is?
TURBO: A dark/rape/bondage/torture lemon involving Sasami.

He smirked and picked up a rather large and viscious poker. "Let's begin" He
spoke as he shove the horrid utensil inside her anus,

TURBO: That's fucked up right there!

practacly fucking her with it as he shoved it in and out, bringing blood and
shit down onto the table as he pushed inward.

ALL REMAINING: BAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!

With a sigh he took it out and grabbed a large knife.

RELENA: Tormentor, impale thyself.
TURBO: Nice paraphrase.
RELENA(blushing): Thanks!
LENA(thinking): Is this how everyone sees me and Bit?
(AUTHOR[to Lena]: As a fan of Zoids Zero, yes, we do see it that way.)

He grabbed ahold of it and lowered it onto her back, then with a quick swipe
he cut off a piece of her flesh and smiled. She screamed out in agony as her
flesh was sliced from her, leaving blood trails all over her body. He looked
at the piece of flesh and opened his mouth.

LENA: He wouldn't!
TURBO: With a sick author writing this?
RELENA: Oh yes he would!

With a quick laugh he tossed the meat into his mouth and swallowed. "Tastes
like chicken"

TURBO(Mouse[From The Matrix]): Maybe they didn't know what chicken tastes
like. Maybe that's why everything tastes like chicken.
RELENA(Mouse[From ReBoot]): Sugah, I don't exactly like viruses, but I'm
being well paid for this.
*Turbo and Relena give each other a high-five.*
LENA: I don't get it.

"Noooooo!!!!!!!!" Sammy screamed out in pain as he stood over her and opened
up his pants. He then proceeded to violate her in her ass,

TURBO: Stop raping her donkey!!!
LENA: TURBO!!!

pussy

RELENA: Now you're raping her CAT!?!?
TURBO/LENA(Shocked): RELENA!?!
RELENA(Angelic): What?

and mouth. Wet squishiness and bloodynees, a few hours later she woke up.
Kagato stood over her grinning. Without warning her brought out his sword
and sliced her head clean off.

TURBO: Final Fantasy 7: The AniMovie. Starring Kagato as Sephiroth.

As the head rolled to the ground, he glanced at the open neck spot and
licked his lips. Kagato reached near the body and began sucking the blood
from the open wound.

ALL REMAINING: BAAAAAARRRRRFFFFFF!!!!!

THE END

ALL: PRAISE BE!!!

....for now

ALL: Noooooooooo!!!!!!!!!

Kagato's Testacle..............bringing disgusting to new heights.

TURBO: Yes, you are.
[fic ends]
[Turbo, Relena, and Lena exit the theater.]

Turbo just walked out of the room without speaking. Relena on the other hand
turned to Lena.

"If you want to stick around, just find an empty room and have Hoag
transport your stuff from the Toros Base."

"Thanks, this was a different experience. I think I'll just head for bed."
Lena replied.

"Same here."

Relena walked out of the room and took the turbolift to her quarters. When
she entered her room, she found a picture of her, taken when Heero tore up
her invitation, in a white frame with a white mat. When she turned it over
there was a short poem.

--I see the old moon softly rest,
--Within the new moon's rays,
--Cradled thus within my heart,
--Visions of your lovely face.

She looked up from the picture toward the door, "Turbo...?"
______________________________________________________________________________
Ooooh! Is romance abloom on the Anime Star? The first three lines of the
poem on the back of Relena's picture are from "Thirty-five" by... Well I
can't remember who wrote it, it was in my American Literature book. As
always, flames, thanks, comments, and criticism at turbomagnus@excite.com.
