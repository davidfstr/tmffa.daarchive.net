Misa, Ayeka, Brian, Pikachu, and Goku walk reluctantly
into the theater  Taking their seats, they wait for the show.
Bob watches from the control booth.

Ayeka:  Explain to me why we are doing this?
Brian:  You’ll see.
Goku:  Oh!  I like surprises!
The others look at him nervously.
Misa:  This will be different.
Pikachu:  Pika?

>Warriors of Magic

>By K'thardin

Brian:  I’m already scared.
Ayeka:  Oh, shush.  He’s not that bad.
Brian:  No.  I guess he’s not.
Misa:  Isn’t this the second chapter though?
What happened to the first?
Bob:  It wasn’t bad enough to need a review.
Pikachu:  Pika!  Pika!

Misa:  Whatever that was.
Brian:  Wait a minute!  NEXT CHAPTER!?
Ayeka:  We should prepare for a return.
All:  NOO!!!
Pikachu:  PIKA!!!!

>^_^

Brian:  Sure.  Get a kick out of our misery!

>Crisis of the Warriors

Ayeka:  How about Crisis of the MSTers?
Goku:  Why did you want me here again?
Brian:  If it gets bad enough, I’ll want someone to blast the screen.
Goku:  Cool!
Pikachu:  Pika!

<Opening Theme: Please Don’t Go - KWS>

Misa:  Never heard of ‘em.
Brian:  Kenny Wayne Sheppard?
Misa:  Oh.

>    "And for our last order of business...the Sensei-Master of
>the Dragon-Kaiyo Warrior Mage Form,

Goku:  Kaiyo?  As in  Kaiyo-ken?
Brian:  Wouldn’t doubt it.

>requests an audience of the
>One Hundred and One Priests, the Queen elect of Juraihelm,
>Tsunami; and the second in line, Ramia."

Ayeka:  Weren’t there 108 originally?
Misa:  I think so.
Brian:  Mark it down as the first mistake!
Goku:  Okay!  <Blasts a tally into the wall.>

>    As the sound of the priests booming voice finished echoing
>to the furthest reaches of the Great Hall of marble and gold, the
>doors to it's entrance swung wide, to grant entrance to the
>Sensei-Master.  For a long few seconds, only the luke warm wind

Misa:  I wonder who it is?
Brian:  I bet I can guess...
Pikachu:  Pika?

>from the outside blew into cathedral, purging the air of it's
>stuffy and stagnant quality.
>    Tsunami took this time to breath in the air, enjoying its
>quality of life and motion while she flashed a sultry glance at
>her second in command and aide in the state of affairs of
>Juraihelm, Ramia.
>    Ramia almost flinched in response,

Brian:  What ran up her skirt?
Misa:  Probably the story.
Brian:  Good point!

>before leveling a sidelong glare that told Tsunami not only no, but HELL NO
>in regards to her most recent pass.

Misa:  Now, I’m curious.
Ayeka:  As am I.
Pikachu:  Pika-chu

>Tsunami sighed, wishing that Ramia wasn't such a prude concerning such
>things.  It >wasn't like  Ramia wouldn't enjoy it...Tsunami was certain
>that she could make it an experience that her long time friend would never
>forget,  and even...want more of.

All:  OH NO!
Misa:  She’s a...
Ayeka:  I cannot believe that Tsunami is a...
Brian:  K’THARDIN!  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!
Pikachu:  PIIIKA!!!
Bob:  This is bad.  Very bad.
Goku:  What?  What’s wrong?
Misa:  K’thardin thinks that Tsunami likes girls.
Goku:  Yeah.  So?  There’s no reason to dislike girls.
Brian:  She means Tsunami REALLY likes girls as in...
Goku:  Oh...  I didn’t think she was like that.
Pikachu:  Pika pika...

>And ohhh...the things she would do with that gorgeous body Ramia sported to
>satisfy her own appetites. She would take her again and again and...

Brian:  <Takes out paper bag and places his already
digested lunch into it.>

>    Her daydream abruptly ended when a small drake flew inside
>the Great Hall slowly.  Using the blue tiles as his guide, the
>dragon flew in near slow motion toward the slightly raised dais.

Brian:  I knew it.
All:  Who?
Brian:  You’ll find out.

>He hovered above it for a short time, then settled himself down
>upon it.  His form then began to glow and change to a liquid
>incandescent energy, which grew and reshaped itself.  A man's
>outline began to emerge from nebulous mass of power, a man's
>kneeling outline.  A span of time, that could only be measured in
>a few grains of sand falling from an hour glass, and it had grown
>more defined. He had white hair, and a white beard; black upon
>black clothing, green piercing eyes admist a very sour scowl, and
>general bad attitude about the whole situation.

Misa:  Oh, no...
Ayeka:  Him?
Brian:  Yup...
Pikachu:  Pika?
Goku:  Who is it?

>   He didn't look like he had any intention of moving from his
>place either.
>    "Anata."  Tsunami said softly and happily.  Another of her
>oldest and dearest friends...so old and dear that she'd taken to
>calling him by the term of affection reserved for only those
>closest to the heart.

Misa:  <a bit bored>  Figures.  He and Tsunami.
Pikachu:  Pika....

>"What can we do for you, dearest Anata?"
>It was also a term used between lovers and spouses.

Ayeka:  That man bothers me.
Brian:  Why?
Ayeka:  Why would Tsunami and him be together?
Goku:  Why?  What’s wrong?
Misa:  When you’re free from this horrifying fic,
read Heaven and Eternity.

>    The man visibly winced, because it was that much worse with
>her...the capitalization of the pronoun was very real to her.  He

Misa:  He doesn’t like that term?
Ayeka:  This is new.
Pikachu:  Pika!

>trembled as he drew to full height.  Not a very impressive
>height, even Tsunami was taller than he.

Ayeka:  <snicker>  As are many others.
Goku:  He is kinda short, isn’t he?
Bob:  I’ve seen worse.

>Yet still could you tell that great power radiated from him
>    Despite his power, he looked on the verge of tears before
>the sour expression replaced itself on his face.

Misa:  <sarcasm>  I wonder what’s wrong with him.
Goku:  Beats me.
The others look at him nervously.
Brian:  Goku, it’s Tsunami’s gender preference that bothers him.
Goku:  Oh.

>    "I have come," he growled, "to once again ask for my two
>students to be released from their service here...so I may take
>them back to the deserts of Ryoken and complete their training.
>I have come to ask for Ryo-ohki and Rumia."

Brian:  First Tenchi, now these two.  All he does is train others.
Ayeka:  Very predictable, to say the least.
Misa:  NO kidding.
Pikachu:  Pika!

>    "Impossible.  You know this, Sensei-Master Cyraqs."  The
>one, dressed more ornately than the others, stated almost before
>the words were out of Cyraqs' mouth.  The hight priest himself.
>    "They were taken during a very critical time.  Just
>beginning to discover their real powers.  You risk one of the 101
>schools of Kaiyo by not allowing me to complete their training.
>Should I die..."

Brian:  Nah.  Too easy.
Misa:  Then I’ll say it:  “All will rejoice!”
Ayeka:  You don’t like him?
Misa:  Not much.
Pikachu:  Pika?
Misa:  I have my reasons.

>    "You know the Magical Realm is also in a period of
>transition.  Your two students have been called back to be used
>by the queen elect Tsunami and the second in line Ramia for this
>purpose.  You have asked this one time every six months for the
>past three years.  You KNOW THIS!"

Brian:  Go away!  Shoo!
Pikachu:  Pika...
Misa:  That was a bit lame...

>    Cyraqs' face tightened.  "Please..."
>    "No.  The decision is final."  The priest pounded his staff
>on the floor to signify the matter closed.
>    Tsunami's sensitive heart nearly broke as she felt the pain
>come from he who was again kneeling on the floor.  Every time he
>asked...this happened, but even she knew the necessity.  She
>found that during this time there was no way she could have
>existed without the aid Ryo-ohki provided, and she knew Ramia
>could not possibly function without her kid brother.  Perhaps in
>a couple of years, when she was queen...
>    But as she saw him get up, will his walking staff into
>existence, and turn to walk back the way he had come in defeat
>once again; she wasn't really sure he would be able to handle two
>more years.
>    She hadn't seen much of him for the last ten or so years,

Ayeka: <sarcasm> Gee, I wonder why?
Misa:  I dunno.  Maybe Cyraqs has been hiding.
Pikachu:  Pika!

>not since...not since he had left to 'carry on...' as he had
>cryptically told her.  If only she could figure out a way to help
>him.  She couldn't even allow Cyraqs to see Ryo-ohki, he was on
>another world with the magical girl.  As for Rumia, she knew
>Ramia had him running almost non-stop errands to the far reaches
>of this and many other worlds.

Misa:  All this time, and she still hasn’t figured it out.
Goku:  Figured out what?
Pikachu:  Pika?
Brian:  Ramia is against Tsunami.
Goku:  But, Tsunami likes her.
Brian:  Ramia hid her tracks well.
Goku:  Ah!  I see!

>There had to be some way to help
>him.  She was definitely going to have to talk to Oyuki tonight
>about that.  After certain pleasantries of course.

Brian:  With whom, I wonder?
Misa:  Do you REALLY want to know that answer?
Brian:  Not really.

>    She smiled languorously when she imagined the prospect.  Oh
>she was going to enjoy that.

Brian:  This is making me sick...
Pikachu:  Pika! <pats Brian’s head sympathetically>

>    Cyraqs found himself brooding in the courtyard, sitting
>down on the outskirts of a fountain, his staff on top of knees.
>    Anata...damn Bitch still calls me that.

Misa:  That’s no way to talk about her.
Ayeka:  Why did he capitalize that word?
Goku:  Beats me.
Brian:  Unless that’s his name for her.
Goku:  That’s not very nice!
Pikachu:  Pika pika!

>A tear fell from his eye, and began the trek down his cheek.  Still...I'm
>gone for most of ten years, and she still...damn you.

Goku:  He sure has a dirty mouth.
Brian:  This is nothing.  He’s much worse in H&E.
Ayeka&Misa:  Oh yes!
Pikachu:  Pikapi!
Ayeka:  Then, there’s JL.
Brian:  I’m not going there.  For fear of whipping, I will NOT go there.
Ayeka:  By JL?
Brian:  No, by YOU!

>   And you won't give me the only thing that's been any source
>of joy to me since I saw that I could not ever be anything you
>would want.   Damn that I cannot hate you for taking it all from
>me.

Brian:  Cannot hate her?  I didn’t think he had any feelings for her.
Misa:  There’s more than meets the eye.

>    Enough Cyraqs!  That is not the reason...you know why!  You
>NEED to train those boys!  There is a reason that their training
>must be completed...the same fucking reason that the kingdom is
>in this crisis!  The same reason there is no ruler now!  The same
>reason they have had to train and test these new ones!  They
>could come...I could die!  Without a second generation, we will
>die!  There must be a way.
>    Shrugging inwardly he made a decision.

Brian:  Don’t hurt yourself.
Ayeka:  That was harsh.
Pikachu:  Pikachu!

>    If they will not give them to me...I will go to them.  One
>way or the other, I will finish it.

All:  KIDNAPPING!

>    Cyraqs dreaded what he was about to do, standing outside of
>this door...he truly did not want to talk to her.  But she was
>one who had one of his students under service.  It was going to
>be far easier to talk to her than to talk to the other one.
>    "Shit...this one's only going to be abusive while she
>offers to jump my bones.

Goku:  Is this fic safe for kids?
Brian:  No.  I don’t think so.
Misa:  Is this a lemon?
Brian:  What is this?  Jeopardy?  No, it’s not a lemon.
Comes close, though.
Ayeka:  That had better not have a double meaning.

>What could be so problematic about
>that?  I mean the other one's only going to rip my heart out and
>stomp on it a couple of times."  He quipped to himself bitterly.
>He tapped on the ornate door, then casually shattered it.

Misa:  A bit brittle is it?
Ayeka:  Just a bit.
Pikachu:  Pika...

>    "Something the matter Master Cyraqs?"  Ramia asked, not in
>the least perterbed about her door losing physical cohesion.

Brian:  I bet she’ll casually blow his head off.
Others give angry glares
All:  Brian!
Pikachu:  Pika!!!!  <lightning starting to arc>
Brian:  I meant with a GUN!  Sheesh...

>   Cyraqs closed the distance between himself and Ramia as she
>worked diligently at her desk on some piece of paperwork or
>whatnot, not even bothering to look at him.  Without further ado,
>and as politely as possible (if such an act can be done politely)
>he pulled the pen and paper from her hands and set it aside, then
>casually tossed the desk into the nearest wall.

Misa:  Been here done that?
Ayeka:  Probably.
Goku:  They sure are destroying a lot.

>    Her eyes twinkled as she looked up and met his.  A half
>mile formed on her lips when she asked, "Are you quite done?"

Misa: (Cyraqs)  Nah.  There’s a whole world out there to demolish.

>   He said nothing for a moment, before his rough voice
>finally spoke, "It occurs to me that the only reason that the
>priests would say such a thing to me for the past three years is
>if he had orders from those that held their service that any such
>notion could not be entertained...no matter what."
>    "Oh did you just NOW figure this out?"

Ayeka:  He did have trouble seeing the obvious before.
Misa:  Tsunami was pouring out her heart, and he was as clueless as Goku.
Goku:  Hey!
Misa:  No offense, but it’s true.  How many people did you mistake for
King Kai?
Goku:  Only a few.
Misa:  One of them was a woman, one was an ogre, and one was a chimp.
Pikachu:  Pika pika pi!

>   He ignored the sarcasm, for the moment.  "You risk one of
>the warrior mage schools by doing this!"
>    She put her hands on her head, affecting a faint.  "Oh
>forgive me Oh Wise and Powerful Master!  I didn't know the need
>was so pressing that we couldn't put it off for a few years while
>we correct a slight problem concerning the very HEART of our
>beloved Juraiheeeepp!"

Misa:  It will be if she gets control.

>    For such a small guy, he was incredibly strong she noted as
>he pulled her from her chair and threw her on the nearest wall,
>and pinned her there.  But then she had always known how powerful
>he was.
>    He didn't hurt me a bit when he did that, she thought
>happily.  Oh you try to be all mean and menacing, but you just
>can't do it right, can you?
>    "If I thought for a second that was your concern I wouldn't
>be playing this game, like I have with the damn 101 priests who I
>KNOW really think that way!"

Brian:  101 people after her.  THAT’S scary!
Ayeka:  Not as scary as this fic!
Pikachu:  Pi-ka!

>    And you still must feel something for me, she said to
>herself when she noticed his body had pressed itself up against
>her very gently.

Brian:  A lemon scene?
Pikachu:  <covers eyes>  Pika....
Ayeka:  I hope it’s better than that other Sammy lemon.
Misa:  Anything would be.
Goku:  Is there something I’m missing?  What does fruit have to do with it?
Brian:  Internet wise, lemon means sex.
Goku:  You mean they’re married?
Others:  I don’t think so!
Bob:  How BASIC is this guy?
Pikachu:  Pikachu!

>You're still seriously messed up, aren't you?

All:  Yes, she is.

>    She put her arms around him gently; in counter point to the
>tone of her voice as she said, "Don't think for a SECOND that I
>don't love my world too!  Tsunami is too soft...too weak to
>rule!"  Her face softened and she began to caress him sensually.
>"She's not even a real woman.  C'mon...throw away your feelings
>for her.  I can ease your pain...make you forget all about her,
>like I did those ten years ago when you first found out what she
>was.  When you saw her and the Lady Yui kissing in the..."

Misa:  What makes K’thardin think that she’s a lesbian anyways?
Brian:  I shudder to think what the answer might be.
Ayeka:  You know, don’t you?
Brian:  As a matter of fact, I do.  He said it was mainly because of
OVA 2 of the Sammy series.
Others think back.
Misa:  Sorry, you lost me.
Ayeka:  As well as I.
Brian:  You think YOU’RE lost?  That OVA had little evidence to
support his theory.
Pikachu:  <pointing to the screen>  Pika!  Pika!

>He let her go, and she landed on buttock's with an, "oof!"
>    "That was a mistake I made a very long time ago.  One I
>have no intention of repeating."  He told her hotly.  He walked
>to the opposite wall and leaned against it.  "Now, where is
>Rumia?"
>    She pulled herself into a kneeling position, head bowed in
>supplication, and hands before her.  A near prefect imitation of
>the same way Tsunami sat down, were it not for the mocking smile
>on her face.  "What if I don't tell you?  Will you tie me up and
>whip me?  Hmmm?"

Ayeka:  <grins>  I could help...  That red haired one needs torture.
Brian:  Now, I’m REALLY scared.

>    Green energy crackled around him for split second before he
>answered.  "Yeah sure...tie you up and deliver you gift wrapped
>to Tsunami.  I'm sure she could find all sorts of uses for you."

Goku:  He sure is mean.
Brian:  When it comes to Ramia, wouldn’t doubt it.

>    Ramia lowered her head even more, letting her hair cover
>the brief flash of disgust that had come over her.  The thought
>of having that...thing touching her repulsed her right down to
>the core of her very being.  No matter how much she told her
>'friend' that she was not that way, Tsunami still tried to
>convince Ramia to share her bed.

Pikachu:  Pika? <electricity arcs>
Brian:  Not yet, Pikachu.

>His insult then would have been
>one of the deadliest sort...had he not said it with as much
>bitterness and self loathing as he did.
>    Poor bastard still loves her, she thought in both pleasure
>and jealousy.  Indeed you are messed up...my love.
>    Another thing that Tsunami had that she did not.  His love.
>Even though Tsunami had neither knowledge of it...nor would have
>any clue what to do with it if she did.  Ramia just didn't get
>it.
>    She was smarter!  Stronger!  Better looking!  A real woman!

Misa:  And a real pain in the ass!  No wonder she’s not a queen!
Ayeka:  Business before pleasure?
Misa:  Or both mixed together?
Brian:  Why not?  Works everywhere else.
Goku:  What does?
Brian:  <a little irritated>  She sleeps with others to get higher up!
Goku:  She must be well rested, then.
Others:  Not a chance!

>Yet every single time it seemed that Tsunami was just one step
>ahead of her.  She had gained everything that Ramia could not.

Misa:  Tsunami got to them first.
Brian:  Most likely.  Would explain why Ramia is number two.

>How had she done it?  Hell...she'd even gained the love of the
>man that they had grown up with.
>    That wasn't supposed to happen!  I love him!  He was
>supposed to be with me! She raged.  He had been mine!  She
>remembered the month she had spent in his arms, giving him the
>comfort and love that Tsunami would never be able to.  That was
>when he had finally found out about Tsunami...when he had caught
>Tsunami passionately kissing Yui in Tsunami's private quarters.

Brian:  <loses lunch once again>  I’m getting sick of that reference.
Pikachu:  Pika pika....

>And Tsunami, poor clueless Tsunami, was probably still trying to
>figure out why he was gone for most of ten years...even before he
>started training his students.
>    Then one day he had rose from the bed he and Ramia shared.
>A look of...pain on his face, and all she could see was that he
>realized he had betrayed his feelings for Tsunami, by giving them
>to another woman, however briefly.  Without a word he had
>left...and Ramia's relationship to him had been thusly, ever
>since.

Ayeka:  That man needs help.
Misa:  That man needs a brain.
Brian:  -ing.
Pikachu:  <snickering>  Pika pika!

>    "She doesn't deserve you."  Ramia told him.  "She doesn't
>even want you.  We both know whose gorgeous bod she's REALLY hot
>for."

Brian:  Unfortunately for her.

>    "Rumia.  Where?" he replied emotionlessly.
>    "No."
>    He then sat up straight, and walked out of the room.  At
>the doorway he turned to look back at her, as she was still
>kneeling.  "Her tongue would freeze."

Goku:  What did that mean?
Brian:  Beats the hell out of me.

>    The satisfying sound of an enraged shriek and a desk
>crashing from behind, followed him on his way down the hallway.

Misa:  A little pissed off?
Ayeka:  Just a little.

>    He grinned.  She hasn't changed a bit.  Then he grimaced.
>Too bad she lets her darkness poison her soul.

Brian:  And the Tsunami factor doesn’t help much, does it?
Misa:  No, it doesn’t.
Ayeka:  A few years of therapy might help...
Brian:  It might help everyone.
All:  NAH!!

>    Ryo-ohki's claws raked across Rumia's face, as Ramia's
>counter spinning kick nailed Ryo-ohki's upper jaw, splitting his
>lip on one of his own fangs.

Goku:  Oh!  A fight!  I love a good fight!

>Both pulled back, and circled each
>other wearily, hardly seeming to be aware of their injuries, as
>the blood leaked from their faces, staining the clothing they
>wore.
>    They closed, locking forearms, then with a quick flurry of
>blows, pulled back again.
>    He's stronger, they thought simultaneously.  Much stronger
>than before.  I cannot hold back any longer.

Misa:  Then don’t!  Don’t hold back!

>    Ryo-ohki pressed his attack again, feral and fierce
>movements of a cat, pitting itself against the control and grace
>of a bird.  Each countering and attacking with the same will as
>their spirit animal.  Ryo-ohki stronger, Rumia faster; and each
>highly skilled.

Ayeka:  Cats and birds are natural enemies.
Misa:  But, Ryo-Ohki is more than a cat.
Goku:  Then, what is he?
Brian:  Part cat, part rabbit.  Commonly called a cabbit.
Goku:  Cool!

>    Ryo-ohki, realizing this fight was not going to be one this
>way managed to push Rumia away, and full on punch into Rumia's
>hastily raised cross block, sending him back a few feet.
>    Ryo-ohki knew he couldn't let Rumia get back up, so placing
>his hands at his side he began a spell...suffused with his ki
>energies, and unleashed it with golden devastating force upon his
>opponent.  It impacted nothing but the wall and a few garbage
>cans as Rumia managed to recover in time and leapt into the
>air...letting his animal spirit overcome him.  Changing him to
>look more avian...less human.

Brian:  Oh, the humanity...Wait, that’s gone, isn’t it?
Misa:  Ba-ad joke.
Pikachu:  Pika....

>    "So then..."  Ryo-ohki said needlessly.  He too let his
>spirit overtake him, his cat force streamlined his features, his
>face and body becoming more feline.
>    Each began another death spell.  Despite the fact that they
>had both grown stronger, it was a fight Ryo-ohki knew that Rumia
>had no hope of winning.  This fight was pure strength, pure
>animalistic hunger that consumed all in it's path, and he was
>always stronger.  His friend was handing him victory.
>    Damn, those that made it have to be this way.
>    With a wordless scream, each thrust their hands before them
>and focused his power at the other, literally tearing loose from
>their bodies.  The scream was soon drowned out by the roar of the
>explosion as their two powers met in midair, struggling to
>overcome the other, fueled by the wills of the two warrior mages.
>Locked in this battle of wills, neither could turn from the
>other...not even as the golden power ate the purple, and struck
>the bird with a thunderous force.

Brian:  Battle’s over.  Good triumphs.  Goodnight!  <gets up>
Pikachu:  Pika!  <zaps him>
Brian: (charred)  O-kay.  I’ll stay.

>    Misao struggled against something in her sleep.  She could
>see in her dreams, a great battle being fought.  A boy...the one
>she saw before...the one that helped her, was fighting for his
>life against another.  Each began trading blows of the kind she
>had never even seen, much less conceived of.  Soon they began to
>change, each becoming stronger, more inhuman.

Misa:  This fic is inhumane!
Ayeka:  I agree.
Pikachu:  Pika!

>    She tossed and turned...or at least tried to, for her body
>could not keep up the fight, yet something drove her on as she
>whimpered and gave small peeps of terror, and something else, as
>her dream kept playing itself out.
>    In it she saw the boy, the one she felt connected to, be
>beaten back by the other's tightly controlled strikes.  She could
>feel him pulling his punches.  She could feel him not dodging
>strikes, not fighting to full potential.

Goku:  Usually a good idea when fighting to do that.  But...
Misa:  But, he’s getting his ass kicked!

>    Why?  FIGHT!  Don't let him kill you! She shouted
>helplessly in the way that dreamers are sometimes helpless to
>control what they see.  Don't let him hurt you!  Please Rumia...
>    She knew his name.  She knew him as she knew herself, yet
>did not question this, the same way one does not question many of
>the things in life that one takes on faith...it's simply
>something that was known to her.
>    Instinctively she reached out tried to shield him from the
>other's blast, knowing that there was nothing she would be able
>to do as the beam of golden power shot through the air toward the
>one she wished to protect.
>    Somehow Rumia pulled up and away before it hit.  She gasped
>in both relief and terror when she saw he got away, but what he
>had become...

Ayeka:  A bird?
Misa:  A plane?

>    He had what seemed to be long and straight feathers
>protruding from his arms and leg, his hair had grown spiked and
>outward in a kind of mix between feathers and hair, and his

Brian:  A mutant!
Ayeka:  Eww...

>    Yes, she was scared at first, but only at first.  The

Brian:  Run like the wind, girl!
Misa:  You’re getting better.

Goku:  Complete set of Dragon Balls?
Bob:  OS upgrade?

Brian:  And proud of it!

>that was in the dark.  It made her worries and cares much less.
