It was another peaceful day in the Satellite of Love. Tom and Crow were
engaging in a healthy game of Doom (shareware, natch) in the HoloCabana,
while Mike slept in. 
Crow enjoyed his role as a lone trooper in a horde of demons, while Tom was
not having quite as much fun, functioning as Crow’s weapons. “Die, die,
die!” Crow yelled as he blasted demon after demon with Tom’s built in
Gatling gun attachment (patent pending). “Crow, just out of curiosity, why
do you insist on using THESE weapons?? What’s wrong with the BFG9000? I
hate being a chaingun!”
“Gee, Tom, bring it up with Mike... he’s the one who won’t spring for the
registered version..”
“You’re right! Let’s blast him!”
The bots exited the Cabana, leaving its balsa wood frame behind.
“Mike! Mike! Servo wants Duke Nukem Atomic edition!” Crow shrieked, running
into Mike’s room. 
“What? Crow, what is this? What did I say about first-person shooting games
in the holocabana?”
“That they’re bad and should never be played using Tom as an automatic
weapon... what’s your point?” Crow replied.
 “Look what you did to Tom,” Mike said, picking up the bubblegum brained
bot, whose smoking dome was currently filled to capacity with bullet
casings.
Servo was muttering something about never getting to be an energy weapon,
when the light signaling a message came on.
“Oh look, a message,” Mike said, pushing the button.

DEEP 13
“Good morning, my putrid little lab rats,” Dr. Forrester said, looking
really, really happy. “Frank is happy to see you, too.” He gestured to his
assistant, who was dutifully chewing on what appeared to be a raw side of
beef. “He’s recovered remarkably well, for being turned into a mutant
werewolf, don’t you think?”

SOL
“Sure, Dr. F. He looks great!” Mike said.
“Yeah, his coat seems pretty shiny,” Crow added.

DEEP 13
“In fact, I’m so happy, I’ll go first on this week’s invention exchange. I
have invented an infared cannon that modulates through all known
frequencies and variations so that it....”

SOL
“NO!!” all three said.

DEEP 13 
“Yes!! It opens all the garage doors in the area where it is set off, and
exposes all the lawnmowers to the elements, where they will rust horribly
and no one will be able to cut their grass!! Bwahaahahah!!” Dr. F yelled
maniacally. “In fact, I’m so happy, we’ll just skip your end of the
exchange and go directly to the day’s fic! I’m feeling merciful today, so
this will be short, but still painful, most likely. It’s called “Waiting
for Tsunami.” Enjoy!”

SOL
“Hooboy,” Tom said. “I hate it when he gets like this..”
“Really. He sends us worse fanfics, and says they’re even better than
normal,” Crow said.
“Come on, guys... this one might not be so bad...” Mike retorted.
But no further time was spent in discussion.
“We’ve got fanfic sign!!!!”

                               Waiting for Goddess
                                 by Ken Arromdee

>    Three years, thought Sasami.  The three years are almost up.  Just
another
>few days, and then...  what? 
MIKE: Yeah, when the warranty goes, you know it’s all over.
> She didn't know.  She had barely started high
>school, and now she wasn't sure if it would be her who finished out the
year.
TOM: Those contract disputes are a b****, aren’t they?
MIKE: Be nice, Tom...
>In one way, she was fifteen and a half. 
CROW: But which way do we go?
MIKE: Straight, I hope...
> Counting the time spent in cold sleep,
>a few hundred.  But Tsunami...  Tsunami was eternal.  "I hate you,
Tsunami..."
>cried Sasami.
TOM: Yes, we all hate goddesses who save our lives, don’t we?

                                  * * * * * *
CROW: Man, nothing’s worse than bullet holes in a fanfic...

>    Three years ago had been just six months after the Yuzuha incident.
TOM: Well, that was confusing. So was it 3 and a half years or 2 and three
quarters...
MIKE: Don’t nitpick, Tom, I’ll just make your head explode.

>Tenchi, in fact the whole family, had gained a new daughter, who everyone
>loved and cared for, and they were going to celebrate Christmas.  It was
just
>like Startika, but on this part of the planet it happened in the winter
>instead.
CROW: The festival of Endika, on the other hand, is celebrated on St.
Patrick’s Day.
TOM: If I survive this fanfic, I swear, I’ll dance a jig!!
>    It was just something Tenchi said when everyone was gathered together
>laughing at old pictures of themselves. 
CROW: <Tenchi> You know, I could have sex with anybody in this room right
now!
MIKE: Crow, that was really uncalled for...
TOM: But he does have a point, Mike.
> Kiyone wasn't in the fight against
>Yuzuha, so Tenchi had to explain everything to her 
TOM: <Tenchi>  Kiyone, you’re an idiot! Listen to me! I fought Yuzuha. I
won! Do you get it now?
>that happened in Yuzuha's
>world.

>    "So after we were wishing we had Tsunami",
ALL: When you wish upon a tree...
> said Tenchi, "Aeka hit on the
>idea
CROW: Hey, you’re kinda cute...
(Mike shoots him a dirty look)
CROW: What?
> of bringing a branch of the tree Funaho in.  With a presence of light,
>I got my abilities back...  and then it was over. 
TOM: (getting angry) No it wasn’t, it was a big battle! THERE WAS MUCH
FIGHTING!
MIKE: Just smile and nod...
> It was just a matter of
>time."

>    "I never thought as hard before 
CROW:...
MIKE: Don’t say it.
>as when it was something to save
>Tenchi-sama..." said Aeka, delicately taking Tenchi's hand for emphasis.
TOM: <Tenchi> Aaaagghhh! Give it back! Give it back!!
>Ryouko, not one to be outdone, hovered in the air and hugged Tenchi from
>behind.
CROW: <Butthead> Huhhuh... he said behind...
>    "But you had Tsunami", said Kiyone.  "From what you explained about
>what happened on Jurai with Sasami, you..."
TOM: Could’ve blown everything to hell!
CROW: Could’ve run away!
MIKE: Could’ve leapt tall buildings in a single bound!
Bots: O_o
MIKE: What?
>    "Aeka and I couldn't", said Yosho.  "It wasn't fair to our sister when
>we had another way. 
CROW: The back door!
MIKE: One more like that and I’ll send you to an alternate dimension!
TOM: Uhhh, Mike, did you just get censored?
MIKE: D’oh! How’d that happen?
> She needs to be a little girl still.  We couldn't just
>ask her to turn into Tsunami."
TOM: But you could TELL her to!

>    Sasami was sitting quietly, as she did more and more often these days.
CROW: It drastically cut into the time when she ran around screaming.

>She was real...  she knew it, she had to be.  Everyone had said that she
>did still exist and that Tsunami was just fusing with her.  But fusing
with
>a tree...  that was almost as bad as not existing at all. 
CROW: Yeah, really! She should at least fuse with something that can kill
stuff!
MIKE: Uh, Crow, how many stimpacks did you use while you were playing Doom?
CROW: (Foaming at the beak) Only FIVE!!!! 
> She wouldn't be
>real when it all happened.  She would just be a minor part of some great
>entity who didn't care about her family or this house or shojo manga or
>anything except whatever great entities care about.
TOM: Tonight on Geraldo- What great entities care about!
>  Tears started to flow
>from her eyes at the prospect.
MIKE: The prospect quickly dodged them.
>    "Sasami-chan?" asked Aeka.  "What's bothering you?"
TOM: <Sasami> Oh, nothing, I’m just being absorbed by a goddess, nothing to
worry about...
>    Sasami gazed at Aeka in the face, but didn't answer.
CROW: As opposed to gazing at Aeka in the..
MIKE: (leaping at Crow, supergluing his mouth shut) Time out for you, young
man!
>    "Sasami-chan?  You have to say something.
>  Is it because you're worried
>that nobody cares
TOM: <Sasami> No, it’s because I’m being absorbed by a goddess.
> about you any more since Mayuka's around?"

>    "No!  It's not that!  You wouldn't understand!" yelled Sasami.
CROW: Mmmmppththth! MMmthehrhher!
TOM: I think he wanted to comment on that...

>    Yosho, in his best aauthoritative voice, said "Calm down, Sasami. 
We're
>your family",
CROW: (Having gotten his mouth free) So, who’s your daddy?

> then indicated Tenchi and Ryouko and the others and added "And
>your friends.
TOM: And here’s a weird naked indian.
MIKE: Not bad, Servo!
>  You can tell us what's bothering you."
TOM: Not that we’ll listen, but you can tell us anyway,
>    "It's Tsunami!  Someday I'm not going to be here any more and it's
going
>to be Tsunami!"
MIKE: You know, I don’t remember Sasami having this much trouble with this
issue before.
TOM: Plot device. Smile and nod.

                                  * * * * * *
CROW: The nuclear bombs sure are pretty tonight. Oh, crap. *boom*
MIKE: How’d you do that?
CROW: I’m the missile launcher.
>    Sasami had bad dreams that night.  In her dreams
BOTS: (singing) she shows no mercy...
> she was a figure, a
>woman whose body she couldn't see,
TOM: Then how does she know it’s there, huh?

>watching over her homeworld Jurai.  There
>were millions of people on it and it was a perspective unlike anything she
>had really experienced. 
MIKE: I guess in her perspective, there were only hundreds of thousands of
people on it.
> She wanted to see what Aeka and the others were doing,
CROW: BowChickABowBow
MIKE and TOM: Cut it out, Crow!

>and tried to focus on them.  But the more she concentrated, the farther
away
>each individual got.  
TOM: Maybe she should stop trying.
>More distant and smaller, as if there was no such thing
>as individuals any more, no such thing as friends and family.  Sasami
cried out
>"Aeka!  Tenchi-oniichan!" and ran towards them, but they disappeared into
the
>distance at incredible speeds, into a dark forest full of leaves with
>pictures on them.  
TOM: So did the leaves have pictures on them  or did the forest... or
(light on top of his dome begins to swivel around)
MIKE: Calm down, we only have one spare head for you today!
>It was too late when she reached them; she and them were
>no longer of the same kind.  And when she looked at the leaves, somehow
she
>knew that among them was one named Sasami....
CROW:... because it was her!! Aaaaaahhhhggghh!! 

>    Sasami woke up in a cold sweat. 
MIKE: Better than waking up in warm...
CROW: MIKE! I’m shocked!
> She rushed out and frantically knocked
>on Tenchi's door.  She knew it was only a dream, 
TOM: Knocking on his door is a dream, but... (Dome starts to smoke)
>but seeing his face at the
>door made her feel a little better.

>    "Did you have a bad dream?" asked Tenchi? 
MIKE: I guess even Tenchi isn’t sure who he is.
> Tenchi would always comfort her
>when she did.
CROW: And there was much rejoycing/
ALL: (bored) yay.
>    "I had a very bad dream but I'm not sure it's a dream!" exclaimed
Sasami.
TOM: But she just.... Yyyyyyyeeeeeaaaaarrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! 
MIKE: Get down!!!
(Servo’s head explodes, sending bullet casings, shrapnel-like, into the
walls)
>She began explaining it to him, and he listened patiently.  "I was Tsunami
and
>I didn't really care about you or anyone else and it was just like I was
afraid
>of...  Tenchi-oniichan, what's going to happen to me when I get older?"
MIKE: (Screwing Servo’s new head back on) Calm down, ok?
>    "When you get older...  don't worry, you'll be beautiful."
CROW: Heck, I’ll even want a piece of the action!
>    "I don't care about that now!  I want to know how long I'll be me! 
Will
>you still be my Tenchi-oniichan?"
TOM: Technically, he never was... but it’s not going to bother me...
>    "Why wouldn't I...  oh, you mean after you become Tsunami?  Well, for
some
>reason I'm considered a very important person", 
MIKE: Yeah, I can’t figure it out. I mean, can’t everyone cut a spaceship
the size of the moon in half?
>said Tenchi.  "Even by
>Tsunami.  She likes me almost as much as you do, so I don't think you have
>anything to worry about."
CROW: <Tenchi> But I do! She’s a fox!

>    "But will it be Tsunami or me?"
MIKE: I don’t think Tenchi’s a pedophile, so I’ll go with Tsunami on this
one.
>    "I don't know, Sasami-chan.  We'll have to wait to see when that
comes.
CROW: (Opens beak)
MIKE: (grabs Servo and attaches Gatling gun) You say it, and you’re going
out the airlock.
>I... I don't want to upset you, Sasami-chan, I just don't understand
Tsunami
>and I'm not sure anyone does.
TOM: (bullets shoot from the dome)EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT TSUNAMI ALREADY
TOLD YOU WHAT WAS GOING ON IN OVA#9!!!
MIKE: (disconnecting the gun from Tom) You are calm. There is no bad
fanfic.
TOM: I  AM CAlm. there is no bad fanfic. Thanks Mike! (looks at screen)
Aaagh!

>    Sasami felt someone over her shoulder.  Or was it Tsunami who felt
that?
>No, her imagination's running away with her.  It had to be.  It couldn't
be
>starting already.  Then someone put a hand on her shoulder and she turned
>around to look.
TOM: <Sasami> Auiiighghghh!! Blood everywhere!

>    It was only her sister.  "Oh, oneesan.  You... you scared me a little
bit."
CROW: Ahh, admit it. You wet yourself!
>    "It looked like you were pretty scared already.  I wanted to make sure
you
>were okay", said Aeka.
MIKE: By completely freaking you out.
>    "Did you hear everything I told Tenchi-oniichan?"

>    "I heard just about all of it.  I'll tell you what, Sasami-chan.  You
get
>some sleep and tomorrow morning we can talk to Washuu-chan and ask her all
>about you and Tsunami and what's going to happen to you.  She always knows
>something about whatever problem we're having around the house."
MIKE: Usually because she CAUSES most of the problems around the house.

>    "Do you promise?"
CROW: <Aeka> If I’m lying, I will seduce Tenchi by any means possible!
>    Sasami was just scared, thought Aeka.  Besides, Washuu had to be able
to
>say something to help calm her fears.  "Hai, Sasami-chan, I promise."

>    "Okay...  I'll go back to sleep."
MIKE: But first, a musical interlude!!
(Mike and the bots jump around the inside of the theater for a few seconds)
                                  * * * * * *
TOM: Well, I can’t think of anything...
>    Most of the time Sasami ended up making breakfast, since she and
Washuu
>were the best cooks and Washuu considered cooking boring.  This morning,
>however, Sasami left the eggs too raw.  That wasn't a serious mistake
CROW: Except for the salmonella poisoning.
> compared
>to the damage someone like Ryouko could do to a dish of food,
TOM: It’s not her fault, she can’t really tell the difference between
flavors, it’s how she was built!
CROW: You are such a fanboy.
TOM: Otaku, you chromedomed twit.
MIKE: Cut it out. 
> but it was
>obvious to most of her extended family that she had something on her mind.
TOM: <all in kitchen> Oh my GOD, it’s a tumor!
CROW: <Arnold> It’s natta tumoah.

>    "Needs a little more thermal protein denaturization", said Washuu.

>    "What?" replied Sasami.
ALL: She said, “IT NEEDS A LITTLE MORE THERMAL PROTEIN DENATURIZATION!”
>    "It means that you didn't cook the eggs long enough.  Is something
>bothering you?"
TOM: <Sasami> Why does everyone keep asking me this?
>    "Yes, it's--" said Sasami, but was interrupted by her sister's hand
over
>her mouth.
MIKE: I could say it, but it’s been done.
>    "Washuu-chan", said Aeka, "Sasami-chan's had a bad nightmare and I
>thought that I could discuss it with you so that you can talk to Sasami
>later on."

>    "I'm perfectly capable of talking to Sasami on my own", replied
Washuu.
>"Was there anything specific you wanted to talk to me about?"
CROW: Well, the spermicide cre...
MIKE: (pointing a *very* large glue gun at Crow) Finish that thought. I
dare you.
CROW: I’ll be good.
>    "Nothing at all", said Aeka.  "I just wanted to make sure that
whatever
>words of advice you gave Sasami-chan were most calming.  I would _never_
>think of suggesting the _content_ of your advice."
ALL: _YES_ YOU WOULD!
>    "Oneesan, I don't want that!" exclaimed Sasami.  "I just...  I just
want
>to understand what's going to happen to me.  If it's bad then please tell
me
>all the bad stuff too."
MIKE: If this turns into lemon, I swear to God....
CROW: (drooling madly) Mmmmm.... lemony....
>    "I see", said Washuu, looking between Aeka and Sasami.  "Well, Aeka,
since
>you've told me what you were going to tell me, it's settled. 
TOM: <Washu> NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!
>I'll talk to
>Sasami as soon as breakfast is over, and you don't have to say another
word.
>Isn't that convenient?"
CROW: <Colonel Klink> Very konvenient!


                                  * * * * * *
MIKE: Look! a very localized snowstorm!
TOM: That really bit, Mike.
>    Washuu was the only person in the house that Sasami never had to tilt
her
>head up to talk to.  She looked across at Sasami and asked "Well, what
seems
>to be the problem?"
CROW: <Sasami> Well, I have these huge discharges...
MIKE: (glue gun in hand)...
CROW: ... of psychic energy.
TOM: Good save, Crow.
>    "It's hard to explain", replied Sasami.  "It's a bad dream last night
>but it's not just a bad dream."
ALL: That makes sense.
>    "Please, explain", said Washuu.  Sasami thought that Washuu seemed to
be
>a lot nicer to kids than to grownups.
TOM: Mostly because they’re slow and can’t fight back.
MIKE: Yeah.. HEY! 
> Tenchi and Ryouko were scared by Washuu
CROW: She strips them naked and does lab experiments on them... why would
that be scary?

>but she never did anything to scare Sasami.  Washuu added, "Besides, if
it's
>what I think it is it may be something I'm very interested in."
MIKE: (jumps off seat and glues Crow’s mouth shut) Time Out!!!
TOM: Geez, Mike, he didn’t even say anything yet...
MIKE: He was thinking about it, though.

>    "It's Tsunami", said Sasami.  "I should be dead but I survived by
being
>part of Tsunami but one day Tsunami's going to really be me but I still
want
>to be me..."
TOM: Must....not.. pass out.... run-on ... sentence..
MIKE: Been watching Shatner movies again, I see.
>    "Hold on.  Go a little slower, Sasami-chan. 
CROW: Mmmmghhthvgvhghfjfhhhfgjfdhgfghkvl!!!!!
TOM: Good timing, Nelson.
> I need to be sure I understand
>what you're saying.  Is it that you're afraid of what's going to happen
when
>you merge with Tsunami?"

>    "Hai."
MIKE and TOM: LOW!!
>    "And you don't know what's going to happen.  You don't know how it's
going
>to alter your mind, your feelings for other people....
TOM: That’s basically it....
>  Merging with an alien
>intelligence certainly can be a life-altering experience, but I think
you're
>worried too much.  Everyone changes, Sasami-chan."
MIKE: Resistance is futile.. you WILL be assimilated.
>    "Everyone changes a little bit but not everyone turns into a goddess
tree!
>I want to stay Sasami!"
TOM: ME TOO!
MIKE: (notices Servo’s light is beginning to flash) Tom, are you all right? 
TOM: O_O /Never better!

>    "Everyone changes a lot, Sasami-chan.  I'm no longer the same person I
was
>twenty thousand years ago...  not by a longshot."
CROW: I’m younger!!!
MIKE: How’d you get out of that?
CROW: Spare beak.
>    "You can change but you're still you!  I don't want to be somebody
else
>who doesn't even think like me!  I want to grow up...  I want to be
normal.
>I'm never going to grow up...  I'm going to turn into Tsunami."
TOM:        ___           ___
              /          \      /          \
            I             I    I           I     he ehe eheheheh!
             \   ___  /      \  ___  /
                        _____
MIKE: I think he’s losing it... I’ll get the continuity insulators. (Runs
off)
>    "Don't be silly", answered Washuu.  "Of course you'll grow up."  There
was
>a little hesitation in her voice, which Sasami instantly noticed.
CROW: <Sasami> yeah, I see you, Hesitation, now get out of here!
>    "How long is it, Washuu-san?  How long before I merge with Tsunami?"
>    "It's nothing to worry about."
TOM: Really, who cares?
>    "You didn't say how long."
TOM: Really, who cares?
>    "If you really want to know, Sasami-chan, I did an extrapolation from
the
>power readings you've been giving off.  There's a 92 percent chance that
it
>happens in three Earth years."  Sasami began sobbing.  "Wait, Sasami-chan,
don't
>cry."
MIKE: (returning with a cup of blue goo) How is he?
TOM: Really, who cares?
MIKE: (dumping the fluid into Servo’s dome) That bad, eh?
TOM: IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW- IT WAS A PLOT DEVICE!!!!
CROW: Yeah, he’s fine...

>    "I'm going to be gone in three years.  I should have died back on
Jurai."
TOM: Then we wouldn’t have to sit through this.
MIKE: A bit dark today?
>    "Sasami!  Calm _down_.  That doesn't mean that you're going to be
dead.
>Tsunami's not going to eat you;
CROW: ...
MIKE: Pass on it.
TOM: Mmmm...Sasami.
> you're _both_ going to be assimilated with each
>other.  There should still be a lot of you left.
CROW: <Washu> I can put in replacement parts as needed.
>  Besides, there's no evidence
TOM: Then the case will be dismissed before it ever gets to trial.
>that Tsunami's personality will be so strong as to..."
MIKE: ... completely kill you.
>    There was a knock on the door.  Good, thought Washuu, they're finally
>learning to knock before entering.
TOM: I knew the shocker on the knob would work.
MIKE: Classical conditioning folks...
CROW: Shameless psychology principle #1
>  "Come in", she said.
(Mike cocks the glue gun)
(Crow stays quiet)
>  Aeka walked in and looked at Sasami, then threw a royal sneer at
>Washuu.  "What did you tell her, Washuu-chan?" she asked angrily.  "Poor
>Sasami-chan's crying."

>   Washuu nonchalantly ignored the sneer, explaining what happened in her
>lecturing voice.  "Aeka, I told her the truth.  She's interpreted it in
the
>worse possible way.  She thinks she's going to die, and she's not.  She's
going
>to become part of a greater being, that's all."
TOM: Oh, ok, I though it was something major..
>    "That's _all_?  That's like something you'd say to someone about to be
>eaten by a cannibal.  What's the difference between becoming part of a
greater
>being and dying? 
MIKE: Well, actually, that IS the difference, but...
> Either way, it's not _yourself_ that's there."

>    "It's difficult to explain."
CROW: <Washu> She’ll breed. You’ll die...
MIKE: Crow...
CROW: Ah, bite me Nelson.
>    "I'm sure it is", replied Aeka.  "I think you should do something for
her,
>not frighten her."

>    Aeka hardly ever talks back to me, though Washuu.
CROW: Perhaps she needs to be a guinea pig... (drools)

>  She should just brush off Aeka 
TOM: You’d think a princess of Jurai wouldn’t have dandruff, but...
>and...  of course.  That was it.  It's a family thing. 
ALL: (singing) We are family...
> She's 
>concerned
>for her sister, like someone would be concerned for their child.  Well,
guess
>Aeka can be forgiven.
CROW: NO! ALL ARE PUNISHED!!!!
TOM: Where’d that come from?
MIKE: Really. Shakespeare, Crow?
CROW: Hey, I’m not JUST a pervert, y’know...
>    "Sasami-chan?" asked Washuu.  She didn't respond.  "Sasami-chan?  I'm
>sorry for upsetting you."

>    "It's not you, it's what's going to happen."
MIKE: It’s not you, it’s me...
TOM: Dredging up old memories, Nelson?
MIKE: Yeah.... hey!
>    "I don't think it's as serious as you think, Sasami-chan.  Here, how
about
>this.  If you ever think that something's happening to you because you're
>merging with Tsunami, you come to me.  I'm the greatest scientist in the
>galaxy, I'm not going to let you just fade away to nothing."
CROW: <Washu> If it comes to that, I’ll blow you away in a spectacular
fashion!
>    "Oneesama?" asked Sasami.
TOM:  Twoesama, Threesama, Four...
>    Aeka nodded.  "It's all right, Sasami-chan.  If anyone can do it, she
can."

>    "Then okay", said Sasami.

                                  * * * * * *
CROW: HEY! Watch it with those throwing stars!!

>    Sasami had kept the childish belief that adults can do anything, at
least
>where Washuu was concerned.  
TOM: Does Washu really qualify as an adult?

>Which was just as well, since where Washuu was
>concerned, it was usually right.  A week later, Sasami went to an Earth
school
>for the first time, and really did forget about the Tsunami problem.  
CROW: In which case, the fanfic ends. Bye. (starts to get up)
MIKE: siddown Crow.
>For a
>while, anyway.

>    Several months later, Sasami knocked on Washuu's door again.
TOM: It took several months to knock on the door? Wow.

>  "Come in,
>Sasami", said a voice, and Sasami was instantly teleported to Washuu's
>lab.
MIKE: Can’t she just OPEN the door and go in?
>    "How did you know it was me?" asked Sasami.

>  "Oh, it was your distinctive knocking pattern!  I've programmed the
computer
>to look for subtle, inaudible, variations in the vibrations.  Anyway, this
is
>about Tsunami?"
ALL: WHY ELSE?
>    Sasami didn't ask how Washuu had known that part.  Anyway, she had to
tell
>her.  "Washuu-san, there was an accident at school.  Akira-kun was
sneaking
>around and he got caught in the machinery around the clock..."

>    "Well, that happens.  Is he okay?"
CROW: <Sasami> Of course not! He got caught in the machinery around the
clock!
TOM: Exactly how does one get caught in clock machinery? 
MIKE: Smile and nod.

>    "He's okay...  I rescued him.  Do you remember that dimension you
>accidentally sent me into, the one where I was at school and I turned into
a
>superhero?"
TOM: <the mask> I could be... a SUPERHERO!!!!
>    "Hai...  you're not saying you turned into Pretty Sammy _here_, are
you?"

>    "I did do it and I rescued him, Washuu-chan...  but I think I was
stealing
>power from Tsunami to do it and I don't know if Tsunami likes it.  I don't
even
>know if it's right to take power from a goddess like that.  I know that
>Tsunami's a goddess for sure...  I just know that."
CROW: Everyone else does too, y’know.

>    Washuu shrugged.  "I don't see anything wrong with it, Sasami-chan. 
She's
>not using that power.  You may as well have some.  By the way, what do you
>mean you just know?"
TOM: <Sasami> I just KNOW... OKAY?
>    "I think...  I think when I used that power I remembered some things
that
>Tsunami remembers.  Tsunami was a goddess who was also a tree.  I think I
>remember doing it, but it wasn't really me!  I wasn't there then!  I'm
turning
>into her.  I can feel it, Washuu-san."  Sasami shuddered a little.
CROW: It feels like...
MIKE: Watch it Crow. 
CROW: home.. that’s what I was going to say! Really!

>    "Listen, sit down, oneesan", said Washuu, motioning to a seat.  Sasami
>started to sit down and suddenly stopped.
TOM: Breaking in half because of the stress.
>    "What did you call me?" asked Sasami.
CROW: <Washu> yeah, you heard me!

>    "You're right, Sasami-chan", said Washuu.  "You are starting to
remember.
>Because Tsunami wasn't the only one.  I was a goddess once..."  Sasami's
eyes
>slowly began to widen. 
TOM: Until they exploded and splattered Washu...
>"Tsunami was my sister, before I became like I am
>now.  I blocked it out of my head and gave up my power, but it was
inevitable
>that I'd realize it just from my own research.  You see, I've finally
figured
>out the origin of Ryouko's gems."
MIKE: Well, that was convenient!
>    "Really?  Do you remember things too?"

>    "No, Sasami-chan, but I will.
CROW: How’d she get so smart if she couldn’t remember anything?

>  I must not have understood anything about
>being human when I chose to do it.  But my memories are a part of me and
if
>I once decided to reject them, I've decided to accept them.  You should
too."

>    "But..." said Sasami, unable to think of how to say it.
MIKE: Words tend to be useful in these situations.
>  What Washuu was
>saying was strange, but Sasami believed it...  if it was possible for
Sasami
>to go to a school with no guards and nobody calling her a princess,
anything
>was possible. 
TOM: Actually, they still call you princess, you’re the Ice Queen.
MIKE: That was cold, Tom.
> But Washuu was still different.  Washuu's goddess wasn't someone
>else, she was Washuu.  Tsunami wasn't Sasami, and if Sasami became
Tsunami,
>there would _be_ no more Sasami.
CROW: And if there was no Sasami, then there would be no Tsunami, so Sasami
wouldn’t have survived, so Tsunami couldn’t merge with her, so Sasami
wouldn’t have to merge with her, but she’d be dead, so it wouldn’t matter.
TOM: What was that?
MIKE: It was non-hentai, so I won’t comment.
                                  * * * * * *
CROW: ah, forget it. I’m out of material.
>    It continued like that as the months stretched on into years.  
TOM: Wow, what a long month.
MIKE: Really.

>A week
>before Sasami's fourteenth birthday, her mother came to visit.  She and
Yosho
>talked about the presents Sasami was going to get, carefully speaking in
Old
>High Juraian to keep Sasami from suddenly wandering in and listening in.
CROW: So, if she just listened in, she’d understand, right
MIKE: Uh... no.
>    Sasami wandered in and listened in anyway.  
TOM: <Yosho> Dammit! All our exhaustive preparations were for naught!
>Misaki immediately hugged her
>so hard she was nearly smothered, and then Yosho prepared to escort her
out of
>the room.
CROW: <Yosho> All right, Misaki, you’ve had enough!
TOM: <Misaki> But she’s still alive!
MIKE: The darkness has overwhelmed you. 
BOTS: Join us, Mike.
>    "Let's keep her here.  She can't understand us", said Misaki.
ALL: Wanna bet?
>    "It's a sweater, a kimono, a recipe book, and a set of the Jurai
>Encyclopedia", murmured a voice from near Misaki's chest.
CROW: <Misaki> The alien! It’s still alive!
>    "How did you know that?" Misaki asked.
TOM: <Sasami> well, I could understand what you were saying, so...
>    In reply, Sasami only cried.
MIKE: I guess she wanted a Playstation.
                                  * * * * * *
TOM: NO! No more star jokes!
>    In the following months, Sasami remembered lots.  She felt a strange
power
>sometimes, and knew that if she tried to recall how to use it she could do
a lot
>more than just become Pretty Sammy. 
CROW: Yeah! She could.... um... I’ll pass.
> But she didn't want to.  And she not
>only had dreams, but remembered things when she was awake.  Things that
happened
>a long, long, time ago, oddly devoid of emotion. 
MIKE: I guess Tsunami is autistic or something.
> She recalled when Tokimi left
>the other two goddesses, and remembered watching over the planet Jurai
when
>she was the only one around.  She wasn't impatient like a human would be;
>she was just there, she had decided to do it, and she would do it until
she
>decided to do something else.
TOM: Kinda like Dr. Forrester, huh?
>    That something else had been to become human, and when the opportunity
came
>to her upon Ryouko's attack and an injured Sasami's presence, she took
it....
CROW: And was promptly charged, for grand theft body.
                                  * * * * * *
MIKE: Hey, if they’ve given up, I’m going to.
>    And now, Sasami had just began high school.  Time passed fast, when
that
>was all the time she had left.  Sasami had another week left as herself
>before...  before what?  
ALL: (singing) It’s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine...

>There were already all those memories of things that
>she didn't do,
TOM: How can she remember things she didn’t do??!!
MIKE: Stay frosty, Tom, we’re almost done...
> but Tsunami, the goddess, did.  Would Tsunami completely take
>her over in another week?  She tried to talk to Tsunami once, in her mind. 
It
>didn't work; nobody answered. 
CROW: The number you have dialed has been disconnected for failure to pay
utilities...
> Sasami wanted to be a more normal girl; being a
>princess no longer mattered any more, but she had a worse problem.  Being
>Tsunami.
MIKE: I hate it when that happens! One day you’re a regular old human, then
you’re a omnipotent goddess. Damn the luck!

>    Sasami wandered, one last time, to Washuu's door and knocked.
TOM: <Sasami> Aeka says I can’t come here anymore...
                                  * * * * * *
ALL:  Not gonna do it.
>    "Washuu-san!  Washuu-san!" shouted Sasami as the door let her in.  "I
want
>to talk with you, please!"

>    "Oh, just call me oneesan."

>    "That's not funny!  You know I'm afraid when I do that.  Afraid of
becoming
>someone else...  it's going to happen in just a few days and then I _will_
be
>calling you oneesan and there won't be any more Sasami."
CROW: No more Sasami? But they told us we had a ten year supply, minimum!
>    "No, Sasami-chan", said Washuu.  "I've done a review of my earlier
>calculations.  I was off by about a year.  You can stop worrying."
MIKE: Sure, you say that now...

>    "Oh", said Sasami, but then a thought crossed her mind. 
TOM: It was a long journey for that lone thought, fraught with peril...
> "Are you trying
>to make me feel better so it happens before I'm prepared for it or did you
>really make a mistake?"
MIKE: Telling Washu she made a mistake? That, in and of itself, is a death
sentence.

>    "I didn't make a mistake.  A mistake would be if I said the date was
100
>percent certain.  Anyway, Sasami-chan, I made something of a breakthrough.
ALL: (sing) Break on through to the other side!!
>I have enough of my own memories back, and I can confirm some things that
you
>probably haven't even considered.
CROW: Try me.

>    "Fifty thousand years ago in Earth time, I was a goddess.  There was
>something missing at the time, something missing from all three of us.  It
was
>humanity."

>    "Humanity?"
TOM: Well, they weren’t human, so that explains that.
>    "Yes.  We could do anything, but we really didn't understand why
people
>had feelings, or what it was like to be someone eats and sleeps and falls
in
>love and has a real family.  Just sentients with great power, but no
purpose.  
>So one day, one of the goddesses left, Tokimi, on a quest for humanity.  I
>don't know what happened to her, but I'm starting to get an inkling of
that.
>But it's a story for another day. 
CROW: Oh boy. MORE!
> Now, the next to leave was me.  I gave up
>everything, I put my power in the gems, forgot everything.  When I created
>Ryouko, I only recalled that I was giving her something very precious. 
And
>I think that in the end, being human is worth it.
MIKE: Well, except for the pain and dying part...
>    "There was one left", 
TOM: THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!

>continued Washuu.  "Tsunami.  She became human in her
>own way.  You see, neither of us quite understood what it meant to be
merged
>with Tsunami.  Tsunami didn't have much in the way of feelings beyond a
little
>curiosity, until you came along.  All the emotions, all the personality,
all
>the wants and desires and fears, in the combination, came from you.  I
hope
>you understand this.  Sasami-chan, there is no way you can lose anything
of
>yourself by combining with Tsunami."
CROW: <Washu> Everything, on the other hand...
>    "You mean...  I'll be merged with Tsunami in another year but I'll
still
>be me?" asked Sasami.
ALL: What-ever.
>    Washuu shook her head.  "No, I was a year off, but that doesn't mean
that
>you'll be fully merged with Tsunami in another year."  Pausing, she
finished the
>explanation.  "It happened last summer."
TOM: Haha! I know what you did last summer!

>END
ALL: O_O

“Well, that wasn’t too bad, I guess....” Crow remarked.
“Oh, look. Dr. F wants to talk to us!”

Mike hits the button.

DEEP 13
 “I see you’ve survived the fic.... well, Perhaps I will be less merciful
next time...” Dr. F remarked while staring thoughtfully at his infared
cannon

SOL
“Well, sir, how did the world domination thing go?” Mike asked. 

DEEP 13
“Quiet! It broke our garage door, and now I can’t get out to get food,” Dr.
F replied.
Frank hopped up onto a lab table in the background, looking like he was
pretty hungry. “But just wait until my next transmission! A horrible lemon
will come your way! Bwahahahaha!” Frank leaps on to Dr.F and starts
chewing.
“Yeagggghhh!!! The button, the button!”


Fade to black..


MSTer’s notes 
Whew! this stuff is fun! I’ve gotta thank Ken Arromdee for letting me riff
this thing. It’s been a blast. I think I’m ready to take on a horrible
putrid lemon (or not, but I’m gonna do it anyway). Wish me luck!
C&C, MST, Questions, and Flames should be sent to <Tenchiken@juno.com>
