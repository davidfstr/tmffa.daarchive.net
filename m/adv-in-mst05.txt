(chorus sings)
In the anime dimension,
Somewhere in outer space.
A group of losers who said too much
Are stuck at Quatre's place.
Mr. Winner has made himself a pledge,
After he was pushed beyond the edge.
The Gundam pilot laughs in glee
And carries out his plan of insanity!!

(Quatre:  I'll break you!!!)

Quatre:  (singing)  I'll send them cheesy fanfics,
The worst I can find!  La-la-la!
They'll have to sit and watch them all,
'cause I'm unkind!  La-la-la!

(chorus sings)
They'll travel around the galaxy
and see all kinds of peeps  La-la-la!
They'll fight to keep their sanity,
and this time it's for keeps!

LOSER ROLL-CALL:

TIM!
Tim:  It's mayhem time!

SPIKE!
Spike:  Let's jam!

MARK!
Mark:  Great...here we go!

GEEEEEEEENE!
Gene:  Let's goooooooo!

(chorus sings)
If you wondering how you can watch
something that you read, La-la-la!
remember you can use your mind,
so let it take the lead,
for Voyages of the Winner Queen.

Quatre:  Hello, every...  HEY!  Where are Spike and Gene?

Mark:  Probably still in their quarters.

Quatre:  No matter.  ::Pushes a button.::

::We see Spike in his quarters trying to make a radio to
call Earth.  Quatre's minions rush in and bust the radio.::

Spike:  I was just trying to make a toaster oven!

Gene:  All right! I'm up!  I'm up!

::The other two head to the main living area.::

Quatre:  Good.  Nice to see everyone got a restful night's

Quatre:  Too bad.  Today's lovely number is called "Ryoko's Pet

Mark:  Are we watching a soap opera type Tenchi fic?

Spike:  This kind of fic with peace gets boring really quickly.

Gene:  (as Tenchi)  This is a perfect opportunity to count my
belly button lint collection!

Mark:  Or make a toejam sandwich!

Tim:  (as Sasami)  That accident invlolving Ryo-Ohki and the blender
wasn't pretty.  Whoops!  The bag is starting to leak blood and body
parts!

Gene:  (as Sasami)  I'll bring my own barf bag for the flight.

>"Whatcha up to, Sasami?" Ryoko asks from the tree above.

Mark:  (imitating that infamous beer commercial)  WHAZZUUUUUP!?!?!?!

Spike and Gene:  Oh...

>"Feed them what?"

Gene:  (as Sasami)  These here six-pack rings and styrofoam pieces.

while.

>Ryoko is watching this from her position in the tree.

Tim:  (as Ryoko)  I shall have my revenge!  I'll poop on THEIR heads
this time!

>"Bread crumbs, huh?"  Smiling, she takes off into the distance.

Gene:  Never to be seen again.  Thank you!

=-=-=-=-=

Mark:  Thanks for the pillar from the Parthenon.

Spike:  Maybe the camera didn't get all of the city skyline.  The
buildings are cut off from the top downward.

>An hour later.

Spike:  The fic was dragging on...

>Sasami is washing dishes when she looks curiously into the
>afternoon sky.  Although seeing birds fly around is nothing new,
>watching them

Gene:  Shoot lasers.

>do loops certainly is.  "What in the world?"  Sasami
>puts down the dish and walks outside.  Ryo-Ohki follows, curious.

>As she stands outside, she just watches the birds do tricks in

Tim:  Look out!  The air show's going to end in disaster!

>Looking to the source, "Ryoko?  What are you doing?"

Gene:  Trying to hit two birds with one stone, hehe...

>"Oh, hi Sasami!  I'm just feeding the birds."

>"With what?"

Tim:  With this shotgun.  But they're exploding everytime I shoot
at them!

Gene:  Feces...Uh, I mean, brownies!

>Ryoko tosses one of the projectiles down to Sasami.  "I figured
>they'd like these better."

Mark:  Wow.  Ryoko's feeding them artillery shells from the fireworks
shop!

Spike:  I don't think their mouths are big enough for a cannonball.

>Looking at it, "a donut ball?"

Mark:  What did you expect?  South Park's Chef's Salty Chocolate
Balls?

>Ryo-Ohki's ears perch upwards at the thought.  "Meow!"

Tim:  (as Ryo-Ohki's thought voice)  I hope they're made out
of carrots!

>She then takes to the air after the sweet treats.  "Meow!  Meow!"
>she says, trying to grab at one of them.

::All laugh.::

Tim:  This sounds like a children's book!

>Ayeka walks out of the house.  "What is going on out here?"

Mark:  Quick!  Hide the porn and booze!

Spike:  (as Aeka)  Quit having fun without me!

>Ryoko hears her rival and sends a donut ball towards her, but only
>grazes the top of her hair.  The bird that followed, however, did
>not miss.

All:  OUCH!

Gene:  Hey, guys.  What is the last thing that goes through a bird's
mind when it hits Aeka's face?

Tim:  What, Gene?

Gene:  Its butt!

Spike:  Real cute.

Tim:  Oh, yeah.  A modification of the bug and windshield joke.
That's real quick thinking, Gene.

>Laughing hysterically, "there's no reason to eat crow yet,
>princess!"

Mark:  Crow is on our lunch menu!  The donut balls are for breakfast!

>Rubbing her face, Ayeka

Mark:  Makes the injuries worse and gets an infection.

>walks into the house for her own projectiles.  Picking up a
>few vegetables,

Gene:  A gatling gun, and a nuclear warhead...

>she uses her power to shoot them at her enemy.  "Take that!"

Spike:  Uh.  Shouldn't she get out of the house?

Tim:  (as Aeka)  Take that, house!

Mark:  ::Makes crashing noises.::

>Ryoko uses her gem power to slow and redirect the carrot portion,
>sending them to Ryo-Ohki.  "Now, let's see what you can really do!"

Spike:  (as Ryoko)  Go guided carrots!  Kill Ryo-Ohki!

>Seeing the carrot fly at her,

Gene:  She shit herself.

>"MEOW!"  Her eyes glued to the veggie, she takes off after it.

Spike:  (as kindergarten teacher)  And what did Ryo-Ohki do next,
class?  ^_^

Tim:  (as child)  She eated the cawwot?

>Power diving,

Gene:  Swan diving, and the backflip.

Mark:  So Ryo-Ohki competes in Olympic diving?

>she turns up just as she misses Ayeka, sending the princess to
>her rear.

>Walking out, Tenchi sees an interesting sight.

Spike:  It was a wild, wild orgie!

>The birds are doing stunts in the air, and Ryo-Ohki is chasing
>a flying carrot.

Tim:  Pigs can fly, and hell freezes over...

Gene:  I bet the birds in real life would be like, "You shitmuffins!
Let me have my damn food!"

>"What's going on out here?"

Mark:  That's what I'm thinking.

>Ryoko gently tosses down a treat.  "Hello, Tenchi.  I'm just
>having a little fun with the birds."

All:  AUUUGH!

Mark:  Beastiality!  That's disgusting!  ::Makes muffled vomiting
noises but does not actually vomit..::

>Walking out of the house, Washu has her usual calm look to her.
>"It figures."

Tim:  (as Washu)  My daughter shouldn't have snooped through
my gag pictures of me doing nasty stuff in my Science Academy
days.  Ah, the game of Truth or Dare...added to a little
alcohol.

>"That's enough, Ryoko," Sasami says.  "They don't like to be
>teased this long."

Spike:  Where would she get a book saying how long birds don't
like getting teased?

>"Oh, alright."  She lets her donut balls get eaten by the birds,
>and Ryo-Ohki gets her carrot.

Gene:  And they lived happily ever after.

>Finally, she sends out a shower of rolled up sweets into the
>woods, sending the birds away.

Gene:  (as Ryoko)  Go forth, my feathered army of darkness!

>"It makes sense that you'd do this, Ryoko," Washu states.

Tim:  (as Washu)  It makes sense that would do such a specific
and unexplained event that no one could have guessed from the
beginning of this fic!

>Ryoko looks down at them, smiling, "and why is that?" she asks,
>juggling a few more spherical pastries.

Mark:  ::Imitating circus music.::

>"Mrm mrm," is heard next to Ryoko.  Looking over, she sees Ryo-
>Ohki

Tim:  Cool!  Ryo-Ohki turns into a car, too!

>eating Ryoko's ammunition.

Mark:  Hey!  Don't eat Ryoko's armor piercing ammo!

>"Part cat," Ryoko says, "part rabbit."  Looking closer, "all pig."

Gene:  Huh-huh.  Hey guys, what do you get when you cross a cat
and a rabbit?

Tim:  Stop...That's enough.

>"Meow..." she whines, dropping her ears.

Tim:  Awwwww, Ryo-Ohki's depressed about something.

Mark:  When, oh, when will Ryo-Ohki find true love?

>Ryoko takes a donut ball, "well, Ayeka?  Would you like a treat?"

Gene:  (as Ryoko in a playful voice)  Aeka want treat?  ^_^
Roll over!  Play dead!  Good bitch!

Spike:  That one was cold, Gene...

>Ryo-Ohki jumps down with one of the bags, knowing what's coming.

Spike:  (as Ryo-Ohki's thought voice)  I bet they taste good with
carrots!

>"Hey!  Give those back!"

Gene:  (as Ryoko)  Those are my breast implants!

Mark:  (as Ryoko)  Those are covered with a "special" powder!

>Ayeka moves into the cabbit's path, taking the bag, "thank you,
>Ryo-Ohki."

Tim:  (as Aeka)  Yes!  Now I can finally get high!

All:  WHOO-HOO!

>"Meow?"

Gene:  Meow?  Me worry?

>"You wouldn't dare."

Mark:  You wouldn't dare get fat!

Gene:  The biggest dare of all:  Kiss Tenchi on the lips!

Others:  Thanks a lot, Gene!

>Ayeka just smiles as she sends five donut balls at Ryoko, courtesy
>of her Jurai power.   "Have a ball!"

Spike:  Ha? Ha? Ha?.  That was so...funny?

>Deflecting the treats, Ryoko takes a few more in her hand.

Tim:  (as Ryoko)  Eat this!  (returns to normal)  Ha?  Ha?

>She then launches them at Ayeka, who shields herself.

>"Food Fight!" Sasami yells.

Mark:  Great...Here we go!

>After a few minutes, every donut ball has been impacted,

Tim:  And the Earth is in ruin...

>whether on the ground, or on someone.

Gene:  Or on the ground...or...some...thing.

>Ayeka seems to have taken the most, for she is covered in crumbs.
>Ryoko on the other hand, only has a few squashed pastries on her
>body.

Spike:  Never fly by your own power when it's the peak of pastry
season.  You'll only get the same effect as driving in the peak
of bug season: bugs on the windshield.  Well, pastry guts on your
clothes.

Mark:  (as Ryoko)  Damn!  It's going to take forever to get these
pastry guts off my clothes!

>Ryo-Ohki walks up to the sitting Ayeka, and takes a halfway
>squashed ball off her kimono.  Eating it, she just relaxes
>and meows contently.

Tim:  Like, Meow, man!  Totally funkadelic!  Whoa!  The walls are
growing faces!

>Sasami walks out from behind the tree, crumb free.  "Is the war
>over?"

Spike:  (as Sasami)  Is the war on treat crumbs over?  I'm proud I
was treat crumb free!

Gene:  Partnership for a Treat Crumb-Free America...and Japan.

>Tenchi walks out of the house, crumb free as well.  "It seems so."

>"Well, Ryoko," Washu says, "did you enjoy yourself?"  A second
>later, a donut ball gets mashed into her.

Spike:  Donut implants!

>"I guess so."

Tim:  I guess she enjoyed herself on some kind of urge that was
never explained in this fic.

> :::-!end!-:::

Mark:  Look at that beautiful craftsmanship.  I've never seen a
wood carving with the word "end" inscribed on it.  It's beautiful.
Especially the "end" part.

> -Can anyone guess what I'm munching on?

All:  HELL, NO!  O_O;;

Mark:  Guess what I'm munching on and have nightmares for life!

Quatre:  And now for the feature presentation!



>Tenchi and all associated characters are the property of Pioneer and
>some other company

Tim:  Ummm, AIC?  How easy is that to forget?

>Send E-Mail to  thtadthtshldntbe@home.com

Mark:  Send mail to a bunch of consonants and a couple of vowels at
home.com!

>my name is Matthew Marino

::All wave::

All:  HI!

>And no I am not 15

Spike:  Sure you aren't...

>I am much older though I would love to be stuck to Ryoko.

Spike:  Wouldn't we all?

>Setting-OVA continuity plus Kiyune (she's hot, 2nd best after Ryoko).

Mark:  Oh, great.  Another one who doesn't know how to spell Kiyone's
name properly.

>After the confrontation with Kagato

Tim:  And before the confrontation with the Lint Ball people.

Spike:  Been eating bleach again, Tim?

Tim:  Uh, no!

---------------------------------------------------------------

Gene:  Look out!  Machine gun fire!  Oh, wait, just lines.

>RYOKO'S NEW PET part 1- Is He House Broken?

Tim:  Awwww, Ryoko gets a puppy!

>The skies of San Diego were filled with fire as Tsunami, manifest

Spike:  With a bunch of ticks and lice.

>with all 10 lighthawk wings destroyed enemy battleship after
>battleship.  Hundreds of smaller (than Tsunami at least) ships
>darted around and were destroyed.

Tim:  Darn mosquitoes.

>This blazing glory would have been a spectacular sight for the people of
>San Diego but none of them seemed to notice it.

Mark:  Because they were dead maybe?

>On the ground Tenchi and his companions battled valiantly to keep the 
>invading Soruylian forces

Gene:  Our heroes fought valiantly against some unknown force that
hadn't even been introduced!

>from gaining a foothold on the earth. Washu was busy at the 
>controls of a mysterious machine ( as usual).

Tim (a-la-original MST3K cast):  Look!  Washu has a com-pu-ter!  Wow!

>"Tenchi you must finish them off quickly.

Spike:  The fajitas will go bad if you don't finish them off quickly!

>My psychonulifier won't keep these people from noticing for much
>longer. There is just too much energy spilling about."

Mark:  I spilled my Energy Big Gulp!

> <Why do I have to do everything -sigh- The girls have almost as much 
>power.

Gene:  Men are covert slaves of women.  Didn't you know that, Tenchi?

>I knew we should have made grandfather come. > "Ok Little Washu. I'll
>see what I ca..."  All of a sudden the fighting seemed to stop.

Tim (as a Soruylian or whatever):  Fighting is pointless!  We quit!

Spike (as one, too):  That's our cue for the pointless sex to begin!
Let's get out of here!

>Ryoko teleported in beside her mother and Tenchi. Even in the middle
>of battle she was as horny as ever.

Gene:  I can see Ryoko having sex in the middle of a battle.  Can you?

Tim:  Maybe she was stripteasing in battle and the bad guys stopped
to peek.

>She draped herself across Tenchi's back

Spike (as Martha Stewart):  And now we look at our lovely Ryoko Drape
Collection!  It suits all of Tenchi's backs well and comes in all kinds
of colors!

>as she roared,

Tim:  GGRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!

Mark:  MOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

Gene:  BAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

Spike:  HOOOOOOOOOONNNNKKKKKK!!!!!!!

>"What the hell do you think has happened my Tenchi?"

Tim (as Tenchi):  Mommy!

>"You're lucky I turned off my lighthawk wings Ryoko or you would get 
>jabbed with something you really wouldn't want to get jabbed with."

All:  EEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!

>All three of them

Mark:  Beat Tenchi and left him for dead for making a sexual statement.

Spike:  Tenchi beat himself up?

Mark:  Yeah!  Tenchi is so dumb he wouldn't know if he beat himself!
::Pauses::  That didn't sound right.

>laughed

Spike:  I don't see how they would laugh at such a nasty joke.  Ugh!

>at Tenchi's counter quip. Tenchi had begun to counter the girls overt
>passes with a wry sense of humor.

Gene:  The side of Tenchi we ::yawn:: never see.

>Washu thought it was a sign of maturity or at least a sign that he
>was

Tim:  Asking for a death wish.

>almost done with puberty. She still wondered how

Gene:  Tenchi could be acting out of character.

>a teenage boy stuck in the midst of a nest of intergalactic
>experienced beautiful women, all of whom were at least ten
>years older than him, had been able to keep his pants zipped.

Gene:  Experiment away Washu...

Spike:  But don't tell us your findings, okay?  We really don't want
to know.

>She had long ago concluded

Spike:  WHAT DID I JUST SAY!?!?!?!!?

Tim:  Break time!

::Everyone gets up and leaves.::

Tim:  What do you think of this fic so far?

Mark:  Ummm, pointless?

Gene:  ::YAWN!::

Spike:  Tired, Gene?

Gene:  Nah.  Nothing I can't handle.

Tim:  You sure?  You look real tired.

Gene:  I'm sure.  ::YAWN.::

Spike:  Okay.

Mark:  Well, back on to the subject.  This fic sucks ass.

Tim:  That's pretty down to the point.

Spike:  And super cruel.

::Jim appears on a screen.::

Jim:  Hey, guys.  Just letting you know I'm about to test the
sub-ether drives.

Spike:  Okay.

Tim:  Where did the others disappear to, Gene?

Gene:  The others from the Outlaw Star?  They're down the hall.
There are extra rooms besides ours.  I guess Quatre really
prepeared for a situation like this.

::Alarms go off and lights flash.::

Tim:  Bad fanfic alert!

ever seen!  Prepare to die!

Spike (as Ryoko):  If you don't want to die that way, Tenchi, then
jab me with that thing you mentioned earlier!

Spike:  Good thing it's going to fall on that hospital.

Gene:  And there's a hydrogen processing plant right next to it.

>The gang had used one of Washu's psycho prods (as in Psychic cattle

Mark:  Wow.  I didn't know you could buy a psychic cattle prod!

Spike:  I see people use one all the time.  They psycially manipulate
cattle so they will attack people.

>to herd away the local bystanders.

Gene:  Okay you lazy people.  Off to the corral!

Tim:  At San Diego Local Bystander farm we've got all kinds of people
for sale.  There's the skinny geek.

Mark:  And the very strange freaks.  Some of them come with assorted
accessories!

Gene:  Ditto.

>There was someone in the Taco Bell.

>She threw him over her shoulder and patted him on the ass.

Gene:  Note to self.  Trick Melfina into patting me on the ass.

>Now to get out of her and eat my burrito's before Mihoshi sees them. 

Mark:  I'm quitting while I'm ahead and not saying anything about the
spelling.

>Ryoko was out of time.

Tim:  Pencils down, class!

>She threw up an energy shield.

Spike:  No vomit jokes, anyone...Please

>She hoped it would be enough to protect her french fry boy. She of
>course could survive it easily.

Gene:  KABOOM!!!!!

Spike:  French fry boy's dead!!!  ::Pretends to cry.::

::Others pretend to cry.::

>Washu on the other hand rarely left anything to chance. And that
>only occurred when she couldn't factor out Mihoshi. She poured
>energy down the link between her and Ryoko.

Spike (as Ryoko):  Hey!  Stop pouring energy down the link!  It
takes unleaded only!!

>She was trying to dissipate the energy into subspace. Just then,
>"Hey Little Washu do you mind if I put my hat here? It's messing
>up my hair and I have a big date tonight."

Spike:  Mihoshi on a date?  This IS fan FICTION.

> <Who's that here, Hat,

Gene (a la "Psycho"):  Norman!?!  Who's the hat, Norman!?!?!

> Oh no Mihoshi, no!!!>

Mark:  That sounds like the Mihoshi we love.

>Mihoshi placed her hat on the disruption switch on the Psycho
>nullifier control panel.

Spike:  I have a question.  Why would there be such a switch on
such a complex machine?

Gene:  Yeah!  Is it a universal standard?

>For the briefest of seconds the colossal energies of the crashing
>space ship, Washu's subspace transference and a psychic wormhole
>interacted on Ryoko and her french fry boy. then it all ended 
>in a colossal explosion.

Gene:  KABOOM!

>"Mihoshi, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU. DO NOT TOUCH MY 
EQUIPMENT!!!!!"

Tim:  There goes my appetite.

Gene:  YAWN!  I'm going to sleep.  ::Dozes off.::

>"Now wait a minute Washu," Mihoshi raised her hands submissively
>as she backed away.

Mark:  This is just like Dirty Cops.

::An electric sound comes from the ceiling.::

Gene:  ::Gets shocked::  OOOOWWWWWW!!!

Quatre (on speakers):  Oh, yes.  A reminder to all of you.  Don't
go to sleep.  I watch your every move and will shock you with the
tazers on the theater ceiling every time you try something.

>She had seen that look before. Usually Ryoko had it just before
>she kicked someone's ass. Mihoshi thought her ass was just fine

Spike:  Sure is.  Got to agree with you on that one.

>the way it is ( and so did every guy who ever looked at it ).

Gene:  You've got a good sense of taste, Spike.

>"I don't know what kind of girl you think I am butI don't touch
>other people's equipment until after the third date. And I don't 
>think

Mark:  This fic makes any sense.

>we have gone out even once yet." 

Tim:  Given the fact that Mihoshi's intellegence is questionable,
we can't be sure of the actual number of times.

>Washu couldn't be angry with Mihoshi for very long. Not especially
>since she could sense that Ryoko and her, Washu giggled when she
>thought about what Ryoko called him, her french fry boy were ok.

Gene:  Ten years later Washu''s gonna pull out the album and embarass
Ryoko in front of her boyfriend.

>she finally broke a smile.

Spike:  Look at that!  She broke a perfectly good smile!

Mark:  We just can't have nice things!

>"So you're not going to vaporized her Washu, excuse me Little Washu." 
>Kiyune blurted out.

Spike:  Kiyone should have thought about what she was going to say.

>She had something of a look of disappointment on her face. Ever 
>since she had shown up on this dirt ball backwater planet

All:  HEY!  Earth is our homeworld!  Take that back!

>she had been trying to get 

Tim:  A sexy guy like me!  WHOO-HOO!

>reassigned.

Tim:  Shit!

>On the deepest level she thought of Mihoshi as the littlest sister
>you love beyond belief

Spike:  On the next episode of Beyond Belief:  Loving Mihoshi!

>but can't stand being around. She felt sorry for whatever guy Mihoshi 
>ever married.

Gene:  You know, people should feel sorry for any man that gets
married.

>Just then Ryoko teleported in with a guy over her left shoulder
>and the remains of a Taco Bell lunch special in her right hand.

Tim (as french fry boy):  *Whimper*  Sorry I puked up my lunch in
your right hand.  *whimper*.

>Mihoshi sniffed the air.

Mark:  (as a nature documentary narrator)  Now here the Mihoshi is
sniffing out its prey.

>"Oo. Tacos and french fries.

Mark:  (continuing impression)  The Mihoshi has picked up its prey's
scent and is moving in for the kill!

>Can I have some Ryoko." Ryoko threw Mihoshi the last burrito.
>"What about some french fries, Ryoko. I want some fries."

Gene:  Shut up, you little whining, fry wanting sissy!

>She was starting to pout.

Spike:  Go to America!  They have plenty of food to eat up there!

>"Can't have any of those.

Spike:  You bad girl, you.

>He only gives up french fries if he gets french kissed.

Tim:  Does he?  Do any of you guys know if Aisha wants french fries?
I'll go and be a fry boy.

Spike:  ::Mallets Tim.::

>I got some."

Tim:  DID she?

>Ryoko held up her prize.

Mark:  A dead rat!

Spike:  The biggest booger in the world!

Gene:  A hair clog from the shower drain!

Tim:  A dried piece of bolonga!

>"OOO," Mihoshi and Kiyune at once. Both had fallen in love with
>Earth fast foods since they had landed here. And salty

All:  EEEEWWWWW!!!!!

Mark:  The distance they go to get something to eat.

>french fries were the best. Both stepped up behind Ryoko and made
>a few tentative kisses towards the young man draped over 
>Ryoko's shoulder.

Gene:  This fic should be called "Kinky Cops."

Tim:  Don't mention anything about cops again.  Ever...

>He was however in a deep sleep. " I know how we can wake him up," 
>Mihoshi looked at Kiyune.

Mark:  Sleeping Handsome...  Nah.  Umm, Sleeping Ugly, maybe?

>"Yeah lay him on the ground Ryoko. He'll like this." Ayeka who
>had just walked over face faulted with Tenchi and Ryoko.
>Apparently only Washu understood what they really meant.

Spike (as boy):  Oh, boy..  Oh, mommy!

>"They don't mean that you idiots. They're cops not rapists.

Mark:  I beg to differ.

Tim and Gene:  DON'T START!!!!!!!

>They mean to

Spike:  Oil him up and get a free year's supply of food out of him.

>use CPR. You know mouth to mouth resuscitation."

Gene:  Just as fun though.

>A collective sigh.

Tim:  An incomplete sentence.

>"Well mom open the portal. We have to get home. I want to take a
>bath.  Soruylian's are icky after they have exploded.

All:  EEEEWWWWWWW!

Mark:  There is no dignity in fan fic writing, is there?

>He can't give any more fries out now.

Spike:  George won't play anymore!  I hug him and squeeze him but he
don't move no more!!!

>I put him asleep."  She laid him down and folded her leather jacket
>beneath his head.

Spike:  Where the hell did Ryoko get a leather jacket?

Gene:  Ryoko goes biker punk.

>"Sleep well french fry boy" Washu opened the portal. The gang headed through
>the portal. Ryoko headed through last. She always was the straggler.

Mark:  (as old lady)  Lazy young Ryoko!  In my day I wouldn't goof off and
drag a french fry boy through a portal last.

>About four and a half feet out on the other side she got stuck. She started
>to pull harder. Finally she gave a yank. 

Spike:  She tore the french fry boy in half.

::The MSTers get up and leave.::

Jim:  Quatre says he wants to take it easy a minute.  And he says if we're

Tim:  Cool!

Spike:  Wakie, wakie, french fry boy.

>"OOOOOWWWW, Mother fucker, what the fuck ... OWWWWWW"

Mark:  Good morning to you, too.

>Someone was screaming in pain

Tim:  Duh.

>and writhing on the floor.

Mark:  Torn in half as Spike mentioned earlier.

>The portal had closed. Everyone turned to look and said,

Gene:  French fry boy didn't die?

>"Oh shit" at the same time. It was the french fry boy. He seemed to be 
>unhurt but was in pain.

Mark:  And bleeding to death.

>"What's wrong with him?" Tenchi asked. " And more importantly why is he here."

Tim:  Our Taco Bell boy is dying and don't ask me why he's here.  Ryoko was
the one who brought him along.

Spike:  Ryoko must want french fries real bad.

>Strangely it was Ryoko who answered, "He is in pain from being squeezed 
>throughthe closing dimensional portal. It only hurt though, nothing is
>broken."

Spike:  (as french fry boy)  Whatever!  It crushed my manhood!

>Washu looked at her daughter, "How do you know that?"

Tim:  The script says so.

>"I'm not sure. I can feel what he is feeling. And boy is he in pain. I 
>mean if I were a feeble human I would be on the ground writhing as well."

Gene:  I mean, if I were a little 15 year old loser, I would have a heart
attack if I was surrounded by sexy women, too.

>Ryoko walked over to sit on the couch. As she did, when she tried to go more
>than five feet away, the young man started to drag along behind her.

Mark:  Hey!  They're not married yet!  Ryoko's draggin him along already!

>Tenchi caught a lamp as it tipped over.

Spike:  Washu caught her Boogie Bass before it fell.

>"Gee that's strange. I feel a pull whenever I try to move away from him.
>It's like I have an anchor or something.

Gene:  If it bothers you that bad, stop wearing that anchor necklace!

>But it is really light."

Gene:  Try my Oreck 8 pound vaccum for 30 days or return it with no charge!

>Washu was not the supreme scientific genius in all existence for nothing, 
>In a few moments she had come to a hypothesis as to what had occurred. She
>stared angrily at Mihoshi but only briefly.

Tim:  Mihoshi, you little trickster.

>Everyone saw her however, "Motherrr. What did you do now. Is this one of 
>your stupid experiments?"

Mark:  Oh, the the one where Mihoshi totally messes up the link between
Ryoko and Washu?

>Just then the young man came aware and sat up by Ryoko's feet.

Tim:  Thus the title, "Ryoko's Pet"

>He seemed perplexed. 

>"Where the hell, Um excuse me. Where am.. Oh fuck it. Where the fuck am I.

Spike:  I thought he was going to give up on the question.

>Hey wait a minute I'm not speaking English.

Tim:  Pray tell.  What language are you speaking in right now?

Mark:  This one is dubbed.  Take a close look at it.

>I don't know any other languages.  science majors don't have to take any.

Mark:  They certainly don't have to take grammar classes either.

>Washu's interest came alive, " Are you in college young man. What science."

>"I'm a junior at UCLA. I'm studying physics. I want to go to Berkeley for 
>grad work. Um with all due respect, miss?"

>"Little Washu"

>"Ok Little Washu . where am I."

>"You are at the Masaki shrine in Okoyama Japan." Yosho's voice carried in 
>from the kitchen

Tim:  French fry boy didn't ask you, lumpy!

>as he walked into the living room. "Do we have another guest then." He was
>looking straight at Washu.

Gene:  (as Yosho)  Great, another mouth to feed.  There goes my retirement.

>"Um yes sort of. It's not like he could leave. Unless Ryoko wanted to then 
>he would have to go with her.

Spike:  Yes!  That boy would be so lucky if she took a shower.

>He's not strong enough to make her go anywhere and then if he wanted to stay
>and she didn't then he would have to go with her.

Gene:  Technically he's her toy, now.

>Unless of course she changed her..."

>"WASHU!!! STOP!!!" Everyone yelled at once.

Mark:  Hold the phone.  What was that all about?

Spike:  What does she have to change?

Tim:  Maybe it's like Gren on your show and a sex change...

Spike:  NASTY!  Don't ever mention that name again!  >.<

>She knew that it was time for an explanation.

Gene:  Good idea.

>She knew that the only one who might understand was Yosho and maybe the
>new kid. He said he was a Physics student. Although earth science was
>goobley gook.

>"I can't be in Japan. I was working at Taco Bell in San Diego less than 
>ten minutes ago."

Tim:  (as fry boy)Please send me back!  I love my job at Taco Bell!  I can't
live without it!!!!  I'll lose my health and retiremant benefits!!!

>He looked at his watch for confirmation. "How can I possibly have gotten
>to Japan in less than ten minutes."

Spike:  He walked really fast.

Gene:  Nah, he took the bus.

>He looked at Washu for an explanation. She wondered how she became the
>group spokesperson.

Tim:  (as Washu)  Damn it!  Do I have to do everything around here?!

Mark:  (as Tenchi)  No.  I do the job of being the wuss.  So all the jobs
aren't yours.

> <Oh yeah I am the supreme scientific genius in the universe > 

Mark:  What about what the author said earlier?  Didn't he say everyone
knew everything except Washu and Tsunami?

>She gathered her supreme scientific dignity and put on an air of 
>authority.

Tim:  (as Washu)  Damn, I'm good...

>For some reason everyone started to giggle.

Gene:  Okay.  Who farted?

Spike:  Hee hee.

Mark:  Haha!

Tim:  Whee-hee!

Spike:  Hoho!

Gene:  Bwa-hah!

>Except for the french fry boy. She was starting to like him already.

Mark:  This is the lemon party, right?

>"Ok french fr... What's your name?"

>"Santo Donato Jr, but everyone calls me Sonny."

Tim:  And I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs...

>"Ok Sonny and everyone. You came here in a wormhole. Can you accept
>that?"

Gene:  DUH?  =B

>"After everything else I guess I could."

>"Good then accept the rest on my authority. After all I am the supreme 
>scientific genius in the universe."

Mark:  (as Sonny)  A 12-year old looking person?  Okay!

Spike:  (as Washu)  Jumping off a cliff is good for your health.

Mark:  (as Sonny)  Okay.  ::Imitates falling and splatting noises.::

>Sonny's eyes perked up at that. He seemed more impressed than the others
>at hearing her title.

Gene:  And this is Aeka, the Greatest Incest Promoter in the Universe.

Spike:  And this is Nobuyuki, the Greatest Voyeur in the Universe.

>He was really growing on her.

Mark:  I wouldn't want anyone growing on my ass, though.

>After summing up the events of the battle so Yosho would understand, Ryoko grew
>more and more upset as Washu went on. "Then I wasn't sure that Ryoko and Sonny
>here could survive the blast, so I used some of my pow.. err technology to try
>to shunt the energy into subspace. Just as I did this Mihoshi put her hat on the
>Psycho nullifier and hit the disruption switch. Wam Bam thank you ma'am and now
>Ryoko and the french fry boy are linked physically and psychically on some unknown
>level."

All:  :B  Huh?

>This seemed to reunite Kiyune's and Mihoshi's desire for french fries.

Gene:  Dersires for french fries of Mihoshi and Kiyone unite!  Become one
ultimate desire for those crispy potatoes!

>"You hold his head still and I'll start kissing. Tenchi always seems to get
>away when we try to kiss him and I really want some fries." Mihoshi spoke to
>Kiyune as she straddled Sonny.

Tim:  ::Points to self.::  Stunt double!  Sonny, please leave the set!

>Kiyune knelt behind Sonny as he squirmed under Mihoshi. Kiyune held his 
>head between two hands and Mihoshi started making out with him. Normally
>a 15 year old guy in such a predicament would say what the hell

Gene:  Exactly what I did.  Way to go, kid!

>but being molested by alien chicks in front of an audience was not exactly the
>way Sonny wanted to lose his virginity.

Spike:  This sitcom is filmed before a live studio audience.

>Besides for some reason they seemed to want french fries before they would stop, 
>not that he really wanted them to stop but he did not want to do it with everyone
>standing there and watching.

Tim:  There's Nobuyuki with his camera.  ::Points.::

>He tried to get them off of him but it only took seconds to realize that 
>both of them had super strength or something or maybe all horny chicks had
>super strength,

Gene:  The latter.

>he didn't exactly know. This was as close to a horny chick as he had ever 
>gotten.  Then they decided on a different course of action.

>"This doesn't seem to be working Kiyune."

Gene:  Get the whip!
	
>"You know Ryoko. Maybe she did a little more than kissing to get those 
>fries.  Are you game Mihoshi? I'm feeling really pumped after that battle.
>I need to work up an appetite for those fries." Mihoshi said yes with her
>eyes.

Spike:  Stop delaying and get to the naked girls!!!!

>"Now don't let him up,  Mihoshi, remember Tenchi. These earth boys are
>slippery."

Tim:  And that doesn't even count the grease in their hair.

>They pushed him all the way down flat on his back. Mihoshi still atop him
>with her hands now on his shoulders. Kiyune started to undo his clothing. 

All:  ALL RIGHT!!!!  ALL RIGHT!!!!!  GO SONNY!!!!  WHOO-HOO!!!!!

::The film begins to break.::

All (plus Quatre):  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>"I guess it wasn't such a good idea rewiring the house into the 100 
>gigawatt range. I'm sorry Sonny."

Gene:  Did we miss some kind of electric bondage or something??

Tim:  That would have killed Sonny...

>Sasami, "Is the fish ok?"

All:  O_O;;  ???

Tim:  Whew.  That one's over.

Spike:  Good thing we're about to arive at Tenrei.  I need
a relaxing hot bath.

Gene:  Whatever you do don't intrude at the women's bath!

Tim:  Okay.  We won't!

Gene:  That goes double for you Tim!  Aisha will show no mercy!

Mark:  Anyways this whole thing is over with.  We can take it
easy until next time.

Spike:  I heard you on that one.  I guess the stress all comes
off after we watch those terrible fics.

Mark:  Get used to it.  It's all there is to do.  Watching
fics all day.

::Quatre appears on screen.::

Quatre:  Hey, guys.  I just wanted to let you know that my new
masterpiece is complete!

Spike:  And what is that?

Quatre:  My Ultra Anime Character Dimension Extractor!

All:  Huh?!

Quatre:  It pulls a random anime character out of the anime
universe.  But it uses so much power I can only use it every
once in a while.  It almost has enough power to extract one
character already!

Gene:  Can't wait for you to use it.

Quatre:  I am excited, too.  You will all see it in action soon!

Jim (on speaker):  Ten minutes until proximity of Tenrei's solar
system!!

Tim:  It looks like we're out of time.  Until next show, see you!.
__________________________________________________________________

Next time:  Trouble on Tenrei!  Hot springs turn into battlefields!
Watch the blood rain next time on "Voyages of the Winner Queen"!
And will Quatre's Ultra Anime Character Dimension Extractor work?

Note:  This MST was cut short because of the daunting amount of
time taken to complete it.  Hopefully the original story won't be
cut short next time.
