Disclaimer: Again, I do not own these characters, Pioneer and AIC does.  How
many times do I have to say this?

Author's Note: I got this inspiration from Yamabushi's fanfictions, so I'm
not going to take full credit.  However this is the first one made, so maybe
I should.  Whatever.  Set your bets now on who's going to win, because we're
about to start.  And no wise cracks about me mailing you your money because
you got it right.  Let's see if Anne Robinson can take this crowd!  We're
going to skip the intro and get straight to the questions, since I'm tired
right now.  Oh, and I dedcate this to PRORYOKO, for her encouragement to
continue writing.  Anyway, enjoy!

Anne: Kagato: Let's start with you.  What is the capital of Hawaii?
Kagato:  How should I know?  I probably blew it up all ready.
Ryoko: Answer the damn question!
Kagato: Honolulu, my next stop for conquering the universe!
Anne: Uh huh.  Tenchi, what is the slogan for the soft drink, 7-UP?
Tenchi: Uh, make 7-UP---I can't say it!
Anne: Why not?
Tenchi: It's bad!
Kagato: Damn it Tenchi!  Answer already!
Tenchi: *looks at Kagato* Make 7-UP yours!
Kagato: WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?
Anne: Shut up!  Mihoshi, finish the following equation: E=?
Mihoshi: Easy!  E= ABC!
Anne: Wrong! Ms. Washu--
Washu: I won't do it!  Unless...
Ryoko and Kagato: Here we go...
Washu: YOU CALL ME LITTLE WASHU!!
Anne: Ms. Washu, what are the two sides of magnets?
Washu: North and south.
Anne: Correct.  Ryoko, what is--I cannot complete the question.
Ryoko: What the hell?
Anne: Out of the possible 125,000, you banked a miserable, pathetic,
worthless amount of 0.
Kagato:  We'll see about that, after I rob your bank account.
Anne: Vote who you think is the Weakest Link now!
*Funky music playing*
Anne: Let's see the votes!
Kagato: Mihoshi.
Tenchi: Myself.
Mihoshi: I don't know.
Washu: Mihoshi.
Ryoko: Kagato.
Kagato: YOU WRETCHED LITTLE GIRL!
Anne: It seems that Mihoshi is off.  Washu, why did you vote for Mihoshi?
Washu: She's stupid.
Kagato: Hear hear!
Anne: Mihoshi, you are the Weakest Link!  Good bye!
Mihoshi: Do I get cookies?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anne: We'll start from the strongest link from the last round, and that was
Kagato, since he took the least time to answer.  Kagato, what is the name of
the place where you can save your money?
Kagato: Bank!
Anne: I'm sorry, you can't bank now.
Kagato: BANK!!
Anne: I said, you can't bank!
Kagato: THE ANSWER IS BANK, DAMMIT!
Anne: Wrong.  The answer is not bank, dammit.  Tenchi, where would you go to
buy  trees?
Tenchi: Jurai?
Anne: Wrong!  Washu, what is the name of the singer who sings the song "Chop
Suey?"
Washu: Chinese Man?
Anne: Wrong! Ryoko, what is the--I cannot finish the question.
Ryoko: Son of a -----
Anne: Now, vote for who you think is the weakest link.  Oh, and you still
have zero dollars.
*More funky music, until Kagato blasts the speakers*
Anne: The moment of truth!  Show your votes!
Kagato: Tenchi.
Tenchi: Myself.
Washu: Myself, screw this game!  I got a question wrong, and I wasn't
supposed to!
Ryoko: Kagato.
Kagato: CURSE YOU!
Anne: Tenchi is out of the game.
Ryoko: NOOOOOO!!!!
Anne: Tenchi, why did you vote for yourself?
Tenchi: I don't want to sit next to Kagato.  He's holding a light saber.
Kagato: I voted for the little creep for revenge!  Hey, Tenchi, challenge
you to chess later.
Tenchi: OK!
Ryoko: DAMN YOU KAGATO!!
Kagato: HAHAHAHA!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anne: Three more people, no money.  Who's going to win? Let's start with the
strongest link, Ryoko, since she didn't answer a question wrong.
Ryoko: I never answered a question at all.
Anne: We have a bonus question for you!  Get this right and automatically
win!  In Japanese, what does Kagato's name mean?
Ryoko: What?  It means "Senile old idiot with stupid glasses the size of his
nose with gray hair that shreds ribbons."
Anne: That is incorrect.
Kagato: YOU STUPID---
Tiki: Sorry to interrupt, but the following words are censored for your
health.  Let's go back now.
Kagato: I'M GOING TO-----
Tiki: *sweatdrop* Still censored.  Let's check now.
Kagato: AND I"LL---
Tiki: When does this guy shut up?
Kagato: NEVER TIKI!  GET OUT OF HERE!
Tiki: *gulp* Yes, I'm out!  Don't blame me if you end up on Jerry Springer.
Anne: Anyway, here's your regular question Ryoko.  In what---
We now interrupt you for a preview of Dawson's Creek.
10 minutes later...
Anne: I cannot complete the question.
Ryoko: DAMN YOU!  I only answered one question,and a stupid one too.
Washu: Tiki, put me back in this fanfic NOW!
Tiki: Yes ma'am.
Washu: Never mind! Screw you guys, I'm out of here!
Anne: I guess that leaves you two, fighting for an amount of zero.
Kagato: That sucks, don't you think Ryoko?
Ryoko: First and last time I'll agree with you.
Kagato: Wanna kill her?
Ryoko: No, you go ahead.  I killed Regis last week.
Kagato: Thanks.  YAAAA!
Anne: NOOOO!


Tiki: Thanks for watching the Weakest Link.  I would wink, but I can't.  You
wanna know who won?  Tenchi won at chess, but I have no idea who won the
game, and I'm the fanfiction writer!  Oh well.  Tune in next time!
