Here is the list I came up with while killing some time (which I have had way to 
much of lately).  If you have any additions you might think of just e-mail me 
them and if I get enough I'll update it.

In the spirit of Jeff Foxworthy;

You are WAY too into Tecnhi Muyo! if...

...you can name all the voice actors, both Japanese and English, for every 
character.

...you've read "Aiken Muyo" in it's entirety...twice.

...you've scoured the internet looking for a picture of Petrea Burchard, only to 
be disappointed when you find out she looks nothing like Ryoko.

...you know who Petrea Burchard is.

...you threw a party to celebrate the announcement of the release of the third 
OAV.

...you have started high-dollar betting pools on who Tenchi will choose in the 
third OAV.

...you've picked apart scene-by-scene the episode "No Need for Resident 
Officers" to see if Kiyone and Mihoshi are REALLY a lesbian couple.

...you cried at the end of "No Need for Ryoko".

...you watched "Tenchi in Tokyo" all the way through JUST because it was Tenchi 
related.

...you have masturbated to any onsen scene (so I've heard of people doing...).

...you can't listen to a song without mentally re-writing the lyrics to fit 
Tenchi.

...you actually get truly ANGRY when you see how much Cartoon Network butchered 
the series.

...you have more than 2 megs of Tenchi related mpegs on your hard drive.

...your other anime-fan friends are fucking sick of hearing about Tenchi stuff 
from you.

...you've written any Tenchi fanfics.

...you've dressed as a Tenchi character for any occasion (Halloween, party, 
con., etc.).

And the number one thing that shows you are WAY to into Tecnhi is...

...you sit at your computer on a Sat. night and write a totally pointless list 
about it.
