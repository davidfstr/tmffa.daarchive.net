"The Space Song"
When space pirate and laser beams are running through your head
Television freak show mad scientist everywhere
Subspace makes me nervous people pushing me too far
Got to break away so take my hand now because
I want to live like in space
Carless and free like in space
I want to live
I want to fly through space the wind in my hair and the silence
at my ear

I've been having difficulties keeping to myself
Feelings and emotions better left up on the girls
Alien children tell the truth they never lie
Which one is more truthfull?
There's a thought now you decide
Compassion in space
Compassion in your hands
Would you like to make a run for it?
Would you like to take my hand?

I want to live like in space
Carless and free like in space
I want to live
I want to fly through space the wind in my hair and the silence
at my ear
Sometimes this life can get you down
It's so confusing there's so many girls to love
But I don't feel it because I just run away in my mind

When space pirate and laser beams are running through your head
Television freak show mad scientist everywhere
Alien children tell the truth they never lie
Which one is more truthfull?
There's a thought now you decide

Compassion in space
Compassion in your hands
Would you like to make a run for it?
Would you like to take my hand?

I want to live like in space
Carless and free like in space
I want to live
I want to fly through space the wind in my hair and the silence
at my ear
