       Fell into a dream again, wish the dream would never ever end
           Met an angel with eyes the deepest gold I’ve ever seen
                        Just wish it wasn’t a dream

                                  Chorus:
             She took me away and we flew across the skies
     This angel looked familiar, and then I opened up my eyes to see
                            It was just a dream

   Two days later I saw you, remembered my dream, can this be true?
       You’re the angel with eyes the deepest gold I”ve ever seen
                      This time it wasn’t a dream

         A few days later I looked into, the lovely eyes of you
      I told you about my dream, and then your eyes began to gleam

                                Chorus:
            We took hand in hand, and we walked across time
             And every day I thank God for making you mine

            We took hand in hand, and we walked across time
             And every day I thank God for making you mine

                       Thank you for being you
