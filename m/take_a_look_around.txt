                             Take A Look Around
                               Tenchi  Style

                      All the women in my house today
                Only 1 little girl cooking in my house today
                   With the A(Ayeka) fights the R(Ryoko)
                             The R fights the A
                        But I'ma live my life anyway
                     Now all these women really shit it
                                A D+ did it
                       Just because they don't get it
                            But I won't shit it
                             New era committed
              Now this big sword gets a rap from these critics

                         And is Ayeka really right?
                        Why does Ryoko wanna fight?
                            Washu's pretty cute
                            Sasami'sreally cute
                       Kiyone and Mihoshi are always
                              in a big dispute

                       Followed me into the bathroom
                 Remember that, girl, so what you wanna do?
         And where you gonna run when you're starin' up the stairs
               at this sword pointed at your head like a gun,
                           Ryoko is followin' you
                            It's like meso soup
                       when you're down with the flu
            so don't be upset when you're dumped and you're blue
                       Cuz' I'ma be the 1 to kill you

                    (Ryoko) I know why you wanna hate me
            (Ayeka) "   "        "     "        "        "     "
            (Sasami)"   "        "     "        "        "     "
          (Tenchi) Cuz' hate is all the world has even seen lately
                   (Mihoshi) I know why you wanna hate me
           (Kiyone)   "    "       "     "        "       "     "
           (Washu)    "    "       "     "        "       "     "
          (Tenchi) Cuz' hate is all the world has even seen lately
                   (Sakuya) I know why you wanna hate me
           (Nagi)     "   "        "      "        "       "    "
                 (Tenchi) Now I know why you wanna hate me
               CUZ HATE IS ALL THE WORLD HAS EVEN SEEN LATELY
                        (Tenchi sings rest of chorus

                    Does anybody really know the secret
                    Or the story of the Light Hawk Wings
                             And how to get it
                It's kinda sad whenyou don't know da meanin'
                    but everything happens for a reason
                       What should Mihoshi really say
                            Cuz' she's an idiot,
                                  a loser,
                            a microphone abuser
                      I analyze every step thatI make
                   Be nce to Sasami by eating up her cake
                   And Kiyone's a sharpshooter with a gun
                   And Ryoko's a space pirate on the run
                 You can take a ride in Yagami if you want
                      But you cannot be mean to Sasami
                      I know Ayeka wants Ryu- Oh back
                   But she's denied cuz' Washu's a maniac
                       And there and nothin' I can do
                           Cuz' life is a lesson
                     You'll earn it when you're through

                                   Chorus

                        (Tenchi sings rest of song)

                                   THE END
