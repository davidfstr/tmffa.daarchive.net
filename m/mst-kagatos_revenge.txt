--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blackness fills the room, from the darkness steps forth two figures. One
is dressed in dark blue tunic and breeches; a dark blue cape offsets
turquoise blue hair which frames a pale face. He adjusts his leather gloves
as the other figure steps forth.

        The second figure is about the same height as the first. A
magnificent green cape covers a black robe. His greyish hair is brought
back in a ponytail; his white gloves adjust a tiny pair of spectacles on
his pale face. One wonders how his yellow eyes can see out of them.

        The blackness subsides; the two are alone in a theatre. "Well, Magus,
is this where we were supposed to be?" asked the one in the green cape.

        "I believe so," responds the one with turquoise hair.

        "What shall we do?"

        "Wait."

        Suddenly, a big RV appears in the back of the theatre, followed by
a '57 Chevy. A gypsy, clad in black leather, steps out of the RV and looks
around. "This sure doesn't look like New Orleans," he mutters.

        From the '57 Chevy issues forth an aging man. He wears a lab coat
that has been stained by lab chemicals in a psycadelic pattern. Underneath,
the man of about 50 sports a skin-tight uniform of bright blue. However,
his age belies his strength, for he is quite built. He wears white knee-
high boots, and a big plasma cannon is strapped to his back. A gold circlet
peeps out from under white strands of hair.

        The two notice each other and look around, all four seeing each other
at approximately the same time. The aged man levels his plasma cannon, the
green-caped man readies a green energy sword, the turquoise haired one pulls
out a glistening black scythe, and the gypsy pulls out two automatic Glock-18
pistols.

        "My, my, all ready for combat, eh?"

        All four look to the top of the movie screen at the source of the
voice. A man whose eyes are concealed by purple hair, dressed in a white
shirt, brown pants, and a green cape smiles down at them.

        "Now, my good men, no need for violence! Let's introduce ourselves!"
the purple-haired newcomer said while jumping to a front-row seat (making
a perfect landing). "I am the mysterious priest, Xellos!"

        "Very well, I will call truce. I am Magus the Dark, keeper of the
Black Wind," the turquoise-haired man said. He and the green-caped fellow
were both a good foot taller than the others.

        "I am Kagato, former scientific genius," the green-caped one said.

        "I am Marc," the gypsy said, "and if you fuck with me, I'll rock
your world!"

        "I am Dr. Tau," the man in the lab coat said, "I am a scientist!"

<Kagato> (to Tau): Really, Tau? What field?
<Tau> : Don't get me started. I teach quantum theory and I am a master of
        weird science.
<Xellos> : Gentlemen, gentlemen! Take a seat! I have brought you here to
           view a movie!
<Magus> : I'm leaving. (Magus gets up to leave)
<Xellos> (shaking his head) : I'm afraid you won't. I need your help.
<Magus> : How so?
<Xellos> : Someone needs to die, and I must show you why.
<Magus> : Keep talking.
<Xellos> : You must view the movie first.
<Kagato> : Why am I here?
<Xellos> (with an evil grin) : You'll see.
<Marc and Tau> (in unison) : And us??
<Xellos> : You two are gonig to referee. Now then, on with the show!

>It occured to me that Kagato never got his revenge on Tenchi and the others
>for his defeat. Here now is the continuing saga of the evil space villain
>Kagato.....

<Marc> : Didn't Tenchi kill you?
<Kagato> : I thought he did. Say Magus, am I really dead?
<Magus> (checks his lists) : I have you slated here. Yes, I think you are.
<Kagato> : Then how can I get revenge?
<Tau> : Hmmm... someone could have cloned you and brought your spirit back
        to your body utilizing Advanced Spiritual Nonlocation Theory and
        simple cloning...
<Kagato> : Dammit!
<Marc> : What?
<Kagato> : Why do I have to sit next to Washuu over here!
<Tau> (still going on about cloning)
<Others> (sweatdrop)

>                             KAGATO'S REVENGE

<Kagato> : I'm liking this already!
<Xellos> : Just you wait. This is a Sasami lemon.. (pleasantly smiling)
<All ex. Xellos> (turn a little green)

>
>
>by Washu 6/10/97

<Kagato> (surprised) : Boy, I thought Washuu hated me!
<Magus> : That's not your old teacher.
<Kagato> : Oh.
<Others> : SHHHHHHHH!

>  It was a beautiful spring day and Ryo-ohki was bounding through the carrot
>patch with cheerful meows for everyone. Tenchi was busy shovelling dirt

<Tau> : Waitaminute... this isn't "At the Carrot Patch," is it?
<Xellos> : No, that's another viewing for you guys.
<Tau> (still unsure) : Okay...
<Marc> : Dr. Tau, that was one disgusting fic. I'm glad we're not watching
         it. Enough to make me walk out in the sun.
<Others> : Huh?
<Marc> (shows his fangs)
<Others> : Ohh..

>for the new vegitable patch. Sasami and Mihoshi were planting seed
>in the freshly hoed rows of dirt.

<Marc> (evil expression on his face) : I wonder which kind of 'seed'
<Magus> : Tau, you're sitting next to him...
<Tau> (uses superscience to bitch-slap Marc four ways at once)
<Others> : Wow!

>  Sasami looked up from her work and wipped her brow. She took a moment
>to survey the day's accomplishments. She watched Tenchi on the far side
>of the field. He was busy digging. Off in one corner of the garden, Ryoko 
>and Aeka were having a screaming match. Sasami sighed. So what
>else is new? she thought. 

<Kagato> : What the-- how is this revenge?
<Magus> : Shut up before I take you to Hades for a decade.
<Kagato> : Yes sir.

>  Ryo-ohki hopped up with a fresh carrot in her mouth. "Meow, meow,
>meow!!!" she said loudly. Sasami looked down and frowned.

<Tau> : Oh my god! That cabbit is so CUTE!
<Marc> : I could sell those things at a high price!
<Kagato> : I made it!
<Tau> : So can I. Watch! (Tau reaches into his lab coat and pulls out a
        Ryo-Ohki)
<Marc> (Does the same damn thing by reaching into his leather jacket)
<Magus> (summons a cabbit from the Black Wind)
<Kagato> (glares jeasouly at the three)
<Tau> (to Marc) : I didn't know vampires could do that.
<Marc> (chuckles) : Only my clan can.
<Tau> : Oh.

>  "Have you been eating the fresh carrots again Ryo-Ohki?" Tenchi
>won't be very happy about that pleased. Ryo-Ohki looked at her forlornly.

<Magus> : Umm.. he cut off that quote a bit soon...
<Kagato> : Don't nitpick. I want my vengence!
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly)

>  Suddenly, a dark shadow loomed above their heads. Everyone looked up
>to see a giant spacecraft hovering over the field. Without warning,

<Kagato> : YES! I got the Soja back! But I never knew in could go in a
           planet's atmosphere.

>a blast of green light engulfed them all. Tenchi yelled out Sasami's
>name. It was the last thing that Sasami heard before she lost conciousness....
>

<Kagato> : Wait a minute! I had no beef with the little girl!
<Magus> : No kidding.
<Tau> : Shouldn't you have taken Tenchi, Ryoukou, or Washuu?
<Kagato> : They're the ones who destroyed me. Sasami really didn't have
           much to do with it.
<Marc> : You kidding? She pulled out Tsunami, which caused your destruction.
<Kagato> : But, still, Tenchi was at the heart of my death. I think I'd go
           after him first.
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : I think it gets better..
<Others> (silently watch)

>
>  Sasami awoke with a start. Her head was spinning and she felt dazed. She

<Marc> : Yea, I know the feeling. Ever drain a woman when she's climaxing.
         Oh, the blood then is sooo fresh and hot and spicy.
<Tau> : Ever have 4th dimensional sex?
<Kagato> (stays silent)
<Magus> : Actually, yes I have! How about you, Kagato?
<Kagato> (mumbles something)
<Tau> : Come on, Kagato, it's not embarassing to be a virgin.
<Kagato> (throws energy blasts at Tau)
<Tau> (hits a button on his gold belt which causes the energy blasts to
       vanish) : No need to get sore.
<Kagato> (mutters under his breath)
<Marc> (snickers at bit)

>was lying on her back, strapped securely to an operating table. When she

<Tau> : Progenitor lab?
<Marc, Magus, and Kagato> : What's a Progenitor? Why would it have a lab?
<Tau> : Oh. Progenitors are vile, disreputable scientists who seek to...
        (goes into a hour-long speech, but notices various weapons being
        brandished)... oh, sorry. Mostly, evil genetic engineers.
<Marc> : Thank you.

>tried to move her arms, they wouldn't budge. She looked around the room
>in terror, trying to make sense of her predicament. 

<Tau> (nods) : Reminds me of myself whenever my wife Dr. Greenthumb gets
               feeling kinky. I always end up with more bruises than I
               like.
<Others> (glare jealously at Tau)

>  The room was large and white like an operating room. She was confused
>and desperately tried to free her hands.

<Marc> : I don't think she was wearing Sure.
<Tau> : Huh?
<Marc> (singing badly) : Raise your hand if you're Sure!
<Magus> : Marc, do that again and you're coming with me.

>  Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room. "Well Sasami, it seems that I
>will have my revenge at last!" Sasami recognized Kagato's cruel and evil

<Kagato> : Hey! I'm not that cruel and evil! And why the hell am I going
           after Sasami? I should have gotten my vengence on Tenchi, not
           some helpless girl!
<Tau> : Here. (tosses a Chill Pill over Xellos' head to Kagato)
<Kagato> : NO! I'm not gonna settle down!

>voice. She looked around the room in terror and confusion. 

<Marc> : Looking at this last bit, you'd think that the author wanted us
         to know that she was scared.
<Magus> : I guess it's just compounding.
<Tau> : At least we don't see any tenctacles..
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly)

>  A heartless laugh reverberated through the room. "I've been waiting

<All, ex. Xellos> : WHOOOOOOAAAAAA! (the theatre stops shaking when the
                    laugh dies down)
<Marc> : KICKASS! This sound system RULES!
<Tau> : I could make it better..
<Magus> : No kidding, Marc.
<Kagato> : Hell yea!

>for you Sasami..." Kagato cackled. "I've been so looking forward
>to our next encounter!"

<Kagato> : I have never met this girl before! This would be a first
           encounter.
<Marc> (impersonating Clinton) : I have not had sexual relations with that
       woman.
<Tau> : I hope not, Marc. She's only 8.

>   Sasami was terrified. She squirmed and strained against the
>strong clamps that held her wrists and ankles to the table. A

<Tau> : Hey, look! A summary of the last paragraph!

>huge screen descended from the ceiling. On it was as taunting image
>of Kagato's face. His evil glare looked down at her from above.

<Kagato> : I'm not all evil.
<Marc> (impersonating Luke Skywalker) : There's still good in him! I can
        feel it!
<Magus> : What were you doing, Kagato, to taunt her?
<Tau> : Sticking your tongue out?
<Marc> : In a Sasami lemon?
<All, ex. Xellos> (turn a little green)

>  "Now you can see me watching you little one!" he grinned "You will

<Marc> (singly badly) : He knows when you are sleeping, he knows when you're
        awake. He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness
        sake!
<Magus> : I warned you..
<Marc> : Heh heh.. I just couldn't resist.

>be able to see the joy in my face as I submit your young body to
>HELL!" Kagato touched a button and his image was replaced by a mirror

<All ex. Kagato> (back away from Kagato a bit)
<Tau> : You would like that.
<Marc> : Not even I'd go that far!
<Magus> : That's sick!
<Xellos> : No kidding.
<Kagato> : While I wouldn't mind putting Tenchi or Ryoukou or Washuu through
           Hell, I just don't think I could do that to such a sweet girl.
<Magus> : Well, you are.

>reflection of Sasami clamped to the table. "See how pretty you are

<Marc> (Southern accent) : You've got a real purdy mouth.
<Tau> (casually charges up the plasma cannon)
<Marc> : Gulp!
<Tau> : Not in a Sasami lemon, please.

>my dear?" he said with a sarcastic grin. "You can see absolutely
>everyting that is happening to you."

<Magus> : I thought she was supposed to see Kagato's joy at torturing her.
<Marc> : Kagato, you're one sick fuck!
<Kagato> : I am not the man in the fic!
<Tau> : Creative license?
<Magus> : I'm gonna revoke Washu's creative license..
<Kagato> : Good luck.
<Magus> : No, not Washuu, but Washu. This author of this fic?

>  Without warning, the wall at her left opened up and a cluster of evil
>looking machinery slid forth from the darkness. The mechanical nightmare

<Tau> (turning a little green) : This had better not be.
<Marc> (turnnig green as well) : Oh, God...
<Kagato> (turning green) : No, no...
<Magus> (just a little green) : No tentacles, please...
<Greenthumb> : HI! (steps out of another '57 Chevy. She is dressed in a
               green-stained lab coat, underneath of which she wears the
               same form-fitting bright blue suit, with green knee-high
               boots. She looks to be 25 at most, with long brown hair.)
<Tau> (suddenly looks about 23. He is much more buff, and has long blonde
       hair.) : Greenthumb! Come join us! (he gets up to meet Greenthumb.
       They kiss and both snap their fingers, turning them naked. They
       start having sex right there.)
<Xellos> (annoyed, points at the screen. The picture pauses)
<Marc> : Reminds me of.. ME!
<Magus> : Could you hurry it up?
<Xellos> : We have a movie to watch.
<Kagato> (blushes at the sight)
<Marc> : How'd she get here, anyway?
<Magus> : We all turned green.
<Kagato> : That's pretty lame.
<Xellos> : Either way, she's here.
<Tau and Greenthumb> (they get done after 5 minutes, neither one looking too
                     satisfied. Marc sits by Xellos so that they can sit
                     together.)
<Xellos> (points at the screen again)
<Greenthumb> : What are we watching?
<Tau> : Kagato's Revenge.
<Greenthumb> : Oh.

>hummed to life as Kagato pushed the buttons on his controller madly.

<Magus> : Just one more stage..

>  Sasami gasped in horror as she watched metallic tentacles writh and

<All, ex. Xellos> : NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
<Tau> (turning quite green) : In the name of Science, GO AWAY!
<Marc> : Please, Xellos, stop the movie!
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly) : But it's good so far! Such plot!
<Others> (continue to turn shades of green)

>twitch as the machinery unfolded above her. Silvery metal tentacles
>with various probes and needles moved into place above the operating
>table. One of the evil metal worms boasted a horrific electric sawblade
>which hummed quietly. Sasami shuddered in terror.

<Greenthumb> : I don't like the looks of this...
<Others> (nod in agreement)
<Kagato> : Maybe he'll just cut her and inject pain-causing agents into
           her. Maybe the lemon part is later on, like back on Earth.
<Marc> : You mean like "At the Carrot Patch"?
<Kagato> : At least there wouldn't be any tentacles.

>  Kagato laughed insanely as the torture tentacles hovered over Sasami.

<Magus> : Are you insane, Kagato?
<Kagato> : Well, I let power get to my head once.
<Tau> : Not your fault.
<Greenthumb> : That doesn't make you insane. Wait a minute, I thought you
               were dead!
<Kagato> : I am! I'm with him. (points to Magus)
<Greenthumb> (frenches Magus) : How do you do? I'm Dr. Greenthumb, super-
             scientist!
<Magus> (smiling happily) : Pleasure's all mine.. Magus the Dark, keeper
        of the Black Wind.

>  "Now you will see what pain and torment really mean!" he cackled
>sadistically. Sasami's eyes welled up with tears and frustration.

<Tau> : I thought Aeka was the sadist.
<Marc> (licking his lips) : I can just taste her fear. MMMmmmMMMmmm....
<Others, inc. Xellos> : WHAT??
<Marc> (cleaning one extended fang with his tongue) : The blood of a
        fearful child has such texture..
<Others, inc. Xellos> : Ewwww.. sick!

>  "Please let me go!!" she begged. Kagato just smirked and glared
>at her evily.

<Kagato> : Why can't I ever do anything normally! Why must I always have
           sick, twisted motives behind every smile!
<Greenthumb> (to the others) : He's a virgin, isn't he.
<Others, ex. Kagato> : Yup.
<Greenthumb> : Wait til after the show, Kagato!
<Kagato> : Erk! (glance over at Greenthumb. Tau has a look of "Oh, God, here
           she goes again" on his face)

>  "Not until you've paid the price for my defeat at the hands of your
>friends!" 

<Magus> : THE FUCK?! No way that Kagato would go after Sasami over something
          that Tenchi did!
<Kagato> : No kidding! Tenchi should be up there, in a fair fight!

>   Sasami whimpered aprehensively as she watched the torture tentacles

<Tau> : At least this author has a good vocabulary.
<Marc> : Small positive note compared to the OOCness of this.
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly)

>squirm above her. Kagato pressed a button on his control pad and suddenly
>the silver tentacles came to life. Sasami gasped in horror as a tentacle
>descended to the table where she was held captive. At the tip of the tentacle
>was what seemed to be a tiny sawblade.

<Tau> (very green) : That would hurt like a sonovabitch..
<Marc> : How would you know?
<Tau> : You've never changed your gender?
<Magus> : You can't change your gender like you change your clothes!
<Greenthumb> : We can and do. Of course, we prefer our original genders, but
               it's fun to play!
<Kagato> (to Magus) : They are a couple of weird-ass folks.
<Magus> (nods)

>   As Sasami watched in horror, the blade began to rotate faster and faster
>until a loud hum emminated from the cruel device. The tentacle suddenly 

<Tau and Greenthumb> : No, no, no...

>moved lower down on her body and out of Sasami's line of sight. Her eyes

<Tau and Greenthumb> : Oh my God...
<Magus> (realizes what they are talking about) : It had better not be...
<Marc> (shakes his head) : That would be torture.

>grew wide in terror and she clenched her fists together in anticipation
>of what was going to happen.

(barf bags decend from the ceiling "in anticipation of what was going to
happen")

>   She yelped aloud as she heared the sound of the blade begin cutting into
>the fabric of her pretty blue dress. She shook her head violently in 

<All, ex. Kagato> : WHEW!
<Magus> : Raping by sawblade.. (shudders)
<Tau> : There's still more tenctacles, though.
<All> : Ewwww...

>desperate protest. The tentacle slowly eased the sawblade up her thigh,
>rending the delecate fabric of her clothes. 

<Greenthumb> : It ain't over yet.
<Marc> : I know it won't..
<Magus> : It had better not..
<Kagato> : It's not me! I swear!

>   Through tears in her eyes, Sasami saw another tentacle descend from
>the metallic cluster hovering above her. The new metal worm had shiny

<Tau> : No way.. unh-unh.

>grippers like pointed pinchers attached to the end of it. The vile
>looking pointed fingers of the gripper opened and closed mennacingly
>with a metallic click. 

<Magus> : Astounding..
<Tau> : What?
<Magus> : A Sasami lemon writer actually using the thesaurus.

>   The sawblade slowly worked its way up to Sasami's waist. Every few
>inches, it made a little nick in her flesh causing her to cry out.

<Marc> : I think it's gonna...
<Kagato> : I wouldn't dare...

>As the blade reached her pretty belt, it viciously sawwed into it
>slicing the fabric in two.

<Tau> : Viciously sawed a belt?
<Magus> : I just can't see a belt being viciously sawed.

>   Sasami could feel the sting of the mini cuts that the spinning
>blade had caused on her soft thighs. Her tears of pain and fright
>poured down the sides of her face.

<Greenthumb> : Descriptive...too descriptive...

>   The gripper tentacle clasped her shredded blue dress and slowly
>pulled the two halves apart revealing what was underneath. Sasami's
>lacy blue panties were exposed now. Here beautiful young legs showed

<All> : NOOO!!
<Magus> : A sight I did NOT need to see!
<Tau> : As horrifying as the Mihoshi GP story.
<Kagato> : She's only 8!
<Greenthumb> : I do not like the way this is going..
<Marc> : Hmm.. if all 8 year old girls look like this (licks his lips)
<Tau> (reveals an odd gun on his wrist) : Marc, that's sick! I ought to
        take you down for that one! Turn you into a lawnchair or something.
<Marc> : Settle down, Tau. I was just joking.

>the tiny cuts inflicted by the sawblade. Little trickles of blood
>ran down the sides of her thighs from the many small wounds.

<Marc> (upon seeing the blood, begins to shake) : Looks.. so.. nummy..

>   Sasami's cheeks grew flushed as Kagato eyed her bare legs.

<Magus> : Kagato, you are one sick bastard. About as sick as the pedophile
          Vampire gypsy over there.
<Kagato> : It wasn't me!

>"What a pretty young thing you are.." he cackled. "The very thought
>of defiling your flesh makes my heart soar!" He continued pressing

<All> (turn green)
<Marc> (stops shaking) : This is really sick..

>buttons on his controller and more tentacles descended from the
>mechanical cluster of evil.

<Tau> : NOOOOO!!! (gets his barf bag ready)

>   The sawblade tentacle began cutting up Sasami's delecate blouse.
>She cried out as the blade cut viciously into the tender flesh of

<Kagato> : Now, it wouldn't be so bad if he disemboweled her. Of course, it
           should be Tenchi getting disemboweled.
<Greenthumb> : Bitter, Kagato?
<Kagato> : Damn straight.

>fabric and exposing more of her soft flesh to the eyes of her
>tormentor.

<Magus> : Oh, no...

>    Sasami's tears welled to weeping as she sobbed in frustration
>and terror. The sawblade finished its vile work and the gripper
>stripped her of the last remnant of her shredded outer clothing.

<Marc> (turning green) : This is why I never went pedo..
<Magus> : This is sick. Xellos, why?
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : Well, it's all following my plan, basically.

>    Kagato watched in delight as Sasami blushed and struggled.
>Her lacy blue bra was exposed now, hiding her budding young breats.

<Tau> : Puberty at eight? A bit young...
<Magus> : Some authors put Sasami at 12.
<Tau> : That'd make more sense..
<Marc> (quite green) : Doesn't help much..

>She looked up at Kagato's taunting image on the screen above her.
>Sasami felt ashamed at her bareness and her cheeks flushed as she
>tried to turn away from his gaze.

<Kagato> : DAMMIT! Why can't I just be a regular old evil guy? Why must I
           always be some sick, demented psycho freak out to do horrid
           acts?
<Magus> : Because it's easy.
<Tau> : It's fun.
<Marc> : For $100,000 I'll get them to stop.

>    A metal probe criss-crossed her upper body, poking at her young

<Greenthumb> : Owie.. good thing I don't wear a bra.

<Magus> : Tau, you're a lucky man..
<Tau> (hugging GT) : Don't I know it!

<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : Come on, the fun has yet to start.

>her cheeks grew red in embarrassment.

<GT> : Hmm, an eight year old being exposed to a sicko.. yea, embarassment
       would be included..

>    More metallic tentacles carressed her neck and wrapped around

<Tau> : Yep. Right there. Trauma.

>    Other evil metal worms were getting to work on her lower half.

<Tau> : NOOO!

>Cold probes of steel were wrapping themselves around Sasami's bare
>legs. They slithered and wriggled around her thighs, wrapping her
>pretty legs tightly. To her horror, the tentacles began to pull
>Sasami's legs apart, spreading her thighs and exposing the crotch
>of her lacy blue panties.

<All> : ARGH!
<Tau> : Can't hold back... (barfs into his bag)
<Marc> : Ugh.. pedophilia BAD..
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly)

>   Sasami cried out "Oh NO!" as the naughty worms held her legs
>open for Kagato to admire. "Please... oh please!" she begged.

<Magus> (notices Kagato about to explode) : This Kagato is not admiring
        anything but the barf bag.
<Others, ex. Xellos> : Neither are we.
<Greenthumb> : Please end this! This is horrible!
<Kagato> : Just kill her! Be merciful!
<Marc> : Jesus..

>   "Quiet now lovely one..." Kagato whispered. His image on the

>with a look of pure hate.

<All, ex. Xellos> (Glare at the screen with a look of pure hate)

<Greenthumb> : I think it is...
<Marc> : I hate naughty tenctacles...

>a lifelike way, then suddenly plunged into her mouth without

>young mouth. She clutched at her bonds in horror as the silver
>worm violently penetrated her throught.

<Magus> (falls apart, literally)
<Kagato> (power pukes into the bag)
<Marc> : Dammit, Magus fell apart.

>   Sasami's warm saliva coated the tentacle, making it slippery
>and warm. It plunged down her throught, raping her mouth slowly

<Marc> (tosses it into the barf bag)

>with metal. Sasami gagged and fought against it, but the tentacle

<Tau> : How can she breathe?
<Greenthumb> : I don't think that the author was concerned about that point.

>   The tentacles at the lower half of her body kept her legs
>tightly spread as new probes positioned themselves infront of
>Sasami's exposed crotch. A tentacle slipped under the lacy

<Magus> (rematerializes from the Black Wind as the bits of him that fell
         apart vanish) : I hate it when I do that.
<Tau> : This isn't good!

>blue elastic of her panties and squirmed over her virgin
>pussy. Sasami arched her back in protest as more tentacles
>slipped under her panties and probed her female secrets.

<GT> : SICK!
<Marc> : Kagato, you are one sick fuck!
<Kagato> : It wasn't me!

>   One of the tentacles exerted force on the satin fabric
>of her panties and the lacy garment ripped open, exposing
>her soft bush of blue pubic hair. A tentacle rubbed over

<All, ex. Xellos> : ARRRRGH!

>her pussy, pressing against her little clit and causing
>Sasami to moan softly.

<Tau> : I don't think little kids can get that kind of pleasure.

>    The tentacles spread her legs wider and opened her
>pussy to more exploration. A metal worm gently carressed her
>soft clit, sending tingles through Sasami's body. It
>rubbed back and forth against her little nub, causing
>her clit to swell and burn with pleasure. 

<Kagato> : Can't hold it in.. (barfs again)

>   Sasami tried to cry out, but the slippery metal phallus
>in her mouth prevented her from screaming. She gagged
>slowly as the worm continued to rape her tight throat.

<Tau> : At least he has his story straight.
<Marc> : Small consolation.

>   The tentacles below held her legs tightly as the
>metal worm continued its onslaught on Sasami's virgin
>clit. A trickle of vaginal fluid was slowly coating
>Sasami's young pussy. The metal worms became slippery
>and warm as they slipped back and forth across her 
>damp bush. 

<Marc> : I'm traumatized! Gonna go for Golconda. I'll change my evil ways!
<GT> : Tau, don't build any naughty tentacles, ever.
<Tau> : I won't. Believe me..

>   Two tentacles pressed against her pussy lips, spreading
>them open and exposing her vagina to the intruding worms.

<Magus> : MORE THAN WE NEEDED TO KNOW!

>A tentacle gently carressed the her pussy and Sasami squirmed
>in frustration. The tentacle slipped inside her and began
>to probe the interior of her virgin pussy. It thrust into
>her more violently and began to writhe and pump itself 
>faster and faster.

<Marc> : Yay.. rape/torture of small girl.. Xellos, why the hell did you
         bring us here!
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly, not even a little green) : It's a secret!
(several attacks fly at Xellos; all are repelled)
<Xellos> : It's really no use, see?

>   Suddenly, Sasami noticed that the tentacles inside of
>her were growing increasingly warm. The one raping her pussy
>began to slide in and out of her wetly. It's slippery metal
>squirmed and pumped her pussy with viciousness. It penetrated
>her deeply, exploring the far recesses of her vagina with each
>thrust. It tickled her cervix, causing a spasm in Sasami's
>lower half.

<Tau> : Just how big are these tenctacles?
<Magus> : Like it matters?
<Marc> : It's sick either way.
<Kagato> : It wasn't me..

>    The tentacle raping her mouth was getting warm as well.
>It heated up her tongue as it quickly thrust against the
>back of her throat. The tentacle was slimey and wet with
>her saliva and tasted metallic. It made Sasami wince and gag.

<Magus> : Kagato, I should have annihilated you.
<Kagato> : That's not me! Someone else is using me in this horrible way!
           I feel so violated!

>    A new tentacle pushed its way inside her pussy, coming

<GT> : I don't fucking think so! Not without several damage to Sasami's
        vagina regions!
<Tau> : Maybe she'll die from internal bleeding.
<Marc> : Then she can rest.

>alongside the first one. Sasami arched her back in torment
>as her pussy was stretched widely. The first vaginal tentacle
>had begun to wriggle inside her womb, pushing past her cervix
>and violating her womanhood profanely. It squeezed into
>her womb violently and explored the dark recesses of her flesh.

<Tau> : Well, she'll never have kids..
<GT> : If she survives all the internal bleeding.
<Magus> : I need to go gather Sasami's soul.
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : Stay here until the show is over, please.
<Magus> (sits down, grumbling)

>   The second tentacle inside her pussy continued pumping and

<Tau> : I don't think an eight-year-old's vagina can stretch that far.
<Kagato> : Since when are you an expert on eight-year-old sexual organs?
<Tau> : Well, ever since I became a medical doctor!
<Kagato> : Oh.

>writhing as a new metal worm placed its pinchers on Sasami's
>clit. It grasped the little pink nub tightly and began to
>vibrate with an electric hum. 

<Marc> : Could be worse. I mean, it's bad, but still..
<Magus> : I know what you mean. Gotta look on the bright side, right? After
          all, I can't commit suicide. I'd be sending my soul to myself. If
          I did.. (shudder)

>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as pleasure burned through her clit.
>In spite of the violent metallic torture, the clit vibrator

<GT> : I don't think that a little pleasure is gonna make her forget the
        mind-scarring pain she's facing here. You men have no idea how
        sensitive these parts are!

>was sending tingles through her whole body. It pressed against
>her clit, holding itself tightly against Sasami's virgin nub.

<Magus> : Another superfluous statement.
<Kagato> : This whole damned thing is superfluous! I really wish this story
           was about me beating the shit out of Tenchi.

>   Soon, she felt a hot flash of pleasure ripple through her
>pussy. She gasped and arched as tingles vibrated through her
>lower half. The tentacle raping her mouth withdrew itself slowly
>from her violated throat. As it escaped her lips, it left a hot
>trail of sticky saliva in its wake.

<Marc> : Too much mental imagery (pukes blood into the barf bag)
<Tau> : Dude, you don't look so good. I mean, you're puking *blood*
<Marc> : I'm a vampire, remember?
<Tau> : Oh, yea.

>   Sasami gasped for breath and moaned aloud. She writhed and
>arched her back as the vibrating tentacle nailed her little
>clit. "Oh...ooooooo.." she moaned in frustration. She closed
>her eyes tightly and clenched her fists. Wave after wave of
>burning pleasure tore through her clit and she cried out.

<Tau> : Really.. it's gotten so bad that it's not quite as bad..
<GT> (green as her name) : Speak for yourself.

>  "Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...!!!!" she moaned as her pussy spasmed
>with pleasure. Her clit burned in a white-hot climax as the
>tentacles inside her grew slippery and wet with her female
>juices.

<Tau> (turning green) : Spoke too soon..
<GT> (blows chunks)

>   Sasami shuddered and sighed deeply as her climax subsided.
>She went limp and the tentacle removed the vibrating clamp from
>her clit.

<Kagato> (glimmer of hope) : She's gonna pass out! She's spared!
<All, ex. Xellos> : YAY YAY!
<Xellos> (Smiling pleasantly) : It's not that bad, you guys. Very interesting
         ideas. Brilliant plot line.
<All, ex. Xellos> (back away at least 5 meters from Xellos)

>    Kagato grinned on the screen above. Through her tears,
>Sasami could see his evil smile. "Are you ready to taste
>true torture?" he asked wickedly. Sasami moaned and sighed

<All, ex. Xellos> : NO WE ARE NOT READY!

>as the tentacles inside her continued to rape her young body.

<Tau> : I think the blood loss would have induced loss of consciousness.
<GT> : By my calculations, she'd be dead.
<Kagato> (to Xellos) : You invited those scientist types. They're as bad as
                        Washuu.

>Kagato pressed a key on his touchpad and all hell broke lose.

<Magus> : OH SHIT! (rushes into the Black Wind and comes out after 5 seconds)
          Hell has not broken loose! Never joke about that!

>    More metallic tentacles descended from the cluster above
>Sasami's table. The new ones were equiped with unimaginable

<Tau> : Thank god we can't imagine them. But these tentacles must go.

>devices of torture. Phalluses of every shape and size. Long

<Tau> : Hey! You said we couldn't imagine them! NO FAIR!

>needles and blades that were shiny and viciously sharp.

<Marc> : Boy, Kagato, you never give a girl a break!
<GT> : But you sure give a girl a breakdown. Our rendevous is cancelled!
<Tau> (looks surprised and shocked)
<Magus> : First time she's turned someone down?
<Tau> : I wagered that I'd be first to turn someone down.

>   Sasami's eyes grew wide as she watched the torture tentacles
>descend to her body. They encircled her with their twisted 
>devices and slowly nodded at her as if to taunt her with
>lust and torture.

<Tau> : It's too horrible for words..
<Magus> : At least Sasami isn't being tortured in an uncomfortable place.
<All, ex. Magus> (in unison) : What, in the back of the Volkswagen?
<Magus> (sweatdrops) : Not exactly..

>   Two tentacles with nasty looking clamps descended on her
>breasts. The clamps fit perfectly around Sasami's hard pink
>nipples. She looked up at the screen above her and watched
>in horrific anticipation of what would happen.

<GT> : I don't like the looks of this...

>   Without warning, two sharp steel spikes pierced her nipples.

<GT> : AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!! (cringes, crossing
        both arms in front of her breats)

>Sasami screamed out loud and tensed her muscles in agony. The
>clamps inserted a long steel nail into each nipple and blood 
>gushed from the puncture wounds. The tentacles rose from her
>chest, leaving the two silver spikes inserted into her breasts.

<Tau> : Ugh.. (heaves it into the barf bag)
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : Hmmmm, there's a thought!
<Magus> : What?
<Xellos> : That, is a secret!

>    The silver nails stung terribly and Sasami moaned in pain and

<GT> : NO SHIT THOSE FUCKERS WOULD "STING TERRIBLY"! FUCKING HURT LIKE
       BLOODY HELL THEY WOULD! NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO
       THIS AUTHOR!

>confusion. Another tentacle like the first two descended to
>her spread pussy. It clamped down on her clit and squeezed.

<GT> (chi-glow emanating) : No way in bloody hell...

>Sasami squirmed violently and the tentacles held her tight.
>The tentacle clamp pierced Sasami's clit with a silver steel
>nail just like the ones that punctured her breats.

<GT> (faints)
<Others, ex. Xellos> : Ooooooooo.. that had to hurt! (all four wince)

>   "AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!"Sasami screamed at the top of her lungs

<GT> (wakes up)

>as a feeling like fire burned her clit. The pain was 
>excrusiating. 

<GT> : NOT AS EXCRUSIATING AS PAIN YOU WILL FEEL WHENEVER I COME FOR YOU,
        SICKO!
<Others, inc. Xellos> (back far away from Kagato)
<Kagato> : Hold off, ma'am..
<GT> (launches a biomorphic attack on Kagato, changing his gender, then
      throws three spikes at super-science speed at Kagato, hitting him
      at all three locations exactly) 
<Kagato> (dies)

>   Suddenly, her restraints we unlocked and her hands came free

<Tau> : Hey, we unlocked the restraints! Let's get this poor girl out of
        here!

>from the table. The tentacles held her tightly in their grip
>and slowly turned her over onto her stomach. Sasami struggled
>and fought with the metal worms, but whe was held fast.

<Tau> : Uh oh, this looketh not good!
<GT> (notices screen, turns green, gets barf bag out)

>   She moaned as she lay face down on the table. Her cheek sat 
>in a little pool of a mixture of her own blood and saliva. The 

<Marc> : Blood, blood, BLOOD! (starts to freak out)

>clamps locked her wrists and ankles again, keeping her trapped
>to the torture table. A tentacle wrapped itself around her waist 
>and lifted her ass into the air while forcing her head to lie on 
>the table. The soft flesh of her young ass was bare and exposed
>to the tentacles now. 

<Marc> : Barf, barf, BARF! (gets out the bag)

>   Two of them spread her ass cheeks and held them open to attack.

<Tau> : Not cool...
<Magus> : Ugh...
<Kagato> (steps from Black Wind, looks at screen, pulls out bag)

>A third vibrating phallus slipped wetly across Sasami's back.

<GT> : The hell it did.

>She moaned in pain and exhaustion, nearly unconcious and feeling

<Tau> : Kill her already! Quit this horrid torture!

>the painful burning sting of the steel needles in her nipples
>and clit.

<GT> (covers those spots and grimaces) : About like having your scrotum
        pierced twice and the phallus pierced.
<Others, ex. Xellos> (grimace painfully and moan)
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : I've had worse.

>  The snake-like metal probe tickled her exposed asshole and
>slowly began to penetrate Sasami's back door. She winced in

<GT> (tosses it away, right into the bag)

>pain as it slipped wetly into her tight ass, probing and
>tickling all the way. It writhed and squirmed inside her
>colon, pushing in farther and farther. 

<Tau> : Evil naughty tenctacles B-- (blows chunks all on the screen,
        which are repelled by force field)

>  Sasami's cheeks flushed redly. She was so tired and hurt,
>but she still knew that Kagato was watching her rape-torture
>and loving every second.

<All ex. Xellos> (glare at Kagato)
<Kagato> (sweatdrops) : Umm.. that's not me.

>   The anal tentacle rape continued as the worm explored deeper
>into her cavaties. It reamed and pumped her tight ass as blood

<All ex. Xellos> (continue to glare to Kagato)
<Kagato> (multi-drops) : Umm..err.. really. Not me. Someone.. else?

>trickled down her thighs from her torn anus. Sasami sighed
>deeply and moaned, eyes half shut. 

<All ex. Xellos> (begin to growl)
<Kagato> (hides behind sweatdrop) : I'd just go after Tenchi, personally.

>   The tentacle began to vibrate and pump her ass with greater
>speed. More tentacles went to work on Sasami, poking at the
>steel spikes in her nipples, causing her to wince. Tears 

<GT> (winces in unison with poor Sasami)

>welled at her eyes and she yelped as a vibrating clamp attached
>itself to the clit spike and began to torture her pierced flesh.

<Marc> (powerpukes into bag)

>   Her clit felf like it was on fire as the clamp vibrated the
>clit spike. Her nipples burned redly as the vibro-clamps tortured

<GT> (starts shaking)

>her soft tits. A small stream of blood droplets trickled from her
>impaled, violated tits. A red pool was collecting beneath her on 
>the torture table.

<Tau> : Poor girl. Magus, hold her close.
<Magus> : She will have a good afterlife, unlike some scum.

>   The anal tentacle thrust deeply into her and out again, making

<GT> (shakily holds up fist) : I've got something to thrust deeply into
        this author's face.
<Others, ex. Xellos> (nod in agreement)

>Sasami squeal and clutch at the table. The clit clamp vibrated
>faster, sending hot flashes of pain and pleasure through her body.

<Marc> : What pleasure can she be feeling?

>Her nipples burned and ached as the clamps twisted the needles
>inside her. She screamed again as the needles twisted and rotated.

<GT> : ARGH!! It's horrifying! Make it stop! Make it stop!

>Sasami was in terrible agony. Her little tits felt like they
>were on fire. 

<GT> : NO, it's WORSE!

>   She felt her clit burn with screaming pleasure as the tentacle
>clamp vibrated the clit needle. Her pussy spasmed and her anus
>contracted, squeezing the tentacle in her ass. She felt herself
>drifting off, losing concious control and seperating herself from
>her own body. 

<Magus> : I'll be back.
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : No, you will stay here. You may leave when
        it's done.

>   Her clit screamed with pleasure as the vibration continued.
>She closed her eyes, lifted her head and moaned softly. She arched 
>her back and cried out "OOOOOoooohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!" as she climaxed 
>violently.

<GT> (very green) : No way I could climax while in such pain.
<Tau> : Who could?
<Magus> : No one I know.
<Kagato> : Me neither.
<Xellos> (smiles pleasantly)
<Marc> : I know a few.

>   The tentacle in her ass twisted and pumped, insulting her tight
>asshole as her hot orgasm tore through her. The tentacle clamps
>pulled viciously at her nipple piercings, stretching her young
>blood-stained tits. As Sasami screamed in orgasm and pain,

<All, ex. Xellos> : ARGH! That's... that's... ARGH!

>the tentacle clamps powerfully yanked the nipple needles from
>her tits. They violently ripped from her nipples, tearing huge, deep
>gashes in her tits as they exited her flesh.

<All males, inc. Xellos> : OooooOOOOooo!!! DAMN!
<GT> : AAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
       (clenches breasts) AARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!

>   Sasami gasped and gagged in pain as her screaming orgasm
>subsided. Her breasts hurt like the devil. Blood cascaded 

<GT> : NO SHIT THEY "HURT LIKE THE DEVIL"! I'LL SHOW YOU HER PAIN SHOULD
       WE EVER MEET! YOU'RE BODY WILL HURT LIHE THE GODDAM DEVIL!

>from her chest and covered the table below her. She sighed
>deeply, then collapsed into unconciousness....

<Tau> : THANK GOD! THANK YOU, THE POWERS THAT BE!
<Magus> : It's over. She is to have her peace now.
<Xellos> (smiling pleasantly) : Not yet, Magus.

>  Kagato smiled and retracted the tentacles from her body. The slimey

<Kagato> : Okay, that fucking does it. If they think that this is my way
           of getting revenge, they'll get it!
<Magus> : He's flipped out!

<Marc> : Truly a waste...
