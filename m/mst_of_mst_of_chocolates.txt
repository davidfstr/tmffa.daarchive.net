<Author's notes: I found this MST awhile back and
decided to counter MST it. Donny's fics are really
good (At least in my opinion) and thus must be
defended to the death. I do intend to write a
separate MST of the original story. ^^>

<Our Quarrelsome Quartet enter: The Bard, Shadow,
Rowan, and the Guardian>

Bard: We're back...

Shadow: And still not getting paid...

Rowan: Knock it off you two! You guys sound like MSTers!

<Author sweatdrops>
<"Ahehe....no offense meant by that comment!">

Guardian: Anyway, this time we're doing to do a MST
          of a MST, since Shade still isn't ready
          and he feels that he needs to build up his
          experience level before AMN is opened.
          So here we are.

Shadow: *Receive 200 XP for MST, Level Up!*

Guardian: Okay...who let him play all of the Final
          Fantasy series again?

Bard & Rowan: We plead the fifth.

(And now for something completely different)

<The guys take their seats>

>Chocolates, chocolates, and more chocolates...

<All> Mmmm....chocolate.

>WRITTEN BY: Donny Cheng

<All>: <Cheering>

>MSTIED BY: Jamie Jeans a.k.a. JOLT!!!

Bard: Eww.....Jam on jeans....messy.

Shadow: I prefer something without caffeine.

Rowan & Guardian: Ditto.

>I am finally at my twenty-ninth fanfic and boy,

Guardian: and boy are my arms tired!

<Quick spotlight on a cabbit with a drumset>
<Ryo-ohki plays a rimshot>

Rowan: That was bad....

Bard & Shadow: No kidding.

>does it feel good to get off that A-ko fanfic.
 I think I can get my thirtieth MSTied fanfic
 done before the first of June. Wish me luck!

Shadow: Should we?

<All>: Naaahh....

>LEGAL STUFF: All the Anime characters in the following
>MST belongs to the talented and creative people who

>your characters and not making any claim on them. The Club
>Anipike belongs to Nightbreak, whom I am grateful to for

Rowan: Well at least she’s covered herself.

>Now, on to the show!

Bard: When last we left our hero Ash...*BAP*....ow.....

Guardian: <Puts mallet away> NO POKEMON!!!

Rowan: He’s seen too much of Team Rocket.
>________________________________________________________

Shadow: “It’s dead Jim.”

Guardian: Does that mean we can leave?

Rowan: No.

Shadow & Guardian: Damn!

>   The Club Anipike was jumping with customers
    as various people,

Bard: (Club Anipike) Jump with me now customers!

>coming in from the break in

Shadow: Ah...Good ol’ Ryoko.

>between the first and second rounds of the Author
>Avatar Tournament.

<All>: Huh???

Guardian: You....you......you mean that they actually
          are proud of doing that?!?!?!!!

<Bard and Shadow make gagging sounds>

> Not only were there people from many various Anime
> shows, but several MSTiers were there as well.

Bard: Hey! Nobody invited us!!! I hate missing a good party!

Rowan: Be thankful for small favors.

> On several large screen TVs were replays of the first
> eight matches as well as interviews with many of the
> self-inserted characters.

Bard: How do you self insert yourself? Isn’t that
      anatomically impossible?

*WHAM**CRUSH**BAP*

<The other three put away their non-lethal Hentai
 control devices>

Shadow: That was sick.

Rowan: Coming from you that’s pretty bad.

>One of the screens was currently replaying the footage
>of Samantha Jones Ki blasting Adam Chris Leigh during
>his interview with Michael Cole.

<All>: Blatent SI!!!

 And thus did the mighty Guardian and Shadow use the
 holy thermonuclear GU-233 space modulator to destroy
 the evil avatars. And there was much rejoicing.

<Bored Peasants>: yay.

(HEY!!! Get away from my keyboard you two!!!)

Shadow & Guardian: Damn....almost worked.

Bard: If we have to suffer, so do you.

>        Misato and Jotouro were working overtime
>as they attempted to meet the orders of everyone at the
>Club Anipike even as C-ko and Akane were cooking up a
>storm in the kitchen.

<All> 0_0.................AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bard: (Pale) The horror....the unspeakable horror......

Rowan: If I were religious I’d be praying now.

Guardian: (In Shock) The worst cooks in the Aniverse........in one
kitchen....

Shadow: It’s a little too late to pray....time to bend over
        and kiss your butt goodbye.

>Shouting out, Misato caught the attention of Mihoshi
>and Aeka, directing them to help out in the kitchen.

<All>: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

Shadow: I can understand Mihoshi....but AYEKA!?!?!

Guardian: Terrible doesn’t even begin to describe her cooking.

Bard: She thinks whipping the cream is a Jurian wedding ritual.

Rowan: Let’s not even think about her version of beating the eggs........

<All four involuntarily cross their legs at that>

>        "You gotta remain calm," a young man was speaking
>to a beautiful redhead.  "Remain calm? That *jerk* kept
>on insulting Mihoshi for no god damned reason," Samantha
>Jones shouted back. The two were seated across from each other

Guardian: At least she’s defending the goddess Mihoshi.

Rowan: Maybe this won’t be so bad.

<All four think about that possibilty for a moment>

<All>: Naahh....

>        "And if A-ko and Ryouko hadn't been there,
>you would have killed him," Washu said, coming up
>from behind her and taking a seat.

Bard: (Washu) My seat! Mine Mine Mine!!!

Rowan: You know Washu-chan’s going to make you pay for that....

<A Tanuki Statue appears and smashes the Bard>

Bard:........********........

Rowan: Told ya.

Guardian: (Reading a note on the statue)
         ‘Got that right! Just because I’m working on
          the AMN doesn’t mean I haven’t been keeping
          track of my little guinea pigs. Don’t forget,
          I still have to do your physicals!
         -The Greatest Kawaii Genius in the Universe’

Shadow: Uh oh....not again!!!

Rowan: What’s worse then seeing Little Washu in a nurse’s outfit?

Guardian: Seeing Minako in one.

Shadow: And what’s worse then that?

Bard: Seeing Urd in one.

Rowan: (Impressed whistle) Talk about quick recovery...

Bard: <Shrugs> Good hentais never die, we just get more compact.

>    "Hi Washu," the man said.
>    "Hello Jamie. You getting a drink too?"
>    Jamie swished the remainder of his drink around
>before setting the glass down. "Just some pop, Washu.
>I can't handle anything stronger."

Shadow: (Ranma) Ah, so you like to beat up Genma too.

> Looking over her, he saw a familiar face and got up.
>"Look, I'm gonna talk with some friends for a little bit.
>I'll catch you later."

Rowan: What is she, a bug collection?

>        The two redheads watched him go and caught
>little pieces of his conversation.

Guardian: I caught an “I”!

Bard: I’ll trade you for an “and”

  >      "How you getting on, Seth?"

Rowan: I don’t think it’s that kind of a fic.

    >    "Just great, Jamie. You meet Megane yet?"

Bard: Who?

Shadow: 6.7, a real twisted author and MSTer

Bard: Oh...that Megane.

      >  "Oh my god! It's a pleasure to meet you!"

       Shadow: Mihoshi meets Kami-sama.

        > "Same here..."

       Rowan: If they’re all the same what’s the point?

        > "Hey, Timothy, come on over here!"

        Guardian: Not going to even touch that one.

         > "Yeah, what is it Michael? Oh hi, Jamie.
         > What are you doing here?"

        Shadow: Welcome to a Clueless Anime fusion.

        Guardian: (Preppie) Like fer sure....*CLONG*

        Bard: <Puts away lute> That’s enough of that.

>        "Same as you. Just getting a drink and
>awaiting the second round of the AA Tournament..."

Shadow: Yes, Alcoholics Anonymous has become the latest sport.

Bard: Get drunk, then see who’s fastest to the emergency room.

>       The two characters tuned out the talk and concentrated
>on their drinks. "that was a good Ki blast, Samantha," Washu
>finally said.

Rowan:.....of course the authors are deity level powers.....reality not
withstanding.

   >     "Thanks. I have to thank Piccolo for that one."

<All>: (Shout) Dragonball SUCKS!!!!

     >   "Nihao," shouted a familiar voice over the roar
     >   of the crowd.

        Rowan: (Moose) “Shampoo!”

      >   Turning around, Samantha spotted Shampoo and
 >Rei just coming into the Club, the Amazon holding a small
 >leaflet of paper in her hands.

  >      "How are you doing?" Rei asked.

    >    "Just killing some time before the next part of the AA
>tournament starts," Washu replied.

Guardian: First you take the tachyon knife like so...then stab
          really hard into the space-time continuum.

Shadow: Or just shoot the clock.

  >      "Good, because I have the perfect thing to do
  >away the time with," the Senshi said.

Bard: Homicidal Rei, coming soon to a clock near you.

  >      "Shampoo find goofy massive crossover on net
  >just now. Want to riff it?" Shampoo asked.

Rowan: gee, I found a goofy riff on the net, want to MST it?

<Bard, Shadow, Guardian>: Sure!

>     Samantha perked up. She had a good chunk of
>aggression to work out and riffing a fanfic was the perfect
>to get it done. "Okay. Lets go."

<All>: We’re happy to return the favor!

>      *               *               *

Shadow: (Rei) “Oh starry knight...”

><The theater doors opened and Samantha, Washu, Rei,
> and Shampoo enter. Samantha sits down in the fourth
> seat while Shampoo takes the fourth. Washu sits in
> the second even as Rei takes the first.>

Bard: Whoohoo! Lesbian Scene!!!

Shadow: In fourth place is Samantha, wait...so’s
        Shampoo! What a display of physical contortions
        as they struggle to fit into the same seat!

>SHAMPOO: Only thing Shampoo not like about AA tournament.

Rowan: (Shampoo) Shampoo unable to hold her liquor!

Bard: I’d like to lick h.....*SMASH*

Guardian: <Looks smug> Now we’re even.

>REI: What's that?
>SHAMPOO: Pat Lee won over Wolf.
>SAMANTHA: Wolf? Oh, that Wolverine rip off.

Rowan: Actually the wolf is not even a tenth as
       mean as a wolverine.

>WASHU: Don't worry Shampoo, he'll get his butt
        kicked by Adam Chris Leigh....
>SAMANTHA: Grrr...
>WASHU: That is, if Samantha hasn't killed hum by then.

<All>: We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. BLEEEEEEEHHH!!!

Bard: How do you kill a hum anyway?

>>Disclaimer:  All characters portrayed in this story
>>are the property of their respective creators and companies.
>>I don't own any of them. Please don't sue me.

>SAMANTHA: <lawyer> Oh, we won't. MWAHAHAHAHA!!!

Bard: When will the hurting stop?

>>This story takes place after volume 38 of the Ranma manga.
>> It draws ideas from anime of all the series involved.

>REI: Uh-oh. I never did read the Manga.

>SAMANTHA: Neither have I.

<All>: Why are we not surprised?

>SHAMPOO: Shampoo make most riffs then.

>>This is special number 2 of my crossover series and
>>takes place after the first one.

>WASHU: Well at least he knows basic arithmetic.

<A highpitched humming starts building in the background>

>>C & C welcomed.  Flames not.

>REI: Too late!

Guardian: Ah, the pyro strikes again.

>>A Ranma/Sailor Moon/Ah! My Goddess/Tenchi Muyo!/Yu Yu Hakusho/Nuku
>>Nuku/Darkstalkers crossover

<All>: Yahoo!!! Alright Donny!!!

>ALL: <stare in shock>
>SAMANTHA: where did he get the money to pay all of you?

Shadow: You’re the avatar, you tell us!

>SHAMPOO: No idea but it okay fanfic we stared in.

Guardian: Okay?! It’s a great story!!!

Rowan: Calm down, they’re entitled to their opinion.

Shadow: Of course we’re entitled to ours.

>WASHU: Actually, I have this strange feeling that it
>sort of comes close to ripping apart the Time/Space continuum.

<Humming increases in intensity>

Rowan: Uh oh....

Bard: What?

>SAMANTHA: Like Minako in...
>REI: It wasn't her fault Nightman wrote such a bad script!
>WASHU: Joxer and Serenity... <shudders>

<All>: <Shudder> We didn’t need to know that!

>>Chocolates, Chocolates, and More Chocolates

>REI: Authors, authors, and more authors...

Bard: Author! Author!

>>By

>SHAMPOO: Man in Iron mask.

>>Donny Cheng
>>
>> Ranma awoke as he felt someone prodding his body.
>>"What is it..? Erk!"  Botan, the spirit guide for
>>the dead, stood over him.

>SAMANTHA: <whispering> Who's that?
>WASHU: I have no idea.

Guardian: She’s from Yu Yu Hakusho, haven’t you read the
          other 6 or so stories before this?

<Humming is now earpiercing>

Rowan: Oh crap......TAKE COVER!!!

*ZOT*

<All four duck under their seats as a Deathstar size
 laser proceeds to blow a hole in the fic>

<Etched in REALLY big letters on the fic>
 “How she dare say that!!! -Little W”

<All of the guys cautiously get back up and take their seats>

Bard: <Whispers to Rowan> She still annoyed about the
      LightHawk Wings?

<Rowan nods>

>> "Ranma, your time has come!  I've come for your body."

> REI: IfyouknowwhatImean!

Shadow: That’s more along Washu’s line of thinking.

>>Botan's voice was disturbingly quiet.

>WASHU: Meaning that Ramna couldn't hear her at all.

<Humming begins again>

>>"I'm dead!?  How?"  Ranma didn't feel any different.
>>Akane didn't try to feed him last night, so it couldn't be that.

>SAMANTHA: Hey, I'll have you know that Akane makes
>some of *the* best spagetthi this side of the Club Anipike!

<All>: O_O

Shadow: .....are you related to Ryoko or Kurumi by any chance?

>> "Who said anything about you being dead?  I said that I've
>>come for your body," Botan giggled.

>REI: <pointing at screen> See? See?
>SHAMPOO: You bad influenza, Samantha.

Rowan:  I knew it! She really is a disease!

>SAMANTHA: I can't help it.

>>Her merriment did nothing to hide the longing in her eyes.
>>Maybe it wasn't all that much of a joke after all.
>>Ranma, of course, didn't notice any of this.

>WASHU: He was too busy trying not to stare at her...

Bard: Now that’s the Washu we know!

>SHAMPOO: Don't you start.

>> "Jeez, I hate it when you do that," Ranma groaned.
>> Botan had one of the weirdest humors he knew of.
>> "What did you want, Botan?"

>SAMANTHA: She just told you: your body!

Guardian: This is Ranma we’re talking about here.

>> "Oh, just this."  Botan suddenly became nervous as
>>she handed to him the box she had carefully wrapped this morning.

>REI: She had better be nervous! C-4 is very touchy stuff.

Shadow: Nah...that would be too merciful.

>> Curious, Ranma took the box.  He started to shake
>>it as if he could tell what it was by the sound.

>SAMANTHA: <makes bomb exploding noise>
>WASHU: <Policeman's voice> Eight years on the Bomb Squad, right?
>SHAMPOO: Now how many people get that one?

<Everyone raises their hand>

>> "No," Botan nearly screamed, "don't shake it.  Just open
>>it when you have the time. Um, I have to go now.
>>Koenma only allowed me five minutes for a break."

>REI: <Botan> She is such a slave driver.

Guardian: Koenma is a he.

>>Botan then hopped back on board her paddle-like transport.
>>She wrestled with herself internally as she looked at
>>Ranma's confused face.  Fighting down a blush, she added,
>>"And, it comes from the bottom of my heart."

>WASHU: <Ramna voice> that would certainly explain all this
> blood over it.
>EVERYONE ELSE: Eww!

<All>: Yuck!

<Crackling starts to grow louder>

>> Ranma waved goodbye to Botan as she left.
>>He then turned his attention on the box.
>>Carefully, like Botan had said, he opened it.
>>His eyes took in the contents and his heart stopped.

>SHAMPOO: Ramna need to cut down on fatty intake.

Rowan: No, that would be Genma.

>>He quickly looked up at the wall where a calendar hung.
>>Valentine's Day.  A day when girls gave chocolates to the
>>boys that they liked.  A feeling of dread came over
>>him.  Funny, he never figured that he would die so young.

>REI: Hey, when I died, I was younger the you!

Shadow: But unlike you, he doesn’t get resurrected when he dies.

Bard: And his death will be much more gruesome then anything
      you've ever faced.

>   * * * * *

>WASHU: <singing> Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

>>Nodoka busily went around the kitchen cleaning
>>up the mess in the kitchen caused the previous
>>night's activities.

>SAMANTHA: Uh, too easy. Not going to touch it.

Guardian: Samantha no Hentai!

Rowan: (To Bard) I’m surprised you aren’t getting etchi here.

Bard: Even I have standards.

>>Despite all the work that stood before her, she had smile
>>on her face.

>SHAMPOO: Great 'A' strike of 98 left many fanfics without first
>letter of alphabet...

>>Today was going to be a very great day if last night was
>>any indication.  She hadn't been surprised when a timid
>>Akane had come to her asking for help making a batch of
>>chocolates.  What did surprise her was Ukyo, one of
>>Ranma suitors, also came asking for help in making sweets.
>>Shampoo came not much later.  It seemed growing up as a
>>boy or as an amazon didn't give a person much experience
>>on Valentine's Day. Nodoka had been more than glad to help
>>the girls in their pursuit of her son.  Her son's manliness
>>overwhelmed her sometimes.

>ALL: AH!!!
>SAMANTHA: Oh man that was bad!
>SHAMPOO: Shampoo feel ill.
>REI: Is Greg and Mike writing this under a new name?
>WASHU: I hope it doesn't get any worst then that.

*ZOT*

<Everyone ducks as another high intenstity energy beam plows
 into the fic>

*It’s spelled RANMA and WORSE!! -Little W*

<All>: Pervert girls!

>> [Oh, wife!]  A panda bear came up to her holding the sign.
>>
>> Nodoka looked at the flowers in her husband's furry paws.
>>"Let's get us some how water," she murmured breathlessly.
>>This was a good day to thank him for getting her manly
>>son so many wonderful fiancées.

>REI: It was also a perfect day for Ramna to start cursing
>out his dad for setting him up with so many fiancees.

Shadow: But he’s got more important things to worry about,
        like figuring out how to survive today.

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> "That little... When I get my hands on her, she's going
>>to wish she'd never been born!"  Rei was furious as she
>>roamed about the temple.

>WASHU: Why were you furious?
>REI: Just read it...

Guardian: It would help if you had read the first couple
          of stories before this.

>> "We don't know for sure, Rei.  Usagi already has Mamoru.
>> You don't really think that she would visit another boy
>>just because he's away at America do you?" Ami meekly tried
>>to intercede on Usagi's behalf, but gave up when the rest of
>>the girls stared at her with disbelief.  Their princess would
>>do it and in a moment.

>SAMANTHA: Okay, the massive crossover I could deal with,
>but Usagi cheating on Mamoru? No way!

Guardian: Who said anything about cheating?

Bard: Besides she still finds guys other then Maomoru attractive,
      even when Mamoru’s around.

>REI: I really hated this part.

Rowan: That’s because you want him all to yourself.

>SHAMPOO: Same here. Ramna marry Shampoo one day!
>WASHU: It's a fanfic, you should really relax.

>> "Come on, let's get there before she hogs him to herself."
>> Minako cradled a small package in her hands.

>ALL: Chocolates.

<All>: What was your first clue?

>>Honestly, they all worked hard at Makoto's to make these
>>and Usagi was going to be there first.  Some people have
>>all the nerve.  She grabbed Artemis, slung him over her shoulder,

>WASHU: <Artemis voice> Ahh!!! Oscar flashback! AHH!!!

*ZOT*

<Everyone ducks as a third blast sears the screen>

Shadow: Don’t even mention that sicko.

>>and raced out the door.

>SHAMPOO: Should be through door since she never opened it.

Rowan: (Raises an eyebow) You don’t know Minako very well do you?

>> Makoto bigsweated.  "She left without us."
>>
>> "Well, what are we waiting for?  Let's go too!"  Rei and
>> the rest quickly followed after Minako.

>SAMANTHA: It's the first Annual Senshi marathon!

Bard: (Annoucer) First prize is...A date with Ranma Saotome!

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> "So the other girls ran out on you, hey?" Haruka asked
>> Chibi-Usa as the little tot and Hotaru got their packages
>>ready.  A grin crept up on to her face.  She didn't envy her
>>former rival at this moment.  She almost felt pity for Ranma.
>> Almost.

>WASHU: Huh?

*ZOT*

<Fourth Blast>

Bard: I think Washu-chan is a wee bit steamed at this.

<The others sweatdrop>

>SAMANTHA: Former rival? Did they go up against each other
>in a Martial Arts tournament or something?
>SHAMPOO: Even Shampoo confused.
>REI: And I'm not too far behind you.

Guardian: Read....the......first.....stories!!!

>> Chibi-Usa nodded, "That Usagi!  What kind of mother does
>>that to her daughter?"
>>
>> "Haruka, wait a moment!" Michiru called out to them before
>>they could leave.  She ran up and placed a small
>>gift-wrapped box in Haruka's hands.  "Better not be late
>>tonight," she winked at the now very red Haruka before leaving.
>>
>> "What was that all about?" Hotaru asked as they got into the car.

>SAMANTHA: <holding head> Who is that?!
>WASHU: I feel a massive headache coming on.

Shadow: AARRRRGGGHHH!!! What’s WRONG WITH YOU?!?!?!!!!
             She’s SAILOR SATURN !!!

>> If possible, Haruka blushed even more.  "I... I'll tell
>> you about it when you're older."
>>
>>   * * * * *

>REI: <singing> When you wish upon a star...

Rowan: I’d like to wish for the suffering to stop.

<Others>: Ditto

>> Keiichi didn't think anyone could be happier than he

>>Nothing can be more perfect.  Hmm...Where were Urd and Skuld?

>SHAMPOO: Skuld no worry about. Urd, on the other hand...

Bard: Ah....you don’t know Skuld very well do you?

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> Skuld blushed as she her thoughts began to wander again.

>WASHU: Oh look, there they go...

Shadow: (Skuld) Get back here you worthless thought!

>>How was she to know that Ranma was taking a bath that
>>time she visited?  Ever since popping up out of the
>>Tendo Dojo's furo and into Ranma's arms, she decided to
>>walk there anytime she wanted to see Ranma.  Strangely, she
>>felt saddened by her choice.  She blushed again as she
>>the thought of Ranma's body flitted past her mind again.
>>  Sheknew one thing, she couldn't wait to see him again.

>REI: But she's only twelve years old!

Guardian: Actually she’s older....lots older.

>SAMANTHA: <mumbling> Please don't go there, please don't go there...

Rowan: Hentai, Never heard of a school girl crush?

>>   * * * * *

>> Urd smiled as she held a chocolate piece in front of her for >>inspection.

Guardian: No, that’s Akane.

Shadow: I thought that was C-ko?

Bard: Urd’s cooking just decides it wants to eat you.

>>Perfect!  Ranma was just going to love this.  Wow, working in
>>the kitchen all this time made her thirsty.

>WASHU: Is this a story or the author's thoughts?
>REI: Both.
>WASHU: Oh, okay... wha?

*ZOT*

<And that makes Five>

>>She glanced at the bottle of extra super strong special
>>sake beside her.  It was empty.  Maybe she used a tad
>>too much for the centers in the chocolate pieces.

>SHAMPOO: Shampoo show you proper way of doing it later.

<Everyone develops a royal sweatdrop>

>>Oh well, it just meant she would have to wait until
>> she and Ranma shared them with each other.  Hahaha!

>ALL: BWAHAHAHA!!!

<All>: Women...know them....Love them....Fear their laughter.

>> Morrigan smiled as she held a chocolate piece in front of

Bard: Now that I would pay good money to see!

>>various potions in front of her.  If this didn't make
>>Ranma lose he inhibitions, nothing would.  That boy was
>>just too naïve at times. What did he think she wanted
>>when she visited him last week in the middle of the night
>>wearing even less than she usually did?

>SHAMPOO: Ramna not naive, he just shy.

<All>: He’s naive.

>>Of course, Lilith, the other part of her soul, thought
>>that it was cute and made her leave before she could

>SAMANTHA: Yeah, those other souls can give you quite a

Rowan: Hear hear.

<Shadow & the Guardian give him the evil eye>

>>This time, she wouldn't listen to that little minx
>>and Ranma will be hers.  Hehehe!

>REI: Uh oh. Looks like the Joker hit her with his laughing gas.

Shadow: We could use some for this riff.

>>Ranma-sama was just going to love this.  She glanced at

>SAMANTHA: Oh man! Isn't there *any* originality left in

<All>: The pot is calling the kettle black here!

Rowan: This is actually a very good series, you just
       haven’t read the other parts yet!

>> "Of course, what do you take me for?"  Ryoko replied to herself.

>REI: Thus giving a new meaning to the term: Split personality.

>> "Just what do you think you're doing?"  Ayeka asked as
>> walked outside of the temple to where the Ryokos stood.
>>
>> "None of your business!"  Both Ryokos said simultaneously.

>WASHU: At least the writer had written my daughter correctly.

Bard: With all the goofups I thought this was the T.V. version of Washu-chan.

>> "You aren't thinking of splitting up and going to
>> Nerima are you?  I always knew that you weren't right for
>>Tenchi with your lecherous ways."  Ayeka looked at the two
>>Ryokos with disdain.

>SHAMPOO: As opposed to open disgust.

Rowan: There’s a world of difference between the two.

>>The Ryokos became one again and energy started forming
>>in her hands. "Oh?  And to why does it seem that you have
>>two packages in your hand? I don't suppose one of them is
>>for someone other than Tenchi."

>SAMANTHA: Is everyone giving a box of chocolates to Ramna?
>What about the other guys in the series? I'm sure Ryouga
>would get one from Ukyo or someone else...

Shadow: Ryouga’s a twotiming honorless pervert, besides
        he’s probably lost anyway.

Guardian: Besides this is a RANMA fic.

>> Ayeka carefully put down the two boxes of chocolates in
>>her hand down on a safer place.  Humans certainly had
>>strange customs on special holidays.  One she set them
>>down,

>WASHU: And remember proper spelling...

<All>: You’re one to talk!

>>she turned a faced Ryoko.  Electricity cackled all
>>around her and their ongoing fight began anew.

>REI: The Hydro bill is going to be enormous!

>> Sasami and Washu watched this from the sidelines with
>>bored expressions.
>>Fortunately they had both handed their gifts for Ranma
>>to Ryo-ohki to take to him in advance.
>>  They were both free to spend the day with Tenchi when
>>he got back from his chores.

>SHAMPOO: Smart move, Washu.
>WASHU: Thank you.

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> Kyusaku shook his head with disbelief as he finished
>>off another batch of chocolates. Nine hundred more to go.
>> When he had told Nuku Nuku that girls made chocolates and
>>gave them to boys on Valentine's day, he never expected her
>>to make them for every boy in school.

>SAMANTHA: What school? Last time I checked, she wasn't in one.

Guardian: Check again.

>REI: You are really mad, aren't you? You've been nitpicking
> all fanfic.
>SAMANTHA: Sorry. Adam just...
>WASHU: Give it a rest and relax.

>>It took him awhile to explain that the 'like' she
>>felt for Ranma was one that really mattered on
>>this special day.  After hearing that, his daughter
>>bounded out the door as fast she could.

>SAMANTHA: I'm guessing that the first part of this
>series was all the girls *meeting* Ramna.

<All>: Halleluyah! She finally figured that out!

>> <Ring> <Ring>
>>
>> Kyusaku stopped in midst of eating yet another chocolate pieces

>REI: Whoa! That's a big piece!

Bard: (Snicker) Yes, it certainly is.

>>and picked up the phone.  "Hello?"
>>
>> "I've sent a baby sitter to the house.  Meet me at eight
>>at the old place.  Oh, and do bathe and dress nicely."
>>  Came a cold sounding voice from the other end.

>WASHU: <cold voice> Leave one hundred thousand dollars in
> unmarked bills on the corner of Fifth and Main by ten
> thirty tonight.

>> <Click>
>>
>> Kyusaku glared at the phone.

>SHAMPOO: <Kyusaku> Stupid phone, god I hate you!

>>For some reason, he couldn't hold it on his face.
>>  It kept dropping into a foolish looking grin.

>REI: The phone or his face?

Rowan: Knowing Kyusaku probably both.

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> Ranma stared at water

>WASHU: That should be stared at *the* water.
>SAMANTHA: You're not starting that again, are you?
>WASHU: NO, I just couldn't come up with a better riff.

*Zot*

<Shot Six>

<Duck and Cover>

>>as he stood near the bridge's railing.  He had made
>>sure to choose a different bridge this time so he could
>>not be found.  Why couldn't he keep his big mouth shut!?  He
>>questioned himself for what felt like the hundredth time.

>SHAMPOO: After all, he kept count.

>> The day had been a disaster the moment the first of the
>>girls started to appear.  The moment he was offered one box of >>chocolates
another offer came right behind.  It didn't take
long for them to compete who would get him to eat whose
>>chocolates first.

>SAMANTHA: <annoucer's voice> YES IT'S THE ROYAL RUMBLE OF THE ANIME
        GIRLS WHERE THE WINNER TAKES RAMNA!!!
>EVERYONE ELSE: <hands over ears> Ow.

<All>: TOO LOUD!!! WHAT? I CAN’T HEAR YOU! I SAID IT’S
       TOO LOUD!!! NO NEED TO SHOUT!!!

>> The later events became a blur in his memory.  Somehow
>>or other, Urd, Morrigan, and Kodachi each managed to
>>stuff a piece of chocolate in his face.  It had the weird
>>of affect of making him speak his mind. Literally!
>> He briefly remembered his exact words to them as being
>>'LEAVE ME ALONE, ALL OF YOU'.  He cringed as he thought
>>at how loud he must have sounded.  The only thing he wanted
>>to do now was curl up and die.
>>
>> "I don't think that such a good idea," A feminine voice called out.

>REI: God?

<All>: *Buzzer* Wrong, try again!

>WASHU: Besides, you'll be spared being brought into allot of crappy
        fanfics... hmmm...

Bard: At least it’s better then being in a crappy MST.

>> "Huh?"  Ranma broke out of his depression thoughts and looked
>>at the woman in front of him.  She was tall with long
>>flowing hair.  Her face, while beautiful, held an ageless
>>quality making it hard to determine her exact age.

>SAMANTHA: Shion? What the heck is she doing here?

<All>: Huh?

>>She seemed be anywhere from her late teens to her late twenties.
>> Had she read his mind?
>>
>> "Standing so close to the railing I mean," she explained to Ranma.
>>
>> "Oh.  Don't worry, I wasn't about the jump or anything stupid.
>> I guess I just didn't notice how close I was to the edge,"
>>Ranma assured her.

>REI: Okay, the lady with the pail of water should be around here
>        somewhere.

<All>: Huh?

>>"A lot on your mind?  Sometimes it helps to let out
>>.your feelings rather than let them fester inside of you.
>> I'm not going anywhere soon."

>SHAMPOO: Next on Jerry Springer show...

Shadow: ....Frustrated MSTers of MSTers take their revenge!

Bard: One can always hope.

>> Ranma felt himself drawn in by the kind and comforting tone.
>> He soon related the entire day's events to her.  "...then I
>>rushed out of there and here I am," Ranma finished and reached
>>for another piece of chocolate the lady had kindly offered to
>>share with him.  She didn't seem to eat any herself though.

>SAMANTHA: Probably because of the large amount of poison she
> had laced them with.
>REI: Feeling dark?
>SAMANTHA: <sarcastic> Naw!

<All>: Let there be light!

>> "And here you are.  I'm sure the girls would forgive
>>you for your outburst.  It was understandable under
>>the circumstances."

>WASHU: After all, most men would just hate it when several
 young and beautiful women beings them chocolates at one time.

*ZOT*
<7>

Shadow: This is Ranma we’re talking about here, his women troubles are
legendary.

>> "Oh, I know they will.  They're all really nice, despite
>>how some of them act sometimes.  In truth, it might have
>>been the best thing I've ever done, walking out like that.
>>If I had stayed, they would have continued fighting over me,
>>getting angry at each other..."

>SHAMPOO: And then Shampoo would have to fight off even *more*
> suitors!

<All>: Gee...ain’t that a shame....

>> "...and you figured that this way they will all be angry
>>at you instead.  Ranma, Ranma, Ranma," she sighed as gently
>>admonished him.

>SAMANTHA: Who's Gently?
>WASHU: Brother of Kindly.
>SHAMPOO: Cousin to Happily.
>REI: And father to Cheerfully.

Guardian: You forgot sister Faithfully, and baby Joyfully.

<Ryo-ohki plays another rimshot>

>>"Do you really think this would make them happier?  The only
>>reason, the girls came to you in the first place was to be
>>with you.  Why? Because today is a special day to many girls,
>>and who better to spend it with then the boy they like.  Sure,
>>they may fight, but I think they would be more then willing to
>>put aside their differences if it meant they could enjoy this
>>holiday with you.  Why don't you give them another chance?
>>I'm sure it will turn out better."

>WASHU: Just like a brick is soft.

Rowan: Well if it’s an ice-cream brick...

>> Ranma believed her.  He didn't know why, but he felt as
>>if could trust this stranger. Stranger?  He rubbed his head
>>sheepishly.  "Thank you, um, Miss..."

>REI: Ayumi?

Bard: Wrong time.

>SHAMPOO: Cologne?

Guardian: Wrong age.

>SAMANTHA: Ayunami?

Shadow: Wrong series.

>WASHU: Masaki?

Rowan: Wrong plane of existence.

>> "Setsuna.  Call me Setsuna, Ranma."

>SAMANTHA: I have no idea who that is.

<All>: SHE’S SAILOR PLUTO!!!

>> "Miss Set... um, I mean Setsuna.  Thank you for your advice.
>> Oops, I accidentally ate all of your chocolates.  Sorry, about
>>that."  She must have been saving them for her boyfriend.
>> Now he blew it.

>SHAMPOO: BIG TIME!

Shadow: Jealous?

>> Surprisingly, Setsuna seemed to be pleased rather than
>>angry with him.  "That's okay, Ranma.  They were going
>>to go to waste whether you ate them or not."  Setsuna then
>>turned and left.
>>
>> Ranma didn't believe her.  A wonderful woman like that had
>>to have a boyfriend.  She was just being kind to him by not
>>telling him otherwise.
>>
>>   * * * * *

>SAMANTHA: All right, anyone have a new star joke?

Bard: “I count the number of stars in the sky....”

>> "You must have it bad, Urd.  I can't imagine you in a
>>kitchen making chocolate."
>>Morrigan laughed at that thought.

>SHAMPOO: But didn't she say it?
>WASHU: Details, details...

Rowan: Nitpicking, Nitpicking.

>> Urd glared but then schooled her features.  "I suppose
>>those chocolates of yours are store bought?" she asked cooly.

>REI: <Morrigan voice> Why of course they... D'OH!

>> "No, I made them from..." Morrigan grimaced.  Urd caught
>>her with her own words. She must have had it bad, if she
>>was so besotted with the boy that she couldn't even think
>>straight.

>> Ryo-ohki suffered under the ministrations of the various
>> girls as they each took turns petting her.

>SAMANTHA: <Ryo-oh-ki> Ack! Not so hard!

<Everyone turns a little green at that>

Shadow: Hello pervert girl.

>>Perhaps, suffered is the right word for how she felt.
>> Skuld seem to take more than her fair share of the time
>>though.  Nobody commented on the hammer she held in her arm
>>as she looked at Ryo-ohki was a gleam in her eyes.

>SHAMPOO: Oh no! Skuld gone nuts!
>REI: <Skuld voice> You will be mine. Oh yes, you will be mine.

<All>: Bleck!

>> Usagi stared at the others like at deer at an oncoming car.
>> "It's not what you think!
>>He's my cousin!  Can't I do something nice for a family member?"

>SAMANTHA: Ramna is Usagi's cousin? <groans and holds head>

Rowan: No, she’s Ranma’s cousin.

>WASHU: Oh yeah. I had completely forgotten about this part.

*MEGA-ZOT*
<8>

>> "No!" came the resounding reply from Rei and Minako.
>> Ami's 'no' was much softer.
>>
>> Nuku Nuku stood by Shampoo talking about the art of
>>being a waitress. The two girls had become great friends
>>in the short time that they knew each other.

>SHAMPOO: Cat-girl show me cool flip to do on bike!

>> Makoto asked Ukyo for tips on making okonomiyaki.  They
>>too hit it off after they each learned their dreams of
>>becoming a chef was similar.

>REI: Look at it this way, Samantha. At least they're all not
>    gather to fight their enemies or something.

Bard: Or something...Ahehehehe....

>> Kodachi seemed to be in a daze.  Her Ranma-sama thanked
>>her as he ate the only piece of chocolate of her gift not
>>lace with paralysis potion.  She decided to take that as
>>a compliment.

>WASHU: A good thing she didn't see him tossing his cookies in the
        corner.

Rowan: She’s not Akane.

>> Akane smiled as she watched Ranma eat a piece of her
>>chocolate and didn't complain.
>>He actually complimented her.  The only thing that
>>puzzled her was why he asked her if there was any salt left.

>ALL: Huh?

Shadow: Akane used tequila in the mix again.

>> Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, being viewed as little girls,
>>didn't receive much attention as they hogged most of Ranma's time.

>SAMANTHA: Who *is* that?

<All>: WE JUST TOLD YOU!

>> It was an odd gathering.

Bard: Ranma, the Gathering. The newest edition of the Magic game.

>WASHU: And a massive crossover.

<All>: Amen.

>>Ranma surrounded by girls smiling and handing him their gifts.
>> For once, he believed that their smiles weren't entirely
>>forced.  Setsuna was right.  The only thing on the girls' minds
>>when he reappeared was if he was okay.  After that, it didn't
>>take much convincing to tell them to behave or he would leave
>>again.  All in all, he just felt glad to be alive.

>SHAMPOO: Considering he ate Urd's cooking, we're amazed he is.

Bard: Jealous?

>>   * * * * *
>>
>> Ayeka and Ryoko picked themselves off the ground and groaned.

>SAMANTHA: ARGH! Lemon!

Bard: I wish...

Guardian: She reminds me of Akane.

>>Their fight had lasted the whole day.  Looking up, they
>>groaned again that the scene before them.

>REI: Was horribly written.

<All>: Look who’s talking!

>> "Thank you, Mihoshi, for your chocolates."  Tenchi came
>> out with Sasami and Washu as they saw Mihoshi off.1

>WASHU: One? I don't get it.
>SHAMPOO: So they saw detective off number... Story makes less
> sense in this part.
>REI: No doubt there.

>> "That's okay!  I like this earth custom.  It was fun."
>> Mihoshi waved good bye and left.

>SAMANTHA: Just like that, just left...

>> Ayeka and Ryoko plopped back down on the ground.
>>
>>   * * * * *
>>
>>The End. (maybe)

>SAMANTHA: ARGH!!! <gets up and runs out of the theater>
>WASHU: She really needs to learn how to relax.
>REI: This whole Adam thing is beginning to get to her.
>SHAMPOO: She need good stiff drink.

<All>: We could use one too!

>ALL: <get up and leave the theater>

Shadow: (Darth Vader) “We’ll just have take them out ship by ship.”

 Rowan: Well that’s the end of our 2nd MST.

Bard: That author should have done her reading before MSTing
      Donny’s great story.

Guardian: Although there are spelling and grammar errors...

<The door behind the four slides open to reveal Washu’s lab>

Nurse Washu: Time for your Physical!

Shadow: Gee..look at the time....

Guardian: Err....I’ve got someplace to be...

Rowan: (Looks nervous as hell) Ah.heh......what about the riffers?

Nurse-Washu: Oh them, well you see...
