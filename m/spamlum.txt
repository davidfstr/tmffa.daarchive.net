"I'm sorry, Tenchi, but I just can't go on like this."

Tenchi pouted.  "But, Ayeka..."

"I admit, I did love you.  You were my knight in shining armor.  But, my
heart can not bear to see my love with...that demon...any longer.  I
would be honored if you would be my friend, but please, Tenchi, if you
will not stay away from her, I can not bear being in love with you."

"Very well."  The part-Juraian hid a smile.  He had been secretly hoping
that something like this would happen.  "But, could you at least be
friends with Ryoko?"

Ayeka's mood chilled so quickly that Tenchi involuntarily took a step
back.  "Never," she hissed.  "She will be your wife, and for that reason
only, I will tolerate her presence.  Please do not ask me for anything
further."

"All right," he sighed.  Tenchi had no intention of giving up on getting
the two women he was closest to to make up, but it would take a while.

"Thank you.  To tell you the truth, I did not make this decision easily,
or alone.  There is another on this planet who...shares my interests.
We have become close recently.  That one, too, sought a mate whose heart
was already claimed by another."

"Really?  Who is it?"

At first, Tenchi wondered when Ryoko had restyled her hair and dyed it
green.  Then he realized that, as risque as Ryoko's outfits were, even
she rarely wore only a tiger striped bikini.  The alien who had just
flown into his view was definitely not Ryoko.

"There you are, Darling."

"Tenchi, I would like you to meet Lum."
