        The gang on the Sattelite of Love were in their usual places. Mike getting some Nachos and Salsa.... Gypsy slaving over the ship, and Crow and Tom doing there own stuff.
        "Oh MIIIIIKKKEE!!" Yelled the red bot, Tomas Servo.
        "Come in heeeerrree!!" Yelled the golden one with a net, Crow T. Robot. Mike came as usual to see what gag they had in store.
        "Yeah... What is it now?" asked Micheal J. Nelson.
        "Servo and I have constructed a documentry video" said Crow.
        "On the Civil War?" asked Mike.
        "No... on what happens 30-minutes after a show shoot is over" told Tom.
        "Oh...uhhh.. Let me See it." said Mike. Crow grabbed their TV and a VCR and put in a tape labled 'Joke' onto it. As Tom hit play, the image of black comes on.
        "Neato....huh Mike?" asked Crow.
        "Yeah....when will it get to it?" said Mike.
        "Uhh.... This is it Mike" said Tom
        "Oh"
        The Red Light came on while the video was in it's 5th minute of total darkness. Mike turned off the tape and anwsered to Dr.F's call.
        "Greetings, My prisoners" said Clayton, holding a machine near him. TV Frank ran up to him.
        "Greetings, Sir" said Frank
        "I WASN'T Talking to YOU FRANK!" said the diabolical doc. "Anyway, It's time for our invention exchange. You go first.
        "Well, we were almost out of ideas untile Crow here gaves us one" started Mike. He held up a small disk. As he was walking to the computer, he started talking again. "This Disk contains a proggie for AOL called 'SOL Vrs. AOL. This can do a whole lot more than just Magenta. You can type in Deep 13 here and it will send you plently of Junk Mail." He started typing in the 'JMail' box Deep 13 and then hit order. 
        "Why that is odd crap, my prisoner." stated the doc. "You Se...." The Doc was interupted by a doorbell ringing. "TV, go and get it."
        "Yes Sir" said TV Frank, walking as usual to the door. He came back about 15 seconds later with a package. "That was the MayTag guy, Sir... he gave us this dishwasher"
        "Why... how nice of him" said the evil doc. "Swirly Him Later, Frank!"
        "Yes Sir"
        "Now Here is MY invention. You saw this in my hand earlier. This is a Dimension Teleporter. And I am gonna add someone to the squad. And to be nice, I'm gonna let you guys pick."
        "Wow! Kewl!" said Crow. "Let's bring Usagi up here!"
        "No Way!" said Mike. "How about Oscar?"
        The Three shivered
        "DON'T SCARE US!" yelled the two bots.
        "What about Ryoko?" asked Tom. The three thought about it.
        "Or Iria?" asked Crow.
        "Allright." said Mike, getting a quater out. "Heads- Iria, Tails - Ryoko, ok?"
        "Right" said the two bots. The coin was flipped into the air. After 2 seconds, it landed back onto the ground as heads.
        "Iria from the Anime Dimension Dr.F" said Crow.
        "How does it work anyway?" questioned Tom Servo.
        "Why it's quite simple" Just say the person's name and what dimension and boom." He began to talk on the Dimision Teleport. "Iria from Anime Dimentsion. Soon, Iria, in her battle suit and all, was teleported onto the SOL.
        "Huh? Where am I?" said Iria. 
        "Uhh... Hi, Iria" said Tom.
        "Yeah...Hi" said Crow.
        "Welcome to the Sattelite of Love" welcomed Mike.
        "Is this a gay place or something?" asked Iria.
        "No. I'll explain everything." told Mike
        Mike told Iria about the SOL, Dr.F and the Fanfics. She had a small frown on her face once that was done.
        "This sucks!" Iria shouted.
        "Doesn't it not?" told Crow.
        "Anyway, guess you are a part of us now, huh?" asked Mike.
        "Yeah... guess so."
        Dr.F knocked on the HectoScreen. "Excuse me for bonding, but it's time for your fanfic, Smellson. Your Fanfic today is BEHIND THE SCENES-TENCHI MUYO! Iria, hope you enjoy it! MWHAHA!!
 
The Yellow Siren came on! "WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!!!" yelled Mike going into the theater. Iria followed the bots

Iria: Thanks for the warning!
Crow: NO Prob!

Mike: God!! What is wrong with this picture!!

>RYOKO:  Yeah!  I mean, can any of those bimbos down at Sailor Moon say thay've

 >on break?
>
>MIHOSHI:  You mean he threw another tantrum?  I swear, anytime something dosen't

 >to grope me!  You know in OAV 1, when I had to lie in that bed?  That sunnova bitch
 >copped a feel as soon as the cammeras stopped!  I slapped him so hard that his little
 >hentai nose bled for real. 
>
>MIHOSHI:  Tell me about it!  In the little Taro eps, I had to strip in front of that little
 >pervert.  You know, I'm not sure but I could have sworn that only one hand was visible
 >the whole time...
>
>ALL:  EWWWW!
>
>RYOKO:  Well, I for one am glad I'm waiting till I'm married.  If casual sex makes you
 >into THAT, I'm glad I'm a virgin!
>
>AEKA:  You don't know what you're missing, sister.  (she takes out a cigerette and
 >offers to Sasami, who takes out her own)
>
>SASAMI:  Thanks anyway.  
>
Iria: She also takes LSD and she's a hooker at night.
Crow: EWW!
Iria: Thats the truth!

>WASHU:  I'm no rocket scientist, but...
>
>MIHOSHI:  That's for damn sure.
>
>WASHU:  ..I think that you might be a little too young to smoke, Sasami.  Those could
 >seriously hurt you...
>
>RYOKO:  (Whispering to Washu)  And this is bad because...?
>
>WASHU:  Good point.
>

Iria: (Washu) Hehehe....I'll get the chainsaw
Mike: (Ryoko) I'll get a sword
Crow: MIKE!
Tom: It's out turn to say it! (Now acting Like Mihoshi) I'll get the revolver.
Crow: I'll get the Cheesy Poofs
(The others stare at Crow)
Crow: It sounds funny!

>Enter Kagato dressed in a pink polo shirt and kakhis.  He has a can of TAB in his hand.

Mike: Tim Mclee, Kagato says Make Me Laugh.

>KAGATO:  Morning gals.
>
>ALL:  Morning Kag.
>
>KAGATO:  Anyone seen Tenchi?  We got into a fight last night about wether I should
 >come back to the show or not and well...

Crow: And he won!

>SASAMI:  Lemmie guess, the little bastard got mad 'cause he wouldn't have the
> spotlight on him 24-7?

Iria: (Kagato) No! He was mad because he wouldn't be shown at the 7-11!

>RYOKO:  (Under her breath)  Like you're one to talk.
>
>WASHU:  I would think that since you're the director, you would have some say on
 >this...
>
>KAGATO:  Well, I kinda wrote the part for Sam Neil, but he backed out to go work on
> some other space movie..
>
>RYOKO:  So you filled in?  I always wondered why those sunglasses didn't seem to fit
 >you.

Tom: (Kagato) Those Ray-Bans were cool though!

>
>KAGATO:  Those were the worst three weeks of my life; the costume didn't fit right,
> Tenchi was off on one of his little tiffs, and that sword...!  I swear that thing had to weigh
 >about 20 pounds easy.  
>
>AEKA:  Why didn't you get someone to fill in for you? 
>
>KAGATO:  No time. We were pressed that week as it was, what with her royal
> heighness having to sneak out early for her mall appearances.
>
>SASAMI:  Hey!

Mike: (Sasami) I got a whole bunch of green stuff from that! But mother took it away, saying it was evil and she needed it.

>KAGATO:  I really wish you wouldn't smoke, Sasami.  You'll wind up sounding like
> Fujisawa from El-Hazard two sets over.
>
>WASHU:  Um, excuse me..
>
>Washu quietly runs off sobbing.

>AEKA:  You said the 'F' word!

>KAGATO:  Dou!  Come on, they broke up how long ago?
>
>MIHOSHI:  About three months, give or take.
>
>AEKA:  Those words have new meaning with Washu.

Crow; It Means 'Loser of the week!'

>RYOKO:  Why does she do this?  She knows these guys just want her 'cause she'll
> give it up.  Come on, how dumb do you have to be to belive a guy when they say, "I love
> you" after knowing you for 20 minutes?

Iria: (Kagato) Dumb enough to eat Akane's food.
Others: (Shiver)

>SASAMI:  Say, I thought he was dating Miz?  What happened there?

>AEKA:  Lesbian.

>RYOKO:  Raging.

>MIHOSHI:  Totally DC.

Mike: Washinton D.C?
Tom: MIKE!
Mike: I feel like it today.

>SASAMI:  Ahh, I see...

>RYOKO:  Yeah, I think she's dating Makoto now..

>SASAMI:  But you just said...

>AEKA:  Wrong Makoto.

>SASAMI:  (Pause)  I see.  Those senshi are EVERYWHERE!

Iria: But Makoto makes better food than YOU, Sasmi! All she has to do is NUKE IT!
Crow: Cool!

>ALL:  Damn straight.
 
>Washu comes back, now only slightly sobbing.

>WASHU:  I'm sorry, I just had something in my eye.  So, what's everyone talking about?

ALL: FUJISAWA!!
Crow: (Washu) WAHHH!!

>ALL:  Nothing.

>Yosho, Azaka and Kamadaki enter.

Tom: You are next on Hollywood Squares!

>YOSHO:  Hey.

>AZAKA:  Greetings.

>KAMADAKI:  Yo.

>KAGATO:  Hey guys.

Mike: Ready to die?
Iria: Is this one of his days?
Crow: Lemme check (Checks calander) Uhh... Sunday, June 14..... Yep!

>Azaka and Kamadaki fill up two dixie cups and gulp 'em down.

>AEKA:  You know, I never understood how you two did that without arms.

AZAKA:  It's a talent.

Iria: The 1998 Talent Show! No one will be seated as Azaka fills up a Pepsi Freeze!

>YOSHO:  So, where is the little..

>RYOKO:  Watch you're language, Yosho.

>YOSHO:  Sorry.  

Crow: (Yosho) I'm just pissed off at him!

>AEKA:  The 'crown prince of Jurai' is sulking in his trailer.

Iria: He could be playing Super Famicom!
Crow: How do you know.
Iria: he tried to pick me up with several lines and one of them was a Super Famicom one.
Crow: Get a PLAYSATION TENCHI!

>KAMADAKI:  Is this about that whole 'let's bring back Kagato' thing?

>KAGATO:  Yeah.  The little bugger dosen't realize that thoes two epsiodes sold more
 than every act of Dominion Tank Police combined.

>MIHOSHI:  Gee, we sold five copies?

Tom: (Kagato) Actually two, but who's counting?

>AEKA:  I don't know, five seems pretty high for DTP.

>SASAMI:  Hmph!  The Pretty Sammy DVD's sold more than this entire series! 
 Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here!

>Enter lady Masaki.

Iria: This is a big game show...huh?
Mike: Tenchi Masaki... THIS IS YOUR LIFE!!
Crow: You remember this voice?
Tom: (Cabbit) Miya!
Crow: It's your mother's neighbor's sister's uncle's nephew's cabbit!

>SASAMI:  And lo, my answer approacheth.

Crow: Sasami knows old english?

>MASAKI:  There you are Sasami!  Oh, you're dress is all wrinkled and your hair..! 
 >Kagato, I thought you said my little star here would be looked after!

Mike: (Kagato) Well, she's being a total bitch ma'am!
Crow: You are DARK today....
Tom: I thought we already got past that side...

>KAGATO:  Sorry, ma'am.

Iria:(Kagato) It's just that Tenchi's being a asshole, and Nippon Express won't make us a commerical....

>MASAKI:  Oh well, I guess my little princess will just have to suffer for now.  Don't you
> worry honey, as soon as mommy finishes buying up Disney, we'll put you in a real
 >series.

Iria: (Masaki) We will make you torture Winnie The Pooh!

>  Oh pooh, 

Crow: Is she trying to interact with us?

>I'm suspossed to do lunch with Funaho in 5.  Well, keep it up,
 >everyone!

>Masaki leaves.

Tom: Someone finnaly decided not to be on the show...
Mike: She never WAS on the show.
Tom: Oh...

>SASAMI:  AARRG!  I hate this!  Why does she always put me in these crappy little
 >kawaii roles?

>AEKA:  Because you're her little girl and she owns 80% of the company, along with
> everything else on God's green earth.

>RYOKO:  Listen, as much as I love hanging around, we really should get back to work.  

Crow: (Sasami) But isn't talking work?

>MIHOSHI:  Yeah, this is fun, but it's cutting into our work time.

>WASHU:  Aww, do we have to?  I'm really tired... I know, this time I'll crash on the
 >couch for 15 hours and you can work in that stupid styrofoam lab, whadya say,
 >Mihoshi?

Iria: The 4th law of therodynamics won't allow that!!

>MIHOSHI:  No way!  God, sometimes I'm envious of Kyonie.

>YOSHO:  Yeah, I wish I was a producer, that way I'd get to pick when I want to go on
 >too.

>AZAKA:  Amen.

>AEKA:  So what's next?

Tom: (Kagato) Ok. Aeka and Ryoko fight while  Sasami watches South Park and cusses out Rhy-Ohki.
Iria: Sounds like the actual thing!

>KAGATO:  (Checking a script and sipping his TAB)  Well, Yosho, you have a fight
 >scene with an evil robot out to kidnap Aeka.

ALL:(Sarcasticly) Oh....how original!

>YOSHO:  Not another one!  You know how lousy I am with weapons!

>KAGATO:  We all know, but I'm afraid you're gonna have to go it again.

>SASAMI:  Say, wasn't that fight Tenchi's?

>KAGATO:  Yes, but his royal heighness informed me that he "just didn't feel like
 >exuhasting his acting talents today."

Crow: Tenchi's Ass talks?
Mike: CROW!!
Crow: what?

>KAMADAKI:  Acting talents?  I take it you're referring to his Kermit the frog
 impersonation?

Tom: He does a good Kermit Impersonation!

>MIHOSHI:  That waste of space couldn't act his way out of a box!  Why the hell don't we
 >get Makoto from El-Hazard to fill in?  He's MUCH nicer to work with!  Now THAT's one
 >part that was truly type cast.

>AEKA:  Yeah, too bad Ifurita turned out to be a real bitch.

>AZAKA:  Indeed.  Makoto seemed like such a nice young man, it was pa pity Ifurita was
 >just using him to get back at Matoko.

All: HUH?

>WASHU:  Matoko?  Say wha?

>YOSHO:  You know, that little lesbian android from Ghost in the Shell?

>WASHU:  SHE's a lesbian too?

>AEKA:  Yep.

>RYOKO:  'Fraid so.

>MIHOSHI:  I always thought she wasn't playing for the same team, if ya know what I
> mean.

>WASHU:  So she slept with...?

>SASAMI:  Gosh you're quick Washu.  It took me only two whole seconds to figure THAT
 >one out!

Iria: It's usually the other way around.

>WASHU:  Um, excuse me again.  (she runs off sobbing again)

>KAGATO:  Waitaminute.  She dated...

>RYOKO:  NO.  She had a fling with Makoto right after the Fujisawa incident.  Apperantly
>Makoto got a little tanked at the cast party and Washu-chan decided to show up as
> Washu-san.

>KAGATO:  Ahh.  Is she trying to sleep with every single member of the cast or what?

Crow: Yep! Thats her job!
Mike: Don't make me hurt you.

>MIHOSHI:  Apperently she wants to leave our little cast and join up with theirs.

>AZAKA:  That little...

>KAMADAKI:  ...bitch!

Tom: I hope you are referring to Sasami!

>YOSHO:  Woah, woah.  We all know there's no way Masaki will let Washu go.  Masaki
 >thinks she's the (quick glance to Sasami) SECOND most kawaii person in the series.

>SASAMI:  Damn straight.

>KAGATO:  (Glancing at his watch)  All right, cooler break's over!  Let's get back to work
 >everybody!

>Multiple grumbles emerge as the cast tosses their dixie cups into the trash.

Mike: (Sasami) I AM KAWAII, MY SLAVES!!
Crow: What the hell did you just say?
Mike: I dunno...

>AEKA:  So Azaka?

>AZAKA:  Yes, Aeka?

>AEKA:  How DO you drink out of those dixie cups?  I mean, don't tkae this the wrong
> way or anything, but you're a log.  You don't have hands, you don't have a mouth...hell,
 >you don't even have feet!  How the hell are you walking?!

>AZAKA:  You know, I don't reall know.

>Crow: Well I don't reall know about how much reall is a klondike bar!

        "It was not that bad" said Iria, exiting the theater. But her red hair was covered with sweat as she said those words.
        "It's get worse." said the only Golden Bot you and me know.
        "You know, I wonder why he let us pick someone up here" asked Mike.
        "WHAT!" yelled a pissed off Iria. "Oh well... It's better than fighting Zerim.
        "You think" yelled Dr.F. The HectoScreen glowed as usual with Dr.F's ugly mug. "I am just about to bring the immortal monster to Earth!"
        "WHAT" yelled Mike.
        "You can't do that!" yelled a even more pissed off Iria.
        "But I am! Say goodbye to New York City!"
        "I never liked New York" said Tom.
        "Me too" said Crow.
        "What about Shelbyville, Ky?" asked the Doc.
        "Never heard of it!" said Crow.
        "Then... Bombs away!!" yelled the mad doctor as he about hit the button. But before that will ever happen. TV Frank came into the room.
        "South Park is on sir!" said Frank.
        "Dangit!" yelled the Doc. "Oh Well, guess it will have to wait till next time. I'll make sure you get a even worse fic next time!"
        "Allright..." said Iria. "If you can."
        The HectoScreen closed
        "Frank, is that the epidsode where they have Starvin Marvin in it? That was pretty neat!" asked Dr.F....

        Well, my Second MSTing is done! I'm glad I picked a shorter and easier one this time! Anyway, I hope you have enjoyed it and stay tuned for my others. BTW, If you are wondering why I picked Iria is that she's pretty cool and not as known as Ryoko. Sorry Ryoko Fans (I'm a fan of Ryoko too). Thanks for your time!!
