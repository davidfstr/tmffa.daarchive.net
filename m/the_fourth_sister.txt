Author's Notes:

As many of you who read Tenchi Muyo Fan Fictions know, there are a 
lot of theories about Tsunami, Washu, and Tokimi being sisters and
godesses. Well, let's just say my brain fried one day and I thought,
"What if there was a fourth sister? Who might it be and what would she 
be like?" Thus, the following short fan fic. Hope you enjoy it!


Set up:

The time is sometime after the OAV 13. Tokimi, Washu, and Tsunami can be
seen sitting around a round table, floating in space. An elegant tea set
sits upon it.

Tokimi: 
Well!! Finally you two decide to rejoin me. I must say it's been very
boring without the two of you around.

Washu:
All in the name of science! Tokimi. A true scientific genius must
continuously search and expand her mind. It was just filled with so many
surprises, that dimension!

Tokimi:
Washu neechan, you can drop the act now. Really, Tsunami, how could you 
stand her like that?!

Tsunami:
Why'd you think I was a tree?

Tokimi:
I've always wondered about that . . .

Washu:
Fine. I just wanted to let my childish side, Washu chan, have some fun 
afterall.

Tsunami:
Anyways, it is good to be back. The avatars are handling the situation 
quite well. Tenchi's finally able to control his powers at will.

Washu:
And Ryoko's mellowed out a bit as well.

Tokimi:
Um, who was, you know, her avatar?

Tsunami:
I always suspected that it was Ayeka. Although how she could manage to 
sneak in an avatar into the Jurian noble family, I don't know.

Washu:
Hmph!! She didn't have an avatar. Think about it! Do you two seriously 
believe that she could create, much less manage and develop, an avatar?!

Tokimi:
I suppose you're right, as usual. Afterall, she is the youngest, and I 
have to depend on bumbling fools to do my work for me.

Tsunami:
And my experiment almost blew up in my face.

Washu:
As I've said hundreds of times, "I'M THE BEST!!"

Tokimi & Tsunami:
Yeah, yeah, we know.

Tokomi:
By the way, where is she anyways? She said she was coming. I can't
beleive
you two could stay in that dimension that long with her around.

Washu:
You think it was intentional?

Tsunami:
I think she's on her way. Should be here soon.

Washu:
Unless she stopped somewhere to destroy another dimension.

Mihoshi:
HI!!!! I'm sorry that I'm late!! I just got caught and <trips> Owwww!!!
That 
hurt!!! Hey! is that new dimension supposed to look like that?

Washu:
Looks like we're off again.

Tsunami:
It was nice having tea again.

Tokimi:
It was nice while it lasted.

Mihoshi:
You're leaving again? So soon? But I just got here! Where are you going?
Can I come too? Wait, just let me get my . . .

END


Notes:
 
So, Mihoshi is the fourth sister. I guess the idea comes from how lucky
she is in the OAV. She has incredible marksmanship, she's able to
traverse
dimensions, even into Washu's lab, and her amazing cube. Anyways, hope
you
enjoyed reading my first fan fic. Comments and suggestions at
