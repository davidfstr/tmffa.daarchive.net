Except for Turbo Magnus and the Anime Star, nothing used in this story is my
property. I'm not paying to use the characters, nor am I making money from
them.

Anime Star MSTs #3
By: Turbo Magnus

(Author: This takes place right after MST #2. And yes, I know Ksawarrior
does Tank Cop, but THIS needed immediate attention. LET THE MSTING BEGIN!!!)
[MST Starts]

"Full House, aces over sixes. I win." Jay ‘Turbo' Magnus, as Turbo Magnus
was called when human, said, laying out the winning hand of the poker game.

"But... But... HOW!?!" Crow T. Robot shouted.

"Simple. We were playing Hours, remember, threes, twos, sixes, and queens
were wild. I had an ace, a three, a queen, and two sixes, just be glad I
didn't use five aces."

"Nooooo! It's not fair!"

(That's not all that's unfair you know.)

"Who is THAT?!" Relena Darlian, who had just recently joined the crew and
had never heard the Author pulling his "Magic Voice act."

"Just the Author." everyone else said, not even blinking.

(That's me. I know you just finished a MST, but I'm sending another one.)

The crew was shocked, the Author had never done THIS.

"Why?" Washu asked.

(It's an unMSTed Tank Cop misc fic. I was scanning TMFFA and found it.)

"But doesn't Ksawarrior do Tank Cop's fics?" Tom Servo wondered.

(Yeah, but this isn't super-sick. It's just a bunch of never written fics.
You're MSTing it because two of the ideas have sickened even me.)

"Now THAT'S gross." Turbo, knowing his Author and the Author's limits, said.

(Extremely.)

[[[MY KINGDOM FOR AN INTELLIGENT OCTOPUS!]]]
And in the best tradition of MSTers everywhere, the crew said as one,
"AHHH!!! WE GOT FANFIC SIGN!!!"

Door Sequence:
Door 1: A dimensional tunnel through Washu's lab.

Door 2: South Gate from FFIX, they ride golden chocobos through.

Door 3: The Wing Gundam is blocking the way, Heero self-detonates and they
walk by.
RELENA: Heero...
TURBO: He sees you as a target he just can't shoot, get over him.
RELENA: Heero...

Door 4: The Cursed Springs of Jusenyko, they walk around them.

Door 5: An asteroid heading for Earth, Turbo just pulls a pulse cannon out
from subspace/hammerspace and blasts it.
TURBO: In honor of almost every Gundam series.

Hello I'm Tank Cop.
TURBO: Die.
WASHU: Go to hell.
TOM: Eat a bag of hell.
CROW: Drink bleach.
RELENA: I take it he's not exactly liked.
TURBO: I'd sooner become friends with Heero than even consider Tank Cop as
human.
RELENA: That's a bit harsh.
WASHU: Not harsh enough.

And I'd like to welcome you to this special fanfic.
Why is it so special you ask?

CROW(Tank Cop): Becuase in this fic I announce my diseion to comit suecide.
(Normal) That was misspelled in an attempt to mock Tank Cop.

Its because I'm not here to do a Sasami Lemon

TURBO: No apostrophe for It's.
RELENA(Shaken): A... Sasami lemon? That cute little girl from Tenchi Muyo!?
TOM(Grim): Yep.
RELENA(darkly): Tank Cop, you have my full permission to die.

story! I'm here to tell you about the stories or ideas that I had that never
made it.

WASHU: If these are worse then those that have, we're in trouble.

If any of you writers out there want to take some of these ideas go ahead
and have them.
There are an assortment of Regulars, Crossovers, Lemon, and many more!
I will explain them in this order: title, type, parts, who's in it, story,
and why it didn't work.

TOM: Because you wrote them.

Now sit back relax and as I the great Tank Cop

ALL: *cough*bullshit*cough*

present:
Tenchi Muyo Fanfics That Never Were! Part 1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Title: Earth/Jurain War

TURBO: Oh...
CROW: ...shit.
WASHU: It's spelt Jurian.

Type: Crossover
Parts: Six or Seven
Who's in it: Tenchi gang, Ranma ½ gang, Salior Moon gang, Devil Hunter Yohko
gang, and Guyver

TURBO: You know, I have a friend who's Dark Guyver...
RELENA: Relevance?
WASHU: Relevance is irrelevant in a Tank Cop fic.

Story: In this reality the Jurain Empire is a evil planet taking Empire.
When they arrive on Earth they are met with heavy resistance.

CROW: Maybe if they weren't attacking the Internet...

Many of Earths hero's fight and die in the four year war that will be called
The Earth Jurain War. In the end the Earth is bombarded from space by the
Jurain Warships.

RELENA: I thought the Jurians used TREEships...

The Earth surrenders after three day of attack.

TOM: It's dayS, plural.

Five years later a rebillion forms from what's left of Earth's hero's. Later
they attack and final

TOM: FinalLY.

force the Jurains to leave Earth and never return.

TURBO(Cheetor): Until next time!

Why it didn't work: The story was way to complicated. I couldn't think of
where to put all these hero's in the story. I was just to much for me to put
into a series.

TOM: ToO.
TURBO: Tom, must you do that?
TOM: You're right, I'd most likely be exhausted before we were through.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Title: Family Bussiness

CROW: So it's about the Mafia?
TURBO(Italian accent): Perhaps we should make Tenchi... an offer he can't
refuse.

Type: Crossover
Parts: One
Who's in it: Tenchi, Ryoko, Aeka, Sasami, Yosho, Devil Hunter Yohko and
family
Story: Yosho's siter in law

WASHU: So it's Yosho's babysitter's husband?

Mutilda Mono and her family come down to visit. Yosho and Mutilda know each
others secrets. But the others don't know that Yohko is a Devil Hunter or
that Tenchi is a Half Jurain, or this his friends are aliens. They enjoy a
day outside when a demon comes to break up there fun, but its the demon who
is the one who's in for it.

RELENA: For unbeknownst to them, Sakura was nearby and had become the
Slayer.
TURBO: ReLeNa, PlEaSe, DoN't UsE aNy ShIn TeNcHi ReLaTeD jOkEs, It Is NoT
gOoD fOr WhAt LiTtLe SaNiTy I hAvE!
RELENA: Sorry Turbo.

Why it didn't work: I just couldn't find the right way to start this story
and it just faded away.

TOM(Hawkeye Pierce): "Meanwhile, Aunt Martha, having taken a tramp through
the woods, lies in a ditch on the edge of town..."
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Title: The Hunted

TURBO: Who hunts the hunters?

Type: Regular
Parts: One
Who's in it: Tenchi, Ryoko, Jack (New)

WASHU: PLEASE! Don't let it be a SI!
TURBO: And what's wrong with Sis?
WASHU: Nothing when they don't warp reality.

Story: After a fight between Tenchi and Ryoko, Ryoko leaves the house and
promise never to come back. On her way out she is shot with a tranquilizer
dart and taken to a island where her powers don't work!

WASHU: Im-Possible.

He knows that she is an alien, and gives her a chance to make it off the
island if she can make it to a ship about five miles away. If she dosen't
make it she dies. And a deadly game of cat and mouse begins!

CROW: With Ryoko as the cat.

Ryoko later kills the Jack,

TOM: So now he's a playing card?
TURBO(card shark): Royal family wild!

and makes it home where Tenchi is worried and waiting for her.
Why didn't it work: I just couldn't see Ryoko running for her life. She
would rather kill Jack with her bare hands then run.

WASHU: Your analysis is correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Title: I Chose You Ryo-Ohki

TURBO(Pissed off Pikachu): PIKACHU!!!!

Type: Crossover

Then comes out three kids and a Pokemon!

TOM: And how the hell does the Tenchi gang know it's a Pokemon?

They get to the house and ask if they have seen Ryo-Ohki!

RELENA: Why does he use all of these exclamation points?
TURBO: A theory of Ksa's is that he thinks it makes his writing more
exciting.

The Sasami asks why they want to see Ryo-Ohki. They are tell them

CROW(Gigabyte): I am become Gigabyte, destroyer of systems.

that Ryo-Ohki is Pikachu's wife! She was She was

RELENA: Is he trying to rap now?

taken from him many years ago and left in this world with no memory of her
past life.

go out for a little R&R!

But there happy reunion is cut short by Team Rocket who also finds there way
thew the portal.

TOM: Check please! *Self-destructs head*
CROW: He blew himself up...

And kiddnaps Ryo-Ohki in a Pokeball.

RELENA: Why doesn't she just change to her ship form and break the ball?

They tell them they can have Ryo-Ohki back if they give them Pikachu.
Pikachu agrees. Before Pikachu is taken into he tells Ryo-Ohki that he will
return to her some day. Team Rocket takes pikachu and escapes into the
portal. Ash and the rest say good bye and promise to find Pikachu and bring
him back. They leave and the portal closes. Ryo-Ohki will never forget her
lover Pikachu or and the child that he gave her!

*The crew dives for the barf bags thanks to that mental image.*
ALL: *BAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFF!*
Why it didn't work: Ash, and the rest are to stuiped to know what a portal
is let alone know how to use one. And if RYo-Ohki is so important Team
Rocket would just let her go.

TURBO: He even types non-lemons one-handed!
ALL: *BAAAARRRRRRRFFFFF!*
----------------------------------------------------------------

MIND!!!

But is Tenchi strong enough to fight the temptations of the Dark Side?

TURBO: If Ryoko is the Dark Side, no.

Why it didn't work: It was a good idea but a bad timing. The Phatom Meance
was out and it just killed the story.

Why it didn't work: I had a good opening, but the story was not going any
where. It had no real plot. So it died.

stop her, by killing her! But can they do what must be done before it is to

[Fic ends]
[Relena, Turbo, and Washu storm out leaving Crow in the pit and Tom
off-line.]

"HOAG! Get Epyon, Noble, and a Shield Liger on-line. We're going to war."
Turbo ordered the second he got out.

*Minutes later, in the Gundam/Zoid Bay.*

"Turbo here, Epyon ready for drop."

"Relena, prepped to deploy Noble."

"Washu-Chan, mobilizing Shield Liger."

"Roger that, just remember, if the Liger's shield fails you'll be uncloaked
and visible."

"Noted, launch."

As the Anime Star took up a low Earth orbit, Shield Liger, Noble, and Epyon
jumped out of the bay, landing in front of Tank Cop's house.

"More bad grammar! More Sasami lemons! MORE MORE MORE!!!"

Washu's voice came over the com system, "Sounds like we have the right
house."

"Do you ladies wish to do the honors?" Turbo asked.

"Love to." Relena replied as the spare Heat Rod Noble was using was raised
above its head and came crashing down on Tank Cop's house.

"WHAT THE FUCK!?! WHO ARE YOU!?" Tank Cop screamed from inside the remains.

"We are the crew of the Anime Star, the one in the blue cat is Washu-chan,
the pilot of the one that looks like a sailor scout is Relena, and I am
Turbo. You can call us the repo team. Your life is about a dozen fics
overdue." Turbo said as he brought Epyon's Heat Rod down cutting off Tank
Cop's escape. "Washu-chan, I think Shield Liger is hungry..."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evil me leaving off right at the end huh? I thought I'd let you guys decide
what happens to Tank Cop in your own minds. Like I said at the beginning, I
felt this fic had to be MSTed quick. Flames, thanks, comments, and criticism
