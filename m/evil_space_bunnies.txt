      The wind picked up to a savage roar and threw Tenchi Masaki backwards
against the wall as a horde of blazing eyes closed in, and he swallowed
heavily, throwing every ounce of his strength into the dim shield of jurai
power he had manifest.
     He just prayed that the girls were alright...Ryoko haddn't looked well,
and Aeka had been staggering, bleading from a dozen wounds..Mihoshi had
fallen in the first wave of the assault, Sasami was missing and Washuu was
incoherant...dazed.
     Things looked very bad.
     Thunder slamed into his light hawlk wings in a thousand vollies,
blasting him throught the wall of the shrine and tumbling him back into the
cave, where they would have to make their last stand.
     The enemy folowed, a vicious, evil horde of tiny bodies and vicious
teeth who's terrifying battle cry rang out in a thousand repititions of "Miyah!"
