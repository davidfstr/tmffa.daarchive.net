Disclaimer:     I don't claim.  Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi Universe, Tenchi the
Movie:  Tenchi Muyo in Love, Tenchi the Movie 2: The Daughter of Darkness,
Tenchi in Tokyo, and Tenchi Forever are all at least in some part property
of Pioneer LDC and AIC and their original creators.  The original song is
property of Good Charlotte, who in turn is property of Epic Records Groups,
who in turn is property of a bunch of people who make more in a week than
I make all year.  This fic and a couple cheap folders full of pictures of
mermaids and cat-girls are property of Jake the Goose,but I am willing to
share.
     If you're trying to put this in a certain continuity, you might as
well try to pour cottage cheese in a light socket.  'Cuz if you do, the
only thing you'll manage to do is get pretty good fried cottage cheese, I
mean A.F.U.ed. Have GOT to stop steeling lines from friends.

Ditch:     Now For some Theme Music!
     Don't care about a thing today
     I used to but I'm fed up
     And I can hear the words you say
     I wish that you would shut up
     I got responsibility
     That is my liability
     A menace to society
     At least that's what they said of me
Goose:     What the hell are you doing!?!  This is a songfic!  We don't
NEED theme music!
Ditch:     But I haven't had a job since "The Inevitable Return of ? ? ?"!
Goose:     Get the fuck outta here!

Tenchi<talking>:     This song is dedicated to anyone who ever crashed
a spaceship.  To anyone who never actually had parents.  To everyone
who's ever been called a freak!  This is for you!
     <Singing>
     Like the time I let that demon out
     And she blew my high school up  (What's that out there!)
     Like the time her boss was actin' out
     So I had to beat him up  (Light Hawk!)
     Like the time mom iced that psychopath
     'Cuz he tried to kill my dad  (Red FUDO!)
     And the girls that try to marry me
     But slowly drive me mad  (Make the voices STOP!)

Chorus (sung by all):     The little things!  Little Things!
     That tend to shock the shrine.
     The Little things! Little things!
     No need to bitch and whine.
     The Little things! Little things!
     Like lying’ in the grass.
     The Little things! Little things!
     Come back to kick my ass
     You wanna hate me now
     But I won't stop now
     'Cuz I can't stop now

Tenchi:     Like the girl who showed up at my house
     And said she was my Kid.  (DADDY)

Ayeka:     Like the time I blew the kitchen up
     'Cuz Ryoko wouldn't quit  (TENCHIIIIIIIIIII!)

Ryoko:     Like the time your sister shot at us
     Now they all think we're queer  (Be friends!)

Sakuya:     Or the time you fell in love with me
     But then I disappeared  (Where'd she get to)


Chorus(sung by all):     The little things!  Little Things!
     That tend to shock the shrine.
     The Little things! Little things!
     No need to bitch and whine.
     The Little things! Little things!
     Like layin' in the grass.
     The Little things! Little things!
     Come back to kick my ass
     You wanna hate me now
     But I won't stop now
     'Cuz I can't stop now

     The Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!  Little Things!
     Little Things!
     Here we GO!

Tenchi:     And it always seems those little things
     They take the biggest part of me Break down
     I'm breakin' down
     Im breakin', dooooowwwwwwnnnnnnn

Author's notes:     This was thrown together to try to kick down a pretty
big writer's block.  With moderate success.  Now to get back to trying
fics with plots, but that's harder than I thought.
SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION:     Come to my fan art site!  A lot of it ain't
too bad.
