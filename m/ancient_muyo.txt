HI! It's me, and I've got something really dumb for you to check out! This is 
just a silly script format fic about what it would be like if Tenchi never chose 
a girl and the gang aged like normal humans! I wrote this on a message board, so 
it's a bit silly and may have a few misspelled words, but I thought it was kinda 
cute! So enjoy!

An aged Tenchi walks into his home, cane and all.
Almost immediatly Ryoko rushes at a whole 2 mph at Tenchi, bowling him over and 
breaking her hip.
Ryoko: Oh, Tenchi! Come share a bottle of prune juice with me! 
Aeka enters slowly, supported by her slightly younger sister.
Aeka (in a quiverring old lady voice): Ryoko! You leave Lord Tenchi alone! Stop 
trying to seduce him, you evil demon beast! Oh, my back!
Washu walks in, a long gray beard dangling to the floor and a big wooden cane in 
one hand. She hits Aeka and Ryoko over the head with the wooden stick.
Washu: Everyone (cough) knows I'm (cough) the girl for (cough) Tenchi! (wheez) 
I'm just so (cough) kawaii! (wheez, cough, sneeze)
Mihoshi chooses this moment to cause an explosion in Washu's lab, causing the 
scientist to have a heart attack and fall back on her butt, dead.
Nobuyuki now enters in his wheel chair- a blanket on his lap and a camcorder in 
his hand.
Nob.: Oh, Tenchi! Smile!
Ryoko is still lying on Tenchi since she broke her hip and cannot move. She 
starts rubbing her saggy body against Tenchi, elisiting a cry of horror from the 
gray haired old man.
Tenchi: Ryoko! Stop it! I need my medication! Get off of me! (snorts into a 
hankerchief)
Aeka: You leave Lord Tenchi alone! I will destroy you!
Aeka now energizes her power logs, and prepares to trap Ryoko in a forcefield.
Aeka: Prepare to die!
The logs come to life, giving Ryoko static cling. Then they dissapear and Aeka 
wheezes from the strain.
Ryoko: Oh no... Now I need to use Snuggle! You know how much I hate those little 
sheets! You'll pay princess!
Tenchi sweat drops.
Ryo-Ohki now enters, limp-hopping up to Tenchi and begging for some mashed 
carrots. 
The entire house starts to rumble as *gasp* the Soja flies above the house. The 
crippled form of Kagato materializes in front of Tenchi, and accidentally farts.
Kagato: Oooops... Anyway! Prepare to die, Tenchi! I have finally managed to 
resurrect myself from death, and I will destroy you all! (Kagato now sneezes, 
causing another fart to escape his body) Damn medecine! I can't control my wind!
Tenchi sits up, Ryoko is now under Kagato's control. Ryoko manages to fire one 
small ball of energy at Tenchi's foot before she has to go find some prune juice 
for her bowels. Tenchi now has only one foot, which he uses to kick Kagato in 
the knee. Kagato crumbles, farts sounding from his body as if he were a tuba. 
Kagato: You may have (fart) defeated me now- but (fart) I will have my revenge 
upon you! Beware the powers of Kagato, you foolish boy.. I mean old man! (fart, 
fart, fart)
Kagato then is beamed back up to the Soja, and makes his get away. Tenchi stands 
on his one good foot, using dead Washu's cane, and goes off to the kitchen to 
make Ryo-Ohki some carrot mush.

~The End~
