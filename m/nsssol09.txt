I do not own any characters.  Maze is property of Sunrise Sculptors.

*************
MST#9-Chewy wanted me to.  And by the way.A-A-A-A-A-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-
R-R-R-R-R!
*************
(In the same ol' castle, viewing the same ol' desert.)
<Vegetta> (cracking knuckles) Oh.this pisses me off!
<JS> It isn't even fighting!  I mean, listen to those sound effects!
(JS and Vegetta are watching the 26th episode of Maze: Mega-Burst 
Space!)
<Vegetta> You're right!  It sounds like those space guns from the crappy 
Japanese Prince of Space!
<JS> Yeah well, Tom, Mike, and Crow still have it better than us.
(They continue to watch, then Vegetta's shoulders start to twitch)
<Vegetta> I can't take it anymore! (stands up) I'm going to show those 
pansies what REAL energy is like!  You coming idiot?!
<JS> (also stands up) Hundred percent behind you!
<Vegetta> Good.  Now MOVE IT!
(Vegetta and JS sprint out of the room, into the main lobby with 
everybody else sitting around, they fly down another hallway.  Everybody 
watches nervously)
<Ryoko> They finally snapped.
<Ranma> At least we don't have to hear them arguing with the show.
<Asuka> (continues to read, then a light bulb pops over her head) Idea!  
Joe isn't here to make perverted comments, and Vegetta isn't here for 
the sarcasm, let's say we watch a GOOD fic for once.
<All> HERE HERE!
<Ryoko> Ryoko's Love!
<Ranma> Aikan Muyo!
<Asuka> Union!
(Everyone stares nervously at each other)
<Ranma> This is going to be a problem.
<Ryoko> Well what are we going to do?
<Asuka> DBZ style?
<Ryoko> Uh.
<Ranma> Fine, but let me get my fighting clothes on.
<Asuka> (sweatdrop) That's not.
<JS> (appearing all of sudden with Cherry from Saber Marionette J) 
Everyone, this is Cherry.  She will be in command of what story you're 
reviewing today.  Please be good to her, and everything will be fine. 
(rushes down the hall, everyone stares nervously at Cherry, she smiles 
back)
<Ryoko> (running down the hall) Joe!  Wait up!
<Cherry> It's so nice to meet you all.  As you know, I am a very close 
friend of Lime, and she is a member of.K, sa?
<Others> Ksawarrior.
<Cherry> Oh yes.  Anyway, I know what this is you do, and I understand 
everything clearly.
<Asuka> By the way, how are things now that Lime's gone?
<Cherry> Lonely, but since she has been gone, I've been able to get 
closer to Master Otaru.  Saaaay.(points to Ranma) Do you got a fiancee?
<Ranma> (holds up four fingers) Four.
<Cherry> (sweatdrop).....Okay.  How about that other guy?
<Asuka> (quickly) Oh he's available.
<Ranma> (smiles evily) You sure?
(Asuka raises her hand at him, he flinches and ducks)
<Cherry> Wonderful!  Now it is only a matter of betting Bloodberry to 
fall in love with.
<Asuka> Uh, he's not a Bloodberry fan.  He likes her, but I doubt he 
would fall for her.  And vice-versa.
<Cherry> (looks dissapointed) Oh, shoot.  (she stares at the ground, 
then she smiles and blushes) Oh my.  Now I get it.  Well I'll have to 
let him down.  I know it's so hard for someone as beautiful as me to 
have to deal with all my fan.
<Asuka> (smiling nervously; sweatdrop) Uh.he's more of a Luchs, Tiger 
person. (Cherry face-faults)
<Cherry> (getting up) Hmph!  Just because they have breasts the size 
of.(stops herself) Anyway, may I inquire what fics you have already 
reviewed.
<Jim> (walking by with a large notebook; monotone) All of the fics we 
reviewed, all of our special guests, and all possible fics we should 
review.
<Cherry> (quickly looks through book) Oh my goodness!  This is awful!  
Tramps for special guests!  And what's this.PEDOPHILE LESBIANS!  Well 
that's not right!  Hey, what's this? (looks at a paper, a smile erupts) 
Oh.this looks beautiful!  We must watch this fic!  And I know who should 
be here. (she walks off, talking to herself, Ranma and Asuka stare at 
her nervously)
<Asuka> I think I have a pretty good idea on who she's going to invite.
<Ranma> Oh yeah.  Who?
<Asuka> Well, let's just say you would feel uncomfortable around them.at 
least like that.
<Ranma> What do you mean?
*SPLOOSH!*
<Ranma> (female) Oh no!  Not again!

(Over a vast forest, Ryoko, JS, and Vegetta fly quickly to the 
battleground) 
<Ryoko> (to JS) You sure we're in the right episode?
<JS> Episode twenty six!  Battle for Plutonia!
<Vegetta> What a ridiculous name for a country!
<Ryoko> Like Planet Vegetta is any better.
(Vegetta growls at her, then they hear small explosions)
<JS> Oh, we're here.
(They fly towards the ground and land, all around them men are fighting 
with swords, and Demiarmor's are firing laser's at each other, everyone 
takes a fighting stance)
<Vegetta> Grr.just LOOKING at these weaklings makes me want to kill them 
all!
<Ryoko> I think I can take most of them. 
<JS> Uh.guys.(looks around) Who do we fight?
(Everyone drops their stances, and looks nervously around)
<Ryoko> Gee, they all look the same.
<Vegetta> No, no.  There are distinct blue and brown markings on their 
uniforms.
<JS> Then who gets who?
<Ryoko> I want the mobile things!
<Vegetta> Fat chance!  I am not fighting a bunch of weaklings!
<Ryoko Why don't you get over your ego trip?!
<Vegetta> As soon as you get Tenchi!
<Ryoko> That may be sooner than you think!
<JS> You know what, I want the armor's too.  So let's decide this with a 
fight, DBZ style.
<Vegetta> (sternly) Good idea!
<Ryoko> I get you now.
(Everyone faces each other and gets in a fighting stance)
<JS> (close up on his face) Ready.(close up of Vegetta's face) 
Set.(close up on Ryoko's face) GO!

******************

(Asuka and Ranma walk into the theater, Ranma is carrying a large tub of 
popcorn, several dozen bars of candy, and a pillow in his mouth.  They 
are stupified to see Cherry, Melfina, Belldandy, and Kasumi, sitting in 
that order)
<Melfina> Hello.
<Belldandy> Good day.
<Kasumi> Nice to meet you.
<Cherry> You can sit next to me.
(Ranma takes a seat near Cherry,  Asuka next to her)
<Asuka> (whispering to Ranma) Vegetta would have a heart attack.
<Ranma> (whispering back) I think he'd die on eye contact.
<Cherry> Who's your friend, Asuka?
(Ranma goes to say something but stopped by Asuka) 
<Asuka> She's a friend of mine from school, nothing to worry about.
(Ranma glares at her, Cherry smiles)  
<Cherry> Well it's nice to meet you.
<Ranma> (sweatdrop) Pleasure.
(Kasumi giggles, then the lights dim)
<Belldandy> Shh, it's starting.

>Forever united.

<Melfina> Aw.even the title is sweet.
<Asuka> (to Ranma) I can still hear Vegetta gagging.

>By Chewy

<Kasumi> Wasn't that the name of a character on Star Wars?
(Chewbaca's roar is heard through the loudspeakers, everyone looks back 
to Jim)
<Jim> (nervously) Sorry, force habit.

>Billriddle1@home.com
>Cross over: Evanglion fic with Tenchi Characters.
 
<Asuka> Great, I'm really going to get screwed over on this one.
 
>Disclaimer: I don't own any of this, Evangelion or Rei, 

<Asuka> Knew it.

>heck I don't own the computer, I have no money, and I have no desire to 
have money in >gross amounts.

<Melfina> The poor guy.
<Asuka> (to Ranma) What a loser.

>No, I am not stoned. 

<Kasumi> Stoned?
<Ranma> (acts like he's sniffing something, holds his hand towards 
Asuka) 'Ere.
<Asuka> (pushes hands away) I thought we'd leave the stupid jokes to 
Joe.
<Ranma> Sorry, it's actually kinda boring without him.

>I will try to keep the all people in character. I support the idea of 
Shinji and Rei being >together. She did die for him that one time, kind 
of a hint. 

<Melfina> That is so sweet!
<Cherry> I would do the same for Master Otaru.
<Bell> And I for Keiichi.
(Asuka and Ranma look at them strangely)

>Disregard everything from episode 23 and on, along with the movies, 
except for the part >were Rei realizes she really likes Shinji.  Both 
ending were not worthy of EVA.

<Kasumi> I've never seen the show, what happens?
<Asuka> Boom.
(Evryone else gets a sweatdrop)

>Chewy Productions is greatly honored to present for the first time in 
recorded
>history: 

<Asuka> (sarcastic excitement) Since 1995!

>The Ayanami/Ikari Wedding. I would like to thank Jeffrey "Oneshot" Wong
>and Jusenkyo Guide for this one. 

<Asuka> "Oneshot?" Sounds like Joe.
<Bell> Who? 
<Ranma> The owner of this castle.
<Melfina> It looks like he has good taste.
<Asuka> Ever seen his room?

>Thanks guys ^_^. 

<Cherry> Guys?  We're all girls here.
<Ranma> Well in actuality I'm a.(stops as Asuka covers up her mouth)
<Jim> (from booth) And I don't remember getting a castration anytime 
soon!
(Asuka covers her mouth to prevent from throwing up, Ranma pats her back 
and stares nervously at Belldandy)

>I also don't own Tenchi or Sasami or Tsunami. Kasami is the Child of 
Sasami/Tsunami >and Tenchi. She has blue hair like her mother. 

<Ranma> (as Kiyone) What is it about that electric blue hair everyone 
keeps talking about?
<Asuka> Union riff everybody.
<Cherry> Shh!  It's starting.

>I made her up. No, I do not write lemons. They are usually in really 
bad taste. 
 
<JS> (from loudspeakers) I resent that!
(Everyone stares nervously at Jim)
<Jim> Sorry.  Joe wanted me to play that whenever anybody said that.
<Melfina> What's a lemon?
<Asuka> Shwing.
<Ranma> Splurrt.
(The others get a sweatdrop)

>Deep in Terminal Dogma, a ceremony was being held. A ceremony that's 
beginning had >started seven years earlier.

<Bell> How can something begin if it started seven years earlier?
<Ranma> (whispering to Cherry) I thought you said this was a good fic.

>On a day when a girl willingly put herself in front of a boy whom she 
barely knew so >that he could get a clear shot,

<Kasumi>Clear shot of what?
<Asuka> (to Ranma) That's what I asked myself too.

>A day when a boy had opened that same girl's entry hatch alone to 
rescue her. 

<Jim> It was slippery, but he made it through.
<Asuka, Ranma> JIM!
<Others> (cover their mouth's) Oh dear!
<Jim> I'M SORRY!  I'm used to those perverted comments Joe makes!
<Asuka> You want me to call B-Ko?
<Jim> NO!  NO!

>It was the day of Rei Ayanami's marriage to Shinji Ikari (and vise 
versa). 

<Ranma> Seven years.that would make them.twenty one!
<Asuka> You can do math?!
(Ranma glares at her, the others giggle)

>In a small room that had once been the meeting place where generals and 
strategists had
>sat to plan for war now housed a small chapel. 

<Melfina> Well.I guess it's romantic to come back to the place you spent 
a lot of time in.

>This chapel was where two souls were soon to be united into one unit, 
the sacred unit of >husband and wife, which no angel or demon or any 
other being, cosmic or otherwise, >could separate. 

<Bell> (eyes glimmering) What a beautiful style of words!  I'm going to 
love this!
<Ranma> (to Asuka) Like a bad case of hemorrhoids.

>The people, whom had come from far and wide to witness this 
extraordinary event, >were seated. The lights lowered slightly and a 
Japanese wedding march began to play. 

<Cherry> So beautiful.
(Asuka and Ranma stare at them nervously, Jim turns to a camera)
<Jim> This is going to get real boring, and I know you're dying to find 
out what's happening to Joe and the others.

**********************

(In Plutonia.)
<All> ONE.TWO.THREE!
(Ryoko, Vegetta, and JS are duking it out.DBZ style.  They have gathered 
a remarkably large crowd)
<Blue Soldier> How long have they've been doing this?
<Brown Soldier> About three hours now.
<All> One.Two.Three!
<Brown> Who's winning?
<Blue> I don't know.
<Other Blue> I've never seen any game like this.
<All> One.Two.Three!
<Brown> What are they fighting for?
<Other Brown> (shrugs) Beats me.
<All> One.two.three!
<Blue> Look at the sweat running down their faces.
<Brown> I know.  It must be tiring.
<All> ONE.TWO.THREE!
<Vegetta> HA!  Paper covers rock!
(This is the time for the readers to face-fault)
<JS> Aw.
<Ryoko> Fine, you won fair and square Vegetta.
<Vegetta> (smiles) You know you should never challenge ANY Z fighter to 
a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
<Ryoko> Yeah, yeah, I hear ya'.
<JS> So Ryoko, which group do you want?
<Ryoko> Doesn't matter.  But.the Brown group looks pretty strong.
(All the soldiers in brown flinch)
<JS> Alrighty!  I got the Blue's Brother's!
(All the soldier's in blue flinch)
<Vegetta> This better not be a waste of my time. (flies off towards 
several Demiarmor's)
<JS> (rolling up his sleeve; as Ricky Ricardo) Lucy!  I'm ho-ome!

***********

<Jim> This is going to be a looong day.

>The crowd looked to the back of the room and watched in awe as the 
bride walked >down the aisle.

<Kasumi> What a lovely dress.
<Bell> She looks wonderful in it.
<Asuka> (to Ranma) Looks as if her breasts grew with her too.

>Rei was dressed in a lavender dress that caught the eye of all present, 
including the >priest. 

<Jim> (as priest) Just wait till I get to 'if anyone has any 
objections.'

>She had grown in the past seven years. She now wore her hair in a 
ponytail that went >down to her shoulders. She had grown about 10 
centimeters and her figure had filled out >exceptionally well.

<Cherry> That's pretty much for seven years.
<Ranma> I didn't think an an-(stops as Asuka covers up her mouth, she 
points to Melfina)

>She walked with a grace of a person who could be call euphoric. The 
person escorting >her down the aisle was none other than Maya Ibuki. 
Maya had volunteered after Rei had >not been able to find anyone with 
the dignity to be her escort down the aisle. 

<Melfina> But why?  A wedding is a beautiful thing.
<Asuka> Gendo?  No, that's just wrong.
 
>As they reached the altar, Rei looked into the eyes of her beloved and 
smiled. She had >fought so hard and waited so long for this day to come. 
She remembered when she had >first slapped Shinji for insulting his 
father. 

<Bell> Why anyone would want to insult their father.
<Asuka> I would have kissed him for it...(the others stare at her 
nervously) What?  He's almost as bad as Joe.

>She remembered how after Gendo's disappearance, Shinji was there to 
lend her his >should to cry upon when for the first time in her life she 
had felt grief. Shinji was >always there for her and now he always would 
be her side, night or day, 

<All> In sickness and in health.

>well or sick, 

<Asuka> See?  Isn't it a little fun?
<Kasumi> I guess so.

>rich or poor, heaven or hell, for all eternity.

(Fire shoot from the floor, and a large figure with red and black skin 
pops up, everyone except Asuka and Ranma are scared) 
<Devil> (turns to Asuka) Where's the owner of this place?
<Asuka> (points outside) He's on vacation.
<Devil> Well.when he gets back, tell him to stop sending me e-mails!  I 
am NOT, shoving pineapples up Hitler's ass!
<Ranma> What are you doing to him then?
<Devil> Uh.classified information. (looks at Belldandy, nods to her) 
Ma'am.(disappears in the flames)
<Bell> Uh.
<Asuka> Don't worry.  Joe made a deal with him not to bother us, and 
that includes sending us to you-know-where.
<Bell> But still.!

>Her smile brightened at this thought. Shinji, he was the only boy she 
had every loved, >ever would love, ever will love! 

<Melfina> "Every loved?"
<Cherry> Maybe a 'y' is where it shouldn't be.  Or a 'd'.

>He had shown her that life was very much worth living, that even in the 
darkest night, a >candle still burns for those who seek it. 

<Asuka> Once upon a midnight dreary.

>Before she had Shinji, she had known no true emotions, only negative 
ones and these >were not the emotions that she was feeling now. They 
were of hopelessness, sadness, >anger, fear and depression. 

<Cherry> Aw.the poor girl.
<Melfina> I know how she feels.

>She knew that even with Shinji by her side, life would not be perfect, 
but they would at >least face them together. She offered her hand to 
Shinji and clasped it gently but firmly >with his own. Rei then turned 
and faced the altar, a look of joy on her face.

<Kasumi> She looks so happy.
<Bell> I just know that'll be me and Keiichi later.
(Asuka and Ranma stare nervously at them)
<Ranma> (to Asuka) They're even making me a little woozy.
<Asuka> It almost makes me wish that we were reviewing a bad fic.
<Jim> (frightened) WE GOT COMPANY!
(The lights all of a sudden fade out as everyone is left in darkness)
<Bell> What's happening?!
<Kasumi> I'm frightened!
<Ranma> Jim.what's going on?
<Jim> The mysterious taskmaster is trying to hack into our computer 
mainframe!  I don't know, but this is bad!
<Asuka> How bad is bad?!
<Jim> (as Bob) This is bad.this is really, bad.

---

>"Tenchi, you are a loser!" taunted a menacing voice.

<Melfina> Where are we?
<Jim> This is a completely different fic.and by the look of it, it isn't 
Aikan Muyo.
<Asuka> It's a lemon?!
<Jim> (faintly) Yes.
<Asuka> Well try to get the other fic back!
<Ranma> "Taunted a menacing voice." (frightened) That sounds so 
familiar.too familiar.
(The other four girls are holding onto each other tightly)

>"Huh? What the fuck! Where am I?" said Tenchi as he looked around at 
unfamiliar >surroundings.

<Ranma> Tenchi swearing in his first line, this isn't right!
<Cherry> That is such an atrocious word!  Why would anyone want to use 
it?
<Jim> (very faintly and VERY frightened) Guys.

>"You are on a plate of sashimi," said the voice.

<Kasumi> (eases up on the other girls) What's a plate of sashimi?
<Ranma,Asuka> (scared beyond belief) TURN IT OFF JIM!  TURN IN OFF!
<Jim> (slamming buttons on the keyboard) I'M TRYING DAMMIT!
<Melfina> Please, what is a .
<Ranma,Asuka> GET US OUT OF HERE NOW!
<Jim> BUT THE GUNS ARE ONLINE!
<Ranma,Asuka> DESTROY THE CIRCUIT BOARD!
<Jim> But.
<Ranma,Asuka> JUST DO IT!
<Jim> (reaches in and grabs a bunch of wires) This is gonna hurt.(he 
rips out the wires, and immediately, electricity runs through his body, 
he screams in pain, which actually sounds like R2-D2) 
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW! (his body is 
flown against the wall, but the door in the theater opens, Asuka and 
Ranma grab two ladies)
<Ranma,Asuka> RUN!

*****************

(Back in Plutonia, Vegetta punches a Demiarmor, causing it to shatter 
into many pieces)
<Vegetta> (trying to control his anger) There are still fifty left.maybe 
they'll give me a challenge. (he flies off to some more Demiarmor's)
(Ryoko punches a soldier, he goes flying into the distance)
<Ryoko> This.is boring.
(JS grabs a guy by the arm, swings him around, and throws him into 
space)
<JS> This has been a waste of my time. (whistles) Vegetta!  Ryoko!  Come 
here! (the two fly down next to him)
<Ryoko> Well what do we do now? (lifts up her fist, punching a guy in 
the face)
<Vegetta> Let me just blast them all! (lifts his arm behind him, fires a 
ki blast, vaporizing a bunch of people)
<Ryoko> No way!  I've had just as much fun as you have, I want a turn!
<JS> (puts his hands on her shoulders) Now Ryoko, it's not a good idea 
to make Vegetta fight weak people. (Ryoko glares at him)
<Vegetta> FINE! (lifts up both hands and fires a HUMONGEOUS ki blast, 
which literaly destroys everything in sight, JS and Ryoko stare bug-
eyed)
<Ryoko> (to JS; points to wasteland) You see why you don't let him 
fight?!
<JS> Maybe you overdid it a bit Vegetta.
(Vegetta is twitching with anger, then a ominous blue fog rolls over 
them)
<Gorgeous> (yes folks, that IS his name) You may be strong, but you 
cannot withstand the stregth of my phantom energy.
(Vegetta, Ryoko, and JS, all wearing gas masks, look at each other and 
shrug)
<Gorgeous> So what do you have to say?
(A soft 'whirring' is heard as JS is holding a fan and the fog clears 
from around them, they take off their gas masks)
<Ryoko> Hey.  He's Gorgeous.
<Gorgeous> (blushes) Why, yes I am.(others stare at him nervously)
<Vegetta> (to JS) Exactly how long have you been waiting to use that 
joke?
<JS> Too long.
<Gorgeous> (eye twitching) Well, if you're so strong, why don't you 
attack me then?!
<Ryoko> (sarcstically) Do you want to kick his butt, oh Prince of the 
Strongest Asses in the entire universe.
<Vegetta> Yes I would. (flies off with his arm ready)
(Ryoko and JS watch uninterested as Vegetta beats the shit out of 
Gorgeous's Demiarmor, although they flinch each time metal is shattered 
and they hear screams of pain.  They turn around to see Solude, Randy, 
Rapier, Ashter, Maze, Mil, Ranchiki, and that other little old dude)
<Solude> What the hell are you doing here?!
<Ryoko> (points to Vegetta) Square brithches was a little antzy.
<Gorgeous> No!  Not my hair!
<Maze> Isn't that a bit much? (flinches as a punching sound is heard)
<JS> No, actually Vegetta's going easy on him. (a large explosion is 
heard)
<Mil> Big sister brother!  He's scaring me! (JS flinches as she yells)
<Vegetta> ARGH!  THIS PLANET IS USELESS!
<Ryoko> Uh-oh, he's upset.
<JS> (points to others) You might want to get out of here. 
<Randy> (flies up to his face) But why?
<JS> (smiles nervously) Well, when Vegetta fights a bunch of weaklings, 
he gets upset after he's wiped them all out, so he's attacks the 
strongest person around, and since no one here can match his caliber of 
fighting, he usually destroys the whole planet.
<Maze> HE CAN DESTORY AN ENTIRE PLANET?!
<Ryoko> (taking off) More like an entire galaxy at his full strength, 
provided he has some way to breathe in space.  Joe, you're on your own.
<JS> (sarcastically) Thanks a lot.  Oh, my mediacl insurance is gonna 
soar. (turns around to Vegetta, who is twitching with anger) You alright 
Vegetta?
<Vegetta> (holding the head of the Demiarmor) You promised me a good 
battle!
<JS> Did I?
<Vegetta> (walks up to him) And what.do you plan to do about it?
<JS> (taps his chin) Hmm.you could fight Goku.oh wait, he's dead.
<Vegetta> (grabbing his collar) YOU FIGHT ME THEN!
<Joe> What?!
<Vegetta> You're an SI!  You're supposed to be the strongest in the 
universe!
<JS> Well, actually, I'm not exactly an SI.  I'm a reformed form of the 
author, so I'm more like half a SI.  Besides, ever read my stories? 
(Note: Vegetta is twitching with every second) _I_ know what make's a 
good SI.
<Vegetta> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN!  I CAME HERE FOR A DECENT FIGHT, AND 
BEFORE I LEAVE HERE, I'M GOING TO GET IT!
<JS> Well why are you asking me?  You kicked my ass thousands of times 
before.  What makes now so different?
<Vegetta> I just feel like it.(throws JS over his head, he goes flying 
in the distance as Vegetta chases him)

*****************

 (Back in the main lobby, the only two around are Asuka and Belldandy)
<Bell> That's horrible.
<Asuka> Yep, that's Tenchi on a Plate of Sashimi rolled into that.
<Bell> Where are the other girls?
<Asuka> Well, Ranma's talking to Kasumi, and Jim to Cherry and Melfina.
<Cherry> (offscreen) AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!
<Asuka> Annnnd, Jim seems to have the worst of them.
<Bell> I see.(sips some tea) By the way, where are your friends?  Didn't 
you say there were three more to your little soiree. (Is that how you 
spell it?)
<Asuka> Well, there's Ryoko, she's a little ecentric when it comes to 
Tenchi.  And Vegetta, who's basically stuck-up but no one DARES tell him 
that or he toast's them, and by the way, if you see him any time soon, 
don't be surprised if he pukes all over you. (Belldandy gets a 
sweatdrop) Then.there's Joe.
(As if on cue, JS busts in with Vegetta hanging over his shoulder, he 
lifts up his hand and trumpets play in the background)
<JS> Once again, I, Joe Smith, have conquered all odds, and have 
defeated Prince Vegetta of the Saiyan race, the now SECOND strongest in 
the universe!  HA HA HA!
(Ryoko walks in behind them, Belldandy gets a sweatdrop, Asuka looks 
unsurprised) 
<Asuka> Ryoko, how many times did Joe heal himself before Vegetta passed 
out from exhaustion?
<Ryoko> Two thousand, five hundred and forty nine times.  Not counting 
the ten times Vegetta let him have a free shot. (JS face-faults, Vegetta 
still doesn't wake up)
<Asuka> That's what I thought.
<JS> (sitting cross-legged) You two are no fun. (notices Belldandy, 
quickly rises and bows) Hello Belldandy-sama.
<Ball> (smiles) There's no need for that.
<Asuka> (staring nervously) When did you become so formal?
<JS> Belldandy.number one, do not touch.
<Asuka> Yeah, yeah.
<Bell> Why, what does he usually do to visitors?
<Asuka> Well, depending on what gender they are, he.
<JS> (appears behind Asuka and gives her a BIG hug, with his hand on 
you-know-what) Oh Asuka-chan I love you! (starts shaking her) I love 
you!  I love you!  I.
*KLONG!*
(Bell has a sweatdrop again, Ryoko watches uninterested)
<Ryoko> So, who else is here?
<Bell> That nice young lady from.from.
<Asuka> You mean Melfina?
<Bell> Yes!
<JS> (quickly shoots up) Melfina's in MY castle?!
<Asuka>.....yes.  And Kasumi too.
<JS> (jaw to the floor).........Melfina's HERE?!
(Bell and Asuka nod nervously, he goes sprinting off into a hallway, Jim 
comes walking in, unhappy)
<Jim> Thanks to ME, I made sure Sashimi is over, and I was able to get 
our original fic back on.  Now if you don't mind, I'm going to go gouge 
my eyes out, and cut my ears off.  Bye.
<Bell> (to Ryoko) Would you like to join us?
<Ryoko> I guess.I don't have anything else to do.
<Bell> Wonderful!  Let's go! (she hurries into the theater, Asuka and 
Ryoko blatantly follow)
<Ryoko> Almost seems like she's never been to a movie theater.
<Asuka> We'll have to ask Keiichi what the hell they're doing over 
there.

******************

(Seating order from left to right, Ranma, Asuka, two empty seats [don't 
ask], Ryoko, Bell, Cherry, and Kasumi)
<Cherry> Where is Melfina?  And you're other two friends?
<Ryoko> I know Vegetta's still out from exhaustion, as for Melfina and 
Joe.
(Giggling is heard, as the door opens and Melfina comes in with JS 
clinging around her neck)
<Melfina> (giggles) Stop it!
<JS> I'm serious!
(They take their seats, JS next to Asuka) 
<Melfina> (smiling) He's such a sweetie.
<Asuka> (glaring at JS; motions for him) Joe.come here.
<JS> (leans closer to her) Yes?
*KLONG!*
  
>Shinji watched as Rei walked gracefully down the aisle. She was 
beautiful, the most >beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life. 

<Asuka> (sarcastic) Of course, I'm mentioned nowhere within that.
<JS> (pinches her cheek) Oh, you're such a cutie.
(She tries to hit him with the mallet, but he stops it with his hands.  
They start chukling, and making those "buddy" motions to each other.then 
Asuka punches him)

>Seven years ago, he would not have recognized her. She had grown in so 
many ways; 

<JS> Tell me about it.  Boing! (hit upside the head by Asuka) Dammit!  
Where's Vegetta when I need him?!

>she was no longer an emotionless little girl. She was now a vessel of 
hope and love; 

<JS> The Satellite of Love!
<All> (singing) In the not too distant future.!
<JS> I didn't know you had it in you Mel.
<Melfina> (blinks) Neither did I.
<Cherry> (to Kasumi) What happened there? 
<Kasumi> I really don't know.

>she was what mattered to him most in the entire world. He prayed that 
he would always >be there to protect her, no matter how dark the world 
appeared. 

<JS> Solar eclipse.
<Ranma> Do not look into the sun.

>She was his happiness, the only star in his sky. She was his little Rei 
of sunshine; 

(All original MSTrs face-fault)
<Kasumi> (giggles) That's cute.
<Jim> Guys, the "Corny Meter" exploded.

>she was all he would ever need. Shinji noticed her smiling at him and 
he smiled back. >He then gently took her hand when she offered it to 
him. 

<JS> She had no more use for it. (others snicker)

>He then turned and faced the altar.
 
>Hands clasped together, they turned and faced the altar as one. 

<Ranma> What's worse?  Shampoo narraration, or Mojo Jojo narraration?

>The priest began to speak "Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today 
in the sight of >the almighty to see the holy union of these two young 
people", 

<Bell, JS> CAPATILIZATION! (they stare nervously at each other, then 
look away)

>the priest said with a smile. He could see the love that this man and 
woman had for each >other. That made him smile,

<JS> (as Mojo Jojo) Smile is what he did, because smiling is what he can 
do, because he can smile.
<Asuka> (puts her hand over his mouth) Shut up.

>he glanced over to his daughter who was acting shrine maiden and 
winked. Tenchi was >very proud of his daughter,

<Ryoko> Since when did Tenchi have a daughter?!
<Ranma> Disclamier said she's the daughter of Sasami.
<Ryoko> Oh yeah, of course!  I knew we couldn't get away without some 
form of pedophile!
(Others get a sweatdrop)

>Kasami, who was a spitting image of her mother. Until he had met the 
bride, he thought >that she and his wife, Tsunami was only people on 
earth with blue hair. 

<JS> Bulma, Shampoo, Qawool.
<Asuka> (to Chewy) Don't get us started.

>He knew that the love that these two shared was probably equal to his 
love for Sasami, >or Tsunami as she to those who were not close to her. 

<Kasumi> But those that were not, who want these, were.what happened?
<Jim> Must be that post-MSTing syndrome that affects all those required 
to view a fic.
(Others stare at him nervously)

>He would do anything; give anything, he would happily give his life for 
either of them, >Kasami or Sasami. 

<Asuka> And yet it takes the entire Nerv force to get him into an Eva.
<JS> Aww, go easy on the girly kid.
*BAM!*
(The large, purple Eva fist gets off of JS, everyone gets a sweatdrop)

>Now another couple could hopefully find the happiness that he and 
Sasami had found, it >was his duty as a priest to perform this sacred 
rite.  

<JS> (as Tenchi) Alright, who brought the sheep.
*BAM!*
(Belldandy removes her fist from his cheek)
<Bell> (notices everyone looking at her) Uh.post.anti-hentai reaction. 
(smiles and shrugs)
<Asuka> (looks at Ranma) Works for me.

> Tenchi continued, "Marriage is an institution built on love, honor and 
union of two >souls, two souls that are at present standing before me. 
If there is anyone in this
>room can give cause to why these two may not be wed, speak now or 
forever hold
>they're peace." 

<JS> (as Donkey) That's when you burst in saying, "I object!"
<Ranma> (as Shrek) What?!  I don't have time for this!
<JS> Now now now, hold on.   Do you love this woman?
<Ranma> Yes.
<JS> Do you want to hold her?!
<Ranma> Yes!
<JS> PLEASE her?!
<Ranma> YES!
<JS> Then ya got ta, got ta, try a little TENDERNE-ESS!
*KLONG!*
*KLONG!*
(Asuka mallets them both)

>Several moments past and no one said anything. "Good. Do you
>Rei Ayanami, take Shinji Ikari to be your lawfully wedded husband, to 
honor and
>love, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer or 
poorer as long as
>you both shall live?" 

<JS> I don't remember that last line..although I haven't been to a 
wedding in five years.

>Rei replied, "As long as I draw breath from my body, I swear I
>will love Shinji Ikari until my dying day. I do, with all my heart, I 
do."  

<Asuka> (as Tenchi) One more time, I didn't hear you.

>Tenchi then turned to Shinji and said "Good,

<All> Good?
<Ranma> I wonder what would have happened if she said no.
<Asuka> (as Rei) I'm sorry, I can't.
<JS> (as Tenchi) Are you sure? (gun-cocking noises are heard)

> do you, Shinji Ikari, take Rei Ayanami to be your lawfully wedded 
wife, to honor and >love, to have and to hold, in sickness and in 
health, for richer or poorer as long as you >both shall live?" "Rei is 
my world, 

<All except Asuka> (singing) Hy hopes, my dreams, my everything!
<Asuka> (rubbing temples) Please.I can't stand Savage Gardens.
<JS> (puts his arm around her) How about Savage in Bed?
*KLONG!*

>I will do anything and everything to make her happy. I do." Tenchi then 
motioned to
>Kasami to bring the sake. 

<JS> WHOO-HOO!  IT'S HAPPY HOUR!
*KLONG!*
<Ranma> (as drunk Rei) Yeah.and then I said "I do!"
(Others giggle as a mock, laugh track is played)

>Kasami brought the tray over to the waiting couple and poured them each 
a cup of sake. >After reciting sacred passages, Tenchi said, "Who has 
the ring?" Little Yuki Suzuhara 
>giggled as she brought the rings forward. 

<All> Yuki Suzuhara?
<Ryoko> Better not be Tenchi's kid.
<Cherry> I think that's the first time you spoken in here.
<Ryoko> Naw.I said a couple things as soon as we got in here.

>Tenchi then said " Rei Ayanami, repeat after me. 'With this ring, I 
thee wed.'" Rei >recited "With ring, I thee Wed." he then turned to 
Shinji and said "Shinji Ikari, please >repeat after me. 'With this ring, 
I thee wed.'" 

<Vegetta> (comes stumbling in) Oh my head.  Where is that rotten, pussy, 
healing son of a.(stops as he notices Belldandy) Oh no.  I.I'm having 
the flashes again.  I can see it!  The sweetness!  The.the.THE CUTE!  
THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE CUTE!  I CAN'T STOP THE IMAGES!  OH THE 
INHUMANITY! (starts retching and sprints out of the theather.  The four 
girls in front get a sweatdrop, then turn to the original MSTrs, who 
just shake their heads)

>Shinji then recited "With this ring, I thee wed." Tenchi smiled at Rei 
and Shinji and said >"It is my honor to pronounce you husband and wife, 
you may kiss the bride."

<JS> (excitement) Okay!
(A missile blows up his chair, he flies into the shielded screen, is 
zapped, and is thrown into the back of the theater)
<Asuka> Hey Rei!  I do the hentai bashing here!
<Rei> So?

>In the background, a very pregnant Hikari Suzuhara could be heard 
bawling. The
>kissed, a kiss that united them, body and soul, of all time. 

<Ranma> The kiss that would forever unite them, that would keep them 
united, and blah, de blah, de blah.

>After this was done, Tenchi turned to all those present and said, " It 
is my privilege to >introduce to you, Mr. and Mrs. Shinji and Rei 
Ayanami." There was applause that could >be heard outside of the 
Geofront. Yui Ikari looked down from heaven on to the young >couple and 
smiled, 

<All>.....
<Asuka> He's really getting into this.

>She then turned to Achika Masaki and said, "I told Shinji I was going 
to show him a >bright future." They both burst out laughing.   
 
<Cherry> Such a sweet ending.
<Bell> Wonderful story, except for several interruptions. (looks to the 
fried JS)
 
>The End only of this story, but a true story never ends.

<JS> (healed; as the Lion) Ain't it the truth.  Ain't it the truth.  
Ain't it the truth, and I'm not lion.
<Jim> Ranma, here's some hot water!
<Ranma> (grabs it from mid-air) Thanks! *SPLOOSH!*
<Melfina> You're a guy?!
<Ranma> Sorry, it's a weird curse.
<JS> I don't dare think what would happened if the two collided.  I 
mean, what would Akane think.
(Others stare at him nervously)
<Cherry> Anyway, thank you for having us. (bows) Maybe we can watch 
another cute fic.
<Melfina> (kisses JS's cheek) You were a wonderful host.
<JS> (tapping fingers, blushing) Aww.you're too kind. (blush fades) 
However, if you don't mind bunking with Asuka in the same bed for a 
couple days, then.
(Asuka jumps at him, wraps her legs around his neck, and throws herself 
and JS to the ground)
<Asuka> (trying to break JS's neck) It was nice having you.buh-bye.
<Melfina> (sweatdrop) Okay.
(She walks out with the others, JS's face starts to turn polka-dotted)
<Asuka> You just never give up, do you? (suddenly thrown off as JS 
stands up)
<JS> (hugs her and plants his face in her *EH-HEM!*) But Asuka, you 
know you're the only one for me!
<Asuka> (trying to push him away) I told you.I'M NOT INTERESTED!
<JS> (lets go) But why?!  We're so popular with all the readers!
<Asuka> (shocked) WHAT?!
<JS> (pulls down a chart) In terms of actual relationships, we're more 
popular than you and SHINJI! (points to undistinguishable graph) We're 
almost as high as you and REI!
(Next camera shot is that of the desert outside the castle.  A small 
figure screaming is seen running from them castle, as it is followed by 
a large red, human-like, mecha)

**************

Yes, this story didn't deserve to me MST.  Yes, it wasn't one of my 
best.  And yes, I know I may have screwed some things up when I 
mentioned anything from Evangelion.  But Chewy wanted me to, and I 
don't turn down requests (frankly, because he's the only one to request 
a MST).  Until next time!
