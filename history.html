      This is a short chronological history of this site. You will learn how this
      site came from a small collection of fan fiction in a subsection of my page
      to become the biggest collection of Tenchi FanFics on the net!</p></td>

<big><big>A Fledgling Archive (Version 1.0)</big></big>
<p>
This archive was born on March 8, 1997 as a sub-section to my
<a href="_/http/members.aol.com/gensao/index.html" target="_top">Tenchi Muyo Page on
AOL</a>.  There wasn't much fics out there at the time so the collection
was a meager dozen fics. currently all the fan fics were ZIPped up to save
space (Version 1.0).  I only had 2 MB of web space.
<p>
<i>The Organization Format at the time was:</i>
<blockquote>
<tt> index.html --&gt; fanfic.html --&gt; im-ryoko.zip</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
I have found that people had tons of problems with the compression of fan
fics, thus I used simple TXT format when my site was relocated to a server
with more space.
<p>
<big><big>The GeoCities Page (Version 1.1)</big></big>
<p>
On August 29, 1997, I moved my
<a href="_/http/www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Temple/9467/index.html" target="_top">main
page</a> to GeoCities, which still exists there today.  There, I decided
to stick with simple TXT format (Version 1.1).  Slowly my page began
to grow in content and the number of fics that it held.  
<p>
<i>The Organization Format at the time was:</i>
<blockquote>
<tt> index.html --&gt; fanfic.html --&gt; im-ryoko.txt</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
But over time the archive slowly grew larger, and larger. And by the
new year, I found it rather difficult to navigate.  Thus, I had to partition
the archive and change the way it was sorted.  First the lemons were
separated from the main archive (Version 1.2), then the Crossovers (Version
1.3), and finally the Misc. section was added (Version 1.4). This was implemented
gradually in the Winter of 1998.
<p>
<i>The Organization Format at the time was:</i>
<blockquote>
<tt> index.html --&gt; fanfic.html --&gt; reg.html --&gt; im-ryoko.txt</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
As time progressed, the archive yet again became to grow as a faster rate.
more and more fan fics seemed to flow in the Winter/Early Spring of 1998.
In this time frame the Voting Booth was implemented on March 14, 1998.
A counter was also added.
<p>
I then was faced with some startling facts. I was getting a lot more hits
on my fan fic page than my main page.  I was getting dangerously close
to the file capacity of my server. And again, the Fan Fic archives were getting
unruly Thus, I decided while on spring break to reformat my page and
make it an independent site.
<p>
<big><big>An Independent Page (Version 2.0)</big></big>
<p>
It took a lot of work, but I moved my fan fic archive to fujiko.simplenet.com
on April 4, 1998.  This new site was a greatly improved version (Version
2.0) of my site. I sorted my archive so that all fic with multiple
chapters will now have their own sub index. Originally I listed every multi-part
fic on the main indexes, but this proved to unnecessarily lengthened the
main indexes. After that I decided to time stamp all updated fics and keep
track of when I updated my page.
<p>
<i>The Organization Format at the time was:</i>
<blockquote>
<tt> index.html --&gt; fanfic.html --&gt; reg.html --&gt; r-im.html --&gt;
  im-ryoko.txt</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
With the new page came a lot of features an independent site needed.  A
frames version and a frames with Java version was added.  A counter
was added and a midi Jukebox was added to this new Version 2.0.  A banner
came later. Also teh Use of Mihoshi and Kiyone as a background image.
<p>
<img align="Right" alt="Aeka and Ryo-ohki" height="181" src="pic/v05-p025-aeka_ryo-ohki.gif" width="250"/><big><big>Mirror Mirror... and a Switch-a-Roo</big></big>
<p>
As time progressed I moved to kawaii.simplenet.com since the owner of
fujiko.simplenet.com wanted to change her server name. I would like to thank
her for allowing me to use her account. After that, I decided to make a
<a href="_/http/users.animanga.com/tenchi/index.html" target="_top">mirror</a> of my
page available at Animanga.com in May 24, 1998.  It is an exact mirror
of my main page with a minor changes that makes sure you are using a mirror.
<p>
Luckily I did because a few days later, Simplenet threatened to charge $200
a month for service. Kawaii.simplenet.com was defined as a "high resource
user". Thus I had to move my site once again. You can't have everything you
wanted...  Now it resides at its
<a href="_/http/members.xoom.com/gensao/index.html" target="_top">current location</a>
at Xoom.com as of June 8, 1998.
<p>
<big><big>Version 3.0</big></big>
<p>
Now it is summer, and I finally have the time to do a revision in format
and organization of this site.  Thus this update to version 3.0. 
I revised the general format of the page, changed graphics, added a few more
sub sections and other things.  There is a navigation index to some
of the pages. I hope the Yellowish color scheme looks great.
<p>
I have added the following lists of features for Version 3.0:
<ul>
<li>
    A complete reformat on the style of the page.  You may notice the increased
    use of tables and the use of the theme color, yellow.
  <li>
    Several of the old images have been replaced with new ones.
  <li>
    A new/revised <a href="banner.html">banner program</a>, now with a selection
    of banners to chose from
  <li>
    A <a href="history.html">brief history</a> of this site.
  <li>
    A <a href="intro.html">Intro fic</a> celebrating the release of Version 3.0
    of this site.
  <li>
    Navigation Indexes added for the <a href="reg.html">Regular</a> and
    <a href="misc.html">Misc</a> Sections.
  <li>
    Resolution tested at (640 X 480), (800 X 600), (1024 X 768), and higher.
     "Frames version" is not recommended in the (640 X 480) resolution.
  <li>
    Tested to work with Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer
  <li>
    Strictly follows HTML 3.2 Guidelines.
</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>
I felt like keeping Mio &amp; Kio as Un-official spokes people for this page.
 Thus their continued use in the background and the banners.
 Also in their role in the <a href="intro.html">short intro. fic.</a>
<p>
<big><big>Version 3.1</big></big>
<p>
Yes 3.1 heh heh, I did some formatting changes for web page.  I have
spent countless hours reviseing the format of this page a bit. As usual I
have added more fan fics.  Enjoy!
<p>
Version 3.1 includes the following changes.
<ul>
<li>
    A general reformat on how stories are arranged. (95% of the pages were
    reformatted to allow this change)
  <li>
    The Main Menu has been rearranged.
  <li>
    An <a href="award.html">awards</a> page was made.
  <li>
    A <a href="ref-how_to_write.html">How to Write a FanFic</a> page has been
    added in order to help aspiring writers.
  <li>
    A new banners in the <a href="banner.html">banner</a> page.
  <li>
    Addition of a <a href="c-frame.html">Java Applet</a> that will allow you
    to chat in my chat room-- <a href="chat.html">#TenchiFF</a>.
  <li>
    And general editing of the various pages.

<big><big>Version 4.0 "The New Domain"</big></big>
<p>
On September 1st, 1999, the archive finally moved to it's new home at tmffa.com.
 Not all features that I had wanted were implemented but many changes
were implemented.  The following page summarizes the changes:
<a href="h-domain.html">"A New Domain"</a>
<p>
<big><big>Christmas and Y2K</big></big>
<p>
<img align="Right" alt="Rear Logo!" height="338" src="pic/entry03.jpg" width="400"/>The
holidays were celebrated at the archive.  This was the fist time I had
ever decided to do a temporary theme change.  An example of the change
is the following three files. <a href="h-c-index.html">Title Page</a>,
<a href="h-c-intro.html">Intro Page</a> and <a href="h-c-fanfic.html">Main
Menu</a>.  Prehaps I will do more in the future. I woud like to thank
Bobert and Seion for thir work.
<p>
<big><big>TMFFA T-Shirt</big></big>
<p>
Durring the summer of 2001, I decided to make a T-shirt for the TMFFA.  It
was the first time that I actually had some mercandise for the archive.
<p>
There was a design contest where Jeff Rayder's Design came on top!  His
winning design is the image to the right. Michael McAvoy was second. I decided
to use his design for the front logo of the shirt.
<p>
More information of the <a href="t-shirt.html">TMFFA T-shirt</a> contest,
design, and results can be viewed at the <a href="t-shirt.html">following
page</a>.
<p>
<big><big>An Uncertain Future</big></big>
<p>
The future is one big mystery, but I will continue to archive the fics in
a timely manner, less real life gets me first. ^__- I am still
considering other changes and revisions to this archive. When time permits,
I will implement any changes. Until then, Ja for now...
