Hello,
<p>
This is a restatement of a message to that I had sent to the RFFC (Ryoko
Forever Fan Club) Mailing List and other mailing lists winter 1998. Perhaps
you will partake in this challenge also...
<p>
Aeka happens to be my favorite Tenchi character... I do also have a rather
high regard towards Ryoko, (She is my second favorite Tenchi character) Aeka
is numero uno, but barely. Several internet friends have suggested that I
start a AFFC (Aeka Forever Fan Club) being that there isn't any organization
that praises Aeka. Fortunately / unfortunately (Whatever you think), I do
not have the time to start up such a club. I am studying to be a civil engineer
and I archive / read Tenchi Fan Fics (That doesn't give me much time for
anything else).  Afterwards the AFC (Aeka Fan Club) came into existence
a short time after this letter, which I am one of the club's inital members.
<p>
Now you may wonder why Aeka is my favorite character... Well several months
ago I was rather undecided on who was my favorite Tenchi character, Aeka
or Ryoko. They both had their strong points and their weak points. (I could
go on and on about this topic but I won't) So I was as indecisive as Tenchi
was... But, I changed my mind thanks to one type of Tenchi material-- Fan
Fics...
<p>
<img align="Right" alt="Tenchi and Aeka" height="260" src="pic/v02-p115-tenchi_aeka.gif" width="250"/>Yep... That is right. FanFics have persuaded me into
placing Aeka on a high pedestal. I have read a lot of Tenchi fan fiction
(I kind of have to since I archive nearly every Tenchi Fic in existence...
ok not everyone... but a majority of them). And I have noticed a TON of Ryoko
gets Tenchi Fics. A few examples are "Ryoko's Love", "The Darkness", "No
need for Sasami", "Ryoko's Gems", "The Ball", "Ryouko's Loss", "It's the
Small Things that Matter", "Memories to the Present", "To B or Not to B",
and "Aikan Muyo" to a certain extent. But some of those stories warp Aeka's
character badly and unfairly boosts Ryoko's character. Thus Tenchi, has no
other choose but to choose Tenchi.  Although I do love the stories that
are in character, it is rather sad to note Aeka gets the short end of the
stick. Although there are a few fics where Aeka does get Tenchi. They are
mainly joint fics that has Tenchi marring both Aeka and another Tenchi character,
be it Sasami, Washu, Ryoko, etc.
<p>
I have yet to read any fic that would truly allow Aeka to win Tenchi's heart
all by herself. It made me feel sympathy towards Aeka. Everyone keeps bashing
her. Censoring her name, calling her names, making fun of eery weak point
she has. etc. That also may have been a contributing factor in my decision.
<p>
Not that many people care for Aeka once Ryoko gets Tenchi. Especially some
people that may read this, but you are free to your opinion. "Wasuremono",
by Ed Sharpe, was a somewhat believable tale on how Aeka would react if she
didn't get Tenchi. Also some writers have Aeka falling for another man. Perhaps
so that Ryoko can have Tenchi all to her self or that They wanted Aeka to
have some one else after Tenchi chooses Ryoko.
<p>
Just to see what would happen I decided to try a little experiment... A few
days ago, I participated in a RPG on the dal.net. Ryoko had won Tenchi's
heart once again... They asked me to play Aeka, so I decided to play the
part. Aeka took the news rather well and ran off crying... Many of the
participants didn't really care what happened to Aeka.  Ryoko finally
was suspicious and was looking around for the missing princess. She found
Sasami crying in the kitchen. Ryoko then learned from the grief stricken
princess that Aeka had taken her life. Obviously, everyone stated to care
again for Aeka. They tried their best to revive/heal her, but an omnipotent
power stopped them... Perhaps I was in a morbid mood at the time, but several
people Just want to see Tenchi with Ryoko. They don't care or ignore the
consequences of said act. So I showed then the error of their ways.
<p>
And finally my challenge... Since this tread is mainly titled "If Aeka got
Tenchi", then I challenge anyone to write a fan fic where Aeka gets Tenchi.
It must be believable and not be part of a paring or group wedding. I have
yet seen ANY fic where Aeka alone marries Tenchi. (That is saying a lot,
since I have read hundreds of Tenchi Fics.) It would be a nice change of
pace. Although it would be hard to write, you could explain and extrapolate
on how Ryoko handles loss. What would happen if Aeka did win? What wound
happen to Ryoko? What would happen to the others? One can explain their theory
though the ever so useful media of FanFics.
<p>
Thank you for your time and attention.
