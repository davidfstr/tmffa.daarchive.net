EPILOGUE

<NOTE: This is just a quick wrap-up, nothing long.

 Takero finished sweeping the living room as her two younger
children ran in, excitedly.
 "Shiasta's home!" They cried out, happily. "Shiasta's home!"
 Takero went outside.
 Shiasta was there with Miaku. She was smiling, radiantly,
though she looked a bit tired.
 Takero bent to embrace her daughter, then saw the sleeping
face of the infant in her arms.
 "Oh, Shiasta." Takero whispered, proudly.
 "Its a girl." Shiasta whispered, back. "Would you like to hold
her?"
 Takero nodded and took the baby girl into her arms,
 "She's beautiful." Takero told her. She looked up at Miaku. "You
both did a wonderful job."
 "Thanks, mom." Miaku beamed, with the kind of pride that only
a new dad can muster. "Her name is Ichiko."
 "Such a pretty name." Takero doted, fussing over the baby.
 Ichiko gurgled happily, as she woke her pretty grey eyes looking
up at the face of her grandmother for the first time. Her birth had, of
course, been very easy. Draalthi are extremely tiny when born and their
delivery takes all of ten minutes from the onset of labor. Now, at the
age of two months.she weighed just slightly less than a human baby of
that age would weigh. Her eyes blinked, then she started to cry.
 "I think she's hungry." Shiasta said, reaching up for the baby.
 Takero handed the baby to Shiasta, who opened her shirt just enough so
that the baby could drink from her.
 Little Ichiko's whimpers subsided as her tiny mouth clamped down
around her mother's nipple and she tasted the warm milk on her little
tongue. She drank deeply, until she'd had her fill, then turned her head
and drifted off to sleep.
