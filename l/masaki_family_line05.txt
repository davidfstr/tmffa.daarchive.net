	Tenchi stood by the side of Ryoko and
their new child.  "I think I have an idea on
what we should name her," said Tenchi.  Ryoko
looked up at him.  "And what's that?"
	"I think we should name her Achika,
after my mom," he stated.
	"Sounds like a good idea.  I like it.
Let's stick with it."
	Tenchi smiled and looked at his new
daughter.  He thought of everything that had
contributed to her creation, and all the 
changes that would have to be made.  "Hello,
Achika," he whispered.  He smiled at his
sleeping daughter.  
	Aeka walked in, after Washu had said
that she was allowed to do so.  She smiled
warmly at Tenchi, and Ryoko, and then walked
over to see the child, her step daughter.
She smiled at the little bundle of joy,
seeing it sleep there, in Ryoko's arms.  For
some reason, that image just didn't fit in
her mind.  But here it was.
	Ryoko didn't say anything, but just 
smiled.  Achika awoke, and cried a little.
Tenchi put his finger in the child's palm,
and she squeezed tightly, cooing.  Little
Achika didn't have very much hair yet, but
it was easy to see the cyan hairs 
nonetheless.  Achika had brown eyes, like
Tenchi.  
	Washu came in to see her new
granddaughter.  Washu beamed at the little
child.  "Aww..  Isn't she cute?  So, did
we decide on a name yet?" she questioned.
"Well, yeah, actually.  We're calling
her Achika, after my mom," he replied.
Aeka smiled.  Even though her gestation
period wasn't as short as Ryoko's, it
was still short by earth standards.  To
think that they actually had to wait nine
months!
	After a day of bed rest, Ryoko
and Little Achika were allowed to leave
the lab's newly-added maternity ward.
Tenchi had something to say, though. 
"Ryoko?  I had been meaning to do this
as a gift, but I just couldn't wait
any longer."  He took out Tenchi-ken,
and aimed the hilt at her.  He prayed,
and the last two gems appeared on Ryoko's
wrist and neck.  
	Ryoko looked at the gems.  "You 
really didn't have to, Tenchi," she 
said.  "That's not my sole drive in
life anymore."  "I know, but I thought
it would be the least I could do for
you."
	"But you've already done much
more."  
	Tenchi couldn't think of 
anything to say.  He didn't trust 
himself, he thought that his voice
would crack, and he'd start crying
with joy.
	Ryoko seemed to notice this,
so she put her arm around him.  He 
did start to cry, but not much.  His
tears soaked into Ryoko's hospital
gown, standard Washu issue.  
	Aeka hugged him, and for
the first time, Tenchi noticed her
standing there.  He could see that
even after only one week and a couple
of days, she was starting to show a
little.  Her stomach was pushing 
out slightly.  He patted her stomach,
and she blushed.  Tenchi's tears
had stopped.  
	Ryoko handed him Little 
Achika, and she phased into her
standard striped outfit, with the
tail.  Tenchi looked at her with
love.  Nobuyuki came down the 
stairs.  "Oh!  My granddaughter!
May I see her, Tenchi?" he said
trying to contain his excitement.
"What did you name her?" he 
questioned.
	"...Achika." he said.
	Nobuyuki was overflowed
with emotion, looking at his new
granddaughter.  "Achika..." he 
said, in a trance.  The child
cooed and reached up towards
him.  He smiled, with tears
at the corners of his eyes.  Gently,
he handed Little Achika back to
his son.  "Take good care of her,
Tenchi.  Nobuyuki then left for
work.  He'd have to catch up, since
he'd been absent for the entire week
after they found out that Ryoko was
pregnant.
	They didn't have any milk on hand,
so Ryoko would have to breastfeed.  She 
wasn't entirely partial to that at first,
until Mihoshi volunteered, at which she
quickly consented.  So they left Ryoko
alone to do that.  Tenchi and Aeka went
for a walk in the forest.  They got to
Funaho, and stopped there for a moment.
	"So, was Washu able to tell what
gender the baby would be?" asked Tenchi.
	"She took an amniotic sample, or
so she says, and was able to determine
that the child will be a boy." Aeka
replied proudly.	
	"Well, we should try and think
of a name.  I'm not really that good
at this sort of thing."
	"But you named your daughter 
Achika," stated Aeka.
	"Well..." said Tenchi, unable
to convey his feelings on that any 
further.
	"Very well.  I shall ponder
on this, Tenchi," she replied softly.
	"Thanks," said Tenchi, not even
trying to hid the relief in his voice.
	They shared a kiss, deep and
passionate.  Tenchi hugged her softly,
not wanting to cause any discomfort.
	Funaho replied with a few beams
of light.  "Oh!  That's right, I forgot!"
	"Forgot what?" questioned Tenchi.
	Aeka held out her hands to 
Funaho, and a seed dropped into them.
	"What's that?" 
	"For every newborn in the Juraian
Royalty, a tree is given.  It is supplied
by either Tsunami, or by a first-generation
tree, in this case, Funaho.  This seed is
for Achika."
	"But..Achika's not Royalty..."
	"Of course she is.  Remember, you
are going to be married to me, and that
makes your other wife Royalty, too, as 
well as any offspring that may come into
play, also," explained Aeka.
	"Oh!  So, what's that tree's 
name?" 
	"Achika is to give the tree a name,
when she is able to."
	"Well, you should take a seed out
for your child."
	"I am not allowed to do so until
the child is born.  Besides, the tree can
only bear one Royal Tree per every two
months.  This will be a second-generation
tree, and any born from it a third, and
so on.  The power diminishes with each
generation, though."
	"Where will we get a capsule for
it to grow in, so that it may become a
spaceship?"
	"I'm sure Washu-chan will be 
able to produce one by some means or 
another."
	After retrieving the seed, they
went back to the house.  "Oh, and Tenchi,
tomorrow is Sasami's birthday," she said
with utmost confidentiality.  Tenchi 
facefaulted.  "Couldn't you have told me
earlier?  How old will she be?" he 
questioned.
	"By earth standards, she will be
seven hundred and eighteen.  By Juraian
standards, she will be about sixteen,
but it is difficult to say.  I know she
looks even younger than sixteen to you,
but it is difficult."
	"She doesn't exactly look seven
hundred either, does she?"
	Aeka chucked.  "No, not really.
She is still young by Juraiain standards,
but by now she would begin her marital 
training, and the family would begin
to pursue a bridegroom for her."
	"What should we get her?" 
questioned Tenchi.
	"I already know what to get her.
It's something she's been wanting for so
long, and is now only able to have.  It
requires some of Funaho's wood.  You see,
she has always wanted my tiara, but I
couldn't allow her that, because it is
my key to Ryu-oh.  It must be made of 
Funaho, and also must be made with
Tsunami's consent, because she must put
some of her energy into it.  This makes
it a key to Tsunami."
	"Hmm..  I understand," said 
Tenchi, obviously not understanding at
all.  Ryoko was sitting on the couch,
rocking little Achika in her arms.  She
noticed them, and beamed at Tenchi.  He
thought that she looked more radiant then
than she had ever.  He kissed her, and
then looked at his child.  "May I hold
her?" he said softly.  She nodded, and
he took Achika into the kitchen
	Sasami looked up from preparing
lunch.  "Oh, you brought the baby!  Did
you name her yet?"
	"Yes, I named her Achika, after
my mom."
	"Ohh!  May I hold her, please?"
	"Of course, Sasami-chan.  That's
why I came in here, as a matter of fact."
	Sasami cradled the child, looking
into her eyes with love.  Little Achika
wasn't very active yet, but you could 
tell by the way she cooed that she would
be a little ball of energy.
	Tenchi smiled at the image of
Sasami holding Achika.  It looked so..
fitting.  He hugged Sasami around the
shoulders, trying not to accidentally
bump her arm.  Sasami blushed, in spite
of herself.  "Well, we better get out
of your way.  It looks as if you've got
a rather extensive lunch prepared."
	Sasami smiled, and said, "Yup!"
	So Tenchi took Achika, and he
and Aeka left the kitchen.  Ryoko 
stood up slowly.  Tenchi then noticed
that some change had gone on; Ryoko now
sported a flowery pattern on her skin,
and the centers of the flowers were
where each of the three gems were.
	"Woah, Ryoko, what's that?"
	"I don't know.  About three
hours after you gave me the gems, these
patterns appeared."
	"Well, I must say, it really
accents you."
	"Thank you."
	They kissed, and Ryoko was no
longer her subdued self; she groped
him and frenched him.  Tenchi almost
hadn't noticed when she had been all
quiet after the birth of their daughter.
	"Well, I think it's time for
Achika's nap," she said in a sultry
voice.
	It took Tenchi a minute to 
catch on.  "Oh," he said.  "Sure, I 
think she needs a nap," he said, 
throwing a wink at Ryoko.  Aeka 
sighed.  Ryoko giggled.  Tenchi 
sweatdropped.  Katsuhito walked
in the door.  "Well, hello.  And
am I able to see my great-granddaughter
now?" he questioned.
	"Of course, grandpa."
	"And have you decided what to
name her yet?"
	"Yes.  We named her Achika."
	Katsuhito nodded knowingly.
"Ah, I see.  Good choice of naming,
if I do say so myself."
	He cradled the child for a 
while, looking in her eyes as if
trying to see something that wasn't
there.  For some reason, Achika grew
strangely silent while he was looking
at her in this manner.  Tenchi looked
at him questioningly, but Katsuhito
had nothing to say.  He simply smiled
and handed Achika back to Tenchi.
	"That's some daughter you have
there.  Just be sure not to spoil her,
like we did to you," he joked.
	"Grandpa..."

I know, I know, I haven't exactly been 
writing lemon chapters lately, but for some
reason, I find these types of stories more
interesting.  Also, I can say that Masaki 6 
will hold a surprise for everyone.

And I'd like to thank Dustin for providing
the name for Tenchi's child.
