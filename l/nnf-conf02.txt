*****************************************************************************
The next morning after, Tenchi's and Aeka's wild night, Tenchi woke up with 
his alarm ringing at 7:00 A.M.

"Oh shit I forgot to set the alarm to 6:30, goddamnit I'm going to be late 
for school!" Tenchi thought aloud. 

He got dressed in a matter of seconds and stormed out the room down the 
kitchen. Everyone was asleep and Sasami did not wake up until 9:00. Tenchi 
made some noodles and ate it as fast as he can. Meanwhile, Aeka was feeling 
cold knowing Tenchi was not next to her. 

"*Yawn*. Hmm where is Tenchi?" Aeka asked herself, still naked from the wild 
night she and Tenchi had. "I better get dress before anyone sees me here."

After eating Tenchi ran out the house. Running in great haste he was able to 
catch the bus.

* Back in the house *

Everyone has just woken up from sleeping, except for Ryoko of course, and met 
at the kitchen table which Sasami has already made breakfast. Aeka came down 
in a very contented mood. 

"Gee sis why are you so happy?" Sasami wondered.
"Oh it's nothing. It must have been what I had last night." Aeka giggled.
"Wow you really did like my fish I cooked last night," Sasami thought.

After eating, Ryoko has just woken up and started to pester Aeka as usual. 
Aeka didn't really mind and just walked past her. 

"Hmm, why is Aeka ignoring and not saying anything back to me?" Ryoko said 
all puzzled. 
"Oh don't worry Ryoko I'm in a wonderful mood today. Anything you say or do 
to me wont even bother me," Aeka smiled and walked outside to get some fresh 
aim.

* Later that afternoon *
"Damn I'm soo tired, but coming home makes it all better."
"Hi Tenchi! Wana go on a hike with me?" Aeka asked, sitting outside looking 
out on the lake.
"Sure, I guess it could relieve some of the stress I had today at school," 
Tenchi replied. 
While walking down the Forrest trail, Aeka starts to wonder:
" I wonder if Tenchi really loves me? If what we did last night showed our 
true affection why isn't he saying anything romantic to bring up the mood?"

During that, Tenchi also has the same thoughts. He tries to bring up a 
conversation.

"Um Aeka so how was it in..." his sentence was then caught off when he fell 
into a hole which was 10ft deep and 7ft wide. (just trying to give a good 
description) 

"Tenchi are you ok?!" Aeka asked in shock. 
"Awww," Tenchi moaned in pain, " I think I broke my foot and my leg." 
"Here ill help you out," Aeka tore a piece from here kimono dress and made a 
line from her dress, and dropping it down to Tenchi. " See if you can tie 
yourself and ill pull you out." 

It started to work out successfully but then Tenchi's weight ripped her dress 
and she fell into the hole.

"Oh no Aeka ill catch you!" Tenchi moved and caught the naked Aeka in his 
arms. "Ah, got ya. It's a good..." he was halted from looking up at Aeka's 
body. Although Tenchi had sex with Aeka the other night he did not really see 
her exposed body since it was dark. Now he finally gazed at her perfectly 
round tits. Her body as white and smooth as milk. Her vagina was clean shaven 
and had a nice round ass. More like a perfect body. Aeka woke up from her 
faint and noticed she was naked.

"Huh? Oh no I must have fallen, I'm sorry Tenchi." Aeka apologized not caring 
that she was nude. 

Tenchi backed up trying to cover his eyes with his fingers but left a huge 
ass gap. Aeka then noticed that he had a bulge in his pants. Tenchi tried 
moving back by crawling but was not fast enough. Aeka already turned on goes 
closer to him.

" Come here Tenchi ill make sure your all better.' Aeka offered. Tenchi was 
out of breath and gave up. He coudnt really say anything. Aeka took one of 
the shrouds of the kimono and used it to wrap his leg and feet. " All 
better." 

" Thanks Aeka" Tenchi then hugged her and he started to feel great warmth. He 
then gazed in her eyes and started to kiss her. He broke it off and looked at 
her again. "Aeka, thank you again. You don't know how much I want to be 
closer to you." Aeka smiles and cries. She grabs Tenchi and hugs him, then 
started to put her tongue in his mouth. Both wrapped their tongues together 
and in circular motion. Tenchi pushes further and further down near her 
wisdom teeth. Aeka then started to massage the bulge in his pants and started 
to caress it. Tenchi then put this hand on her left tit and started doing to 
the same. All of a sudden they hear a voice.

"I think they fell in my rabbit trap Sasami," Mihoshi said heading toward the 
hole which they fell in. Both Tenchi and Aeka broke the kiss and Aeka tried 
to gather her torn clothes and tried to cover herself. Tenchi started to back 
off to the other end. 

"If they see us together like this who knows what will happen," Tenchi 
exclaimed. Then Ryoko phased on top of the hole.
"Here they are," Ryoko alerted. "Are you alright my dear Tenchi?' Ryoko grabs 
him and both phase back onto the ground. 

"Hey Ryoko what about me!" Aeka shouted in anger.
"Why don't you stay there for the night instead princess," Ryoko stuck her 
tongue out. Sasami and Mihoshi finally came and got Aeka out.

"Gee Mihoshi that was a pretty big trap for a rabbit,"Tenchi laughed.
"Yeah I was hoping to catch a family," said Mihoshi in a idiotic look. 
"Cmon guys lets go home I got dinner ready." Said Sasani.
"Ill fly you there tenchi,"Ryoko offered carrying Tenchi already.
"If you don't mind Ryoko I would like to walk instead," Ryoko putting Tenchi 
on the ground. Sasami and Mihoshi jumped onto Ryoko's arm and both cheered to 
take her home. Ryoko phased back to the house.

"Cmon Tenchi ill help you up." Aeka grabbed Tenchi and both started walking.
"Thanks Aeka. I rather walk with you. I want to be together forever." Tenchi 
said while gazing at Aeka at the sunset.
Aeka and Tenchi look at each other and finally finished the kiss they had.
