TM! One Morning In The Masaki Home...
(Lemon?)
------------------------------------

Ryoko felt the hardness between her legs even more acutely now.
She pumped and pumped, faster and faster, harder and harder. Her
legs ache, their muscles straining. Her breath was coming in
quick pants now. And still, she kept on. Pumping and pumping.
Her body moved up and down slight, with the motion of her legs,
her breasts bouncing just a little. She felt a sense of
exhilaration and pumped faster still. Her body strained more,
but it felt good all the same. She revelled in the feeling,
enjoying its every nuance, until she heard a cry of outrage from
the door.

"Ryoko, hurry up!" Ayeka demanded. "Other people would like to
use the exercise bike, too!"
