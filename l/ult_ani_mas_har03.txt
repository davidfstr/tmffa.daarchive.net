Setting: Tenchi's Cruiser

Tenchi: "We escaped."
Usagi: "I thought we were gone for good."
Mamoru: "Though it will be difficult, we must make Keel pay for what he did."
Rei: "That's right!"
Makato: "We're going to make him sorry that he ever messed with us!"
Usagi: "I'm not sure, those N2 EVAs are far too powerful."
Tenchi: "WE can't do anything, but that Trev fellow can."
Ami: "Of course..."

At the Mansion in Racoon City...

Claire: "I wonder how Leon managed to form that ki ball."
Ada: "I would like to know as well."
Jill: "Maybe he has some AAA grade steroids."
Sherry: "He has a training chamber."
Jill, Ada, Jill: "What?"
Sherry: "It's hidden in the basement."

The sound of glass shattering occurs...

Claire: "Sounds like a break in."
Jill: "We had better lock and load."

Claire gets her dual Uzis, Jill gets her Remington M1100 semi automatic shotgun, 
Sherry gets her Desert Eagle .357 magnum pistol, while Ada gets the left overs, 
which is dual Glock 17s.

Claire: "Let's go kill us some zombies!"
Sherry and Jill: "Yee-haw!"
Ada: * Stupid rednecks... *

Down in the dining room...

Shery: "Twenty bucks says I can kill three zombies within five seconds, blind 
folded!"
Claire: "You're on!"
Sherry: "Here we go!"

Sherry puts on the blind fold and BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Jill: "I bet you cheated!"
Sherry: "Hell no, that was pure skill!"
Jill: "I bet fifty bucks I can decapitate four zombies with one shotgun blast at 
point blank range."
Claire: "I'll bet on that."
Sherry: "Me too!"

Jill then charges up to four zombies and Kersplat! Four heads go rolling...

Claire: "It had to be a fluke!"
Jill: "Ha!"

Meanwhile at the Umbrella plant...

Chris: "Leon, care to break down the door?"
Leon: "Endokuken!"

Leon uses the mighty Endokuken blast from Killer Instinct to break down the door 
to the Umbrella facility...

"ROAR!"
Carlos: "I know that growl all to well..."
Nemesis: "Wesker has been expecting you."
Chris: "Fire!"

Chris, Carlos, and Steve fire away, but don't even leave a dent in the 
monstrousity known as the Nemesis Tyrant...

Nemesis: "ROAR!"
Chris: "Leon, can't you use your ki to stop him?"
Leon: "I'd though you'd never ask."
Nemesis: "Die!"
Leon: "Feel the ki of the Earth, bitch! Hurricane Fist!"

SPLAT! Nemesis is grinded up like an axe, chunks of the monsters organs rain in 
a 50 feet radius...

Steve: "That's just grosse."

In Tokyo...

Tetsuo: "De Spell!"
Death Metal: "What the fuck?"

Death Metal slits back into three people...

Adrian Cronin: "Not good at all."
Trev: "This is bullshit!"
Tetsuo: "Raging Blast of Hell!"

Tetsuo fires a might ki blast at Adrian with such force it mutilates him...

Trev: "....................................." (speechless)
Trell: "Damn it!"
Tetsuo: "Raging Blast of Hell!"

Now Trell gets mutilated...

Trev: "God, how could you let that happen!? They didn't deserve to die!"
Tetsuo: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha, God is powerless to stop me!"
Trev (Now in a trance): "KILL..."
Tetsuo: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
Trev: "KILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tetsuo: "Kill what?"
Trev: "KILL YOU!"
Tetsuo: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Man, don't make me laugh like that!"
Trev: "Kaioken x20!"

Trev uses Kaioken x20 and quickly slices Tetsuo in half with the Razor of 
Life...

Tetsuo: "SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

SPLAT!

Trev: "Kill... kill... kill..."

Trev in his pyschotic trance unleashes his ki which creates a hurricane over the 
city of Tokyo...

Trev: "KILL THEM ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

After unleashing his ki, the lone survivors of Crystal Tokyo's destruction come 
in for a landing...

Usagi: "Trev?"
Ami: "Holy shit, it looks like he's in a Psychotic Murder Syndrome!"
Rei: "Psychotic Murder what?"
Makato: "It's when some loses something dear to him, and goes mad."
Tenchi: "Mad enough to destroy the universe."
Mamoru: "That's not good."
Trev: "KILL... KILL... KILL... KILL!"
Tenchi: "I wanna go back home to Jurai, I don't wanna face someone with the 
Psychotic Murder Syndrome!"
Trev: "Omega Kaioken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" (Made this one up, think of it 
as a Kaioken x100...)
Minako: "Uh oh, looks like we're about to get a thrashing..."

Trev then unleashes so much ki it KOs the scouts and Tenchi...

Trev: "You're too weak, you don't derverve to join the DARK SIDE of the Force!" 
(With our hero in a Psychotic Murder Trance, there's only one more hope for us!)

Raccon City... UMB Factory...

Leon: "Here's the control room..."
Chris: "Leon, you know the score." 
Leon: "Right... Haduken!"

BOOM! Leon's blast knocks down the armoured door to the control room

Carlos: "Good job yo!"
Steve: "Shit..."

After the snoke clears...

Alexia: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You are too late, for soon the Ultimate Being will 
be reborn!"
Chris: "Get rid of this annoying whench, will you?"
Leon: "Gladly... DRAGON UPPERCUT!"

Leon performs Kazuya's Dragon Uppercut, and literally decapitates the bitch...

Carlos: "I love you man!"
Steve: "That kicked ass!"

Tokyo... Trev jumps up 250 feet into the air and charges up mad ki...

Trev: "Now this planet will feel my wrath! Unnecesseraly Powerful Blast!" (It's 
Trev's new attack, the Unnecesseraly Powerful Blast!)
(sounds like it's coming from an intercom) "Hold it... You must compete with 
us."
Trev: "N2s and EVAs merged together? What a pile of crap."
Char Aznable: "Units 00-01, attack with your explosive shell shotguns in 8... 
7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... FIRE!"

They don't even lay a dent in Trev and the power of the Pychotic Murder 
Trance...

Char: "Bullshit!"
Ayanami Rei: "Is there a problem sir?"
Char: "Yeah..."
Shinji: "What would that be sir?"
Char: "We're gonna die!"
Asuka: "That is such a pity sir." (Remember, the children were zombified by 
SEELE, so they're virtually emotionless.)
Trev: "Let me show you the true power of the Psychotic Murder Syndrome!"

Trev turns into a raging 300+ ft. giant, now he can really stand toe to toe with 
the N2 EVAs!'

Char: "SHIT!"
Trev: "Kamehameha!"

Char's AT field and Trev's blast emit a massive shockwave on collision...
Asuak: "I will handle this."
Char: "No Asuka, he's far to powerful!"

Trev draws his now gigantic blade and stabs Asuka...

Asuka: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Shinji (coming out of his trance): "Asuka, no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" * Asuka, the 
one I truly love is going to die.* "DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!"

As Shinji goes Berzerk, we take you to Racoon City...

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!" 
Chris: "It can't be him, I thought he was dead!"
"You obviously didn't think right. I am back from the dead!"
Leon: "I'll feed you to the dead!"
Wesker: "You don't have a chance!"
Leon: "Haduken!"
Wesker: "Kaioken x20!"

Wesker absorbs Leon's blast as if it was water instead of ki...

Leon: "Damn, this guy rules ass. I guess it's time I show my true self."

In no time at all, Leon gets blonde hair and green eyes, Leon has reveiled 
himself as a Saiya-jin...

Wesker: "That's not going to help you any. Kamehameha!"

The Kamehameha hits Leon and send him flying back over 20 feet...

Leon: "Damn it, he's far too powerful!"
Wesker: "Genki Dama!"
Chris: "Everyone, let's get of of here!"

The Genki Dama leaves the UMB plant in ruins...

Leon: "How the hell did he do that!?"
Carlos: "Yo Leon, we gettin' outta here, you comin'?"
Leon: "I have to stop this maniac!"
Steve: "Insane dude!"
Chris: "Just make sure you whoop his ass, alrighty?"
Leon: "I'll try."

Chris, Carlos, ans Steve flea for their lives, but Leon is still there to battle 
Wesker on his own...

Wesker: "Well my un worthy adversary, what's your name?"
Leon: "Leon S. Kennedy!"
Wesker: "Well Leon, let's see what you an do!"
Leon: "You'll soon run in fear!"

Leon then bulks up so much it looks like he's been using to much steroids...

Leon: "Fear the Ultra Sauper Saiya-jin power, bitch! Haduken!"

Wesker evades with ease...

Leon: "No fucking way!"
Wesker: "Kaioken x20, Kamehameha!"

The blast knocks Leon back a good 34 feet...

Leon: "I can't get up..."
Wesker: "Pathetic. Kaoiken x20, Masenko-ha!"

Boom! Leon skids a whole 40 feet accross the ground...

Leon: "Too... Powerful..."
Wesker: "You have got nothing."

A beeping sound then comes from the ruble...

Wesker: "The Ultimate Being, he is alive once again!"

The ruble of the UMB plant explodes, and out pops the Ultimate Being...

UB: "You seek the Ultima Being, am I correct?"
Wesker: "Yes, I want you to help me achieve world domination!"
UB: "That won't be possible, because everyone except me with be destroyed!"
Wesker: "Son of a bitch...................."

Splat! In the blink of an eye, Wesker is decapitated...

Leon: * Oh hell no! *
UB: "What do we have here? A worthless Saiya-jin... Get up and fight you 
worthless creature!"
Leon: "How the Hell can I win?" * I must learn that Kaioken or whatever it's 
called that Wesker used... *
UB: "Hurry up and attack! I must feast on blood!"
Leon: * Here it goes. * "Kaioken x20!"

Leon out of nowhere punches the Ultimate Being on the left side of the face...

UB: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Leon: "Kamehameha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
UB: "Screw you! Unnecessaraly Powerful blast!"

They ignite a miniature nuclear explosion...

Leon: "Damn you! You were supposed to die!"
UB: "Fuck off! Gamet gun fire!"
Leon: "Haduken!"

A slightly bigger nuclear blast is ignited this time...

UB: "Fucking shit, I am the Ultimate Being, God damn it!"
Leon: "I've had enough fo your damned ego there buddy! Kaioken x20, Genki Dama!"
UB: "NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Another mini nuke blast goes off, but this is an explosion of blood and severed 
limbs...

Leon: "I had better get home..."

Then there is a shimering glow...

Leon: "What the fuck?"
"I am the eternal dragon, Shenron. What is it that you desire?"
Leon: "Let me think... * Let's see how wel this works... * "Who are my parents?"
Shenron: "Here are the images of our past...

Leon sees images of his father Bardock and his mother Misaki. He also sees a 
jealous Azusa who throws him into a Jarui ship and sends him away to Earth...

Leon: "Holy shit, this must be a dream!"

At the mansion...

Chris: "So that's that, Leon sacrifieced himself to save our asses."
Ada: "Damn it."
"I'm back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Claire: "Holy shit? Chris said you could have never beaten Wesker!"
Leon: "It only got worse from there on, but I'm not gonn tell nowm I'm too 
tired, and I need a shower."
Ada: "Mind if I join you?"
Carlos: "Yo Leon, you da man!"
Jill: "Don't pressure him Carlos."
Steve: "C 'mon Leon, you earned it."
Claire: "You guys..."
Sherry: "Have fun..."
Leon: "Shall we Ada?"
Ada: "Abso-fucking-lutely."

As the thsoe two are off... (They do have sex by the way, but in way it serves a 
bad purpose, but that'll be explained later.)

Chris: "In a way, this day was in-fucking-credible."
Carlos: "Damn man, you got that right man!"
Steve: "I bet you ladies had your handful with all the zombie break ins and 
all."
Claire: "Hell no, it was fun!"
All in unsion: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
