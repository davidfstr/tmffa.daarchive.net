                       The Semi-Normal Day For Tenchi

It was a semi normal day at the residence of the Maski's, well as normal as
it ever gets there.
"Ryoko! You bitch! How dare you do that to Lord Tenchi!" yelled the bitch
princess.
"Well at least i have the guts to!" Ryoko countered "Besides princess why
would you care? Did you want to give tenchi his first blow job?" Ryoko
laughed.
"Take this MONSTER!" Ayeka yelled andfires electricity from the logs that
are floating around her. Ryoko dodged and the bolt struck a hole in the wall
just above tenchis head.Ryoko fired a palm blast but ayeka disaapaated it
with her shield.
Tenchi was just droppy in a chair. HIs pants bagged, his shirt bagged, his
eyes bagged. He was just plain tired.
+Flash Back+
Tenchi was haveing a strange dream about water falls. The he starts the feel
wierd. He wakes up to find Ryoko just help her self to his cock.
"Ryoko! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!!!!" screamed Tenchi.
"OH Hi Tenchi!" Ryoko said cheerfully "Dont worry ill be done in a minute"
"AHHH! NO YOU DONE NOW!" Tenchi yeled as he placed is feet on her chest and
catapulter her through the wall. Straight into Aykeas room. It didnt take
the bitch princess long to  peices together to scene.
+End Flash back+
"2 straight hours" Nobiuki whistled. "Thats gotta be a record or something."
"Nah" Kyona answered, "The gotta go 5 hours to bet the record." as he popped
another peice of popcormn in her mouth.
"Wanna put a little wager on the fight?" Nobiuki asked the audinces.
"5 bucks on Akea" Sasami said!
"Your outta you mind, 5 bucks on Ryoko" Said Kyona.
"10 bucks says they fight for 6 hours then one of um blast the other
strqaight through the wall and we have to rush her to the hospital" said
Tenchi.
At first he was only kidding but come 4 hours later.
"I've had enough bitch princess!!" Ryoko says and cupped her hands bye her
side. "Final Beam Blast!" Ryoko yelled nad fired the attack at Ayeka. The
attack ripped straight through her shield and blasted half the housesside
off. Akeak lay in the ruin Battered, beatten, and unconious.
"Strick three SHE OUT!" Ryoko yelled. The rest of the crew stared at Tenchi
and Myoshi started to spill some hot coffee, That she was pouring for
tenchi, all over Tench's crotch.
"HOLY FUCK MYOSHI STOP! YOU BURNING MY DICK GOD DAMNIT!"
"Oh poor Tenchi!" said Ryoko phasing over to him. "Don't worry i clean you
up" She said and began to lick the coffee off his pants.
"Ryoko....stop." Tenchi said looking down in disbelieve
"Thats disturbing-" Said Kyona.
"GO TENCHI!" Nobiuki yelled
Ryoko started to work the zipper of his pants.
"Stop RYOKO!!" Tenchi yelled. But to late before Tenchi could pull away  She
unzipped his and his mighty cock sprung out and slammed Ryoko in her face.
"OH MY!" Sasami crie out.
"That has to be very-" Kyona started but she was interupted but Nobiuki
"YAY, TENCHI! GIVE IT TO HER!" Nobiuki yelled "I'm so proud"
"Ryoko, if you dont stop ill send you flying further then Ayeka." Tenchi
said annoyed
"But Tenchi I..." This was the first time Tenchi had ever threathened to
actually hurt Ryoko.
"NOW!" Tenchi yelled. Ryoko backed away and phased away. Tenchi stormed up
into his room. The rest of the gang went about with their business.
But in the living room through a certian hole a bitch said "Can some one
help me" then died.
+Later that day+
Nobiuki opened Tenchis bed room door. He saw him sitting on his bed.
"Hey Tenchi just wanted  to tell you that Sasami's making dinner, and huh oh
yea Ayeka died" Nobiuki said.
"Cool" Tenchi answered plainly.
+Later that week+
Tenchi was watching T.V. when he said "Hey, wheres Ayeka?"
"Didn't she die?" Kyona said glued to the show they where watching.
"Oh yea"
He looked over at the corner of the room. Ryoko was floating in mid-air
meditating. She had been really void of Tenchi lately. Anytime he would walk
close to her she would phase away.
She hadn't spoke to him since the living room incident.
"Is it just me or is it kinda breezy in here?" Myoshi said.
"Well we are kinda missing a wall now..." Tenchi said looking at Ryoko.
"Thanks Ryoko" But when Tenchi looked back at ryoko she looked at him with
sad eyes the phased away.
+Later that Day+
Tenchi was heading up the the attic, thats where ryoko sleeps, the see whats
wrong with her. when he opened up the door Ryoko looked up at him then
started to go through the floor.But tenchi caughter her hand and pulled her
back up.
"Now wait a minute, you have been acting weird all week and i want to know
why!" Tenchi said.
"Isnt this what you wanted me to do, leave you alone?" Ryoko asked
curiously.
"No well alittle but not like this, I want you to be my friend with out
always  being so sexual. You know, i dont want to go to bed at night
wondering if your gonna be attacked to my dick when I wake up. I want you to
give me some personal space!"
"I can help it! Its just tha- nevermind" She said
"That what?"
"Its..... uh ....I ...uh.I love you, and i want you to love me to!" She
said, as soon as she said it she regreted it. *That was so stupid*
"Well then ill have to give you what you want"Tenchi said.
"What?"
But Tenchi lean forward and gave her a little kiss on her cheek, The he
kissed her on her lips. his tongue shot into her mouth. His tongue explored
the inside of Ryokos mouth. Ryoko's tongue met his and they entwined.
Finnaly tenchi broke the kiss. He reached around and pulled off her shirt
revealuing her bra. Ryoko took off her bra and let it fall reavealing her
soft bouncing breast. Tenchi grabbed one and began to message it. Then he
pulled his shirt off and kissed Ryoko.
"I love you Ryoko."
