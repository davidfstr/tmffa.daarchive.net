"Ryoko Muyo!" Chapter 1-"No Need For Apologies"
Ryoko catches Tenchi in the act with Ayeka

Beep!Beep!Beep!Beep! Tenchi's digital alarm clock rang. "What the fu..."
Tenchi fell out of
bed. "Oh my gosh... Tenchi, are you alright?" Tenchi heard a voice
behind him. "Oh, I alright, it's just b
....AHHH!! Ryoko. Don't do that again!!" Ryoko giggled "Wake up sleepy
head" Ryoko said
cheerfully. "Ryoko, what are you up to this time?" "Tenchi" Ryoko purred
"why do you always accuse me
of things like that?" Tenchi said softy under his voice "Well, you are
the most wanted space
pirate in the Universe" Ryoko glared at him "I heard that!" Ryoko said
angrily as she vaporized
into the floor.

<In the Kitchen>

"Hey Sasami!" Greeted Tenchi. "Hi Tenchi!" replied Sasami. "Have you
seen Ryoko around lately?"
asked Tenchi. Sasami shook her head and continued to make breakfast. On
his way out of the Kitchen,
Tenchi bumped into Ayeka. "Oh! Lord Tenchi, I'm so sorry!" Ayeka
appologized. "It's alright Miss Ayeka."
Tenchi knew it wasn't smart to ask Ayeka if she had seen Ryoko, but he
really felt guilty for
misjudging Ryoko. But he asked anyway. "Why do you ever care about that
Demon Bitch!" Ayeka said angrilly.
"Ayeka, you shouldn't talk about Ryoko like that" Tenchi said nervously
"So have you seen her or not?"
"No" replied Ayeka.

<Later, after breakfast>

Tenchi still hadn't seen Ryoko. He was getting really worried since
Ryoko hadn't tried to seduce
him yet once today. He decided to check Ryoko's cave.

<Ryoko's Cave>

Tenchi heard echo's coming from the cave. "So this is where she's been
hiding" Tenchi said to himself. He enter the cave,
it was Ryoko's voice all right. But not what he was expecting."Dammit,
there's got to be
some way to get Tenchi" Tenchi now had a full view of Ryoko. Tenchi
wasn't sure if he should disturb her, so he just went back
to the house.

<Masaki Residence>

Tenchi decided to go up to his room and think for a while. On his way
up, he bumped into
Ayeka again. "Oh, hello Lord Tenchi. Where have you been?"  Asked the
curious princess. Tenchi
clumsily replied."I was looking for Ryo..er..." Tenchi decided he'd
better not say it for his own
health."Tenchi" Ayeka said in a low voice "what does Ryoko have that I
don't?" Tenchi gulped,
"Errr....um....no.nothing...I.I.I.guess." Tenchi replied nervously. "
Then Tenchi, if you don't
mind, I have a gift for you" Ayeka started to say seductivly. Ayeka put
her lips against his and started
kissing. They were like that for four minutes. "Wow Ayeka" Tenchi
started to reply. "Wait Tenchi
that's not all, come into my room."

<Ayeka's Room>

"So Aye...."Tenchi started to say, until Ayeka shut the lights off and
locked the door. Ayeka
pushed him down on the bed and handcuffed him. "Now Tenchi, you are
mine." Ayeka said in a deep,
seductive voice. Tenchi took a really big gulp. Ayeka started to take
off her clothes, revealing
her milky, white skin. Then she started to take his pants off revealing
his already hard erection.
She sat on Tenchi's face so her pussy was right in front of his face.
"Now Tenchi,you will
give me pleasure" Ayeka demanded. Unable to resist, Tenchi started to
massage her clit with his tounge. "MMMMmnn
nnnnnnnnnn!"Ayeka moaned loudly "Oh yes Tenchi! Just like that" Then ,
he went for it and stuck
his tounge in her swollen clit. Ayeka moaned louder than ever and
started humping Tenchi's head
Ayeka climaxed and cummed in Tenchi's mouth. Ayeka, very exausted,
collapsed. Tenchi found the
key's to to cuff and was free. Right before he left, he turned back to
Ayeka and kissed Ayeka on
the forehead. Tenchi walked out of the room to be confronted by Ryoko.
She had tears running
down her cheek. "Tenchi" Ryoko said softly. "I HATE YOU!" she yelled as
she stormed down the stair case.
Tenchi thought to himself. <Dammit, she'll never forgive me. I'm such a
fucking moron.
How could I make it  up to her?>

<That Night>

Tenchi lay in his bed. Worried more than ever what Ryoko might do. He
had screwed her over twice!
He figured she was still here because Ryo-ohki fell into his miso soup
an hour before. He was trying to
figure out how he could make it up to her.

<The Next Day>

Tenchi woke up at the sound of his alarm clock. He was suprised to not
see Ryoko lying next to him.
He decided to go talk to Washuu.

<Washuu's Lab>

Tenchi opened the door carefully trying to watch out for any tentacles
popping out of the walls.
"Little Washuu? Are you in here?"Tenchi asked nervously. Letting his
guard down, tentacles popped out of the
walls and grabbed Tenchi. Washuu appeared out of nowhere and held her
hands out. She started punching in commands in
lap-top. "Little Washuu?" Tenchi asked "Have you seen Ryoko?" Just that
moment,
Tenchi heard a big explosion, it was coming from the women's bath.
Tenchi, immediatly knew Ryoko
had started a fight with Ayeka. The tentacles relased him and Tenchi ran
to the bath.

<Women's Bath>

Tenchi stormed into the bath just in time to see Ryoko kick Ayeka into
the bath. She had her orange
energy sword ready. She lifted it and swung it down into the water where
Ayeka was pushed.
