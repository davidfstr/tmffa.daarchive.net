Hello all...This is my first fanfic, so please excuse my naiveté.

THIS IS A LEMON, SO ALL THOSE UNDER 18 LEAVE NOW!!!!!!

Tenchi Muyo is not owned by me, but by AIC and Pioneer.  Imitation is 
the sincerest form of flattery, so don't sue me.  I'm a grad student 
with no money.

Some comments: Ryoko is not completely in character here, she has quite 
a bit of Zero's shyness.  I've always assumed that even with her brash 
attitude and brazen ways, Ryoko is probably a virgin.  Tenchi is not 
quite in character either, not the usual indecisive, bloodied nose 
fellow we all know and love.  However, it has been my observation that 
men who are normally anything but macho in the real world, can be quite 
commanding and interesting in bed.  I got a feeling that Tenchi's one of 
those.

************************************************************************

	The stars looked cold from Earth.  Although Ryoko was impervious 
to the chill weather outside, she could sense it from the sky.  She 
sighed.  Lately, she had begun to realize just how strange her and 
Ayeka's behavior must seem to Tenchi.  She had begun to fall back on all 
the old techniques of observation from her long years in that cold, dark 
cave.  She shivered.  She didn't want to think about that.  She just 
wanted to live.  LIVE.  Experience everything.  Especially love.  But 
she knew that the ways she had approached Tenchi were wrong for him.  
She was calmer now, if just a little.  She wondered if things would ever 
change.
	She phased back through the roof into Tenchi's room.  She took up 
her favorite pastime, watching him.  She had been watching him so long.  
Longer than he would ever know.  She wished that she could feel his 
love, even for just a moment.  She gazed down at him, floating above 
him.  Was something wrong?  
	He was writhing on the bed.  Even though the room was cool he was 
sweating.  Ryoko was just going to wake him from his nightmare, when he 
moaned.  She looked down his body, and saw the cause of his worry.  His 
loose pants gave ample evidence of the pillar of his distress.  Ryoko 
smiled.  *What a tentpole.  Can't let that go to waste.*  No one and 
nothing in the universe can wear such a satisfied feline smile.  *Well, 
well, well.  Who are you dreaming of Tenchi?   Hmm....*
	*No, I can't.  It would just ruin it for him.  And for me.  I 
can't wake him up.  But I just want to feel him.  Somehow.*  She thought 
hard.  Her pointed teeth catching on her full bottom lip as she 
contemplated her options.  
	*That might work!  Well first things first.*  She flew to Tenchi's 
desk, and propped the chair underneath the doorknob.  *That should take 
care of Ayeka for the moment.  She's probably snoring her head off.  
What did that TV show say..sawing logs?  Oh that is perfect, just 
perfect!!  Anyway, back to Tenchi.*
	She sat ever so gently on the bed, hoping desperately not to 
disturb him.  She phased out of her clothes, loving the feel of Tenchi 
so close to her naked form.  She tucked her hands into the elastic 
around his waist and slowly inched the waistband, down, down.  She eased 
it over his hips, and gasped as she caught sight of that incredible 
erection.  Her nerves (or whatever counterpart she has) danced with 
excitement.  She held her breath.  She moved the pants farther down for 
some comfort.  Tenchi stirred again, and Ryoko began to pray to anything 
that would listen.  He did not wake up.  Ryoko released her breath.
	*OK, here goes nothing!*  Ryoko phased out, at least partially.  
Using that technique that so disturbed all in the Masaki household 
(except Washu, who was oh so proud), Ryoko phased between matter, much 
as when she walked through walls.  She positioned herself over Tenchi, 
and gently brought herself down on his hard member.  
	Although she could not fully feel in this form, it was incredible.  
Tiny sparks of sensation came through, and she could almost sense the 
blood pounding within him.  She felt that he was almost a part of her. 
She closed her eyes, and rocked back and forth, feeling him move through 
her, and she through him.   She began to raise up and down along his 
length. *This may be the closest to paradise I ever get.*  She was 
saddened at the thought.  Then she opened her eyes.  Tenchi was looking 
right at her.
	"RYOKO!"  Tenchi cried. It all happened so fast.  Ryoko lost her 
hold on her power, and phased into full form, just on the downstroke of 
a thrust.  Something inside ripped.
	"Ohhhhhhh...owwwwww!"  She felt like she was torn in two.  Her 
embarrassment was almost worse. She fell off of him and rolled across 
the bed, clutching her abdomen, just as Tenchi sat straight up.
	"What did you think you were doing!" whispered Tenchi, as loudly 
as her could dare.  Ryoko faced away from him.  She bit her lip in pain.  
She was not supposed to bleed.  She was not supposed to feel 
embarrassed, especially around Tenchi.  And yet she did bleed.  And she 
felt waves of shame.  *Damn that Zero.*  She phased into her clothes.  
She curled up in a ball.  Her whole being focused on holding back the 
tears.
	"Geez Ryoko, why are you always...." He trailed off.  For the 
first time, he really looked at her.  "Ryoko, are..are you okay?"  He 
saw the blood on the sheets.  He grabbed for his nose, but felt nothing.  
Realization dawned.  Her stared at Ryoko.  
	"Ryoko, are..are you hurt?  You're..you're bleeding...you don't 
bleed usually..do you?"  Ryoko said nothing.  Tenchi could hear her 
start to sniffle.  He edged across the bed.  "Ryoko, did I hurt you? Did 
I scratch you or something?" Ryoko keened a low wail in response.  
	Tenchi had never seen Ryoko like this.  This vulnerable.  This was 
not the monster that frightened him so in the school battle.  This was a 
real person.  A person he cared very much about.  Tenchi laid a hand on 
her shoulder.  "Ryoko, I'm sorry I was mad, but you never ask me what I 
want.  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to hurt you."
	Ryoko sniffled.  She wiped her eyes with her sleeve.  She turned 
her head toward Tenchi.  "Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  I'll be ok.  It's 
just I thought my first REAL time would be a little different.  
Especially if it was with you."
	"Oh Ryoko, THAT's what the blood....oh gosh.  I didn't think that 
you were a virg..." Ryoko leveled a glare at him that could kill.  
"Well...what I mean was....I mean, I'm sorry.  I..I.. I don't know what 
to say..."  Tenchi stared at her, and something within him clicked.
	Ryoko turned her head back to the wall.  She was about to teleport 
herself as far as possible, when she felt Tenchi's body come into 
contact with her back.  He put his arm around her waist and held her, 
spoon fashion.  She tensed up at first, but then relaxed.  It was the 
first time Tenchi had voluntarily touched her like this.  It was 
wonderful, but at what price!
	"That was my first time too, you know.  Inside a woman I mean," 
Tenchi whispered in her ear.  His voice, usually a bit whiney, seemed 
more like honey at the moment.  She would give all the sake in the world 
for more of this.
	"It felt pretty good though, for me.  I'm sorry that it hurt you.  
Do you want me to get you a towel?"  For the first time Ryoko sensed the 
sticky mess between her legs.  Her earlier and unexpected embarrassment 
came back ten fold.  
	"No its okay..." but Tenchi was already up.  He moved the chair 
from the door, and snuck out.  Ryoko considered leaving, but before she 
could make up her mind, Tenchi was back in a flash.  Her returned the 
chair to its position blocking the door and walked across the room.  
Then he knelt on the floor next to the bed and Ryoko.  
	She almost wanted to turn away, to run, but she didn't.  She 
couldn't. He was looking into her eyes.  Into her.  He put his hand at 
her knee, as the other hand held the damp cloth.  He slowly pushed up 
her skirt to her waist.  Her brain could not register this, and she 
forgot all about phasing out of her clothes.  He gently parted her legs, 
and she could fell the cool wet cloth begin to clean away her blood.  
She could sense every movement, as he moved from the inside of her 
thighs into her core.  She felt like she was about to boil.  The light 
sensations felt like lightning.  She closed her eyes, any pain 
forgotten.  His soft ministrations soon began to make her moan.  But 
suddenly, he stopped.  She felt her universe wrenched from her.  Her 
eyes flew open, just as he began to lower her skirt.  She was about to 
protest, when he stood up and began to take off his pants.  She smiled.
	She tried to sit up, but he pushed her back down on the bed and 
followed her there.  He lay by her side, and whispered, "Let me do 
things for a change."
	Although she wanted to do everything at once to show him how much 
she loved him, she obeyed.  "Let's start at the beginning."
	He kissed her.  First with only the lips, like a soft breeze, but 
then harder.  He opened his mouth, and she hers, and she felt like she 
was being swallowed.  He rolled on top of her.  His tongue ran though 
her mouth, tasting, touching.  He traced the outline of her fangs, and 
she could feel his grin.  She kissed him back with every particle of her 
being.  
	She arched into him, moaning.  His hands found their way to her 
breasts, petting them through her dress.  Instantly, because she wanted 
to be naked she was.  He stopped, and broke their kiss.
	She whimpered.  He looked down at her.  "Ryoko, Could you, ah..put 
your clothes back on?"  
	She pouted, "But Tenchi, why?"
	"Because I like a little mystery."  She stared at him.  Suddenly, 
she understood a lot about men.  At least this one man.  And she 
understood a little more about being a woman.  In a second, she was back 
in her clothes.  She even added a few undergarments, just to make things 
interesting.
	Tenchi grinned, and began to kiss her neck.  His hand found her 
left breast, and he began to trace an outline of her nipple.  She moaned 
in agreement.  He blew air behind her ear, and began to suck on the 
alien point of the lobe.  Goosebumps crept up all over her body as she 
shivered in delight.
	She put her hand on his back slowly scratching in response to his 
actions.  She began to kiss any part of his flesh that came near her 
mouth.  She whimpered as he found another sensitive spot on her neck.
	His finger moved to the zipper of her dress.  She held her breath 
in anticipation.  Upon encountering the bra, he moved back and grinned 
at her.  "Thanks a lot," Tenchi smiled sarcastically.  
	"You asked for it."  He pulled the dress up over her head, 
surprised to discover panties that had not been there a moment ago.  He 
then reached behind her back to try and solve one of the eternal puzzles 
of mankind.  How to undo a bra catch.  After ten seconds and a couple of 
frustrated grunts, Ryoko obliged, and the catch magically separated.  He 
slipped off the bra straps, and watched as those beautiful mounds filled 
his hands.  He stared.  Up to now he had been doing pretty well.  His 
nose was intact.  But he could just feel the blood start to surge...*NO*  
he thought, and he dove in.  
	Ryoko gasped as suddenly he latched his mouth on to one of her 
nipples.  Oh...my....GOD.....she could barely think.  The feeling were 
so sweet.  The pleasure so intense, her toes curled, her teeth ached, 
and she began to rise off of the bed.  Tenchi lifted up his head as he 
felt them rise up, and suddenly they fell back.
	"Watch out with that, will ya?"  Tenchi grinned up at Ryoko.  She 
nodded a dazed reply, still believing she was dreaming.  He return to 
his pleasurable pastime, as his fingers inched up her thigh and into her 
panties.
	She began to squirm.  His finger circled round and round her clit 
as his tongue did the same to her nipple.  Her nails dug into his back 
almost drawing blood.  "TENCHI!!!" She cried.  	
	They stopped.  They listened.  They waited.  Nothing.  Tenchi 
looked up at Ryoko, "Quiet dear, or you'll spoil our fun!!" Ryoko gulped 
and nodded.  She swore to silence, and thanked the heavens that Ayeka 
slept soundly tonight.  Tenchi began his sweet torment again, and she 
was lost to it.
	He left her breast, as he began to move her panties down her legs 
with one hand.  He spread her legs out,  and positioned his himself 
between them.  He could feel her wetness, and was glad that there would 
be no pain this time.  Ryoko took advantage of his pause, though, she 
sat up and grasped her hand around his penis, feeling its fullness.  It 
felt like hot silk over marble.  She gloried in it.  She licked one 
finger, and then pulled back the foreskin (Tenchi is Japanese you know).  
Tenchi shivered, barely able to contain himself.  He pushed her back on 
the bed, and positioned himself.  Slowly began to push into her.
	Ryoko was not about to wait anymore.  She thrust her hips up, and 
claimed his whole length.  They both gasped.  Beyond words.  Hot and 
sweet and powerful.  Ryoko wrapped her long legs around Tenchi's waist, 
and he began to thrust into her, over and over.  She reached for a 
pillow to smother her screams.  Over and over.  Steam and salt.  Over 
and over.  She ball her fists into the sheets.  Tenchi began to growl, 
almost tiger like.  Ryoko responded with her own feline sounds of 
ecstasy, and she dug her claws into his back, leaving her mark.  Her 
pounded into her, and she began to implode.  Thousand of tiny blue and 
white lights exploded behind her eyes as both she and Tenchi came, 
becoming, for an instant, one person.
	They returned to reality a few moments later.  Tired, happy, 
thirsty, and six feet over the bed.  "AKKHKH"  Tenchi grabbed Ryoko even 
harder, if that was possible.  She managed to bring them back down 
safely.  She purred.  She was very good at purring.
	"Happy?"  Tenchi asked.  "Absolutely, Tenchi dear.  And you?" 
	"Um-huh," Tenchi smiled.  "How did I ever wait so long?"  
	"I dunno, you're the dumb one on that account," Ryoko tweaked his 
nose as he stuck out his tongue.
	Ryoko suddenly jumped, "Where did you ever learn all that Tenchi?  
I thought you said I was the first" Ryoko pouted.
	"You know how big a collection of stuff my dad has don't you?  
Every kid my age is a little hentai."  Ryoko actually blushed.  Tenchi 
laughed.  Then he frowned.
	"Oh no, what are we going to do about Ayeka?" 
	Ryoko looked at Tenchi, unsure of herself.  "Do you still like, I 
mean do you still want...."
	"No silly.  I've loved you for longer than I can remember.  I just 
had to get over being scared of you.  Ayeka is nice enough, but WAY too 
stuck up.  Ever since you've calmed down lately, I couldn't stop 
thinking about you, about us.  I...I guess I just needed to break the 
ice."
	"Oh I think the ice is broken."  Ryoko actually giggled.
	"I'm just trying to figure out a way to stop Ayeka from killing 
us!"
	"Oh..."  
	"Maybe we could set her up with somebody...any crown princes 
around here?" Both Ryoko and Tenchi looked at each other.  They giggled.  
They shrugged.  They pulled the covers up over their heads.  That was a 
problem for tomorrow.  Tonight, they had each other.
******************************************************************* 
Okay, okay, how bad am I?
This is my first try, so comments are welcome.  No strange offers 
please.  I'm already taken.  Most of Tenchi's technique is based on him.  
I'm VERY happy.
only comments on my writing, flames, etc to ceclkl@flash.net
