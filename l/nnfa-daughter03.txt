DISCLAIMER:  I DON'T OWN ANY OF THE TENCHI MUYO CHARACTERS..SO DON'T SUE ME.

REVIEW: Ryoko and Aeka explore and establish an intimate relationship
together...Washu doesn't like the sound of it cause of her own past
experiences...In the end..Aeka sleeps with Washu, Ryoko get's mad...and Aeka
ends up...........

"Hmmm..her condition is critical Ryoko, I'm not sure if I can save her."
"God dammit Washu you have to, you're the greatest scientest in the bloody
universe!! YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!!" Ryoko looked at Aeka as she lay on one of
Washu's examination tables. "Oh god Aeka, I am so sorry..I didn't mean for
you...." Ryoko was cut short as one of the moniters beside Aeka started
beeping loudly.
"She's going into cardiac arrest! Ryoko move aside!!" Washu shouted.
Ryoko looked on as Washu began working on Aeka, finally after what seemed
like an hour to Ryoko the beeping stopped.
"What happened, is she alright?" Ryoko whispered.
"She's fine for now, but if she has another episode like she just did, she
might not make it through the night. I am going to keep a close eye on her
tonight, if she holds on for the next 10 hours she'll survive." Washu left
Ryoko and went back to Aeka.
"Aeka..oh my Aeka...I'm so sorry. I promise I'll do everything in my power
to help you, I promise....." Having said that Washu  bent down and picked up
Aeka's bloody Kimono off of the floor. She looked at it and sighed heavily.
"I promise."
*********************************2 WEEKS
LATER***********************************
"Is she alright Washu?"
"Yes, I think so, she'll come to her senses eventually."
"Is she still angry at me?"
"I doubt it, she's probably feeling guitly."
" I can't stand it Washu, I love her."
"I know you do Aeka. Maybe if you talk to her that'll help." Washu placed
her hand on top of Aeka's shoulder reassuring her that Ryoko still loved
her.
"How are the others doing, Do they know about what happened?" Aeka asked.
"They don't know about you and Ryoko, but I told them that you came down
with a rare virus...blah, blah.blah......" Washu trailed off leaving Aeka
wide eyed.
"You told them what!" a shocked look came over Aeka's face.
"Not to worry Princess, I told them I could easily get you better so they'er
not to worry. I also told them that the virus affects the memory. So you
won't rememeber that you got sick, stay cool Aeka I have everything
covered." Washu smiled Aeka and started busing her self with her newest
invention.
***********************************LATER ON THAT
DAY****************************
"This is great Sasami... I haven't had a good meal in such a long time,"
Aeka smiled.
"Thanks sis..ummm.....I made it especially for you," Sasami  looked around
at the others seated at the table, she could tell, just like her, they were
dying to ask Aeka about her encounter with the supposed virus. Finally
someone spoke up, "So Aeka how do you feel?" Mihoshi asked.
Aeka looked up at Mihoshi and smiled, "I feel great, why?"
"Umm.. cause Washu told us you....OUCH!!! Kiyone...why'd you do that for?"
"Oops, my arm spasmed," Kiyone gave Mihoshi and apologetic smile.
"Hey sis have you seen Ryoko?" The question startled Aeka, she coughed on
her rice.
"No I haven't seen that devil, thank god. Why, what'd she do this time, what
part of the house did she destroy this time?" Aeka pretended to have a deep
loathing for the Pirate.
"Well, she hasn't shown up for any of her meals for a few days now." Sasami
got a worried look on her face and glanced down at her half eaten food.
"Nothing to worry about Sasami that demon is probably out drinking her self
into a coma," Aeka said hastily.
"But I'm worried about her," Sasami said as Ryo-oh-ki meowed beside sher.
"She's like a dog Sasami, they always find their way back home..eventually,"
Aeka cringed as she said that. God Ryoko where are you?!? She silently said.
"Bow-Wow," Everyone jumped as Ryoko floated down from the rafters.
"Ryoko!!" Sasami shouted with a smile on her face.
"Got any table scraps for me," Ryoko sarcasticly asked Sasami as she looked
at Aeka.
"I saved some especially for you Ryoko," Sasami chirped as she got up and
got Ryoko's food.
"Thanks Sasami you're a doll," Ryoko took the food and phased out.
"Well atleast she's eating," Kiyone said.
"Yeah...." Aeka sighed as she got up form the table.
"Where you going sis? You haven't finished eating."
"I'm not hungry anymore Sasami, but thanks for the food it was delicious,"
Aeka got up leaving the others in silence.
Aeka decided to go to to onsen and take a bath. Maybe this'll calm my
nerves, she thought as she undressed and lowered her self into the warm,
relaxing water. She passed her hand over her stomach where Ryoko had speared
  her, even though there were no visible scars she could feel where the
tissue was stitched together. Aeka closed her eyes and remembered the look
in Ryoko's eyes when she had realized that it was her she had wounded and
not her mother. "Oh, Ryoko why is this happening? I'm sorry...I..am
sorry..." Aeka buried her face in her hand and began sobbing, she didn't
know what to do, everything was going to hell. With all the power that she
had, she couldn't control this, something simple as this.
"So this is where you ran off to, huh Princess?" The voice made Aeka jump,
she quickly splashed her face with water so it wouldn't look like she was
crying. "Come on Princess, no need to do that."
"I'd like to be alone...please," Aeka turned away from the voice.
"Fine, but only after we talk, then I'll leave," Aeka heard a soft splash
and then felt the water's ripples splash against her as the person moved
closer.
"Please don't come any closer," Aeka heard a soft sigh, and then the water
stopped splashing against her.
"Why are you doing this Aeka?"
"I just..I don't know Ryoko, things have changed," Aeka said still facing
away from Ryoko.
"Please look at me," Ryoko softly said.
'I can't look at you Ryoko,"
"Why can't you look at me, am I a monster now?" Ryoko said  her voice began
to rise.
"No, I just..I can't." Aeka started to move away for Ryoko but a strong hand
grabbed her shoulder and spun her around.
"What is wrong with you?!?" Ryoko shouted.
Feeling cornered Aeka shouted back, "You almost killed me Ryoko! That  is
what's wrong with me, what am I just supposed to forget about it!?!" Aeka
instantly wished she hadn't said anything when she saw that it had hurt
Ryoko.
"Well, if you hadn't gotten in the way, non of this would be happening..no
wait, if you hadn't decided to be a slut and sleep with my mother...."
Before Ryoko could finish she felt a sudden stinging in her left cheek, she
gasped and her hand flew up to her face.
"I HATE YOU!!!!" Aeka brushed past Ryoko gathered her things and left Ryoko
alone still in the water. Crying, she ran up stairs to her room flung
herself onto her bed and cried herself to sleep.
"I've lost her mother,"
"What happened?"
"I lost my temper and..called her a slut,"
"Yeah you're right you lost her,"
"Well jeez, thanks for your support," Ryoko said as she floated with her
legs folded and her arms crossed in  Washu's lab.
"You're to damn hot-headed Ryoko, she is hurting just like you are, give her
time and she'll come around." Washu looked at her daughter and smiled half
heartedly, "I'm sure everything will be alright."
"I hope so Washu, because I don't know what I'd do if I lost her," Ryoko
struggled to hold back her tears.
"You'd probably go back to hounding Tenchi," her mother laughed.
"Yeah..heh..I probably would." Ryoko laughed along with Washu.
******************************************NEXT
DAY*******************************
Aeka didn't have much sleep when she left Ryoko in the onsen. When she
actually did fall  asleep she had nightmares of Ryoko getting killed by
another Ryoko, she'd wake up crying just like how she fell asleep. She woke
up even before Sasami but stayed in bed, she didn't feel like seeing anyone
today, especially not Ryoko.
"I miss you Ryoko," Aeka whispered, she half expected Ryoko to answer her
back but silence was the only reply she got. "Oh god, what the hell am I
doing," She asked herself, " I will not let that demon get me down, I will
get up and be happy...yeah right who am  I kidding?" Dejected she sat back
down on the bed  and rubbed her eyes. "I've got to talk to her, that's what
I'll do, I'll tell her that I love her and then everything will be alright
again. Yes, this has to work." Aeka quickly got up and freshned herself up
and went  looking for Ryoko.
"Kiyone, have you seen Ryoko anywhere?" Aeka asked the Police Officer as she
was coming form the onsen.
"Yeah she in there, she seems really upset about something, when I asked her
about it she snapped at me. So becareful or she might blow your head off,"
Kiyone said as she continued drying her hair with a towel.
"Hmm...thanks Kiyone," Aeka said as she carefully entered the onsen. She
didn't have anything planned to say but she figured she'd take it as it
goes.
"Ummm Ryoko?" Aeka said softly.
With out glancing up Ryoko asked, "What do you want?"
"I'd like to talk with you Ryoko, about what's going on." Aeka moved to the
pool of water and sat at it's edge.
"I'm  not to sure that's a good idea," Ryoko rose up out of the water and
began soaping her body. Aeka gasped as she saw Ryoko's breasts, Just like I
rememeber them,she thought.
"Ryoko, is it really nesessary that you do that now?" Aeka began feeling
that aching in her lower belly.
"I didn't know the sight of my body naked repulsed you so Aeka," Ryoko
looked into her eyes.
"Well, if you must know demon, it makes...me...." Before she could finish
Ryoko burst out laughing.
"Hahahahahahaha!!!"
"What's so funny Ryoko?" Aeka asked her face turning a light shade of red.
Ryoko began moving toward Aeka, her eyes locked on the Princesses.
"It makes you what, Aeka?" Ryoko asked in a seductive voice.
"It makes me....." Aeka whispered.
"It makes you want me doesn't it?" Ryoko finished. She was now only one foot
away from Aeka, "Does it make you want me?" Ryoko asked again as she reached
out and touched Aeka's leg.
The aching in Aeka belly had now gotten stronger and she now had a deep
yearning in her that began to hurt. "Yes," She breathed, "I want you Ryoko,
I need you." Aeka closed her eyes waiting for Ryoko to kiss her.
"Good, now that we have that settled," Aeka's eyes flew open, she saw Ryoko
smiling at her.
"Oh! You wretched creature!" Aeka cried.
"Now, what did you want to talk about?" Ryoko turned around headed back to
where she was soaping herself, she was fighting back urges to just grab Aeka
and make love to her.
"You are  impossible! You know that?!?" Aeka said as she furiously got up
and headed towards the door.
"Aeka, wait!" Ryoko shouted.
"What do you want? To taunt me some more?" Aeka's eyes began to get misty.
"No," Ryoko phased out, and appeared dripping wet in front of Aeka, " I want
you." Ryoko placed her hands on Aeka's hips and pulled her into her. Keeping
her eyes open she covered Aeka's mouth with her own. Suprised Aeka stiffened
at first but after a few seconds she relaxed and began kissing Ryoko back.
"I need you Aeka," Ryoko breathed as she started kissing down Aeka's neck.
"Then take me," Aeka whispered as she buried her hands in Ryoko's hair as
she tipped her head back. Every spot that Ryoko kissed sent shivers through
Aeka. Ryoko began to slowy  kissing a path down the valley between Aeka's
breasts.
"I think it would be much better if you remove her clothes first, Ryoko."
Ryoko and Aeka lightening quick moved away from eachother.
"Mother." Ryoko said.
"Washu," Aeka said in unison with Ryoko.
"You two are lucky I wasn't someone else," Washu said smiling as she walked
past the two love birds, who were still breathing heavily. "Oh, don't mind
me, you two can continue," Washu laughed.
"Perfect timing Washu," Ryoko said sarcasticly as she phased some clothes
on.
"Hey just be glad it was me and not Mihoshi or someone else," Washu dipped
her body into the warm water.
"Well, she does have a point there Ryoko," Aeka said.
"Hmm...Mihoshi, nah she would have joined us," Ryoko smiled devilishly at
Aeka.
"You such a lewd creature," Aeka laughed.
"And that's why you love me Princess," Ryoko moved toward Aeka and ran a
finger down her mid-section.
"I know," Aeka smiled as she moved closer to Ryoko.
"How about you two continue your charade somewhere else?" Washu was washing
her hair.
"What? You're passing up a private show mother?" Ryoko was now behind Aeka
wrapping her arms around her waist.
Washu gave Ryoko a 'get out now before I decide to make you a test subject'
look, "My fingers keep me satisfied dear," Washu snickered.
"Ew, to much information there Washu," Aeka cringed.
"ALL RIGHT MOM!!!" Ryoko cheered.
"Ok,ok you can get out now Ryoko," Washu shooed Ryoko and her lover out of
the onsen.
********************************IN AEKA'S
ROOM**********************************
"Well, where did we leave off?"
"Hmm..I think we  left off right here,"
"Hmm, Yeah, right there...." Aeka tipped her head back letting a soft moan
escape through her partially open mouth.
"Right there? Or was it right here?" Ryoko teased Aeka.
"Don't...tease..me," Aeka whispered.
"Mmmm..heh.." Ryoko slowly let her hands roam Aeka's body, toucing the spots
she knew were Aeka's sensitive spots only slightly.
"Ahh...Mmmm..god.." Aeka was turning Ryoko on with the sounds of pleasure
she was making. Trying hard to hold back  Ryoko slowly undress Aeka, when
her clothes were all off Ryoko took a moment and just looked at Aeka.
Blushing Aeka said, "Ryoko why are you looking at me like that?"
"No reason babe," Ryoko said leaning forward to kiss Aeka.
"No," Aeka moved away from her kiss,"please tell me."
"I came so close to losing you, I don't know what I would have done if you
had died. I love you," Ryoko then covered Aeka's mouth with her own, her
tongue explored  every crevice in Aeka's mouth. She then moved to Aeka's
neck, nipping her...and leaving little red marks along the way. Aeka's whole
body shook with excitement.
"God, how i've missed you, your body, your taste, just you." Ryoko whispered
as she removed Aeka's clothing.
"And...I've.....missed you," Aeka clenched her teeth. Shock waves of
pleasure were cascading throughout her body.  What has she learned since the
last time I had her? Aeka thought.
"Mmmm," Ryoko was savoring the way Aeka's skin tasted. She could feel the
wanting building inside of her, and she was trying hard to hold back her
urges and tend to Aeka.
"Ryoko, I need...to..feel...you," Aeka bit her lip and buried her hands into
Ryoko's Cyan colored hair.
With renewed vigor Ryoko softly kissed a path down Aeka's mid-section,
slowly making her way south of the border.
"Ah, god yes," Aeka's eyes were squeezed tightly shut as Ryoko finally
reached her sweetness, her body shook with anticipation, and pleasure
exploded from within her.  Ryoko kissed her inner..INNER thighs letting her
tongue dart in and out tickling her. Finally her tongue parted Aeka's nether
region and tasted her nectar. Aeka's hands grabbed the back of Ryoko's head
holding it in a vise like grip. A moan escaped her mouth as she clenched her
teeth. Ryoko continued her assult on Aeka's  most sensitive area.
"Ry..oko..don't..stop..I.I'm cumming," Aeka struggled toget the words out.
Ryoko began moving her tongue faster and deepened her 'kiss', she felt the
muscles in Aeka's leg tighten up and ans could feel her back rising up.
"Oh god..Mmmm..don't Ryoko please don't stop," Aeka let out a series of
moans each one louder than the next, then finally her hold on the back of
Ryoko's head loosened and her breathing began calming down.
"Was that fun?" Ryoko asked with a smile on her face as she moved her way up
to Aeka's mouth.
"Mmmm Hmmm" Aeka said still trying to get her breathing under control.
"Good," Ryoko whispered as she covered Aeka's mouth with her own, they layed
together for a long time holding eachother, kissing and touching eathother.
"Isn't it your turn now?" Aeka looked over at Ryoko and gave her a devilish
smile.
"My, my aren't you the fiesty one?" Ryoko smiled back.
"That's why you love me........"

                                                END
