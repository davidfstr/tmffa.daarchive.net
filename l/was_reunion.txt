                   Washu's reunion

 One day Tenchi was planting more carrots for Rio-oke.
Something catches his eye...
"Hhhmmm what is that" he thought to himself?
and he see's something walking down the path to his house.
so Tenchi follows.
he walks up to this mystery man and say "Hello can I help you?
"...the man replied "Yes...does a miss Washu live here?"
"Why yes she does" said Tenchi. " May I see her"
asked the mysterious man.
"Yes I'll take you to her" replied Tenchi. "thank you!"
"No problem" Tenchi exclaims.
but something else catches his eye...I...i..is that a
a power gem on your arm?" "why yes it is".."how did you know?"
 the man said.
"my friend Ryoko has some like that them."  Tenchi said.
"yeah I have a blue one one on each arm, and one on my neck"
the man said."
"Oh sorry let me take you to see miss washu."
" Thanks I almost forgot". they both walk into miss Washu's lab.
"Oh hi Tenchi" Washu said.
"hmmmpf ..i..i.i.is tha..is that ..it is....Oh its Joshua!"
"Hi  little Washu" Joshua said happily.
the greeted each other with a passionate kiss.
"Oh I'll leave now  miss Washu"
"..Dont let the door hit you on the way out!"
"what? ...ouch..." "told ya" ..
"I havent seen you in 19,000 years I thought you died,
"no I'm still live"
"How are you" Washu asked Joshua. "Not so good I'm afraid"
"why?"
 "My gems have been acting up becuase of the quantum time rift"
"Can you do any thing to close it?"
" No..would be my normal answer...but your a highschool sweetheart"
Joshua blushes. Washu advances on Joshua
 she throws him on her bed
...he looks in her eyes
but instead of feeling love and happy memories,
he feel's pain and sorrow.
"Help me forget my horrible memories, Joshua please help me forget"
"I will try my washu"... she pulls off her shirt...
and lays right next to  him. ........

I have had to many dissipointments in my life
but I'm glad you not one of them."
washu pulls off her pants. and says
 "computer, lock the door and turn off your censors"

"I've waited for this moment for 19,000 years
 ever sense we first made love"

Joshua says as he takes off his clothes.
 washu cuddles up next to Joshua.
she kisses him again...
thier tounges exploring and massaging each other
and then he looks in her eyes
*(she is in her adult form)*
.. "You know I love you right, my little washu?"
"I've always known"
"good" Joshua replied.
Joshua starts to caress her body. "mmmhh" Washu moans in pleasure.
then he slowly eases his cock in her pussy.
 "ooooouuuuhhhh" washu moans even louder.
"I guess it's been a while"
 "it has, I was very lonely all those years"
Washu explained.
He takes it out and slides it in again.
"uuuhhhmmm" washu cry's out as reaches her climax
and starts to cum,
so Joshua rams his massive cock in her pussy again,
 this time she screams in agony/pleasure.
"J..Jo...Jos..Josh....Joshua" "Yes Washu..am I hurting you?"
"no not at all, now im making new memories"
he stops....and says "Washu would you like  to live with me?"
"yes I would...be...because I love you"
"you know, I love you too my sweet Washu"
Washu mounts Joshua,
and she starts to ride him like there's no tommorrow.
he wants to blow his load but he doesn't.
..."Joshua?"..."yes?" please cum inside of me.. its been so long.
"......."
he blows his load in her ..tight gentle pussy
"ooooohhhhh yyyeeesss I love the feeling of your cum inside me"
"It feels so good,the warm foam flowing through my pussy again"

"but Ryoko I thought you..."
"No Tenchi you are the first and the last"
"I'm honored Ryoko"
"I'm not to sure how to do this but...."
Ryoko rips off Tenchi's shirt and she's pulling off his shorts
"Ryoko are you sure you want this?"
"yes,my Tenchi"
said Ryoko while laying him onto the bed
"Ryoko this will hurt at first so tell me if you want me to stop!"
"ok Tenchi"
He starts to kiss her then he starts to move down
