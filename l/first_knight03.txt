First Knight
Chapter Three; The first Seductions.
Devon looked at Tenchi, he said, "Look, you agreed to go through with this, you 
only have to seduce four of the girls, Sasami is too young and Kiyone is off 
limits. If you touch her, I'll kill you in a heartbeat."
Tenchi gulped, he knew that Devon meant every word he said. Devon had worked it 
all out for him, if he could over come his fear of women he would be better off. 
So for the last month, Tenchi had been getting special training in the sensual 
arts from Misa. he looked at his friend and teacher, he said, "You don't have to 
worry about me going after Kiyone, she's never shown that kind of interest in 
me. Ours is strictly a platonic friendship, and she was nice to hide behind when 
the other girls got too aggressive."
Devon chuckled, he could see Tenchi hiding behind the tough Galaxy Police 
officer when things got out of hand. The two young men were sitting in their 
favorite spot, a hillside overlooking the house. Devon was sharpening his sword, 
which was now a constant companion. Tenchi watched his friend sharpening the 
blade, he started chuckling. Devon looked up from his work, "What's tickling 
your funny bone?"
"The story Sasami told of how you cured my father of being a hentai."
Devon started to laugh, he wiped tears from his eyes and said, "I didn't 
completely cure him of being a hentai, I just made it plain that it wouldn't be 
healthy to try to get a look at the girls form now on. Especially Kiyone.
"What started it?
"Well do you remember two weeks ago, Kiyone was helping us in the fields."
Tenchi nodded, he said, "And I had to run those errands into town. So we knocked 
off early for the day."
"I went to the floating baths first, because Kiyone wanted to dig out some clean 
clothes first, if you remember Mihoshi had done their laundry and put everything 
away."
Tenchi nodded, and as Devon told the story his mind flashed back on the 
incidents of two weeks ago.
Devon stretched his tired muscles, they were looser now since his soak in the 
baths. He finished drying himself and dressed. He was just finishing dressing, 
when Kiyone walked in. He said to her, "If you'd like I can stay and scrub your 
back for you."
As he said it, he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. Kiyone giggled and said, 
"Get out of here you pervert."
Devon capitulated only after a passionate kiss. He left Kiyone to her privacy, 
and started to make his way back to the house. He was half way to the house, 
when he saw Noboyuki's car in the drive. He thought to himself, "I wonder where 
he's at, maybe I'd better see if he's at the house."
He broke into a jog, and made his way to the house. Inside, he collided with 
Mihoshi, he asked her, "Mihoshi, how long has Noboyuki been home?"
"About half an hour." came her innocent reply. Devon's eyes narrowed, he 
muttered, "What's that old lecher up to."
Then it dawned on him, the guy was going to cop a look at Kiyone. Devon was out 
the door in a flash. Once at the baths, rather than use the elevator, Devon used 
his leaping skill to ascend to the bath and not alert Noboyuki to his arrival.
He found Tenchi's father kneeling behind some bushes, watching Kiyone while she 
bathed. Drawing his sword, Devon placed the blade under Noboyuki's nose. He said 
in a tone of voice only the hentai could hear, "Noboyuki, if I ever catch you 
trying to cop a peak of any of the girls, I'll cut off a portion of your anatomy 
that is highly treasured."
Noboyuki gulped, and vowed never to peek on the girls again.
Tenchi was laughing so hard he was rolling on the ground, he wiped tears from 
his eyes. he said, "Now everytime one of the girls mentions taking a bath, Dad 
always finds things to do in his office."
The two young men sat silently under the tree for a time, Tenchi spoke first, 
"Okay, now that my specialized training is out of the way, which of the girls 
should I seduce first?"
Devon thought for a moment, he said, "I think Mihoshi should be your first, she 
does have somewhat of a crush on you and we could see how far she's willing to 
go."
"Okay, now how do I set the scenario?"
Devon pondered that, he said, "If I remember right, she's going to be working on 
Yagami tonight. She's handling the chores herself, because Kiyone and I have a 
date. you could offer to help her out. And since Ayeka, Ryoko, and Misa are 
taking Sasami to the carnival tonight, you should have plenty of time to make 
your move."
Tenchi nodded, then returned to the house to plan his mission for the night. 
Devon sat alone for a time, he thought to himself, "Oh father, am I doing right 
by Yosho's grandson? Sometimes I wonder if I really want to be a Knight 
Protector."
Then he realized that his life was pretty crazy and he wouldn't have it any 
other way. He rose and went to get ready for his date with Kiyone.
********************************************
The house was in an uproar, the girls were running around trying to get ready to 
go. Devon and Tenchi sat on the couch observing the uproar. Tenchi said, "Thanks 
for helping me come up with the excuse for not going to the show."
"It's a legit excuse, you're going to be doing some special training in Yagami's 
gym. You need some time in zero-g combat. Well that's what everyone thinks."
Mihoshi came out in her GP uniform, she smiled at Tenchi, asking brightly, "Are 
you ready to go Tenchi."
"Uh-huh, we'd better get going."
Devon winked at Tenchi, as his friend followed Mihoshi out the door. Kiyone saw 
the wink and wondered why he'd done that.
****************************************
Yagami was quiet, Mihoshi said, ÏYou know where the gym is, Tenchi, so you can 
get started on the training."
Tenchi smiled, he said, "Devon said there was no hurry, so I can help you with a 
systems check."
"Thanks, I sure could use the help."
They went to the control room, where Mihoshi began running the systems check. 
She Tenchi sent to do certain jobs. Mihoshi spent the next two hours running 
around like a crazy person trying to get everything right. She finally sat down 
to take a rest and that's when Tenchi made his move. He stepped up behind her 
and began to massage her shoulders, "Oh, Tenchi, that feels so good." she 
sighed.
Bending down, Tenchi began to kiss her neck, Mihoshi gasped, ÏWhat are you 
doing, Tenchi."
Tenchi didn't reply, but began to nibble on her earlobe, Mihoshi began 
trembling. Tenchi pulled her out of the chair, and began kissing her 
passionately.
Picking her up, he carried her to her quarters. He stood her in front of the 
bed, and began unbuttoning her uniform blouse. Pushing it off her shoulders, he 
gazed at her opulent breasts. Then he unfastened her bra. Tenchi bent and kissed 
Mihoshi's turgid nipples, she grasped his head and pulled him tighter against 
her.
As he kissed her breasts, he unfastened her slacks, pushing them and her panties 
down her lush hips. Stepping back from her, he gazed at her lush nakedness. Then 
he began to undress, when he was naked he pulled Mihoshi against him. She gasped 
when she felt his erection press against her belly. He kissed her again, then 
lay her down on the bed.
Mihoshi was trembling, as Tenchi lay down beside her. He began kissing his way 
down her body, pausing at her breasts to lave her nipples with his tongue. He 
continued on down her taught belly to the core of her womanhood. Tenchi lapped 
gently at her clit and it excited her further, she moaned, "Oh Tenchi, don't 
stop!"
Tenchi continued to lap at her until she orgasmed, he raised up and kissed her 
on her lips. Mihoshi pushed Tenchi back down on the bed, she kissed her way down 
his lean muscular body to his throbbing manhood. She began to lick it gently, 
Tenchi groaned. She then engulfed him in her hot mouth. Sucking gently, she 
coaxed him to an astonishing orgasm. Mihoshi took his entire load in her mouth.
They lay side by side panting gently, Mihoshi took Tenchi's limp member in her 
mouth again and began to coax it back to life once more. Tenchi gasped as 
pleasure began to rush through his groin. His manhood swelled to hardness, he 
pulled Mihoshi up and kissed her.
Rolling her gently onto her back, mounted her. He slowly entered her causing her 
to groan in pleasure, moving slowly and gently Tenchi began to thrust in and 
out. Mihoshi panted excitedly, then begged, "Faster, please Tenchi."
Tenchi increased the speed of his thrusts, and Mihoshi's groans intensified. 
Tenchi felt his own orgasm approaching. He began to thrust even faster, and soon 
Mihoshi cried out in pleasure as her orgasm ripped through her. Tenchi cried out 
as his orgasm approached and released.
He collapsed on top of her and tried to catch his breath. Mihoshi wrapped her 
arms and legs tightly around him and kissed him gently. Tenchi rolled off of her 
and pulled her against his side.
***************************************************
While Tenchi and Mihoshi were getting intimate, Devon and Kiyone were enjoying 
their date, but Kiyone was curious about the wink Devon had given Tenchi, before 
Tenchi had left with Mihoshi.
As they returned to the house, she asked him about it, "Devon, what was that 
wink you gave Tenchi all about?"
"You saw that did you."
Kiyone nodded, Devon said, "Well, I guess I can let you in on the secret. If I'm 
right and Misa's training has helped, by now Tenchi has seduced and made love to 
Mihoshi."
Kiyone was stunned, "But why would you want him to do that."
Devon replied, ÏBecause Tenchi has to make a choice."
As they continued to walk towards the house, Devon laid it all out for young 
woman, she asked, "Why wasn't I included in this?"
"Because, your friendship with Tenchi is platonic, and I told him if he put the 
moves on you I'd kill him in a heartbeat."
Kiyone was stunned, she didn't realize that Devon's feelings for her matched 
hers for him. She said, "Do you love me, Devon?"
He looked at her seriously, then said, ÏI think I fell in love with you the 
first time I laid eyes on you."
Kiyone took his hand and said, "Then I want you to make love to me."
Devon pulled his love into his arms and kissed her. Leaving the path, the soon 
to be lover wandered in the woods to Funaho. There Devon pulled Kiyone into his 
arms and kissed her passionately. His nimble fingers began unbuttoning her 
blouse, while her fingers unbuttoned his shirt. They pushed the off each others 
shoulders, letting them fall to the ground.
Even though Kiyone had seen Devon's bare torso many times this was the first 
time she'd ever laid her hands on his naked flesh. She ran her hands over his 
muscular torso, and he groaned in pleasure from her caresses. Devon unfastened 
her bra and pushed it off her shoulders as it opened from the front. His hands 
brushed over her large breasts and her nipples hardened, she moaned softly. 
Devon bent and kissed her nipples, sucking at them gently. Kiyone's groans 
intensified, she ran her hands through Devon's hair, pulling him closer and 
unfastening his hair clasp.
Devon undid Kiyone's skirt and pushed it down her hips along with her panties, 
while she unfastened his jeans and pushed them and his undershorts down his 
hips. Pulling Kiyone tight against him, Devon kissed her deeply. He heard her 
gasp as his turgid erection pressed against her firm belly. Kiyone broke the 
kiss and began kissing her way down Devon's body, she was on her knees in front 
of him. She took his raging erection in her mouth, and began sucking gently.
She pulled it out with an audible pop, and began licking the underside, she was 
rewarded by Devon's deep groan. He whispered fiercely, "Enough, now let me 
pleasure you."
He pulled her up and began kissing his way down her body, when he reached her 
pussy, he parted her lips and licked at her clit. She moaned in ecstasy. Devon 
lapped at her gently until she orgasmed. The orgasm brought her to her knees.
Laying down on the warm ground, Kiyone pulled Devon atop her. She waited while 
he positioned himself and slid his dick into her slick womanhood. Kiyone groaned 
as Devon's erection slid into her. She wrapped her long legs around his hips, 
she whispered, "Don't move just yet."
Devon didn't move, until Kiyone began to move her hips. He began thrusting 
slowly and gently at first. His movements intensified as Kiyone picked up speed. 
Their bodies thrust frantically together. Devon felt his balls beginning to 
tighten as his climax approached. As his orgasm approached, he gasped, "I'm 
cumming!"
He felt Kiyone's internal muscles tighten as her orgasm approached. They cried 
out together as their orgasms flared through them. They collapsed, panting 
heavily, still joined. Devon rolled to his side and cradled Kiyone's body in his 
own. When they had rested, they dressed and made their way hand in hand to the 
house. Devon asked her, "Will you stay in my room tonight?"
Kiyone replied, "Tonight and every night, my love."
******************************************
Mihoshi was quiet on the trip back to earth, she'd never thought anything like 
this would happen. Now she was really unsure about her feelings for Tenchi. 
She'd never realized that he was this aggressive. She turned to him, "Tenchi, I 
enjoyed what happened, but...."
Tenchi smiled gently, "You're not sure what kind of perspective you have on your 
feelings for me."
"Yeah, that's right."
Tenchi hugged her, he said, "Take all the time you need, Mihoshi. Whatever you 
decide, I hope we can still be friends."
The shuttle landed and the two made their way to the house, it was dark. Only a 
porch light was on. They stepped inside, took off their shoes and made their way 
to their separate rooms.
Tenchi grabbed a robe and made his way to the bathroom and took a shower. He 
went back to his room, put on pajamas, climbed into his bed and was soon asleep. 
Mihoshi also took a bath, but later she lay awake for a time, trying to sort out 
her feelings for Tenchi.
==========================
The next morning, Tenchi was up early as usual. He dressed for his morning run, 
and found Devon waiting for him on the porch. The two started running slowly, 
while they jogged. As it always happened the last five miles became an all out 
run as they pushed themselves to the limit and beyond. Back at the house, they 
rested on the porch. Devon asked, "Well, how did it go?"
"Okay, I guess. Mihoshi is still unsure of her feelings. But I think I can say 
that it'll take her time to sort them out."
Devon nodded and looked at his student, "Tonight, Washu."
Tenchi nodded in agreement, Devon spoke again, "Let's see what Sasami has ready 
for breakfast. Then we grab our bokkens and head for the woods."
Tenchi nodded and the two men headed inside.
============================================
Several hours later, Washu was checking the monitors in her lab, when the 
proximity alarms went off, checking the scanners, she saw a familiar form 
approaching earth. Her communications console began beeping. She activated the 
screen and saw a familiar face looking at her, it was Funaho, she said, "Washu, 
please inform the family we will be arriving shortly."
"Of course, Lady Funaho. Everyone will be pleased that you are here."
Funaho smiled and the screen blanked, Washu went to tell Yosho that the Royal 
family was arriving. Upon being told, Yosho's reaction was normal. He wished he 
was somewhere else.
=====================================================
Sasami was excited, she said, "Oh Ayeka, Mommy will be here soon. Isn't it 
wonderful"
"Yes Sasami, it will be good to see Mother and Father again." Ayeka said as she 
helped Sasami dress in a formal kimono. After helping her little sister, she 
changed into her own formal kimono. She thought to herself,<I wonder where Lord 
Tenchi and Devon are?>
Before she could think of an answer, a large shadow loomed over the house. The 
family has arrived.
The two girls joined the others, in rushing out to meet them. The only one's who 
weren't about were the boys.
The royals materialized, Azusa was standing arrogantly ahead of his wives. The 
family bowed to him. Then Sasami approached her mother, "Mommy, I'm sooo glad to 
see you" she said kawaiily. Misaki pulled her younger daughter to her in a 
bonecrushing hug. Then Misaki went to her older daughter, "Ayeka, my baby."
"Mommy," said Ayeka kawaiily. Misaki gave Ayeka a bonecrushing hug, just like 
she'd given Sasami. Then she approached Misa, who was holding Riko. She took 
Riko from Misa and gave her a softer bearhug, The toddler gasped, "Gramma."
Riko was then handed to Funaho, and Misa was pulled into Misaki's enthusiastic 
hug, Misa gasped, "Mommy."
Azusa spoke arrogantly, "And where is my great grandson."
Yosho said, "He is out practicing, with his new teacher."
"Why aren't they here to greet us."
Washu spoke up, "Because they don't know you're here."
=======================================================
A little earlier the two young men were working up a powerful sweat, their 
bokkens clacking hard against one another. As they practiced a large shadow 
loomed over them. Devon looked up, he said, "Hey, Tenchi. I think we've got 
company."
Tenchi looked up, he groaned, "Oh great, King Azusa has come. He and his wives 
will be here for about a week."
Devon said, "Well, then we'll postpone Washu's seduction for a while."
Tenchi said, "Oh great, Azusa's gonna be pissed that we weren't there to greet 
him."
Devon looked at his friend, then grinned, he said, "Well then let's take the 
shortcut over the trees."
The two men began to run through the forest at astonishing speeds. They 
approached the trees that bordered the house. Without slowing their momentum, 
the two warriors leaped up emitting the spiritual warcry, "Kiai!"
The family heard the cry, and turned to see two figures leaping and spinning 
over the trees. Tenchi landed facing the Royals, he bowed deeply to them. Misaki 
bounded forward with a glad cry, she said, "Oh Tenchi it's so good to see you."
She grabbed the young man and gave her usual bonecrusher. Tenchi gasped and 
said, "It's good see you too, Auntie."
Azusa said, "And who is this young man."
Devon had landed with his back to the Royals, he spoke before turning, "I'm 
Tenchi's new instructor."
Funaho gasped, "That voice is one from the past, Ian Kane is that you."
Devon turned to face them, "No, my lady. Not Ian Kane, but his only son, Devon."
Funaho said, "And where is your father?"
Devon smiled sadly, he said, "He and my mother died when I was less than three 
months old."
Misaki wiped a tear from her eye, then grabbed Devon in her usual embrace. 
Devon's eyes bulged as her felt the grip of the blue haired woman. Devon felt 
his bones begin to crack, then Funaho got her sister to break the hold. Azusa 
cleared his throat, he spoke arrogantly, "Have you no sign of respect for your, 
Emperor."
Devon looked him up and down and said, ÏMaybe, then again maybe not."
"You are insolent, I guess you come by it naturally."
Devon smirked at Azusa, then said, "I thank you from the bottom of my heart, 
your Majesty."
Azusa's face suffused with blood as his anger, began to surface. Funaho and 
Misaki began to giggle, they realized Devon was just like his father.
Just then another transport beam, deposited another person on the lawn. A fancy 
dressed pink haired man. Everyone except Devon and Azusa groaned. It was the 
forgettable Prince Seiryo. Devon turned to Tenchi, he asked, "Who's the fairy?"
Devon choked on his laughter, but before he could reply, Seiryo spoke haughtily, 
"I, Seiryo have returned to challenge Lord Tenchi to our interrupted dual. This 
time there will be no distractions."
Devon knew this was a challenge that he himself would have to meet, before 
Tenchi could reply, Devon said, "As Lord Tenchi's Knight Protector, I must take 
up the challenge first. If you can defeat me you can fight Tenchi."
Azusa, Funaho, and Misaki were startled, by Devon's pronouncement. As was 
Seiryo. Devon spoke without taking his eyes off Seiryo, "Kiyone, would you go 
and get my sword from our room, please."
Kiyone ran into the house and returned a moment later with Devon's ninja to. She 
handed it to Devon, then stepped back. The young ninja slung the sword across 
his back and tied it into place. Seiryo smirked, "You're going to fight a 
Juraian laser sword with a piece of human made junk." he said insultingly.
Devon drew his sword, his eyes narrowing. Everyone stepped back to give the 
combatants room. Devon said, "You have insulted me, my family. Now you insult my 
sword. I'll show you junk, you popinjay."
Devon tightened his grip on the sword handle, and everyone watched as the blade 
began to glow. Azusa whispered, "Lighthawk energy."
The two men began to circle, then Seiryo rushed at Devon his energy blade 
humming and flashing. Devon parried the slash neatly. As he blocked the blow he 
kicked Seiryo in the ribs with a snapping sided kick. Both men jumped back and 
prepared for another attack. Devon leaped high with a savage cry, bringing his 
sword down for an overhand chop. Seiryo barely blocked it. Seiryo slashed out at 
Devon and missed. Devon jumped in with a side thrust, Seiryo blocked again. 
Devon looked bored, it was then that Tenchi realized Devon was playing with 
Seiryo.
Seiryo made a slash and cut Devon's sleeve and slightly drew blood, Devon's eyes 
lit with a menacing light. Reversing his grip so his sword hung down, Devon 
began to whirl it in a figure eight. Faster and faster he began to whirl it. The 
glowing blade flashed, as it became a blur. Whirling the sword, he moved towards 
his opponent. His left fist shot out, striking Seiryo on the chin. Seiryo 
staggered back, and Devon moved deceptively fast. The blade slashing, everyone 
saw SeriesÌ pants drop to his ankles. Devon sheathed his sword and stalked 
towards his enemy. Stopping, he set himself and launched a spinning back kick. 
He caught Seiryo on the chin, staggering the noble. Two more kicks came, the 
third kick dropping Seiryo in the dust. Devon growled at Azusa, "Get that piece 
of shit off the front lawn."
Devon bowed to the ladies and went into the house. The others followed, except 
Azusa. He called the ship and had Seiryo transported aboard. He thought to 
himself, <Getting rid of Tenchi is going to be harder than I thought.>
The next week was a busy one, Funaho and Misaki got to know Devon better. And 
they observed his training sessions with Tenchi. Whenever Azusa would make one 
of his announcements, Devon would walk behind him and give him rabbit ears. This 
would set the rest of the family to giggling. Or he would scratch his nose with 
his middle finger, which was a symbol of disrespect unknown to Azusa.
Misaki went on one run with the boys and found out it wasn't as easy as it 
looked. She also practiced with Devon and found out that he was better than he'd 
shown when fighting Seiryo. All too soon the family left. The day they did, 
everyone in the house sighed with relief.
========================================================
That evening, Devon spoke to Washu. He said, "You know Washu, Tenchi might be 
uncomfortable about making any advances towards you, because you look like a 
little girl."
Washu thought about it and decided Devon could be right, so she made herself 
older and more mature looking.
Devon spoke to Tenchi, "Washu is in her lab. I think you should go see her right 
now."
Everyone else was asleep, and Devon had given the cabbits a huge basket of 
carrots.
Tenchi slipped into Washu's lab. He found the scientist seated at her computer, 
he said, "Good evening Washu."
"Hello Tenchi, how can I help you."
Tenchi just smiled, he lowered his head and kissed her. Washu was startled, but 
then she allowed the kiss to deepen. She stopped the kiss and led Tenchi to 
another room. It was a bedroom. She watched him and noticed he wasn't nervous, 
that aroused her curiosity. But she didn't have time to puzzle on it. Tenchi 
kissed her again, moving from her lips to her jawbone, then to her neck. She 
moaned softly, Tenchi stood behind her and unbuttoned her blouse.
Tenchi unfastened Washu's bra and cupped her large breasts, taking her nipples 
between his index fingers and thumbs. he coaxed them to hardness. Washu moaned 
again. She turned and pulled Tenchi's shirt over his head. Their naked upper 
bodies came together as they kissed again. Washu ran her hands up his back, 
caressing him gently. She lowered her hands to his waist and brought them around 
to the fastenings of his pants. Tenchi was unfastening her skirt. Soon both were 
naked and on the bed.
Washu brought all of her experience into play. She coaxed Tenchi to hardness 
with her mouth. She sucked him gently, causing him to writhe with pleasure. When 
he orgasmed the first time she drank his cum without losing a drop. Tenchi 
kissed his way to her woman hood. He lapped gently at her, tasting the sweetness 
of her juices. She moaned with pleasure. Her orgasm struck her like lightning. 
She cried out her pleasure.
They lay in a loose embrace, kissing gently. Washu stroked her young lover back 
to hardness, then pushed him on his back. Throwing a shapely thigh over his she 
straddled him and seized his erection and lowered herself onto it with a sensual 
groan.
When he was embedded deep within her, she began to ride him gently. Bouncing 
slowly at first, then increasing her speed. Both of them groaned as their 
pleasure increased. Tenchi felt his balls begin to tighten. He grabbed Washu's 
hips and began raising and lowering her more swiftly. He felt her inner muscles 
begin to tighten, and his own orgasm begin to build.
Suddenly they both felt the lightning as they orgasmed simultaneously. Washu 
collapsed on top of Tenchi, both of them panting heavily. She kissed his lips 
and lay her head on his chest.
They made love once more, then Tenchi returned to the house. Washu had hoped for 
this moment, but now that it had happened. She felt letdown, she loved Tenchi, 
but now she realized it wasn't the passionate love she'd hoped for. What had 
happened tonight made her realize it.
==========================================================
Tenchi smiled to himself, he realized that his feeling for Washu were not 
passionate and now he could concentrate on the two women who seemed to want him 
the most.
Tomorrow he would see what Ayeka's reaction to his seduction plans would be.
