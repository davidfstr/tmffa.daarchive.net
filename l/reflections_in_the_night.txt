A Family Affair: Reflections in the Night

Tenchi Muyo Fanfiction by Kaitouace

*********************************************************************

It was a normal day at the Masaki household......

Well actually not really.  It was rather quiet.  Tenchi was out in
the garden and Ryo-oh-ki tagged along with him.  Washu was in her
lab as usual.  Ryoko and Aeka apparently took their constant fight
outside for the time being.  Kiyone and Mihoshi hadn't invited
themselves over for lunch.  Nobuyuki was still at work and Katsuhito
was at the temple.  And......for one glorious moment, Sasami wasn't
working.  She had the house all to herself and was sprawled on the
couch watching television.

Lately Sasami had taken a fancy to old style family programming.  It
reminded her of her own semi-adoptive family.  They were always
involved in strange adventures but always seemed to solve whatever
problems they had and went back to normal.  Sometimes as quickly as
......well...a half hour.

	"Bobby, I'm scared of the thunder.  Can I sleep with you?"

	"Sure sis.  Hop in."

Sasami sighed to herself.  It'd be nice to have a family like that.
But with "her" family.......but then again.  There was always
Tenchi.  He was as close to a brother as she had.  Not counting
Yosho, of course.  Not to mention he WAS the most normal member of
the household.  It was HIS household after all.  Sasami wondered
to herself.

	"Would he mind?  Just this once?"

Sasami blushed at the idea but soon sighed in defeat.  She couldn't
ask Tenchi that.  She'd never have the nerve.

	"I love you Bobby."

	"I love you too."

	[TV Audience] "Awwwww...."

........But then again......maybe she did.





Tenchi came in from the vegetable garden with Ryo-oh-ki close
behind nipping at the basket he was carrying.

	"Tenchi-niichan, Ryo-oh-chan....welcome home."

Tenchi smiled as Ryo-oh-ki left the basket and took her usual
position perched on Sasami's head.

	"Hi Sasami-chan.  What's going on?"

Sasami froze in embarrassment.  Should she ask him now?  No.  It
was a silly idea to begin with.  She should just forget it.
Tenchi saw her confusion and was generally concerned.

	"Is something wrong?"

Sasami jumped as she noticed Tenchi in her face, looking a little
worried.

	"Ohh!  Not...really.  I was just watching television."

	"....Oh.  Well I'll just put this basket in the shed then."

Tenchi shrugged the situation off and turned to leave.  But before
she knew what she was doing, Sasami spoke quickly.

	"Tenchi-niichan!"

She couldn't believe she was doing this.  Even her sister didn't
have the courage to ask this blatantly.  But her mind was thinking
to itself as her mouth continued unabated.

	"Ummm.....we're practically family, right?"

Tenchi thought for a second, then answered.

	"Yeah.  We are related by blood, right?  I forget.  It's REAL
confusing.  We're siblings or are you my niece or.....?"

Tenchi stood lost in thought as he tried to create the entire Jurai
family tree in his head.  He never really thought about it before
but it was pretty interesting, if totally incomprehensible.
Sasami stood patiently but suddenly she blurted out her request,
knocking Tenchi out of his endless mental trip of his own genealogy.

	"Well.....I was wondering if just once......"

Tenchi stared at Sasami, wondering what was on her mind.  He didn't
have long to wait, however."

	"...Could I sleep with you?!?!  But I know you don't want to
and it's OK but you're like my brother and brothers and sisters
sleep together sometimes at least on TV and I thought it would be
nice and actually forget what I said.  I have cooking to do and
I'm sorry I brought it up and........"

	"Sasami-chan."

Tenchi put a hand on her shoulder and she jumped.  She slowly
opened her eyes, which were shut the whole time and saw a smiling
Tenchi.  Her wonderful brother.

	"I understand.  It's no problem.  Really."

Sasami's mind slowly processed his answer and jumped for joy.  Her
face beamed brightly and she was about to leap into Tenchi's arms
when Tenchi's face became very serious surprising her.

	"Sasami-chan.  You have to promise me one thing."

Sasami saw the look on Tenchi's face and became nervous.

	"Wh...what is it?"

Tenchi's frown turned back into a smile.

	"Don't let your sister know."

Tenchi laughed a bit and Sasami followed suit.  She relaxed as she
had a request of her own.

	"You just make sure Ryoko-oneechan doesn't find out."

They laughed again but for some reason that comment filled Tenchi
with a small sense of dread.






	"Wow Sasami-chan!  What a huge dinner!  It's more.......than a
man like me deserves...."

Nobuyuki barely managed to finish his sentence before bursting into
tears.  He was as impressed as everyone else.  Sasami was a very good
cook but the feast that was laid before the family took them all
completely off-guard.  Even Katsuhito was impressed.

	"I agree.  You've outdone yourself today Sasami-chan.  What's
the occasion?"

	"......Huh?  OH!"

Sasami was surprised by the question.  She had been thinking about
Tenchi nonstop since their talk.

	"Ummm....no reason.  Really.  I...I just felt like it."

Sasami blushed to herself as Ryoko spoke through mouthfuls of food.

	"WELL.....I wish you felt like it more often."

Tenchi shook at the comment and tried to speak but was too late as
Aeka chimed in determined to embarrass the space pirate.

	"Please Ryoko-san.  Could you be just a BIT more polite at the
table?  Some of us are trying to eat."

Ryoko didn't appreciate the attack on her somewhat questionable
eating habits.

	"Mind your own business you old maid."

	"................WHAT DID YOU CALL ME!!!!!"

Aeka had had enough as she slammed her hands on the table and rose to
her feet.  Now it was Ryoko's turn as she smirked at the angry
princess.

	"Ohhhhh.....want another lesson in humility I see."

      "The one who needs an education is YOU!"

Tenchi sighed to himself as he slowly ducked for cover.  The others
followed suit.  But Sasami wasn't paying attention.  She was too
excited about what was to come.  She just sat and stared into space
even as her carefully cooked meal flew past her in handfuls.

	*SIGH*  "I can't wait."





Aeka had finally fallen asleep.  Sasami had thought she would never
be able to get past her without waking her.  She quietly got out of
her futon on the floor and headed for the door.  As she passed her
sister she heard mumblings of Tenchi-sama.  Sasami couldn't help but
giggle to herself.

	"Boy.  Oneesama would sure be jealous."

Sasami stood there for a second thinking about the irony of the
situation before she remembered why she was awake in the first place
and swiftly left the room.
Tenchi laid in bed deep in thought.  He knew Sasami was on the way.
But, as expected, he was having second thoughts.

	"I hope she doesn't get the wrong idea or anything."

Tenchi was pondering the situation with all the indecisiveness he
could muster.  But even he soon dismissed the idea as silly.

	"No.  She just sees me as a big brother and big brothers sleep
with their little sisters from time to time.  Besides, it might be
fun.  Having someone to talk to for a bit......huh?"

Tenchi's thoughts were interrupted when he heard a quiet knock on
the door.

	"Ummm.....Tenchi-niichan?"

	"It's open.  Come on in Sasami-chan."

Sasami slowly walked in and Tenchi was a bit surprised by her
wardrobe.

	"I didn't know they had pajamas in Jurai."

Sasami was wearing light blue pajamas with large carrots strewn about
them.

	"Of course we do silly.  Besides, this way it's more like a
sleepover type party."

Tenchi didn't exactly make a habit out of peeking into peoples rooms
but he knew that Aeka usually wore strange outfits to bed.  He was
sure it was just normal Jurai clothing but he expected Sasami to be
wearing something similar......more alien.  But seeing her look so
normal......so cute......

He shook the images out of his head as he realized Sasami was staring
at him confused.  He shrugged it off and moved over a bit.  Sasami
slowly climbed in the bed and sat.  She was still quite nervous.  She
caught their reflection in a mirror and couldn't believe it.  It was
like watching someone else on television.  She quickly turned to
Tenchi with an odd question.

	"Tenchi-niichan, I'm scared of the thunder.  Can I sleep with
you tonight?"

Now it wasn't raining and Tenchi was obviously confused.  However,
the look on Sasami's face brought a smile to his lips and he gave his
answer.

	"Sure.  Hop in."

Sasami's face lit up and she hugged her brother tightly.





After talking for a bit, Sasami became tired and soon fell asleep.
Tenchi covered her small body with the blanket and started to turn
his back to her.  But before he had the chance, Sasami shoved into
him and snuggled close.  He wasn't quite expecting this and was
taken by surprise.  At this angle he looked over Sasami's back at
his mirror so he could see her face.

	"......So peaceful.  Well, best not to disturb her."

He draped his arm over her and slowly drifted to sleep.......or so he
thought.  Tenchi was afraid of this.  He was a bit.....uncomfortable
with this situation.  He WAS a young man after all and couldn't
really completely ignore the young girl in his bed.  Of course he
wasn't thinking anything perverted but it would be mighty
embarrassing if Sasami was woken up by a certain.....poking in her
back.  So Tenchi once again tried to turn his back to her.  But once
again Sasami's position restricted his movement.  But Tenchi was
determined.  He managed to move his arm and get to his back.

	"Halfway there."

Sasami felt the lack of warmth and unconsciously reached back,
grabbing Tenchi's hand.  She brought it all the way back over her and
held it fast.  Instead of having his arm removed from his socket,
Tenchi had no choice but to reluctantly move back to his original
and now even closer position.

After relaxing again, Tenchi felt something different.  Apparently
all that shuffling shifted the position of Sasami's top and his hand
was being held on her bare stomach.  Tenchi immediately tried to move
his hand but Sasami's grip remained firm.  He pulled a bit harder but
things went from bad to worse.  Sasami lost her grip but caught it
once again.  But in trying to escape, Tenchi's hand caught her top
bringing the front almost to her neck.  His hand was right below her
small breasts.

Tenchi was at a loss.  He couldn't stay like THAT.  He caught another
glance in the mirror and looked at her cute face.  Her small chest
going in and out.  Her tiny breasts moving up and down.  Up and down.
Up and......

	"....NO!  What am I THINKING?!?  I'm no pedophile!"

Tenchi's mind blared at him shaking him out of his trance.  He
decided to wake Sasami up and ask her to leave.....or at least change
position.....or at least......

But before he knew it, he was watching his reflection.....as it
slowly slid it's hand under Sasami's shirt.  He was mesmerized by the
sight.  It was like it wasn't him but he could still feel it.  Sasami
sharply caught her breath but settled back into sleep.  Tenchi then
slowly cupped her breast, her tiny nipple between his middle and
index finger.  Carefully he moved it around causing Sasami to moan
incoherently in her sleep.  He closed his fingers slightly and she
moaned louder as it stiffened in Tenchi's grasp.  Tenchi unknowing
smiled to himself as he caressed Sasami's lithe body.  After a few
minutes of this, Tenchi couldn't help but turn his attention
elsewhere.

But that would be going TOO far as Tenchi's mind once again tried to
be the voice of reason.  But Tenchi seemed lost in the illusion of
the mirror.  He removed his hand from her breast and slowly slid it
down to the waist of her pajama bottom.  He took his finger and
slowly lifted the waistband.  Sasami squirmed for a second and
Tenchi froze.  She soon settled down however and Tenchi moved on.  He
deftly inserted his hand and felt the softness of Sasami's panties.
He sighed at the warm feeling.  Tenchi gently cupped the crotch and
Sasami squealed softly.  He then very softly and carefully rubbed
his middle finger back and forth across the center of Sasami's
panties tickling her virgin girlhood.  At this point Sasami didn't
seem to respond but began breathing much heavier.

Tenchi, now fully engulfed by the beautiful body next to him,
basically had no choice but to break the final barrier.  He wanted,
no needed, full contact.  He slowly lifted his hand and brought it
back to the top of Sasami's panties which he now noticed were
slightly damp.  He took his fingers and carefully slid his hand into
her panties while moving his hips back as to not have his now large
erection thrust into Sasami's rear.  His index finger started to
work around as it felt the outer lips of Sasami's nether region.
Tenchi then ran his finger along the thin slit in the middle causing
Sasami to shudder.  But at this point, he was hardly paying
attention.

Tenchi didn't know too much about the female anatomy but had heard
rumors of a small nub just below the surface that was supposed to
bring women to ecstasy.  He desperately wanted to touch it but that
wouldn't be possible unless.......

After a second of thought, Tenchi took his middle and ring fingers
and slowly parted Sasami.  He was ready for the final step of his
erotic journey when he glanced into the mirror one last time.....and
froze.  The slim stomach, the long legs, the pert breasts, the
slowly quivering crotch......all this vanished.  All he could see was
Sasami's large pinkish eyes as they started back at him, cutting him
to his very soul.  Tears started to form from them but she held them
back trying to remain as emotionless as possible.

	"....Stop........please."

Her timid voice seemed like a frantic scream in the dark room.
Tenchi was shaking.  He couldn't believe what he had just done.  In
his fear he forgot where his hand was and slightly brushed Sasami's
insides with his middle finger.  She gasped as her eyes turned from
emotionless to frightened.  Tenchi quickly removed his hand and let
go of her.  She laid there for a moment but soon stood up and
adjusted her clothes.

	"I'm sorry Tenchi-niichan.  I shouldn't have asked to do this.
It's all my fault.  I....I better go back to my room."

Sasami slowly walked to the door and stopped.  Waiting for Tenchi to
say something.  Something to make it all right like he always did.
But there was only silence.  Tenchi wanted to speak, to move, to cry
and beg for forgiveness.  But he did nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
All he could do was watch as Sasami drooped her head as she opened
the door and left the room.  Tenchi just lay there in the darkness.
Just him, his reflection, and his shame.

P.S.  I wrote this out of spite for Tenchi but I AM considering
adding another part to it to "make it all better."  Lemon action may
or may not be involved.  If you want a happy ending, let me know and
maybe I'll swallow my pride and let Tenchi off the hook.  Or I might
