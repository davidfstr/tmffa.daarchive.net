Part 2 Ryoko's waking dream
Author:Gabriella
This story is a lemon!!!
Ryoko angrilly rose out of the water, ready to kill
what ever it was that landed on her head! Pushing her
water logged tresses out of her eyes, she felt around
the water and grabbed SOMETHING out.
"Tenchi!" she gasped.
"Ryoko" Tenchi gulped.
Ryoko's cheeks began to warm, this situation was what
she had always dreamed of. She realized her precarious
position, and was suddenly embarassed. "get a grip
Ryoko!" she thought. "How many times have you spyed on
HIM naked, how many times have you whispered sexual
innuendos into his ear?" But she realized, those were
only innuendo's here she was living out the real
thing, her naked, him...in little boxers with smiley
faces.
Ryoko almost laughed, but his sweetness warmed her
heart.
They stared at eachother, Tenchi gazed into her eyes.
They were so beautiful, framed with wet spiky lashes,
they begged not to be hurt by him. Ryoko, trembeled,
she could feel the heat through the water, coming from
Tenchi.
Suddenly Tenchi cupped the side of her face, Ryoko
closed her eyes and snuggled her cheek into the palm
of his hand. Tenchi was overwhelmed by her trust, she
had so little to trust! He knew her life, her
hardships, the cruel things people had done to her.
But here she stood, so innocent-curling into him like
a kitten.
Ryoko opened her eyes and turned her lips to his palm,
paying homage to her love, her little kitten toungue
barely lapped out.
Tenchi pulled his hand back, as if it had been burned.
Ryoko, stung, looked at him in confusion. Her chest
began to heave in emotion, great tears spilling from
eyes that said "please love me Tenchi, thats all I
have ever wanted!"
"Ryoko," he whispered.
Swishing through the water, Tenchi pulled her face to
him and kissed her. Ryoko whimpered, was this
happening? Wrapping her arms around him she returned
his kiss full measure, their mouths and tounges
feeding an unknown need to eachother. Tenchi, wound
his hands into her hair and pulled her head back. He
made love to her neck with his toungue, suckling the
lobe of her ear
Ryoko wrapped her legs around him, and Tenchi walked
to the land and placed her on a bed of falled cherry
petals. Still standing he shook a branch of the tree
and watched as petals rained down on her.
Ryoko layed sprawled, her skin glowing, her legs so
long and soft, begged to be wrapped around and man.
"You are the most beautiful creature I have ever, ever
seen Ryoko!"
"Tenchi..."Ryoko whispered,as she raised her arms in
invitation.
Tenchi lowered himself down to her, cupping one high
full breast, he began to suckle her nipple. Ryoko
closed her eyes in extacy as Tenchi began a path down
her body. Tenchi pulled her thighs apart and lowered
his head, Ryoko bucked and whimpered. His tounge was
magic. It lathed over her nether lips, sucking and
pulling at the little bead of her. Ryoko hands flailed
for something to grab onto, her head tossed wildly and
her thighs began to shake.
"Please Tenchi!" she cried!
Licking her jucies from his lips he smiled down at
Ryoko's passion glazed eyes, her swollen mouth.
"You are now mine Ryoko, mine now and forever."
Ryoko said," I have always been yours Tenchi Masaki."
Grabbing her mouth in a smoldering kiss, Tenchi drove
home. Ryoko was filled with him, wrapping her legs
around him, she began to sway her hips in time to his
gentle thrusts. He pulled out so slowly, almost to the
tip, and then rammed back inside her. Ryoko grabbed at
his shoulder and tossed her head back. Tenchi's
thrusts began to quicken and become more shallow. His
breath panted heavily into her ear as she whispered...
"I love you."
Her orgasam was shattering, the world fallen away from
her, but she was safe in the arms of her Tenchi.

"Ryoko!" Ryoko!!!!" Mihoshi bellowed! Breakfast is
ready!!!! The pounding on the door woke Ryoko. Shakily
sitting up in bed she looked down at her sheets, they
were wet with dreams of Tenchi.
"I...I...I'll be down in a m-minute." Ryoko said.
"Ok!!!" came a chirpy reply.
Ryoko's eyes filled with tears, gathering her legs,
she buried her head into her knees and wrapped her
arms around her shins. "Oh Tenchi," she
whimpered,"will it ever happen?"
