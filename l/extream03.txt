	Well eversince my computer went on the friz. I was unable to send the rest 
of the Extream
Rewrites. I lost such fics as Washus lost love, Tenchi in America2 and the Rest 
of the Rewrite saga.

	So I'm gonna spend my time getting this fic finished as well as the other 
3 chapters.

	Disclaimer: None of these characters belong to me they belong to AIC and 
Pioneer. Don't sue.

				
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Rewrite p.3 Michael's day 
out!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4:56 A.M.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Michael was standing on a glass floor looking around wondering where he 
was.

	"Where am I? What am I doing here?" Michael thought to himself

	Michael started walking across the Glassfloor. He saw something in the 
distance it was all of his friends dead.

	"Tenchi! Sasami! Ayeka! Jason! Who Ever did this is gonna pay the ultimate 
price!" Michael said pissed.

	"HA HA HA HA HA HA!" A shadowy figure said

	"What tha!? My powers their fadeing fast!" Michael yelled

	The shadowy figure formed an energy orb the size of a ballbearing and sent 
it flying into Michael's stomach causing him to 
explode.

	"NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!" Michael yelled

	Across the hall Ayeka hears Michaels scream.

	"Wake up Michael!" Ayeka said shakeing Michael out of his nightmare.

	"My gosh what a terrable dream! I had a dream that everyone was dead and I 
got killed also!" Michael said shakeing.

	"WIll it's okay now." Ayeka said 

	"What day is it?" Michael asked

	"IT's a beautiful Saturday morning." Ayeka answered. 

	"Thanks for bringing me back to reality." Michael said hugging the 
princess makeing the princess blush.

	Michael looked at the princess and started laughing.

	"What are you laughing at?" Ayeka asked

	"It's just the thought that I'm hugging such an important person." Michael 
said

	"Will I'm going to get in the shower now." Michael said walking towards 
the bedroom door.

	Michael was standing in the shower thanking.

	"Ever since I was Demoted my life has been paradise. Maybe this was my 
fate to be on Earth." Michael thought

	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5:15 A.M.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	Everyone was in the Living room watching T.V. waiting for Sasami to finish 
makeing breakfast.

	"So Michael how long have you been a Bounty Hunter?" Mihoshi asked

	"5 Years. I thought I told you that before?" Michael said

	Michael stood still for a second.

	"Michael what's wrong?" Tenchi asked.

	"I sence a very powerful P.L. It's comeing from outerspace.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Outer Space~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Michael you still don't get it do you? I am the most powerful being in 
the universe. You thought you killed me. HA HA HA 
HA HA. You no nothing. As soon as my body regenerates. I will come after you." 
Shockpent said 

	"Maybe I should let my other half get rid of you. POTION PROJECT." 
Shockpent said

	"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!" Shockpent laughed

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Back at the Masaki house.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	"Come here Ryo-ohki! I need to finish drying you off." Sasami yelled

	Michael stood still again!

	"Michael what's gotten into you?" Jason asked

	"It can't be....no It can't be him!" Michael said running outside.

	"Michael!" Everyone said at the same time.

	"Get back inside!" Michael said

	"Shockpent! I know your here come out now!" Michael said pissed.

	"Looks like you found me." Shockpent said

	"EXTREAM TRANSFORMATION!" Michael yelled transforming into Extream version 
4

	"Gattling attack!" Shockpent yelled shooting orbs towards Extream!

	All of the orbs hit Michael sending him through two trees.

	"That's it!" Jason yelled

	"Alpha Unit Transformation!" Jason yelled Transforming into Alpha Unit 3.

	"Another low P.L.?!" Shockpent said laughing 

	"Double Strike!" Shockpent said sending Two lazers towards Jason.

	Two lazers hit Jason sending him towards Extream.

	Michael saw Jason Unconcious.

	"Jason...are you okay." Michael said checking on Jason.

	"Yeah..I'm okay!" Jason replied.

	"Michael this guy is powerful look out!" Ayeka and Sasami said at the same 
time!

	"You two are the princesses Kagato was talking about." Shockpent said 
hovering towards them.

	Shockpent kicked both Sasami and Ayeka causing them to passout.

	"Sasami...Ayeka...Nooooooooo!!!!!" Michael yelled with a tear in his eye.

	"Michael what's happening to you? Your changing!" Jason asked scared.

	"Shockpent look what you've done. You hurt those that were week. Plus you 
hurt a child. I can never forgive you! You..you
Basterd!" Michael said glowing Crimson Red.

	"What's this?!" Washu asked.

	"Oh my god! Michael's P.L. is 5 Billion" Washu said worried.

	"Shockpent! You will die!" Michael said

	"For I'm Bizzaro!" Michael said with a evil voice.

	"I better get out of here!" Jason said flying away.

	"What's happening to Michael?" Ryoko asked.

	"It has begun! Michael has finally reached his limit!" Jason said

	Michael's body started to grow bigger by the minute.

	"WHat tha hell? What have I done?" Shockpent asked himself scared.

	"I gotta get out of here." Shockpent said flying towards outerspace.

	"Not so fast! Pulverizer!" Michael said vinishing!

	Michael appeared infront of Shockpent!

	A 50" Energy orb hit Shockpent sending him flying towards the Earth at 
screaming speeds.

	"Time to finish this!" Michael said

	"Super Godly Heavenly Blast!" Michael said forming a 500 ft. orb

	The orb started heading towards Shockpent!

	The orb swallowed Shockpent and started rising into space as far as it 
could go. Than the orb exploded into a blue explosion! 
Destroying all of Shockpents remains!

	Michael changed back into his normal body and started to fall towards the 
ground!

	Michael hit the gound next to Ayeka.

	"Ayeka the Galaxy is in peace for...ever." Michael said as he passed out.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Washu's 
lab~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"The Princesses and Michael is going to be okay. However it's going to 
take awhile for Michael to regain Consiousnes

	"Michael barely survived by 45 H.P. That's not good." Washu said
	
	"Michael I'm not finished with you. Not by a long shot. Some how you 
managed to make my Power Armor more powerful that the Jurian race." Washu said

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4:00 P.M. Two days 
later.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Michael...Michael wake up." A sweet voice said

	"Where am I? What is this place?" Michael asked
	
	"You are in my Dimension." Tsunami said

	"Why did you bring me here? Oh no I must have died!" Michael said worried.

	"No your not dead yet." Tsunami said 

	"I just decided to invite you to my ship." Tsunami said

	"You see this ship is controlled by Sasami." Tsunami said

	"Sasami. But Sasami is a child." Michael said confused.

	"No I'm one of the Three Goddesses. Please Keep this a secret from 
everyone else." Tsunami said

	"Sure." Michael said

	"Me Washu and Tokimi are Goddesses. And you are a decedent of the Jurai 
Royal Family." Tsunami said

	"WWHATT! But I'm like Tenchi. Part Jurai part Earthling." Michael said
	
	"Let me tell you what really happened that day when Ryoko attacked. Your 
Mother thought that Ryoko was going to destroy planet Jurai. So she sent you to 
Earth.
To grow up. She is dead. She is in Heaven looking down on you happily." Tsunami 
said

	"Can I talk to her?" Michael said

	"You can." Tsunami said

	A middle aged woman stood in front of Michael. 

	"Mother!" Michael said	

	"Son I'm so proud of you. You helped destroy evil. And brought peace to 
the Galaxy. 
I just didn't like it when you turned Bizzaro. You where evil in that form. 
Please don't use that form again.
I love you and always well. Well I'm gone. I gotta get back to playing Bingo. 
But first let me hug you my son." Michaels mother said hugging Michael.

	"Thanks Tsunami." Michael said

	"Mother wait. I need to ask you something?" Michael asked his mother.

	"Yes son." Michael's mother said

	"Do I have a place in Heaven?" Michael asked. 

	".....Yes and so does Jason." Michael's mother said
