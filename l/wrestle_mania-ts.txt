title: WRESTLE MANIA: TENCHI STYLE
________________________________________________________________________

"Hello!! And welcome to United Planetary pSycho's federation or UPS for
short!! I'm....,"
A strange tongue pronounced a foreign word...
"if u can't understand that, im also called 'cock sucker.'"

"And im bloodclaw, one of the hosts of this show, and good to be here
cocksucker!"

The crowd roared with excitement. Signs everywhere were being held up
like 'kick his ass seabass!' or something like that.

    Cocksucker turned his head toward the camera saying, "Good to
have you here!Tonight's fights are going to be great indeed. First match we
have
Tenchi..., hatsuma...,kokato...,and goku!!"

    Tenchi's nose started to bleed  ".......<gulp> why am I doing this?"

Cocksucker continued, " This is a' everybody for himself match' .  Our
second match is a long awaited one.Ayeka, princess of juria, vs. ryoko the
ex-space pirate!!!"

The crowd roared, screamed, and shouted as loud as they could.

    Meanwhile Tenchi quietly prays, still in the back, slaps his
face, "lord help me......I'll pray every night and ask forgiveness too, if
you let me
live....I don't care about the others.... just let me live...PLEASE!!!"

    "And our final fight is between sasami, washu ...vs. kiyone and
mihosi with guest ref.,a mystery ref...... so we'll find out later. Now lets
take it to the
ring with Miss . ....wats her name??"

    "Thanks ,I'm chokeoncum we are with one of the
fighters..hatsuma.....huh?"

with that hatsuma started to go humping crazy on her leg. He moaned, "oh
ryoko....why don't
you understand me....." and started to cry, still humping chokeoncum.

"Oh my god! Get of, of....oooooh.... me!" she started rub his balls.

    The referee yelled, "lets get it..."

"Excuse me.... um can I leave??? I really don't want to die...."

The ref replied, "Sorry son you know the rules!"

Full of rage tenchi grab his sword and swings for his head,
"JESUS, LET ME OUT OF....here....oops!"
 with that the bell rung ,the ref's head rolled out of the ring, and hatsuma
still humping away.

"Man he just killed our referee!! I hope he...."

"Damn it man! it's starting so shut up!" bloodclaw yelled at cocksucker,as
kokato
ran towards hatsuma.

    "You bitch! that's my hoe!" kokato yelled," Get off of her!"

"GGGGGRRRRRRRRRR!!! She's mine!!!" the horney hatsuma contined with the
humping.

And a hard kick to the balls got hatsuma's attention.
"Ugh............"his hands cupped on his balls,"damn.... that's it for
me..."Hatsuma moaned,
and started to puke his brains out.

Kokato grabbed him with one hand ,by the neck, started to beat the living
daylights out of him.

While chokeoncum ran away towards her dressing room, kokato was
enjoying the noises the hatsuma made when his bodily fluids squirt out
of him.

    Meanwhile....Goku...which now he gone crazy from too many
concussions from earlier battles,(for example fighting friza, androids, and
other people or
things)yells,
 "Tenchi how could you...you....wait ....your not Tenchi...
your an android!! NO!!! NOT AGAIN!!" and started to power up.

Poor Tenchi puts his hands in his face.." Oh god....... I wish I got laid
before I died..."

    Goku, charged past the bloody pulp of hatsuma and punched and
kicked Tenchi with super speed.
Tenchi, now with all of his bones broken, lay limp in a corner. Goku, at
point blank,
put his fingers like guns and quoted, "You feel lucky, punk!"

with a huge anime sweat drop he replied,
" Not ...not...really... I just..."
And, Goku, fired the energy blasts. "yyyaaaa!!!"

Tenchi, though now filled with holes fell,"uuuuugggghhhhgh..."

    Meanwhile...kokato continued to beat what was left of hatsuma. Finally
he
dropped him.

"Fool! You thought you could defeat me! Hu?"

Hatsuma jumps into the air saying," YES! Time to DIIIEEEE!!!"

He charged his energy attack, and fired, "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAA hahaahhaahah!!!
Die bastard!"

Kokato smiled as he grabbed the incoming energy balls,"Nice...but not good
enough!!"
And smacked hatsuma into an energy sandwich, "die you poor, Idiotic pimp."
hatsuma instantly died from the blast.

"One down, one to gooooo!! Umf! What in sweet...??!"

Goku latched on to kokato and started to weep..., " I've killed a man!!! How
could I...?
I had a noble heart...how could I.... I can't take it anymore...im going to
kill myself
...bye...bye... I loved the earth so...."

kokato interrupted, " NNNNNNOOOOO!!!!!! NOO! Please no!!"

    Bloodclaw yelled, " Run!!! Get down!!" with that a bright explosion
filled the arena.
The roof started to shake, but that was all. Bloodclaw jumps down to look at
the ring.
The explosiononly killed kokato, the ring had a little bit of ashes, but
Goku
still lived.

" Damn it to Hell! I can't even kill myself!! I give up! " And leaves.

    Bloodclaw yells, " The winner..is....Goku....I think.....oh well I still
think Goku's
a pussy!"

"Well look who he had to fight against..." cocksucker mumbled

"True that!! Anywho...we have a special - between the fight - performance.
It
will
be made by Noboyuki and yosho! They will be performing one of their favorite
hentai scenes."

Bloodclaw mumbled, "man..this is going to be so gay"

Cocksucker replied, "yup"

    Noboyuki stuck his ass up in the air, in the ring. He yelled," Ready,
pops?"

"As I ever will be," yosho calmly replied.

He grabbed his hips, "OOh don't be too hard."

"Hardy har, har. Have I ever been too hard on you?"

Noboyuki thought for awhile," now that I think about it..."

"Nevermind!" yosho yelled as he began to pull down his pants.

    "Oh no! Not this time!" said bloodclaw as he jumped into the ring again,
"No gays
allowed in the stadium or on this planet!!! Go back to hell!!" he pulled out
his sword.

"Isn't that too rash, think before y.....o...uuu...." he was too late,
bloodclaw cut
yosho in half.

"NNONONONONONO!! Don't hurt me! I'm actually an insane person who believes
that he's a woman, so
don't hurt me!"
noboyuki was on his knees, "sorry! " was all bloodclaw could stand before he
stabbed him too,

"Darn,so pretty, so close.......oh well..." was his last words

The crowd yelled in union,"' thank god! That WAS gay!'"
And so the 'clean up crew' began to clean the ring.

                *A few minutes later*

    "Welcome back to UPS and we go straight to the next fight! Between Ryoko
and Ayeka!"

The referee signaled the bell and immediately Ryoko phased out. Ayeka
confused by the move,
turn her head just to meet the fist of Royko. Ayeka fell flat on her face.
She moaned in pain...

Ryoko with a victorious smile laughed, " Tenchi!!! My love, we will be
together
forever as soon as I kill Ayeka!! HAhahahah!"  She yanked Ayeka up and
kneaded her in the gut.

"Oomph!!" she coughed up blood and tried to stand up " You fool, *hack*(more
blood),
don't you know......"
Ryoko yelled, "know what?" Ayeka smirked at her ignorance..

"Lord Tenchi is ....DEAD!!"

Ryoko's eyes flared up,"WHAT? WHAT DID YOU SAY?" Ayeka charges towards
Ryoko,

"You herd me, there's nothing more to fight about, let's end this!!" And
does
her
most powerful punch on Ryoko.

    Bloodclaw mummers," Looks like a deathblow by Ayeka.. ,uh?" In a
unbelievable move, ryoko
grabbed Ayeka's arm and flips her, a amazing countermove.

    "Tenchi, will always live!"

"GET over it!"

Ayeka had enough, she paralyzed ryoko using the 'ryoko trap' washu made for
Ayeka.
"Ha! Now prepare to die!" she unleashes a fury of punches on ryoko.

"uhng!! Stop that Ayeka! It tickles!"

And for a moment, less than a second, the paralyzing rays stopped. Ryoko
sent
an energy blast
that finished off the 'Ryoko trap'. Ayeka flew back from the blast, and
stunned from the
fact that Ryoko destroyed Washu's trap....

"Impossible...no matter...I will destroy you!"

    "Not in this life time! Miss prissy pants, bitch!" And sent a high kick
to Ayeka's head.

Ayeka stumbled but recovered quickly and charged again at Ryoko.

"Prissy bitch, my ass!!"

She gave everything she had on these hard and fast, not to mention furious,
attacks.
Ryoko blocked and dodged a few. Till finally a combo of double punches and a
side
kick sent Ryoko back to the corner, hard.
"Not bad princess, but not good enough!"

"Wait listen to me! There's still no need to fight! Lord Tenchi is DEAD!!"

Ryoko screams, "NOOO! HE'S STILL ALIVE! YOU LIE!"

    Ayeka, doing everything to convince her, continues,
" Well if he's still alive where is he!Hum? Don't know, eh, Ryoko?"
Ryoko eyes started to tear up at the thought of Tenchi's death.

    Ayeka pushed the final button on Ryoko,

"And if you loved him soooo much why didn't you save
him? I thought you really truly loved him. I didn't see you try to rush
the ring. Well I did but the ......."
and she went on and on and on.

    A tear of Ryoko fluttered to the canvas of the ring, she started to
shake, her
eyes turned to blood red, her fangs grew an extra 3 inches long. The anger,
no Rage consumed her.
Electricity formed around her, though Ayeka didn't notice till now, " I
guess
you came to your
senses, now all we...have to.........oh dear......"
by then Ryoko was in the air, gathering as much energy as she could,

Ryoko smirked, " And anyways I must iracicate all the annoying people in the
universe.
Sorry princess! Time to go where you belong. In the grave!
YYYYYYYYYYAAAAAA!"

At First it look like she would fire her energy blast, but instead she kept
on 'powering up'.
    Ayeka stood frozen with huge multiple anime sweat drops on her
forehead."...Oh my..."

Suddenly Ryoko stopped and lifted two fingers straight up, and formed a
baseball sized
energy ball.
"So is that what you want, Ryoko? Fine! I'll have to use my trump card,
LIGHTHAWK WINGS PREPARE
TO FIRE!!" The energy swirled around charging up to fire.

The crowd went wild at the sight of the charging up of powers. "Oh lord.....
tell everybody to
prepare for a huge blast... we need our workers to live or there's no
show!",
as the microphones
caught bloodclaw behind stage, the crowd still continued to scream in
appoval.


    Ayeka, now hovering with Ryoko, finally released the lighthawk wings'
power,

                "LIGHTHAWK WINGS, FIRE!!"

The beam, a light blue, was flying at Ryoko at an incredible speed.

    "Hahahahah! Good bye Ryoko!"

Ryoko waited at the last minute, the baseball-sized ball transformed to a
small moon sized ball.
"YYYYAAA!" And the sphere energy charged towards the light hawk's beam.

Both of the powerful energies where in a stalemate in midair. Slowly the
lighthawk's
beam began to push Ryoko's energy back.

"Hahahahahahahhaha soon Ryoko will feel my wrath! Hahahahahah!"

As soon as ball of energy touched the ground, both them exploded!

    "OH my GOD!!" Bloodclaw couldn't believe it as the two energies
annihilated the ring.

As Ayeka continued to be a cocky cunt , she felt a tap on her shoulder. "No!
It couldn't be!"
She turned her head (like a dumbass), to meet Ryoko with hundreds of energy
balls floating
around her. " Shields up!" she yelled, only to hear the 'error' noise.
"What? Oh no! I've must have used all the energy......" Before she could
finished her sentence,
Ryoko sent the balls of death at Ayeka! "NNNNNNNNNNOOOOO!!"

BOOM! BOOM!! BBBBoooooooooooooooommmmm!!!!

Smoke filled the arena, and a lifeless body fluttered to the ground to only
greet it with a THUD!
Ayeka moaned in pain. Ryoko slowly lowered herself to ' finish her off'.
"Finally Ayeka you will die..... What on earth? " As new energy ball flew
past her and killed
Ayeka. "Hey she was mine!"
 The man yelled back,
"Well since I killed a person in cold blood it doesn't matter that I kill
again!!
I'm now a Bad guy!!!! HAHAhahahahahahah!!!"

"Oh man! It's the pussy boy, Goku! Can I kill him please?!" Bloodclaw
pleaded.

"You know our rules, we can't inter...." but bloodclaw had other ideas.

"I know but I just really hate his guts!!" And bloodclaw grabbed for his
sword.

Meanwhile, Goku and Ryoko where in a middle of punches, kicks, and blocks.
Both where equal in power till Goku jabbed her in the gut.
"Ack! Why you dirty son of a.....oomph!" and got elbowed in the face.
She fell towards the ground trying to recover from the attack.
Too bad Goku fired his spirit bomb at her!

" What the hell?" and was overcome by the blast. All was left was her ashes.

"The one thing I hate more than anything is jackasses like you!!!" And with
a
single
swing from behind, Goku's head was lobbed off.
The cut was clean, and the crowd went wild. Blooclaw smirked, and put
the sword in the sheath with the blood still covering the sword.

" What a fight! Just wait for the third and final; with no
interruptions...hopefully, match.
Washu and sasami Vs. kiyone and mihosi and our mystery referee! It's
sakuya!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------

                    * Few minutes later*

" What that brat?!" Washu exclaimed

"Yup! It's that slut that wants Tenchi real bad! But isn't Tenchi dead? "
Sasami explained.

"Yes, but you know....!!! I know, I've got an idea!" as the two mini washus
appeared giveing
her prasie ,

" You're the greatest!"

"Thank god she's easily asmused." sasami said as she and the others
went towards the middle of the ring.

Sakuya, as usall was thinking of Tenchi, when Washu interruped her daydream
,
" Umm.. before we start. I would like to give you something"
She wipped out a ordiary looking dildo. She wispered, "It's Tenchi's size."

"I though it would be ... well bigger." Sakuya frowned at the sight.

"Don't worry just go enjoy yourself... faraway, very far away."

"ok!" She giggled and ran away

"um...Washu what did you do this time?" Sasami gave a confused look.

"Simple! Everytime she sticks it in her, millions of spikes pop out to tear
apart her vigaina.
She will never enjoy cilmaxes ,never ever again!That stuiped slut,
HAhahahaha!"
Washu smiled to her self as the the mini washu's appeared again.
" You're the greatest! No one can touch you!"

The bell rung and Kiyone charged towards Washu, "No one, huh?" and punched
her all the way out of the ring.

"I'm tired of you being the smart ass!", Mihosi interrupted," but she is the
smartest..."

"shut up Mihosi!" and gave her a swift side kick.

"I'm sorry! I won't ever do anything bad again."

"Well ok. Next time I'll won't be so easy to ya."

Mihosi jumped with joy," Yea! Yup!"

Sasami charged at mihosi," You stupid hoe!" and let loose a fury of punches
and jabbes.

"oowie!"

"shut up! get over it!" and continued to beatup mihosi.

Then the loudest noise came over the ring," RRREEEOOOOWWW!!"

"What the hell?"
" Hey Kiyone, is that Rho-oike?"
" I don't think so... it looks like a human figure."
Washu exclaimed," Yes! It's Sakuya! Thank Ya Jesus!!"
Kiyone shook her head," For once I agree! Amen!"
The lifeless Sakuya swiftly fell on the ground with a thud, to only hear the
noise again.

"RRRREEOOWW!"

Suddenly Washu exclaimed," Oh my god! Look! It IS Rho-oike!"
Rho-oike transfromed into the huge robot/mech looking form, she came
crashing
down from
the ceiling.

"RRRRRRRRRREEEEOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!"

"Umm... Bloodclaw what the hell is that?" cocksucker asked.
"That's Rho-okie, a cabbit ... wait, what the hell? There seems to be
something
stuck up her ass!"

"REEEERRREEEOOOWWW!!!"

"Hey is that a dildo? Washu, is it?"
"WHAT?!" She started to blush, "I don't know what your talking about,
Kiyone."

"Oh... I see it's the one you gave to little miss slut. Wait, Why is it up
Rho-okie's..."

Then it hit her.

"EEEWWW!! That sick bitch! That horney little...UGH!! Why I ought..."



                    SPLAT!!

With a quick drop hand Rho-okie freckin squished her... really, inhumanly
flat.
"RHO-OKIE! NOO! Kiyone!! <sniff...sniff>Why Rho-okie WHY? WAAAAAAAAA!"
For the first time, Rho-okie spoke!

"Shut your hole, and know your role! Now beat it!" and kicked her into orbit
where she died
of colliding space junk.

"Wow a cabbit that talks! I must study her more! Amazing!!"

"Your not studying anything anymore you freak!" and chopped washu in half
and
fired her eye
lasers at the rest of her remands.

"Rho-okie its me sasami, your best friend!"

Rho-okie turns towards sasami, her eyes gleaming red.

"Sasami, you! All these years all I wanted was a freckin carrot! But no, you
have
to use them in those god-awful food, that you cooked for those ingrates!
With the help of tenchi, by growing those carrot patches I have learned the
fine art
of carrot growing! I do not need you any more. Now I can have...REEEOOOWW!!"

A gargle came from deep from Rho-ioke's belly. She turns her back towards
samami, and
grabbed her stomach in pain,
"Roew! Roew! What...?! What's going on...!? ROEW!"

FFFART!

Rho-oike let the biggest one go! It was Bigger than anybody has ever let go.
It stunk, really bad. In fact there was a haze over the arena.
Once the haze cleared, samasi stood firm in the ring.
Even though see had a dildo stuck in her chest.

"Well, bloodclaw, that thing that was stuck up her ass is gone...but now
it's
in sasami.
EWW! And you know where it's been!"

While cocksucker and bloodclaw try to find him a doggy bag, sasami uses all
her might to pull out the dildo, while Rho-oike turns towards sasami.

"Fine you won't listen to me," pulls out the dildo, " Take this!"
And throws it with all her might.

"That was quite desperate, wasn't it." Rho-oike commented, " Oh well,"
And, with her lasers, shot it in midair.
It burned to a million pieces. "Now it your turn! Die!"
Rho-okie arms turned into gun barrels and she started to fire! "Hahahahah!"
Sasami though small was very agile and could run like crazy to dodge the
bullets.

"Oh ...*huff*...god...*puff* ...somebody help...*huff puff*"

"No one is here to help you now! HAhahah!"
All of a sudden a robotic voice came from the broken pieces.

"THE PRODUCT MODEL 1457-69 HAS BEEN BROKEN OR HAS RAN OUT OF POWER.
THE NUCLEAR FUSION CORE IS USTABLE. PLEASE EVACTUATE UP TO 3 MILES FOR
MINIUM
SAFTEY RANGE.
YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS, 9...8...7... "

"...?!?!  Wa?"

"Well, sasami, time to say good bye. I must be going." and transformed into
the
spaceship version of herself. "Reow!" and took off at top speed.

" 5... 4...2.."

"Hey what happened to 3?"

"SORRY JUST KIDDING, 3...2"

"Well I'm bloodclaw saying good..."

BOOOOMMM!
