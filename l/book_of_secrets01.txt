Book of Secrets: Chapter 1

Entry 1.  6:00 PM
If I knew what to write in here I would.. but I don't. So I'm just going
to leave you here with this message. I am lost. I don't know what to do. I
must choose between the 2 most beautiful women in the entire planet and I
can't. I love both of them. I want both of them. Ryouko, Aeka.. I love you
both. I can't choose. I can't. I just want them both so that everyone can be

happy. I wouldn't be able to stand the site of either of them being sad and
miserable because of me.. because I did not choose her. I spent today
looking
into cheerful crimson eyes. How I wish I could stare into them forever. Her
smooth, silk skin brushed against mine as I held her close to me, her head
resting peacefully against my chest as I whispered deep, romatic thoughts
into her ear. Her soft giggles echoed through my ears and that was all  she
had to do to make me smile. To see her happy.
I wish today could have lasted forever, but it didn't... obviously. The
kiss that ended the day seemed like only a split second to me. Her tongue,
exploring every inch of my mouth and mine fencing with hers.. playing
around.
Aeka, my sweet Juraian Princess. How pure and innocent you are.. how I wish
I
could take that away from yuu. To enter the depths of your inner self and
fill you with pure ecstasy. Aeka.. I say your name again... Let me love you,

let me enter your sweet treasure chest.. share your gold with me.

A knock on the door disturbed the young man and he quickly finished up
his entry. A young voice then followed the knock.
"Tenchi? Lord Tenchi? Supper is ready."
"I'll be right there!" he called back to her.

You call for me my sweet princess. I will return tomorrow, but as I lay
quietly asleep in bed tonight... I will dream of you. I will dream of you,
of
me, finally together in each other's arms. Soundlessly asleep in each
other's
arms. Good night my sweet princess. I will see you soon.

He closed his journal and opened up the top drawer to his little desk,
slipping the notebook into a secret compartment so no one would be able to
find it. A soft yawn was heard from him as he raised his arms in the air and

stretched before walking out of his bedroom and downstairs to the dining
room
where he would have supper with Aeka, Ryouko, and the rest of the gang.
He arrived at the table and sat down next to Ryouko and across from Aeka
who smiled at him sweetly. The dinner smelt wonderful and he was starving.
Everyone ate their share of the meal and spoke of their day, the usual
things
a family would do.
"This is great, Sasami," he complimented the young chef.
"Thank you, Tenchi! I'm glad you like it!" she smiled and went back to
eating.

Supper was done in minutes and everyone left the table to do their own
thing. Tenchi decided to head to his room and get some shut eye since he had

a lot of work to do. Another yawn could be herad from him and he stepped
into
his room.
"That was a great meal," he said to himself as she fell back onto his
back and stared up at the ceiling.
While Tenchi went off into a daydream, Ryouko phased through the wall and
smiled, she was up to something again. She quietly hovered over to Tenchi
and
looked down at him, her yellow cat-like eyes peering down at his body,
eyeing
every single part of him.
"Tenchiiiiii," she whispered softly as she layed down next to him,
wrapping her arms around him. "Tenchiii."
He snapped out of his daydream and looked at Ryouko as a slight blush
appeared on his cheeks. "R-Ryouko... what are yuu doing?"
"Hmm." She giggled softly and ran her hand along his chest as she brought
her lips up to his ear and whispered, "I want you, Tenchi."
Tenchi started to get a little nervous and a sweat drop formed on the
side of his head. He didn't know what to say to her so he remained silent as

Ryouko began to feel him all over. She licked her lips as she pulled his
pants down, along with his white boxers, exposing him. Ryouko swirled her
tongue around the tip of his dick and Tenchi let out a gasp.
"So you like that?" She took him into her mouth and began to suck on him,
swirling her tongue over the tip once in a while, before taking him in
again.
Tenchi moaned out in pleasure, he had never felt anything so good and he was

sure to explode any second, but before he did, Ryouko stopped and crawled on

top of him, leaving Tenchi at the edge.
She slowly took her clothes off, teasing Tenchi a little. Soft giggles
could be heard from her as she pulled Tenchi's shirt off. Tenchi, not sure
of
what to do, just stared at Ryouko's breast as his eyes made her way down to
her crotch. Ryouko leaned into him and kissed him, slipping her tongue under

his and letting it roam around and explore his mouth. Tenchi broke the kiss
and kissed her neck softly then made his way down to one of her breast. He
took it into his mouth and began to suck on it as he grabbed her other one
and began to rub it, making Ryouko moan in pleasure.
Ryouko laid back onto the bed and spread her legs as Tenchi began to lick
her, sliding his tongue and and out of her, making circling swirling motions

which made Ryouko moan out again. He continued to lick her and Ryouko soon
reached her climax, releasing all of her juices onto Tenchi's face and all
over her inner thigh. He cleaned her off then crawled onto her, kissing
Ryouko passionately.
Tenchi rubbed the tip of his dick against Ryouko's wet pussy lips before
sliding all the way into her. Ryouko let out a soft, low moan as Tenchi
began
to slide in and out of her, slowly at first. He began to increase his speed
every minute, going into her harder each time. Ryouko's hands grabbed the
bed
sheets as she tilted her head back a little and moaned, wanting him to go
faster and harder.
"Tenchiiiiiiii, ahhhhhh, Tenchiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii."
Seeing Ryouko, he sped up and went harder, close to pounding into her
pussy.
Reaching her climax, she tightened her grip on the bed sheets, almost
pulling them off of the bed as she arched her back and moaned out Tenchi's
name once again. Tenchi shot his hot cum into her a short while after,
decreasing his pace then finally coming to a stop. He collapsed onto Ryouko
and she kissed him.
"I love you, Tenchi."
"I love you too, Ryouko.."
He held Ryouko in his arms as they both slowly drifted off to sleep.

Entry 2. 1:00 am
I cannot sleep. I just had the most incredible night with Ryouko. She
came into my room after supper and filled me with unbearable pleasure. It
was
just so wonderful! I've never felt anything like it before and Ryouko, ah
yes, Ryouko. My beautiful space pirate. How I wish I could make you happy
and
fill you with pleasure again. You lie in my bed sleeping peacefully. A demon

that has the face and body of an angel is what you are, so beautiful. How I
want to feel that angelic body against mines once again.

He looked over to Ryouko and smiled, quietly tapping the tip of his pen
against his notebook as a soft sigh escaped his lips.

I need to get some sleep. I have lots of chores to do tomorrow, but
before I go, I must say this. I love you Ryouko, with all my heart and
Aeka..
I love you too. Choosing between you two gets harder every single day. The
look in your eyes, the feel of your skin... I love it, but I know that I
must
choose between the two of you one day... just not now. Not now, my angels.
Not now....
