     I don't own Tenchi or anything for that matter.  This is a freak 
fic, so put the kids to bed.
     And now on to that show. . .
.............

". . . And the Crowd Goes Mild"

     As the story begins Tenchi and Aeka are in the forrest near the 
Masaki home. The sun is shining, the birds are singing a Papa Roach tune,
and the two are boinking in the woods. 
     Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Boink Doing
     Ayeka got tired and sat down on a big rock, "Why on Earth did Miss 
Washyuu ever invent these"? 
     "I guess", Tenchi was looking at the spring loaded shoe labled 
"Boink-o-Matic", on his left foot, "She thought they would be fun. 
     "She was wrong"!
     "Yep!" 
     "I know", said Ayeka. Ayeka and Tenchi were taking off their 
'Boink-o-Matic' shoes when they heard the sounds of a sword fight in 
progress. Now bare foot, they went to investigate these noises. 
     Tenchi and Ayeka reached the clearing Justin time to see Connor 
Mcloud cutting the head off of some poor jerk.  He stuck his sword in, 
then pulled it out, then stuck it in again then pulled it out again.
I tak e whiskey drink, I take a choclate drink, and when I have to pee,
I use the kitchen sink!  Electricity started flying everywhere.  When 
things calmed down Tenchi said, "Hey, who the fuck are you"? 
"My name is Connor Mcloud of the Clan Mcloud. You wanna make something 
of it"! 
     "What the hell", Tenchi thought, "I haven't killed any thing in 
weeks"! 
     "Yeah", he said, "I wanna make something of it!", then he pulled out
his sword hilt and formed the blue energy blade. And quickly dispatches 
the 'Highlander'. 
     "Oh wow", says Ayeka, then changes into cabbit form and snuggles to 
Tenchi's leg. 
     Mihoshi walks up, grabs Ayeka by the neck and swollows her whole. 
Tenchi smiles, and whispers in her ear, "Seeing you kill stuff makes my 
cock hard", an his pants exploded, "See"!  Tenchi and Mihoshi were 
walking back to his room as they passed Ryoko playing the drums, Washu 
playing the bass guitar, And Joe Merchant playing his Statocaster 
(hope I spelled it right). 
"Good morning Techi-sama", Washu says. Tenchi replies, "No! I'm Tenchi 
Pansaroff"! 
"Whatever", said Washu, "I don't worry about such details I'm the 
greatest, most brilliant, and CUTEST bassplayer in the universe"! 
     Ryoko said, "Hey Tenchi, are you going to fuck Mihoshi"? 
     "Yes I am Ryoko, would you like to watch"? 
     "HELL YES!", Screamed Joe Merchant.
     As Tenchi and Mihoshi start to bone, Joe and the girls play some 
sentual mood music.
     "GET UP, COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
     oPEN UP YOUR HATE AND AND LET IT FLOW INTO ME
     GET UP, COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
YOU MOTHER GET UP COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
YOU FUCKER GET UP COME ON GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
MADNESS IS THE GIFT THAT HAS BEEN GIVE TO ME!"
    Tenchi leaned Mihoshi back on the grand piano, stuck his big 
beefy balogna into her, and proceeded to fuck the stuffing out of her. 
Untill he reached his peak and sprayed his egg nog into her.  And she 
turned into cranberry jelly under his awesome , um, give me a sec, oh 
yeah, turkey leg!  And she dumped her lady gravy down his regular legs.
     This got Washu and Ryoko so very aroused that they sandwiched Joe, 
stripped him naked, and took turns sucking his candy cane.  I just 
stuffed a cucumber up your butt.  Aren't Food referances fun?
     Sasami walked up to the writer of the fic with an angry look on her 
face. 
Mst crew member(as Sasami): How dare you write this! 
"How dare you write this 
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
 and not give me someone to fuck"! 
     The writer of the fic then starts typing, after a few minutes 
Gohan comes up behind and blasts her from behind.   Then when Sooper
Saiyan on her ass. Sasami began moaning, "Oooh Yeah! Wait, wrong hole! 
Yeah! There it is! There it is! There it is!! Ooooh Yeah! GO-GO-GOHAN!
YOU'RE MY HEERO!! Come with me ON MY JOURNEY INTO HELL!!! DA-DADA-DAT-
DADA!!! SUPER SAIYAN!!!!!  GET DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS!!!!!!!!", with 
that the young warrior's wiener went off like a fire hydrant, propelling
Sasami twenty feet in the air. 
     Just then the 'Hemisphere Dancer' lands in the lake and out jumps
Team Rocket.  Jesse yells, "Go Lickitung!", Lickitung sticks it's head 
under her mini skirt and Jesse falls moaning with pleasure.  James 
yelled, "Go Weezing", and his poke'mon came out and died of lung cancer,
taking this fic with it.
