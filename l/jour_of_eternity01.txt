It is a moonless, starless night at the Masaki household, all is still
and everyone is sleeping.  A dark, shadowy figure is then seen in
the sky.  The figure flys to the Masaki house and lands at the front
door.  The figure is seen as a young woman looking Ryoko's age. 
Her hair is shadowy black and she has green, menacing eyes.  She
wears a long, black velvet dress, cut close to her breasts,
reaveiling a little of her tan skin.  She carries a large sack, she
then "shimmers" as if she was a shadow and walks through the
wall.  The woman creeps along the floor looking for her victum,
Tenchi.  She walks up the stairs to Tenchi's room and stars at him.
Tenchi then wakes up to see a beautiful, but evil space woman
standing over him 
 
Tenchi:Who are...
 
The woman covers his mouth and stuffs him in the sack, she then
tries to sneak away but steps through a green lazer sensor,
sounding an alarm.  At that moment Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami and
Washu show up.
 
Ayeka: You put Lord Tenchi down this instant you...you... hey who
are you anyway!
 
Ryoko: Yeah, state your name or i'll just have to force it outta
you!
 
Woman: Ooh, I'm shaking in my jetboots, like you could hurt me!
 
Sasami: You make me really mad lady, so hand over Tenchi or... or,
I'm gonna have to hurt you!
 
Woman: Not that It'll help you, but i am Dianea, and not only that,
but I'm going.  See ya!!!
 
Dianea flies off forgetting to shimmer and she breaks a hole in the
roof, she disapeers from beyond the farthest star.
 
Ryoko and Ayeka: Tenchi!
 
Sasami: Oh no Tenchi's gone, and we don't know where to!
 
Washu: Oh girls, I think i can help this little problem.  Follow me to
my laboratory. 
 
All of the girls follow Washu to a gigantic computer.
 
Washu: Find all data availiable on Dianea.
 
The computer screen flashes with colored squares, soon reveiling a
picture of Dianea and a discription.
 
Ayeka:(Reading from the screen) Dianea is a wanted criminal, with
little known about her.  She has been seen flying form various
planets to section 4356 of the Cinton galaxie, the outer
regions. (looks confused) Washu, what does this mean!
 
Washu: Well the computer shows that she is seen flying around
section 4356 better known as the small planet of Tarades.
 
At that moment Ryoko freezes, everyone can sense that she
knows something.
 
Sasami: Ryoko, what do you know about this planet?  Ryoko, tell
us, they took Tenchi!
 
Ryoko: Well, um you see, way back when I was partners with the
ruler of that planet.  Her name was Hecate.  She was better known
as the Mistress of Shadows, and by men the Mistress of Lust.
 
Ayeka: And this...lustful shadow woman has Lord Tenchi.  Who
knows what she could to to him...or worse with him!  Washu, we
have to get him back.
 
Washu: Well Ayeka, we do have a ship...Reoh-ohke, and Ryoko can
be our guide, map, guru...whatever, she can help us find the way.
 
All Girls: Lets go!
 
    ~*~*~*Meanwhile on planet Tarades With Tenchi*~*~*~
                             
Dianea has just arrived with Tenchi still in the sack.  She lands just
before a big black palace.  At her command the two doors open
and she walks down the hall to the royal chamber.
 
Dianea:(talking to Tenchi in the sack) Hecate is going to be so
pleased with me when I bring her you.  Imagine, a real Jurai prince.
 
Dianea reaches the royal chambers, she stares up onto a throne. 
Upon the throne sits a tall, slender, shapley woman.  She is
wearing a black boustea (strapless bra) with a gold jewel
connecting the two sides.  She also wears a long black wrap-skirt
with a golden roping belt.  Her hair is jetblack nad she has cold,
blue eyes and pale milky-white skin.
 
Dianea: Hello your highness, my rule Hecate.  I have for you a gift,
a man.  He's not like the others, he's a native Jurain Prince, raised
on Earth!  
 
Hecate: Well then, I'll just have to try him out.  Let him out of the
sack Dianea, then stand back.
 
Dianea unties the sack and lets Tenchi out.
 
Tenchi: Why am I here, who are you.
 
Hecate: I'm Hecate the ruler of this planet.  It's called Tarades
otherwise known as the Shadow planet.  And you are here for me
to enjoy.
 
Tenchi: Oh no, I will not lay with you.
 
Hecate: Well, then I'll just force you, I've done it before.  Dianea
take him to my bed chamber, I'll be in soon.
