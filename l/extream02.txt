	"Okay Kagatos ship is just 500 space Miles away from us." Michael said

	"So Zedd it looks like Were going to have to battle again. This time I 
won't let you live. Make the last moments of your life count Zedd." Michael 
thought 

	"Well there it is the Soja 2. Man it looks so much bigger than the one 
that I saw on the news 5 years ago. Michael thought amazed 

	"There's something about Michael that I just can't figure out." Ayeka 
thought while looking at the stars.

	"Okay everyone there is a secret compartment on this ship that is also an 
escape vessel if I don't  come back activate these escape pods they'll transport 
you back to G.P. head quarters this is the only thing that I could thank of in 
case I fail. The escape pods is on the second door on the right activate them 
with the key code. Here is the code 4-3-5-7 got that Mihoshi!" Michael said to 
everyone.

	"Tenchi are you sure that you want to go through with this?" Michael asked 

	"Yes I've dealt with Kagato before. And I can beat him again?" Tenchi said

	"Okay but  he did train Zedd and Pashint to be more powerful than me." 
Michael said while walking back to the cockpit area of the Excaliber MM.

	"Maybe I'll just call this one off." Tenchi said sitting back down with 
the girls.

	Then Something happened the Soja 2 started fireing at the Excalliber MM. 

	"Here we go! I'm going to try to hit the Outside entrance so I can have a 
better way to get inside." Michael said

	"Computer give me a full visual of the Soja 2!" Michael said commanding 
the computer.

	"There is no information our visuals for the Soja 2!" The computer 
explained to Michael.

	"Fine I'm going to damge his ship so you have a chance to escape!" Michael 
said


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Soja2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"There's the Excaliber MM Our the Excaliber Millenium. Activate weapon 
destabelizers! Point the Weapon destabilizer at the Excaliber MM now! FIRE!!" 
Kagato said giveing the Soja 2 the command to Disable the Excaliber MM!

	"Direct hit the Excaliber MM's Weaponry cannot fire back." The computer 
said

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Excaliber MM~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Oh no I was too late. Just Take the the rest back to earth! But first 
Transport me to the Soja 2." Michael said

	"Extream transformation!" Michael said transforming into Extream V.3

	"Kagato it's my turn to teach you not to mess with the Earth!" Extream 
said pissed!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The entrance to the Soja 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	"Computer have you left yet?!" Michael asked his computer!

	"Yes The masaki family was sent home." The wrist watch said.

	"Geeze I hope that Jason gets here. I'm stuck with no ride." Michael 
thought

	"Let's see all paths lead to him so I'm going to chose this path." Michael 
Thought

	Michael started flying through the Corrdors of the Soja2 Until he saw a 
familure figure.

	"I'm your first opponent Michael ready to get your ass kicked?!" Pashint 
said powering up.

	"Oh by the way Extream in order to get to me you got to destroy three of 
my minions Pashint,Zedd and a secret fighter that I just Revived I hope that I 
get to spill your blood all over the ground." Kagato said while in his holograph 
form.

	"Let me start first by saying that I got a secret weapon that I'm about to 
use!" Michael said while powering up to Super Extream.

	"Oh realy? What is this secret weapon of yours im interested in that. 
Pashint said 

	"YOu asked for it! Hyper Extream mode!!!" Michael said 
	
	"Platinum energy started glowing around Extreams body makeing the ship 
shake.

	"NO WAY YOU CAN'T BE THAT POWERFUL IT'S IMPOSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!" Pashint 
said scared

	"Your power level is 60,000,000 and mines only 50,000,000" Pasint said 
while scanning his P.L.

	"Prepare to meet your demise." Michael said

	Michael started punching and kicking Pashint at radical speeds.

	"Oh no my power level is now 60,000 Aghhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!" Pashint said

	"I call on Sword Justice!!!!!" Michael said

	"Please have pity on me?!" Pashint asked groveling at Michael's feet.

	"I'm sorry but I don't forgive evil!" Michael said

	And just as he finished talking. Michael chopped off pashints head makeing 
blood squirt everywhere.

	"No Pashint! He can't be dead that quickly?" Zedd thought in disbelief.

	"Zedd your next!" Kagato said

	"No I don't want to go! I'll get killed! Extream has a bigger power level 
than me!" Zedd said walking backwards to the door.

	"Suit yourself." Kagato said holding his hand up pointing it towards Zedd.

	"What are you doing? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Zedd said Screaming.

	Kagato shot a power ball straight through Zedds Stomach making him 
explode.

	"What a waist. Two of my Minions destroyed. 

	"I'll send out the Dragos King." Kagato said

	"Come fourth Dragos!" Kagato yelled.
	
	A man with white hair and a dragon staff appeared before Kagato.

	"Destroy Extream please.Remember when he killed your wife don't you want 
revenge?" Kagato asked the king.

	"Yes and who's that in the container over there?" Dragos asked
	
	"That would be the most deadliest being Heavenshockpent. He's the last 
challenger for Extream to challenge before he can go against me!

	"Well who's my next enemy to fight?"Extream thought 

	He finnaly got to the next chamber. 

	"I'm waiting Kagato!" Extream said frustraited and bored.

	"Remember me you killed my wife now I'm going to kill you!!" Dragos said.

	"Holy shit! It's Dragos the king of Dragons!" Extream said shocked and 
confused.

	"Ha Ha Ha the great Kagato destroyed Zedd. Then he summoned me to get you 
know I finaly get my revenge!!!!" Dragos said holding and pointing his dragon 
Staff at his self!

	"Dragos transformation!!!" Dragos said transforming into a giant dragon!

	"Damn he's bigger than his wife was!" Extream thought 	

	Dragos started charging up a energy blast the size of a basket ball goal! 

	"Shield Infanity!" Extream yelled summoning the golden shield. 

	Dragos's energy ball started flying towards Extream!

	The ball hit Extreams shield makeing Extream fly 10 Ft. away from Dragos!

	"My god that was close. I got to be....." Extream thought before Dragos 
hit him in the side with his tail.

	Extream flew 20 ft. hitting the side of the corridor makeing a body print.

	"Damn my powers are fadeing." im now 60,000,000." Extream thought looking 
at his power level.

	Dragos transformed back into his first form! 

	"HA HA HA HA! I'm just too powerful for you Extream" Dragos said.

	"That's it you really pissed me off!!" Extream said yelleing. 

	This time a rainbow like energy was emulating off of Extreams body!

	"Nooooooooo!!!! whered he get that kind of energy!!!!!" Dragos said 
scared!

	"This is my angel form!!!" Extream said

	2 sets of wings appeared on Extreams back!

	"I call on Sword Omega!!!!!" Angel Extream said!

	"NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! you'll blow us all up!" Dragos said.

	"What tha hell is that?!!!!!" Kagato thought!

	"No one can Emulate that kind of power he's more powerful than Tsunami!" 
Kagato thought scared.

	"I may be able to use him!" Kagato thought.

	"What is going on? That power is incredible!!!" Jason thought

	"That must be were Michael is!" Jason thought speeding towards the energy 
flow!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Soja 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Tsunamis theme plays!

	"You will not survive this!" Angel Extream said!

	Michael started useing both his hands forming two swords.  Sword Justice 
and  the other Sword Omega!

	"No way that's impossible his powerlevel is 1billion and still going!" 
Kagato screamed!

	Extream took his helmet off and threw it towards the ground!

	Michaels eyes glown blue even his pits were blue!

	Michael held up both swords and they formed into the ultimate sword. Sword 
Avanger!

	Michael started to run towards Dragos cutting him in half!

	"I can't beleave that I the Dragon king is dead!" Dragos said before 
splitting in two and exploding!

	Michael started decreasing his power to V.4 again.

	"Wow that's the first time that I wen't angel form!" Extream thought

	Michael finaly made it to Kagatos Main Chambers only to find Kagato 
playing the Organ

	"Welcome to my chamber had fun." Kagato said.

	"Well let's see? Yeah I had fun killing two of the most powerful life 
forms."Extream said 

	"Well things our about to get even more better." Kagato said laughing 
evily!

	"What are you up to? Is there one more that I have to kill?!" Michael said

	"Well of coarse he's hovering over us right now." Kagato said looking up.

	"What tha hell there's nothing up there." Michael said looking for the 
other fighter.

	"You fool never trust a space pirate!!!" Kagato said punching Extream in 
the stomach.

	"UGHHHH damn that was a powerful punch!" Extream said feeling his stomach!

	Kagato summoned his sword and started to fly towards Extream.

	Kaching Kaching!

	"Aghhhhhhh!" Kagato yelled 

	"My shoulders!" Kagato yelled!

	"That we'll teach you not to mess with my friend!" The man said!

	"Jason is that you?" Michael asked the man!

	"Yes looks like you could use some help!" Jason said!

	"Alpha Transformation!" Jason yelled turning into Alpha unit!
	
	"NOOOOOOO!!!!!! Not two freaks This can't be happening to me!" Kagato said 
trying to get up.

	Kagato ran to towards HEavenshockpents Capsule!

	"Ha let's see you survive the ultimate being Heavenshockpent!" Kagato 
said!

	"No not him not Heavenshockpent!" Jason said scared!

	The Capsule started opening up and reveiling a 7Ft. clown with Red Hair 
Black Eyes and yellow baggy pant's		

	"Heavenshockpent take care of Extream!" Kagato said

	"No I refuse to be controlled by a weak P.L.!" Heavenshockpent said!

	"How dare you defy me I summoned you!" Kagato said

	"I'm not going to do it!" Heavenshockpent said

	"Fine than take this!" Kagato said chargeing up an energy blast 

	Heavenshockpent evaded the attack!

	"You made me mad now I'm going to destroy you!" Heavenshockpent said!

	"No you wouldnt!" Kagato said.

	Heavenshockpent started chargeing up an energy blast the size of a 
ballbering.
	
	The energy ball wen't into Kagatos stomach and Heavenshockpent closed his 
hand makeing Kagato Explode!

	The only thing that was left of Kagato was his glasses!

	"Aghhhh no way Kagatos power level is gone!" Jason And Michael said at the 
same time!

	"I thank I'll take care of you Jason!" Heavenshockpent said.

	"No you won't!" Michael said pissed

	"You invaded my dreams and haunted me for way too long now it's time to 
send you back were you came from!" Michael said chargeing up to Angel Mode!

	"I can play that to!" Heavenshockpent said chargeing up!

	"What four wings?! No way and their black!" Michael said

	Heavenshockpent started flying towards Michael!

	They both started punhing and kicking each other in an awesome speed!

	They stoped than started back up again!

	"WHat tha hell? Why doe's Michael have wings!" Jason thought!

	"It's time to end this Super angel spirit attack!" Extream Yelled!

	In an awesome flash Heavenshockpent was sliced in half!

	"Ha remember I got tha power to recreate my body!" Heavenshockpent said 
growning his lower half back!

	"Take this! Heavenhockpent ray!" Heavenshockpent said releasing a line of 
energy straight to Michael.

	"NOOOO!!!!!! Jason!" Michael said!

	"Please we need to combine both of our powers!" Jason said trying to get

	Michson started holding his hands up in the air forming the Holy Blast!

	"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" HEavenshockpent yelled 

	"Holy Blast come fourth destroy the Evil Demon known as Heavenshockpent!" 
Michson said!

	The Soja2 was completely submerged into a bright ball of Energy and the 
Soja 2 exploded!

	The only thing that was left was Michson in a Oxygen orb!

	"There's Jasons ship better head towards it before the Oxygen orb 
vanishes!" Michson said

	"Okay but im hurt pretty badly and I'm starving!" Jason said

	"Man That was a Long battle you should have been there!" Michael told 
Jason!

	"I'll get you fixed up in a jeff!" Michael said 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Back on 
Earth!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"So I wonder if Michael defeated kagato!" Tenchi wondered!

	I can't detect Kagato." Ryoko said
 
	"Than he actually destroyed Kagato and those other 2 monsters." Washu said 
Happily

	"What is that sound?!" Ayeka asked

	"It sounds like a ship and it's getting awfully loud!" Tenchi said

	Everyone herd a loud crash!

	"Michael that ship coasted me 100,000 Jerai!" Jason yelled

	"Oops sorry about that remember the Earth don't have a Beacon!" Michael 
said

	"We'll ready to walk?" Michael asked Jason

	"I guess. I hope I can fit in being from the planet Alpha." Jason said

	"You'll fit in just fine you look like your from Earth." Michael said
	
	"Yahoo Michael over here!" Ryoko said waveing at Michael

	"This would be my partner Jason." Michael said

	"Nice to meet you Ryoko." Jason said

	"How do you know my....oh yeah that's right you tried to arrest me once so 
I forgot!" Ryoko said

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Later at the Masaki 
house~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Thanks for the Dinner and thanks for takeing care of Jasons wounds." 
Michael said

	"Your welcome. Tell me something why did it take so long to battle 
kagato?" Washu and Sasami asked.

	"It took you three days!" Tenchi said

	"Three days! Holy shit! I forgot that when your in space times goes by 
like the wind!" Michael said

	"Well there were more than Kagato,Zedd and pashint." Michael said Laughing 

	"Really who else were there?" Ryoko asked.

	"Well there were The Dragon King Dragos and Heavenshocpent the evil Demon 
Clown." Michael said

	"Holy cow what was there power Levels?" Tenchi asked.

	"Dragos was a level 100,000,000. Heavenshockpent was at level 2 Billion. 
Kagato was killed by Heavenshockpent cause no one can control him under a low 
P.L. which his was 2.5 Billion. It took me and Jason to kill him." Michael said

	"We had to fuse in order to kill him." Michael said

	Everyones mouths were on the floor.

	"And your power levels?" Washu asked

	"Well when I hit Super Extream V.1. It's at level 600,000. When I hit V.2  
it shoots up to 650,000. V.3. When I hit V.4 it's really high its at 
600,000,000. When I hit Angel mode our V.5. 1.5 Billion. And if me and Jason 
fuse it's at 4.5 Billion." Michael said

	Now Katsuhitos mouth is on the floor.

	"There's no way a human could contain that much power! It's unbeleavable!" 
Tenchi said

	"Well you see I'm from Jerai and Jasons from the Planet Alpha." Michael 
said

	Everyone fell over 

	"I guess my missions over with." Michael said

	"Well you ready to leave Jason?" Michael asked

	"I guess." Jason said

MM.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"I have completed my Mission. And I'm heading back to G.P. headquarters." 
Michael said talking to the  Chief of police.

	"Guess what? New orders. As of now Bounty Hunter Michael and Bounty Hunter 
Jason have been assigned to patrol the solar system!" The Chief of police said.

	"WHAT!!!!!! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME! OUT OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE G.P.

	"All right I can continue my Vacation on Earth!" Jason said happily!

	"Are you nuts? We are being paired up with Mihoshi. That's the worst thing

may happen later! Thanks to all my fans!
