                                       MUYO!

                                   HELLO UZUKO!

Sasami: Hmmm... (Cooking dinner) Tenchi!
Tenchi: Yes, Sasami?
Sasami: Do you think this tastes all right?
Tenchi: (Sips) Uh... I think you need some more carrots, beef, and and-
Sasami: I thought so too, Tenchi! Can you please get me more carrots? I
don't have anymore.
Tenchi: All right Sasami. (Picks up the basket) I'll be back in a few
minutes.
Sasami: Okay Tenchi!
(Leaves out the door)
Tenchi: (Thinks: Is it me, or do we always run out of carrots?)
(Where the carrots were, Ryo-ohki is lays on its big belly)
Sasami: 'Gasp' did you eat all the carrots, Ryo-ohki?
Ryo-ohki: Reow! (Shakes its head numbly)
Sasami: Ryo-ohki! Naughty cabbit!

(In the carrot fields)

Tenchi: (Thinks: Picking carrots is such hard work)
(Someone suddenly appears)
Tenchi: Uh?
Ryoko: TENCHI! (Hugs Tenchi so hard that she practically choking him)
Tenchi: OW! STOP RYOKO! YOU'RE CHOKING ME!
Ryoko: (Let's go of him) Oh, sorry Tenchi.
Tenchi: (Breathing heavily) When...will...you...stop...
Ayeka: (Running) Lord Tenchi! Sasami wants you!
Tenchi: (Still breathes heavily)
Ryoko: Oh, great...
Ayeka: (Stops running) Lord Tenchi, what's the matter?
Tenchi: Ryo-
Ryoko: Nothing at all, we were just about to kiss.
Ayeka: What?!
Tenchi: N-no, Miss Ayeka...
Ayeka: Urrrr! I don't believe you!
Ryoko: Well, you better. Tenchi and I are so much in love. (Starts to hug
Tenchi again)
Tenchi: Ryoko!
Ayeka: Stop it! (Then tries to hit Ryoko. But, accidentally hits Tenchi
instead)
Tenchi: OUCH!
Ayeka: Lord Tenchi!
Ryoko: Tenchi! Oh, what did that old witch do to you!
Ayeka: OLD WITCH?!!! YOU'RE THE OLD DEMON HERE!!!!!!
Ryoko: DEMON?! WHY YOU LITTLE-
(Suddenly a stranger appears)
????: Uh, excuse me...
Ryoko & Ayeka: WHAT???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tenchi: 'Gasp' You-you look like-like-
Ryoko: (Turns her head) Wha-wha?!!
Ayeka: Oh my!!!!!!!!! (Puts her hand in front of her mouth. Thinks: He looks
like Ryoko!! But he's quite handsome)
????: Uh... Do you know where I can find Miss Ryoko and Miss Washu?
Ryoko: I'M RYOKO!!!! WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE ME?!!
????: You're Ryoko? You're not as pretty as I expected...
Ryoko: WHAT?! YOU BETTER SHUT YOUR MOUTH YOU STUPID LOOK
ALIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
????: (Teardrop) My sister's violent... Anyways, my name is Uzuko. Nice to
meet all of you.
Tenchi: How'd you get here? Where did you come from?
Uzuko: Uh, well, I...don't know...
Ryoko: (Teardrop) You're stupid! (Hits him on the head)
Uzuko: HEY! (Raises his fist)
Ayeka: Ryoko!! Don't treat him like that!
Ryoko: Humph, he's the one that called me ugly! (Points at Uzuko)
Uzuko: It's the truth! YOU ARE UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!
Ayeka: Hahaha!!! I think he's right!
Tenchi: (Teardrop) I don't think so...
Ryoko: (Clasps her hands) You really think so Tenchi?!
Uzuko: Bet he's just lying...
Ryoko: Shut up!! (Hits Uzuko REALLY hard)
Uzuko: OW! (Falls down. Stars are dancing over his head)
Ayeka: Mr. Uzuko!
Tenchi: Ryoko! You didn't have to do that!
Ryoko: Oh yes I did.
Ayeka: I guess we have to carry him to the house...
Tenchi: But still, I wonder where he came from...

(At the house)

Sasami: Tenchi, did you get the carrots?
Tenchi: (While holding Uzuko's arm over his shoulder. Uzuko's other arm is
over Ryoko) Yes, Sasami. But Miss Ayeka has the basket.
Sasami: 'Gasp' who is that?!
Mihoshi: Did Ryoko turn to a guy?
Ryoko: NO, YOU IDIOT!!!!!! I'M RIGHT HERE!!!!!
Mihoshi: Oh... 'Cause I thought you were kinda' cute... (Giggles)
(Everyone: Teardrop)
Ayeka: 'Gasp' Brother Yosho! You're here! (Hugs Yosho. Gives the basket to
Sasami)
Tenchi: Hello Grandfather.
Yosho: Good-evening Tenchi.
Ayeka: Are you staying for dinner?
Yosho: Yes I am, Ayeka. (Notices) Who do have their Tenchi?
Tenchi: Ummm... his name is Uzuko... he arrived while I was working in the
fields.
Yosho: Hmmm... he looks like you Ryoko. Except that he has shorted spiked
hair than you and has a short tail.
Ryoko: I can't tell if that's an insult or not... but yeah... I see the
resemblance.
Washu: (With a plate while giggling) I can't believe it!!! I made this dish
all by myself! And- 'gasp' (Drops the dish) Whispers: Uzuko... (Kneels down
next to him) Is it really you? Is it?
Tenchi: Do you know him Little Washu?
Washu: I do know him... He's Ryoko's twin brother....my son.
Everyone: What?!
Ryoko: I have a brother?!
Washu: Yes. (Lifts his chin) When Kagato controlled us, I made both of you.
But, I used the Three Jewels of Dark for him.  He then got more powerful
then Kagato, and tried to kill him by using the Dark Wings of Death. (Stands
up) But, the Dark Wings of Death were too powerful to control. As a result,
he got trapped into another dimension... I'm amazed he's still alive.
Uzuko: Uhhh... (Opens his eyes)
Washu: Uzuko!
Uzuko: Oww... My head... (Puts his hands on his head)
Washu: How on earth did you get out of Space-subbed Dimension?
Uzuko: Space-subbed wha? I don't remember any of that.
Washu: You don't remember anything? Hmmm... if that's the case, then you're
going to have to become my test subject!!!
Uzuko: Test subject?!
Washu: Yup! (Pulls him by the neck to her lab)
(Washu shuts the door to her lab)
Uzuko: HEY! LET GO OF ME!
Washu: Now, now, Uzuko! Be good boy and stay still!
Uzuko: What the?! HEY!!!! THAT HURTS!!!!!! OWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SSTTTTTOOPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone: (Teardrop)
Tenchi: That must hurt...
Sasami: Probably does... with the way he's screaming...
Ryoko: Oh well, let's EAT!
Ayeka: Ryoko! He's your own brother!!
Ryoko: Touchy, touchy, don't tell me you LIKE him now, princess.
Ayeka: WHAT?!! (Blushes) Of course I don't!!!!
Tenchi: Washu is the scariest person when you're her test subject...
Mihoshi: I feel sorry for him.
Yosho: I do too...
Noboyuki: Hmmm... Hey, let's follow what Ryoko said and eat!
Tenchi: Father, don't you think we should help him?!
(Ryoko and Noboyuki starts eating)
Ryoko: Of course not! Whenever Washu gets a Test Subject, she does anything
with it. 'Munch...munch...'
Ayeka: Ryoko, eat with your mouth closed!
Ryoko: Whatever.
Tenchi: (Teardrop) You really don't even care about him, huh?
Ryoko: Uh...
Noboyuki: Oh, come now son just eat!
(Everyone hears yelling from Washu's lab)
Uzuko: OOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THHAATTT HHHUUUURRRRRRRTTTTTSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sasami: We might as well eat.
Ayeka: Sasami!
Tenchi: She's right. Washu going to keep doing that to Uzuko no matter what
we do.
Ayeka: But-
Ryoko: But nothing!
Mihoshi: Come on Miss Ayeka! Let's eat!
Ayeka: I-I... Fine. (Thinks: I still think it wrong to leave him like that)
(After A couple minutes, Uzuko runs out Washu's door)
Uzuko: I feel sick... (Holds his stomach)
Washu: (Comes running after him) Come back here!!!
Uzuko: Oh great... (Suddenly he disappears)
Washu: Urrrgh!!! Where did he go!!
Ayeka: Mr. Uzuko!
Ryoko: Just when we were eating!
Ayeka: (Looks at Ryoko and yells) IF YOU WANT TO EAT THEN EAT!!!!!
Washu: Ryoko, go find him!!
Ryoko: Why?
Washu: Because-because- Urrr! Just listen to your mother Ryoko!
Ryoko: Why should I?
Tenchi: Please Ryoko, just do it!
Ryoko: Oh fine... (Disappears to the roof) Hmmm... (Looks around) Not here.
(Disappears again to the fields) Arrgh! Not here either! (Disappears to
Yosho's Space Tree) Huh? There he is!
Uzuko: (Looks at Ryoko) What do you want?
Ryoko: (Disappears to reappear next to Uzuko) Ma wants ya. SO I'm gonna take
you to her.
Uzuko: Nah! Washu gonna poke me that thing of hers again!
Ryoko: What thing? When she tests me she doesn't poke me with a thing.
Uzuko: (Flies backward) Hey, she does that to me. It hurts badly.
Ryoko: What else am I suppose to do? She's going to get you sooner or later.
Uzuko: 'Sigh' (Looks down) Yeah... I know.
Ryoko: So why don't you just come with me now and get the test over with...
Uzuko: Uhhh...
Ryoko: (Flies to Uzuko) Come on brother! (Grabs his arm)
Uzuko: I don't want to!
Ryoko: IDIOT! Come on! (Pulls him harder and disappears with him)


(At the house)

Ayeka: (Thinks: I wonder where Uzuko and Ryoko is)
Tenchi: Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: Huh? Oh, yes Tenchi?
Tenchi: Is anything wrong? You're hardly eating.
Ayeka: Uh... I'm not that hungry. (Blushes) But, you don't have to worry
about me Tenchi.
Washu: It can't possibly take Ryoko-... Hmmm?
(Ryoko appears with Uzuko arm in arm)
Ryoko: Mission accomplished!
Uzuko: 'Sighs' (Puts his hand to his head) just shut up.
Ryoko: HEY!
Washu: You did it Ryoko! Now all we need to do-
Sasami: Ummm... Miss Washu? Can't we let Mr. Uzuko eat first?
Washu: Huh? But I-
Ayeka: Yes, let him eat first.
Tenchi: Yea, it be better like that Little Washu.
Mihoshi: Then we can all eat together! Tee-hee!
Washu: Oh all right.
Uzuko: Then after that, let me sleep first and-
Washu: Don't push your luck.
Ayeka: (Grabs Uzuko arm) Sit here with me... Mr. Uzuko.
Uzuko: Huh? Oh sure Princess Ayeka.
Ayeka: (Blushes) Just call me Miss Ayeka.
Uzuko: All right then.
Ryoko: (Thinks: Tenchi's ALL mine...) YESSSS!!!
Uzuko: Huh? What the-?
Tenchi: What did you say Ryoko?
Ryoko: Wha-?! OH! Nothing... can I sit by you Tenchi?
Tenchi: Of course!
Uzuko: My sister's weird...
Ryoko: What?!
Uzuko: You said 'yes' for nothing. What are you thinking about, stuffing
your mouth with food?
Ryoko: No, YOUR MOUTH!! (Grabs some food and stuffs it down his throat.)
Uzuko: Ow... (With the food in his mouth)
Sasami: You guys are a bunch of kids.
Washu: Stop fighting! You guys hardly know each other and you're ALREADY
acting like brother and sister!
Uzuko: Why does SHE have to be my sister?
Ryoko: Do you want ANOTHER HELPING?! (Grabs some more food)
Ayeka: Stop you two. I really JUST want to eat.
Ryoko: All right, prissy princess.
Ayeka: WHAT?!
Uzuko: You two act like brats.
Ryoko & Ayeka: SHUT UP!!! (Throws food at his face)
Uzuko: Guess no one likes me yet...
(After dinner)
Uzuko: Mmmm... that was the best food I ever tasted, Sasami.
Sasami: I'm glad you enjoyed it Mr. Uzuko! Thanks a lot!
Washu: Now that you're done... LET'S GO!
Uzuko: But- but- but...
Washu: No buts... let's go... (Grabs his neck while he's sitting down. Then
she drags him while he's sitting down)
Uzuko: HEY!! LET GO OF ME!!!! DON'T DO THIS TO ME!!! YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO BE MY
MOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Washu: Now, now, Uzuko, it just going to take a little while. (Opens the
door of her lab. Then closes the door)
Uzuko: HEY, DON'T PUT ME IN THAT THING!!!!!
Washu: (Snaps her fingers) Don't worry Uzuko, it just take 5 hours.
Uzuko: 5 HOURS???!!!!!!!!!!!! OOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryoko: My poor brother...
Ayeka: Oh, so now you're worried about him.
Ryoko: Just shut your mouth.
Sasami: I hope he'll be okay.
Mihoshi: Washu's not going kill him or anything will she?
Everyone: (Teardrop) NO!!!
Mihoshi: Oh, okay! Hee-hee!
Ayeka: (Looks down at her plate) I don't know how much more I can take...
Uzuko: HEY!!! WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT-... NNNOOOOOOOOO!!!
SSTTTOOOOOOPPPPP!!!!!! OOWWWW!!!!!!!
Tenchi: I see what you mean...
Ryoko: Ugh, I gonna check something. (She floats to Washu's lab door. Knocks
on the door) HEY!!! WHAT EXACTLY ARE DOING?!!
Washu: (Opens the door and sticks her head out) Oh Ryoko! You're the person
I was just looking for! (Grabs her arm and pulls her in)
Ryoko: Huh? What the heck?
(They hear a Washu snaps her fingers)
Ryoko: GREAT!!! JUST GRE- OWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sasami: Oh no... Now she's doing the same thing to Ryoko.
Ayeka: 'Sighs'
Tenchi: Now what are we suppose to do...
Mihoshi: Can't we just play a game?
Yosho: I must get back to the shrine. But, I'm sure they will both be fine.
Nobuyuki: I'm sure they are fine too. I hope they will just stop yell-
Ryoko & Uzuko: OWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tenchi: He's worse off then me...
Ayeka: What do you mean Lord Tenchi?
Tenchi: Huh? Oh nothing.
Sasami: Why don't we watch T.V?
Tenchi: All right.
Ayeka: I think I'll go to sleep.
Mihoshi: Why, Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: Oh, I'm just a little sleepy...
Tenchi: (First she says she's not hungry and now she say she's sleepy... I
hope nothing wrong with her... I know!) I'll walk you to your room, Miss
Ayeka.
Ayeka: Huh? (Blushes) Thank you, Lord Tenchi.
Ryoko & Uzuko: OOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SSSSTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(Next afternoon)

(Both Ryoko and Uzuko are leaning on Washu's lab door. They are shoulder by
shoulder)
Uzuko: She said it would only take 5 hours...
Ryoko: Don't believe EVERYTHING she's says.
Uzuko: Some Mother...
Ryoko: Too bad she's OUR  mother...
(Washu opens the door. Ryoko and Uzuko both fall next to Washu feet)
Washu: You two better be careful! You just don't lean on doors like that! I
taught you better than that!
Ryoko: You taught us nothin'!
Uzuko: Except pain...
Washu: I NEVER TAUGHT YOU THAT!
Uzuko: Or anything else...
Ryoko: He's right.
(Ayeka then comes down the stairs)
Ayeka: What are you doing on the floor? That's very impolite.
Uzuko: SORRY, I'm not perfect.
Ayeka: Ugh, you're more troublesome than Ryoko!
Ryoko: SHUT IT PRINCESS!
Uzuko: No way! I ain't more troublesome than Miss Elf here! (Points at
Ryoko)
Ryoko: WHAT?! Don't forget you have the same ears as I do, Elf boy!
Washu: (Smashes them both with a pot) You two better stop fighting or I have
you as my Test subject again!
Ryoko: Wha-wha?
Uzuko: No!!
(Both of them get on there knees and put their hands together)
Ryoko & Uzuko: We're Sorry!!!
Washu & Ayeka: (Teardrop)
Sasami: Tenchi? Tenchi? (She goes where everyone else is) Have you seen
Tenchi?
Ayeka: No, I haven't. Why Sasami?
Sasami: Ryo-ohki ate all the carrots again. I need Tenchi to get some more.
Uzuko: (Stands up) Do you want me get some Sasami?
Ryoko, Washu, & Ayeka: Huh?
Sasami: That will be great Uzuko! Thanks a lot! (Gives him the basket)
Uzuko: I'll be right back. (Disappears)
Ryoko: No way! Sarcastic boy is NICE?
Sasami: He's really nice to me.
Ayeka: He is? (Thinks: Why is he so nice to Sasami?)
Washu: Hmmm... In some ways he's better than Ryoko...
Ryoko: WHAT?!
Ayeka: And in some ways he's not.
Ryoko: That I agree on.
Sasami: Oh, Ryoko.
Ayeka: Where is Tenchi, anyways?
Washu: Last time I checked, he was at Lord Yosho's shrine.
Ayeka: Brother Yosho's?
Washu: Yes.
Ryoko: What is he doing there?
Sasami: He might be training.
Ayeka: Yes, I think he is.
(At the carrot field)

Uzuko: (Thinks: I don't know why, but picking carrots stinks) ............
Urrrgh... This one not coming out! (Pulls REALLY hard) Huh? AHHH!!! (Falls
on his butt)
(Ryoko then comes out of the ground)
Ryoko: Is that carrot really that hard to pull out?
Uzuko: (Hits her on the head) You were pulling on it, huh!
Ryoko: Don't hit, me idiot!
Uzuko: You're pathetic. (Grabs the basket fill with carrots)
Ryoko: Shut up.
Uzuko: Whatever. (Disappears)
Ryoko: Now, should I bother Tenchi or should I not, that's the question...

(At the house)

Uzuko: Sasami! I have thee carrots!
Sasami: (Walks in the kitchen) Thank you so much Mr. Uzuko!
Uzuko: Don't call me that. That's too polite.
Sasami: What should I call you then?
Uzuko: Hmmm... How about... LORD Uzuko! Nah, just joking.
Sasami: Hahaha! You're funny. But I can call you Lord if you want.
Uzuko: No, its okay.
Sasami: Then what can I call you?
Uzuko: Just... Uzuko. Okay?
Sasami: (Giggle) Okay.
Ayeka: (Walks into the kitchen) Sasami! Sa- oh! Mr. Uzuko... what are you
doing here?
Uzuko: Huh? Oh just giving Sasami her carrots.
Ryo-ohki: Reow!!
Uzuko: Not yours... (Lifts up the basket)
Ryo-ohki: (Teardrop) Reow!
Sasami: (Giggle) She can have one, Uzuko!
Uzuko: But, if I do that, she just gonna get hooked on them.
Ayeka: (Takes one carrot from the basket) Here you go, Ryo-ohki!
Uzuko: HEY!
Ayeka: (Looks at him) Just one... (Looks at Ryo-ohki) No more until
dinner... (Stands up) Sasami... are you done with the wash?
Sasami: Yes Sister.
Ayeka: Good, I'll go hang them up then. Please get dinner ready.
Uzuko: I really can't believe princesses actually work...
Ayeka: (Blushing) We didn't on Jurai... but, I'm used to it now.
Uzuko: Oh, well... You're WAY better than Ryoko. Lazy twit won't do a thing!
Ayeka: (Turns red) Uh... Hahaha! I know!
Sasami: Stop flirting!
Ayeka: Hahaha! Oh Sasami, honestly, why would you think such a thing!
Sasami: You're turning red!
Uzuko: Hahaha!!!!!!!!
Ayeka: Oh shut up!
Uzuko: I can't help it... Hahaha! You're still turning red!
Ayeka: (Gets a carrot and sticks it in his mouth) Be quiet! (Walks away)
Uzuko: Gee... I'm getting hand-fed! (Starts munching on the carrot)
Sasami: (Takes the carrot out of his mouth) You're not suppose to eat any
carrots till dinnertime!
Ryo-ohki: Reow! (Nods her head)
Uzuko: Uh...

(Outside)

Ryoko: (Thinks: Where is Tenchi? His Grandfather said he left a couple
minutes ago...) Huh? (What was that?)
Tenchi: Urrrr! Stupid Rag! Come on!
Ryoko: (Looks over some bushes) What is he doing?
Tenchi: (Pulling a rag) Urrrr!!! Need...to...finish...chores... whoa!!!
(Falls on head)
Ryoko: (Flies over to him. Kneels down toward Tenchi.) What's the matter
Tenchi?
Tenchi: Oh Ryoko! Washu dropped some device on my rag.
Ryoko: Oh, you're doing chores?
Tenchi: (Sits up) Yea, why?
Ryoko: I thought you were training.
Tenchi: I was... but I missed a step and Grandfather doubled my
chores...again.
Ryoko: Y'know, since my brother's here now, why don't he just do the other
half of your chores.
Tenchi: You really think he'd do that for me?
Ryoko: No.
Tenchi: Oh... Then why don't you help me?
Ryoko: ME?!
Tenchi: Come on Ryoko! You hardly do anything!
Ryoko: But Tenchi! I-I-
Tenchi: (Grabs her hand) Come on Ryoko!
Ryoko: I don't like chores!
Tenchi: Well... Someone has to do it. And it's us! So come on! (Pulls her to
the shed)
Ryoko: Ugh!
Tenchi: What is it?
Ryoko: I don't feel like doing this!
Tenchi: Ryoko, please!
Ryoko: (Looks at Tenchi, then smiles) Fine, I'll do it... for you.
Tenchi: Thank you Ryoko... (Warmly smiles)

(At Washu's lab)

Washu: Hmmm... Oh! Ryoko and Uzuko are opposite in senses... So Uzuko can
feel the cold while Ryoko can't... He can taste food and Ryoko can't...
Uzuko: Ma?
Washu: Yes... Uzuko?
Uzuko: What the heck are you doing?
Washu: I'm looking at the results of the test.
Uzuko: SO? How'd it come out? Please say she's not my sister!
Washu: Ryoko... IS your sister, but your TOTAL opposite in senses.
Uzuko: Oh... Huh?! (Lies down in mid- air)
Washu: 'Sigh'... You can feel the cold, right?
Uzuko: Uh... yeah... so?
Washu: Ryoko can't feel the cold at all! She can't taste food either.
Uzuko: But I can, right?
Washu: Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
Uzuko: Hardly... So why can't she feel cold? Or taste food?
Washu: Uh...
Uzuko: Why can't I smell things? Why can't I feel the heat? And why didn't
you make a COMPLETE model of us? (Lands on feet)
Washu: HEY!!
Uzuko: You're SUPPOSE to be the GREATEST SCIENTIST IN THE UNIVERSE. But you
can't even make a COMPLETE human!
Washu: HEY!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!! (Hits him on the head with a pipe)
Uzuko: Oww... maybe I should keep my mouth shut (Rubs his hand on his head)
Washu: Maybe that knocked some sense into you!!!
Uzuko: Humph... (Stands up and brushes his pants)
Washu: (Sits down near her computer) Go check what your sister is doing...
Give me any more trouble and I'll make you my Test Subject again!
Uzuko: Yes, Ma...  (Disappears)

(Outside Ryoko is sweeping and Tenchi is raking the leaves)

Ryoko: Darn chores...
Uzuko: (Appears right in front of Ryoko) Surprise! (Takes the broom)
Ryoko: AAAHHHHHH!!!! What the hell are you doing here?! (Grabs the broom
back)
Uzuko: Ma told me to check on you... just incase you were doing something
naughty with Tenchi... (Devilishly smiles and looks over her shoulder to
look at Tenchi. Then looks at her again)
Ryoko: What's that supposed to mean?! I KNOW you wanna get with AYEKA!!!!
Uzuko:  N-no I d-don't... (Looks down while blushing)
Tenchi: (Stops raking) Whew!
Ryoko: Ha, I knew it!! (Points at Uzuko)
Tenchi: (Looks up) Huh? Hi Uzuko! (Waves then goes back to work)
Uzuko: Hey Tenchi! (Looks at Ryoko)
Ryoko: (Devilishly giggling) Hmmm... Uzuko and Princess Ayeka. Well, well...
don't you make a cute couple! Hahaha!!!!
Uzuko: WHAT!?!?!?! NO-WAY!!!
Ryoko: Hahahaha!!! Then why are you getting so red!? Hahahaha!!!!!
Uzuko: SHUT UP!!! (Grabs the broom and hits her in the head)
Ryoko: YOU BASTARD!!! GET BACK HERE!!!!!! (Flies after Uzuko while swinging
the broomstick after him)
Tenchi: 'Sigh.' At this rate, I'll never get my chores done. (Looks up) Huh?
Uzuko: (Flying) WATCH OOOOOUUUUUUTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!! (Swoops upwards. Then
disappears)
Tenchi: (Quickly dodges Uzuko) Whoa!!!!
Ryoko: COME AND FACE ME YOU COWARD!!!! (Floats in mid air)
Tenchi: (Breathing heavily) What was that about?!
Ryoko: (Looks at Tenchi) Oh! Tenchi! (Flies down near him) Are you okay?
Tenchi: Yeah!!! (Breaths normally) But that almost gave me a heart attack!!!
What WAS that about!!!
Ryoko: Oh... just a little family feud. Hahaha! Nothing to worry about!
(Lands on feet and helps Tenchi up. Looks at the sky) 'sigh' isn't it
beautiful Tenchi?
Tenchi: (Looks at the sky) It certainly is Ryoko. Well, we should probably
head home now. It's getting late.
Ryoko: Yeah...
Tenchi: (Picks up the broom and the rake and puts them by the wall) Come on.

(Once at the house)

(Ayeka and Uzuko are standing next to one another talking)
Ayeka: Huh? Oh Lord Tenchi! (In a dull voice) and... Ryoko.
Tenchi: Hello Miss Ayeka... (Turns his head) Uzuko.
Uzuko: Hey, sorry 'bout earlier.
Tenchi: It's okay.
Uzuko: Oh, it's you... (Looks at Ryoko)
Ryoko: Shut up, Lover boy!
Uzuko: At least I'm not some pervert.
Ryoko: Whom are you calling a PERVERT???!!!!!!
Uzuko: Try and guess.
Ayeka: Shut up, the both of you! Lord Tenchi?
Tenchi: Yes Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: (Grab's Tenchi's arm) Let's leave! (Takes him inside)
Uzuko: Did we say something wrong?
Ryoko: Guess your prissy princess doesn't even like you. (Sticks out her
tongue)
Uzuko: Humph, too bad TENCHI likes her. (Disappears)
Ryoko: Urrrgh... (Disappears)

(At the dinner table)

Sasami: Does anyone want some more rice?
Uzuko: No thank you.
Ryoko: No, I'm full.
Tenchi: No thank you.
Mihoshi: Uh, where's the rice?
Tenchi: Sasami just asked you if you wanted some...
Mihoshi: Oh yea! Tee-hee!!
Ryoko: Ditz...
Ayeka: Ugh... I not that hungry...
Tenchi: Huh? Why Miss Ayeka?
Uzuko: Are you on a diet or something?
Ayeka: No, it just so happens I'm not hungry.
Uzuko: Good, 'cause you're already a toothpick.
Ayeka: WHAT?! (Grabs him by his collar)
Sasami: Can't just we stop fighting and eat?
Uzuko: Uh... A pretty toothpick? Hahaha (laugh quickly fades)
Ayeka: (Blushes. Slowly lets go of his collar) Mr. Uzuko!!!
Ryoko: Aren't you two the happy couple?
Ayeka: What are talking about?! I'll NEVER like Uzuko!!! Tenchi will forever
be the man in my heart!!!
Ryoko: TENCHI IS THE MAN IN MY HEART!!!! He NEVER be yours, NEVER!!!!!!!!!
