Tenchi Muyo!:
Love is Eternal
by
Kakaroto


Author's Note:
	Okay, normally this is where I would introduce the fic, but, seeing as how 
it's a special occasion (meaning this is dedicated to my good friend, Damien 
Stryker, who was my chief inspiration), I'll let the Juraiian Royal Guardians, 
Azaka and Kamidake, take over that part.

AZAKA: Thank you for this dubious honor.
KAMIDAKE: Yes. We will most certainly try our best to do a proper introduction.
AZAKA: This is a tale of love...
KAMIDAKE: As if you couldn't tell by the title.
AZAKA: As I was saying, this is a tale of love in a place where one would almost 
never expect to find it.
KAMIDAKE: Yes, it certainly is unexpected.
	
	Um, well, yeah, I guess that'll do. (Mental Note: Fire Royal Guardians.) 
At least they didn't give away the plot too much. As for the standard 
disclaimer, I in no way own any character that you have ever seen in the Tenchi 
Muyo! Anime series (yes, I'm aware that there are three of them) or in the 
movies (even though I'm not exactly sure how many of those there are). Oh, and 
in case anyone is wondering, this takes place in the Tenchi Universe series 
(mainly 'cause it's my favorite), but will have some alternate-universe elements 
in it (you'll see what I mean). Oh, and this is my first-ever Tenchi Muyo Lemon, 
so don't flame me too harshly.

Tenchi Muyo!:
Love is Eternal

Part One:
No Need for Yuri Scenes


	 It all started on an abnormal day at the Masaki house. By abnormal, I 
mean it was quiet. There were no explosions, no starships crashing into the 
lake, no screaming, nothing. 
	Ryoko was laying on the roof and had managed to fall asleep in the noon 
sun while waiting for Tenchi to return home from school. Ayeka was sprawled on 
the couch reading one of Katsuhito's books on ancient swords. Sasami was in the 
kitchen preparing lunch while Ryo-Ohki stalked the carrot basket. Mihoshi and 
Kiyone had been called back to Galaxy Police HQ for a routine efficiency 
analysis. Nobuyuki was at the office, Washu was in her lab, and Katsuhito was 
tending to his duties at the shrine atop the hill. No-one complained about the 
oh-so-rare peace that had descended upon the house, but later they would wish 
that they had enjoyed it more thoroughly.
	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!" A blood-curling scream from the 
supply closet-turned-laboratory and the semi-tall, semi-mad genius Washu erupted 
from the door, slamming it behind her.
	"What happened, Miss Washu?" Ayeka asked, placing the book on the coffee 
table.
	"One of my dimensional portals opened, and a creature like I've never laid 
eyes upon before invaded my lab!"
	Sasami, walking out of the kitchen, asked, "Um, Washu? Did this 'creature' 
have ten arms, six legs and look vaguely humanoid except for the three heads, 
reddish skin color and being fifty feet tall?"
	"Why, yes. How did you ever guess that?" Washu asked the young princess.
	"Because it wasn't just your lab it invaded!!!!" Katsuhito said, running 
towards the house while being chased by one of the many-limbed beings.
	Sighing, Ayeka walked out the front door. "I guess we have to do 
everything around here. Azaka! Kamidake!" As the princess voiced her command, 
the two Royal Guardians appeared beside her, poised for battle. However, before 
Ayeka could tell them what to do, one of the creatures smacked them away with 
some of its arms. They flew upward and somewhat to the south, and Katsuhito 
could swear he heard them yell, "We're sorry, Princess!" before they were out of 
sight.
	Ayeka, meanwhile, had charged up her force-field, but, with three of the 
monsters hammering it with their arms, she knew she couldn't hold it forever. 
Just as she thought she was doomed, a trio of red energy beams hit one of the 
creatures square in what passed for the chest, knocking it back and startling 
the other two into stopping their attack. Looking up to where she guessed the 
beams came from, Ayeka saw Ryoko hovering in the air, dressed in her black-and-
red combat suit. With a smirk, the ex-pirate landed beside her rival.
	"You okay, Princess?" she asked.
	"Yes. Thank you, Ryoko." For some reason Ayeka hadn't been able to 
explain, Ryoko had been fighting with her less and less. Stranger still, the 
other woman actually seemed to care about the First Princess of Jurai.
	Nodding her head in the direction of the five creatures, Ryoko asked, 
"Shall we?"
	With a smirk that would make Nagi proud, Ayeka replied, "Yes. Let's give 
them some payback for ruining our quiet day." With that, Ryoko formed two energy 
swords in her hands and Ayeka charged up enough energy to wipe out Beijing. The 
two women charged, their slashes and blasts driving the interdimensional 
creatures backwards in the direction of the lake. When one of them lost its 
balance and went careening into the water, courtesy of Ayeka, it seemed to 
dissolve in the crystal-clear liquid.
	"Somehow, I expected these things to put up more of a fight." Ryoko said, 
using a roundhouse kick to send one of the beings into the lake and watched it 
writhe as the water work its deadly wonders on the beast.
	"Yes. It is somewhat of a disappointment. But, I suppose not every 
opponent has to be as strong as Kagato." Katsuhito observed, using his bokken to 
trip one of the aliens into the pond.
	Charging an energy blast of her own, Washu blasted a hole in the torso of 
the being nearest her, giggling as it, too, joined its companions in their 
watery grave. "Four down, one to go."
	"This one's mine!" Sasami said, stepping out of the house and holding up a 
huge laser cannon. "Those things disturbed me while I was cooking, and now our 
lunch is RUINED!" Taking aim, she pulled the trigger, sending a green bolt at 
the last monster, causing it to rear back before toppling into the lake.
	"I guess that takes care of them, wouldn't you say, Ryoko?" Ayeka said, 
dropping her force-field.
	"Um, I wouldn't count on that, Princess. You're forgetting about the one 
in Washu's lab." Ryoko reminded her.
	"ACK! That's right! Who knows what havoc that thing could be wreaking on 
my inventions!" Washu exclaimed, running for the house. Before she could reach 
the door, however, the last of the aliens burst out of her lab and onto the 
lawn, destroying half the house in the process.
	In a deep, earth-shaking voice, it said, "Come to me, my demon brothers, 
and take revenge on these mortals!" As the creature spoke these words, a red 
ooze began to seep out of the lake. It flowed across the grass like a river, 
making Katsuhito jump out of its path. When it reached the last demon, the ooze 
reared up and slammed into the creature's chest.
	Ayeka could not believe what she was seeing. As more and more of the ooze 
hit the alien, the creature began to grow. Soon, it was taller than Tokyo tower. 
"Now you shall feel the full power of Tarok Manda, King of Shunrah!"
	"Ayeka," Ryoko began, "I hate to tell you this, but we're doomed."
	"What do you mean by that, Ryoko? What kind of power does this thing 
have?"
	"Well, I've never actually laid eyes on it before today. That's why I 
didn't recognize it. But Manda and his army of demons made the stuff I did look 
like child's play, and I ain't talking about a movie starring a possessed doll.
	"Tarok Manda was also known as the Planet Killer. His demons would use 
interdimensional gateways to find planets with valuable natural resources - like 
oil and coal on this planet - and he would break the crust apart to get whatever 
it was he was after. This would go on for however long Manda was getting what he 
wanted. Then, after the resources were gone, he'd jump in his portal and look 
for another planet. Shortly after that, the planet that he mined dry would break 
apart, killing anyone who was left."
	Sasami was stunned. "But, why would someone do that?"
	Ryoko sighed before answering. "Not even Nagi could find that out. Some 
said that he was building a vast fleet of warships to conquer the galaxy, but he 
wouldn't need it with his powers. The most likely guess was that he was using 
the materials he stripped from other planets to make one for his people 
somewhere in an unexplored part of the galaxy."
	"It matters not what his reasons are," Katsuhito said. "It only matters 
that we end his reign of terror."
	"I agree, Lord Katsuhito," Washu said, pulling up her holographic 
computer. "But I think we'll need some added insurance." Pressing a button, she 
caused a huge dimensional pocket to open, revealing five Gundam-type machines.
	"Mother, what are those things?" Ryoko asked, pointing finger at the 
battlesuits.
	With an oh-so-kawaii smile, Washu walked up to the first in the line. It 
was the color of Sasami's eyes and looked a lot like a scorpion. "Basically, 
these are Mobile Suits. I became quite fascinated with Gundam Wing, so I decided 
to try my hand at building some of these puppies." Pointing to the arachnoid 
before her, she said, "This one is called Scorpio. I built its control systems 
with Lady Ayeka in mind."
	Pointing to the next in line, she said, "The rest are named for and 
modeled after mythical creatures. I call this one Centaur." Indeed, that was 
what it was shaped like. With a coloring that made it seem like it was made of 
pure silver, Washu explained this one was Katsuhito's.
	The next three were Cerberus (Ryoko's), Pegasus (Sasami's) and 
Quetzelcoatl (Washu's). All stared in awe at the machines, but Ryoko was the one 
to ask the obvious question. "Um, Mom? How are we supposed to work these 
things?"
	"Why, that's simple, Ryoko. All you do is stand at the base and wait for 
the computer to lock onto your bio-signatures. After that, you'll be instantly 
transported to the control module. Just put on the helmet inside and you'll be 
able to control the Mobile Suit."
	Sasami was the next to ask a question. "Did you happen to make a replica 
of any of the Gundams?"
	Washu got a sad look on her face. "Actually, Sasami, I wanted to, but then 
I found something called 'copyright infringement' which prohibited me from 
making a replica of any of the Suits in that series. These, however, are my own 
design, and I can use them freely. Any more questions?" After a short pause, she 
said, "Alright! Everyone suit up!"
	Following Washu's instructions, everyone stood directly beneath the head 
of their machine and were beamed into the control center. Well, except for 
Ryoko. After several seconds of waiting, she just teleported into the seat.
	"All systems ready." Washu said as she activated the control systems on 
her winged serpent-like attack vehicle. After hearing four confirmations of 
battle readiness, she led the charge.
	While Katsuhito used the Centaur's lance to keep the arms busy, Ayeka 
pinned down the legs with Scorpio's pincers and Ryoko utilized the	 claws 
of Cerberus to tear some of the armor-like skin from the torso of their 
adversary. Meanwhile, Washu snuck in from behind and used Quetzalcoatl's tail 
like a whip on Manda's spinal column. With Sasami flying up into the air and 
using the powerful wings of Pegesus to create a gail-force wind, the five 
warriors were ever-so-slowly pushing the 'Demon King' to his watery grave.
	"NOOOO!" Manda screamed as he began to sink. "How could I be defeated by 
weaklings such as yourselves?"
	Washu, now outside of her battle machine, smirked and said, "Simple. You 
never attacked the home of the galaxy's cutest genius." Then, looking at her 
companions, she added, "Or some of it's strongest fighters."
	Manda screamed in pain as the water dissolved him. "I will be back. Mark 
my words, I will have my revenge!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!........"
	"Well, he sure wasn't all he was cracked up to be." Ryoko said as the 
Mobile Suits disappeared.
	"I agree. Even Dr. Clay was stronger than this so-called King of Demons." 
After making a vain attempt to straighten her ruffled hair, Ayeka sighed and 
said, "I'm going to the onsen. Care to join me, Ryoko?" She then pointed to the 
torn clothes and scarred body of the former pirate.
	"Sure. I could use a soak in a nice hot tub." Ryoko replied as the two 
walked towards the house. Then, they remembered something. Thanks to Manda, the 
house was only a foundation, and not much of one, at that.
	"Here." Washu said, tossing a small box at what was left of the Masaki 
household. There was a loud explosion, and the house was suddenly there again. 
"I always keep a spare house stored in one of those micro-storage containers, 
just in case."
	The two women said their thank-yous and walked into the house.
********************************************************************************
***********************************
	Inside the onsen, Ryoko phased out of her combat suit and put a small 
floating basket containing soap ans shampoo into the water. She slid in up to 
her neck, enjoying the sensuous feelings the water gave her.
	Ayeka, however, had always worn a bathing suit or a towel into the water 
and, not seeing either of these around, she was forced to strip naked. 
'Fortunately', she thought, 'Ryoko isn't looking in my direction. Maybe she 
won't say anything.' Once she had all her clothes off, Ayeka timidly stepped 
into the water.
	As Ryoko looked over at Ayeka to start a conversation, she was shocked to 
see that the princess was nude. "Decide to go au natural today, Ayeka?" she 
asked with just a hint of playfulness.
	Ayeka let out a 'harumph' and replied, "I had no other choice, Ryoko. My 
swimsuit is in my room, and there are no towels in here. I would greatly 
appreciate it if you didn't make fun of my body."
	The next thing Ayeka knew, there was a pair of arms around her neck, two 
large breasts pressing into hers and she was staring into the golden eyes of 
Ryoko. "Why would I make fun of something I desire so much, princess?" she 
asked, a seductive tone in her voice.
	"Wha-what do you mean, Ryoko? I thought you were after Tenchi."
	"I am. But, there's nothing in the book that says I woman can't play both 
sides of the fence. That's why Nagi's after me. We used to date, but she was 
just too controlling for my liking. So, I left her. She swore she'd get me back. 
Well, it looks like you and Tenchi managed to reel my heart in first."
	"Ryoko, I don't know what to say. Is this why you've been so nice to me 
lately?"
	"Yes, Ayeka. It didn't happen all at once, but I eventually grew to love 
you just as much as I love Tenchi. I could barely stand to be around you without 
staring at you, and knowing I could never have you." Reluectantly, Ryoko pulled 
away. "I'm sorry if I offended you. I just had to get that off my chest." With 
that, Ryoko rose up out of the water and began walking up the stone stairs. That 
is, until she felt a soft hand on her shoulder. Turning around, she found 
herself gazing into the compassionate violet eyes of Ayeka.
	"You saved my life today, Ryoko. What kind of princess would I be if I 
left a debt unpaid?"
	Ryoko was stunned. "You mean......you would let me.......?"
	Ayeka sighed and said, "Yes, Ryoko. If you want me so bad," she backed off 
a bit, opening her arms for Ryoko, "take me."
	With a smile on her face and a tear in the corner of one eye, Ryoko moved 
forward and embraced Ayeka. It was tentative at first, neither girl really sure 
about the situation, but, after a few moments passed, they grew more comfortable 
with it and they pressed closer together, Ayeka wrapping her arms around Ryoko's 
torso.
	Now the two former enemies were so close together that their faces were 
only two inces apart. Ayeka could feels Ryoko's breasts pressing into her again, 
and, along with the warmth from inbewteen the pirate's legs, the feeling was 
turning her on. Pushing her inhibitions to the side, she leaned forward and 
captured Ryoko's lips with her own.
	Needless to say, Ryoko was in heaven when one of her two objects of desire 
kissed her. However, being the way she is, she needed more. So, she moved her 
hands down Ayeka's back until they reached the soft curves of her buttocks, 
which she squeezed and massaged without mercy. This caused the princess to open 
her mouth, which allowed Ryoko to thrust her tongue in.
	Ayeka was surprised at first, but eventually got used to it and began 
moving her tongue against Ryoko's while she moved her own hands downward and 
started giving her former rival the same massage she was receiving.
	Reluctantly breaking the kiss, Ryoko said, "Enough foreplay, princess. 
It's time to go to the main event." Lifting both herself and Ayeka out of the 
water, she landed them softly on a bamboo mat laid off to one side of the 
swimming pool-sized bathtub. She then began placing butterfly kisses along 
Ayeka's neck, trailing downward to kiss the breasts, pausing to suckle the 
nipples for a minute.
	Now it was Ayeka's turn to be in heaven. On Jurai, it was a custom for a 
princess to sleep with the suitors her father brought before her, but none of 
them excited her as much as Ryoko did, nor did they do the things she was doing. 
The princess moaned as Ryoko sucked on one breast, taking as much of it into her 
mouth as possible, while her hand played with the other one. Then she alternated 
her hand and mouth so as not to neglect any part of the royal body she had been 
craving for months.
	After playing with Ayeka's breasts for a few minutes, Ryoko began sliding 
down, planting kisses here and there, exciting her purple-haired lover even 
more. Finally, she reached the narrow slit and triangle of violet hair that 
marked the center of Ayeka's pleasure.
	"P-please, Ryoko," Ayeka said, barely able to contain her excitement. 
"Don't make me wait any longer."
	"Who am I to argue with the Crown Princess of Jurai?" With that, Ryoko 
plunged her tongue in, making Ayeka scream with pleasure. After a short two 
minutes, Ryoko had succeeded in giving Ayeka an orgasm, at the onset of which 
the princess screamed almost loud enough to break glass. With a gleam in her 
eye, Ryoko licked up all of the honey-flavored juices that spilled out of 
Ayeka's entrance.
	After regaining her breath and her senses, Ayeka sat up and maneuvered 
Ryoko into a sitting position on one of the wooden benches in the room. Kneeling 
and using two fingers to open the pirate's folds, Ayeka shot her own tongue into 
the narrow space. Thoroughly satisfied by the sounds she was receiving from 
Ryoko, she raised her hands and began playing with her lover's breasts.
	With the attention and pleasure the princess was giving her, Ryoko soon 
climaxed, giving Ayeka her sweet, tangy juices as a reward. Once she came down 
from her natural high, Ryoko stood up on somewhat wobbly legs and went to a 
potted plant in the far corner of the room, one of the few spots where there was 
very little light.
	"What are you doing over there, Ryoko?" Ayeka asked. "Come back to me, and 
we can explore this....desire of yours even further."
	"Relax, Ayeka. I'm just getting something to further the pleasure." Ryoko 
fished around near the plant for a few seconds, then returned with a black bag 
in her hand.
	"What is that, Ryoko?"
	"It's something Mihoshi and Kiyone use when they're alone." With that, 
Ryoko reached into the back and pulled out a long, flexible, twin-headed dildo. 
"This brings back memories. Nagi had something like this, only hers vibrated." 
Ryoko said in revelry. "If only she hadn't turned into a total bitch...."
	Ayeka immediately knew what it was for, as she had used similar devices on 
Jurai inbetween suitor visits. But she had never seen one designed to be used by 
two women at once before. So, natuarally, she was excited by it. Snatching it 
out of Ryoko's hand, she jammed one end into her self and began thrusting it in 
and out her forcefully.
	"Hey, calm down, Princess." the pirate said, placing her hand over Ayeka's 
to stop her frantic actions. "You'll have planty of opportunities to use it. 
But, for now, let me work some of my magic on you." Sliding herself onto the 
free end of the dildo, she pressed downward until Ayeka was laying back on the 
mat and both girls had the entire object hidden from view. Ayeka moaned at the 
feeling of being filled so completely while Ryoko's clitoris pressed against 
hers. Before she could enjoy it too long, however, Ryoko began moving. Slowly at 
first, but, once both she and the princess became used to the feeling, she 
started going faster and harder, causing the moaning and screaming in the room 
to become almost too much to handle.
	Before they could reach ecstacy, however, Ayeka pulld away from Ryoko, who 
had a look of incredible shock on her face. Before the pirate could say 
anything, however, Ayeka turned around, got on all fours, and pointed to her 
'back door'. "Do me here, Ryoko."
	The cyan-haired beauty need no more prompting. Placing the end of the 
dildo at Ayeka's hole she pressed in, amazed at how tight the princess was.
	Ayeka had never felt anything like this before. She once used a dildo in 
that hole back on Jurai, but she hadn't gotten much pleasure from it, so she 
assumed that it wasn't an erogonous zone. Ryoko, however, proved her wrong. 
Ayeka screamed in plaeasure as Ryoko punded her ass for all it was worth, while 
reaching around and playing with Ayeka's breasts and pussy while she humped. 
They stayed like this for several minutes, neither one wanting it to end, until 
their orgasms hit and forced them to stop because of sheer exhaustion.
	After replacing the dildo and washing themselves off in the bath, Ayeka 
and Ryoko hugged and kissed for a while, but were too tired to do anything else. 
When they decided it was time to get out, Ayeka pointed to her tattered clothes. 
"I can't wear those on front of Lord Tenchi, and imagine what Lord Nobuyuki 
would say."
	"Not a problesm." Ryoko said, grabbing onto Ayeka. The next thing the 
princess knew, she was back in her room.
	"Thank you, Ryoko." Ayeka then walked over to her closet, selected a long 
blue kimono, put it on, and began brushing her hair.
	"No undergarments, Princess?"
	"They are forbidden on Jurai. Plus, I've heard that they can be extremely 
uncomfortable."
	"I heard the same thing. I'd rather have on just one layer of clothing." 
She then silently moved over to Ayeka and cupped her breasts, suprising the 
violet-haired woman. "Plus, it provides easier access to 'certain' parts of the 
body."
	"You know, Ryoko," Ayeka began, "it would be a shame if we could not 
experience sex with each other again."
	"Are you saying you want to keep me as your lover, Princess?"
	"Yes. It's just too good a feeling to pass up."
	"And what if Tenchi eventually chooses one of us?" Ryoko asked.
	"Well, then, I see no reason to stop seeing one another. I mean, Lord 
Tenchi would be glad to see the two of us getting along so well." Then, with an 
evil gleam in her eye, she added, "And maybe we can invite him to join us now 
and then."
	"I never knew you were such a pervert, Ayeka." She kissed Ayeka's neck 
before adding. "And it makes me love you even more."
	"After today, I can believe that I Iove you as well, Ryoko."
	"Do you think Sasami would mind if you and I spent tonight out in the 
forest? I'll supply the tent."
	"She won't mind as long as we're civil to one another. But, if you're 
supplying the tent," she reahed into her dresser and pulled out a rather large 
grey case. "I'm supplying the entertainment."
	"What's in that thing, Ayeka?" Ryoko asked.
	"Some magazines I managed to get from Nobuyuki, as well as 
certain....'objects' I believe you'll enjoy."
	Ryoko was almost drooling in anticipation. "Do any of them....I 
mean....well..." she trailed off, trying to search for the word.
	Ayeka giggled. "Yes, Ryoko, a good number of them do vibrate."
	Ryoko smiled and said, "I can't wait for nightfall."
	"Neither can I, my love. Neither can I." With that, Ayeka turned around 
and kissed Ryoko, both of them confident that, no matter what else happened, 
they would always have each other.
