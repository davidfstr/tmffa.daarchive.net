Author's Notes: The LAST Part...........
Well it's been a long time. In the past few months, College, my brother,
and my PIECE OF SHIT COMPUTER have all caused me to put this thing on hold
for a while. It is
now May and I haven't touched the fic since January... Here it is. After
reformatting my computer, getting a new A drive (that my brother broke), and
college coming to
finals time, I now have enough time to get to what I want to do... WRITE MY
FIC!!!
I have had some hard times the past few months so some of what goes on in
the fic will have
probably been influenced by what has happened.
Here is what you can expect: Everyone fights Kagato... What Mike asked Washu
for
in part 2... and MUCH MUCH MORE.... JUST READ THIS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU
THINK... PLEASE... AND
THANK YOU!!!!

                              The West Meets The East: No Need for The West
                                            (Last Part)
                                        By: Universal Escape

<GOD DAMN!!!> Thought Mike. <WHY COULDN'T THERE BE TELEPORTERS LIKE IN STAR
TREK?>  "It's been

two weeks since Kagato took Ryoko and we still aren't anywhere near
Jurai?!?"  (In case you are

wondering... Kagato challenged Tenchi and Crew to come to Jurai and fight. I
forgot to put that

in part 2) Mike said to himself. Washu was in the co-pilots seat...
asleep... or so Mike thought.

                                     * * * * * * *
"This chair is so uncomfortable, I'm about to rip it from the floor!"  Mike
said aloud and annoyed.

"Then why don't you get some rest my son?"  Washu said suddenly.  "The ship
does have Auto Pilot."

"And after all... we are about a day away from reaching Jurai."   Washu said
with a yawn.

"Why the hell didn't you say anything before?!?!?"   Mike practically
yelled.   "Because...

You didn't ask."   "Whatever. I'm going to take a nap or two or three. Wake
me if I'm not up already

when we get there."

                                     * * * * * * *
The ship was huge. Mike was walking for what seemed like 10 minutes already
to his room. He

started thinking. What if he was killed? What if someone else was killed?
What if.....?

The thought trailed off in his mind. He passed Ayeka and Sasami's room and
peeked in to check

up on the two lovely princesses. He entered the room and saw that they were
both asleep. He

noticed that Sasami was in the same bed as Ayeka and suspected she had a
nightmare.

He walked to Ayeka's side of the bed and stopped. He stared at the beauty
that was before him.

At the moment he just wanted to stay there and stare at her forever. He knew
that the battle

with Kagato would not be too far ahead.. so he leaned over and kissed Ayeka
on the forehead and

left to go to his room.

                                     * * * * * * *
Mike had just gotten about 3 hours of sleep when he was awoke by Ayeka and
Sasami. Ayeka wanted

to be with Mike before the fight and Sasami wanted to stay with her, because
she had a bad dream,

so they came to an agreement. Sasami could come along with Ayeka as long as
Sasami didn't stay

too close to Ayeka while she was with Mike in bed (NO SEX IN THIS ONE....
SORRY). But

Sasami had another bad dream and crawled into the bed on the other side of
Mike. She

felt safer than ever knowing that her sister and Mike were there to protect
her. When Mike

awoke and found he had another lovely princess in his bed with her arm on
his chest...

all he could do was sigh and put his arms around them, hold them close and
comfort them both.

                                     * * * * * * *
When they reached Jurai, Washu told everyone that they had arrived over the
speaker system.

They were finally there... but they didn't know what to expect. Tenchi was
leading the group.

Mike was speechless... he had never seen such beautiful architecture... and
a whole shitload

of trees. They were walking for about an hour when suddenly Tenchi saw two
rows of

knight looking guys lined up right before two huge doors. Ayeka and Sasami
knew it was the

throne room.

                                     * * * * * * *
When the group started towards the doors, the knights moved their staffs as
if they were

saluting them. The group keeps walking towards the knights. Out of nowhere,
all the knights

(about 18 of em) are attacking them. But they were weak... nothing like the
battle with Kagato.

Tenchi with his sword (not the light hawk sword... yet) and Ayeka with her
shield, the knights

went down like bricks.

                                     * * * * * * *
The only thing between Tenchi and Co. and Kagato were the huge doors leading
to the throne room.

It took Tenchi and Mike about two minutes to push the heavy doors open.
Inside, Kagato was sitting

on the throne with a very big and evil grin on his face with Ryoko in a very
strong capsule.

"Welcome. It's been so long I was beginning to think you pussied out!"
Kagato said to Tenchi.

"You dare to take MY Ryoko... and talk like your some kind of god... and
think nothing will

happen to you unlike last time?"   Tenchi yelled.

                                     * * * * * * *
Kagato, who seemed a bit arrogant, got up from his throne, and proceeded to
walk towards the

group. Kagato saw everyone he had expected... but Mike was nowhere to be
seen. He had slipped

into the shadows of the room and kept himself hidden.

                                     * * * * * * *
<So that's the fucker who kidnapped Ryoko, huh?>   Mike thought to himself.
<Well his ass is going

down!>  Mike watched from the shadows as everyone got the fight on with
Kagato. He was much

more powerful this time around. Tenchi, Ayeka, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Washu
were all doing their

best to overtake the Evil Bastard. All the while they were wondering what
happened to Mike.

He was nowhere to be found.

                                     * * * * * * *
The first to go down (no they did not die) was Mihoshi.  <Damn. That had to
hurt.>  thought Mike

The second to go down was Washu  <You OK MOM?>  Mike spoke to his mom in her
mind.  <Yes... but

what the hell are you doing? Why are you hiding?>  Washu asked Mike
telepathically.  <You'll see.>

Next to go down was Kiyone.  <Ooh. Well at least she went down fighting.>
Ayeka still kept a good

fight but went down eventually.  <SHE'S OK SHE'S OK. SHE BETTER BE OK.
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO

HER ILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.... OR KAGATO FOR THAT MATTER.>  and last but
definity not least

Tenchi.

                                     * * * * * * *
Tenchi was the last one left so he called upon the Light hawk Wings and
fought Kagato for about

a minute with the Light hawk Sword. But Kagato was more evil and the Light
hawk Sword was

worthless and eventually Tenchi went down in a heap from exhaustion and
pain.

                                     * * * * * * *
"Looks like I've won. How unfortunate for you Ryoko, you only get to spend a
few hours with

your boyfriend. Pity I have to kill him now."  Kagato said with all the
arrogance the world could

have.  "Oh really?"  came a voice Kagato had never heard before.  "I guess
you never noticed me or

thought they were alone"  said Mike.  "Who.... are you?"  asks Kagato, not
knowing what to expect.

"I'm the one who will take your ass out mother fucker! Trust me your sorry
ass is going down."

said a really pissed off Mike.  "..... You don't seem to know my powers-"
"I could care less about

your powers, dumb fuck. Where I'm from no one has powers, but they do know
how to defend

themselves, and I could take you out in no time."   Mike said with
confidence.   "Try me."   Said

Kagato.   "Gladly you fucking shit faced wonder who cant tell his face from
his ass."  Said Mike

Kagato was walking towards Mike with everyone else watching in shock.

                                     * * * * * * *
Just then Mike had a red light coming from his body. Mike started to scream
bloody murder

and a sword appeared kind of like the Light hawk sword but had a red blade
and a black handle.

Kagato took a step back and looked on in disbelief. Kagato called forth his
own sword.

                                     * * * * * * *
Kagato and Mike just looked at each other waiting for the other to make a
move.  <To hell with

this, I'll just kill him and get him out of the way.>  thought Kagato as he
started to make his

way towards Mike. Mike saw this and charged Kagato as well.  Mike and Kagato
fought with such

force that the whole throne room shook slightly.  <FUCK FUCK FUCK. This
fucker is good.>  they both

thought.

                                     * * * * * * *
After about two minutes of fighting both Kagato and Mike took a few steps
back and took a moment

to breathe. They charged again and swung with all their energy this time
Mike's sword went

through Kagato's upper torso in a spray of blood. Kagato stood their holding
his chest and fell

to his knees.   "THAT LITTLE FUCKER DID IT. HE DEFEAAAaaaa..."   was all
that Kagato could

say as he fell to the floor dead.

                                     * * * * * * *
"Eat Shit you flying fuck." said Mike, the sword disappearing. Tenchi took
this time to release

Ryoko. Everyone walked over to Mike with their eyes practically popping out
of their heads from

seeing someone like Mike kill Kagato.

                                     * * * * * * *
Suddenly Mike felt a twinge of pain in his chest and looked down. He had
been cut deeply.

He collapsed to the ground from the pain. Everyone rushed over to him and
Washu pulled

up her holo-lap-top and connected some wires and an IV to Mike. Ayeka was
kneeling and put

Mike's head in her lap and tried to comfort him. Mike was shaking and
breathing hard.

Surprisingly calm, Mike asked Washu how long it would be until he would be
up and about again.

But Washu could only let out a yell of pain as if she herself was cut.
"The cut is too deep...

There is nothing I can do..."   she said with tears going down her face like
rivers.   "Mom...

I know you like to kid and all... but that shit aint funny!!!"   Mike said.
"Look at these tears...

do I look.... like I'm kidding?"   Washu said between sobs.   "I'm only 19
fucking years old...

You can't do anything?!?"   "No, I cannot."

                                     * * * * * * *
Breathing hard, Mike told everyone that he felt a bond with everyone of
them. But with Ayeka

he felt the strongest.   "I will always love... you Ayeka... FOREVER!!! You
are my BEST friend

and I will never forget anything that has... happened between all of us.
This was the

greatest vacation.... I have ever had in my life.............. as short as
it was. Thank you

for everything.

Mike held Ayeka close and kissed her on the lips as he felt life leaving
him.   "I'm glad Ryoko

is ok. Tenchi, you take.... care of her. She.... needs your love. Ryoko...
take care... of him

as well... Mihoshi and Kiyone... we have had some memories... together...
and I hope you get

your promotions... you sure... have been deserving of them for some.....
time now. Sasami...

some day you.........will be a beutiful princess... but until... then...
keep... up the

Awesome cooking and just be yourself. Washu and Ayeka.... You are in my....
heart and I will..

..... always be

in your hearts... and I'll be up there.... watching over all of you
and........ making sure....

you don't get into....... any.... trouble... I LOVE YOU ALL............"
Mike said as life left

him.   "Goodbye my friends."
