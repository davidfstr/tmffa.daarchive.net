                   Washu's Revenge                 by: Valie

"Shimatta Ryoko!," an angry Washu shouted in her lab.

Ever since Ryoko's failed attempts to get Tenchi through Nobiyuki's 
romance books, she's been driving Washu crazy. Not physically crazy
but mentally. It started a few days after the whole romance books thing...

**********
Washu was sitting in her lab working on another creation when she 
decided to peek into her daughter's mind. She noticed that Ryoko had 
been eyeing Aeka more than usual. And it wasn't in a bad way, it was
more of a sexual desire way.

Washu quickly dismissed the idea that Ryoko liked Aeka, but it was
never far from her mind. On this particular day, she could tell that her 
daughter was up to something. But what exactly she wasn't sure because
Ryoko had managed to hide it in her mind.

Some time later Washu was in the middle of perfecting her creation when 
she heard Ryoko telepathically talking to her. 

"I know you can hear me Washu. And I just wanted to let you know that,
I want you to keep out of my head for the rest of the day."
"Why? What are you planning to do?," Washu asked mentally.
"You mean who am I'm planning to do," Ryoko corrected.
"Huh? But Tenchi isn't even home."
"I know, but Aeka is..."
"You don't mean?"
"Oh yeah. I mean look at that body... Gotta go. Opportunity has just shown
itself," Ryoko said.

Washu was stunned by what her daughter had just told her. She didn't
believe Ryoko...at first. She shrugged it off and went back to her work.
A few moments later she heard something rather disturbing to her.

"Oh Aeka!," Ryoko mentally thought, unaware that her mother could
hear her.

Ryoko's head filled with ecchi thoughts of her and Aeka. Washu couldn't
do anything but listen to what was going on in Ryoko's head. Washu was
forced to mentally watch her daughter have sex with Aeka...

Weeks later, Washu had finally had enough. So she planned her revenge.
She smiled devilishly as she thought of her plan and decided to execute it the 
next day.

**********
"Aeka will you please assist me in my lab after breakfast?," Washu asked.
"Um...you want me to assist you? I was planning to do something today," she 
said giving Ryoko a side glance.
"Please? Oh pretty please?," Little Washu asked in her most child like voice.
"Oh all right, Miss Washu."
"Oh thank you!," Washu said still using her child-like voice.

After breakfast, Washu led Aeka to her lab paying no mind to her daughter
who gave her a dirty look. Once inside, Washu locked the door and guided 
the princess to a hidden area of her lab where she usually did her experiments
on poor Tenchi.

"Um...what do you need me to assist you with?," Aeka asked.
"With some of my experments silly."
"But I thought Tenchi was your guniea pig."
"He still is but I need to compare some of his data to your data."

Washu pushed some buttons on her computer and a metal bed popped out of 
nowhere. Aeka jumped back as the bed almost landed on her. 

"Hey watch it!," the princess shouted.
"Sorry," Washu said innocently.
"Now what?," Aeka asked impatiently.

Washu smiled to herself.

"Remove your clothes and sit down."
"What?!"
"Are you going deaf over there? I said remove your clothes and sit down."
"All my clothes?"
"No. You may leave your underclothes on," Washu said becoming impatient.

Aeka relunctantly removed her clothes and sat on the cold metal. She looked 
down at the metal and when she looked back at the pink hair girl, she saw a pink 
hair woman.

"Washu...?"
"Of course! Now let's get started," the now older Washu said moving towards 
the princess.

She stopped inches away from the purple-haired woman. So close that Aeka
could smell a sweet smell coming from her. Washu looked into the princess' eyes
and lowered herself so she was exactly face to face with the sitting woman.

"Washu what are you up to...?," Aeka asked finding herself feeling extremely
attracted to the scientist.

Washu smiled and leaned forward and caught Aeka's lips with her own.

*Revenge* Washu telepathically thought to Ryoko.
"Huh?," the sleeping demon said looking around.

Ryoko shrugged and fell back to sleep unaware of her mother's intentions.

Back in the lab, Washu pulled back from the surprised princess. She smiled
and stood up, pulling Aeka to her feet. She kissed her again, and slpped her
hands along Aeka's bare stomach.

"Mmm...Washu...please don't...," she tried to protest but found herself really 
enjoying what was happening.

Washu moved the kissing down the purple-haired woman's neck, moving
down to her breasts. 

"We must get rid of this," Washu said slipping off Aeka's bra.

She gently kissed the erect nipples and took the right one into her mouth,
causing soft moans to escape the princess' throat. She slipped her right hand
into Aeka's panties and pushed her way pass her nether lips. She slipped a
finger into her, causing Aeka to moan loudly. She slipped another in and moved
them in and out. Aeka buckled and would've fell to the floor if Washu hadn't 
been
holding her up with her free hand. Aeka moans increased as the genius moved her 
hand faster and switched to the other nipple. Aeka finally orgasmed and came
soaking her panties as well as Washu's hand.

"My, my. You really seemed to enjoy that, huh?," Washu asked before licking her
hand clean.

Aeka could only nod slightly as she took a seat on the metal bed. Washu smiled
and stood up. She kissed the eager woman and felt hands along her back, pulling
her closer. She let the princess undress her slowly. Once she was undressed, 
Aeka
made the genius sit down. Washu wondered what she was up to and as if on cue,
Aeka kneeled in front of her and pushed her legs apart. She moved her head in
between the pink-haired woman's legs. She licked the slit of her entrance and 
heard
Washu gasp loudly. Now it was Aeka's turn to smile as she used two fingers to 
open the scientist's nether lips. She licked the nub that was there and then 
took it in her mouth and sucked on it. At the same time she moved her hands up 
to Washu's
breasts and massaged them gently. The genius buckled under the princess' mouth. 
She moaned loudly and thrusted her hips against Aeka's mouth. She rose to her
climax quickly and felt nothing but bliss in her head. She finally came and Aeka 
licked up the juices hungerily. She stood up and kissed the heavily panting 
genius.

"Where did you learn to do that?," Washu asked a little later on.
"Well a princess has to get out from time to time," Aeka said blushing.
"I see."
"Do you promise not to tell Ryoko?"
"Of course. You think I want to get killed by my own daughter?," Washu said with 
a laugh.

Aeka giggled and kissed Washu softly before falling asleep. Washu smiled.

*I should do this revenge thing more often* she thought silently to herself and 
fell asleep.

                               ***The End***

Author's Note: Yeah, I know it doesn't have much of a plot. But it was still 
worth writing. I give some credit to Chibiangel55 for giving me the idea for the 
pairing between
Aeka and Washu. I hope you enjoyed this short little fic. Let me know what you
