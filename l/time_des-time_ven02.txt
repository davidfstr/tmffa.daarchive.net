Well, I think Part One went well, but I would still
like plenty of C&C on it, as well as on this part.  I
would REALLY like to see an MST of my work, just to
see if it is received well by readers.  Thanks in
advance: Evan “Paladin” Ulven

Standard DisclaimerJ
        Tenchi, and all characters made under that series are
property of Pioneer and AIC, I am only borrowing them,
and plan to give them back when I’m finished.  I know
neither of those companies will sue me for writing
this, unless I make money off it, and I won’t.  So no
need to worry, just read and enjoy!

Warnings:
        It is possible that a bit of Lemon may appear later
on in this fic, I will try to avoid all-out sex, and
hope, that at the worst it is strong Lime.  I don’t
know, since I am making this up as I go.
        I may take some names from other Anime shows/movies,
I’m none too good at Japanese, and I don’t want a
stupid sounding name ruining my fic, so I’ll be taking
just names, not the characters.
        Also, this is an AU/SI of sorts, though the character
based on me is hardly god-like and is perfectly
capable of being killed off by yours truly, he will
not be the main character, and is only there for some
flavor.  As for the AU part, this takes place about 15
years after the end of the series.

SHINJI AND ASUKA FOREVER!!!
…..woah, where’d THAT come from.  I’m also an Eva fan,
but I don’t have enough money to get all the DVD’S
yet.

Time For Destruction, Time For Vengeance

*A few advance notes here.  The timeline I had worked
out for this fic was very rapid, so I’m going to try
and drag it out a bit to make the story flow better.
At the beginning of this part, it has been 1 year
since the end of Part one. (Sorry! But this space is
needed to make the fic read right)
*End advance notes

        Sasami watched with a contented look on her face as
she observed her husband playing with their two
children.  With the birth of Shinji and Miriya, their
lives had changed drastically, first, Sasami had to
deal with two children instead of one, she still
remembered the look of shock, love and pride on her
husbands face when they found out they were having
twins.  The fact that neither of them wanted to look
at any of the ultrasound scans had made it so the
gender of the child would be a complete surprise, but
neither of them had expected twins, let alone a son,
AND a daughter, making them use both of the name they
had agreed on for their progeny.
        Both Shinji and Miriya were walking now, well,
waddling anyway, it was absolutely adorable to watch
them scamper to their fathers open arms as he came
home from a conference meeting with USMC command.
“DADA, DADA!” spoke the two toddlers as the both of
them made a beeline from their toys to the front door
of the house.
“Hey! How’s my little angels?” “Were you both good
today?”
        Sasami out down the carving knife she was using to
chop vegetables, wiped her hands on a towel, and
walked into the entryway.
She had a loving smile as she spoke. “They were
absolutely perfect” “Neither one of them made a fuss
all day.”
        Alex put down the children then embraced his wife and
gave her a small kiss.
“That’s great to hear.” “So, how was your day?”
“Pretty good, actually.  I asked Tenchi and Ryoko if
they could watch the kids so I could get a few things
done in town, and I managed to get a few things that
we needed.”
“Sorry I missed them, I’ve been meaning to ask Ryoko a
few things.”
        Sasami got a questioning look on her face.
“Like what?”
“Mainly to know if there are any non-legit groups on
or near Earth that might cause some problems.”
“Why not ask me?”
“I didn’t think you would know about pirates, outlaws
and other people that need to be avoided.”
“That makes sense, Ryoko would be the one to ask about
that.  All I can say is that GP and Juraian Patrols
routinely go through the area just beyond mars orbit
to look for illegal transgressors.” “Ever since the
Mars colony became operational, the patrols have
probably moved their range to either inside or just
beyond the asteroid belt.”
“Why so far out?”
        Sasami smiled at her husband.
“To avoid detection, of course.”
        Alex winced, then looked at Sasami with a sorrowful
gaze.
“Alex, whats wrong?”
“We need to talk. Now.”
        Sasami detected the urgency in her husbands’ voice,
and moved toward the children.
“Time for a nap you two.”
        She then took Shinji and Miriya to their room, and
tucked them in for their afternoon nap.
        Alex took a deep breath, then, after a brief pause,
began to speak.
“That meeting I was at with USMC command.  Well, its
wasn’t just the command staff, the joint chiefs were
there as well as the Presidential advisors for
biological containment.”
        Sasami looked extremely confused.
“What? Why?”
        Alex took another deep breath.
“Well, when we were at the hospital for the kids
birth, the med-staff followed standard procedures.
Before they could give you any painkillers they had to
know if you were allergic to any of them, or if the
kids were,so they took a blood sample to look for any
negative reaction to he Epidural.”
        Sasami’s face went pale; she knew where this was
heading.
“Well, as they scanned the sample, the doctors noticed
some bacterium that they had never seen before, as
well as some foreign vitamins, minerals and other
biological chemicals.”  “Then they did a blood type
test, to determine your blood type, and the sample
showed the type wasn’t even on record.  So they
followed up with a DNA scan, and found more chemicals
that just don’t appear in any other Terrans DNA
structure.”
        Sasami was even paler now.  Her next sentence was
spoken nervously.
“Does that mean…” She trailed off.
        Alex looked her directly in the eyes.
“Yes, Sasami, they know that you are not of this
world.”
        Sasami suddenly felt almost sick, the thing she was
to keep secret from the people of this world was out.
The Terrans knew there was an alien and two hybrid
children living on their planet, and even worse, the
most powerful military force were the only ones who
had that information.
        Sasami’s voice was low and stuttering when she spoke
next.
“What…What else do they know?”
        Alex sighed and looked somewhat ashamed.
“Everything Sasami, everything you told me, I told
them everything.  I had to, if command found out I was
lying under oath in a military inquiry, I could be
either to 25 years in Leavenworth, or be shot in a
firing squad.  And I didn’t want you to go through
life as a widow.”
        Deep inside her mind, Sasami felt a brief flare of
anger, but it was quickly suppressed, she couldn’t
blame Alex for giving that information, under the
pressure of a Marine inquiry, even her sister would
have probably broken.  And even Sasami knew just how
unforgiving and uncaring Earths military was, the
Marines more that most.
        “So what happens now?” She asked.
        “Well, there are several things.”
        “One, stay here and act as if nothings happened,
which I don’t recommend, since as I left the inquiry I
heard mumblings of ‘capture’ and ‘study’.”
        “Two, go hide out with Tenchi and Ryoko.”
The next sentence Alex spoke was rather nervous.
        “Or three…Go the Jurai.”
Sasami gasped at the last option, going to Jurai would
put Alex in even more danger that she was in here.
Sure she could be ‘captured’ and ‘studied’.  But at
Jurai, Alex could very well be killed for marrying her
without the consent of her father, let alone raising a
family.  Her mother and aunt had fully backed the
wedding, but her father had remained unmoved but any
of their protests, and would still not consent even
after meeting Alex.  Even after he was accepted by
Tsunami to drink the life water of her tree, thus
making him as unaging as Sasami, her father would
still not consent to the ‘Primitive Savage’ marrying
her.  And now her beloved was talking of going
directly to the place where he would probably be
imprisoned and executed, just to ensure the safety of
her and the children.  Sasami now had tears in her
eyes as she spoke.
“How could we do that?” she cried.
“You’d be killed almost as soon as you touched the
planet surface, what were you saying earlier of not
wanting me to be a widow?”
        Alex winced at that comment, and Sasami immediately
knew what she had said had hit home, and she felt a
pang of guilt for having said it.
        “I’m sorry Alex, I didn’t mean to say that.”
        “Its all right Sasami, what you said was true, I
guess we’ll have to think of something else.”
        “Well” She mused. “We COULD go to Tenchi and Ryoko,
perhaps Washu could help out somehow.”
        “Your right that would work!”  “But… I don’t want to
put Tenchi and the others in danger.  I’m willing to
bet I’ve had a spotter on me ever since I left the
base, and we really don’t want to lead my superiors to
the others do we?”
        Sasami pondered this for a few seconds, then her eyes
brightened as she hit upon an idea.
        “Alex, I just noticed that I’ve never shown you the
bridge of Tsunami, have I?”
        “No, you haven’t, but what does this have to do with
anything?”
        “I can have Tsunami teleport us to the ship, then
send us directly to Tenchi and Ryoko’s house, and the
spotters wont even know we’d have left.”
        Alex had a stunned and amused look to his face now,
much better that the nervous, worried look he had
earlier.
        “Sasami, you’re a genius!”  He leaned forward and
gave her a deep kiss.  “That plan is brilliant!”  “But
what will we do then?”
        Sasami smiled brightly.
        “One step at a time, my love.”

Being teleported, Alex, thought was one of the
strangest sensations he had ever felt.  It sort of
felt like his entire body had been carbonated, a
strange tingling feeling that started at his feet and
worked its way up to his head.  It wasn’t a bad
sensation, just…unusual.
“That…felt rather weird.”
Sasami looked at him strangely.
“Wha…oh, I forgot. First time for teleportation?”
“Yeah, rather interesting feeling isn’t it?”
“I guess, I’ve done it so much that I never notice it
anymore.”  “How are the kids?”
Words were not needed as the laughter coming from the
two 1 year olds as they tried to chase each other
around their father’s legs clearly showed that they
were more than fine.
Alex smiled warmly at the children.
“Pretty good I guess.”
        Sasami gave off a small silvery peal of laughter as
the two children suddenly locked onto their father’s
legs as he stared walking, making him carry them along
as he walked.
“Well” She said “Lets get that cal to Ryoko.”
Alex had a slightly worried expression on his face.
“Are you sure that the message cant be intercepted?”
Sasami just gave him a serious look.
“By the technology on this planet, no.”
Sasami then typed in where she wanted the subspace
call to be sent, and moments later, a small hologram
of Ryoko appeared, beginning the real-time
holo-communication.
Ryoko had obviously mellowed some from before the time
she had married Tenchi, before, she would always wear
extremely revealing clothes of wild, bright colors.
But now, she was wearing plain khaki day slacks, and a
tight-fitting white top.  The look gave a more mature,
professional, and motherly look than before.  But
Ryoko still had that mischievous, fun-loving glint to
her eyes that only she was capable of, a kind of wide
wonderlusted look, that, combined with a look of
contrived innocence, seem to capture the attention of
everyone that beheld her perfect form.

*Authors Note:
As you can probably see, I’m a big Ryoko fan, I’m no
AHRLI, but I am a great fan.  But my favorite Tenchi
character is still Kioyne, and she will be making an
appearance later on, along with everyone’s favorite
blonde airhead
*End Authors note

“Sasami!” Ryoko said wit ha note of surprise “Its been
a long time since you called last, what’s going on?”
“Well, Ryoko…”
“Wait.” Ryoko interrupted, “Hold on a moment”
“Tenchi!” Ryoko called off to the side “Pick up, its
Sasami!”
“What?! Sasami! Ill be right there!” came the reply
from off-projector.
A few moments later, Tenchi appears on the Holonet.
The last few years have been kind to Tenchi. His final
growth spurt, just before he turned 18, made him about
as tall as Ryoko, he had put on more muscle, and the
years of martial arts training and working hard in the
carrot fields had toned his body. Years of constantly
working hard had tightly wrapped his muscles, so while
he was noticeably bigger, he still had a agile,
athletic build to him, and that, combined with a
slightly bronze cast to his skin color from being in
the sun almost constantly, made him look particularly
appealing to the female eye.  He had obviously been
working in the fields in the heat of the June
afternoon as he was still stripped to the waist, was
still slightly dusted with dirt and only wore a pair
of stained and slightly torn khaki work shorts.
Tenchi had a large smile on his face as he began to
talk.
“Sasami, Alex, its been too long, how are you?”  He
greeted them warmly. “Please forgive my appearance, I
wanted to get here as soon as I could.”
“You wont be getting any protests from me, Tenchi”
Ryoko called seductively.
Sasami and Alex laughed together.
“Haha, Ryoko, you will never change, will you” Said
Alex.
“I don’t plan to”
“I certainly hope she doesn’t” Tenchi stated, “I like
her as she is”
Ryoko then, still smiling, looked back to Sasami.
“So what’s up?”
“Ryoko” Sasami sighed sadly “I wish I could say this
is was a social call to catch up on old times”
Ryoko’s and Tenchi’s expression suddenly turn serious.

“What’s wrong?” They both speak simultaneously.
Sasami took a deep breath before speaking.
“Let me tell you”
Sasami then went on to tell Tenchi and Ryoko of what
had happen at the base in Okinawa, the data gathered
by the doctors at the hospital, the military inquiry,
what would have happened to Alex if he hadn’t told all
the story, and what she and Alex had planned to do.
By the end of Sasami’s statements, both Ryoko and
Tenchi had worried and shocked expressions.
“I cant believe the US is willing to go this far.”
Tenchi said “What are they thinking?”
“Only of their own advancement” Stated Alex “That’s
all they care about”
Ryoko then spoke up.
“But if they did anything to Sasami it would start an
instellar war!  The Terrans would be rolled over and
either enslaved, extinct, or quarantined!”
“Out of pride I must say that the first two, probably
wouldn’t happen.”  Said Alex.
Ryoko thought on that a moment.
“Okay, Ill give you that one, it would be impossible
to keep Earth in line without ground troops, and
Marines are probably the best damn infantry I’VE ever
seen, that deterrent worked before against Jurai, but,
hopefully it wont come to that.”
“So you want Washu to help?” asked Tenchi.
“Yes” Stated Sasami, “I think she’s the only one who
can”
A smile appeared on Ryoko’s face again.  “Well come
ahead then, nothing on this world could track where
you teleport down.”
Sasami and Alex’s face brightened.
“Thank you.”
“No problem” said Ryoko “And I can guarantee you that
it will take more that a squad of Terran troops to get
past me and Tenchi.”

End Part 2

WOOOOHOOOOO!
I finally finished part2!
Is it any good? I hope so.  I tried to make it longer
and more interesting that Part one.
If you notice, parts one and two develop different
storylines, this is done intentionally, they will be
brought together soon.

Well, I hope you liked it, send me C&C at
max_sterling83@yahoo.com
SOMEONE PLEASE MST THIS THING!!!!!
That’s the best way to see if my fic is any good (in
my view anyway)

Just to reiterate Alex is NOT the SI, he is a
character pulled from my imagination.  Thought I must
say that I like the sound of the name “Sasami
Kernskey”

Part3 coming soon

“Hello, and goodbye, as always.”
