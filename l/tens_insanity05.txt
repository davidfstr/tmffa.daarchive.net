Tenchi's Insanity

Chapter 5: Tenchi's Most Hated

It is nighttime at the Masaki home.  Tenchi was looking at the picture.  
Three girls were missing because he cut them out.  He was proud of what 
he did and felt saner.  As he lay in his bed, he was thinking.  
Wondering you'll be the next to go.  He hated them all.  But the next 
kill will be the one he hates the most.  The only question was who?  In 
his mind he decided on Ryoko or Ayeka.  Who did he hate more?  It was a 
hard question and one he had to sleep on.  Because in the morning.  One 
of the girls will be asleep. permanently.

At the girls' rooms, they were preparing to go to bed.  Washu was doing 
some last minute work.  She was checking on the girls and Tenchi.  But 
she only could get a lock on the girls in her house.
"That's odd," Washu said. "I can't see what Tenchi or Sasami are 
doing."
She tried harder.  But harder she tried, the more difficult it became.  
Washu knew what it was.  She was just tired.  She turned off the 
computer and walked to bed.  In the morning, she decided to work 
harder.
In the next room of Mihoshi.  She had had bottles littering her room.  
The sent of alcohol fill the room.  Clearly she was drunk.  Very drunk.  
She was babbling in a haft daze.  She was also completely naked.
"Oh Tenchi.  I love you.  I love you more than anyone else.  And you'll 
soon be mine."
She was spinning wildly.  At is until she stepped on a bottle and fell 
on her bed.  She then sat up, through up, and went to sleep in to own 
vomit.
Kiyone was down the hall.  She was bushing her hair before bed.  As she 
combed, she thought of Tenchi.
"Oh Tenchi.  My light.  My love.  My last hope of sanity," Kiyone said. 
"You are the one to free me from this hell.  You can free me from the 
devil named Mihoshi.  You are mine."
Ayeka was at her bedside.  She was deep in pray.
"Oh my Gods," Ayeka said. "Please take mercy to my little sister.  She 
is young and bold.  I know she is a Jurain to the soul.  But I hope 
that she isn't corrupted beyond the point of no return.  If you do that 
much.  I'll be grateful.  Thank you."
Ryoko was taking a nighttime swim.  She was skinny-dipping.  She felt 
the ice-cold water glide over her pussy and firm, round tits.  She felt 
peaceful and calm.  She dived under and exited from the water in a 
splash.  On shore, Ryoko shook off the water like an animal.  She 
floated to her room thinking.
'That was a fun dip,' Ryoko thought. 'But your touch, Tenchi, will make 
me feel so much too good.  And then you'll pick me.  It'll be something 
that I'll rub into Ayeka's face forever.'
 
The next day came and the girls were waiting for Tenchi.  They had 
enough food to least since Sasami weren't there anymore.  As they 
waited, they decided to make innocent conversation.
"So, who do you think is next?" Washu asked. "But the answer is 
obvious.  It has to be me."
"Not to sound rude," Mihoshi said. "But I want to be next."
"Why can't it be next?" Kiyone said. "I have as much chance as you do."
'Shit for brains.' Kiyone thought.
"I love to say this," Ryoko said. "But I'll be next."
"I think Lord Tenchi would see a princess instead of a pirate," Ayeka 
said. "Especial if the princess is as soft skinned, silky haired, and 
firmed breasted as me, verses a scaly skinned, rough haired, flat 
breasted, asshole, bitch space whore of a pirate namely you."
"You better take that back." Ryoko said with a mega glare.
"I will certainly not, slut." Ayeka said glaring back.
"You're the slut." Ryoko shot back.
"YOU ARE!" Ayeka said.
"YOU ARE!" Ryoko said.
The two glared at each other very violently.  They would have gone into 
a catfight is Tenchi didn't knock.
"I think I'll get it," Mihoshi said scared.
She ran to the door and opened it for Tenchi.
"Oh thank God you're here," Mihoshi said. "Ayeka and Ryoko are about to 
go it this tooth and nail."
"Oh?" Tenchi said.
"But now you can help me stop them." Mihoshi said.
"I have a better idea." Tenchi said with an evil smile.
Lucky for Tenchi Mihoshi was too stupid to see it.  They ran in, as 
Ayeka and Ryoko were just about to fight.  The two stopped as they saw 
Tenchi.
"Lord Tenchi," Ayeka said. "I'm so glad to see you."
"And I you." Tenchi falsely said.
"Time for you next date." Ryoko said.
"I hope they decide soon," Washu said. "I hate to get in the middle of 
Ayeka and Ryoko's catfight."
"Speaking of cats," Kiyone said. "I haven't seen Ryo-Ohki around 
lately."
"She's with Sasami." Tenchi lied and truly.
"Oh.  Good." Kiyone said.
"So," Ryoko said. "Who's next?"
"It should be ether Ayeka or Ryoko," Tenchi said. "But that's a hard 
choice."
The girls were shock, mad and confused.
"Me or Ryoko?" Ayeka said.
"Me or Ayeka? Ryoko said.
Tenchi nodded.
"It's a hard, hard choice." Tenchi said.
"Not as hard as your prick when you see this perfect body." Ryoko said.
"You're the prick." Ayeka mumbled.
Tenchi laughed softly.  He liked Ayeka's humor.
"Thanks to Mihoshi's. timing," Tenchi said. "I know how to pick my next 
girl."
"How?" the girls asked.
"A catfight." Tenchi said.
"WHAT?" the girl yelled.
"Ayeka versus Ryoko," Tenchi said. "Princess versus pirate.  Good 
versus evil."
'A big bitch versus a big slut.' Tenchi added in thought.
"Oh," Ryoko said. "Okay.  Sounds like fun."
"If you like losing." Ayeka said.
"But it has to be good." Tenchi said.
"Meaning?" Mihoshi said.
"I want a fight with you two fighting at the max." Tenchi said.
"Meaning? Mihoshi repeated.
'Bonehead.' Kiyone said.
"I mean I want to see you too fight as you never fought before." Tenchi 
said.
"And the prize is?" Ayeka said.
"To the winner," Tenchi said. "An instant healing and me.  To the 
loser, she will heal slowly.  And be ready for the next day."
Ayeka and Ryoko shared a glance.  Even though they hate each other's 
guts.  They wondered if this was wise.  But they looked at Tenchi.  
With the sent of victory in the air, how could they say no.
"Okay," Ayeka said. "I'll do it.  If it means one on Ryoko."
"In that case," Ryoko said. "I'm in."
"I'll meet you two outside in twenty minutes." Tenchi said leaving.
That didn't leave them much time.  But Tenchi knew one thing.  It was 
twenty minutes longer for them to live.

After the twenty minutes were up, Tenchi and the girls met outside.  
Ayeka walked into view from the left and Ryoko floated from the right.  
As they met, Tenchi waved at them.
"Okay," Tenchi said. "Ayeka and Ryoko listen up.  The rule is to beat 
your foe to a bloody pulp.  Bite, scratch, maim, or gore each other.  
Everything goes but death,"
'That's my job,' Tenchi thought.
"One my signal," Tenchi said rising his hand.
Ayeka growled.  Ryoko snarled.
"Fight."
Ayeka was ready as Ryoko rushed into her.  Ryoko faded out and took 
Ayeka off guard.
"Where did she go?" Ayeka said.
Ryoko faded in behind Ayeka.  Ayeka turned and got a foot to the nose.  
It was a powerful blow.  Ayeka was sent into the floor with her nose 
dripping with blood.  It was a hard blow indeed.  Ayeka got up and 
charged.  She didn't care about her nose.  Because it was the least of 
her problems.  She got in close to Ryoko with a fury of swipes.  Many 
missed but a few struck her skin.  Ryoko laughed.  But it was a laugh 
too soon.  She raised her left arm.  But it started to gush blood.  In 
moments her arm went numb.  The pain of the numbness shocked Ryoko.  
Then she decided to land.  But as she landed, her left leg started to 
act up.  The same thing happened to her leg, as did her arm.  She had a 
sharp pain and it went numb.  Ryoko was shock to say the very least.  
But mostly she was mad.
"How dare you," Ryoko said. "How dare you paralyze my left?"
"When I'm done with you," Ayeka said. "Nothing but you head will be 
alive."
"It won't be needed," Tenchi said. "If you can numb her right arm and 
leg.  It'll be you've won."
Ayeka was overjoyed.  Ryoko wasn't.
'I've got to end this. Quickly.' Ryoko thought.
"I don't care if I don't get Tenchi today," Ryoko said.
The other girls were shocked and surprised.
"But I'll never let you fuck him before me." Ryoko said.
She summoned up all to power.  The ground started to shake because of 
this.
"Now. DIE!" Ryoko yelled firing.
Ryoko's blast was so big and powerful, all the ground below it moved 
out of the way.  It headed to Ayeka it an amazing speed and force.  
Ayeka stood her ground and wept.
"I'm sorry. Lord Tenchi." Ayeka's final saying.
But unknown to the girls, Tenchi fired a strong but too strong force 
field around Ayeka.  The blast hit her and it hurt a hell of a lot.  
But she lived.  Ryoko fainted as Ayeka was caught in an explosion.  The 
explosion was extremely strong.  It knocked over the girls but Tenchi 
used a force field to protect him.  As the girls came too, Ryoko was 
fainted with very little feeling in her body.  You could tell with the 
spirals in her eyes.  Ayeka was down too.  She was losing a lot of 
blood from most parts of her broken body.
"The winner: Ayeka." Tenchi said.
"Ah, fuck." Washu said.
"Crap." Kiyone said.
"I knew it.  It knew it," Mihoshi said. "Pay up, sucka."
Washu and Kiyone gave Mihoshi $50 each because of a small bet.  A bet 
to see who'll win.  Mihoshi's best friend: Dumb ass luck.  Tenchi ran 
to the semi live Ayeka.
"Did. did I win?" Ayeka mutter out.
"Yes you did." Tenchi said.
"Oh. good." Ayeka said.
Tenchi smiled as Ayeka passed out.

Moments later, Ayeka awakened.  She was dazed and very confused.  
Seconds seemed like days.  As she awoke she felt a draft.
"Oh my." she looked down. "OH MY GODS!  I'M NAKED!"
She tried to just up but the pain in her body limited movement.
"Oh what the fuck hit me.?" Ayeka asked.
She looked around the room and saw that she was in an arena.  A cage to 
be more precise.  Ayeka saw a door.  She tried the handle.  But it 
seemed to be stuck.  Or even locked.
"Oh my." Ayeka said.
Next to the door was a laser sword.  Ayeka picked it up and decided to 
use it against the door.  But it did little to no damage.  She tried 
again and again.  Each try was more and more annoying and useless.  
With the laser sword in hand she fell to her knees.
"I'm trapped," she said. "I'll be trapped until someone finds me."
"Or until you die." A second voice said.
"Who's. who's there?" Ayeka asked shakily.
The voice came into view.  Ayeka's glance was turned to joy.  The voice 
was Tenchi.  And he was also naked.
"Lord Tenchi," Ayeka said. "Thank the gods that you're alright,"
She wanted to run to him.  But she remembered what he said.
"Um, Lord Tenchi," Ayeka mumbled. "What did you mean or die?"
Tenchi didn't answer.
"Okay," Ayeka said feeling the chill in the air. "Please answer this.  
Who put as here?  And where is here?"
Tenchi still didn't answer.  A chilled minute passed without a word.  
At least Tenchi spoke.
"The answers are very simple.  Even to a simpleton like Mihoshi," 
Tenchi said. "We are in a caged arena.  I built it with Little Washu's 
Peta Bots.  Of course the Peta size was more my idea then hers."
"Peta?  How small is that?" Ayeka asked.
"10 to the -15th power of an inch," Tenchi said. "But that's beyond the 
point.  The point is that I bought you here."
"For what propose?" Ayeka said.
"Guess?" Tenchi asked.
"The only logical reason.  Is to fight." Ayeka said.
"Bingo." Tenchi said.
"I've got one thing to say," Ayeka said.
Tenchi listened in.
"What those bingo mean?" Ayeka said.
Tenchi fell anime style from the question.
"Ayeka focus!" Tenchi demanded. "I brought you here to fight.  Win.  
And to kill you."
Ayeka was confused.
"Kill me?  On what grounds?" Ayeka said.
"On the grounds of Earth," Tenchi joked.
An anime sweat drop appeared on Ayeka's head.
"The truth is that I want to take out my most hated," said Tenchi. 
"Ironically she is the sister of the one killed yesterday."
"You killed someone yesterday?" Ayeka echoed. "Her sisters must be mad.  
And. And."
It just hit her.  The ugly trust was like an impact of a very large 
moon hitting her alone.
"The roast. It was Sasami. You killed her." Ayeka said.
"If you continue talking like that," Tenchi said. "It may stick.  But 
you have a few moments of life left.  So I don't care."
Ayeka's eyes started to tear.  She was Tenchi's most hated.  Even after 
all the love she gave him.  Ayeka quickly grew mad as hell in the 
matter of nanoseconds.
"You bastard," Ayeka said. "You've killed my little sister."
"Sasami, Ryo-Ohki and Sakuya." Tenchi corrected.
"Their blood. their souls. I will avenge them." Ayeka said.
"Don't make empty treats." Tenchi said.
Ayeka proved to Tenchi it wasn't an empty threat.  With her laser sword 
she charged at Tenchi.  Tenchi quickly formed a sword of his own.  The 
two changed at each other.  Sword collided.  Sparks flew.  As the two 
dueled for their lives.  Swing after swing.  Blow after blow, they went 
at it.  Ayeka hit Tenchi's arm drawing first blood.  Tenchi counter 
with a back swing.   Making a deep gash in Ayeka's back and cutting her 
hair short.  Ayeka screamed in pain.  Blood ran down her back.  Ayeka 
was quick to attack again.  She swung wildly but Tenchi blocked every 
blow.
"It's my turn." Said Tenchi.
He attacked with a fury of blows.  Ayeka blocked a few but most hit.  
She lost feeling in her right arm, lost her left hand and was slashed 
in the leg.  Ayeka was a true Jurain; she didn't know the meaning of 
the words give up.
"Do what you must," Ayeka gasped coughing up blood. "I just want to die 
with honor."
"And so you will." Tenchi said jumping back.
She aimed his sword at Ayeka.
"Doom Kaboom." Tenchi attacked.
He powered up and fired a blast of energy at Ayeka.  Before the blast 
hit Ayeka screamed at the top of her lungs, "Sasami, I'm coming to see 
you again."
The blast hit and made a huge explosion.  All that was left of Ayeka 
was the hand the Tenchi cut off.  Tenchi turned of the arena and put 
the hand into the mini coffin.  He walked to his room singing his new 
song.
"Four girls down, four more to go," Tenchi sang. "And the next, is the 
biggest ho.  Now a dream is about to show.  The next girl is has an IQ 
of so-so."

Tenchi: On the next episode is a special.  This is one everyone will 
love.  It'll be the greatest kill I make.  The unlucky girl is.  Find 
out.  The next episode: The Killer Dream.

This was number 5 of 11.  Now the planet Jurai must look for a new 
princess.  And is Mihoshi smarter than it seems.  I think not.
