A Jump through Time and Space: Chapter 1 - How it started
by Bartzero

***********************************************************************

The day started out bright and cheerful for Mike Kyoto. After having a 
somewhat filling breakfast, Mike gathered his books and left for school. 
To him school was boring. His day at school passed slowly and the only 
time he liked besides getting out of school was lunch. 

*Geez, I wish this would get more exciting* 

Mike was in the middle of his last class of the day. Before he was about 
to dose off from the monotone sound of his teachers voice the bell rang 
that spelled freedom to him. 

" It's about damn time I got out of that place." he muttered to himself. 

Mike hopped into his car and drove home so he could get his homework out 
of the way before doing anything. Upon arriving at home he entered the 
house and proceeded to head upstairs to his room and get on his computer 
to do his homework. 

( In another Dimension)

It was another 5 a.m. day for a certain young man whose life has not been 
normal for the last 7 years. Tenchi Masaki rose from his bed to see the 
sun just peeking above the mountain scene that lay before his eyes. After 
rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he headed for the bathroom to take his 
morning shower and get ready for a day of working in the fields, and 
training with his Grandfather.As Tenchi went downstairs he could smell 
a breakfast made for a king, or a prince in this case.
Upon entering the kitchen he was greeted by Sasami, 

" Good morning Tenchi, here is your breakfast."

" Good morning Sasami, thank you." he greeted as cheerfully as he could still 
being a little groggy from sleep. He soon finished his meal and headed for the 
fields. Finally the rest of the household awoke for the day and came down for 
breakfast. First to arrive on the scene was Sasami's older sister Ayeka or know 
to Ryoko as a plain "Pain in the Ass." Ten minutes later Ryoko floated into the 
room to get some breakfast. No sooner could you ask, Ayeka started in on Ryoko. 

" Well, well, well, look who finally arrived for breakfast", said Ayeka in a 
mock fashion.

" Don't start with me Princess, I don't feel like dealing with you today", shot 
back Ryoko.

The argument continued on and ended up outside. Sasami was getting ready to put 
everything away and rest for a while, when a robot entered the room. 

" I AM HERE TO RECEIVE NOURISHMENT FOR PROFESSOR WASHU." It said in a computer 
like voice.

Sasami was a little surprised by the new addition to the house. But went ahead 
and gathered some food to give to the robot assistant. When finished she gave 
the food to the robot and went to washing the dishes. 

In Washu's lab, Washu was hard at work on a teleportation device. Everywhere you 
looked was invention after invention. Some were so old that they where gathering 
dust. 

" Where is that robot with the food I sent it for?" said an annoyed Washu.

No sooner said than done, she heard the buzz at her door and she pushed a button 
on her semi  transparent laptop. The lab door came open with a swoosh and the 
robot entered the dark and sometimes mysterious lab. It rolled through the lab 
until it got to Washu who was drooling at what Sasami had given the robot 
assistant. A large tray full of food. There was eggs, crisp bacon, lightly 
buttered toast, and a warm cup of green tea. After filling herself with the 
delicious breakfast she went back to finishing her work. 

( The fields )
It was almost lunchtime and Tenchi just finished in the field and was gathering 
his shirt, hoe and food basket so he could head home. It was a peaceful walk 
home along the path he always took. To him the trees always look amazing to him 
when they started to change. Summer was just ending but the weather was still 
hot for that day. But his peaceful walk ended all too soon.

" Oh Tenchiiiii" came a voice out of nowhere but Tenchi knew who it was. He 
practically knew it was coming sooner or later.

" What is it Ryoko?" said a slightly annoyed Tenchi

" I just came out here to join you for a walk home, is that so wrong?"

" Not at all." said a relieved Tenchi

Two things worried Tenchi about this and that is one, Ryoko was going to pull 
one of her attempts to seduce him or two, Ayeka would see them two together and 
explode and get into another fight with Ryoko.

( Washu's lab )
"I'm finally finished with the new and improved tele-porter," said Washu. This 
was not a normal tele-porter like the one she made before. This one can cross 
dimensions, through space and time. 

"I need to test this before I show anyone in the household to see if it works. I 
don't want to put anyone into serious danger. One slip up and who know what will 
come through that tele-porter." 

Washu typed in a sequence of buttons and pressed enter. The tele-porter began 
flashing with a light that was so bright it lit the lab up. Once the light 
dimmed down Washu looked to find a potted plant only found on Juri.

"Excellent it worked," Washu beamed.

Lunch came around and Sasami was finishing setting up the table when Tenchi 
walked in. 
" Sasami is lunch almost done?" asked a very hungry Tenchi. She gave Tenchi her 
usual cheerful smile. 
" Your just in time Tenchi I was just about to go get everyone for lunch." 

" Well Sasami I'm going to wash up, then I will be down for lunch." replied 
Tenchi.

After everyone was gathered for lunch Sasami proceeded with bringing in the 
gourmet meal. The lunch was going just fine but a little quiet so Ayeka decided 
to break the silence.

" So how are the fields today Lord Tenchi?"

" It's doing ok, but it could be better if I could keep Ryo-oki out of the 
carrots."

" Well Ryoko it looks like your rat has been bothering Tenchi and ruining all of 
his hard work." Ayeka smirked.

" Bite me Miss Prissy Pants."

" WHAT DID YOU CALL ME."

" Miss Prissy Pants, you got a problem with it?"

" I'll make you pay for that!"

Ayeka lunged for Ryoko and missed. Ryoko tripped Ayeka and she landed in a bowl 
of Miso soup and Ryoko busted up laughing. Meanwhile Tenchi hid under the table 
to avoid any injury, but Washu steped in and stopped the fighting.

" Alright you two, I have something important to show all of you in my lab. Now 
please follow me."

Everyone that was at the table followed Washu into her lab and watched as she 
unveiled a machine that looked about the size of Azaka and Kamidake and the same 
shape. They all looked on in confusion and wondered what the hell that thing 
was.

" I know you all remember my tele-portation device, well this is a new and 
improved version that can teleport you or anything through time and space into 
another dimension."

The group still didn't know what she meant so Washu decided to show them. Washu 
called upon her semi-transparent laptop and pressed a few buttons and hit enter. 
The tele-porter lit up once again but this time it began to rumble and shake. 
The group was looking scared and Washu didn't know what was going on.

" What the hell is happening!? It worked the first time I tried it!

( Back to Mike Kyoto's world )

As we come back on this scene, Mike is busy with a report that he was given to 
do for history, and is busy on the internet finding information. From site to 
site he went gathering information for his homework and was busy typing his 
report. This had taken him two hours already.
" I need a break and a drink, besides this report is not due for three days." He 
got up to get a drink and went the kitchen. Mike grabbed himself a cold Dr. 
Pepper and headed back to his room. When he reached the door to his room he 
heard strange sounds coming from his room.
*I know I didn't turn my tv on, what's going on in there?* His question was 
answered when he opened his door.

"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?"

His bedroom wall had become a swirling vortex. Paper, pencils and all kinds of 
other things were being thrown around the room. But it was starting to suck him 
in to and it only became worse. He gripped one side of the doorway and the 
handle to his door to keep from being sucked into the vortex. The suction of the 
vortex got stronger and Mike couldn't hold on anymore and he was sucked in. When 
he hit the vortex all he could see was flashing lights of various colors, but 
then there was darkness and he passed out. 

( Back in Tenchi's World )
Washu was waiting to see what would happen. All of the others took hiding behind 
some of Washu's other experiments. Her invention was still emitting light but 
had quit shaking, they all waited to see what going to come out of the 
teleporter. Soon the light died down and to their surprise they saw a person 
laying unconscious on the floor. Tenchi and Ryoko went to help the person out of 
the teleporter while Washu checked to see what went wrong. While Washu was busy 
Tenchi and Ryodo carried the young man to the couch in the living room. The 
young man was about Tenchi's age, he has dark brown almost black hair, with a 
slight tan, and a small build. He is wearing a blue T-shirt and baggy jeans, and 
he stood 5' 9". Sasami had ran off to get a wet rag to put on his head.

Three hours had passed by when he finally started to wake. His vision was a 
little blurry at first and the lights in the room made him have to squint his 
eyes. He could feel the coldness of the cloth that was on his head and wondered 
where he was at. When he looked around the first thing he saw was Tenchi and 
Ryoko looking over him. This startled him and he jumped off the couch and backed 
away from the mysterious people.*Where am I?* *I know who these people are.* 
*I've seen them before on a show that I watch, but now they stand here before me 
as if they where real*

"Where am I?" asked the young man.

"You are in the house of the Masaki residents, and my name is Tenchi Masaki. Who 
are you?"

"My name is Mike Kyoto and I know who you people are."

"WHAT!?" asked a confused Ryoko.

"It's a long story, I'll explain later. But how did I get here?"

"I'll answer that"

Everyone turned to see Washu standing in the doorway to her lab.

"Now Mr. Kyoto, you have arrived here through my newest tele-porter by accident 
actually."

"A tele-porter huh? Ok that explains how I got here. By the way everyone just 
call me Mike."

"Hello Mike." greeted everyone.

"Now Mike you said earlier that you knew who we all are, how is that?" inquired 
Ryoko

"Ok this will take a while to understand and it may confuse you all. Here I go"

Everyone sat down in the living room to listen to how Mike knew them all. Indeed 
it was a long story and it did shock everyone.

"Where a cartoon show where you come from?" exclaimed Sasami.

"Yes, a cartoon. In the cartoon it shows how all of you met, the villains that 
you had to face and the good to bad times that you all have had in this house. 
It even shows Tenchi leaving the house and going to school in Tokyo." explained 
Mike Kyoto

"This is freaking me out because I did move out of the house to live in Tokyo so 
I didn't have to commute to school every day. But can you prove this is true?" 
said Tenchi.

"Yes actually. I will go one by one, but there are some things that I know about 
that I cannot tell you or it could ruin things that even I don't know about. 
First off, Tenchi. Your full name as you told me is Tenchi Masaki. From what I 
have seen your life was normal until one day you spoted a falling star or so you 
thought. When it crashed it was nearby and you went to investigate, but what you 
found what not a meteorite, but a space pirate who's name is Ryoko. That is when 
you journey began. You are also part Jurain and Earthling, but you are of the 
Royal Family of Jurai and a prince. Next is Ryoko. You where known as the most 
dangerous space pirate and probably still are. You have had many terrible 
experiences throughout your life in which I will not speak of. You are also 
fighting for the love with the one sitting over on the couch. Princess Ayeka 
crown princess of Jurai and future queen. You lived on Jurai until you decided 
to leave to pursue Ryoko. Then we have your younger sister Princess Sasami. Who 
is also a crown Princess of Jurai. I thank you Sasami for putting that wash 
cloth on my head to keep me cool." Sasami blushes slightly. "Finally last but 
not least the Greatest Scientific Genius in all the Universe, Professer Washu. 
Know for her many inventions. I do remember something about a Sub-space Cannon, 
but I won't go there."

"Well I guess that proves it," Ayeka said 

"You really know alot about us, now what about you?" inquired Washu

"I'm just an ordinary person who spends his days going to school and then coming 
home to do my homework and then I just hang out on the internet and chat with 
online friends I don't really have any friends where I came from except the ones 
I talk to online."

"We'll be your friends," said Tenchi cheerfully. "Right everyone."

"Right!" exclaimed everyone.

"And you can stay here with all of us since you know all of us, oh by the way we 
have two galaxy police officers that come here to visit, they are friends also 
do you know them too?" asked Tenchi.

"Yes! As a matter of fact I do. First Class officer Kyone and Mihoshi." said 
Mike

"Washu could you make a room for Mike to stay in while he is here?" asked Tenchi

"Sure Tenchi. Mike if you will come with me to my lab we can make your room for 
you I just need some information."

Ryoko teleported over to Mike and leaned close and whispered, "Hey Mike you 
might want to watch out and make sure that you don't become one of her test 
subjects."

"I HEARD THAT!" said Washu angrily

"I know what to expect from Washu. She tests everyone that comes into this 
house. She has data on all of you. I don't know how she got it and I don't think 
I want to know. But if she does it will probably be after making my room for me 
to stay in." explained Mike

After that everyone split off to do there own thing Tenchi went to train and 
paid for being late but was forgiven when he explained about the afternoon event 
involving Washu's machine and Mike Kyoto. Sasami went to make Dinner. Ayeka and 
surprisingly Ryoko went and took down the laundry. Now to Washu's lab.

"So Mike what kind of room do you want?"

"What kind?" Mike asked somewhat confused.

"Is there a certain theme that you like for your room or anything added to what 
would be a normal room?"

"Well go ahead and give me a normal room, but here is what I want added."

Mike made his specifications for his room and it was finished by dinner time. 
Mike was in his room checking everything out from the skylite to the computer 
with DSL hookup that didn't cost anything. He even got the bed he asked for.

"Hey Mike it's getting close to suppertime you might want to go wash up and get 
ready."

"Ok, oh by the way. Thanks for the room it's perfect." Mike goes to shake 
Washu's hand but is met with the Adult Washu.

"Why shake hands when we can hug, we are friends after all." So Mike and Washu 
hugged and Mike went to freshen up for dinner. When Mike arrived at the table 
everyone was already there except Washu.

"Washu decided to stay in her lab again, huh?" asked Mike

"Yeah, she usually doesn't come out of her lab to eat supper so I leave her some 
or I usually take her some." answered Sasami a little disappointed that Washu 
didn't make it to Supper.

"Well Sasami, I am going to have some food I am not very hungry right now, but 
when I finish, I will take Washu some food to her for you if you fix her a plate 
for me to take. I want to go thank her once again for the room that she made for 
me."

"Thanks Mike," Sasami said with a bright smile.

Dinner was going just fine until Ryoko started flirting with Tenchi and Ayeka 
noticed. She started turning beat red with anger. Good thing I was finished with 
my dinner and I excused myself from the table.

"Sasami where did you put that food I am to take to Washu?"

"It's in the kitchen. I got most of the food ready all you have to do is pour 
her some Miso soup and take it to her."

"Ok thanks Sasami."

"No problem."

When Mike entered the kitchen he heard Ayeka yell something about "sleazy," and 
"demon bitch." He fixed the Miso soup and left to take it to Washu. He left just 
in time to. He heard explosions and thats all it took for him to hurry to the 
door of Washu's lab. He walked up and pressed the small buzzer next to the door. 
Washu's image appeared in the window of the door to see who it was.

"Oh Mike come on in." The door opened with a swoosh and Mike entered.

"Hello Washu, I have brought you some dinner since you didn't show up."

"Well thank you. look delicious." said Washu before demolishing the entire meal 
in a matter of minutes.

"I also came by to thank you once again for the room and I still need to thank 
Tenchi for letting me stay. I'll tell him tomorrow. Also I want to tell you 
Washu that if you need any help just ask. I might not know much about your 
projects and inventions since I'm in a different Dimension, but I can learn. I'm 
going to find out what I can do around here tomorrow and if there is nothing for 
me to do can I come here and see if you need any help?"

"Sure you can come here tomorrow, and thanks for offering the help."

"No problem that's what friends are for, and maybe we can figure a way to keep 
Mihoshi out of here." Mike chuckled a little

"That's not funny!" said Washu a little annoyed

"Calm down Washu it was a joke. I know what Mihoshi can do that is why I 
suggested to find a way to keep her out." said Mike with a worried look on his 
face. If he didn't watch it he would become another test subject like everyone 
else in the household.

"Well I will see you tomorrow Washu. I'm going to get a shower and then head to 
bed. Goodnight."

"Goodnight Mike"

Mike left the lab and headed up stairs to the bathroom to take a bath. He needed 
to relax for a little while so he could soak up all of what has happened today.

*Wow! This has been quite a day. Better than going to school* As Mike sat and 
soaked he could hear the voices of Ryoko and Ayeka in the womens bath. "Now I 
know how Tenchi's Father feels." He heard splashing and what sounded like 
wrestling, but that was none of his concern. "Oh well." Mike finished with his 
bath put on some shorts and a sleeve less shirt and headed for his room. He had 
Washu put his room right next door to hers, now his room is in a dimension just 
like Washu's. He got in his bed and laid down. Getting to sleep was not coming 
to Mike easy. He laid there watching the stars through the sky light. It wasn't 
too long but sleep finally overcame him and he drifted off into a interesting 
dream.

===============================================================

This is my first fic ever and I decided on Tenchi because it's my favorite 
series next to Dragonball Z but that is beyond the point.

But like I said before I don't own anything related to Tenchi, that is the 
property of the creater of the series and pioneer. But I do own Mike Kyoto 
because I made him up
