Hey everyone,
I read "Kagato's Revenge" (pity me and yourselves as well if you know what
I'm talking about), so this HAS to be done.  Frankly, I'm surprised nobody
did this earlier.  I am including this in the Lemon section simply because
it's predecessor was a lemon.  But it does not actually hold much lemon in
it.  I am using my own character from my X-over series "Pride of a Sai-jin,"
I am not far into it yet so technically I'm getting ahead of myself.  But
this needs to be written before I lose the mood.  This will not affect the
story that I am already writing.

Disclaimer:  I do not own Tenchi Muyo! or it's characters.  Same with Ranma
½.  And I borrowed a little something from DOOM^_^.  Kai is mine, use him
only with my permission.  That should be good enough, ON WITH THE JUSTICE
FIC!!!

 'KAGATO'S REVENGE' ENDS NOW!!!

By Ash Lambert

    Something was wrong at the Masaki house.
    The sun was shining and all seemed peaceful.  The lake shimmered with
light and the house was in one piece.
    But nobody was there.
    "What the heck is going on here?"  Asked a confused Kai.
    "Got me," said Ryouga, "why don't you find their kis?  I'm hungry, so we
have to find Sasami fast!"
    "Yeah, right, like the fate of the universe depends on how full your
stomach is."
    "How'd you know?"
    *face fault*  "I swear, he's turning into that Ranma guy that he's
obsessed with."  Muttered Kai under his breath.
    "Stop interrupting Ryouga, I'm trying to concentrate."
    After a few moments, Kai tracks down the ki forces of his friends.  What
he finds is disturbing.  "That's funny, why are they all in outer space?
Shouldn't they be dead if they were?"
    Ryouga takes a second to absorb this, then he proceeds to knock Kai up
side the head.  "Baka, they are in a ship obviously.  Washu probably wanted
to do some experiments that were too dangerous on earth.  They must have
used
the Yagami."
    "Sorry, but I saw the Yagami in Washu's lab this morning.  It was
trashed
(again)."
    "Well, in any case, we need to get there.  Why don't you use that
instantaneous movement thing you used in our last fight?"
    "Ok, ok, don't get so anxious.  It's not like some evil villain that
should be dead is up there torturing them as we speak you know."
    Grabbing Ryouga's shoulder, Kai proceeded to teleport.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    It came as a shock when they reappeared.  They were closer all right,
but
still so far away for Ryouga.
    "Dang Ryouga, that's the last time I teleport with you!"  Kai managed to
get up a ki shield around them both before Ryouga imploded.
    "(huff) Why'd you teleport us into space baka!  (huff)  Inside the ship
would have been good enough."
    "Well I would have but somehow the transmission was thrown off course.
Would you please explain how that could happen, hmmm?"
    "No comment."  Said an embarrassed Ryouga.  "Could you teleport us
inside
now?  I'd feel a lot safer."
    "No way, I'm not risking it.  We're gonna have to fly close enough to
not
get lost teleporting inside."
    "...quit it already."
    Kai maneuvered the ki bubble to the closest part of the ship.  Searching
inside, he almost missed the closest life force.
    "What the..., that's Sasami!"
    "What about Sasami?"
    "Ryouga, we're gonna have to hurry this up!  Sasami's in trouble, it
feels like someone beat her up real bad!"
    "Then stop telling me and get in there!"  Ryouga exclaimed.  "What kind
of sick freak would hurt Sasami!"
    Ryouga stopped yelling as he realized that Kai had already brought them
from the cold, deadness of space...into a spectacle of sick, unimaginable
cruelty.
    For several seconds, all they could do was stare.

<Please, spare me the wrongness of describing the details.  I do not want to
write it, you do not want to read it again.  Nuff said>

    Ryouga snapped out of it first.  He noticed that a wall had reacted to
their entrance.  Out of it came what seemed hundreds of tentacles, all
bearing various instruments of torture.  Ryouga saw that they meant every
kind of harm imaginable and did the only thing he could think of through the
sheer depression this scene caused.

"SHI SHI HOKUDAN"

The pillar of ki shot up into the ship, destroying everything in the room
and
the three rooms above it.  The tentacles were gone, they remained.  For no
living being in that room had the will to live.
Not Ryouga or Kai, for nobody wants to live in a universe were these things
happen.
And certainly not the poor, tortured body of Sasami.  Although she clung
onto
the last tread of her life, she did not wish to live any longer.
    Kai was next to awaken, in his own way.  The feelings of grief and
empathy suddenly replaced with RAGE.  It flowed through his entire being
like
nothing he ever felt before.  His battle ki showed as he started thinking of
slow and painful ways for the defiler to die.  His power up was so strong
that it knocked Ryouga over, which fully returned the lost boy to his
senses.

    Then the transformation began, first going super sai-jin, then after a
few seconds his ki got even stronger as he went SSJ2.  His now golden hair
began to grow as something that usually had to be done with training started
to manifest itself.  Kai's eyebrows began to recess then finally disappeared
altogether.  With a loud scream of frustration and rage, he finished the
transformation.
    As for Ryouga, he could barely believe his eyes.  If he hadn't witnessed
the transformation, he wouldn't have believed this was really Kai.
    "Ryouga, carry Sasami.  The others are here and probably captured as
well.  We must go search for them."
    Ryouga nodded and started to bind Sasami's many wounds.  Seeing that she
wouldn't last very long with her energy that low, Kai gave her a VERY small
portion of her energy.  Even so, it was enough to jolt her awake…

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Kagato stopped.  He hated to be interrupted, but when a scream that loud
sounded, people tended to listen.  What bad timing too, Kagato had just
gotten the restrained Ayeka's clothes off after about five or six minutes of
whipping with a cat-o-nine-tails, leaving her skin shredded from the
electrified pieces of sharp metal on each tip.
    "Wait for me, Princess Ayeka, it seems that an intruder had come aboard
the Sousa to rescue you.  Don't worry, it won't take long."
    With a chuckle, Kagato left the dangling princess alone for now.  He
teleported to his control room and began searching the rooms for the enemy.
All the while wondering WHO would dare to challenge him, Kagato, aboard his
own ship.
    Getting bored with the search, Kagato decided to see if the little one
had awakened yet.  He commanded the image brought up and was treated to the
very interesting sight…

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    …of Sasami running naked around a stunned Kai (still SSJ3) and Ryouga
at
around 100 miles an hour.  After a minute of this, she fell back asleep from
exhaustion.
    "Kai?"  Asked a dumbstruck Ryouga.  "Why did you give her so much
energy?"
    "I swear, I gave her only a little bit!"  Answered an equally dumbstruck
Kai (and remember, there is nothing funnier than a dumbstruck Super
Sai-jin).
    "Oh well, at least her dreams look happy again."
    "Yeah, that was horrible.  I'm gonna get the others and bring them here.
You can clothe Sasami until I get back"
    "Hey!  Why don't I get to go!"
    "Would you like us to appear in the middle of the main power core of
this
ship?"
    o_o "Good point."

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Kai went from room to room, gathering more friends as he went by.
    First was Tenchi, trapped in a weirdly shaped room that would not allow
him to get into any kind of comfortable condition.  Which basically made him
pissed off (OOC, I know, I know) and ready to strike out at the first person
he saw.
    Next was Washu, who after being freed from her crystal prison mumbled,
"I
am the greatest scientific genius in the universe…no…you can't mean
that…I
am."  After calming her down, she had the presence of mind to ask about the
unconscious Tenchi with him.
    "Oh, he's all right.  I just hope I didn't hit him too hard."  Said a
thoroughly embarrassed Kai.
    Then came Ryoko, who was very glad not to be alone anymore.
    Ayeka was healed by Washu, then recovered and ordered new clothes be
made
at once.  An obvious assurance that she would be okay.
    Finally, Mihoshi.  Apparently, Kagato couldn't think of an effective
mental torture for her so she was just left alone.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

They all appeared in front of Ryouga and a fully clothed (yet still
unconscious) Sasami.  Everyone except Kai asked a confused Ryouga the
questions plaguing their minds.
"Where the #@$% are we?!"
"When can we eat?"
"How did you get here?"
"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SISTER?!!!"
"Who is he?"
Ryouga laughed at the last one and answered/asked Tenchi, "What, you mean
you
don't recognize Kai?"
"KAI!!!" exclaimed all of them at once.
"How did this happen?" asked Washu, "His power is off my readout."
Kai answered, "Long story, short fic, tell you later."
Far off in the distance, they could hear a wall breaking.
*group sweatdrop*
Ayeka then announced, "Lord Tenchi, Kagato has returned, we must stop him!"
"Awww, can't we just go home?  I don't really feel like fighting today."
Commented Mihoshi.
Ryoko proceeded to grab Mihoshi's ear and yell into it, "WE CAN'T DO THAT!
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING YOU LITTLE DITZ!  HELLO, IS ANYBODY IN THERE!"
"Calm down Ryoko." interceded Kai.  After a moment to detach Ryoko, he said,
"I will show you something to remove all doubts from even the most empty of
minds.  Ryouga, please show them Sasami."
Looking away, Ryouga exposed Sasami's mutilated chest once again, then
quickly covered it back up.
"Kai?  How long do you think it will be before they move again?"  asked
Ryouga.
But the point was moot as the gang recovered.

Tenchi summoned the Light Hawk Wings with ease, "Where is the #$^%&#*!!?"
Washu changed into her volleyball uniform.  "I have a very special place I'd
like to stick this condensed thermonuclear war…oops…I mean ball, I
really
did!

"I'MGONNAKILLTHE@#$^#@$%$#^@^$%$#^%%^%@#$%#$^#@^$#@%#$%$@#^$#@^%$#^%@#$^$#@%#$

@^@#%$%^%^$#@%@^%@#^@$%$@^@^@%@^@#%@$#^@%%@$^@&&@%@^@&@$&&@^$$#@^@$#^%@#^@#%&

@#%^@$#^^%^#$!"  Muttered Ryoko as she phased into her battle suit.
Ayeka, meanwhile, changed into some leathers (causing Ryouga's nose to bleed
profusely) and cracked HER whip.  "I know one naughty boy that needs to be
whipped!"
(Insert annoying Ayeka laugh here)
Mihoshi started crying, but didn't hold back her enthusiasm as she played
with her cube and got two shoulder mounted BFLC's (Not a BFG, a BFLC=Big
@#$%^&* Laser Cannon).  "Dang, I was trying to get something bigger, but
these will have to do *sigh*
"Well," said Ryouga (after wiping all of the blood off), "That worked well.
Now all we have to do is find that Kagato guy."
At the mention of Kagato, Ryouga found himself at the end of an assortment
of
various weapons and getting scary looks from all of the girls (and one boy).
Fortunately, they held back until they heard Kagato's voice coming from
nowhere.
"Ah, hello my loyal fans.  I see you have been enjoying yourselves.  No need
to look for me, I will just come get you."
With that, the group was teleported.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Kagato laughed at his own wit.  He had gone through the entrance
perfectly, down to the very last detail.  But when he turned around, his
'prisoners' were not in the cage where he had teleported them.
    Ryouga's 'talent' had worked again.  After Kai located where they were
in
relation to Kagato, he blasted the floor of their room to let everybody drop
in on top of Kagato.  After disengaging themselves, the whole group (except
the sleeping Sasami) vented their rage on the body of the former captor.
    As it turned out, Kagato's new body could take a lot more punishment
than
his last one.  This was just fine by Tenchi, Washu, Ayeka, Ryoko, Ryouga,
and
Mihoshi.  They played a game of cat and mouse throughout the entire ship.
Where if you found the evil, sick-minded villain, you got one free hit and
as
many others as you could fit in.  Obstacles were not a question because
nobody really gave a crap about those.


    Finally, Kagato was cornered in the main control room again with all six
of the players.  Just as they were about to kill him, Kai finally stepped
in.
 He made a shield around Kagato, which was soon tested as various powers
were
tried against it.  But it held.
    "Stop, don't you think he's had enough?"  Kai screamed.
    "NO!" all of them screamed back.
    "Well I do, so if you want to kill Kagato, you have to get through me."
    They tried, they failed miserably.
    "Now, we are all going home right now.  I'm not going to risk
teleportation, so we're going to have to fly."
    There was a lot of grumbling, but they all complied (after numerous
threats) and left the ship in a bubble of Kai's ki.  Leaving Kagato dazed,
badly beaten, but still alive.
    After a mile (.593 seconds), Tenchi was the only one not drained from
fighting to notice…
    "Hey Kai, why did you stop?"
    Kai smiled and laughed a very evil laugh.
    "YOU FOOLS!  DID YOU THINK I'D LET EVIL LIKE THAT GO COMPLETELY
UNPUNISHED.  NOW I WILL BE THE ONE TO KILL HIM, AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN
DO ABOUT IT!  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
Instantly, six mallets landed rather hard on Kai's golden head.  But this
had
no effect as he condensed two thirds of his power into a sphere on the tip
of
his finger.  It was golden in color and was about two inches in diameter.
Still laughing, Kai used his will power to fly the energy ball right in
front
of Kagato's face.
"oooh…the pretty colors"  were Kagato's last words.
It exploded.
"Uhh, Kai?"  Said Ryouga, "How much energy did you put into that thing?"
"About two thirds, why?"
"Remember what happened to Sasami."
"…oh crap…"
Kai prepared to teleport as the explosion neared them.  The explosion ended
up destroying two of the planets in the blast and five moons.
And the forms of our heroes (and the still sleeping Sasami) were destroyed
as
with all within the range of impact.  Nothing survived.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Nobuyuki was walking home from his work today, oblivious to any of the
going-ons in the universe.  He looked up and saw what he thought as a star
going super-nova and made a wish (don't know if it was an Earth or Juraian
custom, but he did so anyway) for the safety of his family.
    Suddenly, a hand shot out of the ground and grabbed his ankle.  Nobuyuki
screamed like a little girl and fainted.
    "Stupid Ryouga," complained a normal looking Kai, "I was expecting to
appear a few miles near Nobuyuki, heck, even above Nobuyuki.  But not below
him.  It takes so much energy to teleport in the place of matter."
    "What happens when you do?"  Asked Mihoshi in her ignorant way of
speaking.
    "The matter appears in your place," answered Washu, "isn't it obvious?
That's why it takes so much energy."
    "Hey Dad, are you ok?"  Tenchi tried reviving his father with little
luck.
    "Kai's looking normal again."  Pointed out Ryoko.
    "We know what that means."  Supplied Ayeka.
    Again, six mallets rushed to make an appointment with Kai's head.  But
Kai remembered Sasami's condition, which made him go SSJ3 again.
    CRACK*6!
    "Dangit, those were some good mallets too."
    "Washu," said Kai, "you can erase Sasami's memory, right?"
    "Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.  But I can't stop the scarring, they
are permanent.
    "Not if I have anything to say about it.  I am going to heal Sasami,
I'll
be right back."
    Kai picked up Sasami and promptly disappeared.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    They reappeared at the Sanctuary.  Dende was watching the Earth again
and
didn't notice Kai's approach.  He noticed when Kai knocked him back on his
butt and placed Sasami before him.
    "Heal her."  Kai growled.
    Dende was about to protest when two things hit him.  One was that his
old
pupil was SSJ3, the other was the small girl's condition.
    Earth's guardian was very complacent after that and Kai left with
Sasami's body and mind back in one piece.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

"Okay, done.  The number one greatest scientific genius in the universe has
done it again."
    "You mean that Sasami will have no memory whatsoever of today's events?"
Asked Kai.
    "Correct."
    After being reassured of this fact, Kai's body calmed down and left SSJ3
mode.
    WHACK*6!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    Sasami woke up early the next morning with a splitting headache.  Yet
she
fought it and started breakfast.  Soon enough, that went away too.
    Now it was again a normal day at the Masaki household.
    Except for one thing.
    "Kai?  Why aren't you eating?  Are you sick?  What happened to your
head?"  (guess who…)                                            THE END
    Woah, that took a long time.  I hope you all enjoyed it.  I also hope I
didn't make too many spelling and grammar errors.
    I lost most of my enthusiasm in writing this about the time of the fight
scene (if you can call it that) because of my mom.  Don't ask.  Anyway, I'm
a
usually a dull guy so I'm not sure if you noticed or not.
    Again, please send all thoughts/comments/suggestions/flames to
Vandalier1@aol.com.  Really, I won't mind one bit.  'Till next time.
