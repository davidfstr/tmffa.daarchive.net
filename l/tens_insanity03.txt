Tenchi's Insanity Series

Chapter 3: Eat to Death

Back at Tenchi's house, Tenchi was waiting for the girls for a few 
days.  But it was almost three or four days since they came.  Tenchi 
was getting worried.  He was happy that they stopped visiting daily.  
But this was bad timing.  Tenchi watched as the reminds of Sakuya was 
taken to the Tokyo Hospital morgue.  Tenchi loved the sight of her 
motionless, lifeless, bloody body being dragged off in an ambulance.
"One down, eight to go," Tenchi said. "But they must have heard the 
news.  They'll wait for the killer to be caught.  That'll be a long 
wait,"
Tenchi was now getting bored.  Tenchi needed them to come on their own 
power so he can have the pleasure to kill them in complete surprise.
"I'm getting sick of waiting," Tenchi said out loud. "If the girls 
won't come to me.  Then I guess I have to go to them.  Won't that just 
delight them to death?"

Back at the Masaki shrine, the girls were living without a clue what 
happened.  Sasami was cooking lunch as usual.  Ayeka and Ryoko were 
fighting as usual.  Washu was in her lab as usual.  And Mihoshi was 
annoying the living hell out of Kiyone.  And Ryo-Ohki was running 
around bumping into things then into people.  She was meowing a lot and 
loudly.  The only reason was that she was hungry.  She tried Sasami 
eight times in the past four hours.  She tried Ayeka and Ryoko ten 
times each.  She tried to enter Washu's lab but it was locked.  She 
tried Kiyone and almost got stepped on by Mihoshi.  She was almost 
about to give up.  But her hunger wouldn't allow it.  She went to the 
garden pass Sasami who was now on the phone.
"Hello." She said.
"Hi Sasami," Tenchi said. "I'm on my way to the shrine.  I'll be there 
is a few hours."
"Oh that's great," Sasami said. "I'll tell the others."
"Good.  And tell them this," Tenchi said. "I'm getting ready to give 
each of you something that'll last for life."
"Really?" Sasami almost squalled. "I'll tell them right away."
She hanged up at the same time Tenchi did.
"I'll be waiting for it." Tenchi said.
Sasami was running all over the shrine to find the other girls.  One by 
one she found them.
"Ayeka, Ryoko.  Tenchi's returning." Sasami said.
"You're kidding?" Ryoko said.
"I'm not." Sasami said happily.
"Well, I guess Lord Tenchi was unable to resist my soft, smooth skin 
and hair.  Not to mention my beautiful eyes."
"It's sure as hell it's not your boobs.  They're smaller than 
Sasami's," Ryoko said. "Mine however are the third biggest.  Kiyone 
being the second biggest and Mihoshi is the biggest."
Sasami laughed but Ayeka glared that laugh down.
"Sasami, I'm about to say something not for you ears." Ayeka said.
"What?  You're going to call Ryoko a space pirate slut?" Sasami said.
Ayeka almost jumped out of her skin.
"Sasami?  Such language.  It's not proper for a young princess to 
talk." Ayeka said.
"Plus how did a young girl learned that word?" Ryoko said.
"I sneaked into Tenchi's dad's room.  Under his bed are the juiciest 
porn magazines I have ever seen." Sasami said.
Ayeka felt her heart stop.  Sasami started on Jurai as a sweet innocent 
girl.  But turned into a fowl mouth porn lover.  Ayeka was speechless.  
Ryoko on the other hand was not.
"So you're all grown up." Ryoko said.
"My true age is 708," Sasami said. "And Ayeka is about 722."
"I know." Ryoko said.
"Sasami. you're mind. is dirty." Ayeka gasped.
"I just want to tell you that now my little secret is out," Sasami 
said. "I have a plan to make Tenchi happy."
"And what would that be?" Ryoko said.
"I'll explain it over lunch." Sasami said.
"I don't feel like eating.  Ever again." Ayeka said.
"Please.  I'm still a good cook." Sasami said.
Ayeka looked at her innocent face and forgot about her fowl mouth.
"Okay I'll join in." Ayeka said.
"Great.  Lunch will be done in two hours." Sasami said.

Sasami worked her hardest on this lunch.  She cooked a big lunch 
because she needed something strong so they will have a real hard time 
to say no.  The other six were sitting around the table and watched 
Sasami bring out dish after dish of delicious food.  Mihoshi was 
drooling madly.  She never saw nor smelled anything as good as this.
"Wow, Sasami.  You have outdone yourself this time." Mihoshi said.
"Thank you.  You can dig in anytime you want." Sasami said.
The girls did so.  But Ryo-Ohki felt left out.  She looked at Sasami 
with puppy dog eyes.
"I'm sorry Ryo-Ohki.  I promise when Tenchi returns.  You'll be fed."
Ryo-Ohki meowed happily then ran off.
"I think Sasami had an alternative modem to this meal." Ryoko said.
"It's maybe the hot sauce." Mihoshi said.
"Not that you moron." Kiyone said.
Mihoshi didn't hear the insult.
"I actually do have another reason for this meal." Sasami said.
"And that is?" Washu asked.
"I wanted something special for Tenchi.  Something that he'll never 
forget." Sasami said.
"What would that be?" Kiyone said.
"I want." Sasami said.
Everyone listened in closely.
"To make Tenchi happy." Sasami said.
"That's it?" Washu asked.
"Yep," Sasami said. "And since I am the cutest.  I'll get Tenchi for 
sure."
"I think I can help with that," Ryoko said. "If you want to hear it?"
"Sure we want to hear it," Sasami said happily. "But I doubt it'll be 
is good as my idea."
"What idea?" Mihoshi asked.
"Never mind." Sasami said.
"My idea is simple enough that even someone like Mihoshi can 
understand," Ryoko said.
Mihoshi looked away.
"We all have special skills." Ryoko started.
"So what?" Kiyone asked.
"So if we use our best skills on Tenchi," Ryoko said. "He'll see that 
I'm. err. the woman is the best for him."
"Wow.  Sounds complex." Mihoshi said.
Everyone looked at Mihoshi a little confused.
"Yeah," Ryoko said dryly. "But I will win no contest."
"I doubt that you galactic bitch." Ayeka said.
Again the others were shocked, but not as shocked as before.
"Well, I'm convinced that the princesses are now foulmouthed." Washu 
said.
"You say that as if it's a bad thing." Ryoko said charmingly.
Washu looked her and sighed.
"I guess we have to see if Tenchi will agree to this little contest." 
Washu said.
"I think it'll be best if Tenchi found out by himself," Sasami said. 
"It'll make it more fun.  Plus when I heard him, he said he had 
something special planned for us."
The other girls looked at each other then at Sasami.
"Then the contest for Tenchi's heart is on." Kiyone said.
"I just want his love and time to time sex," Mihoshi said. "That and a 
cheese burger."
That comment made the outers fall in an anime style.
"Was it something I said?" Mihoshi said.

An hour later, Tenchi returned.  He took a deep breath of the fresh 
clean air.
'This air feels so good,' Tenchi thought. 'And soon the girls will 
breathe the last piece of fresh air here.'
He walked to the shrine and into the house.
"Hello?" Tenchi called out.
He knew Ryoko was about to come threw the wall and tries to hug him.  
He was right and wrong.  Ryoko did spring to Tenchi.  Only she came 
from the floor.
"Oh hello, my Tenchi." Ryoko purred.
Tenchi made an unseen fist then relaxed.
"Oh, hi Ryoko.  It's good to see you again." Tenchi said. 'And maybe 
for the last time.' He added in thought.
"So what is your surprise?" Ryoko almost whispered into Tenchi's ear.
"It's special.  Something you'll never forget as long as you live." 
Tenchi said.
"Ooh.  Something spicy.  I love spicy." Ryoko said.
'Then you must your own breath.  You have enough hot air to fill a 
balloon the size of this planet.' Tenchi thought.
"Well, let's go into the next room.  Sasami has something to ask you." 
Ryoko said.
"Oh.  Okay." Tenchi said. 'I hope it's a pled for mercy before I kill 
her.'
Tenchi and Ryoko entered into the next room and saw the girls sitting 
in a circle.  Tenchi was getting real nervous.
"What is this about?" Tenchi asked.
"Well, Sasami decided that we wanted you," said Mihoshi. "This is a 
welcome home party."
Tenchi started to calm down.  Now that knew the girls were being nice 
to him, he felt sorry that he killed Sakuya.
"Welcome home." They all said.
'Soon your home will be in a grave.' Tenchi thought.
"So what do you say?" Sasami said.
"Please say you're pleased." Ayeka said.
'Time to say something stupid,' Tenchi thought. 'I very doubt they'll 
fall for it.  Washu is too smart.  And even that bonehead Mihoshi is 
too smart to fall for this old trick.  But it's almost worth the try.'
"You're pleased," Tenchi joked.
The girls fall anime style from that lame joke.
"Had to say it." Tenchi said.
"Okay.  Now that's done," Washu said. "You may want to freshen up."
"It must have been a long trip." Kiyone said.
Tenchi laughed silently.
"It was," Tenchi said. "But it was worth it."
"Cool." Ryoko said.
"I'll have dinner with you girls," Tenchi said. "But first I think I'll 
play with Ryo-Ohki."
"She's in the field." Sasami said.
"I just have one thing to ask for." Tenchi said.
"What is it?" Washu asked.
"I would like to see Washu's lab," Tenchi said. "I've haven't been 
there for some time."
The girls but Washu was in shock.  Washu however was very calm.
"I'll let you use my lab on one condition." Washu said.
"And this is." Tenchi asked.
"If you." Washu said. "Call me 'Little Washu'."
The others fell anime style.
"Okay Little Washu." Tenchi said.
"Is there a reason for the use of Little Washu's lab?" Ryoko said.
"Not reason," Tenchi said. "I just think it is a cool place."
"Thank Tenchi," Washu said. "I did set up an air cooler last month."
"Little Washu." Tenchi asked.
"Yes." Washu said.
"It was a figure of speech." Tenchi said.
Ayeka giggled at that.  Washu glared at her.
"I'll see you later.  Today I want to take in the clean air." Tenchi 
said.
The girls understood.  As they let, they wondered who'd be first.  But 
what they didn't know will kill them.

Tenchi entered Washu's lab.  It was bigger then he remembered.  As he 
walked he tried his hardest not to trip any traps.  He looked in every 
desk.  He found needles with weird words on them, guns with live ammo 
in it, also a shield generator with the power to rival the Light Hawk 
Wings.  He took them all.  He looked and took everything he could carry 
and some things to help him carry more.  At last he found what we was 
looking for. It was a special veil.  The veil said 'Appetite Enhancer'.  
Tenchi took it and read the warning label.  That made Tenchi smile and 
give him an idea.

As he exited he saw Ryo-Ohki.
"Hello, Ryo-Ohki," Tenchi said in a real innocent voice.
Ryo-Ohki meowed happily.
"Do you want a carrot?  Huh?  Do ya little girl?" Tenchi said.
Ryo-Ohki meowed very happily.  All she thinks of is carrots, carrots, 
and more carrots.  Tenchi knew that.
"Ryo-Ohki, you'll have all the carrots you'll ever want," Tenchi said 
leading Ryo-Ohki.
Ryo-Ohki ran at Tenchi's side.  He led her to the carrot field.  Ryo-
Ohki's eyes glowed brightly.
"I know even you have a limit of how much you can eat," Tenchi said 
pulling out a needle.
He also took out the Appetite Enhancer veil.  Ryo-Ohki saw what Tenchi 
was doing without a clue.
"But it would be ironic if you die by what you love," Tenchi said 
dropping the veil.
As he moved the needle Ryo-Ohki got scared.  She tried to run but 
Tenchi caught her.  She then tried to transform but Tenchi was too 
quick.  He stabbed Ryo-Ohki in the back and injected the chemical.  
Tenchi injected every single drop into Ryo-Ohki.  Ryo-Ohki suddenly was 
hungry, extremely hungry.
"Go Ryo-Ohki.  All you can eat and more until you get sick then until 
you die." Tenchi said.
Ryo-Ohki heard that as she attacked carrot after carrot.  The field in 
total was two to three miles of carrots in length and width.  Ryo-Ohki 
ate wildly as she grew fat.  Even though she was slowing in speed and 
gaining in weight, her hunger reminded high.  As she was over haft way 
done before she was physically full but she wanted more.  She continued 
eating, as she felt more sluggish.  As she ate, her mind was screaming 
to stop.  But her stomach was in control.  Near the end of the carrot 
field Ryo-Ohki's heart was starting to give.  As the last carrot was 
eaten, Ryo-Ohki's heart stopped and she finally died.  Tenchi walked to 
the dead body and picked it up.  He took out an orb and it aborted the 
corpse.
"Mini coffins.  Little Washu, you are a genius." Tenchi said.
 
Back at his room, Tenchi had the picture again.  He carefully cut out 
Ryo-Ohki from the picture.  He placed the piece into the dead box.  He 
was singing again.
"Two are gone, six to go.  It's will be, as I say so.  But the dice 
that I'll will throw.  The next girl will scream, 'Oh God no'."

Tenchi: On the next episode, the contest is on.  Time the kill will be 
as ironic as the last.  Only this time, the girl can scream of mercy.  
The next episode is: Irony Thy Name Is Tenchi.

This is 3 of 11.  The next story has an alien death.  A humanoid alien 
death.  Thank you for reading.
