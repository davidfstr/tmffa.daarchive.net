	Ayeka and Ryoko.=20
An improbable Tenchi Muyo Lemon.

This fic is based on OVA continuity.
one Jurian or galactic standard year is 2.5 earth years.
<SOUND EFFECT>


	The Misaki home was a wreck. Not that this was an entirely unusual
situation. If it
weren=92t for the fact that the greatest mind the universe had ever produced
was in residence
then the Misaki family would be in perpetual debt to the local furniture
store.
	Still, this was Ayeka and Ryoko=92s fourth major fight this week. And it wa=
s
only
Tuesday.
	=93ITS ONLY TUESDAY!=94 Tenchi was slightly annoyed. =93Tuesday. This week=
 is
barely begun and Washuu has had to make us new furniture FOUR TIMES!=94
Tenchi was
REALLY annoyed. =93I  want the two of you to stay somewhere else for a coupl=
e
of days.
You need to work out your differences. Because the next fight you two have
in this house
will be the last.=94
	Ayeka=92s eyes widened. =93What do you mean =91stay somewhere else=92?=
 Where are we
supposed to go? She has a ship, Where do I go?=94
	Ryoko smirked. =93Don=92t look at me Princess.=94
	=93You can both go stay on Ryo-ohki. I want you to work out your problems.=
=94
	=93But Tenchi!=94 Ryoko protested
	=93No buts!=94 Tenchi stormed off.
	Sasami who had watched this whole exchange looked worried. =93You better do
what he wants. I=92ve never seen him get this mad before.=94
	=93I have.=94 Ryoko=92s head drooped a little.
	=93mow.=94 Ryo-ohki agreed.
	=93You two go stay on Ryo-ohki for a couple of days, I=92ll try to talk to
Tenchi.=94
	Ryo-ohki hopped off of Sasami=92s head and bounded outside.
	Ryoko followed, and Ayeka came slowly behind.

	A few minutes later the pair where sitting inside Ryo-ohki sipping tea and
glaring
at each other.
	Ayeka sighed. =93All right I guess we better see if we can=92t find some
middle ground,
I don=92t want to get kicked out of the house anymore than you do.=94
	Ryoko lay back on floor and stretched out. =93I don=92t think we can. Were
just to
pig-headed.=94
	Ayeka thought about her training. As the future ruler or bride of the
ruler of Jurai
she was trained in diplomacy. <Now what?> Ayeka thought carefully. <Air out
past
grievances I suppose.> =93Okay Ryoko, lets talk. Do you want to go first?=94
	Ryoko gave her a Shrug and gestured towards Ayeka for her to go first.
	=93All right. Seven hundred years ago I barely knew your name. But then you
came
and invaded my home, destroyed places my family had dwelled in for hundreds=
 of
thousands of years. And worst of all YOU STOLE MY FIANCEE!=94
	Ryoko reeled from the force of Ayeka=92s hatred.
	=93And just how was any of that my fault? I was Kagato=92s prisoner. I did
what he
ordered, no questions asked.=94
	=93That=92s an awfully convenient excuse. You did more than what was asked.=
 YOU
ENJOYED THE DESTRUCTION!=94
	Ryoko grinned. =93Well, maybe a little.=94
	Ayeka fumed.
	=93Still, I spent seven hundred years in cave for what I did. I=92ve paid f=
or
my crime.=94
Ryoko looked out at the stars visible in the viewscreens. Ryo-ohki was
floating high above
the earth. Ryoko spun to face Ayeka, her eyes widening. =93So you really
don=92t have any
feelings for Tenchi! You just  pursue him to spite me. DON=92T YOU!?=94
	Ayeka became livid =93THAT IS NOT TRUE.  I LOVE TENCHI!=94
	=93WELL SO DO I DAMMIT!=94
	A couple of dozen small wooden logs appeared in the air. An electrical=
 field
crackled around Ryoko. A battle seemed immanent.
	With a sigh Ayeka dropped her forcefield. Seeing this Ryoko powered down.
	=93Maybe there=92s hope for us after all.=94 Seemingly from nowhere Ryoko
produced a
bottle of Saki. =93Want a drink?=94
	Ayeka sat back down. =93Sure.=94
	=93So, if you don=92t go after Tenchi to get back at me, then why?=94
	=93Do you know what it means to be a crown princess? It means to be a
bargaining
chip. Barter. Princess are often given in marriage to prevent wars and
cement alliances.
Being a CROWN princess simply means I=92m worth more in trade. All my life I=
 met
princes=92 and nobles who where very nice to me. But I=92m not a fool I know
what they all
wanted. I got so fed up with it I begged my mother to arrange marriage with
someone;
anyone, I didn=92t care who. I just wanted it over with.=20
	Fortunately I was engaged to Yosho, I loved him. And I hated you for
taking him
away. I waited two Jurian years before I  came after him. No one else
bothered to look for
him for 280 years. I guess we didn=92t realize he would have aged so much in
such a short
time. You=92ve seen his mother, Juri has kept her young for almost twenty
times her natural
span. But Yosho is now too old for me to marry him.=94
	=93How come?=94
	=93What?=94
	=93Why is he to old? Are you that shallow?=94
	=93I am not shallow! For one thing it=92s against Jurian Law. You have to=
 marry
someone who is close to you in your lifespan. Mine has just begun and his
is close to over.
Where was I?=94
	=93Well, before you  went off on a tangent you where explaining why you=
 love
Tenchi.=94
	=93Oh, yeah. Well anyway, so I trace Yosho to this world and wake up just i=
n
time
to see you set free, without one single charge left to kill you over. I was
a little upset...no, I take that back. I WAS MAD AS HELL! So I went after
you anyway, I fired on a
protected planet and took a native prisoner. Both of which could earn even
a noble a
severe reprimand. Then I meet this guy, who=92s, well cute first off. Plus
he=92s brave, I mean
I have him chased down by my guardians and when I do catch him he=92s not
even afraid.
And then, despite everything I did to him, he opens his home to me and
treats me with
kindness and respect without expecting anything in return.  That is why I
love him. I love
his spirit, his strength and his nobility.=94
	Ayeka looked down at her untouched glass of Saki. quickly she drained the=
 cup
and held out her cup for more.
	Ryoko filled the cup. =93My turn?=94
 	Ayeka nodded.
	=93For 5000 earth years I worked for Kagato. He sent me on my first mission
within
hours of my emergence. He was the only person I ever really knew.
Everything I was
before Yosho imprisoned me I was because of him.
	Then I wound up in a cave. After awhile I figured out how to separate my
astral
form and travel around the shrine area. I couldn=92t go very far, but it was
better than
nothing. By the time I  got out Achika was a teenager. I could feel the
Jurai power within
her and Grandfather, I assumed they where Yosho=92s descendants. They really
didn=92t
interest me. But then came Tenchi. I couldn=92t figure out why Achika kept
getting bigger, I
thought she was just eating too much. Then one day she went into labor,
right in the shrine
office. Tenchi was born before the doctor arrived.=94
	Ryoko smiled and closed her eyes. =93You should have seen him, he was the=
 most
amazing thing I had ever seen, I really didn=92t know anything about
reproduction. But I
watched Tenchi grow, I saw his first steps, his first falls, I cried with
him when Achika
died and wanted to be with him more than anything. That=92s when I started t=
o
use my small
store of energy to create a new gem. I let my body almost rot away. Then in
comes
Tenchi, when I saw him I wanted to hold him, to be his friend, I reached
out to him and
was mortified when I saw the terror in his eyes. When I healed my self and
formed a new
gem from the energies I could collect outside I went to him. I wanted to
play. I guess I
played to hard since we destroyed his school. But I was impressed he showed
strength and
skill and courage. I loved him even more for it. I went back to his home
and climbed into
his bed. You pretty much know the rest. I don=92t Just love Tenchi, to me
Tenchi IS love.=94
	Ayeka finished her Saki. =93Well, that covers Tenchi. But what about me?=94
	Ryoko giggled. =93you don=92t seem to get it. I don=92t hate you. I never=
 have. I=92m
afraid that Tenchi might eventually choose you over me. YOU have a throne
to offer him.
I don=92t have anything. I just hope that we can somehow share him. That=92s
why I was
willing to let you go first. I don=92t mind sharing, as long as I  get him=
 too.=94
	=93I don=92t think we can. I=92m a princess, your a space pirate. I doubt y=
ou
could ever
be accepted by Jurai.=94
	Ryoko drank a cup of Saki and poured another. =93Like mother, like=
 daughter.=94
	=93AND JUST WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN!?=94
	=93Oh, come on. Surely you know about your mother and Funaho. I mean the
emperor of Jurai comes home with some women from a backwater planet in the
middle of
nowhere and makes her queen over his long time fianc=E9, who=92s a noble. Ho=
w
do you think
that went? From what I=92ve heard they came close to starting a war on a
couple of
occasions.=94
	Ayeka sat her cup down. =93Well maybe at first. But mother and aunt Funaho=
 love
each other. In fact a couple of times when father was off performing duties
somewhere I
found them in bed together.=94
	<LOUD SQUIRTING SOUND>
	=93Ryoko? Are you okay?=94
	=93Oh, sure I just love having Saki shoot out my nose.=94 Ryoko wiped her f=
ace
with a
cloth. =93Explain that comment please.=94
	=93What do I have to do draw you a diagram?=94
 	=93I didn=92t know Jurian=92s did that sort of thing.=94
	=93Wives do, sometimes.=94
	Ryoko smiled, and looked at Ayeka like a cat looks at a mouse. =93Maybe we=
 CAN
get along...=94
	Ayeka scooted away from Ryoko as fast as she could, finally she hit the=
 wall.
Ryoko closed in on her on all fours.=20
	=93Wha...what are you doing!?=94
	Ryoko laughed. =93Guess!=94 Ryoko closed the distance between them. She=
 moved in
on Ayeka. Her face coming close to Ayeka=92s.
	Ayeka tried to back away but wound up sliding down under Ryoko.
	=93Perfect, now hold that position.=94 Ryoko kissed Ayeka, stifling a cry
before it
could escape her lips. The area of Ryo-ohki where they where laying
softened and took on
the texture of soft bedding, the internal lighting dimmed and the starlight
seemed to
intensify. Ryoko pulled off Ayeka=92s outer garment=92s one-by-one  until on=
ly
her inermost
garment remained.
	Ryoko smiled, her teeth gleaming in the half light. Ryoko opend Ayeka=92s=
 final
garment. She kissed ayeka=92s shoulders and continued downwards as the
garment peeled
away. Ayeka=92s breasts came into view. they where smaller than Ryoko=92s bu=
t
well formed
and topped with cherry colored nipples which where becoming hardened.
	Ryoko took on of Ayeka=92s nipples into her mouth and sucked gently,
scraping it
against her teeth.
	Ayeka moaned softly, her eyes closed as she lay back and acepted Ryoko=92s
caresses. A chill ran down her spine.
	Ryoko paused long enough to slither out of her clothes. then went back to
Ayeka.
Ryoko=92s hand slid down between Ayeka=92s legs. Ayeka was wet enough that=
 Ryoko=92s
finger slid inside but she quickly came to her intact hymen. [Better save
that for Tenchi.]
	Ryoko moved  down between Ayekas legs. She licked the lips of Ayeka=92s=
 sex,
tasting the moistness. She flicked her tongue across Ayeka=92s erect clit.
	Ayeka=92s hips moved up and her legs clamped around Ryoko=92s head as she=
 had her
first orgasm.
	Ryoko sat up and manuvered herself so that her sex touched Ayeka=92s. The=
 two
girls locked there legs together and rubbed and bumped there clits against
each other.
	Ayeka grabbed Ryoko=92s shoulders and pulled her into an embrace. the two
kissed
deeply, their tongues intertwining.

	The two continued there caresses for another hour before falling into an
exausted
sleep.


THE END (more or less)


Authors notes.

 	The odds of this actually happenning in the Tenchi uniiverse are only
slightly worse than the odds of getting struck by lightening five times, on
a clouldless day, inside, just after finding out you won the lottery.

Of course it was fun. I thought about useing love potions, placing this
after the two girls are both married to Tenchi and a few other things.
Those all seemed like cop-outs, this was the hard way

I might continue this with a =91next day=92 story. (fat chance 2-26-98)



And now that fragment I mentioned.



	The rain was coming down in a near flood. Tenchi and Ayeka
where inside the small cabin between the temple and the house.
	"Why do feel like we've done this before" Tenchi built a small fire in
the metal box on the floor.
	Ayeka laughed, "we have; remember?"
	"How could I forget" *it was the first time I held you in my arms*.
Tenchi wrung out his shirt and hung it on a nail, he took of his shoes and
socks and lay them against the wall. When he turned around Ayeka was
laying her multilayered garment on the bench against the wall.
	Ayeka lay out each wet garment on the bench to dry. When she was
done there was no room to sit on the bench. She walked to the end of the
small cabin and from a cardboard box produced a sleeping mat and
blankets, which she lay out on the floor in front of the fire.
	Tenchi watched Ayeka lay out the mat; he hadn't known there was
one there. He couldn't think of any reason for one to be there, but then
again, why question a good thing.
	"Come on, sit next to me." Ayeka patted the mat next to her.
	"My pants are too wet."
	Ayeka stood up and faced Tenchi, "take them off."
	"I'm not wearing anything underneath, I'll just go stand outside."
	Ayeka moved between Tenchi and the door. "It's raining to hard to
be out there." Ayeka kissed Tenchi. "I want you to stay with me." She put
her arms around Tenchi.
	Tenchi tried to pull away "Ayeka, I cant...."
	Ayeka caught his belt-loops with one hand and touched his lips with
her forefinger. "Shh. I know you don't want to choose; and I'm not asking
you to. I just want you to give me some time." Ayeka kissed Tenchi,
pushing him against the wall. She pulled open the front of his jeans and
reached inside them.
	"Ayeka, please. What if Ryoko finds out?"
	"Ryoko said I could go first."
	Ayeka's tongue slipped into Tenchi's mouth. This combined with
her hands in his jeans short circuited his brain. He began to return the=
 kiss.
	Ayeka broke of the kiss and pulled Tenchi's jeans off. She stepped
back and looked him over. His body was slim and Lithe, his chest was
smooth. His torso was well defined, a testament to his martial arts=
 training.
Ayeka felt a dampness that had nothing to do with the rain.
	Tenchi turned red and glanced down at himself; making sure he
hadn't grown any extra parts that were making Ayeka stare so long.
	Ayeka removed her innermost garment and lay it on the bench with
the others. She stood before him naked, only her key on her forehead.
	Now it was Tenchi who stared. Ayeka was thin and pale, her breast
where the proverbial handful with rosy pink nipples. Her stomach was flat,
legs long and smooth. Tenchi's eyes where drawn to the curly hairs
between her legs. her hair color was apparently natural.
	Ayeka put her arms around Tenchi, pressing her breasts into his
chest. She looked into his eyes. "Tenchi, have you ever done this before?"
	Tenchi kissed Ayeka. He ran his hands down her back and over her
rear, her skin was smooth and soft. He guided her down onto the mat, her
nipples where hard against his chest. He ended their kiss, his mouth found
her ear lobe. He nibbled softly. His right hand slid down her side, over the
curve of her hip and down her leg. His left arm supported her. He kissed
her cheek and the side of her neck. He tickled the skin on the back of her
knees.
	Ayeka reveled in the sensations Tenchi was evoking in her, after so
much time he was hers. But she felt a small amount of guilt. Her education
on Juri had included several text on lovemaking. For nobles it was a skill=
 to
be learned, not so much something done on instinct. At the least a
theoretical knowledge was expected. She had saved herself for Yosho, so
her practical experience was non-existent. All her Jurian teachings said it
was her responsibility to please her partner.
	Of course, this was earth....
	Tenchi flicked his tounge across one of her nipples, her breasts
where extremly sensative.
	....And heaven, she concluded.
	Ayeka wrapped her arms around Tenchi's neck.=20
	Tenchi's right hand slid along her inside thigh, along her abdomen
and up to her breasts.  He held her left breast in his palm, squeezing=
 gently.
	Tenchi lowered Ayeka to the mat. He began to kiss her, starting just below
her
breasts, he kissed her lightly down to the vally between her legs. He felt
like he was going to explode.
