***********************************************************************************************************
Sasami was bored.
She paced slowly around the room, trying to think of something to do.  When nothing presented 
itself, she moved on to the next room.  This continued for 10 minutes, until she found herself in 
Noboyuki's room.  The large bookcase on one wall immediately grabbed her attention.

*hmm.....*

Nobody had really told her not to look at that, she had just sort of assumed.  Some of the stuff
in there *might* not be ..um.. like that.  And what else was there for her to do?

"Oh why not."

She reached for the shelf, pausing for an instant to decide what to grab.

"Penthouse?... maybe it's about archetechture, he is an architecht after all."

Her illusions about that possibility were quickly dispelled, and she found herself staring,
 transfixed.  A strange feeling washed over her, and her short legs began slowly rubbing against 
each other.

*What? No, I'm not supposed to be.. like.. this.* 

A familiar smell wafted up to her face, a little too familiar.

"Oh no."

Frantically, she looked under her kimonos, and seeing the small red spot on her panties.
She jumped up and ran the only place she could think of.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yup, nothing unusual at all, just a normal Jurian period."

*Snif*"I guess that's good.  But I'm only 9 Washu.  Mommy said Aeka was 12 when her first
came."

"Well, it is a little early, espically for a Jurian.  What about the 700 years you were in suspended
animation?  It's supposed to prevent aging, but the Jurian technique might not be perfected.  I'll
have to run a few more tests."

"But what about dinner?"

"I'll have Noboyuki make it."  As she set up the equipment for Sasami's tests, the experiment she
had been working on was automatically stored in the space that had once been the Masakis' broom
closet.

"Um.. I'm not sure I want to put everyone through that"

"It'll be okay, I think Noboyuki used to cook before you came here.  I'll go tell him now. Don't go
anywhere." With that, the redhead stepped through the dimension door which convieniently 
happend to appear nearby.

*sigh, It's not like I could go anywhere* she thought upon noticing the metal restraints gently
holding her to the table.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Whaddya mean I have to cook tonight?"

"Sasami's busy with me in the lab, so you'll just have to make dinner tonight."

"Is she ok?" Noboyuki asked, suddenly worried.

"She's fine, oh, and the lab will be inaccessable tonight, just to give us a little privacy."
With that, she dissappeared.

*What could be so important she seals the lab?* his mind ran through several possibilities, none
of them good.

Shaking his head to remove such thoughts, he loked at his watch.

"Well, if I'm going to make dinner tonight, I'd better get started." he steeled himself and made his
way into the kitchen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHA-BOOM!

an energy blast slammed into the hastially closed closet door, followed by a familier taunting voice
from the other side.

"Well well, princess. Aren't we the clever one?"

Caught up in the fight, the princess failed to notice she was in a dark closet instead of Washu's lab.
She looked around for a diversion.  Seeing the small cylander on a shelf in front of her, she grabbed
it and readied her forcefield.

"I suppose you've realized your only hope of getting out of this is to hide and hope I go away." As she
taunted through the door, the space pirate turned her head as if to walk away.  Noticing some movement
from the door's direction, and thinking her taunts had produced a reaction, she quickly turned back
towards the door and grabbed the tiny log that came flying her way.
Only it wasn't a log.

"Huh?" she thought looking perplexedly at the small blue cylander in her hands.  As she wondered what the
princess was trying to do, she almost didn't notice the three *real* logs coming her way.  Instantly she
tried to swat them away, but one was already inside her reach.  The projectile discharged its powerful
shock into Ryoko's solar plex, disorienting her for a second.

"I've got you now, demon."  The princess activated her forcefield a moment too late, sending azure
lightning coursing through the wake of Ryoko's hasty teleportation.  Aeka spun, ready to defend herself.
She made an EEP sound as a short crimson knife came down behind her, splitting the back of her kimono.

"How DARE you?!" shrieked the princess in outrage.  She stopped, stunned, and started blushing furiously,
pointing at an open-mouthed Noboyuki standing in the doorway.

"WHAT are you doing there you hentai?" she screamed, frantically trying to keep her clothes from falling.

"What is it princess? You afraid of him seeing something? Or just trying to keep your reputation?

"Wha? me? Oh I'm just making dinner and.. uh.. thought I'd make sure the house didn't get too.. damaged."

"You? Cook? What happened to Sasami?" asked the space pirate, puzzled.

"She's busy with Washu.  She said the lab would be closed for a while."

"Oh, ok. and as for you...."she stopped, noticing Aeka was nowhere to be seen.

"Probably wants to go change, the little prude, I should've...."her voice became inaudable as she
floated down the hall.

"Phew, and Ryoko calls her flat. heh heh" he chuckeled wistfully as he heads back into the kitchen.
His foot bumps something on the ground, which rolls a little.

"Huh?" he looked down at a small blue jar of something.

"Oh, this must have fallen out of the cabinet." he picked it up and placed it in the cabinet with
a few other sauces."
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bleep-Bleep-Bleep-Bleep

"oh gosh what happened now?"

The smoke alarm beeped urgently as a frantic Nobiyuki tried to turn off the source of the smoke.

"What's going on in here dad?"

"What? oh nothing, Sasami's busy with Washu so I had to fill in for her on dinner tonight."

"need some help?"

"Oh, no, I'm doing fine, see, the alarm stopped."(Tenchi's face-fault)

"Well, uh.. if you say so dad."Tenchi left the room and considered going out to eat tonight

"Let's see here, maybe Sasami left a little secret sauce or something around here." He opened a
cabinet and withdrew a promising-looking bottle.  He opened the jar and cautiously smelled it a little.

"Maybe this'll help, it smells good enough." he gingerly poured a little into the mixture in progress.
Upon noticing no ill effects, he poured a little more in, capped the jar, and replaced it in the cabinet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So where were you when it started?"

"Um..I was in Nobiyuki's room" she had been expecting this question but was'nt sure how to answer what
would come next.

"huh? What were you doing in there?"

"Well I *gulp* was really bored and, um, nobody actually ever told me to stay out of it."

"Out of what?" she had an idea but didn't want to make it sound like an accusation.

"His collection"

"mm-hmm Well, that explains it then.

"what?"

"Your.. umm.. arousal, must have prematurely triggered your period."

"But it was a.."

"Yes, which means that you're.. aroused by that."

"No.  I can't be like that!"

"Well, I never said you were, not necessarially."The scientist grinned to herself.  This little
discovery would really shake up the Jurian government when Sasami returned."

"Then what.. what's left?"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Okay Mihoshi?" the detective asked for the 3rd time.

"Okay!" replied her blonde partner.

"Really? You understand? You know what we're doing?"

"Yup, we're going to ask him to come with us on the yagami, and then we FUCK him!"

Kiyone gaped, astounded that her partner finally understood."That's IT.  You've finally got it.

"Are you proud of me?"

"Uh, yeah, I guess so." she had a feeling where this was headed.

"So, do I get a reward?" The blonde smiled evilly and started to undo her shirt"

"Well.." she decided to play along "I don't know... if you *really* want it"

"Oh I do I do" she started panting.

As the two gorgeous detectives leaned towards each other, the were rather rudely interrupted by a knock
 on their door

"Time to eat you two" Nobiyuki informed them through the door.

*Always the worst possible time* they reluctantly disengaged themselves, Mihoshi with a pouty frown and
Kiyone with a generally resentfullm look.

"Don't worry, we'll get back to this after dinner." consoled Kiyone with a final kiss.

"Alright, then. After dinner" *giggle*

The two straightened their clothes out and started through the door.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Hope you all like it!" said Noboyuki enthusiastically as he set down his creation.

"Hope we can all eat it" said Ryoko quietly.

"What happened to Sasami again?" questioned Mihoshi.

*sigh* "she's with Washu doing some..tests." sighed Aeka with exasperation which turned into disgust.
Everyone else suddenly developed similarially disgusted expressions.

Ryoko piped up with "I hope she's not trying to get a sample out of her."

"Ryoko, we're trying to eat here!" that from Kiyone.

"So let's start eating" encouraged Noboyuki, noticing everyone's hesitation.

In an uncharacteristicly bold move, Tenchi took the initiative and gulped a little of whatever it was.

*munch munch* "hhmm..hey, it's not bad."

"Really?" everyone started eating, agreeing with Tenchi on Noboyuki's surprisingly edible creation.

"Hey Tenchi" Kiyone finally spoke up.

"hmm?"

"About that report you have coming up on the planets of the system?"

"Mm-hmm"

"Mihoshi and I were thinking we could help you with it."

"Really?, how?"

"Well, we do have a spaceship, and I believe there's a short vacation before the report is due.  We were
thinking the three of us could go explore.. certain.. heavenly bodies." Kiyone started to grin slightly
at the use of that term.

"Yeah" chirped Mihoshi "We heven't really gotten out much recently, and it'd be *really* fun."

"Well, I guess..."

"Certainly not" Aeka interposed as it began to dawn on her what the two GP officers had planned. "Tenchi
has responsibilities and can't just go off whenever he wants to, right Tenchi?"

"Well it is for school now, and that's what a vacation is for, right" interjected Noboyuki, not quite
oblivious to what was in store for his son."

"well, I guess it would help with my report..sure, that sounds like a good idea."

Meanwhile, Ryoko's mind was busy creating a course of action to prevent what those two were planning.

*I'll have to do something before he leaves.  If those two get him alone with them, there's no telling what
they'll do.*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Where is it?"

the universe's greatest scientest, having released Sasami on an outpatient basis with the assuriance that
she isn't a lesbian (which was true after all, bisexuals aren't *technically* lesbians), was now trying to
locate another experiment.

"The record shows it was stored back in normal space, in the closet.  But it's not there! *sigh* I guess I'll
just have to scan for its molecular pattern around the house.  That'll take a while, but if it's been used,
the effects could be quite disastrous for the inhabitants." she thought about it for a second.  Then again,
it would give me some *very* interesting information, and I might finally get than pesky sample." thinking
about the possibility some more, she started to giggle, then laugh maniacally.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Moan* *Why can't I get it down?*

Tenchi had tried everything he could think of to get rid of this erection, but it just stayed there.  And
it was starting to hurt!

His thoughts were soon interrupted by some strange sounds from behind a certain door.  Curious, he leaned
closer.  His eyes widened and his breathing grew slightly raspy.

"Oh Mihoshi, YES"
*giggle*
"Right there! Oh don't stop! *moan* Oh Yes Yes Yes *pant*..."

he was interrupted just as a drop of blood fell from his nose by some movement at the end of the hall.

"Ack" he dashed around the nearest corner, shaking slightly, trying to supress the urge to stroke himself.

*wait, what am I afraid of? I'm just walking down the hall, right?*

with that, he resumed his course down the hall to the bathroom to try his last resort for the current
rather...large... problem.
He had just about stopped shaking by the time he turned the corner..... and ran right into Aeka.

"Oh, I'm uh, sorry, ex..excuse me" being that close to her was *not* helping him with his.. problem.

"Oh, excuse me, Lord Tenchi but, I was just looking for you"

"hmm? what about?"

"well..,"she hesitated,"there is something I wish..to show you."

"w..what?" he replied, trying to controll the sudden inexplicable urge rising within him.

"a..Jurian custom I believe you should be aware of" she answered, fighting a similer urge.

"o..ok, where.. is it" the urge was getting stronger, and he was now barely keeping his body upright.

"In m..my...." she was immediately cut short as they both succumbed to the inevitable and collapsed into
a tight and passionate embrace, kissing eagerly.

somehow, Aeka managed to break away and began leading Tench off in a half-walk half-run.
"Come, it can't wait", she explained, her voice shaky with barely contained desire.  Tenchi mumbled a reply
and followed obediently, his urgent mental protests silenced immediately.

*What's happening to me* he managed to think as he was being led off.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beep....Beep...Beep..Beep..BEEEEP

*the spice cabinet*
*sigh*
*This is not a good sign* thought the greatest scientific geinus in the universe as she looked apprehensively
at the cabinet her scanner pointed to.

Small ammounts of the substance had been detected throughout the house, but the largest deposit was directly
in front of her, inside the spice cabinet.  Hesitantly she opened the cabinet and withdrew the small blue
cylander containing her newly concocted aphrodisiac.
It was half full.

As the color drained from the redhead's face, Noboyuki, of all people, walked in.  "Hello washu, you're out
of the lab alre.." he began

"DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'VE DONE, YOU BABOON?!?"

"I..don..we..I..bu" he stammered in reply, coweing behind the table"

she started to berate him some more, but then realized something and switched tactics. "You may have cost
your only son his virginity!" she accused.

"But I, wha..?"

"right now he's probably off screwing someone!"

"wow.. but how would he get over his.. and how do you know he.."

"This!" she held up the jar in his face.

"The sauce? but I thought it was just a.." she seemed determined not to let him finish a sentence today.

"It's not a sauce! It's a brilliant experiment! You're just lucky it's non-toxic or you'd probabl all
be dead right now."

"Oh" he replied sheepishly. "Then what is it?"

"It's a potent and highly concentrated aphrodisiac." she snapped. "created by yours truly" she stood proudly.

"But we all had some. Does that mean we're.."

"horny as hell"

"I guess that means I'd better go back to my room and sleep it off"

"Actually" she said, whipping out the scanner, "you've ingested enough to keep you horny for about 3 days,
without.. relief" a tempting possibility crossed her mind.

"3 days?! You mean I'll have to be grounded for.."

"Not necessarily." an evil grin spread across her deceptively kawaii face. "I could.. speed up the process
if you came to my lab"

"As long as I don't need to do anything painful."

"Oh, it shouldn't be particularly painful.. For you or me" she added almost silently.

"Well, ok"

"Excellent!" she exclaimed. "Right this way then"
He followed obediently, just like his son.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryoko sat in her spot on the roof and thought.
She tried to think of a plan to get Tenchi tonight.
She tried not to think of the desire growing within her.
It wasn't working.

*Well, there's always the direct approach*
*Then again I've been trying that since I've been here.*
*Mabie if I acted uninterested?*
*Then he'd probably be relieved*
*He might have a dormant sense of voyeurism I could play off*
*That sounds like the best chance yet*
*So how do I trigger it?*
The pirate's yellow feral eyes twinkeled as they looked into the darkness as a distinct plan formed behind
them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tenchi felt very very dry.
At least he'd been let out of the chains.  From what he'd heard that was probably against some custom.
But if she hadn't indulged him that small convenience, he might have had to put up with being dehydrated
until he managed to get to the kitchen for a drink.  Maybe another round or two.
He surreptitiously closed the door and turned to go down the stairs.
The trip was uneventful until he reached his destination, the kitchen.

*I really have to do something about these nosebleeds*

After recovering from the initial shock, he scooped his jaw off the floor and continued to stare, transfixed.

Ryoko was sprawled out on a set of chairs, her eyes closed.  The provrbial jaybird was wearing more than
she had on.

*I really ought to get out of here before she wakes up.* He tried to turn around, but his knees stayed
planted on the floor, having given out by now.

His head swimming, he slowly, shakily, reached out to touch her.  He froze for a second as she shifted
slightly, and then, unable to controll himself any longer, he brought his hand to her opening, reveling in
the sensation for several seconds.
Sunnedly, she sprung to life, and he pulled back reflexively.

"Hmmm, I knew you had it in you Tenchi." she licked her lips and leaned over in his face.

Tenchi managed to stammer something incoherant while staring up at Ryoko's unbelievably sexy body.

"Awww, can't speak? I guess I'm a little too much for you, hmm?" she giggled with pleasure as, for once,
he didn't resist while she scooped him up.  A new idea came to her suddenly, and she sent a telepathic
signal while floating her soon-to-be lover out the door.

"Miya!"  the cabbit, responding to her mistress's call, approached them eagerly.

"What are you?.." Tenchi seemed to have gotten his voice back.

"We're going up" she said as she disengaged herself from Tenchi.  She scooped up her spaceship and threw it
into the air.

"Miyaaaaaooooo" the cabbit transformed quickly into its ship form and immediately transported the couple on
the ground inside itself.

"This is a night you'll remember forever" the space pirate traced her finger around Tenchi's chest as they
dematerialized.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*That's strange* thought the young azure-haired princess as she sat under the great tree's branches. "I
wonder whu Ryo-Ohki's in ship form now?  Oh well..." she turned her mind once more towards the reason she had
come out to Ryu-Oh in the first place. "Well" she speculated "if I can feel for anybody, I guess It might
even be better than just being normal." as she got up and started to return to the house, she noticed her
sister walking quickly towards the tree.

"What is it Oneesama?" Sasami asked eagerly.

"Have you seen Tenchi recently Sasami?" the princess looked slightly worried.

"No, I haven't, mabie you could ask Ryoko when she comes out." the older girl wore a confused look.
"Up there, I'm sure Ryoko's inside Ryo-ohki." she pointed towards the small crystaline shape in the sky.

*hmm...* Aeka stood staring into the sky as her sister walked away.  Suddenly, her eyes widened as she
realized something.  The princess of Jurai's cry filled the night.

"RRYYYOOOKKOOOOO!!"

So, how was it?
