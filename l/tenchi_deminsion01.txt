DOOR!
The boy reaches out and opens the door only to be trampled bye Tenchi.
"Run, man, run there coming." Tenchi yells to the boy. The boy sits up
to

door. The boy reaches up and slams the door shut. The takes off following

boy reaches a plain were Tenchi is breathing heavily. But the boy didn't
break a sweat.
"Hey man," The boy says walking up.
"Hey my name's tenchi whats yours"
"Koran, hey tenchi what was that"

"Give me Tenchi" Koran says extending his hand.
"No! Why should I!" Ryoko says
Koran Points one finger at a tree and it blows up "Thats why."
"Big deal" Sudddenly koran puts the palm of his hand up and Boom A whole

mountian goes sky high. Floating in midair it explodes.
"Damnnnnnnn" Ryoko whistle as koran flys to the ground with tenchi. He
lands with tenchi and goes over to Ayeka to wake her up. She fainted cause
the tree he exterminated was kinda close to her. She was leaning on it.
As The walk home Koran make sure the two girls stay in line. After They
were home Koran relucteedly wen't in.
"Hey everyone, Come in the living room. We have a visitor!"
"A visitor!" A little voice comes from the kicten.
Kosuhito and Nobuati were planing chess. "It appears tenchi has found
another friend," Kosuhito says "Mabey another Girlfriend"
"Another One" Suddenly Nobuati looks very excited
"Greatgamedadyouwin.Buygottogomeettenchi'sfriend"
Kasuhito sighs as he gets up from the game, To meat tenchis new freind.

"Hey wait, Tenchi has a guest over!" Mieosi tels the excited

Even Washu came out of her lab to examine the new friend. Soon every body
but
Ryoko and Ayeka was gathered. Koran Leaned agianst the wall not with his
head

"Please tell me these are your relitives"
"Um no actually my realitives a dad and Ghour of Experimenting, deal."
koran says.
"How did you. . ." Washu puzzeled
"Your a genius figure it out."
7:45 am
"Okay I got every thing I need, except for a" Washu says
"Fuck No!" Koran exclaimes
"Just one sample. . . I really need that sperm sample!"
"Nooo!!"
"Fine, Do with out the dimension" Washu says teasingly
"Theres no way im gonna get a blow job from a little 12 year old, cause
she needs a sample!"
Suddenly Washu changes into adult form, "What about now?" Koran mouth
hangs open
"Holy Shit. . . ." Suddenly he snaps outof it "No!"
"Pleaseeeee" See asks
"Uhhh No!" Koran can fell his dick getting harder as Washu strips down
exposing her naked body
"Come on, You know you want to. . ." Washu says in a sly voice leaning
her body agianst Koran.
KOran scrunches his face up. "I said No!" Suddenly a golden glow engulfs

his body and the platform holding him shattered. He Screamed as the aroura
grew. It engukfed and destroyed every thing around him.
"AhhhhhAHAhaHAAHHHHH!' He screams
"Oh My Lord!" Washu exclaimes and sits at he consol she furiously scans
every inch of the aroura and its power. "Amazing, Astonding!" Washu
says.
Suddenlt a laser blows up a machine right beside Washu. Koran Has his hand
held out toward the machine. "If that was planned to friten me, Im sorry,
It
fail" Washu said looking up from the consol grinning "It only Intriges
me"
"Hum" Koran says in a So what voice
"And before you go destroying my lab I should tell you fact. I was kicked
out of science acadamy cause i created a weapon that could destroy planets
in
the press of a button. I love destruction, It makes me so horny"Washu said

Koran is taken back bye this. Then I fires another blast at some giant
machine. Koran smirks.
"Koran, Are you impling something" Washu said slightly blushing
"I really need that training demension, So test away. Get the sample if
you want." Koran said. Koran smirks and his eyes turn a green color. His
hair
floats up and it turns yellow. He grows twice his size and his clothes rip
of
his body, revealing his muscular design, and his mighty oak. "This is a
Transformation of the sayian blood, It is called a supersayian."
Washu stands up from her floating cousion. And she leans agianst his
body. And raises up to kiss Koran but her stops her. "I said You could get

the smaple, I didn't say I'd have sex with you."
"Oh okay" Washu sighs, then mutters "That takes all the fun out of it.
.
."  She places her clit on top of Koran's harden penis. And slightly
gasps,
The she begins to go back and forth, letting Korans dick go in and out.
Washu
can hear Korans breath getting louder and faster. She continues to hump
Koran. Koran fells is climax aproaching. Though he trys to keep it seem as
his he is not coropating Washu sees hints of pleaser poke through his
stonehard face. And he suddenly reaches up and graps one of Washus boncing
breast and begins to gently masage it. He reache back and graps washus firm
ass. He helps he go back and forth.
"Ohhh, Oh fuck washu," Koran utters. It was to late to turn back now. He

fells the sticky substance coming out. Suddenly in a swift motion Washu
stops
pulls out and is holding a small becker at korans penis. Suddenly cum sprays

out of koran, after the beacher fill Washu happily runs back to her consol
and puts the beaker in a slot were she begins to analize it.
"Hey," Koran says as he gets his breath back "What about the training
demension" "Oh right," Washu punches in some key and a door appears.
The
see punches some more keys, Koran suspects adding what he asked for.
"All done she says" Washu says then turns back to her data.
Koran walks into the training room. To his shock it is an endless plain
of white that reaches forever. "Shit" He utters He looks around Were he
came
from there is the only structure, It has a shower, a bed, a cabinet, a
refidgerator, and a computer consol. "Thats strange, I wonder why Washu
added
a bed?" koran walked over to the consol. It had the Time flow control, a
gravity altering devise, a medical aid kit, a program simulator, a training
wieght creation unit  and a Cybord Assembly and control unite.
"Nice. . ." Koran Turned the Gravity to x100 and a simulator to a desert

plain. He made a pair of 10lb. He Jumped into the training area and began to

train intensly.
8:05 a.m.
Quietly Ryoko sneckes into Washus Lab. She finds the door that leads to
Washu. Washu is siting at he consol humming happily. Ryoko phases to a near
bye door and checks it. She recalls the conversation she had with Sasami.
FlashBack
"Oh hey Ryoko, you just missed Koran. He went to Washus, To ask about a
training simulators." Sasami say as she puts a load of pancakes in front
of
Ryoko. Ryokos not very surpised that  Koran knew that she wanted to know
what
was for breakfast. And then he was right.
"Wait a sec Sasami, Did you say Training simulators" Ryoko says suddenly

ful of entuseasum
"Yeah, Also he grumbled something about being tested on." Sasami said
fixing more pancakes.
'Yes' Ryoko thought happily 'Now I can prove to Koran how strong I am.

But wait, If Koran was going to get experimented on. . .Washu would stop at
nothing till she had evrything! Oh Well, I pity Washu'
End Flashback. . .
Inside Ryoko saw a desert plain, and in the middle koran was training, He
was throwing punches and kicks, doing flips and firing blast.
"Ha. .That what he calls a training program? I'll so him." Ryoko said
walking into the desert plain, but suddenly see fell to the ground. It feels

like someone dropped a whole load of gravity on her back. She trys to stand
up but she simply cant move.
"Hel.l.lpp" Ryoko mutters.
Koran looks up from his training and gasp suddenly he appears right bye
Ryoko and begins to pick her up but stops when she screams. The desides to
turn down the gravity back to normal.
"My God! Are you alright Ryoko?" Koran askes as he helps Ryoko over to
the bed.
"Let go of me" Ryoko said and jerked her arm away. But Koran caught her
as she fell.
Koran placed Ryoko on the bed. "Why the hell did you come in her? You
sould of known that 100x gravity was way to much for you." Koran said
concerningly while he got out the Medical Aid Kit.
"Get away from me! I came here to battle you, and battle you i shall
do!" Ryoko say standing up but yelps out in pain and falls back.
"But, but why. . .Ryoko. . .why? I dont understand, I just wanted to be
your friend" Koran questions stumped.
"Because you treat me like a fragile object, and a childs plaything. Your
always breaking into my mind, and proving how strong you are. . .I will show

I can be stronge to!" Ryoko shouts. Koran quietly reachs into his pouch
and
pulls out a little green bean
"Here, eat this it will restore your health." Koran slips the bean into
ryokos mouth. She swallows it and suddenly the pain is gone. She gets up for

a second, wondering if it was some kind of trick. But soon finds out its
not.
"Well I must thank you" Ryoko says getting to her feet. "Butr I will
still whoop your ass"
"Okay" Koran says getting up facing Ryoko. " I promise I will never
read
your mind agian, and I will treat you like a true warrior" KOran turns on
his
aroura, "Now we fight"
KOran sets the gravity level to x10 figuring thats all Ryoko can handle
and walks into the training ground "Simulation- Dense Forest" Suddenly
that
dry craked desert plain, Melts away to a moist rain forest. Ryoko steps into

that gravity, the gravity pushes her down some, but not nearly as much as
before. She can withstand this.
Sudddenly Koran dissapears and Ryoko gets hit in the back falling
forward.  Ryoko struggels her way up but a sudden stab of pain in the gut
from Koran makes her fall back agian. Koran dissapears to the gravitron.
"It appears, Ryoko, that this gravity is holding you down. Mabey we
should adjust" Koran turns the gravity to normal.  Suddenly ryoko phases
right infront of Koran.
"Eat this" She fires an attack at koran but he blurs away.
"I'm not gonna let you win!" Ryoko starts fired attacks every
whichway.
Koran dodges the all. Suddenly a loud roar penatraits the jungle and a
fierce
T-Rex steps out. Ryoko notices something terrible one of the monsters eyes
are scarred.
"Oh shit! Ryoko you hit it" Koran yells and blurs. When he reappears He
is in front of the giant dinosaur, protecting Ryoko.
"What the hell are you doing!?" Ryoko yells at Koran as he stands in the

way of the rampaging dino.
"KAME. . ." Koran puts his hands in a cupped posistion at his side. The
T-Rex is 20 yards away now "HAME" A ball of Ki energy appears in between

Koran's hands. The Rex is right on top of them now he bends down to
enclose
its prey. Koran swings his hands infront of him.
"HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
He yells as a brillent blue light radiates of his hand. Engulfing the T-rex
The Kamehameha attack slowly forced the rex back, but it also through Ryoko
across the room because of the termendous force. The dinosaur dissapeared in

the blue energy as his life was being ripped from him.
When the attack stops and the dust settles a Broken batterd bloodly
Tyranosaurs rex seckeleton falls the the ground. Then Koran relaxs still
breathing hard he takes a Senzu bean, He looks around. Ryoko's body is
thrown
agianst the Bed.
Koran walks over and picks her up and places her on the bed. Quiekly he
feeds her a senzu bean. even though the properties of a senzu bean heals
her,
she is still psysically exasted and drift asleep.
As she falls asleep Ryoko mummbles "Stop it, stop taking me away from
tenchi" "Ryoko, I'm not taking you anywhere" Koran say bewildered
"Stop it, stop making me fall in love with you. . . ."
