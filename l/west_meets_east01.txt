                             The West Meets The East: No Need for The West
                                        By: Universal Escape
<So this is Japan> Mike thought to himself. It somehow was wasn't like what
he thought it
would be. What he saw were tiny houses cramped into a small space of a
square mile. <Sheesh...
 and i thought zero lot lines were bad!!> thinking about how his house back
in "The States"...
Boca Raton, Florida (aka Snob Capital of... If not the World then America),
if you must know,
that was at least 5 feet from the next door neighbors) wasnt so cramped
compared to this.
It was his first time out of The States. He was getting sick and tired of
seeing many BMWs,
Mercedes', Lexus', even Lamborgini's every day. He was sick and tired of all
the fights about
who was better and wealthear and the bragging all the teens did about their
cars, which their
parents bought them, like they had all the money in the world. He liked it
here. Sure there
was an occasional snob here and there, but not like back home.

                                      * * * * * * *
Mike had only been in Japan for a day and a half and he had already seen
most of
the major siteseeing places like Mt. Fuji, and the likes. He even got a
chance to tour
some of his favorite video game console factories (Sony Playstation 2 was
his all time
favorite... so far). One thing he noticed about the locals... they were all
around the
same height... How could you not notice from being a 6ft 6in 'giant.' He got
used to the
fact that he was usually the only one around from the West Side.

                                      * * * * * * *
The rest of the day, Mike was getting tired of the hussle and bussle of the
city he was
calling home for this short time and wanted to see the beauty of this now
familiar land.
But first... He took out his bong and light up like tomorrow would never
come. Hit after hit
got into his system. When he was done, he followed a road to the outskirts
of the city but
kept walking. It felt like he had been walking for hours... <The fuck? This
sure as Hell
aint like me> he thought to himself about how long he has been walking for.
In the distance,
he saw what looked like a tree. "A TREE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LAKE?!?" he said,
flabbergasted.
<I gotta remeber to lay off the fucking weed!! My eyes are bullshitting me.>
"Aww fuck it!
I feel like i can Fly!!! I FEEL LIKE A MILLION BUCKS!!! he yelled. He
started to run towards
the tree that he now saw was on an island in the middle of the lake. The
weed was taking
over his mind now and he felt like he wanted to fly, not float like the
morphine made him feel
earlier. The second he realized he couldn't fly... he found himself splash
like a whale into the
lake. He had jumped what felt like 8 feet into the air and crashed into the
water.

                                      * * * * * * *
It was a normal day in the Maski household. As usual Sasami was cooking
another one of her
GREAT meals with Ryo-oki eating a... carrot... (DUH!). Mihoshi and Kiyone
were on their rounds
(GP  scouting rounds that is). Tenchi was at the Shrine sweeping and
training. Ayeka and Ryoko
were fighting like always, but this time it wasnt over Tenchi. We will never
know what they
were fighting about cause they didnt really remember what it was about after
they started.
(CONFUSING HUH?)

                                      * * * * * * *
As the two fought outside the Masaki house (fists and feet and teeth) they
heard a splash from
the lake. They stopped fighting for a moment. Wondering what happened they
inched their way to
the lake. What they saw made them sweat a big anime sweat drop. <It's
another boy.. er.. guy!>
thought Ayeka and Ryoko. When Mike noticed them he was starteld. "Damn!!!
Now I know my
eyes are Bullshitting me!!! What he saw were two beautiful young ladies. "I
never saw beauty
like this." he said. "TWO BEAUTIES!!! I LOVE JAPAN!!!!" he yelled. As he
said this both Ayeka
and Ryoko blushed.

                                      * * * * * * *
Ayeka and Ryoko helped him out of the water and got him a towel. They both
took an arm and led
him to the house. Once inside Mike noticed there were more beautiful young
ladies around. Six to
be exact. "Fuck the States... with this much beauty around im staying here."
he said to himself.
He got up with Ayeka and Ryoko following him everywhere he went. When he
enterd the kitchen he
noticed an oh so cute little blue haird girl cooking what smelled like the
steaks his mom made
back home. When Sasami noticed him she screamed. Terrified, Mike ran like a
bat outta hell. He
crashed into Tenchi who was done training and was hungry. Falling on his
backside, Mike held
his nose like it was broken. "Its bleeding but it isnt broken." Washu told
the newcomer, popping
out of nowhere and examining his nose. Tenchi was standing over him with
wonder in his eyes.
<Whos this guy?!> Tenchi thought. Nobuyuki, and Katsuhito made their way
into the house not
expecting company.

                                      * * * * * * *
Mike, was still on the weeds influences but it was dying now. He wore a FUBU
shirt and JNCO
jeans, unlike the others kimonos and stuff. Much to his liking, he was the
only one not in any
japanese clothing. Sleep came over him in seconds. When he awoke a few hours
later, he paniked.
Not knowing where he was and how he got here, he got up and ran for the
door. Ryoko phased in
front of him just before he reached the exit. Not noticing her, he crashed
into her. Again
he fell on his ass and swore like a street punk. "What the fuck?!?" "Where
in fucking hell am
I?!?" "Where am I?" "And who the fuck are you?!?" Mike was sweating like a
pig. As everyone
heard the yelling, they came running to see what had happened.

                                      * * * * * * *
Mike looked around the room, seeing about ten faces staring at him. "Shit!"
he said "I don't
remember a thing. Oh... yeah... the weed..." he said nodding to himself.
Worry turned to
confusion on the ten faces. "Well now that everybody is here" said
Katsuhito, "why dont we
introduce ourselves to our guest? The Introductions started with Katsuhito.
Then Nobuyuki,
welcoming the stranger into his house. Then Tenchi, who smiled a hello. Then
came the six
beauties. Ayeka, first Princess of Jurai, <Jurai??? Oh well at least she is
CUTE!!> Mike thought;
Sasami, second Princess of Jurai <a little too young but was a beauty none
the less>; Ryoko,
infamous EX-Space Pirate <somewhat mean as hell to Ayeka>; Mihoshi, Galaxy
Police, First
Class <somewhat of a dumb blonde>; Kiyone, GP, First Class <Nice face and
body!>; Washu,
GREATEST scientist in the Universe <what the, what is THAT?> Mike wondered
to himself. He felt
something when Washu spoke to him. But what? "Well, it's gonna take me a
while to remember all
your names. Oh yeah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Mike, Normal Human
from Florida, USA."

                                      * * * * * * *
Washu felt it too. A bond kinda like with Ryoko but stronger... somehow. She
created another
dimensional room for Mike. <I think she went OVERBOARD!!!> he thought to
himself as
he entered the door. The room was HUGE! A KING size bed, a really big
dresser, double windows
were just a few of the things you could find in the room.

                                      * * * * * * *
Everyone was curious about Mike. They found a lot about him at dinner. Mike,
just learning how
to use chopsticks, had a hard time eating and was the last one to leave the
table. That gave
Sasami and Mihoshi some time to chat with him while they cleaned the dishes.
They learned about
where he lived and what a hell he thought it was, and about his family. He
learned about
Jurai, how they all came to meet, Kagato, and other stuff.
