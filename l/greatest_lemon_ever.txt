The Characters in Tenchi Muyo! do not belong to me and are not my 
creations...This is my attempt
 to write a Lemon fic all in one sentence.
Now on with the fic.



                The Greatest Lemon Ever!


    One day Tenchi walked down the stairs and  he saw Ryoko and they did it 
and then he walked
in the kitchen and saw Sasami and they did it and then Tenchi walked outside 
and he saw
Aeka and they did it and then Tenchi went to the carrot patch and he saw 
Ryo-Ohki and
they did it cabbit style and then he saw Nobuyuki and they didn't do it and 
then Tenchi went
to school and saw Sakuya and they did it and on Tenchi's way home he met Nagi 
and they did
it and then Tenchi went to bed.


Taadaa! The stupidest fic ever!!!  Thank you very much.  Send all replies to
