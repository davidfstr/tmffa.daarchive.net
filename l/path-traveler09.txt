The Path Of The Traveler IX:
Trouble In Paradise


                   (Opening Theme: Stars Falling - Smashing Pumpkins)


 (Theme slowly fades to the end where we come to the opening scene)

  Four day's had passed since the unwanted visitor had invaded Omega
reuniting Ryoko and Verijsha. They were closing in on earth.
  Ryoko's eyes slowly cracked open to the darkness of the small cubbyhole
like bed compartment. She smiled looking at, feeling on her hand, Verijsha's
chest going up and down. Ryoko watched Verijsha's face, eyes close, mouth
gaping open just a small bit. So beautiful in it's own way, so tranquil, she
dared not wake him up.
  Ryoko slowly, quietly, crawled out of the bed; she put herself in a
strait, erect position. She walked down the cold, metal halls, phasing into
her clothes. Though it looked more like the clothes phased on her.
  Ryoko looked around the ship looking for the kitchen, she still didn't
know her way around.
  She walked by one of the doors that lead to the ships main bridge. She
stopped looking at a sign that was posted on the metallic auto-opening
sliding door.
  Bridge Under Repair, Closed Sector.
  "Open the doors, Omega."
  "I cannot, miss Ryoko."
  "Why not?"
  "Inside is under repair, you might get hurt."
  "Pfft," Ryoko phased through the door then stopped dead cold.
  (Super Freak - Rick James)
  She stared down at one of the control panels, staring directly at two
naked breasts. They were perfect and round, beautiful milky skin surrounded
the pink erect nipples. They jiggled slightly as the owner of the breasts
worked with her flashlight and mini torch.
  Ryoko couldn't help herself; she stared down as the blue haired owner sat
up. The beautiful woman stroked her fingers through her long beautiful dark
blue hair.
  Ryoko kept her eyes on the woman's breast as she stood up. The woman had
the skintight leather-like uniform pants on, like Ryoko herself had been
prancing around in.
  The woman looked into Ryoko's golden eyes with her soothing emeralds. The
woman noticed she couldn't get eye contact; Ryoko stared in amazement at her
breasts.
  "They're only tits." The woman squeezed Ryoko's right breast, "I see you
have some to."
  Ryoko jumped, startled that the woman had grabbed her breast.
  "Hi. Didn't you notice the sign on the door?"
  "W-Who is you?"
  "My name is Tseru."
  "What are you doing on this ship?"
  "Fixing the damn thing."
  "Ok, what are you doing on the ship?"
  "I live here."
  "Then why haven't I seen you?"
  "Because, while you were prancing around with Verijsha, I was working my
ass off to make sure that Omega's Systems were 100%"
  Ryoko focused on Tseru, for the first time in the conversation she
processed that Tseru had an accent much like Ayeka's, Much tougher of
course, not lady like.
  Tseru, seemingly pissed stuffed a cigarette in her mouth. She checked
herself.
  "Damn, no match."
  Ryoko stared at her in utter disbelief. She found it a bad time to smoke.
  "Just who the hell are you?" Ryoko looked at her questioning.
  "I told you, I am Tseru."
  "I don't mean that!"
  At that point the door opened and Verijsha stepped through the metallic
doorjambs. Ryoko looked back and phased just a few feet in front, the look
on her face testy. Her eyes seethed into Verijsha's.
  "What's Happening?"
  Before Ryoko could respond, Tseru appeared in front of Verijsha, between
Ryoko, and him. "Nothing. Lover." Tseru took out her unlit cigarette, and
locked Verijsha in a long slow kiss.
  Ryoko felt her eyes water, she could not speak, and she ran passed
Verijsha, through the metal halls.
  Verijsha grabbed Tseru's shoulders, "What the fuck are you doing?"
  "Better hurry," Tseru laughed.
  Verijsha's eyes widened, and he ran for Ryoko.
  Tseru stuffed the cigarette back into her mouth. She looked at her
mini-torch. She put it to her cigarette, and turned it on, high. The flames
fly high burning up the cigarette. She groaned and spit it out.

                **********************************************

  Verijsha chased after Ryoko. He slid and turned a sharp corner that lead
to a hallway, to a hull door, there he found Ryoko. He chased her and
grabbed her arm.
  "Let go Of Me." Ryoko commanded.
  "No! Listen, she is not my."
  Ryoko slowly looked up, her voice slowly and majestically turned to song.

  "You and me
  We used to be together
  Every day together always"

  ("We still are!" Verijsha exclaimed.)

  I really feel
  I'm losing my best friend

  ("You're Not!" Verijsha intersected once more.)

  "I can't believe
  This could be the end!"

  ("It's Not!")

  "It looks as though.
  You're letting go
  And if it's real,
  Well I don't want to know."

  (Verijsha tried to intercept, but Ryoko screamed at him in Song.)

  "Don't speak!
  (Ryoko hit Verijsha with a powerful backhand, as He tried to reach for
her)
  I know just what you're saying!
  So please stop explaining!
  (Ryoko's eyes welled up in tears.)
  Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!
  Don't speak!
  I know what you're thinking!
  I don't need your reasons
  Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!
  (Ryoko Buried Her Face In Her Hands as she leaned, her arms in front of
her face, he head buried in them, facing toward the hull door.)

  (Ryoko Lifted Her Head.)
  Our memories
  They can be inviting
  But some are altogether
  Mighty frightening.

  As we die, both you and I
  With my head in my hands
  I sit and cry
  (Streams of Tears fled down Ryoko's face, as Verijsha put his hand on her
shoulder. Verijsha Opened His Mouth Slowly.)

  (Ryoko spun around quickly, hitting his hand away from her.)
  Don't speak!
  I know just what you're saying.
  So please stop explaining
  (More tears caressed her cheek.)
  Don't tell me 'cause it hurts!
  Don't speak
  I know what you're thinking
  I don't need your reasons
  Don't tell me 'cause it hurts

  It's all ending
  I gotta stop pretending who we are...
  You and me
  I can see us dying ... are we?

  Ryoko released of his grip, pulled back and slapped him with authority.
"Go and be with your whore!" Ryoko couldn't believe herself, she sounded
like Ayeka when she said that.
  "She's not my whore, nor is she my Lover! Tseru is the other owner of this
ship!"
  "Yeah, right!" Ryoko tried sobbing.
  "Listen, give me just a minute."
  "Omega!" Ryoko called, for by now, Omega listened to her commands, "Set a
timer for sixty seconds, go."
  Verijsha groaned at her. Verijsha started slowly. "Well. You See. It. Felt
Like Spring Time, This February Morning.
  Ryoko lifted her head, looking as Verijsha's golden eyes.
  Verijsha slowly changed his voice into song.

"In a courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel all right
I carried them with me today
Now

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Though i am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot, barely breathing

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Oh, darlin'
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

When the sun comes out again....
I will wake up happy....
This I pray...."

  Ryoko gently put her hands on his face; she lifted his head up, "Times
Up." She locked him in a long passionate kiss, believing him, finally.

                **********************************************

  "Tenchi!" Washu called.
  "Yes?" Tenchi walked to her.
  "Now, Tenchi, people have been becoming suspicious, because you're staying
her, you've got to go."
  "Why?"
  "You need to be with your wife! You've been spending your honeymoon with
me! Listen Tenchi, you gotta go. ok?"
  "Fine," Tenchi started to walk out of the lab. Tenchi turned his head
back, to see Washu pointing her finger forward, out the door. Tenchi opened
the door to the outside, and then slipped out of the large dark lab.
  Tenchi slipped out, to find his green hair wife, sitting on the couch,
looking blank, he hadn't seen her in a week, and he wanted to hold her. He
rushed to her, but she stopped him with her hand. She turned to him with
eyes that would strike fear in the eyes of Hades himself!
  "Just where were you this past week?"
  "Uh. In Washu's lab." Tenchi pointed.
  "And just what were you doing in there that was more important then me?"
She stood up in bitter anger.
  "Nothing! Nothing is more important than you!" Tenchi stepped foreword,
nobly.
  "Then Why Didn't you bother to see me in a week?" Kiyone said, Tears
streamed down her eyes, looking at her husband.
  There were no words that could form to his mouth.
  "Your new wife. You didn't even bother to see me!" Kiyone cupped her hands
over her eyes, stepping back, and then turning around, running.  Tenchi
heard the feet clanging against the stairs; he plumped down into the nearest
chair, looking at the ground. Tears stained the ground as he remembered,
nearly a week ago.

                **********************************************

  Tenchi glided one foot in front of the other, slowly walking through the
woods.
  "Tenchi." A voice called. The voice was but a whisper, a silent soft
whisper. Tenchi's ear's almost perked to the sound.
  "Who Is It? W-who's there!" Tenchi Demanded, turning to the sound.
  "Come Tenchi."
  Tenchi Tried To Resist, but his feet glided under him. He walked towards
the voice.
  Just as he reached to the thick trunk of an oak tree, he looked around,
his head waving quickly. No one was there.
  Then, just as he was about to move on, two feet hit the ground behind him.

  Tenchi spun around just to see two glowing golden eyes, with red pit and
whites. The rest was covered under a hood, as was the body.
  "Who are you?" He Yelled.
  "You will be the death of her, Tenchi." The voice came out of the hood.
  "Who?"
  "Her."
  Tenchi's eyes lit up in sudden understanding, "Kiyone!" he whispered.
  "Yes."
  "I don't believe you!"
  "Stay away from her!" The voice became a booming whisper.
  Tenchi Stepped Back.
  He had remembered doubting, but believing. The person disappeared as
quickly as it had appeared.

                **********************************************

  Snap. Snap. Snap.
  "Tenchi!" Tenchi heard a familiar voice, masculine.
  Tenchi looked up into two golden eyes. He almost jumped back, the looked
once more; it was the brown haired warrior, Verijsha.
  "What are you thinking about that's got you zoned out?" Verijsha looked in
inquiry.
  "Can't you read my mind?" Tenchi disguised his emotion into a smirk.
Tenchi laughed half-heartedly, then embraced Verijsha. "Welcome back."
  "Thanks," Verijsha said breaking out of the hug. "Are those bruises ok?"
  "They're fine."
  Ryoko floated behind Verijsha, and behind her were the rest of the girls
(Excluding Kiyone,) asking question, like, "How was it?" Or, "Did you.?"
  Which Ryoko Gave no regard to, all she did was hug Verijsha from behind.
  "Hey, honey." She looked around, "Where's Kiyone?"
  "Fight, it seems."
  "You did read my mind." Tenchi looked up, almost angered.
  "Part of it." Verijsha said Ominously, looking at him, and yet, it seemed
he looked passed him.
  Verijsha straitened up.
  "Ryoko," Verijsha said walking towards the stairs, "Talk to him, I'm going
to have talk with his wife."
  Verijsha stepped up the stairs. Slowly glide by glide, feeling the
intensity of the emotion, step by step.

                **********************************************

  Tear, a point of pure emotion, emotion not with a control. Emotion
belonging to a wife, whose husband she thought had betrayed her.
  Kiyone laid on her husband and hers bed. She tears strode down the picture
of hers and Tenchi's. The bed stained with tears.
  Knocks Rapped at the door.
  "GO AWAY!" she yelled, partially muffled by her tears.
  Slowly she heard feet come against the carpet, she raised her head, to see
Verijsha standing over her.
  "Welcome back," she said hollowly.
  "What's wrong?"
  "Nothing!" She yelled at Verijsha, quickly flipping around, looking out
the window.
  "Come on. Don't try to fool me. You know."
  "You can read minds!" She mocked.
  "I know what you're going through."
  "How can you possibly.!"
  "I'm older than I look. I have seen and felt what you are going through."
Verijsha looked at her. "At least you didn't lose anybody." Verijsha added,
sadly.
  "I did."
  "You didn't lose anybody," Verijsha shook his head, "You lost trust."
  "It's the same thing," Kiyone scowled through her tears, "Now, just go
down there and tell Tenchi to FUCK that Smart-ass BITCH all that he wants!
As far as I'm concerned, THIS MARRIAGE IS OVER!" Kiyone Yelled.
  Verijsha slowly backed through the door, slipping through it. He walked
down the stairs.
  Verijsha made his way to Tenchi, sitting across the coffee table from him.

  "Everyone, Leave!" He alerted.
  With that, knowing that Verijsha was unmovable when he did this, they left
for an adjacent room.
  Tenchi started to stand up, His head drooped in a mope.
  "Not You!"
  Tenchi Sat back down, and forced his head up.
  Verijsha noticed the red puffy spot under his eyes, indicating crying.
  Verijsha took his mini castor out of his holster and put it down on the
table. Then he took out a pack of cigarettes, opening it up, pulling out one
cigarette, and putting the pack down. The dug into his pocket and retrieved
a lighter (Butane style.) Verijsha flipped the cap and lit his cigarette,
then put down his lighter.
  Verijsha pulled the cigarette out of his parched lips.
  "Tenchi, I'm going to ask you a couple questions, and don't lie, got me?"
Verijsha said pointing the cherry of the cigarette at him.
  Tenchi nodded.
  "Ok, first of all. Did you have an Sexual Relations With Washu?"
  "No!" Tenchi looked at him, to see if he was kidding.
  "Thought not. Do you Love Your Wife?"
  "Yes."
  "Did you do this in intensions to hurt her?"
  "No."
  "Ok. Did you do this to escape her."
  "Yes. and No."
  "What do you mean?"
  "Somebody told me I would kill her."
  "Ah. The leads to the biggie. Why?"
  Tenchi took a deep breath. "Can I have one of those?" Tenchi looked at the
pack.
  "No."
  Tenchi sighed because this was a long story and it was hard to tell, and
he thought that might calm his nerves.
  Tenchi then proceeded to tell the story, End to End. He told about the
person he talked to in the woods, about the warning, everything.
  "That's it." Tenchi said at the end.
  Verijsha nodded as he lit his now fourth cigarette.
  "You have not lied, I can tell." Verijsha stood up. Verijsha grabbed
Tenchi by the back of his collar dragging him up the stairs.
  "What are you doing?"
  "You're going to make up with her, now!"
  "What?"
  Verijsha pulled him up the stair into his room, and then grabbed the knob.
Slowly turning it, then opening it.
  "Can we talk.?" Tenchi started, and then was thrown into the room, the
door shutting behind him.
  Tenchi looked up and stared at Kiyone, whose first reaction was concern,
then anger. Kiyone picked up a pillow and threw it at Tenchi, "Get out," she
spited. Then flipped over not facing him on the bed.
  "Kiyone." Tenchi got to his knees, after being pelted with a pillow, he
crawled, "I'm sorry, I. I." Tenchi felt his voice lift up in song.

"I was as wrong as I could be
To let you get away from me
I'll regret that move for as long as I'm living
But now that I've come to see the light
All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word
And tell me that I'm forgiven

(Tenchi stood up and started to walk to her, her eyes softening to his
voice.)

You and me
We're gonna be
Better than we were before
I loved you then
But now I intend
To open up
And love you even more
This time you can be sure

(Tenchi finally made it to the bed, then he knelt down to her, embracing her
in a hug, then holding her.)

I'm never gonna let you go!
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
(Kiyone slowly turned around, tears of happiness coming from her eyes. She
slipped her feet off the bed, then with Tenchi She stood up, hugging his
chest as he held her and sang.)
Gon-na
Hold your body close to mine!
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

Looking back now it seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted
But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love that still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

(Tenchi Took Kiyone and started to dance around the room.)

Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then but now I intend
To dedicate myself to giving more
This time you can be sure

(Tenchi swung Kiyone to him, hugging her with all his might.)

I'm never gonna let you go!
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Gon-na
Hold your body close to mine!
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go!

So if you'll just say you want me too...

I'm never gonna let you go!
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Gon-na
Hold your body close to mine!
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go!

Never gonna let you go!
Hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so
Hold your body close to mine!
From this day on we're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go!

  Tenchi's voice Slowly stopped singing. Tenchi stared into her eyes, filled
with tear, tears of happiness; they finally pulled together and embraced in
a long kiss.

                **********************************************

  Day's passed; Tenchi and Kiyone had not left their room, the pleasure of
being with each other. They need little more.
  Verijsha sat on the coffee table, across from him Katsuhito, Ryoko floated
above them, watching. A chessboard in between them, the pieces scatted out
in a tactical pattern.
  Katsuhito's voice arose, "Chess, unlike many games, takes tactics,
understanding, and experience," He said, picking up a piece and putting it
down.
  Verijsha nodded, picking up a piece, then himself, putting it down,
"Checkmate."
  "Huh?" Katsuhito Scanned the board, he was right!
  Verijsha stood up, pulling out a cigarette, then his lighter, flipping the
top and lighting it. "That's thirteen wins thus far," Verijsha laughed, "You
know what the pathetic thing is? You've been playing this game all your
life."
  Verijsha walked off, quickly followed by his Lover, Ryoko, who hugged him
from the back.
  Verijsha looked up stairs to see the door finally opened, Kiyone and
Tenchi walked out, then down the stairs.
  "I'm hungry," he said slowly.
  "I bet you are. you animal," Kiyone smiled at him, "Sit down, I'll get us
something to eat." Kiyone walked into the kitchen.
  Tenchi sat down at the dinner table, quickly joined by Verijsha.
  Verijsha looked at Ryoko, "Could you excuse us for a minute?"
  Ryoko nodded and disappeared.
  Verijsha looked at Tenchi a pushed a plane ticket on the table towards
him. "I want you to go on your honeymoon and don't come back until you two
are good and ready, ok?"
  "But what about."
  "Don't worry about the rest of us," Verijsha puffed smoke out his lungs,
"Leave tommorow, have a great time."
  Tenchi Looked at it and smiled, It was a First Class Ticket to Hawaii.
Verijsha stood up and began to walk away.
  "Verijsha?"
  Verijsha stooped, "Yes?"
  "Thank You."


  (Ending sequence) A Picture of Verijsha walking into the set sun, his back
to the camera, the stone of the road beneath his feet. His shadow elongated,
beneath him. Holding his gun over his right shoulder. The other characters
appeared, walking with him one by one. Omega flies over Verijsha's head, and
finally Ryo-Ohki appears on Verijsha's shoulder. The camera zooms in to
Ryo-Ohki smiling and closing eyes. (Accompanied with the Closing Song - Turn
The Page - Mettalica)

  Tenchi stood on the bridge, looking out to the sky, hearing a distant
voice 'I Love You, Tenchi, And I Always Will.'


                                    BUT.

  A steel foot hit's the ground, as another regular foot follows.

  A steel hand pulls back and goes to punch Tenchi.
