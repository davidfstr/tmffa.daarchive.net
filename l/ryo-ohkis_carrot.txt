   Ya know what? That's the most pathetic phrase I've
ever heard. "Don't sue me." Why's anyone gonna sue ya
in the first place? Sheesh, it's just a story!!
   Oh, yeah!! I'm not making money offa this, but I
wrote it for all you Tenchi fans out there who are
tired of Tenchi getting Ryoko, or Ayeka, or the
others.

   How bout Ryo-ohki?
         "Ryo-ohki's Carrots."
                     by Badjedidude

   Chapt 1: "Confessions"

   All day, Tenchi had been working in the field. Just
working, working, working, working. And, as usual, the
only thing in the field was. . . .You guessed it,
CARROTS!!!

   Tenchi sighed. Why did Ryo-ohki need this many
carrots, anyway? He finished pulling weeds, and got up
off his knees.

   He grabbed his basket, and went throughout the
field,
collecting the biggest, ripest, juiciest carrots. As
he went inside the house, he took his sandals off. He
walked into the kitchen, and set the full basket onto
the floor Sasami looked at it with humongeous eyes,
and she gasped. "HOLY COW!!!"

   Tenchi smiled. "Yeah. . . They just seem to be
getting bigger and bigger. . ."

   Sasami frowned. "Well. . . I'll try to cook 'em,
butwith carrots that size, we'll be stocked into next
month!!"

   Washu came in. "Helloooooooo. . . . . . Tenchi!!
OHHH!!!
Carrots!! Just exactly what I needed for my
experiment!!"

   "What experiment?"

   Washu excitedly grabbed the biggest. "Why, growing
carrots, of course! I'm making a formula that should
turn this baby into a six foot monster!! Course. . .
I'll need a whole batch for a sufficient yield. . .
Whaddya say, Tenchi??"

   The youth sighed. "But Washu, I just came in from-"

   Washu turned into adult form, and moved forward.
She pressed her chest into his, and said, "Pleeease,
My Teeeennchiiii?"

   "Allright." He mumbled. He went back to the door,
put his sandals back on, and went into the fields with
a large basket.

   A few hours later, he came back in, with a full
load. Washu was there, waiting at the door. When she
saw him, she yelped with joy and ran to him. She
grabbed the load.
"Thank you, Tenchi!!" She quickly phased out, and into
her lab.

   Tenchi was clearly releaved at her leaving, so he
decided to take a leisurly walk. He arrived home an
hour later, with Washu waiting at the doors. . .
again. "Hi, Washu. . ."

   The scientist phased to him, grabbed his arm, and
transported them both to her lab. She took his arm,
and led him to a large patch of ground. Huge bushes
were growing in it. Washu pointed. "Look, Tenchi!
Carrots!!"

   Tenchi squinted, staring at the ground. "No, Washu,
those're just bushes-"

  He gasped,for he realized his mistake:
  The bushes were the carrots!!

   A robot came up, and yanked one out of he ground,
revealing a six-foot prize of juicy carrot. Tenchi
almost swooned. "Wow, Washu!! That's really awesome!!"

   "Yeah, and it only took about an hour to grow
them!!" Her face was flushed; She was clearly excited.
"Wow!! Think of the opportunities!!"

   Tenchi just stood there, staring at his work,
outdone in an hour. He smiled and shook his head. <I
guess that's normal for a house having two princesses,
a space pirate, a prince of another world for a
Grandpa, a genius space scientist, two Galaxy Police
Officers, and a spaceship cabbit.> He thought.

   "Ummmm. . . .Tenchi? Why don't you go present this
to Ryo-ohki. Let her try the first carrot used with. .
. WASHUGROW!!!!!"

   "Is that what you called it?"

   She smiled, and he suddenly appeared in the halway,
the huge carrot in a robot's arms. He walked down the
hall, and the robot followed. Ryoko walked up, then
her eyes bulged. "What the hell is that!?!" She
wondered in a
loud voice.

   "Naughty language, Ryoko!!" Sasami said as she came
up. She also gasped. "Oh, my
Juraian Beetle Larvae!! It's a six foot carrot!!" She
yelled. At that moment, Ryo-ohki woke up from a nap
among the rafters.

   She took one look at the thing, and flew down to
Tenchi's feet. "MEEEEOOOOWWW!!!" It yelled. Her yellow
eyes were as big as saucers. She drooled.
"MEEOOOOEWWWWWOOOOOWWREEEWW!!!"

   Tenchi smiled. " Hey, Ry-ohki!! This is for you!!"

   The cabbit pointed at itself. "Meeeeeeoow???"

   Tenchi nodded.

   No sooner had he done this than had the little
thing jumped onto the massive vegetable. It used its
super-appetite, and chomped the entire thing down in a
couple minutes. Then, it flew back up among the
rafters, for a looooooooooong nap.

   The family heard contented burps emmitting from up
there the rest of the night. Tenchi went to bed with a
happy heart.

   It seemed as though the whole family was amazed.
   Tenchi was glad they were happy.

******

   Tenchi woke the next day to find Ryoko above him.
She
was smiling. "Hey, Tenchi. . . Nice day. . . ugh!!"
The space pirate finally fell asleep. She had been
watching him all night again. . .

   Tenchi gulped. One of these nights, he was sure she
would float down into his bed, and-. . . He shuddered
to think what else. <I wonder how Ryo-ohki is doing.
Boy, she sure enjoyed that carrot!! I'll go see if
Washu has another!!>

******

   "Come in, though watch out for that Hybrid-Mark V
stabilizor pitch control."

   Tenchi stepped past the large object, then walked
up to Washu. "Hey, Washu!! What's up?"

   Washu turned, and held out a normal carrot. "This
is from my. . . ummm. . .my garden. I've figured out
some strange effects. The carrots, ummm. . . . They
shrink in about one day.
   That's why these are so. . . so normal. But, since
Ryo-ohki has digested that one, it's still large, in
theory. . ."

   "Oh. . . Well, ummmm. . . . Got another batch?"

   "Yes and no." She held up a basket of carrots,
normal sized. "I had my robots bring these in to test.
But, maybe later."

   As Tenchi left, he noticed that Ryo-ohki sat on the
stairs mewing. "Oh, hi Ryo-ohki!!"

   The cabbit quickly changed into humanoid form.
Tenchi viewed her for a moment. Soemthing seemed. .
.wrong. Was her hair darker? Her smile bigger?

   Ry-ohki came forward, and hugged him. Tenchi
finally found out: In Ryo-ohki's normal humanoid form,
her head only reached his mid-thigh. But, now, she
reached is stomach. He frowned. "Umm, uh. . . .
Thanks."

   He ran to Washu's lab, to report this.

******

   "Hmmmm. . . . So, it affects body growth and
hormones. . . Um, Tenchi? Why don't you eat one, then,
I could-"

   Tenchi held his arms in a defensife posture. "NO
WAY!!"
He yelled, terrified at the thought.

   Washu led a robot out with another carrot. "Here,
feed this to her, and it should stop. If it doesn't,
we're in trouble."

******

   Ryoko looked at the large carrot with lust in her
eyes. "Is that for me?"

   Tenchi frowned. "Get serious, Ryoko." He handed it
to Ryo-ohki, and the cabbit took it, and dissappeared.

   Ryoko looked dissappointed. "H-  how come we
couldn't get it?" Ryoko said, gesturing at Ayeka and
herself. "Aren't we good enough?"

   Tenchi sighed. "That's just the reason. You're both
too good to lose, so Washu is trying them out on
Ryo-ohki."

   Ryoko's cat eyes contracted to slits. "She's
WHAT???" The space pirate flew off to her mom's
laboratory, screaming, "I'M  GONNA  GET YOU, WASHU!!!"

   Tenchi heard a few bangs and bumps, then the cyan
haired woman reappeared. "Oouuuuuch. . ." She mumbled
as she made her way up the stairs.

   Tenchi rolled his eyes, and went to school.

******

   Mr. Humanii smiled, and pointed at Tenchi. "Tenchi
Masaki. . . describe the Red Queen effect." The
teacher smiled at the boy's crazed look.

   "Ummmm. . . Uh, they named it Red Queen, because
in. . .
Ummm. . . Alice and Funland?? The Queen of Hearts
tells Alice she's gotta run to stay in the same place.
   "Ok. . . In Africa,  acacia trees evolved very long
thorns, as a defense. But, this provoked giraffes to
evolve long tongues to get past the thorns. So, they
were back to where they started.
   "Next, the acacia trees evolved to have toxicity.
They started to produce large amounts of tannin in
their leaves. When animals ate it, they'd die.
   "At the same time, these trees evolved a sort of
warning chemical. When one tree was being eaten from,
the tree would release this chemical. All trees
downwind would get the message, and know that soon
they'd be next. So, they stepped up production of
tannin.
   "But, the giraffes and other animals got wise. They
avoid all of the downwind trees, and go to another
tree some distance away.
   "That's what it means. Nature runs to stay in the
same place. Animal eats plant." Tenchi sat down, and
sighed.

   Sometimes it's good to have the most scientific
genius in the galaxy to help you study!!

******

   Washu smiled. "Soooo. . . . They asked you that
today? Good thing ya studied it."

   "Thanks, Was- . . . LITTLE Washu."

   Her smiled grew. She ran up to him in adult form,
and hugged him. "OHHH, Tenchi, I'm sooooo. . . I'm
soooo happy!!"

   After a while, and a few (dangerous) tests, Tenchi
left, to do homework until supper.

******

   Katsohito frowned. "Ryo-ohki? Is that you?"

   "Meeeeooooowwwww!!" The cabbit came into the
shrine. It reared up, and sat before the priest.
"Meww."

   Katsohito looked around. He shook his head.

   Ryo-ohki started to glow, and she meowd. Her form
started to change, growing larger. As this happened,
the cabbit grew curves that enhanced her shape; Curves
that hadn't been there before. Finally, she was done.

   Ryo-ohki, in human form, sat before the priest.
Hair and cat-like nature were gone. She was a
beautiful human, with blue-grey hair, like Ryoko's
though darker.

   Katsohito turned his head from her nude body, and
handed her a green light kimono. "Here you are,
Ryoki."

   Ryoki smiled. She spoke with a sweet voice. "Thank
you, Katsohito. May I change?"

   "Yes, my daughter." (not literally!)

   After a few moments, Ryoki came back, wearing the
kimono. "Well. . . Thank you for planting that idea
into Washu's head. I knew she would do it."

   "Yes. . . It has been written in Jurai prophesies,
that a dangerous space criminal would appear, and
marry the grandson of a Jurai prince. Then, they'd
take the throne, and rule under the Masaki name
forever." The priest said, smiling.

   "And, at first you thought it was Ryoko. After a
while, you'd sensed that I had a higher intellectual
level than a normal cabbit.
   "Then, you knew it was me."

   Katsohito nodded. "I am worried, though. Once Ayeka
and the others find out, they won't be as happy as
you. I think that even Ryoko might leave." He shook
his head. "But, I'm not trying to stop you. More tea?"

   Ryoki nodded. Katsohito continued. "You must do
what your heart tells you to do. I must insist that
you wait a few days, and think it all over.
   "Would you seriously leave Ryoko for Tenchi? I know
that you love him as the rest, but human isn't your
real form. I suppose your children would be inherently
cabbits."

   "Yes. . . Yes, Katsohito. I will think it over.
But, in the end, the choice is not mine to make. It is
the choice of those who control fate."

   The man nodded.
******

   The family sat at the low table, and were eating
supper. 'Sasami's special Carrot Herb Noodles' as the
small chef called it. Ryo-ohki came up to Tenchi, and
sat
on his head, mewing at him.

   "So, Tenchi. . . . How was school?" Asked Ryoko
from his side.

   "Uh, fine."

   "Oh."

   "How was your day, Ryoko?" Tenchi asked back.

   "It was. . .fine. Today, I met a cool space
pirate." She giggled.

   "A SPACE PIRATE!!" Yelled Mihoshi. "Oh, no!! I have
to call-"

   Ryoko glared. "You do, and I'll destroy you."
Mihoshi moaned with sadness, and hung her head.

   "What's his name?" Asked Noboyuki.

   Ryoko giggled again. "His name is. . . uh. . .
Karsommai Kaliarmnimn Hargubai."

   "Quite a long name, Ryoko." Commented Katsohito.

   "Yeah. . . He taught me how to set auxillary
thrusters for maximum safety." She giggled yet again.

   A pang of jealousy ran through Tenchi's veins.
"Yeah, well, be carefull. He might be a-"

   "He's fine." Ryoko barked harshly. She growled.
"You're not the only man in my life!!"

   Tenchi hung his head. Sasami gasped, "Ryoko!!"

   "Well, he thinks that he's the only person I know
and care about. I have. . . I have others." She
stated, turning her head.

   Tenchi frowned at her and nodded. "Fine. I don't
care.
Go have your others!!" The young man jumped up, and
stomped up the stairs. They heard a door slam.

   Ayeka gasped. "Ryoko, that wasn't nic-"

   "Shut up, bit-"

   "Girls. If you must fight, step outside." Katsohito
interrupted.

   Ryo-ohki used her telepathy to talk to Katsohito,
as Ryoko and the princess left. <Did you make Ryoko do
that?>

   <No. That was quite unexpected.> He answered.

   <Space pirate. . .who could it be?> Asked the smart
little cabbit.

   <I have a feeling that it might be. . . Hatsuma.>

   <That servant of Yugi?!?!>

   <I have a feeling that it is, yes. Well, see you
later, Ryo-ohki.> Katsohito got up, and started the
trek to the  shrine.

******

   Meanwhile, Ryoko was in her room, packing. "I hate
him. I think it's time I moved on, I mean, . . .
C'mon!!"

   Ryoko grabbed her stuff, and phased out to
Hatsuma's ship, which was in an outer land hangar. She
came up to him with the suitcase. "Well, Hatsuma. . .
I've decided to join you. . ."

   The man had a gleam in his eye as he took her
luggage.
"Good."

         THE   END

                 "Ryoohki's Carrot"
                         by Badjedidude

   Chapt. 2:  "Ryoko's gone?/ The plot thickens..."

   Tenchi sighed, and looked at his carrot field.
Thanks to Washu's multiple experiments, most of his
carrots were gone. All that was left was a small
mal-nourished carrot. The same carrot Tenchi was now
planting and feeding a special plant mix.

   "Boy, Washu sure ruined this year's crops."

   "I know. . . I'm sorry, though. . . Katsohito gave
me the idea, and I just HAD to try it out. Sorry." The
scientist
said as she walked up.

   Tenchi stood and faced her. "But Washu, my WHOLE
YEARS WORK, gone in a day."

   She hung her head. "Sorry. . ."

   Tenchi saw the tear on her cheek. He walked
forward,
and wiped it off with his sweaty hankercheif. "I
didn't
mean to upset you, Washu. I owe you an apology."

   She smiled. "I forgive you, Tenchi!!--- UH OH!!
Ryoko's-
. . . . Just a sec!!"

   She phased out. Tenchi snickered, and ran up to the
shrine.

******

   "I thought it would be a good idea, that's all."

   "But Grandpa,. . . She took the WHOLE YEAR'S
worth!!" Tenchi snapped.

   Katsohito frowned. "Boy. Settle down. Calm your
spirit."

   Tenchi closed his eyes, and took a deep breath.
"O.K. . . Now, what can I do for our food?"

   "I have a carrot patch out back,  for just an
emergency." Actually,  he had forseen that his plan
would include the loss of a lot of carrots. He had
just taken some from the boy, planted them, and
watered them with normal water. But, he took some sap
from Funaho, (who gladly donated it.), and put it in
the water.

   This guarunteed results. "But, don't tell a soul."

   Tenchi eagerly nodded, and ran outside. Katsohito
focusedhis Jurai energy on one fixed point in the
house below:
Ryo-ohki. <Have you decided?>

   <Patience, Katsohito. Patience. It requires time to
decide; Hasty desicions result in hasty endings.> The
cabbit telepathically answered.

   <Who said that?> The old priest asked.

   <Some guy named, "Mark Fernim".>

   <The rock singer?>

   <Exactly.> The cabbit answered.

   Katsohito became serious after a few minutes of
mirth. <Hurry and decide.>

   Ryo-ohki broke the link.

   Katsohito smiled when he saw Tenchi going down the
steps, with a basket full of juicy, bright orange
carrots.

******

   "And how did you know it was Hatsuma?" Asked Ryoki.

   "He's used that form before. About seven-hundred-"

   "Yes, well, I'm sure it's exciting. Sorry, but I
mut tell you this. Ayeka and Sasami will need to leave
in a couple days." Said the excited. . .human/cabbit.

   "Yes. . . But why?"

   "The Galaxy Police are wanting to check and see if
they are the real princesses. During that time,
Mihoshi
will be gone. And, with Washu in the lab, I could make
my claim!!"

   Katsohito glared. "Why do you want him?"

   She glanced at him. She was taken back at the edge
in his voice. "I, I love him."

   He shook his head. "So?"

   "So, I will do it. With or without your permission.
If the gods want it, they'll let it happen!!" She
stomped out of the shrine, unknowing of Katsohito's
sudden smile.

******

   Ayeka frowned, and moved closer to Tenchi. "Tenchi.
. .I want you to know. . .That I-" Her voice was cut
off as
a loud whistling sound took over. Katsohito calmly
looked up at Mihoshi's ship hurtling toward them.

   "Take cover." He said, as if he didn't care.

   The sleek Galaxy Police Cruiser crashed into the
lake, spraying water all over the place. Mihoshi came
stumbling out soaking wet. "Whooaoaa!!"

   Ayeka and Sasami sighed. "And we're going to travel
in
that. . .that deadly ship." Said the older princess.
She took her  luggage, but Tenchi grabbed both. Those
floating logs carried some other stuff, too. "Asaka!!
Don't drop that!"
   "I'm sorry, princess Ayeka. But Guardians were not
meant to carry luggage." The big red one shot back.

   "Be quiet, Asaka." Then quietly, "Kamidake, when we
take off, put a forcefield around us." Even quieter,
"I don't fully trust Mihoshi's abilities."

   Ayeka turned to look into Tenchi's eyes. "Tenchi. .
. Goodbye. . . I love you, Tenchi."

   Tenchi bowed. "As do I."

   Sasami stepped up, pushed her sister outta the way,
and gave Tenchi a big 'ol bear hug!! "Bye, Tenchi!!"

   "Bye, Sasami,. . . And Mihoshi!!"

   They went inside the ship. After a couple minutes,
it shot up into the air, leaving a slight vapor trail.
Tenchi went back inside.

******

   It had been two days since they left, (Ayeka &
Sasami & Mihoshi), and Tenchi found that it was
peaceful. Ryo-ohki stayed around Tenchi at all times,
"Guarding" him. Ryoko was also nowhere to be found.

   Tenchi decided to go on an excursion, to find her,
in Ryo-ohki. The cabbit gladly consented. So, they
streaked off into space. A few hours later, they came
across a space gas station.

   Tenchi put his sword, Tenchi-ken, into his pocket,
as Ryo-ohki changed into a cabbit again. (She had been
in space-ship form.)

******

   The meat-cutter smiled. "Shoi!! I see'd 'em! Dey
commed
dis way 'bout a coupla daysses 'go."

   Tenchi sighed. "Do you know where they were
headed?"
   "To Alpha Centauri, methinks. . ."

******

   The people there didn't seem to know about Ryoko,
so Tenchi decided to go back home.

******

   "Ryo-ohki? Was that you?" Tenchi was puzzled. He
had heard a sweet feminine voice talking to him. He
was still on Ryo-ohki, and they were nearing Earth.

   Silence.

   "Ryo. . .Ohki?"

   "Meeeeoooooowww!!" Called the cabbit.

   Tenchi frowned. "What was that?. . .That woman's
voice? It sounded so. . . so nice. . . almost like my
mother. . ."

   "Meeeeeoowaaaooww???"

   "Ohhh. . . . Goodnight, Ryo-ohki."

   Tenchi fell asleep quickly.

   "Goodnight, my Tenchi. . ." The cabbit/human
answered quietly.

******

   It was about midnight when they finally got home,
and Tenchi went to bed. Ryo-ohki smiled to herself,
thinking of the present she would give him. . .

******

   Tenchi awoke to find those very large cat-eyes
above him. As he climbed out of unconsciencness, he
gasped.
"Ry. . . Ryoko? Is that  you, Ryo-"

   "Hi, Tenchi!!" She said, in that unforgettable
voice he had heard last night.

   Tenchi gasped. "Your not Ryoko!!"

   She shrugged, and flew down to the floor. He
studied her. She wore a light green kimono, with
ornamental gold streaks on the edges. Her hair was
like Ryoko's, thought of a darker hue.

   She had a beautiful face, like Ryoko and Sasami's
faces combined. (Strange, huh?) Her voice was, as was
mentioned before, sweet and like his mother's. He
gulped. "Who are you, and why are you in my ROOM???"

   "Tenchi. . . I'm Ryoki." She smiled.

   "Ryoki? Sounds like Ryo-ohki. . ."

   "That's what some call me. You may call me Ryoki."

   Tenchi gasped, and pointed at her. "YOU'RE
RYO-OHKI???"

   She nodded.

   "So that's what Washu's potions did. They made you
grow!!" He shook his head. "I'll go see if-"

   She stopped him as he exited the door. "No. I want
to be like this. This way, I. . ." <This way I have a
chance, but I can't tell Tenchi, now!! What do I do?>
Ryoki asked, not realizing that she was using her mind
link with Katsohito.

   <Let him know you love him by simply telling him.
After that, run. He won't notice.> Katsohito answered.

   Ryoki gasped. "Tenchi, I. . . I love you, just as
Ryoko & Ayeka, and the others!!" She ran off.

   Tenchi just stood there. < I never stopped to think
of that. . . I thought of Ryo-ohki as a pet, a funny
little creature. . . I never thought that she might be
as in  love with me as the rest. . . I never thought
of her as someone who wanted me for her own!!> Tenchi
made a pact to treat her equally with the others.
"From today on, Ryo-ohki is as good as the others!! No
longer will I think of her as a pet!! She wants me
just as bad as the others!!"

   Tenchi blushed when he saw Washu at the door with a
wild look on her face. "TENCHI!! RYO-OHKI IS A HUMAN!!
It's the result of WASHUGROW!! She a real human!!"

   Tenchi went downstairs, and saw her once again. The
first thought that entered his head was, "Beautiful. .
."
He shook his head, and sat at the low table, with
everyone else.

   Katsohito appeared. "Well, Ryoki. . .  I see you
are successfully human. . ."

   "Yes. I want to thank you, Washu. For years I've
wanted to feel human pain, eat human food, and talk to
humans like a normal human would. . . Now, my dreams
have come true!"

   Washu was too busy calculating her formula. "OH!! I
see!! That Beta-Carbon Element and the Zweiglum
combined. . . and then that. . . B4Á!! That's it!!"

   Tenchi gulped. "Sasami, this is excellent food."

   "I agree!! It's great!!" All said.

   Tenchi got his stuff, and went to school.

******

   "What are the chances of an animal changing into a
human, with no deformities at all?" Mr. Humanii asked.

   Tenchi stood. "Mr. Humanii, the chances are quite
high."
  "Oh?"

   "If you were to have a. . ." He blushed. " A
cabbit,"

   "A what, Tenchi??"

   "A cabbit. Part rabbit, part cat, and part
spaceship,-"
   "Part spaceship? Mr. Masaki, organic material can't
interact with the inorganic." The teacher stated.

   <If that's what you think, yer very wrong>, Tenchi
thought. "Yes sir." He sat down, blushing and
thoroughly embarassed.

******

   Sakuya came up after class. "Tenchi? Why did you
act like that? A part spaceship?"

   <Why does this little idiot keep following me? It's
almost like she thinks I like her. . .> Tenchi
thought. "Umm,  yeah."

   She laughed. "Wanna sit with me during lunch?"

   He smiled at her, and reached out. "C'mere. I have
something to tell you. . ." Something in his mind
snapped.

   Her eyes lit up hopefully.

   They shone even more when Tenchi took her into the
large janitor's closet. There, he took a rope and tied
her up. She thought they were going to have sex with
her tied up, but she was dead wrong.

   He soaked a cloth in acid, and put it in Sakuya's
mouth. She screamed in agony. She was tied up, and
couldn't do
anything to help herself.

   Tenchi left her there to rot.

******

   Later, Tenchi was at home, in his room, balling his
eyes out because of what he'd done. "I. . .-sob-. .
.Don't care. . . -sob sob-. . .what she's done. .
.-sob-. . .Why . .-sob. . . . did. . . I have . .
.-sob sob-. . . to kill her? . . . -sob sob-. . ."

   He cried out loud. "AAAAUUUUUAAAHGHGHGHHHH!!! WHAT
HAVE I DONE??? I AM A MURDERER!!! TAKE MEEEE
AWAAAAYAYYYYYY!!!! TAKE MY LIFE!!!!"

   Ryoki appeared above him, and floated down to him.
She sat on the egde of his bed, and put her hand on
his shoulder. "Tenchi. . ."

   Tenchi sat up, still sobbing. "Ryoki. . . I, -sob-
I killed Sakuya. . .Why. . .??" He sat by her, and
bowed his head down. He leaned his head onto her
shoulder.

   She embraced him, and he dug his head into her
chest, not even noticing the breasts he felt through
her kimono. Tears stained her dress, and he sobbed on.

   Ryoki sighed, and kissed his forhead.

******

   Tenchi sat at the table, with red eyes. He gulped.
"I. . .I have to tell you something. . ."

   Noboyuki smiled. "You've lost yer virginity?"

   Tenchi glared, and his father backed down. "I've. .
. Grandpa, I need cleansing. . . I've killed Sakuya. .
."

   All gasped. Washu frowned. "That girl that thinks
you like her? TENCHI!!"

   Tenchi sobbed again. "I'm a. . .I'm a murderer. .
."

   Katsohito's eyes widened, and he ran out the door.
Washu, Noboyuki, and Sasami all crowded around Tenchi,
and comforted him. Katsohito came back in with a small
brown bottle. He handed it to Tenchi.
   "Tenchi, take this, and bathe yourself. You will
pray for forgiveness to Funaho with me tonight, at ONE
O'CLOCK, SHARP!!!" He left quickly to prepare.

   Tenchi left, crying.

******

   Tenchi was in the bath, on the tile, looking up at
the glass dome above him. He had a towel round his
waist. He was at the moment regrettably contemplating
suicide.
"I should die. I know, I can confess!! But. . . They
wouldn't find me guilty, because my friends would
vouch for me. . ."
   "I could ask Washu. . . Nah, she'd keep me alive.
Maybe. . . Yeah!! I'll just do it myself!!" Tenchi got
up, and walked to the edge of the water. The football
field-size bath was only about three feet deep. Tenchi
smiled through tears.

   "Goodbye, family. . ."

   He dived  forward, eyes closed. He felt himself
plummeting, falling toward his imminent death. He
waited. .
   And waited. . .
   And waited. . .
   And waited. . .

   And, for some reason, he never hit. He opened his
eyes. He was on his back again, looking up at the dome
again.
He sat up, and wondered how he had gotten there. He
got up, and went to the edge. . .

   "Must you try again, Tenchi?" Came a voice.

   "I must. I've killed a human. I must." He leaned
forward. . .

   "Tenchi . . .I CARE about you. . ." Came the sweet
voice.

   <Sweet voice. . .> Tenchi thought. "Ryoki?"

   "Yes."

   "Leave me to die in peace."

   "No. I care for you too much. Dive again, and I'll
save you again." A cat-like grin appeared on Ryoki's
face.

   Tenchi stopped. He thought her words over. "You
care for me . . ?"

   "Of course."

   Chapt. 3:  "Marriage??"

   Tenchi left the bath, feeling happier than ever. He
had forgotten about that freak Sakuya, because Ryoki
had shown her love. he was sure that the other girls
would do the same, but. . . To him, it seemed like
they only wanted his body. They were always hanging on
him all the time.
Ryoki, however, stayed away until he started to like
her.
   Tenchi found himself liking her more than the
others.
"Oh, yeah!! Funaho!!"

   He ran to the Juraian Royal Tree.

******

   Katsohito frowned, and bowed his head. "Funaho. . .
Tenchi Masaki. He has commited a vile deed. . ." The
old priest nudged his grandson.

   "Yes, Funaho. . . I have murdered one of my own
kind. I seek the forgiveness and cleansing of your
mercy. . ."
Tenchi gulped.

   The water where they were kneeling stirred. It
bubbled, and swirled with many colors. It finally came
up into a large wave, and engulfed the young man. When
the water cleared, Tenchi was gone. . .

******

   Tenchi found himself in a strange dimension.
"Katsohito? Funaho?"

   "I am here, Tenchi Masaki." Funaho stepped forward,
into the strange organic lights. She wore a very
decorative Royal Dress. Some parts, such as the green
leaves, were alive.

   "Funaho. . ." Tenchi bowed, then continued. "I need
your cleansing for my spirit. . ."

   She smiled."No, you don't. Sakuya is yet alive. The
janitor found her. But, you must apologize. I am
sending you to her now."

******

   Tenchi found himself in Sakuya's appartment. She
was asleep, and woke up with a start. "Tenchi?" She
blushed. "What. . .Why are you here?"

   "I need to apologize. . . Forgive me?"

   She smiled wickedly. "No. I hate your guts. I was
waiting for you, because I knew you'd come here to. .
.'apologize'
. . . Now, you will watch as I kill myself!!"

   She took a knife, and held it to her throat.
Tenchi's strange hatred for her had come back; He
didn't move to stop her. She slit a thin line over her
throat, then frowned. "I thought you'd stop me!! Don't
you care?"

   Tenchi shrugged. "No. Not really."

   Sakuya, in her amazement at betrayel, fell off her
bed. Which, with a knife to her throat, killed her.
Her neck was just a bloody mass of ribbons. "See ya,
SAKUYA!!!"

   Tenchi laughed at his luck as he walked home.

   Now, he wouldn't need forgiveness!!

******

   Funaho smiled. Sakuya had died anyway. Funaho
laughed aloud. Sometimes, things went your way after
 all. . .

******

   Tenchi came home with a happy heart, even though it
was about 2:00. . . . P.M.!! Sakuya, that little
freaky bitch. . . WAS FINALLY DEAD!!! In fact, he
yelled aloud.
"SAKUYA IS DEAD!!!!"

   Washu came out of her lab. "Sakuya? I thought she
already was. . ."

   "Nope. She survived. When I told her I didn't care
about her, she fell off the bed, and stabbed
herself!!" He said
in ecstasy.

   "Really?" Asked Noboyuki as he came up.

   "Yup!" Tenchi's face beamed.

   The man looked thoughtful for a moment. "Scratch
one off the list. . " He mumbled. He left quickly.

   Ryoki came up. "Sasami says it's time for supper."
   ( Kinda late, huh?)

  Tenchi ran into the kitchen, and hugged Sasami. (Who
had come home.) "Thanks, Sasami!! I LOVE you guys!!!"

******

   Hatsuma laughed. "Going back?"

   "Yes, Hatsuma. You aren't the man I love!!" Ryoko
yelled.

   "Ha!! What is there to go back to? Your 'lover'
hates you now. Your friends despise you for betraying
them. Look."

   Hatsuma pressed a button, turning on a screen
nearby. It showed Tenchi hugging Sasami. "I LOVE
YOU!!" He cried. Hatsuma laughed. "See? He loves her."

   Ryoko rolled her eyes. "Well of course he loves
her!! She's like a sister to him!! He doesn't mean
that THAT way!!"

   The other pirate smiled. "How about this?" This
time, the screen showed Tenchi in the bath, wearing a
small towel. A strange woman came in, and caught him
as he dove into the hot water.

   She playfully put him back down. Their mouths were
moving, but Ryoko wasn't sure she wanted to hear what
they were saying. Ryoko turned, angry. "He does't even
notice that I'm gone, does he?? What nerve!! But I
can't give up!!"

   "He loves them, Ryoko."

   "No. He doesn't."

   "Fine. Leave. I don't care!! But don't blame me, if
you get there and find out he has another woman!! It's
been amost a week, you know. . ."

   "Tenchi would not leave me after 1 week." Ryoko
said, with a determined edge to her voice.

   "Yes, but if someone such as. . . Ayeka? Wouldn't
she have taken advantage? Wouldn't it be sooooo hard
to face the fact that perhaps he loves Ayeka more?"

   Ryoko sighed. "Yes. . . Allright, Hatsuma I'm
staying. See ya on the bridge!!" She ran off, trying
to keep her chin up. But Hatsuma saw the tears.

   A calm, evil Hatsuma smiled. Plan 1 complete.

******

   Tenchi went to bed with a happy heart.

******

   About 3:00 a.m., Tenchi woke up and couldn't get
back to sleep, so he went to take a scalding hot bath.
He entered the bath, with a small barrel of various
soaps, towels, and a bit of sakki to celebrate
Sakuya's death.

   "Yes. . . Sakuya. . . finally off my back. . ." Me
mumbled as his head sunk under the water. It burned
every inch of his body. It was as if his nerves had
suddenly caught fire. "YYYYYEEEEEOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!" He
screamed, but the only evidence, thanks the water, was
a stream of bubbles.   He popped back up out of the
hot stinging water, with very flushed skin. He looked
like a human beet.

   He opened his eyes, and gasped, as blood ran from
his nose.

   Ryoki sat there at the edge of the bath, nude. She
had been about to jump in, when she saw him, and
froze. He stared at her a little, then gulped, and
sank back down, bubbles evidencing his heavy
breathing.<I JUST SAW RYOKI NAKED!!! What should I do?
Ohhhh. . . . Great!!> he
thought.

   He felt a hand touch his shoulder, and Ryoki was
answered by a torrent of bubbles. She went under
water, and put her arms around his chest, pressing her
breasts into his back.

   <What is she doing???>

   He felt a tongue reach out, and lick his shoulder
blade.
He moaned, and gulped in a big gulp of water. Then, he
had to jump back up, and cough his guts out, to rid
his lungs of the unwanted invader: water.

   He was greeted by the nude and beautiful Ryoki. She
smiled, and leaped forward. He stumbled backward.
"Ryoki. . . What are you doi-"

   He was cut off as he was shoved under water. He
came back up, but she was waiting, and shoved him
under again.

   And again.
   And again.
   And again.
   And again.

   Tenchi finally had all he could take. This time,
when he jumped up, he saw her hands reach out for his
head. He grabbed them, twisted his torso, and threw
her in.

   She came back up, and there was a catlike glow in
her
eyes. She growled. "Soooo. . . Ya wanna play??" She
smiled, and started toward him, walking. Her boobs
were swaying as she walked. Tenchi gulped, and felt a
pressure at his crotch.

   <Oh, no. . .>

   She suddenly jumped forward; He had no time to
react.
She grabbed him, and pressed her body against his as
they wrestled under water. For a moment, a grin
appeared on Tenchi's face, then left as quickly as it
came.

   As they both popped back up, they stood, facing
each other. Tenchi tried to keep his eyes on her face.
But, they kept wandering down to her 'parts'. He
gulped. "Please, Ryo-ohki-"

   She shrugged. "I'm not Ryo-ohki. Anymore. . . I'm
Ryoki.
As human as you."

   "But it's different. . ." Tenchi fought back.

   "How?"

   "It-. . . It's beastiality!!"

   She looked hurt. Her face changed, and somehow, her
features darkened. She frowned. "I am human."

   Tenchi closed his eyes, and sank under water. He
yelled at himself for his stupidity. Here he was, in a
private bath, alone, with a naked, hot cabbi- . . .
HUMAN. . . <I AM SOOO STUPID!!! I'M AN IDIOT!!!"

   He popped back up, to apologize, but when he
looked, she was gone.

******

   Tenchi drank the sakki, savoring the flavor.
Normally, he didn't drink the stuff, but, he was
depressed now. Sakuya was finally totally erased from
his memory. He was only sad about Ryoki.

   He picked up the soapy towel, and threw it at a
vase. It smacked into the ceramic vase, shattering it,
and spraying soap suds. A few suds fell in Tenchi's
drink, but he didn't notice. "I'm STUPID!! STUPID!!!
STUPID. . ."

   He climbed out of the water, grabbed his stuff, and
left.
******

   Noboyuki whistled. "Boy, Tenchi. . . whatever you
did, she's awefully mad!!"

   Tenchi frowned. His dad? Out in the hall at 6:00?
Naaahhhh. . . And, how did he know about Ryoki?. . .
He continued on down the hall.

   He felt a man's hand on his shoulder. His father
spun him around. The man had a camcorder, and was in
pajamas. "What did you do?"

   Tenchi grabbed the camcorder, and yanked the small
tape out. "More hentai tapes? Dad!! I thought you'd
quit!!!"

   Noboyuki shrugged. "Ryoki was sooo upset, she
didn't even wear clothes into the hall!! What did ya
do?. . . Did ya try to . . .get some?"

   Tenchi threw the tape onto the floor, and stomped
on it. He then stuffed the broken thing into his
pocket, to be incinerated later. "First of all, OLD
MAN, My sex life is no concern of yours whatsoever!!
Second of all, I'm
 seventeen, and you don't even know me?? I would
never, ever do such a thing!!"

   The OLD MAN shrugged. "I need the touch of a lady."

   "Ya'd think it'd be a SINCERE lady, not some little
bitch like Sakuya. . ." Tenchi said as he left is
pitiful hentai father behind.

******

   It was now 8:00, and time for breakfast. Sasami
banged on her pot, and yelled, "Come and get it!!
Breakfast!!" ( She had come home.)

   Tenchi came in and sat down with a 'humph'. Sasami
looked at him with worry. "Are you O.K., Tenchi?"

   "I'm fine." He mumbled as he nibbled the eggs. He
ate a bit, got up, and went to his room. He didn't
even comment on the food. Sasami then knew something
was horribly wrong. She came and sat by Washu.

   "What's wrong with Tenchi, Washu?"

   Washu stared at a computer manual. She looked like
she was scrutinizing it, testing her knowledge against
its. "Ha!! I knew it!! Ch$ = %6^7!! Not 'ch$ =
**go9p!!"
She looked happy. Sasami repeated her question.

   Washu looked up. "Huh? Tenchi? Ummm. . . I dunno."
She went back to her book. Sasami took their thanks
for the meal, cleaned the dishes, and started on a
dish she was sure Tenchi would love. It was secret, a
special herb recipe to dissolve any problems. She
snickered all the while.

   Tenchi called his principal, and told the man he
was sick, and wouldn't be coming to school. Then, he
went to bed.

******

   Tenchi woke up, and, looking at his clock, found
that it
was 12:00 p.m. He sighed. Then, the young man got up,
put his jacket on, and went outside for a walk.

   He walked down rows of trees, plants, and paths,
following them. Occasionally, he called a certain
name:
"Ryooookiiiiii???"

   He continued on, on and on.

   Finally, when he gave up and was walking home, he
heard a sniffle to his right. He stopped, and heard
it. He peeked through the clearing, at the crying form
of Ryoki.
   He slowly walked forward, and put his hand on her
shoulder.   "Ryoki?"

   She turned quickly, and pulled her shoulder away.
"Get away from me."

   "No. I can't." Tenchi moved forward, and sat down
by her. She hugged her knees. He leaned back on his
elbows. "Ryoki, I. . . I'm sorry. What I said earlier
was dumb. . ."

   She turned her head.

   He gulped. "I didn't really mean it. It's just
that, it's now a reflex to push women away when they.
. . When thy try for me. . . I feel like some sort of
simple prize that everyone's just dying for." He
picked up a rock, and threw it across the clearing.

   "I feel like an object."

   "And I feel like a worthless pet." She said. Tenchi
heard the sadness in her voice. "For years now, I've
been treated as a cute little fuzzy thing. . . Tenchi?
I love you. . ."

   "I. . . I love you too, Ryoki. And. . . I think . .
.-gulp- that I love you very much." He said, tripping
over the words.

   She turned over, and fell upon his chest. She lay
her head down, and sighed. "Tenchi . . . You're my
only one love. . ."

   He smiled, and lifted her up, setting her on her
feet.
"Wanna walk home with me?"

   "Sure."

******

   Sakuya woke up, in the hospital, a thick bandage
around her neck. She heard a distant voice. "You
killed yourself, Sakuya!! I didn't make you to commit
suicide!! Your mission was to earn his favor!!"

   Sakuya frowned, which was difficult with her neck
muscles sliced to ribbons. Her voicebox was ruined as
well, but she felt it getting better, healing. . .
"Yugi?"

   "Yes. Now, Sakuya. You are my shadow. YOU MUST OBEY
ME!!! GO DO WHAT I TOLD YOU!!"

   Sakuya obeyed, running out of her room, much to her
doctor's dismay

******

   Tenchi entered her room, and gulped. This was the
big night. When he would ask her the question. He had
finally decided who he would marry. Ryoki was in her
bed, asleep.
   Tenchi feared he would wake her, but went forward.
He reached her bed, and yanked back the covers. Ryoki
lay cuddled up  in her kimono.

   Evidently, she had forgotten to change into a
nightie.
Like Tenchi cared.

   He moved forward, and put his hand on her cheek.
Leaning in quietly, he kissed  her mouth softly. He
felt a warm trickle of blood from his nose. He wiped
it off, and kissed her again.

   This time, Ryoki stirred. "Whaa-?"

   Tenchi kissed her again, cutting her off. Her eyes
were wide with surprise. She got up out of bed, and
stood before him. "Tenchi?"

   He kneeled down on one knee. Her eyes widened
considerably. He took her hand, kissed it, and gulped.
<Here goes. . .>

   "Ryoki. . .Will you marry me?"

   She gasped in surprise, and almost screamed, but
she somehow kept it in.  "Tenchi. . . I. . . I . . .
YES!!"

   She fell forward into his arms, and cried. He
combed her hair with his hands, and kissed her. He
felt her tears on his face, as they kissed. They
seemed to melt into one being. . .

   She raised her head, and moaned. "Tenchi. . ."

   He pulled a small red velvet box from his back, and
opened it. She gasped. Her amber eyes lit up fully,
and she squeeled in delight.

   It was a wedding ring. It fit perfectly, and shone
with large diamonds. She moved forward, and they
embraced and kissed. Tenchi smiled. "It was meant to
be."

   She smiled back. Her face was lit up. "Yes, it was.
. ."

   They kissed again, and Tenchi held her close. His
hands roamed over her back, and hers over his. They
both lowered to the floor, still in each other's arms.
She moaned. "Ohhh. . .Tenchi. . ."

   Tenchi's heart pounded in his chest. He had finally
made the decision; Ryoki!! He would be sad to lose
Ryoko and the others, but what was meant to be, was
meant to be. He even loved her more.

   He realized that a bond ran deep between himself
and Ryoko. But he felt that she had shattered whatever
was there, by leaving him for some stupid space
pirate.

   He was brought back to the present by the feeling
of Ryoki's nipplesagainst his bare chest. She had
taken  his shirt off, and she was taking her kimono
off. He looked down
at her supple breasts, and gulped.

   A few drops of blood fell on them.

   Ryoki looked at him, smiled, then continued with
their clothes. Tenchi looked around for something to
wipe it of with, then he sighed.

   Leaning forward, he licked her breast softly,
getting the blood up. He then found that she liked
this, because she was moaning. "Oh. . . Teeennchchii.
. . "

   He started to lick them more, and his hands found
their way to her waist. He held her waist while
licking, and, she finished finally, and threw her
clothing away.

   Then, she started on his pants. He gasped, and a
trickle of blood fell again. He wished it would stop.
"Ryoki. . .I love you. . ." He said. Then, her hands
found him, and massaged his erection.

   He sighed, and started to lick her nipples. She
leaned back onto her back, and Tenchi followed her
action, finding himself over her. He went back up and
kissed her, while she finished with his pants.

   He was finally free!!

   She moaned, and took his member to her entrance. He
moved slowly in.

   She smiled at him, and groaned.

   <I thought girls had hymens??> Tenchi thought as he
started to slowly thrust. She moaned and breathed in
every time his member went back in.

   Meanwhile, her hands searched his chest, while he
bowed his head, and kissed the general area of her
torso. "Tenchi. . . FASTER!!. . . HARDER!!!" She
screamed, probably waking up the whole house.

   He obliged, and started to go faster, building his
speed slowly. He grunted, and felt it build. That. . .
That feeling. . . It kept building, and building . . .

   She gasped a lot, indicating that she was almost
about to explode. She then gasped in pain, her virgin
(?) cunt squeezed his cock on every thrust, and he
cried out.

   Finally, all the pressure released. He yelled, and
his seed shot up into Ryoki,making her scream aloud.

   Tenchi kept going, and she finally released. She
arched her back in orgasm, as he did, and cried out
aloud. Her hands gripped his chest, pulling his skin.

   He rolled off of her, gasping for air. She was
also. They waited to catch their breaths before he
talked. "Ryoki. . . I love you more than life. . ."

   "I love you, too, Tenchi."

          THE    END

   Next: Chapt 4: "Cabbit Children."

   Note:  Ryoki doesn't have any hymen. It was ruined
during transformation between cabbit and human. She
also doesn't have any complete mammary glands. Her
breasts are just a lot of fat, and a place to store
genetic codes:
   She could still become a spaceship, when back in
cabbit form. There is a large pocket in her breasts,
that holds
the necessary codes to do this.
   Think of them as. . .small computers. . .

Carrot."
                                          by Stephen
Shipley

   Chapt. 4: "Cabbit Children."

   Tenchi smiled at his soon-to-be wife, Ryoki. She
smiled back. The whole family was at the low table,
for breakfast. . .Excluding Ryoko. She was still
somewhere in space with her dumbo pirate, Hatsuma, but
Tenchi and the others didn't know his name, except as,
"Karsommai Kaliarmnimn Hargubai."

   Noboyuki studied Ryoki's face for a moment. He
looked at Tenchi, then back at Ryoki's face, which
seemed to glow.  He snickered, and studied their faces
again. His eyebrow raised, and he chuckled.

   Tenchi didn't notice, though; he was too busy
stealing glances at his fianc…. Katsohito spoke up.
"Sasami. . . This miso soup is excellent."

   The little child blushed, and smiled. "Thank you,
Katsohito." She hurried off into the kitchen, probably
to get another course. Mihoshi yawned.

   "I'm not very hungry. . . I'm gonna go take a nap."

   She left, and Washu went to her lab, still eating,
for she was making a formula that would make larger
carrots that were permanently big. Ayeka left as well.
Soon, only Tenchi and Noboyuki were left.

   Noboyuki smiled. "Soooo. . . Tenchi? Wanna tell me
something?"

   Tenchi smiled, and sighed. "Not yet."

   His father's eyes widened. "Not yet? Ya mean-" He
snickered, then laughed aloud, and ran upstairs.

   Tenchi chuckled. His dad sure was strange.

******

    Washu gasped. "There it is!! Oh, my-" She screamed
aloud in a mixture of horror, terror, and sorrow. She
had found a steady rythmic beating, with her
ultra-sound system. She had studied it, and found it
to be the same as that of cabbit heart-beats.

   She had isolated it, and found a signature in
Ryoki. of course, that SHOULD be normal, considering
Ryoki's natural heritage. But, Washu had isolated it
even more, using the many secret sound recorders
throughout the Masaki home, and had found the sound
emminating from her STOMACH.

   There were two explanations. Either Ryoki's heart
had drifted down into her stomach, or she was
pregnant. Washu didn't really know much about a hybrid
cabbit/human's anatomy, but she hoped it was only the
heart theory.

   She desperately hoped it was only the heart.

******

   Katsohito turned. "Come in, Tenchi. . . and Ryoki."

   He smiled. Ryoki's eyes were a little glazed, her
face shining. She was on cloud nine.

   "Yes. . .?"

   "Ummm. . . Grandpa? I- ummm. . .I, we. . ." He
gulped, and shook his head. "I'VE ASKED RYOKI TO MARRY
ME!!!!" He yelled, making the old priest jump back in
alarm.

   "You have, now, hmmmm. . . .?" A somewhat knowing
smile appeared.

   "Would you marry us. . .say. . .on Friday?" Friday
was two days away, and Tenchi knew it. He wanted to
get to Jurai quickly, while the planet didn't have a
rightful king yet. The King of Jurai that Tenchi had
seen was now dead, after the attack of KainII.

   The Juraian Prince rubbed his chin thoughtfully.
"Hmmm. . . Friday, eh? Allright. . . How ya gonna tell
the other girls???" He asked mischeviously.

   Tenchi frowned. "With some help from God."

******

   Ryoko pulled the small lever, adding thrust to her
speed. She was running back to Earth. Of course,
Hatsuma was following her. More like chasing, really.

   Ryoko had found out that her, "Karsommai
Kaliarmnimn Hargubai," was an undercover Hatsuma, who
was working for Yugi. His job was to keep her away
from Tenchi, so that Sakuya could take him.

   Ryoko screamed in pain as an explosion rocked her
ship.

******

   Yugi smiled. Her undercover self was working so
far. She glanced over to a cage that held a small
cabbit. "Too bad you aren't Ryoki, huh, RYO-OHKI??"

******

   Washu frowned. That wave wasn't quite
fullycabbit-oriented. She told her computer to search
for a match. In a few minutes, it came up:  The
discontinuation in the wave matched only one known
source. . .

   YUGI!!!

******

   Katsohito smiled at his grandson. ". . .Do you,
Tenchi, take Ryoki to be your lawfully wedded wife
under the knowledge of all here?"

   Tenchi nodded.

   The old man turned. "And do you, Ryoki, take Tenchi
as your lawfully wedded husband in the knowledge of
the stars?"

   She nodded.

   Katsohito nodded; The signal. The couple were now
to light a candle each, take that candle, and together
light  bigger one, officially signifying the joining
of marriage.

   Tenchi lit his, and she lit hers. He moved his
closer. . . And put the tip near to the wick. She did
too, and Tenchi saw a victorious grin on her face.

******

   Running to the shrine, Washu sent a telepathic
message to Katsohito: <KATSOHITO. . .STOP THEM!! RYOKI
IS YUGI!!!>

******

   Just as the flames touched the wick, the larger
candle went flying. The table was knocked over, and
Katsohito stood there, holding his bokken.

   "Grandpa???"

   Katsohito glared at Ryoki. "Ahhh. . . Another of
Yugi's
puppets. . . Ryoki!! Come willingly!!"

   She smirked. "Old fool. You should never have
gotten into this. And, if you harm me, Ryo-ohki will
die."

   Sasami gasped. "Noooo!!"

   Tenchi took out his sword. "What's this about?"

   Eyeing Ryoki, Katsohito said, "Tenchi, Ryoki is a
shadow of Yugi's. . .You remember her?? Good. If you
would have married her, Yugi could control your soul,
and have access to the LightHawk Sword at any time."

   Tenchi activated his sword. "Sooo. . .What I. .
.What we experienced was. . . We didn't really. .
.make love??"

   She snickered. "Weeeellll. . .Let's seeeee. .
.Since I'm a shadow. . ."

   "Anything physical that happens with her is
non-real. Since, she is a prototype shadow." Washu
finished, walking up the steps.

   Ayeka gasped. "YOU MADE LOVE WITH A HOLOGRAM???"

   Katsohito walked toward Ryoki.

   The hologram  smiled, and dissappeared.

******

   "DAMN!!" Yugi cursed. "They found out!!"

   Hatsuma appeared. "Yugi. . . Ryoko made it ahead of
me to Earth!!"

   Yugi cursed again, then yelled. "KILL HIM,
SAKUYA!!!!!"

******

   Tenchi gasped as a hoard of Ryokos appeared before
him.

   "Tenchi, ATTACK THEM!!" Yelled Sasami, who was
cowering back behind her sister and Mihoshi.

   Tenchi blushed. "I- I can't kill Ryoko. . ."

   "It's not Ryoko, Tenchi!! Those are shadows as
well. Do not let her trick us again. Once is enough."
With that, the old man jumped forward, slicing right
and left at the Ryokos.

   Tenchi yelled, as he jumped after, "Just don't tell
Ryoko!!!"

******

   Ryoko came to the Masaki house, to find a gruesome
sight; Many Ryoko shadows floated above the Masaki
shrine. She flew up there top speed, and fired,
killing three of them.

******

   Sakuya came up, and flying through the air, quickly
grabbed at Tenchi as she flew. She caught something as
she flew past, and Tenchi found that he was suddenly
unarmed. Sakuya had Tenchi-ken!!

   The youth growled, and lept forward, smashing into
Sakuya, and grabbed back his power sword. "Sakuya!!
This time, I will finish you."

   She leapt forward, grasping with her looooooong
claws, but Tenchi dodged them, and ignited his sword.
He swung it in two arcs, severing her hologram arms
from her holo-torso. She screamed in agony.

   He took her head in his hands, and brought her
close. "I am not sorry to see you go, Sakuya. Some
people were just never meant to be."

   She pleaded with him, but it fell on deaf ears.

   There was a sickening yet happy crunch of bones
when Tenchi snapped her little neck, killing her. He
then entered the domain of Yugi as he jumped into a
timehole, that was near where Sakuya had dissappeared.

******

   Tenchi threw the lifeless body down. Yugi was
finally dead, and he was glad. He never, ever, should
have spared her the first time. He chuckled, as he
came back into his own world, to find Ryoko there
waiting for him.

   She was a sight to behold: A torn, scratchy
fighting energy suit, a few burns and scratches, and a
deepgash in her cheek. Tenchi embraced her. "Hi,
Ryoko. I'm sooo glad to see you."

   Her eyes flooded with tears. In a sad voice, she
said, "Thank you Tenchi. . . Thank you. . ."

   Katsohito came up. He only had a red mark on his
forhead. "Hi, Tenchi!"

   Tenchi stared at the red mark. It had the outline
of. . .of a bare foot. "Mihoshi tried her Judo," He
explained.

   "On you?"

   "Not intentionaly, no."

   Tenchi laughed as they all went inside. A few days
and quite a few baths later, they were at the supper
table again.

   A full family. Sasami at the head, Ryoko to her
right, Tenchi by Ryoko, Noboyuki to Tenchi's right.
Katsohito was at the other end, followed by Ayeka,
Mihoshi, and Washu, respectively.

   Washu smiled. "Good thing you didn't light that
candle, for reasons other than just symbols, Tenchi!!"

   "Why, Miss Washu??"

   She smiled. "I dessected it, and it had a 25
mega-ton bomb in it." Then, as an after thought, "Oh,
yeah!! Ryoki is permanently gone, thanks to Yugi's
death. But, she left us a small gift. . . That you
helped to make!!"

   "Hold on a minute. . .She was just a hologram."
Tenchi said, turning red.

   "Not really. I found out that she actualy was a
shadow spirit in a geneticaly manufactured human body.
You actualy DID make love to her."

   Tenchi looked sick. The rescued Ryo-ohki said,
"Meeoow. . ."

   Katsohito nodded. "Bring them in."

   "THEM???"

   Ryoko came back in with four grey-black eggs, about
the size of an ostrich egg. "Tenchi, say hello to your
children."

   "Ohhhh, noooo. . ." Tenchi said. He felt very sick.

   He felt a whoooole other journey coming on.



     A journey called PARENTHOOD.

   ( Which would not be easy with five women all in
love
with him!!)

       THE END!!.. . . . . .(?) . .(?). .(?)

   That was the end.

   Oh yeah!! Crrots have almost nothing to do with
this fic, but I needed a catchy title. I know, I know,
. . . The story line is totally messed up, but
ahhhhhhh welllll.

   This fic was made just so Tenchi could have sex
with Ryo-ohki, kill Sakuya, kill Yugi, and Ryoko leave
with Hatsuma. Also, not much is said about Mihoshi or
Noboyuki.

   This is because, Mihoshi is usually off somwhere
sleeping, or watching TV. Noboyuki is always off
somwhere getting hentai tapes, drawings, magazines, or
whatever else he can find to fulfill his desires.

   One more thing, though. I know. . .I know. .
.Tenchi and Ryo-ohki is sorta beastiality. . .But, I
just wanted to get the point across that:
   #1:  Sakuya doesn't deserve to live.
   #2:  Yugi doesn't, either.
   #3:  Ryo-ohki might be in love with Tenchi just as
much as the other girls.

   This story also excludes Japanese marriage rituals
and stuff, because I don't know much about Japanese
rituals and stuff. So, just pretend that Tenchi and
gang are American. (Without all the cussing.)

   There's the story.
   I hope the word wrap won't give you too hard of a
time ( if any ).
