        It was a bright and sunny morning.  The fish were swimming in the lake,
the birds were chirping, small furry animals were running around the trees.

"AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"

        All of which were scared away, by the stone shattering screams of a young
woman in immense pain.

"GET THIS F*&%$%G THING OUT OF ME!!!!!!!"

        In the Masaki home, several people were by the closet door that led to
Washu's lab, where the sounds of pain, and anger were coming from.  Tenchi
covered Sasami's ears.  Sasami covered Ryo-oh-ki's ears.  Mihoshi and
Kiyone stared at the door, terror expressed on their faces.  The three
rulers of Jurai sat on the couch.  Misaki was covering her mouth, Funaho
was covering her ears, and Azusa had his face buried in his hands.  Yosho
continued saying prayers to the spirits.  And Nobuyuki made sure that the
earplugs were secure in Mayuka's ears.

        "GYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!  S#******************T!!!!"
The screams continued.

        And in the lab, Nurse Washu was working on her most important project yet.
        "Good." Said Washu, checking her watch.  "The contractions are about a
minute apart."
        Delivering a baby.
        "NO S#*T!!!" screamed the mother-to-be.  "GET IT OUT OF ME, ALREADY!!!!"
She tugged on the restraints that were on her arms and legs, set there to
keep her from hurting herself.
        Washu adjusted her goggles, and straightened her face mask.  "Would you
like for the 'Father' to be present for this?  After all, it is-"
        "OF COURSE I WANT THAT A$$^^%^@# TO BE HERE, SO I CAN [ Due to the graphic

        "My, such language." Washu muttered, as she began to walk to the door.
"I'll be back in a moment, so try not to hurt yourself.  Okay, Ayeka?"
        The first princess of Jurai let out another scream of pain, that sent all
of the creatures in Washu's lab running away in fear.

        Washu poked her head out the door, and pulled down her face mask.
"Tenchi?"
        "Yes, Miss Washu?" replied Tenchi.
        "Where is she?" Washu asked.
        "In my room pacing back and forth, the last time I saw her." said Tenchi.
        "Go get her.  It's almost time." Said Washu, as she turned back toward her
lab.
        Tenchi looked uncertain.  "Are you sure that's wise, Washu?  The last time
Ayeka saw her, she. . ." Tenchi did not want to verbally repeat what Ayeka
had said, or did.
        "Don't worry.  Everything will be-"
        Washu was cut off as Ayeka's scream erupted from the lab.
"AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!
FU@$$#%^&&**^^%$#@$$^&**&^%@@#$%^&*&^%$#@#%^&***^%###%%$%^^&&%%##@@$#$%^&^$$
^%%%&&*((**&$$!@#$%%$%#$^^$$^&&**((&*&%$#&^$##%^&*#&%&#%%#*(&&^*^^%$&%&^$%^%
#&%*(*(%^%%#  WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!!!!!!!"
        "Just trust me, okay!" Washu blurted out, almost too quickly.  "Don't
worry, Ayeka!!  I'll help, don't worry!!" Said Washu, as she went back into
her lab.  Everybody mentally noted that Washu had to be one of the bravest
people they had ever known.
        "I'll go get her." Tenchi mumbled, as he went back to his room to fetch
the 'Father'-to-be.

        Said parent was now sitting on the floor of Tenchi's room, nervously
eating M&M's.  The pile of multicolored, candy shells beside her proved
this.
        Tenchi quietly opened the door, and spoke to the nervous woman inside.
"Ryoko.  Washu says that she wants you back in the lab now."
        Ryoko looked up from the floor.  Her face was abnormally pale.  "A-are you
sure it's all right?" said Ryoko, sounding uncharacteristically timid.
"After what happened last time I. . ."
        "It's okay now." Said Tenchi.  "Her head stopped spinning an hour ago, and
she hasn't breathed fire for a while." Although he mentally noted that he
did not know if Ayeka's eyes were still glowing, or not.
        Ryoko stood up, and took in a deep breath.  "Okay." she said, mustering up
all of her courage. "Let's go."

        Ryoko and Tenchi entered the lab.  The cyan-hared woman carefully
approached the bed, where Ayeka lay.  The princess was NOT happy to see
her.
        "It is about time that you showed up!!!" Ayeka yelled at Ryoko, before
letting out another scream of pain.  "AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!  THIS IS ALL
YOUR FAULT, RYOKO!!!!!!!"
        Ryoko winced, from the force of Ayeka's scream.  "N-now Ayeka, I'm here to
help you if you need me for anything." Ryoko managed to say.
        "You want to help me?  Fine!  Bring your neck over here so I can break
something!!!" Ayeka remarked, in a too sweet tone.  "This is all your fault
that this happened to me, Miss 'Able to change her gender'!!!
AAAAARRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!  I HATE YOU, RYOKO!!!!!  I CAN'T BELEVE I DIDN'T TRY
TO KILL YOU WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS!!!!!!!"
        "You hate her?  That's not what you were screaming to her, nine months
ago." All other heads turned toward the one who said that.
        "Um. . .  I think I'll go out, and see how everyone else is doing." Said
Tenchi, as he tried to avoid the confused stare of Washu, the shocked stare
of Ryoko, and the death promising stare coming from Ayeka.
        After Tenchi left the lab, Ayeka and Ryoko returned to their. .
conversation.  "I can't believe that you did this to me, Ryoko!!!"
        "Now, Ayeka." Scolded Washu.  "Ryoko didn't know that she would get you
pregnant.  Even I didn't realize she could alter her gender to that level."
        "That is beside the point!!!" Ayeka screamed back.  "She took advantage of
me, while I was drunk!!!"
        Ryoko wanted to comment that they were both stone drunk, and that Ayeka
did not resist the entire ordeal at all, but seeing as how Ayeka was
ripping the double reinforced, titanium restraints from the ground, she
decided not to voice it.
        Then Ayeka began to scream in pain, again.  "GYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!  IT
HURTS!!!!  IT HURTS!!!!"
        "She's going into final contractions!!" Washu yelled over the noise.  "The
baby's coming out!!"
        Washu went to work, and Ryoko rushed over to Ayeka's bedside.  Ayeka
obliged Ryoko's concern by taking Ryoko's hand into her own, and crushing
it with the force of a full garbage truck running over an ant.  The sound
of bones breaking were muffled by Ayeka's screaming.
        "I can see the baby's head!!" said Washu.  "How are things up there,
Ryoko!?!"
        ". . ." Ryoko was in too much pain to comment, as Ayeka folded her hand
over, and crushed it again.
        "Ryoko, is everything all right!?!" asked Washu.
        "Oh, yeAh.  EvEryThINg FinE!!" Was Ryoko's rather strangled, mental reply.
 "HurRy uP WiTh deLIvEry, plEaSe!!"

        Outside the laboratory, everybody else listened closely to the door,
waiting for any sign that it was safe to go in.  Unfortunately, the only
sounds that they could hear were Ayeka's screaming, and the occasional
comment from Washu.  Then, after a tense minute of silence, a new sound
came from the lab.

"WHAAAAA!!!  WHAAAAA!!!"

        "Hey!" exclaimed Sasami.  "That's not Ayeka's voice!"

        "Congratulations." Washu could be heard from behind the door.  "It's a
girl."

 And so.

        After the cutting of the umbilical cord, which Ryoko had to use a pair of
LEFT handed scissors for, the parents and their child quietly contemplated
what had just happened.
        "So, um. . . How are you feeling, Ayeka?" asked Ryoko, trying not to use
her bandaged hand too much.
        "Tired.  Very, tired." Replied Ayeka, gently cradling her newborn daughter
in her arms.
        "You know. . ." Ryoko tried to find the right words to say.  "I never
expected my first child to be born like this."
        "Nor did I." Said Ayeka.  "But, all things considered, I guess it turned
out well."  Ayeka smirked.  "It could have been that idiot, Seriyou for all
it was worth."
        Ryoko thought about that for a moment.  "I don't think I could get him
pregnant, even if I tried."
        Both of them laughed as loudly as they dared, trying not to wake their
daughter.
        Ayeka decided to bring up a serious topic.  "So, what is going to happen
now?"
        "You mean, besides the fact that we're both going to have to marry Tenchi,
now?" They both managed to only snicker.  "I guess we may as well try to
raise her as a family. . .although considering who's in our family, I think
we're going to have our hands full."
        "I agree." Said Ayeka.  "Your mother. . ." Ayeka waited for any denials of
relation to Washu.  There were none.  "Seemed to take it quite well." The
princess scowled.  "Then again, considering what she has done before, I
don't think she finds THIS as being too unusual."  Ayeka then became more
concerned.  "But my father may be another matter entirely.  He was angry
enough when he thought that it was Lord-Tenchi who impregnated me. . ."
        Ryoko nodded in agreement with that.  "He still hasn't said anything about
it being US, yet." Ryoko grimaced.  "But the way he's been glaring at me, I
think he doesn't like it."  Ryoko then looked deeply into Ayeka's eyes.
"But what he thinks will not change how I feel about this."
        "And. . .how do you feel, about this?" Ayeka asked.
        Ryoko smiled.  "I don't mind one bit.  I think that as far as mothers go,
our daughter is lucky to have you."
        Ayeka smiled, and blushed slightly.  Her expression then turned a little
sad.  "Ryoko. . .about what I said to you earlier. . .while I was in labor.
 ."
        Ryoko put her index finger up to Ayeka's lips.  "I know you didn't mean
what you said.  I understand that it was the pain talking." She then held
up her cast.  "But it wasn't necessary to SHARE that pain with me, Ayeka."
        Ayeka tried her best not to laugh, but her chuckling woke up the sleeping
girl in her arms.  The newborn looked up into the faces of her parents,
with wonder and innocence showing brightly in her eyes.  The shape
inherited from Ryoko's cat like eyes, and the color from Ayeka's ruby
colored eyes.  She did the only thing she could really think of doing.
        Both parents were slightly surprised when their daughter started laughing
along with them, in a laugh that sounded startlingly like Ayeka's usual
cackle.  But they both smiled, and enjoyed the time with their daughter.

        Ayeka and her daughter fell asleep together on the bed, and Ryoko watched
protectively over them.  Ready for the challenges that tomorrow would
bring.  And for one brief moment, all was right with the world.

THE END, FOR NOW.

AUTHOR'S NOTES:

        No flames, please.  I tried to get a tender, heartfelt scene in the end,
so it wasn't all bad.

        Okay, now for the crazy rant. . .

        BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!  I DID IT AGAIN!!!  It's been thought of,
suggested, mentioned, and threatened, BUT only from the writer who gave you
such twisted stories as "A Secret Confession." And "A Passion Satisfying,
Ground Shaking, Glass Breaking. . ." are you given a Fan Fic where Ryoko
and Ayeka actually have a child!!!
        What's next for me!?!  I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!  Maybe I'll write a story where
Nagi falls in love with Tenchi!  Maybe I'll write a Fic where Kagato is the
HERO!!  Heck, I'll have Sasami fall in love with him just for fun!  How
about an alternate universe of the first TV series, where Ryoko gets
amnesia from her crash, and becomes this overly sweet, very lovable
girl!?!?!  Or another alternate universe of the OAV series and the comics,
where Ryoko and Minagi are sisters from the start, and Yakage and Washu are
married!?!?  Maybe I'll just continue THIS story from where it left off, or
someone else will!!!!

        If you want to do ANY of these ideas, or if YOU want to do them yourself,
please tell me!!

        Oh, and by the way.  I was thinking that a good name for Ayeka & Ryoko's
daughter would be "Koyasha"( the name literally means "Demon Child")
        Tell me what you think.  Your constructive comments are always
appreciated.
