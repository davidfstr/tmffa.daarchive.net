Tenchi Muyo! and it's charachters are the property
of Pioneer/AIC.  So please don't sue me.  I'm broke
anyways, so the only thing you would ever get from
me is 43 cents, a B/W television, and a 486 computer!
Also, feel free to criticize, MST, and all that other crap!
It's what I wrote this for, so that fellow readers can crumple
it up, flush it down the toilet, go get it at the sewage plant,
set it on fire, piss on the ashes, and bury it upside-down!
Have a nice day!  And remember, the stupidity and OOCness
was purely intentional, I want this fic to stink!  BTW, extreme
violence ahead!  Not for minors or the faint-hearted!

When we last left Tenchi, he had "lured" Washu
back into her lab and Tenchi's all by himself. Little
does Washu know, she is very close to death's
door...

Episode ?: NO NEED TO SAY NO NEED, DAMMIT! (part two and conclusion)
++++++++++++++++++

Tenchi smiled at the weapon he held in his hand, and then started to examine 
it.  He found a small switch on the side of the gun, right above the 
trigger, he pointed the gun away from himself and pressed the switch.  A 
small indicator lit up on the back of the gun; it read "Energy cell 
--->100%".   The 'fishing hook' at the end of the gun's 'barrel' slid out 
slightly and spread out. <This is perfect!>  Tenchi thought as he went back 
to the operating table; he sat down and waited patiently for Washu to come 
back, with his new-found weapon in hand and hiding it behind him.   After a 
few minutes, the door re-appeared and Tenchi held the gun out in front of 
him, ready to fire.  Tenchi stared grimly at the door as it opened revealing 
Washu, wearing the nurse's outfit Tenchi recognized so well.   He didn't 
even give her a chance to speak as he pulled the trigger and saw the Hook 
and it's prongs fly at Washu at an amazing speed.

He could hear the skin breaking as the tiny prongs impaled themselves into 
the little redhead scientist's stomach.  Washu shrieked in pain and dropped 
to her knees;  she tried to reach down to pull the hook out, but it was too 
late.  The little redhead was shaking uncontrollably, as thousands of volts 
of electricity were surging through her body; her clothes caught on fire and 
her flesh fried.   Tenchi looked at the frying Washu and an evil, crazed 
toothy grin formed on Tenchi's face.  Washu's skin was starting to swell and 
bubble up and explode in certain places. Blood was flying everywhere as 
Washu's charred flesh was bubbling up and exploding.  Some blood hit 
Tenchi's face and he licked it up.  Her eyes then swelled up and exploded; 
Tenchi laughed hysterically at this spectacle, then moments later, her head 
exploded spraying blood and brains everywhere.  Moments later, the 'taser' 
went dead and Washu's lifeless corpse stopped shaking as it hit the ground 
with a sickening *thud*.   Tenchi stopped and stared at the body; he 
suddenly felt rage rise up in him and he tore off one of Washu's arms and 
beat the body with it for a few minutes until he cooled off; Tenchi spit on 
Washu's body <Bitch...>.  He whistled merrily while walking out of the lab 
as if nothing had happened.

When Tenchi got out of the lab he stood by the doorway.   He suddenly felt 
disgusted at the things he has done.  He staggers toward the kitchen, with 
the memories of the murders still very fresh in his mind.   When he gets to 
the kitchen, the first thing he sees  is Sasami's dead body lying on the 
floor, with the axe still stuck in her head.   Tenchi drops down to his 
knees and he starts sobbing uncontrollably.   <Oh my god, what have I 
done?!> Thought Tenchi as the tears rolled down his cheeks. <You know what 
you did...> Tsunami thought back to him.  Tenchi shook in terror <You have 
murdered my sister and Sasami.  I'm NOT going to kill you, doing so would 
only be too kind! I have something else in mind!> Tsunami's voice, even 
though not audible, seemed extremely angry.   Tenchi could only close his 
eyes tightly and wait for his sentence. Nothing happened.  He looked 
around...all was silent; he sighed in relief and drew the conclusion that he 
was just hallucinating.  Tenchi sat up against the wall and relaxed, until 
he saw Sasami get up and charge toward him.      Not even thinking about it, 
he ran upstairs and toward the end of the hall where he curled up in a 
corner.  "ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod" Tenchi babbled to himself as he 
shook in terror uncontrollably.  He was then petrified when he saw Washu's 
headless, charred corpse with a missing arm and  Sasami's lifeless little 
body staggering toward him.    Tenchi was now crying freely and pleading to 
them "Please! Go away! *sob* Ahh! *sob* Go away! Don't hurt me!".   By now 
the two corpses were standing over him.  Sasami 'looked' down at Tenchi 
"But, I want to play with you...Tenchi" she said while pulling the axe out 
of her head.  Tenchi suddenly felt limp and he realized that he was now 
paralytic as he slumped up against the wall.  He could now only see the 
things that were going to happen to him; Washu's hand was now clawing at his 
face, and Tenchi started to bleed profusely.    The last thing he saw before 
Washu clawed his eyes out was Sasami raising the axe.    He felt the impact 
as the axe penetrated the base of his skull and the cold enveloped his now 
dying body.  The last thing he heard was Sasami giggling evilly.

*********Everything goes dark...........

Tenchi screams and wakes up in a cold sweat and closes his eyes as he gasps 
for air <It was only a dream... nothing to be scared of.>.   He slowly opens 
his eyes and looks around; everything is silent.  He sees the clock and it's 
reading "3:38 pm". <Huh?> Tenchi looked puzzled.   He then walked over to 
his window and a feeling of dread washes over him.   The Sky was a blood 
red.  He ran to his mirror and froze at what he saw. His head was still 
cracked open from the axe. "How?!" Tenchi hollared, "How?!" <Oh, 
Tenchi...one more thing, you are immortal and damned to walk this realm for 
all eternity!  Oh! It looks like you have guests!> Tsunami thought to him 
and Tenchi turned to face the door.   It opened and Sasami and Washu's 
corpses were walking towards him.   Sasami focused her cold, dead eyes on 
Tenchi and said "We were just looking for Ryo-oh-ki and we think we know 
where she is!" Sasami giggled and Tenchi shrieked in horror as both corpses 
ripped at his stomach.
