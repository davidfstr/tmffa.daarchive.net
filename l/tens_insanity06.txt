Tenchi's Insanity

Chapter 6: Dreams Kill True

At the Masaki home, Tenchi was counting his kills.  He had four girls' 
dead, four girls alive.  He wanted them all dead.  But it was late.  
The girls were all asleep.  Tenchi had to wait until morning.  Or did 
he?  He got an evil idea.  Why not invade their dreams.  It would be 
fun.  Plus the last girl's dream he enters will be the one he kills.

At Washu's lab, Tenchi looked for a dream-entering machine.  He found a 
few things that were useful.  Then he found a gate marked, "Dream 
Gate."
"Bingo." Tenchi said.
He started the machine and listened to the humming.  The gate glowed as 
the portal opened.
"First stop," Tenchi said. 
He entered the gate and into a dream.

When he exited the tunnel, he saw he was still in Washu's lab.
"Weird," Tenchi said. "The piece of shit didn't work."
As he was about to leave, a sign appeared before him.
"You are now in Washu's Dream," Tenchi read. "Oh.  Like I said before.  
Weird,"
Tenchi walked around.  He saw that everything in the dream was like in 
the real world.  Tenchi had a bad feeling about this.  As he walked he 
looked for Little Washu.  He walked around the machine for her.  But 
instead for Little Washu, Tenchi found his young looking woman.  She 
had long red hair and a body any man would want.  As Tenchi walked 
closer, the woman turned and stared with her green shaded eyes.
"Excuse me miss," Tenchi said. "I'm looking for a woman named 'Little 
Washu'.  Have you seen her?"
The woman laughed.
"Now, now," she said. "This time call me 'Washu'."
Tenchi was shocked.
"You're Washu?" Tenchi gasped.
Washu nodded.
"How do you like me?" Washu asked. "Am I not a sight to see?"
'You're something,' Tenchi thought.
"You've changed." Tenchi said.
Washu laughed.
"No.  This is my dream body." Washu said.
"Oh.  Well your dream body is very…" Tenchi said.
"Sexy?" Washu said
Tenchi nodded.
"Thank you," Washu said. "Is there a reason you're violated my dream?"
"No reason," Tenchi said. "I just wanted to know what a dream was 
like."
Washu giggled.
"Oh?  Is that all?" Washu said. "Well I'll tell you a few facts."
"I'm listening." Tenchi said.
He sat on the floor as Washu prepared herself.
"Fact #1: In a dream, literally anything is possible." Washu said.
"Go on." Tenchi said.
"Fact #2: The dreamer cannot control the dream fully."
"Oh," Tenchi said. "But?" 
 "But someone that enters the dream can." Washu said.
"Oh." Tenchi said.
"Fact #3: The dreamer will not remember the dream if it is tempered 
with."
Tenchi smiled because of that fact.
"I see." Tenchi said.
"But you wouldn't do something like that." Washu said.
"Wanna bet." Tenchi said in an evil tone. "What if someone is killed in 
a dream?"
"They'll die," Washu said. "But only if the killer wants the victim 
dead."
Tenchi smiled evilly.
"I see," Tenchi said. "Washu, I have one thing to say to you."
"What is it?" Washu asked.
Tenchi grinned evilly.  He formed a sword in his hands.  The machinery 
warped away and formed an empty pit.
"What are doing?" Washu asked.
"I'm going to practice my killing skills," Tenchi said. "The first is 
you."
Washu giggled a little.
"You're joking." Washu said.
Tenchi lifted the sword and struck with four slashes faster then the 
eye could see.  Washu smiled.  But in a second she lost her feeling in 
her arms and legs.  Blood sprayed out as her limbs fell off.  Washu was 
horror struck.  She was on the floor like a landed fish.
"Tenchi, what are you doing?" Washu cried out.
Her tears ran down her face.  Tenchi laughed with pride.  He flipped 
her over and blasted her clothes off.
"God you sexy." Tenchi said picking her up.
"Please, put me down." Washu cried.
Tenchi laughed madly and evilly.  He moved Washu upside down and in a 
very tight bear hug.
"Don't worry," Tenchi said. "I don't want to kill you,"
Washu was a little relieved.
"Yet." Tenchi finished.
With that he jumped and tombstone pile drove her in on the ground.  
Washu's head was smashed as brains, blood, bone, and other stuff flew 
with a spat.
"One down," Tenchi said. "Three to go."
He exited from the first dream because it ended.

In the next dream was a palace.  It was big and beautiful.  Tenchi was 
in the outer courtyard.
"I thought I killed Ayeka." Tenchi said.
The sign appeared.
"You are now is Ryoko's dream." Tenchi read.
Tenchi slapped himself.
"I've should have known." Tenchi said.
He walked to into the palace.

Inside was more beautiful then the outside.  Candles lighted the walls 
making them glow golden.  Tenchi walked down the long hallway.  At the 
end was a pair of doors.  The doors look like they were made of gold 
and ivory.  Tenchi pushed them opened to enter the main courtroom.  
Inside, Tenchi saw what he had predicted.  He saw Ryoko on a throne.  
To her side was a naked Ayeka.  The only thing she was wearing was 
chains and a spike collar.  To her other side was Sasami.  Obviously 
she was the chef.  Washu was the weapon maker.  Sakuya was the jester.  
Kiyone and Mihoshi were the guards.  Ryo-Ohki was the pet on Ryoko's 
lap.
"Lord Tenchi," Ryoko said. "I see you returned."
"Happy day," Sakuya said. "The king is back.  Hurra, hurray."
'King?' Tenchi thought.
"Spire.  You're back." Mihoshi said.
"That's Sire not Spire.  Shit for brains." Kiyone said.
"Well excess me." Mihoshi said.
Tenchi was confused.  He tried to speak.  But nothing happened.
"Master," Ayeka said. "How goes the war?"
"War?" Tenchi said.
"Silence slave." Ryoko said backhanding Ayeka.
Ayeka took the hit.
"Yes mistress." Ayeka graveled.
Tenchi walked to Ryoko.
"What's going on?"  Tenchi said.
Ryoko got up as Ryo-Ohki fell to the floor.  Ryo-Ohki ran to Tenchi and 
purred at his feet.  Of course she sniffed them and fainted.  Ryoko 
walked a little with a chain trailing behind her.  A few feet away the 
chain revealed what it was attached to.  Namely Ayeka's collar.
"Come you slave bitch." Ryoko commanded.
"Yes mistress." Ayeka said in fear.
On all fours she crawled.  She was fast and seemed to have done this a 
lot.
"What are doing?" Tenchi asked.
"Just taking my pet for a walk," Ryoko said. "Isn't that right, slut?"
"Yes mistress." Ayeka said.
Tenchi smiled.  He had little to no idea what was going on.  But he 
liked it.  He liked it a lot.
"I see you've made a good slave of Ayeka," Tenchi said. "Dare I say, 
'The Whore'?"
Ayeka looked away with tears in her eyes.
"Tenchi…" Ayeka said.
"Silence bitch." Ryoko said.
She yanked the chain.  The pulled gagged Ayeka.
"Jurains," Ryoko said with a laugh. "Nothing but mindless assholes."
Ayeka was hurt deeply.  And so was Sasami.  Sasami hid her fear and 
sadness well.  But not well enough for Tenchi.
"Before I forget," Tenchi said. "What war are we in?"
"The war against Jurai and the Galaxy Police," Ryoko said. "Mihoshi and 
Kiyone are traitors, Sasami is one too.  Sakuya is my jester as you 
plainly remember.  And Washu is the one that will destroy the Planet 
Jurai."
Ayeka was crying hard.
"And I Ayeka?" Tenchi said. "What is she?"
"The ex Princess of a present from her sister," Ryoko said. "Sasami 
betrayed her for power.  But I didn't trust her.  So I made her my 
chef."
Tenchi loved every moment.
"This is too perfect," Tenchi said. "But I think Sasami should come and 
talk to me.  Face to face."
Sasami was scared.  Tenchi faced Sasami and signaled her to come.  
Sasami was scared.  But her Lord told her to do something.  She would 
be crazy to disobey.  She walked slowly to Tenchi.  Tenchi sensed the 
fear from her.  Tenchi liked it.  After a minute Sasami reached Tenchi.
"You're a traitor." Tenchi said.
"Yes sir." Sasami said.
Tenchi slapped her hard forcing her to the ground.
"That's yes master." Tenchi said.
"Yes master." Sasami said getting up.
"Sasami…" Ayeka said weakly.
"I said silences." Ryoko said.
This time she kicked Ayeka in the stomach.  Ayeka coughed up some 
blood.
"You're mean," Tenchi said. "I like that."
Ayeka was drooling blood.
"Sasami," Tenchi said.
"Yes master?" Sasami said.
"Go and wiped the blood from your sister's mouth." Tenchi ordered.
Sasami looked at Ayeka.  Ayeka glared back.
"But master," Sasami said. "Ayeka will bite me."
"I don't give a fuck," Tenchi said. "Now do it."
Sasami swallowed.  Slowly she made her way to Ayeka's mouth.  Ayeka 
growled softly.  Sasami took out a napkin and slowly moved it to 
Ayeka's mouth.  Ayeka looked away.  Sasami moved in closer.  She moved 
in front of Ayeka's mouth.  She gently wiped the blood from Ayeka's 
lips.  Sasami thought she was safe.  But Ayeka proved her wrong by 
splitting at her.  Sasami reacted.  She got blood on her face from her 
sister.  She moved back in discus.
"She didn't bite," Tenchi reminded. "She spat."
"She's a slut." Sasami said.
Tenchi laughed.
"Then kick her." Tenchi said.
Sasami was surprised.  And at the same time pleased.  She looked at 
Ayeka and gave her a swift kick to the head.  Ayeka was knocked over.
"This is cool," Tenchi said. "I've got one thing to say and see."
"And that is?" Ryoko said.
Tenchi had the evil smile again.
"I want to see Sasami ride Ayeka like a horse." Tenchi said.
"Sounds fun." Sasami said.
"And I her to use Ayeka's hair to force her to go faster and slower." 
Tenchi continued.
"Oh?" Mihoshi said.
"I'll be cool to see." Tenchi said.
That came as no surprise.  Sasami was fast to jump on Ayeka.  She 
slapped Ayeka's ass and made gashes with her nails.
"Be careful," Tenchi said. "You by have to good easy on her.  She is as 
old as they come."
Everyone was happy with the exception of Ayeka.  Sasami grabbed Ayeka's 
long purple hair and yanked.  Ayeka reared back and landed on her 
hands.  Sasami was getting use to Ayeka.  Sasami kicked Ayeka in the 
ribs three times.  Ayeka gasped in pain.
"Harder," Ryoko said. "Do it harder."
Sasami did so.  She kicked so hard, that it broke most of Ayeka's ribs.  
Sasami saw the horror stuck Ayeka and pulled on her hair to tell her to 
go.  Ayeka crawled with shortness of breath.  She crawled and crawled 
as Sasami pulled o her hair. 
"Know this is entertaining," Tenchi said. "But I have a mission."
"What mission is that Tenchi?" Ryoko asked.
Tenchi ordered Sasami back.  She rode Ayeka to Tenchi and got off.  
First, Tenchi grabbed Ayeka by the neck and said, "You're hell is 
over."
With a swift twist, he broke Ayeka's neck.  She fell as Ryoko waved her 
finger.
"Tenchi," she said. "Please be more careful with our slaves."
Tenchi laughed maniacally.  She formed a storm cloud that forced 
stripped the girls.
"Spire, what was that for?" Mihoshi asked.
"That's sire." Kiyone said.
"I just wanted to see you in the nude," Tenchi started. "Come here 
Sasami."
Sasami come to him.  Tenchi formed a scythe in his hands.
"What is it master?" Sasami asked.
"YOU'RE FIRED!" Tenchi yelled.
He raised the scythe and sliced her in two.
"What was that for?" Washu asked.
Tenchi formed ninja stars and threw them at Washu.  They sliced threw 
her.  She fell from the holes in her body.  Mihoshi and Kiyone were 
confused.  Tenchi warped the scene by making the floor crush he in 
spikes.  Kiyone was crushed my a fallen chandelier.  Sakuya wanted to 
run but was hit with an arrow threw her heart by Tenchi.
"The fuck are you doing?" Ryoko demanded.
Tenchi walked to her stepping and killing Ryo-Ohki.  Ryoko tried to fly 
away but the chair stopped her.  It quickly changed into an electric 
chair.
"Don't worry," Tenchi said. "I don't want to kill you… yet."
He formed a button and turned on the chair.  Ryoko was fried in a 
minute.  Tenchi left with this thought, "Two down, two to go."

In the next dream, he was in Galaxy Police HQ.  He was confused again.  
This was weirder then before.  He was in GPHQ but where and in who's 
dream?  The sign appeared.
"You are now in Kiyone's dream," Tenchi read. "It figures."
Tenchi walked down a hall.  In the middle on the right was a door.  The 
door said, "Galaxy Police Commissioner Kiyone Makibi," Tenchi read. 
"Again.  Figures."
Tenchi nodded lightly.
"Who the hell is it?" Kiyone said. "I'm very busy."
"It's me Tenchi."
"I don't give a rat's ass," Kiyone said. "I am very busy."
"Even for a congregative talk?" Tenchi said.
The doors opened instantly.
"Welcome Tenchi," Kiyone said. "You're here to honor me?"
Tenchi nodded as he entered.  The doors slammed shut behind Tenchi.
"Cool promotion." Tenchi said.
"Many years ago." Kiyone said.
Tenchi rolled his eyes.
"I see," Tenchi said. "Listen I don't have that long to spend.  I know 
you're a very busy woman.  So if you tell me the history and were the 
other girls are.   I'll leave in peace."
"My past was made when I single handedly caught the evil space pirate 
Ryoko and destroyed Ryo-Ohki," Kiyone said. "The two Princesses were 
very pleased with me."
"Ayeka and Sasami?" Tenchi asked.
"No.   My right and left tit," Kiyone said sarcastically. "Of course 
Ayeka and Sasami."
"What about Washu, Sakuya, and Mihoshi?" Tenchi asked.
"I know not this Sakuya person," Kiyone said. "Washu however is in a 
mental station living out her life sentence.  She has no hope of 
recovery." 
"And Mihoshi?" Tenchi asked.
Kiyone put her finger to her mouth.
"Last I've heard of her," Kiyone started. "She was on Earth.  Dirt 
broke.  No home.  No money.  Begging on the streets.  Stealing beer and 
other stuff.  The poor, poor bitch.  But with her IQ she had it 
coming."
"She has something like that coming." Tenchi mumbled.
"Huh?  What did you say?" Kiyone said.
Tenchi didn't answer.  He just walked up to her and said, "Don't worry.  
I'm not going to kill you… yet."
"What are you talking about?" Kiyone asked.
Tenchi slammed the desk.  Under his hand was a button.  Kiyone didn't 
remember that button.  Tenchi left the room and shut the door.  Kiyone 
got up and walked to the door too.  Behind her the wall started to 
give. With a loud rip, the walk fell off as the entire room was sucked 
into space.  Kiyone tried to hold on to something but she slipped off.  
She was sucked into space and exploded.
"Three down and one do go." Tenchi said leaving the dream.

In the final woman's dream which was Mihoshi's.  Tenchi found himself 
in a bar.
"Figures." Tenchi said.
He saw Mihoshi on a stool drinking her brains out.  This for her is 
about a haft a cup.  But she seemed to drink a whole lot more.  Tenchi 
feared what would happen if he got too close.  He knows not to disturb 
a drunk.  But this was a dream.  He walked up and sat next to Mihoshi.  
Mihoshi was too busy drinking to see him.
"Um, Mihoshi?" Tenchi said.
Mihoshi looked for a second then continued drinking.  Tenchi was a 
little insulted.  But as you could have guessed, Mihoshi reacted a few 
moments later.
"Tenchi I'm so glad to see you," Mihoshi said. "I've been hoping to 
bump into you."
"Oh.  Good," Tenchi said. "But tell me.  What are you doing here?"
"It was a guess," Mihoshi said. "And I figured that a want to drink in 
my dreams.
Tenchi understood.
"I see," Tenchi said. "But aren't you afraid that you're liver will 
give out?"
"My liver is tough," Mihoshi said. "Plus I love to drink."
"Cool," Tenchi thought.
'Cool and perfect.'
"Let's make a deal." Tenchi said.
"I love that show." Mihoshi squalled.
"No Mihoshi," Tenchi said. "A real deal.  I'll see if you can drink a 
hundred bottles and see how tough you liver is.
"Okay," Mihoshi said. "Not including the ones I had."
"Yep," Tenchi said. "Plus I'll pay."
Mihoshi couldn't pass up a offer like that.
"A hundred bottles of your strongest beer." Mihoshi said.
Tenchi fell anime style.
"Wow.  I didn't think you go that far." Tenchi said.
Mihoshi started drinking fast.  Tenchi increased Mihoshi's drinking 
speed.  She drank all one hundred in seconds.  Of course she did feel 
good.  She felt her heart starting to slow down.
"I guess you were right," Mihoshi said. "I couldn't take it."
"I see," Tenchi said. "I only got one thing to say."
"What?" Mihoshi said blacking out.
"I want to kill you and I have." Tenchi said.
Mihoshi blacked out and died.

Tenchi exited from the dream world.  It was late and Tenchi want to 
where Mihoshi was.  He entered the room and saw Mihoshi in bed.  Tenchi 
walked to her.  He uncovered he and placed his fingers onto her neck.  
Mihoshi was dead alright.  Tenchi took out a mini coffin and sucked 
Mihoshi's lifeless body inside.  As he walked but to he's room he sang 
to himself.
"One more dead, her heart boom.  In the house, is an empty room.  
Someone is next; I'll send her to her tomb.  Because she's next girl 
up, and she's heading to her doom."

Tenchi: On the next episode.  The next girl is also close to insanity.   
But I'll see she goes off the deep end.  The next episode: When Insane 
Boy Meets Insane Girl.

This is 6 of 11.  I'm getting closer to the end.  And closer to the 
final kill.  Who will it be?
