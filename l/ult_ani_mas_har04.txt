It's now morning in Racoon City, Leon wakes up with a very nude Ada at his 
side...

Leon: "Hiya babe, how did you sleep?"
Ada: "I feel like I'm 16 again."
Leon: "In a way I'm still 16, cuz I never age due to my Juraian heratige I 
guess."
Ada: "I guess I could say the same, seeing how I never aged in Heaven."
Leon: "How did you get revieved by anychance?"
Ada: "It was so sudden, one minute I was in Heven and now I'm here."
Leon: "Damn this is getting wierd."
Ada: "Oh well, let's get freshened up."
Leon: "Yes dear."

After getting freshened up, they join the others for a big brunch prepared by 
the iron chef that they hired...

Iron Chef Nitaku: "Your brunch is served!"
Leon: "YUMMY!"

Leon starts it off by swolloing a few slices of honey baked ham whole...

Chris: "Christ Leon, Ada must have knocked you up pretty hard last night."
Carlos and Steve: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Claire: "You guys are so insensitive."
Jill:  "Damn straight."
Sherry: "I guess men will always be men..."

In the city of Tokyo...

Tenchi: "God damn my head is aching."
Usagi: "Uh, since when was Trev the size of Godzilla?
Everyone: "Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!"
Mamoru: "He's friggin' huge!"
Ami: "His power has gone up dramatically with the Pychotic Murder Syndrome..."
Shinji: "You almost killed Asuka, you sick bastard!"
Char: "Char to SEELE, it seems Shinji is no longer under our control."
Keel (over the radio): "Then you must kill him as well as Trev and his 
affiliates."
Char: "Very well. Asuka, are you alright?"

No response...

Keel: "Our radars detect Asuka is dead."
Char: "Ayanami, shoot off your N2 Grenade Launcher at Shinji and Trev, we're 
abondoning the operation."
Ayanami Rei: "Aye."

Rei shoots of an N2 grenade, but Trev and Shinji see it coming from a mile and 
evade the blast...

Shinji: "Mother, how could you let yourself be controlled by those monsters!"
Ayanami Rei: "Ikari-kun?"
Shinji: "Mother, together you and I can bring down SEELE!"
Ayanaim Rei: "Shinji-kun, it's really you!"
Shinji: "Ayanami, you've regained your memory at last!"
Char: "Emergancy, all EVAs have regained their memory!"
Keel: "Hurry up and get back to base, we will proceed with the 2nd back up 
plan..."

Char takes off, leaving Ayanami and Shinji alone to deal with the incredible 
power known as the Psychotic Murder Syndrome...

Shinji: "Whoever you are, I am back from the dead and will kick your ass!"
Trev: "Oh really? Allow me to demonstrate my power. I think the genetically 
altered version of your mother will make a fine target."
Shinji: "BASTARD!"
Trev: "Omega Ultima Fla..."

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM, An N2 grenade hits Trev...

Shinji: "Asuka, you're alive!"
Asuka: "You underestimated me you moron."
Shinji: "Oh yeah, sorry about that."
Ayanami Rei: "He's not dead."
Asuka: "No way!"
Trev: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 
ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Now we go to SEELE HQ...

Char: "Keel, what is this back up plan you're working on?"
Keel: "The most advanced piece of technoogy, EVER!"
Char: "Oh?"
Keel: "Allow me to introduce you to the EVA Apsulus!"
Char: "Gunnius' Apsulus mixed with EVA technology?"
Keel: "Correct."
Char: "Is it possible that this monstrosity be piloted by a human?"
Keel: "But you're no ordinary human, right?"
Char: "Ah, so New Types can pilot this eh?"
Keel: "Correct again."

An EVA Apsulus? SEELE's creations just seem to be getting more wicked by the 
minute, and that's by all means a BAD thing. Now we go to Racoon City, where 
Leon has finished 5 full
course meals...

Chris: * Damn, Ada must be a sex machine if she made him eat like this..."
Leon: "That sure was delicious. Thanks Nitaku!"
Nitaku: "You're welcome sir."

Meanwhile in a cave outside Racoon City...

Fuuma: "Lady Haruna, has Demon's Pride been concieved yet?"
Haruna: "Yes, my illusion seduced my prey quite nicely and now the child is 
born, in a matter of minutes will be be a full fledged Super Saiya-jin!"
Fuuma: "Sounds like all is going to plan."
Haruna: "Any word from Tetsuo?"
Fuuma: "No ma'am."
Haruna: "He's probably lost to Trev, but oh well."
"Mama."
Haruna: "Yes my dear baby boy?"
Demon's Pride: "I want to kill somebody!"
Fuuma: "He seems to have developed quite nicely."
Demon's Pride: "Are you my father?"
Fuuma: "No, I'm a loyal sevant of your mother."
Demon's Pride: "Oh, so I'm allowed to kill you!"
Fuuma: "No!"
Demons' Pride: "ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Haruna's blood thirsty son goes SSJ2...

Demon's Pride: "Gamet gun fire!"

SPLAT!

Haruna: "He splattered like a water baloon."
Demon's Pride: "Mother, feed me more victims! FEED 
ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Haruna: "Yes my dear child. I am leaving right now to get you some victims!"

Haruna takes off towards the Racoon City Mansion...

Demon's Pride: "My mother's probably gonna take a while, I might as well observe 
the battle taking place many miles away..."

Demon's Pride takes off for Tokyo, which could be bad news. Speaking of Tokyo, 
that's where we are taking you now...

Usagi: "Ami, is there any way to cure the Psychotic Murder Syndrome?"
Ami: "Not that I know of."
Tenchi: "We've got incoming!"
Mamoru: "Huh?"
Gokou: "Ohayo all."
Tenchi: "For a minute there I thought you were Sakuya and her thugs." 
Piccolo: "Who's Sakuya?"
Tenchi: "You don't wanna know."

Meanwhile at the Black Mesa Facility...

Noah Bright: "Dr Rosenburg, how long is it until the super sniper beam rifle is 
ready?"
Dr. Rosenburg: "Not to long."
Amuro: "What about the armour plating?"
Dr. Rosenburg: "You'll have to talk to Gordon Freeman about that."
Bright: "You must hurry! The whole world is depending on Amuro and the RX79-NT3 
EVA-Gundam!"
Rosenburg: "Fine, we will accelerate our efforts."

Back in Tokyo...

Vegita: "Psychotic Murder syndrome?"
Piccolo: "Sounds bad."
Rei: "VERY bad."
Gokou: "What should we do?"
Usagi: "If only I had a holy relic, I could cure Trev of his syndrome."
Mamoru: "Where could we find a Holy Relic?"
Tenchi: "My Light Hawk Sword should work."
Usagi: "By the power inbedded in me, I hereby cure you of your illnesses. 
Trev... Return to your normal state!"

Trev shrinks down to size and losses his Psychopathic ways...

Shinji: "I guess he gave up."
Trev: "What are the N2 EVAs doing here?"

The entire sudden, all three EVAs get possessed by a powerful force...

Demon's Pride: "EVAs, I command you to destroy that Trev character."

Re-Zombified Shinji, Ayanami, and Asuka: "Yes sir."
Trev: "Shit..."
"Hold it right there!"
Trev: "That's got to be the biggest Gundam I've ever seen."
Amuro: "Allow me to show you the power of the RX79-NT3 EVA-Gundam!"

Amuro takes out his sniper beam rifle and blows the EVA pilots to Hell...

Trev: "Sucks to be them."
"Amuro, it seems we meet again."
Amuro: "What the Hell is that thing?"
Char: "It is none other than the EVA Apsulus!"
Trev: "What the fuck is going on around here?"
Usagi: "Trev, get over here!"
Trev: "Oh, it's you guys."
Makato: "Yeah, it's us."
Vegita: "Well-well, if it isn't the goodie two-shoes."
Trev: "Yeah, that's me."
Usagi: "Good thing that I was able to cure you."
Trev: "What the fuck?"
Ami: "You were ina Psychotic Murder Syndrome."
Minako: "It was some intense stuff too."
Trev: "Oh, I'm really gonna show that bitch Haruna intense when I get revenge 
for Trell and Adrian."

Now we go to a very shaken up Racoon City...

Leon: "Jusus Christ, it's a fucking Earth quake!"
Ada: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Chris: "What the fuck? It's too massive to be any pussy ass Earth quake!"
Claire: "Could this be Umbrella's doing?"
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Carlos: "Like, what 's with the scary laugh."
Steve: "I wanna get out of this cursed town!"
Leon: "Who the Hell are you?"
Haruna: "I am Haruna, the sister of Ultimate Evil."
Leon: "I see... Kamehameha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Haruna deflects the blast like a basketball...

Leon: "Kaioken x20, Masenko ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Haruna: "Senshi Kamehamhea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Leon gets blown back a good 100 feet, and is out cold...

Ada: "Leon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"You there, what is the meaning of this?"
Haruna: "Who the Hell are you?
"I'm going to kill you."
Haruna: "Well well, you are quite powerful, but not powerful enough."
"Horseshit! I am Kamui, the last of the Seven Seal!"
Haruna: "Oh really?"
