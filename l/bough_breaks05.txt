********::taps microphone::  Hi there.  Everybody still here?  Good, I was 
thinking a good portion of you might have bailed on me after Chapter 4.  To 
those who did, I say...well, this IS a lemon, isn't it?  What did you expect, 
puppies and apple pie?  Anyway, I want to apologize for Chapter 4.  I might as 
well just do it this way, because I know how bad that part with Ryoko and 
Mihoshi was.  But this IS better.  How?  Let's just say that this one will have 
some actual plot, as opposed to just Ryoko and Mihoshi going at it (which was 
more a personal fantasy of mine anyway, but I digress.)  ^_^  So buckle up and 
keep your hands inside the spaceship at all times.  Oh yeah, and Tenchi Muyo 
blah blah copyright those odd fleshy things in suits at those big international 
corporations named AIC and Pioneer that probably won't ever read this and don't 
care anyway.  End of disclaimer.  Nyeh.*********

	"Last night, I had a dream about you
	In this dream, I'm dancing right beside you
	And it looked like everyone was having fun
	The kind of feeling, I waited so long
	Don't stop, come a little closer
	As we jam, the rhythm gets stronger
	There's nothing wrong, with just a little little fun
	We were dancing all night long
	The time is right to put my arms around you
	You're feeling right, you wrap your arms around too
	But suddenly, I feel the shining sun
	Before I knew it, this dream was all gone."

	"Now then, let's continue," the gray-haired professor emeritus said as he 
clicked on the projector at the front of the room.  Shaky black and white 
footage of World War II began to roll, while he continued to speak, narrating 
the filmstrip, something called "Movietone News."

	"In 1945, towards the end of World War II, the United States dropped the 
first of two atomic bombs onto our island.  The first one, nicknamed 'Little 
Boy' was dropped onto the city of Hiroshima, nearby our Okayama prefecture.  The 
devastation it caused was only matched by the second bomb, named 'Fat Man,' 
dropped onto another of our neighbors, Nagasaki.  These two bombs each had the 
combined power of over 15 thousand tons of TNT, and were used as terror weapons 
by the United States to end the war through civilian casualties.  Unfortunate 
though they were, had the war dragged on, many more Japanese citizens were 
likely to have been killed.  Also, in the nearly 50 years since then, these two 
cities have been rebuilt, though a small memorial remains in Hiroshima in the 
form of a park in the center of the city.  Hiroshima today is a bustling 
commercial city that draws many foreign tourists to it..."

	Amagasaki turned around to face Tenchi.  "Hey, Tenchi, what do you think 
of this guy?  I'd say he's pretty boring myself.  What a snoozefest."

	"Come on, man, Kumashiro-sensei is talking about the bombing back in World 
War II.  It's really important for us to know this stuff," Tenchi whispered to 
his friend, one row ahead of him in the lecture hall.

	Amagasaki pulled a confused expression.  "World War II?  What in the world 
is that, Tenchi?"

	"Didn't your parents tell you anything about it?  I think it lasted from 
1941 to 1945, but I'm not really sure.  All I know is that back then, the 
Americans really hated us, so much so that they blew up two of our cities.  
Don't you ever talk about it with your folks?"

	"Nah, my parents are really strict and old-fashioned.  They won't talk 
about the Imperial War with me at home...that's what we call it.  My father just 
refers to it occasionally, and says that it's every citizen's duty to defend 
their homeland until the very last..."

	"AHEM!"  Tenchi and Amagasaki were immediately interrupted by the 
professor at the front of the room.  Both of them looked up at him.  "Masaki, 
Amagasaki!  If you have a discussion that pertains to our topic today, I would 
appreciate it if you would let the whole class in on your insights.  Otherwise, 
please keep quiet!"

	Both Tenchi and Amagasaki stood up and bowed slightly to the professor.  
"Hai, sensei.  We apologize."  They sat down again, and Tenchi grimaced and 
flicked Amagasaki in the head from behind, who grabbed at his head and turned 
around.  "I told you you'd get us in trouble, baka," he whispered harshly.

****************************************************

	So perfect.  It was hard to believe just how perfect, in fact.  Even drawn 
in pencil she looked irresistable.  There were not enough shades of gray to 
convey just how delicate and smooth her face was.  Her cute little button nose, 
those huge blue eyes, pools of radiance that were as blue as the sky after storm 
clouds had moved out.  The way her body curved fluidly through clothes that 
seemed to want to cover something that didn't seem to want covering, the wild 
randomness of her blonde hair, unkempt, unstyled, beautiful soft locks that 
cried out to be stroked and ran through, the tautness of...

	"Hey, Tenchi, I said that *study hall is over!*  C'mon you space cadet, 
it's time for lunch!"  Tenchi jerked as he snapped out of his trance and stared 
up at Nuriko Ada, girlfriend of Amagasaki and lunchroom buddy.  Not quite 
overweight, Nuriko had a pleasing fullness to her that Amagasaki seemed to find 
attractive.  Her moon face was framed by shoulder-length brunette hair, a cut 
that gave her a seriousness of intent that was only matched by her piercing 
green eyes.  A face that had more than a passing resemblence to Ryoko.

	Tenchi hurridly covered the piece of notebook paper that contained the 
pencil sketch he was working on.  Seeing this, Nuriko leaned over to see it 
before he completely covered it.  "Oooh, what are you drawing, Tenchi?  C'mon, 
you can let me see!"  She grabbed for the paper, but Tenchi pulled it away.

	"Uh, no...no, Nuriko.  It's nothing, really nothing!  I'm just 
doodling...heh heh, you know me, always doodling, yeah."  He nervously began 
looking around the small, conference room-sized hall, trying to see if anyone 
else saw it.  Some other students were looking at them, but most were still 
chatting with each other.  Still, it was enough to make Tenchi start feeling 
very, very small.

	"Ooh, I bet it's something really neat!"  Suddenly, Nuriko had an idea.  
"Hey, Tenchi, look!  I think someone took your bookbag!"  Tenchi quickly looked 
down by his desk, but his bag was still there.  With his attention momentarily 
distracted, Nuriko swiped the paper from his hand, uncrinkled it, and held it 
up.  After a moment, she blushed and put it back down on his desk.  "I'm 
sorry...I...didn't know.  Is she a friend of yours?"

	Tenchi dropped his head and stared back down at the nude image of Mihoshi 
he had drawn.  Quite in the style of an anime company he had become fond of, 
Tenchi had meticulously shaded her body, and detailed her hair in a most loving 
way.  He had even spent time on the background, placing her on the shore of the 
lake next to their house, with a hint of trees and a sky.  It was clear that 
Tenchi was an accomplished artist, following in a figurative style the quality 
that his father was known for architechturally.

	"Yes...yes she is," he said as he blushed deeply.

	Nuriko seemed embarrassed herself at having walked all over an obviously 
very personal moment.  At that moment, the bell rang, signaling the start of 
lunch.  The last of the other students in their study hall had finished filing 
out.  "I'm...sorry, Tenchi.  It...it's not my business," she replied very 
quietly.  "I'll see you at lunch," she said hurridly before picking up her own 
bookbag and leaving the room.  Tenchi sat at his desk, perfectly still, for a 
few moments more before finally carefully folding the drawing, putting it into 
his bag, and walking out of the room.

****************************************************************

	Deep into the empty reaches of space, a small Galaxy Police shuttle was 
rocketing towards the Sol system in hyperspace.  It's sole occupant was focused 
entirely on the mission assigned, one which did not bother him in the least.  He 
was almost looking forward to it, for it had been some time since they had met.  
However, the succeeding part of the mission was to prove difficult, but it must 
be accomplished for the greater good.  Even if it meant killing a loved one.

	Seated in the captain's chair, this occupant saw the comm light spring on.  
He reached over and brought up the secured channel after punching in a few 
commands on the console.  The face was very familiar, for this was the one who 
had assigned the mission to him.

	"Report your progress, Agent One," the smooth, yet haughty and chilling 
voice sounded.

	"I have just passed Sirius, upon vector three-five-one.  Proceeding upon 
scheduled route to Colonial Planet 0-315, Earth.  Estimated time of arrival is 
approximately nine hours," the somewhat young yet experienced voice replied 
confidently.

	"Excellent.  Once you arrive, secure the shuttle with the multi-phasic 
camoflague and initiate Objective A.  You do not want to be discovered, so 
disguise yourself appropriately.  If the subject resists, you are ordered to 
terminate immediately.  The mission must come first.  Do you understand, agent?"

	"Yes...yes Sir," the occupant replied somewhat hesitantly.  "But..."

	The other voice interrupted him.  "Do not let your feelings get in the 
way.  I expect you to follow my orders to the letter.  Otherwise...it will be 
*you* who will be facing termination.  Have I made myself clear, Agent One?"

	"Sir."  The agent switched off the comm channel and sighed.  "I am 
sorry...sister."

**********************************************************

	The lunchroom at Tenchi's high school was filled by the time he finished 
his walk across the lawn.  Entirely enclosed in glass, it was partially 
destroyed in the gas explosion some months ago when Tenchi and Ryoko fought.  
However, over the past summer, workmen had repaired the delicate framework, much 
to Noboyuki's delight when he visited the school for open house at the beginning 
of the school year.  Noboyuki had always marvelled at its design (he wished *he* 
had designed it of course), and remarked to Tenchi that he was very lucky to go 
to such a progressive, open air high school.

	"Yo, Nuriko, what's got you so down?  It looks like you just broke up with 
Amagasaki or something," Nuriko's friend Yuri told her as she sat down next to 
her, looking dejected and rather depressed.

	"Nah, that's not it.  I really think I made Tenchi feel pretty bad, 
though."

	Yuri looked surprised.  "What?  Why would you say something like that?"

	Nuriko took a bite of lunch.  "Well, you know how he is with his art?  
Always hiding it and stuff from us when we try to get a peek at it?  Well, I 
think I took it a little too far today.  He was drawing this...girl.  I've never 
seen her before, but she was nude..."

	She looked up, and noticed Tenchi walking through the entranceway across 
the lunch room.  She immediately halted her conversation, and continued eating, 
only looking at her tray.  Tenchi himself was walking with his head down, trying 
to avoid the gaze of his friends a few tables over.  Suddenly, Amagasaki came up 
behind him and slapped him on the back, startling him.

	"Heya, Tenchi!  I was wondering when you were gonna get here!  Come on 
over, I even got a second tray just for you so you don't have to waste time in 
line!" Amagasaki said enthusiastically.

	"Uh...yeah!  Sure...sounds g-great," he said nervously as Amagasaki pulled 
him by the arm over to the table.  Tenchi finally relented and pulled out a 
chair for himself.  He dropped his bookbag and plopped down into the seat.

	Yuri, never being one for tact, was the first to speak.  "So Tenchi, who's 
the girl?"

	Nuriko blushed and elbowed her friend in the side.  "Yuri!" she whispered 
harshly.

	Amagasaki sat down next to Nuriko and put his arm around her.  "Hey hon, 
what's going on with you?  You seem down."  Nuriko simply snuggled up against 
him and rested her head on his shoulder, keeping silent.

	Tenchi had taken that opportunity to shove his bag under the table so that 
no one could grab it and pull out his drawing.  He pretended to ignore Yuri, but 
she would not be deterred.  She frowned and spoke up again.  "Hey, Tenchi, you 
deaf kid?  I asked who the pretty girl in your picture is!  You got a girlfriend 
finally or what?"

	Tenchi let his politeness get the better of him and he finally turned to 
her.  He smiled rather uneasily and said, "N-no.  She's...just some girl.  You 
know, gotta keep practicing and all that, eheh."  He mentally kicked himself.  
Man, that sounded stupid, he thought.  What if they find out about Mihoshi?  
Then I'll have to tell them about Ryoko and everyone else, and they're gonna 
freak out and hate me for being a weirdo!

	But it was too late.  Curiosity had gotten the better of Yuri.  "Oh come 
on, kid, you can tell us.  We're your friends.  She's got to be *someone*.  Tell 
you what, just let me see the picture, and I'll tell you if I recognize her, 
okay?  I promise I won't let anyone else see."

	"Come on, Tenchi, just let her know.  You already told me that she was 
your friend, so why not just tell us who she is?  Please," Nuriko pleaded.

	Tenchi sighed and shook his head.  "All right guys, but you're probably 
not going to believe it when I tell you.  Since it obviously doesn't do any good 
to try to keep things from you," he said.  "Her name is Mihoshi.  She's from 
outer space.  She's a Galaxy Police officer that fell to Earth about a year ago 
when a huge rift opened in subspace.  The rift also sucked up the water monster 
my friend Ryoko created with her demonic powers."  He sighed again, deeper, put 
his hands behind his head, and stared up at the ceiling, recognizing how idiotic 
it all sounded.  Well, how was it supposed to sound?  He had never had to 
explain it before, and hearing it even made HIM want to disbelieve it.  "For the 
past year, her and four other alien women have been living with me in my house.  
I've been trying to keep them a secret from you since then, but apparently 
you're all never going to give up until you find out, so that's the truth.  Oh 
yeah, and I also live with Ryo-ohki, a little cat-like creature that loves 
carrots and can turn into a huge crystal spaceship.  Happy?"

	Hearing no response, Tenchi looked down and saw all three of his friends 
staring at him wide-eyed.  Slowly a smile spread over Yuri's face, and she began 
to giggle.  Soon Amagasaki joined her, but Nuriko kept silent, simply smiling at 
Tenchi.  Their giggles quickly turned to full-blown laughter as they nearly 
keeled over laughing.  

	"Oh MAN, Tenchi, maybe if you had said one or *two* alien women I'd 
believe you, but FIVE?  Oh that's a good one man!" Amagasaki joked, then 
continued laughing his head off.

	Tenchi gritted his teeth and closed his eyes, trying to block it out.  But 
after a minute, he suddenly shot up and slammed his hands down onto the table.

	"I KNEW IT!  I knew you wouldn't believe me!  But it's the truth, I'm 
telling you!"  Tenchi heard it suddenly go quiet behind him.  He turned around 
to see a good portion of the lunchroom staring at him.  His three friends 
stopped laughing as well, and looked up at him, confused.  Tenchi blushed and 
slowly sat down.  He heard some of the other students behind him start muttering 
amongst themselves.  "Now look what happened.  You're all insensitive jerks."

	Yuri reached out and put her hands on Tenchi's.  "Gee, I'm sorry, kid.  I 
didn't mean it.  It's...it's just it sounds so...crazy.  I mean, you ARE just 
kidding, right?  You don't actually expect us to believe that story, do you?"

	Tenchi pulled his hands away and grimaced.  "Of course I do.  I don't lie 
to people, especially my friends.  You know that."

	"Oh, I see," Yuri said.  "Well, maybe you're...maybe you're sick.  You 
know, delusional.  Maybe the stress of all that studying and living without a 
girlfriend has finally gotten to you.  They do have a good counselor here, you 
know.  Maybe..."

	"I'm NOT delusional!  Man, even when I tell you guys the truth you still 
won't quit bugging me.  Here, look!"  The time had come to pull out the big 
guns.  Tenchi reached down and pulled out his bag.  He fished around inside and 
pulled out two items.  The first one was the image he had drawn of Mihoshi.  The 
second was the Master Key, which he had with him all the time anyway.  He put 
both up onto the table.  Yuri reached over and took the picture, and Amagasaki 
picked up the sword, turning it over and examining it.  While they were looking 
them over, Nuriko spoke up.

	"Say Tenchi, I also heard you say the name 'Ryoko.' Is she another friend 
of yours?"

	"More or less.  You know how last year after summer break I told you about 
spending it with dried up old mummies, Amagasaki?  Well...she's the mummy I 
spent it with.  Only she was not really a mummy, but the daughter of another of 
my friends, Washu.  She was created thousands of years ago, but she still looks 
like a teenager.  Oh yeah, and Washu is even older than that, about 20 thousand 
years old.  She's also the smartest person in the whole universe...even smarter 
than Hizaka-san."

	"Even smarter than that geek?  She's the smartest kid at this school!  I 
never see her outside of the science labs," Yuri said, surprised.

	"You have NO idea, Yuri," Tenchi replied, his eyes half-lidded.

	"Hey, Tenchi, this sword hilt looks really old.  But where's the blade?  
Did it break off or something?" Amagasaki asked.

	Tenchi decided that what he had already told them was enough for one day.  
"Yeah.  See, it was really rusted, but the hilt survived.  I...found it in my 
grandfather's cave last summer."  Well, Tenchi, it's not REALLY a lie, he 
thought.  You DID find it there, after all, and the blade DID break off.  But I 
really don't think they really care what the actual truth is.  They just want to 
hear some juicy gossip.  Typical teenagers.

	"Boy Tenchi, she's CUTE.  Mihoshi, right?  And you say you're friends with 
her?  What a catch!  But if she lives at your house, why haven't I ever seen her 
go to school here?" Yuri asked after looking over the drawing.

	What?  Was she even listening?  Oh well, he thought, if telling them the 
truth doesn't even make an impact, I suppose there's no chance of them leaking 
the news to the public.  That's the LAST thing he wanted...reporters and cameras 
at his house all day, bugging his family for interviews about the "strange 
aliens" that have decided to crash at their house for the duration of their 
natural lives.  They'd never have a moment of peace.  Grandfather would have a 
fit.

	"She...uh, she went to a different school.  Yeah, really out of the way."  
Yeah, try about fifty billion miles out of the way, you nosy little girl, he 
thought to himself.  "She graduated awhile ago too, so she's just been bumming 
around with us, trying to find work and stuff," Tenchi explained.

	Yuri's face lit up.  "Ooooh, an older woman, huh?  Tenchi, you little 
player you!"  She peered back down at the drawing and suddenly noticed 
something.  "Hey, look at this, you guys.  Yeah, those ears are definitely 
strange.  What is she, Tenchi, an elf or something?"

	Tenchi reached over and took the drawing back, folding it and shoving it 
back into his bag.  "N-no.  Wow, huh, I guess I just messed up on her ears.  
Looks like I need more practice.  I'll take back the sword too, Amagasaki."

	Amagasaki handed him the hilt, but not before Yuri grabbed the end of it.  
"Ooh, pretty jewels!  Rubies?" she asked.

	"Y-yeah.  Real ones, too, not the fake kind," he said as he practically 
wrenched the sword from her hand.  He stuffed it back into the bookbag and 
shoved it under the table once more.  Yuri simply shrugged and continued eating.  
The other three did the same.

**********************************************************

	After lunch, as Tenchi was headed back to class, Nuriko walked up beside 
Tenchi as he was crossing the lawn to the main building.

	"Hiya, Tenchi.  I want to apologize for what I did earlier.  I'm really 
sorry," she said, quite sincerely.

	"Oh, it's all right, Nuriko.  I'm just...a little embarrassed about my 
art.  You caught me a little off-guard.  I normally don't draw nudes," he said.

	"Actually, I know how you feel.  I never wanted to tell you this, but...in 
my creative writing class, all my stories...they're all about sex.  You know, 
real hardcore stuff."  She blushed pink and looked down into the books she was 
holding across her chest.  "I guess...I guess it's my way of getting out all 
those thoughts I have, you know, of boys.  Until Amagasaki came along, no boy 
wanted to go out with me.  They all said I was too fat.  It's all those stupid 
teen magazines, Tenchi!  All they show are skinny little waifs that look like 
they're starving.  I mean, I tried being like that, and I got real sick from not 
eating.  And I STILL couldn't get any guy to look twice at me.  So then I came 
to my senses and decided that if no boy would want me, I'd just write about it, 
and stay big and fat, just to spite them.  But then Amagasaki came along, and he 
likes big girls, so..."

	Tenchi stopped in the middle of the spacious lawn, and stepped in front of 
her.  "Nuriko, I don't think you're fat at all.  To tell you the truth, you 
actually sort of remind me of one of the girls I know at home, Ryoko.  While you 
and her do have very different personalities, I can see that you're as strong-
willed as she is.  You may not know it, but guys find confidence more attractive 
than anything else.  Well, I do, at least."

	Nuriko looked up at him and began to tear up.  "Oh, Tenchi, that's so 
sweet.  Even Amagasaki doesn't say things like that to me!"  She suddenly 
dropped her books and embraced Tenchi.  Wow, that's the third time in less than 
two days, he thought.  I guess I really *must* be a girl magnet.  "You're such a 
sweet guy, Tenchi.  Thank you."

	Though they were set back some from the public area, Tenchi still began to 
feel eyes pressing on him, so he slowly broke from Nuriko's grasp.  "Okay, 
you're welcome...you're welcome.  Here, let me get your books."  He knelt down 
and scooped up her textbooks.  She also knelt down and began helping him.  As 
she reached for the final book, which was near Tenchi's foot, she leaned over 
and kissed him lightly on the cheek.

	"Thanks again.  And you want to know something?  I believe your story...I 
really do.  See you at class."  She stood up, books in hand, and began jogging 
towards the main building, leaving Tenchi stunned, kneeling on the grass.

*********************************************************

	"So, *yawn* what do you want to try next?" Ryoko asked Mihoshi tiredly as 
she lay on top of her on the couch in the living room, half covered by her dress 
and glistening with sweat.

	Mihoshi, equally sweaty and dishevelled, replied from underneath in a 
still cheerful yet also tired voice, "Dunno...what've we done so far?"

	Ryoko groggily brought her hand up to her face and began counting off on 
her fingers.  "Well...we've done it in seven positions so far, including that 
one that I had no idea you could pull off.  I sucked your tits, you sucked mine, 
I ate your pussy, you ate mine.  You know, I'm clean out of ideas," she mumbled 
nonchalantly.  "Want to stop?  We've been lying here like this for 10 minutes.  
This is getting pretty fucking boring."

	"*YAWN*...Only if you want to..."

	Ryoko smiled weakly, reached up and touched Mihoshi's cheek.  "You're good 
at this.  I have to admit, even I'm impressed.  We've been at this for, like, 
two hours.  Your...stamina...is amazing.  Now if I can just get Tenchi to do 
this with me we'll be all set."  She thought for a moment.  "You know, I could 
have sworn I heard something near the kitchen while I was eating you out.  Did 
you see anything, I couldn't tell.  If it was Aeka..."

********************************************************

	But of course it wasn't Aeka.

	For deep within the bowels of Washu's lab, in a large circular chamber, a 
massive projection screen was showing the "action" from earlier between Ryoko 
and Mihoshi.  Towering speakers surrounded the room, and untold hundreds of 
other electronic devices, familiar and not, cluttered the area below the screen.  
All sorts of cables and wires splayed across the floor.  Washu was sitting 
amongst this gargantuan entertainment system in an oddly out of place plush easy 
chair, munching on popcorn.  Moans and screams of pleasure bellowed from the 
speakers and reflected off the walls.  Thankfully, this lab was soundproof, 
though even if it weren't, no one in the Masaki household was likely to hear, 
for it was located 270 light-years away on a moon of Beta Vulpeculae.

	"Wow, this is great stuff!  Some of my best footage yet of her sexual 
activity!  Good thing I made that light-scattering fabric.  I KNEW I was going 
to find a use for it sooner or later...those kids didn't suspect a thing, I was 
completely concealed!  Oh, the joys of motherhood.  The best part is now I don't 
have to rely on just those tapes that Noboyuki made of Ryoko masturbating in the 
bathroom, now I've got *solid* research material."  She took another bite of 
popcorn.  "I can't believe how well Mihoshi is doing.  I would have expected her 
body to give out under that kind of physical intensity and strain long ago, but 
she just keeps going.  Those Kizakans sure are a tough race.  Still, it would be 
nice if Ryoko tried out that technique I taught her...oh, there we go!  Wow, 
Mihoshi sure is flexible...I didn't know she could bend that far."

	CRACK!  "Owww..."

	"Oops, sorry Mihoshi."

	"...That's...okay...Ryoko."

	Washu grimaced.  "Ooh, I guess she can't.  Ouch."

***************************************************************

	Meanwhile, back on the Earth...

	"I didn't see a thing...you must be hearing things, Ryoko.  Better get 
your hearing checked.  Washu can do...that.  She's wicked smart," she rambled 
out.

	"'Wicked' smart, huh?  Where'd you get that from?"

	"Heard it on some show from those states...things.  The U.S. or whatever.  
I was flipping around between the GP news and some funny stuff from there."  She 
paused a moment and struggled weakly a bit.  "Hey, Ryoko, I think I'm laying on 
that remote I lost again half an hour ago.  It's making my butt go to sleep.  
Can you get off me for a minute?"

	"Durr, Mihoshi.  You've gotta stop losing things.  All right, I guess it's 
time to clean up..."  Ryoko slowly pulled herself off of Mihoshi, phased out of 
the air for a moment and then reappeared fully dressed in a pair of jean shorts 
and a tank top, standing next to the couch.  She began combing through her hair 
with her hands, trying to smooth it out.

	Mihoshi pushed herself slowly up onto her elbows.  "Ow, ow ow.  The whole 
left side of my body is asleep.  Feels like pins and needles shooting through 
me.  Can you help me up, Ryoko?  I can't quite disappear and reappear like you 
can."

	"Sure kid.  Here," Ryoko said as she reached out a hand to Mihoshi, who 
took it and pulled herself to her feet.  She stood there fully naked as she 
tried to wake up her leg.  She shook it as she hopped on her right foot, finally 
waking it up.  She reached her arms over her head and gave herself a good, deep 
stretch.  Ryoko, still in a somewhat playful mood, phased behind Mihoshi and 
slapped her lightly on the ass.

	"You awake yet?" she asked, looking at Mihoshi's butt.

	Mihoshi jumped a bit, then turned to Ryoko.  "Stop that, Ryoko!  You 
goof!" she giggled.

	"Yeah, *I'm* the goofy one.  At least I don't sleep with a stuffed 
monkey."

	Mihoshi turned back around.  "Hey, that monkey has a name you know.  His 
name is Mr. Chimpy, and I only sleep with him because he's really cute and I 
like cute things.  Is there a problem with that?"

	"Yes, of course there is!  A grown woman like you sleeping with stuffed 
animals.  Why'd you have to tell me that when we were going at it?  It kind of 
ruined the moment for me."

	Mihoshi's voice hardened some.  "Ryoko, remember, *you're* the one who 
jumped on *me,* not the other way around.  If you can't handle hearing about 
what I like, then maybe we shouldn't do this again.  I just...don't think we're 
right for each other."

	Ryoko folded her arms and rolled her eyes.  "Well, of *course* we aren't.  
It's not like we're going to become a couple now or anything...so don't get that 
idea.  It WAS fun, but that was ALL.  I mean, didn't you have fun?"

	"Of course, Ryoko."

	"Then let's leave it at that.  Just don't think of trying any of that crap 
we did today with Tenchi, or I'll gut you with a rusty spoon," she half-joked as 
she made stabbing motions at the air in the direction of Mihoshi.  "And if you 
tell ANYONE about this, I'll make sure that your *tongue* is the first thing to 
get gouged out."

	Mihoshi backed away and cringed a bit.  "Um...okay.  I didn't really think 
of it, but I'm glad you pointed it out, Ryoko...heh heh."  She put her finger to 
her chin and looked up thoughtfully.  "But, now that I think about it, I don't 
think we HAVE any spoons around here.  Don't we eat everything with chopsticks?"

	Ryoko stopped cold and dropped her hands.  "You're...kidding, right?"

	"Not really.  If you want to gut me with something, it's going to have to 
be chopsticks, because we don't have any..."

	Ryoko held out her hand to stop Mihoshi, and dropped her head into her 
other hand.  "Well, *I* was kidding.  Sort of.  Look, just keep it a friendship 
between you and Tenchi, alright?"

	"Oh, okay!  Sure, we'll all still be friends!"  Mihoshi began bouncing up 
and down bubbily, causing Ryoko to take her turn at cringing.

	"Uh, maybe you should put your clothes back on before you do that.  
It's...unnerving to see you bounce like that."

	Mihoshi stopped and looked down at herself.  "Oops!  Heh, guess I do have 
to get dressed, don't I?  Heh heh, kinda forgot there for a moment."

	"Why am I not surprised?" Ryoko mumbled under her breath as Mihoshi slid 
into her panties and pajamas.  "You know, I can't believe you wear those things, 
Mihoshi."

	Mihoshi began to smooth out her own hair now, though there wasn't much 
that could be done for a mass as unkempt as hers.  "Hm?  What things, Ryoko?" 
she asked as she retied the bow into her ponytail.

	"The underwear.  Seems like those things are awfully uncomfortable.  I 
like the feeling of nothing at all, you know.  Feels so much better, you should 
try it sometime."  Ryoko twirled around like a fashion model and looked at 
herself.

	"Uh, I don't think so.  They're really comfortable...I can't imagine going 
a day without wearing them.  I mean, what if I wanted to wear a short skirt or 
something?"

	Ryoko pulled a confused expression.  "I don't see your point."

	Mihoshi face-faulted.  She slowly stood up and rubbed the back of her 
head.  "Well, Ryoko, there are just some things you'll have to find out for 
yourself, I guess."  She caught a glint of sun in the corner of her eye and 
turned around to look out the window.  "Hey, Ryoko, it's stopped raining!  The 
sun's out!"

	She floated over to the window.  "Really?  Wow, it's about damn time."  
Suddenly, Ryoko shuddered violently as if she felt something cold surge through 
her body.  She clutched at her head and leaned up against the window.

	Mihoshi stepped closer and reached for the pirate, concerned.  "Ryoko, 
what's wrong?"

	Ryoko didn't answer.  She eventually stopped shivering, slowly opened her 
eyes, and panted heavily, out of breath.  She shot a glance at Mihoshi, stood 
up, phased herself through the glass and began flying off.  Mihoshi pulled open 
the door and called to her.

	"Hey, Ryoko, where are you going?"

	Ryoko stopped in midair.  "I promised myself I was going to go flying 
today.  I need some fresh air.  Be back by dinner!"

	"Wait, don't you want something light for lunch first?  I think you should 
at least take a snack with you!" the detective called back.

	Ryoko paused a moment.  "You know, that's a good idea."  She then phased 
out again.  Mihoshi could not see where she went.

	"Ryoko?  Where'd you go?"  Mihoshi shrugged and went back inside.  She 
then heard clinking noises coming from the kitchen.  She pulled open the door to 
see Ryoko busy at the fridge.  "Oh, so you did decide to have something."  She 
stood there and watched as the pirate laid out two halves of an entire loaf of 
bread, upon which she began piling meats, cheeses, pickles, lettuce, onions, 
half a jar of horseradish, an entire tomato, about a pint of...

	"Um, hey, excuse me, Ryoko?  That doesn't quite look like a *light* lunch 
to me."

	Ryoko squished the top slice of bread onto her massive sandwich and took a 
bite.  "Hmmph?  Whut ah joo tahing uhbot?  Dis's uh laht lumch!  Bahsuds, ah 
bumt uhp ahl dose culorees wit joo!  Ut innt mah falmt, Muhosni!"  she mumbled, 
spraying crumbs all over.  She swallowed her first bite, wiped her mouth, and 
exclaimed, "Yeah, good stuff!  I'll just take the rest with me.  Bye now!"  
Ryoko flew up and phased through the ceiling, taking the rest of the sandwich 
with her.  Mihoshi could see her flying off over the treeline through the window 
a moment later.

	Mihoshi blinked a few times, sighed and shook her head.  "I have NO idea 
what she just said."

********************************************************

	The light elevator rose to the ceiling of the tube, and Washu stepped out 
into the familiar surroundings of her primary work area, drenched in a bright 
but comforting light, simulating sunshine.  She lazily stepped out and shuffled 
over to a tree near one of the waterfalls that cascaded down the sides of the 
wooden platform.  She plucked off a small leaf and looked intently at it.

	"Hmm, these need some better light if they're going to grow properly.  The 
leaves are so small, I wonder what I did wrong."  She sat down on the edge of 
the planter and tossed the leaf off the side, watching as it twirled its way to 
the frothy foam at the bottom of the falls.  She kicked her legs at the side and 
stared up, deep in thought.  "Wow, this is really something else.  Ryoko has 
never manifested erotic feelings this intense before, especially towards someone 
like Mihoshi.  It's funny; I didn't wire her consciousness to tend towards 
homosexuality, yet she showed those feelings so early on in life.  Almost after 
I created her I felt a strong affection from her towards me, like what she 
expressed with Mihoshi...but I didn't guess at the time that it was sexual in 
nature.  Strange...something must have triggered her latent homosexual urges.  
Hmm, perhaps part of her is so intent on repressing those feelings that her 
heterosexual emotions have been enhanced, blown up almost to the point of 
absurdity.  Tenchi may just be a pawn for Ryoko's struggling mental state...I'll 
have to do a more thorough mental scan on her soon to be sure.  But if that's 
the case, and her homosexual urges ARE rising once again to the surface, it may 
not be too long before Aeka is victimized."

	Washu looked down into the water, tried to repress a laugh, and couldn't.  
She clasped her hands together.  "Oh, that would so perfect!  Aeka'd never see 
it coming...'Oh Aeka dear, I've loved you for SO long, but I only pretended to 
hate you to keep my deep passion for you a secret!  Take me, my sweet princess, 
make love to me!'"  Washu threw her hands out in a mock imitation of her 
daughter, and fell back onto the floor, giggling.  "Ohh, this is why I LOVE 
parenthood so much!  It's like a soap opera every day with her!  But of course 
it'll never happen.  At least I HOPE not, I'd hate to have to clean up the 
damage done after Aeka blows her stack..."

	Just then, a loud beeping began coming from her virtual console across the 
room.

	"What in the world?"  Knowing it not to be a good sound, she shot up and 
ran over to her workspace.  She punched a few keys on her holotop and brought up 
a large viewing screen in front of her.  Working feverishly, she shook her head 
in disbelief as the readings she was getting kept getting confirmed and 
reconfirmed.

	"But...what is this?  There's a subspace wake approaching Earth from 
Sirius?  But that's in the direction of the GP fleet headquarters!  Why would a 
shuttle be jumping to this system?  Could it be Mihoshi?  Wait...no, of course 
not.  Even if she could have traversed that distance in the time that I've been 
down here, she'd never have gone THAT way.  Seventh HQ is on a totally different 
azimuth.  And the hyperspace signature is odd...much stronger than normal."

	She suddenly doubled over and grasped her head.  It felt like a million 
voices were screaming at her inside her mind.  The pain was nearly unbearable, 
and she dropped to the floor, convulsing in pain.  After a few moments, it 
subsided.  Panting heavily, she slowly stood back up, bracing herself on her 
floating cushion.

	"Such...such a terrible energy.  Something is not right here...I'd better 
tell Mihoshi."

****************************************************************

	"In a stunning development earlier today, Fleet Commander Shinobu's 
assistant, Miarra Kanashima, fell ill with an as yet unknown ailment.  She is 
currently being treated in the medical ward at Central Headquarters.  Her 
condition is critical but stable, and doctors are being called in from across 
the galaxy to assist in her recovery.  Despite this development, the memorial 
service for Marshal Anderson is still scheduled for 0700 Galactic Time on the 
27th," the young GHK news anchor reported as stock video of various GP officials 
being interviewed rolled by on the flat screen television located in the Masaki 
family's den.

	"Oh my, this is really bad.  How could this happen again so soon?  I'm 
going to have to get over there and see what's going on!"  Mihoshi exclaimed as 
she sat at the table, listening to the broadcast and munching on some leftover 
rice crackers.

	The footage ended, and the young anchor reappeared on the screen.  "Both 
of these cases are currently being investigated by the Galaxy Police special 
forensics unit.  However, due to a lack of evidence, it is unknown whether 
Marshal Anderson's death will be charged as a criminal case."  More footage 
rolled, this time of Commander Shinobu, standing in a hallway and surrounded by 
reporters carrying numerous cameras and microphones.  Flashbulbs popped off 
around him as he spoke.

	"I assure you, the Galaxy Police will not stand for this sort of 
horrendous terrorism against our own people.  It is my duty and honor to root 
out all those involved and bring them to justice, no matter what the cost," 
Shinobu said firmly to the circle of reporters around him.

	"But Sir, Sir!  Is it not true that the Galaxy Police have already chosen 
Marshal Anderson's replacement?  What of the Holy Council of Jurai's decision to 
postpone elections until the case is solved?  Is the Galaxy Police going to 
disregard their ruling?" one of the reporters asked as he stuck a camera in 
Shinobu's face.

	A vein on Shinobu's forehead began to bulge out in obvious frustration.  
He held back what he intended to say, and instead replied, "No, of course not.  
Jurai's jurisdiction is paramount in situations such as these...I have already 
ordered a halt to the elections until the Holy Council votes to resume them.  
I'm sorry...no more questions.  I have other responsibilities...that's all for 
today."

	The reporters were shuffled about as the commander pushed his way roughly 
through them, and the full-screen footage shrank to a small inset next to the 
anchor.  "That was Fleet Commander Shinobu Yoshita today at Central 
Headquarters.  It is currently unknown when elections will resume, but we will 
keep you informed of any further developments..."

	Mihoshi's attention was suddenly distracted by her watch communicator, 
which began to beep on the table next to her.  She picked it up and, noticing 
that it was a signal from Yukinojo, clicked on the transmit button.

	"Yes, Yukinojo?"

	The voice of her loyal computer responded.  "Mihoshi, I am receiving a 
signal for you.  Please transport over to the shuttle immediately, it is marked 
extremely urgent."

	Mihoshi's eyes lit up.  "Oh, of course Yukinojo!  At once!"  She shoved 
the rest of the cracker she was eating into her mouth, stood up, and fished 
around in her hair for her cube.  She pulled it out and twisted one side of it, 
immediately disappearing from the den.

	Just then, the door opened to Washu's lab, and the scientist stepped out.  
"Mihoshi?"  She looked around.  Hearing the television in the den, she peered 
around the corner.  "Mihoshi, I've got to tell you some...thing?  Where the hell 
is that girl?  I could have sworn I heard her out here just a moment ago..."

	Suddenly, Washu heard a familiar splash coming from somewhere outside the 
house.  She rushed outside, only to see Mihoshi pulling her soaked body out of 
the lake onto the dock.  Washu stopped in front of her and put her hands on her 
hips.

	"Decide to go swimming today?  I can't say I'm much of a fan of your 
choice of swim wear, but the time is right."  Mihoshi grabbed her shirt and 
tried to wring some of the water out as she stood there, dripping and shivering.  
"So I guess you were trying to get on your ship, right?"

	"Uh-huh."  Mihoshi nodded weakly.  "W-Washu, can you...?"

	"Already on it.  Here," Washu pulled up her holo-top, typed in a few keys, 
and pulled an object from a hole in subspace.

	"Oh, why thank you Miss Wa..." Mihoshi did a double-take as she saw what 
it was.  "Huh? A *hair dryer*?"

	"Yep.  It's even battery-powered so you don't have to plug it in!  Genius, 
I tell you!"

	Washu wagged her finger at Mihoshi.  "Hey!  It's been a long day, alright?  
I couldn't come up with anything better right now.  You should be thankful 
you've got THAT."  She shot a glance at the pitiable, shivering Mihoshi, who 
just stood there holding the dryer limply in her hands.  She finally gave in.  
"Oh, all right.  Hand me your cube."

	Taking the cube, Washu deftly turned it over and over until the two women 
disappeared from the dock.  Onboard the shuttle, the two reappeared, 
materializing in Mihoshi's quarters.  Washu stood as she had a few moments 
before, but Mihoshi was now not only dry, but in her GP uniform.

	Mihoshi patted herself on the arms and chest.  "H-hey!  I'm all dry!  
How'd you do that?" she asked as Washu tossed the cube back to Mihoshi, who just 
barely caught it.

	Washu put her hands behind her head and began casually strolling about 
Mihoshi's room, bending over occasionally to stare at one or the other of the 
detective's many books and personal items.  "Oh, that's just one of its simpler 
functions.  I think that cube may be a little misaligned, though.  I noticed 
that I had to correct for that when teleporting over here.    So for once, it 
may be your equipment that's at fault, not you.  What a kick, huh?"  She bent 
over and picked up a stuffed monkey from a table.  "You know, this is the first 
time I've ever been in here.  Who is this?"  Of course, Washu knew exactly "who" 
it was, having heard Mihoshi blurt out the name earlier in crystal clear stereo 
surround sound.

	Mihoshi seemed a little taken off-guard.  "Oh, that's...Mr. Chimpy.  He's 
my little friend that...I...sleep with..." Her voice trailed off to nothing and 
she turned her head away from Washu, obviously embarrassed.

	Washu put the stuffed animal back down and stood up.  "You probably think 
that's strange, huh?"

	"...Well, Ryoko said it was," Mihoshi said very quietly.

	"I'm going to give you some advice, Mihoshi.  Don't listen to Ryoko.  
She's having some emotional trouble right now and probably can't be relied on 
for much in the way of sage advice.  And I'll tell you something else.  I know 
how lonely it can get sometimes, out on your own without anyone to touch or hug.  
I feel that way all the time, so I understand the need for something to cuddle 
up to.  Especially with someone like Tenchi around.  So don't even worry about 
it.  Okay?" Washu said in a very comforting voice.

	"Yeah..."

	"Good!  So, what's this all about?  I have this nagging feeling that it 
might be related to what I have to tell you."

	Mihoshi brightened up immediately.  "Oh right, the message!"  She rushed 
out the door and through the short hallway to the cockpit.  Washu followed 
behind.  As soon as Mihoshi appeared, Yukinojo dropped down from the ceiling and 
spoke up.

	"I have been waiting, Mihoshi.  Are you ready to receive the message at 
this time?"

	The detective straightened out her uniform.  "Yes, of course."

	"It is encoded on Secure Channel Three.  I shall now open the link."  A 
communications window immediately sprang up in front of the duo.  The aged face 
of Commander Shinobu immediately presented itself.  His grim expression 
immediately conveyed the weight of the message.  

	"Greetings, First Class Detective Mihoshi.  I am Fleet Commander Shinobu 
Yoshita from the Central Headquarters of the Galaxy Police."

	"Hi, Commander!  What's going on?" Mihoshi asked cheerily.

	"I am sending you this message to request an extremely important favor 
from you.  Your cooperation in this matter may well determine the future of our 
entire organization.  As you are now aware, Marshal Anderson has died of an 
unknown illness.  I am now also saddened to report that my own personal 
assistant, Lieutenant Miarra Kanashima has fallen with a similar illness." His 
voice immediately cracked, and he began to choke up.  "Her condition at this 
hour is very grave, and our physicians are completely helpless to stop it from 
progressing.  If something is not done soon, she will die as well.  I am aware 
of your reassignment to the Sol system, and also of your acquaintance with Washu 
Hakubi."  Washu, hearing her name mentioned, stepped into view of the screen.  
The Commander stopped a moment and looked at her.  "Is...is this Miss Washu, 
Mihoshi?"

	Mihoshi began to speak, but Washu interrupted her.  "Yep, in the flesh, 
Commander.  I guess you guys over there at HQ have been in it pretty deep in the 
last day or so, huh?" Washu said in a tone she reserved for situations she knew 
to be especially bad.  "What are her symptoms?"

	"Her pulse is very weak.  It seems to be weakened by some sort of poison 
that has moved up to her heart.  I don't know how much longer she can hold on.  
Will you help us?  Please, Washu, you have to.  You're the only one left who 
can," he pleaded, his tone urgent.

	Washu lowered her head and averted her eyes from his gaze.  "I'm sorry, I 
can't."

	Shinobu and Mihoshi immediately blurted out, "WHAT?"

	Washu turned back to the commander.  "You heard me.  I cannot help you.  
Believe me, it's not a decision I'd like to make on my own, but there are other 
factors that are preventing me from doing so.  You have my condolences, but 
that's ALL.  It's not my problem."

	Shinobu's tone turned angry.  "Grrr...you *can't* help us, or you *won't* 
help us?  Which is it, Washu?"

	"It's both at the same time, and neither one nor the other.  I have 
already sworn to Jurai that I will not create another Ryoko, and I will also not 
create a fleet of Ryo-ohki's for their military.  I haven't gotten to where I am 
today by sharing my scientific knowledge with any charity case that comes along.  
I fear that if you people get ahold of even a millionth of what I know, it would 
severely unbalance the powers in this galaxy.  I cannot have that."

	Shinobu found himself desperately trying to search for something to tell 
her.  "That...that's unbelievable.  You...you have to!  There isn't much time 
left for her...we don't even know what it is.  Look, all I know is that she was 
poisoned by something placed in a drink.  Then there was the shuttle that I 
tried to contact..."

	Washu's eyes went wide.  "Shuttle?  Commander, was that a Galaxy Police 
shuttle, like this one?"

	"Why yes, I tried to contact one earlier.  I have a feeling it has 
something to do with all this.  But how did you...?"

	"Listen, Shinobu, earlier today I picked up a subspace wake coming from 
somewhere near the outer edge of the solar system.  It's origin was Central HQ.  
This might indeed be related."

	Shinobu now brightened up.  "Then, then you'll help us?"

	"Well, I guess I really don't have a choice *now,* do I?" Washu said as 
she scratched her head.  "I'm involved just as much as you are.  I really don't 
like making these exceptions, but I guess I have to this once.  *Just* this 
once, because I kind of owe a favor to Mihoshi for 'assisting' me in my lab so 
often."  She turned to the detective and leered at her.  Mihoshi smiled 
nervously and waved.

	"Excellent news!  We shall immediately dispatch a patrol to pick...," 
Shinobu gushed.

	Washu waved him off casually.  "No need for that.  Keep yer pants on, I'll 
be there in a minute, Commander.  Just give me a second to punch in the 
coordinates," she said as she brought up her keyboard again and began to type.  
A few moments later, a door appeared in mid-air next to the viewscreen, an 
ordinary wood door with a knob that would have looked out of place if it hadn't 
have been created by Washu.  As Washu pulled open the door to step through, 
Mihoshi spoke up in a surprisingly subdued voice.

	"Good luck...Miss Washu."

	Washu smiled slightly, nodded and stepped through.  She closed the door 
and it vanished into thin air.  A brief moment later, Shinobu jumped as he felt 
a tap on his shoulder.  Washu stepped into the sight of Mihoshi on the screen.  
"Washu, how did you...?  The Sol system is over 40 thousand light years from 
here!" the Commander asked as he turned around to see her.

	"Oh, just a little trick of mine.  It sure was difficult the first couple 
of times I tried it, but boy oh boy does it save on the commute to work!  Okay, 
Mihoshi, we're all set here.  Be sure to tell everyone where I am.  I don't know 
how long this is going to take, but I'll be back once I'm done!  Toodles!"  
Washu wrapped her arm around Shinobu, smiled and flashed a "victory" sign as the 
viewscreen blinked out.

	In the succeeding silence, Mihoshi bowed her head.  Her eyes began to 
glimmer and tear up.  

	"I wish *I* knew how to help, grandfather..."

*******************************************************************

	"When our pride burns wild
	Even in those we hold dear
	Fire shall engulf love," 

	Katsuhito repeated to himself as he read from the haiku that lay before 
him.  "Ah, not so bad.  Might even be publishable, if I found the right channels 
in the city."  He looked over his shoulder at the dozens of other pieces of rice 
paper hanging up behind him.  So many poems, all written today by him.  Before 
the ink was even dry on the previous one, he had started the next.  It had 
continued this way for hours as he attempted to produce one that satisfied him, 
almost in an obsessive haze.  The rain earlier had only inspired him further, 
though the claps of thunder had occasionally distracted him.  Now, though, he 
put down his brush in its ceramic rest and stood up.

	"That's enough for today.  Tenchi will be home soon, and I have to set up 
for our daily practice."  He slid open the door to the shrine and stepped 
outside into the bright sunlight.  The rain had left the air smelling fresh, and 
the old man deeply inhaled it as he stretched out.  He looked up and noticed a 
familiar shape flying overhead.  It reminded him of something very peculiar that 
he had felt earlier that had prompted him to begin writing.  He decided to find 
out if she had felt it as well.

	"Hello up there, Ryoko!"

	Ryoko peered down to see Katsuhito waving at her to come down.  She ducked 
out of the sky and landed gently next to him on the grass.  "Hey there, old man.  
What's the news?"

	"Did you feel that today, Ryoko?"  He grimaced.  "While I was working on 
my poetry today, I felt an enormous surge of energy.  It felt similar to the 
surge I felt when Kagato appeared, but much harder to pinpoint.  Almost as if it 
was...everywhere at once."

	Ryoko nodded as the feeling came back to her.  "I think I did.  It was 
earlier, about noon...it chilled me right to my bones.  I couldn't figure it 
out; at first it felt like Kagato was back.  But even Kagato didn't emit this 
kind of power.  Strange...it felt empty, like there was no emotion there; no 
desire, no hatred, no *nothing.*"

	Katsuhito put his hand on Ryoko's shoulder and leaned in close.  "Listen.  
Don't tell Tenchi or anyone about this.  Until we know what we're dealing with, 
all this information can do is upset them.  I know how you are, Ryoko.  I know 
how hard it is for you to contain your emotions, but this is different.  You 
MUST cooperate, Ryoko."

	She stared into his eyes, and for the first time ever, she saw genuine 
fear.  Fear coming from the crown prince of Jurai, the man who had 
singlehandedly taken down the very woman he was now conversing with.  Ryoko knew 
he did not scare easily.  Whatever it was they had felt, it was major.  Now was 
not the time for disagreement.  "Sure, no problem.  I'll do it."

	"Thank you Ryoko."  Noticing a bag in her hand, Katsuhito grabbed her by 
the wrist and pulled her hand up.  "Hm?  What's in the bag?  A new brand of 
sake, perhaps?"

	She immediately pulled the bag and her hand away.  "None of your business, 
you old fart.  Even if it *was* sake, I'm sure as hell not sharing any with you!  
(Erk!)"  She caught herself too late.

	"Ah, so it's not sake, eh?  Well then, what IS in the bag?"  He leaned 
closer.

	Ryoko grew annoyed, and her voice took on a high tone.  "Hey, what is 
this, the Juraian Inquisition?  Keep out of my business, or I'll put you in your 
place myself!  I've done it before!"

	Katsuhito simply backed away and smiled.  He then cocked his head to one 
side and pretended to see someone.  "Oh, hey look, Ryoko!  Isn't that Tenchi 
coming this way across the hill?"

	Ryoko turned her head to look.  "Huh?  But I don't see Ten..."

	"Yoink!"  He swiped the bag away from her while her attention was 
elsewhere for that moment.

	"Yoink?" The pirate turned back and looked at her empty hands in shock.  
"Hey, you!  Gimme that back!"

	The old man looked inside, expecting to see a large bottle of sake.  
Seeing something entirely different, he closed the bag and handed it back to his 
old nemesis.  Clearing his throat, he said, "Oh, Ryoko, I didn't know you liked 
that kind of material.  Oh well, carry on."  He waved her off and started 
walking back to the shrine's entrance.

	"Hey, it's not for me!  I swear!"  But it was too late.  He had already 
walked back inside and shut the door.  "Damn it.  Now he thinks *I* like this 
crap.  Makes me almost reconsider buying the stupid thing.  Oh well, so what.  
What can I do?"  With that, she shrugged and flew off over the trees, back to 
the house.

***************************************************************

	After a few minutes of flight, Ryoko touched down on the stoop right in 
front of the house.  She looked around to see if there was anyone outside to see 
her.  Seeing no one, she cautiously slid open the front door and tiptoed inside 
with her bag.  She perked up her ears and listened intently for any sound from 
either of the lower rooms.  Hearing nothing, she slid open the door to the 
living room and stopped as heard snoring.  All too familiar snoring, at that.  
One quick glance over to the couch proved that it was her.

	"You have got to be kidding me.  Does Mihoshi sleep ALL day or what?  
Guess I can't blame her, I'm a little tired myself after all that.  But she must 
have gone *somewhere* today, she's in her uniform...," she muttered under her 
breath.  Seeing her chance, she snuck over to the closet next to the kitchen, 
carefully opened it, and put the bag inside.  She had not even closed the door 
when she heard a voice behind her.

	"And just what are you doing, Ryoko?"  She turned around to see Aeka 
standing behind her with her hands on her hips.  "Looking for something to pawn 
to support your sake habit?"  She then saw the bag on the floor.  "Oh, did you 
actually go shopping today?  That's a surprise.  Well then, I don't have to go.  
I was getting all set to, but if you've already got the groceries..."

	"Uh, these aren't groceries.  And don't even bother asking me what's in 
there, because you just know I ain't gonna tell ya.  Besides, you should stop 
being so nosy.  I have the perfect right to look around this house without your 
permission."  She folded her arms and stuck her nose up into the air.

	Aeka clenched her teeth.  "Oh, is that so, Ryoko?  I'll have you know that 
only *royalty* has the right to privileges like that.  And you definitely 
*aren't* royalty."  She added, under her breath, "Besides, it probably IS booze, 
knowing you..."

	"Hey, I heard that!  You take that back right now, or I'm gonna 'royally' 
kick your ass!"  Ryoko drew her hands back and charged an electrical blast.  
Aeka took up a fighting stance.  However, Ryoko dropped her guard when she heard 
Mihoshi wake up.

	The blonde sat up rubbed her eyes.  "Unng...can you two please stop it?  
Fighting isn't going to solve anything.  You two should know that by now."

	Ryoko rushed over to the closet and slammed the door.  She braced herself 
against it and smiled nervously.  "Oh, hi Mihoshi.  We weren't doing 
anything...just go back to sleep."

	"Huh?  Ryoko, why are you standing like that?  What's in there?" Mihoshi 
asked.

	Aeka, becoming disgusted by this odd behavior, simply turned her back on 
the pair and started for the door.  "Well, since it seems like neither of you 
are going to do much today, I guess it's up to me to go shopping."  Just as she 
was about to slide open the door, she turned back and said slyly, "Oh, and 
Ryoko, I'll be sure to buy lots of *milk* while I'm at the market.  I just know 
how much you love it.  I'll definitely make sure it's the *pasteurized* variety, 
since it's SUCH a favorite of yours."  Aeka laughed softly to herself and left 
the living room.

	Once outside, Aeka heard the muffled scream that she had expected.  She 
put her hand up to her mouth and giggled.  "Oh my.  She IS taking that a bit too 
harshly, isn't she?  Oh well, thanks for the entertaining morning, Ryoko."

	Back inside, Ryoko was fighting her intense desire to rocket through the 
window, tackle Aeka, and drown the meddling little rat in the lake once and for 
all.  Electricity crackled through her body as she stood stock still, shaking, 
her teeth and fists clenched tightly.  "That...little...BITCH.  I KNEW it!  I 
KNEW she was listening!  Fucking, goddamned, piece of stinking, rotten 
horseshi..."

	She suddenly silenced herself as Sasami came bounding down the stairs with 
Ryo-ohki close behind.  Ryoko stood there awkwardly with her mouth open as she 
stared at the little princess.

	Sasami rubbed her eyes and said, "Is everything okay?  I heard yelling 
down here and I got worried.  You're not fighting again, are you?"

	A sweatdrop appeared on Ryoko, she unclenched her hands and smiled a wide, 
fake smile that she hoped Sasami wouldn't see through.  After seeing the little 
girl nearly drown in her own tears this morning, she couldn't do anything else 
to upset her.  Aeka would have to wait.  "Heh heh, no, of course not, Sasami.  
We were just talking and stuff.  Mihoshi and I were just...uh, practicing how to 
pull off that really tough move in that video game of yours.  You know, 
Super...Duper...Ultra Creature Farmer, uh...X?"*

	"What?  No we weren't, Ryoko.  You were fighting with Aemmmmmph..."  Ryoko 
rushed over and put her mouth over Mihoshi's.

	"Shuddup, you," Ryoko whispered harshly under her breath.

	The princess brightened up.  "Oh, I see!  That's a really cool game, 
Ryoko!  I didn't know you liked it so much!  Maybe we can play it sometime!"

	Ryoko chuckled.  "Um, yeah, sure.  Sounds good.  Maybe later, okay?"

	"Okay!  Say, Ryoko, Ryo-ohki and I are going out to play for awhile.  When 
my sister comes back, tell her where I am, okay?"  Ryoko nodded and Sasami 
bounded out the door with the cabbit close behind.  With them gone, Ryoko 
breathed out.  She reached over the back of the couch and grabbed Mihoshi by the 
shirt.

	"Damn it, Mihoshi, you told me you didn't hear anyone!  Is everyone going 
to hear about what the hell we did?  Why don't we tell Sasami while we're at it?  
I'm sure *she'd* just LOVE to hear all about it!"

	Mihoshi cringed.  "But I really didn't hear anyone, honest!  Please let me 
go, I didn't do anything..."

	Ryoko's muscles untensed and she let go of Mihoshi's uniform.  "I guess 
you're right.  Beating you up isn't going to solve my problem.  I just thought 
for sure no one was listening.  Don't worry, I'll get back at Aeka later," she 
sighed.  "Oh, that reminds me, I've got something for you.  It's not much, 
but..."  Ryoko opened the closet and pulled out the paper bag she had been 
trying to hide.  She placed it on the table and opened it.  "Go ahead, look 
inside.  I didn't want to bring it out with anyone else around, but now that 
it's just you and me, you know."

	Mihoshi eagerly reached into the bag and pulled out what was inside.  Her 
eyes immediately lit up, just like a child's on Christmas...or Startica, for 
that matter.  In her hands, Mihoshi held up a beautiful stuffed bear.  Its soft 
brown fur was accented by a pink bow tied around its neck.  In its paw it held a 
small box of chocolates shaped like a heart.  "Oh, Ryoko!  Is this little 
guy...for me?"

	"Yep.  You like it?  I was out and was going to buy some sake, but I 
stopped by this little shop next door that was selling these.  I didn't know 
which one to get, so I asked the guy working there.  You know, I wasn't going to 
get that, but with all that this morning, I felt sort of guilty.  And I know you 
like that cutesy stuff."  She smiled at her.  "I just hope you know what I had 
to give up to get that."

	"Oh, that's so nice of you!  I love him, I just love him!  Thank you so 
much!"  Mihoshi began tearing up.  She sniffled and hugged the bear tightly to 
her chest.

	Ryoko sat down on the edge of the table.  "Now now, don't start getting 
all weepy on me.  I hate that.**  Just consider this my formal apology." She 
pointed at Mihoshi.  "But now we're officially even.  Don't think I'm doing this 
again.  Sometimes I wish I didn't even *have* a conscience."

	Mihoshi suddenly put the bear down, hopped over the couch, and glomped 
Ryoko.  "Oh thank you thank you THANK YOU, Ryoko!  You're the best friend ever!"

	The pirate pried herself free.  "Ehhh...now I know what Tenchi must feel 
like when I do that to him."

******************************************************

	Meanwhile, halfway across the galaxy...

	"Nope, nope, I don't see anything.  Well, nothing that's making her sick, 
anyway," Washu said as she pored over the numerous diagrams and internal scans 
that she had displayed on countless dozens of translucent screens surrounding 
her.  She poked her head through one of the screens and looked at Miarra, who 
was intermittently tensing and relaxing, a sure sign of approaching death.  
"Poor kid...there just isn't anything wrong with her!"

	"Wait just a minute, Miss Washu!  You're saying that even YOU can't find 
anything wrong with her?  I refuse to believe that!  She's lying here dying and 
you're saying that you can't fix her!  What kind of crock of sh..."  The now 
furious Commander Shinobu was suddenly silenced by Doctor Yamato, who stepped in 
front of him and nudged him out of the way.

	"Hold on there, Commander.  Washu, have you tried scanning her astral 
pattern yet?  I have a good feeling that whatever is poisoning her may be on 
that level.  Didn't I tell you that the only way we could discover the toxin was 
to use a phased defect hull scanner?"  the doctor said as she stepped up next to 
Washu and looked over her readings.

	"What?  You didn't tell me that!  Let me check..."  She nimbly danced her 
fingers about, hitting one keypad after the other.  Some screens disappeared, 
and many others took their place.  Data began to fly by on the monitors at 
hundreds of lines per second.  She began to sweat as she attempted to keep up.  
Suddenly, the data stopped rolling, and Washu zoomed in on one scan in 
particular that was flashing red.  "Hel-lo.  What is *this*?  There's appears to 
be a dematerilization of the pattern structure on the astral level, just like 
you said.  It seems like her entire astral pattern is being phased into another 
plane of reality."

	The doctor appeared concerned.  "So you think that's why I was sensing 
hyperspace properties with the phase scanner?"

	Shinobu, who had been standing nearby, scratching his head, could take no 
more.  "Alright, ladies!  Can you please tell me just WHAT is going on with her, 
in plain Japanese?"

	Washu turned to the Commander.  "Yes.  Lieutenant Miarra is not about to 
die, at least in the sense we understand it.  Her astral pattern, or essence, is 
being sucked into another reality.  Since the physical body cannot survive 
without its essence, once this toxin finishes its task, she will disappear from 
THIS reality and reappear in another."

	Everyone seemed to notice the same thing at once, and all went wide-eyed 
at its implication.  "Doctor Yamato, where's this station's morgue?" Washu asked 
hurridly.

	The doctor had already started running for the door of the medlab.  "It's 
in Section 9, Block A!  Follow me!"

	During the run down the corridors, Shinobu, following close behind, asked, 
"Would someone mind telling me what we're going down to the morgue for?  What's 
going on Washu?"

	Washu, outdistancing both of them, replied, "If my theory is correct, then 
Marshal Anderson isn't dead at all!  Hurry!"

	Down about a dozen brightly lit corridors, and two elevators landed the 
trio at one of the more dimly lit levels, Section 9.  It was apparent from the 
lack of personnel traversing the hallways that this level was not visited often.  
Stopping next to the massive metal security door at a keypad, Shinobu punched in 
a code.  The door slowly slid open, spewing frosty air out into the hall.  They 
rushed inside the refrigerated chamber.

	"Lights!" the commander yelled, and the morgue lit up with lights from 
high above.  They revealed row after row of tubular refrigerated capsules, each 
stacked on top of the other.  They appeared to reach into infinity, disappearing 
into the fog above.  Shinobu walked up to one near the far wall that read 
"Anderson, W.S." and opened its outer, windowed door.  The capsule slid out and 
its top cover retracted to reveal...

	Nothing.

	No body, no blood, no anything.  The capsule was totally empty.  Shinobu 
stepped back in shock.  "I...I don't understand.  The Marshal was transferred to 
THIS capsule just four hours ago!"

	Washu stepped up and examined the capsule.  "Hmm, this is just as I 
expected.  Anderson is gone.  His physical body has completed its transfer into 
the alternate reality.  The question is, where is he now?"  She paused and 
simply stood over the capsule, remaining that way for one minute, then two.

	Shinobu grew annoyed.  "WELL, Washu, where IS he then?"

	"I don't know.  I've been trying to think of any pocket dimensions I've 
created that he might have vanished into.  But I just can't know for sure until 
I can pinpoint his astral signature.  And to do THAT would have required that I 
place a tracer bug in THIS reality, but now that he's gone, it's too late.  
It'll take me weeks to...wait a minute!  MIARRA!"

	The rush back to the medlab was twice as frantic as the initial rush down 
to the morgue.  All three knew that Miarra only had a short time left before she 
too would be gone.  The door had hardly opened to Medical when Shinobu noticed 
that Miarra had stopped moving.  He yelled out her name.

	"Miarra!"  The feline Commander immediately rushed over to Miarra and 
tried to grab her wrist.  However, as he did so, his hand passed right through 
her arm.  He recoiled in horror.

	Washu again stepped up and brought up her console.  "The poison is 
metabolizing faster than I thought it would.  I'll have to work fast," she said, 
her voice shaking.  She furiously began to type.

	On the bed, Miarra's body now began fading out in spots, appearing 
translucent.  In some places the trio could see the bed underneath where she 
lay.  It was a race against time, but just as Miarra faded out entirely, Washu 
hit the last key.  A point of light appeared over the bed, flew down onto the 
lieutenant's nearly invisible body, and disappeared with her.  The medical lab 
grew silent.  Then Doctor Yamato asked quietly, "Washu...did you?"

	"I did.  I just managed to get the tracker bug placed before she 
disappeared.  Now it's just a matter of pinpointing her signal.  If my other 
theory is right, she has gone to the same location as Anderson."  Behind her, 
Commander Shinobu broke down and collapsed onto the floor.

	"Oh, Miarra, Miarra.  Why?  She's gone...," he choked out, his face in his 
hands.  Washu, concerned, walked over to him and placed her hand on his back.

	"There there.  She's still alive, Commander.  I'll bring her AND the 
Marshal back, trust me.  Hey, after all, life is just a 'phase' in the grand 
scheme of things."

	Shinobu looked up and placed his hand on Washu's.  "Thank you, Miss 
Washu."

******************************************************

	"Have a good day, son," the driver called to Tenchi as he stepped off the 
commuter bus.

	Tenchi waved and climbed off into the sandy soft shoulder of the highway.  
He tossed his bag over his shoulder and started walking the short distance back 
to his house.  (What a nice day...so calm, so typical.)  After a refreshing walk 
down the bright, tree-lined road, he turned off down the narrow gravel footpath 
and came into sight of the large wooden entrance gate in front of the house.  He 
stopped dead as he saw a sight that caused his jaw to drop wide open.  Between 
Kamidake and Azaka stood Mihoshi, clad in nothing but a see-through black lace 
teddy and g-string.  She stood with her hands clasped in front of her, and her 
head slightly bowed.

	The schoolboy immediately turned bright red and dropped his bag.  His eyes 
went wide, and he stood in shock for a moment before his conscience got the 
better of him and made him avert his eyes and hide them with his arm.  "Mi-Mi-
Mihoshi?  What's going on...?" he managed to weakly get out.

	"We are sorry, Tenchi," Azaka said in his usual baritone voice.

	"We tried to stop her, but she insisted on coming out here to greet you," 
Kamidake replied in his rather higher-pitched one.

	Mihoshi picked up her head and sauntered over to Tenchi, her nicely 
rounded hips swaying with every step.  Tenchi couldn't help but take a peek, and 
noticed just how incredibly slender and feminine she looked without baggy 
clothes to hide her curves.  He also noticed how well the black lace accented 
her dark skin.  However, despite all that had happened at school today, he was 
so taken aback by her now that all he could do was stand in one spot, shaking as 
if he was afraid of her.  She reached out to him and wrapped one arm around his 
neck.  She leaned in close and whispered in a sultry voice quite unlike her, 
"Well, what do you think, lover?  I really enjoyed what we did last night, 
Tenchi.  I got dressed up like this just for you, you sexy boy.  So what do you 
think, do you find ME sexy?"

	He could feel her hot breath on his neck, and it tickled his earlobe.  He 
wanted to say something, but only dry, raspy sounds came from his throat.  He 
felt her erect nipples brush against his chest, and finally found his voice.  
"M-Mihoshi?  What's wrong with you?  Isn't it c-cold in that outfit?"

	She began tracing his finger around his chest.  This was starting to 
increasingly feel like Ryoko had created a doppleganger and made it look like 
Mihoshi.  There was absolutely no way that the blonde would ever act like 
*this.*  Whatever she was doing, it *definitely* was not like her.  He finally 
found his legs as soon as she started nibbling on his earlobe.  Tenchi quickly 
pulled away from her and darted off towards the gate in a frenzy.  He shot a 
glance behind him to see if she was following.  Big mistake.

	*WHAM!*

	He collided with the closed solid wood door hard, sending blood flying 
from his nose and him careening backwards onto the dirt.  His last sight was of 
puffy clouds passing slowly above him in a bright blue sky before his world went 
black.

	"Ten-chi...Ten-chi..."

	Light slowly returned, and he blinked his eyes open, his world slowly 
coming back into focus.  Mihoshi was leaning over him, her face *very* close to 
his.  He looked down and saw he was lying in his room, on his bed.  She was also 
still wearing the teddy.  Tenchi dropped his head back onto his pillow.  
"Haha...so it wasn't a dream."  Still too weak to move, he just lay back and let 
whatever was going to happen, happen.

	Mihoshi pulled a tissue from the box on the nightstand next to his bed and 
gently wiped some blood from his upper lip and nose.  "Well of course not, 
sweetie.  Don't move, you hit your head pretty hard when you ran into that gate.  
I just want you to lie here while I go make you some soup."  She began to get up 
and walk towards the door when Tenchi stopped her.

	"H-hey, Mihoshi.  What...what's happening?  Why are you dressed like that?  
Besides, it should be you who should be resting today, after what happened with 
Ryoko."

	"Huh?  Who is that?  You must have hit your head *really* hard, Tenchi.  
And you should know perfectly well why I'm dressed like this.  I always dress 
this way on our anniversary," she replied casually.

	"ANNIVERSARY!?"  Tenchi bolted up from his bed and tripped over his 
sheets.  He almost fell face-first onto the carpet, but caught himself and stood 
up.  Feeling a draft, he looked down and noticed he was stark naked.  He yanked 
the sheets off of his bed and frantically wrapped them around himself.  
"Mihoshi?  Just what is happening?  We're not married!  And where's Ryoko?"

	Mihoshi folded her arms and looked at him accusingly.  "I don't know who 
you're talking about, but of *course* we're married, Ten-chan.  We have been for 
over four years now, ever since the Galaxy Police were disbanded and taken over 
by Jurai.  I was out of a job, and your grandfather approved our 
engagement...you really don't remember, do you?"

	Tenchi grabbed his head and sat down on his bed.  "No...no I don't.  This 
is all wrong."

	Mihoshi slid open the door and stepped out.  "Well, see if you can 
remember while I go get you some chicken soup.  Don't worry, it'll all come back 
to you soon, hon."  She left and the door glided shut.

	Tenchi sat for a few moments.  He looked around his room.  Everything 
seemed normal, just as he had left it that morning when he left.  (Am I dreaming 
this?)  It couldn't be, he had just woken up in his bed.  (But how can this be?  
Ryoko...she never existed?  Or didn't I ever free her from the cave?)  He 
suddenly heard faint creaking noises coming from a room down the hall, in the 
direction of Mihoshi's room.  He couldn't go out there naked, so he grabbed his 
uniform that was draped over the back of his chair and got dressed.  After he 
finished dressing, he pulled open his door and snuck out into the hall, peeking 
around the corner to see if Mihoshi was there.  Seeing she wasn't, he crept down 
to the end of the second-floor hall and slowly pulled open the door to the 
detective's room.  What greeted his eyes was even more difficult to digest, even 
more bizarre, than Mihoshi had been when she had greeted him at the front gate.

	The creaking was coming from Mihoshi's bed, where Ryoko and Aeka were 
lying naked, head in each other's crotch, performing cunnilingus on each other.  
They were eagerly licking at the other's juices, and grabbing at the other's 
body hungrily as their lips smacked against the other's pussy.  To top it all 
off, standing a few feet away, behind a running camera and tripod, was Tenchi's 
father, Noboyuki.  He stood with a wide grin on his face, in front of a white 
backdrop that hung from the ceiling.  On it was written, in large kanji, the 
words, "When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall, and down will come baby, 
cradle and all."  Noticing the boy standing in the entranceway, both Noboyuki 
and Aeka turned their gaze towards Tenchi.

	"Oh, hello, Ten-chan.  Don't mind us, we're just having a little fight," 
Aeka said, her tone perfectly calm.

	"Fight?  But it looks to me like you're...," Tenchi was suddenly cut off 
by his father, who stuck a bowl of eggs under his nose.

	"Would you like a hard-boiled egg, son?  I made them myself just this 
morning.  It sure was difficult fitting them all into the pot at once, but I 
managed it.  Have one, they're really good.  So supple and firm," Noboyuki 
interrupted, his voice equally as calm as Aeka's.

	Tenchi backed away, and saw as Ryoko finally picked up her head to look at 
him.  "Yes, Tenchi, please take one.  Join us.  Have some fun.  You know you 
want to."  However, the face that greeted Tenchi was not Ryoko's, but instead 
Nuriko's, the girl he had talked to that day at school.  While her appearance 
*was* similar to Ryoko, she still looked extremely odd with her face in place of 
Ryoko's, framed by that spiky mass of cyan hair.  Noboyuki joined in the 
chanting, "Join us, Tenchi.  Join us."  His eyes were wide and his pupils 
dilated, almost as if he was on drugs.  Aeka finally joined in, and all three 
began to chant simultaneously, "Join us.  Join us.  Join us..."

	"W-who are you people?"  Frightened for his life, Tenchi ran out of the 
room, screaming.  As per the earlier accident, he looked back while running.  
However, instead of smacking into a wood door, he ran right into Mihoshi's 
cleavage.***  He stopped instantly and looked up.  Mihoshi was smiling down at 
him.  "Who are they, Mihoshi?  Who are you?  Please, tell me!"

	Mihoshi ran her fingers through his hair and hugged him close.  "Shh, 
that's just Nuriko.  She came here to live with us once the school burned down.  
Remember?"

	Tenchi pushed himself away from her.  "NO!  No, I don't!  I...I just came 
from school!  It couldn't have burned down!"  He shook his head, trying to wake 
himself up.  "Who are you, really?  Please tell me!  I have to know!"  He 
grabbed Mihoshi by the shoulders and shook her.  She simply grabbed his wrists 
and pushed him up against the wall, pinning him fast.

	"Tenchi, please, you're really upsetting me.  Besides, wouldn't YOU like 
to know?"  This last sentence she seemed to speak in a different voice, one 
slightly deeper and not quite her.  However, before Tenchi could figure it out, 
she leaned in and kissed him.  Having kissed her before, Tenchi knew the 
feeling, and it *did* feel like her.  Feeling himself becoming erect, he gave 
in, wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close.  He opened his mouth, and 
she opened hers.  The two lovers kissed deeply for a few moments, before Mihoshi 
slid Tenchi along the wall and back into his room.  She pushed him backwards 
forcefully, onto his bed.  (Well, if this IS a dream, I'd better make the best 
of it while I can.  I obviously can't stop her, she's too strong for me to 
handle.)  There was only one thing to do.  Tenchi quickly began unbuttoning the 
collar of his school uniform.  After a minute, he had the outer jacket off and 
his white dress shirt undone.  This too he pulled off and tossed aside onto his 
nightstand.  He began to unzip his slacks, when Mihoshi placed her hand over his 
and stopped him.

	"Now now, let ME do that, honey.  You know you always like me to do that 
for you."  She slid her hand over the front of his fly and stroked his erect 
penis through the fabric, causing sparks of lust to shoot through Tenchi's body.  
"Hmm, already set to go, huh?  Good boy," she purred.  "Let's see what you got 
me for our anniversary.  Time to unwrap my gift..."  Mihoshi grabbed his zipper 
and pulled open his fly.  The tip of his penis was just peeking over the top of 
his boxers.  Mihoshi brushed her finger against it gently, and then briskly 
pulled off his slacks and underwear at the same time.  Tenchi lay fully exposed 
to her gaze, his member bobbing slightly as blood rushed to fill its many 
chambers.  She tossed the clothes onto the floor and climbed on top of him, 
straddling her legs over his.  At this close range, Tenchi could see Mihoshi's 
thick bush of blonde pubic hair through the sparse lace covering her mound.  (Oh 
man, I hope this isn't a dream now!)  It was thrilling, too thrilling to not 
take advantage of.  Tenchi reached out and began stroking her bush through her 
g-string.  It was so incredibly soft, just like he remembered it when they had 
comforted each other a night (?) before.  (My god, what a beautiful woman.  So 
lovely...so gentle.)

	"My my, you ARE an eager little stallion, aren't you?  Well, since I'm so 
happy with MY gift, I'll let you open yours early."  She grabbed Tenchi's hands 
and slipped his thumbs under the spaghetti straps of her panties.  Tenchi easily 
caught on and slowly pulled her underwear down her thighs, exposing her very 
light blond pubic hair which stood out boldly against her dark skin.  It was 
untrimmed and wild, just as the rest of her hair was.  Tenchi nearly melted at 
the sight.  Between her slightly spread legs he could see the faintest hint of 
her vaginal slit.  Almost in response to his thoughts, Mihoshi turned to one 
side and lifted up her leg to pull off her panties entirely.  In doing so, 
Tenchi caught the first true glance of her slit.  It was dusty pink towards the 
inside, and blended gently into her true skin color at the outer edges.  Very 
slight hints of her inner pussy lips poked out at the top, but other than this 
interruption, it was a perfect straight line.  Dream or not, she was offering 
this beautiful prize to Tenchi of her own free will.  And Tenchi wasn't about to 
let this opportunity slide.

	With her panties removed, Mihoshi sat back up on Tenchi.  She lowered 
herself onto his penis, which was lying flat against his body.  She decided to 
tease him, and began slowly grinding her mound against his shaft, not letting 
him enter her yet.  While she was bucking herself against him, she reached 
behind her and slowly began to unclasp the bra portion of the teddy she was 
wearing.  Tenchi, always being one to help out, reached up to assist her.  
However, this he did in almost a trance-like state, as if he was under some kind 
of spell.  After a few moments of work, the fabric loosened, and Mihoshi reached 
back around to pull it free from her breasts.  Just as he had seen a preview of 
her pubic hair before she had removed his panties, he now saw her beautiful 
light brown nipples poking against the lace bra.  She finally satiated his 
curiosity and pulled the bra down, exposing nipples that were indeed as large as 
he had thought, each one almost engulfing the front of her tits.  They bounced 
slightly as her nipples caught on the edge of the bra.  Tenchi reached back up 
and cupped his hands underneath them, feeling the delightful weight of each one.  
After a few moments, Mihoshi bent down and pressed her cheek against his.

	"Oh, Tenchi-dono, I've waited so long for this.  But I don't want to wait 
anymore.  I want you to fuck me.  Please fuck me now, you sweet boy, as hard as 
you can," she said as she rubbed up against him like a cat.  She slid his 
earlobe into her mouth, and Tenchi felt her little fangs brush against his 
tender skin.  However, he wasn't afraid that she would bite down.  He trusted 
her.  Yes, he trusted her, more than anyone.

	"Mmm, Mihoshi.  Yes.  Anything...anything to make you happy again."  She 
sat back up, reached between her legs, and grabbed Tenchi's throbbing penis.  
(Boy, this sure isn't the Mihoshi I know, but who am I to complain?)  She guided 
the tip right to her entrance, but stopped suddenly.

	She stared right into his eyes and said, in the same unnerving voice she 
had used earlier, "You know this is all a dream, Tenchi.  You know it has to 
end, but you don't care, do you?  That's okay, I can keep you here as long as I 
like.  You love her SO much, but that love has to end sometime.  And when it 
does, I'll be right there to take your place.  And then...you're finished."  He 
looked into her face, and it was almost like he saw someone else, someone 
almost...male?

	But then it changed.  Her voice took on another tone, this one 
unmistakably female...but it wasn't Mihoshi.  "Please, listen to me, Tenchi.  
You have to help me.  I'm trapped here, and this is the only way I can contact 
you."  Her expression changed to one of extreme anxiety, and the odd voice 
continued, pleading, "You have to save me!  Please...my name is Miarra.  You 
don't know me, but you have to stop him!  Stop..."  Her expression abruptly 
changed again, to one of fierce anger.  Tenchi dropped his jaw, his brow a mix 
of confusion and horror.  It almost seemed like Mihoshi, or whoever she was, had 
two...no, THREE personalities competing for dominance within her.  However, 
before he could figure it out, he felt a shooting pain between his legs.

	"AHHHHHH!!!"  Tenchi screamed out.  He looked down at himself.  His penis 
had begun to move on its own, and the head opened wide, turned towards him, and 
revealed fangs quite similar to a snake's.  It snarled and snapped at him, 
before turning back towards the glorious slit above it.  It drove itself into 
Mihoshi of its own accord, and she screamed in orgasmic pleasure.  Almost 
subconsciously, Tenchi began to pump his hips up against Mihoshi (?), feeling 
the intense, almost heavenly pleasure of her warm vagina tightening against his 
hard sex.  Minutes passed, and clear, sticky fluid began to drip down his penis.  
Wet and sloppy smacking sounds began emanating from the area between her legs.  
Tenchi reached up, grabbed her hips, and began driving her tight pussy onto him, 
again and again, until, at the moment of climax, Mihoshi began to scream out his 
name.

	"Tenchi!  Oh, Tenchi!  Yes, yes!  Tenchi, Tenchi!..."

**************************************************************

	"Tenchi?  Tenchi?  Hey Tenchi, wake up!"  The voice had changed, to one 
much younger, far less unnerving, quite a bit more annoyed, and most 
*definitely* male.  Tenchi blinked open his eyes again, only to find that this 
time, he was staring right into the eyes of someone quite a bit less attractive 
than Mihoshi.  The rubber-band lips gave him away immediately.

	"Unn...hey, Amagasaki.  H-how long was I out?"  He rubbed his eyes and 
looked out the window of the bus, which was zipping past a row of ramshackle 
houses and barns; the outskirts of Okayama proper.  Tenchi was quite familiar 
with the route his bus took, and almost didn't need his friend to tell him,

	"About 15 minutes.  Not too long.  Man, long night or what last night?  
You dozed off almost as soon as you sat down."

	Tenchi yawned rather loudly, causing Yuri, in the seat in front of him, to 
turn around and pop her head over the headrest.  "You might say that.  I don't 
think any of us got much sleep last night," he said, stretching his arms above 
his head.

	"Oooh, I bet I know why!  It was that Mihoshi girl, wasn't it, Tenchi-ii?  
'Good friend' indeed, you little scamp!  Tenchi's got a girlfriend, Tenchi's got 
a girlfriend!" Yuri teased as she reached over and put the tip of her finger on 
his nose.

	Tenchi swiped her hand away.  "I do NOT, Yuri!  I told you, her and I are 
just good...friends.  Stop it...jeez, you make us sound like an item or 
something."

	But weren't they?  That dream...was it a dream?  It felt so REAL, like he 
was actually IN that world.  But there's no way...he was on the bus, all this 
time, sleeping.  (Man, I can't start believing in stuff like this or I'm going 
to go crazy...)  And who was that strange voice?  So odd, then the other 
one...Miarra.  She needed...help?  From him?  And then he saw Nuriko...was he 
falling in love with her?  As if in response to his question, she too popped her 
head over the back of the seat next to Yuri's.  Tenchi jumped a bit as she saw 
her face, just as he had seen it in the dream.

	"I believe you, Tenchi.  Don't listen to Yuri, she's always saying stuff 
like that, annoying boys she likes with stupid questions."  Yuri turned to her 
and poked her in the ribs.

	"Nuriko!  C'mon, stop kidding around!  I don't like Tenchi!  Well...not 
that way."  They both sat down and disappeared from sight, continuing to mutter 
things like, ("Well, what's wrong with him?") and ("He's too skinny, I like boys 
with meat on 'em, like Amagasaki.") and ("Hey, he's mine, hands off Nuriko!")

	"So Tenchi, you up for a little baseball today?  Whaddya say, I got it all 
set up at my house.  Seeing as how it's spring break now, you can ride with me 
down to Takamatsu and play until dinner," Amagasaki goaded.

	"Uh, no, I don't think so.  I've got some things to take care of at home 
today.  Tell you what, later on in the week...maybe Sunday.  I'll give you a 
call, how does that sound?"

	Amagasaki appeared somewhat dejected at the news.  "Aw, man, you never 
want to do anything with me outside of school.  Boy, your grandpa sure keeps you 
busy, huh?"

	Yuri turned back around and poked her head up.  "Aww, poor boy.  *I'll* 
play baseball with you, sweetums."

	"Aw, you girls are no good at it.  All you ever do is whine about how hard 
the ball is thrown, and you can't even hit properly.  I'll take a pass on that 
offer," Amagasaki said in a haughty tone.

	Nuriko bounced back up and bonked Yuri on the head.  "Hey, he's MY man!"  
The trio continued to argue while Tenchi sat in his seat, staring out the 
window.  Finally, the bus turned down the all too familiar country road that led 
to his house.

******************************************************

	"Have a good day, son," the driver said as Tenchi stepped off the commuter 
bus for the second (?) time.  As he landed his feet on the shoulder of the road 
and waved back to the driver, an immense wave of deja-vu swept over him.  He 
grabbed his head and doubled over.

	"Say, are...are you okay?" the driver asked, concerned.

	After a moment, Tenchi recovered, and stood back up.  "I'm...fine, Sir.  
I'm okay."  The bus driver nodded, closed the door, and drove off, leaving 
Tenchi in a cloud of exhaust.  After a few moments of coughing, he said to 
himself, "Wow, what a strange feeling.  It almost feels like I've done this same 
exact thing once already today."  Searching his memory, he remembered what had 
happened after he had left the bus, and started running towards home.

	After taking the exact same path he had in his dream, Tenchi found himself 
back at the familiar sight of the Masaki house gate.  Only this time, there was 
no Mihoshi to greet him.  After scanning the scene, he dropped his head and 
sighed.  "Oh well.  I don't think I could have handled it anyway."  He continued 
his walk towards home.  Once he reached the gate, the two log guardians greeted 
him, just as they did every day.

	"Welcome home, Lord Tenchi.  We were expecting you," Azaka said.

	"You are home twelve minutes earlier than usual.  Is there a reason for 
your rush?" Kamidake asked.

	"No...no reason at all," Tenchi said in a cheerful tone.  (At least THEY 
never change.)  Tenchi suddenly perked up as he heard a piercing scream come 
from inside.  It sounded very young...Sasami!  He threw open the gate and ran 
inside the grounds, only to be met by Ryoko halfway on his dash to the field.  
"Ryoko, what happened!?"

	"I don't have time to explain, Tenchi.  Come on!" she yelled frantically 
and began flying just inches off the ground in the direction of the fields.  
Tenchi quicky nodded and followed as close behind as he could.  It didn't take 
long to see what happened.  As they rounded the corner of the house, Tenchi saw 
Sasami lying unconscious in a patch of grass, with Mihoshi kneeling next to her, 
cradling her head.  Ryo-ohki was pawing at her and mewing desperately.

	"C'mon, Tenchi, hurry!" Mihoshi called out, tears streaming down her face.  
Tenchi rushed up to her, dropped his bag, and picked the little girl up in his 
arms.  He put his ear to her chest.  Hearing nothing, he tried feeling her 
wrist.  Still nothing.

	"She's not breathing...Sasami!  Sasami, can you hear me!?  Ryoko, what 
happened?" Tenchi asked in a wavering voice.

	"I don't know!  I was inside with Mihoshi when Sasami came downstairs and 
went outside to play with Ryo-ohki.  A few minutes later, I heard her scream and 
then heard you come back.  It's almost like...she had a heart attack or 
something!"

	Tenchi stood up with Sasami cradled in his arms.  His expression turned 
very serious.  "That's impossible, Sasami is too young for that.  We have to get 
her to a hospital, right now.  Come on!"  However, as he started to run, Ryoko 
grabbed him by the shoulder and stopped him.  "Ryoko, let me go!  We have to get 
help!  Wait!  What about Washu...let's go get her!"

	"But Tenchi, Washu's gone.  She left earlier to go help the Galaxy 
Police!" Mihoshi blurted out hysterically.

	Ryoko bowed her head.  "And there's no time to get a doctor, Tenchi.  The 
nearest hospital is over 20 miles away.  Even flying as fast as I can, it would 
still take me 15 minutes to get her there.  She'd be braindead by then.  But..."

	"But WHAT, Ryoko!?  Hurry up!" he yelled at her.

	"Lay her back down on the grass...DO IT!  I don't have time to argue!"  
Tenchi quickly did as he was commanded.  Ryoko then knelt over her body and 
placed her hands over each side of her chest.  "Stand back!  I don't know if 
this is going to work, but it's our only option."

	Mihoshi, unable to watch, turned to Tenchi and pressed her face into his 
shoulder, still sobbing.  Tenchi reached around and hugged her close.  "I think 
I know what you're going to do, Ryoko.  And if it *doesn't* work, you'll fry her 
to a crisp."

	"That's a risk I'm willing to take.  It's even money either way, Tenchi.  
Either I do *this,* and risk frying her, or fly her to a hospital, and risk her 
ending up a vegetable.  Now stand back, I don't want either of you to get caught 
in the arc.  Just start praying that I've learned how to control my powers 
better."  Tenchi shut his eyes and braced himself.

	Ryoko charged electricity through her hands, and the air crackled with 
energy.  She closed her eyes and breathed out as she sent the first spark 
through Sasami's chest.  The little girl's back arched, then relaxed.  Ryoko 
checked her pulse.  Nothing.  Another spark of energy, barely a whisper of the 
demon's true power, but enough to cause Sasami to raise off the ground slightly.  
She checked again.  STILL nothing.  She tried a few more times, with the same 
result.  "C'mon, Sasami, don't die on me.  You're stronger than that, kid."  
Tears were now streaming down Ryoko's face.  "PLEASE!"  She sent one final arc 
of electricity through her.  The same tension, then relaxation.  Ryoko knelt 
there, her mouth open in anticipation.  Tenchi and Mihoshi turned to look.  
Ryoko collapsed onto the grass.  "No..."

	Suddenly, Sasami began to cough.  She turned over on her side and 
continued coughing.  It was the most beautiful sound in the whole world to those 
three right now.  Tenchi and Mihoshi rushed over to her and surrounded her.  
Tenchi reached down, brushed a few pieces of hair from her eyes, and again 
cradled her in his arms.  "Oh, Sasami, you're okay!  You did it, Ryoko!  It 
worked!  You had us scared, Sasami..."  Just then, the sound of rapid footsteps 
made them turn around.  Aeka was back, and made a beeline right for the group.  
Halfway to them, she dropped the plastic bags of food she had bought from the 
market.  She pushed her way in and unceremoniously dropped to her knees next to 
her sister.

	"Sasami!  Are you all right?  What happened here?  More of the same, 
Ryoko!?"  She shot an accusing glance at the pirate, who had walked a short 
distance away and stood with her back turned.  "Answer me!"

	"It wasn't Ryoko this time, Aeka!" Tenchi interrupted.  "Really.  She was 
the one who saved Sasami's life.  You see, Sasami was out here playing, and 
Ryoko said she heard her scream.  We all rushed to save her, but it was Ryoko 
who brought her back."

	"That's right, Aeka.  You should be thanking Ryoko, not yelling at her," 
Mihoshi added.

	Aeka looked stunned.  "Is...is this true, Ryoko?"

	Ryoko wiped some remaining tears from her eyes and said, "I'm just doing 
my job, princess.  No need to thank me.  I'd have done it even for...no, I'm not 
gonna say it."

	Aeka gently handed over Sasami to Tenchi.  "Could you take her inside and 
give her some water, Tench-sama?  Arigato."  Tenchi nodded and motioned for 
Mihoshi and Ryo-ohki to come with him.  Once they had rounded the corner, Aeka 
stood up and walked over to the pirate, who still had her back turned.  Aeka put 
a hand on her shoulder.  "Domo arigato gozaimasu, Ryoko-dono.  You know, all 
this time, I never thought you had that kind of heart in you.  No matter what we 
think of each other, I just want you to know how caring and unselfish that act 
was.  It's times like these that makes me hopeful for a...future friendship with 
you."

	The demon sniffled a bit and wiped her nose.  "Think nothing of it, Aeka.  
I didn't do it for you, I did it for Sasami.  I'm not a monster; I'm not going 
to stand by and watch children die.  Just consider this payback for that time I 
saved your ass when you were fighting Kagato."

	Aeka blinked a few times.  "Oh, that's right...you saved me from getting 
crushed by that pillar." she said humbly.

	"Of course, princess.  Besides, if I didn't save your life then, it would 
make my life a helluva lot more boring now, now wouldn't it?  I DO need someone 
to let out my frustrations on, after all," she said, chuckling.

	Aeka smiled at her.  "Right.  You know, I'm going to tease you about all 
that you did today for the rest of your life.  To think, Ryoko the mighty space 
pirate, saving the lives of those she cares about.  A paragon of Justice and 
Good!  What a scandal...it would ruin your reputation as a cruel and heartless 
demon," she joked.

	Ryoko turned beet red and swung around, enraged.  "Oh yeah!  Just go ahead 
and...try it."  She quickly deflated almost as soon as she had inflated.  
"Feh...skip it.  Let's just get the damn groceries and go see how Sasami is 
doing."

	Back inside the house, in much the same manner as Mihoshi had been that 
morning, Sasami was lying on the couch, propped up under some pillows.  Tenchi 
was sitting next to her, patting her head down with a cool facecloth.  He saw 
Ryoko and Aeka walk in, carrying a few bags.

	"Just bring those into the kitchen.  Mihoshi will help you put them away.  
She's in there getting Sasami a drink," Tenchi told them as they walked past.  
Under him, Sasami opened her eyes groggily.  He noticed this, and took the 
facecloth off of her forehead.  "Oh, hey Sasami, how are you doing?"

	She coughed a bit more.  "I'm okay, Tenchi-niichan.  My head just hurts a 
bit.  And...my mouth tastes like metal and smoke.  Yucky...feels like I stuck my 
finger in a light socket."

	Tenchi chuckled a bit in spite of himself.  "Oh, I think I know why that 
is, Sasami.  Do you remember what happened?  Anything at all."

	"I...was playing hide and seek with Ryo-chan.  All of a sudden, I got this 
great big headache and I fell down next to the shed.  It was so hard to...to 
breathe.  Then I guess I blacked out.  The next thing I remember is Ryoko-chan 
looking at me.  Why was she crying, Tenchi?  Ryoko *never* cries," she said 
weakly.

	He was about to tell her, then looked over to the kitchen and thought 
better of it.  "I'll...I'll tell you all about it one day, Sasami-chan.  For 
now, just be glad you made it."  His attention was suddenly drawn to the door of 
Washu's lab, which creaked open.  Out of the darkness came none other than the 
great scientist herself.

	"Oh, hey Tenchi!  What's the news in the Tenchi Universe?"  she asked 
cheerfully.  As soon as she saw Sasami, however, her mood turned somber.  
"Sasami?  Tenchi, what...?"

	"Come here, Washu, I need to ask you something," he said.  The redhead 
walked over, puzzled.  She reached down and felt Sasami's forehead.  "Washu, did 
you feel anything...strange, today?  Something is going on here, and its not 
just Sasami.  While I was riding home today, I fell asleep and had this really 
strange dream.  But it felt so real; I just don't get it.  Then, when I got off 
the bus, I got hit with some kind of nausea, a wave of throbbing pain that made 
me feel like my head was going to explode.  I nearly passed out on the spot.  It 
seems too similar to what happened to Sasami to be a coincidence.  Do you know 
anything about what's happening?"

	Washu leaned over on her elbows onto the back of the couch.  "I just don't 
believe this.  Those symptoms are *exactly* what Doctor Yamato described both 
Marshal Anderson and Lieutenant Miarra to be suffering from."  At this last 
sentence, Tenchi's eyes lit up.  "But why are we..."

	"Washu, did you say 'Miarra'?" he asked.

	"Yeah.  Miarra Kanashima, Shinobu's assistant.  You see, both her and 
Anderson suffered that exact same way right before they...disappeared."  
Noticing the implications, she continued in a subdued voice.  "Both her and 
Anderson were poisoned by some sort of trans-dimensional toxin.  It essentially 
causes the physical body to phase out of this reality, and into an alternate 
one."

	"In my dream, there was a girl named Miarra who called out to me to help 
her.  I couldn't do anything, Washu.  But it may be the same person."

	Sasami sat up and stared at Washu.  "Miss Washu, I'm not gonna disappear, 
am I?"

	Washu gave her a sympathetic look.  "Of course not, Sasami.  I won't let 
that happen.  But I still don't understand why you and Tenchi felt those same 
symptoms.  Tell me, Sasami, did you pass out...oh NO.  Tenchi, her heart didn't 
stop, did it?"  A quick look from Tenchi told her all she needed to know.  
"Damn.  It *is* the same problem."

	"But it's okay, Miss Washu.  I'm okay now, I feel great!" Sasami 
exclaimed.  She jumped off the couch and hugged Washu around the neck from 
behind.  "See?"

	"Oh, so it's gonna be like *that,* huh?"  Washu giggled, turned around, 
and tickled Sasami.  "Heh heh, well let's see if you're okay enough to handle 
the famous Washu tickle torture!"  She gently pushed Sasami onto the couch and 
continued to tickle her.

	Just then, Mihoshi came back through the door to the kitchen with a 
tumbler of water and a tray of crackers.  Ryoko and Aeka followed close behind 
carrying trays of tea.  "Here you go, Sasami!  Eat up!  Oh, you *are* up!  
Well...then just 'eat', I guess!"  She shrugged, sat down at the table, and 
grabbed some tea.

	"Oh, Ryoko, there you are!  Come here for a minute.  You too Aeka.  Gotta 
pry yer brains open and scoop out some juicy info."  They grabbed a few crackers 
and gathered around her.  "Okay, I need to know something.  Did either of you 
experience any kind of severe headaches or pain today, like...a shortness of 
breath, anything?"

	Ryoko and Aeka both looked away.  The old man had told Ryoko specifically 
not to tell anyone about the energy they had felt, but this was a whole new ball 
game.  She *had* to tell her.  "I...I felt the same thing earlier, Washu.  Right 
before lunch...it nearly made me pass out.  I'm not sure about Aeka, however..."  
She turned and narrowed her eyes at the princess.

	Washu did the same.  "What about it, Aeka?"

	"I..." Aeka sighed, blushed, and finally gave in.  "It was while I was out 
shopping at the market.  As I was going to reach for the eggs, I felt a sharp 
pain in my head.  I stumbled and...fell right into the arms of another man.  We 
both fell to the ground.  Unfortunately, the eggs broke...all over him.  I 
apologized of course, and he took it well enough, he even helped me up.  But all 
those people...they were laughing at me.  At ME, the crown princess of Jurai!  
How could they...I'm a dignified and graceful person.  Feel free to make fun of 
me any time you like, Ryoko.  I...I won't stop you."

	But Ryoko didn't.  She stood there without a trace of humor on her.  
"Don't worry about it, Aeka.  Hey, shit happens.  Besides, I really don't think 
this is a time to tease each other.  Isn't that right, Washu?"

	Washu folded her arms and nodded.  "That's right.  This is serious 
business.  If indeed ALL of you have experienced this same event, then that 
means there is some external force that is acting upon us.  I felt it too, and 
Tenchi's dream confirmed it.  Sasami suffered the most probably because her 
young heart wasn't strong enough to handle the intensity of the tremors.  The 
rest of us didn't even pass out, because our hearts are developed enough to 
withstand it.  And my time with the Galaxy Police just a few hours ago showed 
that people who are experiencing these symptoms are well on their way towards 
vanishing from our world...and reappearing in another one.  But Tenchi may hold 
the key I've been looking for.  Say, when did you have that dream today, Ten-
chan?"

	"Well, I was on the bus, and Amagasaki told me that I was only asleep for 
about 15 minutes after I got out of school, so it must have been sometime 
between 4:00 and 4:30."

	"Then that MUST be it.  Miarra disappeared just a few minutes before that 
time, so it must have been her that contacted Tenchi.  Now, I placed a tracer on 
Miarra right before she phased, so *now* I don't even have to search for the 
dimension.  I can just scan Tenchi's brainwaves and pinpoint her exact location 
myself."

	Tenchi grabbed at his head and cringed.  "S-scan my brain, Washu?  This 
isn't going to hurt, is it?  I know how you operate..."

	Washu walked over and patted him on the head.  "Now now, Tenchi darling, 
when have I ever hurt you?  I'm an angel of *mercy,* sweetie, not an angel of 
*death.*"  Her voice turned deadpan, and she yanked his ponytail.  "Try to tell 
the difference next time."

	"Y-yes, ma'am." She yanked harder.  "I-I m-mean, Little Washu."

	"Good boy," she told him, like one would reward a dog, and let go of his 
hair.

	"Hey, wait a minute here, not all of us felt that surge of pain.  What 
about Mihoshi?" Ryoko said as she pointed to the detective, who turned to the 
group, her face stuffed.

	Washu stepped up in front of everyone.  "I have a theory about that, 
actually."  Behind her, Ryoko mumbled something to the effect of, 'It figures.'  
Washu cleared her throat.  "Now, if you'll all just join me in my lab, I will 
demonstrate."

**********************************************************

	Once inside Washu's lab, the five found themselves in VERY familiar 
territory.  Enclosing them was the very classroom that they had been in half a 
year before when Washu tried to explain the Masu to them.  Washu, the last to 
enter, now walked through the group in her Galaxy Acadamy robes and cap.  Once 
at the podium in front, a screen lowered into place behind her.

	"I'm getting a *real* bad feeling about this," Ryoko muttered.  Just then, 
two rows of chairs and desks sprang up from underneath them, sweeping them off 
of their feet and forcing them to sit down.  "Oh no, not again!  I'm not sitting 
through *another* one of your damn lectures, Washu!" Ryoko tried to get up and 
leave, but suddenly, metal bars sprang from behind the chair and locked in 
place, holding her fast.  Ryoko tried to pry them open, but they wouldn't budge.  
"Wa-shuu!"

	"Now now, Ryoko-chan, don't make me turn on the electricity," Washu said 
calmly.

	"Electricity?  What electri--"  Ryoko's voice was abruptly cut off as 
vicious blue arcs jumped off of the bars.  Her hair stood on end as she shook 
violently, electricity coursing through her body.  After a few moments, it was 
turned off.  Ryoko slumped down, blackened and sizzling.  "...Oh.  *That* 
electricity...unnngh," she said, coughing out black soot.

	"Shocking, isn't it?" Washu asked slyly.  She cleared her throat.  "Now 
then, let's begin."  She pointed to the screen, on which first flashed a cartoon 
drawing of a smiling, chibi Mihoshi.  "This is Mihoshi, of course.  By all 
means, a normal girl with a just above average I.Q. of 137.  Betcha'll didn't 
know that, huh?  However, though she may appear normal on the surface, what 
hides behind that brilliant smile and those bright blue eyes are some awesome 
and downright frightening powers."  The slide then changed to a cartoon video of 
the same chibi Mihoshi, walking down a street in a somewhat jerky animation, 
complete with cartoon clouds and sun behind her.  "As Mihoshi has gone through 
her life, she has encountered a number of dire, life-threatening circumstances, 
all of which she has fortunately lived through, suffering no ill effects 
whatsoever."  As she spoke, a cartoon man wearing a mask and carrying a gun 
walked up to chibi Mihoshi and pointed the gun at her.  Chibi Mihoshi put her 
hands in the air, but then was saved as a huge safe fell on the would-be 
robber's chibi head.  He was squished flat, and chibi Mihoshi kept on walking.  
"Some may call this luck, some may call it fate.  But here's what *I* call it: 
the 'Chaos Field.'"

	"CHAOS FIELD???" everyone exclaimed at once.

	"Yes, Chaos Field!  What're you all, deaf?  Ahem, now then," she said as 
the slide changed again to one of chibi Mihoshi standing in the middle of a 
pulsating dome of energy.  "From what I've been able to determine, Mihoshi 
possesses an unusually large astral pattern, which radiates outward from her 
like a radar.  Whenever any harmful action comes within range of this 'chaos 
field,' it is dissipated in some form or another."  On the screen, various toon 
weapons began flying at chibi Mihoshi, including knives, bombs, karate-kicking 
ninjas, beakers of acid, and one very large nuclear bomb that said "1 Megaton" 
on it.  All either exploded or disappeared once they hit the field of energy.  
After the onslaught, chibi Mihoshi smiled, waved, and flashed a "victory" sign.  
Meanwhile, in her seat, the *real* Mihoshi giggled uneasily and slumped down 
into her chair, trying to hide from sight.

	"But wait a minute, Washu!" Ryoko called out.  "If she's got this field 
thingy, then how was I able to hurt her this morning?"

	"Aha!  Therein lies the *second* part of my theory, Miss Ryoko!  BUT, 
since you didn't raise your hand before asking, you get to suffer the Pocky 
Blocky!"  She pulled up her laptop and hit one key.

	"THE POCKY BLOCKY???" everyone exclaimed again.

	"Pssht, whatever.  Besides, I don't see what's so bad about..." Ryoko then 
heard something above her and peered up.  A huge shadow was forming over her.  
"...Pocky?"  Suddenly, a massive chocolate covered stick of Pocky dropped from 
the ceiling, right into her mouth.  Ryoko tried flailing her arms about, but it 
didn't work.  She grabbed at it and tried to pull it out, but that didn't work 
either.

	"That'll teach you to raise your hand next time," Washu scolded.  "Now 
then, let's continue."  Back on the screen, the slide changed one last time to a 
flow chart style diagram, with the head of chibi Mihoshi at the center.  "As we 
can see here, Mihoshi has alot of close emotional connections."  As she 
finished, many other chibi heads popped up around Mihoshi's, including Tenchi, 
Ryoko, Sasami, and everyone else in the household, including Noboyuki and 
Katsuhito.  Also included in that array of heads were those of Marshal Anderson, 
her ship Yukinojo, and even two that only Mihoshi recognized, that of her 
mother, Anna, and her former partner, Kiyone.  "Since the astral pattern is 
essentially a lattice of spiritual energy and emotion, anyone who loves or is 
loved by Mihoshi forms an astral pattern that resonates at the same or similar 
frequency.  BUT, those outside of her familial sphere do *not* exhibit this 
resonance.  Therefore, only family and friends can sneak in under this astral 
'radar' and harm her.  Anyone else immediately is picked up as an intruder, and 
their attack is subsequently thwarted by a combination of fate and physical 
manipulation of matter.  Understand?"

	She looked at the faces of her "students."  All showed that, indeed, they 
had not.  Ryoko was simply sitting there, unconcerned, munching on the giant 
stick of Pocky.

	A sweatdrop appeared on Washu.  "Eheh, I guess not.  Oh well, it's a good 
thing I had an experiment planned then."  She snapped her fingers, and the 
classroom instantly disappeared.  In its place stood a large domed chamber.  It 
was entirely wrapped in glass windows, and had a very large and menacing laser 
cannon on top of it.  Washu walked up to it and opened the sliding door that led 
inside.

	"My my, Miss Washu, this is one nasty looking piece of equipment," Aeka 
said.  "What are you planning to do with this?"

	"Heh heh, you'll see.  Now Mihoshi, just be so kind as to step inside, 
would you?"  Washu bowed and motioned her to go inside.

	Mihoshi backed away.  "Um, Washu, this doesn't look safe.  Are you sure 
about this?"

	"As sure as sure can be."  The blonde started easing towards the door.  
"That's right, just go on in and stand right on that bright red target.  Good."  
Once Mihoshi was inside, Washu quickly shut the door and went over to sit at a 
console next to the room.

	Inside, Mihoshi looked all around her at the bare white walls, ceiling, 
and especially at the huge painted target in the center of the floor.  She crept 
closer to it, one step at a time, until she was standing right in the center of 
it.  "Okay, Washu, what do I do now?" she called out, her voice echoeing 
throughout the chamber.

	"Just do what you'd normally do.  Be yourself.  And whatever you do, pay 
absolutely no attention to the barrel of that huge, deadly laser pointed at 
you," Washu's voice echoed back in a flippant and playful tone, filtered through 
a speaker overhead.  She seemed to be enjoying herself immensely.

	Tenchi then heard the whine of a generator powering up above him. Noticing 
that Washu was starting to aim the cannon, ran over to her.  "Hey, Washu, you 
can't do this to her!  You'll kill her!"

	Washu brushed him off.  "Don't worry, I know exactly what I'm doing.  
Computer, fire cannon, full power!"

	"WARNING.  HUMAN PRESCENCE DETECTED.  BIOLOGICAL SAFETY PROTOCOL PROHIBITS 
OPERATION," the mechanical voice from overhead responded.

	"Then override the protocol!  Passcode, um...,"  She looked behind her.  
Everyone was staring at her.  She turned back and mumbled, "Mary had a little 
lamb and her fleece was white as snow.  Damn Galaxy Police technology..."

	"THANK YOU WASHU.  FIRING CANNON."  Under the dome, Mihoshi suddenly 
caught a glint of metal out of the corner of her eye.

	"Oh wow, a dime!"  She bent over to pick it up, in doing so ducking out of 
the way of the blast from the cannon just in time.  The beam instead seared past 
and vaporized a section of wall behind her.  She stood back up and turned around 
to see the huge smoking hole in the wall behind her.  "Oooh, did I do that?"  
She pointed towards it.

	The four outside the dome could only stand there in stunned silence.  "See 
what I mean, guys?" Washu asked.  "If you need some more proof, let me try it 
again.  Computer, fire another round."  There was a whirring of gears above as 
the laser repositioned.  After a short whine from the generator, it fired again.

	"Hey, a fifty cent piece!"  Mihoshi exclaimed.  While running to get it, 
however, she slipped on a piece of the rubble from the wall and careened 
backwards.  Just as she did so, the laser beam shot past her, within inches of 
her face.  It instead only caught a few strands of her hair, which instantly 
disintegrated.  The beam slammed into the floor this time, blowing a huge crater 
into it and throwing up huge chunks of debris.  One landed right next to Mihoshi 
as she laid spread-eagle on the floor, dazed.  The item she had been trying to 
pick up landed on her chest.  She picked it up and looked at it.  "Aw, it's only 
a button."  She slowly picked herself up and brushed off.  "Washu, are we done 
yet?  I think I found all your change."

	Everyone face-faulted.  Washu picked herself up and said, "Not just yet, 
Mihoshi.  One more test.  Stand back on the target...or what's left of it.  Let 
me just adjust the beam here,"  She tinkered with a few knobs and buttons on her 
control console, then turned back to the group.  "What I'm going to do next will 
*prove* that only those who care about Mihoshi have the ability to hurt her.  
I'm adjusting the beam so that it emits only low-level photons, much like a 
light gun of a video game.  The reason I'm doing this is because I will now be 
*manually* controlling the laser, instead of the computer.  And I have the 
feeling that I'll hit her this time around."

	Another whine of the generator and whir of the gears and the laser was 
back on target.  Through the targeting screen, Washu could see Mihoshi staring 
right into the camera.  She placed the crosshairs right on the detective's 
chest.  "Oh how I wish getting rid of her was this easy...," she muttered.  Once 
the lock-on was achieved, she fired.  A red beam shot from the cannon and hit 
Mihoshi square in the middle of her chest.  She jumped backwards in fright, but 
then calmed down as she realized it wasn't going to kill her, feeling at her 
chest where it had hit her.  "Yeah, I got her!" Washu called out, pumping her 
fist in the air.  Inside, Mihoshi waved her hand through the warm, but harmless 
beam of red light.  She was then greeted by Washu as the door opened and the 
scientist stepped inside with her, followed by the rest.

	Washu reached out her hand.  "Congratulations, Mihoshi.  You have passed 
Washu's Chamber of Death with flying colors!"  Mihoshi stuck out her hand and 
Washu shook it numbly.  "See, guys.  Now you know what I'm talking about.  If 
that beam had been real, our favorite blonde bombshell would be just a smoking 
pile of ashes right now."

	"So it *is* true.  All those times when Mihoshi was in danger, it wasn't 
just her luck that saved her, it was the Chaos Field after all.  Amazing, Little 
Washu," Tenchi said to her.

	Mihoshi rubbed the back of her head and giggled.  "Wow, I thought I was 
just lucky."

	"Nope," Washu said as she snapped her fingers.  The entire chamber 
disappeared, and her arboretum-style lab reappeared.  "Okay, class dismissed.  
So all you get lost."  Everyone started for the exit door.  However, Tenchi was 
halted suddenly when Washu grabbed him by the waistband.  "Except...for you.  
Did you forget already?  I still need to scan you and find out just what was in 
that dream of yours."

	"Um, is that really necessary?  Can't I just *tell* you what was in the 
dream?" Tenchi asked, nervously.

	"No!  I need to go in there myself and see *exactly* what that dream was 
about, down to the last detail.  All the data should still be in your short-term 
memory, so I'll just need a few moments to set up the equipment."  She typed 
some commands into her laptop, and a large chair appeared out of thin air, with 
wires sprawling out from all sides.  She pushed Tenchi into it and clamped down 
a lighted metal dome on his head.

	Seeing all the activity, Mihoshi stopped at the door, turned around and 
came back.  "Ooh, hey Washu, can I stay and watch?" she asked, running up to the 
redhead.  Tenchi immediately blushed purple.

	"Uh, Mihoshi, there's really nothing interesting..." he started to say, 
but was cut off by Washu.

	"Sure, why not?  This should be fun!" Washu said as she hit one final key 
and brought down another large projection screen.  "And with this screen here, 
we can see just what Tenchi was dreaming about today!"  Tenchi, unable to move, 
simply gritted his teeth and tried to block out the world as the lights attached 
to the dome began to blink rapidly, and the footage began to roll by on the 
screen.  He was powerless to stop it.

******************************************************

	The sun had just set over the house by the time they finished..  Ryoko was 
catnapping on one of the rafters when she was awakened by the sound of the door 
to Washu's lab being thrown open.  The redhead stepped out, clutched at the 
wall, looked up and flashed Ryoko a dazed expression, and stumbled into the 
kitchen.  Ryoko simply shrugged and went back to sleep.

	Both Aeka and Sasami were in the kitchen preparing dinner when the 
scientist shambled in and slammed the door behind her.  They both looked behind 
them and watched as she stood there, shaking, drooling on the floor, and 
generally looking as if she had gone insane.  Her mouth gaped open, her eyes 
were totally blank, and there was a kind of giddy grin on her face.  She said 
nothing, but instead stumbled over to the fridge, pulled it open, grabbed a 
beer, and plunked herself down on the stool at the center counter.

	"Um, Miss Washu, are you okay?" Aeka asked as she stopped slicing the 
carrots she was working on and eased over to the redhead.  Washu popped open the 
beer and took a healthy swig.  She sighed and closed her eyes.

	"You...won't believe what I just saw, Aeka.  No wait, you probably 
shouldn't know.  Don't worry, I'm okay.  But after seeing *that,* I really 
needed a beer."  She finished off the entire can in one more swig and tossed it 
in the garbage.  She hopped off the stool and headed for the hallway.  "I'm 
going...upstairs.  Cold...shower, yes.  Taking *very* cold shower now.  Be down 
in...half hour."  She waved to the princesses and quickly disappeared from 
sight.  Aeka and Sasami both looked at each other, puzzled by her behavior.

	Meanwhile, back in the living room, Tenchi and Mihoshi stepped out from 
the lab and stood in the doorway.  They did not see Ryoko resting on the beam 
above.  They avoided each other's gaze, and both were blushing deeply.  Mihoshi 
had her head dropped to her chest.  "Gee, Tenchi...I didn't know you felt that 
way...about me.  You really think of me...like that?" she asked in a very 
subdued and quiet voice.

	Tenchi turned away from her and stared outside at the darkening sky.  "I'm 
so sorry, Mihoshi.  I didn't...I didn't mean for you to see that.  I'm so 
embarrassed."

	The blonde slowly walked over to his side and leaned up against him.  She 
folded her hands in front of her and nuzzled against his shoulder.  "It's okay, 
Ten-chan.  It was just a dream, after all."  She looked up and smiled at him.  
"And dreams can't hurt us, right?"

	Tenchi sighed and turned to her.  He gave her a quick smile.  "Right.  But 
Mihoshi...you know, I really do think of you like that...sometimes.  It's 
just...when I see you smile, and your eyes light up the way they do all the 
time, I can't help but think that I'd somehow be spoiling all that innocence if 
I were to...you know."

	Above them, Ryoko's eyes shot open, and she furrowed her brow deeply.

	"Oh, that's so sweet.  And if it makes you feel any better...I think of 
you like that sometimes too.  But I'm so afraid of getting in the way of you and 
Ryoko, and Aeka..."

	"You don't have to worry about that, Mihoshi.  I'm not *in* love with 
Ryoko or Aeka.  But I'm also not *in* love with you.  I love you all, but I don't 
ever want to have to pick one of you wonderful girls over the other.  I told you 
all before, I just want you as friends.  But to me, being friends means we share 
an even deeper bond than if we were lovers.  Understand?"

	Ryoko's expression changed to a kinder, more gentile one.  "Oh, 
Tenchi...," she sighed.  Satisfied, she smiled and fell back asleep, content 
that he had been honest.

	Mihoshi nodded.  "Hey, I have a great idea, Mihoshi!  Tell you what, since 
I'm on break now, why don't we do something special tomorrow, go somewhere or 
something?  We still have one day before we have to go to GP headquarters for 
the ceremony."

	"Well, I dunno, Tenchi, do you have any ideas about where we could go?" 
she asked.

	He thought for a moment, then replied, "You know what, I think I do..."

******************************************************

	"That's right dad, her and I are going to head over to Hiroshima for the 
day tomorrow.  I was just wondering if you had any idea of the best way to get 
there," Tenchi told his father as he spoke to him over the phone in the hallway.  
After dinner, he and Mihoshi had agreed that Hiroshima was indeed the city 
they'd visit, leaving early in the morning so that they could get away from it 
all at home and just spend a day recharging their spirits for the much longer 
trip ahead.  He had almost decided not to tell Ryoko or Aeka about the trip, 
until Mihoshi convinced him otherwise.  She was right, after all.  It was best 
to be totally honest with everyone, no matter what the end result was.

	"Well, I'm not so sure about the *best* way there, but you could always 
take the bullet train from Okayama city.  It should only take about a half hour 
to get there by bus, then another hour or so from Kajishima station to 
Hiroshima," his father replied through the speaker.  There was a short pause, 
then, "Of course, if you're taking *Mihoshi* with you, you could just get her to 
fly you over in her ship.  That's the quickest way.  Plus, then you and her can 
have a little 'quiet time' all alone, if you know what I mean, heh heh."

	"Dad..."

	"I know, I know, bad idea.  You don't want to alert the officials, 
either."  Another, longer pause.  "So how is everything else going there?  
Anyone killed each other over you yet?"

	Tenchi wanted to tell him.  He wanted to tell his father so badly about 
all that had happened that day, about the fight, about the disappearances, about 
the dream.  But instead, all that came out was, "Everything's fine.  You know 
how it is...one thing right after the other, heh heh.  It's crazy up here, but 
it's nothing I can't handle."  He didn't want to make Noboyuki worry about 
things that he couldn't help him with.

	"Good to hear, Tenchi.  Well, I wish you good luck on the trip.  Be sure 
to treat her like the lady she is, now.  Don't do anything dumb, like put your 
foot in your mouth."

	"Thanks for the advice, dad.  Bye."  Tenchi hung up.  He took a peek at 
the clock, and seeing how late it was getting, decided to head up to bed.  It 
had been the longest day in his recent memory, but at last it was over.

******************************************************

	Tenchi was at his closet the next morning, packing a few items of clothes 
and some personal supplies into his bag when Ryoko phased through his door and 
set down silently behind him.  She gave a quick look over his activity.  "So 
you're really going with her, aren't you?"

	He jumped at her voice, not hearing her come in.  "Oh, Ryoko, it's just 
you.  Yeah, I am going.  I hope that's not a big problem with you," he said as 
he stuffed his camera in next to the sunscreen and bathing suit.  If there was a 
good chance he could go for a swim, he was definitely going to take it.

	Ryoko looked down and began to pout, picking at the carpet fibers with her 
toes.  She put her hands behind her back and started making little noises.  "But 
I don't want you to go.  I wanted you to spend your spring break with me."  She 
brought her gaze up to Tenchi's and gave him an irresistable puppy-dog look.

	Tenchi zipped up his bag.  "I know you do.  But listen, sometimes you're 
just going to have to understand that I need to get out too.  I can't stay 
around and be your housepet, after all.  That's what you've got Ryo-ohki for."

	Deciding that her plan was ultimately futile, Ryoko straightened up.  
"Yeah, I see what you're getting at.  All I ever wanted for you is to be happy, 
Tenchi.  And if this really does make you happy, then I'm behind you all the 
way."  She pumped her fist across her body, then pointed right at him.  "But 
you're going to have to bring me back a souvenier.  Otherwise, I'm not gonna 
have any proof that you actually went there."

	"Heh heh, okay...'Mommy' Ryoko."

******************************************************

	The entire household had come out to see off Tenchi and Mihoshi.  Even 
Katsuhito had joined them.  Both came out of the house into an early morning 
light, the sunrise just starting to peek over the horizon.  It was hard to 
believe that just 24 hours ago their household was on the verge of total 
collapse.  But resiliancy is a Masaki family tradition, Tenchi told himself.  We 
get knocked down, but we always stand right back up, stronger than ever.  For it 
is in our love for each other that we draw our strength from.  He surveyed the 
faces of his friends before him.  Love for anyone from a demon to a princess, to 
a mad scientist and an officer of the law.  What had seemed so strange a year 
ago was now routine, now as much a part of waking life as eating and skipping 
rocks over the lake.

	"Here, Tenchi, I have something for you," Katsuhito said as he held out a 
small package.

	Tenchi took it and looked it over.  It was wrapped in simple brown paper, 
topped with a small Royal Teardrop flower tied to it.  "Grandpa, what's this?"  
Mihoshi leaned in and took a look as well.

	"For your grandmother, Tenchi.  Inside here are some very special items I 
want you to place at the memorial statue in Hiroshima Park.  You'll know why as 
soon as you read over the list of names enscribed on the plaque there just why 
I've given you those," he told Tenchi in a very serious tone.  "Let's just say 
that, during the great war back then, her and I were very close.  In fact, I met 
her when I was shot down over the Pacific ocean."

	Tenchi and Mihoshi both stepped back in shock.  "Grandpa, you were...a 
fighter pilot?"

	The old man paused a moment and looked off thoughtfully into the sky.  
"I've been many things in my life, Tenchi.  When I was shot down, I drifted for 
days until a hospital ship picked me up.  Your grandmother cared for me as a 
nurse onboard that ship until we reached port.  After the war, we promised to 
see each other again.  So we did.  Achika was the result.  We both ended up 
receiving commendations for our bravery by Emperor Hirohito.  However, when she 
died, I could never bring myself to visit her grave, or the memorial.  Then you 
started school, and soon after that, you released Ryoko.  So I haven't had much 
time to go there."

	"I'll do it, Grandpa.  You can trust me," Tenchi responded somberly.

	"You'd better get going.  The next bus is due to leave for Okayama soon," 
Katsuhito said.

	Tenchi nodded, and the three of them walked down to gate where everyone 
else was waiting.  Ryoko pushed open the gate for him.  Tenchi gave her a quick 
nod of approval, and she returned it.  Outside, Azaka and Kamidake said goodbye.

	"Have a nice trip, Lord Tenchi," Azaka told him.

	"We will be waiting in the same spot for you when you return, like we 
always are," Kamidake joked.

	Finally all set to go, Tenchi and Mihoshi waved their final goodbyes to 
the family.  They turned and headed down the road towards the sunrise, gleaming 
brightly with the promise of a new and better day.
