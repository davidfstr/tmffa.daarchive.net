This story was inspired by Dirty Cops YFUC: You Fucked Up Considerably
by Mark Eucep Tontelaers which was inspired by Dirty Cops by Dojin 
Diaster.  Each fic was about what happened when Kiyone and Mihoshi
hooked up in a rather odd way, and the aftermath of that.  My fic is
the aftermath of that aftermath.  
Of course, I do not own any of the characters portrayed here and I don't
get any money out of this either.  This fic is sorta limey and contains
an f/f relationship, and is horrifyingly cliche, so reader descretion is
advised.

		Dirty Cops 3: Baby Patrol (I know, very corny)
	
	"Kiyone, Kiyone! I think it's time!"  The blonde stumbled 
forward, one hand on her swollen stomach the other on the back of a chair
in the Masaki house.  
	"What? What?!  Oh my God, are you sure?!"  Kiyone ran over to
the mother of her about to be born child, Mihoshi.
	"Yes! This is it!"
	"Oh my God! I'm gonna be a father, or a mother or something..."
	"Kiyoooone!!  Get Washu quick!"
	Kiyone nodded and ran to get the little genius that would serve
as doctor.
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	"Aaah!"  Kiyone ran to the door that was seperated her from
Mihoshi.
	"Mihoshi! Mihoshi!"  She felt a warm hand on her shoulder and
turned to see Tenchi.  
	"She'll be fine Kiyone."
	"But they've been in there for so long..."
	"It takes a long time."
	Kiyone sighed and turned towrds the door again.  She was 
persuaded by Tenchi to finally take a seat between Aeka and Ryoko who
were also anxiously awaiting the new arrival.  She cringed when she
heard Mihoshi yell once more.  She cringed again as she thought of what
the chief and the rest of the Galaxy Police would think of her and 
Mihoshi's baby.  The Marshal took the news badly, having a heart attack
when he found out Mihoshi was pregnant.  He had 2 more when he discovered
that it was Kiyone's.  Thank goodness Washu was on hand.
	Kiyone's thoughts were cut short by Mihoshi's yells and moans
of pain.
	"Kiyooooone!!!"
	Kiyone shot up from her seat and bolted through the door to 
Mihoshi's side.  She was sweaty and moaning, and her legs were open
as physically possible.  Kiyone vaguely remembered a day from 9 months
ago.  She shook the thought from her head and held Mihoshi's hand with
both of her own.    
	"You're doing fine, Mihoshi", Washu said calmly, "just keep 
pushing and breathing."
	"Uuuuuuuugh!!!"
	Mihoshi clamped down on Kiyone's hand and practically ripped
the pillow she was clutcing to.  
	"That's it...here it comes"
	Kiyone tried not to yell out herself, Mihoshi was breaking her
hand.	
	"That's it Mihoshi, just a little more..you're almost there..."
	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"
	Within seconds Washu held a beautiful blue-eyed, teal-haired baby
girl.
	"Congratulations Mihoshi and Kiyone!" she said, happily handing
the baby to Mihoshi.  Mihoshi took her baby girl with tears in her eyes.
	"Isn't she beautiful Kiyone?  She has your nose and my eyes...and
you teal hair!  I'm so happy!"
	Kiyone looked down at her child lovingly and tearfully and 
gently took her from Mihoshi.  "Wow...this is mine"
	"Ours", corrected Mihoshi as Sasami, Tenchi, Ryoko, Aeka, Katsuhito
and Noboyuki surrounded them.
	"What will you name her", Sasami asked in awe of the newcomer.
	Kiyone looked from her baby to Mihoshi.  "How about Miyone?"
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	"Errrr..."
	Kiyone got up from bed for the third time that night.  She let
Miyone's crying guide her to the crib.  She scooped her little girl up
and carefully travelled down the stairs into the kitchen to fix Miyone's
bottle.
	"Hmmm...let's see here...breast milk powder? How does that work?
Feel like having that Miyo?  I guess you don't have a choice..." Kiyone
said absent-mindedly chatting with the 2-week old.
	Miyone squirmed a bit and "gaga-ed" cutely.
	"Ok Miyo here you go.  Here's the milky-poo, who wants the 
milky-poo?"
	"Oh Kiyone, you are so adorable!"
	Kiyone tensed, hoping that wasn't Ryoko, come to mock her
paternal position.  She relaxed as she saw Mihoshi walk towrds her.
	"You're such a cute daddy, Kiyone!"
	"Uh, thanks." She chuckled.  "I never imagined myself as 'the
daddy' though.  I was thinking I'd be in your place."
	"Oh...but in a way you are."
	"Hmmm, somehow I'm both, I guess."
	"That's a good thing!  That means Miyo-chan has an extra parent!."
	"Ummm, that's one way of looking at it, Mihoshi.  You do realize
we're in a rather odd situation."
	"....Yes."
	Kiyone patted her daughter's back, helping her release a louder
than usual belch.  Mihoshi giggled, patting her head.
	"I think she got that from me."
	"I see...Mihoshi, if Miyone ever asks, what do we tell her?
Ya know, about having two mothers and all."
	"But you're her 'father'."
	"I know...but technically I'm not anymore.  Right now it's just
female organs."
	"Oh.  We'll just tell her the truth."
	"What?!  We can't possibly tell her the truth!"
	"Why not?"
	"How am I supposed to explain to her that I swallowed some 
hermie pills, grew a penis, and then fucked you all in one day!?"
	"Shhh! You'll wake her!", Mihoshi whspered taking Miyone from
Kiyone.  "Gee that was all in one day wasn't it?  Anyway, I guess we
can't really tell her that."
	"Exactly!"
	"Shh!"
	"Sorry.  What if we say that...(gasp) Tenchi is her father!"
	"Tenchi?  Are you sure?  Ryoko and Aeka might get upset, it
would get very complicated and Tenchi would have to be some kind of
fatherly figure and we don't want to do that to him."
	"Your right...What about Nobo--eh forget it.  We have years
to think about it anyway."
	(Yawn)"Yeah.  We'll be lying to her though."
	"For her own good."
	"I guess.  She's asleep now."
	"Let's go back to bed too."
	"Ok...hey she's getting blonde highlights!"
	"How cute!"
	"Yeah, but it's sorta strange."
	"So are a lot of things..."
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
	"Pass me the spit-towel please, Sasami." 
	Sasami gave the half damp miniature towel to Mioshi and settled
down again to watch Miyone be breast-fed.
	"Sasami-chan, Aeka is calling you", Kiyone said entering the attic
room.
	"Oh, what does she want?", Sasami whined.
	"I think she's trying to cook."
	"What?!"  With that Sasami ran downstairs to prevent a potential
fire, leaving Kiyone to watch Mihoshi.  Kiyone looked from her child to
it's mother.
	"Lucky...", she muttered, referring to the baby being breast-fed.
	Mihoshi barely heard it, but caught the word nonetheless.  She 
smiled but still concentrated on her task.
	Finally Miyone belched and soon fell asleep.  Mihoshi gently and
carefully laid her in her crib.  She was doing lots of things more carefully
of late.  She sat down on the bed and looking exhausted.  
	Kiyone sat down next to her and put an arm around her .
	"Oh hi, Kiy-(yawn)-one."
	"Go to sleep and I'll take of Miyo."
	"No it's ok.  Ya know Kiyone, the baby is asleep and we are all
alone..."
	"Do you mean...You really want to?"
	Mihoshi nodded and giggled.
	"Ooohhh k...it has been awhile."
	"Mhmmm", Mihoshi agreed, already kissing Kiyone's neck.
	She pulled away and drew Kiyone into a deep, long kiss.  Kiyone
felt months of anxiety melt away.  She let her hands wander down from 
Mihoshi's face to her collarbone anf finally to her breast.  Kiyone took
Mihoshi's shirt off and massaged each tan mound.  
	"Ooooh...", Mihoshi moaned as Kiyone got to work licking around
her nipples.  
	"Ooooh, Kiyone that's so good...Oh Kiyone...Kiyone?  Hey, why'd
you stop?"
	"Ummm, there's a little...problem"
	"Huh?
	Mihoshi let the back of Kiyone's head go and looked down at her
mammories.  Breastmilk leaked out of her nippled and ran down her 
breasts and stomach.  
	"Oh my!"
	"Errr, yeah...here's a towel."
	"Oh thank- no wait, that's the baby's towel. Get that one."
	"This one?"
	"No that's the baby's towel too"
	"How many towels does a baby need?!"
	"Never mind I'll use this one..."
	"That's mine--eh whatever."
	Kiyone sat back down on the bed
	"There, that's better."
	"Mmm."
	They started to kiss again with renewed passion.
	*Knock*Knock*Knock*
	"Mmmm MMMmm" Kiyone said to the person knocking, still kissing
Mihoshi.
	*KNOCK*KNOCK*KNOCK*	
	"For the love of God!  What the fuck is it?!", Kiyone yelled
throwing open the door to find little Sasami.  
	"Dinner's ready", she said meekly, with tears in her eyes.
	"Oh! Sasami-chan, I am sooooo sorry! I didn't know! I'm so 
sorry!", Kiyone stammered out apologies and heard a baby start to cry 
behinf her.  
	After about 8 bows and thousands of apologies, Kiyone turned
to Mihoshi.  She was changing Miyone's diaper.  She sighed and put an 
arm around Mihoshi's waist.
	"Well she's awake.  I don't think she'll fall asleep for a couple
of hours", Mihoshi said heavily.
	"I see"
	"Gee Kiyone, being a mommy is really hard."
	"Yeah, so what are you saying?"
	"I don't think I want to have anymore kids yet..."
	Kiyone face faulted.
	"What?!  You wanted -more- children?  From me?"
	"Uh huh"
	"Are you serious?"
	"Yes!  I was thinking maybe you could get more of those pills and..."
	"Oh no, Mihoshi!  The next time I want to have a childe, I'll 
be the mother!"
	"Ohhhh!  I get it!  So you want me to take the pills!"
	"Aaaagh! NO!  Well I never thought of it that way..."
	
The End?
_____________________________________________________________________

The purpose of this fic was to propose what Kiyone and Mihoshi would  
have to deal with after the baby was born.  So what would happen as
Miyone grows up?  And what would happen if Mihoshi did Kiyone?
That's up to you and your imagination....
