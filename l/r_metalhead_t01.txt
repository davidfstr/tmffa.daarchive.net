Ultima Trev Proudly Presents:
"The Return of Metalhead Tenchi"

Part I: "Tenchi's Saiya-jin Heratige?"
________________________________________________________________________________
______________________________

Setting: The night after the Cannibal Corpse / Morbid Angel show. Tenchi and 
Mihosi are sleeping in Tenchi's bed. They have
managed to sneak past the others so a certain space pirate and certain Jurai 
princess wouldn't scold them. But all the sudden...

KNOCK KNOCK!!

"Tenchi, it's time to get ready for church!" said Nobuyuki. Tenchi replies: (in 
a very tired voice) "Do I have to go
today?" Nobuyuki thought to himself: * What's going on here? He usually loves to 
go to church. I better check on him to see what's
the matter. *

Nobuyuki opens the door...

"Tenchi, at last you have put you manhood to use!!" yells Nobuyuki. "Dad, don't 
yell it out like that!!" Tenchi replied. "What the Hell is
going on?!" said a certain space pirate. "Nothing at all!" replies a now 
petrified Tenchi. "I swear I heard the term man..." Silence goes
on for about one quarter of a minute. "You bastard, how could you betray me like 
this!!" said Ryouko with tears in her eyes. "I never
committed to you in the first place." Tenchi replies. "You will pay for this, I 
will see to it that you suffer the unbearable!!" says the
now furious Ryouko. "I doubt it, my l33t Juraian powers are far beyond your 
league. You have no chance." said a confindent Tenchi.
"Uh, I don't think fighting wouldn be a very good idea. The Masaki way forbids 
unnecessery violence!" said a freightened Nobuyuki.
"Meet me outside later, then we'll settle the score." said Ryouko. "As you 
wish." said Tenchi.

Ryouko heads to the back door, but gets sidetracked...

"Ryouko, why are you crying?" asks a worried Sasami. "Shut up!" snarled Ryouko. 
"Ryouko, please tell me what's wrong!" Sasami
demanded. "ALRIGHT!! Tenchi..." Ryouko is unable to finish "Tenchi what?" asks 
Sasami. "Tenchi has chosen Mihosi. He has
betrayed me!!" yells Ryouko. "So what will you do now?" asks a curious Sasami. 
"I will kill him." Ryouko says firmly. "You musn't!"
cries Sasami. (Ryouko suddenly vanishes) "This isn't good."

Outside near the pond...

"He better get his ass out here and quick." says Ryouko. "You won't be able to 
win, Tenchi's power is far greater than your own." (it
appears that Yosho is on the scene) "Well old man, I'd say you lost your 
senses." says Ryouko. "No, he will massacre you. He is not
only one 8th Juraian, but he is also one-fourth Saiya-jin." claimes Yosho. "What 
the Hell is a Saiya-jin?" asks Ryouko. "Saiya-jins
are the most powerful beings in the universe along with Angels. They have to 
power to destroy planets. Some Saiya-jins are good,
some are bad. Enraging Tenchi might force him to turn to the dark side." says 
Yosho. "Thanks for the advice, but I'm not scared of
anything." claims Ryouko. "YOU MUST RECONSIDER THIS FIGHT!! HE CARRIES THE VERY 
BLOOD OF MY EX WIFE ITSUKI,
WHO IS THE MOST POWERFUL SAIYA-JIN TO EVER LIVE!!" begs Yosho. Ryouko asks: "You 
sound serious, how powerful was
she? Yosho answers: "Her power was horrible."

Now Yosho tells the story of his wife Itsuki...

Flashback set to several hundred years ago, not too long after Yosho defeated 
Ryouko and settled down with the Masaki clan. In the
woods, a pretty looking female in a lion cloth is searching the woods. In handy 
she has a scouter, which will tell her how threatening
her prey is. "These people are weaklings. Clearing the Earth of them should be 
easy. Freezer will be sure to grant me a fat reward for
this." claimed Itsuki. When searching the woods for people to slaughter, she 
comes accross a villiage named Okayama, home of the
Masaki Shinto clan. "These people have power levels lower than feces!" said 
Itsuki with a smirk on her face. "I WILL KILL THEM
ALL!!" Itsuki then flies into the air and forms a ball of ki in her hands. "It's 
for this shit planet to die, Gamet Gun fire!!" She launches the
massive blast down at the villiage, but something absorbs it. "What the Hell?! 
My scouter is picking up a power level of 480,000!!"
yelled a dumbfounded Itsuki. "That would be me." said the Juraian Prince. "Who 
the fuck are you?! Are you one of Freezer's elite
Ginyu Force?!" Itsuki asked. "Incorrect. I am Yosho, heir to the thrown on 
planet Jurai." Itsuki then thinks: * Damn it! I've heard stories
of the Jurai Royal Family, each one has taken oath under the tree of light, 
giving them powers that almost match Freezer's own! *
Yosho speaks: "Young lady, it would be wise for you to surrender. I can sense 
your power without a mechanical device, it would
appear you only have a power level of 270,000." Itsuki replies: "You bastard, 
damn you for being so powerful!" Itsuki then fires a ki
blast at the guy. Yosho uses his single LHW to absorb it. "NO!!" yells an 
enraged Itsuki. Yosho gets the idea she won't surrender, so
he grabs and puts her in a massive bear hug. "Let me go!!" yelled Itsuki. Yosho 
replies: "Will you surrender?!" Itsuki answers: "Never!!"
Yosho then pulls harder. "If you will not surrender, you will be suffocated." 
Yosho said sternly. Itsuki thinks to herself: * I can't die. My
people are counting on me. My parents will be devestated if I don't come back 
alive. I must defeat him. "I must see to it that my race
prospers!!"

Yosho loses his grip as a bright light blinds him...

"Such power!!" yelled Yosho. Itsuki's Hairs grows astoundlingly, her eyes turn 
green, her hair becomes yellow, her eye brows fade
away. Yosho thinks to himself: * I can't tell what her power is, it's just so 
high! * Yosho notices her scouter on the ground, and dives
for it. "This can't be right! Power Level is 750,000,000 and rising!" Yosho 
looks on in horror as he can't figure out what to make of this.
"Now you pathetic Juraian, you will feel my unbridled wrath!" Yosho thinks: * 
How is this possible? She went straight from a low power
of 270,000 to a stage three Super Saiya-jin!! There's no way I'll be able to 
bring her down, even with the power of all ten LHWs!!
* Yosho summons all ten LHWs, but it only boost his power up to 117,000,000. 
Itsuki screams in the final area of unleashing her
power: "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!" BOOM!! An explosion engulfs an 80 
foot radius, luckilly Yosho is guarded by the
LHWs. "Well scumbag, looks like the tables have turned. I have achieved the 
stage 3 Super Saiya-jin level, and it's all thanks to your
pitiful effort to stop me." said Itsuki. Yosho inquires: "This is horrible, not 
even Lillith, the original spawn of Adam can generate this
much power!!" Itsuki states: "Too bad for you, looks like you're dogmeat." 
Luckilly for Earth, the Angels keep a close eye on things.
"Yosho, we can stop her." Yosho said: "Lillith, you've come!" "What the fuck is 
that? It's hideous!" yells Itsuki. "Yosho, merge with
me and our power over this Saiya-jin will be absolute!" Yosho responds: "I'll 
agree to it."

Another blinding light then engulfs the Okayama plains and plateaus. Even the 
SSJ3 is startled...

"Argh!! God Damn light." says Itsuki.

The transformation is complete, Yosho now has blood red eyes, sky blue hair, and 
Angel wings. Yosho has become ANGELIC
ULTIMA YOSHO!!

"Now Saiya-jin, you will feel the wrath of Heaven and Jurai!" claims the Ultima-
charged Angel. "Your words sound empty if you ask
me." replies Itsuki. Yosho then holds out a single hand. "Raging fires of 
Heaven!!" Itsuki then fires a ki blast of her own. "Gamet Gun
fire!"

End flashback...

"We battled for hours, and finally we got her in a fatal submission hold and 
forced her to surrender. She eventually calmed down and
became my bride. Around a hundred years later we gave birth to Achika, and from 
there you know the rest." Ryouko is speachless.
"Well, I hope you take my warning seriously." Yosho then walks off.

A few seconds later, the silence is broken...

Ryouko says: "That has to be the largest bunch of bullshit I've ever heard." Now 
she is approached yet again. "Well bitch, ready to
die? You're about to get an ass kicking from the l33test Metalhead in the 
universe!" brags Metalhead Tenchi. "Fuck off, I'm gonna be
the winner, and you'll regret betraying my love for you!!"

End of Chapter One...
