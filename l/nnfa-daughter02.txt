           NO NEED FOR A DAUGHTER: PART TWO
                    Patrina Sampath

"Now, Ryoko please explain to me WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS GOING ON!?!?!?!?" Washu exclaimed.
"Uh, nothing is going on Washu, we were just playing
around," Ryoko calmly said as she glanced over at
Ayeka.
"Really?" Washu asked as she steeped toward Ayeka..her
eyes fixed on hers, hatred burning fiercly in them.
"That's right Miss Wa--" Ayeka started to say but
before she could finish Washu's right hand came across
her left cheek. Crying out Ayeka grabbed her face as she
was knocked to the floor.
"Ayeka!!!" Ryoko screamed as she rushed to the aid of Ayeka,
"Are you ok?" she asked as she helped Ayeka off the floor.
"I..I'm alright..." Ayeka responded. Ryoko quickly
straightned up her eyes fixated on Washu's..anger
exploding in them.
"Give me one good reason I shouldn't blast you away" Ryoko
said through clenched teeth, energy balls were forming in her
hands.
"No! Ryoko don't," Ayeka quickly got up and gently pulled
Ryoko's hand, blood trickled from the side of her mouth where
Washu had hit her. Slowly the energy balls vanished and Ryoko
turned to Ayeka.
"Oh God, your bleeding," she said as she tore a piece of her
clothing off and wiped the blood away.
"I..I'm sorry Ayeka," Washu murmured, her eyes downcast.
Ryoko spun around and grabbed Washu by the front of her kimono.
"If you EVER lay a hand on her again...I SWEAR I'LL......"
Again Ayeka stepped foward and stopped Ryoko from doing something
stupid.
"Ryoko it's ok," she then turned to Washu, "I forgive you Washu,
I just don't see why you're acting like this. What is wrong with
Ryoko and I feeling and expressing our love for eachother? Tell
me so I can understand." Washu drooped her head down and sighed
heavily, all these emotions were flooding her insides Washu the
Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe was confused!!
"I just don't want Ryoko to go through the same heartbreak I went
through," Washu whispered, " I've been down that curved path and
it brought me nothing but pain and misery." Ryoko looked at Aeka
and then back at Washu.
"You mean you've done it to a woman!?! " Washu rolled her eyes
and nodded her head."AHHH!! So did you go down on her??" Ryoko
asked with a sly grin on her face.
"Hey shut up!!" Ayeka said as she slapped Ryoko on her arm.
"OW!! that hurt!!" Ryoko grabbed her arm and gave Ayeka a pouty face.
"Well to make a long story short..I fell in love with another woman
and paid the price." Washu said.
'Miss washu there has got to be more to than that," Ayeka said.
"Yeah Washu tell us all the details..especially the dirty, nasty,
juicy ones," Ryoko made faces as a rush of images appeared in her mind.
"Get your mind out of the gutter Ryoko!!," Aeka smacked Ryoko on the
arm again this time a bit harder.
"Hey you keep that up and you'll be sleeping alone tonight." Ryoko
glared at Ayeka.
"ANYWAY!!!" Washu continued, "well it wasn't an experience i'd want to
relive. I mean making love to her was good, just I don't like emotional
baggage. I know I'm generally an understandable person but, Ryoko I don't
want you feeling that kind of pain."
"Hah! I can handle anything that comes my way!!"
"Yeah right, you can't even handle me in bed," Ayeka said.
"Uh....i..uh.." Ryoko turned crimson as Washu tried unsuccessfully to
stifle a giggle. "I can handle you perfectly fine in bed Ayeka! Washu, get
back to your story."
Washu looked at both of them and smiled inwardly. This is just how Sachi
and I used to be, she thought to herself.
"Well , it all happened while I was a teenager, I was working on an
experiment at the time and I had finally completed it, I was happy so i
decided to celebrate. I walked over to friend's house and invited her
over to celebrate with me. We got drunk and things happened, when we woke
up in the morning..sober... we decided that it was just a one time thing.
Days went by before we saw eachother again, she finally came over to talk
to me about what happened and suddenly we were making love. I think I
fell in love with her that day not knowing it, our affair lasted for about
8 months before she called it quits," A tear creeped out of the corner of
Washu's left eye. Ryoko and Ayeka stood there speechless as Washu silently
weeped. "Please leave me alone," Washu turned around walked into the
darkness of her lab.
**************************SIX DAYS LATER**********************************
"Ryoko, I'm worried about Miss Washu,"
"Could we talk about this....another time, I'm trying to make love to you."
Ryoko said as she continued kissing Ayeka's neck.
"No Ryoko I'm really worried about her she hasn't come out of her lab in
six, maybe seven days!" Ayeka gently pushed Ryoko off of her and got up off
the blanket she had spread on the grass in front of the lake. "I think
i'm gonna talk to her, she needs someone to talk to. Us being together
is bringing back some hurtful memories she's tried to lock away forever."
"It seems like you care for her more than you care for me!" Feeling
dejected Ryoko angrily got up and turned her back to Ayeka, "fine I don't
care, go if you want. Just remember I won't be here if you come back!"
"Ryoko I didn't mean-" Ayeka was to late Ryoko had already phased out, "I
swear, that woman!!" yAeka picked up the blanket, folded it and headed off
towards the house. When she reached the house Kiyone almost knocked her
over.
"Oh, jeeze, sorry Princess." she said.
"No, it's alright," Ayeka politely responded even though she was a bit
annoyed. Seeing that Kiyone was a bit out of breath she asked,"Is anything
the matter Kiyone?"
"Nope, just getting some exercise that's all,"
"Ah, I see, it's good to keep in shape." Ayeka said.
"Yep, say Ayeka what's the blanket for?" Kiyone peered at the blanket with
curiosity.
"I..uh...umm...just enjoying the beautiful day under a tree that all," Ayeka
shuffled her feet, "I must be going now..don't exercise to hard now,
Kiyone."
She quickly walked away from Kiyone leaving her bewildered.
"Uh, yeah, ok," mumbled Kiyone as she continued on her run.
"Now, time to see Washu," Ayeka said. She freshened up a bit and headed off
towards Washu's lab. Cautiously she opened the door to the lab and peered
in.
She saw nothing except darkness, "Miss Washu!!, Hello!?!," Ayeka called out
but she got no response except her own voice echoing back to her. She slowly
stepped in and shut the door behind her, the hairs on the back of her neck
rose and she shivered. The darkness of the lab had swallowed her whole
leaving
her a bit frightned. "Miss Washu!" Ayeka called out again, still no
response.
Aeka looked around in the darkness waiting for her eyes to get adjusted.
Suddenly a light appeared in front of her, it wasn't a bright light. It was
a soft glow about one hundred feet from her. She walked towards it as an
uneasy feeling washed over her. As she approached it she saw a figure laying
next to it, "Washu is that you?"
"Ugh...."
'Oh my god Washu! Are you ok?" Ayeka ran towards the Scientist and knelt
down next her, Washu looked up at the Princess with a tear stained face.
"I..don't want to remember anymore," Washu said as she broke down in sobs,
"I don't want this pain...i just can't....."
Ayeka drew the broken down Scientist in her arms and hugged her tightly,
"It's ok Washu, whatever it is I'll help you through it." Ayeka looked into
the watery eyes of Washu, her own becoming the same way. She quickly brushed
them away.
"Why are you crying?" Washu asked.
"I..I'm not too sure," Ayeka looked away, "I just don't like seeing you
hurting,
that's all." Washu reached up and wiped a tear off Ayeka's cheek with her
thumb. With the same thumb she traced Ayeka's jaw bone down to her chin,
and over her soft lips. Ayeka knew where this was going, and even though
she knew she shouldn't, she continued. Ayeka closed her eyes as Washu's lips
met hers, at the same time she felt a sudden weight change in Washu. When
she opened her eye's Washu was in adult form. Again they kissed but this
time more deeply, Washu had opened her mouth slightly and Aeka took
advantage
of this. She slid her tongue inside Washu's mouth exploring, tasting,
devouring, suddenly Washu pulled away, breaking the kiss.
'What's wrong?" Ayeka looked at Washu.
'I..can't..I still..I love Sachi," The two women rose to their feet and
looked
at eachother, both were breathing heavily and clearly still turned on.
"I understand Washu, I'm sorry for..." Before she could finish Washu had
covered Ayeka's mouth with her own. Again they embraced eachother in a lock
of passion, they could feel the heat rising off of eachother. Ayeka moved
down Washu's neck kissing every inch of skin she came in contact with.
Washu moaned as she gave into her desires.
"I..I..need you," she whispered as she hungrily pulled at Ayeka's clothing.
In a matter of seconds they were both nude facing eachother, their hands
roaming eachother's body. Slowly they sunk to the floor wrapped up in
eachother's arms. Ayeka kissed the valley between Washu's breasts and then
she moved her mouth over Washu's left breast. Softly she sucked on Washu's
nipple letting her tongue flicker on it every so often. Washu's hands were
buried in Ayeka's hair,the things Ayeka's was doing to her was absolutely
blowing her mind. She shut her eyes tightly as Ayeka moved futher downward,
Ayeka paused at Washu's bellybutton using her tongue she tickled the inside
of it. Washu arched her back slightly, a soft moan escaping her mouth.
After teasing Washu for a few more seconds Ayeka decided it was time to
move on, her tongue parted Washu's nether region and tasted her sweetness.
"Ahhh," Washu whispered, she could feel Ayeka's tongue tickling her, the
ache in her lower belly was now stronger than ever, it was almost hurting
but in a good way. After a few minutes Washu began feeling as if she would
explode, the feeling became almost unbearable, "Oh god Ayeka don't stop!!,"
she cried out. She arched her back up higher, she pushed Ayeka's down on her
harder. Her whole body tensed up as she began to shake, a wave of emotion
to powerful to describe washed over her. She bit her bottom lip as she hit
her peak, Ayeka felt the warm flow of Washu's juice come out, she quickly
lapped it up causing another spasm from Washu. Finally Washu's orgasm
subsided, she pulled Ayeka ontop of her and they layed together for a
long while just listening to eachother breathing.
"What about Ryoko?" Ayeka asked breaking the silence.
"You two will go on loving eachother, and this moment we had together
will never happen again," Washu closed her eyes and sighed heavily. Ayeka
kissed Washu once more and slowly got up off of her.
"Are we going to tell her?" Aeka was fumbling around in the dark looking
for her clothes, "some light please Washu."
'Oh, yeah, sorry," the lab slowly became brighter, in silence again both
women put the rest of their clothing on.
"You didn't answer my question Washu. Are we going to tell Ryoko?" Ayeka
looked at the Scientist with a worried look on her face
"She already knows," Washu mumbled. Ayeka stopped and stared at Washu in
disbelief.
"Ex..excuse me?" she stuttered.
"Well, she doesn't know, but she knows," Ayeka gave Washu a confused look,
"ok well you know that Ryoko and I are linked together, well when you were
making love to me I let down the wall that I had built around my mind
so she couldn't read it." Ayeka paused for a minute to let what Washu
had said sink in.
"So what you're saying is that she could have read your mind?"
"Exactly," Washu responded.
"So what do we do?"
"I think we should wait and see if she knows anything," Washu went to her
floating computer and punched a few buttons. A screen in front of her
appeared showing Ryoko she was sitting outside on the tree branch where
she and Ayeka had been earlier on.
"What is she doing?" Washu asked.
**********************************2 DAYS LATER***************************
Ayeka was sitting in her room thinking about what had happened between
her and Washu, she felt an extreme amount of guilt for what happened.
Ryoko had to know what happened, because she had been avoiding Ayeka since
the incident happened. All these thoughts ran through Ayeka's head, the
guilt was killing her inside. Finally she decided it was time to do
something
about it. It took her two and half hours to find Ryoko, she was sitting
beneath
the tree lost in her own thoughts.
"Ryoko I need to talk to you now," she said quickly.
"Ahh!! Jeez, Princess don't you know better than to sneak on people like
that?"
Ryoko got up off the ground and dusted her self off.
"I'm sorry Ryoko I didn't mean to..truly I am," Ayeka walked up to Ryoko and
attempted to help her dust herself off, instead Ryoko pulled away from her.
"I can do this by myself I am capable," Ryoko snapped.
"I..I...was trying to help," Ayeka stepped back, she was hurt by Ryoko's
tone of voice. The tears that filled her eyes were quickly brushed away,
"Ryoko I need to talk to you now." Ryoko looked at Ayeka and decided
to listen to her.
"Fine, talk."
"First I want to say that, no matter what happens I will always love you,
and that everyone makes mistakes," Ayeka finished talking waiting for
a response from Ryoko but none came. " You don't have to be so cold,
say something to me!" Ayeka said raising her voice.
"Washu...." Ryoko whispered. An astonished look came over Ayeka's face, she
was hoping Ryoko didn't know.
"What about Washu?" Ayeka asked playing dumb.
"You...she was with you...how could you?" Ryoko's fists curled up into balls
as she face was twisted into an furious expression.
"I--" Ayeka started to say but Ryoko cut her off.
"How could she?!?" Ryoko stared at Ayeka the hurt she felt was instantly
turned into rage. " I have played for a fool, how long has it been going
on Ayeka huh? How long have you been betraying me?!?!" I should have known
sooner. Washu is going to pay severly!!" Ryoko let out a scream before
phasing out.
"Noo! Ryoko wait!" Again Ayeka's words fell on deaf ears. She buried her
face in her hands and wept, everything had gone so terribly wrong.
Suddenly she stopped crying, "Oh, no...Washu!" She quickly ran to the house.
When she reached the house she bumped into Kiyone again this time knocking
her over.
"Hey!"Kiyone shouted as she fell hard on her butt.
"Oh deeply sorry Kiyone," apologized Ayeka as she helped Kiyone up.
"Oh god, first Ryoko storms in here mad as hell almost killing us all and
now you..knocking me on my ass!! What the hell is going on?!?" Kiyone rubbed
her probably bruised rear end.
"I have no time to explain Kiyone," Aeka turned and started on her way.
"No, I want answers now," Kiyone said grabbing Ayeka by the shoulder.
"Ok you want to know fine I'll tell you," Ayeka took a deep breath and
blurted out, "Ryoko is gonna kill Washu because I cheated on her and slept
with Washu!" Having said that the Princess pried Kiyone's hand off her
shoulder
and hurried off to Washu's lab. Kiyone stood where she was a shocked look
was
frozen on her face.
"Yeah right, what does that princess take me for a fool? She's just
kidding....
I hope."  Kiyone rubbed her rear end again and cursed, "this house is
getting
to weird for me."
Ayeka rushed into Washu's lab hoping nothing bad had happened.
"WHY HER? I LOVED HER!!" Aeka heard Ryoko scream, she quickly rushed in the
direction of Ryoko's voice. Finally she came to the spot where Ryoko had
her energy sword to Washu's neck.
"Ryoko no!" Ayeka screamed as she rushed forward to Ryoko.
"Stay back before I hurt you Ayeka, " Ryoko gave Ayeka a menacing that
caused Ayeka to stop abruptly.
"Ryoko please don't do anything," Ayeka pleaded, her eyes filling up with
tears
again, "Washu didn't do anything I was the one! Please don't hurt her!"
Ryoko turned to Ayeka the energy sword diminished but the anger was still
in her eyes, she began to walk towards Ayeka.
"So Miss Ayeka how was she? Did you enjoy sleeping with my mother?!?
Did the thought of betraying me excite you, huh?" Ryoko was now about one
foot away from Ayeka, "everything you ever told me was a lie." Ryoko's
left hand came up and backhanded Ayeka. Ayeka staggered back and brought
her hand up to her face, blood trickled from the side of her mouth.
"I still love you Ryoko!" Ayeka shouted.
"You lie!!" Ryoko came up and smacked Ayeka again this time knocking her
backward a few feet.
"Ryoko stop this insanity right now!" Washu finally spoke up.
"So my mother the whore finally decideds to speak," Ryoko turned her
attention back to her mother.
"Ryoko, it was a one time thing. I don't love Ayeka and she doesn't love
me. It was something that happened in the heat of the moment! Please
listen to me." Washu pleaded, but Ryoko seemed not to hear any of it.
"I'm going to make sure it won't happen again," Ryoko formed her energy
sword in her hand again.
With her head still sinning from Ryoko's slap Ayeka slowly got up, she
licked the corner of her mouth and flinched. When she looked up she saw
Ryoko advancing on Washu.
"Oh, god no," She whispered as she quickly got up and ran towards them.
"Good bye Washu," Ryoko said as she plunged the sword into Washu's stomach.
But the scream she heard wasn't Washu's. Ryoko looked over to her right and
Washu on the floor with a horrified look on her face. Ryoko looked into the
ruby eyes of Ayeka, she gasped as she realized what she had done. "Oh, no
Oh, please god no, I didn't..I...I.." Ryoko let her sword disappear, Ayeka
slumped into her, Ryoko held onto Ayeka and slowly sunk to the floor.
'Oh god..what have I done?" Ryoko turned to Washu, "Do something please
help her...don't let her die Washu...don't...I..what did I do?" Ryoko felt
Ayeka's warm blood flow over her fingers. "No don't die, Ayeka..I..love
you..please don't die..I love you, do you hear me?..I'm sorry..I'm sorry,
just don't die on me..please..no," Ryoko cradled Ayeka as Washu quickly
pushed buttons on her computer.
"Ryo..Ryoko..." Ayeka struggled to say.
"Oh god Ayeka you..you're alive..I..I.."
"Ryoko, I..I love you...i..forgive..yo..." Ayeka brought her hand up and
touched Ryoko's cheek leaving a streak of her blood as her arm fell and she
closed her eyes once more.
"Ayeka?..Ayeka?!? Open your eyes hun..please!" Ryoko gently shook Ayeka
hoping to get a response, but none came.....
'AYEKA!?! AYEKA!!!...OH GOD NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" Ryoko screamed, tears running
down her face...
