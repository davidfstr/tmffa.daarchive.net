    "Nooo! Mihoshi!" Tenchi screamed as Ayeka stabbed the sword into
Mihoshi's head. Fortunately for Mihoshi, she ducked just in time and the
sword made a very large hole in the wall.
    "Ayeka!" Mihoshi said. "Stop! You're ruining Tenchi's walls!"
    Pulling the sword out of the wall, Tenchi pointed it at Ayeka.
    "Now now Tenchi!" she said. You don't want to hurt your wife..." Tenchi
locked her up in the linen closet and through away the key.
    They went to bed together.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    The next day, Tenchi went to talk to his dad.
    He knocked on the door. "Dad?"
    "Come in son."
    "Dad... I just asked Mihoshi to marry me."
    "Oh, Tenchi!!!! I'm so proud of you!!!"
    "Yea... so what do I do tonight?"
    "You have sex."
    Tenchi looked horrified. "Dad!"
    "What? All women like it. Besides, it's a tradition to do it the day you
propose."
    Tenchi gulped. "Ok dad..."

 *~*~*~*~*MENWHILE: Mihoshi is getting some advise from Ryoko*~*~*~*~*

    "So, Tenchi finally asked you to marry him?" Ryoko said.
    "You- you're not mad?"
    "No! If it was Ayeka, then yes, I would be mad. But it was so obvious he
liked you..."
    "So, What should I do? What should I say? What should I wear? What
should
I -"
    "Mihoshi! Mihoshi! Calm down! Tonight, you HAVE to make out with him."
    "Make out?" Mihoshi looked confused.
    "You know... have sex. All men love it. And you have to... um... let
him... you know... insert it." Ryoko said.
    "Insert it? Insert what? Insert it where?"
    Ryoko fell down. "You know! Park the car in the garage, put the stick in
the hole...?"
    Mihoshi's confused look only got worse.
    "MIHOSHI! You have to let him stick his... um... bread... in the
oven..."
    "Oh! There's bread in the oven?" Mihoshi asked hopefully.
    "MIHOSHI! You have to let him stick his thing in yours."
    "Oh, I get it!" Her smile quickly disappeared. Blushing, she looked at
the ground. "Will it hurt?"
    "Mihoshi, you are such a baby! Well... maybe at first, but then it'll
get
real good!"
    "Ok, Ryoko..." Mihoshi said, sounding alot more confedent then she felt.
 *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

    That night, Mihoshi told Kiyone she would be sleeping with Tenchi. So,
tip toeing down the hall, she knocked on Tenchi's door. "Come in!" Tenchi
called.
    Ryoko, listening from the room next door, thought to her self, "Let the
games begin!"
