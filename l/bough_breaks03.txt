********Well, here we are at Chapter Three.  I can't tell you all how grateful I 
am for your positive comments on this one.  By now you all should realize that 
I'm trying to do for Mihoshi with this fic what Happosai did for Ryoko with 
"Aikan Muyo."  I set the bar high for a reason, and I hope to surmount it.  Fan 
fiction is a funny thing; so often I have found myself unable to continue 
because I did not want to hurt the characters.  I honestly felt bad when I put 
them in a situation that endangered them or their relationships.  Such is the 
case here, but this time, I will continue.  Be warned: this *will* disturb you.  
And, as always, Mihoshi, Tenchi, and related friends and family belong to *our* 
friends and esteemed colleagues at AIC and Pioneer.  Now read.***********

*********Oh, BTW, the timeframe for this fic is sometime soon after Season 2 of 
the OAV, but before MNE (even though it isn't part of the OAV continuity, it 
might as well be).  Heh, I probably should have told all of you that in Chapter 
One. ^_^************

	"I've been lonely
	I've been waiting for you
	I'm pretending and that's all I can do
	The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart
	You've been hiding, never letting it show
	Always trying to keep it under control
	You got it down, and you're well on your way to the top
	But there's something that you forgot
	What about love?"

	"Ryoko!" Tenchi gasped.

	"Tenchi, how could you, you...little bastard!  I can't believe you would 
do that with *her*!  Why, Tenchi...WHY!?  
You...little...bastard...Tenchi...Tenchi...why..." Ryoko sputtered as she slowly 
backed away from him, eventually coming to rest on the wall.  She hunched her 
shoulders and folded her arms across her chest, which heaved with indescribably 
painful sobs.  She continued to mutter obscenities between the sobs.

	Gallons of adrenaline emptied into Tenchi's veins as he instantly snapped 
himself out of his stupor.  No!  It had happened!  Ryoko had heard!  Damn it, 
NO!  Tenchi's mind screamed at him.  Tenchi stared dumbfounded at the floor, 
wishing at the moment that he could become one of the many wood boards that 
composed it.  Anything to take him away from the pain he was feeling.  Anything 
to remove him from this situation.  Anything to reverse what he did.  And he 
knew exactly what he had done.  He had broken Ryoko's trust in him.  He also 
knew that he would be punished for it.  That fact blazed through his mind as he 
desperately searched for something to say to the demon that would help her 
understand.  This wasn't going to be easy, not by any stretch of the 
imagination.

	"Ryoko...you, you heard us?  So, so you know what happened?"  He began, 
weakly.

	Her sobs diminished, and Ryoko roughly wiped away her tears with her arm.  
She remained stoicly posed against the wall, her body slightly shaking, her eyes 
staring straight ahead.  

	"I did more than *hear* you two.  I *saw* everything.  I *saw* you 
grabbing at her tits, and I *saw* you grope her cunt.  Oh, yes, I *saw* it all.  
And, trust me, Tenchi, I will kill that little fucking twat for forcing herself 
on you.  Oh yes, you can *count on me* for *that*."  Ryoko spat out in a 
sarcastic tone.  Tenchi froze.  Her voice was dead serious, level and calm.  She 
had never heard her like this before.  It chilled him right to his core.  But he 
wouldn't let Mihoshi be the victim of his mistake.

	"No, Ryoko, it wasn't her fault!  She had nothing to do with what 
happened!  It's...it's my fault, Ryoko.  I did it, I did it all.  I'm very 
sorry."  He saw no response from Ryoko.  "Please, Ryoko, listen!  Mihoshi's 
grandfather died today!  She needed to be...well, comforted.  I can't tell you 
how sorry I am for letting it get out of hand."

	"I don't care.  I don't care if that whole stupid bitch's family dies!  I 
know she made you do it, Tenchi.  I know she made you fuck her.  So how was she, 
Tenchi?  How was it like to fuck a stupid blonde idiot like her?  Was she good?  
Better than I could ever be?"  Ryoko fumed, seemingly oblivious to Tenchi as she 
talked to the wall in front of her, unable to even face him.

	Tenchi suddenly stood up.  "Stop it, Ryoko!  Stop it right now!," he 
yelled at her.  Ryoko gasped and turned towards him.  "Listen, Ryoko, we didn't 
do anything!  Mihoshi didn't force herself on me, and we didn't have sex!"  The 
frustration left his voice as he continued, replaced by a pleading tone.  "I had 
just come upstairs to brush my teeth, and Mihoshi told me that her grandfather, 
the Marshal of the Galaxy Police, had died.  She was crying, Ryoko, just like 
you did.  What was I supposed to do, leave her lying on the floor?  Do you think 
I would do that to *you?*"

	Ryoko furrowed her brow and looked down at the floor.  She paused a moment 
before continuing.  "Tenchi, I risked my life for you.  I would walk through 
fire for you, you know that.  I would *kill* for you, Tenchi.  But I know what I 
saw.  Don't tell me what I saw, Tenchi.  I know you too well for that.  But..."

	"But what, Ryoko?"

	"But you've also never lied to me.  You've always given me a straight 
answer.  But I also don't know if I can trust you anymore.  You were supposed to 
love me, and only me.  We were supposed to share something special 
together...just you and me, no one else.  Dammit...it was only supposed to be 
you and me...forever..."  Her voice trailed off.

	"Life doesn't always turn out how you like it, Ryoko.  Sometimes it really 
stinks.  But please, Ryoko, give me a break.  I'm still a teenager.  I'm very 
sorry, Ryoko, but really, there's no need for you to be so selfish about keeping 
me for yourself.  And don't blame it on Mihoshi.  It's not her fault," Tenchi 
said quietly.  Ryoko still kept silent.  Suddenly, however, Tenchi realized 
something.  He walked over and gently planted a hand on Ryoko's shoulder.  Ryoko 
looked up at him, her eyes brimming with more tears.  "Ryoko?"

	"What?"

	"How much did you see?  When did you come in?"

	The pirate thought for a moment, the memory obviously paining her as she 
grimaced, recalling the event.  "It was just after you started...ugh, stroking 
her.  I heard something going on up here, so I floated up through the floor and 
saw you two.  Then I floated up to the rafters and watched as...as she..."

	"It's okay, you don't have to continue.  So why didn't you stop us?," 
Tenchi added thoughtfully.

	"Christ Tenchi, maybe it was because I was in *shock.*  I've never known 
you to act like that.  So I left after she...climbed...on top of you."  Ryoko's 
voice hardened some.  "It was...almost more than I could take."

	"Then you didn't see what happened after.  Ryoko, after you left, she got 
another call from her commander.  We talked some, and then she fell asleep.  We 
didn't do it, Ryoko.  We just didn't.  I may have done some things, but not any 
more than I would have done if it were you who was in pain.  Please believe me, 
Ryoko."  He took her hands in his.

	For a moment, it seemed as if she would agree with him.  Her eyes widened 
some as she considered his words.  Just then, however, Ryoko's eyes narrowed, 
she pulled her hands out from Tenchi's, and turned her back to him.  

	"I wish I could, Tenchi, I wish I could."  Without another word, Ryoko 
vanished into the moonbeam, leaving Tenchi standing defeated in the hallway.

	"Damn."  This was the last word Tenchi said before he slumped into his 
room, dropped onto his bed, and fell asleep.

*****************************************************************

	The sun greeted the Masaki house, as it did every morning.  Golden rays 
poked under the shade in Tenchi's room and slowly spread across his face.  He 
groggily opened his eyes, and the entire contents of the night before came 
flooding back to his consciousness in an instant.  Mere moments after he had 
awakened, Tenchi felt his stomach twist as he balked at the idea of facing the 
day ahead.  He raised his hand to his forehead and wiped it down the length of 
his face.

	"Why does this always have to happen to me?" he mumbled through his hand.  
He turned to look at his clock.  It read 5:13.  Too early to get up, but too 
late to go back to sleep.  Why did Ryoko have to be so...impossible?  "I'm only 
human," he thought as he reached over and turned off his alarm.  Then he 
remembered what Ryoko had told him.

	"Trust me, Tenchi, I will kill that little fucking twat for forcing 
herself on you.  I will kill...I will kill...I will kill..."

	At that moment, Tenchi sprang from his bed, flung open his door, and ran 
down the hallway.  

	"She couldn't have...she wouldn't have...there's no way..."  He finally 
reached Mihoshi's door and pulled it open.  In the dim morning light, he could 
make out her figure, curled up under her blanket, just as he had left her.  
Tenchi held his breath and listened for hers.  After a moment, he heard it.  He 
looked carefully, and saw her form rise and fall with each breath.  Tenchi 
breathed a sigh of relief, and slowly slid her door shut.  He silently said a 
prayer for Mihoshi, and thanked Ryoko in his mind for her action, or rather, 
inaction.  Either way, it was time for breakfast.

	"I wonder if Sasami is up yet...it's pretty early, even for her," Tenchi 
said to himself while walking past Aeka and Sasami's room.  He crept up to their 
door and put his ear to it.  He heard someone's breathing, but he couldn't be 
sure whose it was.  While he listened in the fresh stillness of the morning, the 
scent of fried tofu wafted up to his nose.  "Ah, there we go.  Wow...she is up.  
Sasami doesn't usually get up until 6:00 or so."  Suddenly feeling sharp hunger 
pangs, Tenchi decided to get an early start on breakfast, and started 
downstairs.  He came to a halt on the stairs when he heard a door opening behind 
him.

	"Lord Tenchi...," Aeka said as she poked her head out of the darkness of 
her doorway.

	Tenchi turned about to look at her.  "Oh, Miss Aeka, you *are* awake.  
Wow, you're up as early as Sasami this morning.  Did you sleep well?"  He then 
noticed Aeka was shaking slightly, and appeared on the verge of collapse.  "Um, 
Aeka...is everything okay?"

	"Everything's fine, Tenchi...I slept fine.  But...Tenchi I...if you do not 
mind, I won't be joining you for breakfast."  Her voice seemed unsure and far-
away.

	"Oh...all right.  If you change your mind, I can bring some up to..."

	"No, Lord Tenchi.  I am fine.  Thank you," she replied, rather more firm 
than usual.  With that, Aeka retreated back into her room and shut the door.  
Tenchi knew something was amiss, yet he tried as hard as he could to shut out 
what he thought it was.  It was definitely a possibility, but he just didn't 
want to believe it.  

	"Not again," he thought.  "No, I'm just imagining things.  You know how 
women are, Tenchi.  Always moody."  He managed to chuckle to himself a bit, his 
mind trying to stifle the doubt he felt.  He felt the pangs again, and decided 
he'd waited long enough for food.  Yes, food.  That would shut out his doubts 
for at least a half hour or so.  Then at least he'd have school to mull over his 
problems without being constantly reminded of them.

	As he reached the bottom of the stairs, he saw an unusual sight, even for 
his household.  Sasami was sitting at the dining table.  She remained 
motionless, her head bowed slightly, as Tenchi approached her.

	"Sasami?"

	The princess jumped slightly, and picked up her head for a moment.  "Oh, 
Tenchi, it's you."  She lowered her head again, and averted her eyes from him.

	"Sasami, is there anything wrong?  You always make breakfast."

	"Yeah, I didn't feel much like it this morning.  Miss Washu is making it 
today," she replied in monotone.  Again Tenchi felt doubt rising in him.  This 
was just too strange.

	"Heh, heh.  Washu, huh?  Well, I don't think she'll do as good as you, 
Sasami."  Tenchi rubbed the back of his head and smiled at her.  Sasami remained 
still and didn't reply, keeping her eyes focused on the view outside.  "Well, I 
guess...I'll go see how she's doing," Tenchi said uneasily after a few moments, 
and started walking towards the kitchen.

	Washu, busy at the cooktop, heard Tenchi enter, but did not turn around to 
see him.  She hummed quietly to herself as she briskly stirred around the tofu 
that was indeed cooking on the stove.  As she was stirring, the timer on the 
steamer "dinged," and she lifted up the top, pulled out the basket, and poured 
the summer squash into the colander in the sink.

	"Wow, Little Washu, that smells good!  I guess I underestimated your 
talents!" Tenchi said as he sniffed the blend of aromas coming from the stove.

	"Oh, hi Tenchi!  Yep, you can never underestimate a genius like me!  I can 
bring home the bacon *and* fry it up in a pan, too!  Here, help me."  With that, 
Washu turned around and tossed two raw eggs at him, which Tenchi barely managed 
to catch without breaking.

	"Wa-Washu?  Wha-?"  Tenchi stared dumbfounded at her.

	"Scramble those for me.  What, you thought you could come in and say 'hi' 
without being put to manual labor?  Shame on you Tenchi, you should know better 
by now.  Those are your eggs, and that over there is the bowl.  Now get 
cracking."

	Tenchi did as he was told, breaking the eggs into a bowl and whipping them 
into a froth with a fork.  Washu resumed her preparation, and Tenchi noticed her 
humming.  "Wow, Washu, you seem chipper this morning.  What has you so happy?"

	"Oh, nothing much, recalibrated the orbits of a few moons in the Antares 
cluster, set up a Shofixti breeding colony on Vulpes 9...you know they breed 
like rabbits, or cabbits, for that matter.  Why do you ask?"

	"It's...it's just that Aeka and Sasami seem so...distant...this morning.  
I don't know, maybe it's nothing, but it has me worried."

	Washu paused in her task, turned and looked hard at Tenchi.  

	"I don't know, Tenchi, I really don't.  Sasami knocked on my door about a 
half an hour ago and asked if I would make breakfast for her.  She seemed 
troubled by something, but I didn't ask what.  My advice to you would be to talk 
to her, and see if you can find out what is going on.  Because if there's one 
thing I've learned in all my time here, it's that most of the problems in this 
house usually revolve around you.  I'm not saying that it's always your fault, 
Tenchi, but this time, it will be if you don't do something about it."

	The scientist's clairvoyance was shocking.  Did she know what happened, 
too?  But how could she...Washu was in her lab all last night, just like she 
usually is, and...WAIT!  Tenchi's jaw dropped open, and an egg he had been 
holding fell to the floor and broke.  His mind screamed an answer at him, in the 
form of a memory that he had overlooked.

***************************************************************

	"Just as you are connected with Ryo-ohki, so am I connected with you, my 
dear.  So I know...everything.

	"So I know...everything...everything...everything..."

***************************************************************

	Washu and Ryoko share a mental bond!

	"You...you know, don't you...," he stammered.

	Washu nodded.  "I don't know exactly, Tenchi, but I do know that Ryoko is 
in an awful amount of anguish right now.  My link with Ryoko isn't total, I 
can't exactly read her thoughts, but what I can sense is her general emotional 
state.  And right now, it couldn't be more tumultuous.  I can sense that she's 
torn between feeling sorry for herself, and anger."

	"Anger?  Towards who?"

	Washu grabbed a sponge, knelt down, and began wiping up the smashed egg on 
the tile floor.  She didn't answer for a moment, then, looking up at Tenchi, 
said, "I think you know the answer to that question better than I do, Tenchi.  
Here, get down here with me for a second."

	Tenchi knelt down as well, facing Washu.  "What is it?"

	"Look at this egg, Tenchi.  It's smashed, right?  Well, that was because a 
tremendous amount of pressure was applied to it at one point only.  It was only 
for a moment, but the pressure produced was immense enough to destroy it.  
However...," she reached up and grabbed another egg on the counter.  She gripped 
it in her hand and squeezed it.  "If you apply equal amounts of pressure to all 
sides, the egg stays whole, almost as if there was no pressure at all.  Now, 
this egg also used to be the beginnings of a chicken, in embryonic state, right?  
Well, if someone had not intervened, this egg would have grown up into a mature 
chicken, ready to lay her own eggs.  But someone *did* intervene, and took this 
egg from its mother prematurely, in order to make us breakfast.  And look how it 
ended up.  Smashed.  Sort of like that lullaby that goes, 'Rock-a-bye baby, on 
the tree top, when the wind blows, the cradle will rock, when the bough breaks, 
the cradle will fall...'"

	Tenchi, finally catching on to her point, finished, "And down will come 
baby, cradle and all."  He bowed his head for a moment, then stood up quickly.  
"Where's Ryoko, Washu?"

	Washu finished wiping up the egg, then stood up as well.  "She's down by 
the lake.  Been there since sometime last night, from what I could tell."

	Without another word, Tenchi rushed out the door.  As he was halfway 
outside, Washu called to him, "Hey, Tenchi!  Aren't you going to help me?  This 
isn't easy, you know!"  But he was already gone by the time she finished.  
"Damn.  I don't know how Sasami does this every morning.  Oh well, I guess even 
genius scientists need to pitch in once in awhile," she added to herself, and 
resumed cooking.

*********************************************************************

	One lone figure sat motionless on a fallen log, watching the golden rays 
of the sun perform a ballet of light upon the trembling surface of the lake.  
Birds skimmed the surface for fish, their calls somewhat muffled by the distant 
splashing of the onsen's waterfalls.  All Ryoko did was watch them, diving and 
twisting in the air just above the water.  She had long since stopped crying, 
but let the tears that had run down her face dry on her skin.  Her hair had been 
thoroughly knotted from pulling at it so much, and her back was stiff from 
sitting in one position for so long.  But it had been a short night, oh yes it 
had.  Her mind had been far too preoccupied with the stuff that filled it now to 
think much about time.  

	"Hmm...stuff.  Yeah, Ryoko, that's what it seems like.  Shapeless, 
formless stuff, so much of it that I haven't been able to move from this spot 
all night," she thought.  "This is stupid.  This is so goddamn stupid, sitting 
here moping.  This isn't me.  Now it's getting light out, and I haven't done a 
damned thing all night.  Maybe if I go take a bath I can clear my..."

	"Ry-o-ko!"

	"Tenchi!" the pirate gasped.  She turned quickly, and saw him coming over 
the hill.  "I can't let Tenchi see me like this," she thought.  "I look like 
garbage..."  Ryoko reached up and smoothed back her hair, trying her best to 
make it look presentable.  She reached down into an eddy of the lake, cupped 
some water in her hands, and splashed it over her face, trying to wash away the 
tears that had dried there.  After she had finished this task, she straightened 
out her dress and folded her hands into her lap, trying to appear unconcerned.  
"I'd better act like I'm still pissed at him, or he might suspect something," 
she thought.  "Here he comes..."

	Tenchi finally caught sight of his target as he crested the hill.  He 
slowed his jog down to a walk, then came to a stop just behind the log Ryoko was 
sitting on.

	"Ohayo, Ryoko," Tenchi said, slightly out of breath.

	"Hey," she replied.

	Tenchi wanted to say something else, but nothing came to him.  Noticing 
Ryoko had not looked at him yet, he waited as a few uncomfortable moments 
passed.  Tenchi and Ryoko both stared out at the water, not saying anything more 
to each other.  The birds continued to call, the water continued to splash, and 
the light ballet on the water continued unabated.  A few more moments of silence 
passed, until Tenchi broke the silence.

	"Thank you, Ryoko," Tenchi finally said.

	Ryoko definitely wasn't prepared for *that* line this morning.  She turned 
and faced Tenchi as he continued to stare at the horizon.  "F-for what?"

	"For sparing Mihoshi.  I know that you could have easily killed her last 
night, and I wouldn't have been able to stop you.  But you spared her, even 
after you said you'd kill her."

	Ryoko groaned and turned back towards the water.  "Oh, is that what you 
think?  That I'd actually kill her?  C'mon, Tenchi, you know me better than 
that.  Besides, I wouldn't...waste an energy sword on that little tramp anyway.  
She's...she's not worth it."  She dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand, 
while her mind screamed at her, "Damn it, Ryoko, just hug the poor bastard!  
Grab him and don't ever let him go again!"  But she didn't.  For the moment, 
Ryoko remained stock still, planted on the log.  Her pride wouldn't let her 
move.

	"Must have been cold out here last night, Ryoko.  You must be really 
hungry, too," Tenchi commented, a slight hint of concern entering his voice.  "I 
know I am."

	"Oh, pssh, naw, I-I've only been out here a few minutes.  I...just wanted 
to get up early to-to watch the sunrise.  Yeah, I ain't hungry, get 
lost...you...you don't know what you're talking about, Tenchi.  I'm...just...," 
she trailed off when she looked up and saw Tenchi staring at her.

	"You can't fool me, Ryoko.  Washu told me that you were out here all 
night...that you were caught between two emotions.  Well, I just wanted to come 
out here to see which one you decided on."

	Ryoko sighed.  "Oh, great.  Washu, I should have known.  She sent you out 
here, didn't she?"

	Tenchi shook his head.  "No, she didn't.  I came out here because I was 
concerned about how you were doing.  But you still haven't answered my 
question."

	Ryoko looked away.  "Well, if you mean whether I'm still mad at you or 
not, I *am.*  And I'm not ever coming back into that house, nosiree.  I'm gonna 
sit here and be mad at you forever and ever, so there.  And there's nothing you 
or anyone can...do..."  Suddenly she felt Tenchi's hand on her shoulder.  She 
gasped a bit and blushed.

	"Come on, listen to yourself, Ryoko.  Listen to what you're saying.  Do 
you really believe that?  I sure don't.  But," Tenchi sat down on the log next 
to her, "If that's the way you're going to be, I'm going to sit right down here 
with you and wait until forever is over.  To tell you the truth," he reached 
over and pulled a lock of Ryoko's cyan hair back and placed it behind her ear, 
"I think we're in for a long wait."

	Ryoko couldn't help but smile a bit at Tenchi's words, while she thought, 
"Tenchi, I would wait forever for you, even if it meant suffering the rest of my 
life because of it."  She shot a quick glance at him, then lowered her head back 
to her chest.  "All right, all right, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for being a total 
bitch."

	"That's not what I came out here for, Ryoko.  I don't want an 
apology...it's me who should apologize to you.  What I do want is for you to 
come back inside.  Just come inside and have some breakfast.  Washu really is a 
good cook, you know, almost as good as Sasami."

	Ryoko sighed again and rested her head on Tenchi's shoulder.  "So Washu's 
cooking this morning...we're in for trouble.  Mmm...but some food would be good 
right about now.  I guess I can't sit out here feeling sorry for myself 
forever."

	"So that was it?  You were out here feeling sorry for yourself?  You 
weren't angry with me?" Tenchi asked.

	"Well, I suppose I was at first, but then, after I came out here, I got 
angry with myself for leaving you like I did, and not being able to stop you 
from doing it.  But-but it just doesn't feel good when I leave you sad like 
that.  I can't...describe it, I can't even explain it, but every time I get 
upset at you, I try to stay mad at you and can't.  I always end up feeling angry 
at myself for leaving you in pain.  I just don't get it.  It's 
so...embarrassing."

	Tenchi stood up and grasped Ryoko's hands.  "Stand up, Ryoko.  Go on, 
stand up."

	Ryoko slowly began to stand, keeping her golden eyes focused on Tenchi.  
"Tenchi, wha-"

	Once Ryoko was on her feet, Tenchi pulled her into his arms and hugged 
her, holding her tightly against him.  Ryoko, completely shocked by this, made a 
feeble attempt to pull away, but Tenchi held her too tightly.  She gave in and 
slowly wrapped her arms around him.

	"See, Ryoko, I don't hate you.  I trust you, just like I trusted you last 
night.  I told you I would do this if you were in pain, just like I did with 
Mihoshi.  Please, Ryoko, trust me.  I need you back.  I need to know you forgive 
me...and Mihoshi...and yourself," Tenchi whispered into her ear, his voice 
urgent.

	"Oh, Tenchi..." The fight was completely out of Ryoko, and she closed her 
eyes and let a tear run down her cheek, relishing the first hug that she could 
remember Tenchi giving her out of his own free will.  "You dirty little boy, 
tricking me into hugging you like that.  I...am...so...mad...at...you...," she 
chuckled softly, her voice trailing off into the sounds of the birds on the 
water.

	"Come on, let's go get some breakfast.  I'm starving.  Whaddya say, it 
looks like some fried tofu and squash.  Washu's also got some eggs going."

	"Okay, okay, you talked me into it.  Let's just get out of here, I'm 
freezing my ass off."  Tenchi let Ryoko go, and they started walking back the 
way Tenchi had come, over the hill, and back to the house.  "But you do realize 
that I can't taste anything I eat," she told Tenchi as they were walking.

	Tenchi turned to her, surprised.  "Really?"

	"Oh, yeah.  Back a few months ago when I was trying to cook for you, I 
totally screwed up the recipie because I couldn't tell how much of what I was 
putting into it.  Nearly killed poor Ryo-ohki when I had her taste some."

	"So why do you get so picky over which brand of sake we get from the 
market?"

	Ryoko playfully nudged Tenchi in the side, which hurt more than he let on.  
"You silly, I don't care about the taste.  I buy the brand of sake that can get 
me the most drunk.  Hee hee, you should know that by now."

	Tenchi laughed a bit, holding his side.  "Heh, yeah, that makes sense."

	As the orange sun finally cleared the horizon entirely, the birds finished 
their early morning romp over the lake, and flew off over the treetops.  The 
sound of Ryoko and Tenchi's laughter could now be heard echoeing over the lake 
as they approached the Masaki house.

****************************************************************

	Back inside the house, Washu surveyed the spread she had completed.  Not 
nearly as spectacular as Sasami's, to be sure, but nevertheless quite an 
outstanding job.  She saw the outside door slide open, and Ryoko and Tenchi step 
back inside.

	"Ah, so there you two are!  I was beginning to wonder if you guys had 
fallen in the lake and drowned or something.  So, whaddya think?" She indicated 
the plates of food she had finished.  "Pretty good, if I do say so myself, even 
if you DID bail on helping me halfway through, Tenchi."  Washu pointed an 
accusing finger at him.

	Tenchi put his hands up in front of him.  "Er, ah, yeah Washu, I was going 
to help you just as soon as I was finished talking with Ryoko, really, heh heh."

	"Oh, so you *are* getting to be like me, huh Tenchi?  I knew it wouldn't 
take long before the ol' 'Ryoko Charm' rubbed off on you, eh?" she joked.

	Tenchi turned to her.  "Now wait just a minute Ryoko...!"

	"Sounds like you two are back to normal.  Speaking of which," Washu added 
as she piled plates, bowls and silverware into Ryoko's arms, "Here.  Take this, 
this, this and these to the table.  Like I told Tenchi, if you're gonna stay and 
chat, you're gonna do work."

	"Aww, but Mom..." Ryoko pleaded.

	"Don't 'but Mom' me.  Besides, you were the one sitting on your butt since 
yesterday, so you deserve to do some work.  Come on, get moving," Washu chided, 
shooeing Ryoko out into the dining room.  Tenchi started to follow her, but was 
stopped when Washu grabbed onto his sleeve.

	"Uh uh, not so fast.  You get to take the platters of food to the table."  
Once Ryoko was out of the room, however, Washu pulled Tenchi close to her and 
lowered her voice.  "So how'd it go?  I can sense she's a great deal more 
relaxed.  You must have said something to her."

	Tenchi lowered his to match.  "I really don't know, Washu.  I think Ryoko 
just needed to see me...I can't really explain what happened...it just kind 
of...did."

	Washu seemed surprised.  "Oh, really?  It never used to be that easy to 
calm her down.  Maybe she *is* growing up after all.  Oh, and Tenchi?"

	"Yeah?"

	"Here," she said as she placed a platter into his hands.

**********************************************************************

	The room was dark, not even lit by the sun.  All of the shades remained 
pulled, and the only sound was the breathing of one lonely woman, sitting at her 
desk, thinking.  Somehow, the darkness of her room fit her mood.  She had let 
herself out only once to use the bathroom since late last night.  All of the 
rest of the time she remained sitting in the dark.  Her sister did not need to 
hear what she did, even if she had probably heard it before in some manner or 
another.  There had been fights between Ryoko and Tenchi before, but nothing 
like *this.*  She simply couldn't believe it.  There was just no way that Tenchi 
could have done...*that* with Mihoshi.  Not when he knew that she was right next 
door, not when he *knew* the sort of trouble that it would bring.  These 
thoughts and more had occupied Princess Aeka for the entire night.  Her and 
Sasami had discussed it, and though she was never one to believe Ryoko, even 
Aeka couldn't help but give in to the possibility that, that...

	"Lord Tenchi has chosen Mihoshi over me."

	Of all people, why her?  Oh sure, Aeka had not been able to make out 
exactly what Tenchi said to Ryoko, for he was talking far too softly, but she 
had heard what the pirate had said to him.  And that was all that she needed, 
because, as much as Aeka knew Ryoko lied, there was absolutely no reason for her 
to lie this time, screaming at the top of her lungs, at 2:30 in the morning when 
she was supposed to be asleep.  But still, she had her doubts.  They were small, 
but they were there.  She had expressed those and more to Sasami last night, 
after Ryoko's screaming fit had awoken them.  But Sasami didn't quite have the 
stomach to stay up all night like her sister, and fell asleep for a few hours 
before waking up again and heading downstairs to get Washu.

	"Oh Sasami, I didn't mean to drag you into this...I wish I could be down 
there with you.  It's just that I...I just can't face Tenchi now.  What am I 
supposed to tell him?  I...can hardly stand to think about it, let alone 
confront him with it.  Oh Sasami, you're the only one I can talk to right now."  
She looked over at the cabbit, Ryo-ohki, asleep on Sasami's pillow.

	"And you're no help.  Even if I could understand what you were saying, I 
doubt you'd understand my situation anyway, Ryo-chan.  Huh, you usually wake up 
with Sasami...I guess this has her bothered more than I figured if even *you* 
are avoiding her."  She sighed.  "I suppose I can't blame her.  How could this 
happen...how could Tenchi do this to us?"

	In her frustration, Aeka reached out and gripped the edge of her desk 
tightly.  She jerked her hand back quickly, however, when she felt a sliver of 
wood enter her fingertip.  Aeka brought it up to her face and squeezed it, 
drawing a small drop of blood.  She sighed deeply and sucked the blood off her 
finger.

	"This just won't do.  I won't be able to stay up here forever.  Sometime 
I'm going to have to go downstairs to eat," she reasoned.  "Well, it might as 
well be now.  I have to clean this wound anyway...and I will not be responsible 
for driving Lord Tenchi away because of my own inaction."

**********************************************************************

	Down the hallway, one Mihoshi Kuramitsu was still sound asleep, curled up 
in a ball underneath her blanket.  Catching a ray of sunlight in her eyes, she 
squinted and rolled over, knocking one of the books that still littered her bed 
onto the floor.  It hit the hardwood with a thud, causing her to swipe out with 
her free hand for her non-existant alarm clock.  Her hand instead hit her bed's 
headboard.

	"AOWWWWW!!"  Mihoshi shot up and grabbed her hand instinctively.  "That 
smarts!  Huh...?"  She looked around her room frantically.  "Tenchi?...How...how 
did I get into bed?  I don't remember even laying down last night..."  Slowly, 
the last night's events came back to her.  "Oh, I must have fallen asleep while 
I was...oh my!"  Mihoshi grabbed her head.  "Did I actually...?  I couldn't 
have!  Not with Tenchi, he's my friend, but...but I just can't remember!"

	Mihoshi pulled off her covers and sat up on the edge of her bed.  She 
rubbed her face to wake herself up, then stopped halfway and kept her hands on 
her face as she thought about what had happened.  "What did we do?  I remember 
getting a call from Captain Nobeyama about grandfather...(oh, grandfather, why 
did you have to die?)...but most of the rest of it I'm drawing a blank on."

	Suddenly, Mihoshi heard her stomach rumble.  She looked down and grabbed 
at it.

	"Oh...I'd better eat something if I want to think about this clearly."

*********************************************************************

	"Wow, mmph, ju war wite, Tinchee, dis innit bad.  Pwee good actuwee...," 
Ryoko complimented through a mouthful of breakfast.

	Washu, sitting next to Ryoko, reached behind her and slapped her on the 
back, causing Ryoko to nearly choke on her food.

	Ryoko pounded herself on her chest to swallow, then gasped for air for a 
few seconds before turning about and getting in Washu's face.  "Now what the 
hell was that for!?"

	Washu took a bite of squash and responded calmly, "Don't talk with your 
mouth full, dear, it's bad manners."

	Across the table, Sasami and Tenchi ate quietly.  Sasami tried to avoid 
Tenchi's gaze, and he took note of that, but didn't say anything for the first 
few minutes after he sat down to eat.  As he searched for something to say to 
her, he caught movement out of the corner of his eye on the stairs.

	"Good morning, everyone!" Mihoshi cheerily greeted as she descended the 
staircase.

	"Ohayo, Mihoshi," Tenchi responded somewhat uneasily.  Washu gave her a 
wave.  Ryoko didn't reply at first, but also gave her a quick wave after a nudge 
from her mother.  Sasami still remained silent.

	"Aren't you going to say good morning to Mihoshi, Sasami?" Tenchi asked as 
he looked over at the little princess.

	Sasami's lip quivered.  "I...I don't wanna...," she said eventually into 
her chest.

	Washu looked up from her bowl.  "Is everything all right, Sasami?" she 
asked, concerned.

	"Uh-uh."

	"Do you want to talk about it?" Tenchi asked.

	Mihoshi yawned and sat down at the head of the table.  "Oh, that's okay.  
I don't mind.  You know, if you're sick, Sasami, I can get you some cold 
medicine.  It seemed to work just fine when I gave some to Ryoko."

	"Oh, yeah right, Mihoshi, the only reason I stopped protesting was to get 
you off my back.  That medicine tasted like crap and didn't help me at all."  
She added under her breath, "Besides, that's not why I was acting like I was 
anyway."

	Mihoshi looked mildly shocked.  "Oh...well, if you ever need some, just 
ask!"

	"I'm not sick!" Sasami practically yelled.  Everyone turned to her, 
surprised at her tone.  She blushed, then added, much quieter, "I'm not sick.  
I'm all right, really."

	It was clear as day to Tenchi now.  Something was up, and it most 
certainly had to do with what happened between him and Mihoshi last night.  Had 
Aeka *and* Sasami heard his fight with Ryoko?  It had to be...Aeka was acting 
too strange, and now Sasami was as well.  "But what can I say right now to her?  
Mihoshi's sitting right here...I don't want to upset her again.  Wait...does 
Mihoshi even know what's going on?  I'd better keep quiet until I know for 
sure." he thought to himself.

	The group returned to silence once more, the only sounds being the 
clinking of dishware, and Ryoko's rather loud eating habits.  Mihoshi, 
uncomfortable at this silence, decided to break it once more.  "So...where's 
Aeka this morning?  I see she's not down here eating with us.  Isn't she 
hungry?"

	"I...don't think so, Mihoshi.  She seemed pretty depressed when I talked 
to her earlier," Tenchi said.

	Ryoko stood up and brought her palms down, hitting the table and shaking 
the plates on it.  "What!?  You went up to see Aeka before me?  What the hell 
for?"

	Oh no, not again...  This was quickly fraying Tenchi's nerves.  It seemed 
like such an innocent comment.  But even his patience was nearly shot, and he 
couldn't dance around the issue anymore.  If he was going to have to drag it out 
right there at the breakfast table, then so be it.  He jolted up to face Ryoko.

	"Listen Ryoko, all I did was ask her if she wanted some breakfast.  I 
didn't even go into her room!  Man, I go out and help you, and this is what I 
get?"

	"Ha, so you just came outside to make yourself feel good!  I knew it!" 
Ryoko growled.

	"No!  I came outside because I care about you!  I came outside to prove to 
you that I didn't have sex with Mihoshi last night!"

	Mihoshi, sitting between them, gasped, then blushed.

	"But I have to go to school, Ryoko!  I can't stay here all day and coddle 
your hurt feelings because of something you *thought* I did!  Poor Mihoshi here 
doesn't even know about our fight last night!"

	"Oh give me a fucking break, Tenchi, she's still trying to figure out how 
many eggs there are in a dozen!"

	Mihoshi, who had been quiet up until now, too shocked to say anything, 
finally stood up and faced Ryoko herself.  "Listen, Ryoko, I may be a little 
clumsy at times, but I am not an idiot!"

	Then it happened.  Ryoko reared back and belted Mihoshi across the face.  
The detective reeled backwards as blood flew from her nose.  
	"Mihoshi, no!"  Tenchi instinctively reacted and caught her as she fell to 
the floor, seemingly in slow motion.  Everyone seemed to gasp at once, and the 
entire room fell silent for a moment, until...

	"STOP IT!  Stop it, all of you!  I knew this would happen!  I knew it 
would!" Sasami screamed.  She bolted up and ran from the room, crying loudly.  
Aeka, who had finally come out of her room, was nearly run over by Sasami as she 
ran past her, pulled open the sliding door, and ran out onto the dock.

	"Sasami?  What's going on?" she asked as she reached the bottom of the 
stairs.  She turned and ran into the dining room.  "What just happened?  It was 
you, wasn't it Ryoko!?  Or maybe you, Tenchi!?  Talk, I want some answers!"

	"I thought you had grown up, Ryoko, I really did.  I thought maybe my 
common sense had rubbed off on you, but I see now that you still have alot to 
learn," Washu said in a hard voice as she stood up and folded her arms across 
her chest.

	Aeka, who had been so demanding a moment before, rushed over to Tenchi and 
Mihoshi when she saw her condition.  She knelt down next to them, concern 
written all over her face.  "Mihoshi, are you all right?  Tenchi, what happened 
to her?"

	"Don't worry, Aeka, I'll take care of her.  Just go to Sasami, I'll handle 
this," he said, his voice even, yet mixed with an undeniable tension.  Aeka 
nodded and ran from the room, calling Sasami's name once she was outside.

	Ryoko, after she had hit Mihoshi, had frozen in place.  All she did now 
was stare down at her hand with her mouth agape, unable to even move.  She 
couldn't believe she had done that.  After all the arguments, after all the 
screaming and the sulking, she never imagined that she would ever hit anyone.  
Last night it was Tenchi, and today it was Mihoshi, who had done absolutely 
nothing wrong.  Even Ryoko could see the critical error in judgement she had 
made, and she realized it the very moment after her arm completed its arc across 
Mihoshi's face.  This was unexcusable, and she knew it.

	"So Ryoko, do you see now?  Do you see what foolishness this is?  I hope 
you're happy, Ryoko, because Mihoshi is unconscious.  She didn't deserve that, 
but you know that, don't you?  You knew it yet you did it anyway.  After I 
trusted you, after I tried to tell you that it wasn't your fault, even after I 
held you," Tenchi said in the same even, unsettling voice that Ryoko had used 
the night before.

	Washu walked over to where Mihoshi lay and knelt down next to her.  She 
brought up her ethereal laptop and typed in a few commands.  "She is 
unconscious, but she'll be okay.  Here, take this," she said as she typed in a 
command, opened a hole into subspace, and pulled out a small bottle.  She gave 
the bottle to Tenchi.

	"What is this, Washu?" he asked.

	"Smelling salts.  Yeah, you gave Mihoshi a good wallop, Ryoko, but you 
were holding back.  I know, that certainly doesn't excuse it, but if you had 
used your full power, you would have broken every bone in her face, and likely 
killed her.  Be glad you didn't."

	This unintended near-realization of the promise Ryoko had made to Tenchi 
snapped her out of her stupor, and she slowly walked over to the trio and knelt 
down as well.  "Give me the bottle, Tenchi," she said quietly, on the verge of 
tears.

	Tenchi looked up at her.  She sounded more sincere than he'd ever heard, 
and he complied.  Ryoko took the bottle, unstopped it, and began gently waving 
it under Mihoshi's nose.  Both Washu and Tenchi noticed her extremely serious 
expression.

	"This is my fault.  I am very sorry...there was no reason for what I did.  
But it is done, and helping Mihoshi is my responsibility now.  After all we've 
done for each other, I am not going to see us split apart because I was an 
idiot."  She looked up at them, and smiled slightly.  "I'd rather die first.  I 
know what you're thinking, that I'd only die for you, right, Tenchi?  Well, 
maybe that's true, but what's also true is that I honor my friendships that I 
share with all of you.  So, if ever there was a time to trust me, Tenchi, let it 
be now.  Let me help Mihoshi.  Both of you go see how Aeka and Sasami are doing, 
I'll stay here and watch her."

	Washu nodded.  "I knew you weren't completely lost to me, Ryoko."  She 
stood up and began running towards the door.  Tenchi remained kneeling, staring 
at Ryoko as she cradled Mihoshi under her.  "Come on, Tenchi!  If you've got any 
sense left in you, it's time to put it to good use.  There's one more of us who 
needs your help."

	"Right."  Tenchi stood up and followed her.  At the door, he turned back 
one last time to Ryoko and Mihoshi, then headed outside.

***************************************************************************

	Sasami was crying softly to herself at the end of the dock, with her knees 
pulled up to her chest.  Aeka was sitting next to her, stroking her back and 
listening as Sasami choked out painful words between sobs, repeating them over 
and over again.

	"I knew this was going to happen, Aeka...I knew they'd get into a fight!  
You were right...and now Mihoshi's dead!  She's dead, and now everyone hates 
each other, just like I knew would happen!"

	Aeka hugged Sasami close, trying her best to comfort her sister.  "Shhh, 
Mihoshi isn't dead, Sasami.  Whatever happens, we'll get through this.  Even if 
Lord Tenchi has chosen Mihoshi, we'll get through this."  Aeka looked out over 
the water, which was now brilliantly lit by a full morning sun.  The water 
lapped against the dock, and she thought, "I sure hope we can, at least."  
Suddenly she heard wood creak behind her and turned to face Washu and Tenchi 
standing right behind them.

	"H-how long have you two been standing there?" she asked.

	"Long enough, Aeka, long enough," Tenchi said to her.  He walked over at 
sat down next to Sasami.

	Sasami sniffled and wiped her nose.  "She's dead, isn't she, Tenchi?"

	Tenchi reached out and stroked Sasami's hair.  "No, she isn't, Sasami, 
just hurt.  But she'll be okay.  Ryoko didn't mean to hurt her.  I think," he 
sighed, "I think we're all just misunderstanding each other.  I didn't mean for 
this to get as out of hand as it has.  I didn't mean to hurt you, or Miss Aeka."

	"But...but you two were fighting last night, and then this morning.  And 
the thing is...I'm old enough to know what it was about, and it scares me.  I 
know that Ryoko and sis don't want you to pick anyone else but them, and they 
always get mad when you seem like you are going to.  But I don't care about 
that, Tenchi, I just want us to be friends!  I don't see what all this fighting 
is getting us!"

	Tenchi seemed mildly taken by surprise at her insight, especially 
considering her young age.  "It isn't getting us anywhere, Sasami.  I know that, 
and I don't like seeing it anymore than you do.  But it's okay now, Ryoko is 
helping Mihoshi out now.  Miss Washu gave her some smelling salts, and said 
she's doing all right.  Right, Washu?"

	"That's right, Sasami.  I'm not going to lie to you, Mihoshi's going to 
need some time to rest and recover, but she'll be okay," Washu said.

	"But Tenchi, I have a question for you," Aeka said, "Ryoko said that you 
and Mihoshi had...well...," she blushed and was unable to continue.

	"...had sex," Sasami finished.

	Aeka turned a deep red.  "Sasami!"

	"Oh, come on, sis, you think I don't know about it?  Mom taught me all 
about it while we were still on Jurai.  I know you think about doing it with 
Tenchi, and so does Ryoko."

	"Heh heh, Lady Misaki huh?  Yeah, she seemed pretty open about that kind 
of stuff when she was here last time.  I guess kids are learning about it at an 
earlier and earlier age these days," Tenchi commented.

	"But I know that it can cause big problems for people when they think that 
the one they love is taken away from them.  Mommy told me about that, too.  She 
says she's accepted that daddy loves both her and Lady Funaho," Sasami added, a 
note of authority in her voice.  "Remember that, sis?  When mom told us about 
that?"

	Aeka thought for a moment, then responded, "Yes.  Now that you mention it 
Sasami, I do.  Mother always did have a way with words, especially when it came 
to her love life.  I suppose...I suppose I jumped to conclusions, Tenchi.  I 
know that you wouldn't betray our trust like that.  And even if you had, we 
should be mature enough to accept it.  It would be unbecoming of the Jurai royal 
family to turn our backs on a loved one just because he has made the choice to 
express his love more strongly to another."

	Tenchi smiled at her.  "Thank you, Aeka.  I know that this was tough for 
you both, but we're all still friends.  That will not change.  But now that 
you've said all that, I suppose you're going to stop fighting with Ryoko over 
me?"

	Aeka smiled back at him coyly.  "Not a chance, Ten-chan.  I'm still 
determined to win your heart no matter what the cost.  But...I think I'll lay 
off on her for awhile.  She's in enough pain as it is.  Even I'm not going to 
take advantage of the wounded like that."

	Tenchi laughed uneasily, and rubbed the back of his head.  "Heh heh, I 
guess some things never change."  He stood up and stretched.  "Well, I think 
it's about time for me to be getting to school.  If it's all right, I'm going to 
get changed."  However, as he started back to the house, he felt someone grab 
him around the waist and hug him.  He looked down and saw Sasami, with her face 
buried in his side.  "What's that for, Sasami?"

	The princess craned her neck up to look him in the eyes, hers still 
brimming with tears, only these were tears of joy.  "That was for being a good 
guy, Tenchi.  Well, I'll see you inside!"  With that, she took off, skipping 
happily down the dock to the house.

	Aeka stood up as well and brushed off her dress.  She walked over to 
Tenchi and put her hand on his shoulder.  He turned to her.  "Thank you, Ten-
chan.  I swear, you honestly have a way with her that even I don't have.  I'll 
see you inside."  She too now walked off to the house.

	"You'd make your mother proud, Tenchi," Washu said behind him.  "You did 
it, you made things right again.  But I knew you would.  You're just like your 
mother that way, empathic right to your core."  Washu walked up next to him.  
"Yes, Tenchi, I believe that Achika would commend you on how you handled that."

	"Thanks, Washu.  You know, I could almost feel her with me this morning.  
I think she helped me more than I know.  Well, let's get inside.  I've got to 
get to school, or I'll be late."

	"Sounds good to me, I've got some work to catch up on anyway.  If I don't 
see you before you leave, have a good day at class.  And don't sleep through 
study hall...it's there for a reason."

	"Heh, okay okay.  I'll study this time."

**********************************************************************

	Ryoko was just carrying a semi-conscious Mihoshi to the couch when the 
foursome came back inside.  She gently laid her down and pulled a throw blanket 
over her.  Mihoshi began moving her arms around, and slowly opened her eyes.

	"Ry-Ryoko...," she whispered.

	"Hey, don't try to talk...just rest.  I'm sorry, Mihoshi...I didn't mean 
to hit you.  I just got angry for no reason.  Huh, that's just like me, isn't 
it?"  She put down the smelling salts on the end table and wiped her forehead 
with a napkin she had picked up from the table.  Just then, Sasami came in and 
ran up to the couch.

	"Mihoshi!  Are you all right?  How is it?" she asked eagerly.

	"Ohh, my head hurts, Sasami, but I'm okay.  Ryoko packs quite a punch.  
I'm surprised at how hard she hits.  Might make a good...Galaxy Police officer 
one day," she replied in a somewhat broken voice.

	Ryoko chuckled a bit.  "Yeah, right.  The day I become a cop is the day I 
start dating Aeka.  But I'm surprised, too.  You can really take a punch, 
Mihoshi.  Most people I hit don't get up after I lay one into them.  You're a 
tough little bitch."

	Mihoshi half laughed/coughed at this comment.  "Thanks, Ryoko.  Good to 
hear it."

	"And, Mihoshi?  I...didn't mean it when I called you an idiot.  I 
apologize."

	"Huh?  Oh, Ryoko, you didn't call me an idiot.  You said that I was still 
trying to figure out how many eggs were in a dozen.  Well, it's thirteen, isn't 
it?  You meant a baker's dozen, right?  Or a regular dozen?  You really have to 
be more...specific next time."

	Sweatdrops appeared on both Ryoko and Sasami.  "Yep, I think she's back to 
normal, Ryoko," Sasami said.  Just then, Aeka, Washu, and Tenchi returned.  As 
they entered, Ryo-ohki bounded down the stairs and hopped up into Sasami's arms.  
She "mya-ed" eagerly.

	"Hee hee, it's okay, Ryo-ohki, I'm okay now.  I'm not sad anymore.  We're 
all okay."

	"Mya!  Mya miaow!"  

	Sasami petted her and put her on her head.  "Well, I guess I'll clear the 
dishes from breakfast," she said, and began walking towards the dining area.

	"Oh, Sasami?  Are you sure you don't want me to take care of those?" Washu 
asked just before she was about to enter her lab.

	"No, Washu.  It's okay, I really don't mind.  Oh, but be sure to come out 
for dinner, I've got something extra special planned," the princess said 
cheerfully.

	"Okay, see you then!" Washu then closed the door to her lab behind her.

	"And I'll help you wash the dishes, Sasami.  It's the least I can do for 
making you stay up all last night," Aeka said after Washu had left.  Sasami 
nodded her approval, and the duo started cleaning up.

	Meanwhile, Tenchi headed upstairs to his room.  He slid open his door, 
walked over to his dresser, and pulled out his uniform.  He folded it and 
brought it over to his bed, which he slumped down onto.

	"Phew!  What a day!" he said out loud to himself.  He lay for a few 
moments before looking over at the clock.  It read 7:25.  "Oh, man, it's late.  
I better get a shower in!  My bus will be here in 20 minutes!"  He jolted up, 
grabbed his uniform, and ran for the bathroom.

********************************************************************

	The walk to the bus, or rather the run to the bus, was unusually 
satisfying to Tenchi that morning.  He was prepared to suffer through the whole 
day not knowing what was going on at his house, or if everyone would hate him 
and each other when he returned.  But that preparation was unnecessary.  Tenchi 
had underestimated himself, and the members of his household.  Back in the "old 
days," Tenchi thought, Ryoko and Aeka would never make up like that.  Huh, the 
"old days," back a year ago when he had never heard of any of them, and Ryoko 
was a frightening demon living in a cave.  Yes, things had changed.  Back in the 
old days, Ryoko would never care for anyone like she was now doing with Mihoshi.  
Back then, he was lucky to get everyone to call a truce, let alone understand 
*why* they were doing so.

	These memories ran through his mind almost as fast as he ran down the 
tree-lined road to his bus stop.  After a few minutes, he saw the familiar sight 
of the red and white sign approaching, and he knew he was going to make it.  
Just as Tenchi reached his stop, however, he saw the squat figure of the green 
and white bus approach, the sun glinting off of the glass and shiny paint job.

	"Just in time," he thought.  "Just in time."
