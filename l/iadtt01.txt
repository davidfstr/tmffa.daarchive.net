"ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME TENCHI!"
Chapter 1: Its About Damn Time

Dec 15, 2000 6:30am
	`Riiing, Riiing,' Tenchi's alarm clock was going off.
"No! Don't wake me now clock I was having a good dream about Mihoshi 
and Kiyone!" Tenchi thought, he got up and clicked the button on the clock 
and wondered why Ryoko had not waken him up by appearing before 
him naked or something.
"Oh well its good she's stopped that, I was starting to re-think 
my decisions." He whispered to himself. He remembered what he had talked 
about with his father and grandfather the night before.
******FLASHBACK********
"Dad, Grandpa? Can I talk to you for a bit?" Tenchi asked the two men 
who were drinking some special sake Washuu gave them.
"Sure son, which one did you get pregnant, wait don't tell me, Sasami?" 
Nobuyuki answered
"Dad quit being so Hentai!"
"Yes Nobuyuki, I'm sure its got something to do with at least ONE of the 
beautiful women in this household, but nothing THAT severe." Katsuhito 
scolded his son-in-law.
"Damn your Jurai intuition!" Nobuyuki pouted about not being able to 
tease his son with sex jokes.
"Well Grandpa, I know since you're from Jurai you probably wanted me to 
get with Ayeka or even Sasami, but my mind is made up, I love Ryoko, I 
just need some help on how to tell her, and more importantly the other 
girls, especially Ayeka!" Tenchi said sitting next to Katsuhito/Yosho, 
who didn't really mind either name.
"Well my son tomorrow after you get up we'll tell the girls we're 
going into Tokyo, for some family business and you can get 
Ryoko something!" Nobuyuki suggested.
"Well then I better not come, I'm from Jurai remember, all my daughter's 
Earth rights passed onto you Nobuyuki and then to you Tenchi." Katsuhito 
said matter-of-factly.
"Thanks, I'm going to bed." Tenchi hugged his father and bowed to his 
grandfather, just as Tenchi got to his room, a sleepy Ryoko came 
from her room and immediately saw the sake.  Naturally she had to have 
some, well a lot.
******END FLASHBACK******
"Well today's the day, and what a beautiful day, birds chirping, sun 
shining," Tenchi began but was inturrupted by a loud screeching sound, 
"OH CRAP! BIRDS CHIRPING, SUN SHINING, AND YAGAMI CRASHING!" Tenchi 
screamed as he ran downstairs to get Mihoshi and Kiyone out of another 
mess.
	He got downstairs just in time to catch the wall of water hitting 
him in the face.  But it wasn't a splash from Yagami it was a spray from 
Ryo-Ohki's jets, it seemed Sasami was outside at the time and used 
Ryo-Ohki to help them.
"That girl's got one hell of a head on those shoulders, whenever she 
finds someone to love she'll make them happy." Tenchi said barely 
whispering.
"Ryo-Ohki send them to Washuu and tell her what happened.!" Sasami yelled, 
"Wow years of playing Pokemon has really helped my Cabbit controlling 
abilities!" she beamed.
"Wow Sasami nice reaction time!" Tenchi said trying to get the water 
out his ears.
"Thanks, Tenchi, say are you hungry?" Sasami quickly changed subjects.
"Sure am." Tenchi answered.
********about 7:00am in Washuu's Lab*********
"Kiyone what happened?  There were no signs of a battle! Did Mihoshi 
screw up again?" Washuu had one question after another.
"Nah this wasn't her fault!" Kiyone said holding her head, "Our fuel 
gage was broken and we thought we had a quarter of a tank left!"
"Oh" was all Washuu had to say.
"By the way where is Mihoshi?" Kiyone asked.
"She got knocked out but its nothing a few days of recovery won't fix! 
Espicially with Washuu the greatest scientific genius in the UNIVERSE 
as her doctor!" Washuu said holding up one finger.
"Well I'm going visit with that ditz, thanks Washuu.er Little Washuu." 
Kiyone called to the short scientist as she ran out, as all the 
household knew even though they fought a lot Kiyone and Mihoshi were 
REALLY good friends.
*****back in the kitchen*****
Everybody was sitting down to eat their breakfast when they noticed
one thing...Ryoko was missing."Dad did Ryoko get drunk after I went to bed?" Tenchi asked
"Uh..no son..w-why would you think that my boy." Nobuyuki said holding 
his hands in front of his face.
"Damnit dad Washuu made that sake, she usually tries to keep Ryoko from 
drinking any by putting something in it to affect Ryoko and only Ryoko!" 
Tenchi yelled standing up, "I'm going to check on her."
"Lord Tenchi, that devil woman is not important is she? She'll just
 come down and cause the usual flak." Ayeka stood up and grabbed 
Tenchi's shirt.
"Well Ayeka, she is a guest in this house as are the rest of you and 
I have to see if she's ok. And because it is the USUAL flak I'd miss 
it if it never happened today." Tenchi said smiling, he knew he HAD 
to check on her, but it's because he WANTED to that made it so much better.
