-Chapter 4-
Mother of the Bride

        Takero was alone in the family home while her younger children attended school
and her oldest child attended marriage preparation discussions with her fiance. She spent
most of the morning tidying up the house; dusting, sweeping, and making sure everything
looked just so. When that was done, she sat and meditated for about an hour. She was
happy for Shiasta, but worried at the same time. Even though Shiasta was quite capable of
doing things on her own, Takero sometimes suffered from sudden pangs of doubt. Her
husband would be off working most of the day. Could Shiasta really manage to take care of
a home, and perhaps one day children, when she couldn't even walk?
        To comfort herself, Takero read up on all the latest devices and services available
including monitors, safety screens of very fine mesh that went over playpens so a
baby couldn't just crawl out, and live-in nannies who could act as her daughter's legs
whenever a child needed chasing after.
        When Shiasta got home, Takero voiced her concerns.
        "Mother!" Shiasta laughed. "I haven't even gotten married yet, and already
you've got me having kids!"
        "I just worry about you." Takero admitted.
        "Wasn't it you who kept going on and on about how there was no reason for me not to
marry?" Shiasta scolded, amusedly. "You were right, mom. Now relax, okay?"
        Takero nodded. "You're right." She told her daughter.
