    "Koran!" Ryoko yelled as she and Lance disappeared into air. I grabbed
her hand but it vanished. They were gone, and it was my fault. My fault I
had
brought Ryoko into this mess. I should've told her. But I didn't. And now
she's gone, its my fault.
    I slowly floated to the ground. My head down. I tear fell from my face.
*Shes gonna be killed. I just barely reached level two. 1 year to reach 3?
Its not fair. Thats impossible.* I lifted my head. *No not impossible.
Nothings impossible. And i no just the person you can turn improboblity to a

real.
****************
    I was flying back to masaki home. *How can I face them* I questioned my
self. *What tell them " well my arch rival showed up and kidnapped her right

when we were fixing to make out?" Sheesh. but I have to tell the somthing.*
I
flew over a hill. The shiren came into view. that means the house is just
over here. Sure enouph the House appeared immense the trees. I landed at the

front door and hesitated. Hand hovering just over the door knob. Suddenly a
scream and a crash came from withen the house and the door flew open.
    "Lance!" I yelled. Lance was in the doorway. with somestuff over is
shoulder.
    "Hello Koran. Just came to pick up a few of Ryokos things." He said
smirking.
    I drew back my fist and swung. a direct hit sqaure on the jaw. He  took
a
step back. then looked at me. About then I couldn't move. I was lifted up
and
suddenly i was moving backward. Then there was a kunk. everything became
fuzzy. And i blacked out.

    My eyes slowly opened. Everything cleared out. I was definently in
Washus
lab. As things cleared out I saw washu off to the side typeing away. Tenchi
and Ayeka were bye my side. The hearth Moniter made a madding Beep beep
sound.
    "Uhhhhh." I groaned. I had a termendous headache.
    "He's comeing around." Tenchi said. And Kieona and Sasami came from the
bench in the corner followed bye Mioshi, Who triped.
    "Tenchi. ." I gronded
    "Yeah"
    "Turn off that damn hearth moniter" I said.
    Tenchi laughed and switched it off.
    "What the hell happened." I asked.
    "That man came in, and took all of ryokos stuff. You got in his way but
he threw you into a tree. The  tree fell down on you and knocked you cold."
    " Its amazing anyone can survive that. That was a 100 years old, 500bl.
Oak tree ." washu said.
    "God damnit I want a senzu" I said laying back
    "A sen. .what?"
    "Check my pocket, a little green bean in a pouch." I said
    Tenchi took out the pouch and threw one to me. I grabbed it and stuffed
it in my mouth. All at once I i had my energy back. I got up and blured on
to
the floor.
    "Much Better"
    "how. ." Washu said stumped.
    "Here" I said and toosed her one. "figure it out. After all" I winked at

her "You are a genius"
    "Well I have a story to tell" I said and began tell them the whole
story.
*************
    ". . .And thats it." I said finishing the whole 9 yards.
    They all just look at me, stumped.
    "okayyy" I said slipping away. "Washu?"
    "Yeah"
    "You still have that simulator up."
    "Yeah"
    "Cool"
    "Yeah"
    *Okay lets get outta here.* I took off.
***************
    "Yah, Yah Yah" I said delivering three kicks to the android. busting it
to peices. I sensed one behind me. I flipped into the air as it stirked. As
I
came down. I kicked its metal head off.
    "Computer new simulation I yelled. Suddenly I was in a plain. And a
green
man appeared in front of me."
    "Ahh, history. Thats Cell" I said turning it up to SSJ2. Cell Jumped at
me. I dodged one punch and kicked him in the sides breaking some of is ribs
with a sickening CRACK.
    He grabbed his side and yelled in pain. He backed up then He yelled and
four Cell Jrs. appeared. They attack at once.  I dodged the first one and
slamed the second into the ground the 3rd started punching me but I dodged
its attack. Then on latched on to me from my back. The other 3 Backed up
    "KAmehame. . ." they all said in course. I wedged on arm lose and
brought
it to my for head.
    "HA!! The yelled and all three fired a kamehameha at me. I put my
fingers
on my forhead and was instently gone. From a safer point I watched the
attacks rip the one latched on to me to shreds.
    "Thats just not right. . ." I said. The other three turned to me but
before they couold react one met a very unlucky fate involing my foot and
his
head. He blew up into dust.
    Cell Jr. 2 and 4 flew int the air and did a susidle dive strait at me.
    "Not To bright are we" I said and fired blast. They ran strait into the
blast killing the instently.
    "Take this!" Cell said and i turned to meet a foot. In a instent I
caught
is foot. His grin turned frown.
    "This. .Is gonna hurt" I said and released a blast. The blast ripped him

apart. All that was left was a his leg whjich i held in my hand.
    "Ha" I said and tossed away the leg. The came a squishing sound. I
turned
to see the leg was doing something. Slowly something pushed its way from the

leg. The all at once Cells whole body sprouted from the one leg.
    "Oh Man" i said. the New Cell. Charged at me. he jumped at me.
    I took a breath. "MIND FREEZE!" I yelled. Suddenly the space all around
cel became a blue color. Cell stopped in mid-air.
    Coolly I walked up to cell. Grined and fired a blast that incenrated
cells complete body.
    Clap, Clap Clap. I turned around. Tenchi was leaning agianst the pole.
    "Impressive" he said. "care to fight me"
    "You dont stand a a chance."
    "We wil see" He said. He took out a short stick. The a beam saber
erupted
from the stick. "Meet tenchi" he said
    "Computer" I said and raised my hand suddenly a short black metalic
stick
apeared in my hand. For a second my arm glowed golden. the A Golden beam
erupted from the stick.
    The background changed suddenly it was night. Tenchi attacked. He swung
his saber down at me. My blade swung up to counter it. It was on.
    He jumped at me. Swing. Block. Whenever our blades connected a
explodsion
of power boomed. I jumped. And fliped over him. I landed. I swung. He
blocked. Krak-KABOOM. I jumped back. I stabed. He dodged. He swung. I
blocked. Krackle-Krackle- KABOOM. Now it was so dark only the glow of the
sabers could be seen. He stabed I jumped. I Kicked he dodged. He swung. I
ducked. I backfliped. I threw my saber and blured. he dodged. I caught. I
swung. He barely blocked. The Saber was but inches from his chest. I
strained
and pushed. he s took a step back. This was my chance. I pulled away. Ducked

and stabbed. . . . .Connect. . . .
    The darkness faded. Tenchi was sprawled on the floor gasping. His hand
was clutched tight over his side. He screamed in agony.
    "Here tenchi" I stuffed a senzu in his mouth. Withen a few seconds. He
calmed down and got up. He looked him self over.
    "You not so bad." I said as i helped him up.
    "You were good yourself." He said. He started for the door.
    "Hey, tenchi wait up." I called. Tenchi turned
    "Yeah"
    "Yah know. I need a desent training partner. These programes are shit."
    "I'll do it." he said grinning. I grined back.
****************
    *6 long months.* The door of the training simulater swung. *6 long long
months.* I walked out. My clothes were torn. *But im free now*. Over my
sholder i carried Tenchi out. He was ripped and torn worst than I was. Blood

energy inside of me. I gathered it, and fired. The attack was small, but
enough. I hit a big machine and it exploded. "Alright" I said and feel to
the
floor.
****************
    It was raining. As the rain came down, i had a bad permenition.
 "HYYYYAHHHH" I powered up. I was home in a flash.
    "Mom, Dad. Are you home." No one answered. it was a dark house. Now my
premenistion was stronger than ever. "They musta went out" i thought out
loud.I walked in and turned on the light. Man it was a day a mentors. I was
totaled. Went over to to the couch. and sat down. I turned on the TV. A good

action movie wasw on. This guy did three flips back ward. jump up and came
down and kicked this guy in the face.
    "I can do that." I said and followed the same steps. When i kicked i
landed in the kicten. I gasped. I yelled. My motheres body, sprawled over
the
the floor.  Drenched in blood My father leaning agianst the self, had a
knife
peircing him. Blood rolled from his chest down to the floor.the knife had
gone clear through him and pined him to whe counter.
    "Wha?!?!" I said in disbelieve. A tear streamed down my face. I ran over

to my mothers body. "Mom." I called at her agian and agian. She didnt move.
 I ran over to my father. I pulled the knife out of him and he fell limply
into my arms. "Dad, No Dad NO!" My parents were dead.
    I felt Enragded . Who. .whould do this. And Why!. My anger was building
inside. I felt as if I was to explode. They would pay. I would make them
pay.
Suddenly I felt my self being powered up. The gravity around my dissapeared.

My hair floated into the air. I started glowing. The storm Outside had
gotten
worse The lighting fell Down. But that didnt Bother me. I couldn't hold it
in. My anger was overwelming. "AHHHHHHHHHH!!" I Yelled Suddenly A lighting
Bolt came down and tore apart my house. And it struck me. I stood There.
Memmerzied. Tryng to think straight, but my mind was yelling 'Kill! Kill!"
No
I wouldn't I must control. I finally got in control. I looked down at
myself.
I was glowing a golden aroura.
    "Ima...a. .Super sayian" I said as the floor started to crack. I had
finally done it. All the training with the mentor. My goals and dreams. Were

now mine. At the loss of my parents. I looked around at the ruins of my
house.suddnly i saw a burning note card.
Shes Next.
    "Oh No!" I said and took off. He wouldn't. No Please."I got there as

as i could. But it was in vain The house was in ruins.
    "No, NOOOOOOOOO!" I yelled as rain splattered across m face. Suddenly I
saw him. He was floating out of the house. In his arms. Brittany!

    "Korannnnnnn" She yelled before completely dissapearing.
    All I did was stare at him open mouthed. "You MONSTER!!!!" I yelled
suddenly My fist was in his gut. I no longer had control.  I kicked and
kicked.
He spit up blood as I continued to pound his.  I flew up. "KA. . .ME. . .HA.

    "NOoooo" He yelled as he was pummbled into the ground. I finally gained
control agian. I slowed fell back into sayian form. I went over to him. He
was barely alive. I wouldnt kill him. Nature would. I thought as I walked
off.
**************
    I opened my eyes Washu was standing next to me trying to force me onto
 a
strecter.  But she kept getting a mouth ful of golden hair.
    "Whats happened." I said weakly.
    "I want to know." Washu began "Why did you grow all this hair!"
    "What hair?" I said half dazed.
    Washu pulled a tuff out. "This hair!" SHe showed me as she wheeled my
along.
    I grabbed the lock of hair. Could I be. Filled with a sudden rush of
adrenaline i jumped up and ran to find a mirror.I found a clocjk on the
wall.
I pulled it down.  I saw me. My reflection. No eyebrows. Long Hair.
    "I. . .I did it" I said. I jumped into the air "YEAH! I DID IT!!" I was
a
Super Sayian Level 3.
*************
I walked out into the forest. 'Where was he'. I hought. It had ben 1 year
since the kidnapping.  Tenchi, Washu, Ayeka, Sasami, and Keyona had come
with
me. Meoshi was asleep.
    "Ah Koran " Said a voice as I entered a clearing. Lance leaned agianst a

tree. Next to him was ryoko tied to a tree. "I assume youve reached Level

H easid cockly.
    "And Then some." I said as I powered up to level 3. It was on.

strecter.  But she kept getting a mouth ful of golden hair.
"Whats happened." I said weakly.
"I want to know." Washu began "Why did you grow all this hair!"
"What hair?" I said half dazed.
Washu pulled a tuff out. "This hair!" SHe showed me as she wheeled my
along.
I grabbed the lock of hair. Could I be. Filled with a sudden rush of
adrenaline i jumped up and ran to find a mirror.I found a clocjk on the
wall.
I pulled it down.  I saw me. My reflection. No eyebrows. Long Hair.
