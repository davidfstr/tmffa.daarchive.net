Two Panes of Glass
By Doug Whiddon


	Ayeka snuggled against Tenchi's chest and sighed happily. 
Tenchi, however, could not sleep.  For the last few minutes an odd
feeling had been building in his gut.  He was still hungry, but this
was something different.
	Tenchi's life was weird enough that he knew better than to
ignore a feeling like this.
	"Better have a look around" he thought.
	Tenchi detangled himself from Ayeka's grasp and climbed
out of bed.
	"Tenchi...?" Ayeka sat up on bed, the sheet pressed to her
chest.  It clung to her body, damp from their lovemaking, like a
second skin.  For a moment Tenchi forgot why he had gotten out of
bed, struck by an almost irresistible urge to climb back into her
arms.
	Tenchi snapped himself out of it "I'll be back in a few
minutes, Ayeka"
	"Hurry back, my love." Ayeka whispered.
	Tenchi pulled on his loose pants and a clean shirt and
slipped out of the door.  Tenchi looked in on Sasami, who was
sleeping peacefully, he moved down the hall and peeked into
Mihoshi's room, Mihoshi never had trouble sleeping through
anything.  The last room down the hall was washuu's (and
sometimes Ryoko's)
	"Do you need something Tenchi?" Washuu was still
working despite the late hour.
	"have you seen Ryoko?"
	"She's probably on her perch over the living room."
	"Okay, thanks."
	 Tenchi walked quietly back down the hall, he stopped in
front of his room and peeked in.  Ayeka was sleeping peacefully,
the light from the full moon outside his window shined around her
head, giving her an angelic appearance. Tenchi closed the door and
walked downstairs.
	Ryoko was nowhere to be seen, her usual perch was bare
and she was not on the couch, Tenchi looked into the kitchen and
out the back door.  Still no Ryoko.
	Tenchi slipped on his shoes in the doorway and stepped
outside.  The odd feeling seemed to get stronger as he headed out
over the bridge, he heard a sound from the trees, and realized that
what he had been feeling was a building misery.  For there, huddled
under a large tree, sat Ryoko, her body shook as tears streamed
down her cheeks.
	One time before Tenchi had felt Ryoko call out to him,
when the being called Zero had captured her.  But  this was more
acute,  they seemed to have some sort of empathic bond.
	Tenchi stepped up to her and kneeled down beside her
"Ryoko...?" he said softly placing a  hand on her shoulder.
	Ryoko's head snapped up "Tenchi..."
	"What's wrong Ryoko?"
	Ryoko struggled with the words but finally she was able to
speak "You love Ayeka, not me."
	Tenchi should have known, he put his hand on Ryoko's
shoulder. "Ryoko, I do love Ayeka..."
	Ryoko's misery deepened
	"But I love you just as much."
	Ryoko stopped shaking, her head rose slowly, until her tear
streaked face and red eyes where level with Tenchi's face.  Her
voice shook "D-do you really mean that Tenchi?"
	Tenchi started to speak, but kissed Ryoko lightly instead.
	Ryoko's face brightened noticeably.
	Tenchi suddenly found himself lying under Ryoko on the
cool grass
	<What the...> Tenchi was a little surprised, Ryoko pressed
herself firmly against Tenchi's chest and covered his face in kisses.
	Tenchi was a little overwhelmed but quickly responded in
kind.
	Ryoko pulled off Tenchi's shirt and began lightly kissing her
way down his chest, loosening her clothing as she went.
	Tenchi lay back and let Ryoko have her way with him.
	Ryoko pulled Tenchi's pants off and tossed them aside. 
Tenchi was a little nervous, Ayeka had been much more sedate and
methodical, Ryoko however seemed to want to devour him. 
(Speaking of which) Ryoko was bobbing up and down between his
thighs.
	<This feels incredible> Tenchi felt more relaxed than he
ever had.  He realized that if she kept this up much longer he was
going to explode, and he doubted he could go for a third round
tonight.
	Tenchi grabbed Ryoko's arms and pulled her up level with
him, Kissing her deeply he rolled over, laying Ryoko out on the soft
grass.  Tenchi began to stroke Ryoko's thighs with his hand as he
began to lightly kiss Ryoko, starting with her neck and shoulders
and working his way down kissing and licking every exposed inch
of her sweet flesh.  
	Tenchi rubbed his palms against Ryoko's breasts, marveling
at how soft and firm they where, Washuu may joke about Ryoko's
breasts sagging, but every inch of her was just as tight and firm as it
could be. Ryoko's nipples became hard under Tenchi's palms. 
Tenchi brought his mouth to one of Ryoko's breasts and began to
suck gently.  Ryoko tipped her head back and moaned loudly, and
wrapped her arms around Tenchi's head.  Tenchi flicked his tongue
over her nipple.
	Tenchi  moved down Ryoko torso heading down towards
her groin.  Tenchi licked around the rim of Ryoko's belly button. 
Finally he arrived at her sex.  Ryoko's breathing became slightly
tough as Tenchi began to kiss her inner thighs, moving inward
slowly.  He came to her lips, slightly open and glistening.  Tenchi
breathed in her scent.  He began to lick along the edge of her sex 
and to flick his tongue against her clit.
	"Tenchi... I want you inside of me."  Ryoko sat up.
	Tenchi slid up level with Ryoko.  Her breasts pressed
against his chest, her nipples rubbed against him. 
	Ryoko wrapped her arms around Tenchi and pressed her
mouth against his.
	Tenchi slid into Ryoko and began to move slowly in and
out.
	After awhile they came together and lay still on the cool
grass.
	Ryoko was deep asleep. <I thought it was the guy who
always fell asleep afterwards>  Tenchi pulled his clothes back on;
and carefully, so as not to wake her, lifted Ryoko's sleeping form
and carried her back into the house.
	Tenchi lay Ryoko beside Ayeka in his bed, and pulled his
spare futon out from under the bed and was quickly asleep.

(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)

	"Aaaaaaaah!!!' Ayeka's scream pierced the morning.
	Tenchi awoke instantly "What! What, is it, who screamed."
Tenchi was somewhat less than coherent.
	Ayeka was standing on the bed, naked. "Wha... what is she
doing here!?" Ayeka pointed accusingly at Ryoko.
	"I could ask the same about you princess." Ryoko sat up in
bed and stretched. since she was naked this was quite a sight.
"Tenchi; where are my clothes?"
	"They're probably still out by the tree."
	Ryoko stepped over Tenchi and walked out the door.
Tenchi stared at her retreating form.
	The temperature in the room dropped noticeably. Avoiding
Ayeka's gaze Tenchi rolled up his futon and slid it back under his
bed. Finally her turned to face her. Ayeka's expression caused
Tenchi to recall his first encounter with dry ice; hard to imagine
something cold enough to burn. "Ayeka?"
	Ayeka turned away from him and spoke in careful measured
tones. "Jurian customs allow multiple people to marry, and if
Ryoko is your choice for second wife; then that is something I will
just have to get used to. However; in the future I would appreciate
waking up next to the same person I went to bed with." Ayeka
gathered her robe and left the room.
	Tenchi leaned back against his bed and sighed. "I think I
need a bigger bed."


	"A bigger bed?" Washuu's head poked up from behind her
terminal. "And just what would you need a bigger bed for?
Hmmm?" Washuu had an almost evil glint in her eye.
	"Mine's only big enough for two." Tenchi blushed slightly at
the thought of sharing his bed with Ayeka and Ryoko.
	"All right, It'll be there by lunch time. Now beat it, I have
work to do."
	Tenchi bowed deeply. "Thank you, little Washuu." Tenchi
turned and left the lab; he bumped into Ayeka on the way out,
literally.
	"Oh, Tenchi, excuse me."
	Tenchi helped Ayeka to her feet. "Ayeka, I was just about
to go looking for you."
	"Oh? What did you want?"
	"I though we should talk about last night,...and this
morning." Tenchi searched for his next words. There where so
many things he wanted to say. "Ayeka, why don't we go on a picnic
for lunch; that way we can spend some time together and talk about
things."
	Ayeka's face brightened. "You mean just you and I? What
about Ryoko?"
	"I'll deal with Ryoko, don't worry. Why don't you go and
see if you can talk Sasami into fixing us a picnic lunch; okay?"
	Ayeka nodded. "Alright."
	Tenchi went off to find Ryoko who had been curiosly absent
since breakfast.

(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)

	"A picnic? Really?" Sasami seemed excited by the prospect.
	"Yes, for Tenchi and I.” Ayeka smiled at the thought of
having Tenchi all to herself for an afternoon.
	“Let’s see, Tenchi’s father is away for the weekend, so that
means just six of us...” The ‘Tenchi and I’ part of Ayeka’s speech
had aparently gone over her head.
	“Uh, Sasami, I meant a picnic just for Tenchi and I, not the
whole family.
	Sasami stopped short. “You and Tenchi? Alone? Ryoko will
never let you get away withit.”
	Ayeka fumed. “Tenchi will deal with Ryoko, he promised.”
	“Okay. Hey, where you last night? Hm?” Sasmai grinned at
Ayeka. “And why did I see Ryoko walking naked out of Tenchi’s
room this morning?”
	Ayeka’s entire body went through three shades of red.
“Sasami you are far to young to be thinking about such things.”
	“Allright, but eventually you are going to tell me everything.
Oh, and don’t forget to save the sheet of Tenchi’s bed.”
	Confusion reigned. “His sheet? What for?”
	“Tradition.” Sasami  turned from Ayeka and continued
working in the kitchen.

Meanwhile.

	Tenchi found Ryoko on her usual perch over the living
room, she had a bottle of saki in front of her and Tenchi’s gameboy
in hand.
	“Ryoko.”
	Ryoko looked down at him. “Tenchi!” She disapeared from
her perch and reapeared wrapping herself around Tenchi in mid-air.
She proceeded to pull him into a deep kiss. The tail of Ryokos
outfit drew lazy circles in the air as they explored each others
mouths with their tounges. Ryoko pulled away from him. “Why
don’t we go back to your room and...”
	“Ryoko, we dont have time for that.”
	“So we miss breakfast, if you want something to nibble
on....” Ryoko let Tenchi’s mind fill in the blanks.
	Tenchi extracted himself from Ryoko’s embrace. “Ryoko,
will you please listen to me!”
	Ryoko floated back to the ground.
	“I told Ayeka that she and I would have a picnic lunch so
we could talk. I need you to promise that you won’t interfere,
okay?”
	“You and Ayeka? Alone?”
	Tenchi nodded.
	“Allright, but later you have to do something with me,
okay?”
	“Sounds fair.”


(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)( ^_^;) (^_^;)(^_^;)


	All the universe is ruled by one law. Murphys law. A
choralary to that law states that it always rains at picnics.
	The rain was coming down in a near flood. Tenchi and
Ayeka where inside the small cabin between the temple and the
house.
	"Why do feel like we've done this before" Tenchi built a
small fire in the metal box on the floor.
	Ayeka laughed, "we have remember?"
	"How could I forget" *it was the first time I held you in my
arms*. Tenchi wrung out his shirt and hung it on a nail, he took of
his shoes and socks and lay them against the wall. When he turned
around Ayeka was laying her multilayered garment on the bench
against the wall.
	Ayeka removed her innermost garment and lay it on the
bench with the others. She stood before him naked, only her key on
her forehead.
	Now it was Tenchi who stared. Ayeka was thin and pale,
her breast where the proverbial handful with rosy pink nipples. Her
stomach was flat, legs long and smooth. Tenchi's eyes where drawn
to the curly hairs between her legs. her hair color was apparently
natural.
	Ayeka put her arms around Tenchi, pressing her breasts into
his chest. She looked into his eyes. "Tenchi...."
	Tenchi kissed Ayeka. He ran his hands down her back and
over her rear, her skin was smooth and soft. He guided her down
onto the mat, her nipples where hard against his chest. He ended
their kiss, his mouth found her ear lobe. He nibbled softly. His right
hand slid down her side, over the curve of her hip and down her
leg. His left arm supported her. He kissed her cheek and the side of
her neck. He tickled the skin on the back of her knees.
	Ayeka reveled in the sensations Tenchi was evoking in her,
after so much time he was hers. But she felt a small amount of guilt.
Her education on Jurai had included several text on lovemaking.
For nobles it was a skill to be learned, not so much something done
on instinct. At the least a theoretical knowledge was expected. She
had saved herself for Yosho, so her practical experience was non-
existent. All her Jurian teachings said it was her responsibility to
please her partner.
	Of course, this was earth....
	Tenchi flicked his tongue across one of her nipples, her
breasts where extremely sensitive.
	....And heaven, she concluded.
	Ayeka wrapped her arms around Tenchi's neck. 
	Tenchi's right hand slid along her inside thigh, along her
abdomen and up to her breasts.  He held her left breast in his palm,
squeezing gently.
	Tenchi lowered Ayeka to the mat. He began to kiss her,
starting just below her breasts, he kissed her lightly down to the
valley between her legs. He felt like he was going to explode.
	Tenchi's toungue brushed Ayeka's clit, sending shockwaves
up and down her spine, her back arched as she came. Ayeka's hands
pressed Tecnhi's head into her sex.
	Ayeka realesed Tecnhi's head and lay back as the force of
her orgasm subsided.
	Tenchi gently spread open the lips of Ayeka's sex and slid in
up to the hilt.
	Ayeka sighed as her clit hit the base of Tenchi's cock.
	Tenchi leaned forward, his hands on either side of Ayeka,
holding himself above her. Ayeka slid her arms around him and
pulled him and kissed him. They began to move in together.


	A little later the couple lay on the blanket, the crackeling of
the fire and rain pelting the roof falling on their ears like a natural
symphony.
	Ayeka ran her hand down Tenchi's chest. "You know, under
Jurain law we have to get married now."
	Tenchi grinned. "I'm not sure I'm ready for marrige."
	"I think the rain's stopped."
	Tenchi listened carefully. "I think youre right." Tenchi stood
and pulled on his jeans. He opened the door and stepped out.
	dressing quickly, Ayeka joined him.
	"Come'on lets go." Tenchi held out his hand.
	Ayeka shook her head. "You go on ahead, I'll catch up.
There's something I need to do first."
	
	Ayeka stood at the foot of the tree Funaho. The holy tree of
Misaki shrine. Ayeka smiled. "You can make it rain if you pray for
it." Thats what Tenchi had said.
	Ayeka activated her key, the amber gems glowing softly.
"Thank you," she sent to the tree.


Probably not to be continued.
