Titles: Hello Uzuko!
        Marasuko the 2nd Genius!
        Don't Leave, Marasuko! (Not finish yet...)
Division: Lemon
Synopsis: This Fanfic is about a love triangle between my two new
characters, Uzuko and Marasuki, and Ayeka. And still, the endless
love triangle between Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi.



HI everyone! I only own some of characters that I made up. But, Ryoko,
Tenchi, Ayeka, Mihoshi, Sasami, Washu, Yosho, Noboyuki, and the rest
are entirely owned by AIC Pioneer, or something like that... So,
don't you dare sue me because I have no money... Well, I hope you
like my fanfic, and if you have any suggestions, e-mail me at
swtpnai2luv@AsianAvenue.com


                                TENCHI
                                 MUYO!

                              GENIUS!

Tenchi: Good morning Sasami, why are you up so early???
Sasami: I thought I'd get an early start to make my new recipe
Tenchi: What is it?
Sasami: Oh, chicken and vegetables mixed with some beef and lemon juice. I'm
running low on carrots, could you get me some?
Tenchi: Okay, anything for you my little chef.
Sasami: (Giggle) you're funny Tenchi, bye.
Tenchi: (Picks up baskets and walks out the front door) Okay, Sasami I'll be
back.
(Suddenly Uzuko appears in the kitchen)
Uzuko: Hey, Tenchi!
Tenchi: Huh? What, Uzuko?
Uzuko: What's today?
Tenchi: Oh, today's Monday!
Uzuko: Thanks! (Disappears to Washu's Lab. Thinks: Great, another day,
another testing...)
Tenchi: That was weird...

(While in the field, Tenchi has a visitor)

Ryoko: (Appears behind Tenchi and hugs him by the neck) Oh good morning my
sweet Ten-
Tenchi: Hey! Stop Ryoko! (Gets away from Ryoko)
Ryoko: (Giggles) Oh Tenchi............you know how to amuse this gal. (Just
when Ryoko was going to hug Tenchi Ayeka interrupts)
Ayeka: Monster you mean...........now you get away from Tenchi right this
instant!!!
Ryoko: Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Ayeka: I'm gonna...I'm gonna...gonna...........Tenchi!!!
Tenchi: (Picks up baskets and runs to the house)
Ryoko: Now look what you made him do!
Ayeka: What I did!!! (Starts to get red)
Ryoko: Just when he was about to kiss me.....
Ayeka: Now why would lord Tenchi want to kiss an old demon like YOU
anyway... (Devilishly grins) when he could have a princess like me.
Ryoko: (turns red) An old demon huh!!! (Makes a fireball and throws it at
Ayeka)
Ayeka: (Jumps and lands) Getting old makes the brain cells weak.........and
believe me..........your pretty old (Laughs devilishly)
Ryoko: Believe me...that was just a practice shot. Here's the real thing...
(Makes another fireball and throws it at Ayeka and didn't miss) Hahaha!!!
Ayeka: (Falls and lands on her butt) Owwwww!!!! Oh that Ryoko's going to
pay!!! (Starts to brush off the dust from her butt)
Tenchi: Princess Ayeka?
Ayeka: (Immediately stands up and turns red) Oh... (Giggles nervously) I
didn't hear you coming, Lord Tenchi... (Giggles nervously again)
Tenchi: Well, your sister requests for you.
Ayeka: (Stops giggling) Oh well, what does she need?
Tenchi: I don't remember. I think it's something about your dress.
Ayeka: Oh why yes lord Tenchi. (Starts to walk but starts to fake a limp)
Tenchi: Oh! Do you need any help?
Ayeka: Why, yes. Thank you lord Tenchi... (Looks back at Ryoko and
devilishly grins. Then looks back at Tenchi and helplessly smiles)
Ryoko: You just wait princess...........you just wait!

(Back in the house, Sasami is desperately trying to sew a large rip on the
back of one of Ayeka's dress)

Ayeka: Yes, Sasami. What is it?
Sasami: Oh I dropped this dress on accident I swear!
Ayeka: Oh Sasami! That's one of mother's dresses you know that.
Sasami: I know. And I'm really sorry Ayeka. It was an accident.
Ayeka: (Sits down close to Sasami) You need to be more careful Sasami. Now,
give me a needle and a thread and I'll help you.
Sasami: (Hands a needle and thread) Thank you, Ayeka.... Sister!

(In Washu's laboratory)

Washu: (On her computer glances at the screen with a devilish grin on her
face) Ha! Ha! I'm almost done! Just a little bit more.............
Ryoko: WASHU!!! (Slams the door open)
Washu: (Pushes wrong key and the computer screen says failure. Washu's gets
an angry look on her face) WHAT IS IT!!!!!!!
Ryoko: (Cools down) What's your problem???
Washu: (Says while teeth are clenched) I was this close to making a new life
form!!! (Opens her mouth) Until you butted in!!!
Ryoko: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyways.........I need help.
Washu: (Sits back on her chair) Why should I help you?
Ryoko: I have my reasons...please
Washu: (Folds her arms) What's the magic word?..........
Ryoko: Honestly...do I have to-
Washu: (Interrupts) Yes.... or I won't help you
Ryoko: Please... (Sighs, and starts to grumble) mom
Washu: Please.........whom???
Ryoko: MOM!!!!!! There.........you happy now?
Washu: (Giggles) I suppose. Now, what do you need help in?
Ryoko: Just a little- (Whispers in Washu's ear)
(From the back of Washu's lab, they hear)
Uzuko: Uh... GET ME OUT OF HERE!!! TTTHHHIIIISSS RRREEEAAALLLLYYYY
HHHUUURRRRRTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryoko: What the?
Washu: Oh, don't worry about him.

Tenchi: Sasami, did you and Ayeka finish sewing up that dress?
Sasami: Yes
Tenchi: Oh, that was fast.
Sasami: Ayeka knows more about sewing dresses than I do. And she's pretty
good.
Tenchi: That's nice-
(All of a sudden Ayeka rushes in breathless and Ryoko follows right behind
her)
Ayeka: (Hiding behind Tenchi) GET AWAY YOU BEAST!!!
Ryoko: (Giggling) Why? Are you afraid little princess? Too bad your guards
can't protect you. Hahaha! (Makes a weird blue fire ball) Take this! (All of
a sudden it's stopped by Tenchi. Fireball diminishes)
Tenchi: (Yelling at Ryoko) RYOKO!!!!
Ryoko: (Stops making a fireball) Oh Tenchi I was just trying to get her away
so we can get back to our sweet romance.
Tenchi: (Blushes) What romance?
Ayeka: YES!!! WHAT ROMANCE!?!?!!?
Tenchi: Ryoko?
Ryoko: (Her new powers vanish) Oh darn. Well princess. You're safe
now...(Then disappears)
Ayeka: (mumbling to herself) Oh I hate that demon!
Tenchi: Huh? What did you say Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: Wha-? Oh, nothing lord Tenchi.
Tenchi: Oh, okay.
Ayeka: Lord Tenchi...
Sasami: (Yells) Time for Dinner!
Tenchi: Okay!

(A couple hours later when Tenchi is at the fields, a strange, yet cute
looking stranger is near)

Tenchi: (Leaning on the rake) Shucks, I'm so tired. I can't go on.
????: Pardon me.
Tenchi: Ryoko I told you a million times I- (Gasped and looked at the
beautiful girl and nods. She has silver hair that is half pony tailed and
down. Her silver eyes are glowing because of the night) Y-yes.
????: good evening, I am Marasuki. Is there a Washu in this area?
Tenchi: Y-yes. W-what do y-you want?
Marasukie: Will you please show me in the direction where I may find her?
Tenchi: (Points to the house) T-there...
Marasuki: Thank you. I am very grateful. (Bows down and leaves)
Tenchi: (Thinks to himself: Wow. She's cute.)
Marasuki: (Thinks to herself: He might be a man from this planet... But I
find him quite handsome, than the other boys at the Space Academy.)
Mihoshi: (Peeling potatoes) Oh Ayeka, isn't this fun?
Ayeka: Hardly... Hey, do you know where Uzuko is? I didn't see him at
dinner.
Marasuki: Good evening.
Ayeka: (Still peeling a potato) Huh? (Looks upward and gasped. Thinks to
herself: Great, competition greater than Ryoko. I hope she hasn't seen
Tenchi yet... Or Uzuko...)
Mihoshi: Hi! Umm, do you need anything?
Marasuki: Yes. My name is Marasuki, and I am in search for Washu.
Mihoshi: Okay. I'll show you. Follow me!
Marasuki: Thank you
Mihoshi: (Knocks on the door) Washu! There's someone here to see you!

(The door opens and Marasuki thanks Mihoeshi once again)

Mihoshi: Yep! No prob.
Ryoko: Who's the babe, blondie?
Mihoshi: Oh that's Marasuki. A visitor for Washu.
Ryoko: Okay. (Thinks to herself: she better be visiting Washu than MY
Tenchi)
Washu: (Looking at her computer) Yes? What is it?
Marasuki: Are you the great scientist Washu?
Washu: (Stops typing then giggles) Why, yes. How may I help you?
Marasuki: Were you trying to make a new life form earlier on?
Washu: (Turns around and looks) Yes. How do you know that?
Marasuki: Well, my computer picked up the signal and I completed it for you
Washu: Someone as smart as me, eh? Well..................?
Marasuki: Well, I wouldn't call me that smart... (Blushes)
Washu: Well now, may I see?
Marasuki: Oh, yes. (But gets distracted by a yell)
Uzuko: HEY, MA!!!!
Washu: Huh?
Uzuko: GET ME OUT OF THIS THINNGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Marasuki: What- who is that?
Washu: Haha! Oh don't worry... it's just my son.
Marasuki: Your... son?
Washu: Yup!
Uzuko: MMMMAAAAAAAA!!!!! YOU SAID THE TESTING WAS DONE!!! GET MMMMEEEEE
OOOOOOUUUUUTTTT!!!!
Washu: (Opens the door to a device) Marasuki... this is Uzuko.
Uzuko: (Didn't notice they were there) MAAA- (Opens his eyes) Huh?! Whoa...
(Looks at Marasuki)
Washu: Uzuko, this is Marasuki.
Marasuki: (Wow... He's cuter than the other boy I saw... But looks like the
girl with the green hair) Hello...(Looks downwards) 'Gasp!' (Turns around
quickly with a red face)
Uzuko: Uh... (Looks down at his body. Thinks: DAMN!! I see a REALLY cute
girl while I'm-I'm... NAKED!!! Turns COMPLETELY red)
Washu: Hahaha!!!! Oh my, my... I forgot I took off your clothes!
Uzuko: SHUT UP!!! (Disappears to his room)
Marasuki: He can disappear?
Washu: Hahaha- Huh? Oh yes he can. But, I put a barrier around him so he
won't.
Marasuki: Why?
Washu: He usually doesn't want me to test him. I kinda forced him in there.
(Points at the device)
Marasuki: (Thinks: Poor guy...) I feel sorry for him.
Washu: Don't be! He deserves it! Anyway, may I see what you have completed?
Marasuki: Oh, yes! (Takes out her computer)

(In Uzuko's room)

Uzuko: (Pulling up his pants. Thinks: Damn Washu!!!!! Hears a knock on his
door)  Huh? (Opens the door)
Sasami: Hi Uzuko! Where were you at dinner?
Uzuko: Oh Sasami!......I was at Washu's lab.
Sasami: Oh... Are you okay?
Uzuko: ............ No... I'm hungry...
Sasami: Good! I saved some dinner for you! Mihoshi!
Uzuko: Hahaha! (Picks up Sasami and puts her on his shoulders) You're
greatest Mother I'd ever had!
Sasami: (Giggles) I'm not your Mother!
Uzuko: You sure act like it! (Puts Sasami down)
Mihoshi: Here's your food!
Sasami: Hope you like it! (Blushes)
Uzuko: I know I will. You're the best cook I've ever met!
Sasami: (Giggles) Thanks Uzuko!
Ayeka: (Walks up the stairs) Oh, Uzuko! Where were you at dinner?
Uzuko: (Munching on his food) Huh? Oh... Washu wanted me as guinea pig...
again... (Starts to eat again)
Ayeka: Oh, I see...
Mihoshi: Did she do anything that hurt you? I didn't hear you scream at all.
Uzuko: (Stops eating again) Of course she did! But she did put me in this
container-thing. So, when I screamed, someone in the lab would only hear.
(Starts to eat again)
Ayeka: Oh, did you see anyone NEW?
Uzuko: Yea, some REALLY cute babe, why? (Starts to eat)
Ayeka: (Thinks: Ba-ba-babe?) Oh... (Walks to her room angrily)
Uzuko: Huh? (Looks at Sasami) Did I say something wrong?
Sasami: (Shrugs her shoulders) I don't know...
Mihoshi: I think she's jealous.
Ayeka: (Yelling from her room) I AM NOT JEALOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uzuko: You have a VERY weird sister.
Sasami: Not as weird as yours.
Uzuko: You have a point.
Sasami: By the way, have you seen Ryoko? She was supposed to wash the
dishes?
Uzuko: I don't know... She might be TRYING to seduce Tenchi... (Starts
eating) Poor guy...
Mihoshi: She's thinking about that? Oh my!...
Sasami: When will she stop?
Uzuko: (Shrugs his shoulders)

(At Washu's Lab)

Washu: Wow! Just amazing!
Marasuki: It's absolutely spectacular! And it looks so cute!!!!!
Washu: (Picks up the specimen. Rubs her nose against it) you're going to
become my son's pet!
Marasuki: What shall you name it Miss Washu?
Washu: Hmmm... Since it's a Chu-Chu... I'll name it... I'll name it...
????: Ken-chu!!
Washu: Wha?
????: Ken-chu! Name me Ken-chu!!
Marasuki: That's an adorable name for it!
Washu: I guess, since you want it so much.
Ken-chu: Meow! That's great!
Washu: Good! Now I'll let you meet your master!
Ken-chu: Master?
Marasuki: (Speaks in Washu's ears) I don't think its wise to call Uzuko its
master...
Washu: Huh?
Marasukie: It might get offended...
Ken-chu: OFFENDED??!!! Of course I'll get OFFENDED!! Why do I have to have a
master?!
Washu: You are his spaceship.
Ken-chu: I'm a Spaceship? (Tilt its head) Oh boy...
Washu: All you have to do is turn to his Spaceship when he asks you. You
don't have to be his slave or anything.
Ken-chu: If that's the case, then yes! I'll be his Spaceship!
Marasuki: (Giggles. Puts her hand to her mouth) It's just the cutest thing!!
Washu: UZUKO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
.................................... Where is that boy?
UUUUUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUKKKKKKKKKKKKOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(Suddenly Uzuko appears in front of them)
Uzuko: 'Yawns' what do you want?
Ken-chu: Who's that idiot?
Uzuko: Who's that fur ball? (Points at Ken-chu)
Ken-chu: Who you calling a fur ball, (Looks at Uzuko's ears) Elf boy!
Uzuko: At least I'm not little like you.
Ken-chu: AND at least I'm not as STUPID as you!
Uzuko: WHAT?! Why you little-
Washu: He's your Spaceship.
Uzuko: Gee, aren't I lucky.
Ken-chu: You mean this doof balls MY master?
Marasuki: Stop fighting you two!
Uzuko: (Thinks: Hey, its the pretty girl) Don't tell me you woke me up for
this?
Ken-chu: Well, they did! (Jumps on Uzuko's head. Looks at his face) you
better not treat me like a slave or else!
Uzuko: Or else what?
Ken-chu: THIS!!! (Jumps high in the air and stomps HARD on Uzuko head)
Uzuko: OW!!!!! (Falls on the ground with Ken-chu on his face)
Marasuki: Ken-chu you shouldn't jump so high in the air! You might hurt
yourself! (Picks up Ken-chu)
Uzuko: Oh, worry about the dumb fur ball when I'm the one that got hurt...
Marasuki: Huh? Oh you can take care of yourself. He was just created a few
minutes ago!
Uzuko: Uh... Everyone hates me for some reason...
Ken-chu: That's for sure!
Uzuko: Ah, shut up. (Throws a LITTLE energy ball at Ken-chu)
Ken-chu: (Hits Ken-chu) HEY!!!!!!!!!
Marasuki: Hey, Uzuko!!!!!!
Uzuko: (Devilishly laughs then disappears to his room)
Ken-chu: WHAT????????????!!!!!!!! Where he go to?!?!?!?
Washu: He disappeared again...
Ken-chu: Disappeared? (Tilts its head)
Marasuki: 'Sighs' (Still holding Ken-chu) I wonder where to...
Ken-chu: Maybe went off to cry!
Washu: Hahaha!!! Cute... and funny!!! Hahaha!!!
Marasuki: (Looks down) I was hoping he'd stay here awhile... 'Gasps' (Covers
her mouth. Thinks: What am I saying?)
Ken-chu: (Looks at her with a strange look) SAY WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!
Marasuki: (Blushes) Ummm... I- I- didn't say anything!
Ken-chu: But I was sure-
Marasuki: Miss Washu!
Washu: Yes?
Marasuki: What shall I do now?
Washu: You can stay here if you want.
Marasuki: Really? I appreciate your offer... (Hands Ken-chu to Washu)
Ken-chu: 'Yawns' Hey, I'm sleepy... where do I sleep?
Washu: Ummm... Sleep with Uzuko.
Ken-chu: WHAT?!?!?!?!?!
Washu: I'll take you to his room...
Ken-chu: I rather have fleas then sleep with him!
Washu: Close enough!
Ken-chu: Why can't Marasuki sleep with him!!!!!!!
Marasuki: (Blushes) I can't! It's very wrong for a boy and girl to sleep
together!
Ken-chu: And it's very GAY for a Chu-chu to sleep with an IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!
Washu: (Teardrop) Quit complaining and let's go! (Goes outside the door and
starts walking upstairs)
Ken-chu: NO!!! DON'T DO THIS TO ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Washu: (Stops) SSSSHHHHH!!! You might wake the others!
Marasuki: I wonder... Where do I sleep?



(Next morning)

Uzuko: 'Yawns' (Opens eyes) Hmmm? Is it just me or do I feel fur on my legs?
(Takes off his blanket to see Ken-chu sleeping between his legs)
Ken-chu: Good-morning ELF BOY!!!!!!!
Uzuko: AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Ken-chu: AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Uzuko: What the hell are you doing here!?!??!?!?!?!
Ken-chu: I don't know... You tell me!!!!!!!!
Uzuko: Uh... GGEEETTT OOOUUUTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Picks up
Ken-chu and opens the door)
Ken-chu: LET GO OF ME YOU JERK!!!!!! LLLEEETT MMMEE
GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uzuko:  Ah, shut up!!!
Ayeka: (Walks out of her room) What's all this noise- Oh my!! What's that?
Uzuko: An annoying PEST!!!
Ken-chu: (Looks at Uzuko) Oh, am I? (Bites Uzuko's hand)
Uzuko: (A beam of pain goes through his head) OOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!
(Drops Ken-chu)
Ayeka: Mr. Uzuko!
Uzuko: WHY YOU LITTLE!!!!!!!!
Ken-chu: (Jumps into Ayeka arms) Take that you IDIOT!!!!!!!!!
Uzuko: YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (His hand is bleeding)
Marasuki: (Walks up stairs) Ken-chu!!! (Looks at Uzuko's hand) Your hand!
Uzuko: (Looks at his hand) NOW YOU'RE REALLY GONNA PAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ken-chu: (Still in Ayeka's arms. Sticks out his tongue)
Uzuko: UURRRGGHHH!!!!!!!!!! YOUR-
Marasuki: (Walks up to Uzuko. Takes his hand) It's bleeding...
Uzuko: Uh... Yeah... I know.
Marasuki: (Looks at Uzuko) It doesn't look to bad... come with me to Miss
Washu's lab.
Uzuko: WHA-?!?! NOOOOOOO!!!!
Marasuki: (Pulls Uzuko down stairs) Don't be a child about it! She won't
hurt her own son!
Uzuko: Oh, SURE she won't...
Marasukie: (Giggles) Come on... it won't be so bad...
Uzuko: Believe me, if you know my ma as well as I do... it will hurt! IT
WILL HURT!!!!!
Ken-chu: Thing is, NO ONE BELIEVES YOU ANYWAY!!!!!!!!
Uzuko: YOU SHUT UP NO ONE WAS SPEAKING TO YOU!!!!!!
Ken-chu: OH YEAH WELL-
Marasuki: Will you two quit!!! Lets go!!! (Knocks on the lab door) Miss
Washu!!! We have a guest!
(The lab door swings open)
Ken-chu: (Hopping down the stairs) Hey! Wait up Marasuki!
Marasuki: (Turns around) Ken-chu! You naughty little thing! (Opens her arms)
Ken-chu: (Hops into her arms) I'm not that naughty...
Marasuki: You shouldn't have done that to Uzuko...
Ken-chu: He deserved it!
Uzuko: Why the heck do I deserved that, you peep-squeak!!!!!
Ken-chu: BECAUSE!!!!!!!!!!
Washu: Yes what is it?
Marasuki: (Puts Ken-chu down. Lifts Uzuko's bleeding hand gently) He's
bleeding...
Uzuko: Your STUPID creation bit me!
Ken-chu: I am NOT a STUPID creation!!!
Uzuko: You wanna make a bet on that?!?!?!
Ken-chu: How about another BITE on that!!!!!!
Marasuki: (Picks up Ken-chu) You've done enough damage on him for today...
Ken-chu: I'm just getting started!!!
Washu: Hmmm... I need an anti-infection spray, just in case. (A spray bottle
appears) This will do! (Sprays on Uzuko's hand)
Uzuko: OOOOOOWWWWWW!!! THAT STINGS!!!!
Ken-chu: My so-called 'Master' cries like a baby!!!
Ayeka: (Walks in the lab) Ummm... I hope I'm not disturbing you...
Washu: Oh! Not at all Ayeka!!! (Finishes wrapping a bandage on Uzuko's hand)
Uzuko: (Blows on his hand) How did I get stuck with a pathetic fur ball like
you?
Ayeka: How's your hand Mr. Uzuko.
Uzuko: (Walks to Ayeka and stands NEAR her) It's fine... well now at least.
Ayeka: (Nervously smiles) Oh really?
Marasuki: (Thinks: Huh? Is Mr. Uzuko with that girl over there? I-I-I hope
not...) So, Mr. Uzuko?
Uzuko: (Turns around) Yes, Miss Marasuki?
Marasuki: Uh...  (Thinks: What do I say? 'Gasp' I know!) Can you show me
around this place?
Uzuko: Uhhh... Sure, I'd love to! (Walks to Marasuki and offers his arm)
Marasukie: (Puts her arm around his. Giggles nervously) Thank you...
Ken-chu: Oh, A REAL lady's man... (In a dull voice) My hero...
Ayeka: (Turns red with envy. Thinks: What is she doing!)
Ken-chu: (Looks at Ayeka) What the-? Why are you turning red!? Is it because
Marasuki and Uzu-
Ayeka: (Covers Ken-chu's mouth) Quiet!
Uzuko: (With Marasuki around his arm. Goes outside) Uhhh... This is outside
the lab...
Marasuki: You're not a real good tour guide, are you?
Uzuko: Hey, I've only been here for a month. So far, I've only seen the
lab...
Marasuki: Hahaha!
(Suddenly Tenchi comes out of the kitchen)
Tenchi: (Thinks: Hey, it's the girl I saw) Ummm... Hi!
(Both turn around)
Uzuko: Hey Tenchi. Oh! Marasukie, this is Tenchi.
Marasuki: (Lends out her hand) Nice to meet you again Tenchi.
Tenchi: My pleasure... (Shakes hands) Marasukie... right?
Marasuki: (Nods her head) Uzuko's showing me around... (Looks at Uzuko and
smiles)
Uzuko: Uhhh... (Blushes)
Tenchi: Hahaha! Seems like you got another fan!
Marasuki: (Turns COMPLETELY red) WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSE TO MEAN?!?!?! (Lets go
of Uzuko arm)
Tenchi: No-nothing at all... (Runs back in the kitchen)
Uzuko: (Blushes) Uhhh... sorry about that.
Marasuki: (Looks down) It's okay... (Looks at Uzuko and blushes) But will
you still show me around?
Uzuko: I don't know... Where do you wanna go first?
Marasuki: Uh, how do I know? I'm not sure WHERE to go!
Uzuko: Well... there's always the-
Mihoshi: Uzuko! There you are! I've been looking all over for you! (Hugs
him)
Uzuko: HEY!
Mihoshi: (Giggles) Oh sorry! (Stops hugging)
Marasuki: Uh... Hello.
Mihoshi: Oh, you're the girl I've met from yesterday! My name is Mihoshi!
Marasuki: Pleasure to meet you again... I am Marasuki. Uzuko is showing me
around.
Mihoshi: How nice!!! But... sorry I can't come, Sasami needs help in the
kitchen.
Sasami: Mihoshi! You said you'd help me! Mihoshi! (Walks outside) Oh! Hello
Uzuko! Uhhh... (Looks at Marasuki)
Mihoshi: This is Sasami...
Marasuki: Hello Sasami! My name is Marasuki...
Sasami: So you're the pretty girl Uzuko was mumbling about!
Marasuki: Wha-? (Blushes)
Uzuko: W-what are you t-talking about... Sasami?
Sasami: You were mumbling about a pretty girl that you saw in the lab when I
gave you your dinner last night.
(Uzuko and Marasuki both turn completely red)
Sasami: 'Gasp.' Oh! Sorry! Ummm... (Looks at Mihoshi and nervously laughs)
Come on Mihoshi! We'd better get dinner ready... (Grabs Mihoshi by the arm)
Mihoshi: Have fun!
Uzuko: (Being sarcastic while mumbling) Oh I'm sure I'll have fun...
(Thinks: Now that she knows I think she's pretty...)
Marasuki: What did you say? (Turns around)
Uzuko: (Scratches his head and looks down) 'sigh' nothing...
Marasuki: (Looks down) If you don't want to show me around anymore today...
you don't have to...
Uzuko: No, I still want to!
Marasuki: (Smiles a REALLY cute smile) Thank you.
Uzuko: (Blushes) Hahaha... Come on, I'll show you Tenchi's Grandfather's
Shrine. (Offers his arms)
Marasuki: I can't wait to meet him!
Uzuko: He's okay... for an old guy...
Marasuki: Uzuko!
Uzuko: Hahahaha!!! I'm just joking! This way... (Points to the trail)
(After a few minutes)
Marasuki: That wasn't very long...
Uzuko: Just need to go up the stairs...
(All of a sudden Ryoko appears in front of them)

Ryoko: Hello brother... and... umm...(Looks at Marasuki)
Uzuko: Oh no... what do you want now!
Marasuki: (Let's go of his arm)
Ryoko: (While in mid air Ryoko circles Marasuki) Just wanting to check out
your new GIRLFRIEND!!!
Uzuko: Don't be stupid... wait a minute, you already are!
Ryoko: (Stops circling Marasuki) Just SHUT UP!!!!! Ummm... So you're not
after Tenchi, are you? (Looks at Marasuki)
Marasuki: What are you talking about?
Uzuko: Oh great...
Ryoko: Shut up! As I was saying, do you think Tenchi's cute or not?
Marasuki: Huh? I don't understand why you're so pessimistic of me thinking
Tenchi's cute or not.
Ryoko: JUST ANSWER ME!!!!!
Uzuko: Ugh... Good BYE Ryoko! (Takes Marasuki hand and disappears)
Ryoko: HHHHHHHEEEEEEYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(At Lord Yosho's Shrine)

(Uzuko & Marasuki appears in front of the shrine)
Marasuki: Whoa...
Uzuko: You all right?
Marasuki: Huh? Oh yes I'm fine... Why did you that, Uzuko?
Uzuko: I don't want Ryoko all over you asking about Tenchi. I already had
enough...
Marasuki: What do mean?
Uzuko: Ryoko and Ayeka ALWAYS fight about who has Tenchi... Even Washu and
Mihoshi join in... It really ANNOYS me...
Marasuki: You mean you're not with Ayeka?
Uzuko: Wha-what? (Turns red) O-of course n-not!!
Marasuki: (Thinks: He's blushing... Does that mean he LIKES Ayeka?)
Do...you...like...Ayeka?
Uzuko: (Turns COMPLETELY red) Ummm... I... like her as a friend... but,
nothing else... (Looks away)
Marasuki: (Thinks: Why doesn't he look at me? Is he lying to me?) Oh...
Uzuko: Why?... uh, do you ask?
Marasuki: (Shakes her head) Just wondering... (Thinks: Why would he like
that GIRL?)
Uzuko: Uh... okay... do you like Tenchi? (Thinks: I hope she doesn't)
Marasuki: WHAT!!! (Turns red) Of course NOT!!!
Yosho: (Coming out with a broom) Giving respects to the shrine? Hmmm...
aren't you Ryoko's brother?
Uzuko: Yes sir. (Bows down)
Yosho: (Looks behind Uzuko) Who is that lovely lady behind you?
Uzuko: (Takes Marasuki by the hand and introduces her) This is Marasuki...
Marasuki: Good evening sir (Bows down)
Yosho: I partly overheard your conversation. (Thinks: Okay... your whole
conversation)
Uzuko: Uh... You did? (Thinks: Great...)
Marasuki: (Blushes) Well.................... Mr. Uzuko is showing me around!
Uzuko: Yeah, ummmmm... Why don't you tell her about the Masaki Shrine?
Yosho: Oh all right. (Walks them to the door) Why don't we sit inside?
(All of them you inside. They all sit down)
Yosho: According to a legend, 700 years ago, a demon came to this earth. It
made the people in this land suffer, for it destroyed everything in its
path. But then, a dragon from the sky came to save the people from the
hideous demon. He took his mighty sword and sealed the demon in the Masaki
Shrine. That man was an ancestor of Tenchi...
Uzuko: AND that man was-
Marasuki: Wow that's amazing... So that was the history of this Shrine?
Uzuko: HEY!
Marasuki: Oh sorry! (Blushes and gives another CUTE smile)
Uzuko: (Blushes) Uhhh... it's okay...
Yosho: Hahaha! A very cute couple you two make.
Uzuko & Marasuki: (Turns COMPLETEY red) we do not!!!
Yosho: Hahaha!
Uzuko: As I was saying, that man was you, wasn't Lord Yosho?
Yosho: (Clears his throat)
Marasuki: But, that was 700 years ago...
Yosho: Yes, that man was me... But-
Uzuko: Okay, let's go!
Marasuki: (Teardrop) Let him finish!
Uzuko: Hey, you want me to show around right?
Marasuki: Yes...
Uzuko: Then I'll this need to show you his Space Tree!
Yosho: Hahaha! Don't worry; what I was going to say wasn't important. Just
go on your tour and I'll be fine.
Marasukie: Are you sure?
Uzuko: Okay, NOW let's go...
(Grabs Marasuki by the hand and runs down the stairs)
Marasuki: (Yells while waving) BYE!!! TAKE CARE!!! (Looks at Uzuko) Isn't
there a quicker way down?
Uzuko: Yep! (Disappears with Marasuki)
(Appear at the bottom of the stairs)
Marasuki: (Turns around and looks at the stairs) That was a LONG way down...
Uzuko: (Lets go of her hand) Yeah... no big deal. Come on! I'll show you
Yosho's space tree.
Marasuki: Ummm.... All right. (Follows behind Uzuko) Where is it located?
Uzuko: Somewhere nearby... don't remember exactly...
Marasuki: (Teardrop)
Uzuko: But it's close...
Marasuki: I hope you're correct...

(Back at the house)

Ayeka: (Thinks: I wonder what's taking them so long...)
Sasami: Hahaha!! You two are so cute!!
Ryo-ohki: Reow!!
Ken-chu: Meow!! Let's play a game!
Sasami: What do you wanna play?
Ayeka: Sasami!
Sasami: (Looks at Ayeka) Yes, Sister?
Ayeka: (Stands up) 'Want to' not 'wanna'!! It is improper to say 'wanna'!
Ken-chu: Why is it improper to say 'wanna'?
Sasami: Because that's not how princesses say 'want to'...
Ryo-ohki: Reow...
Ayeka: Ugh... (Walks outside)
Ken-chu: Why is SHE so mad?
Sasami: (Shrugs her shoulders) I don't know...

(Outside)

Ayeka: Where are they?
Tenchi: Huh? (Sweeping the floor with a broom) Where are who, Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: Huh? Oh Lord Tenchi!
(Suddenly Ryoko appears in front of them)
Ryoko: (Hands are across her chest. Grumbles) Stupid Uzuko...
Ayeka: Huh? (In a dull voice) oh, it's you...
Ryoko: (In mid air. Knocks Ayeka over) TENCHI!!!!!
Tenchi: Miss Ayeka!!!!
Ayeka: (Sits up and yells) WHY DON'T YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryoko: I thought princesses knew better, I guess YOU don't... Anyways, do
you KNOW what your BOYFRIEND was doing TODAY???
Ayeka: What boyfriend?!?! (Blushes)
Tenchi: Huh?
Ryoko: (Devilishly smiles) Well now, are you telling you DON'T care if Uzuko
HELD Marasuki TIGHTLY????
Ayeka: Wha-wha-what?
Ryoko: Well princess, there were actually......... FLIRTING!!! (Devilishly
laughs) AND he also seemed to ENJOY it!!!!
Ayeka: (Turns red) LIKE I EVEN CCCAARRRREEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Walks to the
forest. Thinks: Like I even care who Uzuko flirts with!!!!!!!!)
Ryoko: HAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!
Tenchi: MISS AYEKA!!! .................. (Looks at Ryoko) RYOKO!!!!!
Ryoko: Yes Tenchi?
Tenchi: I can't believe you!
Ryoko: What, Tenchi?
Tenchi: Yo-you didn't have to tell her that!
Ryoko: Why not? It WAS the truth. (Looks away)
Tenchi: No it wasn't! Uzuko would be to darn shy to do that!!!
Ryoko: But Tenchi! I only said that so we could be together.... Tenchi.
(Flies to Tenchi and wraps herself around him)
Tenchi: Will you stop that! Honestly!
Ryoko: (Lands on her feet and whispers in his ear) You know wanted me too.
So why fight it?
Tenchi: Wha- what?!?
Ryoko: (Giggles then disappears)

(In the forest)

Ayeka: (Near Yosho's Space Tree. Thinks: That Ryoko!! She me so mad!!!!!!!!)
Marasuki: WOW!!!!! This place is so pretty!
Uzuko: I knew you'd like it.
Marasuki: The Lake is really lovely... (Bends down and touches the water)
Uzuko: (Blushes. Thinks: Not as lovely as you...) Yeah, well... Lord Yosho
take really good care of this place...
Ayeka: Huh? (Bends down over some bushes... Think: It's Uzuko!!! Now I can
see if Ryoko's right)
Uzuko: (Thinks: She's so pretty... Stares at Marasuki)
Marasuki: (Notices. Thinks: What is Uzuko doing?) Huh? What are staring at,
Uzuko? (Starts to walk to Uzuko)
Uzuko: (Blushes) No-nothing...
Marasuki: (Giggles. But then trips) Whoa! (Falls in Uzuko's arms)
Uzuko: Are you all right?
Marasuki: Yea...
(They look straight in each other's eyes)
Ayeka: (Starts to cry a little. Thinks: Uzuko... No it can't be true!)
Uzuko: Uh...
Marasuki: Yes?
Uzuko: I-I t-think you-u- or do-o y-you need help-p in g-getting u-p? (Turns
red)
Marasuki: Oh! (Gets up from his arms and turns around)
Ayeka: (Thinks: Urrr...THAT DREADFUL GIRL!!! Turns red with envy)
Marasuki: Uh... How should we get home?
Uzuko: Whaddya mean?
Marasuki: You kinda got us lost here...
Uzuko: Hey!! I got you here didn't I?!?!?!
Marasuki: (Giggles) You did... In three hours...
Uzuko: Uh...
Marasuki: And it might take us longer to get home...
Uzuko: (Thinks: Damn... She's right... No, wait!) I could just teleport us
there.
Marasuki: I know... But why didn't you teleport us here?
Uzuko: Umm... Because I wanted you to see the scenery!!!!
Marasuki: Sure you did! (Starts laughing)
Uzuko: (Blushes) I did! I REALLY did!!!!!!!
Ayeka: (Starts to giggle softy. Thinks: He's such a child!)
Marasuki: Oh Uzuko... (Looks at him) Just take us home...
Uzuko: 'Sigh.' Fine, fine... (Takes her by the hand) Lets go...
Marasuki: (Faces Uzuko) Thank you for being kind enough to show me around...
Uzuko: (Blushes) Uhhh... yeah, sure! (Thinks: Gosh, she's so pretty)
Marasuki: (Thinks: He's kinda' cute...there is something about him that
makes me-...)
Uzuko: Should we get going now?
Marasukie: What? Oh... yes, I think we should.
(Both Disappear)
Ayeka: (Thinks: That Ryoko!!!! She wasn't right... was she? They did seem
like they were flirting... kinda... Ugh... I'll worry about it later. I must
get home. Walks back to the house)

(Back at the house)

Sasami: Ken-chu! Ryo-ohki!
Ryo-ohki: Reow!
Ken-chu: Meow!
Sasami: It's almost dinnertime! Can you call everyone?
Ken-chu: OOOOKKKAAAAYYY!!! Come on Ryo-ohki!
Ryo-ohki: Reow!!!
(Ken-chu and Ryo-ohki run outside to get Tenchi and Ryoko, when all of a
sudden Uzuko and Marasuki appear not to far from them)
Ken-chu: What the-? Marasuki! (Jumps in Marasuki's arms)
Uzuko: Oh it's you...
Marasuki: (Giggles while Ken-chu is in her arms)
Ken-chu: Shut up! I don't know why Marasuki ASKED you to show her around!
You're just a big-
Uzuko: (Picks up Ken-chu) Say one more thing and I'll-
Tenchi: Umm... Where's Ayeka, Uzuko?
(Ken-chu wiggles out of Uzuko grasp)
Uzuko: (Looks at Tenchi) Huh? I thought she was over here?
Tenchi: (Shakes his head)
Ryoko: She went straight in the forest after I told her what happened
between you two. (Devilishly smiles)
Marasuki: What do you mean?
Ryoko: Oh, you don't know? (Smiles innocently) Y'know...
Marasuki: Urrr... I most certainly do NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryoko: Oh, come on now! Don't play dumb with me-
Uzuko: (Hits Ryoko on the head) Just shut up! I'm gonna go find her, all
right. (Disappears)
(From the kitchen they hear)
Sasami: IT DINNER TIME!
Ken-chu: Let's eat!
Ryo-ohki: Reow! (Nods her head)
(Ayeka comes out of the forest)
Ayeka: (Breathes heavily) I made it time for dinner!
Ryoko: (In a dull voice) Whoopie...
Ayeka: Oh shut up!
Marasuki: Hello, Miss Ayeka.
Ayeka: (Thinks: Oh it's her...) H-hello... (Quickly turns away from
Marasuki) Where is Uzuko?
Tenchi: I told him you were in forest...
Marasuki: He went looking for you Miss Ayeka.
Ayeka: He did?
Ken-chu: Not because he LIKES you or anything...
Ayeka: Urrr... Oh, be quiet!
Ryo-ohki: Reow... (Looks at the forest)
Ken-chu: What's the matter Ryo-ohki?
Ryo-ohki: Reow, Reow...
Ken-chu: Ah, don't worry about him. He can survive a day without dinner,
right?
Ryo-ohki: (Shrugs her shoulders) Reow.
Ken-chu: Oh well... He's a man, right? Well... close to one at least...
(Everyone goes inside)

(After dinner)

Marasuki: That was the most superb dinner I'd had in ages!
Ayeka: (Mumbles) Oh, so you're saying your old?
Marasuki: WHAT?!!
Ayeka: Nothing...
Ryoko: That was...was...
Washu: Since you can't taste anything, you might as well say it was good!
Ryoko: HEY!! You're the one who MADE me this way!!!!!!!!!
Washu: Oh yea, huh...
Tenchi: Let's stop fighting already.
Mihoshi: That was really good Sasami! Can I have more rice, please?
Sasami: Sure, Mihoshi!
Marasuki: Hey, but shouldn't we save some for Uzuko?
Ken-chu: Why? He doesn't have to eat EVERYDAY, does he?
Marasuki: 'Sighs'
(Suddenly Uzuko appears in front of them)
Uzuko: AYEKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHERE THE HECK WERE YOU IN THE DAMN
FOREST?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Ayeka: Uh...
Ken-chu: She got out of the forest when you left.
Ryo-ohki: Reow...  (Nods her head)
Uzuko: SO I'D LOOKED AROUND FOR HER LIKE A-
Ken-chu: Idiot?
Uzuko: SHUT UP!!!!!!!!
Marasuki: Calm down now Uzuko!
Ryoko: Don't get so worked up because you couldn't eat any dinner!
Uzuko: Whaddya mean?!
Ken-chu: We ate it all.
Uzuko: YOU WHAT?!
Sasami: I'm sorry Uzuko... I didn't get to save any food this time...
Marasuki: I'll feed you.
Uzuko: Wha?
Marasuki: You're acting like a child about this. Just eat the rest of my
food.
Uzuko: Are you sure?
Ayeka: (Starts to bite her spoon REALLY hard. Turns red with envy. Thinks:
WHAT ON EARTH IS SHE DOING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Marasuki: (Nods her head) I'm quite sure...
Uzuko: (Looks at her plate hungrily) Ummm... okay! (Eats REALLY fast and
sloppy)
Marasuki: (Teardrop) Boy! He eats pretty fast!
Ken-chu: What a pig!!! Hope he chokes!!!!!
Uzuko: (Stops eating) Shut up PEEP-SQUEAK! (Starts eating, but not too fast)
Ayeka: Ugh... (Stands up and starts walking to the kitchen)
Marasuki: Miss Ayeka? Is something wrong?
Ayeka: HUMPH!!!!!!!! (Stomps in anger into the kitchen)
Marasuki: (Looks at everyone else) Why is Miss Ayeka mad?
Washu: I'm sure she's not...
Tenchi: I hope so...
Sasami: Me too...
Mihoshi: Are you sure? She sure did seem mad.
Ryoko: Ah, she's just being herself...
Ken-chu: You mean she ALWAYS act like a hag?
Ryo-ohki: Reow! (Shakes her head)
Ken-chu: Oh, okay.
Ayeka: (Sticks out her head of the kitchen door) JUST SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!
(Throws something at Ken-chu)
(Ken-chu falls on the ground)
Ken-chu: Ow...
Marasuki: (Picks up Ken-chu) I don't think she likes us very much...
Ken-chu: Me too...
Sasami: No! My sister's not like that!
Ken-chu: SURE she's not...
Tenchi: I'm sure Miss Ayeka didn't mean it...
Mihoshi: I think she jealous...
Uzuko: (Finishes his food) Why should she be jealous? She's always over
Tenchi.
Ryoko: Although she can't have him 'cause he's MINE!!!!
Tenchi: (Blushes) Well uh...
Ayeka: (While washing dishes. Mumbles) Stupid Uzuko... I don't need him!
I've got... I've got... no one. (Starts crying)
Tenchi: (Enters the kitchen with more dishes. Sees Ayeka crying.) Miss
Ayeka? Is something the matter?
Ayeka: (Drying her tears) No-nothing... nothing.
Tenchi: You're crying.
Ayeka: Don't worry about it... (Tear comes down her cheek)
Uzuko: (Walks in the kitchen) Hey I'm done with my- (sees Ayeka crying) Huh?
Ayeka: Ugh... (Turns her head) Leave me alone...
Uzuko: (Walks to her) Why are you crying, Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: (In a firmer voice) Leave me alone!
Uzuko: But-
Tenchi: Uzuko, you should leave her alone! You already made her cry!
Uzuko: Huh? (Scratches his head) How'd the heck did I make her cry?
Ayeka: JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!! (Runs to her room)
Uzuko: Ayeka!
Tenchi: ............ (Turns to Uzuko) Do something!
Uzuko: What the heck do you want me to do?
Tenchi: J-just do......something!
Uzuko: B-but......... Fine... (Disappears to the front of Ayeka's room.
Knocks on her door.
Ayeka: W-who is it? (Looks up)
Uzuko: Ummm... Uzuko... You wanna talk?
Ayeka: No! Now go away and leave me alone!
Uzuko: 'Sigh' I just wanna help!
Ayeka: You'll help me by leaving me alone!
Uzuko: Well... if that's what you want... (Disappears downstairs at the
dinner table) 'Sigh'
Marasuki: (Coming out of the Kitchen) Hmmm? Uzuko, you look troubled. Is
something the matter? What's wrong?
Uzuko: It's Miss Ayeka... I'm worried about her...
Marasuki: (Thinks: Does this means he likes her? Looks down disappointed.) I
see... what's wrong?
Uzuko: Nothing really. I just saw her upset and she refuses to tell me why.
So...
Marasuki: Oh... Hmmm... (Thinks: I know why Ayeka's mad... What should I do?
I don't want Ayeka to hate Uzuko...... or me... Wait!) Why don't you just
ask Sasami for help?
Uzuko: Huh? What do you mean?
Marasuki: (Whispers something in Uzuko's ear)
Uzuko: Ah-uh... Hey, SASAMI!!!
Marasuki: (Giggles) Not so loudly Uzuko!
Sasami: Yes, Uzuko?
Uzuko: Can you help me- no us, in something?
Marasuki: Huh?
Uzuko: Hey, you're the one who came up with this idea. And...
Marasuki: And?
Uzuko: Uh... I want you to help me? (Whispers in Sasami's ear)
Sasami: And he wants Ayeka to like you!
Marasuki: Huh? (Giggles) Oh, all right!
Uzuko: Uh.... Exactly...
Marasuki: (Looks down) I know she doesn't like me... but I really want her
to.
Uzuko: (Patting her back softly) She will, she will.
Marasuki: (Blushes. Looks at Uzuko) You really thinks so?
Uzuko: (Stops patting her back. Blushes) I know so.
Sasami: She can't ever HATE anyone...
Uzuko: (Says dully) What about Ryoko... (Looks at Ryoko)
Sasami: Oh... well, except Ryoko. (Blushes from embarrassment)
Uzuko: Ryoko's easy to hate...(Devilishly chuckles) I don't blame Ayeka ONE
bit for hating her.
Marasuki: I thought siblings are supposed to get along... not quarrel.
Uzuko: If you have a brain as small as Ryoko... you'd understand...
Sasami: Anyways, what did you want me to help you on, Uzuko?
Uzuko: Huh? Oh, I want you to do- (Whispers in Sasami's ears)
Marasuki: (Giggles. Puts her hand over her mouth.)

(At Ayeka's room)

Ayeka: (Thinks: I have nothing here, so why stay? But what about Sasami...
she's so happy living here now, that I'm afraid she wouldn't want to leave.
'Sigh.' What should I do now?)
Sasami: Ayeka, can I come in? I need to prepare for bed.
Ayeka: Come in, Sasami.
Sasami: (Opens the door. Walks in) you know, Ayeka, (Kneels down near her
nightclothes and walks in a closet to change.) Miss Marasuki is a very
intelligent lady.
Ayeka: Ugh.... Yes, so?
Sasami: She's also very easy to get along with. She's very nice!
Ayeka: (Thinks: Oh is she, eh? Then why did she take Uzuko from me?) I
see...
Sasami: And I was just wondering... (Lies down on her bed) why don't you
ever talk with her?
Ayeka: Sasami, I'm very busy... you know that! Why are you telling me this?
Sasami: (Sits up) I'm just saying that maybe you two can be friends...
Ayeka: (Says quickly and firmly) I do not want to discuss this any longer! I
am tired and I had enough for today. Good night Sasami. (Lies down on her
side facing away from Sasami)
Sasami: But Ayeka! I-
Ayeka: Good night Sasami!
Sasami: Good night... Ayeka. (Lies down.)

(Next Morning)

Sasami: (Cooking but not really paying attention. Thinks: Why is Ayeka so
mad? I didn't do anything wrong. I just want her and Miss Marasuki to be
friends...)
Uzuko: (Appears beside Sasami) Good morning Sasami... Sasami?
Sasami: Huh? Oh... Good morning Uzuko.
Uzuko: Any luck last night?
Sasami: (Shakes her head slowly) Not one. She was so mad last night. By the
way, what did you do that made her so angry?
Uzuko: Even I don't know that.
Sasami: It's like she doesn't want anything to do with Miss Marasuki.
Marasuki: (Walks into the kitchen) Did someone say my name?
Sasami & Uzuko: Good morning.
Marasuki: Yes. And a fine one it is, too.
Sasami: I tried talking to my sister last night. Nothing.
Marasuki: (Looks down) I see.
(Tenchi & Ryoko walk in the door)
Ryoko: Ohhh... but Tenchi...
Tenchi: I said no Ryoko. That's that and- huh? (Looks at all three of them)
Ryoko: What is your problem! I just wanted to cast a little spell. No harm
done!
Tenchi: Is anything wrong?
Ryoko: (Crosses her arms) Of course something's wrong I-
Tenchi: (Walks past Ryoko to Sasami) What is it?
Ryoko: Oh... so he's talking to her, eh. Well... (Walks to Uzuko)
Sasami: It's my sister. Will you talk to her Tenchi? Will you? Please?
Tenchi: I'll go talk to her... (Leaves the Kitchen)
Sasami: Wait! Tenchi! I'll go with you! (Leaves the kitchen)
Ryoko: Hmmm? (Looks at Uzuko) Why are you sagging today? Didn't get your way
with Marasuki last night?
Uzuko: (Blushes) WHA-?!?!?
Marasuki: (Blushes) That is most absurd Ryoko!
Uzuko: SHUT UP!!!!!!! I DON'T SEE TENCHI GIVING INTO YOU EASILY!!!!!! HE'S
SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT!!!! TO STAY AWAY FROM THE LIKES OF
YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryoko: YOU WATCH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LOVER BOY!!!!!!!!!!
Uzuko: OR ELSE WHAT!?!?!?
Ryoko: OR ELSE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Throws a BIG pan at him)
Uzuko: Not a-gain. (Falls down unconscious)
Ryoko: Humph! Some brother! You're no fun! (Disappear)
Marasuki: (Kneels down near Uzuko) Uzuko? Uzuko... Uzuko... (Pats his face
lightly)
Uzuko: 'Groan' Am I in heaven? Because to me you look like an angel...
Marasuki: (Blushes) Uzuko! (Thinks: Does he- is he-.... For real? Or is he
just subconscious?)
Uzuko: 'Gasp' (Is fully awake and aware of what he's done) I- uh- gotta go
now! BYE!!! (Runs out of the house while clutching his stomach. Thinks:
Ohhh... I feel sick. And I'm not even it the lab!! Now I'm really gonna be
sick!!!!)
Marasuki: ( Thinks: Do I really look like an angel to him? If I did, then,
why did he run away from me like that? An angel... Walks into the living
room and sits on the couch) Hmmm... What's this? (Smells the bottle) Ohhh
(Plugs her nose) it's that alcohol Ryoko drinks...
Ayeka: (Walks downstairs) Oh... (Starts to walk back upstairs)
Marasuki: (Turns around) Oh! Miss Ayeka! Come have a seat with me...
Ayeka: It'll be rude not to... (Walks to the couch and sits) Oh, well, how
have you been today?
Marasuki: I've been doing fine... how about you?
Ayeka: Oh... just fine... (Notices the alcohol) Do mind if I had a drink?
Marasuki: Not at all.
Ayeka: (Drinks some of the alcohol) So... tell me about yourself...
(After a while...)
Marasuki: And then Uzuko brought me to Lord Yosho's space tree... and that
was it.
Ayeka: Hmmm... (Slightly frowns) are you very FOND with Uzuko
Marasuki: (Looks down and blushes) Yes... he's been a good friend... Why do
you ask Miss Ayeka?
Ayeka: Frankly, darling, I don't like the way you two have been getting
close. And that feeding thing with him last night... how STUPID! I mean how
PITIFUL is that!? Then again, I'm not surprised... coming from a pitiful
person like YOU!!!!
(Devilishly laughs)
Marasuki: YOU, Miss Ayeka, are more pitiful than I! You're a spoiled brat...
I have tried countless times to be your friend but you made no effort!!!!
Instead you whined and put your angers upon others!!!
Ayeka: Marasuki, love, we were JUST fine without you... JUST fine. And if
you leave, we will go back to our ordinary lives. Face it, dear, you're
simply not needed here. Also, Uzuko doesn't have any affection for you...
he's just being nice because you're new... that's the ONLY reason why.
(Laughs) If you had thought he actually CARED for you... you're completely
wrong! (Laughs evilly)
Marasuki: I have no intentions of him liking me! In fact Miss Ay-ek-a, I
don't really care! By the way, (Grabs the bottle out of Ayeka's hands) I
think you had too much to drink! (Close to tears)
Ayeka: HEY!!! That's mine! Hic!
Marasuki: Too much... (Walks out the living room and runs outdoors)
Ayeka: Ohhh... that peasant! Hic! I'm gonna- (Falls to sleep)
Uzuko: (Sitting on a tree near Yosho's space tree) 'Sighs then groans.' My
life is ruined! NO thanks to that damn Ryoko! (Lays back and leans on a weak
branch) I- AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Lands
on some bushes) My life bites BIG time.
Marasuki: (Breathlessly runs to the space tree. Sits down near it and sobs)
Why did I have to come here? Why can't I just go home!? Now that the engine
has died, I have no way home... That horrid Ayeka, she enjoys making my stay
miserable! But I- I- (Notices) Hmmm? Who- who's there? A-answer me! (Slowly
stands up)
Uzuko: (Lies back down in the bushes) It's Marasuki! (Looks up) What is she
doing here? Why is she- is she crying?
Marasuki: (Walks near the bushes) Who- who's there? H-hello!
Uzuko: (Lies down lower. Thinks: Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! It's only Marasuki.
Why the hell are you afraid? It's only Marasuki. Damn! I hope she don't find
me!)
Marasuki: HEL-LO!!!!!!!!!! W-WHAT DO YOU WANT?!
Uzuko: (Thinks: Great... I...I...can't get up! My legs won't move! Damn!)
Marasuki: Ugh... Oh, I HATE THIS PLACE!!!!!! (Falls to her knees, and starts
crying)
Uzuko: (Whispers) Marasuki...please don't cry... (Thinks: I've got to help
her. Disappears next to her) What's wrong?
Marasuki: 'Gasp.' OH! Uzuko! You frightened me!
Uzuko: I'm sorry... why are you crying?
Marasuki: It's Ayeka... (Sobs a bit)
Uzuko: Ayeka? What did she do?
Marasuki: She said awful things about you and I! She- she thought we were
together... She sounded like she was JEALOUS!!
Uzuko: (Puts his arm around her and both get red) D-don't worry about her...
I'll be here... (He turns COMPLETELY red. Thinks: Wha-what am I doing?!!
What am I saying???!!! She must really think I'm a jerk!)
Marasuki: I can't thank you enough! There's no way I can show my gratitude!
(Hugs Uzuko)
Uzuko: Uhhh... (Thinks: What next?! What now!?) Ummm.... Anything for you
Marasuki?... (Thinks: THERE I GO AGAIN!!!! CAN'T I DO ANYTHING
RIGHT!!!!????? Ugh...) Hahaha... (Let's go of Marasuki)
