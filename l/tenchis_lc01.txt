lab, Ayaka and Ryoko fighting ,over Tenchi of corse, Sasami 
in the kitchin cooking a great feast for the members of the 
house, and Tenchi at the shrine training as usual.

"Tenchi" Yosh said, "consintrate, dont use your eyes, use 
instinct, your eyes are only a wepon aginst you!"
"But grandpa, if I dont use my eyes, I won't be able to 
see!"
"Never mind, go take a bath and go home Tenchi, we will 
finish later, im hungry.

<Musaki house>

"Tenchi is mine!!" Ryoko scraemed as she charged an energy 
ball.
"You wish you demond bitch!!" Ayaka yelled as logs formed 
around her creating an energy field, "DIE BITCH!!!!!!"

The two woriors burst into a colosile battle of speed, 
strength, and skill of the art of shau-lin kung fu.

In 20 minutes the fight ended when Tenchi burst into the 
room and an energy ball from each lady sandwitched him 
sending him flying.

"HOLY SHIT, TENCHI, NOOOOOOOOOOO!" a scared Ryoko screams!
"NO, LORD TENCHI, OH MY GOD, GET UP TENCHI!!!!" Ayaka
