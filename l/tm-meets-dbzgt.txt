	One fine day at Okayama, Japan... Sasami was cooking the crew the food... 
Ryouko and Aeka fighting as usual...
Washuu in her lab making something.. Mihoshi and Kiyone playing video games.. 
Tenchi watching t.v... Nobuyuki 
Yosho watching t.v. as well... 

*Sasami* "Breakfast is ready!"

*Everyone* "Sankyuu, Sasami-chan!"

*Sasami* "Heh.. Gosh you guys.. It's actully my everyday job! ::giggles:: You 
forgot already?"

*Kiyone* "I guess airhead forgot! ::smirk::"

*Mihoshi* "::sweatdrop:: Heey!!! =/ Let's just eat..."

	                          {KAb00m!!!!}

	As everyone starts eating,  they hear an awful corruption outside. 
Everyone ran outside and there they
found.. A little kid with a funny looking hair-do..Goten-san and his best friend 
with a bowl-cut lavender hair, 
Torankusu. 

*Torankusu* "Goten!! You fool! How many times have you crash? ....Let me fly 
next time...."

*Goten* "::sweatdrop:: Well, it's not my fault your mom put an airbag!"

	Those 2 kids continue arguing..........

*Tenchi* "Okay... Who are you 2?"

*Goten* "I'm Son Goten! I'm 7-yrs. old...  And this is-..."

*Torankusu* "::pushes Goten aside::I'm Torankusu Burifu, the great! Son of the 
genius Buruma Burifu Bejita and the Saiya-Jin Prince, Bejita Burifu! I'm 8-yrs. 
old!"

*Goten* "Whoooo! I'll give you an applause for that! ::whistle:: Whoooooo 
oohhhhh!"

*Torankusu* "(). ... Ruuuighttttt..."

*Aeka* "Okay, well, I guess that explains enough!"

*Everyone* "Hai!"

*Sasami* "Hehehe.. I'm also 8!"

*Torankusu* "Really?"

*Sasami* "Yeah! ^.^;; You wanna come eat with us?"

*Goten* "Sure! We're starvin'!"

	Torankusu glares at Sasami... He then has a sudden crush on her. 
=Torankusu thinking:-Aww, those
beautiful eyes, those smooth legs.. Her wonderful beautiful hair, her kawaii 
darling looks....! And gosh!
We're also the same age!!! =D-: ||!i~::record scratch::~i!||

*Goten* "HEY TORANKUSU! QUIT DROOLING MAN! LET'S EAT!"

*Torankusu* "Uhh.. Okay, sure... !"
			
			-------The kitchen/Eating Table-------

	"God, Sasami!(munch) You cook great! You're (munch)equal to my mom.. Gosh, 
I bet when you get to her
 age, (munch)You'll cook even better! ^.^"said Goten, eating as he speaks. 
"Well, ::giggle:: I'm glad you like it...!"
dearly said Sasami. Torankusu then said, "So Washuu... Uhmmm.... You said you 
were working on this time machine,
right? How far will that bring us to?" Washuu suddenly said,"Well, it depends 
how far you wanna go, right?" "Well,
uhmm.. yeah, I guess.."said Torankusu. "Well, there's your answer! ^^"said 
Washuu. "Wow, Washuu!"said Toranksu.
"Yes! You may call me Otaku Washuu, Kinnshou Washuu, or Chibi Washuu... Whatever 
seems great to you."said Washuu.
"Ehehehe... Okay, Otaku Washuu! Oh, and hey Washuu.... I WANT 10 YEARS! XD" 
preferred Torankusu.
"Okie, dokie! No problem! ^.~" snapped Washuu with a quick answer.
"Hey, Torankusu, wanna try it out? And maybe you can bring Goten with you or 
something, huh? 
Sounds cool? =P"offering Washuu to Torankusu. "Uhmm. Sure, okay!"

			-------Washuu's lab-------

	"WELCOME!! This is Washuu Hakubi's lab of Science and Technology!!"greeted 
Washuu. "Yesssssssshhhhhhh!!!"said Goten.
"Okay, Torankusu, you said you wanted Goten and you to go into the time 
machine?" "Well, actully me.. But Goten can come, anyways.."
Said Torankusu... Goten was just here for the heck of it... "Okay, but I brought 
a little guest with me.. You may know the
great awesome chef! Sasami Jurai Masaki!"greeted Washuu. Torankusu's jaw 
dropped... He stared at her legs since she was
wearing a really short skirt. Goten elbowed Torankusu, "Maaaaannnnn! Do you like 
her or something?!"said Goten getting a little
suspicious... "Me? Oh heeeellllll no! *sigh* She's not the right girl for me. 
Nuhhhhh-uh!" lied Torankusu. "Okay, you may make your
move!"said Washuu. Goten and Torankusu walked in nervously. Well, mostly 
Torankusu. "Sasami and I will be going too..."Washuu
and Sasami stepped also in. Sasami stood by Torankusu. Torankusu blushed. He 
felt her petite breast pushing against him.
"Oooooooooooooohh"he said silently... -[ Torankusu thought: 'Aww shit! ::stares 
at her breast:: Ahh! I gottah touch those!' ]-
"Running! T-Minus 10 seconds! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! See you in the 
future!"said Washuu...

			-------Future People......?-------

	"Okay! That's it!"Washuu said. She was wearing a nice red belly shirt and 
a yellow  headband. Her pink hair had purple
streaks. It was longer than ever. Her pants was baggy. She wore glasses that 
fitted her well. Her shoes were black and blue.
Goten had his hair spiked. He wore a turquoise-long sleeved. His shirt had 
yellow edged-trimmings. His pants were khakis.
He had white shoes with gray trimmings on it. Torankusu wore a brown trench coat 
and wore a black long sleeved shirt inside.
He had a violet-blue bandana tied around his neck. He wore striped shorts. He he 
had black socks and brown boots.
Sasami had her hair not pony-tailed anymore. It just hung out. She had a white 
silky belly tanktop on that went with her really short skirt
that was the color of her hair. She wore boots that started from her knees all 
the way down. 
	-[ Torankusu thought: 'God damn she's fine... Awww!!! ::groaned:: 
Maaaannnnn! I really wanna get with her...
I gotta have a plan.. I look really dorky right now.. =/ God damn! Her breast is 
so damn bigggg! Oooooh shit! ::stares at her breast
and starts to drool::I can probably get Goten to hook my up since both Sasami 
and Goten are good friends! Yeah, baybeeeeeh!' ]-
 -[ Goten though: 'God damn! Washuu looks so damn cool! And oh gosh! She looks 
better than ever! Wait.. Why am I like this?
 I never was... Aww well! OMFG! I forgot this was the future! =/ Since Torankusu 
is good friends with Washuu, he can prolly hook
 me up! YESHHHHHH!' ]-
	"So how was it?"said Sasami in a really sexy voice(for all you guys out 
there). Torankusu stutters as he tries to talk to her,
"I-It-It-Wa-Was-Was-Th-T-The-Bes-Best-Ev-Eve-Ever!! Yeshhhhhh!" said Torankusu. 
"Yeah, Goten... Heh.. I know, you feel
kinda strange, huh? Ahhh, you'll get used to it.." said Washuu. Torankusu and 
Sasami were now 18, Goten was 17, and Washuu 
was 22 years-old. 
	"Hey, Washuu.. What would you think the others would say if they saw us?" 
asked Goten. "HmmmZ...I am not soo sure.
Torankusu? Sasami? Any ideas?" asked Washuu, also. "No... =/ " said, both 
Torankusu and Sasami. "Hey! I have an idea! We should
just turn the whole world into 10 years!" said Washuu. "But wouldn't we be older 
then? Like... 10 years older?" asked Goten, being
sorta smart... "Ahaha! Goten!  I could fix that up... ^.^ " said Washuu with a 
sudden answer. "Okie, dokie! Get back in the time 
machine... We have a whole world to go forward!" said Washuu. They all step into 
the time machine and then Washuu pushes the
button. "Okay.. Here we go again! Everyone will stay the same age.. Especially 
Tenchi, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Ryouko, Aeka, etc.!
G'bye you guys! See ya' in the future!" said Washuu quick as she can. 

				-------The Future-------

	"Hmmm.. I don't really seem any different.. =/ " said Goten. "Heh.. You 
dumbass! ::lol:: Didn't you hear Washuu?
She said that she would just make the world the future.. Not the people in this 
house.. Or lab.." Torankusu said, very confident that
he was right, and stuff..
			          -------The Kitchen/Eating Table-------
	
	"Yo', Mihoshi!" said Washuu and Sasami. "Hey!.... Washuu.. You look 
different.. And you too, Sasami! =/ You also 
you two guys.. Uhmm.. Torankusu and Goten..! ^.^ Hey, Torankusu! How old are 
you?" said Kiya'-Kiya' Kiyone. 
"Uhhmm.. 18? Why is that?" asked Torankusu. "Ohhh, nothin'.... You just look 
quite handsome for your age... =D" said Kiyone,
without any embarassment. She was watching t.v... So she thought nobody actully 
cared. =/ Mihoshi blushed
a bit when she looked at Goten. "Erhh-Uhh.. Hey Goten! ^.^ I like your hair!" 
said Kiyone, a little bit nervous to talk to him.
"Heh, thanks! I like you too! I meaan!!! ::blushes:: I like your hair, too.." 
said Goten... Goten and Mihoshi liked each other,
without a doubt...
	"Hey Goten! Do you like War God Police?"asked Mihoshi, with a smile on her 
face. "Yeah! ^.^ I watch it every night!"
said Goten, answering Mihoshi's question. "Great! I can show you my collection 
of the episodes I recorded! I recorded most of the
episodes of it!"said Mihoshi. "Really? Let's watch some!" said Goten. "Okie! 
^.~" said Mihoshi. Mihoshi then went upstairs.
Goten followed along. Mihoshi putted in a tape of one episode of War God Police. 
She then turned on the t.v. She then turned off the
lights. "Heh.. I turned off the lights so we can see the screen better. ^.^" 
said Mihoshi, acting a little bit smarter than she is. "Okie,
dokie! ^.^" said Goten. --------------¯30 minutes later®-------------- "Gosh, 
was that a great episode!" said Mihoshi. "Yeah... Hey!
Let's watch one more!" said Goten. "Okay!" said Mihoshi. She putted in the tape. 
They were both watching... 
	While Mihoshi was busy eating popcorn and watching, Goten then slowly and 
softly placed his hand on hers. 
Mihoshi then looked down at her hand. Mihoshi looked directly into Goten's 
eyes.. "Goten......?"said Mihoshi, softly. "Mihoshi......"
said Goten... "THAT WAS A COOL PART!" they both say in unison. "YESH!" said 
Goten. "Yup!" said Mihoshi. 
--------------episode finished-------------- "That was cool..." said Goten... 
"Yup..! That's the best episode I actully have. Heh...." said
Mihoshi. "Goten... does Torankusu think you are clumsy at  times?" asked 
Mihoshi.. "Yeah.. I feel bad sometimes when they
treat me like a stupid person.. Or they think I am dumb.. =/ "said Goten, 
sadly.. "Same here.. Kiyone says I screw up alot... 
She never told me if it was good or bad.. " said Mihoshi. They both looked 
directly into each other's eyes. -=-And just to let you
know, Goten is slightly smarter than Mihoshi.. There is a weird age difference. 
=/ -=- "Goten........"said Mihoshi softly...
"......Mihoshi...." said Goten, softly also. Mihoshi's eyes let out a small 
tear... "What's wrong, Mihoshi...?" asked Goten, softly.
Mihoshi let out a soft kiss to Goten's cheek. "I'm sorry....." cried Mihoshi, 
softly. "It's okae....." Goten said. Goten gave a 
passionate kiss to Mihoshi. "Goten..!" said Mihoshi, quite surprised. No one 
ever liked or loved Mihoshi, really.. "I'm sorry...
I just never had someone kissed me before.."said Mihoshi. "Sorry... I think I 
should have not done that...." said Goten, a bit worried.
Mihoshi then suddenly gave Goten a kiss.. "Mihoshi?? Wh-WHY??!! I thought you 
never liked me! =/ "said Goten. Mihoshi 
suddenly said, "Hmmm? Why did you think I gave you that kiss, eh Goten? o.o;" "I 
dunno.. =P" said Goten. "Hey, I think Sasami
cooked something! You wanna eat? I'm starvin'!" said Goten. Mihoshi and Goten 
ran downstairs. "Mmmmmmmm!! Miso soup!
My favorite!!" They both said in unison. "Last one to the table is a rotten 
eggy!"yelled Goten. Goten and Torankusu both used 
their Zenzoken "I got here first!"said Goten. "No!! I did!"said Torankusu. "I 
did!!!" said Torankusu "Nuuuhh! I DID!!!"
yelled Goten. "Damn!! XD You guys still do that?! And you're like... 18 or 17! 
Geeze! Grow up.. " said Kiyone. "Ooops..."
Torankusu and Goten said in unison. "Hey, Mihoshi.. Do you mind passing the 
rice?" said Goten munching on his food. 
"Okay." said Mihoshi, also munching on the food. She then passes the rice to 
Goten. "Sankyuu!!"said Goten. Torankusu then sorta
looked at Sasami. -: Gee... I don't know.. Should I ask her out? Will she slap 
me or something? Gosh... And the way she eats!
She looks so damn cute! Gosh.. She would never like me... What about Washuu? 
Naahhh, I don't think so... 
||!i~::record scratch::~i!|| "Damn, Torankusu! You do like her!" said Goten, 
placing a bowl underneath his chin. "Dude, would you
just lay off my business?" said Torankusu, a little angry. "Woohoo! That means 
you really do like her! 'Cause look! I have all your
drool here in this bowl! Hah!" said Goten, getting a little bit suspicious. 
"AHH! FINE!" yelled Torankusu. "Ok... FINE! =P "
said Goten. "::ehem:: Sasami!!!" said Torankusu. "Yeah? You asked?" said Sasami, 
with a really sweet voice. -: Crap, she's never
going to like me.. If I ask her out in public.. Everyone will laugh and then I 
will be humiliated by everyone in the Masaki Shrine!:-
"Uhh.. I'll tell you later.. Let's meet in your room." said Torankusu, munching 
on his food. "Okay. Ooh, damn, I'm finished.. Okay,
I'll just watch some t.v. in my room. I'll wait." said Sasami. "Okay." said 
Torankusu. 

	Torankusu then finished his food, yet, he was really desperate to reveal 
his true feelings for Sasami. 
Torankusu then ran upstairs to Sasami's room. "Sasami?" said Torankusu.
"Yeah, I'm here!" said Sasami, raising her hand behind her really tall sofa. 
"Have a seat right next to me. There's enough room for
the 2 of us, you know. Please close the door, too." said Sasami. Torankusu 
closed the door, then sat by Sasami. "Sasami, do you
mind turning off the t.v.?"said Torankusu, softly. "Okay... The show was kinda 
boring too.. =P" said Sasami. Sasami then turned off
the t.v. "Okay.. Now what was it that you wanted to say?" asked Sasami. "Uhmmm.. 
I was wondering..."said Torankusu, a bit
nervous. "Yeah?" asked Sasami. "....that if you wanted...." "Uh-huh......?" "to 
go out...." "Mmmmm-hmmm...?" "...with me....?"said
Torankusu. Torankusu felt dead right after he said that. Sasami suddenly blanked 
out. Without thinking, Torankusu then gave a
passionate kiss to Sasami. Sasami then followed along. Her silk tank-top then 
fell off by her shoulders. Torankusu then took off his 
trench coat. Sasami then suddenly said, "Yes, I would!" Torankusu looked down 
for a while. He then smiled and looked directly
into Sasami's eyes. ".....I love you, Sasami...." Torankusu then said softly. 
"I... I love you too..." Sasami then gave a passionate
kiss to Torankusu. Sasami suddenly removed her tank-top and her skirt. Torankusu 
then suddenly blanked out. He remained 
speechless for a while, since Sasami was not wearing bra. -: This is it, 
Torankusu.. Your chance to actully do something to her
body!! I knew you could do it!:-, Torankusu thought. Torankusu frenched kiss 
Sasami while he started massaging her breast.
Torankusu then removed his bandana and his black shirt. "Sasami.. are you 
ready?"whispered Torankusu to Sasami. "Yes... I am..."
said Sasami, not really sure.. She then really loved Torankusu, but she wasn't 
really sure if she really DID loved him. Torankusu
then suddenly fingered Sasami's arousel. Sasami suddenly cumed. "Oh, gosh...." 
said Sasami, softly. "Torankusu.... Please...
Be easy..."she said, crying a bit. "Don't worry" he said. Torankusu then removed 
his shorts. The only thing that was remaining
was his boxers. Sasami and Torankusu started kissing each other until they fell 
to the bed. They both went under the covers of the
bed. Torankusu then removed his boxers.  A small tear ran down Sasami's cheek. 
She then felt a little worried about her being
in bed with Torankusu. Sasami then softly moaned. "I love you, Torankusu..."she 
said softly. "I love you too, Sasami.." Torankusu 
said as he was kissing her.
				-------living room-------

	"Geeze! What are they both doing up there?" said Kiyone and Tenchi. 
Mihoshi then suddenly said, "Ahwww.. Those
are one of those romance movies when they make love, and drama, and all those 
other beautiful love stuff!" said Mihoshi.
Ryouko then said, "I bet'cha Sasami and Torankusu are actully doin' IT!" "Oh my 
gosh! Tenchi and me never did that!"said Aeka.
Tenchi then had a huge sweatdrop. "Hah! That's because you are the royal bi-
yotch! And no one will like you, you bald-headed
shrimp!" snapped Ryouko. "I am not bald!" shouted Aeka. Everyone suddenly had a 
sweatdrop. "Hah! Of course you're bald! I saw
you remove your hair once!" yelled Ryouko. Aeka then suddenly dropped. Her hair 
dropped off as well. -:I am sooo himuliated!:-,
thought Aeka. Everyone gasped. "See?! See?! I TOLD YOU SHE'S BALD! AHAHAHAHA! 
YOU GOT MODED, PRINCESS!"
snapped Ryouko. "Geeze, you were right all along, Ryouko! And gosh... I was 
going to marry a bald girl? AHHHHH!!!" said Tenchi.
Ryouko laughed and said, "Yep, you were.." "You know what? Kiyone and I will 
check what they're doing upstairs.. We're both
getting a bit worried." said Tenchi. "I WANNA GO!!" said Ryouko. "Yeah, you can 
take Ryouko.. She's more desperate" said Kiyone.
"Yes, I am desperate alright!" said Ryouko. "I don't feel like going, anyways.. 
I like this show that I am watching, and I don't wanna
miss what is gonna happen next!" said Kiyone. "Thanks, Kiyone! ^.^" said Ryouko. 
Ryouko and Tenchi then went upstairs. They
both heard Torankusu and Sasami actully banging on the wall and moaning. "Geeze! 
They are doing IT!"said Ryouko. "Yeah, I noticed."
said Tenchi. Ryouko then fell into Tenchi's arms. "How come we never did 
it?"asked Ryouko. "'Cause.. I don't know.. ::changes the 
subject:: Aren't we suppose to check on them?"said Tenchi. "Yeah, I forgot." 
said Ryouko. Tenchi then suddenly opened the door.
Torankusu and Sasami then suddenly looked at Tenchi and Ryouko. They both 
blushed in embarrassment. They were both
covering themselves with the bedsheets. They were both blushing deep 
red...."Yep.. I knew it all along!
I told you they were doing it!" said Ryouko laughing at the same time. "What are 
you doing here?"said Torankusu. "What do you
want?" asked Sasami. "Heeeeyy! We were just checking on ya'.. We were a bit 
worried." said Tenchi. "Well, okay.. We're fine. You
can leave now.."said Sasami. "Uhmm.. Yeah, we're fine.." said Torankusu. "Okay, 
Uhh. We'll leave now. Tenchi and I will probably
do the samething! C'mon Tenchi! Let's do it!" desperately sais Ryouko. "Nooooo!! 
Ryouko! We are NOT going to!" yelled Tenchi.

				-------Sasami's room-------

"Okay.. I'm getting sorta tired..."said Sasami. "Yeah, I'm getting a bit 
sleepy.."said Torankusu. ".........I love you, Sasami."said
Torankusu softly. "I love you too, Torankusu." said Sasami, softly. "I'm gonna 
take a shower and go to bed..."said Torankusu.
"Same here" Sasami said. They both gave a passionate kiss to each other.

				-------Living room-------

"AHHHHHHH!!! STUPID WHORE!" yelled Kiyone. "That fool!" said Nobuyuki. "Gosh, 
that stupid whore picked him?!" yelled 
Kiyone, watching t.v. "AHHHH! YEAH THAT STUPID FOOL! .....what 
happened...?"asked Mihoshi, in confusion. 
"AH!!!! NOW SHE'S GONNA DIEEE!!" yelled Kiyone, shaking the t.v. Goten then 
said, "Kiyone, stop! I'm watching, you know!"
"Ooops.. Sorry." said Kiyone, feeling a bit stupid. "EEHHHHHH!!!" said Nobuyuki. 
Tenchi was then looking at Aeka, the bald fool.
"HAH! That bimbo's still there on the floor.. What a SHAME! I thought princesses 
must be 'royal' and neat. Hmm.. I guess I was
wrong!" said Ryouko. 
	"Torankusu.... I was looking for you!" said Sasami, a bit worried. "Oh, 
sorrie."said Torankusu. "I was wondering......
Or.. Maybe just asking.. Do you want to sleep with me tonight?" asked Sasami. 
"Uhmm.. I don't-..." Torankusu then looked
into Sasami's eyes. It made him seem sorta bad. "I mean.. Okay! ^.^ "he said. 
"Okay....."said Sasami. 
	:- Oooooo! That Ryouko! She must pay! She will get humiliated! SHE WILL 
DIE!-: thought Aeka, as she was walking
to her room, mysteriously. 
	"Hey, it's already 12:00 now.. You wanna go to sleep? I'm gettin' kinda 
tired..." said Kiyone. "::yawn::Yeah me too."
said Mihoshi. "Hey, Goten.. Where are you gonna be sleeping?" asked Tenchi. "I 
can sleep in Mihoshi's bedroom." answered Goten.
"Yeah, he can sleep in my room." said Mihoshi. "Hmmm.. Where is Torankusu 
sleeping?" asked Goten. "Hey!" said Sasami.
She then heard Goten asking. "He will be sleeping with me!"she said. "WHOA! 
TORANKUSU AND SASAMI ARE GOING
OUT?!" Goten said in amazement. "GOTEN!!! WOULD YOU SHUT UP FOR A BIT?!" yelled 
Torankusu. "Gosh.. I was just
uhhh.. talking to myself?" said Goten, not knowing he was being stupid. 
"Awwwwwww, that's cute! .....it's too bad, I don't have any-
one to snuggle and hug... =/" said Mihoshi, feelings a bit bad. Goten then 
looked at her. "C'mon, Mihoshi. Let's go to bed now."
"Yeah, let's go to bed. Good night everyone!" Tenchi said. "Good night."everyone 
said to each other. "Hey, Tenchi!" Ryouko said,
trying to say it in a very sexy tone. "Whaaaaaatt?!?!" said Tenchi, being 
annoyed a bit. "You wanna have hot sex with me?"
asked Ryouko. "NOOOOOOO!!! I don't want no hot sex!" yelled Tenchi. "C'mon! I 
know you do!" said Ryouko. "No! I don't!
Good night! Go to bed!" yelled Tenchi, getting even more disappointed. "Fine! 
You won't know what a fine, hot, sexy body
you are missing!" said Ryouko, disappointed. "Yeah, yeah, yeah.. Go to sleep!" 
said Tenchi.

			-------Mihoshi's bedroom.-------

 	"Sorry, Mihoshi. I don't have anywhere else to sleep." said Goten, feeling 
a bit ashamed. " It's okay.. I don't
mind you sleeping here." said Mihoshi, not having to be disappointed at all. 
"Heh, thanks! ^.^" said Goten. Mihoshi was then
suddenly changing into her p.j's. She then removed her shirt. Goten stared at 
her. "......Goten....?!" she then said, covering 
herself. Goten then started whistling away. "Huh?" he said, acting a bit stupid. 
"Oh, nothin'.." said Mihoshi. "I gotta
get changing, too." said Goten. "Okay." said Mihoshi. Goten then removed his 
shirt. Mihoshi then looked back.
-: Gosh, he's cute... :- thought Mihoshi. Mihoshi then took off her pants. 
"Goten, help me. I can't reach this spot." asked
Mihoshi. Goten then suddenly blushed. "Uhh... Okay." he unzipped the back part 
of her pants. He then, could see
her underwear sorta sticking out. "Thanks." said Mihoshi. "Uhhh... No problem.. 
=P" said Goten. "Hey Mihoshi."
asked Goten. "Yeah?" said Mihoshi. "Do you think Tenchi would lemme borrow one 
of his tanktops?" asked Goten.
"Yeah, I'm sure." said Mihoshi. Goten walked to Tenchi's room. Goten knocked on 
his door. "If it's Ryouko...
FUCK OFF!" yelled Tenchi. "Not really.. This is Goten..." he said. "Oh, my bad. 
Come in." said Tenchi. " Okay." Goten said.
He then went into Tenchi's room. "Tenchi.. I was wondering.. Can I borrow one of 
your tanktops?" asked Goten.
"Okay." Tenchi gave Goten 5 tanktops. "Gee! Sankyuu Tenchi!" Goten said, feeling 
very thankful. "Hey, n.p.!" said
Tenchi. "Well, see ya' in the morning! Good night." said Goten. "You too. =)" 
said Tenchi. Goten then went back to
Mihoshi's room. "Okay, I'm back." said Goten. Goten then put on one of Tenchi's 
tanktop. He then only wore
his boxers and his tanktop. "Well, I'll be going to bed now, Mihoshi. Good 
night." said Goten. "Goten......" Mihoshi
said. "Yeah?" he asked. "....well, I know this will be sort of a dumb question.. 
But... can I sleep with you?" asked
Mihoshi, blushing. Goten suddenly blushed as well... "Uhmm.. If you want.. =/ I 
don't mind, really." said Goten.
"...okay.." said Mihoshi. Goten suddenly slipped into the covers of the bed. 
Mihoshi then crawled on top of Goten
and went to the side of him. "I've.. I've never felt this way before.. I never 
had someone to sleep with before..."
said Mihoshi with a tear rolling down her cheek. Goten suddenly kissed Mihoshi 
on the lips. He then put his arms
around her. "Mihoshi..." Goten said softly. "Goten....?" said Mihoshi. 
"......will you go out with me?" she asked, nervously.
"Uhmm... Okay......." Goten said. Goten then pushed his face against Mihoshi. 
Mihoshi then frenched kiss Goten good night.
".............................................." Goten remained speechless for a 
while. "Uhhmmm... Good night Mihoshi..."said Goten.
"I love you Goten.. Good night."she said.


			-------Next Morning-------

	"DING, DING, DING! DING, DING, DING! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!" went Sasami's
alarm clock. "Wake up.. Torankusu! It's morning." Sasami said. "Wha-..? Huh..? 
Fuck, that wasn't a dream, huh?" said
Torankusu. "Uhmm.. No.. It wasn't." she said. "YAY!!" Torankusu jumped happily. 
"Wow... You sure are so energetic for
the morning.." Sasami said. "Hey, I'll go wake up Goten and the others." said 
Torankusu. Torankusu then headed off to
Mihoshi's room. "WHOA! GOTEN!" yelled Torankusu. "Wha...?" said Goten, just 
waking up. "YOU SLEPT WITH MIHOSHI!
UNBELIEVABLE!" said Torankusu, really astonished. "Yeah.. and what's your 
point?" said Goten, rubbing his eyes.
"Oh, nothin', man.. It's just hard to believe... Did you guys did it, or 
somethin'?" asked Torankusu. "No! We did not!"
said Goten, a bit angry. "Ahhhh! XD" said Torankusu. "Yeah, yeah.. Anyways, is 
Sasami cooking something?" asked Goten.
"Yeah, she's making some sushi and sashimi, why?" asked Torankusu. "Nahh, I'm 
just hungry." said Goten. 
"Okay, well I'll get changed now." said Torankusu. "Yeah, me too." said Goten. 
"Since it's gonna take a while, I might
as well, watch t.v. with Kiyone and stuff.. Bai!" said Torankusu. "See ya'." 
said Goten. -:Wow, Goten and Mihoshi!
.....I never thought Goten would end up with her! Haha! Since they are both 
dumbasses in a way. ::laughs:: Well,
Goten is still cool and he is my best friend. And Mihoshi is kinda cute.. But 
compared to Sasami! She is far better
to my eyes. Heh.. :- Torankusu thought to himself. "Mihoshi, wake up." said 
Goten, waking up Mihoshi. "Huh.........?
"Hey, konnichiwa!" greeted Goten to Mihoshi. "Ohh.. Heh, hey!" said Mihoshi, 
rubbing her eyes. "I'm gonna get changed.
Sasami is making sushi and sashimi for breakfast."said Goten. "Really? Cool!" 
said Mihoshi. Goten started changing
into his clothes. Goten then took off the tanktop and then put on his turquise 
and yellow shirt. He then put on his
khakis. "I'm gonna get changed too." Mihoshi then looked into her drawer. "You 
know.. I cannot decide what to wear.."
said Mihoshi. "I'll help you find something." said Goten. Goten spotted one 
shirt that was almost like his. Except hers
was a tanktop and it was silk. He then saw one of her mini-skirts that were 
khaki material. "Goten, these are 
almost like your clothes..!" said Mihoshi, not noticing what Goten's little 
plans were. "Yeah, I know.. Now we can be
twins!" said Goten, sorta immature. Mihoshi then removed her top. Goten stared, 
unaware that he would get slapped.
"Goten! .......Oh, it's ok.. I don't matter to me, really.. 'Cause we love each 
other, right?" said Mihoshi. "Yeah! ^.^"
said Goten. Mihoshi then put on her silk shirt that Goten picked out for her. 
"Goten, can you tie this one?" Mihoshi
asked. Goten then tied the strings that were behind Mihoshi's back and neck. 
"There" he said. "Thanks."
said Mihoshi. Mihoshi then putted on her khaki mini-skirt. She slipped into it. 
The mini-skirt only stopped
where her thighs had started. "SeKsY MiHa'!" yelled Goten. Mihoshi blushed. 
"Heh, you really think so? =P"
Mihoshi said. "Would I lie to you, Mihoshi?" said Goten. "No...." she said. 
Mihoshi then tried to pull down
the mini-skirt a little bit. Mihoshi then blirted out. "Ahh! I don't wanna wear 
no baggy underwear XP"
"Can I look through your underwear drawer?" asked Goten. Mihoshi didn't seem to 
hear him a bit.
Goten just went through it. He then suddenly blushed. He then found a yellow g-
string. "AHH!
...What are these called?" asked Goten, stupidly. "EEK!" Mihoshi was surprised. 
She then suddenly
blushed and snatched it from Goten.. "Uhh.. Aeka said they were good and they 
felt comfortable.. 
So I bought like a ton of them. She said they are better than underwears.... 
Hmmmmmm.........
I think they are called g-strings.. I forgot. You know.. I'm gonna try them on." 
said Mihoshi. She then
suddenly took off her underwear. She then through it to Goten. "AAAHHHHHHHH!! 
This isn't a strip
club, Mihoshi!!" said Goten, holding her underwear by its tip. Mihoshi them 
grabbed it from him, and threw
it in the hamper in her closet. She then put on the g-string. "These are quite 
comfortable! Geeze, Aeka was
right!"said Mihoshi. Mihoshi then went outside downstairs. Goten followed.
			
			
			-------Tenchi's room-------

	Tenchi finally woke up. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Hi, Tenchi! I woke up early this morning. So... I decided to suck you a bit! 
o.~" said Ryouko in a really
sex-tone voice. "YOU FUCKIN' HOMO! DON'T TOUCH THIS AREA! IT'S OFF LIMITS!
YOU UNDERSTAND?" yelled Tenchi. "Your dick tasted good over the night. *sigh* I 
bet you had
wet dreams about me!" said Ryouko, getting a bit horny. "Ryouko.. Leave.. Or 
I'll make you!"
"Fine, make me!" said Ryouko. "What part of  'get the fuck out' don't you 
understand, Ryouko?!"
said Tenchi, getting really pissed off. "Give me hot sex first, Tenchi! Then 
I'll leave." said Ryouko.
-: Why me? Can't she like someone else? Why! WHY?! WASHUU!!! :-

			-------kitchen-------
	
	"Breakfast is ready!" said Sasami. Everyone suddenly came down. "As I 
said.. LAST ONE
TO THE TABLE IS A ROTTEN EGGY!" yelled Goten, again using his Zenzoken. "*sigh* 
When are
you 2 going to grow-up?" said Kiyone, to herself. "I GOT HERE FIRST!" yelled 
Torankusu.
"Nuuuuuuhhhhh!!!! ME!!" yelled Goten. "You guys... Stop... Please... Just eat!" 
said Tenchi, 
desperately. Goten started eating. "Ahhhh! I told you Sasami! You're great!" 
"Yeah, that's why I 
love her!" said Torankusu, pulling her against him. ". Is that why you are 
going out with me?"
said Sasami, a bit glum. "No! I love you 'cause... I just do!" Torankusu said, 
kissing her on her head. 
"Heh... Okay... o.o;;" said Sasami. "Kiyone... You can never stop laying  your 
eyes on that t.v., can
you?" asked Goten. "I don't know.. I am proably addicted, eh? Heheheehehe..." 
said Kiyone, feeling
sorta stupid. "Hmph.. Neither can Nobuyuki, huh?" Goten said to himself. 
Nobuyuki was almost the 
same as Kiyone.. They were both hooked onto the t.v., and most of the shows.  
"Hey, Tenchi! Where's
Aeka?" asked Goten. "Hmmmmmmm... I am not so sure.. She hasn't got outta her 
room since we've seen
her bald head...." said Tenchi, laughing. Everyone started laughing. "Oh, 
ahahaahhahahahaahhhahaha!!!"
laughed Ryouko. "Yesh! All because of me.. I am the best! And I am not bald!" 
said Ryouko. "Yea, we
all know that..." said Tenchi. "Yeah, now gimmie hot sex!" said Ryouko, as sexy 
as she can. "RYOUKO!
YOU BITCH! WHEN WILL YOU EVER SHUT UP?!" yelled Tenchi, acrossed the table. 
"Right after you
give me hot sex, Tenchi!" said Ryouko. "::sigh:: If I give you what you want... 
Will you shut the fuck up
forever?" asked Tenchi, very annoyed. "Yes! I would! Give me one full day of 
pure hot sex!" yelled Ryouko
desperately. "Ohh gosh......." Tenchi said softly to himself.  Washuu was 
sitting right next to Tenchi.
So Washuu then whispered to him, "I will try to do something about it, okay?" 
"Oh, gee.. Thanks.. I hope
you can actully turn her off her something.. She's really pissing me off!" said 
Tenchi, in a really loud whisper.
"OMG! I CAN'T WAIT!" said Ryouko, jumping around after her putting her dish into 
the sink. She then 
went upstairs into her room. "I'll wait for you in my lab." said Washuu. "It's 
okay, I'm done now. Thanks
Sasami! It was great!" said Tenchi. "Okay, n.p" said Sasami, eating a bit. 
Tenchi then ran to catch up with
Washuu. "Okay, Washuu, you are gonna try, right?" asked Tenchi. "Of course! 
Ryouko IS also giving
me a headchae. =P"she said. "Yeah.. =/" said Tenchi. Washuu, then opened the 
door to her lab. 

		

			-------Washuu's Lab-------

	"Tenchi.. Can you find Ryouko somewhere?" asked Washuu, typing into her 
computer.
"Okay, Washuu." said Tenchi. Tenchi then exited her lab and went upstairs to 
Ryouko's room.
"Oh, there you are my Tenchi Pooo! I was waiting for you alll this time!" 
desperately said Ryouko.
"Ryouko... Come with me to Washuu's lab. She wants to show you somethin'." said 
Tenchi.
"Okay... This better not be some trick..." Ryouko said, getting a little 
suspisious about Tenchi
and Washuu's plans. They both entered Washuu's lab. "Okay, Ryouko.. Come here." 
said Washuu.
"What are you doing, you geek?!" said Ryouko. "Ahahaha! Since you've been so 
horny for Tenchi,
he told me you were realy bothering him! You have to stop!" said Washuu, 
injecting a needle with
a type of fluid that will make her faint for 6 weeks. Ryouko suddenly fainted. 
"::sigh:: Thanks Washuu."
said Tenchi with total grattitude. "No problem! .....just helpin' you out.. =P" 
said Washuu. Tenchi
then suddenly gave Washuu a passionate kiss. "I don't know how I can ever 
repay..." said Tenchi,
hugging Washuu. "Hey, it's okay!" said Washuu. "...are you sure?" asked Tenchi. 
"Yes... I am, sure.."
she said. 

			-------Living Room-------

	"Nooooo! Why didn't Rei pick Shinji??!?!" Kiyone said, getting upset of 
the show she
was watching. "Ahhhh! Asuka! That traitor!" said Nobuyuki shaking the t.v. "As 
yet last night...
I am watching.. Stop shaking the t.v.!" complained Goten. "Yeah! Stop shaking 
it! I wanna see what
happens next!" also complained Mihoshi. "Oops, sorry!" said Nobuyuki. "Now, 
who's the immature
one now, Kiyone?" said Goten, with a smirk on his face. "You still!" said 
Kiyone. "You freakin'
green-haired witch!" yelled Goten, into Kiyone's face. "AARRGHH! You good-for-
nothin' side-haired
hair boy!" said Kiyone. "Ahahahahahaha! ::sweatdrop:: Right... =/" said Goten. 
"Can I watch some 
t.v. here?" Yosho complained. "Oops..." Kiyone and Goten said together. Mihoshi 
then sat down with
Goten. "Hey, you wanna go watch some episodes? Or one of the movie series?"she 
asked. "Ok!"
said Goten. 

			-------Mihoshi's room.-------

They both went upstairs and Mihoshi then turned on the lights. "Which series you 
wanna watch?"she asked. "Hmmm... What about the one when the War God defeats 
that Space Police?"
he suggested. "Okay! ^.^" she said. She then inserted the tape. She then turned 
off the lights.
They both sat on the couch together. Mihoshi was so focused on the movie. Goten 
then lightly (yes, again) placed his hand on top of hers. Mihoshi then saw his 
hand on
hers. "Goten...." she said softly. "Yeah......?" asked Goten. Mihoshi then 
turned off the
t.v. It was then pitched black in her room. Mihoshi then turned on her little 
light lamp.
She then removed her tanktop. Goten then stared at Mihoshi, who was only
wearing her bra and her mini-skirt. "Let's play a little game... If you answer 
the
questions with the right answer.. Then I will do something.. Okay?"asked 
Mihoshi.
"Okay..."answered Goten. "Okay.. #1: What is my full name?" she asked.
"Hmmm... Uhh.. You never told me.. Uhmmm.. Oh, wait I think you did.. I know it!
It's uhh.. Mihoshi-sama Kuramitsu..,right?"he asked, hoping that was it. "Yes... 
It is!"
she said. She then removed her shoes.  -: Oh, gosh... I'm not so sure what she
is up to.. But whatever it is.. I hope it's something good!:- Goten thought.
"#2:.. What is Tenchi's parent's names?" asked Mihoshi. "Hmmmm...
He never told me.. Wait.. Kiyone told me! It's uhh... Achika-Chan
Masaki.. and uhh... Nobuyuki Masaki... I believe.." said Goten, not really sure. 
"CoRReKt0!" she said, removing her ribbon from her hair. Her hair
was now hanging around. "#3:.. Who created Ryouko?" "Washuu!" he said,
not having to think. "Wow.. How did you know that without thinking?" she asked.
"Hmmm.. I saw some blue prints in Washuu's lab..." he said. Mihoshi
then removed her skirt. -:O.O;; What is she doing? Does she think this is
a strip club or something?!:-Goten thought. She then threw the mini-skirt
to Goten. "#4!... Who are the people related to Sasami?" "Erhh. Uhh..
Alot of people? ::laughs:: Uhmm.. Let's see.. Aeka, a.k.a. the bald fool
XD.. Yosho.. Tenchi... Nobuyuki.. Yosho.. I believe.. There's alot of people..
I think....?" he asked, very unsure. "I don't really know either.. I just asked
that question because I wanted to know too. Ahh, I'll give you credit for 
that..."
Mihoshi said removing her bra. Goten then stared at her breast... "Uhh..
Mihoshi, you're kidding, right?" he asked very unsure what her plans were.
"Nope, I don't think so..." she said, with a smirk on her face. "*sigh* What're
you up to, Mihoshi?" he asked desperately. "Hmmmm.... What did Torankusu
and Sasami did the other night?" she asked. "Hmmm.. Let's see..." Goten thought.
"Ohhhh, no...! We are not going to do that.. PLZ!" he pleaed. "...." Mihoshi
then put on her clothes... "Well, I actully understand.. but........" Mihoshi 
then
was cut off by Goten's kiss. Mihoshi then followed along. "AHH!! GOTEN!"
Mihoshi yelled a bit. "WHAT?! You don't like me anymore?!" he said.
"Nuuuhhh! It's just... Well,.. Are you going to be heading back to Tokyo?" she 
asked.
"I don't know... I really like staying here.. But I don't know if they would let 
me
stay. And.. my parents. Aww well.. They will understand I am old enough...
I'm not *momma's little boy* anymore.." said Goten, sorta laughing. "::lol::
Yeah, I guess! Hahaha! You can stay here with me. I will always be here for you.
You can probably work with me with the Galaxy Police! I'll ask." she said. "You
would do that... for me?! Wow! Thanks!"he said. "Hey, I am working tomorrow!
You can probably work with me tomorrow. Ask Torankusu!" she said, a bit
excited. "Okie!" he said.
