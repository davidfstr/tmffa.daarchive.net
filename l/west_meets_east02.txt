                                        (Part 2)
                                  By: Universal Escape

Mike woke up and started thinking. It's been 3 months
since he came into the lives of the
Masaki household. He missed his parents, the fights
with his brother, and Barbie, the family
dog. What was really unexpected was he missed arguing
with customers at Blockbuster Video about
late fees. If you worked with Mike you would
understand why he loved arguing with the customers...
Who wouldn't if people argue with you about $4.23 when
they pay thousands of dollars
for a BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, etc.? But most of all he
missed his co-workers.
Carrie, Didi, Justin, Mike, (Two Mikes in one store...
used to be 4 of us), Bennie
Joey, Cruz, Tatiana, and Dalia. They probably thought
he was dead or something. But what did
his parents think?

                                     * * * * * * *
It was morning so Mike decided to get up. It smelled
like Sasami was up before everyone as usual.
When he entered the kitchen he said hi to Sasami and
sat down at the table. He was thankful
for finally learning how to use chopsticks, now he
wasn't always last to leave the table.
Mike started thinking again. When Sasami couldn't take
the silence anymore she asked Mike what
was wrong. "Oh, nothing, Sasami. Just thinking about
home." "You miss home, don't you?" asked
Sasami. "Let's not talk about it anymore. I probably
got you thinking more about Jurai now."
Mike just sighed and waited for the fantastic meal
Sasami was making.

                                     * * * * * * *
By the time Mike was done with his breakfast, everyone
else was just getting up. Mike was
thinking about getting a stereo system in his room
like at home. He asked Washu if she could
him one cause he didn't have any money. She happily
agreed. He missed his Limp Bizkit CDs and
his techno mix CDs. He was on his bed when Ryo-oki
came in and pounced on his lap, snapping
him out of thought, and spooking him at the same time.
He hadn't gotten used to the cabbit
yet and forgot all about her.

                                     * * * * * * *
Washu was doing some tests on Mike's samples. It took
her three months to get to this point and
to get the results she wanted to find, but it was
worth it.  She was sure of it now. All tests
proved to be 100% accurate. But how will she let
everyone know? When? <There is no better time
than the present> she thought. She sighed and left her
lab.

                                     * * * * * * *
Mike was very hungry today. He was already on his
third helping. As usual he complimented Sasami
on another GREAT, FANTASTIC, ULTRA TASTY meal.
Everyone else was up and at the table. Washu
walked in and said hi to everyone. "I have some news
everyone." Everyone looked at Washu like
she was gonna tell everyone she had another invention
that didn't work like she wanted it to
again. "I have done some tests and they all are 100%
accurate.... You see..." "Spit it out
Washu." said Mike. She sighed one last time and said
"Mike... is... my... son..." Mikes eyes
widened, and he looked at Washu like it was a joke.
"HA HA HA. Funny Little Washu." "I am dead
serious about this!" "HE he h...." Mike just droped
his chopsticks and fainted, knocking his
head on the tile floor.

                                     * * * * * * *
Over a couple billion light years away, Kagato was
making a comeback after Tenchi and Friends.
Little did he know that the one person who could get
rid of him for good was now in the picture.
(short huh?)

                                     * * * * * * *
When Mike woke up in Washu's lab, he had the worst
feeling headache he had ever had in his life.
Everyone was around him and looked worried. Its not
every day you fall backwards and knock your
head so hard on the floor you crack your skull. But
thanks to Washu he was perfectly fine.
A little too late Mike finally said "OuUuCH!!!!" (well
better late than never.) "Washu..." Mike
finally got the strength to say something. "P-please
te-ll... me that you are... jo-k-king..."
"Ok... so I joke around a lot, but I am VERY serious
about this!" "Holy shit... this is too much
to take in!!!" Mike ran out of the lab and to his
room, locked the door, and didn't come out
till dinner. He was listening to a Limp Bizkit song
that really fit the day so far... Break
Stuff. He also got into a better mood listening to
some of the techno from MP3.COM (GO THERE
ITS A GOOD PLACE FOR NEWBIES!) on his stereo which was
connected to his computer.
(WINAMP KICKS ASS TOO!)

                                     * * * * * * *
When he sat at the dinner table, he barely spoke a
word. That sure as hell wasnt like him at all
and it worried everyone. Sasami was the first to try
and have a conversation with him. "Mike?"
Mike just looked up from his food with his eyes and it
made him look PISSED(!!!). "What are you
thinking about?" Sasami asked a little uneasy. Mike
didn't say a word and just started eating
again. When he was finished he just got up and put his
dishes in the sink and went upstairs
without a word. This made everyone, especially Washu,
worry all the more.

                                     * * * * * * *
The next day was a little better in that Mike actually
spoke. "Where is Washu?" he asked Ayeka.
"Where she always is, Mike, the lab." She replied in a
sarcastic way and trying to be funny but
Mike just walked towards the lab. Once inside the lab
he called for Washu. "Washu!! Where the
hell are you?" he yelled into the dark void in front
of him. Just then Washu came out of
nowhere. "I was hoping you would come and talk with
me." "I just want to see the results of your
'tests'." he said in a ticked off voice. Washu's
holographic lap-top phased in and Washu
pulled up the results and printed them out. "See, I
wasn't lying. Here is the proof."
"Holy shit... it's true... Well I always wanted to
know about my biological parents...
but I didn't think it would be so easy and sudden!"

                                     * * * * * * *
"So... MOM... how does it feel to have me back in your
life?" "To tell you the truth... I have
never been happier!" "This is something I am gonna
have to get used to... I mean all
those years with my family back home... you understand
right?" "Of course.... SON." Mike was
feeling a lot better now, and he gave his mother a
great big hug. "There is one thing I would
like you to do for me if you dont mind, Mom..........
(?????)

                                     * * * * * * *
That night, Mike was having a really FUCKED up dream,
and was talking... no more like screaming
in his sleep. Being that Ayeka and Sasami were in the
room next to his, Ayeka was worried about
Mike, and went to check on him. What she found was
Mike writhing in pain... (but from what)...
on his bed. She tried to wake him up by shaking him
but that didn't work, so she got in his bed
and tried to hold him still so he wouldn't hurt
himself on a bedpost or something. (I RAN OUT
OF IDEAS DAMNIT!!!)

                                     * * * * * * *
Later that night, Mike woke up and found he was not
alone. It seemed Ayeka had fallen asleep
with her arms around him. <OK.... did I miss something
here> Mike thought to himself. "Ayeka."
Mike whispered. "Ayeka!" he said as he shook her. She
stired and opened her eyes. "Oh my goodness
I must have fallen asleep.. while...." "While what?!"
Mike asked. "Well you were screaming
and I thought you were in trouble so I came to check
on you and you seemed like you were in
pain and you were thrashing about and so I tried to
wake you, but you didn't wake up and so
I just held onto you so you wouldn't hit the bedposts
and hurt yourself." Ayeka said quickly.
(try saying that quickly and under 10 seconds and I
will be very impressed) "Well... since you
are here I do have something to tell you Ayeka." Mike
whispered into her ear.

                                     * * * * * * *
(I am writing this as 2001 rolls around..... HAPPY NEW
YEAR!!!!!) (Anyway................
the whole speech Mike woulda given would have been
tooooooo looooong. so I cut it out. You will
know what happened durring that time ;) )"Oh, Mike!!!
You have no idea how happy this makes me!
You see, I feel the same for you, I just didn't know
how you felt towards me." "Well now you
know. I love you Ayeka." "And I love you, Mike." (See,
I told ya!!)

                                     * * * * * * *
(I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A SEX SCENE B4 SO BARE WITH
ME)Mike and Ayeka kissed for what seemed like
a few millenia, but was only a few seconds. Mike
kissed the tip of Ayekas nose and trailed
down her cheek and back to her wanting lips. Ayeka
gasped as she felt Mike’s hands move up
along her body to play with her breasts through her
kimono. She had always wanted him to make
some moves, but this, she thought, was better than she
imagined.  She could feel Mike's
dick through his pants as it pressed against her
mound. Ayeka let Mike's hands into her
kimono to get to her breasts easier. Ayeka chose that
moment to wiggle on his lap and
giggled at the feeling of Mike's hardness through his
pants. Mike couldn't take it anymore...
he wanted.. needed those perfect tits free! He roughly
took the top of Ayeka's kimono down
to her waist and his hands went to her breasts and
played with them hard enough to excite,
and not intending to hurt. As Mike began to play with
her nipples, he leaned forward and
kissed her on the lips and trailed down to her right
breast. Ayeka arched her back rubbing
herself against him again, and Mike became aware of
his painful discomfort at being trapped
in his pants.  He moved his left hand to the button of
his pants, and kept the right one
caressing and squeezing Ayeka's right breast.  Ayeka
moaned as he removed his hand, but he
had his pants down in no time, and she grinned as she
felt his naked cock brush against her
outer lips through her kimono. (she did after all not
wear any undergarments ;) ) He finally
ripped (not literally) the kimono off of her body and
stared at the beautiful site in
front of him. Mike was so hot he couldn't even think,
and the feel of that
wonderful skin of her mound on his cock was absolute
torture.  But he
wanted Ayeka thoroughly ready for him.  His left hand
continued its
exploration of her breasts, but his right hand slipped
between her legs
and his fingers began to circle her clit.  She moaned,
bucking against his fingers movements
and sent nuclear blasts through his oversensitized
penis.  He
groaned, and began moving his fingers faster and
faster.  Her natural
wetness spread through her labia and vagina as she
became more and more
aroused.  Curious, Mike dipped one finger into her
vagina in
exploration and was gifted with a shout of ecstasy
from his lover.
"Oh.... Please More, PleAse MoRE.." Ayeka moaned out
in extacy.  She was clutching the
pillow, her legs locked apart, afraid they would give
out at the
incredible feelings courseing through her.  Mike
inserted two fingers
this time, and she clenched her teeth with the
pleasure, afraid to
scream lest it be heard all the way in AMERICA!!
"Please, please... oh... OH Mike... please... I...
want you... NOWWWW!"  Ayeka screamed,
finally letting go. Mike probed for her vagina with
the tip of his cock, and finding
her waiting entrance, slipped slowly inside. Ayeka’s
nails chipped paint from the headboard
of the bed, her mouth open in a silent scream as she
felt him tentatively slip inside.
She did not think anything could be better than using
her vibrators and sex toys, but she
had been wrong. It was MUCH better. Mike started to
withdraw, and Ayeka thrust back,
impaling herself.  "Don’t...you...... Dare
STOOOooooop!" Ayeka gasped as Mike's dick went back
in her wanting sex canal. "I...don’t want...to hurt
you."  Mike whispered between clenched
teeth.  He also didn’t want to lose it.  She felt go
good....words could
not describe how if felt to be inside of her.  He
couldn’t think
anymore. His body took over now, pumping himself in
and out of Ayeka at a growing speed.
Ayeka had an idea. She wanted to do something she
thought would be more fun. She got on her knees
and shimmied to lie between Mike's legs. She started
something only Mike dreamed she would do.
She opened her mouth and took the head into her mouth,
massaging it with her tongue.
Ayeka started to bob her mouth up and down on Mike's
ever growing cock, sometimes
deepthroating it. Mike grabbed Ayeka by the hair, not
roughly, and forced Ayeka to go faster.
Ayeka did not protest, as she was loving every second
of it. Mike held Ayekas head still
as to get her to stop with his dick down her throat,
and started ramming his dick down her
throat even further. Ayeka gagged at this new action
and had her chin against his balls.
Ayeka was struggling... Mike finally realized this and
let go. "OH SHIT!!!! IM SO SORRY
AYEKA!!!!" she looked up at him and continued on
bobbing on his dick. After about ten minutes,
Mike finally felt it. He held Ayeka's head again, but
not as close to him like last time, and
shot his seed down her throat. Ayeka couldn't hold it
all in and let some slip down her chin
and cheeks and drip onto her breasts. Ayeka just
licked up all the cum on her face and tits.
Mike entered her pussy again and in no time he came
like a hurricane. This was not from being
horny... this was out of TRUE LOVE!!! (ok i know it
sucked... but keep in mind I never wrote
one of these before!!!!!)

                                      * * * * * * *
A dark figure eclipsed the sun the next day. It was
Kagato's new ship, The Tilympic. It was
bigger than the Soja. MUCH BIGGER!!!

                                      * * * * * * *
Again, that bastard Kagato wanted to fight with Tenchi
and crew again. But he was not expecting
another to be with them. <What is this i sense about
this other boy?> thought Kagato. As
Kagato attacks the Masaki household again, wanting to
really get to Tenchi by kidnapping Ryoko
again... (What is it about her that he likes? She is
hot and all but you would expect him to find
someone already right?) Tenchi was pissed... Well with
Ayeka out of the picture... he finally
got the nerve to tell Ryoko that he loved her.

                                      * * * * * * *
And again.... Tenchi and crew plus one, follow The
Tilympic to Jurai in Mike's ship The Rock
(hey everyone else has a ship!!!! why not Mike as
well... after all with Washu as your mom.....)
to have a battle that will put all the other TENCHI
and crew VS. Kagato battles to shame
because of one loly AMERICAN.........
