Hey again all you happy TMFFA go-ers! Remember me? Thought so. Remember me
pioneer? I'm the guy who doesn't want to be sued, and is about to say that
he doesn't own any of your fine characters!
Also, remember my perpetual disclaimer- I have not read every fic on this
archive, so if my fic seems similiar to yours or somebody elses, it is
purely coincidental and you can notify me if you like.
Another disclaimer- during this fic you might see two words accidently
unspaced. Explanation- my space bar is busted up and when I type fast I
don't look back! I'll try my best to avoid that though.
Despite all this, enjoy part 2 of "Mischeif"!

~~Mihoshi's heart is beating very heavely as she plans to make her move into
the Tenchi- occupied onsen. In fact, with the amount of sweat on her right
now she doesn't even need a freakin bath! But anywhoo~~

Mihoshi: (gulp) here goes... *opens the door and slips in, then slams the
door*

(Tenchi was sitting at the edge of the tub, soaking his feet happily and
eating sour skittles. He didn't even notice Mihoshi until she sat down next
to him)

Mihoshi: Oh.. uh... I didn't know you were here... what a pleasant suprise!

Tenchi: *is startled* Mihoshi! Wha- what in the bloody wayward hell are you
doing here?

Mihoshi: *blank stare* You know what? I have no idea! *grabs a handful of
skittles*

Tenchi: *stares in awe at Mihoshi's half bare breasts almost ripping the
tightly wrapped towel that was around her curvy, slender body and sizely
smooth thighs*

Mihoshi: (thinking) What the hell am I doing? I'm making a fool of myself,
that's what! But why can't I just stop?

Tenchi: er-ugh, maybe I, er b-b-better get going.. *scrambles out the dorr,
trying to hide the erection Mihoshi had given him*

Mihoshi: *tears forming in her eyes* Oh no... what have I done... he hates
me now... *starts silently crying*
*lays down on the onsen floor and stares at the celing*

~~Mihoshi was heartbroken and confused. She wished she hadn't done that, and
hoped that Tenchi didn't think less of her now. As she lay there reflecting,
herhands slowly moved down her body. In a matter of seconds she was
masturbating hard, using her won tears as lubricant. Her cum bubbled as it
slowly secreted out of her pussy and onto her thighs and the floor. Just
then Washu walked in~~

Washu: *jumps* Mihoshi? Oh my goodness, what's wrong dear?

Mihoshi: *takes her hand out of her pussy and sits up* W-what makes you
think something's wrong?

Washu: Well, for one thing you're crying. And another thing, I haven't seen
you jum-off like that since "You've Got Mail" went out of theaters.

Mihoshi: Well, okay. It's about....

Washu: Tenchi, right?

Mihoshi: Geez what was the point of you asking then?

Washu: Screw the bath, come with me to my lab.

~~Mihoshi and Washu are in the lab, fully dressed (oh darn)~~

Washu: So you say you made a fool out of yourself in front of Tenchi?

Mihoshi: Yes, very much so.

Washu: Okay then, here. It's a little invention of mine.
*hands Mihoshi a pill*

Mihosi: What'll it do?

Washu: Okay, I'm really proud of this one: swallow it, and to everything
Tenchi says to you you'll automatically say the right thing.

Mihoshi: Oh goody! *swallows the pill* Mmm, tastes like chicken!

Washu: *blank stare* How the hell could it taste like chicken? nevermind,
just go. Test it out.

Mihoshi: Will do Wash-oo! *walks out of lab and see Nobiyuko*

Nobiyuko: Hey Mihoshi, have you seen my video tapes around anywhere?

What Mihoshi would normally say: Nope. Sorry.
What Mihoshi says: Oh, you mean your porno? Ya don't need them if you want
to jack off. Just think about fucking me up my ass. *flashes Nobiyuko her
buttox*

Nobiyuko: *confused smile* Okay. Thanks! *runs up the stairs while he still
has the boner*

Mihoshi: (thinking) WHAT DID I JUST SAY? WHAT HAS WASHU DONE TO ME!
*sees Tenchi walking through the hall*
(thinking) oh no oh no anybody but Tenchi...

Tenchi: *walks through the hall and runs into Mihoshi, still remembering
what happened earlier* *blushes*
Oh... h-hi Mihoshi. What's new?

What Mihoshi would normally say: Nothing much. Wanna watch TV?
What Mihoshi says:

And once again I end my lemon with a cliffhanger. Sorry if this edition of
"Mischeif" is a little short, but the next one will be longer, juicier, and
will arrive sooner than this one did (sorry it took over two months)
Till next time, <MMike.
