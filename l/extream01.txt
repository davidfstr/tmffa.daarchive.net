		No need for an extream rewrite.

	Note: to Audiance. In order to understand this Fanfic your going to need 
to view the home site for Extream this has storys of each character and how it 
connects to Tenchi Muyo.
	
	I do not own any of the tenchi characters they belong to the people of AIC 
and Pioneer companies.
	The reason why im makeing such a rewrite is because people wouldnt vote on 
the old version and one or more people thought it sucked. )=P

	It will be on part 2

	Oh by the way this is the OVA Tenchi Muyo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~Space 5:11 A.M. Tuesday June 11,2009~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Dear space Journal it's me Michael Bearden after I captured the space 
Pirate known as Katu. I am takeing my break from G.P. Headquarters on a vacation 
that should have happened during my last four our five missions. I headed toward 
the Jurian Solor system. Heading back home. Then I got a distress signal from 
earth it appears that earth was under attack but by who? Zedd was killed in 
1998. But who could be behind this? I better investigate this before it gets too 
bad!" as Michael wrote in his Journal. 

	"What! My mothers planet is being over run by a group of mysterious 
bandets with unlimited powers levels" Michael asked frustrated and angry. 

	"They were last seen in Okayama Japan." The G.P. chief explained. "Your 
mission stats are being sent to you VIA S.mail. (Space mail ^_^;) Michael 
checked his S.mail

(A) Protect these people listed below.
1. First class detective Mihoshi.
2. Sasami Masaki
3.Ayeka Masaki
4. Tenchi Masaki
5. katsuhito
6.Nobuyuki	
7.Washu

(B) Arrest the two criminals who are trying to destroy Earth.
(C.) Return safely and check in.
	
	 "Oh okay I'll get the job done just like you requested." Michael said 
while saluting.

	"One other thing if it's possible give this message to Mihoshi. It's about 
her Grandfather the Grand Marshel.

	"Okay im signing off and heading to my mission." Michael Said

	"Great I can't beleave that I have to postpond my own Vacation time.
Oh well at least im going down to earth everythings alright as long as my 
Extream unit is in good condition I should take care of this in 48 Hrs. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Meanwhile back on earth in Okayama Japan.~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Im scared Tenchi when well the bad guys go away?" Asked Sasami

	"I don't know I just hope that Ayekas distress signal came through." 
Tenchi said 
	
	"I have faith that it did make it to G.P. head quarters." Ayeka said
	
	Than they herd an explosion. "Go hide Ayeka and Sasami! I'll take care of 
these monsters." Tenchi said reaching for sword Tenchi.

	"Okay Lord Tenchi I'll disconnect all dimensions that are attached to the 
house for a brief moment becareful." Washu said

	"Come out come out where ever you are Ayeka and Sasami." said a voice

	"You ain't going to harm Ayeka and Sasami" Tenchi said while running 
towards the two mysterious men.

	"You have no idea what your up against!" Mystery man #1 said while 
shooting a energy ball straight at Tenchi.

	Tenchi dodged the energy ball. 

	"Here try to go up against this energy blast that I call Rapid Needles." 
Mystery man #2 said as he started yelling Rapid fire unleashing multiple 
Needles. 

	A couple of Needles hit Tenchi in the shoulder sending him flying into a 
tree.

	"These two are too strong I can't beat them I failed Ayeka." Tenchi said 
in pain.	

	"Now I think It's time to finish you off!" The two Mystery man said at the 
same time.

	"Not so fast you sons of bitches you are under arrest under article #2356  
Our destroying property and Battery." Michael said while haveing the Excalliber 
MM in stealth mode and in Cloaking mode. 

	"What?! It's Zedd and Pashint but I thought that I destroyed you?!" 
Michael said 
	
	"Well let me tell you that we were resurrected  by the great Kagato to 
kidnap Sasami and Ayeka." Zedd said 

	"Kagato I herd that he died? Oh well now it's time to kick some serious 
ass." Michael said 

	"Yeah right are Powers are now far beyond anything that you well ever know 
Extream were up to Level 60,0000,0000." Zedd and pashint both said at the same 
time. 

	"Oh great This is gonna take more than Extream to take care of these 
two."Michael thought 

	Michael started transforming into Super Extream V.2!

	"I guess I forgot to tell you I reached my next evolution V.2!" Michael 
said 

	"Dont make me laugh were beyond that were V.3 and we know how to merge 
makeing us V.4!" Zedd said

	"Damn I can't beleave that their that powerful how did they get that 
strong?!" Michael said

	"Michael took out his Light sword and started flying towards them."

 	Extream started swinging his sword at Zedd and Pashint but they were 
already gone!

	"Where did they go?!" Michael said while looking for them.

	"Were behind you!" Zedd said strikeing Michael with his fist.

	"Nooo my power is going away this cant be the end of me!!" Michael said  
while falling to the ground and fainting.

	"If you wish to live you will come to Kagatos ship and give up Ayeka and 
Sasami. Extream as for now kagato is calling us."      

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Soja 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"We have some news my lord. Extream has came back to Earth to destroy you 
and I." Pashint said. 

	"How could you let Ayeka and Sasami get away?!" Kagato said

                  "Didn't you summon us sire?" Zedd asked


	"Don't you know how important it is to me to become ruler of the Universe? 
Our have you forgotten what I did to the last person that failed? You know your 
brother Akula he died a horrible death by being sent into space only to
Sufficate and blowup." Kagato said 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Mean while back on Earth Tenchi's point of view.~~~ 

	"Who is this mysterious fighter that lost to those two monsters?" Tenchi 
thought

	"Well looks like the Dimensions have been realigned again." Tenchi thought 
while dragging Michael into the house.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Washus lab.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Everyone is standing in a circle around the steel bed that Michael is 
laying on.

	"The stranger is in good condition he's just been knocked out cold." Washu 
said 

	"Unhh my head is killing me." Michael said while stiring towards the dark 
roof of the lab with people stiring at him from all sides. 

	"Well he's concious thats a good sign." Washu said

	"Where the hell am I how did I  get here where is  Zedd and Pashint?!" 
Michael said while trying to grab for his blaster.
	
	"Don't worry just remain calm Michael they left." The Purple headed woman 
said.

	"How do you know my name Miss?" Michael asked the Purple headed woman.

	"My name is princess Ayeka of the planet Jerai. I looked in your wallet 
and saw your I.D." Ayeka said			
	
	"Why are you searching my wallet?" Michael asked 
                  
	 Then they herd a crash outside. 

	"What the hell was that noise?" Ayeka asked

	"I'll go see whats outside hand me some kind of thin pole our a fighting 
stick of any kind." Michael said while exiting the lab.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Outside the Masaki house.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	There was a weird looking device that had a monitor attached to it.

	"Who the hell are you my clone?" Michael asked with a weird look on his 
face.

	"No genius i'm you only in the future." Michael2 said

	"Boy this is a weird day for me." Michael 1 said

	"Shut up. What you are about to do is the dumbest thing dont take them to 
america they'll find you and kill Tenchi,Nobuyuki,Yosho,Ryoko,Mihoshi,Kyone 
Washu and come close to killing you. I failed but maybe thers a chance to sit 
things right. 1.) Keep a close eye on everybody even if you have to put up 
cameras everywhere. 2.) Here's a lil something about this time container on the 
left I put a key code on the side that opens a door to another unit that far 
surpasses Zedd and pashint in power and speed. Everyone was killed except for 
Ayeka and Sasami. they were captured. Well that's all that I have peace out and 
remember the force is with you. Boy I just had to say that." Michael 2 said 
before the transmission was interupted.

	"Great now wheres that key pad oh here it is. " Michael said as he started 
to push the buttons on the keypad.

	The Capsule started opening to reveal the new armor that was designed to 
destroy Zedd pashint and Kagato forever. 

	"Wow the new armor is gold and has white trim and the sword is pure gold. 
Here's the instructions written by me." Michael said

	Hello Michael i guess that you got the news that you failed. Well now it's 
time to change the past. This suit is at V.5 status and if charged up V.6. So 
when you want to transform just say Hyper Extream transformation. end of letter.

	"Okay so all that I have to say is Hyper Extream Transformation?" Michael 
thought 

	"But first it's time to get rid of this capsule. Oh shoot I forgot to give 
the letter to Mihoshi about her Grandfather." Michael thought while shrinking 
the capsule.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Back at the Masaki house~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Did you find out what that crash was?" Tenchi asked

	"Yes but it is top secret. By the way who do I thank for takeing care of 
these wounds" Michael asked

	"That would be Washu." Tenchi said

	"So Ryoko hows it been hangin? It seems like you found a new home." 
Michael said

	"Fine Michael but please don't try to arrest me." Ryoko said

	"Oh Washu thanks for takeing care of these wounds I'll find someway to pay 
you back." Michael said

	"Mihoshi I have a message to give to you." Michael said handing the letter 
to Mihoshi.

	Mihoshi started reading the letter than later during the letter she 
started crying.

	"What's wrong Mihoshi?" Michael and Tenchi asked at the same time.

	"My Grandfather has died." Mihoshi said as she started to get up and run 
towards her room. 

	"Oh my gosh I hope she'll be alright?" Sasami asked

	"Maybe we should leave her alone for right now." Ayeka said

	"Good Idea let me tell you about my life." Michael said 

	"My homeplanet was the planet Jurai. My mother died when I was 5 weeks 
old. I graduated from the Galaxy Police Academy in 2000 than I teamed up with 
Jason who was born on planet Alpha. We later got promoted to Bounty Hunter. Any 
questions?" Michael explained 

	
	"Who's Jason? And when did they start relying on Bounty Hunters?" Mihoshi
Asked

	"Well Jason is my partner during my mission against Space Pirates and 
Space Criminals. And the reason why they depend on Bounty Hunters is because we 
are the strongest fighters in the galaxy." Michael said

	"Is Jason going to show up?" Ayeka as asked 

	"Well let's see now the last time I herd from him he was on his home 
planet Alpha takeing his vacation. I'll send an Smail to him in a minute." 
Michael said

	"Say Nobuyuki is there any rooms available here? I gotta make sure that 
everyone is safe after all it's my mission that everyone in this house 
survives." Michael asked 

	"I thought we was going to America to hide from those mean men?" Sasami 
asked scared.
  
                  "No it would be too dangerous there scanning the area as it 
is. Just don't leave this house when the final battle takes place I'll have to 
battle." Michael said

                  "Tenchi don't get involved in this battle. Kagato you can have 
but these guys are too powerful for a human to get involved with." Michael said 

                  "Who are those men by the way and how do you know them." 
Everyone asked the G.P. Bounty Hunter."

                  "Zedd is a Bio weapon created by Dr. Andro a mad scientist 
from the planet Beta. Pashint was a Human until Dr. Andro turned him into a 
Super Riper Droid. I thought that I killed them but I guess during my 4 years in 
the G.P. academy 
they were resurected and trained by Kagato." Michael said 

                "Dr. Andro I herd about that guy. He's the guy that destroyed 
100 planets and robbed 45 Jurai Banks." Mihoshi said looking up Professor 
Andro's profile.
	
	"Meanwhile I'll get that S mail to Jason." Michael said 

	"You can use my Holotop computer to send it." Washu said

	"Thanks we need all the help that we can." Michael said smileing at Washu.

	"Oh and by the way could you call me Little Michael." Michael said 
Laughing.

	"Really funny Michael just get that S mail out and hope that Jason get's 
the message!" Washu said frustrated.

	"Jason I need you to come to planet Earth. Zedd and Pashint has returned. 
This is no joke." Michael typed on Washus Holotop Computer. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Planet Alpha~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Aghh what a nice day to just relax on the beach and look at the women 
wearing Bikinis. Man I wonder what Michael's up too now a days. I can't beleave 
that  the Grand Marshal gave me this Vacation and Michael got a stupid check not 
to mention he has to write a report on the Space Pirate Katu." Jason thought

	"Incomeing message Incomeing message." Jasons wrist watch said.

	"Well let's see. Aghh  a message from Michael!" Jason said 

	"Zedd,Pashint alive?! You got to be kidding me! I gotta go!" Jason said 
getting his G.P. Bounty Hunter gear on.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Excaliber MM.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"Computer sit a course for the Soja 2." Michael said

	The Excaliber MM started up its G defusers and started to Hover over the 
ground. 

	"Is everyone sitting down in the dorm area?" Michael asked while talking 
in the microphone.

	"Yes!" Everyone shouted.

	"Okay here we go!" Michael said

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To be Continued.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next time on A Extream rewrite. Kagatos Soja 2 uses it's weapon destablelizers 
to disable the Excaliber MM's Weaponry.
