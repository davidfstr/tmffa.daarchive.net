                          NO NEED FOR A DAUGHTER
                           By: Ryoko Sampath

"Relax princess you're acting as if this is the first time we've done
it," Ryoko whispered.
"Well, excuse me...but I can't help it but be tense, Lord Tenchi and
the others are bound to be back anytime now." Aeka said as Ryoko
continued kissing her neck. "I just.....don't ..want us to...get
caught."
Ryoko chuckled as she continued her way down Aeka's body, with each
spot that Ryoko's lips touched a shock of pleasure ran through Aeka's
body. "Ryoko, I think we....oh god.....we should stop," Aeka said
soflty not really wanting the pirate to stop. Ryoko continued nibbling
Aeka's sensitive nipple, as if hearing the Princesses thoughts.
Finally, with much hesitation Aeka pulled Ryoko away from her breast.
And brought her lips against Ryoko's, the deep passionate kiss ended
with both of them screaming for oxygen.
"Hmmm, you don't seem tense anymore," Ryoko said with a wide grin on
her face, she leaned forward to kiss Aeka again but the Princess
pulled away.
"Not now, maybe later we can finish what we started but Lord Tenchi
and the others will be back soon, you understand right? If we get
caught we'll never hear the end of it. And surely my mother and father
will get wind of my disgusting behavior and banish me from Jurai."
"Oh ok, since you put it that way. I'll make sure we finish this later
....but umm...my quarters or yours?" Ryoko asked.
"Well, I'm not sure if Sasami is going to sleeping with me tonight or
going with Kiyone and Mihoshi on their camping trip. For right now I'm
guessing your room."
"Fine by me just don't be late," Ryoko said as she finished dressing.
Just as the words left her mouth  Tenchi walked in the door followed by
Washu, Ryo-oh-ki and Sasami.
"Hi Ryoko, hi Aeka, "Sasami chirped, "I hope you didn't fight while we
were gone."
"Oh don't worry Sasami," Ryoko said, "your chaotic, destructive sister
didn't break anything this time, I made sure of that."
"Yes, she's right, she made sure I didn't break anything because she's
already broken everything in the house!!" Aeka retorted.
"Ok, princess I really don't have the time or energy to waste babbling
about nonsense with you...just....fine ok...you win," Ryoko said trying
not to burst into a fit of laughter. Everyone looked at Ryoko with their
eyes wide open and their jaws hanging open.
"Well, Ryoko I'm.....stunned to.....hear...or...OK WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA
RYOKO?" Washu shouted as she tried to figure out what was happening.
Ryoko just stared at her for about 5 seconds turned her back to her and
walked away chuckling to herself.

********************************ONE WEEK LATER**************************
"Oh god,..mmmmm...yes...ah... oh yes, don't stop please.." Aeka's moans
of pleasure echoed through the womens bath. The moans and cries of
passion from both women could be heard if anyone had wandered past the
door. Luckily for Aeka and Ryoko no one had wondered past the door...No
one except for Washu.
Hmmm...that's strange, Washu thought as she stopped in front of the door
I thought I heard Aeka, no it couldn't be...WAIT! That sounded like Ryoko.
Washu put her ear up against the door and listened, she could hear heavy
breathing from two people and quiet moans. Frowning she decided to peek
in and see what was going on, little did she know she was going to get
the shock of a lifetime. Washu opened the door slowly careful not to make
it squeak. Inch by inch the door opened, she could see nothing for about
two seconds then Ryoko's wet, glistening, naked upper body came into sight,
the other half was submerged in the bath water. Her head was tipped back
and her face was contorted into an expression that looked like pain but
showed great pleasure. Ryoko's mouth was slightly parted and the barely
audible whimper that escaped through the opening could be heard by Washu.
Washu's first thought was that her daughter was pleasuring herself seeing
that both her hands were near her sex. But then her eyes fell upon the
blurry mass underneath the water. OH MY GOD!! Her mind screamed, please
let it not be what I think it is! Not even the greatest genius in the
entire universe could be prepared for what happened next. As if in slow
motion the mass underneath the water began to rise, and Aeka slowly emerged
from the water.
"That was amazing," Ryoko said as she looked into Aeka's eyes and kissed
her.
They melted into each other's arms unaware that a pair of shocked eyes were
on them.
Washu heart began to beat faster and faster until the pounding in her chest
began to become unbearable. Her eyes filled with tears that stung, and her
whole body began to tremble. "Oh, god no," she said out loud.
Startled Ryoko broke the kiss and looked in Washu's direction, she quickly
pushed Aeka away from her.
"Uh, oh, umm..heh, hi Washu, no I mean mom No I mean.....SHE SEDUCED ME!!"
Ryoko shouted pointing a finger at a confused and humiliated Aeka.
"Now Miss Washu I swear it was you daughter's fault I had nothing to do with
it, she made me do it to her I SWEAR TO GOD!!"
Wahu stood in her place, her mind racing with thoughts. This can't be, how
could I have not noticed? I'm telepathically linked with Ryoko I should have
known a long time ago. I can't deal with this...it's not true! Oh god why is
this happening to me? Where did I go wrong in creating her? I must be
dreaming, I HAVE to be dreaming----
"Uh, Miss Washu?" Aeka disrupted Washu's thoughts, Umm...it's really not
what
you think, I was just...."
"Both of you in my lab NOW!!" Washu screamed cutting Aeka's words short.
Ryoko
and Aeka looked at each other with worried expressions on their face,
reluctantly they followed Washu.
"Hey, hey, get some clothes on first!" Washu bellowed.
"Oops," Ryoko had a sheepish grin on her face as she realized she was still
naked. Aeka turned pink as she too realized her mistake. Slowly they put on
their clothes, mumbling seductive words to one another.
Washu waited outside the door waiting for the two women, slowly anger filled
her insides. It's her fault, that damn princess, I knew she was no good!
Turning my daughter into some kind of FREAK...she'll pay for, I'll make both
of them suffer. THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC GENIUS IN THE UNIVERSE DOES NOT MAKE
MISTAKES IN GENETIC DESIGNS!! I guess I'll have to fix Ryoko...I'll make her
normal  again..yes, that's what I'll do...even if it kills her...but it
wouldn't matter I can just create another Ryoko...she's dispensible.....
