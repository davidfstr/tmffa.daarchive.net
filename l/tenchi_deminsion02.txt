Tenchi Demension Episode 2- No Need for GoodByes
"Stop makeing me love you" Ryoko whispers.
'Wha. .What. She. . .Loves me, but she doesnt want to. She wants to love
Tenchi. So thats why she was so void of me. Man This is confusing! Well if
thats the case than. . . .I only have one choice. . . . . .' I grined as My
hand gently touches her face. "GoodBye"
12 noon. . . . .
"Well See yah Tenchi." I say as I packs up my new sack Washu gave me
"Your sure about this," He said "We will always have room."
I nod "I've over stayed my welcome. I was off gaurd." I said as i closed
my back pack
"Over stayed your welcome. . .Wait man did one of the girls. . . ."
Tenchi said started to get angry.
"No. . .No bro, Theres this evil precense following me around. If i stay
here to long he might catch up with me. And that would be a danger to you
all" I said walking out the door.
"Uh Okay. . .Well bye, and if you ever need a place to stay. Were here"
Tenchi said slightly confused.
"Thanks,  I will. Be carefull. Bye" I said as i started off. I which
direcion i did not know, nor did I care. I just walked.  behind me i could
see Ryoko phase on to the roof of the house and start to yell something but
stopped. I could've used my Telekensis and found out but i didnt.  For what
reason I didnt I do not know. I just walked, And tried to rid the images of
Ryoko out of my head, for i would never need them agian.
7:00 p.m. 3 Days later. . .
The fire burned brightly, as i stared deep into it. The Bird i had caught
and killed roasted above it. I laughed. I could feel Ryokos mouth watering.
'Why has she been following me for these 3 days.' I thought. 'Not an hour
after i left the house did she appear. But i didnt look at her, I just drew
a
mental picture of what see was doing. If I didnt leave scarpes she would've
starved to death. I took one drumstick and ate it.
"Whew this is good!" I exclaimed as if talking to my self. I tossed the
rest of the bird over my shoulder as if i was full. Of course a one
drumstick
would never satisfy a sayian. ryoko scooped up the bird before it touched
the
ground. I layed flat and began watching the fire. I then noticed how cold it

was. "Hummm. . ." I kept a closly eye on ryoko. If she got cold i might
have to do something. I watched her carefully till I fell asleep.
12 noon the next day.
I had hit the road early to day. As usual ryoko was inter weaving
between the trees to my left. I walked for several hours. Then I heard the
scream. I blood cruddling scream, a femal cream. I turned instently. I knew
what was going on. A deep growl echoed throughout the foirest. I ran fast
where Ryoko was. Another scream. I arrived in a clearing of trees by a cave.

Ryoko was down,  there was pack of wolfs approcing her.
"Oh no!"I said noticing the scrath on her  chest where blood ran down
soaking her shirt. A wolf pounched at her, for the kill. I appeared
instently
in front of it and knocked it a side. It fell top the side with with a yelp.

Another one jumped at me, I bent down and plumbled my fist strait thourgh is

hide.
"You injered Ryoko, and that can never be forgiven." I swore at it. The
blasted it off me fist with a a small Kamehameha.
Two leaped at me. I powered up and kicked my foot ripping one apart like
a rage doll. I turned and punched the hotheres heads off, litterally. Blood
covered the ground as the last one scampered away. I raised my palm and
fired
a blast disentagrating it.
I pick up ryoko. No civalazation for miles. I rushed her to a river.
'I need to stop the bleeding, easy enouph.' I removed my shirt and tore
it in to strips. I sighed. Gently I removed her shirt praying for two
things.
She wore a bra, and she didnt wake up. My prays were answered. Well one
anyway. She didnt wake up. I gasped as her breast bounced in the freash air.

I had some pretty strong urges and temtations to resist as I wraped the
bandages around her chest. I got it done quick and put her shirt on.  I took

a moment to look over her buety. She was wonderful.
I washed my hands in the water. Then I took and hand full of water and
genty poared it on her for head. Slowly her eyes opened.
"Uhh, Koran? Wheres the . . ." She said half delerious andd confused.
"It's okay, they're gone now." I said resuring
"It was terrible, they came from no where and then he came and. . .He
treated me. he treated you. Im so scared" She said shivering all over.
"Its okay, Ryoko." I said comforting her in my arms. As I stroked her
hair a thought flashed *He?*
6 p.m.
The trees were a lovlly pink color as we walked. "Gorgous" Ryoko said
watching the falling cherry blossems.
"Something to match the set" I said grinning at Ryoko. He turned her head
as she blushed.
Ryoko started to say something but stopped.
"Go on Ryoko" I said watching her. Of course i could find out what she
was going to say, but I wont.
"Oh its nothing" Ryokos said blushing in deep red.
"No really, what" I pushed.
"Well, Its a song I wrote along time ago. But its stupid." She said
turning away.
" No. ." I said grabbing her bye the chin a turning her to face me
"nothing you do can be stupid."
"Well.  Okay. Here I go" She said. And cleared her voice.
"When the cherry blossom start to bloom
Meet me here in my lonely room
We'll find a passion filled fantasy
And this time you will stay with me

All the misery that we knew before
Stays away when you are at my door
My heart will sing at ev'ry tender touch
And, oh, you'll want me twice as much

*A new dimension of love
A bold adventure waiting for you
The true dimension of love
A soaring flight. A dazzling view

We're gonna take it all the way
We'll make the dream so totally real
See greater wonders by the day
Then tell the stars what glorious rapture we feel

Soon, with the stars of Spring
We'll know are hearts are changing
Leave the hurt behind
I'll be true and kind
Be the best you'll ever find

We don't ever have to cry or fight
Something tells me we can make it right
Enough of wandering far and wide
I just can't forget you though I've tried

This is destiny so why pretend
Close your eyes kiss me once again
I'll always be the only one you need
So go where your deepest longing leads

A new dimension of love
A bold adventure waiting for you
The true dimension of love
A soaring flight. A dazzling view

Soon, in the April breeze
We will bring alive the mem'ries
Yes I'm sure we will
Bring back every thrill
Make them all lovelier still

When the cherry blossom start to bloom
Meet me here in my lonely room
We'll find a passion filled fantasy
And this time you will stay with me

All the misery that we knew before
Stays away when you are at my door
My heart will sing at ev'ry tender touch
And you will want me twice as much

We don't ever have to cry or fight
Something tells me we can make it right
Enough of wandering far and wide
I can't forget you though I've tried

This is destiny so why pretend
Close your eyes kiss me once again
I'll always be the only one you need
So go where your deepest longing leads"
"Ryoko thats. . ." I was speechless.
"Stupid I know" she said dissapointed
"Never! That was buetiful. How did you come up with a peice of work!" I
exclaimed
"You really like it!" Ryoko said eyes full of joy.
"It was beutiful, like you" I said and our gazes conected. I was lost in
her eyes. When leaned closer, I closed my eyes, Closer. . .closer still.
"Am i gonna have to wait for ever." said a familer voice. I spun around.
'No! Not him!' Floating above the ground, Golden hair reaching to his waist,

No eye brows, very musclural, Green eyes. He'd changed but it was still him.

"Lance. ." I uttered in discust.
"AHHHHHHH" Ryoko screamed and ducked behind me "It's HIM, Its HIMMMMM"
She yelled in terror.
"Well Koran long time no see." he said grinning.
"Why are you here" I demanded
"Oh I just wanted to make sure no one else got hurt agian." He said.
"DONT EVER TALK ABOUT HER!!, YOU DEMON YOU KILLED HER" I yelled in furry.
"Yes yes I remeber" he said unamused by my anger.
"You. .I promised to let you go then, but you wont be so lucky this time"
I said.
"Of course I will, You are to softhearted and forgiving" He countered
"Softhearted?! I let you live out of pity. You were battered so bad you
looked like a slug on a bad day!" I said
"You want to see if you can kill me, come get me" He said cockily
extenteding his chin.
"Gladly!" I said and powered to a SSJ2.
"Koran, Your so stupid. You think u can beat me as a SSJ2!? Have seen
what I am!" He said alittle take back.
Then I relized why he had long hair and no eye brows "A. .a SSJ3, Like
mentor. . Goku"
"Exactly, now so me your highest form" he said cocky.
I looked at the ground. This WAS my highest form.
"Dont tell me, all you have is level two! Well I should've know. You to
busy flirting with girls to train." He said cockly. "Well then I give you
one
year." He said " And till then, Ill make sure you dont flirt." In a  blink
of
an eye ryoko was in his arms. "Oh and koran show up, cause you know what ill

do"
He began to dissapear. I tried to catch him but he vanished right in
my hands. And the last thing i heard from Ryoko was "Koran!"
