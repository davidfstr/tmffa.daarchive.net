I am a fan of the Tenchi Muyo series.  I do not own any of the 
characters from the Tenchi Series or Yu-Gi-Oh.  You'll see.  I write 
only for fun.  This is a dark fan fiction.  Please stop reading if you 
don't like gory and/or if you're under 18 years old.

Tenchi's Insanity

Chapter 8: Death of a Genius

At the Masaki household, the home looks emptier.  The reason was that 
the girls were dying one by one.  Oddly the living girls haven't seemed 
to notice.  But there was only two left.  Tenchi was getting nervous.  
He was thinking to himself.
'Why haven't the midget or that slut figured my plan out?' Tenchi 
thought. 'I killed a lot of their friends and they seemed not to care.  
Something's not right.'
Tenchi walked to the living room with Washu and Ryoko.  They haven't 
noticed the missing girls.  But Washu seemed too busy wondering about 
what she'll do with Tenchi.  But she didn't care about the contest.
'I want Tenchi,' Washu thought. 'Contest or not, I'll have Tenchi for 
my own.  I think I'll do it now.'
Washu had an evil smile on her face.  She looked at Ryoko too.  She 
figured that what Washu will do to Tenchi will destroy her turn.  But 
that truly didn't matter.  She wanted Tenchi and now he is hers.
"Tenchi," Washu said. "I think it's my turn to spend the day with you."
"Fine, Little Washu." Tenchi said.
As they were getting ready to leave, Ryoko stopped them.
"I have a question to ask," Ryoko said.
The others looked at her.
"I want to know is where the hell are the others?"
Tenchi looked at Ryoko and felt he was backed into a corner.  He tried 
to answer but came up empty.  Ryoko stared him down.
'He's losing it,' Ryoko thought. 'He has a secret.  And tomorrow I'll 
worm it out of him.  One way or another.'
Tenchi tried to think of something.  But only one thing came to mind.
"They're on vacation." Tenchi lied.
Ryoko smiled and looked like she bought it.  Washu did buy it.  She 
seemed to not care that much.
"Let's go to my lab," Washu said. "I have something special to show 
you."
Tenchi sighed and went with Washu to her lab.  But Ryoko finished the 
dinner and looked at Tenchi with a sly smile.
"Tenchi, I know your secret." Ryoko said.

Inside Washu's lab, Tenchi was getting both bored and nervous.  But 
mostly nervous.  He wanted to kill Washu fast.  But he wanted a little 
fun too.  He figured that Washu was so egotistic and self-centered that 
she'll agree to almost anything.  But Washu seemed too happy to care.
"Washu," Tenchi said turning her. "I know that you just want to 
experiment on me."
"Oh Tenchi hon, why do you think that?" Washu said with a cat like 
smile.
'Mini slut.' Tenchi thought.
"Please, I have no intention to experiment on you," Washu said with her 
cat like smile.
"I believe you," Tenchi started.
'If you're bigger than 5 foot tall,' Tenchi thought.
"But let's make a deal." Tenchi finished.
"Like the American show?" Washu said. "I hate U.S. TV.  All the 
cartoons have little eyes."
Tenchi had to agree.
"But you'll love this," Tenchi said. "But to play.  Mini Washu A and B 
must play too."
The doll version of Washu appeared on Washu's shoulders.
"We'll do anything for the great Washu." Mini Washu A said.
"She's the greatest genius in the universe." Mimi Washu B said.
Tenchi had a big anime sweat drop on his head.
"Did I forget to mention that Mecha Washu must play too."
Washu looked at where her robot version of herself was.  It was a semi 
failed experiment.
"Why her too?" Washu asked.
"It'll be a weird gangbang." Mini Washu A said.
"Excellent is the word." Mini Washu B said.
Washu and Tenchi looked at them with a shocked stare.  Washu looked at 
Tenchi.
"It's not a gangbang?" Washu said. "Is it?"
"NONONO!" Tenchi said waving his hands. "That's something not even 
Ryoko would think of."
Washu sighed relived.
"Thank God," Washu said. "That'll be too stupid,"
She face glowed with girlish delight as she said, "Especial for a 
genius like me."
Tenchi fell anime style.
"Please, Little Washu, can I finish?" Tenchi said getting up.
"Oh very well." Washu moped.
Tenchi regained his thoughts.
"I want to see how good I am at fighting." Tenchi said.
"And?" Washu said.
"And I want to test myself against a worthy opponent."
"You mean me?" Washu said.
Tenchi nodded.  Washu was very delighted.  She knew she was a genius in 
technology but in fighting too?
"I have to limits!" Washu shouted at the top of her lungs.
"Eh hum." Tenchi said.
Washu looked at Tenchi blushing.
"Sorry.  Sorry," Washu said. "Anyway.  I accept the challenge."
Tenchi smiled.
"So," Tenchi said. "Do you have an arena?"
"Do I have an arena?" Washu repeated.
"That's what I said." Tenchi said.
Washu looked at him and snapped her fingers.  The lab changed from a hi 
tech thing to a battle arena.  The same one Tenchi killed Ayeka in.  
But Washu didn't know that.
"So you'll be first?" Washu said.
"That weakest of the four," Tenchi said. "Mini Washu B."
Washu jumped back and appeared on a battle platform.
"Okay," Washu said. "I pick Mini Washu B,"
Mini Washu B appeared and grew bigger.  She became as big as the real 
Washu.
"Plus I add this Magic Card." Washu said.
"Huh?" Tenchi said.
"I'm just acting out my favorite cartoon in the world," Washu said. 
"Yu-Gi-Oh."
Tenchi fell anime style.
"Why that?" Tenchi demanded.
Washu laughed madly.
"Simple," Washu said. "I am a mistress duelist.  I figured if I 
practice.  I can open my interdimensional portal and challenge Yugi 
himself."
Washu continued to laugh madly.
"You're insane." Tenchi said.
"Please," Washu said. "I prefer to be called, 'Sanity Challenged',"
Tenchi had little idea what to do.  He knew Kiyone was insane.  And he 
knew he was insane.  But this was beyond the top.
"Look in your hand," Washu said. "You'll see Monster Cards.  I'll be 
your power.  But you only have a few chances.  Choice wisely."
Tenchi looked at his hand, he had five cards.  Four powerful cards and 
one weak card.  Tenchi looked and figured that Washu had something in 
mind.
"I asked for it," Tenchi said.
Taking a card from his hand, he decided on it.
"Well?" Washu asked.
"I pick this card," Tenchi said. "The Flaming Swordsman.  Whatever that 
is,"
The card glowed.  It encircled Tenchi and transformed him into the 
card.  He looked like the picture on the card.
"Plus I put this card face down." Tenchi said.
Tenchi placed the weak card on a floating panel.  A counter said 1.
"Huh?" Washu said. "No matter.  But my card will beat you,"
She flipped it over.
"This is called Robo-Arms.  It'll boost my Mini Washu B to match your 
power."
The arms of the Mini Washu B morphed.  They became machine guns and her 
power boosted from 1,000 Attack Strength to 1,400 Attack Strength.  But 
Tenchi was still too strong.  Tenchi attacked and sliced the doll in 
two.  She exploded and disappeared.
"One down, three to go." Tenchi said.
But Washu just smiled.  Tenchi returned to normal but since he knew 
nothing about Duel Monsters so he was okay.
"My next card is Mini Washu A," Washu said. "And I use this Magic Card.  
The Soul of Darkness."
Mini Washu A appeared and glowed with dark energy.  She started with 
1,200 Attack Strength to 1,800 Attack Strength.  Tenchi look two new 
Cards.  Both were weak.
"I put this card face down," Tenchi said.
The count turned to 2.
"And I pick this card called, 'Curse of Dragon'?" Tenchi said.
Tenchi turned into a bony dragon and attacked before Washu knew what 
hit her.
"Two down, two go." Tenchi roared.
He returned to normal.
"My third card I pick, Mecha Washu." Washu said.
The Mecha Washu appeared.
"I put this card face down," Tenchi started.
The counter went to 3.
"And I pick this card: Red Eyes Black Dragon." Tenchi said.
He morphed into the Red Eyes and blasted Mecha Washu.  The real Washu 
smiled.  He knew this was going to happen.
"Three down, one to go." Tenchi said.
He returned to normal as Washu smiled.
"You think I'll be next," Washu said. "But I have two cards before me.  
One Magic Card face down.  And the Monster Card: Washu Doll."
A doll version of Washu appeared.  Tenchi was confused.  He destroyed 
Washu's toys and now he have to destroy a doll of Washu?
"Fine," Tenchi said. "I put this card face down and pick this card: The 
Dark Magician."
The count turned to 4 and he morphed into the Dark Magician.
"Dark Magic Attack!" He shouted.
He extended his hand and fired Dark Magic at the doll.  The doll 
incarnated and an odd glow came from it.  Washu laughed madly.
"You idiot.  Of course everyone is an idiot compared to me," Washu 
said. "Plus Yugi even fell for it."
"Fell for what?" Tenchi said.
"The Crush Card," Washu said. "It infects all cards with over 1,500 
Attack Strength.  And all your Monsters are over 1,500."
Tenchi was hit with the virus.  He was in pain from the virus.  All his 
cards were destroyed and his Life Points dropped to 1.
"I guess I have to play this card.  My last card." Tenchi gasped.
"Not to mention you last breathe," Washu said. "And I use myself with 
this card,"
Washu teleported to the field.  She got a big power bonus too.  She's a 
huge cheater for someone her size.
"My card is the strongest card of them all," Washu said. "BEUD: Blue 
Eyes Ultimate Dragon."
Washu morphed into a huge three headed dragon.  She was powerful.  
Extremely powerful.  Tenchi was speechless from shock and pain.  He 
took his last card and looked at it.  He had no idea what to do with 
it.
"This is my last card." Tenchi said.
He placed it on the field and the count to 5.  A powerful blast shook 
the entire planet.
"What's. what's happening?"
The cards flapped and so did Washu.
"NO!  Impossible!" she said.
"Huh?" Tenchi growled.
"Only Yugi did that," Washu said.
The cards aborted Tenchi and formed a giant portal.
"YOU DIDN'T SUMMON HIM!" Washu said.
"I did." Tenchi said.
His body exited the portal.  But it was golden and Egyptian like.
"I summon Exotica." Tenchi roared.
"NO!  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!  I BUILD THAT DESK MYSELF!"
Tenchi powered up with a roar.
"I attack with Oblivion!" He fired.
He blasted with all his might.  Washu shatter into her true form but 
extremely messed up.  She was gored to the max and her Life Points were 
gone.  Tenchi became normal and he stood over Washu's almost dead body.
"Mercy." Washu said.
"You tried to kill me," Tenchi said. "But I'll do the killing here,"
The same symbol appeared on his head as Yugi.
"Now you DIE!"
He blasted Washu into dust.  He took a mini coffin and took in the 
dust.
"That was fun, but I won," Tenchi sang. "But there is only one.  Ryoko 
is last and she'll go with a blast.  But I wonder why?  And how she'll 
die."

Tenchi: On the next episode, I'll kill Ryoko.  But I'll have fun her 
first.  But what?  She has something to say to me?  NO!  Impossible!  
The next episode: Ryoko's Revenge Part 1.

This is chapter 8.  Number 8 of 11.  Ryoko will die twice.  How?  
You'll see.
