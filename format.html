This site is divided into four major divisions:
 <a href="reg.html">Regular</a>, <a href="cross.html">Crossovers</a>,
<a href="lemon.html">Lemon</a>, and
<a href="misc.html">Misc</a>. Regular are stories that are not lemons,
crossovers, or tangents. Crossovers are stories that mix Tenchi Muyo
with other series.  Lemons contain adult material not suited for minors.
Misc contains tangential works such as poems and spam fics (Can also be
considered omake). They are sorted alphabetically by author's last name or
pen/nick name.  So make sure you remember the author's name, or you
may get lost finding the story you wish to read.
<p>
Newer stories are listed chronologically at the main page for each sub-division.
Older entries can be found in the grouped sub-sections that are sorted by
author. Each sub-division is grouped by author's last name.
<p>
Each fan fiction will have the following information (kind of obvious, but
you never know... ^_-) If a author has multiple fics it will be listed after
their name.

An explanation of revision tags listed after the title of each fan fic. This
is generally reserved for the new section.
<blockquote>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>(NEW)</i></b></font> = New fan fiction, placed
  at the top of their respective subsection.  <br/>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>(Updated)</i></b></font> = Stories that were
  revised/updated by the author.<br/>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>(Resorted)</i></b></font> = Stories that were
  displaced and are now in the correct section.<br/>
<font color="#ff0000"><b><i>(Deleted)</i></b></font> = Stories that have
  been deleted as requested by the author.
</blockquote>
<p>
Please note that older fan fiction (older than 4/4/1998) do not have a date
stamp. This was due to the fact that the dating system has yet been
implemented. All newer/revised fan fiction will now have a date tag
to help readers identify the age of the fan fiction in the archive.
<p>
All fan fiction on this page can be viewed in a simple text browser such
as Microsoft NotePad, Write, or WordPad.  Stories are formatted in the
simplest format so they can be read on different computer
systems.  If you have problems reading any fan fiction on this
site please <a href="mailto:gensao@tmffa.com">inform me</a>.  If you
wish to submit your work, visit <a href="add.html">"How to add a FanFic"</a>.

<big>A Special Note</big>
<p>
Occasionally I get request that certain fics get removed from the archive
due to the offensive nature of the material/scenes depicted in the story.
I will not remove any story. The following is a list of reason why.
<ul>
<li>
<p align="Left">
    I do not have the time to read/screen all entries in the archive. There are
    just too many.
  <li>
<p align="Left">
    Only the author can remove their story.
  <li>
<p align="Left">
    I do not believe in censorship. I believe in free speech. The internet
    is a media which you can not easily censor things. The government
    tried, but failed.
  <li>
<p align="Left">
    I won't add any warning (do not read) tags to stories since they would advertise
    the story more.
</p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></ul>
<p align="Left">
If you have a problem with a person's work you can do the following:
<ul>
<li>
<p align="Left">
    MST their work.
  <li>
<p align="Left">
    E-mail the author.
  <li>
<p align="Left">
    Write a harsh review, but be civil.
</p></li></p></li></p></li></ul>
<p align="Left">
If I did listen to all the removal request, a few hundred entries would have
to be removed. Please understand that I will not remove any stories
from the archive just because you find a (particular story/group of
stories) offensive. People have different opinions and impressions on
stories, thus each person will react differently to a story. What one person
hates, another will like.
<p>
<big>Removal of Works</big>
<p>
Please note that I have decided to postpone/restrict the deleting of several
fics for the following reasons.
<ul>
<li>
    If you plan on replacing a old story with a newer part, just E-mail me the
    revised version and it will be updated ASAP.  There is no need to have
    your work deleted.
  <li>
    If you think your work is a piece of **** and should not be in the archive,
    I won't easily delete the work. You should make sure you know what you are
    sending is the final draft. The work is already published, so thousands have
    already have read it.  Also, you are always welcome to send in a revision.
  <li>
    It eats up a lot of my precious time removing works, I rather add more than
    delete.
</li></li></li></ul>
