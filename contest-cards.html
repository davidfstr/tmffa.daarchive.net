<big><big>No Need for Rules!</big></big>
<p>
The rules are fairly simple. The contestants must answer all of the questions
on the quiz. There will be a total of ten questions. The contestant that
answers all ten questions correctly wins two packages of Tenchi trading cards.
There will only be one winner. Also, if no one answers all ten questions
correctly, then the contestant with the most correct answers will win the
three packages of Tenchi trading cards. All questions must be answered to
qualify. If one question is not answered, you will be disqualified. No explicit
language or pictures are accepted. If one of the questions has an answer
that is inappropriate, then he or she will be disqualified from the contest.
Send entries to <a href="mailto:washu@saiyan.com">washu@saiyan.com</a>. If
you have any questions, email me at the address above. These are the rules
for the contest. Enjoy playing.
<p>
<big><big>No Need for a Format</big></big>
<p>
This is what the contestant's sheet should look like. You will not be
disqualified for not following the format. This is just to make it easier
for me to read. It is easier to follow then the rules. The contestants need
to number downward from one to ten. Your answer will be in front of the numbers.
For Example:
<ol>
<li>
    Washu
  <li>
    Tenchi
  <li>
    Ayeka
</li></li></li></ol>
<p>
That is an example of how the format should look. Remember you do not have
to answer in complete sentences.
<p>
<big><big>Expiration Date for Contest</big></big>
<p>
Since the contest is fairly easy, the contest will end January 30, 2000.
The winner will be announced on February 2, 2000. So if you are interested,
accept my challenge and play my contest. The ten questions are below. This
will see who is a true Tenchi fan. Good luck!
