Leveling the Playing Field
Part IV of the "Chronicle" Series
By Greg "Puff-Cloud" Kerby

Chapter 1

	"We have to get into my lab as soon as possible. I can
block the power drain if we act quickly!" Cried Washu.  Ayeka
was losing her Jurai power at the hands of Kagato. Washu turned
to Ryoko.  She knew exactly what Washu would ask of her.
Without hesitation, she carefully picked Ayeka into her arms
and followed Washu to the staircase that led to her subspace
lab.  But she refused to believe that Kagato was alive.  She
had seen Tenchi destroy the fiend with the Lighthawk Sword. `Impossible! 
Kagato had disintegrated right before her eyes,'
thought the space demon.  It was becoming a paradox between
two outcomes, which spawned only two questions.  How could
Kagato possibly be alive? And if he is, what is he going to
do next?

	Washu stopped for a moment to turn around.  "Tenchi..
Sasami...and you..." 
she spoke, pointing her finger
straight at Sabi. The pupils of his eyes contracted slightly.
"Huh? Who...me?" He said.  "Washu, don't let Ayeka die!"
Cried Sasami. She had tears in her eyes. She recalled the
events she had with Ayeka. She cared so much for her sister.
When she thought she was just Tsunami's creation, it was her
sister who said that didn't matter and that she would always
be her sister, creation or not.  She wanted those moments to
last forever.

	Washu knelt down in front of Sasami and put her hand on
Sasami's shoulder. "That's why I need you, my dearest
Sasami." She spoke softly.  The young princess slowly lifted
her head. She still had tears in her eyes, but her facial
expressions calmed everyone down.  Suddenly, she was almost
startled by a hand resting on her shoulder.  It was Tenchi's
hand. "Don't worry Sasami.  We'll save Ayeka." Spoke Tenchi
softly. "Yes. We'll do all we can to save your sister." Said
Sabi, walking toward the others.  Sasami wiped her eyes dry
of her tears.  Tenchi extended a hand to her, which she gladly
took in her hand.  A smile appeared on Washu's face. "Then
shall we?" Washu said as she walked towards the lab door.
The others followed her, except Mihoshi. Her watch was going
off. She looked down at her watch. "An emergency! Oh dear.
I'd better get to my shuttle quickly!" She cried, turning
the watch off. With that, she reached her hand into her
hair and pulled out a white puffball. She squeezed it,
transforming it into her control cube. Mihoshi turned the
right side of the cube clockwise, instantly teleporting
her to her shuttle.

Location: Battle Ship Kunai
Planetary System: Galaxy M31-"Milky-Way" Solar System

	Kagato wandered about on the ship, observing the
different components of the Kunai.  His brother's ship was
an excellent piece of work.  But that was beside the point.
The point was to figure out the best way to destroy the one
that had nearly destroyed him in the past.  He knew this
time; it wouldn't be easy to get past him.  Sumakka had no
idea how powerful this boy could be.  And he could have other
possible allies accompanying him, not including his current
ones (Ryoko, Ayeka and Sasami, Mihoshi, Washu). Konachi's
family succession survived into the current 3rd generation.
But in the midst of it, he needed to keep himself prepared.
Still, if he could, he wanted that Master Key badly.  Then
he could finally be able to possess and control the power
of Tsunami.  He would stop at nothing to have his hands on
it, now that he would Princess Ayeka's royal blood in his
veins.

***********************************************************

	The only sounds in the laboratory were the many
machines at work, and the sound of Washu typing on a keyboard.
Ayeka lay in a small capsule, as big as a hyperbolic chamber
fit for one to lie down in.  Tenchi, Sasami, and Sabi were
sitting in chairs with an IV in each individual wrist.  Washu
was busy typing on a keyboard when she heard a sound on the
screen in front of her.  She looked carefully, making sure
she had read the data correctly.  She suddenly stopped with
a terrifying look on her face, which slowly turned into a
smile.  "She will recover within minutes, Sasami.  Your
sister will live."  Tears were on the brink of falling down
her cheeks.  It was a dream she thought would never come true.
She had to admit; after all... only one person other than
Tsunami could perform such an incredible feat.  And that
person could only be Washu.

	"I'm not through just yet, you guys."  The three in
the chairs were not sure what she meant by that.  With that,
Washu descended from her floating cushion.  She proceeded
to a small box.  She pushed some buttons of a keyboard.
After coming open, she took out a small device shaped like
an oval.  "What is that, Washu?" asked an intrigued Sasami.
"It will keep Kagato from absorbing Ayeka's Jurai life
force."  remarked the 
scientist, who snapped her fingers.  The tentacle
arms used to ensnare Tenchi during her bizarre experiments,
instead, took the IVs out of the Tenchi, Sabi, and Sasami,
followed by some gauze to soak up the blood that began to
slowly emerge from their arms.  The sound of the chamber
depressurizing filled the room, which was followed by a short
silence.  The door opened slowly until Ayeka was in view.
Washureached out and put the device on the princess' upper
arm.  "She should wake with an hour.  No need to thank the
Great Washu, the universe's number one genius scientist!!!"
cried the seemingly
happy Washu.

	Tenchi and Sasami cheered with joy.  "Thank you,
Little Washu." cried Tenchi.  Sabi could only look on with
solitude.  Not only that, he had a sense of accomplishment
in his smile.
