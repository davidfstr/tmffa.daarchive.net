Ryoko in Love
Prologe: New Troubles
By Ryoko-Himesama and Little Washu

Ryoko and Ayeka reappeared in the Misaki living room with an injured Tenchi
between them.  Ryoko turned to Ayeka.
"Hurry, we'd better get him to a bed so Washu can look at him.
Ayeka nodded and the two struggled to get Tenchi upstairs with Washu behind
them.  Finally they arrived and Washu ran a few tests.
"He'll be just fine." she declared "He just needs some rest."
Suddenly, her eyes grew wide and her computer appeared in front of her.  As
she was typing rapidly, Ryoko began to fade out.  Acting quickly, more out
of
habit then thought, Ayeka grabbed the backpack containing the shield and
used
it on Ryoko.
"What happened?" Ryoko asked after a few minutes.
"Someone is interfereing with the past again." said Washu. "Yours."
"You're kidding right?" asked Ryoko.  "This has to be one of your tricks."
"I'm afraid not." said Washu.
"Who would want to interfere with My past?" Ryoko exclaimed.
Washu ignored her and began to type quickly.
"Whoever or whatever is interfereing, it is back when you were controlled by

Kagato." said Washu.
Ryoko shuddered, that name brought up bad memories for her.
"What should we do?" asked Ayeka.
"You'd better round everyone up and take another trip to the past." said
Washu.
"What about Tenchi!" demanded Ryoko, "He's in no condition to come with us."

"Sadly, daughter, you're right.  He'll have to stay here until he heals."
said Washu. "I'll have to try to speed up the process."
Ryoko dropped out the shield-net and helped Ayeka pick up Tenchi once more.

They trudged downstairs to tell the others that there was another battle to
fight and this time, they wouldn't have Tenchi to help them.
