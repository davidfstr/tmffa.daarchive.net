                           INTERLUDE
Opening Shot: Darkness.

                         WASHUU (O.S.)
            Okay, that brings us up to the last
            reality.

Fade into WASHUU standing beneath the spotlight in the darkness.  She
has her head down as if staring into her shadow.

                            WASHUU
            <shakes head> Perhaps the worse one
            of them all. <beat>  I don't know why,
            but I felt good after the last one. I
            thought I had a pretty good handle on
            things.

As she talks, the scene fades to show WASHUU fiddling with the
control matrix with ADAM pacing around behind her.

                            WASHUU
            I had figured out most of the problems
            and my data indicated that there was
            only one reality left: Prime. The first
            reality entered into the matrix, <beat>
            of course I know whose it was.

WASHUU looks up from the control matrix at the shadowy computer
in front of her then back down at the control matrix.  ADAM
stops pacing and looks over to WASHUU.

                             ADAM
            I wish there was something more I could
            do. I feel so useless.

                            WASHUU
            <absent-mindedly> Uh-huh...

                             ADAM
            I mean, I jump into the realities and
            get shot at, swung at, and generally
            get to swashbuckle around, and that's
            all important and stuff...

                            WASHUU
            Uh-huh...

                             ADAM
            But now all I do is sit around and
            wait for you to finish fixing that
            thing.

                            WASHUU
            Uh-huh...

                             ADAM
            I mean, as much time as I have been
            as your assistant, I still know next
            to nothing about all this ... uhh,
            stuff.  I didn't even finish High
            School, let alone pick up a galactic
            intelligence such as you have.

                            WASHUU
            Uh-huh...

                             ADAM
            Uhh, Washuu?

                            WASHUU
            Uh-huh...

                             ADAM
            Are you even listening to me?

                            WASHUU
            Uh-huh...

ADAM clutches his teeth and balls his hands.

                             ADAM
            Arrgg! Say something other than 'uh-huh!'

WASHUU stands up suddenly.

                            WASHUU
            <shouts> YES!

                             ADAM
            <startled> You don't have to get so
            excited...

                            WASHUU
            I fixed it!

                             ADAM
            Huh? -- Oh! Well, that good.

                            WASHUU
            That's right, just gotta activated it
            and tear this whole charade down.

                             ADAM
            Well then, lets do it.  Time to get
            back our true reality.

WASHUU sets the control matrix down and steps back a bit.  Creating
her shadowy keyboard she taps a few times and the globe lights up. As
she continues to type, the matrix begins to float and spin.

                            WASHUU
            Circuts ... check!  Bio's ... check!
            Mechanisms ... check!  Intergration ...
            check!  Systems online.

                             ADAM
            All right, back to the normal world.

                            WASHUU
            Activating ...

Cut to black.

               Episode 7: Time And Space Adventures

                             ACT III

Establishing shot: Darkness.  Letters slowly form on the screen in
white:
                           R Y O U K O

Fade to show a city street before a majestic looking building.  A few
cars are scattered along the sides of the road, all old Ford Model-T's.
The scene is relatively quiet, and from the small soft sounds of birds
chirping it seems like it's early morning.

The screen suddenly shakes and the sound of a large explosion is heard
at the same time as all the windows in the building flash white before
exploding outwards.  The sound of a siren is heard coming from the
building before RYOUKO runs out wearing brown pants, a white shrit,
and a brown vest, carrying a bag slung over her shoulder.  She looks
around frantically then runs over to one of the cars and speeds off.

A few seconds later a group of police cars arrive.  Several stop in
front of the bank while two chase after RYOUKO.  Cut to the inside of
RYOUKO's car.  She looks between the rear view mirror and the road.
She wipes her brow once from sweat.

                            RYOUKO
            Damn, how'd the coppers get here
            so damned fast? <beat> I'll have
            to loose them in the city.

She swerves the wheel to the right and sharply turns a corner going
into a side alley.  One of the police cars follows suit, the other
smashes into one side of the alley before tipping over and crashing,
blocking off the way she came.  Cut to RYOUKO.

                            RYOUKO
            Ha ha!  One down, one to go.

Cut to first person of RYOUKO as she swerves around garbage cans and
through busy streets.  Cut to the outside as she comes out of the
alley onto a main road and turns onto it.  A second later the police
car comes through and smashes into a few garbage cans but continues
to follow.  Cut to RYOUKO.

                            RYOUKO
            Hmm... he's good.

Cut to an exterior shot beside RYOUKO as the cop car begins to catch
up and pull along side RYOUKO.  As the car pulls up you can see that
it's being driven by KIYONNE.

                            KIYONNE
            <yelled> Ryouko!  Pull over at once!

                            RYOUKO
            No way!  I don't brake for anyone,
            not even the commissioner of police!

                            KIYONNE
            You'll brake or I'll take you down!

                            RYOUKO
            Try me!

RYOUKO's car speeds ahead and KIYONNE steps on her gas to catch up.
Cut to RYOUKO as she looks in her rear view mirror, watching KIYONNE
gain on her.

                            RYOUKO
            Damn, her car's much faster than mine.
            She's going to get me unless I can
            lose her.

RYOUKO's attention is caught by an up coming department store with a
very large side window displaying all sorts of fancy woman's dresses.

                            RYOUKO
            Hmm...

Cut to KIYONNE.  She's talking on a very large radio.

                            KIYONNE
            We're heading down 4th street.  I need
            someone to get in front of her and
            block her off!

                        DISPATCHER (V.O.)
            <static> Ooh... Kiyoonnne... all the
            cars are at the bank.  What am I
            supposed to do?

                            KIYONNE
            Damn it Mihoshi!  Can't you do anythi—
            oh my god!

Cut to exterior of KIYONNE's car as she watches RYOUKO swerve off
the road and plow into a department store through it's side window.
She gapes in surprise for a second then bares down on her car and
takes it in.  Cut to RYOUKO.  She's being tossed around inside of
the car while she tries to wave people out of the way.

                            RYOUKO
            <yelled> Come on people, MOVE!!

Cut to the opposite side of the department store.  The window
explodes outwards and RYOUKO drives through with her car and turns
to drive down the road.  A few seconds later KIYONNE drives through
but slides on the debris and smashes into a car across the street.

Cut to RYOUKO.

                            RYOUKO
            Heh heh.

Cut to KIYONNE as she climbs out of her car.  She looks down the road
and exhales as she see's RYOUKO's car driving away.  She slams her
fist into the top of the car.

                            KIYONNE
            Damn!

Cut to show RYOUKO driving down a long road away from the camera.
Fade to show a wooden end table with a lamp and a pocket watch on it.
A hand reaches over for the watch and picks it up.  As the camera
follows the hand, we see TENCHI in a nice suit, stuffing the watch
into his pocket.  In the background we can hear AEKA yelling.  TENCHI
looks towards the voice and the camera pans back from TENCHI, through
a doorway to show AEKA yelling at KIYONNE and MIHOSHI dressed in
black police duds.

                             AEKA
            I can't believe this!  You let her get
            away when you even knew she was going
            to rob that bank, THIS MORNING!

                            KIYONNE
            There were complications, Ms. Aeka.

                             AEKA
            Complications?! What, you had to
            actually THINK for a change?

                            KIYONNE
            Now, Ms. Aeka...

                             AEKA
            Now you listen to me, first!

Cut to show a long hearth with a bunch of pictures propped up on it.
Pan across the pictures as AEKA yells.  The first few are of either
TENCHI dressed up in some occasion and posing for a picture, or AEKA
doing the same.

                             AEKA
            That ... criminal has stolen over
            two million dollars from my family
            assets and doesn't seem to have any
            intention of stopping.

Further pictures show AEKA with bunches of finely dressed people and
TENCHI off to the side looking slightly unhappy.  A few pictures show
AEKA standing amidst wealth while TENCHI seems secluded in the corner.

                            KIYONNE
            All of our resources have been put
            into catching Ryouko and any associates
            she may have but it's going to take
            time, Ms. Aeka.

                             AEKA
            Time?! You're saying I should just sit
            here and wait for my fortune to be
            stolen from me?

Another picture that stands out from the rest is one of AEKA in farm
clothes standing with two rather old and unsightly people before a
large farm.  A picture right next to it is a picture of TENCHI in a
simple suit, in a portrait picture with his parents looking rather
happy.

                             AEKA
            You cops may have never seen money
            with your meager pay, but I have, and
            even if you don't know what it means
            to lose millions, I DO.  I will not
            let you leave here without some
            assurance that you'll catch this criminal
            and make her pay back everything she's
            taken.

                            KIYONNE
            I don't think you have to be rude, Ms—

                             AEKA
            That's exactly your problem, you DON'T
            think!

One of the final pictures is a large portrait with AEKA and TENCHI.
AEKA seems rather content while TENCHI is frowning.  Beside that
picture is a small picture taken at some party that has TENCHI smiling
largely while shaking someone's hand that seems to be obscured by the
frame.  Pause on this picture for a few seconds.

                            KIYONNE
            On behalf of the police department I must
            protest this treatment.  We are trying
            best to find this criminal, and even if
            you do not provide regular contributions
            to the police department, other people
            do and it is those people we need to see
            right now.

                             AEKA
            Fine. Get out of my sight!  And don't come
            back here unless you have news of Ryouko's
            capture!

Cut to show AEKA forcing KIYONNE and MIHOSHI out of the house and
firmly shutting the door.  She looks out the small window on the
door and watches the two officers leave.

                          TENCHI(O.S.)
            Aeka...

AEKA jerks her head over, startled.

                             AEKA
            Oh, Tenchi. You startled me.

Pan back to show TENCHI walking over to AEKA.

                            TENCHI
            You shouldn't be so harsh with the
            police like that.  They're just doing
            their job.

                             AEKA
            <growls> They're not doing it well
            enough.

                            TENCHI
            I guess...

                             AEKA
            What's the matter, Tenchi?

                            TENCHI
            Its... nothing.

                             AEKA
            Tell me so I can help.

                            TENCHI
            In ... I mean.  Since we've been
            married ... what I mean is— why
            did you marry me?

AEKA is taken aback.

                             AEKA
            Wha -– because I love you. Why are
            you asking me?

                            TENCHI
            It's just... sometimes it seems like
            you--

He's cut off by the sound of something breaking.  They both turn
towards the source of the noise.

                            TENCHI
            What was that?

                             AEKA
            It's probably Sherry breaking another
            dish. <growls> I'll take care of her.

TENCHI grabs her arm as she moves away.

                            TENCHI
            No... why don't you let me handle it.
            I'm it's nothing big.  I'll get a
            drink for you while I'm in there.

                             AEKA
            Oh, alright.

TENCHI walks off as AEKA moves over to the hearth and looks at the
pictures.  As she moves down the line she notices one of the pictures
missing and looks around the ground for it.

Cut to the kitchen.  TENCHI walks in and looks around.

                            TENCHI
            Sherry? <beat> Hello?

As he steps forward he hears a faint cracking noise.  He looks down to
see the broken plate on the floor.

                            TENCHI
            Oh, must have been the wind.

He bends down to pick up the pieces as the camera moves with him we
see beneath the counter, RYOUKO crouched up next to the cabinet.
TENCHI begins to put pieces of the plate in his hand then he suddenly
pauses and looks over to RYOUKO.  He jumps back, startled.

                            TENCHI
            Ah!

The pieces drop to the floor and RYOUKO quickly moves out to put her
hand over TENCHI's mouth.

                            RYOUKO
            Hush!

                          AEKA(O.S.)
            Tenchi? Tenchi, what was that?

RYOUKO motions her head towards the door and removes her hand from
TENCHI's mouth.

                            TENCHI
            Uh ... nothing Aeka. I just cut my
            hand on a piece of broken plate.

                          AEKA(O.S.)
            It isn't any of the fine china is it?

                            TENCHI
            Uh.. no it's just some Faberware.

                          AEKA(O.S.)
            Okay.

RYOUKO listens for a few seconds then gets up off of TENCHI and helps
him to his feet.

                            TENCHI
            What are yo—

                            RYOUKO
            Shhh!

                            TENCHI
            <whispers> What are you doing here?

                            RYOUKO
            I came to see you.

                            TENCHI
            Is it normal for you to visit the
            people you're stealing from?

                            RYOUKO
            No, but I made an exception for you.

                            TENCHI
            You can't be here, Aeka has the police
            looking all over for you.

                            RYOUKO
            I know, that's why I'm going to head
            west.

                            TENCHI
            Good, just run far away and don't look
            back.  You're in too much trouble as
            it is, I don't want to see you get
            hurt.

                            RYOUKO
            I want you to come with me.

                            TENCHI
            You –- what?!

                            RYOUKO
            SHHHHH!! <beat> Come with me out west
            Tenchi.  Run away with me, live the
            real life like we did when we were
            kids.

                            TENCHI
            I can't do that.  I'm married to Aeka,
            I have an obligation to her.

                            RYOUKO
            Ahh, screw your obligation.  Does she
            have any obligations to you, or just
            your money?

                            TENCHI
            What are you saying?

                            RYOUKO
            Come' on Tenchi, I know it and I'm not
            even married to her.  When she looks
            at you, does she see you or your
            solid gold sunglasses?  When she holds
            onto you, is she holding you or your
            Armani suit?

                            TENCHI
            I –- I don't know what you're talking
            about.

                            RYOUKO
            Come on, Tenchi, you don't have to
            keep on living with her, run away
            with me.

                            TENCHI
            This is crazy Ryouko, why did you
            come here, to rekindle your feud
            with Aeka?

                            RYOUKO
            I came here because I want to be with
            you.  Because I can't imagine a day
            rising without the ability to see
            your face.

Cut to AEKA.  She's adjusting the pictures for better viewing.  The
sound of a door shutting hard is heard from outside.  She frowns and
moves over to the door just in time to see RYOUKO shoving TENCHI
bound and gagged into his car and hopping in herself.  She stares on
in shock as the car starts and guns away.

Cut to the inside of the car.  RYOUKO is watching the road intently,
constantly checking her rear view mirrors.  Meanwhile, Tenchi is
removing the gag and ropes from around his arms.

                            TENCHI
            This is crazy.

                            RYOUKO
            You've said that already.  Try something
            new.

                            TENCHI
            Okay, you're going to get caught and
            thrown in jail.  I'm sure Aeka saw us
            leaving, she's probably called the
            police already.

                            RYOUKO
            Nah, I doubt it.

                            TENCHI
            Why's that?

                            RYOUKO
            It's not the right time yet, she's
            probably waiting for the proper light
            or to get in the right mood before
            calling the police.  She also has to
            construct the proper speech to give
            so that she sounds high and respectful.

                            TENCHI
            You really think she's that shallow?

                            RYOUKO
            I know she is. <beat> But just in case,
            I cut the phone lines.

RYOUKO grins evilly to TENCHI who merely swallows in response. Cut
to an exterior shot as they drive off past a sign that says 'CITY
LIMITS.'  Fade to white.

Fade to a cloudless night sky.  The stars shine brightly as the camera
pans downwards to show a large bridge stretching over a long bay from
one beautiful arrangement of lights to another.  A star streaks across
the sky.

                         TENCHI (O.S.)
            Will you look at that...

                         RYOUKO (O.S.)
            Hmm... shooting star.  Wanna make
            a wish?

                         TENCHI (O.S.)
            I'm not that superstitious.

Pan downwards to show RYOUKO's car parked along the coastline a ways
from the bridge.  She's lying on top of the car and watching the sky
while TENCHI sits leaning up against the car, also looking up into
the sky.  RYOUKO gets on her arm and looks down to TENCHI.

                            RYOUKO
            What superstition?  Just a little
            hopeful feeling.  A prayer that
            somewhere out there, someone is
            listening and maybe the have the
            magic to make it come true.

                            TENCHI
            Hmm...

They watch in silence for a while.  RYOUKO reaches down around the
roof and pulls out two apples from the front seat of the car.

                            RYOUKO
            Hungry?

TENCHI looks up as RYOUKO tosses an apple to him.  He catches it in
his hands and rubs it on his shirt.  RYOUKO takes a crispy bite out
of hers.

                            TENCHI
            So much talk.

                            RYOUKO
            <swallows> Huh?

                            TENCHI
            You asked how it happened.  It was a
            lot of talking and debating.  I think
            I was just a little caught up in the
            business of the matter, things were
            said and done before I'd even realized.
            One day I was just coasting along the
            next...

                            RYOUKO
            The next you were shackled to Aeka.

                            TENCHI
            I don't know about that, but I was
            married to her quite suddenly.

                            RYOUKO
            But now you see the truth, right?

                            TENCHI
            Now ... I see I've made many mistakes
            in my life and I'm not sure who or
            what I love anymore.  Except maybe..

                            RYOUKO
            <eager> Maybe? Maybe what?

                            TENCHI
            Maybe I love the silence.  The time
            without decisions, when all is tranquil
            and quiet.

                            RYOUKO
            I guess I could love the silence, if
            I was with you...

TENCHI looks up at RYOUKO who smiles warmly back.  He turns his head
back to the stars and closes his eyes.  RYOUKO lays down but hangs her
head over the edge of the roof so she can watch TENCHI.  They lay in
silence for a while longer.

                          ADAM (O.S.)
            Aha! Found 'em!

TENCHI and RYOUKO look up towards the water to see a shimmering hole
in space from which ADAM's head is sticking out of.  The hole grows
larger as he pushes it open and WASHUU can be seen behind him holding
the large, spherical, control matrix.

                            WASHUU
            There you are.

TENCHI and RYOUKO stand up.

                            TENCHI
            Miss Washuu!

                            WASHUU
            Hmm, glad to see you still remember me.

                            TENCHI
            What's going on, where are we all?

                            WASHUU
            I managed to fix my control matrix that
            SOME people graciously destroyed on me,
            but when I tried to shut down all the
            remaining realities I discovered that only
            the prime creator of the realities can
            truly shut the program down.  So we had
            come looking across half this simulation
            before we found you ... Ryouko.

                            RYOUKO
            Me?

                            WASHUU
            That's right, you were the first one to
            get to the control matrix, so you have
            host information to shut it down.

                            TENCHI
            Of course, only Ryouko could come up
            with something this weird.

RYOUKO takes a step back and looks obviously hurt.

                            WASHUU
            Well, now that we've found you, we can
            end this.  Lets go Ryouko, shut down
            this program so we can all go back to
            our normal lives.

                            RYOUKO
            No.

                             ALL
            Huh?

                            TENCHI
            Ryouko, come'on lets get out of this
            crazy world.

She looks like she on the verge of crying.

                            RYOUKO
            <sniffs> No, I don't want to go. <beat>
            Tenchi... you really want to leave?

                            TENCHI
            Well, of course.

                            RYOUKO
            Well I... <starts crying> I don't want
            to!

RYOUKO jumps off the top of the car and flies off into the city.
Everyone watches as the flies away.

                            TENCHI
            What was that all about?

                             ADAM
            I think she's upset you're so eager to
            leave.

                            TENCHI
            Why?

                             ADAM
            <sighs> Because...

Cut to RYOUKO, standing atop a semi large building looking off into
the ocean crying.

                            WASHUU
            Ryouko...

RYOUKO looks behind herself quickly then moves to jump off the
building.

                            WASHUU
            Wait!

RYOUKO stops in mid motion and slowly turns to WASHUU.

                            RYOUKO
            I'm not leaving.

                            WASHUU
            <serious> Tell me what wrong, Ryouko.

                            RYOUKO
            I –- this is my world, these are my
            dreams, but <beat> no one shares
            them with me.  I'm alone here.

                            WASHUU
            Ryouko, you're not alone, not everyone
            understands yet.  They share your
            dreams, they just see them from a
            different perspective.

                            RYOUKO
            No they don't, they think I'm weird,
            Tenchi ... Tenchi doesn't care...

RYOUKO turns away from WASHUU and silent cries some more.

                            WASHUU
            I know you're free spirited Ryouko.
            Some people see that and they think
            you're reckless and dangerous to be
            around.  <beat> But Tenchi doesn't
            see that.  He sees the emotion you
            keep inside of you, he sees the free
            spirit and smiles when you express
            that.

                            RYOUKO
            Then <sniffs> why won't he stay?

                            WASHUU
            Because he cares for a lot of people,
            and if he stays, they all must stay
            here against their will.  He can't see
            pain to anyone, especially you, but he
            has been forced into this, if he's going
            to choose to be with you, it must be
            voluntary.

                            RYOUKO
            I ... I guess...

                            WASHUU
            Come, my daughter, let us end the
            charade.

RYOUKO turns to WASHUU and nods silently.  Then she flies off towards
the harbor.

                            WASHUU
            <soft> That's my girl.

WASHUU looks down.

                          ADAM(O.S.)
            Deep in thought?

She turns around to face ADAM surprisingly.  He's standing about a
foot in front of her.

                            WASHUU
            Adam. <beat> Stop sneaking up on
            people!

                             ADAM
            It seems to be the only thing I can
            do well. <beat> Are you all right?
            You seem a little distraught.

                            WASHUU
            I'm fine. <turns> Lets get out of
            here.

WASHUU storms off screen, ADAM shrugs and follows.  Fade to white.

Fade into a view of the sun.  Pan downwards to show the giant lake
before the Masaki household.  Pan towards the house.

                         AEKA (V.O.)
            She's asleep.

Cut to AEKA and SASAMI's room.  AEKA is standing just inside the
doorway and TENCHI is standing in the hall behind her. They are
both looking at the sleeping form of SASAMI.

                            TENCHI
            She must be exhausted.

                             AEKA
            She's been that way ever since we came
            back from Washuu's reality generator.

                            TENCHI
            A few of those worlds ... they were
            pretty rough on her.

AEKA turns slowly to face TENCHI and gently grabs his hands and
holds them in her own.

                             AEKA
            They were rough on all of us.

TENCHI looks calmly between his hands and AEKA's face before backing
up further into the hall causing AEKA to break her grasp.  She looks
down at the floor.

                             AEKA
            What do you think of me, Tenchi? <beat>
            Do you think ... <beat> do you think I
            am a little too self centered, a little
            too egocentric?

                            TENCHI
            Gosh, no Aeka.

Cut to just around the corner of the same hall.  RYOUKO is leaning
against the wall and listening with an expressionless face.

                          AEKA (O.S.)
            What do you think, Lord Tenchi?

                         TENCHI (O.S.)
            What I think is ...

Cut back to AEKA and TENCHI.

                            TENCHI
            I think you have a lot of pride in
            your people, and sometimes you get
            all caught up because you think that
            people are trying to disgrace you
            and when they're doing that, they're
            disgracing all of Jurai for having
            you as a princess.

Pan backwards down the hall.

                            TENCHI
            But Aeka, you needn't defend your or
            your planet's honor.  I know you have
            it, and I think that deep down, Ryouko
            knows it too.

AEKA is silent for a few seconds.  The camera pans back until you
can see RYOUKO leaning against the corner as well as TENCHI and
AEKA talking down the hall.

                             AEKA
            Why do you think you left me in those
            worlds?

RYOUKO raises her head.

                            TENCHI
            Those were just crazy worlds, Aeka,
            who knows why anyone did anything in
            those worlds.  It's the real world
            that counts.

RYOUKO lowers her head and moves off screen.

                             AEKA
            Of course, Lord Tenchi, you're right.

Cut to the walkway up to the shrine.  RYOUKO is sitting on the steps
looking out over the lake at the setting sun.  She sighs as she
watches.

                          TENCHI(O.S.)
             It's beautiful isn't it.

RYOUKO doesn't move, but the camera pans back to show TENCHI on the
steps higher than her.  He's looking at her at first then looks up at
the horizon.

                            RYOUKO
            <flat> It's nice.

                            TENCHI
            I used to love coming down here in
            the evening when I was a kid.  I
            would just sit here and watch as the
            sun dipped below the cloud line. <beat>
            These days I don't get much of a chance
            to do it.

RYOUKO looks down for a moment, then stands and turns to TENCHI.

                            RYOUKO
            Tenchi...

                          RYOUKO(V.O.)
            <echo; overlapping> Why do you think
            I'm crazy? You love Aeka don't you.
            Why can't you understand me?  Why
            do you hate me?  You want me to
            leave don't you? I –-

                            TENCHI
            Ryouko?

RYOUKO looks up to see TENCHI holding an apple to her.

                            TENCHI
            Hungry?

RYOUKO looks at the apple and slowly reaches up to take it.

                            RYOUKO
            Share the silence with me?

TENCHI nods and sits on the steps.  RYOUKO watches him with a tearful
look in her eyes.  She sits on the step right in front of him and
looks off into the sky.  After a few moments she closes her eyes
determinedly and leans back into TENCHI.  TENCHI looks surprised for
a moment as he holds her then blinks the look away and looks back out
into the sunset.  Pan backwards away from the steps showing RYOUKO
and TENCHI sitting together, smiling, and watching the sunset.  Fade
to black.

                          WASHUU (V.O.)
            <deeper voice> It all came out all
            right in the end I suppose.

Fade into WASHUU's lab.  She's standing in her aquarium-like
laboratory while hundreds of strange creatures from all over the
galaxy swim in water filled tanks and tubes.  WASHUU looks much older
now, appearing to be a fully grown adult and talking into her shadowy
computer.  She looks sad.

                            WASHUU
            Well, except for Sasami.  She's been
            asleep ever since we came back, I don't
            know why yet, I haven't had a chance to
            do some tests.  <beat> But I guess we're
            all alive.

She paces around a bit before coming back to her computer.

                            WASHUU
            As a scientist, I must determine what
            caused the outcome of an experiment.
            Which means, basically, I must place
            blame so that the same results don't
            happen again. <beat> If I were shallow,
            I could place the blame on Ryouko and
            Aeka and everyone who used the machine
            without my permission.  But I know, that
            they wouldn't have ever used it if I
            hadn't told them about it before it was
            calibrated.  <beat> It's not their fault.

She sighs and puts her hand to her face.

                            WASHUU
            It must be mine. <beat> Everything since
            I opened my mouth has been my fault. The
            malfunction of the machine, the near
            death of Aeka at the hands of the Black
            Knight, the problems with Sasami, the
            emotional turmoil I've thrown Tenchi
            into, the havoc I've caused Adam...

She closes her eyes and whispers slowly.

                            WASHUU
            My fault. <beat> I've hurt people before.
            I won't dance around the subject, but
            the things I've created have caused not
            only death, but have been responsible for
            the destruction of entire planets and
            systems. <beat> My hands are red already.
            Why does it disgust me now? <beat> Should
            I give it up?  Will everything I invent
            be used for death and destruction? Or is
            the occasional misuse worth the lives I
            can save if I continue? <beat> Sometimes
            I envy my daughter.  She knows her path
            and would gladly give everything in this
            universe for the one she loves.  I have
            no such guidance, no such directive.  I
            have to make the difficult decisions of
            day to day.

She looks up and presses a button on her keyboard.

                            WASHUU
            This could possibly be my final entry.
            End experimental log, and close file.

She watches the screen for a few seconds without moving then turns on
her heel and walks away.  Cut to the roof of the Masaki household.  It
is night and the sky is filled with billions of stars.  WASHUU is
lying on the roof and looking up.  A star shoots across the sky.
WASHUU closes her eyes slowly then opens them after a few seconds.

                            WASHUU
            Your steps are like an elephant's, move
            more quietly.

A pair of legs walk into view and stand beside WASHUU.  The figure
bends down and lies next to WASHUU and we see it is ADAM.

                             ADAM
            Sorry.

                            WASHUU
            Why are you up here?

                             ADAM
            I could say the same for you.

                            WASHUU
            I needed some fresh air, that's all.

                             ADAM
            Well, then that's what I needed too.

WASHUU sighs and closes her eyes.  ADAM peers upwards.

                             ADAM
            Are one of those yours?

She opens her eyes and looks up again.

                            WASHUU
            You can't see it from here.  Not even the
            strongest telescope on Jurai can see my
            planet.

                             ADAM
            So you're pretty far from home?

                            WASHUU
            Yup.

                             ADAM
            Must be lonely out here in the middle of
            nowhere.  Do you miss your home?

                            WASHUU
            Do you miss *your* home town?

                             ADAM
            I don't have much of a home to miss.
            Anyone who I ever cared about is long
            gone.

                            WASHUU
            It's the same for me, my planet was
            destroyed when I was still young.
            Someday the light from it will reach
            Earth, and for a few billion years,
            I won't be able to look in the sky
            without crying.  Then, in a few
            milliseconds, it will disappear
            again, and the planet will be lost
            for good.

                             ADAM
            I'm sorry.

                            WASHUU
            Don't be. It was over 20,000 years
            ago, I've gotten over it.

                             ADAM
            Well you sure seem caught up on
            something.  <beat> Washuu, I heard you
            in your laboratory, you can't blame
            yourself for this.  It was ...
            unfortunate circumstance, don't beat
            yourself up over it.

                            WASHUU
            You don't understand ... it's not
            the first time --

                             ADAM
            And it won't be the last. <beat> You
            are a scientist, Washuu, and the
            awful truth about science is that
            sometimes people get hurt, but life
            only progresses if we learn and move
            on.

                            WASHUU
            In twenty thousand years, I've made a
            lot of mistakes.

                             ADAM
            So you've made one more.  It's good
            not to lose your humanity about it, but
            you can't torture yourself for life
            because of it as well.

                            WASHUU
            I can't keep hurting the people I love,
            I just can't do it.

ADAM reaches down and holds WASHUU's hand.

                             ADAM
            Then, don't. <beat> Learn from this and
            be more careful in the future.  Prevent
            accidents from happening, but don't
            forget that the very meaning of the word
            means that it's unexpected.  You can't
            keep them all from happening, and it
            isn't worth it to try.

WASHUU is silent for a long time.  Then she stands and pulls ADAM
with her.

                            WASHUU
            Come on.

                             ADAM
            Where are we going?

                            WASHUU
            To my lab, I'll need your help with
            the dimensional calibrators.

                             ADAM
            <shrugs; smiles> All right.

ADAM starts moving across the roof with WASHUU when he suddenly stops
and looks up into the sky.  He frowns.

                            WASHUU
            What's wrong?

                             ADAM
            I –- I don't know.  Something doesn't
            feel right.

Pan backwards into the sky from the roof.  Into the sky, through the
atmosphere, and back into space where a large metal ship is slowly
moving through space towards Earth. Flash to a hooded face that hides
the upper half with shadows.  Blue markings can be seen on the cheeks
just below the shadow and a frock of blue hair hangs in front of the
face.  Flash from there to of Earth from orbit, then a picture of a
large explosion, then a black screen that gets splashed with blood.
Cut back to ADAM and WASHUU on the roof.  He grips his head and
suddenly collapses.

                            WASHUU
            What's wrong?!

                             ADAM
            Aarrraagghh! <pants> Something is coming,
            and ... it's dangerous ... its... going
            to kill Tenchi!

WASHUU's eyes widen and she places a hand on ADAM's shoulder who's
still gripping his head in pain.  She looks up into the sky almost
with a look of fear.

Fade to black.

                             END
                 (TIME AND SPACE ADVENTURES)

Authors Notes:
        You'll have to excuse the tardiness of these two parts of Full Circle,
I have this very blatant and horrible habit of starting things with no
intention of ever ending them.  This series is a prime example of this,
The Heroes We Love is a better one.  We're talking about series I've
started and then left to die for over a YEAR.  It's not even like I'm
Zen or anything and what I write is good enough that it takes a year to
write.  I'm just some guy with an insatiable desire to write, and no
skill to write correctly.  Look, even these authors notes have terrible
grammar, I'm cursed!
        Anyway, a few things:  Pretty Sami is weird.  I mean, there are
strange things in the world of anime, and many of them weirder than PS,
but I still think it's incredibly weird.  So you have to take things
dealing with Pretty Sami with a grain of salt, since it's not really
worried about things like continuity and stuff, just 'Magical Pretty
Girl' action.  Ah, just cope.
        There is one person that I'd like to mention right now however, since
he is the one who encouraged (used loosely) me to write more of Full
Circle and to torture all of you on the FFML with it.  He is none other
than Jeff Novotny, aka Batman.  Yes, the same Jeff who helps me with As
Dark As Knight also liked Full Circle.  Go fig. Anyway, thanks Jeff.
        The future of Full Circle?  Uhh, I've got episodes 8 and 9 planned
out, but who knows when I'll have the initiative to finish both, since
they are a two part story.  If you've read Endless Nights or that
devilish fic called Honor Bound, I've accidentally let it slip what's
going to happen in FC 9.  Once again, cope.
        Found an interesting thing about copyrights the other day.
Apparently, writing a continuation to any story is perfectly legal as
long as you credit the story as being a continuation and don't claim
any of the ideas from the first as your own.  Hence...
