No need for Earth 3

The lake reflects a cast light of the full moon, giving the land its
second sun. The family of Masaki have all turned to the world of dreams,
except those who wish for dreams to turn to their world.

Ryoko hovers over her love gazing at his tranquil sleep, longing to
touch his face, to feel his body, to tell him the words that cannot be
found. Her mind cries out to him, but cannot be heard, her mouth opens
to form words that do not exist, but she dares not wake him, with her
fist clenched and tears slipping, with all her strength she mouths the
words and disappears. Tenchi pretends to sleep while watching Ryoko. Why
does she stare at him? , What does she want? , Every time he asks her,
she dose not answer, or deny that it happened, but tonight he sees, he
sees her face, he sees her body, he sees her fist clench, her mouth
move, her tears fall, then vanish.

Kaemon reclines back into the lush grass, staring at this strange pale
sun that hangs in the sky, occasionally glancing at a make shift presser
gage. Wires snake through the grass, crisscrossing the field, gathering
at a mammoth tower. Cords vine themselves up steel rods and scaffolding
giving the skeleton tower flesh. A grated platform stretches from its
head to all directions resting in the air. A dil. changes to red on the
gage, the structure hums to life, electricity surges to the center of
the platform forming a silver sphere, yet Kaemon does not
care, he dose not look, he does not wonder, he cares only for the land
of beauty that has seduce him. The surging has stopped, the humming has
died, the tower is no longer alive, the sphere is all that remains.
Hands, four hands put forth from the sphere, followed by arms,
shoulders, heads, chests, waist, legs, and feet. Two men and two women
stumble from the sphere, off the platform, to the ground, making four
loud thuds.

One of the men shouts out in vengeful passion. "I'll get you for that!"

Kaemon's voice can be faintly from across the field. "No you won't."

"Your right I won't." The man sighs defeat.

Lesson 1
"Gimme, gimme, gimme!" Washu acting like . . .  well, a twelve-year-old.
"You said you have them, now gimme!"

"Gosh, for a scientist you'd think she'd have more patience" said one of
the women.

Washu addresses her. "I have patience for only two things, and this is
not one of them."

Kaemon lets out a long sigh. "Just give them to her."

"Introduce us first." One of the men speaks up.

"Alright, alright." Striving to conceal his frustration. "Washu this is
the guys, guys this is Washu. Happy!"

"No!"

"Ok. Washu this is Hastings." A man from Kaemon's right steps forth and
bows. "This is Narah." Nodding to the woman on  his left, Narah steps
forth and bows. "This is Baci." The woman smiles and waves. "And this is
Makoto." The man bows. "We're common peoples."

"So these are your great Science Academy assistants huh?"

"ASSISTANTS!" Baci roars.

Kaemon brakes out into a nervous laugher. Makoto violently shakes Kaemon
while Baci and Narah clobber him repeatedly. Hastings comely asks Washu.
"What kind of lies did he tell you?"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I wonder if he has a girl friend yet." Sasami day dreams in history
class, eyeing the boy two rows ahead of her.

Sasami has been in school for a year now, celebrating her fifteenth
birthday a few months ago. Her school received a transfer student four
month ago, his name was Yokiuu, fifteen, and from Tokyo. For four months
she thought about him more than she would want to admit, now she can't
stop obsessing about him. Her friends constantly encourage her to talk
to him, but she's so shy around boys, especially this boy, the only boy
other than Tenchi she truly likes. So now she watches him from a
distant, building up cordage, with gouges pink eyes and goofy smile.

"Ms. Masaki!"

Sasami bolts her head up off the desk, gone is her look of happiness
replaced with that of remorse. She has also taken the name "Masaki" so
no one would question her family.

"Have you been listening?!"

"Yes Halrou sensei." Sasami lower her head.

"Then tell me what I was talking about."

Sasami takes a deep breath. "You were talking about how I can tell you
what you were talking about." The class starts giggling.

"Silence!" her screech stops the giggling dead. Sasami could feel the
teacher's hateful glare burrowing into her skull. "I will see you after
class Ms. Masaki."

Sasami cringes at her icy voice. "Yes Halrou sensei." She raises her
head catching Yokiuu's warm smile, his eyes admiring her courage, she
blushes and downs her head to the desk. The class begins again.

Lesson 2
"Here they are." Makoto shows Washu seven small seeds at resembles gems.

"These are the real seeds?" she asks visually inspecting them.

"I guarantee these are the real seeds--"

"Or your money back."Narah cuts in.

"Store credit only." Kaemon shouts from across the laboratory,
inspecting the bruises Baci and Narah gave him.

Makoto, Baci, Narah, and Hastings slowly glance an evil eye his way.
Washu snatches the seeds from the distracted group and runs off. Acting
on pure instinct, Hastings shoots her in the back, stopping the theft.
The group rushes over to the life less body.

Baci asks. "You weren't trying to kill her where you?

"Uh, no?" He sheepishly answers

The mad scientist begins moaning and the group breathes a heavy sigh of
relief. Metallic vines lunge from the void, restraining and lifting the
group into the air. Kaemon also falls victim to the assault, a vine
tares off his band, dropping it next to the scientist.

"This wasn't part of the deal Washu!" Kaemon yells.

"Shooting me in the back wasn't part either, but our deal is nothing mor
than a verb le agreement that I can't remember."

"You what!?" they holler in unison.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Aeka puts up her feet after a slow day of serving drinks, a really slow
and prosperous day. In the last five hours she has been promoted to the
assent manager, all of this was do to the fact that the manager and
assent manager (who were sleeping together) broke up yesterday, the
manager fired the assent and gave Aeka the job.

Aeka takes another look for customers, none. Her mind wanders back to
yesterdays events, holding Tenchi close, trying to ease his troubled
nerves, hearing his breathing, feeling his heart beat, that moment felt
so right to her, she wishes it can stay like that forever, her love
Tenchi. Her memory changes. Achika, his deceased mother, alive, it does
not seem right, if she's dead why is she here, could Tsunami have
brought her back? , but for what reason and why erase her memory. Aeka
rubs her temples from the confusion.

"I should call Tenchi to tell him my good fortune." She reaches for the
phone.

*ring*ring*
Tenchi: Hello?
Aeka: Lord Tenchi, hello.
Tenchi: Oh, hello Aeka.
Aeka: Can you get off for lunch? , I have the most wonderful news for
you.
Tenchi: Um.
Aeka: I'll pay, your treat.
Tenchi: I'm sorry Aeka I can't, they're making me work through lunch
again.
Aeka: Oh.
Tenchi: Maybe some other time.
Aeka: Yes, some other time.
Aeka hears background noises on Tenchi's line.
Tenchi: I have to go, my boss is coming.
Aeka: Al-alright, good bye Lord-
*dial tone*
Aeka: . . . Tenchi.

Lesson 3
"What are you going to do with us?" Narah asks.

"I can always use more spare parts." Washu taunts the helpless group
from her floating chair. Having already begun testing the seeds.

"You don't understand, I own these seeds. You can't just start using
them with them without my consent." Kaemon exclaims.

"Oh I'm sorry, I'll remember that next time." She coos.

"I don't think you under stand." Kaemon manages to snaps his fingers.
Each seed dully glow a pale blue light, vanishes, and reappears hovering
around Kaemon. " I OWN these!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Tenchi I need those reports by the end of the day."

"Yes sir." Tenchi sighs watching his boss leave.

He's had this job for three months and hated every passing moment, at
times he's even forgotten what his job really is, regretting not taking
his father's offer for a job. He always wanted a normal life, normal
job, normal family, now he has a normal job and a partially normal life,
and no longer cares for ether.

"Tenchi."

He turns his chair around to the voice and sees his only reason for
staying in this dead end job.

Lesson 4
"Is that so?" Yosho sips his tea after hearing Washu's predicament.
Kaemon, Yosho, and Washu deliberate in the kitchen while Narah,
Hastings, Makoto, and Baci watch television in the living room.

"Well?" Washu impatiently asks.

"Yes they may stay, but Kaemon and the others will have to earn their
keep." He faces Kaemon. "We have the recently neglected carrot fields,
and a newly destroyed shrine grounds."

"Restore a shrine or pull carrots, hmm, I'll have to go with the
carrot." Kaemon gets an uneasy feeling from Yosho's grin.

Washu whispers into Kaemon's ear. "If I where you I'd have picked the
shrine."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A camera shutter clicks away capturing a baby's laugher.

"Ryoko, I'm losing light!" bellows the photographer in a heavy French
accent.

"Yeah, yeah."She sighs adjusting a white board, then moves behind the
man awaiting her next ‘French' order. She makes a face catching the
baby's attention. The laugher suddenly increases, drowning out the
camera shutter. The photographer hurls his camera at a wall and storms
off shouting obscenity in French. Other assents take the baby to its
parents and begin setting up the next shoot while Ryoko lies on a couch
easing her stressed nerves.

For a year she has been keeping her anger under check, but this job was
driving her up the wall. No one has stayed in this job for more than a
week, but she kept this job for two months, braking the previous assents
record by 43 days. She thinks back to yesterday. Kaemon, artificial
Jurian energy, if Juri energy can be artificially made, what about her?
, can her powers be copied and/or duplicated for anyone to freely use?
"Mother vowed never to make another me, but that doesn't stop others
from playing God, I don't trust him."

"Ryoko, I no need you for this shoot, go home." The photographer checks
his camera. Ryoko rolls off the couch, flicks him the finger, and heads
out the door.

Lesson 5
Narah, Baci, Hastings, and Makoto are watching tv.

"I don't get this magical girl show at all." Baci shakes her head.
"Change the channel Makoto."

Sasami cheerfully enters the house with her living hat Ryo-oh-ki. "I'm
home!" she strolls passes the living room and sees four new people. "Who
are you?" she asks the group.

"They are our new house guests." Yosho exits the kitchen. "They'll be
helping around the house and shrine."

Makoto: Hello.
Hastings: We're good friends of Kaemon.
Baci: Is that a rat on your head?

"Meow!" Ryo-oh-ki hisses.

"No this is Ryo-oh-ki." She removes the cabbit and holds her for the
group to see.

"What's a ‘Ryo-oh-ki'?" Narah asks.

"Ryo-oh-ki is her name. She's a cabbit." Sasami answers.

"Then what's a cabbit?" Narah asks again.

"An obese fur hat." Baci teases.

"Meow meow meow, meow!" Ryo-oh-ki struggles free from Sasami's grasp and
in one bound, leaps across the room pummeling Baci in the stomach.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mihoshi's steps echo thru the hall on her way to the counsel meeting.
She freezes in her tracks as the counsel door appears before her. Her
heart races, palms sweat, breathing shortens, and mouth dries as the
door opens. Her career record's disk falls from her hand making an
echoing clack. She jumps at the sound, then realizes she's making the
counsel wait. Picking up her disk, Mihoshi runs through the door into a
colosseum like room, the room is empty save for a few counsel members,
in the center is a small podium with a disk drawer open. Mihoshi
nervously walks to the podium counting the shadows.

She places her disk in the drawer and speaks in a commanding tone.
"Detective first class-"

"We know who you are Miss Mihoshi." The head counsel member cuts her
off. "Do you know why you are here?"

"Yes, you black flagged my last report."

"Why we flagged your report is . . . that we have received countless
complaints from your superiores about these reports you hand in. The
last two weeks we had certified doctors run tests on how your report
effect the mettle competence of other GP officers, and of 72 hours ago
we received the results." The speaker took a deep breath. "Work
efficiency: up 3%."

"Wow, I thought this was going to be bad." Mihoshi sighed relief.

"I'm not finished! Early retirement: up 7%, High test scores: down 22%,
Bad grammar: up 18%, Burnt food: up 1%, Suidae: up 10%, Mettle brake
downs: up 47%, People getting lost: up 50%, Plain stupidity: up 91%, a
plant died from light reflecting off your report. Miss Mihoshi, your
reports are a threat to the entire station! We cannot have you running
around writing reports any more! Your rein of terror ends here!" tears
run rivers down Mihoshi's cheeks. "But after a request from your
grandfather we have decided that firing will only endanger the universe.
We have unanimously-" *coughing in the back ground* "-chosen to promote
you to a poison where you don't have to write any reports what-so-ever.
As of now you are the commanding officer to the Spacial Fugitive
Investigation Unit, congratulations."

Mihoshi drys her tears. "But what about Kiyone? , she'll be so lonely
without me."

"Kiyone is more than qualified to handle patrols on her own, we'll send
a Second Class Detective to gain field experience. Is there anything you
need before we send you off?"

Mihoshi puts a finger to her chin. "Hmm, there is one thing." *a glass
brakes in the background*

Lesson 6
Aeka removes her shoes at the foot of the Masaki home, her face beaming
with delight. She has chosen to tell the family of her premonition over
dinner, timing it just as Ryoko is swallowing her food so she couldn't
make an insult without choking.

"Out of my way stupid princess." Ryoko flies in, pushing her out of the
door way.

Aeka regains her footing. "Miss Ryoko! Is there no end to your
rudeness!" she fumes.

"Of course there is, I just have to find it first. And thank you in
helping me to reach my goal." Ryoko coys.

Aeka grabs her roughly by the cuff. "There is noting in this world that
can spoil my mood today, not even you Ryoko have that kind of power."

"Wanna bet?"

"10,000 yen?"

"Deal."

The princess and the demon shake hands sealing their unearthly bargain,
then move into the dining room.

"Hello?" Aeka says upon entering the room.

"Where are the snacks?" Ryoko says after.

Both stop in their tracks, seeing the young man from yesterday talking
with Washu.

They shout in unison. "You!" Pointing at Kaemon.

He mocks them back. "Me!"

"Hello, you two remember Kaemon right?" Washu grins.

"Yes, and this morning you said he left!" says a disbelief Aeka.

"Yes I did, and now he's back."

"Why?!"

"So I can study the seeds simple-minded girl. He seems to have some
control over the seeds, meaning I can't study them without him around. I
spoke with Lord Yosho in letting Kaemon stay and he has agreed with it."

The two women face fault. "B-but he groped me!" Ryoko stammered.

"That was only in self defense. And you enjoyed it." Kaemon smirked.

It was Aeka's turn to stammer. "H-he can't live here, he's a threat to
the Jurians."

"No, the seeds are, I just own them."

Ryoko draws her sword. "You're not leaving this room with all your limbs
attached." Aeka fallows suit, charging up her logs.

Kaemon shows them his wrists. "You can't fight me like that, I don't
have my band."

"Fine!" they shout deactivating their weapons.

Kaemon tips back his chair as Ryoko pounces on him. Flipping her over
him, Kaemon throws the chair at her for good measure. Ryoko rights
herself, catching the chair before landing. Aeka starts throwing punches
left and right. Kaemon leaps over the table to avoid getting hit,
landing on Washu instate. Ryoko jump kicks Kaemon, but he dives into the
kitchen and she nails Washu, breaking the chair.

"I'm sorry mom!" Ryoko abandons the pursuit, in favor of picking up the
broken chair.

Makoto and Sasami's attention are pulled away from cooking to Kaemon
rolling in and Aeka dashing in after. Aeka does a low kick, hitting him
in the knee. He stumbles back and flings open the fridge door on the
advancing Aeka. The door halts movement upon hitting her hand, she then
pushes the door back on him. Kaemon jumps on top of the refrigerator,
that moment Ryoko flies in the room, he kicks open the freezer door
letting her fly into it head first. Gravity sets in letting her fall on
Aeka. Kaemon hops off the fridge and lands on the ajar refrigerator
door, braking it off its hinges. He falls onto his back while the door
falls onto the backs of the girls. He stands in time to see Aeka lift
both Ryoko and the door up over her head, then toss them aside like two
sticks. In a blur Aeka pounds Kaemon to the floor with a barrage of
punches and kicks, Ryoko grabs his neck from behind and holds him off
the floor.

Aeka prepares to finish him off. "You are a threat to the Jurian empire
and must be dealt with immediately."

"Stop! Both of you!" Sasami shrieks.

"Let him go, he hasn't done anything!" Makoto hollers.

Aeka wheels around. "He knows of Juri power. He could use it against
us."

"He knows how to extract it, not make it." Makoto go's on Kaemon's
defense.

"But he attacked me with--"

"That was a different kind of energy, it was in no way Jurian." Makoto
cuts off Ryoko. "And I've been his friend far to long to know he would
never use such a power in that way."

Aeka charges her logs, then realize the scene in front of her. Sasami in
her kimono and apron, cooking with a stranger clamming to be a friend of
Kaemon. If they were a threat, Sasami would never have let them get so
close to this family. Sasami has some how always been able to find the
goodness in people she meets in her life long before anyone else could,
and Aeka knew that.

Aeka disarms herself. "I'm sorry Sasami and Mr. . . . , er."

"Makoto."

"Mr. Makoto, I am sorry I acted in such a irresponsible and irrational
way, please forgive me." Aeka looks over her shoulder. "Miss Ryoko
please let him go."

"Too late, he passed out."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Kiyone makes her drudging march up the Masaki steps, a small price to
pay for living cheap. This day her carry load was much lighter, for her
partner was off at Galaxy Police being reprimanded for God knows what.
All Kiyone knows a black flag is very bad, meaning Mihoshi is getting
transferred. Just the thought of Mihoshi being transferred far away from
her, is the kind of motivation she needs to get thru the day.

Kiyone's cell phone rings. *ring*ring*

"Hello?"

"Kiyone!" an over active blonde answers.

"Hi Mihoshi." Kiyone sighs. (After pleading with officials, GP made a
communicator that resembles a celluorphone for both detectives) "how was
your meeting."

"Bad, they wanted to fire me."

"Really?!" Kiyone almost squeals.

"Then they wanted to transfer me."

"Uh-huh." she hangs on every word.

"Then they decided to promote me."

"What?" Kiyone face faults.

"Yup. I am now the commander of the SFIU."

"But, but, but, . . ."

"And while I was there I got you a present."

Images of ugly dresses, half-eaten food, and used gift certificates
flood her mind. "What did you get me?" she hastate.

"What is the one thing in the world you want most?"

"A Pez dispenser with suicide tablets."

"Kiyone you're so silly. I pulled some strings and got you a promotion."

"Huh?" she face faults again.

"Starting two weeks from tomorrow you're the new assistant co-producer
of important things to the commander of the SFIU. I'm going to be your
boss, aren't you excited?"

"N-, wha-, there is no such position Mihoshi!" she blurts out.

"There is now."

Lesson 7
Tenchi plays back the plan in his mind.

Walk in, shout hello, Aeka and Ryoko come at me with hugs, they start
fighting, I duck out, head to shrine, ask grandfather where mother is,
find mother, spend quality time.

Tenchi enters the house. "Hello!"

"Tenchi!" squealing come from the living room.

He prepares for the next part. But instate of Aeka and Ryoko coming to
greet him, Baci, Hastings, Narah, and Makoto lach onto him.

"Lord Tenchi, one of Washu's inventions got out of hand and look what
happened to us." Narah clings to him.

"A-Aeka?" asks an utterly bewildered Tenchi.

Narah holds his face and squirts some fake tears. "Yes! Oh Lord Tenchi,
I knew you would see passed this fake body."

Hastings pulls Tenchi away from Narah. "What about me Tenchi?"

Baci grabs Tenchi and points down the hallway. "Tenchi look! It's our
evil clones, protect us!"

Ryoko, Aeka, Sasami, and Washu stare wide eyed.
Ryoko: Hey!
Aeka: Remove Lord Tenchi.
Sasami: What are you doing?
Washu: Which one's me!

"I am!" Makoto enthusiastically raises his hand. Without hesitation Aeka
and Ryoko bum rush the group.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Achika, daughter of Yosho, mother of Tenchi, sits by a stream watching
the reflection of her face in the slow-moving water. She touches the
reflection, distorting it beyond recognition, that's how she feels. So
long she's waited to come back to this place, to see her son, her
father, her husband. They've changed, they've all changed, everything's
changed, even her. A new life is what they have, without her.

Achika talks to herself. "All those years gone, now I'm back." *thump*
"I can barely remember why I left at all." *thump* "That little red
haired girl . . . she reminds me-" *thump* "of someone familiar."
*thump*  "Why did I leave this place?"  *thump* "That door."  *thump*
"That room." *thump*  "That dark room." Achika stops talking out loud.
"That place."  *thump* "That bad place." Achika holds her head and
closes her eyes. "Why can't I remember?" *thump*  "What happen back
then."  *thump* "Why can't I remember."

"Achika." A familiar voice calls out.

Lesson 8
The house of Masaki once again teamed with life, the sound of drunken
laugher wailed from the roof, and playful antics sounded the porch.
Music playing ricochets off walls, while silent aroma of food
illuminates through open windows. A banging pot beckon people to dinner,
and the sounds of conversion could be heard exiting the house, halting
only for Ryoko's choking. The house of Masaki was no longer a house of
dead wood, but a living, breathing home.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nobuyuki didn't even bother returning home after work, instate he went
looking for his long forgotten love. His first choice was the shrine,
but she wouldn't be there, she would go to a place only they know, a
place of memories for both of them, their Avalon. He knew the way by
heart, he prayed and wept there countless times after death, yet this
time he was not going to pray or cry, but to see. Her features have aged
like himself, but he can still see the beautiful young woman he courted
in high school. He sees her hold her head, something's wrong.

He call's out to her. "Achika."

Achika looks for the voice's origin and finds Nobuyuki, her sweet smile
melts his heart, she stands and moves to him. He has dreamed of this
place and her so many times before and woken up, this time it's for
real, her hand is real, her face is real, her body is real, she is real.
He holds her close, a tear rolls down his cheek.

Her smile still un faded she asks. "Tell me, why did I leave."

Nobuyuki pauses then answer. "You said you needed sometime to think it
through."

"Think what through?"

"You don't remember?"

Achika blushes. "Of corse I remember, I, uh, wanted your side."

Nobuyuki smiles, he has her on the ropes. "Our marriage. It happened
after Tenchi was born, I admit I was a complete ass then, but I've
changed now, I'm no longer like that."

"Yes, I remember."

He thinks to himself. "She fell for it. I'm so good."

"Do you remember when we used to come here and wile away the hours
talking?" she asks him.

"Or holding each other like this. This was also the place I purposed to
you."

"I want those days back Nobuyuki." Achika whimpers in his chest.

"So do I." Nobuyuki feels her tears wetting his shirt. "But we can't."
He dries her tears. "All we can do now is start over, from the
beginning."

Achika takes a step back, smiles, and extends her hand. "Hi. I'm
Achika."

Nobuyuki blinks then takes her hand, pulling her close. "I'm Nobuyuki."

"I think I'm falling in love with you Nobuyuki."

He gets down on one neck. "Then will you marry me Achika?"

She takes her hand back and turns away. "But I hardly know you."

Nobuyuki wraps his arms around her waist and whispers in her ear. "We
have all of eternity to learn."

She turns and wraps her arms around his neck. "All right."

They pull into each other, her smile turns seductive. She quickly pecks
his lips, toying with him. He tilts his head into hers and kisses the
lips he thought he could never again feel upon his own.
