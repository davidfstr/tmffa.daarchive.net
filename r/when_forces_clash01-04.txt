Act 1 Scene 4

(this scene takes place straight after the figure has fallen onto the floor 
of
Washu's lab. It is a little girl with cyan coloured hair much the same as
Ryoko's apart from it has black streaks in it and gold eyes.)

Washu - (looks down at the figure and examines it) Well...she's still alive 
but
unconscious. She looks to be about 6 years old and she has a high power 
level.
Sasami - What does that mean Washu??
Washu - That means that she's not from Earth, she's not human. A human's 
power
level is 10. Her's is 200.
Sasami - Wow!!
Washu - It's not very high though (points a machine at Sasami) Your power 
level
is 100 Sasami. (goes over to Ayeka) Yours is 120 Ayeka. (goes over to 
Mihoshi)
Yours is 50 Mihoshi. (goes over to Kiyone) And yours is 49 Kiyone.
Sasami - What are Ryoko's and Tenchi's power levels?
Washu - Well, Tenchi's and Ryoko's are exactly the same. They both have 500
power level points EACH!!!
Sasami - Wow!! What's yours Washu??
Washu - Well...mine is very high!!
Sasami - What is it Washu??
Washu - 10 million points.

(Everyone gasps)

Sasami - Woah!! That is very high Washu!
Washu - Well, I am a goddess after all.
Sasami - Yeah. (looks at the girl on the floor) Will she be alright Washu?
Washu - Yes, she should be fine. However, I would like to put her in a 
container
away from any contact except myself. She may be small but she could still be
dangerous.
Ayeka - Yes, we must be careful.
Kiyone - Well, this is a surprising turn-out. This will be very interesting 
to
write up in our report Mihoshi.
Mihoshi - Yes it will be Kiyone.
Kiyone - And as usual, you caused it. One day, you will be the death of me,
Mihoshi!
