Welcome to galaxy police home of 2 million police officers not including the ones on patrol! 
The lift door opened slowly the man stepped out of the lift and walked down the hallway
until he came to a door labeled "Section Chief". 
He knocked loudly on the door. "Enter" came a elder voice.
Upon entering the room the section chief stood up and shook the younger man's hand. 
"Greetings Cypres how are you?"   "I am well sir, sir? You requested me?" 
"Yes I did Cypres." The chief cleared his voice and spoke. "Cypres after the destruction of
the main capital building on cukunda the council has decided that you should be relocated so
as my last order as section chief you will be moved to the solar system." "Sir" he paused "um
doesn't detective Mihoshi and Kyone run that system?" The chief nodded. "Yes indeed they do
and you are to give these to them as well." He handed to envelopes to Cypres. "That is all."
After leaving the office Cypres quietly walked down the hall.

Episode 1 "No need for a problem"
Tenchi liked to at lest once a week look back on his life Ryoko and Aeka were at it again yelling 
at each other again Sasami cooked a good breakfast and had another bad dream Mishoshi and Kyone
still choose to live by them selves in their apartment and Washu hadn't left her lab in 4 days.
Tenchi sighed " Why me?" Tenchi wondered a question he had no answer to for 3years now.
Tenchi was about to cut from his thoughts and get back to work when all of a sudden, He had heard
a loud sound one of the very air being cut!
Tenchi looked up, What he saw took his breath away he inhaled deeply and swallowed his breath.
"Oh please don't be trouble!" Tenchi prayed to him-self as he stared at the ship braking through
the clouds. 
The ship was shaped like Ken-ohki but it had a main crystal sticking out of the top and a odd 
dark purple color to it.
The ship turned into a white light and there over the ship stood a man in an galaxy police outfit
the man was about tenchi's height had long forest green hair his face was sharp and closely
reminded him of Mihoshi's cheerful face.
"High low, you must be tenkey mizuki!" He said sounding pleased with the way 
he had said it.
Tenchi replied "hum hi my name is Tenchi Misaki may I help you?"
The officer head sweated "Oh so it is." And crossed something off on a billboard.
"Yes Tenkey could you tell me where officers Kionea & Mihozhi?"
Tenchi gave the young man a weird look and said.
"You mean Kyone and Mihoshi?" "Tenchi said confused.
The young man scribbled on the billboard again.
"Yah that's them!" He said sounding pleased in his deducing abilities
"Yes they'll be here later today won't you come in?" Tenchi replied 
"Um... oh okay."  The young man said quietly.
***********************************************************************
The door to the house opened Sasami came to the door.
"Ah Tenchi hello, who is this with you?"
The young man came forward.
"High low Princess.." The man looked at his billboard "Aeka" He finished 
"Um my name is Sasami" She corrected him.
"Oops sorry princess." he bowed to Sasami 
"That's all right are you staying for dinner?" She asked with a hope filled voice.
"Umm okay." He said uneasy.
"Sasami this is..." Tenchi said realizing that he didn't know the young mans name.
"Oh um my name is Ryoko..." "I mean Cypres sorry I was look at my billboard" 
Cypres corrected himself.
 "Cypres is waiting for Mihoshi and Kyone." Tenchi finished.
"Oh well they aren't here."  Sasami said.
"Oh cabbit wagging" he said to himself.
"Well..." Cypres said putting his hand behind his head. "Could anyone show me around?" Cypres 
asked.

********************************************************************************
Ryoko laid on the roof "how am I going to get rid of Aeka and get Tenchi"
She said to herself.
Ryoko reaized long ago that she has thought about this probably more then she needed
to.
"But I won't let aeka have him." She said to herself.
About then she saw Tenchi walking towards the house with someone.
"Hu? Who is that?" she said watching.
"Hey that's a galaxy police outfit!" Ryoko said with hate.
"They already know I'm here!" "So why?"
Ryoko said teleporting down stairs.
******************************************************************************
Aeka sat in the den when she heard the door slide open. 
"Ah Tenchi must be home." She said with glee.
Geting up to go to the door.
*****************************************************************************
Ryo-ohki Jumped again. "Missed" she thought to herself Ryo-ohki continued to look at the carrot
Balancing just on the edge of the table. Then she hear the door open. 	
"Tenchi must be home" Ryo-ohki thought.
Abandoning the carrot Ryo-ohki ran for the door.
*****************************************************************************
All at once Ryoko, Ryo-ohki and Aeka came in.
"Oh." Said Cypres "You he said pointing at Aeka must be the space pirate Ryoko and you."
Pointing at Ryoko "Must be Princess Aeka and this..." Pointing at Ryo-ohk. "Must be Nagi the
bountey hunter." Cypres Smiled Unaware of the power of to angered females and the're full
power ready to show the new comer how to pronounce their names
