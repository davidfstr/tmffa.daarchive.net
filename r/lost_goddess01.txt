blondie in Tenchi's dream, and Mikaishe...or mikai
same person)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was night and Tenchi and his grandpa were doing
some sword-fighting. Tenchi was actually losing
between his grandpa(as always) and he knew why hew has
to train so much. He doesn't know his purpose and he
thinks he never will know.

"OK tenchi that's enough for now" said his grandpa.
Tenchi put his hands on his knees and tooked big
breaths because he's so tired.
"Tenchi tell your dad that I'll be at the shrine K?
Good night" said Yosho(grandpa).
"good night grandpa" said tenchi, and he walked to his
place where Ryoko and Ayeka were fighting.
~They're STILL fighting for a dumb movie?!~ thought
Tenchi and rolled his eyes and walked up the stairs
not interrupting their arguement.
Tenchi went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and
went to bed. He was so tired that he didn't want to
take a bath!
~I'll take a bath tomorrow and I gotta go with Sasami
to the marketplace also tomorrow.~ thought Tenchi and
went to sleep.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note: What Im about to write is what Tenchi's
dreaming.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was night and Tenchi was relaxing in a garden of
roses of many colors; pink, white, red and yellow.
Then the most beautiful girl appeared in front of him.
She was floating through the air. The girl had loong
blond hair(bangs) the most glowing purple eyes, and
her skin soft and she was wearing a gray dress as long
as herself and her body was surrounded by a glowing
blue light.
Tenchi was sorta scared.
"Don't fear" said the girl.
"Who are you? what do you want?" Tenchi said thinking
tha the girl was evil.
She stares at Tenchi.  and she layed in front of him.
She gently placed her lovely hands on Tenchi's head
and closed her eyes.
"I see that your battling skills are weak and I know
how you feel, of losing so much between battles vs.
your grandpa. The same thing happened to me."
"Yeah. I'm cocentrating so much on winning that i
always lose."
"Is that rite?" she said still with her hands on his
head.
"I see your grandpa trains you well...but not as well
as he should be."
"Do you know why your training so much?" she asked
him.
"No I don't." Tenchi said sadly.
"Tell your grandpa that he doesnt have to train you
anymore."
"WHAT?!" Tenchi said."Why?"
"Your grandpa is getti
ng very very sick and iknow how much he wants youu to
improve on your fighting."
"I know." said Tenchi.
"I'll bring you a sub down to Earth in the morning-"
"but Im going with a friend of mine to the
marketplace!" said Tenchi.
"I'll tell her to be there and look for you."
"Wait a sec" he said.
"IS A SHE?!" he asked nervously." oh man! i already
got 6!"
"Do they bother you?" she said.
"Yes.. A LOT!"
"Mikaishe isn't a pain in the butt! She's extremly
nice!" she said.
"Oh ok" he said.
"Well I gotta go now" she said and disappeared.
And Tenchi went back to sleep.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Its morning and Sasami woke Tenchi to go to breakfast.
Tenchi dressed up and was ready to eat.

"TENCHI baby how ya doin?" Ryoko hugged him around the
neck(he almost choked).
"Fine Ryoko" Tenchi said struggling to get her off.
"Ryoko!! Get off of Lord Tenchi!" said Ayeka pulling
her off of Tenchi...
(after all that noise finished..)
Tenchi and Sasami went to the marketplace.
"So what do we have to buy?"asked Sasami.
"lets see.." he took a list of groceries to buy.
"uhh, Tea, baking powder, sugar candy, oatmeal, frozen
chicken,  and uhh, more tea."
"Ok lets go!" said sasami and got her basket.
"Tenchi? Last night you woke me up." she said.
"I did? How?" he asked.
"You said something about i have 6 already or
something. You have 6 what?"
"You won't uderstand" said Tenchi. "you'll find out
for yourself later on." he smiled. Sasami smiled back.
"Here's the Tea"said Samami.
~~~~
and they kept buying all the things in the list.
~~~~
"Got everything?" asked Tenchi.
"Yep!" Sasami replied.
They went to the cashier and placed their food on a
table.
"Your amount is $45 please." he said. Tenchi reached
to his pocket and there was only $30!
"Do you accept checks?" Tenchi asked.
"NOO!!!!" he yelled.
"All right..." Tenchi said nervously.
"I'll pay the rest." a voice said. A girl payed the
$15 Tenchi needed to buy everything. the girl had
green eyes and long navy hair(no bangs)."hey thanks"
said Tenchi.
"sure anytime" she said and disappeared through the
crowd of people. Tenchi went back to what he was doin.

~~~
back home when they arrived..
~~~
Ryoko was eating an apple on top of a tree, Ryo-ki was
sleeping using a carrot as a pillow inside the living
room, ayeka was outside planting her flowers which
were doing much better after ryoko destroyed them on
purpose. his dad was at work as always, and Tenchi
guessed his grandpa was at the shrine.
~I havent seen that girl yet~ Tenchi thought.
He sat on the couch and sighed.
"why hello Tenchi" said ayeka with a flower on her
hand.
"Hi Ayeka" said Tenchi."I had the most strangest dream
last night" he said.
"Oh what was it about?" she asked him. She sat down
next to him.
"I dreamed the I was in a garden of roses and this
pretty girl surrounded by blue light told me that
grandpa shouldnt train me anymore." he said.
"What? Why?" asked ayeka.
"She told me that he's getting sick or something and
she'll bring a sub to replace him until he gets better
or something."
"Oh my goodness I just hope that Yosho gets better."
"But the weirdest thing of all is that the sub is a
she" he said.
"WHAT?!" asked ayeka with anger. Her eyes were with
fire and her face was totally red.
"don't get angry! shes only a sub we wont do nothin
between each other except just practice. ok?" said
tenchi.
"all right. But DONT trick me!" she said concernly.
"ok." Tenchi stood from the couch and headed to the
kitchen to get a glass of water. He opened the
refrigirator and took a gallon of water out. He closed
the refrigirator and went to the cabinets and took a
glass cup, poured in the water. He then put the gallon
of water in the refrigirator, then closed it. He
grabbed the glass of water very gently so it won't
spill to the floor. Then climbed the stairs and walked
to his room, and closed the door behind him(AND locked
it also.)He jumped to his bed all tired.. and doze off
in his slumber......

When it was already night.....

Tenchi finally woke up and finished drinking his glass
of water. He got out of his room, walked down the
stairs, and stopped in the living room and he saw
everyone Mihoshi, Kiyone, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Washu
and his dad in the living room all with sad looks on
their faces.

"Hey everyone what's wrong?" he asked.
"Dad's sick" said Masaki(Tenchi's dad)
"He's now at the shrine with those big logs or whateva
they are." said Ryoko.
"didn't you know about it Tenchi?" asked Sasami.
"yes i knew it all before you guys ever did." he said.

"What do you mean?" asked washu.
"I'll tell you guys later."
"Why can't you tell us now son?" asked Masaki.
"Well all right" said Tenchi. And so he did.....

After he explained his weird dream.......

"WWWWWHHHHAAAATTTT??!!" yelled Ryoko.
"the sub is a she im sorry but it is..." said Tenchi
nervously. Ryoko murmured angryly to herself.
"The girl told me that she knew you Ryoko." said
tenchi calmly. (its a lie just so she could feel
better)
"In a bad way? or in a good way?" asked Ryoko still
with her angry voice.
"I dunno. All i know is that just knows you.
Now EVERYONEo(except Yosho) was in the living room...

The door knocked.

Everyone got scared and Ryoko jumped into Tenchi's
arms pretending that she was mortified. Tenchi made a
sweat drop. The door knocked again but no one paniced.

"Someone get the door" whispered Masaki.
"Maybe that's Yosho's sub Tenchi" said Sasami staring
at him. Tenchi took Ryoko off his arms.
"yeah tenchi answer the door" said everyone.
Tenchi walked to the door very nervously. He faced the
door and then opened it.
There he saw a girl standing in front of him now. The
girl had dark green eyes and very dark navy hair.(she
had no bangs in the hair) She was wearing a green no
sleeve shirt and gray pants. She had on a silver
necklace with a cross attached to it. Everyone was in
the window listening..
"M-m-may I help you?" asked tenchi.
"Hi I'm Mikaishe and im looking for Tenchi Masaki?"
she asked nicely.
"Um IM tenchi Masaki." he said."and your that girl
that paind for me in the marketplace!"
"Oh really? I didnt know that YOU were my student. Um
Im gonna take place for your grandpa and continue your
training" she said.
"HELLO THERE!!!" interrupted Masaki and standed beside
Tenchi.
"So you must be Mikaishe right?" he asked.
"Yeah...." she responded.
"WELCOME TO THE MASAKI RESIDENCE!!!" he said happily
and gave Mikaishe and tight tight TIGHT hug.
Mikaishe was grunting in pain because he was hugging
her so hard. THEN he finnally let go.
"Thanks mr...uhhh..."
"call me masaki" and they both shaked hands.
"Come on in!" he said.
Mikaishe stepped inside the house and looked around.
she had her hands in her pockets.
"ok let me introduce you to the rest to the residents
of this place." said Tenchi.
"OK"
He pointed to a pink haired girl.
"That's Washu" he said.
"Hi there!" she greeted.
"Hi"
Tenchi pointed to a 700 year old lady.
"That's Ryoko" he said. Ryoko had her arms crossed and
gave Mikaishe a bad look. She gave her back to
Mikaishe.
"Hello." she said rudely.
"hi" Mikaishe said tryijng to not get worried or
anything. Tenchi had another sweatdrop.
Then Tenchi pointed to the crown princess of Jurai.
"That's Ayeka" he said.
"Hello there Mikaishe" said Ayeka nicely. She bowed.
"Hello to you" said Mikaishe and she bowed. But
Mikaishe kept on staring at ayeka.
"Are you the crown princess of Jurai??" Mikaishe
asked.
"Yes how did you know?" she asked concernly.
"My father used to be a guard at your palace!" she
said.
"really?? That's amazing what was your father's name?"
Ayeka asked.
"Leon Morach" she said.
"Your his daughter??" asked Masaki.
"Yeah." Mikaishee said.
"He used to be my favorite guard. He was a well taught
man." said Ayeka.
"Oh and this is my little sister Sasami." Ayeka said.
"Hi there Sasami" Mikaishe said.
"Hi there!" Sasami smiled.
"psst" said Tenchi and Mikaishe followed Tenchi.
"gotta go. see you all later. Nice meeting you all."
she said.
"Bye" said everyone.
Tenchi took her at Ayeka's garden.
"This is Ayeka's garden. She has worked on it for a
very long time and they're coming out great" Tenchi
explained.
Mikaishe got out of the house and walked in front of
the garden. She stared at the colored roses. She loves
roses, and her eyes glowed with sadness and hapiness.
A little tear came out of her eye. Tenchi walked next
to her and noticed her tear.
"Why are you sad?" asked Tenchi.
"My mom, dad, and little brothers used to have our own
garden when i was little. But they all got killed. I
was the only one that survived the war in Jurai. The
roses were also destroyed by bombs and weapons of
battle. After I was found by the people of earth they
took me as a slave and abused me for the rest of my
life." she said. She closed her eyes and another tear
came out of her eyes. She was heartbroken.
~I shoulsn't have brought her here~ thought Tenchi.
Tenchi took a tissue out of his pocket and tapped her
back. She opened her eyes and stared at him with her
sad green eyes.
"Here have this" said Tenchi giving the tissue in her
hand. She took the clean tissue and cleaned hertearsd
off her eyes.
"Do you wanna go now?" aasked tenchi concernly.
"Yeah sure" she said still sorta sad.
"Im sorry i even took ya here." he apoligized.
"Its ok Tenchi. You didnt know" she said and gave hima
sweet smile. He smiled back. They both walked inside
and saw Mihoshi and Kiyone with their GP uniform.
Mihoshi noticed Tenchi and Mikaishe.
"Oh my goodness you must be Mikaishe!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Mihoshi said happily. Tenchi, Kiyone and Mikaishe had
a sweatdrop.
"Yeah that's me!" she said nervously.
"Im Mihoshi Nice to meet you" she said. KIyone walked
next to Mihoshi.
"and Im Kiyone" she said.
"Nice to meet you both!" mikaishe said.
"Um you guys I gotta finish her tour around the
house." said Tenchi scratching his back.
"Oh ok. Bye BYE!!!!!!!"said Mihoshi happily.
"Ciao" said Kiyone.
"Bye!" said Mikaishe.
Tenchi walked up the hallway. "There's the bathroom"
pointed Tenchi and walked up stairs still with
mikaishee behind him.
They walked up to a room. Ryoko was on their back but
they never noticed her.
~That Mikaishe is taking Tenchi away from me! I will
not let her take my love!~ thought Ryoko.
"And the final place of this tour is my room" said
tenchi. Mikaishe giggled.
"This a pretty cool room" she commented.
"Thanks" he said sorta blushing for a reason.
"Is it ok if I relax on the bed?" Mikaishee asked.
"Oh sure!" he said. Mikaishe laid on the bed and
sighed because it was so comfortable.
"Your bed is very comfy." she commented.
"Thanks again." Tenchi laughed. but she giggled. There
was silence for a few seconds.
"Where am I gonna sleep tenchi?" she asked.
"O god!" he said. " I forgot that!!" he said brushing
his hair with his hand. "Im so sorry!" he apoligized.
"That's ok" she said, "I'll sleep in the floor with a
few blankets." she said and gave another smile.
"Well i goota get prepared for bed." she said.
"Good night Mikaishee" Tenchi said. She faced him.
"Good night Tenchi" she said and left the room.
Mikaishee went downstairs and walked to the kitchen.
She looked for every cabinet to find a glass cup. She
finally found it and took it. She then opedned the
refrigirator and got some water. She walked to the
living and saw all the girls talking continuosly. But
they heard Mikaishe step in the stopped talking and
stared at Mikaishe.
"HI MIKAISHE!!!" said Mihoshi STILL her
pain-in-the-butt personality.
"Hi Mikai" said Washu, "Is it ok if a call you that?"
"It's fine" she said.
"Hey where are the blankets?" Mikai asked.
"Oh I'll get em," said Washu. "you just sit down and
wait. all right?" she said nicely.
"Ok"
Washu stood up from the floor and went past her lab
and went to a closet and got a few blankets. Mikai
layed down on the couch and sighed. Ryoko was looking
at her from upstairs. She teleported from upstairs and
nextr to Mikai.
"Hello Mikaishe" Ryoko said nicely.
"Oh hi there Ryoko I havent seen you lately." Mikai
said.
"Oh its because I was in the Hot springs." Ryoko said.

"You guys have hot springs?" Mikai asked.
"Of course we do!" Ryoko responded nicely. "You wanna
go see them?" she asked.
"Sure!" Mikai said. Ryoko smiled.
~YES!!she's gonna get hot after what Im gonna do to
her! Maybe after this Tenchi will never lay an eye on
her again and love me forever!~ thought Ryoko.
"OK! follow me!" ryoko said cheerfully.
They both entered the hot spring. Ayeka, Sasami and
Ryoki were washing in the hot spring.
"Hi there Mikai!" said Sasami.
"hello Mikaishe" greeted Ayeka.
"Hi to both of you" Mikai said.
"Oh my goodness I forgot I have to go to bed and so
does Sasami!" said Ayeka. She got out of the pool with
a towl wrapped around her. Sasami did the same also.
"Bye!" Sasami said and Ayeka closed the door behind
her.
Mikaishe and Ryoko were standing in front of the
hotsprings and ryoko went walking on the deep side of
the hot springs.
"Well now as you know the hot springs now." ryoko
said.
"i guess so" Mikai said.
"Follow me I'll take you to the lake." said Ryoko.
"Ok." said Mikai.
Both Ryoko and mikai walked out of the hot springs and
went outside. Then a few minutes later, they were both
standing in front of the lake.
"Do you know how to swim??" asked Ryoko.
"No. I don't
~Now its show time!~ thought Ryoko.
"Hey ill take you to the other side!" said Ryoko.
Ryoko with her magic powers, left Mikai floating in
the air. While floating, Ryoko stayed where she was
but Mikai was taken to the middle of the lake. She
stopped floating and fell head first into the water!
SPLASH!!
~YES!!!! this is sweet!!!~ thought Ryoko.
"HEEELLLPP!!" yelled Mikai half way drowning.
"Now to do what I need to do" Ryoko said and
teleported away from the lake.
Mikai was now nowhere to be seen. no breathing, no
nothing...

back at the masaki place....

Tenchi actually couldn't sleep. He was too worried
about his grandpa and scared to see how good was
Mikaishe. Tenchi would be even MORE embarrased to see
that a girl is better than him! He stood up from his
bed and put his gray robe on. He put his red sandals
on and left his room and walked down the stairs.
He got to the living room until someone sqeezed him
very very tight(not so tight really :p)
"TEENNCCHI!!!!!!!!" sqealed Ryoko with hapiness.
Tenchi had the biggest sweatdrop so far.
"Ryoko get off me!!!!!" said tenchi. But Ryoko STILL
hugged him around the chest. Tenchi stopped for a
second.
~Where's Mikaishe????~ he asked himself in thought.
"Hey Ryoko?" siad tenchi.
"Yes????" said ryoko in her ill-do-anything-for-you
type of voice.
"Where's Mikaishe??" he asked worriedly.
~GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! geez!!! he wont
keepher out of his mind!!!!~ thought Ryoko, Her eyes
were in fire and her anger was getting over the top.
She had to lie to him for their own sake!!!
"Well i DID see her around the woods. She said she was
leaving" said Ryoko.
"Oh......." Tenchi said sadly and puts his head down
in shame. Ryoko didn't care about Mikaishe at all! But
she turned around and saw Tenchi, sitting in the
couch, his body just to himself. His hands were on his
face. Ryoko has never seen Tenchi so disappointed.
~Wow. I guess he really needs Mikai. But.... what if
they get together? What If tenchi forgets all about me
and only pays attention to her? Oh gosh. I should tell
him the truth.~ Ryoko thought. She sat down next to
Tenchi, with a look of guiltiness in her eyes. Her
face was as pale as snow and her hair was all down,
unlively and her body was so nervous and shaky that
she couldn't hold a glass of water still.
"Tenchi? I need to tell you something. Mikai isn't in
the woods." she said. Tenchi turned her face to her,
his eyes were glowing with worryness and sadness. His
hands were also shaky but Ryoko was even more shakier
than him.
"Then......where is she?" he asked. Tears  fell down
Ryoko's eyes.
"I threw her into the lake...... now she's in the
bottom of the lake......still and cold....Im so sorry
Tenchi!" Ryoko burst out crying. Her hands on her face
to cover her sadness from her true love. "I know
you'll never forgive me!" she sniffed.
"Why Ryoko?!! WHY?!?!?!" his sadness for some reason
turned into anger.
"Because she would have taken you away from me!!" she
said still with tears in her eyes.
"What?! she's only a tutor Ryoko!! try to understand
that because a girl talks to me doesn't mean you have
to hurt or bruise her... or even KILL her!" said
Tenchi.
"But.......but...."
"no buts Ryoko! you have to learn to be nice to
strangers!" said tenchi.
NOW ryoko was more guilty than ever. His harsh words
were getting into her.
~He's right. I'm not nice. and im not even trying. But
if im nice to the others, then THEY would take Tenchi
away from Tenchi. But its better to be hisw friend
that not even knowing him.~ she thought.
She turned and noticed that tenchi was sitting between
the steps. Ryoko teleports away from everything. She's
now in her little room in the second floor and she
lays in her bed still with tears in her eyes. She fell
asleep in her own slumber.

Meanwhile.......

Tenchi is still thinking of his past. He thinking of a
friend he used to have when he was about 5 or 6. His
friend was a girl. He and her were very good friends.
They did everything together from cleaning his house
to helping with groceries but the thing that amazes
him most is that both of their moms died in the same
day. December 13. He stills remembers. But the other
thing that he doesn't remember is her name. He forgot
it completely.
~I wonder if....~ he thought. ~NAH!!~
Tenchi thought. Tenchi heard a noise that completely
took over silence. Tenchi stood still to see if it
happened again.....but it didn't.
Tenchi wanted to go fishing by himself for a time. No
girls, no pain in the butt. So shile everyone was
asleep, he went ot his closet and got his fishing rod
and his little equipment. He put on his pants and left
the residence.

When he got to the lake....

Tenchi took out his bait and his fishing rod. He threw
a fishing rod. He waited patiently for a snack.

A few minutes later....

He caught one! ~My god! this is a big one!!~ he
thought while pulling. What was strange is that the
fish wasnt moving. tenchi was pulling because it was
so heavy. He rolled her in. it wasn'that heavy no
longer. When it got to land, Tenchi gasped,as if there
was mo more oxygen. His mouth stayed oped and his eyes
wide and his eyes glowing. What he caught
was.......what he caught......it wsa mikaishe. She was
still, her mouth and face all blue, her hands still
and her body not moving an inch. Tenchi let go of his
rod and walked up to her. HE touched her hair to see
hre clearly. Her navy matched the lake's color. Her
skin was as soft as silk. Tenchi had a single tear in
his ear.
"Im so sorry Mikai.... I thought i would be a great
fighter, but.... i think that dream won't come
true..." Tenchi closed his eyes and another tear fell
out of his eye. He washed his tears with his hand.
~Wait.....but what if Washu could rev-~ he thought but
a yell disturbed his thoughts.  He turned to see
Washu.
"Hey ten.....ten.....chh......chi...." said washu
falling to her knees with a gasp. She saw Mikai's dead
body and a tear came down her eye.
Washu came closer to Mikai, Washu stared Tenchi with
sadness. Tenchi's eyes were closed tight and new tears
came down his eyes. But the other thing that Washu
noticed is that he was holding Mikai's hand. His hand
was shaky.
"Tenchi" washu whispered. HE opened his eyes and
stared at her with his glowing handsome eyes.
"Im so sorry this happened but HOW did it happen?"
asked washu.
"ryoko did this... she was jealous of her......she was
pretending that she was showing her around and threw
her in the middle of the lake. BUT worst of
all.....Mikai didn't have a clue how to swim. Then I
brought my fishing rod and got her shirt" he told
Washu. Now more tears came down on Washu's eyes.
"She was a very nice girl.....even though we only knew
her for a few hours it was noticible that she would be
a very special person in the household. And I can't
believe that she loves science!" sai Washu.
"Yeah Youre right. Everything you said I agree with
it." said Tenchi. Washu washed her tears with her
sweater sleeve.
"washu? Can you try and revive Mikai with one of your
machines?" he asked the pink-haired scientist. Washu
put her left hand under her chin and began to think.
She smiled.
"YES!!! I DO!!!" said washu excitedly."its my latest
invention yet!! its a live drive." said Washu.
"how does it work?" he asked.
"Ill tell you when you take mikaishe to the house
hold." said Washu smiling.
Tenchi had a sweatdrop and sighed. He put his arms
gently under Mikai's body and then lifted her up.
~Shes not as heavy as i thought.~ thought Tenchi.

A little of Mikai's hair was on her face, her skin was
still and hard, and her eyes were not showable at all.
Tenchi was for at least 3 or 4 minutes holding Mikai
thorough the woods.

a few minutes later........

Ayeka and Sasami were in the couch. and so were
Mihoshi and Kiyone.None of them couldnt sleep after
noticing that tenchi wasnt sleeping. Then suddenly
Washu opened the door madly(not really but hard)
"Washu?! Where were you?" said ayeka.
"No time to explain. None of you willl believe what
just happened a few hours ago!!" said Washu panting.
Washu moved from the door and Tenchi entered with
Mikai's dead body in his arms. everyone gasped. As if
again there was no oxygen.
"Oh my dear Lord!"  whispered Ayeka to herself.
"Oh god!" whispered Sasami.
"My oh my!" said Mihoshi and Kiyone.
"w-w-w-what happened?" said Sasami. tenchi told
everyone to move off the couch. He placed Mikai's body
gently on the couch.
"Ill explain....." said tenchi. Tenchi sighed. and
closed his eyes.
"Ryoko did this....She was jealous of Mikai and me
being together.....I was just touring her around!
She's never been to the earth before! Then she told me
about herself and...... everything she saw here,
ayeka's garden, my room, the kitchen, everything,
reminded her of her family's death.....and I thought i
should ne easy on her...... and then....Ryoko threw
down in the middle of the lake and left her there..."
said tenchi. Everyone was in tears. Even Ryoki(cute!)
and again washu cried.
"And the worst part of all is..... she didn't know how
to swim!" said Tenchi.
"Oh dear lord!! THAT RYOKO!!!!!! THAT GOOD FOR NOTHING
SPACE B**CH!!!!" said ayeka. Everyone stared at ayeka
with a sweatdrop. (even ryoki).
"but the good thing is that we're gonna try and revive
her!" washu said.
"YAYYY!!!!!!" everyone said.
"Meoww!!!!!!" said Ryoki smiling.
"BUT I'm not truely positive that it will work." said
Washu.
"AWWWWW!!!!!" everyone said.
"WAH!!!!!!!!" said Ryoki crying, and Sasami calmed her
down.
"Tenchi, bring her to my lab" said. Tenchi did as she
told him. He held her in his arms(again!) and walked
to his lab. and everyone was sitting in the couch
waiting for that shiny moment.....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Is Washu's machine going to revive Mikai? Will Tenchi
ever forgive Ryoko for what she did?
Next on Lost goddess: Part 2; the moment of a
lifetime.
