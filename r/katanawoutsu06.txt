	"The riddle of steel," murmured Conan, remembering the words of his father, the Cimmerian 
smith.
	"Yes, you know that riddle, do you not?"  The cult leader's voice was intimate, persuasive.  
Speaking as to a friend, Doom's words continued emotionless, hypnotic, brimming with deceit.  "In 
those days, I deemed steel stronger than all things, even than human flesh and spirit.  But I was 
wrong, boy!  I was wrong!  The soul of man or woman can master everything, even steel!  Look you, 
boy --"
	Raising his hypnotic eyes, he fixed them upon the sweet face of the smiling girl above them 
on the wall.
	"Come to me, child," he hissed, his sibilant voice scarcely above a whisper.
	The childish face became suffused with joy.  She poised for a moment at the edge of the 
embankment; then, without a glance at the youth beside her, she leaped from the wall and fell with a 
heavy thud on the tiles of the garden walk below.
	Conan averted his eyes from the doll-like broken body near their feet.  Doom laughed, the 
music of his laughter spun through with a note of triumph.  Then he said: "That is strength, boy -- 
that is power!  It is strength against which the hardness of steel or the resilience of human flesh 
are as naught.  What is steel, compared to the hand that wields it; what is the hand, without a mind 
to command it?  There is the secret of strength.  Steel, bah!"

	Washu sat in her rocking chair, singing a lullaby to Achika.  The chair was placed on the 
veranda, overlooking the gardens immediately surrounding the Imperial Palace.  The acreage was 
enclosed in a dense screen of trees, which swayed ever-so-gently in the afternoon breeze.  Above the 
field the clouds marched majestically, casting ponderous shadows onto the rolling countryside.  
Birds chased one another, leaves whispered, and the chair squeaked rhythmically.  
	On the lawn below, Washu's family gathered around the circular stone table.  It had started 
when Tenchi wandered outside, looking for a quiet place to study in the irresistible afternoon 
sunlight.  Shortly afterwards, Ayeka, Sasami, and the convalescing Misaki had ventured outside, lost 
in a conversation about  babies and nurseries.  They had joined him at his invitation.  Then Funaho 
had lead Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Kiyone outside, carrying pocket-terminals and reference books and 
charts, and had commandeered another slice of the table to plan their first assignment together.  
Their voices were subdued, and provided yet another murmur to harmonize with Washu's lullaby.
	There had been activity, of course.  Sasami went into the kitchen frequently to check
 on dinner, once bringing a plate of cookies to pass around the table.  Funaho sent Mihoshi inside 
after a reference manual, and Mihoshi had stopped on the way back to nuzzle Tenchi's neck.  Since 
her hair was now unbound it cascaded around her shoulders in golden waves, and he had grabbed a 
handful and tugged gently until her lips were in reach of his own.  Ayeka and Ryoko promptly 
demanded -- and received -- equal attention, accompanied by much giggling and laughing.  And they 
all waved frequently at Washu and the sleeping infant.
	Washu was at peace with the universe.
	"Such an idyllic scene," said the deep, feminine voice.  Tsunami shimmered into visibility 
beside the rocking chair.
	"It sure is," Washu replied.
	"It is unfortunate that such peaceful moments do not last."
	"All the more reason to treasure them," Washu replied, kissing her daughter's forehead 
lightly.
	"What do your forecasts and projections reveal?"
	"The same thing that your visions and prognostications do: Tenchi's Power will dwarf us all 
eventually."
	"You must realize that he is an aberration.  A mutation, born a thousand generations too 
soon."
	Washu shrugged.  "That depends upon your point-of-view.  I prefer to think of him as the 
first-of-his-kind, rather than one-of-a-kind."
	Tsunami gestured towards the sleeping Achika.  "You have good reason to take that position."
	"Do you regret saving Tenchi's life?"
	"No, of course not.  Even if I had lacked feelings for the boy, Sasami would never have 
forgiven me."
	Washu nodded.  "You didn't have to unlock his Power Attributes, you know."
	"He never could have defeated Kagato without them.  He would have surely died.  And if by 
some miracle he had survived the encounter, then his Power would have found another outlet.  Such 
potentials must be fulfilled, one way or another.  This way, we have some influence.  Does that 
bother you, Sister?"
	"Nope.  Not one bit."  Washu turned to look at the shimmering figure beside her.  "Let's 
face facts, Sister.  Each of us assumed a different form, placing ourselves and our energies into a 
species native to this dimension capable of handling our Power.  The experiment was less than 
successful: we were unable to produce offspring that matched our capabilities.  So we chose avatars, 
my Ryoko and your Sasami, and in that our successes were still less than anticipated.  It is Tenchi 
who has risen to the task, and I thank the gods that he appeared when he did."
	"Ryoko will recover her gems within two years, and Sasami will pass through puberty shortly 
afterwards.  Doesn't this concern you?"
	"Not as much as it did."
	"Why?  What has changed?"
	"Because the breadth of Tenchi's Power is only matched by the depth of his character.  He 
strengthens all those around him.  Ryoko and Sasami are being redeemed.  I have greater hope for our 
future."
	"But it will take time, Sister.  Tokimi may not grant us enough time."
	Washu sighed.  "Then we will do the best with what we have.  But what we have is 
formidable."

A U T H O R ' S   N O T E S :

The following thoughts are posted as a mini-FAQ, in an effort to provide answers for those readers 
who are scratching their heads over some of the positions and opinions stated in the above story.



KAGATO AND WASHU:

I have seen suggestions in other fanfics that Washu and Kagato may have been lovers in the Old Days. 
I personally doubt it, based on one observation and one supposition.  

The observation: she was dumped into a stasis chamber on the Souja while in her adolescent form, and 
I have to assume that during her last stressful moments, she would not have been wasting time/energy 
switching shapes trying to convince him to change his mind.  I expect that this was the form she had 
settled upon long before accepting him as a graduate student.

The supposition: They had too much in common to 'click'.  She had a higher morality base, he had 
fewer scruples, but they both shared too many personality traits.  It's the opposites that attract, 
after all.

KAGATO AND RYOKO:

I think there's a pretty good case for naming Kagato as Ryoko's "father."  His hair is more of a 
silverish color than her cyan, and his eyes are totally golden as opposed to her pupils.  But I'm 
guessing these were changes from the base characteristics brought on by aging and then loss of his 
corporeal constitution.  In other words, he was no longer completely human, but he looked a bit 
different when he was completely human.  And what sealed the deal for me was comparing their Power 
Attributes.  The following information is based upon the details and graphics at "Kagato's Special 
Abilities"  (http://www.cage.curtin.edu.au/~budworth/special.html) and  "Ryoko's Powers"  
(http://jurai.syste.ms/ryoko/ryo_powr.html):

   * Teleportation - Both individuals make use of this talent, although we see Ryoko using it more 
     frequently.
   * Flight and Levitation - Both of them seem to prefer floating to walking (heck, so would I!).
   * Shield - His is quite powerful, her's seems less effective.
   * Energy Sword - Different shapes, different colors, similar functionality.
   * Energy Blasts - Projectile variations on the Sword, tailored to each person.
   * Shadows/Doppelgangers - They each demonstrated the ability only once, so it must be 
     energy-intensive.
   * Matter Conversion - Limited application, also probably energy-intensive.  Useful in combat.
   * Non-corporeal Form - i.e., "phasing" through walls, floors, etc.
   * Mind Link - Between Kagato and Ryoko, between Kagato and the Souja, between Ryoko and Ryo-ohki 
     (and Washu, of course).
   * Regeneration - Ryoko keeps growing new hands, Kagato healed Tenchi's cut on his cheek (but the 
     damage from the Lighthawk Sword must have been too extensive).
   * Drawing Power through gems - Ryoko has her three red ones, Kagato has an undetermined number of 
     (I'm guessing here) green gems.

Of course, each of them has unique Power Attributes as well:

Kagato:
   * Spirit Fire - Kagato uses this rather than a flashlight.  A fire elemental, perhaps?
   * Gateway - Actually, this is the "transport sphere" I used in the story above.
   * Telekinesis - Making a grab for the Tenchi-ken, summoning a cyclone to employ against Tenchi, 
     etc.
   * Mind Touch - This is NOT telepathy.  It's actually closer to what I had Tenchi using in "And If 
     I Fall".

Ryoko:
   * Demon Summoning - Calling elementals.  Possibly similar to Kagato's Spirit Fire.
   * Astral travel - Limited in scope and duration.


O T H E R   P O W E R   U S E R S:

The following definitions were stolen shamelessly from "GURPS Psionics, Fantastic Powers of Mind 
Over Matter" by David L. Pulver, available at http://www.sjgames.com (search the Catalog for 
"GURPS", and then stroll down the resulting list until you find "Psionics"):

Tenchi:
   * Autoteleport: This is the basic Teleport ability -- the skill to move yourself from 
     point-to-point without crossing the space between.  You cannot go somewhere unless you have 
     already been there, or can see it at the moment you are teleporting.
   * Exoteleport: This is the ability to transport objects from point-to-point, allowing you to 
     teleport objects without teleporting yourself.

Mihoshi:
   * Electrokinesis: This is the ability to mentally control computers and electrical and electronic 
     systems.  An electrokinetic must be able to see or touch the subject to affect it.

     (i) Dampen: You can hinder the function of all electrical devices in the area by "slowing" the 
                 current that powers the object.
     (ii) Surge: This skill causes a power surge in an electrical device.  You cannot "surge" an 
                 entire spacecraft or vehicle; you must target the specific electrical system.
   * Limitations: Limitations reduce the utility of psi powers.
     (i) Nuisance Effect: Your ability has an annoying side effect of some sort -- something that 
                 actually causes harm to you or those around you, or causes you a serious 
                 inconvenience.
     (ii) Unconscious Only: This can be taken only in conjunction with the Uncontrollable 
                 limitation.  The psi skill cannot be consciously activated at all; it can only come 
                 into play under stress.
     (iii) Uncontrollable: This limitation is only available for the Antipsi, Electrokinetic, 
                 Psychokinetic, and Teleport powers.  Your power tends to manifest by itself -- even 
                 against your will -- when you are angry or excited.  This can be especially 
                 interesting if your skill is destructive and you have a high power.


INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORTATION

I can just see the e-mail coming from those screaming about the travel times required to get around 
in the TM universe.  Well, I got news for you: outer space is *vast*.  There is slick little 
calculator at http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/solar_system/index.html that will compute a model 
illustrating the scale distances involved in our own solar system.  The premise is to place markings 
at appropriate distances on a roll of paper (toilet paper, printer paper, etc) to represent the nine 
planets.  You will be amazed at the volume of empty space.  For my own calculations (and remembering 
that this is just fiction, after all) I placed the psuedospace jump-point at approximately 4.3 AU 
(Astronomical Units, or 645,000,000 km, or 399,900,000 mi) from the average star.  Which puts the 
corresponding distance between Earth/Jurai and the jump-point at roughly 3.3 AU (495,000,000 km, or 
306,900,000 mi).  And even allowing for Sir Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law ("Any sufficiently advanced 
technology is indistinguishable from magic") to permit Juraian technology to generate tremendous 
speed, it is *still* going to take a while to get anywhere.

For instance, it takes eight minutes for light to cover the distance between the sun and the Earth 
(1 AU, or 150,000,000 km, or 93,000,000 mi).  A little work on a calculator shows that to cover the 
3.3 AU from Earth to the jump-point will take 26 minutes.  Not bad, just not realistic.  However, if 
Juraian technomagic can boost a ship up to even 20% of lightspeed, then you could get to the 
jump-point in 550 minutes, or just over nine hours.  Of course, at this speed the relativistic 
effects would become noticeable -- but I kept such considerations to a minimum.

If Tenchi is zipping around at 70% lightspeed, then you can see a drastic reduction in travel time.  
The longest distance being from Earth to Pluto, or 39 AU, would take him just under eight hours.  

And psuedospace is just guesswork and wishful thinking at this point.


SOLAR MECHANICS AND THE SUNBUSTER BOMB

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are clouds of hot (1-2 million degrees) gasses ejected from the Sun at 
extremely high speeds.  After acceleration away from the Sun, they will travel through 
interplanetary space and reach Earth in 2.5 to 5 days. Once here, CMEs cause disturbances in the 
magnetosphere, which trigger auroras, make magnetic navigation at high latitudes difficult, and 
sometimes cause current spikes in high-voltage power lines, resulting in power outages and 
occasionally in destruction of power equipment.  They also can damage or destroy Earth-orbiting 
satellites.

Physicists theorize that fluctuations in the sun's magnetic field cause sunspots, flares and CMEs.  
CMEs can be massive objects; spanning 120° in solar latitude or longitude, they can involve 10^16 g 
(i.e. billions of tons) of gas that is suddenly ejected at speeds up to 2000 km/s with a kinetic 
energy >10^32 ergs, all directed outward into interplanetary space.   The ongoing changes are not 
confined to the space immediately around the star.  The sun's magnetic field envelops the entire 
solar system in a bubble that scientists call the 'heliosphere,' which extends 50 to 100 AU beyond 
the orbit of Pluto. Inside it is the solar system -- outside is interstellar space.  Changes in the 
Sun's magnetic field are carried outward through the heliosphere by the solar wind.  It takes about 
a year for disturbances to propagate all the way from the Sun to the outer bounds of the 
heliosphere.

Empress Funaho was right to be concerned about Washu's sunbuster bomb being employed in an inhabited 
solar system.  One of the most spectacular Y2K disaster scenarios was that a massive CME might 
strike the Earth, only instead of killing satellites and power grids, it would directly kill people 
by sudden heating of the environment.  Ramping-up the temperatures of the atmosphere and the ocean 
surface would generate extreme weather conditions across the entire globe.  Think: El Nino On 
Steroids.  Setting off such a devastating weapon ranks a notch or two above genocide, since you'd be 
inflicting ecological damage on a massive scale.  Sooner or later, someone/something is going to 
hold you accountable....


MISCELLANEOUS:

I wasn't the first person to apply Matthew Sweet's "Walk Out" or 3 Doors Down's "Kryptonite" to TM.  
You will find anime music videos by BuggyNess ("Tenchi's Walk Out") and Slayerwolf ("Super Tenchi")  
-- both have stories posted on the TMFFA -- at http://www.animemusicvideos.org/ that are quite well 
done, and inspired me to use them here.  In fact, these are the audiovisual equivalents to the 
fanfics found on TMFFA.  I highly recommend perusing their archives (I have several favorites I've 
downloaded and committed to CD).

There's an awful lot of information in the story above.  Some of it is pure conjecture on my part, 
trying to stay consistent with the OVA and the other three stories in this series ("Kime", "We 
Belong", "And If I Fall").  However, many of the background details were gleaned from the "Tenchi 
Muyo In Depth Alternate Universes" website (http://dimensional.com/~josh/TMID_FAQ/).  Honestly, I 
wish I'd read this FAQ before I ever started writing TM fanfics.  I might have done a better job of 
keeping the facts straight...then again, I might never have taken the wild tangent I did, either.  
Go figure.

I got quite a bit of e-mail after about the first three stories (Thank You, by the way), and the 
most commonly asked question was: "Where's Kiyone?"  So, just for you folks, I included her in this 
story.  However, I admit to having mixed feelings about it.  First off, she was never really in the 
OVA (just the "Mihoshi Special"), and though she is one of the most popular characters from the 
Negishi (TV shows), she really doesn't belong in the OVA continuity.  Second off, she disrupts the 
continuity for Mihoshi.  To quote from the above-named FAQ:  "Many fans like Kiyone but point out 
that Kiyone's character destroys Mihoshi's character and the foil relationship between Washu and 
Mihoshi."  I agree, and feel that Mihoshi has been terribly 'dumbed-down' to make her a 
poorly-portrayed comic relief.  I much prefer to see her as a blonde Columbo -- kinda rambling and 
ditzy, but extremely competent.  If I write any more fanfics in this series, I would portray the 
Kiyone-Ryoko-Mihoshi team of Special Investigators as a cross between The Marx Brothers 
(Groucho-Chico-Harpo), who were accomplished musicians and performers, and Charlie's Angels 
("Tenchi's Angels," anyone?), who are proficient detectives and martial artists.  Stupid or 
bubbleheaded charicatures will NOT appear.

If you are at all interested in how fleet actions could be fought in interplanetary or interstellar 
space, I highly recommend reading the "The Lensman" series by E.E. 'Doc' Smith.  These are classic 
space opera novels written on an epic scale.  There are several fleet battles, described in 
sufficient detail to satisfy even the staunchest 'hard science' sci-fi fan (like me).  For a 
complete list of the series, check out the website at http://www.wheels.org/lens/.

The title of this story is from the Japanese verb 'katanawoutsu': to temper or forge a sword.

The characters of Tenchi Muyo were created by Hiroki Hayashi, and brought to North America by 
Pioneer LDC.  This story, while incorporating names and situations held under copyright by others, 
is copyright 2002 by Jeffery L. Harris. 

This story comes entirely from my imagination, and is not, nor intended to be, canon.  Please do not 
send the legions of lawyers after me...it's not worth their time, or mine.
