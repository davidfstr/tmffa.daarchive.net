Disclaimer: look I don't own Tenchi. Just Pioneer. But I do own the 
ideas, Miko, and some other stuff that comes up in this chapter. I wont 
say what it is so let the story begin.

Dragon love for you and me

   Part3: All Quiet in my Eye's


Dinner had gone by perfectly Ryoko. Azusa actually commented 
Ryoko on her cooking. Sasami was overwhelmed that Funaho loved the 
dessert. Yosho ate most of them before it was dinnertime. Now though it 
was time for bed, and Ryoko sat calmly brushing her spiky cyan hair. 
She usually held it in curls or in a bun but she left it to the normal 
style of her people. Yosho walked in the room with Miko in his arms. 
Ryoko set down the brush and turned to her husband. Miko giggled 
as she grabbed Yosho's finger. "Ayeka is coming back in two months." He 
said passing the baby to Ryoko. "Faith should be letting her stay there 
since I shan't return home." She began to brush Miko's hair as Yosho 
sat on the bed. "Maybe you should go back to being a priestess. When 
Ayeka returns she wont want to see much of you here." Yosho added. 
The door to the bedroom opened. "Shall I take Miko to her 
chambers Lady Ryoko." The women asked politely. Ryoko nodded and handed 
her the baby. She kissed her on the forehead before Miko left. "I don't 
see why we can't leave Juari. I just want a life where I can put my 
child to bed. And not be guarded everywhere I go. I had this life this 
life before on Faith. Yosho I don't want it now." Ryoko cried. Yosho 
looked at her with his fragile maroon eyes. He pulled her close with 
his hand. And whispered in her ear, "all is calm for now. One quiet 
moment shall lead use to a new home." 
The priestess relaxed and the lights dampened. She lay her head 
soft on the pillow and wrapped her arms around him smiling. His long 
hair bounded in a band. She softly was covered with the warmth and 
softness of sleep. Yosho turned to look at his wife. Her steady 
breathing drifting him into a wonderful slumber overwhelmed his 
peaceful heart. He pulled the covers to their necks and slept the night 
away.

At the Tenchi residence hours had passed since Washu's outburst 
of the missing couple. Ayeka tried her best to feel happy that Ryoko 
was gone but her heart wouldn't let her. Kiyoni had to explain things 
to Mihoshi since we all know she is slow in the head. Sasami, Washu, 
and Tenchi though are a different story. Tenchi had locked himself in 
his room and Sasami just stood by the stove, starring into oblivion. 
Washu locked herself in the lab looking for a way to get to that time 
and get the two back.
'Why did it have to be her?', he asked himself continually. He 
lay on his bed thinking to himself. He practically hated himself for 
not saying anything sooner. Ryoko left him for his grandfather. 'Why?' 
he asked himself again. It couldn't go this way. He had to have Ryoko. 
Maybe she left because he wouldn't return the love she felt for him. 
Tenchi sat up from his bed. He looked at the door then down at 
his hands. "What ever it takes I'll get Ryoko back and tell her how I 
feel." With that said he got up and walked out of his room. The stares 
that he got from the others seemed to ask for a miracle. He walked past 
them with no words spoken and into Washu's lab. Washu seemed to be out 
in different section of the lab but, he felt that he needed to see her.

Ryoko awoke with the feeling of the sun grazing her face. Yosho 
was up and gone for what she say of his side of the bed. Ryoko lay back 
down on the pillow. 'what was that dream about. What happens when six 
people come from nowhere and change my home? My life. I should ask 
priest Lancer.' She then got up from her rest and changed as she planed 
the day.
She walked out her chambers and called for Azaka and Kamidake. As 
they lead her to the Church of Juari she looked at all the scenery. 
Juari was a beautiful place. Almost looked like Faith. Ryoko herself 
studied the galaxy and she knew the only plant prettier than here was 
Earth. A place that she wanted to go to but Kagato wouldn't have his 
daughter going anywhere near that place. She one day wanted to go Earth 
and live a life there. She wanted it to be with Yosho and Miko, just 
the three of them.
The priestess say that they had arrived at the church and not 
wanting to be noticed by others she rushed in. The candles illuminated 
the room. She passed the many benches of people that have committed 
sins and such. Lancer a short brown haired juarian  turned to see the 
person he had longed to see.
"Oh Ryoko my Lady its been so long. My child what would bring you 
here on a good afternoon?" He asked really concerned. "Well Priest 
Lancer, I have had a dream and I think it may be a premonition of some 
sort." She explained to him. "My child please continue." He added 
wanting to hear this story.

Tenchi found Washu in the darkest corners of the Lab.(didn't know 
she had an ending to the lab~_~) She turned to see who it was. "Hello 
Miss Washu, is there anything I can do to help find them." He asked 
hopingly. Washu nodded. "Yah gather the others we are leaving for the 
past in five minutes." She said cutely. Tenchi didn't want to argue and 
he couldn't believe they were leaving at such short notice. He obliged 
anyway to the order and went to gather the others.

"So you see I think this might lead to something." Ryoko 
finished. Lancer took note of everything she told him. "Just let it be 
for now  my child. Things change. Besides if anything happens the God 
Naf will be there. Since you and him have become one then he will not 
let your happiness die unless it is for the love of another." Lancer 
said fully aware that Ryoko would never leave Yosho for someone else. 
Ryoko smiled and said that she ought to be getting back to Miko. 
As Ryoko walked outside of the church light came from nowhere and 
an explosion occurred right out of nowhere. Azaka covered Ryoko as 
Kamidake made a shield. From the priestess being scared like that, she 
fell onto the ground. Everything settled down and Kamidake helped Ryoko 
to her feet. "Are you okay my Lady?" he asked as she dusted herself 
off. She nodded in response and started walking toward the dusted 
field.
As she got closer she saw some figures of people. 'could they 
have been the cause of this mess?' she thought to herself. As the dust 
cleared six people could be seen, all of them seeming to have fainted. 
Ryoko ran toward the group and looked at them. They were a mess. She 
called over the guards to collect the group and take them to the 
church.

"Thank you so much for taking them in Lancer." Ryoko thanked him. 
He had a few extra rooms and he let them stay there for a rest. She 
bowed down and lifted her head. "Do you have a schedlater.(I made that 
up but hey it sounded good didn't it.)I think I should tell Yosho that 
I'm here." She asked. Lancer nodded his head as he gave her the device. 
She took it and walked in the first room. It held a man, and two little 
girls. She sat down in a chair by the window. She got a hold of Yosho 
before she knew it. "honey I'm going to be a little late coming home. 
Could you help Sasami make the dinner since I wont be able to make it?" 
she asked. Yosho sighed. "Sure. Where are you anyway." He asked.
"Oh at the church. Something happened and I want to make sure 
that these people are alright. I'll tell you when I get home." She said 
before waving goodbye and hanging up. A groan could be heard from the 
man and Ryoko hurried over to him. She took a damp cloth from the 
nightstand and cleaned off the access dirt. His eyes opened to see 
golden eyes. They softened as she sighed. He looked at her face to see 
Ryoko.
