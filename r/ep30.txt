his desk writing in his notes. Kiyone is seated across from him.
KIYONE: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Oe? (Kintaro is drawing
in his notes) Mr. Oe? (he's still in his notes) HEY!!
KINTARO: Oh PLEEEASE FORGIVE ME, MY LADY!
KIYONE: What are you talking about? 
KINTARO: Oh, sorry. Anyway, as you know Mr. Fujikoma died last week
and he left you somthing in his will.
KIYONE: What is it? An heirloom? Money? I don't know what he would've
left me or why I am even in the will. He didn't have any family that
know of.
KINTARO: Let's see. AH HA! Here it is! HE HAS SEEN FIT TO LEAVE

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 30: NO NEED FOR HEIRS!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The Galaxy Police Sub-station orbitng Titan (one of Saturn's
moons) A tawny colored cabbit is sitting down watching his Pioneer
hand-held mini-widescreen TV with sub-space PrimeStar dish and Pioneer
Micro LDC Recorder and eating a bag of something called Shnookies!
DEMI:(offscreen)TETIN! GET YOUR FURRY HIDE OUT HERE!(Tetin, the
cabbit, jumps into the bag of Shnookies but his rear end is sticking
out. Demi enters) There you are!(Pulls him out)
TETIN: NAYOOOO!
DEMI: Knock it off with the cabbit talk! I didn't spend five years
teaching you to talk just to hear that!
TETIN: But Tetin miss Tetin's favorite show!
DEMI: You can record it!
TETIN: Must finish Shnookies!
DEMI: We'll take'em with us!(She takes him to the airlock) Now quit
crying and get out there!(She puts the air containment field up and
throws Tetin into space where he does his transformation into a cabbit
ship)Now where is Megumi? MEGUMI! (Megumi runs in)
MEGUMI: I'm sorry ma'am. I didn't mean to be late.
DEMI: No need for appologies! Just get onboard.(They both board Tetin) 
MEGUMI: By the way, ma'am, where are we going?
DEMI: A shining planet known as Earth.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Tenchi's room. Tenchi is helping Seion unpack his weapons
TENCHI: You do know it's against the law here to possess any weapons
without a permit.
SEION: Yeah, well when you turn me in you should get Tenchi-ken
registered.(teardrop forms at the backe of Tenchi's head)
TENCHI: Point taken.(Tenchi picks up one of Seion's daggers and
un-sheaths it. The dagger has a blue crystal blade.) Woah! This is
beautiful. Where did you get this?
SEION: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! GIMME THA-(startled, Tenchi accidently
swings the dagger and cuts Seion under his right eye.)
TENCHI: Uh-oh. I so sorry about that Seion. I didn't mean to-
SEION: Don't worry about it.
TENCHI: But-
SEION: The cut? I'm actually glad you did that.
TENCHI: Huh?
SEION: A Torabushi's dagger, once awakened, cannot be put to sleep
again until it has tasted blood. If you wish to look at it, though,
take this.(he hands him a piece of blood-soaked cloth) Just touch the
tip of the blade to the cloth. 
TENCHI: You mean you cut yourself open every time you show some body
these thing?
SEION: I didn't say it had to be fresh blood. The blood cloth I have
is over 500 years old. It has been passed down along with this (he
opens up a dagger case, pulls out a piece of white silk with a heart
shapped blood spot on it and unsheaths a exquised emerald-bladed
dagger.) The Amatora (Tiger of Heaven). Out of all the Torabushi's
weapons this is the most important to him. It represents his honor.
Without honor everything else is pointless. Isn't that right, Yosho?
YOSHO: Well put, Torabushi.(We see Yosho standing at the door)
TENCHI: How long have you been standing there, grampa?
YOSHO: Since Seion told you you should register Tenchi-ken. I came up
to tell you two of you friends are here.
TENCHI: What friends?
SCENE: The living room. Sasami is playing "Pocket Fighter" against
Asaka with Kamadaki looking on. Tenchi, Seion and Yosho enter.
ASAKA: I'VE GOT YOU THIS TIME, PRINCESS! HA-HAAA!
SASAMI: AAAAHHHHH! Come on, Sakura! Don't lose to Ryu! Oh no!
ASAKA: YES! I'VE DONE IT! I'VE DEFETED THE MASTER!
SEION: (sarcasim intended) So the big, bad Jurian Kaaaa-nigit has
defeted a cute and cuddly princess! What a hero!
KAMADAKI: I don't have to stand for that, Tore-a-butt-chee-
ASAKA: Watch you language. my friend. It seems our Torabushi friend
here needs a course in humility.
SEION: Pocket Fighter?
ASAKA: Poket Fighter.
(10 minutes later)
SEION: Isn't Ibuki so cute when she wins?
ASAKA: Grrrrrrr! BEST OF NINE!
SEION: Oh, Yeah? Fine! I'll kick you with Dan!
KAMADAKI: When you mentioned that lesson in humlity, did you let him
know that he was supposed to be getting it, not giving it.
ASAKA: This isn't fair! He's a cyborg.
SEION: And you're a-
TENCHI: That's enough! Now shake hands and try to get along!
ASAKA: Sorry about my lack of grace, Seion.
SEION: I'm sorry about that Ka-nigit crack. Friends?
ASAKA: Friends.
TENCHI: Now how come I can't get Aeka and Ryoko to do that?
SEION: Easy! We weren't fighting over food, women or money. Just
Bragging rights!
SASAMI: LUNCH IS READY! NICE COLD SANDWICHES AND ICE TEA!
ASAKA: OUT OF MY WAY!
SEION: HEY, I'M GETTING THERE FIRST!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: At Kiyone's new flower shop a little later that day. The girls
are having a look around.
AEKA: I must say, Kiyone, this place could use a little sprucing up.
RYOKO: That's not the only thing that needs to be spruced up, Aeka!
AEKA: And just what is that supposed to mean?
NAGI: WILL YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF?!
SASAMI: Yeah, someone could get hurt!
MIHOSHI: And if Kiyone and I were to get hurt the consiquecnes would
be most unpleasent.
RYOKO: Gah?
NAGI: She's means it'a piss Seion off!
RYOKO: Bah.(to Aeka) I don't know if Mihoshi was more annoying before
or since that run-in with the Evo booth that Washu-
WASHU: AHEM!
RYOKO: Grrrrr! That LITTLE Washu made.
SASAMI: Hey, Kiyone! Can I see the Koi pond?
KIYONE: Sure you can. Follow me! Nagi, can you keep those two out of
trouble?
NAGI: I guess if I have to babysit them, I will.
KIYONE: Thanks! (Sasami and Kiyone leave the room)
RYO-OKI: MIYA!
RYOKO: What? Can't you talk yet?
RYO-OKI: Ryo-oki...trying but...it hard to talk.
WASHU: Lighten up on her Ryoko! She's only been a humaniond for a
week. How long was it before you could talk?
RYOKO: Uhhh..I don't remember!
NAGI: Try two and a half years. But she was able to pick pockets after
only six months.
RYOKO: WHAT?! (everybody stars laughing)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Greenhouse. Sasami is at the koi pond feeding the fish.
Kiyone is watching. We hear Aeka's laughter in the backround.
SASAMI:(giggling) Wow! What pretty fish! I'll name you Ryoga, and
you'll be Ranma. Oh, and I'll name the big black and white one Genma.
And I'll call you Kasumi.
KIYONE: Come on Sasami! Let name one!(as she looks into the water, she
notices that Sasami's reflection is that of a much older girl with
blue hair and pink eyes. But let's just say Tsunami) Sasami?! (scene
continues after the commercial break)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: Nerima. Nighttime. Ukyo is on the phone. She's dressed for bed,
BTW
UKYO: Hello, Police. There's a perverted little man trying to steal my
underwear! You'll send someone right over? Arigato!
HAPPOSAI:(running out of the house) WHAT A HAUL! WHAT A-(a bright
spotlight shines in his face and stops him dead in his tracks. Then we
see the source of the light-The Yakami)
KIYONE:(over a loud speaker) This is the Galaxy Police. Don't move.
It's not like you've got a choice since your caught in our stasis
field!
ANNONCER(RANMA): If you gonna call the Police, call the Police. But if
you're hungry for Okinomiyaki made just the way you like it, go to
Ukyo's. Ukyo's. Have it you're way!
UKYO: Oh, Ranma-Honey!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KINTARO: Hello! My name is Kintaro Oe. I'm 25 years old and i'm an
attorney at law. Currently I have an office next to Nariko's Ramen
shop. If you ever need legal representation call me at GLDNBOY and
I'll do my best to study your case and get you the settlement you
deserve. The GoldenBoy Law Firm. Life is study. And so is the law.
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's
back)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SASAMI: And that's why my reflection was different. You're the first
person besides me and Miss Washu that has ever seen this. Promise you
won't tell anyone, Okay?
KIYONE: You have my word as a Daughter of the Crystal Shrine that I
won't tell.
SASAMI: What's the Crystal Shrine?
KIYONE: It's a sisterhood on my planet. Something like the Girls
Scouts here on Earth.
AEKA:(in the distance) Sasami! We're leaving!
SASAMI:I'M COMING! So when will you be opening up?
KIYONE: Tommorow night. Tell everybody that they're invited.
SASAMI: I will! Buh-bye!(Sasami runs out)
DEMI:(from off screen)Does that invite include me?(Kiyone turns around
to see Demi, Tetin, and Megumi)
KIYONE: Demi! What are you doing here? You know you're not supposed to
be here. What if one of the Earthlings see you?
DEMI: Don't worry! You're closed, remember? I came to introduce you to
someone. Kiyone meet-
TETIN: Tetin! Tetin greatest cabbit in the universe!
DEMI: Shut up and eat your Shnookies. Meet Officer Megumi. She's been
posted to our sub-station.
KIYONE:(to Demi) Why is she dressed in that style of uniform that I
used to wear?
DEMI: Call it a bit of hero worship!
MEGUMI: It's an honor to meet you ma'am. I look forward to working
with you.
KIYONE: Heh heh. Great.(to Demi again) At least she doesn't take after
Mitsuki!(they both shutter at the thought)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Up at the shrine. Tenchi and Seion are practicing with Yosho,
Asaka, Kamadaki, Ken-oki(in humaniod form) and Noboyuki looking on.
They are in the middle of a conentration exercise.
SEION: Now I want you to stretch out your arms and recite that passage
that I had you memorize. Meanwhile I'll be walking around you striking
you with the staff. The Idea is to ignore ALL distaction, not to
desensitize you. Ready. Begin.
TENCHI: When you put water into a glass(WHACK!) ARRGG!...it becomes
the glass. When put water into a bowl(CRACK!)AAAHHH!....it becomes the
bowl. When you put water into a bottle(THWACK!)OOOUCCHHHH!!..oh
god...it..becomes th-the bottle. Be like water my
friend(KEERACK)AHHHHHH!...(Cough!)...be...like..wa....ter.(falls to
his knees 
SEION: Not bad for a beginner.
KAMADAKI: Can you do it?!
SEION: That sounds like a challenge. I'll let you do the whacking,
Kamadaki.
KAMADAKI: Just try to ignore this. Ready. Begin.
SEION: When(CRACK!)you put(THWACK!)water into a glass(WHACK!) it
becomes the glass.(CRACK!)When you put water into a
bowl(WHACK!WHACK!)it becomes the(KERACK!)bowl. When you put water into
a
bottle(CRACK!)it(WHACK!)becomes(THWACK!)the(KERACK!)bottle(WHACK!CRACK
!THWACK).(to Kamadaki) Be like water my friend. Be like water.
KAMADAKI: Grrrrr..I loose face every time I time I doubt a Torabushi's
abilities.
SEION: Jurian Knights' fighting skills or no match for a Torabushi's
skills and a Torabushi's powers are no match for a Jurian Knight's
powers. By the time we're through training Tenchi he's gonna be one
bad mother-
SASAMI:(in the backround) Hey everybody!(Sasami runs into the scene
with Ryoko, Aeka, Ryo-oki and Mihoshi in tow) Kiyone invited us to the
opening of her...Tenchi! What's wrong? 
TENCHI: Don't worry, Sasami, I'll be-
AEKA: Lord Tenchi! What did that Barbarian do to you?
RYOKO:(shoves Aeka out of the way) My poor Tenchi! How about I give
you a little medical attention, if you know what I me-AHHHH!(Aeka
yanks her by the hair) WHAT WAS THAT FOR?
AEKA: I WAS HERE FIRST!
RYOKO: WHO CARES? I'M STILL GONNA GIVE HIM...(they continue to argue
in the backround)
SASAMI: Are you alright, Tenchi?
TENCHI: I'll be fine, Princess.
SASAMI: You don't look fine to me! You going to lay down for a while.
But first you're going to take bath. And then I'll fix you a special
tea that'll make you feel better!(Sasami and Tenchi leave)
MIHOSHI: Seion! Did you get hurt!
SEION: No-I mean, Yes! Can you help me?
MIHOSHI: Sure! I'll just use thoose massage techiques that my mother
taught me and you be feeling much better!(They leave)
NOBOYUKI: Well, I'd better go pick Kiyone up! See you later.
ASAKA: We'll be leaving to, Yosho.
YOSHO: Good-Bye.
AEKA:....THAT I'LL HAVE TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH TO TAKE MY SHOE OFF!
RYOKO: YOU KISS YOUR MOTHER WITH THAT MOUTH?(They both look around,
and not only is everybody gone, it's also about two hours after
they're fight started.)
YOSHO:(walking up the stairs) Are you two still here?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The next night at Kiyone's flower shop, "Chiisana Hana" The
whole gang, including Demi, Tetin, the Oki's in cabbit form, the
Knights and Megumi are there. There's a small "Grand Opening Party"
going on.
KIYONE: Thank you all so much! 
NOBOYUKI: Think nothing of it. You've worked hard to get this place
opened again. You deserve it.
KIYONE: I didn't do it all by myself. I couldn't have named the Koi
without Sasami's help.
TENCHI: You named the fish, Sasami? (Sasami giggles and gives herself
a playful knock on the head.) By the way, Kiyone, do you have my order
ready.
KIYONE: Here you go! (Kiyone hands Tenchi a dozen roses).
TENCHI: Thank you, Kiyone. And now on behalf of all of us I-
RYOKO&AEKA: For me? Oh, Tenchi! You shouldn't have!
TENCHI: But these are for K-
AEKA: Where do you get off thinking he would get a beast like you
anything as lovely as roses?
RYOKO: Why not? After all, I've got all the goods, Princess. And all
you've got is a flat ch-
AEKA: HOW DARE YOU EVEN TRY TO MAKE THAT REMARK!
RYOKO:(teleporting over to Tenchi) I must of hit pretty close to the
mark to get her all worked up like that! Ne, Tenchi? 
AEKA: You get away from Lord Tenchi right this minute!
RYOKO: I like it here! Think I'll stay right where I am!
TENCHI: Ryoko! Aeka! Please, no fighting to-
RYOKO: But she's being mean to me! And there's only one way to settle
it (teleports in front of Aeka) With swift blinding violence! (charges
up a fireball)
KIYONE: Wait a minute you two! Take you fight outs-
AEKA: Well then, if that's you attitude, WE FIGHT! (charges up her
Jurian power) ASAKA! KAMADAKI! STAND DOWN! I'll take this monster on
myself!
ASAKA&KAMADAKI: Yes, Your Highness!
MIHOSHI: Hey! She said-
RYOKO: HAH!(she lets loose her fireball, which Aeka easily avoids,
destroying a table full of flowers.
AEKA: HAhahahahahahahaha! Now it's my turn, Ryoko! (Aeka's energy
field goes off, not effecting Ryoko behind her force field, but
shatters quite a few windows in the greenhouse)
KIYONE: PLEASE STOP! YOU'RE DES-(They continue to fight, destroying
the counter, the cash register, almost all of the windows in the
greenhouse and nearly all of the plants)
SASAMI: AEKA! PLEASE STOP FIGHTING! (as Sasami says this an
inadvertant energy blast hurls toward the Koi pond where Sasami is
standing. In what seems to be an instinctual reaction, Seion leaps
toward Sasami, picks her up and springs off a rock near the pond just
a split second before the blast demolishes the pond.)
MEGUMI:(her leg is caught under one of the former tables) SOMEBODY
HELP ME!(just then the main suppor to the greenhouse falls toward her
but somehow it doesn't hit her. Whenshe looks up she see's Kamadaki,
who has put up his energy shield over her)
KAMADAKI: You don't have to worry..uh..Miss?
MEGUMI:(With a gleam in her eyes) Yes! It's Miss! Miss Megumi!(the
combat continues around them)
KIYONE:(crying)PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! STOP!(and with that Ryoko
comes crashing down into the last table thats still standing with a
loud crash)
RYOKO: ...oooo...my head...
AEKA: To bad, Ryoko. Looks like I win. AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA-(Aeka's
laughter is cut short by an open-handed slap to the face delivered by
Kiyone)
KIYONE:(with tears in her eyes) I...I...(she runs out of the shop
sobbing)
AEKA: How dare she!
RYOKO: (dusting herself off) Yeah! She's got alot of nerve getting
involved in our fight!(They both procede towards the door Kiyone went
out but are stopped when Tenchi steps in front of them)
TENCHI: And just where do you two think YOU'RE going?
RYOKO: She got involved in a fight that didn't involve her!
AEKA: And she dared to strike a member of the Royal Family! We 're
going to demand a apolo-
TENCHI: YOU TWO HAVE NO RIGHT TO HAVE HURT FEELINGS RIGHT NOW! LOOK AT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE! AND OVER WHAT? THESE?(he holds up the roses) They
were for Kiyone! Me, Sasami and her brother got them for her as a
gift, but since you two want them so much, take them!(he throws them
down at thier feet and leaves)
RYOKO: What kind of ideas did you put in his head, Seion?
SEION: None at all. He just finally grew some balls! And if you think
he's mad, I'm doing all I can to keep from pulling you spine out
through your mouth! Good day.(he calmly walks out with Mihoshi)
AEKA: What's wrong Sasami?(she walks over to her sister who is by what
is left of the Koi pond)
SASAMI: The poor fishies. They didn't ever hurt anybody. Why didn't
you stop fighting! I asked to stop! Why do you always have to fight
with Ryoko?! I HATE YOU WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THIS,AEKA! (Sasami runs out
crying)
AEKA:(turning black and white with a shocked and then saddened look on
her face)...Oh, no. Sasami hates? Sasami hates me.(she starts crying)
ASAKA: Are you alright Miss Demi? 
DEMI:(jokingly) Two mild concussions, 130 broken bones, five ruptured
organs, and a massive cerribral hemmorage, but other than that I'm
fine.
KAMADAKI: It looks like nobody was seriosly injured.
DEMI: Uhhhh..Why do you have a backpack shaped like Megumi?
MEGUMI: Isn't he just the most KAWAII Jurian you've ever seen.
KEN-OKI: CHAIO!
TETIN: NAYO! NAYO!
RYO-OKI: Miya?
NAGI:(to Ryo-oki) How would I know?
TENTIN: NAYO!
YOSHO: Are they fighting over Ryo-oki?
NAGI: No!
DEMI: They're fight over which is better: carrots or Shnookies!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Outside of what's left of the shop. Tenchi and Seion are
talking.
SEION: I'm really proud of you, Tenchi. From what I've heard, that's
the frist time you've ever laid down the law on those two.
TENCHI: I'm not through with them yet. I've got something planned for
them. By the way, have you seen Dad? He took off with the van.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The lake outside of the Masaki Residence. Kiyone is sitting on
a rock looking out over the lake crying
KIYONE:(to herself) ..why did this have to happen? I've never done
anything to deserve this. I can't take this any more.....
NOBOYUKI:(from behind her) Is this seat taken?
KIYONE: Huh? Oh, it's you. It's your place. You can sit wherever you
like. 
NOBOYUKI: I can tell you upset, but I hope you don't decide to go
through with what you where thinking about doing.
KIYONE: Why shouldn't I? I've got nothing. Every time there's a little
happiness in my life something comes along and snatches it away from
me. Just like tonight. I'm tired of making sacrafices so somebody else
can have a little temporary joy. I want something for myself. But at
the rate I'm going I'll never have anything but sadness in my life.
Seion and Mihoshi are the closest things to a family I've left.
NOBOYUKI: You've got me. If you ever need a shoulder to cry on, I'm
here.
KIYONE: Thank you. That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
NOBOYUKI: So you won't be leaving us forever?
KIYONE: Now I finally know what Achika saw in you all those years ago.
Underneath it all, you're sensitive, caring man.
NOBOYUKI:(as he puts his arm on her shoulder) Just don't let this get
out. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: In the Living Room later that night. Tenchi is having it out
with his admirers.
TENCHI: Here's the deal if you want to continue to live here. From now
one you two will not only get along, but you will do everthing
together. When one of you goes to sleep, you both go to sleep. When
one of you works, the other will be there to help her. When one of you
takes a bath, the other will be there to wash her back. When one of
you sneezes, the other will be there to wipe her nose. And absolutely
NO fighting or insults. You two are going to start behaving like
sisters. And just to make my point clear, you two will be sleeping in
the same room together.
And one more thing................
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Flower shop a month later.(but I thought it was desrtoyed.
just read on)
NORIKO: Thank you. Kintaro will love these! Goodbye!
KIYONE: Come Back soon! Aeka! Ryoko!
AEKA&RYOKO: Yes, ma'am!
KIYONE: I'm going to get lunch. Now I know Washu made this place
indestuctable and that she has cut off your powers, but try not to
wreck the place! Noboyuki worked hard on this design and-Aw hell! I
leave Sasami in charge. Sasami! (Sasami and another girl{Misao from
Pretty Sammy} walk in) You're in charge until I get back!(Kiyone
leaves)
SASAMI: You heard her! Now Aeka, get on the Kareoke machine and keep
the customers entertained. And Ryoko, you start watering the flowers!
Me and Misao will be at the Koi pond if you need us.
RYOKO: I hate it when Sasami's in charge.
AEKA: I never thought my sweet, little sister could be such a slave
driver.
RYOKO: It must run in the family.
AEKA: WHY I gad-rana......Oh-hohohohohoho! You such a joker, Ryoko
dear.
RYOKO: That's alright..(groan)....Aeka-sama.
(the camera pulls away from the camera shop the Aeka starts singing
her Kareoke song[the one from the TV series, and believe me, the
Japanese version is much better]).

CUE ENDING SONG:"Police Magic" By The Galaxy Police (this version has
not been recorded but I can dream, can't I) This ending is done in the
style of a "COPS" opening. Seion chases down and tackles Noboyuki for
peeping (what else) Mihoshi is seen pulling up in her car, jumping out
and running into the donut shop. Kiyone is arresting Aeka for
pandering (a nice way of saying prostitution) Ryoko is resisting
arrest by Demi, and Megumi and Troz are filling out accident reports
involving a police officer in a hurry to get to a donut shop (guess
who).

CUE NEXT EPISODE MUSIC
SEION: You want me to be your what?
TENCHI: In our next Episode I give Seion the title of Sempai, but
there is a little confusion among the girls as to what that term 
means when they ask Kiyone about her love life and another girl.
KIYONE: She was just my Sempai. I was only 17. I don't do that
anymore!
AEKA: He's leading Lord Tenchi astray!
SEION: Hey, I don't swing that way!
TENCHI: And that's just before the first commercial! Don't miss our
next Episode No Need For Sempai! It's amazing the way these girls 
jump to conclusions!
NOBOYUKI: Kiyone and another woman? Hmmmm...
KIYONE: I tell you about it later.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Notes:
	1. Megumi is based on no one in particular (she is not named
after Megumi Hayashibara but after Megumi Morisato of Ah! My Goddess!)
but she is really starved for attention.
	2. Before anyone says "Don't you think Aeka and Ryoko would have
enough respect not to level Kiyone's shop?" just remeber that they
don't even have enough respect for TENCHI not to fight in his house,
much less the flower shop of someone to whom they're indifferent
towards! If these two were in a really heated fight (trying to
actually kill each other rather than trying to show the other up)
they'd vaporize Tenchi if he got in the way! Sure, they'd feel really,
really bad about it later, but these are the two most pig-headed,
temperamental, and possessive women in the universe and they're not
going to let a little thing like respect get in their way. They only
reason that Tenchi get's them to stop fighting is their love for him,
which is even stronger than their dislike for each other.(they are
alot alike, aren't they? Maybe that's why they can't get along
sometimes and other times they seem the best of friends....)
	3. What are Shnookies? Why they're the most popular snack food in
this part of the Galaxy!
(actually in the first TM comic book [see below] Demi gives Tetin
something to eat and it looks like he really enjoys it as much as
Ryo-oki enjoys carrots so I decided to give them a name.)
	4. Demi was first featured in the Tenchi Muyo comic put out by
Pioneer about March 1997.
She's a cat-like alien who also happens to have a cabbit named Tetin.
The voice I chose for her is Tomo Sakurai, best know for playing
Shayla-Shayla from El-Hazard. If you'd like to see my pictures of Demi
