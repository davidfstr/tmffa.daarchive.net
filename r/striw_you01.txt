Disclaimer: I don't own any of these characters. In fact, I don't even know
who does so that takes care of that. Actually, I DO own the characters
Joshua
and Katharine.
This is also my first fanfic, so if you don't like it, please don't sue me
and please don't send any e-mail bombs.lol.
This story takes place after the OAV series.
I guess this is a response to GenSao's challenge, but I'm not quite sure,
seeing as how I'm an idiot.
 Now on with the story!

Someone to Realize It Was You

***********************************************************************

It was another beautiful day at the Masaki household. The birds were
chirping, the sun was shining, and half the house was blowing up.
"Ryokooooooo!" Tenchi strained his voice over the sounds of sheetrock and
wood chips crumbling to the floor.
Ryoko shot a glare his way.
"Stop this, Ryoko. Let's all just sit down, talk, and later we can discuss
insurance plans for the future, because EVERY time you and Ayeka have a
little fight, it causes BIG damage, and we can't afford that right now!" He
was now at the point where his arms were crossed and he took on that
disgruntles look that hardly crossed his face. When he said they couldn't
afford it, he meant it. Nobiyuki had been out of work for months because of
a
leg injury, caused financial stress on the entire family.
 "Ryoko slowly lowered herself to the floor from where she was hovering, and
a moment later disappeared, mumbling again.
    Ayeka, pretty much forgotten until just about that moment, was lying on
the floor, a few feet away. Her violet hair was tousled, her face covered
with dust, and her kimono just about as wrinkled as it could be. Obviously,
Ayeka wasn't very prim at the moment. She had seen better days Obviously
trying to defend herself, small energy logs surrounded her. Behind Tenchi, a
few more pieces of plaster fell, and he made his way over to Ayeka.
    The logs blinked out of sight as Tenchi bent over and offered his hand
to
the princess.
As he pulled her to her feet, he let out a sigh.
"My deepest apologies, Lord Tenchi" Ayeka whispered. "Just another petty
argument between that monst... I mean, Ryoko and I"
She gave a short bow. Lately, on her part, she was refraining from calling
Ryoko a monster.
"Ayeka, there must be a way for you two to work something out. I'm sorry I
cannot understand where you two get set off, but it would be a great favor
to
me if you can possibly try to keep from actual physical fighting from now
on"

When Ayeka just looked at him, posing an awkward silence, he just turned
around and said, "Ayeka, just promise me, ok?"
 "Yes Lord Tenchi" she responded and she turned on her heel and made her way
up the stairs.
    Tenchi winced at the sound of her voice. Sad, but not cold. Something
was
up. Perhaps they way he spoke was too icy. Oh well. Talking was for later.
    The two girls had been fighting worse lately, and Tenchi was walking
aroound as if he had a sandbag tied to his chest. Now 25, he knew the girls
were getting tired of waiting for him. The choice had to be made. But he
didn't want to be the one to make it.

First chapter, kind of a prologue, but it gets way intense  later, trust me.
