     Ryouko reached deeper into her soul.
     Somewhere, deep inside her, was what she wanted.  Buried down
beneath everything that made her sentient, beneath everything
that made her civilized, beneath everything that made her even a  
semi-functional member of society, even beneath the instincts
that made her a social creature, there was something primal she  
wanted to tap.
    Her eyes narrowed.  She’d found it.
     She opened her mouth and screamed.  Her arm whip-snapped
back behind her head in a blur.  When it came forward, he hand held
a bolt of pure plasma.
     Her scream degenerated into a feral snarl.  Energy crackled
and writhed about her arm, the charged particles ionizing beyond
the point of control or even of physical coherency...
     First the beam, then her fist impacted the sheer rock face.  A  
quarter-mile wide swath of stone vaporized.  The air about her  
exploded as flash-gas super-expanded.  The shockwave whipped her hair
about and tore at her clothing.  The sonic boom of the overpressure
could be heard in Tokyo.
     Japanese national consciousness cringed as a bright light and  
faster-than-thought mach-wave spread over the land.  Hiroshima
and Nagasaki hadn’t been so long ago...
     Ryouko let her breath hiss out between her teeth.  The mountain
was gone.  Not rubble, not gravel, not dirt...
     Just gone.
     It wasn’t enough.
     It wasn’t NEARLY enough.
     She tilted her head back and screamed.  Her body shot forward,
arrowing for the next mountain in the range, plasma already crackling
about her fist...

     It had started a few months ago.
     Tenchi had never been one to choose one girl over the other.
In the end, his personality makeup wouldn’t let him.  But as he’d  
grown and matured, his attraction to them had become unbearable.
     He had slept with Aeka.
     And then he’d told Ryouko.
     She’d stared, openmouthed, as he’d confessed the act.  About
how they’d been walking by the shore of the lake, under the  
moonlight, and how one thing had led to another.
     She wanted to be angry.  She could see the truth in his eyes.
But it was just too much.  Her emotions were too overloaded,
too blasted and frazzled to power a reaction.  So she’d just stood
and listened.
     And then he’d told her he loved her.
     Told her that he knew that she was the strong one.  That though
he knew it would cause her pain, that he had to be honest with  
someone, and that he trusted her, knew she could handle the knowledge
even better than he.
     That he was in love with them both, and could give neither
up.
     That he’d slept with Aeka.
     That he still loved Ryouko.
     That he was afraid that Aeka couldn’t handle that idea.  That
to her, his act had consummated, perhaps even consecrated,
his relationship to the princess, and that to love another would now
be seen as proof he didn’t truly love her.
     That he couldn’t sleep with both of them.  That he’d feel he’d
be betraying Aeka’s trust.
     But that he still loved Ryouko.
     That he wanted to call her his Beloved.
     That he thought of her first thing in the morning and last thing
at night.
     That he dreamed of her.
     That she brought light to his world.
     That he loved her with all his heart.
     But that he loved Aeka just as much.
     He’d asked her to understand.  Told her that he couldn’t give
up the physical relationship he now had with Aeka.  He loved the  
princess too much to deny her.
     But that it didn’t mean he didn’t love Ryouko too.
     But she couldn’t tell.
     That it had to be a secret that he loved her.
     That one day, when he could, he’d tell Aeka.  Or if not, then
he’d have to choose.
     And then, crying, he’d left her.
     And Ryouko had stood silently, still openmouthed, still staring.

     She’d agreed.
     She’d justified to herself that she loved Tenchi, and that his
reasoning was valid.  Aeka COULDN’T handle the idea that Tenchi loved
another, even as he made love to her.  And he undoubtedly loved the
princess.  So to argue, to fight, or to tell Aeka, would have hurt
Tenchi immeasurably.
     And perhaps she’d lose Tenchi altogether in the process.
     So Ryouko kept her peace.  Tenchi, to his credit, had been true
to his word.  He stole many private moments with Ryouko, and in those
moments he was as tender and as loving as she could ever have hoped.
They’d held each other under moonlit nights, and walked hand in hand,
staring into each other’s eyes.  And they’d kissed so deeply and  
powerfully that he’d told her that it was like an act of religion...
     But he never made love to her.
     And he was making love to Aeka.
     Ryouko’d gritted her teeth and born it as best she could.  She
hadn’t wanted to broach the issue.  She knew Tenchi felt guilty about
it, that it would pain him if she revealed her own distress.  For  
that matter, she was afraid he might think she was interested
only in the physical, that she couldn’t be satisfied with being  
loved, that she had to have sex.  So she’d held her tongue.  Oh,  
she’d been subversive... she’d done her best on more than one  
occasion to arouse Tenchi to the point where he lost control and  
pounced upon her.  But somehow, he’d never quite lost control when
she’d been truly desperate, and when she wasn’t truly desperate
Ryouko never had the heart to force him to betray himself.  Their
libidos seemed permanently out of sync.  And so it had gone on for  
months.
     Then there had been this weekend.
     Tenchi had left her a note, and she stole into his bedroom
on Thursday night, as she often did.  Usually during such nocturnal
visits they kissed and played and groped in a parody of near-sex
that served to quell their lust just enough to make life liveable.
But Thursday night he hadn’t been playful at all.
     “Ryouko,” he’d told her, “tomorrow night Aeka and I are leaving
for Dewa province for the weekend.  She wants to ‘get away’ for a few
days.”
     The demon had nodded and kept her peace.  She didn’t like it.   
At all.  In fact, the idea of them alone for a weekend made her  
physically ill.  But she didn’t know what was right here.  She’d  
agreed to this arrangement, after all.  Did she have any right to be
jealous?  If she really loved him truly, would she be so possessive?
Doubts assailed her.  So she said nothing.  Tenchi had left her  
bedroom, clearly upset, clearly knowing that what he was doing was  
hurting Ryouko.  But the next day he’d left with Aeka all the same.
     He even called her with his cellular phone during the drive to  
Dewa while Aeka slept in the passenger seat, to whisper to Ryouko
that he loved her.
     Once he hung up, Ryouko cried until her eyes were sore.
     He loved her... but he was still going to Dewa with Aeka.  Where
they’d make love.
     Something he’d denied her.  And would continue to deny her for
the foreseeable future.
     Maybe forever.
     The next morning, she awoke in a murderous rage.  Her every  
thought was of Tenchi and Aeka, conjoined in the act of love in some
luxurious room in some mountain hideaway in Dewa.  She tried to  
banish the thoughts by thinking of the happy times she’d spent with
Tenchi, but they were swept away by the avalanche of her fearful
imaginings.  She’d tried to calm herself by looking at pictures
of Tenchi, but so many of them had been taken by Aeka...
     It was just too much.
    She couldn’t confront Tenchi, demand that he make a choice.
She just couldn’t ask him to give up someone he loved.
     No matter how much it hurt her that he was With another.
     And anyhow, He’d been with Aeka on a much more intimate level
now, and been with her for a pretty long period.  Ryouko had come to
feel as though she were a mistress, and Aeka was his wife.  Aeka was
well established, a regular partner and, in the eyes of the world,
Tenchi’s “official” girlfriend.  If she demanded he choose, wouldn’t
it be logical for him to choose Aeka?
     Even worse would be if he cast her off “for her own good.”  If  
she let him know she was hurting, he might leave her just to spare
her further pain.  He was like that.
     She had neither the callousness nor the bravery to demand  
anything.
     But she had to do something.
     And so she’d flown to Shinano province, and found herself some
mountains...

     The second precipice of the day vaporized in an outpouring
of matter, energy, and plasma.  Ryouko growled menacingly at the  
crater.
     “TENCHI, I HATE YOU!!!!” she screamed.  She rapid-fired
several blasts of ball lightning into the still-smoking ground.
Smoke enveloped her.  Gravel stung her as it blasted past her,  
propelled by her own attack.
      She could have stopped the debris with her chi-shield,
but the pain felt too comforting.
     A small piece of her worried.  A small piece of her thought
that her relationship with Tenchi was being asphyxiated, slowly  
strangled by the resentment she was now giving voice to.  That even
if one day he chose her, that she’d never feel right about him.  The
same piece of her wondered at the fact that she didn’t resent Aeka.
Then again, how could she?  Aeka didn’t know...
     She began to sob.
     A JSDF F-16 chose that moment to streak by her, its astonished
pilot frantically radioing his base that there was a lone woman  
FLOATING in space above the Shinano hills, and that she was the cause
of the destruction.  Before his bewildered superiors could ask him to
confirm his report, Ryouko had teleported away.
     She’d not cry where any could see her.

     It was funny.  The cave had so long been the place of her worst
fears.
     But now she could think of no other place where she could go and
be truly alone.  Her tears had long since ceased, having run in small
rivulets down her face and into the icy cold depths of the central
pool.  Now she sat on the cold stone floor, hugging her knees to her
chest and rocking back and forth, her eyes tightly shut.
     She whispered, “I love you. I hate you.  I love you. I hate you”
over and over again.
     When Tenchi returned from the weekend, she’d meet him with a  
smile.  She’d deny all knowledge of the incredible paroxysm of  
violence that had rocked Shinano.
      But until then, she was giving voice to her pain.
