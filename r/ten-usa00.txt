Prologue 

		Morning

	"Wake up Tenchi... wake up." 
	"Ahh!" Yawned Tenchi as he slowly began to open his eyes, "but do I really 
have to, mom?"  
	"Not if you want to be late for school." said his mother.  
	This caused Tenchi to spontaneously jump out of bed, push his mother out 
of his room, get dressed in his usual quick and sloppy manner, and grab his 
backpack as he bolted out the door of his house.  It was just another routine 
morning for Tenchi Adams.  In fact, Tenchi was quite worried with just how 
routine it really was, as he parked his rusty old pickup in the school parking 
lot and hurried toward his first class of the day.  

		Fifth Period

	Tenchi's day was for the most part uneventful up until his fifth period 
class, physics.  Upon entering the class, Tenchi noticed that his teacher, Mr. 
Tranbarger, was not there and took his normal place in the center of the first 
row assuming he was just out getting something for the day's lesson.  After 
waiting for approximately two minutes, a young woman of about twenty-five years 
of age entered the classroom, causing all of the male students in the class 
except for Tenchi to whistle at her wildly.  This all stopped when she calmly 
proceeded to the front of the room, all the while ignoring the class.  
	"Your teacher Mr. Tranbarger, will not be here today due to the flu, I 
will be your substitute teacher for the day." Said the woman in a heavenly 
voice.  
	_Wow,_ thought Tenchi with wide eyes as he examined the stranger for the 
first time, for he had never seen her prior to her entry into the classroom.  
She was about six feet three inches tall, had spiky bright red voluminous 
ponytail that dragged on the floor whenever she walked, bright green eyes and 
the kind of lips that could melt ice.  
	"My name is Washu Habuki, please call me either little Washu or Miss 
Washu," she announced to the class.  "Now, what were you learning in here 
yesterday?" she asked the class, curiously eyeing Tenchi.  
	"We just started learning about motion in two dimensions," yelled some one 
behind Tenchi.  
	"Thank you," she said, sounding somehow sad when Tenchi did not answer, 
"that's all you've done in this class so far?"  
	"It's only the third month we've been in this class, what do you expect?"  
Complained a student in the second row in a slightly demanding and angry tone.  
	"Who said that?" asked Washu getting a little angry.  
	"I did"  
	"And what is your name, sir?"  
	"Casey Wright" answered the student beginning to show signs of regret for 
his earlier comment.  
	"Well, Mr. Wright, I was learning advanced quantum mechanics when I was 
three, and at the school I used to work at before I retired I was teaching the 
physics students in my class, who are the same age as you, beginning level 
quantum mechanics." said Washu while walking toward Casey.  
	"Retired, you're to young to be retired," said Tenchi opening his mouth 
for the first time in the class period.  
	"Why thank you Tenchi."  
	"Huh?  How do you know my name already?"  
	"I bet I know a lot more about you than even you do."  
	"Ooooooh," yelled the males in the class almost simultaneously.  
	"Um," whined Tenchi looking very embarrassed, "what's that supposed to 
mean?" continued Tenchi, mostly to himself.  
	_Uhh, this class period has started off on a down note, Please don't let 
anything else like this happen today,_ Tenchi prayed to whoever would listen, 
_what's with this anyway?  Mr. Tranbarger is never absent, not even when he's 
sick.  Oh well._  Tenchi pushed the thought out of his mind. 
	"Anyway, let's start today's lesson, shall we?" asked Washu.  
	Fortunately for the rest of the period Tenchi's prayers were answered, the 
lesson began with Washu explaining the physics of circular motion and the
dynamics of centripetal force and why centrifugal force is not a force at all.  
The class then went on to perform an experiment based on her short lecture, 
which the class thought was much easier to understand than Mr. Tranbarger's 
lectures usually were, the class probably even learned more than they would have 
learned if Tranbarger had been teaching.  
	"Tenchi, could I please speak with you after school?" asked Washu as 
everybody was leaving.  
	"Ummm, sure," said Tenchi.  
	"Okay, just come in the classroom after school, I'll be here, I promise," 
said Washu.  
	Tenchi had a difficult time swallowing the lump in his throat Washu's last 
comment had caused, as he walked off to his last class of the day.  

		Washu's Revelation

	"Umm, Miss Washu?"  Asked Tenchi knocking on the door of the classroom, 
"Miss Washu, are you there?"  
	"I told you to just come in, didn't I?" Asked Washu as she slowly opened 
the door.  
	"The door was locked."  
	"Oh," responded Washu flatly.  "Then why don't you come in now?"  
	"Well, anyway, Miss Washu, what did you want to talk to me about?" 
questioned the young man as he entered the classroom.  
	"You," she said rather bluntly.  
	Tenchi swallowed hard, "What do you mean by that?  Did I do something 
wrong today?" questioned Tenchi, his voice suddenly becoming very tense.  
	"Hehe," laughed Washu, "no, for the love of Tsunami, not like that, gee, 
what kind of girl do you think I am?  Though, I must say, you are pretty cute," 
she noticed Tenchi turn red with her comment.  "But, seriously Tenchi, have you 
ever wondered about our name?"  
	"Huh? My name? What's wrong with my name!"  
	"Oh, nothing, just the fact the your first name is Japanese in origin and 
neither of your parents or grand parents are Japanese."  
	"No, I was adopted at a very early age, I never knew any of my blood 
relatives. All I really know about them is that they were from Japan.  So, why 
do you care, anyway?"  
	"Oh, no reason at all, except..." Washu sounded very hesitant.  
	"Except what?"  
	"Except...I knew your grandfather, he was one of my better students back 
at the Academy."  
	"What!? You knew my real grandfather!  Academy?  What Academy!?  How!?  
What was he like!?" begged Tenchi, becoming somewhat over excited,  "Please, 
tell me everything you know about him."  
	"Yes, Tenchi I did know him, and I will tell you everything you want to 
know, all in due time, but first Tenchi, can I please show you something, it 
might make this a little easier?"  
	"Umm, sure, why?  Hey... wait a minute, how do you know it was my 
grandfather you knew?  I mean I don't even know my real last name." asked Tenchi 
regaining his composure.  
	"Your last name is Misaki, I'll explain how I know later.  And, you'll see 
why it will make things easier when we get there.  Now, let's head out to my car 
then, it's quite a ways away."  
	"Well, if it is that far away, don't you think I should at least stop by 
my house and at least tell my mother where I'm going?"  
	"Yeah, you probably should," agreed Washu, "we'll be gone for several 
days."  
	"Um, okay, I need to take my truck home, so could you follow me there in 
your car?"  
	"No problem," said Washu happily.  
	"Well, let's go then, I'll drive over and wait in front of the teacher's 
parking lot for you, what kind of car do you have, so I'll be able to recognize 
you when I see you?"  
	"You'll know my car when you see it." Washu said and started heading 
toward the staff parking lot.  
	"Okay... Whatever."  Tenchi mumbled, heading to his truck.  
	Tenchi's mouth dropped down to his knees when he saw the car.  It was a 
shinny, bright yellow Ferrari F50.  Well, I guess that's what Washu meant.  
Tenchi thought, finding it difficult to keep from drooling all over his pants.  
For the entire trip back to Tenchi's house he found it extremely difficult to 
drive straight and look at Miss Washu's beautiful sports car.  Just the high 
pitch rumbling of the car's engine made Tenchi want to pull over to the side of 
the road and pray to the gods in hope that Washu would let him drive it.  The 
soft curves, the bright colored aerospace fiberglass soothed both Tenchi's mind 
and body just by him looking at it.  Somehow the sound of the car's 60° V-12 
running at high rpm's lulled his sense down to dangerous levels and almost made 
him forget the events of the past half hour.  Yet, somehow, amazingly, Tenchi 
was able to make it to his home with out incident.  

		Tenchi's Mother

	When Tenchi and Washu arrived at his house, Tenchi nervously walk over to 
Washu, still sitting in her car and asked her if she would like to meet his 
mother.  Washu gladly accepted.  
	"Mom, I'm home," yelled Tenchi as soon as he entered his house, "and I 
brought someone with me I'd like you to meet."  
	"Okay, just a second Tenchi," replied a somewhat worn yet friendly voice 
from the back of the house.  
	"Please, won't you come in Miss Washu?" said Tenchi.  
	"Why, thank you Tenchi," Washu said entering his house for the first time.  
	Although it was the first time Washu had ever entered Tenchi's home, she 
already knew the exact layout of the entire building by heart.  If she wanted 
to, she could go from any one point in the home to any other point.  Her 
knowledge of the home was through enough that, unless you already knew 
otherwise, she could fool you into thinking that she had lived there for several 
years.  She was so familiar with house's interior that even the slightest detail 
did not surprise her.  
	"No problem, it's the least I could do, considering whatever you must know 
about my family is probably going to be the most important information I'll ever 
hear in my life.  Even if it's just a little bit." 
	"Wow, Tenchi, so you've finally brought home a girl, I see, it's about 
time, but isn't she a little old for you?" asked Tenchi's adopted mother, only 
just now entering the living room.  
	"No, mom, nothing it's like that. She was a substitute teacher in my 
physics class today..."  
	"Oh, so you're going after the teachers now Tenchi?" interrupted his 
mother.  
	"Mom, will you listen for a second!  She says she was an acquaintance of 
my real grandfather. She even told me my real last name is Misaki."  
	With this statement she closely examined the new guest to her house.  "Oh, 
Washu, I didn't realize it was you."
	"Don't worry about, I wasn't expecting you to, besides, I look quite 
different since from last time we spoke."
	Meanwhile, Tenchi just stood there wide-mouthed, not believing what he was 
hearing.
	"You're early, Little Washu.  I wasn't expecting you to come for another 
year or two," admitted Tenchi's mom still somewhat surprised at Washu's sudden 
appearance, "I was hoping I would at least get to see him get married before you 
took him."
	"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Mrs. Adams.  I predict that Tenchi will 
be married with in a year."  Washu assured Tenchi's mother, "Anyway, some..." 
Washu hesitated, "...things have come up."
	"Miss Washu, what are you talking about?" asked Tenchi.  
	"Some..." Washu hesitated again, "...unexpected events surrounding one of 
your great-grandparents have led to my early arrival.  I don't know if you're 
ready for me to tell you yet."
	"Wait a minute, if I have a living great-grandparent then why did he not 
take me in?"  
	"You'll see when you meet him, but right now he doesn't even know of your 
existence, he..."  
	Both Washu and Tenchi looked over at his mother when they heard her start 
sobbing.  
	"So... Tenchi I guess it's good-bye; for now," she said, with tears slowly 
rolling down her cheeks.
	"Yes, Mrs. Adams, I am sorry I have to do this, but it will only be for a 
week or two."  
	Upon hearing this Tenchi's mother became relieved and slowly stopped her 
sobs, "Okay then, I guess it's okay. Tenchi you go pack your things, while I 
speak with Miss Washu."  
	"Oh that won't be necessary, I have everything we'll need" said Washu.  

		Transformation and Abduction

	As they walked out to Washu's car, Tenchi could not help being excited 
that he would be privileged enough to deserve a ride in a Ferrari F50.  
	"Would you like to drive, Tenchi?" Asked Washu.  
	"Yes!" gasped Tenchi in surprise.  
	"Hehe, okay, here's the key, get in," urged Washu as she tossed the key to 
Tenchi.  
	Tenchi unlocked the door slowly and sat down in the cockpit of the car 
being extra careful not to scratch the paint as he did so. Tenchi just sat there 
in a mass of euphoria as he waited for Washu to go around the back of the car 
and get in. Unexpectedly, instead of Washu getting in the car a small girl of 
about eleven or twelve years of age got in. The girl had Washu's long red hair, 
and her bright green eyes, but this is clearly impossible thought Tenchi, people 
don't just suddenly get younger.  
	"Okay, go," said the girl.  
	"What?  What about Washu, where did she go?"  
	"Hehe, I am Washu silly."  
	"But...but Washu is older," Tenchi stumbled over his words.
	"I know I am, I just prefer to be in this form."  
	Now Tenchi was confused.  "Um, okay, I'm not going to ask."  
	With out further thought Tenchi put the key into the ignition and started 
the car. 
	The low rumble of the engine made Tenchi's heart rate rise, his skin 
tense. He immediately put the car in gear and started toward down the street and 
started following Washu's directions.  
	"Um, this will do, turn left here," Washu said after having Tenchi drive 
them out into the country for about half an hour.  
	"Tenchi, do you see that red button right there, in the steering wheel?" 
Asked Washu...
	...To which Tenchi pointed, "You mean this one?"
	"Yes, push it."  
	"Okay."  
	As soon as Tenchi pressed the red button, a bright reddish green light 
engulfed the car and it leaped about a hundred feet into the air causing Tenchi 
to scream. The car continued into the air and was eventually pulled into an 
opening in the bottom of a gigantic spacecraft.
	Tenchi found himself sitting next to Washu; still in the car; in the 
center of a large room with a big transparent half dome at one end.  Tenchi 
looked out as he saw Earth rapidly shrinking in the distance until it was no 
more than a speck of light. About half a minute later Mars zoomed by and also 
disappeared into the darkness of space.  
	"Wow," Tenchi gasped as he faint from the fear of having been abducted by 
aliens, because that is what Tenchi thought had happened.
