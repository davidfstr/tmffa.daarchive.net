I do not Own these characters, although I wished I owned Ryoko, however AIC
and Pioneer do :(

I had this idea sometime ago. What do you think.

Ryoko's Sacrafice
by RingPrincess

Ryoko sneaked down the stairs in the middle of the night and headed towards
Washu's lab. She tentavily knocked on the door and wasn't surprised to
hear an irate,

"GO AWAY!"

Ryoko took a deep breathe and swallowed her pride.

"Mom, can I talk to you?"

The door opened so fast and Ryoko was jerked in before she knew what
was happening.

"Who are you and what did you do to Ryoko?" Washu demanded.

Ryoko sneered. "I'm fine."

"I have things to do, Little Ryoko. Get on with it."

Ryoko bit back her typical response to the little comment.

"You have been having trouble with getting Mayuka to adjust to the cloning 
chamber."
Ryoko stated factually.

Washu cocked her head at her daughter. "Yes, I have, but how did you know, 
Little Ryoko."

"You've felt, frustrated. I guess." Ryoko  said slowly. She then hurried on, 
"Anyway, I
think I have a solution to your problem."

Washu raised an eyebrow. "I am always willing to take suggestions."

Ryoko gave a big smile, her eyes lighting up.

"But," Washu held up a finger. "That does not mean I have to take them."

Ryoko's face fell.

"I just want to help." She whispered.

"Unless you can find some way to adjust the tank so that May can regenerate, 
I don't
know what you can do Ryoko." Washu said tiredly.

Ryoko swallowed. Hard. "I wasn't thinking about it that way really."

Washu raised an eyebrow. "Then, what is your idea."

Ryoko looked up and stared her mother in the eye. She radiated sincerity.

"I want to carry Mayuka."

Okay, so I know it's short. Well, tell me. . . good, bad, indifferant. To 
tell the truth I've
never seen this idea anywhere else. So help me.
