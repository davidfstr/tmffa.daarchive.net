Kiyonne's Big Date and how Mihoshi affected it.


	Everything was perfect.  Kiyonne's favorite meal by candle light, imported 
wine, and
Tenchi was going to take Mihoshi out to dinner and a movie.  Kiyonne and 
Mihoshi had been
patrolling around Saturn for the last ten hours and after Mihoshi was 
dropped off at Tenchi's
Kiyonne would come home and fine him waiting for her.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	It had been about eight month since Xavier had been sent to earth... The 
Galaxy
Police had decided to post another agent ther when it was learned that the 
future king of
Jurai was living there.  It sounded like a vacation to Xavier who had been 
in the GP Special
Forces for the last two years.  When he heard that Kiyonne was stationed 
there, it sounded like
heaven.  He went through the academy hearing of all the records that were 
set by Kiyonne, he
had just about decided that she was a stuck-up little b****, he saw a 
picture of her.  For him
it was love at first sight.  He just hoped that she would feel the same way.

	He arrived at the apartment late one evening around eleven o'clock.
"Excuse me, I know I'm early, but this location was listed as the earth 
barrack, and I was
	in a hurry to get sett..."
He was cut off when he saw a green mask on the blondes face.  She apparently 
forgot it was on.
She wasn't used to seeing 6'5" males with shoulder length brown hair 
(especially in a GP uniform)
"You must be Mihoshi.." he continued as he extended his hand.
She shook his hand still startled at the strangers arrival.
A voice from inside said, "Mihoshi! That's probably Agent Xavier.  Just show 
her in and..."
As she came into view she continued "Oh!  I'm sorry the gave me the 
impression you were a girl!"
	He thought she was even more beautiful when she blushed.
"I hope I'm not disappointing you.  My name is Xavier, and I was sent hear 
'to make sure the Jurain
	prince is kept out of harms way' (not entirely mocking but in the voice of 
the computer that
	dispatched him)."
Kiyonne was trying to contain her giggling and Mihoshi was crying with 
delight [and deafening laughter].
Xavier was trying to decide if his computer impression was that funny or he 
missed the joke
	completly.  He decided on the latter.
"I guess we should help him in Mihoshi."  Kiyonne was still fighting her 
giggles.  "I gues I know why
	they said could talk about hair with you."
"So when do I get to find out what is so funny?"
"Oh!!,"  just noticing her mask.  "We'll take you over there tommorow 
morning!"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Xavier quickly understood the joke after meeting Tenchi (who was closely 
followed by a dueling
Ayeka and Ryoko).  He sighed when he realized this wasn't the vacation he 
had expected.  Over the next
three days he re-arranged the schedule so that he could rotate with Kiyonne 
and Mihoshi on patrol duties.
They didn't mind, that meant they could spend more time relaxing (more on 
Kiyonnes part).  He would often
spend the patrols quizzing Mihoshi over his and Kiyonnes' likes and dislikes 
(and Mihoshis' so it
wouldn't sound strange when she told Kiyonne) or trying to get closer to 
Kiyonne.

	The sleeping arangement hadn't been so bad he was in the main room while 
Kiyonne and Mihoshi
shared the bedroom.  Still the apartment was cramped and he couldn't find a 
moments privacy with Kiyonne
and she was always so professional during patrols.  (*Xaviers is very 
unaware of what a heavy sleeper
Mihoshi is*)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Xavier finally found his moment to let Kiyonne know how he felt about her.  
Tenchi would have
Mihoshi pre-occupied and Kiyonne would be home any minute.

	He was becoming increasingly nervous as the heard her approaching.
"I'm sorry Tenchi was sick, Mihoshi.  Why are you so upset though?"
Xavier: (Great, my first chance with Kiyonne in eight months and I'm going 
to have to explain all this!
	and make Mihoshi thinks she's interrupting anything.)
"Be- because it's <sob>, it's <sob>, it's MY BIRTHDAY!!  
WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
Xavier: ([IDEA!!!!])

	As the door opened, Xavier trying to present this as Mihoshi's Birthday 
Dinner, he notice Kiyonne
face and he knew what it meant: HOW THE F*** WAS I SUPPOSE TO KNOW IT WAS 
HER BIRTHDAY?!?!
"Hi Mihoshi!  Sorry about Tenchi, but Kiyonne called ahead so I set all this 
up!"  One could almost hear
the sweat coming off his head.  Kiyonne was so confused she couldn't even 
close her mouth.  Things were
	working out for Xavier.
"Huh?"  were the only words Mihoshi could form.
"We didn't have the things here to make your favorite dish, and I was 
already half way through making
	Kiyonnes favorite before I thought about getting take-out. Ha ha (hands 
moving back and forth
	along the back of his head and neck).
"But you only set out two plates; and why did you put out all these 
candles?"  Mihoshi quickly pointed out.
	Kiyonne is still trying to grasp the situation.
"Oh, umm, I'm about to go pick up your cake... and I... I couldn't remember 
how old you were!"
"But..." Mihoshi started.
"You two had better start eating before it gets cold."  Kiyonne barely 
realized that Xavier had seated her.
"I should probably call to make sure your cake is ready."  He went in the 
other room and prepared to talk loudly.

"Hello, Tokyo Bakery!"
"YES I NEED TO CHECK ON AN ORDER FOR XAVIER!"
"Sir?"
"THAT'S RIGHT... X-A-V-I-E-R."
<typing>
"NOW I CALLED ABOUT AN HOUR AGO TO ORDER A LARGE CAKE FOR MIHOSHI. 
M-I-H-O-S-H-I!"
"What kind of cake was it?"
"NO.  THAT WAS A CHOCOLATE CAKE."
"Umm, any particular design you wanted?"
"IT WAS FOR AN OFFICER*white icing with blue trims, happy birthday Mihoshi 
in red* UH-HUH."
"Alright."
"WILL THAT STILL BE READY IN FIFTEEN MINUTES?"
"...Sir it will take at least a half hour to..."
"HOW MUCH WAS THAT BY THE WAY?"
"Twenty-five dollars, but it will be at least half an..."
"FIFTY DOLLARS!  THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD WHEN I CALLED EARLIER!  I'M 
COMING DOWN TO TALK WITH A MANAGER!"
	With that he hung up.

"I'll be right back with your cake Mihoshi!" he called back as both Kiyonne 
and Mihoshi stared at him with
	disbelief.


	He barely heard the snickering coming from the bakery as he ran back to the 
apartment.  He barely
noticed the rain until it really started to come down and by then he was 
back to the apartment.
"Perfect.  Just perfect." he thought to himself as he tried to dry off in 
the hallway.

	When he re-entered, he noticed immediately that Kiyonne had calmed down 
considerably and that Mihoshi
had blown out exactly twenty-six of the candles.
"They found your cake and it shouldn't be to wet..."
"YAY!!"
Mihoshi kissed Xavier on the cheek and took about a quarter of the cake on 
her plate.
While dumbfounded his attention was soon drawn back to Kiyonne.
"Dinner was lovely Xavier, thank you."  She was blushing a little and looked 
more seductive than ever.
As he went in to kiss her, he was quickly halted by Mihoshi's question.
"So do I get to open my presents now?"

Kiyonne looked at Xavier with question.  The only thinks around that were in 
any kind of container
were the chocolates and the necklace he intended to give Kiyonne.

Kiyonne found them and walked over to Mihoshi.

Kiyonne first handed her the chocolates saying, "This is from Xavier."

"Yay!(high-pitched)" she said while taking one.

Kiyonne then handed her the necklace, expecting it to be a gold plated 
necklace with a locket attached,
"This is from... me?"  Xavier turned completly red as Mihoshi took the pearl 
necklace.

"OH THANK YOU KIYONNE! I KNEW YOU LIKED ME! I'LL TREASURE THIS FOREVER!"

Kiyonne was quite white now, due to shock and the lack of oxygen that was 
caused by Mihoshi hug
"You'.. you're welcome... Mihoshi."

	Most of the night was spent in silence (except for Mihoshis' admiration for 
Kiyonne for having
giving her the necklace), Xavier, Kiyonne, and Mihoshi quickly finished the 
bottle of wine, and shortly
there after, Kiyonne helped a very drunk Mihoshi to bed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After Mihoshi and Kiyonne had gone to bed, Xavier practically collapsed on 
his futon, his head raced
	as he went through the events of the evening.

"After all that planning and waiting..."
"What must Kiyonne think of me?..."
"At least Mihoshi had a good evening...."

	His hair was now in his face so it was hard for him to tell that Kiyonne 
had come out of the bedroom.
That and the rain had become very loud in the silence. She had snuck up on 
him so that he was unaware of her
until she sat down beside him.  He quickly sat up.

"Kiyonne, I..." Xavier began.
"Shhhhhhhhh......" her finger was against his lips.  "I was ready to find 
anyway out of this system
	until you came along..."  Xavier was still dumbfounded but attentive.  
"Thank you for this
	evening, I found out you are a great cook, very romantic; you've made 
Mihoshi much calmer,
	and I even got some of those chocolates." She gave a short, low laugh.

"Oh, and I love you as well..."  With that they kissed.

	That night Xavier and Kiyonne fell asleep in each others arms.
