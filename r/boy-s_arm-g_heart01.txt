Episode1- The Boy With a Strong Arm and a Good Heart

My first fan-fic.  It's kinda short, features a new character, hope to 
make more of them, and is (I think) not half bad.

 

 

 

 

                Tenchi Muyo is a product of AIC or Pioneer and I do not 
own any of these characters.  They are copywrited by Pioneer or AIC so 
if
neither one of these companies own the characters please don't sue me 
and I'm broke anyway, actually my entire family isn't doing
so well so sorry if I offend any of these companies.

 

            This is my first time writing a fan fic so it may not be 
that good so please e-mail me with any comments on how I could change 
it.  I hope
to make a small series starting with this story.  This episode will 
feature a new character and will make a DBZ crossover later in the 
stories. I
probably have to say that DBZ is a property of Funimation and they own 
it and it is copywrited by them (blah blah blah...).  Anyway, I hope 
you
enjoy it, oh, a couple more things.  This is based off the OVA, meaning 
no Kiyone (yet), all the girls have the hots for him, and the plot is 
going to
jump around a bit so read well.

 

                                                ********************

 

It is a hot day in Japan, especially in Okayama.  At the Masaki house, 
Tenchi's out in the field  working.  His sweat is coming by the tons as
he takes the hoe and starts digging into the ground.  Ryoko is tanning 
on the roof with a bikini on and sunglasses.  Ayeka is hanging clothes 
on
the clothesline, she is also sweating profusely.  Sasami is sitting on 
the porch having a glass of ice tea and next to her is Mihoshi who is, 
yep
you guessed it, sleeping.  About that time Ayeka was about to burst.

 

"Ugh, what is with it with you and Ryoko?" Ayeka says, "all you do is 
sleep and eat, you don't help around the house nearly as
much as Sasami and me do."

 

Mihoshi is still asleep.

 

She mumbles "Forget it," and looks up at the roof at Ryoko "how about 
you?  Are you going to do anything?"

 

Ryoko just lies there.

 

"Well?"

 

Ryoko then flips over and unbuttons the bikini top.

 

"You ingrate, how dare you turn your back to me!  You know, I don't 
even see a reason for Lord Tenchi to keep you around."

 

This arouses Ryoko and she puts her top back on and comes down to the 
ground.

 

"For your information, Tenchi *keeps* me around because he's waiting 
for the right time to take me into his heart, and his room."

 

"His room?  As I recall, you go into his room without his permission 
anyway, which makes him mad and will put me at the top, although I was
already at the top."

 

Ryoko growls at this remark and stares a hole through Ayeka.

 

"Mmmmm..." Mihoshi moans.

 

Sasami looks at her and says, "I wonder what she's dreaming of?"

 

"I can answer that question for you Sasami."

 

"Oh, Washu, it's you, good morning.  We haven't seen you for the past 
few days?"

 

"I had a lot of research to do, in fact, it deals with your question 
there.  It's a machine that can receive images the mind gives off while 
in
the sleep form.  Actually, that took me a couple hours, after I was 
done with that, the satellite I sent out a couple weeks ago picked up 
two
extremely large power sources coming this way at a several thousand 
miles a minute.  So we're going to have some visitors in a couple
days.  Anyway lets see what happens in that head of hers."  

 

[Cut away scene]

 

Ryoko is in her regular clothes now and Mihoshi is still asleep except 
she has wires coming from every part of her head and looks like a super
computer with a woman's body.  In front of her is a large TV screen 
with the 'snow' flying all over the place and Washu is tapping at
her transparent computer.

 

"Well, this is harder than I thought, Mihoshi's mind is so, well, 
Mihoshi so it's a lot harder to tap into her thoughts so...oh wait a
minute, here we go."

 

She pushes a button and the screen turns on.

 

[Camera faces the girl's face, back of screen is in front of us]

 

"Now, this is just a prototype, so we won't be getting any sound," 
Washu says.

 

The girls just sit and watch the screen, and there eyes get wider, and 
wider, and wider, soon Ayeka puts her hand over Sasami's eyes and
Ryoko's starts to shake.

 

"Well, um...ooh," Washu says.

 

Ryoko bursts.

 

She punches the TV which explodes, Mihoshi's still asleep.  

 

"Hey, my invention!"

 

Ryoko then jumps on top of Mihoshi and starts to shake her by the 
straps of her shirt, Mihoshi wakes up real silently, like she heard a 
quiet
alarm.

 

"Ryoko, what's up, I was just having a nice dream."

 

"Nice...dream...you had a...nice...dream," Ryoko is too angry to yell 
at her.

 

"Yeah, do you want to hear about it."

 

"Hear...about...it?"

 

Washu mumbles, "Hear it, we saw it."

 

"Is that what you dream about when you sleep Mihoshi?!" Ayeka yells.

 

"Um...I think so...can you read my mind or something?"

 

Ryoko is able to yell now, "Do you know what I'm going to do to you you 
little..." she is interrupted by Tenchi's voice.

 

"Hey, hey, hey, what's going on over there?"

 

"Lord Tenchi, Mihoshi is traumatizing poor Sasami's mind 
with...with...I can't even say it," Ayeka yells.

 

"Ayeka, we had no idea what we were going to see, it's not Mihoshi's 
fault," Sasami tells Ayeka.

 

"Even still, she shouldn't be dreaming about that, it's very degrading 
to anyone in it," Ayeka argues back.

 

"What was your dream Mihoshi," Tenchi asks kindly.

 

"Um...um, um, I...need to go...take a bath, bye," and she runs into the 
house and up the stairs.

 

[Sweat on Tenchi]

 

"What was that all about," Tenchi asks with a confused look. He then 
feels the cluthching hands of Ryoko around his chest.

 

"Don't worry about it, c'mon, let's go have a drink," she drags Tenchi 
into the house.

 

"Well you're not going to have a drink with Lord Tenchi alone," Ayeka 
shouts and follows them.

 

Sasami giggles and says, "I'll start dinner," and goes into the house.

 

********************************************************************

 

 

It's dinner and everyone, including Katsuhito and Noboyouki [I think 
that's how you spell his name] are sitting at the table having a big
bowl of noodles in the middle.

 

"So Washu, what were you talking about having some visitors coming 
over," Sasami asks.

 

"Well, you don't know this yet, but several weeks ago I launched a 
satellite into the solar system that can pick up the motion of any 
ships
and give it's speed and proximity when it's going to reach the Earth, 
at least I think that's where it's heading."

 

Mihoshi reaches in for some more noodles.

 

"But why would someone want to come to Earth," Tenchi asks.

 

"Maybe it's father, you saw him before he left last time he was here, 
he wasn't very happy," Ayeka says.

 

"I don't think so, this ship was smaller, but I noticed several large 
guns coming out of the exterior of the ship, so I don't think it's
friendly, whatever it is," Washu exclaims.

 

"Maybe it's my grandfather's ship, I got a call from him saying he 
wanted to stop by and see how I was doing," Mihoshi says.

 

"Yes, but you got that call from him this morning, and not even GP 
ships travel that fast, so I'm going to be on guard," Ryoko says,
slurping some noodles at the same time.

 

"Anyway, they won't be here for a couple days so we don't have to..." 
Washu is cut off by the sound of a ship landing the lake.

 

"Looks like your calculations are a little off, Tenchi, go get the 
Tenchi-ken," Ryoko demands.  Tenchi nods and runs up to his room.

 

Everyone runs out to see a huge, black ship with two scythes coming out 
of the top of the ship.  

 

Tenchi gets out to see the ship and almost passes out.

 

"It's, it's huge," Tenchi exclaims.

 

Everyone is on guard when the door of the ship opens and steps out a  
really small, long-haired male steps out and looks down at them, all of 
the
girls fear is shattered by laughter by the sight of the little man, he 
isn't amused.

 

"Bow down people of Earth, to your new leader," he yells.

 

Tenchi and the girls fall down with hysterical laughter.

 

"Leader of Earth," Washu says, mixed in with laughter.

 

"Oh, I'm so terrified," Ayeka says sarcastically, which makes everyone 
laugh harder.

 

"No lets be serious," Ryoko says with tears in her eyes, "although we 
should defend ourselves and it's not a fair fight when we
(chuckles) loom over him, so Rio-Ohki, go get him, you're his size," 
with that everyone falls to the ground laughing even harder.

 

The mans face is red with fury.

 

The groups laughter is shattered by the sound of a gun being fired and 
a big explosion erupts in the middle of them, turning them charcoal 
black
and eyes bulging.  The man is chuckling as he holds a gun bigger than 
him in his hands with smoke curling off the end.

 

Everyone is brushing themselves off when Ryoko yells, "You bastard," 
and shoots a energy ball out of her hand.  The ball explodes only to
leave the man unscathed with a shield around him.

 

"Hmmm, an energy manipulator," he says and a small wire comes out with 
a green glass and puts it over his eyes.

 

"Hmmm, power's pretty high, but not high enough for him," the machine 
beeps and he turns his head to Tenchi and Sasami,
"jurai power, from an earthling?  Wait a minute, that's the princess 
Sasami.  Hmmm...I hypothesize that this lad could be a relative of
hers," he smiles and says to himself, "This could be a chance to have 
some fun."

 

"You peons down there, I invite you into my ship for a game of, well, 
lets just leave it at that," he turns into the ship, "computer, set his
power to maximum, I might need it all."

 

A seductive female voice is heard "Yes sir, I'll get right to it," and 
he walks into the ship.

 

"What was that all about," Tenchi thinks as a beam comes from the top 
of the ship and the group is transported into the ship.

 

Katsuhito looks at Nobooyouki as he watches them, "Don't worry, they'll 
be all right."

 

"Yeah, you're right, after all, Tenchi does have the Light Hawk Wings."

 

Katsuhito shakes his head, "No, that's not what I mean.  Come with me."

 

****************************************************************

 

 

Inside the ship, everyone except Sasami and Washu are in there battle 
uniforms and are in a dark room.

 

"What, how did we get into these clothes," Tenchi says.

 

"He was probably able to tap into a section of our mind and probably 
found out about these clothes," Washu exclaims.

 

The lights come on and the short man is seen strapped to dozens of 
wires that are connected to a large box with a weird figure that looks 
like a
person with there arms folded on the outside.  

 

The wires release him and he opens his eyes to see them.

 

"Thanks to my wonderful machine, I was able to look into all of your 
minds, very clever hypothesis Washu."

 

"Wait...do you know him Washu?" Mihoshi asks.  Everyone face-faults.

 

"Just stand there and look like you understand something, okay 
Mihoshi," Washu says.

 

"Okay."

 

The man puts his face in his hands, "Anyway, I wanted you on board so I 
could test your powers.  I got some quite interesting readings while
looking into your mind.  So, who wants to be first."

 

"I'll gladly volunteer," and Ryoko charges at him and delivers a good 
punch in the face, which he just stands there like nothing
happened.

 

"What, that was my strongest punch, how can he just take it like that.  
Okay here's round two," and she lifts her other arm up but
before she delivers he punches her in the stomach and she cringes with 
pain.

 

"I didn't even see him throw it, how can someone his size move so 
fast," and without looking at her, he kicks her in the face which
sends her crashing into the wall.

 

"Ryoko," Tenchi screamed, and activated Tenchi-ken and charged at the 
man.  He just jumped out of his way, grabbed Tenchi by the
arm, and threw him into the wall.

 

Washu is furiously typing at her computer when Ayeka screams, "Tenchi!" 
and she charges at him.  The man dodges her punches and
gives one of his own, which sends Ayeka to her knees.

 

"C'mon princess of Jurai, is that the best you can do," he then grabs 
her head and slams it into the floor of the ship and laughs
maniacally.

 

"Wait a minute," Washu looks at a computer that has a metal sphere 
coming from the top, "that computer over there is generating
strong pulse waves, and the waves are directed at him," and she points 
to the man who is throwing Ayeka around and beating the crap out of
her. 

 

"Sasami, stay here, I'll go try to stop those pulse waves," and she 
runs towards the computer.  She stops suddenly when the man is
in front of her with his arms spread out, "You are very smart, Little 
Washu.  However, you'll have to get off your little ego trip, and make
room for the strongest AND smartest genius in the universe," and chops 
her at the neck, she falls down in pain.

 

"Oh, I'm sorry, let me help you up," and kicks her in the stomach that 
sends her across the room.

 

"Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha, hmmm." and he fades out and stops in 
front of Sasami, who was on her way to the computer.

 

"Where do you think you're going?"

 

Sasami, out of a desperate attempt, kicks him in the shin, he still 
stands.

 

"You little brat, just for that, you'll be the first one to go," and he 
forms an energy ball in his hands, and starts his maniacal laughter.

 

"You need a TIME OUT, little girl," and starts laughing again.

 

"Hmmm.I wonder what this button does," (beep) (noises of a machine 
starting up our heard).

 

The man just stands there with a scared look on his face, and turns to 
see Mihoshi looking at the control panel with a puzzled look, energy 
ball
disintegrates.

 

"What, you idiot, do you know what you just did," he forms another 
energy ball but that one quickly disintegrates, which he's
surprised at.

 

"I do," Ryoko flies at him and punches him, which sends him across the 
room.

 

Mihoshi answers the question also, "Of course I know what I did, I 
pressed this button," and presses it again, "or was it that one?"

 

The feminine voice is heard, "Cryogenetic stasis lock is open, reviving 
frozen body from cryogenetic sleep."

 

"No, cancel procedure!  CANCEL!" his face is covered with fear.

 

"Cannot cancel procedure, body is too far out of sleep to restart 
process without restraint," the box with the weird figure opens up and
shows the body of a person, "releasing steam to revive body," and 
that's what it does.

In a scared voice, "Computer, transport me to level nine!  NOW!", and 
he and the rest of the group fade out.

 

**********************************************************************

 

The gang is in a dark room when a light comes on, and the small man is 
seen sweating like crazy and breathing heavily.

 

"You.sons of.bitches.do you know what you just caused?"

 

"I already told you what I did," everyone face-faults.

 

"No you imbecile, you just released the bastard that tried to kill me 
2000 years ago," his breathing slows down, "although, thanks to
my quick timing, we got out of that room without him noticing me.  Now, 
shall we begin again?" a large machine rises from the floor, encasing
him in a glass bubble at the top.  The machine is ten-feet tall, with 
four metal legs coming out of its sides.

 

"Uh-oh."

 

One of the legs crashes to the floor causing Tenchi and the girls to 
scatter.  More attacks by the legs are made as everyone screams and 
tries
to run for cover.

 

"Oh my, this is too much fun."

 

Tenchi runs under the machine and slices at one of the legs, to his and 
the man's surprise, it is cut off.

 

"Nice sword you got there kid," he pushes a button which makes a second 
leg retract out of the hole in the side, which surprises Tenchi
and knocks him to the ground.  Several tentacles come out of the 
machine and restrain him.

 

"But you see kiddo, I am just too smart for you," he turns to the 
girls, "if any one of you try to come at me, I will pump millions of 
volts of
electricity into him, while squeezing him to death!"

 

All the girls look at each other, drop there heads, and puts their 
hands up.

 

"Well, well, I win again," he starts laughing and he continues to 
laugh, making them even louder than the last ones.

 

All of a sudden, a disk flies out and slices off the tentacles, and 
those and Tenchi fall to the ground.  The girls look in amazement as 
they see the
mans face, too scared to even speak.

 

"It.can't.be.I covered up.my tracks.perfectly.how could he.find me.in 
my own ship?" he turns the top of the
machine around to see the figure in the darkness, the figure has his 
palm facing the ship.

 

Ryoko figures this is a good time to get Tenchi, so she flies and picks 
him up and carries him to the group.

 

"You thought you could get away without telling your computer to lock 
all last teleportation figures," the figure says, his voice sounds
annoyed, "Professor Kinay, I thought you were smarter than that," the 
figure steps out, he is tall with pure black hair, a little longer then
Tenchi's, he's looks about as old as Tenchi and his built is very 
muscular.

 

"You.hacked into my computer,"

 

"That's the least of your troubles, I totally destroyed the entire 
system,"

 

"Well, you won't get away this time," the machine throws its leg at 
him.  The boy just stands there and catches its leg.  The machine
struggles to get it free.

 

"You shouldn't play with big toys like this," he fastens a tighter grip 
on it, "You could.TAKE OUT AN EYE WITH IT!" and he
rips the legs machine out of its hinges.  The machine sparks and 
electricity shoots out of the hole, it struggles to stand upright when 
an energy
blast hits the bottom, causing the machine to explode.

 

The smoke is huge when from inside, three blasts are heard, heading 
straight for the boy.  They impact him which explode into a ball of 
fire. 
Kinay comes out of the smoke with a wild look in his eyes and hair 
frizzled with several burn marks.  In his hand is the gun he used 
before.

 

"Die, die, die, DIE, DIE, DIE!" he screams as more shots come from the 
gun.

 

The smoke clears to see the boy with his arms crossed in front of his 
face, unharmed, Kinay is shaking with fear.

 

"What's the matter professor, your gun didn't work, that's too bad," he 
gives a smirk, "Are you scared?  Because you
know my race can sense fear."

 

Kinay just stands there, and his face soon turns from terror to 
laughter.

 

"Of course, your race, how could I forget?  The most vicious in the 
universe, or should I say was," he chuckles.

 

"What's so funny," the boy also chuckles, "going crazy with fear?"

 

Kinay charges the gun up, "No, of course not my silly boy, I just 
forgot that you are a HUGE exception to your race, you're even ashamed
of your race," he points the gun at Sasami, who was separated by the 
rest because of the machine, Sasami looks at him with fear, "If you
don't surrender yourself to me within one minute, I will kill all these 
people one by one, starting with the Juraien Princess," Sasami starts
to cry.

 

A frown is on the boys face, "You don't want to do that."

 

"C'MON NOW, YOU ONLY HAVE THIRTY SECONDS, WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE!"

 

The boy just stands there.

 

"Three...two...one...TIMES UP," the gun takes in energy and releases 
it.

 

"SASAMI...NO," Ayeka screams.

 

The blast explodes which takes out most of the pillar behind it and 
tears the wall up.

 

"HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, HUH?  Hey, where'd you go?" he then realizes 
where he is and slowly turns his head to where the gun
was pointed.

 

The smoke is just clearing when you can see two figures in the smoke.  
Sasami is still whimpering and cowering when she notices that
she's okay.  She looks up to see the boy in front of her, arms wide 
open, and smoke billowing from his chest.  Sasami starts to cry with 
joy.

 

"I told you that you didn't want to do that," he looks at Sasami and 
smiles, "Are you okay princess?"

 

She nods, then passes out.

 

He catches her and sets her against the remainder of the pillar, "Heh 
heh, have a nice sleep," he looks at Kinay and frowns disgustingly,
"Now it's your turn," and fades out.

 

Kinay's face is soaked with fear as the image of a hand punches him in 
the face, he flies across the room.  The boy is standing where Kinay
was and starts walking to where he is now.  Kinay jumps up with a 
crazed look and starts shooting at him.  The energy balls continue 
towards
him but instead of taking them he swats them out of the way.  Kinay 
points the gun at Tenchi.

 

"I ain't going down without someone with me," but when he pulls the 
trigger it just clicks, "WHAT, IT OVERHEATED?!"

 

He throws the gun down and runs to a lever, "NOW NONE OF US WILL ESCAPE 
ALIVE!" but his hand is stopped by a strong force.  He
looks up to see the boy grabbing his arm.  He starts whimpering like 
crazy.

 

The boy looks at him, smiles, and says, "Buh-bye," and throws Kinay in 
the air.  Kinay screams as he tumbles in the air and the boy holds
the palm of his hand out.

"MASENKOOOOO...HYAH," a huge energy beam flies out of his hand and hits 
Kinay.

 

Kinay says in a fading voice, "Damn...you," and vaporizes in the blast.  
The beam continues till it is outside the ship and goes into the
atmosphere.

 

The boy stares at it and a smile forms on his face, and it nearly 
covers his whole face when he screams, "YES, 2000 YEARS FROZEN IN A
CRAMMED BOX CAN'T STOP ME, WHOOO HOOO!" He flies around the room with a 
white glow yelling "I'M FREE, I'M
FREE!" He lands back on the ground, "Ha, I still got my edge (throws a 
couple kicks and punches).  No one can beat me...NO ONE!" 
He stops and freezes when he realizes that everyone else is looking at 
him.

 

His face turns bright red before he regains his composure, "Ah-hem.  
Sorry about that, I haven't moved much for a while so I feel kinda
energetic. Ha ha ha ha."

 

They still stare at him.

 

"Sorry, I didn't give a proper greeting.  My name's Broka."

 

*********************************************************************

 

 

"Boy, that was sure exciting today," Mihoshi states, everyone is eating 
at the table.

 

"Exciting?  It was long, that's what it was," Ryoko argues.

 

"But still, thanks to Broka, we're all safe," Sasami says.

 

"Speaking of which," Ryoko looks over, Broka is there gobbling down 
some vegetables and rice at the same time, "why are you
here?"

 

Broka looks at Ryoko and swallows a big gulp, "Well, like I said, I was 
in cryogenetic sleep for over 2000 years, so my ship that I used to
have is probably scrap heap right now *boy this is good*, anyway I 
would like a place to stay for a while, at least if it's all right with 
you
Tenchi."

 

"Of course, the more the merrier."

 

"That's great (shoves in some rice)!  Sasami, you don't mind cooking 
for an extra person, do you?"

 

"Of course not, I love cooking, one more person living with us won't be 
bad, in fact, I think it's wonderful."

 

Broka smiles and takes a piece of fish.

 

"By the way, Kinay *that was his name, wasn't it* said that your race 
was 'the most vicious in the universe'.  Now I know some
dangerous humanoid races, which one are you from," Washu comments.

 

Broka just shoves in some more food.

 

"Now Washu, you shouldn't ask personal questions like that."

 

Washu looks disgustingly at Tenchi, then smiles and says, "Okay, as 
long as you're still going to be my guinea pig."

 

Broka laughs and chokes on some food, "I think *chough* I'm going to 
have a lot of fun here."

 

Everyone laughs as the sun sets.
