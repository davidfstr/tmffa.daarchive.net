Tenchi Muyo Follow your heart

Chapter one

(After the 13th episode)

        Tenchi is in the fields taking a break from work.  As he sits
under the shade of a nearby tree, he begins to contemplate about the
news he received this morning.  <I  suppose it would be good to have
them back, it's only been a couple of nonths since they visited.  I
don't mind seeing my great grandmother, Lady Funaho.  But it's kind
of different with Lady Misake and Emperor Asuza.  It's not that I
don't like Lady Misake but those hugs of hers leave me bruised and
gasping for air.  I don't know about Emperor Asuza and whe he dislikes
me.  I have done nothing to upset him before except beat that Sergio
guy.  Well I night as well start heading back home and prepare for
their arrival tomorrow. >  As Tenchi begins to stand-up he is shocked
by the familiar sound of one persons voice.
        "Tenchi."
        "Ryoko, what are you doing here?"  asks Tenchi as he turns
around to face her.
        "Sorry to have scared you, but Sasami sent me to inform you that
lunch will be ready in about 30 minutes."
        "What?  Uh...Sorry about that Ryoko."
        "Is something bothering you Tenchi?  You looked as if you were
in a trance when I first called you a few seconds ago."
        "Well, uh..."
        "Come on Tenchi, you can tell me.  You never know, I might be
able to help you."
        "Ok Ryoko.  I was just wondering why the royal family is comming
back.  Also, why is it that the Emperor seems to dislike me."
        "Tenchi, the emperor is afraid that you will take over the throne
one of these days.  Expecially since Ayeka has refused the previous
suiters he has sent for her to meet.  If you would like for him to stop
hating you so much, you should choose me over Ayeka."
        Shaking his head, Tenchi replies "Ryoko, if I do that Misake will
do more that bruise a couple of my ribs."
        "Well the maybe we should just elope.  That way we could beave all
our troubles behind here on earth as we travel thourgh the stars
together.  It would be kind of like having a permanent honeymoon,
wouldn't you agree Tenchi."  As Ryoko said this, she closed her eyes
and dreamt of how it would be like if it really did happen.
        Tenchi's only response was, "I can not do that Ryoko."  Immediately,
Ryoko felt as if he stabbed her in the heart.  As he looked at Ryoko, he
noticed the sad expression on her face caused by his response.  Not
wanting to see her hurt he ads, "Ryoko its not that I would hate to travel
with you.  In fact, I do like the idea of traveling in space, but I do not
wish to hurt either you or Ayeka."
        Ryoko begins to smile as Tenchi says this and holds his arm in a
gentle embrace.  Tenchi begins to feel at ease as she smiles while holding
his arm and resting her head on his shoulder.  After a minute of holding
on to him, Ryoko asks, "Tenchi is it alright if we walk home together, I
promise not to do anything except hold you hand if you let me?"
        "Don't you think Ayeka will get mad if she sees us hollding each
others hand?"  Replies Tenchi, as a sweat drop forms on his head as the
image of Ayeka becoming mad develops within his mind.
        Ryoko answered softly, "I don't want to thing about her right now, I
just want to enjoy a nice leisurely walk with you."
        Surprised by Ryoko's gentle form of affection he looks into her
eyes.
<She looks very beautiful when she smiles.  It's almost as if Ryoko truns
into a different person when she is like this.  It's strange but she
reminds me of some one from a long time ago. >  After reacquiring his
thoughts, Tenchi gives her an answer.  "Ok Ryoko, I'd be honored to walk
home with you."
        Ryoko is in an all time high as her heartbeats faster from hearing
Tenchi's response that tears start running down her face.  Noticing the
tears, Tenchi asks, "Ryoko, why are you crying, are you hurt."
        Shaking her head, she replies.  "No Tenchi, I'm fine it's just that
I'm so happy you did not reject my request.  I'll be fine in a minute."
        Tenchi gently embraces Ryoko as he attempts to help calm her down.
"Do you feel better now, Ryoko?"
        "Y...Yes Tenchi, but if do not get home soon lunch will get cold and
Sasami will be mad at us."
        Tenchi nods his head in response and both start to walk home.

**************************(Back at the house)*************************

        "Ayeka, lunch is almost ready could you please set the table."
Yelled Sasami from the kitchen.
        Ayeka stops looking through her wardrove where she attempted to
find something to wear for tomorrow's arrival.  <Sasami has been spending
too much time with that monster woman, she is even starting to pick some
of her habits.  Where is Ryoko anyway she should be doing that instead of
me.  I'll bet she is still asleep somewhere while we are doing chores.
How in the world Tenchi puts up with that good for nothing-useless
creature is beyond my comprehension.  Well I might as well go down and
help out. >  When she reaches the kitchen, Ayeka sees both Sasami and
Mihoshi busy preparing lunch while Ryo-Oki in humanoid formis holding a
basket of vegetables next to Sasami.  "Sasami, you shouldn't yell like
that it is most undignified.  Besides, why didn't you ask that worthless
Ryoko?  I was busy  preparing for our parents arrival tomorrow."
        Sasami lowers her head as she converses with her sister.  "I'm
sorry Ayeka, but I had already asked Ryoko to inform Tenchi that lunch
would soon be ready."
        "YOU DID WHAT!?  How could you ask that monster to go near my
Tenchi?  She is probably seducing Tenchi right now.  I must go and save
Lord Tenchi from that monster woman."  Ayeka protests as she runs out to
look for Tenchi.
        Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ryo-Oki stare for a few moments at the empty
spot where Ayeka was standing before they resume with the meal
preparation.
        Ayeka stops at the front door when she sees Tenchi in front of her.
"Welcome back Lord Tenchi, I would have gone to...ack!"  This is as far as
Ayeka got when she noticed tha tTenchi and Ryoko were holding hands.
Horrified by the sight in front to her Ayeka could not say another word.
<Has Tenchi chosen Ryoko.  No, this can't be there is no way he could have
picked that monster woman over me. >  Determined to get an answer, Ayeka
shouts, "What is the meaning of this Ryoko!!!  What trick did you use to
seduce Lord Tenchi in order to get him to touch someone like you!"
        "Please Miss Ayeka, it's not what you think."
        "Quiet Tenchi this does not concern you", shapped Ayeka.  Determined
to fight against Ryoko, she would not let anyone get in her way.
        Ryoko slowly let go of Tenchi's hand as Ayeka's false charge of
seducing Tenchi began to upset her.  While still calm, Ryoko replied, "Ok
little princess, what is your problem".  Not able to control her rage any
more, Ayeka bellowed,  "You're the problem you slut!  Everyday you keep
trying to seduce Lord Tenchi with you antics.  I am tired of it all and
I'm goning to show you a lesson you'll soon not forget!"
        As a cocky smile developed of Ryoko's face, she simply replies,  "Is
that so.  If you remember correctly, I brought your precious Juraian Empire
down to its knees last time.  So I doubt you can do any damage to me little
princess."
        In an instant Ayeka's mini logs appeared everywhere.  As with all
their previous fights, Tenchi asks both ladies to stop in the hope they can
resolve the matter differentyly.  Surprisingly to him, Ryoko is th eonly one
to respond to his request with a smile.  "Don't worry Tenchi, I'n not going
to strike at Ayeka unless you want me to."
        Immediately, Ayeka throws several energy balls at Ryoko while
laughing menacingly.  "Take this and this you hussy.  I'll show you to mess
around with my Tenchi."  In the meantime Ryoko is dodging all of Ayeka's
attacks without fighting back.  Once seeing that her attacks were futile,
Ayeka uses a different tactic and calls her guardians into action.  "Azaka,
Kamadakie seize that vile creature!"  Without warning both guardians flank
Ryoko and imprison her in their force field.  Ayeka begins to laugh as she
sees Ryoko struggleing to get out of her grardians forcefield.  Slowly
walking toward Ryoko, Ayeka remarks, "did you think you could have eluded
me forever Ryoko?  It was only a matter of time before I got the better of
you.  And now that I do, I will make you pay for what you have done to Lord
Tenchi.  You Bitch!!!"
        "Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko lunch is ready", announced Sasami.
        "Not now Sasami, I am in the process of teaching this monster a
lesson
in manners!", bellowed Ayeka.  "Now Ryoko, I will teach you how to properly
show respect for a member of the hourse of Jurai and their property.
Observing the look on Ayeka's face, Ryoko notices that she is holding
Tenchi-ken in her hand.  Before she is able to say anytin, Ayeka sams the
hilt of Tenchi-ken onto her chest.  Causing, Ryoko's body to kick wildly as
she screams at the top of her lungs from teh pain inflicted by Tenchi-kens'
energy discharge.
        Tenchi's world slowed down for a second as the sight of Ryoko
kicking
wildly from the pain caused by Tenchi-ken, shocked him.  For a few brief
seconds, he viewed his movements in slow motion as he tried to stop Ayeka.
"NO!!!  Ayeka stop!"  Shouted Tenchi as he ran towards Ayeka and life
resumed
to is normal speed.
        "No Tenchi this has gone on for far to long.  I must do some thing
to
stop it before it goes any further", responded Ayeka as she jabbed Ryoko
with
Tenchi-ken once more.  Tyoko unable to stay conscious, as the pain overtook
her body once more was unable to see Tenchi advance on Ayeka.  She was
barely
able to whisper Tenchi's name before she fell unconscious.
        Tenchi felt a sharp pain with-in his heart an instant before he
grabbed
Ayeka's arm and pulled her away from Ryoko's smoking body.  Remembering the
sensation he once experienced when she was in danger from Dr. Clay, Tenchi
wasted no time in seeing to her safety.  "AZAKA, KAMADAKIE TAKE RYOKO TO
WASHU'S LAB NOW!!!"  Bellowed Tenchi as he took Tenchi-ken from Ayeka's
hands.  Once seeing Ryoko's limp form being carried by the guardians, Sasami
began to cry as she followed them into Washu's lab with Mishoshi walking
next
to her.
        "Ayeka, why did you do this?  This incident could have been avoided
if
you had given me a chance to explain the situation.  But as usual, both you
and Ryoko fight with no thought of wht might happen to either of you or
anyone
else.  For what, just to see which one of you can claim me as their suitor."
        "I...I'm sorry Tenchi."
        "Ayeka, you should be saying that to Ryoko not me."
        "Why should I!  She is the cause of all this mess.  If she had not
tried
to seduce you every time she is near you, I would not have acted as I did."
        "Ayeka...Ryoko did not seduce me as you claim.  She asked me if I
would
grant her permission to hold my hand while we walked home.  And I said yes."
        Instantly, Ayeka stares back shocked by Tenchi's response.  Then she
slowly begins looking down as she slowly replies.  "S...So, you have chosen
Ryoko."  Then lifting her head, she screams.  "Why Tenchi!  Why!  She...she
doesn't love you as I do!  A creature like her does not know the meaning of
love nor could she be able to express it with someone.  Can't you see that
she will only use you for now and leave you when she is through with you!"
        "Stop it Ayeka!!!"
        Closing his eyes, Tenchi continues to say.  "I'm sorry for my
behavior
right now Ayeka.  I...I just wish the both of you could settle your
differences peacefully and become friends.  Before something like this
happens
again and I lose one of you.  Both of you are special to me, in your own
ways.
That is why I can not bear to see either of you hurt yourselves.  I will
make
a decision someday but not right now."  With that said, Tenchi walks back
into
the house to check on Ryoko.

********************************(Washu's Lab)*******************************

        "She's fine Tenchi.  There was no serious damage done to her,
especially
that which the greatest scientific genius in the Universe can not fix."  < I
hope he belives this lie.  I don't want to tell him that I almost lost her a
couple of times.  Its a good thing that there are only a couple of ways in
which
Ryoko can be destroyed.  Although most ot those methods will work only if
Ryoko
is willing to let them prevail.>
        Being relived by Washu's response Tenchi asks, "Can I see her?"
        Seeing both the pain an relief with-in Tenchi's eyes, Washu nods her
head.
"She's resting at the moment but I'm pretty sure she would want you to be
near
her."
        "Thank you Washu-chan."

******************************(Ryoko's dream)******************************

        As Ryoko rests within Washu's lab recovering from her injuries she
begins
to have a dream, which has constantly plagued her over the past few nights.
 It
is one where she is finally able to speak with Tenchi privately, but the
mood
is not a happy one.  "Why is it that you fear me Tenchi?  When I first saw
you
I could feel there was something special about you.   But I would never have
thought it possible for me to have these types of feeling for someone, let
alone
express them.  But every time I'd see you go near the cave where I was
imprisoned, my soul would be filled with happiness.  Even though you never
noticed me, I was always there admiring you from a distance.  I was happy
with
this until it all changed.  The first time you meet me, I frightened you off
with my appearance.  And the second time it was my actions, which frightened
you even further away from me.  At the time, I wanted to express both my
emotions and actions in a way,which I felt was right.  I can not forget
those
days because they represent the time my world went into ciaos once more.  I
wish I could change the past, because you only see me now as a monster that
might hurt you.  Even thought there are times I want to leave so as to ease
the
pain I seem to inflict on you, I can not.  That is because I want to make
sure
you're safe at all times.  Tenchi, I will do everything and anything in
order
to protect you, but please don't leave me alone."  As Tenchi turns around he
begins to fade away from her.  "Don't leave me Tenchiiiii!", screams Ryoko,
as
she desperately tries to grab a hold of him before he is gone.
        Ryoko wakes up slowly not wanting to see if her dream came true.  At
first confused by her surroundings, Ryoko looks around and notices that
she's
inside Washu's lab.  Being relived she is not someplace unknown to her, she
checks to see if there are any restraints on her.  Once she is satisfied
there
is nothing holding her back she teleports herself out to the living room.

*****************************(Tenchi's room)********************************

        Tenchi is unable to sleep due to the constant reminder of Ryoko and
Ayeka's battle in the afternoon.  To his recollection this was the first
time
that Ryoko did not fight back in her usual manner.  This was a big surprise
to him since he had asked both girls not to fight during most of their
previous
battles and Ryoko was the only one to comply with his request this time.
<Why
did I not stop them from the beginning when I had the chance?  It is because
of me that Ryoko got injured today.  I should never have let this happen. >
        After several long minutes of replaying the day's events in his
mind.
Tenchi dedides to head for the kitchen and get a snack.  While he is
descending
the stairwell he notices that the front door is slightly open.  As he
approachesthe door in order to close it he begins to hear the faint sound of
music coming from outside.  As he looks outside, he sees a figure, which
appears
to be dancing by itself on the dock.  After a little bit of time he is able
to
tell it is Ryoko.  While he walks towards her, he begins to remember where
he
had first heard this particular musical piece.  <I believe, I've heard this
one before in my physical education class a couple of years ago.  Our
professor
was showing us some form of dance called a waltz.  If I'm not mistaken this
is
the Waltz from 'The Sleeping Beauty' by Tchaikovsky. >  Mesmerized by both
the
music and Ryoko's dancing ability, Tenchi could only look at her and smile
as
he walked towards her.
        When the music stopped playing, Tyoko was shocked to see Tenchi
looking
at her.  Causing her to instantly turn several shades of red, as she became
embarrassed to be seen by him in such a manner.  Noticing her blushing
reaction, Tenchi slowly responds.  "I...I'm sorry if I scared you Ryoko, I
did not mean to interrupt you.  But I do want to apologize for my lack of
behavior today."
        Instantly Ryoko replies, "What do you mean Tenchi?"
        "I mean the fight between you and Ayeka."
        "Oh.  You mean that, its ok Tenchi both Ayeka and I are used to
these
types of arguments."
        "Its not alright.  I should have stoped Ayeka before the argument
escalated and told her that you did nothing wrong.  You never seduced me
into holding your hand, you asked me for my permission.  Ryoko, you know
that I have never interfered in your arguments even when she start to
insult you.  I'm sorry that such things have happened before, but I'll
try to make sure that it does not happen around here anymore.  You are
a guest in my family's house and when I allow her or anyone to treat you
in such a manner it brings shame to both my family and myself."
        "Thank you Tenchi.  I'll try to kelp out around the house more so
you won't think I'm freeloading on your account."
        "Ryoko that would be nice but all I want is for you and Ayeka to
work
out whatever problems you might have had and become friends."
        "Ok Tenchi.  I'll do as you ask, but only because I love you so much
that I will do whatever it takes to make you happy."
        "Thank you Ryoko, this means alot to me."
        With a smile on her face, Ryoko leans forward and whispers softly
into his ear.  "Tenchi.  I also have a favor to ask of you."
        By reaction, he jumps back from her, making her expression turn from
cheerful toward one of misery.  Immediately seeing her facial
characteristics
change, Tenchi scolds himself.  <Why did I have to hurt her again after all
I
said?  She has never done anything to hurt me.  Even when she was playing
around with me at school after I released her from the cave.  Sure she
scarred the crap out of me but she never came close to harming me.  Since
then she has gone out of her way to show me how much she loves and cares for
me.  Even though I'm not yet comfortable having so much attention flaunted
on
me by one single person.  I have to make this up to her and make sure it
never
happens again.  Its time for some changes around here and I might as well
start now.>  "I'm sorry about that Ryoko.  Old habits are hard to bread but
I'll work on it, I promise."
        With a smile on her face once more, she replies.  "Yes you do have
to
work on that Tenchi.  But I have one thing to say.  I'm tired of dancing by
myself.  Would you like to dance with me?  I've been practicing for some
time now so I won't step on your feet like I did last time when you
practiced
by the cave."
        Tenchi simply bows and responds, "It would be my pleasure to dance
with
you Ryoko."  As he extends his hand you to her, she does a curtsy in reply.
As they both walk to the middle of the dock, Johann Strauss', 'The Blue
Danube'
begins to play.  They begin the waltz with a simple box step.  As the music
progressed so did their moves.  It wasn't long before Ryoko, was being
twirled
around by Tenchi and moving into more advanced steps.  Their moves were
flawless as they glided through the dock with such ease that it would make
any
ball room dance instructor proud to have them as students.  Half way through
the music Ryoko began to levitate both Tenchi and herself a few inches off
the
dock.  Tenchi did not mind this since it helped their movement's flow
better.
Then, with Tenchi's approval she proceeded to levitate them onto the surface
of the lake.  As they neared the middle, the lake surface reflected the
stars
in the sky like a mirror.  As the beauty of the atmosphere surrounded them,
both Tenchi and Ryoko began to lose themselves in thought.  <Tenchi it this
a dream?  Are you really with me at this moment?  If this is a dream, I
never
want to wake-up unless I am in your arms like this.  And if this is for
real,
I want to treasure this moment forever.>  <She looks so beautiful,  her
eyes,
I love the way her eyes look when the moonlight shines within them.  It's
almost as if I could see within her and read her thoughts.  I can't imagine
what I would do if I were to have lost her today.  Wait a minute, Ryoko said
she danced with me before.  The only times I ever dance were in gym class
and
once by the cave...Ryoko's cave.  So it was her?  She was the one that would
always make me feel safe and at ease when I was by the cave all those years.
I never thought of her as a demon when I was a kid.  She was more like a
friend
all those years I played by her cave.  But now, she is more than a friend to
me, in fact I...I>  Looking into Ryoko's eyes, Tenchi moves closer to her
and
simply says, "I love you Ryoko".  Ryoko does not get a chance to respond as
Tenchi caresses her face with his right hand as he moves in closer and
kisses
her.  When he finally pulls away, Ryoko replies, "I love you too, my
Tenchi".
They both hold on to each other with a gentle embrace as they look into each
other's eyes and begin to kiss once more as the music finishes.

*********************************(Washu's lab)******************************

        Washu'chan looks into the computer screen with tears on her face.
"Good
luck to both of you.  I'm glad you were finally able to find the love you
had
for each other and express it.  Now the interesting part will be to see how
Ayeka and the Jurian nobility handle this new situation."
