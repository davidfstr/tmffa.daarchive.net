Tenchi started towards the door. 
"Lord Tenchi, where are you going?" Ayeka inquired. 
"I'm going to find Ryoko!" Tenchi yelled. 
"Then we're going with you!" Keone said.
"Yeah it's dangerous out there! I mean what if a giant monster comes like on 
space police policemen!" Mihoshi wined. Keone slapped Mihoshi in the 
back of her head. 
"You dimwit!" 
"Ouch Keone that hurt," Mihoshi started to cry.
"Tenchi" Keone started until she looked and saw that Tenchi was already 
gone. " Now look what you've done Mihoshi! I'm so exasperated I can't 
even speak!" "Well, what are you wanting for? Let's go!" Washu shouted as 
she ran out the door. Everyone followed, except Ayeka. ~I can't believe it. I 
mean normally I wouldn't care. I'd be looking right along with them, but 
something is different. Why does Tenchi care so much it's only Ryoko? This 
happens all the time and she always comes back hmm~

********************

"Hmm, so he has already chosen. Well, there's no need for me to get all 
wound up. Ayeka won fair and square. I mean it wasn't like he was going to 
choose me anyway, I don't care at all," Ryoko said brushing a tear away 
from her cheek, "who am I fooling? Of course I care! It was suppose me! 
Tenchi was supposed to choose me! I'm leaving! I don't have to stand for 
this. Tenchi won't miss me anyhow so it won't matter!" Ryoko flew out of 
the tree and headed back towards the house to get Ryo-okki.

*************************

" Where are you all going? What's the rush and where's Ayeka?" Sasami 
said watching everybody fly past. No one even looked at Sasami they just 
kept going. Sasami looked down at the two year old, Mayuka "come on 
Mayuka lets go see what all the commotion is about," 
"Otay," Mayuka said hopping off the couch.

*************************

"Ryoko! Ryoko I'm sorry!" Tenchi called out. Tenchi felt a drop of water on 
his fore head and looked up. "Ryoko!" Tenchi said happily. Ryoko looked 
down and saw Tenchi smiling. ~ He's happy that I'm leaving~  
This made Ryoko cry even harder. Ryoko closed her eyes and began to fly 
faster. All of the sudden she felt a sharp pain go through her side and 
crashed into a nearby tree. The next thing she knew she was back in 
Washu's lab. Ryoko tried to sit up but a pain in her side caused her to fall 
back down. Tenchi looked over at Ryoko. Ryoko screamed then fainted 
from all the pain. Washu ran over to take a look at her. "Is she going to be 
alright little Washu?" Tenchi turned to Washu. "I don't know Tenchi. She's 
in bad shape!" Washu said as she began typing frantically on her holo 
computer. Tenchi turned back to Ryoko and grabbed Ryoko's hand. ~Hang 
in there~ 

**************************
"Don't ever scare me like that again! Sasami what were you thinking going 
out there like that! You could have been killed!" Ayeka said throwing her 
hands in the air.
"I'm sorry Ayeka I only wanted to help," Sasami answered in a low voice 
starring at the ground.
"We can talk about this more tomorrow, but right now we should just get 
some rest. Then you can come with me in the morning to visit Ryoko if you 
like." Ayeka said in her normal voice.
"Alright." *sigh* ~I'm gonna go and check on the others first! Right after 
she goes to sleep. Sasami gave Ayeka a warm smile, then climbed into her 
pallet on the floor.

**************************

Mihoshi looked down at the floor, "Keone what just happened today?" 
Mihoshi wined.
"Just get some sleep and we can talk about it in the morning," Keone 
groaned.
"But Keone."
"Yeah, what is it Mihoshi? What do you want?" Keone said obviously 
getting angry.
"I'm not tired" Mihoshi responded twirling her fingers around. Keone 
growled.
"You mean to tell me that after all this you're not tired!" Keone yelled 
jumping out of the bed. Keone suddenly heard a loud sound coming from 
inside the room. It kept getting louder and louder. Keone looked around the 
room, then down at her feet. *Sigh* "it's only Mihoshi snoring," she said 
with relief *sweat drop* "well I'd get some sleep." Keone said getting back 
into bed.

***************************

"I've got great news Tenchi!" Washu said running over to Tenchi.
"Yes little Washu, what is it?" Tenchi said looking at her as if she were 
crazy. ~How could she be happy when her daughter is in the condition she's 
in~
"Hey, why are you looking at me like that?"
"How could you be happy at a time like this"
"Because, Ryoko's wound isn't as bad as I thought it was she should heal 
real soon. Now go get some sleep Tenchi, she'll be alright." Washu assured 
him.
"Ok but um how long will it take for her to heal?"
"Oh, I'd say about 500years," 
"What!!!! 500 years!!! Are you serious?" Tenchi said jumping out of his 
skin.
"Of course not Tenchi! Calm down, I was only joking now go get some 
sleep"
"Ok goodnight Washu!" Tenchi called out as he left the lab.
"Hey Tenchi, why don't you sleep with me tonight?" Washu said trying to 
sound innocent. Tenchi flinched, then stopped dead in his tracks. He turned 
around and gave Washu the same crazy look from before,  
"Washu!"
"What? It was only a suggestion," Washu said looking disappointed, 
"goodnight Tenchi," Tenchi smiled and walked out the door.
 
I do not own any of the Tenchi Muyo characters only the idea. I am not 
making any money off of this story.

  Ok so it was a little short. I'll try to write more the next chapter. So what do 
you think? The first chapter was better in my opinion. Here are some 
comments and suggestions for the last chapter.

Hi i read your story and i thought it was great. I really like the nightmare Tenchi was having it showed that 
Kiyone really does like Mihoshi as a partner. If you decide to continue with the story please continue with 
the dream also. I was thinking where was Ayeka and Washu. Maybe you could do something like that but 
thats just a thought. Anyway it was a great story you are a very good writer. Please do continue with the 
story.
