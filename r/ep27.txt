^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EPISODE 27: NO NEED FOR BOUNTIES!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CUE MUSIC: "Flash Back"
SCENE: Early Morning (ohiyo!) on the roof of the Masaki House.
Ryoko and Ryo-oki.
RYOKO: Isn't it great Ryo-oki? What a month this has been. We
defeated Kagato, saved Tenchi's
mother, and Aeka granted us a pardon only after Tenchi asked her
to. This sun rise makes it all just perfect.
RYO-OKI: Miya?
RYOKO: What are you talking about? Look at the way the sun
reflects of those big grey clouds. And  smell that air.  What
could be wrong.
RYO-OKI: MIYA! (Ryo-oki runs inside)
RYOKO: Fine. Go play with Sasami. See if I care. I don't know
what you think could possibly go--
SFX: Really lound Thunderclap, rain starts to fall in a downpour. 
RYOKO: ...wrong? I hate the weather on this rock!
SCENE: The Kitchen. Sasami and Noboyuki are preparing breakfast.
NOBO: So Sasami, what are we fixing for breakfast this morning?
SASAMI: I thought I'd try and American breakfast this morning.
You know! French toast, Belgian waffles, Canadian bacon, English
muffins, and German pork sausages! Dosen't that sound yummy?
NOBO: Uh, Sasami? You..uh..do know that...uh..
TENCHI: APRIL FOOLS!!! (Tenchi steps through the doorway
laughing)  Ha! I finally got you first first, dad! Thanks for
your help Sasami. American breakfast! HA!
SASAMI: (pointing at Tenchi and giggling)
TENCHI: What the? (looking in the mirror that Noboykui just
happened to have with him. His hair is orange, his skin be blue
and his lips are green)
NOBO: Remember son. Old age and tretchery will always overcome
youth and speed! Thank Washu when you see her this morning!
TENCHI: I knew I should've gone through my morning routine this
morning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Outside of the Masaki Shrine. Ken-oki is sitting out side.
Inside Nagi is Talking with Yosho.
YOSHO: So you've come all this way to fight Ryoko again. I admire
your persistence.
NAGI: Thanks.
YOSHO: No, thank you. From what I've heard you played a major
part in helping to defeat Kagato.
NAGI: I only did it so that nobody would kill Ryoko be fore we've
had a chance to fight.
YOSHO: I see. And might I say, you look great in a swimsuit.
NAGI:WHAT?!!
(Ryoko comes running through the door)
RYOKO: Watch out Yosho! Washu is pulling practical jokes out left
and right. She released a sudden rainstorm on me, turned Tenchi
blue, made Aeka belch every time she says "Lord Tench" and the
most deavious one of all--she gave Mihoshi a card that says "How
do you keep a bubblehead in suspense?   Turn card over." on both
sides
and--(gasp) NAGI!
NAGI: Hello Ryoko.
RYOKO: So that Ken-oki outside isn't just another joke, huh?
NAGI: Fraid not, Ryoko. Are you ready to settle this.
RYOKO: No problem! I'm ready if you are. Let's do it!
YOSHO:Now, now ladies. You shouldn't fight on an empty stomache.
Let's have breakfast first. Then we'll settle this matter in an
orderly fasion.
RYOKO: You mean I don't use my powers and she doesn't use her
weapon and we kill each other like two mature women?
YOSHO: Exactly.

SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)

SCENE: Dining room of the Masaki House. Tenchi is flanked by
Ryoko and Aeka, Sasami is next to Kiyone, Mihoshi,Nagi, Washu,
Yosho and a clean shaven Noboyuki.)
SASAMI: More tea, Miss Nagi?
NAGI: Thank you, Princess Sasami. You can just call me Nagi.
SASAMI: And you can just call me Sasami!
NOBO: Hey Washu.  What did you do to my facial hair. I thought we
were in this together.
KIYONE: Oh, come on. I think you look much younger without it.
(she starts snikering at the rest of the gang)
AEKA: That's easy for you to say! She has not gotten to you yet!
Look what she did to Lord Ten--BELCH!!
RYOKO: Looks like princess's got a prob--(rain starts falling on
Ryoko)--lem! Cut it out Washu! How come you haven't gotten Kiyone
yet?
WASHU: She lives with Mihoshi. Everyday is like a practical joke
to her. I though I'd give her the day off. You don't have any
complaints, do you?
ALL: No, Washu.
WASHU: What was that?
ALL: No, LITTLE Washu.
WASHU: That's better.
NAGI: Enough small talk. Are you ready, Ryoko?
RYOKO: Alright! Let's go! Nothing could stop--(more
rain)--GRRRRRRRRRR--KNOCK IT OFF WASHU!
WASHU: You're right of course. I'll stop only if you call me
Little Washu!
RYOKO: Forget it! Let's just get on with this battle!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Outside of the Masaki Shrine. Ryoko and Nagi are at
opposite sides of the courtyard. The rest of the gang
is gathered around watching. Noboyuki is taking bets.
NOBO: I've got Ryoko 5 to 1 to win. Any takers?
TENCHI: DAD! What do you think your doing?
NOBO:All I'm doin' is trying to make some profit out of this.
TENCHI: But someone could get hurt! Aren't you worried?
NOBO: I'm just hoping the clothes will be torn from their bodies!
AEKA: I'd take you up on it but I haven't any currency!
SASAMI: Aeka! What if Ryoko gets hurt?
AEKA: Well then I'll just spend the evening consoling Lord
Ten--BURP! Oh dear.
KIYONE: I'll take you up on that bet, Mr. Masaki!
MIHO: But Kiyone, that's the last of our money!
KIYONE: We can give up Kareoke this week. Don't worry. I know
what I'm doing. Well, Mr. Masaki? I've got Nagi to win.
NOBO: You're on, Kiyone. And stop calling me Mr. Masaki. You can
call me Nobi.
KIYONE: (flirting) Okay, Nobi.
TENCHI: (to himself) Nobi? Isn't that what Mom used to call him?
YOSHO: Since I won't allow killing on my property, you to will
use bokkens to fight with. And when I say "Halt!" and say one of
your names, that person will be decalred the winner. Any
questions?
NAGI: No.
RYOKO: None here!
YOSHO:Then if everyone is ready--FIGHT!!
CUE MUSIC: "Tenchi's Counter Attack!"
( A prolonged fight scene lasting two minutes takes place as
Ryoko and Nagi guard, turn, parry, dodge and spin, in a bokken
fight so spectacular it cannot be described in a low-budget
fanfic such as this, until Nagi slips and falls. Ryoko sets up
for the kill.)
RYOKO: It ends here Nagi!(as she starts running for Nagi to
finish her off, a freak  golfball size hailstone falls from the
sky and strikes Ryoko on the head, knocking her out) 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
FADE TO BLACK
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: Living room. Ryoko is lying on the couch. The gang is
gathered around her.
RYOKO: (groggy) What happened?
WASHU: Well, when I set up  that Hyper-Positive Probiblity
Generation and Manipulation Field around Miss Makibi this morning
it had a geometric effect that caused a piece of solid H2O to
acclerate in a downward trajectory and make positive contact with
your cranium and put you in a state of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep.
Understand.
RYOKO: WHAT?!!
KIYONE: She means my good luck caused an ice chunk to fall
down,go boom into your noggin and send you off to meet Mr.
Sandman.
RYOKO: How could your good luck do that?
KIYONE: Well..I kinda bet against you.
RYOKO: You WHAT?!! How could you betray me like that?
KIYONE: Oh, please. It's not like you're Mihoshi or my brother! 
TENCHI: You lost a lot of blood, Ryoko. You just rest for a
while. You really should thank Nagi. It's a good thing you two
have the same blood type. Washu says it's a 99.99978% match. It's
as if you two were sisters.
NAGI: D-d-don't  b-be ridiculous.(to herself) I think I covered
that pretty well.
RYOKO: That's a laugh! (to herself) I just hope they don't start
beliving it.
NAGI: Well I'm leaving now. See ya'. Let's go Ken-oki!
KEN-OKI: CIAO-CIAO!!
NAGI: Say goodbye to yer friend and let's go!
KEN-OKI: CIAO! Ciao ciao. ciao ciao CIAO ciao ciao-ciao CIAOOOOO!
NAGI: What do you mean she's--
RYO-OKI: Miyaaa!
RYOKO: You mean to tell me there's gonna be more of you little
furballs runnin' around?
RYO-OKI: Miya!
NAGI: Well, Ken-oki refuse to leave his "wife" alone. That means
I'm stuck here for now!
SASAMI: Oh boy! Nagi's staying! Is that alright, Grampa?
YOSHO: Well, If it's no problem for Tenchi....
TENCHI: Oh boy. Another beautiful woman staying at my house. I
know alot of guy who'd kill to get in here.
AEKA: Another beautiful woman? Surely you're not comparing their
beauty to mine, are you Lord Ten-UUURRRRRP!
WASHU: Don't worry, Aeka. It'll wear off at midnight!
AEKA: BUT IT'S 11:30 IN THE MORNING!!!!!!!
RYOKO: To bad! Looks like I'll be spending all day with Tenchi.
(hugging Tenchi) Ne, Tenchi?
AEKA: JUST A MINUTE! YOU UNHAND HIM THIS INSTANT!

CUE NEXT EPISODE MUSIC
TENCHI: In our next episode Kiyone's twin brother arrives on
Earth.
KIYONE:What doing you mean you've been assigned here?
SEION: Wow, Kiyo! You didn't tell me your partner was a babe!
MIHO: Wow, Kiyone! You didn't tell me you brother was so cute!
TENCHI: But when he visits the Masaki shrine, he gets more than
he bargined for.
AEKA: I saw him first!
RYOKO: He's to much of a studmuffin to hang out with a little
girl like you!
YOSHO: Tenchi? is that jelousy in your eyes?
TENCHI: All in our next episode: NO NEED FOR TWIN BROTHERS-- This
guy's to way too good-looking to live here.
SEION: It's unquestionably a great introduction!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Notes:
	1. I got the name Seion from another pronouciation of the
kanji's that spell Kiyone.
 	    Kiyone means pure or innocent voice. Seion means
unvoiced sound. Cool, ne?
	2. I'm writing these out as scripts rather than compositions
because they take up less
	    space and are faster to read. If you like it good. If
you don't, suffer!
	3. If you're wondering about the music all of it is taken
from Tenchi CD's ("Sacrifice" is from a Tench TV CD drama but if
you have a REAL AUDIO player you can hear it on the Tenchi
Ring Website or you can hear part of it on AIC's website. Any
Tenchi fan should visit it for bits of other songs not yet
released over here.
	4.This series will run from Episode 27 to 52. If you want to
see the first 26 episodes
watch the Tenchi Universe TV series.
