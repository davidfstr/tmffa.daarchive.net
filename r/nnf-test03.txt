Trapped in Love
	
Skipping ahead.. 8 months later.

	Washu sat curled up reading a science book. She knew everything 
having to do with science, but you know that when you have summer break 
between school grades, you can tend to lose some information. Since 
Washu is taking a short break from her science experiments, due to her 
pregnancy, she spent some of her free time reading about the one thing 
she loves the most (besides Tenchi of course).
	Tenchi leaned over and kissed Washu gently. "Love is based on 
chaotic theory huh?"
	Washu smiled and nodded, "but sometimes chaotic things are good."
	Tenchi laughed.

	Tokimi found Doctor Clay experimenting with some acids and 
chemicals using various beakers and cylinders.
	"Ahem," Tokimi cleared her throat.
	"Lady Tokimi!" Doctor Clay turned around.. "Sorry, I didn't see 
you come in."
	"Never mind that right now. I got your message, that you came up 
with a plan to capture Washu?" Tokimi folded her arms.
	"Uh, yes!" Doctor Clay turned around to continue working on his 
experiment.
	"Will you tell me?"
	"No. It's a surprise."
	"I command you to tell me! I don't need another failed attempt! 
If this plan fails, then it's over for you! If you tell me your plan 
now, I could tell you to continue, or if you need to come up with a new 
one." Tokimi glared at Doctor Clay who replied without turned to face 
the goddess.
	"It will work. Never doubt a genius!"

	"Sasami, could you give me two servings?" Washu begged.
	"Um, sure Washu," Sasami smiled.
	Boy Washu turned into a pig since she got pregnant! Ryoko 
thought.
	"I heard that Ryoko!" Washu glared at her. "Just because I'm 
married doesn't mean I don't have that mental link with you still!"
	"Aheh..heh..yea, sorry mom." Ryoko muttered and began to devour 
her meal trying to avoid a lecture from her mother, or even worse: that 
awkward silence.
	"Well don't forget Ryoko, she is eating for two, herself and the 
baby," Ayeka explained.
	"I know that!" Ryoko snapped. "Besides, why are you on her side? 
She took our Tenchi away from us!"
	"I cannot change someone's heart, and Ryoko, I was just giving 
you the facts!" Ayeka stared at Ryoko with a neutral expression.
	"Washu, can I baby-sit the baby for you sometimes?" Mihoshi 
asked.
	Washu looked nervously at Kiyone and barely shook her head and 
mouthed 'no!'
	"Um, I'll keep that in mind Mihoshi, heh," Washu hesitated.
	"Yay!" Mihoshi jumped up and down knocking her dinner on the 
floor. "Oops!"
	"Mihoshi! Next time get hyper outside!" Kiyone began picking up 
some of the food that had fallen off the plate.
	"I'll take care of that Kiyone," Sasami offered. "You go ahead 
and finish your meal!"
	"Thanks Sasami," Kiyone smiled.
	Washu smiled as she looked down at her belly. Already she loved 
her baby so much.
	"It looks like in a month or less this baby will be born!" Washu 
grinned.
	"Did you come up with a name for her?" Sasami asked.
	Washu looked at Tenchi and nodded, letting him know that she 
wanted him to announce it.
	"Her name will be Miyami," Tenchi held up a white blanket with 
the name is pink cursive letters.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*

	Doctor Clay sat at a screen watching everything that happens in 
Washu's life. He sat waiting for Washu's baby to be born. It seemed 
like forever he has waited and every month he had to come up with a new 
excuse on why he didn't capture Washu.
	Washu was talking about her baby.Doctor Clay looked closer at the 
screen trying to make out the letters on a snow-white cotton 
blanket.her baby Miyami. Moments later he saw Washu go into false 
labor.
	"Yes! The time will come soon!" Doctor Clay cackled.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*

	"Washu! Are you okay?" Tenchi rushed to Washu who fell down in 
pain on the way to her lab.
	"No!" Washu began to cry.
	"Is it time?!" Ayeka ran and knelt beside Tenchi. "I'll get 
father, and Yosho, maybe they could get a doctor."
	"No, I think it's just false labor. But it's just as painful!" 
Washu formed fists and punched her knees hoping it would help ease the 
pain, she really knew it wouldn't help but did this anyways.
	Moments later, the pain settled a bit and Sasami gave Washu a 
glass of water.
	"I don't know how I will handle this," Washu said between taking 
sips of the ice-cold water.
	Tenchi didn't know what to say so he hugged Washu, and they 
stayed in that position for nearly an hour.

Later_______________________________________

	"Washu, since we don't know exactly when you will actually go 
into labor, we found a doctor who is willing to stay here until the 
baby is born.for free! This is Doctor C." Yosho introduced the man.
	Doctor Clay stood in his disguise. Soon, he will have the baby is 
his grasp and Tenchi nearby.
	"Dinner is ready! Oh, we have a guest! I better set up an extra 
place," Sasami smiled.
	Ryoko looked over at this new doctor. Something was wrong. She 
could feel it. But what was it? Was the person evil? Or was Washu 
messing with her mind? Maybe the person isn't exactly evil, but is 
controlled by someone evil, like Mayuka was.
	Everyone took their seats around the table and began to eat 
Sasami's delicious meal.
	"So tell me, how did you find Doctor C?" Mihoshi asked,
	"Well, I went to a local doctor's office, and Doctor C stood 
outside and asked if I knew Washu. I said 'yes' and he told me that it 
is nearing the time she was to give birth and since we live so far from 
town, it may be easier and quicker if a doctor came to stay until the 
baby's born." Noboyuki explained.
	"Oh," Ayeka wasn't quite satisfied, and neither was Washu.
	"How did you know? I mean, you're not my doctor. I never even saw 
you at the office before," Washu looked suspiciously at Doctor C.
	"Uhhh, I got transferred all over after graduating from medical 
school. When I got to this doctor's office, I looked over some files 
and saw yours. You see, I've been in the same low position since I got 
into my actual career for the first time, I thought if I delivered your 
baby, I could maybe get a promotion," Doctor C replied.
	"Uh.okay, whatever," Ryoko rolled her eyes.
	Don't be rude Ryoko! Washu sent the message to her daughter.
	Mom! I don't think that guy is safe! I think he is evil, I! Washu 
discontinued listening to her daughter's message and glared at her.
 	After dinner Washu headed off to bed when Doctor C stopped her.
	"Uh, let me know if you have any more contractions or anything," 
he told her.
	"Um okay," Washu yawned and began to climb into bed.
	"Good night Washu!" Doctor C pulled his mask off and Washu's eyes 
widened.
	"No!!!!!!!!!" Washu screamed. Stress overwhelmed her and she went 
into premature labor.
	"Washu?" Tenchi opened the door to see Washu screaming.
	"Just in time Tenchi. Get over here! I learned doctors usually 
let the father help out in the process," Doctor Clay said, back in his 
disguise.
	"Already in labor? Didn't see have at least another 2 weeks or 
so?" Tenchi asked.
	"Oh, she just got stressed out which cause premature labor, it's 
becoming more common," he explained.
	Then, Washu's screams were replaced with Miyami's screams. Doctor 
Clay wrapped Miyami in a blanket and gave her to Tenchi.
	"Shouldn't Washu hold her first?" Tenchi looked over at the 
exhausted, but smiled Washu.
	"No!" Doctor Clay removed his mask once more and signaled Tokimi. 
Then Doctor Clay, Tenchi and Miyami vanished.
	"Tenchi! Miyami! No!!" Washu screamed.
	Ryoko ran to Washu and hugged her. I knew it!
	No need to be cocky Ryoko! Not at a time like this. Washu 
messaged her.
	Ryoko looked at Washu in the eyes and told her, I really wish I 
wasn't right.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*

	Tokimi looked at Tenchi and Miyami.
	"You idiot! I wanted Washu! Not these two little, weaklings!" 
Tokimi roared.
	"No, Lady Tokimi! This is part of the plan! If Washu loves them 
so much, she'll come after them, we can capture her then!" Doctor Clay 
insisted.
	"What?! Why do you want Washu?" Tenchi asked.
	"Because she left the one place she belongs: ruling the 
universe!" Tokimi said without looking at Tenchi.
	"You're Tokimi, part of the three goddesses Tokimi, Washu, and 
Tsunami!" Tenchi seemed fairly amused.
	"Oh, has she spoken of me? And you heard about Tsunami?" Tokimi's 
attention was on this now.
	"Yea! And not only have I heard about Tsunami, but I met her, 
and," Tenchi was interrupted by Tokimi's rages.
	"YOU MET HER?! I'VE LOOKED FOR HER FOR YEARS!"
	Tenchi knew he was about to die, but Doctor Clay returned 
Tokimi's attention to capturing Washu. Tenchi wasn't at all relieved.
	"I am Tenchi, part of the Jurai's royal family! I can summon the 
light hawk wings, however, I do not want to harm you! Just leave Washu 
alone and I'll let you live."
	"Hahaha, you little dimwit! I'm a goddess, I cannot die!" 
Tokimi's laugh sounded more evil than Washu's when she wanted to try 
out a new experiment on Tenchi.
	Her laugh made Tenchi cringe and he tightly closed his eyes 
hoping this was all just a nightmare, but as his eyes reopened, it 
didn't all go away, instead he was trapped in an invention that seemed 
like something Washu created. It was complex, which numerous buttons.
	"Doctor Clay created this machine," Tokimi smiled. "He was also a 
professor, just like Washu."
	Tenchi looked over at Tokimi who held Miyami. Oh dear God, please 
let us all get home safely.
	"Don't worry though, after I get Washu, I'll let you and Miyami 
go home," Tokimi said, as if reading Tenchi's mind.
	"I want Washu to go home too!" Tenchi yelled.
	"She will! Her home is ruling the universe with me!" Tokimi 
laughed again.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*

	Washu ran into her lab and typed on her holographic computer.
	"Doctor Clay, I remember him, I never saw him since he tried to 
capture me for..TOKIMI!"
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
*~*~*~*~*~*

	"Washu is on her way!" Doctor Clay announced after watching Washu 
on the screen.
	"Well, I must admit Doctor Clay, I had my doubts," Tokimi began.
	"Lady Tokimi, not to be rude but, I told you not to doubt a 
genius!"Doctor Clay smirked.
	Just then, Washu appeared. "Tokimi."
	"Washu."
	"Let them go," Washu ordered.
	"Fine. In one condition," Tokimi grinned.
	"What's that?"
	"You stay here and rule the universe with me."
	Washu got angry. "You want me to leave behind the ones I love?"
	"Love? Ha! Goddesses don't love!" Tokimi laughed.
	Tokimi gave Miyami to Tenchi and walked towards Washu.
	Washu pulled out a sword, very similar to Ryoko's and swung at 
Tokimi's feet. Tokimi jumped.
	Tokimi was shocked that Washu was willing to fight for these two 
earthlings, but decided to fight back. A purple, glowing sphere floated 
just above her hand, then she threw it in Washu's direction.
	Washu took a direct hit and collapsed on the ground.
	"Washu!" Tenchi called from the machinery.
	Washu got up, despite the pain, and swung her sword at Tokimi's 
face, scraping her cheek, which left a bloody, cut running from her 
temple to chin.
	Tokimi was more than outraged about this and pulled out her own 
sword a bit larger than Washu's.
	Cling! Clung! Clank!
	The swords made a loud sound as they made contact.
	Washu was still determined to win back her and her family's 
freedom, even when Tokimi seemed to get dangerously close to killing 
her.
	"Want to give up sister?" Tokimi smiled her evil grin after 
knocking Washu down.
	"Never bitch!" Washu jumped up and fired from a pistol-like gun 
similar to the Galaxy Police's guns, but since this was created by the 
Greatest Scientific Genius, it was much more powerful.
	The bullet hit Tokimi in the arm in which her sword was held by, 
and she dropped the sword.
	Washu pointed her sword at Tokimi and knelt down, "Let them go."
	Tokimi watched Washu go over to Tenchi and Miyami and hugged 
them.
	Tenchi handed a crying Miyami to Washu, "All this excitement woke 
her up."
	Washu held Miyami in her arms and hummed the tune to the lullaby 
her mother sang to her.
	Tokimi observed this and for the very first time a tear rolled 
down her face.
	"I came too late, there is no way you can become neutral again is 
there? My sister is trapped in love!" Tokimi sobbed. "Look at you! You 
have a husband and daughter! I have no one!"
	Washu smiled sympathetically. "Tokimi, yes it's too late for me 
to change, but it's not for you."


Does Tokimi change and begin to love someone? Does Washu let Mihoshi 
take care of the baby? 

Some things to consider for our next chapter!
