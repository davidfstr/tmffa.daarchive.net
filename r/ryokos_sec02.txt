Chapter 2: A creature and the shack
"Ok, I have everything I need for 3 days right Sassami?" Ryoko inquired. 
"Yes silly. Oh and when you're up there say hi to Yosho for me." Sassami
 replied. "Ok I will. Good Bye Tenchi," she cries as flies toward the 
cabin, "I shall miss you!"
	As she flies she looks down and sees a creature of some sort, 
and begins to descend. "What are you," Ryoko asks as she looks at it, 
"Oh, your wounded come with me." She picks up the small creature and 
flies with it to the cabin. After 5 minutes of flying she lands at her 
home for the next three days. "Ok, you get some sleep little guy, I 
will have Yosho look at you in the morning. Maybe he can heal that 
wound of yours. As Ryoko settled down to sleep, the creature started 
to yell. "Huh? What's wrong little guy?" Ryoko asked still half asleep.
She decided to open the door and when she did her jaw dropped a mile. 
"HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? This...this is my dream world, but how did you 
know I never told anyone? Not even Washu knew about this place." Ryoko 
asked as she thought about a logical awnser. "Oh I get it, you're 
telepathic," Ryoko stated "Hey I just thought of a name for you. From 
now on I will call you Little One. How do you like it?" Ryoko asked as 
Little One did a back flip.  All of a sudden Ryoko blurted "Hey Tenchi, 
over here!" She yelled when she saw Tenchi. "Hi Ryoko, what are you 
doing up here?," Tenchi inquired, " oh well, lets go see if the 
preparations for tonight night are done." Tenchi said. "What's 
happening tonight?" Ryoko asked. "Don't you remember? Tonight we get 
married." Tenchi explained.
