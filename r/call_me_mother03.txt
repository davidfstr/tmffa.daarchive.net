Call me Mother! Part 3 *~*By NeptuneDream*~*
    Hello once again! See, a plot is starting to develop here!! Yeah, I
know, the first part was so serious and talky-talky, but now it's time to
have some action occur! It will still mostly be pretty serious, but now with
more of a "Tenchi-like" atittude. More action, more love, I hope to make it
everything anyone could want (Except lemon, I THINK...) As always, Tenchi

so short! ^_^;; Thanks! Here goes!
---------------------------------------------------

It was evening at the Masaki house. Outside, a cool breeze blew through the
trees that enveloped the house. Ryoko, sitting on a tree branch above the
sparkling lake, sighed and looked over at Tenchi, who was sitting across
from her in a nearby tree.
 "Tenchi?"
 "Yes?"
 "Do you love me?"
Tenchi looked over at her. "What kind of a question is that?"
 "I dunno..."
 "Yes, Ryoko, I love you, and I will do anything in my power to protect us
and keep us together. Is that enough?"
Ryoko smiled. "It feels so good coming from you..."
Tenchi smiled back. " Ryoko?"
 "Yes, Tenchi?"
 "Are you worried about what's been happening?"
 "With the dream?"
 Tenchi nodded. "Yep," he said.
Ryoko shrugged. "Well, you know, we've been through stuff like this so much
before, and, I mean, none of us has ever been hurt or anything without being
brought back, we've stayed together for this long, so why would anything
happen now?"
Tenchi shook his head. "You're right," he said. He looked out into the sky.
It was getting late. "We should be getting back now," he said with a smile,
"Everyone's probably worrying about us."
Ryoko smiled and stretched. "I bet. We've been out here all day."
Tenchi looked at her. "It was nice though, wasn't it?"
 Ryoko smiled a little. "Yep."
Tenchi jumped down from the branch and Ryoko soon appeared next to him.
"Did we miss dinner?" she asked, a bit shocked.
"Oh jeez, this was supposed to be a special dinner tonight, wasn't it?"
Tenchi said, gulping.
Ryoko grabbed Tenchi's hand. "We'd better get going!" Tenchi felt himself
being lifted off the ground as Ryoko flew them to the house.
-----------------------------------

 As they entered the door to the kitchen, no one was there. "Oh jeez, I knew
it!" exclaimed Tenchi.
"We missed it..."
"Wait, there's a note." Tenchi picked up a small slip of paper on the
kitchen counter. He read it.
  "Dear Tenchi and Ryoko,
      Since you two have been gone all day, and Washu hasn't come out of her
lab at all, the rest of us decided to go out shopping instead of making
dinner tonight. Don't worry! I'll just make my special dinner tomorrow
night! Have fun, you two!
        Love, Sasami"
 Ryoko sighed. "Well, that's a relief, she's not mad..."
  "Yeah..."
 Ryoko looked seductively at Tenchi. "Well, Washu's in her lab, she hasn't
come up all day, and we have the house to ourselves..."
Tenchi smiled. "I know what you're thinking and I like it."
Ryoko giggled. "Shall we?"
 "After you," Tenchi guestured.
---------------------------------------

  Washu was even more exhausted than she had been that morning. She had been
working, reasearching, and investigating in her lab all day, and she still
couldn't find much on why she and Tenchi had the same dream the night
before. She rested her head on the console of her computer, sighing.
<Perhaps I should find Tenchi and Ryoko and just tell them that I haven't
found out anything, I've left them out in the dark for so long...> She
sighed, and pulled herself up from the desk. She ran into a pink tank top,
bent over and looking at her monitor.
"M...Mihoshi...?!"
 "Hi Washu, whatcha doing?"
 "Uh..I...How did you...," she pointed at the door. "...I'm not even going
to ask, I'm going upstairs...follow me up, I don't trust you down here..."
 "Okay!" Mihoshi said cheerfully.
 Washu sighed and went through the door which had just appeared from out of
nowhere, and when she appeared in the living room, no one was there.
 "Mihoshi? Where is everyone?"
 "Ohh, they all went shopping tonight."
 "Why didn't you go??"
 "I dunno...You think I should have?"
Washu facefaulted. "Yes, I think you should have!"
Mihoshi stopped and thought for a minute. "Speaking of that, I left
something in the lab!"
Washu sweatdropped. "Wait..." But Mihoshi was gone. Washu sighed and looked
around. <Where are they?>
She heard a noise coming from Tenchi's bedroom.
<Well, might as well go up and look...>
She sighed tiredly and made her way up the stairs.
"Tenchi? Ryoko?" She opened the door to Tenchi's bedroom. She stopped short
when she saw what was going on. Ryoko and Tenchi were laying on top of each
other. Ryoko had just begun to unzip Tenchi's pants.
"MOOMMMMM!!"
"Oops, did I catch you two at a wrong time?"
 "YESSS!"
Tenchi jumped up. He zipped his pants back up and walked over to Washu. But
Ryoko just sat there, pouting.
 "Did you find out something, Ms.Washu?"
 "...No Tenchi, not anything that we don't already know."
Tenchi sighed."This is great, just great..."
 "There was nothing I could do that would make a difference in what we know.
I'll try my best, but I think I've tried everything."
 "Thanks for everything, Little Washu."
 "Good night, Tenchi. Good night, Ryoko."
 "Hmph..."
Tenchi sighed after Washu left. He climbed back on the bed next to Ryoko.
Ryoko perked up.
 "Shall we continue?"
 "Sorry Ryoko, I'm not in the mood now."
Ryoko sweatdropped, then sighed.
 "I'm tired, let's just go to bed."
 "Good night, Tenchi..."
 Tenchi turned off the light.
-----------------------------------------------------
Washu was once again stumped. She had worked so hard all day, and still she
had found nothing. Not even the slightest clue of what had happened, or what
was going to happen. She sighed, and rested her head in her hand...
-----------------------------------------------------
<Tenchi saw himself. He watched as he stood alone, illuminating the area of
blackness that surrounded him. He looked around in alarm, trying to figure
out where he was. "What the...?" He saw a figure appear in front of him.
"Tenchi..."
He took out his Tenchi-ken. "Who...Who are you?"
The figure looked at him, frightened. "Y...You don't know?"
His grip on the sword tightened. "No, I don't know! Who are you?"
The figure reached out for him. "Tenchi...It's..."
The figure suddenly disappeared. Another figure appeared in it's place, this
one about the same size.
"You'll never find out, Tenchi Masaki..."
Tenchi stood alone in the darkness. He couldn't see a thing in front of him,
then suddenly, the light came back...>
Tenchi sat up, a cold sweat on his face.
"Tenchi, are you okay?" Ryoko sat up next to him and rubbed his chest
lightly.
"I...I had the dream again", he said, breathing hard.
Suddenly, they heard a high-pitched scream coming from below them.
Ryoko looked at him in alarm. "That's Washu! Meet me downstairs!" She
disappeared.
Tenchi took a breath and started to come down the stairs.
Washu stood in the living room, pale as a ghost. "I had it again," she
stated.
Tenchi nodded. "So did I...what could it be?"
Washu shook her head. "I really can't say..." she turned away. "Why can't I
figure it out?", she said, sounding frustrated.
Ryoko put a consoling hand on Washu's shoulder. "It's okay, Mom, I'm sure
we'll find out sometime..."
Washu turned to Ryoko, tears forming in her eyes. "But what if it's too
late?"
Ryoko looked at her mother, concern and slight fear in her eyes. "What do
you mean?"
 "Well, these things don't just happen for no reason at all, especially when
two people get the same dream," she said, "Something's going to happen, and
if it will, it'll happen soon, that's for sure."
Tenchi slammed his fist down on the table. "We can't just sit and let this
happen!"
Ryoko looked over at Washu. "Tenchi's right," she said, "If something does
happen to you two, I want to be able to prevent it as best as I can..."
Washu thought for a moment. "We might be able to find where we need to go."
Tenchi looked at Washu. "How?"
 "Well Tenchi, where were you in your dream?"
 "That's kind of a hard to answer question, Washu..."
 "Well, find a way to answer it."
 "Uh...well, all I remember was it was completely dark, but it had a
familiar sense to it...there wasn't much noise there, only...a little
buzzing in the background..."
Washu thought for a moment. "Why would the dream take place in my lab?"
 "The lab?"
 "Yeah, you said it was dark and familiar. Where else would it be?"
 "I guess it makes sense..."
 Ryoko shrugged. "Okay then, let's go check there."
They entered the lab through the door to the broom closet under the stairs.

      END OF PART 3

   Yep, that chapter was all talk. But we got some good stuff coming up!!!
Be patient, and keep reading. This story isn't the best I've ever done, but
I wanted to try something that hasn't been done TOO much. No "Kagato coming
back" story, no "Tokimi strikes" story, (Although a lot of those were
wonderful, but they were done by TALENTED authors, not little amateurs like
me ^_^;;) But, hey, life is an expiriment. If you don't try new things once
and a while and take a chance, your life will be boring!! KEEP READING AND
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK AT NeptuneDream@n2sun.com! I will keep going on this!
You gotta end what you start, ne? TENCHI MUYO! AND ALL CHARACTERS ARE
PROPERTY OF PIONEER AND AIC. THANKS! ^_~
