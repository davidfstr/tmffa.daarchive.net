Onmitsu No Ai: Epilogue

Excerpt from the Diary of Tenchi Masaki:

Nov 25th, 1996....


	Well, the Kain Incident, as Trakal calls it, has been
 resolved. Trakal's pretending to be mad that he didn't get to 
 kill Kain personally, and maybe he is a little upset about 
 that, but I happen to know he's also very happy. Tomorrow is
 his wedding day, you see.
	Speaking of weddings, after my parents graduated from
 high school, dad of course got a job with a building company
 and mom... well she looked after Grampa until dad decided he
 was living comfortably enough to support her and a family.
 	One thing that bothers me, is that my mother may have
 used the very power that could've enabled her to live longer
 to save my life. Trakal blames himself a little, too, since
 she also saved his life. I don't blame him, though. She did
 it for her friend, too. After all, Trakal is the girl's
 fiance. And something Washu passed to me from my mother, a
 little something she said, makes me feel a little better.
 My mother had said, and I quote: 

	"Time is short, but Nobuyuki and I will live our 
   lives to the fullest. That's all that really matters."

 And she's right. That is all that really matters. 

 Well, that's all for this diary for now. It's late and I'm
 tired. Plus it's hard to write anything with Trakal snoring
 in the next room and Ryoko scratching at my door, probably
 to complain about the snoring, or more likely to try and 
 kiss me good night again.

.. And in the inky blackness of space, amidst the debris of
a burned out wreckage, an artificial intelligence awoke, and
openned an electronic eye. Lonely, it sought its masters,
searched on every channel in its database. It had done so for
seven days, without success. Ever since the disaster it had
searched, only taking an occasional break because of the minimal
power supply it had left. And this time, it's search was not
in vain...
