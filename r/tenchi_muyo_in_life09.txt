NO NEED FOR AN ESCAPE

The policeman opens the jail door and showed the way for Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, 
Washu, Miaski, Funaho, and pushes Henrii into the jail cell.
"Hey watch it buddy!" said Henrii.
"Shut up boy, you are in enough trouble already," said the policeman as he 
locked the jail cell's door and left the room.
"So Henrii why are you in jail?" said Tenchi.
"Well it because." said Henrii as he step on the green goo and tried to get 
out.
"What the." said Henrii as he tried to pull his leg out of goo.  He pulls on 
his leg till his other foot was in the goo.
"Just smooth Henrii," said Ryoko.
"Shut up," said Henrii as he tried to balance himself up and grabs Ryoko 
breasts for balance.
"What the." said Ryoko as she pushes Henrii hands away from her breast and 
slaps him twice.  Henrii fell on ass with his foot still stuck to the goo.
"Did you know your breast feels like if they were saggy," said Henrii 
laughing.
"Why you!" said Ryoko as she bend down and started to beat Henrii on the 
head.
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow," said Henrii.
"Stop it you two!" said Sasami.
"Sorry Sasami," said Henrii.
"Yeah sorry," said Ryoko as she stops beating Henrii's head.
"We have to get out of this place," said Washu as she brought out her 
computer.
"Why don't we just pay the freaking fine," said Tenchi.
"Yeah, who has money?" said Mihoshi.
"Well don't look at me, I'm dry as a bone because I had to pay all those 
damages," said Henrii.
"What damages?" asked Tenchi.
"Well there damages to the van, buildings, and so on," said Henrii.  Tenchi 
looked at Henrii with a stern look in his eye.
"No worries you can get a new van," smiled Henrii.
"I don't want a new van!" said Tenchi.
"I have some Juri money left so maybe I can pay for the fines for all of 
us," said Funaho.
"Me too," said Miaski.  The policeman returns back to the room and sat down 
in his chair and pickup a magazine.
"Hey excuse me, but was that strip search really unnecessary for me?  I mean 
I don't like those policewomen poking me," said Henrii.
"Whatever," said the policeman as he placed headphones over his ears.
"So Tenchi why are you here?" said Henrii.
"Because, they thought I stole some clothes," said Tenchi.
"Hey you are still in high school right," said Henrii.
"Yeah, so," said Tenchi.
"They pressed so many charges on me because I was too young to drive, 
reckless driving, was on the wrong road, and speeding, I mean the sign says 
115 right?" said Henrii.  All of a sudden Tenchi remember that he wasn't 
supposed to drive the van till he was out of high school.
"Henrii, 115 doesn't mean the speed up to 115." said Tenchi as he was 
interrupted by Ryoko.
"You know what, I don't want to be in this goo with Henrii anymore," said 
Ryoko as she teleported out of the goo.
"Why didn't you do that before?" said Henrii.
"Well because I liked how that goo squish between my toes," said Ryoko.
"Oh, can a try?" said Mihoshi as she steps into the green goo with Henrii.  
Henrii slaps his hand on his face.
"Why did you do that?! Don't you know that you won't be able to get out," 
said Henrii.
"Oh no!" said Mihoshi as she started to cry.
"Come on Tenchi let's get out of here," said Ryoko as she pushes Tenchi into 
a wall.
"Ow!" said Tenchi as he slid off the wall.
"Oh yeah, you can't go though walls, huh," said Ryoko as she pickup Tenchi 
and went though the wall with Tenchi.
"Hey were are you two going!" said Sasami.
"Leaving this joint," said Ryoko.
"Hey how about us! You ain't leaving your mother here!" said Washu
"Yeah!" said Miaski with an upset look on her face.
"Ok, ok," said Ryoko as she brought Washu, Ryo-Ohki, Sasami, Miaski, Funaho, 
and Mihoshi through the wall.  Ryoko came back to see who was left to pick 
up.  There were only Henrii and Ayeka.
"Choose me next please," said Henrii.  Ryoko picks up Ayeka on her shoulders 
and leaves the jail cell.
"Let go of me you demon!" said Ayeka as she stuggles on Ryoko's shoulders as 
they disappear.
"What a b*tch, she rather bring Ayeka than me," said Henrii shaking his head 
and still stuck in goo.  Ryoko reappears and said to Henrii.
"Tenchi force me to get you."
"About time," said Henrii as Ryoko pulled Henrii out of the goo and brought 
him out of the jail cell to where everybody was waiting for both of them.
"Henrii where is the van?" asked Tenchi.
"You know you are not suppose to drive till you are out of high school and 
by the way its in a dump yard where they will burn it later," said Henrii.
"What!" said Tenchi.
"Yep, it's totaled, that's why I asked you about buying a new car," said 
Henrii.
"Oh man my dad is going to kill me," said Tenchi.
"Don't worry man we can get a brand new car for him," said Henrii.
"I'm so tired! I want to go home," said Ayeka.
"We should take subway and then take a bus back home," said Tenchi.  They 
went down to the subway tunnel.  Back in the jail room where the policeman 
was reading his magazine till a policewoman enters the room.
"Ok we are ready for those people in jail cell 55 to be identify.. What the 
f*ck!" said the policewoman.
"What the. oh my god they have broken out of the cell!" said the policeman 
as he puts down his magazine and his head sets.
"The lock on this cell is still locked! How in the hell did they escape when 
you were watching them!" said the policewoman.
"Ummm err," said the policeman.
"Give me your badge!" said the policewoman.  The policeman gave his badge to 
her and she tore the badge into two with all of her might.
"You are fired from the force!" said the policewoman.  The former policeman 
walked out of the police station with his head down.
"Damn I will never get to know more about that guy I strip searched on," 
said the policewoman.

NO NEED FOR TO TALK ABOUT OLD FLAMES

Tenchi and the Tenchi gang finally reached home at 11:30 at night.  Back at 
the mall in the Japanese sushi restaurant in the mall, Maikeru was still 
sitting with a bill of 69191 yen to pay.
"Hey are you going just sit there or going to pay the bill, kid," said the 
waiter cleaning up the restaurant.
"I still waiting for two ladies to come out of the bathroom," said Maikeru.
"I checked, nobody, so just quit complaining and pay that damn bill," said 
the waiter.
"Damn my father is going to kill me," said Maikeru as he slams his head on 
the bar.
"Hey kid don't do that or you might have to pay for damages," said the 
waiter.
"Sorry, damn, damn, damn," said Maikeru.  Back at Tenchi's house all of them 
just fell asleep where they fell.  At about 6:30 that sunshine rays went 
though the house and waking Tenchi up from the floor.
"Oh man, I feel like my back has been pounded by bricks," said Tenchi as he 
looks around.  He saw Ayeka, Miaski, and Sasami sleeping next to each other 
and Funaho was every close to them sleeping on the floor.  Washu was 
sleeping on the floor near her door of her lab.  Mihoshi was sleeping on a 
couch and Ryoko was sleeping on the table.  But where was Henrii and 
Ryo-Ohki?  Ryo-Ohki in her cabbit form hoped out of the kitchen and hoped 
into Tenchi's arms.
"Hey there Ryo-Ohki you woke up early ::yawn::" said Tenchi.
"Miya miya miya!" said Ryo-Ohki.
"Do you know where Henrii is?" said Tenchi.
"Miya," said Ryo-Ohki shaking her head no.  All of a sudden an arm pop out 
from a beam that supported the roof of the living room.
"What?" said Tenchi as he looks up.
"Miya?" said Ryo-Ohki.  All of a sudden Henrii fell off the beam and heading 
towards for Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki.
"Miya!" cried out Ryo-Ohki as she jumped out of Tenchi's arm and ran back to 
the kitchen.
"AWWWWW!" cried out Tenchi as Henrii lands on top of him.
"::BIG YAWN:: What a night," said Henrii as he scratched his back.
"Mmpphh!" said Tenchi.  Henrii got up and sees Tenchi on the floor.
"You know Tenchi its not a good place to sleep below me," said Henrii.
"You fell on top of me," said Tenchi.
"Oh sorry Tenchi," said Henrii as he helps him up.  Ryoko woke up and said 
to Tenchi.
"Oh Tenchi, are you ready for our date," said Ryoko as she rubbed her eyes 
and teleported out of the room and reappears in the clothes that she took 
from the mall.
"Oh that reminds me where is my bed sheet," said Tenchi.
"Oh here," said Henrii as he pushed some buttons on his watch and all the 
bags, boxes, and the huge teddy bear fell on the floor.  Everybody woke up 
because of all the boxes and bags fell on the floor.
"Oh good morning Lord Tenchi, Commander, oh and Ryoko is awake too," said 
Ayeka.
"Yes I'm awake thank you," said Ryoko as she sticks out her tongue at her.
"AHH! Oh look I'm right next to my lab door," said Washu as she was about 
enter the door Henrii said.
"Morning Washu, nice hair," laughed Henrii.  Washu touches her hair and ran 
into her lab.
"Morning Tenchi, Commander Lok, Ryoko, Sasami, Ayeka, Mihoshi, and sis," 
said Miaski.
"Morning," said all of them.
"Tenchi, I never new sleeping on the floor without anything can be so 
comfortable," said Miaski.
"Same here," said Funaho.
"Well anyway are you ready for our date soon Tenchi," said Ryoko.
"Soon!?" said Tenchi.  The lab door opens and out comes an adult Washu.
"See look, Washu is already ready for her date with Henrii, and I already 
planned out where are we going and doing when I was dreaming," said Ryoko.
"Like what?" said Sasami eagerly to hear the plans.
"Yeah," said Ayeka with her arms crossed.
"Well first we will go to a nightclub, stay there till Tenchi is drunk and 
we will come back and make love till the next day," said Ryoko.  Ayeka was 
slowly moving to Ryoko with her arms raised and going for Ryoko's neck.
"Whoa there Ayeka," said Henrii as she held back Ayeka.
"Please Commander, just let me move a few more feet to place my hands on 
Ryoko's neck," said Ayeka in a calm voice.
"Don't worry princess, I will wear protection, ha ha ha ha ha!" laughed 
Ryoko.
"Why you little sl.!  I will tear you from limb from limb!" cried out Ayeka 
as she pushes Henrii away and charges at Ryoko.  Ryoko quickly teleported 
away and reappears behind Tenchi.  Ayeka turned around and headed for Ryoko 
and Tenchi.
"Tenchi save me!" said Ryoko as she hid behind Tenchi.
"GRRRRR!" screamed Ayeka as she runs towards to them.  All of a sudden an 
arm went around Ayeka's waist and she was lifted into Henrii's chest where 
he held her in.
"What are you doing Ayeka have you lost it!" said Henrii holding back Ayeka.
"Let go of me, I command you!" said Ayeka as she punches Henrii in the 
chest.
"Ayeka!  I thought I taught you to become a queen not a some weird pysco!" 
scolded Miaski.  Ayeka stopped and Henrii let go of Ayeka.  Ayeka just ran 
upstairs crying.
"I'm going to see Ayeka," said Sasami as she went upstairs to find her 
sister and Ryo-Ohki followed behind her.
"Come on, I think it's time we have a talk with Ayeka, come on Miaski," said 
Funaho as Miaski and Funaho went upstairs.
"Are you alright Henrii dear?" said adult Washu trying to cross though the 
boxes and bags.  Washu came up to Henrii and hugs him.
"Morning Henrii how did you sleep?" said Washu.
"Ok," said Henrii.
"Was the couch comfortable for you?  You can always sleep with me if you 
wanted to," giggled Washu.
"I never slept on the couch I slept up there?" said Henrii as he pointed up 
to the beam on the ceiling.
"You mean you didn't sleep downstairs?" said Washu.
"Yep, I slept up there last night," said Henrii.  Washu thought to herself 
then who in the world did I kiss good night too.  Mihoshi went to the mirror 
to fix her hair and saw a pink lipstick mark on her side of her mouth.
"What is this lipstick on my mouth?" said Mihoshi.  Washu turns pale white; 
she sticks out her tongue and started to scratch it.
"What are you doing Washu?" said Henrii looking at her with a confused look.
"Nothing just nothing Henrii," said Washu as she wiped her saliva in her 
pocket and then she placed her arm around Henrii.
"What is that smell, it smells like an early morning bad breath or 
something," said Henrii sniffing the air.  Washu quickly covered her mouth 
and ran back to her lab.
"What's up with Washu today?" said Tenchi.
"I don't know, I can never understand women, Tenchi," said Henrii.
"Oh really?" said Tenchi.
"I have dated a lot of girls in the GP headquarters umm. I can't remember a 
girl's name who was like crazy for me.hmm she had like green hair and always 
where a red or orange band over her forehead," said Henrii still thinking of 
the name.
"Kiyoneee? She is my partner!  She is like my bestest bestest bestest friend 
I have!" said Mihoshi.
"Yeah that's right, Kiyone, when I finally went out with her, I found out 
that she is a crazy about being in the GP.  She would talk about the GP, 
talk about the training, she also talked about if we get married our 
children will join the GP, and so on and so on about the GP.  When I 
actually broke up with her she got really pissed at me. I don't understand 
why is she so pissed at me.
"Kiyone told me that you have a big ego problem and that your hair was 
stupid and eyes is stupid and face is stupid and smile is stupid and she 
wants to kill you," said Mihoshi.
"Oh well, I get that a lot when I break up with girls in the GP, they always 
want to kill me and I don't know why," said Henrii.
"Oh ok!" smiled Mihoshi.
So do you have an old flame or flamessss?" said Henrii as he emphasizes on 
the s.
"Me umm no, but well there is this cute girl I really like in school and her 
name is Anjera, she has like the most perfect curves in the world!  Every 
single guy I know is in love with her!  I have kissed her on her check 
before on a dare," said Tenchi.
"So how did it go?" said Henrii.
"It was good for the first 2 seconds before she slapped me," said Tenchi 
looking at the floor.
"Was it that bad Tenchi," said Henrii.
"I don't know," said Tenchi
"Oh well, women." said Henrii.
"If you can't understand them," said Tenchi.
"You can't win them," said Henrii shaking his head.

NO NEED FOR BREAKFAST

"Do you understand me Tenchi?" said Ryoko.
"Sorta, sometimes you don't make any sense to me," said Tenchi.
"What do you mean that I don't make any sense! Huh Tenchi," said Ryoko.
"Well sometimes you just run crying and I don't know why," said Tenchi.
"Well anyway are you ready Tenchi for our date?  Its only just a few minutes 
away," smiled Ryoko.
"A date at 8:30 A.M.  That's a first," said Henrii.
"What do you mean Henrii?" said Ryoko.
"Well most dates start at night not in the morning," said Henrii.
"Is that right Tenchi?" said Ryoko.
"I think so because most of my friends do, they go at around 7 to 8:30 P.M." 
said Tenchi.
"Fine, we will go at 8:30 P.M.  I will just sit here and wait and maybe 
watch some TV," said Ryoko as she turns on the TV.
"That's about like 13 hours of sitting and waiting Ryoko," said Henrii.
"Oh well," said Ryoko as she started to channel surf.  Sasami and Ryo-Ohki 
came back down and said.
"I better start cooking breakfast," smiled Sasami.
"Can I help Sasami?" said Mihoshi.
"Sure Mihoshi you can help," said Sasami.
"Miya," said Ryo-Ohki.  As they entered the kitchen and started to make 
breakfast.  About an hour later Washu opened her door of her lab and slowly 
walk up to Henrii's way.  As she makes her way to Henrii she tripped on a 
bag and fell on her face.
"Washu!  Are you alright?" said Henrii as she ran up to her and helped her 
up.
"Now I am," said Washu as she fell right into Henrii's chest and her breath 
smelled like if she just ate a huge bunch of mints.  Henrii kisses Washu on 
top of her head and Ryoko watches her mother being all sweet to Henrii.  
Ryoko thought to herself they would out stage Tenchi and I on our date.  
Maybe I should not bring Washu and Henrii with Tenchi and I.  I better tell 
them that or its too late.  Well I do have time anyway like about 13 hours 
to tell them anyway.
"Breakfast is ready!" said Mihoshi.  Tenchi went into the dinning room and 
smelled the beautiful aroma of food on the table.
"Wow what smells so great," said Tenchi as he sat down and waited for the 
others to come down for breakfast.
"Food!" said Mihoshi smiling.
"Ryoko, Washu, and Henrii time for breakfast," said Sasami as she went into 
the living room and sees Henrii holding Washu in his arms and Ryoko on the 
couch watching them.
"Hey Ryoko are you coming for breakfast?" said Sasami as she looked at 
Henrii and Washu.
"Yeah I'm coming," said Ryoko as she teleported out of the couch and 
teleported next to Tenchi.
"Washu?  Henrii? Are you two coming for breakfast?" asked Sasami.
"Oh yeah, yes Sasami," said Henrii as she let go of Washu and went to the 
dinning room and sat down across from Tenchi.  Washu followed after Henrii 
and sat down by Henrii.
"Do you think it would be ok to start without Ayeka, Miaski, and Funaho?" 
said Henrii to Sasami
"I think so, I think we can start without them," smiled Sasami.
"Hot soup made by me!" said Mihoshi in an apron, as she took a huge gallon 
pot filled with hot soup and walk towards to the table.  On the floor there 
is wet seaweed on the floor and Mihoshi walked on it and started to slip.
"Oh no Mihoshi!" said Sasami.
"Miya!" said Ryo-Ohki,
"Whoa, oh nooooooooo!" said Mihoshi as she threw the pot in the air.  Washu 
sees the pot and ducks under the table.
"Huh?" said Henrii and sees the gallon pot coming to his way.  The gallon 
pots lands on Henrii's head and spills all the hot soup over him and on the 
table.
"AHHHHHHHHHH! THAT'S IS HOT! But good!" cried out Henrii.  Ryoko quickly 
teleported away because she didn't want soup on the clothes that she took 
from the mall.  Some of the soup landed on Tenchi's lap and he quickly jump 
up.
"Wow that is hot," said Tenchi.  Henrii lifts the gallon pot over his head 
and placed it on the floor.  He was covered with seaweed, tofu, and hot 
soup.  His face was all red because of the hot soup.
"I'm so sorry Henrii, will you forgive me?" said Mihoshi as she started to 
cry.
"I forgive you Mihoshi and by the way this soup is good, you are just as 
good a Sasami," smiled Henrii.
"Thank you Henrii!" said Mihoshi as she ran to hug Henrii and blew her nose 
on Henrii's hair and Henrii's mouth dropped open in disgust.  Under the 
table was thinking to herself.  If Mihoshi can cook that well can I cook 
just as good.  Henrii would really love me!  Washu started to daydream under 
the table.  ::::::: IN WASHU DREAM A MATURE HENRII WITH A MUSTACH SITING 
LIKE A GENTLEMAN WAITING FOR DINNER AND A WASHU BRINGS IN A BEAUTIFUL 
ASSORTMENT OF SUSHI TO THE TABLE.  HENRII PICKS UP A SUSHI WITH HIS 
CHOPSTICK AND DUNKS THE SUSHI INTO THE SOY SOUCE. HE PUTS THE SUSHI INTO HIS 
MOUTH AND STARTED TO CHEW AND HE SWALLOWED IT.  HENRII TURNS AROUND AND SAID 
TO WASHU "THAT WAS SO GOOD!  YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT COOK, VERY BEAUTIFUL, 
SEXY, SUPER SMART WIFE.  NO WONDER YOU ARE THE NUMBER ONE SCIENTIST IN THE 
UNIVERSE." HENRII STANDS UP AND GIVES WASHU A PASSIONATE KISS.::::::  Washu 
starts to giggle and hears her name being repeated and shook her head and 
got out of her dream.
"Washu are you there?  Washu?  Washu? Washu are you there?" said Tenchi 
looking at her under the table.
"Yeah I'm here," said Washu as she got out of the bottom of the table.  She 
looks at Henrii and sees Mihoshi hugging Henrii and sees Mihoshi licked 
Henrii's neck.
"Hey you are right Henrii, my soup does taste good," smiled Mihoshi.
"Let me try!" said Washu as pushes away Mihoshi and starts to lick Henrii's 
cheeks.  Everybody stared at Washu who was licking Henrii's face dry.
"Err Washu don't you think that is enough licking on my face?" said Henrii.  
Washu blushed red and sat back down.  Ryoko reappears back in the dinning 
room and grabs Tenchi by the arm and said to Tenchi.
"Tenchi, I think you had enough of breakfast come on and follow with me."
"Umm Ryoko," said Tenchi as Ryoko dragged him out of the dinning room.
"Umm I better clean this mess," said Mihoshi as she got herself a sponge.
"Well I think I have enough of breakfast for today," said Henrii as he got 
up and left the dinning room.  Washu got up and went to Sasami and Ryo-Ohki.
"Do you think I can cook lunch?" said Washu.
"Sure why not," smiled Sasami.
"Miya," said Ryo-Ohki.
"When do you think I should start cooking Sasami?" said Washu.
"Umm how about like 4 hours later?" said Sasami.
"Ok," said Washu.  Henrii was at the stairs walking to the bathroom to clean 
himself up.  He pulls off some seaweed that was in his hair and as he walks 
by the room where Ayeka, Miaski, and Funaho were talking in.  Henrii stopped 
and placed his ear on the door trying to hear what's going on.
