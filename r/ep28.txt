EPISODE 28:NO NEED FOR TWIN BROTHERS!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: Galaxy Police Interim Headquarters, Tribunal Into the Escape of A-1 Class Crminal
K.A.I.N., Grand Marshall Kurimitsu presiding. Testimony of Special Operative Seion Makibi
on the aiding and abedding of the escape of K.A.I.N by Detective 1st Class Mitsuki Murasume.
SEION:....even though she didn't have access to the K.A.I.N lock, which only the Grand 
Marshall, the Chief Warden, and The Jurian Emperor have access to, being an Internal Affairs
Operative gave her the required access to remove the stasis program that keeps the prisoners
dormant while in subspace which allowed K.A.I.N. to effect his escape some 2 and 1/2 hour 
later, giving her suffecient time to escape. The only mistake she made was to take the ship
that I happened to be on at the time to make her escape. Arresting her was made quite easy.
SECTOR CHIEF SHIRO: Why did she have access to the stasis program?
SEION: We have officers in the subspace prisons that Mitsuki might have to interrogate.
And seeing that nobody belived that K.A.I.N. could escape from a subspace cell the stasis
program was placed on a lower priority clearence.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS CHIEF MIZUHARA: Thank you, Operative Makibi. You may step down. This
Tribunal will set forth court-marshal proceadings against Detective First Class Mitsuki in
two week's time. Baliffs, remove Miss Mitsuki from the room and remove her uniform.
MITSUKI: You and your sister will pay for this, Seion! All of you will pay! YOU'RE ALL DEAD!
DO YOU HEAR ME! DEAD! DEAD! DEAD!!!!
GRAND MARSHALL: Tribunal adjurned. (to Seion) You're right. She really is a nutcase! And I 
always thought she was just a shamless ass-kisser. By the way, Agent Makibi, I need you to
lay low for a while. We're setting up a sub-base in the Sol system for a while until we can
get HQ back up and running.
SEION: The Sol system? But nothing happens out there. Why me?
GRAND MARSHALL: Don't worry. You'll have some good personell to work with. Detective Sergeant
Jinnai, Detective 1st class Demi, 3 rookies and the two resident officers, one of which I'm
am very fond of and someone very close to you.
SEION: Who?

MAKOTO: Snap outta it, will ya, Kiyo?
KIYONE: Why do you sound like my brother, my dear Makoto.
MAKOTO: Because I am your brother! Now wake up!
**************************END DREAM SEQUENCE***************************************
KIYONE: Couldn't you have waited 5 minutes? With you and Mihoshi, I can't even score in my
own fantasies. What a couple of--SEION! What are you doing here? I haven't seen you for 3
years.(she embraces her brother) I missed you so much! Where have you been?
SEION: To answer your 3 questions, I could've but you were starting to touch yourself, I've
been assigned here, and If I told you, I'd have to kill you. Now I'd like to ask you some
questions.  How have you been? What've ya got to eat around here? and Who is that beautiful
creature over there?
KIYONE: Just fine, we're going over to a friend's house for breakfast, and don't you even try
that with Mihoshi!
SEION: Come on! I haven't woken a girl yet by kissing her in her sleep.
KIYONE: Yeah but there's something you should know about--(as Seion kisses Mihoshi, the bubble-
head puts her hand on the back of his head, rolls him over and stradles him.)
MIHOSHI: May I have the name of the prince who awakened this sleeping beauty?
SEION: Hi, I'm Seion Makibi, Kiyone's brother. And you are? 
MIHOSHI: Mihoshi Kuramitsu.
SEION: I'm dead.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The Masaki House. 5:30 am. Guess who's already fighting who over who.
RYOKO: WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
AEKA: I'M SIMPLY STATING A FACT!
SASAMI: Excuse me but...(they are ignoring Sasami)
RYOKO: SHADDUP, AE-CUP!
AEKA: HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT! I'M NOT GOING TO LET THAT ONE PASS!!
SASAMI: Could you two please.....(they still don't know she's there)
RYOKO: I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP, AE-CUP.
AEKA: NO YOU SHUT UP!
RYOKO: NO, YOU SHUT UP!
AEKA: NO, YOU SHUT UP!
RYOKO: NO, YOU SHUT UP!
AEKA: NO, YOU--
NAGI: WHY DON'T YOU BOTH SHUT UP?!
KEN-OKI: CIAO!
RYO-OKI: MIYA!
RYOKO and AEKA: ...yes, ma'am.
TENCHI: Thank you, Nagi. I may as well get ready for school.
AEKA: Please forgive me, Lord Tenchi. I didn't think-
TENCHI: That's right, you didn't think. You woke every one in the house up!
RYOKO: Too bad, Aeka. Tenchi just doesn't lo--
TENCH: The same goes for you, Ryoko! Why don't you two just stay off my back for a while?
SASAMI: Are you alright, Tenchi?
TENCHI: Yes, Sasami. Thank you.
SASAMI: Great! I'll go fix you an extra-special breakfast!
TENCHI: You don't have to do that.
SASAMI: But I love y...( Sasami starts blushing) I love cooking for you! I'll see you at 
breakfast!(she skips down stairs like the cute little girl she is)
TENCHI: Oh, and Ryoko?
RYOKO: Yes, Tenchi?(with puppydog eyes)
TENCHI: Keep your head out of the restroom!(he shuts the door)
AEKA: How does Sasami do that.
RYOKO: Yeah! What does she got that I ain't got more of.
NAGI: Politeness, consideration, kindness, she's a better cook, a better housekeeper, and she
makes the best cup of tea in the Galaxy. 
KEN-OKI: CIAO! Ciao-ciao-ciao!
RYO-OKI: Miya! MIYA!
NAGI: Good point. She also spends more time with Tenchi than she does trying to keep others
away from him!
RYOKO: Shuddup!
AEKA: Yeah! You stay out of this!
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@TWO HOURS LATER@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
SCENE: The dining room. There's Knocking at the front door.
SASAMI: I'll get it!
TENCHI: Don't worry Sasami, I've got it!(Tenchi opens the door and see's a man wearing a black
duster, dark shades, and a wide brimmed black hat) Can I..I h-h-help you?
MAN IN BLACK: I've come for your soul, Mr. Masaki!
TENCHI: DAD, IT'S FOR YOU!
KIYONE:(from outside) Knock off the theatrics, Seion, and get inside.
SEION:(removing the MIB diguise) You never let me have any fun!
KIYONE: Everyone I'd like you to meet my twin brother, Seion.
RYOKO and AEKA: What a babe!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
Tenchi and all the girls are at the beach when Kintaro Oe (Goldenboy) approches
him. 
KINTARO: WOW! Are all these girls yours?
TENCHI: They claim to be.
KINTARO: You are one lucky guy, Mr. Masaki!
(Tenchi pulls out a Twix bar)
KINTARO: Hey, can I have one?
TENCHI: You want Ryoko or Aeka?
KINTARO: YES!!
ANNOUNCER: TWIX! Two for me. None for you!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a buch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: The dining room. For some strange reason, Tenchi is not flanked by Aeka and Ryoko.
Instead they are Seion's problem as they rudely shove Mihoshi and Kiyone away from him.
Tenchi is, however, flanked by Sasami and Nagi. Kiyone is next to Noboyuki, Yosho and Washu.
The cabbits are in the corner eating the usual (and if you don't know what that is you shouldn't
be reading this.)
KEN-OKI: Ciao!
RYO-OKI: Miya-miya-miya-miya.
RYOKO: Some more tea, Seion-chan.
SEION: SEION-CHAN? Now look here, I'm 182cm tall and-
AEKA: You stay stay away from him you disgusting thing!
SEION: Hey, knock it off! I'm not a baton for you to hand off in a relay race.
RYOKO: You heard him, little girl. Back off!
SEION: That was ment for you too, brigand!
NAGI: Good one, Seion.
SEION: Thanks, ol' buddy. So how'd you wind up stranded on this rock?
NAGI: My ship fell in love.
AEKA: Speaking of love, which one of us do think is more attractive: that monster Ryoko or a
beautiful princess like me.
SEION: I don't-
RYOKO: What? You can't make a decision either? Are all guys this indicisive?
SEION: But I've already decided-
AEKA: It's me, isn't it?
RYOKO: Aw, come on! You really think he'd go for a "little" girl like you when he could have a 
"big" me?
SEION: Actually, I like Mi-
AEKO: How dare you speak to like that in front of Lord Seion!
SEION: LORD SEION? Hey now-
RYOKO: I'll speak to you anyway I like, you little bi-
TENCHI: ENOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUGH!
SEION: Thank you, frien-
TENCH: Don't call me "friend." Friends don't come to your house and try to take your girls
away from you.
SEION: Okay, Mr. Masaki. I-
TENCHI: Apology not accepted. You stay away from those two or I'll do something I'll regret 
later!
SEION: Listen to yourself. You sound like a man in love.
TENCHI: YOU TAKE THAT BACK!
SEION: I can't. It's the truth, isn't it?
TENCHI: Well..I,uh...sorta.
SEION: The truth is I don't like either one of these two. Aeka, your a snobbish princess who, if
I wasn't a "pretty boy" wouldn't spit on me if I was on fire. And Ryoko, your selfish, self-
cenered egotist who has jepordized the lives of many of my friends and relatives because of your
greed!
AEKA: You hate me? (starts crying and runs up to her room)
RYOKO: You care to step outside a say that? 
SEION: Not really, but if you insist I guess I'll have to.
RYOKO: I insist!
************************************************************************************************
SCENE: Outside the Masaki House. 8:00 am. Ryoko and Seion are standing face to face. The gang is
gathered around them.
SEION: Okay let's discuss the rules of-
RYOKO: No rules. Just strait out fighting until Yosho declares a winner.
SEION: Are you sure? 
RYOKO: Damn sure!
SEION: Alright. Have it you way. Go to your line so we can start this idiotic display.
RYOKO: Gladly!(as Ryoko turns away from Seion, he lets go with a viscious forearm to the back
of Ryoko's skull, slamming her to the ground. He instantly leaps onto her back, grabs her hair
and sets up for a death blow)
YOSHO: HALT! Winner is Seion! 
SEION: (to Ryoko) Lesson 1. Never turn you back on your opponent. Lesson 2. Becareful what you
wish for you just might get it. And lesson 3. Never get into a fight with a Special Operative,
especially if he's Nano-tech cyborg!
TENCHI: How could you daclare him the winner, Grandpa? He cheated when he hit Ryoko from behind!
YOSHO: You can't accuse a man of breaking the rules when there are none in the first place.
TENCHI: Let me guess _The Book of the Five Rings_? _The Art of War_?
YOSHO: No, actually the premise of a New Japan Wrestling no-disqualification match. Belive it or
not Tenchi he is a VERY compitent fighter. You see that tattoo on his right arm. That is the 
mark of an Amano Torabushi, the greatest pure fighters in the galaxy. And by the markings on his
arm he has mastered 13 of the 15 weapons of a Torabushi, including the Toratrident and the 
"Amano Tuning Fork." I learned sword fighting from one of the greatest Torabushi's that ever
lived. A man named Bouken Makibi.
TENCHI: Makibi? Isn't that Seion's and Kiyone's-
YOSHO: Isn't that your bus, Tenchi?
TENCHI: D'OH! How am I gonna get to school?
RYOKO: I'll take you there, my Tenchi.
TENCHI: No, thanks. It's because of you I'm late.
SEION: I can get you there. Ya ever ridden on the back of a Harley?
TENCHI: How'd you get a Harley?
SEION: I got a Deep Cover control cube that comes complete with transportation. So ya wanna ride
or not?
TENCHI: Sure, why not?
KIYONE: Just don't take him to a strip club.
SEION: Don't you trust me, your dear brother?
KIYONE: No, that's why I'm telling you!
MIHOSHI: Be careful, Seion. I'll miss you!
SEION: I'll only be gone for about 30 minutes.
MIHOSHI: But, that's to still to long! 
SEION: Ya gotta love a girl that's gonna miss you after you've been away for half an hour!
Farewell, Sleeping Beauty!
MIHOSHI: Good bye my prince.
SASAMI: Wait, Tenchi! You forgot your lunch!
TENCHI: Thank you, Sasami. What would I do without you?(Tenchi gives her a hug. Sasami blushes,
giggles and runs inside. Seion and Tenchi ride off.)
NOBOYUKI: Hey, Kiyone. If your not busy today, would you like to go fishing with me?
KIYONE: (flirting) I'd love to.
NOBOYUKI: I'll go get the gear ready then!
MIHOSHI: What about me?
KIYONE: Don't worry! Seion'll be back soon!
MIHOSHI: What'll I do until then?
SASAMI: (from the house) Mihoshi! They're showing a "MOLDIVER MARATHON" on TV!
MIHOSHI: OH GOODY! That's my favorite show! METAMORFORCE!
YOSHO: Well, I'm going into town on some errands. Would you care to join me, Nagi!
NAGI: Hmm. Seems like nothing else is going on around here. As long it's not another trick to
get me in swimsuit.
YOSHO: Don't worry. I'm just checking on the people who are going to be running booths at the
annual carnival. I'll be leaving in 30 minutes.
WASHU:(to the cabbits) Do you two wanna help me in an experiment in evolution. You look like
cute, furry people!
WASHU A: You can do it, Washu!
WASHU B: Turn the cabbits into people, Washu!
RYO-OKI: MiYaa!
KEN-OKI: CiAoooo!
WASHU: Great! Let's get started!
WASHU A: Let's start, Washu!
WASHU B: Right now, Washu!
RYOKO: Looks like everybodys having fun 'cept us princess.
AEKA: Not to worry. Our plan to make Tenchi jealous worked like a charm!
RYOKO: That's easy for you to say! You head didn't get bashed in!
AEKA: I am sorry for you. How long do you think we can keep this up.
RYOKO: Until you trick Tenchi into marrying both of us. Let's hit the bath!
AEKA: Sounds like a wonderful idea!
RYOKO: Let's get into to a fight in his bedroom while he's asleep tonight and rip each other's
clothes off! It'll be fun! HAHAHAAA!
AEKE: OH HOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOOOO!
(the camera pulls away with the two laughing their heads off and the ending music starts playing.)

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Notes:
	1. I got the name Seion from another pronouciation of the kanji's that spell Kiyone.
 	    Kiyone means pure or innocent voice. Seion means unvoiced sound. Cool, ne?
	2. I'm writing these out as scripts rather than compositions because they take up less
	    space and are faster to read. If you like it good. If you don't, suffer!
	3. If you're wondering about the music all of it is taken from Tenchi CD's ("Bouken" is
           actually from from the El-Hazard domestic CD from Pioneer (duh!). You can hear part
           of it on AIC's website. Any Tenchi fan should visit it for bits of other songs not
           yet released over here.
	4. More of Mitsuki's court-martial and it's aftermath will come later in the series.
	5. The voice actor for I picked for Seion is Tetsuya Iwanaga who played Makoto Mizuhara
in the El-Hazard Series (Yuri Amano played Ifurita in the OVA series which is the joke behind
Kiyone's dream sequence)
	"You will all pay for this! Your DEAD! Do you hear me? DEAD! DEAD! DEAD!"-Mitsuki
