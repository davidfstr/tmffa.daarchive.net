**Tenchi Muyo belongs to Pioneer entertainment and it's owners. This =
story is rated R for violence and language.



Outerspace; 10:30 a.m

A spaceship flew towards Earth quickly. On board, a man covered in =
pointy armor and a long, ripped cape looked at a hologram of a girl with =
purple hair in pigtails. She looked about six (physically) as she played =
in a garden full of daisies happily.

"Ayeka-sama. It's been a while since we saw each other," he sighed.

~~~~~

The young Ayeka played in the daisy garden happily when suddenly, a =
young boy with brown hair dressed in rags snuck into her royal garden. =
Ayeka paused and looked at him.

"H_h_hi..princess," the boy said timidly.

"Hello," Ayeka responded. Since she was about six (physically), she =
didn't know about the rule 'don't talk to strangers'. "What are you =
doing here? Are you lost?"

The boy shook his head. "I have nowhere to go. My parents are gone and I =
have no home."

Ayeka looked down sadly. "That's sad." She looked up as a woman called =
her name.

"Princess! What are you doing out here alone?!" her maid scolded. "And =
who is that boy?!"

"He says he has no home or parents!" Ayeka cried. "Please let him stay =
in the palace."

The maid looked at the boy. "I guess we need a new palace cleaner."

The boy nodded. "Okay!"

"Okay then! Let's go..uhh.," the maiden exclaimed.

"Yoshi," the boy replied.

~~~~~

14 years later...

"Where is Ayeka?" Yoshi asked the maid as he cleaned some windows.

"We don't know. They think she and Sasami escaped from Jurai!" the maid =
sobbed.

"WHAT?!" Yoshi exclaimed. He threw down his cloth and bucket then rushed =
away.

*****

The older Yoshi looked out his spaceship window. "Now that I've tracked =
you back to Earth--we'll be together, one way..or another."

**********

Ryoko sighed as she flipped through the channels on the TV. Nothing was =
on Sunday mornings!

"Starmie GGOOO!!--" "Hello Kitty--" "Thus Lina In---" "HIII-YA!--"

She finally flipped back to Pokemon and got up to the kitchen. Sasami =
shrugged and sat down to watch Pokemon. Ryo-Ohki hopped onto her head =
and meowed happily. Ayeka was in the kitchen, drinking a glass of water =
as Ryoko came in to look through the fridge.

"Hey Ayeka," Ryoko said.

"What is it?" Ayeka asked.

Ryoko pulled out a piece of cake and started to eat it. "Mmm... =
Remember..when we were little?"

"Do I," Ayeka murmured and took a sip of water--a long sip.

Ryoko finally paused from chewing and swallowed. "I remember this kid =
who always followed you around, secretly."

Ayeka blinked and pondered for a moment, "A boy followed me around?"

Ryoko nodded, "Do you remember him at all?"

"No, but I do remember this boy who became a window washer I met in the =
garden," Ayeka responded. "Why do you ask?"

Ryoko shrugged and took another bite of cake, "I dunno."

Ayeka put the empty glass in the sink and walked away silently. Ryoko =
blinked.

[Was it something I said?] she wondered.

Mihoshi hopped on to the couch with Sasami and watched Misty and Ash =
bicker over who keeps Topegy. Kiyone rolled her eyes as Mihoshi started =
to laugh with Sasami.

"Ayeka--" Kiyone started, but she watched Ayeka walk out the door =
silently. "Uhh...do you...want..to..water...the garden....nevermind."

Ryoko scratched her head and walked over to Kiyone.

"What's her problem?" Kiyone asked. "She looks sad..or angry. I couldn't =
see her face clearly."

Ryoko shrugged, "I don't know. One minute, we're talking about a boy she =
once knew, and then, she's gone."

Kiyone ohed and looked after Ayeka.

***********

Ayeka sat by Tenchi's garden and stared at the daisies, trying to =
remember the boy. She shook her head abruptly. [No. Forget about him! =
TenchiTenchiTenchi.]

Suddenly, as she touched a daisy, her hands began to fade. She shrieked =
and look down at her body which began to fade.

"UUUWWWWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"

***********

Everyone rushed out of the house at her scream.

"Ayeka!" Sasami exclaimed with Ryoko.

Everyone rushed out just in time to see Ayeka disappear.

"Look!" Kiyone exclaimed, pointing up to a large spaceship.

"Ryo-Ohki!" Ryoko exclaimed.

"Meowr! Meow!" Ryo-Ohki exclaimed and turned into the spaceship.

Tenchi looked at Kiyone and nodded who nodded back. Then, the crew =
rushed inside Ryo-Ohki.

**********

Ayeka looked around her new surroundings. She was in a large room inside =
a spaceship which was quickly flying high over the Masaki Shrine. =
Looking for a way out, she discovered the doors were bolted shut with =
large, iron clamps.

"Damn," Ayeka murmured. She looked around. "Show yourself!"

A large screen rolled out infront of her on the wall to show Yoshi's =
grinning face.

"You're mine, princess," he said.

Ayeka stared at him for a long time. The garden...that...boy...the =
window washer...

"Yoshi?!" Ayeka gasped. "But how--?!"

Yoshi laughed, "My origin is odd. When I was two, I stumbled into a =
magical waterfall which enabled a person to live forever. Of course, my =
parents grew old, surprised that I never grew a day older. When I met =
you, I was 78 years old. Now, as you guess, I'm 778 years old."

Ayeka blinked and asked, "Why do you want me so?"

Yoshi laughed, "Don't you see, princess? I was in love with you ever =
since we met!"

BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. The ship buzzed as red lights flashed through the =
ship.

"INTRUDERS. INTRUDERS. WE ARE BEING FOLLOWED." the ship's voice =
exclaimed.

Ayeka grinned as Yoshi cursed.

"My friends will follow you until they get me back home," Ayeka =
chuckled. "And I never could love you."

Yoshi grinned evilly, "Oh, you will. One way or another."

Suddenly, a bright purple gas filled the room. Ayeka gasped and listened =
to Yoshi's insane laughter fill the room. She coughed and covered her =
mouth as her large, pink eyes teared, eventually falling onto her knees. =


"I will never give into you! *cough* Damn you Yoshi...D_damn you.....," =
she murmured as she slipped to the floor, greeting something called =
darkness.

**********

Tenchi looked out the window to the enemy ship. Suddenly, an image of a =
unconscious Ayeka flashed in his mind. He held his head as beads of =
sweat rolled down his face.

"Tenchi?" Sasami asked behind him. "What's wrong?"

Ryoko's ears perked up. "Tenchi?"

Tenchi ignored their pleas and rushed up to Ryoko. "Can't Ryo-Ohki go =
any faster?"

Ryoko nodded and grinned evilly, "You want fast?"

Tenchi nodded.

Ryoko shrugged, "Ooooookaaaayyy....."

"Meowr! Meowr!" Ryo-Ohki howled.

FFFFWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOMMMMM!!

The spaceship flew off at amazing speed, sending everyone but Ryoko =
towards the back of the ship.

"RRRYYYYYOOOOOOOKKKKKOOOOOOO!!!!!!" Sasami and Mihoshi screamed as the =
spaceship closed in on Yoshi's.

"Hold on!" Ryoko ordered.

Suddenly, Yoshi's ship faded from site.

"What the hell?!" Ryoko gasped. "Damn. They must've used a dimensional =
portal to another universe!"

Washu pried herself off the wall as Ryo-Ohki slowed down. "It's a =
possibility. We'll use one ourselves."

Ryoko looked confused, "Ryo-Ohki can't do that!"

Washu smiled insanely, "But I can."

**********

Her eyes felt like they were weighted. As she tried her best to open =
them, it only proved to be more and more frustrating. Finally, she =
managed to open them slowly as a bright light stung them painfully. A =
moan escaped her lips as Yoshi's face came into view.

"Hello," he said.

Ayeka blinked and straightened up a little. She looked down at herself, =
finding out she was dressed in a long, white dress and a pair of glass =
wings on her back. This suit she wore looked like the dress and wings =
the Goddess of Jurai wore in fairytales.

"Yoshi..," she could only murmur. "Why.....?"

Yoshi laughed, "It's the best for you." He picked her up in his arms and =
walked over to a long hallway.

Ayeka tried to struggle, but she felt too weak and tired.

"You drugged me, didn't..you?" Ayeka murmured as her eyes half closed. =
"That..gas..wasn't enough."

Yoshi nodded, "I wanted you out for a while."

Ayeka watched as he placed her on a bed in another room. Her =
surroundings blurred, then cleared. It was a small room with a large bed =
covered in red and pink covers. The walls were light pink and the carpet =
was red. He placed her on the bed and covered her in the blankets. Her =
eyes were closing on her as he walked out, leaving the door open. =
Finally, they closed, and the princess of Jurai fell into an unnatural =
sleep.

**********

Sasami silently pouted for her sister in a far off corner as Kiyone and =
Mihoshi comforted her. Washu typed furiously on Ryo-Ohki's computer.

"If I could just--" she started. She paused as a whirring sound buzzed. =
Washu laughed as a portal opened up infront of her, "Yes!"

Tenchi exclaimed, "All right Washu!"

Ryoko grinned, "Let's go."

**********

Yoshi watched the princess sleep quietly for about ten minutes, then he =
woke her up. Her eyes opened slowly. They looked foggy and tired. Yoshi =
touched her cheek gently, but she snapped at him quickly. He pulled back =
his hand and slapped her across the face harshly. Her eyes teared in =
pain, but she kept a straight face.

"I don't know what your real intentions are with me, but I won't stick =
around to find out!" Ayeka snapped. "Seal him up!"

Nothing happend.

"What?!" Ayeka gasped. "The magical shield..."

Yoshi laughed, "You cannot work them in here."

"Bastard!" Ayeka snapped.

Yoshi frowned and held out his hand. A wave of black energy shot out, =
hurtling Ayeka against the wall. He put down his hand as she slid down =
to the floor, bleeding from the head and mouth. She snarled at him as =
her red blood flowed down her forehead and face.

"You were always so stubborn. But all that will change," he said calmly. =


Ayeka wiped the blood away from her mouth and snapped, "How will you do =
that?!"

He chuckled as an extra eye on his hand opened up. He held down Ayeka =
with his free hand and placed his extra eye on her forehead.

"I will never give into you! NEVER!!" she screamed and struggled.

Suddenly, his hand glowed yellow as small rays of light shot out of his =
extra eye into her head. Her struggling decreased as her eyes turned =
completely white.

[Sasami.... Tenchi...... So sorry....] she thought as tears rolled down =
her face.

Yoshi frowned as the light glowed more brightly. Soon, Ayeka blinked and =
the tears stopped.

"I love you," Ayeka murmured. "Yoshi, be mine..forever."

Yoshi smiled to himself. "That's more like it."

**********

Washu looked out the window to see the enemy ship. "Look. The =
ship..stopped?"

Ryoko clenched a fist, "I don't like this. Why would he stop?"

"Meowr...," Ryo-Ohki meowed.

Ryoko nodded, "Yeah. We have to check it out."

Tenchi and the others nodded, "Right."

Ryo-Ohki pulled up by the ship. Ryoko blew a hole into the side and they =
stepped in. After walking down the hall, they spotted a silent and =
slender figure walking down a hall just ahead of them. It's long, purple =
hair trailed behind it, dragging slightly on the ground. Ryoko and the =
others instantly recognized her.

"Ayeka!" Sasami called.

Ayeka stopped, silent as Sasami giggled and rushed over to her. Sasami =
stopped giggling, noticing how silent she was.

"Ayeka? Why do you have wings on?" Sasami asked. She giggled. "You look =
like the Goddess of Jurai in the fairytales mother use to tell us!"

Silence.

"Ayeka?" Ryoko asked, walking right past a confused Sasami. "Dammit, =
Ayeka! Answer us! Answer your sister!" She grabbed Ayeka's shoulder =
which was bare because of the dress she wore and turned her around. "Oh =
my---"

Sasami gasped as her face turned blue, shaking her head. She rushed =
behind Tenchi and the others who all look as dumbfounded as Ryoko. =
Ayeka's eyes were glazed white, and to Ryoko's judgment....sad.

"Ayeka!" Mihoshi exclaimed. "What? Where are you going?"

"To my love," Ayeka murmured in a robotic-like voice.

Tenchi gasped, "What?!"

Ayeka nodded, tears streaming down her eyes, but she wasn't sobbing or =
sniffing, it was like she was crying on the inside. "Yoshi is my love. =
You are intruders."

"No, Ayeka!" Sasami sobbed. "It's me! Your sister! Sasami!" she pointed =
to everyone as she said their names. "Remember Kiyone? Miss Washu? =
Mihoshi? Ryoko? Tenchi?"

Ayeka stared at the crying girl coldly. Washu shivered. Ayeka could be =
mean, but this was evil mean. Besides. What happend to her large, warm, =
eyes? Could it be..brainwash?

"Ayeka. You were brainwashed," Washu said seriously. "You must come with =
us."

Ryoko nodded, "Good idea. Come on Ayeka." She reached to grab Ayeka, but =
she floated in the air.

"You are intruders," she repeated.

Ryoko flew after her, trying to grab her, but Ayeka formed a light =
energy ball in her hand. Ryoko smirked, her energy balls were weak, but =
could sting--a little. Ayeka's ball grew larger and brighter, so bright =
that everyone else had to shade their eyes.

"You are intruders. You all must die," she whispered, the tears flowing =
faster and larger. "DIE!"

Ryoko yelped as Ayeka's ball exploded infront of her, sending her flying =
back, crashing into Mihoshi and Kiyone.

"Damn...," Ryoko murmured in pain.

Ayeka's laugh echoed through the hall, "Oh ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! That was =
my weakest one! Yoshi loves me! He taught me that I was alone before he =
found me!"

Tenchi stepped forward, "Ayeka! That's not true! It's me, Tenchi! Can't =
you remember anything?!"

Ayeka paused. "Who is Tenchi? I know no Tenchi! I want no Tenchi! I need =
no Tenchi! You are intru---hey!!"

Kiyone grinned as her rope wrapped around her body. "You're coming back =
with us, Ayeka. To your home where everyone loves you."

"Lies! Lies! You know that isn't true! *I* know that isn't true!" Ayeka =
screamed, tears still flowing.

Ryoko gasped.

~~~~~~

"She also ate 12 cookies too! What a pig, huh?" Ryoko told Tenchi, =
tracing a circle on his chest with her finger.

"Lies! Lies! You know that isn't TRRUUUEE!!!" Ayeka cried while shaking =
her head.

~~~~~

"Oh, the truth hurts, huh? Oh! Just like one of the family!" Ryoko =
teased Ayeka.

"Lies! Lies! You know that isn't trrrrrrruuuueeeeeGRRR!!" Ayeka =
exclaimed, shaking her head.

*****

Ryoko snapped out of her memories. [She always says that. But this =
time..]

Ayeka's body glowed white as she snapped Kiyone's light rope off of =
herself.

"NO ONE BUT YOSHI LOVES ME!!" she screamed.

She stuck out her hand and blasted everyone to the floor with an energy =
ball.

"Ayeka...," Sasami murmured in pain.

Suddenly, Yoshi appeared behind her. "Ayeka-sama. You are so brave. Now, =
wipe those tears away and let me handle this, my love."

Ayeka snuggled up into his chest. "Oh Yoshi." The tears still flowed, no =
matter how hard she tried to wipe them away.

Everyone got up and gasped.

He touched her shoulders and planted a long kiss on her head, his green =
eyes looking at the upset and dumbfounded crew in an evil like way. She =
licked his cheek and walked back to her room with her glass wings =
glowing in the light.

"You brainwashed her, didn't you?" Washu accused. "Bastard."

Yoshi laughed and said, "Yes. You have caught me. Actually, she does =
make a beautiful puppet."

Tenchi growled, forming the Light Hawk sword in his hands, "Leave my =
friends alone!!"

Yoshi raised an eyebrow, "Ooh, another Juraian, yes? All right, this =
will be an easy battle."

Sasami cried loudly into Mihoshi. She angrily turned to Yoshi and =
exclaimed, "Ayeka is so cold! Evil just like you! She doesn't really =
love you! Poor Ayeka was crying!"

Mihoshi agreed, "That's right you big meanie! There are plenty of fish =
in the sea!"

Kiyone rolled her eyes and pulled out her gun. "Fool. Just shut up and =
get your gun out."

Mihoshi whined as she pulled out her gun, "Oooh...Kiiiiii-yoooooneeeee." =


Yoshi laughed, "You girls are no doubt from the Galaxy Police! Ooh, I'm =
*really* scared now! Bwah-hahaha!"

"Yeeeeeaaaaaaaa!!" Tenchi exclaimed, running towards Yoshi with his =
sword ready.

Yoshi disappeared into thin air as everyone gasped and looked around. He =
reappeared behind Sasami and kicked her down the hall Ayeka went back =
to. Sasami screamed as she skidded to a hault by a tall figure.

"Hey! Child Abuse is a Class B injust!" Kiyone exclaimed.

She and Mihoshi fired at Yoshi. Two bullets at once grazed his arm.

"Damn!" he yelped. "I hate being shot at!"

Tenchi turned his attention to Sasami. He gasped as Ayeka looked down at =
her with her large, pink eyes tearing at the sight. Everyone else paused =
in silence as they watched Ayeka and Sasami. Ayeka slowly leaned down to =
Sasami and picked her up, her eyes still flowing with tears as she =
sobbed quietly.

"Sasami.. I'm...so sorry," Ayeka murmured.

"Ayeka...you're...back. I love you," Sasami responded with her eyes =
still closed.

"I love you too," Ayeka sobbed.

Sasami groggily looked up at Ayeka and wrapped her arms around her neck. =
Ayeka fell to her knees and started to cry with Sasami. Tenchi motioned =
Ayeka who looked up at him sadly to go into her room. She nodded and =
rushed into her room with Sasami in her arms. Yoshi saw the whole thing. =


"Damn that girl!" he fumed and disappeared.

Tenchi and Ryoko rushed to Ayeka's room just in time to see Yoshi kick =
her into the wall as Sasami yelled out her name. Ayeka's wound from =
before reopened and blood streamed down her face again. She clutched her =
stomache and coughed up blood from the hard blow.

"Ayeka means frail," Yoshi laughed, walking up to Ayeka slowly. "So I =
can kill you easily."

"NOO!" Ryoko screamed and chucked a fire lance through Yoshi.

The lance sliced through Yoshi, and her fell to the floor, eyes rolled =
up in his head. Ayeka watched painfully and then laid back in pain. Her =
wings were half shattered from the wall, so the pieces of glass were =
stuck into her back.

"Tenchi..Ryoko..he..isn't dead," Ayeka murmured. "I know it. He's a =
monster in disguise."

Ryoko and Tenchi leaned by her with Sasami.

"No, he's good as gone," Ryoko replied.

Ayeka clenched her teeth. "Ryoko..I remember what I did.. I'm sorry."

Suddenly, her eyes grew large in fear. She pointed behind Tenchi just in =
time to be swiped into the wall again by a large, black hand. Ayeka slid =
to the ground, bleeding from all over.

Ryoko and Tenchi turned around angrily. There, before them, Yoshi had =
turned into a large, shapeless, black monster.

"Ryoko! Get Ayeka and the others out of here!" Tenchi ordered.

Ayeka woke up slightly just in time to see Ryoko get swiped by the =
monster along with Tenchi and Sasami. She got up, wobbling slightly and =
stumbled over to Yoshi.

"Yoshi! It's me you want! Kill me if that is your wish!" Ayeka =
exclaimed.

Yoshi grinned, "After all the trouble you caused me, I would love to!"

Ayeka faced him boldly as he raised an arm to hit her. But to her shock, =
the arms suddenly sprang out with spikes all over it. Tenchi recovered =
just in time to see Ayeka go flying across the room and smashed against =
the wall. Blood spilt all over the wall as she slid down slowly, dying. =
Yoshi laughed.

"Foolish girl! Now I will take your soul and make me live another 1,000 =
years!" Yoshi laughed.

Sasami saw her sister and screamed. That scream was heard on Earth where =
the people looked up in awe. That scream was heard by the others who =
rushed to help. That scream was the last thing Yoshi would ever hear.

"BASTARD!!!!" Tenchi screamed and sliced Yoshi in half, purple blood =
spilling all over as Yoshi groaned.

Ayeka coughed as Washu and the others rushed over to her. She coughed =
again and then she was silent, her white dress torn and tattered and her =
glass wings broken in pieces in her back.

"Ayeka! Ayeka!" Sasami pleaded, tears streaming down her face.

Ayeka opened her eyes to look at her sister. "Sasami.. You're still so =
young..so...pretty...nevermind me...no one needs me. I'm nothing..but..a =
weak....royal pain."

Tenchi took her hand which was dripping with blood. "We all love you, =
Ayeka. Please try to hold on."

Ayeka nodded then she slipped unconscious slowly as Ryoko stood up =
sadly.

"I_I don't know what to say. She saved us," Ryoko murmured, trying to =
hold back her tears. "She used her own body so that we could finish him =
off."

Kiyone felt for a pulse on Ayeka. "She's still alive, but hardly. Let's =
bring her back home."

~~~~~~~~~~

"Princess Ayeka. I have finished your windows," a young Yoshi said.

Ayeka walked up to him and smiled after inspecting her windows, "You did =
a very good job."

Yoshi blushed. "Um..thank you."

Ayeka nodded and walked off. Suddenly, Sasami ran into the room.

"Ayeka! Ayeka! Father wants to see you!" Sasami exclaimed.

"Now Sasami. You know we cannot yell that loud in the palace," Ayeka =
scolded.

Sasami covered her mouth quickly and blushed guiltily. "I'm sorry."

Ayeka smiled and patted her younger sister on the head. "It's okay. =
You're still so young and happy. Just don't yell around father."

Sasami smiled and nodded happily. "Follow me!"

Sasami rushed off as Ayeka walked after her young and active sister, =
chuckling to herself.

"Hurry up you slowpoke!" Sasami laughed.

Yoshi smiled as he watched Ayeka roll her eyes and laugh. He looked as a =
maid walked by him with some flowers.

"What are those flowers for, miss?" he asked.

The maid looked surprised. "Don't you know?" Yoshi shook his head. "The =
Emperor wants Princess Ayeka to get married!"

Yoshi's mouth hung open in shock. "What?!"

The maid giggled at his reaction and walked off.

~~~~~~~~~~

"Miss Washu, there has to be something we can do!" Sasami begged Washu =
in her lab.

Washu sighed, "We have to wait and see what happens. Right now, we have =
to watch Ayeka closely."

Sasami sighed and looked down sadly. "This wouldn't happen if I hadn't =
let Yoshi build a ship for himself against my father's wishes."

Washu looked confused. "Wow. You had that much power?"

Sasami explained, "Ayeka was planning our escape off Jurai.."

~~~~~

Ayeka paced back and forth in her room. Sasami watched her with worry.

"We have to escape by ship," Ayeka concluded. "I do not know much about =
spaceships, but my friend can help us with this. Are you sure you want =
to go, Sasami?"

Sasami nodded, "I have this strong feeling I should go!"

Ayeka smiled and nodded, "Maybe this could be our path to our destiny, =
who knows." She touched Sasami's shoulder. "But don't worry, we'll be =
back one day."

Sasami nodded happily. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

"Come in," Ayeka called.

Yoshi appeared in the doorway as the door opened.

"The ship is ready to go!" he exclaimed happily. "But I want to get off =
this planet too, you know."

Sasami and Ayeka exchanged glances.

"I'm sorry, Yoshi. But then my parents would think you kidnapped us," =
Ayeka said.

Yoshi shook his head, "No. I'll build my own ship and leave a note or =
tell a maid that I'm running away. I'll disappear after you two are =
found missing."

Sasami looked at Ayeka. "Okay."

"What?" Ayeka gasped. "Sasami, do you think this is wise?"

"Ayeka, he's a window washer. If I was a window washer, I know I would =
love to leave," Sasami said.

Ayeka pondered that thought for a moment. "Yes, that is a good reason. =
Okay Yoshi. You have permission."

~~~~~

Washu nodded. "No wonder Ayeka looked upset before. She was thinking =
about what happend to him, right?"

Sasami nodded.

**********

Tenchi paced by Ayeka's door. Nobody was allowed to go in and disturb =
her, but Washu said they could peek in to see if she was okay.

[Please be okay.] he thought. [Ayeka, I never saw you look so brave =
before.]

~~~~~

Tenchi groaned as he smashed into Ryoko after the hard blow. [I have to =
get up! Come ooonnnn Tenchi!]

"Yoshi! It's me you want! Kill me if that is your wish!" he heard Ayeka =
exclaimed.

Yoshi replied, "After all the trouble you caused me, I would love to!"

Tenchi heard a gut-wrenching splat and realized it was Ayeka. He looked =
up over Sasami's head and saw the large, bloody spikes on Yoshi's hand, =
then he saw Ayeka hit the wall with her blood forming a trail behind her =
as she slid down. To his shock, her whole body went limp on the floor =
and her skin turned ghostly white. He got up quickly with Sasami and =
realized if she hadn't done that, Yoshi would've probably finished them =
off!

~~~~~

Tenchi plopped onto the floor abruptly and hit his head against the door =
of Ayeka's room.

"I should've gotten up! I could've saved her!" Tenchi moaned.

"Tenchi?" Ryoko asked from above.

Tenchi looked up to see Ryoko on one of the roof beams. Her face was =
shadowed so he couldn't make out if she was sad or happy that Ayeka =
could be dead by tomorrow.

"Ryoko?" he responded, getting up to look up at the woman.

Ryoko didn't respond, only sniffed as a tear fell from the ceiling. =
Tenchi gasped.

"Ryoko, are you crying?" he asked consernly.

Ryoko quickly wiped away her tears and lied, "No."

Tenchi smiled, "Come on down, Ryoko. You don't----Ooof!"

Ryoko landed on Tenchi, knocking him down to the floor.

"Tenchi, I'm just worried," Ryoko sniffed.

Tenchi nodded and got Ryoko off of him. "I was going to check on her."

Ryoko nodded, "Me too. I just didn't want you to see me cry." Ryoko =
blushed at the word cry.

Tenchi nodded and opened Ayeka's door. Ayeka was sleeping, breathing =
softly but just barely every minute. Tenchi frowned and watched her for =
a long time with Ryoko.

"Tenchi?" Mihoshi asked behind them.

Tenchi and Ryoko turned to Mihoshi who stood beside Kiyone and Yosho.

"How is she?" Kiyone asked.

Tenchi sighed and closed the door softly. "It looks like she's in deep =
pain."

Kiyone nodded sadly with Yosho.

"I heard the whole story from Washu before. Sasami must be really sad =
right now," Yosho said.

"I'll check on her," Ryoko said.

"Thank you Ryoko," Tenchi replied.

Kiyone nodded with Yosho as Ryoko walked off to find Sasami. Tenchi =
sighed and leaned against the door.

"I wish Washu would let us go in there," sighed Mihoshi. "I want to give =
her something to drink."

Kiyone and Tenchi tripped to the floor. Yosho shook his head and sighed. =


"Mihoshi, I'm afraid she won't be awake for a while," Yosho sighed.

Mihoshi looked down sadly. "Oh."

Kiyone got up with Tenchi and said, "Hey, maybe one of us should go in =
there to get a closer look at Ayeka."

Tenchi sighed. "I'll do it."

Kiyone, Mihoshi and Yosho looked at him.

"Yes, go ahead Tenchi," Yosho said gently with a smile. "But don't =
disturb her."

"Right," Tenchi responded with a nod.

He opened the door and snuck in quietly, closing the door behind him. =
Tenchi looked at Ayeka and walked over to her side. Her eyes squinted =
but rested again as soon as Tenchi leaned down by her.

"Miss Ayeka, I should've protected you. I'm sorry. When you said that =
nobody cared for you, I was shocked. I love you..and so does everyone =
else. Even Ryoko. So,----Ayeka?" Tenchi started.

Ayeka's skin was ghost white and her breathing stopped. Tenchi's mind =
raced.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!! SHE'S DEAD! GOD HELP HER!!" Tenchi exclaimed.

Everyone suddenly rushed in as Tenchi pressed down on her stomache over =
and over. Nothing. Ryoko pushed him aside and gave her mouth to mouth, =
then pressed on her stomache ten times. Nothing. Sasami rushed over with =
tears flowing down her face. She hit her sister's stomache over and =
over.

"Ayeka! You can't go! Ayeka!!" she screamed. "What about your promise?! =
Your promise you made to me!"

She hit her stomache once more and then fell onto her body, crying. =
Everyone watched with tears in their eyes, shaking their heads sadly.

"D_don't scream......in the.....palace...," Ayeka murmured suddenly.

"Ayeka?!" Sasami exclaimed happily.

Ayeka opened her eyes as the color of her skin started to come back. =
"Sasami..."

Sasami squeezed her sister so tight, that her eyes almost burst out of =
her skull.

"Sasami.. My..ribs," she moaned.

Sasami let go, forgetting about her wounds. Ayeka sat up a little and =
coughed a few times.

"Ayeka!" Mihoshi exclaimed. "You're okay!"

Kiyone and the others laughed happily in relief.

"What promise were you talking about Sasami?" Ryoko asked.

Ayeka smiled and settled back down in her bed. "Sasami made me promise =
that we would bake a Christmas Feast together. Although, it is a little =
too early to worry about it."

Sasami blushed, "You also promised me we would always be together, =
remember?"

~~~~~

Before they stepped into the ship to make their get-away, Sasami tugged =
on Ayeka's rob.

"Yes Sasami, what is it?" Ayeka asked.

"Ayeka, would you ever leave me?" Sasami asked.

Ayeka smiled and leaned down by her sister, "I would never leave you =
anywhere."

Sasami eyed her, "Is that a promise?"

"We'll always be together, Sasami, that is a promise," Ayeka replied.

**********

A couple of weeks later, Ayeka was able to walk around the house. Of =
course this didn't mean alone. Every minute, Sasami or any other person =
nearby would refuse her to do anything by herself.

"Ayeka," Tenchi called one day as she wondered to the garden. "You =
shouldn't be out here alone."

"I'm fine," Ayeka sighed, rolling her eyes.

Tenchi sat on the porch and watched her walk to the garden full of =
daisies and stare at it for a long time. Finally he got up and hugged =
her around the waist, causing Ayeka to blush.

"I was so worried about you," Tenchi said.

Ayeka blushed and stuttered, "I_I_I knew you would come for me."

Tenchi nodded, "We would never abandon you, and that's my promise."

They kissed gently as Ryoko walked out. She turned around and rolled her =
eyes.

"I need some more sake."

The End
