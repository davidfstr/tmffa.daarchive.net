"Trip Through Time, Part One"

TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. Ayeka's bedroom – DAY (Monday, 15 June 1998; 14th Day, 4th Month)

>From left to right lie Sasami, Ryoko, Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryo-Ohki.

All are in bed under the sheets.

Tenchi opens his eyes.

He looks left and right at the sleeping girls.

He slowly works his way out of bed with out waking them.

Tenchi gets dressed and leaves the room.

INT. Kitchen – DAY

Tenchi enters the kitchen.

He starts preparing breakfast.

Kazuhiko enters the kitchen

KAZUHIKO
Good morning Tenchi.

TENCHI
Good morning Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
Are you going to grace us with your cooking this morning?

Tenchi chuckles.

TENCHI
Well, I'm going to try.

KAZUHIKO
Do you mind if I help?

TENCHI
No, not at all.

Kazuhiko joins Tenchi in preparing breakfast.

KAZUHIKO
How did your anniversary go yesterday?

TENCHI
Almost perfect.

KAZUHIKO
Almost?

TENCHI
I tried to ask Sasami to be my third wife.  She wouldn't let me ask her.
I think she's afraid that I won't accept her for what she is.

KAZUHIKO
And what is she?

Tenchi stops working and leans against the counter.

TENCHI
She's the future Empress of the universe.  She has the memories of
a goddess.  She has the power of Jurai.  She can generate five wings
of the light hawk.  She can heal the injured.

Tenchi pauses.

Kazuhiko waits for him to continue.

TENCHI
Most of all she's one of the three people I love most in this world.

Kazuhiko nods his head.

KAZUHIKO
I believe you'll ask her for all the right reasons.  I take it Ayeka
and Ryoko have agreed to this.

Tenchi nods his head.

KAZUHIKO
When will you ask her?

TENCHI
At dinner tonight.

KAZUHIKO
If you don't mind I'll make tonight's dinner.  I'll have to go to town.
Do you want me to pick up anything?

TENCHI
I'd like some chocolates.  Make sure they don't have any nuts.

KAZUHIKO
Check, chocolates without nuts.

Both return to preparing breakfast.

TENCHI
So, what's up between you and Mihoshi?

Kazuhiko stops what he's doing and leans against the counter.

KAZUHIKO
I'm not sure.

TENCHI
Well, how do you feel about her?

KAZUHIKO
I'm sorry Tenchi, but I think she's the prettiest girl in the house.

Tenchi stops working and looks at Kazuhiko.

TENCHI
I understand; her beauty goes far beyond skin deep.  She hates no one.
I thought I was like that until the Furrarizan attacked.
 
KAZUHIKO
She's tough as nails, yet she puts everyone before herself.  She never
flinched when we went to rescue Kiyone.   When she saw the house she
broke down in tears.

Tenchi returns to preparing breakfast.

TENCHI
So have you told her?

KAZUHIKO
That I like her and want to stay with her, many times.  That I think
I love her, no.

TENCHI
Why not?

KAZUHIKO
There's so much about her that's a mystery.  There's plenty of room for
people in her life, but I don't know if she could dedicate herself to
just one.

TENCHI
I think you should let her know your feelings.  Of course who am I to
talk?  It took me two years to figure that out.

Kazuhiko returns to helping Tenchi prepare breakfast.

END TEASER.



ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Family room – DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi, and Kiyone sit watching soap
operas.

Tenchi, Yoshou, Kazuhiko, and Tsunami sit at the table playing Mah Jongg.

The television program ends.

WASHU
Okay everyone, it's exam time!

A yellow globe appears in Washu's hand.

A collective groan from her audience, except for Mihoshi, who claps her
hands.

WASHU
You first Ayeka.

Washu sets the globe on Ayeka's head.

She watches her holographic keyboard for the results.

WASHU
Oh my!

Ayeka's eyes go wide.

Sasami stands with concern on her face.

SASAMI
Is there something wrong?

Washu waves at Sasami.

WASHU
You can sit back down Sasami.  Everything is just fine.  I was surprised
at how well you did the healing.  I declare Ayeka fully recovered.

Washu takes the globe from Ayeka.

WASHU
I'll examine you next Sasami.

She moves over to Sasami and places the globe on Sasami's head.

Washu glances at her keyboard.

WASHU
Very interesting.

Washu bends low to look at Sasami's body.

SASAMI
What's so interesting?

Washu pokes Sasami in the breast.

WASHU
You've developed far more than Tsunami predicted.

Sasami turns bright red as her eyes go wide in shock.

Washu lets loose an evil cackle.

She takes the globe and moves over to Ryoko.

RYOKO
You had best not say anything about anything sagging.

Washu sets the globe on Ryoko's head.

WASHU
My little Ryoko.  I wouldn't say that.  You've done a much better job
of keeping up your looks since you got married.

Ryoko blushes.

Washu taps a few commands on the keyboard.

WASHU
You've adapted well to having all three gems again.

Washu takes the globe and looks at Kiyone.

WASHU
Would you mind Kiyone?

KIYONE
No you can go ahead and examine me.

Washu sets the globe on Kiyone's head.

She watches the keyboard.

WASHU
Your body has fully recovered Kiyone.  How are you feeling?

Kiyone looks around the room.

WASHU
You're with people that love you Kiyone.  If you like you can stop in
and see me anytime.

KIYONE
Thank you Ms. Washu.  I still need some more time.

Washu takes the globe and moves over to the table.

WASHU
You're next Kazuhiko.

Washu sets the globe on Kazuhiko's head.

She takes a quick glance at the laptop.

WASHU
Well none of our bad habits have appeared in you. 

Washu gives her evil laugh.

WASHU
Yet.

KAZUHIKO
I guess I should be happy about that.

Washu takes the globe and looks at Tenchi.

Tenchi looks back.

Washu smiles at him.

Tenchi sighs and starts to unbutton his shirt.

WASHU
I'll let you keep your clothes on this time Tenchi.

Tenchi blushes.

Washu set the globe on his head.

TENCHI
That's very kind of you Little Washu.

Washu types a few commands.

WASHU
Do you sense the Light Hawk Wings now?

TENCHI
I can summon them up at will.

Yoshou looks at his grandson.

WASHU
Hum.  I see, okay.  I believe I'll do a private examination for you
Yoshou.

Washu takes the globe off Tenchi's head.

YOSHOU
Very well Washu, but not until after Tenchi's sword practice.
We haven't practiced in a long time.

WASHU
Do you mind if I watch?

TENCHI
You've never been interested in my practice before?

WASHU
My sweet Tenchi, who said I wanted to watch you practice.

Tenchi's eyes go wide as he turns red.

Yoshou smiles.

YOSHOU
I'd be honored if you observed our practice.

WASHU
Well that's it for exam time.  Thank you everyone.

Mihoshi starts crying.

MIHOSHI
What about me?

WASHU
No way in hell am I letting you near any of my equipment.

Mihoshi's tears turn into a river.

TENCHI
Little Washu that wasn't a very nice thing to say.

WASHU
It's true.  She destroys everything she touches.

MIHOSHI
I'm sorry.

Tenchi walks over to stand behind Mihoshi.

He places his hands on her shoulders.

TENCHI
Mihoshi put your hands under your legs.

Mihoshi sniffs a few times and places her hands under her legs.

TENCHI
Now close your eyes and stay very still.

MIHOSHI
Okay.

TENCHI
Now Little Washu, you should be able to examine her with no problems.

Washu shakes her head.

WASHU
This is a very bad idea.

TENCHI
What's the matter is your equipment so shoddy that you can't examine her?

Washu glares at Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles and moves away from Mihoshi.

Washu walks over to Mihoshi.

She slowly moves up behind her.

Washu moves the globe around Mihoshi's head.

Mihoshi stays perfectly still.

Leaning back with her arms extended Washu slowly lowers the globe.

The globe touches Mihoshi's hair.

It explodes.

The smoke clears.

Washu still has her arms extended.

She is covered in soot from the waist up.

Her hair is blown straight back.

Mihoshi is covered in soot.

Her ribbon is in tatters, and her hair is blown straight down.

MIHOSHI
Ow!

Mihoshi falls to the floor.

Washu turns and staggers toward her lab.

Grandfather stands only to have Tsunami hold him back.

Tenchi and Kazuhiko rush over to Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Ow.

Kazuhiko picks up Mihoshi and places her on the couch.

TENCHI
Sasami, please take care of Mihoshi.  I am going to check on Little
Washu.

Tenchi leaves the room.

Kazuhiko remains kneeling beside Mihoshi.

Sasami comes over and lays her hands on Mihoshi's face.

INT. Area in front of Washu's lab door – DAY

Tenchi enters the scene.

He pushes on the door and it opens to his hand.

Tenchi enters the lab.

INT. Washu's lab – DAY

Washu sits on her floating pillow.

Her head is lowered into her hands.

Her shoulders shake with her sobs.

The crab alarm sounds.

Tenchi enters the scene and walks up behind Washu.

He takes a hold of her shoulders.

TENCHI
I'm sorry Little Washu.

WASHU
Why Tenchi, why?

Washu turns to face Tenchi.

Tears have left streaks in the soot covering her face.

TENCHI
I only wanted to be fair to Mihoshi.

WASHU
No, not that.  Why is it every time I try to examine Mihoshi my
equipment blows up.  Every time!  

TENCHI
I didn't know Little Washu.  You've never examined Mihoshi?

WASHU
Never.

Tenchi
Maybe you are looking at the problem from the wrong end?

Washu suddenly lifts her head.

WASHU
Of course!

Washu jumps to her feet.

A portal opens in front of her.

WASHU
Thank you Tenchi.

Washu walks through the portal.

It disappears behind her.

TENCHI
Ah, you're welcome Little Washu.

Tenchi turns around and leaves the lab.

INT. Family room – DAY

Mihoshi is sitting on the couch.

Kazuhiko kneels beside her.

He is using a cloth to clean Mihoshi's face.

Kiyone sits next to Mihoshi, holding her hand.

Sasami sits on the other couch with Ryoko and Ayeka.

Yoshou and Tsunami still sit at the gaming table.

YOSHOU
How is Washu?

TENCHI
She's fine.  How's Mihoshi

MIHOSHI
I'll be okay Tenchi.  I'm sorry I broke Ms. Washu's machine.

TENCHI
It's not your fault Mihoshi.

Mihoshi begins to cry again.

MIHOSHI
I'm always breaking her things.

TENCHI
Little Washu is working on fixing that right now.  She should figure
it out in no time.

Kazuhiko stands.

KIYONE
Don't cry Mihoshi.  This isn't your fault.

Mihoshi hugs Kiyone.

She stops crying.

MIHOSHI
Thank you.

KAZUHIKO
I still have to go shopping.  Anyone want to go with me?

SASAMI
I'd like to go.  There are some specialty items I want to buy.

KAZUHIKO
Okay Sasami.  Just remember I'm making dinner tonight.

Sasami smiles.

KAZUHIKO
Anyone else want to go?

Kazuhiko receives no response.

KAZUHIKO
We'll be back in about an hour.

Kazuhiko and Sasami depart the room.

EXT. Carport – DAY

Sasami and Kazuhiko enter the scene.

SASAMI
Are you going to let me drive?

Kazuhiko looks at Sasami.

Sasami wears a determined look on her face.

KAZUHIKO
Sure.

Kazuhiko tosses the keys to Sasami.

She catches them.

SASAMI
Thank you.

Both get in the car.

KAZUHIKO
How long have you been driving?

SASAMI
Since we got back.  I haven't gotten my license yet, but they said
I could drive with a licensed adult.

KAZUHIKO
Oh, I see.  I guess I qualify as one of those.

Sasami starts the car.

She backs out of the carport.

The car drives out of the scene.

INT. Car – DAY

Viewed from the front of the car Sasami sits on the left side in the
drivers seat.

Kazuhiko sits on the right side.

Sasami glances over at Kazuhiko.

Kazuhiko is deep in thought.

SASAMI
What are you thinking about Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
Many things Sasami.

SASAMI
About me or about Mihoshi?

Kazuhiko focuses his attention on Sasami.

KAZUHIKO
Both.  You know a lot about people, don't you Sasami?

SASAMI
Yes, but I try to keep their secrets.

KAZUHIKO
I like to think of Tenchi as my friend.

SASAMI
Yes.

KAZUHIKO
I worry about him.  I don't want to see him getting hurt.

SASAMI
Are you afraid I might hurt him?

KAZUHIKO
No.  I'm afraid that he might hurt you, and that would hurt him deeply.
He told me about last night.

Sasami turns red.

KAZUHIKO
Just that you wouldn't let him ask you to marry him.

SASAMI
Oh.

KAZUHIKO
I think he understands what concerns you.  I'll tell you right now that
he loves you for what you are, and I mean all of what you are.

Sasami remains silent, focused on her driving.

KAZUHIKO
He'll ask you again at dinner.

SASAMI
I know.  What will you do when we leave?

KAZUHIKO
Take care of the house while you're gone.  Then when you return it will
be ready for you.

SASAMI
We may never return.

KAZUHIKO
Never say never.  As Empress of the Universe I think you can have
a summer palace anywhere you want.

Sasami gives a forced laugh.

SASAMI
Earth is still a protectorate.  As Empress I can't come here whenever
I feel like it.  Plus I owe a duty to my people.

Kazuhiko shakes his head.

KAZUHIKO
Who will stop you, the police?  Mihoshi and me are the police.  Don't
make up excuses Sasami.

Sasami glances over at Kazuhiko.

SASAMI
Don't you think I'm too young for marriage?

Kazuhiko thinks about that for a moment.

KAZUHIKO
You do look young on the outside, but on the inside you're trying to
find your youth.  If I were thinking of marring you I'd say you look
too young.  Tenchi is the one who wants to marry you, and he wants to
give you back your youth.  What scares you more Sasami, being thought
of as young, or finding out you're really old on the inside.

Sasami pulls the car off the road and parks.

SASAMI
Thank you for letting me drive.  You can drive while we're in the town.

KAZUHIKO
I'm sorry Sasami.  I can tell you love Tenchi, and that Tenchi loves you.
Now if you both will just let that be enough.

Sasami looks over at Kazuhiko.

SASAMI
Empress of the universe, and memories of the ages.  Would you want that
in a wife?

Kazuhiko blushes.

KAZUHIKO
I don't have to worry about that.  To Tenchi it is part of you that
makes up the whole that he loves.  

Both sit quietly for a moment.

KAZUHIKO
Keep driving Sasami.  You need to practice in traffic too.

Sasami puts the car in gear and resumes driving.

SASAMI
Thank you Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
I'd like to think of you as my friend also.  A friend lets their friends
know what they think and why.

SASAMI
Is that so.  Well then when are you going to tell Mihoshi that you love
her?

Kazuhiko looks down at his lap.

KAZUHIKO
I don't know Sasami, I just don't know.

EXT. Car – DAY

The car moves on until hidden by traffic.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

EXT. Steps leading to the temple – DAY

Tenchi is walking up the steps in his work clothes.

He is carrying his bokken.

WASHU (O.C.)
Hello Tenchi.

EXT. Steps leading to the temple – DAY

Tenchi stands on the steps with his bokken.

Washu sits on a boulder just off the path behind some bushes.

Three floating cameras hover around her.

Tenchi turns to face Washu.

TENCHI
Hello Little Washu.

WASHU
I thought you were going to walk past me.

TENCHI
I have a lot on my mind.  I didn't think you were going to make it to my
practice today.

Washu's cameras move out to take up spots around Tenchi.

WASHU
I wouldn't let anything minor like an explosion stop me from watching
this practice.

TENCHI
Why is this...

The Light Hawk shield appears covering Tenchi's upper body.

His bokken dissolves into the Light Hawk Wing sword.

Another bokken stops a fraction of an inch from Tenchi's head by the
shield.

Tenchi spins swinging his Light Hawk sword.

EXT. Steps leading to the temple – DAY

Washu still sits on the boulder.

Tenchi has his Light Hawk Wing sword and shield.

Yoshou has his bokken held out near Tenchi's head.

Tenchi finishes his swing severing Yoshou's bokken and slicing across
his chest.

Blood wells up on Yoshou's chest.

Tenchi's Light Hawk Wing sword and shield disappear.

Yoshou reaches out and lightly taps Tenchi on the head with his bokken
stump.

YOSHOU
You lose.  You must follow though in your attack.

TENCHI
Grandfather...

YOSHOU
Did you get what you wanted Washu?

WASHU
Yes, I did Yoshou, thank you.

TENCHI
Grandfather, I...  I'm sorry.

YOSHOU
For not remembering your training?

TENCHI
For cutting you.

YOSHOU
You have improved a great deal.  I didn't think you would reach me with
your sword.

TENCHI
I didn't call for it.

YOSHOU
It's a part of you now.  It will appear with out you having to call for
it.  Now instead of summoning it you'll have to concentrate on keeping
it away.

Washu walks up and takes Yoshou's arm.

WASHU
Let Nurse Washu take care of that nasty cut for you.  Then I can finish
my exam.

Yoshou smiles at Washu.

TENCHI
But Grandfather what do I do now?

YOSHOU
Practice Tenchi, practice.

Yoshou and Washu leave moving up the steps toward the temple.

Tenchi remains standing there looking at his hands.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

Yoshou sits at the end nearest the kitchen, and Kazuhiko sits at the
opposite end.

To Yoshou's left sit Tsunami, Ryo-Ohki, Sasami, Kiyone, and Mihoshi.

To his right sit Washu, Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko.

Everyone begins eating.

TENCHI
Kazuhiko this meal is as good as...  Well, ah...

SASAMI
I think he's trying to say that it's better than my cooking.

TENCHI
No I wasn't!

Tenchi sees that Sasami is laughing.

TENCHI
I was going to say it's good as your cooking.

SASAMI
That's true Kazuhiko.  You've out done yourself with this meal.

KAZUHIKO
Thank you, I thought it would be appropriate for the occasion.

Tenchi nods to Kazuhiko.

He then looks over to Ryoko.

TENCHI
Ryoko may I have your permission to ask Sasami to be my third wife?

RYOKO
You have my permission Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles at Ryoko.

Tenchi looks over to Ayeka.

TENCHI
Ayeka may I have your permission to ask Sasami to be my third wife?

AYEKA
You have my permission Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles at Ayeka.

Tenchi stands and moves around the table.

He knells before Sasami and opens a small box with a diamond ring.

TENCHI
Will you marry me and take the position of my third wife?

SASAMI
What will you do when I become Empress of Jurai?

TENCHI
I am your most loyal subject your majesty.  Command me.

SASAMI
And what of the essence of Tsunami within me?

TENCHI
I shall keep no secrets from you, Sasami, and I shall not ask for any
of yours.  I understand the responsibility that you carry and I wouldn't
have you break faith with your people.

SASAMI
If I should choose to never return to Earth what would you do?

TENCHI
I shall stand by your side to the end of time Sasami.

SASAMI
Ryoko?

RYOKO
We shall stand with you Sasami.

SASAMI
Ayeka?

AYEKA
We shall stand with you Sasami.

Sasami holds out her hand.

SASAMI
I accept the position of third wife.

Tenchi places the ring on her finger and kisses her.

TENCHI
I love you Sasami.  Where do you wish to be married?

SASAMI
Little Washu, how soon could the Emperor and his wives make it here
to Earth?

Washu summons her laptop.

WASHU
They could get here by the 10th of September if they didn't waste any
time.

SASAMI
Good.  Then I'd like to be married here at the temple on the 23rd of
September during shuubun no hi.

AYEKA
Sasami that's...

SASAMI
I know Ayeka; it's right after your birthday.  It's also the fall
equinox festival.  At least our parents will be here for your birthday
this year.

AYEKA
Thank you Sasami.

TENCHI
The festival will be a wonderful time for a wedding, Sasami.  We can
start celebrating with Ayeka's birthday and end it with our wedding.

AYEKA
I don't want to take away from your wedding day.

SASAMI
Really sister you can be as silly as Tenchi.  Your birthday is important
to me.  This year's festival will be the best ever.

Sasami hands a piece of paper to Washu.

SASAMI
Could you please send this guest list to Jurai?

Washu looks over the list.

WASHU
Oh my, this is quite the who's who list.  You'll be happy to know your
grandfather is on here Mihoshi.

Mihoshi giggles.

MIHOSHI
That's so sweet of you Sasami.  I haven't seen grandfather in a long
time.

WASHU
I see you included Kiyone on the list.

SASAMI
I'll not let the Galaxy Police call her away like they did for Ayeka's
wedding.

KIYONE
Thank you Sasami.

WASHU
With my reputation I doubt that Professor Aramanokita will be happy
to see me.

SASAMI
I'm the Crown Princess and I'll meet my obligations.  If the guests are
uncomfortable they can always decline or leave.  I'll not allow any of
you to be insulted.

A small hole opens up near Washu.

She tosses the paper in the hole.

WASHU
Well that's taken care of.  Do you need anything else Sasami?

Sasami shakes her head.

SASAMI
No, all that's left is for me to plan the wedding with my sisters.

AYEKA
We can start planning tomorrow.  I have had enough for tonight.  Let's
see, I believe that it's Monday, correct?

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
Yes today is Monday.

AYEKA
Well then it's Sasami's night.  Ah, Ryoko would you mind staying with
me tonight; I don't feel like being alone.

RYOKO
Of course I'll stay with you tonight.

SASAMI
Ayeka, are you sure?  You still have half the month left.

AYEKA
I wish to thank you both for that, but yes, Sasami, I'm sure.  A great
weight has been lifted off of me.  Tsunami, I'm sorry for my behavior
earlier.

TSUNAMI
Ayeka, you had just cause to be upset with me.

Ayeka stands and walks around to Tsunami

She kneels before Tsunami and hugs her.

AYEKA
Please Tsunami; I need you to forgive me.

TSUNAMI
I forgive you Ayeka.

AYEKA
Thank you.  I love you Tsunami.  I love everyone here.  Thank you for
loving me when I least deserved it.  I think I'll go to bed now.

Ayeka stands and moves toward the family room.

Ryoko quickly stands and exits with her.

Tenchi looks at Sasami

TENCHI
That was very sudden.  Well Sasami I'm yours for the night if you
want me.

SASAMI
You're still as silly as ever Tenchi.  Let's go to bed.  You can read
me another story.

Tenchi smiles.

Both Tenchi and Sasami stand and leave the room.

Yoshou looks to Washu and Tsunami.

All three stand.

A portal opens up and the three step through.

The portal closes.

Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Ryo-Ohki start clearing the table.

INT. Dining room – Day (Tuesday, 23 June 1998; 22nd Day, 4th Month)

Lunch is laid out on the table.

Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko sit on one side of the table.

Ryo-Ohki, Sasami, Kiyone, and Mihoshi sit on the opposite side.

Kazuhiko sits at the end furthest from the kitchen.

The phone rings.

Tenchi starts to stand.

RYOKO
I got it.

Ryoko disappears.

RYOKO (O.C.)
Hello?

A pause.

RYOKO (O.C.)
That's wonderful; see you in the morning Father.

Ryoko reappears at her place at the table.

RYOKO
Father is flying back from the States tonight and will be here in the
morning.

Ayeka takes in a sudden breath.

AYEKA
He doesn't know about the attack...

She runs her hand down her stomach.

AYEKA
...or about me.

Tenchi takes Ayeka's hand.

TENCHI
I forgot to tell anyone.  We haven't told your father or mother yet 
either.

AYEKA
We can tell Father when he gets here.  I'll ask Washu to send a message
to the Emperor.

The phone rings again.

RYOKO
Well at least it's helping me to slow down when I eat.

Ryoko disappears again.

RYOKO (O.C.)
Hello?

A pause.

RYOKO (O.C)
Hold on.  Hey everybody it's Daijiro and Ryoe!

A pause.

RYOKO (O.C.)
Wow!  I haven't heard from you guys in a while.  

A pause.

RYOKO (O.C.)
Sure you can stop in tomorrow.  Yeah, no problem.  

A pause.

RYOKO (O.C.)
Okay it's a date, see you both tomorrow afternoon.

Ryoko reappears at her place at the table.

RYOKO
Both of them will be here for dinner tomorrow.

Sasami claps her hands.

SASAMI
It's been months since they were last here.

AYEKA
We'll have to tell them what happened also.

Tenchi hugs Ayeka.

AYEKA
I'm okay Tenchi just a little sad because so many others were counting
on our child.

Tenchi gives Ayeka a kiss.

AYEKA
I need to go into town tomorrow to pick up some personnel things.

KAZUHIKO
Sasami and me were going food shopping tomorrow.  We're leaving early,
around six.

AYEKA
Excellent I'll see you then.

INT. Kitchen – DAY (Wednesday, 24 June 1998; 23rd Day, 4th Month)

Sasami sits at the counter drinking a cup of tea.

Kazuhiko is moving from cabinet to cabinet.

After he looks in each cabinet he adds to his shopping list.

Ayeka enters the Kitchen.

AYEKA
Good morning Kazuhiko, Sasami.

Kazuhiko looks up from his list.

KAZUHIKO
Good morning Ayeka.  I'm almost finished with the shopping list.

SASAMI
Good morning sister, would you like some tea?

AYEKA
Yes please.  Do we have time for breakfast?

SASAMI
No, not really.  Kazuhiko said he would take us out to eat.

KAZUHIKO
That's right.  I planned on getting something to eat on the way into
town.  Let me double check the freezer and we can go.

Kazuhiko looks in the freezer.

Ayeka quickly drinks the cup of tea Sasami poured.

He writes a couple things on the list.

KAZUHIKO
I'm finished.

Kazuhiko, Sasami, and Ayeka exit the house through the kitchen door.

INT. Family room, Father's house – DAY

The room is festively decorated.

Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Washu,
and Tsunami all lounge around the room.

A large cake with "Welcome Home Father" sits on the table.

EXT. Front porch, Father's house – DAY

Yoshou and Tenchi stand on the front porch.

Father's van pulls up to the house.

Father gets out of the van.

Tenchi moves off the porch and gives his father a hug.

FATHER
It's good to see you Tenchi.  How have you been?

TENCHI
I've been well Father.  A lot has happened while you were gone.

FATHER
We can talk inside.  Who's your new friend?

YOSHOU
I'll give you one guess Nobuyuki.

FATHER
Dad, is that you?

Yoshou hugs Father.

GRANDFATHER
Yes son it is I.

FATHER
I don't understand.

TENCHI
Let's go inside dad.  I mean a lot has happened while you were gone.

The three walk into the house.

INT. Family room, Father's house – DAY

Father, Yoshou, and Tenchi enter the room.

All the girls shout "Welcome home Father."

They throw party streamers.

FATHER
Thank you everybody.  It's good to be back home.

Father holds his arms open and walks over to hug the girls.

He starts with Ayeka.

FATHER
How is the mother of my grandchild doing today?

AYEKA
I'm well Father, but the same can't be said of your Grandson.

Ayeka moves Father over to the couch and sets him down.

She sits next to him and holds his hand.

AYEKA
I lost the baby Father.

Tears form in Father's eyes.

He hugs Ayeka close.

FATHER
Sometimes life isn't fair.  There'll be more opportunities in the future.

AYEKA
Thank you Father.  I'll get you your grandchild yet.

FATHER
Forgive me Ayeka.  I don't mean to push anyone into having children.
Don't do it for me but do it for you and Tenchi.

Father releases his hug and looks in Ayeka's eyes.

He gives Ayeka a light kiss.

FATHER
I love you my daughter.

Ayeka smiles.

Father looks at the others.

FATHER
And how is my other daughter doing?

RYOKO
I'm happy Father.  It will be awhile before you get a grandchild from
me though.

Father laughs.

He stands and gives Ryoko a hug.

FATHER
That's okay Ryoko.  Like I said I can wait.  It's good to see you again
Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
Thank you Father.

Father walks over to Mihoshi and Kiyone.

He holds a hand from each of them.

FATHER
Mihoshi and Kiyone together again.  It has been awhile Kiyone.

KIYONE
My duties have kept me away.  Mihoshi decided to come and drag me here.

MIHOSHI
Kiyone!

Kiyone starts laughing.

She hugs Mihoshi.

KIYONE
I should say she saved my life again.  I'm very happy to be here Father.
I'm happy to be alive.

Father hugs them both.

FATHER
Hi Sasami.  My but you have grown into a fine woman while I was gone.
Ah...  Are you by chance cooking tonight?

SASAMI
Yes I am father.  We went shopping earlier today just for you.

Father moves next to Sasami and hugs her.

FATHER
I thank you from the bottom of my stomach.  That American food is so
heavy.

Sasami smiles and waves her hand to show it's no big deal.

Father looks at Yoshou.

He sees that a new girl and adult Washu are each hanging off Yoshou's
arms.

FATHER
So dad, can you tell me what's going on in your life?

YOSHOU
You know that I'm the son of Azusa?

Father nods his head.

YOSHOU
Well I've disguised my appearance all this time.  This is my true
appearance.

FATHER
I see.  Washu you are looking very good and, I'm sorry, I didn't get
your name young lady.

TSUNAMI
It's Tsunami, Father.

FATHER
Oh, I see.  I don't understand, but I see.

YOSHOU
Life moves on Nobuyuki.

FATHER
Maybe we can talk a little later dad.  Anyway let's enjoy this party.
I'm truly happy to be home with my family again.

Sasami hands Father a knife to cut the cake.

INT. Family room, Tenchi's house – DAY

Tsunami, Washu, Ryo-Ohki, Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Kiyone sit on the
couches.

They are enjoying tea and cakes.

Yoshou, Father, and Tenchi sit at a card table with the Mah Jongg tiles.

Sasami and Kazuhiko enter from the kitchen.

Kazuhiko joins the men at the table.

Sasami joins the women on the couch.

SASAMI
All the preliminary stuff is done for dinner.

KAZUHIKO
It'll only take about twenty minutes to finish dinner up.

Kazuhiko begins shuffling the tiles.

KAZUHIKO
Want to start a game while we wait for Daijiro and Ryoe?

FATHER
Yes, it'll let us warm up.

The men begin playing Mah Jongg.

The doorbell rings.

Tenchi gets up and leaves the room.

TENCHI (O.C.)
Welcome to my house.  Please come in.

Yoshou gathers the Mah Jongg tiles to start a new game.

Tenchi, Daijiro, and Ryoe enter the room.

Everyone stands to greet them.

TENCHI
Let me bring you up to date.

DAIJIRO
I have some news that I would like to announce first.

Ryoe has a beaming grin on her face.

DAIJIRO
Ryoe is two months pregnant!

AYEKA
Congratulations Ryoe!

RYOE
Thank you Ayeka.  Now your child can have a little playmate.

Ayeka takes Ryoe's hand.

AYEKA
Yes, but yours will have to wait a bit.

Ryoe's face loses her grin.

Tenchi steps up next to Ayeka and takes her other hand.

RYOE
What do you mean?

AYEKA
I lost the child.

Ryoe hugs Ayeka.

RYOE
Oh Ayeka!  I'm so sorry.  I didn't want to bring you bad news.

AYEKA
Your being pregnant is joyous news Ryoe.  I'm very happy for you.

DAIJIRO
What happened?

TENCHI
It's a long story that had best wait for dinner.  Right now I believe
that ladies are going to the bath while we gentlemen sit down for some
serious Mah Jongg.

RYOE
I've been looking forward to the bath from the time we left to come here.

RYOKO
Let's go then.

The women file out of the room.

The men take seats around the table.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

Yoshou sits at the end nearest the kitchen with Nobuyuki on his left.

To his right sit Washu, Ayeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, and Kiyone.

To his left sit Tsunami, Ryo-Ohki, Sasami, Daijiro, and Ryoe.

Kazuhiko with Mihoshi on his left sit at the opposite end.

DAIJIRO
Wow!  All that happened and you didn't call us?

TENCHI
At the time we were really busy, and afterwards we were just trying
to recover.

RYOE
We didn't see anything on the news.

TENCHI
Well it helps to be out here in the middle of nowhere and…

Tenchi looks over at Washu.

WASHU
I have a few devices scattered around to keep the press away.

DAIJIRO
I thought none of your stuff was working.

Washu chuckles.

WASHU
Anything that was powered from subspace quit working.  I do have some
more mundane devices here and there.

DAIJIRO
There was another reason for our visit.

Daijiro looks down at his hands.

TENCHI
Go ahead and tell us.
 
RYOE
We'd like to go back to Jurai.

SASAMI
You want to leave Earth?

AYEKA
Are you sure about this?

Daijiro looks back up.

DAIJIRO
Ryoe and I have talked this over.  Even with everything that happened
we truly enjoyed ourselves.

WASHU
What of your parents, Daijiro?

RYOE
My husband has drifted away from his family.  It's hard to remain silent.

TENCHI
Why do you want this Daijiro?

DAIJIRO
There's so much to see and do in the universe and we want to be a part
of it.  I've been hiding the truth from my parents.  Now I just want
to go back out there and live.

RYOKO
What about you Ryoe?

RYOE
I too want to return to space.  Daijiro would do well representing
Earth before Jurai.  One day this planet will join the galactic
community.

DAIJIRO
I'd like to help that day come sooner.

TENCHI
What do you think Sasami?

SASAMI
I believe that Daijiro and Ryoe would well represent Earth.  I'll ask
father when he arrives.  I'm sure he'll take you both back to Jurai
with him.

RYOE
Thank you Sasami.

DAIJIRO
Yes, thank you, and we'll definitely be here for your wedding.

TENCHI
Well, now that's settled.  Both of you will spend the night of course?

DAIJIRO
Yes I'll gladly accept your offer.

SASAMI
Okay, we've left the spare room just the way you left it.

INT. Cemetery – DAY (Thursday, 25 June 1998; 24th Day, 4th Month)

The sun rises on the small cemetery.

Tenchi kneels before his son's stone.

Yoshou enters the scene and walks up behind Tenchi.

He lays a hand on Tenchi's shoulder.

Tenchi turns to face his grandfather.

YOSHOU
What brings you out so early in the morning?

TENCHI
What we talked about at dinner last night.  It has stirred memories
in my mind that I couldn't sleep.  Why are we here Grandfather?

Yoshou kneels beside Tenchi.

YOSHOU
What do you mean Tenchi?

TENCHI
You've been on Earth for seven hundred years.  What did you do during
that time?

YOSHOU
I did many things Tenchi.  Some of them good and some not so good.
That's all in the past now.  Does it really mean so much to you?

TENCHI
Grandfather...

Both look each other in the eye.

TENCHI
How many uncles and aunts do I have, and how many cousins?  

YOSHOU
I'll take it you mean on your mother's side.  Achika was my only child
in all those years.

TENCHI
I'm not as naïve as I once was.  Are you trying to tell me then that
you went all that time with out a woman?

Yoshou leans against Itsuki's stone.

YOSHOU
Itsuki was my seventh wife.

TENCHI
Seven!  And Achika was your only child?

YOSHOU
Itsuki was the first women I brought to Funaho.  Our blood is not as
close to Earth blood as you may think.  For some reason Funaho changed
Itsuki so she could bear my child.

TENCHI
Your Life Tree did that?  I didn't know that could happen.

YOSHOU
Neither did I Tenchi.  I miss Itsuki more than any of the others.  She
gave her life to Achika.

TENCHI
My mother gave her life for me, and Ayeka nearly gave her life for our
son.  I'm trying to understand my past so that I can better understand
myself.

YOSHOU
Why don't we go inside then?  I'll tell you the story of my life on
Earth.

Both men stand.

TENCHI
What about your life that brought you to Earth?

YOSHOU
Some things in the past are best left buried.

Tenchi nods his head.

Both men move off the hill toward the temple.

INT. Tenchi's Kitchen – DAY

Ayeka is preparing breakfast.

Ryoko enters the room.

RYOKO
Good morning Princess.

AYEKA
What drags you out of bed so early?

RYOKO
Tenchi woke up early and went to the temple.  So do you mind if I help
with breakfast?

Ayeka looks at Ryoko.

AYEKA
No, not at all.  I don't think anyone has been poisoned this week.

RYOKO
Only because you haven't cooked this week!

AYEKA
Is that right!  Well demon woman lets see what you can do with this!

RYOKO
I'll show you what I can...

Ryoko breaks down laughing.

Ayeka joins her in laughter.

Mihoshi and Kiyone enter the kitchen.

MIHOSHI
See Kiyone, I told you they weren't fighting.

KIYONE
I guess you're right Mihoshi.

An explosion rocks the house.

Both Ayeka and Ryoko stop laughing.

AYEKA
What was that?

RYOKO
Washu.

On cue Washu enters the kitchen.

She is covered in soot and her clothing is torn.

WASHU
Good morning everyone.

Washu moves to the refrigerator and pours herself some juice.

She turns and starts back toward the family room.

On her way out she grabs some donuts.

RYOKO
You okay mom?

Washu turns and looks at Ryoko.

WASHU
Yes, I'm fine thank you.  A little problem with one of my experiments
is all.  Nothing to worry about.

Washu exits the kitchen.

MIHOSHI
I think that Ms. Washu is working to hard, and I'm worried for her.

AYEKA
Someday she's going to blow us all up.  Of course it'll be to late then
to worry about it.

RYOKO
That's my mother you're talking about.

Ayeka simply nods her head.

RYOKO
I'm afraid you may be right.

KIYONE 
What's she working on anyway?

RYOKO
I don't know.  She's been locked up in the lab ever since she watched
Tenchi's sword practice on Monday.

MIHOSHI
Do you think you can get her to stop Ryoko?

RYOKO
Why?

MIHOSHI
I'm really worried about her.

RYOKO
Oh, well I don't think I can anyway.  Once she grabs a hold of something,
she doesn't let go.

INT. Temple office – DAY

Tenchi sets out the teacups

Yoshou prepares the tea.

When he is finished he moves over to the table.

Tenchi takes the tea and pours.

YOSHOU
Where do I begin?

TENCHI
I think at the beginning would be best.

YOSHOU
By the western calendar it was the year 1388 when I arrived.  Ryoko's
and my ship crashed and formed the lake outside your house.  I fought
with Ryoko, but she proved to be no match for my skill.

TENCHI
How did you beat her Grandfather?

YOSHOU
I think she was still weak from her attack on Jurai.  After I had taken
away her gems I locked her into a dimensional prison within Funaho.
I placed the Key in the shrine to seal her in.  I then left this area
to wander Japan.

TENCHI
What kept anyone from releasing her?

Yoshou holds out his cup for more tea.

Tenchi refills both cups.

YOSHOU
The prison was not in this dimension.  There was no way to get to it
from the cave entrance. A short way beyond the gate was a blank wall.

TENCHI
How did I get there then?

YOSHOU
I had Funaho open a path before you came.

TENCHI
Ryoko told me that you planned on me releasing her when I returned.

Yoshou nods his head.

YOSHOU
After I left I saw much suffering across the land.  I could understand
why my mother was so happy to leave this place.  After two years
I decided to do something about it.  I wanted to bring honor to the land.
I started a Kendo School.

TENCHI
Wait a second.  I studied the history of Kendo in class.  The first
Kendo school was in 1390.  Damn, I never put two and two together.
You are a part of my history Grandfather.

YOSHOU
I was able to change my appearance.  After forty years with the school
I faked my death.  I took up the life of a wondering hermit.  My school
didn't bring nobility to the land like I wanted, but instead it brought
warlords.

TENCHI
That was a pretty bloody period of our history.  One shogun was always
fighting another to claim territory.

YOSHOU
Yes and I would wander from province to province lending aid to what
ever shogun was doing the most to help the people.

TENCHI
Were you able to help anyone?

YOSHOU
Very few.  Then one day a young nobleman road past me.  His horse
stumbled into a hole and threw the boy.  He was dead of a broken neck
before I could help him.  His name was Obe Nobunaga.

TENCHI
Wait, I know that name.  He was the one that almost unified Japan.
Before he could finish he was assassinated.

YOSHOU
I took his identity.  I thought I'd be able to bring peace to the land
if I unified it under one leader.

TENCHI
And the assassination?

YOSHOU
I had grown quite adept at faking my death.  One more was not
a challenge.

Yoshou stands up.

Tenchi stands up with him.

YOSHOU
We'll continue this after some practice.  May as well use our time
wisely.

TENCHI
Are you trying to avoid the next years in your life?

YOSHOU
Far from it.  I'm going to relive them during your practice.  You had
better be at your best or I'll hurt you.

Tenchi nods his head and smiles.

TENCHI
Fine, I'd like to work out some frustration anyway.

Yoshou picks up three bokkens and tosses one to Tenchi.

TENCHI
When did you start using two swords?

YOSHOU
This is the style my father taught me.  I taught you one sword so that
you could better use the Light Hawk Wing.  Let's go and see how much
you've learned.

The two men leave the temple.

INT. Dining room – Day

Ayeka, Ryoko, Daijiro, and Ryoe sit on one side.  Washu, Sasami,
Ryo-Ouki, Kiyone, and Mihoshi sit on the other side.  Kazuhiko sits
at the end farthest from the kitchen.

AYEKA
Tenchi has not come back for breakfast.

WASHU
I think that he and Yoshou are doing some more sword practice this
morning.

RYOKO
Then we should take him breakfast.

Both Ayeka and Sasami nod their head.

The three stand and move out to the kitchen.

MIHOSHI
Aren't you going to go with them Ms. Washu?

Washu shakes her head.

WASHU
No, I still have a lot of work to do in the lab.

Washu stands and starts to leave the room.

KIYONE
What are you working on now?

She answers over her shoulder.

WASHU
Nothing much, just doing some research.

Washu leaves the room.

MIHOSHI
I'm really worried about her Kiyone.

KIYONE
You keep saying that Mihoshi.  What do you mean?

MIHOSHI
I'm afraid that she's going to get hurt.

KAZUHIKO
She's pretty tough.  Washu hasn't been hurt by any of her experiments
yet.

MIHOSHI
That's not the hurt I'm talking about.

KIYONE
Then what are you talking about?

MIHOSHI
I better get laundry started.

Mihoshi leaves the room in a hurry.

KAZUHIKO
When Mihoshi worries, I worry.

KIYONE
I must agree with you on that.

EXT. Path to the temple – DAY

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami walk along the path.

Ayeka and Ryoko carry two bento boxes each while Sasami carries one.

RYOKO
I think I hear them up ahead.  Let's watch from the bushes.

The other two nod.

All three move into the bushes.

EXT. Practice area – DAY

Tenchi stands in the practice area with one bokken.

Yoshou faces him with two bokkens.

YOSHOU
Just watch me while I go through my forms.

Yoshou starts going through several different forms using both bokkens.

EXT. Bushes by the practice area – DAY

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami are hiding behind some bushes.

AYEKA
I recognize that style.  That's father's style.  I remember him teaching
Yoshou how to fight with two swords.

RYOKO
Why did he teach Tenchi just one sword.  He only used one sword when
he fought me.

Ayeka shrugs her shoulders.

AYEKA
I don't know.  If I had seen him fight like this when I first got here
I would have recognized him right away.

EXT. Practice area – DAY

Yoshou goes through his forms using two bokkens.

Tenchi watches his grandfather.

Tenchi's eyes go wider as Yoshou goes through his exercise.

TENCHI
Grandfather!  I recognize that style.  That is the style used by
Miyamoto Musashi.

YOSHOU
Yes that's correct Tenchi.

TENCHI
Wait, that means you were...  Are Miyamoto Musashi.

YOSHOU
Yes, that is one of the many names I have had over the last 700 years.

Yoshou looks over at the bushes.

YOSHOU
I think our breakfast is here.  We'll continue the practice after we eat.

Tenchi looks in the same direction as Yoshou.

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Sasami step out from the bushes.

Ayeka and Ryoko carry two bento boxes each while Sasami carries one.

AYEKA
Lord Tenchi, Brother.

RYOKO
Hi guys.

TENCHI
Thank you for bringing breakfast.

Ryoko hands a box to Tenchi.

RYOKO
Did you find what you were looking for this morning?

Tenchi takes the box and smiles.

TENCHI
Not yet Ryoko, but I think my search is coming to an end.

Ayeka hands a box to Yoshou.

AYEKA
Hello brother.  I see that father's training is still with you.

YOSHOU
Thank you sister.  Father's training has always been with me.  I'm sorry
for deceiving you.

Ayeka smiles and gives Yoshou a kiss on the cheek.

AYEKA
I've forgiven you brother.  Thanks to your deception I've found the true
wonder of life.

Sasami moves to a clearing near the practice area.

SASAMI
We can sit here and have a picnic.

The other four join Sasami and sit on the ground.

SASAMI
How are you Tenchi?

TENCHI
I'm fine Sasami.  Last night made me think of how precious all of you
are to me.  I don't want to miss out because of something I don't
understand.

SASAMI
How important is your past to you?

TENCHI
It's what I am.

RYOKO
You're what you are.  Nothing will change that.

AYEKA
Yes Lord Tenchi.  You already have within you all that is important.

Tenchi looks at his two wives in turn, Ryoko and Ayeka, and then Sasami.

All three smile back at him.

Tenchi smiles broadly.

TENCHI
I love you three completely.  Nothing will change that.  Nothing.  Not
my past, nor my future.  Yet there is something out there that draws me.
I have to find it.   I hope you can understand.

AYEKA
I understand too well Tenchi.  Don't let what you find consume you.
That's all the advice I can give.

RYOKO
Yes Tenchi.  My past has strengthened me.  I've accepted it completely.

TENCHI
I don't have that much of a past.

Sasami looks away into the woods.

SASAMI
Our past is made of the sum of our parts.

YOSHOU
This is a wonderful breakfast girls.

Everyone blinks and then starts eating.

INT. Living Room – DAY

Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Kazuhiko sit on the couch watching a cartoon show.

All three are laughing.

KIYONE
Why did I never appreciate these shows in the past?

KAZUHIKO
Did you ever take time out to watch them?

MIHOSHI
Kazuhiko!  

KAZUHIKO
What?

KIYONE
That's okay Mihoshi.

Mihoshi shakes her head.

MIHOSHI
It's not okay.  Do you really want an answer Kiyone?

KIYONE
No, not really.  I know the answer.  Why do you stay with me Mihoshi?
That is a question that I do want answered.

MIHOSHI
Do you remember when I walked into your dorm room?

Kiyone's face brightens with a smile as recall that day.

KIYONE
You walked in and found me sitting in my chair studying a technical
manual.

MIHOSHI
I found you sober in your room studying a technical manual.

KIYONE
I always was a loner.

Mihoshi smiles and takes Kiyone's hand.

MIHOSHI
That's why I walked into your life.  I saw something in you that you
failed to see in yourself.

Tears form in Kiyone's eyes.

KIYONE
You've manipulated my career from the day you walked into my room.
I used to hate you for that.  Now...  Now I don't know what to think.

MIHOSHI
I love you Kiyone.  I love you like the sister I'll never have.

KIYONE
I know Mihoshi.  I just wish I could do something to be worthy of your
love.  I'm sorry I've disappointed you.

Mihoshi wraps Kiyone in a hug.

MIHOSHI
What do you want from your career Kiyone?

Kiyone returns the hug.

KIYONE
I thought I knew the answer to that.  Now all I want is to find some
happiness.  I think I've found that here in this house with people that
love me as I am.		

KAZUHIKO
It's funny that we have to travel so far to find the happiness that was
always with us.

Mihoshi and Kiyone separate.

MIHOSHI
I can now see the person I saw when I walked into your room.

KIYONE
Am I, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi nods her head and smiles.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

EXT. Practice area – DAY

Tenchi, Yoshou, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami sit on the ground around the
remains of a picnic.

YOSHOU
You, young ladies provided an excellent breakfast.

TENCHI
Thank you.  I'll bet each of you had a hand in making the meal.

RYOKO
Okay then, who made what?

Tenchi's face grows serious and he rubs his chin.

TENCHI
You made the rice balls Ryoko.  Ayeka made the fish, and Sasami made
the rest.

Sasami claps her hands.

SASAMI
You're correct Tenchi!

Everyone is smiling.

Yoshou stands up.

YOSHOU
Time to get back to practice.

TENCHI
Okay Grandfather.

Tenchi stands up.

The three girls start putting away the boxes.

YOSHOU
You need to use all of your skill Tenchi.  I'm going to try and hurt you.
We'll fight until one is 'dead'.

TENCHI
I understand Grandfather.

Tenchi and Yoshou move ten paces apart.

Yoshou places his swords at his side.

His right hand on the long sword and his left on the short sword.

Tenchi places his sword at his side holding it with the right hand.

YOSHOU
Ready?

Tenchi nods.

Yoshou slow draws his long sword.

Tenchi quick draws his sword and charges.

Yoshou quick draws and throws his short sword.

Tenchi knocks the flying blade away from his throat.

He stops as he feels Yoshou's long blade against his throat.

TENCHI
You threw away your weapon.

Yoshou nods.

YOSHOU
You're the second person to block that attack.  The first died the same
way you died.  Now tell me what you did wrong?

Tenchi shrugs his shoulders.

TENCHI
I'm not sure.

YOSHOU
Ayeka, Ryoko?

RYOKO
He put himself out of position to stop the thrown blade.

YOSHOU
Why?

AYEKA
I think I understand this lesson.

TENCHI
Tell me.

AYEKA
You didn't have to stop the attack.  You could have moved or defected
the blade just enough to keep it from killing you.

Ayeka turns toward Yoshou.

AYEKA
Tenchi would have been able to counter your attack and most likely
follow through with his own attack.

Yoshou nods.

YOSHOU
There will come a time when you must decide what is more important.
Defeating your enemy or saving yourself.

TENCHI
That blow would've killed me if I hadn't stopped it.

YOSHOU
It would've crushed your larynx, but nothing beyond Sasami's powers to
heal.

TENCHI
I forgot about Sasami being here.

RYOKO
I can understand that Tenchi.  I've operated alone for so long I never 
take into account others around me.

SASAMI
I think you're playing a very dangerous game.

Ayeka lays her hand on Sasami's shoulder.

AYEKA
Life is a dangerous game Sasami.  To win you have to take everything
into account.  

SASAMI
What if the blow did kill him!  I may be able to heal but I can't raise
the dead!

Ayeka draws Sasami into a hug.

AYEKA
It's all right little one.  Sometimes to truly learn we must make
sacrifices.  Our brother was willing to sacrifice Tenchi's life now
so that he will be able to live in the future.

Ryoko gathers Sasami and Ayeka into a hug.

RYOKO
Draw upon your memories Sasami.  You'll see that Ayeka speaks the truth.

Tenchi looks over at the girls and then at his Grandfather.

TENCHI
I understand Grandfather.  I must be willing to look at the whole
picture, and not focus on just my part.

Yoshou nods and lays a hand on Tenchi's shoulder.

YOSHOU
That is the essence of victory.

TENCHI
Shall we continue with practice?

YOSHOU
No, we've done enough for today.  You should spend some time with your
wives.

Tenchi smiles.

TENCHI
That sounds like the best advice I've had today.

Tenchi hands his bokken to Yoshou.

He turns and wraps his wives and Sasami in a hug.

TENCHI
I think a relaxing bath would be great right now.

SASAMI
I think that's a wonderful idea.

Both Ryoko and Ayeka nod.

Ayeka, and Ryoko pick up the bento boxes.

The four depart the practice area leaving Yoshou alone.

TSUNAMI (O.C.)
You have done well Yoshou.

YOSHOU
Thank you.  I think there is some tea at the shrine.

EXT. Practice area – DAY

Yoshou stands holding three bokkens.

Tsunami stands on the edge of the clearing.

TSUNAMI
That sounds wonderful.

Yoshou smiles and moves over to Tsunami.

He holds the three bokkens in his left, and takes Tsunami's hand in
his right.

The two depart the area moving up hill.

INT. Living Room – DAY

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko sit on one couch.

Kiyone, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi sit on the other couch

Everyone is watching a news program.

A muffled explosion is heard.

The house shakes.

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko lean over the back of the couch to look down
the hall.

Kiyone, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi get off the couch to look down the hall.

INT. Wide Hallway – DAY

Looking down the hall at the stairs and Washu's lab door.

Sasami comes down the stairs.

The lab door open and Washu steps out.

Washu is covered in soot and her clothing torn.

SASAMI
Are you okay Ms. Washu?

WASHU
I'm fine, just fine.  I think I'll take a bath.

Washu turns to her left and moves down the narrow hallway.

Sasami move down the wide hall to the living room.

INT. Living Room – DAY

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko sit on one couch.

Kiyone, Mihoshi and Kazuhiko stand near the hall entrance.

Sasami walks down the hall and stops in front of Tenchi.

SASAMI
Well what are you waiting for Tenchi?

TENCHI
Pardon?

SASAMI
I said what are you waiting for.

TENCHI
I don't understand.

AYEKA
Aren't you going to check to see if Ms. Washu is okay?

Tenchi's eyes go wide in shock.

TENCHI
But...  She's taking a bath!

RYOKO
So?

TENCHI
I can't just walk in on her!

SASAMI
Why not?

TENCHI
Well she's...   I'm...  It's not proper.  I could call Grandfather!
I'm sure he could come down.

MIHOSHI
Tenchi, I'm very worried about Ms. Washu.

Tenchi looks at Mihoshi and then to the three girls.

TENCHI
What is it you want me to do about it?

SASAMI
Find out what's on her mind.  Something is going on.  That's twice
she's blown up her lab today.

Tenchi again looks at his wives and Sasami, and then at Mihoshi and
Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
Go for it, buddy!

Tenchi's shoulders slump.

TENCHI
Okay, I'll see what's going on.

Sasami lays a hand on Tenchi's arm.

SASAMI
I know you'll do the right thing.

AYEKA
Yes Lord Tenchi.  Please do what you can for her.

RYOKO
I love her Tenchi.

Tenchi smiles and nods to Ryoko.

TENCHI
I know you do Ryoko.  Okay, here I go.

Tenchi walks down the wide hall and turns right down the narrow one.

INT. Onsen – Day

Washu kneels at the water's edge naked.

Her face, hair and lower arms are covered in soot.

Places along her body have streaks of soot where the clothing was torn.

She fills her tub and bucket with water.

TENCHI (O.C.)
Little Washu?

Washu's eyes go wide and she looks over her shoulder.

WASHU
May I help you Tenchi?

INT. Changing room door – DAY

Tenchi stands in the doorway wearing a towel around his waist.

He holds a stool, tub, and a bucket will with bath stuff.

TENCHI
I was wondering if you would like someone to scrub your back?

WASHU (O.C.)
That would be very nice of you.

Tenchi walks out and drops off his stool next to Washu's.

He empties his bucket of soap, shampoo, and wash clothes.

Tenchi moves over to kneel down next to Washu.

Washu stands and moves out of the scene.

Tenchi fills his bucket and tub with water.

He stands and moves behind Washu.

Washu is sitting on her stool using her washcloth to mix soap in the tub.

Tenchi sits on his stool.

TENCHI
I'll start with your hair.

Washu nods her head.

Tenchi pours water from the bucket onto Washu's hair.

He adds shampoo and starts to work it in.

Washu uses her cloth to clean her face.

Washu dips a second cloth in the bucket to rinse her face.

WASHU
You have gentle hands Tenchi.

TENCHI
I get a lot of practice with my wives.

WASHU
Why are you here?

TENCHI
We're worried about you Little Washu.  That's the second lab explosion
today.

WASHU
I see.

Tenchi continues to work on Washu's hair whiles she washes the front
of her body.

TENCHI
Why is it when your lab blows up the whole house shakes?

WASHU
You know that the dimensional tunnel connects my lab to the house.

TENCHI
Yes.

WASHU
The kinetic energy of the explosion it transferred though the conduit
to apply force to the house.

TENCHI
I see.

WASHU
Maybe I should explain that another way.

TENCHI
No, I understand.  My house and your lab are connected by a flexible
pipe.  If you shake one end then the other end is going to shake too.

WASHU
That's right!

TENCHI
May I ask what you're working on?

Washu sighs and stops washing.

WASHU
Remember when Mihoshi blew up my physical exam robot?

Tenchi chuckles.

TENCHI
Yes.

WASHU
You told me I was looking at the problem from the wrong end.  The first
explosion was from a DNA sample of Mihoshi's mother.

TENCHI
Her mother?

WASHU
Yes.  The second explosion was from a DNA sample from her grandmother.

TENCHI
What about her father and grandfather?

WASHU
Both of those tested fine.

TENCHI
Time for the rinse.

Tenchi stands and moves over to the onsen.

He fills his bucket and moves back behind Washu

TENCHI
Ready?

Washu nods her head.

Tenchi slowly pours the water over Washu rinsing out the shampoo.

He ties Washu's hair up out of the way.

Tenchi mixes soap in the tub with his washcloth.

He starts scrubbing Washu's back.
 
Washu continues to wash her front.

TENCHI
Have you found a common thread in all this?

WASHU
I think so, but instead of getting answers I get more questions.

TENCHI
Hmm.

Tenchi finishes washing Washu's back.

He stands and moves over to the onsen.

Tenchi refills his bucket and moves back behind Washu.

Using his second cloth he rinses off Washu's back.

He sits down on his stool.

TENCHI
What conclusions have you come up with so far?

WASHU
Several, but they make no sense.

Washu spins on her stool to face Tenchi.

WASHU
My turn to wash your back.

TENCHI
That's okay, you don't have too.

WASHU
I insist.

Tenchi smiles and turns around.

WASHU
The towel?

Tenchi pulls the towel from his waist and sets it to the side.

Washu stands and moves over to the onsen.

She fills her bucket and returns to stand behind Tenchi.

Tenchi starts to wash his front.

Washu pours water over Tenchi's head and adds Shampoo to his hair.

She sits back down and starts to wash his hair.

TENCHI
So, what will you do next?

WASHU
The biggest problem I have so far is the lack of hard evidence.  I have
a lot of questions that I think only Mihoshi can answer.

TENCHI
Mihoshi is very worried about your research.  She thinks you're going
to be hurt by it.

WASHU
Tenchi, this research has consumed me.  I spend every waking moment
trying to make sense of the data.

TENCHI
Is this really so important to you Little Washu?

WASHU
Yes.

TENCHI
What will you do next?

WASHU
Rinse your hair.

Tenchi chuckles.

Washu returns to the onsen to refill the bucket.

She rinses the shampoo out of Tenchi's hair.

Washu sit behind Tenchi and starts to scrub his back.

WASHU
I need to confront Mihoshi with my findings.

TENCHI
She's not going to like that.

WASHU
I know.  That's why I'll need your help.

TENCHI
Will you hurt Mihoshi, Little Washu?

WASHU
I don't know.

TENCHI
I'll support you on this.  The biggest problem will be Kazuhiko.  He
has grown rather attached to Mihoshi.  I'll take care of him, but you'll
have to handle Mihoshi.

WASHU
That sounds fair enough.

Washu stands and moves over to the onsen.

She refills the bucket and moves back behind Tenchi.

TENCHI
Little Washu?

WASHU
Yes?

TENCHI
No matter what happens I'll still love you.

Washu pours the water over Tenchi's back to rinse off the soap.

WASHU
Thank you Tenchi.  That means a lot to me.

TENCHI
When will you ask?

WASHU
Tonight at supper.

Tenchi picks up his towel and wraps it around his waist.

He stands and faces Washu.

Washu looks up into his eyes.

TENCHI
I'll see you there.

Washu nods her head.

Tenchi picks up his stuff and leaves the onsen.

INT. Women's changing room – DAY

Washu stands wearing pale green tights and a pale pink long sleeved 
shirt.

She holds a pair of olive colored cargo shorts in her hand.

A light red vest lies on the bench next to her.

Sasami walks in the changing room.

WASHU
Hello Sasami.

Sasami stops in front of Washu.

SASAMI
Hello Ms. Washu.

WASHU
Why so formal?

SASAMI
Are you sure you want the answers Little Washu?

WASHU
Yes, I'm sure.  I need to figure out Mihoshi's past.

SASAMI
Is it her past you're looking into or is it your own?

WASHU
What do you mean?

Sasami smiles and reaches out to touch Washu's cheek.

SASAMI
I'm wondering what it is that motivates you?

WASHU
Knowledge motivates me.

Sasami nods her head.

WASHU
You have the answers I seek.  Why don't you tell them to me and save
Mihoshi from my questions?

SASAMI
I know the answers, but I can't answer your questions.

WASHU
Why?  What holds your tongue?

SASAMI
I've made a promise to Tsunami.  I won't break that promise.

WASHU
You've said that before.  What force in the universe could hold Tsunami
to such a promise?  What is there that...

Washu's eyes go wide.

SASAMI
Now you begin to understand.

WASHU
Tokimi.

Sasami lowers her hand.

She kisses Washu on the cheek.

She moves back to look into Washu's eyes.

SASAMI
Please take care of yourself Little Washu.  We all love you.

Sasami turns and walks out of the onsen.

Washu slowly sinks down to the bench.

Her forgotten cargo shorts still in her hands.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

Kazuhiko sits at the end farthest from the kitchen with Mihoshi on his
right.

Kiyone sits on the side to Mihoshi's right.

Tenchi enters the room and sits at his spot.

TENCHI
Where is everybody?

Sasami enters the room and sits opposite Tenchi.

SASAMI
Washu is still getting ready.  Ryoko and Ayeka are sharing cooking
duties with Ryo-Ouki's help.

MIHOSHI
I'm not really hungry tonight.  I think I'll turn in early.

TENCHI
Please stay for dinner Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
But...

Kazuhiko reaches over and squeezes Mihoshi's hand.

KAZUHIKO
It'll be all right.

Mihoshi frowns and nods her head.

She looks down at her lap.

Ayeka and Ryoko come in carrying the main course.

Ryo-Ouki follows behind carrying the soup

RYOKO
Dinner is served.

RYO-OUKI
Miya!

Ayeka and Ryoko set the food down and sit to either side of Tenchi.

Ryo-Ouki sets the soup down and starts ladling it into bowls.

After she is finished she sits next to Sasami.

Washu enters the room.

WASHU
Yoshou and Tsunami won't be joining us tonight.

Washu sits to Sasami's right.

WASHU
This looks really good!  Who did the cooking tonight?

RYOKO
Ayeka and myself mother.

Washu nods.

WASHU
Both of you have turned out to be excellent wives.  I'm so proud of you
Ryoko, and you too Ayeka.

AYEKA
Thank you Ms. Washu.

Everyone begins eating.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

The meal is finished.

Washu nods at Tenchi.

Tenchi stands up and moves over to kneel behind Mihoshi and Kazuhiko.

WASHU
Mihoshi, there's some questions I'd like to ask you.

Mihoshi can barely speak.

MIHOSHI
Okay.

Washu's keyboard appears in front of her.

WASHU
How old is your mother?

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu, I don't thi...

WASHU (overlapping)
Really Mihoshi!  I'm well over 20,000 years.

Mihoshi's eyes have that deer lost in the headlights look.

KAZUHIKO
I...

Tenchi reaches out and squeezes Kazuhiko's shoulder.

MIHOSHI
She turned 918 on her last birthday.

Washu nods and taps a command on the keyboard.

WASHU
How old was your grandmother when she died?

MIHOSHI
She was 1,862 when she died.

WASHU
You were twelve at the time.

Mihoshi nods.

WASHU
Why do you call Marshall Anderson your grandfather?

MIHOSHI
He is my grandfather.

Washu stares at Mihoshi for a moment.

WASHU
Maybe I should ask who was your mother's father?

Mihoshi begins to cry.

MIHOSHI
He had died long before I was born.

WASHU
His name was Hoishi Kan

Mihoshi nods.

WASHU
He died at the age of 37.  Your mother was his only child.  Actually
she was your grandmother's only child.

Mihoshi nods again.

WASHU
You're your mother's only child.  How many husbands has she had?

MIHOSHI
Five

WASHU
And your grandmother had seven husbands with the Marshall being her last.

MIHOSHI
When I was growing up he was the only grandfather I knew. He always
treated me as his own.  Even after I learned the truth.

WASHU
You grew up on Balbeisan

MIHOSHI
Yes.

WASHU
Your great grandmother had a brother.  A fraternal twin, but he died at
the age of 112 while your great grandmother lived to be 1,792.  Her
married name was Ahiko Morikawa.

Mihoshi nods.

WASHU
She immigrated to Balbeisan.  Can you tell me her family name and from
where she immigrated?

Mihoshi wipes her eyes.

She looks up at Washu.

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu?  If I ask you to stop looking into my past...  Will you?

Washu looks around the room at everyone.

Her shoulders slump.

WASHU
Yes.

Washu stands up and moves to the exit.

MIHOSHI
Her name was Ahiko Kanachoku.

Washu stops and slowly turns.

WASHU
What?

MIHOSHI
Her name was Ahiko Kanachoku when she immigrated from Hekisui.

WASHU
Thank you.

MIHOSHI
I'll hold you to your promise to stop looking into my past when I ask.

Washu walks out of the room.

TENCHI
Thank you Mihoshi.

Mihoshi smiles in return.

FADE OUT:

THE END
