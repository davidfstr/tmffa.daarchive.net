CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Boku wa moto Pioneer" by Chisa Yokoyama(with much the same look as
OVA2 opening but including Kiyone, Seion, Demi, The Knights, Nagi, Misaki, Megumi and all those
adorable little cabbits.

	SCENE: The Masaki residence. Outdoors. The gang is playing football. They wear the
following jerseys:

	  Girls Team		  Guys team
	Ryoko-Buccaneers #69	Tenchi-Browns #4
	Aeka-Vikings #7		Seion-Bengals #77
	Nagi-Raiders #66	Asaka-Colts #54
	Washu-Chiefs #58	Yosho-same old outfit
	Kiyone-Eagles #1	Noboyuki-Cowboys #12
	Megumi-Jets #00		Kamadake-Chargers #54
	Demi-Lions #20 		Keiichi-Seahawks #80

			on the sidelines
	Sasami-Dolphins #13
	Tsunami-Dolphins #26
	Misaki-Dolphins #52(Misaki thought it would be so KAWAII if they all wore the same
team)
	Mihoshi-Cardinals #36(the 36 seems to be the wrong size for Mihoshi because the
numbers are.....never mind)

	The guys are losing 77-21. Noboyuki is the QB.
	NOBOYUKI: HIKE! 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 36: NO NEED FOR BABY!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	(NOBOYUKI IS SACKED BY KIYONE....again. The guys huddle to discuss their next course
of action)
	SEION: THAT'S SEVEN TIMES KIYONE HAS SACKED YOUR WORTHLESS ASS!
	NOBOYUKI: Hey now! Don't blame me. I'm sure we'd all like to be taken down by her-
	SEION: THAT'S MY SISTER!(to Tenchi) And you! 6 turnovers! And that last one you HANDED
to Aeka! And Asaka. Kamadake. I thought you two were above letting the girls win just for a
little action later on! 3 fumbles each! And I know Megumi isn't strong enough to strip the
ball!
	KAMADAKE: It's not the ball I want her to strip.(smiles)
	TENCHI: You'd run over your own sister over to win, wouldn't you?
	SEION: I already did five times! I scored three touchdowns!
	NOBOYUKI: C'mon! It's only a game!
	SEION: This is no longer a game! It's a crusade! I-
	KIYONE:(offscreen) HURRY UP! You're on the clock!(The break the huddle)
	SEION: Get me the ball!(meanwhile, on the girls side)
	RYOKO: What should we do this time?
	AEKA: I think I'll occuppy Lord Tenchi while you run the ball in for the score.
	RYOKO: Sounds like a plan to me! Nagi, you cover Seion!
	NAGI: WHAT?!! He's a madman!
	WASHU: Don't worry! It'll work out! Kiyone ain't gonna blitz this time so Mr. Masaki'll
be free to pass to Seion and Tenchi.
	NAGI: I hope you're right.
	NOBOYUKI: HIKE!(The play starts. Noboyuki throws a perfect pass to Tenchi. Seion is
running a block for him. Seion then sees Nagi, gets a devilish grin on his face, and does a
flying shoulder block into Nagi.)
	SASAMI: AND LOOK AT HIM GO!
	MIHOSHI: HE COULD GO...
	MISAKI: ALL....
	TSUNAMI: THE...
	SASAMI: WAY!(Just then we see something at the goaline that might stop Tenchi from
scoring.... Aeka and Ryoko.) Or maybe not!
	RYOKO: Hand it over.
	AEKA: Yes, Lord Tenchi. Why would you ever want to handle something made from such
rough skin when you can caress my perfect skin?(Tenchi drops the ball. Ryoko picks it up
and takes off)
	SEION: NOOOOOOOOO! NOT THIS TIME!(Seion dives at Ryoko's feet and grabs them.
Problem is Ryoko is flying and dragging Seion down field) YOU-(Ryoko boots him in the
face)-OW! AIN'T(Kick!) ARGH! GONNA(Stomp!) D'OH! SCORE-(Heel smash) OUCH! THIS TIME!(And
with that Seion digs his feet in and applies the brakes, finally stopping Ryoko) Heh-heh!
I stopped you just short of the goaline!(Then Ryoko points out that even though he stopped
her just short of the line, the ball was well across the line, thus resulting in another
touchdown for the girls) D'OH! D'OH!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE 2: The Masaki House

	The phone rings. Tnechi picks it up.

	TENCHI: Hello? Hey, Junko! How you been doing. I'm fine. Will I what? I'd like to,
but me, dad, grandpa, and a few friends are going to play some golf today. Well, there are
a few girls living in the house with us. Who are they? Uh....just a few college students
and Dad's fiance. I'm sure they'd love to help out. Well, when will you be hear? Your
coming up the driveway now? I see you two have a carphone now. Alright, I'll let them know.
See you in a minute. Bye. (He hangs the phone up.) GIRLS! I have a suprise for you!
	(Out of the blue, Aeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi and Misaki appear.)

	AEKA: Is it flowers?
	RYOKO: A bottle of sake?
	MISAKI: An engagment ring for my Little Aeka?
	WASHU: That sample I've been trying to get?
	SASAMI: I hope it's candy!
	MIHOSHI: Me too!
	TENCHI: No, it's something else. Something you'll like even better.
	(Seion enters the room)
	SEION: You must mean me.
	TENCHI: NO I DIDN'T!
	RYOKO: Well, what is it then?
	
	(And with that question there is a knock at the door. Nagi goes to answer it.)
	NAGI: Yes, who is it? (Just then diapers, bottles, baby formula, toys, baby clothes,
car seat, and baby blanket appear in Nagi's arms.)
	JUNKO: Well, I think that's everything! Wait a minute. What am I forgeting, Hamato?
	HAMATO: Let me see.......
	JUNKO&HAMATO: TARO!
	(Tenchi and Seion come to the door)
	SEION: What in the world is a Taro?
	(Junko hands Tenchi said Taro)
	TENCHI: Taro is my baby cousin.
	SEION:(with a terrified look on his face) A ba-...a ba-
	JUNKO: No, not a ba. A baby.
	SEION: A BABY?!! AAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHH! (and with a cloud of dust, Seion
dissappears.)
	JUNKO: What's with the big guy?
	TENCHI: I think we finally found something he's afraid of.
	HAMATO: Huh. Well, we'll be off. See you later.
	TENCHI: When will you be back?
	JUNKO: Tomorrow evening sometime. Bye now!(she kisses Taro) Bye my little angel.
	(Junko and Hamato get in their car and head off. Tenchi walks back in the house with
Taro in his arms and goes to wherethe girls are.)
	TENCHI: Here's the suprise.
	AEKA: Oh! How sweet! A baby!
	RYOKO: A ba-
	TENCHI: No, not a ba. A baby.
	RYOKO: A BABY?!! ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!(Ryoko heads for her rafter. From the
rafter a scuffle is heard)
	RYOKO: HEY! What are you doing on my rafter?
	SEION: I was here first!
	RYOKO: But it's my rafter!
	SEION: I don't see your name on it!
	RYOKO: It's carved right here!
	SEION: Oh, so your full name is Ryoko N. Tenchi?
	RYOKO: BAKA! (and down comes Seion)
	SEION: (looks at Taro) AAAHHHHH! (and with another cloud of dust, he's gone.)
	SASAMI: Oh boy! A little baby! What's his name?
	TENCHI: Taro.
	MISAKI: Taro-chan? Can I hold him?
	TENCHI: Uh, I'm not sure if...(she takes him anyway)
	MISAKI: (in ultra-Kawaiiese) How is my widdle Taro-chan? You are just so KAWAII! One
of the most kawaii babies I've ever seen!
	SASAMI: Even more than me, mommy?
	MISAKI: Don't be silly, Sasami-chan! Nobody was ever as kawaii as you were when you
were just a widdle baby! I'll go get the baby pictures!(she hands Taro to Aeka) Here.
Practice being a mommy! Be back in a little while!(she leaves to go retrieve the 36 baby
picture albums.)
	AEKA: Hello, Taro-chan. My name is Aeka.
	TARO: Da-da! 
	AEKA: DA-DA! No, I'm not your father!
	TENCHI: Don't worry, Aeka. It's the first sound all babies make.
	AEKA: Oh, thank goodness.
	(Kiyone and Noboyuki enter the room)
	KIYONE: ...And remeber to call me at work if you are going to be late tonight, alright
Dear?
	NOBOYUKI: I will. You can- Well! Look who's here! It's Taro!
	KIYONE: Who's Taro?(She then see's the little tike) Oh! How sweet! A baby!
	TENCHI: Yeah. I was hoping that the girls would want to take care of them today.
	KIYONE: Not today! We're getting that shipment of pointsettas in today for Christmas.
You boys will have to stay here today and do it.(and with that remark, Seion appears.)
	SEION: Like hell we are! As eldest male in the Makibi Clan I say that I'm going to play
golf!
	KIYONE: And as the eldest female in the Makibi Clan I say you're STAYING!
	SEION:...yes ma'am. Let's go put our clubs up, guys. (As Tenchi and Noboyuki trudge
upstairs, Seion stops and whispers something containing the word "distraction" in Mihoshi's
ear and then follows his soon-to-be in-laws.)
	MIHOSHI: Um, excuse me! Can I say something?
	WASHU: What is it, Mihoshi?
	MIHOSHI: Well, you remember when we were in the Academy and we had to take care of a
baby? Well we...(As Mihoshi distracts away we see Asaka and Kamadake outside the window
catching golf bags.)But we didn't have any milk so we had to.. (Tenchi then goes by the
window downwards and lands on his feet and heads for the van.) And then, and then we had
to change her diapers, so we... (Seion then appears and lands on his hands and springs to
the van.) And she just wouldn't go to sleep so I started singing... (Noboyuki just falls
and lands in the shrubbery.)..I float, I sway,/ in my sleep /Over the slumberland you know,/
the happiness lies...(As Yosho helps him out, Kiyone comes to the window and yells to her
brother.)
	KIYONE: SEION MAKIBI! YOU'RE A DEAD MAN!
	WASHU: Well, Misaki, Nagi and I can look after the little one until you get back!
	AEKA: Oh! But I want to spend the day with him! Can we take him to work with us?
	MIHOSHI: Come on Kiyone, let's do it!
	KIYONE: No.
	MISAKI: You know you want to, Kiyone!
	KIYONE: I told you. We're going to be really busy today!
	SASAMI: Please?
	KIYONE: ABSOLUTLEY NOT! (the scene shifts to the flower shop where ALL of the girls,
including Megumi and Demi, are helping out.) How did I let myself get talked into this?(she
then looks at Taro and finds her answer)

SCENE 3: GOLF! 
	
	Everyone is dressed for golf, which means the only change to Yosho's outfit is golf
shoes.

	SEION: So...Who goes first?
	TENCHI: Dad, then me, then Grampa, then you.
	NOBOYUKI: Outta the way, son. Let me show you how to play this game.(Noboyuki lines
up his shot, swings, and send his ball over the sand trap, clears the water hazard, and
places it 50 yrds from the green.)
	SEION: Ooooo! So close! You're turn Tenchi. (Tenchi takes his shot, just edging the
water)
	YOSHO: Hmm. You need more practice, Tenchi. Let me show you how. (Yosho's shot is a
great shot....if you're trying to intentionally put your ball in the bunker)
	TENCHI: Nice shot, Grampa. Your turn, Seion
	SEION: Let me show you how to drive a ball!(Seion crushes the ball, sending it 100
yrds past the green into the trees) Game's over. I win. (the other three just start looking
around, not saying anything) What?

SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)

=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: Ryoko sitting on the rooftop
	RYOKO: Freedom. One of our most basic rights. We take it for granted. Our government
gives us the freedom to religion, the freedom of press,and the freedom of free speech. Yet
that freedom can be taken away by the very government that provides it. Something to think
about from the people at...(She pulls out a VERY large and VERY empty sake bottle) the people
at...(looks at the bottle closely) The people at...(Looks at it again) The people who make
thish wonderffful shake in thish little bottle.(She passes out.)
	DIRECTOR: CUT! Get her off the set! Bring the other actress in(Seion walks into the
scene, picks Ryoko up, puts her over his shoulder, and takes her off the set. Tenchi and
Aeka bring the next actress in, one Misato Katsuragi. As Seion sets Ryoko down next to the
first actress to get blasted on the set, Ayaka Kisuragi to be exact, he pulls out a Snickers
bar.)
	ANNOUNCER: Not going anywhere for a while? Grab a Snickers.
	MISATO: WHOOOOO-HOOOO! This is some good sake!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)

SCENE 4: The Flower Shop. 

	"Misato's Theme" is playing in the backround over the sound system. Kiyone, Nagi,
Mihoshi, and Misaki are in the back with Taro. They are looking through the photo albums.

	MISAKI: And this was Sasami when she first starting crawling! Isn't she so cute?
	KIYONE: Hey! The two girls in this picture with Aeka look familiar.
	NAGI: D-don't be silly! They look like two normal, average, unknown girls to me.
	MIHOSHI: Kiyone's right! That girl there looks just like Ryoko! And this one looks
like you, Nagi!
	KIYONE: Nagi? You're right! It IS Nagi and Ryoko! Did you know this, Misaki!
	MISAKI: Sure! Aeka and Ryoko used to be best friends until they got into a fight
over who stole who's flower wreath. To tell the truth, Nagi made it but just left it on
the ground. Aeka picked it up and wrore it like she was already the Queen! Oh, it was just
so cute to see her giving out royal proclomations and claiming land in the name of Jurai!
	NAGI: Great! Now everyone knows that Ryoko's my little sister!
	MIHOSHI: Ryoko's your sister? (just then, Sasami burst into the room)
	SASAMI: Kiyone! The delivery truck's here!
	KIYONE: I'll be right out, Sammy! You take your allergy medicine, Mihoshi?
	MIHOSHI: Sure did! Let's go!
	MISAKI: Oooo! Are they pretty flowers?
	KIYONE: I'll say they are. 
	MISAKI: I'll come and help arrange them! Ikebana is a hobby of mine!
	KIYONE: Thanks! Nagi, Could you look after Taro until we're done?
	NAGI: <sigh> I guess.
	KIYONE: Thanks.(they leave)
	NAGI: (looking over her shoulder to make sure nobody is watching and then talking
to Taro)
	How is my little iddy, biddy Taro? You are so cute! Yes you are! Got your nose! Got
your nose! Heh-heh!(Taro is making baby noises as if he's enjoying himself) Here's something
you might like! (Nagi cups her mouth over Taro's tummy and begins blowing out, making that
sound that we all know. Nagi does this a few times, getting baby laughter each time, until
she just freezes, realizing that someone is watching her. Ryoko and Aeka are at the door
recording the whole thing) 
	RYOKO: Look. It's big, bad Nagi, the toughest bounty hunter who ever lived.
	AEKA: My, my. I never thought I would ever see her put on such a spectical.
	NAGI: It's not how it looks.
	AEKA: It looks like you where playing with Taro and having a little fun while doing
it.
	NAGI: Oh, so it is how it looks.

SCENE 5: MORE GOLF!

	Tenchi is adding up the scores

	TENCHI: Let's see now...Dad is at -2, I'm at 2 over, Grampa's at 5 over, and Seion
is at an amazing 23 over.
	SEION: See, I'm winning. I've got 23 points!
	TENCHI: The idea is to have the LOWEST score! The sad part is it's only the front 9!
	SEION: You mean that your loser at every sport he ever tried father is kicking our
asses and we ain't even half done?
	NOBOYUKI: Well, I am our prefeture's amature golf champion over the past seven years.
	SEION: Shut up!

SCENE 6: Back at the Shop

	The Miho-Misa (tee-hee) are trying to feed Taro in Kiyone's office.

	MIHOSHI: Come on! You need to eat, Taro! Why won't you take your bottle!(Looks to
Misaki) Why won't he take his bottle?
	MISAKI: Well how should I know?
	MIHOSHI: I thought you were a mommy!
	MISAKI: I am Queen of Jurai. I had servants to help with the feeding and the
cleaning! The only time I ever fed my little girls is when I was-
	TARO: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! (Kiyone enters the room)
	KIYONE: What's wrong with him now?
	MIHOSHI:(crying along with Taro) He won't take his bottle! 
	MISAKI: (crying also) And we don't know why!
	KIYONE: Let me see that.(Kiyone checks the temperature bottle and turns ice blue)
IT'S F-f-f-freezing! Go heat this up in the microwave for a a minute. He needs it at-(Kiyone
gets a shocked look on her face and then starts blushing. She then looks down at Taro and
see's that he is trying to "nurse" on his very own).....about 98.6 degrees. And please hurry.
	MISAKI: That's what I did to feed my little girls, Kiyone. You look so natural with
a child. You'd make a great Mommy! Have you had experience raising children?
	MIHOSHI: Uh, Kiyone. How long do I heat it up?
	KIYONE: You could say that, Misaki.

SCENE 7: GOLF MUYO!

	The 18th hole!

	TENCHI: And the scores coming up to the last hole are, Dad at 5 under, Me at 2 over,
Grampa at 3 over, and Seion at an astonishing 36 over par!
	SEION: If you keep it up I'm gonna break my driver off on your Royal ass!
	NOBOYUKI: Just drive the ball, Seion.
	SEION: Yeah, yeah, yeah.(Seion drives the ball...right into the lake. Seion turns red,
grinds his teeth, and starts fuming) I HATE THIS STUPID-ASS GAME! (he then flings his club far
down the golf course. Meanwhile...at the 18th green, Ranma, Akane, Mousse, and Shampoo are
gathered around two balls)
	RANMA: HA! All I have to do is make this putt and I win, which means Shampoo is still
mine!
	AKANE: Stupid jerk! I hope you screw it up so bad!
	MOUSSE: Mr. Perfect? Screw up? 
	SHAMPOO: It never happen.
	RANMA: Just shut up and watch.(As Ranma lines up his shot, a familiar looking club
comes flying in and clobbers the greatest martial artist is Japan right in his arrogant
noggin, Knocking his out cold and knocking Mousse's ball in for the win.)
	SHAMPOO: Stupid looser Ranma! Shampoo have nothing more to do with you! Let's go,
Mousse.
(They step on Ranma's carcass as the leave.)
	AKANE: Get up! You sexist pig! You're gonna get it when we get back home!(She grabs
him by the collar and drags him off.)

SCENE 8: Back at home.

	Noboyuki and Kiyone are in their room talking about their day.

	NOBOYUKI: ...Seion knocked out some pig-tailed guy on the last hole. But I fininshed
at six under. It was the best round I played in my life. So, was Taro a problem for you?
	KIYONE: Oh no! He was just wonderful. Washu was a great help today. She knew just
about everything to do at the shop. But Taro got me to thinking.
	NOBOYUKI: About what? (Kiyone embraces Noboyuki, forces him down on the bed and
kisses him about his face) You're being real amourous tonight. What's the occasion?
KIYONE: I want a baby!

SCENE 8: Ae&Ryo's room.

	Ryoko and Aeka are passed out from fatigue. Aeka is sitting up on the couch. Ryoko
has her head in Aeka's lap. Taro is crying. 

	MIHOSHI: (offscreen down the hallway) Don't forget my Cherry-Chocolate Ice cream!
	SEION: I won't. Be back in a jiff!(Seion goes by the door and see's the scene) Oh
boy.(he eneters the room) Just look at you two.(He picks Ryoko up and puts her to bed)
You're trying so hard to be good mothers, but you missing a father to give you a break
once in a while.(He puts Aeka to bed) But at least you are trying. (he looks to Taro)
And now for you. What's all the fuss about? Please don't tell me it's the diaper. (He
checks) Thank heavens! And you don't seem to be hungry. You must want someone to put you
to sleep. You need music. (he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small crystal flute and
starts playing that music that plays when Ryoko is talking about Tenchi when he was growing
up from the OVA series. Little does he know that Mihoshi, Kiyone, Tenchi and Sasami are at the
door watching him)
	TENCHI: (whispering) Did you know he could play a flute?
	MIHOSHI: No. This is the first time I've seen him do it.
	KIYONE: He's been playing for years. Mom taught both of us.
	SASAMI: You really are a lucky girl to have a guy like him, Mihoshi. 
	MIHOSHI: Thank you, Sasami.
	SEION: (to himself) Yes, thank you, Princess.
