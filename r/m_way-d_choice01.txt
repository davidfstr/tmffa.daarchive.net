A Mothers Way, A Daughters Choice
	By WASHURYOKO

	Well I have a lot of good Ideas but just not good at writing them down.  I 
tried my best to write it though.  This is only my second fanfiction, so bare 
with me.  Also I have a lot of them coming out but they are all based on washu 
and ryoko.  (they are my favorite characters)Just based on different things.  
They are all Big "could happen" stories.


Disclaimer:  Tenchi Muyo! and the related characters belong to AIC, Pioneer, and 
other people.


Chapter 1:  It begins

	It was one nice and sunny day at the Masaki residence. Ayeka and Mihoshi 
peacefully did there chores.  Sasami in the kitchen cooking for dinner.  While 
at the same time making sure Ryo-oki did not touch the carrots.  Of course Ryoko 
like always, bothering Tenchi while he tried to work on the field.      
In the lab.......
	Washu stood Motionless against the speaciment tank.  She could not work 
today.  For it was the day that Kagato took Ryoko from her.  She could not help  
to wonder if she could've prevented it from happening.  Not only did she get 
locked in some other dimension, but she lost her child.  Well not really, but 
that's how it felt.  Ryoko did not see her as her mother but as a creator.  But 
there was more than that to it.  Washu had a secret that no one knew about.  
Something that would not make Ryoko look at her as a creator.  It would make her 
see the truth.  It could possibly hurt her too, or even make Ryoko hate her.  
She was sure not ready to tell her.  She could barely have a conversation.  And 
hoped that it would change.  If only Ryoko knew how much she loved her, she 
would not push her away.  Every night before Washu had went to sleep, she would 
walk up to Ryoko's room and would sit next to her bed, and just stare at her 
daughter while she slept.  Ryoko was so peaceful when she was sleep.  Like she 
had no worries in the world.  That was the only way Washu could really be near 
Ryoko or even touch her.  Before she left the room she would lay a kiss on 
Ryoko's cheek, and make sure that she was tucked in.  Washu tried to do this 
every night.  Ryoko would probably be furious if she knew. 

Sasami:  Washu dinners ready!  Washu! Washu!
Washu:  Oh, Sorry, im a little out today.
Sasami:  Are you ok?
Washu:  Yeah, Come on lets go eat.

	Sasami and Washu came in to the kitchen to see everyone sitting down 
eating.  Washu sat down at the table as Sasami placed her plate in front of her.  
While eating Washu turned toward Ryoko as if she wanted to say something.  Ryoko 
noticed this and looked back and opened the link.

Ryoko:  (Something you want Washu)
Washu:  (I was wondering if you could come up to the roof with me after dinner 
to talk.)
Ryoko:  (I don't feel like talking)
Washu:  (Ryoko all im asking is to talk, no harm done)
Ryoko:  (Fine, but this better be worth it).
 {

[Authers thoughts:  Always happens like this, doesn't it.]}

Tenchi:  what have you been doing all day Washu?  
Washu:  Oh how sweet Tenchi, you were worried about me
	Washu puts her hands around Tenchi.  Washu did that just to make Ayeka and 
Ryoko mad.  Ayeka and Ryoko got up.
Ayeka:  Miiiiisssss Washu, what do you think your doing
Ryoko:  Hey Washu get off of him.
Ayeka:  Ryoko you should watch your mother
Ryoko:  What?  Shut up Ayeka
		They start to fight and Mihoshi tries to break it up. Everyone else 
tends to the kitchen and walks into the liver room.  Washu goes to the roof to 
wait for Ryoko.
**********************
Ryoko:  Well im here so start talking.
Washu:  I see you got away from you rival
Ryoko:  Washu what do you want
Washu:  Ryoko, tell me why you push me away
Ryoko:  I should have known.(sigh) I don't know
Washu: Yes you do, you just don't want to say it
Ryoko:  Washu im tired of all these little talks.  So im going to tell you why.  
Sometimes I don't know why, but I think its because you let Kagato take me.  
When you think about it, I don't know you.  I don't know how it was before 
everything.  So its hard for me to express my self to you.  You told me that you 
were my creator, as the same thing that Kagato told me.  And just the sound of 
that made me feel weird.  It made me feel like I was a robot, an experiment, 
when all I wanted was to be like Tenchi and everyone else.  It hurts that Im not 
real. I don't know. 
	Ryoko phases away.  Washu sits there with  tears in her eye.  
Washu:  Only way to make Ryoko know the truth is to tell her the secret, but I 
don't think she can handle it.
**********************
 Part 1: Later that night.....................
			Everyone had went to sleep.  Even Ryoko.  Washu walked up the 
stairs to Ryoko's room and quietly opened the door.  She walked in and sat on a 
chair next to Ryoko's bed.  Washu laid her head on the head post of the bed.  
She looked down on Ryoko.

Washu:  Ryoko I have something to tell you.  You are not an experiment like you 
think.  You are real whether you believe or not I wish I could tell you how but 
Im scared.  I don't want you to hate me more than you do now.  I don't want you 
to look at me like you looked at Kagato.
	Washu sighed.
Washu:  If only I could talk to you while you were awake
	Washu sat there thinking about what had happen over the years in Ryoko's 
life, while she was looked in that crystal kagato put her in.    	
*********************************
	(2:00) Ryoko wakes up and feels something against her
Ryoko:  Washu what are you doing in here? She always finds a way.  I don't feel 
like waking her so...
	Ryoko lefts Washu up and puts her in her bed.  She lays beside her.
Ryoko:  I hope no one finds out about this
*************
Daylight.................
		Washu wakes up.  She looks around and sees no sight of Ryoko.
Washu:  Oh no, how could I fall asleep, and how did I get here in Ryoko's bed.  
		Washu opens the door to the room and peeks to see if anyone is out 
there.  She quietly walks down the stairs and hears Sasami cooking breakfast. 
Sasami:  Hey Washu, breakfast will be done soon
Washu:  Sasami have you seen Ryoko
Sasami:  Yeah, she was on the roof the last I saw.  Why do you want her?
Washu:  No reason
	Washu walks in her lab and sits down on her cushion and starts to type.  
							Ryoko walks into the kitchen
Ryoko:  Hey Sasami, need any help.
Sasami:  Well im almost done, but you can help me set the table.
Ryoko:  Well all right. 

	Ryoko starts to set the table.
Ryoko:  Hey Sasami, have you seen Washu yet?
Sasami:  Yeah she wanted to know where you were.  Something wrong?
Ryoko:  No, I just wanted to know
Sasami:  Well Ryoko can you get Washu for breakfast.  I'll get Tenchi and 
everyone else.

	Ryoko was about to tell Sasami that she would get everyone else but She 
was gone before she could finish.
Ryoko:  Here goes.(Ryoko says walking in to the lab.)Washu!
Washu:  Over here Ryoko.
  	Washu was surprise to here Ryoko's Voice. (What would she tell Ryoko about 
being in her room.)
Ryoko:  Sasami told me get you for breakfast
Washu:  Thanks 
Ryoko:  Washu
W ashu: yes
Ryoko:  Why were you in my room
Washu:  I don't know
Ryoko:  you don't know, how can you not know.  
Washu:  Ryoko I 'm not going to lye to you, I care about you.  Ryoko its hard to 
deal with your daughter not loving you as you love them.
Ryoko:  washu that still doesn't tell me why you were in my room.
Washu:  don't you see, I was there to be near you, my daughter,YOU.  I wanted to 
make sure that you were tucked in and to say good night.  Is that a crime.
Ryoko:  Well no, but next time just say goodnight, don't come into my room.
Washu:  Ryoko why do you treat me like this?  You don't give me any chances. 
	Mother and Daughter sat there looking at each other
Ryoko:  Washu I just can't take it. I don't want it to be this way, but I don't 
know what to do.
Washu:  Let me love you, and you love me back
Ryoko:  I can't, I don't know how, I am not real remember.
Washu:  Ryoko stop!  Just stop it!  You know as well as I do that you are real
Ryoko:  Then how come I don't feel that way
	Washu turns around to face away from Ryoko
Washu:  Listen my daughter, I have something very important to tell you.  I 
don't know if your going to like it or not.  I don't know if you will hate me or 
not.  
Ryoko:  What is it about?
Washu:  You want to know if you are real or not.  I will tell you but you must 
promise me that after, you will not run, but talk to me.  Promise!
	Ryoko thought about it for a while.  What ever washu had in store for her 
did not sound good.  But Ryoko wanted to find out.
Ryoko:  I promise!
Washu:  You might want to have a seat
	Washu said calling cushions to come up from the floor.  Ryoko sat down, 
Washu sat next to her.  She wanted to make sure that if Ryoko was going to hate 
her after this, that she at least get to be with her one more time.
**
Washu:  Well Ryoko, I want to start to say that you are real because you were 
not made but born as Tenchi was.
Ryoko:  What I was born.  Washu--
Washu:  Please, let me finish.  You were the one that was taken from me.  My 
only child, my blood.  (Washu took Ryoko's hand in hers.)  You are my lost 
child.  Kagato took you from me.  I thought I could trust him because- because--
---
Ryoko:  Because of what Washu?  Tell me! Tell me!
	Ryoko could see tears coming to Washu's eyes.
Washu:  Because he was your father.
	Ryoko's eyes went wide at this
Ryoko:  Noooooooooo
