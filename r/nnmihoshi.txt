No Need For Mihoshi!
by Mark Doherty (mdoherty@mailbox.uq.edu.au)

Kiyone straightened her uniform as she stood outside her commander's 
office. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity of the hell that was 
Mihoshi, she was going to get a new partner.

Mihoshi had retired from the Galactic Police after Washu had remembered 
that on the planet Gio, they had a rather innovative system of marriage 
where you could have up to twenty wives. Apparently, after Tenchi woke up 
from the anaesthetic the girls had given to him, he had found himself 
signed and sealed with enough wives to raise an eyebrow even on that 
planet.

Still, at least all the girls were sort of happy. Until the matter of who
got the first night of the honeymoon came up.

Oh well, it's not as if anyone had really needed that planet anyway.

Kiyone walked into her commander's office, stood before his desk, and gave
a sharp salute.

"You wanted to see me sir?"

"That's right, Officer Kiyone. Now, you do realise that since your partner 
has... retired, that you need a new partner."

"Yes sir."

"Well, anyway, we've selected one for you."

Kiyone, not moving an inch from her stand-at-attention stance, started to
pray to her gods that she got someone calm, intelligent, and good in a 
fight.

"In fact, your new partner sort of insisted being paired with you. With 
her political position, we couldn't really refuse."

Kiyone started to sweat. This sounded suspiciously like the speech she was
given when she was paired with Mihoshi.

"Yes, she's a princess of her own people. Anyway, Officer Kiyone, I'd like 
you to meet your new partner."

A small blonde girl, with a flower in her hair, walked into the office. 
She looked at her dark-haired partner, and smiled. "Hiiiii!" she said in 
an annoying, whiny voice. "I'm Shiko! Here, I made you some lunch as a 
gift."

And hell did begin anew...
