Innocent I tell ya!  thanks now to the story!

WARNING!: i am not gonna explain what's going on, ok? that wastes time, i'm
sorry, but i find that so annoying!!

   on to the story!


              Tenchi just sat.  He could feel everyone staring at him,
trying
to think of something to say.  Ayeka kept making little noises in her
throat,
as if she was trying to say something but couldn't get it out.
Finally, Sasami broke the silence.
" Tenchi! I'm scared!" She wailed.  Tears streamed down her throat.  Tenchi
didn't even look up.  Her voice seemed so far away...Dad...He was always
acting goofy, but he was still my Father.  Is he dead?  That thought kept
coming to him.  Are they all dead?  Washuu? Kiyone? Dad?  Who is doing
this!?

Sasami, hurt by being ignored by Tenchi, cried louder, not wanting to act
like a baby, but not being able to stop herself.  She didn't want to
disappear.
Ayeka walked over to her little sister.
" It's all right Sasami, everything will be alright!  Won't Sunami help you
if you get into trouble?"  She said trying to calm her beloved sister down.
That got Tenchi's attention.  Sunami!  Why hadn't he thought of that!?
Surely
she could help them!
Everyone else seemed to be thinking the same thing, because they all looked
at Sasami hopefully.
She gulped.  Sasami looked at all their hopeful faces.  Sighing, she tried
to
:talk
 with Sunami.  They didn't really talk to each other, they could
just....exchange feelings.  It was strange, but to Sasami, it felt natural,
she couldn't explain this exactly to anyone else.
After a few minutes, Sasami looked up.  She had a panicked expression on her
face.
    Ayeka, looking at her sisters terrified face, began to shiver.
    Tenchi noticed it too, but wasn't sure what to say.
" What's wrong?"  Asked Mihoshi finally.  " You look really scared Sasami!
Are you feeling ok?"  Sasami gulped.
" I-I-" she faltered.  Tenchi, never having a younger sibling, wasn't sure
what to do, but Ayeka did.  She grasped Sasami's shoulders and looked at
her.
" Sasami, tell us what is the matter!?" she asked firmly.  The look that
Sasami gave her went right to her heart.  It was a look of complete loss, of
no hope, emptiness.
" She's gone, I'm empty! She's gone!"  Sasami felt like she was screaming,
this feeling overwelmed her, she felt empty, like she had lost a part of her
mind.  Gasping she turned around.  Ryoko was looking at her with concern.
Then she felt the floor rising, and she knew no more.

Ryoko looked at Sasami in puzlement.  What is wrong with this kid?  She
looks
like she saw a ghost!   Ryoko, having excellent reflexes, knew Sasami was
going to collapse just before she fell.  Ryoko caught her as she slumped to
the ground.
" Sasami!" cried Mihoshi, Tenchi, and Ayeka at once.
" My goodness! Is she alright!? What's happened?"  asked Ayeka.
" Be quiet! Would ya? Of course she's alright! Do you think she's dead or
something?"  Ryoko snarled.  Tenchi stepped forward.
" Grandfather, do you know what happened to Sasami?" He asked.
" I know not, let's take her to her bed, it is most likely Sasami has
fainted
from shock.
"  Shock from what?"  Mihoshi wondered aloud.
" I don't know"  Yosho answered.

                           ***************************************

        Everyone was gathered around Sasami's bed, where she lay lying.
Well, almost everyone, Mishoshi had went to take a nap in her room, which
was
right next to Sasami's room.
Yosho seemed to be concentrating very hard, like he was in a trance.  Tenchi
had seen him doing this while he was praying, so he knew it would be better
to not bother him for a few minutes.
Ayeka shook her head.  " I just don't understand, what's going on!?"
Ryoko looked at her.  " What did you say she said right before she fainted?"
Ayeka gave her an annoyed look.  " She said something about someone being
gone, that  she was empty"
" Well it's obvious, isn't it?" Tenchi said at last.  Ryoko and Ayeka stared
at him, telling him that it was plainly not obvious.  Tenchi blushed.
" Well, we asked--I asked her about Sunami, so she must have been talking
about Sunami."
" Your right! So-so, she meant that Sunami was gone!" Ryoko exclaimed.
" Don't be stupid!  That's not possible, how could Sunami be gone!  Don't
you
agree Lord Tenchi?"  Ayeka said anxiously.  Both glared at each other, and
then turned and glared at Tenchi.  Tenchi sort of laughed, as he put his arm
behind his back.
" Ah-ah-" But thankfully Yosho interuppted him.
" I believe Sasami meant that Sunami could not be reached by her, and as
this
had never happened before, Sasami panicked and fainted."  Ayeka started to
protest, but Yosho held up his hand.
" No, I don't know why she could not be reached, nor why Sunami might leave
at all, but I fear our unseen enemy is stronger than we thought."  Just as
he
finished saying this, they heard a scream from the other room.
" Mihoshi!" They all cried, rushing to her room.
Tenchi got there first and what he saw made him stop in his tracks, causing
Ayeka and Ryoko to bump into him.
Mihoshi looked like she was half gone, like someone was forcing her into
nothing, she saw Tenchi and everyone, and she flailed her arm at them.
" Help me! Let go! Oh Let go!"  she screamed, and before anyone could move
or
say anything, she was gone.

                 ***********************************************************

" Oh no!" gasped Ayeka they were all shocked.
" Where'd she go?" asked Ryoko.
" She Disapeared." Tenchi said.
" But why didn't we hear anyone else when theu disapeared?" Ryoko asked.
Tenchi shrugged.
" Quickly!' Yelled Yosho, starting everyone.  " Investigate the area where
she disapeared.  After a few minutes of searching they all sat down, out of
breath.
" Now what?" asked Ryoko.  No one answered her.  Tenchi looked around the
room.  ow it was just them.  Grandfather, Ryoko, Ayeka, himself, and.....
" Sasami!"  Tenchi suddenly yelled, and he raced back to Sasami's room, only
to find her axactly as she had been.  He breathed a sigh of relief.
Suddenly, his stomache rumbled with hunger.  He glanced behind him at the
others.
" I guess we might as well eat" he said, hoping no one thought him bad to
think of food at a time like this.
" Are you going to cook?" asked Ryoko in a slightly sarcastic tone.
" I believe Sasami left some dinners that just need to be heated up" said
Ayeka.
" I'll go fix them, would you stay here with Sasami, Lord Tenchi?"  Tenchi
knodded, so Ayeka went downstairs.  Everyone else just sat there, silent.



******************************************************************************

***

Now where are those dinners?  Thought Ayeka as she looked through the
fridge.
Out of nowhere, a hand clasped her arms behind her back.
Ayeka screamed, " TENCHIIIIIIIII!" Just as a hand clamped around her mouth.
             ****************************************************
 Tenchi raced down the stairs, afraid of what he might see, Ryoko and
Grandfather were a little farther behind him.
  Tenchi burst into the kitchen and what he saw made him freeze in fear.
Ayeka was looking at him, She appeared  to not be able to talk, but nothing
was around her mouth, and her arms were pinned against her back.
  He ran towards her, Ayeka struggled, finally she managed o free an arm and
her mouth.
" Save me Tenchiiiii"  she cried as she reached out, she, like Mihoshi
appeared to be disapearing into nothing.
" No!" he cried.  He grabbed her hand.
" Don't let go!  oh Tench-" it appeared that she couldn't talk again.
" I won't let go! Fight Ayeka! Fight!"
                      *************************************

Ryoko banged on an invisible barrier.  Why couldn't she get in the kitchen!?
She wanted to help Tenchi, not Ayeka, she was afraid Tenchi would be taken
too.
She shuddered at that thought. No! SHe wouldn't let that happen!  SHe banged
harder, but Tenchi didn't even look at her.  Why?  Tears streamed down her
face.  Why wouldn't he look at her? Why was he helping Ayeka? Why? Why? Why?

                  *****************************************

Ayeka felt her hand slipping.  Whatever was pulling  her was strong.
NO!  She thought, "Help me Tenchi!" but she couldn't speak, the hand was
around her mouth again.  SO she cried silently in her mind, Help me Tenchi,
Help Me.

                    ****************************************

Sweat poured down Tenchi's forehead it seemed like this strange tug-of-war
game had been going on forever.  His hand grew slippery, He couldn't hold on
much longer.  He was tired whatever pulled Ayeka pulled her strongly.
" NOOOOOO!"  H e cried as his hand slipped,,and Ayeka Disapeared form view.
