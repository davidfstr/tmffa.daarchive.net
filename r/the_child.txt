Child

I hope whoever reads this enjoys it as much as I did writing it.  
All characters are owned by Pioneer so don't sue me.  Also Barbie 
is owned by Mattel and Skittles is owned by someone too, but I 
forgot who.  Anyway, please please please don't sue and I'll be 
your best friend! ^_^ Enjoy!


The story begins in the Masaki household.  Sasami and Mihoshi are 
watching t.v.
"This is the coolest show!" Mihoshi giggled.
"I didn't know you liked kid shows," Sasami said.
"They're the best!" Mihoshi exclaimed.
Sasami sweatdropped.  All of a sudden they hear a huge explosion.
"That sounded bad," Mihoshi said.
Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko and Kiyone ran into the living room and 
looked at each other.
"Washu," they all said. 
They hear Washu talking to herself.
"Oh!  It was one cup of nitro glycerin!  Not eleven!"
Everyone face-faults.
"What is trying to do now?" Ayeka said.
"Blow herself up I'd say," Ryoko said.
"I think she succeeded," Kiyone said.
"Shouldn't we check on her?" Tenchi asked.
"No," Ryoko, Ayeka and Kiyone said.
Meanwhile, Mihoshi had been hypnotized by a Barbie commercial.  
"On second thought, we should go to the lab," Ryoko said.
"Sasami, come with us," Ayeka said.
"What about me?" Mihoshi wailed.
"Look Mihoshi!  A Skittles commercial!" Ryoko said.
"Oh goodie!" she squealed.
While Mihoshi stared at the t.v., the others went to the lab.
"What are you doin' in here?" Washu asked.
"What blew up?" Kiyone asked.
"I was in the middle of an important experiment when I added a 
little too much of an ingredient and BOOM!  I was burnt piece of 
bacon," Washu explained.
"What were you trying to destroy this time?" Ryoko asked.
"I wasn't trying to destroy anything!  I was trying to make a 
person kinda like you Ryoko, but not such a selfish brat!"
"BRAT?!?!" Ryoko yelled.
"Why did you need nitro glycerin?" Ayeka asked.
"Personality," Washu said.
"Uh, ok," Ayeka replied.
"Now lets see....where are my samples?  Hmm, I guess I'll have to 
find more," Washu said, looking around.
Everyone backed up.
"What?" she asked innocently.
Just then Mihoshi came in.
"Hey!  I told you to never come in here Bubblehead!" Washu said 
angrily.
"I'm sorry," Mihoshi said, "What are you making?"
"None of your....hang on!  I have an idea!  I could improve on 
Mihoshi!"
"What?" Ryoko asked.
"I could make her smarter!.....No, it would never work," Washu 
said sadly.
Mihoshi looked blank.
"What's going on?" Mihoshi asked.
Everyone face-faulted.
"Nothing," they all said.
"Just....get out of my lab everyone!  I have work to do," Washu 
said.
Everyone started to leave, but before Tenchi could walk out Washu 
closed the door.
"Why did you do that, Washu?" he asked.
"Tenchi, do you think you could help with my invention?" Washu 
asked.
"What do you want me to do?" 
Washu's eyes sparkled.
"I'm not gonna like this am I?" Tenchi asked.
"Most likely not!" Washu said happily.
**************************************************
"Washu!  What is this thing?" Tenchi said.
Washu had put Tenchi, only in his boxers, inside a large tube.
"Don't worry!  This won't hurt a bit!  TeeHee!" Washu giggled.
She flipped a switch and the tube started to glow.  Another tube 
near Tenchi's glowed too.
"Now, with the information I've put in, and the DNA extracted from 
you, Tenchi, we should have a new human being!" Washu said 
happily.
"What kind of information did you put in?" Tenchi asked.
"Mine of course!" said Washu.
"I don't think I like the way things are heading," Tenchi said. 
The tubes stopped glowing and a child stepped out of the other 
tube.  The child had brownish-pink spiky hair and vivid green 
eyes.
"Hello," she said.
"So that's what our kid would look like," Washu said.
"Don't joke!" Tenchi said angrily.
"I am Kaitari," she said.
"I picked that name!" Washu said girlishly.
"I don't like this one bit," Tenchi said.
"Buck up Tenchi!  You're a daddy now!" Washu laughed.
"I AM NOT!" Tenchi yelled.
"Come on Kaitari.  I'll introduce you to everyone," Washu said.
**************************************************
All three had gone upstairs. Tenchi was know fully clothed.
"Miss Washu, may I ask who that is?" Ayeka asked.
"This is Kaitari!  Me and Tenchi created her!" Washu said happily.
"So that's what they call it now, huh?" Kiyone said.
"Just how did you 'create' her?!?" Ryoko asked angrily.
"Same way I made you, Ryoko!" Washu said.
Ryoko grumbled some words not appropriate for young ears.
"Oh and Ryoko, this pretty much makes Kaitari your sister!" Washu 
laughed.
Ryoko stood with her mouth open.
"WHAT?!?  I'm...I'm...." Ryoko started.
"Spoiled is what you are!  I didn't raise you to be so selfish to 
people!" Washu said.
"What do you mean?  You didn't raise me period!" Ryoko said.
"Well we all make our mistakes...or good choices," Washu said 
snidely.
"Hey!  That was rude!" Ryoko said.
"So she is my sister?" Kaitari asked pointing to Ryoko.
"No!  I refuse to claim her as my sister!" Ryoko said.
"How bad can it be, Ryoko?  Me and Sasami are the best of 
friends," Ayeka said.
"So?" Ryoko asked.
"So Ryoko, be nice to your little sister!" Washu said.
"I don't wanna!" Ryoko whined.
"Well....there is one way you don't have to associate with her," 
Washu said with a smirk.
"What?" Ryoko was almost afraid to ask.
"Call me...MOM!" Washu said with her eyes sparkling.
Ryoko went over to the wall and banged her head against it.
"Come on sis I'll show you around," Ryoko said grumpily.
"How did you know that would work Washu?" Sasami asked.
"I didn't.  But either way I liked it!" Washu said happily.
Everyone sweatdropped.
**************************************************
Ryoko and Kaitari were sitting on the deck.
"Thanks for showing me around sister," Kaitari said.
"Do me a favor, girl.  Call me Ryoko, that being my name and all," 
Ryoko said.
"Ok," Kaitari said.
"What do you think of Washu?" Ryoko asked.
"She's mean," Kaitari said.
"Why do you think that?" asked Ryoko.
"She was mean to you," Kaitari said with an evil glare.
"Um, stay out here and I'll get us something to drink," Ryoko 
said.
Ryoko walked inside and went over to Washu.
"Um, Washu, have you noticed anything weird about Kaitari?" Ryoko 
asked.
"What do you mean?  She's related to you isn't she?" Washu 
smirked.
"THAT WASN'T FUNNY!" Ryoko yelled.
"Ya it was," Washu said, but then she noticed that Ryoko was about 
to explode and said, "What do you mean by weird?"
"Well, I was looking at her and her eyes seemed evil or something 
like that." 
"She'll probably become a space pirate too and get in trouble just 
like my Little Ryoko!" 
"Don't call me that," Ryoko said angrily.
"Just take care of her for a while.  And whatever you do, stay OUT 
of trouble!" Washu warned.
"Ok, ok.  Just don't blame me if she kills us all," Ryoko said, 
walking away.
Ryoko went back outside.
"Where are our drinks?" Kaitari asked.
Ryoko sweatdropped.
"Um, we didn't have anything good, so we're waiting for dinner!" 
Ryoko lied.
Kaitari gave her a cold stare.
"Hey Kaitari!  Wanna play a game with me?" Sasami asked as she ran 
outside.
"Sure.  What are we gonna play?" Kaitari asked.
"Um, well, let's go over to the garden and we'll figure it out," 
Sasami said.
Sasami grabbed Kaitari's arm and they ran over to the garden.  
Ryoko looked inside and Washu smiled and winked at her.
**************************************************
Tenchi was sitting alone in his room.
"Tenchi?"
Tenchi whirled around to find Washu.
"What do you want from me now Washu?" Tenchi said angrily, but 
then he softened up when he saw Washu's expression.
"What's wrong Washu?" he asked.
"I'm worried about Kaitari.  I've been talking with Ryoko and she 
tells me that Kaitari has an evil streak in her," Washu said 
grimly.
"Evil?  How can she tell?  Are you sure Ryoko is making this up?" 
Tenchi asked.
"Well I made Ryoko and see how she turned out?  Kaitari seems to 
be that way too."
"What do you think Kaitari has in mind?  She should obey you.  You 
made her," Tenchi said.
"I made Ryoko too and look at her!"
Tenchi thinks of all the times Ryoko has chased him, hugged him, 
and blown up the house because of him.
"We're in trouble," he said.
"The world isn't big enough for two Ryokos," Washu said.
"This house isn't big enough for one!" Tenchi laughed.
Washu just stood there.
"If it makes you feel any better, I'll talk to Kaitari," Tenchi 
said.
"Ok.  Thank you Tenchi," Washu replied.
She gave Tenchi a hug.
**************************************************
"No Ayeka!  That's wrong!" Sasami yelled at her sister.
Ayeka was attempting to make dinner and it wasn't turning out too 
well.
"Ryoko!  Stop drinking the tea and help me!" Ayeka shouted.
"Why not let Sasami do it?" Ryoko asked.
"Because me and Kaitari are gonna play some more!  We just stopped 
by to laugh at Ayeka!" Sasami giggled.
"Sasami!  That is very rude! I....eek!" Ayeka screeched as she saw 
the pot of rice boiling over, "I could use your help Ryoko!"
"Ok, ok.  But you need a lot more help than I can give," Ryoko 
said.
"Need us to help?" Mihoshi asked.
"I can be of some help at any rate," Kiyone said.
"How much can it hurt?" Ryoko asked.
Big mistake.
"Mihoshi!  Watch it!  Get the pot off the burner before it 
spills," Kiyone yelled.
"Ok," Mihoshi said.
As she grabbed the pot, she realized something.
"IT'S REALLY HOT!!! she screamed and threw the pot, which in turn, 
landed on Ayeka's foot.
"OWIE!" Ayeka squealed.
Ayeka hopped around a bit and bumped into Ryoko, knocking her 
down.  As Ryoko fell she grabbed for something to keep her up.  
Unfortunately, she grabbed Kiyone's shirt dragging her down as 
well.  Kaitari and Sasami busted out laughing.
"You look like a bunch of confused monkeys!" Kaitari laughed.
"That's so true!" Sasami agreed.
"SASAMI!!!!" Ayeka yelled.
"Oops," Sasami said, "C'mon Kaitari.  Let's go back outside." 
"Ok," Kaitari replied.
The girls ran to go outside, but Tenchi stopped them.  
"Sasami, can you leave us alone for a minute?" Tenchi asked.
"Ok Tenchi.  Ryoohki!  Let's go outside!  I'll wait by the gates 
for you, Kaitari," Sasami said.
"Meow?" Ryoohki asked.
"Come on!" Sasami said playfully.
Ryoohki jumped on Sasami's shoulders and they ran outside.
Kaitari looked after her and gave Tenchi a cold stare.
"What do you want?" she asked him.
"I've been told you have, how should I put this, a mean streak?  
I've also heard you think poorly of Washu," Tenchi said.
"So?  I only like Ryoko and Sasami.  I simply cannot stand the 
others, including you," Kaitari said coldly.
"But Kaitari..."
Her eyes flashed.
"I do not think this is the time to discuss such matters!" she 
said evily.
Washu watched in horror from the doorway as Kaitari lifted Tenchi 
in the air with some unknown power and flung him across the room.
"Stop it Kaitari!" Washu yelled.
Kaitari spun around and stared at Washu.  By now the other girls 
had regained their composure and were also watching.
"I will take over this measly planet starting with this house!  I 
know Ryoko has powers that can help me, and Sasami can summon 
Tsunami to help me.  I have no need for you or anyone else!" 
Kaitari said defiantly.
"How dare you! You little brat!  Washu created you and this is how 
you treat her?!?" Ryoko fumed.
"So Ryoko, you're turning against me, are you?  I thought I could 
trust you, but I guess I was wrong.  You must also be disposed 
of."
A blue forcefield materialized around Kaitari and her eyes glowed 
red.
"Hurry!  Into my lab!" Washu yelled.
Everyone ran in.  Ryoko stopped short when she saw Washu run back.
"What are you doing Washu?" Ryoko asked.
"Tenchi is still out there!" Washu replied.
"I almost forgot!" Ryoko gasped.
They both ran back and grabbed Tenchi from the ground.  They 
hurried back to the lab before anything could happen.
**************************************************
"Oh no!  Sasami is still out there!" Ayeka realized.
"Don't worry.  Kaitari likes Sasami.  She wouldn't hurt her," 
Kiyone said.
"Don't bet on that one," Washu said.
"I know!  We can send Mihoshi out there to get Sasami!" Ryoko 
said.
Mihoshi looked at everyone's faces.
"I DON'T WANNA!" Mihoshi cried.
"Girls girls girls!  Calm down!  We can get through this!" Tenchi 
said.
Everyone stared at him for a moment then they diverted their 
attention back to sending out Mihoshi.  Tenchi sighed.
"No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no," Mihoshi whined.
"Get over it Mihoshi!  You're a Galaxy Police Detective!  It's 
your duty!" Kiyone said.
"You come too," Mihoshi said crying.
"I, um, have to stay here," Kiyone said.
"Oh," Mihoshi replied, "but what if I don't come back?"
"We party," Washu said to herself.
Ryoko gave her a high five.
"What was that?" Mihoshi said.
"She said we'll cry," Ryoko said.
"Ok.  So I go get Sasami and come back here?" Mihoshi said.
"YES!" they all said.
So they sent Mihoshi outside.  Before they get the door closed, 
Mihoshi ran back in.
"No Mihoshi!  You're supposed to stay outside!" Kiyone said 
angrily.
"I CAN'T DO IT!" Mihoshi wailed.
"Well we'll go to plan 'B'," Washu said.
Everyone face-faulted.
"YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME THERE WAS A PLAN 'B'?!?!?! everyone 
yelled.
Washu sweatdropped.
"Um, ya?" Washu said sheepishly.
"Miss Washu!  I suggest you tell us all what your plan is 
immediately!" Ayeka said very angrily.
"Well none of you even gave me a chance to tell you!  Anyway, very 
much unlike Ryoko, Kaitari's life force relies on a small blue 
crystal that hangs around her neck.  If we can get that crystal 
from her and destroy it, she will disappear.  Unfortunately it 
will kill her," Washu explained.
"Well who cares?  Kill her before she kills us I say!" Ryoko said.
"Tenchi?  Is that okay with you?" Washu asked.
"Why do you need my permission.  You seem to do what you want 
anyway," Tenchi said.
"Well Kaitari is partly your child!  Do you want to destroy her?" 
Washu asked.
Ryoko didn't like the idea of Kaitari being partly Tenchi's child.
"I didn't think of it that way, but she can't be allowed to remain 
here!" Tenchi said boldly.
"Ok.  I'm asking all of you to be brave.  We must go upstairs.  
Perhaps if we find Sasami, she can help.  Once the crystal is 
taken, it must be returned to my lab.  Whoever gets the crystal, 
go to my lab immediately!" Washu explained.
Everyone went to the door and looked out.  No sign of Kaitari 
anywhere.
"Ready?" Ayeka asked.
"Go!" Kiyone yelled.
Everyone scattered around the house looking for Kaitari.
**************************************************
"Finally!" Sasami said as she saw Kaitari approaching.
"Well, Tenchi talked too much!" Kaitari replied with a laugh.
"So what do you wanna do?" Sasami asked, "It's kinda boring here, 
huh?"
"Well, we could play hide and seek.  You and Ryoohki hide and I'll 
seek!" Kaitari suggested. 
As Kaitari turned to count, the sun caught the crystal around her 
neck.
"Oh!  What a pretty charm!  Is it a real crystal?" Sasami asked.
Kaitari looked down at her necklace.
"Oh.  Yes, it's real, but now go hide so I can find you!" Kaitari 
said.
"Ok.  I like your necklace," Sasami said as she went to go find a 
place to hide.
As soon as Sasami had left, Kaitari turned around.
*So she hasn't caught on to my plan yet, has she?* Kaitari 
thought, *Well I'll show her.  I'll show everyone!*
Kaitari turned toward the house and started walking.
**************************************************
*I need to find Sasami,* Ayeka thought, *She could be the key to 
all this.*
"Ayeka!  Any luck?" Ryoko asked as she hovered nearby.
"What are you doing here, Ryoko?  You're supposed to be looking 
upstairs, not outside!" Ayeka said furiously.
"Excuse me Princess!  I just wanted to help!" Ryoko snapped back.
"I'm sorry.  It's just I'm worried about Sasami hanging out with 
that evil girl," Ayeka said apologetically.
"Well, they did go outside didn't they?  They must be around 
here....Look Ayeka!" 
"What?  What do you see Ryoko?" Ayeka asked.
"It's Sasami and Ryoohki!" Ryoko said.
"Hey!  I'm supposed to be hiding!  You guys ruined it!" Sasami 
said.
"Sasami!  I'm so glad you're all right," Ayeka said, hugging her 
sister.
"Ayeka!  What's wrong with you?" Sasami asked.
" Kaitari isn't the best friend you'll ever have, Sasami.  She's 
evil!" Ryoko said.
"No!  She isn't evil! I know she isn't!" Sasami protested.
"Sasami, please listen...." Ayeka began.
She couldn't finish because she was cut off by an ear-piercing 
scream from the house.  The three looked at each other before 
running to the house.
**************************************************
"Don't hurt me!" Mihoshi wailed.
Kaitari just stared at her.
"I DON'T WANNA DIE! NO NO NO! WAHHHHH!!!" Mihoshi cried.
Jets of water poured out of her eyes.
"I don't think she's worth attacking," Kaitari said.
Mihoshi was crying even more.
"Stop or you're under arrest!" Kiyone said.
She was in her Galaxy Police uniform with her trusty gun in her 
hand.
Mihoshi continued crying.
"Mihoshi!  You're supposed to help!" Kiyone said irritably.
"SHE'S GONNA KILL US ALL!  WAHHHHHHHHH," Mihoshi wailed.
"So you think you're gonna shoot me?" Kaitari asked cooly.
"Get her crystal!" Washu said, running in from the front door.
Tenchi ran in from the back of the house and Ayeka, Ryoko, and 
Sasami ran in from the backyard.
"No one will be able to destroy me," Kaitari said.
"What did you make her from Washu, spices?  She's got a nasty 
attitude," Ryoko said.
"She must take after her sister," Washu replied.
Ryoko got angry and turned red.
"Don't hurt them, Kaitari," Sasami said.
"I won't hurt you Sasami.  You're my friend.  You're the only one 
who hasn't been mean to me," Kaitari said.
Sasami walked over to Kaitari.  Sasami held out her hand.
"Friends?" she asked.
Kaitari looked at her for a second.
"What is she doing?  You don't make friends with the enemy!" Ryoko 
hissed.
"Shh!  Be quiet Ryoko!" Ayeka hissed back.
Mihoshi had finally stopped crying and was sniffling.  Kaitari 
held out her hand too.
"Ok.  Friends," she said.
But Sasami didn't shake her hand.  She grabbed the necklace that 
hung around Kaitari's neck.
"Like that Ayeka?" Sasami asked.
"Yes!  Hurry Sasami!  Go to Washu's lab!" Ayeka yelled.
Sasami ran to go to the lab.
"STOP!" Kaitari yelled, "No!  Don't do it Sasami!" 
"Everyone into my lab!" Washu yelled.
They all ran, but Kaitari still possessed powers.  As Sasami went 
to open the door, Kaitari used her powers to shut it.
"Oh no!" Sasami shrieked.
"What are we gonna do?" Kiyone asked.
"WE'RE GONNA DIE!" Mihoshi cried.
"Shut her up already!" Ryoko yelled.
"Now, give me the crystal and no one gets hurt," Kaitari said. 
She slowly advanced towards the lab.
"Don't give it to her Sasami" Ayeka said.
"We have to destroy it!" Washu reminded her.
Kaitari was about to attack someone when Ryoohki jumped on her arm 
and bit her, making her lose her concentration.
"OUCH!  YOU LITTLE PEST!" she yelled.
"Good job Ryoohki!" Sasami said as she flung the lab door open.
They all ran in, including Ryoohki.
"Now lemme see the crystal.  Hurry!" Washu said.
Sasami handed her the crystal.
"How do you destroy it?" Tenchi asked.
"Watch," Washu said.
Washu typed on her translucent keyboard and a small box appeared.  
She put the crystal inside it and closed the lid.
"Here Tenchi," She said, "hold this."
She thrust the box into Tenchi's hands and again typed on the 
keyboard.
"LET ME IN!" Kaitari called from the door.
"Hurry Miss Washu!" Tenchi said.
"I'm trying!" she replied.
She typed one final key just as the door flew open.  They all 
watched in horror as the girl melted away.
"That...that....that..." was all Ayeka could say.
Mihoshi cried some more.
"What now Mihoshi?" Kiyone asked.
"That was icky!" Mihoshi replied.
Tenchi opened the box and there was fine blue powder inside.  He 
looked over at Washu.
"The commands I gave the box crushed the crystal into powder.  We 
don't have to worry about her anymore!" Washu said with a smile.
"Let's go back to the living room," Tenchi suggested.
So they all went to relax.
**************************************************
"Miss Washu..." Ayeka began.
"Call me 'Little Washu'!" Washu said with a gleam in her eye.
"Ok, Little Washu, don't ever try to make another person like 
that!" Ayeka said.
"All right," Washu said.  
Washu glanced at Tenchi.
"But next time it'll be for real!" she giggled.
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!?!" Ryoko said furiously.
"Just what I said!  TeeHee!" Washu giggled again.
She gave Tenchi another glance.
"Um, well, I," Tenchi stammered.
"TENCHI IS MINE!!!" Ryoko yelled.
"Excuse me, but I belive Lord Tenchi is mine!" Ayeka growled.
"Here we go again," Mihoshi said.
"He's MINE!" Ryoko yelled.
"No MINE!" Ayeka shouted.
"MINE!"
"MINE!"
Everyone started laughing at the two of them as they continued 
fighting.
**************************************************

Epilogue

The seven of them continued a happy life there for two more years.  
Mihoshi and Kiyone were called back to Galaxy police, where they 
were promoted.  Ayeka and Sasami went home to Jurai.  Ayeka 
married a young prince from another planet and they eloped to his 
planet.  Sasami took over as crown Princess of Jurai.  Tenchi 
finally proposed.  Much to Ryoko's dislike, he proposed to Washu, 
who in turn, said yes.  They also went back to Jurai, where he and 
Washu took the throne as King and Queen. They had one daughter 
with brownish-pink hair and green eyes.  They named her Kaitari.  
She turned out to be a very loving person, and loved her parents 
deeply. Ryoko went back to being a Space pirate, but she forever 
longed to see Tenchi again.  She never did.

The End
