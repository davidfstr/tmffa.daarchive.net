	I do not own any of these characters, except for Ryo, whom I made 
up. (I did borrow Ryoko's nickname, I did not create that part, but her 
personality is my mine.) I do not intend on making a profit off of 
this, etc. In the parenthesis is the name of the point of view.  When 
the point of view is changed, then the name in () will change.

(Kagato)
"There she is.  My beautiful creation.  What!  Where's Yuzahami?"  
She was the perfect demon.  How could they have destroyed her?  I had 
felt her presence and followed it, but now it's gone.  It must be the 
work of that boy.  He'll be terrified if he sees the resurrected 
Kagato.
(Ryoko)
	"Ryoko, there's someone on the phone for you," cried Tenchi.  It 
was nice to live in a house with no Ayeka.  But it seemed empty without 
everyone else.
	"I'm coming!"  I got off the couch and ran to the phone.  Tenchi 
hung up when he heard me pick up the one in the kitchen.  "Hello?  Miss 
Ryoko Masaki speaking."  Ha!  I wish.
	"How are you doing Ryoko?  It's been such a long time since we've 
talked to each other."  I dropped the phone in horror.
(Tenchi)
	I heard something crash. I ran to the kitchen to see what 
happened. Ryoko looked at me and laughed. "Clumsy me. I dropped the 
phone."
	"Okay. Well I'll be out in the garden if you want me."
	"Bye, Tenchi." That was odd. Since when is Ryoko clumsy? Oh, 
well. I better hurry if I want to get done by the time supper is ready. 
(Which is normally rice and saki ordered from the nearest fast-food 
restaurant. 
(Ryoko)
	"What do you want?"
	"To see you again, Ryoko."
	"Quit with the crap.  I know you're up to something."
	"Oh, really?  How could you tell?"
	"I know you too well, Kagato.  Now tell me what you're up to."
	"Aren't you wondering how I'm still alive?"
	"I don't really care."
	"You will soon."  And then he hung up.  What does that mean?
(Kagato)
	It's too bad.  Ryoko is, or should I say was, a beautiful demon.  
Now I'll have to temporarily disable her.  I don't want her getting 
into the wrong hands.  That would be costly.  
(Tenchi)
	"So who was it, Ryoko?"
	"Some sales person. Nothing special."
	"You looked a little startled at first."
	"Why would I be frightened? It's not like anyone can do anything 
to me. I still have all my power from before." I could see worry in her 
face. What could be so terrible to make Ryoko worry?
	"I thought Lefina took back her power."	
	"It was originally in my body, so I get to keep it since she's 
using it."
	"Huh?"
	"She kept my original body so she could remain solid. Therefore, 
since she gave me a body for my spirit, it took part of my body to make 
it. That's why I share her power."
	"I get it now." Uh, not really. But why have her go on and on 
about something I don't get? Suddenly Ryoko's face fell in her soup. 
"Ryoko? Are you okay? Ryoko?" I picked her head up and it was covered 
with rice. 
	What had happened? She is still breathing. Her heartbeat seems 
normal. She couldn't have fallen asleep, or could she? I slapped her 
face to make sure. Nope. Not asleep.
	"Shut down completed," she murmured. What the heck? What does 
that mean? I picked her up and put her on the couch. Now what?
(Kagato)
	Let's have some fun. Tenchi.  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  I'll 
just control my puppet until I arrive to reclaim her.
(Tenchi)
	Ryoko opened her eyes, yet she looked still asleep. "Ryoko?"
	"Yes, Tenchi?" Her eyes were blank looking. "Well? What do you 
want?"
	"Are you okay?"
	"I'm perfectly fine. In fact, I'm more than fine. Come here, 
Tenchi." Oh, no. What's wrong with her now? She walked over towards me 
and ran her index finger down my shirt.
	"What are you doing?"
	"Trying to seduce you." Ryoko normally did that, but she never 
admitted to it. Something's definitely wrong. "What's wrong, Tenchi? 
You look a little shocked." What should I say?
	"Uh, well, I, um."
	"Is it because I'm such a beautiful demon, or is it because you 
don't like me. You probably think I'm ugly. Yes, you probably do. 
You've hurt my feelings, calling me an ugly demon!"
	"I never said that at all!"
	"Now you're lying to me, Tenchi! And yelling! I don't think this 
relationship is going anywhere!"
	"What relationship?" Her eyes lit up. I shouldn't have said that.
	"What do you mean what relationship? Am I not good enough for 
you? I should think so since I'm carrying your child!" What is she 
talking about?
	"But you're still a virgin." I think.
	"Now you pretend like it never happened! I hate you! Leaving me 
to raise our child, it's not morally right!" Huh? She drew out her 
sword. I know what that means! I turned around and started to run, you 
would too, if an angry demon was shooting energy beams at you. "At 
least I'll be able to say my husband's dead instead of that he ran off 
with a slut of a princess!" WHAT?
(Kagato)
	Soja arrived at the small planet.  I'm sure that boy's enjoying 
Ryoko's mind games.  I released my control over her.  I should be 
arriving soon anyway.
(Ryoko)
	"Hi, Tenchi, darling."  He looked as if he'd seen a ghost.
	"Stay away from me, you, you creature!" What does he mean?
	"What's wrong?"
	"Like you don't know.  Just leave, now!" 
	"You don't mean that, do you?"
	"Get out of my house!"  What?  How can he be mad at me?  
	"It won't be necessary, Ryoko."  It can't be!  Kagato walked 
towards me and ran his hand through my hair.  "Well, Tenchi, did you 
like her?"
	"What?"
	"Her little mind game.  I'm sure she did."
	"Were you doing that, Ryoko?"
	"Of course she was."  I tried to speak, but I couldn't.  "She's a 
little tongue-tied right now.  We'll see you later.  We have a trip to 
take."  What trip?
(Kagato)
	Soja transported us to its lab.  Ryoko was locked into capsule I 
had prepared for her earlier.  "Get me out of here!"
	"Why?  It would wreck everything."  She looked very angry.  Let 
her be, like it matters at all.  "How do you like the idea of being 
cloned?"
	"Not at all.  You can't replicate me."
	"That's where you're wrong.  I can make a copy of your body and 
power, but it would not be solid.  It could still be extremely useful."
	"For what?"
	"It's none of our business.  You wouldn't be able to witness my 
plan in action anyway."
	"What do you mean by that?"
	"You'll be unconscious."
(Tenchi)
	Where did they go? Why should I care, since Ryoko's crazy and 
Kagato wants to kill me. Kagato wants to kill me! I just hope that he 
doesn't anytime soon. 
	But why would Ryoko do the things she did? She normally doesn't 
act like that. So what if Kagato controls.that's it! He wanted me to 
get mad at her so that I wouldn't want her back. I would never do that, 
though. Yet I already have risked her life by letting her go.

(Kagato)
	"How would you like to see your old home?"
	"What old home?"
	"The one you were trapped in for 700 years."  Horror filled her 
eyes.
	"No!  Please don't!  I beg you, anything but there!"
	"Well too bad, because that's where we're going."
(Ryoko)
	We appeared in front of the cave.  I kicked and screamed, but I 
couldn't fight him.  Kagato dragged me to the entrance by my hand.  We 
walked through its dark passageway and to the main shrine.  "Doesn't 
this bring back memories?"  Yeah, bad ones.  Terrible, terrible ones.  
We slid down the narrow slope to the chamber.
	It was right in front of me.  The crypt that had held me hostage 
for all those years.  I grabbed onto Kagato to get his attention.  
"Please, I'll do anything, just don't put me in there!"
	"Poor Ryoko.  I just feel so bad to lock up so a beautiful, 
enchanting demon."  What is he getting at?  
	"What do you mean?"  He took my arms and pushed me away from him.
	"But I guess it won't matter, since I'll have a clone of you!"  
No!  He pushed me into the small pool, which pulled me into it like 
quicksand.
	"Tenchi!  No!"  I was held down below the surface by the same 
power that kept me here all those years.  Kagato had a vicious look on 
his face as he walked away.  Don't leave me here!  The wall closed up, 
leaving no entrance or exit to the room.
	Something entered my mind.  "He doesn't like, he never has he 
never will."  That's not true!  "Tenchi loves Sakuya, even you know 
that.  You always have."  No, he loves me now!  "Ayeka is more powerful 
and prettier than you.  Tenchi even likes her more than you."  No!  I 
won't except that!  It's all lies!  All of it!  I can't believe it!  I 
won't!
	I opened my eyes.  I was in a weird field.  Tenchi was there, but 
with Ayeka.  "What are you doing here?"
	"We're on our honeymoon, Ryoko.  Tenchi finally decided to marry 
me," Ayeka answered.  What?
	"And once we get back, we can start our own family."  Yeah, 
right.  But wait.  Why did Tenchi look at her like that?  How could he 
sit by her that close without.no.  No!  It's not real!  
	It all disappeared.  "Why do you keep on denying it, Ryoko.  You 
know I'm the only that appreciates you for what you are."  That was 
Kagato's voice. 
	"Then why did you lock me up?"
	"To protect you from that boy.  You saw how he reacted to you.  
He wanted you to leave.  You saw that seriousness in his eyes."  I did.  
But why?  "Only I understand you.  Just trust me."
(Kagato)
	It worked perfectly.  An exact clone of Ryoko stood in front of 
me.  "Hello, Ryo."
	"Hello, Kagato."  I had switched some genes around, of course, to 
make her all mine.  She won't disobey me like Ryoko does.  She even 
looks better than Ryoko.  That dress I gave her fits perfectly.  It 
gives her that evil look.  Perfect.  
(Ryo)
	I opened my eyes to see Kagato.  "How are you feeling?"
	"I little dizzy, but that's all."
	"Good.  That means you were cloned perfectly.  Your gems are even 
real."  I looked down at my wrists.  Yep, the round jewels attached to 
my dress were real.  "Do you know what to do?"
	"I'm pretty sure.  I can make up parts if I forget.  You don't 
have to worry, I will take care of everything."  He smiled.  That 
weakling Ryoko.  How could she fall for such a puny mortal?
	I teleported to her cave.  There she was, a hideous mummy 
skeleton.  I'm glad I'm not like her.  She seemed alive, yet she looked 
dead.  Whatever is happening to her, I'm happy I'm not experiencing it.
	I faded out and back in at the Masaki house.  "Hello?"  Tenchi is 
home.  I faded so he couldn't see me.  "Is anybody there?"  Like I 
would tell him.  I watched him as he sat back down on his couch.  He 
put his head between his hands, and started mumbling.  He's not very 
bright.  Who would talk to themselves? 
	"How could I have let her go?  I should have known Kagato was up 
no good.  Heck, he's dead.  How could he do anything good if he's dead?  
Yet he looked different.  Somehow younger and more handsome." 
	"Hello, Tenchi."  He jumped in shock.
	"How.what are you doing here, Ryoko?"
	"My name is Ryo, I'm glad that I'm not that sad excuse for a 
demon."  He looked confused.  "You'll understand."  I ran over towards 
him and, by hooking my arms under his from behind, lifted him off the 
ground, teleported to Soja.
(Tenchi)
	"Hello Tenchi. I believe we have met many times before." Ryo? 
Where is Ryoko, then? Ryo doesn't look exactly like Ryoko, but still. 
"She's called a clone." She appeared by Kagato. 
	"What have you done with Ryoko?"
	"Well I cloned her, but I guess you are blind."
	"Besides that!"
	"She is a remarkable demon, but unfortunately she has eyes for 
only you. That's why I made an exact clone of her, only with a 
different memory. She is loyal to me, unlike Ryoko."
	"I look better than her, anyway," added Ryo. Sure, that's what 
she . wow! She does! How did he change her if she's a clone? Oh, well. 
That doesn't matter right now.
	"You didn't answer me."
	"I'm not going to. It's none of your business."
	"Yes it is."
	"Oh, really? How?"
	"Because she's my.because."
	"You don't even know. I won't waste my time with you, sill boy. 
Take care of him, Ryo."
	"Of course. This will be fun!"
 	Maybe for her. She formed the same long sword that Ryoko uses. 
(Ryo)
	"Now just hold still.  I won't hurt you."  Yeah, right.  That's 
all I intend to do.  Kagato disappeared to go do something.  I leaped 
down to the floor.  "Do you want to die quickly or slowly?  It's your 
choice."
	"How about we talk this over?  You don't want to kill me."
	"That's where you're wrong.  Ryoko won't be a silly weakling with 
you gone."  I started running towards him, but he ran in the other 
direction.  "Why are you making this difficult?"  I aimed and threw my 
sword at him.  I missed!  I went through the bottom of his pant leg and 
anchored him to the floor.
	"I've got you now."  I walked over to him as he tripped and fell 
to the ground.  He turned his head to look at me and I saw pure fear on 
his face.  Like that will stop me.  Something flashed before my eyes.  
Everything started turning black and gray.  It faded in and out.  A 
terrible screaming entered my mind.  It was loud and piercing.
(Ryoko)
	"Stop it!  No!  Go away!"  A dark creature in the depths of my 
tomb caused this terrible pain in my mind.  It was screeching like a 
banshee.  Its eyes glowed bright red, but I couldn't make out the rest 
of its shape.  Something dark wrapped around me, paralyzing my body.  
The monster lurked closer.  I could make out its details.  Its form 
wavered back and forth, and it was made of a wispy matter that seemed 
to swallow up all light.  It screamed like a drill as it got closer to 
me.
(Ryo)
	"What's happening?"  Everything was dark and cloudy.  The noise 
got even louder.  It's sound felt like it was penetrating my mind.  
"Make it stop!  I can't stand it!"  I fell over.  Something felt like 
it was pushing down on me.
(Ryoko)
	The thing was an inch in front of my face.  "I can see the power 
within you."  How did it speak?  I heard the sound, yet it had no 
mouth.  "You cannot use it, though.  You do not except it."
	"What are you talking about?"  Its narrow eyes squinted.
	"You do not want to except that you are an evil demon, that you 
were made to destroy galaxies.  You don't want to be your true form."  
What is that thing talking about?  "I will have to force you to turn to 
your true form."  What?  
	It surrounded me with its essence.  Suddenly it felt like 
something was compressing me, forcing me to squeeze.
(Ryo)
	Claws that never existed pierced my dress, shredding it into 
pieces.  Then they dug into my skin and ripped down.  I tried to run 
away from it all, but stakes pounded through my hands and feet, nailing 
me to the wall.
(Tenchi)
	Ryo was being held against the wall by some invisible force. Her 
hands and feet had giant holes in them. She screamed out of extreme 
pain. What is happening? 
(Ryoko)
	My head felt like it was crushing in.  Then a cloudy looking 
figure came out of nowhere.  It had huge fangs and claws, and its eyes 
were exactly like the previous monster.  "Show your true self!"
	"I don't know what you're talking about."
	"Show it!"  I felt really dizzy.  Getting no answer it went into 
a terrible rage.  I came at me, slicing my arms and forehead.  Then it 
raised its arm and whipped it around at me.
(Tecnhi)
	Blood dripped down from Ryo's forehead, arms, legs, and body. Her 
eyes were full of pain and terror. Then she closed her eyes tight as 
something ripped at her side.
(Ryoko)
	The pain was unbearable.  "Show yourself."  I couldn't answer 
since I couldn't breath.  I choked but I couldn't get any oxygen.  The 
phantom took its longest and sharpest claw.
(Ryo)
	I can't breathe.  What is that?  There's something flying towards 
me!  Oh, no!
(Tenchi)
	A knife flew out of nothingness and.I can't look. It went through 
Ryo's neck. Her jaw dropped as a final gasp came out of her mouth.
	Something in my mind flashed. That's Ryoko. What happened to her? 
Then a spirit, actually more of a demon, appeared and went into Ryo. A 
bunch of energy shot out and surrounded her in a ring. Light came out 
of her fingertips and her eyes shined brightly.
	It all disappeared, even the invisible stakes. Ryo fell to the 
ground. 
(Ryoko)
	Nothing.  There is nothing.  I am not real.  I'm just.just a, a 
demon.  No space pirate, no past, no present, no future.  Just.nothing.  
(Ryo)
	The pain.  It's too unbearable!  I can't go through it.  
Something picked me up gently.  I opened my eyes, though everything was 
too blurry to make anything out.  "Ryo?"  I squinted to try to see who 
it was.  "It's Tenchi.  I'll try to bandage your wounds but." He 
actually wants to save me.
	"Don't bother.  I'm going to die anyway."
	"I won't let you die.  You're too much like."
	"Ryoko?  But I'm not like her at all."
	"I don't want to lose either of you. You both are needed 
somewhere."
	"Oh, Tenchi.  You're so optimistic.  I have no one to live for, 
and nobody even cares if I die."
	"I do."  
	"Now I see why Ryoko loves you."  Everything went black.

(Tenchi)
	Ryo had passed out. She could be losing blood and heat quickly. I 
took my over-shirt and put it on her. How can I get any help here? 
(Kagato)
	Something happened to Ryo.  I went to my great hall.  That boy 
was holding her.  What?!  She was bleeding all over.  "What have you 
done to her?"  He looked over at me, shocked.
	"I didn't do anything!  Some invisible ghost creature attacked 
her."  That means.Ryoko and Ryo are still connected.  I walked over and 
picked her up, leaving Tenchi behind as we went into my lab.
(Ryo)
	"Open your eyes, Ryo."  Who is that?  I looked around.  I was 
floating in some odd container.  What is that pain in my head?  My 
neck, hands, and feet were all bandaged.  What had happened to me?  "I 
know that you're in there."  Something inside me stirred.
	"And what are you going to do about it?"  Who said that?  The man 
standing outside the container looked at me.  Did I say that?
	"Let her be, spirit."  Huh?
	"What are you talking about?"
	"Oh, Ryo, your awake.  You were possessed by an evil demon during 
your last fight.  Don't you remember?"
	"I can't remember anything."
	"I can solve that."
	"No!  I do remember something.a boy named.Tenchi."  His face 
grimaced.  "He was kind to me, and helped me somehow."  He walked out 
of the room.
(Ryoko)
	I have only one purpose, and that is to.to destroy.  Destroy 
anything, and everything, and whatever I am commanded to do.
(Tenchi)
What had happened to Ryo? And where did Kagato take her? "How 
dare you! You ruined everything!"  A sword came down a couple inches 
from my left shoulder. "You little rat!"
A quickly turned around to face Kagato. His eyes were full of 
hatred. He raised his other arm and shot out a blast of energy that 
knocked me down. He walked towards me and held the tip of his sword to 
my neck. "What did I do?"
"What did you do! You destroyed all of my plans! I wanted to 
control Ryoko but she wouldn't let me because of you! And now you did 
something to Ryo! The only way I will get control is if I kill you!" 
That's not good. I couldn't move because if I did Kagato would probably 
kill me.
"Leave him alone!" A sword shot out of nowhere and hit the ground 
by Kagato.
"Stay out of this, Ryo!" yelled Kagato. So she is okay. I started 
to scoot back away from his sword. "Go back to the lab!"
"No! I won't let you harm Tenchi." She shot out another sword.
(Ryo)
Nobody will hurt Tenchi.  Not a single soul.  I will die 
protecting him.  But why do I feel this way?  I never liked him before.  
I started to like him when.
(Ryoko)
I can't remember my own past.  It's all gone.  All the memories, 
who I knew.  Just.gone.  "Ryoko."  Who was that?  "Ryoko, you should 
recognize my presence.  We share powers."  That doesn't help meat all.  
"I see.  You lost half of your soul to Ryo.  That's why you can't 
remember anything.  I'll give it back to you."
(Tenchi)
Ryo fell to the floor. What keeps on happening to her? Kagato 
picked her up and disappeared. I got to get out of here. I searched the 
walls for a hidden door. Nothing. I'm trapped.
(Ryoko)
Lefina.  "See.  I knew you would recognize me."
"Why are you here?"
"Tenchi and Ryo need your help."
"Wait.  Who's Ryo?"  It feels like I'm talking to air.
"She's your clone, and now she has an evil force inside her.  She 
will destroy Tenchi and you if she gets a chance."
"What force?"
"The same as the monster that attacked you.  It stole half of 
your soul and gave it to her so it could control her eventually.  But 
without part of your soul she will follow Kagato's orders and destroy 
Tenchi anyway."
"And how am I supposed to help?"
"You will have to leave your body and join Ryo.  It's the only 
way to protect her."
(Ryo)
"Destroy Tenchi.  He's your enemy.  Find Ryoko and destroy her.  
She will get you if you don't.  Kill Kagato.  He will control you 
forever if you don't."  I opened my eyes.  Nobody was there.  I was 
stuck in the same cage again.
"Hello?"  Something in front of my face glowed red.  "What are 
you?"
"I am your new friend.  Or I could be your enemy if you don't do 
as I say."
"I will never hurt Tenchi."  I could never hurt Tenchi.  I love 
him. I would never.
"Then I will make you do it."
(Ryoko)
"How can this be?"  Ryo is almost exactly like me.
"She is your clone, so therefore she can share your mind, 
feelings, looks, and part of your power.  But she cannot be complete 
without a soul.  She loves Tenchi just as much as you do."  Her.love 
Tenchi?  "And Tenchi knows that she is different, yet he thinks that 
you two are alike." 
"But we are not.  Just as Zero was different than I.  By the way, 
whatever happened to her?"
"She is part of you still.  That is why you love Tenchi as much 
as you do."  I watched Tenchi sit on the stone floor, and I could see 
the pain in his eyes.  I went out to touch him but it was as if glass 
separated us.  
"He misses her, doesn't he?"
"I'm afraid so."  How can.Tenchi likes my own clone.  A tear fell 
onto my cheek.  
"Is there anyway I can reach him."
"No."  I'm stuck over here, just inches away from him, but I 
can't join him.  It is torture to see him without being able to help.  
"There is a way part of you can join the other side."
"How?"
"Let Zero free."
"But wouldn't it." Wouldn't that change my mind and feelings?
"You won't love Tenchi, but at least part of you could be with 
him."  All alone again.  I will lose yet again another part of me.  But 
if it would help Tenchi.
"Send her to him."
"Are you sure?  You will never be able to join again."  What?  
Never love.or even truly like.Tenchi?  I pounded on the glass as I 
started to cry even harder.  It's not fair!
"I know it's not fair, Ryoko.  But it's the right thing to do."  
My Tenchi.he will no longer be mine.
"Just get it over quickly."  I could feel part of me drifting 
away.  "Goodbye, my Tenchi!  My only love," I whispered through my 
tears.  The pain was unbearable, like an emptiness in my heart, a black 
hole of never feeling loved, being hated through all the years before 
Tenchi.  "I'll miss you."  I fell onto my knees, crying.
(Zero)
"She cries without anyone to comfort her," I whispered.  Tenchi 
looked up at me in surprise.
"Ryoko?"
"No, she is stuck on the other side, in great sorrow.  She will 
lose all of her memories with you, and even all her feelings for you."  
I could feel her pain in my own heart.  It must be terrible to lose the 
only thing in life worth living for.
"She is stuck on the other side?  What side?"
"The spirit world.  She is just inches away from us."  I passed 
my hand through she would be.  "It's terrible to not be able to be by 
the one you love.  To be separated by a wall that is not there, just 
inches away from touching you, it would be too hard for me to bare."  I 
turned to face Tenchi.  I tried to hide my tears, but they wouldn't 
stop flowing.  "I can feel her inside of me.  It's like she's slowly 
drifting away from everyone.  Before I joined her, nobody even cared 
for her.  She was all alone.  Do you know how sad it would be to lose 
everyone, to feel like you're all alone in all of space, no one to care 
for you?"
Tenchi stared at where Ryoko would be.  His face was full of 
grief.  It became very quiet in the room.  "Will she ever be able to 
join with you?"
"No."  His eyes closed painfully.  He was trying to hold back his 
tears.  
"All of it gone.  All of our memories, just gone." 
(Tenchi)
Ryoko. My Ryoko, just gone. She won't remember what we shared, 
what we had together. She would be just drifting off into depression, 
with nobody to save her. I won't be able to protect her this time. 
"Zero?"
"Yes?"
"We have to go and save her. We have to find her. We just have 
to."
