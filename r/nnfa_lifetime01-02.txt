No need for a lifetime! 
Book I: Rebellion 
Chapter 2: no need for broken hearts!

Welcome back! Read on!


Tenchi stared at the floor all day as he worked, thinking one thing 
<why me? First grandfather dies then Ryoko leaves and now Washu thinks 
that Mayuka is dieing, again!> a tier fell to the floor "Ryoko" he 
whispered under his breath. As Tenchi walk in the house he saw what he 
had seen for the past two days, a sad Sasami sitting on the couch, tier 
struck for Ryoko leaving, a sick and sad Mayuka lying next to Sasami, 
every now and then squeaking(in her low, little voice)"mama", an Kiyone 
and Mihosie, nether crying, but both rather sad looking, sitting on the 
loveseat, Aeka sitting on the chare looking as though she had wiped her 
eyes repeatedly to clean the tiers off her face, washu wasn't there, 
she had been in her lab for days 
"Should I make dinner?" Tenchi asked and Sasami nodded "ok" he didn't 
mind cooking, but he still wish he could just go lay down <why me?> he 
thought once more

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ryoko sat on the soft feather bed and stared out the window and wonder 
<did Tenchi understand what I said? Will he fallow me? Should he? 
Tenchi.> she fell face first into her pillow and cried herself to sleep 

..............................

Tenchi laid down on his bed and stared into space and then thought back 
to the day before grandfather die 

(Saturday)

Tenchi walked into the living room <finely! Its Saturday, no chores, no 
school! Its.> he stopped him self. Ryoko was standing in her bikini in 
the living room, smiling, looking under all the furniture till she 
looked under the couch, out of which she pulled out a small Mayuka, who 
was wearing a small bikini to mach Ryoko's and holding a big pile of 
towels, laughing as Ryoko tickled her before she teleported them both 
to the bath <she a good mom to Mayuka>
"she'd be just good wife" Tenchi turned to see grandfather "I know it" 
his eyes twinkled when he said that then he walked away <I wish he'd 
stay out of my mind.>

Tenchi sat on the roof, think about what his grandfather had said till 
he heard Ryoko sit next to him
"ill leave if you want me too" 
"no, its fine" Ryoko smile at him when he said this "so, you got Mayuka 
to bed early?"
"yeah, but I figure she'll have one of those nightmares soon" she bit 
her lip "poor thing"
"she'll be alright as soon as Washu's done with that thing"
"i.." before she could finish she slipped. Tenchi went to grab her but 
fell himself, when they hit the ground he was on top of Ryoko "i...umm" 
before she could she anything Tenchi leaned forward to kiss her 
"MAMA!!!!!!" they both heard Mayuka yell at the top of her lungs
"I have to go" Ryoko vanished up to Mayuka's room
"damn it!" Tenchi hit the ground with his fist, he love his darter very 
much but that was one reason why he let the girls take care of her, she 
was annoying some times. 


(back in Tenchi's room)

"humm..I wonder what grandfather meant..."  Tenchi squirmed a little 
and went to sleep



(in Ryoko's room in the palace)

"umm..." Ryoko was have a fitful sleep, for the one thing she tried not 
to think about had slip into her dream 

(late Sunday night)

"Ryoko, im going to have you watch Yohso for me so we all can get some 
sleep, you like to sleep in the day any way..." Washu left Ryoko to 
make sure that Yohso didn't have another heart attack 
"you know, you look just like you did when we left jurai" Yohso said 
when washu had left. She turned to face him "do you even remember?"
"of course, I could never forget" she went and sit down next to the bed
"I bet you just remembered it"
"close, last night" she smiled 
"when I go protect Tenchi for me, protect him like you did me" he 
closed his eyes
"Yohso?" she shook him "ho no.." she ran and pressed the button to call 
washu

(in Ryoko's room)

"Yohso!" Ryoko sat bolt right in the dark room, the only light in there 
was the three moons of jurai <stop it, Ryoko! He's dead and he good as 
told you to leave Tenchi for Aeka! I gotta sleep, I start my duties as 
Misaki vanaic> she flopped down on her pillow and went back to 
sleep(only after taking two big drinks, one for the bottle of strong 
tea, fallowed by the bottle of sake, the WHOLE bottle)   





Well bye now!
