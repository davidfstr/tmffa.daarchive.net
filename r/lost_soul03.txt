Lost souls: act 3: if we must.


So, back for more? Well thank you! Ok then, read on, I have no more to 
say, oh and yet again, this is not a Tenchi Ryoko story, it's a maskai 
story! 




It was 2 week's before x-miss, tenchi was at the nearby palm plaza mall 
looking for a wedding ring.

 
"Umm, miss?" Tenchi asked 
"Yes, how may I help you?" the clerk asked 
"I need a ring"
"I know what kind, infact, you're the fifth one today
"Which one?"
"Humm" Tenchi as he pointed at a small ring that had a diamond in the 
shape of a heart on it 
"That one" he said
"Ok what size?" she said holding a small piece of paper up
"That one" he said pointing at one of the many fingers"
"Ok, that'll be 1,000 dollar's" she said as she ducked under the 
counter and pulled out a small box with "love" written on it 
"Ok, thanks" he said as he handed her the money and took the box
<I know she'll love it>
^She will^

It was x-miss, tenchi came home to the loving welcome of his family and 
the girls.
  
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

"Welcome back lord Tenchi" Aeka said as she took he's coat from him
 "Welcome home Tenchi!" Sasami said with a welcoming smile. The other's 
said hi's and welcome home's for two minute's when Tenchi asked
"Where's ryoko?"
"That's news is almost as good as the fact your home Tenchi" Aeka said 
through a smile as all the girl's looked said and almost started cry, 
and Sasami did
"What happened?" Tenchi asked
"Ryoko left for good, we haven't seen her in almost two month's!" Aeka 
said as though the it where good news
"She what?! Where'd she go?!"
"We don't know, she just left. I wish I knew why" Sasami said as she 
hugged Tenchi's arm
"You had good intent for the future Tenchi, to wed the women you love 
and become a good husband for her. I respect that, no chore's tomorrow" 
Yoso 
"How did you.?" Tenchi asked in amazement
"There's a lump in your throat and your pocket, boy" he said as he 
walked away. Tenchi looked down and held the crying Sasami as Aeka 
screamed
"You where going to ask her to-" she fainted.
 "Tenchi, there's some thing you need to know" Washu said
"What is it Washu?" Tenchi asked
"The day she left I did tests and found out she was pregnant, she left 
about an hour or two later" Tenchi turned to stone  
"She's.she's.. I..." he fainted 
"Tenchi?" Sasami asked

 
         
  Tenchi woke that morning and slowly got dressed
<*Sigh* I wish we did have chore's>
^* Sigh* same here^
<It funny, ya know>
^What is? ^
<Knowing>
^KNOWING WHAT? ^
<That she's out there, all alone, pregnant, thinking who knows what>
^I guess your right^
<And im right when I say you are in a bad mood now shes gone> Tenchi 
had wandered into Ryoko's old room. She had left nothing but a book, he 
picked it up,
"Huh?" a small piece of paper fell out. He read out loud 

"Try as we must  
We must turn away  
From the personal problems  
Facing today  
Why must we sacrifice,  
Waste our tears,  
In the pain we've had  
For so many years.  
We must carry on  
Our laughing masks.  
Carry on,  
Forget of our pasts.  
The future's direction  
Is in my palm,  
I bleed before the world  
I must remain calm.  
Try as we must  
to save our land  
Die if we must  
At our own hand.  
We'll fight for our peace,  
Fight for our right.  
Return home,  
To drop our masks at night.  
Two timer of feelings  
Black on white,  
Why must I abandon all,  
And leave to fight.  
Is it the end we're fighting,  
Or is it us.  
Try if we must,  
We'll die if we must,  
We'll kill if we must,  
We'll lie if we must,  
We'll hide if we must,  
We'll abide if we must,  
We'll try if we must,  
We'll carry on if we must,  
We must we must,  
Our feelings are dust.  
Try as we might,  
Is it worth the fight?  
To return to our homes,  
To find tears in the night?"

<Wow, she's good>
^I don't think she made it^
<Hay, look, another piece of paper> Tenchi picked it up and read
"Tenchi,
By the time you read this ill be gone, dead most likely, heart broken 
by you, but you won't care, you'll be to busy marrying Aeka, you wont 
care if neither your child nor I are dead. But know this, I do, I did, 
love you.

Ryoko"

 
"Ryoko." Tenchi said through a tear "we'll find you" he ran down stares
  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


All the girls where at the table, Aeka was popping small egg bites 
Sasami had made in her mouth, Sasami looked torn between being happy 
Tenchi's home and sad Ryoko is gone, Keyione (whom both she and mihosie 
where home as well) was eating over the many report's she had to do, 
Mihosie was asleep and washu was eating while talking to a small her
"Hello Tenchi" Sasami smiled weekly at him
"Good morning lord Tenchi" Aeka said without even looking at him
"Hi Tenchi" keyione said, smiling a week smile as well 
"Morning" Washu said
"Zzzzzzzz" mihosie slept on
"I need to ask all of you something" Tenchi said, a needing in his 
voice 
"What is it Tenchi?" Keyione asked as mihosie woke up
"I need you to come help me find Ryoko"
"Why should we? She'll be fine on her own" Aeka said
"Because of this" Tenchi tossed the paper to her and she read aloud
"Tenchi,
By the time you read this ill be gone, dead most likely, heart broken 
by you, but you won't care, you'll be to busy marrying Aeka, you wont 
care if neither your child nor I are dead. But know this, I do, I did, 
love you.

Ryoko
"Shes going to." Aeka cut off, she wanted Ryoko to leave, not kill her 
self, because some where inside Aeka did care for her
"Ill help Tenchi!" all the girls said at once and so they looked, first 
on land, then in space.
