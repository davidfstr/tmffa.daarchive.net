                           by: Dorothy McCoubrey

I do not own these characters nor do I have copyrights to them. I’m only 15
and this is my first attempt for a fanfic so please don’t sue me, I have no
money.



                              April 8, 1999







       Tenchi , Mihoisi, Kiyone, Washu, Ayeka, and Sasami were all sitting
together talking when Tenchi noticed Ryoko was missing. “Does anyone know
where Ryoko is?” He asked. The girls shrugged. “It’s getting dark I’d better
go look for her,” Tenchi said.









      Tenchi had looked everywhere. “Where could she be?” He asked himself.
Then out of no where he heard a familiar voice. “Ryoko what are you doing
here all by yourself?” he asked. “Just thinking,” she replied casually.
“What brings you here?” She asked. “I was looking for you, I was worried!”
He said. She was shocked. “You worried about me!!!” She cried in disbelief.
“Of course I am!” He said surprised at her remark. “Let’s go back,” he said
taking her hand and helping her up. “He does care about me!!!” She thought
excitedly.





           “What took you two so long?!” Ayeka shouted at them when they got
back. “She was hard to find,” Tenchi said turning to Ryoko and giving her a
big smile. She smiled back, and for a second they were lost in their own
world together. Ayeka noticing this got nervous and broke the silence. “Well
I’m glad your back Lord Tenchi,” she said turning and walking away.
