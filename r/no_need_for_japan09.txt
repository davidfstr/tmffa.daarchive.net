And now, to bring a close to "No Need for Japan". I know, you all love the 
storyline. But fear not, this will not be the last time Raven and the other 
new characters appear. I've put to much into creating them and I'm just 
getting started on character development, so I'm going to continue using them 
in the perviously mentioned "Old Foe, New Foe". But before I begin this final 
part of NNFJ, I'd like to give credit to the following for inspiring the 
creation of Raven's friends:
 
CHARACTER:          INSPARATION:
Drew                Drew "Deviant" M.
Kim             Kim "Sped" N.
Cass                Casandra "Mariana" W.
Patrik              Patrick R.
8:08                Robert R.
Kitty               Daniele ?.
Mel             Melissa B.
Gravey              Eric "Gravey" G.
Chunk and Brain         Chuck and Brian D.
Kris                Kristen L.
Goat                Mike "Goat" M.
Roy             Royal "Mo" B.
6 Guage             Mark "6 Guage" M.

And finaly Troy Long, creator of Mike Wolf. He helped me write "House of 
Horrors", most of the humor in that chapter was spawned from his brain. He 
also thought up that about Mike getting trapped in the basement, so theres 
his credit for his work. 

Now, as for those who created "Tenchi Muyo!", thats all property of Pioneer 
Entertainment. But all the characters you see listed here are MINE/OURS, any 
likeness to any of them will be destroyed....

From the Diary of Kiyone Makibi:

Dear Diary,

Well we're finaly going home. It seems like it's only been four weeks, as 
opposed to the reality of nearly five months. God the time has flown.....

I've packed all my physical baggage, it's stowed on the plane. But as I sit 
on this plane, and write (which I have time for due to EXTREME delays), I 
can't help of all the things in my mind that aren't quite bolted down. My 
head feels heavier, not in a physical sense, in a physical sense its lighter 
due to the fact that I cut over a foot and a half of hair off. It's more 
like, more like I'm taking stuff around in my mind. Stuff that I might not 
need, but I hold onto for safe keeping. Memories, song lyrics, faces, stuff 
from school....

My, how the list goes on and on. There's so much, how am I going to remember 
it all? I figured the best way to do that, is to write it down. Maybe this 
will help me clear my mind...

Mihoshi, thats one thing I want to write down. I can't believe she's not 
going back. She made her 
announcement at the farewell party, but I'll get into that more later. In any 
sense, she's staying with Raven. She's going to go to school another 
semester, and then settle down after graduation. We're going back for the 
wedding, then I'll see her on holidays, but thats it. She quit the GP, they 
should have got her notice by now. I know I always said she was annoying, and 
I'd KILL to be rid of her, but only as a partner. She's still a great friend, 
best I've had. Sure she's with Raven, meaning she's in good hands, and visa 
versa. And it's also true that we're going to be sisters-in-law but that 
doesn't make up for the fact that we're going to be apart. I had always hoped 
Raven would come with us when we went back, and I'd see him all the time.

Raven, he's graduated and is going on with his life. He's got a fiance, a 
bright future in the arts or music, and for the most part I'll never see the 
guy. We were seperated for several years. I thought he'd died, but it was all 
just a hoax, which I somehow knew. He confessed to me, after the party, that 
he'd done it because he didn't want to follow in fathers footsteps. Dad was a 
GP from age 20, and he wanted Raven and I to be like him. He'd always yell at 
my brother for being different, not wanting to conform, wanting to be 
something he didn't want his son to be. It killed Raven. And the funny thing 
is, the more he got yelled at, the more different he became.  Eventualy, dad 
stuck us in the academy early. Age 13, and stuck in the GP academy. I'd 
always wanted to go, and my dad was proud of me for that. He was also beaming 
because he thought he'd finaly broke my brother's will to rebel. Well Raven, 
wanting to go into forensics and computer systems at the time, used the 
knowledge of these subjects to make a convincing crash on a routine patroler 
training session. He was monitered by the computer, so he didn't have to 
worry about hurting anyone but himself.  He uploaded a program that made a 
SOS message then he made it look as if the patroler crashed in Indiana. He 
had us fooled the whole time, just so he could get what he wanted.

Dad went balistic after that, he drove my nose to the grindstone harder and 
harder. Wanting me to be top in my class, which I wanted anyway. He got what 
he wanted, a kid in the GP. So I knew he was happy, but I realy wasn't. I had 
suspicions that Raven was alive, but sometimes that got so hard to 
believe....I wanted to die. Raven ment everything to me, and when he 
dissapeared/died I was lost. That might be why I could never get a guy, I 
always compared them to my brother. I don't mean I was IN LOVE with Raven, 
thats just disgusting. I just felt so attached to him, we had never really 
been seperated before, and with him gone I was only half a person. Almost 
knowing he was alive, that kept me alive.....

Well onto other subjects, hopefully happier ones. Lets take that party for 
example. That was a time....

Raven was graduating, and we were leaving, so it was decided that there would 
be a party. We were intending for about 50 or 60 people. But when it was told 
that "Manufactured Youth" would be playing, we ended up with 150+. It went 
from just being a party, to a full on concert. Patrik did the light effects 
with 8:08s help, and we all put our parts in. Some got food, others cleaned 
and others did other things...To many to really discribe, so I'm not even 
going to try. Well, anyway, the party/concert started off with a real BANG. 
Dentalize took the stage, it was pretty cool. They played alot of cover songs 
by Wolfs favorite groups, not suprisingly Wolf was croudsurfing most of their 
set. The band consisted of Chunk on drums, Brain doing vocals, Gravey on 
bass, and Goat on guitar. The next band "Imperfection" was pretty good, their 
style was more of my person favorite. Very upbeat sounding, fast and driving. 
The guitars were suplied by Kitty, Kim did drums, and Mel played bass and did 
vocals. Suprisingly, the vocals were dark compared to the music. Also, to my 
suprise, Washu did a song with them called "Mind is my Own", I'll give that 
girl some credit, she's got real stage energy and a nice voice.

Finaly, "Manufactured Youth" took the stage. I never realy like EXTREMELY 
heavy music. But this, this was...well its hard to say. It was heavy, loud, 
fast, insane, and overall wicked. The croud had turned into a giant mosh pit 
durring this set. I could see people I knew getting passed around on the 
hands of the croud. Ryoko, Mihoshi, even little Sasami went by overhead. I 
even joined the action with 8:08's help and encouragement. I was scared to do 
it at first, but after 8:08 told me it was safe and assured me of it, I 
tried. It was amazing, I had no control, yet I was in full control. Nothing I 
had ever experienced gave me this feeling.

And the stage show, it was indescribeable. Each member of the band had their 
own little "act" they did. They were billed as such:

Drew, the Hunchback of 69. Drew hunched down low to the crowd and growled and 
screamed his lungs out. He has a real "in your face" attitude, and he doesn't 
hold it back one damn bit. Throughout the show, he threw food, jumped around 
and tore himself up something awful.

Roy, Shock Therapy. Roy's shaved his hair into a mohawk. It looks pretty 
weird on him, but who am I to judge? He's another nut out there on stage, he 
screams, thrashes about and acts like he's conected to a live wire or 
something. But his drumming skills are something else.

Cass, Living Dead Girl. Cass does keyboards. She's good at it, and she's got 
a good persona too. She looks like a modern vampire, complete with fake fangs 
that look almost real.  She stands in back, looking all dark and brooding, 
than from nowhere she lets out a mad cackle or scream.

Then theres my brother.

He's billed as "Raven, The Mechanical DevilBoy". He plays guitar, and seems 
to be the most focused of the group. His act consists of acting like he's 
some sort of automoton, starting the set off hunched over like he's out of 
power, and when he actualy starts moving its real jerky. The devil boy thing 
comes from these two peices of hair on the back of his head he gels into 
horns.

It all comes together, somehow. Its weird but it makes for a dynamic stage 
show. Well that night was our last big fling. The next day we were packing, 
and here we are. Mike and Ryoko are keeping in touch, Ayeka has developed 
some fixation with Patrik, and I'm really gonna miss 8:08. We each found a 
guy, but theres still competintion. Washu and Ryoko both are into Mike, so 
every now an the tword the end of our trip Washu tried to get close to Mike 
and get Ryoko out of the way. But Mike's taken, Ryoko managed to seduce him 
the night of the party. Right at the end of Youth's last song we all heard 
"THANK YOU GOD!" from Mikes room. And when they came down  the crowd all 
started aplauding. You should have seen the looks on their faces. Well, for 
now this is goodbye. The plane is preparing to leave, and though I know I 
won't, I feel I'll be seeing my American friends very soon.....
