NOTE : This is a slight remake of a fanfic I worked on earlier.  When I say 
slight, I mean I changed the name of my character in the story, and fixed
some few errors.  Sorry for all the trouble.  This is a work of pure fiction.  
These characters do not belong to me, except for Sei.  Tenchi Muyo is 
owned by AIC and Pioneer.  Don't sue me for I am using your characters 
in a respectable manor.  The story and future characters belong to me, and 
if anyone else wishes to use it, please give me credit.  Please note that 
this is a continuation of the OVA series, but I also took some topics, 
ideas, and events from the TV series as well.  ENJOY!!

No Need for Lies!/
Fatal Encounters

Dialogue Key : 
"~~~" for characters who are speaking
(~~~) for characters who are thinking 

    (Note!  Flashback!)  Since being a mercenary, Sei had seen many 
extraordinary things, but non quite as amazing as Tokimi's realm.  He was 
overwhelmed by the vastness and complexity of this dimension.  When he was 
asked to come to this part of the universe by a strange man, he had no idea it 
would be like this!  As he stood on the floating platform, he could actually 
tell some of the galaxies he saw in the empty void of the realm.  It was almost 
like a window to all the solar systems in the universe.

    The floating platform finally made a stop.  Everything went black.  Sei 
was startled for a moment.  "Hey what the…"  He was cut off when a bright 
flash of light shinned on him.  There was no need to cover his eyes since he 
was wearing sunglasses.  Suddenly, a being appeared in front of him.  It was 
D-3, the servant of Lady Tokimi.  (This was the old fart who told me to come 
over here!  But he looks different, and his head is huge!)

    At first, there is silence.  There were no words or gestures given by 
either men.  They stood, staring at each other as if they known one another 
before.  Sei felt like he remembered this man from somewhere, but he doesn't 
recall ever meeting him.  His eyes reminded him of someone dark and mysterious.  
Someone he knew, that caused great agony in his life.  But he quickly dismissed 
the idea, and decided to find out why he was here.

    "You wanted to see me?" said Sei, breaking the silence that seemed to last 
forever.  D-3 was almost startled at the voice of Sei.  (He doesn't remember?!)  
He looked at Sei, realizing that he doesn't recognize who he truly was.  

                         "Yes," responded D-3.  "Your services are required by 
someone very important."
                         "Well, who is this 'important' person who needs my 
help so bad?"
                         "You wouldn't know her.  Her name is Lady Tokimi."

    Sei thought of this for a moment.  (Lady Tokimi?  I never heard that name 
before.)

    "Lady Tokimi, eh. Who is she?"  D-3 squinted his eyes, peering at the 
golden-hared mercenary.  "Lady Tokimi is an eternal being of great power 
and wisdom.  She is nothing short of a goddess."  Sei interrupted, not fully 
understanding the situation.  "Wait a minute!  Hold up!  If this Lady Tokimi 
is so damn great, why the fuckin' hell does she need help from a normal person 
like me?"  D-3 was outraged by the outlandish behavior of the mercenary.  (He 
still hasn't changed!)  "Silence impotent whelp!"  Sei gave a mean look at 
D-3.  The servant calmed down and continued.  "Although Lady Tokimi is quite 
powerful, she would like to remain, anonymous.  Her identity would be safer 
that way."  That was only part of the reason.  D-3 hoped that will keep 
Sei from proceeding with the question.  "Oh," says Sei, "that's makes sense, 
I guess."

    Sei looked around again, still astounded at the sights of this place.  
"So, what does she need me for then?"  D-3 smirked, showing the first signs 
of human emotions in him.  "Straight to the point, huh?  Very well, we…"  D-3 
was interrupted by a mental message from Lady Tokimi.  "What's that Lady 
Tokimi?  You would like to tell him yourself?  Very well then."  Sei looked 
confused for a moment.  (What the hell is going on here?)  "Lady Tokimi would 
like to speak to you herself.  You should be honored.  Not many people have 
the chance to talk to Lady Tokimi in person."  The look of confusion was 
wiped away.  "Lucky me."

    D-3 disappeared.  Everything went dark again.  Without warning, a large 
flash of light was emitted in front of Sei.  The light was blinding.  Sei had 
to cover his eyes, despite the fact he was wearing sunglasses.  When the 
flash faded away, there stood in front of him was Lady Tokimi.  For a moment, 
he couldn't believe what he saw.  Everything about her was unreal.  Her 
presence, although awe inspiring, had an eerie impression.  Sei calmed 
himself down, realizing this is an important matter.

    "So you are the mercenary Sei Shikyru?" says Lady Tokimi, her voice filled 
realm with a ghostly echo.  Sei stood his ground.  "Yeah, that would be me,"
said Sei, trying to sound cool and calm.  "Impressive.  You're not afraid of 
me."  Lady Tokimi peered at Sei, eyeing him from head to toe.  "Most men in 
your position would tremble to their knees in fear."  Sei remain silent, a 
stern look was the only impression he gave her.  "Hmph.  Anyway, I have 
a very important assignment for you, Sei Shikyru."  Everything went black, 
and Sei woke up from his sleep.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Sei had fallen asleep since his ship left for the sol system.  It had been 
what would be a span of two Earth days since he kidnap Kiyone.  He turned 
around and looked at the back of the room.  There he saw Kiyone.  She was 
inside a giant orange bubble, still unconscious from the knock-out gas.  
The orange bubble was a special containment field designed to be a mini prison.  
(Good.  She's still asleep.  The last thing I need is some woman bitching at me 
all day.)

    He turned around and pressed a button on the dashboard.  "Computer, are we 
in the sol system yet?"  After several beeps, the computer responded.  "Yes 
sir.  We are now approaching the farthest planet in the sol system, Pluto."  
"Okay, good."  He pressed several more buttons, and a holographic map of the 
sol system appeared in front of him.  "Galaxy Police Headquarters is stationed 
near one of these planets.  If I try to pass, they sure as hell will get 
every GP officer they got to shoot our asses down."

    He paused, until he found the exact location of the GP headquarters.  It 
was located near Saturn.  Sei popped his knuckles and began typing on his 
keyboard.  "Computer, set all scanners on all on-coming GP regulated ships."  
"Acknowledged."  After several seconds, he stop typing and leaned back against 
his chair.  "Now all I got to do is wait for that detective Mihoshi to get here."

    It was a sunny afternoon in the Masaki household.  In the carrot patch, 
Tenchi was pulling carrots for Sasami.  They were low on food, mainly because 
of Ryo-Ohki's seemly unsatisfiable hunger for carrots.  After several hours, 
Tenchi lay his bag, which was filled with a least ten dozen carrots, down on 
the ground and laid back, exhausted from all the work he did.  (Well, that' the 
last of them.)  After several minutes, Tenchi got up from his rest and picked 
up his bag.

    Tenchi was on his way back to the house, when he notices rumbling in the 
far end of the carrot patch.  Tenchi quickly dropped his bag and ran towards 
the site of the disturbance.  When he reached it, he saw a carrot get pulled 
back into the Earth.  "What the.." said Tenchi aloud.  Then another carrot got 
pulled inside the ground.  Tenchi quickly grabbed the third carrot before 
it was pulled in.  He yanked the carrot out with all of his strength.  Attached 
to the end of the carrot was Ryo-Ohki, nibbling excessively.  "I thought so."  
The little cabbit meowed softly, it's large floppy ears hung down in a sad, 
melancholy state.  Ryo-Ohki looked at the Tenchi with her large golden eyes, 
and that made Tenchi want to puke.

    Tenchi sighed, and let go of the carrot.  "Okay, you could have it."  
The cabbit's face brightened up with joy and happiness as it meowed loudly.  
You could actually see the sparkles start to form in Ryo-Ohki's eyes.  Ryo-Ohki 
took the carrot and scampered off into the house.  Tenchi wiped the sweat off 
of his brow and looked up at the sky.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Back inside the house, not much was going on.  Ayeka and Ryoko were 
watching a soap opera in the living room, while Sasami was cleaning dishes 
in the kitchen.  "Big sister," said Sasami aloud, trying to get Ayeka's 
attention, which seems glued to the TV set.  "Yes Sasami," replied Ayeka, her 
attention still focused on the soap opera.  "Where did Mihoshi go?  She didn't 
come back for breakfast."  "Knowing her, she probably got lost in another 
solar system," says Ryoko in a smirking voice.  "Quiet, both of you!" screamed 
the first crown princess of Jurai.  "It's getting to the juicy part!"

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    In Washu's lab, the greatest scientific mind of all time is prepared to 
start the experiment again.  Last time she tried to find the origin of Clay's 
and Zero's memory loss, she lost all of her data in a mysterious accident.  
But now, the little red-headed genus is ready to start over.  "Okay, here we 
go," said Washu to herself.

    Suddenly, two Washu puppets appeared on her shoulders.  "Yeah, go for it 
Washu!" screamed Washu puppet A in her usual squeaky voice.  "You could do 
it Washu!" screamed Washu puppet B in an equally squeaky voice.  Washu popped 
her knuckles and began to type down numbers.  After several hours of endless 
typing, Washu finally stopped for a break.  She opened a dimensional portal and 
pulled out a glass of water.  She swigged it down with one gulp.  Washu 
continued to type for thirty more minutes, until she was finally done.

    She sat cross-armed, looking ever-so proud.  "I did it, for a second time!" 
said Washu excitably, throwing a peace sign.  Both Washu puppets began to 
clap and shot words of encouragement.  She began to laugh maniacally again.  
"Am I great or what?!"  On the keyboard of her transparent laptop was a large 
red button label INPUT.  "Here we go!"  She pressed the button, and the 
translucent computer blew up in her face.  Smoke filled the air as Washu began 
to cough.  Her face was pitch-black, and her hair looked like it's been in 
a blender.  "Back to old drawing board," said Washu in a weary voice.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    In the far reaches of the sol system, Sei waits impatiently for First Class 
Detective Mihoshi.  He opens a can of beer and takes a large gulp that nearly 
depleted it.  "Will that blond-headed bitch get her fucking ass here already," 
said Sei angrily to himself.  He takes one last gulp of the beer, finishing it 
off.  It tossed the empty can in the back of the cockpit.  The beer can knocked 
against the containment bubble, instantly waking up Kiyone.  She was weary-
eyed for a moment, her head was pounding due to the effects of the knock-out 
gas Sei used earlier.  "Where am I?" pondered Kiyone allowed.

    Sei turned around, surprised to see Kiyone awake.  "So you finally woke up," 
said Sei.  "Uh?"  Kiyone was clueless for a moment, but then realized what was 
happening.  "Oh yeah, I was trapped in deep space, then you…you…" her voice 
trailed off for a moment, thinking about the situation.  Suddenly anger was 
building up in the green-hared officer.  "Hey, let me out of here right now, 
jerk, or I arrest you for assaulting an officer!"  Sei smirked, and got up 
from his chair.

                           "Whatever, Detective Kiyone."
                           "Let me out of here, asshole!!  I bust you up for 
so many felonies, it'll make your head spin!!"
                           "Yeah, I heard that line from a lot of GP officers 
before.  But I need you as insurance so I could get that blonde-headed ditz 
of a partner you have."
                            "You mean Mihoshi?!"
                            "Yep."
                            "What do you want with her?"

    Sei told Kiyone everything.  He told her how he was ordered by an employer, 
he wasn't going to say her real name, to kidnap Tenchi and the others.  He 
said he needed Mihoshi so he could go into the sol system without being 
detected by Galaxy Police Headquarters.  He also told her he needed to get 
rid of the King of Jurai since he stationed himself near planet Earth.

                               "I see, but what do you need me for?" asked 
Kiyone.
                               "You know, for a GP detective, you're pretty 
stupid," replied Sei in a harsh tone.

    Kiyone flicked Sei off.  Sei merely smirked, and turned around, his 
back facing the GP officer.  "If Mihoshi found out I have her long lost 
partner whom she believe to be dead, she would do anything to see you again."  
Kiyone shivered to thought of being Mihoshi's partner again.  It was a worse
fate than being damned to hell.  "Well I won't let you!" screamed Kiyone.  
"I'll get out of this bubble, and when I do…"  Sei interrupted Kiyone.  "I 
doubt it, Detective Kiyone."  Kiyone gritted her teeth, hatred towards this man 
was building inside of her.

    All of a sudden, the computer started to beep.  "Galaxy Police regulated 
ship found."  A image appeared before the mercenary.  It was Mihoshi's ship 
flying into the sol system.  "She finally made it," said Sei.  "Computer, 
prepare to send a message to that ship."  "Yes sir."

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Back in Mihoshi's ship, the blonde-headed officer is reading one of 
Sasami's mangas that she let her barrow.  Mihoshi had just returned from an 
escort assignment.  She had to see off a Jurain official to planet Jurai, but, 
unfortunately, they got lost in another part of the sol system.  After about 
three days of aimless searching, they finally found the planet Jurai.  Mihoshi 
was exhausted from the trip, but was happy to return home.  (I have to remember 
to thank Sasami for letting me barrow her mangas.)

    Yukinojo appeared from the top of the cockpit.  "Miss Mihoshi?" said the 
robot.  Mihoshi was, of course, not listening since she was too interested in 
the manga that she was reading.  "Miss Mihoshi?"  Still, the GP officer wasn't 
paying attention.  It was almost like she was in her own little dream world.  
"MISS MISHOSHI!!"  Mihoshi fell off her chair, her head spinning from the 
intensity of Yukinojo's agitated voice.

    "Hey!" screamed back Mihoshi.  "It was just getting to good part too!"  
Yukinojo sighed, a large sweat drop was forming on his head.  "Sorry to 
disturb you, Miss Mihoshi, but you have a message on line one."  "Really?" 
said Mihoshi in her usual clueless voice.  "Tell whoever sent me the message 
to call back later."  "But he says it's very important."  Mihoshi crumpled the 
manga that was in her hands.  She slammed both fists and the scrunched up 
manga on the top of her dashboard.  "I told you, I'm busy!"  Then Mihoshi 
looked down at her manga, realizing what she had done.  A large sweat drop 
was starting form on the forehead of the blonde-headed detective.  "Oh no," 
said Mihoshi in a helpless voice.  "Sasami's manga…What do I do?  She's going 
to be very angry with me."

    Mihoshi went into one of her little fits, tears starting to form in her 
bright blue eyes.  Soon those tears turned into floods as she cried her eyes 
out.  Yukinojo sighed again.  (Why do I put up with her?)  "AHEM!"  Mihoshi 
looked up, still sniffling.  "Now, Mihoshi, what do should I do with the 
message?"  Mihoshi had a dumbfounded look on her face.  "Uh, what message?" 
said Mihoshi in her usual 'I don't have a clue' voice.  Yukinojo nearly fell 
backwards.  If he weren't connected to the ship, he might have crashed through 
floor.  "The message that's on line one!!" screamed a very pissed off Yukinojo.  
"Oh," said Mihoshi, now realizing what's going on, "that message.  Okay then, 
Yukinojo, put it through."  "Yes, mam."

    A translucent screen appeared in front of Mihoshi.  On the screen was the 
mercenary Sei Shikyru.  He had his usual sunglasses on, and he had a stern look 
on his face.  Mihoshi looked dumbfounded for a moment.  "Uh, do I know you?" 
asked Mihoshi in a puzzled tone.  "No," Sei replied, "but I know someone who 
knows you."  Mihoshi continued to look clueless.  "Uh, what are you talking 
about?"  "I'm talking about your old partner Kiyone."  The blonde-headed 
policewoman looked shocked.  "K, Ki, Kiyone?!  What about Kiyone?!"

    "Tell me Detective Mihoshi, would you like to see Kiyone again?"  Mihoshi 
was about to say yes, when a thought crossed her mind.  "Hey, how do you know 
my name?"  Sei shook his head, realizing this will take a while.  "That's not 
the point!"  Mihoshi looked confused.  "So, what exactly is the point?"  Sei 
felt like he wanted to hit something, hard.  The golden-hared mercenary 
clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.  "The point is do you want to see 
Kiyone again!!"  The look of confusion was wiped away from Mihoshi's face.  
"Oh, now I get it."  A large sweat drop was starting to take form on the side 
of Sei's head.  (Frankly, I'm quite surprised.)

    In the background, Kiyone was listening to their conversation.  She giggled 
a little, amused at how easily Mihoshi was pissing Sei off.  (Good, he deserves 
it!)  Suddenly, another thought came across the bright-eyed, but not very 
bright-minded, Mihoshi.  "Wait a minute…"  Sei slumped down on his chair.  
"Now what?"  "Are you trying to say Kiyone's alive?"  Both Kiyone and Sei fell 
backwards.  Ken quickly scraped his way back up to a sanding position.  "What 
the fucking hell do you think I was talking about?!!!"  "Uh, I don't know?"

    Sei's right eye was twitching underneath his sunglasses.  Kiyone looked 
down.  (I guess some things never, ever change.)  Sei swallowed hard, trying 
calm himself down.  After regaining composure, he continued on.  "Listen, 
Detective Mihoshi, your old partner Kiyone is still alive and she wants to see 
you."  Immediately, Kiyone reacted.  She started to slam her fists against the 
containment bubble.  "No I don't!  No I don't!  You keep that blonde-headed 
bitch away from me!!"  Ken turned around, surprised at the green-hared officer's 
reactions.  (I don't really blame her.)  "Uh, what's that noise," asked Mihoshi.  
The mercenary turned around.  "Oh, that's the TV.  Sorry about that."  "It's 
OK."

    Mihoshi thought hard, which really hurt her head.  (Kiyone's alive?!  I 
don't believe it, even though I want to believe it!  But it can't be true!  I 
saw her die and everything!)  Mihoshi was extremely tense now.  She was almost 
afraid to ask her next question.  "Is it really true?  Is Kiyone really alive?"  
Sei smirked.  (Now that's the first reasonable question she asked today!)  "Yes, 
it is true."

    Mihoshi's heart felt like it was going to leap out from her chest.  She 
clapped both hands together, sparkles forming on her bright blue eyes as she 
started to jump around the room hysterically.  "I can't believe it!  I can't 
believe it!"  Ken looked flabbergasted for a moment.  "I don't really believe 
it myself," said the mercenary to himself.

    Mihoshi felt like she wanted to scream, laugh, cry, and sing at the same 
time.  (Kiyone's alive!!  I can't believe it!  It must be a miracle!  An act of 
God!)  All she could feel in her heart and soul was joy.  Joy for the fact that 
her old partner is alive.  It would be the happiest moment in her life.  (Now 
we'll be partners again, and go stay out late, and go to karaoke bars, and talk 
about the good old days!)

    Sei coughed deliberately, trying to get Mihoshi's attention.  "Uh, Mihoshi," 
said Sei aloud again.  She continued to dance around her cockpit, overjoyed 
with utter happiness.  "Mihoshi," said Sei again, this time his voice is a 
little bit louder.  She continued not to listen, and this was really starting to 
piss off Sei.  "LISTEN MIHOSHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  Mihoshi fell backwards by the 
force of Sei's voice.  "Uh, yes?"

    After several moments to regain his control, Sei continued to talk.  "Do 
you want to talk to Kiyone now?"  "Really?!"  Kiyone pounded on the orange 
bubble again.  "No, no, please, I'm beggin' you!!"  Kiyone was on her knees, 
tears were rolling down her checks.  Sei snapped his fingers.  The screen now 
changed to Kiyone, who was scratching at the containment bubble.  "Kiyone!!" 
screamed Mihoshi in a delighted voice.

    Kiyone looked up and saw Mihoshi's face.  She had large sparkles on her 
sky-blue eyes.  (Oh no!  Please God, anything but this!)  "Kiyone, I missed you 
so much!  So much has happened when you were gone.  I was so sad!  You don't 
know how long it's been!"  Mihoshi contiuned on and on about how she missed 
her old partner.  Kiyone slumped down even more, sweat drops were forming 
around her head.  (What is her problem?  Doesn't she see I'm in trouble?!)

    Finally, Mihoshi stopped talking and realized the situation that Kiyone 
was in.  "Uh, Kiyone, why are you inside that bubble for?"  Kiyone's right 
eye was also twitching after that statement.  "It's about time you noticed, 
Mihoshi!  Were you always this dense when I was gone?!"  "Sorry, Kiyone."  
The screen changed to Sei's face.  "Well, that's enough of that."  Kiyone 
sighed a breath of relief.  "Thank you…"  "Hey, I wasn't done talking to 
Kiyone!"  "Yeah, I know, but I need to talk to you now.  You see, Kiyone is 
suffering from a rare disease caused from the contaminated ultra-energy matter.  
That's way she's in that orange bubble, you see."  "Ohhhh…"  "Anyways, she 
has to stay in that bubble or else that disease will spread.  But because of 
that bubble, I can't transport her to your ship.  You will have to come to my 
ship and get her."

    "Okay, where's your ship?" asked Mihoshi.  "Right here."  The image 
changed again.  On the transparent screen was a map of Mihoshi's location.  
To her right was Sei's ship.  "Okay, then, Yukinojo, set course for that man's 
ship."  "Yes mam."  Soon her ship was on her way to meet Sei.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Sei smirked, surprised that this mission was going so well.  "Gullible is 
an understatement."  Kiyone sighed again.  (You can say that again.)

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****   ****

    Mihoshi's ship was now in close proximity with the mercenary's ship.  
Mihoshi took out her cube-key.  She was twisting it in various directions.  
Yukinojo appeared in front of blonde cop again.  "Mihoshi, do you think that 
this is safe?"  "Off course, silly.  I'm a trained official, remember?  I know 
what I'm doing."  "That's what I'm afraid of."  After several turns of the cube-
key, Mihoshi finally disappeared and was teleported to Sei's ship.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Once Mihoshi reached Sei's ship, fear and anticipation was rushing through 
the cop.  One part of her want to see Kiyone again, but another part is telling 
her she should stay away.  She didn't understand why.  (The man who saved 
Kiyone seemed sincere enough.  After all, he did put her in that bubble to keep 
anyone else from getting that disease.)  She just shrugged off the feeling and 
walked forward.

    In front of her was Sei, still wearing his sunglasses.  He had an 
expressionless look on his face.  Next to him was Kiyone, who was in the 
containment bubble.  Kiyone looked like she was screaming at the top of her 
lungs as she punched the orange bubble again intensely.  Actually, she was 
screaming, but Sei had added a sound barrier earlier so Mihoshi couldn't hear 
her protests.  Mihoshi had a sad expression on her face as she walked towards 
Kiyone.

    "Poor Kiyone," she said softly.  "That disease must be making you delirious."  
A disgruntled look was all you could see on the face of the green-hared 
policewoman.  She smashed her checks against the walls of the bubble.  "You 
idiot, can't you see I'm in trouble?!  Don't you see this guy's an A-1 class 
criminal, even if he is a mercenary!?"  Unfortently, Mihoshi couldn't hear the 
protesting words of Kiyone.  She just assumed the contaminated ultra-energy 
matter had made her insane.

    Tears were starting roll down her checks.  All she could feel is pity for 
her old partner.  "Oh Kiyone!"  Kiyone slumped down, giving an expression 
that can only be defined as 'what the hell is going on?'  "Poor Kiyone!  It's so 
sad!  You're gonna' end up in a psycho-analysis ward in the Galaxy Police now, 
and I can't do anything about it!"  Kiyone sighed, and folded her arms.  (I 
would've ended up there anyways if I had to stay with you!)

    Sei walked over to Mihoshi.  She turned around, only to see a serious look 
on his face.  Mihoshi wiped the tears from her checks.  After regaining 
composure, she gave a respectable bow to Kiyone's savior.  "Thank you very much 
for saving Kiyone!  I don't know how to repay you!"  Sei smiled, although it 
wasn't as reassuring as Mihoshi hoped for.  "Think nothing of it, Detective 
Mihoshi."  Moments that seemed like hours passed.  Silence was all that could 
be heard onboard the silver-colored ship.  Kiyone was doing her best to get 
Mihoshi's attention, but all hope for that seemed lost.

    The mercenary handed Mihoshi an odd-looking device.  "Here," said Sei.  
"Take this."  Mihoshi looked bewildered for a moment.  "Uh, what is this?"  
"It's a device that controls that containment bubble.  Just press that red 
button to move it around."  "Ohhh, I see."  Mihoshi pressed the red button.  
A surge of electricity passed through her body.  After several seconds, she 
passed out from the pain.  Sei was standing over the motionless body.  He 
smirked a little, unable to believe how easy it was.  "Dumbass," he said quietly 
to himself.

    Galaxy Police Headquarters.  The mammoth space station hovers over the 
rings of Saturn.  In comparison to size to the Jurain space station that was 
hovering over Earth, the GP Headquarters is probably ten times bigger in mass.  
Onboard the large vessel is some of the universe's top officers.  Among whom 
is the commander, who happened to be Mihoshi's grandfather.  You tell that 
they were related by their pointed ears.  Right now he is sitting in his desk, 
a stack of paper work sits in front of him.  He yawns and looks down, bored to 
death by all the tedious work he had to do.

    Unexpectedly, a transparent screen appears in front of the pointy-eared 
commander.  On the screen is one of the new recruits of the Galaxy Police.  
The commander had a vexed look on his face.  "What is it now?" asked the 
commander in a demanding voice.  "Sorry to bother you sir, but you have a 
message on line three."  The commander yawned again, disappointed at his bad 
luck.  "Who is it?"  "It's Detective Mihoshi, sir."  The commander's eyes 
lightened up.  "Mihoshi?!  Send the message in!"  "Yes sir!"

    The opaque screen disappeared, and a voice messenger was activated.  "This 
is First Class Detective Mihoshi reporting for duty!" said the cherry voice of 
the blonde-headed Mihoshi.  Her grandfather had a big smile on his face.  He was 
always happy to hear her granddaughter's voice, and at a time like this, he 
couldn't be happier.  Then a thought ran across his mind.  (Why doesn't she use 
the messenger on line one?  At least that way we get to see each other.)  He 
thought about this for a moment more, then swayed the notion away.  (I bet the 
messenger on line one is broken or something.)

                  "So, how did the escort assignment go, Mihoshi?"
                  "Oh, it went fine, even though we were held up for a while.  
Don't worry, though.  I saw to it that the chairman of the Holy Counsel got to 
Jurai safely."
                  "That's good.  But what held you up?"
                  "Oh, we ran into the A-1 Class criminal/mercenary Sei Shikyru."

    For a moment, he was shocked.  "Oh no!  Did anything happen?  Did you get 
hurt or…"  The voice of Mihoshi cut him off before he could say anything more.  
"No, I was able to apprehend him, and is now ready to hand him and his ship over 
to your custody."  Again, the commander was speechless.  He couldn't believe 
that Mihoshi was able to capture a dangerous criminal like Sei Shikyru.  "I am 
very, very impressed Mihoshi!  You don't know how happy I am!"  (Jurai's Royal 
Family will be very pleased with this news!  And my job will remain secure!)

    The pointed-eared leader of the Galaxy Police quickly regain composure.  
"Good work, Detective Mihoshi.  You may drop off the mercenary and his ship at 
the southern wing."  "Yes sir!  Thank you sir!"  The message on line three was 
cut off.  Everything was quiet again.  The commander looked out at his window.  
There he was able to see a sea of stars.  (Mihoshi sounded a little strange.  
Almost as if she actually knew what she was talking about!)

    Back at Mihoshi's ship, the notorious mercenary was able to infiltrate the 
ship and took over it's main computer.  He pressed another button.  At the 
back of the cockpit were two orange containment bubbles.  Inside one of the 
bubbles was Kiyone, while in the other one was Mihoshi, who was still 
unconscious.  Sei thought to himself.  (I'm glad I paid the extra five grand 
for that voice simulator.  Never knew it would come in handy.  Now for phase 2!)

    At the southern wing of the GP Headquarters, a hatch opened up.  Several 
tractor beams shot out and snared the mercenary's silver-colored ship.  Once it 
reached it's destination, several clamps locked the vessel in place.  The hatch 
closed.  A group of GP officers ran towards the captured ship.  Several men 
carefully open the main doors to the space craft.  They quietly walked inside, 
holding their laser rifles in readiness.  They made it to the doors of the 
cockpit.  After cautiously opened the doors, they rushed in and aimed their 
guns.  But what they saw horrified them more than any criminal in the universe.

    One of the men swallowed hard, sweat was pouring down his face due to the 
fear he was feeling.  Finally, he was able to speak, despite the tightness in 
his throat.  "Oh shit!  There's a bunch of explosives here!  Everyone get out!"  
And retreat they did.  Soon the entire group of officers ran away.

    One of the officers got to a communication device.  "Commander!" he screamed 
hysterically.  "Commander!  There's a bunch of explosives inside that ship!"  
"Explosives?!" replied the commander.  "Have the bomb squad take care of it!"  
"But sir, they're already there!"  "So what's the fucking problem?!"  "They 
can't defuse the detonator in there!"  "THEY CAN'T WHAT?!?"

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Mihoshi's ship was soon out of range of the headquarters.  Sei took out a 
copper-colored device out of his trench coat.  On the middle of the device was a 
large yellow button.  He pressed that button with he right thumb.

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    Inside the mercenary's ship, a bomb squad member notices something.  
Perspiration was pouring forth like a flood.  "Oh no, the detonator is set to 
blow!!"

    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****    ****

    The GP ship slowed down to a stop.  It was far enough to see the large 
space station.  A screen moved in from the top of the ceiling inside the 
cockpit.  On the screen was a closer view of Galaxy Police Headquarters.  
Sei stood folding both arms around his chest.  Soon, a massive explosion rocked 
the space station.  More explosions followed, until one last gigantic explosion 
took place, emitting off a sky-blue shock wave.

    The fiery remains of the headquarters plummeted down towards the planet 
Saturn.  Sei's face was emotionless.  He turned around, facing a keyboard to 
his right.  He pressed a button, and the screen disappeared.  "Computer," he 
said.  "Set course for the Jurain station."  "Yes sir," said an obedient Yukinojo.

    Tokimi's realm.  The goddess watches what just transpired on a large image 
that was in front of her.  Next to her was D-3, who was also watching intently.  
An expressionless face was all that can be seen on the face of the goddess.  
For a moment, no one said anything.  They were impressed, at least to a point, 
at the persistence of the mercenary.  Finally, D-3 broke the silence.

    "Lady Tokimi, Washu tried to find out about the memory blockage again."  
She didn't say anything.  "Doesn't it worry you, Lady Tokimi?"  "No," said 
the haunting voice of Lady Tokimi.  "it doesn't."  "I see, and what of.. "  "The 
mercenary?" interrupted Tokimi.  "Not to worry, he won't succeed with the 
mission."

    D-3 was silent again.  He wondered if it were true.  After all, he was able 
to destroy Galaxy Police Headquarters, he might have a chance against the Jurain 
station.  "Lady Tokimi, what if he does happen to succeed?"  "Then you will 
have to keep him from succeeding.  All we need is to get rid of the King of 
Jurai, then we could move in with our initial plan."  "Yes, as you wish, Lady 
Tokimi."

    The servant fades away into darkness.  Lady Tokimi then looked at another 
image, this time it is the Masaki house.  "Soon sisters, very soon, we will 
be together again, and we will rule the universe."
