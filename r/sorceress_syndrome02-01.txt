Hello again!  Just in case anyone was wondering, this episode could be 
a while.  Not to mention with the constant building of my website and 
my mom not letting me use the computer.  So, please be patient.  I hope 
everyone gets it by now that I do not own Tenchi Muyo!  But, if anyone 
wants to use Keimosari in a story, feel free.  Just let me know so I 
can read it.  TT4N!

"So, how exactly are we going to get to Sapporo?" asked 
Keimosari.
	"I figured we'd take Kiyone and Mihoshi's patrol ship," answered 
Washu.
	"Are you sure that's a good idea?  I mean, won't a spaceship 
flying over an earthquake seem a little odd?" asked Aeka.
	"Well, how do you suggest we get there?" asked Ryoko bitterly.
	"I figured we could take Washu's dimensional tunnel," said Aeka.
	"That would work, if you two hadn't broken it trying to visit 
Tenchi at the same time," answered Washu.
	"Look, what if we took a plane?" suggested Tenchi.
	"A what?" asked the girls.
	"Um, those things on TV that look like spaceships and can fly," 
said Tenchi.
	"Oh," the others said in unison.
	"But wouldn't that cost a lot of money?" asked Keimosari.
	"Well, we've got some cash right?  If we pool it together we 
should have enough," said Tenchi.
	"Hold on.  For tickets to Sapporo for one child, one pet, and 
eight adults it would cost about--" Washu showed the others the price.
	"Whoa,"
	"Ouch,"
	"Wait, I know!" Keimosari pulled out a bill.  "Can you clone this 
Washu?" 
	"Of course!  I love the way your mind works Keimosari!  We'll 
just counterfeit and go to jail if were caught," said Washu 
sarcastically.
	"Don't worry.  We won't get caught.  And if we would, I could 
just break us out of jail.  I may have lost the Star, but I still have 
my spells," Keimosari explained.
	"You are evil Keimosari.  But it's probably the only way we'll 
get enough money for tickets to Sapporo, so we may as well go along 
with it," Washu said reluctantly.

***************
	Two weeks later, Tenchi, Keimosari, Washu, Ryoko, Aeka, Kiyone, 
Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki were on flight 227 to Sapporo.  
Unfortunately, it was far from smooth.  Ryoko was seriously airsick, 
Aeka had complained about the food, Washu wouldn't get out of the 
bathroom, and Mihoshi had accidentally opened the overhead compartment 
and spilled her carry-on all over the aisle.
	Later, Sasami, Kiyone, and Keimosari were napping when a girl 
approached Tenchi.
	"Excuse me, but is the woman in the bathroom traveling with you?" 
she asked.
	"Um, no.  I've never seen her before," Tenchi lied.
	"Tenchi, can you come in here a minute?  I need you to monitor 
the base on this pH test," Washu called.  The girl laughed.
	"Right.  That's the reason she knows your name, right?" she 
giggled.
	"Yeah.  I'm Tenchi," he said, introducing himself.
	"Nekaia.  Nekaia Mateo," the girl said.  "If that person you 
don't know isn't coming back, can I sit down?  I'm totally bored and no 
one will talk to me."
	"Are you travelling alone?" Tenchi asked.  
	"Uh-huh.  I'm going to Sapporo," she said.
	"Why?" he asked.  The girl opened her mouth as if to answer, but 
then shrugged.
	"I don't know.  Something inside just wanted me to go to 
Sapporo," she said.
	"Hey, how old are you?" he asked. She looked a little young to be 
traveling alone.  Her short blonde hair was pulled into two pigtails.  
She had blue-gray eyes and gold-rimmed glasses.
	"Thirteen," she answered.  She took off her glasses to clean 
them.  Just then, Keimosari woke up.
	"Hey Tenchi.  Who's your friend?" she asked.
	"Kei, this is Nekaia.  Nekaia, this is my sister Keimosari," he 
said.
	"Hmm.  Niki-chan huh?" said Keimosari, naming the girl.
	"Niki-chan?  Puh-leez," said Nekaia, raising an eyebrow.  
Keimosari laughed.
	"Your full name is a waste of letters.  May as well give you a 
nickname," Keimosari said.
	"Look who's talking, Keimosari," said Nekaia.
	"Just call her Kei," Tenchi said, not wanting an argument to 
break out between the girls.
	"Attention passengers.  We will be arriving in Sapporo in about 
five minutes.  Please put your tray tables up and your seat back in the 
full upright position," said the voice over the loud speaker.
	"Well, I'd better go.  Nice meeting you two!" said Nekaia.
***********************************************************************
***************
	At the airport, they began looking for a hotel and a shuttle that 
would take them to it.  Suddenly, someone tapped Tenchi on the back.
	"Niki-ch-I mean, Nekaia!" he cried, stopping himself from calling 
Nekaia the name Keimosari had given her.
	"You guys need help?" she asked.
	"Sure, we could use some help finding a hotel," Ryoko suggested.
	"A hotel?  I think I could help there.  Follow me," said Nekaia.  
The group followed the girl over to a booth.
"The limos are waiting out side.  Come on!" she said.
 Tenchi, Keimosari, Washu and Nekaia and Aeka were in one, and 
Sasami, Ryoko, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Ryo-Ohki were in the other.  As 
they got into them, Tenchi turned to Nekaia.
"Um, how are we going to afford this?" he asked.
"Don't worry, it's taken care of," she answered.  She talked to 
the chauffeurs for a minute, then got in.
"Hope you like five-star hotels," she said.  Tenchi, Keimosari, 
Aeka, and Washu looked at each other.
"How the heck are we going to pay for this?" Aeka asked.
"Relax.  My treat," said Nekaia.
***********************************************************************
***************
	In the other limo, Ryoko was complaining about the flight, while 
Kiyone was yelling at Mihoshi for asking the chauffeur if his name was 
Jenkins.  Only Sasami and Ryo-Ohki were quiet.
	"She just came out of nowhere Ryo-Ohki.  And how's she going to 
pay for these limos and a hotel?  Something's going on Ryo-Ohki, I know 
it," she said to Ryo-Ohki.  Ryo-Ohki just purred.
***********************************************************************
***************
	About a half an hour later, the two limos reached the luxurious 
hotel.  The girls stood in awe as they looked at the high rise.  All of 
a sudden, the ground outside began to shake violently.
	"What's happening?" asked Kiyone.
	"It's another earthquake!" cried Tenchi.  They ran for the 
doorway of the building, but Keimosari stayed behind, her eyes closed.  
A few moments later, the earthquake stopped.
	"Is it over?" Sasami asked.
	"Maybe.  Let's just get into the hotel, and pray for a room on 
the first floor," said Nekaia.
***********************************************************************
***************
	That night, the girls and Tenchi moved into their rooms.  
Keimosari and Washu shared one, Kiyone and Mihoshi in another, Aeka and 
Sasami across the hall, and Ryoko next to Tenchi's room.  Nekaia stayed 
by herself, on the second floor.  Just before bed, Keimosari turned to 
Washu.
	"Washu, those aren't natural earthquakes.  As weird as it sounds, 
I think they were caused by the Earth stone!" she said.
	"Kei, no one can control the Star of Jurai but the Sorceress of 
Jurai, namely you.  And you couldn't have caused that earthquakes, 
since you don't have the Star of Jurai," Washu said.
	"Still-" Keimosari said.
	"Go to sleep.  We'll figure it out in the morning," replied 
Washu.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Ryoko was awoken the next morning by a knock on the door.
	"Ready for breakfast?  There's a great little restaurant around 
the corner," Nekaia called.  Ryoko groaned and looked over at the clock 
radio on the nightstand.  
	"9:00 a.m.?  What the heck are you doing waking me up this 
early?" she yelled.	
	"Come on Ryoko!" came Tenchi's voice.
	"Oh!  Tenchi!  Hold on, I'll be out in a minute," Ryoko called.  
She dressed quickly and opened the door.  Everyone was waiting for her.
	"So, does this place have pancakes?" Ryoko asked.
***********************************************************************
***************
	At the restaurant, Nekaia offered to pay once again.  
Unfortunately, Ryoko and Aeka took this as an invitation to order 
everything in the place.
	"Are they always like that?" Nekaia asked.
	"Yep.  At least, when food comes into it," Keimosari answered.  
Suddenly, there was a loud noise.
	"Another earthquake?" Tenchi suggested.
	"I don't think so!" Kiyone cried.
	A huge stone giant burst through the wall.  It's huge stone fist 
came down on the table next to them.  
	"Okay, this is bad," said Tenchi.
	"Ready Mihoshi?" Kiyone called.  The girls pulled out their guns 
and began firing.  Ryoko pulled out her energy sword and flew toward 
it.  But the giant just got annoyed by Kiyone and Mihoshi's shots, and 
brushed Ryoko away like a fly.  She slammed into a wall, then ducked as 
a display of muffins came at her.  
	"Go Ryo-Ohki!" Sasami cried.  Ryo-Ohki turned into a giant robot 
and Sasami climbed inside.  Ryo-Ohki began fighting the giant, but it 
was too strong.  It pushed Ryo-Ohki into a wall.  But to the monster's 
surprise, the wall began to crash forward right on top of where Nekaia 
and Keimosari were hiding!  With nowhere to go, Keimosari jumped 
forward, and her hands landed on the giant's leg.  All of a sudden, the 
giant stopped.  It grew smaller and smaller until it was the size of a 
pebble.  In fact, it was a pebble.
	"The Earth stone!" Keimosari said in awe.  She closed her fist 
around it, then called for Tenchi to look.  
	"The giant was the Earth stone!  Look!" she opened her fist, but 
it was empty.
	"Not again!" Keimosari cried.
	"Wait Kei!  Your bracelet!" Tenchi cried.  Hanging from the 
silver links was the Earth stone.
	"I don't get it," Washu said.  "The Star of Jurai disappeared, so 
why is the Earth stone here?  Can you control it Kei?"
	"Let me see," she said.  She closed her eyes.  All of a sudden, 
the ground began to shake.  Keimosari opened her eyes.
	"Yeah, I can control it alright.  But I don't understand, the 
power comes from the Star of Jurai.  Without it, the stones aren't 
supposed to work," Keimosari said.
	"So let me get this straight.  Keimosari is a sorceress, but her 
power doesn't work without something called the Star of Jurai.  And the 
earthquakes and the giant were caused by that little rock you call the 
Earth stone.  You people are really confusing," Nekaia said.  The 
others blinked in surprise, before realizing that Nekaia had heard the 
whole thing.
	"Um, yeah, that's pretty much it," Tenchi said.
	"Just, you can't tell anyone, okay?  'Cause without the Star, I'm 
a little more than vulnerable," Keimosari said.
	"Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.  Under one condition," 
Nekaia said.
	"What?" asked Tenchi.
	"I get to hang out with you guys while you're in Sapporo," said 
Nekaia.  Keimosari put her arm around Nekaia's shoulder.
	"You got a deal Niki-chan," said Keimosari.
	"Don't call me Niki-chan," said Nekaia.
***********************************************************************
***************
Back at the hotel, Washu had put another interdemensional lab in the 
mini-fridge.  She had set to work scanning the Earth stone.  All of a 
sudden, a window popped up.
	"Huh?  That can't be right!" cried Washu.  She typed some figures 
but the window popped up again.  "No way!"
***********************************************************************
**************
	The others were relaxing at the pool when Washu ran over to them.
	"You guys!  You've got to come back to the room!  I found 
something major!" she cried.
	Once everyone was dried off and dressed, Washu pointed to the 
computer screen.
	"Now, according to this, the power stones from the Star of Jurai 
have been scattered all throughout the galaxy.  However, there are very 
strong readings coming from what I believe is one of the stones," said 
Washu.
	"Well, where's the reading coming from?" asked Ryoko impatiently.
	"Ireland," Washu answered.
