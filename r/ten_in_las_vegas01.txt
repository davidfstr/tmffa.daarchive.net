Disclaimer : Have I ever told you I don't own any but 1 character. You have, good.
I don't own all of the characters, I only own Braden. The rest belong to AIC and Pioneer.
I don't own the name or company of any airline, hotel, and so on. I don't own them either.
Right now is a bad time to sue me, I can only be rich in Ethiopia. Oh well at least I'm not
paying the IRS yet. So enjoy.
 
Foreword: READ THIS BEFOR READING. <> means what they are thinking, () means they're
doing something or something is happening, and [] tells where they are.
 
[ In the morning at Braden's house, Braden is reading the paper ]
 
Braden: I wonder when I can get those free flights on United.
 
[ Now at Braden's computer ] 
 
Braden: I'm on flight #99, only one more and I can have as many free tickets as I want.
 
( Braden is a 27 year old man from Florida, on to California, and then to Japan where he lives.
He looks in every way like Chandler from the show Friends.)
 
Braden: Now where do I go, oh yes, that San Francisco-Oakland they have.
*******************************************************************
[ One week later Braden and Tenchi are in the Musaki house ]
 
Braden: I got us all free tickets, now its just a matter on where to go.
 
Tenchi: We could go to Florida.
 
Braden: Ayeka doesn't like that, she doesn't like going to nightclubs.
 
Tenchi: You're right, how about New York?
 
Braden: High crime.
 
Tenchi: OK, well how about Hawaii?
 
Braden: Maybe.
 
Tenchi: How about Phoenix.
 
Braden: The last time I flew out of there, my plane was delayed 12 hours. That was
a two hour flight.
 
Tenchi: Well how about Las Vegas?
 
Braden: That will work. I have a house in Henderson.
 
Tenchi: I said Las Vegas.
 
Braden: Henderson is outside of Vegas.
 
Tenchi: Oops, my fault.
 
[ That night at dinner ]
 
( Everyone is eating when Braden calls for their attention )
 
Braden: Thank you, now everyone as you all know I was in California last week. That was
when I took my 100'th flight on United Airlines, and with that I got free tickets for us
to go to Las Vegas.
 
Ayeka: What is this Las Vegas.
 
Braden: A city in Nevada, in the U.S.
 
Ryoko: What's so good about it?
 
Tenchi: Well it has stuff beyond what I can think of.
 
Ryoko: Can you name one thing?
 
Both Tenchi and Braden: Casinos
 
Ayeka: There is no way you're going to get me into one.
 
Braden: There are other things to do there, but you most likely will have to pass through a
casino to get somewhere in the hotel or other place.
 
Ayeka: I guess I can go then.
 
Tenchi: We're going to go tomorrow ok.
 
Sasami: What about me.
 
Braden: There are things for you too.
********************************************************************
[ The next day at Tokyo Int'l ]
 
Ryoko: So Tenchi, will we be sharing a room.
 
Tenchi: No, we're staying at Braden's house.
 
Ayeka: Hopefully its nothing like hi house in Inglewood.
 
Braden: This ones bigger.
 
Ayeka: What class are we in?
 
Braden: 1st
 
Ayeka: How did you get that far.
 
Braden: I get a free seat on flight #50, this was 100, I get as many 1st class seats as I
want.
 
Ayeka: Oh ok
*******************************************************************
[ At Las Vegas Int'l ]
 
Braden: We're here.
 
Ayeka: ( Notices all the slots ) Is this the airport?
 
Braden: Yeah
 
Ayeka: But why are there so many slot machines?
 
Braden: As I said, you can barley go any where here without seeing a slot machine.
 
Braden: < I thought she knew >
 
Tenchi: So you're house is out of town?
 
Braden: Yes
 
Mihoshi: How are we going to get there.
 
Braden: I have a car parked here.
 
Ayeka: That has to be a large bill.
 
Braden: They mail it to me every month.
********************************************************************
[ At Braden's house ]
 
Braden: Here's my house
 
Ayeka: Its bigger than I expected.
 
Tenchi: Yes it is.
 
Braden: I'll have to go get some stuff from the store, ok.
 
Tenchi: OK we'll find something to do.
********************************************************************
[ The next day ]
 
Ayeka: This will be fun I think.
 
Braden: I think so too.
