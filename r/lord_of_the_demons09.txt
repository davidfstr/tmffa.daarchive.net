			 Chapter 9: Destroy the Reactors

	Ryoko opened her eyes slowly and looked around her room a bit. She rolled 
on to her side and pushed herself up slowly. She rubbed her eyes and yawned. 
Still looking around she got up and walked to the door. She saw Washu standing 
in front of the capsule Tenchi was in and typing something in. Ryoko walked out 
of her room and streched while walking toward Washu.
	"What are you doing Washu?" she said and Washu turned her head.
	"Reviving Tenchi and the other two, it's time for them to be awakened."
	"Can't we just leave Ayeka like that?"
	"No Ryoko, we need her help too."
	"No we don't, I can take care of Atmos with my bare hands."
	"If I remember correctly he was the one that took care of you, twice."
	"He caught me off guard!" Ryoko snapped as Washu typed more.
	"Whatever," she muttered and then hit one more key. "And there I got it!" 
	The clear glass top to the bed rose up and vapor came out of the bottom. A 
beeping was coming from the panel as the vital signs went dead.
	"Washu!" Ryoko yeled but Washu waved her hand.
	"Don't worry, the body is just trying to adjust and wake up." The vital 
signs came back on and Tenchi's heart beat stabilized. He stirred a little and 
then settled.
	"Whats wrong?" Ryoko asked worried.
	"Just a muscle spasm, nothing more, feeling and brain function should 
return soon. I'm going to go and get Lady Ayeka and Sasami up." Tenchi lay 
lifelessly as Ryoko stared at him. Suddenly Tenchi jolted up from laying down 
and knocked Ryoko over in fright.
	"Atmos!" Tenchi yelled and fell out of bed matted with sweat and panting. 
He scrambled up and looked at Washu. 
	"W -- Washu?" 
	"Yes, welcome back Tenchi," She said and walked to him.
	"What? Where are we?" Tenchi asked as Washu helped him up to his feet. 
	"We are in a sub-space laboratory I set up myself after Ryo-Ohki and I 
escaped from Hades."	
	"Hades . . . where is Atmos?"
	"Still where its always been."
	"Then, where was I?"
	"You were in a fabricated world created by Atmos to stall you while he 
built his energy beam to strike Jurai."
	"The ring . . ."
	"Fried, I don't know what happened but it seems Atmos overloaded it when 
he changed the system around." Tenchi walked to Ryoko and helped her up. She 
stood with tears in her eyes and gave him a hug. 
	"Tenchi, I thought you were dead!" Ryoko cried. "I didn't know what to 
do."
	"Don't worry Ryoko I wont let him get you or any of us."
	"What does that mean Tenchi?" Washu asked and Ryoko looked up at him.
	"It means I have a plan to stop Atmos from gathering anymore energy."
	"How?" 
	"Miss Washu, just revive Ayeka and Sasami then I'll tell you."

	Hours later Ayeka and Sasami were up and around. They shared the same kind 
of delusionary qualities as Tenchi had but recovered quickly and soon attended 
the planing meeting Tenchi arranged. They all sat in a semi-circle watching 
Tenchi attentively. He sat in front of them and he cleared his throat.
	"So, our first plan didn't go over to well. So what, we can still fight. 
Everyone is here now and all we need to do is defeat Atmos and stop him from 
destroying Jurai. And how do we do that?"
	"How do we do that Tenchi?" everyone asked in unison.
	"Well, it goes like this, the first step would be to cut off all power to 
his beam. Then it's simply we defeat Atmos and seal Hades up forever."
	"All so simple until one minor problem," Washu said.
	"What's that?"
	"The power it took for the king of Jurai to seal Hades up paralized him 
for life. He is now just a vegetable waiting to die."
	"Geez Washu, thanks a lot."
	"Sorry Tenchi, didn't mean to rain on your parade but this is the truth," 
Washu explained and cleared her throat. "The four moons are suppling the beam 
with power, so if we did shut the power off the beam would falter and possably 
explode. So if we cut the power now, we could overload the beams structural 
integrity and ultimatly destroy Hades and the four moons."
	"But Miss Washu, what about Jurai?" Sasami asked.
	"Jurai would be far enough away from the initial blast for it to be 
ineffective."
	"But what if we don't cut the power?" Ryoko asked in worry.
	"Well, we think of something and very quickly."
	Everyone looked at each other in worry after Washu had said that. She 
looked at them and cleared her throat again.
	"Right, then you will travel to the moons and cut the power to ultimatly 
stop Atmos from destroying Jurai, and taking control of the universe," Washu 
said looking around. "Sasami, I'm going to need your help with this process."
	"Okay," Sasami said and looked to her sister Ayeka.	
	"Don't worry Sasami, with Lord Tenchi, Ryoko, and I it should be no 
problem."
	"What about me?" Mihoshi asked and Ayeka sighed.
	"I'm sure you'll do fine too Mihoshi!" Sasami said enthusiastically. 
	"Alright, all we need to do now is figure out who goes where," Ryoko said 
and nodded to Washu.
	"I think it should go accordingly, Ayeka, you get Cygnus 7, Ryoko, you 
have Regal, Tenchi, Fortunas is yours and Mihoshi, Ishtar is yours."
	"Why do I get Ishtar! I don't wanna go back, it's too scary there, I don't 
wanna go!" Mihoshi screamed as she remembered what Ishtar was acctually like. 
	"Fine, Ryoko trade off with Mihoshi."
	"No way, I'm keeping mine," Ryoko said firmly until she was lifted off the 
ground. "Let me down damn it!"
	"Listen to your mother and give Mihoshi your planet."
	"Fine, I'll take Ishtar, now let me down!" Ryoko was lowered and she 
looked at Mihoshi in anger.
	"Big baby," she said and made a face at her.
	"Am not!" Mihoshi yelled back. Washu took a deep breath and sighed as they 
argued.
	"Will you both SHUT UP!" she yelled and they both stopped. "Now then, we 
must act quickly and get to these moons and stop Atmos from destroying Jurai. I 
have calculated the time it will take for him to build that beam, and it doesn't 
look good."
	"How much time is left?" Tenchi asked looking back.
	"About ten minutes," she said and everyone looked at each other. 
	"That isn't enough time!" Ayeka yelled.
	"Ryo-Ohki, transform quickly and get us out of here!" Ryoko yelled and the 
little cabbit jumped into the air. She transformed and got everyone aboard. She 
then slipped out of sub-space and into the real world. 
	She made her way to each of the moons and deposited each to their spots 
near the reactor. Washu typed on her keyboard as she monitored everyones vitals. 
	"Alright listen up, we have six minutes left in the countdown so get 
moving and destroy the cores to the reactors, then run like hell," Washu 
explained and kept watch on the clock. It kept counting until it reached four 
and a half when Mihoshi radioed in.
	"Washu, I have the first reactor," she yelled as she ran. "Get me up on 
the ship!"
	"Ryo-Ohki?" Wahsu asked and the ship meowed. Mihoshi appeared on the deck 
and came behind Washu.
	"How is everyone?" she asked out of breath.	
	"Their alright, it seems we might accomplish this."	
	"Okay, so after we disable the reactors and his beam explodes, what about 
us?"
	"We slip back into sub-space and have a party, thats what."
	"Ryoko here, I have this reactor shut down, get me back up please," Ryoko 
said over her radio. She soon appeared on the deck and looked around.
	"Whats the time Washu?" she asked and Washu coughed a little bit.
	"Two minutes."
	'Come on Ayeka, Tenchi,' she thought to herself and then looked outside 
the window. "Look." Outside the window the large beam Atmos grew could be seen 
from over the horizon. Everyone but Washu flocked to the window to see the blue 
sparks and glow from of the horizon.
	"One and a half," Washu said and Ayeka radioed in.
	"Washu, I have the reactor down, I'm ready." Ayeka appeared on deck and 
looked around as Ryoko had done but she had something else on her mind.
	"Where is Tenchi?"
	"He hasn't radioed in yet," Ryoko explained.
	"One minute," Washu said and a faint radio signal came over the speakers.
	"Tenchi . . . fight . . . Isht . . . monster . . . can't . . . try 
. . . destroy . . . core . . . time," Tenchi said as static interfered.
	"Tenchi you have one minute, please hurry!" Washu said.
	"Monster . . . Ishtar . . . here . . . try . . . destroy . . . him 
. . . core."
	"The monster from Ishtar is there!" Ryoko yelled.
	"Tenchi destroy that reactor now and get out of there!" Washu yelled into 
the microphone until a small beeping came into everyones ears. Washu went limp 
and Tenchi came over the radio.
	"Washu, I'm here, the monster from Ishtar migrated over here and attempted 
to stop me but I destroyed it. Was I in time."
	"Time is up Tenchi, you didn't make it."
	"Shit! Beam me up now!" Tenchi yelled frustrated. 
	He appeared on the deck as Washu threw the transmitter on the ground and 
ran to the window. Tenchi ran to it also as the glowing on the horizon of Hades 
grew brighter and brighter. Soon the giant Atmos had created, appeared and the 
giant ball of energy could be seen in his hands. 
	"Miss Washu, It's Atmos!" Sasami yelled as they wittnessed Atmos morph 
into the giant stone creature and bring it back to life. He then laughed 
defiently and began to shake violently. A blue field of energy sent shockwaves 
outward. The ball of energy crackled and popped with the amount of pure energy 
encircling it. Atmos' laugh grew louder as he pulled his hands back further then 
threw them forward. The ball turned to a beam and headed out of the atmosphere 
of Hades and toward the planet of Jurai.
	"Washu, what now?" Ryoko asked panicking.
	"I don't know, I don't know!" she yelled and banged her hand on the 
railing aroung the window.
	"This is it, isn't it? Jurai's long awaited fate," Ayeka said and fell to 
her knees. Tenchi put his head against the glass of the window and Washu moved 
away and to her computer. She typed a few things in and turned toward the 
others.
	"We have two hours until that beam hits Jurai, and we have that much time 
to make a decision, we either let it hit Jurai and go home, we stop it from 
hitting by letting the beam hit us, or we pull Jurai away somehow. Those are our 
options, take them or leave them," Washu explained and stared at everyone on the 
deck.

	Next Chapter: Sorry this is one of those cliffhangers where I gotta ask 
questions such as, will I let Jurai be destroyed? (Never liked the place come to 
think of it.) Or will I spare it and have someone come up with a brilliant idea? 
Either way, don't miss the next chapter:
