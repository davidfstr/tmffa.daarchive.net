    "Lighthawk wings," Jason shouted as he began to drop. When he hit the 
floor dust flew
everywhere but when the dust settled Jason was shining bright with the power 
of the lighthawk
wings. He charged forward and jumped slightly in the air slashing down 
across Tokimi's cheast.
The wound gaped open and a thick black cloud spewed out from her cheast. The 
body fell into
Jason's arms. "Joey...." he whispered. The girl glanced up at him.

    "Jason?"

    Jason smiled, "I did it Joey I beat her."

    Jason turned to Tsunami but the goddess wasn't smiling. "It's not over 
yet." The thick black
cloud was forming into the astral body of Tokimi. Suddenly the goddess' dark 
purple eyes sprung
open. Instantly the floor of the room cracked and sent Jason sliding along 
the snapped flow down
towards who knows what. Suddenly his body shone with a shimering silver 
light as his bright
Angelic wings shone into few and appeared in full glory. The half Angel flew 
into the air to see
Tsunami and Tokimi again exchanging blows of energy. Jason dropped to a 
large piece of floor
that had hardly slipped at all and made a defence position. Creating an 
energy blast he fired
his energy towardsTokimi and attacked with his full power. No effect.

   "You think you can defeat me when I was the one who created you? How 
pityfull." Tokimi laughed
brushing off Jason's attack.

   Tsunami turned to the Angel while firing her attack and frowned. "Get out 
of here Jason there's
no point you trying you'll just get killed."

   Jason thought for a moment and reluctently agreed. Jason burst into a run 
across the falling
piece of floor. He jumped from it to another falling chunk and continued to 
do this towards the
doorway. He was almost there when he was cut off by a dark figure. The 
figure was like a dark
shadow but as he opened his eyes Jason saw they were bright yellow. 
"You're.... a werewolf."

   "Wow I'm suprised you've got that amount of brain power. After all you 
did get yourself
involved in this meaningless battle. Now for your ignorence you will die," 
the figure spoke.

   Jason store into his haunting yellow eyes which resembled Ryoko's and 
laughed, "bring it on."

   The two stood ready to fight when the figure asked, "what is your name?"

   "Huh?" Jason questioned.

   The figure smiled, "I must always know the name of my victems or else I 
would be a mindless
killer. My name is Feng Taianni"

   "My name..... is Jason."




   Tenchi, Ryoko and Ayeka ran through the halls towards where the noise. As 
they reached close
towards the battle ground there was a huge smashing sound and Jason was sent 
flying crashing
through the hall and then through the second wall Feng Taianni chased after 
as a deep brown
werewolf who howled viciously. He dove through the hole created by the young 
half Angel howling
fiercely.

   "We've got to help," Ryoko shouted running towards the hole.

   "I agree," said Ayeka following. Tenchi soon ran after the two of them.

   "Stop right there," came a voice. As the three ran forward they halted 
seeing a ghostly figure
standing in front of them. His long green hair and emerald eyes shining 
brightly.

   Tenchi took a step forward, "get out of the way."

   "No young Juraian. You will have to face me to get to Tokimi."

   Tenchi charged forward spinning tenchi-ken across the figures face. The 
figure laughed as the
sword went straight through him. Tenchi stood in amazement as the figure 
uppercutted him. "Ayeka
we've got to do something." Ayeka nodded and the two ran forward only to be 
stopped an invisible
shield.

   "What is this?" Ayeka asked rubbing her head.

   The Death Knight smiled as he slammed Tenchi into the wall, "just 
something to stop you two
interfering. now you'll get to watch me kill your beloved Tenchi."

   "DON'T YOU DARE HURT TENCHI," Ryoko screamed slamming her fist into the 
barrier.

   Ayeka tried an attack aswell but neither seemed to have any effect. Ayeka 
fell into the
barrier and slid to the floor in tears. "Take me, I'm a Juraian Princess you 
can hold me ransom
anything just don't hurt Tenchi."

   The two screamed and cried out as the Death Knight kicked Tenchi across 
the floor.




   Jason lay on the floor as Feng delivered a kick to his ribs. "Haven't had 
enough?" he taunted
as the Angel reached his feet. A knee to the ribs and double spinning kick 
soon took him back as
Feng's right leg followed his left leg. Jason hit the floor and yelled in 
pain as he felt his
back crack. Slowly stumbling to his feet he felt a kick smash into his ribs 
followed by an
uppercut. Jason span in mid air as time seemed to slow. As he hit the floor 
he let a low scream
of pain come from his lips. "So will you give up or do I have to continue."

    "N......" he manged before writhing in agony on the floor. Feng stomped 
on his cheast.

    "What was that?" he smirked pushing down on the young half Angel's 
cheast.

    He screamed out in agony, "NO!"

    "Well then I'll just have to make you give up," the werewolf frowned as 
he kicked Jason
across the room.

    Jason crashed into the wall and fell forward to the floor. *I can't 
carry on, it's all over
Tokimi will win and the universe will be doomed.*

    *Don't give up* a voice echoed in his mind.

    Jason still did not move, *what are you? Who are you?*

    *I'm your mother*

    The voice suddenly seemed recognisable. *Washu?*

    *Yes I created you. But as with Ryoko I used my egg cell so I'm more 
like your mother. As I
used mass for Ryoko I used a diffrent creation method for you. That is why I 
was able to make
you a half Angel.*

    *I can't carry on much longer*

    *You can. You're much stronger than you think*

    Jason slowly began to stand up. *Wasn't that Tokimi's influence*

    *No. That was your true power Jason. The power inside of you*

    Jason rose to his feet and held out his hands. "Lighthawk Wings," he 
shouted as three bright
purple wings sprung from his back and as he stepped through them he stood in 
small silver armour
cheast plate and shoulder pads along with leggings made of the same 
material. Both were
incredibly light and resembled Juraian armour. As he stalked towards Feng 
the werewolf smiled.

    "I already knew about your wings Angel and Tokimi prepared me for you. 
You can't win Jason
not even with your precious lighthawk wings," Feng taunted.

    Jason store hard into Fengs' eyes. "Surrender now. Or you will be 
destroyed."

    "I will never surrender. Even faced with death you will never here we 
quit," Feng spoke
defiently.

    Jason still remained calm and frowned at Feng, "then it shall be your 
death. Ultima level."

    Feng smiled as Jason's body turned a bright purple colour and his wings 
spread out. "So you
aren't the small problem Tokimi described you as."

    "I am more of a problem than you think," Jason smiled as he created an 
energy sword. Feng
charged at Jason and flung his arms at the halg Angel. Jason ducked and 
delivered an axe kick to
his face. Following it he delivered a cresnt kick across Feng's face and 
dragged his leg back
across. Following that he kept his foot in the air and kicked Feng several 
times. As he dropped
his foot he charged forward span his sword through Feng's body and span in 
mid air to turn and
deliver a finishing blow across the back of Feng. As the werewolf fell 
forwards to the floor
Jason turned and walked out of the room shining with a raident white glow.




    Tenchi sliced the tenchi-ken through the Death Knight only to find 
nothing happened. The
ghostly warrior punched Tenchi across the face knocking him to the floor. 
"Tenchi," Ryoko shouted
as Ayeka held her face in her hands. "We've got to do something we can't 
just stay here."

    Ayeka looked up with tears in her eyes, "what can we do?"

    "We've got to focus on a certain point to break the field,"

    Ayeka looked up from the floor and wiped her eyes, "where?"

    Ryoko held her hand to a certain point to the middle of the shield. 
"Right there."

    Ayeka got to her feet. "On the count of three. One, two three," they 
counted together. Ryoko
created an energy sword and Ayeka powered up and dove pushed her hand 
forward into the shield
just next to Ryoko's energy sword. Soon the shield shattered and fell to the 
ground and Ryoko and
Ayeka charged forward at the Death Knight. Both of them attacked at the same 
time but none of
their attacks seemed to work. The Death Knight cooly back handed Ryoko 
across the room and turned
to Ayeka.

   "So you think you can take me then? I've defeated your friends and they 
are much stronger than
you," the Death Knight laughed.

   Ayeka turned her head to the floor then glanced back at him, "you wont 
win."

   "How can you stop me?" He laguhed as he held up a green energy sword. 
Ayeka charged forward
but was knocked backwards by a spin kick. As she lay in the corner she 
looked up and saw the
Death Knight looming over her. Suddenly he stopped in his tracks and fell to 
the floor. Ayeka
watched as the ghostly figure disappeared. Turning back her view she saw a 
teenage girl with
blonde hair with blue highlights staring back. The girl leant down next to 
Ayeka and smiled.

   "Are you okay Princess Ayeka?" the girl asked with a smile. Ayeka didn't 
answer as her vision
blured and she lost conciousness.




   Kiyone fired several blasts through the corridor eliminating several dark 
soldiers as she
charged through the hall with her wepon. Mihoshi followed firing several 
blasts, taking out
several enemies accidentaly. As they ran through they met up with the 
invasion specialists.

   "Squadren Alpha what do you report," the leader spoke. There were five 
troops but apart from
size there was no way of telling them apart as they wore helmets which 
covered their faces.

   Kiyone took a step forward, "section one is clear but section two has 
been a major problem."

   "Do not worry we will take care of it," the leader spoke.

   The team moved forward except for the leader of the group who was a 
little shorter than the
others. As the team left the leader took her helemet off and let down her 
long silver hair.
"Amber," Kiyone smiled.

   The two hugged one another and smiled. "I missed you sis," Amber cried.

   "How's everyone back at home?" Kiyone asked stepping back.

   "Their fine," Amber sighed, "it's not the same without you though."

   "I was thinking of coming back," Kiyone stated turning to Mihoshi.

   Amber also looked at the confused Police Detective. "Who might you be?" 
she asked smiling.

   "This is Mihoshi," Kiyone introdued. "Mihoshi meet Amber, my sister," she 
smiled.

   Mihoshi reached her hand out to shake hands with Amber but slipped and 
fell to the floor face
first. Both Kiyone and Amber gently laughed as they helped a tearfull 
Mihoshi to her feet. "Well
I've got to go we are in the middle of a war you know. When you want to both 
you and Mihoshi
just come home and stay with us for as long as you like."

   "I'd love that," Kiyone smiled.

   Amber nodded, "I've got to go, see you later." The young soldier smiled 
placing her helmet
back on and loading up her wepon.

   "Goodbye Miss. Amber," Mihoshi shouted as Amber ran off down the hallway.

   Kiyone turned to Mihoshi, "well we've got our job to do." With those 
words the two of them
ran down the hallway in the opposite direction Amber ran.




   Her eyes opened again to see a smiling Jason. "Hey sleepy nice to see 
you've woken up."

   "What happened?" Ayeka questioned sitting up an rubbing her head.

   Jason smiled helping her to her feet. "You saved the day Ayeka, you 
killed whoever you guys
were fighting."

   The Juraian Princess thought a moment then sighed, "I didn't it was 
someone.... someone else."

   "We've got to go help Tsunami," Tenchi shouted still recovering.

   Jason nodded as he stood to his feet ignoring Ayeka's last comment. 
"You're right."

   All four of them ran through the doors into tokimi's chamber to see 
Tsunami being sent across
the room to the floor. Both Jason and Tenchi stood forward and held out 
their arms calling,
"lighthawk wings." The bright blue wings appeared from them and grabbed a 
hold of Tokimi binding
her together. The two of them stood focused together using the wings to hold 
Tokimi.

   "Tsunami do something they cant hold on much longer?" Ryoko shouted 
seeing Jason waver.

   Tsunami looked up at the ex-space pirate. "You must help. Both of you 
need to create the
lighthawk wings.

   Both Ayeka and Ryoko turned to Tsunami, "Tsunami have you lost it we 
cannot create the wings
of the lighthawk."

   "You must," Tsunami stated standing to her feet. "If Jason could create 
them so can you two
you've just got to believe in yourself."

   Ayeka looked over to Ryoko and smiled, "do you think we can?"

   "Of course we can, I mean they can. How hard can it be?" Ryoko joked.

   The two of them joined Tenchi and Jason's side and smiled. Jason and 
Tenchi turned and looked
at them but didn't say anything. As the two of them held up there hands 
there was a blinding blue
light as Ayeka and Ryoko created the lighthawk wings. Together the four 
pairs of upper wings
wrapped around Tokimi binding her in a bright blue light. Together they 
squeezed in on Tokimi
untill she was completley destroyed. Then the wings vanished and all four of 
them collapsed onto
the floor with fatigue.

   Tsunami smiled as she stood over them, "you did great, all of you. Now 
that the evil in the
universe has been destroyed I guess it's back to normal life....."




   Ryoko and Ayeka grasped hands and pushed against one another. Jason sat 
on the worktop watching
as this happened. "Another normal day," Tsunami sighed as Ayeka and Ryoko 
powered up. Tenchi as
usual was in the middle through no fault of his own.

   "Tenchi is mine" Ryoko shouted slamming Ayeka into the wall.

   The Juraian Princess reversed it and slammed Ryoko into the wall, "how 
dare you say such a
thing you monster."

   Both Ayeka and Ryoko struggled about and soon they fellt to the floor 
trying to get an
advantage over the other. Jason smiled and gently laughed to himself, "cat 
fight." Mihoshi being
as lapless as she was ran in to split them up but soon got involved in the 
fight.

   "Please stop it both of you," Mihoshi cried as she tried to pull them 
apart.

   "Well if you can call this normal then yes it is a normal day then," 
Washu whispered as she
appeared next to Tsunami.

   Tsunami smiled at the red haired genius, "I don't think I can remember 
what is a normal life."

   "I don't want to live a normal life," Washu smiled as Jason waved at her. 
"I've got all my
family all my friends. This is our home now."

   "Sister...?" Tsunami turned to Washu.

   Washu smiled as she store into her sisters eyes, "what is it?"

   "Are you really Jason's mother?" Tsunami asked her sister.

   Washu smiled, "yes. Tokimi stole him from me when he was very young and 
had been training him
for the purpose of being her ultimate soldier. When she came to relise we 
were here she sent her
ultimate soldier to kill us off. Jason though came through for us now we're 
all together
forever."

   "I still don't understand about his past. All those people he told me 
about, his sister, his
friends they all seemed to have just disappeared," Tsunami sighed. "It's 
strange because I am
aware of everything and yet I do not understand that."

   Washu shrugged, "I feel the same. My guess is that it was Tokimi creating 
a fake life for
Jason so he didn't rebel or relise what he was."

   "Poor Jason he's gone through so much. We all have." Tsunami sighed.

   Washu smiled up at her sister, "yes but it's all alright now. It's all 
alright."

Outro (or whatever is the opposite of the intro) :

Yakuza : Is it? Is it the end? I wanna know please tell me.

Kiyone : What are you blibbering about

Yakuza : well I don't know if it's the end or not do I. I only write these 
fan fics I don't know
what I write

Kiyone : You know shutting up would be a good idea right about now.

Yakuza : yeaa... I think I will shut up and write a dodgy authours note 
about how everyone should
e-mail me or else i'll stop the fan fic which is a load of rubbish but gets 
me a few more fan
e-mails.

Authour notes : well I'll probabley start yet another continuation. Have you 
ever noticed how my
sagas seem incredibly short, dim witted, not thought through and explained 
in little details.
