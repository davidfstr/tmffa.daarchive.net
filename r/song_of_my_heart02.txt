Song of My Heart: Falling Blossoms, and Confessions

Hotsuma lie in Washu's lab uncontios,  from Ryoko's hit.  Ryoko sat in a cherry 
blossom tree thinking of what she had done last night, how she had gone after 
Hotsuma.
"Why did I do that?  I love Tenchi! atleast that's what I keep telling 
myself....." she sighed and jumped out of the tree, and watched a few cherry 
blossoms fall.  "Now I know how Tenchi feels..." she said as she walked back to 
the house.
"Hi Ryoko, you missed breakfast, are you alright?" sasami ask, her voice full of 
worry.
"Huh? oh.... yea... I'm fine." she said quietly as she walked into Washu's lab, 
and into it's medical bay.

 {why do I love him?  he betrayed me and yet..... I feel connected to him....} 
Ryoko thought as she sat down next to the bed Hotsuma was on. {may.. maybe I hit 
him to hard with that rock... oh God I hope not, I didn't want to hurt him.....}
Just then Hotsuma moved in his sleep.
"Oh God he's wakeing up1 I hafta hide.." Ryoko whispered, then jumped behind a 
machine.
"What the hell happened to me?" she heard Hotsuma's say groggily.
"Ah, so sleeping beauty finally woke up!" she heard Washu's somewhat nasal voice 
say. She had to stifle a laugh from Washu's comment. She took this moment to get 
away.

A few hours after the lab inncident, Ryoko sat on the couch reading a girls 
manga.
"Hah.... talk about love sick... some of these girls have the dumbest ways to 
find love...." she laughed at the thought of someone trying to hyonotize a man 
into loveing her. "everyone knows hypnotizem is fake.. it doesn't work..."
"Watcha readin?" came Mihoshi's bubbly voice.
"Huh? oh just a manga..."
"Wow! can I see?!?!"
"Maybe later..."
"B.. but Space Police Police Men is on later!!"
"MIHOSHI!!" came Kiyone's voice from outside. "We're already late for work! Come 
on!!"
"Oh sorry Ryoko... I hafta go, see ya later! bye!" said Mihoshi happily as she 
walked outside to join Kiyone.
"hm? yea bye.." Ryoko said, consumed in the manga once again.
Washu seemed to apear out of nowhere, ripped the manga out of Ryoko's hands, and 
started to yell at her "Why were you in my lab today watching Hotsuma? you went 
after him last night to... whats with you?" 
"I.. I.."  Ryoko stuttered.
"I want answers!"
"um.. I think I..."
"SPIT IT OUT!"
"I think I love him......"
