Second Chances


Prologue: Ohaiyo!



     Today, unlike other days, held a still morning calm.  Tenchi
turned over in his bed, and absently wiped a stray trickle of saliva
away from the corner of his mouth, before pulling a night-chilled
limb back under the covers.  Lazily relaxing, he yawned and stretched
in his bed, and snuggled himself deeper into the warmth of his
comforter.  Suddenly, a faint 'whoosh' of air announced the usual
unexpected visitor.  Or so he thought.

     He decided to pretend he was still asleep.  After all, it had
worked at least once before.  Maybe she’d just leave him alone so he
could get some more sleep.  Yet he soon felt the edge of his bed
depress from the weight of another.  So that's how it was going to be
this time.  His nerves danced with tingling anxiety, but he resolved
to stay still to see how it would play out.

     A gentle hand reached out and delicately ran along the length
of his body.  Tenchi kept his eyes shut, envisioning the graceful
girl beyond, all sinuous curves and bountiful charms.  Inwardly,
he giggled in nervous anticipation.  Outwardly, certain southern
elements were slowly rising to the occasion.

     Tenchi could hear her getting closer to him, leaning down toward
his face, and he chanced a tiny, unfocused peek through his eyelashes.
He caught a sliver of a glimpse of silvery pale hair, and a green
dress?  Well, she must have gotten something new just for him.  His
excitement increased to near-nosebleed levels.

     He could feel her hot breath against his cheek, peering close.
Perhaps she was wondering if he was still asleep.  Tenchi secretly
smiled to himself without revealing the slightest possibility
that he was still awake.  This time, he vowed, he would surprise
her instead of the other way around.

     Suddenly, without warning, Tenchi threw off his bedcovers and
embraced the figure on his bed, pushing her down against the springy
mattress.  He pulled her close in a rush and tangle of warm limbs,
feeling her graceful curves against his body.

     “Ha!  Surprise!”

     Tenchi opened his eyes.  A pair of crimson-in-yellow
pupils turned their startled attention toward him over an elegant
set of darkened lenses.  The tiny glasses caught a hint of Tenchi’s
reflection.

     "Good morning, Tenchi," a deep, sultry voice stated with an
exceptionally sharp smile.

     Tenchi's screams could be heard for miles.



     This was going to be a long morning.
