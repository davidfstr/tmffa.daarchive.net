	Mihoshi had always been a phenomenally lucky person.  Her birth 
had been lucky, as she was family of the Marshal of the Galaxy Police, 
which had helped her get out of situations many had been reprimanded 
for.  She had an uncanny knack for stumbling upon clues and 
accidentally happening upon criminal hideouts.  She had received a 
grand total of zero wounds in the field, an almost unprecedented 
number.  She was no marksman, but when she hit things, it was almost 
always a vital shot, knocking out an engine or disabling a limb.  And 
the universe be damned if her luck was suddenly going to give out on 
her now.
	Three thousand years ago, in a nearby solar system, pirates had 
destroyed a merchant ship.  In the ship's subsequent explosion, a fuel 
cell the ship had been carrying was propelled at incredible speeds 
towards the solar system.  More specifically, towards the current point 
in space in the solar system the escape pod Mihoshi was in was located.
	So, the fuel cell had traveled unmolested through thousands of 
hundreds of thousands of miles of space.  And now its journey was going 
to end abruptly, bringing to a halt its unknown bid for the record of 
"Longest Distance Floating Through Space Without Being Sucked Into a 
Star".
	There was a loud clunk as the fuel cell slammed into the side of 
the escape pod.  Well, there would have been a loud clunk except for 
the fact that sound waves needed matter to travel through, and space 
has none.
	The fuel cell, while being of impeccable quality, had been pretty 
badly damaged in the explosion.  Specifically, there was an area where 
the casing had been almost completely worn through, to the point where 
a pencil lead could have punctured it.  Naturally, the spinning fuel 
cell, when it impacted the escape pod, hit the one sharp, jutting 
corner of metal that had been missed in the last inspection of 
Yukinojo.  It would have been smoothed over immediately, and classified 
as a "prevented safety hazard", netting the inspector another twelve 
Jurai he could have spent on alcohol.  Which was the reason he missed 
the spot in the first place.
	When the fuel cell impacted the stray corner of the escape pod, 
the worn portion of the casing was immediately penetrated.  It was a 
small hole, but one through which the pressurized contents of the cell 
easily escaped.  
	This might not have been a problem, except for the fact that the 
cell was traveling through a stream of ionized particles left behind by 
Yukinojo's thrusters.  The highly volatile fuel immediately reacted 
with the ionized particles from the engine wash, and the result was 
this:
	An explosion.
	
	Of course, whatever luck the universe had planned for Mihoshi 
would most likely be unnoticed by the two guardians.  This is because 
Azaka and Kamidake were fighting.  They couldn't maneuver themselves 
very well in the cramped conditions of the escape pod, but they could 
definitely hurl verbal taunts at each other.  So they stood, slightly 
angled to provide room for Mihoshi, each one staring at the other with 
the lens that functioned as its sole "eye", their considerable masses 
no more than three inches away from each other.
	"Dammit, Kamidake, we could have taken him!"
	"But if Mihoshi had gotten hurt, then Sasami would be mad at us."
	"We both know that Mihoshi wouldn't have been hurt."
	"We couldn't be sure about that."
	"I think we were sure enough."
	"You would."
	"What does that mean?"
	"Oh, I'm sorry, Azaka.  I guess you must have forgotten the 
incident on Calumni?"
	"That was not my fault!"
	"Oh, yes, your reckless risk-taking had nothing to do with it."
	"Ah, yes, and I guess your extreme caution had nothing to do with 
the incident on Pelluci?"
	"I hardly think that is relevant."
	"Oh, and Calumni was?"
	"Are you trying to start something?"
	"I think we already have."
	"When we get out of here, you are mine, Azaka."
	"I dare you to do something, Kamidake."
	"I'd like to see you say that when we get out of here."
	The two guardians were about to come to blows as tensions past 
bubbled to the surface of this new conflict.  And they very well might 
have if at that moment, the subtle chain of cause and effect set off by 
the fuel cell hadn't resulted in a massive explosion that engulfed the 
escape pod they were in.	

	"DAMMIT!"  Jerome swore rather loudly, this time directing his 
anger at a rather annoying cable that had worked its way loose from the 
main mass of wiring and given him a rather unpleasant shock.
	"Was it that same wire?" asked Yukinojo, who was hovering behind 
Jerome where he was working underneath the main console, continuing to 
unsuccessfully hotwire the ship's navigational systems so they would 
bypass the AI safety interlocks.
	"Yes," muttered Jerome.  "Dammit, is there a spanner around here 
somewhere?"
	"It's over there," replied Yukinojo, who indicated a small panel 
off to the side of the ship by illuminating all of the lights around 
it.
	"Thanks," said Jerome as he crawled over to the panel and opened 
it, rummaging through the tools inside.  "You know, this would go a lot 
faster if you would just give me control of the ship."
	"I believe I told you that the security interlocks prevent me 
from turning over authorization of the ship without the consent of the 
owner or a ranking GP officer."
	"Yes, several times," muttered Jerome as he rooted through the 
contents of the side compartment.  "Is that a teddy bear?" he asked 
when he felt something soft and furry.
	"Yes," said Yukinojo.
	"Is that an action figure?"
	"Yes."
	"Is it a Space Police Policeman Action Figure™?"
	"Yes."
	"With Rocket Launcher Accessory™?" 
	"Yes."
	"And Real Karate Chop Action™?"
	"Yes."
	"And Hyperspace Police Cycle™?"
	"Yes."
	"And a Citadel of Evil Playset™?"
	"Yes."
	Jerome paused for a second.  "Cooooool."
	"So, have you found the spanner yet?"
	"Hold on...I'm going to put together the Citadel of Evil 
Playset™."
	"A new dumbass airhead acquired," Yukinojo commented quietly to 
himself, quickly changing his opinion of the new captain.
	"What?" asked Jerome.
	"I said, 'All new.  Some assembly required.'"
	"Oh, okay," said Jerome.
	Yukinojo sighed.  It looked like this might be a long hijacking.

	The escape pod flew away from where it had been engulfed by the 
explosion's brief flame.  There was an ear-splitting screech as metal 
plates rubbed against each other, trying to escape from their seating.  
And then there was a final screeching sound as they did, opening a hole 
in the escape pod.  And then there was the whistle as the small amount 
of air in the compartment escaped through that and many other holes.  
They widened as the quickly departing air demanded more room through 
which to escape its confinement.  The pod began ripping itself apart as 
shifting metal ruptured fuel lines.  These fuel lines were almost 
instantly ignited as the metal, still blazing hot from the explosion 
moments earlier, penetrated the lines' insulating material.
	To one watching the vessel from space, it would have looked like 
there was a brief moment of calm.  One would think the damage was done, 
figuring the escape pod was destined to float through space forever as 
a hunk of empty wreckage.
	One would have been proven quite wrong moments later, when 
everything exploded, sending shards of metal flying at high velocity in 
random directions.  There was a brilliant fireball which immediately 
flared out of existence as it consumed all of the oxygen it could in 
order to prolong its brief life.  As the flame died down, all that was 
left was the two guardians and a glowing sphere inside of which was a 
prone Mihoshi.
	"Well, that was sudden," said Azaka.
	"Indeed it was," replied Kamidake.  "We're going to need to get 
Mihoshi somewhere where she can get oxygen."
	"Where?  We only have limited ion propulsion.  We can't get to a 
planet in time."
	"I'm well aware of that.  Can we contact--" Kamidake was cut off 
as he bumped into something.  Something large.  And metal.
	"THE SHIP!" the two guardians exclaimed at once, realizing that 
although Jerome had left with Yukinojo, he had been forced to leave his 
own ship behind.
	In the hasty escape Jerome had made with Yukinojo, he had either 
forgotten or neglected to destroy his ship.  And now, his ship was 
conveniently going to provide Azaka, Kamidake, and Mihoshi with a ride.
	It was a fairly simple matter reaching the main hatch; the 
docking tube had automatically retreated inside the ship when Yukinojo 
detached from it.  However, there was now a new bit of trouble.  There 
didn't seem to be any way to enter without inputting an access code.  
And Azaka and Kamidake, as well made as they were, were designed with 
defense in mind, so force wasn't an option.
	"Umm...maybe he wrote it down somewhere?" ventured Kamidake.
	"Where?  On the side of the damn ship?!" Azaka yelled.
	"Perhaps we can guess the code?"
	"Yes.  And even if we do, how would we input it?  You recall how 
well that went with Yukinojo."
	"Well, this isn't exactly Yukinojo.  And, I think I might now how 
to do it now."
	"The hell you can..."
	Two arguments in one day.  The guardians were on a roll.

	Yukinojo sighed.  The cockpit had been so clean when he had 
finished his daily tidying.  And it hadn't even been messed up my 
Mihoshi at all!  And now...now, if Yukinojo could, he would have cried.
	Toys were everywhere.  Panels were randomly torn out with wires 
splayed across them, action figures and plushies were all over the 
floor, and Jerome had somehow managed to get gum on the ceiling!  There 
wasn't even any gum on the ship, particularly after Mihoshi had--well, 
Yukinojo couldn't remember because he had arranged for someone to 
delete the incident from his memory.  But he was sure there wasn't any 
gum on the ship!  And Jerome hadn't been chewing any when he came 
aboard the ship!  So how the hell had the ceiling ended up with gum on 
it?  How?
	"Okay, um, I'm looking at a blue wire and a red wire here!  Which 
one should I cross with this green one?" asked Jerome in his annoying 
voice.  Yukinojo had found it somewhat pleasant at first, the slight 
accent providing a bit of change from the norm.  Now it was annoying, a 
veritable parade of pain playing through his electronic ears.
	"I don't know!" snapped Yukinojo.
	"Okay, I'll just try them both!"
	Yukinojo muttered, a habit he had developed while dealing with 
Mihoshi.  It was a rare foible for an artificial intelligence to 
develop, and Yukinojo had it down to an art.  Like twitching.  He was 
also pretty good at that.
	He had had a lot of time to perfect his twitch now that Jerome 
had gone from trying to bypass the security interlocks (at which he had 
done a commendable job) to directly wiring the engine to the main 
console.  Of course, to do so, he had to rip the main command console 
out of its seating in the cockpit.
	Yukinojo sighed again.  Another thing he was good at that most 
artificial intelligences weren't.  His "eyes" moved around the cockpit, 
surveying the damage.  Again, he had the urge to cry.  For several 
moments he considered trying to get tear ducts installed so he could.  
He quickly dismissed the idea, however.  He was bordering on the edge 
of lunacy already, and that would surely have him decommissioned into 
something undesirable, maybe even a--he shuddered briefly--mechanical 
voice that says "Have a nice day."
	Yukinojo thought about Jerome again and became annoyed.  Why was 
he asking about different colored wires?  I mean, sure he knew what the 
green wire did and what the red wire did and what the blue wire did, 
but why was Jerome asking?  That's what the fricking manual was for!  
It should clearly say that the green wire should not be crossed with 
the blue wire...
	"Oh dear," said Yukinojo.
	"Kabloom!" said the explosion.  A cloud of black smoke shot out 
of the engine room Jerome in which Jerome was working, staining the 
walls with soot.  That would be a bitch to get cleaned.  Maybe, if 
there was justice in the world, the explosion had ended this ill-fated 
hijacking.
	"Don't worry, I'm okay!" hollered Jerome.
	"Dammit," Yukinojo muttered.
	"I think I might have broken something, and it's leaking some 
sort of caustic substance all over the--Oh, crap.  Do you have some 
paper towels or something?"
	At that moment, Yukinojo knew what he had to do.  He made a vow 
to himself.  He said it aloud, to make sure it sounded as good as it 
did in his mind.  "I want to kill this moron."
	"What?" asked Jerome from the engine room.
	"I said, 'Is what you spilled the boron?'"
	"No, I think it's some sort of hydrogen-based acid...maybe.  OW!  
It doesn't feel good on the skin, I'll tell you that!"
	Mutter.

	"You're going to use your feet?" Azaka said in disbelief.
	"Yes, I am.  They have a much smaller surface area than anywhere 
else," the other guardian said as he maneuvered himself around in space 
so he could touch the keypad.
	"Alright, I guess it's the best plan we have.  Any ideas on the 
keycode?"
	"Um...well, I'm hoping to get lucky."
	"Okay, give it a shot."
	Kamidake slowly rotated, using his contained ion drives to 
position himself perfectly on the keypad.  Then he gave himself a 
little thrust...and crushed the keypad like aluminum.
	"Oops.  I may have given it a bit too much," Kamidake said.
	"What happened?" asked Azaka, whose view was obscured by Mihoshi. 
He was generating a force field around her, the only thing preventing 
all of the oxygen from escaping into space.
	"Um," Kamidake began, when he suddenly heard a distinct, female 
voice.
	"What are you doing here?"
	Analytical programs and sensors in Kamidake began working 
immediately to discover from where the new voice had come.  It wasn't 
so much a voice as it was a short burst transmission of radio waves, 
which was what facilitated communication in space.  Because, as 
everyone knows, sound waves need matter to travel through, which is why 
there is no sound in space.  Kamidake's sensors quickly determined that 
the ship was talking to him, and that it was using a focused wave 
transmission, which meant Azaka could not hear any of this.
	"I need a ride," Kamidake said back over the same frequency, 
immediately chastising himself for being so lame.
	"Sorry babe, you don't have the access code," came back the 
voice.
	"Please, we desperately need you.  Otherwise the woman over there 
will run out of air and die!" Kamidake urgently transmitted.
	"Hmmm...I'll do this for you, if you do something for me," 
returned the voice.
	"Whatever it is, I'll do it."
	"Love me."
	Kamidake paused.  He was, as were many other artificial 
intelligences, capable of feeling love.  However, because the evolved 
need to pass on his genes wasn't present, AI's rarely felt a strong 
desire to love or be loved.
	Kamidake looked at Mihoshi again.  "Okay.  I'll love you forever, 
if you let us into the ship."
	"Forever?" the voice echoed, then laughed.  "I only want a one-
night stand kind of thing.  We just interface, then we go our separate 
ways.  I'm not looking for some sort of commitment, honey."
	"Fine.  Whatever you want.  Just let us in."
	"Alright, baby.  I hope you're as good as you sound."
	The connection closed, and then the hatch opened, giving them 
access to the airlock.
	"Kamidake, I don't know what you did, but it worked!" Azaka 
congratulated.
	"Neither do I," Kamidake muttered to himself.  All he knew was 
that he suddenly felt very dirty.

	Jerome had finally gotten everything connected and working.  It 
had taken two more explosions and a brief mistake that had shorted out 
half of the ship and caused the coffee maker to start working overtime, 
making a nice batch of steaming hot carpet stain, but it was finally 
working.  Also, there had been at least three paint spills while Jerome 
had been trying to cover up the marks he had made on the walls.  Which 
had made it worse, because the paint he had found was at least three 
shades off.  And there were scuffmarks on the floors everywhere, thanks 
to the boots Jerome wore.
	"What are the coordinates for the Histur System, Yukinojo?" 
Jerome asked as he fiddled with some connections on the control panel.
	"They're one point nine nine seven," Yukinojo paused.  If he were 
to set the next coordinate just a little off, the ship would fly into a 
star.  It would end the existence of this idiot.  It would end his, as 
well, but that would mean he would never have to deal with Jerome or 
Mihoshi again.
	Yukinojo quickly shed the thought.  He wasn't that psychotic.  
Yet.  After another paint spill, though...
	"Hey, you trailed off after seven there!" Jerome called.
	"Sorry," apologized Yukinojo.  "Seven."
	"No that's where you stopped."
	"Yes, and then it's a seven."
	"No, the seven comes after the nine."
	"THE SEVEN IS AFTER THE SEVEN!  THE NUMBER IS ONE POINT NINE NINE 
SEVEN SEVEN!" Yukinojo yelled, silently adding a "moron" at the end.
	"Okay, I got it.  No need to yell," Jerome said as cheerily as 
ever.
	Yukinojo looked around the surrogate cockpit Jerome had set up in 
the engine room.  He was sitting up against the wall with the console 
he had cannibalized from the normal cockpit in his lap.  There were 
wires running from it to the engine, where it was directly hooked up to 
the main controls.  This bypassed the security circuits, allowing him 
to pilot the ship as opposed to floating aimlessly in space.
	And they had been aimlessly floating for a while.  Jerome had 
done a good job at stymieing the initial security protocols, but while 
he had one many battles, he had lost the war.  The engines had shut 
down, and now the ship was just floating.
	But, after long last, the engines were flaring to life and 
directing them to the Histur System, and nothing could stop them.  
Although that didn't stop Yukinojo from trying.
	There was a small toolbox, filled with lots of heavy painful 
tools, teetering over Jerome's head.  It was perfectly aligned, too.  
So Yukinojo did something to rectify the problem.  At least, the 
problem as he saw it.  He made the thrusters on the port side fire 
quickly, jostling everything on the ship.
	The toolbox fell towards Jerome's head.  And he didn't see it 
coming.

	"Wake up, Mihoshi.  Wake up."  This was the first thing Mihoshi 
heard as she returned to consciousness.  It was Kamidake's voice, 
telling her to wake up.  And she was graciously complying.
	"What happened?  Am I dead?"
	It was a fairly valid concern.  As near as Mihoshi's dazed mind 
could tell, she was floating in a black void.  The artificial gravity 
was off, and she was still nearly blind still from the brilliant 
explosion of which she had been at the epicenter.  So, as far as 
Mihoshi could tell, she was dead.  And Kamidake's deep, rich voice was 
close enough for Mihoshi to assume it was God's.  She wasn't in a 
moment of complete lucidity.
	"No, you're not dead.  This is Kamidake.  Azaka and I are here 
with you."
	"You and Azaka died?  This is all my fault!" Mihoshi wailed.
	"No, no," came Azaka's voice from her other side.  "We just took 
you to a better place."
	"You mean we've moved on?  We're all dead?" Mihoshi began 
sniffling, on the verge of tears.
	"Oops," said Azaka.  "Bad choice of words there."
	"Indeed," agreed Kamidake.  "Look, we're right here with you, 
Mihoshi.  Just open your eyes and look at the light."
	"The light?  I AM DEAD!" Mihoshi cried.  "And you are too, and 
it's all my fault.  If I had been faster or better or smarter we 
wouldn't be dead right now and you could go back to Ayeka and I could 
go back and have breakfast with Tenchi and we could--ACK!"
	Mihoshi sputtered and opened her eyes as she was sprayed by water 
from an old fire prevention system the ship had turned on.  "Just open 
your damn eyes, honey," said the ship's AI in its pleasantly feminine 
voice.
	"Are you God?" asked Mihoshi.
	"No, I'm Sakana.  Now get up and figure out where the hell you 
are."
	"I'm in hell?" Mihoshi asked.  "Oh, what did I do wrong?  I 
thought I was a good person!  I tried to help people!  I know that 
sometimes they ended up crying and threatening to kill me, but I wanted 
to help!"
	"You are NOT in hell," Sakana said firmly.  "You are not dead.  
You are in a space ship." 
	"Oh," said Mihoshi.  "Well, why is God talking to me?"
	"KAMIDAKE IS NOT GOD!" Sakana exclaimed.  "Although, now that I 
think about it, I hope he can work miracles in the sack..."
	"What?" said both Azaka and Mihoshi.
	"Oh, nothing.  Don't you two worry about it," Sakana said.
	"What happened to the escape pod?" Mihoshi asked.
	"It exploded," explained Azaka.
	"You were there, remember?  In the center?" said Kamidake.
	"A bright flash?" Azaka elaborated.  "Loud boom?"
	"I fear the girl may have had some brain trauma," Sakana said.
	Azaka and Kamidake looked at each other, then began chuckling.
"That's okay," said Azaka, "you just don't know Mihoshi."

	"OW!  OW OW!  DAMMIT OW!  SHARP!  OW!  HEAVY OW OW OW!"
	"Not even unconscious," Yukinojo muttered, as Jerome flailed and 
ducked underneath the barrage of heavy, oftentimes sharp, tools.  
Yukinojo watched the spectacle unfold, and began to regret the wisdom 
of his actions.  He would have to clean up this mess, after all.
	"Whew," said Jerome, standing up and brushing himself off, "that 
was close."
	"Yes, it certainly was.  We must have hit some sort of object," 
Yukinojo lied.
	"I knew there was an asteroid belt near our location, but I was 
unaware that we were so close already."
	"I believe it was just a random piece of debris.  If you come to 
the actual bridge, I can show you our current progress."  Yukinojo 
turned around and left the engine room, adding, "...if you didn't rip 
out that cord already," on his way out.
	Jerome moved forward, or at least tried to.  Then a strange look 
passed Jerome's face and his eyes turned downwards, to his feet.  He 
grunted audibly once, then reached down and grabbed his right leg, and 
began pulling.  When that leg refused to budge, he tried the other, 
somehow managing even less success.
	"How did this happen?" he asked himself, scratching his head.  
Jerome leaned back and sat, figuring he would be able to ponder this 
sudden occurrence just as well seated as standing.  And he immediately 
leapt up when something sharp and stabbing poked him in the rear.
	At least, he tried to leap.  It ended up being more of him 
throwing himself forward, rotating about the axis generated by his 
stuck feet.  He landed face first on the deck with a thud.
	"Ow," he said, propping himself up on his elbows.  His right hand 
instinctively went to his buttocks, looking for the sharp stabbing 
thing on which he had sat.  Finding it, he grimaced for a moment and 
pulled it out, then brought it in front of him.  It was a piece of 
glass.  And it had part of a label on it, too.  Jerome read aloud:
	"Industrial Strength Adhesive.  Warning: Do not let come in 
contact with skin or eyes.  If skin or eye contact occurs, dissolve 
with a solution of one half--" Jerome looked at the piece.  "One half 
what?  And what's the other half?" he asked frantically.
	Quickly, Jerome pulled himself up into a crouching position and 
began looking around for the rest of the label.  After sifting through 
several pieces of glass and getting quite a few cuts on his hands, 
Jerome still had no more answers.  And his ankles were starting to 
hurt.  
	Resigned, Jerome reached over to the command console he had set 
up so he could work on plotting the ship's course, or something equally 
unnecessary and menial.  As luck would have it, the impact had jarred 
the console just out of reach.
	"I really wish I hadn't taken off my shoes." Jerome said 
forlornly, casting a downward glance at his poor stuck feet.

	"Alright, that problem's solved," Azaka said with relief.
	The last ten minutes had been spent convincing Mihoshi that she 
was not dead, and that Yukinojo had been hijacked.  The second had been 
much easier than the first, but Mihoshi was even worse than usual.  The 
blow on the head had dizzied her to the point of mild retardation.
	"So, where is Yukinojo?" Mihoshi asked.  Azaka was strongly 
reconsidering his earlier statement about Mihoshi just being Mihoshi.
	"Yukinojo was hijacked," Kamidake explained.  Again.
	"What?  When did this happen?  We've got to find him!" Mihoshi 
exclaimed.
	"Can I hit her?" Azaka asked, advancing from the back of the 
terribly cramped ship.
	"No," Kamidake said, cutting off his approach.  "We've just got 
to help her regain her memory, because cheap tricks like bonking people 
on the head to fix their brains only work in--"
	Kamidake was interrupted by a loud, metallic "KAWANG".  This 
noise had come about thanks to the ship's computer, which had tired of 
this and figured she'd either fix Mihoshi's brain of knock her out, 
either of which would be an acceptable result to her.
	"--cartoons."
	"We need to find Yukinojo!" Mihoshi exclaimed.
	"If you had a foot, it would be in your mouth," Azaka said 
smugly.
	"I don't have a mouth, either," Kamidake muttered.  He turned to 
Mihoshi.  "How can we find Yukinojo?"
	"Well, I have my control cube," she said, reaching up to her hat 
to pull of a fluffy white ball that immediately took the form of a pink 
cube.  She began twisting the faces, like it was a pink lemonade Jell-o 
Rubik's cube.  The first twist changed her outfit into orange and 
purple combat armor.  The next twist caused her pistol to appear out of 
subspace and land on top of Azaka.  The next twist changed her clothes 
back to her normal GP uniform.  The next twist caused a beam of light 
to emanate from the cube, like a flashlight.  Except instead of being 
aimed in front of Mihoshi, it was aimed at her face.
	"Ack!" she exclaimed as she flipped over the back of the pilot's 
seat in an attempt to escape the sudden bright light.  She looked 
around sheepishly for a moment, then apologized.
	"Sorry."  Once she was reseated, she twisted it another time, and 
finally got the desired result.  A soft, feminine voice came out of the 
cube.
	"Thank you for accessing the GP handbook.  How may I assist you?" 
it asked.
	"Yes, could you tell me how to work the GP issue watch, model--" 
she paused to look at the numbers inscribed on it, "--10B Series?"
	"What is the desired function you wish to operate?"
	"That was a little redundant, wasn't it?" Kamidake whispered to 
Azaka.
	"Shut up," the voice politely said.
	"Excuse me?" Kamidake asked.
	"Can you explain the tracking systems?  Specifically for tracking 
a stolen Galaxy Police Cruiser?" Mihoshi asked before the help file 
could get in an argument with Kamidake.
	"Simply press the mode settings button until you are in 'distress 
tracking mode'.  Then your cruiser should be clearly displayed and 
labeled in the holographic display."
	"Thanks!"
	"Do you have any other queries?" the help file asked.
	"I do," Azaka interjected.  "Just where the hell do you get off 
telling my friend to shut up?"
	"Do you want a piece of this, fatass?" the help file asked, 
retaining its pleasant tone.
	"Who do you think you're calling fatass, you ignorant little help 
file?  I'd rather have a poorly translated instruction manual, myself," 
Azaka said smugly to Kamidake.
	"Perhaps you should remove the stick from your ass before you 
start to take its shape.  Oh, wait, too late!" the help file retorted.
	"What did you just say?" Azaka shot back, his voice on the verge 
of yelling.
	"I said you can take your crappy log-shaped BEEOOOOP."  The 
strange sound at the end was caused by Mihoshi twisting her control 
cube to deactivate the program.
	"Alright," she said to herself, ignoring the steamed guardians 
and concentrating on the watch, "I need to change it to distress 
tracking mode."
	Mihoshi pressed a button on the side of the watch a few times, 
then pressed a button on the face.  Three wide, concentric circles of 
varying colors popped up above it.  After a moment, they all rotated 
and tilted, displaying various red dots with characters near them.
	"Sakana, lay in a heading of one point nine nine two seven.  
That's where Yukinojo is."
	"Aye-aye, captain," Sakana said with a touch of sarcasm in her 
voice.  Engines flared and soon the humble crew was on their way to 
rescue Yukinojo.

	Yukinojo was, at the moment, in very little need of rescuing.  In 
fact, he was listening to the Dies Irae passage of Guiseppe Verdi's 
Requiem, effectively drowning out the pathetic pleas Jerome was making 
from the engine room.  It was another curiously humanlike trait he had 
developed.  Listening to music, not ignoring the cries of those in 
need.  Besides, the fool was just stuck to the floor by some adhesive.  
Yukinojo could bring him some solvent once they reached the planet.
	Right now, the AI was enjoying the peace the powerful choral 
piece brought him.  If he had arms, they would be making wild gestures 
like those of a conductor.  But spastic and reminiscent of a drug-
induced seizure.  Yukinojo had no artificial appendage control built 
into his intelligence, so he would be effectively unable to control 
them properly.
	However, he could control his body, a pink set of domes attached 
to tracks on the ceiling through a series of hinged arms.  And Yukinojo 
was controlling his body, pirouetting about the bridge to the music.  
He had been doing so since the beginning, starting with the first long 
choral note, through which he did a tight spin while moving up and down 
in a corresponding pattern with the brass notes playing in the 
background.
	With each powerful brass note, Yukinojo burst forward and like a 
striking snake and just as quickly retracted with each following beat 
of the bass drum.  For the next long choral note, he moved from one end 
of the track to which he was connected to the other, once again moving 
up and down in correspondence with the background notes.
	For the next series of notes, Yukinojo held his position through 
the brief initial note, then jerked up on his middle hinge to each 
burst of sound and returned to his original position on the bass drum 
note.
	He quickly pulled himself as close as possible to the ceiling, 
and slowly lowered himself with the choral note, slowly speeding his 
descent with the steps of the mounting crescendo.  When he was fully 
extended, he began rotating and sliding along the track to the series 
of four brief choral notes, the first of which was always accented by 
the full voices of the choir singing it.
	And at the end of the track, he came face to face with Jerome.
	"GAH!" he exclaimed, inches from Jerome's face.  He quickly 
regained his composure.  "What took you so long?"
	"I glued my feet to the floor," Jerome answered briskly.
	"What?" Yukinojo said, doing an excellent acting job.  "Wait, 
nevermind.  Just, how did you unglue yourself?"
	"I didn't.  Laser cutter."  Jerome pointed to his feet for 
emphasis.  And sure enough, attached to his feet were two large, fairly 
circular pieces of the floor.
	If Yukinojo had a heart, he would have had a heart attack.  But 
he didn't, so he just managed for a few moments of astounded silence 
while staring that Jerome's new shoes.  "I think," he paused for a 
second.  "I think I have some solvent that could work on that."
	"Cool!" Jerome said.  "How much longer until we reach our 
destination?"  He walked over to the command chair, his feet making 
annoying clomp sounds with every step.
	"I hate my life," Yukinojo said sadly.
	"What?"
	"I said 'We're late.  By nine.'"
	"Nine?" Jerome said, obviously confused.
	"Oh, right, you don't use Greenwich Mean Time.  About one hour," 
Yukinojo replied.  "New let me see if I can't find that solvent."
	As he left the bridge, Yukinojo muttered to himself, "I'm going 
to find the one that burns, too."

	Mihoshi's motionless form floated through the weightless cabin of 
the Sakana, asleep.  The ship was using its FTL drives in their search 
of Yukinojo, but it was still taking long enough for Mihoshi to take a 
nap.  Azaka and Kamidake had gone into a low-power mode.  Not to 
conserve energy, as their fusion reactors would last for a few more 
decades, but because there was little for them to do and it allowed 
them to conserve power in case of an emergency.
	They were all floating because Sakana was low on fuel, and could 
only make it if certain functions were deactivate.  So, after a bit of 
deliberation, artificial gravity, shields, and the stereo system were 
deactivated.  In that order.
	And thus, the inhabitants of the small one-man vessel were 
floating around, bumping into each other on a regular basis.  The only 
results of the collisions were a slight mutter and a brief movemont of 
arms, part of a comical attempt to roll over while half asleep in zero 
g.
	And so, it caused quite a stir when Sakana decided to wake the 
sleeping trio up by temporarily switching on artificial gravity.
	"OW!" came three startled voices, accompanying the thuds of their 
accompanying bodies hitting the deck.
	Azaka was the first one back on his feet.  Well, at least what 
counted as his feet.  "What was that for?" he asked.
	"I needed to wake you up."  If she could have, Sakana would have 
shrugged along with the comment.  "We've arrived."
	Mihoshi was first to the window.  "That's where Yukinojo is?"
	Azaka was second.  "Huh.  The planet looks familiar somehow."
	Kamidake was third.  "I concur."
	The comm. crackled with a burst of static, then sound greeted 
their ears.  "Welcome to Pelluci, please state your business."
	Both Azaka and Kamidake made a slight gagging noise, and if they 
could have, they would have blanched.  "Is something wrong?" Sakana 
asked.
	"The planet Pelluci is, thusfar, the only planet to have refused 
allegiance with the Juraian Empire," Kamidake said.
	"In no small part to our friend Kamidake here," Azaka added.
	"Quiet," Kamidake snapped at Azaka.  "Anyway, as such, it is a 
haven for smugglers, bounty hunters, and wanted criminals."
	"What's your point?" Sakana asked.
	"My point is, that there are any number of people here who would 
gladly take the opportunity to kill a Galaxy Police officer or any sign 
of the Juraian Empire."
	"What would they do to a Galaxy Police cruiser?" Mihoshi asked.
	"I don't want to know," Kamidake responded.
	"I really don't want to know."



Thanks to Geoduck for ID'ing the passage of Verdi's Requiem I was 
referring to in that one scene.  It's a great piece, and I recommend it 
for download wholeheartedly.  And additional music thanks to SC for 
helping me with the terminology.  Anything I got wrong is one hundred 
percent my fault, though.  SC knows her music.
