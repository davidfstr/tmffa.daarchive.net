For the Love of Tenchi: The Series After No Need For Zero
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Summer was over, leaves started to fall off the trees, a gentle 
wind rustled the fallen leaves on the ground, fall was starting.   
Sweaters and jackets were being advertized instead of summer dresses.  
Laughter of students, preparing for school, could be heard. While at the 
Masaki house, no laughter, no advertisements, only sadness was heard.
	"I made you your lunch for today Tenchi."
	"Domo, Sasami"
	"Are you sure you don't want me and Mihoshi to fly you to school 
by Yagami?"
	"Uh..hehe no that's ok"  <Tenchi eyed Mihoshi and Yagami 
nervously.  He walked out of the house, while everyone said their 
goodbyes.  Up ahead he could see Ryoko, smiling at him.>
	*Now you didn't think I would just let you leave with out saying 
any thing to me, did you?* <He smiled when she spoke to him in his mind.  
Since Washu told them that they had a mind bond, she would speak to him 
this way.>
	*I would be too afraid to face the wrath of Space Pirate Ryoko* 
<He then reached where she was.  She glomped on him, hugging tight.
	"I'm going to miss you so much.  I loath the long days you are not 
here with me."
	"School is over at 3, I'll be home by 3:30"
	"At least let me fly you there, please!?!?!"
	"All right." <Ryoko leaps in the air from joy.  She grabs onto 
Tenchi waist, and lifts off the ground>  *Hold on*  <Tenchi, used to 
flying with Ryoko, held onto her waist lightly and looked at Tokyo.  
From a bird's eye view the bustling city looked so peaceful and quiet.> 
*I love looking at Tokyo from up here.  One day I should take you over 
the mountains behind your house, they are so beautiful*
	*Not as beautiful as you*  <Tenchi could sense her blushing>
	*Don't distract me, I might drop you*  <He smiled.  Soon they 
reached Tenchi's school.  Ryoko landed on the ground behind the school, 
so no one would see her.  Tenchi remembered when Ryoko first came to his 
school, and blew it up.  He laughed>
	"That was funny..."  <Tenchi was startled for a second that she 
knew what he was thinking, until he remembered their link.>
	"This is where I depart,"
	"And I get lonely.."  <Her eyes stared into Tenchi's soul with a 
pleading look.>
	"Ryoko, It is hard for me too.  Do something to keep your mind off 
the time."  <Ryoko thought for a moment, and then smiled at him, 
devilishly.>
	*I will be waiting for you..*  <Tenchi reached in for a kiss.  
Ryoko embraced him with everlasting love, making sure she would remember 
the kiss throughout the day.  When they broke he looked at her one last 
time, before leaving for class.>
	"Itsukumishu!"
	"Itsukumishu nimo, Ten-chan"  <With a sigh, Ryoko hovered up to 
the sky.  She began to think about the summer.  She remembered how she 
was terrified when Ayeka took her back to her cave, bound and gagged.  
When Tenchi came to rescue her, Ayeka went crazy and threatened him.  
She remembered the anger in his eyes as he charged for Ayeka.  Sasami 
became scared and cried out to Tenchi to stop.  Tenchi walked over to 
her, and untied her.  She remembered Ayeka's face, shock and confusion.  
The same look was on her face, when she was sent back to Jurai to get 
over her mental problem, shock and confusion.  Since Ayeka left, things 
were quieter, no more fighting, no more screaming, no more..competition.  
Things became happier after a few weeks and started to get back to 
normal.  She totally forgot about school until he mentioned it a few 
days ago.  With a sigh, she continued on. Before she knew it, she was 
back at the Masaki house.  She could hear cries of delight from inside 
the house.  Out of curiosity, and boredom, she flew down and transported 
into the house.>
	"Success, again!"  <Ryoko, laughing inside, wonder what "the 
greatest scientist of the universe" invented this time.>  "Well, my 
"little Ryoko" if you are that curious I will tell you..but on one 
circumstance..."
	<Ryoko, like Tenchi, forgot about her link with Washu.  But when 
Washu said "circumstance"..she knew something was coming....>  
"Please...Mom!?!?!"
	<Washu, lighting up, like a new lightbulb, grabbed Ryoko in a 
tight embrace.>  "Of course my little Ryoko!  This invention, that I, 
the greatest scientist in all the universe, invented, will pull earth's 
technology to a new level. Presenting, The Chore-o-Matic, complete with 
vacuum, and duster!!"  <Ryoko stared at it about to laugh. *So my mom 
has gotten so bored on inventions that she made something to help me 
become even lazier*>
	"Why do you laugh?!?!" <Washu looked at Ryoko with confusion in 
her eyes.>
	"HAHAH!  Now I can be even lazier!!!"  <Washu looked at her 
invention and then Ryoko, knowing it was mistake...>
	"Uh..this is for ..Mihoshi's purpose..knowing the girl can't even 
use her own feet, mind a broom!"  <Ryoko laughed and rolled her eyes.>  
"Right..mom....  So where is everyone any way?"
	"Well, Sasami went shopping for dinner with Katsuhitsu, and 
Mihoshi and Kiyone got called out to patrol the Terra System.  It seems 
that some one or thing has been messing with Jurai's medical files."
	"Well then why are they paroling the Terra System?"
	"There were rumors that person or thing escaped to that system 
right after the files were noticed." 
<Ryoko, thinking about Ayeka's presence in Jurai, was wondering who 
would mess with medical files.>
	"Well, I'm going for a walk outside.  Have fun with your new 
invention.  Hahaha..*sigh*"  <*Maybe I'll be able to talk to 
Tenchi....*>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	<Tenchi sat in his 4th period History class, while listening to 
his professor drone on about the Aztecs and early Mayans.  His mind 
quickly drifted off to Ryoko.  He pictured her under the cherry blossom 
trees, the blossoms gliding to the ground around her in the wind.  *Hi 
Tenchi*  He pictured her talking to him.  *What's up?*  He then realized 
she was actually talking to him.  *Ryoko!?!  You surprised me!*
	*Caught you in the act huh?!*  Tenchi blushed and laughed >
	"Mr. Masaki, is there something funny??"  <Tenchi snapped back 
into reality, and noticed the rest of class looking at him and 
snickering.>
	"Uh..um..no..no!"
	"I clearly heard you laughing, as well as the rest of the class.  
Now pay attention."
	*Well that guy is mean!*
	*Tell me about it!*
	*Why do you have to go to school any way..?  Washu could teach you 
everything!*
	*That wouldn't help me in getting a career.*
	*Huh?  Why not!?*
	<Tenchi began to explain about college, and degrees.>
	*sigh, oh well.*
	*I'm going to have to pay attention, this teacher seems to hate me 
already.  Class is over in 10 minutes. Then I have lunch..I ca..*
	*Tenchi!!!  Can I come over there for lunch!?!?*
	*Wha..?!  Actually...sure..!*
	*Then I have to go now!  I'll be there soon!  Meet me in the back, 
where I dropped you off today!  Itsukumishu!*  <She left before he could 
say goodbye.  *sigh, that Ryoko*  Then he snapped to attention before 
his professor said any thing to him.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	*Hurray!!!  I get to see Tenchi!!!  I should probably bring my 
lunch..shouldn't I...should I wear this??  What would his friends 
say?!?!  MOM!!!!*  <Washu, working in her lab, heard her daughter 
through her mental link and was glad to hear her daughter call her 
"mom".>
	*Yes my Little Ryoko??*
	*I am going to see Tenchi for lunch..but I don't know what to say, 
wear, do..ACK!!  I'm so nervous!! Why am I so nervous!?!?*
	"Haha..that would be Zero kicking in.  Well Ryoko, you can start 
by wearing something casual, not the dress with the tail though.  You 
just want to look comfortable.  Don't worry about his friends, Tenchi 
will find something to say.  Don't hang all over him, he might get 
nervous, and besides he is at school, not home.  Make simple talk, ask 
him about his day, his teachers, if he misses you."  <She could feel 
Ryoko relax as Washu talked her through her worries.>
	"Domo Washu..er..I mean Mom..."
	*Any time Little Ryoko!*  <Ryoko then hurried off to the kitchen 
to make her lunch.  While she was making her lunch, she thought about 
her outfit.  She thought about wearing a nice kimomo, but that wouldn't 
be casual.  She decided on just wearing her red tank top and her denim 
shorts.  When she finished making her lunch, she was thinking if she 
should just teleport there or fly.  She decided to just teleport, just 
incase someone saw her flying.  *Ok Ryoko...now don't be nervous...it's 
just lunch after all!*  Then in less than a blink of an eye, she 
disappeared.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	<Tenchi was glad to be at lunch, his classes were all nightmares.  
His first class was economics.  The class was just plain boring.  It was 
hard enough not to fall asleep from lack of sleep with out the boring 
class.  Then he had gym.  He was so used to fighting with Katsuhitsu, 
that gym was a breeze.  Third was Trig.  He wondered what the deal was 
with learning math they would never use.  Fourth period was probably his 
worse.  Mr. Zatsu already hated him, and the class was history, his 
worst subject.  He thought to himself he should probably warn Ryoko 
about talking to him during that class.  As if his thinking was magic 
,Ryoko appeared behind the school.  He noticed how casual she looked in 
shorts and a tank top.  He smiled.  He also noticed how nervous she 
looked.  Since she didn't notice him, Tenchi snuck up behind her and 
wrapped his arms around her.  She jumped, and turned around ready to 
strike.  When she noticed it was him she smiled weakly.>
	"Oh..you scared me!  Not many do.."  <She smiled.>
	"Hey Ryoko, you ok?"
	"Ya..I have just never been at your school when there are other 
people.  I'm not sure what to do."
	"Just be yourself..except..."
	"I know..I know..I already talked to Washu."  <She snickered.>  "I 
brought my lunch!  So where do you eat lunch..?"
	"Where ever I want!  Where would you like to sit?"
	"I don't know..where would you like to sit?"
	"Hahah, how about by that tree."  <Tenchi and Ryoko walked over to 
the shadow of the tree and sat down.  They took out there lunch, then 
noticed Tenchi's classmates looking at Tenchi with interest.  A couple 
of the boys came over.  Ryoko noticed this and got nervous.>
	"Hey Tenchi, whose the chick?"  <Tenchi, not expecting the sudden 
visitors, answered coolly.>
	"This is Ryoko."
	"Uh...hi.."
	"Hey babe, you can sit by me whenever you want."
	"Cut the nonsense Rikomitsu."
	"Just offering the lady some company."
	"Excuse but I am fine where I am, thank you."
	"All right then...uh..nice to meet you Ryoko."  <The boys walked 
away from Tenchi and Ryoko in surprise.>
	"Well...that went well."
	"Hahahaha!"  <Tenchi smiled at Ryoko, proud of her calmness.>
	"Hey, what's so funny...and why are you smiling?!?"  <She made a 
fake look of anger.  Tenchi leaned and kissed her.  *I love you Ryoko.*>
	*Of course you do!*  <She smiled.>
	"Well let's eat!"  <Ryoko asked about his classes so far, and 
teachers.  Tenchi explained how boring his classes are so far, and 
warned her about Mr. Zatsu.  She chuckled at the sight of Tenchi 
stuttering at his teachers.  When they finished there lunch, Tenchi led 
Ryoko around the school.>
	"This is the science building."
	"I remember this building...it looks different though."
	"Well..when you blew it up, they had to rebuild part of it."  <She 
laughed.  They continued to laugh and walk around the school until the 
bell rang for his next class.  He sighed and told her that was his cue 
to leave.  She looked at him with sad eyes, but understood.  He kissed 
her and said he would see her in a couple of hours.>
	"I will wait by the bus stop until you arrive."  <He smiled.  Then 
turned around to leave.  When he got to the steps of the English 
building he turned around and waved goodbye.  She sighed and waved 
back.> 	*I might as well fly back.  Well, I had fun with Tenchi.  
Maybe I should ask him if I could join him everyday for lunch.  Now for 
the rest of the boring 2 hours...*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"...Reports say that the mysterious disappearance of the Jurian 
medical files have something to do with the sudden arrival of Ayeka 
Jurai, first princess of Jurai.  Ayeka was recently sent back to Jurai 
after a mental breakdown on Earth.  Doctors say the breakdown was due to 
past rejections.  The police have made a suspect list for the crime, but 
will not inform the press.  Here's David Hujima with the latest 
information on the...."  
	"Crime related to the sudden arrival to Ayeka?  What's that all 
about Washu?"  <Sasami, being back from her errands, looked at Washu in 
confusion.>
	"Well Sasami, some people think that because Ayeka was put in 
mental care, some one/thing might try to get revenge or take the 
opportunity to strike against Jurai.  But those are only thoughts.  No 
one really knows what happened yet."  <Washu began to worry about the 
suspects who were not named.>
	"Well I had fun!"
	"Ryoko!!"  <Sasami jumped up as she saw her friend phase into the 
room.  She ran over and glomped onto Ryoko.>  "Ryoko, police think that 
the missing medical files on Jurai might be connected to Ayeka!"
	"What..!?!  That can't be right.  They're  just trying to make 
news."  <Ryoko looked at Sasami in disbelief.>
	"Well I'm glad you disagree too!"  <The little girl smiled.  Then 
bounced off to the kitchen to put away the groceries.  Washu then walked 
over to Ryoko to ask her about lunch.>
	"Ryoko would you step into my lab for a moment.  I want to talk to 
you about your day..."
	"Sure Washu."  <Ryoko followed Washu into the lab.  When Ryoko 
stepped in, Washu shut the door behind her.>
	"So..how was lunch?"
	"Well it started off kind of nerve racking, but you were 
right...Tenchi did find something to say."  <She recalled to Washu the 
"boy incident."  The story made Washu laugh.  When Ryoko told her about 
her walk with Tenchi, Washu smiled.>
	"Well it seems you had a good time."
	"Yes, I want to ask Tenchi if I could join him more often!"  
<Washu smiled at her daughter's happiness, and walked over to give Ryoko 
a hug.  Ryoko looked confused when Washu hugger her.>
	"Hey! What are you doing?!?"  <Washu looked at her daughter with 
tear stained eyes.>
	"I am happy for you!"  <Ryoko put on a fake angry face.>
	"No hugging!"  <They both laughed.  Then the door to the lab 
opened and Sasami popped her head in.>
	"I heard laughing, what's so funny!?!"  <Washu and Ryoko just 
smiled.>
	"*sigh* Nothing really."
	"Aw, come on!!"  <Ryoko jumped on her and started tickling her.>
	"Sasami, what's so funny?"  <Sasami was laughing so hard she could 
say anything.>
	"Ry...haha..oko...hah..stop...that..tickles..hahaha"  <Ryoko 
smiled at her and let her go.  Sasami was panting for breath.  Washu 
smiled at the sight of Sasami giggling for air.  After a few seconds 
went by, Sasami looked at Washu and Ryoko in question again.>  "So what 
was so funny?"  <Washu and Ryoko just looked at each other and fell on 
the floor laughing.  Sasami looked confused.>  "Guys!  This isn't funny!  
What are you laughing at?!?!"  
	<Ryoko, with her awesome hearing, then heard the sound of a 
mechanical door opening and children's voices.  She jumped up with 
excitement and leaped out of the room.  Instead of teleporting to the 
door, she ran outside the house to find Tenchi looking back at the bus 
leaving.  Her face lit up and she ran as fast as she could to Tenchi.  
Just as Tenchi started to turn around he saw Ryoko sprinting towards 
him.  He smiled just as she plowed into him, toppling both of them over 
onto the ground.  She began showering him with kisses.>
	"Tenchi!! You're home!  I missed you so much!  I'm so glad you're 
home!  It was the longest day!"  <He just lay  back as she rambled on 
about missing him.  He smiled at her.  She finally noticed him smiling.>  
"Well....didn't you miss me!?!"  <He grinned and then turned her over, 
so he was on her.>
	"Of course I did, my Ryoko!"  <He reached in to give her kiss, 
when she phased away, and left him falling for the ground.>
	"Wahhhh!"  <She stood behind as smiled as he hit the ground.>
	*I missed you, and all you do is smile!  Hmph...*  <Tenchi turned 
around to see Ryoko pouting.  He smiled.>
	*Come back here!*  <She jumped up and dashed for the shrine.  
Tenchi got of the ground and started after her.  Ryoko began to laugh as 
she watched Tenchi try to catch her.>
	*Come on Tenchi...catch me!!*  <As she turned around, the first 
thing she saw, was Katsuhitsu.  She ran straight into him.>  "I..uh...i 
mean...sorry..."  <Tenchi stopped his running and started to laugh 
histerically.  Katsuhitsu then shot Tenchi an angry look.  Tenchi and 
Ryoko both had a frightened look on right before they sprinted off 
towards the house.  Then Katsuhitsu started to snicker.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	<Sasami was in the kitchen baking cookies, when she saw Ryoko and 
Tenchi bolt through the door and up the stairs.  She continued to stare 
in that direction looking confused.  Then she heard a door open and 
close, then laughter.  *How come I am missing everything funny!!*  She 
started up the stairs.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"Got you!"  <Tenchi pinned Ryoko to his bed.  Ryoko squirmed in 
his grip.>
	"That's not fair, I wasn't ready!"  <Tenchi laughed, but his 
laughter was cut short, by Ryoko. She phased from his grip and popped up 
in front of him.  She grinned at him.>
	"Now, that's not fair!"  He started chasing her in a circle around 
his room.  They were both laughing.  Neither of them heard the desperate 
knocking on Tenchi's door.  It then opened and in came a pouting 
Sasami.>
	"What are you guys doing!?"  <Tenchi seeing Sasami stopped to say 
something, when Ryoko jumped on him.>
	"Ha!  Too slow!!..Oh hi Sasami!"  <Sasami was smiling but trying 
to hold an angry look.  Then Tenchi and Ryoko both started after Sasami.  
They ran out of Tenchi's room and into the kitchen.>
	"Ahh!  Stop you guys!  I already got tickled enough today!!"  
<Tenchi and Ryoko stopped to catch their breath.  Sasami ran into the 
kitchen and returned to her cookies.  Ryoko came in with an innocent 
look on.  Sasami saw her and whipped around.>
	"Don't come any closer, or...else...I'll attack you with 
my...spatula.."  <She looked fierce and stuck out her lip.  She gripped 
her spatula around the handle and crept closer to Ryoko.  Ryoko smiled, 
but faked a scared look.>
	"No...Sasami..I'm not going to do anything...Please don't hurt 
me!!"  <Tenchi caught the scenario and rushed in.>
	"Don't worry Ryoko, I'll save you!"  <Sasami turned in Tenchi's 
direction and scowled.>
	"Take one more step, and I'll run ya through with this here 
spatula!"  <Tenchi crept closer.>
	"Is that a challenge?"
	"Yes it sure is!"  <Tenchi grabbed a wooden spoon and held it out 
like a sword.  The two "warriors" jabbed at their opponent, hitting 
nothing but air.  Tenchi then threw in a quick jab near Sasami's side 
and she held it near.>
	"Ahhhh...."  <She fell to the floor, pretending to be slain.  
Tenchi then turned to Ryoko and literally swept her off her feet.  He 
carried her outside to the dock next to the lake.  He looked deep into 
her eyes and their breath quickened, hearts raced, and...*SPLASH*,  
Yagami crashed into the lake.  Ryoko and Tenchi jumped in fright until 
they saw it was Yagami.  Then they looked at each other and laughed.  
Tenchi put Ryoko down to help Mihoshi and Kiyone out of the ship.>
	"Looks like Mihoshi was piloting again."  <Mihoshi came out of 
Yagami with her usual cheery grin, but carrying Kiyone.  Tenchi and 
Ryoko ran to them, soon followed by a curious Sasami.>
	"Mihoshi!  What's wrong with Kiyone?"  <Mihoshi tried moving 
Kiyone over to her other arm, to support her.>
	"Well, after we got off of duty today, Kiyone and I decided to go 
sing some kareoke.  Well, I guess Kiyone had a little...too much to 
drink.  I tried to convince her to let me pilot, but she kept repeating 
how I would crash.  And that's why we crashed!"  <Ryoko, surprised, 
looked at Tenchi.>
	*Kiyone..crashed Yagami!?!*
	*That's my reaction too!*
	"Mihoshi, is Kiyone ok??"  <Mihoshi smiled at the worried child.>
	"She'll be fine.  She just needs to get some sleep."
	"You can put her in my room!"  <Mihoshi smiled again, in 
gratitude.>
	"Thanks Sasami."  <Mihoshi walked with Sasami to put down Kiyone.  
Ryoko started to follow, when Tenchi grabbed her hand, stopping her.  
She whipped around and looked at him with wide eyes.>
	"Tenchi...what are you doing??"  <He smiled at her.>
	"You said you should show me the mountains behind the house.  
Well, how about right now?"  <Ryoko thought for a moment.  *Hmm, he 
usually doesn't do this..but Kiyone needs attention and I should stay to 
help..but I want to go with Tenchi..*  Tenchi noticed how Ryoko's face 
looked like she was fighting with herself.  *Come on Ryoko..*  Ryoko 
looked at Tenchi and gave in.>
	"Alright!  Come on Tenchi!"  <She smiled as he wrapped his arms 
around her waist.>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	"...people are advised to stay inside, lock their houses and stay 
alert.  This criminal will be stopped.  This is David Hujima signing 
out."
	"No..it couldn't be...NOOOOO!"  <Washu started to convulse as she 
looked upon the screen of her laptop.  She began to cry like a small 
child.  She brought up her legs and sobbed.  She then shot up her head 
and scrambled onto her feet.  The door to her lab swung open and Washu 
ran out of it as fast as her child-like legs could go.  She sprang out 
of the house looking frantically for Ryoko.>  "Ryoko!  Ryoko!  RYOKO!"  
<She felt her knees go weak as she crumbled to the ground. 
*Ryoko..RYOKO!  Ryoko please answer me!!*  She got no response.  She sat 
on the ground whimpering, until she decided to return to her lab.  She 
tried to hide her tears so the others wouldn't suspect something was 
wrong, she didn't want to worry them.  She opened her lab door and 
walked inside.  Her laptop was still on, but the horrible news wasn't.  
Sounds of earth sports were heard now on the news. She sat down at her 
computer and awaited her daughter's return....>
