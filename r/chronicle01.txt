Chapter 1

	It was 8:00 AM in the afternoon on a beautiful sunny
Saturday morning at a quiet Masaki household.  The Cherry
Blossoms bloomed with beauty and style as the gentle morning
breezes blew off a few petals.  The lake glimmered with an
almost blinding reflection as the docks at the back porch
created a marina-like scene.

	Inside, the house was absolutely still.  Everyone was
fast asleep.  The only thing moving inside the abode was
Ryo-Ohki in child form.  She woke up in her bed in her room.
It seemed like she really liked being in her child form....
mostly due to the fact that she could eat more carrots in
than if she were in her cabbit form.

	"Myaaaaaaa..." yawns the young cabbit, stretching her
arms out in the process. She then gets out of bed. 
*Grrrrooooowwwwwlllll...*.   Ryo-Ohki stops suddenly,
pondering on where the noise came from.
*GRRROOOOOWWWWWLLLLL!!!!!...*.    She that moment she
realized that it was her stomach going off the Richter
scale.  She needed something to eat... and fast.  She
hurriedly ran upstairs to wake up Sasami, who was still
dead asleep in her and Ayeka's room.  Ryo-Ohki had to be
careful not to trip on any of the steps since she was
continuing to gain a center of gravity.

	She came arrived on the second floor, where Ryoko's
room was located.  Hoping that the 700-year-old demon
wasn't awake, Ryo-Ohki attempted to peek her head into
Ryoko's room to make sure, only to hit her head on the
door.  Meow...  `Darn it... happens every time,' thought
Ryo-Ohki, rubbing the sore that had appeared on her
forehead.  She tried again, this time, turning
incorporeal. Her head appeared on the other side of Ryoko's
bedroom door.  The little girl looked around and found
Ryoko fast asleep with a smile on her face, with drool
inching down on her right cheek of her face, and with a
murmur repeated "Tenchi... Tenchi..."   Ryo-Ohki
grimaced a little and quickly brought her head back
into the hallway.

	`*whew*  well, she's asleep, that's the good part.
The not so good part was that look on Ryoko's face.  She
must be having one of her off-the-wall fantasies about
Tenchi again...' thought Ryo-Ohki.  She shrugged her
shoulders and slowly proceeded to scale the third floor
staircase.

	The tired and still hungry chibi Ryo-Ohki finally
reached the third floor. Her stomach continued to growl
even more.  Losing energy quickly,  Ryo-Ohki got onto her
hands and knees and crawled It seemed an eternity before
the young girl reached the door leading into Sasami and
Ayeka's room.  Ryo-Ohki gently knocked on the door.

	"I'm coming, I'm coming," called out a voice.
Within 5 seconds the door opened and Sasami emerged from
the room with her hair down.  "Ryo-Ohki! Did you come
all the way up here?"  *GRRRROOOOOWWWWWLLLLL!*  "Silly
you! You must be starving to death." said Sasami, patting
Ryo-Ohki on the head.  "Meeeooowww," cooed the little
girl, who struggled herself onto her feet.  Suddenly,
she stumbled taking a hold of Sasami's legs to regain
keep her balance.  Ryo-Ohki gave a sigh of relief.
"C'mon, I'll fix you breakfast.  Let`s see... what
should I fix you this morning?" Ryo-Ohki slapped her
forehead in disbelief.

Chapter 2

	The smell of Sasami's cooking began to have an
affect on the other slumbering individuals, except for
Lord Katsuhito, who had already left to go to the shrine.
The first one to arrive downstairs was Tenchi, whose hair
looked like it had been through a civil war, which was
unnoticed by Tenchi himself.  Sasami giggled at the sight
of the hairdo.  "What's so funny?" asked Tenchi, stupefied.
"Oh... *giggle* nothing. Good Morning."  Ryo-Ohki went up
to Tenchi and gave him a big hug. Tenchi kneeled down and
returned the cabbit sweet gesture with a hug of his own.

	"Good Morning everyo....whoa...Ah...AAAAAHHHH..."
*crash* *slam* *boom* *bang*. Tenchi rushed out of the
kitchen only to trip over an already fallen Mihoshi and
land flat on his face. *BAMM!*  "Are you okay, Tenchi"
cried the bubble-head, who struggled to help Tenchi onto
his feet.  "I'll be fine." he replied.

	After eating breakfast, Mihoshi got up and went
upstairs to change into some other clothes.  Shortly
after, she appeared downstairs dressed in some casual
wear with a purse at her side.  "Don't tell me you're
going shopping Mihoshi!!!" cried Tenchi.  "Of course. Why?"
Sasami quickly came over and put her hand over Tenchi's
mouth and said, "Oh... nothing really. Have a good time."
Mihoshi paused for a moment, staring at the two for a brief
moment before smiling,  "Okay. Later."  Tenchi pulled
Sasami's hand away from his mouth and gave her a glare.
Sasami gave Tenchi a abnormal smile and went back to her
cooking.

************************************************************

	"Now where could that bus be." wondered Mihoshi as
she waited for the city bus to arrive...  *Vroom* "Ah, here
it is." The bus came to a stop and slowly the door opened.
She boarded the vehicle, which had a weird stench to it.
`Where am I gonna sit?' thought Mihoshi, looking around for
any open seats available.  "You can sit here if you want to..."
said a young man sitting near the back, who began to move a
sports bag out of an occupied seat.  He had short, smooth,
brown hair, black eyes, was in his late teens, and was very
similar looking to Tenchi.  He was wearing a green long-
sleeved jacket and a pair of dark blue jeans.  "Thank you."
uttered Mihoshi, as she sat down in the seat that had been
given to her.  "Mm-hmm." muttered the young man, and turned
his head to face the window.  The bus closed the doors, and
began to move.  Mihoshi noticed something different about
him, but couldn't figure out what that "something" was.

************************************************************

	Meanwhile, back at the Masaki household, everyone had
woken from their deep slumber.  Ryoko appeared in the
kitchen and wrapped her arms tightly around Tenchi's chest.
"Goooood Moooorrrnnniinnng, my dear Tenchi!" cried the demon.
"Argh... good morning... to... you... too... Ryoko.   Now..
Let me go," mumbled Tenchi, who struggled to break free of
Ryoko's tight grasp.  A tap on Ryoko's shoulder caused the
demon to relinquish her tight squeeze on Tenchi.  She turned
around, and much to her surprise... *BONG*... Ryoko was
whacked on her head by a frying pan by none other than...
(you know) Ayeka herself.  "How many times must I tell you,
you poor excuse for a woman... LEAVE LORD TENCHI ALONE!!!"
yelled the enraged princess, red in the face with steam
exploding from her ears.  On the floor, Ryoko was sprawled
out on the floor with and had a number of miniature Ryo-Ohki
dancing around her head.  "OnNnNnN s-sEcOnD thoOght, I tHiNk
I'lL gO pLaY cOoKiEs WiTh MoMmY..." garbled the demon, who
was speaking in a dazed and confused.  Suddenly, Washu appeared
behind Ryoko with a sparkle in her green eyes.  Everyone else
except Ryoko, who was still in her state, coiled back,
grimacing in fear.  Ryo-Ohki was scared out of her wits. The
genius scientist then spread her arms out, then wrapped her
arms around her daughter. "Ryoko, you really do care about
me... You really care!!!" Everyone burst out in maniacal
laughter.

************************************************************

	The city bus arrived at a stop in downtown Okayama.
Mihoshi and the stranger proceeded to step off the bus. After
the bus had left, both persons began to go in opposite
directions.  Mihoshi suddenly stopped and turned into the
opposite way, looked at him and shouted "I never got your
name!" The young man came to an abrupt halt. He turned his
head and replied "Its Sabi.  Sabi Shimazaki!" turned back to
continue his course.  `I think he's kinda cute' thought
Mihoshi, who began to giggle blush.  She gave a strange sigh
and then headed for the shopping center.

Chapter 3

	Nightfall had arrived and Mihoshi was exhausted.  She
arrived at a bus stop near an alley and a small bookstore.
She was very tired and her eyes became very heavy.  Suddenly,
in the background, three strange and rough voices surfaced from
the alley.  "Look at her." muttered one.  "Yeah, she's pretty
good lookin." said another.  "Let's get her." whispered the
third.  The other two agreed and began to emerge from the         shadows of 
the alley.  The first person was a tall man with a
black leather jacket and pants with blue hair and green eyes.
The second was short, had a black sleeveless shirt and had blue
jeans, had black hair and gray eyes.  The third was stocky with a
t-shirt and a pair of torn pants.  The first person put his right
hand to his side and drew a samurai sword from a sheath.  As he approached 
Mihoshi, his accomplices stood by his side.

	The man with the samurai sword brought the blade to her
neck, and placed his hand over Mihoshi's mouth.  She awakened immediately.  
"Mrmph!" shouted Mihoshi, which was muffled by
the hand that covered her mouth.  "Shut up or else your neck's
gonna taste this blade." cried the thug.  He then dragged her
away to the alley.  Mihoshi furiously kicked and screamed with
all of her strength, but was not successful.  It seemed that
she was no match for the aggressor's strength.

	The three punks quickly tied her up, gagged her with a
bandanna, and tossed her against the wall.  "Hey boss, I got
her purse." shouted one of the men.  "Shut up, you damned
idiot!  Do you want someone to hear you?!" hollered the boss.
"See what you can find." "Sure, boss."

	Mihoshi started to try and free herself from the ropes
that bound her hands together and wished she was home at the
same time. She wanted to be in the peaceful tranquility of
the Masaki Residence.  The Galaxy Police officer's attempt
to free herself intensified greatly.  All the tugging at the
ropes tired her quickly and she was forced to stop and catch
her breath.  `No......'

	"Hey boss.  This chick's loaded with cash." exclaimed
the punk known as Shadow, this time, keeping his voice down.
The boss looked at Mihoshi as she struggled to break free.
"Heh-heh-heh. Just lookin' at her struggle herself to death
makes me laugh." Mihoshi lowered her head in disbelief and
began to shed tears, which slowly rolled down her gentle
cheeks to her chin.  The tears dropped and landed on her legs
one by one, soaking her blue jeans.  She began to assume that
she would never come out of this alive, never to see any of
her friends that she loved so dearly.  "You might as well say
your prayers, cause you won't be alive to see the morning sun." snickered 
the boss.  He once again drew his sword from its
sheath.  Bringing the sword up, he gave Mihoshi his last words.
"I really don't want to do this, but we can't afford ourselves
to be targeted by the cops.  Besides, it's for your own good."
Despite the gag that covered her mouth, Mihoshi screamed at
the top of her lungs, struggling for the last time  `This is
the end,' she thought, `This is it...'


Chapter 4

	The sword began to come down.  *SLASH*  The sound of
metal being sliced filled the air.  The three crooks and
Mihoshi looked around to see what had happened.  The boss
looked back at Mihoshi, sword pointed at her.  The sword,
however had been sliced in half. The front half of the
sword  This infuriated the boss.  " Huh?!?  WHO DID THIS?!?!"
he demanded.  "I did. Got a problem with it?" came the reply.
"Who are you?! Come out where I can see you!" "Have it your
way." Everyone then heard footsteps coming into the alley,
they turned their heads toward the sound.  A figure then
began to appear.  Mihoshi's irises grew small.  She
couldn't believe her own eyes.  The figure approaching
was... Sabi himself!  But how was it possible.  How did
he find her?  There were so many questions that were
unanswered.

	"You will pay for breaking my sword, you little
nuisance." declared the really pissed off boss.  " And
just how are you going to do that?" asked Sabi.  "You and
your pals might as well untie her and get the hell out of
this alley. You are starting to make me sick. I can't
believe you do these things.  Especially to defenseless
women like her" he snarled, as he referred to Mihoshi.
The bossed just laughed at him.  "Hah!  You don't scare
us one bit, kid!"  the other two joined in as well.  In
a sudden move, Shadow raced forward with a pair of
nunchucku.

(Author's Note: If you think I am copying the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, THINK AGAIN!!!!!!!!!)

	He jumped into the air, preparing to attack.  Sabi
reached into his jacket and pulled out two objects. They
appeared to look like power catalysts handles.  It had
four ends to it, all next to each other.  They had the
same color and decoration, much like the Tenchi-ken
(Master key),only these weapons looked nothing alike.
Mihoshi was astonished!

	"I warned you!!!" snarled Sabi, clenching his fists
tightly around the catalysts.  In a flash, four purple
energy blades materialized on the ends of each catalyst
to form four blades into a katar weapon form.  "NOW YOU
DIE!!!!!!" the punk shouted as he brought the two weapons
downward. He slashed upwards as Shadow began to attack.
The energy blades cut through the chains of the nunchucku
without wounding him in one motion.  Shadow landed on the
ground.  "How in the... how did he... w-who is this guy?"
uttered the attacker, who was in a state of disbelief.
"I'm outta here!!!" cried Shadow.  He ran as fast as he
could, and as far as his legs could take him.  "One down,
one to go" said Sabi with a snicker on his face. He ran
over to Mihoshi to make sure her kidnappers had not abused
her.  The third punk came forward and brought a gun from
his pants pocket.  Sabi didn't make a single move.  `Oh,
damn.  I wasn't planning on this,' thought the youngster.
"Say your prayers, `cause you're both gonna die now!"
shouted the gun holder.  He cocked the gun and prepared
to fire.

	Sabi and Mihoshi both trembled as they prepared to
have their lives end.  They closed their eyes...*BLAM!*...
a long silence filled the air........... "Huh?..."  the
bullet had been stopped and lay on the ground, unscathed.
"W-w- what's going on?" said the punk.  The gun was fired
multiple times at Sabi.  Then Sabi saw why the first bullet
had been stopped.  In front of him, appeared two light blue
objects .  "Uh...boss? I think we'd better get out of here!"
They both took off running, leaving Mihoshi's purse behind.

	Sabi quickly untied Mihoshi, who took off the gag.
She immediately embraced him, tears coming down her face.
Sabi responded the same, but without tears.  "H-how did you
f-find me?" she cried.  "Not now... not now." Tears began
to form in his eyes. It's going to be okay. Let's get you
home now.  Your family must be worried sick." he spoke.
Mihoshi faced him and kissed him.  Sabi was caught off guard
by the kiss  She parted her lips from his and replied,
"Okay..."  Still tired and weak,  Mihoshi slowly picked
herself up, then her knees buckled, and collapsed into his
arms.  "Poor woman.  I better take her back to my place for
the night."  said Sabi, picking her up in his arms, and
carrying her off into the depths of the night.  `My question
is, how did we survive?' he pondered.
