without further ado *drum roll*...

=======================================================================
Yesterday...
=======================================================================

        He couldn't believe it.  She had left, just like that.  Without
another
word.  She was gone, just when he needed her the most.  And oh, how he
needed her...
        Ryoko was gone.  She had been gone for over 7 months.
        Tenchi had chosen her.  Over Aeka, over Mihoshi, over Kiyone, over
Sasami,
over Washu...over everyone.  Why?  Because he loved her with all of his
heart.  And he couldn't forget about his love for her, either, even though
she had been gone for so long.
        Aeka?  She was inconsolable.  She claimed that she never, EVER liked
that
space pirate bitch.  Nobody believed her, though.  Ryoko was her best
friend, and they knew it.  So, they just let her babble on.  Lately, she
had taken many walks.  They all let her.  She'd gotten somewhat
better...she tried flirting with Tenchi, occasionally, but she was always
turned down.
        Poor Sasami.  She had gone into a cleaning frenzy.  She really did
adore
Ryoko.  And she hated to see Tenchi the way he was.  So, she reacted the
only way she could: she cleaned and cooked.
        Mihoshi was her usual self.  She just acted a little more ditzy.
Hell,
she couldn't help it.  She liked Ryoko, and all, but she was never very
close to the woman.
        Kiyone.  She went about her life.  She seemed, in a way, happy that
the
pirate had left.  After all, she didn't have to worry about a wanted
criminal, anymore, did she?  But she still missed the woman...the Masaki
house just wasn't the same without the hectic demoness.
        Washu just didn't.  She couldn't.  She really did love her daughter,
despite how she acted toward the woman.  She just stayed in her lab.  She
only came up for meals, and even then, she was withdrawn more than ever.
She ate her food, usually finished before everyone else, and excused
herself to her lab.  She had the right to, though.  She couldn't read where
her daughter was, and this was the second time she had lost a child.  She
didn't even try to expirement on Tenchi anymore.
        Tenchi couldn't sleep anymore.  He mostly went about his usual
chores as
much as he could.  But, sometimes, he couldn't even get out of bed from
lack of sleep.  Sure, he got a few hours of sleep.  But it wasn't the deep,
restful sleep of the content.  It was the light, troubled sleep of the sad.
 He woke up at the tiniest sound.
        He loved Ryoko...and she wasn't there anymore...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        One night, Tenchi lay in bed.  He was reading a book.  Reviving
Ophelia.
It came from...from her room.  It wasn't a bad book.  Not bad at all.
        He couldn't sleep.  He had taken to reading books that she had
interests
in.  Good taste, she had.  Indeed, good taste.
        He glanced over to the clock.  4:19 AM.  He sighed, and turned on
the
radio.  A song by the Beatles was playing.  It went like this:

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday...
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know
She wouldn't say...
I said something wrong
Now I long for
Yesterday
Mmmm mmm mm mmm mmmmm mmmm mmmm...

        A smirk crawled over Tenchi's face.  "That song represents me so
well..."
he murmured, and sighed.  He set the book down after marking it, then got
out of bed.  He was only wearing his boxer shorts, but he didn't care.  He
opened the room to his door, and looked down the hall.  He then snuck down
the stairs, and to the door of Ryoko's room.
        He pushed the door open, and stepped into the room, closing the door
behind himself.  Ryoko's smell immediately wafted into his nostrils.  He
sighed, and walked over to her bed, laying down softly.  Coming in here
always helped him sleep.  He closed his eyes, inhaling her scent.
"Ryoko...come back, please...I love you, and I need you SO much...more than
anything...please!!!" he begged of the room.  Tears flowed freely down his
face, and he reached up with a hand and wiped his eyes.  "I...need you..."
he whispered again, and shuddered.  Exhaustion washed over him, suddenly,
and he quickly drifted off to sleep.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Ryoko wasn't, indeed, far from the Masaki house.  She was camping
out in
the branches of Funaho, Yosho's tree.  Being in her prescence soothed her
so, and she was capable of knowing where Tenchi was.
        This night, she knew exactly what Tenchi was thinking.  She had
developed
a link with him, he just didn't know she had.  She cried like she had the
first time Tenchi, when he was a little boy, had gone away to be with his
friends.  She cried now like she had when she had seen Tenchi hugging Aeka
by the very tree that she was in, now.
        "Tenchi...I wish I could come back...I really do...but my being
there, my
being with you...it hurt Aeka too much.  I can't stay, Tenchi..." she told
the night sky, and buried her face in her hands.  She just let herself fall
into sobbing.
        "Ryoko, go to him..." said a voice from the ground.
        The ex space pirate wiped her eyes, then looked to Aeka.  "I can't!
You
love him, it's your chance to get with him.  Leave me alone!" she hissed,
though her voice was tear-choked.
        Aeka shook her head.  "Go to him.  I couldn't take your place, even
if I
wanted to.  Go to him now, Ryoko.  He needs you.  I want you to go to
him..." she whispered.
        Ryoko bit her lip.  "...are you sure?"
        "Everybody's worse without you, Ryoko!!!  We all miss you...the
house
isn't the same without you.  Go to him, I order you to!!!" the princess
hissed.
        Ryoko closed her eyes, and dissapeared.  "I will go to him." her
voice
echoed after she was gone.
        Aeka smiled sadly, sitting down on a rock.  "It's all okay, now.
Like
I've said before...if Tenchi ever fell in love with somebody that wasn't
me, then I'd just go about my life as if nothing happened.  That has
happened, now.  I'll stay here...I'll just forget about my love for Tenchi.
 I can love again, I know I can..." she whispered to herself, clenching her
fists and shaking her head.  Tears of saline wet her skin, and she closed
her eyes, smiling even more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Ryoko appeared in her old room.  There he was.  She sat on the bed
beside
him, stroked his cheek lovingly with her gloved hand.
        Tenchi stirred lightly, but he didn't awaken.  "Ryoko...come back to
me..." he whispered in his sleep.
        Tears sprang to the woman's eyes.  "Tenchi...I'm right here.  I'm
back...and I'll never leave again." she whispered.  Sniffling, she leaned
over, and kissed the man softly on the cheek.  "Ever." she added.  With a
weak smile, she lay down beside the man, snuggled into his side.
        Tenchi shook his head, then opened his eyes to gaze down upon Ryoko.
He
smiled a true, happy smile, for the first time since Ryoko had left.
"Good.  I'm glad for it...I love you, Ryoko-chan...you promise you'll never
leave, right, Ryoko?" he asked, wrapping his arms around her.
        Ryoko lifted her head, smiling up at Tenchi.  "I promise, Tenchi.
Never,
ever, will I leave you.  I..." she paused, and flushed red, wrapping her
arms around his waist.  "...I love you..." she added, and smiled.
        Tenchi smiled.  "I love you, too, Ryoko." he replied.  "Come
on...let's
sleep.  I think we both need it." he murmured, and squeezed her softly.
        Ryoko nodded.  "Hai, let's." she replied, and rested her head softly
against Tenchi's chest, closing her eyes.  She immediately drifted off to
sleep.
        Tenchi sighed, settling back on the bed.  He gazed at the ceiling,
smiling.  Soon, sleep overtook him...and it was, to him, the deepest,
happiest sleep he had ever slept.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Aeka walked up the steps.  She paused and looked at the door to
Ryoko's
room, and smiled softly.  "Sleep well, Tenchi...Ryoko." she murmured, and
continued up the stairs.  She entered her room, smiled at the sleeping form
of Sasami.  She went about getting dressed for bed.  Brushed her hair.
With a sigh, she lay on her futon, pulling the covers over her body.
        Her ruby-red eyes stared up at the dark ceiling, sparkling with
tears.
"Tenchi....I'm so happy for you...it's funny, I love you...and I'm happy
that you're happy with Ryoko..." she whispered, and closed her eyes.  For
the first time since the space pirate had left, Aeka fell asleep.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Sasami knocked on Ryoko's door.  She'd not found Tenchi in his room,
so
she assumed that he was in here.  "Tenchi, breakfast is ready!  Come and
get it before it gets cold!!!"
        The door opened, a sleepy-looking Ryoko standing there, wearing a
tank top
and boxers...probably Tenchi's clothing.  She smiled.  "Hey, Sasami.  Hope
you made enough for me, too..." she murmured, and chuckled, rubbing the
back of her head.
        Sasami's pink eyes grew wide, and she hugged Ryoko.  "Ryoko, you're
back!!!  I'm so glad!!!" she exclaimed, and looked up at the cyan-haired
woman.  "I made just enough for you, still!" she added, and giggled.
        Ryoko chuckled.  "That's great.  I'm gonna get dressed, okay?" she
asked
with a smile, patting Sasami's head lightly.
        Sasami nodded.  "Where's Tenchi?" she asked curiously.
        Ryoko stepped to one side to show Tenchi sleeping on his bed.  "He's
asleep.  For the first time since I left, he's sleeping soundly.  Let's let
him sleep, hai?" she asked.
        Sasami smiled, and nodded.  "Hai.  I'll go set his portion of food
aside."
she replied, and ran off.
        The woman watched her run off, smiling.  "It's good to be back..."
she
whispered to herself, then went back into the room, closing the door behind
herself.  She walked over to Tenchi, covering him gently with the blanket,
and kissing him on the cheek.  "Love you." she whispered, then
straightened.  She quickly got dressed in one of her many outfits that
flaunted her body to the world.  She teleported into Tenchi's room, got him
some clothing, and went back to her room, setting the man's clothing at the
foot of the bed.  She then teleported into the dining room.
        Sasami had breakfast ready.  It never looked more delicious.
Suddenly,
the cyan-haired woman felt arms close around her waist...and then, they
squeezed.  Hard.  She looked down to see Mihoshi...and Washu, both glomping
her.  "Uh...can't breath, guys..." she murmured, her eyes bulging a bit.
The two let go quickly.
        Everybody was overjoyed that Ryoko had returned.  The breakfast
table was
full of life, everybody talking.  The space pirate, herself, was relatively
quiet, letting the people talk.  She ate her food contentedly, thinking of
the man she loved, smiling.
        She helped clear the table, clean the dishes, etc.  She then
returned to
her room.  Tenchi still slept happily.  So, the woman sat on the floor,
reading her books.  Life was so good for her right now.  She glanced at her
true love every so often as he slept.  After she finished a book, she lay
beside him, snuggling into his side.  It was noon, and he was still asleep.
        Tenchi opened his eyes softly, and smiled at Ryoko.  "Good
morning..." he
murmured, and hugged her.
        Ryoko glanced up at him.  "Morning, Tenchi...did you sleep well?"
she
asked with a smile.
        Tenchi nodded softly.  "Hai.  Very." he replied, and sat up, causing
Ryoko
to sit up with him.  "I'm going to go shopping, today, Ryoko.  I need to
get something." he murmured, and smiled.  "And I want you to stay here, my
sweet." he added, and chuckled.
        Ryoko smirked.  "Allright." she replied, and placed a soft kiss on
his
lips.  "I laid out your clothes for you.  I promise not to watch if you
don't-"
        "You've seen me with practically no clothes before, Ryoko.  The
least I'll
be wearing is my boxers, what I'm wearing now." he murmured, and chuckled.
He kissed her on the forehead, then went about getting dressed.
        Ryoko watched every move he made, a smile on her face.  "Tenchi...I
love
you." she murmured softly as he finished.
        Tenchi smiled at her, and kissed her on the forehead once again.  "I
love
you too, Ryoko...I'll be back soon..." he replied, and squeezed her hand.
He then walked out of the room.
        Ryoko laughed, laying back on the bed and tucking her arms behind
her
head.  "My life is perfect!" she exclaimed to the ceiling, and smiled.  She
closed her eyes, and before she knew it, she was drifting off to sleep.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        "That one!  It's perfect!" Tenchi exclaimed, pointing to a golden
ring
with a heart-shaped diamond on it, and two sapphire stars on each side.
"Size 5." he noted to the jeweler, who chose a the ring out, and handed it
to the man.  He quickly paid for it, got a blue velvet box, and tucked it
in his pocket.  Then, he rushed home as fast as his legs would carry him.
        Ryoko was asleep, on the bed, smiling.  She was so beautiful...he
wanted
to spend his life with her.  He sat down beside her, and took her hand,
kissing it.  "Ryoko...wake up.  We're going on a date tonight..." he
murmured.
        The woman opened her eyes, and smiled, sitting up.  "Oh?  And where
would
this be?" she asked, giggling a bit.
        "To any place you want." he replied.
        A smile brightened her face.  "I know..." she murmured.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        Tenchi laid the blanket on the warm rock, and set the basket down.
He lit
the chinese lanterns, and then sat down, Ryoko joining him.
        "You know, Tenchi, when you came here and played...I watched you.
You
were so beautiful, I fell in love with you." she murmured, and smiled to
him as she ate a bite of the sushi.  "You still are beautiful, Tenchi.
Just watching you made me feel warm, even though that cave was so cold."
        Tenchi smiled.  "I always felt warm and happy when I was here...I
guess it
was because you were here, watching me." he replied, munching on the rice
ball that Ryoko had made...and it was actually good!
        So, they chatted as they ate.  For desert, sake...Tenchi actually
drank
some willingly.  Then, there were Rice Cakes, flavored with Coconut milk.
Ryoko made these, too...and they were delicious.  She must've taken cooking
lessons from Sasami.
        Toward the end, while they looked up at the moon over the peak of
Ryoko's
cave, Tenchi suddenly stood up, grabbing Ryoko and setting her on her feet.
 He then kneeled down, drawing the blue velvet box from his pocket.
"Ryoko...I always have loved you with all my heart.  Even when I didn't
know you, I loved you.  And I want to spend my life with you." he murmured,
and opened the box.
        Ryoko smiled joyfully, her eyes brightening, yet tears forming in
her eyes...
        Tenchi cleared his throat.  "Ryoko...will you marry me?" he asked,
taking
the ring from it's box and sliding it onto her finger.  A perfect fit.
        Ryoko nodded.  "Yes, Tenchi...yes, I will marry you!" she replied,
and
kneeled down, hugging him.  "Yes..." she repeated, crying into his shoulder.
        "What's the matter, Ryoko?  Why are you crying?" asked Tenchi, as he
hugged her...but he felt like crying, too...out of happiness.
        "I'm so happy..." she replied, and hugged him a tiny bit tighter
than before.
        "So am I, Ryoko...so am I." he replied, and joined in her joyous
tears,
hugging her tightly to himself.
