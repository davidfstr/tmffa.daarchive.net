I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THEASE CHARACTORS!  THEY BELONG TO PIONEER AND A 
FEW OTHERS, I THINK!---K?

A fast review, Ryoko just woke-up in bed with Tenchi, then had to TROW-UP!
On to Chapter 2, the first one was only the prolugue.(Sorry on spelling!)

Our Hearts, Part 2


    

	Washu walked up to the bathroom door and waited until she didn't hear
 puke noises. Then she opened the door a little, and peered into the bathroom.
 Only then did she notice that someone was already in there, trying to get
 Ryoko to feel better.

 	"Ryoko, Are you gonna be okay now?" She heard Sasami say.

 	"Yea kid, I'll be OK.  I...just don't feel really good right now." 

 	"Do you want me to bring you up your breakfast?  I can fix your favorite."

 	"Sasami?" They turned their heads twords Washu. "You don't need to do that.
 I think all Ryoko needs is a nice, warm, relaxing soke in the Women's Bath, Ok?"

 	"Washu?" Ryoko looked unsure. "I...I..I can't, what I..I mean i..is," She
let out a sigh. "Sasami?  can I have a word alone with Washu? I don't want to
make you upset but, I don't think I want breakfast this morning. Maybe lunch, but
I think I will take most of the time in the bath, talking to Was...Ah!" 

 	After that, Washu pulled Sasami out of the bathroom. "Sasami, please don't
take this the wrong way but, just go down to the kitchen, and don't tell anyone 
anything about Ryoko being sick. I don't think Ryoko would like that. Alright?"

 	Sasami went down to the kitchen to finish breakfast.  Washu opened the door
again, and this time, teleported Ryoko, and herself to the Women's Bath. "Ryoko, 
just get washed up and only return when you feel like you're hungry, or when you 
feel like your not going to 'get sick' again, okay?"  All Ryoko did was sit there,
and almost vomit, AGAIN!  

 	Washu left, and Ryoko started batheing.  Not long after, Ayeka came in for her 
morning soke.  She stopped when she seen Ryoko already there. Ayeka slowly steped into
the water and woundered why Ryoko didn't say anything yet. Maybe she didn't even know
she was there.

	"Ryoko? can you please hand me the sake, before you drink it all."

	"Ayeka, leave me alone. You can get your own sake."

                          Author's Note: send me an e-mail if you want the
                                         picture that shows what ryoko
                                         looks like when she says this!^ , ~

	"Well, someone seems to have woken up on the wrong side of bed today."
When Aeka said that, it sent Ryoko on the verge of tears, because of last night.

	"Oh Ryoko, you should cheer up.  Mother and Funaho are comeing over tonight.
Anyway, why are you really sad, you have never acually been sad unless someone was about
 to die. What is..."

	"SHUT THE F*CK UP, AYEKA! I...AH!"  Then she threw up. 

	"Oh, my. Ryoko. Are you sick? What's wrong. I know I shouln't really worry about
you.  But, you need to get better, so when Mother and Aunt Funaho comes, THEY won't get
sick because of YOU!"  Just then, they heard a spaceship land by the lake. "Good, they're
here. Come Ryoko.  Let us go meet them."

	They got dressed and went off.  When they got there, everyone else was already 
there.  Masaki was already doing her job of 'loveable hugging,' and Yosho was speaking
with his mother, Funaho.  

	Once Ryoko saw Tenchi, she kind of froze in place, and Funaho noticed this.
She decided that she would find out why Ryoko and Tenchi acted this way around each-other, by 
asking washu.  "Excuse me Yosho, I must talk to Miss Washu for a moment."
        "Yes, Mother. Shall I let you talk alone?"
	"Yes, I need to ask her something about a few of the house members."

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

	Funaho waited for Yosho to bring Washu here.<I wounder what's going on. Last
year, all Ryoko could do was hang on him. Also, she and Ayeka could do nothing more but 
fight over him. Hmmm.> 
	Washu calmly walked over to Funaho, having a very good feeling why she wanted to 
talk to her. "Lady Funaho. What have I done so great, that you would pleasure me by allowing
me to talk with you?" 

	"Young Washu. I would suggjest we go and talk at the shrine. I need to talk to you 
alone about a few member's behavior. Yosho will stay here, so, no need to worry about him
hearing us."

	Washu smirked at the 'Young Washu' title.  "Why Funaho! It would be a pleasure! 'Sure!'
Let me guess.  This is about Ryoko and Tenchi?"  Funaho nodded.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	When they got there, Funaho took a seat at one end of a table, and Washu took
a seat at the other end. Yosho already had a pot of tea in the middle, so Washu didn't
have to make any. 

	"Tell me Washu. What has gotten into Ryoko and Tenchi? They seem so, how can I 
put it, so far away from everyone else. Tell me.  Has something personel happendend
between the two of them?"
	"Well, I wouldn't say 'gotten into them,'I would rather say'what has 
happendend to Tenchi, then to Ryoko.  It will make more sense when I explain what is
going on."  Washu smiled slyly, as she told Funaho all that she needed to know...

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


	Ryoko sat as far away from Tenchi as much as possible. She didn't want Tenchi to 
think that she got him drunk and in bed on purpose. That's not it at all! If that WAS
what he thought, then Tenchi thought Ryoko was a whore! But then, if he knew what really
went on last night,he thought she was easy. She let him, even though he is never wild, that's 
what happens when you get drunk. You don't think.  Sure, she'normally'would pull something like 
that, but, she wasn't serious. She was trying to get Tenchi a nose-bleed, and Ayeka's goat.

	"Well Ryoko. What do you think?"

	"Huh? What?"

	Masaki was looking at Ryoko, asking her...

	"I just asked you what you thought about myself and Funaho staying here untill our
husband is finished with the war in galactic Juri?"

	"There's no problem. Why ask me?"

	Right before she asked, Washu and Funaho walked in the door. Funaho answered for 
Masaki.  "Well, since she asked everyone else, why not ask you?" As she said this, everone 
turned twords the door.  Masaki was the first to break the silance. "Sister!" She stood up.
"Where have you and Miss Washu been? We needed you to talk with us!"

	"Well, we needed to talk personally so we went up to the shrine. Alone." She sat 
down. "Miss Washu, I do beleive you have something to tell Miss Ryoko. Do you not?"

	"Ryoko? Come outside with me. I do need to tell you something." Ryoko stood up, and
walked up to Washu. "OK."

***********************************************************************************************


	"Ryoko, have a seat on the porch. You'll need to sit after I'm done telling you this.
It will be some disturbing, and maybe some good news."

	"Alright, so, tell me. Is this what you and Lady Funaho were speaking about?"

	"Yes, only, it will be up to you wether or not to tell the others."

	"Okay, okay. Just tell me already. I want to hurry this up before that storm hits."
Out-side, the clouds were turning dark, and the smell of rain was in the air.

	Washu gave Ryoko a sad look. <She's gonna take this hard. I bet she would rather stay
out in this storm than going back inside, knowing she's guilty of 'gonna have a baby of 
Tenchi's' when she goes back in-side, if she does.>

	"Ryoko, this is hard for me to say. You know I know what you and Tenchi did last-night,
right? Well, the efect of this is going to make you either angry, sad, or kind-of happy."
She let out a long sigh. "Ryoko, you're pregnet."

	"P-pre-pregnet? H-how can I be pre-pregnet? It was just last night! I can't belive.."
Then she gave Washu a distressed look, and ran off tords the shrine. "Ryoko! Wait!" The rain
started coming down, hard.  Washu was already soking-wet, so she ran in-side.

	"Miss Washu?" Ayeka was in the door-way. "Miss Washu, where is Ryoko? What did you say
to her? Wasn't she with you? She better not be in that rain."

	"Ayeka. Calm down." Yosho was just walking in. "Well, it seems that the storm is worse
than I thought. I think someone should at least go and get Miss Ryoko."

	"Brother Yosho. Why don't you go get her? Maybe she went to the shrine."

	"Yea, and why you're at it. You can tell her that Tenchi already knows. She ran away
before I had the chance to tell her." Washu had to say that he already knew, or else, it
would just be harder on her. Even though Tenchi has no clue, I sort'a erased that part of
his memory, he would be a nervous reck if he knew. Then she sighed & went into the house.

###############################################################################################


	Ryoko ran, and ran, and ran. As far as she could run. She didn't belive Washu. She
COULDN'T belive Washu. She was lieing. She knew it! It wasn't possible. How could that happen
THAT fast. But, then again. She wasn't human. NO! Washu was lieing! Ryoko was half way up the
shrine steps, when the rain got even harder then it already was. Ryoko stopped, and fell for-
ward on the steps. She couldn't stop crying. Tenchi probly hated her now!

	Ryoko's face was pressed on the hard, cold, and wet shrine steps. She was drenched, 
head t'toe. All of a sudden, she felt a hand on her shoulder. She looked up to see...Yosho?

	"Come. We must hurry to the shrine before this storm really gets bad."

	After he said that, he helped Ryoko up, and he and Ryoko hurried to the shrine.

Moments Later...


	Ryoko sat down on the floor to the shrine's office. Yosho found a nice and warm blanket,
and drapped it over her shoulders. He gave her a small cup of tea, and sat down himself.

	"Well, Miss Ryoko. What made you run-away in a storm like this for. Oh, and Miss Washu
told me to tell you that Tenchi already knows. What is it that he knows?" He noticed that Ryoko
was listening to him, but not answering him. "Ryoko. You know me well enough that I will not 
tell anyone what you tell me, and I will not judge you for what I think about what you say. Is
that alright?" She nodded. "Okay. Now please tell me. I may be able to tell some advice."

	She lifted her head so that she could see him, and said... "Last night, I accidently
got Tenchi drunk. he passed out, and so, I took him to his bed. I was gonna leave, but, he
stopped me. I woke up this morning," Long pause. "in his b-bed." Then she put her head back
down and sobbed. "Washu told me I was, she told me that last-night had an efect on me, and I.."

	"You needn't say anymore. I think I know what you mean now. I think you should just
go about during the day like you normally would, and when you start to show, you would find a
way to tell the others. I will not tell you anymore advice. I will tell Tenchi the same."
_______________________________________________________________________________________________


	Back at Tenchi's house, everyone was talking, and laughing. All except for Tenchi 
himself, who was just staring out in-to the world of nothingless.
	Masaki stopped talking and looked at Tenchi. "Earth-'t'-Teennchiii." Everyone-else
stopped what they were doing, and looked at Tenchi. Masaki waved her hand in-front of his face.
"Hellooow? Tenchi? Are you even in your own body?!"

	"Huh? What? What is it?" Tenchi snapped out of his trance. After he did, everone there
burst out in to laughter. "Oh! Tenchi! You should'of seen the look on your face!" Masaki was thee
loudest. "Ha! You were in your ooownnn liiittle wooorlld there for a moment!"

	"Mother," Ayeka was annoyed that Ryoko was the center of Tenchi's atention, she was sure
of it. Ryoko usualy embarassed Tenchi, now, her own mother was filling in the job! "don't be so
rash! You're enbarassing Lord Tenchi!" 
	Out-side, the storm was letting up, so Funaho suggested that they go out-side.
When they did get there, Yosho and Ryoko were just comeing down. Both sokeing wet from the 
earlier storm. The rest of the day was as any-other 'normall' day. Only thing was, Ryoko didn't
speak, nor hang-on to Tenchi, and Tenchi didn't talk, nor look at Ryoko. Ayeka knew something 
was up. Oh yea! Ryoko didn't fight with her, either!

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	The hot summer day was the hottest day anyone at the Misaki House-hold had ever had.
Mihoshi suggested swimming in the lake, and no-one could beleive that Mihoshi, THE DITZ, had
come up with a really good idea! So anyway, they went swimming. 
	It had only been half a week since Masaki and Funaho had arrived, so, Ryoko was half a
week pregnet, and not showing, yet. Everyone was either on the dock or in the water swimming.
Ryoko surprised everyone by wearing a one-piece batheing suit. (Swimming suit)

	So far, the only ones not in the water were Yosho, Funaho, Washu, Ryoko, and Tenchi.
Yes, Misaki was in the water, makeing Ayeka stay in the shalow water because 'she was her LITTLE
AYEKA!'

	Funaho had to speak with Washu and Yosho alone so, she asked if Ryoko and Tenchi to go
into the lake and swim. "Tenchi, Ryoko? Do you mind if I talk to Washu and my son Yosho for 
awhile. So, please, go into the water and swim a bit. It is way to hot to just sit around. Go."
	Tenchi stood up to go, but Ryoko was worried about geting too close to him. Tenchi 
looked back at her and hurried to jump in the water. Ryoko finally stood up and slowly walked to
the edge of the dock, posed, and jumped high into the air, and hit the water with a big splash.
	Funaho just looked at what took place and shook her head sadly. "This is what I needed
to talk to you about. Tenchi and Ryoko have to start talking to eachother, very soon. I'm afraid
of what might happen if they don't get along soon, I have this feeling one of them might do 
something that will devistate us all." Yosho nodded. "Yes, we must come up with a plan that will
 make it so they have no chioce but to start talking normally." Washu decided to come into the
conversation. "I'm sure that I already do have an idea that will DEFINATLY make it THAT way!"
Funaho and Yosho looked at Washu fearfuly, as she laughed like a MAD maniac...
(Spelling???)

XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx

	Kiyone threw the beachball to Ayeka. Ayeka threw it to Sasami. Sasami threw it to Tenchi.
Tenchi to Misaki. And Misaki trew the beachball to Ryoko. The ball went out of reach, and Ryoko
wasn't expecting the ball to go THAT far, and there was no wind...then the ball went farther,
to where no-one could even touch the ground, unless you were WAY taller than Mihishi's Head full
of hair. "Hey Ryoko. Go get it!" So, Ryoko being Ryoko, she went to the ball, half swimming, half 
flying.
	
	When she got to the ball, it MYSTERIOUSLY went under water. She went under to get it, 
but a VERY strong 'current' pulled her under deeper, way faster then a normall current would.
When able, she screamed. "HELP!" Then she went back under. Everyone was trying to find a way to
help Ryoko, but couldn't get to her because of 'some' invisable force. Tenchi was the only one
able to get to her, so he swam as fast as he could. But he was still hesitent.

	When he got there, He didn't see her, so he went under. He opened his eyes and finally
saw her. She was still trying to get to the surface. Tenchi dived and grabbed her at her waist.
He pulled her up and swam to the surface. When they got there, they were incredibly far away
from the shore.

	Tenchi and Ryoko looked at eachother and locked into a gaze. Their faces came closer and
closer until..."HEY TENCHI! ARE YOU AND RYOKO ALRIGHT?" They stopped and Tenchi sighed. "YEA!"

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	Washu cursed. "Why do people always have to get in the way of science!? They were at
THE perfect moment! Ahhhg!"

	"Washu. Please. At least they are, or at least they made up." Funaho sat and sighed.

	"Yea! But I was measuring their emotions! i need to know if Ryoko wanted to kiss him,
         and if Tenchi wanted to kiss her! GET IT!?"

	"Washu. Listen to Mother. Ther was no need."  Washu was angry, happy, and surpised.
Yosho almost raised his voice at her! 

	Funaho stood up and put a hand on Washu's shoulder. "Come. Let us go into the house.
COME EVERYONE! LET US GO INTO THE HOUSE AND EAT SOMETHING, THEN MAYBE WATCH A MOVIE!"
Washu could tell she had other ways to get Tenchi and Ryoko together, by means of a movie. They
did make some progress. Ryoko walked by Tenchi on the way back. Tenchi was woudering why Ryoko 
didn't bother him.



To Be Continued...
