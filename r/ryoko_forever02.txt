Ok on to the fan fiction:

--------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 2: "The Duel with The Red Eyed Demon"

--------------------------------------------------------------

Sasami starts waking up everyone for breakfast.

"Ryoko, Kiyone, Mihoshi, Aeka, Washu, Tenchi" Sasami yelled, 
"Breakfast is ready."

--------------------------------------------------------------

<Should I go get Tenchi?> Ryoko thought in her room.

<He did seem very angry with me last time. > Ryoko decided not to.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile in Tenchi's room....

<She's not here today?> Tenchi thought.
<Maybe I am still dreaming> 

He dressed and went down, to avoid a fight he sneaked out to do his chores in the field.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko, deciding not to get Tenchi teleported to the kitchen.

"Good Ryoko your here could you go and get some supply of potatoes from the storage?"
Sasami said nicely to Ryoko.

Ryoko's face faulted,
"Ok..Sasami I will be right back"
<Why me? I should have slept late.>

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko reached the store closet and started getting the potatoes.

Suddenly the RED eyes flashed again.
Ryoko didn't see this but she sensed it.

She yelled to where she sensed it,
"Show yourself"

The RED eyes flashed and an unimaginable demon stepped out.

Ryoko took a small step back and prepared for battle.
She changed to her battle uniform. Light saber in handy.

The demon and Ryoko where ready to battle when...

--------------------------------------------------------------

"Does anyone of you know where Lord Tenchi is?" Aeka said with anxiety.

"No, Aeka, I sent Ryoko to the store house to get potatoes, and she isn't here yet"
Sasami answered.

"O..Oo I hope that monster women is not with Lord Tenchi, I better go check" Aeka said angrily.

Aeka stepped outside and started to head to the storehouse...

<Just wait until I get my hands on that Ryoko....>
"Lord Tenchi?" Aeka said as she saw Tenchi moving toward the lake.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Ryoko saw Tenchi approching the battleground.

"Ryoko what is going on here?" Tenchi asked questionly.
He saw the demon and took a step back,
"W..What's that?"

"I am not too sure,” Ryoko answered.

The demon started to make a move for Tenchi.

"Tenchi get out of here!" Ryoko yelled quickly.

The demon paid no attention to Ryoko's outburst, and Tenchi stood horrified not moving.

The Demon blasted a large energy ball aimed for Tenchi.

"Tenchi!" Ryoko yelled.

Ryoko quickly teleported to Tenchi and picked him up and teleported again.
Ryoko looked at the spot that Tenchi had been in thinking that she is going to get revenge.

Tenchi in the mean time recovered from the shock,
he looks at Ryoko.

"That was close" Ryoko said with a note of seriousness.

"That’s for sure" is all Tenchi could say.
<She..Risked her life.> Tenchi thought in confusion.

Ryoko placed Tenchi on the beach of the lake,
and said.
"Get out of here Tenchi"

<Why is she doing this for me?> Tenchi thought.

"What do you want with us?" Ryoko yelled while in combat.

"Me... I want nothing...my master he wants...YOU,” The demon yelled.

"What?" Ryoko said in shock.

Ryoko shot a rather powerful energy ball at him but it didn't work.
The demon had a force field. It looks like Ryoko will have to charge at the demon.

Ryoko just stood in mid-air for a moment. She put her hand to her waist.
<This is really getting to me>

Tenchi was watching from the lake...
<She's hurt?> <The demon barely even touched her. *OhMyGod* is that from yesterday?>
<She looks hurt badly what can I do?>

--------------------------------------------------------------

<She saved Lord Tenchi> Aeka thought approaching the battleground.

"Ryoko, what’s going on here?" Aeka questioned at Ryoko.

"How am I supposed to know? This 'thing' just attacked me." Ryoko yelled back while still in combat.

The demon took the opportunity while Ryoko was talking to fire an energy ball.
Ryoko turned around to face the demon. She just narrowly missed getting hit.

"That's it you are going to pay for ever challenging me!" Ryoko said proudly to the demon.

Ryoko carefully took aim and charged with her light saber toward the demon.
She killed it.

she looked at the demon and looked satisfied.
She looked toward the lake and saw Tenchi and Aeka looking at her.
<Tenchi didn't leave why not? Why is that Aeka here?>

She flew down to Tenchi and said, "Well come on should we go to breakfast, Sasami is waiting"

To be continued...........
