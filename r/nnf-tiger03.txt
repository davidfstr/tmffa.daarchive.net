Legalities blah blah blah. Tenchi Muyo! is owned by AIC and Pioneer 
Animations. I created Raikon Jurai, Saikyou, Xeresei, and Lord Tatsao. 
My friend, Liz Holt, created Akina and Yukio. Now on with the story. 
Enjoy!
Please note that a month or so has gone by between the end of chapter 2 
and the present time in the fic.
***********************************************************************

	"Kiyone? Kiyone. Kiyone, my dear, wake up." Kiyone was drowsily 
waken up by Raikon's pleasant voice. "*yawn* Huh?" She looked up at him 
with a smile. "What is it my prince?"
"Well, it's time for a quick breakfast and then we're heading off to the 
construction site."
"Alright. So what's for breakfast?" "I've decided to give Sasami a break 
and I made...
My Universe Famous Eggs and some hot, green tea. Yours I just finished."
"Oh, great! Thank you!" She wrapped her arms around his neck and pecked 
him on the lips." "Don't metion it. That was thanks enough. Well we 
better get going, we don't want your food to get cold." Kiyone hugged 
him tightly before she rushed out the door. 
"Good girl." He intangiated through the floor just in time to give 
Kiyone her breakfast.
"Tha-" Instead, she blew him a kiss. He grinned. "How's everyone liking 
the food?"
"It's delicious!" everyone replied. "Good as always, big brother." 
"Thanks lil' brother."
Sasami piped in, "This recipe seems familiar, somehow." "It does doesn't 
it?" Ayeka said.
"But they were never this good..." Ayeka, startled, dropped her utensil. 
"Sister?" "You-you-you really are my brother...These are Eggs Raikonia."
"And this convinced you that he's your brother?!" Ryoko practically 
yelled. "*sigh* Well that's Ayeka for you...Look at 'im! He looks like a 
male, muscular Misaki!!!"
Ayeka tilted her head at Raikon. "Uh...I guess your right..."
"And, Ayeka," Kiyone began, "look at his eyes...They are the same color 
as the...yes..the Royal Teardrop...And how lovely they are.."
"O Contrare, your beautiful, sparkling, Turquoise jewels are 
incapacitating..."
They sighed together. They found themselves in the same position as when 
they were at the Karaoke Place. But unlike then, they didn't back away 
from each other.
Tenchi looked to his grandfather. "She's in love." "Yes...Too bad...She 
was the only sane one here. Ha ha ha!" Raikon suddenly appeared behind 
Yosho.
"You do realize I am your elder. By 77 minutes, but your elder 
nonetheless..."
"Okay, I get the point. I'll shut up now. Ha ha ha!"
Raikiyo resumed hugging and holding. He peered down at her wrist 
communicator. "Um...honey?" "Hm?" "Look at your watch."  
"Hmm..?" Kiyone's rapture quickly changed to suprise. "Oh my God! 
Mihoshi! Let's go!" Bye guys!" "Good-bye everyone!" Mihoshi piped in. 
Raikon smiled divinely and said, "Adieu." They ran out the door and left 
in Saikyou.
Ryoko looking at the open door said, "He's a charmer...Hmm...she's so 
lucky..Don't you think so, Tenchi?" "Ryoko, he's my great uncle...I 
guess so." Ryoko dissapeared then reappeared hanging off Tenchi. "I'm 
right. And I'm lucky too. I've got my Tenchi!"
"Wait a second, Ryoko. Who's Tenchi?"  
The Fuschia-haired scientist sighed. "Back to normal...I think..."

	"Okay. Mihoshi, pay attention. When the load reaches five meters 
to the hole, you need to tell the driver to stop. Got it?" "Um...I think 
so..." "Oh boy. Okay, I'll help you."
Raikon calmly walked behind Mihoshi, pulled her up to himself, and 
grabbed her hands. Mihoshi giggled. "Okay,  now keep the director 
straight and move your hands and the director in a summoning motion." 
"Hee hee, okay." He molded her hands in the fashion required. "As I said 
before, when it gets five meters away from the hole, you turn the 
director inwards and turn your palm out...see?" "Like this?" "Good work. 
Just like that."
Mihoshi ran over to Kiyone just as she was halting another truck. "What 
is it Mihoshi?" "Did you see that? He's really great! You're so lucky!" 
Kiyone's eye glimmer in dreaminess. "I am...aren't I?" "Yeah, and when 
he was holding my hands, I thought I felt electricity!" "Yeah...I 
noticed that too....when I kiss him.."
Raikon, directing a machine commanded, "Take it to the left, to the 
left...now up and bring it on in..slowly, slowly, slowly...stop! There, 
good."
The Teal tressed goddess, at the same time began directing a crane. 
"Okay, now bring it up and to the right, and turn...there! Is it tight 
up there? Unlock the cable and bring it around."
"Lemme see. Uh...back, back, back, back, now stop. Yay! I did it! And I 
didn't mess up once!" 
The chief operator walked up to Kiyone. "Hey, Kiyone, who's your friend? 
He's a miricle worker. Mihoshi actually did a job without screwing up!" 
"No...He's more than that...He is a miricle...period. 
Huh? Mihoshi didn't screw up? Whoa..."
"You guys did a good job today...I..." The chief operator stumbled as 
Raikon popped up behind Kiyone. "Thank you, girls. And thank you very 
much, sir." 
"Mm-hmm...No problem. Let's go eat our lunches and we can do something 
before our next job." 
"Yeah, alright," Kiyone said. "But you know what's odd? We haven't been 
on call for a while...But I'm actually kinda glad that we haven't." 
Kiyone and Mihoshi happily ate their lunch, and Kiyone recieving a 
gentle but amourously firm massage from the hands of Raikon Jurai.
"Hey I've got an idea!" Mihoshi said cheerily. "Why don't we go to the 
carousel down at the square?" "Sounds like fun," Raikon replied. 
	They looked among the steeds upon arrival. Mihoshi chose a black 
stallion with a blond mane. Raikiyo chose partnered steeds. Kiyone's was 
a powder-white equine with Sapphire colored hair and purple eyes. 
Raikon's was an orange-red horse with hair and eyes Aquamarine both. 
They rode, side by side, galantly, incredibly fluid; together...the 
perfect pair...

	Kiyone greeted the first customer. "Hello sir, how may I help 
you?" "Uh...could I get...
a double cheeseburger and a medium chocolate shake please?" "Very good 
sir. Would you like fries with that?" "Sure, yeah."
"Welcome, what's your pleasure today, sir?" Raikon said. "Give me a 
Fried Terriaki Chicken Club Special." "Excellent choice sir! What drink 
would you like with that?" "Um..A Coke please." "FTCCS with a Coke. 
Alright."
"What can I serve you today?" "Just a...a coffee and a pokchop burger." 
"Oh yummy! Anything else?" "No, thank you." "Okay. One porkchop burger 
and a coffee."
Kiyone walked over to Raikon. "Hey Raikon, could you help me in the 
backroom?" 
"Okay. Sure." "Thanks." As he followed her into the backroom, she closed 
the door.
"We're finally alone...," Kiyone said with a grin. Raikon smoothly 
looked up with his powerful smile. She swung her arms around Raikon's 
neck and hugged him tightly. He reached down and lightly brushed his 
hands up and down her lower back.
 She moaned and nuzzled her cheek against his. They sensuously locked 
lips...
The two Galaxy Police officers shared each others warm mouths and soft 
tongues.
Suddenly, the door whooshed open with Mihoshi in the doorway.
"Mihoshi! You suprised us..." "You could have knocked," Raikon said 
straightening his shirt.
"Really..," Kiyone added fluffing her jacket.
"Hee hee...I'm sure glad I bought that soundless camera!" "Soundless 
camera?! Mihoshi...!"
Raikon combed his hand through her hair and cooed, "Don't get mad at 
her. She's a ditz. She can't help it." "Okay," Kiyone replied, her eyes 
sparkling.
"Oh. There's a customer at my register," he said. "Hi there, miss. What 
can I do for you today?" "For starters you could take me to dinner and 
then a movie...You're cute..."
"Uh...he he..." "Hey girl! Back off! He's MY MAN!!!" "Gggnnghh!!" 
"That's my Kiyone...heh heh..." Kiyone found herself growling and 
panting. [Oh no. I'm acting like Ayeka and Ryoko!] That's frightening." 
	All three of them changed back into uniform, ready to go back 
home. "Hey, Mihoshi. Go ahead in Saikyou and jet over to Tenchi's. We'll 
just fly there." "...Okay..."
Raikiyo watched as Saikyou lifted off.
"Kiyone. Jump up on my back. We're going somewhere." She leaped onto his 
back and held tightly at his neck as Raikon began to float from the 
ground. 
Raikon flew upon the air pockets and thermals, the warm, pillars of air, 
not even needing them as he jetted through the sky.
"This is wonderful." "I'm glad you like it, my dear. We're almost there 
now." "Where? Tenchi's house?" "Nope...Look down there..." 
"Oh...my...You're so wonderful!" "No, that would be you." "Mmmm!!!" 
Kiyone rubbed her soft, teal hair on his throat. She kissed the nape of 
his neck and went around and kissed up his trachea to his ear. She 
stirred at his ear slowly and softly with her tongue as the began to 
near the ground below. 

	Nearly twenty minutes later, Raikon and Kiyone land in front of 
the Masaki House.
*KNOCK KNOCK*
Sasami welcomed them. "You guys! You're finally back! We have a suprise 
for you!" "Suprise?" Raikon questioned. Kiyone shrugged. As they 
continued forward, they heard Ayeka tell Ryoko, "This picture really 
shows their compatability! Ha ha ha!" "Yeah...ha ha ha!!" 
Of course, Washu had to put in her two cents. "Did you notice his 
physilogical analysis?
Hee hee!" They also hear other women laughing. And then a man sigh, "Oh 
boy."
Raikiyo, knowingly blushed. "Okay now," Raikon said, "what's the 
suprise?" 
Funaho stood up, her black hair swaying. "Long time...Huh, Raikon?" 
Kiyone gasped. 
"Mother?! Oh...my...my..mother!" He ran up and hugged his maternal 
parent. 
"How's my oldest nephew?" "Uh, Misaki! Great to see you!" She glared up 
at him with a devilish smile. "That's Aunt Misaki to you heartbreaker." 
"Right. Yes ma'am."
"Hmm..son. So how are things?" Azusa said. "Just peachy, father. I 
presume you all know Kiyone Makibi...right?" She smiled. Misaki, Azusa, 
and Funaho all replied, "Yes."
"Well do you know Kiyone Makibi Jurai?" Kiyone pointed out the ring. 
"We're engaged."
Funaho walked up to her. "Wow. It's a Blue Tearnet...Impressive, 
Raikon...My boy was never cheap." Misaki hastily ran up and grabbed 
Kiyone. "Oh you're so lucky! I'm so happy for you, niece!" Azusa standed 
forward saying, "Ah, good choice, my boy." The short, pink-haired genius 
gave them her blessings as well. "Wow. Good luck you two."
Sasami was excited, too. "Wow! Isn't this great, Ayeka! Ayeka?" Ayeka 
and Ryoko fixed their eyes on Tenchi. "Tenchi, let's get married, okay? 
Huh? Grrr..." The Bubblehead also had something to say. "Great, Kiyone! 
I even have a wedding present for you!" She hands Kiyone an oil 
painting-sized photograph of the infamous "backroom-picture."
"Thanks a lot...ya ditz." "You're welcome!" She answered cheerily. 
"Huh?" 
Tenchi was the last to say, "Well, great-uncle Raikon, you have made a 
good choice. She truely is a wonderful girl." "I know." Raikon looked 
over to Yosho. "Not going to say anything?" 
Hmm...Good luck big brother...sister in law." 
Ayeka approached Kiyone. "That is an impressive rock, sister...Come with 
me." 
"Um...okay... Be back, baby." They cradled hands and quickly pecked one 
another's lips. "Alright. Always yours." "Always yours." Ayeka and 
Kiyone climbed up the stairs.
There is silence.
"You know," Ryoko began, "she really is the most sane person I know." 
Everyone still downstairs laughed.

*CLICK-KA-CLICK*
Ayeka turned back towards Kiyone from the now locked door.  
"Good. Now, as a Royal Queen of Jurai, you will need to know some 
techniques."  
"...."
"Leather restraints are useful. They hold well and are tight fitting as 
well as comfortable. These whips can allow for easy deference and will 
cause him to beg for more! Ha ha ha ha!!!" 
Ayeka recollected herself. "Ahem. I heard from Aunt Funaho that Raikon 
enjoys the 
candle wax factor. That is quite the sexual stimulator. Hmm...My brother 
enjoys the exitement that hot wax can create...Remember that. And you 
will need the proper leather suit, Kiyone, so-"
"Wait. Funaho took me through the training already and I had bought 
myself a suit." Kiyone dug around through a duffel bag. "Ah, here it 
is." She pulled out a vibrant, red and gold suit. The "Evil-Kiyone" 
suit. "Very nice, Kiyone! I must say!" "Thanks. I have my own whip too." 
"And Funaho taught you the techniques, right?" "Yeah. During their last 
visit. She taught me as a joke, that's all. Oh, and here are the 
restraints!" "Wow. Okay. Well, manual intercourse is fine, but you 
should train the masculine at the honeymoon...At the very least." "Yes. 
I know. Well there will be plenty of heathy sex. Believe you me. I know 
he can deliver." "I imagine so." "And I'm to be dominating generally? If 
I remember right, fluxuation was more commonly advised." "Yes, quite 
right. I'm proud to call you 'sister', Kiyone." "So am I." 
"You have candles I presume..." "Yes, Ayeka. Quite a few. I have a few 
white ones, some black ones, and a couple of blue ones. And recently, I 
bought some others: two orange ones, two gold ones, a couple of red 
ones, and two nice turquoise candles and a single Royal Teardrop 
candle."
"Amazing! That must have been hard to find." "Whew. Oh yes, it was." 
"Well that's it, I guess... I'm sad to say this but, you will be the 
next emperess of Jurai...*sob*..." Kiyone rested a comforting hand on 
Ayeka's shoulder. "No I won't. Not until you get married as well...And I 
think I'd like to stay in the GP." "Okay. Thank you, sister. I may be 
697  years older than you- although I do look more like twenty, huh?- 
but you are wise beyond your years, Kiyone."
"Thank you, Ayeka. You know, your brother seems only a couple of years 
older than myself. But his is centuries old...And 77 minutes older than 
Yosho." "Ah...Sister..." "Let's go back out there...They might be 
wondering why were gone for so long." "Yes....So, Funaho taught you, 
Kiyone?" "Yeah...The whole thing was...quite interesting."

	As they left the room, they were greeted by laughter. Funaho stood 
up and walked towards Kiyone. "Ah...My daughter. I have a gift for you." 
She pulls a 44 centimeter long, Royal Teardrop candle. Funaho chuckled. 
Kiyone smiled. "Thank you, mother...*wink*"
"No problem. *wink* He he!"  Tench was confused. "What's with girls and 
candles?" Azusa, Yosho, and Raikon all replied, "I have no idea..." 
Raikon being the only one smiling.
Funaho sat back on the ground and upon comfort, Misaki whispered, 
"You're right sister, he does seem that he would enjoy the techniques. I 
can see it in his eyes." 
Washu walked up to Raikon. "I have the Daga Tearnets you wanted, 
Raikon." "Great. Much obliged, little Washu." "Don't mention it!" Raikon 
used his telekinesis to bring the gems to him.
He smiled. "Very good quality..." With a Daga Tearnet in each palm, he 
charged an orb of energy into each. The two stones shattered and then 
recompiled and fused into two, lovely, strong rings. "There we are...The 
wedding bands." Kiyone's eyes shimmered and were bright, twin moons. 
"Oh...my...They-they're beautiful!" "Just like you, my love." He stroked 
her jaw. She blushed, but wasn't sure why. [Probably because of all of 
these people...But I don't care...When I'm with Raikon...nothing else 
matters...just us...rapture...Maybe we jumped into this too soon...I 
mean, we hardly know each other...And now...We're getting married...I 
only met him a few weeks ago...But it feels like it was meant to 
be...Yes we are to be together...]
Just then, Ryo-Ohki, whom must have been ill in spirits for they haven't 
heard off her for a few days, hopped next to them. "Hmm? Ryo-Ohki? Would 
you like to be our ring bearer, girl?" Raikon asked the cabbit. She 
replied in approval at the position with a cheery, "Meow!!"
"Good." Kiyone sighed and turned to Ayeka. "I'm sorry, Ayeka, but if I 
don't do this, she'll whine about it until hell freezes over. Okay? 
Mihoshi, would you like to be my maid of honor?" 
"Oh? Really?! Yay!!! Sure I'll be your maid of honor, Kiyone! I'm so 
excited!" "Hopeless..." Raikon turned to his younger brother. "Yosho, 
would you be my best man?" "Of course.You know I'd be delighted." Kiyone 
pondered on another position whos perscription would not be hard to fill 
out. "I think Sasami would make an excellent flower girl." "Alright! 
I'll do that then! It's my pleasure!" Raikon decided on the station for 
the ushers. "Tenchi, Nobuyuki. Will you two be the ushers?" The replied 
with a delighted, "Okay, Uncle Raikon." Tenchi blinked.
"That felt a little weird..." The Teal tressed goddess turned to the 
proposed second and third bridesmaid. "Ayeka and Ryoko. Would you two 
take on the third and second bridesmaids?" 
"I'd love to." "Well, that takes care of that....Um...Washu? What would 
you like to do?" 
"Lemme play the music!" Kiyone looked over to Raikon. "Hmm....Okay..." 
"But nothing to weird," he finished. "Awww!!! Okay!" Everyone laughed. 
Misaki whispered over to her sister again. "Uh...Sister? 
How..exactly...do you know that he likes the techniques? Especially 
the... candles?" "Oh...heh...Well, he so happened to discover a training 
book in one of the libraries, and he asked me, 'This is what intercourse 
includes in the sexual aspects of Juraian women? Interesting... The 
candle wax innuendo is quite interesting. Ha. Here..."...a training of 
men in the ways of love." Kawaii...' That's how...," she explained, with 
a devilish smile.
"Wow...We've got a good boy here, sister...as well as his fiance." 
"Yes...so true...
So true..." Raikon turned to Tenchi. "So, Tenchi. Shall we train some 
more? Before it gets too late." 
"Yeah, let's go. You know, It'll be strange calling Kiyone 'Great-Aunt.' 
Ha ha ha."
