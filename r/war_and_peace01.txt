INTRODUCTION:  With the coming of the third OAV (finally), I was a little 
discouraged about writing my own third OAV speculatory fic.  But I then realized 
that one of the main appeals of Tenchi fic writing is the infinite possibilities 
that it allows.  So yes, I am going to use a character name from the third OAV, 
and yes, the story will involve Tokimi, but everything else will be of my 
design.  If anything in the third OAV ends up resembling what I have written it 
is purely coincidental.  I guess I just thought along the same lines as Masaki 
Kajishima.  I will also refrain from using Japanese terms and words unless they 
are obviously known, because while some of us know them, others do not, and they 
must be considered.  And I know Kiyone shouldn't technically be in the OAV 
timeline, but I'm using her anyway.  OK, without further ado, here is my epic.  
I hope you enjoy it.

TENCHI MUYO!: WAR AND PEACE
A FANFIC BY IAN SAGAT

"Every generation has a legend, every journey has a first step, every saga has a 
beginning..."
	-STAR WARS: EPISODE I

CHAPTER 1: REUNIONS (Part I)

	Tenchi barely brought up his sword in time, the blue shaft of light 
emanating from the Master Key stopping Ryoko's red energy blade only a few 
inches from his head. Sweat beaded from his brow and the light from the swords 
danced in his eyes.  Ryoko's eyes, however, glowed a fierce red, a grimace of 
rage snarled across her face.  He mustered his strength and pushed her back with 
a grunt.  She was hovering a few inches from the ground, and readied her sword 
for the counterattack she knew was coming.  Tenchi lunged forward and slashed, 
finding only air.  He swung to his left and slashed again, this time finding 
Ryoko's blade in a parry.  He slashed and thrusted several more times, Ryoko 
dodging or parrying each blow with increasing difficulty, her face furrowed with 
anger.  He let one more hard slash go at waist level, but Ryoko took off 
straight into the air.  Tenchi looked up at her.  "Not this time!" he yelled as 
he leapt an insane distance straight up, catching up to Ryoko high above the 
ground.  He brought his blade down, and this time Ryoko was the one to barely 
stop Tenchi's sword from cleaving her head in two.  He let loose a war cry and 
pushed her back down towards the ground at blinding speed.  Just then, Ayeka 
entered the courtyard.  She looked up in terror.  "Lord Tenchi!"
	Tenchi looked up at her, and Ryoko, seeing his distraction, took 
advantage.  At the last second she teleported, and Tenchi slashed hard into the 
ground, sending up debris and dust.  He looked up but was nearly blind from the 
cloud.  Out of his peripheral vision he caught movement, but it was too late.  
He felt Ryoko's shoulder bury itself into his ribs, knocking him to the ground 
and the sword from his hand.  He landed hard on his back, winded.  His vision 
cleared and he saw Ryoko leap into the air, sword back and pointed down, eyes on 
fire and screaming a banshee wail.  He looked over; the sword was out of reach.  
Summoning his Jurai Power, he willed to the sword to his hand, and it flew to 
him.  Tenchi activated the sword and brought it up, palm of his other hand in 
the hilt's back, just as Ryoko landed and thrusted down.  Ayeka screamed and 
looked away.  But then there was silence.  She slowly looked up at them.  Tenchi 
was on his back, leaning up, with the sword blade held so it was an inch from 
Ryoko's neck.  Ryoko leaned over him, energy blade held an inch from piercing 
his heart.  All that could be heard was the humming of the blades.  Tenchi's 
brow was furrowed and sweaty as he glared at his opponent.  Then his face 
softened and a smirk formed.  "I had you that time, Ryoko." he said. Ryoko's 
face formed a smirk of it's own, feral yellow eyes looking down at him.  "Looks 
like another stalemate, lover."
	The blades extinguished and Ryoko held out her hand.  Tenchi took it and 
rose up.  The two embraced, noses touching.  "Did I hurt you?" Ryoko asked, 
nuzzling him.  
	"Not really.  You must be getting old." he teased back.
	"What?  Well, your no spring chicken either, tough guy." She retorted.  
Suddenly there was a third party present next to them.
	"One of these days you two are going to hurt each other.  You scared the 
life out of me just now." Ayeka said, as the two pulled back from each other.
	"I'm sorry Ayeka, but Ryoko's the only sparring partner that can give me 
any challenge anymore, you know that." He said as he holstered his sword, took 
her hands and kissed her lightly on the lips.
	"Yeah, Princess, I gotta thank you for the assist.  He almost had me." 
Ryoko added.  Ayeka eyed her for a second, then smiled and moved next to her, 
taking her arm. 
	"Yes, we do have to keep him on his toes, don't we? The King of Jurai must 
be able to vanquish all enemies, foreign AND domestic." she said, as they both 
looked at him sarcastically and smiled.  Tenchi looked at them and smiled back.
	"And what better teacher than The Captain of the Royal Guard?" Ryoko 
added.
	"You two are always teaming up on me, aren't you?  Just like women to 
stick together." He snorted.  He walked in between them and took each one by the 
arm.  "Shall we?" he asked as they began to walk.
	"I know another event we can team up on..." Ryoko said evilly, a lustful 
smile on he face as she looked at Tenchi.  Ayeka "hmphed".
	"Twenty years of marriage and you still can't get enough, can you? Well, 
it'll have to wait; Shen is back from The Galactic University, along with your 
mother.  They're waiting in the Throne Room." Tenchi and Ryoko looked at each 
other and beamed.  It had been nearly 6 months since they'd seen their son in 
person, and nearly a year since Washu had paid a visit.  Their schedules were 
hellacious, Shen studying Diplomacy, Washu teaching all manner of advanced 
classes as well as heading up the faculty.  Running an empire didn't leave a lot 
of time on their side either.  
	"Kirei is already heading there.  Let's hurry." Ayeka said, happiness in 
her voice.  The trio passed through the entrance to the sparring yard, a palace 
guard on each side.  They snapped to attention.
	"How long that time, Ashitaka?" Tenchi asked one of the guards.
	"Seven minutes, 13 seconds, your highness.  A fine fight.  I'll have the 
groundskeepers repair the damage." the guard, a burly man, replied.
	"Thank you." all three of them replied as they walked by.

	Shen stood at the foot of the mammoth painting of his parents, sitting on 
their thrones.  He was a lean, tall, handsome man of 18 years, with pale skin, 
sharp features, and long, straight black hair.  He also had his mother's 
pronounced ears, not to mention canines.  His yellow eyes traced the ornate 
frame.  His outfit was also completely black, save for a red belt.
	"Brother!  I missed you!" a voice called from behind.  He turned and 
smiled at his half-sister.  Kirei was beautiful by any standards, thin, tall, 
and fair.  Her shoulder-length purple hair fell loosely, her crimson eyes shone.  
She was very voluptuous up top, pronounced even more by her slender build and 
tight white dress she wore.  The siblings embraced.
	"It's been far too long." he said with a voice deeper and smoother than 
one would expect.  "You cut your hair."
	"And you've grown yours." she replied, looking up at her slightly taller 
brother.  "How's school?"
	Shen sighed.  "A little too much, sometimes.  There are so many different 
cultures and laws in our empire; it seems impossible to learn them all.  But I'm 
doing well."
	"With a little help from The Greatest Scientific Genius in the Universe!" 
a very familiar voice called from behind them.  Kirei spun around and smiled 
widely.  "Grandma Washu!" she left her brother to embrace the much shorter, 
child-like Washu.  Washu smiled and kissed her cheek.  "So how's life treatin' 
ya?  Ready for the Galaxy Police yet?" 
	"Yeah!  Palace life is so boring! One more month and I'll be eighteen, and 
then it's off to the academy!  I can't wait to meet all the cute boys there!"
	"Well, anyone who wants to court my sister will have to go through ME 
first, of course." replied her brother, now standing next to them.
	"Not to mention me!  I gotta make sure he's handsome enough!" added Washu.
	"Oh, knock it off you two, I'm a big girl." she said as they all shared a 
laugh.
	"You know, being a Princess of Jurai could have probably gotten you in 
earlier." Shen said.
	"I know, but I don't want any special treatment while I'm there, not even 
for this.  I want to earn my way just like everyone else." she asserted.  
	"Very admirable sis, but what is the point of being royalty if you can't 
be treated special?"  he added.
	"That's your mother talking. Speaking of which, where is my little girl?"
	**"Right here."** a voice echoed in Washu's mind.  She turned to see her 
daughter walking with her husband and the other Queen of Jurai.  They were a 
lovely sight in their Royal Juraian garb.  Tenchi had grown some in the past 20 
years since being on Earth, but not a lot.  The Juraian blood in him, plus the 
close proximity to the Juraian Space Trees had slowed his aging to a snail's 
pace.  He only looked two or three years older, but now wore his hair in a 
longer, thicker ponytail.  He had worn a goatee or beard in the past, but lost 
it after constant badgering from his wives.  Ryoko looked exactly the same as 
always, as she never ages, and Ayeka was the same as well, being pure long-lived 
Jurain Royalty.  All three were much more regal in the way the styled and 
composed themselves, however.  Ayeka also had a single green dot on her 
forehead, symbolizing her as the "First Queen" of Jurai, while Ryoko had two 
dots next to each other for "Second Queen".
	"Well, well, long time no see guys!" Washu exclaimed as she walked up the 
trio.  She poked Ryoko's breasts.  "Still sagging, I see."
	"Still annoying I see." Ryoko answered, hugging her mom.  Tenchi and Ayeka 
giggled, then hugged her in turn.  Washu sneaked a pinch on Tenchi's butt.
	"Hey you! Hands off my husband! Get your own!" Ryoko yelled, smacking 
Washu's hand.  Ayeka laughed, Tenchi just looked embarrassed.
	"Father, mother." greeted Shen, standing ten feet away.  He bowed his 
head.  They stood silent for several seconds.  "Well, don't just stand there, 
give us a hug!" Ryoko finally yelled.  He walked up and hugged his mother, and 
they kissed each other on the cheek.  Ayeka then did the same, and then he stood 
before his father.  Tenchi put his hands on his son's shoulders.  "I missed you.  
And I'm proud.  I'm glad you came."
	"I couldn't very well miss my parents' 20 year anniversary, now could I?" 
he replied.  Then they hugged forcefully, Tenchi patting his back.
	They all sat in the enormous throne room, catching up on what everyone had 
been doing, plans for the future, trading stories and jokes, for what seemed 
like hours.  Every once in a while, Ryoko and Washu would have a mental 
conversation, probably about Ryoko's sex life by the looks on their faces, 
Tenchi thought.  Tenchi and Shen talked a long time about sparring techniques as 
well.  Eventually, Washu asked the obvious question.  "So, when's the rest of 
'em getting here?"
	"Kiyone and Mihoshi should be here later today, their patrol fleet was 
pretty far out.  I sent a ship for grandpa, dad, and Mayuka, and they should be 
here tomorrow.  Sasami is tied up in a trade dispute in the outer sector, she 
doesn't know if she and Ryo-Ohki can make it.  Funaho and Misaki were on the 
other side of the planet hosting a Royal Marriage ceremony, and are on their way 
back now." Tecnhi explained.
	"That's too bad, I haven't seen Sasami in ages." Washu said.
	"Yes, I miss Aunt Sasami as well." Kirei added.  Just then a female 
servant entered.
	"My lord, dinner is ready." she said as she bowed.
	"Thank you.  Alright, let's eat!" Tenchi exclaimed.  The group then left 
for the banquet hall.  Unbeknownst to them, a pair of figures watched from a 
parapet on the opposite side of the throne room.
	"Soon they will all be together again." one of them spoke. 
	"They are quite powerful together.  The King alone is formidable in his 
own right.  You recall last time?" the other answered.
	"Of course.  But this time Her Majesty herself has sent an envoy.  With 
our help, he cannot fail."
	"We have waited so long.  Soon, things will be right again."

	The banquet hall, like almost every other room in the Jurai Royal Palace, 
was an enormous, with wooden walls and high ceiling ornately designed and 
crafted from the dried sap of the Royal Space Trees.  The table could seat 50, 
but held only the small group clustered at one end, Tenchi sitting at the head 
and Ryoko and Ayeka on either side.  Juraian and Japanese dishes, as well as a 
few foreign cuisines covered the table around the happily chattering family.  
Tenchi changed the subject from the anniversary celebration preparations to his 
son's well being.
	"So Little Washu, has Shen been behaving at school?" asked Tenchi.
	"Oh yeah, he's a model student, too bad he avoids my classes like the 
Versonion Plague." Washu replied, nudging Shen with her elbow.
	"I'm sorry grandmother, but Physics, Xeno-Biology and Temporal Dynamics 
have very little to do with diplomacy.  It's nothing personal." He answered.
	"Yeah, well, the instructors he does have love him, and I see him around 
the grounds a lot, and he always has a couple of gorgeous gals on his arm!" 
Washu exclaimed with a mouthful of rice.  Shen blushed noticeably. 
	"He takes after his old man." Ryoko said proudly, shooting a look and 
smirk at Tenchi.  Now Tenchi blushed.
	"Oh come on now, I never had gorgeous girls on my arm everywhere I went.  
I mean, no girls paid me any attention until you and Ayeka came along." Tenchi 
explained.
	"Well that explains why you were so hard to get.  You were so clueless 
back then Tenchi, it was very frustrating.", Ayeka added.
	"Yeah, ya big fat-head. We were practically throwing ourselves at you and 
you were like, DUH!" Ryoko said, emphasizing the "DUH!" by pointing her finger 
at her head and sticking out her tongue.  Now Tenchi felt he had to defend 
himself.
	"Well, it's not like I could pay attention to that while you and Ayeka 
blew up my house fighting over me all the time." He said with a smirk.  Kirei 
looked up with anticipation.
	"Alright! Mom and Ryoko fight stories! These are always good!" she 
giggled.  The Juraian Queens laughed.
	"Yes, we were quite the rivals back then, right Ryoko?" Ayeka asked her 
now-best friend.
	"Oh yeah.  We had some good fights.  Remember the time I summoned that 
demon at the onsen and forgot I couldn't control it?" Ryoko said with a smile as 
she ate a piece of Sushi.  Ayeka smiled back.
	"One of our first.  How could I forget.  It took us two weeks to fix that 
place up." Ayeka answered.  Everyone shared a laugh, except Shen.
	"But as I recall, I heard you cared for each other, even back then.  
Kagato, Clay, Yuzuha, Heigl, you helped each other many times even as you both 
fought for father's affections.  As I see it, the outcome you eventually came to 
was inevitable." Shen said, looking up, with just a hint of a smile on his face.
This prompted silence from the rest of the table.  Ayeka and Ryoko looked at 
each other, with looks of caring on their faces.  Tenchi laid each of his hands 
on one of theirs, and they all looked longingly at each other.  Washu broke the 
silence. 
	"To old friendships, and old rivalries.  They both shape our lives.  
Kempai!" she shouted, as she stood and raised a glass of Juraian Wine.
	"Kempai!" the rest of the group shouted in unison as they all raised their 
glasses and drank.
	"And another toast!  Here's to stayin' single, drinkin' double, and 
sleepin' triple!  Kempai!" Washu shouted as she took another drink before the 
rest could respond.
	"Well, the last two I'll drink to, but I kinda like this married thing.  
Kempai!" Ryoko answered with a drink of her own.  The rest sighed and drank out 
of politeness, although Tenchi secretly enjoyed drinking to the last part of 
Washu's toast.
	**"Your worse than me sometimes."** Ryoko thought to her mother.
	**"Hey, just 'cause I'm old, don't mean I'm dead!"** Washu sent back.
	"I hope you have some toasts left for us to drink to." A gentle voice from 
behind them said.  They all turned and saw a welcome sight.  Kirei was the first 
to voice it.  "Aunt Funaho!  Auntie Misaki!" she said as she leapt to her feet 
and ran to embrace them.  The rest of the group stood up as well.  Ayeka walked 
up to her mom and hugged her.  A day of separation didn't constitute a teary- 
eyed "mommy" ordeal...that took a whole THREE days now.  Besides, Kirei 
thankfully gave her a share of kawaii over-affection.  The group exchanged 
greetings and Tenchi pulled out a chair for Funaho while Shen pulled out one for 
Misaki.  Soon the table was alive again with conversation.
	"It's good to be back, God I hate those ceremonies...so boring!" Misaki 
said as she began to fill her plate.  Funaho and Misaki both still wore the 
green dots on their foreheads as a symbol of being the former Queens of Jurai, 
even though Ayeka and Ryoko now held that position.  The two former queens still 
lived at the palace, however, and performed all matter of official business, 
such as the aforementioned ceremony.  They were also as young looking and full 
of life as ever.  "I'm starving!" Misaki said eying her now full plate.  Tenchi 
poured his great-grand mother a cup of Green Tea, a brownie-move taught to him 
by his grandfather.  He had told him Funaho was NOT to be left sitting at table 
without a full cup of tea in front of her.
	"Thank you, Tenchi.", she said in her soothing yet firm voice.  "It is so 
good to see the family coming back together after so long.  I swear Shen gets 
bigger every time I see him.  And Little Washu, you look as cute as ever."
	"Why thank you, kind Lady, you are quite stunning yourself.  By the way, 
did you get that "package" I sent you a few months back?" Washu asked.  Funaho 
placed a knowing smile across her face.
	"Yes, I did.  The contents have been VERY useful, thank you." she answered 
conspiratorially.  This left everyone at the table looking at them. 
	"What package?" asked Ryoko.  Washu quickly changed the subject.
	"So, looking forward to seeing your son tomorrow?" she asked Funaho.
	"Yes, very much so.  It's been nearly 15 years, but after not seeing him 
for 700 years before, it hasn't seemed like all that long.  Nonetheless, his 
presence always delights me."
	"And I can't wait to see cute little Mayuka!  It's been ages!  I'm gonna 
give her the biggest hug ever!" Misaki interrupted.
	"Mother, that may kill her!  I remember a few of your hugs that nearly 
made me pass out from lack of air!" Ayeka teased.  Everyone chuckled.
	"Yeah, it's been so long since I saw dad and grandpa and Mayuka.  She must 
be as big as you now, Kirei." Tenchi said to his daughter.
	"I can't wait to see her.  How 'bout you, bro?  Ready to see your other 
sis again?" Kirei asked Shen.  In his entire life, Shen had met Mayuka only 
twice, once when he was five, and once at his parents fifteenth anniversary.  
She was a year older than himself and Kirei, and had struck him as a little 
na‹ve.  He hardly knew her, since his parents had decided that living on Earth 
with his grandfather and great-grandfather would be best for her because of 
her...background.  It would be hard on the girl to live on a world that despised 
and killed her mother, even though she was a demon.  In fact, he always thought, 
some people considered HIS mother to be a demon.  It never came up in open 
conversation, but he could sense it, the way some of the servants and guards and 
especially other members of the royal families who had lived through her attack 
on the planet looked at her with a mixture of fear and disdain, and him as well 
for being her child.  He handled the looks and whispers throughout the years 
just fine, he thought, and woe be to anyone who would dare speak of mother in 
any way other than respect.
	"Yes." he answered simply.
	
The meal/conversation went on for another three hours, at which time the 
servants had finished clearing the table and set up dessert, which consisted of 
simple crumb cakes and tea.  About ten minutes into dessert, the group heard a 
loud crash as pans and dishes landed on the floor.  They all looked up, but they 
knew what they would see before they even got there.
	"Oh my, I'm so sorry!  Here let me help you clean it up!" said the 
familiar perky voice.
	"Mihoshi, I swear!  You never watch where you're going!" said the familiar 
irritated voice.
	"No, it was totally my fault, Captain.  Please, I'll clean it myself." 
said the servant as he began to wipe up the spilled tea.  The two related and 
walked to the table.  The same scene repeated itself again as the entire party 
exchanged hugs and greetings.  The two Galaxy Police Officers had changed over 
the years, but not very much.  Kiyone now had even longer teal hair, and wore 
the dress uniform of a GP Fleet Captain.  Her face showed the hard life of 
patrolling and battles she had gone through, and exuded her confidence and 
authority, but she was still very young looking and attractive for being nearly 
40 years old.  Mihoshi had also shown the signs of aging, but only ten years to 
the twenty-plus the group had been together, as the average lifespan of her race 
was around 200.  She was, well, Mihoshi.  Blonde hair tied up in her purple bow, 
dark bronze skin, innocent smile and sparkling eyes.  She too wore the Captain's 
uniform, different from Kiyone's only in the fact that her top button was undone 
to allow for her...ample bust, and the little rabbit-tail on her rear that was 
her control cube.  Both had their own ships now, and both (even Mihoshi) had 
proven to be good captains.  They were the best of friends now more than ever, 
and still saw much of each other as their ships were both part of the same 
patrol fleet.
	Mihoshi dominated most of the talking for the next hour with stories of 
her adventures with Kiyone both on and off duty, and with the fact that Kiyone 
hadn't had any luck with men for almost a year.  Kiyone tried her best to 
explain the gaps in Mihoshi's train of thought, while also giving Kirei advice 
on how to be a good GP Officer.  Many funny anecdotes came up as well, mostly 
from Washu and Ryoko, who remembered surviving the early "Mihoshi Years".  
Tenchi just sat and enjoyed being with so many friends, as well as Ayeka.  Shen 
on the other hand tried his best to keep from staring at Kiyone, who, though she 
was twenty years his senior, he had developed a crush on since the last few 
times meeting her.  He even kept a picture of her in his dorm room at the 
Academy.
	More hours passed, and everyone began to feel the time in their bones.
	"It's past 1 in the morning, I think it's time we hit the sack, and it's 
been a long day." Tenchi finally said.  Washu let out a big, arm-stretching yawn 
to confirm she was as well.  Mihoshi was sitting up in her chair...out cold.
	"Then we shall all see each other again in the morning.  I want you all to 
see the preparations for the anniversary ceremony." Funaho said, standing up.  A 
half-asleep Misaki followed.
	"Yes, see you all tomorrow." She said sleepily.
	The group then said goodnight to each other and exchanged more hugs before 
departing.  Kiyone woke Mihoshi up and took her to their room, but not before a 
blushing Shen gave her a special goodnight by kissing the back of her hand.  
Kiyone smiled uncomfortably at this, and looked at Tecnhi and Ryoko, who just 
shrugged and smiled.  Soon, the party had gone their separate ways and the room 
was quiet and empty for the first time in many hours.

	The royal trio's bedroom was immense, with three separate washrooms, a 
large Jacuzzi, walk in closets, and surrounded by a garden on both sides, 
complete with several trees.  The center of the room was filled with a giant 
four-post bed of ornate design, covered in gorgeous Juraian silk sheets.  The 
entrance was a pair of twenty-foot tall double-doors decorated with a Jurain 
Royal Crest in the middle that split as the doors opened.  Ryoko stood in the 
doorway, talking with Mayan, the second-in-command of the Royal Palace Guard 
under herself.  "I want security doubled on everyone's rooms tonight, as well as 
at the arrival of my family from Earth.  This is a prime opportunity for an 
enemy to strike, having us all in one place like this." she said to the large 
man that stood nearly a foot taller than her.
	"Yes, Your Highness.  I've already put the Elite Guard on standby.  No one 
will harm anyone you care for, I personally guarantee it." he said, chest out.  
He was flanked on either side by two other guards.
	"Good.  I trust you, Mayan.  Good night." she said.
	"Good night, Your Highness." he answered, more relaxed now.  He turned to 
leave.
	"Mayan, we've known each other for a long time now, and I consider you my 
friend. It's okay to call me Ryoko, I've told you that." she said.
	"Of course, Your Highness." he answered with a smile.  Ryoko sighed and 
smiled back.  He then left down the great hallway.  Ryoko entered the bedroom as 
the massive doors closed behind her.  Tenchi was standing in front of a full-
length mirror, in a pair of sleep bottoms, looking at the scar that ran 
diagonally across his chest.  Ryoko walked up behind him and wrapped her arms 
around him.  He closed his eyes and felt the warmth of her breasts against his 
back, her breath on his neck.  She ran a finger across his chest, tracing the 
scar.  He opened his eyes and took her hand in his own.
	"Ryoko." He said quietly.
	"I know.  We're never completely safe.  Ever since that attempt on you, 
I've had security on this place tighter than the GP's armory.  But that was 
seven years ago, Tenchi, and there hasn't been a threat or attempt since."
	"That's exactly what I'm worried about Ryoko.  It's been too quiet for far 
too long.  And now with our anniversary, and the entire family being here 
together, it's just asking for trouble."  The two stared into mirror at their 
reflections.  Ayeka exited the shower just then, and saw Tenchi and Ryoko 
embraced in front of the mirror.  She walked over to them in her towel, noticing 
their worried expressions.  She wrapped her arms around him as well, and laid 
her head against his chest.  "What's wrong, my love?" she asked tenderly.
	"He's worried about an attack on us during the next few days." Ryoko 
answered for him.
	"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Tenchi." she assured him.
	"I can't not worry, Ayeka, if anything should happen to any of you..." he 
said, cutting himself off, not wanting to think of something like that.  Ayeka 
began to kiss his chest lightly.  
	"I know something that will take your mind off that, my dear." she said 
seductively between kisses.
	"So do I." Ryoko added, kissing his neck tenderly.  Tenchi quickly began 
to forget his worries, and by the time they moved over to the bed, security was 
the furthest thing from his mind.

	Half a mile away, in a secret chamber under the palace, a meeting was 
taking place.  Two men were sitting across from each other in a dark room at an 
old wooden table.
	"The preparations are complete.  Her Majesty's envoy will have no trouble 
landing on planet or entering the palace.  This anniversary will be their last." 
said the raspy voice.
	"The last for a great many things.  I shudder with anticipation, Tarkin." 
the second older, but clearer voice replied.  Both men were silhouetted, but the 
man with the raspy voice leaned forward, revealing his old, tattered features,

cosmos.  Inside the small, dark, oddly shaped craft sat a lone occupant.  His 
eyes were closed and his arms crossed, as if meditating.  He eventually opened 
his eyes to glance at the small screen in front of him.  On the screen was a 
picture of Ryoko and Ayeka, then, a picture of Tenchi.  A sinister grin curved 
up one side of the dark figures mouth.  The ship continued on its 
course...Planet Jurai.
