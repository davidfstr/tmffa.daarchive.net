Part 22

Akina slowly opened her eyes, her arms were stretched outwards and her legs 
dangled, she couldn't move, and she couldn't speak.  All she could really do was 
think about  her love, her daughter, her sister, her brother, and her family at 
the Masaki house.  Those thoughts were the only thing that brought her comfort 
as she stared off into the cold stillness.   
 
Kohana glared at her nemesis with hatred.
"It's been a long time Kohana, so very long........" Tanaka said.
"I've been waiting for this day Tanaka, for today will be your last!"  Kohana 
said.
"Oh?  It is, is it?"  He grinned.  "You took away my powers and sent them to 
this planet in the form of a gem, over those years my gem has collected 
plentiful amounts of precious energy."  He stretched his arms out and laughed 
slightly.
"Too bad it didn't gather enough."  Kohana said.
"Hmm?"  Tanaka glared at her.
"You think you're the only one that gained power?"  She grinned.
"Well, let's just see who is more powerful."  He got in a fighting position.
"Let's."  Kohana got in a fighting position as well.

Araumi floated above the Earth and couldn't believe her eyes, the whole planet 
was covered with a dark mysterious cloud.  "I knew it!  Something terrible has 
happened!"  She clenched her fist.  "Everyone, please be okay!"  Araumi said as 
she darted through the clouds.

Meanwhile Yukio and the others were heading towards Japan's coastline.
"It's freezing!"  Mihoshi sneezed and whined.
"Please try to endure it Mihoshi, Mom is depending on us!"  Kioko looked back at 
her.
"I'll try, but I don't know what good I can do!  ACHOOO!"  Mihoshi sneezed 
again.
"We need all the help we can get, Tanaka is almost invincible from what I've 
experienced."  Yukio kept his eyes focused and his fists clenched tightly.
Ryoko flew close to Tenchi and grabbed his hand.  "You know Tenchi, maybe you 
should fight close to me."  she grinned. 
"What!?  How dare you!  Lord Tenchi, you'll fight side by side with me right?"  
Ayeka grabbed his other hand.
"NOW ISN'T THE TIME!  WE HAVE TO SAVE AKINA AND DEFEAT TANAKA!"  Tenchi shouted.
"Hmph, you're just saying that because you used to have a crush on her."  Washu 
grinned.
"WHAT!?"  Kioko stared back at him.
"Uh!  No Kioko that's not true!"  Tenchi shook his hands and laughed.
"Kioko, don't be mad at him."  Juro smiled.
"You're right."  Kioko sighed and smiled at him.
Raikon laughed slightly at the small fight, He looked over at Kiyone and saw the 
worry in her eyes.
"Kiyone, Aki..........."  The white of his eyes glowed and he stopped.
"Are you okay?" Kiyone stopped.
"I.......yeah, I'm fine."  He looked slightly confused for a second then smiled.
"Are you guys okay?"  Tenchi and the others had stopped as well.
"Yeah."  Raikon took Kiyone's hand and they continued their way.

Kohana was slightly battle worn as she continued her battle against Tanaka.
"Not too bad Kohana!  You are strong!"  He laughed as he punched her fifty feet 
back.  "Too bad you're not strong enough!"  He prepared a beam in his hands
"GRAVITY SHIELD>>>>>>>"  Kohana held both her fists back. 
"KERAAAAA!"  Tanaka unleashed a crimson beam.
">>>>>>>X 1000!"  A large shield shot from her fists and bounced the attack back 
at Tanaka but with 1000 times it's force.
"DAMNIT!  You're still using that same technique!"  Tanaka growled as he shook 
it off.
"What am I going to do, he's more powerful than me."  Kohana thought.
"AKINA!"  Araumi shot from the sky.
"Huh?"  Tanaka glared at her and prepared an attack.
"YOU FOOL!  LOOK OUT!"  Kohana shouted at her.
"Huh?"  Araumi saw an energy ball flying at her.  "HOLY!"  She quickly dodged it 
and glared around.  "WHO THREW THAT!?  I'LL KILL HIM!"  She shouted.
"GET OUT OF HERE NOW!"  Kohana shouted.
"Wait a minute, you're not Akina.........."  Araumi stared then sensed something 
behind her.
"Fresh Meat!"  Tanaka grinned and grabbed her.
"GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME DAMMIT!"  Araumi shouted and elbowed him forcefully.
"Argh!"  Tanaka released his grip.
"Let's see how you like this!"  Araumi held her hand up and formed a purple 
energy disk.
"GET OUT OF HERE NOW!"  Kohana got in the way.
"Who the hell are you!?"   Araumi shouted.
"DIE!"  Tanaka lunged at them.
"YAAA!"  Araumi quickly tossed the disk through Tanaka's waist.  "Alright!  
Direct hit!"  She grinned.
"Fool."  Tanaka laughed.
"Huh!?"  Araumi realized she made no damage.
"ARAUMI!  GET OUT OF HERE NOW!"  Kohana shouted again.
"No!" Araumi got in a battle position.
"I'm sorry for this, but if you stay.........you will die!"  Kohana prepared to 
shoot Araumi out of the area.
"STOP!"  a weak voice called.
"What?"  Kohana seemed slightly shocked.

Tenchi and the gang were close.
"I can see them!"  Ryoko shouted.
"Right, everyone spread out!"   Washu called and the others circled the area.
"Eh?  Everyone!"  Araumi smiled when she saw her friends.
"Ratixian energy............"  Tanaka growled and glared over at Yukio, Kioko, 
Juro and Kiyone.  "I will destroy all of you!"  He shouted.
"He's ugly!"  Ayeka looked away from him.
"KIYONE I'M SCARED!"  Mihoshi whined.
"Be quiet!  If he doesn't know you're here then you'll be safe!"  Kiyone 
whispered and shoved Mihoshi behind a boulder.
"Leave them out of this Tanaka, your battle is with me!"  Kohana shouted.
"Silence, you're energy is weak!  You're not even a match for me!"  He prepared 
a crimson light in his hand.  "None of these light dwellers are a match for me, 
that's why I shall destroy them all!"  He prepared to fire the orb down at the 
planet.
"TANAKA STOP!!!!!"  Kohana shouted.
