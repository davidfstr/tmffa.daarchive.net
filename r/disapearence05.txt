               I do not own these characters, they are based on the Tv
shows,
  Tenchi Muyo, Tenchi Universe, and Tenchi in Tokyo.  I, however, do own
this
plot, it was my personal idea from my imagination, so don't copy without
permission, ok?  Thanks.  AGain, I DO NOT OWN THESE CHARACTERS!!!!!!  Thank
you!

WARNING!:  This will be very confusing if you have not read the first few
chapters, you have been warned!

              Tenchi stood in the kitchen, gasping.  He was tired, whatever
had just taken Ayeka was strong.  Very strong.
    He looked up when he heard a crash, Ryoko was on the floor, as if she
had
been leaning against something and had fell.  Grandfather stood behind her,
calm but distressed looking.
    He heard Ryoko moan.  " Oh, Tenchi!"  She quickly got up and flung her
arms around him.
    He was about to pull her off him when he noticed her sobbing.  So he
gingerly patted her back.
    " I'm here Ryoko"
    " Oh Tenchi!  I thought you  were going to Disappear as well!"  She
cried.
    " Why didn't you look at me?  I tried so hard to help you, but the
kitchen wouldn't let me in!"  She saw his confused face and said, " I know
it
sounds crazy, but it's true!  The kitchen wouldn't let me in!"  Tenchi
smiled.
    "  Just how hard did you hit your head when you fell?"  He asked.  She
was about to answer, but was interuppeted by a , " Tenchi!  What's going on?
Where's Mihoshi and Ayeka?  And why is Ryoko hugging you?"
    Tenchi blushed and answered, " Um...er, GET OFF Ryoko!"    As Ryoko
inhanced the look of hugging by squeezing him closer to her.  But, for once,
she stopped when Tenchi yelled at her, it just wasn't right without Ayeka
getting all angry.
" Come with me Sasami, I'll explain."  Yosho led the tired Sasami into the
living room.
    " Poor Sasami,"  murmured Ryoko.
    " Yeah,  I wonder what we do next."  Tenchi said.
" Should we try looking for them?"  he asked as he heard Sasami's muffled
tears and Grandfather's soothing voice.
    " I---I guess I  don't really know what to do," Ryoko answered at last.


***********************************************************

     About half an hour later,  Sasami was getting dinner while Grandfather,
Ryoko, and Tenchi talked.
    " It appears that if this hidden enemy wanted to kill us, they could
simply kill us all at once,"  Grandfather said.
    " Yes, they do seem to have that kind of power"  Ryoko agreed.
    " But what do they want?" wondered Tenchi.
    " They could be after the sword Tenchi, I suggest you keep it somewhere
safe" Yosho replied.
Tenchi shook his head, " If they wanted the sword, why didn't they just take
me in the first place?  Or take the sword while we weren't here?  it doesn't
make sense." They all sighed.
    " Yes it does, it makes sense,"  They all jumped, and looked at Sasami
who was standing in the doorway.
" Whoever is doing this would have to take all of Tenchi's protection away
form him.  They would have to know that as long as one of us was still here,
we'd rescue Tenchi anyway we can,"   Sasami said.
    " Are you saying Tenchi can't take care of himself?" Ryoko said angerly.
    " I think Sasami may be right," Yosho said slowly.  " That does make
sense"
Unfortunetly, this didn't cheer anyone up.
    " Well, dinners ready" Sasami stroked Ryo-Oki's back, even she seemed
sullen.




******************************************************************************

        " So, are we all agreed that going on with our lives is the best
solution?"  asked Tenchi over dinner.  " I mean, I can't think of any other
idea, we'll just have to fight once we go to wherever Washuu, Ayeka, Kiyone,
Mihoshi, and Dad are."
    Everyone nodded.  So for the rest of the day everyone tried to act as
normal as possible, yet everyone was trying to think of  what they could do
ti speed up time.


 The  next afternoon, Grandfather Disappeared quietly, it was strange, and
though Tenchi stayed in his room for the rest of the day, they were sad to
think, " Oh well, will I be next?"
                 ****************************************************

    Ryoko thought she was brave, she thought she would conserve her energy
so
she could fight the enemy when she got taken, she had thought Ayeka a coward
for screaming so.  But it was like being driven into ice. She felt an
overwhleming sense of fear and screamed, " Tenchi!!"
    She tried desperately to hold on, mentallly as well as phiscally, but
she
could feel herself slipping into......into what?  Where was she going?  She
screamed again, as another wash of coldness swept over her.

NO!  Tenchi thought as he raced up the stairs.  I won't let it happen again!
All the comprimises, all the plans for what to do when someone Disapeared,
all the agreement s that they would fight when they got there, vanished form
Tenchi's mind as soon as he heard Ryoko's scream.  Is it painful?  Is that
why they scream?  He wondered.  What if they are killing them, and we have
no
hope of fighting?  He did his best to rid the thoughts from his mind as he
reached Ryoko's room.

He burst in, and saw Ryoko, seeming to sink into her bed.  But there was no
hole.  it looked like she was shrinking.
  He grabbed her around the waist and pulled as hard as he could, but it was
no use, Ryoko kept sinking.
     Ryoko realized this half a second after tenchi did, but he held on
tight, and no matter how hard he pulled, he would only be sucked in with
her.
" Tenchi, go!  Let go! You'll be taken too!"  She cried as she pushed him
away form her.
" NO!  I'm not gonna let you go!" He cried.
" Tenchi!"  Ryoko used all her might to push him away.  This made her sink
further and she just managed to say, " I love you"  before she was taken.

******************************************************************************

********************

Tenchi  felt tears well up into his eyes as Sasami clung to him, crying
softly.
" Oh Tenchi, I don't want to be alone!"  She said.  " I'd rather be taken
first, because I don't want to be alone!"
    " I know Sasami."  He said simply.
Time passed, he didn't know how long before Sasami fell asleep.  He just sat
there, one arm around her, waiting.
    Some hours later, he looked down and almost screamed, Ssami's feet were
gone! And her legs were slowly disapearing too!
    Sasami woke when she heard him gasp.
    " What's wrong Tench-  AHHH!" she screamed and clung to him.
Tenchi hugged her tight, prepared to hear her scream, for it to happen, all
over again.
    But she didn't scream, all Sasami said was, " Ooh! Tenchi! It feels like
ice! I'm scared!  Please, don't let go till it's over" Then she was silent.
 " Don't worry Sasami, I won't let go"  He knew what he had to do, he
couldn't keep waiting, as  Sasami disapeared into the nothingness, he let
himself be taken too.


****************************************************************************

Falling, that was the sensation. Only never landing.
    Tenchi opened his eyes, he appeared to be in some sort of solid bubble,
he could see perfectly though.  And what he saw made him shiver.  Sasami was
across form him, but she looked like she was in pain, and didn't seem to see
him.
    He strained his neck.  Yes, beside him was Grandfather, across from him
was Ryoko, then Ayekay and Mihoshi, and Washuu and Kiyone,  and from what he
could see, they all looked fine, asleep, but alive.
              **************************************************************

" Hello Tenchi" said a voice.
Could he talk?  Tenchi tried, " Who are you?" he asked.  A man with short,
dark blue hair stood in fornt of him, beside him was two other men, one with
long black hair, and the other with short green hair.  They all wore red
uniforms and had brown eyes.
" You'd think he'd be asking where he was" whispered the Black haired man.
" No, his question is a good one, after all, the human mind cannot release
all it's anxiety at once, that would kill it."
" I suppose you're right.  Should we answer him?"  Black said.
" Should I answer him, he was asking  me, and yes, I shall."
He turned to tenchi again.  " My name is  Cuifero ( Quefeero) Jamaneeka.
Perhaps you would understand who I am better," He said as he looked at
Tenchi's baffled face, " If I said I was Kiyone's brother."
