Chapter #2 Secrets Revealed  
  
Author's Note: It has been several months since the scene occurred in 
chapter one. Lets see how things pan out as secrets are revealed! 
Writing format is changed, make note of this! 
It is mid-morning in the valley that is occupied by the various members 
of the Masaki Clan.  
Ayeka, Sasami, and Mihoshi were doing household chores, Ryoko was 
sleeping Lazily on a tree near the shrine, while Tenchi and His 
grandfather Katsuhito were sparring with their bokkens. Throughout all 
the activities, a single person was monitoring them all. Little Washu 
was hold up in her lab observing the various members of her family, and 
making notation all the while keeping tabs on several dozen experiments 
happening in various parts of her vast laboratory. 
Well it seems that Tenchi is improving, while my wayward daughter is 
sleeping again. She keeps this up she'll never get his attention. Washu 
had finished her mental comments when her Crab doorbell rang. 
It was Sasami requesting her presence at lunch. "Well gotta put in an 
appearance at least once today." she said to herself as she made her 
way to the lab entrance. 
As all the house hold gathered for lunch (Except Nobuyuki, who was at 
work) Washu was now thinking of something very important when a mental 
call came out to her.  
("Hey Mom, What's up you seem way out there?") Asked Ryoko 
telepathically.  
Both had grown closer through the intervening months and were on more 
friendly terms with each other. 
("No, My little Ryoko, I was just remembering something important I had 
to do in my lab.") . Answered a nervous Washu 
("Now, You really think that was all, I can sense it wasn't. Now 
remember we had a deal, no secrets or lies! Now tell me Mom!") Asked an 
now upset Ryoko. 
"All right what is wrong with you two", asked a concerned Tenchi. Over 
the time the women had stayed in his home, Tenchi had been able to pick 
up certain things that the girls exhibited. One was when Ryoko and 
Washu were having a conversation telepathically. This was more than a 
discussion, and He knew it. 
"Well?" Now looking a both of them, "What's wrong?" 
"Nothing to concern you Tenchi. Ryoko dear, lets discuss this after 
breakfast in the lab all right?" asked a calm Washu. 
After looking at her them Tenchi, Ryoko answered; "Ok Mom, but this 
better be good!" 
"Trust me it is!" Said Washu (Though not for me or Yousho I'm afraid.) 
***********************************************************************
*********** 
After breakfast was over, and everyone dispersed to their daily 
routines, Ryoko and Washu headed to her lab. 
Once inside, Washu materialized two floating cushions and her and her 
daughter sat down. 
"Ok, What's so troublesome, that you let it touch my mind?" Asked Ryoko 
Washu then grew into her adult form and Ryoko gasped. 
In front of her was her mother with a protruding belly. 
"Mom, What... who.... why....?" Washu then grabbed both her daughter's 
hands and slowly started to tell her stories with tears running down 
her eyes. 
"It started several months ago. We started seeing each other and it 
became more serious and obviously more intimate......." 
"Who Mom?" Ryoko was worried it might me who she hoped wasn't. 
"No, Dear it isn't Tenchi, now please let me finish." She was still 
weeping and clutched her daughters hands more firmly. Now Ryoko was 
worried for her mother, she squeezed back to show she cared. 
"Well, we have been seeing each other when this occurred or more 
precisely developed about 2 months ago." Ryoko was sensing fear in her 
mother, so as she is blunt by nature, she asked; 
"Why haven't you told him Mom?" Washu looked her daughter in the eye, 
and said; 
"I don't want another of my children to be forced away from me! I'm 
afraid he and the baby would leave me, and I can't take another loss 
like that. I lost my first child, then Kagato stole you from me, I 
can't go through that again!" She then collapsed in her daughter's arms 
and wept uncontrollably. Ryoko did her best to comfort her mother. 
After a few minutes, she calmed down enough for Ryoko to ask; 
Who is it Mom, if it isn't Tenchi, then who? As Ryoko quickly ran 
through all the men that had visited their home these last 3 months, 
she knew it was only two who could have been able to be the one. 
As, Washu was about to speak, Ryoko put her finger up, and said: "Look, 
Mom, I don't say anything to you about your personal life, but if it 
could be who I think it is, neither of them would desert you, they're 
too good hearted for that." 
Washu slowly nodded, "I agree now, I just was so scared to be abandoned 
again." 
"Then, go to him and tell him, because even in your child form, you 
can't hide it for long!" 
She nodded then she hugged her daughter. To think that you could give 
me such good advise, oh I'm so proud to be your Mom. Thank you my 
little Ryoko". They hugged again then Washu made a portal, and stepped 
through it to a certain shrine keepers office.  
  
***********************************************************************
*********** 
Hello, Dear, how are you doing?" asked Washu (Who stayed in her adult 
form this time) 
Katsuhito was sitting at his desk writing up prayer verses for visitors 
to the shrine to hang on the sacred tree. He had his back to Washu. 
Well, what do I owe the pleasure of your visit for 
Wasssss......................?!?!? 
He stared at the building abdomen of Washu. He couldn't talk nor could 
he think as he continued to stare which of course made Washu nervous 
again. Tears started to well up in her eyes "Oh, Gods say something you 
idiot," which she said as much to herself as to the stunned man she 
loved. 
"Wh.. wh... when?" 
"It was conceived 2 months ago, Yousho, ... by us!" She then knelt down 
and placed her hands in his. "I wanted to tell you earlier, but I was 
afraid you'd reject me." (She was shaking like a leaf now) Katsuhito 
suddenly changed to The younger Yousho, and gathered his love into his 
arms and hugged her tightly. "I Love you Washu Habuki, I am..... happy 
to see that another life will be born out of our love for one another."  
Washu was crying now, but these were tears of joy and happiness. (Yes, 
he wasn't going to leave her alone, and they were going to have a baby, 
their baby together.) 
Then he let go of her and slowly walked to the far closet. he opened it 
and then came out with a ornate case. He knelt down, opened the case 
and there was a ring of wood. Washu was trying to keep from fainting as 
she surmised that the wood came from Funaho, Yousho's tree, and they 
this was in Jurian traditions a wedding band. 
If you will submit to being my wife, I will set up the bonding ceremony 
witnessed by our family so we will be connected mind body, and soul, 
together for as long as we both shall live. 
Washu grabbed the ring and set it on her finger, then she reached out 
and kissed and hugged the now young Priest as the afternoon rolled into 
night. 
Chapter #3: Union of Love 
Next, telling the family their secret and the wedding of two old souls, 
with a new one on the way. Hope this will make those that have e-mailed 
me about this story happy, it will not go past chapter #3!
