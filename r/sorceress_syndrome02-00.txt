I hope everyone liked The Sorceress of Jurai!  Well, even if no one 
did, I wrote a sequel! So, if you didn't read The Sorceress of Jurai, 
you haven't the slightest idea of who Keimosari is, you poor thing.  
Once again, I do not own Tenchi Muyo!  Nobody sue me.  And, for 
everyone who knows my true identity, you can tell I'm in this one.  See 
ya!

	"Let her go!" Tenchi yelled.  The insane scientist Dr. Hadenka 
was holding him and his friends captive.  At the moment, he was trying 
to force Tenchi's sister, Keimosari, into a strange machine that looked 
oddly like a phone booth.
	"My dear boy.  She does no good to me like this.  This machine 
will harness her power, and make it useful," Dr. Hadenka replied 
calmly.
	"And what'll happen to her when the power is harnessed?" asked 
Tenchi bitterly.  Hadenka didn't answer because Ryoko had been freed 
from the bonds that had tied her to a statue.  She attacked Hadenka 
with ferocity, but for some reason, he didn't defend himself.  Half 
dead, he shoved Keimosari into the machine, pressed a button, then 
stumbled over to a lever on the wall.  Even from so far away, Tenchi 
could see it said SELF-DESTRUCT.  Afterwards, Hadenka collapsed on the 
floor.  
	After quickly freeing the other girls, Tenchi said, "Get out of 
here!  I'll help Kei!"  He ran to the machine and used his sword to 
break down the door.  Keimosari was laying on the floor unconscious.  
Tenchi grabbed her by the waist but then something happened.
	There was a huge flash of light, and Tenchi felt as if his sister 
was being pulled apart in his arms.  He tightened his grip on her, and 
then a girl of about twelve or thirteen appeared in front of him.  She 
had short blond pigtails that curled around her ears, and aqua-gray 
eyes that peered out from behind gold-rimmed glasses.  
	"Who are you?" Tenchi asked.  The girl just smiled and pulled out 
a gun.  With one quick movement, she shot Tenchi in the heart.  He fell 
to the ground.

	"Are you okay Tenchi?" asked Washu.  Tenchi was on a bed in her 
lab, and Keimosari was no where in sight.  This worried Tenchi, because 
his sister was the most important thing in the world to him.  She was 
the Sorceress of Jurai, the guardian that was sworn to protect the 
Jurai Royal Family using the Star of Jurai, from which the Ultimate 
Power stemmed.
	"Where's Kei?" Tenchi asked.
	"I'm sorry Tenchi, but she was gone when we found you," said 
Washu.  All of a sudden, as if on a cue, Keimosari burst through the 
door of the lab.
	"Kei!  Where were you?" Tenchi cried.  But before she could 
answer, Washu looked at her computer screen.
	"Tenchi be careful!  That's not Keimosari!" she yelled.  
Keimosari looked at her.
	"What are you talking about Washu?  Of course I'm Keimosari!" she 
cried.
	"That's impossible.  There's no power radiating from you," Washu 
explained.
	"Kei, where's the Star?" Tenchi asked quickly.
	"You guys are so weird.  It's right here," she said, then put her 
hand to her neck.  The chain on which the Star of Jurai hung was gone.  
Kei screamed.
	"Oh no!  What happened to it?  And how come I'm not dead?" cried 
Keimosari.
	"Hold on.  I still don't know if you're Keimosari.  If you are, 
you'll be able to answer this question correctly-" Keimosari cut Washu 
off.
	"E=mc squared," she said quickly.
	"Absolutely correct.  You are Keimosari.  Only she could read my 
mind and learn the question I was about to ask," Washu replied.  "Now, 
let's see."  Washu began scanning.  About twenty minutes later, she 
looked up from her computer.
	"I don't get it Keimosari.  According to this, you never were the 
Sorceress of Jurai.  There's no trace of your power, not even signs 
that you were from another galaxy.  Something's definitely wrong," said 
Washu.  Tenchi thought back to what he'd seen.  Had the girl that had 
appeared in front of him done something to Keimosari?  He tried to 
picture the girl, but his mind drew a blank, and he felt a terrible 
pain in his chest, as if he had been injured there.  He cried out in 
pain.
	"Tenchi!" the girls cried in unison.  Tenchi looked over at 
Keimosari.  She was holding his hand, and something was on her wrist.  
He slowly pulled up the sleeve of her shirt and looked at it.
	It was a bracelet.  It had a silver chain, and ten little stones 
were attached.  They were gray and cloudy, and looked nothing like 
Tenchi had ever seen.
	"Kei?  Where did you get that bracelet?" he asked.
	"What bracelet?  Oh, that one.  I don't know," she said.
	"Maybe it has something to do with your power, like your 
necklace," suggested Washu.
	"Maybe.  But I don't think we should be worrying about fashion 
accessories now.  I don't know what happened to my power and I have to 
find out!" Keimosari cried. 
	"I know!  I'll do a scan on it and see if I can find anything," 
said Washu.  "Tenchi, you can stay here for the night, if you want."
	"That's okay Washu.  I'll get up now, I guess," Tenchi said.

	After dinner, Washu still hadn't found anything.  They were all 
watching TV when it was time for the news.
	"Our top story tonight is the earthquakes they've been getting in 
Sapporo," the announcer said.  For some reason, everyone leaned closer.
	"For some reason, there have been unusually strong quakes, many 
going off of the Richter Scale.  The city has been evacuated, and the 
damage is rising.  Luckily, very few have been injured and no one has 
died due to the quakes."
	"Tenchi, I am really starting to doubt this is a coincidence.  I 
mean, first I lose the Star and my power, then we find that weird 
bracelet, and now there are awful earthquakes in Sapporo?  No 
accident," Keimosari said.
	"I think we had better check this out," said Washu.  "Get ready 
for a trip!"
