TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. Dining room - DAY (Wednesday, 21 August 1996)

Tenchi, Father, and Sasami sit at the table enjoying tea and donuts.

One chocolate donut and one powder donut are left in the bowl.

FATHER
Thank you for another wonderful breakfast, Sasami.

SASAMI
You are welcome Father.

FATHER
At least I get to come home early today.

TENCHI
Why is that dad?

FATHER
All I have to do today is finalize some specifications with a client.  
It's not a day off, but it is close.

SASAMI
I will make you some prawns for lunch then.

FATHER
My favorite.  You always spoil me Sasami.

Sasami giggles.

Father leaves the room and Ryoko and Ayeka walk in.

Ayeka still looks sleepy while Ryoko does a big stretch.

Ryoko jumps on Tenchi.

RYOKO
Are you going to play with me today?

Ayeka sniffs loudly and sits down next to Tenchi.

She reaches for the chocolate donut only to have Ryoko snatch it up.

AYEKA
That was mine you troll!

RYOKO
Take the powdered one.

AYEKA
I wanted the chocolate.

Ryoko stuffs it in her mouth.

RYOKO
Still want it?

Tenchi closes his eyes and shakes his head.

AYEKA
You barbarian!

Ryoko gives Ayeka the raspberry spraying donut all over her and 
Tenchi.

Tenchi is growing hot.

AYEKA
How dare you!

Ryoko swallows.

RYOKO
If you don't want the powdered one I will take it.

Ryoko reaches for the donut only to have Ayeka snatch it up.

RYOKO
Now who's the donut hog.

Ayeka stuffs the donut in her mouth.

Tenchi clenches his fists.

Ayeka gives Ryoko the raspberry spraying donut over her and Tenchi.

RYOKO
Damn you Ayeka!

Tenchi leaps to his feet.

TENCHI
Why don't you just kill each other and get it over with!

Tenchi storms out of the room.

RYOKO
What's the matter with him?

Ayeka shrugs her shoulders and swallows the donut.

Sasami shakes her head.

SASAMI
There are more donuts in the kitchen.

Ryoko and Ayeka look at Sasami.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

EXT. Temple yard with temple in the background - DAY

Tenchi, dressed in work clothes, angrily sweeps the walk.

His broom strokes emphases his words.

TENCHI
Why... Can't...  They...  Get... Along...

Grandfather, dressed in his everyday wear, exits the temple and stands 
on the top step.

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi, come here!

Tenchi runs to stand in front of his Grandfather.

TENCHI
Yes grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi you are about to begin your last year of High School, right?

TENCHI
Yeah, I will finally be finished.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi and Grandfather on temple porch. - DAY

Grandfather sits down on the top step.

GRANDFATHER
So what will you do next?

Tenchi sits down one step below and to Grandfathers right.

TENCHI
Go to college I guess.  I like working here at the temple, but I 
don't know if a life of a priest is for me.  So much has happened 
around here that I have not given my future much thought.

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm, I see.

TENCHI
Maybe you could advise me Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Advise for your life is seldom wanted or well received.

TENCHI
I don't know what would be the right thing to do.

GRANDFATHER
Could the problem be closer to home?

TENCHI
I don't want to hurt any of them Grandfather.  But I need to live 
my life and not their fantasy!

GRANDFATHER
So which one will you choose?

TENCHI
What!  What are you saying?

GRANDFATHER
If you do not like things the way they are then change them.  
If you choose one the others would then leave you alone.

TENCHI
If I choose one then I lose the rest, right?  Somehow I think they 
all are important to my future.

GRANDFATHER
Let's talk about each one, Tenchi.

TENCHI
Mihoshi is the only one near my age.  Even Sasami is 700 years older 
than me!

GRANDFATHER
All right.  What about Mihoshi?

TENCHI
Well, she is cute.  I just don't think any man could live with her 
all the time.  If ever I were in a fight I would definitely want 
Mihoshi at my side.  I don't know what will happen but I do know we 
would win.  And I am not sure that Mihoshi would give up her career 
as a Galaxy Police Detective to marry me.

GRANDFATHER
You are a Prince of Jurai.  How about the Princesses.

TENCHI
Hmmm.  Well there's Sasami.  She is going to grow up to be quite 
beautiful.  I remember meeting Tsunami before we knew Sasami's secret.  
She may be old in wisdom but right now she is to young for marriage.  
I think of Sasami as my little sister.

GRANDFATHER
And Ayeka?

Tenchi laughs at the thought.

TENCHI
If I marry my grandfather's sister does that make him my 
grand-brother-in-law?

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi!

TENCHI
It's hard to say what I feel about Ayeka.  She's my great aunt, she's 
my friend, and she does want me if only to stop Ryoko from having me.  
She is Jurai.  The blood flows strong in her.  She is duty and justice.  
I think she also keeps many secrets.  And...

GRANDFATHER
And what?

TENCHI
If I marry her I may have to go back to Jurai!

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm.  Well what about the other two?

TENCHI
Little Washu.  The story of her life makes me want to cry.  How can 
people be so hateful Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
You will find hateful people in all societies and in all places.  Even 
we can become hateful people Tenchi.

Tenchi frowns at that thought.

He then smiles.

TENCHI
When auntie brought Taro over for those few days I got to see the 
girls in action.  We were all in the same boat, and it was sinking.  
Then Little Washu stepped in and she went at it like a pro.  I don't 
think she wanted anyone to know, but she was really enjoying herself.  
Later I found out she had a baby son!  But her husband left with the 
child because he was noble and Little Washu was not.  Little Washu 
may want my baby as part of her research but I don't think she will 
ever marry again.  I hope Little Washu can find love again.

GRANDFATHER
If you truly believe Tenchi, then all things are possible.  You have 
saved Ryoko for last it seems.

TENCHI
Grandfather, why didn't you kill Ryoko when you had the chance.  She 
did so much damage on Jurai, and she nearly killed your sister Sasami.

GRANDFATHER
It was an evil I chased Tenchi.  An evil I vowed to destroy!  I 
followed Ryoko across the galaxy to here.  When the opportunity came 
to destroy her, I couldn't.  I was unable to harden my heart because 
Ryoko was innocent.  She had done her share of bad things but there 
was no evil in her.  It was Kagato that needed to be destroyed.  I 
imprisoned her and remained on Earth.

TENCHI
You could have imprisoned her and still returned to Jurai, and to 
Ayeka.

GRANDFATHER
It's those hateful people Tenchi.  There was too much prejudice on 
Jurai.  If I went back to Ayeka and married...  Who would get the 
throne?  And who would find out I did not keep my vow to destroy 
Ryoko?

TENCHI
Why did you let me have the keys Grandfather?  By giving me the keys 
it freed Ryoko.  Which brought Ayeka and Sasami.  Which brought 
Mihoshi.  Which brought Kagato.  Which freed Washu.  Which put me 
here today.

GRANDFATHER
If I remember right you took the keys from me.

TENCHI
Yeah, right!

GRANDFATHER
I can not see into the future Tenchi.  I only knew that Kagato was 
coming for Ryoko.  It was time for you to know your heritage Tenchi.  
By freeing Ryoko you could fight Kagato.  It would also allow Ryoko 
a chance at redemption.  I believed that your heart would be greater 
than Kagato's evil.

TENCHI
When one of Washu's experiments went wrong Ryoko had a chance to 
keep me forever.  I believe that Ryoko truly loves me more than 
life itself.  She loved me so much that she let me go.  But I 
worry about Little Washu.

GRANDFATHER
What?

TENCHI
I am a Crown Prince of Jurai.  By those judges, Ryoko is the creation 
of someone already rejected by the noble houses.  She is less than 
nothing.  What would happen to Ryoko if I returned to Jurai 
grandfather?  Could it be a repeat of Little Washu's life?

GRANDFATHER
Washu's husband was weak Tenchi.  He wanted status more than he wanted 
his wife.  Are you weak Tenchi?

TENCHI
I don't think so Grandfather.  But how will I truly know until I am 
tested?

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm.  So you have paid attention to your lessons.

		TENCHI
What was the purpose of this talk Grandfather?  Why do you want me to 
choose now?  Is something going to happen if I don't?

GRANDFATHER
You are about to become a man Tenchi.  Men must make decisions.  You 
can not let the situation continue like this forever even if you 
wanted it to.  And yes, I feel that the Masaki clan is again 
threatened by future events.  We must be strong and united to face 
them.

TENCHI
Hmmm.  Why must we be the focus of attack!

Tenchi stands and clenches his fists.

TENCHI
Never mind, I know my duty Grandfather.  We will be ready.  Thank you 
Grandfather.

back to Ayeka.

kneel behind me and look over Little Washu at the camera.

TENCHI
Sasami, can Ryo-Ohki take her usual spot on top of your head?

SASAMI
Oh yes Tenchi!  She was afraid you were going to leave her out of the 
picture!

Ryo-Ohki runs to the front jumps onto Sasami's lap, shoulder, then to 
the top of her head.

RYO-OHKI
Meow, Meow, Meow.

TENCHI
No Ryo-Ohki, I would not forget you.  You are important to me also.

All the girls give Tenchi a thoughtful look.

TENCHI
I will only say this once.  This is our official group photo.  If 
anyone does something to spoil this photo I will take it again without 
you.

AYEKA
When you tried to get your sword back.  In my bedroom.  In my bed.

Ryoko lets out a wail off camera.

Ryoko is racked with tears.

TENCHI
Do you remember when we first met Ryoko?

RYOKO
You mean at your school where you called me a monster.

TENCHI
No, before that.

RYOKO
Oh, you mean in that damn cave where you called me a freeze-dried 
mummy.

TENCHI
No, before that.

Ryoko looks over shoulder at Tenchi for the first time.

She is still crying but she has stopped sobbing.

TENCHI
When I was little my Mother died.  At the time I thought I had done 
something bad so she left me.  I did not understand how life worked 
then.  I thought the whole world revolved around me.  Now I know 
that it wasn't because I did something wrong that she died, but 
because I did something right.

EXT. Close up of Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Washu, Mihoshi, and Ayeka - DAY

Washu's back is to the camera hugging Ayeka.

The other three have tears in their eyes.

TENCHI (O. C.)
When I went back to save her, she had to save me.  She gave up her 
life's energy so that I might have a future.  Yet if I hadn't gone 
back none of us would be here.  So there I am without a mother and 
blaming myself.  

EXT. Close up of Tenchi and Ryoko - DAY

Tenchi is still kneeling beside Ryoko holding her shoulder.

Ryoko is still crying, looking over her shoulder at Tenchi.

TENCHI
I ran to the shrine to cry out my misery.  While I was there a 
spirit touched me.  She said it wasn't my fault and that my mother 
still loved me even though she had to go away. That as long as I 
loved her she would always be with me.

Ryoko stops crying.

She takes a hold of Tenchi's hand on her shoulder.

TENCHI
I took great comfort in that.  I thought it was the spirit that 
guarded the shrine and kept us safe from the demon locked inside.  
I didn't know very much about spirits then either.  But now I know 
there was no spirit guarding the demon.  It was the demon who came 
out to comfort a little boy.  It wasn't a demon of evil but a demon 
of love.

RYOKO
I love you Tenchi; I love you so much it hurts.

Tenchi pulls out another handkerchief and gathers Ryoko up to her 
feet in his arms.  

He dabs at her face.

TENCHI
Are you ready for your photograph now?

Ryoko looks lost and puts her hands to her face.

Ayeka moves into the scene with a shy look on her face, and hands 
Ryoko her compact. 

Ryoko does a quick touch up and smiles handing the compact back to 
Ayeka.

Ayeka moves off camera while Tenchi and Ryoko move to stand in front 
of the digital camera.

TENCHI
Okay Father.

FATHER (O. C.)
Done, Son.

Tenchi and Ryoko look at each other and say nothing.

They kiss like lovers lost who found each other again.

Tenchi and Ryoko separate.  Ryoko has eyes only for Tenchi.

TENCHI
Father, can you have those pictures printed out in time for supper?

EXT. Close up of Father - DAY

Father taking down the camera.  His eyes are filled with tears.

FATHER
Sure Tenchi, no problem.

EXT. Front of house - DAY

After gathering his gear Father goes into the house.  The other 
girls gather around Tenchi.  Everyone is quiet.

TENCHI
I am going to go to the hot spring now.  I need to relax.  If you 
wish, I am inviting all of you to join me.

Tenchi moves down the steps and off camera.

All the girls look at each other and move into the house.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Nobody is in the pool.

Tenchi moves into the scene with a towel around his waist.  We 
view him from behind.

TENCHI (Expressed as a thought)
Well here it goes.  The final part of the plan.

Tenchi claps twice and holds his hands together in a silent prayer.

Tenchi drops his towel to the ground and moves into the pool.

He sits down, facing to the right of the scene, looking straight 
ahead, and awaits the others.

Ryoko moves into the scene, wearing her robe, with her back to the 
camera.

She looks down and sees Tenchi's towel.

She looks at Tenchi who is looking straight ahead.

RYOKO
Hmmm.

Ryoko discards her robe partially covering Tenchi's towel.

She flies out over the pool and settles down on Tenchi's right side.

TENCHI
Hello Ryoko.

Ryoko says nothing but lays her head on Tenchi's chest with the top 
of her head touching Tenchi's cheek, and wraps her arms around 
Tenchi's waist.

Tenchi places his arm around Ryoko.

Ayeka moves into the scene, wearing a towel, with her back to the 
camera.

She looks at Ryoko and Tenchi and then looks down at the robe and 
towel.

Ayeka turns red and drops her towel on the pile.

She dives into the pool and stays low swimming over to Tenchi.  She 
moves to Tenchi's left.

TENCHI
Hello Ayeka.

Ayeka says nothing but lays her head on Tenchi's chest with the top 
of her head touching Tenchi's cheek.  There is a small separation 
between her and Ryoko.  She wraps her arms around Tenchi's waist 
just above Ryoko's arms.

Tenchi places his arm around Ayeka.

Washu moves into the scene, wearing her towel, with her back to the 
camera.

She looks out over the pool and down at the pile.

WASHU
Well, when in Rome...

Washu drops her towel and moves out into the pool to stand in front 
of Tenchi.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko - DAY

WASHU (O. C.)
Hello Tenchi.

Tenchi looks at Ryoko and Ayeka then moves his head to look up at 
Washu.

TENCHI
Hello Lit...

Tenchi silently stares at Washu.

Ryoko and Ayeka look up at Washu and their eyes go wide.

EXT. Close up of Washu - DAY

Little Washu is not so little.  She is again in her adult form and 
looks every inch the goddess that she is.

Washu smiles at Tenchi.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka - DAY

All three with eyes wide.

Tenchi swallows.

TENCHI
Hello, Little Washu.

Washu laughs off camera.

EXT. Close up of Washu - DAY

Washu is again in her young form.

WASHU
I still want your baby Tenchi.

Washu points down at Tenchi and laughs.

WASHU
But I don't think I'm going to sit in your lap this time!

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko - DAY

All three look down.

Tenchi turns bright red, and Ryoko and Ayeka's mouth fall open.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Washu moves over and sits next to Ayeka.

She leans against her, laughing.

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka are all red faced now.

Sasami moves into the scene, wearing her towel, with her back to 
the camera.

She has Ryo-Ohki on her head.

She looks over at the pool and sees Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka all 
red faced looking down in the water.

Washu is laughing at some private joke.

She looks down at the pile of towels.

Ryo-Ohki jumps off onto the pile of towels and flips onto her back 
to sun herself.

SASAMI
Hello Tenchi!

Everyone suddenly looks at Sasami and Washu joins the red-faced 
group now.

TENCHI
Hello Sasami.

Sasami giggles.

She drops her towel on Ryo-Ohki.

EXT. Close up of Ryo-Ohki - DAY

Ryo-Ohki moves under the towel.

RYO-OHKI
Meooow!

Ryo-Ohki moves out from under the towel and gives Sasami a dirty look.

She gets back on top and resumes sunning herself.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Sasami moves out and sits down next to Ryoko.

SASAMI
What's so funny?

ALL FOUR
Nothing Sasami!

Tenchi reaches with his hands to touch Sasami and Washu.

TENCHI
Where's Mihoshi?

EXT. Close up of Sasami - DAY

Sasami appears very concerned.

SASAMI
She is still inside the changing room.  I think she is afraid to 
come out.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko - DAY

Ryoko and Ayeka with eyes close snuggle against Tenchi's chest.  
Their heads are touching now.

TENCHI
Mihoshi afraid?  I don't think Mihoshi is afraid of anything.

EXT. Close up of Washu - DAY

Washu looks lost in thought.

WASHU
Emotions can be very freighting, Tenchi.  Paralyzing.  After all 
I should know.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko - DAY

Ryoko and Ayeka are looking at each other.

TENCHI
Ryo-Ohki!

EXT. Close up of Ryo-Ohki - DAY

Ryo-Ohki flips over on her feet at the sound of her name.

RYO-OHKI
Meow?

TENCHI (O. C.)
Please bring Mihoshi out here Ryo-Ohki.

RYO-OHKI
Meow, Meow, Meow.

Ryo-Ohki dashes off camera.

EXT. Changing room door - DAY

Ryo-Ohki in her girl form is dragging Mihoshi out by her towel.

Mihoshi is mumbling protests.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Looking at Mihoshi from behind.

Ryo-Ohki rips the towel from her and changes to her cabit form as 
the towel falls on the pile.  

Mihoshi quickly covers herself.

Ryo-Ohki settles on the towels and begins sunning herself.

Mihoshi covers herself and turns bright red

She is hopping from foot to foot.

TENCHI
Hello Mihoshi.  Please join us, we are all family here.

SASAMI
Yes Mihoshi, please come into the pool.

MIHOSHI
You...You...You want me to join you?

TENCHI
Yes Mihoshi.  You can lean against my back.

Still covering herself Mihoshi moves out into the pool behind Tenchi.

She sits down back to back with him.  

Mihoshi visibly relaxes and turns her head to the left, eyes closed.

TENCHI
This is how it should be.  One big happy family.  I believe my soul 
has found peace at last.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi - DAY

Ryoko and Ayeka are still looking at each other.

Ryoko begins to cry.

TENCHI
Why the tears Ryoko?

RYOKO
Tenchi...  Tenchi... Who... What...

TENCHI
What is it you want to ask Ryoko?

Ryoko relaxes and stops crying.  She closes her eyes.

RYOKO
It...  It doesn't really matter anymore Tenchi.  I love you Tenchi, 
and that is enough.

Ayeka begins to cry.

TENCHI
And now tears from you Ayeka.  Why?

AYEKA
Tenchi...  Tenchi...  I am sorry, Lord Tenchi, but...

TENCHI
Yes, Princess Ayeka?

AYEKA
Tenchi, you will always be Lord to me, but Tenchi... Who holds your 
heart?

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
Who holds my heart, Ayeka?  Is that your question?

Ayeka nods her head, eyes closed.

TENCHI
Is that what you were trying to ask Ryoko?

Ryoko nods her head.

TENCHI
Sasami, would you like me to answer that question?

EXT. Close up of Sasami - DAY

SASAMI
I think I know the answer Tenchi.  But yes, would you please 
answer my sister's question.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi - DAY

Ayeka has stopped crying and has a smile on her face.

TENCHI
Little Washu, would you like me to answer that question?

EXT. Close up of Washu - DAY

WASHU
Please Tenchi, would you answer my daughter's question.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi - DAY

Ryoko now has a smile on her face.

TENCHI
Mihoshi, would you like me to answer the question?

Mihoshi yawns.

MIHOSHI
What Tenchi?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, Tenchi, please answer.  I know 
it will be the right answer, Tenchi.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

TENCHI
I hope it is the right answer Mihoshi.  Such an easy question, 
but I am afraid it is not an easy answer.  Who holds my heart?

Sasami and Washu both look at Tenchi.

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Mihoshi snuggle in with eyes closed.

TENCHI
Well nine names come immediately to mind.  First would be 
Grandfather, Yoshou.  His actions have brought us all together.  
He has taught me better than I knew.  He will always hold a part 
of my heart.

Everyone looks very relaxed as they enjoy the warm water.

TENCHI
Second would be Mother, Achika.  She lived life to the fullest.  
She brought me into the world.  I am so happy I was able to meet 
her when she was young.  I love her and miss her very much.  She 
will always hold a part of my heart.

Sadness crosses the faces of Sasami and Washu.

Ryoko and Ayeka hold tightly to Tenchi.  Mihoshi appears to be asleep.

TENCHI
Third would be Father, Nobuyuki.  When you look at him today you 
may wonder what my Mother saw in him.  I asked Grandfather if he 
approved of Mother's choice.  He told me that Achika was a very 
wise woman.  I looked at my Father again and saw past the false 
front.  I thought I missed Mother, but he misses his wife every 
day.  He always talks to her.  He doesn't expect an answer, but 
he knows she is listening.

Tenchi looks directly at Washu.
					
TENCHI
He lost his wife when she was young.  There is no one who could 
replace her.  At least he still had me.  I hope to never experience 
his loss.  He will always hold a part of my heart.

Sasami looks down into the water stirring it with her hand.

Washu clasps her hands to her face and bows her head.  Tears leak 
out between the fingers.

Tenchi turns his head and looks over at Ryo-Ohki.

TENCHI
Next will be Ryo-Ohki.

EXT. Close up of Ryo-Ohki - DAY

Ryo-Ohki is lying on her back.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Ryo-Ohki is truly unique.  A creation of Little Washu, but with a 
mind of her own.  Even if that mind is on carrots 99 percent of 
the time.

Ryo-Ohki rolls over at the mention of carrots.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Take a look under that basket Ryo-Ohki!

Ryo-Ohki moves to the basket and looks inside.

The basket is empty.

Ryo-Ohki sniffs the air.

RYO-OHKI
Meooww!

Ryo-Ohki dives through the basket to the hollow underneath.  

She pops back out with two large carrots in her mouth.  

She moves back over to the towels and begins to eat.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Sasami, Ryoko, Ayeka, and Tenchi are looking at Ryo-Ohki.

Mihoshi still looks asleep.

Washu is still covering her face with her head bowed but she has 
stopped crying.

TENCHI
Ryo-Ohki is a true friend.  She demands nothing for her 
friendship.  She loves everyone equally and unconditionally.  
She is fearless as a starship.  She is pretty and talented as 
a little girl.  And as a cabit she has made the carrot our cash 
crop.

RYO-OHKI (O. C.)
Meow, Meow.

TENCHI
Ryo-Ohki holds a part of my heart.  I hope I hold a part of hers.

Washu's lifts her head and drops her hands.  She stares at the sky 
lost in thought.  

Ryoko and Ayeka close their eyes and snuggle deeper into Tenchi.

Sasami looks at Tenchi with hope in her eye.

TENCHI
Hmmm.  I think next will be Princess Sasami.

Tenchi turns to look at Sasami and smiles.

Sasami blushes.

TENCHI
Sasami, your story has not been an easy one.  To have brushed 
against death at such a young age.  To have been saved by the 
Power of Jurai.  I hope you can forgive Ryoko for what she did.

Ryoko shudders at the memory.

Sasami hugs Ryoko.

SASAMI
My brother Yoshou forgave you long ago Ryoko.  Though you did 
no evil in my eyes, I also forgive you Ryoko for whatever guilt 
you still hold.

Ryoko removes her right arm from Tenchi and wraps it around Sasami 
pulling her close.

She kisses the top of her head.

Ryoko returns to holding Tenchi tightly and closes her eyes.  

Ayeka raises her left hand to Ryoko's face.

AYEKA
I too forgive you Ryoko.  Jurai holds no debt against you.

Ryoko nods her head and smiles.

Ayeka returns to her hold on Tenchi.

TENCHI
Sasami, experience has made you wise before your time.  You are 
in the flower of your youth and these should be happy times.  
You cook, you clean, and you try to brighten our day.  All of this 
with out expecting reward or thanks.

Sasami waves her hand and looks embarrassed.

TENCHI
I apologize for all the times I didn't say "Thank you, Sasami."  
Whenever I see you, no matter what you are doing, I think "Thank 
you, Sasami."  Because I am thankful that you are here.  You are 
the face of unconditional love.  You, Sasami, will always hold a 
part of my heart.

Sasami smiles and plays in the water.

Tenchi looks over at Washu.

Washu looking at the sky feels Tenchi's eyes and turns to look at 
him.  Washu looks like she is alone in the world.  

Sasami also looks at Washu.

TENCHI
Little Washu.  Somewhere a son and how many generations have sprung 
from him?  How many walk the universe with your very noble blood in 
them?

Washu begins crying again.

TENCHI
Little Washu, the greatest scientific genius in the known or unknown 
universe.  But more than that.  Two daughters in Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki.  
Fine daughters that bring credit to her name.

Washu stops crying and has a beaming smile.

TENCHI
Your heart bursts with love, Little Washu.  I saw it when Taro came 
to visit.  I see it when you look at Ryoko.

Ryoko lifts her head to look at Washu.  

Washu raises her left hand to touch Ryoko's face.  

Ryoko lowers her head and closes her eyes.

Washu lowers her hand.

TENCHI
Little Washu is always ready with a solution to any problem.  There 
is no difficulty she can't overcome.  You helped me save my Mother 
and my future.  You helped your daughter, Ryoko, find the meaning 
of love.  You experiment on us.  You maneuver us.  You don't do any 
of this with malice, but because you want what is best for us.  To 
have lived so long and still feel there is something out there for 
you to continue on.

Washu's face takes on a sly smile while Tenchi's face grows serious.

TENCHI
When you truly feel the time is right Little Washu.  I will do what 
I must for you to have that baby.

Ryoko and Ayeka suddenly look up at Tenchi.

TENCHI
You know I don't give my promise lightly, and I know you will not 
abuse my trust.  That is why you hold a part of my heart Little 
Washu, and you always will.

Ryoko and Ayeka look at each other and close their eyes snuggling 
into Tenchi.

Washu looks stunned at Tenchi's announcement.  

She smiles and returns to looking up in the sky with a thoughtful 
look on her face.

Sasami giggles and starts playing in the water.

TENCHI
Mihoshi.  Are you awake Mihoshi, or are you flying through slumber 
land.  Ah, Mihoshi you are pure chaos.  You affect everything you 
touch.  Including me.  I think the Gods, Mihoshi, have touched you.  
Your luck can not be explained away.  I don't think you would claim 
to be a genius, yet you can manipulate the most complicated systems.

Washu gives Mihoshi a calculating look.

TENCHI
When you put your hand to it things seem to fall apart.  When we 
look back we see that it was the only way to achieve success.  
I trust you with my life Mihoshi.  As long as you are by my side 
I can never be defeated.

Sasami is giggling in her hands.

TENCHI
My gain is the Galaxy Police's loss.  Thank you Mihoshi for being 
true to yourself.  You will always hold a part of my heart Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
I'm so embarrassed Tenchi.  You say such nice things.

Mihoshi yawns and lies still against Tenchi with a smile on her face.

Tenchi removes his hands from Washu and Sasami and hold Ryoko and 
Ayeka tightly.

They snuggle into him in response.

TENCHI
I said nine names and that is seven.  There're only two left.

Sasami and Washu look at Tenchi.  

Ryoko and Ayeka look up while Tenchi looks down at them.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi - DAY

TENCHI
I will start with Ayeka, Princess of Jurai.  Duty and justice 
flows strongly in your blood Ayeka.  You have taught me that there 
is more to the world than myself.  That a sacrifice made for the 
greater good is not a sacrifice, but a victory.  

Ayeka nods her head and smiles brightly.

TENCHI
Against impossible odds you stand defiant.  A great and powerful 
Princess, yet you humble yourself.  You do not shirk from doing 
the day to day dirty work.

Ayeka's face glows.  Ryoko flinches.

TENCHI
Your compassion for others in need touches me Ayeka.  Your love 
for your sister is genuine.  

Ayeka looks over in Sasami's direction.

TENCHI
I remember the anguish you suffered when you thought you lost 
Yoshou.  The realization he was my Grandfather was a shock to 
you.  I don't know if I can replace Yoshou, Ayeka.

Ayeka presses a finger against Tenchi's lips.

AYEKA
Nothing can replace Yoshou, Tenchi.  You have already surpassed him.

Ryoko opens her eyes and looks at the two of them and her eyes mist 
over.

She quickly ducks her head back down.  

Tenchi removes Ayeka's finger and kisses her.

TENCHI
I just want to make sure you know who I am, Ayeka.  I want you to 
know what you may have to give up for me.  I do not want you to 
enter any relationship blindly.

AYEKA
All that was mine is yours, Lord Tenchi.  There is nothing from 
my past that holds me back.

TENCHI
Nothing Ayeka, not even your father?

AYEKA
Not even him, Tenchi, not even him.

TENCHI
I do love you Ayeka.  You will always hold a part of my heart.

Ayeka settles in against Tenchi.

Ryoko quivers, tears run from her closed eyes.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

Sasami looks lost in a dream staring at her sister.

Washu stares at Ayeka with a calculating look.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Mihoshi - DAY

TENCHI
Ryoko, Ryoko, my sweet Ryoko.  Did you fear I would have forgotten 
you?

Ryoko looks up her eyes misty.  

Her mouth opens but she says nothing.

TENCHI
You at a loss for words?  Why do I tease you Ryoko?  Is it to hide 
my feelings?  You touched my heart so long ago.  You were the 
mother I longed for after mine was gone.  Why do you think I came 
to the shrine so regularly?  I longed to see you and touch you, Ryoko.

Ryoko's face brightens at Tenchi's words.

TENCHI
And now here I am holding you close to me.  You taught me that all 
work and no play makes for a dull life.  You are a free spirit Ryoko.  
Will you survive long tied down to me?  Can you give up the universe 
to stay beside me Ryoko?

RYOKO
You are my universe Tenchi.  In you Tenchi my spirit soars free.  
I won't say I'll never disappoint you.  I can't be your mother.  
Sometimes I do things long before I think of consequences.  I am 
sorry I hurt you...

Tenchi covers Ryoko's mouth with his hand.

TENCHI
I loved you from the moment I saw you in the schoolyard, Ryoko.  
You have always held a part of my heart.

Tenchi kisses Ryoko.

Ayeka stiffens slightly and relaxes; a smile spreads across her face.

TENCHI
Such an easy question, but a very difficult answer.  I guess I 
really didn't answer the question.

AYEKA
You answered the question just fine, Tenchi.  Like Mihoshi said, 
it would be the right answer.  Thank you Tenchi.

RYOKO
Yes Tenchi, thank you.

EXT. Pool as seen from the changing room - DAY

SASAMI
Oh my, it's getting late!  I need to get dinner ready.

WASHU
Yes, it is getting late and I have some work to do.  Let me take 
you home Sasami.

TENCHI
Sasami, Grandfather will be at dinner tonight.

SASAMI
Okay.  I will make something special for him.

Washu and Sasami reach the edge of the pool.  

Ryo-Ohki moves long enough for them to gather their towels.  

They wrap themselves in their towels and head for the exit.  

Washu puts a hand on Sasami's shoulder to stop her.

Washu looks straight ahead at the changing room door.

WASHU
Tenchi, something has changed.  I don't like it when something 
I thought was a constant turns out to be a variable.  But even 
variables need an outside force to change them.

TENCHI
Maybe, Little Washu, I found out how to conquer my emotional fears.  
I just had to admit to myself what I was really afraid of.  Truth 
and love are very powerful cures Little Washu.

WASHU
Thank you, Tenchi.

TENCHI
You are welcome, Little Washu.

Washu and Sasami exit the pool area.

Ayeka puts a hand to Ryoko's face.  They meet eye to eye.

AYEKA
It is time for us to go.

RYOKO
What?

Ayeka's eyes glance at Tenchi and back to Ryoko.

RYOKO
Oh, yeah, right time to go.

Snoring can be heard from Mihoshi.

Ryoko and Ayeka both look over Tenchi's shoulders.

Ryoko and Ayeka stand up and take Mihoshi by the arms and move 
toward the towels.

AYEKA
Time to go Mihoshi.

RYOKO
Whew, I think she has put on some weight!

MIHOSHI
What's happening?  Is it time to go?  I was just starting to relax.

RYOKO
You are always beginning to relax.

AYEKA
Let's keep moving.  Don't want to be late for supper, Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Supper!  Oh goody what do you think it will be tonight...

Ryo-Ohki moves to let the girls get their towels and robe.

They move off to the changing room.

Tenchi, low in the water, moves over near Ryo-Ohki.

EXT. Close up of Tenchi and Ryo-Ohki - DAY

TENCHI
Well that went pretty well Ryo-Ohki.  At least they didn't kill me.

RYO-OHKI
Meooww?

TENCHI
They should be out of there by now.  Ryo-Ohki, will you check to 
see if the girls are gone?

Ryo-Ohki dashes off to the changing room.

She quickly returns.

TENCHI
All clear?

RYO-OHKI
Meow!

As Tenchi exits the pool Ryo-Ohki moves to stand on Tenchi's towel.

TENCHI
Ryo-Ohki, give me my towel!

As Tenchi bends over to pull out the towel Ryo-Ohki changes into 
her girl form and puts a tight hug around Tenchi's neck.

Tenchi picks up both Ryo-Ohki and the towel.

TENCHI
It's okay Ryo-Ohki.  You don't have to be afraid.  If it works out 
no one will have to leave.

Tenchi enters the changing room carrying Ryo-Ohki.

Grandfather!

Sasami exits for the kitchen.  Washu exits for her lab.

Door opens and Mihoshi leading Ryoko and Ayeka walk in.

Mihoshi is smiling and humming to herself.

Ayeka grabs Ryoko's sleeve while Mihoshi heads up the stairs.

AYEKA
We need to go to my room to talk Ryoko.

Stop it right there!  I've heard this argument before and I've 
told you I don't care about your royal blood!

AYEKA
No, No, No.  That is not what I meant.  Oh dear!  Please Ryoko 
let me start over.

RYOKO
Just say your piece Ayeka!

AYEKA
I want to talk to you about the laws and customs of Jurai.

RYOKO
Why should I care about that?

AYEKA
Because Tenchi is Jurai!

RYOKO
So.

Ayeka takes on a sweet and innocent expression.

Ah, Sasami.  Do you think you can teach me to cook?

SASAMI
Of course, Ryoko.  Would you like to start with breakfast?

I don't think I'm ready for breakfast.

Maybe something later in the day.  How about supper tomorrow?

That would be great Sasami.

I think I will join you tomorrow, Ryoko.

Oh, Sasami, they left you with the clean up again.  Let me help you.

No you stay there, Tenchi.  It will only take a moment.  Thank you 
for the photos Father.

Tonight calls for a drink! Nobuyuki will you do the honors.

Huh, oh yeah, right away dad.

GRANDFATHER
A very pleasant dinner Tenchi.

TENCHI
Oh, yeah.  Sasami always does a wonderful job.

GRANDFATHER
I meant that I did not hear a single argument during dinner.  
Most unusual.

Father returns with the sake.

He pours for each of them.

TENCHI
I don't know if I am ready for this.

Of course you are Tenchi.  You have come of age!

So did you reach a decision today?

Well I need you to explain something to me.

No!  Please be serious Grandfather!

GRANDFATHER
I am listening, Tenchi.

TENCHI
I need you to explain Jurai laws and customs to me.

INT. Kitchen - NIGHT

Sasami is quietly cleaning up.

GRANDFATHER (O. C.)
Why not ask Ayeka.  She is much more current on these things than me.

TENCHI (O. C.)
I don't think I can ask Ayeka and see the sunrise again.

Sasami stops what she is doing and cocks her head to listen looking 
through the slats.

INT. Dining room table looking toward kitchen - NIGHT

TENCHI
Your mother, Funaho, is the Empress of Jurai, correct.

GRANDFATHER
Yes.

And Ayeka and Sasami's mother, Misaki, is also an Empress of Jurai.

GRANDFATHER
Yes.

So is their mother a courtesan or a mistress?

Grandfather falls over laughing.

GRANDFATHER
I see why you did not want to ask Ayeka!

Grandfather sits back up.

GRANDFATHER
Neither Tenchi.  She is the Emperor's wife.  His second wife.

TENCHI
But...  But...  But your mother is still alive!

Grandfather falls over laughing again.

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi!  Jurai is not Earth!

Grandfather sits back up, and looks at the kitchen.

Tenchi, on Jurai a man can have three wives.  The law says he must 
treat each of them equally.

INT. Dining room table looking toward kitchen - NIGHT

Grandfather looks at Tenchi.  Tenchi looks very thoughtful at the 
revelation.

Did that help Tenchi?

TENCHI
What?  Oh, yes Grandfather.  That helped quite a bit.  Well it is 
getting late.  Good night Grandfather.

Tenchi stands up to leave.

GRANDFATHER
One moment Tenchi.

Grandfather reaches in his kimono and pulls something out.

GRANDFATHER
Here take this, you may need it later.

GRANDFATHER
Keep them Tenchi.  You never know when the enemy may strike, and 
you must be prepared for any eventuality.

Tenchi stuffs them in his pocket and shakes his head.

He exits the room.

Tenchi is in his room now.  I know what you are planning Ayeka.

SASAMI
I want to wish you luck Ayeka.  I love you too much to let Tenchi 
get between us.

AYEKA
Why, thank you Sasami.

Ryoko touches Sasami's shoulder.

AYEKA
Sister.

RYOKO
Sister.

They both stiffen.  Ayeka knocks loudly on Tenchi's door.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Who is it?

AYEKA
It is me, Ayeka.  I need to talk with you Lord Tenchi.

TENCHI (O. C.)
It is kind of late Ayeka.  Can't it wait until morning?

RYOKO
No it can't wait Tenchi.  This is important!

TENCHI (O. C.)
Ryoko...  Ayeka and Ryoko!

The door opens with Tenchi standing in front of the door.

TENCHI
What do you two want now.

Tenchi looks them both up and down.

TENCHI
Why are you dressed like that?

Ayeka and Ryoko both place a hand on Tenchi's chest and push him 
into the room.

AYEKA
It is time for us to have a serious talk Lord Tenchi.

RYOKO
Yeah.  About your duties and responsibilities Tenchi.

The door closes.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Hold on here.  Hey, what is that?  Stop!  What are you doing?  What 
is that for?  Ouch!  Hey, that is too tight.  No, don't do that.  
Oh no, help. 

Tenchi's protests are drowned out by Ayeka and Ryoko's laughter.

be there.  So here I am.
