(NOTE:This is my first fan-fiction.  If you continue to read, please bear with 
me.  Thank you, and enjoy) If you see some ***,  I am making a reference to an 
episode of the Telivision series.  If you see some dialogue wrpped in <>? Then 
the writer is entered into the scene.


                                 NO NEED FOR A PLOT!


	The sun is setting in the west, casting an array of colors across the sky.  
As the sun drops deeper beneath the horizon, shadows overcome the carrot garden 
where we find our hero, Tenchi, and of course, Ryo-ohki, finishing a hard day of 
work.
	"Let's go, Ryo-chan!" says Tenchi, just starting to pick up his basket of 
carrots.
	"MEOW!!!" says Ryo-ohki, "MEOW MEOW, MEOW!!!"  Ryo-ohki picks up her 
miniature basket of carrots, and begins to follow Tenchi.
	"Did you have fun today, Ryo-ohki?"
	"MEOW!!!"
	"That's good.  You worked really hard today.  You deserve a big bowl of 
carrot stew!"
	"MEOW, MEOW"
	Just then, a eerie light is shed upon the shadows.  Tenchi pivots and 
searches for the source of the light.  The light seems to come from all 
directions......then only one.
	"C'mon Ryo-chan!"  Tenchi says as he begins to run in the direction of the 
light.
	"MEOW!" Ryo-ohki says in a panicked voice.
	As they run, they dodge the bracnches and roots of the surrounding trees.  
As Tenchi emerges from the greenery, he is blinded by a strange light.  He 
squints, trying to see through the gleam, and sees.......a funny old man with a 
flashlight!
	"Oh-ho!" says the funny old man, peering through his coke bottle bifocals, 
"So you're the voices I heard!"
	"Who are you?" asks Tenchi.
	"I'm an old man, what do I look like, a rabbit?"
	"No, you look like an old man..."
	"That's because I am one!  You're it!!!"  He taps Tenchi on the shoulder 
and runs off at a an unusually fast pace.
	"How quickly he runs!"   ***AYEKA, EPISODE 2, OVA #1***
	"Did I hear Ayeka?" asks Tenchi.
	"MEOW, MEOW, MEOW???"
	"Nevermind, let's find the old man!
	The chase begins again.  Tenchi and Ryo-chan search frantically for the 
old man.  Tenchi, out of breath, sits down on the ground in a semi-clearing in 
the woods.
	"You'll never find me..." says the old man.  Tenchi jumps to his feet, and 
looks straight up, where the old man is hanging by his knees from a tree.
	"You gave yourself away old man!"
	"That's what you think..."  He swings off the tree, and disappears in to 
nowhere.
	"What the hell? That really sucks."
	"Yes...It does...."  The old man pops out of a bush.
	"That doesn't make any sense!"
	"Who says this Fan-Fic has to make any sense?" says the old man.
	"I do!" says the old man popping out of another bush, on the other side of 
the clearing.   (Yes, there's two now)
	"Me too!" says yet another old man.
	Tenchi looks on in bewilderment.  Ryo-chan is oblivious to everything as 
she happily munches on a carrot.
	<"How many of you are there?"> 
	"We don't know, it's your fan-fic..."
	<"Okay.......eight!">
	Five old men pop out one by one numbering themselves off, "4, 5, 6, 7, 8!"
	<"....How about nine?">
	Another old man pops out, "9!"
	<"Nevermind...that's too many.">
	"Wait a minute, I'm necessary to the plot!"  He is gone in a puff of 
smoke.
	<"That'll teach you to think you're impoertant to the plot....there is no 
plot!">
	"That was our line!"  said the 8 old men in unison.
	<"That's what you think... I'm the writer!">
	"Oh, manevolent writer!  Thank You for this wonderful Fan-fic of 
nosensical gibberish," says Tenchi, bowing down in awe.
	Sudennly the 8 old men begin chanting: "Brown nose, Brown nose"
	<"You don't have to suck up... you're the star!  And you old men....Shut 
UP!!!!!">
	A cricket chirps.
	<"That's too quiet!">
	Sound returns to normal.
	<"That's better.  Anywho....where were we?">
	One of the old me says, "We had just popped out of the bushes."
	Another old man, "Don't think you're important..."
	The "helpful" old man disappears in a puff of smoke.
	Tenchi asks, "Which one of you is real?"
	Each old man points to them self.  All but one..."I've always been a 
loner...."  He disappears in a puff of smoke.
	"Why are you all here?"
	"I was lonely..." He disappears in a puff of smoke.
	<"Now there's only 5?  You guys are dropping like flies!">
	The crowd of old men gives answers like: "He told me there was gonna be 
pie." or "I'm here caus he's here" or "I wanted to be important" or "I dunno, 
I'm not the writer.."
	<"Don't try pass this on as my fault, It was my strange friend'd idea!">
	<<writer's strange friend: "I delved into the pits of ultimate EVIL for 
these ideas">>
	<Don't talk to the characters... that's my job!>
	<<writer's strange friend: "sorry.. I'll go.....">>
	"Okay, I'll ask you one more time...or I'll kill all of you...Which one is 
the real one?" asks Tenchi.
	Four of the old men point towards the one remaining.  Then... they 
disappear in a puff of smoke.  The one remaining says, "We're all real!" then... 
he disappears in a puff of smoke.
	"This is too screwed up for mere mortals to understand...I'm going home." 
says tenchi as he finds his way back to the carrot garden.
	"MEOW" says Ryo-chan still completely oblivious while finishing off her 
carrot.
	"Let's go home Ryo-chan"
	"MEOW, MEOW"
	Tenchi stopped every few minutes, all the way home, looking at some figure 
that looked like the old man.  The whole time he was thinking: I never got him.  
I'm still it!
	At the gates to the house, Tenchi and Ryo-chan were met by Azaka, 
Kamidake, Ayeka, Ryoko, and....The old Man!!!
	<"Oh, wait...My bad... I was just imagining things.">
	Anywho...
	Ayeka gives a dainty bow to tenchi and kindly says, "Welcome home Tenchi, 
How was your day?"
	But, all this was drowned out by Ryoko appearing and screaming, "Hi 
TENCHI!" and Hugging around his neck almost choking him.
	Tenchi was hardly able to mumble, "LET GO RYOKO!!!"
	Ayeka runs over and grabs Tenchi away from Ryoko saying, "Leave Tenchi 
alone!"
	Ryoko grabs him back and exclaims, "He's Mine!"
	"MINE!"
	"MINE!"
	"MINE!" said a mysterious voice from behind a tree.  Ayeka an Tenchi look 
to see an old man waving at them, and disappearing in a puff of smoke just as 
Ryoko looks over.
	"Who said that?" asked Ryoko.
	"That old man who was just over there..."
	"What old man?  Oh, well..."

	<"what make you think that YOU a lowly... friend of the writer AND fan-fic 
stealer could ever stand up to me the orignal writer? the only reason you even 
were able to steal this fic was because of the fact that I went to the bathroom 
and to get a snack."> 
	<<with a confident look in his eyes "when I assumed the position of writer 
I assumed all the powers pertaining thereunto" he stated smugly "and besides I 
have made some changes while you were gone" he said even more smugly than his 
last statement >> 
	<"maby so but I can still stop you from writing anything"> 	<<"we'll see

up the old writer then left>>> <"uhg! you did make some changes but that woln't

	<"good god! is that EVA unit 1!?"> 
	<<you bet! hey shinji go ahead and take a 5 minute break!" shinji noded 
and headed off towards NERV>> 
	<"ok fine I CAN'T defeat you but why don't we co-write this story?"> 
	<<"co-write? hmmmmm... let me think about that for a sec..." as he sits 
there visions if dancing bannas and singing cats fills his head with the 
ocasinal shiny sphere that tells him to obeay his thitst by drinking a sprite in 
a gas staion bathroom in toronto>>
