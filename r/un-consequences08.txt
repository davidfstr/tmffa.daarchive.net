Chapter #8: Thank Goddess It's Friday! 
Washu's Lab, Early Friday Morning: 
Early morning at the Masaki residence.  
Though in Washu's now open lab three of the injured and traumatized 
residents lay or were held in an unconscious state.  
While Tenchi and Ryoko were suspended in regeneration tanks, their 
spouse to be Ayeka lay in a bed next to them.  
Washu came in from a night of fitful sleep in the arms of her love 
Yousho.  
After the previous nights happenings, her restful sleep was going to 
come in handy now.  
"Well, better get to work." said Washu as she started to examine First 
Ryoko, then Tenchi with her scanning devices.  
After a few minute she triggered the specific sensors to wake her 
daughter  
up first since she was the one with lesser injuries and Washu's mental 
link would  
make it easier to calm her down as she woke up. 
Ryoko slowly started to revive and the first sound he heard was her 
mothers' voice.  
("Wakey, wakey my Little Ryoko") said Washu mentally. 
"What ... how...?" Was all she could say as she realized first where 
she was, then why.  
"Is. is Ayeka all right?" asked a groggy Ryoko.  
Washu, proud of her daughter's concern for her old rival, now best 
friend.  
"She's sleeping on the bed next to you." Ryoko looked down with a small 
smile on her face.  
"She insisted that she sleep next to you to be able to apologize to you 
for ...what happened."  
Before Ryoko could say anything, Washu emptied the tank Ryoko was in 
and helped  
her out of it. After Washu helped Ryoko dry off she explained  
what happened since she and Tenchi were out of action. 
"You mean the Princess almost killed herself... because of the fight, 
and she worried about me and Tenchi."  
That was all Ryoko could say as she looked at her friend on the bed.  
Washu looked concerned due to her daughter's silence.  
Then Ryoko mentally asked Washu to get her some food, and she'll laid 
down on the bed  
to be there when Ayeka awakens. 
As her daughter gathered up the still sleeping Princess into her arms. 
Washu then said;  
"She really is your best friend, isn't she?" 
"Even though we can drive each other nuts, I don't trust anyone more 
than her, or Tenchi," she added. 
Washu was curious so she asked; "Even with what she did to you two?" 
Knowing how Ryoko would react. 
"Mom, you know better than anyone how it feels to have no control. 
Especially Under Kagato's influence" 
"Yes I know daughter, I ...and you know that too well. Isn't that the 
other reason you can be that close to her now?"  
Before Ryoko could answer "You sympathize with her, and I am proud of 
you My Little Ryoko,  
you make me proud to be your mom!"  
She then hugged her daughter who had a confused look, which suddenly 
changed with a realization. 
"Thanks Mom, I ...love you too." Washu pushed Ryoko in front of her, 
with a surprised look.  
Then both women started to cry.  
They hugged again and held each other for several minutes as both let 
out much of their pent-up emotions from  
all those millennia of Abuse, and terror, and of self-doubt. 
As both gained some composure a beep alerted Washu to Tenchi waking up.  
She with her robots help then took Tenchi from his regeneration tank.  
He looked first at Ryoko who carefully hugged him and she helped Washu 
clean of and dress him.  
With all that had happened this week he lost that part of his 
inhibitions as Washu and Ryoko filled him in with  
what had happened after Ayeka injured them.  
He then turned towards the sleeping Princess. Ryoko had assumed her 
previous position  
holding Ayeka's head on her right chest. He then asked Washu to help 
him stand up.  
Washu then explained that he would have to begin his physical therapy 
this coming week.  
But Tenchi cut her off and then told her to stand back. 
Washu then saw a quite an unexpected sight. A single light hawk wing 
appeared and slowly passed through Tenchi.  
It seemed to hesitate as it passed his spinal column, and thenslowly 
dispersed.  
Washu immediately brought her scanners online as a startled Ryoko 
watched the whole show from the bed where  
she had been holding the sleeping Princess. 
Tenchi then just looked at the Scientist and his future mother-in-law, 
and waited for her evaluation.  
"Tenchi, you ...just shaved off 6 weeks of Rehab to just one week. How 
did you do that?" 
"I don't know, Washu, I ... just ... knew it would work," said an 
equally Surprised Tenchi. 
"Well, at least you had the decency to do it where I can analyze it, 
Thanks Tenchi." 
"Not a problem Washu, Now can I join my fianc‚'s since I know Ayeka 
will need both of us when she wakes up."

The Princess awakens 
Ayeka was stirring. Mainly due to Washu giving her a wake up shot given 
using a hypo spray  
very much like one used in an on sci-fi series from the states.  
As the purple haired First Princess of Jurai opened her eyes she saw a 
fuzzy bunch of Cyan and flesh colored shapes.  
Her eyes finally focused and a smiling Ryoko was what she saw.  
She grabbed the ex-pirate and started to cry as she hugged her. For her 
part Ryoko patted her friend on the back  
and held her as she sobbed. 
Ayeka finally spoke after a few minutes. "Oh Ryoko, I am sssoo sorrry. 
So sorry  
(Sniff) can you forgive me for what I did?" 
"No!" answered a calm and collected Ryoko. 
Ayeka looked up in disbelief, but before she could say anything Ryoko 
continued.  
"You have done nothing to forgive My Prissy Princess.  
You ... had ... no ... control over what you did Ayeka.  
So I do not forgive Garyu for using you. I know too well what happened 
to you."  
She looked at her friend weeping in her arms with a knowing look.  
"I am you friend, and true friends forgive anything that friends do, 
especially if they had no control." 
Ayeka finally replied; "I am not worthy of your forgiveness, my 
friend." She looked down then. 
"Damn it Ayeka, don't you think I have had the same feelings as you 
now.  
Remember this was one night, I had 5000 years that Kagato had taken 
full control of my body  
with me not being able to do a thing." She then took a breath to calm 
down, then took her friend's hand in hers.  
"Ayeka, I know, OK. Washu told me about the Counselor who's coming here 
next week.  
We'll both face this together." 
"You would agree to take therapy sessions... with me?" said Ayeka. 
"It would help me too you know!"  
In her normal Exhuberant attitude. Ayeka knew what her friend really 
meant.  
She would need Ayeka, as much as She would need Ryoko.  
Both friends smiled as Ayeka stopped sobbing, and Ryoko wiped her tears 
away.  
After a foghorn of a nose being blown. Both girls then turned and saw 
Tenchi standing behind Ayeka next  
to the bed.  
Washu had by now disappeared into the house to get some breakfast.  
Ayeka then hesitantly lets go of Ryoko and stands in front of Tenchi.  
She looks down and prepares herself for a negative reaction.  
Instead Tenchi gathers her up on his arms and kisses her passionately. 
He then lays her down, in the middle of the bed next to  
Ryoko and gingerly settles in Ayeka's other side. As Ayeka tries to 
open her mouth,  
Tenchi places a finger on her mouth and nods no. Then he speaks;  
" You and the young lady [Ryoko] behind you are the most important 
people in my life. And as Ryoko said,  
You did nothing to be forgiven for since you weren't in control.  
So my feelings haven't changed. I love you Ayeka, as I love Ryoko. So 
is that clear, My Princess?" 
"Yes, My lord Tenchi ...It is!" said Ayeka happily. 
"Good, now will you inform you mother Ryoko that we will be late to 
breakfast,  
so have her tell Sasami to have some food for us later on in the 
morning, please?" 
"Ok Tenchi, but why are we going to be ... Oh! You little dickens you!" 
said Ryoko. 
"What do you mean Ryoko, I.... ohh my," said a surprised Ayeka. 
"Tenchi Can you handle us both, even with your inhibitions?" asked a 
cat eyed Ryoko. 
"Remember your mother said we can't do that. Buuutt that doesn't mean 
... we can't do ...other things,"  
said a now very red-faced Tenchi. 
"My word Lord Tenchi, are you ...well can you ... oh my I can't say 
it." a flustered Ayeka said. 
"Princess, you don't need to say anything, you just (Licking her lips) 
do what comes naturally, ... well except that." 
Both girls are now eyeing a nervous Tenchi. "I... see your point, Now 
where to start."  
As things start off in Washu's lab. Back at the Masaki Residence the 
family is having breakfast.

Friday Morning Breakfast: 
All the family members are there except the three recovering in Washu's 
lab.  
As Sasami serves the others with Mihoshi's help, she wonders of her 
sisters' health  
and of last nights battle. Washu then squeezes her hand to try to calm 
the young Princess.  
Sasami sits next to Mihoshi, who has a tired Nobuyuki next to her. He 
took a late night drive from his  
downtown apartment when Mihoshi used her control cube to have her 
shuttle transport her back home.  
Since then he stayed up while holding a crying Mihoshi after she had to 
drag Tenchi into Washu's lab.  
Yousho sat next to Washu who both also looked tired. Right as breakfast 
is finished  
Washu gets the message from Ryoko and informs Sasami of the further 
need for food in a few hours.  
She smirks at her daughter's thoughts as she cuts off her mental link 
for obvious reasons. 
"Washu, is something wrong?" Yousho asked as they make their way back 
up the shrine steps. 
"No, Yousho, it's just that the kids have discovered that sex ... isn't 
limited to the standard if you remember,  
Monday night?" The now young looking priest had a smirk on his face and 
nodded.  
He took her hand as they walked up the shrine steps to finally get to 
their bed to catch up on their sleep.  
By the time they had made it to the Shrine, Nobuyuki and Mihoshi were 
in their room snuggling  
and also catching up on their sleep. And for once the day in the Masaki 
house was quiet  
except for a giggling Jurai Princess, and a shape changing cabbit.  Who 
now in her little girl form were  
playing hide and seek on what would have normally been a busy and noisy 
day.

A "Late" Breakfast: 
As Friday afternoon came three individuals straggled into the house 
from Washu's lab. Ayeka,  
who held Tenchi on one side while Ryoko was on his other side, made 
their way to the kitchen.  
On the island at the kitchen's center were three ready-made instant 
microwaveable breakfasts.  
"Well, we deserve this," said a tired but smiling Ayeka. 
"Yeah, but I think one day missing Sasami's cooking was worth it, don't 
you agree my darling Tenchi?" asked Ryoko. 
"You two are going to need to take it easier on me, remember I still 
have a week's Rehab to go through,  
Ok girls?" Pleaded a tired and hurting Tenchi. 
"Ok, Tenchi dear." answered a smiling Ryoko. 
"That is fine with me, Lord Tenchi." Replied Ayeka. 
Then Ryoko whispered to Ayeka "You know Princess I can't wait till he's 
100% and allowed to do the deed." 
"The deed as you put it is something to anticipate, and yes I hope he 
heals up quickly." said a now smiling Ayeka.  
Tenchi, who could hear the girls' comments, could only groan at next 
week's possibilities,  
as their late breakfasts were finishing in the microwave.

Two New students: 
At about 2 PM Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko made their way to the shrine 
practice area,  
where Yousho and Washu were waiting for the trio. "Washu Why are you 
here?"  
asked a curious Tenchi. 
"Why, I am here to help Lord Yousho train you three." replied the red-
headed scientist. 
"But, Why would my brother need help in training us in hand to hand and 
Bokken combat?" asked Ayeka. 
"I will teach you how to handle a sword better, while Washu can handle 
the hand to hand training." 
"Well Mom, I really don't think you can teach me anything, since Kagato 
taught me to..." 
"Who did you think taught ... him, My Little Ryoko?" answered Washu 
confidently. 
"You?!?! You can't be serious?" stated a disbelieving Ryoko. 
"Try me!"" said a smiling Washu who was in a combat stance.  
As Ryoko charged she simply ducked under her daughter, and drove her 
face first to the dirt floor  
of the training area. She continued to counter anything Ryoko did. When 
she became frustrated enough  
she generated her light sword. 
"Halt!" with the shout, all turned to Yousho who stopped Ryoko with 
that word.  
"When it comes to this Washu is almost as skilled as my aunt,  
and she is the head of the Emperor's Palace Guard." Said Yousho. 
"Then why do we need to know of hand to hand combat when we need skills 
that help with our light hawk wings."  
asked Tenchi. 
"That is part of those skills because you don't use the wings simply as 
a shield, or a sword.  
It can be used in other ways. For example Kai blasts, energy waves, and 
even being able to transport at an instant  
over parsecs of space." stated Yousho. 
"You mean you can do all that with the wings?" asked Ryoko. 
"And much more!" replied Washu. 
"Well we'd better get started," said Tenchi regretting that statement 
in within a minute.

Father's Apprehension, Mother's worry: 
Nobuyuki was worried. Not as much for his chances of being a father 
again,  
but more for Tenchi, his son.  
He knew that the path Tenchi has now chosen would mean an eventual move 
to Jurai.  
This worried his father simply because all parents want to protect 
their children  
and like any parent he was worried. As he thought of this Mihoshi 
quietly made little snoring  
noises as she slept in his arms.  
"I hope we all can get through this in one piece." Was all Nobuyuki 
could think of as he  
contemplated tomorrow's news. 
Washu was worried Ryoko shouldn't have been able to generate light hawk 
wings without her gems any more than  
Ayeka could. But, both did.Which caused her to worry some more for all 
three.  
"Now that their getting married I can't help but worry about them." was 
all Washu said as she lay in  
Yousho's arms as they witnessed the sunset that night. 
"Things have a way of working out, even without out influence, My 
Washu." 
"Where'd you learn that idea, lover?" 
"Back on Jurai, before I left." replied Yousho. 
"And that helps us, ... how?" asked a curious Washu. 
"By being observers and ready to help is better than sometimes doing 
the obvious." 
"Well I can't just let something's go, especially if they get hurt.  
I'm a mother, even though I haven't been a  one for a while, I can 
still  worry. It's my prerogative." said Washu. 
"Then, I can tell you that I'll be here to help you if needed." 
"Good. That is what a spouse does." 
"Yousho?" 
"Yes, dear?" 
"Are you worried about tomorrow?" 
"You mean should I worry about what my father will do?" 
"Yep, especially about the kids." 
"You mean Tenchi, don't you." 
She took his hand, "Will you father do something ... stupid?" 
"Washu, he hasn't kept the throne for so long just from dumb luck. He 
always approches any situation  
with a well thought out plan" 
"True!" said Washu. 
"So, he will not jeopardize his position if he tries something, as you 
put it, stupid." 
"Well that's settled." She snugggles closer to The now young looking 
Shrine priest.  
"Lets get back to the house for one of Sasami's fantastic dinners." 
"Yes, I may be eating for two you know!" 
"We'll find out tomorrow, but that doesn't change our plans." 
"Are you sure? No doubts?" Asked Washu. 
"I love you Washu Habuki, and that is no doubt true!" He gave her a 
long and loving kiss.
