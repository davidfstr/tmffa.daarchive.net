Ok I thought of a new idea for a series in Tenchi
Muyo.  Hopefully this one doesn’t blow.  Also I want
to do the disclaimer for this series in one episode.
Tenchi Muyo is not my property (thank god!  The
things I would have in mind for Ryoko and
Tenchi…) That and I'm stopping my series and
probably just get rid of them.


	Blaine: What?!

	Dan:  I’m stopping the your series as
of today.

	Blaine: It makes no sense!

	Dan: I ran out of ideas, does that make sense
for you now?

Blaine falls over and faints.

	Blaine: How did I ever get stuck with this
BAKA?


	Dan:  At any rate here is the series!


Tenchi Muyo!  No need for more characters.

	Episode #1 “Who the heck are you two?”

A space station orbiting around a large planet looking
like Jupiter docks all sorts of ships since it first
opened.  All sorts of ships can be found here just as
long as they paid their docking fees.  One ship is just
now docking.  The ship activates its thrusters and
stabilizes with the docking bay.  Inside this ship
sitting at the console is a woman with light gray hair,
red eyes with no conerae (she’s not human), and
about 18 years old.  A screen on her view screen
comes up.  An old man with a scar running down the
right side of his face addresses her.

	Old Man: Welcome to Ihsan’s Star.  How
long will you be staying?

	Woman:  Get me Ishan, tell him its Sheera
Reed.

	Old Man: Yes, hold on.
Soon the old man is replaced with the face of Ishan, a
sort of human but with a more bulky build.  Ishan
smiles and uploads the coordinates to a docking bay
for more famous ships.

	Ishan:  This one is on me, I’ll see you once
you’re off of that ship.

	Sheera:  Thanks, do you happen to know
where earth is?  I know it’s in this galaxy.

	Ishan: A new job?  I’ll help out as much as I
can, but you know what I want you to do in return.

	Sheera: [sweats] Do I have to take him?

	Ishan: Either that or pay for a VIP docking
pass.

	Sheera:  (Growl) All right, all right!  I’ll take
him along but if he gives me any grief I’ll gut him!

	Ishan:  Sheera you’re beautiful!

	Sheera:  [runs her hand through her hair]
Tell me something I don’t know! (Ha ha ha)

The ship docks and from the outside view we have
now it looks like a hybrid combination between
Mihoshi’s ship and Yagami but half the size of
Yagami.  Now we head to more familiar places,
namely Okayama Japan.  There, Tenchi is getting to
do what he rarely gets to do at all, relax.  Tenchi sits
down and opens his sketchbook.  The sun warms
Tenchi’s back, with little effort he finds inspiration
and starts to draw.  A small breeze ruffles the pages
of the sketchbook; Tenchi hears a light giggle
belonging to Ryoko Hakubi.

	Ryoko: I like this one better.

Few pages fly away to reveal a drawing of Tenchi
and her in bed sleeping together.

	Tenchi {sarcastically}: I wonder who drew
this one?

	Ryoko [As innocently as possible]: Me too.

Tenchi falls over and let’s a rueful sigh.  As he still
lies there Tenchi looks up at the sky to see a small
space ship being followed by a larger vessel.  |
Unknowing to them the larger vessel belongs to
Sheera |.  The small ship is hit by the bigger one’s
laser canons, the small ship’s rear engines blow up
and it starts a crash descent to earth.  The larger ship
satisfied with laying waste to the ship heads back to
outer space.  The small ship hits the earth making a
big explosion setting the surrounding forest on fire.

	Tenchi: Ryoko, get Ryo-Ohki here and have
her start putting the fire out!

	Ryoko: Got it!

Tenchi runs off to the crash site and Ryoko calls for
Ryo-Ohki via telepathic link.  Soon Ryo-Ohki is over
the forest drenching it with water from the lake.
Tenchi stands at an area still on fire; he can see the
ship that was purged from the sky.  Tenchi looks at
his right hand and twists the ring on it, his battle
armor phases on.

	Tenchi: I hope this armor is fire proof...

With that he leaps in to the blazing inferno and
remains unharmed.  Quickly Tenchi cuts his way into
the ship with Tenchi-ken looking for survivors. On
the floor is a young man drenched in blood, barely
still conscious he manages to call for help.  Tenchi
picks him up and puts him over his shoulder, now
Tenchi’s main concern is getting out before the
wreck explodes.  Ryoko teleports by Tenchi and
grabs him and the injured person and flies out of the
wreck and away just before it explodes one last time.
One hour later the fire is out, the stranger is in
Washu’s lab as she tends to his injuries.

Sasami is preparing dinner the wonderful smells waft
through all of the corners of the house, everyone Sits
at the table and eat.  Washu comes out of her lab with
a smile on her face; she takes her seat next to Sasami
and starts to eat.  Washu looks up from her plate to
see the group staring at her.

	Washu: What?

	Tenchi:  Is he ok?

	Washu: Oh, the complete stranger.  Yes he
is fine; right now he just needs some rest.

	Ryoko:  When will he wake up?  I have
some questions to ask.

	Washu:  By the way I see he must be
someone very disliked since he was chased here and
shot out of the sky.  I found some identification on
him; his name is Feng Tiannai.

	Ayeka: Feng Tiannai, what an odd name.


	Sasami:  What does the name mean
Katsuhito?

Katsuhito: Well, it means “Wolf - Sage”.

	Ryoko:  This Feng guy seems like trouble to
me.  We should get rid of him soon.

** In Washu’s lab with Feng Tiannai **


Feng wakes up slowly, still groggy from the
painkillers and sedatives.  Feng sits on the edge of the
medical table looking around for the person that had
taken care of his injuries.  Washu full from dinner
walks back into the lab and sees Feng sitting up on
the stretcher.

	Feng: Where am I?  I remember being the
wreck and somebody pulling me out of my ship.
Other than that I’m at a loss.  Who are you?

	Washu:  I am the universes greatest scientist,
Washu!

	Feng:  Washu, Washu, oh yes I remember.
You got kicked out of science academy for making
all of those weapons of mass destruction.

	Washu: [sweats] Yup that’s me.


	Feng:  Well it’s an honor to have the
universes greatest genius scientist as your doctor.
But I have one question.

	Washu: Ask.

	Feng:  How did I heal so fast?  With the best
medical science from space, I would still be laid out
for another seven days.

	Washu:  Well since you were severely hurt I
used an untested medical system.  In your circulatory
system and body, robots at a cellular level are
repairing the injuries you sustained.  Also I injected a
protein and antibiotic rich solution to speed up the
healing process.

	Feng: Amazing, what happens to the robots
when the work is finished?

	Washu:  They leave through the pores of
your skin and return to the sterilization chamber and
wait for any future use.

	Feng: Why don’t you submit these
inventions to science academy?  I’m sure that when
they see what you have accomplished they would
overlook your past and give you a position as a
professor.

	Washu: I like it here.  I just remembered
something; I need to check the lacerations on your
back.

	Feng: Ok.

Feng takes his torn shirt off and Washu puts on some
rubber gloves so she can take off the bloody
bandages.  When they were off the deep gashes
closed up well enough for them to remain uncovered
to continue to heal.  Washu finds a small tattoo wolf
and a barcode on the upper portion of his right
shoulder.

	Washu: Feng what does this tattoo
resemble?

	Feng: I don’t want to talk about it.

Satisfied that the wounds healed up well enough.
She brings up her console and takes down a few
quick notes on new revisions on the nano-bots in
Feng's body.  Feng gets off of the bed and looks
around for an exit.

	Washu:  Feng before you go, it might be
wise to get a change of clothes.

	Feng:  All of my possessions are in my ship.

	Washu:  Here.

Washu summons a second console for Feng.  On it
shown planet statistics, a clothing selection directory,
limited access to her database.  Feng finds some
favorite clothing.  From sub space the hole tosses out
carpenter jeans, work boots, a long sleeve shirt black
in color, lastly a leather trench coat.  Feng changes
into his new clothing and puts on his coat.

	Feng:  Do I look like the locals?

	Washu:  Yeah.  The door is right behind
you.  There is a young man, his name is Tenchi talk
to him and he’ll help as best as possible.

	Feng:  Thank you again.  Washu is there
anything I can do in return?

	Washu:  Yes, call me LITTLE Washu
please.

Feng face falters and heads for the door.  On the
other side waits Tenchi and the others.  Feng opens
the door on the other side Feng would receive the
most brutal interrogations in his life.  Ryoko and
Ayeka stop Feng in his tracks.

	Feng:  Excuse me ladies, I would like to get
through.

	Ayeka:  Not until you answer some of our
questions.

	Ryoko: First of all why were you blasted out
of the sky?

	Ayeka:  What are your intentions for staying
here?

	Feng:  Well I’ll tell you one thing.

Feng signals Ayeka and Ryoko to come closer, Feng
takes a deep breath.

	Feng [screams]: It’s none of your damn
business!

Ayeka and Ryoko fall over and faint.  Feng walks
over to Tenchi.

	Feng: You are Tenchi I presume.

	Tenchi: Yeah.

	Feng:  Thanks for pulling me out of that
heap of junk.  Can you show me where the ship
crashed?  I need to get my stuff out of there.

	Tenchi:  Let me just go get Tenchi-ken, I
need it to cut inside the hull of the ship.

Tenchi runs up to his room, Kiyone walks in to the
living room and finds the stranger taking this moment
she looked him over.  Charcoal black hair with gray
streaks at shoulder length.  Six feet seven inches tall.
Wolfish facial features and a thin beard with navy
blue eyes.  Feng turns around to see Kiyone looking
at him.

	Kiyone:  So you are the guy that crash-
landed.

	Feng:  The name’s Feng Tiannai.

	Kiyone:  Well Feng it’s nice to meet you.
Can you tell me as to how you got in that wreck?

	Feng:  All I want to say right now is that I
am not having the best of luck.

Tenchi had came downstairs; Feng was still looking
at Kiyone when she started to leave.  Feng sniffed the
air for a moment and turned to Tenchi.

	Tenchi: Why did you do that?

	Feng: Two reasons.  First I caught your
scent when we first met, and two I smell something
delicious.

	Tenchi: [sweats] That’s Sasami cooking,
she’ll have dinner ready when we get back from
salvaging stuff from your wreck.

	Feng: Ok, let’s go.

Tenchi and Feng went out the door and off to the
ravished ship.  Ayeka and Ryoko glare at Feng with
extreme mistrust, Feng returned the favor with an
equal icy glare that would make a stone cringe.  The
walk was very quiet, Tenchi decided to start a
conversation.

	Tenchi:  Feng why do you not like Ryoko
and Ayeka?  They are perfectly fine girls though they
are a bit strange.

	Feng:  For you they are.  I don’t abhor them;
it’s that the way those two treated me from the get go
just made me angry.  So which one do you like
better?

	Tenchi: Um, well they both have best
qualities.  Ryoko has that brash and sass manor, and
then Ayeka is very regal and carries her self easily.

	Feng:  So basically you can’t make up your
mind…

	Tenchi:  No.  I choose them both; I can’t
imagine life without one or the other.

	Feng: Hey there’s my ship!  Oh, man how
am I going to get home?!

Feng rummages through the fallen ship pulls out a
long metallic cylinder, Feng hid it underneath his
coat and resumed his search for anything that could
be brought back with him.  An hour later Feng found
a large box metallic just like the cylinder, on the top
of it had twelve buttons to enter a code so it would
open.  Feng punched four keys and it opened up to
reveal what is inside.  In it lay two energy pistols two
vintage dueling pistols, CDs of earth music and a CD
player with ear phones to play them, and lastly six
large bottles of cognac.  Tenchi looks at the CDs and
gets a bit confused; these artists are from America,
how did Feng get them out in space?

	Tenchi:  God Smack, Orgy, Smash Mouth,
jeez how did you get so many of these CDs if you
were in space?

	Feng:  I had someone get them for me.  I
heard about them when a human brought them with
him, I listened to them and I like what I heard.

	Tenchi:  Ok, why the booze?

	Feng:  Well, you never now when that stuff
comes in handy.  Good times, bad times, medicinal
and what not.

	Tenchi {Skeptical}: Right

Feng goes back to work finding more stuff that can
be taken back with him, this goes on for a few more
hours.  Both Feng and Tenchi call it quits for a day
and head home.  Feng pulls out the metal cylinder
and checks it for any damage.

	Tenchi:  So, what’s in there?

	Feng:  You really don’t want to know.

	Tenchi:  Come on.  It can’t be that bad.

	Feng:  I do not want to open it.  This is for
emergencies.

	Tenchi:  Fine.

They arrive at the house Ayeka and Ryoko are still
on the porch.  Feng stops and pulls out a bottle of
cognac and takes a long swig.

	Feng: I’m going to need this.  See what I
mean Tenchi, always a use.

	Tenchi: [face falters]…

	Feng:  What are these young ladies names, I
didn’t catch them when we first met.

	Ayeka & Ryoko: That’s because we didn’t
throw them.

	Feng: … Ok will you throw them now?
[Veins popping out]

	Ayeka:  Princess Ayeka of Jurai.  While stay
you here I suggest you not try anything.

	Ryoko:  I’m the most feared and powerful
space pirate.

	Feng:  So, you’re from the Jurai Royal
family.  (Tsk) I can’t wait until I get outta here.

	Ayeka: What’s that supposed to mean?

	Feng:  Do you remember the planet
Antioch?  Probably not, Jurai only remembers the
best things they did and not the worst.

	Ayeka:  Jurai has taken the means to reverse
all the damage!  The freed slaves are now being
recompensed!

	Feng:  Can you recompense me for my
losses?!  Can you bring back my family I lost?  I
hardly think so.

Feng walks back in the house and into Washu’s lab.
Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka are left completely
shocked.

** In the lab**

	Feng:  Hey Washu where are you?

	Washu:  What is it?  I’m busy.

	Feng:  Is there any place I can get some rest
for the night?

	Washu:  You just don’t want to show your
face for a while because you blew up at Ayeka.
What a shame, you are here for only five hours and
you put the wrong impression on the two most
powerful women in the house.

	Feng:  I’m sorry for acting the way I did but,
when I think of Jurai, all that pain and suffering
comes back.

	Washu:  Oh poor you!  You think that the
entire universe is set against just you?  I had my first
child taken away from me!

	Feng:  I’m sorry for that Washu.  I guess we
are the same in a sense, we know what’s like to lose
loved ones but you have something special.  You
have Tenchi and Ryoko.

	Washu:  What?

	Feng:  Isn’t Ryoko your daughter?  Then
there is Tenchi; you treat him like a son when you’re
not testing him.

	Washu: How did you know that?  Wait,
have you been in orbit watching us?

	Feng: Yes.  I was watching you for the past
few days and when I was attacked the autopilot made
a crash landing course here after it took too much
damage.  One thing I forgot to bring up, can you
spare some room for me?

	Washu:  I have limitless space for all my
projects and inventions.  I’m sure I can make room
up for you.  On one condition though.

	Feng:  Name it.

	Washu:  I want to run some tests on you.

	Feng:  Fine.

Washu summons her holo-computer and Feng is
poked, prodded, and scanned for hours.


	** In the living room after dinner**

Tenchi and the others sit down in the living room to
discuss the visitor.

	Tenchi:  Ayeka can you tell me what exactly
happened to this planet called Antioch?

	Ayeka:  That was not the best moment in
Jurai’s history.  Two hundred years ago Antioch was
an allied planet, it was attacked by a planet Virago.
We could not afford to stop the raid on the planet
because we were recovering from a dehabilitating
rebellion.  Planet Virago was home to a race of
powerful and highly technological race of aquatic
people.  They took every living person on Antioch
and made him or her, a slave on Virago.  This took
twenty years for the Viragos to enslave the
Antiocians.  When we were capable of going to
rescue the Antiociancs the Emperor deemed that we
not bother to go save them.  Ten years ago my father,
Emperor Suza took his fleet of Jurai ships and made a
blockade around the planet demanding the release of
the people of Antioch.  He was successful but our
friendship with the Antiocians has been very
unsteady.

	Ryoko:  So, Jurai is not such a perfect world
after all.

	Ayeka:  Silence demon!

The door to the lab opens and Washu comes out
making her appearance to reassure that she is still
alive.

	Tenchi:  Where is Feng?

	Washu:  In a room I prepared for him
getting drunk.

	Feng:  Heh, I wish I could get drunk but I
can’t.  I have something to do.

Feng walks to Ayeka and bows respectfully.

	Feng: Lady Ayeka, I Feng Tiannai ask for
your forgiveness for my rash behavior and comments
earlier.

	Ayeka:  You need not worry yourself, I only
wish Jurai could have assisted you when it first
happened.

	Ryoko:  So you were a slave, what did you
do?

	Feng:  Well after they beat me, I would do
pretty much anything I was told to do.  The most I
want to remember was the slave fights for special
privileges.

	Tenchi: What do you mean special
privileges?

	Feng: Extra food, a better bed to sleep in or
a better working position.  I fought very hard and for
a long time so I could get my family a good place to
work.

	Washu:  What did happen to them?

	Feng:  There was a woman named Sheera
Reed, a very spoiled girl.  She wanted me to be her
special pet.  For the first few times I simply said no,
but she found my family and took them threatening to
kill them.  I finally consented; Sheera let them go
back to work.  One night I slept with Sheera obeying
her demands, her boyfriend caught us in the act.  He
knew who I was and he set out to kill my family
painfully slow.  He came back and beat me
throughout the whole night.  The next morning Jurai
came and set free all of the Antiocians.  Funny isn’t it
I strive to protect the ones I hold dear from death and
on the day my kind was set free they were dead and
all I got was empty condolences and my freedom.

Feng looks down at the floor and sighs painfully.
Ryoko and Ayeka are completely blown away by all
the hardship this guy had went through.  Ryoko knew
what it was like to be used as a toy and enslaved but
this was just too much for her.  Feng lifts his eyes and
gazes around the room.

	Feng: But I know my family is finally free,
free from all the awful things in life and are resting
peacefully.

Feng gets up to leave the living room and outside to
take a walk.  Tenchi heads upstairs to go to bed
everyone else retreats to his or her rooms to get some
sleep.

	** In Tenchi’s room while he is dreaming.
>From his point of view. **

Laying down still awake I think about all that has
happened in just a short amount of time, a new
person has came into our lives.  He told me of the
worst times he went through but, what about the
best?  I think they are too few for him.  Better not
give it any more thought, if he wants to talk to me
then he will make the effort not me.  Jeez I’m not
even tired; bored I start counting sheep in my mind.
One, two, three … six hundred fifty one.  Out like a
lamp.  I start to dream.  Now there is a forest as far as
the eye could see.  Inside I can hear sword fighting;
curious I go in the forest to investigate.

	Feng: I won’t let you near Tenchi!

	Woman:  Heh heh.  I’m sorry lover but I
have to do what I’m paid for!

I’m not even too deep in the forest and I found the
battle.  This woman seems to be slightly better than
Feng in sword skill.  Feng wielding a strange sword
kind of exoskeleton had grafted itself onto his hand
and started to shine light blue.

	Feng: Ahhhh!

The sword pulsated from its original black color to
the light blue, Feng with all of his might charged the
woman.  Soon Ryoko and Ayeka were here to help
Feng out.

	Ryoko:  Feng, blast you!  Why can’t you
just ask for help when you get in these fights?!

	Feng:  Ryoko, now is not the time!

	Ayeka: Listen whoever you are, leave now
and we will not destroy you!

The woman knocks Feng to the ground and smirks.

	Woman:  Feng, you never told them about
me? I am Sheera Reed, Feng’s girlfriend.

	Feng:  Don’t make me laugh!  I only bedded
a spoiled slut to save my family but they got killed
anyway!

Sheera grabs Feng by the throat, Ryoko blasted her
and Sheera dropped Feng.  Feng held his throat trying
to get air to his lungs.  Ryoko grinned at getting her
attention.

	Sheera: You want to play?  Ok then, catch!

Sheera’s wrists opened and quills flew out, Ryoko
dodged every volley with ease.  Sasami was the last
but not the least as Washu, Kiyone and Mihoshi.

	Sasami:  I won’t let you take Tenchi!

	Kiyone: You are obviously outnumbered so
give up.

	Sheera:  I can kill you all with one arm tied
behind my back, I just want Tenchi.  It is time he met
Tokemi.

	Sasami: No!

Sasami created a white sphere of focused chi and
hurled it towards Sheera.  Sheera went through it and
took Sasami hostage.  I couldn’t stand doing nothing
anymore; I had to save Sasami.

	Tenchi: Stop!  I’m right here, let Sasami go
and I’ll take her place.

	Sheera: Fair enough.

I walk towards Sheera as she lets Sasami go.  Feng
with the last remnants of his strength leapt towards
Sheera making a suicidal attack.  Sasami was far
away and in the arms of Ayeka, Sheera fired a large
quill in his chest making Feng stop in midair and land
on the ground with a lifeless thud.  Kiyone rushed to
his side Ryoko very worried teleported to him also.

	Kiyone: Oh god!  Feng are you ok?

	Ryoko:  Hang on pal, Washu will fix you up
and you can get back to making me mad.

	Feng: I’ll be ok.  All I need is some
rest...

	Kiyone:  Feng, Feng?! NOOOO!

I am tied up in energy rings and lifted away.  Ryoko
flies to me trying to save but she is knocked down to
the earth.

	Ryoko:  Tenchi!

I had to wake up; I have to make sure that everyone
is ok.  Instantly I wake up screaming.



This ends the first episode. I hope this was good
because I try very hard to keep things as realistic as
possible.  I have some Ideas for the next episode but
one important thing I would to say is in the next
episode is Tenchi finds out what Tsunami also
blessed him with instead the light hawk wings.
