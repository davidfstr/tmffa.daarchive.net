     Goddess wars! part1 A new friend by Jwhitman    

 It was a peaceful fall afternoon, Tenchi was raking leafs as 
usually then a figure appeared behind him and threw her arms 
around his neck and said
"Hello Tenchi.""Hi Ryoko."said Tenchi.Then Ryoko started 
whispering in his ear and as she went on Tenchi's face became 
redder and redder.(Washu's Lab)"Oh
no" Washu said"The Time/Space continuam has open up again" said 
Washu. (Our world It was 5:30 "oh great now i'm bored"said Jordan.
"What the...." he said as he fell in a black void.(the Tenchi 
universe)Tenchi & Ryoko looked up to where they heard the yelling 
come to see a person yelling"LOOK
OUT!"Ryoko quickly teleported her and Tenchi onto the roof right 
when Jordan hit the ground hard "Ouch"said Ryoko.When they got to 
Jordan he was bleeding badly."We
should take him to Washu."said Tenchi right before Jordan went 
unconscious.(2 days later)everybody had just finish lunch and 
where about to leave but stoped when they
herd a explosion.Washu said"Oh great"and ran in her lab and when 
she got there she saw a figure standing in the middle of the 
fire."Is this the way to thank your
mom,Jordan"said Washu changing into her adult form. "What!your are 
not and how did you know my name."said Jordan."Yes i am because 
you were dead and i brought
you back to life,so i am"Washu said"That still does not make you 
my mom"said Jordan"i guess then that makes me your creator and i 
looked in your memories and
erased them."said Washu."so,if your my creator then i'm not 
completely human. "said Jordan.A few minutes later Washu and 
Jordan came out of Washu's Lab,everyone
introduced themselves then Washu asked to talk to him."I need to 
tell you something"said Washu "What is it"said Jordan "When i 
brought you back i gave you some
powers."said Washu"Wow!Really what are they"said Jordan"The power 
to fly and control energy"said Washu"Wow!"said Jordan"Try them 
out"said Washu."I don't know
how to"said Jordan."O.k.i'll help you."said Washu.(The next moring 
4:00)"Since i was up all last night i guess i'll watch the 
sunrise" said Jordan as he walked out of the
house.He did not notice Asaka & Kamidake grading the gate."hmm.I 
wonder what where i am"said Jordan to himself."Hey i didn't even 
notice that i was speaking
Japanese.So i guess i am in Japan.Well i guess i'll look for the 
sunrise."said Jordan."I think the sunrise is west,Sir"said 
Kamidake"Oh thanks who are you"said Jordan "I
am Kamidake"said Kamidake"And i am Asaka,we are the gaurdins of 
pricess Ayeka "Okay,Well nice to meet you."Jordan said starting 
fly up in the air."Oh,what is your
name."said Kamidake"My name is Jordan"he said trying out his 
second power.He concentrated and his body was engulfed by a white 
fire and he flew off."Did you just see
him on fire and fly off?"questioned Asaka"Maybe he is a demon like 
Ryoko"answered Kamidake"Maybe"replied Asaka.Jordan was out by the 
lake trying to get better at
controlling energy.He flew up over the lake and raised one arm and 
stuck out his index finger and a little orange and yellow ball 
formed a few inches from his finger.He let it
get bigger a little bit and pointed it at the lake and the ball 
headed for lake.A few mintinues later the ball hit the lake bottom 
and the ground shaked violently throughout 8
miles.It woke everyone up and they ran (Ryoko took her shortcut 
and teleported)outside to see what was wrong.When they got there 
they saw Jordan balancing a huge ball
of energy on his finger.Ryoko shot an energy bolt out of her hand 
and when it hit the ball the ball exploded send Jordan flying."He 
landed on the roof"said Sasami running
into the house.(a few moments later)Everybody was on the roof "You 
could at lest tell me that it was to big and i would've send it 
into space"said Jordan in a weak voce"Are
you going to be okay"said Tenchi"yeah just stand back"said 
Jordan.Jordan closed his eyes to concentrate.All of sudden his 
body jumped.He stood up and
said"Taada".Everyone was clapping even baby Mayuka.(later that 
day)Tenchi was working in the fields and Jordan was helping 
him."Hey Tenchi"said Jordan "What is it
Jordan?"he asked "which girl do you like Ryoko or Ayeka"asked 
Jordan"I don't know i really don't want to hurt either of them,i 
can't even get things strait in my head"said
Tenchi."Then i will help you"said Jordan as he got up and stuck 
his hand on Tenchi's forehead"Just think about each girl one at a 
time" said Jordan.Tenchi started to think
about Kiyone after a few moments Jordan said "Okay you think of 
Kiyone as a close friend,Now think about Mihoshi then Sasami then 
Washu."Tenchi did so and after a
few moments Jordan said"Hmm,so far you think of everyone as 
family,well time for Ayeka."Tenchi did so and after a few 
mintinues later Jordan said Okay,now think about
Ryoko"a few minutes later Jordan said "What the ...." but he was 
cut off by a shock that ran through his body."Someone is blocking 
something "he said.He got up and put
his hand on Tenchi's forehead this time a white fire covered both 
of them"That's it"he said as he took his hand off of Tenchi's 
forehead and the fire disapeered"There was
something blocking your true feelings for someone close to 
you."said Jordan right before Ryoko teleported into the fields."Oh 
hi Ryoko you came just in time Tenchi needed
to tell you something"he said as he walked off."What is it 
Tenchi?"Ryoko asked sitting beside him."Ryoko i love you."
