most wonderful anime, Tenchi Muyo. I am nothing more than a fan who loves
to write about the posibilities and take the original story a bit further.
So, once again, I'm not an emplyoee at ACI or Pioneer just a fan who is
very poor. (So no sueing please...thank you)

			Chapter 2: Evil Meets Evil

	Night fell around the Masaki homestead and everyone sat at the 
diner table. Ryoko gobbled up the food while trying to get Tenchi's 
attention and making Ayeka jealous. Mihoshi and Sasami stayed out of it and
Yosho just sat and laughed. Washu however didn't eat too much. She sat and 
stared out into space. Sasami looked over, noticing Washu had not 
touched her food and frowned a little.
	"Washu, are you okay?" Samami asked staring at Washu's blank 
expresion. Washu shook her head as if coming out of a daze and looked at 
Sasami.
	"Oh, sorry, I guess I'm just not hungry," she replied plainly and 
walked off into her lab. The others watched her walk off strangly.
	"Well, you'd think she would eat once and a while after staying in 
that lab for so long," Ayeka grumbled. Ryoko got up and walked to the door 
and out her hand up to it. She fazzed through the door with everyone but
Yosho watching. 
	Washu sat at her computer pushing buttons as if still hypnotized
by a strange force. Ryoko floated behind her and looked down.
	"Whats wrong?" she asked and Washu jumped out off of her seat.
	"Don't scare me like that again!" she yelled and Ryoko looked at 
her strangly.
	"I...scared you?"
	"Well, I was hard at work and completely focused on my experiment
until you came in and startled me, you really shouldn't do that to your
poor mother."
	"Sorry mom!"
	"Now, what did you need?"
	"I wanted to ask you what in the hell is wrong, I'm your daughter,
you should tell me." Washu turned her back and looked down.
	"If you go and get everyone, I will tell you everything." Ryoko 
nodded and fazzed back through the door. Washu kept her back turned away 
from the door a while before walking back to her pillow and sitting down.
Ryoko came back into the lab and everyone came in.
	"Please everyone, sit," Washu said and chairs popped up from the 
ground. Everyone sat and looked toward Washu who sat on her pillow before 
them. 
	"Okay Washu, whats this all about?" Ryoko asked nearly yelling.
	"All right, I will tell you, but remember, after you hear this 
information, you must know what has to be done, but I am unsure if we could 
do it."

	Galvitros flew through a meteor shower, having meteors hit the 
energy shields in front of the craft. Atmos sat inside and watched the 
monitors with heavy eyes. His eyes closed and he drifted off to sleep.
	He was soon in a dream standing in a white room. He looked at his
hands and noticed his armor was still on. He walked about the room until 
coming to a door. He sweated a bit and gripped the handle. His muscles 
tightened a bit as he looked up to the door.
	'I feel a strange energy coming from behind this door, I have never
felt an energy such as this,' he thought while gripping the handle and 
putting a hand up to the door. 'Well, here goes nothing.' 
	He turned the handle and pushed the oak door open. The world he 
stepped was a surrealistic wonderland of beauty. Full of brilliant flower
fields and a single tree on a hill. Atmos looked up at the tree and 
scratched his head. 
	"I swear I remember this place, but I don't know," he told 
himself and began to make a trek across the field to the tree. He passed
butterflies flying all over the place and countless colors in endless 
shades. He finally made it to the tree and was shocked to find a boy under
the tree. He was very small and feeble looking. His face was burried in his
arms as he looked to the ground only his long silver hair showed. Atmos 
walked a little closer to the child and noticed something in the 
distance.
	"That...that building...I know that place," he said then he gasped.
"My god! its the Royal Space Acadamy, then this is." He looked down to the
boy who now raised his head. He had red eyes and a ice blue face. He wore a 
blue jacket with a black tie and a white shirt underneath. Black pants and 
shoes completed the outfit. The small boy got up and looked down at the 
acadamy and smirked.
	"This is me," Atmos said and then realized something. "I remember
this day, this is the day I was..." Before he completed his sentance the
boy was suddenly lifted into the sky and the scenery changed. There was no
more grass or tree or anything. It was now a black, malevolent nothingness.
Then the boy appeared behind Atmos.
	He turned to see him unconscious and in the arms of the most 
powerful being of all. His eyes followed the arms all the way up to confirm
his deduction.
	"Tokimi," he said and Tokimi smiled. She waved her hand over the 
child and he was levitated. A white ball swirled around him as his hair 
turned from silver to black. He opened his eyes which were aglow with fire.
Atmos watched the transformation, beginging to end until the boy was set
down on the ground. He looked at his hands then at Tokimi. 
	"My lady," he said bowing. Tokimi smiled and then patted the small
child on the head.
	"You will be my ultimate weapon, I have seen the darkness in your 
heart and brought it out for you to recognize your true potential," she 
explained.
	"I thank you for this offer my lady."
	"Now, if you do me a favor I will let you keep your power."
	"Is it Washu?"
	"Yes, I would like to meet with her."
	"Of course." The boy disappeared and Tokimi smiled. 
	"Now, I will soon have what I need." She said and dissapeared too. 
The whole place faded and twisted all together and spiraled out of 
proportions. Weird shapes flew past Atmos everywhere inside the twisting 
tunnel and a light showed at the end. He was soon engulfed in the light and
a burning sensation soon came.
	Atmos snapped awake from his sleep and looked at the monitors. He
rubbed his eyes and found he was still a little far away from Tokimi so he
got up and walked back to his quarters to sleep the rest of the way.

	Everyone looked at each other in worry as Washu finished her grim 
tale. They all shared the same expression and the same thoughts.
	"So, that energy surge and that comet were all because of him?" 
Ryoko asked.
	"Yes, the energy surges were of him escaping his coffin the of him
reviving his ship," Washu explianed. "Then that comet was deffinatly him
spying on us." 
	"So what your saying is that there may be no chance of us even 
beating him," Tenchi said.
	"No, not with the power he obtained."
	"Are you sure, what about Tsunami's power?" Ayeka asked.
	"Yeah, Tsunami could do it!" Sasami chimed in and Ryo-Ohki meowed in
agreement.
	"No, no, no, I don't think Tsunami could do it either, we are 
talking about a major power," Washu replied.
	"Damn!" Ryoko yelled and punched her open palm. " I should have 
blasted him when he was in the atmosphere."
	"Ryoko, you felt his power, you know good and well that he could 
wipe out the Earth with the snap of his finger," Ayeka retorted.
	"And I supose Jurai could withstand a few hits huh?"
	"Well, since you asked..."
	"Don't even start, this guy is a monster compared to me and just
look at the damage I caused. If I could do that, he wouldn't have too much
trouble."
	"All right, thats enough, we need to concentrate on the matter at
hand," Tenchi told Ayeka and Ryoko.
	"We're sorry," both of them said.
	"Washu, where do you think he is going?" Tenchi asked.
	"I have no idea, it could be anywhere."
	"Wait, do you think it could be Tokimi?" Ryoko asked. Washu 
dwelled on the question a bit then responded.
	"That is a posibility, but why Tokimi."
	"Does he think he could get something to aid him to destroy Jurai or
possibally kill Tenchi?"
	"That we don't know, I think the only thing we can do at this 
moment is wait and see what happens.

	Galvitros rumbled and beeped as it neared Tokimi's palace. The 
shakes awoke Atmos and he sat up on his bed. He looked about and walked to 
the cockpit. He watched as they neared the palace. 
	"Ah, finally, I have my chance to see Tokimi face to face. Hmm, I
wonder if that annoying D3 is still there. Oh well, I suppose I'll just 
have to find out," he said and he warped out of the ship and onto the 
floating platform. It traveled down the watered pathway toward the chamber
of Tokimi. 
	It fianlly arrived and Atmos stepped off. He looked at the giant 
doors that seperated him from his fate. He smiled and laguhed.
	"It seems the chamber has been modified a little since I last 
came," he said and he pushed on the huge doors opening them up to an empty
room. Atmos walked in and looked around. 
	"Tokimi, where are you hiding Tokimi!" The large floating head known
as D3 appeared and stared at Atmos.
	"Why are you here?" D3 asked.
	"I'm just here to see Tokimi, after all it has been about twenty-
three thousand years and I would love to see how she's doing."
	"You have been banished from this quadrant and you dare to come 
back."
	"Yep, guilty as charged." D3 scowled at Atmos but then lightened up
after a small rumble was heard.
	"Of course my lady, you would like to speek privatly," D3 responded
and disappeared. Suddenly, Tokimi appeared in the flesh and looked down 
upon Atmos. 
	"Why are you here, traitor?" she asked seriously.
	"I'm just here to tell you that I found Washu, if your not 
interested I guess I could just leave and have someone else go and get her."
	"You realize I could have killed you out there, and that you took
a great risk by coming."
	"So why didn't you kill me?"
	"You carried a message, I didn't want precious information to be 
lost because of a careless action."
	"Well, heres everything..."
	"You don't need to explain, I can already see your plan."
	"Then you will break the seal."
	"Only if I get Washu."
	"No problem, my lady," he said and bowed a then walked out of the
chamber.
