  Outside the Masaki household birds were singing, the sun was shining,
it was a beautiful day, but inside everything was in confusion. Everyone
had been shocked when at dinner last night Ryoko had announced that she
would be going with Tenchi to school when it started in the morning.
*         *          *       *     *          *          *            * 
  Ryoko walked alongside Tenchi with a big smile on her face, she had
Washu make up a fake I.D. and Washu also took away her power of flight
and energy swords etc. in case she got too excited.
  Tenchi was slightly worried about Ryoko coming to his school, since
the last time she blew it up and then he was worried about how the boys
might react and then what Ryoko would do to them. 
    When they got inside every boy in the school was drooling when they
saw Ryoko walk in, some of the girls stood glaring at her as their
boyfriends were found crowding around her. They walked to the
principal's office where a teacher took Ryoko to the room she would be
tested in. Tenchi then left and headed for his class.

  The principal sat in his office with the Dean of Students looking over
Ryoko's grade's for the sixth time. "This can't be right she got
straight A's on all her math and science subjects and didn't need to
work anything out! "The principal said.   
  "Maybe she cheated" stated the Dean.  
  "No she only got average on her English and Social Science exams and I
was there she only had the exams and a pen."
"Well the teacher for her class said he would watch her we'll know if
there is anything going on."

It was lunchtime and Ryoko was not having a fun time as a group of boys
chased her down the hall. Suddenly someone grabbed her and pulled her
into an empty classroom, she whirled around to see three girls around
seventeen. The one who grabbed her was tall, had long straight blue
hair, green eyes and a tan complexion. The second girl stood in the back
of the room and was, had had short black hair that she wore out, black
eyes and a dark complexion. The last girl was of average height, had
short auburn hair witch she kept in a ponytail, brown eyes and a light
complexion. 
  The first girl smiled and said, "I see you have problems with girl
crazy perverts too," Ryoko nodded. "My name is Amy. The short one is Gia
and the other one is Raquel."
"Who is she?" Raquel asked, "She's in our class right?"
"My name is Ryoko, this is my first day here, I sit next to Tenchi." The
girls turned around to stare at Ryoko and she then noticed that they had
been talking in another language and s had she.
"You know English?" the girls said I unison.
"Uh. I traveled a lot when I was younger so learned some different
languages, but how do you know English? "She said which wasn't a total
lie.
"Our original language is English we taught ourselves Japanese from
books we just moved here a while ago from Nassau, Bahamas where we were
born." Amy answered.
Gia walked up from the back of the room and said "Hey Ryoko we were just
heading out to the cafeteria when Amy pulled you in wanna come with us?"
"Sure!" So the group of new friends walked to the cafeteria

Tenchi was sitting down in the caf wondering where Ryoko was. One of his
old friends Kevin came and sat down across from him "Hey Tenchi where's
your girlfriend?"
"Ryoko is not my girlfriend Kevin we are just good friends"
"Well it sure looks like she's your girlfriend she always sits next to
you and she lives in the same HOUSE as you...well speak of the devil
here she is now, and look who's with her it's the girls who came here
couple years ago they are weird."
"Just because they reject any boy who wants to date that does not make
them weird." Just then Ryoko and her friend sat at the table.
"Hi Tenchi these are my new friends Amy, Raquel and Gia."
"Hi" the three girls said in unison.
"Hi, Ryoko this is my old friend Kevin we played together when we were
kids."
Ryoko remembered Tenchi would sometimes bring his friend by the cave
when they were little. "Yeah and I went to his old school too until it
mysteriously exploded".
Tenchi looked very nervous when Kevin said that, what would he think if
he ever found out Ryoko had blown up the school.
*      *         *       *           *           *          
 School was over and Tenchi and Ryoko had just gotten home they had
dinner then Ryoko headed for the lab. She entered the lab and spotted
Washu "Washu I need to ask you something." Washu sat there ignoring her.
Ryoko sighed, "Mom."
 Washu turned around to Ryoko and smiled "Oh, hello little Ryoko I
didn't hear you come in. How was school."
  "It was fine I made some friends Amy, Gia and Raquel."
  "Those are English names aren't they?"
  "On that point, they started speaking in English and I understood them
and replied to them."
  "You have the ability to translate any language or don't you remember
you did not speak Japanese before you came here."
 Ryoko thought back to her time on the Souja, she couldn't remember much
but she remembered that Kagato had spoken in Jurian and so had she.
 "You remember now?" Ryoko nodded in reply. "Now," Washu stood up and
looked at Ryoko. "You need to get some sleep, I can't have you falling
asleep in class."
  Ryoko left the lab smiling she really did care for her mother although
she would never admit it aloud.

Tokimi sat on her throne as a robed figure entered the room. "Lady
Tokimi you requested my presence?"
 "Yes I have a mission for you, I want you to go to Earth and retrieve
my sisters, they have neglected their duties for too long." 
 "What if there is any resistance?"
   "Your only concern is to bring back Tsunami and Washu, do what you
want with the rest."
 "Yes my Lady." The robed figure then exited the room
"I will find what you are hiding sisters."
