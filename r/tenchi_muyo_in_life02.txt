TENCHI MUYO IN LIFE PART II

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DISCALMER:  I do not own all the characters like Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, 
Mihoshi, and so on in this fanfic, or anything that is own by AIC and 
Pioneer.  Well except for Commander Henrii Lok.  I do not want a lawsuit 
because I just can’t afford to pay that much money.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NO NEED FOR ICE PACK
Early in the morning Ryoko slowly walk to Tenchi’s wall.  Ryoko thought to 
herself, I would jump onto Tenchi’s bed and see if Ayeka would come in to 
see Tenchi and me in his bed.  I will show that Tenchi and I made love and 
she would leave and I would have Tenchi all by myself.  She walked into 
Tenchi’s room and didn’t see Henrii on the floor sleeping.  Ryoko step on 
Henrii crotch and Henrii’s let out and cry of pain.  Ryoko panicked and 
jumped on Tenchi’s bed.  Ayeka immediately woke up and ran to Tenchi’s door 
and took off the trap she placed and threw it to the floor that was on 
Tenchi’s door and ran in.  Ayeka saw Ryoko in Tenchi’s bed and ran up to 
Tenchi’s bed and stepped on Henrii’s crotch.  Henrii let another cry of 
pain.  Mihoshi and Sasami ran in to find out what happened.  Both of the 
girls didn’t see Henrii on the floor and both of them steps on Henrii’s 
crotch and tried to pull Ayeka away from Ryoko neck.
“Let me kill this demon with my bear hands Sasami!” cried out Ayeka.
“No Ayeka you mustn’t!” replied Sasami.
“Yeah Ayeka and why is Ryoko in his room anyway?” questioned Mihoshi.
“For your information Mihoshi I was making love with Tenchi,” said Ryoko.
“Making love bah you weren’t near his room till this morning,” said Henrii 
in a high tone voice.
“What… umm he is lying!  I made beautiful love with Tenchi!” said Ryoko
“I would know that you were making love with Tenchi but you didn’t,” 
answered Henrii.
“You are so lame Ryoko now you are lying that you are making love with 
Tenchi,” laughed Ayeka.  Ryoko gave Henrii an evil stare.
“Hey Henrii are you alright down there?” asked Tenchi
“Yeah just couldn’t believe that four girls didn’t know I was down here and 
they all stepped on my crotch!” replied Henrii.  Henrii got up and look in 
his pants.
“Do any of you guys have ice that I can have?” asked Henrii
“I will get it said Sasami!” said Sasami cheerfully.
“Thank you Sasami,” said Henrii and winked at her.  Sasami blushed and ran 
downstairs.
“Get off of Lord Tenchi this minute!”  Said Ayeka.
“Make me then!” answered Ryoko. Mihoshi and Henrii went downstairs and sat 
on the couch and turned on the TV.  All of a sudden a loud boom was heard.
“They seem to fight all day long,” said Henrii.
“Here you go Henrii, a ice pack!” said Sasami.
“Thanks Sasami,” said Henrii and Ryo-Ohki jumped off of Sasami’s head and 
landed on Henrii’s lap.
“Hi there, what’s your name?” said Henrii.
“Miya Miya Miya,” answered Ryo-Ohki,
“Her name is Ryo-Ohki, Henrii.  Ryo-Ohki this is Henrii,” smiled Sasami.
“Miya Miya Miya Miya,” said Ryo-Ohki.  Henrii placed his hand on Ryo-Ohki 
and started to pet her.
“I think she like you Henrii,” giggled Sasami.
“Yeah, I think so,” said Henrii.
“What going on up there! I can’t even hear myself think!” said Washu.
“I think they blew up another wall Washu,” said Sasami,
“Yeah I think so too,” said Mihoshi.
“Meow meow meow meow,” said Ryo-Ohki
“Ok I will get the wall maker 2000 from my lab,” said Washu.
“You have a lab!” Henrii said as he got up and Ryo-Ohki fell onto the floor 
and the ice pack landed on her.
“Oh sorry Ryo-Ohki,” said Henrii as he moved the ice pack and pickup up 
Ryo-Ohki and kisses her on her head and placed her on the couch.
“Miya miya!” said Ryo-Ohki
“Was that an ice pack on your penis?” Washu smiled.
“Umm err yeah, but anyway can I go into your lab? Please,” said Henrii.
“Did you have a rough night, Henrii?”  Washu said with a big grin.
“NO! I didn’t have a rough night!” replied Henrii.
“Ok you can come into my lab,” said Washu.
“Alright!” said Henrii.
“Mihoshi don’t enter or I will turn you into something that has a same brain 
pattern as you,” said Washu.
“I can enter lab! Thank you Washu!” said Mihoshi as Sasami, Washu, Henrii, 
and even Ryo-Ohki had big sweat drops coming from their heads.
“Umm Mihoshi, Washu said don’t enter her lab,” said Henrii.
“Oh ok!” said Mihoshi and sat back down and watch the another television 
show.  Washu entered her lab and Henrii was about to enter until Tenchi came 
down and asked him a question.
“Hey Henrii where are you going?” said Tenchi
“Well I going to Washu’s lab.  Where are you going?”
“I’m going to go outside to farm for some more carrots for Ryo-Ohki.”
“Ryo-Ohki is that cat and rabbit creature right?”
“Yep she eats a lot of carrots a day.  It’s one of her most favorite foods.”
“Oh,” said Henrii.  Ayeka and Ryoko walked close to Tenchi.
“You are so mean to our guest Ryoko!”  said Ayeka.
“Oh yeah!” said Ryoko as she pushed Ayeka into Tenchi and Tenchi pushed 
Henrii into Washu’s lab.
“Oh Tenchi!  I didn’t see you!” said Ryoko as she pushed away Ayeka from 
Tenchi’s body.
“Where did Henrii go?” said Tenchi.
“Breakfast is ready,” said Sasami.
“I think he went into the lab,” said Mihoshi.
“Oh all right,” said Tenchi.
“Get your grubby hands away from Lord Tenchi!” Said Ayeka
“Oh yeah make me!” said Ryoko.
“Azaka! Kamidake!” cried out Ayeka.
“Yes your highness!” said Azaka and Kamidake.
“Take care of Ryoko over there!” said Ayeka pointing to Ryoko
“Why me!” said Tenchi.

NO NEED FOR CARROTS
Inside Washu lab Washu was already typing something up on her computer and 
sitting on her floating pillow. The door flung open and Henrii was moving 
too fast that he needed something to grab hold onto or he will fall down.  
He grabs something soft and red and dragged it down with him.
“Oh no!” said Henrii
“Ahhhhhhh you got my hai...!” said Washu.  And a loud crash on the floor.  
Henrii’s face was between Washu’s legs and Washu’s head landed on top 
Henrii’s crotch.
“Awww ouch!” cried Henrii.
“Henrii you grabbed my beautiful hair!” said Washu.
“Sorry Washu but would you get off my crotch!” said Henrii.
“And you should stop staring between my legs!” said Washu as she closed her 
legs with a lot of force and got up.  Henrii got up holding his crotch and 
his nose.
“That hurt!” said Henrii
“Well you deserved it when you were staring at between my legs!” said Washu 
as she got back to her computer typing.
“What are you doing Little Washu?” asked Henrii.
“Creating something.”
“Oh ok.”
“Do you have an extra computer I can use Little Washu?”
“Yeah let me type down some commands to make you one, ok.”
“Thanks Little Washu.”  A portal opened and out comes a computer just as 
similar as Washu’s computer.
“There you go enjoy.  Be good on the internet!” smiled Washu.  Henrii sat on 
the floor thinking.  What should I invent this time. I got it, a special 
gene to make carrots grow faster and larger.  As Henrii was making his 
special gene for carrots.  Washu laugh with delight.
“I did it! I just figured out how to freeze time.”
“That nice,” said Henrii as he was punching in some commands on the computer 
and a portal opened and dropped him a bottle of his special gene.
“Well I can’t wait to show it to the guys!”  Said Washu as he ran out of the 
door to get Tenchi and the gang.  Henrii sat there looking at his potion, he 
got up with his potion and scratched his butt from sitting to long on the 
floor.  As Washu opened the door she dragged Tenchi and Ryoko, Sasami, 
Ayeka, Mihoshi, and Ryo-Ohki followed behind them.
“Today I have found a way to freeze time!” said Washu
“That’s nice Washu, but you don’t have to hurt me,” said Tenchi.
“I will show you my invention!” said Washu.  She took her invention and 
aimed at Tenchi and fired it.  Tenchi stood there like a stone pillar.
“Hmm Washu, I think you made a freeze ray instead of freezing time,” said 
Henrii holding his potion.
“Oh no my Lord Tenchi!” said Ayeka.
“Tenchi, no!” said Ryoko.
“Opps, I will work on an anti-freezer right now,” said Washu.
“You better do it right now mom!” said Ryoko.
“What’s that Henrii,” asked Ayeka.
“Its Henrii’s lame invention you don’t want to be bother by it,” said Washu.
“Its not lame it’s a potion to make carrots grow faster and larger,” said 
Henrii
“Miya miya,” said Ryo-Ohki.
“Would you please give me one carrot Ryo-Ohki,” said Henrii
“Miya miya!” said Ryo-Ohki as Ryo-Ohki ran to the door and came back with a 
carrot in her mouth.
“That was fast,” said Henrii as he took the carrot and pet Ryo-Ohki on her 
head.  Henrii typed a few commands on the computer and a huge needle pop out 
from the portal.  He inserted the needle into his potion sucked up some his 
special gene and inserted the needle into the carrot.  The carrot suddenly 
shake and grew about five feet larger from its normal size.
“When Tenchi is back to normal tell him to insert this to the roots of the 
carrot patch and let it grow, ok,” said Henrii.
“That’s a better invention than Washu’s!” said Sasami.
“Yeah it is,” as he turn to see what was Washu’s reaction is, which was a 
humph and returned back to her work.
“Well I’m tried I’m going back to the living room to rest,” said Henrii.
“Yeah same here,” said Mihoshi.
“I better get go start lunch,” said Sasami.
“I will stay here with Tenchi,” said Ayeka.
“No, I will stay here with Tenchi!” said Ryoko.
“No way you probably scare his soul from his body because of your face,” 
said Ayeka.
“Why you little…”
“You guys better stop and both go upstairs because right now Tenchi can 
break in half,” said Washu.
“Come with me girls we can find something we can do something, for Tenchi’s 
sake,” said Henrii.
“Ok,” both Ayeka and Ryoko said.

NO NEED FOR BATHS
All of them left the lab except for Washu and Tenchi.
“I’m going to the Osen, tell me when Tenchi is unfrozen,” said Ryoko.
“Hey Ryoko!” said Henrii.
“What is it, I was about to leave,” said Ryoko.
“I just wanted to know what is the Osen is,” said Henrii.
“Its just some hot spring,” said Ryoko as she teleports to the Osen.
“For once Ryoko has a good idea, I’m going to the Osen too,” said Ayeka.
“Me too!” said Mihoshi.  They walked up to the door and went in.
“Hmm, why not,” said Henrii as he open the door.  He looked around inside, 
there was garden and waterfalls which made the place very nice.  He looked 
around again where is those girls I thought I saw them went in he thought.  
Must be when a guy opens the door they going to the men side or something.  
Henrii got undressed by punching some buttons on his watch and placed a 
towel around his waist and went into the hot spring.  This is a great place 
to relax he thought.  The door opened and Tenchi came in.
“I though you were in there,” said Tenchi
“Yeah,” said Henrii
“Where is the girls?”
“On the girls side I think.”
“Ok I thought they went out or something.” Said Henrii as Tenchi entered the 
hot spring.
“You know what I think I can make another Osen and even better one,” said 
Henrii
“Oh yeah, you think so,” said Tenchi.
“Yep, maybe later then when I have nothing to do.”
“Oh.”
“Hey Tenchi which girl do you like the most,” said Henrii staring at the 
waterfalls.
“Umm I don’t really want to answer that,” said Tenchi turning red.
“Awe come on we are alone there is no sign of the girls and don’t make me 
read your mind.”
“Ok I really like….” Just as Tenchi was about to say the name they were 
teleported to the girls side.
Ryoko and Ayeka were talking about who might would be better for Tenchi to 
marry as they were sitting in the hot spring.  As Mihoshi was cleaning 
herself up.  All of a sudden Tenchi and Henrii fell from middle of nowhere 
from the air and fell into the hot spring.
“AHHHHH!” cried Henrii.
“AHHHHHHHH!” said Tenchi as they crashed into the water.  As Henrii fell 
into the hot spring he lost this towel.  He saw his towel in the water and 
swam to it and placed it over his waist just in time before Ryoko grab him 
by the leg and brought him up to the surface.
“Nope this is not Tenchi better throw it back,” said Ryoko as she threw 
Henrii into the water.
“What was mean to our guest, Ryoko!” said Ayeka.
“So just sue me,” said Ryoko as she continues her search for Tenchi.  Henrii 
pops his head out of the water and Tenchi was right next to him.
“Oh there you are Tenchi!” said Ryoko as she ran over and hugged Tenchi with 
her naked body.  Tenchi nose started to bleed and Henrii stared at him.
“You are bleeding Tenchi!” said Henrii
“AHHH! Get away from Tenchi you exhibitionist!” cried out Ayeka.  She ran to 
Ryoko as fast as she can and pushed Tenchi away from Ryoko and Ryoko was 
able to grab Ayeka’s towel and pulled it off from her just before Ryoko 
collide into Henrii.  Ayeka turn around and found Tenchi looking up to her 
with his nose bleed even worse than before.
“AH! Tenchi!” said Ayeka as she tried to cover herself as much as she can.  
In the water Henrii grabbed Ryoko and pulled her up to the surface.
“I can get up myself Henrii, ” said Ryoko.  And pushed Henrii across the 
Osen were Mihoshi was.  Henrii accidentally pulled off Mihoshi’s towel when 
he collided into Mihoshi.
“Oh no!” said Mihoshi.  Henrii saw Mihoshi and quickly gave Mihoshi her 
towel back.  Henrii thought to himself if the Commissioner finds out what I 
accidentally done my head will be hung on the wall.
“I’m so sorry Mihoshi, please forgive me,” said Henrii.
“That’s ok!” said Mihoshi placing her towel back on.

NO NEED FOR SCIENCE
In Washu’s lab she was having a ball of fun.  She watched the whole thing on 
her computer.
Oh Henrii you are so careless,  haha said Washu.  Oh nice body, Henrii even 
better than Tenchi’s, hehe.  What am I saying! What a weak and pathetic body 
you have Henrii, hahahaha.  Let me see what’s Ryoko and Ayeka are doing.  
Nah I should just return Henrii and Tenchi back.  Just when Ryoko and Ayeka 
was to hug Tenchi, Henrii and Tenchi disappeared back to the men side.  
Ryoko and Ayeka collided and fell into the water.  Tenchi and Henrii return 
back where they were Tenchi got out of the water and said to Henrii
“What happened! First we were here and we ended up at the girls side and 
came right back,” said Tenchi
“Yeah there must be something wrong in here,” said Henrii as he looked 
around.
“Lets get out of there I think we spent a lot of time in the Osen for 
today.”
“Yeah you are right,” said Henrii as he got up and got dressed.
As Tenchi opened the door and Henrii left closed the door.  Then they heard 
Sasami said
“Its time for lunch!” said Sasami.  The door opened open behind Henrii and 
Ryoko, Ayeka, and Mihoshi came out.  Henrii turned around and said,
“Lunch is ready girls,” said Henrii.
“Oh ok,” said Ayeka softly.
“Boy I’m starving,” said Mihoshi.
“Who is going to get Washu?” said Sasami.
“I will get Washu,” said Henrii.
“Thanks Henrii!” smiled Sasami.
Henrii opened Washu’s door and entered it.  The door opened and Washu’s door 
chime.  She quickly turned around and saw Henrii peeking through the crack 
on the door.
“Oh its you,” said Washu.
“Yep its me,” said Henrii as he opened the door all the way.
“What do you want Henrii.”
“Just to say that lunch is ready.”
“I will be there after I finish up something.”
“Ok we will wait for you little Washu,” as Henrii smiled and left her lab.
“Alright I’m done here!  Where are you Henrii?” said Washu.
Washu exited out her lab and started to go to the dinning room where 
everyone was laughing and having fun.
“Hey Washu finally decided to join us,” said Henrii.
“Yeah,” said Washu as she sat next to Henrii.
“Well I’m full, thank you for that wonderful food Sasami,” said Henrii
“Your welcome Henrii,” smiled Sasami.
“Same here too,” said Tenchi.
“Yeah,” said Ryoko as she grab Tenchi’s arm
“Err I better get back to the carrot fields,” said Tenchi.
“Oh wait, Tenchi don’t forget this,” said Henrii as he pulled out the 
computer Washu gave him and typed in some commands and Henrii’s potion and a 
needle came out.”
“What is it?” asked Tenchi.
“Just insert this needle into this potion and inject this potion into the 
roots and the carrots would be bigger and taste a lot better.
“Ok thanks,” said Tenchi as he took the potion and needle and dragged Ryoko 
out to the door.
“What time is it!” said Mihoshi.
“It is 3:30 right now,” said Henrii looking at his watch.
“Oh no! My favorite show is on, I hope I’m not late!” said Mihoshi as she 
ran out of the dinning room an turned on the TV.
“Well I better go to my crashed plane to do something,” said Henrii as he 
got up and went outside.
“Washu are you going to eat something?” said Sasami.
“Eat what?” as Washu placed her hand on her cheeks.
“What are you looking at Washu?” said Sasami.
“Oh, I’m just thinking about an invention that it,” said Washu.
“Honestly Washu you have a crush on Henrii,” said Ayeka.
“Umm I think that Ryoko is about to kiss Tenchi, quickly Ayeka before she 
kiss Tenchi on the lips!” cried out Washu.
“My Tenchi!” said Ayeka as she ran out of the house to the carrot fields.
“That always get..h,” said Washu when she looked at Sasami
“Do you like Henrii?” asked Sasami holding her hand together.
“No I don’t like Henrii at all.  He is not my type anyway,” said Washu
“Hey I’m back!” said Henrii smiling at the girls
“What did you got?” asked Sasami
“Nothing just checking on my craft,” said Henrii
“Miya miya miya,” said Ryo-Ohki on Sasami’s lap.
“Oh ok,” as Sasami left the dinning room and went to watch TV with Mihoshi 
and Ryo-Ohki followed behind her.
Washu was typing up something on her computer and Henrii went and looked 
over Washu’s shoulders.
“Hmm I think that EMG12  should go that way because if you keep it were it 
is it would cause a great explosion,” said Henrii.
“I know what I’m doing Henrii,” said Washu as she stared at Henrii’s dark 
eyes.  After a few arguments Henrii sat right next to Washu and placed his 
hands over her hands.   Washu’s mind was filled with thoughts.  Oh my, he is 
sitting next to me and he placed his strong soft hands on mine hands!  
Better not do something stupid so I can make him mine.  Henrii’s mind was 
filled with thoughts.  If she could only understand that if she placed this 
EMPOS 23P here and there and adds MKS 2NMS there.  Her time freezer would 
work like a charm.
“Uhh whats a doing with my fingers Henrii?” asked Washu.
“Well I’m going to guide you though this,” said Henrii.
“Ok hehehe,”
“Done just push enter and you are done,” said Henrii with a smile.
“Thanks Henrii,” as she looked into Henrii’s eyes and he also look at her 
green eyes.  They started to move closer and closer and Washu closed her 
eyes.  Tenchi opened the door and asked for help.
“Henrii are you there, can you help me?” said Tenchi.
“Yeah sure,” as he got up from where he was sitting with Washu and went to 
help Tenchi with the carrot load.  Washu was moving closer into a deep angle 
with her eyes closed and fell on her face.  Where did Henrii go? She thought 
as she looked over and found Henrii carrying huge carrots over his back and 
same with Tenchi.  Damn it, I was so close to kissing him.  As she got up 
and watch Henrii and Tenchi but away the huge carrots.
“With the carrots with this size I don’t even think Ryo-Ohki would ever 
finish it all in one dinner,” said Tenchi.
“Did you use all of the potion or use a little?” questioned Henrii
“Umm I think all of it,” said Tenchi.
“Good,” said Henrii as they bring in the carrots to the storage.  Ryo-Ohki 
turned her head around and saw Tenchi carrying a huge carrot.
“Miya!” said Ryo-Ohki as she jumped onto the carrot and started to eat.
“Hey Henrii something is wrong my the carrots on my back are getting 
lighter,” said Tenchi.  Henrii look behind Tenchi’s back and saw Ryo-Ohki 
eating her way to the top of the carrot.  Wow he thought this little 
creature can eat twice its size.  As he place Ryo-Ohki in the storage with 
the carrots.
“Hey Henrii what time is it?” said Tenchi putting down the carrots.
“Well its 6:00 right now,” said Henrii.
“Oh man I better get to the shine fast!” said Tenchi
“Can I come Tenchi,” said Henrii as he placed down the last carrots near 
Ryo-Ohki.
“Sure,” said Tenchi as he closed the storage room where Ryo-Ohki was in and 
locked it.
“Miya?” said Ryo-Ohki in the storage room and continued to eat the carrot.
