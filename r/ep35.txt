CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Boku wa moto Pioneer" by Chisa Yokoyama(with much the same look as
OVA2 opening but including Kiyone, Seion, Demi, The Knights, Nagi, Misaki, Megumi and all those
adorable little cabbits.
SCENE: The Masaki House. Halloweenish. The carnival is today also.(Granpa thought it was a good
idea to have it on Halloween so a couple of other guest could come and not have anybody give
them strange looks.) Tenchi is sitting on the couch dressed in Shinji's plugsuit from
Evangelion. Kiyone walks in dressed in a kimono with a printing depicting a scene from "The
Demon of Roshamon" on it.
TENCHI: Wow, Kiyone! Where did you get that?
KIYONE: Well, your father got the kimono, but Megumi painted the scene on it. Talented, isn't
she?
TENCHI: I'll say.
RYOKO: (off screen) Tenchi!
AEKA: (off screen) We're ready now!(just then Aeka and Ryoko enter dressed as Rei and Aska
respectivly)
KIYONE: See you at the carnival!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 35: NO NEED FOR ANOTHER CARNIVAL!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The carnival. People are starting to arrive. We see Noboyuki dressed as Gendo Ikari
Getting his Video Kareoke booth ready. Big Washu, dressed as Cutey Honey (OVA) and Asaka,
done up like Heihachi from Tekken 3, are getting their VR Arcade ready. Meanwhile, at Sammy,
Misa and Tsun's Kawaii candy shop, We see Pretty Sammy, Pixy Misa, and Tsunami behind the
counter getting their candy out for sale. And at Megumi's Portrait's and Things we hear.....
MEGUMI:(off screen) Come on! You look fine!
KAMADAKE:(off screen) But it's just not me!
MEGUMI: Quit crying and get out here!(She pulls him on screen where we see them dressed as
Tifa and Cloud from FF7)
KAMADAKE: Well, the sword isn't too bad, but the hair...It looks like Washu did it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Tenchi and his admirers walk up to a paticular booth that says "The Great Makibi"
Tenchi knocks to see if anyone is in. Mihoshi opens the curtains dressed in a skimpy white
tiger-striped outfit. 
MIHOSHI: Oh, it's you Tenchi! How are you doing?
TENCHI: Just fine. When does the show start? 
MIHOSHI: In two hours. Seion's giving us an hour to enjoy the carnival and to pass out flyers
to it. (Just then, Nagi and Demi walk out dressed in the same costume that Mihoshi is wearing.)
NAGI: I can't believe I agreed to this!
DEMI: C'mon! You look great! You might even get lucky tonight!
NAGI: Well, this outfit does show off my body quite well. (they leave. Just then Seion pops his
head out)
AEKA: There you are! How dare you have those poor girls dress in those outfits!
RYOKO: Where can I get one?
TENCHI: What tricks do you have planned?
SEION: To answer all your inquiries, I'm wearing a lot less for this show, I got the outfits
from some white-haired gal named Urd, And if I told you, I'd have to kill you!(he comes out
in a  tuxedo with a white tiger skin tied around his neck like a cape.)See you at the show.
(He and Mihoshi walk off.)
TENCHI: Uh, okay........(in the backround we hear a young couple arguing...)
GIRL: Stop looking at them, you pervert!
GUY: You are so uncute!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Candy Shop. Sasami is serving a cute couple,
SASAMI: Here you go! A bag of peanut-brittle!
MAN: Thank you.(He hands her money) Here you go, Bell.
WOMAN: Thank you, Keiichi.(They leave)
SASAMI: BYE! HAVE FUN!(Just then Tenchi and the girls walk up) Tenchi! Welcome! What'll you 
have? We got LOTS of different candies that I made! So take your pick!
TENCHI: Thanks Sasami. I will.(Tenchi then just stares at the counter, indecisive about what 
to choose.)
RYOKO: Uh, Tenchi, it's not a major decision here....
AEKA: Yes. Why can't you be a little more like...like...(Just then Seion and Mihoshi walk up)
SEION: A bag of your pink lemonade candy, my little azure-haired goddess.
SASAMI: Here you go, Seion-san!(hands him his bag)
MIHOSHI: And here's your money!
SASAMI: BYE! HAVE FUN! (Seion and Mihoshi leave)
AEKA: Like that.
RYOKO: (Looks at a stop watch) It took him all of 1.45 seconds to make a decision!
TENCHI: Uh.....We'll have chocolate covered cherries.
SASAMI: Here you go, Tenchi!
AEKA: And here's your money, Sasami.
SASAMI: BYE! HAVE FUN!(Tenchi and his hangers-on leave) MISAO! It's your turn to serve the 
customers!
MISAO: Alright....(As she steps to the counter, Troz the cyclops walks up) Umm, how.....may 
I...help you...Sir?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Meanwhile at Noboyuki's Video Kareoke, a familiar looking woman is singing a song we all
 know as "Konya Hurricane" while her date, obviously a cop, looks on. There is a large crowd of 
other anime characters watching and waiting for their number to come up. Among them are two 
female traffic cops, two lovely ladies who are pilots in the JSDF, a cute girl with an 
oversized spatula on her back and her date, a guy who's holding on to her hand so he doesn't 
get lost AGAIN, and a gaggle of girls all dressed in colorful sailor suits with some gut 
dressed in a tuxedo and a mask. Across from Noboyuki's booth, Kiyone's Flower stand has a 
customer, a young man and his soulmate (okay, so it's Makoto and Ifurita) 
KIYONE: Here you are, sir. One dozen roses.
MAKOTO: Thank you.(He hands her the money for them, and presents the flowers to his love. 
Nothing is said between them. Nothing needs to be. They walk away, already knowing how they 
feel about each other)
KIYONE:(crying) That's so sweet...(just then Aeka, Ryoko, and their boyfriend walk up)
RYOKO: Hey, boss! How's buisness?
KIYONE: I'm mainly getting the people as they leave.(Her watch goes off) It's my turn! Could 
you watch the booth for me until I get back?
AEKA: Yes, of course, Lady Kiyone.
KIYONE: Thank you. I'll be back in about 10 minutes.(Kiyone leaves)
TENCHI: Lady Kiyone?
AEKA: Well, she is marrying father.
RYOKO: That she is.
TENCHI: FATHER? Since when is he you two's father?
AEKA: (blushing) Well, we thought that if we all.....
RYOKO: You know. Me, Aeka, and you all got....
TENCHI: Uh......We'll just leave it at that.
(In the background we hear Kiyone singing "Chiisa Hana" and singing it quite WELL.)

SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)

=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: Ryoko and Ranma facing off against each other. Ranma charges at Ryoko. Ryoko splits 
into two Ryokos on either side of Ranma who procede to beat the crap outta him.
RYOGA: If your gonna get your ass kicked, get you ass kicked. But if you want the best 
Okinamiyoki in all of Japan, then there's only one place to go. U-chan's, have it your way.
UKYO: Oh, Ryoga honey!
RANMA: But I thought you liked me!
UKYO: What? You think you're the only guy in the universe? You don't treat any of us with any 
respect!
RYOGA: You can have Akane! I WANT UKYO!
GENMA: U-chan's. Now with 5 locations including the newest one in Okayama.
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: Washu's VR Wonderland! Asaka is being the tar out of anyone who wishes to play him, 
until along comes Tsunami. Acting on Sasami's knowledge of fighting games and using her 20k 
years of knowledge and her superior relfexes she trounces the bearded Jurian Knight in record 
time, humbling him greatly.
ASAKA: PLEASE GODDESS! GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE!
TSUNAMI: Later, my friend. I must be getting back so Sasami and Misao can go on their break. 
Farewell, my friend.(Tsunami leaves and heads for the Candy stand across from the arcade. 
Sasami and Misao enter the Arcade tent not long after.)
SASAMI:(cracking her knuckles) I'm ready, my student.
ASAKA: So, we meet again at last,(they start the game) When I last fought you I was but a 
learner. Now I am the master!
SASAMI: Only a master of losing, Asaka!
ASAKA: You powers are weak, little girl.
SASAMI: You can't win, Asaka. If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can 
possibly imagine.
WASHU: KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE KENOBI-VADER ROUTINE!
ASAKA&SASAMI: Sorry.
MISAO: SASAMI! IT'S TIME!
SASAMI: Oh no! The Magic show!(Sasami quickly deals with Asaka and then hurries her kawaii 
little rear-end to the Magic show.)
ASAKA: I lost again.....
WASHU: Come on. Let's go to the Magic Show.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Magic show. Washu, Asaka, Kamadake, Megumi, Misao, Sasami, Aeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, 
Kiyone, Noboyuki, and Yosho are all in the first row.
AEKA: Sasami, have you seen Mother? (Sasami gives her onee-chan a disapproving look.) 
I'm not going to......(sigh)...Have you seen our Mommy?
SASAMI: No. But Mommy said she'd be here.
RYOKO: Quiet down! It's starting!(And with that an elaborate laser-light show, done by 
Washu, starts up. Out comes Nagi, Demi, and Mihoshi in their outfits. Then Seion appears 
in a burst of flame, dressed in just a tiger-skin loincloth. The show now begins. He does 
various tricks such as cutting Nagi in half, throwing knives at Mihoshi blindfolded <Seion's 
blindfolded, not Mihoshi> Pulling a three cabbits out of a hat, pulling a hat out of a cabbit 
<Tetin was hungry> levitating Demi and now for his final act......Turning a tiger into a 
pretty young lady. As Seion finishes the trick, he helps the lady out of the box and 
its....)
AEKA: MOMMY?!(Misaki is wearing an elegant White tiger striped dress. White tiger stripes is 
a Seion thing.)
SASAMI: OH BOY! HORRAY FOR MOMMY!!
SEION: Hey, I did do the trick you know!
MISAO: Wonderful Trick, Mrs. Jurai!
RYOKO: Way to go, Queen!
MEGUMI: SUGOI, pretty young lady!
SEION: Hey now! I did have something to do with it!
YOSHO! You'll have to tell me how you did that, Misaki.
ASAKA: You performed well, my lady.(All but Kiyone, Noboyuki, and Seion's assistants leave 
congradulating Misaki all the while.)
SEION: This sucks! I did all that work and she gets all the credit for just stepping out 
of the box at the end.!
KIYONE: You were great.
SEION: Thanks Kiyo.
KIYONE: Not you! Noboyuki got the whole thing on tape!
NOBOYUKI: I'm gonna edit it later and show it later.(They leave, leaving only Seion and 
Mihoshi)
MIHOSHI: If it makes you feel better, I thought you were great!(She kisses him)
SEION:(in a stupid-voice)Huh-huh! Feeling good all over!(as he leans over to kiss her, it 
starts to rain) Uh-oh! CLOSING TIME! GET INSIDE!(Ever one starts closing up to protect 
their wares. As Washu closes the door to her tent, the tent disappears. Sasami and Misao 
hurry to close their stand. Noboyuki packs the rest of his equipment away and puts it in 
the storage box he has for it. Megumi leave her things in Yosho's place. Kiyone seem not 
to worried about the rain getting her things rained upon for they are flowers and the rain 
only makes them better. Kiyone breaks out her umbrella and decends the staircase with 
Noboyuki. Everyone rushes past them.)
NOBOYUKI: Isn't our little family great?
KIYONE:(smiles) Yes, though they are a bit ecentric.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Ladies bath. The girls, feeling sorry for the menfolk, allowed them the 
honor of going into the bath to keep them from freezing. You should already know who's 
sitting next to who (and if you don't, you ain't been reading.)
AEKA: Are you alright, Tenchi?
TENCHI: Just fine. How about you two?
RYOKO: We're okay. Those plastic suits kept the rain off. I got to get more of those!
AEKA: Agreed.
MISAKI: I'm glad to see that you're all okay. Are you speaking to me yet, Seion?
SEION: You could've said something.
MISAKI: Well, I am sorry.
SEION: I guess I can accept that, my Kawaii one. But please, no hugging.
MISAKI: Righto, Little Seion.(Sasami and Tsunami enter with hot chocolate!)
SASAMI: Here you all go! Fresh and hot!
TSUNAMI: Drink up!
AEKA: We should go again tomorrow! It'll be so much fun!
KIYONE: Fun nothing! You're working at the booth tomorrow!
RYOKO: Both of us?
KIYONE: That's right!
TENCHI: Well, I come by and see you tomorrow!
NOBOYUKI: Not likely. You're running the stand tomorrow.
TENCHI: Do I have to?
SASAMI: Alright! I'll come by and do a song with you, Tenchi!
MISAKI: It'll be so much fun!
(As the ending music starts we hear the cast laughing in the background.)
