Ryoko's Son
Chapter 1 "Hello Rychi!"
By: Rebel Princess




     "Mr. Masaki... Mr. Masaki??? RYCHI MASAKI ARE U PAYING ANY
     ATTENTION?" Mr. Smith, the History teacher yelled. Rychi or Ry as
     everyone called him, snapped his head away from the window and
     stared at Mr. Smith, who was turning a very nice shade of purple.
     "Yes Mr. Smith? we're you saying something?" Ry asked innocently.
     "MR. MASAKI! JUST BECAUSE U ARE AN EXCHANGE STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN
     THAT U GET SPECIAL TREATMENT, DO U UN....!"
     "Yes Mr. Smith, I understand perfectly, now can u please repeat
     what u were saying," Ry asked again, getting a little annoyed at
     the teacher. During this whole conversation, snickers and soft
     giggles were heard all throughout the class, who couldn't believe
     that Ry would dare defy Mr. Smith or as they called him "The
     Bloodrinker".
     "Ahem, yes.. now *sneers* Would you by any chance know what the
     Civil War was here in America??? hmmm?" The Bloodrinker asked
     smugly knowing that Ry wouldn't know.... was he wrong...
     "The Civil War also known as North vs. South, Blue vs. Gray, was
     fought from 1861 to 1865, for many reasons, but it mostly
     consisted of slavery, the North was against it, whereas the South
     was for it, the battle's ranged from roughly all over the U.S.,
     but mostly in the south..." Ry told him matter of factly and to
     the point, The bloodrinker and the whole class face faulted.
     Looking around Ry noticed that Alexia Vine, the daughter of the
     people that he was staying with and his friend gave him a small
     smile and a thumbs up. Ry smiled back and returned the thumbs up,
     Ry turned back around and couldn't wait till class was over so he
     could talk to Alexia and walk home with her.
     *RIIIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!*
     Finally! Thank you God! Ry thought as he grabbed his books and got
     out of that class room as fast as he could, not wanting to have
     the Bloodrinker stop and talk with him. he grabbed his stuff out
     of his locker and decided to wait by Alexia's locker.
     **************************************************************

     Alexia chuckled when she saw Ry run out of the room, it wasn't
     hard to spot him in the crowd of students waiting to get out of
     the door, his spiky, cyan hair made him stick out in a crowd, not
     including his catlike eyes which were the color of melted gold.
     "Hey Lexie!" a voice said behind her. Alexia turned and saw her
     friend Meg come running toward her.
     "Hey Meg"
     "Did Ry really outsmart the Bloodrinker?" Meg burst out when she
     reached her, Alexia looked stunned.
     "How did u know?" Alexia asked, she was very confused.
     "Alexia are u serious? You know how fast news travels here! Any
     ways let's go Ry waiting for you." Meg told her pointing at a very
     impatient Ry.
     "um oh ok, " Alexia said running toward him.
     ************************************************************

     Ry saw Alexia and her friend come running over, Alexia, with her
     blonde hair and deep tan looks alot like Mihoshi, except with
     green eyes instead of blue, oh and she's alot smarter, Ry thought
     to himself as she came running toward him.
     "Sorry........I'm.......late......" Alexia panted.
     "oh it's okay, i just waited here patiently.." Alexia gave him a
     look "...okay well maybe not patiently, but anyways are you
     ready?" Ry asked grabbing his bookbag and hers.
     "Ya, I'm ready, will u give me that!" Alexia Said jumping up and
     trying to grab her bookbag, which she was at a disadvantage being
     only 5'2'' and he was 6'2" (Thanks to a little experiment Washu
     did which didn't make him short like his mother and father).
     "Uh-uh, nope i'm carrying it, *chuckles* i need to work out " Ry
     said holding it out of her reach.
     "No you don't! your muscles are almost bigger than my head!"
     Alexia giggled. of course you couldn't tell because Ry would
     always wear big shirts, probably to make people think he was
     weaker then he was, Ry always likes to get in fights, (heehee
     almost like his mother) Ry put his arm around Alexia's shoulder
     and walked out of the front of the school, Ry liked Alexia, she
     always got him to laugh, which he hadn't done since he left Japan
     for the exchange student program, sure he missed everyone,
     especially his mother and father and his grandmother, but Alexia
     was someone special, Ry laughed softly when he thought about his
     mother. *sheesh* I'm just like my mother! i'd do anything for
     Lexie, now i know how she feels about dad*
     "Hey Ry, What are you thinking about?" Alexia asked looking up at
     him.
     "Oh, nothing, just my Mom and Dad," Ry told her.
     "Oh, ok, hey Ry...."
     "YO RYCHOW OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS, GET YOUR ARM OFF OF MY GIRL!"
     an angry voice said from behind them.
     Ry turned and saw Mitch Summers, captain of everything, and king
     of the jocks and jerks come striding from them.
     "Geeezzz! not him!" Ry growled.
     "Mitch i am not your girl and i will never be your girl, get that
     through your thick head!" Alexia shouted at him.
     "YEAH ALEXIA, YOUR JUST SAYING THAT.....BUT IM GONNA MAKE YOU
     CHANGE YOUR MIND!" Mitch said walking towards them.
     "Alexia go and stand over there, there might be a fight and I
     don't want you to get hit," Ry told her as he counted how many he
     had to fight. *hmmm, 11, mitch and 10 goons, not biggie* Ry said
     to himself, a crowd stated to form and everyone was cheering on
     mitch, (because like i said before they thought Ry was weak) Ry
     grinned and took off his sweatshirt, so he'd be able to swing his
     arms freely, and he laughed when he saw Mitch's and his goon's
     jaws drop and a big gasp from the crowd, because they could all
     see Ry's muscles though his tight shirt, and they were big.
     "forget Mitch! I'm going with Ry!" someone shouted.
     " ALRIGHT RY! YOUR GOING DOWN!"Mitch shouted as he swung at Ry,
     who easily avoided it, and punched mitch in the stomach. Steaming
     with rage Mitch ran at Ry, who stepped aside and as Mitch ran past
     Ry kicked him which sent him flying...into a pile of mud! Everyone
     in the crowd burst out laughing and started calling Mitch "mud
     sucker". Ry  shook his head and walked over and picked up his and
     Alexia's book bags and ran over to her.
     "Sorry about that, let's go home," he said as he put his arm
     around her shoulder and they started back to the Vine's home, what
     Ry didn't expect was the surprise that was waiting there for
     him....
