Disclaimer:
Pioneer and some other people own Tenchi, I do not. I merely like to read and write new
series. If someone tries to sue me then I hope that they don't choose an expensive
lawyer because they would only get $13.43, some gum and a bottlecap. Now that
that's over with I would like to say that this story is rated 13 and up because I have
bought some of the episodes and all of them are rated that way. Now to the
Prolouge!!!  
 
 
This is a continuation of the Tenchi Muyo Series because that one is my favorite!
 
In the beginning of time there were three goddess's-  
Tokimi- The Goddess of Truth
Washu- The Goddess of Wisdom
Tsunami- The Goddess of Love
 They all lived in harmony but as time passed Washu and Tsunami became sad. Washu
was sad because she could not journey to other worlds and learn from others. Tsunami
was sad because she had no way to spread her love and joy. To solve this problem
Washu decided to become a human and get to try and find all the secrets of the known
universe on her own. Tsunami on the other hand had a different approach to her
solution. She became the first Jurai life tree and from her many others came. Tsunami,
though had manely became a life tree so that Washu would find a way to travel the
stars and create spaceships so that people who weren't from Jurai could travel the
stars.
 
With no other Goddess's left Tokimi ruled the entire universe and that power corupted
her. She became evil and if tsunami did not still exist and protect people with her love
then she would have spread darkness and evil on the universe. Yet sadly sometimes she
failed in her mission. Tokimi told Kagato of the power that he could have if he would
capture Washu and control her daughter. Kagato's fulfilled Tokimi's wishes and then he
launched an attack against Tsunami hoping to succeed in Tokimi's new deed. He failed
her and Ryoko was imprisoned by Yosho on Earth  . He continued to to terrorize the
universe until he sensed Ryoko's presense and captured her. Then Tenchi,  Ayeka,
Mihoshi and Sasami were caught up in a giant battle and in the end killed Kagato and
rescued Ryoko and Washu her mother.
After an encounter with, Dr. clay Tokimi became worried because she sensed the power
from Ryoko and Ayeka, but she was scared to death of Tenchi's power most of all
because he possessed powers that were great enough to destroy almost anthing that
she threw at him. After a while Mihoshi's partner Keonay was reassigned to the solar
system and they got to know her pretty good. Then Tokimi reawakened KAIN and sent
him into the past, but she did not predict that they would be able to go back in time, or
that Tenchi's mom would be able to wield the power that would destroy KAIN.
Keonay was promoted back to HQ but Mihoshi stayed with Tenchi and co. and that is
where this story will take off from!!!

____________________________________________________________________________
 
Tenchi: Tenchi is kind and caring but when confronted he could fight to the death. He
seems to know how to deal with alien girls really good. He doesn't know who he loves
the most but he might find out in the story. He holds the power of being able to
generate three light hawk wings and is very good at sword fighting.
 
Ayeka: Ayeka has a good side and a bad side. She can be a kind and gentle loving
person, or she can be prude and selfish. She is very strong and has never yet shown
her true power. She and Ryoko have equal power but it depends on what they are
fighting about. Ayeka was scarred when Yosho left her and it left her not wanting to
open up to anyone , but Tenchi penetrated that wall and Ayeka is able to sometimes
show how she feels.
 
Ryoko: Ryoko also has two different sides. She can be sweet and happy, but she can
also act rude and mean. Ryoko loves Tenchi, and she has no problem showing it but
there is a side of her that she hides which ussualy is her emotional side. She and Ayeka
are both as strong as each other all though Ryoko uses her powers more often. When
she was enslaved by Kagato she was forced to do many horrible things, some that still
haunt her.
 
Sasami: Sasami is the kindest and sweetest person that anyone has ever met, which is
why Tsunami saved her life by assimalating her. She can also do just about any
household chore and make itseem fun. Beneath her happiness there is the fact that she
is really just going to disappear and become Tsunami.
 
Mihoshi: Mihoshi is a very kind person although she can be slightly forgetful and clumsy.
When she is on patrol she seems to become a completely different person and gets her
job done. She tends to be just another dumb blond but she can be very serious and
determined.
 
Washu: Washu is the smartest person in the universe and she likes others to know it.
She has the knowledge to create another galaxy or destroy the whole universe. She
likes to experiment on Tenchi, although it is usually against his will. Washu used to be
married but her husband left her and took their child. This hurt Washu, but creating
Ryoko gave her a new joy in life and she carried on.
 
Nobuyuki: Nobuyuki is Tenchi's dad. He is ussually working on house designs, but he
loves Tenchi a lot. He might be a bit perverted but usualy it's best to try and ignore
that fact about him.
 
Yosho: Yosho is Tenchi's grandfather and surprisingly Ayeka's half brother and
ex-fiance. He feels bad about deserting her, but thinks that she got over it. He is half
Jurian but is also half earthling.
 
Keonay: Keonay is Mihoshi's old partner and best friend. Keonay often got fed up with
Mihoshi, but she truly loves her like a little sister. Keonay may be mean and seem
uptight but she still likes to do things like sing kareoke. 
 
That is all you need to know, see you later for Chapter 1
