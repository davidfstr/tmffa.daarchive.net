What do you need, Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Sasami wishes you to join us for dinner tonight.

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm, good.  What is the special occasion?

Mihoshi covers her mouth and laughs.

MIHOSHI
I think she wants us all to die together.

GRANDFATHER
What?!

MIHOSHI
I'm just joking, Grandfather.  Ayeka and Ryoko are cooking tonight.

GRANDFATHER
Oh, I forgot.  I do have many pressing matters to attend to.

MIHOSHI
You will make Sasami cry if you don't show up Grandfather.

A look of resignation crosses Grandfather's face.

The Shrimp Fried Rice.

RYOKO
The Tempura.

TENCHI (Expressed as a thought)
Well things are back to normal.

Ayeka and Ryoko glare lighting at each other.

They do a quick game of rock, paper, and scissors behind Tenchi's back.

Ayeka wins rock to scissors.

Ryoko pouts and looks down.

AYEKA
Please try the Shrimp Fried Rice, Lord Tenchi.

TENCHI
I am quite able to feed myself, Ayeka.

AYEKA
But your food is in my chopsticks.  I won't be able to eat unless you 
take it.  Please.

Tenchi takes the food and sees that Ayeka does start eating.

Tenchi swallows and Ryoko holds the Tempura in front of him.

RYOKO
Now try the Tempura, Tenchi.

Tenchi rolls his eyes and takes the food.

Ayeka and Ryoko alternate feeding Tenchi for the rest of the meal.

Washu watches the exchange with interest.

After everyone finishes eating.

GRANDFATHER
Another excellent meal Sasami.

FATHER
Yes, Sasami, I am so happy to have you cooking for us.

TENCHI and WASHU
Thank you, Sasami.

Sasami and Mihoshi both giggle into their hands.

A mischievous look crosses Sasami's face.

SASAMI
Which did you like better, Tenchi, the Shrimp Fried Rice or the Tempura?

TENCHI
How can I answer that, Sasami?  Both were excellent.  I think this is 
the first time you served them together.

Both Ayeka and Ryoko have beaming smiles.

SASAMI
You're still silly Tenchi.  Ayeka made the Shrimp Fried Rice, and Ryoko 
made the Tempura.

Tenchi looks stunned.

Ayeka and Ryoko glow.

Ryoko then looks down and stops smiling.

RYOKO
Well Sasami had everything ready.  I just dropped the pieces in the 
batter and then in the fryer.

Ryoko's face takes on a serious look.

RYOKO
Remembering to take them out, now that was difficult.

Ayeka also stops smiling and looks down.

AYEKA
Well Sasami had everything mixed up for me.  I just had to drop it in 
the wok and stir it around.

Tenchi places his arms around both of them.

TENCHI
You both did wonderfully.  Sasami left the hardest part for each of you.

Both girls smile and melt into Tenchi.

Chorus of thank you to Ryoko and Ayeka from everyone except Washu.

Washu looks lost in thought.

TENCHI
What's wrong, Little Washu?

WASHU
I don't like it when my guinea pig keeps surprising me!

Everyone laughs.

As the meal breaks up Mihoshi and Sasami start clearing the dishes.

RYOKO
Father can you take Ayeka and me to town tomorrow?

Ayeka steps into the scene.

AYEKA
Ah ha, I thought I would find you sneaking around here.

Find me!  I found you trying to sneak in Tenchi's room.

AYEKA
I am doing no such thing.  I only wish to say good night to Lord Tenchi.

RYOKO
Yeah, right.

Ryoko starts making a kissy face.

AYEKA
What is that suppose to mean?

RYOKO
You are here to kiss Tenchi good night, right.

AYEKA
You hussy.  I am not going to throw myself at any man.

RYOKO
Well I'm here to kiss Tenchi good night.

AYEKA
No you are not!

Ryoko and Ayeka glare lightning at each other and raise a fist.  Ryoko 
wins paper to rock.

Ayeka sniffs in defeat and both move in front of Tenchi's door.  Ryoko 
knocks on the door.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Who is it?

RYOKO
We need to talk to you Tenchi.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Now what?

The door opens with Tenchi, in his pajamas, standing in it.

We know that, Tenchi.

WASHU
How can you...

Washu looks at Ayeka with a puzzled frown.

Is that old law still on the books?

AYEKA
No one saw any reason to take it off.

SASAMI
Stop being silly Tenchi.  Who do you think has been making breakfast 
for Father all summer?

TENCHI
Oh, I'm sorry Sasami.  I didn't know.

FATHER
Sasami's breakfast is a wonder Tenchi.  I always leave for work full of 
energy.  I haven't told anyone yet but they are going to assign a major 
Tokyo project to me next month.

SASAMI
That is great news Father!

TENCHI
Wow, dad.  Is that like a promotion?

FATHER
It sure is.  It will mean a big raise too.  And just in time.  I am 
sorry to say it, but you girls are very expensive.

SASAMI
I'm sorry to be a burden, Father.

FATHER
I didn't mean that Sasami.  You girls are never a burden, you are a 
joy to an old mans heart.

The men sit down to eat.

TENCHI
I am looking forward to school, dad.  It will give me a chance to get 
away from it all.

Sasami drops a bowl.

SASAMI
Oh my.  I'm sorry.

TENCHI
Why?

AYEKA
We did it Friday when Father took us to town.

RYOKO
We enrolled in your school as exchange students.

AYEKA
Father did not know what we did.

RYOKO
He thought we went shopping for you.

TENCHI
I will ask again, why?

AYEKA
We wanted to... to...

Ayeka breaks down in tears.

RYOKO
To protect you from the other girls in school.

Tenchi's face grows angry.

RYOKO
That was not the main reason for us enrolling!

AYEKA
I...  We wanted to... to...

RYOKO
To learn your Earth ways so we could make you better wives.

Tenchi hugs both girls.

TENCHI
And the truth will set you free.  You must know now that I love you 
both totally. It would be far easier for me to fall on my sword then 
to betray either of you.

AYEKA
I still want to go to school with you Lord Tenchi.  We did it before 
for your Mother.  I know what it involves now.  Please let us go with 
you Lord Tenchi!

RYOKO
We will make every effort to behave Tenchi.  I will not fly, or go 
through walls, or blow anything up.  Only one thing Tenchi.  If anyone 
tries to harm you.  I don't mean anything minor but something serious.  
Then there are no rules but one, and that is to win.

TENCHI
The bus is coming, Ayeka.  Pull yourself together, please.  We will see 
if the exchange students will be here all year or not later.

Ayeka cleans her face as the bus pulls up.

physics in third, government in sixth, and business applications in 
seventh.  You two took contemporary literature?

RYOKO
I am up on all the latest comics.

AYEKA
And I have kept track of the popular soap operas.

TENCHI
Ah, yeah.  Well I am taking calligraphy in second period.  Sasami will 
be happy to find out you are taking home and family development.

AYEKA
I don't think we did to well with Taro.

RYOKO
And I want to show mom that I can be a better mother than she can.

TENCHI
I think it's great.  I am taking kendo in fourth period.  You two are 
taking team sports in fifth I see.  You know, both of you are a little 
stronger and faster than the average earthling.

Ryoko takes on a sweet expression.

RYOKO
I know when to hold back Tenchi.

Ayeka takes on a determined look.

AYEKA
Just don't you think we will lose on purpose.

TENCHI
I just don't want anyone hurt, and I don't want you to forget and use 
your powers in the heat of competition.

AYEKA and RYOKO
Yes, Tenchi.

TENCHI
We will see how it goes.  It may even be fun.  Don't hesitate to come

Only Kagato and Washu have given me any training.

TENCHI

My teacher, Ms. Washu, had me studying quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics?

Mr. Ikuko opens his desk and pulls out a different exam.

Please take this back to your seat and complete it.  Bring it back to 
me when you are done.

Ryoko returns to her desk and sits down.

Tenchi gives her a questioning look.

Ryoko shrugs her shoulders and starts to work.

Clock moves forward 15 minutes.

All the other students are still working.  Ryoko stands up and goes to 
Mr. Ikuko's desk.  

Mr. Ikuko examines the paper.

IKUKO
Ms. Ryoko, you have gotten 100% on the end of year final exam.

Mr. Ikuko stands.

IKUKO
Would you please accompany me to the hallway?

Mr. Ikuko and Ryoko exit the classroom to the deserted hallway.

INT. Hallway - DAY

IKUKO
I'm afraid this course will not be very challenging to you Ms. Ryoko.

RYOKO
I'm sorry.  Please don't kick me out!  I can change some of my answers!

IKUKO
Please calm down Ms. Ryoko.  No one is going to kick you out for your 
knowledge.  I would like to know if you would assist me as class tutor.  
You can help those students who are not gifted like you.

RYOKO
Oh, wow.  Students like Tenchi?

IKUKO
Well yes, if he needed your help.

RYOKO
Can I hang out in the teacher's lounge?

Mr. Ikuko covers his mouth with a fist to cover his laughter.

IKUKO
We will have to discuss that later.  Will you take the job?

RYOKO
I will try Mr. Ikuko.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Mr. Ikuko and Ryoko enter the classroom, and Ryoko returns to her seat.

Ryoko pulls out one of Father's comics and reads.

IKUKO
Time everyone.  Please pass your papers to the front.  You will receive 
your scores tomorrow.  Everyone has early dismissal to your next class.

Ayeka and Tenchi gather around Ryoko.

TENCHI
What did Mr. Ikuko want?

RYOKO
He wants me to be an assistant teacher.

Ayeka and Tenchi looked shocked.

TENCHI
What?!

RYOKO
Well, I got all the answers right on that first test he gave me.  So 
he gave me another one called end of year exam.  I got all those answers 
right, too.

AYEKA
How?

RYOKO
For 5,000 years all I have been studying is math and science.

TENCHI
Well that should make third period a breeze for you.

AYEKA
I have been studying government, law, and business practices for 
seven hundred years.

TENCHI
So you have the last two classes solved.  With you two girls my homework 
is going to be easy.  We had better get going.  I will see you both in 
physics.

INT. School hallway - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko walk around the school.

Ryoko has a school map in her hand.

Tenchi follows the girls at a distance.

Ryoko stops at an intersection.

RYOKO
This damn map doesn't have a single star coordinate.  How's a space 
pirate to find her way around.

AYEKA
Let me look.

Ayeka takes the map.

RYOKO
Well, princess.

AYEKA
I'm looking!

RYOKO
Maybe you should turn it around?

AYEKA
Oh, I don't know!

Tenchi walks up behind the girls.

TENCHI
Let me help.

Both girls are startled.

AYEKA
Oh, Tenchi!

RYOKO
Are you following us?

Tenchi turns red.

TENCHI
Well, kind of.  We are both going to the Language Arts section.  See 
you are here on the map, and your classroom is here.

INT. Focus on school map as Tenchi points out the areas - DAY

AYEKA (O. C.)
Oh, it is in a different building.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Well, not really.  It's the same building, different floor.

Ryoko's finger points to the stairs on the map.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Oh, Oh, Oh, so this stairs and this stairs are the same!

INT. School hallway - DAY

TENCHI
Right!

RYOKO
Then we goooooooo, which way?

Tenchi points at the map.

TENCHI
Down this hallway.

Both girls look at him smiling.

Tenchi points down the hallway to the right

TENCHI
Down that hallway.

RYOKO
All right, let's go.

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko walk through the hallways.

They stop in front of the girl's classroom.

TENCHI
Please wait here in the hallway after class.  I will take you to the 
physics lab.

AYEKA and RYOKO
Okay Tenchi.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko enter the contemporary literature classroom.

The class is almost full.

They see two seats next to each other and sit down.

A boy sits to Ayeka's left and a girl to Ryoko's right.

RYOE
Hi there, I'm Ryoe.  You both are new here.

RYOKO
My name is Ryoko.  Yes, we came here this summer.

DAIJIRO
My name is Daijiro.  Where are you from?

AYEKA
Hello, I am Ayeka.  We are from Jurai.

DAIJIRO
Where's that?

RYOKO
It's on another planet, about 4,000 light years away.

Ryoe and Daijiro both stare.

Then Ryoe and Daijiro start laughing.

RYOE
Well if you don't want to tell us you don't have to.

AYEKA
I'm sorry but from a small farm village up north does not sound very 
exotic.

DAIJIRO
Ryoko what did you do to Mr. Ikuko?

RYOKO
He wants me to be a class tutor.

DAIJIRO
You can tutor me anytime Ryoko.

Ryoko's mouth drops open and Ayeka turns red.

RYOE
Really, Daijiro let them breathe first.

CHISA
Class, please come to order.  My name is Ms. Chisa.  First we will 
discuss your summer reading.

INT. Hallway - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko are standing in the hall staring out the window.

Both are fuming.

Tenchi enters the scene.

TENCHI
Hi there, how di...

Both girls turn to look at Tenchi.

TENCHI
What's wrong?

Both girls clutch Tenchi.

Several people in the halls stare as they pass.

RYOKO
Tenchi, she is so mean.  She said comics were contemporary trash.

AYEKA
She called soap operas the dregs of modern television.

TENCHI
Who said this?

AYEKA
Ms. Chisa.

RYOKO
She doesn't understand anything.

DAIJIRO
Hi Tenchi.

Both girls look at Daijiro.

RYOE
Hi Tenchi.

Both girls glare at Ryoe.

TENCHI
Hi Ryoe, Daijiro.  How are you two doing?

DAIJIRO
We were in class with, ah, your friends.

RYOE
Ms. Chisa really lit into them over their idea of literature.

TENCHI
Well we can deal with Ms. Chisa later.  We need to get to the physics 
lab now.

RYOE
Hey, we both have physics next.

INT. Physics lab classroom - DAY

The five enter the classroom.  Ryoko and Ayeka each have a hold one of 
Tenchi's arms and keep an eye on Ryoe.

KAZUHIKO
Hey, Tenchi, over here.

TENCHI
Be right there Kazuhiko.

AYEKA
Tenchi?

RYOKO
Where are you going?

TENCHI
Well I have been Kazuhiko's lab partner for as long as I can remember.

DAIJIRO
You could be my partner Ayeka.

RYOE
And you could be my partner Ryoko.

Ayeka looks lost and concerned.

RYOKO
We could be each other's partner, Ayeka.

DAIJIRO
Come on, if it doesn't work out we can change later.

TENCHI
You two should split up and meet some others.  You can compare notes 
later.

RYOE
It might be fun Ryoko, and it would give us a chance to talk.

AYEKA
Are you sure this is the right thing to do Tenchi?

Tenchi looks at Daijiro.

TENCHI
There should be no problems Ayeka.

Daijiro holds up his hands.

DAIJIRO
Not from me Tenchi.

Tenchi moves over to Kazuhiko's station in the back.

Daijiro and Ayeka move to a station near the front, and Ryoe and Ryoko 
take a station next to theirs.

INT. Close up of Tenchi and Kazuhiko - DAY

KAZUHIKO
Wow Tenchi.  Not one but two girlfriends.

TENCHI
Some people have all the luck, huh.  It makes up for last summer.

KAZUHIKO
Weren't you at the temple again this summer?

TENCHI
That's the best part.  Both of them are staying at the temple while here.

KAZUHIKO
So did you...  You know...

TENCHI
Watch it Kazuhiko, before I damage another set of lockers.

Kazuhiko holds up his hands.

KAZUHIKO
Sorry Tenchi.  I didn't mean anything.  I just wish I could live your 
life, mine is so dull.

TENCHI
Be careful of what you wish for.  What did you do this summer?

INT. Close up of Ayeka and Daijiro - DAY

DAIJIRO
Hello lab partner Ayeka.

AYEKA
Hello Mr. Daijiro.

DAIJIRO
Please just Daijiro.  Are you always so formal?

AYEKA
I'm sorry but it is how I was raised.

DAIJIRO
It's okay.  I think I know where I stand with you and Tenchi.  And 
believe me, I don't want to be on Tenchi's bad side.

AYEKA
Tenchi's bad side?

DAIJIRO
I have him in my kendo class, and I have competed with him in judo.  
I think I am pretty good, but Tenchi fights like a demon.  He's the 
best in the district.

AYEKA
Hmm, he never told me that.

INT. Close up of Ryoko and Ryoe - DAY

RYOE
Do you think I am competition for Tenchi?

RYOKO
I think everyone is competition for Tenchi.

RYOE
Well I for one will not try to steal him from you.  Truce.

RYOKO
Truce.  Are you Daijiro's girlfriend?

RYOE
Well we are friends.  To close to be boyfriend, girlfriend.  What about 
Ayeka?  She looks like your main competition for Tenchi.

RYOKO
We're friends also.  More like sisters.  We have agreed to not let a man 
get between us.

RYOE
Wow!  Now that is commitment.

INT. Physics lab classroom - DAY

AZAKA
Hello class.  My name is Mr. Azaka.  I welcome you to another year of 
advancing science.

Ayeka covers her mouth as she giggles.

DAIJIRO
What's so funny?

AYEKA
I have a dear friend named Azaka.  Mr. Azaka even talks like him.

AZAKA
Each station will come to the front and sign for equipment.  We will 
start with the back left station and move left to right, back to front.

Pairs of students move in an orderly fashion to get their equipment.

RYOKO
Mr. Azaka!  May I speak with you please?

Mr. Azaka moves to the front of Ryoe and Ryoko's station.

AZAKA
Hello Ms. Ryoe.

Mr. Azaka glances to his right.

AZAKA
Mr. Daijiro.  You two must be the new students.

RYOKO
My name is Ryoko.

AYEKA
I am Ayeka.

RYOKO
I would like to take your end of year exam now.  I would like to help 
you as class tutor.

Mr. Azaka looks amused.

AZAKA
Oh, really.  And what makes you think you can do that?

RYOKO
My previous teacher, Ms. Washu, has been teaching me quantum mechanics 
to include sub-atomic particles, and the effects of inter-stellar masses 
on light.

AZAKA
Ahh, ohh, umm...

Daijiro and Ryoe stare at Ryoko.

Ayeka giggles in her hand.

RYOKO
May I take the test please, Mr. Azaka?

AZAKA
Okay Ms. Ryoko.

Mr. Azaka moves to desk and pulls out an exam.

He returns to Ryoko's station.

AZAKA
Here you go.  There are four questions on observations for an experiment.

RYOKO
Unless it's transmuting lead to gold that should be no problem.

Ryoko starts filling out the exam.  Mr. Azaka watches her answer 
questions.

Tenchi walks by with his lab equipment, and looks at Ayeka.

Ayeka smiles and waves her hand.

RYOE
I will get our stuff, you stay there, Ryoko.

Ryoko finishes the exam.

AZAKA
Well there is no reason to check it.  You got 100%.  The job is yours.

Ryoko smiles sweetly.

RYOKO
Thank you Mr. Azaka.

Mr. Azaka returns to the front of the class.

INT. Close up of Ryoko, Ryoe, Ayeka, and Daijiro - DAY

DAIJIRO
Wow, you did that with Mr. Ikuko.

RYOE
You are a genius!  What happened with Ms. Chisa?

Ryoko sniffs and tosses her head.

RYOKO
Ms. Chisa does not understand contemporary or literature.

AZAKA (O. C.)
Now lets look at this year's curriculum.

INT. Physics lab classroom - DAY

Students have just finished putting away their equipment.

AZAKA
Class dismissed.

Tenchi joins the other four.

DAIJIRO
I was a perfect gentleman, wasn't I Ayeka?  So there is no reason for 
you to pound me in kendo class, Tenchi.

Ayeka giggles in her hand.

RYOE
Well I am off to music.

AYEKA
What do you play Ryoe?

RYOE
Harp.

AYEKA
That's a beautiful instrument!

RYOE
Does either of you play?	

RYOKO
I can't even hum.

AYEKA
I play a stringed instrument, the Koto.

RYOE
Now that is traditional.

TENCHI
I didn't know that Ayeka.

AYEKA
I do not perform in public.

TENCHI
Your next class is in the freshman wing.  Will you two find it okay?

RYOKO
If I can navigate the galaxy, I should be able to navigate a school.

Tenchi looks shocked.

DAIJIRO
Ayeka told me she was from Jurai.

Tenchi looks worried.

RYOE
Yes, and it is 4,000 light years away.

Ryoe, Daijiro, Ryoko, and Ayeka start to laugh.  Tenchi joins in.

TENCHI
See you to in government class.

DAIJIRO
Ryoe and I will see you there to.

RYOE
Bye.

INT. Hallway - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko walk through the halls.

AYEKA
Okay, I admit it.  I'm lost.

RYOKO
Don't look at me.

AYEKA
One of us is going to have to ask directions.

RYOKO
Don't look at me.

AYEKA
Well I am the prettier one.

RYOKO
What does that mean?

AYEKA
You would scare away anyone who tried to help us.

RYOKO
Oh yeah, we will see about that!

Ryoko sees a tall handsome boy approach.

RYOKO
Excuse me.

The boy rushes by.

Ayeka giggles in her hand.

AYEKA
What did I tell you?

RYOKO
Hummph.

A young boy approaches, and Ryoko steps in front of him.

The boy bounces off Ryoko and lands on his butt.

Ryoko rushes over to the boy.

RYOKO
Oh excuse me, I am so clumsy.

She picks the boy up smiling at him.

The boy blushes and looks at his feet.

BOY
It was my fault.  Are you a senior?

RYOKO
Yes.  And you?

BOY
A freshman.

RYOKO
Can you take us to the home and family development class, please?

BOY
Okay, it's this way.

The two girls follow the boy to their class.  The boy looks at his feet 
the whole way.

Ryoko lifts the boy's head and looks him in the eye.

RYOKO
Thank you my shinning knight, you have helped out this princess in 
distress.

Ryoko kiss the boy's cheek and goes into the classroom.

The boy looks stunned.

Ayeka follows Ryoko.

AYEKA
Thank you, young man.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Ryoko and Ayeka take a seat next to each other.

AYEKA
You enjoyed that, didn't you?

RYOKO
It was fun.  Do you think he will still be there when we leave?

AYEKA
If he is we will have no problem finding our next class.

MAKIKO
Welcome you two.  You are tardy today.  But as it is first day you will 
be excused.  My name is Ms. Makiko.

INT. Hallway - DAY

Ryoko and Ayeka enter the scene from the classroom.

RYOKO
That wasn't too bad.

AYEKA
It was kind of a review of the chores we do around the house.

RYOKO
It looks like our knight has found his feet.

AYEKA
Well according to this map the Gym is outside our classroom.

Both look out the window and see a large building.

RYOKO
Bingo!  Let's go.

Ryoko's stomach rumbles.

RYOKO
To lunch that is.

Ayeka looks at the map and frowns.

AYEKA
Oh my, we are here and the cafeteria is way over here somewhere.

Ryoko glances at the map.

RYOKO
We should be able to find it by supper.

Ayeka looks out the window and points.	

AYEKA
There is some picnic tables under the tree.

RYOKO
Won't Tenchi be looking for us in the cafeteria?

AYEKA
Yes, he will.

RYOKO
He will get worried.

Ayeka's face shows a sly smile.

AYEKA
Yes, he will.

RYOKO
You are a naughty one.

AYEKA
Let's go I am hungry.

Ayeka and Ryoko move off camera.

EXT. Picnic tables under tree with gym in background - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko sit at the picnic table putting away their stuff.

Ryoe enters the scene.

RYOE
Did you bring your gym clothes?

Follow me.  I will show you around.  Have either of you played field 
hockey?

Ryoko and Ayeka both shake their head no.

Ryoe leads them into the gym building.

EXT. Practice field with gym building in the background - DAY

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Ryoe exit the gym with the other girls in their class.

The group moves out onto the field where their instructor awaits them.

KIYONE
Hello everyone, my name is Ms. Kiyone.  Everyone line up for calisthenics.

RYOKO
Is this a small universe or what?

AYEKA
I hope she acts more like the Kiyone, instead of acting like Mihoshi.

RYOE
What are you two talking about?

AYEKA
Back home we know a police officer named Kiyone.

RYOKO
And one named Mihoshi.  Let's say Kiyone was brains and Mihoshi was brawn.

RYOE
I think you will get a little of both with coach Kiyone.

All the girls start stretching under the coach's guidance.

EXT. Running track - DAY

All the girls running around the track.

EXT. Close up of Ryoe, Ayeka, and Ryoko - DAY

Ryoe is winded.  Ayeka and Ryoko are breathing lightly.

EXT. Hallway - DAY

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Ryoe walk through the hallways.

Tenchi and Daijiro wait for the girls outside the classroom.

All five enter and take over the second row.  As viewed from the front 
left to right, Ryoe, Ryoko, Tenchi, Ayeka, and Daijiro.

AYEKA
Daijiro, how much of this class is how government works, and how much is 
local government history?

DAIJIRO
I'd say it's about seventy five percent how it works, and twenty five 
percent history.  Why?

AYEKA
As Ryoko is good at math and science, I am good at government and 
business.

RYOE
That's great.  Are you going to challenge the test?

AYEKA
Yes.  My weak point is local history although I did do some research 
over the weekend.

CUONG
Good afternoon class.  My name is Mr. Cuong.  We will start with the 
course agenda.

Mr. Cuong hands a stack of documents to a student in the front row.

Ryoko leans across Tenchi and motions to Ayeka.

Ayeka leans next to Ryoko.

RYOKO
When are you going to ask?

AYEKA
When he asks how I know so much, what do I tell him?

Ryoko face shows the Oh, I understand look.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Mr. Cuong is erasing the chalkboard.

CUONG
Well that covers everything we will do this year.  Please take the 
remaining time to review your materials.  I will walk around and answer 
individual questions.

Ayeka raises her hand.

Mr. Cuong walks up to Ayeka's desk.

CUONG
Yes, Ms. Ayeka.

AYEKA
Mr. Cuong, I have been a serious student of all forms of government.  
I would like to assist you as class tutor.  I am willing to take an 
exam today to show my qualifications.

CUONG
I can always use help.  Are you sure you are up to the job?

AYEKA
Yes sir.

Mr. Cuong returns to his desk and pulls out an exam.

He returns to Ayeka's desk.

CUONG
Here you go.  You need to score at least 90%.  You only have twenty 
minutes.

Ayeka takes the test and reads through it once.  She then starts 
answering questions.

Mr. Cuong moves around the room talking to students.

Mr. Cuong moves toward Ayeka's desk.

CUONG
Thank you for your attention.  Everyone is dismissed.  Ms. Ayeka, have 
you finished?

AYEKA
Yes Mr. Cuong.

CUONG
Please stop by after final class and I will let you know how you did.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Daijiro, and Ryoe gather together.

TENCHI
Well it's time for the last class.

DAIJIRO
Where are you heading next?

TENCHI
The three of us have business applications.

DAIJIRO
Ryoe and I finish in the chemistry lab.  See you three tomorrow.

takes a seat next to Ryoko.  A boy named Yuriko sits next to Ayeka.

KAZUHIKO
Hey Tenchi.  How has your day gone?

TENCHI
Pretty good so far.

Kazuhiko turns to Ryoko.

KAZUHIKO
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

RYOKO
Ryoko.  You must be one of Tenchi's best friends; he is always talking 
about you.

KAZUHIKO
Oh gee, that's nice of him.

Yuriko leans near Ayeka.

YURIKO
Hello there, my name is Yuriko.  What's yours?

AYEKA
My name is Ayeka.

YURIKO
How about going to the mall with me after class.

AYEKA
No, thank you.

YURIKO
Come on.  I can give you a ride home.  I have a Corvette.

AYEKA
That's nice.  I am afraid I am too busy to go out though.

YURIKO
I think you sho...

HIROSHIGI (overlapping)
Attention class.  I know it is near the end of the day, but please pay 
attention.  My name is Mr. Hiroshigi.  I will first pass out the class 
agenda.

As Mr. Hiroshigi hands papers to each row Ayeka raises her hand.

HIROSHIGI
Yes, Ms...

AYEKA
Ayeka, Mr. Hiroshigi.  I have studied for years under my father.  He is 
a successful businessman.  I would like to assist you in class if I may.

HIROSHIGI
What is your father's business?

AYEKA
He does import and export of manufactured goods and agriculture 
products around the world.

HIROSHIGI
Very good.  We will talk during study time.

Yuriko leans closer to Ayeka.

YURIKO
So you are to high and mighty for the likes of me.  I may have my father 
buy your father out of business.

Ayeka laughs in her hand.

AYEKA
You think quite a bit about yourself, don't you?

YURIKO
I certainly don't need any stuck up bitch.

Shock spreads across Ayeka's face.

Tenchi is looking daggers at Yuriko.

YURIKO
Stuff it Tenchi.  You can crawl back to that run down shrine of yours.

Ryoko smiles and waves at Yuriko.

RYOKO
Maybe you have time for me, Yuriko.

Tenchi gives Ryoko a questioning look.

YURIKO
I guess you will do.  I will see you after class.

HIROSHIGI
Attention please.  Let's review the agenda.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Mr. Hiroshigi stands in front of the class.

HIROSHIGI
We will finish the class with study time.

Please come up to my desk Ms. Ayeka.  We will discuss what you know 
about business.

Ayeka moves to the front.

Ryoko takes Ayeka's seat.

INT. Close up of Yuriko, Tenchi, and Ryoko - DAY

YURIKO
Let me take you to my place.  I'll show you something to study.

Ryoko takes on a look of innocence.

RYOKO
Oh, is it a big subject?

Tenchi grows hot

YURIKO
It should be more interesting than anything Tenchi could show you.

TENCHI
Keep it up and I will show you the stars spinning around your head.

YURIKO
With that little bamboo stick.  Have you ever even seen a real sword?

Tenchi grows madder.

RYOKO
My, my, all this talk about swords is making me hot.

YURIKO
You're a feisty one, heh?

RYOKO
You can't imagine.

Tenchi touches Ryoko's arm.

She turns and winks at him.

INT. Close up of Mr. Hiroshigi and Ayeka - DAY

HIROSHIGI
You are very knowledgeable Ms. Ayeka.  Your father must be very 
successful to have taught you so much.

AYEKA
You are very kind Mr. Hiroshigi.

HIROSHIGI
Please take this course material and lesson plans home.  They will 
help you prepare to assist me.

AYEKA
I will study them diligently, Mr. Hiroshigi.

HIROSHIGI
It appears your friend has taken your seat next to Mr. Yuriko.

AYEKA
Her name is Ryoko, and my friend is trying to save me from that boor.

HIROSHIGI
Mr. Yuriko's father is also very successful in business.  You must have 
dealt with him.  He controls most of the shipping in Japan.

AYEKA
Fortunately business dealings can be kept impersonal.  Unfortunately 
I must deal with him in class.  Thank you again, Mr. Hiroshigi.

Ayeka moves into Ryoko's old seat.

Tenchi touches her arm and smiles.

Ayeka smiles back.

YURIKO
So she is your new whore Tenchi.

Tenchi stands sending his chair to the floor.  His face is full of fury.

Ryoko and Ayeka stand and grab hold of him.

TENCHI
Anytime anywhere Yuriko!

HIROSHIGI
I will have order in my class.  Now sit down!

Tenchi bows low to Mr. Hiroshigi.

TENCHI
I humbly apologize for the disturbance sir.

All three sit back down.

Yuriko takes a hold of Ryoko's arm in a tight grip.

YURIKO
You're with me babe.

RYOKO
I think there is a nice quite spot behind the gym.

Tenchi looks at the two of them.

YURIKO
You can bring your lap dog, Ryoko.  Let's go.

Yuriko pulls Ryoko along to the exit.

Ayeka touches Tenchi's arm before he leaves.

AYEKA
You know she can handle him herself!

Ayeka looks in Tenchi's eyes.

AYEKA
But I know you must go.  She will need you.  I will go back to see 
Mr. Cuong, and then meet you at the gym.

Tenchi nods his head and follows Yuriko and Ryoko out of the classroom.

KAZUHIKO
Ms. Ayeka, would you mind if I accompany you?  I want to make sure you 
get back to Tenchi safely.

AYEKA
Thank you Mr. Kazuhiko.  That would be very nice.

Kazuhiko and Ayeka leave the classroom.

Do you think you can find enough reinforcements?

YURIKO
Shut up bitch.  I don't need anyone.

Ryoko's face takes on an evil smile.

INT. Classroom - DAY

Ayeka and Kazuhiko enter Mr. Cuong's classroom.

Mr. Cuong stands.

CUONG
Hello Ms. Ayeka.  You did very well on the test and scored 98%.  You 
only missed some questions on the European Community Council members.

AYEKA
You are very kind Mr. Cuong.  I am afraid they change to often for me 
to keep track of them.

CUONG
Yes they do.  If you still want the job as my assistant it is yours.

AYEKA
Yes, I do.  Thank you Mr. Cuong.

Ayeka and Kazuhiko leave the classroom.

EXT. Area behind the gym - DAY

The Track is to the right with the gym in the background.

Yuriko enters the scene dragging Ryoko.

Ryoko stops jerking Yuriko to a halt.

RYOKO
That's far enough.

YURIKO
Okay, we will wait here for your soon to be ex-boyfriend.

RYOKO
Is it an act, or are you really stupid?

Tenchi enters the scene.

YURIKO
Didn't think you had the balls to come here.

TENCHI
You won't have any when I am finished with you.

YURIKO
You are full of it.  And your time has come.

Yuriko and Tenchi take up a fighting stance.

A few blows are exchanged and Yuriko is down on the ground.

Five other boys enter the scene and line up behind Tenchi.

YURIKO
You're in for it now!

Tenchi spins to face the new threat.

Yuriko runs over to Ryoko.

RYOKO
Bad move Yuriko, you didn't bring enough.  I did warn you.

Yuriko grabs Ryoko around the chest and pulls a knife.

YURIKO
Shut up bitch!

Yuriko holds the knife against Ryoko's throat.

YURIKO
I am going to enjoy pounding the crap out of you Tenchi, and I am 
going to enjoy you later Ryoko.  Maybe that Ayeka to.

RYOKO
Help me Tenchi!

Tenchi spins and sees Yuriko with the knife, as Kazuhiko and Ayeka 
round the corner.

Tenchi lets out a yell and transforms into his battle armor with the 
Light Hawk Wing sword appearing in his hands.

The five boys behind him turn to run only to see Kazuhiko pounding his 
fist in his palm. 

Yuriko turns to run but is tripped up by Ryoko.

Tenchi leaps over Ryoko and lands in front of Yuriko.

Yuriko looks up to see the energy sword in is face and drops the knife.

The other five boys fall prostrate on the ground.

YURIKO
Please, I will give you anything!  Just let me go!

TENCHI
I think you wish to transfer to a new school Yuriko.  What do you think?

YURIKO
You will never see me again Tenchi!

TENCHI
I also think someone needs to apologize to two ladies.

Yuriko slowly backs away from Tenchi.  He turns and presses his face to 
the ground.

YURIKO
I humbly beg your forgiveness Ms. Ryoko!

RYOKO
Didn't like your window seat to hell, Yuriko.

YURIKO
Please Ms. Ryoko, I beg your forgiveness.

RYOKO
What do you think Ayeka?

AYEKA
I seldom think about the dead.

Yuriko shudders.

RYOKO
What you have done does not deserve forgiveness, but I don't want Tenchi 
to soil his blade with your blood.  You best scurry off while you can.

Yuriko looks up.

RYOKO
But Yuriko, I will be visiting you in your nightmares.

Yuriko crouches and runs off around the gym.

TENCHI
If everyone else is gone before I count to three, I will pretend I never 
saw them.  One...

The other five stand up and run around the gym.

Tenchi lets the sword go.

KAZUHIKO
That was amazing Tenchi.

TENCHI
Thank you Kazuhiko.  About what you saw...

KAZUHIKO (Overlapping)
What I will say I saw was six bullies chased off by a boy with a stick.

AYEKA
Kazuhiko kept me safe Tenchi.

Ayeka kisses Kazuhiko's cheek.

AYEKA
Thank you Kazuhiko.

Ryoko walks up to Kazuhiko.

RYOKO
Thank you for protecting my sister, Kazuhiko.

She kisses his other cheek.

TENCHI
You are a good friend, Kazuhiko.  We better hurry or we will miss our bus.

The four depart around the gym.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

EXT. Bus stop in front of school - DAY

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka board the bus.

They move to the back and find one young boy sitting there.

TENCHI
Could we have the seat please?  That way we can sit together.

BOY
I was here first.

AYEKA
I would greatly appreciate it.

BOY
What is it wor...

Ryoko flexes her hand.

BOY
Ouch!

The boy jumps out of the seat holding his rear.

BOY
Err, it must be a loose spring.  I think I will sit over here.

Ryoko smiles sweetly at the boy.

RYOKO
Thank you.

The three sit down with Tenchi in the middle.  He wraps his arms around 
the two of them and relaxes on the ride home.

EXT. Path leading to Tenchi's house - DAY

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka move along the walk as their bus leaves.

Ryoko and Ayeka are each wrapped around an arm.

RYOKO
You were so brave Tenchi.  I thought it was all over for me.

AYEKA
Thank you for rescuing my sister Lord Tenchi.  I don't think I could 
have gone on without her.

TENCHI
Not so thick please.  Thank you for stopping me in the classroom.

RYOKO
I have seen that look to many times in the past.  You would have killed 
him before he could have lifted a finger.

AYEKA
You are no longer the boy you once were Lord Tenchi.  Duty and 
responsibility will weigh heavy on you now.

RYOKO
Not if I can help it!

TENCHI
It wasn't a very fair fight.

AYEKA
Fairness is for games Tenchi.  In a fight it's win or lose, no more 
or less.

TENCHI
Are you saying the ends justify the means?

AYEKA
I lived through Kagato's attack on Jurai.  I read about KAIN's attack 
on Jurai.  I am saying that fairness is for the very strong or for 
those who have no stake in the events.

TENCHI
What would have happened to your sister, Ryoko, if your brother shared 
that attitude?

AYEKA
I didn't say what I believed was the right way; it is just that you 
need to know what I believe.

TENCHI
That is why I love you.  I will need your honest advice in the days 
ahead.  I can use it to counter Ryoko's advice.

Ryoko sniffs.

Tenchi wraps his arms around both girls.

TENCHI
So are we going back to school tomorrow?

AYEKA
Of course Tenchi.  I am assistant teacher in two classes.

RYOKO
Same for me, Tenchi, and I want to see what is behind the door in the 
teacher's lounge.

Tenchi laughs as they start up the stairs.

INT. Dining room table - NIGHT

Everyone except Grandfather is present in his or her usual place.

TENCHI
So who made what today?

SASAMI
Ryoko made the salad from scratch.  Ayeka made the dumplings.  Mihoshi 
made the noodles.  I made the rest.

TENCHI
Then I wish to thank you all before we start.

Everyone starts eating.

MIHOSHI
How was the first day of school?  I remember how much I dreaded the 
first day, and how much fun I had during the day.

RYOKO
Not to bad.  I had a good teacher to prepare me before I went.  Thanks 
mom.

WASHU
A dutiful daughter gladdens the heart.

AYEKA
Both of us got assistant teacher jobs in two classes each.

RYOKO
Guess what the name of the field hockey coach is Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
I don't know, Kiyone?

RYOKO
It figures.

TENCHI
See everyone, Mihoshi is always on top of things.  Nothing slips by the 
number one galaxy police detective.

Mihoshi blushes and covers her face with her hand.

AYEKA
Let me try.  Guess what the name of the physics teacher is Sasami?

SASAMI
Can I try two names?

Ayeka frowns.

SASAMI
Now I know it one of them.  Azaka or Kamidake?

AYEKA
Why do I bother?  Azaka.

RYOKO
Well guess what Tenchi...

Tenchi gives Ryoko a tight squeeze.

RYOKO
...did for us.  He introduced us to some new friends.

SASAMI
Wow, could we invite them over sometime?

TENCHI
That would be fun.  I would like to see their faces when they find out 
how many girlfriends I have.

Washu tries to look innocent.

WASHU
Could you stop in my lab for a minute after supper Tenchi?

RYOKO
Mom!

TENCHI
It's okay Ryoko.  Yes Little Washu I will stop in right after supper.  
But I have some other things to do tonight so please don't keep me 
to long.

WASHU
Thank you, Tenchi.

INT. Washu's laboratory - NIGHT

Washu is typing on her keyboard.

Tenchi enters through the stairwell portal.

WASHU
You generated the Light Hawk Wings today.

TENCHI
Yes.

WASHU
Explain your feelings to me Tenchi when you generated them.

TENCHI
I was angry.  Angry enough to kill.  A boy at school insulted Ayeka 
and Ryoko.  He hauled Ryoko away when I could do nothing about it.  
When I could confront him, he continued to insult everyone I hold dear.  
Then Ryoko yelled, "Help me Tenchi", and I knew if I didn't act I would 
lose her.

WASHU
You know now Ryoko was never in any danger from that boy.

TENCHI
I think Ryoko would have let him hurt her.

WASHU
Why do you think that Tenchi?

TENCHI
She desperately wanted me to save her, instead of saving herself.  
Ayeka knew that too, and told me so before I went after Ryoko.

WASHU
Thank you for coming here Tenchi.

TENCHI
Good night Little Washu.

Tenchi exits the lab.

WASHU (Expressed as thought)
Ryoko, Ryoko.  You did well today Ryoko.

RYOKO (O. C.)
Thank you, mom.

INT. Ayeka's room - NIGHT

Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami sit in the room.

There is a knock at the door.  Sasami answers.

SASAMI
Hello Tenchi.

Sasami turns and looks in the room.

SASAMI
Ryo-Ohki, lets go out for a walk.

RYO-OHKI
Meow!

Ryo-Ohki jumps into Sasami's arms.

TENCHI
You don't have to leave Sasami.

SASAMI
Ryo-Ohki likes her walks.  Bye-bye Tenchi.

Sasami leaves the room.

TENCHI
Ayeka, is this a public or private place?

Ayeka removes the cover over her Kato.

AYEKA
My mother taught me to play.  May I play for you Lord Tenchi?

Tenchi sits next to Ryoko.

TENCHI
Please.

Ayeka plays a love song on her Kato. (Melody to Forevermore)

TENCHI
What will you two do about your contemporary literature class?

RYOKO
How do we make her understand how much these comics teach life's basic 
lessons?

AYEKA
How can we show her life is reflected in the soap operas?

TENCHI
Just like you did for me now.  Write down your thoughts and turn in the 
paper to her.

RYOKO
What if that doesn't work?

Tenchi shows an evil grin.

TENCHI
Then I dice her up, see.

RYOKO
We will try Tenchi.  I won't let one class stop me from enjoying the 
day with you.

AYEKA
Let's invite Kazuhiko, Daijiro, and Ryoe over someday.

TENCHI
Yes lets do that.

Tenchi's face loses it smile.

TENCHI
What is the future going to bring us?  More like Yuriko.

RYOKO
I don't know Tenchi.  I don't know what our future will bring.

AYEKA
We can only hope for the best.

TENCHI
Play for me Ayeka.  Play until my sadness fades away.

AYEKA
Yes, Lord Tenchi.

Tenchi and Ryoko lean together watching Ayeka.

Ayeka plays her Kato.
