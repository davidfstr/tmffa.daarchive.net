"miya!"
"miya!"
"miya!"
"miya!"
Ryo-ohki was in the Masaki  garden  early in the morning.His miyaing  woke up 
the entire Masaki residence.
"miya!"
"miya!"
A bloodshot eyed , hungover Ryoko yelled "Thats enough Ryo-ohki!"
"miya,MIYA!"
The  second scream was louder and Sasami went running outside to see what was 
the matter with her small friend.
"whats wrong Ryo-ohki?"asked a worried Sasami.
"MIYA!,MIYA, Miyaaaaa!"
Sasami looked down at the garden floor.
"ohhhhh is that all Ryo-ohki?"
Sasami noticed that all the carrots that Tenchi had planted were gone.
Come on Ryo-ohki I think there's some carrots inside.
She scooped up Ryo-ohki and took her inside.
Sasami walked into the kitchen and picked up a carrot from a basket on the 
table.
"here you go girl!"
"MIYA!"
"hehehe!" laughed Sasami.
"What is going on down here?" asked a half-asleep Noboyuki.
"The carrots Tenchi planted are gone," said Sasami.
"Gone?" asked Noboyuki.
"But he was going to harvest them today,did Ryo-oki eat them?"
"I don't think so Ryo-ohki was quite shocked when the weren't there."
"ohhh geez,Tenchi is really going to be mad at this one!"

"WHAT?"screamed Tenchi.
"wait till I get that cabb-
"It wasn't Ryo-ohki,that ate them Tenchi," imformed Sasami.
"Then who ate them?"
"you dont think there is another Ryo-ohki do you Tenchi?" asked Sasami.
"I dont know..... could there be two Ryo-ohki's?"
Ryoko comes downstairs floating"what's up guys did I hear somthing about TWO 
Ryo-ohkis?"
"Only one person I know could make two Ryo-oki's"said Ryoko.
