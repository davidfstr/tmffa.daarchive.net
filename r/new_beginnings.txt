*things between these marks are actions/sounds/accents certain words*

***************************************************************

        A New Beginning

“Why does this have to happen to me?” said a man.

As he thought to himself there sitting in his chair starting at the absence
of  space.
 He had been taking his regular daily path around the sol system but found
some time to
 think by the window to space.As his mind went deeper into his thoughts he
noticed his
reflection in the window and grinned slightly.

<<What was I doing here wasting my time?>>

He then left the window to do his routine inspection of the ship
 when suddenly he fell to the ground by the sudden impact of the crash.
His scanning device would have warned him of an incoming ship but since
 the hyper-space portal had transported him right smack dab in front of the
cargo ship,
he crashed into it.

He immediately addressed his computer “Computer what the hell was that?”

Shortly it responded by telling him that he had just crashed into a class
one cargo ship.

<<Dammit that guy better have some good insurance with him>>

But he couldn’t help but wonder how he could have crashed since his ship had
one of the
 best navigating computers on it. Unknown to the man was that at this very
moment the
owner of the cargo ship was yelling their heads off.

(Woman's voices)  “Damage report...computer what did we hit?”

(Computer)  “It seems that we have hit the Marshall's flag ship Vertigo”

“By the way weren’t we supposed to rendezvous with it?” added the computer.

“Please don't tell me that's true” said the woman's voice to herself.

<<There goes my career>> she thought.

As he was just about got to his ships controls the other ship started to
hail him.
 He got the usual beep on the com-link and pushed the red button with
reluctance.
To his surprise though it was a woman's voice and not a man’s .
He was just about to ask her who she was and why she crashed her ship into
his,
 but was interrupted in mid-speech.

The first thing she said had paralyzed him.

“I’m greatly sorry for this accident Marshall and will do what ever it takes
to repay for it.”

He thought what Marshall?  Utterly confused with who she was calling
Marshall in his ship,
even though he knew better than anyone that he was the only one on board his
ship.

Just as he thought this though the woman said again,  “I’m very sorry
Marshall but, you just
 came out of nowhere.”

<<Why does she keep calling me that?>>

(Meanwhile.....on another ship)

“Flying through space is so much fun isn’t it Ryo-oki.”

A cabbits voice responds “Nyahhhh.” *bleep*, *bleep* A window popped in
front of the
 woman telling her the coordinates of the crashed cargo ship.

“Well, well, what do we have here.”

With a slight grin the woman then says, “Ryo-oki direct the ship in the
direction that distress
 call came from.”  “I think we’ll give Ayeka a visit now.”   Thinking about
the last time when
she almost caught.  “She’s too dumb to ever catch me though quickly
correcting herself.”

(back to the two crashed ships)

<<What‘s wrong with him>>

“Sir, I am waiting your commands...”

This startled him, as he regained him composure asked, “Why do you keep
addressing me as
a Marshall?”

“Sir, is this supposed to be some kind of joke” said the woman.

“I don’t know who you think I am, but you better have some good insurance
plan, cause the
 damages on my Vertigo don’t come cheap you know.”  He brought up the
computers damage
 report and analyzed how much the repairs would cost.

Unknown to them both, the other ship was gaining speed quite rapidly.

(other ship)

“Nyaa!!”

“What’s wrong” said the woman seeing as the ships control gems were
flickering red and moving
 awkwardly.

“What we can’t stop!”

<<At this speed who knows what’ll happen>> she thought.

She finally managed to self destruct her ships engines saying “I know it
hurts but try to put up with
 it for a while”

<<hope this slows me down>>

“Nyahh” said the ship in a grief response.  But it was too late the momentum
of the woman's ship
was too much and she crashed right into the Vertigo.

*Wham!*

“NO NOT AGAIN!” , he screamed just to see the oddly black ship speed crash
into him.

Ok calm down you just got trashed by two ships in one day.  Still getting up
from the blow to his
 ships main helm he finally managed to get up and addressed the other ship.

<<Uh, oh>>  The girl thought.  I didn’t see anything about the Marshall’s
ship being here.

<<damn its all her fault>> she though as she hit her chairs side.

“My life’s pretty much ended I guess” she sighed.

“Damage report” he asked the computer with engrossed look.  Upon this
command the computer
 displayed a pop up window in front of him.

(AI voice) “Shields zero percent......energy core beyond repair......engine
and boosters, structural
 integrity compromised.

<<I’m lucky to be alive>> as he was breathing in deep from the sudden
impact.

He joined a com-link between the two ships that were to the sides of him.

“I DON’T REALLY CARE WHY  YOU PEOPLE CALL  ME A MARSHALL, BUT YOU
 TWO BETTER HAVE GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THIS!!!”

With all this stress he fainted and everything around him soon went blank.
He awoke on a cold
 surface and knew some how instinctively that it wasn’t in his ship.  How he
awoke though was a
different story....

  “RYOKO!!!!” The other one screamed.   While blasts of some sort of energy
weapons could be
 heard in
 the distance.

He thought that this ship was being attacked so he tried to get up but soon
noticed his whole body was
 suspended by metal restraints that seemed to come out of nowhere in
particular.

He finally managed to get out if the restraints and immediately tried to
move to an exit looking door.
  Just as he opened the door he was transported to a room and this  sudden
change in the environment
 startled him as he me the floor closer than he wanted to.

 *thud*

“Ouch!,

<<that‘s smarts.......what a weird place >>  he thought as he look at his
surroundings partially with awe
and fright.

Still trying to focus on the sounds he heard earlier he began to walk in one
direction.  His boots clanked
 against the metal grid on the ground as it lit up.  He noticed a computer
pad nearby and went to it.
Each step illuminating as his weight fell upon it.

<<What a ship >>

Surprised at the interior of  the ship he look through on of the maps on the
screen and it told him
where he was.  Though the ship was big as he saw on the 3-D map that popped
up he figured he
 was on the cargo ship and instantly new where to look.  The bridge would
probably be where
 they were. who ever those people were.

(Meanwhile one the bridge)

 There were orange lasers flying past objects and leaving scorch marks where
they hit the wall.
 Through all of this the two women were fighting, one with purple hair and
red eye’s who the other
 called Ayeka. And the other one with cyan hair called Ryoko by the other.

They each exchanged charges at one another while making remarks like: “Well
Ryoko you’ve really out
done yourself this time attacking the Marshall’s ship.”

“Wonder what your punishment will be this time eh?”

“Maybe 700 years in a cave will give you time enough to think things
through.”

“I’ll kill you first Ayeka!!” Ryoko screamed.  Returning her attack with a
swift retaliation with a energy
bolt, but missed.

As he neared his destination he could just make out the sounds of a battle
on the bridge.
 The door opened and what he saw made him gape.

There were two women wearing battle suits one red and black, the other
brown and white with some
 other colors mixed in.  The two girls noticed the door opened and quickly
noticed someone was
standing there.

Through each of their minds they noticed something different about him this
time but did not dare
saying anything, since they had angered him already once before.

Just then Ayeka see that as a chance to make up for her mistake said, “With
her capture I will make

 amends for what I have done.”

“What are you talking about?”  he said.

This made her stop and  rethink what she had just hear from him.

 <<why does he keep on asking questions like he’s never been here before.>>

 <<it  was like he was a totally different person>>

 Last thing she remembered of him was that he ordered her to rendezvous with
his ship immediately
 and to not question him about it.

 <<He must have forgot>>

During this duration of time Ryoko noticed her opportunity and seized it.
She quickly grabbed Ayeka
by the neck head locking her, with her energy sword just under her victims
chin.

He saw this and immediately knew what could happen if he didn’t do something
now.

“STOP!” he yelled.

Ayeka surprised by his action in turn said, “Don’t waste your life over
mine, Marshall go ahead and kill her.

 “With what?!” “You mean you came all the way here without a weapon?.”

Looking kind of dumb said “Yeah?”  both women face faulted.

“Wow, your really not yourself today are you” Ryoko said.

“What do you mean by that?” in reply.

“You’re joking right?" she said in return.  But noticed a mark of confusion
on his face and decided that
 something was wrong with the Marshall this time and saw a opportunity to
strike.

She threw Ayeka down and grabbed him by the arm, “Your coming with me”

“Hey let me go, where are you taking me?” as he was saying this she
dematerialized on to her ship.

 “Your going to be useful to me before I get rid of you”

not knowing what this meant he swallowed a lump in his throat and  said,
“W-what do you mean by that”

“What happened” two log looking things materialized supporting her as she
got up.

“Where’s the Marshall?” she asked in a dazed tone.

“We are very sorry for not getting here sooner, but now Ryoko the space
pirate has him.” said the log
with the red symbol on it.

“How did she get him....didn’t he fight back?”

 “Nope” said the log with the blue symbol.

 “Why not?” she said

There was something drastically wrong with the Marshall this time because
Ryoko knew as good as
 Ayeka that he was one of the best fighters in the universe well with his
power’s and all.

And it wasn’t like it for him to just give up at a demand especially since
he was the Marshall of their
sector.

(On Ryoko ship)

“Hey wake up sleepy head” said a sultry voice.

“W-where am I” he said while feeling his forehead.

 Seeing this she grabbed him by the wrist and flew him to a room with one
bed and said,  “Wait here
 I need to take a shower ok”

She then dumped him on the bed and began to walk to a light blue door.

“Oh yeah sure”   he replied in tired voice.

He then froze as he became fully aware at what she just said.

“S-shower?”  <<No I had to have been hearing things>>

He turned to see Ryoko head off to another door while undressing herself. He
quickly closed his eyes.

 As he clutched at his nose while it started to bleed

“uhhh.....” he said barely manage to mutter

<<What did I do to deserve these things>>

Ryoko suddenly turned around and said.  “No peeking now” with a slight grin
and then vanished inside
 the other room.

As he heard this he felt a familiar nose bleed coming on <<This is going to
be one of those days>>

 He knew he had to escape, so once he saw her enter the room he decided to
have a look around the ship.

He had to admit though she knew how to live.  The ship was not as big as his
but was still *very*
spacious.  He looked around the place wondering where his ship was.

 As he approached a small window near the room he decided to take a look
outside.  As he did this he
 heard a loud beep.

Then all of a sudden a “nyahhh” came out of nowhere.

 <<Hey this ship is alive,  no way>>  He had never been on one before and
realized it was trying to warn
 him of something but he didn't know what it was.

He felt a sudden slight wind and scented bath soap.  He turned around to
find Ryoko still wet with suds
covering *certain* parts of her body.

 Quickly he had backed a way and could feel his nose started to bleed.

<<if these things keep happening I’m going to die of blood loss>>

“uhh...maybe you should get dressed first?”

 “Something the matter Tenchi?” she said with a grin on her face.

As she said that she phased into her battle suit all dry and *fully*
clothed.

<<how does she know my name?!>> Tenchi thought

Both were soon interrupted by a hit to the ships hull.  This made them
almost fall.

As Ryoko regained her composure she said, “Ryo-oki lets get out of here!
fast!”  soon as she said
that the ship started to weave and dodge the laser volleys.

“Shoot she recovered faster than I expected, but I should have guessed that
from the way she nags
at everyone like a.....”

“Like a what!, Ryoko”  Ayeka voice and picture popped out of nowhere to
right in front of them.

 Ryoko grabbed Tenchi standing next to her and dematerialized to the bridge.

 “So what brings you here after me” she said.

“You know what the hell I mean” she responded.

“Oh so your still trying to get your promotion from the Marshall by sucking
up to him.”  almost laughing.

 “T-that’s absurd you-you monster woman”

“Wow such harsh words, I‘m hurt..*really*”

Thinking of some kind of comeback she couldn’t and they just glared at each
other sparks flying
 between their eye’s.

“I’m coming over there Ryoko,” With this a Ayeka teleported on to Ryo-oki
and prepared to do battle
once more.

Tenchi barged into the bridge saying, “Can someone please tell me  what the
heck is going on here?”

This made them both stare back at him.  Feeling kind of nervous he scratched
his neck, with sweat
starting to bead on his forehead.

 “You really don’t know where you are do you?” not knowing anything Ryoko
else to say.

“Don’t talk to the Marshall like that” said Ayeka.

 “I’m sorry sir but she doesn’t know what she’s saying”  some how she too
wondered what was wrong
 with him so she had no authority behind her voice.

 He paused but then seeing their confusion said “Yes, I *really* don’t know
where I am”

This shocked both women till Ryoko once again broke the silence.  “I knew
there was something wrong
 with you the first time I saw you on that cargo ship”

 “The only thing that I remember he said was that I was searching for a new
part for my ship when I got here”

        “So who are you?”  both women asked with a confused look on their
faces.

<<I guess I owe  them owe them an answer>>  Besides he wanted to get on with
his life and forget that
 this ever happened.

 During this both girls had their jaws opening till he finished.

<<Hmmm.....>> Ryoko thought to herself  <<maybe I'll have some more fun with
this guy since of course
 this isn’t against the law.  And now that I know for sure that he isn’t the
real Marshall>>  This made her grin.

Tenchi noticing this wondered why and became a little scared at what Ryoko
was *thinking*

Ayeka thinking herself didn’t notice. Where did he come from then if he
wasn’t the real Marshall  And
 what about the *real* Marshall, what had happened to him.  She desperately
needed an answer so she
 decided idea to ask the one person that knew almost... everything.

 She blinked and shook her head to wash all her thoughts away and apologized
to Ryoko for her actions.

Ryoko surprised at the officers action didn’t say a thing.

 Tenchi feeling lost in this new world knew nothing of what to do next.
<<just want to go home>>
All of a sudden he blurted out, “How do I get out of here?”

 Ayeka seeing his worried eyes decided this is what she could do to make up
for what had happened to
 him in this one day.

“Tenchi I would like to make it up to you by finding out how to get you back
home.”

“Would that be alright?” She added

Ryoko knowing that she had to act fast said, “Tenchi do you want to stay
with me till she finds a way to
get you home?”  He appreciated both of their hospitality but...some how he
had a bad feeling about this.

<<He won’t want to stay with me after all of *that*....better give him a
little more *incentive*>> thought Ryoko.

 “Aren’t you tired, I bet you are, why don’t you spend the night on my ship”

Tenchi felt a synapse surge through him but his body just kind of froze
there.

He suddenly remembered that there was only *one* bed....well that he only
saw one bed while there.

“Can’t I just stay on *my* ship while you two figure something out?“  he
said as he slowly started to move
 backwards.   He almost tripped from the unfamiliar surroundings.

Ryoko then caught him before he fell any further than requested that Ayeka
do her part as well.  Ayeka all
 the time in shock at how fast it had happened.

<<That woman or what ever she is will never change>> she thougt to herself.

She sighed in disgust and went back to her ship, but also at the same time
felt saddened at Tenchi not being with her.

  She caught herself thinking this and quickly said to herself  “Don’t be so
carefree, you know that you have
 a even greater responsibility to find the real Marshall now.  Even after
reassuring herself though she couldn’t
help but think what Tenchi was doing now..... alone with that *woman*.

 She shuddered and beamed back on to her ship.  She searched for the person
she knew had the answer to
all their questions.

(Back on Ryo-oki Ryoko’s ship)

 Tenchi and Ryoko rematerialized into the same room they had been in only a
couple of minutes ago.

 This made him worry even more,  if there *was* only one bed in this entire
ship.

Noticing his reaction Ryoko grinned.

“So Tenchi what do want to do with your *spare time* here” she seductively
whispering into his ear.

 “Well um...don’t you think that other girl Ayeka will find that person
she’s looking for and get me out of here.”
replied why scratching the back of his neck

“You don’t want to go that eagerly do you Tenchi.”  almost begging in her
saddened voice.

 Felling sudden swept of remorse he said “No I guess... not yet at least”
<<Why am *I* the one feeling sorry
for her he thought>>  <<I should be the one she is saying sorry to>>

Quickly that thought faded as he knew he could never do anything like that
to *anyone*

  That was his weakness being to kind sometimes that it hurt others around
him.  Ryoko face brightened as he
 said this even though she had just met this guy she felt she had known him
from another life and felt closer with
 ever word he said.

<<Didn’t I say I would kill him if I ever saw him again?!>>

<<No, this one is different...he’s not the Marshall he’s someone I’ve been
looking for a long time>>

<<I really need to get out more>> she thought smiling/blushing to herself

She then had an interesting idea.  “Tenchi why don’t you take a bath and
relax, it looks like you really need
one after today.”

He though it would be a good idea too but then remembered that she would
probably.....as she put it *peek*
 inside somehow.  He couldn’t just say no however since he felt that a bath
*would* help.

 <<besides I don’t want to hurt her again>> <<she doesn’t deserve that>>

So he agreed and once inside closed the door and locked it.  <<Just incase>>

He was amazed at how nice the bath was inside.  It was circular with blue
trimmings of tile that reflected
their color into the pools lightly lit surface.  Once he was in he felt his
joints start to relax finally after a very
 weird and stressful day.

(On board the other ship) Ayeka found who she was looking for.

“Washu?” she said knocking on her door.  Before she could enter though she
was teleported by some
unknown means and when she could see found herself in a lab.

An angry red haired girl (looks around 12 years old by the way) sat in the
middle of the lab staring at her.

“Miss Washu could you please help me with something?”  Ayeka asked

The little red hair girl just stood there with her arms folded in front of
her chest.

Ayeka saw this and started to fume.  She caught herself though before she
said anything.

“*Little* Washu could you please do something for me?”

<<yeah right little she’s twenty thousand years old!!>>  she thought angrily
to herself.

 “By the way you should really do something about that door, I don’t like
it”

“But its one of my greatest inventions.” retorted the redhead.

 “*Perfect* in every way.” she added.

“Well anyway you didn’t come to talk to you about my door so lets get on
with it.”

 “What do you need Ayeka?” said the scientist.

“Well *Little* Washu” she began knowing that if she ever wanted help from
her she needed to get on her good side.

 “I was wondering if you could tell me if there was any unusual activity
within the past couple of hours?”

 “Now that you mention it Ayeka, there has been.”

 “You see there was a shift in the time continuum.... as she went on she
noticed Ayeka getting confused
with every word.”

“Ayeka to put it short there was a portal and there seemed to be a
momentarily shift in time which something
 could have happened like say the switching of two places, you know that
sort of thing.”

“Um yes, that’s what I was wondering since the Marshall or the real one at
least was switched with another
one from a different dimension or something.”

“What really?!”  <<serves him right>>

 <<Hmm.. this maybe my chance to get away from this hell hold job and go
somewhere that I might be appreciated>>

“*Little* Washu please can you help me to find the missing Marshall.”

“I will see that you get rewarded greatly.”

“Since of course is the ruler of this sector and all.”

“Oh that's even better more money so I can finally get that space
defragmenter I have been wanting to use
 on my latest invention.”

 “Ok I’ll do it but it won’t come cheap, and you have better be ready to pay
up when your share is due.”

 “Of course Washu, anything.”

 (Back in the bathroom) Tenchi almost fell asleep in the warm water when
*knock, knock, knock*

“Tenchi you’ve been in there kind of long is there something wrong?”

Startled by the sudden noise he almost jumped out of the water making a
slight splash around him.

“No I’m fine” feeling relieved that he had remembered to lock the door.

“Oh don’t you need clothes to change into?”  Ryoko asked innocently

Tenchi had forgot since he was so tired that he had no clean clothes to
change into.

 <<How am I going to get my clothes like this he thought>>

 <<damn I should have remembered>> Now kind of regretting the bath.

“Don’t worry I’ll get something for you to wear.”

He saw her shadow leave from the door then a few moments later return.

“Tenchi please let me in”  he pause for a moment then figured he had to at
least for  a couple of seconds.
To get his clothes of course.  Ryoko new her plan was about go into action
so she got ready to give him *his clothes*

Reluctantly he said “Ok, I guess” but before he said that had already made
sure he was at least wearing a
 towel below his waist then unlocked the door.

 Ryoko turned the knob and pushed the door open.  Tenchi tried to grab his
clothes from her before the
door opened too much.

Soon he noticed that she had *her* clothes not his.

“Ryoko” he said getting worried.

“W-where are *my* clothes” sweat slowly starting to bead up all over his
body.

“Oops, wrong ones” she said trying not to smile.

 Once he heard this he started to close the door but she was too strong for
him and soon the door
slammed wide open.  He was going to run but to where he thought.

“Ryoko what are you doing?” he asked knowing the answer already.

<<some one just kill me here cause I’ll probably die after this>>

She was looking at the top part of his body and noticed from the steam in
the room he looked pretty good,
 for he was built slightly and looked good in just a towel.

 This made her almost lunge at him.  She held her hormones back but still
managed to blush and take a step closer.

Tenchi seeing this took another step back.  They did this for a while until
he hit the wall behind him and
realized there was no where left to run.

Ryoko started to move closer and closer till Tenchi tried to in horror flee.
Seeing this she blocked his way
with her body and Tenchi just bumped into her chest making him kind of
dizzy.

 After recovering he noticed that he wasn’t in the bathroom anymore and was
slightly relieved.
 Only now he found himself lying on the bed with something next to him.

Suddenly a soft hand grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around.  He
turned to see Ryoko’s
 beautiful yellow eye’s piercing his own.  He then noticed that they were
both under the blankets him wearing
 only his towel not counting what she wasn’t wearing.

“Wait a minute...what are you doing?” he said while blushing

Seeing this made him blush which just made Ryoko even more interested in
him.

“mnpfff” was his next word as Ryoko muffled him with a kiss.

 He was in shock for a couple of seconds and then when came back to reality,
quickly pushed himself back
 with his hands on her shoulder for support.

He saw where his hands where and the other *things* around that area, and
felt almost like fainting but his
 mind said to flee and kept him conscious if not at least semi-conscious.

Saddened by his sudden move Ryoko sat up and turned around facing away from
Tenchi.

<<It‘s me isn‘t it>>  she thought, but then realized she had also said it
aloud.

Fully awake now Tenchi realized what he had done and felt a wave of guilt
wash over him.

“No...its not you” he said to the figure with cyan hair across from him on
the bed.  He held his head low still
 closing his eyes when he heard...
