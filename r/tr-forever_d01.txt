Tenchi &Ryoko:  Forever Dreams  Chapter 1: (Regualar)

As you recall, Ayeka had just played a cruel trick on Ryoko and she reacted
rather bad to it.  Now, we continue:

******************************************************************************

**********************************

Ryoko emerged from Washu's lab with her regular cyan hair, and
spiderwebless.
 Her rage toward Ayeka was not forgotten though.
It had only subsided a little.  Ryoko stepped into the kitchen, she glared
down at Ayeka, Ayeka only smirked.  Tenchi and Sasami
glared at Ayeka and she caved.

"I am sorry for my um, childish trick."  Ayeka was having difficulty saying
this.

Ryoko glared, and as if just noticing Tenchi, glomped onto him.  Ayeka was
about to jump up and start protesting but looked down
at her sister and decided that she owed Ryoko this.  She sat down at ate.
Not happy at all about the mornings precedings.

Tenchi groaned, "Honestly Ryoko, do you have to start this this early?"

"Yup"

Just then, an angry Kiyone stomped down the stairs, dragging a still
sleeping
Mihoshi behind her.  She entered the kitchen looking
very distressed.  "How long can she sleep?  I mean honestly!  She could
sleep
through a earthquake!"

Sasami giggled, she was at the stove making breakfast.

At the smell of food, Mihoshi woke up.  "Oh, breadfast, hey Kiyone, why
didn't you wake me up?  How did i get down here anyway?"

KIyone sighed exhastedly and started to shake Mihoshi violently, "YOU ARE
SUCH A DITZ, YOU ARE SO IMPOSSIBLE!!!"

When she finished, Mihoshi took her place at the table and started to eat.

"Oh, Lord Tenchi, I have some...news for you, well, all of you actually."

"What is it Ms. Ayeka?"  inquired Tenchi.

"Well, Sasami and I have been called away to a meeting of the Council of
Jurai.  We have been requested personally by my father.

Sasami frowned at the stove, this was gonna be a long meeting, it wasn't
sitting in the room for a long time that upset her, it was the
fact that she would have to leave her family, the people here she loved.  To
Sasami, this was her home.  Sure, her mother and father were
back at Jurai, and she loved and missed them, but, this place seemed to
appeal more to the little princess.  A single tear slid down her
cheek.

"This meeting will be about one month long.  I'm afraid there is no way I
can
get out of it."  Ayeka continued.

"It's ok Ayeka, we understand." said Tenchi.

"Yeah, Jurai is your first priority pricess, have fun, and give my regards
to
Azusa!"  teased Ryoko.

Ayeka glared at her.  Ryo-ohki, who was on top of Sasami's head watching her
cook, gave a sad miya.  She was sad that her best friend had
to leave her for any amount of time.

"And i want you,"Ayeka pointed at Kiyone,"to watch out for her, I dont' need
Ryoko doing anything to harm Tenchi in anyway."

"Wouldn't dream of gaining a head start on you princess.  Don't flatter
yourself.  You're so selfish!  Honestly!"

"What was that Ms. Ryoko?!"  Ayeka yelled back at her.

Tenchi rolled his eyes, 'Here they go again' he thought.
"Please you two, take it outside.  Give my house a rest for once."

Kiyone tried to break the fight as well.  "Besides, I can't.  Mihoshi and I
have to make a report to HQ then do our patrol.  That's gonna
take quite a while."

"WHAT!  You mean to tell me that she is going to be alone with MY TENCHI?!"

"Hold on princess, YOUR Tenchi?  I don't think so!"

"What about Washu?" asked Sasami.  Everyone tried desperately to break up
the
ensuing fight.

"Nope," Washu simply stated, "an experiment that's gonnna take quite a
while."

Ayeka was burning with rage right now.  How could they do this to her?  The
crown princess of Jurai, she was now taking a back seat to a
lowly space pirate.

Mihoshi had the answer in a simple, clueless sentence, "Well, Nobuyuki and
Katsuhito, or was is Yosho, anyways they will be here, right?"

This made Ayeka feel a little better.  She knew her brother would look after
Tenchi and keep Ryoko under control.  Ayeka sighed, finally a
little satisfied.

Finally, Sasami spoke the words the whole house wanted to hear, "BREAKFAST
IS
READY!"

******************************************************************************

**********************************

After breakfast, Ayeka and Sasami went to pack.  Kiyone and Mihoshi were out
on patrol already, and Washu was in her lab doing some sort of
experiment.  Tenchi was pondering his predicament in his room.  He was to be
all alone with Ryoko, the idea almost made him sick.  'Great, this
is going to be wonderful.'  He thought.  His thoughts trailed back to the
fight they had last night and the one this morning.  Why was Ryoko
willingly giving in, she never used to do that.  Was something wrong?  He
had
to ask, hopefully, that was all he was going to do, and not get
caught up in another one of those two's fights, often, when he tried to talk
to one of them, the other would find them and start arguing.  he was
hoping to find Ryoko by herself, just to talk of course.
The first place he looked was her cave, and sure enough, there she was, lost
in thought.  She hadn't even heard Tenchi approach.

"Ryoko?"

Ryoko jumped.  "Hm, oh Tenchi, what did you want.  I was just here thinking
about something."

"Um, sorry about that,  yeah, I had to ask you somthing, it's been bothering
me since this last week actually."

"Yes what is it?"  Ryoko seemed even now lost in her own thoughts.

"Well, I was just wondering, your fights with Ayeka, you seem to be givin in
so much easier.  Just quiting them."

"Well, i just saw no point in continuing, I beat her and instead of
humiliate
her, I just quit."

"It's not that, somethings wrong with you."  Tenchi stated flatly.

Ryoko was somewhat taken aback, this was not the usual Tenchi.  "I just have
a few things I would like to sort out myself."

Tenchi was a little worried, usually when Ryoko acted this way, something
bad
was about to happen.
Ryoko noticed the look on Tenchi's face and consoled him.  "Don't worry,
this
is my problem, nothin's gonna happen.
Tenchi still wasn't convinced but decided to leave it at that.  "Ok, are you
going to come and see Ayeka off, she is leaving
tomorrow you know?"

"Yes, I know, I'll be there, just, let me be for now."

Tenchi was a little surprised at this comment.  But, respecting Ryoko, he
left her.  However, he was still a little nervous, 'Why was she
acting this
way, this was not the regular Ryoko, somthing had happened.' Tenchi thought,
walking back to the house.

That night, Ryoko lie on her rafter, unable to sleep.  Lately, she had
rarely
been sleeping in her room, it just didn't feel right.  Now, what
happened earlier that morning, she wasn't going to sleep in her room until
Ayeka was gone.  She just couldn't sleep.  Ryoko sighed heavily and
teleported on the couch.  'Much more comfortable.'  she thought to herself.
She eventually fell asleep, although, this proved not such a good
idea.
In her dream, she was in a dark room, no light, but somehow, she knew
someone
was there, she could feel it.  Then, she heard a voice, one so ice
cold, it froze her, she couldn't move.  "Hello my little pet.  How was your
day?"  the voice asked.
Ryoko could not respond.
A light came on from somewhere.  It shown in the middle of the room, there
she saw a figure that could only be in her worst nightmares.  Kagato
stood there, he scowled at her.  He walked up to her and slapped her across
the face, "Answer your master when he asks you a question!"  HE scolded
her.
When Ryoko still did not answer, Kagato grabbed her by the neck and drained
her of the energy in her gems.  When he was finished, Ryoko fell to the
ground, unconcious.  Kagato proded her with his foot and muttered
"Worthless,
completely worthless."

Ryoko woke to see her mother looking worriedly at her.

"What?"  Ryoko said, rather weakly, she felt very weak most likely from the
dream.

"Do you have any idea what time it is?" asked a concerned Washu, "it's 1
o'clock"

"WHAT, HOW COME NO ONE WOKE ME UP?" yelled Ryoko.

Tenchi was also there, "Because no one could.  We started to get really
worried."

Ryoko suddenly felt better and got up.  "I have to talk to Ayeka.  Where is
she?"  Ryoko demanded more than asked.

"She's in her room.  Ryoko, what happened?  Why won't you tell me?" Washu
asked.

"Why do I have to?"

"Ryoko, I am your mother..."

"I have no mother."  Ryoko cut her off.

"And who told you this?"  Washu demanded.

"Kagato."  Ryoko said rather quietly.

"And he also said you were worthless, weak, no one would love you.  I can't
even count how many lies he has told you, he is gone now.  Ryoko let him
go, he will never hurt us again, you don't have to think your emotions are
weak anymore.  They are not, please, I AM your mother, i only want the best
for you.  Let me know at least a little about you." Washu pleaded.

Ryoko looked over at Tenchi and he nodded.

"I am fine, I promise."

"Mom"  she added.

Washu looked compationately at her daughter as she walked up the stairs to
Ayeka and Sasami's room where they were packing.

A knock came at the door and startled Ayeka, Sasami giggled at her sister.
Ryo-ohki, who was with them, trying to spend as much time with Sasami as she
could, miyad happily.

"Very funny you two," stated Ayeka going to the door.  She opened the door,
"Oh, you, what do you want."

"Love the enthusiasm pricess."  said Ryoko

"It certainly took you long enough to wake up.  I presume you were having a
good sleep?"

"Not exactly."  Ryoko responded.

Ayeka's eyes suddenly looked full of pity, she knew what had happened.

"Look, I don't need your pity Ayeka, I just want to make a peace, until you
get back."

"What?" inquired Ayeka suspiciously.

"Listen, can we talk in private?"  asked Ryoko nervously

"Um, sure, I suppose so."  Ayeka gave Sasami a look and she picked up
Ryo-ohki and left.

"Come on Ryo-ohki, let's see how Washu's doing on Ryu-oh."  suggested
Sasami.

"Miya"

"Ok, listen," Ryoko said, stepping in Ayeka's room as she closed the door,"I
don't want to do this but I am for my reasons.  I've decided to give you a
break, let's make a pact, I promise that I won't even touch Tenchi while you
are gone."

"And what reason would I have to trust you?" Ayeka asked crossly.

"What other choice do you have?"  Ryoko challenged.

"Fine, I cannot believe I am doing this."  Ayeka reached out her hand and
Ryoko grabbed it and they shook.
Ryoko smirked.  Ayeka pulled her hand away.  "Now, if you don't mind, I have
to finish packing."

"No one's stoping you."  Ryoko walked out of the room.

The rest of the day went on as usual.  Ryoko and Ayeka constantly fighting.
Mihoshi and Kiyone had already left for what Kiyone said was going to be
about
1 month.

******************************************************************************

****************************************
(The Next Morning)
Everyone woke up early to see Ayeka and Sasami off. Ryo-ohki insisted to see
them at least a quarter of the way.
Ayeka kept her composure in saying good-bye. Ayeka walked over to Tenchi to
say something, but instead she kissed him on the cheek. Ryoko got really
mad,
but
Ayeka just winked at her and was beamed aboard Ryu-oh. Sasami on the other
hand was crying.
The small crew on board Ryo-ohki watched as the space ship disappeared. They
then traveled back to Earth.

Back on Earth, Tenchi looked questioningly at Ryoko, and asked, "What did
you
talk to Ayeka about?"

Ryoko says, "My aren't you a pry?"

Tenchi blushed.

"If you must know, it was about you," Ryoko teased,"anyways, I promised
Ayeka
that I would not go near you until she gets back, a sort of insurance
thing."

"Why did you do that?"

"So, you want me to?" Ryoko teased again.

"What, NO!"  Tenchi yelled.  Ryoko only smiled.  "I'm just asking why you
would do something like that."

"Because, I want to prove to that brat that I can do something worth notice,
and not harm anyone."
She began to walk away, but turned around to say one thing, "and I intend on
keeping that promise."  She smiled sweetly and walked back to the hosue.

Tenchi smiled and rolled his eyes, "I never knew anyone so stubborn."

"Thank you Tenchi!" Ryoko replied.

Tenchi looked stunned cause Ryoko actually heard him. Then replied, "WOW,
you
actually heard me?!"

Walking towards the house she replied, "Why wouldn't I?"  It was killing
Ryoko that she couldn't glomp onto Tenchi like she usually could.  So,
rather
than drive herself
crazy, she decided to go home and take a nap.

Inside the house, Ryoko floated up to her rafter and closed her eyes.
Tenchi
had gone to work in the family carrot fields.  Ryo-ohki was driving him nuts
by eating all
the carrots he pulled out of the ground.  "RYO-OHKI STOP IT!  Go and keep
Ryoko company."  Ryo-ohki sulked back to the house.
When she arrived, she saw the tail of Ryoko's dress swaying back and forth.
Not being able to resit it, Ryo-ohki jumped at the tail and dug in with her
claws and bit it.

Ryoko shot awake as a jolt of pain seized her back.  As instinct, she shot
her head up and smacked it on the ceiling and fell back on the rafter.
After
this, she fell none
to gently onto the floor and landed atop a shocked Ryo-ohki.

"Miya"  cried Ryo-ohki weakly.

"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING?!"  Ryoko grabbed the little cabbit by the
scruff of the neck and started to yell at it.

"Miya miya miyaaaa!"  wailed the little cabbit.

"Whatever, look, she'll be back sometime, in the mean time, this," she said
picking up the tail, "is not a toy mouse or somthing, you know when I wear
this, it becomes a part
of me."

"Miya"

"Don't worry, aside from a giant bruise, I'll be fine.  Hey, I have an idea,
let's make lunch for Tenchi.  This house looks like it could make do with a
small cleaning too."

"Miya?"

"I dunno, maybe it's because Sasami's gone, or I just feel in a cleaning
mood, weird huh?"

"Miya miya." Ryo-ohki agreed.

Ryoko and Ryo-ohki stepped into the kitchen and noticed the stack of dirty
dishes from breakfast.  Sasami hadn't time to wash them.
'Oh well' Ryoko thought, "I guess we start here Ryo-ohki."

The former pirate and the cabbit went to work, fixing up things, washing the
dishes, wiping off the stove. scrubbing the table, sweeping the floor.
Ryoko
stood up from sweeping
and wiped sweat from her brow.  "Phew, this is hard work Ryo-ohki, well, I
think this does it for the kitchen, let's get lunch started."

"Miya!"  said Ryo-ohki excitedly.

"No, no carrots this time, I'm makin lunch," Ryoko noticed the now saddened
face of her faithful cabbit, "oh fine, I'll make you something special."

"Miyaaaaaaaaaa!"

Ryoko giggled at the little cabbit, "I thought that would make you happy."

Suddenly, a thought entered Ryoko's mind, 'I won't be joining you for the
meals while I am working ok sweety?"

"So the experiment is more important, and don't call me that!"  Ryoko
appeared to be talking to herself but in fact, she was conversing
telepathincally with Washu.

'You know what I mean, and why not?'

Ryoko rolled her eyes and began to cook something on the stove.
When it was done, Ryoko thought aloud to herself and Ryo-ohki, "Do you think
he would appreciate me bringing it to him, I mean, he did leave without any.
Perhaps he is hungry."

'Now Ryoko,' Ryo-ohki's thought entered her head, 'you know the pact you
made
with Ayeka.'

"I didn't forget, I was just wondering if he was hungry.  I'll be right
back."  Ryoko saw the concerned look on Ryo-ohki's face, "I promise, you are
as bad as Washu."

******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************

*************

As a matter of fact, Tenchi was rather hungry.  He was thinking of going
back
to the house and finding something to eat.  He could see it now, Ryoko
taking
a nap on her rafter while
the house went to shambles, something burning on the stove, Ryo-ohki meowing
frantically as the house caught fire.  And all Ryoko would say was, "Leave
me
alone, I'm trying to sleep
here."
He was very surprised when he turned aroud to find Ryoko there, her hand up
ready to tap him on the shoulder, she looked as surprised as he was.

"Ummm, she struggled to find words, "oh, I brought you some lunch, I thought
you would be hungry."

"Ya know what, I think I'll go back to the house and fix myself something to
eat."

"Oh come on!  It's not THAT bad, I liked it."  Ryoko protested, shoving the
container of food into Tenchi's arms.  "Just try it!"

Tenchi tested her,"And what if I don't?"  Tenchi saw a fire in Ryoko's eye
light up.

"Well, let's see, if you like it, you have to do ALL the house chores for
the
time.  If you don't, I'll take up your chores here in the fields plus the
house ones."

"Deal"  Tenchi grinned.

Tenchi took a bite of the food.  He chewed thoughtfully, teasing Ryoko.  She
meerly slumped down sitting as a cat would on a rather large bolder near the
side of the field, waiting.
Tenchi turned around and face the fact that this was good, when he saw her,
looking like a cat, ready to pounce at the slightest movement.  A breeze
stirred up and she looked from
watching Tenchi and stared intently at a little mass moving across the
field.
 For a minute, Tenchi thought she was going to pounce, and he just stared at
her.  Without Tenchi noticing,
Ryoko gave a sidewards glance at him.  "Well, what do you think?"

This brought Tenchi to attention, turning red from getting caught staring.
"Well, it looks like I'd better get finished with the fields so I can get
the
house chores done."  Tenchi
smiled at Ryoko's surprised look.  "I'll be home soon."

Ryoko grinned slyly, and with that, she disappeared.
Back at the house, she sat bored stiff on the coach, "Sooooo bored, nothing
to do."  She said to herself.  At this point, Ryoko wondered why Washu had
not entered her thoughts.  She decided
to look in on her mother.

*Mom* Ryoko said telepathically, *what are you doing, don't you want any
lunch?*

An annoyed answer came back to her, *No, now who's intruding?  Anyway, I
have
an important experiment and you just distracted me.*

*Sorrrrry, I am just bored and concerned, you haven't butted in on my
thoughts in a while.*

*You're blocking me that's why, now, may I get back to my work, clean the
house if you are bored.*

*Blocking you, how, i can't even feel it.*

*This may alarm you for a minute or two but I don't know.  If you let me get
some time to myself, maybe I'll be able to find that answer.*

*Fine, be that way.*

And with that, the conversation was over.  Ryoko decided about five minutes
later to take her mother's advice and clean the house completely forgetting
the bet with Tenchi.

******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************

****************
Back at the carrot fields, Tenchi couldn't that picture out of his mind,
Ryoko perched there, looking like a proper cat.  A rather cute one too, wait
a minute, did he actually think that?
No, couldn't be.  Tenchi tried to brush it out of his mind, but somehow, it
came back to him.  He still had a little of lunch left over, so he walked
over to were Ryoko once sat and finished
eating.

Soon after, he arrived home, ready to start on the chores.  When he walked
inside, he almost fainted, the house was spotless.  He walked into the
kitchen to find no dishes, everything cleaned,
it was strange.  He walked out to the living room and found Ryoko asleep on
the coach.  Tenchi walked over to her and brushed a stray hair from her
face,
she was cute when she slept, so at
peace.  Hard to believe she was such a nightmare when she was awake.
Ryoko moved her legs closer to her body, balling up like a cat, and leaving
a
place for Tenchi to sit on the coach.  He almost took the offer but then
realized that he was completely soiled.
Tenchi decided to go take a bath.  This was nice, Tenchi thought, no crazed
Ryoko after him, but this was strange as well, she was acting differently on
top of the pact.  Something seemed wrong
with her, he wanted to know, mostly so she knew she had a shoulder to cry
on.
 Tenchi thought about the last comment his mind made.  Was he really?  No,
it
couln't be, no, he tried to deny it but
somewhere in his mind, he knew he was falling for Ryoko.
As Tenchi was getting out of the bath and getting dressed, he heard a cry
from downstairs.  He threw the rest of his clothes on and raced downstairs,
the one thing he wished he wouldn't see was there,
a shadow figure, barely able to make out but there, standing over Ryoko who
seemed still asleep on the couch.
She was sobbing uncontrollably.  The shadow came closer, wispering one thing
Tenchi could barely hear, "Happy Aniversary my little pet."

Tenchi ran down the stairs and to Ryoko's side, before he could make it
though, the shadow wiped his hand across Ryoko's face, she screamed in pain.
Ryoko was now wide awake, blood from countless cuts
on her face ran down it.  She was sobbing loudly.  Tenchi couldn't take it
anymore, he ran to the shadow, the Tenchi-chan in hand ready to strike.
Before he got the opportunity, though, the shadow
disappeared.  Tenchi sat by her side, embracing her, trying to get her to
calm down, eventually, the slashes on her face healed.  Ryoko broke the
embrace, tears still flooding down her face, Tenchi ran
to the kitchen and grabbed a cloth to wipe the tears and blood from her
face,
he turned around and almost ran into Ryoko.  She stood there trying
desperately to stop crying.

"I'm sorry"  she tried to say through sobs.

"What for, none of this is your fault."  Tenchi said soothingly, wiping the
warm cloth across her face.

"I can't believe I am crying like a baby."  Ryoko was trying her best to
think tough, but when she thought of the shadow standing over her, letting
all the abuse she once suffered come back, she broke down.
She cried into Tenchi's shirt.  "I've even broke Ayeka's pact."

"Shhh, it's ok, hush now, it's over.  The bad dreams over."  Tenchi
comforted
her, running his hand up and down her arm.

"But it's not over Tenchi, there's still more.  Washu had been wondering why
I was so distant.  It's my 'anniversary'."

Tenchi pulled Ryoko from him, "You don't have to live with it, let it go.
It's ok now."  Tenchi wiped tears from her eyes.

"Tenchi, I have something to tell you.  Tenchi, you may be sick of hearing
this but you have to know how much I mean this, Tenchi, I love you.  And I
thank you for what you have done for me today, it makes
me feel so much better." Ryoko had stopped crying and she smiled weakly.

"I will never get sick of hearing it from my love."  Ryoko was taken
completely aback.  She didn't know what to say.
This comment relieved Tenchi of something, something big.  He felt relaxed.
Not giving Ryoko the chance to say anything, he leaned over and kissed her.
Tenchi could feel her gems getting warm.

Ryoko was completely surprised, she had never expected this to happen.  She
stiffened, but, then started to relax and return the kiss.  For a while,
they
just stood there, Ryoko was no longer crying, the awful
dream completely forgotten.  This was her anniversary, the anniversary of
her
love.  She had never felt so happy, so relaxed, so unbelievably at peace
with
everything.

When this kiss was broken, Tenchi smiled at the dreamy look in Ryoko's eyes.
'Those eyes,' he thought, 'I've never seen anything like them.'  Tenchi
found
himself staring into them, when he realized what he was
doing, he blushed again, 'Why was he staring?'  To evade Ryoko from getting
upset, he looked around at the still clean kitchen.   "I love what you've
done with the house."

Ryoko blushed, "Well thank you, considering they were your chores!"

"Well you did them."

"Only cause I was bored."  Ryoko protested.

"That's not my fault."  Tenchi argued back.

Ryoko opened her mouth to say something more but it was drown out by another
kiss from Tenchi.

Without anyone noticing, the phone began to ring.  An irratated Washu
emerged
from her lab with Ryo-ohki at her heels.
"Doesn't anyone around here know how to answer the phone?"  She picked it up
and responded "yes"  then called out for Tenchi.

"Tenchi, if you're in there," Washu directed her call to the kitchen, "it's
for you."

She waited a few minutes and Tenchi walked out followed by Ryoko, who was
positively glowing.  Washu once again tried to enter her thoughts to find
out
why, but yet again, Ryoko seemed to be blocking her without
knowing how, or that she was doing it.  'Oh well'  Washu shrugged it off,
she
figured, if it was important, she would soon hear about it.
Washu walked back into the recesses of her lab.

"That was grandfather, it seems that he wants to train today, even after he
said I could have a break."

"Good, that gives opportunity for me to make dinner.  Now go."  Ryoko shued
Tenchi out of the door.

After closing the door, Ryoko smiled to herself, but then frowned, 'what
would Ayeka think?  Did she really break the pact?  I mean she didn't mean
that she couln't actally "touch" Tenchi, just not approach him
in that way.  But then, what of the kiss?'
Ryoko decided to push these thoughts from her mind and concentrate on
something, it was too early for dinner, so, she slumped on the coach and
tried to find a good soap opera on tv.

******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************

*************************

Tenchi got home late, he thought dinner would be cold by the time he walked
in.  However, the minute he walked through the front door, he smelled he
sweet aroma of food.  If was delicious, for a moment, he thought
Sasami had come home early.

"Yum, something smells good!"  Tenchi stated

"Well, I certainly hope you are hungry!"  Ryoko shouted from the kitchen.\
Tenchi walked in to a table full of food and only two places.

"Who's eating tonight?"

"Just us, Washu's taking her meals in her lab unless she says otherwise,
your
grandfather's not here, and Nobuyuki called and said he was staying late at
the office, just us tonight.  Why, something wrong?"

"Nothing at all." Tenchi said with a smile on his face.  He had grown fond
of
Ryoko as of late.  Maybe it was because everyone else was gone that his
emotions were able to expand.  'Something like that he thought.'

Tenchi looked lovingly at Ryoko, his Ryoko.  He came up behind her and
kissed
her on the cheek.  Ryoko turned around, a little startled, then, ushured him
to sit and eat.

Dinner was actually eaten in silence, then the couple sat on the coach,
watching a show on tv.  Ryoko's head lay in Tenchi's lap, it wasn't long
after that Tenchi had found that Ryoko had fallen asleep.

Tenchi carried her up to his room, laid her on his bed, then crawled in
himself.  For a while, he just sat, watching the moonlight stream in on
Ryoko's features.  'How beautiful.' He thought.  Then, with that, Tenchi
himself fell asleep.
