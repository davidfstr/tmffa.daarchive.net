Jurai's Debt
Part 2

Wedding Bells

        According to Einstein nothing can travel faster than light.
        had Crlck'gnq, father-chief of the Grrrllcck cruiser
Hold-fast-seek-far, ever heard of Einstein, he would have
undoubtedly have found his theories amusing. He might even have
laughed, a sound something like a cat being put tail-first into a
blender. However, Crlck'gnq had never heard of Einstein, and
never would. His ship was cruising along at approximately 80
times the speed of light and so far was having no problems.
        Crlck'gnq headed down the corridor towards his private
nest intent on some personal recreation time after nineteen
standard cycles of work. His snail-like lower half left a slimy trail
along the damp floor, his tentacles trailed along beside him, and
his twelve eyes gave him a complete view of his surroundings.
Overall, to a Human, Crlck'gnq  would have resembled a plastic
octopus with a suction cup base.
        Crlck'gnq's thoughts were of consuming sweet leaves and
perusing his latest message from home. He was fortunate that his
death came quickly. The section of hull nearest to him vanishing in
a spectacular display of light followed by the cold vacuum of
space, sucking him out.

        The raider vessel appeared out of nowhere, no warning was
given by any of the ships sensors, until too late. The small, fast
ship blasted the moorings holding the cargo containers to the hull.
The cargo containers, now free, continued on at their present
speed, pushed off course by the explosive force of their separation.
The raider ship then proceeded to perforate the hull killing the
livving vessel and it’s crew. Farther ahead another raider ship
appeared and collected the cargo containers. The two ships, and
their stolen prize, again vanished into the inky blackness of space.

        Oblivious to the demise of  Crlck'gnq and his crew, Tenchi
came down the hill from the Misaki shrine. His mind reeling, in
five days he would be leaving for Jurai. He walked slowly to
consider that. As he reached the landing, a strange feeling washed
over him. Tenchi stopped, stood still for a moment, then spoke,
"What was the deal?"
        Sitting on the stairs, and wearing a dress and hat much like
Myuka's, Tsunami smiled.  "You sensed me?"
        Tenchi turned to face her. "Every day I can feel more of it.
How much is there?"
        "If you are referring to the aura of god, what some call the
light hawk energy, it is beyond measuring. The word 'infinite' does
not even come close."
        "What was the deal?"
        "In eight million years I have kept it to myself, why should
I tell you?"
        "Why should I go to Jurai? The emperor doesn't want me
there. I don't really want to go."
        "Are we negotiating?" Tsunami smiled, a smile that could
melt a glacier.
        "Two years on Jurai. Then what? I come home, go to
college, get a job? How could I  do that after seeing what's beyond
this world.... You can't go home again."
        Tsunami stood and approached Tenchi. "I need a
champion, a knight. Of all the creatures, in a thousand Galaxies, I
chose you. When you awakened the Light Hawk wings inside you
you ceased being Human. You are a species all your own, and you
have responsibilities. Leave your nest, go to Jurai,... it is the first
step on a long road that you and I will travel together.... This world
cannot contain you."
        Tenchi looked into Tsunami's eyes. "I... I'm scared."
        "The future frightens all of us Tenchi.... Close your eyes."
        Tenchi obeyed. Tsunami leaned forward and touched her
forehead to Tenchi's. The 'mark of true power' glowed on both
foreheads. Tenchi's feelings of fear and inadequacy melted away
under the resonance of their power. Tenchi realized that he was
capable of dealing with whatever the universe threw his way.
        When Tenchi opened his eyes Tsunami was gone.

Ten hours later and half a galaxy away.

        "EMPEROR OF JURAI!"
        Azusa bolted up. Misaki rolled over and covered her head
with a pillow. At the foot of the bed stood Tsunami in all her glory.
The lights were dimmed in the room but Tsunami was casting off
enough illumination to read by.
        Azusa fumed. "What do you want?"
        "Tenchi is coming here in five days."
        If you were in the room to see Azusa you might think that
any moment steam would begin pouring out his ears. "Over my
dead body!"
        "If necessary."
        Azusa stood.
        Tsunami turned her head. "At least put some clothes on!"
        Azusa picked up his robe from where it was laying at the
foot of his bed and covered himself. He walked over to where
Tsunami appeared to be standing. "I will not allow that... that..
BASTARD... To take my throne, I don't care how powerful he is. I
will not allow it."
        Tsunami smiled. The smile of a cat about to pounce on an
unsuspecting mouse. "Tenchi is coming, he will be the next
emperor, or there will be no more empire. I will take back all that I
have given."
        Azusa clenched his fists, his knuckles whitening.
        Tsunami continued. "Tenchi is still young, he had much
growing to do both physically and in power, you still have time to
mold him into the heir you want. However, one way or another,
Tenchi will be the next emperor." With that final statement,
Tsunami vanished.
        Azusa sat down on the edge of the bed. "We'll see about
that!"
        Misaki hit him with a pillow.

Earth: four days later.

        Tenchi was sorting through his closet, deciding what to
take and what to leave. Ayeka had Promised him that he would
receive a full wardrobe of Juraian clothing when they arrived. But
Tenchi was human, and not completely comfortable with way he
had seen Juraian's dressed so far.
        So, he was folding and packing the bulk of his wardrobe
for tomorrow's trip.
        "Can I come in?"
        Tenchi looked up to find Kiyone standing in the doorway
        "Sure come on in."
        Kiyone walked into Tenchi's room, carefully avoiding the
stacks of  clothing and boxes of stuff he was packing, she sat down
on the edge of his bed near to him. "Are you going to have room
for everything in there?" She gestured to the footlocker he was
stacking clothes in.
        "Washuu gave it to me, it's allot bigger on the inside than
on the out."
        Kiyone nodded with understanding. "Tenchi there's
something I wanted to talk to you about for a while now...."
        "Have you seen this?" Tenchi interrupted Kiyone. He
picked up a bundle of cloth off of his desk and unfurled it. The
cloth proved to be a Juraian garment, Tenchi held it against
himself and showed it to Kiyone.
        "It's very nice, Tenchi. Anyway your father and I have been
seeing alot of each other lately..."
        Tenchi appeared not to hear Kiyone's words. "Ayeka gave
this to me for when we arrive on Jurai. I'm just not sure."
        Kiyone took a deep breath.
"TenchiyourfatherandIaregettingmarried."
        Tenchi stopped. "Say that again."
        "Your father asked me to marry him and I said yes."
        Tenchi froze, holding absolutely still, staring at Kiyone.
After about a minute he started to giggle, then laugh out loud.
        Kiyone glared at Tenchi, who was all but rolling on the
floor.
        Finally Tenchi stopped. "Boy, Kiyone, you had me going
there for a minute, you must be taking lessons from Washuu."
        "Tenchi, I'm serious. Since you’re leaving Tomorrow your
grandfather is going to marry us later this afternoon at the shrine."
        Tenchi sat down. "How the heck did this happen?"
        Kiyone moved to kneel in front of Tenchi. "Tenchi, I want
you to know I'm not trying to replace your mother...."
        "That's not what I mean, how do you and my dad get
together without anyone noticing?"
        Kiyone grinned. "Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, Washuu, and
Sasami. You don't have to be a tactician to use them as cover fire.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've been able to sneak
out without anyone but Washuu knowing."
        A loud screeching sound outside drew there attention. It
was a familiar sound, the one made by a GP patrol ship entering
the atmosphere way too fast to land properly, usually the sound
heralded the arrival of Mihoshi. But Mihoshi was downstairs.
        Tenchi and Kiyone looked out the window for the
offending ship.  A forcefield, courtesy of Washuu, guaranteed the
house would survive the impact. No such guarantee was made to
the person piloting said ship.
        The ship was defiantly not GP. The ships hull was bright
red, either from  paint or, if the hull coating was cheap, the heat of
reentry (or entry, when referring to ships from other worlds).
        At what appeared to be the very last second the ship spun
its nose towards the lake, pulled up, and fired it's propulsion
thrusters. The ship came to rest gracefully in the pond next to the
dock. Not one drop of pond water was disturbed.
        The ship was most defiantly red, not quite as big as
Mihoshi's shuttle. It looked like  the space ship version of a hot
rod.
        "Oh no, not her."
        Tenchi looked at Kiyone. "Who is it?"
         Without replying Kiyone hurriedly left the room. Tenchi
followed.

        Down by the pier Ayeka and Ryoko stood watching the
ship. Just as Tenchi and Kiyone arrived the hatch opened and,
somewhat wobbly, out stepped a young man with blond hair and
dark skin. His skin seemed to have a greenish tint to it and he was
covering his mouth with his hand.
        Before anyone could say anything the boy dashed to the
back of the water-bound shuttle and was violently sick.
        After a minute he came back around to the front, looking
noticeably less green. "Great landing, mom." He called sarcasticly
into the ship.
        An older woman with shoulder length blond hair and the
same dark skin exited the shuttle. "Oh, it wasn't that bad. Any
landing you can walk away from is a good one, and nobody told
me this planet didn't have a landing beacon."
        The woman removed her sunglasses and perched them on
her head, then she scanned the crowd until her eyes set upon
Kiyone. Instantly, she grabbed Kiyone into a chest-crushing,
Misaki-taking-notes hug. "Kiyone! It's so good to see you again!"
        "Hi, Mrs Kuramitsu." Kiyone managed to choke out the
words.
        Ayeka spoke up. "Kuramitsu?"
        Mihoshi, having finally woken up form her midmorning
nap (1 of 5, collect them all!), stepped onto the porch to see what
was happening. "Mommy!"
        Mihoshi ran up to the new arrivals.
        Mihoshi's mom released her death-grip on Kiyone and
hugged Mihoshi. The two started babling in their native language.
        Tenchi turned to Kiyone. "What's going on?"
        Kiyone shrugged her shoulders. "Let’s wait and see."

        An hour later, the whole family was assembled in the living
room and sipping tea.
        "So you’re Mihoshi's mom?"
        Mrs. Kuramitsu nodded at Sasami. "Please, just call me
Lena."
        "So what brings you here?" Ayeka said.
        "I got a message from the Juraian royal court suggesting I
stop by today, it didn't say why. Don't you know?"
        Ayeka shook her head no. "No one here sent any messges."
        "I sent the message."
        Everyone turned to see Funaho and Misaski standing in the
doorway.
        Sasmi hopped up and ran to her mother, who she hadn't
seen in six months. "Mommy!"
        While Misaki and Sasami said hello, Funaho approached
the group. Tenchi stood and welcomed her.
        "Did, you come to pick us up?"
        "Yes, also there's some business we need to take care of
with my son."
        "I just came for the wedding." Misaki piped up.
        "Oh, you came for dad's wedding?"
        "Your dad's getting married? To who?"
        "Uh, that would be me." Kiyone raised her hand. Every
other female in the room except Washuu stared at Kiyone.
        "Wait a minute," Tenchi piped up, "if you're not here for
dads wedding, who's are you here for?"
        Misaki grinned at Tenchi. "Yours, of course!"
