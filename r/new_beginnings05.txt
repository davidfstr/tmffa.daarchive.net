Grandfather and Kazuhiko carry Tenchi between them.  Mihoshi walks behind.

KAZUHIKO
We are going to need water soon.

GRANDFATHER
Mihoshi do you know where the nearest settlement is?

Mihoshi walks on silently.

GRANDFATHER
Let's stop here.

Grandfather and Kazuhiko set Tenchi on the ground.

Mihoshi walks past a few feet and then stops staring out over the plain.

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi.  Tenchi.

KAZUHIKO
He's in shock and so is she.

Grandfather slaps Tenchi across the face.  He does it again.

Before he can strike a third time Mihoshi grabs his arm.

MIHOSHI
Why are you doing that?

GRANDFATHER
I am trying to wake him up.

MIHOSHI
He needs medical help.

She pulls out her cube, and does a series of twists.

Out pops a small ground car.

The ground car looks like a bug.  It has an open roof and no glass except
the windshield.

Mihoshi spins around looking at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
Okay let's go.  There is a settlement over 
that way about ten miles.
 
Grandfather puts Tenchi in back and sits next to him.  Kazuhiko sits up
front with Mihoshi.

The car takes off across the desert.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Shihou leads his men across the desert.

They stop at Yukinojo's wreckage.

This is the remains of the police ship.

SHIHOU
Spread the men and look for signs of survivors.

The men spread out and cover the area.

SOLDIER
Sir there is tracks over here.

Shihou and Toku approach the soldier.

SHIHOU
Four of them.  Two are dragging one and a fourth walking behind.  Gather
them up Toku.  We will follow the tracks.

Yes my Lord.

What is that for?

MIHOSHI
Can you use it?

MIHOSHI
Then it is for you.  Where's Tenchi?

GRANDFATHER
Room twelve.

Mihoshi exits the waiting room.

GRANDFATHER
Can you really use that?

KAZUHIKO
My father trained me.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, Daijiro, and Ryoe sit on the desert floor.

RYOKO
Well, let me take a quick look around.

Ryoko flies straight up in the air.

RYOE
How do you think the others are doing?

AYEKA
I am not sure.  I know that Lord Tenchi is okay.

DAIJIRO
Are you certain?

AYEKA
Yes, I would feel it in my soul if it were otherwise.
 
Ryoko teleports back with the group.

RYOKO
There is a small village about ten miles that way.  They may have a
communications center.

AYEKA
Well let's get going then.

The four stand and start to walk off.

RYOE
Aren't you worried about finding Ryo-Ohki again?

RYOKO
No.  Now that I have been here I can always teleport back.  Besides
Ryo-Ohki will call to me when she is ready.

The four move out into the desert.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Shihou and Toku with four men standing guard.

TOKU
Scouts report a village just ahead.

SHIHOU
Did our prey enter the village?

Yes my Lord.

SHIHOU
Destroy the village and flush them out.  Ryoko destroyed this village
like so many other things.

TOKU
As you command my Lord.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Four men gather around Toku.

TOKU
Lieutenant, take your men to that bluff.  Hit the communications building
at the first signal, and then the power generator.  Take out any organized
resistance after that.

LIEUTENANT
Yes sir.

The Lieutenant leaves the scene at a run.

TOKU
Divide the parameter into three sections.  Ensure no one leaves the
village.  Signal me when your men are in place.

All three salute and depart.

Tenchi's dream.

Ryoko and Grandfather stand in front of the temple.

Grandfather holds a red haired baby.

RYOKO
Are you proud of your great granddaughter?

GRANDFATHER
Very proud.

Ryoko laughs watching Grandfather with the baby.

RYOKO
There is a lot of her grandmother in her, but I think there is a little
of you in her too.

GRANDFATHER
More likely it is her father, Tenchi, we see in her.

Ryoko's face saddens at the memory of Tenchi.

RYOKO
Yes I wish he could be here now.

GRANDFATHER
He will always be in our hearts.

TENCHI (O. C.)
I can be there. Why am I not there?

Tenchi's dream.

Father and Grandfather sit in the temple study.

A young Tenchi is coloring.

FATHER
He looks just like you dad.

GRANDFATHER
I think there is more of his mother in him.

Father's eyes mist over.

FATHER
Yes, he does so remind me of her.  I wish she could be here to enjoy
these days.

GRANDFATHER
She will always be in our hearts.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Mother?  Where did you go mother?

Are you proud of your great granddaughter?

GRANDFATHER
Very proud.

Ryoko laughs watching Grandfather with the baby.

RYOKO
There is a lot of her grandmother in her, but I think there is a little
of you in her too.

GRANDFATHER
More likely it is her father, Tenchi, we see in her.

Ryoko's face saddens at the memory of Tenchi.

Yes I wish he could be here now.

GRANDFATHER
He will always be in our hearts.

TENCHI (O. C.)
No!  No, I am still alive!

Mihoshi is sleeping against the bed holding Tenchi's left hand.

Tenchi rolls on his side and cups Mihoshi's face in his right hand.

Mihoshi opens her eyes.

TENCHI
Thank you Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Oh.  It was Grandfather and Kazuhiko that carried you in.

TENCHI
Thank you Mihoshi.

Mihoshi smiles.

The rumble of a distant explosion is heard.

Tenchi jumps out of bed leaving he scene.

MIHOSHI
Wait Tenchi!

INT Close up of Tenchi - DAY

See Tenchi, from behind, wearing no clothes.

Tenchi covers himself and turns around.

TENCHI (O. C.)
Let's get going.

Okay.

Mihoshi stands and leaves.

EXT. Deep space - DAY

Galaxy Police Cruiser Yagami.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Kiyone sits at her command chair.

KIYONE
That concludes my report on the Telxson drug ring.  Please transmit
that Yagami.

YAGAMI
Done Lieutenant Kiyone.

KIYONE
That was a classic waste of Galaxy Police time and money.  A drug ring
that smuggles aphrodisiacs.

YAGAMI
I have received two distress signals from the KAL system.  Both were cut
off within a minute of each other.

KIYONE
The KAL system.  That's only one day away.  Who sent them?

YAGAMI
One was from the police sub-station and the other from the Yukinojo.

Kiyone's face falls.

She drops her head in her hands.

KIYONE
Not the Yukinojo.  Will I ever be rid of that woman?

YAGAMI
Your orders.

KIYONE
Send a report to Headquarters that we are investigating.  Make top speed
to the KAL system Yagami.

YAGAMI
Yes Lieutenant.

Kiyone shakes her head.

KIYONE
Why me, oh God, why me.

INT. Hospital waiting room - DAY

Grandfather sits cross-legged on the couch in meditation.

Kazuhiko is lying asleep on another couch with a rifle in his arms.

Mihoshi and Tenchi enter the waiting room.

GRANDFATHER
Feeling better I see.

The sound of another explosion is heard.

TENCHI
I think it is time to leave.

GRANDFATHER
Yes, are you up to it?

TENCHI
What have you told me before Grandfather?  We can mourn our dead later,
but now we must save the living.

Tenchi shakes Kazuhiko awake.

TENCHI
Let's go.

The four exit the waiting room.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Shihou stands with his four guards.

Shihou's communicator beeps.

TOKU (O. C.)
The communications building and power plant have been destroyed.

SHIHOU
Any sign of our prey or the Light Hawk Wings?

TOKU
No sir.

SHIHOU
Have the heavy weapons destroy the larger buildings.  I don't want to
go in after them.

TOKU
Sir, our ammunition is limited.

SHIHOU
Carry out your orders.

TOKU
Yes Lord Shihou, consider it done.

EXT. Looking over Shihou at the village - DAY

Shells start falling on the larger structures.

SHIHOU
Come on out into the open.  You are to soft hearted to let these
people suffer.

EXT. Desert Planet - DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryoe, and Daijiro are walking.

EXT. Desert planet horizon - DAY

Smoke is rising from the ground on the horizon with the cause out of view.

DAIJIRO (O. C.)
What is that?

EXT. Desert planet - DAY
 
Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryoe, and Daijiro stand looking at each other.

RYOKO
It is in the direction of the village.

AYEKA
Shihou must be attacking it.

RYOKO
That means the others are still alive.  I am going to scout ahead.  You
three need to hurry as fast as you can.

AYEKA
Be careful Ryoko.  We need you with us when the fighting starts.

RYOKO
I will Ayeka.

Ryoko flies off toward the village.

Daijiro leads off in a trot.

DAIJIRO
Let's see if a year of sports has kept you two in shape.

RYOE
You're on Daijiro.
 
Ayeka falls in with the other two.

EXT. Village street with hospital in the background - DAY

Tenchi, Mihoshi, Grandfather, and Kazuhiko run out of the hospital.

MIHOSHI
My car is right over there.

The hospital explodes throwing the four to the ground.

Tenchi flips over on his back.

TENCHI
They blew up the hospital.

The others stand, and Grandfather dusts himself off.

GRANDFATHER
It is the Jurai way.  The end justifies the means.

		TENCHI
Do you believe that Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
I did in my arrogant youth, but time has a way of changing things.

Tenchi frowns.

TENCHI
A friend told me that fairness is only for the very strong.

GRANDFATHER
That may be so but even the weakest can do the right thing.

Another explosion rocks the village.

KAZUHIKO
Let's get out of here before it becomes a moot point.

MIHOSHI
Hurry the car isn't damaged.

All four run over to the car.

MIHOSHI
I have another rifle.

Grandfather makes no move to take it.

Tenchi grabs the rifle from Mihoshi.

GRANDFATHER
You do not know how to use that.

KAZUHIKO
That's okay I do.  Just point and squeeze the trigger Tenchi.  If you do
it enough they will stay down and they won't shoot back.

Tenchi and Kazuhiko get in the back and stand looking though the open roof.

Mihoshi and Grandfather sit in front.

Mihoshi starts the car and drives off.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

EXT. Desert planet with village in background - DAY

Shihou and Toku stand with four guards.

Toku's communicator beeps.

SERGEANT (O. C.)
This is third squad.  I have a ground car leaving the village toward
my position.

SHIHOU
Destroy it.

TOKU
Take out the ground car.

SERGEANT (O. C.)
Yes sir.

TOKU
What if it's our target?

SHIHOU
Then third squad will probably die.

TOKU
If they get past them they will go into those southern mountains.

SHIHOU
Then that is where we will trap them.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Ryoko is flying low over the desert floor.

EXT. Looking in front of Ryoko - DAY

The village is burning in numerous places.

A ground car moves to the south away from the city.

A squad of three soldiers waits in ambush behind a ridge.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Ryoko is flying low over the desert floor.

Ryoko turns in the direction of the soldiers.

RYOKO
Those defiantly look like the bad guys.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

View the backs of three soldiers at medium distance.

Ryoko enters the scene at a close distance.  At the same time the ground
car enters the scene at a far distance.

Ryoko fires an energy ball at the soldiers.

All three start shooting back at her.

Fire comes from the ground car in the direction of the soldiers.

RYOKO
Time to go.

Ryoko disappears.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

The ground car is moving at top speed near ninety miles per hour.

Mihoshi is focused on her driving with a big grin on her face.

Tenchi and Kazuhiko are shooting at the soldiers.

TENCHI
I am sure that was Ryoko I saw.

KAZUHIKO
Well who ever she was, she spoiled that ambush.

Laser shots fly past the car.

TENCHI
I thought you said they wouldn't shoot back.

KAZUHIKO
Fire faster.

The car speeds on placing a ridge between them and the soldiers.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Shihou and Toku stand with four guards.

Toku's communicator beeps.

SERGEANT (O. C.)
This is third squad.  The ground car has made it past our position and 
is moving into the pass directly south of the village.  An airborne unit
attacked us, Sir.

SHIHOU
That would be Ryoko.

TOKU
Your orders sir?

SHIHOU
Break off attack on the village and regroup the men.  We must trap them
before they find a way out of the mountains.

Toku begins giving orders on his communicator.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Ryoko teleports into the scene.

She looks around and starts flying toward the village.

EXT. Desert planet looking to Ryoko's front - DAY

Ayeka, Daijiro, and Ryoe are trotting toward the village.

RYOKO
Wait up!

The three come to a stop and turn around.

Ryoko flies to catch up with them.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

All four stand together.

Ryoe and Daijiro are breathing heavily.

RYOKO
There are soldiers up ahead.  I saw a ground car escape the city with
four on board.  A blond was driving.

RYOE
That must have been Mihoshi.

DAIJIRO
Only four?

RYOKO
That was all I saw.

AYEKA
Maybe the other two were left in the city.

RYOKO
I don't know.  I still can't sense Washu.

DAIJIRO
Now what?

AYEKA
It will be getting dark soon.  We can make it to those foothills 
before dark.

RYOKO
If Tenchi is in a car they will gain too much ground on us.

AYEKA
Even Mihoshi can't drive in the mountains in the dark.

DAIJIRO
I have not seen any roads around here.  They will probably have to
abandon the car anyway.

RYOKO
Fine, let's get as far as we can.  That Shihou has a lot of firepower
on his side.

The four start running for the foothills.

EXT. Desert planet canyon - NIGHT

The car bounces along at a high rate of speed.

TENCHI
Mihoshi can you see where you are going.

MIHOSHI
Well kind of.

TENCHI
Kind of?  Why are we still driving?

MIHOSHI
Because nothing...
 
The car screeches to a halt.

You can barely make out a ravine in the dark.

MIHOSHI
Hmmm.  I don't think I can drive over that.

TENCHI
I think I am going to be sick.

GRANDFATHER
We must find a place for the night away from here.

Everyone gets out of the car.

Mihoshi twists her cube and the car disappears.

TENCHI
Which way?

KAZUHIKO
That spot up the canyon wall looks like a good place.  We will be able
to see anyone that comes up the canyon.

TENCHI
Do you have something that flies in the cube Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
No I always had Yukinojo.

Tenchi takes Mihoshi's hand.

TENCHI
Lead on Kazuhiko.

The four make their way up the canyon wall.

EXT. Desert planet canyon entrance - NIGHT

Shihou and his men enter the canyon.

TOKU
It is getting too dark to move safely my Lord.  There is a good chance
we could walk into an ambush.

SHIHOU
Send scouts ahead while we make camp here.

TOKU
As you command my Lord.

Toku moves over and confers with some of the men.

Four soldiers continue on into the canyon while the others set up camp.

EXT. Shihou's camp - NIGHT

The men sit at their meals.

EXT. Close up of Shihou and Toku - NIGHT

Both men sit eating.

The distant sound of shots is heard followed by the rumble of an explosion.

SHIHOU
Our scouts must have found something.

Both men wait.

EXT. Canyon ledge - NIGHT

Tenchi, Grandfather, and Mihoshi sit to eat cold rations.

Kazuhiko eats his meal while watching over the canyon entrance.

KAZUHIKO
I have always wanted to be a professional wrestler.  My dad wanted me
to carry on the tradition of military service.  All of this is making
me think my dad may be right.

TENCHI
Are you crazy?  Getting shot at is not my idea of a job.

KAZUHIKO
I can feel my blood flowing through my body when we ran through that
ambush.  I have never felt so alive.

GRANDFATHER
The warrior's blood flows through few these days.  We must make the most
of our few talents.

TENCHI
Well I don't like fighting or killing.

GRANDFATHER
Then why do you practice your sword work with me?

TENCHI
Ayeka asked me the same thing, and I will give you the same answer.
I don't know.

GRANDFATHER
I train you because you have the Power of Jurai.  For me to do less would
be like setting a wild lion loose on school children.

TENCHI
I don't have to like it.

KAZUHIKO
I don't like war Tenchi, but I won't refuse it either.  I can simply
accept it for what it is, a job, and not for some meaningless glory.

GRANDFATHER
Those are wise words.  You can hate killing Tenchi, but refusing to do
so when the need comes is the mistake.

TENCHI
I feel that when you kill you have missed out on a better way.

GRANDFATHER
Your mother did not feel that way about KAIN.  Is that how you felt
after Kagato?

TENCHI
How can you know what mother felt?  I was there, and I saw the evil
in KAIN.

GRANDFATHER
And?

TENCHI
Maybe you're right Grandfather.  I did what I had to with Kagato, but
even now I don't know if I did the right thing.

KAZUHIKO
If you ever do know Tenchi; then is the time to put away the sword.

TENCHI
What about you Mihoshi?  You have been very quiet during this.

MIHOSHI
To kill someone is a part of my job.  It is not the part I like to
talk about.

TENCHI
You have been very steady during all this Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Tenchi.

TENCHI
I mean you have not been like your usual self.

MIHOSHI
I know what you mean.  This is not me.  It is the mask I wear when I am
on duty.  I don't like the mask Tenchi.  I don't like this me.

TENCHI
Why do it.

MIHOSHI
You should know that Tenchi.

TENCHI
I am sorry Mihoshi.  You are right I do know why.  Please forgive me.

Mihoshi smiles and returns to eating.

The group sits quietly.

Kazuhiko motions the group to silence.

KAZUHIKO
There are two coming up the valley following the vehicle tracks.

Tenchi and Mihoshi move beside him with their weapons drawn.

MIHOSHI
It is more of those soldiers.  They are looking around where we stopped.

KAZUHIKO
It looks like they found our tracks.

MIHOSHI
They have heavy weapons.

Mihoshi starts firing her blaster.

Tenchi and Kazuhiko join her with rifle fire.

An explosive round lands far below them.

MIHOSHI
Stop firing.

Tenchi and Kazuhiko obey.

TENCHI
I don't see anything.

KAZUHIKO
Those two won't be reporting back.

Tenchi looks ill.

MIHOSHI
There were others watching them, and the noise will have alerted the rest.

TENCHI
Now what?

KAZUHIKO
This is still a good spot so we may as well stay here for the night.
I will stay on watch.

Tenchi and Mihoshi move and sit with Grandfather in silence.

EXT. Desert planet - NIGHT

Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryoe, and Daijiro sit close to together in the dark.

Ryoko's stomach growls loudly.

DAIJIRO
I'm hungry to.

RYOE
I'm cold.

DAIJIRO
I can fix that.

Daijiro gathers Ryoe in his lap and wraps his arms around her.

RYOE
I'm also hungry.

AYEKA
Should we risk a fire?

The muffled sound of rifle fire and an explosion is heard.

The night returns to silence.

RYOKO
No, I don't think fire would be a good thing.  I am going into town
and get us some food and blankets.

AYEKA
Please be careful.  Those soldiers may hold the town now.

RYOKO
If I can't get a little food and a few blankets I'll retire as a
space pirate.

Ryoko flies off into the night.

EXT. Desert planet - NIGHT

Ryoe sits in Daijiro's lap.  Ayeka sits in front of him.

RYOKO (O. C.)
It's me Ryoko.  I got the stuff.

Ryoko flies into the scene.

RYOKO
All the soldiers have left the town in a hell of a mess.  I got this
stuff from a make shift hospital.  No questions asked.

Ryoko passes out the rations and blankets.

Everyone eats.

Ryoko holds up a bottle.

RYOKO
I got some of this to help warm us up.

AYEKA
Really Ryoko, I don't think that is appropriate.

RYOKO
Hey, I know when to stop.  I just seldom have a reason to.

Ryoko takes a swig and pass the bottle to Daijiro.

Both Daijiro and Ryoe take a swig.

RYOE
Kind of tastes like apple juice.

DAIJIRO
I bet that too much of this apple juice will put you on your butt.

Ayeka takes the bottle.

AYEKA
Okay, I'm not always a prude.

Ayeka takes a drink.

AYEKA
This is good.

RYOKO
I might just house break you yet.

AYEKA
What do you mean by that?

RYOKO
If we are going to share a husband you are going to need to keep up
with me.

AYEKA
Is that right Ryoko?  We will see who is chasing whom.

Ryoko laughs.

Ryoe and Daijiro join in the laughter.

AYEKA
What is so funny?

DAIJIRO
This.  Where we are and why we're here.

AYEKA
I don't see anything funny about this.

Ryoko nudges Ayeka with her elbow.

RYOKO
It's better than crying.

Ayeka's face looks blank and then she joins in the laughter.

DAIJIRO
I will take first watch.

RYOE
Is that the macho thing to do?

DAIJIRO
No.  I am not tired.  I will be happy to wake you when I get tired though.

RYOE
Fine.  I will go to sleep then.
 
Daijiro moves to the eastern edge of the hill.

Ryoko follows him.

RYOKO
Stay alert.  They are out there.

DAIJIRO
This is one job I can take seriously.

RYOKO
Good.  Wake us no matter how small the reason.  Good night Daijiro.
 
Ryoko rejoins the other girls.

RYOE
Good thing you are married or I might get jealous.

RYOKO
Do you think marriage will slow me down?

Ryoe looks up from her blankets.

Ryoko smiles back at her.

Ryoe shake her head and lays back down.

AYEKA
Good night sister.

RYOKO
Good night.

EXT. Desert planet - NIGHT

Shihou and Toku sit next to a small fire.

TOKU
Our scouts found where they went on foot.  They are about a mile up the 
canyon.

SHIHOU
And the shots.

TOKU
We lost two scouts.

SHIHOU
Does the canyon continue beyond their position?

TOKU
Yes, but I think they are staying put for the night.

SHIHOU
I still want you to slip at least two beyond them.  I do not want them
to escape me.

TOKU
They may have night vision devices.

Shihou looks at Toku.

TOKU
As you command my Lord.

SHIHOU
Move the heavy weapons to a position that can fire on them.

TOKU
Yes my Lord.

Toku leaves the fire.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY (Monday, 7 July 1997)

Ryoko moves around waking Ayeka, Ryoe, and Daijiro before sunrise.

RYOKO
Let's get closer to the action.

Ryoko pass out breakfast bars.

RYOKO
We will eat on the move.  Leave the blankets behind.

All four move out to the east.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Grandfather wakes the others before dawn.

GRANDFATHER
I believe that they have moved some people up the canyon.

KAZUHIKO
I don't think we will find a more protected spot then this.  I just
wish we had some overhead cover.

TENCHI
Activate your battle armor by twisting the bracelet.  It will protect
you against a lot of stuff.

Both Tenchi and Kazuhiko activate their armor.

KAZUHIKO
What about you two?

MIHOSHI
My uniform serves the same purpose.

Grandfather says nothing.

TENCHI
My Grandfather can teach a rock about stubbornness.
 
Kazuhiko chuckles.

TENCHI
When do you think they will attack?

KAZUHIKO
After the sun is up and in our eyes.

Grandfather nods his head.

Mihoshi plays with her police communicator.

TENCHI
What are you doing Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
I am trying to detect anyone out there.  This thing can look for body heat.

KAZUHIK
Anything?

MIHOSHI
No, not yet.

EXT. Canyon entrance - DAY

Shihou stands with Toku.

TOKU
My Lord the men are in position.  Two are south of the objective.  The
heavy weapons squad is one mile Northwest of the objective on that ridge.
We have two teams of five with us.

SHIHOU
Move our two squads to their assault position.  As soon as the sun clears
the canyon wall and illuminates the objective have the heavy weapons open
fire.  We follow ten minutes later.  The two to the far south will remain
in reserve.

TOKU
Yes Lord, consider it done.

Toku bows and moves over to the men talking on his communicator.

SHIHOU
You will not escape me Yoshou.  You will pay for protecting my
mother's killer.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Tenchi, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi lie on the ground near the edge.

Grandfather sits behind them.

TENCHI
Stay close to me.  I will try to protect us as long as I can.

Tenchi sits and puts his hands together in front of him.

Tears leak from his eyes.

GRANDFATHER
What are you doing Tenchi?

TENCHI
Little Washu said I could not generate the Light Hawk Wings.  Only the
need inside me could do that.

The three blades of the Light Hawk Wings form around Tenchi.

TENCHI
And I feel the need now.

A force field envelops the four.

KAZUHIKO
Here comes the sun.

MIHOSHI
I detect ten just north of here on the other side of that ridge.

TENCHI
You two will have to carry the fight.  I won't be able to do anything
and keep up the force field.

The first explosion hits the rocks above them showering them with debris
and shrapnel.

Everything bounces off the force field.

Tenchi winces in pain.

GRANDFATHER
You must concentrate.  Ignore the pain and concentrate.

Tenchi nods his head.

More explosions follow.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryoe, and Daijiro move low just below the ridgeline.

DAIJIRO
Look over there.  Those people are shooting at someone.

RYOKO
That makes them the bad guys in my book.  Let's take them out.

Ayeka brings up her shield to protect the group.

DAIJIRO
Let's use the blue button.

RYOE
Okay.

Ryoko sends out energy blasts.

Ryoe and Daijiro squeeze the triggers on their weapons.  It sounds like
a zipper.

Rocks explode where the bullets impact.

DAIJIRO
What kind of weapons are these.

RYOKO
They are definitely Washu's.

The area around them explodes knocking Ayeka to the ground.

AYEKA
I can't hold the shield.

Another explosion sends everyone flying.

Ryoe crawls over to Daijiro.

She rolls over his lifeless body.

RYOE
No!  You bastards will pay.

Ryoe shoulders her weapon and fires.

RYOKO
Get down Ayeka!

Ryoe fires again.

Ryoko knocks Ryoe to the ground and covers her.

A blinding white light lights up the area.

The shock wave envelops them.

Ryoko crawls off of Ryoe and Ryoe gets up on her knees.

A cloud engulfs the enemy position.

Ryoe throws away her weapon.

RYOE
What have I done?

RYOKO
This is not good.  Ayeka are you okay?

AYEKA
Yes, I think so.  Daijiro?

Ryoe breaks down crying.

Ayeka takes Ryoe by her arm.

AYEKA
We must get moving.  We are to close to the blast.

RYOE
No.  I will stay here with Daijiro.

RYOKO
Please Ryoe we must move.

Ryoe shakes her head.

AYEKA
There will be time to mourn the dead latter, now we must save the living.

Ryoe looks up and Ayeka nods her head.

RYOE
Okay, I want the rest of those bastards.

Ryoe takes Daijiro's weapon.

The three move out skirting the blast zone.

EXT. Canyon - DAY

Shihou and Toku stand together behind a large boulder.

TOKU
They have started shelling the enemy position.

SHIHOU
Excellent.  Ready the men.

A bright flash illuminates the sky to the northwest.

Everyone dives for the ground.

The blast wave passes overhead.

SHIHOU
He dares to use nuclear weapons?

TOKU
Oh my god!

SHIHOU
No, Yoshou would not, but Ryoko would.  Sound the charge before
they recover.

Toku is frozen in place.

SHIHOU
Now!

Toku moves to his feet.

TOKU
Yes Lord.

Toku and the men start over the ridge firing their weapons.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Tenchi is now lying on the ground.

The shield still covers all four.

The shelling stops followed by a bright flash to the northwest.

Tenchi drops the shield.

The blast wave, greatly reduced, passes by.

KAZUHIKO
Was that a nuke?

MIHOSHI
Oh no.  Those weapons have been outlawed throughout the galaxy.

TENCHI
Could it be Shihou?

GRANDFATHER
Even Shihou would not use nuclear weapons.

KAZUHIKO
He's going to be madder than a hornet now.

MIHOSHI
Here they come.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Kiyone sits in her command chair.

The planet is on the view screen.

YAGAMI
There is a debris field where the sub-station was located.

KIYONE
What would have destroyed the sub-station?  Any sign of Yukinojo?

YAGAMI
No Lieutenant.  I am starting a scan of the planet's surface.

Kiyone watches the view screen.

YAGAMI
Lieutenant Kiyone, I have detected a nuclear detonation on the
planet's surface.

Kiyone jumps to her feet.

KIYONE
What?  Go there now, top speed!

YAGAMI
Yes Lieutenant.

Kiyone sits back down with shock on her face.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Tenchi, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi lay low firing at the ridgeline.

The soldiers on the ridgeline are returning fire.

GRANDFATHER
Tenchi you must summon up the Light Hawk Wings again.

TENCHI
I can't Grandfather.

EXT. Canyon - DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Ryoe round the blast area and look down the valley.

AYEKA
There is Tenchi on the ledge!

RYOKO
And there are the bad guys.

Ryoe lifts her weapon only to have Ryoko lower it.

RYOKO
Not that way.

They suddenly find themselves in a shadow.

All three look up.

The Yagami sails overhead.

EXT. Ridgeline - DAY

Toku and Shihou are lying on the ground.

TOKU
Advance by squad.

SHIHOU
Bring up the reserve unit.

Toku holds up his communicator.

TOKU
Move on the objective.

A shadow falls over the group.

They look up and see the Galaxy Police cruiser.

SHIHOU
Fire on that ship!

The five blades of the Light Hawk Wings form around Shihou.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Tenchi, Mihoshi, and Kazuhiko are still firing from the ledge.

Kazuhiko slumps over.

TENCHI
Kazuhiko!

KAZUHIKO
A ricochet must have got me in the back of the shoulder.

Mihoshi hands Tenchi a bandage while she keeps up the fire.

TENCHI
Hang in there buddy.

Tenchi drags Kazuhiko back from the ledge and applies the bandage.

A shadow covers the group.

They all look up to see Yagami.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Kiyone sits in her command chair.

YAGAMI
A group on the surface is firing at us.

KIYONE
Return fire.

YAGAMI
Returning fire.  I do not understand this phenomenon.

Kiyone looks at the view screen and sees the Light Hawk Wings.

KIYONE
Maneuver quickly!

The ship rocks under impact.

YAGAMI
Propulsion is off line.

KIYONE
Emergency thrusters now!

EXT. Ridgeline - DAY

Shihou stands surrounded by the Light Hawk Wings.

The ground around Shihou erupts under the Yagami's fire.

Men are tossed in the air.

Shihou points at the ship sending one blade.

The Police Cruiser rocks under the impact and starts sinking over
the horizon.

SHIHOU
Now Yoshou it's just you and me.

Shihou starts over the ridgeline.

EXT. Canyon - DAY

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Ryoe watch the Yagami slowly go down.

Ryoko folds her hands together and the three blades of the Light Hawk
Wings form around her.

RYOKO
I am going after Shihou.  Try and reach Tenchi.

AYEKA
Let me go with you.

RYOKO
Your place is with Tenchi now.
 
Ryoko flies toward Shihou.

EXT. Canyon ledge - DAY

Tenchi is bandaging Kazuhiko while Mihoshi watches the ridge below.

MIHOSHI
Way to go Kiyone.  I can always depend on her.

Tenchi crawls over beside Mihoshi as the ground erupts around the
ridgeline.

The Light Hawk Wings form on the ridgeline and one blade heads for Yagami.

TENCHI
Damn that Shihou.

Yagami rocks under the impact.

MIHOSHI
Oh no, Kiyone!

Both watch Shihou move over the ridgeline.

Tenchi stands up and pulls out his Tree Key.

The energy blade forms.

Tenchi starts down the canyon wall.

EXT. Canyon - DAY

Shihou strides along with the Light Hawk Wing sword.

He watches Tenchi move down the canyon wall with his Tree Key sword.

SHIHOU
Come to me Tenchi.  You will die slowly by my hand.

RYOKO (O. C.)
I think not.

Shihou spins and sees Ryoko hovering in the air.

She has the Light Hawk Wing Sword in her hand, and the Light Hawk Wing
Armour and Shield protecting her.

SHIHOU
Ryoko?

RYOKO
Don't you know me?  I knew your mother...  Briefly.

SHIHOU
Die you bitch!

Shihou goes on an all out offence while Ryoko stays on the defense.

Shihou regains control of himself.

SHIHOU
You are good Ryoko.

RYOKO
I've had a lot of practice under Kagato.

Shihou again goes into a rage.

SHIHOU
Enough!

He sends a Light Hawk Wing blade against Ryoko staggering her.

Shihou thrusts his blade through her chest.

Ryoko crumbles to the ground.

Shihou looks up and sees Tenchi.

Looking at Tenchi's face Shihou takes a step back.

Tenchi forms the three blades of the Light Hawk Wings and steps over Ryoko.

The Light Hawk Wing sword replaces his Tree Key.

SHIHOU
You are no better than she is.  Did I kill your pet?

TENCHI
She was my wife.

SHIHOU
Then let me send you to her.

RYOKO
Tenchi.

Tenchi does not take his eyes off of Shihou.

TENCH
Ryoko?

Shihou takes another step back.

SHIHOU
You are still alive?

Ryoko stands up behind Tenchi and leans on him.

RYOKO
You forget that I am not quite human.

Ryoko wraps her arms around Tenchi's neck and crosses them over his chest.

She brings her legs up and wraps them around his waist.

Ryoko places her mouth near Tenchi's ear.

RYOKO
Let's show him how it's done.

Her gems begin to glow.

The Light Hawk Wing blades around Tenchi increase from three to ten.

The hilt of his Light Hawk Wing sword lengthens along with the blade
turning it into a pole arm.

RYOKO
You are Achika's son.

Ryoko is light as a feather as Tenchi moves to attack.

TENCHI
This is for Little Washu and Sasami.  There are some things that do not
deserve forgiveness.

Shihou stays on the defense while Tenchi presses his attack.

SHIHOU
Koikawa, why have you abandoned me!

Tenchi's pole arm shatters Shihou's blade.

With a quick reverse motion Tenchi separates Shihou's head from his body.

RYOKO
Say hello to my friend Yuriko in hell.

Ryoko falls off Tenchi's back onto the ground.

Tenchi spins around and kneels before her.

TENCHI
Ryoko, are you all right?

RYOKO
Hold me Tenchi.  Please hold me.

Tenchi scoops Ryoko up in his arms and looks around.

He sees Grandfather, Mihoshi, and Kazuhiko at the base of the canyon and
heads their way.

Tenchi is halfway to them when he sees Ayeka and Ryoe leaning against
each other.

Ryoe is coughing up blood.

TENCHI
Ayeka, wait there.

Tenchi trots over to Ayeka and Ryoe.

Grandfather, Mihoshi, and Kazuhiko join him there.

TENCHI
Where's Daijiro?

Ryoe breaks down crying and would fall if Ayeka didn't hold her up.

Ayeka shakes her head.

RYOE
We had so many plans, so many dreams...

She coughs up more blood.

TENCHI
The price is too high.  The lady has asked for too much.

MIHOSHI
They both have radiation-poising Tenchi.  Ryoko does too.

RYOE
My fault.  It's all my fault.

TENCHI
No Ryoe.  It is the lady who's to blame for all of this.  Shihou was
merely one of her pawns, and we were caught in her web.

AYEKA
It is too late to cast blame.  All this was set in motion so very
long ago.

TENCHI
Mihoshi the car.  We must get them to a hospital.

Mihoshi shakes her head.

MIHOSHI
Okay Tenchi.  We can try.
 
She twists her cube and the ground car appears.

Tenchi sets Ryoko in the back seat and helps Ryoe and Ayeka into the
back seat.

Tenchi sits up front with Mihoshi.

TENCHI
Grandfather we will be back for you as soon as we can.  Take care of
him Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
Of course Tenchi.  Get help for those three.

TENCHI
Drive like there is no tomorrow Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
I don't think that will be necessary Tenchi.

TENCHI
What?

Mihoshi points out the front window.

Tenchi turns to see a Galaxy Police robot land in front of the car.

TENCHI
Kiyone!

KIYONE
Right the first time.

TENCHI
I need to get these three to a hospital now.

KIYONE
You two climb on the back.

Grandfather and Kazuhiko climb onto the back bumper and hold onto the
open roof.

Kiyone picks up the ground car and takes off with her jump jets.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

EXT. Yagami - DAY

The Yagami sits on its landing legs.

KIYONE (O. C.)
Open the hatch Yagami.

The hatch opens.

Kiyone with the ground car fly into the scene.

They fly into Yagami.

The hatch closes.

INT. Yagami's cargo hold - DAY

Tenchi's house is inside the cargo hold.

Kiyone lands in front of the house and sets the car down.

KIYONE
I found some stowaways Tenchi.

Washu and Sasami walk out of the house.

TENCHI
Sasami, Little Washu you're alive!

WASHU
You hear that Sasami, we are alive.

SASAMI
Oh goody.

Tenchi breaks down crying.

TENCHI
You have to help them Little Washu.

Washu walks up to the car.

WASHU
What is it Tenchi?

Ryoko is unconscious, and Ryoe is covered in blood.

TENCHI
They are dying!

WASHU
What happened?

TENCHI
Ryoko took a sword through the chest.

WASHU
That's not to bad.

MIHOSHI
All three have severe radiation poisoning.

WASHU
That is bad.  Sasami show them to the medical lab.

SASAMI
Okay Ms. Washu.

WASHU
Where's Daijiro?

Ryoe breaks down crying.

Ayeka shakes her head.

RYOE
Can you help him Little Washu?  Please.

WASHU
There are many things I can do Ryoe, but I can't cure death.

Ryoe buries her head in Ayeka's lap.

WASHU
Tenchi take Ryoko inside.  Kazuhiko take Ryoe in.

Tenchi carries Ryoko in behind Sasami.

WASHU
What happened to you Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
It's just a minor wound.

WASHU
I will look at you later.  Tenchi will tell you I'm a great doctor.

MIHOSHI
She sure is.  It's her favorite game.

Kazuhiko picks up Ryoe and goes inside.

GRANDFATHER
I will carry Ayeka in.

WASHU
Not yet Grandfather.  Ayeka still has work to do.  You and Mihoshi go
in and prepare some tea and soup.

Grandfather nods his head and takes Mihoshi's arm.

MIHOSHI
Little Washu can you do something for me?

WASHU
What do you need Mihoshi?

Mihoshi begins to cry.

MIHOSHI
My spaceship is broke again.  Can you fix it for me?

WASHU
I will try.

MIHOSHI
Thank you.

Grandfather and Mihoshi go into the house.

WASHU
How long ago did Daijiro die?

AYEKA
No more than two hours ago.

WASHU
Did he receive the same radiation as you?

AYEKA
Yes, but he died right before that.

WASHU
As I thought.  Ryoe fired the nuke?

Ayeka nods her head.

Kiyone is still in her robot armor.

KIYONE
Those are highly illegal Washu.

WASHU
Arrest me latter.  Can you find Daijiro's body Ayeka?

AYEKA
Yes.

WASHU
Kiyone, take Ayeka and recover Daijiro's body.  And do it quickly.

KIYONE
Okay.

Kiyone picks up Ayeka.

AYEKA
What are you going to do?

WASHU
Move back time of course.

KIYONE
Open hatch.

Kiyone takes off as the hatch opens.

Washu watches the hatch close and goes into the house.

INT. Washu's lab - DAY

Tenchi holds Ryoko's hand as she is laid out on a bed.

Kazuhiko stands next to Ryoe's bed.

Washu enters the scene and moves over to her desk.

She brings up her holographic keyboard.

Some serum and syringes pop out of a hole.

TENCHI
Where's Ayeka.

WASHU
She is taking care of some business for me.

TENCHI
She has the poisoning also.

WASHU
The Jurai are a hardy breed Tenchi.  I'm not putting her in any danger.

Washu fills two syringes with the serum.

WASHU
Ryoe is in really bad shape.  This will cure the poisoning but the shock
may kill her.  It may be for the best.

TENCHI
What do you mean?

WASHU
Nothing Tenchi.  I will do my best to save her.

Washu gives Ryoe and Ryoko an injection.

WASHU
Now they need rest.  But I see you won't be leaving will you Tenchi.

TENCHI
No Little Washu.  I am staying right here.

Washu shrugs her shoulders.

WASHU
Let me see you Kazuhiko.  Sit down over there.
 
Kazuhiko sits on the chair facing the camera.

Washu takes off his bandage.

Her keyboard appears and she types some commands.

A medical kit pops out of a hole.

Washu moves behind Kazuhiko and spays his shoulder with something
from a can.

Kazuhiko visibly relaxes.

She pulls out some interments and starts working on his shoulder.

WASHU
Hold out our hand.

Kazuhiko holds his hand in front of his body.

Washu drops a bloody piece of metal into his hand.

WASHU
Here's something to remind you of today.

KAZUHIKO
It will be a souvenir for my grandchildren.

Washu takes needle and thread and works on Kazuhiko's shoulder.

WASHU
Good as new.

Grandfather enters with Daijiro's body.  Kiyone helps Ayeka into the room.

WASHU
Put Ayeka on that bed.  Grandfather, take Daijiro into the next room
please.

TENCHI
What are you doing now Washu?

Washu gives Tenchi a sad look.

WASHU
Whatever I can Lord Tenchi.

TENCHI
I'm sorry Little Washu.  I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

Grandfather exits out the far side of the lab.

Kiyone helps Ayeka onto the bed.

Washu walks over and gives her a shot.

WASHU
Thank you Kiyone.

KIYONE
We will talk later.

Kiyone exits the room.

Grandfather returns.

GRANDFATHER
The tea and soup is ready.

WASHU
Please have Sasami bring it in here.  None of them want to leave.

Grandfather nods his head and exits the lab.

WASHU
I have a lot of work to do.

TENCHI
Will you tell me how you got here Little Washu?

WASHU
Another time Tenchi, but not now.

Washu exits the far side of the lab.

Sasami enters the lab and drops off the tea and soup on Washu's desk.

She turns to go.

TENCHI
Will you tell me what happen to you and Little Washu?

Sasami turns to look at Tenchi.

SASAMI
No, Ms. Washu will have to tell you.

Tenchi nods his head.

Sasami exits the lab.

Kazuhiko stands and walks over to Washu's desk.

He gets two bowls of soup and two cups of tea.

KAZUHIKO
We are still alive to fight another day Tenchi. Would you like some?

TENCHI
Yes please.  Where will it end Kazuhiko?  I always hoped that tomorrow
would bring bigger and better things.  Now I am afraid of what tomorrow
will bring.

Kazuhiko brings the tea and soup to Tenchi.

Kazuhiko raises his cup in salute.

KAZUHIKO
Here's to a better tomorrow Tenchi.  Because today was a hell of a mess.

Tenchi lets loose a grim chuckle and raises his cup.

Both men drink.

INT. Grandfather's bedroom door - NIGHT

Washu enters the scene carrying a tray.  On the tray are a teapot and
cups plus some cakes.

Washu knocks on the door.

The door opens with Grandfather standing in front.  He is wearing his
pants but no shirt.

GRANDFATHER
It is late Washu.

WASHU
I though we could share some tea.
 
Grandfather steps to the side and Washu enters.

The door closes.

WASHU (O. C.)
I want a full report on what happened.

GRANDFATHER (O. C.)
I was with Tenchi the whole time.

WASHU (O. C.)
Very good.  I want to know everything my guinea pig did while I was away.

INT. Washu's lab - DAY (Tuesday, 8 July 1997)

Ryoko, Ayeka, and Ryoe lie sleeping on beds.

Tenchi is sitting in a chair, asleep, with his head lying on Ryoko's bed.

Washu enters the lab with a tray of food and drink.

WASHU
Good morning Tenchi.

Tenchi opens his eyes and looks up.

TENCHI
Good morning Little Washu.

Washu sets the tray on her desk and proceeds to check the three patents.

WASHU
Help yourself to breakfast.

TENCHI
How are they this morning?

WASHU
Ayeka will wake up tomorrow afternoon feeling fine.  Ryoe will awake
in about four days and Ryoko in six days.

TENCHI
Why is it taking so long for Ryoko?

WASHU
Is that all you wonder about Ryoko?

TENCHI
Well I would like to know why she is even alive?  I saw Shihou run his
Light Hawk Wing blade through her heart.

Washu sits at her desk and helps herself to breakfast.

WASHU
Please join me Tenchi.

Tenchi lets go of Ryoko's hand and pulls his chair up to Washu's desk.

WASHU
Why did you give the gems back to her?

TENCHI
When we first met I thought she had her gems.  I found out later she had
made fake ones and all her gems were in my Tree Key.  I gave one back
to her when Ayeka attacked us.

WASHU
And after two years you finally give her back the other two.

TENCHI
I did not trust her to have anymore.  She is way too impulsive.

WASHU
What changed your mind?

TENCHI
I love her Mom.  Our plan was going to separate us.  I had to stay with
Mihoshi.  I didn't want to lose her for my own selfish reasons.  It was
a spur of the moment act.

WASHU
Will you take them back now?

TENCHI
I can do that?

WASHU
Whenever you want to.  You do it the same way you gave them to her.  You
could do it right now easily.

TENCHI
They were a gift to her from you.  They belong to her now.

WASHU
When I made her she was the daughter I never had.  You know how I like to
improve on things?

TENCHI
Sometimes Little Washu I wonder if it is an improvement.

Washu starts to laugh.

WASHU
Well even the number one scientific genius in the universe can make an
occasional mistake.

Tenchi joins in the laughter.

WASHU
When I made Ryoko I made a few modifications.  Her heart is centered low
in her chest and is much larger than yours.  It is more efficient.  This
also allowed me to give her larger lungs.

TENCHI
That explains why the sword did not kill her.  Why is she taking so long
to heal?

WASHU
I also gave her denser bones and muscle mass.  This density made her
more susceptible to the radiation.

Tenchi nods his head.

WASHU
Her ability to regenerate makes anything short of sudden death a mere
flesh wound.

TENCHI
I have seen that in action from the first day I met her.

Washu's eyes mist over.

WASHU
There is something else you need to know about her Tenchi.  I wanted
to tell her before you were married but I couldn't.

TENCHI
You don't have to tell me either Little Washu.  She can keep her secrets.

WASHU
You don't understand Tenchi.  I never planned for Ryoko to conceive
a child.

TENCHI
What do you mean?

WASHU
Ryoko is not genetically compatible with anyone.  She can not bear
your children Tenchi.

TENCHI
She doesn't know?

WASHU
I don't have the heart to tell her.

TENCHI
Little Washu you can fix anything.  Can't you fix this?

WASHU
Yes I could fix it, but would you want me to.  Would Ryoko want me to?

TENCHI
Why?  Why wouldn't we?

WASHU
If I make her genetically compatible with you she will still look
like Ryoko, but there won't be anything left of the Ryoko you know
and love inside of her.

TENCHI
What?

WASHU
I would have to alter her DNA.  It will destroy her personality
and memories.

TENCHI
Is that the only option?

WASHU
No, there is one more option.

Tenchi waits

WASHU
I could plant someone else's egg in her for you to fertilize.
 
Tenchi's face shows his understanding.

WASHU
She would bear the child but it would not have any part of her in
the child.

TENCHI
I had a dream Little Washu.  Let me tell you about it.

Washu nods her head.

TENCHI
I dreamed this after I thought you and Sasami were dead.  I believe
that I died inside because I could not save both of you.

WASHU
You couldn't know what happened to us.  I didn't have any time to
tell you.

TENCHI
You still need to tell me what happened, but first let me tell you
my dream.

WASHU
Okay.

TENCHI
I dreamed of Ryoko standing with my Grandfather.  Grandfather was
holding a baby and Ryoko asked him if he was proud of his great
granddaughter.  Grandfather said he was.  Ryoko said the baby had
a lot of you in her and also some of Grandfather.  Grandfather thought
it was more of me, then him, they saw.  They spoke as if I was dead.
That is what helped me to snap out of my self pity.

WASHU
So you think this means you will have a daughter with Ryoko?

TENCHI
There is one more part of the dream.  The baby Grandfather was holding
had red hair just like yours.

Washu blushes.

TENCHI
I said I would have your baby when you felt the time was right.  If
Ryoko has to use someone else's egg.  I believe we both will want it
to be yours.

WASHU
It is more than I could have ever hoped for Tenchi.

	TENCHI
We will tell Ryoko together Little Washu.

Kiyone enters the lab.

KIYONE
Hello Tenchi.  I have the Yagami fixed.  We can leave for Jurai
anytime you want.

TENCHI
Thank you Kiyone.  I don't think I ever thanked you for coming to
our rescue.

KIYONE
You should thank Mihoshi for that.  I don't know how she tracks me
down, but she never fails to put me where I don't want to be.

TENCHI
I think you are a little hard on Mihoshi.  She did do a good job
against Shihou.


KIYONE
Tenchi, I love Mihoshi, and I hate her.  I understand her completely,
and I don't understand her at all.  She makes me happy one moment
and frustrates me the next.  It is impossible for me to explain.

WASHU
Mihoshi is impossible.  Thank goodness there is only one of her in
the universe.

TENCHI
There is more to Mihoshi than she will ever let us know.  She came
very close out there in the desert to give me a glimpse of her true self.

KIYONE
And it scared you didn't it?
 
Tenchi nods his head.

KIYONE
So when do you want to leave?

TENCHI
Not until all three of them have recovered.

Kiyone nods her head.

KIYONE
Okay then.  Just let me know when you want to go.  I have no pressing
business to be anywhere.

Kiyone leaves the lab.

Tenchi takes some breakfast and begins to eat.

TENCHI
So Little Washu it is your turn to tell a story.

WASHU
I had Sasami wait in my lab at the first sign of trouble.  After
Yukinojo's engines went off line I came out to fix them, and to
check on the gamma beam I installed.

TENCHI
I remember you coming up to the bridge after that.

WASHU
Yes I did.  I then went back to join Sasami in my lab.  I had two
doors to the Yukinojo and one door to Ryo-Ohki.  Where I made my
mistake is that I didn't have any doors to anyplace else.

TENCHI
What do you mean?

WASHU
The rest of my doors where to the bathhouse already in sub-space and
to the house.  I shrunk the house and took it with me to the lab.
Sasami enjoyed using it as a dollhouse.  All my other doors were
to different parts of my lab.

TENCHI
So with Yukinojo and Ryo-Ohki destroyed you were trapped in sub-space.
You told be before that you can't find anything in sub-space because
it's so big.

WASHU
I was trapped all right.  When the Yukinojo doors didn't work it could
only meant the Yukinojo was gone.  I knew that my only hope was that
Ryo-Ohki wasn't destroyed.  Her rebirth would not have the portal.

TENCHI
How did you get out?

WASHU
Sasami thought of it.  She asked me about my door to Yagami.  I told
her it was deactivated.  So she asked why didn't I activate it.

TENCHI
So you did.

WASHU
Yes.  Finding things not in sub-space is easy.  As soon as I found
the Yagami I reactivated the door.  It was quite the surprise for
Kiyone to find us on her ship.

TENCHI
When did you do that?

WASHU
She was already in orbit looking for the Yukinojo.

TENCHI
So it was Mihoshi that brought her to the planet.

WASHU
Yes, pretty amazing huh.

TENCHI
Will you tell me one other thing Little Washu?

WASHU
Better than that Tenchi.  Let me show you.

Washu stands and moves to the far lab door.

Tenchi follows.

INT. Washu's second lab - DAY

A large glass cylinder stands in the middle of the room.

A rod extends from a machine into the center of the cylinder from
the side.

Washu and Tenchi enter the room.

TENCHI
What is in the cylinder?

WASHU
Daijiro's clone.

TENCHI
And what will you do with his clone?

WASHU
I copied it from his body.  I also took some cells not damaged by the
radiation to make the clone.

Tenchi
So this clone will be physically and mentally the same?

Washu
I hope to give Daijiro back to Ryoe.  What I can't tell yet is how
much of his memory was lost.

TENCHI
His memory?

WASHU
When you die your body starts to decay immediately.  The memory is
one of the first things to go.  First you lose your most recent
memories and so it goes until there is nothing left.

TENCHI
It was almost three hours after he died before you read his memory.

WASHU
Yes, but the radiation slowed down the decay.

TENCHI
What is your best guess?

WASHU
He could lose up to a year in memories.

TENCHI
Now Ryoe just has to wait eighteen years.

WASHU
If that were true I wouldn't have bothered to do this.

TENCHI
I'm sorry Little Washu.  I keep forgetting you are the number one
genius scientist in the universe.

WASHU
Right now while I download his memories he is growing at ten times
normal rate.  After seven months I will accelerate that to one hundred
times normal.  He will be ready for Ryoe in about eight and a half months.

TENCHI
Little Washu you truly amaze me!

WASHU
We still need to see what Ryoe says about all of this.

TENCHI
I think she will be happy even if he loses a full year of his memory.

WASHU
I hope so Tenchi.  I really do.

TENCHI
Little Washu?

WASHU
Yes Tenchi.

TENCHI
Are you going to ask me about the Light Hawk Wings?

WASHU
No Tenchi.  I have finished with that line of research.

TENCHI
Finished?

WASHU
You know now how to summon the Light Hawk Wings, and so does Ryoko.
Together you can do what only Tsunami could do before.

TENCHI
How does that finish your research?

Washu
I have found the answer to my question.  Do you like being my guinea
pig Tenchi?

Tenchi
Sometimes it's kind of fun, and I do like to see you smile Little Washu.

Both exit the lab.

FADE OUT:

THE END
