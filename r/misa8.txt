Sasami walks back into the study to see Tenchi still in front of the
computer.  A bit cautious, "So, have you read the whole thing?"

"I just finished."

"And?"

"I'm quite a bit shocked."

<Oh, no.>  "At what?"

"First of all, the beginning of the second part shocked me."

"Oh, that."

"Part five shocked me even more.  Now I wonder-"

"-if the story reflects the author, right?"

"Right."

"It might, it might not.  It's only a story."

Tenchi gets up and walks out, "now, I don't know what to think."

"Oh, boy."

End Side Story!

==========

Sasami:  I know exactly what you're thinking:  "Who is Riko?"  Well,
I'll let the story explain.

Author's notes:  This one's been nagging at me for awhile.  I didn't
know if I should do it or not.  Well, I did.

Misa:  Riko

        Misa approaches the house, deep in thought.  <Riko, I don't know
what
to do.  I can't go back.  I can't forfeit everything I've worked for.>
Walking in, she sees Ryo staring at her, saddened.

        <Misa,> the cabbit says through the link, <what's wrong?  And who's
Riko?>

        <I have to see Washu,> she responds, stepping into the lab.

        "I've been expecting you, Misa."

        "Really?  How?"

        "You are connected to Ryo, and so am I.  I know you want to see
Riko.
But, I have one question."

        "What is that?"

        "Who is Riko?"

        "She's...my daughter."

        For the first time in a long time, Washu is genuinely shocked.  "I'm
sorry.  I didn't know.  So, why didn't you bring her with?"

        "Two reasons, actually.  First, there wasn't enough power in the
time
machine to send her back.  And the other reason is..."  The events of
the past day finally take their toll as Misa starts to sob a bit.

        "Misa, what's wrong?"

        "Riko..." she sobs, "Riko was upstairs when..."

        "I see.  You not only want to retrieve her, but save her life as
well."

        Misa simply nods.  "I have to do this."

        "Why don't you wait awhile.  Give yourself time to recover."

        Composing herself, "maybe you're right.  It has been a rough day for
me."  Walking out, "Thank you."

        <Poor girl.  She had to give up the most important thing in her
life.
Just like I did...>

==========

        The following day, Misa walks into Washu's lab.  "Washu?"

        "Are you ready to go?"

        "Yes, I am.  Is the time machine ready?"

        "You won't be using the time machine."

        "Then, what will I use?"

        "I'll send you back using Dimensional Cause and Effect Controller.
Since you're going to an alternate dimension, the time machine won't
work."

        "Can you find my dimension?"

        "I already have.  Since you're from a different timeline, your RNA
signature is different.  That RNA signature can't be changed by any
known means.

        "So, you just searched for my signature?"

        "Bingo!"

        "So, then, let's do it."

        "Remember one thing:  I can't send you to a very specific point.
You
may end up a few days before the incident."  Moving towards her, Washu
gives Misa a small device.  "When you have Riko, press the button.  It
will send the two of you back here."

        "If I end up a couple of days before the incident, how will I get
Riko?
I watched her like a hawk."

        "That's the good part.  You will be the Sasami of your timeline.
You
just have to remember when the attack was and get Riko out."

        "I understand."

        Washu turns towards her device and hits a few keys.  After a second,
Misa starts to glow.  When it fades, her past counterpart appears.

        "Washu?  What's going on?"  Sasami asks.

        "It's alright.  I'll explain everything."

==========

In Misa's past

        Misa awakes to find herself in her room.  <Am I back?>  Looking at
the
crib, "Riko!"

        She stands to look at her baby.  "I've missed you."  <How far back
did
I go?>  Misa asks herself.

        Looking in the mirror, she sees her forehead is still missing the
two
dots.  <Looks like it was a complete switch.  Now, I just gotta figure
out WHEN I am.>

==========

        "You're going to WHAT?!?"  Sasami shouts to Washu.

        "Calm down, will ya?"

        "How can I?  You just told me you were going to take my baby.  How
can
I calm down?"

        "Sasami, look.  You came back to the past to change the future.  You
volunteered for many reasons.  I believe this is one of them."

        "Is something going to happen?  Is something going to happen to
Riko?"

        "Please understand.  We're doing this for Riko's sake."

        Struck by that statement, Sasami starts to calm down.  <Damn you!>

==========

        <Kagato will attack tomorrow.  I should prepare.  I know my past
self
won't stand to see her child missing, so I should make it look like how
I saw it.>  Holding Riko, "this will all be over soon."

        Tenchi walks in, "is everything all right?  You aren't talking
much."

        "Yes, I'm fine.  I've just been thinking."  <You know, if this is MY
Tenchi, then...>  Smiling, "Tenchi..." she coos.  <I should have thought
of this sooner!>

        Setting Riko in the crib, "Tenchi, it's been awhile since we...you
know."

        "It has, hasn't it?" he responds, moving closer.  "Well, look what
happened last time."

        Slipping off her shirt, <after all, he is my husband.>  As she
starts
to kiss him, she slips off her shorts.

==========

        "Washu?" Sasami asks.

        "Yes, Sasami?" she says, typing.

        "Can I at least see what's going on?"

        "Of course."  Keying in a specific sequence, Washu brings up a 1' by
1'
screen in front of them.  After a second of haze, the screen clears.

        "What the hell?" Sasami says, shocked at the image.

        Washu dissipates the screen, "sorry, bad timing."

        "That-That-" Sasami stammers.

        "This is the last time she'll ever get to be with her husband.  Give
her a break."

        Clenching her fist, <if I ever meet her, I'LL KILL HER!>

==========

        Misa, lying on her back, <I enjoyed that!>  Looking at her sleeping
husband, <I know this is the last time we'll ever meet, so I wanted to
go out with a bang.>  Looking at the clock, <5:00.  Five more hours.
Five more hours until this is all over.>

        Misa stands and dresses.  Getting a new set of clothes, <I need a
bath
first.>  Kissing Tenchi on the forehead, she heads for the bath.  <I
should take Riko and be in the living room when Ryoko attacks.  That
should be perfect.>

==========

        Ryoko walks into Washu's lab.  Seeing 'Misa' and Washu, "Washu,
Misa,
it's time for lunch."

        "Later, Ryoko," Washu says. "We're busy."

        "Fine," she says, leaving.

        "Washu, who's Misa?"

        "Misa is who went to get Riko.  Since Sasami's already here, she
said
she wanted to be called Misa."

        "That makes sense."

        Washu pulls out a small box with the last glowing triangle in it.
<I
should clear her memories of her time here.  She knows too much, now.>
Pressing a couple of buttons on the box, she programs it.

==========

        Misa, ready to enact her plan, heads for her bedroom.  <This is
going
to work.  I just need to make sure I get Riko.>  Walking in the bedroom,
she sees the crib in sight.  Picking up the baby, "it's time to go,
Riko."

        Walking downstairs, she holds her baby close.  Seeing Ayeka, Tenchi,
and Washu in the living room, she recognizes the scene.  As if on cue,
Ryoko teleports into the room.

        "Ryoko!" Tenchi says.

        Ryoko turns to see Misa and Riko.  "You.  Give me the child."

        "What?"  <Wait!  This isn't how it happened!>

        "I said, give me the baby."  Activating her beam sword, "now!"

        <Ah, who cares!>  Cradling Riko in one arm, she makes a sword in the
other.  "You'll have to kill me first!"  <Why is she after Riko?  I
thought she was after Ayeka!>

        Suddenly, Ayeka puts Ryoko in a full nelson.  "Run!  I'll hold her!"

        Deactivating her sword, Misa runs outside with Tenchi and Washu.  <I
gotta go!>  Pulling out Washu's device, she presses the only button on
the thing.  <Not the way I planned at all, but it works.>  After a flash
of light, Misa and Riko are replaced by Sasami.

        Seeing the house explode in flames, "where's Ayeka?"  <Oh, no!>
"Ayeka
was in there!"  Suddenly more aware, <RIKO!!!>

==========

        Appearing in the lab, Misa looks down at her prize.  "We're home,
Riko."

        "I was able to watch parts of your time there."

        <Oh, no...did she see...?>

        "I gotta tell ya, Sasami was not happy."

        "Would you have acted any differently?"

        "No."  Looking at Riko, "she is cute.  Well, I think everyone else
wants to see why we've been in here so long."

==========

        Washu is the first to step out of the lab, and sees that everyone
else
is present.  "We have a new guest in the house."

        "Who is it?"  Sasami asks.

        Misa walks out, cradling Riko.  "This is Riko Jurai Masaki, my
daughter."

        "Where did she come from?" Tenchi asks.

        "I wanted to keep this a secret to avoid problems.  After all, I
wanted
everything to be perfect.  But, I went back to my timeline to get her."

        "I feel so happy for you, Misa," Ayeka says.

        Tenchi sees Ryoko staring at him strangely.  "Don't even think about
it, Ryoko."

        "What?" she responds, "I was just wondering if you wanted a child.
I'd
be more than happy to-"

        "RYOKO!" Ayeka shouts.

        "So, how old is she?" Sasami asks.

        "Well, Sasami, she's five months old.  Her birthday is March 9th."
Thinking for a second, "would you like to hold her?"

        "Sure!"

        Handing her Riko, "I think Ryo and Ryo-Ohki might want a closer
look."

        Seeing the cabbits sitting on the couch, Sasami moves Riko closer to
them.  Both cabbits look at the cute infant, meowing softly.

        Misa is still thinking about her trip.  <Why did Kagato send Ryoko
after Riko?  I thought she came for Ayeka.  Maybe... No, it couldn't
be...>

        "Misa, what's wrong?" Ayeka asks.

        "When I went back, I found out that Kagato was after Riko, and not
after you.  I wonder why?"  <I did have Riko while being connected to
Tsunami.  Maybe that will have an influence.>  "Oh, well.  I have Riko,
now, and that's all that matters to me."

-a new beginning-
