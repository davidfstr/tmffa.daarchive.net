Hi!  It's me, the SoJ.  This is my first fanfic, but I should explain 
that this was supposed to be a multipart story.  Unfortunately, all of 
the parts got deleted, so you will have to just deal with the complete 
version.  Also, my first prologue sucked so I changed it a little for 
the complete version.  Last of all, I do not own Tenchi Muyo!  I think 
it belongs to Pioneer and some other important company.  And without 
further adieu, Episode One!
***********************************************************************
Ninamo the priestess ran down the hall.  "Kaima!  Kaima!  Where 
are you?" she cried.  Up ahead, a woman a little older was waiting for 
her.
	"Kaima!  Thank goodness!  The Sorceress, she's-she's-" Ninamo 
struggled.
	"I know Nina-chan, she's dead.  But we cannot grieve now.  Did 
she tell you where the successor was?" Kaima asked.
	"Yes!  She's on this little planet, Earth I think, in the middle 
of nowhere.  She's still very young, so we can start training her right 
away," replied Ninamo.
	"Earth, why does that sound so familiar?" wondered Kaima.  "I 
know!  Earth was where Yosho was last seen!"
	"Really?  That must mean that the successor is his 
granddaughter!" cried Ninamo.
	"You're right Nina-chan!  We have to go now, before Medea finds 
her," exclaimed Kaima.  The two priestesses teleported to Earth.
***********************************************************************
	"I'm not happy about this," said Achika to her father, Yosho.  
"She's my first and only daughter, and poor little Tenchi-"
	"I know, I know, but it's her destiny, and Keimosari must become 
the Sorceress of Jurai," Yosho said.
	"I still hate it.  I'll probably never see her again," said 
Achika.  Suddenly, Kaima and Ninamo appeared.
	"Is she ready?" asked Ninamo.  Achika nodded, then kissed her 
daughter goodbye.
	"Farewell, Keimosari," she said softly.  The baby made no sound 
as her mother handed her to Ninamo.  Kaima pulled out a purple stone, 
and for a moment, a light brighter than the sun flashed across the 
Earth.
	"No one will remember her now, except for you two.  If you tell 
anyone though, she will never be allowed to leave the Palace of the 
Sorceress," explained Kaima.  Achika and Yosho nodded sadly.
	"Is she ready Nina-chan?" asked Kaima. Ninamo nodded.  Then, the 
two priestesses and the new Sorceress of Jurai disappeared, taking the 
memory of the child with them.
***********************************************************************
	What's wrong Tenchi?" asked Sasami.  Tenchi hadn't eaten any of 
his breakfast, and had been very quiet all morning.
	"Huh? Oh! Nothing.  I guess I'm just not hungry right now," said 
Tenchi.
	"Are you sick?" Sasami felt his forehead.  Tenchi laughed.  Here 
was a little girl, fussing over him as if she were his mother.
	"I'm fine Sasami! Really!" Tenchi smiled.  Sasami still wasn't 
convinced.  
	"Tell you what Sasami.  I'll go out and work in the garden all 
morning and work up a big appetite for lunch," Tenchi said.  
	"All right then," said Sasami cheerfully.  Tenchi looked at her. 
She's such a sweet girl.  He shivered.  She wasn't like the girl in his 
dream.  The girl who was so strange, yet so familiar.  It's just a 
dream Tenchi thought.  Only a nightmare.  He shrugged the feeling off 
and headed out the door.
***********************************************************************
*
	Later that night, Tenchi awoke with a start.  He wasn't sure 
quite what it was that woke him up.  Had Aeka and Ryoko been fighting 
again?  No, because if they had been, the house would be all smoky.  
Then the answer hit him.
	"It's that weird dream again," Tenchi said out loud.  He had had 
the dream ever since he could remember.  It was always the same.  He 
would be standing on the edge of the lake, and a girl wearing a black 
robe and holding a gold staff with a large bauble on top would appear 
on the surface, actually on top of the water.  She would walk closer 
and closer to him, sometimes saying his name.  But the strangest part 
was, she always appeared to be the same age as Tenchi.  When he was a 
small child, she was.  When he was about ten years old, she was.  And 
now, she had taken on an appearance similar to Tenchi's mother, Achika. 
	A noise interrupted Tenchi's thoughts.  It was low and high at 
the same time.  And it came from outside.  Quickly and quietly, Tenchi 
got dressed, and sneaked out of the house and walked to the edge of the 
lake.  
***********************************************************************
*	Tenchi had been standing on the lake's edge for about an hour.  
It was a little after midnight and he found himself nodding off.  He 
was about to go back inside when he saw something on the lake.  There 
was a flash of light, brighter than the sun, and then a figure 
materialized on the lake.  It was the girl!
	She walked closer and closer to Tenchi, who felt paralyzed by the 
girl.  Finally, Tenchi worked up enough strength and courage to speak.
	"A-are you my mother?" he stammered.  The girl shook her head.  
"Well then, who are you?" he asked bravely.  The girl smiled 
devilishly.
	"Keimosari, and I am very disappointed that you don't recognize 
your own sister," she said coolly.  Tenchi gasped.
	"My sister?  I don't have a sister!"  he exclaimed.
	"Um, yes you do.  I'm standing right here in front of you" she 
replied.
	"This is a really weird dream.  Are you sure you're not looking 
for someone else?" asked Tenchi.
	"No Tenchi, she's in the right spot," said a voice.  Tenchi's 
grandfather, Yosho, stepped out from behind a tree.
	"Grandfather!" cried Keimosari.  She hugged him tightly.  Tenchi 
stared.
	"Uh, would someone mind explaining why you two are hugging and 
why what's-her-name is claiming she's my sister?" asked Tenchi.
	"My name is Keimosari!" the girl snapped.  "And I am your 
sister!"
	"Alright, alright!  Stop your bickering and I'll explain 
everything," Yosho replied.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Tenchi, Keimosari is indeed your sister.  Your twin sister in 
fact.  She was taken to a small moon near Jurai when she was born.  One 
of the priestesses that came to collect her cast a strong spell that 
made everyone on earth who did not have Jurai blood in their veins 
forget she was ever born.  This means all of your father's family and 
your father.  Your mother, however, did not forget, and neither I.  You 
did not truly remember her, because the two of you were separated at 
birth and you never saw her again.  Until now," said Yosho.
	"But why didn't you or Mom tell me about her?" asked Tenchi.
	"It was forbidden.  We could never hope to see her again if we 
told anyone, including you," answered Yosho.  He turned to Keimosari.  
"But what I'm wondering is, why are you here Keimosari, and how did 
Tenchi know you would come tonight?"  Keimosari took a few deep 
breaths, but looked away.
	"And please be sure to explain to Tenchi why you've been gone so 
long" Yosho added.  Keimosari looked up in fright, and began her story.
	"Tenchi, you know about Jurai.  I know that the Princesses Aeka 
and Sasami are living with you, as well as Ryoko, Washu, Kiyone and 
Mihoshi.  I believe you also know about the Ultimate Power that belongs 
to the Jurai Royal family.  Your sword, Tenchi, is an outlet of it.  
Well, you see." Keimosari paused.  " I am the Ultimate Power, sort of.  
I am the Sorceress of Jurai.  I was taken away to live at the Palace of 
the Sorceress on one of Jurai's moons.  I learned to use the Star of 
Jurai," she motioned to the bauble on her staff, which contained a 
large topaz surrounded by ten other multicolored jewels.  "And I also 
learned to cast spells.
	"One day, I was bored so I walked through the library and I found 
a book listing every Sorceress of Jurai there ever was.  I was 
wondering if my predecessor was in there, so I read it.  But when I got 
to the end, I found out I was in the book!  There was a little 
biography of every Sorceress, and that's when I learned that I was from 
Earth.  After a little more research, I learned that I had family 
there, and that the former Emperor Yosho was my grandfather.  I had 
recently learned a spell that allowed me to see things and people very 
far away.  So--I um--how do I phrase this?--okay, I spied on you guys.  
That's how I know that all of those women are living with you Tenchi," 
she finished.
	"But that still doesn't answer why you're here," said Tenchi.
	"Okay, okay.  I ran away all right!  I hate being a sorceress.  I 
have no friends, and the priestesses are always following me.  I wasn't 
even allowed to leave Star Territory!  I just thought that things would 
be different here, that I would just be treated as I am.  Like you 
treat the other girls Tenchi," she snapped.  In the darkness, Tenchi 
could see the sadness, anger, fear, and disappointment in her eyes.  
Then he realized that he felt sorry for her.
	"Well, it's to late to send you home now.  You go in the house 
and sleep Keimosari.  We'll figure out what to do in the morning," said 
Yosho.
	"Grandpa?  Where is she going to sleep?  If we put her in a room 
with the others, they might freak out and do something, um, violent," 
said Tenchi.
	"I thought she could sleep in the study," replied Yosho.
	"The study?  But that's attached to my room!" said Tenchi.
	"Can you think of a better spot?" asked Yosho.  Tenchi said 
nothing.  "That's what I thought.  Find her some clothes and I'll see 
you in the morning."
***********************************************************************
*
	A few moments later exhaustion overwhelmed Tenchi.  He figured it 
would be best to just do what Grandpa said rather than to cause 
problems with this apparently new addition to the household.  He 
wondered how the others would take it.  
	Maybe Aeka and Sasami would know Keimosari.  They were from Jurai 
too.  But a gut feeling told him that the biggest riff would be between 
Keimosari and Ryoko.  He smiled to himself thinking of how 
overprotective she was for a ruthless, mean, space pirate.
	"Tenchi?" asked Keimosari, breaking his thoughts.
	"Yeah?" he answered softly.
	"Thanks.  I mean, for not making a big deal about this mess.  I 
know now that I should have found a way to contact you ahead of time 
instead of barging in like this.  I was being selfish.  And I'm just 
glad you're not too angry," she said.
	Tenchi showed her the study, then remembered about the clothes.  
He looked at her.  It was easier to see her in the light.  She was 
wearing a long black robe flecked with gold and her long black hair was 
tied into a ponytail.  The strangest thing was the striking resemblance 
she had to Tenchi's mother, just like in the dream.
	That's it! thought Tenchi.  He would get his mother's old clothes 
from the attic.  Keimosari looked about the same size as her.  And it 
would be interesting to see if she could really be mistaken for her 
mother.
	He returned with the clothes a few minutes later.
	"Will you be okay tonight?" Tenchi asked.  Keimosari nodded.  
"Can you do me a favor?  Stay in there until I knock in the morning.  
If the others see you, there could be trouble.  Not that I doubt your 
power or anything."  Keimosari just stared at him.  Actually, Tenchi 
did find the fact that Keimosari was a sorceress hard to believe.  
"Yeah.  Well goodnight, Keimosari," he turned to leave.
	"Tenchi?  Call me Kei.  I always wanted people to call me that," 
she smiled.  She had a beautiful smile that lit up her face.  Tenchi 
smiled too.
	"Sure Kei," he answered.
***********************************************************************
***************
	The next morning, Tenchi knocked on the study door.  "Are you 
awake Kei?"  He called.  The door opened.  Tenchi gasped.
	It was Keimosari all right, but she was dressed different.  She 
was wearing a pale blue dress that had belonged to Tenchi's mother.  
Wearing it, anyone would think Keimosari and Achika were the same 
woman.  Tenchi blinked back the tears, but Keimosari noticed.
	"Do you want me to take it off?" she asked softly.  Tenchi shook 
his head.  Keimosari took his hand.
	"Tenchi, I know your-our mother is dead," she said softly.  She 
squeezed his hand reassuringly.  "Tenchi, are you ready?  I need you 
now, to reintroduce me to Earth."
	Tenchi managed a small smile.  "Come on.  You don't want to miss 
one of Sasami's breakfasts,"
***********************************************************************
***************
	Aeka, Washu, Kiyone, and Mihoshi were eating breakfast when 
Tenchi appeared at the door.  He took a deep breath.
	"Sasami, is there enough for one more?" he asked.  Sasami smiled.
	"For you Tenchi, of course," she replied.
	"Um, not for me Sasami," he stalled.
	"Well, who then?" Sasami asked.  Tenchi didn't answer.  A girl 
stepped out from behind him.  She was about the same age as Tenchi, and 
had long black hair pulled back in a ponytail.  A large topaz hung on a 
chain around her neck.
	"Tenchi!  Who is she?" screamed Aeka.
	"Oh my goodness!" cried Sasami.
	"Cool!  Tenchi's got a girlfriend!" exclaimed Mihoshi.
	"You idiot Mihoshi!  That is not good!" yelled Kiyone.
	"Ladies, ladies! Relax!  Keimosari is not my girlfriend, she is 
my sister!" explained Tenchi.
	"And the Sorceress of Jurai," replied Washu softly.  Keimosari 
looked at her.
	"How did you know?" she asked quietly.
	"I saw you and Tenchi last night.  I recognized your staff," 
Washu answered.  Aeka's eyes widened.
	"You?  You're the Sorceress of Jurai?"  she said in disbelief.  
Keimosari nodded.
	"Yeah.  While you guys get over the fact I have a sister and she 
is the Sorceress of Jurai, I need to find Ryoko," said Tenchi 
impatiently.
	As if she could read his mind, Ryoko appeared next to him, 
enveloping him in a big hug.
	"Mmmm, hello sweetheart, What's-HEY! WHO'S SHE?" she screamed, 
pointing an accusing finger at Keimosari.
	"My name is Keimosari, and I am Tenchi's sister," Keimosari 
replied calmly.
	"Well, listen you little moth, Tenchi is mine, so stay away, if 
you know what's good for you!" Ryoko shouted.
	"Ryoko!" Tenchi cried.  Keimosari touched his hand.
	"It's okay Tenchi, I can take care of myself," she answered in 
her same, steady voice.
	"Oh, so that's the way you're going to play it huh?  Well then, 
let's see if you can back it up.  Outside!  Now!" Ryoko cried.
	"Look, I'm not a violent person.  Let's just-" Keimosari started.
	"Come on moth!" Ryoko challenged.
	"Fine.  If you insist.  But please stop calling me 'moth'."  
Keimosari said.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Everyone watched as Ryoko started shooting balls of energy at 
Keimosari.  But just when the balls were about to hit her, she moved 
quickly out of the way.  It happened over and over again until Ryoko 
was panting and tired.
	"Are we quite finished now?" asked Keimosari.
	"You may have the moves moth, but let's see if you've got the 
power," said Ryoko.  For the first time, Tenchi saw flashes of anger in 
his sister's eyes.
	"I asked you quite nicely not to call me that!" she yelled.  She 
grabbed the topaz from around her throat and threw it in the air.  In a 
flash of light, her staff appeared, with the topaz in the middle, and 
the ten other stones around it.  Keimosari narrowed her eyes.  "Now you 
will see me for what I really am."
	She closed her eyes and all of the stones in the staff seemed to 
dim, except for the topaz and a small red stone, which grew brighter 
and brighter.  Finally, Keimosari opened her eyes and a huge stream of 
fire shot out of the top of the staff.  Ryoko was too surprised to 
move.  Just before the flames were about to engulf her, the strange 
dimming of stones happened again, except it was a dark blue stone that 
glowed bright this time.  A jet of water intercepted the flame, and 
instead of fire, Ryoko was surrounded by steam.  
	When the mist cleared, the staff and ten jewels were gone, and 
the topaz was replaced on its chain.  Keimosari approached the shocked 
Ryoko.
	"Never call me moth again," she said dangerously.  Then she 
turned and walked back into the house.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Tenchi found Keimosari sitting on in a tree, deep in thought.  
She had been living with him for a few months now, but she still seemed 
kind of distant to all of the family, especially Tenchi.  The only 
person she really got along with was Washu, who wanted to test her 
power all the time.
	"Kei?  What are you doing up there?" he called.  Keimosari jumped 
down.
	"Thinking.  Tenchi, I think something's wrong," she said.
	"What?" he asked.
	"I came to Earth to find you, thinking I wouldn't feel so lonely.  
But now, I feel just the same as I did at the Palace of the Sorceress.  
Maybe, I should go back," she suggested.
	"No!  Kei don't go!" cried Tenchi.  She looked at him closely.
	"Why do you want me to stay?  I've just caused problems with Aeka 
and Ryoko and everyone else," said Keimosari.
	"I don't know.  I guess it's because, you're my sister.  And-" he 
struggled, "I love you Kei.  I mean, as a sister," he added, blushing.  
Keimosari smiled.
	"I love you too Tenchi.  Because, whether we like it or not, 
we're family," replied Keimosari.
	"And families stay together!" Tenchi exclaimed, grabbing both of 
Keimosari's hands.  Suddenly, she hugged him.  Not like Aeka or Ryoko 
would hug him, but just like two really close friends would.
	"Tenchi?  Do you want to know how to use the Star of Jurai?" she 
asked suddenly.
	"What?  I couldn't!  The Star is yours Kei.  No one but you can 
use it.  That's what Washu said.  But, I wouldn't mind learning how you 
use it," he offered.
	"Okay.  Hold on," she threw the Star of Jurai off of its chain 
and its staff and multicolored stones materialized around it.  She 
placed her hands on the bauble, but let go after a moment.  The staff 
stood straight up by itself.
	"Give me your hands," Keimosari instructed.  Tenchi did as he was 
told.
	"Now, listen closely.  You must put all of your trust in the 
Star.  If your concentration breaks for a moment, or if you let go of 
my hands, you could be hurt badly.  Are you ready?"
	"I think so," Tenchi said.  Keimosari closed her eyes and began 
murmuring a spell.
***********************************************************************
***************
	At first, nothing seemed to happen.  But then there was a flash 
of light so bright Tenchi had to close his eyes.  A strange force 
seemed to pull him in all directions, away from Keimosari.  Soon, his 
will began to give out.  It would be so easy to just let go of 
Keimosari's hands and fly off to who knows where.  But something forced 
him to tighten his hold on his sister's hands.  Just when it seemed he 
couldn't hold on any longer, the pulling stopped.
	"Tenchi?  Are you with me?" he heard Keimosari ask.
	"Yeah," he said, regaining the feeling in his body.  "Where are 
we?"
	"We're on an asteroid in Star Territory, about 600 miles from the 
palace.  I brought you here because this is the only place I can talk 
about how the power works," explained Kei.
	"Wait.  Back it up.  You're telling me we're in the middle of 
space, on an asteroid?" asked Tenchi.
	"Pretty much.  The Star of Jurai has teleportation powers," 
answered Kei.
	"This is so weird," replied Tenchi.  Keimosari smiled.
	"Welcome to my world.  I've had to deal with this ever since I've 
been about five," said Keimosari.
	"But, how can we breathe?" asked Tenchi.
	Keimosari pointed to her staff. The Star of Jurai was glowing 
brightly, along with a clear stone.  
	"The clear stone is the stone of Air.  I've cast a spell that 
allows us to breathe on the asteroid," explained Keimosari.
	"So the clear stone is Air, but what about the others?" asked 
Tenchi.
	"Red is Fire, dark blue is Water, brown is Earth, yellow is 
Electricity, light blue is Ice, green is Physical, and purple is 
Mental," answered Keimosari.
	"But there are two more stones you didn't tell me about, white 
and black," Tenchi pointed out.
	"Those are the strongest stones.  They can only be used when 
someone in serious trouble.  White is Light Power.  It will destroy any 
enemy, as long as the enemy is evil.  However," she lowered her voice,
"Black has no boundaries.  It is Dark Power and will destroy anything 
and everything it is used against.  And if it is used many times, it 
will consume its Keeper, the Ultimate Power, and every member of the 
Jurai Royal Family."
	Tenchi shivered.  If what Kei said was true, the Black Stone 
could destroy Aeka, Sasami, and Tenchi's grandfather.  Tenchi gulped.  
Not to mention me.
	All of a sudden, Keimosari froze.  The Star of Jurai was fading.
	"Uh-oh," said Tenchi.  "What happened?  Did I do something?"
	"No.  Something's happening at the Palace of the Sorceress," 
replied Keimosari.
	"Do we have to go there?" asked Tenchi.  Keimosari nodded.  
Tenchi sighed, dreading the intense pulling again.  "Well, we'd better 
go now."
***********************************************************************
***************
	After the awful pulling again, Tenchi found himself standing 
outside a palace larger than the Imperial Palace on Jurai.  He knew 
this must be the Palace of the Sorceress, Keimosari's home.  But no one 
could live here.  It was as if it had been burning, but there were no 
flames or smoke, just smoldering heaps of building and who knows what 
else.
	"Come on, I've got to find my priestesses," said Keimosari, 
taking off for the half-destroyed building.  Tenchi reluctantly 
followed.
	Inside was a million times worse than the outside.  Bodies of 
young women were everywhere.  When Keimosari saw them, she burst into 
tears.
	"NO!  NO!  Oh Please! No!" she cried.  She rushed to them, one by 
one, searching for some sign of life.  She collapsed into sobs next to 
one priestess, obviously a friend.
	"Ninamo!  Please come back!  I'm not ready!  Don't leave me 
here!" she sobbed.  Tenchi could see she was on the edge of hysterics.  
He pulled her up and wrapped his arms around her tightly.
	"Kei!  Get a hold of yourself!" he cried.  She looked up at him.  
Tenchi almost started crying when he saw her eyes.
	Keimosari had seemed like the strongest person in the universe.  
Now, to see her brokenhearted and lost, Tenchi knew Keimosari wasn't as 
good of protection as she seemed.
	"Kei, they're all dead.  You have to leave now.  Whatever killed 
them might come back," he said softly.  All of a sudden, the light was 
back in Keimosari's eyes.
	"Tenchi!  We have to find Aeka and Sasami!" she cried.  Tenchi 
was puzzled.
	"Why?" he asked.
	"Tenchi, the duty of the Sorceress of Jurai is to protect the 
Royal Family and Jurai at any cost.  If someone came here to try and 
kill me, that means they were going after Jurai!" she explained.
	"You're right!  We've got to go!" cried Tenchi.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Tenchi and Keimosari arrived back at home to find everything 
normal.  Well mildly normal.
	"TENCHI! You've spent enough time with your so-called sister!" 
yelled Ryoko.  
	"It's okay, I'll find Washu and explain," said Keimosari.
	"Explain to Washu what?  Tenchi, what's going on?" asked Ryoko.
	"We don't have time to talk now Ryoko.  I have to find Aeka," 
Tenchi replied.  He ran off in search of the princess.
	"Tenchi!  Come back!" cried Ryoko, who was now alone.  All of a 
sudden, there was a loud roar. 
	A huge spaceship was coming into view.  Ryoko gasped at the size 
of it.  It came lower and lower to the lake, and stopped right above 
it.  A young woman materialized in front of Ryoko.
	"So, Lady Keimosari.  Sorceress of Jurai.  Keeper of the Star.  
Sister of the Crown Prince of Jurai," she said silkily.
	"Um, you've got the wrong person.  I'm Ryoko, the vicious space 
pirate," explained Ryoko.  
	"Liar!    You will pay for your lies Keimosari!"  yelled the 
woman.  
	"Oh yeah, make me!" challenged Ryoko.  She pulled out her energy 
sword and sliced toward the woman.  Just before it hit her, the woman 
moved out of the way.  Again and again, Ryoko dealt normally deadly 
blows, but the woman always moved at the last possible moment.  All of 
a sudden, the woman pulled out a long wand.
	"Now, it is my turn," said the woman. A beam of energy shot out 
of the end of the stick, hitting Ryoko square in the heart.  She 
groaned and crumpled.  Teetering on the edge of consciousness, she 
looked up at the woman.
	"Who are you?" she said.  The woman laughed.
	"They called me Medea.  Now, I am the Dark Sorceress," replied 
the woman.  "And once you're dead, I will be the Sorceress of Jurai."
	"Tenchi," Ryoko called softly, then passed out.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Washu!  Has anything entered the Solar System recently?" cried 
Keimosari, bursting into the lab.
	"Geez, didn't they teach you to knock along with that power?" 
snapped Washu.
	"This is no time for jokes Washu!  Jurai is in serious danger!"  
said Keimosari.
	"Okay, okay.  The only thing that entered is, whoa," cut off 
Washu.  She typed some words on the computer screen. 
	"What?  What?" exclaimed Keimosari.
	"A very large craft has entered the Solar System.  And, it is 
radiating a power that's almost as strong as yours, Keimosari," Washu 
explained.
	"What is it?" asked Keimosari.  All of a sudden, Tenchi and Aeka 
burst in the door.
	"Kei!  Ryoko is hurt!  Bad!  And there is an insane person that's 
trying to kill us!"  exclaimed Tenchi.
	"Azaka and Kamadaki are trying to hold her back, but we need your 
power to fight her," yelled Aeka.
	"Wait!  It's a her?"  cried Keimosari.
	"YES!" cried Aeka and Tenchi in unison.  Without a word, 
Keimosari bolted for the door and ran as fast as she could toward the 
lake.
***********************************************************************
***************
	At the lake, the strange woman was fighting the two floating 
logs.  Keimosari could see she had short blond hair and black eyes.  
She held a long wand and beams of energy were coming out of it.   
Keimosari could see that the logs were weakening.  She threw the Star 
of Jurai into the air and watched the familiar transformation.  As soon 
as it was finished, she grabbed the staff and shot a jet of water at 
the woman.
	"Hey!  I don't know what you're doing here or who you are, but by 
my power as the Sorceress of Jurai you will leave me and my family 
alone!" she cried, following her short speech with a stream of fire.  
The woman cried out in pain as the fire and water hit her, then turned 
to see who spoke.
	"So, the space pirate wasn't lying.  YOU are Lady Keimosari!  
Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the Dark Sorceress Medea.  And you 
Keimosari, are not going to live to see me become the Sorceress of 
Jurai," replied Medea.  She shot another beam of energy out of her 
wand.  Keimosari screamed as the beam shook her.  It was the worst pain 
she had ever felt, both emotional and physical.  
	Meanwhile, Tenchi was watching from behind a tree.  When he saw 
Keimosari get hit by the wand's power, he jumped out, sword drawn.  He 
ran toward Medea, and sliced a tip off her wand.  She screamed.  
Apparently, it was connected to her somehow.  Tenchi raised his sword 
to get her again, but when she turned to look at him, he couldn't move.
	"I know you.  You are the Prince of Jurai," she said.  Tenchi 
could only nod.
	"You know, I'm not as evil as I seem.   For many years I have 
tried to kill all of the Sorceresses of Jurai.  Their Dark Power, you 
know, could destroy everything on Jurai," she said.  Tenchi stared at 
her.  She truly was pretty, and her deep black eyes were mesmerizing.   
Then Tenchi thought about the situation.  The Black Power was really 
strong.  Maybe, just maybe, he could just get Medea to destroy the Star 
of Jurai.
	"Once I do destroy the Star and the Sorceress, you could join me.  
Your sword has a great power as well, Lord Tenchi.  Perhaps, you could 
claim your throne and I will be your queen," Medea coaxed, leaning 
closer to kiss him.  But the trance Tenchi had been in was broken at 
the thought of killing Keimosari and taking the throne.
	"I will never help you kill my sister!" yelled Tenchi.  He swung 
at her.  But the pathetic look of Medea was gone.
	"Fool!  I wasn't going to kill you!  You have power I could use.  
But that doesn't matter now.  If you try to protect your sister, you 
will both die!" cried the woman, and another beam came out of her wand.  
But at the last moment, Aeka jumped in front of Tenchi and formed a 
shield around them.  
	"I don't like it when you threaten Keimosari, but when you 
threaten Tenchi, there is call for revenge.  Right Kiyone?" she said.
	"Right!  Ready Mihoshi?" yelled Kiyone, stepping out of the 
brush.
"Okey-dokey!" agreed Mihoshi.  The two Galaxy Police officers began 
firing at the Dark Sorceress.  It was easy to see Medea was losing.  
But before she retreated to her ship, she levitated Ryoko's motionless 
body and placed it in her ship.
	"Well, if you're satisfied, I won't bother you again.  However, I 
do hope you won't want your friend back.  I have no intention of 
returning her.  
	"No!" cried Tenchi, and ran towards the departing craft.  It was 
too late.  Tenchi sank to his knees.
	Keimosari, regaining her strength, knelt down beside him.
	"I'm sorry I couldn't protect Ryoko," she apologized.
	"It's okay.  I was just so worried about you Kei.  I never 
thought that monster would ever steal an injured woman she never met," 
Tenchi answered rather sorrowfully.
	"Tenchi, I promise you this.  I will save Ryoko," Keimosari said.  
Tenchi turned to her.
	"No Kei.  We will save Ryoko.  Together."
***********************************************************************
***************
	A few minutes later, Ryo-Ohki transformed into a spaceship, with 
everyone aboard.  
	"Washu, can you trace Medea's power to her location?" asked 
Tenchi.
	"I'm already on it," replied Washu.  Keimosari put a hand on her 
brother's shoulder.
	"Tenchi, once you get Ryoko, get to Jurai and warn the military.  
I'll try and hold off Medea as long as I can," she instructed.
	"I won't leave without you Kei," Tenchi answered.
	"No Tenchi.  If it gets too dangerous, I can't afford to endanger 
the Royal Family, especially you Tenchi.  If anything were to happen to 
you, I don't think I could--" Keimosari trailed off.  Tenchi 
understood.
	It was funny that way.  Just a few days ago, he felt like 
Keimosari was a stranger.  Now, he couldn't bear to lose her.
	"There she is!" cried Washu, interrupting the siblings' 
conversation.
	"Where is she?" asked Aeka.
	"There!" answered Washu, pointing at a small moon.  When 
Keimosari saw it, she began shaking.  Medea was at the Palace of the 
Sorceress.
***********************************************************************
***************
	As they approached the Palace, Ryo-Ohki began scanning for 
attacks.  There were none.  However, there was something floating 
around.
	"Oh my gosh!  It's Ryoko!" cried Kiyone.  It was true.  She was 
lying motionless, surrounded by a strange bubble.  It appeared to be 
engulfed in fire, water, electricity, earth, ice, something else they 
couldn't' recognize.
	"You're the sorceress expert Keimosari.  What's wrong with her?" 
asked Aeka.  
	"Well, to be unconscious so long, it would have to be a pretty 
strong sleep spell.  But the bubble," she said, " I've only heard about 
a spell like that.  It's a very powerful force field that uses all of 
the basic powers of the Star of Jurai.  But it would be impossible for 
someone without the Star to perform the spell."
	"Ah, it would be not be impossible without the Star's twin!" said 
a voice.  Medea had patched into the communication system!  Tenchi 
rushed at the screen.
	"Let Ryoko go!" he yelled.
	"Gladly!" said Medea.  Tenchi looked at the bubble.  Ryoko was 
awakening.  But she appeared to be really scared.
	"Oh, and before you rescue her, you might like to know that I 
have the Star of Jurai's twin, the Eclipse Stone.  It is just as 
powerful as the Star, and if not, more powerful.  Well you'd better 
hurry.  Once the sleeping spell I cast on her is broken, she has to 
breathe again."  The picture of Medea faded, but they could still hear 
the laughing.
	"Okay, I'm going out to help her.  Tenchi, cover me.  If Medea 
starts firing, put up all shields and return fire," instructed 
Keimosari.  She cast an Air spell and teleported.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Tenchi could see Keimosari moving closer and closer to Ryoko.  
She began shooting jets of water at the bubble, but without any 
gravity, it all floated away.  Then she tried fire, but without air it 
wouldn't burn.  Keimosari tried everything, but to no avail.  Finally, 
Tenchi saw her close her eyes again.
	Instead of just one stone and the Star of Jurai glowing bright, 
the stone of Fire, Air, Water, Electricity, and Ice all began to shine.  
They glowed brighter and brighter until there was a burst of energy 
shooting out of the staff.  It shook the space around them, and nearly 
threw a small asteroid into Ryo-Ohki.  But when the dust cleared, 
Tenchi could see Ryoko leaning on Keimosari and a second later, the two 
girls appeared next to Tenchi.  Ryoko hugged Tenchi tightly.
	"Are you okay Ryoko?" Tenchi asked.
	"I'm fine.  Hey, Keimosari?  I'm sorry for messing with you all 
this time.  I owe you know," said Ryoko. But Keimosari wasn't 
listening.  She was looking at the ruined palace.  All of a sudden, 
Medea came up on the screen again.
	"Hello!  I was just checking to see how you're doing.  Clever to 
use the Star of Jurai to cast a storm, Keimosari.  But it won't help 
you now," she said.
	"What are you talking about?" asked Keimosari.
	"You see, I've already cast a spell on Ryo-Ohki.  Your ship is 
going to self-destruct as soon as this message is over," said Medea.
	"Oh my God!" cried Tenchi.  "Kei, you've got to-"	
	"I know!" she quickly grabbed his hand and they all formed a 
chain.
	"Don't let go no matter what!" Keimosari yelled.
	They all felt the horrendous pulling as Keimosari teleported them 
from the ship.  However, when the pulling stopped, the place they had 
arrived at struck fear in their hearts.  They were at the Palace of the 
Sorceress, and Medea was standing above them.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Well, you certainly made it easy for me," replied Medea.  She 
stood on a high platform with her wand raised.
	"Really Lady Keimosari, I'd think you would choose a better place 
to escape to than here.  Did you want to face me like a true sorceress?  
I'm hoping so.  But if not, you did bring me the lovely gift of your 
friends' lives.  Not to mention your dear brother," she said.
	"You!  You did something.  You made it so we'd teleport here.  I 
swear Medea-" Keimosari was cut off by some unseen force.
	"Oh that's right!  I did bring you here didn't I?  Thank you for 
reminding me.  You see Keimosari, a whole civilization may stem from 
the Star of Jurai, but the Eclipse Stone only has to supply power for 
me," Medea explained.  Keimosari, still held by whatever spell had been 
cast upon her, closed her eyes to cast a spell, but Medea was too 
quick.
	With one black beam from her wand, she hit Keimosari and knocked 
her staff out of her hand.  Keimosari cried out, temporarily free from 
the spell, then fell to the ground.  Tenchi drew his sword, but Medea 
forced him to stand still as a statue.
	"I'm sorry Tenchi.  I really am.  Now that I have to kill you, 
I'll-wait a minute," Medea stopped.  "I don't have to kill you.  If I 
did, I'll have to way to get the throne.  I can just control you and 
force you to take the throne, then marry me."
	"I would never marry a sick person like you.  Besides, you can't 
control me," Tenchi challenged.
	"Oh I can't, can I?  Well then, I can't make you kill Princess 
Aeka, can I?" Medea answered.  With one beam from her wand, Tenchi 
found himself moving towards Aeka, ready to attack.
	"Run Aeka!" he cried.  But all of a sudden, he was frozen.  He 
saw Keimosari slowly rising from the floor, shaking as if it were a 
great effort.  A green beam was coming out of her staff, and flowing 
into Tenchi.
	"The green stone, Physical," he remembered.  Soon, he was free 
from Medea's power.  But then he saw Keimosari slowly sinking back.  
Medea laughed.
	"Poor girl.  You see, the Star of Jurai isn't only the source of 
her power, it's her life.  Once it's been destroyed, Keimosari and the 
Future Sorceresses will be destroyed." Medea laughed.
	"No!" Tenchi yelled, running to his sister.  She looked up at 
him.
	"Tenchi, she will kill us all unless I use Light Power.  It will 
be too dangerous for all of you to stay here.  I'm going to send you to 
Jurai.  You'll be safe there.  You have all got to stay together, or 
you'll be left behind," she whispered.  Tenchi told the others to grab 
his hands.  Keimosari cast her spell quickly, but just as the others 
were about to disappear, Tenchi let go of their hands.  The girls 
disappeared, and Tenchi was left behind.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Now Medea, I will face you," Tenchi challenged.  He quickly 
glanced at Keimosari.  She was unconscious, but the Star of Jurai was 
still glowing faintly. 
	"Well, this will spoil my plans for now, but I'll just have to be 
careful to kill you," said Medea, then attacked.  Tenchi managed to 
fight off her blows, but soon he was hit.  As he felt the pain course 
through him, he felt someone put their arm around his shoulder.  It was 
Keimosari.
	"Why didn't you go?" she asked.
	"I told you I wouldn't abandon you, and I hate lying," he 
answered.
	"Now this is all very sweet, but I have business to attend to," 
replied Medea.  But suddenly, something happened.
	The white stone in Keimosari's staff was growing brighter, but 
then, the bauble and staff disappeared, leaving only the Star of Jurai 
and the other stones.  Without warning, Tenchi's sword flew out of his 
hand.  The twins watched in amazement as the Star of Jurai and the 
other stones became embedded in the hilt of Tenchi's sword.  As if they 
had practiced it, Tenchi and Keimosari put an arm around each other, 
and placed one hand on the hilt of the sword.  The Lighthawk Wings 
opened, giving them a shield from Medea's attack.
	"The Lighthawk Wings!" Medea said in awe, but then quickly shook 
it off.  With all the power she had, she attacked Tenchi and Keimosari.  
But the shield around them absorbed the attack like it was nothing.  
Then, it was the twins' turn.  A bright white beam came out of the 
shield.  It was the white power.  Medea screamed as it hit her, but 
then shot the brother and sister and look of loathing.
	"You may have killed me, but you will never leave this palace!" 
and with that said, Medea died.
	Tenchi and Keimosari looked at each other, smiled, and hugged 
each other tightly.
	"We make a pretty good team, don't we Kei?" said Tenchi.
	"A really good team.  Too bad it has to end now," Keimosari 
agreed.  Still holding each other's hand, the twins sank to the floor.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Hey!  Tenchi's waking up!" cried the voice of Mihoshi.  Tenchi 
opened his eyes all the way.  He was lying in bed, with everyone around 
him.  They looked really tired, as if they had been next to his bed for 
a long time without sleeping.  
	"Tenchi?  Are you okay?" asked Sasami.
	"I think so.  Where's Kei?" Tenchi asked, looking around for the 
familiar face of his sister.
	"She's-she's still unconscious.  Oh Tenchi, we think she may be 
dying," said Washu gently.  
	"How long has it been since we defeated Medea?" Tenchi asked.
	"About three weeks.  We thought we were going to lose you too.  
Your pulse was slowing way down," said Kiyone.
	"I have to see Kei," Tenchi said.  He slowly stood up, then 
followed Washu down to her lab.  Laying in a force field was Keimosari.  
If it were gone, anyone would have thought she was asleep.  But Tenchi 
saw the deep crack through the Star of Jurai.
	"Washu?  Would you mind?" asked Tenchi.
	"No, of course not.  But don't spend all day in there.  You're 
going to need your rest," she replied.
	Once Tenchi and Keimosari were alone, he reached through the 
force field and held his sister's hand.
	"Kei, I hope you can hear me.  If not, well-I hope you'll get a 
chance later.  I just wanted to say thanks.  I don't know how either of 
us could have beaten Medea without your power.  And, I also wanted to 
say you're the best sister, sorceress, and friend I could ever hope 
for," he said softly.  It was silent in the lab for a long time.  Then 
Tenchi heard a small voice.
	"Thanks Tenchi," it said.  He looked at his sister.  The crack 
was being erased!  Keimosari was waking up.
	"Kei!" he cried.  She sat up and hugged him tightly.  Suddenly, 
Washu burst in the door.
	"Keimosari!  You're alive!" she cried.  Keimosari glared at her.
	"Were you eavesdropping?" she asked.
	"Yes!  And you're alive!" Washu cried.  The three looked at each 
other.
	"Label this one as a 'good day'" said Tenchi.
***********************************************************************
***************
	About a month later, school was starting.  Tenchi and Keimosari 
were sweeping up the yard at the shrine.  
	"Kei?  Do you think you'll ever go back to the Palace of the 
Sorceress?" asked Tenchi.  Keimosari looked at him sadly.
	"I have to.  In fact, I was planning to leave tonight in secret," 
she said softly.
	"Why do you have to leave?" Tenchi asked, putting his hand on her 
shoulder.
	"Because!  I'm not trained all the way, and it's my duty to 
protect Jurai.  And I have to rebuild the Palace, and hire new 
priestesses, and-" Keimosari trailed off.
	"I guess you do have to leave.  But I just met you, I don't want 
to say goodbye," Tenchi said sadly.
	"We won't.  I can come visit you, and you can come visit me," 
Keimosari suggested.
	"It's still not the same," Tenchi answered.  Keimosari patted his 
shoulder and walked down the steps.
***********************************************************************
***************
	That night, Tenchi walked down to the lake.  He remembered the 
day that seemed so long ago that he had met Keimosari, right on the 
lake.  He knew now that dreams of her wouldn't haunt him anymore, but 
they would still make him sad.  Tenchi heard someone come out of the 
house.  It was Keimosari.
	"So, I guess I'm ready to go," she said softly.  Tenchi could 
only nod.
	"Look Tenchi, this is hurting me too.  Let's just make this quick 
and painless, then we can deal with it tomorrow," she said.  
	"Okay.  Before you go Kei, I just wanted to say I love you.   
You're my sister, and I always will," Tenchi replied.
	"I love you too Tenchi.  Don't worry, I'll come back," Keimosari 
smiled, but Tenchi could see the tears streaming down her face.
	"Well, then, goodbye," said Keimosari.  She stepped onto the 
lake, then turned around and threw herself in Tenchi's open arms.  They 
just held onto each other for a long time, then Keimosari turned, 
walked onto the lake without a word, and disappeared.
***********************************************************************
***************
	The next morning, Tenchi heard Ryoko fighting with someone in the 
kitchen.  He couldn't make out her opponents voice, but he was 
overjoyed when he heard Ryoko say,  "You are so dead, moth!"
	"I asked you a million times not to call me that!" cried 
Keimosari.
	Oh yes, thought Tenchi, things are going back to normal.

The End
