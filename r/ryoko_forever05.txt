Chapter 5: "The Powers She Holds"

--------------------------------------------------------------

If you remember in the last chapter Ryoko saw Tenchi and Aeka kissing...
She left and Tenchi told Aeka that he doesn't love her...
Ryoko sits gentally perched on a rock in her 'cave'

"So he finally chose, I was so sure it was going to be me" Ryoko said sobbing uncontrollably.

Where are you Ryoko?? Tenchi was franticly looking for her.
Then he remembered where Ryoko always went, the CAVE!!!

He ran as fast as he could hope he wasn't too late.
He saw Ryoko sobbing to the point in which her eyes were the pools of oceans.

"Ryoko..." Tenchi said.

Ryoko looked up to see 'him'
"What do you want??!!"

"Ryoko, please don't leave I don't love Aeka" Tenchi pleaded.

"Yeah right what about the kiss" Ryoko said with sobs in-between.

"She started it" was all Tenchi could say.

Ryoko looked into his eyes seeing that he was being frank.

"..." 

"Please come home" Tenchi said breaking the silence.

Ryoko gave no reply all she did was teleport away where she went Tenchi does not know.

He walked back to the house hoping to see her there.
I probably really hurt Aeka, Tenchi thought.
I don't know who I love all I know is that it isn't her, Tenchi said to himself with a conclusion.

Back at the house Aeka is in her room not coming out since...'then'
Ryoko had appeared in the kitchen putting on a happy face and offering to help out with Dinner.

"No its ok, thanks for the offer" Sasami said politely.

Tenchi came into the house and saw Ryoko and Sasami talking.
Ryoko looked at him then she went back to talking.
She was a little mad at him but nothing a little of time wouldn't fix.

"Hey guess what??" Sasami said to Ryoko, "Today is a special day, it’s a Jurai holiday"

"Really then we are going to have to celebrate, fireworks. What do you think, Tenchi??" Ryoko turned to Tenchi.

Tenchi looked into her eyes, she’s trying to hide what happened today Tenchi said to himself.
"I think that would be ok, there's fireworks in the shed" 

"Great I am going to get everyone" Sasami said heading towards the other rooms.

"..." Neither Ryoko nor Tenchi spoke.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the evening...the sun was just about ready to set...Everyone is outside ready to light fireworks...
Aeka had even come out because she did not want to worry her little sister...

"Ready everyone??" Kiyone said while giving everyone a mini firework.

"Yes" Everyone yelled in unison.

"Great then its time to play" A dark voice said.

The gang turned and looked at the lake. There a man covered in a black cloche spoke...
"Well hello everyone"

"What do you want???!!!" Ryoko yelled to the man.

"Me I want revenge...Revenge on Jurai on the royal family and of course YOU!!" 

"WHAT!! wait..no..you are the person who sent that demon after me??!!" Ryoko said in shock.

"Well you finally figured it out. Yes, I am the one who sent it" 

"He has unbelievable powers I don't know what to make of it." Washu said typing furiously on her computer.

"Powers or No powers he's going down" Ryoko said instantly transforming into her battle uniform.

"You want revenge on Jurai and the royal family, correct???" A voice from behind Ryoko spoke.

"Why it’s the first princess of Juari, in answer to your question I do." The man spoke.

"Well then I will also challenge you then" Aeka said while her Jurai battle costume came on her.

"Include me too" Tenchi said also getting into his Jurai uniform.

"We'll back you guys up" Mihoshi and Kiyone said with their guns in hand.

"Well the whole crew wants to battle, well then battle you want battle you get." then man said
while a strange blue orb surrounded him.

"Lets GO!!" Ryoko said charging at the man to no prevail.
Aeka and Tenchi tried with their Jurai powers too but no luck 
Then Mihoshi and Kiyone tried but the force field was too powerful.

"Its no use he has some sort of shield" Washu said to the others.

Then the man gave a big blow to all of them they lay burnt and hurt severely.
The man stood up and looked at the hurt group.
He looked at Tenchi and said,"This is for my revenge"
He created a large ball of blue energy he aimed for Tenchi.

No!! please not Tenchi, Ryoko thought.
"Tenchi Watch Out!!!" Ryoko yelled with all her strength.
Tenchi could not move for he had been badly injured.

Ryoko could not move ether.
I must save Tenchi, Ryoko thought.

"Believe" A comforting voice told her.

Believe?? Ryoko thought.

She focused all of her energy on protecting Tenchi.
The man released his ball of energy and it started heading for Tenchi.

"NNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOo!!" Ryoko yelled.
A bright light submerged Ryoko.
I feel warm, Ryoko thought.
Ryoko intercepted the energy ball that was heading for Tenchi,
She had possessed the light hawk wings using her gems.
