TENCHI
                            MAUNGBUHT

BY:Mah Gong Somchay

It was a clear morning at the house of Masaki.Tenchi was outside in the
forest practicing his batting skills but he wasn't doing to good."Dang it
why can't I hit this ball!"Tenchi said throwing up the ball, wating for it
to come back down and then misses when he tries to hit it.Ping and the three
freinds walked by  to see Tenchi.5 days has pass since they been there so
Tenchi and everybody got use to them.

Southi:Thats not how you bat Tenchi.*taking the bat out of Tenchi's hand*
Tenchi:Then how do you do it then Southi?*putting his hand on his hips*
Jyun:Like this.*picks up the ball*
Southi:Now watch carefully.*points the bat towards the distance*

Ping and Boomboi took out there fan and began to cheer.Jyun pitches the ball
towards Southi and then Southi hits it.The ball flew towards the house and
it crash through the living room window."Ooops"Southi said

Tenchi:Ha! What do you know?
BoomBoi:Ohhhh you in trouble.
Southi:Uhhhh...^_^'*rubs the back of his head* E hehehe. My bad?

But then they hear Noboyukie's voice yelling from the distance at Tenchi's
house.
"Hey somebody gotta explain this!"

Southi:Oh Oh.Here Tenchi*hands Tenchi the bat*
BoomBoi:Quick scramble!
Ping:Every man for himself!
Southi:Naw lets just haul it!
Tenchi:^_^'.............

The four ran into the forest untill Tench couldn't see them.All the sudden
he hears somebody's voice"So it was you Tenchi"Said Noboyuki walking up to
Tenchi.Tenchi puts the bat behind his back as if he had nothing to do with
it.

Tenchi:^_^' Um eh heheehee Its a funny story dad would you like to hear it?

                             EPISODE 2

                        NO NEED FOR BASEBALL

~~~~~~~~~2 hours later

Tenchi is in his bedroom getting ready for school.Tenchi puts on his black
school uniform and then looks at the mirror and started to button up his
shirt.He went downstairs to the living where he see's Ping and the three
sitting on the couch watching music videos.

Boomboi:Off to school?
Tenchi:Yep..
Southi:Hey yo Tenchi sorry about that.I think your father knows I'm gonna
pay him back.
Tenchi:Don't worry he's not that mad.Just as long you pay him.
Southi:We cool?
Tenchi:Yeah
Southi:Aight then*gives Tenchi some daps*
Tenchi:Hey do you guys wanna watch me play baseball at the school?Its the
finals.
Jyun:Aight sure.Whats the address?
Tenchi:Here*gives Jyun a small card*
Jyun:*reads it out loud*For more information call the assistant princapal or

Ping:Hey!Aren't ya gonna invite Ryoko,Ayeka and the others?
Tenchi:Uhhh I don't think so....Cause if they go things are gonna...
Ping:We know what you mean.Well see you after school.
Tenchi:Allright bye.Oh and try to keep it.How do you say?Down low.
P,S,B,&J:*starts singing*Keep it on DL DL.
Tenchi:Ha hahahaa I'll see you guys later.

Tenchi left the room.While Tenchi was leaving the room Ryoko ghostly stuk
her head through the wall and looks around.The four dosen't know she was
there."Hmmmm"she said to her self.Then she teleports herself in front of
Tenchi who was still walking the path that leads to town.

Tenchi:Yahhhh!Ryoko!You scared me!
Ryoko:Tenchi can you please let me go to the game pleeeeaase.
Tenchi:No every time you go some where with me there's trouble.
Ryoko:I'll be good please I'll be good.*puts arm around Tenchi*
Tenchi:No Ryoko and thats final!*Takes Ryoko's arm and then puts it behind
her back*I'll see you after the game!
Ryoko:Noooo..Tenchi me and you are destined together!Why must you break my
heart?
Tenchi:Now don't try to make me feel bad.I'll see you after the game.

Tenchi left to go to school.A sad look came upon Ryoko's face while he was
walking away.After a few hours the Ping,Southi,Boomboi,and Jyun got ready to
leave"Hey we'll see you later pops"Southi said leaving out to the
door."Hahahaha rute for Tenchi all the Way"Grampa said to the leaving
four.High up in the air Ryoko was in the sky hovering above the walking
four."All I have to do is follow them"she's says to herself.

~~~~~~~~At the school baseball game..

The base ball field was shape like a diamond with big tall fences
surrounding it.Thousands of bleechers were place around it where hundreds of
fans sit and watch.The red uniform baseball men were the dragons and it
appears they were the home team.The others were the visiting team.They were
wearing blue uniforms they were known as the serpents.Tenchi was on the
dragons team.Ping,Southi,Boomboi and Jyun took their seats in the front row
by Tenchi's dug out.

Southi:Hey whats that over there yo?
BoomBoi:*Sets his eyes*I think its a dragon.
Southi:That ain't no dragon!More like an ox.
Jyun:Naw man its a dog.
Southi:No it isn't!Its an ox!
Jyun:No its a dog!
Ping:Quiet!Lets watch the game.Aight!

While Tenchi was practicing his batting in the white circle by the dug out
when four big baseball players from the serpent side came by Tenchi and
started to insult him."Hey look at that over there"Jyun said to Ping.The
four walked up to the fence near Tenchi where it kept the four baseball
teammates and the four friends seperated.

BoomBoi:Hey! You mess with him you mess with us.
Southi:Yeah are you ready to step up to this?*Puts out both of his arm*
BoomBoi:So c'mon say some more stuff huh?
Jyun:Why don't you guys come out here and say some stuff?

The four teamates look at them,look at each other,look back,and then rolled
their eyes.Then they trotted off.

Jyun:I got the guy on the far left their yo.
BoomBoi:You say whatever I'm gonna bury them all.
Ping:You allright Tenchi?
Tenchi:Yeah.Thanks.
Ping:Oh and good luck!Ya heard!

They began the base ball game the dragons were doing okay at the beggining
but then the serpents began to get back at them.The score was set from 11 to
25.

Ping:Hey yo whats the score?
Jyun:11 to 25
Ping:Hey Tenchi's doing pretty good there.
Jyun:What do you mean?11 is Tenchi's team score.
Southi:Man we got to do something to rute them on.C'mon how about we do the
wave.
BoomBoi:How about....Noooooooo...And get your hand outta mah popcorn!Dofus.

High up in the  in the air Ryoko was hovering above watching the whole
game."Man there not doing to good"she said herself then she notices a man
with a gymbag bag arguing with the coach she listens to them carefully.

Man: WHAT DO YOU MEAN I YELL TOO MUCH!!!
Coach:I mean you yell too much.
Man:THAT'S IT YOU FAT LARD!!I QUIT *throws down gymbag*
Coach:I can fine other third baseman's!
Ryoko:Man that guy has an attitude.....

Suddenly Ryoko started to get a troublesome thought."Hmmmm"she said still
hovering in the air.

Another basemen from Tenchi's team grabs the bat from it rack and walks up
to the plate.He had green long hair going down from the cap and kept the hat
bill down foward so nobody could see his face.When the guy  pitch the ball
the green hair player quickly grands slams it.
"Daaaaaaaannnnnggg!"Ping,Southi,BoomBoi,and Jyun yelled while the ball went
over the fence.The crowd goes wild Tenchi notices this and then looks out in
the field."Hey that guys not bad."one player said.

Tenchi:Wait a sec he looks like Ryoko.

Tenchi notices the green hair player running the base and slaps one of the
other player's hats off.

Tenchi:And he acts like Ryoko.*looks again*That is Ryoko!

When Ryoko came back to the dug out,she see's Tenchi's arm's cross and was
looking straight at her in an angry expression."Ryoko!"Tenchi finally said.

Ryoko:Who me?Who's Ryoko?
Tenchi:Enough monkey buisness!
Ryoko:Hey now I'm no monkey*Puts cap bill down foward even more*

The coach comes by and say's to Tenchi"C'mon Tenchi your up!"

Tenchi:I am?
Ryoko:^_^Yep.Good luck.*slaps Tenchi in the butt*Keepin ya team spirit up.
Tenchi:Hey!*walks off*
Coach:*backs away*Look dude keep your team spirit to yourself.

 ~~~~~~~~~30 minutes of gameplay has pass and the score was set from 37-25

BoomBoi:Well look at that yo!Were doing pretty good.
Southi:Yeah thanks to that green hair dude.
Ping:.........
Southi:Whats the matter?
Ping:I could've sworn that was Ryoko.
Jyun:Hey man don't be crazy on me.

Ryoko bats the ball and it goes into another homerun,while she was running
to the third base she got tripped by an angry player.While she fell the cap
fell off revealing her face."Wait a second your a girl"the player said."Yep
thats correct.Here's what you won!"She uppercauts the guy and the guy flew
over the tall fence where he then landed in the concession stand.One of the
other players grab a hold of Ryoko and then another comes by to help
him.Tenchi quickly runs out to field to help Ryoko.

Ping:It is Ryoko lets go help her!!
Jyun:Awww yeahhhh look!
Ping:Well I be dang.

The four notices the same four serprent players out in the field.

Southi:*Cracks nuckles*He heheehe lets go bust some heads.
Ping:Wait!Look!
Jyun:This is too much!Ha hahaha

It appears that the whole team from both sides were out in the field
fighting it out.Soon the fans ran out there to help.

Southi:All right!
Boomboi:Lets get them!

They quickly climbed over the tall the fence and ran towards the fight.

Ping:Were almost there!
BoomBoi:Take me out to the ball game indeed!
Jyun:When I get through with them their gonna need the best doctor in Japan
to get mah shoe out of them.

~~~~~~~~~Later that night at the Masaki house.

Sasami was cooking dinner and Ryo-oki was helping her. Kiyone was pacing
back and fourth in the living room waiting for Ping.

Kiyone:Where is he?There's only thirty minutes untill his shift.I still have
a higher rank then he does I could just order him to stay here.
Mihoshi:^_^Oh don't worry you know Ping is always on time.
Kiyone:Yeah I guess your right.*sits down*

Suddenly Ayeka runs into the room yelling.

Ayeka:Where is Ryoko!?Where is she!
Mihoshi:Whats the matter?
Ayeka:I can't fine Ryoko.
Sasami:*from Kitchen*Thats something to hear coming out of somebody who

Kiyone:Why do you need to find Ryoko?
Ayeka:Cause I can't fine Tenchi and Tenchi would be home at this time!What

Ayeka:Why?Is Ping and those guys gone too?
Kiyone:(_ _)*sigh*Yep.

They hear the door open and close.Tenchi,Ryoko,and the four came in with
