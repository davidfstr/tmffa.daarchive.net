By Ryouko's Twin (bunny@btclick.com)

O.k. Tenchi and all related characters e.t.c belong to Pioneer and A.I.C
So there is no need to sue!!!
WARNING:This has swearing words in it

Ryouko looked wistfully at the water, thinking about Tenchi
"But who will get him in the end?"She said frustratedly.
She had always thought she had a good chance, but these days there was so
much more competition. Even WASHU had become a possible candidate.
Imagine if it was Washu, "Poor Tenchi!" or Aeka, yuck!!!
If it was Aeka she'd be constantly reminding him to stick out his little
finger when drinking tea, and Washu would constantly be in a lab.
"Hey! What if Washu could find out who Tenchi's future is!!!"
Feeling happier, she went to see Washu.
A week later, all the girls went to see what Washu had come up with.
She had a computer chip, the gang (who had shaken off Tenchi) were very
pleased.
Washu turned on the computer and had a look.
"Right" she said
"Tenchi is going to marry.....no-one."
"WHAT!" The gang all said in unison
"How can that be?" said Ryouko
"You blew him up."
"ME!!! I would never blow Tenchi up!!!!!"
"Well, you and Aeka did. Fighting **AGAIN** over him."
"WHAT!!!!" Said Aeka
"Aeka, you killed Tenchi!" Said Sasami, crying
"You know it was probably mostly Ryouko's fault!!!!" said Aeka
Ryouko and Aeka prepared to attack
"You know it's fights like this that are going to be the death of Tenchi.
Literally!!" Said Washu
"Well. For Tenchi's sake I think we can call a truse." Said Ryouko, sticking
out her hand, Aeka shook it
"Yes. But on the terms that its for Tenchi."Said Aeka
"We're not freinds." Said Ryouko clearly regretting that she had sugested
it.
"If it wasn't for Tenchi i'd still be burning your head."
"Yeh, dream on!"
"Soooooo, you two are actually going to be FREINDS!" Said Mihoshi
Ryouko and Aeka turning (Daggers at Mihoshi)
"NO!!!!" They both said
They walked out the room. Ryouko purposly walked the other way to avoid
walking with Aeka, but had to double back when she realised she couldn't get
out that way.
After everyone but Washu had departed, Washu muttered "God, i'm a genious."
she said, removing the fake disk and inserting the real one. Smiling at the
change she'd just made to the future....
