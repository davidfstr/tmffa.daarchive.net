this is just the best way to tell the story! ^_^)

Continues past the events in Chapter 1----------------------------- (I 
have to say that or I get confused ..... )  
  
Ryoko: Ok, (Shivering a little) I feel cold, is the temperature 
dropping that quick? 
Kiyone: I'll scan and see (I held the scanner, moving from one side to 
the other, and confirming the  
temperature drop) We'd better start a fire, I'll heat this stone there 
with a energy blast from my laser  
pistol. It will keep us warm for the night. 
Tenchi: Why don't we group together as we sleep, will keep each other 
warm. (He then suggest a  
spooning position, with Tenchi, sandwiching Ryoko between him and me. 
He wants to make sure  
Ryoko and the baby got through the night well, I agreed.  
As we drifted to sleep I kept thinking of their proposal to be the 2nd 
future Empress of Jurai. I kept  
thinking above all, what will Mihoshi do if I did go through with it? 
With this thought I fell into an  
uneasy sleep, praying that I would have an answer to this  and our 
other problems. 
***********************************************************************
*************************** 
As morning dawns sending a shaft of light into the cave sheltering us, 
it hits me right on my face waking me up. I then scan the area with the 
one scanner that seems to work through this dampening field, I then 
sense that this field is not natural, but man-made. I make a note to 
investigate this further when I feel a hand on my shoulder. Tenchi was 
waking up and squeezed my shoulder, then he pointed to his wife, my 
friend Ryoko still quietly snoring between us. I smile and look at him. 
Oh I do know my feelings for him, but until we can get out of this 
planet, it will have to wait. 
Tenchi: (Whispering) I think she'll sleep some more, why don't we 
gather some wood to cook breakfast. 
Kiyone: OK, I also need to talk to you about something, OK? 
Tenchi: OK! He nodded 
As we make our way around the area gathering wood for the fire, I start 
speaking to Tenchi; 
Kiyone: I think the dampening field is man made, I scanned and got a 
hit on my sensors at one of the places that we detected water before. 
Tenchi: Ok, what do you want to do about it? 
Kiyone: With all the intrigue at the Jurai Council, I think we're in a 
trap.  You and Ryoko are both in danger. 
Tenchi: With our powers effectively nullified, we would make much 
easier targets for assassins, I do agree with you. What do you want me 
to do? 
Kiyone: You know I would go to knock out this field, but I think I need 
to be here to protect Ryoko, you have more skills with the sword. With 
this field effecting Jurai's power and equipment, you might have a 
better chance at finishing off whom ever is at the dampening field 
emitter, While I can be more effective here! Is that OK with you Ten-
chan? 
Tenchi: (With a smile as I used that term of endearment) I think it's a 
plan, after breakfast, we'll need to inform Ryoko, and I'll help set 
the defenses up then, I'll get going. (He then comes up and gives me a 
hug, I return the hug with earnest.) 
***********************************************************************
*************************  
  
Ryoko: I wonder how he's doing (looking very worried!) 
Kiyone: (I grab her shoulders and squeeze) He's been trained by Yousho, 
and even without his powers, he'll be OK! 
Ryoko: (Calming down) I know your right, it's just I finally have all 
I've ever wanted, now to be helpless  and he's going into danger, I 
can't lose him, you know I just can't! (She slowly starts to shiver, I 
throw a blanket over her shoulders and hold her as she cries, I keep 
telling her, no one will harm him, or her and this baby will be born 
without anyone threatening it. Even if they have to go through me 
first! (I said with conviction. This causes her to stop crying and hug 
me as a way of her telling me she has confidence in me!) 
***********************************************************************

 The two assassins made their way towards the life signs that they were 
viewing on their scanners, then they split up as one life sign was 
moving away from the other two. 
assassin #1:  I'll go after the loner, he seems to be heading towards 
the Dampening field generator. 
assassin #2: that leaves the Two in the cave. Well, that will be easy, 
already cornered and ready for slicing & dicing! He smiles with 
anticipation. 
assassin #1: I'll bet it's the Prince going after the generator, I did 
want a challenge, and I guess I'm going to get it. 
assassin #2: Which means that the pregnant Princess is open for attack, 
with just that Female GP to guard her, this will be a snap! 
As the assassins made their way to their targets a Jurian tree ship was 
making it's way toward the desert Planet Skavala. On it was the 
Empress, her husband,  Detective Mihoshi, Princess Sasami, and The 
Great Scientist Washu.  
 All had found out the plot to kill off Tenchi, and Ryoko. With the 
help of Jurian Intelligence, Rengo and the plotters on Jurai were found 
out and arrested. There was now a race against time to save their 
friends and family . 
As Tenchi made his way towards a square shaped object, a lone figure 
stalked him from behind. Tenchi sensed this and knew he was about to be 
attacked. He also knew that if he could destroy the dampening field 
generator, he could use his Jurai powers once again. He also knew that 
without his powers he would have to depend on the sword he had gotten 
as a present from his grandfather and not be able to use Tenchi-ken. As 
he came with in 5 meters of the object the assassin (#1) struck, 
launching an attack from Tenchi's rear, he countered it with hs sword, 
the parried to and fro as they fought around the object. Each time 
Tenchi lunged for the object the assassin (dressed in all black, like a 
Ninja) kept him at bay and away from the object.  "If only I had even a 
single burst of energy, I could blow the generator up!" thought Tenchi 
as he fought harder to get to the object. The assassin for his part 
kept thwarting Tenchi's every move, while not getting hurt or injured 
which was the assassin's objective. Then all things changed, in the 
distance there was a loud cry, a female cry, of someone in pain, Tenchi 
lost all reserve and slowly a power build up inside of him, that no 
scientifically made dampening field could hold back, and with one hand 
he built up a blue energy ball and flung it at the object. The assassin 
knew if that energy ball found it's mark it was the end for him, 
knowing this he flung himself away from in front of the ball with sword 
in front.  As this was happening, Tenchi launched himself in the air, 
over the assassin and landed behind him, he then put his sword through 
the assassin. Then jumped back as the ball went through what was left 
of the assassin, hit and destroyed the generator. The blast sent Tenchi 
about 30 meters away. he landed hard, but within seconds his powers 
came back and with the newly formed light hawk wings, he flew towards 
the cave where the scream had originated. He fought back tears at the 
thoughts that were racing through his head, "If Kiyone was the one, or 
maybe a weakened Ryoko, and the baby, Oh Gods, I've got to hurry". and 
what greeted Tenchi when he got there stunned even him! 
***********************************************************************
************************* 
Just as Tenchi had reached the Generator; 
Kiyone was holding a shaking Ryoko, her water had broken and she was in 
labor 
Kiyone: Ryoko, how far along are the contractions? 
Ryoko: About a minute between eaaaaccchhh, Ahhhouuu (Even through a 
contraction, Ryoko kept as quiet as possible knowing that they had 
company). 
Kiyone: I have to go find that assassin out there, I'm leaving you my 
long Knife, if he gets past me...... 
Ryoko: (Looking desperately at Kiyone) I know, just don't let him, and 
come back alive OK! 
Kiyone: OK, Ryo-chan (that term of endearment brought a brief smile to 
Ryoko's face, when another contraction hit) I'll stay here until this 
one's over. 
Ryoko: (through gritted teeth), No go I don't want him too close now, 
please! 
Kiyone: OK I'll be back soon! (With that she snuck out a side entrance 
to the cave hoping to surprise her assailant.  
She knew how to defend herself, but she knew she wasn't going to arrest 
this perpetrator, she might have to kill him to save Ryoko and the 
baby. She knew this and kept her eyes open. 
The assassin (#2) saw the ploy and came up behind Kiyone as she was 
about to attack, when a well placed back kick to the groin area 
momentarily made him collapse. She then faced her would be attacker and 
was ready for his next move. The assassin then smiled, drew out a 
blaster and calmly shot at Kiyone, as she ducked it made a circular 
hole through her lower abdomen. As she fell she threw a standard issue 
GP knife and as the assassin got up to admire his work his forehead met 
the knife, consequently he fell dead on the ground, next to a now hurt 
Kiyone.  As Kiyone staggered her way towards the cave a gigantic scream 
was heard from it (It might be another assassin, oh no, Ryoko, she ran 
in with the blaster in hand when she saw a stunning site. 
***********************************************************************
************************** 
As Kiyone was wrapping the baby in a blanket, Tenchi flew in on his 
light hawk wings. as he saw his daughter for the first time. He landed 
and headed towards Kiyone and the baby. He was overjoyed. He then saw 
his wife and wife to be. Ryoko looked exhausted, but Ok, but Kiyone 
looked rather white and pale, then Tenchi saw the hole on her side.  
she handed the baby to him and collapsed from loss of blood. A thought 
had occurred to him, maybe her Jurian half would react to the healing 
of the light hawk wings.  Tenchi then went to Ryoko, kissed her and 
handed her their daughter. He brought his wings up and gently wrapped 
his three wings around a now floating Kiyone. As they started to glow, 
Kiyone passed out, then started to glow as well. As a stunned Ryoko 
watched while nursing her daughter, Kiyone's wound started to heal. 
With in the 20 seconds that the light hawk wings had wrapped around 
her, Kiyone was completely healed.  
When the wings dispersed. Tenchi sank to his knees exhausted, Kiyone 
slowly floated down and laid on the ground. Then something strange 
happened, as Kiyone lay unconscious two light hawk wings erupted from 
her and floated above her until she started regaining consciousness, 
they then disappeared. Both Ryoko and Tenchi would have to talk to her 
about this later. 
***********************************************************************
************** 
Kiyone: Oh that was great, Thanks Ten-chan (Both now holding hands) Why 
don't you go say hello to your new daughter. Tenchi made his way 
towards a nursing Ryoko, he kissed her on the forehead and then waved 
Kiyone to come join them, as they admired the baby.  
   
Ryoko: Tenchi, lets name her Achika, OK? 
Tenchi: Oh, that would be great, My mother would be so proud of both of 
you, you proved to me that you are the perfect choices for being my 
wives. (Both girls smiled, as five other people suddenly beamed into 
the cave).  
It was Washu, Ayeka, Sagami, Mihoshi & Sasami 
Washu was first by her daughter's side scanning her, and then the 
baby.  She then scanned Tenchi and Finally Kiyone. All the others 
surrounded the three survivors. 
Washu: Hey, how come you have emanations of Jurai power coming from you 
Kiyone? 
Kiyone: That's because Tenchi used his Jurai Light hawk wings to heal 
my wound (She pointed to the newly healed scar that was once a 4 inch 
wide hole). (Tenchi then whispered something to Washu, she then knodded 
in agreement, noting she will have to talk to Kiyone as well.) 
Mihoshi: Gee, Kiyone did you shoot yourself or what?? 
Kiyone: No, Mihoshi, that assassin there did (pointing to the now dead 
corpse of the 2nd assassin) 
Ayeka: The plot to kill all of you and dethrone the Jurai Royal Family 
was thwarted. All of you are now safe. 
As they all gathered to be beamed up Ryoko asked Tenchi; 
Ryoko: Should we continue to Megami, I think we already know Kiyone's 
answer. 
Tenchi: We should still see her mother, she has a right to know why she 
left Jurai, also we need to talk to her about those two light hawk 
wings as well. 
So, the ship made it's way to Megami, and Kiyone's answers to her tough 
questions!  
  
Final chapter coming up, be ready for more fics coming soon.
