This is a multi-part series.

Hi this is my first fan fiction.
I don't totally agree with what happens in the series so
Here is my fan fiction. 
Here are some pointers:
1) I am a huge Ryoko fan, so it’s obvious who is going to get Tenchi,
I don't want to hurt any other fan of Aeka's I just think Ryoko should get Tenchi.

Ok on to the fan fiction:

--------------------------------

Chapter 1: "The Beginning"

--------------------------------

Tenchi is in his bedroom and he stirs..
He opens his eyes and sees Ryoko.

"R..R..Ryoko, what are you doing here, could you please give me some privacy," Tenchi said.

"Tenchi-chan, come on, breakfast is ready," Ryoko said sweetly.

"Ok, now could you please go?," Tenchi asked.

"Why should I Tenchi-chan," Ryoko asked.

"I need to get dressed that’s why!!" Tenchi answered.
<why does she always add a -Chan to my name? Why me? --_--; >

"I'll see you downstairs, Tenchi-chan!," Ryoko said as she dematerializes.

--------------------------------

Tenchi is on his way to the kitchen.

"Umm..that smells good Sasami." Tenchi said nicely.

"Thank You, Tenchi, this morning is my Super Sasami Special. Tell
me what you think." Sasami said.

"Smells good, but what’s in it?" Tenchi said.

"Oh, it is a surprise. I know everyone will enjoy it." Sasami said.

--------------------------------

"Mihoshi!! Wake up we'll be late for breakfast!!" screamed Kiyone.
She looked at Mihoshi's expression.

<How can Mihoshi be so carefree?> Kiyone was thinking.

Mihoshi started waking up gradually.
"Kiyone, quit shaking me" Mihoshi said.

"Hurry up and get dressed, or we'll be late for breakfast" Kiyone said.

"Food, umm, oh goodie" Mihoshi said.
She woke up and got changed in a jiffy.

<Why me?> Kiyone was thinking.

Both Mihoshi and Kiyone came down together.
Mihoshi now looks up and alert and ready for food. 

--------------------------------
Washu's lab...

Ryoko materializes in Washu's lab.

"Washu, breakfast is ready." Ryoko said.

"Little Ryoko, what have I told you to call me?" Washu said.

"Give me a good reason and I will," Ryoko said.

"If you don't I will tell Tenchi your deep and most hidden secret" Washu said.

Ryoko went a little pale.
<I have no choice>

"*MOM* breakfast is ready." Ryoko said with annoyance in her voice.

"See that’s more like it, now lets go to breakfast?" Washu said.

--------------------------------

Now everyone was at the table eating.

"So everyone what do you think?" Sasami questioned.

"Its good Sasami" Tenchi announced.

"Sasami, this is wonderful" Aeka said with sincerity in her voice.

"Thank You so much Sasami." Mihoshi said.

"Well, Sasami I must say this is good" Ryoko said.

Everyone else just said. "It's great!"

"Thank You for the comments, everyone." Sasami said.

Suddenly Ryoko latched on to Tenchi.

"Hey, you monster, stay off Tenchi" Aeka said.

"I don't see why I should let a little Princess like you order me around" Ryoko said.

"I am NOT *little*" Aeka screamed.

<Again..please not again> Tenchi thought.

Ryoko started charging her energy ball.
Aeka started charging her force field.

"NO, Not in the house. Can't you two control yourselves?" Tenchi questioned.

Both girls started at Tenchi with a face saying, "No Way"

They quietly got up and left the house to continue the battle.

"Kiyone, lets go watch, can we please???"Mihoshi whined

"Ok, Mihoshi just quit whining." Kiyone said.
<Actually I do want to know who wins...this time>

"I guess, I'll join" Washu said.

Washu, Kiyone, and Mihoshi then looked at Tenchi.

Tenchi formed a classic anime sweat drop.
"Ok, I guess I don't have an option." Tenchi said in a defeated voice.

They all went to the field, which was now all ready for battle.

------------------------------------- 

"Ready LITTLE princess!" Ryoko said.

"Ready MONSTER" Aeka.

They charged at each other.
Ryoko took one of her energy balls and shot it at Aeka's force field.
It went trough with ease and blast the princess off her feet.
Ryoko started coming in with her light saber.
Aeka got up just in time to block it.

Ryoko then did some quick teleporting as Aeka shot at her.
Finally Aeka had pretty much had used up all her energy.
Ryoko came in again with her saber.
Aeka blocked it and she took an energy ball in her other hand and shot
it at Ryoko's waist. 
Luckily for Ryoko she teleported in time. But part of the blast got to her and she
was injured on her waist. 
Aeka did not see this.
She tried her best to hold a force field.
But Ryoko broke that. 
Next thing you see Aeka is defeated.

Ryoko won. But no one knows about her waist.

The two rivals separate and at dinner no one talks.
Ryoko amazingly doesn't gloat about her victory.
Aeka is just a little put down, but she vows revenge on Ryoko.

Everyone else is quiet. No one talks about the day’s events.

Dinner is over and everyone departs to his/her room.
Ryoko heads to the top of the roof.
Tenchi sees this and wonders what is wrong.
He decides it's best if he went to bed

--------------------------------------
On the roof of the house...

Ryoko sat holding her waist.

<How could I have let her hit me?>

<What’s wrong Ryoko?> Washu was communicating with Ryoko through their link.

<Why do you always look into my thoughts?> Ryoko questioned.

<Well it is mother's duty> Washu said.

<As a daughter I request privacy.> Ryoko said.

<Suit yourself> Washu said.
way in the back of Washu's mind she thought,
<I know something is wrong!> She typed on her laptop
<Oh...now I know, poor Ryoko>

--------------------------------------

In the bushes a little away from Ryoko...

RED eyes flared.

Ryoko did not notice this.

after having the conversation with her mother through their link,
she dematerializes into her room.

--------------------------------------
End of Chapter.

Well so what do you think do you want me to continue?
E-mail me.
It all depends on that.

I am asking for responses because I want to know if people
are actually reading these things.
