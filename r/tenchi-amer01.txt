				Tenchi in America.

	Hello everyone I thought of this story during the time when I was writeing 
EXTREAM VOL.5. It stars Tenchi Masaki and the rest as they get zapped from the 
anime world into the real American world thanks to one of Washus inventions. 
They also meet the true Michael not to be confused with the Extream version of 
Michael this takes place in Texas on the outskirts of Houston.

	The Characters don't belong to me they belong to AIC and Pioneer. Except 
Michael he belongs to me.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Washus Lab. January Second 2000.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"It's completed! My Diminsional doorway is finished!" Washus yelled 

	"What's finished?" Ayeka asked walking into the lab.

	"Top Secret stuff."Washu said

	"I'll tell you all about it at Dinner time." Washu said

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Later that evening at Dinner.(Yeah kind of fast.)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	"May I have everyones attention please. I finished my Dimensional doorway 
into the real world." Washu said

	"Real world? But I thought this was the real world." Sasami asked

	"Not really were just Anime Characters created to entertain our fans." 
Washu said

	"Wait there's people watching our every moves?" Ryoko asked

	"About 2 million." Washu told the space pirate.

	Everyone looks toward you. 

	"Well how many people beleave me?" Washu asked

	No one put there hand up.

	"Well Walk through this doorway and I'll activate it." Washu said 

	"Do you thank we should bring Mayuka with us?" Tenchi asked

	"Yes she's your kid right?" Washu asked

	"Yes just let me get her up from her nap." Tenchi said

	Mayuka is 3 years old in this time line.

	"Well you all ready?" Washu asked

	"What does this do?" Mihoshi asked

	"Hey you don't touch that button!" Washu and Kyone said at the same time.
 
	Too late Mihoshi pressed the Texas location button.

	Everyone was sent to the real world.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Texas Cut and Shoot.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


	"Moo! Moo!" A Cow said

	"Unhh Were are we?" Tenchi asked
	
	"I have no clue." Kyone said

	Everyone ran onto a desserted road.

	"Geeze we need to be more careful." Tenchi said

	"Really I thank that guy was running after us with a gun." Kyone said
	
	"Hey there's a nice little conveniance store over there." Ayeka pointed

the sign.

	"Howdy ya'll. Come on in and make yeself at home." An elderly woman said.

	"Well I'm going to look for a map." Tenchi said walking into the store.

Cabbit.

	"Yes mem will she be okay outside?" Ryoko asked.

	"If she's a cat? yes." The woman said
	
	Across the room they saw what appeared to be a Teenaged boy yelling at his 
Father.

	"Why did we have to move to hicksville U.S.A. for?" The boy yelled.

	"Well we've been robbed 5 times in Houston and I don't want to be robbed 
anymore." The boy's father said

	"No excuse. I'll be waiting outside." The boy said walking outside.

	"Geeze he must not like it here?" Ryoko said

	"I don't blame him. No Technology except for a phone and electricity." 
Washu said

	"Hmm maybe I should talk to him." Ayeka asked

	"Well I figured out where we're at." Tenchi said

	"Where?" The group asked

	"The United States of America and we are in the state of Texas." Tenchi 
said

	"Where's Ayeka going?" Tenchi asked

	"Going outside to talk to some boy." Ryoko said

	"Dadda I hungry." Mayuka said

	"Dinner well be here soon." Tenchi said

	"I wonder if the'll take YEN?" Tenchi said looking at his wallet.

	"Wow what a coincidince." Michael said

	"Yeah what ever." Ryoko said

	"So tell me a little about yourself  Michael." Tenchi said

	''Well I was born on December 29, 1980. Sadly my mother died five weeks 
after I was born. She always wanted a baby boy for so many years. Here's a 
picture of my Mother." Michael said as he handed a picture to Tenchi.

	"I'm still in High School until I'm 21." Michael said
	
	"That's about it." Michael said

	"Than I moved out here with my Buttheaded dad." Michael said sighing.

	"Time to go son." Michael dad said.

	"Hey dad I got a favor to ask of you." Michael said

	Michael asked if his new friends could stay for a while.

	"Come on dad. Have a heart. Remember what the good book says. "Always love 
thy neighbor." Michael said

	"Well okay but I don't know how Grandma can cook all that food." Michael's
