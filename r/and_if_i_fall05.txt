     Yosho sat at his desk in the shrine office, addressing the endless list of documents 
and correspondence that seemed to come with his position.  You would think a priest would 
spend his time sitting and meditating on the higher aspirations of life.  Such was not the 
case, however.  He shook his head ruefully.  There was a knock on his office door, which 
surprised him -- it was still snowing outside.  Who would bundle-up just to visit his office
in this weather?  "Come in."
     Ayeka entered and closed the door behind her, brushing snow off of her cloak and 
shedding her boots.  Yosho admired her graceful movements, and watched silently as she made 
herself comfortable.
     She studied her half-brother discreetly.  He had not restored his facade, and his 
youthful face was slightly tilted to the side.  His arms were folded, patiently waiting for 
her.  She seated herself in the guest chair.
     "What do you need, Little Sister, that would bring you out in such miserable weather?"
     "I wanted to talk to you privately," she replied.
     Yosho turned to the ever-present teapot, placing two cups on the table and filling them 
slowly.  "It must be about something very important."
     "It is important -- to me."  She accepted the cup and warmed her hands around it.  "What 
was she like, Yosho?"
     "You mean Itsuki?"
     Ayeka nodded, sipping her tea.
     Yosho had been expecting this conversation, sooner or later.  He rose quietly and 
entered his quarters, returning moments later with a framed photograph, which he handed to 
her.  He settled back into his chair while she examined the photo.  It was a formal portrait, 
taken over a century earlier.  She recognized Yosho, even looking humorless and composed in 
his robes.  Next to him sat an apple-cheeked beauty with deep dimples, almond-shaped eyes, 
and long, lustrous hair.  Where Yosho managed to convey an austere dignity, she gave the 
image of restrained mirth.  Her eyes twinkled, and the corners of her lips rose ever so 
slightly.  They sat very close together.
     "She was lovely," Ayeka said, returning the photo to him.
     "Yes, she was.  She liked to cook, and sing, and play practical jokes on people.  She 
was much like Sasami."  He placed the photo on the table, adjusting it so they could both 
view it.
     "How did you meet her?"
     "I was wandering the southern islands, performing various errands, when I sensed her 
Power.  She had sensed mine, too, so it came as a pleasant surprise for both us when we 
finally met.  We were married less than a year later."
     "Did you ever tell her about your past?  Did she know who you are?"
     "Yes," he replied slowly.  "At first she didn't believe any of it.  It wasn't until I 
showed her Ryoko's crypt that she finally accepted the truth.  We had many long discussions 
about it."
     "Did she ever express any interest in visiting Jurai?"  Ayeka sipped her tea,
alternating her gaze between Yosho and the photograph.
     "None whatsoever.  She was happy living in this valley.  I often wondered how Father 
persuaded Mother to leave this planet, what arguments he used.  Had she wanted to go, I 
would have figured out some way to accomplish it."  He shrugged.  "Perhaps she would still 
be alive."
     "But Tenchi would not," she replied.  "Your daughter never would have met Nobuyuki."
     "That is true."
     "Did Itsuki know about *us*?" Ayeka asked, watching his eyes.
     "Yes."
     "Didn't it concern her -- or you -- that you were breaking a betrothal bond?"
     "Yes, for a while.  The passing years had a way of diluting that concern, however.  We 
assumed that my absence would have been accepted, and adjustments made."
     Ayeka was silent for awhile, lost in thought.  Yosho refilled their cups while waiting 
for her response.  Finally, she said, "You must miss her very much."
     "As much as you would miss Tenchi, if he fails to emerge from his cocoon."
     "Do you still feel he should not sit on the throne?"
     Yosho shrugged.  "He is very compassionate, very honorable, and very brave.  But 
politics has a way of sullying a person's character, of corrupting their morals.  With his 
high ideals, I'm afraid he could be very vulnerable to the darker elements.  He lacks your 
trained instincts and skeptical demeanor."
     Ayeka raised one eyebrow.  "I don't know whether to take that as a compliment or an 
insult."
     "It was an observation," Yosho replied.  "A personal assessment.  Perhaps with you 
there to advise him --"
     "I would have been your advisor, too," she interrupted softly.
     Yosho looked at her sadly.  "We were never in love, Little Sister."
     "I was."
     "But I wasn't.  Our marriage was arranged, based upon politics rather than sentiment.  
We could not have worked together."
     "I was happy with the arrangement."
     "We have discussed this before, Ayeka.  We both know that a power struggle would have 
erupted eventually.  What is really troubling you?"
     She studied her tea for a moment, hoping to discover strength or inspiration.  "I feel 
that a great karmic wheel is about to roll over me again; that both times I have fallen in 
love it was with a man who would inherit the throne, who didn't want it, and then who was 
taken from me mere months before our wedding.  I feel cursed."
     "It is an interesting coincidence," Yosho agreed, "but nothing more.  I don't believe 
you carry any curse."
     "I wish I could be as certain," she replied, looking out the window towards the lake.

     Washu found Ryoko sitting on the sofa, staring vacantly at the television.  "What's on?"
     "I dunno," Ryoko replied absently.  "I really wasn't paying attention."
     "Well, if you aren't busy, this would be a good time to continue looking for your 
trousseau."  Washu ported her dimensional keyboard over to the sofa and sat beside her 
daughter.  She placed Tenchi's monitor program into background and cleared the display.  
Fingers dancing across the keyboard, she tapped into the Internet and navigated to one of 
the search engines.
     "I'm not really in the mood, Washu."
     "I know, Ryoko.  But it will help to take your mind off of Tenchi for a while, especially 
for something he's going to appreciate.  Your wedding is the first one, and it might take me 
a while to assemble the components." 
     "Oh, alright."  Ryoko shifted across the sofa to sit beside Washu, for a better view of
the displays.
     "Did you decide on any particular style?  You were thinking about traditional Japanese 
the last time we talked, but you also saw a couple of French designs that caught your eye."
     What followed was a dispirited examination of designer websites and bridal registries.  
During the previous conversation on this topic, Ryoko had been highly animated and repeatedly 
dragged Tenchi over to the terminal to look at successive images; now, her heart simply 
wasn't in it.  But Washu persisted, knowing this distraction would ease her daughter's 
worries (and her own, if truth be told).  Finally, though, it simply ran out of steam.
     "I'm sorry, Mom, but I just can't focus on this now.  I know you're just trying to help, 
and I really appreciate the effort.  But let's do this later, ok?"
     Washu nodded and sent the keyboard back into the corner.  On one hand, she was 
disappointed that they had accomplished so little.  On the other hand, Ryoko had called her 
'Mom' and meant it -- and that in itself was worth the effort.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Mihoshi and Funaho were in the kitchen, preparing ingredients for lunch under Sasami's 
watchful eye, and exchanging frequent grins.  It was probably the brightest spot in the 
house, and for a while no one mentioned Tenchi or glanced towards the dock.  Funaho and 
Sasami had actually done this many times before, but there had been such a long interruption 
that Funaho was feeling out of practice.  Mihoshi had more recent experience, and she 
discovered that she and Funaho worked very efficiently together.  They were enjoying 
themselves.
     "Funaho, are you going to stay here for the weddings?" asked Sasami.  She was watching 
a large kettle, and was determined not to let it boil over.
     "I really don't know, Sasami.  I would like to, but there is much I should be doing at 
home.  I hadn't intended to be gone for more than a few weeks."  She stacked the vegetables 
she had been cutting into neat piles, reaching for more.
     "Well, the first one is only four weeks away -- and it takes over a week just to travel 
one way to Jurai.  You'd just have time to get there, and then you'd have to turn around and 
come right back.  Mihoshi, would you check on the rice for me?  Thanks.  It would be easier 
if you just stayed."
     "Well, I'm already imposing on your limited space...."
     "I can always go sleep in my ship, Lady Funaho, if space gets that tight."
     "I can always go sleep in my ship, too, if it comes to that."
     "In your shuttle?" Sasami asked.
     "No, my cruiser is in orbit.  There's room enough aboard for everyone.  Are there any 
more carrots over there, Mihoshi?"
     "There were a moment ago."  There was a faint "Miya!" from the doorway, and the sound 
of scampering feet.  
     "Oh, that Ryo-ohki!" Sasami scowled, looking around for the cabbit.  "I should've known 
better than to leave any sitting out.  Mihoshi, there might be some in the refrigerator, on 
the bottom shelf."
     Mihoshi giggled, and went to look.  Sasami sighed with exasperation.  "Some days..."  
She was stirring the kettle again, when a thought occurred to her.  "Funaho, if your ship is
so big, we could all travel aboard it to Mihoshi's wedding, and then on to Jurai!"
     "Well, yes, it is possible.  I think I could squeeze her ship onto my hanger deck.  
Thank you," she said to Mihoshi, who was handing her more carrots.
     "For that matter," Mihoshi said, "I could stay on board Yukinojo and just escort your 
cruiser, if there wasn't enough cabin space.  Regulations would permit that.  How finely do 
you want these cucumbers cut, Sasami?"
     "About the size of a coin.  Are Father and Mother coming to any of the weddings?"
     The smile faded from Funaho's face, and her shoulders slumped slightly.  She put the 
knife down, wiped her hands on her apron, and turned slowly towards Sasami.  Mihoshi stopped
cutting to observe.  "No, Sasami, they aren't."
     "Why not?"
     "Misaki can't come become she has to attend to her duties."  Sasami's mother was head 
of the Imperial Bodyguard, which necessitated staying full time near the Imperial Body.  
"And Lord Azusa won't come because he doesn't like Tenchi."
     Sasami stopped stirring the kettle, looking at her half-mother with a wide-eyed, hurt 
expression.  "But why?  Tenchi is his great-grandson, and these girls are so nice..."
     "I know, Sasami, I know.  Your father doesn't like Tenchi because Yosho broke tradition.  
It only got more difficult when Achika married Nobuyuki.  And Tenchi made it even worse when 
he declared his intention to marry all of you.  There has been no dishonor, but your father 
has lost 'face.'  And it really hasn't helped any that Tenchi can summon the Lighthawk 
Wings."
     "But why should that matter?"
     "Because Lord Azusa cannot.  For many generations, it has been the tradition for young 
princes to challenge their fathers for the right to rule.  When the reigning monarch can no 
longer defend his throne, then it is time for him to step down.  That is how your father 
became emperor."
     "You mean, Jurai's monarchs don't rule for life?" asked Mihoshi.
     Funaho shook her head.  "No.  That is the case with some of our neighbors, but not in 
Jurai.  And the fact of the matter is, Tenchi is strong enough right now to claim the throne.  
Lord Azusa doesn't stand a chance, and he knows it.  He's jealous, and nervous, and he's 
having to deal with some unruly barons who think this might be an ideal time to stir-up some 
trouble."  Funaho smiled, and said, "Speaking of stirring, Sasami, you should attend to your 
kettle."
     Sasami did so, but she had lost much of enthusiasm.
     "What about Ayeka's wedding?  It will be held on Jurai.  Will they even come to my 
sister's wedding?"
     "I hope so," said Funaho.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
            TUESDAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Ayeka still couldn't decide if she was cursed.
     The storm had blown itself out, leaving several inches of fresh snow that sparkled in 
the early morning sunshine.  The sky was an achingly beautiful blue, the breezes were gentle, 
and the Masaki household was infected with cabin fever.  Ayeka was one of the first to 
bundle-up and trudge down to the dock.  Her footprints crunched amidst the trampled residue 
of previous visitors, and the reflected glare from Tenchi's cocoon was blindingly bright.  
No snow clung to its surface, and it still felt warm to the touch.  She hoped this was a 
good sign.
     She was reluctant to return to the house, and her feet automatically turned towards her
private refuge -- her half-brother's Royal Tree, Funaho (christened thus to honor his mother).  
She struggled through the drifts, leaving churned snow and intermittent breath-clouds in her
wake.  Funaho's pond was frozen hard enough to support her weight, but prudence and habit 
confined her route to the stones connecting to the center isle.  She brushed snow off of her
favorite root, redistributed her cloak, and settled herself into a comfortable position.
     Funaho recognized her, emitting a friendly trill and a few beams of coherent light from
the leafless canopy above her.  Ayeka smiled warmly, and patted the root in greeting.  "Good
Morning, Funaho, I trust you are feeling well today?"  The sounds and lights modulated 
slightly, and then faded.  Ayeka sensed the great presence around her, now in a semi-dormant
state.  "Sleep well, Good Friend, I will try not to disturb you."
     Ayeka's smile melted as she considered the earlier question.  She didn't feel cursed, 
but fate had a way of dealing her some cruel ironies.  She had stumbled upon this world while 
searching for her half-brother, to whom she had been happily betrothed for many years.  
During her long sleep in stasis, he had met and married another woman, sired a daughter, who
had in turn married and sired a son of her own.  Ayeka faced a very rude awakening when she 
finally found Yosho; she had been devastated.  But, oh that grandson!  Her heart quickened 
just thinking about Tenchi, and their many quiet moments spent sitting on this very spot.  
The cruelest irony could well be facing her in the next few days: that she was doomed to 
repeat a cycle of heartbreak.
     Another whim of fate: after Yosho's disappearance, she had become first in line for the
throne.  She very much liked that idea.  She greatly enjoyed being addressed as the Crown 
Princess.  She had assiduously studied not only her father's techniques and machinations, 
but those of the successful monarchs before him.  How very ironic, then, that her successful
effort to find Yosho alive and well had resulted in her demotion.  There had been a moment 
of hope, when Yosho acknowledged that he must remain on this world, but it faded with the 
realization that the title now fell upon his grandson.  If she ever hoped to attain the 
throne, she must stand on Tenchi's corpse to reach it.
     She sighed, feeling guilty for failing to remain objective, and even more guilty at the
result of her analysis.
     Yosho had been right: had he stayed, there would have been a power struggle -- she would 
not have been content for very long to remain in his shadow.  And yet, the thought of 
assuming the same role with Tenchi did not disturb her greatly.   She could not explain the 
difference, and yet there clearly was one.  She had stated publicly that if her beloved truly 
wanted the throne she would stand aside...and now it looked like fate was going to take her 
at her word.  Well, so be it; Tenchi would need guidance, and solid advice, and who better 
to whisper those words in his ear than his own wife?  Political pillowtalk (the phrase brought 
a smile to her face) was a very old custom, indeed.  Tenchi's greatest strengths were as a 
negotiator and consensus-builder, and his reign was liable to be very prosperous and 
peaceful.  She liked the idea that history would record their rule as a beneficent one.
     Assuming he survived his present predicament, she corrected herself morosely.
     She watched the wind nudge the barren branches of the trees across the lake, sending 
clumps of soft white snow tumbling to the ground.  It seemed a good analogy of her own life: 
innocent dreams unbalanced by the winds of chance and left to hurtle into oblivion.  Her 
childhood fantasies had focused on handsome princes and daring rescues and royal weddings 
-- so far, she had accomplished two out of three.  But she should also consider her options 
if that third dream never materialized.  She only had one option, really: assume the throne 
herself (if Yosho's sole heir died, then the Line of Succession moved to Misaki's descendents).
     Suddenly, the thought of being crowned Empress lost much of its luster.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Ryoko sat on the snowy rocks outside her cave and shivered.  It wasn't the temperature 
that chilled her, since the biofield that encircled her (capable of shifting from her black 
battledress to her favorite teal housecoat to her environmental vacuum shield -- and even a 
tail when the mood suited her) had swathed her in a thermal jumpsuit.  No, the chill she 
felt was caused by the ache in her soul that no amount of insulation could protect against.
     Deep in this mountain lay the cavern, and within it the pool, that had imprisoned her 
for seven hundred years.  Yosho had placed her there, rather than killing her outright, 
sealed in the cold and dark and virtually forgotten about.  During those centuries of 
isolation, when her astral body could disengage for short times and distances, she had 
wandered across this mountainside and watched the inhabitants.  She had observed them out of
curiosity, learning their language out of boredom, and brooded away the years.  She had been
harboring her energies, slowly growing another power gem.  It would be fragile, of course, 
and modest in capabilities, but it would be sufficient to assist her escape and perhaps even
settle an old score.
     The gem was nearly complete, and her scheming had reached a fever pitch, when *he* came
into her life.
     Just an infant strapped to his mother's back, escorted later by his grandmother, he 
looked upon her astral form without blinking or cringing.  There had been no judgement in 
those eyes, and no fear, either.  And as his awareness altered with age, from visual sight 
to mental linkage, he kept returning to this cave.  To be alone with his thoughts and dreams 
and triumphs and tragedies.  And as she watched him, the bitterness in her life began to ebb, 
and she found other emotions creeping into her heart to fill the void.  Her plans began to 
change.
     And when he freed her, she was awash in emotions.  He released her in ignorance, and 
had unknowingly injured her with the tenchi-ken, and had fled in fear from her desiccated 
appearance.  She was angry, and hurt, and confused, and inexperienced, and responded the 
only way she knew how.  And even that failed her: the semi-sentient tenchi-ken retained its 
memories (along with her true gems), and not only recognized his DNA but the subconscious 
responses of an experienced fencer: she'd lost the fight and her gem as well.  And in the 
aftermath, as she waited with baited breath to see what he would do, he actually bowed and 
apologized for the pain he'd inflicted.  His eyes contained no deception, no arrogance, only
sorrow for what he'd done.  No one had ever treated her like that before.  Looking back, 
that had been the pivotal moment, the turning point, when she'd fallen in love with him.
     And now that man was trapped in a sphere of his own creation.
     And she was powerless to help.
     And she had to wonder, what would become of her if he failed his task?  What if he...died?
     Not only had the Statue of Limitations expired on her crimes, but Lady Funaho said she had 
been publicly forgiven for her sins.  She could walk down any street of any town on any planet 
in the Juraian Empire with complete freedom.  The thought actually frightened her -- she'd 
always been viewed with suspicion and fear, and treated accordingly.  The only real security
she had ever known, where she had felt welcomed and accepted, was right here.  This place had 
become her home.  And her family.  And her mind recoiled at the thought of losing them.
     Of losing *him*.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Mihoshi climbed through the woods and snowdrifts until she emerged into the meadow.  
She was panting, and vowed to ease back on Sasami's cooking and exercise a little more often.  
She wasn't worried about her figure so much as she was her readiness.  The Galaxy Police 
performed routine physicals, and anyone not maintaining established norms would get 
reassigned to a desk job.  She wanted to remain on active patrol.
     At least, in the past she had wanted to remain on active patrol.  Until Lady Funaho had
hinted that such long absences could put a strain on her upcoming marriage.  How could she 
and Tenchi build a solid relationship when she would be gone for weeks or months at a time?  
Would his feelings for her change?  Would her feelings for him change?  Even though she loved 
the GP, she loved Tenchi more, and would resign if her career got in the way.  She may be 
scatterbrained, but she wasn't stupid -- she could see and set priorities just as well as 
anyone else.
     She stood at the treeline and looked up the hill, where her ship hovered silently 
beneath its masking shield.  From beneath the cloak she could plainly see Yukinojo and the 
shadow it cast, but from above the sleek GP patrol vessel was invisible.  Yukinojo's 
architects had placed a large ventral fin in back near the engines, committing the ship to 
water docking and obviating the need for landing gear.  Fortunately, the energy required to 
keep her ship levitated was minimal.  
     Yukinojo recognized her and lowered the gangway from the rear airlock.  Huffing and 
puffing, she entered her ship.  The Artificial Intelligence greeted her perfunctorily, 
informing her that it had monitored no other traffic into this system other than Lady Funaho's 
cruiser, which was parked above them in a synchronous orbit, hiding from the locals behind a 
cloaking field of its own.  And Yukinojo had received no communications from the sector GP 
office.  If the AI had been programmed with anything more than rudimentary emotions, it would 
have expressed profound boredom.
     Mihoshi made her way to the bridge, shed her coat, and draped it over the navigation 
console.  She checked the logs to verify that everything was normal, and then dropped into 
the pilot's seat.  She opened her private computer directories and searched until she 
located the graphics file she wanted.  With a few keystrokes, she displayed on the master 
monitor the image she had sent to her parents recently.  It was a photograph of her and 
Tenchi taken last autumn by his father.  They had been sitting on the front steps, talking 
quietly, when Nobuyuki had caught them by surprise.  It was her favorite picture, and she 
had a hard copy printed and mounted down in her cabin.
     Her parents had been delighted when she'd told them about the young man she'd fallen 
in love with, and astounded when she told them his identity.  She had sworn them to secrecy, 
at least for a while, and was pretty sure that they had kept the news to themselves; but 
knowing her mother, she had probably already started making plans for the wedding.  She had 
so wanted to introduce Tenchi to them, as well as her brothers and sisters.
     She stared at the monitor for a long time, gnawing on her lip.  She was worried about 
him.  She didn't really understand what was going on, but nobody else seemed to, either -- 
and that's what scared her the most.
     "Yukinojo?"
     "Yes, Mihoshi?"
     "Can you scan that energy bubble down on the dock?"
     "Yes, Mihoshi.  It is composed of a high-frequency energy field.  It appears to be a 
containment structure, rather than a defensive shield.  I have identified the sole occupant 
as Tenchi Masaki.  He is in a reduced metabolic state, but otherwise unaffected.  Logically,
he is the source of the energy field, but I cannot locate any evidence of a portable 
generator or broadcasting device."
     "Can you locate any similar instances in your memory?"
     The AI was silent for a moment, scanning its extensive record system, before responding.  
"No, Mihoshi.  There are no corresponding entries in the registry.  However, I must remind 
you that the majority of my archival space is devoted to criminal profiles, rather than 
scientific or medical documentation."
     She sighed.  There would be no easy answers.  Down in the house, the concern for Tenchi's 
safety was palpable.  There was a genuine (if unspoken) fear that he might not emerge alive 
from that bubble.  And she had to face the fact that he might be gone from her life forever.  
Her career would absorb her grief, of course, just as it had when Kiyone disappeared.  Just 
one more scar on her heart, and probably another mark on her service record -- somehow, it 
would be her fault.  As usual.
     Maybe she really was jinxed. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Washu retreated to her lab.  There was a special place she reserved for just such 
moments, when she faced an overwhelming problem or the all-too-frequent need to be alone.  
She went to her observatory
     The room was small, just big enough to contain a desk, a chair, a computer terminal, 
and a wall-mounted video display.  The desktop contained a collection of 2-D and 3-D 
photographs of her daughter on one side, and only three items on the other: 
     (1) A 3-D snapshot excised from a sensor log during last year's hypnosis experiment, 
showing Tenchi just after summoning the Lighthawk Wings.  The photo brought a lump to her 
throat every time she looked at it.
     (2) A framed photograph of Tenchi in the fields, taken by his father.  Tenchi was 
leaning on his hoe, wiping sweat from his brow and talking to Ryo-ohki.  This photo brought 
a lump to her throat, too, but for a different reason. 
     (3) A stuffed toy guinea pig, given to her by Tenchi at Christmas.  Her most prized 
possession.
     The monitor was plugged-in to the subspace communication networks transmitting across 
half a dozen interstellar empires, including Jurai.  She could look at real-time broadcasts 
from hundreds of planets, space stations, trade routes, and even research installations.  
Today, it was focused on the dock just ten meters from the Masaki's front door.  Telemetry 
data was superimposed over the glowing sphere, telling her that nothing had changed in two 
days.
     In this room she could laugh mirthlessly, scream obscenities, and weep in frustration, 
safe from prying eyes.  And in the past hour, she had done all three.  
     She felt helpless, which she absolutely despised.
     Though her eyes were focused on the screen, her mind was focused on her memories.  She 
had been hurt so badly in the past, once by a faithless husband and once by an invidious 
assistant, that she tended to dismiss most men as villainous or untrustworthy or incompetent 
or self-absorbed.  Supplementary research (i.e., occasional affairs) between the two events 
had only confirmed her opinion that decent men were as rare as supernovae.  So she had sworn
off them.  Probably forever.
     Until the young supernova in the photographs had rescued her from captivity.
     Suddenly, old feelings had re-emerged, and old dreams had come visiting in the night.  
The shock of reuniting with her daughter was nothing compared to the impact Tenchi had made 
on her.  The Mighty Washu had fallen in love....and she was just flat-out giddy, an 
embarrassing reaction easily disguised by her eccentric behavior.  She caressed the brooch 
she had worn for four days, trying to draw more comfort out of it.  But the magic charm 
could not hide the fact that Tenchi may not survive his present circumstances.  Fate had 
snatched happiness from her grasp twice before, and fate could do it again now.
     Her computers had sifted through the history of the Juraian Royal Family, looking for 
similar such incidents over the lifetime of the dynasty.  Tsunami had been right: there were
detailed accounts of the four monarchs who had successfully deployed the Lighthawk Wings.  
Those rulers had been prodigious Adepts, and just as able peacemakers.  Each had overseen a 
Golden Age of sorts.  There were also disturbing references to other family members who had 
attempted the transformation -- and then had disappeared abruptly from the public records.  
Next she had attempted to correlate the psychological profiles of the survivors with Tenchi's 
profile, but had failed due to insufficient data.  She was, to put it simply, flying blind.
     She sat for a while staring at the screen, aroused only by motion captured by the camera.  
Lady Funaho and Sasami were walking down to the dock, placing their hands upon the cocoon, 
their mouths moving soundlessly.  Washu could have turned up the gain on the microphone, but
chose instead not to eavesdrop.  This group of characters had become her family.  Her 
*extended* family, she corrected; she wanted to start her own family with Tenchi.
     She hoped desperately that she'd get the chance.

     Sasami ran her hand along the cocoon, feeling its warmth and squinting against its 
internal radiance.  It pulsed slowly, in rhythm with Tenchi's heartbeat, just like the 
Lighthawk Wings did.  She had expected the surface to be smooth, but it had a grainy, 
pebble-like texture.  It made her think of a giant egg, which lessened its ominous 
appearance somehow. 
     Of all the people in the house, she was the least concerned.  Not only could she still 
feel him through their link, but she had suffered no precognitive dreams about this event.  
Not one.  Tsunami had made several appearances since Lady Funaho had arrived, but she hadn't 
seemed overly anxious about Tenchi's confinement.  Sasami had a hunch that Tsunami was in 
contact with him, but just not revealing it.  She shrugged; let Tsunami keep her secrets for
now -- Sasami would learn them eventually.
     She looked over at her Half-Mother.  Funaho was definitely worried about her great-
grandson.  Sasami was aware of some of the controversy surrounding Yosho, and Funaho's deep 
disappointment that Yosho could not (or would not) follow their father onto the throne.  She
had asked Ayeka about it a couple of times, but her sister had always dodged the question, 
as though Sasami was incapable of understanding the answer.  Funaho was more willing to 
discuss such topics.  And she generally did a better job of it.  Even Sasami could see that 
Funaho had high hopes for Tenchi; well, they all did.
     Funaho had arrived at their doorstep expecting everyone to be ready to leave with her; 
their reluctance, and then this cocoon business, put quite a crimp in her plans.  Sasami 
liked having Funaho around, and hoped that she would stay for the weddings.  Sasami had been
talking with Ryoko and Washu about what kind of wedding cakes they wanted, and refreshments 
and special meals.  She was looking forward to these challenges, and had been told she could
get any ingredients and assistance she wanted.  And she fully intended to take them up on it.
     Sasami picked up a clump of snow and smeared it onto the cocoon.  The snow sizzled off 
like a frying egg.  She repeated the process several times, just because she liked to watch 
it.  Her attention drifted over to the lake, where Funaho's shuttle lay semi-submerged in 
the steamy waters.  It's engines were keeping the center of the lake warm, but she could see
ice forming along the banks.  Funaho was looking at the shuttle, also, contemplating 
something.  She must have decided to wait, because she turned back towards the house.
     Sasami joined Funaho; while it was tense in the house, it was cold outside, and there 
was no visible change to the cocoon.  Washu would let them know if anything changed, and 
asami had to think about starting lunch soon.
     She sent a message down the link to Tenchi, wishing him well.  There was no answer, only 
mental static.
