Okay, this chapter's kinda short cuz I couldn't think of anymore stuff 
to say.  Who's intrigued so far?  Everyone?  Good!  Now, you all know 
what comes next.  I do not own Tenchi Muyo!  Anybody who's gonna sue me 
should know in advance all you'll get is about two cents, cuz I don't 
get an allowance and I don't have a job.  Wanna know why?  I'm to busy 
writing wonderful fan fiction!

	"IRELAND!  We have to go to Ireland?" screamed Ryoko.  
	"Yeah, that's about the size of it," said Washu.
	"But why Ireland?  Why do we have to go halfway around the world 
in order to find one of the power stones?" asked Keimosari.
	"Well, have you noticed that Ireland has been getting extremely 
strong winds lately?  That may be caused by the stone," said Washu.
	"Of course!  The Air stone!" exclaimed Keimosari.
	"Well, how are we gonna take this trip?" asked Aeka.
	"Leave that to me," said Nekaia.
	"Okay, wait a minute.  First you get us limos, a five star hotel, 
and now you want to pay for plane tickets?  Where do you get all of the 
money?" asked Tenchi.
	"From my purse, obviously," replied Nekaia.  "So, when do we 
leave?"
	"Hold on.  Washu, the earthquakes here were caused by a rock 
monster.  Are the winds in Ireland caused by some monster too?" asked 
Kiyone.
	"It's more than likely," answered Washu.  Everyone groaned.

	A couple days later the group was checking into a hotel in 
Dublin.
	"Who's up for Riverdance?" asked Mihoshi.
	"We are here to find the Air stone, not to watch idiotic line 
dancing!" said Ryoko.
	"Look, let's just find this thing and go.  There's too much green 
here.  It's unnatural," said Aeka.
	"Too much green?  Aeka, Ireland is beautiful!" Keimosari said.
	"They do call it 'The Emerald Isle'," added Nekaia.
	"I'm just hoping that the monster we're supposed to find isn't as 
nasty as the last one," said Sasami.  A cold, strong wind began to 
blow.  Everyone shivered, not wanting to find out what was causing the 
wind.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Nekaia had a strange dream that night.  She couldn't remember 
much about it, except that she was pointing a gun at someone.  But all 
of a sudden, she was awoken by a scream.  It was Tenchi.
	Nekaia quickly put on a bathrobe and ran next door to Tenchi's 
room.  Keimosari and Aeka were already there.
	"What happened?" asked Nekaia.
	"I don't know.  I heard Tenchi scream, and when I came over he 
wouldn't wake up," Aeka said.  She pointed at Keimosari, who was 
kneeling next to Tenchi's bed.
	"Come on!  This is not good," she said to Nekaia and Aeka.  
"There's definitely a strong power going on here, but I can't figure 
out what."  She turned back to Tenchi and closed her eyes.  Tenchi's 
body began to glow faintly.
	"Yes! Yes!" Keimosari said, relieved.  Tenchi began to wake up.
	"Hey, what are you guys doing in my room?" he yawned.
	"We heard you scream, and we were worried," Aeka said.
	"I screamed?" Tenchi asked.
	"And then, something was wrong, because you couldn't wake up.  
Keimosari had to use a spell," Nekaia said.
	"Kei, you had to use a spell?  What happened?" he asked.
	"It was weird.  As if someone had used a tranquilizer dart that 
was really powerful.  I think I'm gonna go back to bed now.  That spell 
took a lot out of me without the Star," Keimosari said.
	"Okay.  Thanks for helping me," Tenchi said.  He could faintly 
remember a dream he was having.  He was holding on to someone, then 
there was an awful pain in his chest.  That must have been why he 
screamed.  But it was weird, the dream seemed too real, and so 
familiar.
***********************************************************************
***************
	The next day, everyone decided to go for a walk.  Along the way, 
Nekaia and Sasami decided to buy kites and make use of the powerful 
winds.  They spent the day at the park, but on the way home, something 
happened.  Nekaia noticed a wanted poster on a building.  The name on 
the poster was Hadenka Mateo.
	"Look!  That guy on the poster!  He-he has my last name!" she 
cried.  Tenchi and Keimosari looked at each other.  They remembered all 
to well the little incident involving Dr. Hadenka.  Most of all, they 
remembered how that was the last time Keimosari had the Star of Jurai.  
But a loud roar interrupted their train of thought.  They slowly turned 
around.
	Behind them there was a huge monster.  It was transparent, and 
began to blow a violent wind out of its mouth.
	"Not again!  Okay, do you remember how to turn it back into a 
stone Keimosari?" asked Kiyone.
	"I think I have to touch it!" Keimosari stepped closer to the 
monster, but before she even came within ten feet of it, it took a deep 
breath and summoned up a wind that threw her into the wall of the 
building.
	"Kei!" Tenchi cried.  He ran over to her and helped her up. 
	"Stand back Tenchi.  I'm going to use the Earth Stone!" she 
yelled.  Closing her eyes, the earth began to shake, and the monster 
fell to its knees.  Keimosari quickly ran over to it and managed to 
touch it before it blew her away again.  
	The monster let out an awful cry but the shrinking had already 
begun.  A few seconds later, the monster had been contained in the Air 
stone.  But before Keimosari could grab it, Nekaia picked it up.  A 
strange expression crossed her face.  It was part curiosity, part 
anger, and part sadness.  
	"Niki-chan?" Keimosari called softly.  The look on Nekaia's face 
passed.  She held out the Air stone to Keimosari.
	"I believe this is yours.  And don't call me Niki-chan!" she 
cried.
***********************************************************************
***************
	After Nekaia had gone to sleep that night, Tenchi and the other 
girls sat in Aeka's room talking.  The conversation turned to Nekaia 
and the Air stone.
	"Did you see the way she looked at it?  It was almost as if she'd 
seen it before, and wanted it for herself," said Ryoko.
	"I know.  And what about that wanted poster for Dr. Hadenka we 
saw today?  It seems more than a coincidence," Tenchi said.
	"Come on you guys.  Niki-chan's a little girl.  What harm could 
she be?" asked Keimosari.
	"More than any of us bargain for Keimosari, way more," Washu 
answered.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"What do you want?" Nekaia asked.  
	"Now, now dear, you're not doing your job," Dr. Hadenka replied.
	"Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about or who you are.  
Will you just send me back and leave me alone?" Nekaia complained.
	"Really, you had it today.  Why did you let that Air stone go?" 
Hadenka asked.
	"It's not mine.  It's Keimosari's.  And if you're gonna tell me 
it's my job to take her stones, you can just forget about it, 'cause 
I'm not gonna do it!" Nekaia yelled defiantly.  Dr. Hadenka just smiled 
and patted her on the head.
	"I see.  You still have a conscience.  Don't worry, it will be 
gone in time.  And when it does, you will be powerful my dear, very 
powerful."
	Nekaia rolled over in her sleep.

	"All right Keimosari, I've figure out your pattern," said Washu 
the next morning.  "You have to go somewhere incredibly far away, 
defeat a monster created by a certain power stone, and then claim that 
power stone."
	"No kidding.  The important question is where the heck we're 
gonna go next," Keimosari replied.
	"That's really hard to figure out at this point.  There's no 
pattern as to which stone will appear when.  We just have to wait and 
see what happens," Washu explained.
	"So, is it even worth going back to Japan?" Tenchi asked.
	"I don't think it would be wise, because the chances of another 
stone being there are really slim.  It would be best to wait here in 
Ireland until we can find another stone," replied Washu.
	"Well, may as well make use of the time.  I bought tickets to 
Riverdance!" cried Mihoshi.  Everyone groaned.
