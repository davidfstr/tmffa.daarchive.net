The characters and places do not belong to me and I ain't making a dime
of this so don't sue me.  This is a Tenchi Muyo fanfiction it is my
first attempt so if it sucks try to be nice in the mail.

Which do I choose

I look at the clock 3am why did that fight have to go so far now both
Ryoko and Aeka are expecting me to make a decission tomorrow but which
do I choose?
I guess the thing to do is to look at each one individually I guess I
will start with Aeka well lets see I mean I no she loves me or at least
thinks she does that really nags at me she claimed to love grandpa but
almost immediately she shifts from me to him I wonder if I want related
to him would she be interested in me at all?
Aeka though has her strong points she is beautiful well mannered and
kind but at the same time she is somewhat aloof and cold. I know my two
biggest problems with her are she is technically my great ant and
marrying her means leaving earth for good to rule Jurie which is
something I just don't want to do.
On the other hand there is Ryoko while I admit she is just a good
looking as Aeka she does somewhat frighten me I know she wouldn't hurt
me but still you have to wonder if she would let me run my on life but
that also applies to Aeka I suppose Ryoko would probably quit being so
aggressive once she did not have to compete with Aeka and life would
definitely not be boring with her around no it defiantly would not.

The next morning.

"Lord Tenchi" Aeka said "have you decided on which one of us you love me
or that demon which"
"LOOK WHO'S TALKING" Ryoko screamed.  Before a fight could start I said
yes I have they both stopped and stared suddenly an uncomfatable silence
went over the room.
I cleared my throught and said I choose
