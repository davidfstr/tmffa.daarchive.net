First, the disclaimers. I only own Jim, Lenny, Todd,
and Matt. I own nobody else in this fic.
 Not in this part anyway, but I might add more
characters later.
 I own no other item else either. So don't sue me! I
only have twenty bucks at the time anyway...

       Well, here is Inventors Part 1: Pancake.



           Inventors - Part One: Pancake

The battle of a life time was happening. One man
against another, one weilding a large sword, heavy
armor, and magical powers of evil.
The other... Well.... He had a bazooka. Well,
actually, he was only using a bazooka at the time, but
that isnt the point.
The man with the bazooka whipped out some kind of a
machine, pulled the trigger, and a lightning bolt flew
out and hit the armored man, and it blew of a piece of
the armor.
Then, the man with the bazooka held down the trigger,
sending a huge amount of lightning at the armored man,
blasting off his chest plate. Then, the man shot a
missle at the armored mans chest, and he screamed in
pain.

Armored Man: Aghh!!!!

Then, he exploded into little chunks of... Stuff that
looked like tennis balls.

???: Jim, will you stop playing that game? I need to
see everyone for a moment.

Ok, so it wasnt an epic battle over the fate of
mankind. One of our main characters was playing Return
To Castle Wolfenstein on his computer.
And all that typing over nothing. Well, back to the
story.

Jim: Alright, Lenny. Let me just see the ending movie,
okay?
Lenny: Fine.

Lenny then walked out of the room, and after a few
minutes, Jim did the same.
As he was walking down the hall, he noticed on of his
roommates beating the living daylights out of a
punching bag.

Jim: Todd, Lenny wants everybody.
Todd: Just a sec.

Todd then knocked the punching bag in two with a
jumping roundhouse.

Todd: Lets go.
Jim: Do you know where Matt is?
Todd: Last time I saw him, he was in the garage.
Jim: Ill go get him.

Jim went to the garage, and Todd went to find Lenny.

Jim: Matt?!
Matt: What?
Jim: Lenny wants everybody.
Matt: Ok. Lets go.

Jim and Matt then proceeded to the living room, where
Lenny and Todd were.

Lenny: Now that everyone is here, we can start.
Jim: Start what?
Lenny: Start this.

Lenny pulled a sheet off of a large machine.

Todd, Matt, Jim: THE DIMENSIONAL PORTAL???!!!
Lenny: Yes.
Matt: I thought we would never use that again?
Todd: Yeah, I mean, if it werent for that thing, Abe
Lincon would'nt have been assasinated!!!
Lenny Shrugged.
Lenny: Well, we were fooling around that time, but
this time we'll be serious explorers.
Matt: We'll need some equipment.
Jim: I can take care of that. Now lets get to work!

***********************************************************************
At the Masaki Residence...

Ayeka: RYOKO!!!!
It was a typical day at the Masakis house. Ryoko and
Ayeka were beating the heck out of eachother, Sasami
was cooking, Mihoshi was bothering Washu, And everyone
else werent really doing anything in particular.

Tenchi: Maybe we should stop them before they destroy
the house....
Kiyone: Nahh, Washu made the house resistant to Ryoko
and Ayekas attacks, remember?
Tenchi: Oh yeah...

Meanwhile, in Washus Lab....

Mihoshi got herself knocked uncoinscious when she
screwed with a tesla reactor, and Washu was creating
some Dimensional Hazard.
I can predict where our heroes are headed.
***********************************************************************
Back with the others....

Jim: Well, its finally ready.
Lenny: Time to go.
Todd: Lets do it!
Matt: Yeah!

The Dimensional Portal opened, and this fic ended a
split-second later. Tough luck.
