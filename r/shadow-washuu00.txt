In the Shadow of Washuu



             *usual Disclaimers: Tenchi Muyo isn't mine but the idea of Chibi 
Ryoko is, the rest of the characters belong to the Pioneer peoples... I REALLY 
have to get on with the story.........*


Without further ado, Miss Chibi Presents the Chibi Ryoko Self-reflection thing 
In the "Shadow of Washuu"



I have come a long way and for what?
To be a guinea pig.
AGAIN.......
I dunno.....
I can't stand be around her.........
Ryoko says it's only natural to want to kill Washuu....
Okay, why can't I? Maybe because I don't want to? Nah....
I do,though. Tenchi says that I shouldn't go around just killing somebody for 
stuff she hasn't done yet.I can care less about what Tenchi says. He can jump 
off a cliff. Better yet, I'll kill him in his sleep...... no, wait. If he dies I 
die, right.Think, *sigh* Wait a minute............... Ryoko's miserable 
now.........
I'M GONNA BE MISERABLE......... 

And the pink haired demon remains........................

I guess that misery is all that remains in the shadow of Washuu............
