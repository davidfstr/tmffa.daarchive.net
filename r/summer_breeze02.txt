Summer Breeze, Chapter Two: Roses Amidst Sunflowers

        A loud “SPLASH!” echoed throughout the forest. A fourteen-year-old
Sasami’s
face
appeared out of thewater of the lake. Then her neck and shoulders came next.
She giggled and pulled
Ayeka in. She screamed as she felt someone’s smooth hands on her ankle and
she
felt water rushing past her body. The flustered goddess finally got to the
surface and
gasped for air. Sasami began giggling again. Ayeka spit out a mouth full of
lake water
and pushed herself up onto the shore. “Sasami why did you do that?!” she
asked her
little sister. Sasami laughed and pushed herself up beside Ayeka.
        “You need to get out more,” she said, still laughing and shaking her
head
at the same
time. Ayeka rolled her eyes.
        “You interrupted my thinking, you know.” Sasami looked kind of
surprised.
        “What were you thinking about?” she asked. Ayeka shook her head and
got up. She walked over to a tree and disappeared. Sasami face faulted.
She looked all around for her sister, but couldn’t find her anywhere. Then
she looked back at the tree. There, she saw her sister hanging upside down
on one of the branches by her legs.
        “I can get out more,” she said. “You just aren’t there to witness
it.”
Sasami got up and walked over to where her sister was hanging. Ayeka
saw an upside down princess. “What?” she asked. Sasami pulled her
down.
        “We better go,” she told her. “I just heard Tenchi call for lunch
time.”
Ayeka oh’d. They both took their towels and walked back out of the
forest together. When they got back to the household, everyone was
sitting on a large checkered white and red picnic blanket. They were
all smiling and having a good time––even Washu was there! The
two sisters exchanged happy glances and ran over to them. Tenchi
looked up. He saw Ayeka and Sasami’s faces smiling down at him.
He smiled back at them and pulled Ayeka’s arm down so she would sit.
She did, and Sasami sat next to her.
        “What’re we havin’ today?” Ayeka asked.
        “Well,” Ryoko said. “We’re having shrimp, rice balls, miso soup,
and umm...oh yeah! Teriyaki chicken.” Ayeka smiled.
        “Yummy!” Yakouri said. Everyone laughed.
        “Wait! We’re forgetting something. But what is it?” Ayeka said.
Everyone hmm’d. Ayeka put a finger to her head. “Hmmmm.....oh!
Tea!” She got up and ran towards the house.
        “Her and her tea,” Sasami said. Washu laughed.
        “She likes it a lot. And she makes it really good too,” the
scientist
chimed in.

        “Okay tea, tea, where’s the tea?....” Ayeka mumbled as she looked
in all the cupboards for a box of tea mix. “Come on...there has to be
some tea around here somewhere...” Finally she found some and
took eight cups out of another cupboard. After making it, she poured
the steaming substance into each cup and put them all on a tray. She
slid the door open with her foot and left it open. She walked slowly
making sure not to spill the hot tea on anything or anyone. Then she set it
down and gave a glass to everyone. She sat down and held the warm
cup with both hands. “So, is the food ready?” Washu and her daughter
were just about done passing out the plates and the food. “I take that as
a yes.” Tenchi laughed her and put an arm around her shoulder.
        “Washu’s just really eager to get back to the lab. She thinks she’s
discovered some new species of bug,” he explained. Sasami and Ayeka
oh’d at the same time.
        “Just what we need,” Sasami started to say.
        “More bugs,” Ayeka finished. “Like there aren’t enough in the
universe already...” the two princesses glanced at each other. Then
Ayeka felt a finger tapping her shoulder. She turned her head and
saw Washu standing above her, smiling.
        “Want some chicken?” she asked. Ayeka nodded. Washu put some
on her plate and then moved onto Sasami. When Ryoko and her
mother were done passing out the food, they plopped down and began eating.
Washu ate pretty quickly and was done a couple minutes after she had passed
out the food. She put the plate aside and stood up. She jogged back to the
house. Everyone sweat dropped. “Good lunch!” the scientist called over her
shoulder. She ran into the open door and then closed it. Everybody just
stared.
        “Okay, we didn’t see that,” Ryoko said about after a minute, still
staring.
Then everyone else shrugged and went back to lunch.

        The little mad scientist turned the corner sharply, barely managing
to stay
on her
feet. “Finally!” she muttered as she got to the door of the magnificent lab
she
had built and set up in an old broom closet. She opened it, and hopped in to
find
her lab destroyed. She screamed in agony. “HOW THE HELL COULD THIS
*HAPPEN*?!?!” she shouted, rushing around to all kinds of broken down
machines and spilled chemicals. The she suddenly stopped. “She couldn’t’ve.
No. I know *she* didn’t do this. She can’t get in here. But what if it *was*
her?!”Washu began to panic all over again. She screamed again and ran around
hugging the broken machines and devices. “It’s okay, mommy’s here....I’ll
fix
ya’ll up in a jiffy!...” She cried big, wet tears. When she stopped, she
realized
someone was watching her. She looked over towards the entrance of the lab
and saw Ayeka, Tenchi, and Sasami’s––legs! She looked down and saw them
on the ground. They all sweat dropped with x’s in their eyes. Washu laughed
nervously and sweat dropped as well. They got up and looked at her.
        “Umm...we were just leaving!” Ayeka said, smiling and pointing
towards
the door. “Bye now!” They all rushed out of the lab, Washu staring after
them. She laughed again and let go of the machine her arms were firmly
latched around. She slowly walked out of the lab and into the living room
where Mihoshi was sitting on the couch, watching the news.
        “Mihoshi?” she asked. Mihoshi turned her head away from the t.v.
Her sky blue eyes met with Washu’s piercing green ones. The GP
shivered just a little bit.
        “Y-yes Little Washu?”she replied. Washu closed her eyes and smiled.
        “Do you know what happened in my lab this morning?” she
asked again. Mihoshi gulped quite loudly. Washu’s shadow
washed over her shaking body. Lightning flashed behind the mad
scientist, scaring the GP out of her wits. Washu’s smile became
wider as a high pitched scream rang throughout the house.

        Ayeka looked up from the lake. “Hmm?” she said. She looked over
at Sasami. Her sister shrugged. Ayeka’s expression became troubled.
“I wonder what Mihoshi did wrong *this* time.” Sasami rolled her
eyes and smiled.
        “Don’t worry,” she replied. “Mihoshi can take care of herself.
She’s a little klutzy anyway.”
        “Ya think?” Ayeka said to her sister sarcastically. Sasami became
frustrated a bit and rolled her eyes skyward once more. Ayeka
laughed. “I was just joking sis. Anyway, you were saying?”
        “Yes, as I WAS SAYING,” she said rather loudly, looking at
her older sister fiercely. “Mihoshi is a little klutzy, but if she
breaks anything irreplaceable, we can forgive her right away.”
        “Not if she messes with Washu’s lab,” she remarked matter-of-factly.
Suddenly she felt like millions of imaginary Washus were staring her down.
“*LITTLE* Washu wouldn’t forgive her for weeks!” she added, seeing
all of the imaginary Washus mad faces turning bright and cheery again.
Sasami giggled.
        “Well we better get back to the house before Mihoshi gets into even
*more* trouble,” Sasami said, hoisting herself up onto the shore.
Ayeka did the same. They each wrapped themselves in each other’s
towels and walked back through the woods in silence.

        Mihoshi screamed again. “I’ll ask you one more time,” the mad
scientist said warningly. “Why were you in my lab this morning?”
Big tears came from the GP’s eyes.
        “I have no idea what you’re talking about Little Washu!!!!” she
wailed. Washu sighed.
        “Looks like we aren’t getting anywhere...” she mumbled.
“Fine...I’ll talk to you later. Go to your room.” Mihoshi nodded
and bounced off the couch.She hurried upstairs and slid her door open.
When Washu heard the door shut, she strode
back to her lab quite calmly to work on what was left of it.

        “Miya!” the cabbit meowed happily. Soon, she was done with the
bright, orange carrot that was wedged between her paws. It had
disappeared in less than two minutes.
        “Geez,” Tenchi said, bending down again and pulling taking the green
crown of a carrot, pulling it out, and tossing it over his shoulder and into
the basket. “Don’t eat so fast or you’ll get the hicupps.” Right on cue,
Ryo-Ohki’s little brown body of fluff began bouncing up and down.
Tenchi laughed. The cabbit soon became very frustrated and slowly
bounced off towards the house. She reached the sliding glass door and
bounced in front of it until she was ready to hop through it. Then the
cabbit leapt forward, but bounced off of the glass! She hissed at the
door and tried again. Tenchi stood about ten yards behind her and tried
to stifle his laughter, but didn’t succeed. He laughed at Ryo-Ohki for a
couple of seconds, and then stopped. He walked slowly over to the door
and opened it. “Just think,” he started to say to the cabbit. “A war
between you and the sliding glass door breaking out one of these days...”
Ryo-Ohki bounded off somewhere unknown in the house, and Tenchi
walked into the kitchen with a heavy basket full of bright, orange carrots.
He set the basket on the counter for Sasami to clean. Then he wiped the
sweat off his forehead and decided to take a shower. On his way up the
stairs,
Tenchi met Kiyone in the hall.
        “Hiya Tenchi! What’s up?” she said. He laughed.
        “Nothing really. I just came back from the carrot fields and
Ryo-Ohki had a
bad encounter with the glass door.” Kiyone giggled.
        “Someday World War III: The Cabbit and the Horrible Sliding Glass
Door,
is going to break out between that cabbit and the door,” she replied.
        “That’s just what I told her. She’ll learn soon.”
        “Well Mihoshi and I have to go on patrol. We’ll see you before
dinner.”
Tenchi nodded and headed towards his room. He slid open the door and
disappeared. Kiyone headed towards Mihoshi’s room. When she got to the door,
she heard a strange noise. “What the hell is she doing in there?!...” she
muttered
to herself while sliding the door open and peering in. She face faulted and
sweat
dropped. The weird sound was coming from the slumbering GP on her futon.
She snored quite loudly. Kiyone rolled her eyes and walked over to her
sleeping
partner. She took a deep breath. Then: “GET THE HELL UP MIHOSHI!!!
IT’S TIME TO GO ON PATROL!!!” The reply: snoring. Red creeped up the
detective’s face. She took a deep breath and held it for a couple seconds.
Then
she exhaled and relaxed. “Okay fine. Just don’t come crying to me when you
get in trouble by the chief...” she said, turning around and heading for the
door.
She stopped dead in her tracks when another heavy weight was combined with
hers. She looked down and face faulted.
        “DON’T LEAVE WITHOUT ME KIYONE!!!” Mihoshi wailed. Kiyone
sighed and rolled her eyes skyward. “PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DON’T
LEAVE ME!!! I DON’T WANNA GET IN TROUBLE!!!” Realizing the
annoyed GP wasn’t responding to her pleads, Mihoshi let go and stood up.
She wiped away her tears and latched her arms firmly around Kiyone’s neck.
Kiyone sighed. “I knew you wouldn’t go without me! We have to hurry
Kiyone or we’ll be late!” They quickly got dressed in their uniforms and
hurried outside. Kiyone activated the Yagami and they flew off into space to
patrol the Sol System.

Dinner came a little early that night. About a half an hour before the
normal time,
Sasami had finished cooking the meal. She set the all the dishes on the
table and
called up the stairs: "DINNER!!" Everyone came down the stairs, confused at
the
early time. Ryoko floated into the kitchen where Sasami was washing her
hands.
She saw the little princess rip a paper towel from the roll and wipe the
water off
of her small hands. Sasami opened the bottom cuboard and tossed the damp
towel
into the garbage. Then she closed it and turned around. "Yes Ryoko?" she
asked.
"Umm....Sasami, why did you cook dinner so early tonight? It's not really
like you
to cook it about an hour early," the demon said. Sasami smiled.
"I just thought everyone could have dinner earlier so they could get things
done
with more time."
"But we can practically stay up all night," Ryoko told her. Then she
remembered
Tenchi had school, and the children were still kind of young. "Well all of
us except
for you and Tenchi, and maybe Mihoshi and Kiyone and the children, but
otherwise,
we can do things late at night." Sasami shrugged.
"Oh well. I just needed to get dinner out of the way," she replied. And with
that said,
she walked out of the kitchen and to the table. Ryoko watched her go and
shrugged
as well. Then she floated out and into the dining room. The cyan haired
demon sat
down and began to eat. Everyone else ate too.

"WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!?!" a very sad Mihoshi wailed. "HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME KIYONE?! WHY DID YOU STOP THE TAPE?!?! IT WAS
GETTING TO THE GOOD PART!!!!" Kiyone rolled her eyes.
"I'm tired of you just sitting around on your lazy ass and watching cartoons
or sleeping!
I'm usually doing all the work. Besides, t.v. isn't good for you," Mihoshi's
partner said
in an annoyed tone. Mihoshi tried to hold back her loud sobs but failed
badly. She ran
away and into her cabin. Mihoshi flung herself on the bed and buried her
face in the
pillow that layed before her. After about an hour, her sobs subsided and
soon became
silent. She had cried herself to sleep.
_What about your promise?!_ a voice inside of Kiyone screamed. _You're
supposed to
be nicer to her! Not meaner!_
"But she isn't supposed to be watching cartoons on duty!" Kiyone yelled
back. Her
"other-self" rolled her eyes.
_You're just plain mean! Why don't you just let her watch the cartoons? She
probably
was just telling herself in there that she hates you now..._ Kiyone thought
about that
for a moment.
[Maybe I was *too* harsh...] her thoughts trailed off when she heard the
door to
Mihoshi's cabin open. Kiyone looked up to the tear stained face of her
partner.
"Mihoshi I..." she started to say. But Mihoshi put up her hand.
"It's okay Kiyone," she said, smiling slightly. "I know you were just trying
to do
your job. I promise I won't watch the shows anymore if it'll make you
happy."
Kiyone was very taken aback by this. Mihoshi, not wanting to watch her
cartoons?!
Now there was definantly something wrong with that.
[That's just plain **wrong**!!!] Kiyone yelled at herself. Then she swore at
herself.
[I can't do this to her. She wouldn't be Mihoshi anymore if I told her she
*couldn't*
watch cartoons!] "No Mihoshi. If you stop watching your cartoons, it won't
make me
happy. It will only make me sad to see that you're not enjoying yourself. I
only get
mad at you because I'm lonely doing all that work and I have no one to talk
to. That
makes me frustrated and you're the only one around, so I take it out on
you."
Kiyone's voice said it all. Mihoshi bounded over to Kiyone and hugged her.
Kiyone
hugged her partner back.
"Here Kiyone," Mihoshi said reaching into her pocket. "Here's something you
can
use to control your anger..." Kiyone looked at Mihoshi, her brow furrowed.
"Okay
now where is it? Is this it? No...it's gotta be in here! I checked my
pockets last week
and it was in there....now that definantly is *not* it!" Kiyone
sweatdropped. After
about ten minutes of pulling various objects out of her pocket and
identifying them,
Mihoshi finally found was she was looking for. "Here Kiyone," she said,
handing
her partner a mood ring. It was dark blue right now from being inside of
Mihoshi's
pocket for so long.
Kiyone slipped it on. "I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think I can
control
my anger better with this..." she told Mihoshi. Mihoshi's expression
saddened.
"But it is very pretty. Thank you Mihoshi." Mihoshi smiled again.
"Hey! Look! We're home!" Mihoshi said, pointing to the large green, blue,
brown,
and white planet ahead of them.

After landing, the GPs stepped out to find that it was pouring outside. They
both
squinted and saw that there were no lights on in the Masaki house. "Hey
Kiyone,"
Mihoshi said. "I know a place where we can go instead of inside Yagami all
night."
"Where Mihoshi?" Kiyone asked. But Mihoshi had already gone ahead. Kiyone
silently
followed. They eventually came to a sunflower field. "Where did this come
from?"
Kiyone asked, looking at the big yellow heads swaying back and forth in the
wind.
"Ryoko and I planted these last year. I'm surprised they lasted this long,"
Mihoshi replied.
Kiyone oh'd with facination. Then Mihoshi grabbed her partner's hand and
pulled her
under the sunflower heads. Only drips of rain came through the thick
flowers. Kiyone
looked up and then at her partner, amazed. Suddenly, Mihoshi started to
giggle.
"What?" Kiyone asked. Mihoshi's laughter subsided and she pointed at
Kiyone's soaked
head. "Oh. That. Well, no matter. It'll dry by tomorrow. But right now we
should get some
sleep." Mihoshi agreed. Kiyone layed down then sprang back up again. "Ouch!"
she said,
rubbing the back of her right arm. Then she looked to the right of her body
and saw a
young rose. She smiled and looked over at her "already-asleep" partner.
Then, laying
down again (this time avoiding the rose), Kiyone fell asleep to the sound of
the rain on
the sunflower heads.

Author's Notes: Well that's the end of chapter two. It seemed funnier to me
then the last one. I kinda like ending the chapters with Kiyone and Mihoshi.
I'm beginning to understand their relationship better. The next chapter is
called: "Summer Breeze, Chapter Three: The Mysterious Golden Cloth". This is
only my first attempt at a fanfic so please send C&C so I'll get better
(Send C&C and flames to lilserena20@hotmail.com)!

Thanx!
