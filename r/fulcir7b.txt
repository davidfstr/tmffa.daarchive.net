                           INTERLUDE
Opening Shot: Darkness.

                         WASHUU (O.S.)
            Well, there were a few things he forgot.

A spotlight fades back in on WASHUU who's holding the control matrix.

                            WASHUU
            The dimensional instability caused by the
            overload caused a minor memory block on
            each of the people involved.  Which, in
            essence, meant that they would think they
            were who they were impersonating in the
            universe they were in. <beat> That doesn't
            make much sense does it.

She starts pacing in a circle while the spotlight follows her.

                            WASHUU
            Okay. <beat>  After I deleted the universe
            they were in, they moved into another one
            of the stacked worlds that were created in
            in the overload. That's when I <clears throat>
            temporarily lost their signals...

Fade to WASHUU and ADAM standing in some psychedelic area.  WASHUU is
working on the control matrix.

                            WASHUU
            <loud; sharp> Drat!

                             ADAM
            What now?  You didn't lose the signal did
            you?

                            WASHUU
            Yup.

                             ADAM
            <blinks> You're joking.

                            WASHUU
            When they jumped between universes their
            signal got muddled by the deletion signal.

                             ADAM
            So... <beat> What? I gotta find them again?

                            WASHUU
            It's the only way to isolated them again.
            <beat> I would go bu...

                             ADAM
            Yeah, I know, I can't fix the matrix by
            myself.

ADAM reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ring and puts it on his
right hand.  Raising his hands, the shadowy computer appears.

                             ADAM
            <flat> Looks like 1990's, Japan.  The focal
            universe seems to be around a small community
            high school.  <beat> Woah.  High amounts of
            supernatural energy, way beyond anything
            Pendragon put out or that package used against
            Ryouko.

WASHUU stops working on the matrix and looks up at ADAM.

                            WASHUU
            You'll be vulnerable to their energy if you're
            caught off guard.

                             ADAM
            <continues typing> I know, you told me last
            time.

                            WASHUU
            Oh. <beat; noncommittal> Be careful.

ADAM turns to look at WASHUU as she turns to continue working on the
control matrix.

                             ADAM
            <small smile> I will.

ADAM turns to the keyboard and types a few last things.

                             ADAM
            I'm going in.

                            WASHUU
            Ready. <beat> Activating temporary matrix
            protocol.

The matrix glows in WASHUU's hands.  Sparks jump along one edge of the
matrix before condensing into one pulse that shoots off and strikes
ADAM.  A few seconds later it stops and ADAM is gone.

                            WASHUU
            <whispered> Come back to me.

               Episode 7: Time And Space Adventures

                             ACT II

Establishing shot: Darkness.  Letters slowly form on the screen in
white:
                           S A S A M I

Fade to a large community in the morning.  There is a reddish hue to
all the buildings.  Pan across the community, settling on a school,
before slowly zooming in.

Before the school totally encompasses the camera, cut to the inside of
a classroom.  A male SENSEI is writing on the board while the class
is taking notes, except for TENCHI, RYOUKO, and AEKA, sitting in the
same row.  RYOUKO, on his left, and AEKA, on his right, are staring
at him with hearts in their eyes.  TENCHI is looking back and forth
between them with a scared look in his eye.

                             SENSEI
            <loud> Tenchi!

                             TENCHI
            <looks up> Huh?

                             SENSEI
            <beat; raises an eyebrow> What did
            the Samurai say to Lord Lao Chi after
            the third invasion?

                             TENCHI
            Uhh.. <rubs back of head>

                             AEKA
            My third, is your first, Lao-sama.

The SENSEI looks at AEKA and raises an eyebrow.

                             SENSEI
            Very good, Aeka-chan.

AEKA gets a overly cross look on her face.

                             SENSEI
            <turns> He did indeed say that, and,
            while Lao Chi continued with his
            attacks across...

TENCHI looks over to AEKA and sighs a thanks.  AEKA blushes and waves
her hand in a dismissive manner.  RYOUKO, unseen by TENCHI, grits her
teeth and breaks the pen in her hand.

Cut to the outside of the school.  All the students are walking around
the campus before departing home.  Pan to show an overhead view of the
exit from the building.  TENCHI walks out of the school holding his
bag over his shoulder.

Cut to the front of TENCHI, following him as he walks by.

                            TENCHI
            <sighs> Every day... uhh, when will
            it stop.

                          AEKA(O.S.)
            Tenchi!

                         RYOUKO(O.S.)
            Tenchi!

Pan back to show AEKA and RYOUKO closing in on TENCHI from both sides.
RYOUKO gets to him first and grabs his arm to put it around her own.

                            RYOUKO
            Oh Tenchi! I've missed you so much! It's
            been such a long time.

                            TENCHI
            <mumbles> Ten minutes?

AEKA gets over to TENCHI and begins to grab him when she sees RYOUKO
holding onto his arm.

                             AEKA
            What do you think you're doing, clinging to
            Tenchi like that?

                            RYOUKO
            Exactly the same as your doing, little miss
            princess.  What?  You can do anything you
            want but everyone else has to ask permission?

                            TENCHI
            Uhhh....

                             AEKA
            I do not believe that!  You're just some
            greedy drifter who'd be better off pirating
            the seas!

                            TENCHI
            Really girls...

                            RYOUKO
            You're the stuck up one! And another thing...

Cut to a view of the argument from atop the fifth floor of the school
building.  The view becomes blurry as a hand holding a bow enters the
immediate foreground.  An arrow with a heart for a point is knocked
into the bow and pulled back.

Cut to a close up of the argument again.  AEKA is holding up her
clutched fist at RYOUKO who is smiling evilly back.

                            RYOUKO
            You know it's true!  I saw it with my own
            eyes!

                             AEKA
            <growls> It's a lie! I never did such a
            thing!

AEKA and RYOUKO let go of TENCHI as they get deeper into argument.
TENCHI slowly backs away from the impending blast zone.

                             AEKA
            How dare you spread such salatious
            rumors about me?

                            RYOUKO
            They're not rumors though, they are
            absolutely true!

Cut back to the bow and arrow atop the school building.

                         SASAMI[O.S.]
            They certainly are very angry.  They need
            to learn the value of good feelings and love.

The arrow shoots off.  Cut to a chase camera of the arrow as it flies
through the air and lands between AEKA and RYOUKO.  Pan across as
everyone in the courtyard looks up to the top of the school building.
Cut to show a view from one floor down looking up at the edge of the
roof that SASAMI is standing on with RYO-OHKI perched beside her.

                            SASAMI
            <yelled> The tragic fight between
            classmates is a taint on the pure white
            soul of the school.  Even the greatest
            of arguments can be solved through the
            slightest examples of love.  Learn now
            what is needed most between you do for
            I am Pretty Sami! Defender of love and
            peace!

Cut to the ground looking up at SASAMI.  The arrow is close to the
camera in the foreground.  It suddenly explodes and begins to expell
a purplish cloud that quickly engulfs the camera.  Cut to a side view.
As the purple cloud clears, RYOUKO and AEKA are merely looking at each
other with a slightly mesmerized look.

                            RYOUKO
            I'm sorry I was yelling at you, Aeka. I
            really think you're such a great person
            and a lovely dresser.

                             AEKA
            Oh no, I am sorry I yelled at you, Ryouko,
            I also believe you to be a very beautiful
            person.

                            RYOUKO
            I need to make it up to you...

                             AEKA
            As do I...

The two move real close together and close their eyes as they move
their heads closer together.

Cut to the roof behind SASAMI as she looks down the side of the
building at what's going on below.

                            SASAMI
            Another friendship rekindled.

                          ADAM[O.S.]
            Rekindled isn't exactly the world
            I would use.

SASAMI turns around quickly and RYO-OKI jumps up to sit on her head.
Upon seeing ADAM, she looks startled and pulls out an arrow with a
lightning bolt for a head and aims the bow at him.

                            SASAMI
            Who are you who spies on my work?

ADAM puts his hands up and smiles.

                             ADAM
            Woah, calm down, Sasami.  It's just
            me, Adam.

A flash of recognition flutters across her face but is quickly
vanquished.  She shakes her head to rid the memory.

                            SASAMI
            I don't know you, Adam. What is your
            business here?

ADAM blinks.

                             ADAM
            Uh, right, um.. I'm just here to monitor
            you and collect a minor position sample.

                            SASAMI
            I'm afraid I cannot allow civilians like
            you to follow me, I have a dangerous job.

SASAMI replaces the arrow and pulls out one that looks rather normal
except for the slight bulge on one side that seems filled with a
liquid.

                             ADAM
            Haakk?!

                            SASAMI
            It'll wear off in a few seconds...

SASAMI releases the arrow as the scene slows to show the arrow slowly
moving through the air then ADAM taking a surprised step back and
waving his hand in front of him causing a blue streak to appear behind
it.  The arrow smacks into the blue streak and releases some blue/pink
liquid that falls harmlessly to the cement and evaporates.  The scene
returns to normal time.

                            SASAMI
            <soft> Demon...

                             ADAM
            Huh?

SASAMI jumps off the side of the building as ADAM looks on with a
slightly surprised look on his face.

                             ADAM
            Hey-- Whu—

ADAM runs over to the ledge and looks down.  The camera cuts to an
overhead view to show SASAMI running swiftly across the courtyard
with RYO-OHKI following.

                             ADAM
            Hmmm.

ADAM moves his arm around quickly a few times and watches the blue
field appear then slowly fade away.  He touches his armband and it
glows a green color.  A green field creeps up around him and
encircles him before shrinking to the size of a marble and vanishing
taking ADAM with it.

Cut to SASAMI running down the streets of the town with RYO-OHKI on
her head.

                            SASAMI
            Who was that guy?

                           RYO-OHKI
            I don't know.

                            SASAMI
            Do you think he's from Juraihelm? He said
            he knew me.

                           RYO-OHKI
            I don't think so, if he is, I've
            never seen him.  And if you say you've
            never seen him before, there isn't
            anything more I know about him.

                            SASAMI
            Well, he did something to my arrow,
            and I don't want to know what he'd
            do to me if he got his 'sample.'

                           RYO-OHKI
            Good thinking, Sasami.

Cut to first person view of SASAMI running down streets and alleyways.
As she approaches a fountain in the center of the town a green orb
appears right in front of her.  Cut to show SASAMI and RYO-OHKI
stumbling backwards from the green orb floating in air.  It lengthens
then explodes to show ADAM.

                             ADAM
            There you are!

SASAMI jumps to her feet and pulls out her wand to point it at ADAM.

                             ADAM
            Woah.

                            SASAMI
            Hold it right there, I don't know
            who you are, but if you come any closer
            I'll have to do something really nasty.

                             ADAM
            Hold on there! I'm not going to hurt
            you. <beat> Sasami, it's me, Adam. Don't
            you remember me?  Take a close look.

SASAMI continues to look down her wand at ADAM.  She tilts her head
and blinks a few times but eventually shakes it off.

                            SASAMI
            I've never met you before.

                             ADAM
            <sighs> Must be some glitch in the
            reality modulator. <beat>  Look,
            this isn't real.

                            SASAMI
            <blinks; flat> It isn't?

                             ADAM
            Uhh, hmm.  You're not really this
            superheroine fighting the causes of
            carelessness and anger.  You're really
            a nice girl from the planet Juraihelm
            who lives with the rest of us at the
            Masaki household.

                            SASAMI
            How did you know that?  How do you
            know my real name and my family?

                             ADAM
            Yu—your, uhh, strange world you've
            got here.  <beat> Okay, what I'm
            trying to say is you, and I, all of
            here are, trapped in Washuu's
            reality generating machine.  There's
            been a malfunction and I need to
            separate you from all the false reality
            around us.  I just need to prick you
            with this pin and that's all. <beat>
            Come on, Sasami, can't you remember?

                            SASAMI
            No. <beat> Listen up, demon, I don't
            know what you're trying to do here, but
            if you even try to hurt anyone on this
            planet, I'll come after you.

                             ADAM
            You're not even listening to me!

                            SASAMI
            I've heard enough.

A rainbow lurches from the end of her wand and strikes ADAM in the
chest knocking him to the ground.  As he moves to get up the rainbow
comes back around and wraps around him, holding him tight.

                             ADAM
            What on earth...? What is this
            magic?!

                            SASAMI
            It's so you can't hurt anyone,
            demon.

                             ADAM
            Sasami! Listen to yourself, that's not
            you, it's some false character, a fake
            created for this world.  You're not
            Pretty Sami, you're just Sasami!

                            SASAMI
            You're not fooling anyone with that
            story.  Goodbye, demon.

SASAMI turns and starts running off again.

                             ADAM
            Sasami, wait!

SASAMI enters a crowd of people and disappears.

                             ADAM
            SAAASSSAAAMMMMIIII!!!!

Fade to black.

                         WASHUU (V.O.)
            Things were beginning to get worse,
            and it wasn't just Sasami's memory.

Cut to show WASHUU typing at a shadowy console.  She pauses and looks
up.  As she turns her head a purplish hole appears behind her and ADAM
falls through landing on his face.

                             ADAM
            Washh—Puugggh!

WASHUU blinks and moves over.  ADAM falls the rest of the way down and
splatters on the floor.

                            WASHUU
            Problems?

                             ADAM
            <weak> You could say that...

                            WASHUU
            Hmm...

She pulls out a small device and uses it on ADAM'S armband.

                            WASHUU
            Interesting.  It looks like there's
            been a penetration into your isolation
            field.

                             ADAM
            Yeah, Sasami hit me with some pixie
            dust.

                            WASHUU
            Hmm.. it's just as I thought.

                             ADAM
            <cricks neck> What's that?

                            WASHUU
            The overlapping realities are beginning
            to collapse.

                             ADAM
            Uhhh.. <beat> Good or bad?

                            WASHUU
            Bad.  Unless we can get the rest of them
            isolated before the collapse.  I've
            determined that the prime reality exists
            beneath this one.

                             ADAM
            So I just have to get Rainbow Brite and
            Starlight and we'll be fine?

                            WASHUU
            Hmm... theoretically.

                             ADAM
            Aheh... alright, as fearful as that
            sounds, I trust you'll keep me safe
            if I go back in.

                            WASHUU
            <soft> Really?

                             ADAM
            <smiles> Yeah, I'll go back in.  Just
            give me a new isolation frequency.

WASHUU smiles and fiddles with the armband again.

                            WASHUU
            There you go!

                             ADAM
            Thanks. <beat; stands> Okay, beam me
            up.

                            WASHUU
            Energizing.

Fade to show a classroom.  Pan across to briefly show TENCHI leaning
against his hand while AYEKA and RYOUKO toss silent arguments across
the classroom.  Cut to show the courtyard from the roof with a few
students walking across it.  Pan back from the roof to show SASAMI,
in her Pretty Sami garb, looking out into the city.

                           RYO-OHKI
            I'm nervous, Sasami.

                            SASAMI
            Me too, Ryo-ohki.  I don't know
            what happened to that guy, but I
            just have this feeling...

                           ADAM(O.S.)
            What? Like I'll be back?

SASAMI and RYO-OHKI turn around to see ADAM leaning up against the
access door to the roof.  SASAMI pulls her arrow and RYO-OHKI jumps
onto SASAMI's head.

                             ADAM
            Will you put that away, when did you
            become so violent?

                            SASAMI
            I don't know where you went to but—

                             ADAM
            Yea, I know, don't move or I'll shoot
            type stuff.  Will you please just
            listen to me?  I'm trying to save you
            from almost total oblivion.

                            SASAMI
            What are you talking about?

                             ADAM
            Okay, listen—

He's cut off by a sudden nearby explosion that throws chunks of
shrapnel at both ADAM and SASAMI.

                             ADAM
            What the hell...?

ADAM and SASAMI look up towards the explosion to see a large crater
in the roof and an odd looking GIRL in a black tutu.

                         ADAM & SASAMI
            <sim> Huh?

The woman points at SASAMI.

                             GIRL
            Ha ha! There you are, Pretty Sami!

                            SASAMI
            Pixie Misa!

                          PIXIE MISA
            Very good.  Ready to continue our duel?

SASAMI pulls out her want and stands with it at the ready.

                            SASAMI
            Of course.

MISA goes into battle stance while ADAM looks between the two of them
strangely.

                             ADAM
            What sort of world is this?!

                            SASAMI
            I'll talk to you another time.

                          PIXIE MISA
            Yaaa!

MISA motions with her hand an a bunch of pinkish globules fly from
behind her towards SASAMI.

                           RYO-OHKI
            Look out, Pretty Sami!

SASAMI swings around with her wand and a rainbow stretches from the
end creating a multicolored field.  When the globules hit the field
the let out a short screech and then turn into powdered Kool-aid.

                          PIXIE MISA
            Very good. But lets take this somewhere
            I have a greater advantage.

MISA jumps off the side of the building and bolts off towards the
center of town.  SASAMI runs to the edge of the building and looks
down.

                             ADAM
            Very strange...

                           RYO-OHKI
            Hurry after him, Sasami!  With all
            those people around her, who knows what
            she'll do.

                            SASAMI
            Right!

SASAMI goes to jump off the edge.

                             ADAM
            Wait a minute...

SASAMI and RYO-OHKI look back over to ADAM.

                            SASAMI
            I don't have time for you now, this
            is more important that your speech.

                             ADAM
            My speech...?

                            SASAMI
            I must go now.

                             ADAM
            Wait!  What if I help you, will you
            trust me?  I'll help you capture
            the Pixie Queen in exchange for a
            position sample.

                            SASAMI
            I don't trust you.

                             ADAM
            Let me prove to you I'm worthy of
            trust.

                            SASAMI
            Um... <beat> Alright. <beat> But
            you gotta keep up!

SASAMI leaps off the edge of the building.

                             ADAM
            <shakes head> They're all nuts.
            I'm going to have to remind Sasami
            of this when this is all over.

He reaches up to his armband and taps it.  The green field surrounds
him and shrinks to a marble before disappearing.

Cut to SASAMI and MISA facing off near the fountain of before.  A
legion
of zombie-like people are slowly stomping towards SASAMI who looks a
bit fatigued and barely able to hold the wand up.

                          PIXIE MISA
            Ha! You can't win Pretty Sami, I'll
            control this world!

                           RYO-OHKI
            This doesn't look good, Sasami.

                            SASAMI
            I know...

One of the zombies lunges at SASAMI.  She jumps back just as it's
kicked aside into the other zombies.

                            SASAMI
            Huh?

SASAMI looks up to see ADAM standing beside her breathing heavily.

                            SASAMI
            <blinks> Adam?

                             ADAM
            <pants> Wow, that's a lot easier
            than in the real world.

He turns and helps SASAMI up to her feet.

                           PIXIE MISA
            Who do you think you are?

                             ADAM
            Oh, just your run of the mill hero,
            pay no attention to me.

                           PIXIE MISA
            Big words, why not try them against my
            love-love-zombies!

MISA waves her hands around and the zombie-like people begin
converging on ADAM and SASAMI again.

                             ADAM
            <nervous> Uhh.. lets not... aheh?

                            SASAMI
            I guess you're not my enemy now...

                             ADAM
            Gee, now you trust me.

                            SASAMI
            Why not just do some of that magic
            you did before?

                             ADAM
            Heh, uhh, I'm not quite too sure how
            to do that on large scale. I mean,
            I create a reality distortion whenever
            I move, but that's just because my
            armband isolates me.  I have no idea
            how to channel that into a weapon!

                            SASAMI
            Wha? Then—aakk!

A zombie lunges at SASAMI and she smacks it aside with her wand just
in time to jump aside from another zombie attack.  ADAM faces similar
attacks and manages to slap a few aside.

                           PIXIE MISA
            Not so brash now, huh?

                             ADAM
            Not fair, you have too many players!

                           PIXIE MISA
            That's okay, I wrote the rules!

                             ADAM
            Arrggh! Sasami, can't you do SOMETHING?!

                            SASAMI
            Well, maybe if I had time to concentrate
            I could come up with something...

ADAM dashes over to SASAMI and kicks away a zombie that had been
following her.

                             ADAM
            You have time.  Do something!

SASAMI blinks as ADAM stares her down.  She nods firmly and begins
chanting, clutching her wand close to her.  ADAM turns to face the
legions of zombies approaching.  Pan towards him as he swallows.

                          ADAM (V.O.)
            This better work.

ADAM glances behind and sees SASAMI emanating a strange yellow glow.
He turns back to the zombies just in time to punch one away.
Crouching low, he looks up at another zombie just before kicking it
strongly in the stomach sending it flying towards a pack of other
zombies knocking them all down and clearing a direct path to PIXIE
MISA.

                             ADAM
            <yelled> Now or never Sasami!

Cut to Sasami, surrounded by a bright yellow glow.  She opens her
eyes and stares straight down at PIXIE MISA.  She holds the wand up
in the air and swings it down to point it at MISA.

                            SASAMI
            LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE... <beat> BOLT RESTORE!

A beam of yellow and white shoots from the end of her wand engulfing
all the zombies and changing them back into normal people.

                          PIXIE MISA
            No! My zombies!

                            SASAMI
            Head's up!

                          PIXIE MISA
            <startled> Huh?

She looks up to see the beam continuing towards her.

                          PIXIE MISA
            Nooo!

The bolt engulfs PIXIE MISA and in an explosion of yellow dust, is
gone.  Pan to ADAM and SASAMI breathing heavily.  Cut to SASAMI.

                            SASAMI
            <pants; tries to be cheery> Nothing
            beats the power of Pretty Sami for
            the cause of love and justice!--OW!

                          ADAM (O.S.)
            Sorry.

Pan over to show ADAM holding up a needle to the light and then
putting it into his armband.  A close up shows it being placed
last in a row of several filled holes.

                            SASAMI
            Well, what did you do that for?

                             ADAM
            Oh, it's just that positioning
            sample I needed.  That's all. <beat>
            You... you really don't remember me,
            huh?

                            SASAMI
            Actually, you do look a little
            familiar now that I take a second
            see.  <beat> Why? Have we met
            before?

                             ADAM
            It's too complicated to explain now,
            I guess because my isolation field
            failed you didn't get the burst of
            realization everyone else did.  You'll
            probably be fine for the next switch.

                            SASAMI
            The next switch?

                             ADAM
            Like I said, it's too complicated.
            <beat> I'll see you on the other side.

He reaches up and taps a button on his armband.

                             ADAM
            All cleared up here.

                         WASHUU (V.O.)
            Roger!

The screen flashes and everything except ADAM turns to monochrome and
begins to swirl into the center of the screen.  ADAM closes his eyes
and fades away in a reddish burst of light. The background changes to
a streaming chasm that's shooting colors all over.  Everyone is here
now, they all fall to the center of the chasm.

Fade to black.

                         WASHUU (V.O.)
            The final chapter was at hand.

                       TO BE ...
                                 CONCLUDED.
