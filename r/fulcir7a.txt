                              INTERLUDE
Opening Shot: Darkness.

                         WASHUU (O.S.)
            HEY! <beat> Let's see about getting some
            light here! 

A spotlight suddenly turns on from above and centers on WASHUU.  She
has a big grin on her face.

                            WASHUU
            Alright, that's more like it.  Now listen
            up!  I'm Washuu! The greatest genius in
            all the universe!  There is NOTHING I don't
            know! <beat; softer> At least, that's what
            I thought.

The camera slowly pans inward on WASHUU's face while she's talking.

                            WASHUU
            It's really been quite hectic the last few
            days and I think it was all my fault.  It's
            not something I'd admit to openly, but I've
            had a long time to reflect upon it, and
            Adam's occasionally repulsive remarks have
            actually been getting through to me. It's
            with a bit of shame that I recount what
            happened, starting with the unveiling of my
            "great" machine.

Pan left away from WASHUU over towards the Multidimensional Time and
Space Manipulator.  WASHUU and ADAM are standing next to the machine
while everyone else in the household is watching in awe. 

                            WASHUU
            Just tell it what you want and it will make
            it for you!  No work, no regrets, Just
            PERFECTION!

Everyone starts getting googly eyes at the machine.

                         WASHUU (V.O.)
            'Just perfection' I had said.  That was a
            shot in the dark.  Not only was the device
            untested, but it relied heavily on work I'd
            done with that vile ... 'thing' Kagato.

Everyone starts saying things that are too low to hear.  Suddenly
WASHUU runs up in front of them all.

                            WASHUU
            NO!! No one gets to touch it until it's fine
            tuned.

                         WASHUU (V.O.)
            Showing it to them and then telling them they
            couldn't use it was also a big mistake on my
            part.  I should have known that at least one
            them would try something, if not Aeka, that
            daughter of mine.

The crowd disperses leaving ADAM behind.  The camera pans away into
the darkness only to pan back onto the machine. It's darker than it
was before, much of the lights that were glowing on it have gone dim.
A form approaches it slowly.

                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            Of COURSE it was her. Who else would it be?
            I don't believe anyone in the house has as
            little respect for me than her, and *I* brought
            her into being!

RYOUKO teleports closer to the machine and the lights suddenly go on.

                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            It was my surprise that she wasn't alone.

AEKA, SASAMI, RYO-OHKI, and MIHOSHI are standing behind her suddenly.
AEKA has a smug look as she looks at RYOUKO.

                            AEKA
            Soooooooo, what did you think YOU were
            doing?

                           RYOUKO
            Sneaking around in an attempt to use
            the machine before anyone else could.
            <beat> Isn't that what YOU were doing?

                            AEKA
            How could you say such a thing?  I'd
            Never think about going against Washuu's
            Orders.

                           RYOUKO
            Yeah, right.

RYUOKO turns to the machine and begins to press buttons on one of the
luminescent panels.

                           RYOUKO
            Lets see, what kind of world do I want
            Tenchi and I to have?

AEKA rushes up, followed by MIHOSHI and SASAMI, and looks over
RYOUKO's shoulder.  She starts to push RYOUKO out of the way.

                            AEKA
            What do you think you're doing?  Let me
            at it!

                           SASAMI
            Ooh! Let me!

                           MIHOSHI
            I want to try!

They all begin to hit buttons on the machine until it starts to blink
strangely and make weird noises.


                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            It wasn't designed for such violent and
            strenuous use so it therefore resorted
            to the unexpected.

They all start backing up and soon TENCHI, NOYBUYUKI, YOUSHO, and
KIYONNE are behind them.

                           RYOUKO
            Oh boy.

                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            The complete input overload shorted out
            the control matrix and eventually caused a
            cascade reaction that was unstoppable even
            if I had been there when it started.

                        WASHUU (O.S.)
            <yelling> AHHH! WHAT DID YOU DO?!

                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            Oh, there I am.

WASHUU runs on screen and stares at the mess of information pouring
out of the machine.  The control matrix begins spinning on its axis,
distorting anti-time waves everywhere.  ADAM runs up behind WASHUU
and looks around.

                           ADAM
            Damn, what happened?

                        PLUTO (O.S.)
            It's bad.

                          WASHUU
            It's bad.

ADAM spins around on his foot.  PLUTO is standing behind him.

                       WASHUU (V.O.)
            Now I can only guess what this was like
            for ADAM.  I may be the most chased after
            mind in the galaxy, but at least I don't
            have some demi-god chasing  me at all
            times.

                          PLUTO
            I warned you.

ADAM breathes out a puff of air in disgust and looks back to WASHUU.

                          ADAM
            Can we stop it?

                         WASHUU
            No, I don't think so. It's gonna discharge
            in a matter of seconds.

                       PLUTO (O.S.)
            That's what you get for disobeying
            my advice.

                          ADAM
            Buzz off Pluto!

WASHUU turns around to look at ADAM.

                        WASHUU
            Pluto?  Where is she?

ADAM looks over his shoulder at PLUTO then turns back around.

                         ADAM
            Right there.

                        WASHUU
            I don't see anything.

A burst of energy discharges from the machine and draws everyone's
attention.

                        PLUTO
            She can't see me.  I'm only here for
            you.

                        WASHUU
            We've only got a few more moments now.

                      WASHUU (V.O.)
            I tell you, it was a guessing game.  Whenever
            you deal with time, you can't be sure of 
            anything.  I really couldn't see what
            Adam was talking about, but afterwards he told
            me what he saw.

                        PLUTO
            Stay near Washuu.

WASHUU runs up and grabs the control matrix, as she does, ADAM runs
With her and is touching the matrix when it begins to disassociate
from the universe.  WASHUU looks at ADAM in surprise and annoyance
then turns to face everyone else.

                       WASHUU
            Now listen up everyone! I'm going to try
            to fix this, but in the meantime you all
            are going to be thrown through time and
            space.  Depending on how many variables
            that have been entered, it make take me
            a while to deleted all the worlds you've
            created.

WASHUU and ADAM start vanishing, parts of their body disintegrating
with the control matrix.  In a matter or seconds they are completely
gone, then a bright light flashes and everyone is seen flying though
a multicolored background that IS time and space.  It fades away to
darkness and the title appears on the screen.

                Episode 7: Time And Space Adventures

                             ACT I

Establishing shot: Darkness.  Letters slowly form on the screen in
white:

                            A E K A

The screen fades into an large sized city at sunset that casts
a reddish hue on all the houses within.  A FIGURE walks down a path
to the walls of the city.  Over the walls it can see the rooftops of
buildings and a larger castle in the middle. The FIGURE is wearing a
long coat that reaches to the FIGURE'S knees, where the end of a 
sword can be seen sticking out, and a hood which is pulled so that we
can't see the face of the FIGURE.  Over it's shoulder a bag is slung.
It stops suddenly, a small cloud of dust wavers where it's feet a 
just slid.  It looks up at the city and the castle beyond, but the 
sun seems to miss it's face, hiding it in shadows.

                            FIGURE
            <soft; coarse; muffled> What a regal 
            city, I wonder where I am.

The Figure puts it's head down and continues walking as the camera
Pans backwards and up to get a skyward look at the city.  There is
many people in the city but a galloping horse stands out, heading
away from the castle and towards the walls.

                          AEKA (V.O.)
            I've read many Earth books about old
            times when people used to fight for
            empires, honor, and love.  I really
            have no desire for an excessive
            empire to rule, but the fight for
            honor and love was incredibly
            interesting.  I wondered how it would
            be like be part of such a wonderful
            display of emotion over love and honor.

The camera cuts to a view behind the galloping horse.  A person in
black armor is at the reins while a tied up man in a formal outfit
is behind him.  He is gagged but is obviously trying to scream. The
people part in front of the horse and the gates to the city can be
seen.  The can pans around in front of the horse where we catch a
glimpse of the man who we find is TENCHI and almost has the gag off.
Around the figure we see the gates of the castle pass around him just
as the gag falls from TENCHI'S mouth and lies around his neck.

                            TENCHI
            <screaming> HEEELLP! Who are you? Let
            me go or you'll have the Queen's entire
            legion of knights after you. HELP!

Pan quickly backwards turning around and speeding up quickly before
Finally settling on the FIGURE who abruptly looks up.  We see a bit
of it's face but it can't be made out.  The figure drops it's bag and
pulls his sword out from beneath it's coat.  We see it's wearing a
form of studded leather armor under it's coat.

Cut to TENCHI and the BLACK KNIGHT.  TENCHI is still screaming and
the knight continues riding as if it doesn't hear him.  Pan over the
KNIGHT'S shoulder as it pulls on the reigns making the horse stop.
The FIGURE is standing in the road with it's sword drawn and held at
it's side.

                            FIGURE
            <muffled> You shall go no farther.

The horse moves a bit as the KNIGHT steadies it.  It draws its sword
and holds it in it's hand.

                            KNIGHT
            <loud distorted echo> Your reputation
            precedes you.

                            FIGURE
            As does yours.  Release your prisoner.

                            KNIGHT
            You cannot defeat me, stand aside.

                            FIGURE
            Even if I can't, I still must try.

                            KNIGHT
            Foolish to do with such a talent for
            the sword.

                            FIGURE
            If you fight me, your prisoner will
            escape, and if I have an ounce of
            will left in me I'll keep you from
            getting him again. <beat> It is an
            open field here, you can try to get
            past me, but the first move you make,
            I will take measures to stop you.

The KNIGHT and the FIGURE stare at each other through shrouds,
neither one actually seeing the other's face.  After a few moments,
the KNIGHT reaches back and cuts TENCHI'S ropes with an unseen
dagger.  TENCHI runs over to the FIGURE and stands behind it.

                            FIGURE
            I'm glad you chose correctly.

                            KNIGHT
            Like I said, your reputation precedes
            you.  There are not many who are as
            skilled in magic and sorcery as you.
            I could not hope to escape with the
            him even if I kill you, and he's only
            good to me alive.

                            FIGURE
            Then we'll cross paths again, won't
            we?

The KNIGHT moves the horse to pass the FIGURE, sheathing it's sword
as it passes.

                            KNIGHT
            Count on it. <beat> Ryouko.

                            RYOUKO
            Till we meet again, Kiyonne.

KNIGHT rides off down the path at a steady gallop.  TENCHI turns to
Look at RYOUKO as she pulls down her hood, pulls the scarf from 
around her mouth and sheathes her sword.

                            TENCHI
            Thank you, Sir Knight.

RYOUKO picks up her back nonplussed. 

                            RYOUKO
            I'm a knight of no land.  My name is
            Ryouko.

                            TENCHI
            Well, thank you Sir Ryouko.  I am...
            <beat> My name is Tenchi.

RYOUKO starts walking towards the city, TENCHI follows in close 
pursuit.

                            TENCHI
            What land are you from, Ryouko?

                            RYOUKO
            I'm not from any land.  My home is on
            my back and in my sheath. I live in the
            moment.

                            TENCHI
            Sound exciting.

                            RYOUKO
            It can be, if you're willing to suffer
            though the bad parts. <beat>  Ever done
            anything exciting, Tenchi?

                            TENCHI
            Yes, I've done many things I call
            exciting.

                            RYOUKO
            You don't look it.

                            TENCHI
            Well, before I was King of Camelot I
            was very adventurous. But now, I'm
            more or less stuck to my throne.

                            RYOUKO
            So you're king of this regal city?

                            TENCHI
            Oh, yes.  I thought you knew. Queen
            Aeka and myself rule and protect all
            of Camelot. <beat> Actually, I hardly
            do anything anymore, she does most of
            the work these days.

RYOUKO turns around and stares TENCHI right in the eyes.  She looks
At him as if she was looking through him.  TENCHI looks away a while
afterwards neverously and then continues walking towards Camelot.

                            RYOUKO
            She was the one who was Royalty first,
            wasn't she?  You married her, not vice
            versa?

                            TENCHI
            Yeah.  How did you know?

RYOUKO walks up to TENCHI and walks with him.

                            RYOUKO
            It's in your eyes, I see the adventure,
            the history of action.  It's so unusual
            that I see it in the eyes of a King.

                            TENCHI
            Isn't that just superstition?

                            RYOUKO
            There's a little bit of truth in every
            Superstition. <beat> It only makes sense.
            How else could something like that start.

TENCHI and RYOUKO are silent as they walk for a few minutes.

                            TENCHI
            Who else have you seen it in?

                            RYOUKO
            Excuse me?

                            TENCHI
            The eyes, who else have you seen my
            eyes in?

                            RYOUKO
            Oh. <beat> It comes and goes in some
            people.  Usually as someone reaches
            the height of their life it is quite
            obvious. There are only three people
            who I suspect it's consistent in.

                            TENCHI
            And they are?

                            RYOUKO
            A young knight who met his death not
            long ago named Gallahad, myself, <beat>
            and you.

TENCHI stops and looks at RYOUKO strangely.

                            TENCHI
            Gallahad is dead?

                            RYOUKO
            Yes he is, you knew him?

                            TENCHI
            He was a knight in my court, part of
            the round table.

                            RYOUKO
            Then I'm sorry to say that he's been
            killed by the Plague of the Gray.
            <beat> His spirit never faded though,
            even in the hands of death.

                            TENCHI
            He was brave and had strong morals.

RYOUKO keeps walking and TENCHI follows in silence.  They continue
the rest of the way in silence.  Inside the gates of the city a swarm
of armored knights engulf TENCHI and RYOUKO and eventually single out
TENCHI and quickly usher him to the castle.  Shortly after, RYOUKO is
pushed along the same route, her bag and sword relieved of her.

Cut to the inside of a room.  It's fairly big with a burning 
fireplace, a bed, a table, a few chairs, and a dresser.  RYOUKO looks
around the room unsure of what to make of it.  She looks out one of 
the windows down to the city below.  As she's looking out the window,
AEKA walks into the room in quite a magnificent looking dress.  She
Notices RYOUKO looking out the window and she subtlety cleared her
throat, causing RYOUKO to turn to her.

                             AEKA
            Madame Ryouko. <beat; bow> It is a
            pleasure to meet you.

RYOUKO looks at AEKA and nods to her.

                            RYOUKO
            It is a pleasure to meet you, your
            Highness.

                             AEKA
            Please, I have no use for any titles.
            I am Queen Aeka Pendragon. But you may
            call me Aeka. <beat> You saved my
            husband from the Black Knight.  I am
            in your debt.

                            RYOUKO
            The Black Knight will be back.  She has
            assured me.  But as long as I'm around,
            he'll think twice about trying to kidnap
            your husband.

                             AEKA
            Well then, I believe I have greater
            cause to be in your debt than I was
            originally aware of.  But I believe now
            that my Knights are aware of the threat
            that faces them, they will be better
            prepared.

                            RYOUKO
            I wouldn't put anything past Kiyonne.
            She's the best mercenary hunter in these
            parts.

                             AEKA
            You mean she was only a Merc?

                            RYOUKO
            Yes. She does not risk herself on her
            own accord, and she does not work for
            free. Sure enough, there was someone
            behind her.

                             AEKA
            Well then, this adds new light to the
            events transpiring here.  If you would
            be so kind as to join me in the Great
            Hall.

RYOUKO nods and walks behind AEKA out the door and continues walking
behind her the way to the Hall.  The hall is a great circular room
with an equally round table in the center, surrounded by several
similarly dressed knights.  Two chairs are left vacant, one on either
side of TENCHI who also is sitting at the table.

                             AEKA
            The round table. <beat>  No head, no
            foot.  Everyone is a perfect equal.
            that is the theology based behind this
            city.  No one is truly any less than
            anyone else.

                            RYOUKO
            What about your enemies?

AEKA looks a bit shocked for a moment then proceeds towards the
Table, standing at TENCHI'S left.  She looks from RYOUKO to address
the knights.

                             AEKA
            Ryouko here has informed me that the
            Black Knight has promised to return
            to get Tenchi. <beat> This puts us on
            equal footing save one thing.  We 
            don't know when she will return.  But
            Ryouko has also told me that the Black
            Knight is less inclined to attack us
            when she is around.

RYOUKO looks towards around the room as AEKA talks.  She notices
TENCHI staring at her leaning on his arm.  He immediately blinks
and turns away when he realizes that RYOUKO is staring back with
strange looks.  RYOUKO slowly turns towards the table where she
see's all the swords of the knights layed out pointing towards the 
center of the table.  One sword stands out from the rest, and it's
the one lying in the vacant spot where Gallahad had originally sat.

                             AEKA
            So I can see only one way to insure
            the safety of my husband and King.
            <beat; motions to RYOUKO> Please, take
            a seat.

An array of murmurs break out among the Knights as TENCHI looks up at
AEKA with a shocked expression and RYOUKO realizes that the sword that
stands out among the rest is her own sword.

                            RYOUKO
            My Queen, surely only a Knight should
            sit at this table. It would be
            disrespectful for me to take a seat which
            does not belong to me.

                             AEKA
            Don't be foolish.  A chair is for anyone
            to sit in.  Remember, we are all perfect
            equals.

RYOUKO sits down and realizes the myriad of possible meanings that
statement could have had.

                             AEKA
            Ryouko, it was with a heavy heart that
            I heard that Gallahad was killed.  But
            we must move on in life, and the only
            way to proceed is to put the past behind
            us. <beat>  One position is left empty.
            and God has delivered us a knight on the
            same day that we learn of Gallahad's 
            demise.

                            RYOUKO
            My Queen--

                             AEKA
            Please, allow me to finish. <beat> What
            I am about to offer you, is not a life
            of luxury, nor of easy living.  But it
            is one that makes a difference, one that
            will insure that injustice is taken care
            of in our world.  You would have to give
            up the nomadic ways that my husband tells
            me you enjoy, but there is more at stake
            now than your life.  The lives of thousands.

                            RYOUKO
            Queen Aek—

                             AEKA
            I just need the opinion of one person
            Before I offer you the chance of a lifetime.
            <beat> Tenchi, what do you think of Ryouko?

TENCHI swallows and looks about the knights before settling on 
RYOUKO'S face.

                            TENCHI
            I believe Ryouko to be an experience,
            tactical, and swift fighter.  But I back
            you up for more reasons than mere physical
            ability. <beat>  She is also moral, 
            committed, thoughtful, brave, and beautiful
            woman.  It would be a shame to loose such
            qualities just because we wouldn't ask her
            join us.

AEKA turns to RYOUKO and raises her eyebrows.

                             AEKA
            So, what do you think?  Will you join us?

RYOUKO begins to speak then pauses.  She looks around the room at the
marvelous construction and size of the place, at the table and its
amazing symbolism, and at TENCHI.  A blink of an eye later, she had
made a decision.

                            RYOUKO
            I accept.

Cut to one of the courtyards of the castle.  RYOUKO is wearing armor
Similar to the rest of the knights now.  She is pulling the straps on
A white horse, tightening the saddle.  TENCHI walks up behind her.

                            TENCHI
            Ryouko.

RYOUKO spins around and looks at TENCHI, the horse backs up a bit at
the sudden movement.

                            RYOUKO
            Lord Tenchi.  May I be of assistance to
            you in some way?

                            TENCHI
            Please don't call me that.  Call me Tenchi.
            No titles, no status, just you and me.
 
                            RYOUKO
            'an the horse.

                            TENCHI
            <smiles> And the horse. <beat>

                            RYOUKO
            You're quite an amazing person, Tenchi.
            Nobody I've met is quite like you, you're
            dynamic.

                            TENCHI
            Thank you. <beat> You too, are quite
            different than the rest. I'm glad you'll
            be with us for a while.

                            RYOUKO
            Well, it's not often someone asks me to.

RYOUKO turns to adjusting the straps on the horse again.

                            TENCHI
            You mean someone would actually refuse
            you the chance to stay somewhere?

                            RYOUKO
            You don't know me.

                            TENCHI
            I know enough about you. <beat> You're
            all the things I said about you when you
            came here. You are very brave, fighting
            that knight without even knowing who I was.

                            RYOUKO
            I've heard of the Black Knight before, I knew
            Whatever she was doing it was no good.

                            TENCHI
            You seem very moral, again for fighting the
            Black Knight just because you saw me in
            Distress--

                            RYOUKO
            My morals fail me when I truly want something.

                            TENCHI
            And you're quite possibly the most beautiful
            person I've met.

RYOUKO stops adjusting the straps and turns from the horse to TENCHI.

                            RYOUKO
            I-- uh, I'm not going to win any awards.

                            TENCHI
            But beauty is more than just physical attributes,
            It's about what's inside just as much as it
            Is about what's outside-- and you, are, beautiful.

RYOUKO watches TENCHI, not knowing what to say.

A distant scream of agony comes from beyond the castle.  TENCHI and 
RYOUKO turn towards it and run out to take a look.  When they come 
to the gates they look shocked.  A flash of fear crosses TENCHI's
expression as a trace of anger enters RYOUKO'S face.  Pan from
their faces to be behind them and see the large array of troops that
now adorn the cliffs beyond the city walls.

Cut to the army, hundreds of troops with black armor behind the BLACK
KNIGHT riding a white horse.  She pulls a sword out and points it
Towards the sky, the sun gleaming off towards the camera.  When the
light fades, the camera is a distance away from the army.

                         KNIGHT (V.O.)
            Attack the city walls and get me the
            King!

The troops all start running towards the city at once.

Cut to the inside of the castle, RYOUKO and TENCHI are watching as
the troops start running.

                           RYOUKO
            This is bad.

                         BORS (O.S.)
            Quick! Ryouko! To the armory!

RYOUKO turns and starts running down the stairs and through the
courtyard to the armory.  TENCHI turns back just in time to see the
walls being attacked by the troops.

                           TENCHI
            Real bad.

Cut to the gates of the city, some of the troops are slain but are 
still progressing.  Suddenly the gates open and legion of blue
armored knights run out and begin close melee combat with the troops.

Cut closer to the battle to focus on RYOUKO, wearing a second set of
armor slightly different than the one she was wearing earlier,
fighting with the black armored troops.  She kills several before
turning around to look back at the city.

                           RYOUKO
            <yelling> Their breaking through!

Several knights look back to see black troops running into the castle
at full speed.

                           RYOUKO
            PULL BACK!

The blue armored troops begin pulling back into the castle.  Pan
across the battle through the walls to see the BLACK KNIGHT leading
the troops through the castle.

Cut to the courtyard.  AEKA is getting up onto a horse and TENCHI is
helping her up.

                           TENCHI
            I don't see why *you're* going and
            not me?

                            AEKA
            This is my kingdom, I have to protect
            it.

                           TENCHI
            No, it's OUR kingdom.

AEKA looks at him with a tinge of shock playing on her face.

                            AEKA
            Of... of course it is.  But I still
            have to do this.  As Queen I am bound
            by honor to fight with my knights.

                           TENCHI
            <sighs> Just don't get yourself killed.

                            AEKA
            I'll try.

                         KNIGHT (O.S.)
            You'll have to try pretty hard, your
            Majesty.

The BLACK KNIGHT rides slowly into the courtyard on her white horse.
AEKA and TENCHI turn to face her.

                           KNIGHT
            Unless you want to forfeit your kingdom
            right now, in that case I'll only require
            the use of your husband.

                            AEKA
            We weren't ready for your treachery last
            time.  You'll not escape again.

The BLACK KNIGHT starts laughing behind her helmet.

                           KNIGHT
            Look at where you are!  My troops now
            run through your city, your troops are
            too busy fighting them off.  Who would
            notice me now?

AEKA pulls her sword out from the scabbard tied to the horse.

                            AEKA
            I'll never forfeit anything to you.
            you'll have to take this Camelot over
            my dead body.

                           KNIGHT
            <low; soft> So be it.

The BLACK KNIGHT reaches behind herself and pulls out a loaded
Crossbow and aims it at AEKA.

Cut to across the courtyard, RYOUKO cuts down a black armored troop
and turns to see the BLACK KNIGHT aim her crossbow at AEKA.  Time
starts moving very slowly as RYOUKO starts rushing towards the KNIGHT

                           RYOUKO
            NO!

The KNIGHT fires the crossbow at AEKA catching her in the chest and
Pushing her off the back of her horse and lands on the ground behind
it.  The KNIGHT looks at RYOUKO as time starts moving normally, she
smiles and gallops over to TENCHI, picking him up, and heads out of
the court yard.  RYOUKO rushes across the courtyard, an expanse that
suddenly seems much longer than it did before.  She looks at AEKA for
a brief moment, a blotch of red staining her blue armor, then jumps 
onto her horse and gallops after the KNIGHT.

Cut to the battle waging out front of the castle.  The KNIGHT gallops
Past it all carrying TENCHI, shortly after RYOUKO gallops in pursuit.

                           RYOUKO
            <yelling> Let him go, Kiyonne!

                           KNIGHT
            This man is worth a kings ransom! Never!

RYOUKO stands on the saddle of the horse and slowly gets closer to
the KNIGHT before leaping at him and pulling TENCHI off the horse.
The two land on the ground with a thud as the BLACK KNIGHT rides
forward a bit before turning around.

                           RYOUKO
            Shit! That hurt.

                           TENCHI
            He's coming back!

RYOUKO looks up at the KNIGHT with a looks of pain still on her face.
She stands up and tries to pull TENCHI onto his feet as well.

                           RYOUKO
            <flat> Run.

                           TENCHI
            Wha? Run? No way, I'm not going anywhere.

                           RYOUKO
            I'll buy you time, get back to the castle,
            Look for anyone wearing blue armor and get
            them to protect you.

The BLACK KNIGHT starts riding back towards TENCHI and RYOUKO.

                           TENCHI
            No, I have to stay with you.

                           RYOUKO
            Listen to me, you are a King, I am a knight,
            you need to survive and I do not.  Just go.

                           TENCHI
            I won't let you sacrifice yourself, we're all
            equals, remember?

RYOUKO turns towards TENCHI and grins.

                           RYOUKO
            I don't plan on dying, I'm going to fight to
            the end. But you don't need to be here, now,
            you're wasting time, just GO! You don't even
            have a sword! You can't stay here!

TENCHI hesitates, RYOUKO pushes him back towards the castle.  He
starts to run then stops and turns.

                           RYOUKO
            RUN, NOW!

TENCHI turns and keeps running.  RYOUKO turns back just in time to
dodge the sword of the BLACK KNIGHT.  RYOUKO tumbles on the ground
then looks up as the KNIGHT turns her horse around.

                           KNIGHT
            You've been a thorn in my side long
            long enough, Ryouko.

                           RYOUKO
            As have you, Kiyonne.

                           KNIGHT
            I've prepared for this battle.

The BLACK KNIGHT reaches into one of the saddle bags and pulls out an
Orb and throws it at the ground. It flashes yellow then starts
Glowing. RYOUKO suddenly clutches her stomach and falls to the
Ground.

                           RYOUKO
            What.. how?

                           KNIGHT
            I got that from someone named Atropos.
            She said it would keep you from using any
            of your sorcery.

                           RYOUKO
            Atropos? <beat> THE FATES GAVE THAT TO YOU?

                           KNIGHT
            Just a bit impressed?  Now get up and
            Prepare to die!

The BLACK KNIGHT charges with her sword and swings down just as she's
passing RYOUKO.  The sword cuts a gash in her arm as she moves out of
the way just in time.

                           RYOUKO
            Bastard! I don't even have a sword!

                           KNIGHT
            This fight needs not be fair.

RYOUKO jumps out of the way again as the BLACK KNIGHT gallops in her
direction and takes a swing.  This time she gets down off the horse
and starts walking over to RYOUKO.  She swings down at RYOUKO who
moves just in time and hits dirt.

                           KNIGHT
            I can keep this up indefinitely. How
            About you?

                           RYOUKO
            I'm not one to die easily.

RYOUKO barrels into the BLACK KNIGHT, knocking her over and sending
Her sword and helmet flying.  They wrestle on the ground for a few
Seconds before the BLACK KNIGHT hits RYOUKO in the face with her 
gauntlet.  She crumples onto the ground beside her.

                           KNIGHT
            Without your powers, you're a weakling.

                           RYOUKO
            <heavy breathing> Anything is better 
            than being a crew bitch like you.

                           KNIGHT
            How about being dead?

The BLACK KNIGHT pulls out a dagger from her belt and moves over to
RYOUKO.  She raises the dagger in the air and points it at RYOUKO'S
chest.

                           KNIGHT
            Say goodbye.

                        TENCHI(O.S.)
            Goodbye.

The BLACK KNIGHT looks up just in time to see TENCHI slam the side of
A sword into her chest, knocking her a good distance to the side.
TENCHI looks down at RYOUKO, who is still breathing heavily.

                           RYOUKO
            I... <beat> I told you to leave.

                           TENCHI
            I knew better than to listen.

TENCHI helps RYOUKO up and she looks over at the BLACK KNIGHT.

                           RYOUKO
            He's not dead.

                           TENCHI
            No.  I can't kill anymore. It was one
            of the reasons I'm not in the Knights
            of the Round table.

                           RYOUKO
            What are the others?

TENCHI looks at RYOUKO and their visions lock on each other.  It
seems like eternity is passing...

.....before the BLACK KNIGHT suddenly makes a sound.  RYOUKO and TENCHI
look up to see ADAM standing with one foot on the BLACK KNIGHT and a
rather serious look on his face.  He's wearing his trench coat and
has a noticeable armband that lights up with all sorts of colors when
he moves.

                            ADAM
            I was tempted to let you go, but I know
            at least one of you would regretted it.

TENCHI and RYOUKO look at each other again, then reluctantly move
apart.

                           TENCHI
            What's going on?

ADAM walks over to them, the armband turning a few shades of blue.

                            ADAM
            There's a serious problem with the control
            Matrix.  A bunch of different realities have
            been overlaid on each other, and we can't
            delete one reality until we isolate all the
            REAL people involved.

ADAM pulls a small pin out from the armband and pricks both RYOUKO
and TENCHI in the arms.

                            ADAM
            There, now Washuu can delete this reality.

ADAM taps the screen on the armband.

                            ADAM
            Okay Washuu I've got them all.

                        WASHUU (V.O.)
            Alright, hang on.

                           TENCHI
            What's going to happen now?

                            ADAM
            You'll all proceed into the next reality,
            you'll forget all about his and I'll have
            to find you all over again.  We don't
            know how many of them there are, but we'll
            keep moving until we've found the primary
            reality and shut it down. <beat> In the
            case that you DO remember all this, know
            that these realities are very real, and
            can and will affect you in OUR reality.
            don't go jumping around in front of an
            army because they'll be able to kill you.

ADAM begins to become blurry and eventually his form disintegrates
entirely as the world begins to blur.

                           RYOUKO
            Tenchi..

TENCHI looks over and holds RYOUKO'S hand.

                           TENCHI
            We'll get through this. Don't worry.
            <beat> I'll protect you.

RYOUKO starts to nod when everything melts away in a form reminiscent
of Salvador Dali.  The background changes to a streaming chasm that's
shooting colors all over.  Everyone is here now, they all fall to the
center of the chasm.
