Jinja-man The Shrine Master



BANG!
''Freeeeeze!''

The report of a gun ran through the floor. A bank clerk crouched down with 
scream, and the pieces of the destroyed light pours into her.

''Hurry! Hurry it up!''

The man with a white hockey mask swang his shotgun, and shouted. With trembling 
hands in fear, a clerk is putting the roll of bills into the big bag. A muzzle 
of COLT.45 which another robber holds is aiming at the clerk's head.

At a certain bank, Kurashiki-branch. Early afternoon. The inside was crowded 
with the officeworkers and the inhabitants in the neighborhood.
Suddenly, three armed men have rushed there. They knocked down the guard quickly 
with the club, and now, they are stealing the cash forcibly.
Fortunately, the moment they rushed, the branch manager was pushing the switch 
of the alarm system. The nearby police headquarters is already supposed to 
receive the report of the emergency. And... the siren is sounding from the 
distance.

''Hey! Here comes POLICE!''
''Damn...!''
''What to do?''
BANG! BANG!
''Hey! You all! Be HOSTAGE!''




''This is in front of the **-bank, Kurashiki-branch. The robbers made the clerks 
and the guests as the hostage, and it has been already passing for more than one 
hour. The criminals are armed with the gun, and we're anxious about hostages' 
safety. They are asking the car for the escape and the evacuation of the police. 
There is some unconfirmed information that some wounded persons are inside, too, 
and...''
''BANG!''
''N0! ...s,sorry! It's the report! Report! The report of a gun from the bank, 
...''
''BANG! BANG!''
''Nooooo! Again! What happens on earth in the...''
CLICK...
''... It seems to be my turn...''

The man of the Masaki-shrine cut the switch of TV, and stood up slowly.




The robbers made the hostage to stand up at the window which the shades were 
taken down, and holded their guns.

''My... What an aggravating.''
''What to do? ...oh, let's kill 2-3, and threaten the police!''

Hearing the words of the follower-A and B, the leader who replenishing shells in 
the shotgun laughed uncannily.

''Ha, ha! It's inevitable. ...heeeey, YOU!''

The shotgun was shaken. The middle aged branch manager trembles his body.

''He...help me! I have six children...the eldest son hasn't been 10 years old 
yet, so...''
''Shut up!''

When the leader stretched his hand to the branch manager...

''WAIT!''
''What the...!''
''The sky, The ground, The person calls me! Calling me to Judge the CRIME!''
''Where? Where is it!?''
''Jinja-man, right now came!''
''LOOK! There!''

With taking a strange pose, one old man was standing on the counter. And, the 
square glasses sparkled.
All of the members were dumbfounded. Though some lights are destroyed and the 
shades of the window are taken down, it's daytime. But, they can't see the old 
man's figure clearly by the strange backlight. And...

''Whe, where did you come into!?''
''Oh, that's small. Don't mind.''

Answered, and the man who gave his name as Jinja-man got off on the floor with 
saying ''..oops..''.

''Ha! Came to become a hostage, huh?''

The follower-A approached him with laughing. But, suddenly!

''Jinja-PUNCH!''
SMASH!
''Nooo...ohh..''

The old man's fist was given to the follower-A's stomach.

''What...!''

The follower-B turned quickly, and hold his COLT...but...

''Jinja-KICK!''
BTHOM...!
''Oh....mmmm...''

The sandal sank into the B's face.

''You...!''

Toward the leader who hold the shotgun, the old man swang his arm quickly. A 
little sound was made, and the leader felt something... The muzzle is choked 
with a nut! No one can shoot the gun under this condition. If pull the trigger, 
the barrel bursts securely!

''Who, who are you!?''

The leader threw the shotgun away, and pulled out MAGNUM from his bosom.

''So, I said Jinja-man.''
''F...foolish!''

The trigger is pulled, and hammmer falls. The bullet was pushed by the 
combustion gas of the gunpowder. And, it projected from the muzzle with the 
roar.

''Late!''

Shouted Jinja-man, and stepped quickly. When the bullet smashed a vase on the 
counter, he has already been in the imminence of the last robber.

''Wha...''
''The PUNISHMENT!''

The clenched fist exploded on the jaw. The leader's body soared to the sky high 
and high with ignoring the ceiling of the bank... and...then fell.
The Jinja-man took out a flower of the chrysanthemum from his bosom, and threw 
it on the breast of the leader. A piece of paper was being stuck in it, and, 
''This person, the bank robbery criminal.'' were being written.

''Ho, ho, ho! The affair was settled in.''

Putting the both hands backward, Jinja-man left calmly. In the place, the clerks 
and the guests (being dumbfounded) were left...




''Oh, welcome back.''

When Katsuhito returned to the Masaki-shrine, Washu is in the room with eating 
rice-cracker.

''Where did you go?''
''Well...uhhh... Just walk around.''
''Are you?''

And Washu handed over a teacup for him.

''By the way, I came for the invitation to go on a hike with all on next Sunday. 
Join us?''
''Oh, sounds good. Let me accompany it.''

Said so, and Katsuhito drank tea.

Fin.
