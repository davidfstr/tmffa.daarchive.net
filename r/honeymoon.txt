Honeymoon!
(This is not meant to be a lemon but instead has the characteristics of a
mildly sour fruit)

I could hear the waves crashing up alongside the rock cliffs Tenchi's warm
face was in nuzzled my breast. I could feel the love; the energy flowing
through our griped hands I opened my eyes to see a seagull flying overhead
so
graceful I thought kissing Tenchi's forehead floating around the Caribbean
watching people love each other.
" I love you my Tenchi" I said He is so beautiful, I'm so lucky, I wish it
could last forever, I thought to myself. Tenchi was starting to stir, and
then
lifted his head and opened his eyes to my calm face.
        "Did I fall asleep?" he said already knowing the answer. "I guess
it's
because everything is so serene and calm here."
        "Yeah" I said quietly, as I looked to the setting sun. I can't
believe that
were finally away from it all for once. And to believe we just checked in an
hour ago.
        "Tenchi, I love you so much" I said as I started to lean on my elbow
over him
"Tenchi how come it took you months to finally understand me like you do
now?"
        " I always have, but there was always to much interference and I
couldn't see
clearly but when I finally could, you were there for me." Tenchi calmly
remarked.
"Yeah I guess there were a lot of interference's."  I said as I thought
about
what had happened since that fateful day that Tenchi had decided to see what
was in that in that cave I had been locked up in for so damned long.
"I'm sorry that I attacked you on the school roof that one day, I was just
so
eccentric from getting out of that cold dark cave after so long. And kind of
mad at you because you ran away from me the very same day that you saw me."
"Well why would you be mad I didn't even know who you where when I saw you
for
the first time?" he asked me.
"Well I have known you for all of your life" I said smiling.
"You have not, I only wish you had," he said as he leaned toward me to kiss
me. "It doesn't matter how long you have known me I will always love' he
continued as he went into his deep passionate kiss. This is always what I've
dreamed of when I went onto the roof at night, this and other things. But
tonight was different; I'll be staying in tonight. So will Tenchi I thought
as
I kept kissing Tenchi even more violently.
"Tenchi, I wish we could live like this forever "
" We can, as a wedding present my Dad is building us a guest house so we can
make all the noise we want but not disturb anyone"
" Oh, Tenchi" I said as I held Tenchi like I never was going to let him go."
Tenchi, this a private beach right?"
" Yes it came with the room"
"So no one would mind if I did this," I said as I slid out of my bathing
suit.
" None of that here, Ryoko that why I got the room"
" But I just want to pose for you" I said in my most convincing tone." I've
always wanted you to be my private judge in my own 'beauty pageant'''
" Well I guess that's alright"
I started to pose for him as I always imagined doing, to express my love
without 'intercourse'. All my moves were brilliant they came from my heart.
I
felt as this was better then one of those guys who went after me because
I've
got a pretty face and more, this was love.
"Ryoko we better get to our room before it gets to dark out"
"Okay, my love" I subductively got up and slowly slipped on my bathing suit.
We slowly walked to our beach house and Tenchi pulled me up off my feet and
walked up the stairs to our room. Tenchi laid me down on the bed medium
sized
bed and the lights went off. Click.
