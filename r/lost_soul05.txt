Lost souls: act 5: lost love blues 

You're back! Im so happy:.) Well, you came to read about Tenchi so, 
read on!

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Tenchi sat on the window seat in his room. It had been 10 month's since 
Ryoko had left. He was still heart broken by her one question that 
still puzzled him
<Why did she leave? > He had been good to her, at lest he thought
^We loved her so much ^
<We still love her very much>
<Why?!^.

Ameka, now beautiful with her young age shining in her eyes, put the 
flower's her friend had gotten her for her birthday on the nearby. self 
and looked at a picture of her mother whom had her bright blue hair in 
a spiky pony tail and her eyes shut, a woman she didn't know who had 
her mouse brown hair in a messy bun and her blue eye's shined, a boy 
she didn't know whom had brown hair the same as the woman only his hair 
was short and his eyes, one blue one red, shined as well and her when 
she. was young, all smiling. For some reason this was one of the most 
important picture's she had, and some how, thou she could barely hear 
it when she does, she knows she can some times hear a voice saying
"Ill be back for you, nova" and for some reason it hurt deep inside 
just to look at her and the boy together, even thou she doesn't 
remember him
"Why are you haunting me?"
"Ameka! Come back in here! We have more stuff for ya!" she ran back to 
the room her friends where in.


Temp, now handsome and older looking, stopped and sat on a boulder (had 
anuff of the boulders?) and took a long breathe and then pulled out the 
same picture of the four Ameka had been looking at
"Where are you?" he asked him self and then swore "Shit! I have to get 
to her before Kaiun does".

     
"When are you going to let us go?" Cc asked in a tired voice 
"When you die off and I have the nova you're hiding" Kaiun said as he 
hit a button and the number's shot from 12 to 25 
"Bye, bye girl's" he said as he walked out
"We have to find Ameka before he does, or the world as we know it will 
die off before we do" Ryoko said
"No, I think we'll die first if he keeps taking our energy" Cc remarked 
"Ha ha, that's not funny Cc"   
"Yes it is"
<I wish Tenchi were here> Ryoko thought and then shook her head
^He wouldn't care ^ 


Im sorry this one wasn't as long as the others but I hope this is just 
as good!
