Chapter #3: A Change in Relationships 
As the sun climbed towards it's midpoint, everyone in the Masaki home 
were  
at their chores, except for three individuals. Two were at the home's 
patio waiting for the third,  
who was making his way towards the shrine to talk to the shrine keeper, 
his  
grandfather. Tenchi had many things on his mind as he made his way to 
see  
his grandfather. Mainly to ask for the day off to talk  
to Ayeka and Ryoko who were waiting for him below. 
"Oh, I hope he lets me off today, I really need to talk to the girls," 
thought Tenchi.  
Then an odd sight befell his eyes. He saw an adult Washu sweeping the 
Shrine's courtyard .  
"Miss Washu what are you doing?" asked a thoroughly perplexed  
Tenchi as he scratched the back of his head.  
"Well, Tenchi dear, this is part of the punishment I am serving as per 
your decision.  
Since I can't use my technology, I have to do this,....manually," and 
with a sigh,  
she continued on as Tenchi shuffled haphazardly to the Shrine's office. 
A knock greeted Katsuhito as he was reading several scripture scrolls.  
With that he got up from his low table to answer the door.  
"Tenchi, you're late!" was all he said. "Ah, Grandpa, I kinda need 
to.... take the morning practice off."  
Tenchi said nervously.  
"And why do you need that, what is more important that your Bokken 
Practice?"  
"Well, it has to do with what happened yesterday, and I need to remedy 
a situation  
that has... developed from it, if you know  
what I mean Grandpa." Tenchi then waited for Katsuhito to answer.  
"As you have already observed, I am dealing with my situation" He 
motioned to Washu,  
who was now polishing the Shrine floor within viewing distance of the 
two men and  
not looking very happy as she glared at them both."Well, you know she 
won't forget this Grandpa,"  
Tenchi said, quietly scolding him.  
"If all goes well, I will not be the one that will have to worry about 
her forgetfulness Tenchi,"  
he told his grandson. Tenchi then remembered who had put her in this 
situation and  
he sighed with concern and regret.Then he remembered too who caused 
yesterday's situations.  
"Well I hope she remembers who made my decision for me."  
"I'm sure she'll eventually remember that. I release you from your 
duties  
and practice for today Tenchi." Inside Tenchi was jumping up for joy, 
but he  
knew it would not last and soon enough his grandfather added, "BUT, 
that  
means double for tomorrow!" Tenchi sighed as he passed a now smiling 
Washu  
as he knew what that meant for him, then his mind switched to what 
awaited  
him at the foot of the shrine's steps. 
_______________________________________________________________________

As Tenchi was talking to his Grandfather, the two girls whom he was 
trying  
to get back to, were themselves in a conversation.  
  
When Tenchi had left his home both Ayeka and Ryoko went and sat down on 
the  
patio furniture to wait for Tenchi to come back for their talk. The two  
girls were sitting next to each other in two seats with a single seat 
facing  
them. After a few minutes, Ayeka finally broke the silence. "Miss 
Ryoko, can  
I ask you a question?" 
"Why so formal Ayeka, we're closer now!" said a boisterous Ryoko. 
"That is why we need to talk before Tenchi comes down from the shrine!" 
answered Ayeka briskly. 
"So what's on that itty bitty mind of yours princess?" 
"Oh, Ryoko, you!" (Shaking with anger, her fists turning white, but 
then calming down) .  
"I mean I need to speak with you about  
what might happen to us three now!" 
"What do you mean us three, I only see us two and you getting lucky to 
be with me  
to share Tenchi for one night." 
"You know very well that Tenchi wouldn't have done what we did ..... 
with both of us .....  
unless he had real feelings for ....BOTH of us!" 
Both of them stood up ready for another of their explosive fights when  
Ryoko, then Ayeka realized the truth to what was said. "Remember, Washu 
said  
that we acted without our inhibitions. That means for me allowing 
myself to  
do what we did last night with Tenchi with you." Ayeka looked at 
Ryoko's  
face to see if she understood what she said. "You allowed me to share  
Tenchi, which you wouldn't have done normally." Ayeka then grabbed and 
held  
Ryoko's hand. Ryoko looked down at their hands, then back up at Ayeka, 
it  
seemed so impossible, but she looked into Ayeka's eyes to see if what 
she  
said was true ... and to Ryoko's surprise it was! 
"Don't you see, we both allowed things to happen that normally wouldn't 
have,"  
said Ayeka in a soft whisper.  
Then something happened that Ayeka wouldn't have thought could happen.  
Ryoko slowly moved towards her rival and quietly, softly hugged her.  
A few moments later Ayeka, Princess of Jurai, was  
hugging back the Space Pirate Ryoko. 
Both girls knew what this truce meant. It meant no more fights over 
Tenchi,  
it meant that they would have to be closer to each other to help 
Tenchi, it  
also meant that they would have to share their one true love with each  
other. "That's if he lets us." Ryoko said out loud.  
Ayeka looked to her newfound friend, "What did you say?"  
"I just answered what you were thinking about." answered Ryoko.  
"How could you know what I was thinking?" said a now surprised Ayeka.  
"Because I .... could read .... your mind?!?!?" Ryoko was now confused. 
"How can that happen? We didn't ....well we didn't!" stated Ayeka  
But, we did, with Tenchi!" Ryoko started waving her arms as if trying 
to get  
across an important message without being able to actually say it, then  
running her hands through her hair exasperated. "Maybe his powers 
somehow  
linked us together because we did it!" 
"You mean when we ... you know, then we became ... linked." said Ayeka 
nervously.  
"Yeah, kinda like what my mom has with me and Ryo-oki, but different."  
"What do you mean different? " asked Ayeka 
"Well this time I could read your thoughts, but most of the morning I 
could  
only tell how you were feeling," Ryoko told her.  
"So it's not a complete telepathic link, it's more of an empathic link  
right?" answered Ayeka. 
"You got it Princess!" said Ryoko happily.  
"Well this will work well, unless.......!" stated Ayeka.  
"Unless what?" Ryoko answered in a slightly irritated tone.  
"Unless ....  he picks only one of us," Ayeka nervously said 
"From what we did last night, I don't think we have to worry Ayeka,"  
Ryoko said to reassure her friend.  
Just then as that was said, Tenchi appeared at the bottom of the stairs 
leading from the Shrine.  
Both girls looked at him, he looked at them, then seeing he was looking 
at them  
holding each other's hands, they immediately letgo. He shook his head, 
as he walked towards them.

As the three sat down the girls facing Tenchi there was an air of 
nervousness  
throughout the area as 3 pairs of eyes stared at each other. 
Finally Tenchi got some backbone and said; 
"Girls, we need to talk about last night!" 
Both looked up at those beautiful brown eyes that they both had fallen 
in love with.  
That loving look was conveyed by them back  
to Tenchi who finally understood the magnitude of the past day's 
actions. 
His hands then grabbed on of the girls hands and held them softly 
kneading them  
as one would do to one they cared for. The girls felt this immediately.  
"I want both of you to know how I feel about last night, and about the 
both  
of you." Inwardly he told himself that, 'now I will either do this 
right, or  
I'll be the poor sap between a hurricane and a tornado!' Quickly 
gathering  
his thoughts he told them, "I will never ever forget last night, how 
could  
any red blooded man!" Both girls giggled at his comment and attempt at  
levity. "I am eternally grateful to both of you for that. Thank you." 
He  
then kissed them on the cheek causing both to blush profusely! 
There was a pause before he resumed talking.  
"Now I need to tell each one of you how I feel about you!" Both girls 
nodded yes  
and then Tenchi continued."In no particular order, I will start with 
you, Ryoko."  
She let Ayeka's hand go and Tenchi held both her hands.  
Ayeka sat waiting for him to speak. 
"How can I put how I feel for you into words, you are the wind in my 
sail,  
you are the fire in my heart, just living with you makes my life truly  
interesting. I can never predict what life will be with you, which is 
one of  
the things I love about you." When he mentioned love Ayeka whimpered 
quietly  
into her kimono as if trying to hide it from Tenchi. "I cannot see my 
life  
without you Ryoko." Ryoko was ecstatic; not believing he had said the 
word  
love and her name.  
He smiled at her, then he let go of her hands quietly and took Ayeka's 
hands  
and upon seeing her tears wiped them with his hand.  
"Ayeka, I can never say how I could be more proud of you, coming from 
Royalty,  
yet being as comfortable washing our laundry  
as ordering one of the Guardians to defend us, even to protect Ryoko."  
He paused to look at Ryoko thoughtfully to convey his  
thoughts of acceptance to her.  
"You have a spirit that cannot be broken, you are my anchor of 
stability,  
Ayeka and that is why I love you too." 
"Now both girls were weeping , not tears of anger, but tears of joy and 
happiness." 
Tenchi then said; "I will be here for both of you, if you will have me 
that is!"  
Both girls latched on to him like a vice.  
"Do you mean Tenchi that you ....!" said Ayeka.  
"..... love us both!" said  Ryoko. 
"Well, ..... yeah! I love you both, how could we have done ...what we 
did yesterday  
... if I didn't love you both!"  
They squeezed him harder. "Girls.....can't breath.....Need AIR!!!!!!!!"  
They realized what they were doing and let go of him, but  
kept holding his hands. After he got his breath back he indicated they 
sit down again. 
"I want you to both know now, that whatever Washu finds out next week,  
I will not change my mind. I want you both to be mybrides."  
They both gave him long passionate kisses in turn and when  
they finally came up for air it was lunch time. They would  
have to tell the others now. So each girl took an arm and they headed 
inside  
to tell all of their love they shared together.
