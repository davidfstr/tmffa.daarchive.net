2: A Hiro's Welcome

	It was a relatively quiet ride back home on Ryo-oki. Everyone was curious 
about the man they had brought back with them from the ship, but no one said 
anything about it. Even Ryoko and Ayeka were uncharacteristically quiet. Washu 
was scanning the man to see if he was injured, but she said that she would not 
be able to get any good results until she got him onto her lab. Tenchi felt 
sorry for the guy already. He had saved him and Ryoko and now for his trouble he 
would have God knows what done to him in Washu's lab. 
	
	A while later they landed outside the house, and exited the now cute, 
cuddly battleship that was Sasami's best friend. The gang all decided to take a 
shower before dinner. They had spent the entire day in space. Washu had the 
young man taken to her lab via one of her sub-space portals. 
_____________________________________________________________________________

	Tenchi felt the hot water engulf his body as he slid down into the water 
in the onsen. The day had been a stressful one and Grandpa would surely add a 
few bruises of his own to the mix. "Fighting kidnapers and rescuing your friends 
is no excuse to miss your chores or your training." Tenchi smiled at this. Of 
course he would not really say that, he wasn't *that* unreasonable. But he was 
close. He began to think about the person that they had brought back with them. 
Washu was right, they did at least owe it to him to make sure he would be okay. 
He couldn't stop thinking about his appearance. There was just something about 
his face that reminded him of something. But he couldn't put his finger on it.

	Tenchi came down to dinner refreshed, and saw the latest culinary 
endeavors of the youngest member of the house. If it weren't for Sasami, they 
would all starve. They only other member of the family that they knew of that 
could cook was Washu. But she was never out of her lab for long enough to cook. 
Not that she would anyway. The dinner was not as quiet as the trip home as they 
all discussed the events that occurred in space that day. Sasami was most 
interested in the man that they had brought back with them. She did not mention 
the dream that she had. She never told anyone about the dreams hat she had. 
Mihoshi was in Washu's lab still unconscious. Apparently the kidnappers had used 
something that had knocked her out pretty good. But when Mihoshi was concerned, 
sleep and unconsciousness were separated by an extremely thin line. The 
conversation eventually drifted on to less important things.
	After dinner Sasami was busily cleaning up the kitchen, and with Ayeka 
helping, the two sisters would be done in no time. Ryoko went up onto the roof 
as was her nightly tradition. But tonight she was worried. She was worried about 
Tenchi as always, but she was also concerned about the new arrival down in 
Washu's lab. Something about him unsettled her. Tenchi noticed this and found 
his way up onto the roof. He saw Ryoko sitting at the top staring at the stars. 
He stopped and just stared. She was absolutely beautiful when she was like this. 
She didn't see him and jumped when he sat down next to her. 

	"Tenchi? What are you doing up here?" she asked, he did not come up here 
very often. Very rarely in fact. He looked at her and smiled.
	"It's my house," he said grinning, "I can come up here if I want to." He 
was scratching the back of his head. A dead giveaway that he was lying. Ryoko 
just stared at him with a look that said "yeah right". 'She's not buying it,' he 
thought. 

	"Nice try buddy." Ryoko grinned menacingly. Tenchi looked around.

	"Well.um.I mean." he stammered. 

	"Yes..?" Ryoko looked at him.

	"Well, I was just worried, you seem upset about something, and I wanted to 
make sure everything was alright." he said. He looked into her eyes and when she 
was sure he was being completely honest this  time. 

	"I'm not sure about this guy that we've brought back with us. I don't know 
what it is, he just gives me the creeps." She looked up at the stars. "And then 
there's always you." Tenchi looked down. She had a point. He did keep the girls 
hanging. He knew that they loved him and he knew that he cared deeply for all 
them, but he just wasn't sure if he loved them the way they loved him. He hated 
keeping them in the dark, but at the same time he didn't want to alienate one of 
the girls by choosing another. As for the guy in the lab, he did not really seem 
like a threat, he had helped them the first chance he got. 

	"I know you guys want me to choose but I'm don't know if I'm ready yet. I 
mean, you all have kind of just gotten here. I do love all of you, but I don't 
know who I love deepest, I cant just decide just like that, it has to happen on 
its own." Tenchi was looking at the stars now too. "You guys are all a part of 
my family now. And I don't want to hurt any of you." Tenchi wanted badly to 
change the subject. He felt immensely uncomfortable talking about his odd love 
life with the people involved in it.

	"I know Tenchi." Ryoko looked down. "I know how hard it must be for you, 
but I do love you. And I'm not going anywhere, but I don't want to wait forever 
for your answer." She looked at him. He was staring off into space. She felt so 
safe when she was around him. Neither spoke for a while. They just stared at the 
night sky. Then Tenchi broke the silence.

	"I think we need to give this guy a chance, I mean, the first thing he did 
was save us." Tenchi smiled warmly. "He can't be all that bad." Ryoko nodded. 

	"I'll give him a chance. But the first sign of trouble and he's toast," 
she smiled at Tenchi. Tenchi sighed.
_____________________________________________________________________________

	Down in her lab, Washu was working diligently. She could not identify the 
man that she was examining, but she knew she needed to know who he was. She went 
over the records of the battle on the ship, her instruments were always 
recording, even if she was not watching. She analyzed  the data she had gotten 
on the energy attack he had used. It was very concentrated, very powerful, and 
it required a lot of energy to use. The effect was obvious. It had totally 
destroyed its two unsuspecting targets. Then  she decided to cross-reference the 
energy signatures with others she had recorded throughout her life. She found a 
correlation. She compared it with Ryoko's energy patterns and found that it was 
very similar in some respects and totally unlike it in others. She compared it 
to patterns gathered from Ayeka's Jurai Power, and the little data she had on 
Tenchi's Light Hawk wings. Again she found one or two similarities, but nothing 
solid. She had an idea. She hoped that she was wrong but she tried it anyway. 
While the computer was compiling the data she heard some stirring. She went over 
to the bed that he was on and pulled up her computer and displayed his bio-
readings. He was waking up slowly. She totally forgot about the energy 
comparisons that she had been working on.

	"Can you hear me?" she said softly. No response. She tried again. Slowly 
he opened his eyes and she got her first real look at him. He had electric blue 
eyes, but the white of his eyes were strange, they seemed to be somewhat silvery 
in color, not totally white. He adjusted to the light of the lab and slowly 
looked around and his eyes settled on Washu. For a few seconds they just stared 
at each other. Then Washu spoke again. "How do you feel?" She looked back at her 
computer.

	"You.you were on the ship. I.I remember you," his voice was weary and 
tired. Washu looked at him and nodded slowly. She asked him again. 

	"How do you feel?" He thought for a second.

	"Tired, very tired." He took a deep breath. "Where am I?" Washu smiled to 
him. "Who are you?" He asked. His eyes were warm and wholly unthreatening. 

	"My name is Washu. You are in my lab. We brought you here after we left 
that ship you were imprisoned on." She closed her computer and turned her full 
attention to him. "Can you tell me who you are and why you were locked up on 
that ship?" She decided to get right to the point.

	"My name is Hiro. Hiro Fenikubi. I believe I was taken for something, but 
I'm not sure why." He was staring off into space.

	"You need to get some rest Hiro." Your body has taken quite a drain. I'll 
be back later to check on you." He nodded sleepily and closed his eyes. 'Well,' 
Washu thought, 'that is definitely not the way some psychotic killer acts, so I 
guess he should be okay.' He seemed dazed and not totally coherent. Not 
surprising, she thought. The boy should not really be strong enough to talk. 
Then she remembered the tests she had been running on energy patterns. She 
pulled up the latest results and froze. The patterns were almost a match. She 
looked at it again and tried to explain it. The pattern of this boy was nearly a 
perfect match to the energy pattern of the one individual that he did not need 
to be associated with, in this house especially: Kagato. She decided she needed 
to think about this new information. She checked on Mihoshi and then looked to 
make sure Hiro was asleep before she  headed out of her lab to the onsen to take 
a bath. 

	A little later, Washu was sitting in the onsen thinking about the days 
events, and about their new guest. 

	"Washu."

	"Wha!" Washu jumped. "Who's there?" No answer.

	"Washu." She spun around and froze. Standing on the surface of the water 
was Sasami, well not actually. The woman in front of her was taller, thinner, 
and more mature than the little princess. She was wearing long, flowing robes 
ornately decorated with gold and emerald leaves and petals. 

	"Tsunami?" Washu was dumbstruck. What did the goddess of Jurai want with 
her? 

	"You have some questions that I need to answer." That was the 
understatement of the century. 

	"Yeah.you could say that." Washu said. 
_____________________________________________________________________________

	Washu spent the whole of the next day in her lab. Mihoshi had woken up 
that morning as if nothing had happened. Washu was Amazed and sent her away 
before she had a chance to break something. She was running tests and more tests 
on Hiro and at the same time trying to digest all of the information that she 
had been given by Tsunami. But she was mostly trying to think of a really good 
way to tell everyone who he was that would not lead to his instant demise. He 
was still asleep and she decided to wait until lunch to tell everyone the news. 

	Tenchi had just gotten in from his work in the fields when Washu Came out 
of her lab looking very worried. "Tenchi," she said, "I need you to gather 
everyone and bring them to the lab. It's about time you all meet our guest."  
Tenchi nodded. 
	
	"Sure thing Little Washu." He wandered off to go find everyone looking 
very perplexed. 

	"Well," said Washu, "here goes nothing," and she went back into her lab.
 
	A little while later everyone was gathered around the man in Washu's lab. 
She had given them orders not to wake him up. 

	"Alright Washu," Ryoko said, "spit it out. Who is this guy?"

	"Glad you asked Ryoko," Washu answered. She was wearing her teachers 
outfit and had her I know all so don't mess with me attitude abut her. "His name 
is Hiro Fenikubi. He is the one of very few survivors of an ancient race that is 
most likely older than the Jurai." Ayeka made a little gasping noise. "Thousands 
of years ago this race was one of the most powerful ever seen on the universe. 
They controlled a vast empire that spanned the majority of this galaxy." She 
paused to let the information soak in. The group stood in awe. "Eventually, most 
of this race became evil and power-hungry. They fancied themselves gods in their 
own right. A few of them who were strongest began seeking more power. Many of 
them who were still good and pure saw what was happening and tied to stop them. 
Eventually the two sides began fighting and started a war that lasted for a 
thousand years. The vast majority of this race was totally wiped out by the war  
or merely bystanders who died in the wake of the fighting. Hundreds upon 
hundreds of worlds were destroyed by the war." The group gasped.

	"Washu, if he is one of these people, why should we allow him to stay 
here?" Ayeka asked concerned. 

	"If I may be allowed to finish," she said. Ayeka got quiet. "Right, as I 
was saying, most of this race was destroyed. Those evil that were left were 
immensely powerful beings. But the power came with a price. They lost all of 
their humanity and became mere shells of the noble creatures that they had once 
been. The power mad hunted down and killed any who sought to stop them on their 
road to absolute power. Then, mysteriously, they disappeared for millennia. Not 
one had been found until recently. This man was found by some of those loyal to 
the evil still lurking in the deep of the universe." Washu looked at the faces 
staring at her. Ryoko spoke up.

	"What aren't you telling us." She could feel Washu hiding something 
through their link. "You're hiding something, I can tell." Washu leveled an icy 
stare at her, but she did not waiver. Washu sighed. She had not wanted to bring 
this out just yet.

	"There has been another of this race seen in the last few millennia," she 
said slowly, her eyes cast to the floor. "One whom you have already met." She 
directed this at Tenchi. 

	"Kagato." He said and slowly. That was it. That is why he thought the man 
was familiar. He was from the same race as Kagato. 

	"Kagato." Washu repeated. "But don't judge Hiro because of Kagato's 
actions. Just as you, Tenchi, can't judge every human because of the actions of 
Adolph Hitler. Hiro is not evil like that." 

	"Tsunami told you that, didn't she?" Sasami asked. 

	"How did you know that?" Washu asked. Of course, she was connected to 
Tsunami. 

	"I was just wondering," she added. No one saw the look of worry that came 
over her face. She was scare that her dream might be another attempt by Tsunami 
to communicate with her.

	Ryoko was not listening anymore. She was staring at the sleeping form of 
Hiro. She could see it now. The resemblance was subtle, but it was there. He had 
sharp features like Kagato and was about the same size. She hated him already. 
'Ryoko' Washu said telepathically, 'Ryoko, I know what you're thinking and you'd 
better stop right now. Tsunami has personally vouched for him and he has shown 
no hostility whatsoever. If the goddess of Jurai says someone is good, that's 
good enough for me. I don't want you to do anything to him. Just give him a 
chance. He is all alone right now. No friends, no family, no place to call home, 
nothing. Do not run him off because of someone else's actions.' Ryoko sent her 
mother an icy glare and teleported out. With that the general mood shifted 
towards leaving.

	"Well, that went surprisingly well." And at that she went back to her 
tests.
_____________________________________________________________________________

	The next morning everyone gathered at he table for breakfast, but nobody 
said anything. They were all thinking about Hiro. If that was his name. They had 
all nearly been killed, or in Tenchi's case had been killed by this mans 
brethren and Washu was trying to tell them to teat him like a decent human 
being. It was a little much to swallow. Tenchi got up.

	"Thanks for breakfast Sasami, it was delicious." He took his plate over to 
the sink and went outside to begin his daily routine of weeding the carrot 
fields.

	"Have a good Lord Tenchi, do be careful." Ayeka waved to him as he left 
the house. Ryoko had gone up to the onsen presumably and Mihoshi was already 
watching TV. The princess watched Tenchi until he was out of view and went 
upstairs to begin her chores.

	Washu was looking over her data when she heard some noise. She turned 
around to see what it was. Hiro was waking up. He had raised himself up into a 
sitting position and had his hands behind him holding himself up. Washu walked 
over to the bed. 

	"And how are we feeling today?" She eyed him in the same irritating 
fashion that a doctor would. "Get enough rest?"

	"Yes I did. Thank you." He stretched hi back and arms and Washu caught a 
glimpse of the scar running down the back of his shoulder. He was wearing a 
greenish gray sleeveless tunic with loose gray pants. The outer jacket that he 
had been wearing over it on the ship was on the table next to him. The collar of 
the vest hid the rest of his scar. 

	"Where did you get that scar?" she asked pointing to his left shoulder. He 
turned himself so that it was hidden. Washu thought curiously about it.

	"It's nothing. Just an accident." He looked down at the floor, the walls, 
anywhere but at Washu.

	She shrugged it off and handed him his jacket, which he put on. It was the 
same gray as his pants and crossed over to one side. He swung his legs over the 
end of the table and stood up.

	"Just where do you think you're going mister?" Washu grinned at him. He 
looked back at her a little perplexed.

	"Nowhere I guess." He just looked around. He really had no idea where he 
was but it just seemed the normal thing to do. 

	"Before I introduce you to everyone there are a few things I need to tell 
you about. First, some of the people living here may not take kindly to you at 
first, but don't let it get you down. I bet you're a nice guy and they might 
just need a little time to get to know you." Her eyes wandered over the lab and 
lingered for a moment on a dark area no to far away. She smiled to herself. 

	'Damn,' Ryoko thought. 'She's seen me.' Ryoko was listening and watching 
from the shadows of the lab to what was going on to see for herself if this guy 
could be trusted. She couldn't bring herself to blindly trust someone even 
remotely related to the man who had made her life a living hell for so long. Not 
a chance. She had a feeling that Washu was talking to her more than Hiro. 

	"This family is a rather odd mix," Washu began again. "We've got princes 
and princesses from Jurai, pirates, and Galaxy Police all living together here. 
But it seems to work out." Washu turned back to Hiro who was listening intently 
to everything that she was saying. "One big happy family." She guided him over 
to her computer and gave a little info on everyone there, as well as the events 
surrounding Kagato so that he would understand the prejudice towards him. She 
conveniently left out the more personal parts involving Ryoko, as well as the 
knowledge of Tenchi's Light Hawk wings. He listened to every word she said. 
Ryoko left discreetly.
   
	Tenchi was on his way up the shrine steps to attend his training with his 
grandfather when he fell flat of his face.

	"Not paying much attention eh?" Katsuhito was sitting on a stump just off 
of the path of the stairs. Tenchi looked down at the stick placed conspicuously 
across his path.

	"I guess I'm a little distracted right now Grandpa," Tenchi winced at the 
bump on his head.
	
	"Ahh, what else is new?" He smiled. He stood up and walked off into the 
brush. "Come on then Tenchi, we haven't got all day you know." Tenchi looked at 
him. "Unless of course you're too busy worrying about that man than to remember 
how to get to the shrine," He added sarcastically. Tenchi just sat there. How 
did he know about Hiro? He just shrugged it off. Grandpa had a way of know 
everything that happened in the house. He resigned himself to his fate and 
followed his grandfather off to training.

	Down in Washu's lab their new gust was getting ready to make his big 
debut. Washu stood in front of her computer. "Any questions?" She had just 
telling him about the history of  Kagato and how Ryoko was forced into killing 
thousands of people against her will. Hiro just stared at the screen. He looked 
furious. "Hiro?" 

	"This.actually happened?" His voice was shaky. "This man did those 
things?" He slowly turned to look at Washu. 

	"I'm afraid so." She looked into his eye and saw the fury. He was not mad 
at her, he was mad that anyone would be that cruel. 'Tsunami was right. This guy 
is alright after all,' She thought to herself. He looked away.

	"I understand now. I wouldn't blame them, I wouldn't blame Ryoko for 
hating me." Washu looked at him. He was outraged by what Kagato had done to 
Ryoko more than anything else. Here she was looking at a member of a race 
capable of unspeakable horrors, and at the same time of compassion and emotion. 
She put a hand on his shoulder and turned him to face her. 

	"They can learn Hiro. They won't blame you for what he did to people. 
Ryoko may take a little time to accept it, but she will too." Hiro calmed 
himself. He looked down at the little scientist.

	"I hope you are right."
_____________________________________________________________________________

	Dinner that night was a relatively normal one. Washu had even come to join 
them. Everyone was a little more talkative than the night before and everyone 
save Ryoko was beginning to get curious about the man down in Washu's lab. Hiro 
had decided to wait until tomorrow to introduce himself to the household, since 
he needed a little time to gather his thoughts after his lesson from Washu. The 
group finished dinner and cleared the table. They had all started on their own 
ways when Washu pulled Tenchi aside. "Tenchi, I need to talk to you in the 
morning before you go out to the fields." Tenchi cringed, like Ryoko, Washu's 
"talks" usually had nothing to do with communication. "Seriously Tenchi, it's 
important." Tenchi relaxed a bit and agreed to meet her after breakfast in the 
morning. He went upstairs to bed early.

	The next morning as Tenchi was coming down to breakfast he noticed that 
Washu was absent again. She never was very stable in her eating habits. After 
Breakfast was finished he was on the way out to the tool shed when he was 
stopped by a mass of red hair. He looked down at the small scientist and slapped 
his head. "I'm sorry I forgot Little Washu." She grinned and led him through the 
door to her lab. The sounds of various experiments filled the air as she led him 
to where they had all come before. "I wanted you to meet Hiro in person before 
everyone else. You are a little more welcoming than the rest of the girls, and 
they won't listen to me if I try to convince them that this guy won't try to 
kill all of them the first chance he gets." Tenchi grinned nervously while 
scratching the back of his head and followed on. They stopped in front of a 
door. "Stay here, I'll be right back." Washu disappeared behind the door and 
returned after a few seconds. She had Hiro with her. 

	"You must be Tenchi," Hiro said, "I want to thank you all for your 
hospitality." He extended his hand. Tenchi looked at him. He had a warm presence 
and his silvery blue eyes lacked the threatening gaze that he had seen from 
Kagato. He was taller and more muscular than Tenchi, but Tenchi was not what you 
would call big by any terms. He reached out and took his hand.

	"It's nice to meet you Hiro." Tenchi grasped Hiro's hand and shook it. He 
did not get the same cold feeling that he had gotten from Kagato either. Hiro 
looked at him and smiled. Not a crooked, malicious smile, but a warm, welcoming 
one. He was glad that Washu was right. He did not seem all that bad. 

	"I look forward to meeting the rest of your family tomorrow." The man 
seemed genuinely exited about seeing the rest of the group that was Tenchi's 
collective family. 

	"I guess Washu has told you about them too then huh?" Tenchi asked. Hiro 
nodded. "I'm sure that you'll get along fine." Hiro's face fell a bit.

	"I don't want to cause any problems here. Washu also told me of the one 
like me that you called Kagato, and I don't want to upset everyone." Tenchi 
smiled a little.

	"Don't worry about them. They'll get over it. Besides, when they all first 
got here, they hated each other too, but we're like family now." Hiro brightened 
a little. Tenchi was right. He could remember the misery of living here during 
the first months that the girls had been there. The place was a constant 
battleground. It still was most of the time but it was all in fun. A very lethal 
sort of fun. The two started talking and Washu backed away quietly, pleased that 
Hiro was being received so warmly. 

	'They won't ever listen to me, but they'll never doubt Tenchi,' Washu 
grinned her mad scientist grin and watched the two men talking. 'Besides, It'll 
be nice for Tenchi to have another guy around to talk to. Of course this could 
make the female population a little more interesting too.' Washu cackled 
gleefully and sat down with her computer. Hiro had asked to help with Tenchi's 
field work and was graciously welcomed. 'Excellent.'

	Once Tenchi was sure no one was around, he had snuck Hiro out of Washu's 
lab. He was confident that Hiro was harmless and if one of the girls saw them 
leaving alone, they would be sure to keep a very close eye on them. After Tenchi 
had taught Hiro the basics of weeding, the work had gone by incredibly fast. 
They had talked about life with all of the women that Tenchi lived with. Hiro 
was impressed by Tenchi's ability to keep his sanity. Tenchi decided that now 
would be a good time to introduce him to the group now since they had a little 
while before Tenchi's training. The two walked back to the house with a couple 
of baskets of carrots and put them in the shed. Tenchi led Hiro into the living 
room and Tenchi went to get everyone. They all went ballistic when he had told 
them that he had met Hiro alone that morning, and even more so when they found 
out where the two had been all morning long. It took a little time to get them 
quiet but Tenchi managed it and introduced Hiro to the group. 

	"Guys, this is Hiro Fenikubi, our new guest," he gestured towards Hiro who 
bowed and said hello. "Washu introduced us this morning and he a very polite 
person." Tenchi looked at Ryoko who looked a little apprehensions. Hiro looked 
at Ryoko and smiled, and she averted his gaze. She still did not like the idea 
of having him on the same planet, let alone the same house as her Tenchi. It was 
too dangerous. Everyone took turns introducing themselves, albeit at a little 
distance, which Hiro understood. The last person was Sasami, who walked right up 
and shook his hand. He was fascinated by the kindness of the little princess. 
Washu had not told him of her relationship to Tsunami, plus, she had known that 
he was friendly from what she saw in her dreams. 

	Tenchi had professed his need to go to the shrine for training and Hiro 
had expressed much interest in watching. None of the girls were up willing to 
leave him alone with Hiro, so they decided to make it an outing.

	Up at the shrine, Tenchi went about his training as best he could with all 
of the spectators. Katsuhito had been pleased to finally meet Hiro, who showed 
as much respect as he could. The training ended and they were all ready to head 
back to the house for lunch when Ryoko stopped Hiro.

	"You wanna have a go at it?" It was more of a command than a question. 
Tenchi started to protest but Ryoko ignored him. Hiro looked straight into her 
eyes. Tenchi turned to him.

	"I have no reason to fight you, or anyone else here," he said calmly. 
Ryoko straightened up. She formed her sword and blocked his path to the stairs. 
The rest of the group watched nervously. "I'm not a threat to any of you. I have 
no reason to be." 

	"You don't have a choice," Ryoko said flatly. Her tone left little room 
for argument. Tenchi turned back to Hiro. 
	
	"You don't have to do this." Tenchi desperately wanted to avoid further 
destruction of the place. Hiro considered this for a moment.

	"Don't worry Tenchi." He was still locked in a stare with Ryoko. "I can 
promise you that no harm will come to Ryoko." The group took this as their cue 
to clear out. "Ladies first." Washu stood a little nervously as her daughter was 
getting ready to fight the man Tsunami had promised was not dangerous.

	"Very well then." With that Ryoko took to the air. The people on the 
ground dispersed. Katsuhito stood nearby watching with great interest. Ryoko 
flew across the grounds and landed facing Hiro, who had not moved. He bowed to 
Ryoko and stood facing her, totally still. Ryoko let loose a blast straight at 
him. He ducked under it and rolled to one side with blinding speed. Ryoko 
charged him with her sword. He leapt away from her and landed with his side to 
her, in a defensive stance. She unleashed another attack at him, but this time 
he did not dodge it. To the surprise of everyone watching, he stood straight up 
and put his hand out in front of him. The blast detonated inches from his hand. 
He was completely unharmed. Ryoko froze. 

	"I guess you aren't playing around then huh." It was not a question. "I am 
not a threat, but that does not constitute weakness on my behalf." He put his 
other hand out. A strange glow came from his hands and a band of energy formed 
between them. It looked exactly like Ryoko's sword, except it was green, and 
nearly three times as long. He grasped it like a bo and stood ready to continue. 
Katsuhito took stock of this and silently nodded. Everyone nearby was staring at 
them in awe. Ryoko got ready to start again and charged. She brought her sword 
down fast and hard. She was going to show this guy who was boss. But he was 
ready. He brought his bo up to block her attack and swung the other end around 
to Ryoko's undefended side. She phased backwards a few feet and swung again, 
faster this time. The air was filled with sparks and the sound of the two 
dueling across the shrine common. Ryoko thrust at his head but he dodged 
sideways and blocked with the middle of his bo. He spun the blade around hers 
and propelled her away from him. As she was coming back around he ducked under 
her and blocked the side slash by Ryoko. She kicked her speed up a notch. To the 
onlookers they were blinding. Ryoko seemed to have the upper hand. Katsuhito 
noted his, but Hiro was blocking every attack. Either he was a very poor 
fighter, or he was very smart. She brought her sword down to his unguarded left 
leg and he was forced to rotate the bo around to block it, leaving his chest 
temporarily vulnerable. She pressed the advantage and planted an energy blast 
into his chest sending him flying backwards. He hit the ground and his bo 
disintegrated. She was on top of him with her sword only millimeters from his 
throat. 

	"I concede, miss Ryoko." Katsuhito applauded. Ryoko backed away and 
dismissed her blade as Hiro got back to his feet. The group was stunned. Ryoko 
nodded with satisfaction as he bowed out of the battlefield. With all the 
excitement, they decided to return home for an early dinner.

	"Wow! That was really exciting!" Mihoshi said. "They were really fast." 
Everyone just looked at the blonde. She had a knack for stating the obvious.

	 Katsuhito stopped Hiro on his way down the stairs. "That was very 
impressive. I must say you handled yourself very well. Ryoko is not one who is 
easily trifled with." Hiro nodded.
	
	 "She would not have ever have accepted me unless she beat me." He 
responded.

	"So you let her win?" Katsuhito eyed him with a look that feigned 
ignorance.  

	"If I had beaten her she most certainly would have been more hostile than 
before. But I was working for it." Hiro looked down the stairs towards the rest 
of the bunch. 

	"She is a very strong woman." Katsuhito was talking about Ryoko. Hiro 
turned back to the old man.

	"She is that," he said softly. He returned his gaze to the group, now 
nearing the bottom of the stairs. He was looking for Ryoko. "She is that."

	Tenchi came up behind Ryoko. "You don't have to be so hard on the guy. 
Give him a break." Ryoko stopped. She looked straight into his eyes.

	"Tenchi I don't want anything to happen to you." She put her hands on his 
chest. "I needed to show him that he can't hurt you while I'm around." Tenchi 
looked into her golden eyes. They showed nothing but love.  

	"I don't think he's gonna hurt anyone. Besides, you beat him didn't you?" 
Ryoko thought for a second. 

	"I guess." She let Tenchi guide her to the house. 

	"Wow! Ryoko beat him, didn't she Washu?" Sasami was tailing the scientist 
with Ryo-oki perched on top of her head. 

	"That was no fight. Ryoko was testing him to see how strong he is." Her 
eyes narrowed "She's to stubborn for her own good." Washu answered more to 
herself than to Sasami. They all went in for lunch while Hiro stayed on the 
mountain to talk with Katsuhito for a while. They did not see him again until 
dinnertime. He came into the living room where everyone was. Ryoko looked at him 
momentarily before phasing over to Tenchi. Hiro smiled at her. Sasami came in to 
announce that it was time for dinner. They all filed in to sit down. Hiro was 
given a seat next to Washu. She seemed to be the only person who was comfortable 
around him yet. Sasami brought in the food and they all dug in. Hiro sat quietly 
and watched before he did anything. He wanted to make absolutely sure that he 
would not offend anyone. It was his first day with these people and he had 
already fought with one of them.

	"This is absolutely wonderful Sasami!" He was trying some of everything. 
They all seemed amused at how enthusiastic he was. 

	Sasami giggled. "Thank you. I'm glad you like it." They got a kick at how 
amazed he was at the abilities of the small girl. Everyone seemed to warm up to 
him after that. Even Ryoko had to admit that he was pleasant to be around. All 
in all it had been a rather busy first day on earth.
