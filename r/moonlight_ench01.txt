Two young girls has mysteriously appeared in Okayama, Japan, and ends up
staying with Tenchi and company.

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the Tenchi characters, they belong to
Pioneer and AIC, and whoever created them. The rest I do own or someone has
given me permission to use theirs. I am also writing this for entertainment
only, and do not wish to make a profit off this fic, so don't sue me,
please.(Not like I can afford it anyway)

Notes: I always give a brief overview of my stories just to be convenient. I
have use of my first name, but it's not entirely a self insertion. I just
have a friend named Julienne and I thought I could dedicate this to her.
Well the Masaki house hold was having their 'typical' morning and Julie
suddenly found herself, along with myself, in the middle of two rivals,
unfortunately and literally, get blown away. Even if I didn't mean for a
self insertion, I didn't mean there won't be one. I'm Jewel or Jewels (I
have various nicknames, mostly associated with Jewel.) and in the fic I'm
her twin sister, and I'm the one who got ourselves into this mess anyway so,
Miss Jewelie has to figure out how to get her twin sister and herself home.
Well, I'm going to quit explaining everything before I take up the whole
story line.

        "Hey! Leave Lord Tenchi alone, you-you- Devil WOMAN!" Princess Ayeka
demanded
"Come off  it Ayeka! Can't you see that Tenchi and I are in love. Right
Tenchi?" Ryoko said to an afraid/angry/and cofused all at the same time,
Tenchi.
"Ryoko..." he began.
"Haha, see, he would never love a monster woman like you."
"Ha! Like he would like a princess enrolled in the Itty, Bitty, Titty
Comittee." this had hit the wrong button and caused the bomb to detonate
"WHAT DID YOU SAY!"she demanded
"I said he wouldn't like a princess enrolled in the Itty Bitty Titty
Comittee." the demoness repeated. Ayeka, very insulted, yet enraged,
concentrated until logs surounded the combatants. Ryoko remembered a threat
from Washu about the next time she was around after a disasterous attack,
how the mad scientist would do all sorts of experiments on her. Ryoko
teleported leaving an even more enraged Ayeka, fuming and still charged for
attack.

*USA <The States>, Somewhere in the state of Mississippi*

        15 year old Julie Breckrayson was sitting on her porch swing,
swinging
moodily after arriving from an old friend's funeral. She had wore her golden
brown hair in a pony-tail, and a sophisticated but simple black dress, and
around her neck was a miniature gold crusifix which was her inheritance from
her dear friend. Funny, she didn't cry, not even when she saw her best
friend, Ladia Nelson, ran over, head on, by a drunk driver. She didn't even
cry as they told her that Ladia was dead, she never did. She doesn't even
remember crying at all, she didn't cry as a little girl, especially after
her mother, father, and older brother were killed in a plane crash with only
her and her sister Jewelie as the sole survivors. Her life was just one
crash test after another. Everyone that she held  dear in her heart, besides
Jewelie, was killed in some sort of wreck. Jewelie was like that too, not
crying when the moments are those when people end up breaking down. She
sighed. Jewelie and herself had gotten something out of the plane wreck,
something  strange. Jewelie had claimed she recieved spiritual power, and
Julie has been having psychic dreams and revelations. Strange indeed but she
doesn't have them but once a year and they are usually warning her about pop
quizzes in Pre-Algebra, or if she's gonna embarass herself. And Jewelie,
well  what I meant about spiritual power, was that she was a witch, wiccan
to be exact, but not as into it as you would see in movies. Sure she chants,
but that helps her relax, and she's probally doing it right now.*Meanwhile*
        A girl with a similar description as earlier but with glasses, and
dress, white on top and black on bottom with black and white daisies
embroidered around her waist to separate the colors (not very witch-like at
all), was sitting in her room . She was reading a book on mythical chants
and prayers<Which is not recommended by any witch, but people use them
anyway> and was going to pick up one on modern magic. She only read them for
entertainment, but never practice any spells but she did chant, but to
relieve grief and stress, like after today. She was close to Ladia as was
her sister, and like her sister, she never cried. Pain and loss, she did
feel, grief and stress all included in a four for one special, package. She
picked up the modern magic book. <Yeah, kind of like that deal on toothpaste
at K-Mart <mocking a department store announcer>"Attention all K- Mart
shoppers! We are now having a four for the price of one special. Pain, Loss,
Grief,and Stress, for only the price of one, a great deal!" Yeah what a
WONDERFUL deal, now I can add those along with Misery, and have a better
deal than before.> she mocked in her thoughts. She skimmed through her new
book and found something that sparked her interest, she read the topic aloud
"Teleporting, Transit Spells and Incantations." She continued reading
" To teleport, you must have a strong mind and good concentration, and above
all, comeplete faith in yourself. Transit merely means movement, or travel.
There are only three ways you can master teleportation. One, is the
ceremonial way with candles, special chanting, certain clothing, the second
is incantations, which are just a little concentration, a lot of chanting
and a little faith, except that you would have to chant, and concentrate for
two days without sleep."
               " The third, however, deals with two people, one to
concentrate on the destination, and the other to chant, and both people have
to put a lot of concentration, and faith. But this method usually gets
people no where these days, because of the lack of concentration, and
seriousness." She was getting into this book and suddenly a thought struck
her mind. <Julie has good concentration, as do I, and I can do the
incantation.> she changed out of her funeral clothes and changed into her
JNCO's and a tight fitting T-shirt <the girls are both well attributed> She
ran outside and found her sister swinging in the porch swing.
" Hey Jules, what do ya say that we go on a trip to get our minds off from
things?" she asked.
"Oh? Where? To Memphis?"
"No, another country, like let's say...umm...Japan?"
She recieved a strange look from the green colored eyes.
"Or we could go anywhere else, it doesn't matter where, as I long as you
go." she added
"Have you comepletely lost it? You know that we can barely afford going to
the grocery store, just to buy two days worth of groceries. How do you
expect to travel all the way to Japan without cash.?"
"We can teleport." this caused Julie to check her only living relative's
head for a fever. "Ohh, great, Now I really know you lost it, well not like
you had anything to lose in the first place. Poor sister, you're taking
Ladia's death harder than I am."
"No Julie, I really mean it. We can teleport with your psycic powers, and
mental stability, and my concentration and chanting , and the same mental
stability." Julie just shook her head.
"Jewels, with the way your talking, I seriously doubt it. Now why don't you
get some rest, or go to your room and chant or something."  Jewelie shook
her head "Julie, just trust me. I tell you what, we can try this, but you
have to concentrate on our destination and have a lot of faith in this to
work out, and if this doesn't work, then you can sign me up for a mental
instintution." Julie thought for a moment, about whatever it was popping up
in her sister's head, <who knows what?>
"Ok, deal." Jewelie smiled that 'You won't be sorry you chose to trust me'
smile.
"Great, and I will take you up on that offer about rest and you can get
ready."
Julie nodded and went to her bedroom and thought <Why me?>

**********************************************************************************
*Masaki Shrine in Okayama Japan*

        Tenchi was out in the fields, while the girls were cleaning up and
doing
chores, excluding Ryoko, and enjoying life. Sasami was in the kitchen with
Ryo-oki on her head, and a butcher knife in her right hand. She was making
lunch, like always, and hummed through her duty. Mihoshi was sweeping the
porch steps, but fell asleep in the process, Ayeka was working in the
garden, Washu in her lab, and Ryoko was just lounging around on the roof.
Sure it was peaceful now, but later on it will all change, like Ryoko and
Ayeka getting into it over something or a certain someone. He sighed <might
as well enjoy it while it lasts.> he thought. An hour later as he was
enjoying the peace, he felt two arms wrap around him in that all too
familiar aggressiveness, and he's doomed.
"Tenchi..." the cyan haired woman asked in her best seductive voice, "...how
about you and I go somewhere private, like the cave. I'll be alright as long
as I got my Tenchi there with me."
"Ryoko..." he was cut off by her seductive voice (no matter how bad the
situation is, it's effects are working hard onto his hormones pretty good.)
"Oh don't worry Tenchi, I won't rape you"
"Really?" he was nervous "Really, I want you willing."
"Now Ryoko..."
"Come on Tenchi."
Tenchi kept struggling with Ryoko, until Ayeka arrived and was disapproved
of Ryoko's display of   affection. All hell broke loose.

**********************************************************************************
*Back in The States*

        Julie was wearing her hair in it's pony-tail, and a snug white
t-shirt,
with baggy jeans. Jewelie held her bangs back with a head band, and was
gathering her things into her back-pack
purse, while her sister proceeded to do the same. They went to the woods
behind their house, and held hands. Julie concentrated on the destination,
while Jewelie chanted the incantation to the spell. Julie was about to give
up until she felt some sort of cold rush then heat. She realized that
whatever nonesense Jewelie said, wasn't nonsense at all. She was enjoying
the trip also, as she felt the sensations run through her body.
***********************************************************************
*Okayama Japan.*

        "LEAVE LORD TENCHI ALONE!!!!" Ayeka yelled.
"But princess, surely you can see that Tenchi and I are in love."
"Ha! By the way his face is red, I won't believe it."
"Of course he's red, he feels so much pleasure, we were just gonna relieve
him of that problem, weren't we Tenchi?"
"No, we were not!"
"Aww, come on Tenchi, you would enjoy it, I swear."
" You heard him you Monster Woman, now go away." Ayeka demanded
"Why should I listen to a under developed, spoiled princess?"
"Did you just call me under developed?"
"Hmm, yep." Ayeka was shaking with rage and after that she had logs
appearing around her and Ryoko. "So the little princess wants to play, eh?
Well I shouldn't disappoint her now should I?" Ryoko concentrated until a
ball of energy formed in her hand. As the two were about to blast each
other, a flash of white light then two girls were between them and were hit
by the blasts.
        Washu had the two girls in her lab on a examining table, and was
currently
checking their DNA to identitify the unconscious girls. Tenchi, Ryoko,
Ayeka, and Sasami were with her, curious about the identical guests. Washu
just typed in a command and on the large computer screen, green words read
                            Identifying Lifeforms: Identity Range 20%
comepleted.

"Okay just give it 5 minutes and soon we'll know who these two are." Washu
informed.
"Umm, Miss..." Ayeka received a glare from Washu "I mean Little Washu..."
Washu smiled "...is it possible you can find out someone's identity by their
DNA?
"Ah, but of course Princess Ayeka, it makes up who you are. And since
everyone has their own  DNA sequence, it's easy to identify a person."
"I know that, but are you sure it can be done that way?"
"Of course I'm sure. Regular medical doctors do it whenever they are trying
to identify a body, an comatose, or an amnesia patient, so they can contact
whoever the patient stays with and inform them of the  incident that killed
the person or knocked them them out. So if mere doctors  can use it, then it
shouldn't be a challenge for 'THE GREATEST  SCIENTIST IN THE UNIVERSE' now
should it?" everyone had a bead of sweat on their heads after her big ego
speech. They paid attention to the large computer screen, which was finished
identifying the two girls.

Identification: COMEPLETE
Tapping into files: COMEPLETE
Recuperation sequence: 90%
Minutes left to Recuperation: 10
Identify: Ready
"Okay, now. Lets just get their names and medical history, then we will have
enough information to feed my files on the interesting people we encountered
since staying here." Washu tapped a few keys then read

Jewelie and Julie Breckrayson were the sole survivors of  a plane crash
that instantly killed their parents, and older brother, plus a numerous
amount of other passengers. They both suffered head injuries but turned out
healthy. They were living with their grandparents on their mother's
side, until they passed away 7 years after the accident. They stayed at a
home for orphaned teenagers until they showed they were as responsible as
adults, then they were granted a place of their own. They then worked at a
cafe owned by the owner of the 'home'
and lead a regular life.

        Everyone nodded their heads at the information that they recieved.
Washu
copied the files into her computer then checked on the girls. One of them
woke up, and groggily raised into a sitting position then studied her
surroundings.
" Where in Heaven's name am I?" she spoke in English. This caused the others
in the room to be confused, except Tenchi, who studied English in school.
"She wonders where she is." Washu thought for a moment then typed something
in her computer. This caused time to stop and the girl froze, then Washu
walked to the girl with a small, white capsule, with her trade mark crab on
it, and gave it to her and her twin sister. After Washu gave them the
capsules, she snapped her fingers and time went back to normal. The girl
looked at the people around her
"Where am I?" Everyone understood her, Washu answered
"You are in my lab." the girl shook her head
"No no, what area, country?" Tenchi answered
"You are in a lab that is placed in my house, which is in Okayama, Japan."
The girl looked shocked at first then deliriously happy
"Did you just say Japan?" everyone nodded she was even more estatic
"Julie, Julie, wake up! We did it Jule, we did it!" she shook her counter
part until she woke up dazed and groggy
"Hmm, please... lemmee sssleeeeep...don't feel good" the girl said laying
back down.
"Jillie Bean, please just, get up." the sleepy girl stirred around in her
spot and finally mumbled
"Ohh ookay, I'm up, I'm up..." she sat up "...what is it now Jewel?"
"It worked! The teleportation, transition, incantation worked!"
Julie was now awake "Are you sure?"
"Well look around you." Julie looked even more shocked than before
"Jewelie, I think we both need professional help." she finally said. "I have
always thought that myself." the twins turned to see the owner of the voice,
who was Tenchi, who added
"Oh, my name is Tenchi Masaki, and this red headed girl here is Washu, The
greatest scientific genius in the universe, and the cute little blue haired
girl is Sasami, and the purple headed woman is her sister Ayeka, and the
cyan haired woman is Ryoko with the cabbit, Ryo-oki"
Sasami was the first to greet the twins "Hello, it's nice to meet you." the
girls nodded
Ayeka and Ryoko just waved while Ryo-oki just miyahed her greeting, and
Washu explained everything.
        Everyone finally got out of the lab, and gave the two visitors a
tour of
the house. After the tour, Sasami went to cook dinner while Ayeka helped.
Washu went back to her lab, Ryo-oki was with Sasami, and Ryoko was talking
to the girls."So you learned to master teleportation?"
"Yeah, but we had to put everything we got into getting from here to
America" Julie said cautiously taking a sip of green tea, since she was used
to Lipton's Iced Tea, but she found this tea delicious. "Mmm, I'm used to
orange pekoe, or regular American tea, but this stuff is good." Jewelie
looked up from her cup "You should try chamomille herbal tea, it's soothing,
and besides, mother used to drink it. She said that it gave her a sense of
...calm." she sipped her tea.
"So that's why you drink it. I always thought that it was part of your
spells." Julie admitted
"I never did practice those spells, well that is until I had found that
teleportation spell. I thought that I could get away from our pathetic way
of life, and grief, and just visit a whole new country, well, here we are."
"Yes but we were blasted."
"Yes true, but we didn't know where we were going to end up, and these
people didn't know that a psychopathic witch and psychic in denial were just
going to pop up out of no where in the middle of two young women's fighting
now did we?"
"No"
"Okay then." Ryoko just shook her head. The girls were chatting until
Nobuyuki walked in after a long days work, and spotted the two guests, and
shook his head thinking how Tenchi is growing so quickly, and has all these
beautiful women around him. He walked upstairs to put up his brief case and
to prepare for a bath. Later, it was time for dinner, and Yosho decided to
join  them tonight, and met the house guests.
"So, you teleported here from America?"
"Yes, Mr. Masaki, I'm a spiritualist worker, or witch as some people call
them, but I haven't practice any of it until I found the teleportation
spell, and now I'm here." Jewelie explained.
"Very interesting, but please, call me grandpa, everyone else here does."
"Okay grandpa.
"How old are you young ladies?"
"Well considering the fact that we are twins, we are 16years old and 6
minutes apart from each other." Julie said "Jewelie is the oldest."
"When were you born?"
"November 22, 1984, Thanksgiving Day in America."
"Hmm, November, 1984. You were born 1 year before and 11 days after my
daughter Achika, Tenchi's mother died. Where are your parents? Surely they
worry about you."
Jewelie looked down at her sushi while Julie sat waiting for her sister's
answer
"They died, in a plane crash along with my brother. We survived and lived
with grandparents until they died. We lived in a home for orphaned teens and
was granted a home on our own for being responsible as grownups."
"I'm sorry to hear that" Nobuyuki said, Jewelie smiled. Everyone expected
tears to be in her eyes, but were shocked to see none.
"The most ironic thing is that speaking of funerals we just attended a
friend's, who was ran over, head on, by a drunk driver. She died in an
accident like my parents and brother." Julie added holding her crusifix.
"Well, I'm glad that we were graced by more lovely young ladies' presences,
I hope you are able to stay, because I'm sure we can make room for you
here." Nobuyuki offered
"Yes, I'm sure, from what Tenchi told me, that after that blast, you will
not be fit for travel, so you might as well take a vacation here." Yosho
invited. Jewelie thought for a moment and agreed. "I guess that we don't
have choice, so sure, why not?" Sasami's face lit up into a smile while the
other's nodded in approval. Nobuyuki, who was always emotional these days,
commented "Well Tenchi, looks like all the boys in your school would be
jealous of you, for having such beautiful ladies staying at your house."
"DAD!" Tenchi scolded
"Speaking of ladies, is Mihoshi supposed to be returning from her patrol?"
Ayeka asked. Then suddenly a crash was heard from outside.
"You had to ask?" Ryoko torted
"Well can't always have luck on your side." Yosho said.
"Guess not." Tenchi sighed.
