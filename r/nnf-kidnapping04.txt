No Need for a Kidnapping: Chapter 4
By Chibi-C

Author's notes: Here is chapter 4!
Kyinia: (Cries.)
What's the matter, muse?
Kyinia: THIS IS SO SSSSSAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You think so?
Kyinia: (Sniffle.) Mm hmm!
YAY! Mission accomplished!
Kyinia: Heero (from Gundam Wing) is starting to rub off on 
you.
Hey! You just gave me a great idea!
Kyinia: I did?
Yeah! After this, I'm gonna write a Tenchi Muyo/ Gundam 
Wing crossover!
Kyinia: (Runs and hides.)
Wonder why she did that?.Oh well, on with the fic!

Anatio watched in delight as Tenchi and Ryoko struggled to 
keep the androids under control. They had only destroyed 
seven of them and were already starting to get worn out.

Pity, really. I would expect so much more from a Jurain 
prince. Oh well, just makes my job easier.

"Ryoko, look out!" Tenchi shouted.

"Gotcha!" She shouted at the android as she sliced it in 
two with her sword. "Hey, Tenchi, this is kinda fun!"

"If this is your idea of fun," Tenchi shouted as he avoided 
a few blasts from the remaining androids, "I'd hate to see 
your idea of danger!"

Ryoko turned around and attempted to destroy another 
android with her saber, but it avoided her just in time. 
"Damn, these things are fast!"

"So glad you approve of them, Miss Ryoko," Anatio said 
smugly.

"First the androids, then you, asshole!" Tenchi shouted

"Such naughty language for a prince!" Anatio said.

Tenchi decided to ignore him. He was having a hard enough 
time as it was. Just then, he heard Ryoko shout his name.

"Tenchi, behind you!"

"Wha-?" The next few moments seemed to go in slow motion 
for Tenchi. Before he realized just what was going on, he 
felt a body slam into his. Next thing he knew, Ryoko was 
lying on the ground, blood starting to pool around her.

"RYOKO!" Tenchi's eyes flared in anger at the sight that 
greeted him. Within a matter of minutes, all the androids 
had been destroyed. He then turned his attention toward 
Anatio.

"YOU! DIE!" Tenchi was suddenly surrounded by a strange 
light. Just then, four angel-like wings appeared on his 
back.

"The light hawk wings!" Anatio shouted. So the rumors were 
true.he thought. Ah well, no matter. I will destroy him 
anyway.

Tenchi pulled out Tenchi-ken and stood in a battle stance. 
Anatio pulled out his sword and stood in a similar 
position. They began their fight.

At first, it appeared that Anatio was getting the upper 
hand. That was when Tenchi spun around and, in one graceful 
move, knocked Anatio's sword out of his hand.

"This battle is over, Anatio." Tenchi said in a voice that 
could freeze a desert.

"For now. We shall meet again, Masaki!" With that, he 
disappeared into thin air. 

"Where did he." Then he remembered Ryoko. He ran over to 
her and checked her pulse. Weak, but still present.

"Hold on, Ryoko." He pressed the button on his wrist 
communicator. "Washu, it's Tenchi. Ryoko's injured. Get us 
home now!"

"Got it. Hold on to Ryoko." Washu pressed the button on her 
teleportion machine. After a few seconds, the two of them 
appeared in her lab.

*****
For the second time that day, Tenchi was pacing back and 
forth in front of Washu's lab. The others were sitting 
down, either on the couch or a chair. Tenchi remembered 
what happened when he got home.

**Flashback**

"What happened?" Washu said, her concern barely masked in 
her voice.

"She was hit by a blast from one of Anatio's robots," 
Tenchi said.

"I see."

"Will she be alright?"

"I-I don't know. I honestly don't know." Washu paused for a 
moment. "Tenchi, could you please wait outside?"

"Of course." Tenchi left the lab and went into the living 
room. 

"Tenchi?" Ayeka asked. No reply. She asked again, this time 
a little louder. "Tenchi?"

"Huh? Oh, yes Miss Ayeka?"

"What happened up there?"

"."

"Alright. You don't have to talk about it."

"Thanks, Ayeka."

**End Flashback**

That was a little over an hour ago. Washu hadn't given them 
any word on Ryoko's condition. No one was allowed inside 
the lab, not even Kiyone.

No matter how hard Tenchi tried to stop it, the image of 
Ryoko lying on the ground unconscious with blood pooling 
around her kept replaying itself in Tenchi's mind.

The hit should have been mine.Kami, Ryoko, why did you have 
to take that blast for me?

Cause she's in love with you, stupid!

Oh great, my inner voice is tormenting me.

Hey, I'm just trying to make you realize something that 
should be painfully obvious. Face it, you're head over 
heels in love with her.

WHAT!?

It's true. Don't try to deny it.

I-I-

Before Tenchi could finish his internal argument, Washu 
came out of her lab.

After a few moments of uncomfortable silence, Sasami asked 
the question that was on everyone's mind. "How's Ryoko?"

"I can't say. Her condition is stable, but she's fallen 
into a very deep coma. For some reason, her healing system 
isn't activating. Anything could tip the scale either way." 
Her voice was completely cold, but the others could see by 
looking in her eyes that she was very worried about her 
daughter 

"Can-can I see her?" Tenchi asked.

"Of course. I don't think she'll be able to hear you, 
though."

"Thank you, Washu-chan."

Tenchi walked into the lab. He found Ryoko and sat down in 
a chair next to her bed. 

"Ryoko, can you hear me?" She was silent. Not that Tenchi 
was really expecting an answer. "Ryoko, please don't die on 
me. I."

Say it!

You again?

Yeah, me again. Come on, say it. You know you want to.

Tenchi knew his inner voice was right. "Ryoko, I love you. 
Please," he said, tears starting to form in his eyes, 
"please wake up."

He wasn't aware of the figure watching him from behind.

Oh, Tenchi.

The figure left the lab silently, also with tears forming 
in her eyes.


Author's notes: Hey, Kyinia, that wasn't really that sad. I 
mean, only a complete hopeless romantic would cry over 
this.
Kyinia: Wha-what are you saying?
BWA-HA-HA! YOU!? A HOPELESS ROMANTIC!? I never would've 
guessed!
Kyinia: I may be a hopeless romantic, but I'm a powerful 
hopeless romantic.
Uh oh.(Runs away.)
Kyinia: Turnabout's fair play, Chibi-C. (Manic laughter.)
