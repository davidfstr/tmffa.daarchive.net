Act 1 Scene 5

(this scene starts on the next day in the early hours of the morning. Washu 
is
awake and is busy tapping at her computer near to the container that the 
little
girl is being kept in.)

Washu - Hmmm? Now, where should I start? Oh, that Mihoshi is so hopeless!
Everything is completely mixed up, it will take me at least 3 days to fix my
machine.
Doll A - You can do it Washu!!
Doll B - Washu's the greatest!!

(suddenly, the girl in the container starts to stir and wakes up.)

Doll A - Washu!!! She's awake!!
Washu - Oh (turns around to look at the container) She's awake. Hmmm, she 
looks
alright. No damage done. Yep, she's successfully travelled into this 
dimension
without being injured. The first person to use my machine successfully!!!
(laughs)

(the girl looks around the glass container with a frightened expression on 
her
face.)

Washu - (looks at the girl with a kind expression) Are you alright?
L.Girl - (nods her head) Where am I? What year is it?
Washu - You are in my laboratory and this is the year 2003.
L.Girl - 2003?? How did I end up here?
Washu - Very long story. Do you think you could tell me your name and what 
year
you came from??
L.Girl - (nods) I'm from the year 2010 and my name is Bijoshi.
Washu - Well, Bijoshi, my name Washu and I live here with many others -
Katsuhito, Nobuyuki, Ayeka, Kiyone, Mihoshi, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, Tenchi and 
Ryoko.
Bijoshi - What a big coincidence! My parents are called Tenchi and Ryoko!!!!
Washu - Hmmm, what's your last name?
Bijoshi - Masaki.
