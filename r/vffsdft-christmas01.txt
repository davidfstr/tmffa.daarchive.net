A very face-faulting, sweat-drop filled Tenchi Christmas
Part one

It's a cold, snowy, Christmas day at the Masaki house. Everything is covered with a 
peaceful white powder. The lake, the carrot field, and the trees are white. Tenchi has just 
awoken and is rising from his bed with a yawn. For some reason, Ryoko isn't two inches 
in front of his face. After Tenchi walked out of the bathroom from his morning routine, 
Aeka stepped in front of him.

"Merry Christmas, lord Tenchi!" she handed him a huge box wrapped in red paper with 
trees on it. "It's a present I got specially for you."

"Thank you, Miss Aeka," replied a surprised Tenchi. He opened a box and inside was a.

"HEY! What do you think you're doing?" Ryoko appeared right in front of Aeka. Tenchi 
stood there watching them.

"I was just giving Lord Tenchi a present for Christmas, you. you monster woman!" 
exclaimed Aeka.

"Ha! You couldn't give a good present to a paper bag!"

"Oh yeah?! Did you get Tenchi a present?"

"Yeah! I did! And it's much better than anything you could possibly give!"

Aeka had charged up her logs while Ryoko's energy sword zapped into existence. Tenchi 
stood there trying to get them to calm down. Ryoko headed charged at Aeka full speed 
and swung her energy sword right into Aeka. PING! The sword bounced off as Aeka 
quickly conjured a shield. "HAHAHAHA!" she laughed, "You think your puny sword 
can withstand my."

BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A loud noise made the Masaki household rumble. The three froze 
for a minute. "I'VE DONE IT!" a familiar voice yelled from downstairs. Tenchi, Ryoko, 
and Aeka rushed downstairs.

"What did you do, little Washu?" Mihoshi was downstairs on the couch and Washu was 
standing in front of the door to her laboratory.

"Why, I've invented the automatic gift-wrapping machine!" Washu's puppets popped up 
over her shoulder. "That's right, another successful and useful invention by the best 
scientific genius in the universe!" "Washu, you're so great!"

Sweat drops formed on everyone. "Um. Washu," said Sasami, "it's already Christmas." 
Washu face-faulted.

"WHAAAAAAT!?!?!? It's already Christmas!? Oh well, back to the drawing board." 
Washu opened the door and walked into her lab. Sasami was sitting by the Christmas tree 
reading a book. Mihoshi was fiddling with a rubix cube, and Ryo-ohki was next to an 
extremely large basket of carrots doing. take a wild guess.

"Merry Christmas, Tenchi!" said Sasami and Mihoshi.

"Merry Christmas, Sasami, Mihoshi," Tenchi smiled.

"Hey Tenchi, do you want your Christmas present from me?" Ryoko was in front of him, 
handing a small blue box with stripes.

"Um, sure, Ryoko," said Tenchi. Tenchi opened the box, inside was a.

KABOOOOOM!!!!!!! Yet another loud noise made the house rumble. "Gee, I wonder 
what that could be," Tenchi said sarcastically.

Washu stepped out of her lab, "I'VE DONE IT!" she said. Washu's puppets popped up 
again. "Yes, Washu! You're the best!" "You sure have made the best invention ever!"

"What have you made this time?" asked Mihoshi. 

"A self-spinning dreidel!" she said. Everyone face-faulted. "What?" asked Washu.

"Um. little Washu," said Aeka, "It's past Chanucka."

"Oh. really?" asked Washu. A sweat drop formed over her. "Well, back to the drawing 
board again." She slammed the door behind her and everyone but Sasami and Tenchi 
tried to figure out Mihoshi's rubix cube.

Sasami stepped up to Tenchi and handed him a gift box. It was wrapped in red paper with 
Ryo-ohkis on it. "Here, Tenchi. It's for you."

"Thank you, Sasami." Tenchi said, he smiled back at her. Tenchi opened the box, and 
inside was a.

"NO! THAT IS NOT HOW IT GOES, MISS RYOKO!" Aeka and Ryoko were fighting 
over the rubix cube. Mihoshi crouched on the couch.

"Yes it is, little miss princess!" Ryoko was trying to pull it from Aeka's hands. "See? 
You turn it here, and then here, or was it there?"

"See? I told you that is not the right way!" Aeka had again charged up her logs. Ryoko's 
energy sword phased into her hand.

"WAAAAAAAAAH!" Mihoshi started bawling, while Tenchi and Sasami tried to stop 
them. Ryo-ohki meowed in panic. Yosho had entered the room and stepped in front of the 
fighting pair.

"That's enough, ladies. We should be having a merry Christmas. Oh, yes, merry 
Christmas, everyone."

"Merry Christmas!" everyone said. They all calmed down. Ryoko and Aeka had turned 
on the TV. Mihoshi fiddled with her rubix cube, and Sasami read her book again.

"Ah, Tenchi. I have a Christmas present for you," said Yosho. He handed Tenchi a box 
wrapped in plain gold paper. Tenchi opened the box after thanking him and inside was 
a.

KABLOOOOEY!!!!!!! Another loud noise filled Tenchi's home. Sweat drops formed on 
everyone. "Washu again," muttered Ryoko. The door opened again, but this time Washu 
didn't step out, she ran out. "I'VE DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!" She exclaimed.

Mihoshi, always appreciating Washu, said "What have you done lit." But before she 
could finish a loud robotic voice filled the room. "Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho." A 
gigantic robot looking like Santa Claus stepped into the room. Then some light appeared 
before the robot's eyes. The eyes turned red and looked at Mihoshi's cube. ZAP! It flew 
out of her hands. "WAAAAAAH! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, LITTLE WASHU!?!?"

Everyone ran outside while the giant robotic Santa ran after them. "Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho. 
Ho ho ho." He walked out of the house through a wall, breaking it. "Oh no!" Exclaimed 
Mihoshi. Ryoko was already in action. With sword in hand, she rushed toward the robo-
Santa and sliced it's head clean off. The head fell to the ground with a thump. "Ho ho ho. 
Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho," The metallic voice went on and on, even though its head was 
clearly not connected to its body.

The robo-Santa walked up to it's decapitated head, put it back on, and continued to walk 
towards them. "Ho ho ho. Ho ho ho."
