Mystery in a Dream
Part V of the "Chronicle" Series
By Greg "Puff-Cloud" Kerby

Chapter 1

"According to various reports, they are
headed for the earth at this moment..." explained
Yukinojo.  Various screens flashed in front of
Mihoshi as the sub-ordinate robot gave Mihoshi
all of the details, some of which she had already
known about, including Kagato's possible survival
after the explosion on the Soja so long ago.
"However, we may also have another report of a
escapee from the GP Prison on Gamma Omaan.  The
escapee is now the second most wanted on our
Eternally Wanted List.  His name is Sumakka, the
infamous brother of Kagato.  His crimes include
the assassination of Konachi, the former Head
General of the Jurai defense forces, and member
of the Royal family, 714 years ago.  His relation
to the Royal Family of Jurai was that he was the
current King's brother.  His goal was to obtain
the General's key, the Jurai Katars, confirmed
to be the 2nd Generation Master Key."  Continued
Yukinojo, and shifted to his left to display a mug
of the deceased General.  "Mihoshi!!!  Are you
listening to me?"  Cried the robot.

Mihoshi was staring in the direction of the
Masaki residence.  The expression on her face was
not a happy one.  Yukinojo was beginning to get
concerned.

"Mihoshi, is something wrong... Mihoshi?"
She looked back at Yukinojo, who was staring at
her up close in the face. "Aaaaahhh!!!" she
screamed the young officer.  The robot was motionless.

"How many times must I tell you..." Mihoshi
said as she began to chastise her subordinate,
but not before Yukinojo finished the sentence,
"Don't surprise me like that.

"I know.  But it's the only way I can get
your attention."

"Well sorry!" the blonde said firmly.

"As I was saying..." as Yukinojo was speaking,
a screen appeared in front of him, displaying
an emergency call on the screen. "Mihoshi...
are you there?" sounded the voice of a familiar
green-haired detective.  She recognized the
voice immediately.

"KIYONE!!! It's you!" Mihoshi squealed with
delight as the image of her partner filled
the screen. A drop of sweat appeared on the
side of Kiyone's face.
"YOU IDIOT!!!  NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THAT!
I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO RATHER
THAN SEE YOU DANCE AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!"
her face was beginning to turn blood red as
she began to catch her breath.  Stray hairs
stuck out with vivid detail from her head.

"Sorry.........now what were you gonna say?"
uttered Mihoshi, as she began to pick herself
up off the ground.

"I just received a special alert from HQ.
There is an A1 class criminal on the loose... and
he's on his way to Earth." Kiyone explained, but
was interrupted by Yukinojo,

"Sorry to... well, how do you say it? Burst
your bubble, but I have already received the
breakout report from HQ.  Sumakka is indeed on
his way to earth."

"And not only that, Washu found out something."
Blurted Mihoshi.  "Brace yourself... Kagato may
still be alive." Kiyone face faulted.

"WHAT!?!" the other two said in unison.  "How
is that possible Mihoshi?  You wrote in the report
in the Kagato case that Tenchi destroyed him."  The
two seemed to be confused and angry at the same time.

"It's kinda hard for me to explain, so I
guess Washu will have to explain it to you."
Kiyone calmed down.  At least there was one person
she could count on to explain something correctly.

"I'll send a notice to HQ."  said Kiyone.

"I am already one step ahead of you, officer
Kiyone," said Yukinojo.  "I've already sent
a transmission to the marshal.  Also, I requested
that he talk to Washu personally... if that is all
right with you Mihoshi?"  He said, turning his
head toward to the blonde police officer.

"Umm... sure!  I'm sure she won't mind at all."

Kiyone looked at a watch on her waist.
"Good. I'll be within the teleportation range of
Earth within 15 minutes.  I have already detected
the ship Sumakka is in.  He appears to be within
100,000,000 miles from Pluto.  They will arrive at
Earth most likely within a few weeks at the speed
they are traveling in. Looks like he is preparing
for a long battle ahead of time.  He thinks like
his brother..." Mihoshi looked back at the Masaki
residence once again.

It was pitch black.  And it was cold...  like the
inside of your body was caught off guard by an
unknown source of cold air. Yet, there was no
indication of a single condition possible of making
such a sensation.  No. It was nothing like
that.  It was a sensation of guilt.  And it made
Ayeka shiver unlike anything she had ever felt.  And
yet, it began to make her queasy.  She curled up
into a ball, in an attempt to shake off the chilling
feeling, which proved futile... and it didn't help
ease her nauseating body either. The princess caught
a glimpse of a bright light in her eyes.  And it
was beginning to get bigger and brighter, as if it
were getting closer.

'Ayeka...' called out a voice.  'Ayeka...'
"Who's there?  Hello?"  'Ayeka wake up...' The
blackness of her surroundings turned a blinding
white.

A fuzzy image began to appear before her, slowly
coming into focus.  Sasami looked down upon her
from outside a glass tube.  The young girl smiled
as drop of tears streamed down her face, and landed
on the tube.

"Sasami... where am I?"  Asked Ayeka in a
soft and weak voice.

"Inside Washu's lab.  She saved your life."

"Where are the others?"  Sasami wiped the tears off
her face.  Ayeka noticed Ryo-Ohki on top of her
sister's head.  The little cabbit hopped onto the
tube and phased through it, landing on the
princess' chest.

"You want to keep me company, Ryo-Ohki?"
"Miya." Meowed the creature in agreement, as
Ayeka stroked its head.  The cabbit lay down
comfortably on her chest.

"I'll go get them."  Said Sasami, as she ran
off to find her companions.  Ayeka ran her hand
through her soft, purple hair, as she heaved a
sigh of relief.  There was so much going through
her head.  What was that dream about?  And what was
the strange voice?  It was unlike any she had ever
heard before...

"Ayeka, I'm glad you're awake," spoke the soothing
voice of Tenchi.
"I am too, Lord Tenchi."  The sound of air being
released filled the room.

"Stand back, Tenchi.  I'm going to open the chamber."
Explained Washu.  Her small fingers rapidly pushed
what seemed to be random buttons on a keypad but the
young scientist knew exactly what each one of their
functions.  The princess slowly began to slide out
of the glass tube in which she was confined.

***********************************************************

The household seemed desolate.  The only people
in the house were Ryoko and Sabi.  Sabi's head was
racing with unanswered questions.  'What is going
on here?!?  And who is Kagato?  They all seem as if
he was some kind of foe from a long time ago...
And that young girl, what was her name?  Ayeka???
She seemed interested in my weapons.  Argh!!! This is
so confusing!  I wonder if "she" has some answers.'
Sabi looked around, searching for Ryoko.

"Looking for someone?" sounded a voice from above.
Sabi turned his head in the direction from which
the voice came from.

"Ryoko! How in the hell did you get up
there?!?"  The demon giggled with amusement as
she began to hover down toward him.  "I was
wondering if you could answer a few questions?"
asked Sabi as Ryoko landed gently on the sofa
next to the young man.

"Hm... No..."  were the only words.  Sabi was
astonished.  'Wait second...' he thought with a
devilish grin in his smile.

"Well... I was going to tell you the no. 1 way
that you can get Tenchi in the sack..." came the
only thing she had always hoped someone would tell
Ryoko.  Only she would expect those words from
Washu.  Her eyes lit up with delight as she floated
down onto the seat next to him.  "And only if you
answer a few questions for me." He continued.  "I
might be able to help you all somehow if you get me
up to date with the past and the present."  He didn't
know why the hell he wanted to do this.  It was
just a gut instinct.  Maybe he should ask his
Grandfather Shinqei. After all, he was the one who
gave him the damn Katars.  'He should have something
to do with this,  because if I am the great-grandson
of Konachi, then he is the son!
