Disclaimer: As I always must do, I do not own Tenchi Muyo, Universe, Or
that horrible series Tenchi In Tokyo *3rd time wasn't a charm this time
people, sorry*. If I did, I would be way too rich to care about writing
a fic for you people, but since I'm not rich *as you can tell* I guess I
will write the 3rd chapter of this series *hope it doesn't follow the
trio usually sucks movie style*

Setting:Earth, the year being unknown to the people who inhabit the
area.  The only information that can be given on the year is that it is
some time in BC.  Farming land, the state being unknown since there is
none. A small child is outside while the parents are elsewhere.

                         The New Warrior ep.3

______________________________________________________________________________

        The child gazes across the barren fields, looking for some sort of
activity.  Unknown to the young boy, a once in a life time event is
going to occur.  This boy is not like any other child, because he has a
secret power inside of him that hasn't been revealed to him or any one
else.

        As he is looking around, elsewhere in the orbit above Earth, a small
ship is sending out a scanning wave to inspect the planet for any
rarities.  The ship belonging to space pirates wouldn't be much of a
challenge for any other present-day Jurain ship, but it still has
managed to get quite a haul.  Inside of the radio Op. station, a person
is sitting infront of a green scanning device, receiving information
from the waves the ship sends out.  As of yet, he hasn't seen any sort
of rare item or valuable treasure to steal from the weak planet, but,
even in all of his boredom, he continues his job.  After several more
minutes of scanning, the waves send back a power signal that was sensed
from the planet.  The man switches on the filter so that the power
signal can be scanned effectively.

        After the filter process is done, the man checks the power signal
once
more.  He stares with shock and amazement of the signal that is
emanating from the planet.  The man stands up and runs at full speed off
towards the bridge of the ship.  When he runs through the door, the
bridge's inhabitants turn to him with questioning looks.  The man leans
on the side of the wall for support, breathing heavily.  Finally, he
looks up with a piece of paper in his hand.  The second in command takes
it and scans the paper with his eyes.  When he reaches the number, he
too opens his eyes wide and drops his jaw.  He walks over to the captain
and slowly hands him the paper.  The captain looks at what was shocking
the two men and, like the others, looks with amazement at the number.

        The captain stands up and starts to give commands to the occupants
of
the bridge.  He commands the helm to set course for the location, while
telling the commander of the pirates small military on the ship to get
prepped for a drop.  The Ships engines start up with a jolt as the tiny
ship flies off towards the power source.

        Back on Earth, the small child is looking up at the sky.  He senses
something, not being able to tell what it is, but sensing it all the
same.  He shrugs it off and starts to walk over to his house.  Without
warning, he starts to break into a full run.  A ship drops out of the
sky and hovers above the ground.  Some men and women wielding staves or
energy rifles land around the surrounding area, a few of them holding a
small hand-held scanner to find the energy source.

        One of the pirates finally notice the boy and points his energy
rifle
at him.  The boy is filled with terror as the man starts to pull back on
the trigger.  One of the people holding a scanning device look around,
then start to walk off towards the power source.  The gun wielding
pirate is about to shoot and kill the boy, but the scanner wielding one
walks right into the kid on accident.  The scanner falls over and the
child looks at it, the energy source appearing right where he is.  The
man looks from the scanner to the kid. After realizing what happened, he
whistles for the rest of the group to come over.  They slowly walk over
with expressionless faces and look from the kid to the scanning device.
The largest of the group comes and picks the kid up by one of his
hands.

        Finally, the child's parents appear from outside of the house.  They
look from the pirates to their child to the space ship behind him. The
father starts to run at the child, dawning a cheaply made sword.  One of
the pirates turn to the man running at him, raising his energy rifle.
He pulls back on the trigger and an energy shard flies out of the
barrel.  Before the man can react, the shard tears through his stomach
and stop when it hits his small intestine.  The hole in his stomach
radiates energy slowly.  The man tries to pull it out but the energy
explodes inside of his gut, sending smaller shards ripping through his
body and out of his skin.  He falls over on the ground slowly and
releases his sword.  The child looks in horror but doesn't move.  One of
the other space pirates lift their gun to the child's mother and blast
her away.

        After looking at the surrounding area, the pirates walk off towards
the
ship with the child in one of the man's arms.  They set him into a
hibernation crystal without him making much effort to fight back.  The
ship lifts off of the ground slowly and flies off through the atmosphere
to the pirate's home planet.

Setting: Back inside the unknown golden ship. Commanders chambers.

        He opens one eye first, then the other, trying to remember where he
is.
After he finally remembers his surroundings, he proceeds to roll off of
his bed. Standing up slowly and dawning his golden armor, the all too
familiar commander of the golden ship walks over to a cabinet.  He opens
it up to reveal an immense sized broadsword.  The broadsword is in a
regular leather sheath, radiating some sort of green energy from it.
The hilt itself is marble white, being almost half a foot in length the
bottom of the hilt ends in a sharp Dagger like point with rugged edges
on the side so that it can tear and rips it's unfortunate receivers
flesh from their body.

        He takes the broadsword along with it's sheath and carries it with
him
to the bridge of his ship.  When he gets there he sets the broadsword to
the left of his seat and turns to his left, throwing his red cape over
him and reaching over to a small chamber.  He reaches his hand inside
and takes out two small silver looking hilts and an old fashioned gun
holster.  He places the hilts inside of the holster and puts it around
his waist.  He reaches back inside and takes out his cloak, which
resembles the one Kagato wore.  He tosses it over his head and lets it
fall down along the length of his body.  He grabs his helmet and sits
down in his chair.  The commander places the helmet to his right and
lies back in the chair, starting up the afterburners on the ship.

Setting (once more): Masaki Residence. The girls are inside watching
t.v. while Washu is still in her lab, checking some things over.  She
writes something into her computer and a mechanical looking arm appears
in a hologram above her.  The arm spins in a circle and flexes as Washu
wishes so she can examine it. The arm turns white and creates an energy
ball on its fist.  It flings the beam out through the air right at
Washu, who doesn't move as it flies into her head.  She stands up and
walks off towards the lab exit, getting ready to tell Tenchi & Ryoko
some bad news.  As she exits Sasami comes up to her. “Hello Washu, what
were you in there so long for? You missed a lot of dinners.” “Don't
worry Sasami”, Washu calmed her, “I was just testing some things. Where
is Tenchi?” “I don't know Washu, he should be coming home from school
about now though.” “Ok Sasami, thanks.” Sasami give Washu a cute smile
and walks back into the living room. “Ryoko,” Washu calls, “Ryoko come
here.” Ryoko sighs and phases through a wall. “What is it? I am missing
the best part of the soap opera!” “Ryoko, I need to tell you something
important.” “Ok then, what is it?” “Ryoko..” “Well?? Ryoko what I need
to get back to my show “Ryoko...you have a brother.” Ryoko stares there
blankly, then slowly comprehends what she just said. “WHAT? I don't have
a brother” “Yes you do Ryoko, and he is coming to Earth right now.”

Setting: Atmosphere above Earth. A Jurain Vessel is floating slowly to
Earth and the Masaki residence, housing the Empresses of Jurai.  Masaki,
being happy as usual, is thrilled about seeing her children and is
running all over the ship in anticipation like an idiot.  The ships crew
grows the ever popular huge sweatdrop as Masaki runs all over hugging
everyone with joy as the ship lumbers towards Earth.

Setting:Just behind an asteroid in the asteroid belt dividing the inner
and outer planets.  Another Jurain Vessel, larger than the other is
flying towards Earth. The Emperor of Jurai is sitting in his chair,
thinking about how to confront his daughters.  The idiot Seeyero *I cant
spell his name, sorry* Is in his quarters grooming himself and preparing
to battle the one known as Tenchi so he can ask Ayeka’s hand in
marriage.  The asteroids crash off of the Jurain ship's energy shield as
it flies slowly through the asteroid belt.  Not one person except for
Washu and now Ryoko are knowing the fact that someone unintended is
coming towards Earth to carry out some plot against them. The Commander
of an accompanying ship is trying to pick up a radio signal from Jurai
but having no luck, thinking it's the asteroids and not a jamming
signal, he continues to try to contact them with no luck.  He shrugs it
off and continues his operations.

        The Emperor of Jurai is deep in thought about earlier occurrences,
such
as this person coming out of no where and rising to the ranks of Jurai’s
Royal Guard.  He knows there is not one person on Jurai with the
exception of Tsunami or mabey his daughters that can protect them if he
goes against Jurai. Unknown to him, this has already occurred, the
individual being yes, you guessed it the commander of the golden ship.
King Azusa has a worried look on his face but shakes it off as they
finally get through the asteroid belt and head towards Earth.

Ok, I know this one was kind of long and boring, but I was trying to get
the guy's past into perspective before he comes to Earth, so you know
he's not just coming to kill Ryoko for the hell of it.  Send comments to
Defcon_00@hotmail.com  I don't think I will write another fan-fic until
I get SOME sort of feed back on what should happen with this guy.
Thanks and this is one more fan fic from your *not really* favorite
writer, Defcon. See ya peoples
