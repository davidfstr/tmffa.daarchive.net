She's A Wild One
Chapter 1: Oops, she did it again!
by:  Rebel Princess


 It happened at about midday, Ryoko was coming down the stairs with a
giggling baby Mayuka in her arms. They had just finished their daily baths,
and they were pink and clean smelling. Ever since Mayuka's rebirth, Ryoko
had taken over full responsibility  of taking care of the infant, and she
didn't regret one minute of it. As Ryoko made her way to the bottom of the
stairs Washu suddenly popped up in front of her, almost giving Ryoko a
heart attack, and making Mayuka giggle at her mommy"s expression.
"WASHU!!!  You know not to do that when I'm holding the baby!! " Ryoko
fumed.
"Oops! i'm sorry Little Ryoko,  I didn't see Mayuka there, and is that any
way to talk to your mother?" Washu playfully scolded.
" No MOTHER! WHAT DO YOU WANT NOW?" Ryoko grumbled not trying to hide the
hint of sarcasim in her voice.
"Oh nothing, I just have a teeny weeny lil' experiment that I want to try on
you," Washu said matter of factly
"OH NO! THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL THAT YOU'LL GET ME IN THAT LAB AGAIN, I
STILL HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT LAST
TIME, MOTHER." Ryoko snarled, her voice dripping with venom, and her fangs
showing, before Washu could answer back, Mayuka let them know
that she was hungry by letting out a howl. Ryoko softly jiggled Mayuka while
walking toward the kitchen saying, "Shh, Shh, don't fret Mommy's
gonna get her little angel her bottle, don't worry." Ryoko walked into the
kitchen and started making May's bottle, while singing softly to the infant,
before she started she made sure no one was around so they wouldn't hear
her, especially Ayeka, knowing that the prissy princess would make fun of
her, if she did hear.
Mayuka was smiling softly, she always loved when her mommy sang to her,
because her mommy had a very sweet voice. May thought of Ryoko as
her mother because she was the only one that would stay with her, sure all
the others liked playing with her, but they wouldn't get up in the middle of
the night to feed or change her, or sing to her! Mayuka smiled up at Ryoko
and grabbed a lock of her hair and said, "Mama!" Ryoko smiled at her little
angel, but was stunned, because she always thought that May's first words
would be "Papa" since she was as fond of Tenchi, as she was of her.
Smiling Ryoko fed May and brought her up stairs getting ready to put her
down for her afternoon nap, Mayuka was already dozing when they got in
there.

     A few minutes later, Ryoko was floaing down the stairs when she heard
Washu in her head.
*Ryoko, oh lil Ryoko!"*
*WHAT MOM???*
*Will you please listen to what the experiment is about?*
*NO*
*PLEASE!!!!*
*NO MOM!*
*Oh come on Ryoko! just hear me out!*
Ryoko mentally groaned.
*Fine but make it quick mom*
*YESSS! ok here it is.... I have made a new and improved machine that will
make you remember your childhood...BEFORE KEGATO!*
Ryoko looked stunned.
*R-r-r-eally, you can do that mom?*
Washu smiled smugly.
*of course I can, I do happen to be the world's smartest and cutest genius
in the world!*
*Fine mom, I'll do it.*

***********************************************************

Ryoko trudged slowly toward the door to Washu's lab, dreading every step. *I
can't believe I'm  gonna do this, hmmmm, oops i forgot to write my
will!* Ryoko thought sarcastically. Well here goes nothing*  And with as
much bravery as she could muster, she strode into the lab.

"Oh Ryoko! how good of you to make it ," Washu said as she walked toward her
daughter.
"Mom, can we get this done and over with? I want to get back before May
wakes up from her nap." Ryoko asked as she looked at all the new
inventions.
"Ok, ok hold on" Washu walked over and picked up a strange silver looking
gun with a green liquid in it , (Just think of the thing from MI:2, it looks
like that) as she walked toward Ryoko with it , Ryoko's eyes got huge and
she backed away slowly, Washu kept coming but had a sly grin on her face.
Ryoko backed into a long tube, almost like a freezing tube, but it looked
very different, as she looked around she saw five similar tubes all in a
row.
"Washu stay away!" Ryoko shouted as she pressed a button on the side of it
next to her, a large plate of glass fell down and Ryoko saw Washu grin
fade into a look of horror. That was the last thing that Ryoko saw before
she blacked out.

    Washu watched as her daughter backed inside the tube, and grinned.
"Ok, Ryo-" she never got to finish, as she saw Ryoko press the button her
whole world turned upside down, and a complete look of terror registered on
her face.
"Oh no, my baby!" Washu ran over to the tube and started to pound on the
glass, tears falling from her eyes as she saw her daughter disappear.
*Oh no! Why did she have to go into the dimension destortion? *
"Well looks like we're all going on a trip" Washu said to herself as she ran
out of the lab.
"TENCHI!!! TENCHI WE HAVE A VERY VERY BIG PROBLEM!!!!"
