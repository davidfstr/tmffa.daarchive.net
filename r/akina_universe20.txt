Part 20

	"NOOO!!" Araumi quickly woke up from a nightmare.
"Araumi, are you okay?"  Hiroshi ran into the room.
"I............."  Araumi was trying to calm down.  ".........I need to go back 
to Earth."  
"Uh, okay.  Do you need to call your friend to come pick you up?"  Hiroshi said.
"No it's okay, I'll fly back."  Araumi walked into the bathroom with her 
clothes.  "What's happening on Earth?"  Araumi thought as she changed.  

	Everyone stood in Washu's lab and could only watch as the two Ratixian's 
recovered.
"This is terrible." Sasami rubbed her eyes.
"I don't understand, who could have done this to Yukio?"  Ryoko glared at his 
gaping wound.
"Aaah!"  Mihoshi screamed and became pale.
"What is it?"  Everyone stared at her.
"What if.......what if it was.....that......that........."  She gulped.
"Spit it out already!"  Ryoko growled.
"What if it was the terrible dweller from the Kohana chapter!?!?"  Mihoshi 
panicked.
"The dweller?"  Kiyone thought for a second.  "It couldn't be."
"But Kiyone, remember you said that one day the dweller would return and Kohana 
would be resurrected into a warrior."  Tenchi said.
"Kohana hasn't........."  Kiyone looked over at Akina.  "No....."  She became 
slightly pale.
"Kiyone."  Raikon put his arms around her.
"Listen, Mihoshi may be right, and if she is that may mean that Akina is......."  
Washu started but saw Kioko standing in the doorway.
"Washu......is.........is my Mom..."  Kioko had tears running down her face.
"Kioko, you have to understand that Kohana is........" 
"I DON'T CARE!"  Kioko shouted.  "I don't care about Kohana, she can't take my 
Mom away from us!  I'll kill the dweller myself if I have to, I'll make him pay 
for hurting Dad.......I just......."  Kioko fell to her knees. "I just want Mom 
back......."  Kioko cried.
"Kioko."  Kiyone walked over to her and wrapped her arms around her.
"Everyone, let's leave them alone for awhile."  Ayeka whispered and the group 
walked out of the lab.  As they entered the living room Raikon noticed Juro was 
training above the lake and glowing with a bright aura.  

Araumi walked outside of Hiroshi's apartment building with her case in hand.
"I had a great time, thank you for letting me stay here Hiroshi."  Araumi 
smiled.
"Don't mention it, I had a great time too."  Hiroshi  noticed the sadness that 
Araumi was trying to hide.  "Uh, listen Araumi......"  He put his hand on her 
shoulder.  "You can come back any time you want, you're always welcome."  He 
smiled.
Araumi's eyes widened and she wrapped her arms around his neck.  "Oh Hiroshi."  
She kissed him then stepped back.  "I'll come back."  She flew off into the sky.
Hiroshi's eyes were wide and he stared up at the sky.

Later in the depths of the Pacific Ocean..........
"Damn you Kohana, I should have known that you would create another to fight 
along side with you."  The dark figure growled and raised it's head.  
"Wait.......I sense five of them.............but one has the power of Jurai."  
The figure was outlined with a pale red light.  "I sense Five Juraians as 
well.............AHAHAHAHA!  Not only will I destroy the Ratixians but I will 
finish off the Juraians as well, then the Universe will bow down to my power!"  
It laughed evilly and shot to the surface.   It's figure is finally revealed, it 
appeared to be human however it's eyes were snake like and it's ears were 
pointed.  "Soon the Revolution will begin!"  It shot towards Japan.

Juro was exhausted but continued his training.
"I have to become stronger!"  He kept telling himself that to keep going.
"Juro, that's enough."  Raikon called out.
"Lord Raikon."  Juro looked over at him.  "But, I can't, I'm still not strong 
enough!"
"Juro, what are you comparing yourself to?"  Raikon said.
"Huh..........well......I......."  Juro thought.
"Listen Juro, there is more to life than becoming a powerful warrior, I didn't 
realize  that until I first met Kiyone."  He looked over to the house.  "And, if 
you opened your heart to Kioko........" 
"HUH!?  Hey wait a minute you've got the wrong idea!"  Juro blushed.
"Juro, just think about it.  All  this training that you are going through, are 
you doing this all for her, are you becoming strong enough to protect her?"  
Raikon grinned.
"I....er.....well....that is........"  Juro turned red.
"Listen Juro, you're strong enough for now........However...."  He walked to the 
house.
"If you ever break her heart, you better pray that you're stronger than me."  He 
said and walked inside.
Juro's eyes were wide and he gulped.
 
Back in Washu's lab.
"Err......"  Akina's eye lids squinted tightly.
"Hang on there Akina."  Washu whispered as she put a device into Akina's ear. 
"Kohana, can you hear me?"  Washu said.
"Yes....."  Akina's voice changed.
"Kohana, do you know who attacked Yukio?"  Washu said.
"Yes......it was Tanaka."  
"Tanaka?  Is that the dweller?" Washu's eyes widened.
"He's coming, he'll be here soon."  Akina's fists clenched.
"Are you truly the only one that can defeat him?"  Washu asked.
"No.........."  
"Who else can......"  Washu said.
"One that holds the power of light..........."  Akina gasped for air.
"The power of light?"  Washu thought. "I have one more question, is Akina still 
alive?"  
"She is..........." 
"Kohana, you must leave her body."  Washu said.
"Not yet..."  
"Damnit Kohana listen to me!  Two souls can't live in the same body forever, 
Akina has a daughter and a man she loves dearly, if you try to suppress her in 
that body long enough she will die!"  
"I know.......but she cannot fight Tanaka on her own.........if she does, than 
she will die!"  
"She won't be on her own!  Yukio, Raikon, and........" 
"You don't understand......."  Akina reached her hand up and pulled the device 
out of her ear.   
Washu stepped back as Akina rose from the table.  She sat there for a second and 
then her eyes opened.
"Kohana."  Washu stared in shock.
Akina's eye color had changed to green, Kohana was in control.  "I'm going to 
destroy Tanaka."  Kohana said and walked to the lab door.
"You can't!"  Washu tried to stop her but Kohana expelled her energy and shot 
Washu back.  "Do not interfere."  Kohana opened the lab door.
"Akina!"  Ryoko stared at Akina in shock.
"NO!"  Kioko ran at Akina and tried to hit her.
"Kioko what are you doing!?" Ayeka said.
"Bring her back!  BRING HER BACK NOW!"  Kioko shouted.
"You don't understand either little one."  Kohana forced Kioko away and headed 
for the outside door.
"NOO!"  Kiyone grabbed her from behind and trapped her in a head lock.  "Bring 
Akina back now!"  Kiyone demanded but Kohana struck her into a wall.
"Kiyone!"  Raikon looked over at her then glared at Kohana with hatred.
"I will destroy Tanaka, don't interfere."  She growled and flew outside.
"Azaka, Kamidake!"  Ayeka shouted.
"Yes, Ma'am."  They appeared.
"Bring Mrs. Akina's body back!  Quickly!"  She ordered.
"Yes, Ma'am!"  Azaka and Kamidake appeared outside and flew after Kohana.
"Kiyone."  Raikon helped her up.
"Akina........we have to......" Kiyone passed out.
Just then there was a large explosion outside and Azaka and Kamidake crashed 
into the ground.
"Noo!"  Ayeka ran out to them
"MOM!"  Kioko flew after her but Juro stopped her.
"No!  Juro let me go I have to save my Mom!"  Kioko struggled.
"Kioko!  There's nothing you can do."  Juro said.
"NO!  I can't let her go!  MOTHER!"
