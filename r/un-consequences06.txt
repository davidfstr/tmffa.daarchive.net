nerves 
Tuesday 
Nobuyuki opens the door to his Van to let Mihoshi in. They had agreed 
to stay at his apartment after dinner Monday.  
Though they weren't going to see the rest of the family till Friday 
night, both agreed to try this arrangement to see if they  
could make it work together. Mihoshi had positioned a cloaked Yukinojo 
above the apartment building that he lived in. she  
wanted it to be nearby when she had emergencies, and on her biweekly 
planetary patrol. 
He had invited her to go with him to work and they left early to have 
some breakfast at a cafe across from where he  
worked. They had both slept well the last two days. So much so that it 
was one of the reasons Mihoshi had gone to  
Nobuyuki's apartment. 
As they sat and talked about what they were going to do that day, A 
call came into Nobuyuki's phone. 
"Hello?" Said Nobuyuki. 
"Father, its Tenchi, How are you and Mihoshi doing?" He was calling 
from the house. 
"We're doing fine son, how is everyone? I hope nothing has been blown 
up, Right?" 
"Well Ayeka and Ryoko had a heated discussion going about which soap to 
watch after lunch. Then I pointed out to them  
that since we're all training, I'd tape both Shows on the dual VCR tape 
recorder. That was the only real disturbance here  
Dad." said Tenchi. 
"What about that call to Jurai Ayeka was going to make. Did they 
reply?" 
Well, it seems that they were already on their way, so we decided to 
wait till Saturday to tell them then. 
Don't worry Tenchi, we'll all be there for you son, remember that! Said 
Nobuyuki. 
"Thanks Dad, that will help!" said Tenchi. 
"Hmm, How about your Grandpa and Washu? How are they doing?" Asked 
Nobuyuki. 
"They seem to keep to themselves at the shrine. Ryoko has been keeping 
an eye on Washu, and she hasn't told me anything  
big yet. But, She did say that she keeps feeling a new emotion from her 
mother." 
"And what would that be?" asked Nobuyuki 
"She said Contentment, and ... joy!" Tenchi replied. 
"I'm sure it's making your grandfather more joyful too." (Then after a 
pause) "So how are you three doing?" (Referring to  
Ryoko, Ayeka and Tenchi's budding romance) 
"Well I seem to have gotten a truce between them since the their soap 
opera argument and they seem to enjoy our sparring  
with Grandpa." replied a more upbeat Tenchi. 
"Really, what did they enjoy the most son?" 
"The fact that they have some advantages over me with their skills, and 
powers while training. But Dad I surprised them  
today when in the middle of them using their powers against me and 
Grandpa, I called on and got the Light Hawk Wings  
which of course frightened them to death since two of the three wings 
were pointed to their necks." 
"How can that happen?" Mihoshi caught the concern in Nobuyuki's eyes, 
grabbed his arm and asked what was going on? 
"After everyone calmed down Washu, who ran after she heard the girls 
cry out, asked me how I felt when the wings  
appeared and I answered confidant. You know kind of like I knew what 
they were going to do, and that in the back of my  
mind, I could call on the wings." 
"Go on son!" Nobuyuki said 
"She then explained that since the pressure of choosing one of the 
girls was now gone, so my mind could focus more on my  
environment as well as what ever pressure was relieved obviously 
allowed my confidence level to rise as well as my senses." 
"Well it seems that Saturday wasn't the only surprise for us." 
Mihoshi then grabbed the phone and said; "Tenchi what happened is 
anyone hurt?" 
"No, Mihoshi it's just that I can control The Light Hawk Wings now, so 
don't worry OK?" Replied Tenchi. 
"Oh, Ok, I'll give you back your father now, Byyyeeee!" answered 
Mihoshi. 
"Son, we got to go, or I'll be late for work. Remember to tell Sasami 
We'll be back Friday, OK?" 
"Yes Dad, you two keep out of trouble and I'll have Sasami make your 
favorites, OK?" 
"Ok, son. Give my love to all of my family and take care! 
Ok, Dad same to you and Mihoshi! We'll see you Friday! 
"Bye!" 
"Bye Son!"

Wednesday 
To say that everything was normal is to say that a Gundum hasn't a wing 
to fly on! 
Washu couldn't figure it out. And to admit that contradicted her self 
appointed role as Greatest Scientific Genius in the  
Universe! But, that was the truth. It had been four days since her 
punishment began and though she agreed that she should  
do her time, it was still a confusing situation. First she was spending 
most of her time around the man she now knew she  
loved, Prince Yousho Jurai, better known as Katsuhito Masaki, Shinto 
Priest and Shrine keeper. So she was happy. But, at  
the same time, she was miserable. Not being able to run her 
experiments. Doing everything by hand and not only trudging  
up those blasted shrine steps, but also having to sweep them every day. 
She wondered how Tenchi did it for all those years. 
She wanted her old job back! But, she also knew that if she could stick 
it out, she not only got her lab back on Saturday, but  
she would find out if she was a mother again. The wiley scientist and 
lover of Yousho deafly held in this roller coaster of  
emotions. 
Next she remembered that Yousho's, Ayeka's, and Sasami's parents were 
scheduled to arrive that Saturday afternoon. She  
remembered the conversation she had with Funaho so long ago. "Maybe 
they'll try to change my mind ... now that they'll be  
family?" She wondered to herself. 
"I won't let them!" answered the old priest who now stood next to the 
adult Washu. 
"Did I say that out load?" She wondered again. 
"Yes, you did my little Washu!" He then wrapped an arm around her, 
changing to his true younger form. He kissed her on  
her now rosy red cheek. They exchanged some laughter and then headed to 
the shrine office to share some bento boxed  
lunches courtesy of Sasami. 
After a hearty lunch, they both returned to their roles. Washu cleaning 
the courtyard of the Shrine, Yousho was meeting  
Tenchi for afternoon practice. For the second day in a row Tenchi was 
able to bring forth and control the Light Hawk  
Wings. Yousho allowed Washu to stop her sweeping to take notes as he 
and Tenchi used their Jurai power to spar with the  
Tenchi-ken and Light Hawk Wings. Ayeka and Ryoko then joined Washu. 
Since Tenchi was now finished with high school,  
he was at home everyday. Until he decides whether to stay on earth and 
go to College, or being forced to go to Jurai and  
start his training with The Royal guard, and the Jurai Academy to 
prepare for the day he was to be Emperor. What he was  
afraid of the most was the fact that he might have already made that 
decision by his marrying both Ryoko and Ayeka. This  
indecision gave Yousho the opening to strike at Tenchi during their 
training session. "Ouch, That hurt Grandpa!" Said a  
smarting Tenchi, rubbing his head. The light hawk wings flickered off. 
"All right, that's enough for today." Then Yousho put his hand on 
Tenchi's arm and said, "What ever distracted you Tenchi,  
you need to deal with." 
"It will have to wait till Saturday." Yousho chuckled, but was cut 
short by Tenchi. "It's not the chance at being a father,"  
(He looked at both his fianc‚s with love in his eyes) "it's what great-
grandfather will force me to do!" 
A Blue aura flickered around Tenchi for a few moments until Yousho 
shouted: "Tenchi, focus on what you are doing. If  
you don't you might hurt someone you care for!" Tenchi came out of his 
dazed anger long enough to see the aura of power  
around him. He calmed down, and the aura disappeared. 
"Thanks Grandpa, I'll concentrate more. I promise!" With a nod, Yousho 
released Tenchi to his two wives-to-be and the  
three started down the shrine steps. Washu came up next to his love and 
commented; "We'll need to keep and eye on  
him...and help him harness his powers..." 
"Before he hurts himself, or someone else!" finished Yousho, who then 
took Washu's hand and started walking to the shrine. 
As they walked passed the shrine office Washu turned to the shrine 
keeper, and squeezed his hand. "Where are we going,  
may I ask?" 
"We are going to a spot I have found calms the mind, and the soul!" 
replied Yousho. 
After about 15 minutes of walking they came upon a clearing to the 
right side of the path they were on. Yousho guided  
Washu to a stump that had a spectacular overview of the Valley. There 
you could see the shrine, now on the opposite side of  
the valley. Below was a view of the Masaki home, the lake, and the  
dock jutting out in an angle from the house. He then  
motioned for Washu to scoot over a little and he sat down and put his 
arm around her. They then just sat in silence there for  
a few minutes just admiring the view. 
Then he got up, turned around and reaching for something in his pocket. 
Washu was at first confused, then he kneeled down  
on one knee! For probably the second time in her long life, Washu was 
frozen, speechless, as Yousho then spoke. "In these  
past few years you, and the other girls have come and enlightened my 
and my families lives, I never regretted you or they  
being here. As time went by, we grew closer. First as friends, then as 
lovers." They smiled at each other. 
"I have never regretted anything I have done in my life, with only two 
exceptions. His head bowed down at saying this.  
"First it would be hurting Ayeka, in leaving her behind, and tricking 
her and hiding my true identity from her. Washu took  
her hand and rubbed his cheek, signifying her understanding. "But I do 
not regret that she then fell in love with my  
grandson. They and Ryoko belong together." My second regret was, that I 
was such a fool to not see the need you had for  
love... for my love. So you tried to do what you thought could work. It 
backfired and affected all of us. I now will take my  
responsibility for that by saying I love you, Washu Habuki. You are my 
polar opposite who can be annoying at one time,  
and my most trusted friend another. You have awakened the feelings of 
love, and warmth. Something I had lost when Isuki  
died so long ago. I have found that love in you." He looked her in the 
eye. Then he pulled out a gold ring, with a large red  
Ruby, as it's stone. "Will you marry me?" was what he said. 
She was stunned. For only the second time, someone had proposed to her. 
She went back in her mind as Yousho's face was  
superimposed by her former husband. Anguish welled up in her, then his 
image vanished replaced again by Yousho' smiling  
and now also anguished face! 
"YES!! OF COURSE YES! You think I'm foolish enough to pass up the 
opportunity to not marry my soul mate!" she said  
as she leaped on to him and both found the ground. 
After a few minutes of kissing and hugging each other Yousho said; 
"Isn't this what got us into trouble in the first place?" 
"Yeah, and it won't be the last time we do this, Got it Yo-chan!" was 
Washu's reply. Later they made their way down to the  
house to announce their engagement. 
_______________________________________________________________________
________________________________ 
As another eventful dinner finished all were happy at Washu's and 
Yousho's engagement. No one more so than Tenchi,  
Ryoko, and Ayeka. Everyone then went to the living room for a night of 
Kareoke, and Sake'. 
Afterwards everyone got to bed and had a fitful sleep, except one. 
Ayeka was having a nightmare like none she had before.  
In it she was fighting ...Ryoko! Why was she fighting her best friend? 
Then the unthinkable happened, she struck Ryoko's  
abdomen and with Jurai power drove her fist through it. Then as she 
withdrew her hand from her dying friends' body, a  
light hawk sword struck her, while she ran her other hand through... 
Tenchi's upper right chest! As all three lay dying next  
to each other a blond headed figure the size of a 12-year-old stood 
above them with a smirk. "It didn't take much to  
manipulate you did it Princess!" 
Ayeka with her dying breath asked; "Who are you? Why did ....you.make 
me ... kill my ... loves?" 
"My Name is Lord Garyu, I am from another dimension, and I am having my 
revenge on you! 
"But, what have ... we done ... to cause you to ... make me do ... such 
horrible things? Ayeka gasped. 
"Because in my dimension, I lost you to him!" (Pointing to a still and 
bloody Tenchi) "So if I can't have you, nobody will.  
Especially those two!" 
Then he started to laugh a maniacal laugh, as she let out a final 
scream! 
"Ayeka, Ayeka, wake up!" 
Ayeka Slowly regained her bearings as she looked at the two concerned 
faces in front of her clearing field of vision. Then  
she latched on to Tenchi and Ryoko with all her might and started to 
cry uncontrollably. 
After a few minutes and a bit of light headedness from Ryoko and 
Tenchi, Ayeka then did something unexpected. She tore  
open Ryoko's nightshirt and put her hands on the ex-pirates belly. Then 
she did the same to Tenchi only feeling his upper  
right chest to make sure they were not wounded. She then calmed down 
some more when Ryoko offered to go get some  
water for her. She then grabbed her and again started to cry again. 
Both Ryoko and Tenchi shook their heads at each other  
dumbfounded as to what to do. After a few more minutes Ayeka calmed 
down enough to tell them what her dream was  
about. 
After digesting the information, Tenchi motioned Ryoko to get Ayeka 
back to bed, with her sleeping between them. After a  
promise that Washu would scan her, the next day, she agreed to sleep 
again. Ayeka hugged Ryoko like a teddy bear, while  
Tenchi had her in his arms trying his best to comfort the distraught 
Princess. 
After Ayeka finally fell into a more restful sleep, Ryoko and Tenchi 
slipped out and down to the living room. 
After getting some hot tea, both made themselves comfortable on the 
couch as they discussed Ayeka's dream. 
Finally Ryoko spoke. "I'm worried Tenchi, I have never seen Ayeka like 
this. I makes me scared she might ...be..." 
"Losing it! No, It seems that whomever this Lord Garyu is, can already 
affect Ayeka's mind." He took a sip of tea and  
continued. "I'm cutting Washu's punishment short. I need her in her lab 
to find out  how he's getting into Ayeka's mind and  
to stop him." He was glowing a blue aura again. Ryoko slowly tried to 
touch him on his arm and was shocked. Tenchi  
realizing too late dissipated the aura. "I'm sorry Ryo-chan, I 
wasn't..." 
"Paying attention! I know Tenchi dear. Just remember to work with 
Yousho on controlling that aura. All right?" replied  
Ryoko who was helped back to the couch from the wall she impacted on. 
"Tenchi please she's my friend... my best friend. I don't want her to 
go through what I had to go through. Killing people  
without me controlling myself. I can't let her go through that, it will 
break her spirit, Tenchi, please!" said a now pleading  
Ryoko. 
I know that Ryoko, and I'm sure Washu knows too. Remember she saw what 
you saw. We'll do everything we can so this  
Garyu doesn't do any more damage to Ayeka, or to us. Or he'll regret he 
ever knew Tenchi Masaki! 
Well folks, it seems another madman has Tenchi and the gang in his 
sights. Will he succeed, and what about Saturday's  
events. Will they be affected as well? We'll see in Chapter 7: Of 
Love...and Death!
