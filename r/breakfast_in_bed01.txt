      BREAKFAST IN BED

Chapter 1


Hi here is my first fanfick enjoy

All of the fan fiction I have read misses the obvious truth,
Five beautiful powerful women do not chase one man
With out a reason.
Unless the universe has something in mind.
All five ladies end up with tenchi, and their children, are the next
Many levels of evolution.  
Now tenchi and his ladies will live for many thousand years, and
Tenchi will head the jurai empire, when it is necessary.
The best leaders are the ones who do not want the job, because they know
The amount of work involved.

It seams that earth will play an important supporting roll in the future 
evolution 
Of the universe.
Tenchi is 1/8 jurai and 7/8 human, and he is the most powerful of the jurai 
royalty ever.

So human DNA makes other races DNA evolves to the next level.  Tenchi's mother 
was very strong
 and she was 1/4 jurai and 3/4  human.

I see tenchi's children, going a few levels above him, but his children's 
children, becoming gods.

The solid moral and ethical base that tenchi provides will set the new gods on a 
good footing.
Towards the future.

So how does the process start? Simple breakfast in bed.

_________________________________________________________________________

The time is early morning, tenchi is up at the shrine cleaning up and readying 
the temple
For the up coming girls festival.

We get to listen in on tenchi's  thoughts. This festival is a great opportunity 
for me, but 
How can I tell the ladies in my life, that they all mean the world to me, 
without upsetting, one of them or
All of them.  Because I do care, so much for them.

I can't do flowers and candy that is to romantic, I can't take them all out to 
dinner, that would
Attract attention, and not be private enough.  I am not showing them my undying 
love,
Like in the movies.  I just want them to know, that they are closer to me than a 
friend, and mean
More to me then family.
I could cook dinner, but my cooking talent pails compared to Sasami's, and I can 
only cook
Simple things. Now breakfast is a simple meal, and I can make eggs, bacon, 
pancakes
Rice, fish, OJ, tea and milk.
But having everyone just eat it in the kitchen, is not enough, and does not have 
the personal
Touch to make it special.
I want this meal, to show to these five ladies how much I honor and respect 
them.
Come on tenchi, you have a brain use it!.

Of course breakfast in bed, and I can serve each one individually, one at a 
time, and make each
Breakfast different. I am going to have to invite Mihoshi over for the night and 
she can sleep in the living room, and Ryoko will have
to sleep in my bed, for the night since she does not have a room of her own.
I will  sleep on the deck, for the night in my sleeping bag.
Now which of the ladies do I serve first, this could cause a big problem, do I 
go by age,
In alphabetical order, in the order I met them.    

I know I will have the ladies pick numbers out of a bowl, and then no one will 
feel slighted,
And thoughts of favoritism will not be created. Boy I dodged that problem before 
it
Was created.

What else am I going to need?
First I'm going to need my dads, help on some of this, I will need five bed 
trays, nothing to
Fancy. Dad could pick them up after leaving work, He always want to help in my 
development,
As he calls it.  Well this is his chance.

This will work, if I keep it simple and try to think of problems and their 
solutions before they
Happen.  And I hope everyone will be happy.

When I go down for breakfast this morning, I will make a call to Mihoshi in 
Tokyo, and see if 
She can make it in tonight, through washu's dimensional doorway. If she can, I 
will tell everyone
 About my idea at breakfast.

Now a happy tenchi, attacks the job of cleaning the shrine with happy heart, and 
cannot wait
To call Mihoshi.

Tenchi has finished his work early, so that he can go back and call Mihoshi, 
before she leaves for work.

A happy but nervous tenchi is at the phone waiting for Mihoshi to pick up the 
phone.
Then tenchi hears a Hello from Kiyone, and tenchi says " this is tenchi, can I 
speak to Mihoshi?"
"Is anything-wrong tenchi?" Says Kiyone "you never call this early in the 
morning".
'No, nothing wrong. I just need to talk to Mihoshi for a couple of minutes" says 
tenchi.

"I'll get sleeping beauty; in just a second" says Kiyone.  A waiting tenchi 
hears over the phone.
"WHAT", and a scrambling sound followed by a crash.  Then the happy sound of 
Mihoshi
Saying "Yes tenchi what can I do for you?"

A nervous tenchi says quickly "I was wondering if you could come over to my 
house tonight.
And spend the night" but at that point Mihoshi interrupts tenchi and says 
"EEEEEE".
Then a panicking tenchi says "No that is not what I Meant! Tomorrow is Saturday 
and
The start of the girl's festivals, I want to honor the ladies in my life with 
breakfast
In bed for each of you. And you have to sleep over tonight so that I can serve 
you
And do honor to you tomorrow morning ok!"

A stunned Mihoshi blinks here eyes a couple of times, and says in a cheerful 
voice "ok".
" Great " says tenchi  "I will see you later tonight Mihoshi, goodbye".  
"Goodbye"
Says Mihoshi. And tenchi hangs up the phone and breathes a big sigh of relief. 

"Now to go talk to dad, and ask for his help in this plan". Thinks tenchi.
As tenchi turns around he sees his father, standing in the doorway, with a big
Smile on his face. "Oh son what a wonderful Idea you have, what can I do to 
Help?" Says Nobuyuki.  

"This is getting to easy to do", tenchi thinks to himself. "Well I will need 
five breakfast
In bed trays, and maybe some special food, you could pick up before coming home
>From work?'  Say's tenchi. "Oh son I am so happy to help," says Nobuyuki. "It's 
wonderful
Too watch you grow up and make the right decisions" "you make me very proud of 
you tenchi"
say's Nobuyuki.  He then gives tenchi a hug, and tenchi say's "A thanks dad, I 
think
I will go upstairs and clean myself up before breakfast"

"You go right ahead son, I'm looking forward to this breakfast" says Nobuyuki.
A happy but perplexed tenchi goes up to take his morning bath, and thinks to 
He  "how am I going to express my Idea without blushing and looking?
Like a fool? I want this to be perfect".

Tenchi's  first stop is to his bedroom to grab his cloths to work in the garden.
"Today I will change into my work cloths in the bathroom" thinks tenchi
"It will save time and keep others from bargaining in on me as they do in my 
bedroom"

"Now for a good hot both, it should relax me" says tenchi. Now while tenchi sits 
in the tub
He thinks " what am I going to say to the ladies during breakfast".  "I could 
give an along speech about what I want to do and why". 

"But I have never talked that way to the girls or anyone else". "So that Idea is 
no good".

Then tenchi thinks "in school they taught, the best way to talk to people is to 
keep it short,
and simple".  "So if I said breakfast in bed tomorrow, what do you want?"

"No that won't work either, but it is close". "I just need to add a little of 
why I'm doing it, and
how I am going to do it". "yes that's it!" say tenchi to himself as the Ideas 
and words come together
in his head.

Downstairs Sasami has been cooking breakfast and filling the house with the 
wonderful smells of
Her food.  Ayeka and Washu have awakened by alarm clocks and have been getting 
ready for breakfast.
However for Ryoko it's, the smell of food that wakes her.  As she would say the 
only good thing about morning is breakfast.

The sound of the house wakening up lets tenchi know it's almost time to go down 
stairs.
Then tenchi thinks to himself "I will wait until Sasami calls me down for 
breakfast, that way everyone will
Already be there.

As Ayeka goes down the stairs to have breakfast she notices, Nobuyuki  sitting 
at the table with it
Already set, and a big smile on his face. Which causes her to comment. "Good 
morning  Nobuyuki,
You seem to have been busy this morning, and happier than normal". Nobuyuki 
replies with a larger
Smile "Good morning Ayeka and yes I am happier, one of my longer projects just 
took a big step,
Forward towards completion".

At that point Yosho enters the living room and says " good morning Ayeka good 
morning Nobuyuki".
Both return the greeting by saying "good morning ".  Now Sasami steps into the 
room and says " the
Food is done! Ayeka would you bring in the food?. While I get the rest of our 
group to come and eat it".
Then Sasami looks up and says "Ryoko are you ready for breakfast?"  Ryoko says 
"I'm already their kid".
As Ryoko teleports to a seat at the table.

Next Sasami opens the door to Washu's lab and yells down "Washu breakfast is 
ready"
To which washu replies " I will be there in 5.24 seconds".

Finally Sasami yells up the stair to tenchi in a happy high voice. "Tenchi 
breakfast is ready, don't let
It gets cold". Tenchi's muffled reply is "I'll be right there".


Now a nervous tenchi leaves the bathroom, trying not to look nervous and hoping 
that he does not
Trip down the stairs. He sees everyone is at the table waiting for him. Ryoko 
say's " tenchi I saved a spot
Right next to me". Tenchi groans, but then Ayeka says, "Yes and I have saved you 
a place to eat lord tenchi""

Of course the special seat is between the 2 girls Ryoko and Ayeka.  As tenchi 
sits down to eat a puzzled Washu says " Tenchi what's wrong you seem too nervous 
this morning".  This causes all the others to look more closely at Tenchi.  
Which causes tenchi to feel like a bug under a magnifying glass. As tenchi
Blushes, the group looks even closer at Tenchi. Except Nobuyuki who just smiles.

"Thank you for that observation Washu" says tenchi a little annoyed but with a 
smile, because it gives tenchi.
The perfect opportunity to say what he wants to say. So as tenchi stands up six 
puzzled faces look his way.
A nervous tenchi clears his through and says " As most of you know tomorrow 
starts the girls festival
And I want to show the ladies in my life the honor and respect I have for them. 
So I want to serve all five
Ladies breakfast in bed tomorrow morning, In your own beds. So what do you each 
want on your pancakes?"

Four stunned females look at tenchi with their mouths open. While a smiling 
Yosho, and Nobuyuki look at
 The mass confusion. 

Ayeka is the first to ask " Lord Tenchi why are you doing this?" In a loving 
voice. Tenchi replies, "Because you ladies are more then friends to me and 
closer then family to me. I have to do it".

At that moment a stunned Ryoko grabs tenchi around the waist and buries her face 
in Tenchi's side, while
 saying loudly in a broken voice "Oh tenchi that is the most wonderful thing you 
have ever said to me".

The other ladies are taken a back a little, but not much because Ryoko just 
expressed what they felt.

But Washu is shocked more than the others, because she is looking at the 
consequences. In the
Future that this breakfast in bed might cause. And she finds herself smiling at 
all of them. This causes
Washu to look at herself and tenchi more closely, much more closely.

Now Sasami looks lovingly towards tenchi and sighs and says to herself "he has 
noticed me ".
Then Sasami thinks" who is the fifth girl? Hum, hum, hum, I bet its Mihoshi", 
which causes sasami
To say "Tenchi is the fifth girl Mihoshi?"

"Your right sasami " says tenchi. "But where will she sleep?" Asks Sasami. "She 
is going to sleep
On the futon in the living room" says tenchi. " Oh " says sasami.  

"So where will I sleep? " says Ryoko. "In my bed" says tenchi. "Yes!" Says Ryoko 
as she jumps up into Tenchi's arms.  "What!" Say Ayeka, Sasami, and Washu at the 
same time.  "It's not what you think "
Says an embarrassed and frighten tenchi.

"I'm going to sleep on the deck in my sleeping bag tonight" says tenchi. "Oh 
that's no fun, " says Ryoko.
"It may not be the fun thing to do, but it is the right thing to do". Yosho 
stands up and says proudly "tenchi
Your idea is wonderful and what you just said to these ladies is great. You 
really are growing up, you have
Made me proud of you". Then nobuyuki says proudly "I to am proud of you son".
"Thank you dad and grandpa", says tenchi a little embarrassed.

"Lets eat," says Nobuyuki " being happy makes me hungry".  As tenchi sits down 
to eat Ryoko and Ayeka sit a little closer to tenchi. Moreover Ayeka and Ryoko 
don't mind each other's presence around tenchi 
this morning.

While eating breakfast tenchi says "you ladies still have not answered the 
question, what items do you 
Want on your pancakes?".

"I want chocolate, " says Sasami, "I like strawberries" says Ayeka, "I want mine 
plane," says Ryoko,
"I'll take raspberry, " says Washu.

"Did you get that dad", says tenchi. "Yes son, strawberries, chocolate chips and 
raspberries " says
Nobuyuki. "Oh and dad some fresh oranges for orange juice and does anyone want 
grapefruit for breakfast?'
Says tenchi. "Sounds good to me, " says Washu.  'I'll pickup everything plus 
some small honey and maple
Syrup containers after work". Says Nobuyuki.

Breakfast is finished quickly with a smaller, then normal amount of small talk, 
among the group.
After breakfast Nobuyuki goes to work and Yosho and tenchi leave together. While 
4 happy ladies
Wave and yell goodbye.  

As the two men walk away from the house tenchi says "Grandpa, I need five prayer 
strips and some
Ink and a brush". "Ah I see, " says Yosho. "At the start of the ceremony I plan 
to hang prayers on the tree at the shrine for each of the ladies" says tenchi.

Then Yosho says, " tenchi if you keep growing up like this; you are going to 
become impressive".
" But you're going to have to be if your plan works". "There is no plan 
grandfather.  This is something
I have to do," says tenchi. 

"Yes I see how your heart leads you, but can a heart make a tough decision?" 
Says Yosho. "An 
Honest heart will make the right decision " says tenchi with some emotion.
"I hope you are that wise," says Yosho.

The two part, and go to do the work of the day ahead of them.

Jump forward in time, it is after dinner and Mihoshi has already come over for 
the night.  Washu is
Even out of her lab to enjoy the night. Tenchi is in his dad's room, working at 
the drafting table on
The prayer strips. 

As tenchi works he looks at the bed trays and smiles and thinks. " Dad choose 
well, the light oak wood
With a white laminated top. Looks great and the added touch, of each of the 
girls names on the trays,
Was a wonderful idea, thanks dad". 

"Well it's time to go out and find out whom number one is? Thinks tenchi. As 
tenchi leaves his dads room he 
Takes with himself a bowl with 4 strips of paper on it. With the numbers 1 thru 
4 on them.
Now as tenchi enters the living room, he pauses with a smile on his face, as he 
looks over the wonderful
 sight.  The first person to see tenchi  standing in the corner is Ryoko. Then 
Ryoko yells a little loudly and
Happily "tenchi" and then teleports to his side. Then she puts her arm around 
Tenchi's side and says," What
have you got in the bowl tenchi?"

The rest of the people are now looking towards tenchi and the noise of the room 
drops by half.
"I have something important for all you ladies, in this bowl". Says tenchi. As 
he walks into the living 
room with Ryoko at his side.  All eyes are on the bowl now as tenchi speaks, 
"What I have in the bowl, is
4 strips of paper. With the numbers one, thru four on them." "This will be the 
order in which, I will serve breakfast tomorrow morning".

"Since Ayeka and Sasami sleep together, I will serve them together". "And since 
Ayeka and Sasami are
Together, they will pick first!". "So who will choose first, Ayeka or Sasami ?" 
says tenchi.
"You choose the number, I know you will pick a good one", says Ayeka.

A smiling giggling Sasami walks over to tenchi, and looks up with loving eyes, 
as she reaches out to the
Bowl of folded papers. She grabs the first one that touches her fingers.  When 
Sasami reads the number, on
The paper she smiles, and shows it to Ayeka.   

Ayeka says with a smile "yes two is a good number, just like the two of us".

Then Ryoko says, " my turn, my turn" as she reaches for the bowl.  Now Ryoko 
stirs the strips of paper,
Trying for the best one. Then Ryoko says  triumphaly" I got one" as she pulls 
the paper out of the bowl,
And then she reads it " a four " says Ryoko disappointedly 

"Whose next" says tenchi? Then washu says "you go Mihoshi". "Thanks" says 
Mihoshi. The beautiful blond
Mihoshi, is smiling as she walks over the tenchi. With out tripping, and pulls 
out the first paper, that touches
Her hand. Then she unfolds the paper, and reads the number out loud, a little 
too loud.  "Three" says
Mihoshi proudly.

"Well that makes Washu number one" says Tenchi. A little puppet says "There was 
never any dought",
another little puppet says "Washu' s number one".  "Well actually " says Washu; 
"I would like to be last,
If that is ok with you Ryoko?". "Yes "says Ryoko happily, then Ryoko says " 
thanks mom".

"I'm number one " says Ryoko. 

'Since you are the first Ryoko, when would you like to have breakfast in bed 
tomorrow?" Says tenchi.
"Oh um about 7 O'clock" says Ryoko.  "As you wish lady Ryoko" says tenchi. "I 
like the sound of that"
says Ryoko. 

Ayeka reacting to Ryoko's statement gives a little indignant "Hump", while 
lifting her head slightly.
Then tenchi says "at 7:30 I will serve Ayeka and Sasami .  At 8:00 I will serve 
Mihoshi and at 8:30 
Washu" says tenchi.  "Great I get to sleep late", says Washu.

As tenchi asks "Washu how will I find your bedroom, in the lab?" "No problem 
Tenchi, I'll just set
The door to my lab, to open to my bedroom after 8:29 am." Says Washu.

"Now that tomorrow is taken care of, I have to go back and finish a few more 
things. Good night
everyone." Says Tenchi.  A happy group of people wish Tenchi a goodnight, as he 
leaves the living room.
Heading back to his dad's room to finish, the work on the prayer strips.

Back in the living room after a little while, Yosho quietly walks up to Washu, 
and says. "You did not
Want to just to sleep late did you"  "Now is that a question or a statement 
Yosho", says Washu.
"Your call says " says Yosho.  After a pause washu says "I want to ask Tenchi a 
few questions tomorrow".
"Good" says Yosho quietly and walks away. Leaving a thoughtful washu looking 
into her drink.

Little over an hour later Nobuyuki goes to his bedroom, to see how tenchi is 
coming along. As
Nobuyuki  steps into his room, he see's tenchi sitting at the drafting table. 
Nobuyuki says "how goes
The work son?".

"Perfect" says tenchi, "I'm almost done, and I need to get to bed early. Because 
I plan to take the papers
up to the shrine at sunrise". "Oh ! And do you mind if I store the papers in 
your room for the night?"
"Ryoko is sleeping in my room tonight".  "I'm happy to help tenchi", says 
nobuyuki.

Nobuyuki sits down on his bed, and watches tenchi as he finishes the prayer 
strips. 
Tenchi then places the papers in his school bag for safekeeping. Nobuyuki thinks 
to himself "
Tenchi you are so serious just like your mother. You work very hard to make 
everything you 
Do  perfect." "She would be so proud of you".  As a tear comes to Nobuyuki's 
right eye. He
Quickly wipes it away before tenchi can see. 

                   
                           
   
As tenchi  gets up to leave, he grabs his clock and sleeping bag, and  says 
"good night dad".
"Good night" says Nobuyuki. As tenchi walks through the house to the living 
room. He
pauses at the entrance to the living room. He sees  that five very special 
ladies, are watching a movie and eating popcorn. With only a few lights on.

Ryoko's cat eyes spot tenchi first in the darkened room.  And Ryoko says "I see 
someone is of to bed,
Early tonight!". "I'd join you but I have a prior engagement tonight". "Someone 
wants me to sleep,
In his bed tonight".

"Ha Ha" says tenchi in a very droll voice. This causes Sasami to giggle, and 
Washu to smile and say softly
"Well said ". Mihoshi looks up and says "It's a beautiful night tonight tenchi". 
"If you where not serving
me breakfast I'd join you outside."  "The crescent moon is just wonderful".

Now Ayeka says "lord tenchi I am assigning one of my guardians to be with you 
tonight".  "That's not 
Necessary Ayeka" says Tenchi.  "Lord Tenchi I decide what is important for the 
guardians to guard". 
"And you are important!".  With four heads going up and down, tenchi gets the 
message.

"Thank you Ayeka" says Tenchi. "Your welcome lord Tenchi" says Ayeka with a bow.  
As Tenchi
Walks out the living room, to the deck. Five ladies are watching Tenchi. Ryoko 
splits herself in
half one to stay in the living room. The other to go through the floor boards, 
and come up outside
the house. To watch tenchi lay down and go to sleep. About ten minutes later 
Ryoko's other half
Comes back  to the house, through the floorboards and rejoins Ryoko.
______________________________________________________________________

Morning comes too early and quickly, now 20 minutes before sunrise. Tenchi's 
alarm clock goes off.
Tenchi wakes up completely, gets out of his sleeping bag. Rolls it up and takes 
it inside the house quietly.
To his dads bedroom, while trying not to wake Mihoshi

But tenchi forgets Mihoshi sleeps dead to the world, she is very hard to wake 
up.

As tenchi quietly enters his dads bedroom, trying not to wake him up. Tenchi 
sees his father
Already awake sitting up in bed, and tenchi says. "I'm sorry I woke you up dad."
"Forget it son, I was having a hard time sleeping so you did not wake me up" 
says Nobuyuki.

"Oh good " says tenchi. "well I must run up to the shrine, I am on a tight 
schedule" says tenchi.

A happy and full of energy tenchi, takes the steps of the shrine two at a time. 
Tenchi goes to the back
Corner of the main tree at the shrine. He is the only person there, in the 
predawn light.  Tenchi
Takes out a prayer strip with loving care, Kisses it and says "Ryoko" in a 
loving voice.
He ties it to a low  tree branch, with a small pink ribbon strip.

The prayer hangs about 5 feet off the ground, and the top and is two feet long. 
Tenchi repeats the
Process four more times. He says each ladies name Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Washu, 
and kisses
The prayer.  He ties them in a four-foot circle, from the trees low branches. 
And all about the same
Height off the ground.

Tenchi then stands in the center of the circle kneels down. Sits on his feet and 
places his hands on his knees.
Takes a deep breath, bows his head and closes his eyes. And say a short prayer 
out loud.

A happy smiling tenchi gets up, grabs his school bag and walks back to the 
house. Not looking
Back once.



Tenchi enters the house quietly, so as not to wake anyone, and heads to his 
dad's room. To get his
Cooking apron, and temple cloths, before taking his morning bath. Now tenchi 
thinks to himself
"Serving the ladies in my temple cloths will add a special touch to the 
presentation".

As tenchi enters his dad's bedroom quietly, he sees that his dad  is not in bed. 
"He must be taking a
Morning walk" thinks tenchi. "and the breakfast trays are not here; dad must 
have moved them,
To the kitchen for me. Thanks again sometimes parents can be a big help." "Then 
I will grab
The scrolls and place them in the kitchen with the breakfast trays".

Tenchi says "now off to grab a quick shower". Tenchi quietly walks to the 
kitchen with his cloths and scrolls.  He places the scrolls on the kitchen 
table, then quietly runs up the stairs. At the top
He pauses to look down the stairs at Mihoshi. With her blond hair spread out 
around her head and
Her so honest and innocent looking. Tenchi thinks to himself  "it would be 
relaxing to watch Mihoshi
Sleep".

Then another though creeps into Tenchi's mind, "maybe that saying about a 
persons true self
Being exposed during sleep is true" is his last though as he walks into the 
bathroom.

After a quick five minute shower and  tea brushing. Tenchi puts on the light 
brown and cream outfit.
That he has warn during past shrine ceremonies, and places the cooking apron 
over everything.
He then rolls up his sleeves and ties them back over his elbows. And says "I am 
ready to
Do battle in the kitchen".
