Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami, and Ryoko stand together.

Grandfather, Washu, Mihoshi, Ryoe, Daijiro, and Kazuhiko look at the four.

SASAMI
Did you say you were pregnant Ayeka?

AYEKA
Yes.

Sasami starts jumping around the room.

SASAMI
I'm going to be an auntie!  I'm going to be an auntie!

TENCHI
How long have you known Ayeka?

AYEKA
I suspected that I was pregnant last week.  It was confirmed today by
Misaki.

Tenchi joins Sasami in jumping around the room.

TENCHI
I'm going to be a father!  I'm going to be a father!

Sasami and Tenchi start dancing together.

AYEKA
They both are taking this rather well.

RYOKO
Congratulations princess you got there first.

RYOE
That is great news Ayeka.

Everyone, except Tenchi and Sasami, gather around Ayeka to congratulate
her.

WASHU
Why the emergency meeting Ayeka?

AYEKA
I was afraid that everyone would be upset by the news.

MIHOSHI
Upset.  This is wonderful news.  It will be like having Taro over all
the time.

RYOKO
Oh, I forgot about that.  This is not going to be easy is it?

WASHU
It never is but you will learn.

AYEKA
Everyone is okay with this.

Sasami and Tenchi join the group.

SASAMI
I'm so happy sister.

Tenchi kisses Ayeka.

TENCHI
This is fantastic news.  How long does it take someone from Jurai?

SASAMI
Tenchi you are still silly.  It takes nine months just like on Earth.

TENCHI
Misaki knows.  How about Funaho and Azusa?

AYEKA
Funaho knows also.  We have not told Azusa yet.

TENCHI
Mihoshi did you bring your bracelet.  Let's go tell him now.

MIHOSHI
I have it right here.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet and the group disappears.

INT. Landing pad at the royal palace - NIGHT

The group appears on the landing pad.

Everyone is still in their pajamas.

AYEKA
Shouldn't we have changed first?

TENCHI
No time for that now.  Let's wake up the palace.

Azaka and Kamidake approach the group.

AZAKA
Greeting princess, what brings you here so late?

TENCHI
We wish to see the emperor now.

KAMIDAKE
May I ask why?

TENCHI
His eldest daughter is carrying his grandchild.

AZAKA
Please, this way.

The group moves into the palace.

FADE IN:

INT. Family room - NIGHT

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami with Ryo-Ohki, Ryoe, Daijiro, Kazuhiko,
Mihoshi, Washu, and Grandfather materialize in the family room.

TENCHI
That went pretty well.  The emperor took the news much better than
I expected.

AYEKA
Yes, father wasn't his usual grumpy self.

SASAMI
I think Misaki must have told him.

GRANDFATHER
Well I have had enough excitement for one night so I am going to bed.

Grandfather leaves the room followed by Washu.

TENCHI
Good night Grandfather.  Good night Little Washu.  Mihoshi would you
please send a message to Kiyone to let her know the good news.

MIHOSHI
Okay Tenchi.  I will take care of that now before I forget.

Mihoshi leaves the room.

DAIJIRO
I may as well get some sleep tonight.

I am going to bed too.

Good night everyone.

The rest move out of the family room.

INT. Master bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi and Ayeka walk in.

TENCHI
How are you feeling Ayeka?

AYEKA
I feel wonderful.  I am sorry that I could not trust you earlier.

TENCHI
I love you Ayeka.  Our child will grow up with the most caring of
families.

A knock on the door.

TENCHI
Yes?

Ryoko phases through the door.

RYOKO
Hello.

AYEKA
Ryoko it is my ni...  Hello Ryoko.

TENCHI
Will you be staying here tonight?

RYOKO
I just want to talk.

All three sit on the bed.

Tenchi is in the middle and holds Ayeka and Ryoko's hand.

TENCHI
How do you really feel about this Ryoko?

RYOKO
I am jealous, but I am also happy for you Ayeka.  I will be an auntie
just like Sasami.

Ayeka looks down in her lap.

AYEKA
Thank you Ryoko.

TENCHI
Do you wish to join Ayeka?

RYOKO
No.  Not yet my love.  I think I can wait a little longer to give Ayeka's
child a younger sister.

Ayeka looks up.

AYEKA
A sister?

RYOKO
I trust in Tenchi's dreams.  I will let you know that I will teach your
child everything I know, and spoil it completely.

TENCHI
Thank you Ryoko.

Ryoko kisses each of them.

RYOKO
Good night.

Ryoko phases through the door.

AYEKA
She has changed so much.

TENCHI
You think so.  I think she is just being Ryoko.

AYEKA
But more and more Zero is coming out on top.

What are your plans now Tenchi?

TENCHI
We will return home the day after tomorrow.

MISAKI
This could be your home.

TENCHI
I enjoyed visiting here, and I will enjoy coming back again.  But my home
will always be Earth.

AZUSA
Ayeka, Sasami do you agree with this.

AYEKA
I will follow my husband anywhere in the universe.

SASAMI
If Tenchi is my guardian then I will have to stay near him.

AZUSA
As your guardian he will have to stay near you.

SASAMI
Then it is a good thing that he is returning to Earth.  Otherwise I would
have to force him since that is where I am going.

AZUSA
Yoshou, what do you have to say?

YOSHOU
I was returning to Earth regardless of Tenchi's decision.

AZUSA
I see.  Then everyone has decided?

MISAKI
Yes they have husband.  Now give them your blessing so we may continue
this celebration on a happy note.

Azusa stands.

AZUSA
Ayeka I wish you happiness.  Remember, whatever the future may bring you,
you always have a home here.  Sasami, one day you will have to return to
take the throne.  That is your duty and I will not...  And I wish you
whatever happiness you may find until then.

Azusa sits back down.

SASAMI
Thank you father.

AYEKA
Thank you father.

Jurai reappears on the view screen.

TENCHI
It is never easy saying good bye to those you love.

Tenchi leaves the bridge.

Ayeka and Ryoko follow him.

RYOE
Are we taking the same route back?

MIHOSHI
Yes, it is the fastest way.

RYOE
Can we stop at the desert world?

Mihoshi nods her head.

RYOE
Thank you.

Ryoe takes Daijiro's arm and they leave the bridge.

SASAMI
Well I am going to start lunch.

Grandfather and Washu follow Sasami off the bridge.

Kazuhiko moves to the command chair.

KAZUHIKO
Can you show me how to control this ship?

MIHOSHI
Sure.  Yukinojo does most of the work but I can show you the manual
systems.  Yukinojo!

Yukinojo drops down from the ceiling.

YUKINOJO
Yes Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Bring up the training program for Kazuhiko.  We are going to make him a
galaxy police detective!

YUKINOJO
I didn't say I wanted to be a policeman!

MIHOSHI
Hey it's just part of the training to run the ship.  Relax it will be fun.

YUKINOJO
Please direct your attention to the console.

INT. Dining room - NIGHT (Saturday, 25 April 1998; 23rd Day, 2nd Month)

Dinner has just started.

Grandfather sits at the end nearest the kitchen, and Kazuhiko sits at the

Mihoshi.  To his left sit Washu, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki in her girl form,
Daijiro, and Ryoe.

MIHOSHI
Tomorrow we will be in the KAL system.

TENCHI
Are you sure you want to visit this system Ryoe?

RYOE
Yes.  I need to close this part of my life.  I need Daijiro with me to
do it.

RYOKO
I will take you down in Ryo-Ohki.

RYOE
I would prefer that just the two of us went down.

MIHOSHI
I can transport you down to the surface.  The radiation level is still
high in that one area.

RYOE
Little Washu has taken care of that problem.

Tenchi looks over at Washu.

WASHU
She asked and I understand.

TENCHI
How long will you be down there?

DAIJIRO
As long as it takes.

Tenchi nods his head.		

EXT. Desert planet - Day (Sunday, 26 April 1998; 24th Day, 2nd Month)

Daijiro and Ryoe materialize on the planet surface.

They stand on a small ridge.

RYOE
This is the spot where you died.

Ryoe falls to her knees and begins crying

Daijiro kneels beside her and holds her tightly.

DAIJIRO
I love you Ryoe.  Let it out let it all out.

A high energy whine is heard.

Ryoe feels a jolt as Daijiro falls away from her.

She looks down at Daijiro laying on the ground.

RYOE
Not again!

Ryoe looks around through teary eyes.

EXT. Desert planet - Day

Ryoe kneels on the desert floor with Daijiro laying next to her.

About twenty paces away stand one of Shihou's soldiers.

The soldier has a rifle to his shoulder.

Ryoe looks at the soldier.

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. Family room - DAY

Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, and Mihoshi are watching television.

Kazuhiko comes running into the room.

Panic shows on his face.

KAZUHIKO
Something is wrong Tenchi!

TENCHI
What is it?

KAZUHIKO
Something has happened to Daijiro and Ryoe!

TENCHI
Calm down Kazuhiko.  How do you know that something is wrong?  Did they
call you?

Kazuhiko takes several deep breaths.

KAZUHIKO
Well Mihoshi has been teaching me how to fly the ship.  I have been
practicing with the ship's sensors.

AYEKA
You have been spying on Ryoe and Daijiro?

Kazuhiko nods his head.
		
TENCHI
More of that later.  How do you know they are in trouble?

KAZUHIKO
They were at the spot that.  Well where. You know.

TENCHI
Yes, go on.

KAZUHIKO
Anyway they suddenly went into the mountains.

MIHOSHI
Probably to that canyon we were in.

KAZUHIKO
No it is a different location.  They are in a cave now.

RYOKO
I think we should leave them alone so they can find what was lost.

KAZUHIKO
They got to the cave to fast!  They did not walk there.  It is like they
were flown or driven there.  And since they got there they have not moved,
like they are asleep or unconscious.

SASAMI
I am worried Tenchi.  I think we should make sure they are okay.

TENCHI
Yes Sasami, I think you are right.  Ryoko please call Washu.

RYOKO (expressed as thought)
Mom we need you now.

Washu walks in wearing Grandfather's shirt.  It covers her to her knees.

WASHU
What's up?

TENCHI
Something has happened to Daijiro and Ryoe and you probably have better
equipment than Yukinojo.

WASHU
Do you know where they are?

KAZUHIKO
Yukinojo does.

Washu's keyboard materializes in front of her.

WASHU
Mihoshi have you changed your access code this year?

Mihoshi shakes her head.

Washu enters some commands.

WASHU
They are alive but their life readings are very low.  They have either
been stunned or seriously injured.

As Tenchi stands his clothes are replaced with his Jurai battle armor.

Ayeka also changes her clothes to battle armor.

KAZUHIKO
Don't leave without me.  I have to get my stuff.

Kazuhiko runs out of the room.

TENCHI
Where do you think you are going Ayeka?

AYEKA
With you of course.

Tenchi walks over to her and places his hand on her stomach.

TENCHI
No, you are not.

AYEKA
Without you I won't be able to go on.

TENCHI
This is the reason to go on.  My father made it okay and so will you.
Tell her Ryoko.

Ryoko walks up to both of them.

RYOKO
If you asked me four months from now I would agree with you.  Now,
Tenchi, you are wrong and I am on Ayeka's side in this.

TENCHI
The baby!  You are saying that because you don't care if she dies!

The back of Ryoko's hand moved with lighting speed as she slaps Tenchi
in the face.

Tenchi finds himself partially imbedded in the far wall.

Kazuhiko enters the room.

He wears his battle armor, has his swords, and is carrying a rifle.

Ayeka rushes to Tenchi's side.

KAZUHIKO
I am ready to...

Kazuhiko stares at the scene before him.

Ryoko walks toward Ayeka and Tenchi.

The rest look on.

AYEKA
Ryoko, you could have killed him.

RYOKO
If he weren't wearing that battle armor he would be dead, but then
I would't have hit him so hard.

Ryoko reaches the couple.

Ayeka shields Tenchi with her body.

Tenchi looks at Ryoko with fear in his eye.

AYEKA
Why Ryoko.  You never cared for me.

Ryoko raises her hand again.

She lowers it.

RYOKO
I will not risk Tenchi's child.  When we first met on your ship I hated
you Ayeka.  I couldn't fight you then, although I would never admit to
it.  When Ryo-Ohki was reborn I could have killed you easily, and that
is no boast, but I couldn't.

AYEKA
Really Ryoko?  Are you sure you aren't boosting now?

RYOKO
Tenchi loved you, and I loved him.  If I had hurt you I would have hurt
him, and I would have lost my chance forever for him to love me.

Ayeka lets out a gasp and covers her mouth.

RYOKO
>From that day forward I could never have truly hurt you Ayeka.  I could
still beat the crap out of you as long as I received equal damage.

Ayeka looks up at Ryoko.

RYOKO
That way I wouldn't lose my chance at Tenchi's love.  I wanted Tenchi's
heart for myself and I was jealous of you.

AYEKA
That time on the Soja.  Those times when you could have gotten rid of me,
and no one would be the wiser.

RYOKO
Someone, or at least Washu, would have figured out how you came to any
harm.  I could not kill you Princess.  You laughed at me when I told you
of my love for Tenchi.  I never felt more powerless than I did on that
day.

AYEKA
I am so sorry Ryoko.

RYOKO
Only the gods know why Ayeka, but I love you more than just my sister.
Maybe some of what Sasami did to us still lingers in my heart.  If any
harm comes to you now Ayeka it will be because I am already dead.

AYEKA
Ryoko.

TENCHI
Please forgive me Ryoko.  I am so sorry to have hurt you with my words.

RYOKO
Well Tenchi I was worried about making you mad.  I guess you did it to me
instead.  I will let you try to make up later.

AYEKA
If my older sister had said I should stay then I would.  She didn't and
I am going with you.

Tenchi stands up.

TENCHI
I surrender.  I will be happy to have my wives accompany me.

WASHU
I will stay with Yukinojo incase they try to attack us in space.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Ms. Washu.

Mihoshi draws her blaster.

SASAMI
I am going too.

AYEKA
Sasami you are...  Thank you Sasami we can use your help.

TENCHI
Ayeka what are you saying?

AYEKA
I am saying that I too can bend when it is time to do so.

All the girls look at Tenchi.

TENCHI
Are you sure Sasami?

Sasami transforms into her battle armor.

KAZUHIKO
We need a site near the cave but out of general view.

Washu types on her keyboard.

WASHU
I have locked in the spot with Yukinojo, Mihoshi.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet.

Washu finds herself standing alone in the family room.

WASHU
Good luck.

Grandfather enters the room.

He stands behind Washu and places his hands on her shoulders.

EXT. Desert planet - DAY

A shallow ravine.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Sasami, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi appear in the ravine.

Sasami is carrying Ryo-Ohki.

Mihoshi looks at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
They are in a cave about 800 yards that way.

RYOKO
Sasami set Ryo-Ohki down please.

Sasami sets Ryo-Ohki on the ground.

RYOKO (expressed as thought)
Do your job and scout the area Ryo-Ohki.

RYO-OHKI
Meow!

Ryo-Ohki runs up the side of the ravine and disappears.

SASAMI
Ryo-Ohki!

TENCHI
Where is she going?

RYOKO
It is like the old days for me Tenchi.  She is going to scout out the
defenses and look for their weak spots.  How do you think I was such
a successful space pirate?

Ryoko sits down and places her hands against her temples.

INT. Control room - DAY

One officer stands in the middle of the room.

Four other soldiers attend to their consoles.

SOLDIER
Sir, the police ship is sending out a broadband jamming signal.  It is
interfering with our sensors.

LIEUTENANT
Go to full alert.  They must have already landed on the planet.

A claxon sounds.

LIEUTENANT
Double the guard on the prisoners.  That is where they will strike first.
Kill the prisoners if it is the only way to prevent their recaptured.
I need them alive as bait.

SOLDIER
Yes sir!

LIEUTENANT
Soon Lord Shihou you will be avenged.

EXT. Ravine - DAY

Ryoko sits on the ground with her hands to her temple.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami, Kazuhiko, and Mihoshi watch her.

RYOKO
They have sounded the alarm.  They know something is up.

SASAMI
Is Ryo-Ohki okay?

RYOKO
Yes she is fine.  They have not detected her yet.

TENCHI
Has she found a way in?

RYOKO
Not a way that you can take.  Just give her some more time. 

KAZUHIKO
If they are alerted now we had best be prepared to receive them.

AYEKA
I will stay her and shield Ryoko.

KAZUHIKO
Okay.  Tenchi you and Mihoshi take a position over at that end of the
ravine where Ryo-Ohki went.  I will cover this end.

SASAMI
I will go with you Kazuhiko.

Kazuhiko looks at Sasami and then at Tenchi.

TENCHI
Okay Sasami.

Tenchi and Mihoshi move to the far end of the ravine.

Kazuhiko and Sasami move to the near end.

RYOKO
Is Sasami going to be all right?

AYEKA
I only protect her because I think she is a little girl.  She isn't a
little girl anymore and I will have to let her go.

RYOKO
She has grown quite a bit.  I have a feeling we will be adjusting our
schedule with Tenchi soon.

AYEKA
Ryoko!

RYOKO
I'm not jealous, so why should you be?

Ayeka looks down at her feet.

RYOKO
Even if she is better than we are she still loves us.  She will make
sure that Tenchi does not forget about us.

AYEKA
In my heart I know you are right Ryoko.  If I could only get my mind
to agree with my heart everything would be fine.

RYOKO
You have time princess.  She still has a lot of work to do changing
Tenchi's mind to match his heart.

Ayeka places her hands on her stomach.

RYOKO
Having second thought about being here?

AYEKA
I was just wondering what kind of world I will be bringing this child
into.  When I was young everything was peace and beauty.  The truth
is not as pretty.

RYOKO
The world is what we make it Ayeka.  Bastards like these can force us
into a corner but they can't take away our dreams.

AYEKA
Ryoko?

RYOKO
Yes, Princess.

AYEKA
Back at the house.  If our positions were switched I would have let you
come down here also.

Ryoko looks Ayeka in the eye.

AYEKA
Only, what Tenchi said would have been true.

RYOKO
I understand.

AYEKA
It's okay if you hate me now.

RYOKO
I love you Ayeka.  Your feelings for me do not come into this.

AYEKA
How can you Ryoko!  I just admitted that I would not mind seeing you dead!

Ayeka turns red and looks around her.

She sees everyone looking at her.

RYOKO
Hey!  This is a private conversation between sisters!  So you had better
keep your minds on the job at hand!

The other four return to keeping a look out.

AYEKA
Why do you defend me Ryoko?

RYOKO
One day you will learn.

Ryoko has a far away look.

AYEKA
What is it?

Ryoko does not respond.

AYEKA
Ryoko are you okay?

RYOKO
Washu says they have nuclear weapons.  You need to tell the others.
This could get very ugly.

Ayeka moves in the direction of Kazuhiko and Sasami.

Ryoko walks over to Tenchi and Mihoshi.

All six gather back together.

KAZUHIKO
This could be a suicide mission Tenchi.

TENCHI
What do you mean?

KAZUHIKO
If they are looking to avenge Shihou they will set off the nuke when
they are sure to get us with it.

TENCHI
I don't understand.

AYEKA
They are from Jurai.  They believe that they will join Shihou in the
spirit world if they are successful.

TENCHI
That is crazy.

RYOKO
The universe is full of crazy people.

MIHOSHI
Where do you think they have the weapon?

KAZUHIKO
Most likely it is where Ryoe and Daijiro are.

TENCHI
Mihoshi could you disarm the bomb?

Mihoshi nods her head.

KAZUHIKO
We should split up into two groups.  Our first priority will have to
be the nuke.

SASAMI
What about Ryoe and Daijiro.

KAZUHIKO
If they detonate the bomb that won't matter anymore.

SASAMI
Oh.

KAZUHIKO
How do we split up?

RYOKO and AYEKA
I am with Tenchi.

TENCHI
I guess then that it will be you three.

SASAMI
Shouldn't Mihoshi stay with you Tenchi?

KAZUHIKO
I believe that Mihoshi can influence things even when she is not next
to him.

MIHOSHI
What do you mean by that?

KAZUHIKO
Things just work out when you are around.

MIHOSHI
Oh that I am in the right place at the right time.

TENCHI
Yes Mihoshi.  Okay what do we do next?

KAZUHIKO
Have you found the entrance Ryoko?

RYOKO
Yes.  Ryo-Ohki is inside looking at the entrance now.  She says that
there are about ten soldiers armed with rifles.  Jurai military issue.
She is going to go deeper into the cave now.

KAZUHIKO
Tenchi, my group will distract the guards and have them chase after us.
You can then slip inside and start a diversion.  We will trap the
outside force between us.

TENCHI
Okay, sounds good to me.

KAZUHIKO
How many more are inside?

RYOKO
She is still looking around.  Ah she has found a control center.  One
room is blocked with a force field.  She can't see inside or pass through
the wall.  There are about ten more inside scattered around.

KAZUHIKO
That is too many.  When you get inside Tenchi you will have to assault
the guards and get past the force field.  We will keep the outside group
busy and off your back.

RYOKO
I will have Ryo-Ohki chew up the computer wiring.  That will cause them
some confusion.

KAZUHIKO
Give us about 15 minutes before you follow.

Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, and Sasami move out.

TENCHI
Take care of yourselves.

The three move out of site.

AYEKA
I will take care of our defense while you two take care of the offense.

RYOKO
Sounds good to me.

EXT. Cave entrance - DAY

Ten soldiers stand around the entrance.

EXT. Slope - DAY

Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, and Sasami crawl up to the top of the slope.

They look over.

MIHOSHI
They have a force field protecting them.

SASAMI
I will take care of that.

Sasami moves back down the slope.

Sasami summons five wings of the light hawk.

MIHOSHI
I didn't know that you could do that.

SASAMI
I am my mother's daughter.  I found out I could do this the day after
I became a woman.

Sasami concentrates.

SASAMI
Get ready.

She moves to the top of the slope.

The soldiers see her and raise their weapons.

She points her hand at the group of soldiers.

One wing moves from her to the group.

The ground around the soldiers explodes.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko open fire.

KAZUHIKO
Let's go.

Sasami extends a force field around them.

The three move away from the cave.

EXT. Ravine - DAY

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko stand there.

Tenchi looks at his watch.

TENCHI
Time to go.

The three move out of the ravine.

They hear an explosion.

TENCHI
That is our cue.  Let's hurry up.

All three start running.

They reach the cave entrance.

There are several soldiers laying on the ground.

All three rush inside the cave.

EXT. Rocky area - DAY

Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, and Sasami enter the scene.

KAZUHIKO
How many are following us?

Mihoshi looks at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
Six.		

KAZUHIKO
Let's make our stand here.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko drop to the ground with their weapons ready.

Sasami kneels between them keeping the shield up.

Two soldiers enter the scene.

Mihoshi fires dropping one of them.

The other fires and hits Kazuhiko in the shoulder.

Kazuhiko is thrown back about five yards.

SASAMI
My shield didn't work!

MIHOSHI
They are using neuro weapons!

Mihoshi drops the solder with another shot.

More come around the corner.

One fires at Sasami.

Ryo-Ohki in her girl form appears in front of Sasami.

The beam hits her in the chest knocking her back into Sasami.

RYO-OHKI
Miya!

Ryo-Ohki raises her hand and a beam of energy shoots out.

The area around the soldiers becomes a huge crater.

SASAMI
Thank you Ryo-Ohki.

RYO-OHKI
Miya.  Miya?

Ryo-Ohki touches Kazuhiko.

MIHOSHI
He will be okay after a while.  I am going to send him back to the ship.

Kazuhiko disappears.

SASAMI
We have to help the others.

Mihoshi nods her head.

Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki move back to the cave.

INT. Family room - DAY

Washu sits at her keyboard sipping tea.

Grandfather sits behind her sipping tea.

WASHU
Ryo-Ohki has learned a new trick.

GRANDFATHER
What?

WASHU
She can fire her starship weapons while in her girl form.

GRANDFATHER
That does not sound very safe to use while on the planet's surface.

WASHU
True, but with some training she could reduce the energy discharge.

INT. Cave - DAY

Tenchi and Ryoko each carry their Light Hawk Wing sword.

Ayeka maintains a shield around them.

A group of soldiers step out from two alcoves.

Ryoko sends energy blasts into the soldiers.

One fires his rife, hitting Ayeka in the chest.

The hit throws Ayeka against the far wall.

Tenchi leaps in among the soldiers cutting them down.

Ryoko rushes to Ayeka's side.

Tenchi joins her.

RYOKO
She is alive but stunned.

TENCHI
That weapon went through her shield like it wasn't there.

RYOKO
I will carry her.  We must find that bomb.

Ryoko picks up Ayeka and drapes her across her shoulders.

Tenchi and Ryoko move past the carnage.

RYOKO
The control room is through there.

They enter the control room.

RYOKO
Ryo-Ohki did a good job.  The force field is down.

EXT. Cave entrance - DAY

Mihoshi, Sasami, and Ryo-Ohki approach the entrance.

Sasami still has her shield up.

They enter the cave.

Mihoshi's bracelet beeps.

MIHOSHI
Here they come!

A group of soldiers come around a bend.

Ryo-Ohki raises her hand.

RYO-OHKI
Miya!

SASAMI
Ryo-Ohki!

INT. Small room.

The lieutenant sits in the room next to a black box.

Ryoe and Daijiro lay next to him.

Both are unconscious.

Tenchi and Ryoko, still carrying Ayeka, enter the room.

LIEUTENANT
Ryoko I presume.

RYOKO
That's right.

INT. Cave hallway - DAY

Ryo-Ohki sends an energy blast from her hand.

Mihoshi tackles Ryo-Ohki and Sasami to the ground.

Shrapnel from the blast bounce off Sasami's shield.

They lay out in the open surrounded by rubble.

Most of the cliff face is gone.

INT. Small room - DAY

An explosion rocks the room.

Ryoko grabs Tenchi's hand as she falls to her knees.

LIEUTENANT
Die Ryoko.

The lieutenant drops a small black box from his hand.

A bright white light fills the room.

EXT. Rubble - DAY

Mihoshi still covers Sasami and Ryo-Ohki laying on the ground.

The sky fills with a brilliant white light.

INT. Family room - DAY

Washu screams and covers her face.

An unseen force pushes her backward into Grandfathers arms.

Grandfather holds Washu tightly as she continues to scream.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

EXT. Rubble - DAY

Sasami, Ryo-Ohki lay on the ground with Mihoshi on top of them.

SASAMI
Where is that bright light coming from?  I can not even look in that
direction.

MIHOSHI
Oh my.

SASAMI
What is it Mihoshi?

Mihoshi looks at her bracelet.

MIHOSHI
This says that there is a star on the planet's surface.

SASAMI
How can that be?

MIHOSHI
I don't know.  I had better take a look.

Mihoshi twists her cube and out pops some wrap around sunglasses.

Mihoshi puts on the sunglasses and stands up.

MIHOSHI
I am going to send you two back up to the ship.

SASAMI
Please let me stay with you.

MIHOSHI
I don't have another pair of sunglasses Sasami and I don't want to leave
you here alone.

SASAMI
I have Ryo-Ohki with me.

MIHOSHI
Someone needs to take care of Kazuhiko.

SASAMI
Okay.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet and Sasami and Ryo-Ohki disappear.

She walks toward the light.

INT. Family room = DAY

Grandfather holds Washu in his arms.

Washu has her face covered with her hands and is sobbing.

Sasami and Ryo-Ohki appear.

SASAMI
What is wrong with Ms. Washu?

GRANDFATHER
I don't know Sasami.  She is in pain and I don't know why.

SASAMI
Mihoshi said that there was a star on the planet's surface.

GRANDFATHER
A star?

SASAMI
That is what she said.  Where is Kazuhiko?

GRANDFATHER
He is resting in his bed.  Washu said he would be all right.

Sasami nods her head.

She walks over to Washu and lays her hand on Washu's face.

SASAMI
I am going to try something.

Grandfather nods his head.

SASAMI (expressed as thought)
By the royal seal in my true name I ask you to help Washu.  Heaven to
ocean, ocean to earth, earth back to heaven.  Tsunami, grant my wish
and help Washu.

Washu shudders and takes a deep breath.

WASHU
You have severed my link with Ryoko.

SASAMI
It is only temporary.  You were trapped in the link and unable to take
any action.

WASHU
She is blind and in terrible pain.

Washu's keyboard disappears and reappears in front of her.

She types a few commands.

WASHU
There is an ongoing nuclear explosion on the planet.

SASAMI
Mihoshi said there was a star on the surface.

WASHU
That is a close analogy.

SASAMI
Mihoshi said she would take care of it and sent me back to the ship.

WASHU
None of these readings make any sense.  How can a ditz like Mihoshi take
care of this?

GRANDFATHER
That is an easy question.  She is Mihoshi and nothing else need be said.

EXT. What is left of the small room - DAY

A sphere of white light is in the center of the room.

Mihoshi walks up to the light.

She sees Ryoko, Tenchi, and Ayeka laying on the ground in front of her.

She notices that Tenchi and Ryoko are holding hands.

MIHOSHI
That is so sweet.  They act like young lovers holding hands.

Mihoshi walks around the light to the left.

She sees the lieutenant laying on the ground.

MIHOSHI
Well you definitely are not a nice person.

Mihoshi rolls the lieutenant onto his stomach.

She handcuffs his hands behind his back.

She continues to walk around the light.

She sees Ryoe and Daijiro laying on the ground.

She checks them.

MIHOSHI
Both of you will be fine.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet and they disappear.

She continues to walk around until she is back to Tenchi.

MIHOSHI
Now where did I put that thing?

INT. Family room - DAY

Washu studies the data on her keyboard while she sits in Grandfathers lap.

Sasami returns to the room with some more tea.

Ryoe and Daijiro materialize on the floor.

SASAMI
They're back!

Washu looks over at Ryoe and Daijiro

She types on her keyboard.

WASHU
Please take them to their room Grandfather.  They will be fine after
some rest.

Grandfather sits Washu on the floor and stands up.

He picks up Ryoe and carries her from the room.

SASAMI
What is happening, Ms. Washu?

WASHU
I don't know Sasami but Mihoshi and me are going to have a long talk.

EXT. What is left of the small room - DAY

Mihoshi stands next to the sphere of light.

Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and the lieutenant lay on the floor.

Mihoshi pulls out a clear glass tube about 12 inches long and 3 inches
across.

She holds one end of the tube and pushes the other end into the light.

The sphere shrinks and the tube takes on a golden glow.

When all the light is gone Mihoshi puts away the tube.

She takes off her sunglasses.

MIHOSHI
Okay, now that is finished.  Let's go home.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet.

The room is empty.

INT. Family room - DAY

Washu sits in front of her keyboard drinking tea.

Sasami sits on the couch drinking tea.

Both Ryoe and Daijiro are gone.

Grandfather enters the room.

SASAMI
There is tea on the table for you Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Thank you Sasami.  What is happening now Washu?

Grandfather picks up a cup of tea.

He sits behind Washu and puts her back in his lap.

WASHU
The explosion is gone.  I am not sure where it went.

Mihoshi materializes in the room.

With her, laying on the floor, are Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, and the
lieutenant.

MIHOSHI
Hi.  Is there any tea left?

Washu
What did you do and who is that?

Mihoshi
He's not a very nice person at all.  Are there any cookies left Sasami?

SASAMI
I will get you some.

Sasami leaves the room.

Washu types on her keyboard.

WASHU
You are avoiding my question Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
What question?

WASHU
Arrrgggg!

Washu would have jumped to her feet if Grandfather didn't still hold her.

Mihoshi smiles.

Sasami enters the room with a plate of cookies.

She walks over to Mihoshi and offers her some.

SASAMI
What happened?

Mihoshi takes two.

Washu is doing her deep breathing exercises.

MIHOSHI
Not much.  Apparently the explosion took place in a containment field.

WASHU
What kind of containment field.

MIHOSHI
You will have to ask Tenchi and Ryoko about that.  How are they?  All
three are in a lot of pain.

Sasami covers her mouth and looks worried.

SASAMI
Do something Ms. Washu!

WASHU
I am Sasami.  Both are resting now.  You can let go of me Yoshou.  I will
not kill anyone.  Take those three to their room.

Washu types a couple of commands.

A portal appears.

WASHU
You can toss the prisoner in there.

Grandfather stands and tosses the lieutenant through the portal.

The portal disappears.

He picks up Ayeka and leaves the room.

WASHU
Please tell me everything you did Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Well this morning I went...

WASHU (overlapping)
Please Mihoshi just the details on what you did to the explosion.

MIHOSHI
Oh, that.  I put it in here.

Mihoshi pulls out the glass tube.

It has a golden glow.

WASHU
That is an ultra energy containment tube.

MIHOSHI
I always carry some with me ever since I solved that ultra energy robbery.

WASHU
That was a true story?

Mihoshi starts to cry.

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu, how could you doubt me.

SASAMI
That was not nice Ms. Washu.

WASHU
I am sorry Mihoshi.  Here have another cookie.

Mihoshi face brightens.

MIHOSHI
Thank you.

WASHU
How did you use that?

Grandfather returns and picks up Ryoko.

He leaves the room.

MIHOSHI
There is a recharge button.  I used the explosion's energy to recharge
the tube.  I didn't get much though.  Less than one percent fill.

WASHU
How did you know to do that?

MIHOSHI
I use these all the time to keep Yukinojo charged up.  I usually go to
the station power core and recharge my tube there.  I can sometimes get
as much as a three percent fill without disrupting station power.

WASHU
How much energy can that hold?

MIHOSHI
I don't know.  I have never filled it up.

WASHU
My data shows that it was a ten megaton explosion.  So. Wow that can hold
a lot of energy.  Could I have one please?

MIHOSHI
Okay you can have this one or do you want an empty one.

WASHU
An empty one please.  Then I can see how much it can hold.

Mihoshi pulls out another tube with out a glow.

She hands it to Washu.

WASHU
Well that wraps everything up.

Mihoshi pulls a rifle from behind her back and lays it on the table.

SASAMI
That is the type of rifle that soldier used to shoot Kazuhiko.  It shot
right through my shield.

WASHU
That is not Jurai technology.

MIHOSHI
It is from Chisaioto

Washu picks up the rifle.

WASHU
Isn't that in the WAO system?  They are an advanced technological race
but very xenophobic.  How do you know about them?

MIHOSHI
It was the second mission that Kiyone and me went on.

Grandfather returns and picks up Tenchi.

He leaves the room.

SASAMI
Wow!  What happened?

MIHOSHI
It is a long and dull story.

WASHU
What does this do?  It looks like an energy beam weapon.

MIHOSHI
It is a neuro weapon.

Washu tosses the rifle back down on the table.

WASHU
A very nasty weapon.

Ryoko can be heard screaming upstairs.

GRANDFATHER (O. C.)
Come quickly Washu.

WASHU
Oh no Ryoko is awake!  Come with me Sasami.  Please don't send your
report until we talk some more Mihoshi.

Washu runs out of the room followed by Sasami.

MIHOSHI
Okay.

Mihoshi yawns and stretches.

She lies down on the couch.

INT. Master bedroom - DAY

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka lay in bed.

Tenchi is in the center with Ryoko on his right and Ayeka on his left.

Tenchi and Ayeka are asleep.

Ryoko is struggling and screaming.

Grandfather is showing a lot of effort to hold her down.

Washu and Sasami rush into the room.

WASHU
I am here Ryoko.

Washu takes Ryoko's hand.

RYOKO
Mommy I am scared of the dark.  I can't see you mommy.

WASHU
I am here.  You are blind Ryoko.

Ryoko stops struggling, but she is still crying.

RYOKO
Blind?  Will I heal?

WASHU
Yes you will regenerate your eyes.

RYOKO
Tenchi and Ayeka?

WASHU
They have been blinded too.

RYOKO
Can you help them?

WASHU
I have brought Sasami here to help them.

SASAMI
Ms. Washu, I am not sure that I can do that.

WASHU
If not, I can give Tenchi and Ayeka artificial eyes.

SASAMI
Very well then I will try.

Sasami moves over to Ayeka's side of the bed.

SASAMI
By the royal seal in my true name grant me the power to heal my friends.
Heaven to ocean, ocean to earth, earth back to heaven.  Tsunami, grant
me the power to heal.

TSUNAMI (expressed as thought)
Will you pay the price?

Pause for a five count.

SASAMI
Yes.

Sasami's body shudders.

Sasami bows her head low and reaches out to Ayeka.

Sasami touches Ayeka's eyes, and then she touches Tenchi's eyes.

SASAMI
Lay back down Ryoko.

Ryoko lies down.

Sasami lays across Ayeka and Tenchi to touch Ryoko's eyes.

Ryoko stops crying.

RYOKO
I can see.  I am no longer in the dark.

Sasami can be heard crying.

RYOKO
Sasami what is wrong?

SASAMI
It is over.

GRANDFATHER
What is over Sasami?

Sasami raises her head.

Her Jurai power marks have changed from two triangles to two dots.

SASAMI
My childhood is over.  I will never get it back.

WASHU
Are you Tsunami now?

SASAMI
No, I am still Sasami.  I will always be Sasami.  I understand now what
happened to me so long ago.

WASHU
Can you explain.

SASAMI
Not here and not now Little Washu.  I'm going to rest now.  Please wake
me when Tenchi and Ayeka have recovered.

Sasami reaches over Ayeka to kiss Tenchi on the lips.

She walks out of the room.

WASHU
She called me Little Washu.

GRANDFATHER
My sister has grown up very fast indeed.

RYOKO
What happened to Sasami?

GRANDFATHER
She has reached her full power.

WASHU
It is all my fault.  I should not have forced her to heal them.

Grandfather hugs Washu close.

GRANDFATHER
No you did not force her.  She knew what would happen if she drew on
Tsunami's power.  She was willing to pay the price.

WASHU
You need to rest Ryoko.  Those two should wake in the morning.

Ryoko looks very subdued.

RYOKO
Okay.

Washu and Grandfather leave the room.

INT. Family room - DAY

Mihoshi is asleep on the couch.

Kazuhiko sits on the couch looking at her.

Washu and Grandfather enter the room.

Looking in the room Grandfather takes hold of Washu's arm.

Kazuhiko looks up at the two of them.

GRANDFATHER
We did not mean to disturb you.

KAZUHIKO
Please come in.  I just woke up in my room and came down stairs.  I heard
Ryoko screaming.  Is she okay?

WASHU
She will be fine.

Kazuhiko looks down at Mihoshi.

KAZUHIKO
She saved all of us, didn't she?

WASHU
I don't know how she does it, but yes she did save everyone down there.

Kazuhiko points to the rifle on the table.

KAZUHIKO
That is the rifle that was used to shoot me.  I was under Sasami's shield
when I was shot.

WASHU
I am waiting for her to tell me more about it.  It was designed to
nullify the Power of Jurai.

Kazuhiko goes back to looking at Mihoshi.

GRANDFATHER
That is a very dangerous weapon.

WASHU
Yes it is.  How many more are out there.  I need to get the story from
her.

Grandfather and Washu watch Kazuhiko and Mihoshi.

WASHU
How do you feel about her, Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
I'm not sure.  Do I love her for herself, or because she saved my life?
Is it because she is so ditzy and needs my protection, or because she has
spent all this time training me to be a Galaxy Police Detective?  Is it
because she is so beautiful or because she is so kind and caring?

Mihoshi yawns and stretches.

MIHOSHI
You are so sweet Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
I didn't know you were awake.

MIHOSHI
People are so honest around me when I am sleeping.

WASHU
I need to know about that weapon.

Mihoshi sits up on the couch.

MIHOSHI
Could we eat first?  I am hungry.

KAZUHIKO
I will fix us something.

Kazuhiko exits for the kitchen.

WASHU
I will help him to speed things up.

Washu exits for the kitchen.

GRANDFATHER
Mihoshi, you do not have to tell us anything you don't want to.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Grandfather.  It is just that I have done some things that
I am not proud of.  I had to do them but I wish there had been another
way.

GRANDFATHER
I understand duty too well.

Both sit in silence while they wait.

Kazuhiko comes out with a tray of sandwiches.

Washu comes out with two pots of tea.

They set the food and drink on the table and sit on the other couch.

Everyone helps themselves to food and drink.

MIHOSHI
It was five years ago.  Yes, five years ago when Kiyone and I went out
on our second mission.

Mihoshi's flashback.

EXT. Space - DAY

Yukinojo in orbit around a reddish gray planet.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - DAY

Kiyone and Mihoshi sit in the command chairs.

YUKINOJO
We are in orbit around Chisaioto.

MIHOSHI
Thank you Yukinojo.  Please scan for heavily protected buildings.

KIYONE
What is our plan?

MIHOSHI
I don't have a plan.  We just find the place and shut it down.

YUKINOJO
I have found four buildings that have unusually high levels of force
field protection.

KIYONE
How many are government buildings?

YUKINOJO
Three of them are government buildings.

MIHOSHI
Okay then.  Let's visit the fourth one.

Mihoshi pushes a button and she and Kiyone disappear.

EXT. Urban area - DAY

Mihoshi and Kiyone stand in front of a black bubble.

The streets are empty.

KIYONE
This is a level ten force field.  There is no way in.  We will have to
cut power to it.

MIHOSHI
That sounds like a good idea.  Yukinojo!

YUKINOJO (O. C.)
Yes Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Where is the nearest power grid control cell?

YUKINOJO (O. C.)
It is at 134.3 mark 25.9.

KIYONE
That isn't too far.  We can walk there.

Mihoshi and Kiyone walk down the deserted streets.

They enter a small building.

INT. Control room - DAY

Mihoshi and Kiyone enter the room.

KIYONE
There appears to be no security systems for this control cell.  Now
I just have to see which of these feeds the force field.

MIHOSHI
I am thirsty.

Mihoshi pulls out her control cube and gives it a few twists.

Out pops a bottle of "Fizzy Pink".

Mihoshi opens the bottle and takes a drink.

MIHOSHI
Would you like some Kiyone?

KIYONE
I don't see how you can drink that stuff.

WASHU (O. C.)
That stuff tastes terrible.

INT. Family room - DAY

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit on one couch.

Grandfather and Washu sit on another couch.

WASHU
That drink is nothing but carbonated electrolytes.

MIHOSHI
Well I liked the flavor.

KAZUHIKO
What did it taste like?

MIHOSHI
Hmm, that is hard to describe.  I guess it tasted like sour watermelon.

Kazuhiko makes a face.

WASHU
Do you still drink it?

MIHOSHI
No, that was the last time I ever drank "Fizzy Pink".

Mihoshi's flashback.

INT. Control room - DAY

Mihoshi and Kiyone are in the room.

Kiyone is looking at a diagram.

Mihoshi sets her drink on a console.

KIYONE
Don't set that there.

MIHOSHI
What?

Mihoshi spins around knocking over the drink.

The drink pours into the console and the lights go out.

KIYONE
Yukinojo what just happened?

YUKINOJO (O. C.)
There is a planet wide power outage.

MIHOSHI
I'm sorry.

KIYONE
This is our chance to get into the factory.

Mihoshi and Kiyone leave the room.

EXT. Large factory - DAY

The force field is gone.

Mihoshi and Kiyone enter the factory.

INT. Large factory - DAY

Rifles are everywhere.

There are conveyer belts with rifles and automated machines.

Everything is turned off.

KIYONE
This is definitely the right building.  I will look for the controller
for the force field and disable it.

MIHOSHI
Okay Kiyone.

Mihoshi wanders around the building.

A red switch with the wording press in case of an emergency.

MIHOSHI
Kiyone would you say a planet wide power outage would be an emergency?

Kiyone takes the panel of a machine.

KIYONE
Yes I would.

MIHOSHI
Okay.

Mihoshi pushes the button.

Nothing happens.

MIHOSHI
That's strange.  Nothing happened.

KIYONE
Okay I have the force field generator disabled.  Let's go back and turn
on the power.

Mihoshi stares at the button for a moment.

MIHOSHI
Okay.

Mihoshi and Kiyone exit the factory.

INT. Control room - DAY

Mihoshi and Kiyone enter the control room.

KIYONE
How do I restore power?

MIHOSHI
Why not unplug the machine that I spilled the drink in?

Kiyone unplugs the machine.

The lights come on.

A loud explosion is heard.

The building shakes.

The lights go out.

KIYONE
Yukinojo what just happened?

Pause for a four count.

KIYONE
Yukinojo!

Kiyone checks her bracelet.

KIYONE
My bracelet is dead.  Is yours working Mihoshi?

Mihoshi checks hers.

MIHOSHI
No mine is dead too.

Kiyone pulls out her cube and it is a dull color.

Kiyone checks the rest of her equipment.
		
KIYONE
None of my stuff is working.

Mihoshi pulls out her cube and it is still bright.

MIHOSHI
My cube is still working.

KIYONE
Get a spare bracelet so we can find out what is going on.

Mihoshi twists her cube and a bracelet pops out.

She puts it on.

MIHOSHI
Yukinojo can you tell us what just happened.

YUKINOJO
The planet's power was restored.  There was a large explosion at 314.3
mark 25.9.  Then a planet wide power outage occurred.  Finally a massive
electromagnetic pulse effected all planetary systems.

KIYONE
That is the coordinate of the factory.  We need to get over there now.

Mihoshi and Kiyone run out of the room.

EXT. Large crater about three miles across - DAY

Mihoshi and Kiyone stand at the edge of the crater.

KIYONE
I think this mission is complete.

MIHOSHI
I would agree with you there.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet and they both disappear.

INT. Family room - DAY

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko sit on one couch.

Grandfather and Washu sit on another couch.

MIHOSHI
So Kiyone reported that the factory was destroyed.  All drawings, blue
prints, and the technology to make the weapons were also destroyed.

KAZUHIKO
That was great detective work Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Thank you.

WASHU
Chisaioto was a completely automated society.

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
They still have not fully recovered from our mission to their world.

WASHU
Let me see if I got this right.  You went down to the planet and spilled
your drink causing a planetary power outage.  This let you into the
factory where you could push the emergency destruction button.  Nothing
happened because the power was out.  You then went back and restored
power, which caused the factory to blow up because of the button you
pushed earlier.  The factories destruction caused a planetary power
outage followed by an EMP burst destroying all data systems on the planet.

Mihoshi blinks a couple of times and fidgets in her seat.

MIHOSHI
I guess you could put it that way, but it doesn't sound as good as my
story.

WASHU
Did you know that "Fizzy Pink" is a liquid super conductor?

MIHOSHI
Why no Ms. Washu.  What ever gave you that idea.

Washu shakes her head.

WASHU
So that weapon was smuggled off planet before you destroyed the factory.

MIHOSHI
There was not a lot of opportunity for that.  We destroyed the factory
about three weeks after it became operational.

GRANDFATHER
How did you get to the factory so soon after it started production?

MIHOSHI
We had an anonymous tip.

WASHU
I will have some drones look for any weapons left on the planet and also
to look for any more of Shihou's men.

MIHOSHI
Where's Sasami?

GRANDFATHER 
She said she was going to rest until morning.

MIHOSHI
Who will make supper tonight?

KAZUHIKO
I will make it.  I hope you all like sea bream steamed shinshu style.

GRANDFATHER
That is a very impressive dish.

KAZUHIKO
Being a bachelor has taught me to starve, go broke, or cook.

MIHOSHI
Would you like some help?

KAZUHIKO
Yes I would.

Kazuhiko and Mihoshi exit for the kitchen.

Washu leans back against Grandfather.

WASHU
It looks like one more contender is dropping out of the race for third
wife.

GRANDFATHER
She may love Tenchi, but she was never in the race to be his wife.
I wonder what she is going to do about Kazuhiko.

WASHU
That is funny.

GRANDFATHER
What?

WASHU
I have been wondering what you are going to do about me.

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm, I see.

INT. Master bedroom - DAY (Monday, 27 April 1998; 25th Day, 2nd Month)

Ryoko, Tenchi, and Ayeka lie sleeping in the bed.

Ryoko to Tenchi's right and Ayeka to his left.

Sasami enters the room.

She moves the desk chair to the foot of the bed and sits down.

Ryoko opens her eyes.

RYOKO
Forgive me Sasami.

Sasami looks at her but does not respond.

RYOKO
Please.

SASAMI
It will cost you.

RYOKO
I love him Sasami.  No matter what he may decide I will still love him.

SASAMI
I want you to help me change his mind.  He still sees me as a little girl.

RYOKO
And your sister?

SASAMI
I will take care of Ayeka.  Isn't that right Ayeka?

Ayeka opens her eyes.

AYEKA
I am not happy about it.  I will do what you ask.

Ayeka gets out of bed.

She walks around Sasami and over to Ryoko's side.

Ayeka holds her hand out to Ryoko.

Ryoko takes Ayeka's hand and gets out of bed.

Both of them leave the room.

INT. Dining room - DAY

Washu and Grandfather sit next to each other at the table.

Ayeka and Ryoko walk in.

They sit opposite of Washu and Grandfather.

RYOKO
Who's cooking?

GRANDFATHER
Mihoshi and Kazuhiko.

Ryoko nods her head.

RYOKO
What is wrong with our link?

WASHU
Sasami cut it last night.  I could do nothing but feel your pain after
the explosion.  She said it was temporary.

RYOKO
What happened after the explosion?

WASHU
You will have to ask Mihoshi.  She is the one that rescued all of you.

AYEKA
I would like to know what weapon they used that shot me through my shield.

WASHU
That I can answer.  It was a Chisaioto neuro weapon.  It was designed
to defeat the Power of Jurai.

Ayeka holds her hand to her mouth as her face shows shock.

AYEKA
The Jurai counsel needs to know about this.

WASHU
I don't know if Mihoshi sent in her report yet.

Ryo-Ohki, Kazuhiko and Mihoshi walk out with the food.

KAZUHIKO
Where are Tenchi and Sasami?

RYOKO
They are having a discussion.

AYEKA
They have to resolve certain issues.

Grandfather nods his head.

MIHOSHI
That is so sweet.

Ryoko and Ayeka glare at Mihoshi.

Mihoshi ignores them and serves breakfast.

INT. Master bedroom - DAY

Tenchi opens his eyes.

SASAMI
Good morning Tenchi.

TENCHI
Good morning Sasami.  Where are Ayeka and Ryoko?

SASAMI
I sent them down to breakfast.

Tenchi's eyes go wide.

TENCHI
Sasami your marks...  They...  Well...

SASAMI
I am a child no more.  I will never get my childhood back now.  I will
not allow you to continue to treat me as a child.  Do you understand
Tenchi?

TENCHI
I apologize, Ms. Sasami.

SASAMI
And if you keep that up I will kick your ass from one end of the ship
to the other end.  Do you understand that, Tenchi?

Tenchi turns red.

TENCHI
Yes Sasami I understand.

Tenchi gets out of bed.

He walks over to Sasami and kneels beside her.

TENCHI
Are you okay Sasami?

SASAMI
No, I am not okay.  Too much has happened to me in the last two days.

TENCHI
Can you tell me what is bothering you.

SASAMI
I would prefer to tell everyone at one time, but I am not ready yet.
There is too much going on in my mind right now.

Tenchi takes Sasami's hand and stands.

TENCHI
I do love you Sasami.  I am sorry but your appearance still stands
between us.  Society would not accept us yet.

SASAMI
Have you even considered marrying me?

TENCHI
You are the only one who could be my third wife.  We just need more time.

SASAMI
I don't care what society or anyone else thinks about us being together.

Tenchi hugs Sasami.
 
TENCHI
Does it matter what I think?

Sasami looks up at Tenchi's face.

Tears form in her eyes.

TENCHI
Please Sasami.  My heart is torn now.  There is too much confusion in
my mind.

SASAMI
I have these feelings inside that I never experienced before.  You are
the only man I have ever known outside my family.  You will be the only
man I ever will know.

TENCHI
Will you accept a betrothal now for a marriage in the future?

SASAMI
How far in the future?

TENCHI
You are what right now?  About fifteen physically?

SASAMI
Physically I turned sixteen last February.

TENCHI
Let's wait a year.  If you still feel the same way about me then we can
make wedding plans.

SASAMI
Will you still love me in a year?

TENCHI
I have told you before; I will always love you Sasami.  I will love you
if you want me for a friend, brother, or husband.

SASAMI
You must have your two wives permission before you can ask me about an
engagement.

TENCHI
Fine.  Let's join them for breakfast. 

Together they leave the room.

INT. Dining room - DAY

Washu, Grandfather, Ryoko, Ayeka, Ryo-Ohki, Mihoshi, and Kazuhiko sit
eating breakfast.

Sasami and Tenchi walk in.

Tenchi sits at the head of the table and Sasami sits next to him.

TENCHI
Ayeka, Ryoko, I must ask you something.

Both look at Tenchi.

TENCHI
I would like a betrothal between Sasami and me.  May I have your
permission to court her?

AYEKA
Sister wife, do you think our husband is worthy of Sasami?

RYOKO
That is a very good question sister wife.  Tenchi will you be able to
care for her as fits her station in life?

TENCHI
Yes, I shall provide for her.

AYEKA
Do you love her Tenchi?

TENCHI
Yes Ayeka.  I love her deeply.

RYOKO
Are you concerned about her age?

TENCHI
Yes.  I would like to wait at least one year before we make any plans
for a wedding.

AYEKA
What will become of us?

TENCHI
I love you both.  I have enough love to share with three women.  You
will always be my wives.

RYOKO
Sasami, will you accept the position of third wife?

SASAMI
Yes.

AYEKA
She is my blood sister.  I will not question her.

RYOKO
We have no objection Tenchi.  You may court Sasami.  You must treat her
with the respect she deserves.

TENCHI
Thank you both.  Sasami may I court you with the intent of making you
my third wife.

SASAMI
Yes Tenchi, I will enjoy it while you try to win my heart.

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
I had less time than I thought Grandfather.

Washu looks at Grandfather.

WASHU
Less time for what?

GRANDFATHER
Before his third bachelor party.

WASHU
Oh is that it.

Grandfather looks down at his hands.

GRANDFATHER
What else could it be?

Kazuhiko reaches out and touches Mihoshi.

KAZUHIKO
Ah.  Mihoshi would you mind being my girlfriend?

MIHOSHI
I am your friend Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
I would like to take you out when we get back to Earth.  I would like
to get to know you better.

MIHOSHI
I would enjoy that.  There is so much on Earth that I would like to see.

Mihoshi reaches out and touches Kazuhiko's cheek.

MIHOSHI
There is much about me that you may not want to know.

KAZUHIKO
I understand.  I don't want to pry in your past, but I would like to
look into your future.

TENCHI
Let's head home.

Mihoshi looks at Washu.

MIHOSHI
Are you ready to go Ms. Washu?

WASHU
I will need two more days to make sure there is nothing left on the
planet.

Tenchi looks at Washu.

WASHU
I am gathering up all the weapons that were used against you, and I am
looking for any more of Shihou's men.

TENCHI
Where are Ryoe and Daijiro?

MIHOSHI
They are still in their room.  They are okay.  Just need a little time
together.

Tenchi nods his head.

TENCHI
Are you sure?  A lot has happened to them.

MIHOSHI
Yes I am sure.  I talked to Ryoe myself.  We like to talk sometimes.

TENCHI
Fine then.  Let us know when you are finished Little Washu and we will
head for Earth.  I am ready to go home.

Sasami smiles and stands.

SASAMI
Well sisters.  I lay claim to Mondays and Thursdays.

TENCHI
We are not married yet!

SASAMI
I know that.  I just want you to have your chance to win my heart.

RYOKO
Fine by me.  I will take Wednesdays and Saturdays.

AYEKA
Okay.  Tuesdays, and Fridays for me then.

TENCHI
I can't believe you are agreeing to this.

RYOKO
I know when not to fight Tenchi.  This is definitely not a time to fight.

AYEKA
I know you will do the right thing with Sasami.  She is my sister but she
isn't little any more.  I hope she learns life's lessons the easy way.

SASAMI
See Tenchi, it will all work out.  I am tired all ready Tenchi.  You can
tell me a story while I go to sleep.

Sasami takes Tenchi's hand and leads him from the room.

MIHOSHI
I thought I was the only one to get sleepy when it was still morning.

Everyone breaks down in laughter.

FADE OUT:

THE END
