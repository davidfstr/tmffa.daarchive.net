	Deep in the heart of the Antaxia Nebula, there was an odd occurrence going 
on, specifically located aboard the Tildrin Space Station.  On this particular 
day by means beyond normal sentient understanding, four beings that were drawn 
together by a bizarre thing called love, were standing face to face.  Two of the 
occupants had dangerously raised weapons at the other two occupants in mistaking 
them for intruders.  So far, not one of the individuals involved had said a 
thing.  "Tenchi...what are you doing 
here?"  Kiyone was the first to break the silence and lowered her gun.  This was 
not the way Tenchi had wanted to start things off but oh well.  "I...I came to 
see you...there was a few things I wanted to say to you" Tenchi walked over to 
Kiyone, only glancing nervously at Vin-Roc and whispered to Kiyone "Can we go 
outside and talk?"  "Sure...let's go" The two walked out the complex and began 
walking off into town.  

	(You can lower that buddy...she's not going anywhere)  Vin-Roc lowered his 
hand and powered down, feeling very foolish for having aimed at Ryoko for so 
long.  There was still an awkward silence, neither he nor Ryoko said a thing, 
they were still in shock over the fact that they were both very well alive.  
This was just so unreal for him, he thought he was dreaming and had to know if 
it was real...so he walked over and kissed her...she didn't refuse him.  After a 
few minutes, their lips parted, and Ryoko slapped him 
across the face with quite a bit of authority.  "Damn you!"  She managed to get 
out.  "Well...it's good to see you too...ow...what was that for?"   Vin-Roc 
responded, still rubbing his face.  "All these years...all this time...why 
didn't you come looking for me?"  "I'd ask the same of you but we both know the 
answer to that...Ryoko, you and I both thought the other was dead from the 
ambush.  How was I to know you were still alive...there was no trace, no hint, 
no clues.nothing"  

	Ryoko's expression became a bit less jaded and showed some remorse for 
striking him.  "Tell you what, why don't we sit down and talk.  I have 
a feeling a lot has happened since that time.  Please, let's just try to catch 
up, okay?" She nodded "Well...all right...I didn't come all this way for nothing 
you know" Vin-Roc motioned for Ryoko to have a seat while he went 
about getting some drinks.  He sat across form her and decided to start the 
conversation "Why don't we start off with this Tenchi character...he must be 
someone very special to have this much attention around him" 
"Tenchi...well...with him there's a long story for you."

*****************************************************************************

	For some time, both Tenchi and Kiyone walked through the streets of 
Tildrin, both glancing occasionally at the other only to shy away just as 
quickly.  Kiyone really wasn't too sure what he was up to but didn't like being 
in suspense for too long.  Tenchi was trying hard to think of what to say.  
(Well genius, you got all the way here and now you have your chance to talk to 
her...so say something!!!)  "Kiyone...wait" He motioned for her to take a seat 
on a nearby bench.  "Look Kiyone, I am really sorry for making you cry.  I 
shouldn't have been so selfish to let you leave like that" Kiyone shook her head  
"Tenchi...I told you, it's okay.  I'm just happy to have told you how I felt 
about you and..." Tenchi held up a hand and interrupted her.  "But it isn't okay 
Kiyone.you're the second person I let slip away from 
me.and I never tried to stop you.  I've always been too afraid to take a chance, 
and I guess I've been using Sakuya as a reason for not wanting to take that kind 
of chance again.  I've been a fool and a coward.  I was too stubborn to let my 
heart have a shot at running things.  But I want that to stop...now" 

	Tenchi reached over and grabbed Kiyones' hands and held them firmly.  Her 
pulse shot up and she felt hot all over.  (Oh my gosh...Tenchi...are you saying 
what I think you're saying.. oh please...please...answer my prayer...please 
Tenchi!)  "Kiyone, what I'm trying to say is that...I want you to come back with 
me.  I really do want to give it a shot between you and me.  Please...will you 
come back...will you answer my prayer?"  Kiyone felt the ground beneath her fall 
away and she felt light headed.  (I can't believe he prayed for this...for 
me...oh why did it have to take this long?)  "Well...will you come back?"  

	Kiyone could hold back her tears no longer, they both stood up and Kiyone 
jumped into his arms.  "You didn't need to ask me twice silly..." The tears 
streamed down her eyes and they kissed.  They finally ended their kiss and 
Tenchi reminded her "We should be getting back, I need to tell Ryoko that we're 
leaving" Kiyone nodded and took his hand and they headed back to the complex.  
Little did Kiyone know it, but she had discovered one of 
the universes' most valued prize...and it's name was Tenchi Masaki.                
*****************************************************************************

	Back at the complex, both Vin-Roc and Ryoko were comparing notes on their 
exploits across the universe and she explained more of Tenchi to him along the 
way.  "Well...you certainly did have one hell of a romp around the stars 
Ryoko..."  "Well, from what you told me...you weren't exactly quiet 
yourself...number one on the bounty hunters list I heard"  He glanced away from 
her and took a long swig of his drink "Yeah, eventually I get a little action 
here and there, I sometimes let them catch up to me, the bounty's so big on my 
head the last I checked, I just might consider turning myself in!" 
	Ryoko took humor from this and let out a loud laugh.  "I miss that laugh 
of yours...you always would find some humor in my weak jokes"  "They weren't all 
that bad" she said sympathetically.  There was silence then as both pirate and 
soldier looked each other in the eyes, trying to figure out if there was still 
something worth salvaging of their past.  "Vin...there's something I need to 
know...something I waited three hundred years and a few 
million miles across space to find out"  "I...if you knew...if you even had the 
slightest notion that I was still alive..." He knew what she was getting at and 
leaned closer to her and took her hand and spoke firmly "Know this Ryoko, if I 
knew for a moment you were still alive...no force in the universe would have 
stopped me from finding you" The tear that fell from her eye was caught in his 
hand before it could hit the floor.  

	"Then, then come back with me, please...I know we can make it work again" 
She tightened her grip on his hand.  He looked at her, saw her yearning to have 
him back...and he shook his head.  He let go of her hand "...why...?" She begged 
to know. "You know why...we may be together...but then we'll both be on the 
run...what kind of a life is that?" She shook her head and looked more 
determined to convince him "I don't care..." the pirate replied.  The tears 
started falling faster now as Ryoko tried desperately to change his mind.  "I 
don't care if we have to go across the universe and 
back...as long as its' with you, doesn't that mean anything to you?"  He got up 
and looked her in her eyes, which were drowning in tears "Of course it 
does...but I can't...not right now." He turned from her, too ashamed to face 
her.  "Vin...please" she begged him.  "I'm sorry..."

	A moment later, Tenchi and Kiyone came in, hand in hand and all smiles.  
Tenchi saw the look on both Vin-Roc and Ryoko and knew they didn't have the same 
success that they had.  "Ryoko?"  Tenchi looked the pirate straight, but she 
turned away to hide her tears.  "I'm leaving Tenchi...right now." She turned to 
face Vin-Roc "There's nothing here for me anymore..." With that, she walked out 
and began heading back for the spaceport.  

	"I guess we should go too Tenchi..." He nodded and they began for the 
door, when a heavy hand came down on Tenchi's shoulder.  "Do me a favor would 
you, watch after her...she's a good woman really...but you already knew that 
didn't you?"  He nodded and respectfully shook his hand which dwarfed his own.  
"Maybe sometime we can get a few drinks.  From what Ryoko tells me, you're one 
tough guy, but you're also a good man.  I respect that" Tenchi nodded and he and 
his new girlfriend left the complex leaving Vin-Roc alone. He turned and headed 
towards the window and stared out into the city, towards nowhere in particular.

	At the spaceport, Kiyone had already boarded the Yugami and had put in the 
coordinates to head back to Earth.  "Tenchi...let's go."  "I'm right behind you 
Kiyone" Tenchi stayed a few minutes to console Ryoko.  "I'm really sorry things 
didn't go well between you two" Ryoko cleared her eyes and 
sniffed "Well...at least I saw him one last time..." Tenchi put his hands on her 
shoulders and looked her in the eyes  "Will you be coming back with us, I 
wouldn't want you to go off and so anything crazy" Ryoko appreciated the offer 
"Yeah...I guess I'll be coming back...I'd probably wander around heading nowhere 
right about now"  "Great, we'll see you there!"  Tenchi boarded the ramp and 
entered the Yugami, which took off shortly afterward.  
	
	(What was I thinking coming back here...ah the hell with it.  I gotta get 
back) Ryoko began to board the ramp back to her ship when she felt his presence.  
"What do you want?"  was all she managed to get out rather coldly.  "...there's 
something I need you to know...just listen.  Now that I 
know for sure that you're still alive, my life won't be the same.  I didn't want 
it to end like this...too fast"  He took a few steps closer to her and reached 
out to take her hands.  At first she refused, but then she gave 
in.  "Ryoko...I promise you this...when all of this is over...I'll come back for 
you...I swear it...just believe in me till then" Ryoko tried to fight back the 
tear for him "I'm going to hold you to that promise soldier...don't you let me 
down" With that, she turned and headed up the ramp and boarded her ship.  She 
put in the coordinates for Earth and set engines at full power.  Ryoko glanced 
one last time out the cockpit window and saw him simply standing there, looking 
back at her.  "Don't you let me go on again...alone" The ship sped off.

	Back on the station, Vin-Roc was walking back towards the complex with 
another drink in his hands.  (What am I doing...I let her go...she came all this 
way...just to see me...and I just let her go...and I may never see her again)  
His head sank low and he went for another swig.  He looked at the bottle in his 
hand and remembered what Kiyone had said to him about running from his past. 
"....ENOUGH!!!"  he shouted and threw the bottle against a wall and as it 
smashed he knew what had to be done if this game was ever going to end.  "It's 
time...time to go home."

	After an hour or so of preparations, Vin-Roc readied himself for what he 
knew would possibly be his last mission.the annihilation of the Imperial 
Council.  (It has to be done...not just for my sake...but also for my people's 
sake...they must be set free from their tyranny.  I must try at the very least, 
I cannot accept this fate...and die a traitor)  "I cannot accept this!"  Against 
a dark backdrop...with the entire city asleep...he tapped a few buttons on the 
console he had attached to his arm.  Hovering outside the orbit of a nearby 
asteroid, a cloaked ship, his ship, came to life and approached the station to 
pick up its only occupant on what was sure to be a suicide mission.  

	His console beeped to inform him that his ship was hovering overhead and 
ready for him.  He cleared his thoughts and focused on two objectives...take out 
the council...and if possible...keep his promise to Ryoko.  With that done, he 
tapped another button and was transported to his ship, which immediately 
departed with its destination...Alcaron.  

*****************************************************************************

	     Very few creatures had the privilege to be in the room at hand.  Many 
spoke of its interior and what went about behind its colossal doors.  Of the 
debates regarding one of the most powerful and influential civilizations in 
existence.  In this room there was but one pedestal, which was supported by 
massive beams of energy.  This room was housed in a complex larger in size than 
many palaces and was regarded much more than just a board of meeting.  But it 
was the occupants of this room that made many silent just uttering their title.  

	The Imperial Council consisted of five of the most powerful and 
intelligent beings on the planet known as Alcaron.  True, to many they would 
appear as rather elderly men...but to those who were foolish enough to challenge 
their authority, they were messengers of death, each member 
more deadlier than the other.  They were coming to an end of a lengthy debate 
over the issue regarding taxing the commoners which would soon come to pass. 

	"So, it is agreed than...the commoners will be double taxed.  By doing so 
this will quell any talk of rebellion and overthrow these pesky upstarts speak 
so openly of amongst one another" The first and most powerful councilman spoke 
with dignity and grace, and cold heartedness.  "Yes...it is agreed...are there 
any opposed?"  None would disagree with the notion.  "So 
be it...this will conclude our discussion for today, but now what is this?"  
	A messenger appeared before them holding an insto-gram in his hands. "Good 
councilmen, please forgive my intrusion, this message has just arrived for you" 
He passed the message onto a platform, which levitated up towards the 
councilman.  "Well...shall we see what this crude interruption is about?" 

	Tapping the button on the insto-gram, a holographic recording of Vin-Roc 
appeared before them.  The message spoke "Well, good day councilmen, I just 
thought I would send my regards and let you know how much I truly appreciate all 
the bounty hunters you have sent looking for me.  I must say they did provide me 
with a good amount of practice and exercise.  I simply wish to let you know that 
it will no longer be necessary to come looking for me.  For very soon, io shall 
soon be upon you...very soon indeed.  Till then, enjoy your exploitations of 
Alcaron...for those days...are numbered!"  With that, the image faded away.  

	A look of both terror and hatred appeared across all their faces...save 
one.  The first councilman appeared very calm about the situation.  "We must 
prepare!"  "Yes, yes we must double, no triple our 
defenses!!"  "We must leave this place immediately!"  The clamor from the other 
councilmen was almost deafening.  The first councilman drew his attention to the 
individual below, charged his had with power, and obliterated the messenger for 
delivering such troublesome news.  

	This caught the attention of the other 
councilmen who ceased their bickering and turned to him.  "My good 
councilmen...have you forgotten just who we are?"  "We are members of the most 
feared and respected group this side of the Creator himself." 
He continued,  "He is but one...and we are five...and five powerful ones 
indeed!"  "I shall tell you what preparations we shall undergo for our guest 
soon to be..."  He smiled a devious grin "Yes...please tell us" The fourth 
member spoke.  "Tell us and we shall do without hesitation!"  The fifth one 
pleaded.  "Oh...I shall indeed tell you what it is we shall do...we shall do..." 
All other councilmen were fixed solely on his next words.  

	"Nothing...or rather...we shall do all that we can to see to his arriving 
here to see us"  "Are you mad?" was one response.  "Surely you jest yes?"  was 
another.  "Call for a doctor...he has gone ill!"  "Silence all of you!!!"  Again 
they ceased speaking.  "We will let him come to us...and then when he does." He 
leaned forward facing them all with but his face in the light.  "We shall be rid 
of this nuisance once...and for all"  "Then it is 
agreed...we shall let him in" spoke the second.  "We shall provide no resistance 
to him" spoke the third.  "We will await his arrival" spoke the fourth.  "And 
when he does..." spoke the fifth.  "HE SHALL BE NO MORE!!"  They spoke in 
unison.  With that, the lights were dimmed and a cleaning crew was sent in to 
remove the remnants of the unfortunate messenger.  That day the twin suns set 
for the last time before the final conflict would occur.
