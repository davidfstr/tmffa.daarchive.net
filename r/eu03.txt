<Opening Theme: MiB Ending Music (Here Come The Men In Black)>

(SCENE: It's been two weeks since the trio first haunted the poor
Masaki family. The breeders have been cleaned up, very few bipeds
roamed the forest, and the only aliens remaining at half strength were
the persistent Sectoids. The transport sits in it's normal place, in
all it's repaired glory.)

[TENCHI]: Well, sorry to see you two go...

<Shik and Razz stand, packed up and loading the transport with their
stuff>

[SHIKAERU]: Yeah, well... It was fun while it lasted... Thanks's for
showing us some hospitality and letting us camp outside've your house!
[RAZZIER]: Yes. That was really kind of you folks.
[TENCHI]: Ah, it was nothing.. <Under his breath> Sorta..
[ARASHI]: Hey did you say "two"? Don't forget me! <Dragging his pack
with him>
[RAZZIER]: Ah ah! I don't think so Arashi. There's still a few
overlords and Sectoids out there, and we owe it to these folks to get
rid of ALL of them.
[ARASHI]: <Eyes the size of basketballs> WHAT?!!!
[RAZZIER]: You be careful, alright?
[ARASHI]: WHAAA?!!!!!!!!!!!
[SHIKAERU]: Yeah, and watch over the civilians huh? Make sure no
kidnappings happen or it'll be your ass! <Shuts the hatch, and the
Transport's engines whir to life>
<The transport takes off vertically and swoops into the sky, leaving a
shocked and left-out Arashi behind>
[TENCHI]: <Patting Arashi on the back> Don't feel bad. I don't think
those two are going to have any more fun reporting to your "General
Mason" either.
[ARASHI]: General Mason? We don't have a General Mason!! <Eyes huge now>
[SASAMI]: Are you ok Mr. Arashi?
[TENCHI]: Hooo boy.

<Arashi's eye twitches a little>
<Everyone covers their ears>

[ARASHI]: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<Scream echoes>

<Echo- Zoom out to map view of Japan>
<Echo- Zoom out to satellite view>
<Echo- Full world view>

--------------

(Meanwhile: A small, but important war rages on in the not-so-distant
cosmos...)

(Scene: The 17th Terran Battlefleet [Consisting of 2 carriers, 6
battleships, and 3 frigates] tries their luck against the hulking
dreadnaught...)

(Ships dart to and fro, some getting fried into non-existance, some
continuing to fight valiantly, and inside those ships, some crew
members rush about, and some crew members float in the cold airless
depths of space...)

(Suddenly a handful of jet black fighters that survived the initial
onslaught swoops from their hiding place among the asteroids.)

[SQUAD LEADER]: All fighters, turn off your running lights. We'll try
this one with some pirate methods.

(The blinking lights mounted on the fighters's wings shut off, leaving
only the reflections of the beam-fire to reveal the silent death that
approached the henchmen aboard the larger ship.)

--------------

(SCENE: Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko stand around a forlorn looking Arashi)

[TENCHI]: Why are you so glum?
[ARASHI]: They abandoned me! They're probably down in the Carribbeans
drinking from coconuts while I'm up here hunting aliens and
terrorising you poor folks...
[RYOKO]: Oh come on! It's not that bad here!
[ARASHI]: Well...
[AYEKA]: Besides, I think all of us feel safer with you hunting the
aliens than those other two.
[TENCHI]: I agree fully... Shikaeru was a bit wild with that flame
thrower..
[ARASHI]: <Frowns and looks down at his X-COM chest symbol>

<The group looks at Arashi for a moment>

[RYOKO]: Yoo hoo... Are you there?
[TENCHI]: Oh no... I think he's going to snap again...
[ARASHI]: This is what X-COM has become!!.... <Gets a pained
expression before tearing every symbol of X-COM off his armor>
................ I quit.
[ALL]: YOU WHAT?!!!
[TENCHI]: What about those aliens?!!!
[AYEKA]: What about your duty?!!!
[RYOKO]: What about those dresses that Razz stole from me?!!!!
[ARASHI]: ... I said I quit. That's all there is to it... <Looks down
before walking away from the household>
[TENCHI]: Something is definitely wrong... What's gotten into him?
[AYEKA]: Yes... Before all this he was a very good soldier!
[RYOKO]: Now he seems to be good at pissing and moaning...

<The group turn their heads in time to watch Arashi leave>
<Uncomfortable silence>

[TENCHI]: Oh well that's that! I think dinner is-
[SASAMI]: <Peeking through the door> Dinner's ready!!
[TENCHI]: Er, well let's go!

-------------------

Two days later......

-------------------

6:22 PM Masaki Household
After dinner...

(SCENE: The Masaki family sits on the couches in one of their rare
family gatherings)

<General chatter ensues for a moment>

[SEION]: Hey we still got those aliens living in the forest.. What are
we gonna do about them?
[KIYONE]: Well, kill them of course!
[SEION]: Yeah, but how will we find them?
[WASHU]: I can help with that! <Begins typing up blueprints for
something>
[SEION]: Alright.
[TENCHI]: Now... How do we kill them?
[AYEKA&RYOKO]: We could feed them some of Ryoko's/Ayeka's food!
[WASHU]: <Skeptical expression> I highly doubt they'll fall for -that-
again... Remember, they're not stupid beasts with tiny brains!...

They're probably making a plan right now as we are!

--------------------

(SCENE: Forest clearing: An overlord-alien with an amazingly small
cranium sits, his upper jaw over lapping his lower. It is surrounded
by Sectoids who listen intensely)

[OVERLORD]: DUHHH HUH! <Looks down the barrel of his plasma rifle and
pats the stock of it>
[SECTOID]: Merp! <Blinks incredulously> <Chatters noisily to the
Sectoid next to him who nods in agreement>
[OVERLORD]: Durrr... <Pulls back the action on the plasma rifle>
[SECTOID 2]: <Chatters with his comrade again>
[OVERLORD]: ERRR HUH!!! <Throws the plasma rifle in the air> <The
plasma rifle spins and lands on it's "butt" discharging a plasma round
right into the apricot head of the Overlord, who lands, a steaming
heap showing the quality of the alien leaders>

[SECTOIDS(ALL)]: <Chatter amongst themselves and casually scurry away>

--------------------

(Back to the Masaki family)

[TENCHI]: You're right Washu-chan... Let's get to work!

<Everyone nods in agreement>

<Theme: FF7: Sarani>

<Time acceleration: X4>

<Seion and Tenchi go over some plans, both scurry off and show the
plans to Washu who begins to type furiously>
<Kiyone and Mihoshi begin sticking motion detectors along the rims of
the roof>
<Ryoko and Ayeka stand over a wire-mesh fence, arguing for a moment
before picking it up and lacing it around the house>
<Tenchi and Seion are seen building a small tower, wood chips and such
flying around in a flurry>
<Washu scurries up the tower's ladder and puts a high-tech looking
spotlight together>
<Sasami runs around cutely, tending to the exaughsted workers>

<End Time acceleration>

(SCENE: The Masaki family stands outside their new fence, panting and
looking at their work)

[TENCHI]: Well <Pant> I'd like to- <Pant> See them- <Pant> get to our
house now!
[RYOKO]: Yeah <Pant> I'll bet <Pant> We built <Pant> the best security
system <Pant> EVER!!

<The family stands in silence except for their breathing>

[SEION]: So, how about some Karaoke?

---------------

<The two cars skid to a halt, and the Masaki family piles out of them,
everyone paired up with their 'partner'>

<A length of time passes... It is now midnight...>

---------------

[DARK OFFICER]: Approaching destination.
[NA'TIROSS]: Once over the target, deaccelerate and begin decent.
[DARK OFFICER]: Yes my lord.
[GHAL]: I can hardly wait...!
[NA'TIROSS]: No fighting will be done here or today my brash friend...
We must 'setup' things first........

---------------

(SCENE: The huge starship slowly begins hovering over the Masaki
household... The ground begins to shake with the massive vibrations of
the ship's reactor and thrusters...)

[TENCHI]: <Waking up abruptly> What is that!?!
[RYOKO]: Is it an earthquake?!!
[AYEKA]: Oh Kami-sama!! Look!!! LOOK!!! <Points out the window at the
starship>
[TENCHI]: It's... It's.... HUMONGOUS!!

[NA'TIROSS]: <Over the psionic plain> ... Hear me out... You will all
comply with my wishes, or be vaporized where you lay...

[TENCHI]: Who- Who are you?!!
[SEION]: <From down the hall> Hey what the hell is going on!!

[NA'TIROSS]: I, am Na'Tiross... And you all, are now mine to do with
as I wish............

[AYEKA]: Oh my god!! OH MY GOD!! RAPE!!! RAAAPE!!!!
[RYOKO]: <Putting her hand over Ayeka's mouth> SHH! Don't give him any
ideas!!!

[NA'TIROSS]: Stand outside. You all have a minute to comply.

[TENCHI]: I think we'd better do as he says...
[RYOKO]: Heh, why? We don't even know if he has any weapons.

<A dark blue beam jets down and turns a small patch of fresh, fertile
roses into a smoking, barren pit about 12 feet deep>

[RYOKO]: Ok lets go.

<The Masaki family slowly proceeds outside, standing on the lawn, some
of them wondering why they don't just go up and blast the thing to bits>

[TENCHI]: Ok fine. We're here.

[NA'TIROSS]: GOOOOOOOD... Now I have you all in one spot... So many
birds, with just one stone............... <A yellow orb of energy
gathers on the same gun battery that obliterated the Yuukan Na>

<The Masaki family stands with shocked expressions>

[SASAMI]: <Cries uncontrollably> They- they can't! What did we ever do?!
[MIHOSHI]: <Whimpers a little before breaking out into full water
works and holding onto Sasami>

<Theme: The Last Star Fighter>

<Suddenly a new sound is heard, a low whirring sound, like the old
transport, except much louder... After a moment, the sound of heavy
hydrolics thudding around is heard, afterwards followed by a cranking
noise>

<Camera change: Arashi is seen seated in a very large,
high-tech-artillery-piece>

[ARASHI]: Not so fast!!!!! This is X-COM Operative Arashi Tokay!!! In
my eyes, you are currently invading the planet of Terra!!! You have 20
seconds to leave the atmosphere or I will open fire!!!!

[NA'TIROSS]: You, of all beings, dare to threaten-

<The artillery piece hums for a moment, out rumbling even the ship's
engines. Suddenly a blood red beam flashes intensely and drills a hole
straight through the starboard side of the monstrous ship, and also
'vaping' the gunnery battery>

[NA'TIROSS]: <Turns to the helmsman> GET US OUT OF HERE!!!

<The starship rumbles and raises into the sky at top speed>

[ARASHI]: WOOOOO!! YEAH HAA!! <Shakes his fist at the fleeing behemoth>
[TENCHI]: You're back!
[RYOKO]: I thought you had left for good!!
[AYEKA]: You even drove away that... That...
[ARASHI]: Antaran dreadnought. Construction line 2261, designation
DFT-3460, equipped with optional stellar converter mount. Powered by a
Destroyer class anti-matter reactor with optional Elerium 115 mineral
fuel. Anti-starfighter defenses include: tachyon pulse batteries, EMP
missile launch bays, and a small Hailstorm class neutronium warhead,
with a Dauntless guidance targetting matrix and a heat resistant
casing, and also-
[AYEKA]: ...... That
[SEION]: He's almost as bad as Washu. Just can't shut up
[WASHU]: AHEM!!
[SEION]: Well you can't!!

<Seion is suddenly hopping around, with a greenish tint to his skin
and also a height adjustment...>

[ARASHI]: <Continues talking about the dreadnought without notice>
[WASHU]: <Fumes> YOU'RE STEALING A KAWAII WASHU TRADEMARK!!!!!

<Arashi stumbles around, his height reduced to about 9 or 10 inches>

[WASHU]: Aww. Water sprites are so KAWAII!... Wouldn't you agree?
<Turns her head to the rest of the group> <Sweatdrops>

Suddenly a piercing yelp emits off screen.

The remaining Sectoids are beginning to pick Sasami off of the ground

[SASAMI]: <Screaming> Tenchi!! Help!!
[TENCHI]: Hang on Sasami!!! <Runs towards the Sectoids>
[AYEKA&RYOKO]: SASAMI!!!!!
[ARASHI]: <Waddles towards his new and huge, ship, flailing his tiny
webbed feet>

Tenchi begins to engage the Sectoids, sweeping them aside with his
bokken while Ayeka and Ryoko hurry forward.

[SASAMI]: Let me go!!! Why are you so mean!!!!
[ARASHI]: Wubba wubba!! <the small water sprite scurries from his ship
with a large, devilish looking cannon>
[TENCHI]: <Turning a moment> ARASHI NO!!!! You might hit Sasami!!!
[ARASHI]: Waa?! <Scurries back into his ship>
[TENCHI]: URGH!! <Swats another Sectoid into a tree> SASAMIII!!!
[SASAMI]: Tenchiii HEEELP!!!!! <A soft white light envelopes Sasami
and the remaining Sectoids> <The light shrinks to a very long, needle
sized streak and disappears into where the warship disappeared>
[ALL]: NO!!!!!!
[TENCHI]: ... Sasami-chan.......

---------------

An hour later

---------------

[TENCHI]: <In obvious rage> Those bastards!! They aren't going to take
her and get away with it!! I'm going after her!!
[ARASHI]: ... I feel responsible for all this... If we hadn't crashed
this wouldn't have happened..... I'm going too
[TENCHI]: The crash wasn't your fault... Nor Shik's or Razzier's...

[ARASHI]: Well... It's not just that. Shortly before the dreadnought
arrived, it traveled to ever X-COM base installation on the planet...
And literally scraped it off the face of the earth. My family lived in
one of those bases...... <Gulps> I was in the local defense station
when it happened... I ran to the station's hangar as fast as I
could... I barely escaped with my own life.

---------------

The day after Arashi left...
6:20 PM

(SCENE: Arashi enters a large hangar, housing many ships. One of them
seems to be extremely unique however. The ship is very large, and is a
glossy dark blue. It's cockpit is easily visible at the front, and
it's fuselage extends into four points. On each of the four points,
sits a thruster/turbine which is used for flight and added
maneuverability. On the very rear of the ship sits two large
anti-matter inversion thrust drives, seperated by the ship's tail.)

[RYUN KASASIGRI]: <looks behind him, hanging onto the side of a very
large starship> Hey Arashi! Say, could you hand me that plasma torch?
[ARASHI]: Sure! <Does as he's told>
[RYUN]: Thanks a bunch! <Goes back to work>
[ARASHI]: Hey... Just what exactly is this thing?
[RYUN]: This, is the new Cloakable transport the R&D boys are toying
with... It's seems fragile, but they say it's got as much firepower as
one of our Destroyers!
[ARASHI]: Nifty... Say, what's- <Klaxons blare in the background>
[BASE COMPUTER]: All personel, evacuate the station. Incoming Antaran
Dreadnought. Stellar Converter detected. Stellar converter status:
Armed and charged.
[RYUN]: Oh man... OH MAN!! Not today!!! Not today!!!!!
[ARASHI]: We haven't got the time to whine!! Into the transport, Techy!!

Ryun Kasasigri and Arashi board the experimental transport..
A very short moment later, the four thrusters of the starship ignite,
propelling it off the hangar floor before rotating so it's thrust is
directed towards the rear of the starship, after which, the large
starship exits the hangar just as the stellar converter rains death
down onto the hapless station...

---------------

Back to present...

---------------

Meanwhile, two fighters approached the orbiting dreadnought unnoticed,
since their cloaking mechanisms are active.
The two initiate a type of docking procedure, but not on the normal
docking plate, and instead, latching onto a bare area of hull...

---------------

[ARASHI]: We traveled to every base on earth, only to find that they
all suffered the same fate as the defense station... My family-
<Chokes>..... My family lived in one of those bases..... They're all
gone now... Mom... Dad... My bro... Even my goddamn little neice!!!!
<Turns away> I have no home anymore... Not even a home world...

Everyone looks a little confused except for Tenchi and Washu.

[TENCHI]: What do you mean? Are you talking about Earth? Or Adytum?
[ARASHI]: ... <Mutters pitifully> Adytum... I left there for a
reason... Raiders... A whole mess of them... They charred the planet
to a radiated rock just hours after I escaped...... I'm a coward for
abandoning my people... I'm a failure for not saving my family...
[TENCHI]: No you-
[ARASHI]: I AM GOD DAMMIT!!!!!! DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!!!!!!!!!!

The whole gang stood in silence. No one said a thing... Everyone knew
that nothing could be said to comfort the broken soldier before them.

---------------

Two days later, the gang is gathered around the large transport which
was borrowed by the now-non-existant X-COM organization...

[WASHU]: I've outfitted your starship with more efficient and powerful
engines, and have also rigged it with a "Mauler" device <Answering the
curious looks around her> (Think of your foes being knocked around
with a big bad anti-matter ugly stick.), in case you get in a jam.
[TENCHI]: Thanks for your help Washu-chan... Everyone... Today's the
day... We're going after that guy to get Sasami-chan back...

Out of volunteering, Ayeka, Ryoko, Tenchi, and obviously, Arashi,
board the starship, which Arashi angrily christened "REVENGE".

On board, Arashi powered the stardrive and began to lift off...

[ARASHI]: ....... <Muttering low and deep> ..... For vengeance...
