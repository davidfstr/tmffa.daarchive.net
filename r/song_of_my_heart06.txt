A chapter a disclaimer... wow big deal!  it's always the same. AIC and Pioneer 
own Tenchi, I still don't, but I'll be sure to notify all of you when I do, I've 
been lookin for the rights to it on e-bay...

A/N-  Thanks for bearing (i do relize i probably spelled that wrong) with my bad 
spelling and grammer...Shin Tenchi Muyo (Tenchi in Tokyo) is my fav. series, I 
don't like the art though.... but I thought the villains were interesting, they 
weren't another escapade with Kagato, they were something new! Well before my 
rambling puts you to sleep on the keyboard, thanks to all of the reviewers. I 
love you guys most! Now on with the story!!

Song of My Heart: He's Evil

Ryoko couldn't believe her own words, she had said Hotsuma... that was the 
stronger song of her heart, but then a thought emerged from the darkness of her 
mind.... Hotsuma, the man she loved, was still evil....
{No... he can't be evil.. Washu must have made a mistake! I talked to him, it 
was just like in space, when we were friends.... but he had turned on me in 
space....} Ryoko's thoughts were interupted by Yugi.
"Your worried about the evil in him.... you change him Ryoko, you will change 
him..... I'm sure you will." with this Yugi left Ryoko alone in her room, with 
her thoughts.
"I can change him...." Ryoko said quietly. "But how... tommorow, I'll spend the 
day with him... and I'll see what I can do." she smiled at that and decided to 
go to sleep.

The next morning after breakfast, Hotsuma and Ryoko went for a walk in the 
woods.
"Its so peacfull out here..." Ryoko sighed happily.
"Hm? yea..... peacefull..." Hotsuma replyed somewhat distant.
"Washu.. she said you still have evil in you... I don't believe her...." Ryoko 
said, trying to get to the point.
"Did she really?" Hotsuma said, not really careing what Washu said.
When they reached a small pond, in a clearing, they both sat down.
"So..." Ryoko said tryuing to think of something to say.
"Yugi told me what you two did yesterday... that's gotta be the most original 
way of deciding who you love I've ever heard..." Hotsuma said grinning.
"Heh.. yea..." Ryoko replyed blushing. "So you know who i chose?"
"Yes, but how will you tell Tenchi?"
"I.. I dunno... I hadn't thought about it..."
"Hm.. that could be a problem."
"Yea.... it could be..."
"You'll find a way to." Hotsuma said as he put his arm around her. "I'm sure you 
will."
{How can he be evil..... I wont believe it...} Ryoko thought.

Back at the house Tenchi was getting ready to go for a walk.
"I'll go with you to keep you company Lord Tenchi!" Ayeka cried.
"Uh.. that's ok Ayeka, but I'd really like to go by myself... I need some alone 
time..." Tenchi said, takeing a step away from Ayeka.
"Oh..." Ayeka rplyed trying to sound as sad as possible.
"sorry Ayeka." Tenchi said as he walked out the door ans twords the woods.

~*~

Ryoko dipped her hand into the pond and brought it up quickly, splashing 
Hotsuma.
"What was that for?!?!" He cried.
"For being you." Ryoko said and giggled, but when she giggled, she quickly 
slapped her hand over her mouth. "Oh God.. I just giggled.. I can't believe I 
just giggled.... I'm the great Sapce Pirate Ryoko! space pirates don't giggle!"
"Hm.. The Great Sapce Pirate Ryoko giggles.. more at eleven." hotsuma said 
teasing Ryoko.
"Cut it out!" Ryoko cried, then kissed him, sweetly.

~*~

Tenchi walked through the woods, then heard talking in the clearing where the 
pond was. It sounded like Ryoko, and soemone else... Hotsuma. Tenchi quietly 
walked twords the clearing staying behind trees so they wouldn't see him,  then 
Tenchi saw something that made him almost colapse in shock.  He saw Ryoko kiss 
Hotsuma.

~*~

Ryoko heard a noise in the bushes, and broke the kiss.
"Hm.. wonder what that is..." she said and got up to investigate, then she saw 
Tenchi. "Oh God Tenchi!" she cried, but Tenchi just ran back to the house, to 
tell everyone what he had seen.
"Tenchi! Wait!! I can explain!" Ryoko cried running after him, but she tripped 
over a root and fell, Hotsuma caught up to her, and helped her up. "Well.... I 
just told Tenchi...." Ryoko said quietly.

~*~

At the house Tenchi had just finished telling everyone what he saw.
"That little hussy!!" Ayeka yelled.
"Aw, Ayeka I think it;s kinda sweet!" Mihoshi said.
"Yea!" Sasami chimed in.
"So you and Washu have known the whole time?" Kiyone said quietly to Yugi.
"Yup." Yugi said simply.
Then Ryoko and Hotsuma walked in.
"Ryoko how could you?!?! Don't you remember waht Washu said?!?!?" Tenchi yelled.
"I can change him Tenchi!" Ryoko yelled back.
"Ryoko he's EVIL!!!"
