CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Boku wa moto Pioneer" by Chisa Yokoyama(with much the same look as

adorable little cabbits.
SCENE:The All Japan Kendo Championship Match for the 17-21 year-olds title pitting the defending

referee gives the siganl to start. They charge at each other.......
KUNO: SHINEI!
TENCHI: HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 33: NO NEED FOR GEISHAS!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The Masaki House two days ago. Tenchi and company are loading up the van for the team's 
trip to Kyoto for the tournament. Well, actually, Tenchi and his admirers aren't helping a damn 
bit because...well, you know why.
RYOKO:(with her arms around him)Tenchi? Tenchi, Tenchi! Why can't we come with you?
AEKA: We don't want you to leave us.(She puts her arms around him)
SASAMI: Will you bring us back something? (She does the same as the other two)
MISAKI: Something adorable? (She hugs all four of them)
SEION:(in a lovestruck girl's voice) He can't get you anything if you don't let go (and he 
embraces them all)
MISAKI: You're lucky you're such a pretty boy. Else I'd be mad right now. Nice long hair. 
Washboard abs. Great pecks. And a really big-
AEKA: Mommy!
MISAKI: Oh! Sorry about that.
SEION: No problem. (to tenchi) Let's go!
GEN: Tenchi! Get the lead out!
ARASHI: So, who's taking the van?
TENCHI: Dad, Grampa, Asaka, Kamadaki and Happo.
HAPPO: WHAT?! I don't wanna hang out with them!
TENCHI: Just pulling leg there Happo. (he starts chuckling)
KEIICHI: Just when did Tenchi develope a sense of humor?
SEION: When he relized that having three girls willing to share their lives with him wasn't so
bad after all. That and he inhaled some nitrous oxcide when we were supping up the Shelby an
hour ago. Get in guys! (Tenchi, Gen, Happo, Keiichi, Arashi pile into Seion's car.) Hey, Arashi,
can you drive?
ARASHI: No.
SEION: THEN GET THE HELL OUTTA THE DRIVER'S SEAT!
(Meanwhile, Kiyone is seeing Noboyuki off)
KIYONE: I'll miss you while you're away.
NOBOYUKI: It'll only be for three days. I'll be back soon. Remember, I'm leaving you in charge 
of the party for Tenchi. What do you have planned? (She whispers in his ear) Oooooo. Sounds like
fun. Well, I'll see you real soon, dear (they kiss)
KAMADAKI: Hurry up, Lord Noboyuki! We gotta get going before-(outta no where Megumi appears)
MEGUMI: Kama-san! Where are you going? Don't leave without saying good bye! Don't you like me?
KAMADAKI: Look, you're a beautifull and charming girl and all but-(She kisses him full on the 
lips and the Jurian Knight passes out.)
MEGUMI:(running off) He said I'm beautiful and charming!! He really, really likes me!
YOSHO: Pick Kamadaki up and lets go.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Kyoto. The Tounament. The last day of competition. Arashi was eliminated in the third 
round. Happo and Keiichi were taken out in the quater-finals. Genwas eliminated by Tenchi in the
Semi-finals. Now it's just Kuno and Tenchi.
GEN: That set up was so rigged! They put me agaist you because they knew I could beat Kuno.
YOSHO: I'll have to agree with you on that one. He does tend to have an fragile ego.
SEION: You seem to know alot about the competitors.
YOSHO: I should. This is my 50th year at this tournament. Looks like I'm up.
ANNOUNCER: And now a Kendo clinic by one of the greatest instructors in Japan and named by the 
Emperor as a National Treasure-Sensei Katsuhito Masaki.
(Tenchi enters)
SEION: Where ya been, Ten?
TENCHI: Gone, Seion.
ARASHI: What did you get for the girls?
TENCHI: Well, I got these for Ryoko and Aeka. (he holds up a Pirates and a Royals baseball
jerseys)I thought they could were them to bed.
SEION: And who's bed would that be?
TENCHI: KNOCK IT OFF!
SEION: What about Sasami and her Mommy?
TENCHI: I got Sasami that Chisa CD she's always wanted. And I got Misaki a Tamaguchi. It'll keep
her from crushing any of us for a while. What did you get Mihoshi?
SEION: I'll tell you when you're older.
GEN: I've been meaning to ask you, Tenchi. Is that Aeka's real hair color?
TENCHI:(sweating artillery shells) Uh, h-how should I know?
SEION: See for your self! Here's some recon photos!
GEN: GAH? Oh baby! Command me my Princess.
SEION: And here's one of Ryoko for you, Arashi.
ARASHI: YEEEEEEEOOWZA! There're huge!
SEION: And one of Nagi for Happo!
HAPPO: (scared) OH MY GOD!(then he looks at the picture and joyfully says) Oh my God.
KEIICHI: You got one of Kiyone for me-(Seion cracks him one) OWWW!
TENCHI: What are you doing with those? I thought you didn't like them!
SEION: I don't. But they still have nice bodies. That and I can use them for blackmail. You want
to see them, don't you Tenchi? (He holds up one of Tsunami)
TENCHI: I uh, (He's just awestruck by Tsunami's beauty but he doesn't get a nosebleed) What I 
wouldn't give for something to interupt this awkward moment.
ANNOUNCER: And now for our final match of the tournament! It's the defending champion Tatawaki
Kuno facing of against, in his first ever tournament, the grandson of the great Katsuhito Masaki
Tenchi Masaki!
TENCHI: That'll do it! Cheer me on!(the scene cuts to Tenchi and Kuno charging at each other
screaming their heads of. It's the same scene from the begining. As they swing at each other,
the screen goes black with two blue slash trails on it. When the scene goes back to normal, we
see Tenchi and Kuno just standing there. Then, just like the block of wood he is, Kuno falls as
if he were a tree and Tenchi was the lumberjack that cut him down in both body and ego.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Masaki House, Kiyone's on the phone.
KIYONE: He won? Really? Yes, it's all ready to go. Just have to get the girls ready. Don't worry
about that. Washu is going to make sure it's authentic. What's that? Oh, I miss you too. I will.
Love you too. Bye-bye.
MIHOSHI: Well?
MISAKI: How are they?
AEKA&RYOKO: Did Lord Tenchi win?
KIYONE: Well.....HE WON!
RYOKO: ALRIGHT! PARTY TIME!
AEKA: I quite agree with Miss Ryoko. What kind of party shall we have?
KIYONE: Does any of you know what a Geishaya is?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: Yosho and Sasami walk into a diner. Seion is behind the counter.
SEION: What can I get you, sweethart?
SASAMI: A Popsi, please!
SEION: Sorry, all we have is Coke.
YOSHO: Now you've done it!
SASAMI:(talking like Joe Peshi) You're sorry? I ordered a Popsi pal!
SEION: Look, I just though-
SASAMI: YOU THOUGHT? WHAT YOU REALLY THOUGH IS THAT I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COKE AND
POPSI!
SEION: NOW LOOK HERE YOU LITTLE BRAT! ALL I GOT'S COKE! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GO AHEAD AND BE 
THIRSTY! SEE IF I CARE!
SASAMI:(like Sammy again)........I'll take a coke then, sir.
YOSHO: I told you that doesn't work on Seion.
SASAMI: (Peshi voice again) Shove it, Grand-pa! (Sammi) I like this place!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: The Masaki House. Ryoko's up on her perch [the rafters] looking down. The rest of the 
are talking to Kiyone.
AEKA: Lord Tenchi in a place like that! I won't allow it! 
RYOKO: She's right! What do those geisha's have that we don't?
NAGI: They're nicer, they're better cooks than you two, they're-
SASAMI: I think Kiyone means that-
AEKA: And where does Noboyuki and that creetin Seion-
KIYONE: What have I told you about calling him that?
AEKA: I'm sorry, Kiyone. Where does Lord Noboyuki and that creetin Seion get off taking him to a
place like that?
RYOKO: Yeah, they've got some nerve doing that to our Tenchi.
MIHOSHI: Our Tenchi?
AEKA: We cannot permit this to happen!
RYOKO: You right, my dear Aeka.
MISAKI: My dear Aeka? What do you mean by that?
RYOKO: LET'S LEVEL THAT GEISHAYA!(the backround goes black and lightning starts flashing. It 
continues for the rest of the characters until Kiyone's next line.)
AEKA: FOR LORD TENCHI'S SAKE!
MISAKI:(with tears in her eyes)IS THERE SOMETHING YOU TWO AREN'T TELLING ME?
SASAMI: WHY DON'T YOU GUYS LET HER FINISH?
MIHOSHI: YOU TWO CAN'T JUST GO AROUND PICKING ON GEISHA GIRLS!
NAGI: YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IDIOTS!
RYO-OKI: MIYA!
KIYONE: KNOCK IT OFF!
THE GIRLS: Sorry.
KIYONE: In case you didn't hear me after I told you what a geishaya was you would've know that
the geishaya they're going to is HERE!
MISAKI: You mean WE get to be the geisha's?
SASAMI: That's right! (with that Washu's door opens)
WASHU: And I'm getting it all ready! But we need it to look authentic so we're going to have to
do something with that hair of yours, girls.
RYOKO: Like what? (the scene switches to a Ryoko with long, strait black hair.) This hair just
isn't me. Look at me! I'm starting to behave and act all nice! This do is really cramping my 
style!
NAGI: You're style? Look at me! (Nagi's hair is black now also. In fact, ALL the girls' hair is.
SASAMI: This is going to be fun!
AEKA: (reading a book on Geisha's) Uh, Sasami? You are to young to take part in this. I'm sorry.
And the same goes for you too, LITTLE Washu.
WASHU: HEY NOW! I..oh...I..(sigh)...I'm going back to my lab where I dispense the quips rather
than absorb them. 
SASAMI:(crying) Can I come with you Washu?
KIYONE: (looking at Aeka) Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I'm going with them. I'll be back. Until then, 
Misaki's in charge. (a sudden look of despair falls over Aeka and Ryoko as Misaki applys one of
her patented embraces on them.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Lab. That's all. Just the Lab. Oh, and Washu, Sasami and Kiyone are in it.
KIYONE: That was kind of a bitchy thing for Aeka to pull.
WASHU: Don't worry about it. I've planned for this eventuallity.
SASAMI: How, Miss Washu?
WASHU: I'll show you! (Washu walks behind a changing screen. When she comes back from behind it
she is the fully grown Washu from OVA 7) They can't say no to me now, can they? (the Little 
Washu puppets appear dressed in full geisha trappings.)
WASHU-A: You're a BABE, Washu!
WASHU-B: The Hottest ever, Washu!
KIYONE: But what about Sasami?
WASHU: She already know's how to solve her problem.
SASAMI: That's right! I forgot about it! I'll see you later! (Sasami runs out of the lab and up
to her room.)
WASHU: And now for Ryo-ohki. By the way, have you seen Ken-oki in the past few days?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Seion's car. In it is the usual gang of idiots. Tenchi is holding up Ken-oki.
TENCHI: You should've let us know you where a stow-away. 
KEN-OKI: CHIAO!
TENCHI: That's no excuse! You're lucky we found you some carrots.
KEN-OKI: Chiao-chiao!
ARASHI: How long before we get back home?
SEION: Another couple of hours! Just relax!
GEN: Hey, Seion? How do you know that your in love with a girl?
HAPPO: When you do stupid stuff to impress her!
SEION: We'd do that anyway. It's when you do stupid stuff to keep her happy.
TENCHI: Like that kitten you got for Mihoshi? (we see a kawaii white kitten with blue eyes and a 
death grip on Seion's face)
SEION: Like the kitten.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Masaki House. The girls are getting ready. There's a knock at the door. Misaki gets 
the door. Standing there is Megumi.
MEGUMI: Uh, Hello Pretty Young Lady. Is Kamadaki home yet? (With that Masaki puts one of her 
patented hugs on Megumi. Megumi returns it in kind.)
MISAKI: WHAT AN ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL! 
MEGUMI: THANK YOU, NICE LADY! (they break the hug.)
MISAKI: No, Sir Kamadaki hasn't returned. He'll be here in a couple of hours. Would you like to 
join us?
MEGUMI: Sure! Sounds like fun!
MISAKI: RYOKO! LITTLE AEKA! Prepare Little Megumi here for the party! (Ryoko and Aeka come out
dressed up as two of the prettiest geisha's that anybody has ever seen)
AEKA: Right this way Miss Megumi.
RYOKO: We'll get you ready in no time. Just leave it to us. I'll do your hair.
ALL BUT RYOKO: NO!
AEKA: I'll take care of Miss Megumi. You go get the sake ready. And try not drink any before the
party.
RYOKO: I can't promise I'll try. But I'll try to try!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Outside the house two hours later. The men folk are going up to house.
TENCHI: I should get some rest. I've got an entrance exam tomorrow.
NOBOYUKI: I don't think you should worry about that.
TENCHI: And why's that? (Tenchi opens the front door)
SEION: Here's why. (The whole house is completely redecorated to look like the inside of a 
Geishaya. All the girls are done up like Geisha's, except for Sasami, who doesn't appear to be 
where.)
TENCHI: I, ya,...oh boy....This is not a good time for this, dad. I have a resposiblity to-
YOSHO: You've been responsible all your life. It's time for you to do something totally
irresposible. Just for tonight. You've earned it.
TENCHI: Well, since you put it that way...
KIYONE: Well come to the Masaki Geishaya, my lords. Do you have a reservation?
NOBOYUKI: Masaki. Party of six.
KIYONE: Very well. I'll let you pick the girl you want to entertain you tonight. As the guest of
honor, Tenchi get to choose two of them. I suggest those two.(she points to Aeka and Ryoko.)
They're our best girls.
TENCHI: I uh...
SEION:(to Tenchi) Don't fight it! Just do it.
TENCHI: Right! I'll take your advice, Miss Kiyone.
KIYONE: Ryoko! Aeka! Please take Lord Tenchi and get him ready. (The three of them leave) And 
how about you, Mister Makibi?
SEION: Is Miss Mihoshi still working here?
MIHOSHI: Yes I am, my dear warrior. Come with me.(She leads him off)
ASAKA: Well, this looks like it might be fun. I'll take the pretty young girl over there.
WASHU: You won't regret this, Lord Knight.
ASAKA: Indeed I shant. (They head off)
KIYONE: And what about you, Kamadake?
KAMADAKE: I don't think I'll-(Insert the Megumi embrace) Uh, I guess I'll be staying after all.
(he walks of with her)
KIYONE: And for you, Lord Noboyuki?
NOBOYUKI:(he looks into her eyes) I've already chosen.
KIYONE: Wise choice. (They head off together.)
KEN-OKI: Chiao? (A humannoid Ryo-oki walks up to him and she picks him up and leaves the room)
YOSHO: Well, it looks like it's just you two that are left, but I think I'll take.......you.
(he walks up to Misaki) Shall we? (As they leave we see Nagi standing there alone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Sasami's room. Sasami is asleep in bed with Tsunami standing beside her.
TSUNAMI: Goodnight, Sasami. (she kisses Sasami on the forehead. And then leaves the room.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Downstairs in the dining room. The gang is gathered around the table. All the menfolk are 
in their feudal Japanese get-ups.
TENCHI: So what did you prepare for dinner?
AEKA: I'm not sure. Sasami said it was a suprise.
RYOKO: Whatever that means.(with that Tsunami enters with dinner and says.....)
TSUNAMI: Suprise.
TENCHI: Uh...heh heh.
TSUNAMI: (in Tenchi's ear) Sasami say's congraduations. 
TENCHI: (he takes out the CD) Here. Give this to her.
TSUNAMI: I'm sure I'll-I mean she'll love it.
RYOKO: Would you like a little sake, Tenchi-chan?
TENCHI: I don't think I'm allowed-
YOSHO: Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
TENCHI: Thank you, Ryoko.
(what follows for the next couple of minutes are scenes of a nice little party. Aeka and Ryoko 
feeding Tenchi, Washu offering Asaka sake, Mihoshi playing with her new kitten, Yosho and Misaki
laughing it up, Megumi with a warm, loving embrace around "Kama-san" and Noboyuki and Kiyone 
kissing. Tenchi, Aeka, and Ryoko seem to drink a little to much sake.)
RYOKO: We want your decision by tonight, Tenchi.
AEKA: We can't wait much longer.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Three hours later. All but Seion, Yosho, Mihoshi, and Misaki have gone upstairs.
TENCHI: That was fun. I gotta get to bed. Well good-night. See you in the morning.
ALL: Goodnight!(Tenchi leaves. He's just a little drunk from all the sake he had)
SEION: So finish your story, my Queen.
MISAKI: Well, anyway, Aeka just shoved this meleodramatic, pink-haired suitor into a mudpuddle.
My lord was he ever annoying! I was just glad that she-(Tenchi comes back down)
TENCHI: Uh, Sempai, can you come up here? (Seion and Tenchi go back upstairs to his room where 
we see Aeka and Ryoko beside Tenchi's bed)
SEION: Yer kidding, right? Here it goes, You take your-
TENCHI: I KNOW THAT! I mean about the two of them! I don't need a fight.I've got that exam
tomorrow! (Seion looks and says...)
SEION: Don't ask me. I've got to get back. It's your choice. (He shoves Tenchi in, shuts the 
door, and leaves.)
TENCHI: (deep breath and a pause.) Alright, girls. You win. I'll say it. I love the two of you
with all my heart and you'll both just have to accept that. Don't make me choose between you
because I just can't.
AEKA: We have already accepted your love for us, my dear Tenchi.
RYOKO: I think we can live with it if you can. Now choose.
TENCHI: So what do you two want me to choose between then? (then it hits him) You don't mean...
AEKA: I'm afraid we do.
RYOKO: I take it you still can't choose between us. (Tenchi prepares for another aurgument) But
I know a way to settle this. (Tenchi prepares for a full blow fight) I'll let Aeka have the 
privledge of having you first. I'll leave you two kids alone for a while. (She kisses Aeka on 
her cheek) Goodnight, Aeka-san. (she walks up to Tenchi and kisses him) Goodnight, my love. And
don't wear youself out. I'll be back a little later to check up on you two. (Ryoko leaves)
TENCHI: Well, were do we start, Aeka? (with that line Aeka begins to remove her kimono and the
screen does as follows....)

TENCHI:In our next Episode I wake up the next morning and miss my exam!
AEKA: You were wonderful last night, Tenchi!
RYOKO: I'll remember it always!
TENCHI: But Seion has something else on his mind.
SEION: It's been a long time, Trakal.
TENCHI: The operative mysteriously returns and reminises old times with Seion and Demi.
TRAKAL: But that mission changed our lives. And her's.
TENCHI: All in Episode 34: No Need For Old Times! 
TRAKAL: It's possitivly worth remembering.

Notes:
	1. I know, I know."What's with Aeka and Ryoko in this story?" They're growing out of their
jelousy over Tenchi. It's more trouble fighting over him than spending time with him. When he 
scolded them a couple Episodes back it finally hit them. They are making an effort to be friends
and, one day, maybe even a sister/wife type relationship. Oh yeah, and they downed a bottle of 
sake along with Tenchi. They're just a little bit uninhibited. But what they say is sincere.
	2. Just who are all these new characters? If you haven't read the first few Eps do so now.

a copy of his picture and his stats.
Seion can be reached at alliemae@mail.earthlink.net. Don't flame me or my fic. If you do you 
will get nuked back.
