=======================================================================

                           --- Tenchi Muyo ---
                          "Sins not Forgotten"

                             - Chapter Two -
                           "Face of the Enemy"

Sasami awoke on the couch in the family room, she yawned and streched to help herself wake 
up faster. "Oh, who left the TV on." she wondered. "Oh well, I guess I'll switch it off 
then start dinner." Sasami picked up the remote from the coffee table pointed it at the 
television and pressed the power button, as she did the whole world suddenly went dark. 
"Ok!" she shouted "I'm sorry if I overslept, but this isn't funny." The little princess 
remained motionless. "Ryo-ohki where are you?" she called to her little friend. "Tenchi." 
she shouted out into the empty house. "Ayeka, Ryoko, anybody."

Sasami fought back her tears as fear filled her heart. "They've left me here alone." she 
sobbed. As she looked down she saw an old straw hat like the ones worn by priests, conical 
in shape with a chin strap to help hold it in place. She reached down and picked it up, as 
she did she realized what was under it. Her eyes widened as she stared at the master key. 
"Tenchi wouldn't just leave this lying around... unless... unless...." Horrible thoughts 
raced through the young girls mind. 'Is Tenchi.... No! He can't be.' she thought to herself.
 
Suddenly an explosion rocked the house. "The lake." she screamed as she raced through the 
kitchen and out the door. The site that greeted her froze her in terror. Her friends and 
family lay scattered about motionless.

Cloaked in darkness a firgure stood amidst the bodies. A blade of green energy formed in 
his hand. Suddenly the figure was in motion, as it rushed toward her it raised it's weapon 
to strike. Sasami stood in terror as the blade descended toward her head. Suddenly the blade
stopped  Sasami glaned about quickly she saw another figure wearing the straw hat and 
holding another sword. The second figures sword was unremarkable to say the least, but he 
had stopped her attacker. 

"Defiler.!" screamed the shadowed figure as he looked at his 
newest opponent. "You'll pay... this is a sin I cannot overlook." The shadowed firgure 
stepped back into another attack position.

Sasami watched in horror as the second figure stepped in to put himself between her and her 
would be attacker. She heard the sound of shattering glass, and she watched as her 
attacker's blade protruded through the back of her would be protector 
"You'll pay for stealing my face..." her attacker said as the second figure slumped to the 
ground. Sasami could only watch frozen with fear, and then she screamed...

Washu sat in her lab, she typed busily at her holo-top computer. When she finished her 
work she closed the terminal and went to look in on Mayuka who was sleeping peacefully 
nearby. Washu walked over to Mayuka's crib. As she stared down at the sleeping child a tear 
ran down her check as she remembered here own son.'Maybe someday...' she thought to herself 
'Maybe someday I 'll try again to...'
 
Alarms and holo-screens erupted around the lab, Washu rushed back to her terminal and 
quickly silenced the alarms.She glanced over to Mayuka who was still sleeping. 
"Whew." sighed the crimson haired genius. 'Now let's see what lit this place up.'  Washu 
typed commands into her holo-top and examined the recently recorded anamoly. 
"That's impossible!.. I think." she said to herself.

Suddenly the lab as well as the house reverberated with the sound of Sasami's scream.Washu 
took a quick glance at Mayuka ,she was still asleep, then exited the lab. As she entered 
the family room she saw Tenchi stting next to Sasami who had her face buried in his chest 
sobbing loudly. Ayeka raced down the stairs. 

"SASAMI !" she shouted 

"She's alright." Tenchi said calmly. 

Ryoko materialized next to the couch "Hey can you guys keep it down." she said 
still suffering from her hangover. Looking around her at the serious expressions on everyone
's face she quickly stated "I don't know what's wrong but I didn't do it honest." 

"Not you silly." chuckled Washu.

Ayeka quickly butted in "Yes, if you had any compassion at all you'd see something has 
upset Sasami." 

"Not now princess!" Ryoko snarled "I'm not in the mood." 

"What's going on in here?" asked Katsuhito as he came in from the kitchen. 

"I think Sasami had a bad dream." Nobuyuki replied as he picked up ice from his recently 
spilled drink. 

"I-it was a nightmare." Sasami said in between sobs. 

"It'll be ok Sasami." Tenchi said softly trying to comfort her.

Katsuhito walked over to the couch followed by Ayeka "Tenchi." He said as he looked down at 
his grandson. "We'll handle things here, you still have your errand to run remember." 

Ryoko's face brightened as she floated over to Tenchi and gently grabbed his arm. 
"Oh Tenchi take me with you, please." she asked sweetly. 

"No your staying here." Washu said as she grabbed Ryoko and pulled her away from Tenchi. 
"I have some data to go over in my lab so you need to watch Mayuka for a while." 

"Ok." Ryoko replied still smiling, she then dissappeared then reappeared a moment later 
gently holding a still sleeping Mayuka in her arms.

"What is this errand exactly?" asked Ayeka as she took Sasami into her arms. 

"As you know." Katsuhito began "I am the priest of the Masaki shrine. As such it is my duty 
from time to time, to lend shelter and knowledge to those who come here. A fellow priest 
has called on me to assist a traveller who has a desire to visit this shrine and some of 
it's surroundings. It would take several days by foot for this person to reach us and with 
a storm approaching I have decided to send Tenchi to aid him in his journey." 

"Well I better get going." Tenchi said as he stood up "I don't want to be away too long." 

"One more thing." Katsuhito added "This man will be a guest here for as of yet an 
undetermined amount of time. So while he is here there is to be no fighting, and no brash 
display of one's powers, jurian or otherwise." he finsihed staring at both Ryoko and Ayeka 
"As a suggestion and a precaution." he said "You two will focus your efforts on caring for 
Mayuka, you seem to fight less around her than any other." Both girls looked at each other, 
then Mayuka ,then Katsuhito, then nodded in silent agreement.

"Well I'm off." Tenchi said as he walked out the door. 

"Have a safe journey Lord Tenchi." Ayeka told him 

"Don't get into any trouble without me, Tenchi." Ryoko said 

"See you all again soon." Tenchi said as he waved and closed the door behind him.

A red dot flashed on Kiyone's viewscreen as it began a path across it. 

"We've got you this time." she cried out "STEP ON IT MIHOSHI!" Kiyone shouted to her partner.

"Gotcha." she acknowledged as she roared the ships egines into action. "Ummmh, Kiyone.?" 

"Yes, Mihoshi." 

"Which way should we be headed." 

"What!?" screamed Kiyone as she spun around to face the pilots chair occupied by Mihoshi. 
As she looked over Mihoshi's shoulder she glaned at the Navcom display. 

"We're going the wrong way." she realized. "Mihoshi, turn around quickly." 

"what is it?" she asked as she spun her chair around to face Kiyone. 

"No not you." her partner screamed. "Turn the ship around, we're headed the wrong way."

"Oh ok." Mihoshi giggled. 

Mihoshi grabbed the controls and steered the ship into a sharp 
hairpin turn, all the while feeding even more life to the ships engines. Kiyone was thrown 
around the cockpit finally coming to rest along the back wall amidst a pile of fluttering 
paper and discarded plastic cups. 

"Why me." she groaned helplessly.

The silver/black cruiser cut through to normal space, it's pilot adjusted the controls to 
sublight speed. 'Nothing to do now but wait.' he thought as he ran a hand through his green 
spiked hair. "Oh well." he said to himself "A job is a job." He scratched his chin as he 
contemplated his latest contracted employer. A large disembodied head calling itself D3 had 
paid him a large sum of credits to lead around some Galaxy Police officers stationed in 
sector 0315. The question he wondered, was why. As his ships sensors picked up the oncoming 
police cruiser, he slowed his ship. "Let's do something different today." he said to himself
as he switched on his comm unit.

"Kiyone." 

"Yes Mihosi, what is it." 

"Umm, we have an incoming transmission." 

"Well what are you waiting for bring it up."

"Oh, right." Mihoshi replied as she switched on the comm. A view screen popped up to her 
left displaying a green haired man ,he fiddled with his goatee then rested his chin in his 
hand. 

"Hello, my lovely pursuant." he said to Mihoshi. "Are you enjoying your chase." 

"Oh my." giggled Mihoshi as she blushed. 

"Alright buster!" Kiyone yelled "Pull over and prepare to be boarded." 

The green haired man merely raised an eyebrow, "Tell me beautiful, how did a 
cute girl like yourself end up with an ice queen as a partner." 

"What!" screamed Kiyone as Mohishi continued to giggle. "Look buddy, I've had enough of 
you already, Mihoshi lock onto his ship with the tractor beam." 

"Why would we do that Kiyone." her partner asked 

"So we can arrest him. Geez Mihoshi pay attention will you." 

"Heh, you can arrest me any day cutie." the green haired man replied as he stared at Mihoshi
"Well any day but today. Ta-Ta ladies. See you again soon."

 the view screen vanished from sight. At the same moment the silver/black cruiser began to 
accelerate. 

"Quick Mihoshi!" Kiyone yelled nail that creep before he gets away. 

"Right!" Mihoshi replied as she targetted the ships tractor beam on the escaping vessel. 
A beam of energy shot from the police cruiser, as it reached it's target the other ship 
simply vanished leaving only empty space. 

"Damnit!" Kiyone swore as she slammed her fist down on 
the console 

"Wow." giggled Mihoshi "He thinks I'm cute..."

Washu typed away at her holo-top. She had just finished going over the data from the 
disturbance earlier. There was a knock at the door.
"Come in." she shouted "It's open." She turned around on her cushion.
"How is Sasami?" she asked. 

"She is fine." Katsuhito replied offering her a cup of tea.
"but she can remember very little of the nightmare." 

"I can understand why." Washu added 
"Sasami's dream was a chronometric rift at a psychic level." 

"I'm not quite up to par with you Washu." Katsuhito said with a puzzled expression on his 
face. 

"Sorry" she replied as she produced a cushion and motioned for him to sit. "As you know, 
due to Sasami's link with Tsunami, Sasami has the ability to sense through her dreams the 
possibility of future events." Washu paused to to take a sip of her tea. 

"So your saying that Sasami has seen a portion of a possible future for us correct." 
Katsuhito asked.

"Something like that, Yes." Washu replied. "Tell me, what does she remember about the dream." 

"All she can remember now." Katsuhito began "is we were apparently attacked and defeated 
by a stranger. When she found us the stranger attacked her only to be stopped by a second 
stranger whom the first killed shortly thereafter. And that is all."

"Standard premonition of forboding doom with an unsuccesful display of heroics." Washu said 
calmly "The only problem is, Sasami had the dream. But the informatin given by the data I 
collected show that the dream wasn't through her eyes." 

"Are you saying Sasami saw something that will come to pass, but that she saw it 
from inside someone else's mind." Katsuhito asked. 
"That's exactly right." Washu added as she finished her tea. "By the way, where is Mayuka?" 
she asked as she handed Katsuhito her empty cup. 

"Ayeka and Ryoko are with her in the onsen bathing." he replied. "Dinner will be 
ready shortly. 

"Hmm a bath would be nice about now." Washu said as she streched out along her seat. 

"Well then, if you'll excuse me." Katsuhito said as he stood up.

Washu nodded as she typed at terminal searching through an expansive selection of soaps and 
oils. As she decided on her selection a subspace hole opened besides her and a small basket
floated out. She picked up the basket and made her way to the bathhouse.

Tenchi parked the van a block from the shrine. 'A little walk never hurt anyone.' 
he thought to himself. He stared down at his watch as he began walking. It was much later 
than he thought. 'I hope everyone back home is ok' he thought as he smiled. As he turned 
the corner the shrine came into view he could see an old man sweeping the walkway. 
"Excuse me." Tenchi said politely 

"Ahh" the old man said as he removed his straw hat and wiped his brow. "You must be 
Katsuhito's grandson Tenchi." 

"Yes sir" Tenchi replied. 

"Well your guest is inside waiting for you." the old man replied. 

"Was inside." came a voice from the shrine. 

Tenchi looked up and saw a man descending the steps of the shrine. He wore jeans and 
sandals and a vest was worn over his sweatshirt. He carried a large green duffle bag slung 
over his shoulder. Tenchi couldn't make out his face as it was hidden underneath a straw hat
similar to the one worn by the old priest. The stranger reached the bottom of the steps 
and made his way toward Tenchi.

"You must be Tenchi." the stranger said as he extended his hand. 

"Yes, that would be me." Tenchi replied clasping hands with the stranger.
As the two greeted each other the stranger removed his hat.

D3 floated above the regen vat and peered inside. 'Yes' he thought to himself 'the extra 
cell matter I collected has accelerated the process along nicely, and with the residual 
Jurian energy left inside your cells after your defeat you should have no trouble from that 
boy this time.' The figure in the vat remained silent, but inside his mind was in turmoil 

'I can remember' he thought to himself 'I can remember who I was, NO! who I am... I am...'

'Kagato' Tenchi's mind screamed at him. 'You're shaking hands with Kagato.' Tenchi's face 
was a mask of horror. 

"Tenchi are you ok." the stranger asked as he let go of Tenchi's hand.
 Tenchi, frozen in shock , seemed unable to move. " Forgive my manners." the stranger 
apologized "Arkain Locke, at your service." He said as he bowed sweeping his hat before him 
in a grand flourish. 

"Huh" Tenchi suddenly snapped back into attention. "Arkain Locke." Tenchi 
repeated aloud 'Then he isn't, no how silly of me.' Tenchi though as he continued to stare 
at Arkain. He then noticed an eyepatch over Arkain's right eye.'How could I have thought 
this guy was Kagato.' Tenchi thought to himself 'true he does kind of look like him but 
that eyepatch. Kagato would never wear one of those Tenchi assumed. 

"Tenchi, what's wrong, you look like you've seen a ghost." 

"Huh , oh sorry Arkain. It's just that I thought for a minute you were someone else. But 
then I realized this other person doesn't wear an eyepatch." 

"Oh is that what it was." Arkain said as he adjusted his eyepatch for a more comfortable 
fit. "You had me worried there for a minute Tenchi, I thought you were going to pass out or 
something."

"No nothing like that." Tenchi said. 

"Well you boys had better get going if you want to beat that storm back." the old priest 
said. "Arkain you can keep that old hat, it looks good on you." 

"Thank you friend." Arkain replied "I'll keep your teachings close to me 
also."
Tenchi and Arkain stood before the old priest and bowed as he wished them a safe journey 
home.
