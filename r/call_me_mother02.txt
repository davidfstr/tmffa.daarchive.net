Hi again everyone! This part happens about 2 months after the original
story. I was intending the story to be just that one part, then I got some
ideas. Not very often that that happens! ^_^ So I'd thought I'd go with it.
I'll have more parts out as soon as I can, okay? Thanks! Email me with
ANYTHING at NeptuneDream@n2sun.com. Thanks a lot! Enjoy~~~

            Call me Mother! Part 2   *~*By NeptuneDream*~*

                 "Ryoko..." Tenchi embraced the woman in front of him. She
whispered something he couln't understand into his ear. He loved the way she
always felt, so warm, daring, and alive. He could feel it as her breath blew
lightly into his ear. He closed his eyes and smiled, appreciating the
wonderful moments they could have with each other. They kissed passionately,
and she smiled into his eyes. He looked at hers, they were beautiful yellow
eyes. Her face turned dark, and all Tenchi could see was those eyes. They
burned into his soul with a deepness he had never felt before. Ryoko smiled
again, and, without warning, disappeared. Tenchi looked past his empty arms,
and saw something other than the woman he loved. A dark figure reached out
for him, but it wasn't Ryoko. He tried to see the figure, but it was
completely dark. He felt something grab him, and he pulled away. He took out
the Tenchiken, but it didn't turn on when he summoned it. The figure pulled
out a sword of !
his own, a masamune. As he slashed it towards him, Tenchi saw nothing but
light.
------------------------------------------------------
 BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  The alarm woke Tenchi up. Tenchi looked to his
right, and there was Ryoko, staring at him.
     "Tenchi, what's the matter?" she asked with concern.
     "N...Nothing, I had a nightmare, that's all..."
     "Aww, my poor little Tenchi..."
     Tenchi smiled. "It's okay. It was just weird..."
     Ryoko looked at the door. "I think Sasami's making breakfast!"
    Tenchi smiled again, this time thinking about Sasami's cooking. "Isn't
it great that she decided to come back to Earth? I just wish Aeka would have
come back with her..."
    Ryoko's smile faded just a bit, remembering what had happened to her
when she had found Tenchi and Aeka together... "Meh, she found someone on
her own, and she IS the Crown Princess of Jurai now..." she giggled. "She
didn't wanna hang around with a bunch of weirdos her whole life, you
know..."
   Tenchi laughed quietly to himself. "Well then, shall we go get some?"
   Ryoko hopped out of bed quickly. "Yeah! I can't wait to eat her cooking
again!"
   "You can go ahead, I'll be down in a minute."
   "Okay, Tenchi..." Ryoko disappeared through the wall.
   Tenchi watched her for a moment, then looked at the ceiling in thought.
<Was what I dreamt of an omen? Something's going to happen... I just know
it...> He sighed and made his way down the stairs.
---------------------------------------------------------
 When Ryoko floated down the balcony to the table, everyone was already
there. Sasami popped up, spatula in hand.
  "Good morning, Ryoko!"
  Ryoko sighed contentedly. "Sasami, you don't know how much I've missed
this in the morning..."
  Sasami smiled cheerfully. "Well, I'm glad you like it! This is the best
breakfast ever!"
  Ryoko took a seat. Next to her was Mihoshi, eating from a huge plate of
food, with Kiyone looking over at her, a giant sweat drop on her head. "You
know, Mihoshi, you've already eaten firsts and seconds, we're going to run
out of food and then you won't be able to eat anymore till lunch and besides
that WE'RE LATE!"
 Mihoshi looked up from her plate. "Oh well! It's a special occasion!"
 Kiyone looked as if she was about to go crazy and blow up on Mihoshi just
like that. Instead, she just slumped down on her pillow and sighed. "I guess
you're right..."
Mihoshi smiled. "That's the spirit!" She then continued to eat at the speed
of light.
Ryoko looked to her right. Washu sat there, idly sipping a cup of tea.
 "Hi Mom, how are you?"
 "Oh hello Ryoko, I didn't even see you come down."
 "Is something the matter? You look really out of it..."
 "I had a very strange dream last night, Ryoko, that's all."
 "About what?"
 "I don't really remember a lot of it..."
 Tenchi suddenly appeared at the foot of the steps. "You had a strange dream
last night too, Ms. Washu?"
 Washu merely at glanced at the title Tenchi had used for her. She nodded.
 "What happened in yours, if you don't mind me asking, Tenchi?" asked
Mihoshi.
 "Well, it was weird..." He coughed nervously. "Ryoko and I
were...*cough*...loving, then she suddenly disappeared. A figure appeared,
and my Tenchiken didn't work. Then it reached out to me, took out a sword,
then struck...That's all I remember."
 Kiyone looked at Tenchi. "It was probably just a bad nightmare...Nothing
has happened here in so long..."
 Washu suddenly looked up. "I had the same dream," she said.
 Ryoko looked at Washu with a sweatdrop. "You were making out with me?"
 Washu sweatdropped. "No, I was not making out with you, Ryoko! Jeez!" She
sighed. "I just saw you two...courting, then the figure came towards me.
That's when mine ended. I woke up at about 3 in the morning and couldn't get
back to sleep. I'm exhausted."
Tenchi looked at her with concern. "I thought it might be an omen. But now
I'm convinced."
Washu nodded. "That's too strange. Come to my lab after breakfast."
"Okay."
"Can I come?" asked Ryoko.
"I suppose you should."
Mihoshi perked up. "I wanna come to your lab!"
Washu sweatdropped. "...............No."
"Aww..."
 -------------------------------------------------
 After breakfast, Tenchi, Washu, and Ryoko met in Washu's lab. Washu had
herself and Tenchi strapped to some strange machines.
 "So, Washu, what are these?" asked Ryoko.
 "This apparation will allow Tenchi and I to see the most recent dreams
stored in our memories. I will see his, and he will see mine. Since most of
our dreams are forgotten after the night, this will allow us to see each
others' dreams from last night, therefore proving that they are in fact the
same dream."
 Ryoko nodded.
 "Ready, Tenchi?"
 "Yep."
 Washu typed some things on her holopad. A machine started up, and she could
see Tenchi's dream.
   <She saw Ryoko's face come up and whisper something in Tenchi's ear. Then
Ryoko disappeared.  Then the figure appeared. She saw the Tenchiken in
Tenchi's hand just give off a slight glow instead of starting up. She saw
the sword come up, and the light flashed in her eyes.>

 As the machine started up, Tenchi saw Washu's dream.
  <He watched as himself and Ryoko kissed for a minute, then the figure
grabbed Washu. She tried to pull away. She couldn't generate a lightsaber,
and the figure's sword came slashing at her. Tenchi then saw the same
light.>

  Tenchi ripped off his visor. "That was it! It was the exact same dream!"
 Washu nodded. "This is interesting. Well, you two stay together, and keep
safe. I'm going to research this as much as possible. If I find out anything
interesting, I'll tell you as soon as I can."
 Tenchi nodded, a little shaken. "Okay, thanks, Washu."
Ryoko looked at Tenchi in concern and they left the lab.
-----------------------------------------------------

Tenchi and Ryoko sat outside in the trees that surrounded the Masaki house.
 "Tenchi, it was the exact same dream?"
 Tenchi nodded. "Yeah, it was. A little too strange, if you ask me."
 "I agree. But you know, Tenchi, I'll always be here, if you need me for
anything, I'll always be here to protect you and love you, you know that,
right?"
Tenchi smiled a little. "Yeah, thanks, Ryoko love."
Tenchi thought to himself. < I'm not so sure about that Ryoko, I might have
to keep you safe...>
