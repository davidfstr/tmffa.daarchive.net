Tenchi Muyo Does not belong to me. You understand this don't you?

Notes:
This is *my* first fan fiction ever.
I don't know where I'm going with this story.
I write as I go along, anyway Tenchi and Co.
will each have their own view of the story some will pop in and some will
out.
I hope you'll enjoy the Story, I'm thinking and at the end of this Chapter
I'll need some ideas of to what
will happen in the next Chapter so tell me what you'll like to see
and I'll kick it in here... like I said I write as I go so if this ends soon

I'm sorry, but do enjoy!
 This takes place after the OVA.

                                      *Tenchi's POV*

The Moons light was on my face as I slowly open my eyes to be

welcomed by a seat of golden sleepless eyes.

'Why me' I said in my head. It didn't look as if she new I was up and
looking
at her.

My eyes weren't what I would of said as to of being opened. I can see her
yet
she can't see

that I can.

A sound of some sort I heard. I opened my eyes fully to see that Ryoko was
sleeping

my eyes was playing with me in the dark room it did look as if her eyes were

open but it was

just the moons light agents her face.

I looked at my clock on my table to my right. It said 4:56 AM! I can't
sleep,

when everyone awakens I'll have to tell one of the unlucky girls which of
them namely Ryoko

or Ayeka who have their hands on my heart. I'm so unbearably happy to let
her
know that it

isn't her that she'll be able to go on with her life, yet I don't want to
tell her. It will

kill her to find out but I believe she is a strong woman and she will in the

end... well hopefully

not kill me...

'What happens if she doesn't understand?' a voice in side my head said.

'What happens if she leaves and never comes back?' again it said by now I

know this voice is not going to be any help.

'What happens if she try's to kill you and your love?' it replies a little
afraid.

'Shut up' I said back to it.

'Oh, come on Tenchi do you really think that?

That she'll just sit their and hear you say, "I'm sorry,

I don't Love you ... I don't want you to go because I don't want to be
lonely"

Fat chance Tenchi!'

The little bug in my head said.

'Look here. I'm not going to just sit right here and listen to you like a
fool.

I'm going to tell her then wait a week and then I'll tell my love-'

I was cut of by little me nice name for him too.

'If you love them all so much why have you waited a year? Your 18 years old.

She has put her whole life around you and when you give her the news what
you
think

she'll do? Run back to space that's what! You'll never she her again...

It will kill the others. If you new that you fall in love with the other
girl
about that

time we found out about the Sasami and Tsunami thing why haven't you spoken?

Let me guess, "I was only 17, I was a shy kid!" Well buddy your 18 and your
still that

same shy kid.'

Little me had finally shut up for me to speak.

'You just' I stopped to think about what I was about to say 'you,

just don't get it. I love her and I love the other... it is just that I
didn't want

to hurt them they were like Cats and Dogs. Now there well I can somewhat
call
it friends now,

and I know that she can handle it when I tell her whom I love'

I said. Then little me knew he was getting nowhere with this, so he kind of
change the topic.

'What do you love about the other one? I love her for the way she smiles it
just

some thing about it... I can't put my finger on it but it so heavenly.'

Little me said. Now this is a topic I'll enjoy.

'Everything' I reply felling a smile arose my lips... I hope Ryoko doesn't
awake.

'Give me a short list so I can get an hour of sleep"

Little me had just asked

'Her smile' I started 'her hair the way it moves in the wind.

Her lips the way they become even softer after sipping tea. Her skin the
ways it

sometimes becomes light pink when she has done something and try for her
best
not to

blush but I still can see it.

Her Eyes is what I love the most. I once looked into them I would have sworn

that I have

been to heaven and back.' (Yarn) I'm falling asleep already.

'Then her body I know I don't really look at her that way much but when I do

the way it

moves with her just makes it look as if she was in an never ending dance
of...'

I fell asleep

******************************************************************************

                                *Ryoko's POV*

'Look at him' I said to myself

'He looks as if he's dreaming of the most wonderful thing in the
world...maybe me!'

'I whish' a sheepish voice said. I can only guess whom!

'Here we go Zeros up! What fun!' I was being sarcastic

'Why don't you go greet Washu or Ryo-ohki?' I offered to my other self.

'Don't you ever wonder what he's thinking of?' was the reply to me.

'You already know what I think your up in my head are you not?' I just place

my eyes on the soon to awaken man of my dreams.

'Well see if I ever make small talk with you again. I'll just sit here and
look at my

love, wile you'll soon be hearing "Ryoko What are you doing...don't you ever

sleep?" ha I'll

just be here to back you up when it comes to "Ryoko I love you..."'

Then her, my, our, I don't know I give up! The Damn voice just went down to
almost a cry.

'Or "I love Ayeka"...' I can fell the tear coming. Getting ready to run down

my eyes then

down my cheeks, after that short trip it will land on my dear Tenchi's face
when it hits he'll

wake up and ask "Ryoko What are you doing here... don't you ever- why are
you crying?"

Then I'll have to say " Oh my dear Tenchi I was talking to Zero you know, my

other

self the softer side of me the one I can't show you because Ayeka will never

drop it if

I do side?"

Sounding like Mhoshi and I'll continue to talk the same way as if I was
begging with a

childish voice. "Well we was chatting and then you smiled in your sleep and
she thought

you was dreaming of Ayeka... and we just starting to... cry when who know
you
could have

been dreaming of Ryo-ohki for all we know but she just wanted to kick in
cause I wont 'make

small talk' with her."

So, I spoke up to wake my dear Tenchi and to stop my other self's plan of
embracement for me.

It was 7:15 already and Sasami will have breakfast at 7:30 soon and my
Tenchi
don't normally

sleeps this late... whatever he's dreaming of he must be enjoying it...

'I hope its us...' Zero Said

'Even if it's Ayeka and if it is I don't really mind as long as Tenchi's

happy no matter if it's not me but that little princess... when my Tenchi is

happy it

mean the World to me' I said

'Am I coming out on you to much' Zero joked to keep us from tearing up.

'Sick joke, Time to wake up sleeping beauty' I told her

I move in close to his face I get ready for the jump he'll give me when he
sees me then

the "Ryoko what are you doing... Don't you sleep?" well here goes...

"Good morning Sweetie pie" I said out loud so that he will awake and

he did as soon as I said morning.

_____________________________________________________________________________

                                 *Tenchi's POV*

She's standing their looking at me I had called her outside

to go on a walk to the Cave. She stood their looking at me with her Eyes
that
are so

often filled with heavenly love.

"What is it that you wanted?" She said as if she new what I was going to
tell
her.

So much hope and pain in her eyes I was going to tell her then and now!

I began " I love-morning" Damn Cut off and Awaken.

                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Awaken~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Ryoko what are you doing... Don't you sleep?" I asked her. I can almost see

her

lips say it with me as one... I dismissed it for I did really see well I
have
just awoken.

"It's already 7:17 Tenchi and Sasami has breakfast at 7:30 for us... you
don't want

to get her mad now do we?"

She said sleeplessly looking at me as if I was hiding something of hers then

she spoke

again with a smirk on her face where a small smile used to lay.

"Tenchi, dear what were you dreaming of... was it me?" Buy the time I heard

dreaming I jumped up she was already out of my way. like she had planed
this.
Did

I say something out loud? Thank the Gods she answer my question.

"You were just smiling like Ryo-ohki to her Carrots"

I then gave her a look that said 'I need to get ready, get out' and she was
gone...

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


                                      *Ayeka POV*

"Good morning, Sasami, Mhoshi, Brother, and Father"

I greeted them and took a seat where I always do. That monster Woman came
in.

"And here I was thinking it was going to be a lovely morning."

I greeted Ryoko someone out of the family might of think I was being rude

to the woman but here in this family we have grown to greet each other.

"Au Prince Ayeka" She greeted me I gave her a 'hump' and she sat to my left
leaving a

space for Tenchi in between us.

Then Sasami called out to me " Hay Ayeka can you give me a hand?"

She asked in that loveable child voice of hers. "I'll be right their Sasami"

as I stood from my sit then Lord Tenchi came down the stairs

"Good morning Lord Tenchi, Have you rest well?" I asked as he slowly walked
over

to me. "Yes I have and you?" he asked me "the same as you" I said "I'll be
off to help
Sasami now"

I was now about to face the door but before I did Lord Tenchi

asked Miss Ryoko something he looked somewhat hurt and worried "May I have a

word with

you Ryoko... alone?" Maybe he's going to tell here that he had picked me! I
smiled as I walked

to help Sasami.

==============================================================================

                               *Tenchi's POV*

Ryoko has just left my room. I have just left from the hall where

I have been using the washroom. I fond my red short sleeve shirt, and my

long blue jeans that I have worn on the first time we took the girls to the
hot springs

and I hade to fight that monster Ryoko had created. I looked in my mirror I
still look the

same as I did when I was 17 come to think of it I was 17 April now it...
June
the 17th and

mind summer's eve is in the next…5 days. Oh, well the 6th day will be the
festival I'll plan

to tell her then!

{Ryoko here... I just wanted you to know Tenchi's b-day wan in April 1.
I have this Tenchi Muyo calendar from 1996 and their b-days are in it. And
that
Mind-summers eve will be on a Saturday in this story so to day is Sunday.}

Today will be the day that the unlucky one gets but I have a plan

I'll spend the hold week with her until the festival that way she'll know

I still care hopefully the other one wont get jealous.

Well I'm walking out of my room now I slid the door open and walk to the
stairs

where at the top I can see Ryo-ohki, Dad, Grandpa, Mhoshi, Ryoko and Ayeka.

I can see Ryoko and Ayeka sitting next to each other... she looks so
beautiful down their...

ell time to make my move...

'Oh, before I forget' I said to my self as I walked down the stairs. Ayeka
gets up

from her place on the table as Sasami asked her something then she sees me.

"Good morning Lord Tenchi, Have you rest well?" She asks me as I move in

closer to her and the sitting Ryoko.

"Yes, I have and you?"  I ask "the same as you" she said and

paused then said  "I'll be off to help Sasami now"

I looked at her then Ryoko. I hope they can't she how hurt and worried

I'm felling on my face. As Ayeka turns and gets ready to help Sasami with
whatever she

needs help with I turned to Ryoko.

"May I have a word with you Ryoko... alone?" I asked her I can see a small
smile

on Ayeka as she left I wonder what she's thing? Ryoko gave me a small nod as

she rose

from her sitting place and walks with me to the staircase.

"Ryoko" I began.
