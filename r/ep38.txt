CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Tenchi Muyo! TV Theme" Basacally the same as the TV opening with the 
	following changes: Megumi is chasing Kamadake.
			 A Tenchi and Seion sparing sesion	
			 Nagi's in it
			 Misaki, Tsunami, and Sasami are in the kitchen
			 Aeka and Ryoko are not fighting over Tenchi.

SCENE 1: The Masaki House: "Mrs. Masaki's" Office. (That room that Achika's ghost showed to 
	Kiyone in "No Need For Santa!")

		Kiyone is going over the store's finances when she gets a call on the GP ComSyst.
	Dectective Sgt. Jinnai is on the other end.

KIYONE: Ah, Detective Sergeant. Is there anything I can do for you?

JINNAI: Yeah, you can take my job! Your promotion just came in!

KIYONE: That's great!..........Wait a minute! What's the catch?

JINNAI: Oh, just four new officers for the Solar System. What with all the members of the
	Royal Family living on Earth, the Grand Marshal thought we should have a bigger 
	presence. That and MY promotion to Lt. Jinnai came through!

KIYONE: Four new officers? I don't see how that can be a problem.

SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 37: NO NEED FOR ROOKIES!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE 2: The newly relocated GP sub-station on the far side of the moon. Troz Iniz, the 7'6" 
	cycloptic sniper, is with the four new officers. One of them, Takashi, is a jarhead
	type, the second one, a young lady by the name of Yashimo, has long silver hair and 
	eyes while the other two look a little like, no, wait, they are! It's Yura and Amarobei!

TROZ: When I call you name say "Here!" TAKASHI!

TAKASHI: (hops to the desk and lands at attention) HERE, SIR!

TROZ: Uh, yeah. You scored high in engineering at the Academy, I see.

TAKASHI: And in hand-to-hand combat, sir! I can take anyone on this station!

TROZ: Uh, whatever. I'll be sure to tell Seion you called him out. You get to work in the 
	repair bay with Detective 2nd class Toshiro. Just go to where you guys came in at and
	report in. (he hands Takashi his orders and sends him on his way) YASHIMO!

YASHIMO: Here, Detective!

TROZ: A qualified weapon repair technician, huh?

YASHIMO: Yes, Detective!

TROZ: You'll be working with me in the armory. Take you seat over there until I'm done with
	these two.

YASHIMO: Yes, Detective! (she sits back down)

TROZ: YURA!

YURA: Present, Detective 1st Class Iniz!

TROZ: Communications Officer? You'll get to work with Detctive 1st Class Demi. Report to the 
	Command center. She won't be hard to find. She's the fuzzy one.

YURA: Aye aye, sir! (she takes her orders and heads off to the command center)

TROZ: AMAROBEI!

AMAROBEI: Right here, Troz my man!

TROZ: What was that?!

AMAROBEI: I just said "hi"! Jeeze, don't blow a gasket on me, old man!

TROZ: WHAT?!!!!

AMAROBEI: Whadda I say? Look, I know your under a lot of stress right now so I'll just go to
	my quarters and let you-

TROZ: SIT DOWN!!!!!!

AMAROBEI: Okay, okay. I wouldn't want you to have a heart attack on my account!

TROZ: THAT'S IT! I was going to assign you the easy job of driving the crew from the station
	to earth, but since you wanna be a wise ass, I'm giving Detective 3rd Class Megumi that
	job and giving you the one I had lined up for her!

AMAROBEI: And what would that be?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCENE 3: The Masaki House. 

		Megumi, Seion, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Misaki are gathered around Kiyone's desk.
	Troz is on the ComSyst talking with them.

SEION: YOU WHAT?!!

TROZ: Like I said, You now have Rookie Detective Amarobei as your new partner!

SEION: Damn you, Troz! If black book operations counted towards promotions I'd come up there
	and be such a tyrannical overlord that you'd be begging for me to kill ya!

KIYONE: You're still mad because Mihoshi, Achie, Mitsuki, and me all made Detective Sgt. 
	before you did.

SEION: You and Mihoshi I don't mind. But how often do you risk your life behind a desk? Or
	in Mitsuki's case, under one? (all the GP people get a good laugh from that one) But
	seriously though, is there anything you can do about getting us in Special Operations
	a little more consideration in promotions, Your Majesty?

MISAKI: It's not up to me right now. It's for the next Emperor to decide.

SEION: Then I guess I'll have to butter up Ryoko and Aeka.

KIYONE: Why? Tenchi is the first in line for the throne.

SEION: Yeah, and if I get in good with his fiances, he's so spinless towards them that he'll
	do anything that they ask.

MIHOSHI: Wow! Can you get us a nice vacation house on that beach planet?

SEION: Consider it done!

MEGUMI: Oh, and can I get some stuff to help keep Kamadake from resisting me when I'm trying
	to seduce him?

SEION: Only if you're good. (he steps out the door and then sticks his head back in) Even if 
	you're not.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SCENE 3: GP Sub-station. 

		The cast is taking a tour of the Station

TENCHI: So, this is what the inside of a Galaxy Police Station looks like.

NOBOYUKI: Rather spartan. The architects the GP hires really lack imagination and asthetics.
	If I were to design it, I'd have gone with a nice Neo-Classical style. But this...this
	style makes it look like a Stormtrooper ship rather than a house of the law. I keep
	expecting Darth Vader to walk out of one of these doors.

SEION: Well, don't look at me. They kept rejecting my ideas for improvemnets.

KIYONE: Your "improvemnets" called for a topless bar and a gladiator arena!

AEKA: HENTAI!

MISAKI: ECCHI!

SASAMI: NAUGHTY BOY!

RYOKO: What's all the fuss about? A gladitator pit sounds fun and I don't mind topless 
	women. I already know that mine are better than their's will ever be! Ne, Tenchi?

TENCHI: Uh, ne?

TROZ: Oh, I almost forgot. The new uniforms have been delivered.

MIHOSHI: You mean Grampa finally went with our uniform ideas?

SEION: YEEEEEEEHHHAWWW! No more powder blue vest! No more two tone gray pants! Indigo blue
	and dark gray fatigues here I come!

KIYONE: Yes! We'll finally look like a REAL law enforcment orginization!

MEGUMI: Yeah! Me and Mihoshi got the idea from what the police in Tokyo were wearing.

RYOKO: I thought you got the idea from watching "You're Under Arrest!" for three days strait.

MEGUMI: They worked in Tokyo, didn't they?

AEKA: And you also took some ideas after reading that entire stack of "Dominion", "Appleseed",
	and "Ghost in the Shell", didn't you?

MIHOSHI: Well, we uh..........

SASAMI: Weren't you also watching "Macross 7" at the time?

DEMI: That was Seion who was watching that. He thought Mylene was cute. Personally, I can't
	stand girls with voices like that!

SEION: You got a voice like that, Demi. And you do like Tomo Sakurai, the voice of Mylene.

DEMI: Shut up!

KIYONE: That's enough out of you two! You have to get acustomed to your new partners. Ah!
	Here's the room. (Kiyone opens the door to reveal Yura and Amarobei. Kiyone is frozen
	tracks when she see's them. She is not to thrilled to see them.) YOU! You are the two
	little theives who stole MY YAGAMI!

AMAROBEI: Uh-oh.

SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK

SCENE: P-chan sitting on a building looking over into a window with Ukyo cooking 
	okinamiyoki and singing "Only You" to her (or is it the meal she's making)

ANNOUNCER: Fall in love with a Japanese Pizza all over again, now only 150 yen for a 
regular with the purchase of a large drink for a limited time only at Uchan's.

	(P-chan is now in Ukyo's arms. He looks into the camera and says, in Japanese)

P-CHAN: I want Uchan's!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

		Back to the scene we were just in.

KIYONE: How the hell did you two ever get into the Academy?

YURA: Ma'am! They gave us a choice between jail, the Galaxy Police, and apologizing to you, 
	Ma'am!

AMAROBEI: If Idda know I'd be stationed with a bunch of losers with rods up the butts Idda
	said I was sorry.

KIYONE: Why you little........

SEION: Now, Kiyo-

KIYONE: You stay out of this! This doesn't concern you!

SEION: Hey, that's my partner your threatening to kill!
 
AMAROBEI: You tell that upitty bitch, Seion!

SEION:(with a postal look on his face) And nobody kills my partner but me! Come, PARTNER. 
	Let's go to the gym.(he grabs Amarobei by the nose ring and leads him out.)

KIYONE: How dare he call me that! I'm gonna.......(before she can act, Noboyuki puts his
	arms around her.)

NOBOYUKI: Come on. Lets not kill any one today. You still have a wedding to plan and you 
	can't do that from prison.

KIYONE:(blushing and giggling) Okay, Nobi-chan. (the two of them leave)

RYOKO:(snickering) She called him.....NOBI-CHAN!

TENCHI: Ryoko........

		As they go down the hallway, they walk past a door marked "GYM" From behind the
we hear some not to pleasant coversation and a severe beating.

AMAROBEI: PLEASE!(WHACK!) OW! SOMEBODY SAVE ME!(THUD!)

SEION: COME ON! (CRACK!) LAUGH IT UP, FUNNY BOY!

AMAROBEI: OH GOD! (WHUMP!) NO! NOT THAT!

			WHACK!
			WHACK!
			WHACK!
			WHACK!
			WHACK!
			WHACK!

		The sound of Amarobei's carcass is heard hitting the ground. Seion walks out 
	and yells back into the gym.

SEION: And the next time you call my sister a bitch, try not to bleed on me!

AMAROBEI: Y-y-y-y-yes, s-s-ssir.

	SCENE 4: The Masaki Grounds. 

		Tenchi, Ryoko, and Aeka are out for a walk around the land. Aeka is carrying a 
	picnic basket, Ryoko has a blanket and thermos. Tenchi has an umbrella. They are closely
	followed by two GP officers with their communicators in constant contact with the base.

GP 1: Royal Shadow to Luna. Royal Shadow to Luna. Their Highnesses and Ryoko are proceding up
	hill to the picnic site. We are approximately 2.5 meters behind them. Over!

DEMI:(sigh) Fine. Whatever. Tell me when something IMPORTANT happens, okay.

GP 2: When something important happens, aye, Ma'am! And you really should end each transmition 
	"over". Over!

DEMI: AND STOP SAYING OVER!

GP 1: Yes, Ma'am!

RYOKO: Geeze, what's with the jarheads?

AEKA: Obviously they don't think Azaka and Kamadake can't do the job because they can't be seen
	so these two volunteered to keep an eye on us.

TENCHI: Call Seion back up! I'd rather have him following us around than these two. Well, this
 	looks like a nice spot. I think we'll stop here. (As the three stop, the two GP's bump 
	into Tenchi)

GP 1&2: We've stopped, ma'am!

TENCHI&DEMI: WILL YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF?!!!

GP 1: YES, SIR! I WILL CARRY OUT YOUR ORDERS TO THE LETTER SIR!

RYOKO: Wait, you mean you guys will do anything we say?

GP 2: YES, MA'AM! As a consort to his Royal highness we are pledged to carry out your orders!

RYOKO: Really? Heh-heh-heh...........

		A FEW MINUTES LATER..........
 
GP 1: More tea, Miss Ryoko?

RYOKO: Put some honey in it this time. And you, the sun's in my eyes again! Move the umbrella
	so that it blocks the sun.

GP 2: Yes, ma'am.

TENCHI: Don't you think you're overdoing it a bit, Ryoko?

AEKA: I'll have to say, she's behaving just like a Jurian Noblewoman.

RYOKO: Why thank you, Aeka.(she lifts her glass towards Aeka)

AEKA: Not at all. A toast. (as Aeka lifts her glass to Ryoko's, a energy blast hits the glasses
	and shatters them, cutting Aeka's hand and burning Ryoko's) AAAAHHHHH!!! (a few more blast
	fly at them as they duck. The two GP's fall to the ground as a few more blast fly past 
	them)

RYOKO: ARRRRRGGH! WHO THE HELL-? (Ryoko looks around and sees a flash of light and a few people
	running away) You can't get away from me that easlily! (as Ryoko tries to fly, she falls
	to the ground) Damn this power lock-out of Washu's!

TENCHI: You stay with Aeka! I'll take care of them!

AEKA:(looking at the two GP's) Oh my! They shot those two poor officers!

RYOKO: No they didn't! They just fainted. 

	(as Tenchi runs into the woods after them,he passes by Azaka with his foot on the head of
	one of the perpetrators. Tenchi doesn't seem to notice them as he passes through. A little
 	further into the woods, he runs by Kamadake who has tied another one of the hit men to the
	tree. For some reason, Kamadake's outfit is half-way on. I wonder why. Maybe the bushes
	will tell us)

MEGUMI: (from the bushes) Kame-chan? Did you use my dress and underwear to tie him to the tree?

	(Anyways, back to the case. Tenchi is still chasing two of the men down. Tenchi whips out
	Tenchi-ken and And dives for one of the men and manages to tackle him. Tenchi then stands
	up and points Tenchi-ken to the guy's throat as he reaches for his gun.)

TENCHI: Try it! (But the other guy manages to make it to the ship and fly off, leaving his 
	friend behind)

		MEANWHILE, IN ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH.........

	(Seion and Amarobei are onboard the GP Pursuit Ship Midorishu. Amarobei has a few bandages
	on his face from the beating he recieved earlier)

SEION: And next time you fight someone, don't use your face, groin and chest to beat up their
	fist, feet, knees, and elbows.

AMAROBEI: Seion, where you hit in the head alot when you were little?

SEION: Ha-ha! Was I hit in the head? Heh-heh.....why you ask? (Just then an alarm goes off on
	the control panel) Looks like we gotta an unauth trying to get by us.

AMAROBEI: Boy is he in a hurry. Wonder why. (As he say that, Yura's face pops up on the monitor)

YURA: Detective 1st Class Makibi! That ship that's leaving the planet has someone that just 
	tried to kill Ryoko and Aeka! You have to stop them before they get out of the system!

SEION: Righto! Seion out!(turns to Amarobei) How good of a pilot are you?

AMAROBEI: Uh, I was the top pilot of my class and am rated at 9.3 on standard GP ships.

SEION: Good. You fly. I'll target.

AMAROBEI: WHAT?!!! But I'm just a rookie! I ain't s'posda be driving in pusuit situations until
	I'm make Third!

SEION: Look, Kei-

AMAROBEI: Amarobei.

SEION: Sorry, it's the hair. Anyway, I'm only rated 3.1 on that ten point scale, which means you
	are three time better than me at this. NOW DRIVE!!!

AMAROBEI: YES SIR!!

		(And so begins the high speed chase at just over the speed of light. They blow past
	Mars, through the asteriod belt, slingshot around Jupiter, between Saturn's rings, past
	Uranus [like, he typed anus] and are now passing Neptune)

AMAROBEI: Why does he keep going near the planets? Why doesn't he just make a strait line outta
	the system?

SEION: Because he can't outrun a GP pursuit ship! These things are designed to be faster than 
	Ryo-ohki. He's hoping to lose us aroud these planets and moons. The gravity also screws 
	the targeting of the weapons! We're gonna have to do something drastic! Get along side of
	him and stall him! If he gets past Pluto, he's free. We have to get him before he gets that
	far! I'm going to the Crash Rocket. I'll try to board him.

AMAROBEI: What do you mean.

SEION: Keep him in THIS system! 

AMAROBEI: Good luck.

		(As the Midorishu closes in on the other ship, the crash rocket launches and nails 
	it's target dead center)

AMAROBEI: ALRIGHT! DIRECT HIT! Seion's on board!

		(But as suddenly as the rocket hit, it slips out of it's hole and tumbles past the
	Midorishu)

AMAROBEI: Omigosh! SEION! Are you there?!!

SEION: Don't worry about the rocket, kid! STOP THAT SHIP! Seion out!

AMAROBEI: RIGHT!........but how.

	FLASHBACK TO THE ACADEMY OFFENSIVE PILOTING CLASS

INSTRUCTOR: This will work if you ship total force is greater than the fleeing ship momentum.
	Line up the nose of your craft with the tail of the fleeing craft. Then put your engines
	at full power while, at the same instant, turn towards the fleeing ship. If done correctly
	and you have the more powerful ship, you should be able to send the fleeing ship spinning
	out of control. The ship's pilot will have to cut all of his power and reset his gyroscope
	to regain control or risk crashing or blacking out. This is know as "fishtailing" or as 
	the popular slang calls it, "Yoshoing" after the Jurian Prince who used this manuver to
	defeat many an enemy.

	BACK TO THE MIDORISHU

AMAROBEI: THAT'S IT! YOSHO'EM! 

	(Amarobei lines up his nose next the the other ship's tail and, sure enough, does manange
to "Yosho" the fleeing ship right into Charon, the moon of Pluto.)

	ON BOARD THE FORMERLY FLEEING SHIP.....

PILOT: DAMN! He got us! We can still get to the escape rocket and blast outta the system before
	he can get down here and arrest us!

GUNMAN: We'd better do it fast. Kairi's not gonna like it when we tell him Aeka is still alive!
	He's gonna lose alot of cash on this operation.

PILOT: Let's just get outta here! (as he opens the door, there is a rather large gun pointed at
	his face. As the person who's hand the gun is in walks out, he is revealed to be Seion)

SEION: Your rights under Galaxy Police Special Operations Arrest Procedetures are as follows.
	You have none. This is a SPECOP Operation. You will formally be read your rights at the
	nearest GP station. For the duration the trip to said station, you are officially the 
	property of GPSPECOPS. Any questions?

	LATER, IN KIYONE'S OFFICE........

KIYONE: YOU CAUSED J500,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO THE MIDORISHU AND YOU LOST A CRASH ROCKET!! DID
	IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU TO CALL FOR BACK UP? YOU ARE DISMISSED, DETECTIVE ROOKIE! I WANNA 
	YELL AT YOU A LITTLE MORE, SEION!

AMAROBEI: Yes Ma'am. (he leaves and closes the door)

KIYONE: (she looks at Seion) Well?

SEION: Great acting job!

KIYONE: You really think so? I mean, was I a convincing......

SEION: Hard-ass? Yes. But you'll have to admit, he did a great job.

KIYONE: (smiles) That he did.

	SCENE 6: A DARK ROOM...........

	A large man is sitting in a chair as another man comes in an kneals before him.

KENSHIRO: General Kairi, the men you have sent out to kill Aeka have failed. Their last trans-
	mission included the name of Seion Makibi. 

KAIRI: You may go now.

KENSHIRO: Yes sir. (he exits the room.)

KAIRI: I finally found you, Seion. My lady will be very pleased that you have gathered
	together all by yourselves...................
