CUE OPENING THEME: "Imasara Sekitsui Dobutsu" by Ai Orikasa
(Ryoko)
(opening credits feature the gang as a musical group with Ryoko
as the lead singer, Tenchi,
Yosho,and Noboyuki on horns, Kiyone on piano, Aeka, Sasami, and
Misaki as back-up singers, Washu on techno-equipment, Washu A and
B on drums, Mihoshi on lead electric triangle, Nagi on bass, and
Seion on lead guitar.)
SCENE: An misty landscape inside of Sasami's Dream
SASAMI: Jujugem-jujugem bono sureekyrei! Sammy Davis broiler
chicken!(Pretty Sammy trans- formation sequence but you can use
"Pretty Mutation! Magical Recall!" if you prefer)
The Magical Girl Pretty Sammy! Are ready to stop being mean to
people now? (We see her talking to a busty redhead and a set of
blue and purple eyes. Her face looks strangly familiar. Someone
Kiyone and Seion know very well.......)
WOMAN: I see that Tsunami has chosen a champion. Let it be known
that Tokimi has chosen as well, whelp! (She out-streaches her
hand and lets looses a tremendous shockwave towards Sammy. Sammy
tries to block it but it is just to much for her and she is
knocked back about 50 feet and lands at the feet of another
woman. When the woman kneels down by Sasami we see that it is
Tsunami. As she holds Sasami's lifeless body she begins to cry.)
TSUNAMI: What does want from me? You didn't have to kill her.
WOMAN: Tokimi sent me to capture Washu and yourself. As for me,
just tell Kiyone that an old classmate of her's is looking for
her.(Insert maniacal laughter here)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 31: NO NEED FOR SEMPAI!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE:The house at night. All is quiet until Sasami wakes up with
a scream and starts crying her eyes out. Nagi, who's in the room
with her, wakes up along with the cabbits.
NAGI: What's wrong Sasami?
SASAMI: I had a scary dream!(she starts crying some more)
NAGI: It'll be alright, Princess.(She gives Sasami a hug) After
all, you share a room with the greatest bounty hunter in the
Universe. No one will get you while I'm here.(Tenchi comes to the
door)
TENCHI: Are you alright Sasami?(Sasami gets up and run toward
Tenchi and grabs on to his waist)
SASAMI: Tenchi! This bad woman came and hurt me real bad and I
died.and now she's says she's looking for Kiyone!(crying still) I
don't want anything bad to happen to Kiyone! Tsuna-I mean, Pretty
Sammy has to protect her! Can you take me to her? 
TENCHI: Sure, Sasami. (Sasami rides on Tenchi's leg as he walks
out)
KEN-OKI: Chiao?
RYO-OKI: Miya!
NAGI: Are you two still serious about having little cabbits?
(as we see Tenchi and Sasami approching the door to Miho-Kiyo's
room we see a tie on the door knob.)
TENCHI: Somebody has to learn to pick up after themselves (he
knocks and after a while somebody
comes to door-someone who isn't Kiyone or Mihoshi)
SEION: What! Don't you know what a tie on a doorknob means?
TENCHI: Oh, there you are! What are you doing in there?
SEION: Well, I was playing "Good cop, bad cop" with Mihoshi until
you came along. She'll probably find her way out of those cuffs
any second now!
SASAMI: Wow! Can I play to?
TENCHI&SEION: NO!
TENCHI: Where's Kiyone?
SEION: With your dad watching "Captain Tylor" reruns. Now if you
don't mind, this bad cop has an interrigation to get back to!
Good night!(He shuts the door)
(As Tenchi and Sasami make there way downstairs, they hear
Kiyone's playful laughter)
TENCHI: Kiyone! Where are you at? (we see Kiyone's head pop up
from the couch with her shirt partialy unbuttoned)
KIYONE: Oh, Hi Tenchi! And I see you have Sasami with you!
TENCHI: Where's dad? 
NOBOYUKI:(from the couch) I'm down here!
TENCHI: Uhhh..(teardrop) anyway, Sasami had a scary dream and
insited on protecting you from the woman in her dream!
SASAMI: Yeah! The magical girl Pretty Sammy always protects
people!
KIYONE: Oh, well isn't that sweet? (she walks toward Sasami
buttoning her shirt)
SASAMI: Can we go talk to Miss Washu about it?
KIYONE: I'm sure Little Washu can help us. Let's go talk to her
now! (They go into the storage unit that Washu's {WASHU: What was
that?} I mean, Little Washu's lab is in)
TENCHI: Just what do you think you're doing, Dad?
NOBOYUKI: I THINK I'm trying to go to the kitchen, but I could be
wrong.(and he does just that with Tenchi in tow)
TENCHI: I meant with Kiyone!
NOBOYUKI: Son, it's time he had a little talk about-
TENCHI: Don't worry about that, Grandpa already explained it to
me. But I couldn't understand what he was saying so I went to
Seion and he explained it in very graphic terms. Belive me, I
know more than I ever wanted to.(Seion walks in)
SEION: Oh, it's you. You know, if there was ever a cure for sex
you'd be it! Mihoshi's no longer in the mood! Thanks alot!
NOBOYUKI: I know what you mean. I had Kiyone's bra off and was
about to-
SEION: AND JUST WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS TOWARD MY SISTER?!
NOBOYUKI: Please don't kill me! I love Kiyone a lot and-
SEION: Okay. Just don't mention you, sex and my sister while I'm
around!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Little Washu's Lab. She's got a device on Sasami's head
that can project a person's dreams on to a viewscreen. Sasami's
asleep
WASHU: Let's see here. All signs show that Sasami is perfectly
normal.
KIYONE: And what about this reflection of hers? How come only you
and I have see it?
WASHU: Well, I know why I can see it. But I don't know enough
about you to make that analysis-
not yet anyway. Heh heh!(with that the greatest scietific genius
in the Universe punches a 
couple of buttons on her control pad and a large number of
metalic tenticles grab on to the
sexiest woman to ever put on a Galaxy Police uniform and procede
to remove said uniform) I
just need to run a few test and get some samples! I'll just
program a nice dream for Sasami
while we conduct the test! I hope you don't mind if the probes
get a little intimate with you!
(no matter what the point of view is, there always seems to be
something in the way that blocks
out Kiyone's private parts) Just relax and let me do all the
work!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Morning. The shrine. Tenchi and Seion are fixing their own
breakfast since Sasami,
Washu, and Kiyone are nowhere to be found and Noboyuki had to
leave for work early today
which left Ryoko and Aeka to make breakfast. I need not say more.
SEION: And I thought Washu was the only one who could create a
new life form out of eggs,
waffle batter and miso soup mix!
TENCHI: You forgot about that high octane rocket fuel that Ryoko
called pineapple juice!
SEION: Please, for your own safety, if you ever do marry them,
follow the Jurian Tradition
and marry Sasami when she grows up also. In the mean time, order
out!
TENCHI: Looks like it's about done. GRAMPA! ASAKA! KAMADAKI!
BREAKFAST IS READY!
ASAKA: And what are we eating this morning, my Lord?
TENCHI: Sweet potatoes, rice and breakfast steaks!
KAMADAKI:(offscreen) HELP! SHE'S AFTER ME AGAIN!(Kamadaki runs by
followed closly by Megumi)
MEGUMI: BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A HUG! COME BACK!(They both
run down the stairs)
ASAKA: He must be in love.
TENCHI: What do you mean? He trying his best to escape from her!
SEION: Doesn't look like he's trying to hard to me.
TENCHI: Huh?
YOSHO: He's a Jurian Knight. If he really wanted to he could
easily evade her and be five miles away before she knew he was
gone.
TENCHI: So he's trying to get caught? But why? (the other three
have huge smiles on their faces)
AEKA:(offscreen) Lord Tenchi! There you are! Why aren't you
eating the meal Ryoko and I made for you? (She and Ryoko walk on
screen)
RYOKO: Yeah. Me and Aeka worked real hard on it.(she gives him
those puppydog eyes)
TENCHI:(that big teardrop)Uh..I'd..uh..like to but..uh..Oh, yeah!
I'm throwing a special 
breakfast for my new Sempai, Seion.
AEKA: And what does this sempai mean?
YOSHO: It's a term of respect of a senior friend of yours. It
truly is a great honor.
RYOKO: Oh, that's all? Now I wanna know-(watch alarm) Uh-oh Aeka!
We'd better get to work!
You know what Kiyone'll say if she gets there before us!
AEKA&RYOKO: Good-bye, Tenchi-sama! (as they both try to kiss him
he moves outta the way and
they wind up kissing each other)
AEKA:(blushing) I..uh..
RYOKO:(doing the same) Uhh...let's get to work.(they both leave)
SEION: See? Told ya it'a work. 
TENCHI: They looked like they enjoyed it (he thinks for a second
and then gets a nosebleed)
SEION: What are you thinking about, you hentai little monkey!
TENCHI: (to Seion) Is it normal for guys to fantisize about..you
know!
SEION: Two nekkid chicks all over each other. I do all the time.
'Cept in mine it's two
Mihoshi's fighting over me. And are you serious about this sempai
thing?
TENCHI: You can bet on it, Seion-sempai.

other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: We see Aeka planting a seed in the ground and watering it.
The ground begins to rumble 
and up from the ground sprouts Aeka's ship, Ryu-oh.
RANMA:(voice over) If your gonna plant a tree, plant a tree. But
if you want Okinomiyaki made
the way you like it, there's only one "U-chans."  "U-chans." Have
it your way.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Ken-oki, Ryo-oki and Tetin are all looking at a bag of
Shnookies with a little cabbit
(lets call it Chibi-oki) playing in the background
RYO-OKI: So, she got us Shnookies. Great.
TETIN: But these aren't just any Shnookies! These are brand new
Carrot Cake flavor!
KEN-OKI: But how do they taste?
RYO-OKI: How should I know? They're brand new.
TETIN: Why don't you try them?
KEN-OKI: And ruin my appitite? No way-- Hey back there! Would you
knock it off?
CHIBI-OKI: Miya!
TETIN: I thought I hid that thing!
RYO-OKI: Well, one of us will have to try them and--(We see
Sasami's feet come through the door)--Quick! Act like cabbits!
ANNONCER: SHNOOKIES! The number one snack food in the Galaxy!
RYO-OKI: Miya!
KEN-OKI: Chiao!
TETIN: Like, Yaow!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a buch of carrots slung over
Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: The flower shop. Kiyone, Aeka, and Ryoko are talking.
RYOKO: I can't belive I KISSED you.
AEKA: I can't belive we ENJOYED it.
KIYONE: What's the big deal? So you kissed each other. You'll
live.
AEKA: But you don't understand. This is very unusual for Jurian
women.
KIYONE: Quit crying about it! Besides, I've gone a lot further
with another woman and you 
don't see me complaining!
RYOKO: Just as I thought! You are a di-
AEKA: Ryoko! Such language! Besides, if Miss Kiyone were
a..um..(she turns red)..one of those
she wouldn't be trying..things...with Mr. Masaki.
KIYONE: And how come you always refer to Noboyuki as Mister! He
is Tenchi's father, ya know!
AEKA: But Tenchi is a Jurian Prince and Mr. Masaki isn't!
KIYONE: He married Princess Achika and is the father of her child
and by you law that does
qualify him as a member of YOUR royal family.
RYOKO: About this other woman. Who was she? And what did you two
do.
KIYONE: Well, she was an older classmate of mine back home. She
was what the earthlings call
a Sempai. And we did nothing serious we just-(the bell on the
door rings. When Kiyone turns around Ryoko and Aeka are gone)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Tenchi's room. Tenchi and Seion are assembling a sword
stand while Sasami looks on.
TENCHI: But I don't own a daisho and neither do you!
SEION: Well now you have and excuse to get one. Hand me that part
there, would you, Sasami?
SASAMI: Here you go!
(Meanwhile, downstairs, Nagi is watching "Japan's Most Wanted"
and taking down notes when
the two flower shop employees burst in and ask...)
RYOKO&AEKA: WHERE'S TENCHI?
NAGI: (she points in the general direction of the stairs) That
way! (the princess and the
pirate procede promptly and purposely up the stairs.) Let see
now. Happosai wanted for....
(Outside Tenchi's door stand Aek and Ryoko but we hear Seion,
Tenchi and Sasami's voices from
inside the room)
RYOKO: What do you hear, Aeka.
AEKA: Shhhhhh! I'm trying to find out
-SEION: If you don't hold still I can't put it in.
-TENCHI: Are you sure about this?
-SEION: Have you done this before?
-TENCHI: No.
-SEION: Then shut up and let me finish this!
-SASAMI: Here! Let me help!
AEKA: Oh no! They're letting Sasami watch! That does it! (Ryoko
and Aeka storm in) JUST WHAT
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, LORD TENCH?!(Aeka and Ryoko then see
what is really going on and
both turn red)
SEION: Well, we could be building a sword but I could be wrong.
TENCHI: What did you think we were doing?
AEKA: Well I....uh..
RYOKO: We thought that you two were..uh...
TENCHI: You two think that we were-
SEION:(speaking with a lisp) O my sstarss! They found out about
usss!
RYOKO: That's not funny!
SEION: Your right. It's not funny-IT'S HYSTERICAL! AH-HAHAHAHA!
And where did you get the idea
that we were doing any thing like that?
AEKA: Well, Kiyone said she did that with her Sempai so naturaly
we-
SEION: On our planet young women are taught love-making by older
friends! That's why their so
good at it!
RYOKO: And just who teaches the young men!
SEION: The same way we learn how to fight-you dive right in and
hope you survive. Only we
do it with those girls who already know what they're doing.
AEKA: That is so..so..BARBARIC! I can't stand these savage mating
customs! (she storms out)
SEION: That's it.
TENCHI: Where are you going, Seion?
SEION: I'm going to go kill the bitch!(He leaves)
TENCHI: Now wait a minute! (He goes after Seion) You can't kill a
member of the Royal Family!
(Ryoko, Sasami, and Tenchi dogpile him)
SEION: Aw c'mon! You got to kill one!
RYOKO: That's not the point!
SEION: Are YOU lecturing me on morality? What's a matter? 'Fraid
I'll kill yer girlfriend?
RYOKO: Yes I am-I mean I can't let you kill Aeka!
SEION: Somebody's gotta for the good of the Empire! Nuttin's
gonna stop this quest! (Just
then Mihoshi walks by in a thong bikini)
MIHOSHI: Oh, Seion dear! There you are! Would you be a darling
young man and put some suntan
oil on my back? I'm going out by the lake to sunbathe and I could
really use your help!
SEION:(with a bewitched look on his face) Whatever you say,
Miiioooshiiii! He-he! (he seemingly 
floats out after her) 
RYOKO: It seems Mihoshi isn't entirely useless after all!
(There's a "Knock-knock" at the door)
SASAMI: I'll get it!(She runs down the stairs and opens the door
to see Megumi standing there)
Oh, it's you Megumi! Kamidaki's hiding in the closet!
KAMADAKI:(from inside the closet)Oh no!
MEGUMI: Actually, Sasami, I came to see you!(She slyly walks over
to the closet door) I have a 
message for you from the Jurian ship Ramia.
SASAMI: That's mommy's ship! AEKA! I GOT A MEESAGE FROM MOMMY!
AEKA:(Coming out of the kitchen) From mother! Where?
SASAMI: It's right here!(giving Aeka a disapproving look) And
you're supposed to call her 
Mommy!
AEKA: Aren't we a little old for that? (As she begins to read the
letter we hear Misaki's voice
and see her picture)
MISAKI: Little Aeka! And My sweet Little Sammy,
	  How have you been? I heard all about 
	  What you did in defeting Kagato! I can't
	  to meet this adorable young man named
	  Tenchi I've heard so much about! And I'm 
	  just dying to meet the great Yosho! He 
	  looks handsome for a man his age! It's a
	  good thing that the Torabushi's and my 
	  personal Knights hid me from Kagato! I
	  guess he wasn't to concerned about me 
	  because I'm not a part of the direct 
	  bloodline. But you shouldn't worry too
	  much about me because I'll be arriving on 
	  Earth not long after you get this letter.
	  So have everything ready for my arrival.
	  The local Galaxy Police will give you the
	  exact date of my arrival. Until then I'll
	  be counting the days until we're reunited!
					Love with hugs'n kisses
					Your Mommy.
AEKA: She's coming here? (Aeka faints)
SASAMI: Oh boy! Our Mommy's coming!
RYOKO: Aeka, you still call her "Mommy?" Ha HA!
(the phone rings and Nagi answers it)
NAGI: Hello? 
PHONE: DABLAHRANAYOUA RYOKO HASSABLASSA AEKA NOW!
NAGI: Ryoko, it's you boss!
RYOKO: Oh damn. We're in trouble!
AEKA:..uhnnnn...no Mommy...no Mommy...
(As the camera pulls away from the Masaki household we hear their
voices from inside the house)
RYOKO: Quit whinning, Aeka-sama and let's go!
AEKA: But why does she have to come?
TENCHI: So, Sasami, tell me about your mother!
SASAMI: Well, she's........
