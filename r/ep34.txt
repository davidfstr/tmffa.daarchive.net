CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Boku wa moto Pioneer" by Chisa Yokoyama(with much the same look as
OVA2 opening but including Kiyone, Seion, Demi, The Knights, Nagi, Misaki, Megumi and all
those adorable little cabbits.
SCENE: Tenchi's "REMODELED" Room (Ryoko and Aeka fixed it up like a Samurai's bedroom) It is
the morning after the events in Episode 33. Tenchi is lying in bed sandwitched in between
Ryoko and Aeka (yes, they are naked, but since the covers are pulled up you don't see anything)
Tenchi the takes a look at his watch. 09:55am!!!!
TENCHI: 09:55AM!!!! Uh-oh! I'M GONNA BE LATE! (with that he bolts outta bed and starts getting
dressed.)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 34: NO NEED FOR OLD TIMES!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TENCHI: (running down the stairs with one sock on and his shirt in his hand) SEION! (he trips
and tumbles down the five remaining stairs. Sasami pops her head out of the kitchen.)
SASAMI: Are you alright, Tenchi?
TENCHI: Yeah, I'm just fine. Where's Seion?
SASAMI: He left to go get a few things. He said it's for the carnival. He's doing a magic show!
TENCHI: And dad?
SASAMI: He left for work a couple of minutes ago.
TENCHI: (Looking quite upset) Great! There goes college for this year!(he looks at his watch)
09:57. The exam starts in three minutes. I'm not gonna make. Even Seion couldn't get me there
in time.
SASAMI: What about Washu? (With that BIG Washu comes out of the lab wearing only her labcoat)
WASHU: Hiyya Tenchi! Did you need something?
TENCHI: I need to get to my exam! Can you help?
WASHU: Not right now! Me and Asaka are still in the middle of a few experiments (smiles) You
know the type. Those dealing with reproduction and sex-
TENCHI: LOOK! I've got an exam in the next three minutes-
SASAMI: (Looking at his watch) Two minutes!
TENCHI: Two minutes! I need your help!
WASHU: Letsee. My choices are helping you get to your exam or my own physical pleasure? Hmmm
That's a toughy. But seeing as how I have altered time for you in the past 6 months and I
haven't had intercourse in SEVEN-HUNDRED YEARS, I think I'll go back and check up on Asaka!
Ta-ta! (She goes back into the lab)
TENCHI: I think I like Little Washu better!
WASHU: (from the lab) How'd you get in here?
MIHOSHI: (From the lab) Well, you see, I rolled outta bed this morning and wound up in here!
WASHU: (lab) Get out! And put this on! (Mihoshi walks out wearing Washu's labcoat.)
MIHOSHI: Oh, hi, Tenchi! Have you seen Seion? (as if on cue, two hands appear outta nowhere
and grab onto Mihoshi's ample bustline.)
SEION: Right behind you my dear! (She turns and kisses him.)
MIHOSHI: Did you get them?
SEION: Right here! (he hands her a box) I hope you can deal with the white tiger stripped
outfits.
MIHOSHI: Thanks! I'll just take 'em upstairs! (and she does)
TENCHI: SEION! What am I going to do? The exam starts in two minutes!
SASAMI: One minute!
TENCHI: One minute! Sasami, could you please go get Ryoko and Aeka up? I need to talk to
Seion for a minute! (Sasami heads up stair. When she's outta site, Tenchi starts talking)
My groin is killing me and my head feels like it got ran over by a dump truck!
SEION: Ain't it a great feeling though?
TENCHI: If it hadn't have been for Ryoko and Aeka, I'd be in that exam room by now! It's
their fault you know!
SEION: Now just a damn minute! You where the one putting your key in their locks! If
anybody is to blame it's you!
TENCHI: Yeah, I guess you're right! But it still doesn't solve the problem of me getting
to the exam!
SEION: Did you enjoy yourself last night?
TENCHI: (smiles) Well......
SEION: Then what are you so upset about? Take it next year! You'll pass! I know it!
(Just then Kiyone comes out dressed in a kimono)
KIYONE: Morning Tenchi! Seion! 
SEION: Don't you have to get dressed for work?
KIYONE: I already am! I just love these kimonos. And Noboyuki seems to love them.
TENCHI: I remember. Mom always used to wear'em too. That's the one Dad got you in Kyoto,
isn't it?
KIYONE: Yes it is. So what are you two talking about?
SEION: Well, it seems Tenchi here is no longer a stranger in the ways of the woman.
TENCHI: Seion...
KIYONE: Well, isn't that sweet? (she kisses him on the cheek)
TENCHI: But the question remains. What am I gonna do till the next exam cycle?
KIYONE: I think I can help you out with that!(the scene shifts to Tenchi in his working
fuku, a term that does NOT refer exclusivly to a high school girl's "sailor suit" uniform
but to ANY uniform. His uniform is a lot like what Yosho wears everyday except Tenchi's is
black and gray)
TENCHI: When do I get payed?
KIYONE: When you do 40 hours of work this week. Now start watering the rosebushes, please.
TENCHI: (sarcasticly) Yes, mom!
KIYONE: That sounds so nice. When I marry your father I'll have to insist that you call me
that.
(Ryoko and Aeka enter the scene)
RYOKO: Hello, Tenchi! How are you?
TENCHI: I'm working here now.
AEKA: Well, it looks like we'll all be working together as well as playing together. Oh-hohoho-
(She stops when she relizes that she said a very Ryokoish line) Wait a minute!(she pulls out
a script and reads it.) lesseehere.......That's my line alright. I have to talk to writer
about this.(She gives Mr. Stewart a dirty looks as he's writing this fic.)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The shop an hour later. Seion is waiting in a room in the back along with Demi and Nagi.
DEMI: So how long before he shows up?
SEION: Give him another five mintues. He'll be here.
NAGI: He'd better Or I'll-
MAN: Or you'll what, Nagisa? (they all turn to see Trakal. "But Mr. Stewart? Isn't he dead?"
Just shut up and read the fic)
NAGI: Jeeze. You're still alive. How nice.(note the sarcasm in her voice.
TRAKAL: It's nice to see you too.
SEION: Have a seat. (note the tension in his voice) So, Mr. Trakal, where have you been? I'm
dying to know. And so is the Grand Marshall.
TRAKAL: What's your problem, ol' buddy?
SEION: Don't ol' buddy me! Our friendship ended the day of the Orion Raid! You remember?
TRAKAL: That was thirty years ago!
SEION: WRONG! It was only two years ago! Or don't you remember? Let's just go over that little
incedent, shall we...............
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: GP Special Operations HQ. Two years ago. Special Operative 2nd Class Seion is at his
desk right across from SpecOP 2nd Class Demi's desk.
DEMI: Hey, Sei? You busy tonight?
SEION: Nope! What did you have in mind?
DEMI: Good Cop, Bad cop?
SEION: That's getting a little old. How bout we just do it the way your race does.
DEMI: Ooooo. "Nekojin style." It's a date. (Just then SpecOpSgt Trakal enters the room.)
SEION: Hey, Trakal. Whassup?
TRAKAL: You know, I'd appreciate an occasional salute! I am higher ranking and am afforded
one! (and with that Demi and Seion give him a half-assed salute.)
DEMI: There. That better?
TRAKAL: You two are setting a bad example for the rookie. 
SEION: What rookie?
TRAKAL: (he looks around and then pulls the rookie, Nagisa, into the room.) Meet our newest
SpecOp, Officer Nagisa.
NAGI: (in an unNagi-ishly perky voice) Good Afternoon, SpecOp 2 Makibi.
SEION: Cut it with the title crap! My first name's Seion, not SpecOp 2.
NAGI: (in her normal voice) Thank you! I hate using titles! Just call me Nagi.
DEMI: And I'm Demi! How are you doing?
NAGI: Fine. Is this what it's normaly like here?
SEION: Naw. We're usually not this busy! You get a room yet?
NAGI: Yeah, room 35a. It's supposed to be an apartment.
DEMI: It is, roomie! Let's get you moved in! (they leave)
TRAKAL: Just a little hint. Don't bring Demi by our room tonight. We got the Orion mission
tomorrow and I need sleep. We leave tomorrow...............
SEION: (voice over) And that's when it all started............
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
SCENE: Yosho and Sasami walk into a diner. Seion is behind the counter.
SEION: What can I get you, sweethart?
SASAMI: A Popsi, please!
SEION: Sorry, all we have is Coke.
YOSHO: Now you've done it!
SASAMI:(talking like Joe Peshi) You're sorry? I ordered a Popsi pal!
SEION: Look, I just though-
SASAMI: YOU THOUGHT? WHAT YOU REALLY THOUGH IS THAT I DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
COKE AND POPSI!
SEION: NOW LOOK HERE YOU LITTLE BRAT! ALL I GOT'S COKE! IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GO AHEAD AND BE 
THIRSTY! SEE IF I CARE!
SASAMI:(like Sammy again)........I'll take a coke then, sir.
YOSHO: I told you that doesn't work on Seion.
SASAMI: (Peshi voice again) Shove it, Grand-pa! (Sammi) I like this place!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE:The shop again. Ryoko and Aeka are arranging flowers while Tenchi is cleaning up.
RYOKO: So what's going on in there?
AEKA: I really don't know. It's none of our concern anyway.
RYOKO: Well, I'm gonna find out! (she procedes to the door. As she peeks in we see Seion,
Trakal, Demi and Nagi talking again.) That's the guy who....it can't be. Kain killed him.
SEION: Well, you didn't just have to lay there and watch us, Nagi! You could've said something!
NAGI: I wasn't watching! I was....never mind! 
SEION: Anyway......
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: 2 years ago. A GPSO Assault ship. There are about 25 SpecOps aboard.
SEION: You ready, Nagi?
NAGI: I did specialize in close combat at the academy. I think I can handle it.
TRAKAL: Well, this ain't no academy simulation! You have to be ready for anything! Like
this (he pulls out a knuckle-duster and tries to take a swing at Nagi, but unfortunatly
for Trakal his fist is caught in midswing by Seion and the DetSgt is accordingly thown
into the bulkhead)
SEION: Just make sure they don't have back-up, Traky ol' boy!
TRAKAL: Right! I'll do you for that!(Trakal mule-kicks Seion in the knee. With that a
fight breaks out. Demi and Nagi just sit there watching)
NAGI: Isn't somebody gonna stop them?
DEMI: Don't worry. They're just lettin' off a little steam. It'll end when Seion climbs
up on a box and does a Musau off of it.
NAGI: What's a Musau? (just then we see Seion climb on to a box, do a backflip off of it,
and land on a prone Trakal.) Ouch. That looked painful!(when Seion gets up, it appears
that Trakal's ribs are protruding from his chest, probably because they are.) OH MY GOD!
Look at what you did to him!
SEION: Yeah. And?
NAGI: HE COULD DIE!
TRAKAL: This? I've had worse! I can regenerate this in about 10 hours. I can regenerate a
limb in two days. And a hole new body in a week's time as long as my brain's still intact.
NAGI: And if it's not intact?
TRAKAL: I die.(he looks at his watch) We've got another 12 hours before we arrive. Until
then, You're free to do whatever.
SEION: Well, Demi, if we start now we can get about four hours of sleep, take a shower,
enjoy a leisurely meal, and still have two hours to check our equipment.
DEMI: I'm game if you are! (they both leave)
NAGI: Are those two dating or something?
TRAKAL: Naw. They just do that cause they both like it. They already agreed that this
was just for kicks. They are just really good friends. 
NAGI: I've never done that with my friends.
TRAKAL: You will soon. Everyone here has.
NAGI: How many of these women have been intimate with Seion. (with that, the seven other
pretty young ladies on the ship raise their hands.) Well, it's not gonna happen to me!
SEION: (voice-over) But it did two nights later!
NAGI: (voice-over) SHUT UP!(meanwhile, Ryoko and Aeka are peeking through the door)
RYOKO: Nagi was a cop? This is good!
AEKA: Why did she do that with someone like Seion? Take away his good looks, his perfect
physique, his winning smile, and his over-powering charm and what have you got? (as if
she just cued Tenchi, he walks in) 
TENCHI: What are you two doing? (cue the sweatdrops)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: Two years ago. The GPSO ship. About to launch the assault. Every one is in their
power armor (those things that Mihoshi used in TV Episodes 1 and 5) All the Armor is
tiger-striped.
TRAKAL: And in 3. 2. 1. Launch! (with that, all 25 power armor troops launch their assault
on the pirate asteriod. Explosions are everywhere! Pirate armor is being blasted before it
gets a chance to launch! In the heat of the battle, Seion gets an in coming transmission.)
SEION: What is it? (just then Mitsuki's face pops up on the screen)
MITSUKI: This is Detective 2nd Class Mitsuki. I'm the resident officer in this system!
You are not authorized to conduct operations in this system! Leave at once or I'll be
forced to take action!
SEION: BITE ME! I'm SpecOps! Take it up with SpecOps Marshall Kuramitsu! Good day! (he
shuts the screen off)
TRAKAL: We're in! (And the other 24 SpecOps follow him in. Within a few minutes they have
completely over-run the pirate base and captured all aboard it. Trakal goes down the line
and looks over the blind folded prisoners and points a few of them out.) You, you and you.
You have been convicted of the assassination of Emperor Azusa of Jurai! You killed 15
guards during your escape from the prison you where sent to. And that prison is in this
sector? What where you thinking? Troz? (A big cyclops looking guy steps forward)
TROZ: Yes, sir?
TRAKAL: Take these three into the next room and do the job you voluteered for.
TROZ: It shall be done, sir. (Troz leads them to the next room. Three laser blast are then
heard and the sound of three dead men hitting the deck soon follow. Troz walks back out)
The deed is done sir.
TRAKAL: Good. Go back to the ship and wait there.(Troz leaves) Now as for the rest of you.
We need to know where that neutron bomb is. Who ever fesses up gets to walk outta here! The
rest of you get to go to a subspace prison. It's your choice.
PIRATE CAPTAIN: Forget it! They ain't going to talk! My men are loyal only to me!(just then
Nagi and Demi walk in. They both have familiar looking cabbitens with them)
NAGI: The poor little things. They're half starved.
DEMI: Which one of you is smuggling these helpless little creatures? (one pirate raises his
hand and is instantly kicked in the groin) BASTARD! Take him outta here and lock him in a
cage! Only three of these little things survived.(one of the baby cabbits hops outta Nagi's
hand and makes it's way toward a young female pirate who is crying her eyes out. Seion goes
over to her.)
SEION: What's wrong young lady? (as the light falls on her we find out that it's Ryoko when
she was only 16)
RYOKO: (crying) I don't wanna die........
SEION: Do you know where the bomb is?
RYOKO: How do I know that you won't just lock me up after I tell you?
SEION: I give you my word as a Torabushi that you'll leave here a free woman.
RYOKO: It's on the forth planet of this system underneath the crater on the north pole.
SEION: And how do I know I can trust you?
RYOKO: It's my home planet.
SEION: How do I know you're not lying about that?
NAGI: She isn't.
RYOKO: Na-Nagisa? Is that you?
NAGI: Just trust her on this one, Seion. Please.
SEION: Alright. I feel she wouldn't lie about something this serious. Untie her. Take the rest
of these predetors to the ship.(so it was written. So it is done.)
TRAKAL: (to Seion) Nice going. Get her to reveal the location of the bomb and then arrest her
anyway. I couldn't have done it better myself.
SEION: It wasn't a trick.
TRAKAL: You mean you're gonna let one of the Ten most wanted go just like that?
SEION: Quit yer bitchin'! We got five of the other nine! 
TRAKAL: That's not the point! She is a wnated criminal!
SEION: She's just a kid! I'm not gonna send her to jail for seven hundred years for robbin'
a few banks! She has yet to even injure anyone!
TRAKAL: SHE IS THE ENEMY! ARREST HER NOW!
SEION: I will not follow that order!
TRAKAL: DO IT NOW!
SEION: I will NOT break my word!
TRAKAL: I SAID NOW!
SEION: I WILL NOT FOLLOW THAT ORDER! You wanna be a back stabbin' son of a bitch, FINE! You can
consider our friendship terminated! I'd like to know I could trust someone when he gives his
word. And you can't be trusted.
TRAKAL: FINE! I'll do it myself! (he pulls out his gun and procedes towards Ryoko)
NAGI: NOOOOO!! (She races towards Trakal and tackles him but he wrestles her to the ground and
points his gun at her head)
TRAKAL: You just assaulted a superior officer!(As he gets ready to srike her with the gun,
Seion delivers a convict kick to Trakal's head) 
SEION: No, just a higher ranking one! SpecOp Sgt Trakal, you are under arrest for attempted
murder of Officer Nagisa and Ryoko.
TRAKAL: You've got no proof.
DEMI: We've got what's in this camera! Or did youfor get that I do this for every mission?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The shop again.
TRAKAL: It was because of you that I wound up behind a desk!
SEION: Because of us? Last time I checked, YOU where the one who was trying to blast a hole in
Nagi's head! If anyone should be bitter, it's her! 
NAGI: Yeah. I was forced to leave after that. At least you got to stay in the GP.
TRAKAL: So is this why you called me here? To bash me?
DEMI: No. We came get your report on the Kain Incident. And to deliver this.(she hands him a
goldwatch.)For 40 years of service to the Galaxy Police. The Grand Marshall has promted you
to the rank of Sector Chief and has given you an honorable discharge and retirment pay. You
can go home now.
TRAKAL: I already am. Thank you. I'll be leaving now. My wife is waiting for me.
SEION: Trakal. I know you can be that cop that once inspired a rookie cop named Seion once
again.
TRAKAL: Thank you. I'll try. (He leaves)
DEMI: Well, I'd better get going too. Tentin is getting hungry and needs his food. BYE ALL!
(Demi leaves)
SEION: Well, it's almost closing time. 
NAGI: Your right. I gotta go cash in my bounty check before the bank closes.(as she walks out,
Ryoko is waiting outside the door)
RYOKO: How are you doing, sis? (Nagi responds with a sisterly hug on her sibling and then
leaves. Then Seion walks out to where Ryoko is) So, it was you.
SEION: Huh?
RYOKO: The cop who let me walk to get the bigger prize.
SEION: That's a classified mission. I don't know what you're talking about.
RYOKO: Of course you don't.(smiles and then kisses him on the cheek) Thank you. (She leaves.
Just then Tenchi appears behind Seion. He's standing on a box.)
TENCHI: Hey, Sempai.(as Seion turns around, Tenchi leaps of the box an executes a perfect
hurakanrana <another pro wrestling move> on his Sempai. As the scene shifts to the outside
of the building, we hear the rest of the dialogue as voice overs)
SEION: So, you think you're pretty good, eh? Well try this!(smack!)
TENCHI: That didn't hurt!(thud)
SEION: Is that the best you can do?(biff)
KIYONE: KNOCK IT OFF!(the sound of two coconuts bashing together)

Notes:
	1. To the fanfic writer Trakal: Don't Email me and tell me how inaccurately I portray
Trakal. He didn't even have 5 minutes of dialouge in the movie. And he was a few cards short
in his deck if he though he could take out Kain by himself. Ifurita is about the only anime
character I'd send up against him single handedly.
	2. Just who are all these new characters? If you haven't read the first few Eps do so
now.
	3. Visit my website at http://home.earthlink.net/~alliemae for website banners and more.
 	4. If you wanna know what Seion looks like, just let me know by Email and I can send you
a copy of his picture and his stats.
Seion can be reached at alliemae@mail.earthlink.net. Don't flame me or my fic. If you do you 
will get nuked back.
Smile for the nice people Sasami ----->  (^-^)
