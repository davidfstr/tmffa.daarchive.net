Chapter 5: Truth & Conclusion  
  
Ryoko: Should we continue to Megami, I think we already know Kiyone's 
answer. 
Tenchi: We should still see her mother, she has a right to know why she 
left Jurai, also we need to talk to her about those 2 light hawk wings 
as well. 
So, the ship made it's was to Megami, & Kiyone's answers to her tough 
questions! 
It took two more days to reach the Planet Megami, Kiyone's home planet. 
As they landed near Kiyone's parent's home, officials greeted the Jurai 
Empress, and the rest of Tenchi's gang. As they made their way towards 
Kiyone's mother's home, she saw a lone figure standing in front of the 
house , it was Kiyone's Mom Misato, dresses in traditional Jurai Robes. 
As greetings and introductions were exchanged, they all walked into the 
home. The house was a pleasantly decorated home ,not too big or too 
small. In it another figure was waiting for Kiyone; 
Kiyone: Kiro Hey Bro when did you get here? (Kiro is Kiyone's younger 
brother who is also a Galaxy Police officer) 
Kiro: (as she hugged her brother, she thought of her Friend Mihoshi, 
she knew that her brother had a crush on Mihoshi since they were kids, 
what a great opportunity for both of them, I'll talk to Tenchi and 
Ryoko, and see if this is a good idea, she said to herself.) 
After several minutes of conversations and catching up on each other's 
lives, Kiyone excused herself and her mother then moved to another room 
to talk. 
Kiyone: Mom, .... why did you not tell me I'm 1/2 Jurian? 
Misato: Oh Daughter, ...  I am sorry, but I left Jurai in defiance of 
my father. 
Kiyone: So, how did you defy him? 
Misato: I married you father! You see, I was a lady in waiting at the 
Royal court, and my father had already selected a Jurian Knight as my 
future husband (She then sighed, it was Sagami!!) 
Kiyone: (After a pause of realization) Does Ayeka know about this? 
Misato: I an sure she knew of this when she started becoming serious 
with Sagami, but he was first and foremost my friend. He knew that I 
had met this dashing GP officer and he knew of my feelings for him. 
Kiyone: So that's why you left Jurai? Did did Sagami help you? 
Misato: Yes, he's still a good friend, and an honorable man. 
Kiyone: Ok, I can then ask you this Mom, Tenchi has asked me to marry 
him! 
Misato: Oh, Are you sure about his, you would be his 2nd wife, you'd 
have to share his love with Ryoko. Concern for her daughter's feelings 
was all over her face. 
Kiyone: I already have, Mom. I love him and he loves me. I'm OK with 
Ryoko on this as well (Looking sincerely at her Mom) 
Misato: All right, then I am happy for you, my daughter a Princes of 
Jurai, I'd like to see my father's face now! 
Kiyone: Oh don't worry, you and he will be there for the wedding. I 
hope he accepts you now.  
Mom, there's something else I'd like to ask you, Tenchi and Ryoko told 
me that when I was knocked out back at the cave where we were attacked 
that I developed 2 light hawk wings, can you tell me if anyone on you 
side of the family had this happen before? 
Misato: Kiyone, you are a cousin to the Royal family, so you have royal 
blood, that should answer that question now. 
Kiyone: I do, then Kiro does too. Oh that's perfect. Mom did you know 
Kiro has had a crush on Mihoshi and.........

*************************** 
Jurai, 2 months later; 
As the time for the wedding approached, Kiyone was her nervous 
irascible self, yelling at Mihoshi, and fidgeting about everything. Her 
mother was there to comfort her, as well as her "sister" Ryoko. Lord 
Katsuhito was there to minister the wedding vows as well as the Royal 
Family and the rest of Tenchi's Family was there as well. Achika was 
now 2 months old and due to Megamian physiology was being nursed by  
both Ryoko and Kiyone. But today was Kiyone and Tenchi's day,  and all 
was ready when the wedding song was played. 
First came Sasami & Ryo-oki in child form, spreading Specially bred 
Green rose petals down the aisle. Then  came The Empress in her Royal 
robes, accompanied by her husband Prince Sagami. The came Ryoko 
accompanied by Tenchi's father Nobuyuki. Then came the maid of Honor 
and newly engaged Mihoshi and Kiro. Finally, there was Kiyone wearing 
her mother's Wedding Kimono, walking down the aisle, she turned towards 
her mother who had reconciled with her father, both were smiling and 
crying happy tears. As she made her way to the alter, she met Tenchi 
and she held his hand.  
As the ceremony concluded, all let out a cheer for the newest Mrs. 
Misaki and newest Princess of Jurai.  
The Kiyone and Tenchi made their way out to a new life & new 
adventures.  
   
  
Well that's it, Sorry about the somewhat lame ending, but I ran out of 
ideas. Unless someone can come up with another reason to continue.  I 
am writing another fic concerning our favorite Galaxy Police & Jurian 
knights. Hope you like this & my other fics <dennis_d@popmail.firn.edu>
