Note: Blah. I have nothing to say. Absolutely nothing interesting.
On to the fic..
******************************************************************************
Nat sighed a little cabbit sigh. This place was so beautiful. And, for that 
matter, was
Ryo-Ohki. Tenchi and Sasami were walking ahead with this cabbit, laughing 
occasionally. Soon Ryo-Ohki noticed the absence of Nat, and invited him 
over. He picked up the pace, allowing Sasami to scoop him up in her arms. He 
purred and settled on her shoulder. Then he gave a squeak of surprise and 
felt as if he were in heaven. Carrots! Carrots everywhere! Ryo-Ohki laughed 
and jumped ahead. He followed her. In one particular field, the human that 
had hung all over Tenchi when they had arrived was waiting. She smiled 
broadly when she saw Tenchi, and phased out.... Only to appear beside him.
	"Hi." She said cheerfully as she threw her arms around him. Tenchi 
sweat-dropped, and Sasami giggled.
	"Um, Ryoko, you promised to let go of me."
	"No I didn't."
	"That's true. She didn't Tenchi!" Sasami called out gleefully, seeing 
Tenchi begin to blush.
	Nat cocked his head. This was strange. This female obviously had feeling 
for him, but instead of grooming him or nuzzling him, she was squeezing him.
"*What's she doing?*"  (Something between *'s means it's a translation.) He 
asked.
"*It's a two-legger custom. If you love someone, you squeeze them, I 
think.*" Ryo-Ohki replied.
Nat didn't understand this. He moved to a carrot and sniffed it. It smelled 
good, to him at least.
"Here." Said Sasami, pulling it out and handing it to him.
"Miyaaaa!" he thanked her, embracing the carrot and gazing up at her 
adoringly. Sasami laughed and went into the shed at the far end of the field 
to get some baskets. Ryoko waited until she was inside the shed, and then 
she faced Tenchi.
"She's not watching, Tenchi.." she murmured into his ear, licking it. This 
had some effect on Tenchi, as he began to nosebleed.
Nat continued to eat his carrot, watching with interest.
"*She does this all the time.*" Ryo-Ohki said, digging a carrot out from the 
ground.
"Ryoko please!"
"Please what?"
"GET OFF!"
"Oh, now you know you don't mean that!"
"Yes! Sasami's coming, GET OFF!"
Ryoko made a face and phased out. Tenchi muttered something.
"Where did Ryoko go?" asked Sasami, handing Tenchi a basket. Tenchi 
shrugged. Sasami set her basket down and went back into the shed to put the 
extra basket up. A pair of arms seized Tenchi from behind.
"I'll be baaaack.." Ryoko whispered, and phased out once more. Sasami 
returned, and the humans began to pluck out carrots.

	"Ugh. I think I'm traumatized." Ariac sighed as she plopped down on the 
couch in the living room. Kiyone and Ayeka were with her, and Mihoshi was 
asleep again on the porch. A cartoon with strange monsters jumping from 
white-and-red balls and battling other monsters was on. Tsaraara walked out 
of Washu's lab and sat down beside the trio.
"So, whatcha doin'?" she asked, leaning forward slightly. Kiyone shrugged. 
Ayeka stood.
"As my duty as the royal princess of Jurai, I must go protect Tenchi Masaki 
from that monster Ryoko!" a swift breeze blew by outside.
"What does you being princess have to do with Tenchi?" Ariac asked. Ayeka 
fell down. Tsaraara, however, stared intently at the princess. She seemed to 
be about to say something, but she was interrupted.
"Ya know, princess, you really shouldn't poke you nose in my business. 'S 
not very 'proper' of you." Ryoko said as she phased into the room and landed 
behind Ayeka. Ayeka immediately got up. At this Tsaraara jumped from her 
seat with a cry.
"Ryoko?! You're here?!" she cried incredulously. Her face was a mask of 
disbelief.
"In the flesh. Why?" she added, starting to feel suspicious.
Tsaraara smirked coldly. From one of the many elaborate folds of her cloak 
she draw an oval-shaped gem. She tossed it into the air, and it hung there, 
level with her face. For a moment nothing happened. Then, suddenly, it grew 
small spikes. Eight, to be exact; there were three on each side, one on the 
top and one on the bottom. Ryoko laughed mockingly.
"Oh, no, she's gonna throw it at me and spike me to death!"
Tsaraara grinned, her face still unmerciful. The spike on the bottom shot 
outward jerkily, and stopped when it was big enough for a sword hilt. The 
point of it sunk inwards, both dulling the protrusion and making it wider. 
The three spikes on either side also shot out, splaying in a triangular 
formation. The points on here did not change. Finally, the top spike grew 
smoothly, almost slowly, flattening slightly and sharpening on all sides. 
The finished sword was an ice-blue color, with the red gem in the center. 
Tsaraara grabbed the handle, holding it as if it were as light as a feather.
"I don't know if I mentioned this, but I'm a bounty hunter. I've been 
offered a generous fee for a certain space pirate." She took a fighting 
stance, and black markings appeared on her face. Three pointed striped to 
each side. Ryoko took most of this in stride, but Ayeka gasped.
"Y..you're... from Jurai?" she asked, her voice quavering.
Tsaraara nodded grimly. "You could say that. You see, I'm considered a 
'mutant'." She spat the word "mutant" with a touch of venom in her voice. 
"If I had been given a natural birth, Nothing like this would ever happen! 
They knew what would happen! You bring this down upon yourself, pirate!" 
nobody understood what that meant, but Ryoko acted.
"If you want to fight me, I'm game." She said, forming her own energy sword. 
Ayeka sat down, subdued. Ariac was about to cry out with sudden realization 
that their living room was going to become a battleground, but Tsaraara 
yelled out and rushed Ryoko. The pirate grimaced and swung her weapon in a 
downward arc. Tsaraara swung her sword upward, blocking the thrust. Ryoko 
quickly slid her sword across Tsaraara's and stabbed. In the interval 
between the breakaway and the stab, The gem on the sword glowed. Ryoko found 
her sword stuck where it was. She couldn't move it. She cursed aloud and 
jumped back, avoiding the blue crystal of Tsaraara's sword. Gathering a ball 
of golden energy in one hand, she held it like a crystal ball. Suddenly, 
hundreds of miniature, bullet-like balls of energy shot out towards 
Tsaraara. She spun her sword, deflecting many and sending them into space... 
and into the walls. Everybody except Ryoko and Tsaraara sweat dropped, and 
the living room of the Masaki blew up.
