Chapter 6: Preparations

    Night fell on the Masaki residence. Their new guest had adjourned their
meeting to reflect on the previous conversation.  The inevitable fight with
Kel'Doran would occur soon, and their assault would surely fail without a
foolproof strategy.
    Ronin decided to retire to the outdoors.  In order to concentrate more
fully, he placed himself in a meditative trance and levitated over the lake
by the house.
    "Oooooomâ€¦.ooooommmmâ€¦."  I've got to be ready, he thought.  Only by
utilizing a perfect strategy can the daemon king be destroyed.  I was a
general in his army.  I should know him better than anyone.
    An idea struck him suddenly.  The plan would require calculation,
though.
 Nathan knew just who to ask.
    "Oh, Little Washu!!!"
______________________________________________________________________
"So," the genius scientist began.  "You say you need probability tests on
this plan of yours, huh?"
    "Precisely. For the most incredibly brilliant scientific mind in the
universe, it should be an easy task."
    Washu's robotic cheering section appeared.
    "Washu, you are brilliant!"
    "You are the greatest, Washu!"
    Washu's maniacal cackle cut through Nathan's head like a knife.  He put
on a mask of tolerance and continued.  "So, can you do this?"
    Washu smiled assuringly.  "Sure, sure.  Just sit in that chair over
there."
    Nathan did as Washu directed.  The short scientist walked over and
placed
a wired helmet on Nathan.  "This device will scan your mind and identify the
strengths and weaknesses of the plan." She explained.
    Closing his eyes, Nathan concentrated on his plan.  Various lights on
the
machine blinked on and off.  A confusing list of data appeared on the
monitor.
    Washu decided to show off her intellect.  "Now, according to this
monitor, your planâ€¦"
    Nathan interrupted.  "â€¦has a ninety-nine point eight seven chance of
success."
    Washu's jaw dropped.  "How did you read that data?  Only I, the
all-knowing Little Washu, should be able to!"
    The mysterious fighter simply smiled and replied, "Well, when you travel
as much as I do, you learn a few things."
    "Hmm, I see."
    Nathan glanced at the monitor.  "Can the machine suggest anything to
bring the probability to one-hundred percent?"
    "What?  The odds are already staggeringly in your favor."
    "Consider our opponent.  With Kel'Doran, you cannot take any chances."
    "Point taken."  Washu commenced typing at her console.  After a few
minutes, she looked over at Ronin and shook her head.  "According to this,
99.87% is the highest it can go.  We'll have to use the plan as it is."
    Nathan looked down.  "All right," he said after a long silence.  "Get
everyone together.  We'll need to get ready."
______________________________________________________________________
    Once again, the residents of the Masaki home gathered before Ronin.  He
had Washu design a holographic layout of their destination to more easily
convey his plan.  The young fighter explained his strategy to the group.
The
reactions were mixed.
    "So, let me get this straight," Ryoko began.  "You want to use Ryo-ohki
and Yagami to fly to this Kel'Doran guy's fortress and attack it?  Are you
out of your mind?"
    Nathan smiled.  "Perhaps. However, Kel'Doran will never suspect an
all-out attack.  He still thinks of me-and all of you-as weaklings.  If we
go
on the offensive, he'll be beaten by his own pride.  Now, listen carefully.
Here's the plan.
"First, we will set the Yagami on autopilot and program it to attack
Kel'Doran's fleet.  With the military forces distracted, we can use Ryo-ohki
to slip past the defenses and touch down next to Kel'Doran's stronghold.
Then you, Ryoko, will teleport us inside the walls of the fortress.  We will
then split up into two groups.  Tenchi and I will be the two strike force
leaders.
"Tenchi, your group will infiltrate the guard barracks here.  That is where
Kel'Doran's best fighters will be found at the time of our attack.
Therefore, Ryoko and Ayeka will both go with you.  Your job is to take out
Lich and Rath, Kel'Doran's top two warriors.  Ryoko's offensive power and
Ayeka's defensive power will be instrumental to your success.  This mission
is vital, as the two generals will go immediately to Kel'Doran if they sense
he is being attacked.  Should they fight alongside their leader, our plan
will fail without a doubt."
Sasami's eyes brightened.  "So, am I gonna be in your group, Nathan?"
Nathan looked down at the young princess.  "Sasami, you know you're too
young
to be involved in this.  You'll have to sit this one out."
    Sasami made a small sound of disappointment and looked at the floor.
Ronin continued with his plan.  "My group will consist of Kiyone, Mihoshi,
and Washu.  We will have two objectives.  Our first destination is the
control room.  Mihoshi and Washu are to stay there.  Washu, you are to
implant a bug into the fortress's security systems.  Mihoshi, I'm entrusting
you with the task of standing guard and making sure nothing happens to
Washu."
The blonde officer gave a salute.  "Yes sir, Mr. Ronin sir!  You can count
on
me!"
Kiyone covered her face with one hand.  God, she thought.  I hope Nathan
knows what he's doing.
"Then, Kiyone and I will head to a special underground chamber in the
compound.  The chamber will be heavily guarded, and rightly so, for within
is
the very Mana Stream that Kel'Doran obtained his power from."
A gasp found its way across the assembled party.
Ayeka spoke first.  "What are you going to do there?  Don't tell me you plan
toâ€¦"
"â€¦tap into the Mana Stream.  That's exactly what I intend to do."
"But, are you sure you can handle the power?" Kiyone asked.
"I should be able to.  The Blades of Chaos and the Phoenix Blade were both
made from divine materials.  They are built to withstand power of
unfathomable magnitudes.  Now, once I tap into the Mana Stream, the power of
the Phoenix Blade will increase exponentially.  However, it will take time.
Kiyone, I need you to stay with me and stand guard, ok?"
"Of course."
"All right."  Nathan shifted the holographic image to accommodate the next
phase of the plan.  "When both strike forces complete their objectives, we
will rendezvous at this sector.  From there, we will move on to the throne
room, where we will face the Daemon King himself."
The divine warrior looked around at the shocked faces of his audience.  "I
know it's dangerous, but this is the best chance we have.  We must rid the
galaxy of the Damned Ones.  You must understand that."
Kiyone put a hand on his shoulder.  "We're with you, Nathan.  Just lead the
way.  When do we leave?"
"We will leave tomorrow morning at nine."  Nathan sighed.  "There is a good
chance one or more of us will be killed in the operation.  Spend this last
night on Earth as if it were the last night of your life.  That may very
well
be the case."  Nathan abruptly stood up.  "Good night, everyone."  He
levitated himself up and left the house through the skylight.
One by one, the assembled party broke up to retire for the night.  Kiyone
was
the last to leave.  She looked up at the ceiling, where Nathan had exited
earlier.  After a moment's hesitation, she walked out into the back yard.
Kiyone walked along the yard until she reached the nearby lake.  She stood
at
the edge of the lake, staring off into the mountains beyond it.  Something
caught her eye up there.  Periodically, the pale moonlight would reflect off
a shiny red object.  Kiyone smiled.  She knew exactly where Nathan had
disappeared to.
    It took a while, but the young officer finally reached the top of the
mountain.  There, she saw a very discouraging sight.  Nathan had the Phoenix
Blade out, performing a frustrated version of a kata.  With each strike, he
would let out a yell of emotion.  She had been watching him for a while when
he finally noticed her.
    "What are you doing here?" he asked, sheathing the sword.
    "Couldn't sleep.  I assume you couldn't, either."
    Nathan simply nodded.
    Kiyone walked up to him.  "Are you having doubts?"
    "I shouldn't have come here.  I'm putting all of you in danger.  I don't
know what the hell I was thinking."
    "Hey.  You saved my life back on the cargo ship.  And you saved all of
us
in the battle against Forscythe.  If it weren't for you, we'd all be dead.
Never doubt your importance to usâ€¦and to me."
    "What?"  Nathan looked down.  "Kiyone, this isn't the time."
    Kiyone grabbed Nathan and looked into his eyes.  "Nathan, you said to
spend tonight as if it were the last night of your life.  I can't go another
minute without letting you know-``
    "-that you love me.  Trust me, you'll get over it."
    "But I-!"
    "Stop it.  If you let your feelings get in the way of the operation,
we're all dead!"
    Kiyone's heart sank.  He doesn't love me.  "I was stupid to even think
for a second that you could feel!!!" she yelled.  Nathan was taken aback by
the sudden outburst.  He definitely didn't see what was coming next.  In one
swift motion, Kiyone brought her hand up, slapping Nathan harshly across the
face, then turned and ran back down the mountain path.
    Nathan stood there in shock, holding the red handprint on his cheek.
After a moment, he whispered into the night air, "Iâ€¦love you, tooâ€¦"
