PLEASE READ NO NEED FOR A TEST BEFORE READING THIS STORY. THANK YOU

A WEEK AFTER THE LAST STORY..

	Ayeka twirled her hair around her finger. Things were pretty boring back 
at the palace on Jurai. She felt she would rather be back on Earth fighting over 
Tenchi with Ryoko, but she knew she could never go back. She would have no one 
to fight with, or for. Tenchi had chosen Ryoko.
	"Ayeka? Princess Ayeka. Please reply!" A voice called to her from a large 
screen.
	The voice was familiar, and so was the appearance of the girl on the other 
end of the connection. The teal-haired galaxy officer and her partner looked at 
Ayeka with worried faces. "Why, hello Kiyone. What is going on?"
	Kiyone, even though very scared, for the Jurains, she kept a straight face 
as she explained, "Space Pirate Ryoko, she has just escaped from robbing a bank 
only a couple light years from Jurai, however, word has it she is heading your 
way. Witnesses say she was mumbling something about you taking 'him' away. I 
don't know anything more than that."
	Ayeka was silent for a moment so she could think about this. Ryoko mad at 
her for taking 'him' away? Who is 'he'? Shouldn't Ayeka be the one mad at her? 
She was the one who took Tenchi from her! "Who is 'he'?" Ayeka finally asked.
	"I'm sorry Ayeka, but I'm not sure. Witnesses say she did not say any name 
except for 'Ayeka'. Wait, Operative A is coming in, he may have some more clues, 
I'll let you know in a few minutes. Kiyone out."
	Ayeka watched the screen disappear into nowhere. This was strange, but she 
was actually quite pleased. Finally something exciting is about to happen around 
here! Plus, she can finally get rid of that Ryoko once and for all, then maybe 
Tenchi will change his mind about her!

	"One more please?" Noboyuki begged.
	"Dad, you already took 20 pictures!" Tenchi laughed. "Besides, we have 
reservations we can't be late for so we better be on our way okay?"
	"Oh man!" Noboyuki complained. He certainly seemed excited for his son 
being in a relationship.
	Washu and Tenchi, hand in hand, walked down a path through the woods 
towards the city. Tenchi wore a tux, which made him look really handsome. Washu 
wore a teal dress with a banana boat cut neckline and a gold chain necklace. 
Tenchi brought some extra tissues in case a nosebleed came on without warning.
	"Where are we going for dinner?" Washu asked.
	"I told you, it's a surprise!" Tenchi grinned.
	"Give me a hint!" Washu stammered.
	"Nope!" Tenchi laughed.
	"Awww!" Washu whined.
	They walked for another 15 minutes; Washu kept trying to get out the 
surprise from Tenchi but was unsuccessful. By then, the greatest scientist of 
the universe was stumped.
	"You will have to pay for stumping the greatest scientist genius in the 
universe!" Washu warned Tenchi with a playful grin.
	"Yea? How?" Tenchi stopped and looked at Washu.
	"You gotta kiss me!" Washu puckered up and Tenchi laughed again, but sure 
enough he kissed her.
	The two got to the entrance to a beautiful French restaurant.
	"Oh Tenchi! How romantic!" Washu exclaimed.
	Tenchi wrapped his arm around Washu as they walked it and were led to a 
booth in front of a window facing a small man-made but beautiful waterfall.
	"What would you like to drink?" A waiter asked in an obvious fake accent.
	"We'll take some champagne," Tenchi ordered.
	As the waiter walked away Washu whispered to Tenchi, "At these prices, 
you'd think they'd have waiters with REAL French accents!"
	Tenchi laughed at Washu's joke then looked at the menu. He placed his hand 
in his suit pocket feeling for a tiny cube-shaped object. Good, he thought. it's 
still there!
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	Ryoko, back to wearing her space pirate outfit, which was a bit too 
revealing, stared at the space in front of her.
	I wish Tenchi was here to watch this beautiful sky with me. It would be 
romantic! Ryoko thought. But no, he had to choose Ayeka! The little snobby 
princess! Maybe if I show him how much better I am, he'll leave her and choose 
me!
	Ryoko came closer to the galaxy planet Jurai was in, the entrance 
surrounded by Galaxy Police ships.
	"Damn!" Ryoko cursed. "How can I get passed all of these?"
	Ryoko laughed at her stupid question. She was Ryoko, the most powerful 
space pirate there was, so she claims. 
	If Ayeka saw her struggling now, she'd say "Ryoko, why don't you just try 
to seduce the police officers? It seemed to have such a LARGE reaction from 
Tenchi, maybe the galaxy police will try to run away from you too!"
	Ohhh! Now she wanted to kill that princess more than ever. She sped up her 
speed and zoomed past the galaxy police before they could stop her.
	I'm almost there Ayeka! Say your prayers tonight, because you'll need a 
miracle to survive!
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	"Ayeka, we got some updated information," Kiyone announced. "It's said 
that Ryoko is now in the galaxy. She somehow got past the Galaxy police! We are 
on our way to help in her capture!"
	Kiyone looked over her shoulder at her partner who was drooling on her 
shoulder.
	"Mihoshi! Wake up!" Kiyone shook Mihoshi awake.
	"Wha? Hey! Why do you always need me when I'm taking a nap?" Mihoshi 
cried.
	"Because you are ALWAYS taking a nap!" Kiyone snapped.
	Mihoshi sat up and straightened her police uniform as well as she could, 
"aw, my uniform is all wrinkled" Mihoshi felt her shoulder which was damp from 
her saliva. "Ew, and it's wet!"
	Kiyone rolled her eyes, "That's what you get for sleeping on the job."
	The Yagami flew closer to Jurai and the two girls looked for a large 
section of cleared off land where they could park the Yagami.
	As they lowered onto the planet's surface someone fired at the ship 
causing Kiyone and Mihoshi to fly across the room.
	"What the!" Kiyone looked around to see the ship Ryo-oh-ki behind them.
	It was Ryoko!
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	The waiter with the phony accent began to clear the table and Tenchi 
waited patiently for the check.
	"Thank you Tenchi, this was wonderful," Washu smiled.
	"It's not over yet," Tenchi quickly answered.
	"Oh?"
	The check arrived and Tenchi placed the cash on the table enough to pay 
for the meal and a very generous tip. Washu and Tenchi walked out of the 
restaurant leaving a VERY pleased waiter behind.
	Tenchi wrapped his hand around Washu's neck. "Would you like to see a 
movie?"
	"Dinner and a movie? Boy, you may not ask a girl out often, but when you 
do, you sure spoil her!" Washu giggled.
	"I resent that," Tenchi said playfully.
	
	After the movie, Tenchi took her to the park and sat her down on the 
bench.
	"Washu, the last few days have been so wonderful, and I, would love to 
have many days like this in the future, where you and me hang out, at a 
restaurant, movie, park, wherever. I just know I want to spend everyday with 
you. W-will you marry me?"
	Washu's eyes brightened as Tenchi took a tiny velvet box from his suit 
pocket and opened it. Inside was a golden right with a ruby in the center and 
two diamond on either side.
	"Oh it's beautiful Tenchi!" Washu exclaimed.
	"It's a beautiful shade - identical to your hair," Tenchi smiled and he 
slid the ring on her finger,
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	"Ryoko!" Ayeka ran out of the palace towards the Yagami and Ryo-oh-ki. 
"What do you want from me?"
	"You know well what I want!" Ryoko snapped.
	"Then you must give me what I want," Ayeka folded her arms.
	"What is it you want then?" They both asked. "Tenchi!"
	Ryoko and Ayeka jumped back. "What?! Why on earth are you asking me for 
Tenchi? He told me he married you!" Ryoko spat.
	"Tenchi told me he loved you!" Ayeka yelled.
	"Yea, he said the same to us," Mihoshi said.
	"WHAT?!" Kiyone, Ayeka, and Ryoko screamed in horror. 
"TENCHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
~*

	"Dad, meet your daughter-in-law!" Tenchi said proudly as Washu and he 
walked through the door.
	"Oh my! Tenchi! I'm so proud of you!" Noboyuki ran up to hug his son and 
his fianc‚e. "When's the big day?"
	"Well, Tenchi and I talked about it and we thought this evening. Nothing 
big and fancy, just a small ceremony on the beach with you, Yosho and us." Washu 
explained.
	"Wow, how on earth did you get lucky enough to get married so soon?" Yosho 
asked.
	"Well, when I proposed to Washu, a priest overheard and offered to wed us. 
When he heard we only were expecting 2 guests, he said that tonight was open." 
Tenchi beamed.
	"We better get ready!" Noboyuki and Yosho ran to get dressed.
	"One thing, are you going to wear a wedding dress? You didn't get a chance 
to buy one," Tenchi asked.
	"Tenchi, I'm the greatest scientific genius. I can make one in minutes!" 
Washu smiled. "Do you want me to wear one?"
	Tenchi shrugged, "Oh, I won't force you, but it's tradition..."
	Washu laughed and went into her lab to get started making her dress.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
~*

	"Why? Why did Tenchi lie to us?" Ayeka began to cry.
	"I'm not sure, but this means Tenchi isn't getting married!" Ryoko said 
excitedly. "Maybe one of us still has a chance!"
	"Does anyone know what happened to Washu? I haven't heard if Tenchi lied 
to her and how she reacted. I mean, it's only logical, if he asked everyone 
else," Kiyone assumed.
	"Wait a minute, maybe Tenchi was trying to get rid of us so we wouldn't 
interfere with Tenchi and Washu's wedding!" Ayeka screamed.
	"Whoa Missy! Keep you kimono on. You know Washu only liked Tenchi to bug 
us, sure she tried to seduce him the day we brought baby Taro home, but you saw 
how Tenchi reacted. He was scared! There's no way he'd like Washu now!"
	"Ryoko, you must remember, he was scared of you and Ayeka too. If you 
believe so much that he'd change his mind about either of you, how are you so 
sure he wouldn't for Washu?" Kiyone asked.
	"Because..." Ryoko began. "Because, Washu is Washu!"
	"She already has a husband!" Ayeka put her hands to her hips.
	"Ayeka, you know that that was over 20,000 years ago. It doesn't count 
anymore. Her husbands' parents made the divorce for them, and against their 
will. Washu had to move on," Kiyone smiled sympathetically at Ayeka.
	"Then let's go stop their wedding!" Ryoko and Ayeka ran towards the Ryo-
oh-ki.
	Kiyone sighed. Washu was her friend and wanted nothing to do with this, 
but before she knew it, she too was aboard, flying through space, destination: 
earth.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	The traditional tune of "Here comes the bride" played as Washu walked 
across the sandy shore towards Tenchi
	He smiled as she stood beside him.
	The priest began, "We are gathered here in holy matrimony..."
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
~*

	The Ryo-oh-ki landed near the beach where Washu and Tenchi were being wed.
	"Did I call it or what?" Ryoko said smugly.
	"No time for that Ryoko! We have a wedding to ruin!" Ayeka began to run 
towards the ceremony.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
~*

	Tenchi took Washu's hand as the priest continued, "Does anyone here have a 
reason these two should not be wed? Come out now or forever hold your peace."
	"WE DO!" Ryoko and Ayeka hollered from just yards away.
	"How on earth did they find out?" Tenchi exclaimed.
	Washu crept closer to Tenchi and he embraced her, "Don't let them kill me 
Tenchi!"
	Tenchi could see Washu was extremely worried, but he knew that things will 
work out. He loved Washu, and would not change his mind.
	"Tenchi! Why did you lie to us?!" Ayeka screamed in his face.
	Ryoko took out her sword and began to run towards Washu, "Washu, meet your 
doom for stealing Tenchi!"
	Tenchi stood in between Washu and Ryoko causing Ryoko to stop short, 
"Ryoko, Ayeka, I need to confess something. The last day was a test, to see who 
would respect me and trust me. Only Washu passed. Besides, I love her and she 
loves me. We have been very happy together the last few days and so we decided 
to spend the rest of our days together."
	Ryoko and Ayeka were on the verge of tears, "Tenchi..."
	"It's too late for me to change my mind. All I ask is you just let us 
continue. You never have to see either of us again. You may leave now if you 
wish. Just don't make this hard on me. We will get married no matter what."
	The girls knew Tenchi wouldn't change his mind and Kiyone ran over to the 
couple, "Congratulations!"
	The others decided not to be rude and joined in. Everyone watched as the 
ceremony continued...
	The priest turned to Tenchi.
	"I do."
	Then, he turned to Washu.
	"I do."
	"You may now kiss the bride!"
	Tenchi and Washu kissed.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

	"You know what Ryoko, this now makes Tenchi your DAD!" Washu laughed 
harshly.
	"Grr! You better not go to sleep tonight...you may want to stay awake so 
you can protect yourself!"
	"Ryoko!" Tenchi scolded. "That's no way to talk to your mother! Go sit in 
the corner!"
	"What?!" Ryoko's jaw dropped to the floor. The corner? How young did he 
think she was? She wasn't 2!
	Ayeka began to laugh at Ryoko, "yea, you need time to think about what you 
did. Shame shame shame. What a naughty little girl you are!"
	Ryoko couldn't take it and took her sword out once more, "Bring it on 
'sistah!'"
	
	Even with Washu and Tenchi married, everything seemed to be normal again. 
Sasami came after Kiyone and Mihoshi went back to get her. She cooked a 
wonderful meal for the newly weds. Ayeka and Ryoko fought, but now on different 
subjects, and Washu now had reasons to leave her lab, but things weren't normal 
for long...

	"Everyone, Tenchi and I have an announcement," Washu looked over at Tenchi 
to nodded which signaled her to continue. "Well, I'm pregnant."
	Everyone gapsed and Noboyuki jumped up and down, "Did you hear that 
Achika? We're grandparents!"
	Washu waited impatiently to continue, "And, Tenchi and I don't think we 
have enough room for another human being to stay here, let alone it will surely 
bother you all, being woken up by a baby crying and all."
	"What makes you say that?" Ryoko snapped.
	"Come on, do you remember why I was taking care of Taro? I found him 
unsupervised because some girls I know fell asleep!" Washu laughed.
	
	But somewhere, someone evil was laughing as well, "Washu, enjoy your 
little time with Tenchi! Once that baby is born, I'm gonna take them away! 
Muahahahaha!"
