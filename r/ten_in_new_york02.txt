[ At the Downtown Hotel, Queens, NY, NY, where we last left
everybody, they are waking up. ]
 
Braden: Good Morning.
 
Everyone else: Hi Braden.
 
Ryoko: Are we going to spend five years in this hotel?
 
Ayeka: I wouldn't mind that.
 
Braden: No
 
Braden: (Puts on his fake British accent) I say we rent a flat.
 
Ayeka: A what?
 
Braden: (normally) An apartment.
 
Ayeka: (Faints)
 
Ryoko: I wouldn't mind that.
 
Braden: I see why.
 
Ayeka: (Wakes up) Why don't we just rent a house?
 
Braden: We would, but I'm not driving all the way to Newark, that's
the next city over. 
 
Ayeka: There aren't any houses in New York City?
 
Braden: Yes but they are WAY to expensive. Besides, most of the
city is apartments.
 
Ayeka: Well its better than earthquakes.
 
Braden: <Next time don't tell her the pros and cons of California.

Mihoshi: So are we getting an apartment?
 
Braden: For 10th time YES
 
Mihoshi: Sorry. So are we getting an apartment?
 
Braden: Ok, you can help pick it out.
 
Mihoshi: Yay!
 
Ayeka: Braden, are you sure its going to be a big apartment?
 
Braden: Do I look like I can afford it? Yes. Are we getting it big? Yes.
 
Ayeka: Good
*******************************************************************
[At the girls and Braden's apartment #12 the next day]
 
Braden: We'll take it.
 
Agent: Good, I think you'll like it.
 
Ayeka: Its smaller than I thought.
 
Braden: This is one of the biggest apartments in the city. And why
do you wear Jurian clothing in New York.
 
Ayeka: I'm part of Jurian royalty .Why do you Americans go around in
those clothes?
 
Braden: Half the world looks like this.
 
Ayeka: Why do they do that?
 
Braden: You must have some strict clothing rules in you're house.
 
Ayeka: Yes, we do.
 
Braden: Welcome to America. You don't have to follow them here.
Your dad won't even notice.
 
Ayeka: Really?
 
Braden: Yeah, he doesn't have eyes in the back of his head.
He spends more time trying to keep the throne or, give it to someone
who is "worthy" of having the. And they force people to get married,
what's wrong with that law? Last year he tried to pull that stupid
trickery on you, here in America you ask not force.
 
Ayeka: Save the lecture for when he actually does come.
 
Braden: Good idea, the words will come right back to me when he
comes.
 
Ayeka: Good
