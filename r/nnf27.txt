NO NEED FOR A FANFICTION!
OUR PAGE OF FANFICTION

	This is our fanfiction, I hope you enjoy. But before you do
there are a few things that you need to know. First off, this
takes after the TV and not the OVA. Secondly, yes, TMIL did take
place, we just set it after Time and Space Adventures. We will be
putting things that happened in OVA into this Universe (who could
resist). Since the TV did not pick a girl for Tenchi, we felt as
though we had to. This will only be brought up once, unless we
need a fight for a little comedy relief ^.^; We made a few of our
own characters into the story, but they will not really mess with
the original story. This is one year after the Kagato incident,
so some things may have been changed a bit. *We also illustrated
the fan fic a little bit, and we hope it's not that bad.* There
is only two of us writing this (sorry, we both want some
credit!), and we are RL sisters. Were not the best writers (so
sue us were only 15), but I think this story went pretty well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	A young girl about Sasami's age, or maybe a bit older, sat
in a from alone. She sat in a hay chair, next to a table with
lots of treats on it. The gray-eyed girl looked down to her
picture she held in her shaking hands. In the picture there was a
child with freckles and two blue pig tails that came from each
side of her head. Next to her was herself, and on her lap was a
cat/rabbit like creature. A sparkling Tear-drop fell from her
cheek onto the picture. "Sasami.. you said we'd meet again." As
she held the picture the room darkened.
	Sasami giggled happily as she stuck the noodles in the large
bowl. Then she placed cups and chopsticks around her table
Ryo-Ohki following her every step.
	Soon everyone gathered at the table and the group began to
eat. They started their meal with, in unison, "BONEAPITE!"
	The pink-eyed girl cleaned the mess from the table. Tenchi
helped a bit. But his grandfather called and he had to leave. <Oh
well.> she thought <I really don't mind the work.>
	Tenchi sighed as he swept the walk  to the shrine. He sighed
louder as the wind blew, blowing the leaves back to there place
on the walk way.
	"Tenchi!" Yosho called his grandson. "Work harder!" He
sighed as he saw Tenchi's work.
	"Tenchi." A seductive voice called from behind.
	Tenchi held his breath. "Ryoko. I gotta finish cleaning the
shrine."
	"Come on Tenchi! I wanna play!" Ryoko smiled as she hung to
Tenchi.
	Tenchi narrowed his eyes and kept sweeping. He did his best
to ignore Ryoko.
	The young gray-eyed girl looked up suddenly. A blinding
light filled the dark room. An image approached the girl.
	"Mirei. my deer." Called a women's voice. It was warm and
gentle.
	"Who. are you?" Mirei called to the bright image.
	The image looked at her with arctic eyes, then looked down.
She closed her eyes as her wings spread across the large room. A
single feather fell to Mirei's feet.
	Mirei bent down and picked up the feather. She closed her
eyes, images and long forgotten memories flashes in her mind. She
opened her eyes quickly, looking at the figure. "MAMA!"
	Sasami giggled as she pulled the string and carrot along.
Ryo-Ohki was all for the game.
	"Miyaa!" The cabbit pounced once again. She was determined
to get that carrot.
	She suddenly stopped moving the carrot and string. The young
girl had a look of worry on her face. She quickly shook it off.
"It must be. nah!"
	Aeka sat quietly as she watched the sunset. "I wish Tenchi
was here with me, speaking of which, were is Tenchi?" Aeka stood
up and quickly began her search.
	Tears ran down Mirei's face. "MAMA!" She cried once again.
	The angel smiled to  her daughter. "You have regained your
warm feeling." She said quietly.
	Mirei simply nodded and let her mother continue. 
	"You have lost something. important." She smiled and bent
down next to her daughter. "You have lost. your way." She said as
she touched Mirei's forehead with her own.
	A warm feeling washed over Mirei. She felt loved, warm, and
finally with a family.
	Mirei's mother pulled away. "My child. you are finally.
whole." A single tear fell from her eye.
	"Mama, what are you talking about?" She asked confused.
	The angel smiled and kissed her on the forhead. "You will
know in time." She seemed more distant then before. "You may go
be with your friend, your new family." She gave her daughter an 
encouraging look.
	"MAMA! I wanna be with you! Your all I need." she began to
wipe her tears as they slid down her face.
	Mirei's mother shook her head. "It could never be. I am a
spirit. and you are now whole."
	Her eyes went wide when she heard her mothers last sentence.
She ran into her arms. "MAMA! Thank you so much!" she began
sobbing into her shoulder.
	Slowly the bright image departed, and it was dark again. She
was alone.
	Aeka fell through the woods, finally reaching the end. She
looked up too see the masaki household. Her hair was a mess.
Sticks and dirt fell with every step. It was fully dark now. She
stumbled in the door. "Where. is. Tenchi." Aeka gasped.
	Ryoko turned around to see the mess. "I don't.." She tried
to hold back her laughter, but couldn't contain it. She fell off
the couch laughing wildly. "Tenchi will love your new hair style
princess!" Ryoko laughed.
	Kiyoni poked her head through the kitchen door. "What's all
the noise?" She asked as she looked up. Her face became red as
she saw Aeka and fell back to the kitchen laughing.
	This made Ryoko laugh harder and only infuriated Aeka
further.
	Mihoshi appeared next to Kiyoni. "What's so funny?" she
asked her partner. She grabbed Mihoshi's head shoving it through
the door.
	Mihoshi's gaze met a dirt spot on the floor. "What's so
funny about a dirt spot?" Mihoshi asked as always, confused.
	Yes, Ryoko and Kiyoni were both laughing there asses off.
	Aeka ran up the stairs, truly embarrassed. She turned the
corner and suddenly hit something.
	"Miss Aeka, are you all right?" Tenchi asked as he wiped a
blotch of mud away from his face.
	The crown princess blushed a deep red. "I'm sorry lord
Tenchi." She mumbled as she brushed past him.
	Tenchi heard muffled giggling downstairs. He looked were
Aeka was, but the dirty princess was gone.
	Princess Aeka slipped into her room. She then brushed
herself off. "Stupid monster women." Mumbled Aeka as she changed
into her night clothes. "I need to go take a bath." She glanced
over to see her younger sister sound asleep. "Hmm. I'll go and
take a bath now." She slipped out again, this time to take a
bath.
	Sasami smiled in her sleep. A slight giggle escaped from her
throat.
	The bedroom mirror glow dimly as a silhouette slowly began
to fill it. The figure stepped through the mirror. The girl
looked back and wiped her tears away. "mama. I love you." She
whispered. To herself. She knelt down next to the small princess.
"Sasami, wake up!" She said smiling.
	Ryo-Ohki looked up from atop Sasami's stomach. "MIYAAA!!"
She cried excitedly as she jumped to Mirei's lap.
	Sasami stretched and rubbed her eyes as she yawned and sat
up. She looked over to her side. "MIREI!" she yelled as she
grabbed her friend for a tight hug. "I missed you so much!"
	Washu awoke as she lifted her head from the computer. "What
the hell are these energy reactions from Sasami's room?" Washu 
pondered as she got up and walked to the princess's room.
	Mirei told Sasami about what happened, and how she became
whole. At the end of the story she smiled brightly.
	The younger princess smiled at her friend warmly. "Your part
of our family now Mirei!" She giggled, then heard a knock at the
door and turned her head to see what it was.
	"May I come in?" Asked Washu before wandering in. she slid
open the door when she got the OK. "Sasami, are you." began
Washu, but then she saw Mirei. She bent down next to the girl.
The genius brought out an invention and it began beeping wildly.
	"Hello, my name is Mirei." She said as politely as she
could.
	"She's part of our family now! If it's OK with Tenchi
anyway." Sasami broke in after Mirei.
	"Hmm, your the same energy reaction as when we went. went on
that. GHOST SHIP!" Washu's eyes bugged out of her head 
	"I am whole now, you don't need to worry." Mirei told Washu
calmly.
	"Plus, she's my friend." Sasami added.
	"Miyaa!" cried Ryo-Ohki in agreement.
	"All right all right! I believe you!" Washu said putting her
hands up defensibly.
	The girls giggled a bit then looked at eachother.
	"Let's go ask!" Sasami smiled happily.
	They looked back to Washu, but she has already  disappeared.
	"Oh well. Sasami sighed. As she grabbed the other girl's
hand and ran.
	"Sasami!" Giggled Mirei as she was dragged by her friend.
	Tenchi sighed as he struggled at his homework. "I just can't
figure." he began when he heard a knocking at his door. "Come
in!"
	Sasami slid open the door and fell in Tenchi's room giggling
with another girl falling atop giggling also.
	He looked at the small pile made besides his door. "Not to
be rude, but, who are you?" Tenchi asked the other girl.
	Mirei sat up and bowed. "I am Mirei, the one from the ghost
ship."
	"GHOST SHIP?" Tenchi practically fell off his chair.
	"They all have the same reactions." Muttered Mirei under her
breath.
	Sasami laughed at her friends remark. "Can she be part of
our 'family' Tenchi?
	Tenchi though for a moment. "I don't see why not."
	Both girls jumped up and down. "YAY!" They shouted in
unison.
	An image appeared behind Tenchi. IT came close to him
slowly.
	Mirei looked up at Tenchi, about to say thank you when she
saw the cyan-hared goddess.
	"Huh?" Tenchi turned just in time.
	"Tenchi." a sexy women's voice called out to him.
	"Ryoko! Go to bed!" Tenchi sighed.
	"But Tenchi, that's so far away! Can I just sleep in yours?"
She cooed and rubbed her finger in a circular motion on his
chest.
	Tenchi didn't respond and instead turned to face the girls.
"Both of you better go to bed too." He said in a softer voice.
	Ryoko averted her attention from Tenchi when she noticed the
gray-eyed girl. "Who the hell are you?"
	Mirei sighed. "Ask Tenchi." she said as she left the room.
	Ryoko blinked, then Tenchi and Ryoko looked at each other.
	Sasami gave Mirei a futon and a pillow. Then she went to
bed.
	It was about midnight when Mirei woke. She glanced at the
other princess. She got up and walked to the window. She looked
at the starry sky. "Thank you mama." She said in a whispered to
the moon.
