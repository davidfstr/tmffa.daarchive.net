Shadow Of The Kutan Episode 5: Back On Earth

Sareno tumbled through the portal into his lab, landing heavily on his stomach as the door
behind him winked out of existence and it's molecules dispersed forever, it's connection
severed permanently.  The emergency portal he had constructed aboard the Soja II
operated sufficiently enough to shield him from the explosion of the stardrive, although the
shockwave which preceded the blast made his trip rather uncomfortable.  He groaned softly
before realizing that although he had multiple fractures in his ribs and probably had internal
injuries as well, which if not treated, would prematurely end his life in a few hours, he was
alive still and his plan had worked.  He wished that he could contact the Ryo-oki and tell
everyone, but he figured that he only had a few minutes of consciousness left before he fell
unconscious, which would lead to his death.  He slowly struggled to his feet, every step an
infinite amount of pain before reaching the medical tube he had set up in case of this
occurring.  He set it on automatic and entered it, not bothering to take off his clothing.  He
would sleep...yes.  Sleep and then when he woke up he would tell them
everything................and darkness overtook him.
_______________

The Ryo-oki landed and everyone was teleported out in silence.  Not much was spoken
during the trip back despite the fact that all felt they had something to say.  Washu walked
out ahead of everyone else towards the Masaki home.

"Little-Washu!  Wait a sec!" Tenchi called out after her, fearing for her safety and not knowing
if he should comfort her or not.

Washu composed herself into a shadow of her former self before asserting, "No Tenchi I'm
fine, but thank you for asking.   I have some work to catch up on maybe you'll stop by so I
can finally examine you for a bit." Although her words were playful, her tone was not.

Ryoko, hugged Tenchi despite the dirty look Aeka gave her, "Tenchi do you think we
should do something?"

"I don't know Ryoko, but perhaps we should leave her alone for a while.  I mean, how
would you deal with it if you lost someone you knew for thousands of years?"

Although her mental connection to her "mother" was tenuous at best for her and currently
completely blocked, Ryoko whispered to herself as she looked helplessly at the door to
Washu's lab, "I think she loved him." She tried to picture how she would feel if it had been
Tenchi, but the thought was to painful to even think of.

Before Aeka could say anything to Ryoko, Sasami hugged her, crying "This is awful Aeka! 
Washu's so sad and Sareno's gone!"

Aeka looked down on her sister, "It's ok Sasami.  At least no one else was killed.  It was a
noble sacrifice that Mr. Kadreth did.  I'm sure many would be proud of his actions..." she
looked down at her sister again before realizing the meaning of her statement...."no that's
stupid.  No one should have died.  Washu must feel terrible.  Sasami's right, this is horrible."

Yosho stood in silence, remembering an earlier conversation:

"I always believe in having multiple contingency plans in case something goes wrong.  That
way, it leaves my options open to achieve the best result."

"Is death an option?"

"It's always there, but usually it's not a preferred method as if you fail, you will 	never get
another chance.  If you try something else, you still have a chance of rectifying it later.  Odds
are not important as they can always be worked around 	if you think in four dimensions or
more."

Yosho wondered, "Four dimensions?....hmmm...I wonder what he was referring to? 
Sareno was a specialist in the field of utilizing and manipulating the region he and Washu
referred to as sub space.  Perhaps he was giving a little more insight into his plans than he
let on...." Yosho started, realizing the implications of his train of thought, before smiling, "I
think Washu will find a surprise for her in her lab."

Everyone turned towards him, `WHAT?" they said in unison.

Yosho just smiled, looking at the house as Tenchi grumbled, "How come he always knows
everything I don't?" 

He was rewarded by a "thwack" as a bokken struck him on the back of the head.  When he
looked up, he saw his grandfather still standing where he had been a few feet away, smiling
at him without any apparent weapon, "It's because I pay attention.  Now let's go home."

Washu walked into her lab, and sat at her usual spot in front of a window overlooking a
beautiful sunset before summoning her holo-computer.  "Well at least I can get back to work
without interruption."  She began to type before pausing.  She hit a few more keys before
summoning a picture of the area the battle had taken place.  She looked at the screen
before tears began to fall again.  Sobbing softly she didn't notice the hand that crept onto
her shoulder.

Her crying stopped as she tried to compose herself into her "professional attitude", "Please
go away Tenchi.  I think I want to be alone for a little while."

"I don't know why you're so upset.....I mean it was only a ship.  We can build another."

Washu's eyes widened as she froze in her seat, recognizing the voice.  She turned to face
the speaker but no one was there.  She shook her head, "Get a hold of yourself Washu. 
You're hallucinating now." Turning back to her computer, she saw, standing in front of her,
was a tired Sareno.

"Hi.  I was in the neighborhood again and just thought I'd stop by to say.....off!"

Washu embraced him, holding him tightly as if she thought he would disappear again and
fade away like so many others had in her life.

Sareno winced as his still bruised ribs hadn't completely healed, but he returned the hug
anyway.

He was surprised when Washu didn't break away and yell at him for not communicating the
Ryo-oki, but he was even more taken aback when she whispered, "Don't leave
me......ever again.  It's hard to find students who aren't afraid of me or insane." As Sareno
began to laugh at her joke on his earlier jest, for the second time that day, Washu began to
cry again, although for a different reason.
_______________

A few days later, Tenchi finally encountered Sareno alone, outside.  It was late into the night
and Sareno sat on a hill, gazing at the stars.  The young man sat down next to the young-
looking scientist.  

Sareno didn't look up at the newcomer, but held out a cup of warm sake which Tenchi
refused, "He escaped you know.  I know the blast reached into sub-space, but as I was
thrown into the portal, before it closed, I heard him say that he'd be back."

Tenchi looked at him, amazed, "You believe him?  Nothing could have survived that."

Sareno looked down at the ground and softly whispered, "I did."

Tenchi smiled, "Yeah, but you had a portal you knew you could duck into."

"I know, but he probably was thinking the same thing when he first stepped on board.  He
must have known that I had fail-safes and that I would never let him take the ship or me if I
could help it," Sareno paused, taking a sip of his drink before continuing, "He'll be back."

Tenchi looked up at the stars, "Yeah, but we'll be expecting him."

Shocked, Kadreth looked over, "You can't be serious.  You actually thought I was going to
stay and endanger you all again?"

Tenchi looked over at him, "It's ok," laughing, "this stuff happens all the time."

Smiling, Sareno agreed, "Yes I suppose it does."

Tenchi stood up, "Well I gotta get back to the house before the girls notice I'm gone and
snuck out or something."

"Tenchi?"
"Yeah?"
"Thank you....for everything."
"No problem."

Sareno turned his head to watch Tenchi head down the hill.  Looking back at the stars he
contemplated the last few weeks.  He never would have expected that Tyrolan would
have ambushed him on his way to find Washu, nor did he expect the warlord to find him so
quickly, especially after his transport ship was completely destroyed.  The Kutan were
obviously far more resourceful than he had initially suspected, which made them far more
dangerous.  He would have to be ready for anything.  He needed to get this over with
before the next semester began if he could help it. 

Sareno stood and began walking down the hill back towards the sub-space lab and the
special genius that resided in there. 
_______________

Tenchi began walking back, when suddenly he felt as if he wasn't alone.  "Hi Ryoko.  What
are you doing up so late?"

Ryoko appeared behind Tenchi, floating a foot off the ground, "I couldn't sleep, so I went
down to see if there were any household chores to be done."

Tenchi looked over incredulously before Ryoko started laughing, "Just kidding Tenchi".

"I thought so." Tenchi sighed cynically.

She sighed and landed next to him, walking at his pace, "The stars are certainly beautiful
tonight."

Tenchi looked up, "Yeah.  I guess they are."

"Tenchi?"

"Hmm?"

"I know I seem..." she paused, searching for the right word, "overbearing at times, but do
you think......?"

Tenchi stopped and looked up at the sky, softly grasping her hand.  

"I think the stars are beautiful Ryoko."

She former pirate smiled softly as she looked upwards with him.

_______________

Washu watched the potential development on her computer screen, laughing, "Well at least
Little-Ryoko is finally learning something from her mom."

"And what would that be?"

Startled, Washu nearly jumped out of her seat, "Stop sneaking up on me like that Kadreth!"

Sareno laughed, "After all this time it's good to know I can still get you every time."

Washu continued to stare at her screen, grinning evilly, "Well not every time."

Even though her face was not visible, Sareno sensed something in her tone which worried
him. 

Suddenly he felt the wind knocked out of him as a set of metal bands trapped his arms and
legs against a vertical examining table.  He attempted to shift out of the restraint, but found
himself unable to.

Washu stood and slowly walked over towards the trapped scientist, "Oh stop struggling. 
You promised to be my new guinea pig for a while remember?"

Sareno's face turned white, "What?  Let me go!  I'm going to get you for this Washu!"

Washu laughed insanely as she approached him, "Maybe later."

Sareno tried to think of a way out, but having used these tables before, he knew the only
way out was a password, as the restraints blocked all other powers, allowing the
examination of various races.

The table rotated and the male scientist found himself upside-down.  Washu bent down to
bring herself level with his face.  Sareno found that he couldn't think properly and remember
the emergency password as Washu's lips found his.

Shadow Of The Kutan Epilogue

On a distant planet, a dark figure sat, contemplating recent events.  The loss of the Soja II
was a definate setback, but the war was not lost yet.  The two princesses of Jurai were on
Earth away from the Jurai military.  This fact could quickly become a greater assest than any
warship in his conquest of Jurai and his revenge on the royal household.  Oh yes.  The
unjustly disgraced and forgotten general will have his vengence yet.

End Epilogue
_______________

Author's Notes: So the first installment is finally done.  I'm really flattered that you finished 
it. 
I think that after the end you can see that the Ryoko/Aeka competition and the jurai royalty
themes may come into play in the next section.  (I told all of you Aeka and Ryoko fans to
hold on) Actually the main three (Tenchi, Ryoko, Aeka) will be the large focus of the next
installment, although Washu, Sareno, Yosho, Mihoshi, Sasami, everyone's favorite cabbit,
and of course Noboyuki will be present.  Suggestions, comments?  Even though I'm not
the best writer, this will be continued simply because I like to do it.  The more emails I get,
however, the faster I will complete it though.  Later all.
