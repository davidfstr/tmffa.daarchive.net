	I remember....
Looking out my mother's spaceship, staring at the tiny points 
of light that seemed so far away. And how they glimmered against the 
soothing darkness. My mother's hands on my face, wiping away my 
tears. Telling me that everything would be all right. That daddy and 
Azura and Renal were with the gods now. And when we reached the 
super nova, and gazed at its bright glory, at the beauty of a new 
light to shine across the vast void...my hands began to glow, my 
cuts healed instantly, and my mind seemed to expand a thousand fold. 
My mother pulled her hand to her face. I could feel my hands 
burning. My brain seemed to seethe with energy. And that's when I 
heard it, my name, my true name calling out to me. And a light 
formed between my hands, and I could feel a kind of heat boiling up 
behind my eyes. It became so intense that I cried out. My mother 
tried to reach me, but she was forced back by the power, by the 
light. And the light grew and grew, and I was immersed in it. I felt 
myself expand. Not my actual body, but my spirit, my heart, my mind, 
my soul. I felt like a pale flower, being pried open by moonlight. I 
became more than I was, more than I ever could have been. And that's 
when the voice imbedded itself in my mind, and gave me my true name.
Destiny.

**************

"My little Rei. So small, so precious. No one is ever going to 
take you away from me..." Aeka whispered to the small bundle of pink 
silk she cradled in her arms. She remembered the first words the 
doctor uttered after her baby was born, "It's a princess." And when 
Aeka held her for the first time and whispered her blessing over the 
child's anxious face, she felt nothing but pure and absolute joy. 
Tenchi leaned over her and reached out his finger to the baby. She 
took it in her own tiny hand and grasped it. 
"Daddy's little 
girl...she's beautiful Aeka. Beyond words," He said softly. Tenchi 
turned and walked away from the sun-drenched room. He looked back at 
his wife and his child. Aeka practically shimmered with joy. His 
world was perfect. As he left he smiled and whispered to no one, 
"Beyond words..."

Aeka looked once again at her baby and smiled. She stood up and 
placed her in the crib, stroking her gently.

My world is perfect.

Suddenly the room was quiet and unbearably still. Her hands 
began to shake. She clutched at her heart, which was racing and 
burning. And suddenly, the voice she most feared entered her mind.

<Thought you could get rid of me, eh? Remember your birthday party? 
I told you. I was telling you but you wouldn't listen. Then you 
thought I was gone, that I had disappeared, but you were wrong.>

No...

<Thought that just because you were in your little dream world that 
I wouldn't find you huh?>

NO...

<Well guess what sweetie...>

....

<It's time to wake up.>

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

Aeka felt her pulse race as she grasped onto the cradle. The 
baby began crying. Aeka pulled herself up and reached for her 
daughter. Her vision was beginning to fade. She grasped for the 
crying baby and pulled her close to her. The world around them began 
to spin and her eyes became unfocused. She heard music somewhere and 
she thought she could hear Tenchi crying out to her. The music 
swirled around her, and she thought she could see stars. It was then 
that the voice whispered into her mind.

<Welcome home Aeka.>

Then she blacked out.

**************

Dead.

Dead.

Dead.
	
Kiyone hated that word. It was an ugly word. One that cut off 
your trail of thought, like a falling axe at the end of a sentence. 
He's dead. Kiyone ran through the forest, her legs bleeding, her 
heart racing. She didn't care that she didn't know where she was 
going. It didn't matter. He was dead. And nothing could make it any 
better.
She came to the middle of a large clearing. The grass was up to 
her ankles and felt cool and soft. She looked up to the sky, her 
chest heaving, her eyes burning. She let herself drop to the ground. 
Her knees hit the ground and she crouched over. Her hands tore at 
the grass and the tears flowed freely from her face. Her life was 
meaningless. One horrible failure after another.
"I'm disappointed in you Officer Kiyone."
"I'm afraid I have to demote you."
"What's wrong Kiyone?"
"Officer Mitsuki will be taking your place."
"Don't worry Kiyone."
"I don't love you."
She looked up at the sky and wondered how fate could be so 
cruel. She shouted out into the sky and screamed his name.

"Why?!"

...

"WHY?!"

...

"Didn't you know I LOVED HIM?! I love him..."

<Yes, I did know.>

"Tsunami?! Tsunami help me!! I know I'm not Juraian, but I know you 
exist. I know you're out there! Help me!! What does it mean?!! Why 
does every being in this universe have a purpose but me? Fate took 
him away from me, give him back!!"

<I cannot undo the past. And I am certainly not Fate.>

"But you're a goddess!! You hold life and death in your hands! You 
must do SOMETHING! Anything..."

<I am sorry.>

"Don't you know HOW?!" Kiyone screamed, waiting for an answer. Her 
tears streamed down her face. She bent down and closed her eyes, her 
heart tearing. Her tears fell to the ground, leaving nothing but a 
sudden emptyness inside.

<Kiyone... How...>

One drop.
<...can you...>

Two drops.

<...unring...>

Three drops.

<...a bell?>

**************

Everything around me is just falling apart. And I have no idea 
of what to do. It seems like no one needs my help. I don't know what 
to do. Sasami is so scared. And sad. Kiyone ran out when she told us 
that Emperor Azusa's ship was destroyed. I personally didn't really 
know him, but everyone is so sad. And I feel so awful. Where is 
Aeka? Where is Kiyone? Poor Tenchi. Poor Ryoko. Poor Sasami. Poor 
everyone. What is going to happen?
I walked up to the roof where I knew she would be. There she 
was. Her back was hunched over, and she was shaking. I walked up to 
her, trying not to slip on the roof tiles. "Ryoko?" I asked.

"...Mihoshi...leave me alone."

"But Ryoko I-wah!!" I was walking towards her when I slipped on 
a loose tile. I fell sliding towards the edge of the roof but a 
strong hand gripped mine. Ryoko looked into my eyes as she pulled me 
up. I sat down next to her after I struggled up. I wiped my hands on 
my pants and stared awkwardly at my feet.
"You know Ryoko, things can only get better."
"No they can't Mihoshi. They can only get worse..."
"That's not true Ryoko!" I looked to her, pleading for some 
kind of hope. "I mean, Washu's really smart and all, and of course 
Tsunami might be able to do something and..." I bit my lip. It did 
look pretty hopeless.

<What are you saying Mihoshi?! Where's your determination?!>

It left the moment Ms. Washu told us Tenchi was...dying.

<Look Mihoshi, you've all gone up against Kagato, Yuzuha... 
You're a Galaxy Police Officer for Tsunami's sake!>

...You're...you're right.

I put my hand on Ryoko's shoulder and gave her a hug. "Look 
Ryoko, no matter how bad things get, you can always have faith. 
Faith can get you through it."
Ryoko's eyes widened as she hugged me 
back. I released the hug and looked at Ryoko. I smiled my best smile 
and said cheerfully, "Besides, how could Tenchi leave you?"
Ryoko looked at me as if that was the last thing she expected 
me to know. Then she broke into a smile and laughed. "Yeah, Mihoshi, 
of course..."

**************

The symphony of Washu's lab hummed and rose and fell to the 
steady pulse of the electricity coursing through the machines that 
surrounded her. Her fingers were flying over the keyboard. Line 
after line of untranslatable scientific data flashed across the 
screen.
She turned and pressed a few keys. A long raised medical bed 
floated down. On it was a sleeping woman, barely covered by a thin 
flimsy mist-light cloth. Washu walked to the woman, observing her 
shrewdly through her brimmed spectacles. She pressed a few more 
buttons and a beam of green light passed over the woman, feeding 
information into Washu's holotop. Washu's eyes widened and she 
stared again at the woman. This time analyzing her with her eyes. 
She rubbed lightly just below the woman's neck, where her collarbone 
met. A small bump graced her fingers, and for the first time in a 
long time, Washu flinched. She decided to check her hunch and 
pressed just against the woman's wrist. Another bump. She checked 
the other wrist, another one. Her eyes narrowed as she turned back 
towards her computer and proceeded to open a file locked by barrier 
after barrier of computer data. She typed in seven passwords, let a 
machine give her a retina scan and finally she opened the file she 
had been waiting a year to open. Finally, she opened the file...

Netelae.

**************

I remember when I used to dream. In my dreams my Mom was still 
alive. We were a happy family. And it was just me, my Mom, my Dad, 
and Grandpa. And nothing in the world could've changed that. But 
after awhile, the dream did change. It became me, my Dad, my Mom, my 
Grandpa, Ryoko, Aeka, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Sasami, Washu, and Ryo-Ohki. 
And we were still happy. There were no fights, no horrible life-
threatening battles. Just peace. Complete and utter peace.

But we're not happy. And my mother is not alive. I'm dying, alone, 
constantly losing blood. Washu's droids keep coming in for 
transfusions. But I'm tired... So very tired... I just want to go to 
sleep. But I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes her face 
flashes before me. Her eyes. Her lips. I can't stand it. Then I see 
my mother. Her soft hair, her gentle eyes. Then Sasami. And I can't 
help but smile. And Aeka's kind eyes, so worried about me, caring 
for me. They all flash before me. All my memories, my dreams. Their 
faces. And then comes Tsunami. She is smiling at me. She is close, 
so very close. She's whispering something to me. But I can't hear. 
Only the rushing sound of gentle waters swirling in my head. And the 
last face flashes before me...it's a woman. She looks a bit like 
Tsunami. But she has light lavender hair; her face seems softer, 
like she's been crying. Her lips are light pink. She glows. Just 
below her neck is a gem, just like Ryoko's. Except the gem is an 
opal and glows softly. She is eerily beautiful. I can feel my ears 
burning. Then Ryoko's words echo in my mind and the woman's face 
fades away in a circle of mist. "I love you Tenchi."
I love you too.

**************

Sasami entered Washu's lab hesitantly. "Washu?" she called out 
into the darkness. Sasami walked quietly towards the massive data 
screens that were centered amongst the bulking machinery. Washu was 
there pacing along the side of a medical bed. Sasami called out 
quietly once again, "Washu-chan?" Washu jumped at the disturbance 
and quickly pressed several buttons on her holotop. The table 
disappeared as she turned to face her. Her gaze was one of 
disturbing annoyance. But when she saw the streaks of tears on 
Sasami's face, her expression softened.
She had to grow up so fast.

<Thank Tsunami for that.>

Be quiet Tokimi, I'm a little busy.

<You're just upset because I wouldn't tell you about the girl.>
Wouldn't you be?

<I don't understand you Washu. Your behavior is so erratic, so 
emotional. You make no sense.>

I don't understand you either. You're a cold, calculating, 
unbelievable bitch.

<Name-calling?>

Even geniuses get pissed.

Washu stared at the blank and open look on Sasami's face. She 
looked so much like Tsunami. Just younger. A flash suddenly went off 
in her mind.
I've seen this before. Her tears. Except it wasn't Sasami. It 
was Tsunami.

"Washu?"

"What is it Sasami?"

"Washu I...I-" Sasami broke down and began to sob. She latched 
onto the young scientist and cried onto her shoulder. She choked out 
a few muffled words as she cried on and on.

"Shhh...It's okay Sasami. It's okay..." Washu patted her on the 
back. The young girl continued to cry.

"Washu," she croaked, "...I...I've done something bad... So 
very bad..."

"Shh...shh...Sasami. You can tell me. It'll be all right and-"

"No!" Sasami exclaimed, "It's horrible. Washu I--"

Sasami was cut off as a glaring red light and several chibi-
Washu's popped out from nowhere and cried out in unison, "Tenchi! 
Tenchi! Tenchi!"

"I'm sorry Sasami. Tenchi needs more blood, I have to go..."
Washu ran towards the surrounding darkness and a seamless door 
suddenly appeared. Washu disappeared into the door and Sasami was 
left alone. "Washu, I killed my father..." she whispered hauntingly.

She sighed and walked towards Washu's holotop. She pressed a 
random key and suddenly the same med-bed she saw earlier appeared. 
On it was a young woman in her twenties. She had brown hair and 
American features. She was unconscious. Sasami's eyes widened as she 
heard Tsunami's voice whisper into her mind.

She's what?!

<Yes, she is one of them.>

Then Washu needs her memories back!

<...Maybe...>

Tsunami...you made me...you made me do those things. Help Washu 
understand. Help me understand.

<.......>

You know the consequences!! Your decision affects too many 
people!

<......Very well Sasami.>

Thank you Tsunami.

<The time has come.>

**************

I kept working at my computer. Poor Sasami. She came in here 
looking for support, for a little understanding. And all I gave her 
was time to live through this misery all by herself. I'm so selfish. 
My ambitions, my need to solve a scientific problem, these come 
before everything else. They come before my daughter, before Sasami, 
before anything. And now Tenchi is being "reformatted" and I can't 
figure out why! I sighed as I collapsed on the keyboard. I rubbed my 
temples and tried to figure out the problem set before me. She is a 
mystery to me. A question I have to answer.

Who is she?

<I told you I wouldn't tell you Washu. Not till you have done 
me a favor.>

You know I won't.

<You don't even know what I want to ask of you.>

I don't have to.

I sighed at the headache this extra presence in my mind was 
creating. I walked towards the woman's sleeping figure. I looked at 
my cute little cabbit wristwatch (property of Washu Inc., of course) 
and checked the time. It's already late. Damn. I guess I'll have to 
continue tomorrow.

What is she?

<You know the answer Washu.>

But she can't be! That's impossible.

<You should know by now Washu. Nothing is impossible.>

You realize what this means.

<Of course I do.>

I mentally sighed. Looks like I've got a lot of work to do.

**************
	
Tsunami sighed. She was tired of the music. She was tired of 
all the plans, all the worries. She was tired of everything. And all 
the sadness she was carrying welled up inside of her. And she cried. 
And even the teardrops sang. The rush of water from all the worlds 
joined in just one great chorus. And some deep part of her mind 
screamed at the music.

Stop!!!

STOP IT!!!!

I'M SICK OF IT!

ALL OF IT!!

Tsunami shivered as she looked down over the small blue-green 
planet that was Earth. The child inside of her was screaming at her 
insides. The child wasn't Tsunami, something before her. Like a wall 
with layer after layer of different color, telling a history. And 
all her layers were peeling away to reveal the small frightened 
child she thought she could never be again.
Sasami's emotions were stirring inside of her more and more 
each day. Such new feelings and senses. Things she could not handle 
all at once. They fed the tiny child, nourished it. And Tsunami 
could feel herself slipping away into Sasami. She didn't know who 
she would be afterwards. Tsunami or Sasami? Or was she to be both? 
Or a new person entirely? Tsunami felt afraid, another mortal 
emotion. Part of her, some deep sickening part of her, wished she 
had never saved Sasami at all.
She could feel the trees growing. Their constant chant echoing 
in her ears. The blood that coursed through them called out to her. 
And as she cried over the planet, a crystal clear tear fell from her 
face. She let it land on the tip of her finger. She stared at it. 
Observing it with her light and anxious pink eyes. She looked back 
down over the planet. She whispered softly as she let the single 
tear fall down into the darkness.

Forgive me.

**************

Washu slept. It was so nice sleeping. To actually let her mind 
wander. Instead of constantly thinking, solving, calculating, 
worrying. She had fallen asleep on top of her computer. She was 
dreaming about her family again. Her husband, her son, even Ryoko 
and Ryo-Ohki were there. And she was happy. Soon her ears began to 
tingle. A small drop of water landed on her forehead, it trickled 
down her face till it reached the bottom of her eyelid, falling like 
a tear. And then a rush of water came roaring in the back of her 
mind. She heard music. And what she saw...it frightened her. Images 
of herself. Older, with three small circles arranged in a triangle 
on her forehead. She saw Tsunami. She looked just as Sasami looked 
earlier, with tears down her face. She saw another woman. She looked 
strange. She spoke, but no words came. A tiny desperate voice 
whispered into her mind.

<That's Tokimi.>

Washu's mind suddenly woke up, drifting between the vision and 
reality.

<Sasami?>

<Yes.>

<Tsunami?>

<Yes.>

The images kept flashing before her. Of power, of unimaginable 
power. She felt as if she was a universe being born. A sudden rush 
of energy that expanded and expanded, until it reached its limits 
and enfolded unto itself, only to be born again and again. Her mind 
broke with the sounds of laughter, of tears. She saw so many faces. 
So many worlds. The Juraians. The Terrans. Every kind of species of 
life flashed before her.

<Sasami...what is this?>

<Your memories.>

<My memories? From what life? What time?>

<Long before this one.>

Suddenly bits and pieces of what appeared to be different 
worlds surrounded her. Different dimensions. Different realities. 
She searched through these too. She felt the dim heat of a dying 
sun, the rush of running up against the Galaxy Police, speeding away 
from a certain 20 to life sentence. She saw children being born, 
people dying. Stars, galaxies, planets, universes. She traveled the 
unimaginable web of time and space and reality. She searched through 
all possibilities, all the threads that were woven. 
And she knew in 
her heart of hearts that she was the weaver. She was the one who 
determined what changed the course of one universe. And what 
determined the fate of another. She wove the threads of fate that 
bound one person to another, the knots and strings that made up a 
person's soul and random possibility. Eternity passed by in the 
blink of an eye. Yet somehow seconds became days, minutes became 
years. Every time she spent in one mortal body seemed to tire her 
free and ever expanding soul.
The images kept flying. Her mind became overwhelmed. But a part 
of her was still stuck on her lab on Earth. Wondering the kinds of 
physical effects that this might have on her body.

<My brain might explode.>

She could feel Sasami smile.

 <No...this is your mind. It has nothing to do with your 
brain.>

They kept flying. Washu felt the cool rain after a dry white-
hot summer. The celebration and revelry in a defeated enemy. She saw 
the First King of Jurai as a child. Then at his coronation. She 
longed to go farther back. What came before Jurai? Then she saw it. 
A woman's face flashed before her. She had a kind expression, soft 
light pink eyes and light lavender hair. She could feel Sasami's 
approval at her discovery. Like a proud mother displaying the 
accomplishments of her daughter's first piano recital.

<You see?>

<Yes...and no.>

<All will come in time sister.>

<Wait, Sasami, what did you call me?!>

Sasami did not answer. But Washu could feel her smirk. She 
could feel everything. It was amazing. It wasn't as if she had a 
body. It was if she was all bodies, all minds. But she could feel 
her body back on Earth calling her home.

<Sasami, I need to go back.>

<Very well Washu. You need only see one more thing.>

They came to a small planet. It was a brownish-red, like earth 
dipped in rust. Down beyond the planet's hazy atmosphere was a small 
village. It was very primitive. But it was quaint, and simple. They 
came to a house just beyond the edge of the town. In the house was a 
woman. She had long cyan hair and bright blue eyes. She turned and 
looked straight at Washu. Her mind flinched. She had been given a 
form. Next to her were two other girls. One was very small, and 
young. She had light brown hair and a smiling face. The other was 
sitting, reading a data pad. She looked cross and covered her face. 
Suddenly the door to the house opened. A tall man came through. He 
had sandy blonde hair and bright green eyes. Washu felt a familiar 
tingle in her stomach of whose eyes looked like that. The man picked 
her up and kissed her on the cheek. He smelled of dirt. Of fresh 
earth and sweat. But he also had a pleasant smell. One of spices and 
clear water. He put her down and walked over to the woman with cyan 
hair. He kissed her on the cheek and she blushed and giggled, just 
like a little girl.
Washu's nerves were hit as she looked to the young girl to her 
left, the one with brown hair. She looked into the smiling eyes of 
this little girl and felt her brain go into shock. She whispered to 
her in a child's voice, "Tsunami?" The girl giggled and looked at 
her older sister. "You're so silly Azura," she answered. Washu 
turned to her right and looked at the girl reading. She cleared her 
throat and asked in a quiet voice, "Tokimi?" The girl looked up at 
her. She was the same blonde as her father, except she had beautiful 
violet eyes. They weren't as beautiful as they should have been 
because she was looking at her younger sibling in disapproval. "Stop 
talking nonsense. I'm trying to do my homework."
Washu blinked in amazement as she stared again at the woman 
preparing some kind of root for the boiling pot next to her. 
"...Mama?" she called out. Suddenly the woman turned and looked at 
her. She felt guilty as if she had done something wrong. The woman 
ran over to her and picked her up. "You spoke? ...Y-You spoke!! 
Jamus, come in here, Azura said 'mama'!!" The tall man came into the 
room and looked at his wife and little girl. Then he broke out into 
a smile and came over and hugged them both. Washu could hear her 
sisters whispering below them.
As if they had never heard her speak before Leta..." the cross 
girl said.
"They haven't Renal." said Leta.
Washu looked to the smiling couple who began prodding at her to 
say it again. Washu cleared her throat and once again uttered that 
simple word. "Mama?" They laughed and hugged her tighter. She felt a 
bit patronized but at the same time her heart was bursting with 
pride.
Suddenly she felt her real form tug at her again.

<Sasami?>

<It's time to go home Washu.>

She looked at her smiling parents. The joy on their faces. She 
whispered to them, tears forming in her eyes, "Mama...Papa..." She 
gave them one last hug as she felt herself melt away. And once again 
she was flying. Her mind zipped across time, past the star systems 
till it was finally back at the Masaki home on Earth. And there was 
her body, still asleep.
Washu woke up in a gasp of air. Tears were 
streaming down her face and her head was pounding. She kept gasping 
over and over again. She tilted her head up and looked to the 
darkness that was the seemingly never-ending ceiling of her lab. She 
whispered one final word into the darkness.

"Mama..."

**************

I was sitting on the grass staring at my feet. They were red 
and had little cuts. And I just kept thinking about the Academy, 
where I had been, where was I going, what it all meant to me.
I had kissed guys before. But they were sloppy and clumsy. Like they 
were trying every trick in the book without really knowing what they 
were doing. But when I met him...... We were young, we were walking 
together. Not to some particular destination, just wandering like we 
had all the time in the world. The tall, white, uniformed buildings 
loomed on either side of us. It was after our Galactic History class 
when he led me around the campus, asking me questions, hiding the 
real reason he dragged me out there. And when we stopped, it was 
only sunset, he took my hand.
That first time, I noticed how slender and soft his fingers 
were. And it was weird because we kept talking like it wasn't 
happening. Then he looked at me and told me I was "unconventionally 
beautiful". I didn't know what to make of that, so I just stroked 
his hand and leaned against him, breathing softly on his neck. I had 
no idea what I was doing. I was Kiyone Makibi, top honors, first in 
my class, work first, everything else had to take a number. But we 
just stayed like that, listening to our own thoughts. No words, just 
drinking the moment in as if it would be our last.
When I had to leave he asked if I would be okay. I said yes and 
he kissed me lightly just under my eye. On my cheekbone. He acted 
like he had done it on accident and he wouldn't look at me. Like it 
never happened. And when I was walking back to my dorm, I could 
still feel where he had kissed me. Like a tingling feeling. It 
didn't hurt. It was just there. And I wondered if real kisses felt 
like that afterwards.
And even now, staring at my red feet and the cool grass, I 
touch my cheek and wonder if real kisses feel like that.

**************

"Mihoshi, I have a favor to ask of you."

"What is it Ms. Washu?"

"..."

"Oh...OH!! Sorry, Little Washu!"

"Okay, I need you to head to the Galaxy Police Headquarters to 
get me some special information they have in their planetary 
database. I need information on the race of the Netelae. Look for it 
under any info on Jurai. Here is a high-density data crystal for you 
to download the information. Now listen closely Mihoshi, this has to 
be a covert operation. I can give you a fake ID to temporarily boost 
you rank high enough to get in, but you and Kiyone are on your own 
from there. Do you get it Mihoshi?"

"Um...no."

"Argh! Look, here is a data pad with your instructions. I'm 
giving you anything you might need. If you have any other questions 
just ask Kiyone okay?"

"Ask Kiyone, okay Little Washu!"

"Great."

"Now, um...what do I have to do again?"

**************

My eyelids fluttered. I looked up, my eyes heavy and filled 
with water. I saw only sky and grass. I slowly, achingly, pulled 
myself up. My wrists shook. I could feel my tendons quiver. Where 
was I? I stared at my slender pale fingers against the cool grass. 
My palms faced down to the ground. They looked like a pair of broken 
wings, desperately fluttering to get up and fly away from my body. 
My shoulders ached, my eyes ached, everything ached. I felt a little 
cry well up inside my chest and I only let it escape as a pitiful 
whimper past my lips.
I slowly turned my head to look around me as I pushed myself 
off the ground. I could do nothing but hold my aching chest. I felt 
so hollow inside, as if my insides were missing. The emptiness 
inside of me boiled up and only escaped my body as tears. I heard 
them plop to the ground, being soaked up by the earth. Where was I?
I looked around the clearing I was in. I knew I was searching 
for something but I couldn't remember what. My head was fuzzy and 
unsure. My ears perked up as a small wail came to my attention. It 
came from over there, the small patch of grass near the bush. I 
dragged myself to the sound, ignoring the numbing feeling in my 
legs. As I came closer, the cry lessened, as if it had expected my 
approach. It was a baby. It was very small. It was wrapped in pink 
silk with some sort of writing on it. It was a girl. I stared at her 
in amazement. She was beautiful. She looked like a lump of unformed 
clay, so delicate and soft. I felt that if I pressed my fingers to 
her face, they would leave an imprint. I couldn't remember ever 
seeing a baby before. I couldn't remember a lot. I gently reached my 
hand out to her. She took it and smiled, I couldn't help but smile 
back. There was a tag tied around her wrist. It said the name "Rei". 
At least I think it was her name. I sat on my knees and picked her 
up. She was so small and soft.
"Hello little Rei. Aren't you adorable? Well Rei, my name 
is..." I trailed off, my mind grasping for some kind of memory, my 
name, my age, where I was from, anything. But no. Only soft wisps of 
voices and faces. No real memory. I could remember how to speak, 
what was a baby, how to take care of one, and things like what are 
math and science. But no real memories from my own life. Who were my 
parents, was I married? I just stared at the small baby, as if to 
search for some kind of answer within her small and desperate 
features.

Who am I?

A woman's song pierced the silence. The darkness from heartbeat 
and heartbeat. Her voice filled the emptiness, it sung high and 
rich. What she expressed in her melody made it possible for one to 
almost see her, her mouth open wide and her lips full. The sadness 
hung around her eyes. Her eyes were black, shining like a bird's. 
She had a crow's eyes. And a beat pounded behind her song, a 
heartbeat that whispered between each treble in her voice. Her hair 
was jet black, her skin pale, like chalk and powder. She was like a 
bird, quick and piercing. Chaos had her form, her name. She existed 
outside space, outside time, where her counterparts could not reach 
her. She was the infinitum. She would call upon the players, waking 
them from their cosmic sleep. The game was not over. It was war. And 
she was always a creature of war. Forged in the blood of dying men, 
the flash of sun that raked across the lifted spears. She was a 
being that lived in war cries, in a soldier's song.
She could see them, feel them, watching them being born from 
nothingness. Like a swirl of dust that became a star. They were like 
twin stars, racing towards her outstretched arms, racing towards the 
blue planet. They passed her in a flash, and she closed her eyes and 
felt their energy, their excitement.

Choose. Choose a body. Choose well and choose wisely.

They twirled around her, chattering like sparks. They sped 
towards the planet, racing each other, eager to see who could fly 
through the world first.

Washu moved through her lab in a liquid haze. Her eyes glowing 
blue like two soft topaz coins, observing all that was set before 
her. Lines of white silk thread ran back and forth between the 
creatures floating in their tanks, staring with six, maybe seven 
eyes, silent in their gel-like contentment. They were creatures from 
different dimensions, they all had memories, experiences, as all 
beings with a brain do. Their lines of dimension crossed into 
nothingness. Worlds unopened lay in their minds, waiting to be 
unlocked by her silver touch. Washu passed her hands over them, 
letting her fingertips trail over the smooth glass, opening their 
minds a little wider. Peeking into the threads of light, watching 
the dusty worlds with a reproachful gaze. They flickered before her, 
some no longer real, nothing but an unformed mass of energy. Waiting 
for her sister's molding touch. And then beings would come, with 
hearts, spirits, and minds. And Washu would bind them together, tie 
them up and string them along the mortal coil, till their strings 
were cut and they would fall limp, like puppets to infinity.
She walked to her monitor, calling forth her holo-top, typing 
in faster than ever before, her fingers a blur as they flew across 
the keys. The world she saw now glowed a soft hazy blue, but she saw 
more than she ever did with her normal vision. The monitor split 
into several screens, dividing and dividing, drawing the information 
from her mind. They showed images, flashing. Dark worlds of eternal 
midnight, inhabited by people with blind eyes and chalky skin. Dusty 
planets with azure skies and tanned beings that sang bubbles of 
light. Universes, new and unformed, like raw clumps of clay.
The lines of what could have been. And as she continued to 
type, the images drew in, a single yellow star, a green and blue 
planet. A cluster of islands floating in a tranquil sea, a land of 
green and brown, a forest, a lake, a house. Achika Masaki, leading 
her seventeen year old son to a picnic, Nobuyuki and Katsuhito 
waiting, smiling. A young American girl and Tenchi, walking arm in 
arm under a tunnel of trees. A young girl with short cyan hair and 
dark ochre eyes, flying over a small town in the light of a sinking 
sun. She flashed over to other planets, a blue world. A young woman 
with teal hair, a small child playing at her feet, a man smiling 
next to her. A tanned woman with blonde hair stands next to them, 
her arm around a grinning young man, staring at a small woman with 
pink hair. Another world. A place of metal and smoke. A land of 
gray. A young man sits at a bar. He has cyan hair and yellow feline 
eyes. He sips at his drink. A tattoo marks his left hand. His eyes 
water from the dust smoke rising in the noisy room.
Washu's eyes fly 
over the screens, drinking in the images, feeding the information 
into her brain. The lines of light crossing and weaving tying into a 
vast infinite web of possibilities. Her eyes still glowed blue, 
glazed over, a small smile creeping across her face.

Washu?

<Yes Tsunami? Dear sister of mine, it's nice to know you're 
keeping busy.>

You know your purpose.

<I do, as you and Tokimi know yours. The old game is afoot.>

What do you plan to do?

<Explore.>

Author's Notes:
	Well, this chapter took awhile, but at least I have some sort 
of idea as to where the plot is going now.  Things are going to get 
weird folks, just make sure you keep track.  The next chapter will 
end the first story arc of the fic.  Then we’ll be diving into some 
new worlds, you won’t even believe it.
