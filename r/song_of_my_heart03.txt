Song of My Heart: Meeting

"You love HIM?!?!" cried Washu.
"SSSSHHH!! You want everyone to know?!?!" Ryoko said as she put her hand over 
Washu's mouth.
"Know what? about your little secret love?" Yugi said as she came down the 
stairs.
"H.. how do you know?" Ryoko asked, very  confused.
"I have phycic powers." Yugi said giggleing.
"Looks like everyone already knows Little Ryoko." Washu said, stressing the word 
'little'.
Ryoko gowled at Washu's remark. "Shut up Washu!"
"Hey now.. don't fight know one else knows....." Yugi said quietly.
"I hope not...." Ryoko said, embarrassment in her voice.
"Why did you go after him though? I know you love him, but he's evil!!" Washu 
said.
"I.... I think I can change him..... i dunno how, but I think I can...." Ryoko 
said, with hope in her voice.
"Well if anyone can, it's you Ryoko.... he and you have a bond...." Yugi said 
with a grin.
"Yugi and I will set up some time just for you and him!" Washu cried joyfully.
"Yea! up in the mountains, it'll be perfect!" Yugi cried with equal joy.
"Oh boy.. what am I getting myself into....." Ryoko sighed.

3 days later, hotsuma had fully recovered from his hit, and was up and walking, 
withought feeling like he had a hangover.
"Your finally awake!" Yugi said as she walked up to Hotsuma when he left the 
lab.
"um.. yea..." he replyed, not knowing what to say.
"Come on! I have plans for you!" Yugi replyed pulling Hotsuma out the door by 
the hand.
"Wait a sec what kind of plans?" Hotsuma asked nervously.
"You'll see!" said Yugi happily, she then teleported them both to a small cliff 
in the mountains, the exact place where he and Ryoko had met for the second 
time.
"Why are we here?" Hotsuma asked raising his eyebrow.
"Not we, you, now stay here! Someone will be with you shortly." Yugi said with a 
giggle, then disapeered.

"It's ready!!" Yugi cried as she ran into washu's lab.
"Great now go on Ryoko, don't be nervous, show Yugi your new look, just for 
Hotsuma!" Washu said as she pulled Ryoko out from behind a curtain.
Yugi's eyes fell upon Ryoko, wearing a floor leangth black dress, with short 
sleaves, then she noticed that ryoko was wearing the same lip stick she had been 
wearing on her and Tenchi's date, and her hair up in a bun.
"This is humiliateing!" Ryoko yelled blushing.
"Aw come on, just go! You look great!" Yugi said as she continued to look in aw 
at Ryoko.
"Fine..." Ryoko sighed as she teleported to the mountain.

Hotsuma leaned against a tree, starting to loose his patience. "Why the hell am 
i here?" he said when suddenly, Ryoko apeared.
With the sun shineing behind her she looked like an angel.  
"R..Ryoko... y...you look great..." Hotsuma stuttered as he looked in aw at her.
"You remember me. How touching!" Ryoko smiled.
She sat down leaning her back against a tree trunk, and Hotsuma sat down next to 
her.
"You havn't changed princess" Hotsuma said, emphasiseing the last word.
"Neither have you, pretty boy" she said, now it almost seemed a name calling 
contest.
"Don't start." said Hotsuma gently pressing his fingers against Ryoko's lips, 
causibg her to blush.
"Fine..." she said prettending to be stubborn.
Hotsuma smiled at her, and she smiled back,  there was good in there, somewhere, 
deep down, then she did something unexpected, she never knew why she did it but 
she leaned over put her arms around his neck and passionately kissed him.
