Lost souls: act 4: ameka the wildflower

Back? Thanks again! Oh and this one leans more to Ryoko and how she 
deals with it, so read on!


Ryoko flew over a large forest
^Why not there? ^
 <Ok>
She flew down to it and sat on a old tree stump and opened a pocket 
knife 
"Tenchi..." she said as she put it to her wrist and cut as deep as she 
could. Pain shot through her in a secant. She started to faint, the 
last thing she remembered was something tripping on her.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Ryoko woke up in a small room that only had the bed she was on and a 
desk with papers scattered on it
"Are you ok? You've been asleep for 8 months now" a young girl walked 
in holding a teapot. Her stomach looked a little puffy
 "I was worried you'd never wake up"
"Who are you?" Ryoko pulled the blanket closer 
"I'm Christina Campbell, but you can just call me Cc, what's your 
name?"
"Ryoko"
"I like that name, I wish I had know it when I found you"
"Where am I?"
"My house, I took you here when I tripped on you that day in the 
forest. I really had no idea why you where trying to kill your self 
till, well" she put her finger on Ryoko's now huge stomach "you 
shouldn't do that to your baby, I mean, If you need help raising it or 
you just can't ill take it, I love baby's"
"It wasn't about the baby" Ryoko pulled the blanket even closer as Cc 
put the tea pot down and pulled a cup from one of the many piles of 
paper 
"Then what was it about?"
"Nothing"
"Please tell me"
"It was about the baby's father"
"What happened?" Cc asked as she poured some tea into the cup
"Does it really matter?"
"Yes, it does. Trust me, you'll feel better once you tell someone"
"If you must know."

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

It was half an hour later and Ryoko had told Cc everything Cc said
"So, the whole time he was with that Aeka girl?"
"Yep, and I thought the whole time he loved me" Ryoko sounded sad  
"I'm really sorry"
"Oh, not like-OWWW!!!" Ryoko clenched her stomach
"Yes, yes, I knew this would happen soon" she walked over to ryoko

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two-hour's later

"Its ok now Ryoko, you can stop pushing, it's a girl" Cc said after a 
long time. She handed Ryoko the small crying baby. As soon as Ryoko 
picked her up she stop crying
"Shh, its ok now, you got your mommy, shh" it was amazing how good 
Ryoko was with her
"What are you going to name her?" Cc took the baby back and put her in 
some warm water that was next to the bed to clean her
"Uhhh" Ryoko couldn't think of anything, then she remembered one 
person, Achika because of her hair and eye's, she had long (like past 
her keens) black hair and eyes hat had the shape of Achika's and 
Tenchi's with her own gold color to them 
"Ameka" 
"That's a good name for her, ok then Ameka, back to your mom" Cc handed 
Ryoko the bundle of blanket's that was Ameka and left the room
"Shh, sleep now ok?" she kissed the baby's forehead and she started to 
fall asleep as Ryoko picked up a rubber band and put Ameka's hair up in 
a small ball with the rest of her hair coming out like Achika's did


It was about 5 years later, Ryoko had got a job singing at a very fancy 
restaurant and Cc baby-sat Ameka when Ryoko was at work and Ryoko 
watched Temp, Cc's son who was only a few month's younger then Ameka, 
when Cc was at her night job at the hospital. 
One day when it was Cc's tern to watch the kids Ameka ran off only to 
find the one her mom had been running from for year's and the one who 
thought both Ryoko and Ameka (thou he didn't know her name) where dead 
but was still waiting for Ryoko. Tenchi Masaki. Ameka ran to the near 
by blanket full of people and asked
"Do you know where my mom is?"
"Huh?" Tenchi looked down at the small child who was now crying
"Its ok little girl, we'll help you find your mom"
 "Yeah!" said a girl from behind him 
"We'll help ya!" said a boy about her age that had dark blue hair  
"That's Sasami and Mayki, them and the other's and I will help ya, now, 
what does she look like?"
"AMEKA!!!!!!!!COME BACK RIGHT NOW!!AMEKA!!!" yelled a voice from nearby 
"That's my aunt, I guess I have to go, bye!" she ran to the yelling 
women and the small boy that was with her.
"She looked like someone I know" Washu said under her breath


    
It was now 15 years since Ameka was born and something unbearable 
happened. Kaiun, Kain's son, showed up, wanting the "nova" as he called 
it, and the "nova" was Ameka.
"Come little princess, my little nova, if you come now ill leave your 
mother and friend's alone and mindless of you, " Kaiun said in a would-
be sweet voice
"Mom! What is he talking about?" Ameka yelled over the sound of wind 
sweeping by them 
"Nothing! Just leave! Go!" Ryoko yelled 
"Temp! Take Ameka up stares and lock your-selves in!" Cc yelled, and 
yes, Ryoko had told her every thing and yes, she has powers of jurai
"What's going on?!" Temp yelled
"GO!" both Ryoko and Cc yelled so they did, Temp grabbed Ameka by the 
arm and pulled her to her room up stares 
"Temp do you know what's happening?" Ameka asked 
"No, I wish I knew what this nova stuff was about thou"
"Same here" at that they heard a loud BAM! BOOM! Down stares "KI-TO-NI-
SI-TO!" they heard along with more BOOM's and BAG's 
"Temp" Ameka whispered as she hugged close to him. BOOM! The door fell 
to the floor. They saw the thing at the door holding both there 
mothers, who where covered in blood, and it said
"Ill leave you be for now, but Ill take these" he held up Ryoko and Cc 
higher for a secant but put them down and pointed a finger at them
"Ya know what? I think Ill have a little fun, Ill make it so only one 
of you remembers the other and what you are and one of you won't 
remember anything of any one but your mother and that she died last 
year and not of the other one" a small BOOM! Followed his word's and it 
was done. The last thing Ameka heard was 
"Ill be back for you, nova"


Like it? I told you it wasn't a Ryoko Tenchi story, and now we won't 
see too much of Ryoko, but she'll be there. And what does nova mean? 
Who is Temp and why is he part of Kaiun? Why is that Kaiun guy 
following Ameka? These and more in the next one
