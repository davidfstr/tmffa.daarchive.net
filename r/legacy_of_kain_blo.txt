The Legacy of Kain - The Outtakes
by Aaron Bastin - kakapo101@hotmail.com
synopsis:  Bloopers during the making of L of K.

Okay, yes, I know, I'm shamelessly ripping off this idea, but...I read the 
outtakes from Unfinished Business and couldn't stop laughing, so I thought, 
'what the hell' and threw this together...

Ch. 1
-----

Kevin:   I'm Kevin.  Kevin Walker.  I...uh...<heavy breathing>I am your 
father, Tenchi.

Tenchi:  <laughing>  Oh, come on...your first line?

Kevin:   Come over to the dark side...

Tenchi:  Quiet, you.

-----

Kevin:   Are the two of you...uh...

Tenchi:  Oh, yeah, I slept with her a few times.

Kevin:   <cracks up>

-----
Ch. 2
-----

Katsuhito:  You don't shay...you don't shay?  Why, no, oshiffer, I'm shober 
ash a judge...

Ch. 3
-----

Washu:    His pattern clearly shows the influence of a null-point energy 
source of null, er, kerfungabooboo.

Aaron:    All right, take a breather...

Washu:    Thank god.  <walking off camera>  Who comes up with this stuff, 
anyway?

Tenchi:   I hear they hired the guy who does technobabble for Star Trek.

Mihoshi:  Really?  Outstanding...

Ch. 4
-----

Ayeka:  Yes, Washu-chan.

<computer blows up>

Ayeka:  What in the hell was THAT?

Washu:  I dunno, but now I've forgotten my line.

Aaron:  Hey, Neil!  That thing's not scheduled to blow for at least eight 
more chapters!

-----

Ayeka:  Yes, Washu-chan.

Washu:  Good.  I...uh...damn!

Ayeka:  That computer thing really rattled you, huh?

Washu:  Line!

Ch. 5
-----

Kevin:  <speaks Kevin's Tale monologue>

Aaron:  Uhhh...Kev, we got the boom in the shot...can you do it over?

Kevin:  What?  Shit!

-----

Ayeka:  <slaps Kevin>

Kevin:  Ow.

Ayeka:  <laughing>  Jeez, I'm sorry...

-----

Kevin:  I'm not surprised you haven't heard of Larai Regus, Sasami - it's 
not there any more.  In the last days of the Rift the Jurai used a new 
weapon that made our sun go supernova.  Um...

Ayeka:  <pause>  Well, fuck them!

Ayeka:  Why, you...you...line!

Ryoko:  You line?

Kevin:  Be well, Ryoko.  <turns to leave, runs into closed door>  Ow...

Ryoko:  <cracks up>

Kevin:  Be well, Ryoko.

Ryoko:  <cracks up>  Sorry...

Kevin:  <rolls eyes>

Kevin:  Be -

Ryoko:  <loses it>

Kevin:  Stop that!

turns to the camera and grins>  Pretty neat stuff, huh?  Read the fic.

	video...blargh...

Ryoko:  Har har.

Hunter:  All right, Walker.  Come get me.

Kevin:  <Runs into room, slings Hunter over shoulder, and runs out>

Hunter:  <off-camera>  I didn't mean NOW, dammit!  <laughs>

-----

Kevin:  What was that?

Ryoko:  A plot device, I think.

Kevin:  <cracks up>
