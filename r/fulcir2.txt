				INTERLUDE
Establishing Shot: Darkness, then Fade in. Earth, the big round globe
hogging the entire view with only a boarder of black emptiness around it.
The view pans backwards and suddenly a hand engulfs the Earth and 
squeezes it until it shatters into huge asteroids.

Then Darkness again.  A young girl’s face (SASAMI) suddenly appears 
and her eyes shoot open, showing the pinkish hues beneath her lids.

				AZAKA (O.S.)
		Princess Sasami.

SASAMI turns her head, then sits up at the waist.  She is in a white 
colored capsule with its transparent lid hanging a few feet above her
head.  AZAKA, a columnar wooden servant is beside her.

				SASAMI
		What is it Azaka?

				AZAKA
		We are nearing a planet that Aeka 
		believes to be the one we are looking 
		for.  She is already out of Cryo-stasis 
		and is on the bridge.

SASAMI puts a hand to her head and shakes away the stasismares.

				SASAMI
		Alright Azaka, I’ll come to the bridge
		in a moment.

On the Bridge, AEKA is standing in front of a large tree looking into a
big screen.  KAMIDAKI is to her right performing scans on the planet.

				KAMIDAKI
		We are within full scanning range 
		Princess Aeka.

				AEKA
		Proceed with the scans, see if you 
		can find that scurvy wretch Ryouko

Various screens appear within the big one up in front, several things
are displayed on the smaller screens, such as Sine waves, spectral 
analysis’, and infrared scans. Of course, these things are useless 
compared to the information displayed in the screens which we can’t see.

				KAMIDAKI
		The planet is called Earth, its within our 
		district.  There are high levels upper life 
		energy, as well as various unknown sources.

Ones of the screens lights up red.

				KAMIDAKI
		I have found the energy pattern you 
		specified Princess.  Its in a highly 
		localized area of plant life, however, 
		I’m am also reading a strong Jurai 
		energy sequence.

				AEKA
		<softly; to self> Could it be … Yousho?
		My fiancé?

				KAMIDAKI
		The energy sequence is being masked
		by some other more powerful signal, we
		cannot identify the individual causing 
		the signal.

				SASAMI (O.S.)
		Aeka …

SASAMI walks onto the bridge with AZAKA following close behind.
SASAMI comes over to AEKA and looks at the screen showing Earth.

				SASAMI
		Big Sister? Did I hear you talking 
		about Yousho?

				AEKA
		Well I … I was just saying how I hope 
		this is the place where that Pirate Ryouko 
		has gone after she trashed all of Jurai.

				SASAMI
		<annoyed> I wish you could think of 
		something else, we’ve been chasing 
		planets in this sector of space for the 
		last few hundred years.

				AEKA
		I know Sasami, but I feel we are close 
		to a conclusion. We will finally reap the
		rewards for our long hard work.

				SASAMI
		<to herself> What reward is worth all this?

				KAMIDAKI
		I have pinpointed the source and laid
		in a course.

				AEKA
		Very good, take us in.

We see the ship slowly heading towards Earth.

			     Episode 2: That which Speaks


TENCHI is sweeping up the area around the temple, ADAM is painting
the side of the temple.  ADAM stops for a second and TENCHI looks 
over to him.

				ADAM
		You know, this is exactly how I imagined
		spending my spring season.

				RYOUKO (O.S.)
		That’s because you don’t have an active 
		imagination.

RYOUKO appears with her arms draped around TENCHI, he looks
obviously annoyed by this.

				TENCHI
		Hey! I – <sighs> Don’t you feel bad not 
		doing any work?

				RYOUKO
		Oh, all you two ever talk about is work. 
		Tenchi, why don’t you come play around
		with me?

				ADAM
		Sounds like a threat …

A bolt of energy hits the ground in front of ADAM, the stone sizzles 
a bit with the enormous energy it was just hit with.  He looks over 
to RYOUKO who has her normal grin on.

				ADAM
		Hey! I’m working with paint here, you 
		could set the whole place on fire.  And 
		I doubt that Grandpa would like having
		a charred temple.

MIHOSHI walks up the temple stairs with YOUSHO, she is playing 
with some device that looks cubic in nature.

				TENCHI
		Oh, Hi! Mihoshi! Grandpa!

				MIHOSHI
		Good Afternoon!

				RYOUKO
		What cha’ got there MIHOSHI?

				MIHOSHI
		This? Oh this is a utility tool given 
		to all Galaxy Police personnel, in 
		an emergency its supposed to be able 
		to do anything.

				ADAM
		What can you make it do now?

MIHOSHI gets a tear in her eye.

				MIHOSHI
		I can’t remember! Waahhhhhh!

				YOUSHO
		There, there, Mihoshi. I’m sure you’ll
		figure out how to make it do something.

The cubic tool begins to glow a yellow light.

				YOUSHO
		<happy> There you go, you got it to 
		do something.

The light starts to get blinding.

				TENCHI
		Perhaps you can make it stop now 
		Mihoshi.

				MIHOSHI
		I didn’t make it start. Oooh, I bet I
		know what this means …

				ADAM
		What?

The temple and the area around it get dark, as they look into the
sky a large, plant looking ship appears.

				MIHOSHI
		<in awe> It’s a proximity detector. <beat> 
		That’s a Jurai royal family ship!

They all look up into the sky and see the ship settle over a nearby
lake.  They all rush off to the lake to get a closer look.  YOUSHO 
stays back for a second, then follows.  The ship settles above the
lake.

				ADAM
		I wonder if this is a good thing

				RYOUKO
		I don’t think so …

Aeka is still on the bridge looking to the big screen. Suddenly a
smaller screen appears with a zoomed in picture of RYOUKO’s face.
Aeka suddenly turns red.

				AEKA
		There’s the pirate that took Yousho
		away from me! KAMIDAKE! Target that 
		Pirate!

				KAMIDAKE
		Yes, Princess Aeka.

The ship suddenly lurches towards the shore, one of the cannons 
emerges from the side and points at RYOUKO.  Everyone starts to 
shake nervously. AEKA’s voice comes on over an amplified speaker.

				AEKA
		Ryouko, you will surrender yourself 
		at once to be tried for your crimes 
		against the Juraian Empire

ADAM turns to RYOUKO, who doesn’t seem to be at all shocked by this.

				ADAM
		<sarcastic>That would be you, gorgeous.

RYOUKO throws her arms around TENCHI.

				RYOUKO
		Tenchi! You must protect me from this 
		vile creature!

				TENCHI
		Uhhhh … Protect you? How can I protect
		you against THAT?!!

				ADAM
		Looks like an overgrown shrub. I bet 
		my Flo-bee could take it out.

AEKA turns to KAMIDAKI

				AEKA
		Is this thing on? Why aren’t they 
		listening to me?

				AZAKA
		Princess Aeka, regarding Ryouko’s crimes
		against the Emipre …

				AEKA
		Later Azaka. I’m busy. <louder> 
		Kamidaki, fire a warning shot into the 
		lake.

				KAMIDAKI
		Are you sure that’s wise?  They haven’t
		fired at us.

				AEKA
		Just do it!

				KAMIDAKI
		Yes, your highness.

AEKA’s ship fires off a shot into the lake, the wave that ensues 
thoroughly drenches the gang.

				RYOUKO
		She is Evil, Tenchi! You must protect 
		us!

ADAM runs over to MIHOSHI, takes the cubic tool, and begins to mess 
with it.

				ADAM
		This thing must be able to turn into 
		some sort of weapon.

				MIHOSHI
		Hey! Don’t mess with that …

ADAM moves parts of the cube around until it starts to shake.  
Shocked, he holds it up and looks at it.

				ADAM
		I hope this is normal …

				MIHOSHI
		Oh, that’s normal.

				ADAM
		What a relief

				MIHOSHI
		For the self-destruct sequence.

Everyone facefaults and stares at MIHOSHI.

				ALL
		SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE?!!

ADAM looks around, then at the cubic tool in his hand.

				ADAM
		Uhh, here Ryouko, you take this.

				RYOUKO
		Oh thank you so … <alarmed>AAAAHH! 
		I don’t want this!

RYOUKO throws the cubic tool at AEKA’s ship. A screen on the
Bridge of AEKA’s ship shows the small, cubic, tool landing on top
of the ship.

				AEKA
		What’s that?

				KAMIDAKI
		<flat>It appears to be a Galaxy Police
		Hyperdimensional cube. It seems to be 
		in the final stages of Self-Destruct.

				AEKA
		<nonchalant> Oh.

The cube explodes on the side of AEKA’s ship, a large plume of
smoke is created that blocks out all view of what’s left of the Ship.

				RYOUKO
		Oh well, the witch got what she 
		deserved.

				TENCHI
		<in awe> Wow …

				ADAM
		I wonder if that person is okay

				RYOUKO
		I’m sure she isn’t, <cheerful> come on 
		Tenchi! Lets play!

AEKA’s ship, Ryo-ouh, moves out of the cloud of smoke to settle right
above everyone.  The ship has a black char mark, but is otherwise
unaffected.  AEKA’s laugh is heard over a loud speaker.

				AEKA
		Kamidaki! Azaka! Get them.

			AZAKA & KAMIDAKI (sim)
		Yes, Princess Aeka.

The guardians fly out of Ryo-ouh towards everyone.  Floating logs
appear around RYOUKO, TENCHI, ADAM, and MIHOSHI and paralyze them.
AZAKA and KAMIDAKI, one by one, engulf them.  On the bridge of
Ryo-ouh, AEKA is laughing at her handy work.

TENCHI’s eyes flutter open, he is laying in a grassy circle with thick 
vines hanging down around it.

				TENCHI
		Huh? Where am … I bet I know where 
		I am. <weakly> Oh, I just wanna go home.
		I wonder how I can get out of here.

As TENCHI walks through a pair of vines, they quickly stiffen and 
close around the opening TENCHI was trying to get though.  TENCHI 
tries to get through many times, and each time the vines close 
around the opening.  Finally he pulls out a small knife and attacks 
one of the vines by whittling it slowly away.

				TENCHI
		Hah Ha! Take this!

				SASAMI (O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				TENCHI
		I’m trying to get out of here. 
		<pauses> Huh?

SASAMI is outside of the cage of vines, she walks closer to the cage 
and to TENCHI.  SASAMI giggles.

				TENCHI
		Who are you, little girl?

				SASAMI
		I’m Sasami.

				TENCHI
		Sasami … Are you a prisoner here too?

				SASAMI
		No, Silly. This is our ship.

				TENCHI
		Your ship, so that means … Are you 
		an alien from the planet Sasami?
	
				SASAMI
		No, we’re from Jurai.  What’s your name?

				TENCHI
		Oh, how silly of me. I’m Tenchi.

				SASAMI
		Hello Tenchi! <giggles> Will you
		play a game with me?

SASAMI raises up a control for the cage, as she points it to the 
vines they move away like curtains.  TENCHI wearily walks out of the
grassy cage, then looks around quickly.

				TENCHI
		Thanks Sasami, hey, do you know how 
		I might get out of here? I’m here by 
		accident, I really have nothing to do 
		with any of this.

				SASAMI
		I’ll so something for you, if you do 
		something for me.

ADAM’s eyes flutter open, he’s lying in a grassy circle with thick 
vines hanging down around it.

				ADAM
		Eh? Oh man, where am I now?  This 
		is getting way annoying.

ADAM conducts the same experiments as TENCHI did in the last scene, 
with the same amount of success.

				ADAM
		Now this IS an interesting predicament.
		I wonder if someone will rescue me. 
		<pauses> I’m gonna die.

RYOUKO’s eyes fly open, she’s being held upside down by the two 
guardians, KAMIDAKI and AZAKA.  AEKA is standing in front of her.

				RYOUKO
		Well hello, Princess, you’ll excuse me if 
		I don’t bow before you.

				AEKA
		O ho ho ho ho! Ryouko, I finally have 
		you before me, now I can bring you back 
		to Jurai to pay for your crimes! O 
		Ho ho ho ho!

				RYOUKO
		<sarcastic> Oooh, I’m so scared.

The guardians send jolts of electricity through RYOUKO. She screams 
in pain.

				AEKA
		You SHOULD be scared of the Jurai 
		judicial system, you’ll pay dearly for 
		you actions against Jurai.

				AZAKA
		Princess Aeka, about those crimes …

				AEKA
		Oh, what is it now?

				KAMIDAKI
		During your cryogenic sleep, an amount 
		of 697 years occurred.

				AEKA
		So?

				AZAKA
		So by the Stature of Limitations, no 
		crime committed on Jurai shall be held 
		against a person in an excess of 700 years.

AEKA cringes.

				KAMIDAKI
		And as of this morning, the 700 year 
		mark passed and the Galaxy Police 
		destroyed the file of crimes concerning 
		Ryouko.

				AEKA
		Whaaat?!!
		
				RYOUKO
		Ha Hahah! Well, your highness, it looks 
		like I have nothing to fear.

AEKA growls and the guardians send large amounts of electricity 
through RYOUKO, she screams until the pain becomes unbearable and she
faints. The electricity stops.

				AEKA
		<soft; slowly>Wrong you still have much 
		to fear.

A small spherical DROID comes up to AEKA.

				NURSE DROID
		Aeka. Its time to sleep.

				AEKA
		Not now, I’m busy.

				NURSE DROID
		I promised the Queen that I’d keep 
		you on a regular schedule. Now its 
		time for bed.

				AEKA
		<frustrated> Oh, alright.  Put this 
		… thing, in a cell.

			AZAKA & KAMIDAKI (sim)
		Yes, Princess.

AEKA follows the DROID off, then she quickly turns around and yells out.

				AEKA
		And find that Juraian sequence!

TENCHI and SASAMI walk down a path with cages similar to the one 
that TENCHI was in on all sides.  They come to a ridge and look out 
to see the closed structure that is AEKA’s bedroom.

				SASAMI
		There she is.
		
				TENCHI
		And you want me to get the hilt to 
		her sword?

				SASAMI
		Yes.

				TENCHI
		But isn’t it hers?

				SASAMI
		Awww, just get it.

				TENCHI
		Okay okay.
	
TENCHI walks off towards AEKA’s bedroom. When TENCHI is gone, SASAMI
walks back the way they came.  AEKA is lying on a giant bed, asleep, 
and clutching, very tightly, to Yousho’s sword the Tenchi-ken.
TENCHI pauses for a moment at the foot of her bed.

ADAM is sitting in his cage staring up at where the vines are 
controlled.

				ADAM
		I need to get out of here. No one is 
		gonna rescue me, I must find a way 
		out myself.

ADAM stands up and moves closer to the vines. Just as he reaches 
them, they tighten up and block his passage.  As he walks backwards,
they slowly loosen and relax their grip.

				ADAM
		There must be a way to get out of here.
		If only I had my FloBee …

				VOICE (V.O.)
		There is a way …

ADAM quickly spins around, looking for the source of the voice.

				VOICE (V.O.)
		The Vines of Jurai are sensitive to 
		movement, and do not all act of one mind.

				ADAM
		Who’s there? Hello? <long pause> 
		Movement, huh?
		
ADAM reaches into his pocket and pulls out a paintbrush.  He walks 
closer to the vines but stops before they close up. He throws the 
paintbrush at the vines then quickly dashes out of the cage just as 
the vines tighten, narrowly missing him.

				ADAM
		Ha!  Now lets see if I can find the 
		others. <pause> I wonder if grandpa 
		wants that paintbrush back.

TENCHI is still where we left him, standing at the foot of her bed.  
He slowly walks to the side of the bed and tries to take the sword 
gently. AEKA’s grip is too tight for ADAM to get the sword. ADAM 
walks to the other side of the bed and tries again, with no luck.  
He finally crawls on top of her and uses all his strength to pull 
the sword from her grasp.

				TENCHI
		Come on, Let go …

AEKA’s eyes flutter open and see TENCHI right above her.  TENCHI 
quickly grabs her mouth when he sees she’s about to scream.

				TENCHI
		No, don’t scream. This is not what 
		it looks like!

AEKA’s throws TENCHI off her bed and screams out.  TENCHI lands 
with a thud and looks in his hand to see he’ s holding the Tenchi-ken.

				AEKA
		AZAKA! KAMIDAKE! Get that Earthling!
		Kill him!

TENCHI runs out of the room and into the fields with super sonic 
speed.

				AEKA
		My my, he runs awfully fast.

TENCHI runs through the field with the Guardians following him, 
firing at him, barely missing.

ADAM is walking down a field of cages.

				ADAM
		How on earth am I suppose to find my
		way out of here?  This place looks more
		like a Zoo than a ship.

Snoring is heard from a nearby cell. ADAM moves closer to get a 
better look to find MIHOSHI sleeping in the cell.  ADAM slaps 
himself on the forehead.

				ADAM
		MIHOSHI! How can you sleep at a time 
		like this?!!
	
MIHOSHI stays asleep, ADAM gets a discouraged look in his eyes.  He 
looks around the cell until he finds a small device hanging near the 
cell.  He picks it up and when he does the vines around the cage open 
up.  ADAM quickly moves inside and shakes MIHOSHI until she wakes up.

				MIHOSHI
		What happened? Where are we?

				ADAM
		You don’t remember?

				MIHOSHI
		Nope. Not at all.  Did we find that 
		Space Pirate?

ADAM hits himself again in the forehead then proceeds to help 
MIHOSHI to her feet.

				ADAM
		We are on an alien spaceship.  We 
		were captured by these big logs and 
		placed in cells. I have just rescued 
		you, and now we need to find the 
		others. Understand?

				MIHOSHI
		Ummmm… <pause> Nope.

				ADAM
		How did you ever get to be a cop? 
		Never mind, just follow me.

ADAM walks out of the cage with MIHOSHI following.  He walks down a 
path for a while until they come to a tree with a hole near the roots
of the tree.

				ADAM
		I think I saw someone jump into this 
		hole.  I think it would be prudent if 
		we follow. What do you think Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI is standing by a nearby cage, laughing at one of the animals 
in it.

				ADAM
		Why me?

ADAM grabs MIHOSHI, still laughing, and jumps with her down the hole.
As they fall, blue lights appear around them and they disappear, only 
to reappear on the bridge and land with a thump.

				ADAM
		Ouch!

				MIHOSHI
		Oww, that hurt.

				ADAM
		Well that certainly is not a trip I’d
		like to repeat.

				RYOUKO (O.S.)
		Hey! Yoohoooo! Adam! I’m over here!

ADAM turns to see RYOUKO in another one of those cages.  RYOUKO 
is by the vines and waving at ADAM and MIHOSHI.

				ADAM
		Ryouko! I’ve been looking for you!

				RYOUKO
		Well … <cheerful> Now you’ve found me!
		Let me out of this cage will ya?

				ADAM
		Now now, what’s the magic word?

				RYOUKO
		Don’t mess with me!

ADAM rushes over to the cage and uses the device on it.  The vines 
part and Ryouko hovers out of the grassy circle.

				ADAM
		Come on, lets get Tenchi and get 
		out of here.

TENCHI runs down a path in the field of cages with shots from the 
Guardians nearly missing his feet.

				TENCHI
		Ohh, just want to go hooome!

TENCHI comes over a ridge to see SASAMI standing beside the path 
looking at TENCHI.  She waves to him and the guardians as he 
approaches.

				SASAMI
		Hi Tenchi!

TENCHI runs past and picks up SASAMI, the shots from the Guardians 
still missing him by mere inches.

				TENCHI
		Those monsters are trying to kill me!

				SASAMI
		<cheerful; playful>Their not monsters,
		their my sister's.

				TENCHI
		Whatever they are, their gonna shoot 
		me!

TENCHI approaches a pond of water where the path he’s following 
forks.  SASAMI points off to the left.

				SASAMI
		Go that way Tenchi.

TENCHI obliges and runs left.

				SASAMI
		Jump in there Tenchi, they can’t 
		get you in there.

				TENCHI
		Are you sure?

TENCHI jumps down the hole and the sounds of the Guardians hitting 
the side of the tree are heard.  On the way down SASAMI is cheering.
The blue lights surround them, and they appear on the bridge.

				TENCHI
		Oouch!

				ADAM (O.S.)
		Tenchi!

				RYOUKO (O.S.)
		My Tenchi!!

RYOUKO flies over to TENCHI and wraps his arms around him.  She 
then moves back a bit and looks at SASAMI.

RYOUKO
	<annoyed> Who’s this, Tenchi?

				TENCHI
		Uhh, This is Sasami.

				SASAMI
		Pleased to meet you.

				ADAM
		Hi Sasami! I’m Adam.

				SASAMI
		Hi Adam!

				RYOUKO
		<flat> Enough with these introductions,
		 lets get out of here!

				AEKA (O.S.)
		I’m afraid that won’t happen, Pirate!

AEKA walks onto the bridge with AZAKA and KAMIDAKI at her sides.

				AEKA
		Sasami! Are you the cause of these 
		prisoners escape? Azaka! Kamidaki! 
		Get them!

			AZAKA & KAMIDAKI (sim)
		Yes, Princess Aeka.

The Guardians move forward towards the group.  ADAM suddenly jumps 
in front of them all and points the device at them.

				ADAM
		Stay right there! I’ve got this … and 
		I don’t know how to use it!

				AEKA
		O ho ho ho ho ho! That silly key won’t 
		do anything against MY key.

ADAM points the key at various things which, on command, do nothing.  
ADAM slowly shrinks back with the others.

				RYOUKO
		Quickly, Tenchi! Do something!

				TENCHI
		<scared>What can I do? I don’t know
		how to fight these things!

The Tenchi-ken begins to glow in TENCHI’s hand; vines from above swing 
down and entrap the Guardians.

				AEKA (aside)
		How is he doing that? <pause> The 
		master Key, its reacting to him. How
		is that possible, its only supposed to
		react to people of royal blood.

				RYOUKO
		<chants> Ryo-ohki! Come quickly!

A loud “myaah” is heard in the distance and suddenly a spike from a 
large ship spears into the bridge and is sticking out of the ground.

				RYOUKO
		Quickly Tenchi! Lets go!

RYOUKO puts TENCHI in a head lock and drags him into the ship.  ADAM 
and MIHOSHI soon follow.

				SASAMI
		<waving> Bye bye, Tenchi, Adam.

Inside Ryo-ohki, RYOUKO walks to a pair of globes that are near a 
chair and puts her hands on them.

				RYOUKO
		I’m going to bring her down to Earth.
		As long as she’s up here she can 
		still be a danger to us.

				TENCHI
		Are you sure that’s necessary?

				RYOUKO
		Hey! Whose side are you on anyway?
		If you care for Aeka so much, you can
		go join her.

Ryo-ohki turns around in space, and, because it has currently speared
Ryo-ouh, both ships start heading towards Earth.  As they get close 
to the atmosphere, re-entry heat begins to scald both ships.

				AEKA
		Ryouko! What are you doing?!! You’ll 
		kill us both! Quickly, Azaka! Release 
		the outer hull!

				AZAKA
		Yes your highness.

Most of Ryo-ouh detaches from the ship and flies away from the ship.
The parts slow down the decent of the ship as it crashes into the 
lake, skidding along the shoreline for miles.

TENCHI, ADAM, RYOUKO, SASAMI, MIHOSHI, and NOBOYUKI are sitting at a
table eating and watching Television. On the news is reports of people
seeing the crash.

				NOBOYUKI
		Hmmm, last night was an interesting 
		night.

				TENCHI
		Don’t remind me, Dad.

				NOBOYUKI
		And what are you so upset about? 
		Everyone got back safe and sound

				RYOUKO
		Thanks to my ship. You know, I risked
		my life to save us all.

				SASAMI
		But it was our ship that took all the 
		damage, so it was Ryo-ouh that saved
		us.

				RYOUKO
		<wondering>Oh, so that’s why re-entry
		wasn’t so bad.

				NOBOYUKI
		Hey, weren’t there four of you girls?

				ADAM
		Aeka is outside trying to pull her ship 
		out of the lake.

				ALL (sim)
		Ohh…

AEKA runs into the house and stares at SASAMI.

				AEKA
		Sasami! What are you doing in here,
		eating with that … thing! You must 
		help get Ryo-ouh free from the lake!

				SASAMI
		But the ship is too big for the two 
		of us to pull out.

				AEKA
		But we must try! We can take it out 
		piece by piece!

AEKA runs back out to the lake.

				ADAM
		Geeze, all that time in space must 
		have gotten to her brain.

				RYOUKO
		It figures it would happen eventually
		to a person like her.

AEKA is pulling on one of the pieces of the ship hanging over the 
coastline.  She pulls on the piece until it breaks off.  She falls 
backwards holding the piece.

				AEKA
		Where is that Sasami?  We can’t get 
		stuck here! We just CAN’T!

AEKA trips and the piece of ship flies out of her hand and his the 
ship; the ship sinks even farther down into the lake.


Authors Notes:
	In retrospect, I wish I had watched the OAV episodes before writing the 
first story.  They have much more attention to detail and more plot than the TV 
epsiodes.  But I can’t change the first episode anymore, so I’m not going to.  
From now on, this series will be a blending of the OAV series and the TV 
series. The Best of Both Worlds as you would have it.
	The Voice will be explained later, right now all you should know is that 
the voice is helping Adam.  For what reasons, we wont know until the next part 
of the story.
	Tenchi Muyou! was created by Masaki Kajishima and brought to North 
America by Pioneer Ltd.  Tempest Creations, Starlight Pictures, and Twister 
Plot Productions are all alias’ for the same company which is respective of 
myself at present.  While others will join me in the future, at the moment 
those companies are composed only of me.
