					INTERLUDE

Establishing Shot: Darkness.  As V.O. proceeds, fade into starry expanse
panning across the various constellations and systems before finally settling
on the eastern hemisphere of earth.

					ADAM (V.O.)
			When I was young, I used to look
			out into space and wonder what
			life was out there.  My greatest
			dream would be to one day grow
			up to help work on launching an
			interstellar ship and meet who or
			whatever was out there. <beat>
			When I finally realized that the
			possibility of such an occurrence
			was so slim, I began to concentrate
			my efforts in making those creatures
			come to earth.  Not in ships or in sub-
			space portals, but in the imagery
			of the human mind.  My dreams were
			now filled with making the New York
			Times bestseller list, an event that
			I’m sad to say never happened.
			It was funny, or maybe ironic, that
			I was thinking about those times, 
 			when I was young, at the time I 
			stumbled across Tenchi Masaki’s 
			house only four days ago. <beat>
			Excerpt from the fourth Chapter
			of Adam Leigh's first bestseller
			novel, A Promise To Pluto, 
			published on August 1st, 2015

Quickly zoom into Japan and to the Masaki household where AZAKA
and KAMIDAKE are standing at the gates to the property.  The newspaper
boy rolls up on a bike and leans over to push a paper through the
slot on one side of AZAKA.

					AZAKA
			Thank you good sir.

The boy quickly stumbles backwards and AZAKA turns to face the boy.
He, of course, screams and runs away, tugging his bike behind him.

		KAMIDAKE
			What do you think was the problem?

					AZAKA
			I don’t know.

Cut to the inside of the Masaki household.  ADAM slowly walks down
the staircase in one of Tenchi’s work outfits.  He’s buttoning up the
shirt as he walks.

					ADAM
			<mumbles to himself> I gotta get
			myself a wardrobe, I can hardly
			stand these outfits anymore.

Pan backwards to show TENCHI facing away from
the staircase in a couch.

					ADAM
			Hey, Tenchi.  You know, these
			pants are kinda small,  maybe
			you father has something I can
			use.

Cut to TENCHI’s face, he starting off out of the house towards the lake
that the couch faces.  ADAM stops in his tracks when he doesn’t get a
response from TENCHI.

					ADAM
			<louder> YO!

TENCHI jerks up and looks at ADAM.

					TENCHI
			Sorry, <beat> I don’t think
			my father has anything you
			could fit in, he isn’t that much
			bigger than me.  You could
			wear one of the robes that
			Grandpa has though.

ADAM raises his hands in defeat.

					ADAM
			Oh, no.  I definitely won’t
			wear one of those.  I should
			be fine with the clothes I
			came in.  I’ll just wash them
			up and wear ‘em again. <beat>
			So what were you thinking
			about that you didn’t notice
			me?

					TENCHI
			Oh, just about what I saw in
			Funaho’s mind yesterday. I
			was wondering about something
			I saw, about the cave by my
			Grandpa’s shrine.  <beat>
			Hey, would you mind checking
			it out with me?

					ADAM
			<wearily> Uhhh…

			     Episode 4: Yousho Revealed


Establishing Shot: The Masaki cave.  TENCHI and ADAM are standing
outside of the cave staring in.

				ADAM
		Do we knock?

				TENCHI
		<sarcastic> Very funny.

				ADAM
		Honestly, what are we doing
		here?  I promised I'd come with
		you, but we're just standing out
		here.  What are you expecting?

				TENCHI
		Nothing <pause> nothing.  Lets
		go in.

ADAM shrugs and starts walking into the cave, TENCHI follows shortly
behind him.  Half way into the cave they find a gate that looks
surprisingly new.

				ADAM
		Natch.

				TENCHI
		I'm sorry?

				ADAM
		Nothing.  This doesn't look
		too old, can't be more than
		10 years old.  Assuming no
		one has been in here polishing
		it every day.

				TENCHI
		<quietly> 13 years would fit
		better.

				ADAM
		Did you say something?

				TENCHI
		No.

				ADAM
		Are we looking for anything in
		particular?

				TENCHI
		I'll know it when I see it.

				ADAM
		I hate people who say that,
		I never know what to expect.

TENCHI does a sweeping kick against the gate and its flies back
on its hinges.  ADAM looks impressed.

				ADAM
		I suppose there is always more
		than one way to skin a cat.

				TENCHI
		Come on.

TENCHI leads them now.  As they continue farther into the cave they
see signs of more and more disrepair, until they come across a part
of the cave that almost completely caved in.

				ADAM
		Lemme guess, we're getting
		closer?

				TENCHI
		Yup, this is looking familiar.

				ADAM
		<inaudible> Familiar?

They climb over the fallen debris and continue down the cave until
they come to part where it looks like a giant boulder had been split
open.

				TENCHI
		This is it.  This is what I'm 
		looking for.

				ADAM
		Okay, now will you tell me
		why we're looking for the Flintstones?

				TENCHI
		Flintstones?

				ADAM
		Forget it, I'm playing to the wrong
		audience.  Just tell me what we
		found.

				TENCHI
		This is the rock that Ryouko was
		imprisoned in.  I accidentally let
		her loose when I was only five
		years old.  And if what I saw in
		the memory of Funaho was right …

TENCHI begins moving through rocks, picking them up and throwing
them places.  ADAM is afraid to help, in case he moves what TENCHI
is looking for, so he just watches.  TENCHI stops when he comes to
one unmarked stone.

				ADAM
		Found something?

TENCHI holds up the stone, on the side it has several Japanese
characters that pretty much outline the specifics of the seal that
was placed on RYOUKO.  There is a small hole in the rock.

				TENCHI
		This seal was made by Yousho,
		Aeka's brother, it operated off
		a special gem that Ryouko uses
		for power.  I just bet, that if I use
		my gem on this, I could find Yousho.

				ADAM
		Is this a personal theory, or do
		you have any information to back
		this up?

				TENCHI
		If I can get the seal to work, I
		can follow the energy of one
		of the gems to find the others.

				ADAM
		I guess it doesn't hurt to try,
		just as long as you don't seal
		ME in that rock for an eon.

ADAM helps TENCHI move the rock over to a section of the cave that
is flatter.  TENCHI takes out the Tenchi-Ken and holds it next to the
rock.

				TENCHI
		Now, how did I do this before?

TENCHI places a finger on the gem.  The gem glows for a minute then
dislodges itself from the sword and lands in TENCHI's hand.  He sticks
the gem slowly into the rock.  They both wait for the light show,
which never comes.

				ADAM
		What happened? Is our credit
		bad?

The stone lifts itself off the ground and begins to shake.  The rest
of the cave also begins to shutter.

				ADAM
		I don't think this cave can take
		this sort of action.

				TENCHI
		I think your right, lets get out of
		here.

TENCHI moves to get the gem from the rock when it emits a beam
of white light straight up and out of the cave, into space.  After a
second of the light, it abruptly stops and the stone comes crashing
into the ground.  The cave continues to shake, parts of the ceiling
are now falling around TENCHI and ADAM.

				ADAM
		Hurry, Tenchi!

				TENCHI
		I’m going as fast as I can, I
		just have to --

TENCHI pulls the gem out of the rock and drops it.  It rolls around
on the ground, under a piece of rock.

				TENCHI
		I dropped the gem!

A large rock slams into the ground between TENCHI and ADAM.

				ADAM
		What do you mean dropped?!

TENCHI and ADAM frantically look for the gem, while dodging falling
pieces of rock.  During the shaking, the gem rolls out and stops by
ADAM's foot.

				TENCHI
		There it is! <points> Get it!

				ADAM
		<looks at gem> Right! Get
		out of here.

TENCHI moves to get out, ADAM reaches down and picks up the gem
then runs after TENCHI.  Just as he leaves the one section of cave, it
collapses.  Both TENCHI and ADAM start running as fast as they can
out of the cave.

				ADAM
		Faster, Tenchi, Faster!

ADAM's hand begins to smoke, he lets out a scream.  As the come to
the entrance of the cave they both dive out as the section above them
collapses, pushing out plumes of smoke.  They both breathe deeply
as they watch the cave continue to collapse.

				ADAM
		<between breaths> Well,
		that was a sterling success.

				TENCHI
		I had no idea …

				ADAM
		<yells out> Ooww! <normal>
		Damn you, this thing is burning
		me.

				TENCHI
		Here, I'll put it back in the
		sword.

ADAM goes to give the gem to TENCHI, just as he opens his hand he
freezes.  They both look into his palm.

				TENCHI
		What happened?

				ADAM
		It -- its embedded into my hand!

Cut to space, pan across a few stars before it's all blocked off by a giant
ship that flies in orbit of earth.  Fade into the ship, across a great hall, a
beautiful looking organ, and finally the back of a man dressed in greens
with whitish hair looking down into a globe.  Pan over his shoulder to 
look into the globe which is showing a playback of the beam from Tenchi’s
gem.  The globe goes black and we see the reflection of the man who we
can clearly see is KATAGO.

					KATAGO
			Now Ryouko, we will finish what
			we had started 700 years ago.

The image of KATAGO shimmers and disappears in a cloud of green
energy. Fade to black.

A part of the blackness is pealed away and we see RYOUKO’S face.

					ADAM (V.O.)
			Ryouko! Stop that!

Cut to the inside of the Masaki house, ADAM is replacing the bandage
over his hand that RYOUKO had just pulled off. AEKA is sitting in a
nearby sofa with SASAMI.

					RYOUKO
			Awww, come on. Lemme see it!

					ADAM
			Absolutely not!  What’s wrong
			with you, this is serious.

TENCHI walks in from the kitchen with a piece of plant and a glass of
water.

					TENCHI
			Ryouko, stop bugging him.
			<beat>  Here Adam, this is
			Grandpa’s secret pain relief
			herb.

ADAM looks at the plant in disgust.

					ADAM
			And I gotta eat this?

TENCHI nods.

					ADAM
			<sighs, grabs the herb> When 
			did I end up in an episode of 
			Dr. Quinn?  Gimme that glass.

ADAM takes the herb, and quickly after, the water.  RYOUKO goes
back to clinging to TENCHI.

					RYOUKO
			You know, Tenchi, if you had
			given me the gems like I had
			asked before, you wouldn’t have
			these problems.

					AEKA
			If we had given you those gems,
			we’d have a whole different set
			of problems to worry about.

					RYOUKO
			Yes, but you wouldn’t have
			*these* problems, princess.

					ADAM
			If you're so good with these gems
			why don't YOU try to take them out?

RYOUKO teleports away from Tenchi and behind ADAM, then proceeds
to drape her arms around him.

					RYOUKO
			Oooh! I though you'd never ask!
			Now, <beat> hold still.

ADAM mentions something inaudible under his breath as RYOUKO
grabs his hand takes off the bandages.  To her surprise, it's glowing.

					ADAM
			Wow! What are you doing?

					RYOKO
			<nervous> Umm … Nothing. I
			don't know what's going on.

RYO-OHKI bursts into the room and runs screaming into RYOUKO's
hands.

					RYOKO
			<angry> Not now, Ryo-ohki.

					RYO-OHKI
			Myaa! MYAAA MYAA! Myaa!

RYOUKO looks up, looking angrier than before then runs out of the
house.

					TENCHI
			Ryouko! Wait, what's going
			on?

The rest of the group runs out of the house.  When they are all gone
MIHOSHI walks in from the kitchen with a handful of pastries.

					MIHOSHI
			Where is everybody?

Cut to the edge of the Lake, RYOUKO, TENCHI, AEKA, ADAM, and SASAMI are 
standing around.  RYO-OHKI is in SASAMI's arms, and everyone is looking at 
RYOUKO.

					TENCHI
			What's going on, Ryouko?

RYOUKO looks around, darting her head in every direction before
looking straight up.

					RYOUKO
			<Scornfully> Katago.

A green ball of energy appears above RYOUKO and cracks open as KATAGO floats 
out of it, the ball of energy sealing itself behind him and dissapearing.

					KATAGO
			Well, Ryouko, good to know you
			haven't forgotten about me. I, of
			course, haven't forgotten <beat>
			you.

					RYOUKO
			<loud; enraged> DIE!

RYOUKO flies up at KATAGO at full speed and runs into a green tinted
force field that knocks her off to the side.  KATAGO slowly floats 
towards RYOUKO.

					KATAGO
			<calm; calculating> You are quite
			an imperfection.  You should know
			by now you can't attack me like that.
			Now, come quietly and I won't be 
			forced to harm you further.

As KATAGO approaches, TENCHI jumps in with the Tenchi-ken extended
and its blue blade pointed at KATAGO.  ADAM rushes in behind and grabs
RYOUKO.

					TENCHI
			You'll not come any farther!

					KATAGO
			Ahh, so you are the one with the
			Master Key.  But I wouldn't go
			waving that around boy, it’s the
			Kings property.

					TENCHI
			What king?

					KATAGO
			Foolish boy, you would attack me
			with a sword without fully knowing
			its properties.  Give that to me!

KATAGO points his hand at TENCHI as a pulse of wind strikes him,
knocking him backwards.  KATAGO reaches for the sword again with
a pulse of wind that TENCHI fights, allowing KATAGO to get within
inches of the sword before ADAM jumps in and knocks TENCHI and
the Tenchi-ken out of the way.

					ADAM
			<panting> I get the feeling that
			this guy is bad.

					KATAGO
			You are even more foolish than
			this boy.  You're life means little
			more to me than dust.

KATAGO shoots a green bolt of energy towards ADAM who holds up his
hands in defense.  The green bolt smashes into his hands, knocking him a few 
meters backwards onto the ground.  His hand jumps with electricity as
the Gem in his palm glows serenely.  KATAGO hovers closer to ADAM,
who is unconscious, and looks down at his hand.

					KATAGO
			Even more intriguing.  You may
			be of use to me yet. <beat> But
			as to the Master Key --

As KATAGO turns around, TENCHI leaps up at him with the sword and
takes a long swing at him.  KATAGO quickly hovers off to the side as
the blue streak of the sword flies past his face.  As TENCHI lands, a
drop of green blood trickles down from KATAGO's cheek.

					KATAGO
			<growls> If you want to fight
			me, boy, a fight is what you
			will get!

KATAGO generates a sword, much like RYOUKO's, only green and
larger.  He takes a swing at TENCHI that knocks him back, then
continues to swing at TENCHI, knocking him back farther towards the
lake.  In a sweeping gesture, KATAGO knocks TENCHI into the lake,
knocking the Tenchi-ken away from him.

As KATAGO reaches for the sword, it flies away, over the tops of 
everyone's head and into YOUSHO's hand, who is suddenly standing
behind the girls.

					YOUSHO
			Playing with toys that aren't
			yours, eh?

KATAGO looks at YOUSHO with scorn, he then grins and looks to
RYOUKO.  She holds her head for a moment then her eyes turn green.

					KATAGO
			<whispers> You remember what
			it's like under my control, don't you?
			<to Yousho; loud> Well, if it isn't
			Yousho, the first crown prince of
			Jurai!  I finally have the pleasure
			of meeting you for the first, and
			by far, the last time.

Cut to AEKA's face, she gasps then looks at YOUSHO.  Cut to a
younger looking YOUSHO, which fades into the present day YOUSHO.

					YOUSHO
			Big words from someone who is
			such a coward.

KATAGO grits his teeth evilly then shoots off a green bolt of energy
at YOUSHO which slams against a translucent shield and dissapates.

Cut to a close-up of YOUSHO's face, he closes his eyes, then activates
the Tenchi-ken and opens his eyes.  Panning backwards, YOUSHO
unleashes a series of skillful moves against KATAGO, who dodges them
masterfully.  YOUSHO manages to get up close and is pointing his sword
at KATAGO's throat when RYOUKO begins firing at the two of them from
above.  She plummets to the ground, continuing to fire at YOUSHO until
she actually hits the ground.  She levitates upwards like a puppet and
activates her sword.

KATAGO is laughing maniacally.

					YOUSHO
			<yelling> Using a woman as
			your shield, COWARD!

					KATAGO
			We'll see who the coward is,
			<louder> attack!

RYOUKO rushes into YOUSHO with her sword extended.  The sword hits
YOUSHO's shield and the two energies spark as they fight against each
other.  YOUSHO leaps into the air as KATAGO tries to shoot him while he
is distracted.

					YOUSHO
			Ryouko!  Wake up, don't let
			him control you like this!

					KATAGO
			Nonsense, she can't wake from
			the control I have on her.

KATAGO fires at YOUSHO again, who dodges and uses the movement
to make an upward slash at RYOUKO's arm.  The force knocks her away
from him and she lands in the lake.  KATAGO swings at YOUSHO again,
who dodges it and throws the sword into a nearby tree.

					KATAGO
			<calm> Giving up so quickly?

KATAGO goes to the sword and grabs it, as he does it pulsates with
electricity that flows though him with a vengeance.  He is forced to let
go when the pain is unbearable.  Katago floats beside it, panting.

					KATAGO
			So <beat> this boy is your… <beat>
			successor?

KATAGO floats back into the air, levitating RYOUKO and ADAM with
him.  The green ball of energy opens up behind him.

					KATAGO
			We're finished for this time, but if you
			ever want to get these two back
			you'll come to me on my ship, the
			Souja.  I'll be waiting for you, ahaaha!

The green ball of energy closes behind KATAGO and dissapears.

AEKA immediately runs at YOUSHO and knocks him down.

					AEKA
			You're YOSHO! You're my brother
			Yousho, aren't you?  Why didn't you
			tell me?  What did you have to hide?

					YOUSHO
			Calm down, calm down, don't scold
			me for trying to protect you.  <beat>
			Aeka, if I had stayed on Jurai, there
			would have been a conflict on who
			would have the throne.  You must
			have known that I wasn't intending
			on coming back, there was too much
			prejudice on Jurai for me to bear.
			I'm sorry Aeka, I didn't know you had
			you heart so very set on me.
			<falsetto> I've got an Idea, we can
			get married now, what do ya think?

					AEKA
			<blushes; annoyed> Brother, please!

AEKA bumps into YOUSHO with her hip.  He reels back in pain then
pulls her over to TENCHI, who has since returned from the lake.

					YOUSHO
			<normal voice> But Tenchi here is
			at the right age, and he's a good
			grandson.

Both TENCHI and AEKA blush this time.  TENCHI turns away from AEKA
and YOUSHO and look into the lake.  There is silence for a moment.

					TENCHI
			I have to go after them.

					AEKA
			You certanly do NOT have to go after
			her.  She is the cause of all our problems.

					TENCHI
			Just the same, I must go after both of
			them.  I can't play favors.

					YOUSHO
			Tenchi, take that sword over there. It is
			your sword now, and you must use it to
			protect these women.  Do you accept
			this responsibility?

TENCHI nods then runs over to the tree and starts to pull the
Tenchi-ken out off the tree.  As he does, a field of energy surrounds
him and the sword and bonds with him.

					YOUSHO
			The sword has acknowledged Tenchi
			as its new owner.

TENCHI returns with the sword and is surrounded by everyone,
even MIHOSHI who has found he way out of the house.

					YOUSHO
			So, will go to save those you care
			for with a sword you cannot handle?
			Even though, will you still go?

TENCHI nods.

					TENCHI
			Hai!

YOUSHO reaches into his robe and pulls out the missing third gem
and hands it to TENCHI.

					YOUSHO
			Take this gem, and give it to Ryouko.
			She has been searching for it for a long
			time.

TENCHI takes the gem and turns around to look at everyone else.

					TENCHI
			Lets go.

					MIHOSHI
			So, how do we get there without
			a ship?

TENCHI looks puzzled for only a moment before RYO-OHKI starts
meowing and hops towards the lake.

					TENCHI
			Ryo-ohki, what is it?

					MIHOSHI
			Maybe she knows something.

					TENCHI
			Lets go!

TENCHI and MIHOSHI walk off. SASAMI starts to walk then turns back
to AEKA.

					SASAMI
			Aeka? <beat; cheerful> AEKA!

AEKA smiles and nods.

Cut to the gang standing at the very edge of the water, RYO-OHKI
is in the middle and growling at the lake.

					SASAMI
			What's going on?

Part's of AEKA's ship raise up from the water as RYO-OHKI leaps into
the air towards the ship.  As she flies, she begins to bludge as her
fur turns a dark gray and expands erratically until it look like the
ship she was in the beginning.

					SASAMI
			<crying>Oh, NO! My little Ryo-ohki!

					TENCHI
			<nervous> Uh, I guess we could use
			that as a ship.

Fade out to black, then fade in to the interior of the Souja.  KATAGO
is looking into a globe that shows RYO-OHKI approaching the Souja.

					KATAGO
			Well, it looks like they decided to
			come after you, Ryouko.  Such
			a waste of time a pitiful effort
			for someone so obviously
			defective.

Pan backwards to show two capsules to the left and right of KATAGO.
One of the capsules is shaped like an hourglass and is filled with a blue
sand and has RYOUKO in it keeping her from moving her lower body.
The other capsule is shaped normally and has an unconscious ADAM
lying inside of it.

					RYOUKO
			I am NOT your machine anymore,
			I am a human being!

					KATAGO
			Yes, and in the scheme of things
			human emotions are worth a little
			more than dust. <beat> You know,
			your current form was chosen only
			because it was convenient. The
			initial form could have been anything
			I chose.  I could have made you a
			rock, <beat> would you like to be a
			rock?

RYOUKO gasps, KATAGO laughs maniacally.

					KATAGO
			Now, lets give our guests the
			welcoming they deserve!

					RYOUKO
			You harm a hair on Tenchi and
			you will pay. <pan back> Do you
			hear me? YOU WILL PAY!!

Cut to interior of RYO-OHKI, on the viewscreen, Souja is powering
up her weapons.

					AEKA (V.O.)
			The Souja is ready to fire,

Pan backwards to show AEKA, MIHOSHI, and TENCHI standing around
each other.  MIHOSHI is at the controls and AEKA and TENCHI are standing
beside her.

					AEKA
			<stressful> Please, try to
			avoid it.

					MIHOSHI
			Well, I would, really.  But I don't
			really know what I am doing.

Cut to exterior of ship, the Souja fires off its first rounds that impact
on the hull of RYO-OHKI.  She screams in pain but remains still.  Cut
to interior of the ship; MIHOSHI, AEKA and TENCHI fall to the deck
and slide across the ship.  AEKA stumbles back up to the controls.

					AEKA
			Ryo-ohki! I order you to fire!

Another round of shots strike RYO-OHKI.

					AEKA
			Oh.. I can't control this ship.

Cut to interior of the Souja; KATAGO is looking down into the globe
showing the damage that RYO-OHKI is taking.  Pan over KATAGO's
left shoulder to show ADAM waking up inside the capsule and looking
around.

					ADAM
			<soft; in pain> Oh, wow, did
			that hurt like nothing else…
			<beat> Hey, what happened.

					KATAGO
			Well now, if it isn't the gem
			wielding boy, I trust you've
			enjoyed your rest, I know I
			have.

					ADAM
			What's going on here? Why am I
			being held captive? Where is everyone
			else?

					KATAGO
			You are a guest on my space ship
 			the Souja, it really is a modest ship
			when you look at it.

					ADAM
			Cut the crap, why are you doing
			this?

					KATAGO
			I merely came here to retrieve my
			possessions.  It was truly unfortunate
			that you happened to be in the way
			of my obtaining the gems.  But of
			course, I'm always intrigued by a 
			mystery, for instance, could you
			tell me how you managed to get
			that gem in your hand like that.
			All my research says that is its
			impossible to meld the gems with
			normal humans <beat> unless you
			aren't a normal human.

					ADAM
			<softer> No one here could be considered
			normal, this place is worse than the
			Twilight Zone.  <lounder> Anyway, I'm
			as real and as human as you'll ever
			find!

					KATAGO
			We shall see how normal you are,
			specimen.

Cut to interior of RYO-OHKI, AEKA is sitting at the controls and
TENCHI is standing behind her.

					TENCHI
			Aeka, can we attack from your ship?

					AEKA
			<uneasy> I'm not sure how much of
			my ship has been reformed. It may
			be possible <beat> I will go.

TENCHI puts a hand on AEKA and keeps her in her chair.

					TENCHI
			No Aeka, you can't.  I will go.

TENCHI pulls out the third gem from his pocket, he holds
it out to AEKA.

					TENCHI
			Keep this, and give it to Ryouko if
			you get to see her before me.

					AEKA
			<soft> Tenchi.. <beat, worried>
			Lord Tenchi!!

TENCHI has already left the screen.  Cut to the bridge of RYO-OH;
TENCHI appears in a sparkle of electricity.  He steps forward
and looks up at the screen.

					TENCHI
			Okay, Aeka. I'm ready.

AEKA's picture appears on the screen.

					AEKA
			First you must activate the Wings
			of the Light Hawk.

					TENCHI
			Wings of the Light Hawk?

					AEKA
			The Light Hawk Wings are the primary
			defense of the ship.  It can be used
			to attack but <beat> It wasn't 
			designed to do so, please be careful.

					TENCHI
			<nods> I will.

An explosion wracks the ship and the image on the screen disturbs
a little.

					TENCHI
			<yelling> Just tell me how to
			use them!

Cut to exterior of RYO-OHKI; the Light Hawk Wings appear and shield
the RYO-OHKI from incoming fire.  Cut to the interior of the Souja,
RYOUKO is shaking her head violently as ADAM slams his body against
the glass of the capsule.

					KATAGO
			Ahhh, the Light Hawk Wings,
			well, I have a suitable response
			to that.

Cut to the Exterior of the Souja as it charges all its energy into one
shot. Pan across to RYO-OHKI as the Light Hawk Wings merge into
a big disc then funnel towards the ship.

Cut to interior of RYO-OH, TENCHI has his hands around a floating
TENCHIKEN.  He struggles as he moves them closer and across the
TENCHIKEN.  In the distance, the energy buildup can be heard.

					TENCHI
			<straining> Yaaaaaa!

Cut to exterior of RYO-OHKI, a white ball of energy shoots out from the
center of the funnel and flies towards the Souja. Cut across to the Souja,
it fires its shot and we follow it as it impacts with TENCHI's shot and
explodes with a big burst of light.

Cut across everyone's face then to TENCHI's as he looses his concentration
and yells.  Cut to the explosion, it suddenly disappears and the green
ball of energy from the Souja continues on its course, striking RYO-OH
and destroying it.

Cut to interior of RYO-OHKI; on the view screen, a bunch of images
from the wreckage is being displayed.

					AEKA
			Tenchi? <beat; worried> Tenchi?
			<beat> Tenchi?! TENCHI?!
			TENCHI?!! <beat> AAAHHHHH!

Cut to interior of the Souja, KATAGO is closest, over his left is the
capsule with ADAM in it, who has suddenly stopped moving, over
his right is the capsule with RYOUKO, who is agast.

					RYOUKO
			<very loud> YAAAHHHH!

The bluish sand funnels to the top of the hourglass and the glass
shatters as RYOUKO teleports away.  KATAGO looks surprised,
then smiles evilly.

Cut to the exterior of the Souja, RYOUKO appears and flies towards
the wreckage of RYO-OH.  She moves about the wreckage quickly
while searching.

					RYOUKO
			Tenchi? Tenchi where are you?
			Tenchi--

Cut to the bandana TENCHI was wearing, which is soaked with red
blood.  We see RYOUKO's shaking hand grab it then pull it close to
her.  She cries, loud and openly, into the bandana.  When she 
manages to get a hold of herself she turns to the Souja.

					RYOUKO
			Katago, <swallows; deepens voice>
			Katago, you have taken from me all
			that was dear.  You will not escape
			this act; by my soul I will make you
			pay. <beat> YOU WILL PAAAAYYYY!!!!

Fade to black.
