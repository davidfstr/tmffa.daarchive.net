Okay, this is a Tenchi Universe fan-fic. I do not own most of the characters, 
places, backstories,
T-shirts, "art photos", etc. of the Tenchi Universe anime/manga/god-knows-what 
series. So don't sue me. 
Please? I'll be your best friend. Whaddya say? Pretty please?


No Need For a Protector 
Part 1: The Arrival
by Crash the Boy Blunder
********************************************************************************
**
	Okibi rested his head against the seed bag, and let out a deep sigh. The 
day had been rough on the
young man, between outdoor chores, training with Katsuhito and Tenchi, and 
trying to break up the 
"discussion" between Ryoko and Ayeka. ESPECIALLY the argument. I'll never be 
doing THAT again, he 
thought to himself as he pulled the dusty tarp over him as a makeshift blanket.

	A half an hour later, Okibi got up exasperated. Despite his strenuous day, 
he was completely wired. 
He picked up his bokken and stretched, reminding him of all the bumps and 
bruises he accumulated over the 
course of the day. He started practicing some of his techniques, emitting harsh 
sighs as he swings flurries of 
kicks, slashes, stabs and blocks. 

	Meanwhile, a small figure sat on the front doorstep to watch. She watched  
as he continued his 
routines, her soft pink eyes not missing a movement. She propped her head on her 
hands as she watched 
even closer, letting her light-blue hair drape around them. She sighed as he 
continued, oblivious to her 
presence, and thought back to the first time he met her.

*********

	Sasami gazed out the window as the sun set lazily over the pond, casting 
flecks of gold onto the 
water's surface. She smiled, and thought of the one person who made her smile 
the most: Tenchi. No matter 
how things were going, she could take one look at him, and a warm calm would 
spread over her. Besides, 
oftentimes, he would get really nervous and fall over, and despite how it often 
looked as if it hurt, it was a bit 
funny to watch. 

	Her gaze wandered from the pond to the skyline and back as twilight set 
in. Suddenly, her sharp 
gaze spotted a small streak barrelling toward the house. Her eyes lit up in 
shock, and she scurried back inside 
to get Tenchi, who she found in between Ayeka and Ryoko, who were having yet 
another argument.

	"Leave Tenchi alone, you wicked, immoral temptress!!" Ayeka cried as she 
pushed Ryoko away 
from Tenchi. Ryoko pushed back, and spat back, "Why don't you leave my Tenchi 
alone, you cold, 
self-righteous, egomaniacal bitch!!" The two of them locked each other in a 
fervent gaze, staring daggers at 
each other, with Tenchi looking on at this catfight-in-the-making. "Uh girls," 
Tenchi said quite nervously, "I 
wish you two wouldn't- -" He was quickly interrupted by both of them yelling, 
"Stay out of this!!"  The two 
of them continued their staring contest as Sasami rushed Tenchi with the news of 
the arrival. Tenchi's eyes 
widened, and rushed outside to check for himself to find a baseball-sized 
fireball headed for the house and 
approaching fast. He covered Sasami with his body, and braced himself for the 
eventual impact.

	As the treeship hurtled toward Earth at its suicidal pace, a small figure 
worked at the controls of the
slightly-larger ship desperately, sweat pouring off his forehead. "Come on, 
work, you two-bit piece of crap!" 
the figure cried, his fingers dancing over the console to no avail. Flames 
started licking the cockpit of the craft, 
scorching the boy with his every touch. This is it, he thought. I'm going to 
burn to a cinder in the middle of 
nowhere, all because of this STUPID SHIP!!!

	"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!" the boy cried as he punched the console, bringing the 
derelict ship 
back to life, if only for a moment. "Never underestimate brute force," the boy 
mused to himself in relief as he 
jumped to the still-hot console, pushing buttons frantically to put the fires 
out and prepare for landing.

********

	Tenchi squeezed his eyes especially tight just when the ship crashed, his 
clothes billowing around 
him as he held onto Sasami for dear life. It's over, Tenchi thought to himself. 
I'm sorry, Sasami, Ayeka, Ryoko, 
and even you, Washu. I guess I let everyone down...

	"Lord Tenchi, just what do you think you are doing!!!"

	Tenchi opened his eyes to find Ayeka and Ryoko standing right in front of 
him, completely furious. 
"Hey, just what do you think you're doing with her?!" Ryoko snarled, pointing to 
Sasami, who was still being 
held securely in his arms. He instantly released her, and stuttered, "Um, well, 
uh.......it's like this......um.....this....
uh......." Sasami cut in, saying, "Oh, you should have seen it. There was this 
big fireball that was about to hit 
the house, and Tenchi saved me!" She turned around, and hugged Tenchi, much to 
his dismay. "Thank you, 
Tenchi," she said. "You're my hero."

	"Did someone mention something about a fireball?" They all turned to see 
the universe's 
self-proclaimed greatest genius standing nearby, her spiky pink hair fluttering 
slightly from the breeze. "Does 
this have anything to do with that crash a few hundred yards from here?" 

	"Crash? What crash?" both Ryoko and Ayeka asked. "Apparently," Washu said, 
"you two were too 
busy bickering to notice. A ship crashed nearby. From what I could tell, it was 
an older-model Jurian scout ship, 
but it was a bit small. It landed over there." With that, she pointed to the 
northwest, where sure enough, a billow 
of smoke erupted through the treeline.

*********

	The young man heaved the hatch door of the cockpit off and jumped out of 
the burning treeship, his 
blood-red hair now covered in soot, and his clothes scorched, and in a few 
places burned. "Mizzuto," he called 
to his ship, "damage report." A badly-garbled voice rang out:

***DAMAGE REPORT: OVER 80% OF THE INNER HULL --ffzzzzz-- DAMAGED. 14% --
ffzzzzzzz-- 
IRREPARABLE. MAJOR GUIDANCE AND PROPUL--ffzzzzzzz-- MALFUNCTIONS DETECTED...

	The ship computer droned on as he examined his ship. "Just great. Looks 
like I'm stuck here a while." 
He crawled under the belly of the ship for a further examination, when one of 
the panels fell off, smacking him 
hard on the head. He held his head as he muttered a few choice obscenities under 
his breath, then punched the 
ship.

***DANGER: UNIDENTIFIED ENEMY ATTACK. INITIATING COUNTERASSAULT***

	The ship's nose lit up as the worn-out batteries charge up for a single 
blast. The young man continued 
to examine the ship's hull, oblivious to the charge-up. Suddenly, as he was 
examining the aft thrusters, he saw a 
crimson beam just before it slammed into his chest. His turquoise eyes widened 
in horror, and a yell perched 
itself on his lips. The yell never issued, as all the wind had been knocked out 
of his chest when the blast sent 
him sprawling. He tried to sit up weakly, but failed, and fell back over. He 
probed the dull ache in his chest, 
wincing, and found a growing pool of blood. He coughed, and went limp, 
effectively blacking out.
