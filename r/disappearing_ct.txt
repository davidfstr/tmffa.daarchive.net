NOTE:  This story is somewhat 3 months after Ayumi married Yosho. For the full 
story, email me. Ayumi is Washu's second daughter. She escaped Washu's lab and 
wasn't seen until she worked with Ryoko in her crimes. She then betrayed Ryoko 
and later came to earth, where she and Ryoko got in a battle royal. Long story 
short, they made up, she's Ryoko's best friend(er, one of), she married 
Yosho(who now doesn't wear the old man disguise and they have a small house 
instead of living in the shrine), is taking care of an orphaned Juraian baby, 
rivals with Ayeka and believes her 'step-grandson' should marry Ryoko.

Tenchi woke up, stretched, and was delightfully surprised when he didn't awake 
to Ryoko's shocking bloodshot eyes staring at him. Then, something strange 
happened. He tried to grab the door handle, but his hand went right through it!
"What the.... ?!" Tenchi tried pushing on it, and to his surprise, his hand went 
through the door!
"Ayeka!!" He heard, as Ryoko stuck her head through the door. "What did you do 
with Tenchi?!"
"What? Ryoko, stop joking around. I'm right here!" Tenchi couldn't understand.
Ryoko looked the room over once more before leaving. Tenchi hesitated, then 
himself walked through the door. He heard Sasami crying in her room. He couldn't 
open that door either.

"I guess you're playing the mean trick on me too, Tenchi?" Sasami said. "Ayeka 
acted like she couldn't see me!" Then it sunk in. Tenchi just walked through the 
door!!
"How'd you do that??"
"I have no IDEA! But Ryoko couldn't see me either.." Tenchi confessed. Something 
weird was going on, and when weird stuff happened, Washu was usually involved. 
"Come on."
Tenchi held out his hand and took hers in his, and walked through the door. 
Sasami let go, and Tenchi stuck his head back through. "Come on! Somehow we 
can't open doors, so this is the only way." Sasami finally went through it. 
"Wow." She simply said. As she and Tenchi passed by Ryoko..
"What was that?" Ryoko said. She felt something brush past her. "Hello??"
"Hi!" Mihoshi said, walking up.
"Oh, I guess it was you..." And Ryoko left it at that. 

As Tenchi and Sasami went through Washu's door, they saw Washu with a weird 
helmet on. "Oh, hi guys. Just working on reconfiguring some alignments of the 
time space multi-dimensional waves."
She took off the helmet, and gasped. "Where are you guys?!" She put it back on, 
and said simply, "Oops."
"Oops?!" Tenchi couldn't believe that's all she could say.
"I must have shifted the waves to pick up HUMAN signals instead of  plant life, 
like my original idea." Washu scratched her head and chuckled. Ayumi walked 
through the door.
"This isn't a time to laugh! I tried to hug Yosho 'Good Morning', and my arms 
went THROUGH him!!!" She was really peeved. 
"Uh, oops."
"OOPS?!?!?!?!!?!?" Ayumi tried to strangle Washu, and succeeded! She let go, in 
shock.
"What??" Tenchi said.
"How did you do that??" Sasami asked Ayumi.
"How did SHE??" Washu protested, regaining her breathe. "I made myself a multi-
dimensional shield. I can be seen ANYWHERE. How about that, for the #1 genius?
I am FIXING it, but I can't if I'm DEAD. Huh? Still want to strangle 'Mom'?"
"..Mom..." Ayumi wasn't comfortable calling a seemingly 12 year old 'Mom'.
"Anyways! Be patient! I'm working on it! No prob!" Washu said confidently.

"What if more disappear? Like Little baby Hansu." Sasami pointed out.
"Hansu! I bet Yosho is thinking I'm taking care of him!" Ayumi was now on Mommy 
alert.
She ran outside and up to the house and was relieved to see Yosho feeding Hansu.
"Well what'dya know?" She said out loud, though he couldn't hear her. The baby 
started crying, and Yosho calmed him down.
"Ah.. And I thought all men were dense when it came to babies." Ayumi said with 
a smirk, that quickly wiped off when Yosho looked up.
"Hmm?" he said. "Anyone there?"

Ryoko stomped into the lab and grabbed 'her mom' by the collar, lifting her in 
the air.
"Hey 'Mom'! Where is Tenchi?!" Ryoko demanded.
"Now now, little Ryoko." Washu said. "He's right here." She pointed to her left.
"Are you loopy?!" Ryoko heard a silent, muffled sound. a light smoke passed by 
her, and in an instant, she saw Tenchi and Sasami, and as soon as they came, 
they were gone.

"Ryoko! We're right here!" Sasami and Tenchi said together. Ryoko flinched, then 
looked their way. "Ryoko!"

Ayumi sat and watched Yosho. "Hey little one. You know, you mean a lot to 
Ayumi."
he spoke softly. "And not just her, I admit. I've grown fond of you too."
She felt warm tears on her cheeks. "It's not that she has to take care of you. 
She wants to. We want to. You need us. And she.. we... ..I, need you, too."
She'd never seen Yosho act this way. She knew he was the kindest person she'd 
met, but this was totally different. The way he cared for Hansu like she never 
knew he would.
"Hmm. So sweet." She said with misted eyes.
"..Ayumi.." Yosho said.
"What?" Could Yosho hear her?

Tenchi walked out of the lab, and into the living room.
"I'm hungry!" Mihoshi exclaimed.
"Touch that kitchen and you're a dead woman." Ryoko said. She could stand 
starvation, but not Mihoshi's cooking.
"Where is Lord Tenchi?" Ayeka said, worriedly. "Oh, my Tenchi."
"Your Tenchi? Humph." Ryoko said under breath. "Tenchi, where are you??"
Both seemed equally worried. It seemed that time shifted, and he was back in 
Washu's lab.
"Oh, hi guys. Just working on reconfiguring some alignments of the time space 
multi-dimensional waves." She took off the helmet, and gasped. "Where are you 
guys?!" She put it back on, and said simply, "Oops."
"You already said that." Sasami said.
"When?" Washu was confused. "Uh oh. Seems I tampered with the time as well.."

Ayumi found herself back at Washu's lab, as%20well.
"What the.." She was just watching Yosho, and now she was back here.
"Time fluctuation." Washu said.
Ayumi walked out again, and lounged on the couch. *YAWN*
Sasami had left, too. She was outside looking for Ryo-Ohki.

"Ryo-Ohki!" Sasami yelled, and then saw the cabbit hop into the house.
She ran back inside.

Mihoshi screamed as Ryo-Ohki disappeared into thin air.
"Where'd she go?!" Mihoshi gasped.
"Oh my!" Ayeka said.

Tenchi walked out of the lab just in time for Ryo-Ohki to jump on his head.
"Agh! So she's here to, eh?" He rubbed his neck as Ryo-Ohki jumped to Sasami 
when she rushed in the door. "Ryo-Ohki!" Sasami exclaimed.

Suddenly,  Ayeka saw Tenchi, and Ryo-Ohki, and Sasami!
"Sasami!" She cried. But they vanished.
"Tenchi! Are you still there?" Ryoko said, waving her hands through the air, as 
if to feel Tenchi.
"I'm scared!" Mihoshi whined.
"Tenchi..." Ayeka said, as she fell to the ground in a faint.
"Ayeka." Tenchi said.
"Ayeka!" Sasami rushed to her sister's side, only to be useless to her sister.
"...Sasami?.." Ayeka said.
Mihoshi screamed again. "She's gone!"
"Sasami!! Lord Tenchi!" Ayeka exclaimed.
"Howdy Princess." Ayumi said. "Long time, no see... For you.."
"What happened?!" Suddenly, they were all back at Washu's.

"Oh, hi guys. Just working on reconfiguring some alignments of the time space 
multi-dimensional waves." She took off the helmet, and gasped. "Where are you 
guys?!" She put it back on, and said simply, "Oops."
"You already said that! TWICE! But, explain it to Ayeka." Tenchi said.
"I never said.... Oh no! I've set time in a loop!" They all gasped.
They left the lab, all except Ayeka, who listened to the story.
Tenchi went up to his room, only to find Ryoko there, crying. "Tenchi... Where 
are you...?"
"Ryoko, I wish you could see me.." Tenchi sat next to her, and put his hand on 
hers.

"What?" Ryoko felt something. Something on her hand. No one there. "Oh Tenchi! 
Come back to me."

Tenchi left his room, and met Ayeka in the hall. 
"Well, she can't fix it unless she remembers each time the time warps." Ayumi 
said, floating up the steps.
"Oh Lord Tenchi, I'm scared." Ayeka said, leaning on him.
"Really Princess. The moment Ryoko's out of view, you throw your self at her 
man?" Ayumi looked disgusted.
"See here! Tenchi is not 'Her Man'!" Ayeka was fuming.
"Then would you mind getting off of my grandson?" Ayumi said, smugly.
"OFF him? When was I... Never mind, but I resent your ill manner!" Ayeka said.
"Not good if the first thing you do when you meet the parents is insult. Really 
Princess, don't those fancy schools teach you ANYTHING about common sense?"
"Why, you!"
"Tenchi, if you wish to marry, at least let it be to someone with self-control. 
Do that for me, Tenchi." And with that, Ayumi walked off. 
*Sweat drop* *Blush* Tenchi just stood there. And then made his uncomfortable 
laugh.

Ryoko came down stairs, made her threatening note at Washu, and then found out 
what happened. "Tenchi, if you can hear me, I'm going to get you back."

Ayeka's words to Ryoko's statement were, "I bet it's eating her up that I am 
here with you and she is not, Tenchi."
Tenchi looked sorrowfully at Ryoko and reached out, almost like he could touch 
her, but she was too far to reach.
A tear ran down Ayeka's cheek when she saw this. "Lord Tenchi."

Tenchi was lost in the moment. The sorrow for himself, the way Ryoko cared for 
him, then he heard Ayeka say his name. He turned and saw Ayeka's tears. He 
scratched his head and smiled the 'Tenchi Smile'. "Everything's going to be 
fine, Miss Ayeka."
She smiled back at him. "I know, Tenchi."

Ayumi heard and saw the whole conversation. So she was nosy? Who'd know? She 
cared for Ryoko, and she knew somewhere Tenchi had to love her, too, but now she 
was unsure.
But she wouldn't lose hope. She flew down from the rafters. "Hey Tenchi.."

Tenchi looked at her. "Yes? What is it?"
"Tenchi. You can confide in me." Ayumi said. "Why haven't you chosen one or the 
other? The longer you drag this out the more hurt they will be."
"The truth is, I really truly with all my heart..."

Sasami watched as Mihoshi made a mess of the kitchen. She shuddered.
"MIHOSHI!!" Ryoko yelled, walking in. "You aren't helping."
"I'm trying but it's so hard and no one's here and I can't cook and I am scared 
and--" Mihoshi whined. Sasami left before the finish. Washu burst out of her 
lab. 
"I have it!!! A few more buttons and they're back. Time will reverse and you'll 
have no memory. Of course, I will, but you wont!" *cackle* *laugh* Washu really 
was crazy.
Ayumi wanted to remember Yosho, and who Tenchi said he had chosen, or the reason 
why he hasn't chosen yet. She couldn't believe that would happen.
"It's better that way. I shouldn't have told you." Tenchi said, blushing.
*click* "Here we go.." Washu said. Ayeka came up behind him and held Tenchi's 
hand.
They both looked at each other for a second. 

Tenchi woke up, stretched, opened his eyes, and, "Good Morning my Tenchi!" Ryoko 
said, smiling at him. 
"AGHH!! RYOKO!!" Tenchi fell out of bed. And that started a normal(as normal as 
you can get in the Masaki house) beautiful day.

Ayumi: I'm leaving his answer up to you. Don't assume Ayeka, but don't assume 
Ryoko, either. Neither assume nor deny. Just think about it, and hope that he 
made the choice you always hoped he would. ^_~
