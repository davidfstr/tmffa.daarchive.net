"Before Earth and Tenchi Chronicles" Chapter 1-Ryoko,The Space Pirate:
Part 1 of 3
The Story of Ryoko before she crashed to Earth

BOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMM!!! Jurai Police rushed to the scene of the explosion.
"AHAHAHAHA!!"
The Police turned their heads in time to see the space pirates ship
escape the planet of Jurai.

<Space, Inside Ryo-Ohki>

"Another job well done crew!" Exclaimed Ryoko. A spiky blue haired girl
with brown
eyes in a green and black one piece battle suit similar to Ryoko's
responded,
"Yeah Ryoko, you were awesome!"

"Thanks Akina" Said Ryoko in a quieter, deeper voice.Akina blushed
"Aww..
don't thank me, you're the one always doing the work, isn't that right
Magami."

A Woman with long, black hair in an all black kimono turned her head
toward Aki and Ryoko. She said
in a low, deep voice "Well,I guess you are right Akina, unless you call
planing Ryoko's
break in nothing!"

"Geez Magami, cool down" a deep voice came from the shadows

"It's nothing to get worked up about" The figure emerged from the
shadow's, Kagato.

"Kagato, what are you doing here? No one invited you!" Exclaimed Ryoko.

"Now, now Ryoko, I'm your guest" Kagato teased.

An orange blade appeared in Ryoko's hand. Kagato teased again" What do
you plan to
do with that Ryoko?"

Ryoko dashed at Kagato at full speed, took a slash and vaporized. All
Akina and Magami could do was watch with their own laser blades out and
ready in case of
foul play.

Ryoko reappeared next to Kagato and took his hand off with one slash of
the
orange blade. Using his other hand, he grabbed Ryoko's hand, pulled out
his sword, and
slashed.

The crew couldn't take much more. Akina fire energy blasts while Magami
distracted Kagato
by teleporting aroud the room. Ryoko lay there on the floor trying to
regenerate her hand
while Akina and Magami distracted him.

As soon as she was done regenerating, she formed a sword, but it wasn't
an orange blade,
it was a white blade with a wooden handle. Kagato turned around and
gasped.

"The Light Hawk Wings!" Kagato teleported back to a near by Soja and was
gone.

The crew gathered aroud the Light Hawk Blade in Ryoko's hand.

"I thought only people of the Jurain royal blood line were capable of
forming the Light Hawk Wings." Said Magami.

"What are Light Hawk Wings?" Akina asked. Magami answered.

"They are a soure of power that Jurain Trees use. There are a total of
10 wings."

"Then how in the world can Ryoko use Jurian Tree's Power?" Akina
Questioned.

"Hey, why should we be complaining!" Ryoko burst "If this Light Hawk
thing you talk about
is so powerful, why don't we just use it, we'll be unstoppable!"

"You know you're right!"Akina said.

"So" Magami started to say "What are we waiting for! What should we use
this power on?" Ryoko grinned
"Ryo-Ohki! Set a course to Jurai's Royal Palace!"

"Ryoko!" Akina yelled "What are you planning to do there?"

"I used to know the princess when I was young, we never got along
because of her greed.
I heard that she is just as greedy as ever so I'm going to do Jurai a
favor and just, get rid
of her for them!"

"ARE YOU CRAZY!!!!!" Akina Exclaimed. Ryoko swung aroud to face Akina
and thrusted
the Light Hawk Sword within inches of her.

"Don't doubt what damage I can do!" Ryoko yelled. "Ryo-Ohki! Let's
go!!!"

<Royal Palace of Jurai>

"AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!!!! You let them get away!!" An
angry Princess screamed.

"Please Princess Ayeka, calm down" pleaded Azaka

"Don't you tell me to calm down! I told father to not let those
incompetent Space Police to take care of Jurian matters!" Ayeka
screamed.

Masaki walk into the room. "Ayeka" Masaki started to say "We Just got
report of how much money was stolen in the
bank heist by Ryoko and her crew. It was estamated to a near 55
billio..." Before Masaki could
finish her sentance, the space pirate Ryoko's Ship crashed into the
ceiling.

Ryoko, followed by Akina and Magami dropped from the ship.

"Well, well, well" Ayeka said in an evil voice "If it isn't the space
pirate" Ayeka said
in a very cruel manner with a grin on her face. Ryoko kept her confedent
smile. "What
are you so happy about!?" Ayeka spat. Ryoko held out her hand and
clutched the air as
the light hawk sword formed in her hand.

Ayeka lost all of her confidence and look stunned. "What is it
princess?" Ryoko said "What's wrong?" Ayeka had
a hard time talking. "Hu....how....is it that you can have ....the
Li...Light..Hawk...Wu..Wing..s?"

"What? You mean this? Oh, I Guess that it is I who truley deserves to
harness it's power."
Bragged Ryoko "I had some demands in mind, you know, I've alway's wanted
to be a Queen of
my own Planet!!"

"WHAT!!?? NEVER WOULD I LET YOU BE THE QUEEN OF JURAI! YOU DONT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES!!!" Ayeka yelled

"Except for Jurai's greatest power!! THE LIGHT HAWK WINGS!! Ya know, I
don't like that, name,
sounds like some fruity thing some dumb ol' princess would make up. I
like the DARK HAWK WINGS
BETTER, don't you think?"

In her mind, Ayeka was thinking what to do. She wasn't about to give up
Jurai that easily. Then, she had
an idea, she would have to leave Jurai to find a person who was also
capable of using the Light Hawk Wings.
Ayeka, relluctantly gave into Ryoko's demands.

"I knew you'd give in princess!" Akina and Magami congradulated Ryoko.

"Thank very much" Ryoko said "But I have a greater need for you guys.
I need you to be my guards even though with the power I have now I don't
need any."

This began Ryoko's reign of the planet of Jurai while Ayeka searched the
galexy for
someone who could use the Light Hawk Wings.

In the meanwhile... on Jurai

Ryoko has forced the planet into slavery and to obey her every command.

<Jurai Royal Palace,Throne Room>

Ryoko sat on her throne with slaves by her side.

Akina walked into the throne room "Ryoko, it's time" Ryoko Responded
"It's time all ready? Bring
her in!"

Masaki stumbled into the room, her face bloody. "Well Masaki!" Ryoko
stepped down from he throne
"I guess your time is up" Ryoko came face to face with Masaki, then
pushed on the floor. She formed
the Dark Hawk Wing and lifted it. "Now Masaki!" Ryoko yelled "You
DIE!!!!"
