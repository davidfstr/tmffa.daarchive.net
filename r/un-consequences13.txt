A morning to remember, ...or not!

The scene opens with one of the staterooms on the revitalized Ry-ouh, the
Jurai Royal ship given and connected to Ayeka Jurai.
In that state room lay three people in a bed.
one cyan haired laying on her side asleep and snoring lightly. Right next
to her were the other two on the bed.
One laying on the other, all three covered by the beds extra King sized
sheets.
The figure above was breathing heavily as is the one below. The purple
haired Ayeka finally said;
"Tenchi, please don't move!

"But Ayeka, didn't you want to go..."

"No, No my love, I don't want us to be apart. I want us to stay like this
for tonight,
because very soon I cannot be able to lay on you, as I am now because our
growing child will not allow us to."

Tenchi smiled and hugged his fiancé. "I understand my Princess, lets just
keep it down so Ryoko can sleep."

It's Ok Tenchi, with you two always talking afterwards, I have to wait for
you to to shut up before I get my beauty sleep."
Ryoko said as she shifted her position to lay on her stomach.
I also have to agree with Prissy Princess here, It won't be long till we
can't lay on you tummy to tummy for much longer."
Ayeka sighed then laughed! "What's so funny?" Asked a perplexed Ryoko, Now
sitting up on her arm facing her two bed mates.
Imagine 2 months ago (Ayeka giggled) You (she giggled some more) and Me,
(she guffawed) agreeing on anything!
After Ryoko thought about that and joined in the laugh-a-thon with her
future sister in law.
Tenchi was simply taking this in and smiled a grand and happy smile.
he just couldn't help it, having both of his loves laughing, and happy with
him, and each other.
He didn't even notice the tears coming down his cheeks, but his loves did.
"Tenchi Babe, are you all right?" Ryoko asked surprised at the tears and
the smile.
"Tenchi darling, Are you upset.?" Ayeka now had a hand on his face wiping
one side while Ryoko wiped the other.
It's ok girls, ... I'm just so proud of you two. Being able to be this
close and not really fight, becoming friends and willing to share my love.
Well there is just so much I can say, but I think this will convey what I
feel about you two.

He kissed Ryoko passionately. "I love you my space Pirate and I can never
say that I would be bored with you around."
They chuckled. Then he turned to the woman laying on his chest and
passionately kissed her.
To My one and only princess of my heart, you are my, ... no our anchor to
steady our lives and we can count on you to be there for us both.
Ayeka, and Ryoko were the ones now tearing up, they fiercely hugged Tenchi
he returned that in full.
Now Lets get some sleep and we'll continue this ...tomorrow.
Both girls nodded and pecked him on each cheek, and the three settled down
for the night.

Cravings, and morning sickness, Oh Crap!

The morning came and after a few warm moments Ayeka, Ryoko, and Tenchi
walked down to Ry-ouh's dining area,
where the rest of the Masaki clan was there waiting for them to join them.
As they started to eat and enjoy each others company with familiar
conversations Things abruptly stopped.

Ryoko usually the most boisterous and animated of the family was looking
quiet, pasty and slightly unnerved.
Ayeka, and Tenchi took a hand each and looked at their friend and love.
She then took one hand to cover her mouth and phased to the bathroom
nearby.
The sounds of wretching was heard as Ayeka, and Washu rushed outof the
dining room,
leaving the rest of the family quiet and with concerned looks.

After a few minutes Ryoko, supported by Ayeka and Washu was taken back to
the room she shared with Ayeka and Tenchi.
Then Washu returned and the family patiently waited for her prognosis.
"Well It looks like Ryoko is the first of us ladies to get morning
sickness." The family took that with some apprehension.
She then added;" that means I'll probably be the next one to be affected,
then Mihoshi, and finally Ayeka."
 Sasami then asked, "How do you know who will get this next, Washu?" She
snickered but continued,
"Because I am most closely related to Ryoko, I would logically be next,
followed by Mihoshi since she is also related to me though not as close as
Ryoko. And Ayeka would be last since she is Jurian and they have a similar
pregnancy schedule as most earth women,so this order of events will follow
as well."
"Huh" said Nobuyuki

Washu rolled her eyes and simplified her explanation, "It means that the
order I said for us to get morning sickness will probably be the order for
us to have our babies, Ryoko first, then me, then Mihoshi, then finally
Ayeka."

So, we'll need help because when you're in the middle of labor, none of us
will have to be trained to help you or the others
in the birthing process." said a now animated Mihoshi who was
uncharacteristically angry, not at Washu per say,
but at the possibility that if Washu was hurt during her labor, how would
that affect her twins birth?
Well, I have already thought of that, The GP is sending someone to replace
you until you can resume your duties and so I requested an officer with
training in prenatal birth and Pediatrics, and do you know who was
available, My little Mihoshi?"
(Washu had started calling her that since she knew she was her grandmother)

No, Washu who?" Washu smiled.
You former partner, Kiyone Makabi!" Mihoshi did a serious look, then, ...
fainted.
Nobuyuki was at her side immediately and Washu a few seconds later with
smelling salts.

Then the family was told of Kiyone's and Mihoshi's past as GP officers
partnered up since
they got out of the GP academy. Mihoshi at that time was a very serious
officer with Kiyone as her back up.
They related the incident and how Mihoshi had thought her partner dead
because of her mistake with  mad scientist trying to destroy the universe.
Tenchi then recalled the story Mihoshi had related to them almost 2 years
ago.
So that story ... was real?" Asked Ayeka. "Yes of course! What would I
lie?" replied Mihoshi.
Then everyone acknoledge the fact that Mihoshi never lied.
Now she was not only alive, but coming here, to help her. It was simply too
much even for her.

As the revelations were coming a red starship was heading for Ry-ouh's
position, with Kiyone Makabi piloting.
She knew the situation and normally would have been on the other side of
the universe,
but when she found out that one of those pregnant was Mihoshi.
She then asked for by the famous Professor Washu who's work
she had admired since she was a child, she relented and now on the Yagami
headed for the rendezvous
with the Jurian Starship.

Jurai's Reaction!

As Funaho and Misaki were the Queens of Jurai, they controlled the news
that the media
would put out not only to the empire, but to the rest of the universe.
So, they used the trip their to inform the identity and arrival of the next
Prince,
and Princesses of Jurai. Though, Yousho Ayeka and Sasami were known,
the information regarding Nobuyuki, Mihoshi, Tenchi wasn't too hard to get
out and put a good spin on.
But when it came to Washu, and Ryoko,
they decided to keep their identities quiet until they could present
through the media video presentations
of The Kagato incident, and The apprehension of Dr. Clay, and Lord Garyu's
fight with Ayeka
Then to top it all off, the challenges of Sariyo, and Ito on Tenchi would
be shown before
the announcement of their marriages and titles.
So, the populous was slowly made aware first of Ayeka's and Sasami's
whereabouts, as well as Yousho's,
but also of Tenchi, and finally Ryoko and their associations with each
other.
There were protests from various groups who objected to Ryoko, Tenchi,
Ayeka's marriage to them,
Yousho's return, and even one minor group who objected to Nobuyuki's
inclusion in the Royal family.
So the Queen's put a special spin on all of them. Acknowledging the Kagato
incident, to Dr. Clay's capture,
they put the best foot forward to put the Masaki clan in a better light to
the Jurai people.

Most of the populous approved of most of them simply because of their
exploits, as well as
but those small splinter groups could become a point of concern,
so using their positions as Captain of the Emperor's guard, and Head of
Intelligence, they slowly,
methodically either disbanded, or severely disrupted each groups
organization and movements.
They hoped that with all they had done, nothing could happen that would
jeopardize their family.
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Attack on the way!

But not all of those objecting to the new members of the Royal Family were
so low or unorganized.
Lord Ito who was for now in prison, had some of his supporters hire
mercenaries,
and added them to the growing force gathering in the Mutara Nebula.
A great place to hide, right next to the where Ry-ouh was going to pass by
on it's way to Jurai.

That night Lord Ito was broken out of one of Jurai's Maximum security
Prison,
and a bounty of 100 million Jurai was posted.A certain bounty hunter then
took up a trail for Ito.
That bounty hunter would keep a step just behind Ito, and knew that sooner
rather than later,
she would catch up to him, so, she kept Ken-Oki in pace with Ito and his
gathering forces.

An anonymous tip was given to Jurai Intelligence abut Ito's activities, so
The Queens,
with King's knowledge and approval sent a quick strike force to make sure
that their children wouldn't be harmed.
But, unknown to them, A confederate of Ito's warned him and his force of
the rescue attempt.
So, the Rebels then took off to find Ry-ouh and Ito was going to have his
revenge for his loss of prestige,
of power, hold the Jurai progency hostage and he was going to get his
little brother back, whether he liked it or not.
Yota felt his former brother coming for him, but he was asleep and being
told what he had to do, from an entity.
A being of immense age and power. But a being who also wanting her sisters
back,
and Ito's plans would do for her, so she programmed Yota to be ready for
the attack.
No maniacal Jurian was going to ruin her plans for her sisters, or their
family.
