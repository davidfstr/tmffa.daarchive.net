Prologue:  The Awaking of an Old Enemy

"Where am I?  Tell me!!!!!" a person said in pain.
"That I can't tell you, for you are not ready to know."
"You know damned well that I'm ready, seeing that you were stupid enough to 
bring back to this world."
"No, you're not.  Your new body is not fully functional.  If I let you out, you 
won't last a minute.  So shut up and stay in that statis pod.  You're lucky 
enough that I even brought you back, nevertheless why I did."
	The person, who was dressed in black and purple robes, floating in what to 
look like a tank filled with yellow water.  The person look around in his new, 
although less friendly, environment.  The whole room is shroad in darkness, 
except a blink of light that came from a table on the right.
"Probably a scientist, dumb probably, if he can keep me here" He snickered at 
the thought.  He reached for the outer glass and was about to break it...
"I wouldn't if I were you.  We took the precaution to take away your powers 
until you are ready."
"Fuck you!!!  Why do you even bother!!!!!"  He said as his hand/claw retracted 
back to his side in pain.
"Oh, by the way,  the fact that we are scientist is partly true, in a matter of 
speaking.  The statis pod you're in is in fact scientific, but the process to 
bring you back is merely black magic."
"So, you're mages.  What luck" he sneered.
"Watch it, or we will send you back to Hell in which you died"
"When did you became two people, or am I not ready for that either?"  He 
laughed.
	The person who he was talking to finally step forward to what little light 
there is.  The so-called "mage" was a cross between a Jurian lion on a bad hair 
day and a robot half built.  The body was unknown silver metal with a Jurian 
symbol meaning "power" covered in body hair.  The head was part lion, part robot
(If you seen Frieza in Dragon Ball Z when Trunks was fighting him, you will 
kinda know what he looks).  All he was wearing is a black cloak with the hood 
uncovered.
"Damn, and all this time I thought there was two people talking to me!!!!"
"There is, you fool.  The body you see before you is merely a vehicle to contain 
two souls.  We must do so in order for my 'friend' to survive" the body said, 
but in a more deeper, Cajun voice.
"Why did you even bother!  I can escape from Sub-space anyway.
"Ha, you couldn't find your way out of a pickle jar, not in your condition. 
Remember what happen to you that brought you into sub-space in the first place."
	The person in the pod began to think back to what it seems it was 
yesterday...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------
"This will stop.  I won't allow it!!!  Because repentance is never an option you 
a creature like you!!"

"What is this power!!!!"

"You alive!!!"
"The House of Jurai will not escape me!!!"

"Dimensional cannon, FIRE!!"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
The person shuddered in fear, the only other emotion he had besides revenge and 
madness.  Wondering why he was brought back was no concern to him because nobody 
can kill him, until that damn woman decided to step out and give him one heck of 
a headache.
"Now you know why we brought you back, to give you a second chance at revenge."
"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU!!!"
"That is not your concern.  The only concern now that you're not ready yet.  In 
due time, you will know, " the other voice from the body said.  In response, the 
body turned and disappeared with a haunting message.
"You will be released, but don't even think about killing me or you will die 
with me.  I got big plans for the three of us..."
The person in the pod just floated there and thinking of the situation.
"Damn, he's one fucking idiot to even threaten me.  After my revenge, I be after 
him." He laughed at his own thoughts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
"You think that bringing him back was a good idea?"
"No, besides, I placed a few of my own cells within him so he will be following 
my every command as my follower in no time."
"Good.  Phase I is completed.  Ooooooo, how revenge is so sweeet!!!"
"Yes, it is. Let's begin Phase II."
"Fine.  Set the gate to coordinates to 120U-P point LK and..."
"Why use the gate?  We can just teleport the whole lab to those coordinates."
"Oh, I forgot..."

"Hi!!  My name is Sasami.  You won't believe what happens next!  You see..."
"Quiet, Sasami.  We don't want to spoil the next episode."
"Kiyone, you're no fun.  All I want to say is that Tenchi..."
"Sasami, let them find out.  Besides, Tenchi wants to tell them himself!"
"Fine, the next episode in this fanfic is called 'Tenchi Chooses....Finally'"
