			 Chapter 3: Into the Unknown 

	Tenchi lay in his bed awake and staring at the ceiling. His eyes 
looked outside the window now and then but it was mostly at the ceiling. He
looked on as hundreds of thoughts ran through his head.
	'What am I going to do? Kagato was bad enough and now I have to deal
with this guy,' he thought then sighed. "I'm in for it now."
	"Tenchi?" Ryoko called softly, fazzing through the door.
	"Oh Ryoko, its only you," Tenchi said and sat up in his bed. Ryoko
flew next to him and sat down.
	"Tenchi, I...I want to tell you something, and I don't want you to 
think any less of me than you ever did, okay?" she asked looking at him in
the eyes.
	"Well, sure Ryoko, what is it?"
	"Its just that...I'm....scared," she said looking down. Tenchi 
looked down at her and smiled.
	"I don't blame you," he responded and she looked at him in surprise. 
"To tell you the truth, I'm kinda doubting myself."
	"No..."
	"Yeah, I almost feel like we are getting prepaired for nothing."
	"Thats not true Tenchi, you could do it."
	"No, I don't think so, not this time."
	"Listen to yourself!" Ryoko yelled and got up. "You sound like 
you've given up when we havn't even tried yet!"
	"Ryoko, I..."
	"Save your breath Tenchi, I can see I'll just have to take this 
Atmos guy on myself. Too bad you wont be there by my side Tenchi, I was 
hoping for your support." Tenchi smiled and got up. He moved to Ryoko and 
gave her a hug. 
	"Sorry, I promise I'll be there, just for you guys." He released
Ryoko and she smiled at Tenchi.
	"I'm so happy now! Well, I better let you get back to sleep, 
goodnight," she said and fazzed through the door. Tenchi crawled back into
the bed and went to sleep.
	Out in the hallway, Ryoko stood in front of Tenchi's door with her
hand against it, looking down. A tear came to her eye and she wipped it 
away and smiled again. 
	"So, did you talk him into it?" Washu asked walking up to Ryoko.
	"Yeah, I think I got the message across," she said looking down at
Washu who smiled.
	"Thank you sweetie." Ryoko smiled and laughed a bit.
	"Sure thing, mom." They both laughed a bit and Ryoko disappeared 
into her room. Washu walked down the stairs and into her lab to work the
rest of the night.

	Galvatros zoomed across the galaxy after leaving Tokimi's palace. 
Atmos smiled as he watched the monitor. 
	"Soon, very soon, I will have Jurai begging on its knees for me not
to destroy it. And no one, not even the boy with the Light Hawk Wings, can
stop me," he said and laughed evily. The ship started to beep and shake as
spurts of gun fire grazed the hull.
	"Galvitros raise the sheilds and show me whats behind us!" Atmos
yelled and a monitor came down from the ceiling. He looked into it and saw
four Galaxy Police battle cruisers. He frowned and watched them fire another
barage.
	"Damn the GP, don't they know that I can't be beaten with such puny
weapons?" he asked himself then smirked. "I'll show them then." He grabbed
the controls to Galvitros and throttled up. He flew forward a bit then back 
toward the  cruisers. The large war machines fired upon him as he flew 
through the bullets and rockets. Atmos smiled evily and flipped a clear
plastic cover open. He turned Galvatros around and stopped behind the other
ships.
	"This ought to do it," he said and he pushed a red button that was
concealed by the cover. A beam shot out of the front of Galvitros and 
obliterated one of the GP battle cruisers. The other three launched smaller 
ships to attack. 
	"Galvatros, you attack those crusiers, I'll attack the smaller 
craft," Atmos said and teleported out into space. Galvatros flew off toward
the GP craft while Atmos created a red energy sword. He attacked a spaceship
coming at him and sliced it in half. He swung at another one above him,
destroying it and sending a piece of it at another ship. Atmos disappeared 
and sliced two more quickly before reappearing and stabbing another ship in 
its thrusters.
	"I grow weary of this battle, I shall end this now," Atmos said 
and he created a shield of energy around himself. He spun around like a top 
and little needles of energy flew at the GP spacecraft. They expolded when 
touched by the spikes and Atmos was surrounded by the explosions. Galvatros 
floated next to him and rumbled. Atmos looked up to it and smiled. 
	"So, they were no problem?" Atmos asked. The ship rumbled again and
Atmos fazzed into the ship. He pushed a button on the control panel. It 
sped away into a nebula, dodging the pieces of metal that littered the area.
	"No need to keep Tokimi waiting, eh Galvatros?" The ship rumbled
once again and accelerated.

	The morning on Earth started extreamly slow as Ryoko opened the door
to her room and lurched out into the living room. The living room was 
relitivly quiet. The only sound that could be heard was the chopping and
bubbling that came from the kitchen. 
	Ayeka walked out of the bathroom and looked down at the empty 
living room but then noticed Ryoko moving over to the couch. She decided to
walk down and join Ryoko. 
	Tenchi came through the door that led to the kitchen and saw Ryoko
and Ayeka sitting as quietly as possable. He scrathed his head as he stared 
at them in amazement. 
	'This has got to be the first time I've ever seen them so quiet 
together,' Tenchi thought as he walked over to them.
	"Good morning Ryoko, Miss Ayeka!" They both jumped out of their 
seats in surprise. Tenchi jumped back also.
	"I'm sorry, I honestly didn't mean to scare you." 
	"Well, I suppose we're all a bit jumpy after this whole Atmos deal,"
Ayeka stated and Ryoko nodded her head in agreement.
	"Oh, I see."
	"Say, when's breakfast gonna be ready?" Ryoko asked bluntly.
	"In a few seconds."
	"Always thinking about food, you really disgust me," Ayeka said.
	"Well, pardon me for being hungry miss perfect!"
	"Better perfect than a monster!"
	"What was that!" Ryoko yelled and charged up.
	"You heard me!" Ayeka yelled back and began to do the same thing. 
Tenchi backed up and began to try to talk to them.
	"Ladies please, don't make things worse!" The energy within the room 
began to create a storm inside the house. Washu suddenly burst through the 
door to her lab and began to stare at Ayeka and Ryoko. They stopped to look 
at her. She was panting rapidly until she finally managed to take a deep 
breath. 
	"I know where he's heading," she said in excitement.

	A large planet rose into the window of Galvatros as it fired the 
reverse thrusters to slow down. Atmos got up out of the chair in the 
navigation deck and walked to the window.
	"Hades . . . a planet that was stowed away from the rest of the
universe for ages. Soon you will be awakened, and then, I will make sure 
you and I get the revenge on Jurai that we so desire," Atmos said. 
Galvatros rumbled and Atmos began to chuckle. 
	"So, Lady Tokimi has arrived has she." Galvatros rumbled once more
and Atmos teleported out of the ship.
	He appeared above the planet Hades. He reached out to the planet but
a purple lightning bolt came out of the atmosphere. It struck his hand and
he drew it back. The bolt caused a purple ball twice the size of the planet 
to show up around it. As Atmos stared at the shield a shadow engulfed
Atmos and the planet. He spun about to see a giant ship hovering over him.
A smile came about his face as he bowed toward it.
	"My lady, I am happy to see you have come!" he exclaimed. Tokimi
soon appeared before him, sparkling from an unknown energy from a bottomless
resource. She stared angrily at him but then raised her hand. The purple
shield soon flashed and showed itself. Bolts of energy soon started to 
crawl around it. Flashes and crackles filled up space. Suddenly, the sheild
exploded in hundreds upon millions of pieces. Atmos began to laugh and he
turned to Tokimi.
	"You are too kind my lady," he said as he stared at her face and 
bowed. She still had anger in her face and she spoke up.
	"Just bring me Washu," she said.
	"But . . . I'm going to need a place I can get energy from."
	"Fine, I will give you the original four moons that circled the 
planet. The four moons that fueled the planet with so much evil." She raised
her hand again and soon four blue orbs circled the desert planet. She 
disappeared into the ship and it pulled away. He disappeared himself and 
reappeared on the surface of the planet. 
	It was a barren place; winds kicked up the loose dust and metal 
that littered the surface. Two moons showed up against the black blanket 
once known as a sky. Atmos turned to a single star in the sky and pointed
to it.
	"Jurai," he said plainly and smiled. "I'm sure Washu tracked me down
by now . . . I should get ready."

	"Hades?" Tenchi asked staring at Washu. They all sat around her in
the living room. She nodded her head and leaned back in her chair.
	"Yes, it was a planet that once slayed hundreds of civilizations,"
Washu explained. "I found this little tidbit out after Ayeka and Ryoko gave
my computer a little energy boost."
	"How?" Sasami asked.
	"It's simple really, I knew that eventually they were gonna get into
a fight, so I put energy absorbers in the living room, the kitchen, and all
of our rooms. After I colected the sample I mutated it and found that the
mutated energy is the same patteren as the reading I got from Atmos." 
	"Well, what does he intend to do on that planet?" Ayeka asked.
	"Destroy Jurai," she said gravely and everyone gasped and looked 
at each other. "Listen, if he destroys Jurai, then there will be nothing 
to stop him from conquering the universe."
	"What about Tenchi?" Ryoko blurted out.
	"Not even the Light Hawk Wings can defeat him, at least not without
a little bit of Juraian influance."
	"So then what?" Ayeka asked desperatly.
	"Well, at 2 AU, I believe the energy that Juraian trees give off 
would reach him, so if we fight him on Hades then we should be okay."
	"Alright next question, does anyone know where Hades is?" Ryoko 
asked.
	"I do!" Mihoshi yelled standing up. Everyone looked at her in 
surprise. She smiled an air-headed smile as they watched her in wait for her
answer.
	"It's down there," she said and pointed to the ground. Everyone 
sighed as she sat down.
	"Thank you Mihoshi," Washu said sarcastically. "Anyway, I'm glad you
asked that question Ryoko, because we can find it with this!" 
	She pulled out a small device from sub-space and everyone looked
at it. It was a small box-shaped object that almost looked like a hearing
aid.
	"Wait a minute, is that what I think it is?" Ryoko asked pointing
toward it.
	"Yep, Mr. Tracker IV."
	'Great, another weird device made by Washu!' Tenchi thought to 
himself. 'Wait a minute . . . what about the other three?'
	"With this, we'll be able to find Hades within seconds. But we need
to be in space for this to work."
	"Well what the hell are we all sitting around here for? Lets go!" 
Ryoko yelled enthusiastically. Everyone got worked up over the excitment and
rushed to their rooms to prepair for space.
