Pioneer owns the copyrights to Tenchi Muyo and to all the 
characters there in.  I wish I owned them so I could be producing
more anime.  Please see the prelude to this series for explanations 
on the screen play annotations, and new character descriptions.  
As with the OVA this is rated PG13 due to depictions of nudity, 
violence, and sexual innuendo.

TEASER

FADE IN:

INT. Washu's lab - DAY (Wednesday, 9 July 1997)

Tenchi stands over Ayeka looking at her.  Ryoko and Ryoe are in two other
beds.

Ayeka opens her eyes and looks up at Tenchi.

TENCHI
Hello Ayeka.

AYEKA
The others?

TENCHI
Look to your right.  They will both be okay.

Ayeka looks to her right.

AYEKA
And Daijiro?

TENCHI
Little Washu brought him back from the dead.  I will show you latter.
Are you ready to get up now?

Ayeka sits up and realizes she had nothing on under the sheet.

She quickly covers herself.

Tenchi holds out a robe and turns his head.

Ayeka takes the robe and gets out of bed.

She puts on the robe and takes Tenchi's arm.

AYEKA
I'm ready now.

Tenchi smiles at her.

Both leave the lab.

INT. Dining room - DAY

Grandfather, Kazuhiko, Washu, Sasami, Mihoshi, and Kiyone sit at the
table.

Sasami looks at Tenchi's plate.

SASAMI
Tenchi has not been out of your lab since we got here.

Washu summons up her holographic keyboard.

She pushes a few buttons and the keyboard displays a count down starting
at 1 minute and 43 seconds.

WASHU
That is how long you have to get another place setting Sasami.

Sasami rushes off to the kitchen and brings out another setting with food.

The screen counts down to zero as Washu points at the door.

Tenchi is holding Ayeka as they both walk in.

Washu's keyboard disappears.

Sasami runs over and hugs Ayeka.

SASAMI
I missed you Ayeka.  Are you okay now?

AYEKA
Yes Sasami I feel much better now.  I see you set a place for me.

SASAMI
Yes you and Tenchi both sit down.

MIHOSHI
You look much better than when I last saw you Ayeka.

AYEKA
Thank you Mihoshi.  Hello Kiyone.

KIYONE
Hello Princess Ayeka.

AYEKA
Please just Ayeka, anytime anywhere.  This looks good Sasami and I am
really hungry.

Everyone begins to eat.

AYEKA
Tenchi tells me that we are still on the desert planet.

KIYONE
Yes we can leave at anytime, but we were waiting for everyone to get
better.

AYEKA
We must not forget about Ryo-Ohki either.  I believe she will be ready
in another six or seven days.

WASHU
Do you know where her egg is?

AYEKA
I don't think I can find it again.  We will have to wait for Ryoko.

Everyone continues to eat.

MIHOSHI
We have not sent any messages to Jurai yet.  I wanted to wait until after
talking with you.  Do you want to send any?

AYEKA
No it can wait until I get there in person.  Then I will have plenty to 
say.

SASAMI
Has anything changed Ayeka?

AYEKA
No Sasami, you are the Crown Princess.

Kiyone looks over at Sasami with a questioning look.

AYEKA
I gave up my title when I defied the Emperor.

KIYONE
Defied how?

TENCHI
She has agreed to marry me.

KIYONE
I thought you married Ryoko.

TENCHI
I did.  I will have at least two wives.  There is room for a third if you
are interested Kiyone.

Everyone stares at Tenchi.

TENCHI
That was a joke Kiyone.  I am sorry if I hurt your feelings.  What I meant
is under Jurai law I can have three wives.

Kiyone laughs.

KIYONE
Be careful Tenchi.  If you ask me again I might just accept.

Everyone joins in the laughter.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Washu's lab - NIGHT

Tenchi sits between Ryoko and Ryoe.  He is holding Ryoko's hand.

Ayeka walks in.

AYEKA
You love her, don't you Lord Tenchi?

TENCHI
Yes I love her, and I am worried for her.  I don't mean to neglect you
Ayeka.

Ayeka moves to the other side of Ryoko.

She brushes her hand across Ryoko's cheek.

AYEKA
I don't feel neglected.  I do feel lonely.

Tenchi lets go of Ryoko's hand and moves behind Ayeka.

He wraps his arms around her.

TENCHI
Soon we will be wed.

AYEKA
Yes.

TENCHI
There is no joy in your voice.

AYEKA
I don't think I can live up to Ryoko.
 
Tenchi spins Ayeka around and uses his hands to hold her face.  

He looks her in the eye. 

TENCHI
Who said you had to live up to Ryoko?  Was it something she said?

AYEKA
No, no one said it.  I just look at you looking at her.  I don't feel
adequate to compete with her.
 
Tenchi lets go of her face and hugs her tightly.

TENCHI
Do you remember our walk through the autumn leaves?  Do you remember the
time I gave you that hot sweet potato?  Do you remember the look in my
eyes then?

Ayeka begins to cry.

AYEKA
That was so long ago.  So much has changed since then.

TENCHI
Yes, I have grown up.  I will not let you go Ayeka.  Ryoko accepts you as
her sister.  Can you do the same?

AYEKA
I already have Tenchi.  You have fun with Ryoko because she is so free.
I like to play it safe.  I am so ordinary.

TENCHI
If you are ordinary then please protect me from the unusual.

AYEKA
I love you Lord Tenchi.  I love you.  Do you love me?

Tenchi holds up her head and wipes away the tears.

TENCHI
That was hard for you to say.  How often did you want to say that but
couldn't because duty and obligation stood in your way?

AYEKA
Duty and obligation are all I know Tenchi.  I do not give them up lightly.

TENCHI
I know Ayeka.  I love you with all of my heart.
 
Tenchi kisses Ayeka.

AYEKA
I do not want to be alone tonight.

Tenchi takes her hand and they walk out of the lab.

INT. Washu's Lab - DAY (Saturday, 12 July 1997)

Tenchi stands looking down at Ryoe holding her hand.

Ryoe opens her eyes.

TENCHI
Welcome back Ryoe.

RYOE
I'm alive then?

TENCHI
Yes.

Ryoe begins to cry.

RYOE
Why?

TENCHI
Little Washu took care of you.

RYOE
No.  I don't want to be here.

TENCHI
Please Ryoe, I have some juice and soup here for you.

RYOE
We had so much left to do.

TENCHI
Please drink this.

Ryoe pushes the drink away.

RYOE
Are Ayeka and Ryoko all right?

TENCHI
Yes, they both will be fine.

RYOE
Then you wouldn't understand.  Just leave me alone.

TENCHI
What wouldn't I understand? Death, loneliness, lost love, or maybe
shattered dreams.  Please eat or drink something.

RYOE
Just go away and let me die!

TENCHI
I can't do that Ryoe.  I need you to live.

RYOE
Damn you just leave me alone!  Go away!

TENCHI
I have to show you something.

RYOE
I don't care anymore!

Tenchi picks up Ryoe still covered in her sheet.

Ryoe pounds her fists against Tenchi's chest.

RYOE
Put me down!  I don't want to live like this!

Tenchi ignores her protests and move to the far door.

RYOE
Damn you Tenchi.  It hurts!  It hurts too much.

They both exit out the far lab door.

INT. Washu's second lab - DAY

A tall glass cylinder with a rod out the side sits in the room.

Ryoe continues to hit Tenchi and protest against living.

Tenchi carries her over to the cylinder.

TENCHI
This is what I want you to see.

RYOE
I don't care!

TENCHI
It's Daijiro.

RYOE
What?

TENCHI
It's Daijiro at the end of that tube.

Ryoe looks at the cylinder.

RYOE
I don't understand.

TENCHI
Little Washu cloned Daijiro.

RYOE
A clone?

TENCHI
In eight and a half months you will have Daijiro back.

RYOE
Damn you!  I can't live with his baby!  It would kill me!

TENCHI
Ryoe, Ryoe, we wouldn't do that to you.  Washu has accelerated his growth.

Ryoe stops crying.

TENCHI
In eight and a half months he will be eighteen years of age.  He will
look like the Daijiro you remember.

Ryoe reaches out to touch the cylinder.

TENCHI
There is a catch.

Ryoe grimaces.

RYOE
There always is.

TENCHI
He was dead three hours before Little Washu could copy his memories. 
Memories start fading at death.

RYOE
How much will he lose?

TENCHI
He will lose up to a year in memories.

RYOE
He may not remember that we are married?

TENCHI
True, but he will remember the reasons why he married you.

Ryoe leans her head against Tenchi's chest.

RYOE
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  Please thank Washu for me.

TENCHI
You can tell her yourself.

Tenchi sets Ryoe on her feet and her sheet falls off.

Washu enters the scene and wraps a robe around Ryoe.

Ryoe begins crying on Washu's shoulder.

Both hug each other as Washu gently lowers her to the ground.

Tenchi slips out of the room.

INT. Washu's lab - DAY (Monday, 14 July 1997)

Tenchi and Ayeka sit to either side of Ryoko.

Both hold one of her hands.

Ryoko opens her eyes and they both lean over her.

RYOKO
Where am I?

TENCHI
Yagami.  We are still on the desert planet in the KAL system.

Ryoko closes her eyes and then opens them again.

RYOKO
Washu is here.

TENCHI
Yes both Washu and Sasami are alive and well.

RYOKO
How long have I been laying here?

AYEKA
Seven days.  We have some juice and soup for you.

Ryoko sits up and the sheet falls away from her.

RYOKO
Good, I'm starved.

She quickly finishes the juice and soup.

AYEKA
Would you like some more?

Ryoko nods her head.

TENCHI
Let's go back into the house then.

Tenchi hands Ryoko a robe.

Ryoko gets out of the bed and puts it on.

All three leave the lab.

INT. Family room - DAY

The room is dark.

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka walk in.

The lights come on.  The room is festively decorated.

GROUP
Welcome home Ryoko.
 
Grandfather, Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyone, Sasami, Kazuhiko, and Ryoe gather
around to give Ryoko a hug.

Tenchi holds Ayeka's hand as they stand off to one side.

RYOKO
Thank you.

The table is piled with food and drink.

While everyone attacks the food Kiyone uncovers a box.

It's her karaoke machine.

Mihoshi and Kiyone lead off with the first song.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

The door opens and Tenchi and Ryoko walk in hand in hand.

Ryoko takes several deep breaths.

RYOKO
Have you and Ayeka been doing it?

Tenchi does not rise to the bait.

TENCHI
You know Ayeka too well to even ask that question.

RYOKO
Thank you for holding my hand.

TENCHI
How do you know that?

RYOKO
When I was trapped in the cave I could leave it in spirit form.  That's
how I watched you grow up.

TENCHI
You could do the same in Washu's lab?

RYOKO
Yes, but I couldn't leave the lab.  No matter how hard I tried I couldn't
touch you.

TENCHI
You could see and hear everything?

RYOKO
Yes.
 
Tenchi hugs Ryoko tightly.

TENCHI
I'm so sorry.  She wanted to tell you but she couldn't.  Little Washu
knew it was her fault, and she was afraid you would never forgive her.

RYOKO
It's okay Tenchi.  You always know what to say.  When we decide to have
a child I would be happy to make your dream come true.

TENCHI
I do want children Ryoko.

RYOKO
But not until we have dealt with the Lady first.

TENCHI
Yes, can you wait that long?

RYOKO
I can wait, but can Ayeka?

TENCHI
I don't know.  The Lady does not fear her child.

RYOKO
Thank you for taking care of Ayeka.  If she would let go of her fear of
being less than perfect she would be a lot more fun.  Does she still feel
inadequate when compared to me?

TENCHI
I have tried to convince her otherwise.  I don't think I am getting 
through to her.  I love her Ryoko, but my love for her is different than
my love for you.  I think she sees that and I don't know how to change my
love for the both of you.

RYOKO
It's not for you to change Tenchi.  I know you love her in a way you
don't love me.  I accept that because we are different in your eyes.
Wait until after the wedding before you worry too much about Ayeka's
feeling of inadequacy.

TENCHI
The two of you have changed a great deal over the last two years.

RYOKO
We discovered that we could both win.

Ryoko kisses Tenchi.

RYOKO
Make love to me Tenchi.

Tenchi picks up Ryoko and sets her down on the bed.

RYOKO
After we are finished I will invite Ayeka in to share our bed.

Tenchi slowly undresses Ryoko.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom door - NIGHT

Ayeka walks by with her lips moving, but making no sound.

Ayeka walks by again silently speaking and moving her hands.

As Ayeka walks by a third time the door open.

Ryoko stands naked in the doorway.

Ayeka stares at the floor.

Mihoshi walks by with a tray loaded with snacks.

MIHOSHI
Good night to the both of you.  Sleep well.

AYEKA
Is there anything she doesn't know?

RYOKO
Tenchi says that nothing escapes the notice of that police detective.
Well don't just stand there.  Come on in.

Ayeka enters and the door closes.

INT. Dining room - DAY (Wednesday, 16 July 1997)

Everyone is gathered for breakfast.

Grandfather sits at the head near the kitchen.  Kazuhiko sits at the
other end.  To Grandfather's right sits Ayeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ryoe.
To his left sits Sasami, Kiyone, Mihoshi, and Washu.

Ryoko suddenly drops her chopsticks.

RYOKO
It is time.

TENCHI
Time for what?

RYOKO
Time to get Ryo-Ohki.

Sasami claps her hands in joy.

SASAMI
I have really missed her.  I made a big carrot cake just for her.

KIYONE
I can fly the Yagami to Ryo-Ohki's location.  Please come up to the
bridge with me Ryoko.

Kiyone and Ryoko leave the room.

The rest finish their breakfast.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Kiyone and Ryoko enter the bridge.

Kiyone takes one of the chairs while Ryoko stands behind her.

KIYONE
Prepare for low altitude flight Yagami.

YAGAMI
Yes Lieutenant.

RYOKO
How did you get promoted to Lieutenant?

KIYONE
After I left Earth to return to Galaxy Police Headquarters I received
a reassignment.  I was transferred to Special Operations as Galaxy Police
Headquarters' liaison officer.

YAGAMI
Ready to go Lieutenant Kiyone.

RYOKO
We need to go due west.

KIYONE
Heading 270 degrees at one hundred feet please.

The ship lifts off and the terrain moves in the view screen.

RYOKO
Did you used to work for Special Operations?

KIYONE
No.  It came as quite a pleasant surprise.

RYOKO
You believe that?  It was simply chance that you got that assignment?

KIYONE
Why do you want to know?

RYOKO
I have never tried to get to know you Kiyone.  The first time we met was
under difficult circumstances.  You did just save all of our lives out
there.

KIYONE
I know that the Grand Marshall had a hand in my promotion.

RYOKO
Does it bother you?

KIYONE
I could have earned it on my own.

RYOKO
Who said you didn't?

KIYONE
Do you know that Mihoshi is the Grand Marshall's granddaughter?

RYOKO
Yes, and what would have happened to you if Mihoshi wanted to keep you
as her partner on Earth.

KIYONE
Are you saying that Mihoshi had nothing to do with my promotion?

RYOKO
No.  I am saying that Mihoshi let you go.

KIYONE
I didn't think of that.  Why would Mihoshi let me go?

RYOKO
Isn't it obvious?  She loves you.  I heard you talking to Washu and
Tenchi about Mihoshi.

Kiyone's face falls.

KIYONE
You did?

RYOKO
We need to set down over there by that small gray boulder.

KIYONE
Yagami, left ten degrees and forward two hundred feet.

YAGAMI
Yes Lieutenant.

RYOKO
Trust in your own abilities Kiyone.  But remember you have a close friend
in Mihoshi.

Ryoko teleports off the ship and appears on the view screen.

The ground around her boils and a red sphere pops out of the dirt.

The sphere changes to a black egg as it settles in Ryoko's hands.

Ryoko disappears from the view screen and reappears on the bridge.

RYOKO
Let's go join the others.

Kiyone and Ryoko leave the bridge.

INT. Family room - DAY

Everyone is gathered around the table waiting.

Sasami is holding a big cake with white frosting and small frosting 
carrots decorating the top.

Kiyone and Ryoko walk in.

RYOKO
Look Tenchi our baby has arrived.

Tenchi falls over laughing while the rest join in.

Kiyone, Kazuhiko, and Ryoe stare in disbelief.

RYOKO
I'm sorry.  It's a very old joke.

SASAMI
I forgot about it being an egg.  What will I do with this carrot cake?

TENCHI
What did you use to make it?

SASAMI
I followed the recipe in one of my Earth cookbooks.  There is very little
carrot in it.

TENCHI
Oh that kind of carrot cake.  Ryoko you are the mom so come over here and
cut the cake.

Ryoko sets the egg on the table and cuts the cake.

She hands out the cake to everyone.

TENCHI
This is delicious Sasami.  I was afraid it was frosting covered carrots.

SASAMI
That's okay.  That's what I thought it would be until I read the recipe.

KIYONE
We can leave for Jurai anytime you want Tenchi.

Mihoshi touches Washu with a sad look on her face.

Washu pulls out a small black metal box.

WASHU
All I could save was Yukinojo's heart.

Mihoshi takes the box reverently and begins to cry.

Kiyone walks over to Mihoshi and lays her hand on Mihoshi's shoulder.

KIYONE
You could put it in another police ship from Headquarters.

MIHOSHI
He wouldn't be the same.

WASHU
True, but you could think of him as Yukinojo's son.

Mihoshi's face brightens.

MIHOSHI
Like Ryo-Ohki.  This is Yukinojo's egg.

Kiyone gives Mihoshi a hug.

KIYONE
Yes, it's Yukinojo's egg.

TENCHI
Are you ready to go to Jurai Ayeka?

AYEKA
Yes Lord Tenchi.

Tenchi looks over at Ryoko.

RYOKO
Yes Tenchi.

TENCHI
Okay Kiyone.  It is time for us to get going.

Kiyone releases Mihoshi and stands.

KIYONE
Want to join me on the bridge Mihoshi.  It would be like old times.

Kiyone sets Yukinojo's egg next to Ryo-Ohki and stands.

Mihoshi takes her hand and they leave the room.

TENCHI
Now we must make plans to face Azusa.

Everyone nods their head.

INT. Dining room - DAY (Saturday, 26 July 1997)

Everyone finishes eating dinner.

RYOKO
You know what?

AYEKA
What?

RYOKO
I feel like pickles and ice cream.

Kazuhiko leaps to his feet.

KAZUHIKO
You're pregnant!?

Sasami rushes out of the room.

She returns with carrot cake and sets it down on the table.

Ryoko pulls out the egg and holds it up.

The shell begins to crack and then shatters.

RYO-OHKI
Meow!

Ryo-Ohki lands in Ryoko's arms.

Kazuhiko sits back down.

KAZUHIKO
Oh.

Ryoko nuzzles Ryo-Ohki's cheek.

RYOKO (Expressed as thought)
Go to Sasami now Ryo-Ohki.

Ryo-Ohki jumps out of Ryoko's arms and lands in Sasami's.

SASAMI
You remember me!

RYO-OHKI
Meow!

Sasami hugs Ryo-Ohki close.

She cuts a piece of cake.

SASAMI
Here Ryo-Ohki I made this for you.

Ryoko sniffs the piece and takes a bite.

RYO-OHKI
Meow, Meow!

Ryo-Ohki quickly eats the piece Sasami gave her and jumps out of her arms.

She lands on the cake sending frosting everywhere.

Sasami goes to the kitchen while Ryo-Ohki digs into the cake.

Everyone is laughing at Ryo-Ohki while they clean frosting off themselves.

Sasami returns with another cake.

SASAMI
This one is for us.

Sasami hands out slices of cake.

The planet Jurai is on the view screen.

KIYONE
Welcome home Ayeka.

AYEKA
Will home welcome me?

YAGAMI
Incoming message Lieutenant Kiyone.

KIYONE
Put it on please.

A young man in a Galaxy Police uniform fills the screen.

KURUMI
Good day Captain Kiyone.  I am Detective Kurumi.

KIYONE
That's Lieutenant.

KURUMI
No ma'am.  I have your orders right here.  You have been promoted to
Commander, Jurai Affairs Section, Special Operations Division.

AYEKA
Congratulations Kiyone.

KURUMI
I am currently on board Detective First Class Mihoshi's new ship.  I would
request that she take command of this ship as soon as possible.  I am to
return with you, Captain, to Galaxy Police Headquarters directly.

KIYONE
Let me get everyone ready.  It will be about thirty minutes.

KURUMI
Yes ma'am, I await your orders.

The planet Jurai is again on the view screen.

KIYONE
I don't understand.

AYEKA
What's wrong Kiyone?

KIYONE
I haven't done anything to deserve this promotion.  Unless...  Mihoshi!

Kiyone leaves the bridge and Ayeka follows.

INT. Family room - DAY

Ryoko, Ryoe, and Mihoshi sit eating snacks while watching TV.

Kiyone and Ayeka enter the room.

KIYONE
Mihoshi have you sent any reports to Galaxy Police Headquarters?

Mihoshi tries to talk with a mouth full of food.

MIHOSHI
I have been sending reports through Yagami everyday.

KIYONE
Everyday!

Mihoshi nods her head.

KIYONE
Mihoshi!

Mihoshi swallows.

MIHOSHI
I'm sorry.
 
Kiyone storms out of the room.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Jurai is on the view screen.

Kiyone stomps in and sits down.

KIYONE
Yagami do you have all outgoing messages stored?

YAGAMI
Yes Captain.

Kiyone rolls her eyes.

KIYONE
Play last message sent by Mihoshi.

YAGAMI
Mihoshi has sent no messages.

KIYONE
Are you sure?

YAGAMI
Yes Captain.

KIYONE
Mihoshi!

Kiyone storms off the bridge.

INT. Family room - DAY

Ayeka has joined the other girl in having a snack and watching TV

Grandfather, Tenchi, and Kazuhiko sit in the back of the room.

Kiyone storms in.

TENCHI
Congratulations on your promotion.  I understand that Mihoshi's new...

KIYONE (overlapping)
Later Tenchi.  Yagami doesn't remember you sending any messages.

MIHOSHI
Of course not.  Yagami can't remember my messages.

KIYONE
Because you never sent any!

MIHOSHI
Did you ever see me send a message when we were together on Earth?

KIYONE
Yes, after I would remind you.

MIHOSHI
Ask Yagami.

Kiyone taps on her wristband.

YAGAMI (O. C.)
Yes Captain.

KIYONE
Yagami do you recall when Mihoshi and I were together on Earth?

YAGAMI (O. C.)
Yes Captain.

KIYONE
Replay the last message sent by Mihoshi during that time.

YAGAMI (O. C.)
Mihoshi sent no messages during that time.

KIYONE
Replay last message sent by me during that time.

YAGAMI (O. C.)
Message follows.  Orders acknowledged.  I am departing SOL system for
Galaxy Police Headquarters and will arrive in thirty-two days.  End of
Message.

Kiyone taps again on her wristband.

KIYONE
I don't understand.

WASHU (O. C.)
I do.
 
Kiyone turns to face Washu by her stairwell door.

KIYONE
Pardon?

WASHU
Your partner could tell you.

Kiyone turns to face Mihoshi.

KIYONE
Tell me what.

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu I don't know what you mean.

WASHU
I know how they classify all of your message traffic Mihoshi.

KIYONE
Classify?  What kind of classification?  I have the highest clearance
in the Galaxy Police.

Mihoshi looks down at her hands.

MIHOSHI
All of my messages are classified Cosmic Top Secret.

KIYONE
I have never heard of Cosmic Top Secret.

WASHU
There is only one thing in the universe that carries that classification.
Mihoshi's messages.

MIHOSHI
All systems delete my messages as they send them.  They also delete any
trace that a message was ever sent.

KIYONE
Every message you send?  No matter how minor?
 
Mihoshi nods her head.

WASHU
Mihoshi never sends a minor message.  Did you know that after two years
of trying I still haven't accessed one of Mihoshi's complete messages?
I have gotten a couple of summaries from the Jurai Security Council.

AYEKA
Jurai Security Council?

WASHU
Oops, I didn't mean to say that.

TENCHI
That must be quite the challenge to you?

Washu nods her head.

WASHU
It keeps me going.

KIYONE
What are in your messages Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Everything.  What I ate.  When I wash my hair.  What people did or say.
Who I met.  Everything.

Ayeka turns red.

AYEKA
Do you ever leave anything out?

Mihoshi shakes her head.

RYOKO
That's why Washu couldn't tell us the Lady's name.

KIYONE
How long have you known this?

MIHOSHI
It's always been that way.  Even before I joined the Galaxy Police.

Everyone stands silent.

WASHU
I am ready to move the house to the Yukinojo, Tenchi.

KIYONE
I have to report directly to Headquarters.

TENCHI
Our wedding.

KIYONE
I hope to be back in time.  If not, your wedding present is the Karaoke
machine.

RYOKO
All right!  Thanks Kiyone.

Kiyone smiles.

KIYONE
Think of me when you use it.
 
Mihoshi walks over to Kiyone and hugs her.

MIHOSHI
I'm so sorry Kiyone.  I will miss you partner.  Please visit me sometimes.

KIYONE
I will try Mihoshi.
 
The others gather around Kiyone to say good-bye.

KIYONE
Where's Sasami?
 
On cue Sasami walks in with a large cake.

Written on the cake is "Congratulations Captain Kiyone, We Love You".

Sasami sets the cake down and gives Kiyone a hug.

KIYONE
I'm sorry for all the things I said or did to hurt anyone of you.  It is
too easy to forget who your real friends are, and fail to appreciate them.

TENCHI
Please cut the cake Kiyone.

Kiyone cuts the cake and Sasami helps to pass out the pieces.

Everyone finishes with the cake.

KIYONE
I have to be going now.  Thank you Sasami, thank you everyone.

TENCHI
Take care Kiyone.  Thank you for saving my wives and my friends.

Kiyone nods her head and leaves the house.

TENCHI
It is time to give Yukinojo back his heart.

Everyone leaves the room.

INT. Yagami's bridge - DAY

Kiyone sits in her chair.

Kurumi is on the view screen.

KURUMI
Everyone is on board the Yukinojo.  Detective First Class Mihoshi has
taken command.  Permission to come aboard the Yagami.

KIYONE
Very good, you may transport over directly.

KURUMI
Yes ma'am.

Mihoshi replaces Kurumi on the view screen.

KIYONE
When I get back we need to have a long talk.

MIHOSHI
I don't know what I can tell you.

KIYONE
That you are my friend will be enough.
 
Mihoshi smiles.

KIYONE
Did you ask for them to promote me Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
No.  I only sent in your performance report.

KIYONE
You are not authorized to rate me.

MIHOSHI
Kiyone, I am authorized to rate anyone.  I can even rate my grandfather.

KIYONE
Who reads your reports?

MIHOSHI
I don't know.

KIYONE
You don't know?

MIHOSHI
I don't have a Cosmic Top Secret clearance.  Strange isn't it?

Kurumi enters the bridge.

KIYONE
Good bye Detective First Class Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
Good bye Captain Kiyone.
 
The planet Jurai appears on the view screen.

KIYONE
Please have a seat Detective Kurumi.

KURUMI
Thank you ma'am.  Have you known Detective First Class Mihoshi a long
time?

KIYONE
Yes.

KURUMI
I have followed your career Captain.  You have really gone far once you
left her behind.

KIYONE
If I ever hear you or anyone else speak ill of Detective First Class
Mihoshi they will find themselves checking parking meters in some
asteroid belt.

KURUMI
Yes ma'am!  Forgive me please!

KIYONE
Yagami, please set course for the Galaxy Police Headquarters.  Maximum
speed.

YAGAMI
Yes Captain.

INT. Yukinojo's bridge - DAY

Mihoshi sits in her chair.

Mihoshi is crying.

The Yagami is on the view screen.

It fires its engines and moves away leaving Jurai on the view screen.

Tenchi enters the bridge and moves up behind her.

He places his hands on her shoulders.

TENCHI
Thank you Mihoshi.
 
Mihoshi sniffs and she cross her arms over her chest to rest her hands
on Tenchi's hands.

TENCHI
Thank you for being true to yourself.

MIHOSHI
Are you ready to go down there?

TENCHI
Yes.

Everyone is present except Mihoshi.

All are dressed in their finest clothes.

Mihoshi enters the room.

MIHOSHI
I have received a message for Ayeka or Sasami.  It has a class 5M
encryption code.

SASAMI
It's a message from mother.

AYEKA
We'd better go see what she wants.
 
Ayeka and Sasami head for the door.  At the door Ayeka stops and turns
around.

AYEKA
This will involve you too Tenchi.

TENCHI
A message from Misaki, I don't know.

AYEKA
And you may as well come too, Ryoko.
 
Ryoko takes Tenchi's arm and they follow Ayeka and Sasami out of the
house.

Washu moves next to Grandfather.

WASHU
Are you going down like that?

GRANDFATHER
This is who I am now.

Washu nods her head.

WASHU
I understand, although I wonder about one thing.

GRANDFATHER
What's that?

WASHU
Will changing our outsides ever change our hearts?

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, and Sasami enter the room.

TENCHI
Let's go Mihoshi.
 
Mihoshi touches her wristband and the group disappears.

INT. Waiting area - DAY

Azaka and Kamidake stand by the receiving pad.

The group appears.

SASAMI
Hello Azaka.  Hello Kamidake.

AZAKA
Hello Princess.

KAMIDAKE
Hello Princess Ayeka.

AYEKA
What now?

AZAKA
Please follow us.

KAMIDAKE
To the Jurai throne room.
 
The group, with Ayeka in the lead, follows Azaka and Kamidake.

INT. Jurai Royal Throne room - DAY

The room is crowded.

Azusa stands between Funaho and Misaki below the throne.

As Azaka and Kamidake enter they step to either side of the door.

AZAKA and KAMIDAKE
Good luck Princess.

Ayeka leads the group to within twenty feet of the Emperor.

Azusa lifts his crown from his head.

He drops to his knees and bows his head nearly to the ground while
holding the crown out in front of him.

Ayeka steps forward and takes the crown.

She holds it high over her head.

Azusa drops his arms to the side and looks at Ayeka.

AYEKA
I am sorry father.

Ayeka turns her back on Azusa.

A murmur goes through the audience.

She takes a couple of steps forward and drops to her knees.

Ayeka bows her head nearly to the ground while holding the crown out in
front of her.

AZUSA
What are you doing?

AYEKA
The only choice you left for me.

Misaki begins crying.

The murmur gets louder in the audience.

Tenchi gently pushes Sasami forward.

Sasami slowly walks forward to Ayeka.

She takes the crown and holds it high over her head.

She walks to Azusa and stands in front of him.

SASAMI
I warned you that I would hate you forever.

Azusa bows his head.

SASAMI
I am still young though and I do not really understand what forever means.

Sasami set the crown on Azusa's head.

SASAMI
I have hated you long enough.

Azusa hugs Sasami from his knees.

Funaho and Misaki join the two.

A cheer goes through the audience.

Ayeka stands and turns around.

Azusa holds out a hand to her.

AYEKA
Who will you choose for my husband now?

AZUSA
I will choose no one Ayeka.  Choose for yourself.

TENCHI
That's our cue.

Tenchi takes Ryoko's hand and starts forward.

Ryoko stops him.

RYOKO
You don't need me now.  He has given in to her.

TENCHI
I need you now more than ever.

Tears seep from Ryoko's eyes.

Tenchi and Ryoko approach Ayeka.

AYEKA
Emperor may I introduce my future husband.  This is Tenchi Masaki, son
of Achika Masaki, grandson of Yoshou, and your great grandson.

Applause and cheers through the audience.

AYEKA
And may I introduce his first wife Ryoko Masaki.

The hall goes silent.

AYEKA
It is said that a girl often chooses a husband that most reminds her
of her father.
 
Funaho discreetly kicks Azusa.

AZUSA
I welcome you Tenchi Masaki and Ryoko Masaki to the Royal Family of Jurai.
May both of you and Princess Ayeka find happiness.

TENCHI
We have found love Emperor.

Azusa speaks to the audience.

AZUSA
Lord Tenchi and Lady Ryoko, Prince and Princess of Jurai.

The audience cheers.

Funaho leans close to Azusa's ear.

FUNAHO
I think it is time for someplace a little more private.

AZUSA
The audience is at an end.

As the crowd disperses the group makes its way to a room behind the
throne.

INT. Reception room - DAY

The group enters the room.

Azusa walks over to a window and looks out.

Misaki and Funaho stop in the middle of the room.

Sasami runs up to Misaki.

SASAMI
Mommy I am so happy to see you.

Misaki hugs Sasami.

MISAKI
My little Sasami.

Ayeka runs up to Misaki.

AYEKA
Mommy this is the day I have always dreamed of.

Misaki hugs Ayeka.

MISAKI
My little Ayeka.

Ryoko runs up to Misaki.

RYOKO
Mommy I am so happy.

Misaki hugs Ryoko.

MISAKI
My little Ryoko.
 
Tenchi walks up to Misaki.

TENCHI
May I call you mommy?

Misaki hugs Tenchi.

MISAKI
That would please me greatly Tenchi.

Tenchi looks over Misaki's shoulder at Funaho.

TENCHI
Thank you great grandmother.

Funaho reaches out and touches Tenchi's cheek.

FUNAHO
Little Washu have you been well?

WASHU
Yes little Funaho.  I have been well entertained by the Masaki clan.

FUNAHO
And you Yoshou, how have you been doing?

GRANDFATHER
Well, mother, all things considered.

FUNAHO
Mihoshi it is always a pleasure to see you.  Your last report was very
informative.

MIHOSHI
Thank you very much.  I didn't know you got my reports.

FUNAHO
I only get the summery.

WASHU
You must still be on the Jurai Security Council.

Funaho nods her head.

FUNAHO
Tenchi please introduce your friends.

Tenchi disengages himself from Misaki.

TENCHI
Please forgive me.  This is Kazuhiko.  He has been my friend since
I started school.

KAZUHIKO
Greeting your Majesty.

FUNAHO
Just Funaho please.  I am happy to meet you.  I understand you are
a warrior of your people.

KAZUHIKO
I think that term is too generous.  I am a simple fighter for the cause.

TENCHI
This is Ryoe.  She is a good friend of Ayeka and Ryoko.

FUNAHO
I am sorry for your loss.  I hope that Little Washu's efforts restore
Daijiro to you.

RYOE
Thank you for your concern Lady Funaho.

FUNAHO
When will I be able to meet Daijiro?

RYOE
In seven and a half months.

FUNAHO
I look forward to that.  Where is Kiyone, Tenchi?

TENCHI
She was recalled to Headquarters.  She received her promotion to Captain.

MISAKI
If she only does a tenth of the things Mihoshi says, that promotion was
long overdue.
 
Mihoshi blushes.

Tenchi walks over to Azusa and looks out the window.

TENCHI
Shihou is dead.

AZUSA
I thought as much when you arrived.  Did Mihoshi help you kill him?

TENCHI
Mihoshi helped, but not against Shihou.  She helped to keep your
daughters alive.

AZUSA
I must thank her.

TENCHI
Then do so, she is right here.

Azusa turns and looks at Mihoshi.

AZUSA
Thank you Mihoshi for saving my daughters.  If it is within my power
you may have it.

MIHOSHI
I was only doing my job.  That is reward enough for me.

Azusa nods his head and turns back to look out the window.

TENCHI
Ryoko helped me to kill Shihou.  Together we generated ten of the
Light Hawk Wings.

Azusa turns to look at Tenchi.

TENCHI
I brought back Shihou's body.

AZUSA
Why?

TENCHI
No matter what he did he is still your son.  I thought it would be better
for him to be buried on Jurai instead of some nameless rock.

AZUSA
This was all my fault.

TENCHI
This started so very long ago.  Before I was born.  Before Ayeka was
born.

AZUSA
Even then it was still my fault.

Tenchi turns to look at Azusa.

TENCHI
True.

AZUSA
If I had known.  If I could see beyond myself.

TENCHI
Think about this.  If you had done something about it back then, where
would your daughter be today?

AZUSA
I am sorry Tenchi.

TENCHI
I forgive you.  Sasami has forgiven you.  Some day Ayeka may forgive you.

AZUSA
All of you are welcome to stay here at the palace.

TENCHI
Thank you but no.  We will be staying on the Yukinojo.

AZUSA
As you wish.  When do you plan on the wedding?

TENCHI
I will let you know after Ayeka and I have discussed it.

AYEKA
Startika.

Tenchi and Azusa look at Ayeka.

AYEKA
I want to be married on Startika Day.

Tenchi and Azusa nod their head.

Grandfather joins the two men.

TENCHI
You were right Grandfather.  Jurai is a beautiful planet.

Tenchi bows slightly to the Emperor.

TENCHI
Emperor.

Tenchi joins the others, and they move to the far side of the room.

AZUSA
You have done well my son.

GRANDFATHER
I was once just like you.  Blinded by my own arrogance.

AZUSA
And now you can see?

GRANDFATHER
Dimly.  A woman offered to be my eyes.  I am glad I accepted her offer.
After time she taught me to see.  There are two ladies over there that
would be your eyes if you would let them.

AZUSA
For a brief moment today I found hope.  I thought I was rid of this crown.

GRANDFATHER
Some day Sasami will let you give it to her.  She will be Jurai's finest
ruler in over ten thousand years.

AZUSA
Tenchi would have been greater.

GRANDFATHER
No.  Tenchi will be Sasami's guardian and friend.  It is a much more
important job then wearing a crown.

AZUSA
Then I will wait.  Only now I will let Funaho and Misaki hold my hand.

GRANDFATHER
I am proud of you father, and I love you.

AZUSA
Thank you son.  I have longed to hear those words.

SASAMI
Thank you Mihoshi.

WASHU
I am going to check thing out in the lab.

TENCHI
Little Washu, Kazuhiko and myself will go with you to get our clothes
for the wedding.

WASHU
Okay.

RYOKO
Ryoe could you go with Washu to copy your brides maid outfit for me.
If I am going to be a bride's maid I should look the part.

RYOE
Is that okay with you Little Washu.

WASHU
Of course.

AYEKA
I am going to rest a bit Tenchi.

TENCHI
Okay Ayeka, I will see you later.

Everyone but Ryoko leaves the room.

Ryoko smiles and rubs her hands together.

She then disappears.

INT. Ayeka's room - DAY

Ayeka kneels next to an open chest with a smile on her face.

Her hand is stirring something inside.

The door opens suddenly and Ryoko steps in with a package.

Ayeka slams the chest shut.

AYEKA
Don't you ever knock!

Ryoko sniffs the air.

RYOKO
Get used to it.  We will be sharing the same bed.  So what are you hiding
Princess.

AYEKA
Nothing.  Nothing at all.

RYOKO
Let me see!  Let me see!

Ryoko shoves Ayeka to the side and opens the chest.

A bowl of cherry blossoms sit inside the chest.

RYOKO
Although they are only around for a short time.  Whenever I think of
Earth I think of cherry blossoms.

AYEKA
Yes they smell so wonderful.

RYOKO
Is there anything like this on Jurai?

AYEKA
No, nothing.

RYOKO
Then they will make your wedding even more memorable.

AYEKA
You don't mind if I copy you?

RYOKO
No Ayeka, I want your wedding to be perfect.

AYEKA
Thank you Ryoko, I am sorry I yelled.

RYOKO
What will you be wearing at the wedding?

AYEKA
Traditional marriage robes.

RYOKO
Are they special like maybe Misaki's?

AYEKA
Oh no, nothing like that.  I don't think we could find those after all
these years.

Ryoko sits down.

RYOKO
I wouldn't bet on that.

AYEKA
Do you think I should ask her?

Ryoko shakes her head and opens the package.

Ayeka sees the powder blue kimono.

AYEKA
That's your wedding dress from Achika.
 
Ryoko nods her head.

AYEKA
Is it for me?
 
Ryoko nods her head again.

Ayeka clutches onto Ryoko tightly.

AYEKA
You are so kind to me.

Ryoko strokes Ayeka's hair.

RYOKO
Sometimes the older sister likes to indulge the younger sister.

AYEKA
Thank you Ryoko.

Ryoko stands up and walks to the door.

She stops and turns around.

RYOKO
Ayeka?

AYEKA
Yes.

RYOKO
It's okay if we fight now and then, and yell at each other every so often.

AYEKA
That's a relief.  I sometimes have a short fuse.

Ryoko busts out laughing and continues to laugh all the way out the door.

INT. Ayeka's room - DAY

Ayeka stands before a mirror modeling her wedding gown.

Someone knocks on the door.

AYEKA
Who is it?

GRANDFATHER (O. C.)
It's your brother.

AYEKA
Come in.
 
Grandfather enters the room and stops when he sees Ayeka.

GRANDFATHER
You are beautiful.

AYEKA
Thank you brother.

GRANDFATHER
No that word was not adequate to describe you.

AYEKA
It has been a long time since you last complemented me Yoshou.

GRANDFATHER
I am sorry for all the pain and grief I caused you.

Ayeka waves her hand to show it doesn't matter.

GRANDFATHER
I never meant to break your heart.

AYEKA
You may have broken my heart, but it was empty.  Your grandson has both
mended and filled my heart.

Grandfather takes Ayeka's hand and places a ring in it.

Ayeka looks at the ring.

It is interwoven leaves of gold.  The leaves are shaped like the leaves
on the Jurai Life Tree.

AYEKA
It's beautiful.

GRANDFATHER
After I took my future wife, Etsuki, to see my Life Tree she went to
a local craftsman to have that made.  She decided then to marry me, and
I saw no objection to marriage.

AYEKA
This must mean a lot to you.  I can't take it.

GRANDFATHER
It is only a ring.  It can not replace my wife or my daughter.  Those
memories will be with me forever.  That ring belongs to Tenchi now.

AYEKA
Thank you brother.  I am honored by your gift.

GRANDFATHER
If I could have done things differently.

AYEKA
Do not disturb the past brother.  If you did I would lose the future
I hold so dear.

Grandfather kisses Ayeka and leaves the room.

Ayeka stares at the ring in her hand.

INT. Grandfather's study - DAY (Saturday, 9 August 1997, 10th Day, 6th
Month)

Grandfather kneels before the shrine meditating.

Someone knocks on the door.

GRANDFATHER
Who is it?

TENCHI (O. C.)
It's time for breakfast Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Come in Tenchi.

The door opens and Tenchi enters.

GRANDFATHER
Join me Tenchi.
 
Tenchi kneels next to Grandfather and places his hands together.

TENCHI
What do you wish Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Do you now accept your Jurai blood?

TENCHI
I accept myself for who I am.  I accept all that has gone into me.
My father was from Earth.  My grandmother was from Earth, and even
my great grandmother was from Earth.  That leaves little Jurai blood
left in me.

GRANDFATHER
You do not understand.  Your blood is one hundred percent Jurai.
The Jurai colonized the galaxy.

TENCHI
What about the fossil record?

GRANDFATHER
What is easier to accept?  Your mother was a fossil or your mother came
from Mars.

Tenchi chuckles.

TENCHI
I see your point Grandfather.  I may be Jurai but I still wish to return
to Earth.

GRANDFATHER
What of Ryoko and Ayeka?

TENCHI
Those two would follow me to heaven or hell.

GRANDFATHER
I have something for you to give to my sister.

Grandfather holds out a delicate golden ring of intertwining leaves.

TENCHI
It's beautiful Grandfather.
 
Grandfather gives the ring to Tenchi.

TENCHI
This is the ring you gave to grandmother.

GRANDFATHER
Yes it is. 

TENCHI
You've had this ring for a long time.
 
Grandfather nods his head.

TENCHI
Why didn't you give this to dad?

GRANDFATHER
My daughter lost her mother when she was young, just like you, and she
knew that ring too well.  I did not want to remind her of the pain and
loss on her wedding day.

TENCHI
There's more to this ring isn't there Grandfather.

Grandfather closes his eyes and lowers his head.

TENCHI
You first got this ring for Ayeka.

Grandfather nods his head.

TENCHI
So Ayeka's ring has gone full circle.  I am honored to be the one to
place this ring on Ayeka's hand.

Tears leak from Grandfather's eyes.

TENCHI
I will have Sasami save you something for when you are ready to come down.
I love you Grandfather.
 
Tenchi stands and leaves the room.

INT. Washu's second lab - DAY (Sunday, 17 August 1997; 18th Day, 6th Month)

Ryoe stands by Daijiro's cylinder with her hand resting against it.

Daijiro is the size of a one month old baby.

A rod through the side of the tank is attached to his navel.

He wears a soft cap with wire coming out the top and into a machine.

Washu enters the lab.

WASHU
Good morning Ryoe.
 
Washu checks on the machine.

RYOE
I wish Daijiro could go to the wedding.

WASHU
If you asked, Tenchi and Ayeka would delay the wedding.

RYOE
They already offered to do so.  I declined the offer.

WASHU
Why?

RYOE
It would have been for my own selfish reasons.  I knew that if I did that
it would hurt Daijiro.

WASHU
Love is such a strict master.

RYOE
You must have had many loves throughout your life.

WASHU
How many loves have you had?

RYOE
Just this one.

WASHU
Then we have something in common.

RYOE
Oh my, I am so sorry Little Washu.  I wasn't thinking.  Please forgive me.
Washu walks over and places her hand on the cylinder.

WASHU
Losing your loved one is a hard lesson to learn.  They say time heals
all wounds, but I haven't figured out how long yet.  If this didn't work
you would be learning that lesson now.

RYOE
I wasn't doing to well with it when I woke up.  Thank you for saving me
from that fate.

WASHU
I only wished I could have done more.

INT. Tenchi's room - Night (Friday, 29 August 1997; First Day Summer

The crowd takes notice, as they smell the air.

AZUSA
That fragrance reminds me of something.

SASAMI
It is one of the many beautiful things from Earth.

Azusa notices Ayeka and her bride's maids.

AZUSA
That is a very plain outfit...
 
Sasami punches Azusa in the ribs.

Azusa gives her a questioning look.

SASAMI
The wisest thing I ever heard a man say was nothing.

Ayeka and her bride's maids walk up to Azusa.

AZUSA
You look like a goddess today.

Sasami smiles and starts down the aisle tossing cherry blossoms.

Azusa escorts Ayeka to the front and hands her to Tenchi.

The bride's maids take up their spot.

Sasami sits between Misaki and Funaho.

Azusa sits between Sasami and Funaho.

SASAMI
I am now the Crown Princess of Jurai.

Azusa, Funaho, and Misaki look at her.

SASAMI
If you even think to choose my husband you will find how quickly I become
Empress.
 
Misaki and Funaho smile as all four turn their attention to the wedding.

Grandfather conducts the ceremony.

Kazuhiko and Ryoko each bear the rings for exchange.

GRANDFATHER
I now pronounce you Man and Wife.

Tenchi gives Ayeka a long passionate kiss.

They move back down the aisle in a shower of confetti.

Everyone follows them out of the temple.

It is growing late Tenchi.

I hope you are not sleepy.

TENCHI
Emperor Azusa, it has come time for my wife and me to retire for the
evening.

AZUSA
I wish you both a good night.

AYEKA
Father, I forgive you, and I love you.
 
Ayeka kisses Azusa, Misaki, and Funaho.

Azusa offers his hand to Tenchi, and Tenchi takes it.

Tenchi then kisses Funaho and Misaki.

Tenchi glances over to Mihoshi and nods his head.

Mihoshi touches her wristband, and Tenchi and Ayeka disappear.

Grandfather watches the happy couple go, and then he slips out of the
ballroom quietly.

AZAKA
Hello there, are you Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
Yes, and you are?

AZAKA
Azaka.

KAMIDAKE
Kamidake.

KAZUHIKO
Yes, Ayeka has spoken fondly of you both many times.

KAMIDAKE
The Princess is too kind.

AZAKA
Do you have any plans for this evening?

KAZUHIKO
No, I am the lone wolf of the group.

AZAKA
I heard you are a warrior.

KAMIDAKE
So are we.

AZAKA
We will call you Lone Wolf.

KAMIDAKE
Would you care to join our pack for tonight?

KAZUHIKO
Yes I would enjoy that.

The three leave the ballroom.

Ryoko is quite drunk.

I love you Ayeka.

He unties her first bow.

Ayeka looks nervous.

TENCHI
It will be all right.  Trust me.

AYEKA
I have dreamed of this moment, but now I am afraid.

TENCHI
First rule, no secrets between us.  I have had a good teacher.

Ayeka blushes.

AYEKA
You did not learn together?

TENCHI
She was Kagato's slave for five thousand years.

AYEKA
Oh, that is so sad.

TENCHI
She said she would do it again to be with me.

Ayeka's face shows a big smile.

Ayeka
That is very romantic.

Tenchi
Ryoko wanted you to enjoy your first time even more than I did.

Ayeka
No secrets?

Tenchi
No secrets.

Ayeka pulls out some red silk cord from her kimono, and holds it out
to Tenchi.

Tenchi takes the cord and drops it on the floor.

Tenchi
Not for our first time, but maybe later.
 
Ayeka nods her head.

Tenchi continues to undress her.

INT. Washu's second lab - NIGHT

Ryoe sits in a chair next to the cylinder.  She is leaning up against

have been there.  It all started...

EXT. A tree in one of Jurai's parks - NIGHT

Kazuhiko, Azaka, and Kamidake sit in a tree passing a bottle back and

She hits one last key.

WASHU
Save.

She leans back on her pillow and places her hands behind her head.

WASHU
Well my little guinea pig.  Where will you lead us next?

INT. Life Tree temple - NIGHT

Grandfather stands in front of Tsunami.  He has his hand against her
trunk.

Funaho slips up behind him.

FUNAHO
I recognized Ayeka's ring.

GRANDFATHER
You should, you help me pick it out.

FUNAHO
Will you keep up your disguise even here?

GRANDFATHER
This is who I am now.

FUNAHO
How much longer do you think your Life Tree will survive?

GRANDFATHER
You do not think they will return to Earth?

FUNAHO
I think they are on a mission.  I don't know where it will lead.

GRANDFATHER
To answer your question.  I believe she will live forever.

FUNAHO
Washu.

Grandfather nods his head.

FUNAHO
She promised me that...

GRANDFATHER (overlapping)
She told the truth.  You must remember her exact words.

FUNAHO
Of course.  She must love you Yoshou.

GRANDFATHER
Deeply.  She has bared her soul to me.

FUNAHO
Will you do the same?

GRANDFATHER
I am afraid that her husband and I are too much alike.

FUNAHO
That acknowledgement is the difference that separates you.

GRANDFATHER
Forgive me mother.  I have let the family down.

FUNAHO
I forgive you for whatever wrong you imagine.  Today the family is
stronger than ever.

GRANDFATHER
Sasami will make a fine Empress one day, and Tenchi will be at her
side to guard her.

FUNAHO
Be at peace my son.  I am with you wherever you go.
 
Funaho leaves Grandfather standing alone.

Tsunami lights up the temple.

INT. Sasami's room - NIGHT

Sasami sits on her bed holding Ryo-Ohki.

SASAMI
Well the room is all mine now.

RYO-OHKI
Meow?

SASAMI
I am feeling very lonely now.

Ryo-Ohki changes into her girl form.

She strokes Sasami's hair.

RYO-OHKI
Miya.  Miya?  Miya.

Sasami hugs Ryo-Ohki.

SASAMI
You can still change!

RYO-OHKI
Miya!

SASAMI
Thank you Ryo-Ohki.  I am not as lonely as I thought.

INT. Family room - NIGHT

Mihoshi and Ryoko sit at the table.  A late night soap opera is on the TV.

Ryoko is drinking sake from the bottle.

Ryoko shakes the empty bottle.

Ryoko is obviously drunk.

RYOKO
Where's some more sake.  I want more sake.

MIHOSHI
Haven't you had enough Ryoko?
 
Ryoko shakes her body trying to shake her head.

MIHOSHI
Let me help you to bed.

RYOKO
Can't go to bed.

MIHOSHI
Why can't you...

Mihoshi reddens.

Ryoko looks forlornly at the empty bottle.

MIHOSHI
Didn't Ayeka visit you on your wedding night?

RYOKO
How do you know about that?

Mihoshi smiles.

RYOKO
I am more secure in my love with Tenchi than she is.

MIHOSHI
Really?

Ryoko nods her body trying to nod her head.

Mihoshi stands up.

MIHOSHI
It is time for you to go to bed.

RYOKO
I will go to bed after I pass out.

Mihoshi gathers up Ryoko across her shoulders.

RYOKO
Where are you taking me?  I'm not done drinking yet.

MIHOSHI
Yes you are.  You can feel sorry for yourself with a clear head tomorrow.

Mihoshi leaves the room carrying Ryoko.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT

Tenchi and Ayeka are in bed holding each other under the sheets.

AYEKA
That was indescribable.  Such pleasure.  Such pain.  All rushing in
at once.

TENCHI
I didn't mean to hurt you.

AYEKA
It wasn't hurting.  It was sensations.

Tenchi kisses and caresses her face.

TENCHI
You are so beautiful.

AYEKA
Do you think Ryoko will show up tonight?

TENCHI
No, Ryoko will do everything in her power to leave us alone tonight.

Ayeka begins to cry.

AYEKA
I ruined your wedding night with her.  I was so lonely and afraid.

Tenchi kisses her eyes.

TENCHI
Don't cry Ayeka.  We invited you in that night.  Not a night followed
that Ryoko and I didn't want you there.

AYEKA
Are you just saying that?

TENCHI
No secrets remember.  When Ryoko was recovering she could see us together.
It made her happy.

AYEKA
I don't deserve you and Ryoko.

TENCHI
With Ryoko alone I am unbalanced.  I need you both Ayeka.

AYEKA
I am duty, she is fun.

TENCHI
I am duty; both of you are love.

Tenchi leans over the side of the bed and pulls up the red silk cord.

TENCHI
So my dear wife what am I to do with these?

Ayeka blushes.

AYEKA
It's not important.

TENCHI
I have read Father's magazines just like the rest of you.

Ayeka's blush deepens.

AYEKA
It's just that...  I have never...  I was raised to rule the universe.
Can you understand that?

TENCHI
Explain it to me.

AYEKA
I have always been in control of everything.  My emotions, the people
around me, and even the situation I found myself in.

Tenchi's face lights up.

TENCHI
I didn't know the level of trust you have put in me, my love.

AYEKA
Tenchi, I...

Tenchi kisses Ayeka.

TENCHI
That's okay.  You don't have to reveal all of your secrets to me at once.
Trust is a fragile thing that must be renewed daily.

AYEKA
I love you Tenchi.

TENCHI
I love you Ayeka, and I shall do all I can to maintain your trust in me.

He ties one cord to Ayeka's left wrist.

TENCHI
Have you ever released total control like this?

AYEKA
You are the first one I have found that I'm willing to give control too.

He ties the other end of the cord to the bedpost.

TENCHI
I will be gentle with you my love.  I never want to lose your trust.

AYEKA
Yes Tenchi, yes.

INT. Mihoshi's bedroom - NIGHT

The door opens and Mihoshi carries Ryoko inside.

She drops Ryoko on the bed.

RYOKO
Why am I here?

MIHOSHI
You needed a place to sleep.

Mihoshi changes into her pajamas.

She gets into bed next to Ryoko.

RYOKO
I don't think we should be here together.

MIHOSHI
Why do you say that?

Ryoko sounds and looks sober.

RYOKO
Do you love Tenchi?

Mihoshi nods her head.

MIHOSHI
Yes, I love him very much.

RYOKO
I can talk to Ayeka so you can be with him.

MIHOSHI
You're trying to embarrass me.

RYOKO
I'm just saying that if you love him Ayeka and I won't stand in your way.

MIHOSHI
Just because I love him doesn't mean I want to make love with him.

RYOKO
Well, ah, do you like boys Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Do I what?

Mihoshi covers her mouth and turns red.

MIHOSHI
Why do you ask?

RYOKO
You seem awfully friendly with Kiyone.

Mihoshi smiles.

MIHOSHI
Oh.  I understand now.  Do you love Grandfather?

RYOKO
Yes very much.

MIHOSHI
So why don't you make love with him?

RYOKO
I don't love him that way.

MIHOSHI
You have answered your own question.

Ryoko nods her head.

MIHOSHI
Sometimes Ryoko what you really need is a friend to be there with you.
You are my friend and I hope to be yours.

RYOKO
You will be my friend Mihoshi?

Mihoshi nods her head.

RYOKO
You and Kiyone are good friends.

MIHOSHI
Very good friends.  I love Kiyone.  We used to do everything together.
I miss those days.

RYOKO
Why are those days gone?

MIHOSHI
I gave Kiyone what she wanted.

RYOKO
Kiyone says some terrible things about you.

Mihoshi sighs.

MIHOSHI
I've heard what Kiyone says with her mouth, but I listen to what her
heart says.

RYOKO
What does that say?

MIHOSHI
She loves me dearly like a big sister.  She tries to be a role model
for me.  I usually don't pay any attention to that.  I try to bring
some happiness to her lonely life.

RYOKO
Lonely?

MIHOSHI
All Kiyone wants is recognition and promotion.  I don't care for any of
that.  Her ambition makes her lonely.  No one else, besides me, will try
to get close to her.  None of you even try to understand her.

RYOKO
I did try once.  You think you have everyone fooled by your act?

MIHOSHI
Oh my, I don't know what you are talking about.

Ryoko laughs and Mihoshi joins her.

MIHOSHI
Are you still afraid that I will jump you in your sleep?

RYOKO
I don't know if I would mind.

Both stare at the ceiling in silence.

RYOKO
Can you hear my heart?

Mihoshi looks over at Ryoko.

MIHOSHI
Yes.

Ryoko looks over at Mihoshi.

RYOKO
Will you always be there for Tenchi?

MIHOSHI
For as long as he needs me.

RYOKO
That could be for a long time.

MIHOSHI
I am happy with my life.  Time is one thing I have plenty of.

RYOKO
The job of third wife is still open.

MIHOSHI
It's not for me Ryoko.

RYOKO
Thank you Mihoshi, good night.

MIHOSHI
You are welcome Ryoko, good night.

INT. Tokimi's realm - DAY

Tokimi stands with her twin shadows of Washu and Tsunami.

D3 (O. C.)
I am losing control of this dimension.

TOKIMI
I do not understand what happened.  I separated Washu and Tsunami from
the boy.  Yet the boy still prevailed.

D3
There is another force, my Lady, influencing events.

TOKIMI
Yes, but which one.

D3
My Lady, is it wise to continue with this endeavor?

TOKIMI
I must know if he is the one.

D3
What if we try a different tactic?

TOKIMI
Yes that may work.  Well done D3

D3
Shall I implement the new plan?

TOKIMI
Yes.  I must know.  I must.

FADE OUT:

THE END


Bonus: Ayeka's Wedding Song (After the explanation for the song).

Ayeka has suffered much though her life.  This is reflected in her dealings with
others.  Ayeka always keeps a tight rein on her emotions.  She is often full of
self doubt, and fear of being less than the perfect princess.  For Ayeka to let
anyone see her true self would involve a great sacrifice on her part.  Such a 
sacrifice was needed for her to win Tenchi's love.

The lyrics to Ayeka's Wedding song were meant to reflect on Ayeka's doubts and fears.
I hope the words will bring you a better understanding of the Princess, and help you
feel some sympathy for her.

I can't write music, so if any of my readers wish to do so, then please do.
Contact me with your music and I will try to get this song recorded and
posted for all to enjoy.

Ayekas Wedding Song (Vocals by Ayeka)

I met you on that distant world
While I was searching for my love
And I knew when I first met you
You were sent from heaven above

You took me out to see your world
So that I could relax with you
You stole my heart and took my breath
Love that I could not admit to

How I long to bear my soul
To let you see inside
How I fear what you may find
The darkness that I hide

All those girls circling a round you
Against them I could not compete
Our time together all alone
I wanted always to repeat

Your soft touch is all I wanted
I could not let you see inside 
Afraid I hid in armor made
>From years of training hurt and pride

How I long to bear my soul
To let you see inside
How I fear what you may find
The darkness that I hide

I hated so that other girl
She stole your heart away from me
I could not change my formal ways
You saw her life so full and free

So she tried to keep me from you
To gain your love I would pursue
I would never let you go now
Surrender you I would not do

How I long to bear my soul
To let you see inside
How I fear what you may find
The darkness that I hide

Never would we give up trying
We would pursue you to the end
To lose you was my only fear
To capture you made her a friend

When we worked together now
We soon did have you at our side
There was no where for you to run
>From us you could no longer hide

How I long to bear my soul
To let you see inside
How I fear what you may find
The darkness that I hide

Now we are at last together
You taught me how to love and share
It matters not now my dark past
For me you always will be there

No more secrets left between us
Starting on this great endeavor
Not afraid with you here by me
Joy is ours now and forever

How I long to bear my soul
To let you see inside
How I fear what you may find
The darkness that I hide
