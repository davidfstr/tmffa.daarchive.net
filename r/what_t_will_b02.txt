TO THE READER:  Well hello again! Took me a while to get this one out but
here it is. And I have to say a big THANK YOU!!!! to all the readers out
there. I couldn't believe all the wonderful feedback I got, I was so 
pleasantly surprised. But don't think I got a big head; you gave me 
constructive criticism of the best kind. And plenty of ideas to go on! ;-)
That's all any writer could ask for- compliments and ideas! Thanks again,
everyone!


Oh and I must clarify, because some of my readers were confused. This fic
takes off of the movie with Haruna, but I had intended for it to also go off
the OAV. It has been brought to my attention that the movie was based off the
Universe TV series. The only reason I wanted this fic to be OAV based as well
was because in the OAV Washu was Ryoko's mother, and that is an important
part of this fic. So that is why Kiyone's there too and all that other good
stuff that makes up the differences in the diverse Tenchi world. Damn, why
does it all have to be so confusing?

Oh well, that's probably why we all love Tenchi so much!


Also, I do not own the Intermission music. It belongs to Bill Withers. I just
stuck in here because I thought it went well with the story. It helps if you
have heard the song before, to really get the feeling for it. Watch "Notting
Hill," it's in that movie.

Well I think that's all for now. Enjoy!

"What Tomorrow Will Bring"-Chapter 2: "Questions"

INTERMISSION MUSIC

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

I wonder this time where she's gone
I wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't a home
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't a home
Every time she goes away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

~~TENCHI~~

	I stared blankly at my alarm clock. It read 2 a.m.
      
	*Hoorah. Another hour's passed and I still haven't fallen asleep.*
In fact, I had been in that exact position for almost two days now. I got up
only to go to the bathroom and get the occasional glass of water. Nope, I 
hadn't slept, showered, eaten, or gone to school since that day.

	That day...

	I sat up. *This is useless. I'm never going to fall asleep so why 
bother.* I got out of bed and ventured downstairs. Figured I might as well
try to eat something. Even though I wasn't hungry at all. I had no desire to
eat. *All I want to do is sit in my room and contemplate how stupid I really
am. What a moron!*

	By the time I finished mentally bashing myself, I was standing in the
doorway to the kitchen. To my surprise, Ayeka was seated at the table; with
a box of Kleenex to her right and about a gallon of half-eaten ice cream to
her left.

	"Ayeka! What are you doing in here? You should be asleep!" I scolded.
She jumped at the sound of my voice, but calmed back down when she realized
it was me. She just grabbed a Kleenex and said hoarsely, "I could say the 
same to you." She blew her nose and sighed.

	I sat down next to her. "You couldn't sleep?"

	"I haven't slept since she left." Ayeka replied.

      "Me neither."

	"I never would have guessed that Ryoko's absence would make me so 
miserable." She shoved a scoop of ice cream into her mouth. "But it has."
She shoved about three more bites in. "Damn that Ryoko for making me fat."
Then she looked over at me and laughed bitterly.

	Despite my sour mood and lack of sleep, I had to smile. I never knew
Ayeka had such a great sense of humor. "Ayeka, I never thought I'd say this,
but sometimes you can be quite silly."

	The room became silent, as we were both lost in our own thoughts. I
broke the silence a few moments later. "Ayeka, how is everyone doing? I've 
been hiding in my room for the past two days, so I wouldn't know."

	She became sad suddenly. "Well, Kiyone and Mihoshi have been going 
about their schedules as usual. However, Kiyone is in the process of getting
a transfer, to another district. You see, now that Ryoko is gone, she doesn't
feel a need to stay. Ryoko is a space pirate, after all."

	"How is Mihoshi handling Kiyone's request for transfer?"

	"Oh, she doesn't know yet. My bet is, she'll be devastated and won't
let Kiyone go without her. So I presume they will both end up getting 
reassigned."

	"I see. What about Dad and Grandpa?"

	"Your father was very upset at first. Apparantly, Ryoko was his
'favorite', as he put it. He got over it quickly though. There'a a new 
secretary at the office he's positively smitten with."

	I rolled my eyes. "That's Dad for you."

	Ayeka continued. "Lord Katsuhito hasn't left the shrine often. At 
first he was upset when you didn't show up for training, but he said he 
understands and decided not to hold it against you."

	"How is Washu?"

	Ayeka sighed. "Not good. She hasn't come out of her lab, not even for
our soaps. I'm worried about her."

	I paused slightly before asking, "How is Sasami?" To my surprise, 
Ayeka grabbed my shoulders and pulled me close. "Oh Tenchi she's not handling
this well. Ryoko was like a sister to her, and Ryo-ohki was her best friend.
She's been cooking like crazy lately, trying not to think about our missing
friends too much. There's a great amount of surplus food in the house. She 
hardly says a word anymore." Ayeka let go of my shoulders and proceeded to
wipe her eyes with yet another Kleenex. She then put her head in her hands.

	*Poor Ayeka. This must be ripping her apart inside, but she doesn't 
want to admit it.* I put my arm around her. "And how is Ayeka?" I asked. 

	She smiled and sniffed. "Ayeka is confused. She thinks she should be
thrilled with Ryoko's leaving, but for some odd reason she is sad. I guess
Ryoko was her only true friend." Ayeka's voice cracked at that point and she
had to pause to collect herself.

	"Oh Tenchi I am so lost!" she wailed a few moments later. "I should be
happy! But I'm not. I'm miserable. I feel like she left because of me!"
Ayeka buried her face in my shoulder and sobbed openly.

	"That's not true Ayeka." I said, trying to comfort her.

	"Yes it is!" she wiped her nose with her sleeve. "Let me ask you 
something." She pulled away and gazed deeply into my eyes.

	"Be completely honest with me. Why could you never choose between 
Ryoko and I?"

	*BAM! Wasn't expecting that.* But Ayeka's question really got me 
thinking. Why hadn't I? It was a question I'd contemplated many times before,
but I could never come up with an adequate answer. So I decided to go with
the old response.

	"I care about you both so much, I didn't want to see either one of 
you hurt by my decision."

	Ayeka smiled and shook her head. "That's what I thought you'd say. I
used to think that you really loved me, and Ryoko was just in the way. Still,
I always knew you cared about both of us very much. I realized that after 
we came back from Haruna's world that what I had previously thought to be
true was a lie."

	I was confused. "What do you mean?"

	"You do not love me the way I love you, Lord Tenchi. You really love
Ryoko. Don't deny it now, I can feel it. The way you looked at her, the way
you acted around her, everything. You might care about me Tenchi, but not
the same way you do Ryoko. You love her." Ayeka paused to eat more ice cream.

	I was about to protest, but it looked like she had more to say so I 
kept my mouth shut. As I watched her shove more ice cream into her mouth, 
I pondered over what she just said. *Love...Ryoko? Do I? Did I? If I did love
her do I still love her? Maybe I do...NO. Tenchi, that's crazy. Ryoko was your 
friend, but LOVE. It's such a strong word, such a strong emotion. I don't 
think I'm capable of such a feeling. If I really loved Ryoko, I would have
definitely told her so a long time ago. Yup. That's the answer. I do not
love Ryoko.*

	"Ayeka, I don't think-"

	"Yes you do." she interrupted me. "Think about it, genius. Back when
Haruna had you kidnapped, and had completely taken over your memory, who was
the person you remembered when Ryoko and I came to save you?"

	"Ryoko." I whispered. *I had forgotten all about that.* I remembered
Ryoko. I used to have visions when I was living in Haruna's world, visions
of a certain cyan-haired girl. At the time I couldn't put a name with the
face, but I knew that she was beautiful, and I knew I had to paint her. Get
her out of my head. And when she came with Ayeka, I could hardly believe it.
I thought she was just a figment of my imagination. To see her standing 
right there in front of me was unbelievable.

	Ayeka interrupted my thoughts then. "When we finally figured out where
you were, I was so happy. I thought, 'surely Tenchi will recognize us and 
come back, eager to get away from that witch. But...Tenchi, you didn't 
remember me at all. You remembered Ryoko, but not me. That's when I first
realized that perhaps you cared for Ryoko more ." She finished with a sigh.

	*I had forgotten about that too!* I thought. "I'm sorry Ay-"

	"Don't be," she interrupted again. "I accepted the fact that you love
Ryoko even before we officially rescued you. That is why I told her to go 
and get you, in my place. She wasn't going to go, you know. She said that
that was going to be the last time you hurt her. She told me she had had
enough. But I convinced her to go. Because I believed that was how it was
supposed to be." Ayeka turned to face me then and smiled, unshed tears 
glistening in her ruby eyes. "And so I decided, Tenchi. Even if you haven't,
I have. You do not want me, therefore I do not want you. But I will always
love you Tenchi. Like a brother I will always love you." Then she turned
away from me and sobbed into her hands.

	"Ayeka-"

	"NO!" she turned and screamed. "I've made up my mind! Don't try and
change it!" And with that final outburst, she ran out of the kitchen. I 
could hear the front door shut not long after.

	I just sat there like the idiot I was, trying to let the enormity of
our strange conversation sink in.

	*Ryoko really did love me.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~AYEKA~~

	I ran. Like a little girl being chased by some evil monster I ran.
I ran all the way to Ryu-Oh. When I got there I just collapsed and sobbed
my heart out. *Did I do the right thing?* I was so confused.

	Just a year ago I never would have dreamed of saying such things to
Tenchi. I loved him, with all my mind, heart, and soul. He was the only man
I ever knew who didn't care a thing for my social status, and the only 
person who cared about me for me. 

	But that was a year ago. And things change.

	I believe Ryoko loved him for the same reason I loved him. He was 
probably the first gentle man she knew. And for that, I can sympathize with
her.

	I think Ryoko and I have more in common than we would like to admit.
We both have reputations we are trying to get away from, but can't seem to.
Everywhere she goes, she's the infamous Space Pirate Ryoko, the demon who
killed millions of people all over the universe long ago. And I am Princess
Ayeka, successor to the throne of Jurai. Not Ayeka. Not even Miss Ayeka.
Princess Ayeka. Soon it will be Queen Ayeka. And I will never be able to get
away from my title. No one will see the real me. I am destined to a life of 
falsehoods. 

	Now that I've told Tenchi I don't love him, he'll probably want me to
leave. I'll go back to Jurai, and end up marrying some disgusting suitor my
father has waiting for me. Then I will live a sad, empty life.

	*I'm never going to be happy again.*

	"Damn you Ryoko!" I shouted aloud, as I rolled on my back and gazed
at the stars. "Damn you for leaving and messing everything up!" 

	I continued to observe the stars. *So beautiful...*

	I don't know why I am so sad. I had suspected things would change when
Ryoko and Tenchi got back from Haruna's world. And when Ryoko went up the
mountainside to see Tenchi and I didn't even care, I was certain things 
would change. But still, I had no idea Ryoko was even thinking about 
leaving the family for good.

	*I wonder where she is right now.* I thought as I watched a passing
meteor streak across the night sky. *I wonder if she's thinking about us.
I wonder if she realizes how much of an impact she's made.* Probably not.

	I smiled despite the tears rolling down my cheeks. I remember when I
first laid eyes on Ryoko. It was so long ago, but it feels like just 
yesterday when I first discovered my feelings for Tenchi and we had our 
first argument over him.

	 I laughed in rememberence. Ryoko was the first person to show a
absolutely no respect for my crown. And for that I thank her.

	*Thank you Ryoko. For everything. Thanks for teaching me to open up.
Thanks for arguing with me, when no one else dared to. Thanks for staying up
with me the nights Tenchi was gone, and listening to me vent about how
horrible it was that he was with some dead slut. Thanks for being there.*

	Yes, I know now that things will never be the same. But change is 
good. And I might even see Ryoko again someday.

	"Goodbye and good luck Ryoko..." I mused aloud before drifting off
to sleep.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~WASHU~~

*flashback**

	"Mommy mommy come see what I did!"

	"Can it wait Little Ryoko? Mommy's very busy with her experiments
right now."

	"Please Mommy please? You'll be real proud of me. I'm a genius 
scientist just like you!"

	"Well all right Little Ryoko. Can you bring it to Mommmy?"

	"No no no Mommy, you have to come see it for yourself!"

	I sighed. "Okay, here I come." 

	I heard childlike giggles coming from the next room. As soon as I 
walked in, my 5 year old daughter dashed up to me, holding something behind
her back. If her smile was any larger, it would have taken over her whole
face. 

	Despite frustration caused by my latest series of experiments, not to
mention lack of sleep, I had to smile. My daughter looked so cute, with that
little Science Academy uniform I made for her and her cyan hair pulled into
a side ponytail. 

	"All right Little Ryoko. What is it you want to show Mommy?"

	"Okay here it is!" she exclaimed excitedly. She pulled out a small
metallic device. "Ta-da!"

	I had no clue what it was. "What is it, dear?"

	She giggled. "Can't you tell? It's an electromagnetic hydrodynamic
model of a multisecular dental hygiene device!"

	"A what, sweetie?"

	"It's a motorized toothbrush, silly. Lookie, when you push this 
button, it says, 'Remember to brush twice daily!'" And sure enough, when she
pushed the button, the brush spoke, 'Remember to brush twice daily!' in a 
sort of sing-songy voice.

	I was speechless. My five year old daughter had just made her first
invention. I was near tears the whole time Ryoko was explaining how it 
worked.

	"...And if you push this button, it tells you the date, time, 
barometric pressure, and it even gives you a little weather report! So
Mommy, what do you think?"

	"I love it Little Ryoko!" I scooped my daughter into my arms and
hugged her tightly. "I'm so proud of you. Can Mommy take a picture of you
and your invention?" I asked, setting her down. I always carried a camera
with me. Ever since Ryoko was a baby she did cute things that required a
picture to embarass her with later!

	"Pose and say 'Hyperbolic Lithuanium!'

	"HYPERBOLIC LITHUANIUM!!!" Ryoko yelled, with her toothbrush right
next to her mouth.

	"Come on sweetheart, let's go to the cafeteria. Do you know what this
deserves?"

	"A brownie?"

	"Two brownies!"

	"Yippee! Woo-hoo! Come on Mommy, lets go right now!" And with that my
daughter grabbed my hand and practically dragged me out of the room.

**end flashback**

	I turned the page of the photo album and sighed. I remember that day
so well. It feels like just yesterday, although it was over 5000 years ago.

	I remember how happy Ryoko was with her accomplishment. Back then she
was always happy. Up until she was 13...

	I think about how my Little Ryoko then, and how she is now, and I 
can't believe it's even the same person. I wonder, how did my sweet little
girl turn out to hate me so much? And then I remember.

	Kagato.

	He did this to my family.

	If it weren't for him, who knows what would have happened. Ryoko
wouldn't have had to kill thousands of people against their will, and I 
wouldn't be so screwed up.

	Am I screwed up?

	I don't know anymore.

	I stopped thinking for a moment and looked out the window of my room.
Contrary to popular belief, I have a room, complete with furniture, a closet,
and a bathroom connected to it deep inside my lab. I have it so secure, not
even Mihoshi could find it. Half the time I'm in my lab 'experimenting' I'm
actually in here, looking through my possessions. There are so many good
memories in these possessions...

	...And so many bad.

	I looked at the artificial landscape that lay before me. I had a 
backyard too, with a swingset, a pond, and lots of plant life found from
many different corners of the galaxy. Of course it wasn't 100% natural, but
it still looked beautiful.

	So beautiful...

	*Ryoko. My daughter. Where are you?* I called out through the link.

	Silence.

	Either Ryoko had shut down her side of the link, or she was too far
away for it to work. Probably both.

	I went back to my bed, upon which the photo album lay, and started to
flip through the pages again. I frowned. *So out of order. I really need to
organize.* On the next page was a series of pictures on Ryoko's 13th 
birthday. We had the party the day before Kagato...

	Anyway, the first photo was of Ryoko in a blue and white sundress. She
was surrounded by presents, and there was a mile-wide grin on her face.

	The next was of her with her two best friends, Suki and Kataru. I 
smiled in rememberence. *Those girls were inseparable.* And then I frowned.
*They were so sad when they found out what had happened to Ryoko and I...*

	I looked at the next picture, which was of Ryoko and I. She was 
holding a sign that had an arrow pointing to me, and underneath the words
'Best Mom In The Universe' were written. Tears that I couldn't control 
welled up in my eyes and spilled down my cheeks. *Best mom...I had forgotten...
how close we really were...* I buried my face in my pillow and sobbed. 
*What did I ever do to deserve what Kagato did to me?* I wondered sorrowfully.

	*I can't believe she's gone.* was the last thought that ran through
my head before I drifted off into a restless sleep.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~WASHU'S DREAM SEQUENCE~~

	"Washu..."

      What? Who's calling my name?

	"Washu..."

      Who is it? Who's there?

      "Washu..."

      "Who's there?" I called out into the darkness.

      Silence.

      Silence and darkness.

      Wait, what's that over there?

      A figure. A woman. A goddess?

      Tsunami?

      "Is that you Tsunami?"

      "Yes Washu. It is I." the goddess spoke before phasing in closer to
where I stood.

	"Why do you want to talk to me, Tsunami?" I questioned.

	She sighed. "Trouble is brewing."

	"What do you mean?"

	She smiled at me, almost in a sad way. "Do you know who I am, Washu?"

	I scoffed. "Of course! You are the goddess Tsunami! Everyone who's
anyone knows who you are!"

	"Yes, I am that. But I am also more than that to you Washu." She 
smiled again and put a hand on my shoulder.

	I was confused. "What do you mean by that?"

	"Washu you are my older sister and therefore a goddess like me."

	"WHAT?!" I shrieked, wrenching out of the grip she had on my shoulder.
"That's impossible! If I were a goddess, wouldn't I have goddess powers like
you?"

	Tsunami shook her head. "Not necessarily. You see, you used to be a
goddess. Until Tokimi and I started having dissagreements over the way the
universe should be run."

	"Who is Tokimi?"

	"Our older sister. You see, she wanted total domination over all 
mortal beings. She wanted to be able to create or destroy whenever she felt
the need. I, on the other hand, wanted to create a people and just watch
them fulfill their lives; I only wanted to guide them. I did not want the
total control Tokimi desired. Because we could not reach a compromise, we
brought you into our disputes, sister. Each of us tried to persuade you to
agree with our individual opinion. For if it was two against one, the other
would be driven away.

      "But you didn't want to get involved at all. I suppose we pushed you
a bit too hard to decide and you snapped. Without any warning you gave up 
your goddess powers and became an immortal human."

      *Oh my God.*

	"Tokimi was furious. She was going to kill you and destroy the rest
of the universe right then, but I convinced her not to by saying that she
could control half the universe, while I took the other half, and we would
both leave you alone. 

	"She agreed to my proposal then. But it has been many millions of
years since then. And Tokimi is evil and power-hungry. She is not going to
stand by and mind her own business anymore. She is preparing to wage war
against me as we speak!"

	"So what do you want of me, Tsunami?"

	"Nothing, dear sister. I have just come to tell you of your past and
to warn you. Something bad is going to happen. And you are going to have
to make a choice. I cannot stay anymore. Goodbye."

	"Wait, no! Don't go Tsunami, I don't understand!" I called out, 
reaching for the goddess that was slowly fading away.

	"Goodbye, Washu..."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~CONSCIOUS WASHU~~

	I sat up abruptly in bed. I whirled around. It was about 3 p.m. 
Sunlight danced around my room and cast shadows on the wall as I breathed
heavily and held my head in my hands.

	*Oh my God. Oh my God.*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~KIYONE~~

	I sighed and leaned back in my chair on Yagami. *Sometimes this job is
so boring.* I mused as I turned to look at my partner.

	Sound asleep, snoring, and drooling.

	"Mihoshi, you fool." I spoke under my breath. Seriously, how much
sleep do you need?

	But I can't say I blame her. For some reason, I had been sleepy a lot
lately too. And weak. Not willing to do much. Sluggish. Maybe it's because
of Ryoko's absence. In a way, that had changed all of us. 

	I turned to look out the window. *I wonder where she is right now.*

	Suddenly, a siren went off on Yagami. I clicked away on the control 
pad. Screens popped up, revealing the problem. A mere traffic violation; 
speeding. I pressed the intercom button. "Allright sir or ma'am, this is the
Galaxy Police. You have been caught going 650 in a 540 zone. I'll have to 
ask you to stop so I can write you up."

	A voice answered me through the intercom. "Kiyone? Is that you?"

	I knew that voice! "Ryoko?!"


					END CHAPTER TWO
