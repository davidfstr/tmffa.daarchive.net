Authors Notes : Okay, here's the skinny on my little
situation here.  I accidentally switched "Tenchiverses" when
I got halfway through Chapter One.  This story was meant to
be based on the TV continuity, but I accidentally changed it
to the OAV series.  Sorry.  I have now decided to mix the
two continuities into one bad ass cocktail.  Just pretend
certain events in the TV series continuity occurred in the
OAV series, like TMIL, and that certain TV characters were
in the OAV series.  I hope that clears up some of the past
confusion and more in the future.  And now, we begin...

************************************************************

	Takeshi was dumbfounded by the events that have
occurred in the past few days.  First, the emperor is
killed, then Jurai disappears, he finds out that the
legendary warrior Yosho is his father, and now, here he is,
on his way to Orion to meet with the rest of the Juraian
royal family.  Then he began to think, 'Now that the Emperor
is dead, will Yosho try to take his place?'.  But he kept
such thoughts to himself.  Why else would Yosho run away to
a small, out of the way place like Earth?  To escape from
the responsibilities of becoming an Emperor.  Yosho didn't
want that kind of pressure on him, and Takeshi could
understand.  He sat quietly as the transport ship carried
him, his mother, Yosho... er, his father, and some half
frozen human to the Orion system.

************************************************************

	Ayeka sat in a plump, comfy chair in the apartment her
and Ryoko shared, lightly dozing off.  She was nearly asleep
when a ringing startled her awake.  A second later, the desk
clerk of the hotel appeared on a monitor that popped up out
of thin air.  Ayeka did not look happy.

	"Yeeesss...?  What is it?" Ayeka spat out.

	"We...well ma'am, you have visitors." The Desk clerk
muttered.  Ayeka's eyes widened in slight surprise.  

	"Visitors?  Here?" Ayeka said to herself as she got up. 
As she exited the room, she looked back at Ryoko, who was
sprawled out on the bed and snoring loudly.  Her expression
of annoyance faded into a kind one.  'Sleep well, Ryoko. 
You deserve it.'  Ayeka thought as she quietly shut the
door.  

************************************************************

	"YOSHO!" Ayeka yelled, her expression joyous.

	"Hello Ayeka." Yosho said as he slightly diverted his
eyes.  How was he gonna tell her about Sasami?  What about
Keiko and Takeshi?  All and all, she was NOT gonna be happy. 
'I'll have to tell her about her sister eventually, and that
will be the biggest blow to her.  I'll tell her after the
shock of hearing about Keiko and Takeshi wears off...' he
thought.  Ayeka then ran up to him and gave him a big hug. 
'She's becoming more and more like her mother...' his
thoughts continued.  Ayeka was hugging him for a while when
she noticed a young man, and an older woman standing behind
him.  A look of curiosity flooded her happy face.

	"Oh... my.  Yosho, who are these two?" she asked
politely.

	"This, Ayeka, is Keiko.  She was a servant girl of the
palace right about the time when I left, and this is her son
Takeshi." Yosho said, somewhat nervously, as he broke his
embrace with Ayeka.  Ayeka bowed politely to them, saying
"How do you do?" to each of them.  'Poor Ayeka, she actually
looks happy.  I hate to have to do this to her..." Yosho
thought, his expression darkening.  Ayeka noticed this.

	"Yosho, what is the matter?" she asked, a little
worried.

	"Ayeka, I have some... disturbing... news for you." 
Yosho told her, his expression serious. 

	"What, Yosho?  You can tell me anything." Ayeka
reassured him.

	"Well, in that case... I have a secret to tell you
Ayeka.  I was unfaithful to you during our engagement. 
Takeshi is not only Keiko's son, he's mine also..." Yosho
said, his head lowering.

	Ayeka's eyes widened in shock as she stepped back a few
steps.

	"You mean to tell me that he... is your son!?"  Ayeka
questioned as she pointed at Takeshi.  Yosho only nodded.

	"Whe... when was this?" Ayeka asked.

	"The night of our engagement." Yosho said in a low,
defeated voice.

	"WHAT!?"  Ayeka screamed, her voice nearly shattering
the lobby windows.  Yosho saw that she was beginning to cry.  

	"How... how could you?!  On the night of our
engagement!?"  Ayeka screamed, her knees weakening.  Yosho
was prepared to catch her.  Ayeka took some more steps back.

	"Get... get away from me!  I don't even want to SEE
you!"  Ayeka screamed as she turned around and ran back to
her room.  Yosho felt lower than he ever had before.  He had
hurt the one woman who had loved him faithfully for over
seven hundred years.  He was going to run after her, but a
gentile hand stopped him from going.  He turned around and
saw Keiko.  She was shaking her head "no".  Yosho sighed and
looked back at the direction at which Ayeka had run off to. 
He then looked back at Keiko.  Takeshi was in the middle of
it all and was lightly shaking his head.

	"Women.  I'll never understand them.  Why did she take
it so hard?  Well, as mom always says 'With age comes
experience.'"  He said to himself.  He broke out of his
little self conversation just in time to see his parents
walk off toward the desk to get a room...

************************************************************

	Ayeka threw open the door and slammed it shut, all the
while crying her eyes out.  The noise of the slamming door
woke up the slumbering Ryoko, who gave a loud yawn, her
mouth opening wide like a lion.  She scratched herself on
the side and lazily looked at Ayeka.  Her contented, sleepy
expression turned into one of concern.  She slowly moved to
Ayeka.  She was within a foot away from her when Ayeka, red
from the powerful crying she was doing, turned her angered
gaze on Ryoko.  Ryoko then stopped as Ayeka shouted at her : 

	"GET AWAY FROM ME!!"

	The tone of her voice, and the loudness, caused her to
jump all the way back to her original position.   She then
watched as Ayeka resumed crying.  Ayeka did her typical
'hugging her knees' thing she did whenever she got seriously
angry and sad.  Ryoko began to feel sorry for her.  And she
was surprised when Ayeka turned her head to her again and
spoke to her again, but in a different manner.

	"Why!?  Why do men have to do that!?  Why do they feel
the need to go around and FUCK everything that is female!? 
I thought Yosho was different from all the rest, but I was
wrong.  Oh, how could I have been so BLIND!?"

	Ryoko was taken back by the volume and content of what
she said.  'Yosho?  He cheated on her?  Yosho?  I don't
believe it...' Ryoko thought, shocked and in denial.  She
then turned her still concerned gaze to Ayeka.

	"Are you saying that Yosho... Lord Katsuhito...
Grandpa... cheated on you when you two were engaged?  Are
you SURE?!" Ryoko asked, trying to understand the situation
completely.  Ayeka just nodded as she cried.  The reality of
this information hit Ryoko like a ton of bricks.  'Wow...
even Yosho is a pig.  That just... well... amazes me!  It
seems that the only decent guys are dead.'  Ryoko thought to
herself as she slowly crept over to Ayeka.  This time she
didn't yell at her.  She put an arm around the princess and
hugged her gently.  Ayeka saw this kind gesture and almost
fainted when she realized who it was coming from.  Ryoko,
her greatest enemy.  Her oldest rival.  Her best friend. 
She returned the hug and soon, was feeling a little better.

	"Thank you, Ryoko.  I needed a shoulder to cry on." 
Ayeka said in between the calming sobs.

	"Hey, don't mention it princess.  I got an idea.  Why
don't we go out and get drunk?"  Ryoko suggested.

	"I... I possibly couldn't.  Thank you for offering." 
Ayeka, a little shocked at the bluntness of Ryoko's
suggestion.  

	"Come on princess.  A few drinks'll do you good.  We
won't go alone, if that's what your wondering.  We'll go
find some of the others, like Togusa, Matsui, and Gillian. 
They're always a blast to drink with.  Come on.  It'll be
fun... and I guarantee that you'll forget this whole Yosho
business."  Ryoko told Ayeka, and convincingly.  

	"Well... oh, alright.  Fine.  But that's all.  Don't be
suggesting that we do anything else afterward, like, meeting
men."

	"Oh, don't worry princess.  When we clean you up, all
the men'll be wanting to meet YOU!"  Winked Ryoko slyly.  

	"What do you mean... clean me up?"  Ayeka asked, a
little curious, and a lot frightened.  

	"Well, you can't just go around Orion 3 in that
traditional Juraian get-up all the time.  You need to get a
change of clothes, girl.  Come on.  Gillian's about your
size.  We'll go borrow some of her clothes..."

	"No we certainly will NOT!"  Ayeka said, shocked at
such a suggestion.  

	"It's all part of the 'forgetting the ex-fiancee'
package.  You go out a totally different person, and you
come back a totally different, and a better feeling, person. 
Come on, try it."

	Ryoko looked at Ayeka.  Ayeka didn't say a word for
about a whole minute.  'Maybe she's actually considering it. 
Wait, this is Ayeka we're talking about.  She'll never agree
to...' Ryoko was thinking before she was interrupted...

	"Okay."  Ayeka muttered, a little bit ashamed.  

	"Wait... what did you say!?"  Ryoko said as she did a
double take.  She couldn't believe her ears.

	"I said 'Okay'.  But if anything happens to me that I
do not wish, I will hold you personally responsible, you got
me?"  Ayeka said, her voice stern.  

	"Yeah, yeah.  Got it.  Well, princess.  It's time for a
make over."  Ryoko said, grinning.  

************************************************************

	"I feel so... awful, Keiko.  All I want to do is go up
there and apologize.  But, I don't know what to say..."
Yosho said, his young face wearing a frown that almost made
him seem as old as he used to pretend to be.

	"She's going to be mad for a while, Yosho.  So would I,
but you have to let her figure this all out on her own. 
She'll come through, eventually.  She can't, and won't, stay
mad at you forever." Keiko responded, as she slowly caressed
Yosho's face.  Then, a question came to mind that would
change the subject...

	"Where's Nobiyuki?  Is he alright?"  she asked, her
voice full with concern.

	"He's at the hospital, getting treatment for his
frostbite.  It's amazing how he was the only one to survive. 
You know, Keiko, that's one thing I have to give to the
humans, they may not have very many powers, but they have an
indomitable spirit.  They're also like the cockroaches of
Earth, they can live through a great many attacks with all
sorts of evil, deadly weapons, and still come out
unharmed... and they also reproduce like them too..." Yosho
said, jokingly.  Keiko got it and giggled.  Yosho saw this
and began to laugh slightly.  Soon, they were both were
enjoying a much needed, healthy bit of laughter.  

	"You could always make me laugh Yosho.  That was one of
the things I always loved about you..."  Keiko mentioned
after much of the laughing subsided.  

	"Keiko... there's something I've been meaning to talk
to someone about..."  Yosho said, his face growing serious.

	"Talk to me.  I'll listen." Keiko said reassuringly. 

	"I've been thinking, Keiko, about the future of Jurai. 
Now that the planet is gone and the Emperor is dead, the
Empire'll soon be under utter turmoil.  They need a leader. 
And I am the only male heir to the throne.  I have been
thinking that I should resume my role as Juraian Royalty and
assume the throne before it is taken."

	"Do whatever your heart says Yosho.  Follow it's gentle
influence and you can never go wrong.  Always remember that
Yosho."

	"I will, Keiko.  There is also something else that I
wish to say."  Yosho said.

	"And what might that be, love?"  Keiko asked.  

	"Well,  when I become Emperor, I will need a queen and
an heir.  I wish for you and Takeshi to be there, by my
side."

	"Oh, Yosho..."  Keiko murmured, " I don't know what to
say..."

	"Then don't say anything..."  Yosho said as he kissed
his life long friend.

************************************************************

	"Well first, princess,  we need to get rid of... this." 
Ryoko told Ayeka as she pointed at her head ornament. 
Ayeka's eyes followed Ryoko's long pointed finger when she
pointed.

	"Must we...?"  Ayeka whined.

	"Definitely."  Ryoko said as she reached for it.  Ayeka
slapped her hand away, surprising Ryoko slightly.

	"I can do it..."  Ayeka mumbled as she reached up for
it.  Slowly, and reluctantly, the head ornament came off. 
Ayeka gently set it on the bed.  She turned back around and
saw Ryoko.  She was holding her chin and tapping her index
finger against her cheek.  Then, she stopped tapping.

	"The next thing we need to do is fix your hair."  Ryoko
said.

	"Why?!  What's wrong with it!?"  Ayeka shouted,
surprised.

	"It's too traditional.  Don't worry, I won't do
anything permanent.  Just... hold... still."  Ryoko said as
she walked behind Ayeka.  Ayeka felt Ryoko touch her long
hair and then she felt her fumbling with the string that
held her hair apart in two pony tails.  She felt her hair
fly loose as it joined into one mass.  Ryoko picked up a
brush from god knows where and began to brush.  Ryoko heard
Ayeka groan.

	"It took me hours to fix my hair up the way I wanted
it..."  Ayeka complained.  

	"Well, this'll only take a few minutes..." Ryoko said
in between strokes.  Ayeka let loose a discontented sigh as
Ryoko worked her magic.  She was almost done when a knock at
the door came.  Ryoko stopped brushing and answered it.  On
the outside was Togusa and Matsui.  

	"Alright... our we all ready?"  Togusa asked happily.

	"Whaa... how did you two get ready so fast?"  Ryoko
exclaimed, surprised.

	"What are you talking about?  We got your call, did our
three S's, ran a comb through our hair, put on something
decent and ran on over." Said Togusa, a little confused.

	"But I called you twenty minutes ago!"

	"Yeah, sorry.  We would have been here sooner, but
Gillian kept on bitching on how 'SHE needed to use the
bathroom too!'... but, all in all, I thought we made good
time."

	"Okay... you know, you guys have it easy..."  Ryoko
muttered as she looked at the two, surprised.  Then,
something came to mind that she didn't understand.

	"What're the three S's." She asked innocently.

	"You DON'T know what the three S's are?  And you LIVED
on Earth for HOW LONG?"  Togusa said, very shocked.  Ryoko
looked unimpressed and she looked like she was gonna slam
the door in their faces.  Togusa saw this and cleared his
throat.

	"The three S's... Shower, Shit and Shave.  It's a guy
thing.  I guess that's why you didn't understand..."  Togusa
said, trying to convince Ryoko to be nice.  He looked at
Matsui, who was laughing his silent little ass off.  Togusa
looked like he was gonna hit him.  But he didn't cause Ryoko
then asked him another question. 

	"Hey, where IS Gillian?"  Ryoko asked as she looked
down the hall for her.  

	"She's still in the shower.  She said it takes her a
long time to wash her hair.  I said 'Well, DUH!  Look at how
much you've got!  Girl, you need a hair cut.'  Then she
glared at me and gave me the finger."  Recalled Togusa.  

	"Uh, may we... come in?"  Togusa added.

	"Yeah, I guess so."  Ryoko said as she walked back over
to Ayeka.  Ayeka didn't look to happy at this. 

	"Are you SURE that they should be in here?  I mean, I
am gonna change clothing and there is no changing screens
here..."  Ayeka said, slightly blushing and a little
embarrassed.  

	"Don't worry Ayeka, it ain't anything they haven't seen
before... right guys?"  Ryoko asked the two young men
walking into the room as she continued brushing Ayeka's
hair.  The stopped, looked at her and nodded.  Then they
continued walking in and sat on the bed in front of Ayeka
and Ryoko.  They watched as Ryoko finished brushing Ayeka's
LONG purple hair.  

	"Man.  That is some hair.  Yours is almost as long as
Gillian's.  It's also a lot shinier too."  Togusa said,
transfixed by the methodical movement of Ryoko's brush.

	"Why... thank you..."  Ayeka said, somewhat flattered
and blushing a little more.  Then she smiled when she saw
the way the two looked at Ryoko brushing her hair and how
their eye's followed every stroke.  She stopped laughing
when another knock came at the door.  Ryoko momentarily
stopped brushing and saw Gillian, rapping on the open door.  

	"Uh... hi.  Sorry I'm late..."  Gillian asked.  Her
hair still looked wet and the tangled, like she rushed to
get over to Ryoko and Ayeka's apartment.  In her arms, she
carried several casual dresses.  She gently laid them on the
bed, away from Togusa and Matsui, and then sat down.  She
nodded hello to Matsui,  who returned it.  Togusa's eyes
rolled back into his head.  

	"There, finished with the hair."  Ryoko said as she put
down the brush.  Then she looked at Gillian and motioned to
the dresses.  Gillian got back up and retrieved them.  She
then ran over to Ayeka, the dresses still draped on her arm.

	"Well, guys.  This is the reason your still here.  Tell
us which one you like better." Ryoko said.  Both Togusa and
Matsui nodded their agreement.  Gillian began to lay dresses
over Ayeka.  Every dress that was previewed came with one of
Togusa's trademarked comments...

	"No, why would you want to be so cruel to Ayeka for?"

	"Ugh!  You actually WEAR that?"

	"Not unless the circus is in town."

	"Only if I was blind..."

	"AAAAAHHHH!  I'M BLIND NOW!  You might as well go to
the LAST dress... I'm only kidding of course.  NEXT!"

	"If Matsui could scream... I'm pretty sure he would. 
That is a true horror to behold and should be burned, so
that no one might happen to gaze upon it again."

	"My god...  NO!"  ( That one actually scared the girls
a bit... but pissed them off when he started to laugh...)

	"I thought we were trying to get Ayeka OUT of
traditional Juraian clothing..."

	"Eww... that looks like something that Matsui killed a
long time ago..."

	"Are we done yet, cause the bars close in eight
hours..."

	Finally, they were at the last dress.  It was a blood
red, little number.  It was respectable, yet something that
looked like Ryoko would wear.  Togusa and Matsui's eyes
widened as they started to cheer and clap.  Gillian, Ryoko,
and Ayeka frowned at them.  

	"Of course, it had to have been the last one..." Said
Ryoko.

	"And the one that had the less material..."  added
Ayeka.

	"And the one I borrowed from Washu..." Gillian
informed.  The group stared at Gillian for the longest time. 
A huge sweat drop formed on Gillian's head.

	"What?  So I borrowed it from Washu!?  I checked it
over.  It's a normal dress!  I'm serious!"  She pleaded. 
Ayeka and Ryoko sighed.  Ryoko walked over to Gillian, took
the dress, and handed it to Ayeka.  

	"Alright princess.  You know what to do."  She said as
Ayeka slowly grabbed the dress.  Then, swiftly,  Ryoko
grabbed Gillian.  Ryoko made her stand side by side with her
as she motioned for Ayeka to walk behind them.  Ayeka got
the idea and did so.  Both Togusa and Matsui sighed when
they saw this.  

	"Aww, man..."  said Togusa, quietly to himself.  But
Ryoko and Gillian both heard it.  They looked at each other
and, in unison, rolled their eyes.  Then a piece of clothing
was tossed over the two girls.  Togusa saw this and began to
crane his neck, trying to get a glimpse of what was going on
back there.  Gillian and Ryoko gave him a look that promised
death.  He gulped and settled down.  

	"There, done."  Ayeka said from behind the two girls. 
Slowly, Ryoko and Gillian separated to reveal the almost
complete, new Ayeka.  Before them stood a vision of beauty. 
But something was missing.  Then I occurred to Togusa.

	"Very nice.  Now there is only one final step."  He
blurted out.

	"What?" Ayeka asked, a little curious and frightened.  

	"MAKEUP!"  Togusa shouted like some movie director. 
Ryoko out on an 'Oh, yeah' face, as did Gillian.  But Ayeka
wasn't too happy.

	"Makeup?  Why do I have to put on makeup?  I never had
to before!"  Ayeka complained.  

	"It completes the picture.  You can't leave the room
looking as lovely as you do without any makeup.  It makes
you look... I dunno... incomplete."  Said Togusa.  Matsui
shrugged his agreement.  

	"Now see!  Even HE agrees with me.  Now THAT says
something in itself..."  Togusa added.

	"It means nothing..."  said Ayeka while she rolled her
eyes.

	"Well, you don't know them as much as I do.  If you
did, you'd be forced to agree..."  added Gillian.  Ayeka
gave a defeated sigh once again.

	"Oh... fine.  Let's get it over with.  And don't you
guys make me look like some... two bit whore either!" 
Threatened Ayeka.  The others agreed as Matsui grabbed a
chair and sat Ayeka down in it.  Togusa gave him Gillian's
box of makeup.

	"HEY! How'd you get that!?"  Gillian exclaimed.

	"Oh, be quiet woman.  Let the man do his work."  Togusa
said at the surprised Gillian.

	"Him?  Why give the makeup to him?"  Ryoko asked, a
little scared to find out the answer.

	"He's the artist in the family.  He'll make her look
just right.  Mom taught him how to do it.  It became his job
to put on her makeup after she lost the ability to use her
arms and legs."  Togusa added.  He looked over at his little
brother, who gave a depressed sigh as he looked through the
box.

	"What... happened?"  Asked Gillian when she saw
Matsui's reaction.

	"She contracted some virus.  It slowly destroyed her
central nervous system.  She lasted quite a while... but not
for too long.  When she died, it was just me and him.  Dad
disappeared from sight shortly after this silent little
faggot was born."  Togusa said as he lightly nudged his
brother, who gave him a haughty look of annoyance.  Then,
Matsui found what he was looking for.  A smirk flowed across
his face as he slowly, and ominously, moved in toward the
sitting Ayeka.  A look of fear swept her face when he saw
his demeanor.

************************************************************

	Yosho and Keiko walked, hand and hand, down the hallway
and towards the lobby.  They walked out into the somewhat
busy sidewalk and hailed a cab.  A yellow car hovered down
from above and the passengers side window opened up.  Inside
was a muscular man, wearing a bright orange muscle shirt. 
His short blonde hair almost made him look bald.  Yosho and
Keiko looked at the man curiously.

	"You getting in or what?  Come on!  I'm busy!" the
cabbie shouted.  Yosho and Keiko looked at each other as
they reluctantly got in.  The cab zoomed away at a quick
pace.  Just seconds after they left, three girls and two
guys walked out of the hotel and hailed a cab.  They waited
for a while.  They didn't even notice when another person
walked out of the hotel and asked if he could join.  After
an argument or two, the group accepted this young man into
their group.  As he joined them, another cab pulled up.  The
driver was nothing but an amorphous blob of green goo.  It
pulsated a few times before, reluctantly, the group crammed
into the cab.

************************************************************

	The disgusting blob of goo, whose name, by the way, was
"Snotty", stopped the cab in front of a loud, colorful, and
exclusive Bar / Night Club.  The newest member of the group,
Takeshi, slowly handed the blob a few Juraian bills.  The
cabbie bubbled a bit and the doors opened.  The group
inside, consisting of Takeshi, who put on a fresh set of
clothes, Ryoko, who, during Ayeka's facial, got into a
change of clothes and put on some makeup of her own,
Gillian, who did the same ( and managed to comb her
extravagantly LONG hair in the cab...), Togusa, who remained
the same as he did in the hotel, as did his brother Matsui,
and finally, Ayeka, the most nervous one of the bunch.  She
had trouble walking in the high heels that Gillian gave her,
and stumbled here and there.  She was mumbling something
when she finally caught up with the rest of the group.  They
began to enter when a massive, ugly looking cyborg blocked
their path.  He was towering above the rest of them and had
a pissed look on his face.  Suddenly, his uneasy demeanor
lightened up when he saw Togusa and Matsui.  

	"HEY!  How ya doin' guys?  Long time, no see, eh?" the
cyborg exclaimed.  The rest of the group just looked at
Togusa and Matsui in shock.  They looked indifferent.

	"Very long time, Abe.  So, how's the family?"  Asked
Togusa playfully, yet respectfully.

	"Oh, just great, thanks for asking.  Well, since the
last time you were here, we slightly remodeled the place.  I
hope you like it."  Abe informed.

	"Just as long as our old table's still there... right?"
asked Togusa sternly, yet with an air of humor.

	"HA!  You bet, man.  Go on inside.  Hey... those are
some pretty ladies you got with you."  Abe continued.  The
girls, and Takeshi, began to file in.  Abe then stopped
Ryoko before she could enter.

	"Hey... don't I know you from somewhere?"  Asked Abe.

	"No... well then, goodbye."  Ryoko said as she tried to
get past him again.  But it was futile.  Abe still made sure
she couldn't move.  Ryoko was getting a bit razzed by this.

	"Yeah, I do.  There's some woman in here with your
picture.  She's looking for you.  She keeps asking the
customers if they've seen ya.  I had to tell her several
times to stop pestering the customers, but she just laughed. 
The next time I go in there, I'm gonna kick her cute ass
out, her and her damn rabbit."  Abe informed Ryoko.  Ryoko's
eyes went wide as she looked passed Abe and into the
building.  And there, sitting at the bar, was Nagi.  Ryoko's
neck went limp as her head fell to her chest.  

	"Ah, great.  Now SHE'S here.  This evenings gonna be
just wonderful..."  Ryoko said solemnly.  Abe caught on to
this.  He put his massive, metal hand on her shoulder.  

	"Hey, sorry, I can't do anything.  Not until one of the
customers comes and complains.  But, hey, seeing as you came
with Togusa and Matsui, I'll keep an eye on her for ya.  You
just go have fun and ignore her."

	"Th... thanks!"  Ryoko said, taken back by this big
guy's generosity.  Happily, she entered the club.  Several
more people tried to get in with her, but Abe's massive
metallic hand blocked their path.

	"And WHERE did you think you were going?"  Abe asked
the small group.  The group of teens just gulped as Abe's
imposing shadow swept over them like the night.

************************************************************

	Yosho and Keiko got out of the cab, frightened for
their life.  The cabby looked at them with an intense, evil
eye.

	"Yeah, thanks for wasting my time pops.  And another
thing, you can't tip worth a SHIT!" the cabby screamed as he
lifted off into the rest of the city.  Yosho was almost red
with anger.

	"If I had been alone, I swear, I would have cut that
bastard's head clean off!"  Yosho spat as he made several
rude gestures, both human and Juraian.  Keiko, now dressed
in a very nice, formal, body hugging dress, grabbed Yosho's
wildly flailing arms.  She looked him in the eyes and
smiled.  Then she grabbed his hand and led Yosho, who wore a
fancy Juraian suit, into the very sheik, and expensive,
restaurant.  The snooty waiter led them to their table. 
Yosho pulled Keiko's chair out for her.  She smiled and said
thanks.  Yosho smiled back at the beautiful woman as he sat
down in his chair, right across from her.  Keiko gazed
lovingly into Yosho's eyes, as did he.  Keiko smiled, and as
she did, her nose scrunched up.  Yosho looked at her and
commented to himself on how cute she was.  They remained
like this until Keiko finally broke the silence.  

	"Yosho... I hate to be a spoilsport and bring up a
touchy subject, but this is something I have to know..."

	"I told you once before, you can say anything to me,
Keiko.  Especially now..."  Yosho said, still gazing into
her eyes.

	"What were they like?  Your family.  I mean, I met
Nobiyuki, but he wasn't really related to YOU... he married
your daughter.  I want to know about them."  Keiko asked,
her face growing slightly serious.  Yosho broke his gaze for
a second, and then gathered the strength to talk about his
deceased family.  

	"Well, my wife was the gentile sort, very traditional
in accordance to Earth's rituals.  So was my daughter,
Achika.  She was my greatest accomplishment.  She was
everything anyone could want their daughter to be.  It was a
shame she died so young.  And then, there's Tenchi, my
grandson.  He surprised me with his courage and devotion. 
Although, he did make a few mistakes in his life, but that
happens, it's natural to be flawed.  But, it was unfortunate
that he died.  I didn't think that that was how he was
supposed to go.  I had at least hoped that he would father a
child before he died, but, sometimes things happen that are
beyond our control.  All I can do now is avenge his death. 
I have to make sure that every last one of those vile, evil
creatures of darkness pays..."  Yosho vowed, clenching his
fists.  Yosho then felt a pair of soft, delicate hands cover
his fists.  He looked up at Keiko, who still looked at him
with her ever-loving eyes.  Yosho felt himself being calmed
as he looked at her lovely, amethyst eyes.  He calmed
himself, and he remained that way all through the dinner.  

************************************************************


	Togusa and Matsui flew into their typical booth at the
club as Gillian piled in after them.  On the other side,
Ayeka, Ryoko and Takeshi piled in.  Loud music filled the
area and bright lights flashed all over the dark club. 
Togusa had a LARGE smile on his face.  He was wearing a pair
of circular sunglasses.  Ryoko looked at him oddly.  

	"Why are you wearing those?"  she asked, pointing at
the sunglasses.

	"Because," Togusa added as he put a cigarillo in his
mouth, "I feel like it.  Okay?"

	"Alright, fine.  You're the one that looks like an
idiot, not me."  retorted Ryoko.  Togusa glared at her for a
moment, but then was distracted by Gillian, who was busy
dragging Matsui out of the booth.

	"Come on!  I love this song!  Please, just one dance! 
Just one!" she pleaded, knowing that he would give in.  And
give in he did.  Gillian pulled him out into the dance floor
and they began to dance together, totally in sync with the
others.  They soon blended into the crowd.  It wasn't long
before two handsome gentlemen came and asked Ryoko and Ayeka
if they cared to dance.  Ayeka blushed as the man that asked
her took her hand and gently led her out into the dancing
crowd.  The only ones left in the booth were Takeshi and
Togusa.  Takeshi then gazed a glimpse of a beautiful woman
sitting at the bar.  He looked at Togusa, and then sped off. 
Togusa's eyes rolled up into his head for a second,
concealed by the dark glasses.  Togusa looked around and saw
what Abe, the bouncer, meant by remodeled.  The place was
about eight times bigger.  It was huge the LAST time he was
here, and now, it was FUCKING AWESEOME, to quote Togusa's
thoughts.  He was brought out of his reverie by the sound of
a distant scream, that was getting closer and closer every
second.  Togusa finally saw what was making the noise. 
Takeshi flew past Togusa, who was sadly shaking his head. 
Takeshi finally came to a stop, with a little help from the
wall.  Takeshi stumbled his way back to the booth and sat
down.  He shook his head violently and tried to stop the
room from spinning.  Togusa began to laugh.  

	"Wh...what?  What did I do?"  Takeshi stuttered.

	"Man, you're hopeless.  Totally hopeless.  Get outta
here BOY, you're cramping my style."  

	"Oh, so your style consists of just sitting around,
doing nothing, is that it?"  Takeshi asked, with a high
level of haughtiness.  

	"Oh, you...are... gonna...die!" threatened Togusa. 
Togusa began to reach for Takeshi over the table. 
Frightened for his life Takeshi leaped out of the booth as
Togusa summoned his laser scimitar, which glowed brightly in
the dark club.  Togusa ran after Takeshi, growling.  As the
explosions began, the normal citizens ran out of the club,
fearing for their lives.  The only ones standing there were
Matsui, Gillian, Ayeka, Ryoko, ( Their dates had run off
with the crowd, despite the two girl's coercion. ), and a
the girl who had tossed Takeshi away, who was sitting at the
bar.  Ryoko turned and looked at this person, and her eyes
widened when she saw who it was.  Nagi.

	"Damn it."  She whispered.  

	Nagi's pointed ears perked up when she heard Ryoko's
voice.  The ball of fluff at her feet, Ken-oki, got up and
hissed.  Nagi, ever so slowly, turned around in her chair.

	"Why, hello...Ryoko." Nagi said in her deep voice.  

	"Crap..."Ryoko muttered as she rubbed her forehead. 
All of the others noticed this, except Togusa and Takeshi,
who were still fighting.  Takeshi ran from Togusa with the
speed and agility of an Olympian God, and Togusa continued
to slash at him, chasing him around, busting up tables and
destroying all sorts of merchandise.  Gillian, Ayeka and
Matsui walked up beside Ryoko and took defensive stances. 
Nagi just laughed as she tossed her hooded cape aside,
revealing her skin tight, black and blue battle uniform. 
Ryoko pushed the other three back.

	"No, this is between me... and her."  Ryoko growled as
she began to bear her fangs.  She quickly then summoned her
laser sword at the same time Nagi summoned her laser whip. 
Then the two yelled a battle cry as they leapt at each
other.  But, before the two could connect, a big, blurred...
thing... moved in between them.  With a pair of massive,
metallic arms, it grabbed Nagi and restrained her.  Ken-oki
began to bite at the intruders heel, but couldn't pierce the
hard metal.  Nagi swore in every language she knew as she
struggled to be free.  Ryoko, who stopped just in time,
hovered inches from a massive, tuxedoed chest.  She looked
up and saw Abe's smiling, metallic face.  She smile too.

	"I told ya."  Abe said, still restraining Nagi.  Ryoko
gave him a quick smile and a nod, and then waved to the
struggling Nagi.  She smirked as she slowly descended to the
ground.  Then, the entire group, sans Togusa and Takeshi,
ran out of the battered club.  Togusa and Takeshi stopped
their fight and noticed that everyone was gone.  Togusa got
confused for a second, then noticed Abe.

	"Hey, where did my friends go, man?"  Togusa asked,
still wearing those glasses.

	"They split faster than the wind, boy I tell you what. 
They went out the doors and turned to the left.  After that,
it's anybody's guess."

	"Thanks man.  I'll wire you the money for the repairs
on the bar..."  Togusa said, sadly. 

	"Hey, don't worry about it.  We've got it covered. 
Just do one thing for me though..."

	"Sure man, what?"

	"Take those DAMN glasses off.  They went OUT of style
since the last time you were here."

	"Really?  Damn, I really like these..."

	"Told you!"  Takeshi yelled from a distance.  Togusa
turned his head just in time to see Takeshi run out of the
building and too the left.  He grimaced and growled.  He
began to run after the little twirp.  But as he ran towards
the exit...

	"Hey Abe, thanks for a fun night.  I'll be back soon!" 
He yelled as he ran out the door.

	"Anytime old buddy!"  Abe shouted.  Then he looked at
the SERIOUSLY pissed off Nagi.

	"Now, if I let you go, will you be a good girl?"  He
asked, condescendingly.

	"Grrrraaaahhhh!  KEN-OKI!"  Yelled Nagi as, suddenly,
the white cabbit leaped towards the high ceiling and
transformed into a ship. 

	"Shit!  My ceiling!"  yelled Abe in distress.

************************************************************

	Yosho and Keiko stepped out of the restaurant, arm in
arm.  The laughed with each other and walked slowly down the
street.  But their laughter was interrupted by a series of
explosions nearby.  They turned quickly and saw a white
ship, like Ryo-oki and Leo-oki, only white, firing upon a
club of some sort.  Then he heard a commotion in the crowd
behind him.  He saw Ayeka, Ryoko, Gillian, Togusa, Matsui,
and Takeshi running at top speed, away from the explosions. 
They stopped as they reached Yosho and filled his once
peaceful life with unwanted hubbub.  They yelled at him to
run, but he didn't want to listen, cause if he did, it would
ruin his date with Keiko.  He just sighed, and continued
walking, ignoring them.  But ignoring them was hard,
especially when Ken-oki began to fire upon them!  Quickly,
as he dodged huge laser blasts, he tried to summon a cab. 
Finally, one stopped.  He looked at the driver through the
passenger's side window, and saw that it was the muscular,
blonde cabby from before.  Yosho almost did a face fault
when he saw this, but realized that this... vile...
individual was his only hope.  Luckily, the driver did not
see his face as he ran in the back seat, ducking just low
enough not to be seen.  Yosho was soon followed by the
others.  The muscular man sat there, not particularly
interested in the huge laser blasts that were being fired at
him.  Soon, the whole group got in.  He looked in the rear
view mirror and saw Keiko.

	"Hey,  weren't you already in this cab tonight?"  he
asked.

	"Yes...Yes!  I was!  Please!  GO!"  Keiko shrieked. 
She began to wonder WHY they haven't been hit yet.  

	"Yeah, I remember you now... where the hell's that
creep you were with.  I wanna tear him a new asshole."  The
muscular man said, enraged.

	"He, uh... I dumped him.  Now, please, get to the Royal
Orion Hotel, immediately!  And I mean FAST!"  Keiko shouted
as she handed him a bundle of cash that Yosho, still unseen,
had handed her.  The driver looked at the money and his eyes
widened slightly.  He started his hovercab and drove off,
very fast, causing his passenger's necks to rocket backward
in the aftermath of the raging G-forces.  But Ken-oki still
gave chase, and fired at the cab, his aim getting slightly
better with every shot, until he actually winged the cab. 
All of the women shouted as the cab rocked.  Matsui and
Togusa looked rather unimpressed and bored.  Matsui even
yawned and began to drift to sleep.  Togusa looked over at
Takeshi, who had fainted.

	"Heh... pussy."  Togusa muttered under his breath.  

	The cabby looked pissed after he took the hit.  

	"Alright, you bastard.  You wanna play it hard... we'll
play it hard..." he lowly muttered to himself.  The cab
suddenly jetted to the left, causing the still conscious
passengers to scream some more.  The cab flew through every
red light and dodged all sorts of traffic.  But still
Ken-oki persisted.  But, finally, the cabby lost him.  They
hid in a dark corner and waited till Ken-oki stopped
searching around and finally just flew away, into outer
space.  The passengers breathed a sigh of relief, at least
the females did.  The cabby then made his way back to the
hotel, slowly this time.  He finally stopped in front of the
large skyscraper and opened the passenger door.  The females
of the group, even Ryoko, literally flew out of the cab. 
Takeshi was woken up when Ayeka accidentally stepped on his
stomach and his mother grabbed his hand and dragged him out
of the cab.  Togusa casually woke up Matsui and the both
left the cab.  The only ones left were the cabby... and
Yosho who still tried to remain unseen as he crawled out of
the cab.  

	"Hey..."  the cabby said.  Yosho froze.  He closed his
eyes and hoped he didn't know he was back here.

	"Yeah, you.  Behind the seat.  Don't worry, all is
forgiven."

	"Really?"  Yosho said, as he peeked over the seat.  He
eventually got up off the cab floor and sat back in the
passenger's seat for a spell.  The cabby laughed.

	"Yeah. I mean, it's not every day that you get a fare
like this."  the cabby spoke, gesturing at the wad of cash
the he now had.  Yosho looked at the cabby, sternly, yet
gratefully.  

	"You know, there ARE better things than acquiring
wealth." Yosho finally said.

	"Yeah, I guess you're right.  You know, you have a nice
woman there.  Don't let her go."  The cabby muttered,
surprising Yosho.  

	"Yeah... boy.  She's a hot one.  Nice legs."  The cabby
continued, counting the money.  Yosho's surprised look faded
into one of disappointment.  The cabby saw this when he
looked at Yosho through the rear view mirror.  

	"Don't worry.  She's all yours.  I'm more into red
heads."  The cabby winked.  Just then, Washu, in her adult
form, walked outside the building and grabbed Yosho by the
sleeve.  She dragged him out of the cab and led him back
into the hotel.  All the while, the cabby was drooling and
taking pictures.  When Washu and Yosho disappeared into the
building, the cabby chuckled to himself and drove off. 
Yosho finally went back into his room, got out of his
constricting clothes and into something more comfortable. 
He plopped down on his bed and soon, was fast asleep...
