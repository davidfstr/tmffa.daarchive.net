                            INTERLUDE

Establishing Shot: Space... again.  Predominantly shown is a large 
planet that has come to be known as Earth.  A small twinkle is shown
in the space to the left of the planet, as a ship suddenly appears 
heading towards the screen.

                         KIYONNE (V.O.)
            Officer First Class Kiyonne, ships
            log, supplemental:  I have arrived in
            the system that the explosion assumed
            to have been from the A1 class criminal
            Kagato's ship, the Souja.

The ship continues to move forward passing the camera which follows
it as it moves into orbit of Earth.  As it passes we notice some
signage, the Galaxy Police insignia, a strange looking string of
characters, and the name YAGAMI in script near the front of the ship.
Cut to the interior of the ship a few seconds after it passes the 
camera to show KIYONNE sitting in a chair in the cockpit of the ship.
She is wearing her GP uniform, including her patented headband, under
a black leather jacket.

                          KIYONNE
            The system is classified as A031X in
            the Galaxy Police files, and is better
            known as the Sol System in reference to
            it's sun, the most energizing one on 
            this side of the galaxy.  It is well 
            known as the home planet of the Jurai
            Emperor's wife, Funaho, and has been
            for the last three millennia, under a
            non-interference status by the GP. In
            a hopefully unrelated event, this is
            the area of space that my late partner
            Mihoshi had last been at before she
            went missing.

KIYONNE turns in her chair to lean forward and hold her hand over one
of the buttons on the console beside her.

                          KIYONNE
            End ships log.

She presses down on the button and leans back in her chair.

                          KIYONNE
            Yukinojo, what's the report on the in
            system wreckage and latest energy 
            readings. <beat>

One of the bulges on the ceiling of the cockpit pushes its way down
and opens to show two optic sensors that almost look like eyes. It
descends to be a little more than two feet in front of KIYONNE.  When
it speaks, its top half and bottom half shake.

                          YUKINOJO
            In system data has been gathered and
            analyzed. There are four types of
            wreckage apparent in the surrounding
            space.

Behind YUKINOJO a viewscreen appears and displays various data about
shards of metal found in the wreckage.  As YUKINOJO speaks, KIYONNE 
takes off her jacket.

                          YUKINOJO
            Most of the wreckage conforms to readings
            and energy analyses performed during the
            several brief encounters with the Souja
            prior to now.  Percent of error on this
            fact factors down to five point three
            seven.

KIYONNE leans forward to look at the data.

                          KIYONNE
            Well, that was easy enough.  Don't really
            think they needed to pull me from that
            concert on Yavin to do this though. <beat>
            What's the data on the rest of that wreck
            out there?

                          YUKINOJO
            There are parts and debris from three ships
            that are well documented in GP files. The
            ships are the GP ship 'Pure Heart', the
            Royal Jurai ship Ryo-oh, and the once wanted
            criminal Ryo-ohki.

KIYONNE suddenly cringes and makes motions that she's dying.

                          KIYONNE
            The <beat> 'Pure Heart?'

                          YUKINOJO
            Affirmative.  The Galaxy Police ship 'Pure
            Heart' is currently issued to--

                          KIYONNE
            Don't say it!  I don't want to be hexed by
            saying <beat> that evil incarnation's name.
            Can you determine if there is enough wreckage
            of the 'Pure Heart' to conclude that the ship
            was completely destroyed and further
            investigation isn't necessary?

YUKINOJO makes a motion with its optic sensors that resembles
blinking.

                         YUKINOJO
            <flat> Negative.

                          KIYONNE
            Shit.  I wish I stayed at the concert.
            Even if 'Suicidal Salarians' was playing
            it would be better that finding out that
            SHE is still alive.

In the Masaki house, the gang is eating Lunch around a table.
MIHOSHI suddenly sneezes.

                           ADAM
            Bless'you.

                         MIHOSHI
            Thank you.

                          TENCHI
            <smiling> Someone must be talking about
            you, Mihoshi.

                         MIHOSHI
            Oh! I hope its something nice.

             Episode 6: The Calm Before The Storm

Establishing Shot:  Washuu's lab.  The floor is indiscernible from the
walls, if there are any, but by the way all the equipment is positioned
it looks like it's a small room.  WASHUU is typing on her holographic
keyboard while ADAM tries to wiggle his arm free from a vice that is
holding it under some incredibly large examining device.  She turns to
ADAM and stops typing.

                          WASHUU
            Very interesting. <beat> Much more
            efficient than Ryouko's design.  Not
            very high on aesthetics though. 
            Doesn't look comfortable either. Are
            you in pain?

                           ADAM
            Not anymore, it was painful at first
            but not anymore.  It is very,
            inconvenient though.  Think you could
            remove it?

                          WASHUU
            <long and drawn out> Well... I suppose
            after extensive testing I could.  Maybe
            a look under the intense invasive radianic
            scanner would better inform me.

                           ADAM
            Forget it, I'll just have Ryouko rip it
            off my palm.  I'm sure she won't have
            any problems with that.

                          WASHUU
            Nonsense, Ryouko holds you in the
            highest respect.  Higher than me these
            days.  She thinks you quite the man.

                           ADAM
            <sarcastically> I'm sure.

                          WASHUU
            Well, she doesn't want to kill you
            anyway.  It's more than I can say
            about most people in this house.

                          SASAMI (O.S.)
            Washuu? Adam?  Dinner's ready!

                           ADAM
            Oh good, I'm starved.

                          WASHUU
            I guess I could take a break from
            my strenuous work.

                           ADAM
            <sarcastically> Oh sure, highly
            strenuous.

WASHUU looks back and hits a button on a panel causing the vice around
ADAM's arm to tighten abruptly.  His hand turns beet red and he
struggles violently.  WASHUU laughs satanically.

Cut to the forests surrounding the lake.  A small dirt path is
surrounded on both sides by tall trees that reach up into the sky but
don't block the constant stream of light pouring in.  The trees sway
back and forth suddenly and there is a large flash of yellow light that
quickly dissipates and leaves KIYONNE behind.  She holds up a cube that
shows what looks like a compass.

                         KIYONNE
            Damn, her homing signal is still
            Strong. <beat>  Enormous amounts
            of high energy potential around,
            I wonder if there's been some 
            contamination from the explosion of
            Kagato's ship.

KIYONNE walks down the path with her head down watching her cube.

Cut to Masaki household interior.  AEKA and RYOUKO are watching what
looks like a soap opera, SASAMI is playing with RYO-OHKI by the window.
 Zoom to show television.

                           MAN
            Exactly what you wanted, forty
            pounds of rice from the market.
            Now, you know what I want in return.

                           WOMAN
            I <beat> I don't know if I should.
            What if my husband finds out?

                            MAN
            You know you want to, and he won't
            care if you do.

Cut to RYOUKO and AEKA.  Their eyes widen and they lean forward towards
the television.

                           WOMAN
            Well, I suppose it'll be alright,
            as long as it's quick.

                            MAN
            You can do it as quick as you want
            it to be, I just want it so much.

RYOUKO is almost drooling, AEKA is biting on the ends of her robe.  Cut
to the television screen.

                          WOMAN
            Okay.  Let's do it! I'll cook
            Lunch for you!

                           MAN
            I'll get the hibachi!

Cut to RYOUKO and AEKA.  They both face fault and RYOUKO falls on the
ground.  AEKA quickly picks up the remote control, turns off the
television, and starts walking off.

                           AEKA
            I wonder what Tenchi is doing.

                          RYOUKO
            I think I'll see what Washuu is
            working on.

                        SASAMI(O.S.)
            Hey everybody! Look what's going
            on outside!

AEKA and RYOUKO turn to look out the window.  Cut to exterior of Masaki
household.  Rather large flakes of snow are falling but have yet to
accumulate on the ground.

                          SASAMI
            What is that?

                          RYOUKO
            Oh great, SNOW. <beat> I really
            hate the weather on this planet.
            I can't stand the cold.

                          SASAMI
            Looks like fun. <looks down> Come
            on Ryo-ohki, lets go outside and
            play!

                           AEKA
            Isn't a little unusual to have snow
            in this area of Earth?

                          RYOUKO
            Yeah, I think the last time it snowed
            was close to ten years ago.

The door to WASHUU's lab opens and ADAM walks in.

                            ADAM
            Hey! Snow!  I was wondering if we were
            still in a temperate zone.

                           RYOUKO
            Don't tell me YOU like snow.

                            ADAM
            Oh yeah! I love snow.  Don't know why,
            just do.

                           SASAMI
            Adam, you want to come play in the
            snow with me?

                            ADAM
            Uh, sure.  I'm done with my work for now.

                            AEKA
            Work? What work are you doing?

                            ADAM
            I'm working with Washuu on something
            special.  She says it's something that
            has been on her mind for the last 1200
            years.  I can't say what it is yet.
            <beat> Mostly because I don't know.

ADAM reaches into the doorway and pulls out a black trench coat.

                           ADAM
            Okay Sasami, lets go!

ADAM and SASAMI walk out the glass door with RYO-OHKI.  AEKA and RYOUKO
look at each other for a moment then RYOUKO walks past AEKA and into
the doorway to WASHUU's lab.  A few seconds later TENCHI walks in with
a held out fist.

                          TENCHI
            Oh Aeka! I was looking for you.

                           AEKA
            <hopeful> Oh, you were, Lord Tenchi?

                          TENCHI
            Yeah, I need to give you something.

TENCHI opens his fist and in his palm is a large seed with a few buds
already sprouting from it.

                          TENCHI
            Tsunami told me to give this to you,
            she said it was Ryo-Oh's seed.  It
            seemed very important, so I didn't
            want to forget.

AEKA looks at the seed in his hand and picks it up with her two
fingers.

                           AEKA
            Thank you very much, Lord Tenchi.
            <beat> This is all that is truly
            left of my ship, Ryo-Oh.  But
            hopefully I can grow a new tree
            from this bud and Ryo-Oh won't
            really die.  <beat; saddened>
            But I'm not sure it can grow in
            Earth's soil, and if it takes root
            it'll be stuck here forever.

                          TENCHI
            Oh, <beat> maybe you can get Washuu
            to make you something!  She is a
            genius, after all.

                           AEKA
            Yes... yes, maybe she can. I'll go
            talk to her about it.  Thank you
            again Lord Tenchi.

There is an uncomfortable silence and AEKA and TENCHI just look at the
floor.  Suddenly AEKA looks up at TENCHI.

                           AEKA
            So, have you seen the snow yet?

                          TENCHI
            Snow?

TENCHI looks past AEKA and out the window to see the white flakes
dropping the ground.  The snow is starting to accumulate and SASAMI and
ADAM are making snowballs by the lake.

Cut to a blurry, black and white scene with a young TENCHI playing
around in the snow seeming very happy.  A woman walks up in robes with
a parasol whom we can't see the face of.  Cut to TENCHI's view as he
looks up at the woman, her face shrouded in the shadow of the parasol.

                          WOMAN
            Having fun Tenchi?  You better put
            on your coat though, or you'll catch
            a cold.

                          TENCHI
            Awww, mom, it's not that cold out.

                          WOMAN
            <laughs; warmly> No, not now, but it 
            will be. So make your poor mom happy
            and put on your coat.

                          TENCHI
            Okay mom.

                         AEKA(V.O.)
            Tenchi?

Cut back to Masaki household interior.  AEKA is looking at TENCHI
strangly.

                           AEKA
            Tenchi?  Are you alright?

                          TENCHI
            Huh? <beat> Yeah, I was just remembering
            something from when I was young.

There's a loud smack and TENCHI and AEKA look outside to see a large
white splotch on the glass door.  Outside SASAMI is laughing and ADAM
is smiling at the window.  He seems to mouth the word, "Sorry," through
his smile.  TENCHI sighs.

Cut to Masaki Shrine.  YOUSHO is standing on the porch of the shrine
watching the snow fall with a cup of tea in his hand.

                          YOUSHO
            Hmm... <beat> It was on a day like
            today that it all happened.

KIYONNE suddenly emerges from the trees covered in snow, still holding
the cube in front of her.  She's shivering quite violently as she walks
out of the trees.  YOUSHO picks up an umbrella and starts walking over
to her.

                          KIYONNE
            <to herself> Damn you Mihoshi. Even 
            when you aren't here you're causing
            me trouble.

                          YOUSHO
            Excuse me miss.

KIYONNE jumps, startled by YOUSHO's voice and that he's holding the
umbrella over her.

                          YOUSHO
            It is very cold out and you don't
            seem to be prepared for the weather,
            perhaps you should come inside and
            warm yourself before you continue on
            your way.

KIYONNE debates it in her mind for all of half a second before she nods
her head and walks with YOUSHO back to the shrine.

Cut to shrine interior.  YOUSHO is pouring KIYONNE a cup of tea.

                          YOUSHO
            So tell me who you are and what you
            are doing out in the snow.

                          KIYONNE
            My name is Kiyonne, and I'm a police
            officer First Class.  I was send out
            here to look for one of our missing
            officers, we found some evidence that
            suggested she might be here.

YOUSHO nods silently, absorbing the information.

                          KIYONNE
            I wasn't expecting any snow because the
            sky was clear earlier today, so it
            caught me off guard.

                          YOUSHO
            So how did you end up in the forest.
            There is a direct path to the house
            from the road.

KIYONNE rubs the back of her head and smiles nervously.

                          KIYONNE
            Well, I wasn't really looking where
            I was going and by the time I realized
            I was lost, I couldn't retrace my
            steps anymore.

                          YOUSHO
            Hmmm... I heard you talking about
            Mihoshi before.  Is she the missing
            Officer you were sent to find?

KIYONNE drops her cup and lunges over to YOUSHO.  She grabs him by his
collar and pulls him forward.

                          KIYONNE
            <tense; loud> Do you know who she
            is?  Have you seen her? Where is
            she.

                          YOUSHO
            <calm>  She lives in the house at
            the bottom of the steps of this
            shrine.

KIYONNE drops YOUSHO and sits back and just stares for a second.  Then
she starts to cry.

                          KIYONNE
            Noooo!!! It's all gone, my peace
            and quiet, my success, my life. It's
            all ruined, all GONE!

YOUSHO sweatdrops.

Cut to subspace, WASHUU's Lab.  A large multicolored floor stretches
into a large room with walls that go beyond the camera.  WASHUU is
sitting on a floating pillow typing on her holographic keyboard. The
outline of a door appears then fills in yellow with a window as ADAM
pushes it open and walks into the Lab.  He walks over to her with his
hands in his pockets.

                           ADAM
            Washuu.

                          WASHUU
            Adam.

                           ADAM
            <beat> You called?

WASHUU turns in her pillow and looks up at ADAM.

                          WASHUU
            Your work on the subspace inverter
            assembly is incomplete.  I was hoping
            you could finish it. <beat> Now.

                           ADAM
            <blinks> Of... of course, Washuu.  I
            just need to review the schematics for
            reference.

                          WASHUU
            <flat> Proceed.

WASHUU turns back around and continues typing on her computer.  ADAM
reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ring which he puts on his
index finger.  As he raises his hands another holographic keyboard
appears and he begins typing on it.

                           ADAM
            Are you okay, Washuu?  You see a bit--

                          WASHUU
            I'm fine.

                           ADAM
            <quick; quizzical> How old are you?

WASHUU stops for a moment, she is visibly pained for a second before
returning to her typing.

                          WASHUU
            I'm old. <beat> Much older than you'll
            ever be.

                           ADAM
            Oh, of course.  The many years you spent
            as Kagato's prisoner are probably much
            longer than I'll ever live.  But you have
            information that you've dated as thousands
            of years old.

                          WASHUU
            <angered> *Very* old.  Happy?

                           ADAM
            You aren't like the rest of the people here.
            You're not Juraian, not like Mihoshi, and I
            don't think you're like Kagato --

                          WASHUU
            I am NOTHING like Kagato. In age, or species.

                           ADAM
            Then how old are you... WHAT are you?

She seems to think about it for a long time before answering.

                          WASHUU
            I'm Washuu.

                           ADAM
            Then what does that mean?

WASHUU doesn't move for several moments.

                           ADAM
            What do you know about Pluto?

                          WASHUU
            It's a planet.

ADAM looks at her with his eyebrows raised.

                          WASHUU
            Oh, *HER*. <beat> You know I did detect
            her... TAINT on you, but I assumed it was
            a malfunction. I really didn't think she'd
            do it.

                           ADAM
            Do what?

                          WASHUU
            Produce a child.

                           ADAM
            Prod... <enraged> WHAT?!

Cut to the exterior of the Masaki household.  The snow is still
Falling heavily and a thick layer of it covers almost everything.  A
Pair of figures walk up to the house and enter.

Cut to interior, Mihoshi is watching television on the couch laughing
hysterically.  YOUSHO walks in from the hall wearing a hood and cloak
that makes him look a lot like Obi-Wan Kenobi.  KIYONNE walks in 
behind him and cringes when she see's MIHOSHI.

                          YOUSHO
            Mihoshi! There's someone here to see
            you.

                          MIHOSHI
            Who? <beat; yelling> KIYONNE!!

MIHOSHI jumps off the couch and runs over to grab KIYONNE.  She holds
her close and shakes her back and forth.

                          MIHOSHI
            Oh Kiyonne! I missed you soooo much!
            I thought I'd never see you again I
            was stranded here without my ship an
            I lost my hypercube and...

                          KIYONNE
            Mihoshi! Shut UP! <beat; softer> I'm
            almost afraid to ask. <normal> Mihoshi
            did YOU have anything to do with the
            debris of Kagato's ship?

                          MIHOSHI
            Yes! <beat;very quick> Oh, Kiyonne it 
            was so scary, we were on the ship and 
            all these big faces were attacking me
            and then I was alone and big snakes
            were after me and then Washuu broke
            out of this crystal and destroyed the
            the snakes but we were trapped an..

                           YOUSHO
            <softly to KIYONNE> How much longer
            will she go on like this?

                           KIYONNE
            Until she's told us every little detail
            from the event, and believe me, she
            remembers EVERY detail.

                           MIHOSHI
            So then she made Aeka come over to the
            reverse side and then he was gonna 
            destroy the Earth but Tenchi and Adam
            showed up to stop him and...

KIYONNE, who looks like she's gonna have an aneurysm, yells into
MIHOSHI'S ear causing her to fall backwards.

                           KIYONNE
            MIHOSHI! SHUT UP!!

                           MIHOSHI
            Well, I'm so glad my best partner is
            back! We can be a team again, Kiyonne!
            We were the best!

                           KIYONNE
            <softly> Why couldn't you just stay dead?

Cut to Subspace, Washuu's lab.  ADAM and WASHUU as still just where
we left them last except for the large vein bulging from ADAM'S head.

                            ADAM
            Her child?! <beat> Absolutely not! I'm
            not.. I *CAN'T* be related to her.
            Hell, I don't even know what she IS.
            My mother was a magnificent person, she
            died when I was a kid, but I KNEW HER.

                           WASHUU
            Just the same, her presence almost
            emanates from you.

                            ADAM
            I tell you, she is NOT my mother.
 
                           WASHUU
            Well, it would be awfully strange for
            her to break the rules, she must be
            the strictest one of us all about rules.
            <beat> How do you know her exactly?

                            ADAM
            I *don't*. <beat> I've been hearing her
            voice recently, but she doesn't tell me
            anything about her, just about some goal
            I'm supposed to fulfill.  And I met her
            on the Souja with Tsunami, she said that
            I agreed to do work for her a long time
            ago, then she showed me a scene I don't
            even remember from my youth. <beat;soft>
            it was just after my mother died too.

                           WASHUU
            Hmm, very interesting. I'll have to do
            additional tests, you could me more
            interesting than you first appeared to
            be.

                            ADAM
            So what is Pluto and why is she picking
            on me?

                           WASHUU
            Pluto, <beat> is a planet.

WASHUU smiles evilly as ADAM looks at her scornfully just as the door
appears again and AEKA walks in.

                           AEKA
            <calling> Oh Washuu!

ADAM keeps staring at WASHUU, who returns to her typing.  AEKA walks
over to WASHUU and ADAM.

                          WASHUU
            What do you want?

                           AEKA
            Washuu, I was wondering if you had
            something I could plant Ryo-oh's seed
            in that will be like it was on Jurai.

                          WASHUU
            Of course I do.

There's a short moment of silience.

                           ADAM
            <laughing> Will you get Aeka the device
            for Ryo-oh's seed?

                          WASHUU
            Oh, okay.


Cut to dining room of the Masaki house, a large table with KIYONNE,
MIHOSHI, YOUSHO, and TENCHI kneeling around it.

                          TENCHI
            So you're Mihoshi's partner?  I suppose
            you're glad you've found her, she's 
            been very upset about being stranded
            here on Earth.

                          KIYONNE
            <flat> Yes, I'm so glad.

                          MIHOSHI
            Kiyonne and I were the best Galaxy Police
            Officers, first class, number one, the
            top of our--

                          KIYONNE
            I think they get the POINT Mihoshi.
            <beat> Actually, I was on the way to
            becoming sector chief when the
            commissioner's wonderful granddaughter
            was assigned to be the partner of the
            best officer in the GP.  Me.  So now
            I'm a patrol officer, but I suppose I
            should be grateful to have such a
            caring partner as opposed to the
            hundreds of officers I WOULD have had,
            all under my command to keep an entire
            sector in order instead of a small
            patrol.  But, I guess it was fate.

KIYONNE is visibly depressed by that statement.

                           YOUSHO
            So what are you going to do now that
            you've found Mihoshi?

                           KIYONNE
            Well, I've got to take her back to GP
            Headquarters so she can testify as to
            the destruction of her ship and so she
            can deliver her report on the death of
            Kagato.

                           MIHOSHI
            Ooohhh, but Kiyonne, I want us to stay 
            here, on Earth.

                           KIYONNE
            We can't, we have to go to HQ to get
            our assignment.

                           MIHOSHI
            But, but Kiyonne, everyone is here. We
            can't leave them. We can't, we can't we
            can't!

                           KIYONNE
            Mihoshi! Just be quiet! You don't have a
            choice!

AEKA walks in from WASHUU'S door, followed by ADAM.  At the same
time, SASAMI and RYO-OHKI come inside from the cold snow.  She
shakes off her clothes and takes off her boots before noticing
KIYONNE.

                           SASAMI
            Oh, hello.

                           TENCHI
            Oh, this is Kiyonne, she's Mihoshi's
            partner from the Galaxy Police. <beat>
            Kiyonne, this is Princess Sasami,
            Princess Aeka, and Adam.

ADAM waves meekly.  AEKA gives a slight bow and SASAMI waves her hand
cheerily.

                           SASAMI
            Hi!

                            AEKA
            It's a pleasure to meet you.

                            ADAM
            Uh, Yo.

KIYONNE starts to wave then stops and freezes.

                           KIYONNE
            Wait! You mean THE Princesses to the
            throne of the House of Jurai? <beat>
            And they were here, all along with,
            <turns> YOU?

MIHOSHI smiles innocently.  Suddenly RYOUKO appears in the rafters
and flies down and smothers TENCHI.  AEKA quickly turns red.

                           RYOUKO
            Oh Tenchi! Please, please, PLEASE,
            make the snow stop. I hate the cold
            weather!

                          KIYONNE
            <stands; louder> AND the Space Pirate
            Ryouko? Attacker of Jurai 700 years
            Ago? <beat> In the SAME HOUSE? <beat>
            With YOU? <beat; yelling> AND NO ONE
            SEE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS?

Everyone looks at KIYONNE and shakes their heads slowly.  She slumps
down onto the floor and sighs. ADAM walks over to her and places a
hand on her shoulder.  AEKA rushes over to TENCHI and pulls RYOUKO
away from him.

                            ADAM
            You've got to find a way to get rid of
            stress.  This raving and yelling like a
            lunatic is very unbecoming.

                           RYOUKO
            <yelling> Let me be Princess!

                            AEKA
            <yelling> You get your hands off of
            Tenchi!

                           RYOUKO
            I'll do what I want Princess and you'll
            not stop me. 

                            AEKA
            If you don't let go of him I'll be forced
            to make you let go.

                           RYOUKO
            Oh yeah? You and what army?

The bickering between the two continues in the background

                            ADAM
            <sighs> Of course, around here, it's
            almost normal.

Cut to Masaki house exterior, a man in a trench coat is walking up to
the house.  Fade to interior as NOBUYUKI walks into the house with a
briefcase in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other.  As he's
taking his shoes off, TENCHI walks into the foyer.

                           TENCHI
            Oh, hey dad!  I thought I heard you come
            in.

NOBUYUKI quickly hides the flowers behind his back.  He smiles
nervously.

                          NOBUYUKI
            Yeah, just got back from the office. I
            had to work on a house design that has
            to be done in a couple of days.

                           TENCHI
            Even today? In this weather?

                          NOBUYUKI
            Well, some people think I don't have a
            personal life, they insist that I get
            these things done in such a short time.
            I've designed 6 houses this month alone!

YOUSHO sticks his head into the foyer behind TENCHI.

                           YOUSHO
            Ahhh, Nobuyuki.  Going to drink some sake
            with me tonight?

NOBUYUKI stands holding the briefcase in front of the flowers and 
Starts walking up the stairs.

                          NOBUYUKI
            Uhh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
            I've got to go put this in my room now,
            bye.

TENCHI and YOUSHO watch NOBUYUKI smile nervously as he rushes up the
stairs holding his briefcase in front of him.

                           TENCHI
            What's wrong with him?

                           YOUSHO
            The mind goes quick for those who don't
            use it properly.

YOUSHO ducks back away from the foyer. TENCHI turns around and stares
into the doorway strangely.

                           TENCHI
            And what's that supposed to mean?

Cut to subspace, Washuu's Lab.  ADAM and WASHUU are both typing
furiously on holographic keyboards.  It's dark all around them,
the sounds of machines clicking and popping can be heard in the
background.  Simultaneously they turn around and grin.  Pan around
them to show the large machine that is in front of them.

                           WASHUU
            It's almost finished! <laughs>

                            ADAM
            It just needs to be tuned to the right
            frequency and tested. <beat> Which, of
            course could take a while.

                           WASHUU
            It's simple! For a genius like me!

                        MIHOSHI (O.S.)
            So what does it do?

                           WASHUU
            Well, it takes what you've always
            desired and...

ADAM and WASHUU quickly stare at each other then slowly turn to face
MIHOSHI who's smiling behind them.  WASHUU jumps behind ADAM and
sticks her head out from behind him.

                           WASHUU
             AHHH!! How'd you get in here!?

                           MIHOSHI
             I used the door.

                            ADAM
             <slowly> You used the door?

                           WASHUU
             You can't use the door to get in here.
             You have to go through subspace first!

MIHOSHI looks like she's confused beyond her brain power. Washuu
steps out from behind ADAM and looks at MIHOSHI.

                           WASHUU
             So what do you want?

                           MIHOSHI
             I just wanted to know what you were
             working on in here.

                            ADAM
             <quickly> You wouldn't understand it.

WASHUU and ADAM look at each other and smile for a second.

                           WASHUU
            So get ooooout!  You'll ruin something
            in here!

They turn back to see MIHOSHI is no longer standing there and has
moved over to the machine.

                          MIHOSHI
            So what does this do?

MIHOSHI presses a button and the panel explodes with wires and
circuitry.  ADAM and WASHUU dash over to her.

                           WASHUU
            NO! Don't touch anything!!

                            ADAM
            MIHOSHI, STOP!!

ADAM pulls MIHOSHI from the panel as a few others explode in a flash
of light.  WASHUU puts her hands to her head and pull on her hair 
then turns to look at MIHOSHI.  ADAM quickly begins pressing buttons
on the console and looking at the circuitry. 

                           WASHUU
            Mihoshi! What did you do? Don't touch
            ANYTHING when you're in here!

                           MIHOSHI
            Sorr--

                            ADAM
            Shit!

                           WASHUU
            What?

                            ADAM
            The entire sub-matrix is trashed!  Not
            to mention the controls for the 
            dimensional analyzer and conformer.
            I'll take me a day to rebuild all this
            damage.

                           WASHUU
            Nooo! My machine! Mihoshi! Get ou--
            <beat> Mihoshi?

WASHUU and ADAM look around but Mihoshi isn't around.  They look at
each other in confusion.

Cut to Masaki household interior, living room.  YOUSHO and NOBUYUKI
are sitting on the couch drinking sake.  They are watching the snow
Fall through the sliding glass door which is currently open.  A
Really thick layer of snow covers the nighttime landscape.

                             YOUSHO
            A lot has happened these last few days,
            Nobuyuki.
 
                            NOBUYUKI
            Yes, a lot grandpa.

                             YOUSHO
            You know, even though you aren't my son,
            you're a lot like me.

                            NOBUYUKI
            Yes, I've noticed that. <beat> I used to
            be a lot like her as well.

                             YOUSHO
            Yes, my daughter was a lot like you.  I
            Think she loved you because of it.

                            NOBUYUKI
            <soft> Achika.

NOBUYUKI gets up from the couch and walks out onto the porch and 
holds his cup of sake out in the snow.  Several flakes fall into
it.

                            NOBUYUKI
            She loved the snow. <beat> I hated it.

YOUSHO gets up to stand next to NOBUYUKI, he also holds out his sake.

                             YOUSHO
            I never understood how she could love
            the snow so much when I hated it. <beat>
            but you know, I don't hate it anymore.

                            NOBUYUKI
            I don't hate it anymore either.  When I
            got up this morning and saw it, I could
            only think of how beautiful she looked
            in the snow.  How much she loved it, how
            much it pained me to see her...

NOBUYUKI drinks the rest of his sake and looks down at the ground.

                             YOUSHO
            It was just like today that it happened.
            The snow came down furiously, but she
            kept smiling.  <beat>  Nobuyuki?

Cut to NOBUYUKI, still with his head down.  Pan downwards to show the
empty cup of sake he's holding in his hand.  A teardrop falls into
the cup and settles in the center.  Shortly after, a snowflake joins
it, mixing with it until the snowflake is gone.

                            NOBUYUKI
            <strained> She smiled till the end. She
            said to me, 'Time is short, but I lived
            my life to the fullest, that's all that
            really matters.'

                             YOUSHO
            She always used to say that.  From the
            first day you two started going out
            regularly.  I used to think it was
            that sparkle of joy she had when she
            was with you talking.  But...

YOUSHO drinks the rest of his sake and turns around to go in the
House.  NOBUYUKI looks up at the snow, his eyes are slightly wet.  He
turns and follows YOUSHO back inside closing the door behind him. Pan
left to see ADAM, standing beside the house, holding a mess of 
wires and machinery, his eyes are wide and he looks a bit shaken. The
top of his head is covered in snow.

                              ADAM
            <whispered> Tenchi's mother...

                          PLUTO (O.S.)
            She died from a massive immune system
            shut down, in this house, on November
            tenth, 1985.

ADAM spins on his foot to see PLUTO standing in her sailor fuku,
holding onto her staff.  Strangely, none of the snow seems to be
falling on her.

                              PLUTO
            For all intense purposes, she died
            from what seemed like, old age.  She
            was thirty-two.

                              ADAM
            What really happened to her?

                              PLUTO
            She spend all of her energy when she 
            was in her teens.  She had none left
            to continue living.

                              ADAM
            <slowly> All her energy. <beat> How?

                              PLUTO
            You'll find out.

                              ADAM
            Great. <beat; annoyed> So why are you
            here now?  Come to give me more cryptic
            information that won't be useful until
            it's too late?

                              PLUTO
            I know what you and Washuu are building.
            Do not continue.

                              ADAM
            Why?

                              PLUTO
            The very fabric of the space time
            continuum relies on the fact that only
            those who fully understand it, may
            manipulate it.  Washuu would know that
            if...

                              ADAM
            Don't trail off like that!  Why doesn't
            she know? And why does she think that
            I'm your son?

                              PLUTO
            Modifications were necessary.  Side
            effects can be mistaken for genetic
            similarities.

                              ADAM
            Modifications?! What do you mean?

PLUTO waits a moment then turns and waves her staff until a large
portal appears.

                              ADAM
            Don't you dare ignore me! What am I to
            You? Your puppet?

                              PLUTO
            You are my messenger. <beat> It's what
            you agreed to be.

PLUTO steps into the portal.

                              ADAM
            <yelling> Why don't I remember then?!

The portal closes with Pluto inside.  ADAM blinks a few times then
shakes his head so all the snow falls from the top.

                              ADAM
            Why am I always the one who doesn't
            know what's going on?


Cut to space, interior of the Yagami.  KIYONNE and MIHOSHI are 
sitting in the cockpit of the ship as it orbits the earth.  They are
both wearing their GP uniforms.

                             KIYONNE
            Yukinojo, open Hyperlink-Comm to GP
            headquarters.

YUKINOJO descends from the top bubble and stops right in front of 
KIYONNE.

                            FUKINOJO
            Hypercomm active.  Vocal password 
            Identification requested.

                             KIYONNE
            'She had so many children, she knew
            not what to do.'

                            FUKINOJO
            Password confirmed.  Hypercomm open.

                            KIYONNE
            Good. Transmit Mihoshi's report.

Suddenly a big screen appears, floating in mid air.  The GP SECTION
CHIEF is on it.

                            CHIEF
            Good job Kiyonne! Oh, I see you are
            Both there! That's great.

                            KIYONNE
            Why is that great?

                             CHIEF
            Twelve hours ago, the Galaxy Police
            battleship Shunga was stolen and is
            reported to be heading in that direction
            of the galaxy.  I want you two to remain
            there incase the ship does come to the
            Sol System.

                            KIYONNE
            Wha? <beat> WHY? This is a backwater
            planet in the middle of nowhere! We
            don't even have direct jurisdiction
            over this area of space!  It's a protected
            region by the House of Jurai!

                             CHIEF
            We've already gotten permission from
            Jurai.  They agree that the Shunga should
            be recovered and any way that might be
            achieved should be used.

                            MIHOSHI
            Yea! Now we don't have to leave Kiyonne!
            We can stay with Tenchi and Sasami and Aeka
            And Adam and Yousho and Ryouko and...

MIHOSHI keeps rattling off the names of the people who live in the
Masaki household while KIYONNE keeps talking to the CHIEF.

                            KIYONNE
            Are you sure we have to stay here?

                             CHIEF
            Oh I'm positive.  By the way, what's in
            this report?

                            KIYONNE
            The standard Mihoshi-style report.  It
            contains the events leading up to and
            the actual death of Kagato.

                             CHIEF
            SHE was reponsable?

                            KIYONNE
            Not directly.  From what I glimpsed at
            the report, Tenchi and Adam did most of
            the work.

                             CHIEF
            Whatever.  You better get going.  I'll
            Make sure this report gets sent to Jurai
            as well. They've been probably waiting for a
            conclusion to this for a long time. Section
            Chief, Out.

The screen disintegrates into nothingness.  KIYONNE turns to MIHOSHI,
who's still talking to herself.

                           KIYONNE
            <frustrated> MIHOSHI! He's gone!

                           MIHOSHI
            <confused> What?

KIYONNE hits her forehead with her hand.

Cut to Subspace, Washuu's lab.  Everyone is gathered in the darkness:
TENCHI, RYOUKO, AEKA, SASAMI, YOUSHO, NOBUYUKI, KIYONNE, and MIHOSHI.
They are all looking around, a bit confused.

                          WASHUU (O.S.)
            And now, I'd like to present to you, my
            <soft> second <normal> greatest creation
            of all time!

                           ADAM (O.S.)
            Ever wish things had gone a bit different?
            Ever wish that you could go back and
            change a few things?  Ever wish you could
            have lived in a time and place where you
            were a ancient Samurai warrior, or a space
            faring explorer?  Well, wish no longer!

                          WASHUU (O.S.)
            Introducing the Multidimensional Time And
            Space Manipulator!

Lights suddenly come on and we see WASHUU and ADAM standing beside 
the large machine from earlier.  A few repairs can be seen from where
MIHOSHI had destroyed things, but otherwise the thing looks sleek
and new.

                             ALL
            Oooooohhh!

                             WASHUU
            My Time and Space Manipulator will create
            a world to your design.  Just tell it
            what you want and it will make it for you.
            No work, no regrets, just perfection! And
            It's all brought to you by the genius of
            WASHUU!!

Everyone looks at the machine in awe, then, with hunger.

                             RYOUKO
            Ooh! Let me try first!

                              AEKA
            No, Let me!

                             SASAMI
            Oh, I want to give it a try!

                            MIHOSHI
            Let me have a go at it!

WASHUU suddenly stand in front of them all.

                             WASHUU
            NO!! <beat> No one gets to touch it
            until it's fine tuned.  And definitely
            not without proper supervision by
            myself!

                              ALL
            Awwww.

                           RYOUKO (V.O.)
            That's okay. I'll just wait unit you're
            asleep. Then I'll get MY go at it, heh
            Heh haa!

                            AEKA (V.O.)
            I'll do it at night.  Then I'll erase
            That dreaded Ryouko from the entire
            universe and Tenchi will be all to myself.
            Oh, Hohohohohohohoh.

                          SASAMI (V.O.)
            I wonder what it would be like to be a
            Superhero like in those TV shows.  Maybe
            I'll just look at it when everyone has
            gone to sleep.
 
                          MIHOSHI (V.O.)
            Ooh! I want to create a world where
            Kiyonne and I are together forever and
            We'll always be happy!

                          KIYONNE (V.O.)
            I need to create a world where Mihoshi
            never existed.  If only to experience 
            that for a while.

                          WASHUU (V.O.)
