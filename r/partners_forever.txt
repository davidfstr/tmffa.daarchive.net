        I walked out of my office slowly, contemplating what I
was about to do.
        Did I really want to do this?
        I looked at the sign on my door.
        'Chief Inspector Kiyone Makibi'
        Yes. I REALLY wanted to do this.
        Once upon a time, I would have given anything, ANYTHING,
to be where I am today. I would have thrown myself into my
work and forgotten that anything else existed, until I got
a promotion.
        That was so long ago. I looked down at the letter in
my hands now, and took a deep breathe.
        I walked down the hall quickly, and knocked on the door
of my superiors.
        "Enter." He said.
        I didn't want to give myself a chance to chicken out, so
I quickly opened the door and stepped in.
        He was surprised to see me. "Kiyone! What can I do for
you?"
        "Sir... I..." I couldn't find the right words in my mouth.
So, I simply handed him my letter.
        He read it over carefully, and frowned. He looked up at
me, and crossed his arms. "Are you sure about this?" He asked
seriously.
        I licked my dry lips and nodded. "Yes sir. I'm sure."
        "What's wrong? Is someone giving you a hard time?" He
asked.
        I quickly shook my head. "No sir. It's not that... it's
just..." I took another deep breathe. "In the past... I loved my
job. My job was my life. But I wanted recognition. I wanted to be
on top. It wasn't enough that I loved my job, and I recognized my
own hard work... I wanted other people to recognize me. So, I
wanted to get promoted.  I worked my butt off to get promoted."
        "I see," My superior said. "You want another promotion,
don't you?" He raised his eyebrows in thought. "Very well. You
have been the Chief Inspector for a good ten years now. You
work hard and you have a good record. I don't see why no-"
        Oh GOD no. Another promotion was the LAST thing I wanted.
        "No sir," I quickly corrected him. He looked at me, confused.
I gave a quick smile. "What I was wanting to say, sir, is that
I want a... demotion."
        My superior stared at me. "What?"
        "You see, ten years ago," I began, "I was a First Class
Detective. I was happy then. I loved the adrenaline rush and the
thrill of the chase. When I got promoted, I got shoved behind a
desk. I... I thought that if I stuck with it, I would get used to
it, but... but sir, I can't stand this anymore. I want to go back
to being a First Class Detective."
        He looked at me, and I think he saw the desperation in my
eyes. He gave a sigh. "Very well, Kiyone. I'll see what I can
do."
        I broke into a smile. "Thank you sir."

*****************************************************************

        Now THIS was the life. I felt my sweat on my face. The
pounding in my heart was deafening. My hands grasped my gun
tightly.
        I LOVED this.
        I looked back to my partner- Yuri Gato. She was a rookie,
but she was very, very good. We had been paired for only a week
and she had done nothing wrong.
        She was very different from Mihoshi Kuramitsu. She was
as calm as Mihoshi was excitable. She was as steady as Mihoshi
was shaky. She was as responsible as Mihoshi was a flake. She
was every partner's dream come true.
        But for some reason... I found that I couldn't stand
her. Yuri was a very nice person, and she was very respectful
towards me... but for some reason, I found myself yearning to
have her mutate into Mihoshi.
        The crook we were tracking down suddenly made a run for
it from behind some crates.
        I nodded to Yuri, who nodded back. We both moved in
opposite directions. I heard the crook run towards her.
        I ran behind a row of crates, looking up every once in
a while. The crook was very predictable. Everything was going
according to plan. Nothing much happened the next few minutes, and
the adrenaline faded.
        I found myself hoping that Yuri would klutz out. I prayed
that she'd trip over a shoelace or something, and fall flat on
her face. I hoped that the crook was do something different,
sporadic. I prayed that my plan would go all to hell, so then I
could think on my feet.
        Then, I blinked. I couldn't believe what I was thinking.
I ordered myself to snap out of it.
        "FREEZE!!" I heard Yuri shout.
        I looked out, and saw that she was standing, pointing her
gun at the crook. The crook had dropped his weapon, and was now
blubbering in fear.
        I felt disgusted at myself as my hopes drained away and I
ran out to the crook, forced him onto the floor, and cuffed him.
        A few moments later, backup had arrived, taken the crook
away, and I was left with Yuri.
        We were both sitting on crates, and were both silent. I
knew she wanted me to say something. I knew she wanted me to
give her a sign of approval. She always does this after every
assignment, but I never say anything to her. I didn't want to
deal with a cocky rookie. But this time, I'm going to say something
to her. She deserved it.
        Turning, I looked into her eyes and smiled. "That was
wonderful," I told the rookie. "You did a good job."
        "Y-You mean it?" She asked.
        I nodded. "Yeah. You handed the situation carefully, you
obeyed my instructions and you didn't screw up. You did wonderful."
        Yuri smiled grandly, and suddenly, tears started fall from
her eyes.
        I raised my eyebrows. What the hell?! What was she crying
about. It took me a moment to realize that they were tears of
joy.
        "Y-you have no i-idea," she said. "I... I was so worried..."
        I blinked at her. "Why were you worried?"
        "I wasn't prepared," she blurted out. "My first partnership
was a disaster... we... we couldn't do anything right. When I
learned I was going to be reassigned and partnered with you.. I
freaked. I was so afraid I'd screw up. That was all I could do
with my first partner. She... she was a nightmare."
        I smiled sympathetically at her and pat her back. "Come on.
She couldn't have been that bad."
        Yuri shook her head. "You don't understand. I was a
struggling student in the academy. I barely passed. The superiors,
do you know what they do with people like me? They partnered me
with the worst partner in the universe, the 'nightmare' as we call
her, to 'discourage' me from continuing on with my rookie year."
        At this point, Yuri swallowed and there was a proud smile
on her face. "All bad students go to the 'nightmare'. I survived my
month with her... I was so happy when the next student came to take
my place. I made it... I survived my month with her and I... I
made it!!"
        I frowned. I didn't know that the academy did that. That
was just cruel... to the rookie AND to the officer. If they partnered
them up for only a month, then by the time the two finally get to
bond, they would be split up. It was like being dumped on a
regular basis.
        I wondered who the 'nightmare' could be. "What was her
name?" I asked Yuri.
        "Kuramitsu. Mihoshi Kuramitsu." She said softly.
        I froze.

*****************************************************************

        I used to like the night. It brought rest and sleep, and
shelter from Mihoshi's klutz attacks. But tonight, I am plagued
with dreams. In the past, dreams of demotion, eternity with
Mihoshi and never excelling were my demons. Tonight, my demon is
100 times worst than Ryoko. Tonight, guilt plagued me.
        I had been so happy when I was first promoted, that I
didn't even remember to check on Mihoshi after I left. There had
been a terrible goodbye. When I had first told her that I was
leaving, and she was not, it had taken almost 24 hours to pry
her fingers out of my thigh. I had ended up sneaking away during
the middle of the night. I only called her after I was back at
head quarters, and that had not been pretty either. I hadn't
called her since.
        I looked up at a database today, to find if what Yuri
said had been true. It had been. A looong list of names had
appeared beside Mihoshi's under the 'partner' column.
        Mihoshi is the most trusting, gentle person in the
universe. It only takes her a little while, maybe a month, to
completely understand her partner as well as she ever will.
When she finally does, then she trusts them completely. Then,
to have them ripped away from her and be replaced by a
complete stranger... all that emotional investment, completely
wasted...
        The worst part is, Mihoshi never learns. She'll never
see the pattern. She'll always keep getting hurt, and the pain
will never be dulled for her.
        The past 10 years must have been hell.
        Oh god, what have I done to her? I have to make this
up to her somehow, even if it means...

*****************************************************************

        The other's thought I'd gone insane. First, I asked
for a demotion, then I asked for THIS.
        I sat in the captain's chair of a small ship, watching
the stars rush by me, like diamonds being thrown through the night
as I travel to my destiny.
        If this had been 10 years ago, I would be kicking and
screaming every inch of the way.
        The trip was all too fast, because soon, the most ugly,
dirty, rundown spaceship in the universe came into my sight.
        Tears of joy sprung to my eyes.
        It was the Yagami. I didn't know I missed it so much.
        Hands shaking, I tune my ship to the correct frequency
to hail the Yagami. I waited a full 10 minutes, but no one
answered.
        I frowned. Mihoshi wasn't on board. I managed to access
the Yagami's commands and opened a door. I guided my ship expertly
through the door, and landed it in the Yagami's docking bay.
        The place was a mess. Food crumbs and used clothing was
everywhere. Everything was the same. Nothing had changed.
        Getting out of my ship, I looked around, and my mind's
eye was invaded by memories.
        Over there would be the private chambers, over there
was the dining area (not that Mihoshi ever realized this. She
ate anywhere and everywhere the craving for munches seized her)
and over here was where Tenchi's house was during that episode
with Kagato.
        Tenchi! When I left them, he was about 18. He must be
about 28 now. I wondered if he had chosen Ryoko or Aeyka.
        Walking through the entire ship, I couldn't find any
trace of Mihoshi. I walked into the bridge and looked at the
systems.
        Smiling, I sat in my old chair and twirled around once.
Then, I leaned over the controls.
        It was all coming back to me now. Everything was so
familiar. Mihoshi hadn't changed anything.
        Suddenly, a warning light came on. I blinked. That was
new.
        A screen suddenly came to life infront of me.
        "Who's there?!" The girl in the screen cried. She was
beautiful in a very classic way and had blue hair and pink eyes.
I placed her at about 22 years of age. Even though she seemed
upset and she was on a computer screen, an aura of peace and
calm radiated from her.
        I blinked. "Sasami?" I asked. Wow. The little tyke had
really changed.
        Sasami blinked too. "Kiyone?"
        "Yes."
        Sasami blinked again. Her entire face lit up. Her eye
brows lifted in amazement and her eyes went wide. Her mouth opened
in awe, and suddenly, she looked a lot more like the cheerful,
amazed girl I remembered her as.
        "Oh my god, Kiyone, it IS you!" She launched into a fast
and excited greeting, that filled me up with happiness.
        "You have to come down!" Sasami said, "You have to see
everyone! Tenchi 'n Aeyka 'n Ryoko..."
        Hmm... those three. Suddenly, I'm not so sure I wanted
to go down there.
        "... 'n... Mihoshi." Suddenly, Sasami's face fell and her
voice slowed.
        "Oh my, Mihoshi. She'll be so-"
        And suddenly, I couldn't wait to go down. "Mihoshi, how
is she??" I ask, with more emotion than I wanted.
        "Um... I think you should come down," Sasami said softly.
        My heart almost stopped. Something happened to Mihoshi?
        "I'll be right down," I swore.

*****************************************************************

        I was sweating profoundly when I knocked on the Masaki's
front door. When Sasami opened the door, and promptly threw her
arms around me in a hug, I had been considerably relaxed.
        We sat at the dinner table and talked about the last
ten years. I told her what had happened with me, and she told
me what happened with her. Sasami had really changed. She was all
grown up now, but she was still bubbly and cheerful. I asked her
if anyone else had changed and she shrugged.
        "I don't think so," Sasami said. "Tenchi's still nice,
kind and cool. Aeyka's still Aeyka. Ryoko is still Ryoko. They're
still both after Tenchi. Washuu's still plotting universe
domination."
        "And Mihoshi?" I asked. My heart was pounding in my
ears. Please let me be wrong. Please let me be wrong. Please
tell me she hasn't changed, and she hasn't been hurt.
        Sasami was thoughtful. "She was really hurt," Sasami
said finally, confirming my worst fears. "Every month..."
Sasami shook her head. "Are you going to be her partner
again?" She suddenly asked hopefully. "And not just for a month?"
        I offered a weak smile. "For better or worse, 'til
death do we part."
        "Oh good," Sasami said. "You have no idea..."
        I suddenly had the urge to go see her. Sasami could see
my desire in my eyes plainly.
        "She still lives in that apartment you guys used to live
in. I think she's trying to clean up because she knows her new
partner is coming. I didn't tell she, it was you, 'cause I figured
you'd want to. Come back before dinner though, because I'm sure
everyone else wants to see you."
        I nodded. "Okay."

*****************************************************************

        I stared at the decimated apartment. It was a mess. I
wondered why anyone would still want to live here.
        I was shaking as I walked up to the apartment. Why hadn't
Mihoshi moved back in with the Masaki's? I would soon find out.
        I knocked nervously, hoping she was home.
        There was a lot of shuffling inside. I knew that Mihoshi
was trying to do some last minute cleaning, maybe to impress her
new partner to stay for more than a month. She really shouldn't
have worried.
        "C-coming," she cried.
        My heart did somersaults in my chest for the next few
moments, as I wondered if she'd hate me. It was my fault this
happened to her. I shouldn't have left the way I did. I shouldn't
have not called. I should have made sure she got a decent partner.
She has every right to hate my guts.
        Suddenly, Mihoshi flung open the door, just as I let my
guard down, managing to surprise me as usual.
        "Hi!!" She cried enthusiastically, hopefully.
        "Hi, Mihoshi," I said, smiling nervously. Please don't
hate me. Please don't hate me. "I'm your new partner, Kiyone
Makibi."
        Mihoshi stared at me. She didn't say a word. She started
shaking and tears rolled down her cheeks. Mihoshi always could
call tears to her eyes at will, but I just knew that these tears
were not Mihoshi-tears. These were more Ryoko-standard tears, and
Ryoko rarely cries.
        Did she hate me? I needed have worried.
        "I missed you so much!!" Mihoshi cried as she threw her
arms around me and hugged me in one of her bone crushing, air
supply cutting, pain inducing hugs.
        I don't recall ever feeling so loved or wanted before.
        Why did I ever want to leave?
