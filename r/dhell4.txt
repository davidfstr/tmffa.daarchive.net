The Darkest Hell 4 : Destruction of Jurai

	Yosho stood there and looked at the biomechanical horror.  The evil 
creatures eyes stared at him also, illuminating the area with their red 
glare.  Yosho squinted his eyes and prepared for combat.  Then, quicker than 
the blink of an eye, the biomechanical warrior flew through the air and 
attacked Yosho with a downward swipe.  The creatures aim was true, fast and 
hard; Yosho barely blocked it in time.  The creature, attacking faster than 
any enemy Yosho ever encountered before, tossed several well balanced and 
hard to dodge hits at Yosho.  After a few minutes, Yosho began to sweat, his 
body heat rising and forming a smoke around him in the chilled morning air.  
The creature didn't even seem to be breathing hard...

*************************************************************************************

	"FATHER!  NO!  PLEASE!"  Ayeka screamed as she watched the large 
reminisce of the Dark Juraian fleet go up in a blinding flash of light.  
Then, after the flash subsided, there only remained the broken pieces of the 
ships strong enough to nearly withstand that much power.  The entire area 
was encased in a shroud of silence.  Ayeka fell to her knees, sobbing.  
'First Tenchi, now Father... how much more of this must I endure?'  she 
thought to herself as she cried.  Ryo-oki let loose an empathetic "Meow" as 
they soared through open space, almost losing themselves in the large fleet 
of broken ships.  Ryoko was amazed at the amount of destruction that the 
fleet withstood.  They had won, yes, but at the cost of a great leader.  
Ryoko's thoughts began to wonder at how, now that the emperor was dead, many 
would strive to take his place.  One of them would be... would have been... 
Tenchi.  Ryoko shook her head to clear it of all those thoughts of... him.  
He was gone now, and there was nothing she could do, except make every last 
one of those Dark Juraian mother fuckers pay for what they have done.  And 
there would be plenty of time for that...

*************************************************************************************

	"YYYYyyyyyyeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh"  screamed Yosho as he dove in 
for a very powerful hit.  The creature blocked it with what seemed little 
difficulty.  'Damn, he's too strong.  How do I take out an enemy such as 
him?'  Yosho thought to himself.  Then a thought occurred to him, 
'Know your enemy.'

	"Who... are you?"  Yosho asked as he parried a very powerful, and 
painful, attack.

	"I am what has always been, and what shall always be.  Now, in my 
mortal form, I can do more than mere mind tricks."

	"You are the Demon that we defeated, then." Yosho said, squinting 
his eyes.

	"Yes.  And now my revenge is nearly complete.  You have destroyed 
everything dear to me, so I have done the same to you.  My work is almost 
complete, then this realm will be mine."

	"So you are a warrior of Tokimi's then?" Asked Yosho, trying to seem 
haughty.  

	"No.  Tokimi is nothing compared to me.  Now... you will die."

	The creature, without even giving any form of forewarning, faded 
into the air and reappeared behind Yosho.  If Yosho hadn't been so well 
trained, he would have died right then and there, but, using the swiftness 
only seven hundred years of training and self discipline, he turned around 
just in time to dodge a devastating attack that caused the earth underneath 
the warriors "Dark Hawk Sword" to break up and levitate.  Using the split 
second he had to counter attack, Yosho swiped forward, slicing the front of 
the warriors mask off.  The warrior then grasped his face, apparently in 
pain.  Slowly, the warrior removed his black, biomechanically gloved hand
away from his face.  Yosho saw the face under the mask and froze, petrified 
in pure shock and terror.  The creatures eyes glowed brighter as the mask 
slowly regenerated itself into its normal skull countenance.  Then the 
creature let loose a loud, vile laugh.  Yosho just stood there, 
not believing what he saw.  He saw a face that had haunted his recent 
nightmares, when he realized that they were not nightmares, but visions.  
The memories of his sleepless nights came back to him as he saw what was to 
become.

	"Good.  Now you see what has been done cannot be reversed.  Now, 
prepare to join your grandson  as a star in the sky."

	The evil warrior stabbed forward, but was blocked by a seriously 
pissed Yosho.  The warrior watched as Yosho's old features regenerated into 
that of a young man.  Still, the evil warrior did not flinch.  Suddenly, 
spurred with a newfound fighting spirit, Yosho attacked the warrior, 
determined to end it here and now.  Yosho began to release Jurai energy that 
had long remained dormant, and began to dissolve the ground around the evil 
warrior.  Chuckling slightly, the evil warrior leaped into the air and did 
several flips till he reached safe ground.  'Oh, no, this battles just 
getting started...' thought Yosho as he prepared for another attack...

*************************************************************************************

	"How long is it till we reach Jurai?" asked Funhao as they glided 
through outer space.

	"Only a few hours.  Why?"  asked Ryoko.

	"We need to prepare for the funeral ceremony.  The people of Jurai 
will not be pleased to hear their emperor has died."  Replied Funhao, 
as she struggled to hold back her sadness.  Curious, Ryoko looked behind her 
to see what has become of Misaki.  She saw her, giving Washu the biggest, 
tightest bear hug that she is possible of.  Washu was slowly becoming purple 
from the lack of oxygen.  Ryoko couldn't help but giggle a bit, that is, 
until she noticed that Misaki was weeping her royal heart out.  Speaking of 
her majesty, where was Ayeka?  

	"Ryo-oki.  Take over.  I'll be... right back."  Ryoko told the 
living spaceship.

	"Meow!"  was the response she got as she left the piloting area and 
wondered around the bridge.  Soon, she found her, sitting scrunched up in a 
hidden corner somewhere, looking like a broken china doll.  She slowly 
rocked back and forth, lightly smacking her head against Ryo-Oki's inner 
hull.  Ryoko couldn't help but feel sorry for her.  She held in her pride 
and sat next to the traumatized woman.  Ayeka didn't even acknowledge her 
existence.  

	"Ayeka... Ayeka, we need to talk."  Ryoko said quietly.

	There was no response.

	"Now come on Ayeka, don't give me the silent treatment.  Come on.  
I'm here, talk to me."

	Still, no response.

	"Listen, I know you've had a rough time of it, I have too, but you 
can't let them beat you.  What do you think Tenchi would say if he were here 
now?"

	Slowly, Ayeka turned her head and glared an Ryoko, making a face 
that, actually, scared her a bit.  Still Ryoko bit her lip and stayed there.  Ryoko but on her best 'humble' face and once again tried to get Ayeka to talk.  

	"Come on Ayeka, don't you think I hurt too?  I lost the most 
important think in the world to me.  Tenchi was all I had, and he died 
trying to save my life.  I saw it Ayeka, I saw him die.  Do you think that 
was EASY for me!?  Now, you're just going to sit here and cop a fit when the 
bastards that did this to us are still out there!?"

	Ayeka continued to glare at Ryoko, her face steadily becoming red.  
She began to grind her teeth.  

	"Say something to me, Ayeka."

	Finally, Ayeka began to talk.  "Fine, you want me to talk, 
I'll talk.  Fuck you."

	"What...?"

	"You heard me, Fuck you.  You haven't lost a FRACTION of the amount 
that I lost.  I had lost the only man whom I loved, AND my father.  My 
father was the Emperor of Jurai.  When he died, the throne of Jurai went up 
to those who could afford to get it.  He had no male heirs, and I am not 
married, so the throne goes up to the highest bidder.  I am NO LONGER of any 
importance to Jurai.  My entire LIFE has been for nothing.  And you have the 
nerve to tell me the YOU HAVE LOST EVERYTHING!?  You have lost nothing.  
You should count your blessings..."  said Ayeka said as she then turned her 
head away from Ryoko and never looked back at her.  Ryoko stared at Ayeka, 
aghast.  Without another word, Ryoko got up and walked back to the front of 
the ship.  Ayeka continued to stare out into the nothingness.  

*************************************************************************************

	The devastation was enormous as Yosho and the evil warrior continued 
to fight.  Buildings crumbled and people ran.  The evil warrior sliced right 
through the massive trees of Jurai, trying to topple them on top of the 
great warrior Yosho.  Yosho dodged them with ease.  Yosho continued to fight 
against the vile warrior, taking out an entire block of  Juraian homes.  
Luckily, most of the citizens of Jurai have retreated to safety by now.  The 
warrior continued to gaze at Yosho with his evil red eyes.  With a shout 
filled of rage, Yosho let loose a blast of Juraian energy that nearly ripped 
the entire left half of the palace apart.  Yosho's clothes were shredded and 
the warrior's body armor was busily trying to regenerate itself.  Both of 
their swords flickered weaker and weaker as their users got weaker and weaker.  
But they continued to fight, and the destruction became greater and greater...

*************************************************************************************

	The people all around him shouted and screamed as the warriors 
fought, destroying what was once a beautiful city, but Zeb didn't care.  He 
reveled in the glory of the greatness of Dark Jurai.  He sat and watched the 
destruction from afar, chuckling to himself.  And a large smile crossed his 
face as he realized that HE was responsible for this.  He was the one that 
summoned the dark forces and told them of the nefarious plan of Jurai to 
wipe them out of their dimension.  The Emperor was sure to make him a royal 
guard now.  Thoughts of glory and the hint of bloodlust in his veins made 
Zeb want to kill, but then he would be found out and destroyed, although 
death in the service of the Emperor was a privilege not bestowed to many.  A 
faint weeping broke him out of his thoughts of darkness.  He turned his head 
to see a little girl, crying as she looked out at the two warriors fighting.  
Her hair was a light blue, or Cyan, if you wanted to get technical.  She was 
tall for her age, but barely tall enough to see out the window.  
'I have seen her somewhere before...' thought Zeb.  Then, on his 
countenance, a vale of malignancy spread, once he realized who it was.  Zeb 
got off the chair he was sitting in, positioned perfectly to watch the 
battle, and walked over to the little girl.

	"Hello, little girl.  I say, you look mighty familiar.  What's your 
name?"  he said with pseudo-cheeriness. 

	"Oh, hello.  My names Sasami..." she said, wiping away the tears.

	That was all he needed to hear.  A large smile flushed upon his 
evil face.

*************************************************************************************

	The silence on the deck of Ryo-oki was penetrating.  No one even 
tried to talk to another person.  Ayeka still sat in her secluded corner, 
Ryoko still flew the ship, Misaki and Funhao stood there,  thinking, and 
Washu lightly taped on her computer, not necessarily doing anything, just 
keeping busy.  Without warning, the communication screen popped up, causing 
everyone to jump just a little.  A picture of Kiyonne showed up, slightly 
lifting the heaviness of the immediate area.

	"Yes, Kiyonne?  What is it?"  said Ryoko sullenly.  

	"We just got a communication from Jurai.  They're under attack!"

	"WHAT!?"  The group screamed in unison as they crammed together in 
front of the monitor.  A small sweat drop formed on Kiyonne's head.  

	"Ryo-oki!  Full speed ahead!  We've got to get to Jurai!"  Shouted 
Ayeka.  

	"MEOW!!" responded Ryo-oki as the group all fell to the ground as 
she sped faster.  Ryoko saw the other ships fly by at a fast rate until 
there was nothing but stars.  Then, next to Ryo-oki, flew the Yagami, then 
followed by several more ships until finally, the whole fleet was flying at 
warp speed.  

*************************************************************************************

	Yosho stood there, barely standing.  The warrior too showed fatigue 
as his Dark Hawk Sword began to fade into the air.  The warrior then heard 
something in the back of his head.  He turned his gaze away from Yosho.  
Taking this opportunity, Yosho ran forward at top speed, his sword ready to 
strike.  Then, as he swung, an incredible force knocked Yosho back, into 
some buildings that were mysteriously left standing, but not anymore.  
The Warrior Demon returned his gaze to the shocked and hurt Yosho.

	"They are here..." grinned the Warrior Demon.

	Unexpectedly, the entire planet of Jurai was surrounded by robed 
warriors.  Their hoods concealed their hideous biomechanical faces.  The 
Demon Warrior's eyes glowed bright red as he turned his back to Yosho.

	"Look around you Yosho.  Gaze upon the beautiful destruction you 
have wrought with your fury.  Look at how many lives were lost in your mad 
quest to destroy me."

	Yosho looked around and saw the utter devastation.  And he then knew 
that most of it was because of him, not because of the demon.  His face was 
a road map of sadness when this realization came to him.  

	"How many more must die so that I can be destroyed?  How many more 
worlds must be ravaged?  As long as you fight us, the death will continue, 
till you exist no more.  I will give you one chance, Yosho, the great 
warrior.  Embrace the darkness.  Join our ranks and rule countless 
universes.  Or, you can spend the rest of your natural life seeking us out, 
wasting your life in the futile attempt at wiping us all out.  The choice 
is yours..."  the demon continued.

	"The choice has already been made." Answered Yosho as he struggled 
to stand up.

	"Then so be it.  But, I'm afraid you cannot spare the energy to 
fight me more.  Unless you want her to die."

	"What...?!"  Yosho asked in a jolt.

	"Right now, one of us has the young half-god in his custody.  In 
mere minutes, she will find herself the victim of a most gruesome violation 
before she finally dies.  The choice is yours Yosho.  Either way...I win."

	"Sasami..." Yosho whispered under his breath.  He looked at the 
Warrior Demon, and then over to the space port, where everyone was running 
and packing up to leave.  He used his Jurai powers and looked at the 
building closer, gazing through the window as he saw Sasami, smiling 
brightly, leaving with a man who had a familiar glow in his eyes.  

	"NO!"  he yelled as he ran toward the building, his powers too 
exhausted to make him go any faster.  Behind him, he heard a loud, deep, 
roaring laughter that sounded too much like a roar, than laughter...

*************************************************************************************

	Ryo-oki flew faster and faster as they reached Juraian space.  On 
the monitors inside, the surviving members of the royal family, Washu, and 
Ryoko looked at the planet of Jurai.  Encircling the planet, moving around 
in various directions were several million little black dots.  They also saw 
a small fleet of Juraian transport ships.

	"They must be trying to evacuate..."  said Misaki as she stared into 
the monitor.

	Then, without any foresight, one of the indistinguishable black dots 
pasted over, or through, actually, one of the transport ships.  It detonated 
in a bright flash.  Everyone gasped at the same time.

	"Oh, my god!  All of those people!"  stated a dismayed Funhao.

	"Ryo-oki, enhance black dot on grid number 37047734, track it's 
movement too."

	"Meow" the space ship answered.

	A little green square appeared over one of the dots moving around 
the planet.  Then, every second, the picture got bigger and more focused, 
until finally, they saw what it was.  They gasped again when they saw the 
black robed figures hovering around the planet of Jurai.  Ryo-oki then 
pushed herself to the limit, going faster than she has ever had to before.

*************************************************************************************

	"Are you SURE you know where my mother is?"  asked Sasami innocently 
as she gazed up at Zeb, holding is small hand.  'He sure has beady eyes 
for a servant.'  Sasami observed to herself as they walked down the hallway, 
making way around the people scrambling to get onto the remaining transports.

	"Yes, for the FIFTH TIME, Yes!  I saw your mother's ship touch down.  
We have to go THIS WAY!"  he snapped.  'God DAMN this bitch is annoying!'  
Zeb observed silently to HIMSELF.  His mind did a mental 'Uh oh...' 
as he saw the little girl's face contort to fear and sadness.  'Shit, 
got to cover this up.'  Zeb thought.

	"I'm sorry Sasami.  Forgive me, your highness, I am just really 
stressed because of this current situation.  I throw myself at your mercy."  
Said Zeb in his most humblest manner.  Slowly, the annoying smile returned 
to Sasami's face.  'Great.  Now, just over here.'  Zeb thought as he 
pictured the Emperor giving him the highest honor one of his servants can 
receive, whatever it was.

	"SASAMI!"  a voice shouted as they began to turn the corner.  Sasami 
stopped for a brief second and looked at the running man trying to make his 
way through the heavy crowd.  His face was awfully familiar.  Then it 
occurred to her.

	"Brother Yosho?"  Sasami said quietly to herself as she was lightly 
jerked around the corner, out of Yosho's line of sight.  Yosho continued to 
push his way through the crowds of people, trying to find his little 
half-sister.  She was nowhere to be found.

*************************************************************************************

	"Wait, there's no one here."  Said Sasami innocently as they reached 
the Royal Juraian landing pad.  The place was deserted.  Sasami then heard a 
light chuckle.  It came from the man she had so blindly trusted.  She looked 
at him with hurt eyes as he turned his head and looked at her.  His eyes 
glowed a frightening red.

*************************************************************************************

	Yosho's head popped up as he heard a scream.  It was Sasami, the 
little girl he had grown to love over the long months she had lived with him 
and his family.  He turned the corner and ran down the almost empty hall 
leading to the Royal Juraian Landing Pad.  The threw open the doors just in 
time to be hit with a massive gust of wind.  In the center of the landing 
pad was the beady eyed servant boy that he had seen earlier.  In his arms 
was Sasami, screaming his name and reaching out for him.

	"YOU'RE TOO LATE YOSHO!  WE HAVE HER NOW!"  Yelled Zeb as he 
levitated eighteen feet off of the ground.  Sasami just screamed even 
louder.  Yosho fought the high winds as he headed toward Sasami, 
occasionally being blown back by the powerful gusts.  The area then became 
distorted and was flooded by a dark presence.  A blanket of darkness began 
to envelope Sasami and Zeb.

	"BROTHER!  GET OFF OF JURAI!  THEIR GOING TO..." Sasami shouted 
before they both disappeared.  Yosho looked at the now empty spot with 
despondency as the winds died down.  Sasami's words rang in his head.  
Taking those words to heart, he ran back into the building.

*************************************************************************************

	"WHOA!"  exclaimed Washu without a single warning.

	"WHAT!?"  replied Ryoko, mad a Washu for making her jump.

	"I just monitored a massive dimensional rip in the space/time fabric!  It was amazing!  Good thing I had monitored the planet at that exact moment, or I might've missed it!"

	"Well, good, I hope your happy.  What does it mean?"  returned Ryoko.

	"It MEANS that one of our boys in black decided to go home.  Now, 
all I have to do is extrapolate several variables in order to find out the 
exact coordinates of the Dark Juraian home dimension!  We're gonna kick some 
Dark Juraian ASS NOW BUDDY!"  

	"Uh, okay..." replied Ryoko, not quite sure what she meant, but she 
knew it must be something that'll give them an edge against this seemingly 
invincible enemy.  Ryo-oki then made a sound and flipped off the monitors.  
Jurai was within plain sight now, and growing by the second.

*************************************************************************************

	Yosho, horribly tired and depressed, barely got on the shuttle in 
time.  With a loud CLANG the doors sealed shut and the last transport ship 
off of Jurai began to shudder.  Then, shortly after, it took off.  
Yosho made his way toward the window and stared at the rapidly shrinking 
ground.

	"Sasami..." he said to himself as he pounded his head against the 
hull, feeling powerless.  Then, a hand touched his shoulder ever so 
slightly.  Behind him were two young children.

	"You see!  I told you he looked just like him!"  the boy said to the 
girl.

	"Wow!  Your right!  He DOES look like him!"  the girl responded.

	"May I help you?" Yosho said weakly.

	"I'm sorry sir.  We just thought you looked like the legendary 
warrior Yosho.  We saw his picture all over the palace when we visited 
there.  You bare a striking resemblance."

	"Yeah, you do!"  said the girl, her eyes glittering.  Her smiling 
disposition made Yosho think of Sasami.  His eyes go soft and sad, and the 
children notice this.

	"Hey, mister, what's wrong?" the little girl asked, her smile 
fading.

	"Yeah, what's wrong?"  the boy added.

	"Nothing.  I'm, just a little... tired.  Come here, I'll tell you of 
the great warrior Yosho and his adventures on the small planet of Earth."  
Yosho responded, trying to smile as brightly as possible.  The two children 
smile at each other and then leaped on Yosho as they knocked him into a 
chair that was placed next to the hull of the ship.  

	"Now, our story begins with a great demon, who went on a rampage of 
death and destruction..." Yosho began.

*************************************************************************************

	The Warrior Demon rose his muscular biomechanical arms into the air, 
his eyes glowed brighter and brighter as Dark Juraian energy coursed around 
his body.  He rose into the air as he faded away into the swirling air.  The 
robed figures surrounding the planet moved faster and faster as black energy 
coursed in between them.  The Transport holding Yosho and the last survivors 
of Jurai barely made it past the rapidly moving robed figures and leaped 
into hyperspace.  Ryo-oki finally slowed to a planetary entry speed, and 
sensing something wrong, Ryo-oki stopped.

	"What's wrong Ryo-oki?"  asked Ryoko in a concerned voice.

	"MEOW!!"  Shouted Ryo-oki.  

	"What?"  Ryoko asked as her head whipped forward due to Ryo-Oki's 
rapidly accelerating reverse speed.  

	"Ryo-oki... STOP!"  screamed Ryoko.  Ryo-oki reluctantly did as she 
commanded and stopped a far distance away from the planet.  The rest of the 
fleet was still far behind.  

	"What's going on down there?"  wondered Washu, as it suddenly 
occurred to her.  "Oh, God..."

	"What!?"  repeated Ryoko, angry at being left out of the loop.

	"Oh, God.  Ryoko!  Turn around!"  shouted Washu again.  

	"Not until I know what the HELL'S going on!"  shouted Ryoko, who 
finally had enough.

	"Yes, Washu, tell us.  What's wrong?"  asked Misaki.

	"You want to know?  Then keep looking at Jurai." said Washu, 
finally giving in.  

	The others began to look at Jurai.  Even Ayeka got up from her perch 
in her lonely corner and look out at Jurai.  Black energy began to course 
around the planet, and thick green clouds began to form.  Ayeka's eyes 
widened, along with Funhao's and Misaki's.  Soon, the planet seemed to break 
out in large flames and shake violently.  Without warning, as large 
telekinetic shockwave shot past Ryo-oki and out into space.  Everyone on 
board began to scream in horrendous pain and suffering as their heads felt 
like they were going to explode.  And during this painful ringing in the 
back of their heads, the planet of Jurai went up in a bright flash of light.  Soon, the ringing faded away and everyone opened their eyes.

	"Shit..."  whispered Ryoko as she looked out to where Jurai used to 
be.  'Holy shit!  Jurai's gone!  How can anything DO that?!'  thought 
Ryoko.  She then looked at Ayeka, who's face was as pale as it has ever 
been.  She watched as Ayeka's eyes rolled into the back of her head.  She 
continued to watch as she fell to the ground, having fainted.  She heard two 
other thumps.  She turned her head and saw Misaki and Funhao collapsed on 
the floor.  Then, she noticed that the Juraian fleet had finally caught up 
to her.  They parked and stared at the empty space that was Jurai.  There 
wasn't even any debris.  Even in the Yagami, the normally empty headed 
Mihoshi just stared out the window at the empty space in disbelief.  Kiyonne 
began to shake her head, denying what had apparently happened.  Everyone 
just stood there, staring, not believing that Jurai, the most POWERFUL 
empire in the known universe, was gone.  The Emperor was dead, and now Jurai 
was gone.  A wind of hopelessness blew through the somewhat small fleet of 
ships...
