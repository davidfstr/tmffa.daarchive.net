Washu quickly typed on her holo computer.She wiped the sweat from
her forehead,looking up at her unhappy daughter.

"DAMNIT WASHU!"Cried Ryoko from her place next to the mad scientist.

The red haired woman stared at her."I'm doing this for you lil Ryoko."

She sighed deeply looking at the machines around her and on her."Do I 
need all this??"

Washu simply noded,still typing.

"But...why??"She asked very confused.

"These are to watch your brain waves.Control your heart...stuff like
that."She smiled."I AM SUCH A GENIUS!!!"

She sighed  and closed her eyes.

There was a knock on the door as a young man walked into the lab.
"Lunch is ready!"He called.

Ryoko smiles happily as she jumped toward Tenchi.She had forgotten she
was hooked up to Washus machines.She fell,landing on her face.She 
looked up as a huge bandaid covered her nose.

"My silly lil Ryoko should be more careful!!"

A growel escaped her lips.She tried to ignore her mother.

Tenchi helped Ryoko to her feet."Are you ok Ryoko?"

"Ummm...yea."Ryoko replied.

Ayeka walked in,she looked to see Ryoko and Tenchi to what seemed to
be holding hands."Lo...Lord Tenchi..."

The young prince quickly dropped her hand."I was..helping her to her 
feet is all Ms.Ayeka."

Ayeka blushes slightly as she relized the prediciment.

"We'd better go eat before Sasami's food gets cold."Tenchi told them
all.

The three girls nodded in agreement as two walked to the door.

"Washu-Chan come eat with us!"Smiled Tenchi.

She pushed her computer away and looked to him."Well prehaps I do need
a break."

Tenchi nodded as they all made their way out of the lab.

Ryoko dissappeared in the kitchen just as the others walked in.

Sasami smiled at them "Lunch is done!!"

Minagi and Ryo-Ohki were seated on each side of Sasami.Everyone else 
sat around the table.

They starting eating there lunch.

"So how is that stuff your doing with Ryoko coming Washu-Chan??"Tenchi
asked the scientist.

"Oh I'm finding this and that.I havent found the main problem yet 
though."

Minagi took in a breath and spoke."Ms.Washu..."

Suddenly a huge gun was pointing in Minagi's face.The gun was held by
Washu.She stood on the kitchen table.

"Escuse me...what did u call me??"

Minagi held her breath and remembered what to call Washu.
"Wa...Washu-Chan.."She studdered.

"CORRECT!!"Washu smiled as she settled back in her seat.

The table sighed loudly as the ate.

"What were you going to say Minagi??"Washu asked her.

"Nothing.."Minagi answered not wanting to anger Washu agian.

"Why not tell me??Come out with it."Urged Washu.

"Well....please don't be angry...if Ryoko is my sister...and your
her mother..whats that make me??"She questioned.

Washu smiles happily."Call me mom!!"

Minagi giggled at the greatest scientific genius."Alright mom!"

"Now if i could get lil Ryoko to say that...."Muttered Washu under 
her breath.

Ryoko gave her 'mother' an evil glare."Why should I!"

Agian Washu sighed."Please Ryoko.....I've been asking so long....is
'mom' such an evil word??Do you really hate me so much??"

The demoness sighed not answering her.

The table went silent.They waited for an answer from Ryoko.

She took in a breath and began."Can..can we speak of this later....
please..."She pleaded.

Washu simply nodded and continued eatting,as did everyone else.They 
were silent the rest of the meal.

After lunch Washu led her daughter back to the lab.She sat her down
in a large chair."Now..tell me."

She sighed heavely.She was happy she was letting it all out..but not.
"Well...for one thing...your forcing me to call you mom.Thats how
Kagato did to me,he wanted me to call him 'daddie'..."

She looked to concern to Ryoko but nodded to let her continue.

"Second...I...I..never really had a mom..or family...I thought you left
me at the age of three.."

Washu frowned."I did not leave..I was taken.."She corrected her 
daugther.

"I...can't bring myself to call you mother because...its Kagatos 
fault..."

Ryoko noticed she was going soft.<Why am I speaking to her like this!>
She tried to toughen up.

Washu only watched as yet agian she was losing her.

She looked back to Washu.She remembered crying on her on that faithful
night..she was there..when I needed her..<STOP THINKING LIKE THIS!!>
Cried Ryoko's thoughts.She couldn't help but think like that.

The scientist noticed the struggle."I will understand if you don't 
want to call me mom."

Ryoko didn't answer but simply stared at her.

"Please...Ryoko,Kagato owns you no longer.Now you may make your own 
desicions."

She trembled at her mothers words.She finially nodded after a long
momment."Thank you....I'm ready now mom.."

Sasami and Minagi cleared the table.They didn't mind the work at all.
In fact they really enjoyed eachothers company.

Ayeka walked through to see the two doing chores.She smiled at them
both."You two are doing a wonderful job."She commented.

Sasami giggled as Minagi blushed at the comment.

Ayeka continued on to the living room as she settled down on the couch.
She grabed the remote switching the channels till she got to her soap.
She began eatting a rice craker."Ohh a juciy part!!"She smiles,she
noticed what she just said."CLIMATIC MOMMENT!!"She corrected herself.

Kiyone poked her head through the door leading to the living room.
Mihoshi was dragged behind her.

"Ms.Ayeka,would you happen to know where Tenchi is??"Kiyone asked the
princess.

"The carrot feilds,why do you ask?"

"We must leave to the Galaxy Police headquarters for a bit.We'll be
back soon."Kiyone told her.

"And why must you leave??"

"Top secret!!!"Mihoshi giggled.

"B..but I'm the First Princess of Jurai!!!"

They quickly bowed,saying something about having there orders.Then  
went to find Tenchi.

Tenchi pulled a carrot,putting it in the basket.A carrot stub flug out
of the basket as quickly as he put them in.

"Ryo-Ohki!Stop being so selfish!"Tenchi said picking the cabbit up
gentely.

The Galaxy Police officers finially made it.With the way Mihoshi took
them it took almost a half hour to get to a 5 min. destination.

Tenchi looked up from scolding Ryo-Ohki."Hi,what are you two doing
out here??"

"We came to tell you were leaving for a bit Tenchi."Kione responded.

Mihoshi simply nodded her head.

He smiled at them both."Alright,but be careful."

"We will"They said in unision.

He watched them ride off into the sky.

Ryoko finially got up from the chair."I..don't know if i can call you
that in front of the others."

Washu smiled brightly."I'm just happy you call me mom at all!!!"

She nodded dissappearing out of the lab.

"You have grown up my lil Ryoko..."She said silently to herself.

The demoness appeared in the living room.She settle on the couch.

Ayeka didn't even acknolege her.

Tenchi walked through the door wiping the sweat from his face."Aren't
you suspose to be in Washu's lab Ryoko??"

She shoke her head no."I get a break."

Ayeka looked at her."You probly sneaked out of the lab."

"I DID NOT!!"Screamed Ryoko.

"When did I ever listen to you.."Ayeka continued.

Ryoko trembled with anger."I DID NOT LEAVE MOM'S LAB!!"She quickly
when the word escaped her lips.She blushes a bit,and tried to correct
herself."Errr....Washu.."

Tenchi smiled at her."Your calling her mom now?I think thats good
Ryoko."

She sighed and turned away.She bit her bottom lip so she wouldn't say
anything else.

"I would give anything to have my mother,you should be happy you have
one."He tried to force a smile.

Washu wander out of her lab."Ryoko dear your breaks over!"

Ryoko shuddered when she heard 'dear'.Then she smiled."See you silly
princess,I didn't lie."She stuck out her tounge,pulling the skin under
her right eye.

Ayeka looked at her then laughed."Now your acting like a child!!"

She groweled as she was pulled into the lab.

Tenchi looked toward Ayeka."You two should relly stop fighting.."

She sighed and nodded."Prehaps your right..gomen."

Ryoko crossed her arms as she stared at Washu."Are we done yet!?"

The scientist simpely laughed."Almost..."

She frowned at her mother.

Minagi walked into the lab.She held a basket in her hands."Mom??"She
called.

"Over here!!!"

She walked on til she found her mother and tied up sister.

"Ryoko..???"

Washu laughed,removing the strap that held Ryoko down.

Ryoko stood up, brushing back her hair."Whats up??"

She smiled to her sister."Rice cracker??"

Sasami followed with four cups of tea."here!Snacks and company!"

Washu nodded as they all sat down.Ryoko floated.

They began talking and snacking.Sudden a cool breeze swept the lab.It
became unbelvibly cold,unexplainablely cold.

Ryoko froze as a cold breeze was felt behind her neck.A chill went down
her spine.She felt an ice cold hand touch her cheek and she began to
shake uncontrolably.A whisper touched her ear quietly.

"Happy anniversy Ryoko..."

She turned quickly and saw the face she thought she would never see
agian."Kagato!"

Tenchi walked toward the kitchen door.He peeked his head through the
door to see it empty.He sighed as he wandered back to the living room.
He quickly stopped,a feeling of dread washed over him.

"Lord Tenchi are you alright?"Asked the princess.

Tenchi shoke the feeling away and smiled."Of course I'm ok."

The crowd in the lab barreled out.Their was shear terror in their 
faces.

Ryoko luanched into Tenchi's arms.She trembled,she tried to stop but 
couldn't.Instead she closed her eyes hugging him.

Ayeka looked angry to the demoness."Get your hands off Lord Tenchi!!!"
She screamed.

The young prince looked at Ayeka.He looked down to show the angry
princess that Ryoko was trembling.Then he nodded his head up to show
the faces of fear on the others.

She looked at them all in surprise."Why are you all so frightened??"

Ryoko looked up to Tenchi.She tried to hold back her tears and 
shaking voice."Ka..Kagato.."

He held his breath and looked toward Ryoko."It's ok now Ryoko,hes
gone."

She shoke her head and and began to cry mildly.

Tenchi looked to the others as they nodded in agreement.

A ghastly figure slid across the wall.It hopped off the wall,landing
next to Tenchi.

The cold wind blew agian as everyone froze in terror.

"Ryoko...you shouldn't run from daddie.."

She looked into his face."Basterd, I'm no child of yours!!!"

Tenchi stood in front of her."Is it me you want?"

"Actually I want BOTH."He smiled evily.

Washu pushed past her daughters and faced him."There's nothing you can
do in that form.You can't take us under control."

He just smiled at the scientist.

This made Washu angryer as she pulled out an energy sword.

Ryoko jumped,she had never seen Washu this mad since Dr.Clay.

He laughed at Washu madly."You think that will stop me!!"Having said
that he simply walked through Washu and to Ryoko.

She pulled out her own enery sword shoving it in Kagato's face.She 
pulled down on the sword.

The sword slid through him as though it didnt touch him.

She looked in surprise as she had seen what happened.She felt 
freezing hands touch her face.

"Ryoko...now,you will remember me.In all ways.."Kagato smiled bring
her face close to his.

She screamed pulling away with all her might.It was too late as she
fell back on her brusied arm.She noticed blood,everywhere."Damn you
Kagato!"She said weakly getting up as she heard a crack from her ankle.
She fell crying in pain.

"Like I said 'daughter." Another grin spread across his face.

She winced in pain as she fell to her side.The pain was to great to
hide.She cruled up in a ball on the floor.A puddle of blood surronded
her.

The group ran to Ryoko with concern.

Washu picked up her daughters head laying it in her lap.Blood soaked
her clothes."Oh Ryoko.."cried the red haired woman in a small voice.

Tenchi ran to her side also."Ry..Ryoko.."

"Tenchi!!Take her to my lab!"The scientist told the prince.

"Hai!"He responded about to pick up Ryoko.

"No..leave me...run...just leave.."Pleaded Ryoko,tears forming in her
eyes."He'll.....he has no..."She fell into uncosiousness,unable to
finish her sentence.

Tenchi picked her up without hessitation.

Ayeka looked at the mess that was made by Kagato.she simply frowned,
walking with the crowd into the lab.

Tenchi set the injured Ryoko onto the bed."Now what?"

"Now you all learn to stitch and clean,we gotta stop the bleeding."
Washu informed them."Also this room is Kagato proofed.
Washu quickly showed them there assiment.She smiled as they all did
it correctly.

Ryoko moaned silently as she saw everyone with needles coming down
on her."Wha..What??!!"

"Oh!Lil Ryoko is awake!"Washu smiled happily.

"Don't call me that.."Ryoko whispered.

Finially the stitching and cleaning was over.

Ryoko looked down at the brace on her ankle.She felt her ear to find
blood."Hmmm...Kagato's doing..that basterd."

The scientist handed a cotton ball for Ryoko's ear.

"So..what happened?"Asked Tenchi,very confused.

Both Ryoko and Washu sighed at once.

"Well..."Began Washu but was cut off.

"It's my storie!!!"Cried Ryoko.

"Fine..fine.."

"Anyway..what happened is..every scar I got from Kagato came back to
me.All at once."The demoness breathed in and looked at them all.

"Wow Ryoko!Thats alotta scars though."Sasami said with a tint of 
concern.

"Well,I did get a lot of scars Sasasmi."

Some how Washu had dissappeared from the group.

"Mom??"Wondered Minagi looking about.

"I'm here!"washu said smiling holding up a bottle.

Ayeka read the bottle out loud."Soul be gone.Whats soul be gone??"

"Glad you asked Ms.Ayeka!It will rid us of Kagato with one splash!"

The group got sweat drops staring at Washu oddly.

"Well it will!!!"She cried in protest.I'll prove it!"She stepped out
of the lab.

The group followed in curiousity.

Ryoko lagged behind the group,not to thrilled to see Kagato agian.

"Kagato!Show yourself!"Tenchi yelled mockingly ready for battle.

Kagato came out facing the boy."THIS FIGHT IS..."

Washu splashed the dark figure with the whole bottle.

Unable to finish his sentence,he turned to ash.

"Could somebody please clean up this mess??"Asked Washu as she 
walked into her lab.

Everyones mouths were open as Sasami cleaned the ashes from the floor
with the broom.

From that point on,Ryoko had no more flashbacks.Unwanted ones that is.
Kagato had no more control.Everything was now peaceful(as peaceful
in the Masaki household that is!).
