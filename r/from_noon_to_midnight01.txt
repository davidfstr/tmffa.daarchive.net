Ok that's outta the way, OK after maybe a month after writing From Noon to 
Midnight, I wise up to how lame it really is. ^_^'So this is the 
revised version of it. (Maybe having a name like Z-Caliber has something to do 
with the first one not being good?) 
Ok, the revised version has: No more lame wise cracks and no more chick named 
Takimi (Sorry Tokimi ^-^') ok so I only changed her name, 
but shes still the flamboyant sister of... oops! Spoiler! =O. Ok untill I get 
this fic thing write ill have to stick with the script format. =( 
That is untill someone E-Mails me telling me my fic stinks and i need to change 
the format.
Ok, no more Yakking. On with the fic. No constitutions exceptions exchanges or 
refunds.
