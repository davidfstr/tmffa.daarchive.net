Author's notes: Well as you can read here, I'm continuing this story, ...
with some changes! First I will be covering several
weeks instead of a single day as each chapter had been. Also, Yota is the
name of the lead love interest in a wonderful Anime
called "Video Girl Ai", but the name is the only thing I took from that
series, the characterization is my own (ACC) . He will
become more important as the story goes, but will do his duty, as a proper
ACC should. Finally a word of thanks goes to all
that have asked that this story go on. I will update this one every few
weeks, and please keep an eye out for my rewrites of my
first Tenchi story "Family and Friends" due out the 2nd week of April!
Thanks again and enjoy the story! dennsiud

Chapter #11: The First Two Months

A bright, warm, a cheerful Okoyama Morning greeted those residents of the
Masaki home Valley. A month had passed since the
startling revelations that occurred at Tenchi's graduation party that
affected them all

The previous month had seen the week long visit of the Royal family to
their off springs and those now betrothed to them. As
the Emperor and his wives occupied their week's vacation in getting to know
the extended family better, and to gauge the
realization that first Yousho wouldn't serve as the next Emperor, and that
Tenchi would then become the next in line. Azusa
Was not amused at that thought, but he had come to realize, especially with
Tenchi's defeat of Lord Ito, and the rescue of sorts
of his Brother Yota, Tenchi had proven to the old crusty ruler that Tenchi
could be compassionate, but strong all at the same.

So, with that settled in the Emperor's mind came another problem, How to
inform, gauge and direct the probable onslaught of
Media on Jurai's New Prince, and especially, his consorts (Mainly Ryoko)
Then he had a simple yet brilliant plan,... have his
wives handle the preparations for the Coronation of Tenchi, plus the
marriage ceremonies of the three Unions. Yes, even
Nobuyuki and Mihoshi. Even though they had already married, Under Jurai
Law, Nobuyuki, by marrying Achika first, and
then being officially adopted by Katsuhito (Yousho) became a defacto Prince
as well. When informed of this he, was not happy,
because it meant to him he would not be able to keep his chosen profession.
But, Azusa informed his Grandson in law that he
didn't have to serve since he wasn't a direct descendant to the Royal
family. Happily he agreed and so he would just simply a
Prince in name only. Mihoshi was also happy since if he had to serve in
some capacity on Jurai, she wouldn't keep her position
as Galaxy Police officer. Though Nobuyuki had reservations about Mihoshi
returning to duty after their child's birth, he backed
down when he was informed that Misato would become a resident officer, so
she would stay on earth, and he could continue
being an architect. As Nobuyuki and Mihoshi made it through the first month
now permanently moved into the apartment in
Okoyama (still connected to the Masaki home with a Sub-space portal
courtesy of Washu) the rest of the family also made out
well the first month. Mainly getting all the supplies needed for the new
arrivals to come, and of course, maternity clothes for all
four women. There were several mini- shopping sprees as all four girls
added to their wardrobes with Earth based fashions.

Ayeka, Tenchi and Ryoko were getting along... like newlyweds, since Washu
had lifted the ban on intimate encounters!
Through the first month, all three had become very close, with the girls'
focus on Tenchi and he on them. Though there were
times when each girl had Tenchi to herself, it was more common for all
three to be together. And most would say that the girls
were intimate with each other that would be not totally wrong. Ryoko and
Ayeka had agreed to share Tenchi's love, and they
had become each other's best friends, that did not translate to intimacy
for each other. Though they did comfort each other
(Tenchi's weekend trip to Okoyama University to arrange a dorm room, and
other details for the fall term) they didn't have sex
with each other. So, that was the extent of their relationship. But when it
came to Tenchi, they both couldn't get enough of him.
As the month came to a close, things were about ... to get dicey!

They all knew that the trip to Jurai would come soon, so they also had
classes via Washu comm link with Jurai, with Funaho,
and Misaki taking turns going over proper etiquette and protocol with the
Future Princes and Princesses.

Then as the fourth week ended, The real fun began!
____________________________________________________________________________________________

Morning Sicknesses

Washu, being ever vigilant, had installed subspace portals to the bathroom
in every bedroom the girls were in anticipation of
what every female terran, or Galactic went through, ... morning sickness!
What she didn't know was that she'd be the first one
to use it for that purpose.

"WHAT THE HELL!?!?!?" was all Washu could say as she got out of the bed she
had shared with Yousho at the Masaki Shrine,
At 3 a.m. she headed for the bathroom, making it at the nick of time.

"Blaaaah" was all Yousho heard for the next few moments as he got up and
knelt beside his love as Washu was worshipping the
porcelain goddess. As he rubbed her back, Washu continued spewing into the
toilet for about 5 more minutes. When she had
spent the last of the contents of her stomach, she leaned back onto him.
Sighing, She gathered his left arm around her, and
stayed in that position as Yousho soothed her with his back rub with his
right, and saying some calming words.

Finally she motioned for him to help her up, and they made their way to
Washu's portal, which led to her lab. Later after
various test were performed by her automated and preprogrammed robots, she
confirmed the obvious, Her first bout with
Morning sickness. What soured Washu even more was the fact that she would
go through this off and on, for the next 3 months.
But even through this she smirked. She knew she wouldn't be alone since the
other girls should start their bouts soon enough.

And within that same week, the three other girls also started worshipping
their own porcelain goddesses as well. Mihoshi, who
was the next to get the MS bug was with Nobuyuki at their apartment,
Nobuyuki being pre warned had the bathroom ready, and
a hot water bottle and some Midol® for her when she also broke a new record
running to their bathroom. Then they used their
portal to the house and Washu checked her out to make sure everything was
OK.

Tenchi had the bad luck of having both Ayeka and Ryoko have morning
sickness at the same time. That morning Tenchi was
awakened by various stomach grumbling from his two fiancés. Though they
were still both asleep, they both unconsciously held
their stomachs as though it was aching. Tenchi remembered what Washu had
warned him about. That a woman who might be
starting their cycle of morning sickness. One of the warning signs was the
woman clutching her abdomen. Instantly and
carefully Tenchi removed himself from between his two grumbling loves and
headed for the bathroom to get all his
preparations ready and to have the sink ready since there was only one
toilet.

His efforts were rewarded when 20 minutes later Ryoko fazed in and barfed
up in the toilet, then 10 seconds later Ayeka
grabbed the sides of the sink and began regurgitating. Tenchi, who had a
close pin on his nose, had towellettes and hot water
bottles ready and led the two green gilled women down the stairs carefully
to the living room.

The living room, had 4 couches in a semi-circle now there courtesy of
Washu. Each girl now took residence in one of each of
the couches with a bucket near each one. Sasami and Tenchi were the main
one who took care of the girls, as Yousho had to be
at the shrine, and Nobuyuki had finished his vacation time and was at work.
Yota, who was now being trained to be Washu's
assistant, had to keep Washu's lab from blowing up.

Though Yota had barely been there a month, he had an amazingly keen mind.
As Washu soon found out, Yota sucked up
knowledge like water to a sponge. By the end of the month, Yota could run
the lab adequately enough to let Washu have a night
off to be with Yousho. Now with Washu sidelined, Yota could keep the lab
running and basically ran back and forth to Washu
who was laying on one of the couches in the Masaki living room. For now
Yota was content, probably because he wasn't asked
to feed his powers to his ex-brother anymore. He volunteered to help Washu
and was glad to do it. It gave the 12-year-old
purple haired Jurian boy a purpose of his choosing. One that wasn't
predetermined for him.

So, the threesome had the task of keeping the four pregnant women as
comfortable as possible without one of them blowing up
at them, each other, or the house. As all were galactics, they had powers
that could wreck havoc on any one or anything
surrounding them. And if your wondering where Ryo-Oki was, she was the
smartest of all, and stayed in a kitchen cupboard,
away from the area of any yelling, screaming, or things blowing up.

As the girls' hormonal imbalances adjusted, they started to get back to a
semblance of normality, at least when it came to them.
They had to, since in one month they'd be on Jurai, getting officially
married at the Royal palace. Their education in Royal
protocol and marriage ceremony was beginning, and they had to learn it by
the time they got there, since any major screw-up
would reflect badly on them, as well as the Emperor. So their priority
became that for the second month.

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Yota's Future

After the MS week ended, on his free time, Yota headed towards the end of
the dock that sat in the Masaki's lake behind their
house. Two of the home's residents were concerned of the boy's sullen mood
and his now daily ritual that Yota had started since
his arrival a month before.

Sasami, who had a rather obvious interest for the quiet boy sat next to a
recovering Washu who had taken in Yota as his foster
mother while The Jurai High council, and the Royal family debated his fate.
If it was up to Washu, Yota would stay with the
Masaki's, not because of his intelligence, or his being her assistance, but
for her genuine heart felt feelings towards the quiet,
and brooding boy. There was something that drew her to him, like a mother
cat to a weeping kitten. Her motherly instincts
heightened by her pregnancy didn't diminish this feeling, so her interests
for the boy was as genuine as Sasami, though as a
different form of caring. After a brief discussion, Washu changed back to
her child form and both walked out towards the
dock.

As the two girls walked towards the young man, he was thinking troubling
thoughts. Though, he was happy, the happiest he had
ever been in his life, he was still sad. He thought at first that it was a
depressive reaction to his being rescued from his virtual
slavery by Ito and the Makoto family. But, as the month ran on he found
that the sadness was not coming from anyone around
him here, but from someplace far away. His habit of coming out to the end
of the dock became the norm since the first few days
of his stay at the Masaki residence.

The two girls sat on either side of him and smiled at him. Washu still used
her child form when working with him in the lab. So
he was used to her in this form. Of course Sasami had made it known of her
feelings for him since they day he came. So, he was
all smiles when they sat down beside him. "Well, Yota how come you are here
staring into the sky everyday after dinner,
Hmmm?" Asked Washu quite directly. But of course Yota was used to the
Washu's unique way of doing things. So, he was
becoming just as direct and to the point.

"I come here to think about the day's events, and wish my real parents
where ever they are my love and thanks to end up here
... with you," said Yota.

"Do your well wishes include us as well Yota?" asked Sasami

"Yes. Now that it's been a month, I can include you and the others in my
prayers of hope and kindness." replied Yota as he
looked at Sasami's pink eyes with a smile.

They then talked about the developments of the girls' pregnancies, and the
hard work that Yota, Sasami, and Tenchi did to help
the girls through it. Talk turned to the upcoming trip to Jurai. Although
the family as a whole was enthusiastic, Yota was
hesitant to return due to the fact that his fate was to be made at the same
time, as the marriages were to occur.

Yota then asked a question. "I hope I'm not being too forward, ... but
Sasami, (He grabbed her hand hesitantly) will you walk
with me?" Sasami's face was as bright as the noonday sun as she shook her
head yes, and both stood up. They made their
good-byes to A now smirking Washu as both moved up the deck holding hands,
as they then turned towards the nearest path that
eventually led to the shrine. After their walk they made their way back to
the house. As Yota bid good night to Sasami, he
headed to Tenchi's old room, now his, to prepare for tomorrow's work in
Washu's lab and to think about what Sasami and had
talked about. As he then prepared for bed, a strange green aura enveloped
him for about 10 seconds. During this time he
seemed in a trance, then as soon as it vanished, Yota went about his
business as if nothing happened.

Only one of the residents had felt this strange occurrence. Yousho, who was
at the Shrine finishing up some paperwork, felt that
presence of the aura. Though he could not pinpoint who or where it was, he
definitely felt it. But, after that it didn't occur
again. Only later at a precise moment would he feel it again, and by then
it might be too late.

The Trip to Jurai

As the time for departure came closer, the classes all were taking were
becoming more intense. Misaki via Intergalactic
Vid-phone was going over the specific greetings given to ambassadors of
lesser wolds when Ryoko asked innocently; "Why do
we have to do all these specific greetings, and being so nice to these
guys?"

Misaki sighed heavily, and then answered; "My dear little Ryoko, You have
to realize that as a Jurian Princess that you will be
you have certain duties and responsibilities you have and..."

Ryoko got up in a huff and yelled out, "All I wanna do is love my Tenchi
and have a quiet life. I don't want to be in the
spotlight. I've had enough of that as Kagato's killing tool, and I just
can't...." She fell where she stood, only caught by Tenchi
before she hit the ground hard, Ayeka was by their side moments later
checking her friend and trying with Tenchi to revive
her.

"Oh My Goddess help her please!" Was all Misaki could say, as she was
witness to what happened. Washu then took her Tenchi
and Ayeka with Ryoko in his arms to her lab, as the rest of the family
followed. This left the open link where Misaki was there
sobbing and putting her hand on the screen worried for her future daughter
in law.

Within a few minutes, Washu made the rest of the family leave the Lab
except Yota and Yousho. After a few minutes Washu
came out to the living room to brief the rest of the clan on Ryoko's
condition. Tenchi and Ayeka stood up holding each other
with worried looks in their eyes. Tenchi finally spoke. "Mom, how's Ryoko?
Please tell us, ... is she Ok?"

"Well All she did was have ... a fainting spell. Quite common with most
females at this stage of their pregnancies." Washu
smiled at the family, calming their fears, and then concluded. " I think
you men better keep an eye on us since this can happen
to us all. So, I suggest that we be with our loves as much as possible. Now
that does not mean too much stress, if you know what
I mean, but just try to keep an eye on how you feel ladies. If we say that
we're tired, then make sure we rest, even if we protest!
Got it guys?" The men all shook their heads yes and then hugged their
respective wives and fiancés as another minor crisis
passes.

Final preparations were made as Washu had Ryo-Oki in her ship form, in her
lab. She modified the cabbit-ship by adding a
Subspace second deck with Rooms for all the family. This didn't add to
Ryo-Oki in size or mass, but allowed all of them to
travel together. As Ryo-Oki lifted off with the whole clan in tow. It left
Earth's atmosphere and headed for the edge of the solar
system. After reaching that, it engaged it's light speed drive and headed
for the Planet Jurai, and a very momentous wedding!

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Jurai's Reaction!

As Funaho and Misaki were controlling the data being feed to the Jurian
Empire's Media, the populous was slowly made aware
first of Ayeka's and Sasami's whereabouts, as well as Yousho's, but also of
Tenchi, and finally Ryoko and their associations with
each other. There were protests from various groups who objected to Ryoko,
Tenchi, Ayeka's marriage to them, Yousho's
return, and even once minor group who objected to Nobuyuki's inclusion in
the Royal family. So the Queen's put a special spin
on all of them. Acknowledging the facts from the  Kagato incident, to Dr.
Clay's capture, they put the best foot forward and put
the Masaki clan in a better light to the Jurai people.

This was being greeted well by most of the Empire's populace. But those
small groups could become a point of concern, so
using their positions as Captain of the Emperor's guard, and Head of
Intelligence, The Queens slowly, methodically either
disbanded, or severely disrupted each groups organization and movements.
They hoped that with all they had done, nothing
could happen that would jeopardize their family.

Meanwhile:

In a place existing outside any dimension or universe. The Omnipotent being
called D3, was reporting on a certain group's
whereabouts and activities to the only Chouishin Goddess left in power, The
Goddess Tokimi. "Milady, our agent is now within
their household giving daily report of their activities." Said A solemn D3.

"And, what of my sisters, and her families ... conditions?" Asked a curious
Tokimi.

"They are progressing in their conditions as well as could be expected."
replied D3.

"And our champion, is his powers now perfected, ... and ready?" She asked.
" Then allow them to reach the end of their
Conditions before allowing our champion to test Tsunami's champion."

"What if Washu's champion and their consort intercede?" D3 asked
hesitantly.

"Then, I will make sure they will not. I want to test His potential, as
well as to see what he will do."

"Then, milady, that will be done." replied D3.

"Good, I will take my leave then, and keep me informed of my families
conditions D3," finished Tokimi.

"As you wish!" Concluded D3 as both entities vanished from the void they
came.

Now that they're all finally on their way To Jurai to be married, the
various couples get ready for marriage. How will Tokimi
influence the weddings? We will learn Yota's fate, what reaction will Yota
have to Washu, and Yousho's proposal, and Yota's
and Sasami's budding Friendship is put to the test in;
