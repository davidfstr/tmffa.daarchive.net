begins painful steps to mature. An introspective look




Chapter 8:

                                      “  Tokyo  ”


The inhabitants of the okiya were slumbering peacefully in their soft, warm 
futons. Each member since the arrival of the baby, had slept less and less. 
Mikimoto - Fei decided to call her son after the famous pearl cultivator – 
was normally a very quiet, extremely adorable baby. With rosy cheeks and 
that irresistible baby smell. When he came home, bundled within Fei’s arms 
the family spent countless hours ogling and aahing him. Most of all Ryoko. 
She loved her godson, and loved to see him smile and gurgle when she cradled 
him.
They spent so much time together that after a few days, Ryoko had to start 
attending parties again and was normally out all night long. During these 
nights, that given Ryoko’s growing popularity in the teahouses was more and 
more frequent, Mikimoto would not go to sleep. He needed both his mother and 
Ryoko there. Nothing that Fei, Serla and Basho would do worked. In the 
twilight hours, when Ryoko would return, only then did Mikimoto go to sleep, 
and as a result Serla, Basho, and Fei had constant dark shadows under their 
eyes.
Ryoko, used to the unusual hours, was as beautiful as ever, and
Ryo-ohki did not hear Mikimoto’s scream, she could sleep through a tornado.

Ryoko quietly slipped of her kimono and obi. She used a moist, warm cloth to 
carefully remove her makeup. She had been out with the Ambassador all night 
and had had a blazing good time. As a geisha, Ryoko new she should not 
entertain for only one man, all night long. Not because of the man, but 
because it was less money. More parties, meant more money, and the more 
people wanted you, the more they would pay for your time. But in the 
Ambassador’s case, he had reserved this day in advanced and had offered a 
very hefty sum. One Ryoko could not turn down, though she left all the 
financial dealings to Serla, she still had the last word.
He took her to the fall show in the planetarium. The roof was gigantic and 
full of stars. For an instant, standing in the middle of the room, arms 
outstretched, back arched and hands opened, she felt she was back in space.

After, he took her walking around the city park, which was full of 
blossoming cherry trees. The rich, comforting smell made Ryoko relax and the 
ambassador was delighted at her new carefree attitude. Most of the shields 
Ryoko built up while entertaining came down in that walk.

“So how is Miki?” he asked Ryoko while they strolled around the trees. The 
sun was long gone, and the moon supplied a gorgeous afterglow, making 
everything shine from within it seemed.

Ryoko had been silent for the past few minutes, and the ambassador feared 
she was closing up again. His only line of defense was to get Ryoko talking 
about something she loved, Mikimoto.

“Miki gets more handsome everyday. And you should see how Kitty takes care 
of him. Helping me bathe him and powder his tushy - ”

“You bathing a baby! I can’t believe it.”
He interrupted her with an amused laugh.
Ryoko cocked an eyebrow in response.

“You better believe it. And why are you so surprised anyway? You don’t think 
I look like this and act like this every hour of the day do you?” Before he 
had a chance to respond, Ryoko laid her index finger on his lips and leaned 
in to whisper, “You must not be as smart as you say… You better give that 
title back before they figure you out.”

Their faces were millimeters apart, and the ambassador was in total
enrapture at their closeness that he didn’t notice he was holding his breath 
and leaning in himself. Ryoko could feel the warmth from his body, and felt 
tiny butterflies in her stomach. The moon’s light mixed with her more than 
perfect vision and with the added pinch of too much sake was making her legs 
feel wobbly and her head float in the clouds.

Fall was bowing out as winter slowly took over, and as a greeting sent a 
cold breeze that made Ryoko shiver and the ambassador embrace her. Now there 
they stood. He with his arms around her, faces as close as possible and both 
shaking, she from the cold and he from the closeness of their bodies.

“You know Catara? You’re really something. I can’t seem to figure you out.”
He leaned in even closer, almost brushing his lips against her own. Ryoko 
was looking at his mouth, the perfect curves they formed when he smiled.
* He has perfect teeth. *

She looked up and grinned, “I’m just a normal girl.”

“Mmm…” He closed his eyes and caressed her lips with his own. Ryoko’s eyes 
were not completely closed but opened by a fraction, the only thing visible 
a thin line of amber.
Unknowingly her lips had been puckered since they had stopped talking, but 
was it because she wanted to kiss him or because as a geisha she was teasing 
him?

* I wonder what it’d be like to kiss him? But really kiss him. His lips look 
so appetizing. If I could actually taste, then I would definitely give in… 
but not yet. Remember Cat. Remember what Serla had advised me about always 
having the upper hand. If I give in… I’ll loose all the ground I’ve gained 
on him so far.*

Before the ambassador knew what had happened, Ryoko very shrewdly escaped 
his embrace and was walking down the path slowly, looking over her shoulder 
with a grin.

“That wasn’t very nice Catara. You never leave a man hanging on like that.”
He stated with annoyance in his voice. Though it was very minimal, quickly 
replaced by an amused tone. He offered his arm and Ryoko hooked her own with 
his, both walking briskly to the car awaiting them.

“What time do I pick you up to go to governor’s beach house?
He asked as they both settled in the backseat, Ryoko arranging her shawl and 
smoothing her kimono about her. As he asked her, she stiffened slightly and 
her hands went to her lap.
The ambassador observed all of this and frowned, this time with annoyance 
plain in his voice.

“What, your not going with that artist are you?

Ryoko sighed mentally.
* Great! Now he’ll be mad at me for not going with him. How can I explain to 
him that it’s nothing personal? *

“Don’t give me that tone ambassador. You know there is no way I can say no 
to Matobi-san. The exhibition is primarily about me, and I can’t turn my 
back on him.” He turned to face the window, though his hands were balled 
into fists. Ryoko smiled, touched at how much she meant to him.

“Why are you so mad? If it helps any, I will recommend you the best geisha 
in Kyoto. They - ”

“No Catara. I know the other geisha and I don’t want them, I want you, but 
if you can’t come then that’s that.”

He had interrupted her, while still looking out the window. Ryoko rolled her 
eyes and smiled.
* Well… Serla would now definitely say I hold all the cards now.*

The car stopped in front of Ryoko’s okiya and the driver opened her door, 
offering his arm to help her. Ryoko looked at the driver’s hand and at the 
ambassador.

“Listen you. Your going to let me leave like this? Without even a goodbye?”

Still looking out the window, he answered, “What did you have in mind 
geisha?”

“How about a kiss?”


He froze and turned to face her slowly, trying to judge if she was merely 
teasing him again. She wasn’t. He nodded to the driver and he again closed 
the door.
Ryoko for all her bravado was nervous but terribly excited.

This was her first kiss. And she couldn’t judge if it he was a good or bad 
kisser, she had no previous experience, but if her feelings counted for 
anything, she enjoyed it, a lot.

He leaned in… brushing his lips with hers before gently, lovingly guiding 
her along. Kissing her, and she kissing back. The ambassador held her face 
in his hands, Ryoko couldn’t even breathe. Ryoko couldn’t even think, she 
simply went along, enjoying their closeness. Relishing the fact that for 
once in her life she was close to someone in a semi intimate level.

When their kiss ended, she kept her eyes closed. Sighing while licking her 
lips softly.

“Come with me, leave that artist, let me be your damna.”
He asked, almost pleaded with Ryoko.

“All this because of a simple kiss?”
She teased when she had regained her composure.

He frowned and she grinned.
“I’ll be back soon ambassador, I hope you call on me again.”
She knocked on her window, and the driver immediately helped her out.
As she got on the sidewalk, the car window rolled down and he held out a box 
for her.

“This is for you. Wear it when you go to Tokyo and no matter what they might 
do to persuade you to stay, come back.”

Ryoko’s shawl slipped from her shoulders and she shivered in the cold.

“Go ahead Catara. I want you to have it.”

She took the small box from his hands and smiled. A sweet, small smile in 
gratitude.

“See you soon ambassador.”

Now as she quietly tip toed to Fei’s bedroom, checking on Ryo-ohki and Miki, 
she couldn’t hold her curiosity any longer and took out the tiny box.
She sat down gently at the edge of Fei’s futon. For the past few weeks it 
had been their futon. Miki slept peacefully with both of them present, and
Ryo-ohki slept with her. So all four of them shared the room, with Fei, 
Ryo-ohki and Ryoko in the futon.

The box was square cut and could fit in the palm of her hand. With gold 
wrapping it looked exquisite.
She felt the box for the tape at the ends, and quietly pulled them off. 
Normally such patience would be forgotten and she would have simply tore the 
paper off, but she didn’t want to risk waking little Miki.
She peeled the layers of wrapping paper and squinted against the lack of 
light in the room. If was nearly dawn, but the sun was not yet on its way.
The box itself was black and the lid a slightly lighter black tone.
Ryoko bit her lower lip as a force of habit and opened it.
What she found inside made her eyes go round and a withheld gasp escape her 
lips.
It was a gold bracelet. In the baroque style, with matted gold and an 
exquisite work on the finish. It clasped together with a simple circle in 
one end and a small, delicate line on the other. This was beautiful, but 
what immediately caught Ryoko’s eye was the brilliant ruby hanging from it.

* It looks like my gem! *

The coincidence was uncanny. The ambassador had given her a ruby that was 
meant to be worn on her wrist, much like her gem was meant to be worn.
With shaking hands, she clasped it to her left wrist. Enjoying the weight of 
it, comparing the bracelets feel to her real gem.

*Wow. If the ambassador would have given me this before I was out of the 
car, I might have let him get to second base. *

She felt the bed shift and found Ryo-ohki rubbing her eyes while looking at 
her.

“Hey baby, look.”
She scooted closer to Ryo-ohki and showed of her bracelet.

“Pretty. Can I have one?”
Ryo-ohki asked while examining Ryoko’s bracelet, still worn by her sister.

Ryoko smiled and nodded her head while taking her robe off and throwing it 
somewhere on the floor.

As they both settled in between the sheets - Ryo-ohki in the middle with Fei 
still sleeping peacefully next to her -  Ryoko took her bracelet of and 
placed it on Ryo-ohki small wrist.

“Ooh! Looks like gem Cat.”
Ryo-ohki said while shaking her wrist to catch the ruby’s shining rays.

“Doesn’t it Kitty? Okay, enough of that, you need your sleep baby.”

Kitty stretched her arms out to Ryoko and within a few minutes both were 
fast asleep. Ryo-ohki still wore the ruby bracelet.

*       *         *       *            *         *

“Why are you so nervous Cat? I thought you had been to Tokyo before?”

Fei asked Ryoko as she paced back and fourth in her bedroom. The room was 
filled with kimono and obi thrown everywhere. The bed, chair, floor, over 
the mirror….

“Because last time I was there, I wasn’t featured in an exhibition in the 
museum of fine arts of the entire country!”
Ryoko stated in an exasperated tone.

“Don’t worry Cat. You always look beautiful, no matter what you wear. I just 
wish I could come with. Imagine all the people you’ll meet…”
Fei had a far away look in her eyes, and a wistful tone as she sighed.

“Why can’t you come? Miki is almost five months old now. You could come with 
me for the reception and be back here the next day. And you would give me 
moral support.”

Fei nodded and stood up excited.

“Your right! I mean, Serla and Basho could take care of both Ryo-ohki and 
Miki right? What am I going to wear Cat? You have to help me!”

Fei was now pacing back and forth in the room, much like Ryoko had done just 
a few minutes ago. Fei kept picking up kimono and shaking her head, 
dissatisfied with them.

“Don’t worry Fei. You always look beautiful.”
Fei glared at Ryoko’s teasing response and kept pacing the room.

“You should wear something that goes with the bracelet Ambassador Tanaka 
gave you.”

“His name is Tanaka?”
Ryoko asked with curiosity.

“Yes! You never asked him his name?”

“It never came up in conversation I guess.”
Ryoko shrugged her shoulders and flopped down on the futon.

“I think you should wear the bracelet. I don’t want to bring any unwanted 
attention. Besides, I’m planning to go incognito.”

“Incognito! Why?”
Fei asked as she also flopped down on the futon next to her, but with a 
mountain of kimono in her arms.

“To see how people react to the paintings, without knowing I’m actually 
there.”

Fei laughed. “You know. You’re the only person who prefers not be recognized 
when she does something amazing.”

“I didn’t do anything amazing. I just stood still. Matobi, now he is 
amazing.”

“You know, he’ll probably make his move while you two are in Tokyo.”
Fei grinned and pushed her gently with her shoulder.

“Make his move? Matobi?”

“Have you seen the way he looks at you? His face lights up whenever your in 
the same room with him. Plus whenever I talk to him, he is always asking 
about you.”

Ryoko looked at Fei with a pleased smile.
“What does he ask?”

“Oh you know. How you’re doing. If you haven’t changed you mind about going 
with him to Tokyo. How often the ambassador has called on you…”

“Matobi asked about the ambassador?”

“Yeah. Everyone knows how fond he is of you.”

Ryoko remained silent and Fei went over the kimono twice over. Deciding 
which ones where worth bringing to Tokyo.
Ryoko broke the silence.

“I kissed him.”

Fei turned to look at her instantly.

“The ambassador!”

Ryoko nodded while biting her lower lip.
Fei abandoned her kimono, and focused all her attention on Ryoko.

“Yeah…”

“Was he good?”

Ryoko turned to her with a shy grin.
“Well, he didn’t slobber all over my face if that’s what you mean.”

Fei laughed.
“That’s always good.”

“He also asked to be my damna.”

“What did you say?”

“I didn’t really say anything. But can you imagine him as my damna?”

“He is a very good catch. Almost all the geisha in Kyoto would give their 
left arm to be his.”

“I’ll think about it.”

Ryoko snapped out of her thoughts and regained her cheerful mood.

“But for know, we need to get ready, and you need to get your hair done. If 
you still want to become a geisha, I think Matobi’s exhibition is the best 
time to introduce you.”

All Fei did was giggle and hug her friend quickly but warmly as they picked 
out their best kimono.

*         *            *              *                *

“Ryo-ohki I am counting on you to take care of Miki for me. You know apart 
from your sister and me, you are the only one he trusts.”

Fei explained to a beaming Ryo-ohki.
Ryoko and her were leaving to the airport, and while Basho carried the 
trunks to the awaiting limo, Fei was making sure everything else was in 
order.

“Bring me back a present please.”
Ryo-ohki said as she hugged Fei, and patter her cheek with her small hand.
Fei smiled and hugged her tighter.
“Sure I will Kitty. And when Miki is a bit older we will all go to the zoo 
and see the lions.”

“Ryo-ohki wants to see the tigers Fei.” Ryo-ohki explained herself in first 
person as Ryoko was walking in with Miki in her arms.

“Cat. I want to go see the tigers. Yes please?”
Ryo-ohki asked her sister.

“Yes ma’am but not today. Perhaps later.” Ryoko frowned inwardly as Ryo-ohki 
pouted and sat down on the breakfast table chair with a huff. Crossing her 
arms across her chest and twisting her mouth shut. Fei took little Miki and 
went of in search of Serla.

“Come give me a kiss baby.” Ryoko said as she opened her arms to Ryo-ohki.
Ryo-ohki shook her head and sank in deeper in the seat, barely even 
blinking.

“Don’t be mad at me Kitty. I have to go, and I thought you were behind me on 
this. I thought we were a team.” Ryoko said with a sigh as she sat down next 
to her furious Ryo-ohki.

Ryo-ohki’s posture soften a bit, but she was still grumbling meows here and 
there under her breath.

Ryoko leaned in closer to listen and with one quick swoop had a laughing 
Ryo-ohki in her arms. Of course, Ryoko knew that Kitty loved to be tickled…

After a few summersaults in the air and hanging upside down while being 
swirled around the room, Ryo-ohki lost her foul mood and gave her big sister 
a huge ‘good luck’ hug.

“That’s better my little Kitty.”

“I will be bored by myself.”
Ryo-ohki explained to her sister as both sat down to catch their breaths, 
Ryo-ohki on her sister’s lap.

“But with Fei and I gone… who other than you can take care of the baby?”
Ryo-ohki’s eyes opened wide and her hand went straight to her mouth in 
surprise.

“But Ryoko, I am baby too. Who will take care of me?”
Ryoko smiled as she noticed Ryo-ohki’s act, and acknowledged that she just 
wanted some pampering.

“You a baby! Well… To tell you the truth I had confused you with another 
mature, lovely little girl I knew… but since you said you’re a baby, I’ll 
take your word for it.”

Ryoko had been talking much like she would to a room full of people, giving 
the speech the importance it deserved. Ryo-ohki was sitting there, with a 
pleased grin on her face, happy with being the topic of such an important 
speech.

“Okay, since you’re a baby Kitty, you will need some diapers.” Ryo-ohki 
froze in place.
“And I will need to change your diet. No more carrot pancakes in the morning 
for a baby… You will eat that tasteless, yucky green goop that all true 
babies eat.”

Ryo-ohki stuck her tongue out in disgust. She had tried some of Miki’s food 
while no one was looking and had spit it right out. It tasted between dirt 
and more dirt. Absolutely awful.

Ryoko spied her reaction on the corner of her eyes and smiled.
* My baby. *

“And most urgent, I will have to go to the preschool I had planned to take 
the grown up little girl I though was you, and I will have to let the 
teacher know she will sadly not be coming. And I am sure she will be very 
disappointed, she was looking forward to meeting you. She told me so and 
everything.”

Ryo-ohki’s jaw at this time could reach the floor, with all the surprise she 
felt.
Ryoko had planned the preschool thing in secret, wanting it to be a 
surprise.

As Ryoko pretended to sigh in disappointment Ryo-ohki called out.

“No! Cat! I’m a good girl. No baby.”
She stuck her hands out and turned her head from side to side as if proving 
to Ryoko she held no baby in her pockets.
“See!!! No baby here. Only good girl. She leaned in closer to Ryoko and 
winked . “That’s me.”

Ryoko couldn’t contain her act any longer and gave her little sister an 
immense hug.

“Oh my Kitty. I will miss you.”

“Meow.”

“I will be back before you know it, and we’ll go get you enrolled in that 
school and go see the tigers. What do you say Kitty?”

“Meow!”

The front door opened and an a voice called out impatiently, “Catara! Let’s 
go! We’ll miss the plane.”

It was Matobi, and Ryoko could hear him impatiently tap his foot on the hard 
wooden floors of the foyer. Waiting for her to appear.

“Alright baby. Time for me to go. I want you to be a good girl for me and to 
take care of the house. You know Serla and Basho are a little loose in the 
head to actually take care of themselves, mush less you and Miki.”
Ryoko joked to Ryo-ohki who could not contain her tears.
Ryoko gently caressed her face, drying the tears as they fell from her sad 
amber eyes.

“You know Kitty? If my eyes are anything like yours, then I know why people 
make such a big deal about them. You look beautiful baby.”
That comment was enough for Ryo-ohki to quit crying, but to compensate she 
blushed and hid her face on Ryoko’s shoulder.

“I’ll call you every day, so make sure Basho doesn’t leave the phone of the 
hook okay? And make sure Serla feeds Miki the baby food the doctor gave us, 
not her concoctions.”
Ryo-ohki nodded at  everything in agreement.
Ryoko let her down on the kitchen table and continued with glossy eyes.

“And remember I love ya baby. Okay?”

Ryo-ohki nodded and sniffed. Ryoko also sniffed and began to walk to the 
door.

“I’ll call you tonight okay? Take care Kitty, and if you need anything, just 
call the cell phone Basho gave me okay. I left the number posted on the 
fridge, on the night table and on the television?”

“Meow. Bye Cat. Bring me a big, huge present!” Ryo-ohki called from the 
doorway with Serla and a gurgling Miki in her arms.

Ryoko grinned and nodded as Matobi shut the door and both entered the limo. 
Fei was already inside, adjusting her makeup nervously.

Ryoko almost gasped as she noticed a familiar shadow on the front seat.

“Ichima? Is that you?”
The sliding window between the front and back seats was up, so he could not 
hear a word. Fei answered her question as she puckered her lips in front of 
her pocket mirror.

“Yeah. He called in Serla-san last night. Wanting to go with us to Tokyo and 
be our bodyguard. Isn’t that thoughtful of him?”

“Why does that man never come to me first? Besides why in the world do we 
need a bodyguard?”
Fei shrugged and both looked at Matobi who was dozing of on Ryoko’s 
shoulder.

“What?”

Ryoko glared at the painter and asked again.
“Why does Ichima think we need a bodyguard in Tokyo?”

“Well Fei doesn’t but you do. I agreed to let run an immense add campaign 
for the museum. They want to renovate their image for the new generations or 
whatever, and they wanted to use my paintings as the main pitch. Of course 
they are a big hit, and basically all the people worth knowing will be at 
the premiere tonight. They all want to meet my geisha.”
Matobi had started speaking with a matter-of-fact voice but quickly changed 
to pride and finally to a meek whisper. If Ryoko had not been born with her 
amazing ears, then she would have thought he mumbled those last words 
instead of saying ‘my geisha’.

“It’s true Cat. Mayuri-san showed me some of Tokyo’s gossip columns and your 
mentioned in everyone! They voted that you and Matobi are the best couple of 
the year!”

Ryoko, furious at the both of them raised her hands to stop Fei from 
talking.

“Why the hell didn’t you tell me anything Fei! And you!” Ryoko flashed 
Matobi a death stare that made him sink back further in the seat.

“Who gave those stupid people the impression we were together?”

Matobi shifted uncomfortably and swallowed quickly.
“I…. Uh… I kind of didn’t deny the rumors when the asked me Catara.”
He was looking at his hands and his shoulders slumped.

*No wonder Ichima wanted to come with us. But hell! He should have said 
something, they all should have, especially Fei. *

“I’m sorry Cat-san. Mayuri thought that if we were to have told you then you 
would have gotten all nervous and have refused to come.”

Her eyes were watery and the tenderness that Ryoko had identified with when 
they had first met was back in full force. Ryoko forgave her at once.

“It’s okay Fei.” She took Fei’s hand I hers. “Bur from now on, you tell me 
everything okay? Deal?”
She stuck out her hand, and a relived Fei shook it with glee. “Deal.”

“As for you, don’t talk to me Matobi, unless you have cleared this little 
misunderstanding. I am a geisha and we don’t ‘go out’ , we have damna, and 
your not mine.”

She rested her hand on Matobi’s thigh to downplay the harshness of her 
words. It worked like a charm for before they knew it, all three of them 
were laughing gaily, on their way to Tokyo.

****************************************


“Hello? Oh hi Tenchi! Are you coming back for the weekend?”

“No Sasami I can’t. I promised Kukune and Takumi that I would go with them 
to an exposition tonight.”

There was silence at the other end of the phone line, and Tenchi frowned at 
how reserved Sasami had gotten over the past year.

“Okay Tenchi. I… who did you want to talk to?”

“I called to see if you guys wanted to come? We could go out to eat or 
something afterwards. What do you say Sasami?”

“Oh! Hold on sec.”

Tenchi heard muffled voices as if Sasami had placed her hand over the phone 
receiver.

“Tenchi?”

“Yeah? When are you coming?”

“I.. we can’t come, I’m sorry.”

“Oh, you already had plans to do something else? What about Ayeka?”

“She can’t come either Tenchi. We.. We are doing something all weekend.”

“What?”

“Uhh.. Just stuff you know. Stuff.”
Sasami sounded close to tears and Tenchi decided to let it drop. He couldn’t 
force them to come if Ayeka didn’t want to.

“Is Ayeka there?”

“Yes, she’s right… oh no uhh.. she went .. to funaho.”

“Alright, well I already talked to Kyone and Mihoshi and they are coming 
tonight. If you change your minds, just drop on over before nine okay?”

“Oh they’re going!? I wish I could go too.”

Tenchi’s frown got larger. “What do you mean Sasami. You can come. Just tell 
Ayeka to do whatever you’re doing some other time.”

There was more silence and finally she answered, “No I’m sorry Tenchi. I 
can’t.”

“Has Washu appeared yet?”

“No, we haven’t heard a single squeak from her lab in over two months now,
and the door won’t open. I hope she’s alright.”

“Don’t worry Sasami, she’s fine. Don’t forget she’s the smartest scientist 
in the universe.”

“When are you coming home?”

“Sasami, I barely finished my first year.” Tenchi replied with a sigh. “At 
least I have three more to go, but I have told you, whenever you want, you 
come here and live with me. Also Ayeka. You both could come.”

“Okay. I.. I gotta go. Take care.”

“Okay Sasami. And tell Ayeka I miss talking to her. And that if she doesn’t 
want to see me, let me at least see you.”

“Oh Tenchi, Ayeka … she’s just sad about Ryo- ”

“Yeah I know Sasami, but she can’t hide forever.”

“Bye.”

“Bye.”

********

“Are they coming Tenchi?”

Tenchi set the phone down lost in thought.
“No. They have other stuff to do.”

Kukune felt the anger in his voice and sighed inwardly. He always acted like 
this after he called his family. From what little information Tenchi had 
revealed to them here and there, someone close to him had runaway. And by 
the way Tenchi’s voice got hoarse, Kukune guessed Tenchi blamed himself for 
it. And now, after he was finally coming out of his shell, his family 
changed from calling everyday, to avoiding his own calls home.
She didn’t understand at all, but hopefully the exhibition tonight would 
take his mind of his problems. Two of his friends were coming, it might be a 
fun night after all.

*************

“Takumi! Get the door! I’m still in the shower!”
Kukune yelled as the doorbell kept ringing and nobody bothered to answer it.

“Okay! Okay! I’m coming, hold your horses.”
Takumi said to himself as he unlocked and opened the door.

“Hello! You must be Takumi-san. How are you?”
Mihoshi gave him a hug and entered the apartment as if she had been living 
there for years.

Takumi a bit dazed, turned to greet an embarrassed Kyone who only shook her 
head in apology.
“Hello. Sorry for Mihoshi, she’s not all there.”
Takumi laughed but felt alarmed by Kyone’s quiet serious tone and facial 
expression.

“Please come in.. I didn’t catch you name.”

“Kyone.”

“Yes, please come in, I’ll go get Tenchi.”
He left to the inside of the apartment while Mihoshi changed television 
stations, looking for something interesting to watch.

“Mihoshi!” Kyone hissed at her partner. “Behave yourself!”


“Hey girls! I’m glad you made it.”
Tenchi was visibly ecstatic to see his old friends. He thought it might turn 
out to be an awkward evening, since he hadn’t seen them in months now, but 
the only thing he felt was happiness.

“Oohh. Tenchi you look so handsome with that turtle neck on! And those 
jeans, could they be any tighter?” Mihoshi paid Tenchi a compliment and 
surprisingly out of the three, Kyone was the only one with a serious blush 
at her cheeks.

“Thanks Mihoshi. You guys want anything to drink?”

Kyone shook her head and looked around the loft.
“This place is amazing. It’s filled with paintings on every wall.”
She got up to examine the nearest wall, which indeed was filled with 
paintings by the three talented artist living there.

“Which one’s yours Tenchi?” Mihoshi asked.

Tenchi hid his hands in his pockets and pointed with his head to a painting 
of a beautiful winter landscape. The most prominent feature was an immense  
frozen lake, and a flock of duck circling around it. There were also two 
majestic mountains in the background.

“You did this?” Kyone asked, clearly impressed.

“Those mountains look like they’re hugging each other.” Mihoshi giggled.

“Ready to go you guys?” Takumi excitedly clapped his hands and put on his 
coat with Kukune in tow.

“Hi. I’m Kukune. You must be Kyone and Mihoshi. Nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you.”
Kyone smiled and Mihoshi nodded in agreement.

“Everybody ready?” Takumi asked as they turned of the lights.
He whispered with a hint of concern to Kukune, “Are you sure you want to 
come? How does your head feel? Is it still hurting?”

“Of course I’m going honey! And don’t be so worried I’m fine, it was just a 
tiny headache and I already took my pill and everything, now lets go before 
we are really late!”

As they all forced themselves to fit in Tenchi’s tiny car – Nobuyuki had 
bought it for him last summer – Kukune agreed to sit on Takumi’s lap.

“I like this car Tenchi.” Takumi said with a pleased smile on his face. “I 
was planning for us to go to dinner first, but it’s already nine thirty and 
if we take any longer they might not let us in.”

“But honey, don’t we have reserved tickets?” Kukune asked.

“Yeah, but this painter has been getting a lot of hype and the door men 
might want to be paid a little ‘extra’ to let us in. With or without 
tickets.”

“That’s illegal! We could have them arrested for even thinking it, right 
Kyone?”

“Remember we are not earth police… We can’t do a thing without revealing our 
identities.” Kyone whispered in Mihoshi’s ear.

“Oh right.”

Takumi and Kukune were completely perplexed by Tenchi’s two friends.

“I just hope tonight is not a total waste of time.”
Tenchi said absent mindedly as they were on their way to the museum.


*Tymilo looks good with black. But everything looks good with black, and 
probably all the women will be wearing black. I want something original. Ug! 
This is so hard! *

Ryoko stormed around her Tokyo apartment in a daze like state. Barely 
looking at the kimono laid out for her to choose. She was in a silk, pink 
robe with tiny fish embroidered on the sleeves edges. Her hair was tied back 
in a loose bun and her face was bare.
Ryoko picked up one of the kimono resting on her bed and looked it over.
* Should I really wear a kimono tonight? If I want to go incognito, then a
kimono is definitely not the way to go.*

Ryoko picked the obi belonging to the kimono and ran her fingers on its rich 
silk.
* But then again, Matobi said Tokyo geisha would escort some generals 
tonight. If I wear one of the wigs I borrowed for Homino I shouldn’t be too 
recognizable.*

She laid the kimono and obi gently on the bed and walked to the mirror, and 
the table next to it which was were the wigs were located.

“I know what I’ll do.” She said to herself absentmindedly. “I’ll do my hair, 
and then put the black wig over it. So I can still observe people without 
being noticed, and if I get bored then I can take it of!”
Ryoko smiled at herself in the mirror.

* I can barely recognize the demon anymore. * Her smile got even bigger.

When they had registered in the apartment, Ryoko bought from a stand outside 
an arm full of magazines and went directly to her room. There she searched 
for her name or picture. Much like Fei had said, she was in every one, but 
they called her ‘Golden Geisha’ followed by a close up picture of one of 
Matobi’s paintings.
And the simple fact that one had really seen her, made her that much more 
interesting to talk about.
In one article, they talked about Kyoto and how it was suspected she had 
giving birth to a girl a few years back.
“Ryo-ohki.” Ryoko said under her breath.
And of course the most regular gossip was the romance between her and the up 
and coming artist Matobi.

To stop the supposed romance, Ryoko had decided she would arrive at the 
museum in a separate car. Matobi had made a huge scene, but Ryoko stood firm 
in her decision. She was glad Ichima had come along, for she really did need 
a person looking out for her at the gala. With her unusual cyan hair and 
amber eyes, everyone and anyone recognized her. She had been forced to wear 
a big hat and huge sunglasses bought at the airport gift shop, just to get 
in the cab!

* Who would have thought I would be mobbed by people because they wanted to 
meet me, not kill me?* She laughed and had to make a conscious effort to not 
let her eyes cry out in happiness.

The door opened and Fei walked in with her makeup and hair ready. 
“Homino-san is waiting in the living room for you.”

“Wow Fei, you look beautiful!”

“You think? Isn’t the hair a bit much?” Fei asked as she delicately felt her 
hair with her hand.

Ryoko smiled and shook her head. She picked up the chosen peach-split wig 
and walked out the door.
Homino had been staying in Tokyo since her mizuage, and Ryoko had gotten 
another up and coming stylist to help her in Kyoto. Yet for the museum gala, 
Homino had insisted he be the one to help her get ready. He was even the one 
who rented an apartment for them in the posh side of Tokyo.

The apartment was a modern Japanese styled with a touch of an Italian villa 
here and there, that Homino had specifically chosen for Ryoko. According to 
him, the soft, eggshell colors made Ryoko seem small and delicate. Plus it 
added light to the apartment and went well with her alabaster skin and eye 
color.

Homino himself owned an apartment just two floors down. He had also reserved 
the penthouse for any parties Ryoko decided to hold while in Tokyo. When 
Homino had told her all this, Ryoko was shocked.

    “How much exactly is this going to cost Homino?”

“Not a single yen. You see, the building knows the power of free 
advertisement, and as long as the press knows were you are staying in Tokyo, 
the building will get free advertisement in the best selling magazines, and 
added words of praise at accommodated such a famous geisha.

“Really?”

“Of course Catara. And not to mention I get my name thrown in there from 
time to time. He smiled pleased at himself as Ryoko sat there dumbfounded at 
how her life had changed so dramatically over the past year.

* I can’t believe this as all for free! And just because I posed for a few 
paintings! Before I used to work my butt off to charm people, and now I 
don’t do a thing and they all want to meet me. How utterly bizarre.*

Before walking through the front door of her apartment, at the service desk, 
was a box full of envelopes all
addressed to : ‘Golden Geisha Catara Sokumobu’ , and asked for
her presence in a gala, dedication, or party somewhere.
As Homino and a jealous Matobi looked over the stack of letters, Homino said 
most were from very influential men in deed.
The exquisite calligraphy and seals of family name, were from century old 
families of extreme wealth and honor.
He also explained to Ryoko what the color on the seal meant. For instance, 
red meant samurai. Dark red meant a samurai working directly for the 
emperor. A yellow seal meant dignitaries and politicians. The black seal 
meant century old family names.
    “ And there’s a hand full more, but it’s time to get ready. Who’s going 
first?”

“Let Fei go first, I still have to decide what I am going to wear.” Ryoko 
said.

******** **********

“Look at all these people! Is this place packed or what?” Takumi exclaimed 
as Tenchi gave the valet his keys and stuffed the ticket in his back pocket. 
It was no use looking for a free parking space, they were all filled up.

As the troupe made it’s way to the entrance, Tenchi observed how dressed up 
everyone was. Even the press waiting at the main entrance were wearing dress 
pants and formal shirts.
“Uhh guys? I think we came too casual, they might not let us in.”

They all stopped to examine one another. All the girls were alright by 
formal standards. Kyone was wearing black dress pants and a silk blue shirt 
tied at the waist with a sash. Her hair was hanging loosely over one 
shoulder, and her makeup was natural but elegant.
Mihoshi was wearing a light pink dress and delicate mules of the same color. 
Her curly blond hair remained ever the same.
Kukune wore a black dress which Takumi had given her on her birthday. It was 
tight fitting with spaghetti straps and revealed quite a bit of leg.
The guys were what presented the problem. Takumi was wearing dark jeans and 
a beige sweater. Similarly, Tenchi was also wearing dark jeans and a black 
turtle neck.

“I don’t think you guys have anything to worry about. You’ll get in.” Kukune 
confidently stated as they began walking.

“Why are you so sure Kukune?” Tenchi asked confused.

“Have you seen the way these women are looking at you? At you both? I don’t 
know, but there is something about well built guys with jeans that drive 
women crazy.”

“Is that so honey? In that case you must be psychotic by now, with me being 
the handsome man that I am.”
Takumi stood up taller and mimicked some modeling poses for his laughing 
friends.

“Sure Takumi, your gorgeous.” Kukune teased, while she held her head briefly 
with her hand.

******* *********

“I’m nervous Fei. Why are all these people here?”
Ryoko said as she peered out of the car window.

“They are here to meet you and Matobi. Don’t worry about them, they are just 
a bunch of busy bodies who will be content if you just share a few words 
with them.”

“A few words! I don’t even want to be here, much less talk to them. How 
about if we go home? I bet Miki and Ryo-ohki are driving Serlla and Basho 
insane.”

Fei laughed, “I bet they are, but you are still not going anywhere. Besides, 
if you are foolish enough to waste this opportunity you might never have 
another one like it. Do you know how hard it is for a Kyoto geisha to 
migrate to Tokyo? Almost impossible with all the rivalry between the 
districts. I bet all those Tokyo geisha are positively green with envy.”
Fei said with a grin as she pointed to one of those Tokyo geisha make her 
way to the museum.

“Yeah.” Agreed Ryoko as they both examined the geisha. The attire was normal 
enough. With a dazzling kimono and the obi to match. The difference came in 
not the look of the Kyoto and the Tokyo geisha but their want to attract the 
emperor’s attention. The emperor had an estate in each city, and it was the 
geisha’s job to keep his attention occupied in the city of their choosing. 
So far it had been well over twenty years that the emperor recided in Tokyo. 
And the sudden arrival of Geisha Catara from Kyoto, was a threat.

“Fei, who was the one that kept the emperor in Kyoto?”

“Don’t you know Cat?”
Ryoko narrowed her eyes, “No I don’t, if I did I wouldn’t be asking.”

Fei settled in more comfortably in the car seat.
“This geisha had skin made of gold and dark black hair up to her waist, 
which danced with the rhythm of her hips as she walked. She came from an 
unknown land of flying carpets and - ”

“Serla! It was Serla!” Ryoko said in amazement.

“The one and only. But really Cat. You should have let me finish my story.”
Fei said with a pout.

“Okay geisha we are here.” Ichima stated from the front seat

“Is this the side entrance Ichima-san?”

“Yes Catara, just like you requested.”
Ryoko nodded in approval and turned to Fei.

“Okay this is my stop. Now the driver will go back around and drop you of in 
the main entrance. This will be your introduction to geisha society, so 
remember to hold your head high and only nod to the press. Do not talk to 
them okay? Maybe even bow your head a little, but no talking.”

“But Cat. Why don’t you walk with me?”
Fei asked as she held Ryoko’s hand tightly.

“For one because if I do, my whole ‘spy on the people’ game will be over 
before it begun, and the most important, because you need to be seen by 
yourself. Remember what Serla told us? First impressions are very important, 
and I don’t think I will help you any by being there. The press will 
instantly group you to me forever. And I want you to be your own geisha. 
Okay?”

Fei nodded and swallowed nervously as Ryoko gave her a tiny hug.

“Now don’t touch your face or you will ruin your make up.”
Fei nodded and Ryoko closed the door.
Ichima remained with Fei to walk along with her as she made her entrance. He 
had agreed, with Ryoko’s solemn promise they would all meet up once inside.

                                  * * *

* This place look beautiful!* Ryoko observed in awe at her surroundings.

The museum with its marble walls and high ceilings was the most majestic 
building Ryoko had ever scene, on earth at least. Not that she had seen a 
lot, but in Kyoto a handful of powerful men had invited her to this or that 
all over Japan, but this building was by far the best.

* And I’m the main attraction. * Ryoko thought with glee as she roamed the 
museum’s endless halls.

“Do you think that’s her real hair color?”

“Are you kidding? Who knows what kind of strange things these geisha do 
behind close doors.”

Ryoko paused herself to catch that bit of conversation as two snotty looking 
women looked over the program and talked about her.
Ryoko decided to stand as close to them as possible and opted to act like 
she was observing the painting next to them.
The two women turned and stared. It’s true Ryoko was wearing a wig, and she 
was careful to keep her gaze on the floor so as not to be recognized in the 
eyes, but she was still dressed as an exquisite geisha, and the two ladies 
had just indirectly insulted her.

Keeping her eyes on the floor and with the softest tone of voice she had, 
she turned and said, “Ex’cuze me ladies. I fo’got me bag of condoms in de 
car. Would you be so kin an spare some of yours?”

The two women looked at Ryoko’s open hand, looked at each other and speedily 
left that hall of the museum.
* Good Riddens! *
Ryoko thought to herself.

*********      ***********         ***************

“You were right Kukune, we entered without any problems. Tenchi said to 
Kukune as they skipped the long line to enter the museum. As they passed the 
people who had probably been waiting since the morning, all the group could 
do is avoid eye contact.

“Look at the geisha!” Mihoshi screamed with delight as they entered the main 
hall.

It was true, a crowd of people were just standing around talking to one 
another as waiters maneuvered throughout the mass to offer champagne and 
chocolate covered strawberries.

“What are the strawberries for Tenchi?”
Mihoshi asked.

“They are supposed to make the champagne’s taste magnify, and the chocolate 
to fight its sour flavor on the tongue.” Tenchi explained as he took a glass 
for himself and his friends.

“No thanks Tenchi.” Kukune said.

Takumi observed his girlfriend for a few moments, and said, “Okay, so where 
are we going first?”

“Well I think the geisha exhibit is going to open when the artist comes, so 
we could go see the other halls.” Kyone observed as she asked for a program 
from one of the waiters.

“How about the Romantic period? There’s a Rembrant I’ve been dying to see 
that’s on loan from Florence.”
Takumi shouted above all the noise, as he led the group to the appointed 
hall.

With all the confusion nobody noticed Mihoshi get lost in the crowd.

                              * * *

* Oohh! Look at all these people. They look so elegant. And those women with 
the white faces! I want to be one too!  *

Mihoshi got lost in the glitter and the sparkle of the Japan’s richest 
families. She would ooh and ahh and thankfully not notice the looks of 
contempt they offered her.

“Can I have more champagne please?” She asked a waiter with a huge smile.

“Here you go Ms.”

“Excuse me? Do you know where…”

* Where did Takumi say they were going? I think the Egyptian hall. *

“Where the Egyptian hall is?”

“Yes. It is four halls to your left.” The waiter, with his hands, full 
pointed with his head before being swept up in the crowd.

* Ok four halls. Four halls to my left or his left? I guess his left so it’d 
be my left. Or.. He was standing to my left, so it’d be my front. Oh man! 
I’ll just walk around. How big can this place be anyway? *

With a shrug of her shoulders and a sip of her fourth glass of champagne, 
Mihoshi decided to simply enjoy herself with all the pretty faces and 
paintings.

“I could paint like that.” Mihoshi said to herself as she studied a Matisse.

“It’s simple really. Just get some paint and whoosh!” She started to mimic a 
paintbrush with her hands and went around the room. Waving her hands around 
while laughing to herself.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

“Ouch My head!”

Mihoshi rubbed her head with her hand, as she hit something hard.

“I’m sorry, I didn’t see you… Ryoko?
Mihoshi squinted and gasped.

“Ryoko! It’s you!”

****************              *****************

“Takumi my head ….. it feels.”
Kukune couldn’t finish the rest of her sentence and her face contorted in 
pain.

“Where are your pills honey? In your purse?”
Takumi worriedly dug through her purse only to find an empty bottle.

“Damn!” He hissed under his breath.
Kukune was turning red and her breathing was ragged.

“I’ll go get the car and meet you up front.” Tenchi said as he ran to the 
entrance and get his keys from a valet.

“Where’s Mihoshi?” Kyone asked herself.

As Takumi helped Kukune along the halls, Kyone lagged a little ways behind, 
looking for her partner.

“Takumi which hospital are you going to?”

“Yamito.” Takumi said in a hoarse voice.

“Okay.” Kyone nodded and checked Kukune over.

“I was.. well I took some courses in medicine. Whatever is happening to her 
is happening quickly. But she should be okay if it progresses in this pace. 
About twenty minutes. I’ll stay behind to look for Mihoshi and meet up with 
you at Yomito.”

Takumi nodded nervously while glancing at his love.

“Don’t worry. She has medicine so whatever she has can be controlled. Just 
get her to the hospital quick. She’ll be okay.” Kyone gave Takumi a 
comforting look and made sure they got in the car and drove off safely 
before going of to look for her airhead partner.

*God Mihoshi! This is not the time for you to loose the half brain you 
have!*


Notes:

   Just something kind of related. I am building a site for any works you 
might have, Tenchi related or other wise. If you would like your posted 
there mail me your story. I guarantee it will be scene by people who 
normally would not get to read your work. How? (smiles shrewdly) I got 
connections.

Anyway take a look. That’s also the place where I’ll post my stories first.

Oh and one more thing. I recently watched tenchi forever, and here is my 
question. If Haruna could have somehow survived the other world (humor me) 
then would Tenchi have stayed with her?
He did say plenty of times he loved her, and didn’t say a word in the 
contrary.
I would love for you to answer in my new message forum. (To give it some 
kind of purpose, poor thing) but if no, then just something to ponder….
