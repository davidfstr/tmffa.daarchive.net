Well, I've finally got my room fixed. Those writers can do a lot of damage.
Instead of MSTing stuff, like I usually do, I've decided to try to live a
day in their
shoes and write my own [insert trumpet fanfare here] Tenchi Fic! I decided
to
throw my hand-made character, The Mirror Knight, into the fray (and yes,
that
means I'm selfishly putting myself into the story, forgive me). Enjoy!. I've
read a lot of fics with people putting
their own characters in it. I hope I've tip-toed around them. This takes
place
sometime after the first OVA, but before the second. Thanks for reading!

Tenchi Muyo! : A Lone Shard Dreaming , Intro
By: Rick "The Mirror Knight" Everts
Tenchi stuff owned by AIC, Pioneer. Mirror Knight (Mirror Knight, The Shard,
Xie) stuff is owned by ME.
May the great and mighty lords of AIC and Pioneer decide not to sue me.

Some people say that in our world, there are "pockets" of other space in our
own.
Rips in space/time. They can be tiny or large, be wide or thin. Most of
these "pockets"
suck things from our world to another, perhaps the best known being the
Bramuda
Triangle. There are some, however, that spit things up from other worlds to
ours.
What if both of these just happen to exist in your college dorm room desk?
If
you're 18 year-old Rick Everts, probably this...

Rick: I HATE computer programming!

[Enter college dorm room with Rick at a desk. A ton of flowcharts, graph
paper, coding sheets and other assorted papers are piled on his desk and on
the floor. He's working on a coding sheet. Rick looks at his clock on the
desk.]

Rick: 10:00 P.M.? And I only got THIS MUCH DONE!?!?! I HATE COMPUTER
PROGRAMING!!!

[Rick tosses his coding sheets aside. He opens drawer and pulls out drawing
paper and starts drawing.]

Rick:  Ah, a simple escape from a mundane world. [To himself]: "Man, I
really wanted to be an artist, why did I go into programming!?

[Rick looks around the room for something to draw. He sees the first Tenchi
OVA on his recliner. He sketches a couple of hours and cfeel dead when I get
up, I'm finishing this!

[Rick digs in his desk for ink and a pen. He finds odds and ends, such as
toothpicks, pop cans, napkins, poker chips, rabbits feet, and other stuff
that isn't his.

Rick: Damn roomate. Wish he'd keep his trash outta my desk!

[Rick finds a pen and a bottle of ink. The ink bottle has odd runes on it.
Rick doesn't notice. About an hour later, Rick finishes.]

Rick: Perfect! My finest work. I even got the shading right. [Rick looks at
the clock.] Woah! 1:30! I had better get to bed!

[Rick looks at the drawing, putting his head on his hands. Rick's eyelids
start to droop as he continues to look at the drawing.]

********************************************************************

[It's another typical day at the Masaki household. Tenchi wakes up to the
noise of Ayeka and Ryoko arguing.]

Ayeka: Ryoko, Lord Tenchi would not want the first vision in the morning to
be you!

Ryoko: What, you think he'd want to see your snotty face?

Ayeka: WHAT!?

[Tenchi comes out of his room before the two could cause serious property
damage.]

Tenchi: Good morning, girls!

[The hatred in the girls eyes disappeared and was replaced with joy as they
turned to face Tenchi.]

Ayeka: Good morning, Lord Tenchi!

[Ryoko flys over to Tenchi and put her arms around him.]

Ryoko: Tenchi! Good morning!

[Tenchi's face turns a mild shade of red.]

Tenchi: [Nervously] Ummm...Ryoko...

Ayeka: Ryoko, remove your arms from Lord Tenchi at once!

Ryoko: Yeah, and who's gonna make me? You?!

[From downstairs, Sasami calls.]

Sasami: Tenchi! Ayeka! Ryoko! Breakfast is ready!!

[Tenchi, using the interruption to escape from Ryoko's grasp, heads
downstairs.]

Tenchi: Boy, am I hungry! I can't wait to eat!

[Ayeka and Ryoko glare at each other, promising each other to finish the
argument later.]

********************************************************************

[Rick is falling downward in a gray void. He opens his eyes and looks
around.]

Rick: [To himself]: Man, I hate these dreams. Just fall, fall, fall, then
before I hit bottom, I wake up with a jolt. Can't do anything about it even
I know if I'm dreaming. It makes me feel so helpless.

********************************************************************

[Breakfast starts at the Masaki home when everyone (except Washu, who's
working on something new) takes their respective spots.  There is some mild
conversation. Yosho reminding Tenchi about his training and his chores,
Mihoshi babbling about this and that, Nobuyuki saying he'll be out really
late tonight because of a deadline he has to meet, and Ryo-ohki miyaing for
some carrots. Nothing really out of place. That's when the "guest" dropped
in...]

********************************************************************

        [Rick can see the bottom of the void. It's Tenchi's dinner table.]

Rick: [To himself]: Huh?! Usually it's just a black mass. Why is it a table
with Japanese food on it?

*CRAASSSHHHH!*

Rick: [To himself]: HEY! I actually landed this time, but it didn't hurt!

[Rick raises his head from the bowl of
food it was currently in and looked around to see...]

Rick: [To himself]:Tenchi? Ayeka? Sasami? Ryo-ohki? Yosho? Mihoshi?
Nobuyuki?
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!?! Wait a minute....if  I see them to the
sides of me that means the person in front of me is either Washu, or...uh
oh.

[Rick looks forward and sees an angry Ryoko, who isn't very happy about Rick
destroying her meal.]

Rick: [To himself]: Oh GOD! Can I fall some more, please!?!

Rick: Hmmm...needs something else...I know!

[Another half hour of sketching later, and he adds his hand-made character,
the
Mirror Knight to Tenchi's group, Shard Buster sword in hand. He looks almost
like Rick, brown hair, blue eyes, average weight and height, and a blue
sapphire ring on his left hand. The only difference is that the Mirror
Knight's
hair is long on one side and just covers his right eye. Rick taps his ruby
high school class ring.]

Rick: [To himself]: Wish my aunt had listened when I asked for a sapphire
one.

[Rick adds Mirror Knight's enemy, Xie, with Kagato.  Xie is an ominous
figure. He looks like the Grim Reaper, except instead of a skeleton, Xie was
made up of shadows, his cloak obscuring all but his face, but instead
of a face, there is nothing but a small, dim light swirling in the shadows.]

now!)

Ryoko:  Who the heck ar

ÐÏà¡±áman, is my whole dream going to revolve around that drawing?)

Rick: See? Next time you should listen to the Greatest Scientific Mind in
the
Universe!

Tenchi: So, Little Washu, are you saying his ring  brought him here?

Washu: I don't think so...it doesn't have enough energy to bring a whole
person to a different universe. I'll need to run more experiments
to know exactly what did bring him here.

Rick: Oooooooh NO! You are NOT gonna experiment on ME!

Washu: [Gives Rick a hurt look.] Why not?

Rick: I know how you experiment! You're gonna...gonna..*cough!*
*cough!* [Goes into coughing fit]

Tenchi: Hey, are you all right?

Rick: Can't...*cough!*...throat...so dry..*cough! COUGH!!*

[Washu brings up her computer and starts scanning]

Washu: His body is extremely dehydrated, and it's getting worse.

Rick: Wha..?*COUGH! COUGH! COOOOOOUGH!*" [Ricks coughing gets worse, making
him double over.]

Washu: Quick, Ryoko! Carry him to my lab so I can help him!

Ryoko:Right. I don't want this guy to die without asking him how he knows
so much about us.

[Ryoko picks up Rick, who has fainted at this point, and follows Washu
into the lab.]

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Shaded Figure 1: Damn. Got to work on those side effects.

[The shaded figure is at writing desk, across the room is something that
resembles a TV.
On the TV is Rick being hooked up to an IV and monitor by Washu, while the
rest of the
Tenchi characters watch her. On the desk is a bunch of books, some blank,
some not. He's currently
writing in a partially blank book. Another shaded figure comes up beside
him. Although we can't
see the details, we can tell by the shadowed wings on its back that it isn't
quite human.]

Shaded Figure 2: I'll make a new potion formula right away. Do
you really think he can make your new work a masterpiece?"

Shaded Figure 1:No doubt. He's got quite a spirit and imagination, probably
one
of the best I've seen. [The sitting figure turns and faces the other
figure.] Yesss...he'll do quite nicely. Now, don't disturb me any more.
I must concentrate at the job at hand.

Shaded Figure 1: Yes sir.

[The winged figure leaves. The other figure turns to the TV again, and
starts writing]

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

[3 hours later in Washus lab, An unconciuos Rick is in a hi tech medical
bed, hooked
up to an IV and monitor]

Rick: Ughhh.. [Rick starts to wake up.] Man, whatta dream. [He looks
around, and notices he's hooked up to an IV and a monitor, and that
he's in the high-tech bed.] What the...!

Washu: Ahh..I see you FINALLY woke up!"

Rick: [Rick sits up] Little Washu? (Great, I'm still dreaming
and stuck in Washu's Lab!)

Washu: That ring's quite a little piece of work. [Washu steps out
from behind a machine.]  The fact that it is containing a dimensional flux
is
intriguing, but not only that, it's indestructible, even when exposed
to absolute zero, 10,500 degrees Celsius, and high gravity forces.

Rick: How do you know all that?

Washu: [smiling]  I did some experiments while you were sleeping.

Rick:  WHAAAT!?

Washu: Don't worry! I couldn't take the ring off, so I just did a
molecular scan and ran the data through a simulator.

Rick: Oh...hey, waitaminute! What do you mean you couldn't take my
ring off?"[Rick tugs on the ring. Try as he might, he couldn't tug it free.]
Why...(tug)...won't...(tug)...it come off?!

Washu: It seems some type of energy field is drawing it to your
skeleton, like a magnet.

Rick: Can you break it?

Washu: I haven't figured how to do that, but I have all the data I
need from you for now, and your body seems to have stabilized, so I'll let
you go for
the time being. I'll tell you when I can. [Washu presses a button on
the bed and the IV and monitor hookups withdraw themselves from Rick]

Rick: Thanks. Hey, what did happen to me?

Washu: Apparently, your body was suffering from accelerated
dehydration. I hooked you up to an IV, and you seem to be fiÜ¥e
Time to roll it into high gear! This is where the real story starts!
I'm gonna tell the story completely in third person now. Hope you
enjoy it! What? Yes, that's all I'm gonna say! Oh, wait. If you haven't
read the prologue you may want to before reading this.

Rick: "AHHHHHH!!!!" [ Rick scoots back and falls off the table in
fear. ]

Rick: (Oh, now I KNOW I'm dreaming!  I fall a few miles,
and just happen to land in Tenchi Muyo, right in Ryoko's breakfast!  I
guess I can wake up now!)

Ryoko:  Who the heck are you?!

[Rick looks at her fearfully. ]
Rick: Um....uh...Hi, I'm Rick...uh...sorry
about dropping in like this. I usually use the door."

[Tenchi is about to say something when Washu bursts out of her lab.]
Washu: Hey! There was a massive disturbance in space/time localized in here!
What
the heck is... wait a sec...who are you?"
[ Washu points at Rick.]

Ryoko: Some guy that just landed in my breakfast!

Yosho: Ryoko! You should have some respect for our guest!"
[Yosho helps Rick get off the floor.]  Now...Rick, was it? What brings you
to our home?

Rick: Umm...  (Well, if I'm not gonna wake up, I might as well play along
with it.) ...I don't know. I was sitting at my desk at
the college, and all of the sudden my head was in Ryoko's breakfast.

Ryoko: HEY! How do you know my name!?

Rick: (Crud.) Uh, well...um...

Ryoko: Where you spying on us?!

Rick: NO! No!  I'm...just...well...I...

[Washu grabs Rick's hand and passes a scanner over his
class ring.]

Rick: Wha..wha...wha...what are you doing!? [Rick yanks hand away.]

Washu: Oh, just conducting a test of the effects of
dimension hopping.

[Everyone (except Yosho) gives Washu confused looks.]

Tenchi: Dimension hopping?

Washu: Yes. It seems our visitor is either from another time, or, more
probable by his energy signature, a different universe altogether.

Mihoshi: Wow, neat!

Sasami: Another universe?

Rick: So? What does that have to do with my ring?

Washu: When my computer picked up a dimensional flux in here, I ran out of
my
lab to see what was going on. I conducted a few scans when you were
explaining yourself and I picked up a very small flux.

Rick: Inside my ring.

Washu: Inside your ring.

Rick: Look Washu...

Washu: That's LITTLE WASHU

Ryoko: I'd still like to now how he does that.

Rick: (Oops! Forgot about that.) Er...Little Washu...this is a plain ruby
class ring. There are no
tears, fluxes, or super photon energy pills contained in it.

[Everyone (except Yosho) gives Rick quizzical looks.]

Tenchi: A...what pill?.

Rick: [shakes his head] Never mind.

Washu: Heh, heh. You might wanna look at your ring. Last time I
checked, rubies are red, not blue.

Rick: What are you talking about? It's re...huh? [Rick looks at his ring.
Instead of a ruby, a blue sapphire sits. At the center of it, there is a
swirling mne now.
Probably just a side effect from dimension hopping.

Rick: Oh, that reminds me, can you send me back?

Washu: What?

Rick: You know. Back to my universe.

Washu: Welllll.... I haven't really started to work on that, [frowns] Ive
been a LITTLE busy keeping
your body stabialized, you know!

Rick: Er...sorry.

Washu: [smiles] Thats all right!  Im gonna start looking into it now.
Hows that?

Rick. Thank you.

Washu: Now what are you going to do?

Rick: Huh? What do you mean?

Washu: I mean, you're stuck in another universe. Where are you going
to go?"

Rick: Um...

Washu: I'm sure you can stay at the house.

Rick: Oh, ok! Cool! Where's the door?

Washu: [Points and door appears]  Right there. Oh, by the way, Ryoko
wants to ask you a few questions.

Rick: Ooooo...K [Rick opens and walks through the door]  (Oh, great. Just
what
I need. She probably still hasn't forgotten that I ruined her breakfast.
Wait
a minute...what do I care...this is just a dream. Of course...it's been
a pretty damn realistic one so far. I wonder if I really did...nah. No
way.)

[Washu watches Rick go through the door.]

Washu: (Interesting. Very interesting. The scans show him to be human in all
respects, but that ring he
has isn't made with any materials found any place in my databanks.)
[Washu brings up the information the microsensor was sending to her
computer.
She took the liberty to install it on Rick's ring while he was out cold. As
long as
Rick didn't look at his ring with a powerful microscope, he wont see it.]
He's from another universe, yet he seems to know an awful lot about us.
Oh, well. I'm sure my daughter will find him, and ask him a few questions
about
that.) [Washu gives a small chuckle.]

Rick: (Well, at least no one seems to be here, especially Ryoko.)
[He steps out of the lab door and closed it. There wasn't a sound in the
house, but Rick could her Sasami humming a little song outside.]
(Now, what do I do?)

[Sasami comes through the door(with Ryo-ohki behind her) carrying a bowl of
fruit.]

Sasami: Oh, hello Rick!

Rick: Um...hello Sasami!

[Sasami looks at Rick, puzzled, but decided to let it slide.]

Sasami: Are you feeling better?

Rick: Yes, thanks for asking.

Sasami: Do you want some fruit?

Rick: Sure, I'm starved!

[Sasami holds the bowl to Rick, who selects an apple. He bites into it,
and to his surprise, it tastes delicious.]

Rick: Thank you

Sasami: [giggles] Hey! I should go tell the others that you are awake!

mail order catalog.

Tenchi: I'd guess not.

[They reached the house. Ayeka is busy watering the flower
garden. She hears them approach and turns around.]

Ayeka: Hello Tenchi! I'm glad you're back! I see that Washu has released our
'guest'.

Rick: Yeah, for the time being. Could you tell me a good hiding spot in case
she wants to run a few more tests?" [Tenchi and Ayeka laughs.] (Good. Get in
good with most of the people in the house, and maybe they can back me up of
Ryoko goes ballistic.)

Rick: Well anyway, Id thought Id go see your grandpa and tell him about
the situation.

Tenchi: That sound like a good idea.

Rick: Right, then. See you later! [Rick starts back on the path to the
shrine steps when
he hears  a commotion behind him.]

Ayeka: Release Tenchi at once, monster woman!

Ryoko: What? Forget it. Just go and be a good little princess and water your
flowers.

Ayeka: You DARE give ME an order!?

Rick: [Watching from a distance.] (Well, if my dream is going to be a Tenchi
episode,
at least I'll get to watch them fight!) [Smiling, he takes a seat on
a nearby rock.]

Ryoko: Yeah! You might be a princess back on Jurai, but here, you can't boss
people around!
I can tell you anything I want!

Tenchi: Uhhhmmm...can we just go inside and talk this over?

Ayeka and Ryoko: NO! [The girls push Tenchi out of the way. Ayeka summons
her
logs, and Ryoko forms her energy blade.]

Rick: (...And let the battle commence. Hehheh.)

Ayeka: Get her!

[Her logs comply and try to zap Ryoko who teleports away. Ryoko throws a
couple of energy blasts at Ayeka. Ayeka puts up shield and they fizzle out.
The logs try to trap Ryoko
but she blackflips before the logs can get her. Tenchi is begging for the
girls to
calm down. Rick watches, and can barely suppress his laughter.]

Rick:  (No! I can't! I'm gonna...)

[Ayeka and Ryoko hear the sound of laughter. They immediately turn to see
who
it was, and both turn red with anger.]

Ayeka: AND WHAT, EXACTLY, IS SO FUNNY!?!"

[Rick stops laughing, goes wide eyed, and turns a few shades pale.]

Rick: Um....er..heh....I thought of something that I saw on
TV...hehe....um...it was very
funny....gotta go!!! [Rick immediately gets up and runs as fast as he
could.]

Ryoko: HEY! You're that guy that ruined my breakfast! Get back here!

[Rick looks behind him to see a very angry Ryoko swooping for him. Ryoko
just about grabs him when she disappears.]

Rick: Huh? (That means...oh,oh.)

[Rick looks forward and sees that he's running TOWARD Ryoko, who has
an evil little smile on her face. Rick skids to a halt, loses his balance
and falls
on his butt.]

Rick: [smiling nervously] Um, I don't suppose I could apologize?"

Ryoko: You could, but it won't do you any good. [Ryoko walks toward Rick,
pointing her energy blade at him. Rick scoots back quickly, only to back
into a tree.] Now. How do you know so much about us?

Rick: I don't know!! I just...just..

Ryoko: Yeah?

Rick: I just know.

Washu: Wrong answer!  [Ryoko prepares for a swing.  Rick puts up his hands
in a defensive
measure.]

Rick:  (Well, at least the dream will end.) [As Ryoko begins her
swing, a brilliant light forms in Rick's hands.]

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

[Washu is busy working on her new invention, when a series of alarms go
off.]

Washu: [Jumping up in surprise] "Waugghhh!" [She summons her computer to
bring up
the micro-scanner information.] What!? Activity of the dimension flux has
gone up 15.232571 percent!
[She studies the other information popping up on the monitor.]
Amazing! It appears he's actually using PSI energy to widen the flux! [Washu
burst out
of her seat and out the door] I've gotta see what's going on!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

*ZZSSHSHSOOOCHHH!!!*

[Energy crackles as Ryoko's energy blade hits a newly formed sword either.
He seems nice enough, though.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

[Tsunami looks through Sasami's eyes as she watched the young man go
out the door. Tsunami knew how he knew all about the group.]

Tsunami: (Odd....I recognize what dimension he's from, but the ring...I'm
going
to keep a close eye on him)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Rick: (OK...now to get my bearings. Maybe I should talk to Yosho...he's a
level-headed guy, and less prone to throw energy blasts at me.  Where's the
shrine from the house?) [Rick sees
the path leading to the long series of steps. He started to follow it when
he notices
Tenchi in the distance, struggling with a very large basket of carrots.]

Tenchi: [ Sets the basket of carrots down and wipes his forehead.]
(Phew...these should
feed Ryo-ohki, at least for a couple a days)

Rick: Need a hand?

Tenchi: Oh...Rick, was it? I'm glad to see that you recovered.

Rick: Yeah, I'M glad I survived being Washu's lab rat!  So, do you want
help, or do
you want to drag that snack for Ryo-ohki back yourself?

Tenchi: All right.

Rick: [Takes one side of the basket with both hands]  (Damn, I know that
cabbit
eats a lot a carrots, but actually CARRYING them, geeeshh!)

Tenchi: Say, Rick. Do you mind if ask you a question?

Rick: Shoot.

Tenchi: How do you know all about us?

Rick: I don't know...as soon as I saw you guys, your names just popped in my
head.

Tenchi: Oh.

Rick: (Well, playing dumb is working so far.  I wonder if Ryoko will be a in
Rick's hands.
His sword is katana-like, with a very reflective surface. The handle is gold
and is encrusted
with blue sapphires. Rick looks wide-eyed at his hands.]

Rick: Th....th...th....the Shard Buster?!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Shaded Figure 1: "Hmmmm....maybe that's to much like the first
episode?...eh...oh well...what
should he do next?" [He ponders for a minute. Looking at TV, showing Rick
looking wide-eyed at his hands, then Ryoko, and back again.] Ah! A small
brawl with Ryoko should prove interesting!
[He starts writing again.]

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Ah, knock another chapter down for the M-man! Heh heh! Wait till the next
chapter,
Sharded Reality! See fast cars! Who the shadow figure is! What brand of hair
spray
Ryoko and Washu use! None of these will happen! (maybe...just
up to me!   hahahah....Muahahahha....MUAHAHAHAHHAHAH *cough! cough!*
Ow.)

Tenchi Muyo! : A Lone Shard Dreaming , Chapter 2 : The Sword
By: Rick "The Mirror Knight" Everts
Tenchi stuff owned by AIC, Pioneer. Mirror Knight (Mirror Knight, The
Shard, Xie) stuff is owned by ME. May the great and mighty lords of AIC
and Pioneer decide not to sue me. (A nice, short, legal stuff section,
you can thank me later.)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Rick: (Well, at least no one seems to be here, especially Ryoko.)
[He steps out of the lab door and closed it. There wasn't a sound in the
house, but Rick could her Sasami humming a little song outside.]
(Now, what do I do?)

[Sasami comes through the door(with Ryo-ohki behind her) carrying a bowl of
fruit.]

Sasami: Oh, hello Rick!

Rick: Um...hello Sasami!

[Sasami looks at Rick, puzzled, but decided to let it slide.]

Sasami: Are you feeling better?

Rick: Yes, thanks for asking.

Sasami: Do you want some fruit?

Rick: Sure, I'm starved!

[Sasami holds the bowl to Rick, who selects an apple. He bites into it,
and to his surprise, it tastes delicious.]

Rick: Thank you

Sasami: [giggles] Hey! I should go tell the others that you are awake!

Rick: No, thats alright. I want to walk around in clear my head. Im sure
Ill bump into
them. See you later!

Sasami: [Watches as Rick goes out the door.] What do you think of him,
Ryo-ohki?

Ryo-ohki: [Questionable tone] Myia myow?

Sasami: I don't know either. He seems nice enough, though.
