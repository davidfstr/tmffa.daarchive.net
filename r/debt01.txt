Jurai's Debt

Part 1
A Debt incured.

        "You're going to do it aren't you?" The first sister
spoke softly.
        "Yes. I can never understand these creatures if I do
not become a part of the universe as they perceive it." The
second sister spoke with conviction.
        "We don't even know for sure that they do perceive
it. The intelligence of the creatures who have developed so
far is almost non-existent. You should wait." The third sister
words where intelligent and filled with logic.
        "No. I will begin now. I have chosen a form and
location which will allow me time to adapt and prepare
before I am forced to interact directly with the creatures. It
is also a form that will allow me to maintain a portion of my
power."
        The third sister spoke again. "You should
reconsider. The form you have chosen is not compatible
with the intelligent life that appears to be evolving. Your
ability to interact will be limited."
        "You are planing something; are you not?" The first
sister questioned the second.
        "We all have plans; sisters."
        The energy which defined the second sister
dissipated. A small portion of the energy went beyond the
borders that defined their existence and entered the world it
had chosen.
        "What now sister?"
        The third sister pondered for a moment. "I believe
that I will wait for a time; then I will join her. But I will
choose a more suitable form."

        On a world far from the swirling cloud that would
someday be the place called earth, on a Land-mass that
would never have a name a tendril of energy found rest. The
energy formed physical roots which reached deep into the
soil and anchored itself against  the wind and rain, it formed
a stem which reached for the warmth of its mother sun, and
leaves to gather the rain and light, and it formed a second
set of roots; reaching not into the soil; but into the energy
which allowed all things to exist; the energy which would
allow it, and its children; to stand forever. The tiny bud felt
something akin to pride; this form would serve well.

        A few hundred million years later.

        Proud parents looked with love upon the tiny life
they had brought into this world.
        "What are we going to name her?" The father asked.
        "Washuu." The mother replied
        Neither knew the origin of the name; it was not one
they had ever heard before. But they would not question it.
        The tiny newborn girl looked up at them; her eyes
filled with a promise of intelligence beyond measure.

        "And now; I am alone." The first sister did not waste
energy on the emotion of loneliness. She summoned a
portion of her energy and began to formulate new plans; the
creatures which had evolved did possess intelligence,
however, they required guidance. She would guide them;
she would create conflict; through this they would grow
strong.

50,000 years later

        Yosho sensed a presence behind him; he turned;
bokken drawn, seeking an enemy.
        “Lord Yosho”
        Yosho returned his bokken to its place and bowed
politely to Tsunami. “My lady; I am honored by your
presence”
        “Be honored on your own time. Tenchi is falling
behind schedule. Correct this.”  Tsunami vanished in a flash
of light.
        Yosho waited for the spots to clear from his eyes; he
stood and walked to the door.
        Yosho walked slowly down the many steps to the
Misaki house; he took his time, enjoying the scenery. I will
miss this when I am gone, he thought

        The Misaki house was filled with people; a party
was in full swing. Balloons hung from the ceiling; a banner
hung over the door. The banner bore the words: HAPPY
18TH, TENCHI.
        Tenchi’s friends from high school were milling about
the room; music blared from the stereo in the corner.
Sasami and Mihoshi were serving drinks; Ayeka was
chatting with two girls in the corner; Ryoko was nowhere to
be seen.
        Yosho looked around for Tenchi. Noboyuki passed
by; camcorder in hand. “Noboyuki; have you seen Tenchi?”
        “he’s upstairs with Washuu and Ryoko; I got him a
computer and there setting it up.”
        Yosho walked upstairs. Howling Laughter emitted
from Tenchi’s room. Ryoko and Tenchi were staring into
the screen; apparently engrossed in a game. Washuu lay on
Tenchi’s bed reading the computer manual and laughing her
head off.
“Tenchi.” Yosho called
        Tenchi looked up and smiled. “Grandfather; I wasn’t
sure you were coming.”
        “I wouldn’t miss this; I have a present for you.”
Yosho produced a wooden box from his robe and held it
out to Tenchi.
        Tenchi took the box and examined it. The box was
round, roughly eight inches across. An intricate carving of a
tree adorned the top, strands of silver ran along the lines of
the trunk and branches; tiny but perfect diamonds, emeralds,
sapphires, and Rubies were scattered among the branches as
precious fruit. The outer rim was gold and divided into
twenty equal sections, nineteen of the sections contained
Juraian characters.
        “Grandfather; I can’t except this; It’s too valuable.”
        “I give you a gift and your complaining about the
cost of the wrapping paper?”
        “Wrapping paper?” Tenchi looked for away to open
the box; it didn’t seem to have any lock or clasp. He located
a metal plate on one edge of the box and pressed it gently.
There was a slight shock of static electricity and the box
popped open.
        Washuu leaned over Tenchi’s shoulder and peered
into the box. “What is it?”
        Inside the box were two items; one was a metal rod,
the other a medallion on a chain.
        The rod was four inches long, flat on one end, round
on the other. The flat end had an embossed image; the same
tree as on the box lid. The medallion also bore the tree; the
other side were four Juraian words.
        “What does it say?”
        Yosho took the medallion and hung it around
Tenchi’s neck. “We’ll discuss that tomorrow; be at the
shrine by Ten o’clock.” With that, Yosho left the room.
        Tenchi examined the medallion closely; he
recognized that the characters were Juraian, he had seen
enough labels on Ayeka and Sasami's luggage to know the
style.
        Ryoko leaned over Tenchi's shoulder. "What is it?"
        "I'm not sure. Washuu?"
        "Jura kray onel'ta da'nek."
        Ryoko and Tenchi turned to face Washuu. "Excuse
me?"
        "That's what it says."
        "I accept the burden of Jurai's promise." Ryoko
translated.
        "Debt."
        "What?"
        "Kray means debt; not promise."
        "What the heck are you two talking about?"
        Wahsuu turned the medallion over in Tenchi's hands.
"The writing on the back. It says 'I accept the burden of
Jurai's debt'; it's the seal of the Juraian empire."
        Tenchi stared at the words. "Why did Grampa give
this to me?"
        "Tenchi." Sasami pushed open the door. "Were
ready to cut the cake. Come on downstairs."
        Tenchi, Washuu and Ryoko followed Sasami back
to the party.

        Ten o'clock the next morning.

        Tenchi knocked on the door to the shrine office.
"Grampa?" He called out.
        "Over here!"
        Tenchi followed the sound of his Grandfather's
voice. He found him behind the shrine.
        "Grandfather; you wanted to see me?"
        Yosho continued to stare out at the countryside.
"Tenchi; let me tell you a story."

        Eight million years previous

        A starship; one of many; drifted aimlessly in space.
The ship showed signs of wear; black scorch marks streaked
it's surface as badges of honor. A young man stared out a
viewport; his thoughts more distant than the stars.
        "My lord?"
        The young man turned to face the officer who had
entered the room.
        "Yes?"
        The officer cleared his throat. "My lord; captain
Anosho has reported back. The attack on the Norkanian
convey is complete; we have seized their cargo without
incident."
        The Young man continued to gaze at the stars.
        "My lord?"
        "Is this what we have been reduced to?"
        "To what are you referring; my lord?"
        "I was born to be a king; now I  am but a petty
thief."
        "You are still a king."
        "What is a king without a kingdom?"
        "Your kingdom is space itself; what kingdom could
be greater?"
        "If you believe that Kunashi; then you are a fool. We
have a few hundred ships; but without planets or at least
space stations to gather and repair our forces we will
eventually be hunted down and destroyed."

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

        "Wait just a minute, what do you mean 'Eight million
years ago'?" Tenchi interrupted his grandfather.
        "The Juraian empire has existed for about eight
million years, now can I finish my story?"
        Tenchi crossed his legs and tried to get more
comfortable, this had the makings of a LONG story. I knew
Juraians live a long time, but this is ridiculous.

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

        "I believe then I may have some information that will
help." Kunashi held out a data storage sphere.
        Jurai took the sphere. "What is this?"
        "We recovered it  from the captain of the Norkanian
fleet, it may solve our main problem. Apparently the
Norkanian's discovered a new habitable planet."
        Jurai dropped the sphere onto his desk. "How far
from here?"
        "Less than two weeks at top speed."
        Jurai sat down at his desk and placed the sphere into
the reader. Planetary Data appeared floating in the air above
his desk. "Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, abundant water,
plant life. Any sentient life?"
        "None"
        "How does a world like this go undiscovered so
close to civilized space?"
        "We don't know my lord."
        "Kunashi, this has 'trap' written all over it."
        "I recommend we go there in force, if it is a trap
they won't be expecting a large number of ships. They
would expect us to send a small detachment who they could
capture and interrogate to learn the location of our main
fleet."
        "Damned if we do, damned if we don't. Right?"
        "As you say."
        "Summon the fleet, let us see this new world."

        Ten days later.

        "WHY ARE YOU HERE?"
        Jurai stood barefoot in a pool of shallow water,
before him was a great tree. The trees branches and leaves
glowed with a golden radiance. Hundreds of tiny blue
sphere sparkled among the branches. The pool of water
glowed from beneath. "Who are you?"
        "I AM POWER. WHY ARE YOU HERE?"
        "I'm seeking a home for my followers, we were
forced off of ours."
        "YOU FORCED YOURSELF OFF, YOU WERE
CRUEL TO YOUR PEOPLE."
        "We were not cruel! We took care of our people.
They cast us off."
        "YOU WERE CRUEL, YOUR PEOPLE
STARVED WHILE YOU LIVED IN LUXARY."
        "We took care of our people!"
        "THEN WHY DID THEY REBEL?"
        "I don't know."
        A beam of pure blue light lanced out from the tree
and struck Jurai in the chest, boring a hole through him, the
hole grew until it consumed his entire body.

        Jurai sat upright in bed, a cold sweat making the
sheets stick to him. He tore open his shirt and examined his
chest, not a mark. <A dream, it was only a dream. that
damned tree, every night it's that damned tree.>
        A small light on the nightstand began to blink. Jurai
waved his hand over the blinking light. "What is it?"
        "My lord we are approaching the planet."
        "I'll be there shortly."

        Jurai strode onto the bridge of his cruiser. Before
him hung a hologram of the planet. He turned to his nearest
subordinate. "Any sign of our enemies?"
        "No my lord, we have sent scouts to search the
moons shadow, and there is an asteroid belt nearby. We
must search the area thoroughly before we can make
planetfall."
        "No. We are alone. Land."
        "But my lord...!"
        Jurai silenced him with a glance. "Land. Now."
        "As you wish." The officer summoned a map of the
planet, numerous  potential sights were considered and
discarded.
        Jurai considered the local geography. there was
something strange about one particular valley, it tugged at
his memory. The tree dreams came to the forefront. The
odd shape of the valley was identical to a shadow that fell
on the pool of water. "There," Jurai pointed to the valley.
"Land there."
        The officer nodded and began to issue orders.

        Planetary dawn was just beginning when the ships
landed. Jurai's ship landed in the middle of the valley and
escort ships landed around on higher ground. soldiers began
to search the area for any sign of intelligent life.
        Jurai looked up at the trees before him. And up, and
up. Huge did not begin to describe them. All of the great
monuments and buildings of his home would have been
lawn ornaments by comparison
        "There's a lake about a mile from here. I've sent
some men to take samples to make sure we can drink it."
        Jurai did not seem to here Kunashi.
        "My lord?"
        Jurai nodded, "good. I'm going to have a look
around."
        "I'll assign some men to go with you."
        "No." Jurai did not wait for Kunashi to protest, he
simply began walking.

        Hours later Jurai came to rest under one of the great
trees. he had yet to find any sign of what he was looking
for, of course, he had no idea what he was looking for.
        Weary, Jurai sat on the ground and leaned against
the tree. The wood behind him gave way, and before he
could stop himself, Jurai was falling down a deep black
hole.

Jurai landed on a rock. His back, and several other bones,
broken. Somehow he was still alive.
        "YOU WERE WARNED NOT TO COME HERE."
        The voice from Jurai's dream came fro all around
him. The shallow water surrounded the rock
        Breathing was hard enough, answering was
impossible. We need shelter, and rest. Jurai's words echoed
in his mind.
        "WHY SHOULD I GIVE IT YOU?"
        Please. The single word was Jurai's only answer.
        The voice was stilled, as if weighing Jurai's very soul
against a feather of promise. The being, which had once
been the second of three sisters, contemplated the dying
man before her. She sought the pathways of the future. Her
sister had been correct; she lacked the ability to interact
directly with other life forms, except in dreams. She had
waited for this man for a long time, yet he was not what she
had expected; he was petty, arrogant, and weak. She had
allot of work to do.
        "I WILL MAKE A BARGAIN WITH YOU. DO
YOU ACCEPT?"
        What are your terms?
        "UNIMPORTANT, RISK ALL OR DIE."
        I agree.


        Moments later Jurai stood before the tree. His
forehead bore the mark of true power. His body was healed,
joining with one of Tsunami's children. Tsunami, he called
her. Meaning, in the language of his birth, power beyond
resistance. The bargain sealed, eventually Tsunami would
collect. He prayed his descendants did not suffer for it.

=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

        "So what was the deal?"
        Yosho looked up, "what?"
        "The deal, with Tsunami, what was it?"
        "No one knows. The eighteen emperors who
followed Jurai each agreed that whatever Tsunami
demanded would be given, no matter what it was."
        Tenchi reached into his pocket and produced the
medallion with the symbol of Jurai. 'I accept the weight of
Jurai's debt'. He knew what that meant now. "And this?"
        "I was given that when father made me heir to the
throne, now I give it to you. In five days you will go to
Jurai."
        Yosho turned and left Tenchi alone with his
thoughts.

TBC

In part 2: Wedding bells. (need I say more?) Also Tsunami had words with
the emperor
and some more family members take the stage.
