THIS STORY WILL TAKE PLACE YEARS AFTER SHIN TENCHI MUYO(WHICH IN MY OPINION
SUCKED,THE STORY LINE WAS SO THIN I COULD HAVE BLOWN MY NOSE ON IT)
SO LET ME CATCH YOU UP. EVERYONE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE MASAKI HOUSE AND NOT
MAKE TENCHI CHOOSE. BECAUSE EVERYONE KNEW HE WOULD NEVER CHOOSE ONE GIRL AND
CAUSE THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE A NUCLEAR MELT DOWN IF HE DID.
ANYHOO EVERYONE MET SOMEONE ELSE (YES THERE IS LIFE AFTER TENCHI)AND HAD
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN I MIGHT ADD. =^ ^=
AND NOW ALL THE LADIES ARE COMING BACK FOR WHAT YOU MAY CALL A TENCHI
REUNION.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**First I would like to open up this story with the now queen of Juri Ayeka.
She married Sagami (if you can remember from Tenchi universe).They had a
baby girl which they named Amherst because of the color of her hair.**
Amherst stood at the front of her mighty ship funaro.
Her Amherst colored hair cascading around her waist in two low ponytails.Her
bright brown eyes looking into the wide vastness of space that was her own
to see.
She turned to her mother who was sitting on the throne built into the tree
that sat in the middle of funaro.
Ayeka's hair had become even longer than it already was, it was wrapped
around her head and neck making it look like a Hindus scarf when she was
sitting.
"Mother,through my link with funaro we will be reaching our destination
shortly."
Amherst (a woman at 14) was curious as to the fact of why her mother would
bring her with her on a trip to see her friends from earth. Usually she
didn't allow her to go on meaningless trips such as this.
"Mother"?!
A startled Ayeka looked at her daughter.
"Very well then, she stood up with a sort of tallness she had not had when
with the Masaki family. Yes, she had grown in both body and mind. I will be
in my room please tell me when are in the solar system".
  As she was leaving the rather to large room a beeping was heard over the
trickle of the waterfall.
"Queen Ayeka". A familiar block of wood with a large red mark on his front
side said.
"There is a ship near by with the space number 9264S9FE that is trying to
commune with us would you like to except transmition"?

"Yes alright"Ayeka mumbled she was tired from the journey and wold have
rather took a beauty sleep then listening to someone babble about how crazy
it was to run into the queen of Juri all the way out here.

She was surprised to see a familiar face on the screen.

"Kiyonaye?!"

"Hello Ayeka".
The teal haired GP officer had changed so little she still wore the orange
head band except she had her hair in a ponytail and cut on both sides
instead of just one.
"You look wonderful Ayeka I never expected to see you first".

"Destiny is opon us, I received your letter disk and I remember you saying
you married twice in just this short time and you had two children . Is that
true, Kiyonaye?

"Well whether you noticed or not its been fourteen years."
Kiyonaye said this with a hint of annoyance.

"Oh Kiyonaye I meant nothing by that, excuse me."

"Yes well anyway this is my daughter Shionaye and son Rogue named after his
father my first husband."

Two children immediately were put on the screen the girl bowed gracefully.
She had dark green almost navy hair that was in two French braids on the
sides of her head.She looked to be about 13. Her dress was white with a
flower painted on the frount.
The boy on the other hand had jet black hair that was worn in tight ponytail
he had a black suit on with a dark purple cape. He looked older mabey 15. He
didn't bow just nodded until a quick look from mother told him otherwise.He
swept a short bow then left the room.

"I am pleased to meet your acquaintance Miss Ayeka."

"She is a polite one." Ayeka said with an approving smile.

"You'll have to excuss the other one." Kiyonaye said with a small chuckle.
"He has been silent and stubborn since his father died and I remarried."

"Now my turn, this is my princess daughter Amherst."
Amyerst enters the screen glad that her existance had been aknowledged.
"Hello, Shionaye and Miss Kiyonaye I am Amyerst first princess of Juri."


"Well now I'm sorry but I must end this now we will talk more when we get
there, alright?"

"Ok, good-bye for now Ayeka."

Amyerst turned to the log with the blue mark on the frount.

"Kamadakie, end connection."
