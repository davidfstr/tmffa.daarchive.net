Lost souls: act 6: the jurai within

Hay all, first off I need to tell you that all questions will be 
answered in a few,. and I need to tell you how Mayki comes into this, I 
wont tell you how he was born in the rest of the acts so ill tell you 
now, due to some shot of genetic. mess-up in one of Washu's thing 
Mayuka was a. boy when he was born, so they renamed him Mayki, ok, to 
the story!


"Ameka! Come back! We have more stuff for ya!" called Ameka's (who now 
is 16 and still does her hair the same and stuff only now she much more 
beautiful) best friend Reena (16 two)  "Coming!" she ran back to the 
room her friends where in
"My turn to give you my gift!" Reena handed her a gold box with a dark 
pink bow. Ameka quickly unwrapped it and took the top off and found a 
small, sleeping, orange kitten with a bow that matched the one on the 
box
"Oh! She so cute!" Ameka pulled her out. She had a small diamond on her 
forehead.
"Thanks Reena! And thank you Hotaru, Setsuki, Emmons, Kyoro! I don't 
know how I can thank you! I know, lets go to the movies! My treat!"
"Are ya sure?" Kyoro 
"Yeah!"   
"Maybe we should stay home and study" Emous said 
"Oh Emous!" every one but Emous said
"What?" 
"Let's go then" Ameka said through a laugh
"Yeah, we need some peace before our first day at crossroad high" said 
Setsuki 
"I wanna come two!" Lina (12) walked in
"Ok Chibi, you can come, no R rated movie then girls"
"We can't get in those anyway" Setsuki remarked  
 (P.s. if you didn't know, there all 16, but Lina of coarse)

*Tat* *tat* Temp's boot's clicked on the stone gravel. He stopped at a 
arch and read
"Crossroads" he thought for a moment
<Hum, she might be here, besides, it's September, school's in, she 
might be at the high school, ill go then. To school it is! >
He walked under the arch and into the town, only thinking one thing
^Please be here ^

"How's that plan on how to get out coming?" Cc asked 
"Thinking!" Ryoko said
"hello girls, I think its time to move you into different rooms
"what?!" they yell at the same time 
"shhh now, you don't want the king to hear, do you?"
"wha.." but before ether could finish they both were gone from the room 
and in others 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The next day!

"Crossroad high here we come!" Ameka said 
"Finely we get to go to high school, it seems like all we've been doing 
the past 2 month's is studying, it was getting more and more boring" 
Kyoro said
"I thought it was fun," Emous said
"Right, uh, Emous?" Setsuki asked
"Yeah?"
"What's wrong with you?"
"Oh please don't fight" Hotaru said
"Yeah, today's a day to celebrate! We worked hard to get here" Reena 
said
"Yeah and we're going to be late if we don't hurry up," Ameka said
"WHAT?!" they ran down the hall to a room marked 115 
"Just in time" Reena said as they sat as close to each other as they 
could
"Ameka are you ok?" Reena, who was siting on her other side, asked 
"Yeah, I just ran to fast, that's all" she looked at the desk next to 
her it was filled with a boy, one who had dark blue hair and two gold 
eyes like hers
"Hay, my names' Mayki, who are you?" he asked 
"Im Ameka, nice to met you" Ameka said
"Same here"       
"Class!" their teacher, a man about in his 30's with spiky jet black 
hair and brown eyes, rang out over the voice of the many teens who 
shut-up when he spoke "That's better. Now, as you might know, Im Mr. 
Masaki, you're new math teacher. First off im going to call you're 
name's because the school makes me" he picked up a broad and read off 
names
"Sanki, Oki"
"Here!"
And on and on like that till the last ones    
"Habuki, Ameka" 
^What?! ^ 
<Could it be? > 
^No, Habuki is a common name, I think ^ Tenchi shook his head
 "Here!"
"Masaki, Mayki"
"Here!"
"Tiki, Kyoro"
"Here!"
"Gyve, Hotaru"
"Here!"
"Sidns, Reena"
"Here!"
"Hunara, Setsuki"
"Waters, Emous"
"Here!"
"Collins, Temp"
"Here,"
"Ok then, first pop quiz"
And the day went on like that, and so did the week


"Finely, Saturday. Too bad all the girls have dates, oh well, ill just 
take a bath and drink some sake (like mother like darter) (don't ever 
do that at home! her side affects are fake! Sake will not do that to 
you!) Maybe ill have some sweet dreams for once" Ameka walked to the 
bath room, trended the water on, went to the kitchen, got some sake, 
went back to the bath room, got in the tub and downed a few bottles of 
sake
"Hum?" the little kitten (still not named) wandered in and climbed onto 
the side of the tub
"Hi little one, why are you up?" the kitten yawned and looked at her as 
she let go a loud "Hick!"
"Your drunk, aren't you?"
"How can?"
"Oh, I've always been able to talk, I just did talk to you"
"What's your name anyway?"
"Rosella, but you can call me Sella"
"Why wouldn't you talk to me before?"
"Because, you never showed me your power before"
"What power?"
"The jurai within you"
"The what? I thought jurai was folktale"
"No, it's real, and you're their princess"
"Cool"
"Ugh, your drunk, ill tell you later, or maybe." 
"Maybe what Sella?" Sella's diamond glowed and shone in her eyes. As 
soon as it hit her forehead a small diamond appeared on Ameka's head. 
When Sella moved away Ameka rouse in the air and a beautiful gold and 
dark pink dress and then fell softly to the ground 
"There, you should be sober now"
"Yes, I am, thank you"
"Now, because you'll forget all this when your body is sober as your 
mind im going out and get a tag with Sella on it, im tired of this cute 
little kitty c-"
"What do you mean I wont remember?!"
"You just wont, im sorry if it hurt's you knowing that, but at first I 
thought you would remember, but the queen sent me a brain wave to tell 
me your best off not knowing now"  
"But I like know that mom and Cc are ok and that I can help them-"
"But" 
"And I like know what I am-"
"But you-" Sella gave up and started to walk away as Ameka followed her 
and counted thing's off 
"And I like know I have the power to stop Kaiun and put a stop to all 
of this! And that I can find dad and he can help me get mom back"
"You know too much for your own good" 
"And I like knowing temp's out there looking for me still and im going 
to find him, then we can go back to the life we once had" Sella stop 
dead in her tracks
"The queen was right, you're better off. I just give you one thing to 
think about before I go, leave that boy alone! He's fate is to die, and 
you can't stop that!" Sella jumped out the window and left Ameka alone 
to ponder her last words.
"No, no-it-can't be, Temp-can't--die, --I love-and n-need-him t-t-too 
much" Ameka broke down in tear's "Wha-?" she felt something around her.
