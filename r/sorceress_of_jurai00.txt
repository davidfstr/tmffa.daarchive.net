"Kaima! Kaima! Where are you?" shouted a longhaired priestess.  Her red 
hair flew out behind her as she ran down the empty halls.  She could 
see someone up ahead.  It was another priestess.
	"Kaima, I just found the Lady! She's, she's." the first priestess 
struggled to say.  Kaima put her hand on her shoulder.  
	"I know Ninamo, she's dead," said Kaima softly.  Ninamo burst 
into tears.  Kaima hugged her tightly.
	"Now, now.  We can't have any of that.  You know why she's dead.  
We must find where the new one is," Kaima scolded.
	"I know where she is.  Her Ladyship told me right before she 
died.  She's on earth," sobbed Ninamo.  Kaima's eyes widened.
	"Earth?  Isn't that where Yosho was said to be seen?" asked 
Kaima.
	"Yes rumor has it she's his granddaughter," replied Ninamo.
	"Well then she shouldn't be to hard to find.  Let's go," said 
Kaima, even though she was halfway out the door.
***********************************************************
	The two priestess's arrived on earth a few days later.  As they 
landed their small ship on a little lake, an old man holding a baby 
girl came out of a nearby house.
	"So you're alive Yosho!  Do you have everything ready for the new 
Sorceress?" asked Kaima.  Yosho nodded.
	"You know, I don't really like this.  She's my only 
granddaughter, and once you take her and cast your spell, no one will 
remember she's alive," said Yosho.
	"You will know.  And so will everyone with Jurai blood in his or 
her veins.  Your daughter and grandson will both remember her," said 
Ninamo.
	"My grandson?  Ha! The boy isn't even a week old!" said Yosho.  
He kissed the sleeping baby and reluctantly handed her over to Ninamo.
	"Farewell, Keimosari" he whispered.  Kaima pulled a green jewel 
out of her pocket and muttered strange words over it.  A light brighter 
than the sun shot out of the jewel for almost a millionth of a second.  
And all knowledge of Keimosari, the new Sorceress of Jurai, was wiped 
from the earthlings' minds and hearts.
