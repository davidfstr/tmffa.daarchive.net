	THE HEART OF A DEMON AND THE TEAR OF A MOTHER 

				PART 2


On earth

	Tenchi woke up and went to his window and look at the 
lake thinking she's really gone.
In the kitchen Sasami was making breakfast as all ways. As 
Tenchi was coming down the stairs he looked at where Ryoko 
use to sleep and let out a sigh." GOOD MORNING TENCHI"said 
Sasami. Oh good morning to you too in a weak voice. Tenchi 
what's the matter?? Oh nothing.
Your thanking about Ryoko aren't you? Yea I am. I still 
don't get it she seemed so happy here why did she leave! 
Idon't no Tenchi I miss her to said a tiered eye Sasami.I 
think I'll go cheek on Washu. Tenchi she not in her lab. HUH 
she's not???? She has not step in her lab in day. Do you 
know where she is? She's on the roof. Ok thanks Sasami! 
There you are little Washu! HUH tenchi think to him self she 
in her adult form! Washu are you all right. Uh oh it's you 
Tenchi. What are you doing up here? Thinking. about what 
Ryoko that I never spent much time with her . Because of my 
mind link with her I never though about spending time with 
her and now she left and I can't scents her at all any more. 
Washu said as tears slowly ran down her face.Tenchi walk 
over to comfort her.Washu do you know why she left. Yes. 
Said Washu as she whipped tears away form her eyes. She left 
because she felt alone. What? What do you mean alone when 
where here for here so she was not alone. Said Tenchi with a 
surprise look on his face. True but she felt lonely
She tried to hide the way she felt but ever time Ayeka would 
say something about you not liking her feelings would show 
and then she would fight. She felt like she had no one. Then 
when Ayeka said that remark about who would ever love a 
demon she snap she lost control of her feelings.
She saw all the people that all called her monster, demon, 
garbag, useless and waste product in he mind that minuet 
when her eyes turn black. Then when she was putting Mymuka 
to bed and Mymuka called her mama she realized that there 
was not for her here she would never be Mymukas mother she 
would never find love and that she would always be a lonely. 
So she though if she is to be lonely then she might as well 
be alone. Just as Tenchi was about to say something a loud 
crying came from the house. ((Oh the baby up)) said Washu 
Tenchi went to cheek on Mymuka. He picks his darter up and 
try's to get her to stop crying but its no use. Whats wrong 
Mymuka why won't you stop crying??? Then Mymuka said mama. 
And Tenchi heart dropped and a tear came to his eye. He 
remembers the only one Mymuka ever called mama was Ryoko.
I'm sorry sweetheart but she gone I'm sorry. Tenchi don't 
you have to get to school? Said Ayeka.
Yea. I'll take care of the baby. Said Ayeka ok thanks. Said 
tenchi as he ran out the door to go to school.

SCHOOL

	That day at school he didn't pay any attention at 
school. At lunch one of tenchi friends sat down to talk to 
him. What's wrong Tenchi girl problems said Clark. Oh hey 
Clark said a sluggish Tenchi.whow man your out of it man. So 
im right ante I said Clark.yea Ryoko let 3 days ago.said 
Tenchi You mean that pretty girl that always followed you 
around that's tough. Said Clark in a COM voice. Well I guest 
you won't to be left alone. See you late Tenchi said Clark 
as he walk out of the door. Tenchi got up and went to the 
roof of the school. He remember when Ryoko blew his old 
school as he though about it he let out a little bit of a 
laugh and though that has one hell of a way to get someone 
attention.

CAVE

	After school Tenchi walk to the entrance of the cave 
that he use to play at when he was a kid and it was the 
place he first saw Ryoko even though she was a mummy then.
Tenchi look at the cave like he did when he was young and 
remembered how safe and warm he felt here but now he could 
not feel any thing.Tenchi walk to the tree where Kagato took 
here away and the he realize that was threw day he fell in 
love with her the only though that when though his mind that 
day was that he may never see her again. That does it I'm 
not going to loss you Ryoko Tenchi though as he ran to Washu 
lab. Washu are you here Washu???? Said Tenchi as he tried to 
catch his breath. Yes Tenchi what is it said Washu. I need 
to find Ryoko I cant loss her ever minuet I'm away from her 
I hurt. Said Tenchi with tears in his eyes. Then tell me one 
reason I should go back on my word I gave my daughter said 
Washu in a not serious tone. Cause I love her. Said 
Tenchi.Ok that's all I need to know. Lets see the homing 
becon on the ship put it on a remote plant 3 light years 
away from here. Homing becon??? So you put a becon on the 
ship so you could find her. Said a confused Tenchi yes but 
of course you did not think a mother would not keep track of 
her only daghter!! Said Washu. Washu you're a genius then 
Tenchi picked her up and kissed her on the check and ran out 
of the lab. RYEKE RYEKE WHERE ARE YOU. Just then Sasami and 
Ayeka came down the stair and ask Tenchi what's going on. I 
need Ryeke help. Said Tenchi Your going after her ant you 
Tenchi said Ayeka, Yes I love her. Rely said a surprised 
Sasami Tenchi just nodded. I'm sorry Ayeka I should have
