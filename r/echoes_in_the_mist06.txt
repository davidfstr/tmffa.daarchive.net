~~ Chapter 6 ~~ 

"Did you see that?!" Mihoshi cried and pointed at the monitor. 

"I saw it! I saw it! That scum!" Kiyone turned around to face Washu and Ryoko. She banged her hands on the table where they were sitting. "What happened? Why
are you just sitting there? Why aren't you doing anything?" 

She couldn't believe what she saw before her eyes. 'Tenchi' just disappeared without a fight. Hakusana obviously, didn't shoot him on purpose. Then she didn't even
bother to talk to Aeka but walked back to the lab instead. 

Ryoko was sitting cross-legged on the chair with on hand on the table and the other supporting her hand. She rolled her eyes in boredom. "Why don't you ask
Hakusana?" she emphasized Hakusana’s name. 

At the same time she finished her question, the doors opened and Hakusana walked in. She seemed darker than usual. Then she resumed her usual position, leaning
on the wall with her arms folded across her chest. 

"Okay, what happened back there, Hakusana?" Kiyone demanded. 

Hakusana snarled and looked away. "What do you care?" 

"We are partners on this. We are supposed to be open with our actions and words. You were suppose to take care of him and nothing else!" 

"I did take care of him," she growled. "He's gone isn't he? The princess is okay." 

"Take care of him means to take him out! Knowing you, I should have known you would have done something like this!" 

"That's where you're wrong Kiyone! You don't know anything about me at all!" 

Kiyone paused. "You're right Hakusana. I don't know anything about you. That's why I can't trust you." 

"No one can trust a space pirate," Ryoko spoke up. 

Kiyone looked at her. "What?" 

"Like I said before," Ryoko smiled deviously. "Why don't you ask, HAKUSANA?" 

All eyes turned to Hakusana, waiting for her to make a move. She glared at Ryoko but reluctantly took took a seat at the table. Mihoshi and Kiyone followed her
and sat down. 

"Okay, look," Hakusana started her story. 

* * * * * 

Five year old Hakusana Liang sat silently on the tree branch which shaded her simple house. She could spot practically anything from there and what a view! She
could see past the meadow into the small range of trees up to the beach and the sea. 

"**Hakusana!**" her father's voice called her in Chinese. 

Hakusana looked his way and waved at him. She got down from the tree and ran toward him. By the time she reached him she was already panting. Hakusana
asked, "**Hello father! What are you doing?**" 

"**Rest first, Hakusana." He sat down on the ground himself and Hakusana sat down with him. He took out a knife. "Do you know what this is?**" 

"**Sure, it's a knife and it's very dangerous. **" 

"**Do you want to hold it? You have to be very careful. **" 

Hakusana nodded eagerly. She was very obedient when her parents told her not to touch her father's weapons and other things. But when she would watch her
skilled martial artist of a father practice with it, she would always want to do the same. But she didn't since she was told not to do so. But what was her father doing
now? 

Gently, she took the knife into her own small hands and gripped it tightly. "**What happens now, father? **" 

Mr. Liang laughed. "**What happens? You're just suppose to hold it. Why? Do you want to learn how to throw it like me?**" 

Hakusana nodded again. "**Please?**" 

Mr. Liang laughed again. "**Okay, let's see you throw it into that tree there. **" 

"**Are you sure?**" Hakusana asked. She couldn't believe her father just said that. He nodded and she held the knife up in her hand. He guided it to the right
position. 

"**Okay... throw it.**" 

So Hakusana threw it into the tree. Her throw was sharp... not exactly on the spot she was aiming, but pretty good for a beginner and a five year old. 

Everything after that came so easily. Throwing knives and blades came so naturally to Hakusana and it was practically just a game to her. Every morning she couldn't
wait for her dad to call her and they would practice till 4 in the afternoon. 

One morning, when she was 12, Hakusana's expectations didn't live up. That day started the incident that changed her whole life forever. 

"**Good morning,**" She greeted her mother in Chinese. She sat down at the table. "**Where is father?**" 

"**He's sick, sweetheart, **" Mrs. Liang replied sadly. 

"**Sick? **" She echoed. It was strange because her father never got sick. "**Well, he'll get better**." She said reassuringly. 

"**Yes, I'm sure he will.**" Her mother said and sat down beside her. 

But Mr. Liang never got better. In fact, he got even worse everyday. And so did Mrs. Liang. She would spend most of the time by his bed. Hakusana never saw her
sleep. And whenever she went out of the room, her eyes were always red and tired. 

One day, Hakusana finally went to the door of her parent's room. She stood bye silently, not wanting to intrude on her parent's pain. 

But despite her ambivalence, she walked through the dark room. Her mother had fallen asleep on the chair beside her father's bed but Hakusana could hear her
sobbing softly in her sleep. 

She tiptoed to her father and took his cold hands into hers. Then she sat on the bed and whispered to him, "**Don't leave us. We need you. **" 

He stroked her head and smiled. "How can I leave you, Hakusana?" They lay there for a moment, just staring at the ceiling. There was so much to be said but it
seemed like it was already spoken despite the silence. Finally, Mr. Liang;s hand slid out of hers. He closed his eyes and died. 

"**Goodbye,**" she said with a quiet sincerity. 

Hakusana took one last look at him then she turned to her mother. She was still asleep. In her hands, she clutched an envelope. Hakusana turned away and ran out
of the room. She couldn't help the tears as they started to slowly spill down her cheeks. 

The next morning, Hakusana was still sleeping when she heard a huge roaring sound outside. She sat up straight in her bed and looked outside. Surprised at what she
saw, she quickly got dressed and ran outside. 

"**Mother! Mother! Did you see what's outside?**" She screamed in Chinese. 

"**Of course I did,**" her mother snapped. "**We're leaving for Jurai. That's our transportation.**" 

Hakusana took a moment to get used to the nasty tone in her mother's voice. She had never heard her mother talk like that. Then also, what was... "**Jurai?**" 

"**It's a planet in another galaxy, sweet heart. That's where I'm from. That's where you are from, Hakusana JURAI Liang.**" 

"**You never called me that before. I have never heard the name Jurai.**" 

"**My name, Hakusana, is Akemi Jurai. When I came here to earth, I fell in love with your father and married him. He never knew about Jurai but I was content to
stay here. Now he is gone and we are going home. **" 

"**I am home.**" Hakusana turned away and ran back into her bedroom. 

That afternoon, Mr. Liang was buried. Hakusana and Mrs. Liang left to go to Jurai. Every thing happened so fast to Hakusana so all that time, she was at shock. The
Juraians seemed to speak a different language and not Chinese. They gave her a translator until she learned the language herself. 

When they arrived in Jurai Hakusana hated it. She hated and dreaded ever second, every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month and it continued
on, year after year. 

She even hated her mother for the person she had become. Mrs. Liang or should I say, Lady Akemi, as she was now called in Jurai, had changed so much since Mr.
Liang's death. Hakusana probably had too. 

And ever since they arrived, all the Juraians said that she was the most disagreeable child and it was true. Hakusana's long hair was always tangled up around her
pale thin face. In less than a year, she had become a tyrannical brat in front of everyone. 

Everyone that is, except her sensei, Aidan. At first they didn't get along well and had spiteful matches. She was as good as him because of her father's training. But he
was still able to teach her and he improved her techniques so much. In fact, she became so good that she could beat practically anyone in Jurai. 

After a while, Hakusana realized what Aidan was doing for her and she decided that he wasn't such a bad guy after all. They became good friends after that. 

"Sensei?" Hakusana asked one day in the middle of their usual morning matches. It had already been 6 years and she was already 18. She blocked his attack and
flipped out of the way. 

"Yes, Hakusana?" Aidan took his spear and threw it at her. 

"I was thinking." Hakusana leaped into the air, barely missing the spear. As she landed, she took the spear and flipped over to Aidan in less than a second. Aidan
found the spear pointed directly at his throat. 

"What were you thinking?" Aidan asked. He grabbed the spear and turned it's position toward Hakusana and at the same time, he thrust it into her. 

Hakusana was too fast and she jumped out of the way. "I was thinking about how miserable my life is here in Jurai." 

"I think you don't have enough friends." In a blur, he was gone. 

"I have no friends." She felt his presence behind her and made a strong sharp uppercut. "Except you." 

Aidan dropped to floor and tripped her. Taking his spear, he pointed it at her throat. "You have to let people get the opportunity to get to know you better. They'd
be surprised at what they find." 

"They don't want to get to know me better. I don't want them to get to know be better AND I don't want to get to know them better. Break?" 

"Sure." Aidan lifted his spear and walked to the benches. Then he continued, "So you want to keep the name 'the rebellious child,’ Hakusana?" 

"Well, it's fine with me. But I REALLY don't like it here on Jurai. My life is miserable, as I have mentioned before." 

"Don't set your goals by what others consider important, Hakusana. Make your own decisions and only know what is best for you. Everyone is unique in their own
special way." 

"I know sensei. Thanks for everything." Hakusana gave hugged him and smiled. Even though Aidan was a bit slow minded at times, he was always so patient and
kind. Not only that, he was a great teacher, martial artist, warrior and above all, a friend. 

Aidan pulled away. *She looked so beautiful,* he thought, looking at her green eyes. "Well, I believe you have a ball to attend," he said. 

"Yeah. You'll be home all evening, right?" She asked. Aidan nodded. Hakusana stood up and she was gone. 

* * * * * 

Hakusana ran to her room and took out her suit case which she had packed the night before. It carried some of her things, weapons and other necessities. Tonight,
she wouldn't be going to the ball. Instead, she'd be leaving for good. 

If only she could make it outside her mom's 'tree' mansion and into her ship without anybody noticing. The problem was her two guardians outside her door. She
walked out calmly. 

"Good evening, Lady Hakusana." Her two guardians bowed. 

"Good evening," she replied dryly. 

"My lady, where are you going in that outfit? I should remind you that there is a ball tonight," Amphitryon said. 

"I know. I'm just going to Aidan's house for 5 minutes." 

"Okay," Madake said uneasily. 

Hakusana raised her eyebrow. "I will be back, you know." With that she leaped up about 20 feet in the air and jumped out of the balcony. 

At lightning speed, she ran to Aidan's house. "Sensei!" She screamed as she rapped on the door. 

Aidan opened the door. "Hakusana? What is it?" 

"Well, I guess I wanted to say I'm leaving." 

"But you just got to my house." 

"No, I mean, I'm leaving Jurai." 

"What? Wait a minute...let's think this over." 

"I have thought it over. You give me one good reason why I should stay. No one likes me here you know. No one really wants me to stay." 

"I want you to stay. I like you." Aidan watched Hakusana hesitate. He continued. "I think you are a very special and talented person and by doing this, you'll only
waste your life." 

"Sorry sensei...Aidan. I have already wasted six years of my life here." 

"So this is goodbye?" 

"No. No goodbyes." Hakusana turned around and walked away. 

Aidan watched her, not knowing what to do. What COULD he do? He liked her. Hell, he LOVED her and he didn’t want to let go of her. But Aidan wasn’t very
good at love. He never spoke of his feelings or showed it. 

Hakusana knew though, that Aidan liked her. It hurt her to see him like that. But Hakusana didn’t love Aidan back. It just didn’t work that way. He wasn’t her type.
Heck, he was her sensei for goodness sake. 

Still, Aidan loved her. One more effort to get her to stay..."Hakusana!" He called. She turned around. "I love you!" 

Hakusana gave a faint smile. "Don't do that, Aidan," she said. Then she turned around and ran out of sight. 

* * * * * 

"So what happened, this time?" Keiji asked. His deep raspy voice made Hakusana shudder in her seat. It took time to get used to. 

Keiji was her ship. Since she didn't want any of the Juraian ships, she had her own ship made by some people who specialized in magic. They created a great battle
ship and instead of a tree like the Juraians, the Keiji was a ball of fire that sat in a glass globe in the center of the main deck of the ship. 

"I decided to leave Jurai," Hakusana answered simply. She was sitting in the captain's chair of the ship. 

"What about Aidan?" 

"What about him?" 

"You liked him...didn't you?" 

Hakusana paused. "Yeah, I did. But he wasn't worth it." 

"How can you seem so sure? You shouldn't let things go, Hakusana. Once you loose them, you'll find out that life is meaningless." When Hakusana didn't say
anything he changed the subject. "Did you talk to your mom?" 

"No." 

"Well, here's your chance. There's a message from her. Do you want to take it?" 

Only then did Hakusana notice the yellow flashing button on her control pad. She hesitated for a moment then pushed it. 

Like Keiji said, it was her mom. Aidan was beside her. Lady Akemi smiled sadly. "Hi." 

Hakusana scowled. "Hi." 

"How should I start? Um, Hakusana, I love you and I know you love me. But these days we act as if we hate each other." 

"Acting? I don't think it's an act for me. And if it is for you, it's been going on since dad died. What's love anymore, anyway?" 

"Come back." 

"Come back to what? You? Sorry mother, you don't mean anything to me anymore. I can't come back to a nothing of a person." 

Lady Akemi narrowed her eyes and stood up straighter. "Fine, then! If that's how you want to play it, I have already sent a group of Juraian ships after you." 

"Why do you want me back so much? All I have ever caused you was pain!" 

"That's what a mother is for. You are my daughter. And besides, you remind me..." Lady Akemi took a deep breath, "you remind me of your father...the same
brown hair and eyes..." 

"You never gave me anything. You just want me for your own selfish reasons!" 

"I want you to have the best life ever and you keep refusing me!" 

"I don't want you! You already destroyed my life when you brought me to Jurai! You should have thought about that before you left earth." 

"What's done is done. You can't change the past and bring back your father!" 

"You know what mom? Neither can you." 

Aidan finally spoke up and interrupted them. "Now that's taking it too far, Hakusana!" 

"Taking it too far?! You are talking about me taking it too far?!" Hakusana raged. "I'll show you taking it too far!!" 

"Hakusana!" Aidan tried to stop her. 

"Here's taking it too far: Mother got mad at me every day, every night, ever since dad died. I feel like I'm in a world and wherever I turn, my mother is at my back. I
don't need anyone preaching to me right now." 

"Let's calm down..." 

"She got mad at me because dad died, Aidan. Was that my fault? Do you find it fair for a 12 year old girl to just have all this responsibility knocked to her
shoulders?" 

"Well, no..." 

"Good! Cause neither do I! And you know what else she did? Do you know what else this... this WHORE did?" 

"Don't call her that!" 

"She dragged me halfway across the universe to Jurai the very day my father was buried! And he was buried the next day he died! How's that?! A little too soon,
don't you agree? She didn't even consider what I wanted!" 

This time, Aidan looked at Lady Akemi in surprise. She just remained silent. 

Hakusana continued. "Mother, here, doesn't seem to know what is enough! How long do you think I could stand living the way you wanted me too? The ways of a
slave? An animal? I don't know how you want to call it!" 

Aidan tried again. "Hakusana! That's enough!" 

"No that's not enough! Mother hasn't received what she deserves! And what would that be? According to me, a one way ticket, all expenses paid, courtesy of her
own deeds, to the deepest abyss of hell!" 

"You don't mean that..." 

"How would you know? You don't know what she's did to me! You don't know what it was like!" 

"Hakusana! Let's talk this over. Stop already, okay?" 

"No. It's not okay. I have already tried listening to reason for 6 years and you know what? It didn't work because now, I realize, it was cause there wasn't any
reason in the first place." 

Finally, Lady Akemi tried to talk. She started with a gentle tone. "Look Hakusana, I am your mother. You will do as you are told. Come home." 

"You can't control me anymore! I'm 18 years old! I'm not a child!" Hakusana slammed her hand on the control pad and the connection was closed. 

Keiji whistled. "That went bad." 

"Very bad," Hakusana agreed. 

"So I guess that means we're going to be attacked." 

"I guess." 

"What's the matter? I thought you'd enjoy this." 

"I'm not thrilled." Then she gave a faint smile. "But I do want my mother to pay. I want those Juraian ships down." 

"Then I'll help you." 

* * * * * 

In less than a minute, a fleet of 15 Juraian ships came. The 15,000 tons of massive destruction floated around the Keji. They surrounded her fully, even at the top and
the bottom so Hakusana could not escape in anyway. 

Without any hesitation, Hakusana lowered her canons and fired at all of them. The missiles exploded and not one Juraian ship was left undamaged. 

Before any of them could react, a huge white ray of gas sprayed across to two ships. They were suddenly painted with icicles. The frozen ships were now as delicate
as glass so Hakusana flew thrwm them easily. 

After that, she took all the ships down, one by one. Killing them was a mistake. The severe crime was painted on Hakusana's reputation. She was already known for
her rebellious wats and impressive fighting skills. Except this time, she was wanted by the Juraian forces. 

The years went by. Hakusana was never heard or seen again. Basically, she was just forgotten. 

What really was happening was that Hakusana became a space pirate. She hardly had any choice because of the life style she ended up in. But she became one of
the best, with her father and Aidan's training. 

Only few people knew her personally. The other people she made business with did not see her or contact her directly. The rest who saw her ended up dead. 

But decades went by. Hakusana grew older and older. She was human too so she didn't live to be even 200 years old. At 80, she was still strong and agile. No one
could do her techniques as well as she did it. But they were faster and one day, someone would take her down. 

Besides, Hakusana didn't think she could get any higher than she already was. There was no point in having a lower reputation. So she disappeared leaving her
reputation as it was. 

* * * * * 

Aidan opened the door to see an old woman standing there. She had a black cloak on and just looking at her, she was like a mystery and secret. There was
something familiar about her face and the way she carried herself: proudly and somehow, angrily. 

She spoke first. "Hello, sensei." 

Aidan couldn't believe it. "Hakusana?" 

Hakusana nodded. "Yeah, it's me. Can I come in?" 

"Sure." They went to the living room and sat down to talk. "What happened to you?" 

"I have been forgotten, Aidan. No one knows who I cam anymore. No one ever really did." 

"It's been 62 years. You have been a wanted criminal. I can't believe you came back here." 

"Don't get me wrong. I still don't like Jurai. Or my mother for that matter... though I miss her. I always have. I miss the person she used to be." 

"So why did you come back?" 

"Doesn't matter. I'm back here with you now. But if you must know, I had no where else to turn to. My life is ending, anyway." 

Aidan couldn't help but notice that she kept looking at the mirror and touching her face. Finally he said, "You know, you'll always be beautiful to me." 

"Stop it. You are three hundred years older than me. But I look so old... and you're so young..." Hakusana put her hands to her face. Tears started to form in her
eyes but they never fell. It was something she had learned to do, how to not cry. "If only I could be young again." 

Aidan looked at Hakusana in pity. Gently, he took her hand. "There is a way." ---------------
