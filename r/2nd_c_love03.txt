(Note I: The POV changes from chapter to chapter, so bear with me here 
if it's a bit confusing ...  
this is just the best way to tell the story, IMHO! ^_^) 
(Note II: The following chapters - until noted - are various characters 
from the story re-living what happened. In other words all this 
happened before the first chapter ... or in the past ... you get the 
point I hope!) 
2 days earlier than events in Chapter 1----------------------------- (I 
have to say that or I get confused ...) 
   A man in a hooded cape enters a rather distinguished looking house 
near the Jurai Royal Council assembly building.  He heads for the 
chairman's offices and quietly opens the door, a man in Jurian royal 
attire motions the man to come in and take a seat. 
Spy: I have found out that the firsts Prince and His wife are leaving 
for Megami tomorrow, My Lord. 
Lord Rengo: Good, have you made the "Proper Arrangements to their 
shuttles' systems? 
Spy: Yes, My Lord, when they pass the Planet Skavala, the signal will 
be triggered and they will be forced down to the Planet as planned. 
Lord Rengo: Is the Dampening field set up on the planet? 
Spy: Yes, Lord Rengo, and the two assassins are already waiting for 
their targets to arrive! 
Lord Rengo: Excellent, My family will have their revenge and I will 
finally have the chance to get rid of the blasphemous Jurai Royal 
family and install my family as the New Royal Family.  
(Lord Rengo was referring to the feud between his family and the 
current Royal Family.) and  
4.000 years ago the past royal family died out, & a new Emperor had to 
be chosen from the Jurian families of nobility.  
One family that was lobbying for the throne was Rengo's. Instead the 
family headed by Azusa was chosen and he was made Emperor.  
Rengo was furious, and vowed to himself to get rid of Azusa and his 
family, so he could become Emperor. throughout the next 4,000 years 
there had been many attempts, on the Emperor and members of the family. 
All had failed. Most were in some way connected to Rengo. Now, Rengo 
saw an opportunity to wipe out the only male heir, his wife, whom Rengo 
considered scum, and force Ayeka from power either by assassinating 
Sagami, and either forcing Ayeka to marrying one of his sons. Either 
way Rengo would control the throne. 
***********************************************************************
************************** 
As time came near for a final vote on forcing Tenchi to marry a second 
wife, Ayeka sent Sasami back to Earth with Mihoshi ,Washu and the two 
Jurian Knights (Human, Not logs). Tenchi and Ryoko went with Kiyone to 
visit her mother on the Planet Megami, and Sagami was using his and 
Ayeka's Uncles political connections to influence the vote, but to no 
avail. The council approved the resolution to have the Emperor be 
married; First- to more than one wife, and second- that one wife must 
be of Jurian Royal Lineage 
Ayeka was depressed, as Sagami held her after the council adjourned; 
Ayeka: Oh My love, I don't know what will happen next, I am afraid for 
you, now that you are a target for those who want my family forced off 
the throne. 
Sagami: Ayeka, you know me enough to know I can take care of myself. 
Besides, hasn't Tsunami said the you and this family will serve her and 
not any other. (This calmed the distraught Empress a bit, but then she 
thought of her friends and family). 
Ayeka: I am now thinking that we made a mistake my love, please contact 
Sasami's and Tenchi's ships to see if they're OK. 
Sagami makes the appropriate adjustments to the comm link. They do 
contact Sasami's ship and all is well, but as they contact Kiyone 
piloting the Jurian shuttle, they are horrified to see that Kiyone is 
asking for help and that she was having a systems failure on the 
shuttle, before they could pinpoint where they were, the signal 
abruptly shut down. Now, Ayeka knew that there was a threat not only to 
her family, but to Jurai. She quickly contacted her mother, The former 
Empress and still current head for Jurian security to find out from her 
what could be done. 
***********************************************************************
************************* 
As she was piloting the shuttle Kiyone's thoughts were on the decisions 
she was going to make these next few days. Will I be willing to marry 
Tenchi, and being the second wife share his love with Ryoko? Will I be 
willing to take on the responsibilities of a Jurian Princess, and Maybe 
an Empress? Would I be willing to give up being a Galaxy Police 
officer? Oh god, what am I going to do? She said to herself as tears 
start welling up in her eyes. Then all thoughts are put aside as a 
warning light & klaxon sounds as most of the systems on the shuttle 
abruptly shut down. 
Tenchi: (As he comes running into the Cockpit of the shuttle) What's 
Happening Kiyo-chan? 
Kiyone: (Still not use to the "Chan", Answers) Everything seems to have 
gone out, I'm trying to get to the nearest Habitable planet, Ten-chan! 
Tenchi: (he sits in the co-pilots seat ) The sensors still work, look 
there a planet is coming up to out port side, it's called Skavala, try 
to land there if you can! 
Kiyone: Why don't you go back and secure Ryoko, I don't know how 
serious a landing were going to get! 
Tenchi: (Gets up from the co-pilots chair, then kisses Kiyone with a 
quick but passionate kiss) I want you alive from this, don't try to be 
a hero. You know what I mean (he hugs her, then goes back to strap 
himself and Ryoko in) 
Kiyone: Ok you two, I am going to land in a steep angle, and as soon as 
we clear the atmosphere I'm putting the ships shields on the front and 
bottom of the ship so it takes most of the impact, brace yourselves 
As she skillfully maneuvers the crippled ship, the last of the power 
gives out, and they plummet towards the surface, Tenchi then calls on 
the light hawk wings, which then cushions the shuttle as it hits the 
surface, the wins slow down the shuttle, but the stress finally taxes 
Tenchi's energy reserves and he passes out. Ryoko tries to put up a 
force field but she's knocked out  from some debris whirling around 
within the shuttle. Kiyone was fighting the controls all the way as the 
shuttle finally came to a stop. All three were knocked out . 
Assassin #1: Well, our pray have arrived! 
Assassin #2: I always love to hunt down these royal types, I love to 
see them beg for their privileged lives as they die!, HAHAHAHAHA! 
Assassin #1: The dampening field is on, so lets start towards their 
position. 
Assassin #2: I'd be really disappointed if their already dead, I'd like 
a challenge not grave duty. 
Assassin #1: You'd get paid either, way! 
Assassin #2: I don't do this for the pay, got it! 
Assassin #1: OK,OK, let's get going! 
As they make their way towards there intended victims,  
   
   
 Next, the trio had to fight for survival and to guarantee Ryoko's baby 
can live.  
Kiyone finally makes her decision in the next chapter.
