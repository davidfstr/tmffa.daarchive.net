                        A Test of Time
                                                     
                           PROLOGUE

{Small fires fill the once beautifully designed room of the Goddess's 
chambers as signs of battle are show on the walls and floor with 
massive craters and chard marks as a war between the forces of light 
and darkness carry on.} 

"Damn you! I have to help Tenchi!" Ryoko screams as she seems to be 
slightly wounded as she presses her attack on D3 who has given her more 
trouble than she had thought, as she swings blow after blow all her 
attackes seem to go right trough him, but she sees something when one 
of her attackes glances the red gem on his forhead. "I see, now you 
die!" 
With a quick attack she ends his life as she cuts down through his red 
gem, but her victory is short lived as she looks over to a badly beaten 
Tenchi as Z prepares to end his life with one final attack.
"Tenchi! look out!......" she uses her own body as a shield in front of 
him.
 "Ryoko! No!" Tenchi yells as she leaps in front of him taking a 
massive energy blast from Z, and shortly after she turns to Tenchi and 
smiles before falling to the ground. Tenchi quickly runs to her side 
holding her in his arms tears running down his cheeks. 
"Ryoko...why...why did you put my life before your own?" 
She slowly reaches up putting a gentle hand to his cheek and forces a 
smile. "Tenchi...without you I have no life nor would I want one 
without you to share it with...
*her hand slowly falls away from his cheek as she fights to keep 
conscious as she feels herself slipping away*..I...I love you..ten..chi 
I only wish I could have found out how you truly felt about....me...." 
her eyes slowly close tears escape as she does, using whats left of her 
strength she holds him for the last time.
 Tenchi  gently pulls her close to him his tears falling to her face 
mixing with her tears as he whispers to her... "I love you Ryoko. I 
have for a long time now, and your actions here will not be in vain I 
swear it." 
she slowly opens her eyes and her gaze meets his as they each slowly 
move towards one anothers lips.
Just as their lips are about to meet another blast throws the two to 
the side. 
"Ahw did I interrupt anything? *snickers to himself knowing full well 
what he's done* poor poor Ryoko, she'll never know true love now will 
she. *grins to himself as he looks to the now passed on Ryoko then to 
Tenchi who is now in raged * 
"You!... You Bastard! she loved life more than anyone I will ever know, 
and you took that from her....*his painful gaze cuts through Z's* and 
now, now I will take it from you Ahhhhhhhh!" Tenchi dashes towards Z 
with a hate he never knew he had bringing up his light hawk sword 
against Z's over and over again as the two engage in a battle that  can 
only be described as beautiful.
 Yet in another chamber another battle is being fought one of which 
could alter the course of the universe forever as three goddesses fight 
with one another.
 The now adult Washus eyes go wide with pain as the mental link with 
her daughter is painfully cut off.
 "Ah my dear sister Washu I can feel your pain and what lovely pain it 
is." Lady Tokimi slowly circles Washu with a half smile "So I guess my 
Z was successful with dealing with your precious Creation. *Lady Tokimi 
chuckles to herself* Yes Im deeply sorry, its a shame though about her 
killing my D3 before her death, I guess now I'll just have to find 
another. After I kill you all." with a evil grin she quickly flys 
towards Washu to end her life in her state of weakness over the lose of 
her daughter, but as she nears her she is pushed back from the force of 
now fused Sasami/Tsunami. 
"Sister Washu I truly feel for the lose of Ryoko your daughter I do, 
but if you die now our battle...her battle here would all be for 
nothing sis....aah!" she is slammed into a wall as wave after wave of 
dark energy wash over her. 
"Die sister die HAHAHA! I will not lose to the likes of you or anyone." 
Tears start to form in Sasami/Tsunamis eyes as she feels her power 
draining from the on coming attacks. "I'm sorry...Tenchi...." she 
slowly closes her eyes awaiting her death.
 "Noooo!!" Washu slams into Lady Tokimi tackling her to the floor, as 
she slams her fist into her stomach over and over again a crater starts 
to form as she pushes down harder. "I will not let you win Tokimi I 
will not, not after what you did to my child! my daughter Ryoko!" 
Lady Tokimis body fills with a gold light which she fires onto Washu 
knocking her off,  She then hovers up into the air joining her sisters, 
and the three goddesses eye one another before starting their battle 
again .
   "Well boy it seems you have more power than I thought,*wipes a small 
amount of blood from his lip* but will it even be enough!" Z charges 
knocking Tenchi back with his shield throwing him off balance long 
enough for him to score a hit leaving a gash down Tenchis arm. 
The power of the light hawk wings slowly start to heal him and again 
Tenchi is ready to attack. Tenchi summer salts up into the air over Z  
trying to cut down his backside only to have his attack blocked by Z's 
shield causing him to jump away from Z.
 "You'll have to do better than that Tenchi if you want to avenge your 
dear little Ryoko HAHAHA!" 
Tenchis rage grows as he hears this, but calms himself as he pulls up 
one of the light hawk wings and holds it up in front of his hands 
causing it glow brighter as he concentrates his power into it.  
"Oh and what do you plan to do with that?!" Z grins at the small 
looking blast.
 "My grandfather once told me to never let the size of the enemy fool 
you for their is always something the eyes can miss." Tenchi rest his 
eyes as the symbols on his forehead start to glow brightly as does the 
energy from the wing but remains the same size.
 "HA! that only tells me your grandfather was a fool. Now! Die like he 
did at my hands!" Z summons a huge mass of black energy and throws it 
towards Tenchi just as Tenchi seems to do the same with his.
As the two blast collide a blinding light fills the chamber where they 
fight.
 Z's eyes go wide in shock as he reaches for his stomach only to find 
Tenchi embedding the light hawk sword into him. "H..how did you get 
past my...blast?.." Z coughs up blood as Tenchi twist the blade and 
pulls it out quickly letting Z fall to his knees. 
"I wasn't forming a blast to attack you Z, I was building the power to 
my shield to reflect your blast making you think they just collided and 
destroyed one another."
 Z falls to his back his body racked with pain and Tenchi kneels down 
next to him and whispers in his ear. "You let your own misguided 
judgment tell you other wise, you told yourself that you couldn't be 
beating and that was your weakness." Tenchi leans back and looks over 
Z.
Then closing his eyes Tenchi says a quick prayer, he then pulls up his 
sword to deal a quick finishing blow to a slowly painfully dying Z.
As his sword starts to comes down a blast rocks the back wall causing 
him to turn his attention away from the dyeing Z.
Lady Tokimi screams out in rage as her two sister attack her together 
and feeling her Z slipping away she powers up all of her remaining 
strength in to one finial deadly attack as she pulls the dyeing Z into 
her self taking his energy to build onto her own. "HAHAHAHA!! No NO! I 
will not lose,. I will not now you all DIE!!!!" She fires a very large 
blast towards her sisters as the two in turn do the same summoning up 
all their power to stop their sister.
A blinding light is formed as the energies of the goddesses meet, 
Tenchi seeing this wants only to help even if he doesn't have the power 
of a goddess he still has the need to help, so he pulls up his light 
hawk wings and charges head on into the mass of energy building in the 
room.
As he leaps into the air after Tokimi she merle waves her hand knocking 
the young man back towards the massive energy, as he falls he forms his 
light hawk shield around him just as Tokimi sends another wave of dark 
energy into him knocking him back further. 
As he is consumed by the mass of energy formed by the three goddess 
"Tenchi noooooo!....." is the last thing he hears from two of the 
goddesses as he is fully consumed into the energy and as he enters the 
sphere of power it explodes.
 Tenchil looses consensus as darkness fills his mind thinking that this 
was the 
end....................................................................

                                                          Part:1
                                                      New Guest?

	He slowly opens his eyes as he hears a all to familiar voice 
screaming to other figures he couldn't quite make out besides one which 
was..... Ryoko. As he is rolled down a hallway he slowly painfully 
reaches his hand out and takes hold of the hand of the figure that 
looks like his Ryoko. "Ryoko....y..your alive....." Tenchi passes out 
his body exhausted and the pain from the burns overwhelming. 
"Alive what do you think he meant by that?" Tenchi looks to Washu with 
a confused gaze.
Ryoko looks at Tenchis hand on hers then to Washu who is now talking.
 "I don't know yet but with a few....test yes test then I will know 
hehe." 
"Washu!" Tenchi yells knowing how her test work.
"Hey I was just teasing Tenchi geez, I'll just run a routine body and 
mind scan to see what this guys story is ok? OK." The little red head 
looks to Tenchi then to the older looking one on the examination table. 
"You know Tenchi this guy looks a lot like you but he seems just a 
little older." 
Aeka pushes through and looks at the Tenchi on the table "What do you 
mean he looks like lord Tenchi he looks noth....oh...oh my." she places 
her hand to her moth as she gasp, for upon a closer look she too sees 
the unmistakable resemblance between the two. "M..m..m...miss.Washu can 
you shed a little light on what's happening?" Aeka looks over the 
unconscious Tenchi before she is shoved back.
 "NO! Not until you call me Little Washuuuuuuu!" Washu says as she 
claspes her hands together and smiles.
Aeka mumbles a little before putting on her best smile and bows "Little 
Washu could you please explain what's going on?" 
Washu pushes Tenchi,Aeka,Sassmie,and Ryo-okie to the door "Well I won't 
know anything until I can examine him without any interruptions" she 
proceeds by pushing them all out the door then turns to Ryoko who is 
now sitting on a floating pillow next to him, his hand still holding 
hers. "Ryoko that means you too...." 
Washu is stopped as he awakens for a moment looking to Ryoko again 
"Ryoko....please stay with me...Ry..." falls back into slumber and 
Ryoko tightens her grip on his hand.
 "Ok ok you can stay twist my arm will ya" snickers a little at her own 
humor but goes silent as she sees the look on her daughters face filled 
with such concern over this man that looked so much like their Tenchi, 
but was he she couldn't help but run that thought over and over in her 
mind, but decided to wait awhile and let him rest before running any 
type of TEST on him. 
"He is Tenchi." Ryoko turns to Washu who is now typing away at her halo 
lap top "I don't know how but he is my Tenchi." she gently puts her 
other hand on top of his and smiles slightly.
 "We'll soon know for sure my little Ryoko, but for now I think it best 
we let him rest agreed?" 
"Agreed." Ryoko nods slightly.
The lights around the lab table dim and another bed is pulled up for 
Ryoko to rest on, as the rest of the night goes on quietly.
 "Ah wait were is that Mihoshie" Washus eyes go wide in terrow.
BOOOOOOM!!!!! "Aaa Miss.Washu I was just trying to find my way out when 
I bumped into this strange looking thing and I thought it look a little 
dirty so when I went to whip it off well...." 
Washu smacks her forehead and sighs "Let me guess it just exploded 
right." 
Mihoshie just looks dumb founded then smiles brightly. "Gee wow Washu 
how did you know?" 
"I don't know Mihoshie, I don't know." 
Ryoko overhearing the incident can't help but giggle to herself before 
giving a glance over to Tenchi, then resting her eyes as she slowly 
drifted off to sleep. 
As the night went on only the soft typing could be heard from the 
little red head who was still busy at work trying to find something on 
their new guest, as the rest of the house slept through the night not 
sure of what tomorrow would bring with the new guest. 

 
***********************************************************************
 
The next day starts surprisingly quite as Ryoko is still asleep in the 
lab and not fighting with Aeka over who gets to sit closer to Tenchi at 
breakfast.
At the table Sasami is already setting up everything for everyone with 
Ryo-Okie in her child form helping in what ever way she can.
 "No no Ryo-Okie, you can't have any carrots until everyone else has 
waken up for breakfast."
The child cabbit sighs as she slowly puts the carrot back then quickly 
runs up the stairs to see what's taking so long, as she dashes up the 
stairs she runs past Aeka. 
"Now now Ryo-Okie if you keep running like that you might run into 
someone...like me." Aeka smiles lightly, teasing the child cabbit.
 "Meow" is all Ryo-Okie says as she smiles slowing herself down as she 
knocks on Tenchis door "Meow meow meeeooowww!"
 Tenchi opens the door slowly, rubbing his lightly reddened eyes as 
Ryo-Okie stars at him a little confused. "Meow?" 
Tenchi looks down at her and takes notice of this "Im fine Ryo-Okie, I 
just didn't get much sleep last night that man we found, I couldn't 
help but wonder where he came from, and how is it he looks so much like 
me you understand?" he looks down at her slightly confused face then he 
smiles reassuring her that he's all right as he rubs the top of her 
head "Anyway thanks for waking me up, I wouldn't want to miss one of 
Sasamis world renown meals." 
"MEOW!" is all she says before taking his hand and hurriedly guiding 
him down the stairs with a smile on her face. As they reach the bottom 
she turns back into her cabbit form and places herself on top of his 
head as he makes his way to the table and sits taking in the delicious 
smells coming from the kitchen.
 "Mmm. Sasami it smells great" he says smiling but as he looks around 
he notices someone missing besides Washu and his father which is 
normal. "Um...where is Ryoko she wasn't their when I woke up this 
morning like she always is?"
Aeka turns to him and gives him a cold star "What Do You Mean like she 
always is???" Tenchi gulps and smiles "I meant she wasn't at my door 
waiting for me like always."
She nods approvingly and smiles "My poor lord Tenchi always being 
harassed by that monster woman." 
"Aeka Im not harassed by Ryoko she just tends to play to much" he tries 
to explain.
Aeka turns her noise up "hmpf if you ask me she belongs back in that 
cave and not be allowed to Play with anyone." 
Sasami now walks in with a tray of delicious smelling food and looks 
sadly at her sister "Aeka that's not very nice you know how much she 
hates that cave, how would you feel if you were locked up for 700yrs 
with no one to play with?" she finishes as she places the food down and 
passes it around. 
"Oh all right I suppose that was a bit harsh, but really she needs to 
grow up and get better manners." 
Everyone nods not wanting to talk about the event anymore, a few quite 
moments go on as everyone at the table enjoys the meal before Lord 
Kashaetio enters and sits himself down next to a still sleepy Mihoshie.
 "Sorry Im late Sasami, I needed to sweep the stairs to the shrine that 
someone left unfinished." he speaks as he looks over and raises a brow 
at Tenchi who is cringing knowing that it was he that his grandfather 
was talking about.
 "I am sorry grandfather, but a event occurred that made me forget 
about my chores." 
Aeka turns to her brother and speaks on Tenchis behalf.  "Yes brother 
Yosho, a man looking much like lord Tenchi was unconscious not to far 
from Fanahoe."
The old man rest his eyes a moment and raises a brow taking in this new 
information before he starts on the tray of food now in front of him 
and Sasami smiles "Hmm, and where is Ryoko? I didn't see her when I 
came in."
 Aeka takes of sip of her tea and motions her head towards Washus lab 
door "The young man asked that Ryoko stay with him before he lost all 
conciseness, if you ask me..."
She was cut off by a stearn look from her brother that told her that, 
that was enough information so she went back to her food and the small 
group went on with their meal, and just before they were  finished with 
breakfast, Sasami wore a worried face as she took note that Ryoko and 
Washu still hadn't come up for breakfast and that the food was getting 
cold.
 As she was about to start cleaning off the table a small drone poped 
out of the closet door and held up a tray with a note "Sorry we 
couldn't make it to breakfest Sasamie, Im still running test over our 
guest and he still hasn't regained consisnuse so Ryoko won't leave his 
side, So could we please have some of your wonderful breakfest 
delivered to us. Just place the food on the drones tray and it will do 
the rest, Thanks!" the note was signed Little Washu and had a crab 
symbol on all four conners of the note. 
Sasamie smiled and put together two trays of food "I guess this is 
better than them not eating at all." Sasamie said to Ryo-Okie who was 
happely eating away at her carroit not a care in the world, seeing this 
caused Sasamie to giggle alittle as she put the last of the food on the 
drones tray with a note of her own. "Little Washu, I've put alittle 
extra food on the tray just in case our guest would like anything to 
eat. I hope to see you for lunch." 
She signed it and marked it with a little happy face, when all the food 
was ready and the note in place the little drone headed back for the 
lab door and was gone. The rest of the house finished breakfest and  
exchused themslelfs to freshen up then start on their chores.
 Around noon everyone started heading back for lunch not wanting to 
miss out on Sasamies wonderful cooking.
"Man I hadn't relized how late it was getting, I guess I have other 
things on my mind right now." Tenchi said to himself as he wiped the 
sweat from his brow and lifted the basket of carrots over his shoulder 
starting on his walk home, "I wonder if that guy really is me? well no 
point in dwelling on it, I'm sure Washu will have the answers for us." 
with that he found himself walking alittle faster than normal to get 
back to the house hopping to get the answers he asked himself. 
Sasamie was already starting to serve lunch as everyone started sitting 
themselfs around the table "I hope your all hungry I made a great lunch 
today." Sasamie said smiling her usally smile.
"Your meals are always great Sasamie." Tenchi said smiling as she set 
his tray down in front of him returning the smile.
"Yeah Sasamie your cooking is so yummy." added Mihoshie with a mouth 
full of fried shrimp.
"Really Mihoshie, you should learn to eat more appropriately." Aeka 
states taking a small bit of her food and smiles as she takes a much 
bigger bit, "Like myself." she finishes with her mouth full which 
causes everyone to laugh.
At that time Yosho walks in and takes in the wonderful arouma. "Mm, 
looks like I'm just in time." he takes his seat and poors himself some 
hot tea.
Sasamie bows and smiles "Well Im just glade you all like it so much." 
she takes her seat aside Ryo-Okie whom she places a bowl of carrots in 
front of.
"MEOW!" is all the child like Ryo-Okie says as she digs into the 
delicious bowl of carrots.
Sasamie giggles alittle before giving a quick sigh "I wonder if Ryoko 
and Washu will be joining us?" she looks to the two seats where Ryoko 
and Washu should be and sighs again.
"Don't worry Sasamie, I'm sure they'll be along shortly." Tenchi says 
smiling hopping to cheer the little princess up.
"Your right Tenchi I'm sure too." Sasamie nods and starts on her lunch.
Footsteps are heard as they all turned to the small sound of the closet 
door opening and the small scientist walking out followed by a mean 
faced Ryoko making sure the little red head went out first "OK Ok were 
out of the lab you can stop looking at me like that now." Washu said as 
she closed the door to her lab and made her way to the table still 
followed by her daughter.
 "Oh no, you think I'm letting you off that easy after what you did 
MOM." Ryoko said taking a sit right next to Washu instead of Tenchi 
like she normaly would which even Aeka seemed at a lose of words about.
 Washu started at the food now placed in front of her with Ryoko still 
eyeing her. 
"Im really glad you and Ryoko made it for breakfast Little Washu." 
Sasami said with one of her smiles that could make the most hateful of 
people break down and smile themselves. 
Washu smiled and looked at her daughter "Come on will ya, Its not nice 
to stare at someone, not to mention that someone being your mother when 
their trying to eat." Ryoko growled for a second before she rested back 
nibbling at her food. "Yeah well just remember Im keeping a(n) eye on 
you MOM." 
"Aww my little Ryoko is looking out for her mommy that's soo sweet" 
Washu chuckled as did Aeka.
Of course Tenchi knowing what this might lead to wanted to stop the 
fight before it started as he spoke to Washu. "So how is our guest 
doing?" he said with a claim smile to ease the mood of the room. 
Ryoko just smirked and looked at Washu. "Yeah Washu how is he doing?"  
Washu glared at her which made Ryoko sink back down into her sitting 
position and she cleared her throat to speak "Hmm well after a through 
examination..." 
"Through Examination!" Ryoko stood up looking down at Washu before 
noticing everyone looking at her then sat down again mumbling.
 "As I was saying...*looks to Ryoko to make sure she won't stop her 
again*...after a through examination. I have concluded that he is in 
fact Tenchi Masaki, only he is a few years older how much older I 
haven't found out yet...yet." 
Everyone in the room beside Yosho,Ryoko,and Washu fall over after 
hearing this news. "Wh..wh..what do you mean he's lord Tenchi?! I 
demand that you tell me at once...Wash...Little Washu...Please?" She 
looks over to the little red head who is still eating as though nothing 
happen. 
"I still don't know I have to run further....test." Washu shows a small 
grin.
"Oh no you don't! not like the one I caught you trying to do!" Ryoko 
eyeing Washu again. 
Tenchi now curious to find out why Ryoko is so mad at Washu about this. 
"Um...Ryoko why are you mad at Little Washu for? What did she do that 
got you all rallied up?"
Washu runs into Tenchi arms as if for protection. "I don't know Tenchi, 
Whats a mother to do. I need a husband in times like these." 
Tenchi verbally gulps as he is dumbfounded, rubbing the back of his 
head. "Oh boy."
"KNOCK THAT OFF!" Ryoko speaks as she balls her fist.
"Ah little Ryoko don't you want a daddy?" Washu looks at Ryoko grow 
more and more outraged "I guess not." Washu gives Tenchi a quick wink 
before she slowly moves back to her seat which causes Tenchi to sigh in 
relief.
"Ok now what happen, Ryoko?" Tenchi looks to Ryoko hopping to now get 
answers.
Ryoko grinds her teeth a little as she continues to eye her mother as 
she recalls what she woke up to "It all happen like this...." she goes 
on to explain what she awoke to.
Ryoko wakes up from her nap after breakfest and first thing she wants 
to look at is the young man that was in the bed next to her 
"Uh...what?" she looks over and find nothing but a empty bed and 
quickly turns her head as she hears her mother laughing playful and a 
man mumbling.
 "Come on, I know that your Tenchi, so as I see it if I can't get the 
final sample from the Tenchi now and you coming her and being nice 
enough to agree to let me procure it from you then my my good things 
really do come to those who wait hehe." Washu giggles like a excited 
child waking up for Christmas.
Tenchi manages to remove the gauge somewhat and pleads with the little 
red head "Washu what's gotten into you, you haven't done this in years 
and when did you become a child again!?!?" 
Washu looks puzzling at him before smiling "Oh silly Tenchi,*she taps 
him on the noise and evilly grins* now for my final sample hehe"
 Tenchi struggles to get free, fear rising up in him but finds himself 
still very much weakened from his past battle "Ack! Washu stop 
it...stay away from that." 
"Aw you don't mean that your just being naughty aren't you." She says 
with another evil grin. 
"NO! Im not come on let me go!" Tenchi says as he fights with what 
strenght he has.
Washu looks at him again then shakes her head with a smile "Oh I see 
playing innocent your such a naughty boy Tenchi."  As she reaches her 
hand down into his boxers she starts to feel around but before she can 
do anything she is quickly grab and held up to a very upset looking 
Ryoko.
 "What! do you think your doing?!" Washus legs are dangling as Ryoko 
holds her up. "J..just running a few test you know a little of this a 
little of that that's all" she speaks using a innocent voice 
"Test!...Test! it looked like a lot more than just a few test" Ryoko 
says bearing her teeth now.
Washu places her hands on her own cheeks and blushes "Oh my, little 
Ryoko you didn't think I was doing....that." she giggles and blushes 
again "Shame shame Ryoko you shouldn't be thinking of such things." 
Washu turns her gaze to meet her daughters and grins "Remember I know 
all about you." She says over their mental link. 
Ryoko lets her go and moves back a few steps looking at the little red 
head her jaw hanging open "You know about me being a v....." She cuts 
herself off realizing that Tenchi is still in the room.
 Washu nods in acknowledgment "I do." and with that she starts to walk 
off but is stop as Ryoko materializes in front of her.
 "Oh no you don't, your not getting off that easy." She gazes down at 
the little red head seriously.
 "Oh all right I'll let him go just give me a sec. will ya." She pulls 
up her holo-laptop and punches up a few keys and Tenchi is released and 
placed back on the bed, where he after checking himself over and giving 
a look to Washu and Ryoko.
"Night Night Tenchi." Washu says as she enters another command, which 
sends a robotic arm to administer a sedative to Tenchi.
"Wait...I still have ques...zzz." He finds himself  very tired and 
can't help it as he falls back to sleep exhausted from Washus Test.
 "See all better are you happy now?" 
Ryoko hovers around behind her and gently pushes her forward "Now we 
leave him alone MOM, after what you tried to do he deserves some rest 
so lets get some lunch before that pig Aeka eats it all." 
*cut back to the present* "WHAT! I am not a pig." Everyone looks at her 
"Shhh." then to Ryoko to finish. *back to Ryoko and Washu* 
Washu tries to move to the side "Ok but first I have to 
grab...something from my lab." As she starts to move around Ryoko her 
arm is grabbed and she is put back on course to the exit.
 "Ok ok ok, I guess I can always get it later. You know you really 
should trust your mother more often Ryoko" Ryoko remains quite as she 
watches her all the way out of the lab.
"And that's what happen" Ryoko finishes as she shoves a helping of 
noodles into her mouth and everyone sits back taking in this new 
information.
 "Hmpf I still say Im not a pig" she looks down to see Washu poking her 
stomach and sides.
 "Hmm I say only a few pounds off of a pig but close." The little red 
head stats in a scientific manner.
Washus hand is smacked away as Aeka gives her a scolding look and Washu 
plays innocent. "What I was only giving my expert opinion no need to 
get upset, and I didn't call you one I just said a few more pounds." 
She smiles as she moves behind Tenchi, just as logs start to form 
around Aeka.
 "Grrrraaa Miss.Washu! from now on keep your opinions to yourself 
understood?!" 
Washu peaks out from Tenchis shoulder smiling and nods knowing that 
Aeka would never or even really could hurt her it was still best to 
stay on her better side.
 Ryoko falls over giggling uncontrollable. "Aeka the pig haha that's 
rich!" she is now rolling around holding her sides with laughter before 
she is stop by Aeka who is now standing over her, her logs out in full 
force.
 "Miss Ryoko it is very rude for you to be laughing at the first crown 
princess of Juria and as so It is my duty to teach you some manners." 
Ryoko gives her a look before standing up eyeing the princess "Oh 
really and how do you plan on doing that Princess Piggy." Ryoko grins 
which bears her fangs as a few sparks fly from her hands as she builds 
up her power.
 "Silence." Aeka talks through her teeth.
Ryoko jumps back as a blue stream of energy flys towards her which she 
avoids easily as she fires one of her own back. 
"Here we go again Tenchi." Sasami looks over to Tenchi and sighs as 
they quickly duck behind the table.
 "What's wrong Ryoko old age making you slow" Aeka says as she sends 
her logs to grab her, but Ryoko phases out and back in, right in front 
of Aeka and grins.
 "Nope just letting you think you had a chance little princess." 
"Grrr monster." They both move outside the house and stand only a few 
feet from one another as they both build up their energy. 
At this time the Tenchi in the lab wakes up feeling that their is a 
battle going on, also his stomach wouldn't allow him to go back to 
sleep without some kind of food, he slowly gets up finding his clothing 
and gets his bearings after all he's been in Washus lab lots of times 
so he as a good idea where he's at. With that he makes his way 
hurriedly out of the lab to find out about the battle he is feeling and 
in doing so maybe get a quick bit to eat, he slowly opens to door and 
scans the room and is almost knocked back in shock as he 
sees...Sasami!? Cleaning up the mess the two combatants had left inside 
the house he was just about to walk out and talk to the young Sasami 
but his attention was now turned to the fight going on outside he could 
feel the power of the two fighters growing and though he doesn't know 
full well what's going on, yet he knows that he can't just sit by and 
let the fight go on in fear of someone getting hurt. So he decides to 
take action.
"Why hello..." Sasami smiles looking at the door as the young man steps 
out but she stops to get a look at him and notices he is in deep 
thought and just as she is about to speak again her eyes go wide in ahw 
as right before her eyes this man that looks soo much like Tenchi was 
changing as tree symbols on his forehead glowed in conjunction with one 
another and three light hawk wings were soon summoned and transformed 
the young man into the light hawk armor with shield and sword. 
"T...Tenchi?" Sasami looked next to her to see Tenchi, Ryo-Okie and the 
rest of the gang that was at the table all staring except for Washu, 
who was now very excited.
 "Oh my it seems he has complete control over his light hawk wings." 
Washu was smiling evilly as she asked her self so many question's about 
how he could do this and not the Tenchi now, was it training a 
traumatic episode or maybe a accident no matter she would find out "I 
want to make him mine!" 
Everyone didn't notice her talking, the were focused only on the man in 
front of them who could call on the power of the light hawk wings, but 
before any of the questions could come to light he went flying out the 
door at blinding speed.
 "Now miss Ryoko I will end this here and now." Aeka says as she puts 
her energy into form.
 "I agree this ends here and now little princess." Ryoko doing the same 
with her energy.
 The two gave each other one final look before using all their strength 
and hurled their energy at one another.
The energy formed by the two were hug, and as the two massive energy's 
fly at one another tearing up the ground as they built up speed each of 
the girls watched to see who would win.
Just as the two energies were about to collide a white light flashed 
and moved between the two massive energy blast and caused a blinding 
light, causing the girls to cover their eyes. 
After a few moments they removed their hands in surprise as their was 
no explosion no loud boom no nothing but both of their eyes went wide 
in seeing Tenchi with light hawk wings in full force around him, and 
they had adsorbed the blast from both of them. 
"Lord Tenchi?" "Tenchi?" They both looked at him as he powered down but 
still wore the light hawk battle gear.
Washu was already on the sidelines punching keys like a mad woman 
trying to take in all the data she could on what just happen. 
"That was incredible." The younger Tenchi came out and walk towards his 
older looking self who also looked confused now more than ever as he 
was seeing himself coming towards him. "Come inside, Im sure your just 
as confused as the rest of us are" Tenchi extends his hand to the other 
and smiles, and after a brief moment the two young men shake and go 
inside.
They are quickly followed by a still excited Washu, who is asking too 
many question before they even got in the house.
Meanwhile two other figures were still outside at a lose of words over 
what just happen "Aeka?..." Ryoko says looking to Aeka. 
"Yes Ryoko?" Aeka returns the stare.
 "You saw it to right? I mean we both saw Tenchi use the light hawk 
wings right?"
 "I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself he just 
stood their and withstood the full force of both of our blast." 
Ryoko snickers a little "I don't know about you but that wasn't my full 
power." 
Aeka only gives her a look not wanting to fight again. "What ever you 
say Ryoko, lets just go inside before Washu tries to do any of those 
test you were talking about earlier." Ryoko nods as the two girls head 
inside to house to find the answers to their many questions.
