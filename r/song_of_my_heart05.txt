Song of My Heart:  One True Melody

Ryoko sat on the roof. She and Hotsuma's confessions had happened several hours 
ago, but it was still sinking in for her, and then she said the one thing that 
could make it go wrong.... she told him she had feelings for another.  It 
couldn't go on like this, or she might be driven insane.  She had to follow one 
of her hearts melodys,  she had to find the true melody, the one true melody 
that would lead her to true love.

~*~

Was it true? She loved him the way he loved her? Or did she still love the boy 
named Tenchi? Hotsuma's mind was raceing with questions about the kiss, he and 
Ryoko's confession, Ryoko's feelings for Tenchi.  But she loved him, she said 
she did, they loved eachother, but she loved Tenchi  He was so confused, but 
then Sasami called for dinner, breaking his train of thought, and cutting off 
the questions that overwhelmed him.
"Thanks Sasami...." he mumbled. He was thankfull, he needed a break from all of 
this thinking.

~*~

The table was unusually quiet, for Ryoko and Ayeka weren't fighting.  Ryoko's 
behavior was also strange. instead of inhaleing her food, she simply picked at 
it, her mind was swirling just as Hotsuma's was.
"I'm full." Ryoko said, then sighed and got up.
"But Ryoko, you didn't eat anything!" said sasami worriedly, "are you ok Ryoko?"
"Hm? yea.. I'm fine... I just have a lot on my mind." Ryoko said as she walked 
up the stairs, and into her room, shutting the door behind her.

~*~

{hm... maybe it'll work....} Ryoko thought {I'll ask Yugi to help...}
Ryoko had been thinking of a game she had seen on TV, you ask a person a 
question, with 2 choices, they cant think about the answer, they just say the 
first 1 that comes to them.
Ryoko walked downstairs to see everyone just finishing dinner. "uh, Yugi could 
you help me with something?"
"um sure Ryoko, I'll be right there" Yugi said with a smile.
"Ok thanks, I'll be in my room." Ryoko said as she walked back into her room.

~*~

After 5 minutes Yugi walked into Ryoko's room, and shut the door, Ryoko handed 
her a pice of paper.  
"Read of the questions, don't let me think when I answer." Ryoko said as they 
both sat down in chairs faceing eachother.
"ok..." Yugi replyed as she took her seat. "hm.. What do you like better red or 
blue?"
"blue"
"What do you prefer? Sake or Tea?"
"sake"
"What would you rather do? sink or swim?"
"swim!"
"Who do you love more? Tenchi or Hotsuma?"
"Hotsuma!" Ryoko said, but then she slapped her hand over her mouth in shock of 
what she just said.
