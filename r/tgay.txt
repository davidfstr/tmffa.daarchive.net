                        Tenchi Gay?!

        It was any normal morning at the Masaki Residence. But little did they know
how suddenly this day would drastically change. Tenchi woke up to the sweet
smell of Sasami's cooking and as usual Ryoko's watchful eye's.
        "Ryoko! I thought I told you not to do that anymore!" Tenchi exclaimed.
        "But Teennchhii!" Ryoko moaned " What if Ayeka comes and gets you in the
night?"
        "Mmmm…Why do I have to live like this?" Tenchi muttered as he walked down the
hall to the bathroom.
        After several minutes Tenchi left the bathroom and      headed for the kitchen.
Ryoko stepped in directly after and immediately noticed the toilet seat down.
        "Wow I thought only girls put the seat down and I sure I heard him flush it"
Ryoko said with amazement.
        " Breakfast, everybody! " Sasami yelled as she slide the porcelain plates on
to the low wooden table.
        Everyone came rushing from all places to come eat Sasami's delicious
platter.
" Hmmm… " Tenchi said as he scarfed down Sasami's tasty food " so
Sasami , when are you going to teach me to cook like this ? "
        " Well , Tenchi , on Juria the women do all the cooking "
        " Well that's wh … " Tenchi started to blurt out before he stopped himself .
        " What was that , Tenchi ? " Washu asked .
        " Oh , nothing "

        Breakfast was over and everyone was starting their chores, all except Ryoko
of course whom quickly teleported next to Tenchi who was walking slowly upward
towards the shrine to sweep.
        "Tenchi" She said unusually girlish like "Let's get married!"
        " Rrrrrrrr " Tenchi growled "I confess, I confess to this world I'M
GAY!!!!!!!!!" He shouted with all his might and even the birds flew off in
fright from nearby trees.

        At the very next moment Ryoko did something she had not done in her whole
life…She fainted. Tenchi watched as Ryoko slowly rolled down some steps and
then stopped, only then did Tenchi notice that her skin was quite pale.
        Everyone came rushing at hearing the anger in Tenchi's voice.
        " Oh my, What happened to Ryoko? Are you all right Ryoko? Are you sleeping?"
Mihoshi  asked densely.
        "Lord Tenchi are you all right did that evil monster hurt you?!" Ayeka asked
worriedly.
        " I'm fine" Tenchi said angrily. "Just get Ryoko back to the house."
        "What happened" Sasami asked.
        "I'll tell you all later," he said in a low voice.
        "Just get Ryoko to the house" he said again as Washu somehow made Ryoko float
and head for the house with everyone following.

Ryoko's heavy eyelids started to open only to Tenchi's loving face hovering
over her with some other familiar faces.
"Gay?  gay!" Ryoko said tensely
" I'm sorry, Ryoko" Tenchi replied softly.
        " Really?"  Ryoko said as she put her arms around Tenchi 's neck, pulled him
down and gave him a big long French kiss.
Tenchi had never felt this way before .He never wanted it to end but Ayeka had
other plans she pushed Ryoko off of him but Ryoko retorted quickly and through
a fireball at Ayeka and hit her strait on. She did it, she had killed Ayeka. a
cheer rang out throughout the air " yeaaaaaaa , you killed her" the crowd
seemed to shout above Ryoko starting to kiss Tenchi once again.
"Hey you guy's what's going on" said Nobouki, as he had just walked in from a
long day of work.
"I'll show you what's 'going on'" Ryoko exclaimed happily who pulled a stunned
yet happy Tenchi for another deep kiss.
"Oohhhh" Said Nobouki with new understanding "Tenchi I'm so glad that you're
finally after all these beautiful girls now!"
"Nope just this one ,Dad" Tenchi said as he went to one knee and looked
intimately into Ryoko's soft yellow eye's "Ryoko will you please do me the
honor of letting me take your hand in marriage?".
After a moment Ryoko started smiling like no one had ever seen Ryoko smile
before. "YES TENCHI! I WILL MARRY YOU!! She said ecstatically.
"Good" Tenchi said plainly as he scooped Ryoko off her feet with and carried
her up the stairs and then stopped to look down on all the stunned people.
"I won't be coming down for a while" he said as Ryoko buried her face in
Tenchi's chest.
Tenchi turned and carried her to his room…oops! I mean THIER ROOM.

Dear Readers,
      Are wondering why this Fanfic is weird? It is because we wrote this at

loaded up the wazzoo with caffeine). We would like you to mail us your
comments at RYOKO (We are big fans) 39655@AOL.com or Blugoon  (don't ask)
