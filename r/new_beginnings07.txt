ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Dining room – DAY

Washu and Sasami sit at the table.

Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Ryoe walk in.

WASHU
Good morning.

RYOE
Good morning Little Washu, Sasami.

Sasami is red cheeked and staring into her lap.

Ryoko whispers into Mihoshi’s ear.

RYOKO
Sit in my place.

Ryoko sits between Washu and Sasami.

Mihoshi directs Ryoe to the opposite side of the table and both sit
down.

RYOKO
How are you feeling this morning Sasami?

SASAMI
I am sorry I barged in on you.

RYOKO
It’s okay Sasami.  I have nothing to hide from my youngest sister.

Sasami looks up at Ryoko.

RYOKO
You know I was pretty drunk last night and I couldn’t go to my bed.
Mihoshi carried me upstairs to her room to sleep it off.

WASHU
That’s the truth.

RYOKO
What do you mean by that?

WASHU
This breakfast is really good.  Eat it before it gets cold.

SASAMI
I am sorry.  I didn’t mean that you did anything wrong.  It is just
when I saw you two it reminded me of something I saw when I was young.

RYOKO
What was that?

SASAMI
I would like not to talk about it if that is okay.

RYOKO
Of course it is okay Sasami.  Just remember you can ask your oldest
sister anything.

SASAMI
Thank you Ryoko.

Ryoko gives Sasami a raised eyebrow look.

SASAMI
Thank you sister.

Everyone starts eating breakfast.

RYOE
Where are the two lovebirds?

SASAMI
I didn’t wake them.  I have set up some trays in the kitchen if they
come down.

Tenchi enters the dining room.

TENCHI
Good morning girls.

ALL FIVE GIRLS
Good morning Tenchi.

Tenchi walks over to Ryoko and gives her a kiss.

RYOKO
Sleep well Tenchi?

Tenchi chuckles.

SASAMI
Where’s Ayeka?

TENCHI
She is still in bed.

SASAMI
There are two trays in the kitchen for you Tenchi.

TENCHI
Thank you Sasami.

Tenchi exits the dining room for the kitchen.

He returns carrying two trays and leaves the dining room to go upstairs.

MIHOSHI
That’s so nice to serve Ayeka breakfast in bed.

INT. Family room – DAY

Mihoshi, Washu, Ryoko, Sasami, and Ryoe are enjoying tea as they watch
television.

A soap opera is on the television.

Ayeka enters the family room.

AYEKA
Am I in time for afternoon tea?

RYOKO
Yes, the program just started.

Ayeka sits down with the group.

A commercial comes on.

RYOKO
Help me in the kitchen Ayeka.

AYEKA
Okay.

Ayeka and Ryoko exit to the kitchen.

INT. Kitchen – DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko enter the kitchen.

In the center Ryoko turns to face Ayeka.

RYOKO
How did it go last night?

AYEKA
It was wonderful.  Thank you for not doing what I did to you.

RYOKO
It’s okay.  Mihoshi took me under her wing last night to ensure I did
not make a fool out of myself.

AYEKA
Hmmm.  I wonder about her.

RYOKO
Don’t worry about her.  She’s okay in my book.  I wanted to talk to
you about Tenchi.

AYEKA
I thought that is why you wanted me alone.

RYOKO
Here’s my deal.  You can have him on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
I get him on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  Sunday can be his day
of rest.

AYEKA
I can live with that.  Of course on Sunday we could both share his bed
in sleep or we could…

Ayeka turns red cheeked.

RYOKO
We could what?

Ayeka’s whole face is red.

AYEKA
I am sorry.  I remember you don’t care for Jurai customs.

Ryoko
What are you getting at Ayeka?

AYEKA
Well on Sundays we could spend time together to get to know each other.

RYOKO
Did Funaho and Misaki do that?

Ayeka nods her head.

RYOKO
Sasami saw me in bed with Mihoshi this morning.

Ayeka covers her mouth and gasps.

RYOKO
Mihoshi just gave me a place to sleep while you occupied the bedroom.
All we did was talk and sleep.  Anyway it seemed to upset Sasami when
she saw it.  She must have walked in on her mother.  I take it they
did more than just talk.

Ayeka nods her head again.

RYOKO
You are full of surprises princess.  Let’s get some snacks and go back
out to watch TV.

Ayeka and Ryoko gather up some snacks and exit the kitchen.

INT. Family room – DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko join the others watching television.

Mihoshi and Washu help themselves to the snacks.

RYOKO
How are you feeling Sasami?

SASAMI
I’m okay.

RYOKO
Just remember that when you ask Ayeka something and her tongue gets
all tied up you can come and ask me.

AYEKA
Not if she wants the truth.

RYOKO
I will never lie to Sasami and there is no question she can’t ask me.

AYEKA
When did you become an expert?

SASAMI
Ayeka, what’s it like sleeping with Tenchi?

Ayeka turns bright red.

AYEKA
Ah…  Ah… Ah…

SASAMI
Ryoko, what’s it like sleeping with Tenchi?

RYOKO
It is the most wonderful feeling I have ever had.  He is so caring
and gentle.  His kisses are better than sake…

AYEKA (overlapping)
Ryoko!  How can you talk like that in front of Sasami!

RYOKO
She asked the question and you couldn’t answer it.

AYEKA
I would have and I would have been more diplomatic about it.

RYOKO
We’ll have to talk later Sasami.

AYEKA
No you won’t.  She can ask me in private and I will answer her
questions.

SASAMI
Thank you both.  I’ll do just that.

AYEKA
Do what?

SASAMI
Ask you in private.

Ayeka smiles and nods her head.

Ryoko just smiles.

RYOE
You can ask me too Sasami.  That way it won’t get to Tenchi’s ears.

AYEKA
How can you say that Ryoe?  I do not gossip.

RYOKO
It’s okay with me Sasami if you want to ask Ryoe.  When Tenchi has me
in his arms I would tell him anything.

AYEKA
Ryoko!

Ryoko starts laughing and Ryoe and Sasami join in.

Ayeka finally gives in and joins the laughter.

MIHOSHI
What’s so funny?

WASHU
Don’t worry about it Mihoshi.  It is an area you don’t have much
experience in.

The girls laugh even harder.

INT. Master bedroom – NIGHT (Tuesday, 2 September 1997, 1st Day, 7th
Month)

Tenchi and Ryoko are in bed.

TENCHI
Ayeka told me the deal you worked out with her.

RYOKO
How were your two nights with Ayeka?

TENCHI
Why do you want to know?

RYOKO
Maybe she showed you something new that you could show me.

Tenchi’s face breaks out in a big grin.

TENCHI
Maybe.  Where have you been spending your time?  We both thought you
would show up last night.

RYOKO
I have set up a bed in Mihoshi’s room.  I enjoy talking with her.

TENCHI
I didn’t think you would have the patience to talk with Mihoshi.

RYOKO
You would be surprised at the things she knows.  I was.

TENCHI
Is Ayeka back with Sasami tonight?

RYOKO
Yes but I am sure she will be here before the nights over.

TENCHI
I won’t take you up on that bet.  I don’t know how to tell you this.

RYOKO
That you love Ayeka more than you thought.

TENCHI
How did you know?

RYOKO
I saw it in her face.

TENCHI
She is so lost and lonely.  But when we were together she came to
life in my arms.

RYOKO
I’m not jealous Tenchi.  I have grown to love her too.

TENCHI
You would like to know what we have been doing though?

Ryoko nods her head.

Tenchi pulls out the red silk cord from under his pillow.

RYOKO
I should have known this from the first day I met her.

INT. Dining room – DAY (Sunday, 7 September 1997, 6th Day, 7th Month)

Tenchi and the six girls sit at the table.  Tenchi sits between Ayeka
on his left and Ryoko on his right.  Across from him sit left to right
Sasami, Mihoshi, Washu, and Ryoe.  Ryo-Ohki in her girl form sits at
the end of the table farthest from the kitchen.  Grandfather’s spot
is empty.

SASAMI
When will Grandfather return to join us.

TENCHI
He told me that he has several things to take care of on Jurai before
he returns.

WASHU
I think the man is avoiding me.

TENCHI
Why do you say that Little Washu?

WASHU
I am getting as bad as Mihoshi talking without thinking.

RYOKO
Mom has a crush!

MIHOSHI
That is wonderful.  You two make a cute couple.

TENCHI
Is this my Grandfather we are talking about?

WASHU
What’s wrong Tenchi?  Do you think he is too young for me?

TENCHI
I…  It is that…  Well…

WASHU
Did you think that I was going to make a move on you?

Tenchi turns red.

TENCHI
Well, yes.  All those times you played nurse and the experiments.
I thought well, you know.

WASHU
Sorry Tenchi but I draw the line at 500 years.  Anyone younger than
that would be cradle robbing.

RYOKO
So have you told him how you feel mom?

WASHU
Oh yes, I have indeed.  His ghosts from the past still haunt him like
they haunt me.  And maybe it is just wishful thinking on my part.

AYEKA
Would you like for me to talk to Funaho Ms. Washu?

WASHU
Not yet Ayeka.  I will hold that for my trump card.

INT. Family room – NIGHT

Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Washu watch television.

RYOKO
So, Ayeka, what will we do tonight.

AYEKA
What do you mean?

RYOKO
Where are we sleeping?

AYEKA
Oh.  I haven’t thought about that.

WASHU
What’s wrong with the master bedroom?

AYEKA
It is Tenchi’s night off.

MIHOSHI
You can stay in my room.

RYOKO
There isn’t enough room for three.

MIHOSHI
I could stay with Sasami tonight.

AYEKA
I should be the one staying with Sasami.  Ryoko can stay with Mihoshi.

MIHOSHI
I though you two wanted to spend some time together?

AYEKA
Where did you hear that!?

RYOKO
I told you she knows everything.

WASHU
What if I gave you a place in sub-space where no one can spy on you?

RYOKO
Including you, mom?

WASHU
I am hurt.  How can my baby say such terrible things about me?

RYOKO
Yeah, right.  Give it a rest mother.

AYEKA
I think I will go with Mihoshi’s plan.  I need to ask Sasami first.

MIHOSHI
I have already done that.

AYEKA
You asked Sasami already?

MIHOSHI
Well actually, she asked me.  Isn’t that so sweet of her?

RYOKO
I am telling you princess that sister of yours is not nearly as naïve
as you were.

Ayeka jumps to her feet.

AYEKA
Naïve!  I will give you naïve!

Ryoko jumps to her feet.

RYOKO
Bring it on sister.

WASHU
Would you two stop it!  I am trying to watch this show.

MIHOSHI
I want you both to promise me you won’t break anything in my room.

Ayeka and Ryoko stare at Mihoshi.

RYOKO
What were we fighting over again?

AYEKA
You called me a name.

RYOKO
Oh yeah, that’s right.  Well whatever I called you it’s the truth.

AYEKA
I think you may be right about that.

RYOKO
Let’s go to bed.  And yes Mihoshi, I will not break any of your things.

AYEKA
Good night.

Ayeka and Ryoko leave the room.

MIHOSHI
Do you think they will survive the night?

WASHU
Yes they will.  Now tell me about those nights you spent with Ryoko.

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu you’re embarrassing me.

INT. Mihoshi’s bedroom – NIGHT

Ayeka and Ryoko walk into the room.

RYOKO
So what do we do now?

AYEKA
I don’t know.

RYOKO
You don’t know?  Didn’t your mother prepare you for this occasion?

AYEKA
No, we never talked about this part of her life.  I was hoping someone
with your experience would know what to do.

RYOKO
I am sorry Ayeka, but I am not into this.

AYEKA
I am not sure what to do next.

RYOKO
Tell you what.  We can do what Mihoshi and me do.

Ayeka’s face turns red.

Ryoko undresses and get into bed.

RYOKO
Well princess what do you need an engraved invitation?

Ayeka undresses down to her undergarment.

She gets into bed next to Ryoko.

Ayeka looks very stiff.

RYOKO
You know there is a second bed in this room.

AYEKA
You want me to move?

RYOKO
I want you to be comfortable.

Ayeka turns red faced again.

AYEKA
I don’t know what to do.

RYOKO
Tell me about your childhood.

AYEKA
You just want to talk?

RYOKO
How better to get to know each other.

Ayeka looks down at her hands.

RYOKO
Do you remember that time in the dimension tuner?

AYEKA
I thought we agreed to never talk about that.

RYOKO
It was Sasami’s wish that we wouldn’t fight any more.

AYEKA
She had a strange way to show us.

RYOKO
Was it that bad?

Ayeka turns bright red.

AYEKA
No.

RYOKO
I feel like we are in the tuner again.  Like all of this is a
wonderful dream.

AYEKA
I am scared Ryoko.  I am so very scared.

Ryoko hugs Ayeka, and gently rocks her back and forth.

RYOKO
Just go to sleep now.  It will be all right.

INT. Sasami’s room – NIGHT

Mihoshi and Sasami lie next to each other on separate futons.

SASAMI
What do you think they are doing now?

MIHOSHI
Does it really matter, Sasami?

SASAMI
No, I am just curious.  I remember what I did to them in Washu’s
dimensional tuner.

MIHOSHI
I am sure that neither of them wants that brought up again.

SASAMI
They looked so happy together, and now they are together with Tenchi.

MIHOSHI
Do you envy them?

SASAMI
Everyone thinks I’m too young.

MIHOSHI
You are young Sasami.

Sasami is about to speak but Mihoshi raises her hand.

MIHOSHI
You love him don’t you Sasami?

SASAMI
Yes, I do.

MIHOSHI
I love him also, and he loves both of us.  For now that has to be
enough.  If you want more you are being selfish.  That is why I am
happy knowing he loves me.  I do not need anything more from him to
prove it.

SASAMI
I just want him to hold me and kiss me and whisper sweet words in
my ear.

MIHOSHI
Just give it time Sasami.  You will make a wonderful third wife for
him one day.

SASAMI
You mean that?

MIHOSHI
Yes I do Sasami.  It is getting late.  Good night.

SASAMI
Good night.  Thank you Mihoshi.

INT. Small bar – NIGHT

Kazuhiko, Azaka, Kamidake, and Grandfather sit at a small table.

Each is holding a drink.

KAZUHIKO
Why are we here again?

AZAKA
We are on a mission.

KAZUHIKO
And what is our mission this time?

Grandfather raises his glass.

GRANDFATHER
To forget.

KAZUHIKO
This stuff doesn’t make you forget.  It makes you regret.

KAMIDAKE
Spoken like a true sage.

GRANDFATHER
Why are you here Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
A friend needed me.

Grandfather nods his head.

WASHU (O. C.)
That is a very good reason.

Grandfather stands and spins around.

The other three men stand.

INT. Small bar – NIGHT

Grandfather, Azaka, Kamidake, and Katsuhiko stand around a small table.

Little Washu stands a few feet in front of Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Hello Washu.  I must say I am surprised you found me here.

AZAKA
Lady Washu would you please join us.

WASHU
No thank you boys.  I have just stopped by to see if an old friend
still has time for me.

GRANDFATHER
Find someone who is worthy to be your friend.

WASHU
By that standard it only leaves Tenchi, and he is already my friend.

Azaka takes Kazuhiko and Kamidake by the arm.

GRANDFATHER
He could be more.

Azaka, Kazuhiko, and Kamidake quietly move away from the table.

WASHU
Friendship is all I want from him.  The same can’t be said of you.

GRANDFATHER
You don’t know me Washu.

WASHU
Why must young people be so full of themselves?  I would like to know
you Yoshou, wrinkles and all.

GRANDFATHER
I am not good enough for you Washu.

Washu throws back her head and laughs.

WASHU
There is no one in the universe good enough for me so I will just have
to make due with what I can find.

GRANDFATHER
Why me?

WASHU
I love you, you idiot.

Washu takes Grandfather’s hand.

A portal opens up behind her.

WASHU
I won’t force you.

Washu lets go of Grandfather’s hand.

She steps through the portal.

Grandfather sees the adult Washu through the portal.

Grandfather steps though the portal.

The portal vanishes.

INT. Small bar – NIGHT

Azaka, Kazuhiko, and Kamidake stand at the bar.

KAMIDAKE
I guess we can go back to our original mission now.

KAZUHIKO
Good, I am sure there are many more lonely damsels out there.

Azaka raises his cup.

AZAKA
To success!

FADE OUT:

END ACT ONE



ACT TWO

FADE IN:

INT. Dining room – DAY (Monday, 22 December 1997; 22nd Day, 10th Month)

The sounds of Mihoshi and Sasami preparing breakfast can be heard.

Ayeka and Ryoko enter the dining room.

Sasami and Mihoshi enter the dining room carrying breakfast.

Sasami has her hair styled like Ayeka’s.

RYOKO
That’s a good look for you Sasami.

AYEKA
Sasami why have you changed your hair?

Mihoshi starts giggling.

SASAMI
Today I am a woman.

AYEKA
You mean you have started your cycle.

Sasami nods her head.

SASAMI
Mihoshi took care of me, and she let me have some of her stuff.

AYEKA
I’m sorry Sasami.  I should have been there for you.

Tenchi and Ryoe enter the dining room.

TENCHI
Good morning everyone.

RYOE
Good morning.

RYOKO
Ayeka what are you talking about?

AYEKA
What do you mean Ryoko?  Sasami has become a woman.  She has started
her cycle.

Tenchi’s mouth drops open.

TENCHI
Do you have to talk about that at breakfast?

RYOKO
Sorry.  Still don’t follow you.

RYOE
Congratulations Sasami.

SASAMI
Thank you Ryoe.

RYOKO
Tenchi, do you know what they are talking about?

TENCHI
Ah… Ah… Ah…

RYOKO
You sound like Ayeka talking about sex.

Both Tenchi and Ayeka turn bright red.

AYEKA
Really Ryoko how can you be so thick?

RYOKO
Give me a break!  Just tell me why everyone is congratulating Sasami.

AYEKA
Sasami has started menstruating.

Tenchi falls to the floor.

RYOKO
Menstruating, what’s that?

All the girls go silent as they stare at Ryoko.

RYOKO
Why is everyone looking at me?

RYOE
You don’t menstruate?

Ryoko shakes her head.

RYOKO
No, I am not certain what it means.

TENCHI
Hold it right there.

RYOE
If you can’t handle the conversation you can be excused.

TENCHI
It’s not that.  I know why Ryoko doesn’t have a clue what you are
talking about.

RYOKO
Good.  Maybe you can let me in on their secret.

TENCHI
It’s your secret that they need to know about Ryoko.  The one Washu
told us.

Ryoko looks stunned.

RYOKO
Is this why they can become pregnant?  Even Sasami can get pregnant now?

SASAMI
Yes I can Ryoko, but I don’t understand why it is a surprise to you.

RYOKO
It’s not fair.

MIHOSHI
What’s not fair Ryoko?

Ryoko begins to cry.

Tenchi gathers Ryoko up in his arms.

TENCHI
Ryoko has never ah…  Menstruated.

RYOE
How can that be?  She must be old enough.

TENCHI
Ryoko can’t conceive a child.  She was never meant to have any children.

Sasami runs over to Ryoko and hugs her.

SASAMI
I’m so sorry sister.  I didn’t know.  I didn’t want to hurt you.

Ayeka walks over and hugs Ryoko.

AYEKA
Please forgive me sister.  I am sorry I know you wanted children.

Mihoshi starts crying.

RYOKO
Thank you, I understand now.  I can still get pregnant.  It will be
someone else’s egg though.

AYEKA
Someone else’s?

Ryoko looks Ayeka in the eye and shakes her head.

RYOKO
So what does Jurai custom say we should do to celebrate this occasion?

AYEKA
We should go out and have a big party.  Sorry Tenchi but men are not
invited.

TENCHI
I think I can pass this party up without getting too upset.

AYEKA
Ryoko would you contact Washu.  I will call Funaho and Misaki.  Where
do you want to go Sasami?

SASAMI
I don’t know of any good places on Jurai.  Let’s ask Funaho.  The
breakfast is getting cold.

Everyone sits down and begins eating breakfast.

INT. Family room – DAY

A Christmas tree stands in one corner.

Tenchi sits on the couch eating noodles.

Grandfather walks into the room.

GRANDFATHER
So all the girls are out celebrating.

TENCHI
Welcome back home Grandfather.  Yes they are celebrating Sasami’s
coming of age.

GRANDFATHER
My youngest sister is not so young anymore.

TENCHI
Hard to believe how much time has passed since I first met her.  Ah, did
you know that Little Washu is looking for you?

GRANDFATHER
Oh.  Why is she looking for me?

TENCHI
I think she would like to be my grandmother.

GRANDFATHER
What do you think of that?

TENCHI
It’s your life Grandfather.  Or at least that’s what you tell me all
the time.  I believe that you will have to listen to your heart on
this one.

GRANDFATHER
It has been so long since I last listened to my heart.  I nearly
destroyed Ayeka for it.

TENCHI
But you didn’t destroy her.  And Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
Yes Tenchi.

TENCHI
It would upset me if you destroyed Little Washu.

GRANDFATHER
Well I most certainly do not want to upset the Crown Prince of Jurai.

TENCHI
That is not my job title Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
It will be after you marry Sasami.

TENCHI
Grandfather!

Grandfather
What Tenchi?

TENCHI
I think of Sasami as my little sister.  I am not sure when I will stop
seeing her that way.  Maybe I will marry her some day.

GRANDFATHER
How do you feel about her?

TENCHI
I probably feel the same way about her as you do about Little Washu.
I love her but I am afraid to act on that love.

GRANDFATHER
Touché Tenchi.  What do we do now?

TENCHI
I still have the luxury of time Grandfather.  You do not.

GRANDFATHER
When do we return to Earth?

TENCHI
After Daijiro has been revived.  I owe it to Funaho to introduce him.

GRANDFATHER
Then I still have a little time before I must decide.

INT. Dining room – DAY (Wednesday, 24 December 1997; 24th Day, 10th Month)

The family is gathered for Christmas Eve dinner.

Grandfather sits at the end of the table nearest the kitchen.  On
Grandfather’s right sit Ayeka, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ryoe, and Kazuhiko.
On his left sit Washu, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki in her girl form, Mihoshi,
and Kiyone.  At the other end are two empty place settings.

Tenchi raises his glass.

TENCHI
Much has happened since we last gathered for Christmas.  To family,
each and every one of you here, and in our hearts.

GROUP
To family.

TENCHI
I am glad you were able to make for Christmas Kiyone.

KIYONE
It was a lesson I learned from Mihoshi.  I simply took off leaving
a message behind that I was on leave.

MIHOSHI
Kiyone!

KIYONE
It was fun.  So how is married life treating you Tenchi?  I hope you
have some photos from Ayeka’s and Ryoko’s wedding for me to look at.

TENCHI
I am happy Kiyone.  We should have lots of photos.  We can look at them
after dinner.  How long can you stay?

KIYONE
As long as I want, or until they find me.

RYOKO
Let’s do karaoke tonight.

MIHOSHI
You only said that because Kiyone is here.

KIYONE
I am not that good.  That’s one reason I gave the machine to you.

RYOKO
I know that.  You are the only one here that can challenge me for
last place.

Everyone except Ryoko and Kiyone start laughing.

KIYONE
What’s so funny?

RYOKO
Either one of us singing is funny.

AYEKA
You could be dancing instead Ryoko.  That would truly be funny.

SASAMI
Yes let’s dance tonight.

WASHU
With eight of us, and three of them we could go all night.

TENCHI
Why do I think this is going to be a long night?

KAZUHIKO
Be brave Tenchi.  We can save these poor damsels from a lonely fate.

This is beautiful.  Where did you get it?

Oh my, that is a question you should never ask a space pirate.

Ryoko walks over to Grandfather and gives him a deep bow.

RYOKO
This is for you Grandfather.

She hands him an envelope.

Grandfather opens the envelope and reads the card.

Grandfather returns the bow.

His eyes grow misty.

GRANDFATHER
Thank you Ryoko.

RYOKO
You are welcome Grandfather.

Ryoko walks back to the tree and picks up a box.

RYOKO
I’ll be right back, just need to pop Father’s present in the mailbox.

Ryoko walks out to the foyer.

You can hear the sound of the mailbox opening and closing.

Ryoko walks back into the room.

She walks over to Tenchi and sits in his lap.

It is a lacquered Jurai Life Tree leaf hanging by its stem.

No, but you can guess who it will be.

She loves you Tenchi.

TENCHI
It is too soon.

Ryoko joins Tenchi in bed.

RYOKO
Tenchi?

TENCHI
Yes.

RYOKO
Will you ever get mad at me?

TENCHI
Yes Ryoko I may get mad at you for some reason I don’t know yet, but
then we can have a chance to make up.  Why do you ask?  Did you do
something that is going to make me mad?

RYOKO
I don’t know Tenchi.  I can only do what is best for you.

TENCHI
If you do that Ryoko I will not get mad.

I love you Tenchi.

just stay with me and hold my hand.

TENCHI
I don’t understand Sasami.

SASAMI
Do you know when it was that you last kissed me?

Tenchi looks at Sasami and sees she is wearing lipstick.

TENCHI
I ah…  Well it was when…

SASAMI
It was when father took our photos on the front porch.

TENCHI
Oh.

SASAMI
Tell me what you feel when you kiss Ayeka and Ryoko.

TENCHI
Sasami I don’t think I should be talking to you about that.

SASAMI
Do you want me to go out on the streets and find the answer?

TENCHI
Sasami please don’t do that.  I take it Ryoko knows you are here what
about Ayeka?

SASAMI
Yes, but she is not happy about it.

TENCHI
Who else knows?

SASAMI
You can’t keep secrets in this house Tenchi.

TENCHI
Okay Sasami I will try.  Let me take you somewhere?

Are we embarrassing you Kazuhiko?

KAZUHIKO
How can a man be embarrassed when six beautiful women surround him!

Ryoe blushes.

Mihoshi has a fit of giggles.

AYEKA
Where is Sasami?

KIYONE
She and Tenchi went down to the planet.

AYEKA
What!?

RYOKO
Chill out.  They will be fine.

AYEKA
But what if Tenchi does something to her.

RYOKO
This is Tenchi we are talking about.  The man you married correct?
He will not do anything to harm Sasami in any way.

MIHOSHI
I trust Tenchi to do the right thing.

WASHU
Yes my little guinea pig will treat Sasami to some one on one attention
she can’t get from anyone else.

KIYONE
I agree that Tenchi will be the complete gentleman.

Ayeka looks at her lap and begins to cry.

Ryoko hugs Ayeka close.

RYOKO
Sasami’s honor is not in jeopardy.

AYEKA
Okay.

KAZUHIKO
I am happy for Sasami.

Ayeka looks at Kazuhiko.

KAZUHIKO
I can sense the friendship between Sasami and Tenchi runs very deep.
I have known lovers who did not share such feelings.

Ryoe nods her head and begins to cry.

RYOE
That is the feeling Daijiro and I shared.  It was the reason we got
married at such a young age.

WASHU
That feeling will remain with him Ryoe.

Ayeka looks at Ryoko.

AYEKA
I am scared sister.

Ryoko holds Ayeka to her chest and kisses the top of her head.

Ayeka, Ryoko, Washu, Mihoshi, Ryoe, and Kiyone sit in the hot spring.

I can’t imagine a better present than this.  Can you install one of
these on Yagami Little Washu?

WASHU
I could make you a smaller version if you like.

AYEKA
What are they doing now?

MIHOSHI
Who Ayeka?

RYOKO
Don’t tease her Mihoshi.  This took everything I had to set up.  What
is the worst thing that could happen, Ayeka?

Ayeka starts to cry.

RYOKO
Now imagine the best thing for Sasami.  If you love her you will keep
that image in your mind because that is what Tenchi is doing right now.

RYOE
Why don’t you say what you are really afraid of Ayeka?

The five girls all look at Ryoe.

Ayeka opens her mouth but she can’t say anything.

Ayeka starts shaking her head and begins to sob.

RYOKO
What are you suggesting Ryoe?

RYOE
I can read her like a book but she has to admit to it before we can
help her.

WASHU
Tells us your fears Ayeka.  You're with family here.

Mihoshi moves over to Ayeka and touches her face.

MIHOSHI
He loves you Ayeka.  You must hold onto your trust in him.

AYEKA
Sasami will take him away from me!  She will take him away from all
of us!  Can’t you all see that!  She is better than any of us!

Mihoshi hugs Ayeka to her chest silencing her.

WASHU
Sasami is truly better than any of us.

RYOKO
She is so much better than us she would never hurt us.  My love for
Tenchi will not die even if he makes Sasami his only wife.

RYOE
There Ayeka it is in the open now.  The light of day will make this
evil thought evaporate.

Ayeka is sobbing into Mihoshi’s chest.

KIYONE
I should have never left Mihoshi.  Why has my ambition so blinded me?
It has separated me from all of my true friends.  From those who like
me as I am.

Ryoko reaches out and touches Kiyone.

RYOKO
You are always welcome here Kiyone.

Ayeka regains her composure
.
AYEKA
Thank you all very much.  I don’t deserve friends like you.

KIYONE
None of us deserve each other.  That is what makes our friendship
so great.

EXT. Park – DAY

Tenchi and Sasami sit on a bench eating breakfast.

TENCHI
This Jurai food is pretty good, but not as good as what you make.

SASAMI
Thank you Tenchi.  Can we talk now?

TENCHI
Yes Sasami you can ask me anything.

SASAMI
Do you love Ayeka?

TENCHI
Yes Sasami I do.  When we first met I was scared of her.  Later I grew
to like her.  After the marriage I have grown to love her deeply.

SASAMI
Why did you marry her when you did not love her?

TENCHI
Love is only one part of life.  It makes life more enjoyable but you
can go on without it.  Ayeka needed me more than anything in the
universe.  Our time together has blossomed into love.

SASAMI
Do you love Ryoko?

TENCHI
Yes.  I loved her the moment I saw her in my schoolyard.  No, that is
not right.  I lusted for her then, and I grew to love her over time.

SASAMI
Do you love me?

TENCHI
I love you Sasami, but I do not love you the way I love Ayeka and Ryoko.
I am sorry if I hurt you.

SASAMI
No you didn’t hurt me Tenchi.  I now know that love grows where it is
absent.  I love you Tenchi.  I love you so much that I would give my
body to you.

TENCHI
You know I can’t take it.  Time may change the way I feel.  I would be
proud to have you as my third wife, but I am not ready to commit to
that now.

SASAMI
I understand.  How much longer must I wait?

TENCHI
I don’t know Sasami.  Please forgive me, but I don’t know.

Sasami looks up into Tenchi’s eyes.

Tears form in the corners of Sasami’s eyes.

Tenchi kisses Sasami.

He holds the kiss for several moments.

They part.

SASAMI
I could go on forever.

TENCHI
What else do you wish to talk about?

SASAMI
Tell me how you feel when you make love to my two sisters.

TENCHI
Okay Sasami.  You must understand that what I say is from my heart and
may not make any sense.

SASAMI
Yes Tenchi.

INT. Dining room – NIGHT

Four large pizzas are on the table.

Grandfather sits at the head of the table near the kitchen.  To his
left sit Ayeka, Ryoko, and Ryoe.  To his right sit Washu, Kiyone,
and Mihoshi.  Kazuhiko sits at the other end.

GRANDFATHER
I don’t like to admit it but I love pizza.

AYEKA
Where did this come from anyway?

WASHU
I asked Funaho.  She has started several new trends here on Jurai.

RYOKO
I hope Tenchi gets back soon.  He loves pizza also.

Mihoshi’s bracelet beeps.

MIHOSHI
Well you get your wish Ryoko.

Mihoshi touches her bracelet.

Tenchi and Sasami enter from the family room.

TENCHI
Pizza!  I haven’t had pizza in ages.

AYEKA
Hello Tenchi, Sasami.  How are you both doing?

Sasami blushes.

SASAMI
We are doing very well thank you.

Tenchi sits between Ayeka and Ryoko while Sasami sits between Washu
and Kiyone.

Ryo-Ohki charges into the room and wraps Sasami up in a hug.

SASAMI
Did you miss me Ryo-Ohki?

RYO-OHKI
Miya!

Ryo-Ohki sits between Sasami and Kiyone.

TENCHI
Thank you for the Christmas surprise this morning Ryoko.

Ryoko lays her head on Tenchi’s chest.

RYOKO
It had to be done sooner or later.  I could not think of a better time.
Neither Ayeka nor myself could answer the questions she had.

TENCHI
I understand.  I think Sasami and me understand each other too.

Ayeka touches Tenchi’s cheek.

They look each other in the eye.

TENCHI
I would never do anything to bring dishonor to the house of Jurai.

Ayeka looks down and begins to cry.

Tenchi holds her close.

TENCHI
It’s okay Ayeka.  Trust is a fragile thing that must be strengthened
every day.

AYEKA
I am so very scared Tenchi.  The future was once laid out before me.
Now I do not know what it may bring next.

TENCHI
I love you Ayeka.  Hold on to that.

Tenchi stands scooping Ayeka up in his arms.

TENCHI
Could you bring some pizza up to our room please?

RYOKO
Of course Tenchi.

Tenchi leaves the room.

Ryoko gathers several slices of pizza and follows.

WASHU
Sasami can we talk later?

SASAMI
Not right now Ms. Washu.  I still need time to think about what
happened today before I could tell anyone else.

MIHOSHI
Oh!  I wanted to hear all about it.

SASAMI
It was very romantic and I had a wonderful time, and yes he kissed me.

KIYONE
Romance in full bloom is a lovely sight.

Washu raises a hand to her face and stands.

She has turned bright red.

RYOE
What’s wrong Little Washu?

WASHU
Tenchi has changed the rules again.

Washu runs out of the room.

Grandfather stands and follows Washu out of the room.

KAZUHIKO
I don’t mind you talking like I am not here, but what is going on?

Ryoe and Kiyone shake their heads.

Mihoshi and Sasami look at each other and start giggling.

SASAMI
I think I will have the room to myself tonight.

Mihoshi and Sasami’s giggles grow into full-blown laughter.

KAZUHIKO
I still don’t get it.

KIYONE
Well we won’t get anything else out of those two.  Who wants to watch
some TV before bed?

Kazuhiko, Ryoe and Kiyone all exit the dining room.

Once Mihoshi and Sasami regain their composure they follow.

INT. Family room – NIGHT

Kiyone, Ryoe, Kazuhiko, Mihoshi, and Sasami sit watching television.

An action adventure is on the TV.

The show ends.

KAZUHIKO
Well, good night girls.

GROUP
Good night Kazuhiko.

Kazuhiko leaves the room and heads upstairs.

RYOE
He has changed a lot since school.  He has really grown up.

SASAMI
That is Kamidake and Azaka’s influence on him.

KIYONE
How are you doing Ryoe?

RYOE
It is lonely sometimes.  I only go to the lab every other day now.
Waiting is so painfully slow.

MIHOSHI
If you need someone to talk to you could always spend the night with me.

SASAMI
You could stay in my room too Ryoe.  Tonight would be a good night since
I will be alone.

RYOE
I don’t know about that.

MIHOSHI
You’re embarrassing me.  I thought you would like to talk to someone
who will listen.  Nothing more Ryoe.

Sasami nods her head.

RYOE
I’m sorry.  I’m not used to dealing with people from other worlds.

KIYONE
I will tell you for a fact that you won’t find better friends anywhere
else than here.

MIHOSHI
You are so sweet Kiyone.

RYOE
I will take you up on that offer Sasami.

All four girls exit the room.

INT. Washu’s lab – DAY (Saturday, 27 December 1997; 27th Day, 10th Month)

Washu sits at her keyboard with her hands behind her head daydreaming.

Ryoko enters the lab.

RYOKO
How are you doing mother?

WASHU
How nice of you to ask Ryoko.  Did you have a pleasant experience
last night?

RYOKO
I am used to you eaves dropping on me.  What I am not used to is the
feedback I got from you last night.

WASHU
What are you saying?

RYOKO
You normally block your link to me so that I can’t feel what you are
doing.  Last night you let your guard down, and I can’t say what it
did to me.

WASHU
I will try to be more careful.

RYOKO
Is what I felt what you have been feeling since I married Tenchi?

Washu nods her head.

RYOKO
Do you want the link broken?  I am sure you could do it if you wanted to.

WASHU
I could.  Do you want it broken Ryoko?

RYOKO
No, I don’t mind the link and it is to valuable to throw away.  Can you
teach me to block it from my end?

WASHU
I don’t know how I do it.  I don’t know if you can do it at all.

RYOKO
That’s okay mom.  Just keep living life to its fullest.  Sasami has
breakfast ready.

WASHU
I will be out in a minute.

RYOKO
I love you mother.

Ryoko exits the lab.

Washu sighs deeply.

WASHU (expressed as thought)
I love you too daughter.

Tenchi and Ayeka enter the room.

TENCHI
Isn’t this Ryoko’s night?

Tenchi starts to undress.

AYEKA
Ryoko gave me tonight because I didn’t get last night to myself.

TENCHI
Are you upset about last night?

Ayeka blushes.

AYEKA
No.

Tenchi the leaf locket off and sets it on the dresser.

AYEKA
That is a beautiful locket.

TENCHI
Yes it is a beautiful gift from Ryoko.

Tenchi turns to look at Ayeka.

Ayeka has her head down holding her pendent.

Tenchi pulls a sweater out of the dresser.

TENCHI
But when I touch this gift I can feel the love that went into it.
A love that can’t be bought in any store.

Ayeka looks up at Tenchi.

There are tears in her eyes.

AYEKA
I love you Tenchi.  You are my world.

Tenchi moves over and hugs Ayeka.

AYEKA
What have you decided about Sasami?

TENCHI
We both need more time to make sure we do the right thing.  Does it
bother you Ayeka?

AYEKA
I would be lying to say no.  My sister is not so little anymore, is she?

TENCHI
No, she is growing up quickly.

AYEKA
Ryoko had another reason to give me this night.

Tenchi gets into bed.

TENCHI
Oh, and what was that.

AYEKA
I did not have a chance to show you the present she got for me.

Ayeka moves into the bathroom.

Tenchi has a puzzled look on his face.

A moment later she steps out.

Ayeka has tiger ears on her head and is wearing a tiger striped teddy.

A pair of tiger striped fur covered handcuffs dangle from her right hand.

TENCHI
Can I be your mouse Ayeka?
