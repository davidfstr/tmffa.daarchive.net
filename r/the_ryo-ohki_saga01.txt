                                 Part 1
   I stretched, then jumped as I saw a bright bolt of light. All of the
sudden, there was this loud rumbling sound, then water drops started falling
from the sky. I huddled in the corner of my prison- a cardboard box. While
chasing a bug on the top of a roof, I accidentaly slipped and fell into this
cage. I mewed and mewed until my throat was hoarse, but no one seemed to
hear
me. I tried biting and digging my way out, but that didn't work either.
Finally giving up, I decided to take my fate the way it comes. I'd probably
be stuck in this box for the rest of my life. That wouldn't be long. I'd
starve to death. Unless carrots grew out of cardboard.
   I shivered. The water drops were falling a lot harder now. my box was
beginning to collect water. I mewed out of frustration. This was my 8th day
stuck in this box and I was really weak from hunger. I mewed again.
   "Hey! Did you hear that?" a young girl's voice said.
   My ears pricked up. I tried meowing again.
   "There it is again, Mehoshi!" the voice said. "I think it's coming from
that cardboard box!"
   I was overjoyed! I kept meowing until the girl's head appeared over the
rim of the box.
   "Oh,  look, Mehoshi!" she gingerly reached in and lifted me out. Holding
me close to her chest, she ran across the street towards a pretty
blond-haired girl. "Isn't she sweet?"
   I mewed.
   Mehoshi smiled. "Sasami, She's adorable!"
   "Do you think we could keep her?" Sasami asked.
   I meowed enthusietically.
   "Sasami," Mehoshi answered, " you're asking the wrong person. I don't
know
if Tenchi would allow it."
   Sasami looked me over. "But look how thin she is! She must be starving!
She's half dead!"
   Mehoshi sighed. "you're right. I guess it wouldn't hurt to take her home
to nurse her back to health. But after she's better, if Tenchi says no, then
back to the streets she goes."
   "Yeay! Tenchi could never say no!" Sasami hugged me.
   And with me huddled warmly in Sasami's arms, we made our way to my new
home.
