				Chapter 5: Worlds Collapsing

	"You mean to tell me thy're copys of each other?" Washu asked at breakfast 
the next morning.
	"That would explain the name thing. God, whoever named them has to be 
insane." Ryoko commented as she helped herself to some more waffles.
	"JUMUNJI!!!! I WIN AGAIN!!!! YES, YES, YES!!!"
	"You can tell she doesn't win that often." Aeka stated.
Maiaka ran past the door shreiking, followed by Miyu, and finally Miya. Mai was 
asleep in the other room on the couch. Ami, Maiaka, and Miyu had on matching 
shirts. Ami's and Maiaka's had the word "Angel" written on them. Miyu's had the 
word "Devil" and a matching tail and headband with devil horns.
	"You to are so immature!" laughed Miya when she got to the door. She 
walked out to join them where they where rolling around on the ground pillow 
fighting.
	"Hey! Ow..That hurt!" Maiaka complained.
	"Stop pulling my hair!" Miyu said as she smacked Maiaka with the pillow.
	"Okay, okay you win! You win!" Maiaka 
	"They'll never learn." Miya shook her head as she laughed.
	"I will have to make them my guinea pigs," Washu added, getting up. She 
walked over to the door. "Oh Miyu, Miya, Maiaka! Come here a minute.
	"Yes?" Maiaka asked as she pulled feathers out of her hair. 
	"What?" Miyu asked when she joined them.
	"You call?" Miya pushed her hair behind her shoulders.
	"Do you have any plans tommorrow?"Washu asked slyly.
	"PILLOW FIGHT!!!" Maiaka and Miyu screamed, then fell over laughing. Miya 
shook her head.
	"Please excuse my sisters for being so immature." Miya bowed, then stood 
up straight again. "But no, we aren't doing anything tommorrow."
	"How long do you plan to stay here, anyway?" Ryoko asked sternly.
	"A week." Miya answered.
	"Forever." Miyu replied joyfully.
Ami had now joined them.
	"A year." she said in her quiet voice and went to get a late breakfast.
Maiaka still haden't answered the question. "As long as needed." she said after 
she thought about it.  
	"You're being rude!" Miya snapped at Ami and Miyu. She seemed to agree 
with Maiaka. "You weren't even invited! You can't invite yourselves!"
	"She'll make a hell of a Queen." Ryoko whispered to Aeka. Aeka just shook 
her head.
	"Once again, please excuse my sisters for being rude."
	"Oh no, we want you to stay with us." Tenchi corrected.
	"Oh look, Miya's wrong for once. What are we going to do?" Miyu mocked.
	"Shut up Miyu."
	"We can stay?" Ami asked excitedly. Miya bent down and wiped the jelly off 
her mouth.
	"Sure, If you want." responded Tenchi happily.
	"Miya, Mai woke up." Ami reported.
	"It's about time." Miya said huffily.
	"She's always like this when shes wrong." whispered Miyu. She got an evil 
look. "Hey, wanna do something fun?"
	"Uhh..."Tenchi didn't know what to say. 
	"Good. C'mon. MAIAKA!" She screeched.
	"Yes Miyu?"
	"C'mon, we're going to do something, like, fun."
	"By the time you get back all four of your bedrooms will be done." Washu 
figured.

				Later...

	"Are we there yet?" Maiaka asked for about the 5,000th time.
	"Almost..." Miyu said, gettinga devilish look that matched her outfit.
	"Oh god, please don't tell me we're going where I think we're going..." 
Maiaka complianed.
	"You really should be a fortune teller, Maiaka."
	"Oh no...not again...please Miyu...I'll do anything but that!"
	"Huh?" Tenchi asked, confused.
They were sitting in a red convertible that Miyu made appear out of nowhere. She 
had the hood down, so since she was doing way past the speed limit, San-ohki 
seemed to be motion sick. Suddenly, something jumped from under one of the seats 
onto Tenchi's lap. Whatever it was, it was hissing at him.
	"Oh good greif, Miyu. You didn't bring that thing with you!" Maiaka 
complained.
	"Of course I brought my baby! How could I leave Tomoyo behind? She's such 
a sweet kitty," Miyu cooed. Tomoyo was a small black cat with mysteriuosly 
bueatiful green eyes. Her fur was soft and shiny, which made her look extremly 
scary and odd.
	"Oh look, she likes you... How sweet." Miyu said happily.
	"Likes...Likes...Likes me? More like she wants to kill me!" Tenchi 
exclaimed.
	"You got that right." Maiaka agreed grumpily.
	"We're here!" Miyu chirped excitedly.
They were at the mall, the hang out of most teens. After they finished shopping 
(and had about 100 bags,) they left. 
	"That took forever. I'm glad to be back." Maiaka sighed when she had about 
two steps to get back to the Misaki Household.
	"Maiaka, Miyu!" Miya ran towards them. She looked really worried.
	"Go on in, oh and, take my bags with you." Miyu gave Tenchi all her bags 
which nearly made him fall over. When he had managed to get in the house, Miya 
turned to her sisters. 
	"The worlds are collapsing. Mai is gone. She was the first. We need to 
hurry! If we don't, It could cost all of our lives!"
