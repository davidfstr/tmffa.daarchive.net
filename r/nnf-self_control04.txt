it if someone owned me...


		No Need for Self Control

	Tenchi woke up on one of Washu's 
medic beds.  He sat up and looked around.
All six of his fianceés looked at him with
care.  "Woah...what happened?" he said 
questioningly.  "You blacked out when we
all said we were pregnant," replied Aeka.
At this, Tenchi began to waver a little 
bit.  Aeka slapped him.  "Not again, 
Tenchi.  Compose yourself!"
	Tenchi tried to, but found himself
wavering again.  He steeled himself and
was able to stay awake.  "P-pregnant?" he
said.  Tenchi felt like he was going to
throw up.  They nodded.  Tenchi began to
feel faint again.  He shook his head to
get rid of the feeling.  Suddenly, his
throat went dry.  "MMmmff!" Tenchi put
his hand over his mouth and ran for the
bathroom.  The women watched him go.
	"Really now, why is HE so upset?"
said Aeka.
	"Yeah, we're the ones that are
going to have to go through childbirth,"
said Ryoko.
	Tenchi walked out of the bathroom
about ten minutes later, wiping his mouth.
He tried not to think of what awaited 
him.  Tenchi stumbled away from the
bathroom door.  Ryoko appeared in front
of him.  "You don't have to be afraid.
Tenchi.  Daddy," she said.
	Tenchi's mouth bulged and he put
his hand over it again.  Tenchi ran
back into the bathroom, and was violently
ill for another forty-five minutes, 
because he kept thinking about what 
Ryoko had said, and what awaited him.
Not one, nor two, but SIX children!
	"Aai, why so early on?  Six
children?" he said, after his last...
session.  Washu happened to be walking
by as he said this.
	"Actually, it's more like ten."
	"T-TEN??!!!" he screamed.
	"Yes, you see, Kiyone and I are
having twins."
	Tenchi's eyelids fluttered, and
again, he ran back into the bathroom, 
and was violently ill for another ninety
minutes.  Then, when he heard Washu
outside the door saying, "I don't get
it.  You say Mihoshi's having twins,
too?" he was ill for yet another hundred
minutes.  
	When Tenchi finally got out of
the bathroom, he looked gaunt.  "Ohhh.."
he moaned.  The girls ran up to greet
him.  "Now wait, don't say anything
about...you know...or I'll be back in
there for a while, yet," he said.
	The girls settled down.  Tenchi
staggered to the kitchen to get something
to drink.  Sasami was there, and she got
him a glass of ice water.  He sat down
and drank it, trying not to think about
all those kids...
	"I never thought I'd be pregnant
at my age," said Sasami.
	Quickly, Tenchi slammed down the
rest of his glass of water, trying to
keep himself from being nauseous.  It
wasn't working.
	He ran for the bathroom, and
was quietly sick again for another
ten minutes, because he'd only just 
gotten something else in his stomach 
that could be tossed back up again.
The girls explained to Sasami that she
shouldn't say anything, at least until
Tenchi coped with it. 
	So again, Tenchi came out of
the bathroom, still unsteady, and
again, sat at the table to try and
get something into his stomach.  Tenchi
retrieved another glass of ice water, 
and let the cool, refreshing beverage
soothe his inflamed throat.  All that
stomach acid doesn't do much good for
one's esophagus.  
	After his stomach had stopped
spazzing, he lay back on his chair to
then let the dizziness settle down.
Kiyone approached slowly, not wanting
to upset him again.  "Uh, Tenchi?"
she said.  "Y-yeah?" said Tenchi, 
hoarsely.  "Why don't you go take a
nice soak in the bath?  That ought
to help you, a little."
	"O-okay."
	So Tenchi went into the bath
to try and calm his tattered nerves.
"Aaahhh..." said Tenchi, letting his
body sink into the hot water.  It
did wonders for him, as his tightened
muscles loosened up.  It was so
soothing, he almost fell asleep.  
Tenchi breathed in the vapors coming
off the water's surface, and felt 
his throat start to calm down.
	After a good, long soak, Tenchi
got out of the bath.  He noticed that
the women hadn't come in, which was a 
sign that they wanted him to calm down.
He also guessed that they wouldn't
mention...  He didn't want to think 
about it.  Unfortunately for him, his
dad had just gotten wind of it, from
Mihoshi.
	"Tenchi!!  Twelve kids!  That's 
absolutely amazing!!  I knew you had it
in you, son!  So THAT'S what those 
noises were a couple of nights ago! 
You dog, you!" his father raved.
	Tenchi reined in his stomach
with all his might, and this time, it
held.  Until his father gave him a 
hearty slap on the back, at which 
point he ran for the bathroom....again.
	Tenchi was sick for another 
fifteen minutes.  Mihoshi stood outside
the door.  "Is it healthy to barf that
much?" she questioned.  Kiyone 
answered, "I don't know.  Maybe it's 
something to do with his Jurai powers?"
Mihoshi shrugged, and they left the
door to go back to the kitchen.
	After this last debacle, Tenchi
was finally able to get something into
his shaky stomach.  Of course, Lord
Katsuhito had decided that Tenchi was
healthy enough for sword practice.
	"So, twelve of them, eh?"
said Katsuhito.
	"Jiichan, that's not fair. 
You're already much better than me at
swordplay.  Do you have to cheat and 
use that against me?"
	"All is fair in love and war,
Tenchi." he said calmly, striking
for Tenchi's stomach.  Tenchi leapt,
not quite so deftly, backwards and 
into a tree.
	"Oww..." he said, rubbing 
the back of his head.
	Katsuhito helped him back up
again, and waited for Tenchi to regain
his composure.  "You're lucky I'm an
honorable man, Tenchi, or you'd be
puking again, just not in the 
bathroom."
	"You mean you were thinking
about kicking me in the stomach?"
he questioned.
	"No, I was just thinking of
mentioning all those bouncing babies,
and how you'll have to feed them, 
keep them clothed, take care of them,
and protect them."
	Tenchi's stomach boiled, and
his grandfather got a faceful.  
Katsuhito, after Tenchi was done, 
calmly raised two hands, one to each
of his eyes, and wiped away the bile
with a deft stroke.  "That didn't 
turn out exactly as planned," he
confessed.  
	Tenchi would have laughed,
except he was feeling like doubling
over again and (insert your favorite 
vomit word here).  "You know, this 
is unusual.  Not that you've got 
twelve kids coming at your age, but
the fact that you just can't seem 
to get over it and stop puking
everywhere.  Why, an enemy could
come by right now and kill you with
your blessing."
	After another undeterminable
length of time, Tenchi was done again,
and they went into the house.  "I 
guess you're not going to be able to
continue practice today, eh, Tenchi?"
said Katsuhito, as he left.
	Tenchi's vision blurred as
he looked at the six women of his life.
They all looked at him expectantly,
and he said, "Washu, can you tell what
gender they're going to be, yet?"
	"Actually, I already have,
Tenchi!"
	"Y-yeah?"
	"Eleven girls and one boy!"
Tenchi fainted.
	About an hour later, it was
night time, and he woke up.  Tenchi
looked around to see that he was
on his bed with Aeka, Ryoko, Washu,
Sasami, Kiyone, and Mihoshi.  So
he yawned and went to sleep.  
	When he awoke the next 
morning, he was feeling a whole lot
better than he had before.  And he
felt like he could swallow a horse.
So Tenchi went downstairs and ate
a hearty breakfast, courtesy of
Sasami and Ryo-ohki (to some degree).
	After Tenchi finished eating,
he tended to the fields.  The carrots
were looking especially healthy this
harvest.  And after that, another
soak in the tub.  And back to practice
again, only this time his grandpa's 
taunts didn't have any effect on his
stomach.
	Tenchi stopped after practice
to contemplate the situation.  He'd
proposed only a few days ago, and
all of a sudden, he was going to be
a father, twelve times over.  
	"I only hope we can support
them," was his main line of thinking.
	But there was another thing
on his mind.  "Washu-chan," he said
to the brilliant scientist, his 
voice echoing through her lab.  "Yes?"
she replied.  
	"Well, how long is the gestation
period for the women?"
	"Well, for me, Mihoshi, and
Kiyone, the period is the same as the
locals, nine months.  But for Aeka,
Ryoko, and Sasami...about three months."
	Tenchi took that information
a lot better than Washu thought he 
would.  He simply nodded.  "Okay, and
another thing," 
	"Hmm?" 
	"Where are we going to get 
the money to provide for these kids?"
he said.
	"Oh, don't worry, I can 
fabricate all the supplies that are
needed for the kids except for milk.
That, I'm afraid, is either going to
require that you buy some formula, 
or.."
	"Or what?"
	"Or we breastfeed!"
	Tenchi thought back to the
time Taro had been over, and he had
overheard Mihoshi in the bath.  Only
now, it would be for real, times two.
Tenchi's nose bled.
	"Well, I sure hope it's not
a hindrance for such a genius to 
have to do...well...that."
	"No, if there are kids around,
you can be sure I'll take care of them,
especially if they're mine."
	"Well, I already know how
devoted you are to your kids, and 
ironically, I was able to do something
about your child, after all.  Although
I'm sure it'll never be a true 
replacement."
	"No matter what, I'll still 
raise the children with love," she
said.
	Tenchi hugged her.  "I'm sure
you will, Washu-chan."
	Of course, Washu grabbed onto
him and frenched him for all she was
worth.  Tenchi was able to give her
a run for her money.  But in the end,
they came out tied, and both a little
exasperated.
	"Well, I'll be sure to make
more appointments, Washu," he said.
	"My office is always open,"
she said.
	So Tenchi left the lab and
set out to get some food.  And as
always, Sasami had a banquet fixed
up for him.  "So," started Tenchi.
"Washu tells me we only have three
months to wait for Ryoko, Sasami,
and Aeka's babies."
	Aeka, Ryoko, and Sasami 
all kissed Tenchi.  "And only 
another six months after that for
the rest of you." he said.  They came
over and kissed. Tenchi.
	"Ah," he said.  "It's a wonderful
life."
=========================================
Well, I tried to cover a lot of facts there,
including the gestation periods and the 
like.  Oh, and Masaki and NNFSC are both
separate, so the facts in either can be
switched around.
