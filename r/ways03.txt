The Ways of the Goddesses
Part three- Knight's Sacrifice
By F. Van Assche

Disclaimer:
I don’t own Tenchi Muyo- Pioneer and AIC do. I used their
characters. It doesn’t mean I’m a bad person. Don’t sue me.
I’m really a nice guy. Marty’s my character, though. You can
take the fic if you want, just give me credit if you ever
use it. Enjoy!

"The first rule in dealing with the devil: don't."


			Chapter One

The most dangerous thing that exists is a masterless weapon, 
a tempting prize for those who would desire it... A pawn, 
advanced to the eighth rank, can become a knight, and if 
sacrificed carefully, is the difference between victory and 
defeat. If heedlessly forfeited, it can be used against a 
player... In the games of the goddesses, one knight can make 
all the difference....
	
Marty awoke inside a cell. <Where am I?>

He examined his prison. After blasting and hacking at the 
doorway with no results, he spoke.

"Who are you, and what do you want?"

Then someone connected with his mind in a 100 decibel whisper.

"I am your mistress... you are my weapon... I need you..."

<Tokimi... No... I've got to get out of...>

"Foolish little boy... there is no escape.. you are mine..."


<So you can read my thoughts, hm? Then you know I will fight 
you.>

"It matters not... I will forge you to my desires, young one...."
 	
Then the world went black.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

When Marty regained consciousness, he floated through an empty 
void. D3 and Tokimi appeared before him.

"You won't beat me! I won't let you!"

D3 laughed at him.

"Pathetic scum. We already have. You just don't know it yet. I 
will give you a chance to go freely... It will be easier on 
you."

"Yes... the best course is submission, young one..."

"I'd rather die first."

"Such noble sentiment... pity... your race is so easily 
controlled.."

"C-controlled? What do you mean?"

"I think you will soon learn, pawn,"D3 chuckled.
  
And the horrors began....

---------------------------------------------------------------

Somewhere around Earth, the tree that was Tsunami began to weep...

---------------------------------------------------------------

				Chapter Two

Agonies of the flesh, while excruciating, are only transitory.
They leave scars,  but the pain is fleeting. Perhaps the lucky 
ones die. Torture of the mind does not bring death. To teeter 
on the edge of madness, ah... that is hell unbound... 
	
The tortures of the mind are not designed to kill, only to 
break. They wear away the defenses of the mind like a rock in 
a stream, dulling the wits... 
 	
<Water.> Marty thought. <It's like being trapped in a tank of
water... >

The first day all he tried to do was scream. But where there 
is no air, there is no sound. Soon all he could perceive was 
his own thoughts, and these broke away one by one. He began to
forget. Mokona, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka... they all vanished 
within two days. After that, all he could do was drift and 
watch as his soul split apart...

D3 chose to examine his progress soon after.

"Give up, you inept fool, or you shall truly see hell," he 
said.

Marty tried to speak and found he could not.

"I will not deign to communicate with you using speech. Try 
again."

<Go screw yourself... If you were gonna kill me, you woulda 
done it by now...> he thought dazedly.

"Kill you? That was never my lady's intention. You are to 
become her machine. Resisting this will only serve to 
weaken you further."

<Then, I guess I won't be much of a weapon then...>

D3 scowled at him.

"I suppose not. Let us truly see how durable you are, 
young knight."

He then vanished, leaving Marty in the eternal emptiness.
	
After eight more endless days of senseless floating through 
the void, D3 made his presence known once again. Marty was 
slowly losing all his resistance to Tokimi as well as his 
sanity.

"You have not yielded, I see. Truly commendable for such an 
inferior species."

<What inferior species? I still... still don't understand...>

"Oh, so you truly don't know of the legend of the gems on 
your world," D3 smirked.

"Fool. Well, allow me to enlighten you.  Those gems were 
under my lady's control when they left this universe. They 
remember what happened in your realm. That foolish king...
He wore the gems then, as you do now. His feeble mind was 
overwhelmed by their power."

As these words were spoken, the void shifted, becoming the
anteroom of Tokimi's chambers. That held Marty's attention. 
The world existed for him, partially, once more.

"Maddened with power, he led his armies to the ends of his 
known world, pushing back civilization after civilization. 
For who can stop a god? Further and further he went... 
then... then, he sought to stop. He tried to fight the gift
he had been given. Lady Tokimi's might was given him and he
 dared to DENY IT!"

<It was... was not her pow...> D3 swung at Marty. When he 
made contact, the world shimmered and Marty screamed in 
desperation.

"You will not think to me in that fashion again. Attempt it,
and I will crush your mind into dust! Why Tokimi does not 
allow me to now, I do not know...  Your ancestor... he 
fought the power, and it killed him. No fatal wound by an 
enemy, simply his own stupidity... Humph!"

Tokimi's voice suddenly  encompassed the two. 

"D3... leave him..." 

"Yes, my lady," he replied, and disappeared, as Tokimi's 
form appeared above Marty.

"Oh... you of noble lineage.... why do you fight? I give
you this power..." she said as she reached out and gently 
caressed his brow with her fingers. "You need not resist..."

Her touch... the agony subsided. It was like air to a man 
trapped beneath the waves. Marty's universe flash focused; 
it was Tokimi. She was all that existed for him.... whether 
this moment lasted the briefest of seconds or millions of 
eons, the result was the same. His mind had been broken. 
Tokimi had won.

-------------------------------------------------------------
	
Is it truly better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven? 
Or to pose it a different way, is the greatest horror to serve
in hell? To cast away all inhibitions and goodness, and embrace
the darkness? Perhaps. Compared to the madness of solitude, 
it is a preferable substitute. Tokimi's new warrior had cast 
away his old form, but the pain of conversion was costly. He 
emerged from the darkness emaciated and worn.  Tokimi allowed 
him to recover, but then his new training began...
	
As a severe understatement, it was sadistic. To get a comparable
idea, imagine dissecting yourself, sans anesthesia, then 
rebuilding your body to working order. But survive it, he did,
and emerged stronger than before.  Now he began his missions.

He started on small craft, then moved up to larger vessels, 
and finally took down a Juraian battle cruiser. Tokimi and D3 
believed him nearly ready for his most important assignment, 
the task that would tilt the balance of the universe in their
favor...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

As a final test of merit, Tokimi sent her knight to a Juraian
colony with one objective.

Kill them all.

And so he did. With all his training, the guards did not stand 
a chance, and fell, one after the other. He mercilessly 
disemboweled them with his sword as their attacks bounced off 
of him. Death was all around him as he entered the quarters of
the civilians... No woman or child survived that day. The blood 
of the innocent was on the knight; he reveled in it. He entered 
into the tree room of the colony to finish the job.

Inside, he gave pause, and his eyes awoke. The sun of this world 
had just begun to shine on the crystalline leaves of the Juraian
wood. The light reflected through the chamber and onto him. He 
looked around and saw himself; bloodstained and gory. He gazed 
momentarily at the tree, then walked to the guestbook of the 
colony. He ripped away two pages, and wrote. He dropped the 
first as his eyes became dim once again, and summoned his blade 
to complete his task.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Tsunami watched him destroy what she had built. When he entered
the chamber, she allowed him a moment of peace.

<Here is your chance, my Knight. Use it well, and learn.> she 
thought sorrowfully.

---------------------------------------------------------------

When the Galaxy Police arrived at the colony, all they found 
were pieces of flesh that were once people, and the remains of 
what was once a Juraian tree. They also found a letter near the
remains of the tree. The GP officers attempted to use it to gain
an insight into the attack, but the Juraian Defense Force seized
it. Inexplicably, it was allowed to be delivered.

---------------------------------------------------------------

"Well, done.... my young knight"

"I thank you, my lady. What is my next task?"

"You have proven yourself worthy of the task at which all others 
have failed," said D3

"I do not understand, my lady," he said.

"I have a gift... your final power... the third gem."

"Now you will be able to create the Wings of the Light Hawk."

"Thank you. I will not fail you. What is my task?"

"You... my dear little one... lay siege upon the Earth.... your 
mission is the death of the Juraian line..."

--------------------------------------------------------------

The letter reached Mokona five days after the attack.

It read:

My dearest Mokona,

I fear these will be the last words you will ever hear from 
me. The man you knew has ceased to exist. For all purposes, I
am already dead. I am sorry with all my heart to say that I 
will most likely never see you again. I am, perhaps, an 
outcast even if I survive the days to come. Please don't cry.
I just want you to know that I love you with all of my heart.
					
                        -Marty

The tears flowed to fill the Great Sea of Jurai as she wept.

				Chapter Three	

Time passed. Tokimi's champion readied himself for his new
mission. From time to time Tokimi visited him, and they 
discussed the future, or rather, the future of their plans...
	
The knight looked out at the stars from his chambers. 

"I will rule this, my lady?"

"Yes... once the Juraian line has fallen... there will be a 
need for a new emperor..."

"So, I will rule... incredible..." he said as Tokimi 
disappeared.

------------------------------------------------------------

In Tokimi's anteroom, D3 watched as his mistress appeared 
before him. 

"My lady, why do you fill the boy's head with these 
delusions? You know as well as I that he cannot be allowed
to rule here..."

"He is a means to an end, nothing more... after he has 
completed his task, he is yours to destroy..."

"Thank you, my lady."

------------------------------------------------------------

Far in the recesses of the knight's mind, a whisper began to
build... flickers of thoughts... memories... a woman...

The knight brushed away this murmur, as he had long ceased to 
distrust his mistress. He departed for the Earth with his 
lady's blessing. As he plunged through the abyss of space,
he vaguely recalled... a similar situation... He shoved the
thought to the back of his memory.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Then moon had just risen in the night sky above the snow 
covered Masaki shrine. It was no normal sight. The light 
from the moon reflected blood red, bathing the whole of 
the earth in an unholy glow.

The knight landed softly inside a great forest, miles from
his targets. He began to walk, the heavy snowfall masking 
all trace of his presence. By the early hours of the 
morning, he had reached the house. He steeled himself for 
the task at hand, then moved closer..

-----------------------------------------------------------

Sasami dreamed...
	
<Under a bloody sky, two men faced each other... The first 
drew out a Light Hawk Wing and slashed at the second. He 
stood firm, and suddenly, a green blade broke through the 
Light Hawk Wing and cut through the first combatant, 
spraying the wielder with blood. The first fell, and the 
second looked down, eyes aglow, then screamed at the sky...>
 
She was awakened by the opening of her window...

------------------------------------------------------------

The knight grabbed the sill and pulled it slowly up. He 
saw his target, the Crown Princess of Jurai, sleeping 
quietly across the room. He did not notice the younger 
princess in the room until she moved to embrace him.

He looked down coldly at the sobbing girl next to him. He 
stepped away from her and began charging his sword. As she
stared into his dead eyes, Tsunami assailed her thoughts 

<Run, Sasami, run! It's not...> 

Sasami never even turned before the sword passed through 
her, and she dissipated into a cloud of energy. The near 
silent voice inside him built to a roar even as he moved 
to terminate Ayeka, who had awoken during the slaying. 
	
She blasted him with every iota of strength she could 
muster, only succeeding in knocking him through the window,
away from the house, and waking everyone else up. Tenchi 
ran outside, master key in his hand, to face him.

The knight let loose a huge blast of energy in Tenchi's 
direction. Tenchi had no chance of avoiding the discharge,
and took it full force.

He emerged unscathed, protected by the Wings of the Light
Hawk. Tenchi now recognized his adversary. Needless to say,
it shook him somewhat.

"Marty? Wha- what are you doing?!"

The knight's eyes were cold and emotionless, and he spoke 
in a low monotone, 

"If you knew me once, young price, you do not know me now.
I have become the darkness; I have no name. Now, step aside,
or I will kill you."

Tenchi stepped forward. The knight's face quivered in 
surprise.

He spoke again, more forcefully, "You not need die today, 
Juraian... My mission does not concern you... merely the 
princess." He moved to continue towards the house.

"You stay right there. I don't care who you are, you're 
not going back in."

The knight peered at Tenchi rather quizzically. 

"If you truly wish to die today..."

He summoned his blade.

"...I will fulfill your request!" he said, charging.

Tenchi summoned his own Light Hawk Wing, and the distance 
between the two rapidly closed. 

In a moment's time, the two were within striking distance.
They swung...

Their swords clashed and locked together. The energy from 
the blades arced and flashed, burning away the vegetation 
around the fighters as they tried to gain the upper hand. 
Tenchi wrenched his sword away, then attempted to slash 
across his opponent's exposed middle.
	
To his surprise, his opponent was not there...

"Well met. That was the same type of strike you used to 
kill Kagato, correct? Let me inform you of something..." 
he said, as he fired off a two handed strike that knocked 
his former friend to the ground.

"... I'm NOT Kagato."

The knight moved in to finish the kill. He lifted his 
sword...

Tenchi watched with amazement as his former houseguest 
lifted his sword, then stopped.

The tiny voice he had been hearing climaxed in a fearsome 
rage, overcoming all the horrors, all the pain he had 
endured over the last months. It even beat back Tokimi's 
control. Marty began to weep as Tokimi and D3 pumped more 
and more power into him to regain command.

Tenchi stood as a whisper echoed over the snowy field.

"Finish it, Tenchi... Hurry, or you're all dead..."

Tenchi summoned his Light Hawk Wing and fulfilled the 
request.

As blood began to pour from his wound, Marty spoke.

"Thank you..."

He fell to his knees, then slumped over.
	

A torn note fluttered to the ground by Tenchi's feet. He 
picked it up and read.

--------------------------------------------------------

To my friends, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, and Mihoshi,

I suppose if you've managed to get this letter, you've 
managed to stop me from whatever I was forced to attempt. 
I'm sorry. Tokimi corrupted me.  God knows what I've done 
already, or what I might have done had you not stopped me.
I don't know why this had to happen, but finish what you 
have begun. Make sure Tokimi has no chance to attempt this
again; next time, she will not fail.
			    
                         -Marty


Tenchi crushed the paper in his hand and sprinted towards 
the house.

-------------------------------------------------------

As Tenchi left the scene, Washu emerged from the bushes 
with Tsunami's energy form.

"Damn it, Tsunami, I hope you know what you're doing here...
 if this plan doesn't work, we're both dead. My powers are
locked in the gems... and you... you won't survive too 
long unless we can find a way to bring back Sasami..."

"I know, I know. I should have gotten her out of harm's way,
 then this situation wouldn't be so critical!! I hope those
 three can defeat D3 and Aemon, otherwise..."

"Let's not think about otherwise. We'll do what we can 
here," Washu said, gesturing towards the fallen form in 
the snow.

 The two goddesses hefted the broken body and walked 
toward Funaho.

Author's notes

This one was tough to write... after all, how much could 
any one person take before betraying his friends? Would it
take torture? appeal to greed? We all have weaknesses, and
 trying to access the weaknesses of the character as he is
written. The flip side of this question is the motives to 
return to the state of character before the change. How, 
or even, why, did he escape the bonds of Tokimi's servitude?
Muse on that, if you care to.
	
On a lighter note, if you didn't like the character of 
Marty, he's dead now, and you won't see him for a while. 
That's it, I think. C&C, MST, and Flames go to

Thanks for reading.
