"What ails you, my son?"

Darkness, a gentle voice, what happened?

"Washu, please!"

Who's that?

"Everybody, I'm trying my hardest!"

That has to be Washu, I'm sure of it.

"My son, I have missed you so."

Who am I?

"Washu, Washu, Washu, Washu!"

"Quiet Ryoko! I need to concentrate!"

Ryoko, I know Ryoko. She's my friend.

"Oh, God, Tenchi, no!"

That's Ryoko. Why is she so...worried...?

Now I know who I am. I'm Tenchi Masaki. I...I just saved my friends from 
oblivion, but what am I doing in this darkness? I cannot...I want to see my 
friends.

"Tenchi..."

My mother?

"Washu, will he be okay?"

"I was sure he was done for, but he still has some life left in him."

"I even warned him, but he wouldn't listen..."

"Ayeka, you've said that a million times already. He acted of his own free will. 
If he had listened to us, we wouldn't be here."

Oh yes. Ryoko and I saved everybody by stopping the asteroid. I made Light Hawk 
Wings, and Ryoko helped me make them bigger. Yes, we stopped it and everyone is 
safe. That was hard to do.

"Ryoko, get me that suction tube."

"Here. And hurry! Look at the pulse monitor!"

Ryoko. She's always so pushy. But, I wouldn't have her any other way.

"Ryoko, everyone, please! I'm trying my hardest, I can't hurry! You want me to 
make a mistake and kill him?"

Oooh. So tired. I feel like I've accomplished something. That's good.

"Oh no, no!"

"Washu, what's wrong?"

"Help! Help me, get the electric rods!"

Ouch. That hurt. What was that?

"My son, be strong."

That voice again! It sounds familiar...

"Good."

"What's good, Washu?"

That's Ayeka. She's the Princess of Jurai and sister to Sasami. She and Ryoko 
are so strange.

"Well, if it had gone any lower, I would have to tell you that he's died."

"::gasp::"

I'm so tired, but...someone's telling me to be strong.

"That's right, Tenchi. Strong."

See?

"Hmmm. Oh no! His energy! It's somehow draining away!"

"Washu, what are you talking about?"

"I put a device that would keep his energy from draining away, but it's not 
working! I've tested it on everything!"

"Could it be that Tenchi is giving up?"

No! I'm not giving up. I never have.

"Good, Tenchi. I'm proud."

Now I know who that is!"

"Washu!"

It's-

"Everyone, hope for the best!"

-my mother!

"Come on Washu! I know you can do it!"

There's Sasami. I'm tired. I...can't stay awake any longer...but I 
tried...Mother...

"The rods! The rods!"

Ouch!

"Tenchi, you tried. There is no dishonor. Take your rest."

Thank...you, Mother. I'm very tired.

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

I will sleep now.

"Washu! What are you yelling about!?"

"::sob:: Tenchi's gone. ::sob::"

"NOOOOOOO! Washu! How-how could you?"

"I'm sorry...everybody."

I've already put a disclaimer in the last one, need I put another?

Okay, fine! You want to sue me? I'll put a disclaimer then!

You don't have to be so hard on me...
