Lost souls: act 8: a new student and a new trouble  

Hi all! You're back! Thank you so much! Well, on with it then, to the 
story!


Ameka awoke with a start, shook her head and fell back asleep, in the 
morning she wouldn't remember.

(Sunday)
 
"Washu!" Tenchi yelled for Washu
"Yes Tenchi?" she appeared in front of him
"I need you to file this for me, it's a list of all the students"
"But didn't I just do one of these?"
"Yes but I have a new kid from the U.S. in the class now"
"Ill do it for one thing" Tenchi sighed
"Please, little Washu" 
"That's better. It'll be done tonight"
"Thank you miss Washu"    


Tenchi, Mayki and the girls where eating when Washu ran in
"Tenchi. need. to. talk. now" she was out of breath 
"Ok miss Washu, what is it?" Tenchi sound worried about her
<Please don't say you've got cancer again>
"Its about Ryoko-Chan" everyone but Mayki gasped
"Mayki, go, now" Tenchi didn't know what Washu knew but he had a hunch 
it was bad 
"But-" Mayki was cut off by Tenchi
"Now"
"Whatever" Mayki mummerd as he walked out

"Now, what is it Washu?" Tenchi asked
"Shes alive, she had the baby"
"How-" 
"Shes in your class"
"WHAT?" everyone yelled as a computer popped in front of Washu
"Ameka Habuki/Masaki, age 16, height 5 ft. 15' in. Gold eyes, black 
hair. Mother, Ryoko Habuki, age by looks 34, age 1003, height 6 ft. 12' 
in. Gold eyes, blue hair. Father, Tenchi Masaki, age 33, height 6 ft. 
10' in. brown eyes, black hair." Washu read off the computer "Its her 
alright, the thing is now that you have to kill her Tenchi or we all 
die" Tenchi looked into his glass 
"I know, but can I at lest give her the school year?" 
"I guess no harm can come from the rest of he school year" Washu said 
as she walked away
^If the babies alive.^ Tenchi thought 
<Then so is Ryoko>

Tenchi couldn't help looking at Ameka every now and then at school 

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

(Monday)

"Ok class, clam down, we have new kid in class, Temp oiko" Tenchi 
pointed to the boy next to Ameka  
"Hi, I'm Ameka" Ameka said
"I'm Temp, nice to met you" as Temp said this he hurt
<Why did it have to be her and him? >


(Friday)

^I still can't believe that she's my darter.^
<You think your shocked> Tenchi thought as he helped Sasami set the 
table 
"Tenchi!" Washu called him from her lab
"Go Tenchi, ill make the table" Sasami told him, he nodded and walked 
down to the lab
"Tenchi, I have some bad news," Washu said
"What is it?" Tenchi asked
"This" she pulled up a computer with a picture of Ameka and Mayki 
kissing "I've been watching them all night" Tenchi was a anime stone 
guy again
"B-bu-but."
"I know, they're brother and sister, but they don't know that. When he 
gets home I must have a promise from you to ban him from her, I fear if 
it gets to out of hand we'll have not only one nova to kill but two"
"Your right, I promise"
 
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& 


"WHAT?????????????? WHY NOT???????????" Mayki yelled
"Because I said! Now go" Tenchi turned on his heel and left

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(Saturday)

Ameka (drunk 'cause Mayki left her) petted Sella as Sella stared at her 
and, with a short "mew", turned her into  lady Ameka, who was asleep. 
Lady Ameka stood (in her dream) in a small circle of mirrors, mirrors 
in-clouded in dark that showed nothing but the dark
"Heeheehee" a voice echoed in the dark
"Who's there?" Ameka tried to sound strong but couldn't. One mirror 
showed her refection, but only to a point, and it soon got clearer ill 
it showed, not her, but a twin to her, a twin in a black dress and high 
heels 
"Heeheehee, do you really think you could find a new body without me 
tagging along?" it was her, the demon
"I knew you'd come, Ameko"


well, that's all for act 8, stay tuned for act 9:a trip to Tenchi's and 
a rescue for Ryoko!
