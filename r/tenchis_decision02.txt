                           Tenchi’s Decision Part 2

                                   by Dorothy McCoubrey



        After everyone in the hose had gone to bed Ryoko tried to sleep, but
couldn’t stop thinking about Tenchi. “I know!!! I’ll go talk to him in his
room!” She said to herself. She quietly got out of bed and tiptoed to
Tenchi’s bedroom trying not to wake anyone. As Ryoko opened the door she
looked to see if Tenchi was asleep, but he was still awake.

             “Come in,” Tenchi said. Ryoko decided to enter. “Hello Ryoko,”
he said cheerfully. “I couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d see if you were
still awake,” she said smiling. “Why don’t we go for a little walk,” she
suggested. Tenchi smiled, “Okay sure,” he said getting out of bed.



            “Wow! Look at the stars!” Ryoko said as they walked through the
woods. “Yeah, isn’t it nice,” Tenchi said. “It sure is,” she said. “You know
I was thinking we should do something together tomorrow,” Ryoko said. “I
guess,” Tenchi said hesitantly. "Great we'll go first thing tomarrow
morning," she said as they headed back to the shrine.

      What have I gotten myself into know?!" Tenchi said hanging his head
and getting sweatbeads.
