Act 1 Scene 8

(this scene takes place at the end of the day. Bijoshi is asleep in Ryoko's 
old
bedroom and everyone else except Tenchi and Ryoko are in bed. Tenchi and 
Ryoko
are downstairs, laid together on the couch, watching T.V.)

Tenchi - (sighs) What an eventful day. I can't believe that our daughter is
asleep in your old room.
Ryoko - (smiles) Yes I know, it's a bit spooky. I can't believe that all of 
that
stuff happens in the future aswell.
Tenchi - And that my grandfather is Yosho and that I am directly in line to 
the
throne. I am an eighth Juraian then, aren't I?
Ryoko - Yes, you are Tenchi. That is why you are so strong and powerful
(whispers into his ear) And that's what I like about you Tenchi.
Tenchi - (smiles) Are you sure that's all you like about me Ryoko?
Ryoko - Well, I can think of many things (teleports Tenchi into their 
bedroom)
And...I may be able to think of a few more soon.
Tenchi - (blushes) Well Ryoko, you know that this will be my first time.
Ryoko - (smiles) Well, it will be mine too Tenchi. So...we'll share the
experience together.
Tenchi - (smiles)

(fades out)
