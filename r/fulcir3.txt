			     INTERLUDE

Establishing Shot: Blackness.  In the background a pair of soft
drums can be heard. The blackness zooms out and we see the
iris of the eye, it holds a distinct magenta hue.  The camera
continues to zoom out until we see the younger face of AEKA.
She is crying on the shoulder of her older half-brother YOUSHO,
who is petting her purplish hair.

				AEKA
		Why do they have to be so mean?

				YOUSHO
		<soft> They fear of what is to become
		of the Empire if it becomes impure.  The
		public doesn’t think very well of humans,
		they were very upset when they found out
		my mother was one.

				AEKA
		But why does it have to be this way?
		What do we have to fear from humans?

				YOUSHO
		We have a lot to fear, or the consul does.
		Azusa is a powerful Emperor, but it is
		likely that I will be more powerful.  The
		Imperial Science Academy discovered
		a while back that human blood, mixed
		with that of a Juraian, was stronger than
		that of a purebred Juraian.

				AEKA
		But isn't that good?

				YOUSHO
		It is in many ways, and in many ways
		it is not.  The people are very biased,
		they were in outrage when Azusa told
		them that Funaho was human, and that
		their only crown heir was of mixed blood.

YOUSHO puts his hands on AEKA's shoulders, she looks up
into his eyes, he is staring far off into the distance.

				YOUSHO
		But they are wrong. <beat> A strong
		Emperor can only make the Empire
		stronger, but that is out of sight for them.
		They only see my mother, they look
		at me and see only a human, not a
		Prince or a Juraian, but a human.

				AEKA
		<determined>I know what we can do. 

YOUSHO looks down at AEKA.

				AEKA
		You can marry me.  That way they'd
		have to make you Emperor.

YOUSHO smiles a bit at his half-sisters offer.

				YOUSHO
		Azusa would find a way around that,
		he fears what the public would do if
		he didn't do what they thought was
		right.  <frowns>  And what would
		you be?  Just one of the Imperial
		Wives?  Wouldn't you like to rule
		someday?

AEKA is silent.  YOUSHO digs in his pocket and pulls out the
Tenchi-Ken, it has no gems in it.  He holds it in his hand and
looks to the sky with hate.

				YOUSHO
		I don't know what I can do anymore.
		Either I'll be forced to be Emperor
		for a public that hates me, or I'll be
		forced to leave by a father who loves
		me.  <grits his teeth> There must be
		some other choice.

The sight of YOUSHO is drowned out by flames that soon
part to show a much older AEKA (the one we know) running
through ruins.
				AEKA
		<yelling> YOUSHO! YOUSHO!!
		Ooh, my love where are you?!!

A large, flaming beam falls in front of AEKA, the flames flare
up and when they die down we see YOUSHO with the
Tenchi-Ken fighting a green eyed RYOUKO.  They fight
with the fury and skill of the greatest swordsmen.  In the end,
YOUSHO stabs RYOUKO in the neck and extracts a small
third gem that lands in his hand.  RYOUKO suddenly kicks the
sword away and flies away in RYO-OHKI.

Cut to AEKA trying to navigate through the broken and flaming
wreckage.  She suddenly looks up to see RYO-OHKI flying into
space with YOUSHO following close behind.

				AEKA
		YOUSHO!! Don't leave me! Yousho 
… how could you …

AEKA pulls through the wreckage, tearing a few of her robes,
and dashes over to where the ships just took off from.  A single
tear falls from her eye and lands on the Tenchi-Ken, which is
lying on the ground in front of her.  It has two gems in it. AEKA
looks down and sees the Tenchi-Ken.

				AEKA
		Your sword … <looks to space> your,
		not coming back, are you?

AEKA clutches the sword tight against herself.

				AEKA
		<cries> YOUSHOOOO!!!!

Camera pans outward into space, we see the planet Jurai
Silently spinning, RYO-OHKI flies past the camera, covering
it in darkness.

		Episode 3: What Dreams Are Made Of

Establishing Shot: Daylight, the sun beating down on the Masaki
household.  RYOUKO is lying on the 'Newly Repaired' roof enjoying
the sun.

				RYOUKO
		Ahhh, <sigh> this is the life.  The warm
		sun, a cool breeze …

RYOUKO stiffens and sits up.  A "Myaaa" is heard in the distance.

				RYOUKO
		A child to start the day.

RYOUKO jumps off the roof, slowly floating down, then starts
casually walking towards the lake.  AEKA is looking out the
window, sees RYOUKO, then quickly shuts the blinds.  SASAMI
slides open the door and walks in.  AEKA is gripping the Tenchi-ken
tightly against her chest.

				SASAMI
		Aeka, you have to come out.  It’s a beautiful
		day.

				AEKA
		I … I don't want to.

				SASAMI
		You can't stay here.  For the last
three days all you've done is stay 
in here, Tenchi is going to get a 
bad impression about us Juraians
if we don't ever leave one room.

				AEKA
		Tenchi … Well, I suppose I could 
come down for a while.

Cut to RYOUKO walking on top of the lake as if it was solid
ground.
				RYOUKO
		Well, lets see.  This looks like
the spot.

RYOUKO sinks down into the water.  Beneath the tides we
see the wreckage from the two ships lying in twisted formations.
RYOUKO paws through the wreck until she comes across
a small purple egg, which she picks up and nuzzles against
her cheek.  She rises back up to the surface and carries the
egg into the house.

ADAM yawns and walks out of his room, his hair is sticking
up all over the place almost looking like RYOUKO.  He walks
into the kitchen and finds MIHOSHI standing by the stove with
an apron on.

				ADAM
		Good Morning Mihoshi. <perk>
		What 'cha cooking?

				MIHOSHI
		Oh, hello Adam.  I’m cooking
		up a nice breakfast for everyone!

				ADAM
		Oh, that’s nice. <frowns> Wait
		a minute … what ARE you
		cooking?

MIHOSHI looks around at the mess of cooking ingredients
she has gathered.

				MIHOSHI
		<worried> Umm, well, I don't
		know.  <looks up> Well, I saw
		this recipe once on a show and
		I figured I could do it, but I don't
		quite remember what was in it
		so…

				ADAM
		Sooo, you're just putting things
		in a pot and hoping they come
		out like you saw on TV, right?

				MIHOSHI
		<thinking>Ummm … Uhhh … 
oohhh.. Yup, that’s it exactly!

ADAM quickly looks into the bubbling pot and takes a smell,
which he instantly regrets as the fumes can only be described
as harmful.

				ADAM
		What on Earth did you put in
		this?

				MIHOSHI
		Oh, you know, a bit of this, a
		dash of that.  Just like they
		say in the show!

ADAM places a hand to his forehead and sighs.

				ADAM
		Okay, lets see if we can save
		this before Tenchi wakes up.
		<rolls up sleeve> Hand me
		that spoon.

AEKA and SASAMI walk down a staircase into the living
room of the Masaki house.  SASAMI gets to the floor and 
immediately looks around.

				SASAMI
		Where is everyone?

RYOUKO raises her head up from the sofa facing away from 
the staircase. AEKA turns her head away from RYOUKO after
seeing her.

				RYOUKO
		I dunno, Tenchi's dad left to
		do work, and I don't know
		where Tenchi is.

				SASAMI
		<sad> ooh, after I went though
		all that to get Aeka to come
		down.

SASAMI looks down at RYOUKO and sees the egg she had
from before.

				SASAMI
		What's that Ryouko?

				AEKA
		No! Sasami, don't touch that
		thing.

				RYOUKO
		Isn't it wonderful, it was just
		born today.

				SASAMI
		Wow! Did you lay that egg
		Ryouko?

				RYOUKO
		Yup

				SASAMI
		Wow! So, you married Ryoko?
		Who's the father?

A door slides open and Tenchi is standing in the
doorway.

				TENCHI
		<yawns> Oh, Aeka.  Good
		Morning.

				AEKA
		Tenchi, <faint> I just wanted
		to say … to thank you … for
		letting us stay, I … I thank
		you for caring for … uh … the
		Imperial family. So … Umm..
		Thankyouverymuch.

				TENCHI
		Ohh, you didn't have to thank
		me, it’s the least I could do.

SASAMI gasps a big breath of air, that catches AEKA's
attention.

				SASAMI
		Huh?! Tenchi is the father?!?

AEKA looks startled then looks on Tenchi with scorn.

				TENCHI
		Huh? Aeka, you look mad, is
		Something wrong?

				AEKA
		Oooh! Nothing! You just go and
		have fun with your Monster
		woman!

				TENCHI
		Wha ---

RYOUKO appears next to TENCHI with her arms Draped
around him.

				RYOUKO
		Oh, Tenchi!  I'm so happy to
		have given birth to the child
		of the man I love.

				TENCHI
		Huh!?!

TENCHI gets this far off look that’s cross between sheer
terror and confusion.  RYOUKO puts the egg in TENCHI's
hands.

				RYOUKO
		Here Tenchi! Why don't you
		hold it, it won't be long now.

The egg begins to shake in TENCHI's hands.  It rattles back
And forth before spontaneously cracking open and reveling
the hind leg of a furry animal (RYO-OHKI).   TENCHI drops
the egg in fear and the rest of the egg splits open to show
all of RYO-OHKI.

				RYO-OHKI
		<weak> Myaaa!

				SASAMI
		<deep breath> Wow! Ha ha!

RYOUKO picks up RYO-OHKI and holds it against her face.

				RYOUKO
		There, there, that’s a good little
		Ryo-Ohki.

				TENCHI
		Ryo-Ohki, your space ship? Does
		that mean …

				RYOUKO
		A hahahah, of course, this is the
		child of my spaceship.

				SASAMI
		Can a spaceship have a child?

				RYOUKO
		My spaceship was completely
		destroyed, so it reproduced itself.

				TENCHI
		Oh that’s a relief, isn't it Aeka?

				AEKA
		Oooh, I … I mean … I …

AEKA runs out of the living room into a hallway.  There
she runs into YOUSHO who is on his way into the house.

				YOUSHO
		Woah. What's all the hurry?

				AEKA
		I'm … I'm sorry.

YOUSHO looks into AEKA's eyes, she looks back at him,
she suddenly gasps.

				YOUSHO
		Is there something wrong?

				AEKA
		I … no, I'm sorry.

AEKA runs off out the door.  YOUSHO looks back at her
with a strange look in his eye.

A plume of smoke bursts out of the kitchen and into the 
Living room, followed by many coughs.  RYO-OHKI
jumps out of RYOUKO's hands and onto SASAMI's
head.

				ADAM (O.S.)
		<chronic cough> That’s what
		happens when you dump a jar
		of pepper into an open flame.
		Now lets learn from this.

Two figures come through the smoke out of the kitchen.
TENCHI runs over to them.

				TENCHI
		What happened?

				ADAM
		Oh, not much, just having a
		little cooking lesson with
		Mihoshi.  I think its safe to
		say that I've learned not to
		let Mihoshi cook anything.
		<coughs> You better let the
		fumes clear before going in
		there.

				SASAMI
		Are you alright?

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaa?

				ADAM
		Whats that little thing?
		<pets RYO-OHKI> It’s a
		cute little thing.

				SASAMI
		Its name is Ryo-Ohki.

				ADAM
		Ryo-Ohki, like the spaceship
		right?

				SASAMI
		Uh-huh.

				ADAM
		Fascinating.

				MIHOSHI
		Wow, you must really like the
		name Ryo-ohki, Ryouko.

				RYOUKO
		You idiot, that IS Ryo-ohki. Its
		the child of my spaceship.

				MIHOSHI
		Oh.

				RYOUKO
		Come on, Tenchi. I'm bored, lets
		go play! Come on, come on, come
		on!

RYOUKO backs up into YOUSHO coming in through the
doorway. YOUSHO wraps his arms around RYOUKO and
grabs her breasts.

				YOUSHO
		My my, the second time today a
		beautiful girl has run into me. I
		guess I'm just lucky.

				TENCHI
		Grandpa! I'm shocked!

				RYOUKO
		Grrrr, how dare you!

RYOUKO swings around to punch YOUSHO, he blocks her
punch easily with his fist.

				YOUSHO
		My, my, such spirit.

RYOUKO looks at YOUSHO, then at her fist, then at YOUSHO
again.  YOUSHO walks over to SASAMI.

				YOUSHO
		So, this is your child Tenchi?

				SASAMI
		No grandpa, this is Ryo-ohki
		the child of Ryouko's ship.

				YOUSHO
		Uh-huh, that’s nice.  <turns>
		Tenchi, now that you have a
		child …

				TENCHI
		Grandpa! That isn't my child!

				YOUSHO
		I think its time you have some
		responsibility. You have to be
		a good role model for your
		child, Tenchi.

				TENCHI
		<louder> That’s not my child!
		<normal> You all are crazy!

TENCHI storms out of the room down the hallway towards
the door.

				YOUSHO
		Don't forget about your
training! <pause> Don't
mind him, he's the serious
type, like his mother.

RYO-OHKI jumps off SASAMI's head towards the glass sliding
door that looks out onto the lake.

				SASAMI
		What is it?

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaa.  Myaaaa!

RYO-OHKI jumps towards the door until she hits it head on and
bounces back.  SASAMI moves next to RYO-OHKI

				SASAMI
		Whats wrong? <looks up>
		Oh, Aeka …

RYO-OHKI moves through the glass door and jumps off towards
AEKA.

				SASAMI
		Hey, where you- <hits head
		against door> owwww. That
		hurt.  Ryo-ohki!

An explosion off screen turns everyones attention to the staircase
that RYOUKO has just punched into pieces with her fist.  She is
staring at her fist and the wreckage with confusion.

				RYOUKO
		<blinks> What?

				ADAM
		Come on, Mihoshi.  Lets see
		if you can handle cleaning up.

				MIHOSHI
		Oh, I can do that.

				ADAM
		That's what you said about
		cooking.

AEKA is looking out into the lake, some of the wreckage of her
ship is still visible.  She is obviously crying.

				AEKA
		Ohh, I wish I could go home,
		go home to Jurai.  <looks
		down> But my ship is destroyed
		so I don't have a way to get home
		or communicate with Jurai.

AEKA starts crying again.  RYO-OHKI jumps up beside her and
nuzzles herself against AEKA's leg.

				AEKA
		Wha-- <startled> What are
		you doing?  Shoo shoo! Go
		away.

RYO-OHKI gets closer to AEKA.

				AEKA
		Go away. <pauses> Alright
		you just stay here and I'll
		move away.  <pause> Now
		don't you think about following
		me!

AEKA walks off screen, RYO-OHKI follows her.  We see a
Bunch of scenes showing AEKA walking and RYO-OHKI
close behind.  The last scene is AEKA walking up the stairs
that go to the Shrine.  She turns around and looks back at 
RYO-OHKI.

				AEKA
		I told you not to follow me!

RYO-OHKI runs off the stairs into the nearby brush.  AEKA
moves closer to RYO-OHKI then stops as she sees a flower that
has a purplish color, very much like the color of her eyes.

				AEKA
		<picks flower> Royal Tear
		Drop, but how is it -- could
		it be?

A young AEKA is sitting in a field of flowers making a wreath out of
the various plants.  A young YOUSHO walks up to her.

				YOUSHO
		What are you doing out here.

				AEKA
		You left me behind. <raises
		wreath> For you.

				YOUSHO
		Thank you.

YOUSHO bows his head and AEKA puts it on his head.  He picks
her up and rests her on his lap.  She picks up another flower and
shows it to him.

				AEKA
		It’s the color of your eyes.

AEKA puts it in his wreath, he abruptly puts AEKA down and takes
off the wreath.

				AEKA
		What's wrong?

YOUSHO pulls out the flower and holds it up to AEKA.

				YOUSHO
		This is Royal Tear Drop. It
		should not be used for happy
		occasions.

Cut to the firey view of older AEKA holding the Tenchi-Ken to her chest.
She looks down and beside where the sword was just lying is a tiny grove
of Royal Tear Drop.  A tear falls though the air, sparkling as it falls, and 
lands
on the petal of the flower.

AEKA is holding the flower in her hand and crying over it.  RYO-OHKI
appears with a beautiful flower in his mouth and holds it up to AEKA.

				AEKA
		For me?

				RYO-OHKI
		<affirmative> Myaa!

AEKA slowly takes the flower and holds it close.  RYO-OHKI clumsily
climbs up onto AEKA's lap.  She softly pets RYO-OHKI.

				AEKA
		<soft; kind> You silly thing.
		Don't you know that I hate
		you? <soft giggle>

RYO-OHKI raises an ear up high, then jumps to the ground and towards
the forest.  It stops half way and turns to AEKA.

				AEKA
		Where are you going? You'll
		get lost!

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaaa! Myaaaaaa!

RYO-OHKI continues off into the forest, AEKA follows behind trying to
catch up.

Cut to a view of leaves, the camera slowly moves upwards until it is just
above the leaves.  We see TENCHI with a Boduken, repetitively hitting a
log attached to a rope; at his feet are small wooden pedistals which he is
jumping from one to another while hitting the log.  YOUSHO is behind him
looking ever so excited.

				YOUSHO
		Watch your footing, Tenchi …

TENCHI hits the log a few more times, letting out a short "Yaa" each time,
until his foot slips on one of the small pedestals and he falls down.

				YOUSHO
		<sighs> You must concentrate
		more, Tenchi.  <gets up> Now,
		lets start with the standard
		patterns.

TENCHI nods and they place their Boduken's on each other's shoulder. 
The view changes so we see that it is AEKA who is peering through the 
bushes, she suddenly gasps.  TENCHI and YOUSHO begin a set of 
complex fighting maneuvers.

				AEKA (V.O.)
		That swordplay.  It’s the
		fighting style of the Royal
		House of Jurai.  Could it be,
		could they know something
		about my brother Yousho?

AEKA moves to get closer when she loses her footing and falls backwards
into the brush.  TENCHI stops to look and YOUSHO hits him on the head
with an under the leg attack.

				YOUSHO
		Tenchi, whats wrong, your
		a sitting duck.

				TENCHI
		Geeze! Is that part of the
		routine?

				YOUSHO
		<flat> No.

TENCHI moves to the bush and looks down to see AEKA lying almost
upside down.  He turns red and looks away.

				AEKA
		Oh, why? WHY!? Why
		must I suffer this humiliation?
		<looks to TENCHI> Gaak!

AEKA quickly straightens her robe down as respectable as it can be.
TENCHI climbs down to AEKA.

				TENCHI
		Miss Aeka, are you alright?

				AEKA
		I'm fine --

AEKA tries to get up, but her leg gives way beneath her.  She lets out a
cry in pain.  A close up of her leg shows that its bleeding heavily.  YOUSHO
walks down a path leading up to them, he is holding a bandage in his hand.

				YOUSHO
		Well, let me see what we
		have here. <wraps leg>
		Looks like you have a nasty
		cut here.

				AEKA
		Thank you.  Umm, Grandpa,
		that fighting style you were
		jus--

				YOUSHO
		Tenchi, you make sure she
		doesn't walk on this.  You
		better carry her to the house.

YOUSHO walks as quick as he can away from AEKA and back to
his shrine.  AEKA looks at the man questionably.  TENCHI and AEKA 
both turn to each other in confusion.

Cut to RYOUKO searching through AEKA and SASAMI's room. She is opening
up all of the storage units that are in the room.

				RYOUKO
		Where can it be?  Where is
		that damned sword that she
		has?  <sigh> Okay, if I was
		the master key, where would
		I be?

RYOUKO turns to the door and we hear the sound of SASAMI coming up the
stairs.

				RYOUKO
		Oh, boy.  This isn't gonna to
		look good.

RYOUKO jumps backwards and dissapears just as SASAMI opens the door
to the room.

				SASAMI
		Aeka!  Aeka, are you here?

SASAMI jumps as she hears the sound of thunder outside.

Cut to darkness; a door opens and floods the room with light.  TENCHI
walks into the room with AEKA on his back. Outside its pouring rain, 
both TENCHI and AEKA are soaking wet.  TENCHI sits AEKA down on log,
she shivers from the cold.

				TENCHI
		We'll have to wait here until the
 		rain stops.

TENCHI walks over to a pile of boxes and tools.  He picks up a box full
of wood and sets it down between himself and AEKA.  He picks up a ball
of newsprint, lights it with a match, and puts it into the box which
burns brightly.

				TENCHI
		There we go.

TENCHI takes off his shirt and wrings out a towel he had around his 
neck.  He holds the towel out to AEKA, who is still shivering quietly.

				TENCHI
		Here, you can dry yourself
		off with this.  <pauses> Oh,
		I guess I'll, go outside for a
		while.

TENCHI walks out the door and closes it behind himself.  AEKA begins
to take off her wet clothes, after each robe she takes off, she hangs
it over the edge of the log she is sitting on.  She leaves on her 
undermost robe, and uses the towel to dry herself.

In the shadows of the room, a furry figure is leaping around between
baskets of vegitables. It leaps behind basket to basket before 
jumping over and landing on AEKA.  In the light, we see that it was
RYO-OHKI, AEKA doesn't see this.  She screams.

TENCHI hears AEKA's scream and opens the door and runs in.  AEKA
rushes over and hold onto him, placing her head against his chest.

				AEKA
		Oh Tenchi! There's something
		in here!

TENCHI looks back and forth until he sees RYO-OHKI poking her head
out from behind a basket of carrots.

				RYO-OHKI
		<sad> Myaa?

				TENCHI
		Oh, its only Ryo-Ohki.

				AEKA
		Silly thing, scared me half to
		death.

AEKA slowly raises her head and sees that TENCHI is looking right
back at her.  The both stare into each other for an uncomfortable 
moment.

				TENCHI
		<turns head> Oh … <long pause>
		I guess I should go back outside.

TENCHI heads for the door.  He stops just before he's completely 
outside.

				AEKA
		Must be cold outside.

TENCHI pauses and looks back at AEKA.

Cut to the same room, an indeterminate amount of time later, TENCHI
is sitting looking into the fire.  AEKA is a bit farther off to the
side, seeming to be staring off into nowhere.

				AEKA
		I guess I must have 
		misunderstood When I saw you
		with Ryouko I thought that you 
		were her friend.

				TENCHI
		Well, I'm not.  But I get the feeling
		she wants something from me, or
		from grandpa.  She never did tell
		me anything about herself, can
		you, perhaps, tell me what you know?
		You two seem to go back a long way.

				AEKA
		Yes, I suppose we do.  You see,
		about 700 years ago, she attacked
		my home planet of Jurai …

The screen blurs until we see the day RYOUKO attacked Jurai.

				AEKA (V.O.)
		I wasn't much younger than I am 
		now.  She was on a rampage across
		our planet.  From the patrolling ships
		orbiting our planet, she started her 
		attack.  Every ship that crossed her
		path was destroyed, and soon she
		was on the planet surface.  To our
		surprise, she had broken the defense
		field put up by our originating tree,
		Tsunami.  She caused massive 
		damage to all of the Royal Family
		Trees, before someone was able
		to stop her.

The scene blurs again, and we see that same fight scene between
RYOUKO and young YOUSHO again.

				AEKA (V.O.)
		My Brother Yousho was that person.
		Using the Master Key, or Tenchi-Ken,
		he fought her with all his might, finally
		driving her off the planet.

Cut to the shot of the planet with RYO-OHKI flying past the camera,
finally blurring away and cutting back to the room with AEKA and
Tenchi.  AEKA has the Tenchi-Ken in her hand.

				AEKA
		But he wasn't finished.  He took his ship,
		the Funaho, and chased after Ryouko,
		never to return again.  The only thing I
		have of his, is this sword, which he left
		behind for some reason, and these
		unusual gems that have been embedded
		into the sword.

There is an uncomfortable silence.

				TENCHI
		My grandpa used to tell me a story
		about my ancestors.  How they
		came to this land and the fights they
		used to have.  He was always proud
		of one story about a fight with a
		Demon from another world.  He said
		that one of my Ancestors fought a
		powerful Demon that came to Earth
		one day.  He said that he beat the
		Demon and sealed it into the Masaki
		cave, and by doing so, he gained
		the Demon's power, which was sealed
		in the Demon's gems that it wore, giving
		him long life.

				AEKA
		The Demon's gems?

				TENCHI
		He said that the Demon would be
		sealed as long as the gem he took
		continued to power a magic seal
		placed upon the cave.  Grandpa
		said the man's name was
		Yousho.

AEKA jerks her head towards TENCHI and gasps.  She looks at the
Tenchi-Ken and wonders.  There is another uncomfortable pause.

				TENCHI
		Can I ask you a question?  What
		are you going to do now?

				AEKA
		I'll search.  You see, I have no way
		to return to my planet now, so I'll
		continue the search for my brother.
		But it'll be difficult, because I have
		no relatives on this alien planet.

				TENCHI
		<yells> Its all my fault! I caused
		all this.  You can stay here as long
		as you like. <quieter> Besides,
		I guess we're related too.

				AEKA
		Yousho was my half-brother.  Here
		you might find it strange to marry
		your brother, but on Jurai it is not.
		Even though my parents arranged
		it, I was happy with the decision.
		But the thought of not being able
		to share these feelings with him,
		it's … it--

AEKA starts crying.

				TENCHI
		His ship must have crashed here
		just like yours did.  And he was
		forced to …

TENCHI stops, afraid to say something that would make AEKA more
sad.

				TENCHI
		So, … cheer up.  <stands>
		Cheer Up, Aeka.

AEKA stops crying and nods.

RYO-OHKI comes over to TENCHI pulling a basket of carrots.

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaa.

				TENCHI
		What is it? <looks at basket>
		What, you want this Carrot?

TENCHI pulls out a carrot and holds it up for RYO-OHKI.  She jumps
up trying to get the carrot.  He shakes the carrot above RYO-OHKI, 
then throws the carrot over her head.

				TENCHI
		Hop!

RYO-OHKI jumps over to the carrot and picks it up in her mouth.  Her
eyes glisten with joy. AEKA giggles.

				TENCHI
		Carrots, huh?  Eat a lot of those
		and you'll grow up to be a Space
		Ship.  <laughs>

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaa, myaaa!

Cut to ADAM standing by the sliding glass door looking out over the
lake.  SASAMI and RYOUKO are sitting in the living room behind him.

				ADAM
		Looks like the rain has stopped.
		Maybe we should go out and see
		where Aeka and Tenchi are.

				SASAMI
		Good Idea!

				RYOUKO (V.O.)
		Maybe Aeka has that sword with
		her.  Yeah, that’s it!

A loud crash is heard off screen.

				MIHOSHI (O.S.)
		Ooops.

				ADAM
		<sigh> I cleaned up after her last
		time.  It's someone else's turn.

ADAM opens the glass door and walks out, SASAMI and RYOUKO follow
close behind.

Cut to TENCHI walking down a path with AEKA on his back, RYO-OHKI
is also close behind with a bundle of carrots strapped to her back.

				TENCHI
		Would you like to see the Masaki
		cave?  Maybe we can find some
		clues about Yousho.

AEKA looks off to the side of the path.  Cut to a large grove of
trees with one giant tree in the center.

				AEKA
		What's that?

				TENCHI
		Oh, that’s the holy tree of the
		Masaki shrine.  Wonder stories
		hang from it.  One of the stories
		say if you make a wish under a 
		full moon it'll come true.  Another
		story says that if you pray to it
		you can make rain come. Would
		you like to see it?

				AEKA
		<nods> Yes.

AEKA and TENCHI are standing by the giant tree, which is growing in
the middle of a pond with stepping stones all around it.

				AEKA
		There is no doubt.  This is Funaho.

				TENCHI
		Funaho?

				AEKA
		My brother's space ship.  Remember
		there was a tree like this inside of my
		space ship.  It is the heart of the
		space ship.

				TENCHI
		Wow, this turns into one of those
		giant space ships?

				AEKA
		No, this one has taken root, it can't
		become a space ship anymore.

AEKA pulls the Tenchi-Ken out from under her robe and hits it against
the tree a few times.  The end of the Tenchi-Ken sparks for a second and
the leaves of the tree begin to emit rays of multicolored light into
the pond.

				TENCHI
		Wha -- What's happening?

				AEKA
		This is the memory of the tree.

				TENCHI
		The memory …

Everything become inverted for a second, then it fades away and we
see YOUSHO's ship flying into orbit of Earth with RYO-OHKI.  Funaho
fires off a bunch of shot at RYO-OHKI that hit the hull and cause big
explosions and the ship begins to crash.  Funaho follows the ship down.

				AEKA (V.O.)
		That's my brother ship!

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		And that’s Ryo-Ohki!

Ryo-Ohki crashes in a giant supernova into the ground.  Several
scenes flash by of Young YOUSHO and RYOUKO fighting.

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		That must be Yousho.  And look
		at Ryouko, she looks scary.

YOUSHO has one of RYOUKO's gems in his hand, and its fighting with
a normal sword.  RYOUKO keeps making grabs at the gem YOUSHO
has in his hand.  They are fighting in a deep crater.

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		This must be how the lake was made.

RYOUKO makes a sweeping grab for the gem, we see YOUSHO raise his
sword up high and cut down off screen.  Cut to YOUSHO standing next to
a large stone within the Masaki cave, he holds the gem out, then
sticks it into the stone where it becomes slightly embedded. 

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		This must be the imprisonment that
		Grandpa talks about.

Cut to the outside of the cave, much later, a young TENCHI walks up
to the entrance of the cave.

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		That’s me, I couldn't have been more
		than five years old.

Young TENCHI walks deep into the cave and comes up to the stone
that YOUSHO was at before.  He looks at the gem and touches it.  The
gem flares up and glows, separating itself from the stone, and
landing in TENCHI's hand.  The stone then breaks apart, several
pieces of the rock landing on TENCHI, burying him.  RYOUKO appears
in place of the stone and flys away.

				TENCHI (V.O.)
		Oh, my.  I released Ryouko from
		her imprisonment.  I am responsible.

The scene changes one last time to show older YOUSHO and NOBUYUKI
pulling TENCHI from the wreckage.  YOUSHO takes the gem from TENCHI's
hand and secretly puts it in his robes. The images fade away into 
nothing, the lights coming from the tree completely stop.  AEKA and
TENCHI are standing by the tree still.

				AEKA
		He is alive.  I'm sure of it. If
		Funaho is alive, then Yousho
		must be alive as well. <turns>
		I've been mean to you, I've been
		harsh and I apologize.

AEKA holds out the Tenchi-Ken to TENCHI.

				AEKA
		This is yours.

				TENCHI
		I don't understand.

				AEKA
		You are related to my brother
		Yousho, the crown prince of
		Jurai, by blood and I am asking
		you if you would protect us
		until he can be found.

TENCHI looks at the sword solemnly.

				SASAMI (O.S.)
		Aeka!

SASAMI walks across the pond using the stepping stones, RYO-OHKI
is on her shoulder.

				AEKA
		Sasami.

				SASAMI
		I was so worried about you.

				AEKA
		I'm sorry to have troubled you,
		did you come all this way by 
		yourself?

				SASAMI
		Oh, no. Ryouko and Adam was
		with us, and Ryo-Ohki led us
		half the way.

				AEKA
		<laughs> Oh you are such a
		silly thing aren't you?

				RYOUKO (O.S.)
		Now, isn't this a friendly scene.

RYOUKO appears with ADAM holding onto her legs.  He slips off and
lands in the pond.  When he resurfaces, RYOUKO stands on his head.

				ADAM
		That’s the last time I travel with
		YOU Ryouko.

ADAM stops and looks up at RYOUKO, who is on his head.

				ADAM
		<screams> GET OFF!

RYOUKO gives her evil grin and dissapears, then reappears next
to TENCHI.

				RYOUKO
		Tell me Tenchi, why were you
		with this unworthy girl this whole
		time, huh?

				TENCHI
		Because I had to, Okay? Lady
		Aeka hurt herself.

				RYOUKO
		Hey, Tenchi!  Looks like you
		have yourself an interesting
		sword there, mind letting me
		see it?

				TENCHI
		I don't think so Ryouko.  I know
		what your up to.

				RYOUKO
		Up to?  I'm not up to anything.

				TENCHI
		 Yeah, right.

ADAM walks up to them, soaking wet.

				ADAM
		Did I miss a conversation? What
		are you all talking about?

				AEKA
		Lord Tenchi is related to me
		by blood.

				RYOUKO
		Uh-huh.  Isn't that fascinating.
		Well, if you won't even let me
		see your sword, I'm outta here.
		Sheesh, this is what you get for
		trying to help someone.

RYOUKO flies off and disappears.

				ADAM
		Petty isn't she?

				AEKA
		I think its time we headed home
		home now, come Lord Tenchi.

AEKA drags TENCHI across the stepping stones.

				ADAM
		Its never boring here, I'd have
		to say that.

				SASAMI
		No, not at all.

				RYO-OHKI
		Myaa!

SASAMI follows after AEKA and TENCHI.  ADAM turns around and takes
another look at the tree.

				VOICE (V.O.)
		She is a very interesting one.

ADAM spins around and searches for the source of the voice.

				VOICE (V.O.)
		Her power will one day be great.

ADAM continues to look around for the voice.

				ADAM
		What power?  Sasami has power?

				VOICE (V.O.)
		Yes.  Her power is that of all Jurai,
		it is merely being masked by her
		youth.

				ADAM
		<louder> What power?

				VOICE (V.O.)
		You will see her power soon. But
		you wont recognize her.  But her
		power wont be enough, that is why
		I've sent you here.

				ADAM
		<angry> Sent me?! Who is this?
		Who are you?  How are you 
		responsible for my being here?

				VOICE (V.O.)
		You made a deal with me.  I would
		call on you when needed. You
		probably don't remember.

				ADAM
		I don’t remember anything like that.
		Who are you?

				VOICE (V.O.)
		I am the one who is controlling your
		fate now.  You promised me you
		would help me in places I couldn't
		get to myself.  It is very important
		that you be here, now.  I can't
		tell you what to do, but you will know.

				ADAM
		Why me? What did I do to deserve
		this?

				VOICE (V.O.)
		When you have completed everything
		that needs to be done, I'll return for
		you.  I can give you only a warning,
		you are amidst beings of enormous
		power, don't forget that you have none.

				ADAM
		Wait!  Who are you? What does all
		that mean!  <screams> WAIT!

The camera pans backwards until ADAM is just a speck.  Cut to space,
a large ship flies past, blanketing a planet in darkness.  It changes
its course and points itself towards Earth.

Authors Notes:
	It is very important that you know something.  While WE the readers knows 
who YOUSHO is, the characters don’t.  While I've always called Tenchi's 
grandfather Yousho, it must be noted that Tenchi himself doesn't know that his 
name really is Yousho, nor does anyone else in the story.
	As is quiet obvious, this is different in MANY respects to the OAV Ep. 3 
that it was modeled after.  First of all, Tenchi didn't meet Ryouko by 
releasing her from the cave, he met her when she crashed into Earth after being 
chased by Mihoshi.  So I had to make up something that would explain how Ryouko 
was imprisoned AND still was free to be chased by Mihoshi.
	Wondering where Yousho is hiding that third gem of his? Well, he needs it 
to be near so that it can give power to his tree, Funaho.  But we've never seen 
him with the gem hanging from his ear.  So where could that gem be?  I guess 
you'll find out in the next part.

	Concerning the Voice:  This is one of the underlining themes in the Full 
Circle series.  The Voice made a deal with Adam when he was younger, somewhere 
around the age of 16 or 17 (i.e. - the "Magical Girl" age), that he would do 
tasks for the Voice that the Voice could not do itself.  The younger Adam 
thought that the Voice would call on him soon, it never did.  Now that he's 22, 
he's sort of forgotten about it. There IS a reason why the Voice chose Adam for 
this, and why he accepted, but that's another story.
	Oh, if you know anything about me as an author you can guess who the 
Voice REALLY is.  And if you aren't familiar with my works, I'll just tell you 
now, that the Voice is Setsuna-san, better known as Sailor Pluto.
