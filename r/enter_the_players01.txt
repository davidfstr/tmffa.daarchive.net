Author's note: this is my first attempt at a Tenchi Muyo fanfic. Please 
don't assassinate me. This has the same properties as the OAV. (original 
Anime Version) Washu created Ryoko; Tenchi freed her, blah blah. This is 
essential to my, heheh, evil plans. Send comments, flame-throwers, threats 
and cheesecakes to fupuntomuk@hotmail.com

Claimer: Ariac and Tsaraara are property of S.M.A.K. Productions (. If you 
want to use them, e-mail me. I might let you use 'em.. But not until I say, 
because there are things you should know about her. Ariac. You'll have to 
see about Tsaraara.

Tenchi Muyo: Enter the Players
Chapter one: Crash Landings

"This is the life." Ariac sighed as she leaned on the chair in the middle of 
her spaceship and friends, Nat'retak.
"Miyaa." He sighed.  Ariac grinned and patted the floor. She had waist-long, 
wolf-gray hair and crimson eyes laced with amber. Ariac was a 
space-explorer, she never stopped in one place for too long. She had grown 
up on a planet called Earth. She had never known her parents. The Galaxy 
Police had taken full responsibility of her. They had told her grand tales 
of rich heroes. She had always loved them to tell her of her parents, and 
she was proud. She had started on her quest with a small spaceship with a 
meager engine, and landed on a planet called Terral. There she found a 
wailing, weak animal in a gutter that later proved to be a cabbit. How it 
ended up there, she never knew. At the moment she was going past earth, just 
to see it as she continued her quest.
"Miyya! Mimimiyaaaa!" Nat suddenly cried.  A view screen popped up in front 
of Ariac, and a crystal with the cabbit's face on it hovered to her side. 
His fur was solid black, with a white gem on his forehead. His eyes were 
copper, like a penny.  The view screen showed nothing but stars.
"I don't get it. What, Nat?" The cabbit looked at its view screen, 
sweat-dropped anime style, and took it down. He was about to put another one 
up when a tremendous crash shattered the air.
"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAK!" Ariac sputtered, flying from her chair. Nat gave 
an agonized miaw.
"What the heck was that!?" Ariac cried, regaining her seat. The view screen 
once again appeared, this time showing an enormous spaceship lodged at their 
side, pushing them forward.
"Get the comm systems on!" Nat obeyed, muttering to himself, and the view 
screen changed to show the inside of the other ship. It showed a distressed 
woman. She had aqua hair, tied back in a loose braid, and penetrating eyes. 
She was dressed in very complicated attire, the fabric ranging from opaque 
to nearly invisible, with earthen colors ranging from brown to gray to 
black. Her fingers flew over the keyboard ahead of her, and she talked while 
she typed.
"Sorry about that. My name's Tsaraara. I mean it, I'm really, really sorry. 
I hope I didn't hurt your.. uhh... cabbit."
"My name is Ariac. Forgive me if I sound rude, but" at this she paused, 
leaning forward in her chair. "WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!?"
"Chill, chill. I'm getting into my security codes at the moment.." she typed 
in a few more rapid words.
"Darnit!" she screamed, pounding her fists into the keyboard.
"What? What happened?"
"A source of unknown origin has tapped into my ship's systems. It's locked 
the primary systems; I can't control the ship. I'm into the secondary 
systems right now... HOLY CRAP!" she cried as the keyboard exploded. Ariac 
gasped, but could do nothing.  The screen was covered with thick smoke, then 
faded out. Several minutes passed. There was a beep, and Tsaraara once again 
appeared on the screen.
"I hate to tell you this, but that source, it left a 'computer grenade' in 
my secondary system's codes. A computer grenade," Saraara continued before 
Ariac could ask, "is an automated command that backfires from the ship's 
cannons into the point where it is being accessed.  In this case, the 
keyboard."
"So this is bad new?"
"Absolutely. I can't control my ship. It's going on auto-pilot, has been 
since last night."
"Can me and Nat break away?"
"Who?"
"Nat, my ship!"
"Oh. No, I'm afraid you can't. my ship's going to fast, and one of 'Nat's' 
spikes has penetrated my hull."
"WELL WHAT THE HECK ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?!"
"Relax. We're going to crash into a planet."
"A WHAT!?"
"A planet. It's called Earth. It's inhabited be huma-"
"Yeah, yeah, I know 'bout earth."
Tsaraara scowled. "Anyway," she continued, "We're gonna land on a small 
island called Okayama. Extensive scans reveal a very small body of water 
where we will land."
Ariac gulped. "Nat, show me Straight ahead, will ya?"
"Miyaa."
The screen changed to show a very big planet, one of which they were almost 
through the atmosphere.
".... That was quick."
"Exactly." Said Tsaraara from behind her.
Ariac spun, giving a small shriek of surprise.
"How'd you get here?"
"I transported."
"Uhh.. you could've just asked, ya know."
"Look!"
The view screen was no longer needed. Nat had turned his sides transparent, 
showing a small speck of land growing very close very fast...

	Tenchi Masaki sighed happily as he swept the porch. No matter how many 
times he swept it, it always stayed dusty. He loved the peace and quiet of 
life in the country. He lived on the small isle of Okayama. Many, many 
months before, he had freed a demon. That started all this chaos. But now 
things were quiet. Now life was peaceful. Sort of.  He grinned as he heard 
Mihoshi, a member of the Galaxy Police, snoring on the couch.
	"Lord Tenchi, would you like me to take care of that?" said a somewhat high 
voice from behind him. He turned to see the crowned princess of Jurai, 
Ayeka. She smiled and gently took the broom.
	"Thanks Ayeka. Where is everybody? The only person I've heard besides you 
today is Mihoshi."
	Ayeka began sweeping. "Mihoshi, obviously, is in the living room sleeping. 
Sasami and Washu went on a 'nature walk' in the woods. Ryo-Ohki went with 
them. Kiyone decided to go to the market. I don't think she'll buy 
anything."
"Why?"
Ayeka giggled. "She left her wallet here."
"She won't get far without that!"
"True. Father is.. Somewhere, frankly I'm not sure, and Grandfather is 
resting. Ryoko," a tinge of distaste hinted in her voice, "is somewhere, 
either on the roof or in a tree. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some 
sweeping to do."
Tenchi nodded and started off to the lake. It looked so calm and clear 
today. The smooth surface was like glass.
"Hiya Tenchi!" called a familiar voice. A little girl, followed by a short, 
pink-haired woman and a cabbit, ran up to him.
"Hi Sasami. How was your nature walk?"
"Pretty neat. Washu saw Ryoko sitting in a tree and started going off about 
her," Sasami stopped, and looked to Washu.
"Behavioral habits. Just a little fun. I'm gonna do it to everybody. Onward, 
explorers!" she exclaimed, and they trotted off to the house. Tenchi could 
hear her now.
"Ayeka. Crowned princess of Jurai. Herbivorous mostly, but can eat meat. 
This strange creature delights itself in stroking a broad wooden platform 
with a strange implement, even if this 'porch' is clean. It summons two logs 
called 'Azaka' and 'Kamadake' when threatened. Has an ENOURMOUS crush on 
Tenchi.."
"Hi Tenchi." Purred another voice in his ear.
Tenchi jumped, but knew who it was.
"Oh, hi, Ryoko."
The cyan-haired demoness floated down until she was seated beside Tenchi. 
Then she threw her arms around him and gazed at him with her cat-like eyes.
"What're you doing?"
"Just looking at the pond. It's so beautiful."
"Hmm." She murmured, nuzzling his side. He was about to protest, and so was 
Ayeka.
But something came up.
With an almighty "MIYAAAAAA!" Nat, Tsaraara, and Ariac landed in the middle 
of the lake.
