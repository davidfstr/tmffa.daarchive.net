This Fan Fiction is set in the Ova and NNFT Manga
universe shortly
after the
conclusion of the Bizen affair. Warning this is a self
insertion of a
sort
though I think that this will be a tad diff from
others for reasons
that’ll
become obvious later. This begins 1,000 years ago and
as we discover
the
theft of the Royal Tree Bizen wasn’t the only tradgedy
on Jurai that
fateful
night. That said let the games begin.

PROLOGUE

It was evening on Jurai the night was alive with
colors and sounds.
Fireworks
filled the sky while processions of Royal Trees moved
thru the streets
over
flowing with rejoicing people. At a corner a group
stand watching a
Public
Information Broadcast on a huge screen "And the
celebrations have begun
all
over Jurai and thru out her territories as the
Stardica Festival
officialy
begins. This however marks an historic event in our
lives for this also
marks
the celebration of our victory over The Telarian
Empire over two months
ago.
The end of the six month conflict brings to a close
the age old threat
of the
militaristic Telarians and heralds in a new age of
Galactic peace and
prosperity. And now for a statement from King Toma who
valiantly led
our
courageous forces in the final battle at Telar itself
given earlier
today."
The commentator is replaced by the image of a tall,
regal older man
dressed
in the robes of Jurai’s Royal Family. His long black
hair is streaked
with
grey as is his beard a cruel scar recently healed
across his left cheek
mars
his other wise handsome features. "My loyal subjects
while I am
relieved that
this long period of our history is over it pains me to
my very soul
that the
Telarians chose to refuse our requests for their
surrnder and instead
chose
to destroy themselves. It is a dark day when an entire
race embraces
oblivion
to peace." The view shifts back to the commentator
"That was given
after the
memorial service for Grand Admiral Tanaka and the
others who perished
in what
is being called The Battle of Telar. The Ministry of
Public Information
has
confirmed the the devestation of all Telarian
inhabited worlds by what
is
believed to have been some kind of linked fusion
device system emplaced
to
deny use of the planets to invaders and to prevent the
Telarians
themselves
from being captured. Thosee worlds belonging to their
various subject
races
rose up in revolt throwing off the shacles of Imperial
tyranny and
welcoming
our forces and those of the Galaxy Police with open
arms. On ot!
her related news The GP have still been unabole to
track down the
whereabouts
of the wanted criminal Dugalin HighSwordMaster to the
Imperial Family
and the
only known survivor of the Imperial Court.. The last
confirmed sighting
was
of his ship the Star Falcon breaking thru the Royal
Fleet and fleeing
Telar
moments before it was destroyed by it’s own
inhabitants. Dugalin is
wanted in
connection to numerous thefts and the destruction of
historic relics
and
sites committed by the Space Pirates Kagato and Ryoko
According to
sources he
attacked a GP squadron in The Alpha System allowing
the Pirates to
escape
with a priceless artifact. In other news.." Atop a
nearby building a
shadow
watches with hateful eyes "Spread what lies you wish
Toma but know that
I
will write the final act of this play!". An hour later
an explosion
blows out
the windows of the King’s private quarters within The
Royal Palace.
Iside the
hallway outside the main study smoke fills the air and
the sound of
some
immense blow being landed rings thru the air. The
study’s thick wooden
doors
are reduced to a shower of splinters by a body
hurtling thru the air as
if
shot from a cannon. The person strikes the far wall
with enough force
to
embed themself into the very stone. Toma King of Jurai
coughs up blood
as he
slids down against the wall his armor rent and charred
and the chest
plate
almost completely caved in by a single blow. Groaning
in agony he
struggles
to stand only to collapse in a spasm of pain, the
brilliant blue blade
of The
Tenchiken winks out as it slips from his grasp. Off to
the left a young
boy
in his early teens runs around the corner, seeing the
fallen King he
screams
"GRANDFATHER??!!" and starts foreward only to slide to
a stop as a tall

shadow strides out of the room into the hass wreathed
in smoke and
flame. The
figure is illuminated by a flickering source of light
that the boy
can’t see
till the shadow walks across the floor towards the
King. Clenched in
his
right hand is a long double-bladed sword, etchings
glowing with the!
ir own light run along the length of the spine as
golden flame encases
the
blade. The smoke shifts allowing the boy to see the
stranger clearly,
the
figure is clad in black plate armor trimmed in gold of
an alien design
(HIM??
How did he GET IN HERE??"). The figure leans down
grasping Toma by the
collar
and jerks him up like a ragdoll to dangle two feet off
the floor before

slamming himback into the wall. The King cries out in
pain and almost
if in
response his two Knight’s round the corner to the
right at a run coming
to a
halt at the sight before them. Seemingly unconcerned
with the new
arrivals
the intruder leans his helmeted head close to Toma’s
ear and whispers
something then Toma mummbles back a reply. Drawing his
head back
"Anything?
Anything that I desire? I need only speak it?" the
strangers mussess.
Toma
jerkily shakes his head and again the stranger
whispers something. The
battered Monarch shakes his head desperately "I..I...I
can’t do
THAT!!!"
shear terror rising in his voice, at this both the boy
and the Knights
yell
at the intruder to release the King as they start
towards them at a
run.
Drawing the flaming sword back the man screams in fury
"Then you WILL
DIE YOU
FILTHY BASTARD!!!" and drives the blade thru the
King’s stomach and
into the
wall itself with enough force that the wing like
crossguards crack open

Toma’s chestplate. A horrible shriek rises up from
Toma as he franticly
grabs
at the man’s hand in a feeble attempt to pull the
blade free. Not
wasting a
moment on the others the Stranger voice rises as well
in raw hate
deeper than
anything the boy had ever heard "BURN IN HELL TOMA!!!!
YOU MURDERING
SCUM
BURN!!!!!". The fire of the sword explodes into a
torrent that engulfs
both
men but leaves the shadow warrior untouched. Not so
Toma his scream
becomes
an inhuman wail that rings thru the Palace before it
mercifuly falls
silent.
With no visible effort the intruder wrenches his sword
free of the wall
and
Toma allowing him to slump to the floor in a
smoldering heap. Pausing
for a
moment h!
e pulls something from his belt and drops it on the
fallen King then
turns to
close with the on rushing Knights. Reaching his
Grandfather Yosho falls
to
his knees in tears sickened by the smell coming from
the nightmare
before
him. Toma is little more than a blackened skeleton
held together by his

charred armor, thru his tears he spies something out
of place a single
purple
flower (A...Royal Teardrop?). Down the hall the three
warriors come to
a stop
facing off their warstaves held at the ready the two
Royal Knights
block the
hall "You know that we can’t ALLOW you to escape this
time?" aks the
older
gray-haired Knight. The younger red-headed Knight
speaks up "We are
truly
sorry that it has come to this, but our duty demands
that we stop
you.". The
dark warrior bows his head to them "I had hoped to
avoid THIS
confrontation.....SHE asked me to spare you if I
could.". Bowing their
heads
in sympathy the Knights reply "We are truly sorry for
your loss...she
deserved better."the older one, "But DUTY requires
what it does!
replies the
warrior "I know and I hope you understand that I must
do what I must!"
snapping up his sword into a guard position and
advancing down the
hall.
Springing to either side the two Jurians leap half way
up the walls
then kick
off them to hurtle at their foe. Parrying with his
sword the dark
warrior
simultaneously lashes out with a side kick that knocks
aside the weapon
of
the younger Knight as he comes in under his partner.
Back down the hall
Yosho
watches as the three exchange blows and parries faster
than the eye can
see,
the air rings with the clash of weapons and sparks
light the hall as
their
powers clashed. Suddenly a viscious backhand sends the
older Knight
flying
backwards to land on his back quickly followed by his
comrade. Raising
his
blade in a salute "You are both skilled warriors and
in different
circumstances I’d gladly call you friends. However you
are not my
equals and
cannot hope to stop me so I warn you one last time
STAND ASIDE!!"the
warrior
implores. The two get to t!
heir feet shaking their heads "NEVER!!" and both
staves begin to glow
as they
focused their power into them. Seeing the crystals
atop the staves
pulse with
light even as he feels the power itself the dark
warrior plants his
feet
apart and begins to spin his sword in a circle before
him "PHEONIX
SHIELD!".
Yosho watches as a disc of golden flame forms infront
of the intruder
hie
eyes widening in fearful recognition
"NO!!!!AZAKE....KAMIDAKE
STOP...DON’T DO
THAT!!!!" but his warning comes to late. Down the hall
the Knights
unleash
their ultimate attack techniques twisting beams of
energy one blue the
other
red arc toward the intruder who makes no move to avoid
them. Both
attacks
strike the flaming disc and the two Jurians are
blinded as the hall is
filled
with a flash of light like a star, after a moment
their sight returns
and
both stare in awe. They couldn’t beleive their eyes
for there unharmed
stood
the intruder still spinning his blade the disc growing
in intensity as
the
last of the blue and crimsn energy is absorbed into
it. Finaly they
heard the
young Prince’s yelling "RUN!!!GET AWAY NOW!!" neither
knew what he was
warning them about but they could feel the power
before them. However
by the
time they realized the danger it was too late again.
Snapping the sword
to a
stop the warrior drove it into the stone floor
"FLAMESTRIKE!!" an aura
of
power erupted around him in the shape of a firebird
then the disc
discharged
into a collossal bolt of energy that rocked the Palace
to it’s very
foundations. When the smoke cleared he looked around
for any sighn of
the two
but saw nothing amidst the fire, smoke and collasping
sections of the
roof
and floor. "Foregive me?" reaching out with his senses
he located their

fading auras but knowing more guards were on the way
he started to make
his
way thru thru the debris. From behind a scream of rage
erupts as a
unimaginable pain lances thru him "AAARRRGGHHHH!!!!!",
starring down he
finds
a pulsating blue energy blade protruding from his
chest. Grunting in
effort
as he gra!
pples with the pain he kicks a leg back connecting
with his attacker
and
sends them flying back, the blade is torn out and he
nearly crumples.
(NO!!!
I must...NOT...fail now.) shutting away the pain he
turns around
raising his
sword to slay whomever the coward is and freezes as
his eyes spot the
attacker. It was the young Prince struggling to his
feet out of breath
from
the kick the boy holds the Master Key before him at
the ready. Refusing
to
show any of the fear that filles him Yosho locked eyes
with the
towering
shadow of death the loomed over him. Thru the visor of
the great
flaring helm
he could see the hate and the raw fury along with grim
determination
radiating from those brown eyes (I’m going to DIE!) he
thought. The
moment
seems to last an age before the man’s eyes appear to
shift away as if
to look
at something behind him even as Yosho wondered a sense
of calm filled
him and
the Master Key deactivated. The man returned his gaze
to Yosho the rage
was
gone replaced by sorrow and sense of losss that
reached to the very
center of
the Jurian’s soul. Letting out a ragged breath the
warrior lowers his
weapon
"This war....is over!...Vengeance
and..justice.....have been....served.

...I..must go now....other ..duties still...await..BUT
..we will..meet
again..YOUNG YOSHO!"seeing the boy cringe back he
chuckles despite the
pain
"Worry not...it will be...in another
time...perhaps..life but I...make
you
this vow...Never again..will I raise...my sword
against...your
House...farewell!". Turning away he stalks off into
the wreckage as the
sound
of approaching feet reaches Yosho looking back the way
he came he sees
a
horde of guards burst out from around the corner.
Turning back he finds
the
dark warrior gone only a puddle of blood and the
destruction to mark
his
presence. Swarming over the area they quickly discover
the true
magnitude if
the twin diseasters that have struck this evening "The
king is DEAD!!",
"The
vault and The Royal Nursery have been broken into!",
"A TREE has been
STOLEN!!!". Pushing thru the c!
rowd of guards Azursa Crown Prince of Jurai finds his
son kneeling over
the
body of his father cradling a flower and The Master
Key in his hands,
his
face wet with tears "By Tsunami Son! What has happened
here?" Looking
up
into’s his Fathers grief striken face Yosho speaks
only a single name
"Dugalin!"

The universe is comprised of countless different
dimensions with time
passing
very differently from plane to plane. Many are even
removed from the
flow of
time alltogether and these Higher planes are the
domains of beings such
as we
can only call Gods or Powers. One such plane is
composed of pure energy
given
physical form by it’s ruler’s will from within his
vast Palace. Within
this
structure is a vast courtroom where the very walls are
windows showing
the
numerous lower planes and realities that are of
intrest to him. The
Ruler of
this place sits upon a raised throne a towering figure
of light in the
rough
shape of a humanoid. Like many such beings his
appearance varies
according to
the perceptions of the species seeing him but to
humans he would appear
as an
ageless man clad in crimson robes with arcane symbols
sewn in gold and
silver
covering it and long copper hair flowing freely down
his back. Sitting
he
stares at the Lesser Power before him a huge eagle
like creature with a

majestic crest and feathers of crimson and gold. it’s
brown slitted
eyes
however gleam with the light of intelligence. The
vassal keeps his head
bowed
as his Lord continues his beratement of him. "You were
warned already
not to
involve yourself in their dispute and dispite that you
still INTERFERED

Pheonix!!" the eagle relpied "And if I had not then
both would have
perished
and been consumed My Lord!" This only seemed to make
his Lord angrier
"IRRELEVENT!!!!.....However I could understand your
reasons for aiding
HER
and her sister I was even generous enough to overlook
that
transgression and
hide you from the OTHERS wrath. All under the
condition that you cease
to
meddle in this affair and I’ve now learned that you’ve
disobeyed me YET

AGAIN!" Raising his crested head as to look at his
Lord Pheonix
responded
innocently "BUT My Lord? How? Have I not been
attending to my various
other
duties to you?" The man dose from his throne in fury
"DON’T SPLIT HAIRS
WITH
ME!!!!" his voice shaking the entire plane, then
calming somewhat "I
KNOW!
 that you’ve been dispatching Avatars to do your
snooping. Do you DENY
this?"
Pheonix "No Milord!" His master walked down the steps
towards him "You
are to
be punished this time!" and upon reaching the floor
bega to pace around
his
rebellionus servant "And I’ve already decided upon the
method. You are
to be
banished your memory and power sealed untill such time
as I believe
that you
have proven yourself worthy of them again. You’ll
exist amongst the
MORTALS
till then." The eagle bowed his head in acceptance
then in a worried
tone
asked "Where am I to be banished to Sire?" and the
Lord smiled secretly
at
him "Despite your disobedience regarding this matter
your past service
has
been acceptable....you may choose yourself. NOW BE
GONE!". With a cry
Pheonix
rose into the air with a sweep of his wings
tranforming into a firebird
of
cosmic flames then hurtling himself into one of the
walls to seemingly
vanish. Walking over to that wall the man concentrated
upon it and it
began
to shift focusing upon a single star system orbiting a
yellow primary.
He
watched as a golden pinprick of light arrowed towards
the third planet
a
small green and blue world and vanished into it’s
atmosphere before
returning
the wall to it’s former scale. From out of a shadowy
doorway a figure
steps
into the room "You KNEW he would go there?" The Lord
turned to regard
his
guest with a knowing smile "AN educated guess shall we
say? That’s what
free
will is about anyway, it keeps things intresting at
least to me." then
looking back at the wall "Then I do KNOW what he found
in that
dimension so
it wasn’t hard to figure out he’d wind up on that out
of the way little

world." The guest frowned "It’s only a matter of time
untill SHE learns
what
is there! Are you not concerned that his presence will
alert her to
your
intrest?" The other chuckled "Trust me to arrange
things better than
that Old
Freind! As he is now even if she notices him she’ll
never recognize him
or
even suspect what he is."Considering that the Guest’s
frown deepened
"YOu’ve
redu!
ced him to less than one of his Avatars! What use will
he be in that
state?"obviously confused. "I’ve hidden parcels of his
power for him to
find
and his previously used Avatar’s mind will be there to
guide him to
where he
needs to be. Once there the abilities left to him will
suffice if he’s
as
smart as I think he is."he replied with a even greater
smile "This will
be
the most important game I’ve ever dared play and I
intend to have a
secret
piece in position before SHE even enters the arena.
Then it will be up
to him
and those he finds."

Well folks this is the revised set up for the story,
Hope you liked it.

Chapter 1 will introduce a new chatacter to the Masaki
house. Who is
this
stranger and why does Washu and him feel like they’ve
met before as
usual no
one who shows up at Tenchi’s door is ever what they
seem. Please send
me your
critiques, suggestions or just your opinion at
