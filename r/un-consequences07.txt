Chapter #7: Of Love ... and Death! 
Well folks, it seems another madman has Tenchi and the gang  
in his sights. Will he succeed, and what about Saturday's  
events. Will they be affected as well? We'll see Next!! 
Early Wednesday 
Ayeka awoke to a comforting site. To her left was Ryoko with an arm 
around her neck. To her right was Tenchi  
holding her by her waist. Then she remembered the horrible dreams she 
had.  
She remembered Lord Garyu's threat, and she snuggled to her two 
companions and closed her eyes.  
(Oh, For Tsunami's sake, Please don't let them be hurt ...by me!)  
She held both close to her as she went back to an uneasy sleep. 
That morning 
Sasami was the first awake and after she had started breakfast she was 
the first to Tenchi's room to wake the trio. 
"Hey you guys, time to wake up! Breakfast will be ready in ten 
minutes." 
"Thanks Sasami. We'll be down in time." said Tenchi, still groggy from 
the last nights happenings. 
"Oh who was that, Tenchi dear?" asked an equally groggy Ryoko. 
"It was Sasami telling us to get up and be at breakfast in ten 
minutes." 
"Tenchi, should we wake Ayeka up?" 
"No, Let her sleep. After what happened she needs her rest." 
"Yeah, your right. She did go through allot last night. "(Then she 
thought of something) 
"I'll talk to her to help her get through the trauma of being 
controlled by another." 
"You're right, I'll remind you when I go to the fields OK?" 
"Yeah, except I do need my morning kiss first". They then kissed warmly 
as two lovers would,  
then he went to the bathroom to shower and get dressed,  while Ryoko 
phased  
into her blue and gold striped dress. They met up a few minutes later 
and walked downstairs. 
As this was taking place, A subspace portal opened in Tenchi's room a 
few feet from the sleeping Princess.  
A voice from inside the portal spoke "Come Ayeka! Come to me!"  
The Princess awoke with a green glow in her eyes and stood up from her 
futon.  
She then turned to the man behind the voice who had by now stepped out 
of the portal and held his  
hand out to her. She looked at him expressionless and passively and 
slowly walked toward him. 
Downstairs Washu flew out of her lab and yelled for Ryoko  
and Tenchi. Subspace portal, ... in ... your room ... Now! Without 
hesitation Ryoko changed into her battle suit,  
While Tenchi twisted the ring given to him by Ayeka to switch tohis 
battle suit.  
She then grabbed his hand and teleported to his room 
The arrived just between a mind controlled Ayeka, and Lord Garyu.  
"You dare to step in front of my Love your degenerate Jurian!"  
bellowed the small but maniacal madman. 
"Who are you to take someone against her will? She is my fianc‚ as 
well, so I will not allow it!"  
stated a now angry Tenchi. 
"You Jurians, now satisfied with your slut here, you want to take such 
pure loveliness as well.  
NO I will not allow it!" stated a now furious Garyu. 
"TAKE THAT BACK! YOU BASTARD!" Tenchi Yelled as he ignited Tenchi-ken. 
"No, and to prove it, My dear kill them!" Said a now smug Garyu. 
Without warning two shafts of light appeared through the  
abdomens of Tenchi, and Ryoko! They both turned around in shock and 
disbelief at Ayeka,  
in battle gear was holding the two light swords that were going through 
them.  
"AAyekkaa, Why?" was all Tenchi said before he fell down,  
followed seconds later by a now unconscious Ryoko. Reality suddenly 
came to Ayeka as her loved one lay in front of her.  
Garyu's control had broken in the realization to Ayeka of what she was 
forced to do.  
She remembered what Ryoko had told her of Kagato's control of her, and 
the unspeakable acts she had to endure.  
Now she herself had done the same, only now it was the man she loved 
with all her heart, and her best friend  
and sister to be! She collapsed and wailed as Garyu tried to regain his 
hold on her. 
Finally failing, he pulled out a weapon and pointed it as the 
distraught Princess.  
"Get up my Princess, I will take you away from all this filth!" Garyu 
said.  
This got the attention of Ayeka. She stopped wailing and crying.  
She looked up and composed herself.  
She bent down and kissed both Tenchi and Ryoko and slowly got up and 
stepped over their bodies.  
As she did this, Washu and Mihoshi whom had been alerted by her wrist 
communicator had teleported  
just as this happened, grabbed both Tenchi, and Ryoko and dragged them 
down to  
Washu's lab.  
Sasami, who wanted to go up and confront Garyu and her sister, was held 
back by a just arrived  
Katsuhito (Yousho) who also sensed what was going on. When she saw 
Ryoko and Tenchi  
being dragged by Washu and Mihoshi, she screams loudly. 
Garyu had a smile as he heard the scream from down stairs as he turned 
to face Ayeka.  
"Well, my dear ready to go?" asked a now smug Garyu As he looked in her 
eyes,  
a blue glow had replaced the Green that had signified his control over 
her.  
As he realized too late that he was over confidant, a wall of blue 
enveloped the Princess.  
It looked very familiar. 
She kept her gaze on him as he realized that it was a light hawk wing, 
which split into two.  
One enveloped the Princess and as it went through her, her battle suit 
changed into a  
bright white Kimono with pink highlights.  
(Ed note: similar to the one worn By Achika in the Tenchi Movie. 
"Tenchi Muyo in Love".)  
"You made me Kill the man I love, and my Best friend and sister to be!  
And you think you will tell me to do anything more now.  
You will not LIVE TO SAY ANOTHER WORD!" She took the other wing,  
made a light hawk staff and with a mighty scream she cleaved the 
stunned madman  
before he could do anything. 
In the moments that followed, Ayeka had stayed in the same position 
over the now dead Garyu.  
Frozen in anger and loss. She moved for nothing and no one, until 
Sasami and Yousho  
made their way to the now ruined and bloody room.  
They stared at Ayeka who was still in her light hawk suit and still 
held the staff.  
Sasami made her way in front of the frozen grief stricken and raging 
sister.  
She then tried to speak to her. 
"Ayeka! Ayeka? Please Ayeka can you hear me, sister?" Sherepeated 
herself several more times as she tried to reach her.  
Finally, she lost that zoned out look and unclenched her handsaround 
the staff.  
The staff and the Kimono dissipated; leaving Ayeka in her blood 
splattered clothes.  
The blood of her loves. She finally focused on Sasami's face, she then 
started to wail again,  
grabbing her sister and sobbing in her arms. Sasami looked at Yousho 
and understood.  
He quietly went to his sisters, and gently picked up his sobbing sister 
from  
Sasami's grasp. He took her downstairs to Washu's lab.

Washu's Lab 
Washu and her lab robots were working in double time. Trying to save 
her daughter and future son-in-law.  
She had gotten them into stasis tubes before all life had expired in 
the two.  
Now she was desperately working to save their lives with all the means 
at her disposal.  
She had gotten Yousho toopen her lab from the entrance in their bedroom 
at the shrine,  
and with the help of a now distraught Mihoshi had dragged them to the 
lab from the room  
where Ayeka had run them through. Washu didn't think of that now, that 
was something to be acted on later.  
She now focused on the trying to save the ones she loved in the tubes. 
As she worked to save Tenchi and Ryoko, Yousho carried Ayeka into the 
Lab. 
"GET HER OUT OF HERE!" was all Washu could say, as she took a wrench 
laying nearby and headed for them. 
"IT WASN'T HER FAULT, GARYU CONTROLLED HER!" Yousho who used his Jurai 
power to grabbed the  
wrench from Washu's hand before she had a chance to swing it at the 
crying Princess. 
"What do you mean, she was controlled?" yelled Washu. 
"I saw it, she had the same green glow Ryoko had when she was 
controlled by Kagato.  
"Do you understand now Washu?" said Yousho as he laid the sobbing Ayeka 
on a bed next to the stasis tubes.  
She stared down to her feet trying to comprehend what Yousho had said 
to her.  
Then it slowly dawned on her how she almost did the same thing that 
Ayeka, and before her Ryoko had done.  
Killed an innocent while under another's control. Only she had control 
... of herself.  
She shook her head, and without a word went to the distraught Princess 
and gave her a sedative  
to make hersleep. Then before she went back to work, she walked to face 
Yousho and lovingly kissed and hugged him.  
"Thank you, Yousho, for making me see through the haze of rage and 
anger, and see the reality of what happened."  
He returned her hug, and replied; "I will always try to be your voice 
of conscience, just as you will be mine, My love!"  
They let each other go and with quiet instructions Yousho helped Washu 
tend to the three stricken family members.  
Sasami who had witnessed the whole thing slowly made her way to the lab 
entrance to get Mihoshi to help her clean the  
house up. She met the whimpering GP who then told her Nobuyuki was 
heading home to help.  
_______________________________________________________________________
___________________________________ 
Later that night: 
As dinner time came Sasami was making a smaller than normal dinner.  
Three members were either incapacitated or unconscious.  
While two more were working on saving them.So, o  
nly three were at the dinner table as Sasami served them. 
As Sasami, Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi were eating, Washu and Yousho came out 
of the lab looking haggard and tired.  
Sasami raced into the kitchen to serve them dinner. Nobuyuki then asked 
as they settled into their seats.  
"Well Father, Miss Washu, how are they?" They looked at each other, and 
Washu answered. 
"Ryoko is going to be fine. She should be back to normal by Saturday." 
"And Tenchi?" asked a hesitant Sasami. 
"He's going to be in bed for at least 2 weeks as his internalorgans 
heal and my nanobots help  
rebuild his nervous system. He will probably need to rehabilitate 
physically through the summer,  
and should be back to 100 percent by the end of August.  
Yousho will help him and for a much shorter time, Ryoko with rebuilding 
their bodies and skills." 
"And Ayeka, will she be all right?" asked an abnormally silent Mihoshi. 
Washu sighed. "She will probably need several months ofpsychotherapy, 
probably with a colleague I know  
from the Science Academy. I will call in to help her. I will also need 
Tenchi and Ryoko to be in the  
sessions since they, as well as her were ...victims here. We all need 
to help them now." 
"Did it affect ...their babies?" Sasami finally asked. 
"I ... don't know, Sasami, until the tests Saturday, it still too 
soon." stated Washu.  
With Ryoko it could be something that might affect development  
since her injury was quite close to the uteral area, but with Ayeka,  
the stress she went through might have affects immediately, or that may 
not surface for years.  
We'll have to see. 
"So they might lose them?" Sasami asked again. 
"Yes, it's a possibility."  
Then Washu got up from the low dining room table, and made her way to 
the sliding glass  
door that looks out on to the lake. Yousho had also gotten up and came 
to stand behind her.  
Then Washu finally broke down. With all of the pressure and grief of 
the day hitting her like a sledge hammer.  
She fell to her knees and Yousho was there to hold and comfort her.  
At the table, Mihoshi and Sasami were now crying in Nobuyuki's arms  
as all that could be heard was the crying of the female members of the 
household, and  
the quiet reserve,  and watering eyes of the 2 men who comforted them.

Back in the Lab Next Morning: 
Ayeka groggily woke up and immediately knew where she was. She turned 
her head and saw Tenchi and Ryoko floating  
naked in the stasis tubes, seemingly sleeping. For a moment, Ayeka was 
happy, as she knew that if they were in Washu's  
lab, they would be OK.  
Then she remembered what had put the two she loved there. She started 
wailing again, and then she searched for something.  
She finally found it. A laser scalpel. She opened her upper kimono to 
expose her upper chest and  
she slowly aimed the laser over her heart.  
Just before she was to plunge the scalpel into her heart. It 
disappeared.  
"Now, now, I can't allow my daughter-in-law to hurt herself, now can 
I?" said Washu  
with Yousho now standing beside her. 
"I ...tried to ...kill them Washu! YOU SHOULD KILL ME!!" screamed a 
distraught and sobbing Ayeka. 
"Just like I told Ryoko before, you did not kill them! They alive as 
you can see, and yes they're hurt,  
but you didn't to it. This Lord Garyu did, by controlling you, and he 
tried to kill them, not you. Remember that! 
"But, but, ... my hands ... were full of ... their blood!" said a 
crying Ayeka. 
"As was Ryoko's when she attacked Jurai, and almost killed Sasami! 
Right!" 
"That was different," said Ayeka 
"How different? How Ayeka is that different. Kagato controlled my 
daughter while Jurai burned under her hands.  
She told you she could do nothing about it. Right?" Ayeka thought about 
what Washu said. She slowly calmed down.  
Shenow was in her brother's arms as Washu then summoned some tea for 
them to sip.  
It calmed her some more, where she then started asking about Tenchi and 
Ryoko's condition.  
Washu went into the same detail as she did during dinner on their 
physical, and psychological therapy. 
"So we all will have to go through this psychotherapy together?" asked 
Ayeka. 
"Mainly you and Ryoko, since you both need to work through these 
similar experiences.  
Tenchi mainly will be the one who has the physical therapy since his 
nervous system needs to rebuild itself." 
"Can I stay here and wait for them to wake up Miss Washu?" 
"Look, Ayeka, I forgive you. So please call me Mom, and I'm sure those 
two will forgive you too.  
Remember you told them of your premonitions, so they'll be much more 
understanding. Plus they do love you." 
"Even after what I.." Washu waggled her finger at her." What Garyu made 
me do?" Ayeka nodded a yes. 
"Good, your progressing even now, excellent." 
After a minute, Ayeka hesitantly asks; "Wa .... Mom, did the attack 
affect Ryoko's Baby?" 
"I don't know Ayeka, We'll run the tests Saturday and see." 
"I won't be able to forgive myself if her baby ..." 
Ayeka was stopped when Yousho said; " You cannot be blamed here,  
so don't think about it until then sister, please." 
"All right brother, I'll do that." Then turning to Washu. "I'm tired, 
can I sleep on the bed there, please?" 
"Not a problem, Get some sleep because I don't think they'll be up till 
morning." 
"Then I'll sleep till then. Good night Mom, good night Brother." 
"Good night My little Ayeka."  
"Good night sister, and do not worry everything will be better." 
"Thank you both". She then got under the covers and stared at the two 
figures floating in the stasis tubes.  
"Good night my loves, please forgive me!" She blew them both a kiss, 
and said some prayers to Tsunami. 
Wow a real change of pace huh folks! Well, we will see Ryoko and Tenchi 
up next chapter and they and the rest of  
the family will have to deal with the aftermath of the battle and get 
ready as well for the coming events and the royals in  
Chapter #8 Thank Goddess it's Friday!
