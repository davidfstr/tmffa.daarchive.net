Washu enters scene dressed in her pajamas.  She holds a piece of paper in
her hand.

Washu sighs deeply and knocks on the door.

After no answer Washu knocks again louder.

TENCHI (O. C.)
What?  Who is it?

WASHU
It's Washu, Tenchi.

TENCHI (O. C.)
One moment.

The door opens.

TENCHI
It's 2:30 Little Washu.

WASHU
Are you alone?  May I come in?

TENCHI
Alone?  Of course I'm alone!

Tenchi looks at Washu's face carefully.

TENCHI
Come in, Little Washu.  What is wrong?

Washu enters the room and closes the door.

INT. Tenchi's room - NIGHT

Washu moves over and sits on the bed.  

Tenchi follows and kneels on the floor beside her.

TENCHI
What is it Little Washu?

WASHU
It's no Christmas present.

Washu hands Tenchi the paper.

Tenchi reads the paper and stands up dropping the paper.  His face is
filled with anguish.

TENCHI
Nooooooooooo!!!

Washu stands and wraps her arms around Tenchi in a tight hug.

Tenchi is sobbing.

Hear the sound of pounding on the door.  The voices of Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami
can be heard shouting concern for Tenchi.

WASHU
Come in!

The door opens and the girls spill into the room.  All three girls are
dressed in their pajamas.

AYEKA
What are you doing Ms. Washu?

RYOKO
Get your hands off of him!

WASHU
Sit down and be quiet!

The other three girl's eyes go wide.

They move to the bed to sit while Washu guides Tenchi to his desk chair.

Sasami sees the paper on the floor and moves toward it.

WASHU
Leave it Sasami!  You three stay quiet!

Washu sits Tenchi down at his desk.

The other three sit on the bed.

Knock at the door.

WASHU
Come in Mihoshi.

Mihoshi enters in uniform with gun in hand.

MIHOSHI
I heard trouble.

She looks at Tenchi and moves next to him.

MIHOSHI
Serious trouble.

She scans the room and quickly bends down to take the paper.

Washu holds her arm before she can read it.

Ayeka and Ryoko take in a breath.

Washu glares at them.

Both shut their mouths.

WASHU
Lord Tenchi.  Lord Tenchi you must lead us.

Tenchi drops his head into folded arms on his desk.

Mihoshi lays her gun hand on Tenchi's shoulder.

MIHOSHI
Tenchi, I am here for you. We haven't lost yet!

Tenchi lifts his head.

TENCHI
Yes, Mihoshi, I can still fight him.  Will you help me, Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
To the end of the universe, Tenchi.

Tenchi stands, his face filled with grief.

He hugs Mihoshi and takes the paper from her.

TENCHI
Thank you for bringing the news right away Little Washu.

Tenchi hugs Washu.

Tenchi moves over to the bed and kneels down in front of Ayeka.

He hands her the paper.  

Both Ryoko and Sasami read it over her shoulders.

INT. Close up of paper - NIGHT

	From:	Azusa, Emperor of Jurai
	To:	Tenchi
	NO

INT. Tenchi's room - NIGHT

Ayeka, crying, clutches at Tenchi.

Ryoko and Sasami hug them both.

Washu and Mihoshi move and place a hand on Tenchi's back.

TENCHI
I refuse his answer!

Tenchi stands siting Ayeka back down on the bed.

He moves between Washu and Mihoshi to his desk.

He takes out a small box and returns to kneeling in front of Ayeka.

Tenchi opens the box and show the ring to Ayeka.

TENCHI
Ayeka, will you marry me?

AYEKA
Sasami, from this moment forth you are the Crown Princess of Jurai.

Sasami places her hands over her mouth and shakes her head no.

AYEKA
Yes Lord Tenchi I will marry you.  My heart is filled with joy.

Tenchi kisses Ayeka and places the ring on her finger.

TENCHI
I warned you that you might have to give up many things to marry me.  I am
sorry to have tested you today.  We will get married on Jurai, Ayeka.  Your
father will either stand aside or give us his blessing, this I vow!

Sasami begins crying.

Ayeka and Tenchi hug her close.

SASAMI
Take back your words, Ayeka.  I don't want to be Crown Princess!

AYEKA
The words were spoken and witnessed.  In my heart that can not be changed.

SASAMI
I hate him.  I will hate him forever!

AYEKA
Do not speak of forever, Sasami.  My heart holds no hate for father.  I can
no longer serve the people of Jurai because I have defied the Emperor.  You,
Sasami, can hate father but still serve the people.

SASAMI
I don't care!

TENCHI
We must always care, Sasami, or else we'll lose hope.

SASAMI
I don't care!

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Mihoshi, and Washu gather around Sasami and hug her.

ACT ONE

FADE IN:

INT. Tenchi's room early morning - DAY (Wednesday, 11 December 1996)

Ayeka and Sasami are asleep in Tenchi's bed.  Ayeka holds Sasami in her arms.

Mihoshi is siting on the floor leaning against the bed, asleep, still holding
her gun.  

Washu sits at Tenchi's desk typing on her holographic keyboard.

Ryoko is curled up on the floor, awake, watching Tenchi.

Tenchi stands at his window watching the sunrise.

WASHU
What now, Lord Tenchi? 

TENCHI
I was waiting for Azusa's answer before finalizing the wedding plans.  No need
to change that now.

Ryoko stands and walks over to Tenchi.

She wraps her arms around him.

RYOKO
I love you Tenchi.

WASHU
When?

TENCHI
Let's wake everyone for breakfast.  We will discuss it together.

INT. Dining room table - DAY

Tenchi, Ryoko, and Sasami are in their usual place.  Ayeka sits next to the
brooding Sasami holding her.  You can here Mihoshi and Washu in the kitchen.
Ryo-Ohki sits in Sasami's lap.

Washu and Mihoshi walk out and serve breakfast.

Washu sits next to Ayeka and Mihoshi sits next to Tenchi.

TENCHI
First we must graduate High School.  The following week I will wed Ryoko.
Then we will take Mihoshi's ship to Jurai.

RYOKO
Why not take Ryo-Ohki?

RYO-OHKI
Meow.

TENCHI
I want to keep Ryo-Ohki in reserve.

MIHOSHI
I don't have any staterooms on my ship.

TENCHI
You do have a large cargo hold.

MIHOSHI
Yes.

TENCHI
Fine.  We will take this house.

WASHU
That would simplify matters.  My portal is already built into the house.

AYEKA
Where will your wedding with Ryoko be?

TENCHI
We will have the wedding at the temple and reception here at the house.

RYOKO
Reception?

TENCHI
I know there isn't many people for you to invite.  I though we would invite a
few friends and teachers from school.

RYOKO
I would like Ryoe as a bride's maid.  I would like you, Ayeka, as a bride's maid
also.

AYEKA
Yes, I will do that.

RYOKO
Sasami, will you walk in front of me and drop flower petals?

SASAMI
Okay.

AYEKA
Who will be your best men?

TENCHI
Kazuhiko and Daijiro.

RYOKO
Washu...  Mom, I would like Grandfather to walk me down the aisle.

WASHU
Okay.

TENCHI
I will work with dad to set up the reception.

RYOKO
Tenchi, can I wear your mother's kimono for a wedding dress?

TENCHI
I would like that Ryoko.

MIHOSHI
Where are you going for your honeymoon?

Tenchi looks into Ryoko's eyes.

TENCHI
I am afraid our honeymoon will be aboard your ship Mihoshi as we head for
Jurai.

AYEKA
I do not have to marry you on Jurai, Lord Tenchi.

Tenchi looks into Ayeka's eyes.

TENCHI
Only if you command me to not marry you on Jurai, my Princess.

Ayeka looks down in her lap.

SASAMI
I am scared Tenchi.

TENCHI
So am I, Sasami.  But we will be together.

MIHOSHI
Are we all going to Jurai?

TENCHI
I am hoping Grandfather will go.  I know Father can not.  He has to many
contracts to take the year or more we will be gone.  Of course everyone here
can go.

SASAMI
Something terrible will happen if we go to Jurai.

TENCHI
True.  I think the same will happen if we stay here.

SASAMI
That is why I am afraid.

WASHU
So our real choice is to stay on the defense or go on the offence.

TENCHI
That's how I see it Mom.

Washu's face breaks out in a big smile.

WASHU
Oh, Tenchi!

RYOKO
Then I say go on the offence, and kick butt!

AYEKA
Well put as always, Ryoko.

RYOKO
Hey, what does that mean?

TENCHI
Save it for the enemy, girls.

MIHOSHI
When will you publicly announce the wedding?

TENCHI
Sometime after midterms, or maybe as late as April.

Sasami whimpers.

SASAMI
Wait as long as you can.  Something terrible will happen when she finds out.

Tenchi moves over to kneel beside Sasami.

TENCHI
Who finds out Sasami?

SASAMI
The lady in my dreams.  She doesn't like you Tenchi.

TENCHI
What did I do to her?

SASAMI
You scare her, Tenchi.  And she scares me.

Tenchi holds Sasami close.

TENCHI
Don't fear Little Sasami.  I am here with you.

WASHU
Can you name her Sasami?

Sasami shakes her head no.

WASHU
Maybe Tsunami can help us.

TENCHI
No Little Washu, I won't force it out of her, and I won't let you do it
either.

WASHU
It may be the answer that saves us Tenchi.

TENCHI
I will lose it all before I give up on one of you.  I won't destroy Sasami
to save the rest.

SASAMI
I want to help Tenchi.

TENCHI
You are helping Sasami.  Listen to your dreams.

SASAMI
Okay Tenchi.

EXT. Stairs - DAY

Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko walk down the stairs toward the school bus stop.

AYEKA
I am worried about Sasami.

TENCHI
She'll bounce back.

AYEKA
What if Washu does something to her?

TENCHI
I don't think Washu will do anything to hurt Sasami.

They walk along in silence.

A sly look crosses Ryoko's face.

RYOKO
You ready to get waxed in volleyball practice, Ayeka?

AYEKA
How can you joke about things at a time like this?

Ryoko pouts.

TENCHI
You should know by now Ayeka.  If Ryoko doesn't joke about things she will
start to cry.

RYOKO
I will not!

Tenchi chuckles at the thought.

TENCHI
Have it your way.

They walk on with Ryoko in a huff and Ayeka downcast.

They wait for the bus at the bus stop.

TENCHI
I am sorry.  I can't stand you two mad at me all day.

AYEKA
I am just worried about our future.

Ryoko takes Tenchi's hand.

RYOKO
I forgive you, Tenchi, and I'm sorry, Ayeka.

Ayeka giggles.

AYEKA
That's okay.  Besides I think I will wax you in volleyball.

RYOKO
In your dreams, Princess, in your dreams.

Ayeka looks at the ground.

AYEKA
My dreams are all I have left.

Tenchi hugs Ayeka, and Ryoko hugs them both.

The bus pulls up and all three get on.

INT. Washu's laboratory - DAY

Washu is working at her keyboard.

We hear the crab door alarm.

WASHU
Who is it?

SASAMI (O. C.)
It's me.

Washu turns around in her seat.

INT. Close up of Washu and Sasami - DAY

Washu is sitting on her cushion Sasami stands by the door.  The door
fades away.

WASHU
Hello Sasami, can I help you?

Sasami looks at the ground and shuffles her feet.

Washu walks over to Sasami and kneels down before her.

SASAMI
I want to help.

WASHU
I promised Tenchi not to do anything to you.

SASAMI
I didn't promise him.

Washu hugs Sasami.

WASHU
You don't have to do this Little Sasami.

SASAMI
I'm scared Ms. Washu.

WASHU
We will be all right as long as Tenchi is with us.

SASAMI
The lady wants to take Tenchi away!

Sasami starts crying.

Washu wipes away Sasami's tears.

WASHU
It's okay Sasami.  Let's go visit Ryo-Oh.

A portal appears and Washu holding Sasami's hand walks through.

INT. Ryo-Oh's pod - DAY

Ryo-Oh is about four feet tall.

SASAMI
Ryo-Oh is looking very nice.

Light beams come from Ryo-Oh's leaves.  None are able to reach the water.

WASHU
In about nine years she will be ready to evolve into a tree ship.

SASAMI
Do you miss your son, Ms. Washu?

Washu closes her eyes in grief.

WASHU
Very much Sasami.

SASAMI
Do you know where he is?

WASHU
No, when I lost him, I gave him my love and his freedom.

SASAMI
Do you think Tsunami might know?

WASHU
I won't ask her if she did.

Sasami starts crying again.

SASAMI
Why must I become Tsunami?  I want to stay myself.

Washu holds Sasami close.

WASHU
You know that the MASS is inside Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki.

SASAMI
Yes.

WASHU
Do you think that Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki will turn into the MASS?

Sasami stops crying.

SASAMI
No.

WASHU
Well Tsunami is inside of you.  That does not mean you will turn into
Tsunami any more than Ryoko and Ryo-Ohki will turn into the MASS.

SASAMI
But I saw her reflection!

Washu moves Sasami over to the pool's edge.

WASHU
Look now and tell me who you see?

SASAMI
I see myself now, but what about the time at the spa?

Washu kneels in front of Sasami.

WASHU
You were scared then too, Sasami.  Scared that Tenchi and Ayeka wouldn't
like you anymore when they found out.

SASAMI
We all saw her where my reflection should have been.

WASHU
Ryo-Ohki assimilated the MASS when it attacked Tenchi.  She did this to defend
Tenchi.  You are a very powerful little girl.  When you were threatened by
death, you assimilated Tsunami, to defend yourself.

SASAMI
But why does my reflection look like Tsunami?

WASHU
I will let you in on a secret.  That is not what Tsunami looks like.  It is
what you will look like when you grow up.

SASAMI
It is?

WASHU
Yes, it is.

SASAMI
Okay, then why did we see my future reflection?

WASHU
Your life reached a crisis.  You could no longer keep the secret.  The part in
you that is Tsunami wanted you to let out the secret.  She changed your
refection to your future self.

SASAMI
Tsunami can make me do things?

WASHU
Tsunami, the Life Tree, could make you do things.  Tsunami that is in you can't
make you do things, but she can help you do things.  Especially when it is
very important.  It's like Tenchi.  He can't generate the Light Hawk Wings
unless someone he loves is in danger.  The Light Hawk Wings can not make
Tenchi do anything.

SASAMI
Thank you Ms. Washu.  I think I understand now.

WASHU
Let's go back now.  I still have a lot of work to do.

SASAMI
I still want to help, and I am not as scared anymore.

WASHU
Are you sure Sasami?  Tenchi won't like it.

SASAMI
Yes, I have to do something.

Washu stands and pulls a pillow out of a hole in the air.

She sets the pillow by the water and it floats there.

WASHU
Sit on the pillow Sasami.

Sasami sits on the floating pillow.

WASHU
Stare into the water Sasami.  Think about helping Tenchi.  You are getting 
very sleepy.

Sasami's head drops to her chest.  Washu watches the water.

Sasami's reflection wavers and reforms into Tsunami.

Ryo-Oh shoots hundreds of light beams from its leaves.

Tsunami appears above her reflection.

TSUNAMI
Why did you tell her she does not look like me?

WASHU
I spoke the truth.  She will grow up to look like she should.  I would ask why
do you choose to look like Sasami's future self.

TSUNAMI
That is an excellent, good question.

Tsunami laughs.

TSUNAMI
I am here because Sasami wished me here.  What do you want to know Washu?

WASHU
Is the lady in Sasami's dreams Tokimi?

TSUNAMI
How did you learn of that name?

WASHU
Tokimi made a mistake meeting with Dr. Clay and Zero.  I found out about
her before she could wipe their memories.  Zero did not believe she could
exist.

TSUNAMI
Do you believe that science can answer everything?

WASHU
I am not Dr. Clay.  It is the mystery of life I search for, knowing I will
never find it.

TSUNAMI
What if you do find it?

WASHU
Then I will be able to rest at last.  20,000 years is a long time to
be searching.

TSUNAMI
Do you regret the years, Washu?

WASHU
No, they brought me Ryoko and Tenchi.  It was well worth the wait.

TSUNAMI
They also brought you a son.

WASHU
We will not speak of my son.  He has his own future, and I will not meddle
in it.  Back to my question, is Tokimi in Sasami's dreams?

TSUNAMI
Yes.

WASHU
Are you the reason Sasami can dream of Tokimi?

TSUNAMI
Yes.

WASHU
Who or what is Tokimi?

TSUNAMI
Little Washu, there are things I can not speak of.

WASHU
Don't try to butter me up.  Can't or won't?

Tsunami sighs deeply.

TSUNAMI
She is my sister.

WASHU
What?  Tokimi is a Life Tree?  She can't be a Life Tree and your sister.
You were the first Life Tree.  All the others come from you.

TSUNAMI
Have I always been a Life Tree, Washu?

WASHU
You have been around as long as I can remember.  I studied at Jurai when it
was a backwater planet.

TSUNAMI
How far back can you remember, Washu?  Do you remember your mother and
father?  Do you remember your childhood?

WASHU
No.

TSUNAMI
How old is the universe, Washu?

WASHU
Several billion years.

TSUNAMI
Yet you can only remember back 20,000 years.

WASHU
How long have you known me Tsunami?

TSUNAMI
I have always known you, Washu.

WASHU
So, Tokimi has also always known me.

TSUNAMI
Yes.

WASHU
Why do you two have any interest in me?

TSUNAMI
I have always loved you, Washu.

WASHU
And Tokimi?

TSUNAMI
You scare her.  Now Tenchi scares her even more.

WASHU
Who am I to scare someone like you?

TSUNAMI
More than you can imagine.

WASHU
Will you tell me?

TSUNAMI
No, I won't tell you your past.

WASHU
Why would Tenchi scare someone like you?

TSUNAMI
It is not so much as Tenchi, but what may come from him.

WASHU
A child from me, my creation, or you.

TSUNAMI
Sometimes you see to deeply Washu.

WASHU
Will Sasami's dreams come true, or can we still change the future?

TSUNAMI
Sasami's dreams are a warning, not prophecy, they have not yet been
written in time.

WASHU
You have given me much to think about, Tsunami.

TSUNAMI
Take care, Little Washu.  The universe won't be the same without you.

Tsunami fades from view.  The reflection wavers and returns to Sasami's.

Washu takes Sasami in her arms and steps through a portal to Sasami's
bedroom.

She puts Sasami in bed and gives her a kiss.

Washu steps back through the portal.

EXT. Bus stop at Tenchi's house - DAY

Washu dressed in her academy uniform waits at the bus stop.

The bus pulls up and Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko get off.

TENCHI
Hello, Little Washu.

WASHU
Hello, Tenchi.  How did your day go?

RYOKO
Look at this.

Ryoko pulls out a packet of papers and hands them to Washu.

RYOKO
Mr. Azaka wants me to check out his latest theory on space travel.

Washu hands back the packet.

WASHU
Leave it in the lab and I will take a look at it.  Why don't you two run
along while I walk with Tenchi?

AYEKA
This has something to do with Sasami, doesn't it?

WASHU
Please, Ayeka, we will talk more over dinner.

Tenchi first looks at Ayeka and then at Washu.

TENCHI
It's okay Ayeka.  I see you both a little later.

Ryoko frowns and takes Ayeka's arm.

RYOKO
Let's go Princess.

Ayeka looking worried goes with Ryoko.

TENCHI
What happened Little Washu?

WASHU
Sasami came into my lab today.  She asked me to find a way to help you.

TENCHI
I told you not to touch her!

WASHU
I told her the same thing.  She said she did not make any promises to you.

TENCHI
Is she okay?

WASHU
Much better than before.  She is making a big dinner right now.

TENCHI
What did you do?

WASHU
Let's walk and talk.

Washu and Tenchi move along the path.

INT. Dining room table - NIGHT

Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, and Washu sit in their usual places
for dinner.

The meal has just been served.

WASHU
Sasami let me talk to Tsunami today.

AYEKA
Are you okay, Sasami?

SASAMI
I am feeling better now than I have in days.  My dream no longer frightens me.

AYEKA
That is good news.  What has changed about your dream?

SASAMI
Nothing.  I just know now that my dream does not have to come true.

TENCHI
We can change what happens in your dreams?

WASHU
That's right.  Tsunami herself said that the dreams are a reflection of the
lady's desire.  Not a prediction of the future.

MIHOSHI
Who is this lady in Sasami's dreams?

WASHU
I'm not going to tell you.

RYOKO
Why not!  She is threatening Tenchi!

WASHU
Because Mihoshi will put it in her report to Galactic Police Headquarters.

MIHOSHI
I could promise not...

WASHU (overlapping)
Don't make a promise you can't keep Mihoshi.  You are to good a detective to
leave anything out of your reports.

Mihoshi starts to cry.

MIHOSHI
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to do my job.

TENCHI
It's okay Mihoshi.  You are doing a great job for the police.

AYEKA
So if we have Mihoshi leave we...

WASHU (overlapping)
Without Mihoshi we won't have a chance.  I gave a lot to Jurai to have
Mihoshi back.  No, I will tell you the name when we need to know and then
it won't matter what goes in Mihoshi's report.

AYEKA
You wanted Mihoshi back?

Mihoshi stops crying and starts smiling.

MIHOSHI
Ms. Washu, that is so kind of you.

WASHU
Hey, take it easy.  I did it for Tenchi, okay?

TENCHI
So explain what Tsunami said?

WASHU
The lady had been tracking me for thousands of years.  She tried to get me
with Dr. Clay last year.  The bad news is she found out about you Tenchi.
She also found out a part of Tsunami is in Sasami.

RYOKO
What is the bad news!

WASHU
The lady is afraid of Tenchi's children, afraid of a child with me, more
afraid of a child with Ryoko.  Deathly afraid of a child with Sasami.

AYEKA
Ms. Washu how can you say that in front of Sasami.

Sasami blushes.

SASAMI
I already knew Ayeka.

TENCHI
I don't think that last part is going to happen anyway.

Sasami bats her eyes as her blush deepens.

SASAMI
Are you sure Tenchi?

Tenchi's jaw drops and he turns red.

WASHU
Who knows what the future may bring?

AYEKA
She doesn't care if I have Tenchi's child.

Tenchi falls over.

RYOKO
That's not fair.  I want Tenchi's child.

Tenchi tries to crawl out of the room.

WASHU
Don't you sneak off my little guinea pig.

TENCHI
At least change the subject.

Tenchi sits back up.

AYEKA
What did you think would happen after we were married?

RYOKO
Yeah, I want some of that serious lovin'.

AYEKA
It would be safer for me to have his children.

RYOKO
Listen here little Princess.  Just let that lady try to lay a finger on
my child.

SASAMI
Well I don't care who has the first child.  I just want to be an auntie.

RYOKO
Well as first wife I will have first crack at it.

AYEKA
Not in front of Sasami!

RYOKO
I think little Sasami knows more than she is letting on.  Hey, Sasami.

Sasami's is now as red as Tenchi.

TENCHI
Ryoko, we will be on Mihoshi's starship!

RYOKO
And?

Tenchi looks down in his lap and shakes his head.

WASHU
Sasami is right about one thing.  The sooner you announce the wedding the
sooner you will force the lady's hand.

TENCHI
Fine.  We will make the announcement two weeks before the end of school,
three weeks before the wedding.

WASHU
Good, that's settled.  Now we just have to keep an eye out for any preemptive
strike against us.

TENCHI
Let's finish this fine meal Sasami made for us.  It is good to have you
cooking again Sasami.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Kazuhiko, Daijiro, and Ryoe wait outside the school.

Father's van pulls up to the curb and all climb aboard.

Ryoe, Ryoko, and Ayeka sit behind Father.  Kazuhiko and Daijiro sit in the
back.  Tenchi sits next to Father.

DAIJIRO
Good afternoon Mr. Masaki.

FATHER
Please call me Father, everyone else does.

RYOE
Good afternoon Father.

FATHER
My, my, yet another pretty girl in our house.

TENCHI
Father!

Father chuckles to himself.

FATHER
I see she is well chaperoned.  Hello Kazuhiko, it has been some time since
you last came to visit.

KAZUHIKO
Almost two years.  It was before you moved to the country.

FATHER
And you must be Ryoe and Daijiro.

Ryoe smiles.

DAIJIRO
Yes, thank you for letting us come to visit.

FATHER
Well, let's get going.  Sasami will be disappointed if we are late for her
dinner.

DAIJIRO
Who's Sasami?

AYEKA
She is my younger sister.

RYOE
Your younger sister does the cooking?

Ryoko obviously winks at Ayeka.

RYOKO
Sasami is a gifted cook.

Ayeka sniffs.

The van drives off out of the scene.

EXT. Front of house - DAY

Standing on the front porch is Mihoshi, Washu, and Sasami.  Sasami holds
a tray.

The van pulls up to the house and everyone gets out.

They walk over and stand in front of the welcoming committee.

MIHOSHI
We wish to welcome you to the Masaki home.

SASAMI
Here are some warm towels to refresh yourselves.

Each takes a towel.

RYOKO
I could get used to this.

RYOE
Thank you.

DAIJIRO and KAZUHIKO
Thank you.

Sasami collects the towels.

WASHU
Please come inside and enjoy some tea before supper.

Everyone enters the house.

INT. Family room - DAY

A Christmas tree stands in one corner.

Grandfather sits pouring tea as everyone enters the room.

RYOE
This is a beautiful house Father.

FATHER
Thank you Ryoe.  I designed it with my wife.  We built it together.  It
brings me many happy memories.

DAIJIRO
You design houses?

FATHER
I am an architect.  I don't do many houses anymore, now it's mostly office
buildings.

Grandfather looks at Tenchi.

TENCHI
Forgive me, I have been a terrible host.  Please sit and enjoy tea while I
make introductions.

Everyone but Tenchi sits and takes tea.

TENCHI
This is my Grandfather.  He is in charge of the shrine and head of the
Masaki clan.

GRANDFATHER
I welcome you here.  Tomorrow, if you wish, we can visit the Temple and
Shrine.

DAIJIRO
That would be nice.

TENCHI
This is my Father. He designed this house when he was still in high school.

RYOE
May we see the house?  It is very beautiful.

FATHER
Of course.  Tenchi there is time for a tour before supper.

Sasami stands up.

TENCHI
This is Sasami, Ayeka's younger sister.

SASAMI
I am sorry to leave so soon but I must check on supper.

Sasami leaves the room.

RYOE
She seems so young to be doing the cooking.

FATHER
Sasami is young, but she is Queen of the Kitchen.

TENCHI
This is Mihoshi.

Daijiro is surprised.

DAIJIRO
You are a police officer.

MIHOSHI
Why, yes I am.  I have been sent here to patrol...

Tenchi squeezes Mihoshi's shoulder.

MIHOSHI
... the area and keep the peace.

RYOE
I heard you had a partner.

Mihoshi becomes misty eyed.

MIHOSHI
Yes, Kiyone, she was sent to work at Headquarters.  I do miss her.  We would
sing karaoke together.

TENCHI
This is Little Washu.

WASHU
Hello everyone.

DAIJIRO
Everyone lives here in this house?

TENCHI
Well, yeah, everyone except Grandfather.  He lives at the temple.

KAZUHIKO
That must make for some interesting times Tenchi.

Ryoko, Ayeka, Mihoshi, and Washu start to laugh.

TENCHI
You just might say that Kazuhiko, you just might.

Everyone finishes their tea.

RYOE
Can we see the house now?

TENCHI
Okay, we will start at the top.

INT. Follow group as they move around the house - DAY

TENCHI
This is my Father's room, the master bedroom.

RYOE
It is beautiful.

TENCHI
My Father would design and build and my Mother would decorate.

TENCHI
This is the library.

TENCHI
This is Father's drafting room.  Here is his next project in Tokyo.

DAIJIRO
He does do impressive work.

TENCHI
This is my room.  Daijiro and Kazuhiko will stay here with me.

TENCHI
Here is the bathroom.

TENCHI
This door is Mihoshi's room.

RYOE
Can we take a look Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Well it is a bit of a mess but okay.

Except for the snack food containers, Mihoshi's room is quiet neat.

She has a lot of Galaxy Police paraphernalia on the walls and on stands.

KAZUHIKO
Those are wonderful space photos Mihoshi.

DAIJIRO
You have a lot of neat stuff.

Mihoshi blushes.

MIHOSHI
You are all too kind.

TENCHI
This is Ayeka and Sasami's room.

AYEKA
Please go in.

The room is decorated in very simple taste.

AYEKA
You will be staying here Ryoe.

TENCHI
Hello Grandfather, Father.  This is the family room.  Afternoon tea and
Soap operas is this room's main function.

All the girls share a laugh at that.

TENCHI
Here is the dining room.

TENCHI
Hello Sasami, just running the tour through.  This is the kitchen.

RYOE
Wow!  This is bigger than my house.

TENCHI
And this is the main floor bathroom.

RYOE
Where do you sleep Ryoko?

RYOKO
Well I like to be a little different.

DAIJIRO
Oh, how's that.  You don't sleep.

Ayeka covers her mouth to stifle a laugh.

Ryoko sniffs.

RYOKO
Just look up.

All three guests look at the ceiling.

KAZUHIKO
Is that a pillow on the beam?

RYOKO
Yep, you have found my bed.

DAIJIRO
You sleep on that narrow beam?

RYOKO
I like my space and my privacy.

RYOE
What about you...

Washu point to her door.

WASHU (overlapping)
My room is under the stairs.

RYOE
In the storage closet?

Washu nods her head.

RYOE
I don't understand.

Washu gives her an understanding look.

WASHU
That's okay, you aren't meant to understand.

Tenchi forces a laugh.

TENCHI
Let's go outside and look around the house.

The group exits the through front door.

EXT. Front of house - DAY

Group exits the front door and moves around the outside of house.

TENCHI
Here is the storage shed.  Over there is the bathhouse.

Tenchi walks on leaving his group behind.

KAZUHIKO
Tenchi, why is your bathhouse floating over the lake?

Tenchi stops, stunned, and turns around.

Kazuhiko, Daijiro, and Ryoe are staring at the bathhouse.  The rest
look innocent.

TENCHI
Well that is a little hard to explain.

WASHU
If you think that is hard to explain, you should take them to my room.

TENCHI
I don't think we are ready for your room, Little Washu.

SASAMI (O. C.)
Supper time!

TENCHI
Saved by the bell.  Please let's go in and eat.  Tomorrow we can
explore further.

INT. Dining room table - DAY

Everyone sits in their usual place.  Kazuhiko sits on Ayeka's left.  Ryoe
on Ryoko's right.  And Daijiro sits between Mihoshi and Washu.

FATHER
This is very nice.  It has been a long time since we have had company over.

Everyone starts eating.

DAIJIRO
You made this Sasami?

Sasami blushes.

DAIJIRO
Let me know if you open a restaurant.  I will move in and do anything you want.

SASAMI
You are as silly as Tenchi.

Daijiro bows.

DAIJIRO
I am honored by such a high complement.

RYOE
Daijiro is right, this food is better than good.

The meal winds down.

KAZUHIKO
There is nothing you can do now Tenchi that would surprise me.   Still,
I feel that there is something very unusual going on around here.

DAIJIRO
Yes, it is like a mystery begging to be solved.

RYOE
What precinct do you work out of Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Why this one, of course.

RYOE
How do you sleep on that beam without falling off Ryoko?

RYOKO
I sleep very soundly.

AYEKA
That's the truth.

RYOKO
Hey, what's that suppose to mean.

AYEKA
Oh nothing, nothing at all.

TENCHI
Well you should consider yourselves officially welcomed now.  These
two don't fight in front of just anybody.

Ayeka and Ryoko turn their heads away from Tenchi and sniff.

GRANDFATHER
Yes we must treat you as part of our family now.

TENCHI
Yes, Grandfather I see that now.

WASHU
Well then tomorrow we will start the day with a good soak in the bathhouse.
After that you can look at my room.

MIHOSHI
Oh wow.  If we do that can I show them my police cruiser?

TENCHI
We might as well go all the way.

RYOKO
Are you sure, Tenchi?

AYEKA
I would advise some caution, Tenchi.

TENCHI
We will see what tomorrow brings.

RYOE
You have really peaked my interest now.

DAIJIRO
I defiantly want to know everything.

WASHU
Well I will see you all early tomorrow for the bath.  I still have a lot of
work to do so good night.

RYOE
It must be the fresh air and the excitement, because I am ready to turn in
also.

Sasami and Mihoshi start clearing the dishes.

AYEKA
I will escort you to the room Ryoe.

Ryoe and Ayeka leave.

RYOKO
I can see this is turning into a guy thing.

Ryoko kisses Tenchi on the cheek.

RYOKO
Good night everybody.

Mihoshi and Sasami finish and leave the room.

GRANDFATHER
Nobuyuki, bring out the plum wine.

FATHER
Okay dad.

Father gets the wine from the cabinet and pours glasses for each.

GRANDFATHER
What will you gentlemen be doing after graduation?

KAZUHIKO
I have applied to a college in America.  I want to continue my wresting
career.

DAIJIRO
I have been accepted to Tokyo University.

GRANDFATHER
Have you ever thought about doing some traveling before going back to
school?

DAIJIRO
Like Tenchi.  I don't know if I can afford to take a year off.

GRANDFATHER
What if someone else paid the expenses?

KAZUHIKO
That is too much like a dream coming true.

GRANDFATHER
Do you think Ryoe would go with you Daijiro?

Daijiro is surprised by Grandfather's question.

DAIJIRO
Well she would either go with me or I would stay with her.  It is hard to
say right now.

GRANDFATHER
Hmmm.  I see.

TENCHI
Where are you going with this Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
When your enemies surround you, you can not have too many friends.

TENCHI
I don't think it is right to put your friends in unnecessary danger.

KAZUHIKO
Don't you think your friends should decide what is unnecessary danger,
Tenchi?

DAIJIRO
Yes, Tenchi.  There is too much happening here to leave us out.

TENCHI
Tomorrow then.  We will see what tomorrow brings.

Everyone stands up and leaves the room.

EXT. Bathhouse entrance - DAY (Saturday, 21 December 1996)

The group stands in front of the bathhouse door.

WASHU
Okay listen up now.  We have a girl's side and a boy's side.

Washu nudges Father with her elbow.

WASHU
And a word of advice to you new comers.  Do not try to sneak over to the
other side.

Everyone enters the bathhouse.

INT. Family room - DAY

Everyone lounges around the table and looking very relaxed.  They are enjoying
a snack.

The TV is turned on showing a children's show.  Only Mihoshi watches the TV.

RYOE
That bathhouse is better than the one's I have been to in Tokyo.

WASHU
Why thank you for the complement.

Ryoe looks questioningly at Washu.

RYOKO
My mom made the bathhouse.

Ryoe, Daijiro, and Kazuhiko all snap their heads looking at Ryoko.

Ryoko nods her head at Washu.

The three turn and look at Washu.

DAIJIRO
You are Ryoko's mother.

WASHU
That's right.  I love my little Ryoko.

RYOE
This must be a joke, you aren't over thirteen.

WASHU
I turned thirteen about 20,000 years ago.

DAIJIRO
The story about Jurai was not a joke, was it?

AYEKA
No, Jurai is very real.  I was the Crown Princess of Jurai.

Ryoe looks at Ryoko.

RYOE
And you really fly star ships?

RYOKO
Ryoko's the name, space pirating my game.

KAZUHIKO
You are a pirate?

Ryoko smiles sweetly.

DAIJIRO
Tenchi, can you explain any of this?

TENCHI
Well it all started the summer of...

INT: Dining room table - NIGHT

Everyone, except Grandfather, sit around the dinner table.

DAIJIRO
I found your story hard to swallow until I saw Washu's lab.

RYOE
And Mihoshi's Galaxy Police ship.

KAZUHIKO
And Ryoko fly through a wall.

RYOKO
See I was a good girl, Tenchi, I didn't blow anything up.

DAIJIRO
Somehow I feel I am waiting for the other shoe to drop.

TENCHI
Let's leave it like it is until graduation.

RYOE
It's about the trip you are taking, isn't it?

Kazuhiko stands.

KAZUHIKO
You're leaving the Earth, Tenchi!

DAIJIRO
Yes, that must be it.  That's what your Grandfather was talking about.  Are
you going to invite us?

TENCHI
I can't tell you yet if you can go.  I am not sure that we will go.  There
is still to many things that can change.

Kazuhiko sits back down.

KAZUHIKO
You can count me in Tenchi.

Ryoe looks at Daijiro.

Daijiro nods his head.

RYOE
You can count on us to, Tenchi.

EXT. Forest along the lake - DAY (Saturday, 5 April 1997)

Ryoko walks through the woods with a dreamy look.

She watches the cherry blossoms fall from the trees.

INT. Washu's lab - DAY

Ryoko walks in with a large cloth bag.

RYOKO
Can you keep this fresh until summer?

WASHU
That depends on what it is.

Ryoko opens the bag and Washu looks in.

WASHU
I don't see any problem with that.

RYOKO
Thanks mom.

INT. Physics lab at school - DAY (Friday, 30 May 1997)

Tenchi gathers Kazuhiko, Daijiro, Ryoe, Ayeka, and Ryoko before class

TENCHI
Let's have lunch together at the picnic tables.

DAIJIRO
Sure, it's a beautiful day, today.

Ryoe nods her head in agreement.

EXT. Picnic tables under a tree - DAY

The gym is in the background.

The six gather around a picnic table and start eating lunch.

TENCHI
Ryoko and I are getting married in three weeks.

RYOE
That's great news!

Both Kazuhiko and Daijiro clap Tenchi on the shoulders.

KAZUHIKO
That is wonderful Tenchi!

DAIJIRO
Yes indeed!

Ryoe looks at Ayeka.  Ayeka is wearing a small smile.

Ryoe leans close to Ayeka.

RYOE
Oh, Ayeka.  How are you doing?

AYEKA
Pardon?

RYOE
Ryoko told me that she wouldn't let a man get between the two of you.

AYEKA
She did?

Ryoe nods her head.

AYEKA
Well that is true.  This will change nothing that I haven't planned on.

Ryoe smiles a knowing smile.

RYOKO
Ryoe would you be one of my bride's maids?

RYOE
Yes, I would be honored.

RYOKO
Thank you.  Ayeka will be the other, and her sister will be my flower girl.

Tenchi touches Kazuhiko.

TENCHI
I would like for you to be best man, and I would like for you, Daijiro, to
also stand with me.

KAZUHIKO
Of course Tenchi.  If I ever can find the right one you could do the same
for me.

DAIJIRO
I would also be honored to be a part of your wedding.

RYOE
Where will the ceremony be?

TENCHI
At the temple with the reception in the house.

DAIJIRO
Should be great fun.  Where are you two going for your honeymoon?

TENCHI
We're taking a trip.  We will probably be gone for at least a year.

RYOE
A year!  Oh, are we still in on it?

Daijiro chuckles.

DAIJIRO
Yes, the planet won't be the same without you.

AYEKA
It won't be a pleasure cruise.

Kazuhiko, Daijiro, and Ryoe look at Ayeka.

AYEKA
We are going to defy my father.

KAZUHIKO
Your father is the Emperor?

Ayeka nods her head.

DAIJIRO
Why do you want trouble with the Emperor?

Ayeka looks at Tenchi.

TENCHI
He won't allow me to marry his daughter.

Daijiro, Kazuhiko, and Ryoe are all shocked.  They turn and look at Ryoko.

RYOKO
He is a mean old man not letting my close sister marry my future husband.

Daijiro, Kazuhiko, and Ryoe's jaw drop.

KAZUHIKO
You are going to have two wives Tenchi?

TENCHI
Jurai law allows me three.

KAZUHIKO
Tenchi you have to tell me your secret.

RYOE
That is what you meant Ayeka.

Ayeka nods her head.

DAIJIRO
This isn't a game anymore is it?

TENCHI
This is very serious.  Anyone who goes with me will be in danger.

RYOE
You may call it danger, but I call it living.

RYOKO
I do like your style.

DAIJIRO
Ryoe is right.  This does not change my mind about going with you.

RYOE
And I go where my husband goes.

Everyone stops and stares at the two.

DAIJIRO
We were married last summer.

Congratulations from all around.

KAZUHIKO
Well I may be the lone wolf, but you can still count me in.

TENCHI
Thank you all, I do believe I will need all the help I can get.

INT. Dining room table - NIGHT (Wednesday, 4 June 1997)

All the family is present.

The meal has just ended.

GRANDFATHER
Tomorrow is graduation day?

TENCHI
Yes, Grandfather, for all three of us.

GRANDFATHER
Is it all right for me to attend the ceremony?

AYEKA
Yes, Grandfather, it would be a pleasure for you to attend.

RYOKO
All of you can show up.  We can party afterwards.

GRANDFATHER
Well then, Nobuyuki, you had best bring it out now.

FATHER
Okay dad.

Mihoshi and Father exit to the kitchen.

Sasami giggles in her hand.

TENCHI
Bring out what Grandfather?

GRANDFATHER
Just wait and see.

Father comes back in with a large three-layer cake.

On top are small statues of Tenchi, Ayeka, and Ryoko all dressed in
graduation gowns.

The lettering says "Congratulations to the class of '97".

Mihoshi is carrying the plum wine and cups.

AYEKA
That is beautiful.

SASAMI
You cut the cake Tenchi.

Tenchi takes the knife and starts cutting the cake.  Mihoshi passes out
the wine.

RYOKO
My favorite, chocolate!

Tenchi hands cake to everyone.

TENCHI
This is wonderful. Did you make it Sasami?

SASAMI
Yep.  Ms. Washu made the statues and Mihoshi did the frosting.

TENCHI
Thank you everyone.

Tenchi raises his cup.

TENCHI
To new beginnings.

EVERYONE
New beginnings.

Ryoko leans against Tenchi.

RYOKO
This is a perfect day Tenchi.

Ayeka wraps herself around Tenchi's arm.

AYEKA
I wish it could last forever.

TENCHI
Yes, but tomorrow may bring something even better.

EXT. Track field at school - DAY (Thursday, 5 June 1997)

The field is set up for the graduation ceremony.  All the students fill
the front seats.

Tenchi sits separately from Ryoko and Ayeka who sit together.

The Masaki clan sits together near the center isle.

The school principle approaches the podium.

PRINCIPLE
Good morning.  I wish to thank everyone in attendance today as we send the
class of '97 into the world.  I would like to start with opening remarks by
our class president, Daijiro Saionji.

Daijiro moves onto stage and up to the podium.

EXT. Close up of the Masaki clan - DAY

SASAMI
That's our friend!

MIHOSHI
Why yes he is.  I better take a photograph.

WASHU
He didn't mention he was class president.

MIHOSHI
I am going to get closer.  This camera isn't very good.

Mihoshi moves into the center isle and starts toward the front.

DAIJIRO
And now I would like to introduce the valedictorian, Tenchi Masaki

Daijiro moves off stage as Tenchi moves on stage.  They shake hands as
they pass.

FATHER
That is a surprise. Tenchi didn't tell me about this.

GRANDFATHER
You should read the program.

WASHU
My guinea pig just loves making me rewrite my data.

Mihoshi starts jumping up and down as she waves her arms.

She runs to the front to take a photograph.

As Tenchi moves behind the podium, Mihoshi trips and falls, which sends
her camera flying.

The camera is aimed straight at Tenchi's head.

Tenchi ducks his head to avoid the camera when a shot rings out.

The camera explodes when the bullet hits it.

Some people start falling to the ground while others start running.

Tenchi crouches behind the podium.

Mihoshi stares at the remains of her camera and starts to cry.

MIHOSHI
My camera!

A second shot rings out hitting the podium.

EXT. Close up of Ayeka and Ryoko - DAY

Ayeka and Ryoko stand scanning the buildings.

Ayeka brings up her shield.

RYOKO
Where's it coming from?

Another shot is fired striking Ayeka's shield.  The bullet disintegrates
on impact.

Ayeka points.

AYEKA
That building, fourth floor, third window.

RYOKO
I'm on it.

Ryoko disappears.

EXT. Close up of Mihoshi and Tenchi - DAY

Washu enters the scene and stands next to Mihoshi.

WASHU
Stay calm Tenchi.  This is not your fight.

TENCHI
Stay calm!  Someone is shooting at me!

EXT. Building - DAY

Ryoko appears outside the building, out of view of the open window, as
another shot is fired.

She phases through the wall.

INT. Office room - DAY

Yuriko is kneeling with a rifle.

Ryoko passes through the wall to Yuriko's right.

YURIKO
Damn!  How can I be missing that bitch at this range!

RYOKO
Hello, Yuriko.

Yuriko drops his rifle spinning to face Ryoko.

YURIKO
How did you get here!

RYOKO
Say hello to the Devil for me.

Ryoko raises her hand

RYOKO
When you get to hell.

EXT. Building from a distance - DAY

An explosion shatters some windows on the 4th floor of a nearby building.

EXT. Close up of Mihoshi, Tenchi, and Washu - DAY

WASHU
Not anymore.

Tenchi stands up.

Mihoshi is still crying.

WASHU
Well continue with your speech Tenchi.

Washu looks at Mihoshi.

WASHU
Why are you still crying Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
I lost my camera!

WASHU
I am going to regret this.

Washu hands Mihoshi her camera.

WASHU
Here Mihoshi, take this one.

Mihoshi brightens.

MIHOSHI
Oh, thank you very much, Ms. Washu.  Stand up straight Tenchi.  I want a
good photograph of you.

EXT. Close up of Ayeka - DAY

Ryoko, brushing off her clothes, walks up next to Ayeka.

AYEKA
Well?

RYOKO
He won't be bothering anyone anymore.

AYEKA
Who was it?

RYOKO
A mistake we made earlier this year that we failed to erase.

AYEKA
Yuriko?

Ryoko nods her head.

AYEKA
Was it necessary to blow up the building?

RYOKO
I try to do something and all I get is criticism.

Ayeka starts laughing, and Ryoko joins in.

People around them stare in silence.

EXT. Graduation ceremony - DAY

Tenchi stands behind the podium.

TENCHI
Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.  We will continue with the
graduation ceremony.

FADE OUT:

END ACT TWO



ACT THREE

FADE IN:

INT. Large hall - NIGHT

Most of the students are in the hall for the graduation party.

The DJ is working but no one is dancing.

Conversation is quiet.

Tenchi, Ayeka, Ryoko, Washu, Sasami, Ryoe, Daijiro, and Kazuhiko sit around
a table.

RYOKO
This party is dead.

TENCHI
Ryoko, someone shot up the graduation ceremony!

RYOKO
That was a long time ago.  I want to party now.

TENCHI
It was six hours ago!

AYEKA
Lord Tenchi.  Some people relieve their stress in different ways.

TENCHI
Well I am still stressed out!

Mihoshi moves up behind Tenchi and starts rubbing his shoulders.

MIHOSHI
I find this always relieves my stress.

Both Ayeka and Ryoko glare at Mihoshi, but Mihoshi simply smiles.


WASHU
Well no one from school was hurt and it will ensure your class is remembered.

TENCHI
I still want to know what happened?  The police say a gas explosion killed
the...  A gas explosion!

Tenchi stares at Ryoko.

Ryoko looks very innocent.

Tenchi looks at Ayeka.

Ayeka looks very regal.

TENCHI
Start talking you two.

AYEKA
Lord Tenchi, is it not right that the wives should protect their husband?

Ryoko leans on Tenchi and moves her finger over his chest.

RYOKO
Tenchi, do you know how many people I have killed?

Ryoe, Daijiro, and Kazuhiko look on with interest.

TENCHI
I ah... Ah... I never thought about that.

Ryoko starts sniffling.

RYOKO
I wish I could not think about it.

TENCHI
You should try to leave your past behind you.  We will start fresh together.

Ryoko brightens up.

RYOKO
Okay Tenchi, if that is what you wish, I will forget about my past.

TENCHI
That's good Ryoko.  Now what happened today?

RYOKO
I don't know.  I have forgotten all about it.

AYEKA
I can't seem to recall any of the details either.

TENCHI
Fine.  I would thank you two, but I can't remember why.

AYEKA
Tenchi, let's dance.

Tenchi and Ayeka move onto the floor.

RYOE
Don't just sit there; let's join them.

Ryoe and Daijiro move onto the dance floor.  Soon other couples join them.

KAZUHIKO
May I have this dance Ms. Mihoshi?

MIHOSHI
Oh my, thank you, yes.

Mihoshi and Kazuhiko enter the dance floor.

SASAMI
I want to dance also.

WASHU
So do I.  How about you daughter?

Ryoko pouts.

RYOKO
I dance as well as I sing.

SASAMI
That's okay Ryoko.  Tenchi likes your singing so he will like your
dancing to.

Ryoko stands up.

RYOKO
He does.

Washu restrains Ryoko.

WASHU
Wait your turn Ryoko.  I don't want you bouncing Ayeka across the hall.

Ryoko sits back down smiling.

EXT. Temple grounds - DAY (Saturday, 7 June 1997)

Washu walks up to the temple.

She claps her hands twice and rings the bell.

Grandfather opens the door and comes out on the porch.

GRANDFATHER
What do you need Washu?

WASHU
Walk with me Grandfather.

Washu and Grandfather walk down the path in silence.

They turn right down a trial.

Both of them approach Grandfather's Jurai Life Tree.

Grandfather stops at the edge of the pond while Washu crosses over and
lays her and on the tree.

WASHU
We will soon be leaving for Jurai, Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
Yes.

WASHU
What will happen if Tenchi decides to remain on Jurai?

GRANDFATHER
That has not been decided yet.

WASHU
True, but if he does stay, what then?

GRANDFATHER
I will return to continue on the path I have chosen.

Washu turns and leans back against the tree.

Grandfather starts across the stepping stones.

He reaches half way.

WASHU
If Ryoko does not return this tree will die.

Grandfather stops.

GRANDFATHER
I can accept that.  I didn't know it would live this long when I came here
700 years ago.

WASHU
But you do know why it still lives today.

GRANDFATHER
Yes.

Washu moves out to the edge of the pond and looks down.

EXT. Close up of Washu's reflection - DAY

See an image of Washu in her 70's.

WASHU (O. C.)
Yes, I should have thought of this.  Older people get much more respect
than younger people.  They are taken much more seriously than a child is.

Washu laughs.

EXT. Close up of Washu - DAY

Young Washu stands from looking in the pool.

WASHU
But I am much to vain for that.

Washu moves across the stepping stones and wraps her arms around Grandfather.

GRANDFATHER
What do you want Washu?

WASHU
Why, I want you to live of course.  Your grandson is marring my daughter.
I do not want them to worry about their aging relatives.

Washu steps back and takes Grandfather's right hand in her left hand.

She pulls out a small disk with her right hand and places it in 
Grandfather's hand.  

Grandfather looks down at his hand.

EXT. Close up of Grandfather and Washu's hands - DAY

Washu's hand holds grandfather's hand.  In grandfather's hand is a wood
disc made from a Jurai Life Tree.  Three gems are imbedded in the disk.

EXT. Close up of Grandfather and Washu - DAY

GRANDFATHER
How did you get this?

WASHU
I'm not the number one genius scientist in the universe for nothing.

GRANDFATHER
No one understands the making of this. Funaho was quite surprised to see my
tree live.  It wasn't until then she learned the true power of Ryoko's gems.

WASHU
If I can create Ryoko, then it is a small matter to create the gems.

GRANDFATHER
Washu, these gems could destroy entire worlds.  There are those who would
destroy worlds to get them.

WASHU
I only promised not to create another Ryoko.  I said nothing about the gems.
I do not want you to die before your time, like Achika, Grandfather.

Grandfather and Washu look at each other in silence.

EXT. Close up of their hands - DAY

WASHU (O. C.)
If you drop your disguise, I will drop mine.

Grandfather's hand grows young while Washu's hand grows larger.

EXT. Close up of Yoshou and Washu - DAY

Washu in her adult form stands just a little taller than Yoshou.

She moves her face close to Yoshou's face.

WASHU
Where were you 20,000 years ago?

INT. Washu's lab - DAY (Monday, 9 June 1997)

Washu is typing at her holographic keyboard.

Ayeka and Ryoe enter through the stairwell portal.

AYEKA
Ms. Washu could you please...

Washu spins around and raises an evil looking ray gun.

Ryoe dives for the floor.

Washu points the gun at Ayeka.

WASHU
What was that?

AYEKA
Little Washu can you spare me some of your time.

Washu throws the ray gun over her shoulder and it disappears in a hole.

Ryoe stays on the floor.

WASHU
I can always spare time for the Princess of Jurai.

Ayeka holds up one of her royal robes.

AYEKA
Little Washu, could you please duplicate this in Ryoe's size?

WASHU
Sure, no problem.  Just give them to me.

Ayeka hands Washu the robes.

She turns to help Ryoe stand up.

AYEKA
She sometimes gets insistent about being called "Little Washu"; I have found
it best to humor her.

Washu tosses the robes in a hole and types on her keyboard.

Ayeka and Ryoe watch Washu.

WASHU
Oops.

AYEKA
Oops.  What do you mean by oops?

WASHU
I think I tossed your robes in the disintegrater by accident.

Ayeka becomes enraged.

AYEKA
What, are you insane!

Washu moves to Ryoe's side.

WASHU
She is way to uptight to take a joke.

Ayeka's face falls.

Ryoe holds her sides as she bursts with laughter.

RYOE
I don't think you should joke with Ayeka so much.  These are trying times
for her.

WASHU
If she would lighten up a bit.  I might just slow down a little.

A bell rings.  Two robes drop out in Washu's hands.

WASHU
Here you go.  Always the satisfied customer.

AYEKA
Thank you Little Washu.

Ayeka takes Ryoe's arm and heads for the exit.

AYEKA
Let's go before I do something disastrous.

As soon as Ayeka and Ryoe leave, Ryoko enters.

RYOKO
Hey Washu do you have the flowers.

WASHU
Of course.

Washu hands Ryoko a gold platter with cherry blossoms.

RYOKO
Isn't this a little small?

WASHU
Nothing I have ever done could be classified as, "A little small".

Ryoko sticks her hand in the platter and finds no bottom.

A look of understanding crosses Ryoko's face.

RYOKO
Thank you mom.

WASHU
It will keep the blossoms fresh so you can give it to Sasami now.

RYOKO
I will mom, bye.

Ryoko turns to leave.

WASHU
Oh, Ryoko?

Ryoko turns around.

RYOKO
Yes.

WASHU
There is something I need to tell you.

RYOKO
What is it?

WASHU
It is... It is very important.

Ryoko moves to stand in front of Washu.

RYOKO
Tenchi is not going to leave me.  He has a different set of priorities.

WASHU
If you ever lost Tenchi, for any reason, I want you to know that life
still goes on.

RYOKO
If I lost Tenchi would life be worth going on.

WASHU
That is a decision I can't make for you Ryoko.  Remember the easy way out is
seldom the best way.

RYOKO
I don't know if I can be as strong as you can mom.

WASHU
There is something else I need to say.

Ryoko looks at Washu.

WASHU
I love you.

Ryoko hugs Washu tightly.

RYOKO
Those three words can forgive anything.  I love you to, mother.

WASHU
Enjoy life Ryoko.  Live it to the fullest. Here take this.

Washu turns and walks away.

Ryoko looks down and see a very ornate ring.

RYOKO
What is this mother?

Washu stops as a door appears before her.  She places her hand on the door.

WASHU
It is something I gave to the first man I ever loved.  He gave it back to me.

RYOKO
I can't take this.

WASHU
You told me Tenchi was different.  I've carried that burden for 20,000
years.  This is the first chance I ever had to set it down.

Ryoko walks up to Washu.

RYOKO
Thank you mother.  We will restore the love in this ring.

Ryoko kisses Washu and exits the lab.

Washu leaves through the door.

INT. Tenchi's bedroom - NIGHT (Friday, 13 June 1997)

Daijiro and Kazuhiko are trying on their formal Kimonos.

KAZUHIKO
We are looking good.

DAIJIRO
Where did you get these?  This is the finest silk I have ever seen.

TENCHI
Well you know how Little Washu is.  She never does things by halves.

DAIJIRO
Tomorrow is the big day.  Are you getting a little nervous?

TENCHI
Why would marrying someone who flies through walls and blows things up
make me nervous?

KAZUHIKO
Makes me nervous just thinking about it.

Grandfather enters the room.

Tenchi leans close to the other two.

TENCHI
I can tell this is going to be trouble.

GRANDFATHER
Ah, there you are Tenchi.  Quickly all of you need to come with me.

places his towel on his head.

Tenchi, Daijiro, and Kazuhiko join the two.

GRANDFATHER
This is a tradition older than I am.  It is your last night of true freedom
Tenchi.  We will eat and drink everything on this table.  If you awake
tomorrow then you can go through with the wedding.  If not, then such is fate.

TENCHI
Are you serious Grandfather?

FATHER
Oh he is serious all right.  Made me do the same thing.  It's a good 
thing Achika knew how her father worked.  She kicked me out of bed the
next morning.

KAZUHIKO
Don't worry Tenchi, Daijiro and I will help you.  I could pack away what is
On the table myself.

Grandfather and Father share a laugh.

TENCHI
Okay, what's the joke?

Dancing follows the presents.

Tenchi and Ryoko dance with all the guests.

Tenchi and Ryoko are dancing together.

RYOKO
This is a day I never even dreamed of.

TENCHI
Not even in the nearly two years you spent with me.

RYOKO
I hoped this would happen, but to believe it would come true did not occur
until that night at dinner.

TENCHI
You have been there for me all of my life.  It is my turn now.  I love you
Ryoko.

RYOKO
I love you Tenchi.  I am tired now.

Tenchi and Ryoko stop dancing.

ear and her hand on his chest.

RYOKO
That was pretty good for your first time.

TENCHI
Ryoko!

Ryoko's finger traces a random pattern over Tenchi's chest.

RYOKO
I won't keep any secrets from you Tenchi.

TENCHI
Then this wasn't... Ah...

RYOKO
I was Kagato's slave for a few thousand years.  All I knew then was Pain,
Anger, and Loneliness.  It wasn't until I met you that I learned Love was
more than a word.

TENCHI
I am so sorry Ryoko.  If I could change the past I would.

RYOKO
No, Tenchi.  Leave the past be.  It brought us together and I would
endure it again for that reason alone.

Tenchi hugs Ryoko closely.

RYOKO
Ready for another round?

Ryoko!

I am going to train you well, Tenchi.  I want to make sure that Ayeka's first
time is even more memorable than yours.

Ayeka enters the scene.

She sits on the floor and leans against Tenchi's door.

AYEKA
Ah...  Ah... Ah...

RYOKO
Come on in Princess.

You will be much warmer sleeping in here then out there.

The lady tried to take away my baby.

AYEKA
Hush little one.  You are here with Lord Tenchi now.  You will be safe.

Ryoko climbs out of bed and puts on a robe.

RYOKO
I think you will need a bigger bed Tenchi.

Ryoko pulls a futon and blankets out of the closet and sets up a bed on
the floor.

RYOKO
Come here Little Princess.  You can sleep with your sister Ryoko tonight.

Tenchi sits up in bed clutching the sheet around him.

TENCHI
You three should have the bed.  I will sleep on the pallet.

RYOKO
Oh no Tenchi.  You need your strength so you stay right there.  I will be
fine down here.

Ayeka carries Sasami over to the futon and places her in the middle.

The three girls pull the covers over themselves.

SASAMI
I am still scared Ayeka.

AYEKA
Do not fear Sasami.  We will not abandon you.

Tenchi lies back down and stares at the ceiling.

TENCHI (Expressed as thought)
Do what you will lady.  You will not win.

We see D3.

D3
My Lady, there has been a three fold increase in the Jurai power in
the SOL system.

Washu and Tsunami are bold in their moves.

D3
My Lady, could our inactivity be a mistake?

TOKIMI (O. C.)
You will do nothing to interfere with them.

D3
I see my Lady.  You have other plans then.

We see Tokimi with her twin shadows of Washu and Tsunami.

TOKIMI
I will test the boy.

D3 (O. C.)
I understand my Lady.  I will leave it in your capable hands.

TOKIMI
I must know if he is worthy.

FADE OUT:

THE END



Bonus: Ryoko's Wedding Song (After the explanation for the song).

Over seven hundred years ago Yoshou imprisoned Ryoko in a cave.  He took
away her gems and left her all alone as he departed Okayama.  The prison
was in truth the heart of his Life Tree, Funaho.  The only power left to
Ryoko was the ability to astrally project herself to the cave entrance and
no further.  She could sit at the entrance and watch the seasons go by one
at a time.  On rare occasion a hermit might take refuge at the cave.  This
would have been worse for Ryoko than being alone.  To have someone near
that did not know you existed, and being unable to effect them in any way.

After six hundred forty years of this, Yoshou returned to Okayama.  He would
go to the cave to look at Ryoko but otherwise he ignored her.  He bought his
new bride, Etsuki, to the cave, and started a tradition of gathering at the
cave.  Ryoko could watch the young couple enjoy a family picnic in front of
her, and see Yoshou look at her.  Then Achika was born and Yoshou brought his
daughter to the cave so Ryoko could see her.  Still Yoshou would not
acknowledge Ryoko's presence.  When her mother died Achika came to the cave
to cry out her pain.

Achika maintained the family tradition by bringing Nobuyuki to the cave.
That young couple would also have family picnics in front of her.  Then one
day Achika brought her son, Tenchi, to the cave, and Ryoko's life changed.
Tenchi could see her.  Tenchi would spend a lot of time with Ryoko as he
grew up.  She was his only friend in the lonely mountains of Okayama, and
Ryoko learned that there was more to the universe than her alone.

One day Tenchi came to the cave to pour out his heart.  He told of his
mother's death.  Tenchi spoke to the rock on which Ryoko normally sat.
This time she wasn't there, and Ryoko knew that Tenchi could no longer see
her.  She moved to the rock so she could pretend that Tenchi was talking to
her.  She tried her best to comfort the little boy and remove his pain.
Ryoko was learning the meaning of love.

Tenchi would continue to go to the cave to talk to the friend he could no
longer see.  He would tell of his day, both good and bad.  He would reveal
his brightest dreams and darkest secrets.  Then one day he said good bye.
Ryoko thought she was once again alone in the world.  Yoshou came up to her
while she sat on her rock crying.  For the first time in six hundred and
ninety years Yoshou spoke to Ryoko.  He told her that one day Tenchi would
set her free.

Yoshou never again returned to the cave while Ryoko was imprisoned.  He
ensured that no one else visited the cave.  Ryoko would have to wait another
ten years before her last hope would come true.

The lyrics to Ryoko's Wedding song were meant to reflect on Ryoko's last
seven hundred years of life.  Those years had a greater impact on her than
the first four thousand.

I can't write music, so if any of my readers wish to do so, then please do.
Contact me with your music and I will try to get this song recorded and
posted for all to enjoy.

Ryoko's Wedding Song

Vocals: Ryoko

Here I lie in my lonely room
My captor leaves me to my fate
I watch him walk by free each day
He is the one I long to hate

Someday he will be mine
The day I am free he will die

When my captor strolls by today
With a woman happy and free
They both share a smile and kiss
How long I wish that I were she

Through winter's cold and springtime growth
Past summer rain and autumn leaves
All the seasons blend into one
This hole in my heart
Hungers to be filled
As time passes me by

Now my captor is at my stone
A young baby girl he does hold
The young family plays in the sun
I sit here in the dark and cold

Someday he will be mine
For his crime I will make him cry

Now the young girl is at my stone
Her cries of anguish fill the air
Her teardrops fall like summer rain
I wonder why it is I care

Through winter's cold and springtime growth
Past summer rain and autumn leaves
All the seasons blend into one
This hole in my heart
Hungers to be filled
As time passes me by

The young girl is all grown up now
And a young man has caught her eye
My captor smiles on them both
And I do wonder why I cry

Someday he will be mine
For what I no longer know why

Now the woman is at my stone
A young baby boy she does hold
The young family plays in the sun
I sit here in the dark and cold

Through winter's cold and springtime growth
Past summer rain and autumn leaves
All the seasons blend into one
This hole in my heart
Hungers to be filled
As time passes me by

And now the boy's cries fill the air
And his teardrops wash clean my stone
I try to touch him so he'll stop
Same as he, I am all alone

Someday he will be mine
So I can love before I die

The boy is now a handsome man
He comes inside to set me free
I want to show him my true love
But pain is all I know you see

Through winter's cold and springtime growth
Past summer rain and autumn leaves
All the seasons blend into one
This hole in my heart
Hungers to be filled
As time passes me by

And so I chase my new man down
I will pursue him to the end
Although he is my captor's child
I only see him as my friend

Someday he will be mine
Together now our love will fly

Now I hear those wondrous words
And today our true love does soar
Then both of us will say I do
Our love is now forevermore

Through winter's cold and springtime growth
Past summer rain and autumn leaves
All the seasons blend into one
This hole in my heart
Hungers to be filled
As time passes me by


Thank you, Zervon
