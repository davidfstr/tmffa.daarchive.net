Dragon Love for You and Me

 Part 5: No Ritual or Ceremony


She began to feel uncomfortable with Yosho. She felt that he was 
dreading something in his heart. He wouldn't talk to her, or be as 
passionate as he used to be. Something was wrong. She had been spending 
the past hours with Tenchi. His friends Washu, Mihoshi, Kiyoni, Ayekan 
(Ayeka), and Sasamu, (Sasami) finally woke up. They all looked so 
familiar to her for some reason. Tonight was the night of the Raining 
Butterfly Roses. It was a very special event for the Faithians. 
However, this was the Third time it would occur in Jurai though. This 
rare event meant the Faithian Princess to be cleaned of all sins and 
what ever they lost shall return. Ryoko invited Tenchi to come with his 
friends. What bothered her the most of this ritual was the fact that 
they also lose something. 
She walked up to the Church of Jurai. Her off white Faithian 
robes swaying in the wind. Azaka (humanoid form) stood behind her. She 
put the thought behind her as she walked in. Sasamu came from behind 
the statue. "Hello Ryoko." She squeaked. Ryoko gave the little girl a 
hug. "Are you ready to go?" She asked. Sasamu nodded her head. Ayekan, 
Mihoshi, Kiyoni, and Washu came own the stairs. Ryoko looked to see yet 
no Tenchi. "Tenchi would like to see you Miss Ryoko." Ayekan whispered. 
As the others walked out side to board the ship to Faith Ryoko walked 
up the small stairs. As she entered the room she say Tenchi in the 
Faithian robes. Tenchi looked up to see her slightly blushing. 'He's 
wearing the clothes I made for him.' Ryoko thought to herself. "You 
look lovely Ryoko." He complimented. Her blush grew redder. "As do you 
Tenchi." She replied. Tenchi looked at window. 
"Where is Yosho?" He asked. Ryoko looked at him. "He couldn't 
come. He had other matters to attend to." She replied softly. Tenchi 
walked over towards her. "I'll be your escort then." He added She took 
his arm and walked out of the church together. 'Why couldn't I tell her 
the truth of my feeling?' Tenchi thought. 
*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*&*
 Yosho felt horrible. The pain in his heart didn't go away. He 
sat in front of Miko's crib. Watching the cover that should have 
covered the baby. Ryoko took the baby with her to Faith. He also knew 
of the ritual of the Raining Butterfly Roses. 'I can't let Ryoko see me 
die.' He thought. Ayeka   walked by to see Yosho. She saddens as she 
saw what room he was in. He turned his head to see her. She quickly 
walked out of view. He carefully walked to the door and slammed it 
closed. In addition, that's when he saw the God Naf appear. His hand 
forming an energy blast. Yosho brought out his sword Tenchi-ken.

The ride was shorter than Tenchi expected. Less than 20 minutes 
long. When everyone was off a tall handsome boy with straight cyan hair 
and tan-ish yellow eyes came over to Ryoko. They hugged and kissed 
cheeks. Ayekan gave Ryoko the baby to show this person. "It's been to 
long baby sister." He said. Ryoko laughed lightly. "Oh you can say that 
again Yohro." Ryoko replied. Miko tried to grab as much of his hair 
possible. Tenchi smiled softly. Ayekan knew that he was hiding 
something. Then others came, Ryoko's mother, father, little sister, and 
her grandmother. 'So this is the family that I left Ryoko with.' Washu 
thought sadly.  
Ryoko seemed very happy to see her family again. Before Tenchi 
knew it, he had been introduced to the family. As they made their way 
to the castle Ryoko and Yohro talked. Tenchi figured it was just for 
them to catch up on the years they have been separated. Ayeka seemed a 
little upset from the site that came up. When she saw Tenchi escorting 
Ryoko on the space ship. It was hard enough to remember what really 
happened all those years ago. Maybe in the end Yosho came to be hers or 
was it Tenchi? She seemed confused at the moment. Although she was sure 
of herself before but that was then and this is now.
"What do you mean that you like Tenchi more than Yosho?" Ryoko 
asked her brother. He chuckled silently to himself. "I really don't 
know but Tenchi seems to be fond of you my dear sister. I think that he 
may be stronger than that so called husband Yosho." Yohro said quiet 
pleased. "Oh just because he is wiser than you'll ever be doesn't mean 
you can talk dirty about him, to his own wife. I say it seems that you 
get so jealous of him sometimes." Ryoko giggled. Yohro stopped 
suddenly. Ryoko looked at him curiously. The rest of the group getting 
farther from them. "Ryoko what ever happened to use getting married 
huh? Yah we were kids but I kinda hopped." Yohro said as if about to 
cry. Ryoko walked up to him and slowly caressed his cheek. "We were 
young but things happened. I never knew it would hurt you though."  
Ryoko whispered. 
"Just promise me, that if something happens to Yosho would you 
come back to me? Even  marry me?" Yohro asked looking into her eyes. 
Ryoko nodded slowly and kissed him on the cheek. He looked at the 
passage that was empty except the few soldiers on guard who didn't seem 
to be listening. Yohro smiled happily. "How bout we beat the others to 
the castle?" He asked. The princess just nodded happily. Then they both 
teleported away from view.

Hours had passed and dinner had been served. Now it was time for 
the Raining Butterfly Roses ceremony. The cyan haired Princess sat on 
her chair in the dressing room. She was wearing a sleeveless dress that 
showed too much skin. Barely showing the chest and the bottom area. 
(you know what I'm talking about.) black with a little red at the 
edges. She wondered what would be happening to her. As she sighed her 
brother Yohro came in. It was just too obvious that he was her escort 
to the ritual. As she got to her feet, a howl lot of jewelry appeared 
on her. He smiled as she smirked at the jewelry. 
They held hands as they walked down the never-ending aisle. 
Although her heart was beating normally the feeling of her mind 
overcame her. To tell the truth she was scared out of her mind. Her 
mother never told her of this ritual. She didn't know what to expect.  
As they came to the closed curtain Ryoko wanted to turn back. Yohro 
gave her a look of reassurance. She smiled grimly and pushed the satin 
curtain aside as she walked in. The room was surrounded by plants. The 
floor was covered with sand. It looked like a waterfall in the 
background, and a lake or pond in front of her. She saw her grandmother 
come toward her. She lightly took Ryoko's hand and placed it in hers. 
"Come with me my child." She said. She walked into the pond that 
began to get foggy.  Ryoko looked around at the pond, as she was in the 
color of the pond changed to a creamy white. Tenchi and the others came 
around the pond to watch this event. The grandmother laid her down in 
the pond wit her head up. She began chanting an old Faithian talk that 
was lost along time ago. Ryoko looked at her and began to feel 
uncomfortable about laying in a pond. The others found that Ryoko was 
changing. Her eyes had become all white and her dress all white also. 
She began to float in the air and into the fog. The grandmothers 
primitive chanting became louder by the minute. Ryoko was surrounded 
with the fog. Then something in the corner shone bright. A man 
appeared, is figure was quiet cloudy. However, Tenchi had heard about 
this God Naf. He floated up to Ryoko and held her. The grand mother 
stopped chanting and walked out of the pond. 
Ryoko looked at Naf and lifted his hand to her face. He looked at 
her and then kissed her lips. (did you see that coming?) Her eyes 
became normal  and her dress back to normal. The only change was that 
she seemed to have Light Hawk Wings. The number of them was 12. ten in 
front and two wings in the back. Ayekan  was surprised that Ryoko could 
bring up the Light Hawk Wings. As Ryoko floated back down to the floor 
Naf whispered in her eyes became watery. As she landed on the pond the 
color now silver, she dropped to the bottom. Tenchi seeing this ran 
into the pond. Naf looked quiet upset at the fact that Tenchi ran to 
help her and that when he ran in the pond it became a gold color on the 
ripples. 
Tenchi helped her up to her feet. He saw her crying and held her 
close. Before Ayekan could even make it in the pond Yohro came charging 
in, pushing Tenchi aside. He tried consoling his sister but he felt it 
was because of Naf that this is happening. He looked up at the god and 
shock his fist. Ryoko walked away from him and out of the room. Yohro 
looked at the others. "Yosho is dead." Was all he said as his head fell 
down from his prideful stand.  Tenchi looked at the curtain that had 
just returned to its place. Ayekan nodded her head. Tenchi was about to 
run after her until he was stopped by the small hand of  Washu . 
"Tenchi if my data is correct this is the point were Ryoko is 
taken over by Kagato. Get to her fast Tenchi.  We'll get to Yosho and 
bring him back to us. Just get to my daughter as soon as possible." 
Washu said almost crying. Tenchi nodded and ran out of the room.
(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(*(**(**(*(*(*(*(*(*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)
*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)
Ryoko cried in her room. Why did it have to be him? She kept 
asking herself. As a dark figure appeared in the corner of her room.  
She heard the swift movement of a cloak. When she turned her head,  she 
saw a man with long light lavender hair and small glasses. This was 
Kagato. Her mind went blank as he stepped toward her. She jumped up and 
moved away. His laugh was like knifes stabbing her heart. "My dear 
daughter why do you run from me?" he asked his grin disappearing. Ryoko 
looked up at him and laughed. "You aren't my father." Kagato laughed 
harder. His grin now a smirk. "Oh yes I am. You never wondered why you 
can't remember your past? Oh such a pity for you. Oh well no one can 
save you." He laughed as he walked over to her. he put his hand out 
from under the cap and caught Ryoko in a bind.
Tenchi then stormed through the door. Kagato turned his head to 
see him. Ryoko stuck against the wall. Kagato turned around to face 
Tenchi.   Ryoko looked at Tenchi and saw something in him. He was a 
Jurain. She looked down and prayed for him to have her Light Hawk 
Wings. Kagato   shout a energy blast at Tenchi that missed and then 
spread all over the room. Tenchi found that he was protected by the 
twelve  Light Hawk Wing that Ryoko had. Kagato grimaced at that of what 
he saw. Ryoko still prayed under her breath. As Tenchi took one wing 
and it became a sword, he looked at Kagato with the look of death. Then 
he made his battle cry and two  became engaged in battle.


Author Notes: Hey sorry for it taking a while but homework come up. So 
anyway next it: will Tenchi win the battle with Kagato? Is Yosho going 
to be brought back to life? In addition, where is Miko in all of this? 
Hey thanx to the people that sent me stuff saying they liked the story.
