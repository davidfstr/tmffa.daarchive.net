Tenchi Muyo Follow your heart
Chapter 3


"Grandfather did I do the right thing?" uttered Tenchi
when Yosho stepped next to him.
"She had to find out sooner or later.  And it was
better that you told her rather than having her find
out a different way."

	After Yosho and Tenchi walked into the house Emperor
Azusa steps out of a nearby shaded area.
"Azaka, Kamadake, I want you to follow Ayeka and make
sure nothing happens to her.  In the event she has an
argument with Ryoko and is hit by her I want you two
to arrenst her."

"Excuse us your majesty but what would be our reason
for arresting princess Ayeka."
"Ryoko.  You arrest Ryoko and place her in the
strongest holding cell within my ship.  Also, inform
Ayeka that she is to see me at once."
"Yes your majesty."
"On second thought I'll accompany you to make sure my
orders are closely followed."

*******************************************************

Ryoko is sitting down on one of Funaho's roots and
crying.
<Why?  Why did he make that decision?  I thought he
loved me.>  She is distracted from her thoughts when 
Ayeka walks towards her.
"We need to talk!"
"Not now Ayeka, I prefer to be alone if you don't
mind."
"I do mind, demon!"
"Ok Ayeka, what is it you..."
"You bitch, how could you take him from me!?"
"I could ask you the same question, princess."
"You know he was mine even before he was born."
"But did you love him from the first time you saw
him?"
"That does not matter!  He is a member of the Royal
family and must not associate with, least of all marry
a creature like you."
"Is that the only answer you can come up with Ayeka. 
I fell in love with him the first time I saw him.  And
my love for him only grew more as time went by."
"Enough!"  Stated Ayeka as she trembled with rage.  "I
will get you...you thief!"
	With out warning, Ayeka vaulted at Ryoko and tackles
her into the pond.  Caught off guard, Ryoko swallowed
a mouth full of water.  When she came up gasping for
air, Ayeka executed a solid right upper cut to her
chin.  Knocking her back into the same spot
she rose up from.  Feeling victorious, Ayeka leaped to
where Ryoko had fallen.  Immediately shoving Ryoko's
head bellow the water line in order to finish her off.
 Once she recovered from the hit, Ryoko teleported out
of Ayeka's grasp and materialized behind her.  As
Ayeka turned around to face her opponent, Ryoko simply
pushed her.  Causing Ayeka to stumble backwards into
the water.  Enraged, Ayeka toppled over several times
as she tried to stand up.
	Levitating off the surface, Ryoko declares.
"Ayeka, I made a promise with Tenchi that I would no
longer fight with you.  And I do not plan on breaking
my word to him.  So I suggest that you cool off for a
bit and leave me alone."

"Azaka, Kamadake seize her."

	Ryoko is surprised to find herself held within the
guardian's forcefield once more.
"What is this Ayeka?  You couldn't beat me in a fair
fight so now you intend to use your grardians to hold
me.  Is this the only way you know how to win a
fight?"
"I'd never.  I didn't order them to do this."
"Is that so?  Would you mind telling me whose orders
they follow at all times."
"Mine."
"And mine as well."  Stated Emperor Azusa as he
stepped towards the edge of the pond.
"Father."
"What is the meaning of this Ayeka, are you using your
daddy to get rid of me?"
"No!"
"Well then why am I being held within this
forcefield?"
"Ryoko, you are under arrest for attempting to
assassinate my daughter."
"What do you mean by assassinate, she attacked me."
"I am referring to the fight you just had with Ayeka. 
It was by shear luck that my daughter brought up her
defense shield before your killing blow struck."
"That's a lie!"
"Father, that is not what happened."
"Silence Ayeka.  That is what I saw and that is
exactly what happened."
"Father didn't you make a deal with Tenchi concerning
the safety of Ryoko?"
<Pathetic boy, thinking he could contaminate the blood
line of the Royal family by marring this piece of
space trash. >  "Yes, I made a deal with him.  The
deal was that any and all previous incidents and
disputes between you two would be forgotten.  I never
mentioned anything about new fights.  As you can see,
Tenchi is getting his first lesson in negotiations.
Always listen to what is said and make
sure that what you want out of a deal is strongly
enforced."
"You back stabbing bastard!  You lied to him."
"Father how could you?"
"Enough Ayeka.  Azaka, Kamadake take the pirate to my
ship and put her in the strongest cell available."
As both guardians and their prisoner disappear,
Emperor Azusa faces his daughter.
"Ayeka you must not tell anyone of what has happened
here."
"Father where are you taking Ryoko and what is to
become of her?"
"That is none of your concern.  She will be dealt with
by the laws of our people."
"Will she be alright?"
"Now why are you so concerned about her?"
"Tenchi loves her and will be looking for her if she
disappears."
"Do you want to share him with the likes of her?"
"No father, I would not."
"Well then, all I am going to do is detain her long
enough so you can both be married and have some time
alone."
"But what about Tenchi, he will still wonder where she
went to."
"Do not worry about him, he will be kept too busy to
notice she is missing."
Not all conviced and not wanting to ask her father any
more questions Ayeka turns around and walks back
toward the house.  Once she is out of sight, the
emperor is transported into his ship.

"Emperor Azusa, Ryoko has been placed within the most
strongest cell available.  Also, a company of solders
have been placed on roaming duty within that area for
extra insurance."
"Excellent, now make preparations for one of our flag
ships to pick her up and take her to Jurai.  Make sure
they have an excort of no less then ten battle
cruisers."
"Yes Sir."
"Captain, I want them to be in and out of here before
my daughters wedding.  And if they are late both you
and captains of those vessels will face similar
punishments as Ryoko.
Do I make myself clear!"
"Yes your majesty.  Everything will be done as you
request.  You have my word."

*******************************************************

"Good morning Sasami, have you seen Ryoko or Ayeka
this morning."
"Why, Good morning Tenchi.  No I haven't seen either
of them since yesterday.  By the way have you seen
Ryo-Ohki?"
"No but I'm pretty sure she might be with Ryoko."

	As Tenchi steps out of the house, he spots Ayeka
standing on the dock looking out to the horizon above
the lake.  At this moment she is presently flanked by
both her guardians.
"Good morning Miss Ayeka.  How are you feeling this
morning?"
"Good morning Lord Tenchi."  As she takes in a deep
breathe to relax she continues to respond.  "I feel
much better.  Now if you'll excuse me I have some
business to attend to with my mother and aunt."
"I'm glad to see you feeling much better Miss Ayeka."
	Both slightly bow to each other as they begin to go
their separate ways.
"Excuse me, Azaka and Kamadake but have either of you
two seen Ryoko anytime since yesterday night?"
	Both guardians face each other and remember the
orders given to them by Emperor Azusa.  <Neither of
you is to inform the others as to the whereabouts of
Ryoko.  She is to be taken care of by our court system
and brought to justice.  There is no way I will ever
allow him to desecrate the Jurian bloodline by
producing an offspring with that creature.  Is this
understood!  'Yes your majesty.'  Good now accompany
Ayeka back and do not give her any information about
Ryoko's true situation.>  "No we haven't seen her, we
have been with princess Ayeka for some time now.
"Well if by chance you do see her, could you please
tell her that I need to speak with her."
"Yes Tenchi, we will inform her of your request."
	As they depart, Tenchi proceeds in the direction of
Ryoko's cave while Azaka and Kamadake follow Ayeka
into the house.
	When she walks into the house everyone is eating
breakfast.  Promptly, she sits next to Sasami and eats
her meal.  Once Sasami and Mihoshi pick-up the plates
and exit to the kitchen, she asks Lady Funaho what she
wanted to discuss with her.
"Oh yes.  Both Misaki and I wanted to discuss some
issues in private with you."
"Both you and my mother?  I had thought that it was
only going to be the both of us."
"This is a matter which must be discussed by the three
of us.  Now if you are ready please follow me."  Lady
Funaho begins to lead them to the entrance of Washu's
lab.
"Excuse me Lady Funaho, but that door leads to Washu's
lab."
"Yes, I know.  She has been kind enough to lend us one
of her rooms.  Azaka, Kamadake I need you both to
guard this entrance.  Only little Washu is allowed to
enter while we are in here.  Is that understood."
"Yes my queen."
	Lady Funaho leads both women to the same room, which
she and Washu used during their conversation.  As soon
as they took their seats, Lady Funaho started the
conversation.  "Well that was an interesting
announcement by Azusa, don't you two agree?"
"Yes it was Aunt Funaho.  I'm so happy that Lord
Tenchi and I will soon be getting married."
"Yes Ayeka, I must agree with you on that note.  How
about you sister?  What do you think of this
situation?"
"Oh my little Ayeka is finally getting married!  I am
so happy for her.  Where has the time gone, it only
seems as if it were yesterday when I was cradling her
in my arms."
"Mother your embarrassing me."
"Oh my little Ayeka is growing up so fast.  In time
she will have children of her own and I'll be getting
called 'grandmother'."
"Uh...Yea...children."
"Are you all right Ayeka?  You appear to be a bit
uncofortable with the idea of kids."
"I'm fine auntie, it's just that I'm still some what
shocked by yesterdays news."
"Little Ayeka, everyone was so happy and cheering for
both of you when your father finished his speech."
"Everyone except Ryoko who ran outside crying."
announced Lady Funaho.
"Oh my, I didn't notice she was crying.  She really
must love Tenchi a lot.  Maybe he'll make her his
second wife.  Think of it Ayeka both you and Ryoko,
sisters."
"No!!!  He does not love her nor will he marry her!"
"Ayeka!?"
"I'm sorry mother, its just that..."
"Tenchi loves Ryoko."
"What!?  How did you...I mean where did you get such
an idea auntie."
"Yes sister where did you get such a concept from."
"From Tenchi himself of course."
"What?"  Replied both Ayeka and Lady Misaki.
"I had a conversation with him yesterday when he told
me of his relationship with Ryoko.
I can show both of you some proof if you would like to
see it."
"Yes auntie, I would like to observe this evidence you
have."
"As you wish Ayeka.  Sister, are you all right? 
Misaki!?"
"Don't worry Lady Funaho.  She's only experiencing a
bit of shock."
"Little Washu, excellent timing.  Can you please play
the scene, of Tenchi and Ryoko, you showed me
yesterday."
"Of course it's one of my favorites, let me just get
some popcorn first.  Would anyone else like some?"
	Misaki snaps out of her state of shock when the scene
of Tenchi and Ryoko dancing comes into view.  "My they
really do make a beautiful couple."
"Mother, what are you saying?"
	As Lady Misaki is about to reply, the scene in which
Tenchi announces his love to Ryoko appears before
them.  Both Lady Misaki and Ayeka stare in silence as
the couple shown in the monitor kiss each other for
several minutes.  When the monitor is turned off Washu
says, "That scene always brings tears to my
eyes."
"No!  It's all a lie!"  Yelled Ayeka.
"When did this occur, little Washu."  Asked Lady
Misaki wanting to know more of the situation unfolding
before her.
"The evening before you arrived."
"Now I know that was a fake!  Ryoko was in your lab
that day after our fight."
"What fight little Ayeka?"
"It was nothing mother, really."
"Ayeka, you used Tenchi-ken on her and by doing so you
inflicted severe damage on her."  Stated Washu as she
points to a monitor, which appears showing Ryoko's
smoking body being brought in by Azaka and Kamadake.
"Ayeka, why did you do such a thing to Ryoko?"  Asked
Lady Misaki.
"It was an accident.  Both she and Tenchi were holding
hands when I got angry and started fighting her."
"Yes a fight whcih almost killed her."  Declared Washu
as she turned to look at her.
"What?"
"Ayeka, Ryoko's body was in such a dreadful state that
she almost died twice that day while I was trying to
save her."
"I...I didn't mean for it to go that far.  I was only
trying to make her leave Tenchi alone."
"Why would you want to do that little Ayeka?"
"Because she would make Tenchi uncomfortable every
time she tried to seduce him.  Also, he didn't love
her."
"Do you really believe that Ayeka?"  Asked Lady
Funaho.
"Yes I do."
"If that is so, why didn't he try to stop her?"
"He always told her to stop but she would only listen
to a certain extent.  Also, she would do this to get
me upset."
"But she did love him did she not?"  Asked Lady
Misaki.
"I cannot say, I am not her nor do I wish to even
consider that thought."
"Ayeka, I believe you have known that answer for some
time now."  Stated Funaho.
"How could he ever love someone like her instead of
me?  And now thanks to the information you told him he
is going to ask Ryoko to marry him."
"When does he plan to marry her Little Ayeka?"  Asked
her mother as she placed her arm around Ayeka in order
to comfert her.
"Before we get married.  He wants her to be his first
wife, instead of me."
"Well then maybe you might be the first one to give
him a child."
Once hearing this, Ayeka begins to cry.  "He...He told
me that she is the only one he plans to have a family
with since he considers me his friend and nothing
more."
"We might have a problem here."  Stated Lady Funaho.
"I'll say we have a problem!  My little Ayeka is
getting married and will not be able to experience the
joys of motherhood, thanks to you sister.  And I do
want to have grandchildren."
"Lady Misaki, I believe Lady Funaho is referring to
some information I had provided to her on Ryoko.  When
my daughter was injured, I was able to perform some
tests on her.  And with the results from these tests I
was able to calculate that both Tenchi and my daughter
are not compatible if you know what I mean."
"What are you implying little Washu."  Asked Misaki.
"I'm stating that Tenchi and Ryoko will not be able to
have any children.  My daughter knows about this
information but has not been able to tell him about it
as of yet."
"Well then I believe it is up to us to inform Tenchi
about Ryoko's condition so my little Ayeka can provide
an offspring to continue the royal line."
"Lady Misaki."
"Yes little Washu."
"I believe it is best that Ryoko tell him."
"When will she tell him little Washu.  After they are
married."  Voiced Ayeka.
"If that is the case.  But remember this Ayeka, it is
her body that is incompatible not your.  Give her some
time."  <Also try not to gloat so much after she tells
him.>
"All right, I will do as you request."
"Thank you Ayeka, by the way have you seen her."
"Sorry little Washu, but I have not."
"Well if by any chance you do see her could you inform
her that I wish to speak with her."
"I'll relay your message if I see her."

*******************************************************

"Good morning Tenchi, your kind of early today. 
Practice is not until this afternoon."
"Good morning grandfather, actually I'm searching for
Ryoko.  By any chance have you seen her?"
"Sorry Tenchi, I have not seen her all morning."
"I wonder where she has gone off too.  She wasn't in
my room when I woke-up this morning, nor was she at
the cave."
"Are you worried?"
"Yes I'm worried.  I can't stop thinking about her. 
Everywhere I look there is something that reminds me
of her and how special she is to me."
"Have you tried asking Little Washu, yet?"
"Not yet."
"Remember that she, Ryoko, and Ryo-Ohki can
communicate with each other with their mind link."
"How could I forget.  Thank you grandfather."
"Forget about practice today, you have more important
business to take care off.  I'll just double your
regular regiment of training toworrow so you won't
slack off."
"...."

*******************************************************

"Little Washu."
"Is that you Tenchi?"
"Yes it is.  Excuse me little Washu but have you seen
Ryoko?"
"No, Tenchi I'm sorry I haven't."
"Little Washu, is it possible for you to use your mind
link to find you where she is?"
"I'm sorry Tenchi, but I prefer not to invade her
privacy with the link at this moment."
"Please little Washu,  I'm worried about her and I
need to talk to her."
"What ever it is it can wait until she comes back of
her own free will."
"No it can't.  Please Little Washu!"
"Ok, tell me what could be so important that it would
make me invade her privacy at this moment."
"I need to tell her the reason for my decision and
that I do not wish to lose her.  Also, if she would
allow me to be her husband..."
"What!?  Are you going to propose to my little Ryoko?"
"Yes.  If it is all right with you little Washu.  I
would like to have your permission to marry Ryoko."
"Tenchi, could you do me a favor?"
"What is it little Washu?"
"Could you call me, mom."
"Yes mother Washu."
"Thank you.  Now lets find my daughter."

	After several attempts of trying to communicate with
Ryoko, Washu informs Tenchi on her failure.
"It's no use Tenchi, I can't get a signal from her. 
Its almost as if something is blocking our signals. 
I've also tried to reach Ryo-Ohki and the results are
the same."
"Could it be that they have left Earth and are
traveling in space away from your reach?"
"If they are in space, they haven't gone past the
first marker."
"First marker?"
"Yes.  I have designed and set up several monitors at
various distances away from the Earth.  Each one of
these monitors is designed to let me know when one of
us is leaving or comming."
"Is there any way she could pass through the markers
without you knowing about it?"
"That is highly unlikely since I placed a detector
within each of the monitor fields specifically
designed by me to identify each of our genetic
make-up.  Also, since I tend to do everyones physical
around here I placed an added insurace on each one of
us.  One of my very own DNA identification, 'Washu was
here', is place on everyones genetic structures.
It's a small precautionary step I've taken since the
last kidnapping we had."
"Where are these monitor fields located, mother
Washu?"
"There are three rings after the first one to be
precise.  The first ring is set around the Earth.  The
next one is in the same orbital pattern of the planet
Saturn, followed by Pluto, and the final ring is at
the edge of this galaxy."
"Why such a big gap between the last two rings?"
"Didn't I tell you.  One of the functions of those two
monitors is to track the flight paths of every ship
within this sector.  I can approximate the origin of
the flight and its destination."
"Wow."
"What?  There are many worlds out there which would
pay a fortune for these devices and all you can say
is, wow."
"Don't get me wrong mother Washu, it's a great
invention."
"Of course it is.  After all I am the greatest
scientific genius in the Universe."
"Uh...right mom.  Well if you'll excuse me I have to
get something to eat since I missed breakfast this
morning.  Can you inform me as soon as you find
Ryoko?"
"Don't worry, I'll tell her you are looking for her
when I find her.  And I won't tell her that you are
planning to propose to her.  I'll let you surprise
her."
"Thank you mother Washu."

*******************************************************

When Tenchi emerges from within Washu's lab he bumps
into Ayeka.
"Uh...Miss Ayeka.  Excuse me, I should have been
looking where I was going."
"Tenchi, I've been looking for you for some time now. 
Where have you been?"
"Miss Ayeka, I need to apologize to you about
yesterday.  I've meant to tell you earlier but I never
got the chance.  You must believe me that it was never
my intention to hurt you."
"That's alright Tenchi.  It means nothing to me, now."
<As long as I'll be the first one to marry you.  Also,
thanks to Washu, I know that I'll be the one to give
you a child instead of her. >
"Huh... are you sure?"
"Yes.  Now come on, we had to adjust your schedule
several times already."
"Schedule.  What schedule?"
"This one right here.  It lists all of the activies
you must attend to prepare you for our trip to Jurai."
Looking at the schedule, Tenchi is baffled by the
amount of activities presented on the list.
"There is barely anytime to sleep with this schedule. 
Furthermore, it doesn't give me any time to search for
Ryoko."
"Come on Tenchi, both my mother and aunt are waiting
for you."
"They are, what for?"
"Read the list, it's in there."
Scanning through the list he finds the currnet time
slot.  "Attire?"
"Yes.  You need to start wearing the proper garments
of a Jurain noble and they will be on hand to make
sure you are fitted properly."
"But Ryoko..."
"Will come back when she is ready.  Now let's go, they
are waiting."  Declared Ayeka as she dragged him off.

*******************************************************

"Washu-chan, are you in here?"
"Lord Katsuhito, what brings you by."
"You missed dinner again.  So I brought you someting
to eat."
"Thank you.  I've been busy trying to locate Ryoko
since this morning that I must have lost track of
time."
"I understand, all parents worry about their children
when they are gone for a long period of time, no
matter how old they get.  By the way, any news on her
whereabouts."
"Not yet.  I have done a scan of the area and there is
no sigh of her.  I even tried to use our mind links
but there was no signal from her.  It almost seems as
if she disappeared completely."
"That or someone is blocking both of your signals."
"Are you referring to the Jurain ship."
"Washu, where is the present location of my fathers
ship and its escorts."
As a monitor appears before them with a view of Earth,
Washu replies:  "They are still stationed on a
parallel orbit over Japan."
"Good, will you inform me the moment one of the ships
moves away from its location."
"You suspect that she is imprisoned within one of
their vessels?"
"If that is the case, there is only one way to find
out."
"Now your talking!"  states Washu as she appears next
to him wearing both urban camouflage fatigues and camo
paint while carrying one of her own rifles.  "Are we
going to attack the Jurain's."
"No, nothing that drastic.  I'm just going to talk
with the Emperor."
"Are you sure, we can be in and out there without them
knowing what hit them."
"I'm very sure about this little Washu.  Now if you'll
excuse me, I'll take my leave and see what the Emperor
has to say."
As Yosho reaches teh door, he turns around and asks
her one more question.
"Excuse me little Washu, but what kind of weapon is
that your holding?"
"This is one of my toys.  It is a one of a kind plasma
rifle which has the same destructive force as a
small supernova.  It is lightweight, extremely
portable
and can be fired by someone like
Sasami since it hardly has a recoil effect.  Why do
you ask?"
"No reason, just curious."  As he steps out one thing
comes to mind, <Oh man, someone in here really needs
to go out once in a while.>

*******************************************************

	As night falls, Tenchi looks out to the star filled
sky from his bedroom window.  <Man, today was really
hectic.  First Ladies Funaho and Misaki made me do a
fashion show for them on the different garments they
selected for me.  Then after a quick lunch, they
began to teach me about the history, government,
politics, and royal family responsibilities of Jurai. 
And later during dinner, I received one of many
lessons on etiquette.  I've been kept so busy
throughout the day that I never had a chance to look
for Ryoko.  I was hoping she would show up by now so I
could tell her the reason behind my decision.  And I
also wanted to propose to her. >  Tenchi softly
whispers, "I'm sorry Ryoko, please come back I miss
you", as a tear escapes his eye.  As he falls asleep,
Tenchi begins to dream of Ryoko and the moments he had
spent with her.  Starting with the moment he relesed
her from the cave up to yesterday when she ran out of
the house crying.  At that same moment, Ryoko is also
dreaming of Tenchi as she sleeps within one of the
cells in Azusa's ship.  And as if by instinct or
chance, they both say each other's name as they wake
up and look at the moon and remember their first kiss.

*******************************************************

"Emperor Azusa, the transport ship has just arrived
within the sol system.  We are making preparations for
an exchange by the sixth planet."
"Excellent, proceed with your task and inform me when
the transition has been completed."
"Yes your majesty."
<Excellent, all is going according to plan.  Ayeka
only needs to marry that boy and I will be in complete
control of him.  Now, to take care of one little
problem. >
"Azaka and Kamadake."
"Yes your majesty."
"I need you to take care of one small problem."
"Of course your majesty."
"You are to seal the portal to Washu's lab until I say
other wise.  Use any means necessary to accomplish
this and make sure no one goes in, especially Tenchi."
"Yes Sir!"

*******************************************************

As the Emperors' ship begins to move towards its
rendezvous sight, Ryoko is awakened by a familiar
voice.
"Miya, miya, miya."
"Ryo-Ohki."
"Miya."
"Ryo-Ohki, what are you doing here?"
"Miya, miya, miya, miya."
"Jurai!?  Why would they be taking me over there?"
"Miya!!!"
"What!!!   They're going to execute me!  Why?"
"Miya, miya, miya."
"Attempting to kill Ayeka, they must be joking."
"Miya."
"Ryo-Ohki, you've got to get me out of here."
"Miya, miya, miya, miya, miya, miya."
"You're spending to much time with Washu that you are
starting to sound like her."
"Miya."
"Well if you can't get me out go and get Tenchi before
it's too late."
"Miya, miya, miya, miya."
"You need a diversion.  Don't worry, I'll make one
just get to Tenchi's fast."

*******************************************************

Within moments the ship is rocked by an explosion.
"What the hell was that!?  Did someone fire at us?" 
Yelled the Captain as he tried to get back on his
seat.
"Sir the explosion was not from outside but from
within the ship.  To be more precise from Ryoko's
cell."
"What!?  Send all troops to secure that area and make
sure that she does not escape!"
While the crew is occupied with Ryoko's escape
attempt, Ryo-Ohki is able to get off the ship and fly
towards Earth undetected.
"Sir, the troop Commander reports that the prisoner
did not get out of her cell.  But she was able to blow
up the cell door.  Luckily the prison forcefields were
activated before she was able to step out."
"Good, inform the Commander that all troops are to
remain on full alert until she is transfered onto the
other ship."
"Yes sir."
"Now, lets get her to that other ship asap."

*******************************************************
(Washu's lab)
Washu wakes up from her nap as one of her alarms goes
off.
"What's going on?"
Immediately she starts typing into her laptop and
views the information as it scrolls in her transparent
screen.  As she reads the information detailing the
movement on the Emperor's ship she receives a vital
communication from Ryo-Ohki.  Without hesitation
she runs to inform Tenchi about Ryoko's situation.
<Those bastards, I've lost one child before and I do
not plan to stand idly by and lose another.>
When she reaches the portal door, Washu is shocked to
see that it is blocked by a forcefield.  After a quick
inspection she finds the source behind the forcefield.
"Azaka, Kamadake what is the meaning of this!"
"We are very sorry Professor Washu, but the Emperor
has given us strict orders to keep you inside."
"Let me out of here you two!  I have to tell Tenchi
that Ryoko is in danger!"
"We are sorry Professor but we can not."
<Damit, this shield is exactly like a two-way mirror. 
I can open the door and see out of my lab but no one
can see in.  This also prevents me from being heard,
no matter how loud I yell.  Only one thing left I can
do for now.>
'Ryo-Ohki, I've been locked inside my lab.  It's up to
you to inform Tenchi any way you can.  I'll try to get
out of here but it will take some time.'
'Miya.'
