Author's notes:  That was fun.  Ayeka and Misa are the violent ones and
Ryoko is the peaceful one.  I realize I didn't do much with Sasami.  Oh,
well.  But, that'll change.  BTW, starting in this part, the Mirror
Universe group will have 'Mirror' in front of their names to avoid
confusion.  But, this is only when counterparts meet.

Tenchi Muyo!:  Mirror Image

Chapter two

==========

        Everyone woke with extreme disorientation, some even nausea.  After a
minute, it all cleared.  As they stood, they could see they were in the
woods.

        "Washu!" Ayeka roars, "what did you do now!"

        "Actually, I was trying to get rid of you three."

        "Why?" asks Sasami.  "We were having fun."

        "At my expense," Tenchi replies.

        Sasami pulls him down to her eye level, "come on.  Have a better sense
of humor, will ya?"

        "He has to have a backbone first," Ayeka adds.

        "He was just fine before you showed up," Ryoko says.

        "Okay, Washu," Tenchi starts, "Where are we?"

        Washu, eyeing the house, "Ryoko, why don't you go into the house?  See
if anyone's home."

        "Sure," she says, disappearing.

==========

        Ryoko phases into the house to see everyone indeed is home.  Although,
everyone is acting different.  <Those Juraians are actually nice to him?
Must be a different dimension.>  Looking at her duplicate, <and I'm the
trouble maker?>

        Before she disappears, she notices one thing different.  Looking next
to Misa, Ryoko sees a maroon haired girl sitting next to Misa.  <Misa
had a daughter?> she wonders, phasing out.

        Meeting the others, Ryoko sees what she expected to see.  Washu is out
cold, and Tenchi is tied up.  "Hey!  Behave, would you?"  Using her beam
sword, she slices the ropes.  "I can't leave you, can I?"

        Misa and Ayeka look at each other, "no."

        Washu wakes up.  "Be glad I'm not a nutcase anymore."  Thinking, "then
again," she presses a button on her transparent laptop and all three
Juraian girls turn into water sprites.

        "What happened?"  Ryoko asks.

        "All three jumped me."  Looking at the trio, "four hours!"  The three
immediately start to whine.    "What did you find out?" Washu asks.

        "Well, everyone's home.  But, the Juraians are nice to Tenchi for
once."

        "Unusual, to say the least."

        "Not as unusual as to see Misa with a child."

        "Misa?  A mother?  This MUST be a different dimension."

        Ayeka stops whining to listen.  <I have a plan.  If those people in
that house are taken out, we can get a foot hold in this dimension.
Father should enjoy this.>

==========

        Four hours pass, and Washu decides to keep her word this time.  The
trio are returned to normal, or what passes for it.

        Ayeka then talks to Misa and Sasami alone.  Walking into the woods, "we
can get our foot in the door here.  If we take these versions of us out,
we can easily start to conquer this alternate dimension."

        "Yeah!" Sasami exclaims.  "Father would love that!"

        "But, how would we get home?" Misa asks.

        "We can get this dimension's Washu to help on that," Ayeka explains.

        "Sounds good," Misa says.  "I think we got a plan."

        As the three talk, they don't know that their conversation is being
heard by a third party.  "Miya." she silently says.

==========

        Ryo-Ohki runs back to Ryoko to tell her what she's seen.  "Meow, meow,
meow."

        "Those Juraians are planning an attack.  We gotta stop them."

        "It might help if you made first contact with the others."

        "Right.  I'm on my way."

==========

        Phasing back into the house, she sees her alternate walking near her.
Hiding around the corner, she waits for Ryoko to pass.  Seeing Ryoko
pass, she appears behind her.  Grabbing her waist and mouth, Mirror
Ryoko teleports them out.

        Landing on the roof, "listen very carefully.  Six of us are here from
an alternate dimension.  Actually, it's the same six that are here now,
except for the child.  But, I don't want any screaming when you see me,
alright?"

        Nodding, Ryoko agrees, and is let go.  Looking at her counterpart, "now
I've seen everything.  Are you some kind of imposter?"

        Holding up her left wrist, the gem starts to glow.  "What do you
think?"

        "I think I drank too much sake."

        "You don't believe me?"

        Seeing her gem glow as well, "so, why take me up here?"

        "To avoid the others.  What would you do if you saw two Ayekas?"

        "Look, one's bad enough.  But, you do have a point.  So, tell me about
your dimension.  Is it different than this one?"

        "Yes, very.  For one thing, Ayeka is more of a pain to Tenchi than you
are."

        "I am not a pain.  I just do that to annoy Ayeka."

        "In my world, she's constantly trying to hurt him.  I'm the only one
that can protect him."

        "What about Misa and Sasami?"

        "They're on Ayeka's side."

        "Sasami?  A bad girl?"

        "Yes, she is.  But, I think I know a way to turn her around."

        "And Misa?"

        "She's too far gone.  You see, besides protecting Tenchi, I am also
trying to turn Sasami around.  But, with Ayeka and Misa around, I
haven't had much luck."

        "So, why did you want to meet me?"

        "The Juraians are going to try and fight this dimension's counterparts.
If we do clash, there will be trouble.  But, if we work together, we can
end it."

        "Why does Ayeka want to do that?  Is she that evil?"

        "Yes, she is.  Jurai is power hungry and would enjoy taking control of
its cross-dimension counterpart."

        "So, what do I do?"

        "WE warn your friends.  And when the time comes, we take Ayeka and Misa
down."  Looking at her wrist, she wonders about something.  <Can you
hear me?> Mirror Ryoko says telepathically.

        <Yes, I can.  It seems we can 'hear' each other.>

        "That's one advantage we have.  Now, we should warn your friends."

==========

        Inside, Ryoko returns to the others at the table.  "I got some weird
stuff to tell you.  So, listen up.  First, I want to introduce you to
someone."

        "Who?" asks Sasami.

        Stepping out from the stairs, "me," says Mirror Ryoko.

        Everyone looks at Ryoko and then at Mirror Ryoko.

        "Ryoko," Ayeka starts, "we know you can make a copy of yourself."

        In response, a second Ryoko forms next to the original.  "Yes, but only
one," says the double, before vanishing.

        "Look, it seems we have doubles of all of us running around," Ryoko
explains.

        "Where are they from?" Washu asks.

        "A different dimension," Mirror Ryoko states.  "But, they are much
different than you.  Ayeka, Misa, and Sasami are bad girls.  And I am a
freedom fighter, not a pirate."

        "So, what are you doing here?" Misa asks.

        "Washu attempted to send them away when the three pulled us with them."

        "What do they want?" Tenchi inquires.

        "The Juraians want to take out this dimension's counterparts.  After
that, they can take over this universe."

        "That was foolish," a voice says behind her.

        Ryoko looks back, "Ayeka!"

        Mirror Ayeka, Misa and Sasami are standing together with Tenchi and
Washu in tow.  "Now, we'll have to take you out, too."

        "You tried before and failed," Mirror Ryoko states.

        "True.  But, if you fight with us, your beloved Tenchi won't get hurt.
Fight against us," Ayeka forms a field around Tenchi, "and I'll kill
him."

        Sasami looks up at Tenchi.  "What's going on?"

        "I really don't know, Sasami.  But, it looks like we have a fight on
our hands."
