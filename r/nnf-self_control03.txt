	Tenchi awoke feeling the weight of
the newly-transformed Tsunami/Sasami on
top of him.  She looked so beautiful like
that.  She slept in silence, with the 
exception of her breathing.  She shifted
slightly, and awoke.  Sasami found Tenchi
looking into her eyes as she awoke.
	Tenchi smiled brightly at her.
"Ohayo, Sasami."
	"Ohayo, Ten-chan."
	"Sleep well?"
	Sasami pointedly looked at Tenchi
and where she had fallen asleep last night.
"You bet."
	She slid off of Tenchi to the 
right.  Tenchi grasped her and got a quick
kiss from those voluptuous lips before she
got off.  "I'd better go make breakfast,"
she sighed.
	"Breakfast?  More like lunch," 
said Tenchi, gesturing to his alarm clock.
	Sasami looked over at the clock,
and gasped.  "Oh!  I hope Jiichan and
Nobuyuki aren't mad," she said.
	Sasami then realized she didn't
have any clothes.  "Umm..." she said.
	Sasami left the room a few 
minutes later clad in one of Tenchi's
shirts and no pants at all.  The shirt
covered enough of her so she could run
down the hall and get one of Aeka's 
robes.
	All the other women woke up
in turn.  Kiyone was the first one to
wake up, and she gave Tenchi a kiss.
She found her casual clothes by the
door where she'd stripped.  "Where's
Sasami?" she questioned.
	"Oh, she had to run out to 
her room and get some robes to wear
from Aeka's stash," said Tenchi.
	Kiyone nodded and then left
the room.  Tenchi watched her as 
she left, noting the way her hips
rocked back and forth....
	Ryoko woke up next, and clung
to Tenchi, frenching him and groping
all over.  She left him stunned and
still on the bed, as she left to go
get something to eat.  Aeka woke up
after Ryoko, and gave Tenchi a rather
shallow kiss.  But he wouldn't allow
for that, and pulled her in close, 
giving her the mouth-to-mouth 
treatment.
	Aeka went out the door looking
a little dazed.  Washu walked up to
Tenchi after Aeka, and showed him
her expertise in the matter.  She
also presented a jar containing the
'sample' she'd been wanting.  Tenchi
looked at her, feeling a little 
betrayed, but she just smiled and
didn't say a word.  	
	Mihoshi was still asleep
by the time Tenchi left to go get
some food.  He was still very tired
after six sessions last night, each
one varied, and in Ryoko and Washu's
case, more than once.  <I guess it
runs in the family,> he thought.
	Nobuyuki had met up with
him to give him some congratulations
and some advice, which Tenchi told
him he had some catching up to do.
When Nobuyuki looked at him 
questioningly, Tenchi described to 
him the various techniques Ryoko
and Washu both knew, and Nobuyuki
whipped out a notebook and started
writing those down.
	He progressed into the 
kitchen, where he was met by six
loving stares, and by one serious
face.  Katsuhito was there, looking
at him in a way Tenchi couldn't 
figure out.  It looked somewhat
stoic, and yet, angry. 
	Tenchi left that subject
alone, and sat at the table.  
Sasami had prepared lunch quickly,
because she'd been a little late
to that, too.  Ryoko sat munching
on a sweet potato, and Aeka sat
across the table from her, eating
as well.  Aeka smiled at Tenchi,
and tenchi smiled back, thinking,
<That was pretty much one-sided
last night.>
	Ryo-ohki was on Sasami's
shoulder, and gave a happy Miya.
It was then that Tenchi realized
he had to go out and get the 
fields tended.  He grabbed a 
quick lunch, and went to the
fields, taking one sweet potato
with him.
	Aeka and Ryoko finished
eating, and Aeka cleaned the 
table and helped Sasami wash
the dishes.  Ryoko went to the
TV and popped in a nearby tape
of some romance.
	Aeka came in a few 
minutes later and sat down, 
followed by Kiyone and Sasami,
and then after another five 
minutes, by Mihoshi.
	Aeka started the conversation.
"So, how did everyone fare last night?"
	Ryoko piped in,"I fared the
best, I think."
	Sasami just blushed, thinking
about the events of last night.  Of
course, though, Aeka made her tell
what she felt about what had happened,
and how good Tenchi was.
	"Well," started Sasami.  "I
think it was wonderful.  Of course,
you other ladies had Tenchi really 
tired out by the time I got to him,
though."
	Mihoshi said,"What did we do
to tire him out?"
	Everyone facefaulted.
	"I think Tenchi liked me the
most in bed," said Kiyone, playing 
along.  
	Washu popped out from her lab.
"I think my extensive library of many
and various techniques had him reeling.
And I still managed to get that sample
I'd been wanting."
	Ryoko said,"Well, *mom*, I think
he liked me the most!"
	"You know," started Washu.  "All
the techniques you know are there 'cause
I programmed them into you."
	Ryoko grumbled.
	They continued to watch the steamy
romance film that Ryoko had popped in the
VCR.  It was about a man who thought he
was lucky for having one wife that loved
him very much.  But later on, he lost that
one, and then gained three that made good
love, but never truly loved him in their
hearts.
	About when the part where the man
lost the good wife, Mihoshi started bawling
over it.  Kiyone pressed a hand to her own
forehead and sighed.  Sasami passed the box
of tissues.  Tenchi came in the back door,
looking rather sweaty and dirty.  
	"I'm going to take a bath," he called
out, before ducking into the onsen door.
	Choruses of "I'm coming with you,"
were soon heard, along with Mihoshi's steady
bawling.  Washu had recently corrected the
door so it allowed Tenchi and all the women
to enter the women's bath.  Nobuyuki had 
followed close behind Tenchi, but when
he opened the door, all he saw was the men's
bath.  "Aww..." he mumbled.
	Tenchi took the towel off and settled
into the bath's steamy water.  He then realized
which bath he was in.  "Huh?  Must be Washu's
doing," he said, his voice echoing.
	Of course, it was but a few seconds
later that almost all the women came through
the door.  Tenchi's nose bled at the sight
of them disrobing in front of him.  Ryoko
saw the blood.
	"Oh, get over it, already," she sighed.
	Aeka, however, was reveling in being
able to now do this without embarrassment.
She settled down near Tenchi and hugged him.
Sasami came in also, and sat near Tenchi.
Everyone was no more than two feet away from
Tenchi.  He sank down into the water, but then
propped himself back up, remembering what had
happened last time he allowed himself to go
down.  Tenchi didn't think he could handle
that again, especially after all that yard 
work he had done.
	Every one of the women requested
that they wash Tenchi, and vice versa.  He
sweatdropped, but felt that he should compy,
or risk some punishment at Aeka and Kiyone's
hands.  Kiyone had studied under Aeka for a
while now, and Tenchi had never known, so 
she had a whip and leather outfit, and was
well-educated in the matter.
	Mihoshi was still out in the living
room bawling over that film, so she still
wasn't in the bath.  Tenchi had to wash
everyone, front and back, and he was washed
six times as well.  He had to swallow his
embarrassment and go along with it.
	After all that, Tenchi was the 
cleanest thing that ever existed.  He was
perfectly clean and smelling very fresh.
He was also blushing.  So after their bath,
Tenchi decided that he wanted to go to the
mall.  
	Nobuyuki had some trouble trying
to cram all of them into the van, but they
made it out to the mall.  At first, they 
all stuck around with Tenchi, inspiring
many people to gawk at the way they all
fawned over him.  A few guys walked by
and stared, causing their girlfriends to
give them a solid slap across the face to
remind them who's boss.
	But after going past a few stores,
the women began to peel off and check out
a few of them.  Nobuyuki handed Tenchi his
credit card with a few words on not to
spend too much, and then took off to a 
movie.  Tenchi went in to a bookstore and
looked at a few of the manga in stock.
	Aeka was off at the jewelry, 
admiring a tiara that was there, as well
as a few necklaces.  Nothing was made of
platinum as she had hoped, but it all had
a charm of its own.  She especially admired
a locket that was there, and pointed it 
out to the clerk.  "Yes ma'am, how may
I help you?"
	"I would like that locket there, 
with an engraving on it if you may."
	The clerk handed her a sheet of
paper.  "Write what you want printed
on the locket here, and I can get it 
done quickly." 
	Aeka wrote in the best handwriting
she had, and the clerk had the word,"Tenchi"
engraved on it.
	"That will be 13,456 yen, please."
	Aeka fished out some yen and paid
the clerk for her locket.  She then left
the store looking for Tenchi so she could
display her new trinket.
	Ryoko was in the lingerie department
of another store, trying to find something
she thought would impress Tenchi.  There
were several lacy things she had thought
on, but none of them seemed to suit her
very well, or so she thought. 
	Until her eyes came across a piece
of cotton that couldn't have been legal
in some countries, which she snatched up
instantly.  She didn't have much yen,
but enough to pay for a couple inches
of cotton.
	Kiyone didn't have much yen at
all, yet, so she wasn't sure on what
she could afford.  But in the bookstore
she was able to find Tenchi, and a 
book on criminals and other law-associated
things.  Tenchi saw her in the checkout
line for that book, and he used the 
credit card to purchase it for her.
	Mihoshi just loitered around for
a while, until she happened across a candy
shop.  "Ooh, those bon-bons look delicious!"
she whispered to herself.  So she forked
out a few yen and bought a box of them to
snack on when she got home.  So she started
to look for Tenchi.
	Sasami had gone to the same clothing
store that Ryoko did, because she needed 
some new ones.  Of course, she happened
across the lingerie just like Ryoko did.
Sasami blushed, but still chose out a few
pieces for herself.  She had to have some
of that too, you know.
	Washu had stepped into one of those
science stores, but was quickly bored with
the primitive trinkets and little things
like that.  So she stepped into a pet
store to observe some of the local fauna.
Washu happened across a rabbit cage.  She
looked at them for a while, and petted a
few, but found them uninteresting compared
to her much superior Ryo-ohki. 
	Still nothing interested her.  It
was just too primitive.  Giving up, she
made her way back to Tenchi, who was now
sitting at a bench outside of the theater,
waiting for his dad to come out.
	Within a half-hour, all the women
had found him and were waiting as well.
Another half-hour later, the movie was
over and Nobuyuki came out.  He drove 
them all back home.  
	When they got back home, Sasami
had to go make supper, and when she was
done, they sat down and ate.  Aeka 
flaunted her locket, which she had put
a picture of her and Tenchi inside of.
	Mihoshi started eating the
bon-bons after supper.  And Tenchi 
decided to retire early.  Of course,
all the women wanted to, as well, and
went with him.  Tenchi had just gotten 
his shirt off when.."Tenchiiiii..." said
Ryoko.  Tenchi turned around, and
she was dressed in the skimpiest piece
of cotton he'd ever seen.  Blood shot
from his nose on sight.
	The bra and panties left almost
nothing to the imagination.  Of course,
as he was staring at that, Aeka grabbed
him from behind.  Instantly, Tenchi 
knew she wasn't wearing any clothes,
and he sweated.  It appeared he had no
choice in the matter.
	Aeka shoved him on the bed,
and leapt on top of him.  Ryoko
protested, "Hey, you got him first
the last time!" but she couldn't 
peel Aeka off of him.  So she pouted as
they got down to business.  Mihoshi
and Kiyone came in a moment later,
both disapponted at seeing Aeka had
gotten to Tenchi first again.
	Sasami came in later, knowing
she wouldn't be able to get to him first
this time.  And Washu came in last, 
figuring she would be the best as she
thought she was, and being last would
suit her.  Of course, Tenchi got to 
all of them in turn, so no one lost
out in the end.  All in all, the day
had been a pretty business-as-usual
type of day, and he couldn't help
but wonder how long that would last...
	The next morning, Tenchi woke
up earlier than before.  But all the
women had already woke up and were
out the door.  But as he began to 
open the door, it slapped him in the
face as all the women came back in.
They all looked at him, and then
each other for a moment.
	"Um, Tenchi?" began Aeka.
	"I am....that is to say, we
are all....pregnant."
	Tenchi looked at her like he
hadn't heard what she'd said.  She
repeated herself twice more, and then
went over to Tenchi.  She touched him,
and he toppled over, eyes still open.
	"Oh, dear," she said.
(^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^_^)
So, what did you think of that chapter?
I know, I know, a bit sudden with the 
pregnancies, but I thought it was the only
thing I could put in to spice it up.
