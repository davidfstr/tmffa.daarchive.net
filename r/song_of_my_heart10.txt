with me owning Tenchi.... ((just in case 1 of you readers didnt know, all of my 
disclaimers are jokeing, Tenchi Muyo belongs to AIC and Pioneer not me, but i 
figure i've done good if I can make you laugh!)

my lazy butt in gear...  -.-;  but hey, I am the original lazy bum! er.... i was 
jokeing... why are you all nodding..... um... well... on with the story!

Song of My Heart: Perfect

	Hotsuma ran through the woods, he saw Ryoko fall and he saw someone else, 
walking twords her, then there was a flash, and the fire seemed to cease, but 
Ryoko was gone, and the other person was no where either.
	"No...." He said  quietly, the one person in the Masaki home who treeted 
him like a person was gone...gone.

	Ryoko opened her eyes, she had fallen into a dreamless sleep, but was once 
again awake. Her mind still raceing with thoughts, but her headache  gone.  She 
sat up and looked down, she apeared to be wearing a dark blue midevil style 
dress (A/N- Go to this adress to see a pic of the dress exept for Ryoko's is 
dark blue instead of red:

disgust, for that wasn't what she was wearing when she had fallen asleep.
	"Sick freek...." she mumbled quietly. "How dare he.... for his information 
I can change my own clothes..."\
	"But you were soaked and asleep, darling..... you look lovely, that dress 
suits you perfectly... exept for one thing... your hair... tsk..... hm.... we'll 
have to do something with it so you'll look suitable...." came Taro's voice from 
the door.
	"Hey wait a second.... darling? suitable? what's wrong with my hair?! Who 
are you anyway...." Ryoko said confused.
	"My name is Taro, and you... you are now.... my one and only..... hm 
perhaps a bun... yes, perfect..." he said going back to the subject of her hair.
	"Your one and only?!!? I don't even know you! hey! that hurts!" she said 
as a ribbon apeared and he started pulling her hair into it, and into a tight 
bun.
	"Perfect... absolutely lovely..." He said as he finished and stepped back 
and took a look at Ryoko, who quietly glared at him. "Now... you are 
perfect...." he whispered to himself.

	Back at the Masaki home chaos raged.
	"What happened?? what did you see!?!?" Washu asked Hotsuma trying to stay 
calm.
	Mihoshi was crying loud enough to break windows, and Kiyone screamed at 
her to shut up before she did so. Ayeka sat on the couch, hed sown, quietly 
laughing, everyone thought she was crying.
	"It's ok Ayeka... I'm sure Ryoko is ok.... I know you too were 
friends...." Sasami said quietly,patting Ayeka on the back.
	*Yes of course Sasami..... friend..... right...* Ayeka thought with  a 
mental grin *Tenchi's mine now either way.... how perfect....*
