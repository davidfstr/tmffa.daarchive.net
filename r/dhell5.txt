The Darkest Hell 5 : Bounty of the heart

	"GO FASTER!"  shouted the copilot of the ship Leo-oki. 
The jet black ship soared faster and faster as a massive,
black, alien ship blasted at the immensely smaller ship.  

	"SHIT"  screamed the copilot again.  "Leo-oki! 
FASTER!"

	"ErrrrroooAAAARRR"  roared Leo-oki loudly, totally
atypical of the entire race of cabbit/ star ships.  Leo-oki
began to glow deep blue and then, in a blink of an eye, was
gone.

	Leo-oki finally reappeared light years away, near the
other end of the galaxy.  The pilots of the ships breathed a
sigh of relief.  

	"GODDAMN IT, Matsui!  What the HELL was THAT?"  

	Matsui just shrugged in response.  The other pilot
rolled his eyes at Matsui and pulled a mini-cigar.  He put
it up to his lips.

	"I'm mean, shit man!  We almost got FRIED back there. 
What the hell happened to you?  You just freaking blacked
out there!  Talk to me, bitch!"  screamed the copilot, the
mini-cigar dangling from his lips.  The pilot, Matsui, just
sat there, a sullen look on his young face.  The other pilot
sighed and put a finger up to the tip of the mini-cigar.  He
then quickly moved his finger away, igniting it.  They just
sat there for a few minutes, flying Leo-oki to parts unknown
when suddenly, a figure crept up behind them, a long laser
staff, not unlike Ryoko's laser sword, but much longer,
glowing from it's hands.  A look of pure anger flooded the
figures fair features.

	"Took you long enough, Gillian.  What the hell happened
to you?" the copilot said, surprising the figure behind him,
known as Gillian.  Gillian finally stepped into the light
and revealed a VERY lovely young woman, who had a cute, yet
unusual, cleft to her nose.  

	"You BASTARD!  I told you to TELL me if anything like
that was gonna happen!  Geez Togusa!  You scared me half to
death.  Hi, Matsui."  Answered Gillian, the young woman's
long deep blue hair dangled mere inches off the ground.  She
bared her fangs and pulled her hair around her long pointed
ears.  Her eyes burned red, but faded to a pale blue as she
calmed down.  She stood in between Togusa and Matsui.  Her
hand went up on Matsui's shoulder.

	"Hey... are you alright?  You took a nasty spill back
there."

	Slowly, Matsui nodded.  Gillian's eyes glowed purple
with concern.  Togusa just stared out into space, trying to
figure out where the hell they were.  He then noticed Matsui
reach up to several of the crystal spheres in the middle of
Leo-oki's bridge.  He touched them and they started to glow. 
Without warning, hundreds of navigational charts and
monitors showing various star systems popped up.  Finally,
Leo-oki let loose a small purr-like growl as a monitor
showed them where they were to go.

	"Jurai?  Why Jurai?  Don't you think that place is a
little too hot for people of our occupation?" asked Togusa,
his green eyes eyeing his brother curiously.  Matsui nodded
his head and pointed toward the monitor.  Suddenly, words
flashed by.

	WE MUST GO.  SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.  I HEARD
THE SCREAMS OF MILLIONS.  THEY NEED OUR HELP.

	"Wait, wait, wait.  You want us to do some CHARITY
work?  CHARITY?  US?  Boy, you DID take a heavy blow to the
head.  Hah, charity work, hilarious!"  laughed Togusa.

	"Come on, Togusa.  You need to make nice with the
Juraian government.  Remember that one job you two pulled
several hundred years back?"

	They both nodded.  Matsui reached up and felt his
throat.  A long jagged scar ran its course all around his
neck.

	"Come on.  Have a heart.  Besides, the Juraian
government is the richest, most powerful government in the
universe.  There might be some heavy compensation in it for
ya."  Said Gillian, her now pink eyes pleading.

	"But... oh, alright, fine.  I'm a sucker for a pretty
face.  Make way to Jurai, and make it quick.  I'm gonna
catch some shut-eye."  Answered Togusa as he walked off the
raised platform in the center of Leo-oki's bridge and out of
sight of the other two.  

	"You owe me one, squirt." Replied Gillian, as she
playfully knocked on Matsui's head.  Matsui just smiled and
mouthed the words : 'Thanks.'

	"Don't mention it.  Try to get some sleep.  Oh, and
Leo-oki, try not to get picked up by the GP.  I don't want
to have to meet up with good 'ol dad again."

	"Grrrr..." answered Leo-oki.  

	Then, just like Togusa, Gillian walked off the platform
and out of sight.  Matsui stood there, all alone.  Silently,
he put two small orbs into his ears and pressed a small
button on a little black box strapped onto his side. 
Immediately, loud alien music, the deep space equivalent of
rock 'n' roll, began to play.  Matsui sat down, lotus style
and shut his green eyes.  He then slept.

************************************************************

	"Princess, wake up!"  Shouted Ryoko, as she slapped
Ayeka repeatedly.  Still, Ayeka showed no signs of waking
up.

	"Here, try this."  said Washu as she gave Ryoko a small
foul smelling tube.  Ryoko turned her head slightly in
disgust as she began to wave the tube under the princesses
nose.  Finally, she began to stir. 

	"Thank God... AAAAAHHHH"  shouted Ryoko as Ayeka
lurched upright, scaring her.  

	"Oh, NO!  It wasn't a dream!  Jurai is REALLY gone!" 
Ayeka uttered, still groggy from having fainted.  She
lowered her head in sadness a second later. " I thought it
was all just a dream, and I would wake up, and Tenchi would
be there and so would Jurai."

	"Well, I'm sorry princess.  I don't know what to say. 
But I do know what we should do.  We gotta get the HELL out
of here before those Dark Juraians come back."

	"You mean you want us to run AWAY?!  We should be
planning a counter strike!"

	"Yeah, a lot of good your last one did..."  muttered
Washu sarcastically.  

	"What did you say!?"  growled Ayeka.

	"Stop it you two, your senseless bickering isn't going
to bring Jurai back."  interjected Funhao.  

	"Yes... stop.  We... must...oh, god..." attempted
Misaki to reinforce what Funhao just said.  But she failed,
and broke down into tears again.  A deep silence filled the
room.  It was eventually broken by Kiyonne's upset voice, as
she hailed Ryo-oki.

	"What just happened here!?"  wondered Kiyonne.

	"What does it LOOK like?"  returned Ryoko, her face
riddled with anger.  

	"My god... what are we dealing with...?"  whispered
Kiyonne to herself.  

	"Hey, where's Mihoshi?"  asked Washu in order to break
up the tension.

	"She ran to her quarters.  She couldn't understand what
was happening, so she ran off, crying."

	"Oh..." said Washu somberly.  

	"We need to go someplace quiet to figure out what
happened and what our next move will be..." Kiyonne
mentioned, trying to get things started again.  

	"She right." Ryoko added.  "We should head to Rigal. 
That place is uninhabited and'll make for a good place to
rest up.  We need it."

	"Fine."  Said Ayeka, upset at the fact that they will
not go and at least attempt to destroy the enemy that had
stolen so much from them.  

	"Alright, Ryo-oki.  You heard Kiyonne.  Let's get
moving."  Said Ryoko, with only a fraction of her old self
barely poking through.

	"Meow."  Returned Ryo-oki.  The group felt themselves
lurch forward somewhat as Ryo-oki began to move forward. 
After doing a loop, Ryo-oki zoomed off to the planet of
Rigal, unaware of a similar jet black ship rocketing close
behind, undetected. 

************************************************************

	Days later, the entire reminisce of the Juraian fleet
made it to the Rigal system, and to the planet that shared
it's name.  The twin suns of Rigal shone brightly in the
mountainous regions of the isolated planet, thick with trees
and beauty.  A small town was eventually constructed out of
the vast resources of the planet.  Life, at least for now,
was comfortable.  Even some roaming merchants set up shop in
the shanty town, hoping to make a buck, attempting to sell
all sorts of different exotic items.  Ryoko didn't give a
crap about any of it.  She WAS happy, although, about the
small bar that had opened up. 'Hell, in times of crisis, I
could always count on the sake to take me away from all my
troubles.  At least that's something no one can take away
from me...' she thought as she once again entered the bar
that she so often frequented.  The place was nearly empty,
except for three people.  She barely opened the door when
Ryo-oki, in her cabbit form, bounded in.  She came to a
screeching halt as she entered the bar and sniffed the air. 
She stuck her nose to the ground and began to walk off,
following some sort of scent.  Shrugging, Ryoko walked up to
the bar and noticed the bartender wasn't there.  'Oh, good,
free sake.'  Thought Ryoko as she dematerialized and reached
under the bar, pulling up a large bottle of sake.  She
opened it and began to chug it, not even looking for a
glass.  When she drank a few gulps, she opened her mouth and
let loose a refreshed "Ahh".  She then noticed the small
puff of smoke that flew out into the air.  

	"Damn, this is good stuff..."  commented Ryoko.  Then
she heard someone set down there glass, and she also felt
several eyes on her.

	"Well, god damn, if it ain't Ryoko!  It's been, well,
ages."  Commented a stranger sitting to her right.  She
turned her head to see two very familiar faces.  A flash of
memories flooded her mind.  Memories of meeting two up and
coming Space Pirates / Bounty Hunters while she was under
Kagato's control.  She remembered that they raided his ship
one day when he was absent and stole a shitload of
equipment, including Kagato's little project that he was
spending some spare time on.  She never found out what it
was, but she new it wasn't horribly important to Kagato, for
he didn't spend too much time on it.

	"What the... YOU!?" Ryoko answered, surprised.  She
turned to see the smiling faces of Togusa and Matsui.  On
Matsui's shoulder rested a most peculiar creature, like that
of a cabbit, but more cat-like and feral.  Around his head
was a large mass of loose, fluffy hair, like a mane.  The
creature stared at her with eyes as black as the rest of its
body.  

	"I thought you'd be dead by now, or arrested!" she
continued.

	"What, US?  Come ON Ryoko!  We are the greatest bounty
hunters in the universe!  We just can't lose!"  beamed
Togusa proudly.  His little self-indulging speech was
interrupted by Matsui, who looked at his brother and began
to mouth some words.  Ryoko strained to hear what he was
saying, only to realize that he wasn't saying anything. 
Then she noticed the scar, and knew why.  

	"HA!  Your kidding!  Ryoko, my brother says you've been
bunking on some little planet called Earth!  Is that true? 
Where the HELL is that, anyway... the SOL SYSTEM!?  Where's
that!?"  exclaimed Togusa as Matsui mouthed words to him
continuously.  Ryoko decided to ignore the two and looked
over to her far right.  She noticed a woman sitting close to
them, drinking a bottle of sake like it was water.  'Now
there is a woman I could get to know.' Thought Ryoko.

	"Hey, Togusa.  Who's that?"  Ryoko inquired.

	"Oh, that's Gillian.  We saved her from a bunch of
whack jobs over in universal sector 82204556.  They tried to
convert her to some crazy cult or something.  Apparently she
knew my brother, but he never told me from where."

	"Oh..." Ryoko thought, then something clicked, "wait,
did you say 'cult'?"

	"Yeah.  But I don't remember which one.  They were a
funky bunch though, I'll give'em credit for that.  But
still, I wouldn't want to meet up with them again.  One ship
nearly fucking KILLED us!  But we were too damn good, right
Matsui?"  returned Togusa.  Matsui just nodded and continued
to drink.  Gillian then moved closer to him.  Ryoko noticed
this and was reminded of the time her and Tenchi were on the
roof, and she was upset over the whole Mayuka business. 
Now, that all seemed trivial to what was happening now. 
Ryoko sighed and chugged her sake again.  Togusa, totally
clueless, lifted his drink into the air, muttered "Cheers!"
and poured it down, smacking his lips loudly afterwards.  

	"Now THAT hits the spot.  Anyway, what're you doing in
this little shit town anyway.  We saw you fly in and
wondered, ' Damn, that looks like Ryo-oki.  I wonder if
that's Ryoko, or are our eyes playing tricks on us?'.  So we
decided to stop by and catch up on old times.  So, how's the
old man?"

	"Old man?"  inquired Ryoko, not sure what the hell he
was babbling about.

	"You know, what's his name, Gato or something."

	"Dead." Answered Ryoko as she took another drink.  She
was beginning to loosen up.  

	"Oh, I'm sorry... I guess."  Answered Togusa, not sure
what to say.

	"Don't be.  He was a megalomaniac and a psychopath.  I
hope he rots in the deepest, darkest hell."  Muttered Ryoko,
drudging up some more old memories of the past, then
realizing that that was where she was, the deepest, darkest
hell.  She took another long, deep drink, finishing the
bottle.  Togusa looked at her, unimpressed.  

	"Hey, if it's a drinking contest you want, I'll be sure
to oblige you.  Just say the word, but we drink what I
choose, not this weak ass sake stuff."

	"I'm not in the mood."  Ryoko growled.

	"Hey, sorry if I pressed some buttons that weren't
supposed to be pressed.  I didn't mean it."

	"Then shut the hell up."  Gillian muttered from off in
the background.

	"Hey, when I want your advise, I'll ask for it, Okay?"

	"Too bad you didn't ask for it last time.  'Oh, look...
I'll press this switch!'" mocked Gillian.

	"Oh, well sorry the piss out of me.  I didn't know that
that stupid freaking switch was a dummy switch!  You're the
one who said to pull it!"

	"I said NOT to pull it.  Are you deaf, or just hard of
hearing?"

	"Ooooh, that is IT!  Your walking home..." 

	The two continued to argue as Ryoko rolled her eyes and
began to walk out of the bar.  She nearly reached the door
when Washu, Kiyonne, and Mihoshi walked in.  

	"Oh, Ryoko!  You're already here!  Great!"  Smiled
Mihoshi in her usual annoying brightness, totally unfazed by
what had happened recently.

	"Yeah, why don't you pull up a seat by the bar and have
a few drinks with us?"  asked Washu politely.  Ryoko began
to say "No thanks", but then Mihoshi grabbed her by the arm
and dragged her toward the bar.

	"Great!  I just thought that you would!"  smiled
Mihoshi as she dragged the groaning space pirate back over
to the bar.  She sat back down as she noticed the fight
between Gillian and Togusa had escalated.

	"Great, this is gonna suck."  Ryoko muttered to herself
as Togusa kicked the chair out from under himself, and
entered a fighting position.  Gillian did the same, her eyes
a shade of deep red.  Ryoko stared at her eyes, finding
something oddly familiar about their color.  Kiyonne, just
barely in time, saw the confrontation out of the corner of
her eye.  She leapt up and ran in between the two.

	"Now listen you two.  This is the only bar in this
little town.  If you destroy it, I know a whole crap load of
guys that'll rip you two apart.  Now let's just settle
down."

	"Not until he apologizes."  Answered Gillian.

	"NOW who's the one being the insensitive prick!?" 
hissed Togusa.

	"Up yours, you little... cretin!"

	"Oh, she called me a cretin!  Oh, how will I ever live
it down!?"  cried Togusa sarcastically as he pranced around
in a small circle.  

	"GRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"  grunted Gillian as she
summoned her laser staff.  

	"Come on, baby.  Let's rock." Returned Togusa as he
summoned a Laser scimitar.  Suddenly, he heard a CLICK.  He
moved his eyes over to his left temple.  Pointed at said
temple was a fairly large alien looking gun.  It whined with
power.  Holding that gun was Matsui.  Togusa gulped as his
laser scimitar faded into the air.

	"S...sorry."  Togusa said quietly, almost inaudible.

	"What was that?  I couldn't hear you!"  gloated
Gillian.

	"Why you little bit..."  Togusa started, but he felt
the nozzle being pressed into his temple even harder, "OKAY
GODDAMNIT!  I SAID I WAS SORRY!  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT FROM
ME, MY FIRST BORN!?!?"  yelled Togusa, scaring everyone with
the volume at which he shouted.  Gillian giggled to herself
a little and nodded at Matsui.  Matsui immediately lowered
the nozzle.  

	"Freaking traitor..." mumbled Togusa as Gillian began
to laugh hysterically.  Matsui failed to see the humor in a
near death situation and sat back down in between his
brother and Gillian.  Togusa slammed Matsui in the shoulder,
and hard.  Matsui mouthed his displeasure toward his
brother, who began to drink again.  Matsui realized that he
was pouting and that he wouldn't talk to him for a few
hours.  'Oh well...' Matsui thought.  He began to drink
also.  Kiyonne, seeing that there wasn't going to be a major
war in front of her, looked at the deep, navy blue haired
woman.  She had a cleft in her nose that Kiyonne thought
looked familiar.

	"Excuse me, miss?  I was just wondering, do you happen
to be related to anyone in the Galaxy police?"  asked
Kiyonne.

	"Yeah, why?  Did my father send you out to look for me,
cause I ain't going back home.  Tell him he can forget it."

	"Was your father Major Mikhal?"

	"Yeah... what do you mean by 'was'?"

	"I've got some bad news..."

	"What...!?"  Gillian asked, her bottom lip quivering.

	"I'm sorry.  Your father...died, a few days ago, during
the battle outside of Jurai.  He asked me to find you.  I
can't begin to say how sorry I am."  Said Kiyonne in her
most sensitive voice.  She then witnessed a miraculous
transformation.  She saw the fiery, red eyed woman-warrior
break down into a weak, sobbing, blue eyed child.  Crying,
Gillian ran out of the bar, soon followed by Matsui, his
face a sheet of worry.  He glared a Kiyonne as he passed by
her.  Kiyonne gulped, knowing that she didn't want to mess
with that one.  Togusa sat there, his mouth ajar.  He seemed
to stare for a few seconds before standing back up.

	"Man, that was low. Now I remember why I hate you
freaking pigs."  Togusa said as he walked out of the bar. 
Kiyonne groaned.  'Why god.  Why can't my life go right for
just once...' she thought as she joined the others.  Mihoshi
gently put her arm around her partner.

	"It's okay, Kiyonne.  I know you did what you had to
do.  Come on, let's have a drink."

	"Yeah.  Let's drown our sorrows.  That goes double for
you, Ryoko."  Interjected Washu.

	"Yeah, fine.  I could use a few more drinks."  Ryoko
muttered lowly, her mood down in the dumps.  For the next
few hours, Ryoko, Washu, Mihoshi, and especially Kiyonne
drank like fish and reminisced about the old times, about
Okayama, and about Tenchi.  After a while, Ryoko just
stopped talking altogether, and eventually excused herself,
stumbling drunkenly to her temporary hut.  The others soon
followed, almost too drunk and tired to make it back.  But,
eventually, they did, and they all drifted into a deep,
intoxicated sleep.  All, that is, except three others...

************************************************************

Gillian ran into the massive, green, plush alien forest. 
The suns have long been gone and the night permeated the
sky.  She ran, crying, until her legs refused to go no
further.  Then, without a single thought, she
instantaneously teleported up to the top of a high tree. 
There, she sat on a branch, against the tree and wept some
more, until she cried her very last tear.  With her highly
sensitive ears, she picked up the sound of leaves rustling. 
She looked around and nearly fell out of the tree when
Matsui mysteriously materialized in front of her.  

"I hate it when you do that."  She joked.  It was a futile,
half-hearted, attempt.  

Matsui waved his right hand around, then made a fist.  Out
of the fist, he pulled a handkerchief, like some magician. 
Gillian chuckled a bit at his attempt to cheer her up, and
gladly took the 'chief.  

"Thanks, little buddy..." she sniffled.  Matsui put on a
fake smile in order to try to cheer her up more, but frowned
when he saw that it was failing.  

"Stop.  You don't have to do that.  I'm gonna be sad for a
while.  You know, I never got to say goodbye?  Our last
words together were spoken in anger and I never saw him
again.  Now I'll never get the chance to say 'I'm sorry,
pop...' and he died thinking I hated him.  Oh, god..."  she
cried as she grasped Matsui and hugged him with a bear hug
that rivaled that of Misaki.  And she continued to cry for
hours and hours, still clinging to Matsui, who never moved
an inch, even though he was standing in thin air. 
Eventually, the sad moment was interrupted by an echoing
voice, ringing through the forested area.  It was Togusa. 
Gillian lifted her tired head and looked in the direction
that he was calling.

"Come on.  We better get back to camp, before Togusa has a
coronary."  Said Gillian as she wiped away the tears. 
Without warning, Gillian felt herself being lifted up as
Matsui slowly floated to the ground far below.  When they
got to the ground, Matsui and Gillian headed back to town,
slowly.  Off in the distance, there was a heavy growl, a
growl that has never been recorded on any world in any
system in any known galaxy in the universe.  And it was
followed by more growls, until the night air was permeated
with a deep bellowing from what seemed the pit of hell
itself...

************************************************************

	Kiyonne tossed and turned in her bed, her mind a jumble
of thoughts and images.  They didn't mean anything at all,
they were just... thoughts and images.  But slowly, a more
defined memory pushed its way into her head.

	"Oh, my GOD!  I'm gonna be LATE!"  shouted Kiyonne as
she ran down the clean hall.  Her long green hair, much
longer than it is now, whipped around as she turned a corner
and almost dove into the class room.  'The first day of the
academy and I was almost late!  Oh, man, this isn't good.' 
She plumeted into her desk and lowered her head in defeat. 
She raised her head a few seconds later and noticed that the
professor wasn't here.

	"Hey, where's the teacher?" asked Kiyonne, turning to
the young woman sitting next to her.  Immediately she
noticed the lack of intelligence in the other woman's eyes.  

	"Who?"  asked the other woman innocently.  Her blonde
hair, which sharply contrasted with her deeply tanned skin,
bounced as she cocked her head in confusion.

	"Nothing..." Kiyonne groaned.

	Suddenly, the professor walked in, his back straight. 
His walk was nearly a march and his uniform was in top notch
condition, even for a Galaxy Police officer.  The entire
class immediately stood up and saluted, except for Kiyonne,
who was a little slow to start.  She was several seconds
late in her saluting, and she caught several glares from her
class mates.  She blushed in embarrassment.  After a while,
Kiyonne noticed the rest of the students sit down, so she
followed suit.  'Oh, man.  This is gonna suck...' she
thought as she raised her head to look at her new professor. 
But, instead of the normal, everyday Galaxy Police
professors that she had heard so much about, she saw what
she defined as the perfect picture of manhood.  He was far
older than her, she could tell, but his face hadn't exceeded
that of around 30 earth years.  His neck was thick, but not
grossly muscular, and his shoulders were straight and broad. 
His chest, although it was covered in the typical high
ranking officer GP uniform, was buff.  He could tell he was
ripped under that uniform, as she tried to picture him
without his shirt on.  She noticed everything else about him
could have been plucked out of her best sexual fantasies,
although he had an unusual cleft in his nose.  'Oh, well,
it's cute' she thought.  She fell instantly in love, and
began to blush.  She then looked around to see if anyone had
noticed, but was caught by surprise when she saw the ratio
of men to women in the class room.  'It's nearly all
women...' she thought to herself.  Then, she noticed in the
back were a few guys, barely anything that she would deem
'good looking.'  She took a deep breath and joined the rest
of her female classmates in staring at the teacher.  

	"Good morning, class, and welcome to the first day of
the rest of your lives.  For the next few years, I will mold
you into the best cadets that the Galaxy police can ever
hope for.  And I'm happy to see that there are more females
turning out in the past few years.  It makes me proud to
know that both sexes are taking consideration in the
intricacies of interstellar federal protection."

	'Yeah, right.'  Though Kiyonne as she guessed at what
the REAL reason all of these women chose this class, or
maybe even JOINED the Galaxy Police.  'Well, I can't really
blame them...' she thought, 'I mean look at him, he's a
GOD!'.  She began to feel herself drool, so she fixed
herself up and opened her notebook.  'These next couple of
years are going to be REALLY hard...' she thought to herself
once again, 'but I think I could get used to it...'

	The next few years seemed to just fly by as Kiyonne
grew in her classroom position.  She quickly became one of
the best officers in training in the academy.  But she
noticed something that hadn't changed, her infatuation with
her teacher.  Finally, graduation day had come upon her, and
her long years of training were finally over.  There was
still something that needed to be done, something that she
had to get off her chest.  Dressed in her graduation
uniform, Kiyonne made her way to her professors quarters.  

	"It's either now or never..." Kiyonne whispered to
herself as she summoned the courage to knock on the door. 
The door slid open to reveal her professor, still in the
middle of getting ready for the ceremony.  His uniform
wasn't tucked in, his tie wasn't straight and he wasn't
wearing any shoes.  Kiyonne just stood there, afraid to do
anything.  She began to breath raggedly.

	"Uh, hi... Kiyonne.  May I... help you?"  asked her
professor curiously.  

	"Uh... hi... heh, heh..." Kiyonne answered nervously.  

	"Do you... want to come in?"  her teacher eventually
asked.

	"S...sure."  Kiyonne stuttered.  She slowly inched her
way into his quarters.  The place was as neat and tidy, just
how he always wore his uniform...most of the time.  She
wandered into the center of the small apartment and
eventually felt her professors hand touch her arm as he
offered her a place to sit.  Kiyonne blushed briefly and
then had a seat on a chair close to his bed, which was where
he was sitting.  

	"May I help you Kiyonne?"  asked her teacher
innocently.  

	"Well," said Kiyonne as she thought of ways to stall,
so that she can pounce when the time was right, "I'm a bit
nervous about this whole graduating thing..." she said,
lowering her head.  

	"What, YOU, Kiyonne?  You were my best student.  You
graduated in the top 1% of your class.  What do you think
you have to be nervous about?" the professor said,
surprised.  Then his expression calmed a bit. " I know
exactly what your feeling."

	"You DO?" Kiyonne asked, as equally surprised, but
lowered her head again when she realized it was about the
nervousness, not the heart-aching love.

	"Oh, yeah.  I went through the same thing when I went
through the academy.  I was entering the big time now, not
some dinky little class.  Hell yeah, I was nervous.  Don't
worry.  I know that you'll become better than this old man."

	"Don't say that!  Your not that old, and nobody can
replace you.  You're... special." Gulped Kiyonne as she
stared into her teachers eyes.  They seemed to change from
dark to light blue.  'That's strange, I never saw that
before...' thought the ardent young girl.  She saw him get a
little nervous as he stood up and walked over to the mirror. 
He began to fumble with his tie.  'Here might be my
opening...' thought Kiyonne.  She stood up and walked over
to the object of her affection.  She didn't even notice the
seductive way she was moving her own hips.  

	"Damn it.  I hate these things.  I can never get them
on... straight." He said as he saw Kiyonne start to mess
with his tie.  He noticed that she had taken her cap off and
let her hair down.  It was shorter now and seemed to get in
the way less than it did before.  Finally, she moved her
hands away from his collar.  He turned to the mirror and
noticed that his tie was perfect.  He smiled.

	"Well, thanks Kiyonne.  You saved me a lot of heartache
and pain."  He said gladly.  His smile made her blush. 
'She's been doing that a lot' the teacher thought to
himself.  Then, something inside his head clicked.  

	"Uh, Kiyonne, you're not here to tell me how nervous
you are about graduation... are you?" finally said.

	Kiyonne felt her heart stop.  It was now or never.  She
decided it was better to get this love off her chest now,
than to conceal it forever.

	"No... I'm sorry, it's just that, ever since I saw you
on that first day, I... well, that is to say..." she
stuttered.

	"That you..." continued the professor, moving his hand
in a circular motion, indicating that he wanted her to spit
it out.

	"Ah, hell." Muttered Kiyonne as she moved up and kissed
him, and kissed him hard.  She moved her hands around his
strong neck and pulled him toward the bed.  She laid down
and pulled him on top of her, continuing to kiss him.  The
professor tried to fight it, but the instinctive part of him
told him, 'NO!  DON'T YOU STUPID DUMB ASS!?  ARE YOU GAY OR
SOMETHING!?'  He began to fight his instincts with common
sense, telling himself of all of the consequences that could
happen, not only to himself, but to Kiyonne, the gentile
young girl trying to get him to make love to her, right now. 
Eventually, he broke their kiss.  Kiyonne looked at him, a
little hurt.  

	"Listen Kiyonne, and listen good.  We cannot, and I
mean CANNOT do this.  I do not want the consequences of our
actions to ruin your career in the Galaxy Police."

	"Wha...what's the matter?  Did I do something wrong?"
Kiyonne asked, almost crying.

	"If falling in love is wrong, than we'd all be locked
up.  But you, unfortunately, fell in love with the worst
person you could fall in love with.  Not only am I your
teacher, but I'm also your superior.  Everyone would suspect
that the only reason you got high marks at the academy was
because you were screwing the teacher.  Every time you get a
promotion, everyone will think it's because I made it
happen.  Our careers will fall to pieces, Kiyonne.  And I
can't do that to you."

	"I don't CARE what people think!  Forget them.  I just
want you!" Kiyonne pleaded.

	"Okay... another reason.  I am FAR too old for you
Kiyonne." Said her teacher in a desperate attempt to end
this, here and now.

	"Do you think I care about that?"  Kiyonne told him,
still holding the professor on top of her.  

	The professor sighed.  "You're not gonna make this easy
on me, are you Kiyonne?  Listen to me, I am over 40,000
years old, a father, and a widower.  I have had this job
since the early days of the galaxy police.  If I choose to
pursue this little endeavor with you, I will most certainly
lose my job.  And without this job, I'll have no way of
supporting my daughter, who, I hope, will follow in my
footsteps.  I cannot do that to myself, to you, or to her. 
I'm sorry, Kiyonne.  I know how much this moment must have
meant to you."

	"Oh, GOD!"  muttered Kiyonne in horror as the
realization of what she was doing pounded into her like a
freight train.  Slowly, she released her professor, who had
a look of confusion, shock, and sadness in his face. 
Kiyonne sat up on his plush, fluffy bed and began to cry. 
She buried her face into her hands and sobbed long, uneven
sobs.  All of a sudden, she felt a comforting hand fall upon
her trembling shoulder.  She looked up with tear soaked eyes
and saw the face of the man she loved so much, she let it
blind her of the reality of the situation.  She managed to
crack a very small, weak smile.

	"Don't cry, Kiyonne.  If we'd have met some other way,
like on the street or something, I would not even consider
having this conversation.  You are, without a doubt, the
most beautiful cadet I've ever taught."

	"R...really...?"  Kiyonne choked out through her
constant blubbering.  

	"Yes, really.  But, unfortunately, fate decided to play
us an unfair hand.  But, I want you to know this... I will
always be there for you, Kiyonne.  Anytime you need
anything, or to talk, or whatever, I'm only a call away. 
And you can always believe that."

	"Thank you... Professor L' nean." Kiyonne said, with
only a trace of regret.

	"You don't need to call me that, Kiyonne.  I'm no
longer your teacher.  Call me Mikhal..."


	And at that, Kiyonne woke up in a start.  She was
breathing hard and clutching the sheets.  She finally let go
of the slightly ripped sheets and made her way to the edge
of her bed.  Then, as she did before, she put her face in
her hands and began to cry.  

************************************************************

	At the same time as Kiyonne, Ryoko too, was dreaming. 
But it wasn't a sex dream involving Tenchi, or a major,
whacked up nightmare, but just a memory.  Her eyes fluttered
under their lids as her memory began...

	Instantly, she found herself back in Kagato's lab. 
Around her was the clear energy cell that he kept her in. 
She looked at herself and saw that she looked really young
again, maybe the equivalent of a 13 year old, on Earth.  She
was wearing that damn one-piece that Kagato liked to dress
her up in.  But, then she noticed that he wasn't there.  She
then remembered that he had gone off to some planet to get
some rare something or other.  He decided not to send her
out yet because he had not yet molded her to the perfect
killing machine yet.  Yet...

	She sat there in her corner, all scrunched up and
afraid to move, when, right before her eyes, a figure popped
up through the floor, right outside her cell.  He was young,
maybe her age, as he floated toward the invisible energy
barrier.  She held herself tight, preparing for the large
shock the poor boy was to receive, but it never came.  He
simply passed through it like it never existed.  He floated
up to the perplexed Ryoko.

	"Who are yo..." Ryoko began, but was unable to finish
when he put his finger up to her dry, parched, and cracked
lips.  The boy then waved his hand in the air and pulled a
bottle of water out of nowhere.  Ryoko licked her lips with
a dry tongue.  The boy then tossed it to her gently.  She
caught it and nearly ripped the entire bottle in half to get
it open.  Finally, she did and quenched her monstrous
thirst.  She let loose a loud "Ahh" as she looked into the
boys eyes in gratitude.  He simply nodded as he reached for
her hand.  Just as he grabbed her small, frail hand, a loud
alarm went off.  The boy just sighed and motioned for Ryoko
to stay there.  He then walked out of the cell and out into
the interconnecting hallway.  Suddenly, the doorway blew
open as an older boy ran into the cell hallway, through the
smoke.  

	"Ah hell, I think I messed up.  Come on Matsui, let's
split!"  shouted the boy.  

	"Ahh..." muttered the nice boy, Matsui.  

	"Come on, damn it!  We DON'T have the time to fuck
around!"  yelled the other boy.

	"But, Togusa!" yelled Matsui.  

	"NOW!!" shouted Togusa as loud as he could.  Suddenly,
a massive robot slammed through the broken door.  It was
fearsome and evil in its intent.  Togusa screamed in fear as
a massive sword slammed into the ground in front of him. 
The robot and Togusa began to fight in a life or death
struggle, and Togusa, due to lack of experience, was losing. 
Soon, the robot had Togusa pinned against the wall.  

	"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"  screamed Matsui as he
leaped in front of the robot, piecing the robot's thorax
with his laser Kitana and slicing him up to his head,
ripping the robot in half.  Losing all of its power, the
robot's arms fell to the ground at a lightening fast pace. 
Before he could move, Ryoko saw the bladed arm fall at an
angle and come down upon her new friend, slicing him through
the neck.  His blood squirted everywhere as Togusa screamed
in protest.  

	"MATSUI!!!  NO!"  Togusa shouted in the most hurt and
damaged voice he had.  The robot finally fell, mere seconds
after Togusa's younger brother did.  He quickly scooped up
his brother's limp body and faded away.  

	"NO! COME BACK!  TAKE ME WITH YOU!"  shouted Ryoko
tears forming at the corner of her eyes.  She slowly fell to
her knees as she began to cry.

	But, in a small hut in a heavily forested area of the
planet of Rigal, the real Ryoko stirred awake and slowly sat
up, rubbing her eyes.  She yawned, and got out of bed.  Her
head pounded and the sunlight poking through the shut window
hurt her eyes immensely.  

	"Oh, god.  Not another day."  She muttered as she
walked into the accursed sunlight.  

************************************************************

	Ryoko stumbled along the small pathway made for the
temporary town.  She made her way down to a clearing, where
she heard the sound of combat.  She walked up to the
clearing and saw Gillian and Togusa sparing.  As they
fought, they cut down small trees and scorched the ground. 
Matsui sat a few meters off, watching the mock fight.  Ryoko
looked at him and remembered her dream.  She smiled as she
remembered his kindness, and nearly cried when she
remembered what had happened to him.  'How is he still
alive?' she wondered, but shrugged it off when she decided
it wasn't important.  Finally, a few minutes later, Matsui
blew on a small whistle, a misshapen version of Earth's
typical whistle.  It made a loud, high pitched screech that
echoed through the forest.  A few birds flew off into the
distance.  A few seconds later, there was a rustling in the
trees.  Ryoko heard this, and, she also felt the small
tremors in the ground, which were growing louder and louder
as the seconds rolled by.  

	"Oh no..." mumbled Ryoko as suddenly trees started
flying in the air, out in the distance.  Using their
superior senses, Ryoko and Gillian focused in the forest. 
They saw the most evil looking alien creatures that the two
of them have ever seen in all of their travels.  Massive,
brutal looking creatures that looked like a cross between a
bear and a scorpion began to pour out of the trees.  They
were over ten feet tall, walked on two legs, had a long,
hairy scorpion tail with a foot long spike on the end and
their faces looked like a cross between Predator(tm) and a
rat.  Everyone's jaws dropped when these creatures began
their ascent on the small town.  

	"RUN!" shouted Ryoko as hundreds of the creatures began
to enter the small clearing.

	"NO!  YOU RUN, WE'LL HOLD'EM OFF!" Shouted Togusa,
always the noble one.

	"Not this time buddy, you left me once, you aren't
doing it again!" commented Ryoko as more creatures came in. 
One of the creatures attacked Togusa, but he summoned his
laser scimitar just in time to kill the vile creature.  And,
just as one died, three ran in to take it's place.

	"Well, someone has to go before these things reach the
town!  Everyone'll be slaughtered!" Ryoko added.

	"Fine.  Stop your bitchin'!  I'll go!" said Gillian as
she faded into the air after killing another one of the
creatures.

	More and more creatures flooded out of the forest,
nearly overwhelming the small group.

	"Shit!  This is gonna be harder than I thought!"
smirked Togusa as he decapitated two monsters...

************************************************************

	Washu exited her hut and stretched in the sunlight. 
'What a warm day.  I like it here.  I guess I'm gonna have
to come back one day.' She thought to herself.  But her
internal conversation was interrupted by the sound of
someone shouting bloody murder.  Curious, as always, Washu
ran up to the source of all the racket.

	"Everybody run!  Any minute now a shitload of big, big,
BIG creatures are gonna wash over this little town like some
freaking PLAGUE!" shouted that girl from the bar.  'Gillian,
that's right...' thought Washu.  Hearing this, she ran up to
her.

	"Hey, what did you say?"  asked Washu in her ever
curious manner.

	"I SAID that a hoard of massive hairy beasts are going
to attack this small town and kill us ALL in a matter of
minutes!  Everyone MUST EVACUATE!"  she hollered at the
diminutive red head.  

	"Maybe we can help!"  returned Washu once her hearing
returned.  Washu then held out her hands in a keyboard
typing position and her transparent laptop appeared out of
thin air.  She typed on a few keys and out of the thin air
popped Kiyonne, Mihoshi, Ayeka, Funhao, and Misaki.  They
hit the ground with a thump and quickly got back up, fully
angered at this sudden intrusion.  

	"Washu!  What is the meaning of this!?" yelled Ayeka.

	"We need your help, or, guess what...?" asked Washu.

	"What?" asked the newly summoned group.

	"OR WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!"  she shouted into a megaphone
that she pulled out of nowhere. 

	"Now that we all know the direness of the situation,
why don't you lead the way?" continued the small scientist
as she turned to Gillian.  

************************************************************

	A million things plowed through Matsui's head while he
was fighting these creatures.  All of them seemed to point
to one thing... 'I've got to protect her.'  And every time
he thought that, he fought just a little bit harder.  He
quickly glanced at his brother, checking on him.  He's doing
fine... barely breaking a sweat.  In the moment he let his
guard down, ten of the creatures came forward and attacked
with unmatched fury and speed.  Well, almost unmatched
speed.  Moving so fast that he seemed a blur, Matsui leaped
backward and pulled out a huge gun, bigger than the one that
he pulled on his brother, just last night.  He pressed the
trigger and fired.  The massive bullet flew in the center of
the clump of creatures and exploded, taking out eight of
them.  He began to aim again when the creatures suddenly
were upon him.  He managed to summon an energy bomb and
tossed it at one of them, blowing a hole in one of the two
creature's chest.  Blood flew everywhere, the sent summoning
even more of the creatures.  A whole gang of them nearly
toppled him, but before they could reach, Matsui felt
himself being lifted into the air.  He looked up to see
Ryoko, the girl he met so many years ago.  She smiled back
at him as she lifted him up and set him down in a safe spot. 
But even there the creatures came, trying to kill off the
intruders.  Before the hoard could reach, Matsui whipped his
arms out to the side, and two medium sized guns flew out of
his sleeves.  Quick, like lightening, he lifted the guns up
and fired, wasting two or three of the creatures.  He
noticed them fall two the ground, squirming in pain and
agony.  He smiled slightly.  Ryoko noticed this and felt a
slight chill crisscross her spine.  Somehow, this boy was
different now.  She just couldn't place it. Crazed by the
sent of blood, more and more creatures just piled on top of
the other ones.  Matsui and Ryoko were backed against the
wall of one of the buildings in the town, when, suddenly, a
big black hole opened up under the charging group of
creatures.  They looked up and saw Gillian flying, carrying
just about everyone.  She began to look fatigued.  Washu
twisted out of her grasp and fell to the ground.  She stood
up tall and smiled.

	"Ahh, more specimens.  Come on!  We don't have all day. 
Most of the town has been deserted already.  Let's pack our
stuff and leave!" she said as she approached the two. 
Matsui looked at Ryoko and shrugged.  Ryoko did the exact
same thing.  Ryoko watched as Gillian dropped off her
passengers at different parts of the battle.  The creatures
seemed to flow out of the forest like a demonic flood.  As
more died, more came to take their place.  Kiyonne stuck by
Gillian, watching her back.  Mihoshi stuck by Kiyonne, like
always, cowering behind her more competent partner.  Washu
stayed out of the battle for the most part.  She analyzed
the creatures and conducted research.  She tried to find a
flaw, and was so far unsuccessful.  Misaki and Funhao stood
by each other.  They used their Juraian powers to fight the
evil creatures and defend those they had grown to love. 
Ryoko then looked at Matsui.  His eyes lighted up as he ran
toward the battle field.

	"Matsui!  Wait!  Don't go in there!"  Ryoko yelled,
like a concerned parent.

	But Matsui ran into the battle, dodging a fight at
every turn.  He eventually reached a very tall tree.  He
teleported all the way up to the top.  Ryoko couldn't even
guess at what he was doing.  He sat on the tallest branch,
lotus style.  His green eyes widened as he summoned two
mini-laptops, like Washu's, only under each hand.  He tapped
at the keys a while and then covered his ears.  'What the
hell is he... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!" 
screamed Ryoko as a loud high pitched whistle began to play. 
It was the same tone as the alien whistle he had used
earlier, only amplified much, much more.  The creatures all
stopped fighting as they looked up at the tree.  They all
began to herd around the tree, snarling, and a few began to
scale it.  Ryoko, Mihoshi, Gillian, Togusa, and Washu all
covered their ears and screamed in pain as Ayeka, Funhao,
Misaki and Kiyonne just looked at them weird.  Matsui, his
ears still covered, began to type on his little laptops
again.  In the sky, Kiyonne saw a black spot form.  It
rocketed out of orbit and flew right above Matsui.  It was
Leo-oki.  It growled in discontentment at the high pitched
noise.  Matsui typed a command and closed his eyes as
everyone was teleported off the planet and into Leo-oki. 
Leo-oki then roared a fearsome roar and commenced firing on
the surface of the planet, killing off millions of the
creatures.  They leapt at him, but Leo-oki was too far up. 
Finally, shielded from the noise, Togusa shook his head
violently and said to Leo-oki :

	"Okay, okay.  You've had your fun.  Join the rest of
the fleet, and make it quick."

	Leo-oki roared loudly as the sky around them shifted to
blackness as they reached outer space.  Ayeka looked over at
Ryoko.

	"You just HAD to pick Rigal, didn't you?!"  she yelled.

	"Well, I'm sorry!  I just heard that no one had
colonized it yet!  I didn't know that it was because whoever
tried was slaughtered by... whatever those things are!"  she
returned.

	"I swear, your just incorrigible!"  Ayeka groaned as
she turned her back and walked away.  Washu walked over to
Matsui.

	"So, how did you get those?" she asked.

	Matsui pointed at himself and mouthed "me?"

	"Yeah, you.  You're the only one I'm talking to." Said
Washu with a little more sarcasm than normal.

	Matsui just shrugged and typed on the keypads : I'VE
ALWAYS HAD THEM.  I DON'T KNOW WHERE I GOT THEM.  The words
popped up on a little holographic synthesizer, in full 3d
and in bold.  Washu giggled to herself.  'I might just like
this kid...' she thought.

	"YOU JUST MIGHT." Typed Matsui.
