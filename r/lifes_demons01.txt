Life's Demons-Prologue


    People screaming, children crying, lives leaving their bodies.  The
Demoness causes this as her red eyes burn into her victims.
Her eyes shift as one man tries to escape. She jumps to him and grabs him,
pinning him face down.

    "Please let me go! You've already taken my family, most of my life. You
have nothing to lose if you don't kill me!"

    "Silence! If I have already taken most of you life, then you have
NOTHING to live for. My Master only lets me eat flesh and drink blood. Yours
will do fine."

    As she leaned down, the man swore he saw traces of tears. She bit, it
hurt, but at least he was going to be with family. There still was one
question left. Why do this if you were going to cry about it?

    "...ah..." He could hardly breathe. "May I have...one...last
uh...request?"

    She looked at him. "What is it? Why do you need to know anything, you
are just to die!?"

    He looked up. "Why do this. You have nothing to gain. Yet, you
are...crying?"

    She gave him a sad look. The redness of her eyes turned to gold, and her
face became gentle. She traced her finger in the dirt, the only way that her
master would not find out.

    The man slowly looked at the three words, not very neatly, written in
the dirt. "I'm not free." Then she continued, "So sorry." He looked back up
to see the redness back. "Goodbye, little man." Then she swooped down,
draining the last bit of blood in his body, killing him.
She let out a roar and disappeared.

    Tenchi awoke in ice, cold sweat. Sitting up quickly, he turned his light
on. "What was that all about?" He whispered. "wasn't that Ryoko? I'll wait
'till morning. I'll ask her or Washu about it." He yawned and quickly
falling asleep.
