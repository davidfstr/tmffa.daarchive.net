Authurs Notes: Hello. For all of those who haven't read my space adventures,
I am Fame. I will finish the Space Adventures shortly. But right now I am
starting my new series: Tenchi Muyo! Tenchi Loves Me!
Yuugi is not the enemy in this series. Just because there is a lot of her in
my stories doesn't mean anything. She is just another character.

Disclaimer: I do not own, or claim any of the Tenchi Muyo! Characters. I am
just a 11 year old kid, having fun writing story's about my favorite
cartoon. So don't sue me!

Now to the show, Episode 2:Yuugi's Spirit

______Breakfast

Mihoshi:Hey Sasami, want to play video games after breakfast?

Sasami: No, but thanks.

Ayeaka:A walk in the garden?

Sasami:No.

Tenchi:Are you all right Sasami?

Sasami:Can you pass the syrup? Im fine, Tenchi. Why do you ask?

Ryoko:Yeah squirt. You haven't been playing much.

Ryo-oki:*Jumps on the table and onto Sasami's head*

Sasami:Me and Ryo-oki are going to visit Yuugi's Stasis. (The others don't
know about her spirit/astro form whatever you want to call it)

Everyone looked at Sasami.

Ayeaka:Well OK Sasami. There's no harm in that.

Ryoko:But Yuugi at...

Tenchi:Ryoko, she's changed. And plus, Yuugi is in her Stasis.

Sasami:*Looks away* So I'm off!

_________Stasis, but nooooo, the Spirit

Yuugi:Sasami... I'm over here!

Sasami:*Turns around to see Yuugi's Spirit and then runs to tag her but
trips on a stump* Auhhh!

Yuugi:*Face changes into shock* Sasami! *Runs up and trips too*

The two girls began to laugh.

Yuugi:Sasami, your my best friend.

Sasami:I could have told you that. *The two girls giggle* Hey Yuugi...

Yuugi:Hmm?

Sasami:Did you mean to hurt Ayeaka?

Yuugi:*Looks down* No Sasami. I didn't want to. I've changed.

Sasami:*Smiles slightly and then giggle and tags Yuugi and runs* Your it!

Yuugi:Begin's running around.

Tenchi:Sasami? Sasami where are you?

Sasami:Oh no. I have to go.

Ayeaka: Sasami....

Ryoko:SASAMI! WHERE ARE YOU?!

Tenchi:*Walks up to see Sasami running after... noting* Sasami?

Sasami:Hi Tenchi!

___________Mihoshi

Mihoshi:*Sits down* <I wish Kiyone would call. I miss her so much.>

Ring Ring!

Mihoshi:*Awnsers it* Hello? Im Mihoshi.

Kiyone:Mihoshi?

Mihoshi:*Stands up on the couch* Kiyone?! Is that you!

Kiyone:Yeah! How are you doing?

Mihoshi:Oh! I'm doing great! And y... Kiyone?

Kiyone:*Begins crying* It's horrible here! I'm so bored! And they won't let
me do anything!

Galaxy Morge man:Kiyone! We need you to pull the regerstrations out!

Kiyone:FINE! Well Mihoshi. I have to go.

Mihoshi:Ok bye Kiyone.

Kiyone:Love you, bye bye.

Mihoshi:*Hangs up almost crying. And then does cry* I want Kiyone!!!

__________Who was Sasami playing with?

Washu:I've figured it out!

Tenchi:What is it? Who was Sasami playing with?

Washu:Remeber when you were a child? And only you could see Ryoko's
unphysical bilogical, interactive, nonnegative, byosphere, astro form?

Tenchi:....

Washu:Her spirit Tenchi! Her spirit! Sasami is the only one who can see...
Yuugi's.

Ryoko:So why can Sasami only see Yuugi?

Ayeaka:Is Yuugi bad again!?

Washu: No. Ayeaka she is not bad. Ryoko,  Sasami can see Yuugi because she
has a craving for an old friend.

Ryo-oki:Miya?

Washu:She still likes you too.

Tenchi: Is there anything wrong with her?

Washu:NO!

_______Tenchi taking a walk... In the past

Tenchi:So many things are going on. At times like this I wish I did choose
the girl I love when I had the er- chance. She loved me. And still does.
She'd do anything for me. I love her. Who would be a good wife though?
Let's start with, Kiyone- Well, I can't take Kiyone because her and Mihoshi
are going out. And even if not, she is to stiff. That puts out Kiyone... and
Mihoshi.
Washu- Washu is more like a mother. Maybe my science teacher. Mentor? I
don't know. But anyways, that puts Washu out.
Sasami-No. Simply because she is to young. And her father would kill me!
Ayeaka-Ayeaka would probally be one of my top choice. She is smart, sweet,
cunning, all around competitive, and she is also pretty cute too. That leave
Ryoko.
Ryoko- Well we come to Ryoko. She is fun, funny, outgoing, a little wierd, a
pig (At times) She loves me and has for the longest time. And hey, Ryoko is
gorgous!

Ryoko:Tenchi? Are you ok?

Tenchi:*Turns to see Ryoko, wearing her hair up, white earings, a white
shiny dress, and the lipstick.
