"I should took those damn headache pills from Washu before I left!" Ryoko 
said browsing through the medicine cabinet. 
"I thought Sasami got some for Tenchi, but they're not here!" ~hmm, now 
where could they be? I know they must be in Tenchi's room! Who would 
have guessed that Tenchi loved Ayeka, and I can't change it no matter how 
hard I try! But I won't be like Ayeka, just because this is hurting me doesn't 
mean it has to be this way for them too. Once I heal, I'll just leave and 
become a space pirate again~ Ryoko thought phasing into Tenchi's room.

************************************
 Ryoko noticed a bottle in the drawer and picked it up. 
"Huh," Tenchi woke up only to find Ryoko roaming through his things. 
Ryoko froze. 
"Ryoko what are you looking for?" Tenchi said as he sat up and turned on 
the lamp by his bed. Tenchi rubbed his eyes. Ryoko just stood there trying 
not to look at Tenchi. A tear rolled down her cheek when she heard Tenchi's 
voice. She quickly wiped it away and turned around dropping the bottle on 
the floor. It rolled over to Tenchi.
"I was just looking for some aspirin," Ryoko responded in a low voice. 
"Well, here," Tenchi said grabbing the pills off the floor and holding them 
out in his hand so that she could reach them. Tenchi gave Ryoko a warm 
smile hoping that it would cheer her up, but it didn't work. Ryoko just 
grabbed the pills thanked him and left without even looking up. Tenchi sat 
there looking at the spot where Ryoko left. "Ryoko," he said in a low voice. 
Tenchi heard something outside his door so he got up to take a look. The 
door opened and Tenchi poked his head out and saw Ayeka yelling at 
Ryoko. 
"Ryoko! What were you doing in Lord Tenchi's room? You really are 
impossible Ryoko! You would still go into Lord Tenchi's room and harass 
him even when you're injured. I can't even believe that he was actually 
worried about you! You really should be ashamed of yourself Ryoko! Now I 
want you to go into Lord Tenchi's room and apologize!" Ayeka shouted 
pointing to Tenchi's door. Ryoko fired at Ayeka missing on purpose and 
getting ready to fire again. 
"Listen little miss princess, I don't know who you think you are! But nobody 
talks to me that way, do you hear me! And if you'd like to know what I was 
doing I went in his room to get some aspirin!" Ryoko yelled looking up at 
Ayeka, tears flowing down her cheeks. Ryoko slowly held up the small 
bottle of aspirin and smiled. Ayeka was shocked at Ryoko's reaction. She 
could feel Ryoko's pain and began to cry also.
"Ryoko, I didn't know, but why Ryoko? Why didn't you just take the pills 
Washu was going to give you?"
"Because if I did one of you would go tell Tenchi that I finally woke up and 
that I'm doing fine, then I'd have to look at his face again. I went to go look 
elsewhere and tried to find them. After that I went to Tenchi's room trying 
not to wake him up so I would not have to look at him or hear his voice till I 
left," Tenchi was hurt and confused, but decided it was best if he didn't say 
anything.
"But why Ryoko? I don't understand. Why would you not want to see Lord 
Tenchi? I thought that you," Ayeka said just as Ryoko cut her off.
"Because, because he loves you that's why!" Ryoko yelled. Ayeka's eyes 
went wide. 
"What did you say Ryoko," 
"I hope you two will be happy together,"
"Ryoko how do you know this?"
"Because he said so his self,"
"What!" Tenchi said cutting Ryoko off and realizing that everyone was now 
looking at him. Ryoko gasped then turned around and looked at Tenchi.
"Tenchi," Ryoko whispered backing up. 
"What's goin' on?" Mayuka said crawling up the stairs. Ryoko turned 
around. 
"Why are you crwing mommy?" Ryoko sniffled and smiled trying to hold 
back her tears. Just then, there was an explosion.
"What was that?" Keone said turning around.
"I don't know, but we better go check it out," Ayeka responded looking at 
Keone. 
"Hey what are you doing just standing there? Don't tell me you didn't just 
hear that explosion! Come on lets go check it out!" Washu said running 
down the stairs. Everyone else just followed. ~Ryoko is like this because of 
me! I hate myself for it after this I'll tell Ryoko that I'm sorry and 
everything will be back to normal~ Tenchi thought smiling to himself as he 
ran. When the others got outside they found Washu typing away on her holo 
computer. 
"What was that Washu?" Ayeka asked looking at the computer.
"I don't know yet you and the others go get some rest and I'll have it all 
figured out by morning,"
"What about you Washu?"
"Oh I'll be alright. You just worry about getting some sleep and I'll have 
this all figured out by tomorrow. Thanks for asking though,"
"All right goodnight Washu," Ayeka walked back to the others.
"So what did Washu say caused the explosion Ayeka?" Mihoshi said 
holding out her hands.
"She said just to get some sleep and she'll have it figured out by morning,"
"Good I thought it was something serious," Tenchi said relieved.

********************************************

"Are you sure this is the right way Washu?" Ryoko wined as she followed 
the others.
"Of course I do!" Washu yelled at Ryoko.
"Yes, I do have the feeling we have been here before," Ayeka said agreeing 
with Ryoko. Mihoshi looked around the hallway then pulled a sucker out of 
her pocket. Keone looked over in Mihoshi's direction.
"Mihoshi, this is no time to be eating candy" Keone yelled.
"Sorry," Mihoshi responded.
  It was a very bright white hallway with luiminated ceiling lights. The white 
marble floor looked like it had been polished, but at the same time somewhat 
unreal. In a sudden flash of bright light Ayeka found her self-lying on the 
bare floor sweating. She got off of the floor and noticed it was still 
nighttime. So, she decided to go downstairs and get some tea, then after 
maybe go see what Ryoko is up to.

**************************************

	There is laughter in the background with people cheering. 
"Mommy, mommy," wined a young girl with long purple hair, purple eyes, 
and wearing Juraian clothing, "can we open our gifts now?"
"Oh alright," responded a woman also with long purple hair, "but go ask 
your father first."
"Yeah! Daddy, daddy, mommy says we can open our gifts now!" the young 
girl runs up to a man with spiky brown hair, he picks her up. 
"Oh she did huh?" he says tickling her and putting her back down. She runs 
over to decorate the Christmas tree along with three other children. The 
purple haired woman chuckles and a tall woman with cyan colored hair and 
golden eyes, walks up in front of her.
"Hey princess, why aren't you helping us decorate the tree?" the tall woman 
with cyan hair asks.  
"Hmm, because they don't need our help. Look how happy they are playing 
together by themselves. They're getting along quite nicely. And for once I'm 
surprised you're not drunk why the sudden change?"
" I been stopped drinking! And plus they were having more fun when I was 
over there!" the lady with the cyan colored hair yelled. The woman with 
purple hair woman laughs.
"You know I'm just kidding, why don't you try getting into the Christmas 
spirit?" she says giving her a warm smile.
"You're right," the woman smiled, " I just can't help the feeling something 
will go wrong," said the woman with the cyan colored hair responded.
"Like what?" she responds sounding concerned; she stops smiling, "you're 
not still worried abut that crash and all those dreams we were having five 
years ago are you? Seriously I would never expect that from you. You can 
be a real worry wort sometimes. Did you know that? I mean it s been fine 
years now, if something were to happen don't you think it would have 
happened by now?" the woman with purple hair responds. A woman with 
curly blond hair and blue eyes walks up to the two ladies and hands them 
each a box one wrapped with blue and gold wrapping paper and the other 
purple and silver. They both thank her and ask him if they could help with 
anything. 
An old man runs in carrying some bottles in his hand, "hey why are you all 
just standing around? Get in the Christmas spirit, have some sake! It'll be all 
right its only one night and plus its Christmas, you're supposed to have fun!" 
the old man shouts, obviously drunk.
"I guess you two are right, I'm probably just overacting. C'mon princess I 
bet I can still drink faster than you!" the woman with cyan hair calls out as 
she grabs one of the bottles from the old man and ran to the couch.
"What! You never beat me!" the purple haired woman yelled back, 
"seriously ever sense you retired from being a space pirate you started losing 
your memory! I've always been better than you!" the purple haired woman 
calls out as she grabs two bottles from the old man and makes her way to the 
couch.
"Ahh, well everything seems to be back to normal," the young man with 
brown hair says smiling to himself as the two women fight over the last 
bottle of sake.
