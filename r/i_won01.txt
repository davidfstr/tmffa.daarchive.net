"I won"
A story about Ryoko

I guess I finally won.
It was easyer than I thought possible.
All I had to do was push.
She was already off balance, on that top step.
We were fiting as again, at the shrine, when she stumbled backward on that long 
stairway.
I could've grabbed her, stopped her fall, but instead I pushed.
I watched her rolling down those steps, I could have teleported down and stopped 
her at any point, now I wish I had.
I could have caught her when she reached the bottom, but I didn't.
All I did was laugh.

I'm going to see her today, as I have every day since she fell.
Washu says it's good for her to hear someone talking to her, says she'll 
improve.
Sometimes I wonder, as I watch her laying there, could I have... 
should I have... would I have stopped her decent?
I hope the situation never repeats itself  so I can find out.

Before this happened to her I'd never even heard of a coma.
That lifeless sleep that can last days.
She doesn't even toss and turn.
I wonder if she dreams.
I know she'll never forgive me, but I'll try to make it up to her.

Every day I try to help her wake up by talking to her.
I hold her hand, watch her life monitors...
Every day I put some of my power into her to try to wake her up.
I try to stimulate her mind with psycic signals from mine.
But it doesn't work.
So every day I hold her hand, watch her life monitors, and cry.
