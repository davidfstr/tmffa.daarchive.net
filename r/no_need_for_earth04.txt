No Need for Earth 4

Earth. A small blue planet at the edge of a backwater galaxy. What power
it holds beneath its heavenly sky.

"I have you now my chickey." The captain of space vessel utters as the
backwater planet dawns over its bastard moon. A lovely site for those
who care.

Red lights blaze across the control panel. "Ah crap." He mumbles.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sun bares to a new day. Nobuyuki is first of the Masaki clan to
wake, He opens his wary eyes to a dark room, light has yet to find their
way. He hears a brewing argument down stairs.

Baci: How could you do that?
Kaemon: Easy. First you take th-
Baci: No, no, how could you change your body like that. You don't even
look the same.
Kaemon: Yes I do I'm just a few inches shorter. I was just tired of
looking down at everyone.
Baci: It looks bad.
Kaemon: Does not.
Baci: Does too.
Kaemon: Not.
Baci: Look at him Makoto.
Makoto: I'm not here.
Baci: Oh yeah?
Makoto: Ow! Stop!
Hastings: Nock it off you two. Kaemon is entitled to do what he wants
with his body.
Kaemon: thank you. And Baci, when you get old and cracked, you'll want
youthful looks back.
Baci: Shut your trap.

Light has filled the room, Nobuykui turns his interest to the lump in
his bed.

He thinks to himself. "Dearest Achika. This is far from my wildest
dreams or hardest wishes. to stroke your silk spun hair, to touch your
petal soft lips, to feel your milky smooth skin, to hear your sighs of
pleasure when I ***********************
*************************************************************
*******************(Nobuyuki turns hentai so I cut this part)
************
*************************************************************
************************************************* you are my goddess
Achika."

"Nobuyuki?" Achika gragily says his name.

"Yes?" He whispers softly in her ear.

"Can you get off from work today?"

"Yes."

"Good, because I order you not to leave this bed. Now do me again!" she
throws her body on top of his.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sasami descents the stairs, a bit shaken from her last nightmare.
Stopping at the last step, she hears a conversation in the living room.

"What are our land lords going to say?" Baci scolds Kaemon.

"Nothing." He answers very assure of himself.

"And what if they do say something!?" Baci's though emotional barer
begins to brake down. "I don't want to get thrown out again."

Hastings tries to reassure her. "They seem like good people, they'll
understand where we're coming from."

Sasami chooses to enter the room. "Good morning everyone."

"Good morning Miss Sasami." They reply in unison.

A sweat drop appears on her head. "You don't have to call me Miss,
Sasami is fine."

"But we want to call you Miss." Again in unison.

Her drop gets bigger. "Please just call me Sasami."

"Ok." In unison.

"Breakfast will be ready soon."

"Thank you Sasami." Once again in unison. Another sweat drop appears as
she leaves.

Kaemon leans over to Baci. "See, she didn't notice." Baci pushes him
though his subspace door, which resembles the living room wall.

Last night when sleeping arrangements where being made for the guests,
Aeka and Ryoko had a fight. Their victim this time: a living room wall.
Kaemon offered to make his room in the hole using a subspace dimension.
Washu objected with "can't have two sub, lab, space" something like
that. In the end, Kaemon wound up with a wear house size room in the
wall.

Kaemon sticks his head out. "Sounds like some ones jealous."

A large explosion rocks the house, throwing the group off their feet and
string the rest of the family awake. (Except for Narah who can sleep
through anything) Ryoko and Aeka leap down the stairs. "What was that!?"
they yell.

"RYOKO! AEKA!" Tenchi appears at the top of the stairs. His temper boils
with nostrils flared.

Both women drop to their knees pleading. "We didn't do it Lord Tenchi,
honest!"

"Well it didn't happen by its self!" He blares at them.

Kiyone appears behind Tenchi. "Is everyone all right?"

Mihoshi pushes her way passed them, stopping half way down the stairs. "
Calm down calm down" she flashes them her badge. "Nobody need worry.
Commander of the SFIU here, and I'll get to the bottom of this case if
it's the last thing I do."

Everyone sweat drops. A second explosion knocks Mihoshi into the
pleading women.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(moments before the first blast)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An explosion rocks the house, jolting Achika into a sitting position.
"What was that?!" she asks Nobuyuki.

"Just Aeka and Ryoko fighting over Tenchi. Now where were we." He lays
her back down.

The second explosion throws the lovers out of bed. Achika scrambles to
her feet putting some clothes on.

Nobuyuki sits up and asks. "Where are you going? Oh, I know, bringing up
breakfast right?" Achika runs out the door. "Hurry back!" he hollers.

Achika slides to a stop at the top steps. Seeing the Kaemon group
helping up Tenchi Co. She worries and asks. "Is anybody hurt?"

Aeka: No.
Baci: No.
Hastings: No.
Ryoko: No.
Makoto: No.
Mihoshi: No.
Kaemon: No.
Sasami: No.
Makoto: yes, uh, no, I mean No.
Tenchi: No.

"Then who did this?" she asks.

Aeka and Ryoko fall to their knees crying. "It wasn't us lady Achika,
honest!"

The door to Washu's lab bursts open in a cloud of movie smoke. The mad
scientist steps out in chains, heavy boots, biker leather, and dark
shades. She turns to the onlookers, extends her hand and says. "Come
with me if you want to live."

Again sweat drops all around. A portal opens and they deiced to chance
it. Winding up at the lake's edge. Washu points to up at an approaching
space craft.

"That looks like a GP short range patrol ship." Hastings point out.

". . . What's it doing this far out?" Kaemon muses.

". . . Why isn't it slowing?" Ryoko muses.

". . . Because it's out of fuel. Everyone back in the house!" Kiyone
yells.

They scream in their mad rush to safety. Kaemon stops. "Why don't we use
the portal?!"

"Everyone, back in the portal!" Kiyone commands them.

The ship fires two shots, wiping out the portal.

"Everyone, back into the house!" commands Kiyone.

Sasami stops. "It's aiming for the lake!"

"Oh no! Yagami!" The detectives cries.

Everyone motions for the ship not to enter the lake, instead it crashes
into the lake shore. The Masaki clan slowly move toward the smoking,
crippled space craft. A pink light jumps from the ship, landing a few
yards from the newly startled group. It disappears leaving behind a
tall, well built man with a bag in his left hand and a GP spacial issue
gun in the right.

He scans the Masaki clan, stopping on Kaemon. "Well, well, well. Though
you could give me the slip and jump town, huh?"

"Uh, no, we left you a note McCloud, we just were hoping you wouldn't
find it so soon." Makoto hesitates.

"Oh, ok. I broth your stuff." McCloud searches his pockets, pulling out
what resembles a GP cube with multi colored sides, and tosses it to
Kaemon.

Kaemon gives him a look of disbelief. "How did you get this?"

"Your place blew up."

The Kaemon group face fault. "HUH?"

"It started with all those compressed wet hay barrels you keep storing
there. Someone left the heater on, and you know the rest. Boom."

"Um, question." Hastings raises his hand. "We appreciate your unselfish
act of coming this far out just to return our cube, but what will you do
now that it's over?"

". . . what are you stupid!? I'm gonna shadow you five criminals until
one of us dies or you turn your selves' in!"

Kiyone jumps up. "I'm detective first class Kiyone Makibi and this is-"

Mihoshi steps up, flashes everyone her badge again. "Commander of the
SFIU, and I have volunteered to take on this case and I am determined to
get to the bottom of it if it's the last thing I do."

"Mihoshi . . ." McCloud scratches his head. "Oh yeah! Mihoshi! I read
your report, now I can't find the restrooms on D level."

Kiyone butts in. "Who are you, and what have these people done to have a
GP officer follow them, that is, if you are a GP officer?"

"You don't think I'm a GP agent? Then I'll tell you my story of-"

"Oh no!" Tenchi looks at his watch. "We're going to be late for work!"
Tenchi Co. leaves in a mad rush to the house.

Baci taps McCloud on the shoulder. "What do you think of Kaemon's body?"
Kaemon strikes a pose.

". . . new hair cut?"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The final school bell rings a last call for students to be released from
its prison walls back to their free lives as homosapiens. Three of these
have been labeled Kielli, Evroma, and Sasami. These are of the feminine
type and full of life. They appear to be in gaged in conversation using
their native tongue. Why don't we listen in?

"Ask him." Kielli pressers Sasami to ask out Yokiuu.

"No." Has been her answer for the past hour.

"Ask him."

"No."

"Ask him."

"No."

"Ask him!"

"No!"

"Ask him!"

"And what if I do ask him, where are we going to go?"

"Take him to the movies."  Evroma suggests.

"Oh great, sit in a large dark room full of people for two hours."
Sasami lays the sarcasms thick.

"Then take him to that one movie, it has a lot of day time scenes."
Evroma continues to cokes Sasami out of her shell.

"Which one?" Kielli asks.

"It's that movie with those two cute guys who want to destroy the world
and the house wife's got to stop them with the two grungy guys."

"Yeah, yeah! With that other guy."

"Yeah that's the one!"

"Hey! We're talking about me! Not some dumb movie!" Sasami pouts.

The two girls skip over and ask simultaneously. "Are you going to ask
him out?"

"No!" she turns away.

They hang their heads. "She's hopeless." Kielli sighs.

Evroma looks up. "There he is." She points off in the distends.

Sasami's heart skips beat after hearing those word. She looks to see
Yokiuu walking away, his movement effortlessly like a cat. She grins,
how much she want's to tell him that just to speak his name can send her
to the serenity of heaven, yet so afraid of his rejection that could
open the chaos of hell upon her heart.

"Poor guy, living so far away from town, doesn't know a lot of people
either." Kielli whispers.

"And he always walks home, alone, every day, alone." Evroma whispers.

Sasami whips around. "I can hear you." She hisses at the two grinning
girls.

Sasami sees her third friend Kimmy. She waves her book bag trying to
catch her attention. Suddenly she feels a great weight lift from her
arm. Looking up she watches her Health, Geometry, and Math books sail
through the air, landing a few yards from her, except for the Math book
which continued to fly some yards farther before hitting Yokiuu in the
head.

Evroma, Kielli, and Kimmy cry out. "Oh my God! You killed him!"

Sasami sprints over to him holding back a flood gate of tears. "I am so
sorry, are you hurt?"

"I'm fine." He rubs his head. "I think this is yours Sasami." Handing
back her book.

"Y-you know my name?"

He opens the book and shows her, her name. Sasami turns an embarrassed
shade of red as she takes back her book.

"Thank you for this . . .  strange meeting." Yokiuu picks up his book
bag. "See you in school tomorrow Sasami." He walks away.

Sasami's mind screams out for her to stop him. But how? What can she do?
He walks farther away. Her mind races to find something, anything that
will stop him from leaving her.

A strange intoxicating wave of peace numbs her body. In a daze her mouth
opens uncontrollably, and cannot hear the seven exotic words escape her.
"Do you want to see a movie?"

Yokiuu turns slowly with a puzzled look across his face. "You speak
English?"

Sasami, realizing what she has done, drops her book and covers her mouth
all the while turning a new shade of embarrassing red. She shakes her
head ‘yes'.

"Oh, that's cool. What movie do you want to see?"

Her eyes widen. "You want to see a movie with me?" she asks despite her
hand muffling her voice.

"Yeah."

"Really?"

"Why? Is there something wrong?"

"No, no, no. I, I, I . . .  I have to call home, and tell them, . . . my
family, I'm going to be late."

"Ok."

"I'll be back." She walks away screaming in her head ‘I did it! I did
it! I did it!' then faints.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Narah has finally risen to the world of the wake. Beautiful senses
tickle her nose, signaling her stomach to ask for food.

"Patience my pet, patience." She lovingly rubs her stomach.

Following the senses back to its source in the kitchen she dose not find
a young girl slaving over a hot stove, but an older woman cooking over a
simmering pot. Oh well, at least some sort of food is being made.

"Good morning Lady Achika. When is breakfast?" she cheerfully asks.

"Good after noon and hours ago." Achika smiles.

"Hours?" a tone of sadness seeps from Narah's voice.

"Yes. I'm sorry there are no leftovers, but lunch will be ready soon if
you'll wait."

"Ok." She mopes.

"Your friends are with Ryu-ki."

"Ryo-oh-ki." She corrects her.

"That's right, Ryo-oh-ki, they're outside if your looking for them."

"Thank you Lady Achika. Good bye."

"Good bye." Achika returns to the task at hand.

Sure enough, right out side the house was the Kaemon group with
Ryo-oh-ki hooked up to an decimeter.

Narah places her hands on her hips. "What are you four doing with her?"

"We are trying to decipher her language." Kaemon pets Ryo-oh-ki.

"What language? All she can say is ‘meow'."

"That's what we thought until we heard that there are people in America
who can carry on whole conversations using just the word ‘dude'."

"Meow!"

"That's right! Isn't she cute?" Kaemon hugs Ryo-oh-ki. Narah sadly
shakes her head.

"We meet again Narah." McCloud steps out onto the porch. Narah spins
around, her eyes grow to saucer size. She shrieks and stumbles backwards
off the porch.

"Meow?"

"No, not at all." Hastings sighs.

* * *
The family of Masaki (minus Sasami) prepares themselves for a tail of
lies, betrayal, and deception. But before they watch the movie they'll
listen to McCloud read off the Kaemon group's criminal record. The look
of the living room resembles that of a court room. Tenchi Co. seated on
the couch and floor. Across from them sits The Kaemon group behind a
long table with McCloud paces between the two sets.

"Get on with it!" everyone screams.

He clears his throat. "As you already know, I am Spacial Operative
Agent: McCloud Krin. I was assigned to infiltrate and obtain information
from these five on various criminal acts committed during their life
spans. I will start with, . . . Makoto." All eyes shift to the one named
‘Makoto'. The man looks over his shoulder.

"Grand theft of two Galaxy Police patrol ships." Mihoshi and Kiyone are
taken aback as Makoto takes a bow.

"Hastings. illegal net work computer hacking and head of a software
piracy ring."

Hastings reclines in his chair. "Good times, good times."

"Narah. Threw her shoe at a Jurin ambassador." Ryoko bursts out
laughing. Aeka jams a hand full of rice crackers in Ryoko's gaping maw.

"Baci."

Baci slams her hands on the table. "Why do you do this McCloud?! Why do
you tell them what we were?"

"Because it's what you are and what you will forever be, criminals."

"But we're not like that anymore." she pleas with tear lines down her
cheeks. "Why must you tell them this?! Every where we go! You tell them
and they throw us out! Why must you do this?!"

"You should have thought of that before you started protrusion."

Tenchi Co. gasps at the words that exited McCloud breath. Baci sees the
looks on their face. The terrible secret is finally exposed to them. She
had prayer last night that they would not find out about her past, but
it is already too late, now they know. She sobs loudly, not even
bothering to collapse in her chair. Narah takes Baci into her arms and
shoots McCloud a hateful glare.

McCloud folds his arms. "I'm sorry Baci, but they have a right to know."

Kaemon slams his fist against the table. "That is enough Krin! You know
very well of our criminal past! And you know as well as us that Baci was
put out on the streets at the age of four, she sold her body till she
was 14, then was sold into a sex ring until she could buy her way out at
17. So if you're going to tell them, tell them everything!"

"That's insignificant information. I have to explain your criminal back
ground, not your life's back ground." He waves him off.

Kaemon produces an energy ball, threading him with it. "You cold hearted
bastard. I should have killed you when I had the chance."

Mihoshi points her gun at Kaemon. "I won't do that if I were you,
killing a GP Agent is punishability by immediate death."

"See Kaemon. The law is on my side, you can't touch me. And there's
nothing you can-do about it." McCloud gleams a wicked smile.

Ryoko's energy blade comes an inch from his neck. "Oh but I can Mr. Krin
and there's nothing you can do about it."

Tenchi tries to shout over Baci's sobbing. "Stop! Everyone! This is
getting out of hand! No one is going to kill anybody, not today, not
ever, and especially not in this house! You understand!?"

"Yes Lord Tenchi." Is their response.

Washu claps her hands. "Very well done, we should start a dinner
cabaret. Now I draw your attention to the approaching Jurin ship."

"What? Here? Now?" Aeka trips on her way to the door with Kiyone,
Kaemon, Ryoko, Ryo-oh-ki, Makoto, Mihoshi, McCloud, and Hastings in tow.

"Why me?" Tenchi sighs before joining the precession.

Narah consoles the crying woman Baci with soothing words like the kind a
mother would tell her daughter. "It's all right Baci, everything will be
all right. I promise."

Achika slowly approaches the two and cannot help but feel sorry. They
are not what they were, they no longer have their heart for it, yet it
still hangs over them. She puts her hand on Baci's shoulder.

Baci pulls her face from Narah's shoulder. Her tear burnt eyes' look
squarely into Achika's. "You want us to leave, don't you?"

Achika shakes her head ‘no'. "I won't judge you for what happened in
your past, because you can't change that. You can only change your
hearts, and I can see you have succeeded in doing so. You have a home
here now."

So few people have shown such kindness toward her as Achika has. Tears
of joy rain from Baci as she hugs Achika tightly. Achika returns the hug
and can see Narah mouth the words ‘thank you Lady Achika' as her own joy
flowing down her cheeks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"That is not of the imperial Jurin fleet or any of the lower houses for
that matter. Come to think of it I've never seen a ship like that at
all. Have you?" Aeka asks her guardians.

"No, I have never seen a ship such as that one." Azaka answers.

"Neither have I. We're sorry we couldn't have been more help princess
Aeka." Kamadaki answers.

"Do you know what it is Ms. Washu?" Tenchi asks the frantically typing
scientist.

"It is an unregistered Jurin ship and it won't answer my calls. That is
all I know."

Mihoshi puts a finger to her chin. "Hmm, Jurin ships and unregistered
space crafts. This case is getting more twisted by the minute. You
should let me do all the thinking Kiyone, your brain might handle it."
Kiyone grinds her teeth.

Ryoko asks. "Hey! Why doesn't someone ask me?"

"Because your opinion is as appreciable as a pustule." Aeka spats.

"Like the one on your face?" Ryoko returns the viable attack.

Aeka covers her face. "You lie!" she shrieks.

"Hold still I'm gonna pop it." She pokes her in the nose.

Aeka holds her nose. "Ow! Brainless monster woman!"

"I'm sorry Aeka, I thought it was a gigantic pimple growing out of your
face."

Aeka pulls on Ryoko's bangs, which sparks the fight, that brings Tenchi
to stop the fight, that scarce the cat, that killed the rat, that ate
the malt, that lay in the house that Jack built.

The Jurin ship, no bigger than the Masaki home, eases its way closer to
earth. Its trim body barley touching the tree tops. It seems it has
chosen the large open carrot fields as a landing spot.

"I think you should bring Mouser down."  McCloud tells Kaemon.

"I was thinking that too." He sighs.

"Meow meow?" Ryo-oh-ki asks Makoto.

"Kill each other? No, McCloud and Kaemon have their tiffs but not so
much as to kill each other."

"Meow."

Kaemon types a couple of keys on his laptop, his cube floats out of a
small dimensional pocket. He punches some more keys. Colored lights
flash from the cube as it rotates with blinding speed. It freezes and
hops back in the pocket leaving a quickly materializing portable
antiaircraft gun behind.

"Hastings."

Hastings nods and holsters the gun. He picks his mark, then charges a
large golden energy ball at the gun's tip. With a loud bang, the energy
ball rockets toward the ship, hitting under neath the tail end with a
monstrous blast. Tree tops snap and black smoke pores from the rapidly
descending wounded Jurin ship, as it tries desperately tries to land in
the carrot fields.

"MEOW! MEOW MEOW MEOW!" Ryo-oh-ki panics.

Washu checks one of her many hovering screens. "By my calculation of the
ship's velocity, mass, gravitational pull of the earth, wind speed, and
the cost of carrots at the market. It will over shoot its desired
landing mark and land in the second floor bath room sink."

"Meow." Ryo-oh-ki sighs relief as everyone face faults.

The Masaki clan lets out all the fire power they can muster on the
approaching ship.

"Meow!?"

The ship slows dramatically over the carrot fields.

"Meow!!"

The ship nose is the first to plummet in the fields with dust and smoke
bellowing out into the evening air, blurring the vision of the Masaki
clan. When the dust and smoke faded, the Jurin ship stood in the fields
with its nose in the ground and tail in the air.

"MMMEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" is Ryo-oh-ki's last
word before fainting in Makoto's arms.

"Ryo-oh-ki?, Ryo-oh-ki?!, are you all right? Say something." Makoto
shakes the small cabitt.

A hatch door pops open on the downed ship, a minute later a woman falls
out startling the group.

The woman takes a look at the ship, turns to them and yells. "Look at
what you did to my ship you detested piece of your mothers' foul
smelling, puss spewing, diseased rectum!"

"Friend of your's?" Tenchi asks Kaemon.

"Sadly yes." He replies.

Makoto yells back at the woman. "Quit your sniveling you moss haired,
snot eating old hag."

The woman screams with rage. She pulls out a Tenchiken like handle and
activates its blue light blade, then rushes them at an alarming speed.

"Azaka, Kamadaki, stop her!" Aeka orders her guardians.

"Yes ma'am!" the two logs fly off chanting their battle cry. "Here we
go, here we go."

The woman slams face first into the guardians' shield only 10 feet from
the princess. She drops to her knees rubbing the sting from her face.

Aeka pushes pass Azaka and Kamadaki, picking up the woman's fallen
Tenchiken. "You have Jurin blood?" she asks with a hint of disbelief in
her voice.

"Yeah! And what's it to you?!" the woman hisses before seeing who it is.
" . . . Pr-Princess Aeka!" the woman bows deeply, covering her head.
"I'm sorry Princess Aeka. If only I had known it was you, I won't have
been so fresh. I'm sorry! Please don't hurt me princess!"

Aeka receives a sweat drop, then Ryoko butts in. "Aeka! I am ashamed of
you! Having this girl executed just for not recognizing you is beneath
you."

"Shut up you insinuating maggot! I am not going to execute her!"

"Yes ma'am!" the two logs chime, missing the point of the conversation.

"NO!" Aeka screams, covering the woman.

* * *
"My name is Elysim Clevra."

"We nick named her Mouser." Makoto cuts off the woman.

She ignores him. "I am a descendant from the house of Clevra on the
planet Juri."

"The house of Clevra is very loyal to the Imperial house of Juri." Aeka
states.

"That's correct princess. Thank you." Elysim bows her head. Ryoko groans
at the site.

"I've come on a small vendetta from the bank of Juri. 8 years ago the
bank was robbed of 308 billion dollars. As a bounty hunter they hired me
to retrieve the money and bring the pirates back to Juri for sentencing.
During my searches I crossed paths with Kaemon and his groupies and-"

"And I'll explain the rest." Hastings cuts off Elysim. "We were seen in
the bank three hours before it was robbed and we left Juri 8 hours after
the money was lifted. Elysim looked over our criminal records and found
we where the perfect suspects in this case, and to this day she still
thinks we stole the money, even though she has zero evidence. And if we
did steal that much money, do you think we would have payed for your
silence, then spent the rest?"  He asks her.

Kiyone puts the pieces together. "So that's why McCloud has been
shadowing you for so long."

"Exactly. You're a lot smarter than you look Ms. Kiyone."

"Kaemon. How long will it take for you to repair my ship." Elysim asks.

He takes a long look at her downed ship. "Your ship is totaled Elysim.
You're stuck here, with us, them, and a little cabbit."

"NOOOOOO! Not you! , Not them! , Not a . . . uh, . . . what IS a cabbit
any ways?"

"Oh please Lord Tenchi, may Elysim stay with us?, she has no where else
to go." Aeka stares Tenchi down with her sparkling eyes attack.

"Uh, I . . . can't see why not." Tenchi nervously rubs the back of his
neck.

"Oh Lord Tenchi you're so Nobel." She wraps her arms around him. Ryoko
goes to brake up the embrace.

Mihoshi shouts. "Ok everybody, I think I have this case solved."
Everyone stares at her confused. "Now to understand who did it, I'll
have to take you back to the year 1492."

* * *
"And that's how it happened. Case closed." She dusts her hands as
everyone collapses.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Achika pours some tea for Narah, then stops staring into space.

"Is something wrong Lady Achika?" Baci asks.

"No, I just had a strange feeling I forgot something."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nobuyuki pokes his head out of the bedroom. "Achika?"
