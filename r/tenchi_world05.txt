"Lets make a deal shall we"Jun Pao said, still holding Ping in the air "I'll
forget what you have done to me a few minutes ago if you join my side"Jun
Pao spoke in a deep voice,which seems very evil,he was bald man he was a7 ft
tall man that is always waring  white pants with a brown shoes,and had
tatoos of different dragons all over his body."So what do you think Ping the
space pirate?"With some breath still left in Ping he replied back
"I don't know."
"You don't know what!?"asked Jun Pao, his face draws closer to Pings.Then
Ping replied
"I don't know wether to tell you if you need breath mint or Toilet paper for
your mouth because it really really stin..........",Jun Pao not leting him
finish his comment,threw Ping across the room casuing him to hit wall and
slide down to the ground uncaunscience,And then Jun Pao walk towards
Ping,looked at him,and then kicked him while he was on the ground.Lord
Grendoble who was present at the time could only watch Jun Pao's cruel
action perform on Ping.
"Now where were we?"Said Jun Pao"Oh thats right prepare to die
Grendoble!"Then he walks towards Grendoble untill he heard a voice
"Wasup man turn around!"Ping said Then Jun Pao turned around to face Ping
but when he barely turned to see his face he found himself flying 2 feets
away from him, he got back up and yelled
"You fool nobody strikes Jun Pao and gets away with it!!!"Then Ping got
ready to fight.
"C'mon man I'm ready!"Ping said but then Jun Pao smiled and replied back
"I would but it apears that I'm out numbered"
"Huh?What do you mean?"Ping asked then he turns around to see an estimated
number of 50  armed officers having their blasters aim at him and Jun
Pao.But then suddeny a royalty dress women runs into the room and knelt down
besides Grendoble.
"Darling!Darling"The women said"Are you allright"trying to help up Grendoble
at that moment Jun Pao quickly rushes to her and grabbed her by the hair.
"So this is your wife huh?"said Jun Pao talking to Grendoble
"Let her go!"Yelled Grendoble but then Jun Pao smiled and said
"I would but she's my escape untill then we'll meet again Ping the space
pirate"then he teleports himself to his space ship along with the Noble
man's wife.
"Allright you how did you get out your cell?"said the cheif,walking towards
Ping
"Wait!?"said Grendoble"this man saved my life"then he turns and looked out
of the window.
"Sir we will do all we could to get your wife back"the cheif said
"I know.But please let Ping help I'm sure he'll prove usefull"
"Him!"the cheif said "but he stole the galaxies police prized possesion the
Hagasake"
"No I didn't Hagasake came to me and that disk you have is his memory
file"said Ping
"Hmmmmm.Allright We'll look into this can you fly a one man ship?asked the
cheif
"Yea.I had some experience"
"Allright Listen up you'll be transfered to Precient 22 Tommorow well
discuss our plan to save Noble mans wife"said the cheif
"But aint it too soon?"asked Ping
"He wouldn't think that we would try to rescue her tommorow so c'mon on."

The next day came and it was a fine morning like always at the house of
Masaki..Kiyone had just awoke on the sofa in the living room.She yawned and
looked around
"Hey what the?"she said
"Kiyone your awake."Mihoshi said
"What happened?What happened to head quarters and where's Ping?"Kiyone asked
Not before long G.Asake,G.Kamadake,Ryoko,Ayeka,Ryo-oki,and Sasami entered
into the room
"Hey your awake.I bought you breakfast in bed"said Sasami,handing Kiyone a
tray of food
"Thank you Sasami"said Kiyone,eating the food then she was rudely interupted
when Ryo-oki jumped on her and said
"Meow meow meeeow"
"Oh I miss you to Ryo-oki"Kiyone said
"Hows it been?"Ryoko asked
"Fine"replied back Kiyone then Ryoko gave her a creepy smile and asked
"Soooo who's this Ping guy"
"Just a freind"she replied back
"Oh I seee"Ryoko said
"Miss Kiyone you have been gone for a long time"Ayeka said"We thought you
would never come back"
"Yes thank you for all of you to be waiting for me"said Kiyone"But I must go
and find Ping"she got up,But then G.Asake stoped her
"Miss Kiyone You must stay here and rest before you leave"
"He is right"G.Kamadake said flaoting beside G.Asake"You must rest before

"Thank you for your concerned but I must go"Said Kiyone
"But Kiyone you haven't even finish your breakfast yet."Sasami said
"I know I'm sorry but I have to go and see what happened to

She was about to walk through the door when she saw Noboyukie and Tenchi
eating breakfast at the table.
"Good morning Kiyone"Tenchi said
"Yes welcome back Kiyone"Noboyukie said

"Are you leaving allready?"K.Kamadake asked
"Why so soon Lady Kiyone?"K.Asake asked
"Something came up."Kiyone said
"Oh I see"they both said"Good luck"then they both let her pass.
"That reminds me" Kiyone said "Where's my ship?"
At that moment Mihoshi walks outside and then said nervously
"umm Kiyone you know while you were asleep,I bought you here by your ship."
"Yeah so where is it?"asked Kiyone
"Uhhhh eh heh heh its uhh it at the bottom of the lake"
"WHAAAAAAAAAT"Kiyone said,she looked at the lake where she only could see
the back part her ship up,and then she fell to ground.Washu walks by and
notices the event.
"Looks like somebody needs my help"Washu said
"Yeah thanks Washu"Kiyone said while she was still on the ground

Meanwhile back at the 22nd precient Ping and around 2,000 other officers are
discusiing over the plan.The room was dark that Ping was in and the two
cheifs are showing slides of Jun Pao and his pass outlaw operartions.
"This is Jun Pao"said the 22nd precient cheif"He has killed 3,000
oficers,Hijaked 2,500 ships,performed 178 bank roberies,he has also
kidnapped 98 people,and not to mention he attacked head quarters."
"He is not to be taking lightly"said the original cheif"He is armed and
dangerous I repeat he is arm and dangerous"

"YES SIR!!!!"The officers yelled
"Allright"said the 22nd cheif"The grand marshell heard of this operartion
and he gave it a go"The named of this operartion is Dragon Hunt and the code

DID!!!" Everybody rush to their ship but before Ping got on his,he ran up to
the cheif and asked.
"Sir I was wondering if I could bring my freinds into this I 'm sure they
are useful"
"What"said the cheif"We are about to leave about in 1 hr.Well who are they?"
"I'm sure you heard of them."said Ping "They were the 3 that worked along
