Tenchi in New York - Chapter 1 : "The Cop With The Light Hawk Sword"

Disclaimer: I don't own any characters except Braden. The people
behind the Tenchi gang are Pioneer, AIC, and Viz Comics. Now that I
have told you who owns them, please don't sue me, all I have is a bed,
a TV with a VCR, about 50 tapes for the TV, an expensive stereo,
and about $120. Oops, have I said to much. I also don't own any airline
names. 
 
Foreword: This story is full of wacky, silly, stupid, idiotic, and funny
things. I have come
up with some jokes and stuff to hopefully make you laugh. If you
wonder what < > means
its what they're thinking, ( ) is an action being taken or something is
happening, and 
[ ] tells where they are. And now time for the fic flick. 
 
[ It was a nice day in Okyama, Japan, even at the Musaki residence ]
 
Tenchi: Today I graduate from college, Ryoko, so could you please
wear something else.
 
( We see Ryoko in a dress as if she was ready to watch someone
graduate from college )
 
Tenchi: Now remember you two, NO FIGHTING. 
 
Ryoko and Ayeka: We don't fight anymore.
 
Tenchi: Good, I'm really proud of you.
 
( Braden walks in, he looks in every way like Chandler from Friends )
 
Braden: Wazup.
 
Tenchi: Ryoko and Ayeka don't fight anymore.
 
Braden: Yes they do, they come over to my house, I haven't been able
to sleep for days.
 
Tenchi: Now there will be no fighting when we go today. Got it.
