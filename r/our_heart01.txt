Our Hearts

    Ryoko let out a soft and tired sigh.  She had been listening to
Noboyuki and Yosho talk, about something, about someone, about Aeka,
Tenchi, and herself.  They were saying that Tenchi needed to choose.
After she heard that, she teleported to the roof.
    If only they knew,  Tenchi already did, but she did not know who.
That was her problem.  She needed to know! NOW!  She let out a few sobs,
for herself, for Tenchi, for wether or not she was going to lose Tenchi.
 She shivered at the thought of loseing him.  All of a sudden Ryoko
remembered when Kagato came, when Dr. Clay came, then Yahzuka, then
Kain, and last but not least,Hanerah.

    "Dinner!"  Sasami chimmed.

Ryoko was startled, but soon recovered, and went down to the table.
When she got there, Tenchi, Sasami, and Washu were already there.  That was
surprising, Washu always eats in her crazy lab!  Oh well.

        "Well, hello there, Little Ryoko!  Aren't you going to come and eat
with us?" Washu smiled.

        "Well, hello there, MOM!  I didn't acually think you cared!?  You
could
at least stay out of my mind!"

        "But Little Ryoko?  I'm your mother, I'm supposed snope in your
thoughts!
Anyways, you were thinking so much, I had a headakce! Man, have you ever
cosiderd
going to a MENTAL school!?"

        At this, Tenchi stood up and tried to calm them down.  "Ryoko,
Washu, please
calm down?  You shouldn't act like this!  OK?  Now, lets just try to have a
normal dinner for once.  Sasami cooked this nice meal for us, so lets wait
for
grandpa, dad, Mihoshi, Kiyone, and Aeka.

        While he was talking, Aeka came in and heard enough to get at
Ryoko.  She
smiled and walked in.  "Yes Ryoko, stop being a rude, good for nothing,
demon.
You don't even treat your mother the way you should!"

        "That's Demoness princess, anyway, you should talk!  You call your
mother,
MOMMY!"  Then Ryoko changed her voice to match Aeka's, and "Oh Mommy! Hold
me!
Hold me!  MOMMY, I LOVE YOU, MOMMY!"

        Tenchi let out a small, loud, moan.  "There goes another dinner!"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Later that night, Tenchi went down to the kichen to get a snack
before he
went to bed.  But, when he got there, he wasn't the only one in the kichen.
Ryoko
was there drinking sake. She was probly drunk. Or. so he thought.

        "Hi Ryoko. Are you OK?"  "Yea, Tenchi.  Hey, wanna drink?"
"Ah, you know, mabe I shouldn't, I still have to go to bed, and I have to
wake
up early so I can get a head start with chores tomorrow. K?"

        "Oh Tenchi, Please. It's just a small drink, pretty pretty please?"
Tenchi looked at her, he couln't say no and look at her hurt face.  "OK. I
will,
but only a small one, OK?"  "Sure!  Here's an extra cup. Here."

        She pured him a cup, he drank it and wanted more. So, she gave him
more.
        "Ryoko?" He slurred.  "Wanna goes outite and looook at the wake and
dink
paere, eaaassseee?"  "Sure Tenchi. Come on Tenchi, lets go."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Ryoko was watching Tenchi as he laughed and laughed and laughed
about
a small joke, that had nothing to do with anything he said. "come on
Tenchi,
lets get you to bed, come on, lets go."  "tut Ryoko?  ki wanna kay." After
he finished he passed out, or so Ryoko thought.  She didn't mean to make
him
drunk, she just wanted him to have a drink and to relax.  Now she had to
drag
him to his room, and tuck him in.

        As Ryoko was laying Tenchi in his bed, she started thinking about
what
Yosho and Noboyuki were talking about.  "Tenchi needs to choose."  "Oh
well"
she whispered.

        As she tried to turn around and leave, something, or rather someone
stopped
her from leaveing.  "Tenchi? What are you doing?  Come on, go to sleep. Let
go,
alright?" She whispered.

        After she was finished saying that, he pulled her to him, and
kissed her
forcefully, trying to get more of her on the bed and trying his hardest to
get
on top of her.

        "Tenchi!" She hollered and moaned at the same time.
"...please...oh...Tenchiii.
...let...go..." She breathed.  "Ryokooo, come on.
I...want...you...sooo...baad. Ryoko?
Have...uh...I...ever...told...you...how...much...I...love...you?"

        When he said that, Ryoko pushed herself off the bed and stared down
at him,
but after only five seconds, he grabbed her wrists and pulled her down to
him...again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The sun was shinning, the birds were chirpping, and Sasami was
cooking better
than ever.  But, the sound of birds, the shine of light, and the smells of
breakfast
woke Tenchi up, and in-to a grumpy mood.  He soon relized that he was
having a hangover.
        “Man, I told Ryoko not to give me too much saki, now I’m late for
chores!”
He sat up and was on his way to get off the bed, when he noticed that he
was not alone
in HIS bed, he jumped when he started to have flash-backs of last night, in
bed, with Ryoko.
        “Ahhh!  Ryoko!? What are YOU doing in MY bed, and we both don’t
have any clothes on!”
        “Uh? What? Ahhh!” She screamed.  She got the blankets and pulled
them over her so
that she could at least cover HER-self up, but not Tenchi. “don’t ask ME!
I don’t kno...uh,
I think I’m gonna throw up!”  Then she jumped out of his bed, phassed into
her clothes, and
ran to the bathroom.
        This left Tenchi alone and confussed.  He only rememberd
flash-backs of what happend
last night.
        “Well, Tenchi, you should hurry and put your clothes on before the
others come and
wonder what exatly all the yelling was.”  “Washu, you won’t tell the
others, will you?”
        “No!  Of course not!  I’m not THAT cruel, am I?”  “Thank you.”
“you want to know
why Ryoko puked?”  “Well, it would be nice to know.”  “She’s pregnet, with
your baby, because
of last night.”  she looked over at Tenchi, who had a big sweat drop on his
face, and a mouth
opened, or rather dropped to the floor.  “Tenchi, I’ll check on her for
you, so you had better
shower, dress, and get down to breakfast, and Tenchi?”  “yes?”  “HURRY!”
“OK!”
        “Oh, and one more thing...”  “Yes, Washu, what is it?” She smiled
really sweet, and,...
“DON’T GET MY DAUGHTER KNOKED UP AGAIN!” He jumped with a sweat-drop. “YES
MA’AM!”

To Be Contiued...
