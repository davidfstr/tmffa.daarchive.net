 Disclaimer : i don't own any part of Tenchi Muyo and
 i just write about it so don't sue me.

 Note:	This takes place two years after the movie 
 "Tenchi Forever" I saw the movie my self but i'm 
 going to give him the body he had in the paralel 
 world plus the abilities he had in the first OVA 
 and in addition I'm my change a couple of things 
 because this takes two years after the movie and 
 their characteristics may vary especially Tenchi's 
 characteristics because after being tugged on for 
 so many years I think my characteristics would change 
 too.


		  **A Stroll Through Hell**
            Part 1 act 1 The beginning of the end  
			
               ~Tenchi's room, deep in thought~

 All right I've spent lots of time on this decision 
 whether I should or not. Should or not? Should or not 
 what? Should I marry one of the six women in this house 
 and make them eternally happy or continue to put them 
 through the stress and terror of not being my wife. Should 
 I choose to one so that all the other women mourn at the 
 fact that they weren't chosen or try and keep them happy 
 at the current position that they are already and we all 
 marry somebody else? I kind of consider them my family from 
 the sky. I just don't see what's so big about being my wife 
 I mean when I see a nude woman my nose bleeds until I nock 
 out from blood loss or not getting enough blood to my brain. 
 The only reason I didn't do that when I was with Haruana was 
 because I was in a trace that kept me from remembering 
 everybody, kept my nose bleed down and made me love her. I'm 
 not fully trained in the use of the light hawk wing so in less 
 I've gotten into a really bad mood because some guy has racked 
 them up to a wall and was torturing them I can't assure the top 
 of my strength so I can only hope that the enemy is weaker than 
 I currently am or in the future where I'm fully trained and can 
 protect them with all my strength mad or not. I have a lot of 
 good traits too but these are all just personality traits and 
 would be useless in a fight though there isn't a fight planned. 
 But in any case here are my traits (boy I feel silly talking to 
 myself as if I was talking to a rock) 1: loyalty that may help 
 in a long fight but otherwise useless in that case. 2:carefulness. 
 3: sternness 4: a large amount of humility, caring, and love. 
 Though I'm always being put to the test of being the keeper of 
 these attributes in the everyday grind of a drive through hell 
 because of my physique, character, and who knows why. One you 
 might think I'd have gotten use to is the "demonic due" or more 
 commonly known as Ryoko and Aeka along with their daily house 
 recking plus the "try to tear off Tenchi's arms" game. I have to 
 choose one out six women and when I choose that one that begins 
 the rest of my life but... but I just don't want marry one of them, 
 its... its just that they feel like family and sure as hell you 
 don't walk up to your sister and pledge eternal love... well in 
 Aeka's or Sasami's case it's that way but I'm not from their 
 culture and I don't do it that way. I don't feel that way about 
 them and don't feel that way about Kiyone, Ryoko, Mioshi, or Washu. 
 They just feel like family, people I could stay with for the most 
 of my life and personal life. .........    ............ ....... ....
 .... ... ......... hmmmmm. Uuuuuuhuuuu. Mmmmm. Well that's it 
 huuuuuh I've figured it out! They feel too much like family and 
 I refuse to marry any one of them... wait I wouldn't feel awkward with 
 Kiyone so I guess that's it but I'll go to college first and if I find 
 somebody there I'll take it with them but Kiyone is a must after college.

			~Two Hours Later~

 Sasami: hey dinners ready... Tenchi, Aeka, Ryoko, Kiyone, Mioshi, 
 Washu, DINNER!!! (Walks towards the stairs and trips)

 Sasami: ooohhhhh its so hard to walk in this body its so out of 
 balance. Too much wait on the top and my legs gets gradually thinner 
 as they go down to the feet.

	        ~Five minutes later, dinner table~

Tenchi: huuuuuh (said in a sigh like form)

Sasami: Tenchi, is there something wrong?

Tenchi: well in fact I do have something on my mind but what I was
going to say might hurt your feelings and everybody else's.

Aeka: Tenchi I'm sure we can handle it.

Tenchi: well if you say so Aeka... well I've decided to go to college 
and to try and find somebody new but if that fails i'm going to choose.........

Ryoko: (gloomps Tenchi) oh Tenchi I'm so happy you finally decided to
choose me but you should of known that it will be impossible for any woman
to get near you those darn hussies, because I will be there twenty-four seven 

Aeka: (smashes a stick on Ryoko's head) please Tenchi continue.

Tenchi: well as I was say that woman is Kiyone (Tenchi reaches out and 
grabs her hand)

Aeka / Ryoko: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU PICK HER OVER ME YOUR KIDDING ME RIGHT!

Kiyone: what? Who? Me? (blushing brightly)

Mioshi: OOOOHHH KIYONE I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU YYYEEEAAAAHH!  

Sasami: oh... oh my... oh well. (I feel sick but...)Ki... Kiyone I'm 
happy for you.(Sasami starts to sniffle and a tear drops)

Aeka / Ryoko: (I'M GOING TO KILL THAT LITTLE SLUT!!!)

Tenchi: oh dear god they look like there on fire... I knew this would 
happen (OH MY GOD HOW AM I GOING TO HOLD OFF BOTH OF THEM AT THE SAME 
TIME I'M ONLY SO STRONG)

                     **A Stroll Through Hell**
      Part 1 act 2 the beginning of the ending of this family

		      ~Forest Training Ground~

 Yosho: Tenchi! Enough practicing it time to clean the shrine. Then you 
 may leave for home... oh and you have my blessing for you and Kiyone. 
 And Tenchi don't forget you must try and keep your anger down I know 
 your losing that touch but I don't blame you.
 
 Tenchi: what!? How did you find out?

 Yosho: I have my ways.

 Tenchi: oh. Well, you always do.

 Yosho: yes, now move along Tenchi

 Tenchi: yes grandfather.

 Yosho: Good............ ok I think its safe now, thanks for telling 
 me.

 Washu: hmm all right I bugging out, I'll give info if I get my hands 
 on 
 any thing again.

 Tenchi: (walking up the stairs) I thought he had some agent thing 
 going I guess Washu would be the appropriate person for the job she does 
 like getting paid for doing practically nothing she's got cameras everywhere
 its good thing 
 I got the wings they help put out those darn things its good I took computer 
 class along with technology in high school its good to know how to make electro 
 magnetic pulse (EMP) when Washu is around.

 Washu: So that's how he does it hmm, I could create something to surpase that 
 problem but then my communication to the spy camera would be fuzzy and I wouldn't 
 be able to get every thing well now I'll have to research something get pass that 
 but that's nothing for the (puts her index fingers to her cheeks) greatest scientific 
 genius in the universe. 
 
 Tenchi: (Stands at the Misaki shrine) oooooohhhh some much work to do, it never 
 ends, get up at 6:00 eat breakfast tend the fields eat my lunch, leave fir the 
 forest training ground, get beaten around a little bit, back up 100 fight of stairs 
 and start to broom the floor of the Misaki Shrine and home this is to much I hope it 
 will be easier at college. Man will it be fun no more fighting of this and that those 
 crazy girls just me, myself and I. I bet all those so-called thugs from the college will 
 be a breeze to fight in the training center. I really don't wan to marry any one of them 
 or they'll get really pissed off; and just want to have a normal life with some person  
 where I can be happy, I did get a piece of that life but that was a mirror dimension I 
 want a real life like that.

 Kiko: Don't we all?

 Tenchi: Huh, oh welcome to Misaki Shrine the keeper is not here right now but 
 any problems or confessions that you want to explain I am well enough to handle 
 and help; is there any thing you need.

 Kiko: no thank you but is there an area where I can get some water?

 Tenchi: it's over there (points to faucet in the small shrine) would you like 
 specially prepared tea instead.

 Kiko: of course if you'd take the time, please?

 Tenchi: hold on. 

 Tenchi walks off into the shrine and comes back with a plate with a summer style 
 tea cup

 <This refers to real Japanese teacups, in the summer the teacups are small because 
 of the heat, in the winter cups are big because of the cold>

 Kiko: thank you.

 Tenchi starts to go around and sweep the ground with the broom, dust and dirt flies 
 off of the ground into a cloud and covers the Misaki Shrine.

 Kiko: KOOF KOOF!

 Tenchi: (use his light hawk wings to filter the area of a two millimeters around his
 head) oh, here (takes out of his pocket and tosses a folded fan at Kiko.)

 Kiko: thank you.

 Tenchi: no problem (continues to sweep the ground)

 Aeka: give me it back!

 Ryoko: no ya little stuck up!

 Aeka: it is for Tenchi and not meant to be wrecked by you!!!

 Ryoko: (flies up into the air) aright then catch! (Ryoko takes the present and tosses 
 it the a half a mile way)!

 Aeka: That was for Tenchi, oh you!

 Ryoko: Tenchi would never want you!

 Aeka: we will see about that just let me give him his present, yes then we will see
 about it!

 Ryoko: yeah if ya get to it!
 
 Tenchi: (puts his face in his hands) my god don't they ever stop.

 Kiko: fans of yours.

 Tenchi: burdens more the word.

 Kiko: heh heh heh, hey I'm going to college too maybe will see each other.

 Tenchi: why are you out here then.
 Kiko: well I had some time and wanted to get free of it all.

 Tenchi: you choose the right place.

 Kiko: I'm glad... ..... ..... ... your cute.

 Tenchi: WHAT?!

 Kiko: it's not bad.

 Tenchi: you right, it's not bad but you got keep it down.

 Kiko: what do you mean?

 Tenchi: I'm talking about those two over there.

 Kiko: your devoted fans.

 Tenchi: yes those people, they'll kill you if they hear a comment like that. Heck  
 if they see you here having a conversation with me they'll interrogate you.

 Kiko: (a smile cover her face) you would stop them (winks) wouldn't you?

 Tenchi: I could try but there are two of them... (stops sweeping) well I'm done.

 Kiyko: huh, oh well I'm done here, I've got to go.

 Tenchi: its not usual that we get people like you here please come again.

 Kiko: here's something to remember me by. (gives him a flirting smile)

 Kiko stands up turns to Tenchi bows to him and leaves. Tenchi stands up looks 
 around and starts back home.

   
		      *INTERMISSION*

		**A Stroll Through Hell**
		 Part 1, act 3 The Chase.

 Kiyone: hmm I wonder what it would be like to be with him, oh but that's silly 
 he'll find somebody he likes, oh but what if it is me?

 Ryoko: I don't think you'll find out (creates beam sword) but for your sake I'll 
 tell you the answers to your questions he'll find somebody else, me, not you and 
 my life will be prefect with him with me. (Brings the sword up to her neck)

 Kiyone: (use's shield to nock the sword away) all right, attempt on a civilian's 
 life plus attempt on officer's life lets see who this goes over with the people  
 back at G.P.

 Ryoko: (pulls the sword up) the people at G.P. don't have to know, it will be 
 just between me and your carcass.

 Kiyone: (socks Ryoko in the stomach and runs) you'll have to get me first!

 Ryoko: Damn!... she hits hard but she doing exactly as planed. (Drops to the 
 ground and disappears)

 Kiyone runs by millions of trees as she searches for Tenchi.

 Kiyone: damn it!!! Where's Tenchi when you need him. (goes up the stairs and falls 
 to her knees by accident)

 Aeka: hey! Kiyone!

 Kiyone: (turns her head to see Aeka in the bushes) huh, oh, Aeka you have got 
 to help me.

 Aeka: its Ryoko isn't it but don't worry come on.

 Tenchi walks towards the house when Ryoko flies out sword in hand.

 Ryoko: KIYONE!!! COME OUT!!! (Ryoko flies away)  

 Tenchi: holy shit! I knew it!
 (follows Ryoko to where ever Kiyone was) 
 Aeka: look over there. (points to the right)

 Kiyone: (looks in the direction pointed out) what I, don't see it?

 Aeka: look closer.

 When Kiyone is not looking Aeka hits her with a stick and drags her off.

 Ryoko: HUH, oh great you got her meet you in the cave. (disappears)
 Tenchi: damn it lost her. Hmm, oh the cave huh, will just see who is behind this 
 (Tenchi runs, jumps off the tree limb and heads towards the cave.)

			~Two minutes later, in the cave~
 Kiyone: huh? What... what happen? Oh, my head hurts. Aeka. Where are you? 
 (Opens eyes) what the  hell am I doing inside Ryoko's cave? 

 Aeka: it's a pitiful thing to lower myself to this but I won't allow you to have 
 Tenchi.

 Kiyone: WHAT!?!? 

 Ryoko: you played it out perfectly.

 Kiyone: What do you mean played it out perfectly. 
 (notice's she restrained to the wall when she tries punch and run again.)

 Ryoko: you pack a wallop in that fists. But to answer your question; me and Aeka 
 planed this out  Aeka looks to  up-right to do a thing like this and if I scared you 
 well enough you'd go looking  for Tenchi, but if you found Aeka we knew you would ask 
 her to help might help. Then when you'd  leas expect it she'd hit you over the head 
 and drag you off to here.

 Aeka: we knew that if you had "left" Tenchi would pick another and Ryoko and I where 
 determined  to chose one of us.

 Kiyone: this is not going to be good to your heath Aeka you know how Jurai deals with 
 traitorous  acts as for you Ryoko G.P. is going to be pissed of when they hear what you 
 did and you could be locked up for along time or until Nagi finds you.

 Aeka / Ryoko: Who's going to know?

 Kiyone: G.P., when I don't come to the monthly report.

 Aeka: I could tell them that you were K.I.A. during a mission in your earth job.

 Kiyone: Mioshi?

 Ryoko: HAH! Well say the same thing to her except that this time we'll also say that 
 you were  the only one to be assigned to the job, she's such a bumble head she'll fall 
 for it.

 Kiyone: ("their probably right", her eyes get wide)
 Tenchi!!!

 Aeka / Ryoko: we done enough training to trick him into believing us. 

 Tenchi: (walks out of the corner he was hiding in) Yeah, well I think I've heard enough 
 of this  junk to last me the entire time!

 Aeka / Ryoko: huh, Tenchi?!

 Kiyone: (struggles to get free) oh yeah, now your in for it!
 Tenchi: PLEASE, TELL ME THE LOGIC IN KILLING KIYONE!!!

 Aeka: oh dear.

 Ryoko: umm... well... uh hmm... TENCHI YOU MUST MARRY ME OR... OR......

 Tenchi: or what Ryoko, you'll kill Kiyone and make me hate you! Is that what you 
 want?! Do you  want me to despise you for what you did?! Well you haven't done it 
 yet but you're about to! I  really don't like you right now don't try me any further!

 Aeka: but ten... (is cut off by Tenchi)

 Tenchi: and you Aeka, your royalty, what the hell do you think your doing! Ryoko 
 doing this,   well I must say I'm little not surprised but you... you of all 
 people! Jeez, I mean come on I'm  starting to think all that royalty is making you 
 greedy!

 Aeka: oh, Tenchi! I'm sorry.

 Tenchi: sorry is not going to cut you and Ryoko have been causing havoc for the last 
 5 years! Do  you know how high strung I am with all of that! and now this?!?!? 
 Please show me the logic in this, please?!

 Ryoko: sorry, I'm very sorry (floats away)

 Aeka: I shall see what happens to me in court. No more will I stay here I, 
 promise that. (with   that she runs away.

 Kiyone: Tenchi help me! (struggles more)

 Tenchi: hold on Kiyone.

 Tenchi runs over to Kiyone to unlock her from the wall but finds he needs a key.

 Tenchi: Damn it! Need a key. Stay very still Kiyone.

Kiyone: ok.

 Tenchi creates one light hawk wing. He changes it to look like an exacto knife 
 grabs it and slowly cuts the chain. Kiyone falls from the wall onto Tenchi and kisses 
 him. 

 Kiyone: Oh Tenchi! You saved me, but what about those two. (Hugs him tightly)

 Tenchi: I don't know Kiyone, I just don't know.

	       ~Twenty minutes later, Tenchi's bed room~ 

 Kiyone rests her head on Tenchi's chest.

 Kiyone: good night.

 Tenchi: good night

			End of part 1

 Next time: well its time for Tenchi to go to college to get away from it all but what
 is "she"  doing there. I'm sure you know who "she" is.
