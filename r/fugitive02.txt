The Fugitive Part 2: The Court

	"Tenchi Masaki you are now charged of the deaths of Kito Masaki 
your daughter, abusing Ryoko Masaki your wife, killing Noboyuki Masaki 
your father, and killing Yosho Masaki your grandfather.  This court has 
been adjourned."  
	They yanked him outside into an airplane.  When he was inside he 
looked at everyone else they looked like serial killers or worse.
	"Oh, I know you.  You're that guy who killed his daughter.  You 
also blew your father up they found the grenade ramparts.  You also 
stabbed your grandpa to death they found the knife that killed your 
daughter and grandpa near the place where your grandpa's corpse was.  
And you abused your wife."  Everyone was looking at him then he added, 
"If you don't die from ol' smokey then you'll be killed by your 
roommates.  You see they can't handle people who kill their children.  
Hey! Watch out."  At that second Tenchi ducked and a fist went flying 
it missed but he was at such force that it hit the window and busted it 
out.  Three prisoners were sucked out into oblivion.  Tenchi was sucked 
out but he hung onto the window's edges.  The force was too much.  The 
pilots had called out a mayday.  Tenchi couldn't hold on much longer.  
He was by his middle and index finger.  The plane went through 
turbulence.  He was forced to let go.  He was sent flying in the earth.  
He felt that he would lose his guts and that he would vomit at the same 
time.  The force was gut wrenching.  He almost missed it but he held 
onto the wing.
	Finally, when the plane landed he got off the plane and ran.  He 
ran and ran and ran.  He ran to the woods and yelled.
	"I got to get back to my wife!"
