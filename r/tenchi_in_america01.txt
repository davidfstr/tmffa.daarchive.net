Chapter one No Need for Leaving 


	'Tenchi TENCHI !!!" Noboyuki said. 
"What Dad " tenchi  yelled  "How would you like to take a little vacation"
"Umm yeah why do u ask?" "well Tenchi I've been asked to design a building in America
and I am to fly out there right away."
	"what about the others?" Tenchi asked
"They can all come" Noboyuki  responded  I will tell every one at dinner tonight.

	Well dinner came and the surprise Noboyuki had surprised everybody.
Ayeka, Sasami  were the most surprised. "so when are we going Sasami asked?"
"We leave tomorrow" tenchi said.
Now Ryoko and Washu and Kiyone and Mihoshi asked What State is it?
"Well umm I Think its called Ohio" tenchi said In a city called Cincinnati. We have plenty of 
money so there will be  a lot to do. The man who asked me to build the building will
show you all around.
"Wait a second where's Grandfather dad lets go to the shrine to tell him. 
Tenchi and Noboyuki went to the shrine. Father Noboyuki asked would you come to America with us?
"I don't know" grandfather said 
PLEASE Noboyuki begged 
"Alright I will come" Grandfather said 
"Pack up we leave in the morning" Noboyuki said 
They both returned to the house where all the girls were packing up.
"Tenchi start loading this stuff up in the car."
Ok dad Tenchi said 
Three hours later the entire luggage was loaded and tenchi fell over and went to bed. 
The next morning they got to the airport Ayeka and Ryoko fought over the window seat
but then the plane took off and they were on their way
