people- (waits for the wild applause)
Astrophe: (unenthusiastically) *claps*
Evil: You're supposed be my moral support, you know- since Morwen apparently 
*failed* in that department.
Astrophe: ...Well, you need to answer something that has been bugging me ever

Twilight Dreams


By: Evileyez



	Sasami had just finished preparing for tonight's date.  Walking past her 
sister Ayeka, who'd been writing in her journal as Sasami got ready, she said 
good bye and left the bedroom to join her date downstairs.  Ryoko seemed to be 
gone again- this time with Ryo-Ohki.  (I wonder where she left to?)O0o. thought 
Sasami as she walked down the staircase.

	At the age of twenty five Sasami was a very beautiful woman and looked 
much like the reflection of her "other" self, Tsunami.  Suprisingly, the 
assimilation process had not finished yet and Sasami seemed very much like her 
own self- not like the Tsunami she would become a part with.

	Over the years, her girlish crush for Tenchi grew into love.  Somewhere 
along the way, Tenchi returned it back to her and they began dating.  (*giggle* 
I guess he finally made his own choice for once)O0o. she thought.  In the 
beginning, she at first had been unsure whether or not to "formally" go out with 
Tenchi- as both elder sister Ayeka and Ryoko liked him as well.  Yet both their 
reactions had surprised her.  Ayeka took it very well- she seemed happy for her 
and even now she would listen to all of the stories Sasami would tell her about 
what had happened during their dates.  She had seemed so understanding when 
Sasami would tell her, her hopes and worries of Tenchi.  Ryoko... now she had a 
*bit* of a problem with this relationship and had exchanged bitter words with 
Sasami, but now seemed to accept it- though the feeling of big/little sister had 
never been the same after that.  .o0O(I'm happy with Tenchi...but sometimes I-
...I wish that-)

	"Come on Sasami!  We might be late to the movie if we don't leave right 
away!" Tenchi called from outside, interrupting her thoughts.

	"I'm coming!" she replied, and her troubling train of thoughts vanished as 
she went out the door to leave with her beloved.


*****3 hours afterward*****


	Sasami ran up the stairs to her room- the night had been so much fun!  
(Wait till Ayeka hears what Tenchi did by accident at the fair- she'd fall of 
her chair laughing too!)O0o. were her thoughts.  She turned to her door and upon 
opening it, found that her sister was fast asleep in bed.

	(How pretty she looks tonight...more so than normal)O0o.  Indeed, the 
Princess *did* look extremely beautiful.  The shimmering light of the full moon 
fell upon her pale white skin and shone on her unbound, purple hair like she was 
the Sleeping Beauty of old.  For Ayeka seemed to give off an unearthly glow in 
this dark room and had fallen, fast asleep on her futon.  Walking inside the 
room, Sasami noticed that Ayeka slept even before putting away her journal- it 
was left open for the whole world to see.

	Tiptoeing over to Ayeka's futon, she carefully picked it up, hoping Ayeka 
wouldn't wake up at the same time..  <_< >_> (No one's looking...and I'll just 
take a little peek...besides, Ayeka *did* leave it out in the open...)  
Apparently, Sasami had not grown out of her curious and mischievous old self.  
(Hmmm...lets see what she wrote for today- after all, she spent a LONG time 
writing this night.)O0o. she said to herself as she opened the journal.

*****

As I write this, Sasami leaves for her date with Lord Tenchi.  "Will she have 
fun at the fair tonight?" I ask myself.  I hope she does...yet- a part of me 
hopes she wouldn't, that she would wake up tomorrow and hate *him*.  Leave 
Tenchi so that only I could comfort him and give away all that love I have 
solely for him.

I hate myself for thinking that way, it's disgusting.  I am Sasami's sister and 
I should be happy for her...

But... don't I have a right to feel even the least bit envious for that "what 
if"?  No, I am Sasami's older sister and I *will* be happy for her sake...even, 
even if it is not the truth.  NO!  I must prevent myself from thinking such 
thoughts.  I am truly happy for her taking away my love's heart- stop this 
Ayeka!  You *are* happy for your little sister.  What is done is done, and the 
love you have for Tenchi is long gone- and if some still stubbornly refuse to go 
away bury them.  Bury them deep like you did before, bury them with all of your 
old hopes and dreams for they are useless now.

Yet, don't *I* have a right to still keep them, those dreams and hopes of mine?

No, forget about them, for they are worthless to you and will only serve you 
pain; forget about *him*.  Forget about Tenchi like you have done with Yosho.  
Yosho...how much it hurts that you still believes that I have not figured it 
out- that you still are as young as ever and that you just DO NOT want me?  Not 
just once, but twice!  Both you, Yosho, *and* Lord Tenchi!  Why?   I must know 
why Fate does not give me her favor and why Love chooses to ignore my innermost 
wishes!  For you, Ayeka were doomed to fall in love with no one to catch.  I was 
meant to have loves never returned, a one-sided game.  No one truly cares!-

No, Ayeka, dig another hole, deeper this time and bury them all.

Cover all that hurt with those false masks that you have become an expert at 
making.  Those smiles and laughs ring hollow in my ears though!  But, everyone 
else believes you! It works!  Then...*why* do I still wish for people to see the 
me underneath?  A lonely princess who buried herself *with* the hopes and 
dreams...and hate.  At least my dance at the ball of masks has not ended.  
People believe me as happy and I AM- but, I might as well stop dancing with the 
mask on.  It hurts...

I was wrong earlier.  My dance *is* ending, as nothing lasts forever.

Remember, Ayeka?  *You* made the deal.  *You* were the one to ask for yet a 
different path to take- a one way deal.  *You* were the one who stated "no 
regrets", right?  For you *still* refuse to give up that wish for all of your 
old hopes and dreams- even with *this* as the price.

I will give up everything for it- even with *this* as the price.  I 
wonder...will it hurt?  Looks so beautiful, this thing of mine.  And the 
apothecary...who could've guessed?  For both directly, and indirectly has *both* 
of them driven- no, affected my path.  I *will* do this- for I have no 
regrets...though I wonder if anyone would care when it happens.

Yes, for the sake of "living" once more do I do this, where I can hold all my 
wishes will I do this!

There, I took it...it tastes strange- my mouth tingles and now I feel so light-
headed.  So sleepy...I'll be able to dream now...but-...Tenchi...Sasami, forgive 
me for-

*****

	The journal slipped out of Sasami's hand unnoticed- she felt too much 
shock to react to what she just read.

	(She, she *wasn't* happy all those years?  What is she talking about- she 
*wouldn't* have still loved him, she told me herself!  How could I know that she 
felt this way!?)O0o. thought Sasami.  Suddenly another mind awakened in her 
thoughts: [You knew.] (What?!  If I did then-) [You knew how your sister felt 
about him when you were younger and knew that she would never get over him so 
quickly.] (No!) [Yet you denied reality and chose to believe in Ayeka's false 
demeanor.  Like she said, indirectly affected her to do *this*].

	"No!," Sasami cried out, "Ayeka is just sleeping!  Ayeka...".  She bent 
down to Ayeka's still figure and shook her.  "Ayeka...," Sasami whispered, tears 
streaming down her face, "wake up and tell me you have played a joke on me... 
Ayeka!"  Ayeka now lay on her back and her face could be seen- a peaceful face 
(When is the last time I saw her face look like that while sleeping...? And... 
was that the tiniest bit of a smile?) of death.  In her cold hands a tiny bottle 
lay, empty.  Shaking her more, Sasami began to panic.  "Tsunami was lying, Ayeka 
so wake up!  Please...this isn't funny!  Ayeka-" [I never lie to you Sasami.  I 
know what she has done for I am the one who gave her] (YOU!) [She would never 
have been the same anyway, Sasami, living a life with false emotions is not 
living.  I gave her something that would make her happy...forever...] (Never 
be...)

	Sasami's sobs echoed through the silence of the night.

	"Ayeka...why couldn't you just *tell* me?" she sobbed- looking out to the 
night sky, where a star faced its last stages of life, a supernova.  Wiping away 
her tears, she thought, looking at her older sister.o0O(Maybe...maybe it's 
better this way.  I want her to be ha-) but couldn't finish the thought as more 
tears came .o0O(Ayeka...)

	And Ayeka dreamed.


End


Astrophe: Gosh Evil, you *really* felt evil today...why'd you kill her?
(voice from window outside):I didn't kill her!
Astrophe: *walks over to the window and shuts it* Now as the closing part of my 
hosting Jef- err Evil's fanfic, I shall say that "Twilight Dreams" is a text 
copyright of Evileyez, 1999.  However, Tenchi and co. DOES NOT belong to "it" 
since it's AIC's and Pioneer's.
(voice from doorway):I will not take being called an "it"!
Astrophe: So you'd rather be a "sheast"?
Evil: NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Astrophe: *Walks over to the door and slams it shut on Evil's face* Later 
peoples! *blinks out of existence as you push the 'back' button on the browser*
