David J. Thompson proudly presents:  "And now for something completely
stupid"
Ch. 1: "Stupid is as stupid does"
***************************************
        It was a dark and stormy night, well maybe not that stormy, but it
was
damn dark.  All alone in the domain of man, the sanctum sanctorum, a
solitary figure sat at a desk mercilessly typing away.  "Ah yes, this is
just what this fic needs, a healthy dose of self insertion, and some
really bad puns!"  said the lone human.  "But I seem to have no real
meaning for this to happen, plot twist time!!".  All the while he was
drooling over his keyboard, he didn't notice and odd blue glow emanating
from his mirror at the back of the room.

Back in the Techiverse: "Damn!!  This thing never works!!"  said a
certain red haired super-scientist whom we all know and love.  "Maybe, if
I calibrate the tachyon field and add some bipolar energy to the mix..."
Her words were cut short as a large explosion ripped through lil' Washus'
dimensional sub-space lab (TM).  Washu stood there, now a very blackened
red haired super-scientist whom we all know and love, cursing like a
drunken sailor.

        Back in the real world, Dave continually typed away (I guess I
should've
introduced him earlier).  Ever so slowly, the blue glow immersed him and
tightened.  Dave gave a sharp cry that was cut off by his lack of air.
Never before had he felt so close to death than at that moment.  The blue
glow drug him toward the mirror (The ONLY way to get into alternate
dimensions) and was brought fully into the mirror.  A darkness enveloped
him.  He had a sensation of falling, falling, falling.

        "Now I hope this works"  said Washu as she typed some buttons on her
translucent keyboard.

        The falling continued until Dave lost consciousness.  His last
thought
was, "Crap, now I'll never finish my fanfic!"
****************************************
        Washu grinned as bolts of energy crackled over the examination
table.
The energy assumed the form of a falling person (I wonder who).

        Dave landed with a CRASH.  He felt the clang of cold steel on his
body
as he fell onto the table. Gradually, he re-assumed consciousness.  He
finally came to, and immediately was overcome with a massive headache.

        "ARGH!!!  DAMN!!"  He said, clutching his head.

Gradually, the pain faded and he began to get his bearings.  He was in a
large room, with many large tubes that seemed to stretch into eternity.
Many gadgets both interesting and undefinable came into view.  And in the
midst of all this machinery, there was a small woman standing in the
shadows, with an evil little smirk on her face.

        Suddenly, a spotlight from nowhere appears over her.  The woman
lifted
her head up and laughed.  The woman began speaking quickly in Japanese.
But Dave (Being an American) could only pick out a few words here and
there.  In response he stated "Sumimasen, wakarimasen" (Sorry, I dont
understand).  The woman seemed a little annoyed at this and quickly
brought up her translucent keyboard.  "Wait a minute, translucent
keyboard?" thought Dave.  "This is beginning to seem to seem familiar."

        Suddenly, there was a small blip sound and the woman looked up and
said,
"Better for you?"

        "Oh yes, domo" said Dave as he wondered why this place looked so
familiar.  Without warning, the revelation came to his head.  "TENCHI
MUYO!!" he shouted, startling the woman.  " I'm in the Masaki
household!!"  Washu, though, couldn't understand what he was talking
about.

        Dave, realizing what he had just said, quickly regained his
composure.
"Oh, very sorry Washu" said Dave.  This startled her even more "How did
he know my name?" thought Washu.

        "Very well" she said, "You've come a long way just to intrude upon
my
lab, you have 5 seconds to explain yourself"

        "What if I don't want to?" Dave said coldly.  "Then I will skin you
alive, cut off all your arms and legs, subject to you countless hours of
sexual torture, then I will KILL you" Washu replied.

        Dave stammered "Well, before you do, could you at least let me pay
my
respects to Tenchi and Ryoko and the others?"  Washu became incredibly
suspicious.  "Because I feel I have some sort of purpose in coming here"
"Oh yes?  And what purpose would that be?" Washu said.  Dave thought
quickly, "Umm, my purpose here is to give you that 'Sample' you've wanted
for so long!"

        "Oh really?"  Washu said slyly.  "And what if I told you that you
weren't the correct specimen?"  Dave was trapped.  "Umm, I'D USE MY
GODLIKE POWERS ON YOU!!"

        "Godlike powers eh?  Heh heh, prove it."

        Now Dave was really trapped.  "Uhh, for one thing, I know that your
name
is Washu"

        "That has been shown" Said Washu, clearly not impressed.

        "Ok, uh, I know the names of the occupants of this house: Tenchi,
Ryoko,
Ayeka, Sasami, Noboyuki, Katsuhito (Yosho in the OVA version), Ryo-o..."
"Huh?" Said Washu, interrupting his listing.  "What the heckaroo is an
OVA?"

        Washu really had his balls in a blender now.  He had to think of
something fast.  He had to think of something that Washu wouldn't detect
as a lie.  Something she wouldn't suspect.  Something like... "Uh, I
dunno.  Do you know?" Washu just stared at him with a blank face.

        "I must discover what this 'OVA' is"  She said as Washu sped towards
her
computers.  Breathing a sigh of relief, Dave quietly crept of the table
and through the dimensional sub-space door, careful to close it as quiety
as possible.

I hope you're enjoying this right now, cuz I had a lot of fun making it.

Stay tuned for Ch. 2, "Dare to be stupid"!!

Oyasumi Nasai!
