OAV-isation side story

From:	iac@umich.edu (Luriko-Ysabeth)



The OAV-ization is on temporary hold due to crashage of drive and loss of
word processor. The new version should be out soon.

Meanwhile.... I wrote a dream sequence on the plane coming back from
winter break. This is -- well, can be -- Sasami's dream the night
before they leave for Tokyo. It is not to be taken as canon, even
psuedocanon the way "Tenchi-Muyou! Ryoh-oh-ki: in Love" attempts to be.
(Translation: there's a LOT of speculation here, you may disagree with
most of it.)

Sasami no Yume

Tsu: You've tried to influence all the worlds, haven't you?

 To: And you, of course, have not?

Tsu: To what purpose?

 To: I doubt you'd understand. You always set your sights too low.

Tsu: At least I don't overextend myself. I'm happy.

 To: Happy! And I suppose *she*'s happy?

Tsu: Now, yes. And you really can't reassemble *her* until she recombines
     of *her* own accord.

 To: That *idiot*. I've sent out people to find *her*, wherever.

Tsu: Do you know that *she*'s found most of herself already? *She*'s even
     numbered the universes one through four, in the order that she
     discovered them in.

 To: I don't even know why I bother to waste time in speech with you.

Tsu: Odd; that's not what I'd think from your avatars. But why must you
     make them so destructive?

 To: What do you mean, destructive?

Tsu: Misao/Misa. Yuugi/Sakuya. They're all yours. They're all you. Why do
     you hate Tenchi so much?

 To: Who's Tenchi?

Tsu: Don't be deliberately obtuse.

 To: Does one "hate" a stray marsquirl, to speak on your chosen level?

Tsu: It has been known to happen.

 To: You bred him deliberately, didn't you?

Tsu: Thank you for your input.

 To: I assure you, it is unintentional. And you have not yet answered my
     question. I must know!

Tsu: I suppose you'll just have to accustom yourself to disappointment.

 To: You did deliberately send him to rescue *her*, though.

Tsu: *She*'s my sister too... for all you might notice.

 To: And just what is that supposed to mean?

Tsu: Whenever you're with *her*, the two of you go off into your own
     little world -- even when you stay in ours -- and don't notice the
     rest of us.

 To: That is not true.

Tsu: *Isn't* it?

 To: And I have no idea why certain of my avatars latch onto yours.

Tsu: Truth lives in the darkest heart.

 To: And why have you taught your pets to fear the darkness?

Tsu: Now you are the one speaking untruths.

 To: Oh? Then why did the oh-so-mighty leaders of Jurai call out their
     little guards when I informed them that one of their visitors was
     from the World of Darkness?

Tsu: [angry] So YOU were responsible for her! She might have been killed!

 To: Hypocrite. Your domain is the World of Light.

Tsu: Which you let one of YOUR children get loose in.

 To: A child? Of *mine*? *Hardly*. And I did arrange for it to be caught
     again.

Tsu: I assumed it was your child because it can create pockets of another
     world in this one -- the way I can create pockets of this world in
     the World of Darkness through *my* children.

 To: You couldn't do that if *she* were here.

Tsu: But *she*'s not, is she?

 To: She ought to be. She and her daughter.

Tsu: And *your* daughter?

 To: She's not my daughter, if you mean my mouthpiece in *her* first
     world.

Tsu: Oh, you did know. [pause] So what *is* she to you?

 To: Why should I tell a small-timer like you?

Tsu: Unhelpful as always. You don't even help recapture your creation.

 To: If you've trained your pets properly, why should I need to?
