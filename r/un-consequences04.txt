Chapter #4: Dining Conversation 
*(Note: A Change in title had to happen as you'll see in the story!) 
On this day Lunch time at the Masaki house would be remembered for many 
years to come.  
Because, on that day, A young man named Tenchi Masaki took his destiny 
and those of the two women he loved into his hands. As the family 
gathered for lunch Tenchi, Ryoko and Ayeka, entered with big smiles on 
all their faces. They had let go of their hands before entering,but 
those there saw the emotions on their faces and most knew something 
important was going to happen. 
A Katsuhito sat on one end of the dining room table, while Nobuyuki sat 
on the other.  
To Katsuhito's right were seated, Ayeka, Tenchi, and Ryoko. Facing 
them, next to Katsuhito was Washu, Sasami, Ryo-oki, and then 
Mihoshi,who sat next to Nobuyuki.  
As lunch was served by Sasami and Mihoshi, and compliments were given 
for the fantastic food prepared by Sasami, everyone enjoyed their 
lunch.  
  
As lunch was coming to and end, Tenchi nervously stood up and when all 
eyes were on him he cleared his throat, and took one look at both Ryoko 
and Ayeka who gave him reassuring looks. 
"I have an announcement to make!" He then motioned for both girls to 
stand up, and then he took one of each of their hands. "I have been 
thinking of this for a long time, but I haven't been able to face this 
till yesterday." (He squuezed their hands and smiled at both of them, 
they did the same.) "Yesterday made me confront my feelings for both 
Ryoko, and Ayeka. It made me face my true feelings, so I have Proposed 
to Ryoko, ... and Ayeka to be my brides!" 
There was about five seconds of silence,               Until almost all 
of them yelled, got up and hugged and congratulated the trio.  
After the congratulations subsided, two couples started looking at each 
other. One couple looked at each other with happiness, while the other 
had some apprehension exchanged between them

Late afternoon 
As the sunday afternoon sun started to set, the members of the Masaki 
clan relaxed in various ways.  
Tenchi Ryoko, and Ayeka were at the Onsen. They had gathered to 
celebarate with Sake' and a litle more kissing and hugging. Though 
hesitant at first, Tenchi was enjoying the conversation he was having 
with his fiances. They talked about what they wanted to do for the 
summer. Briefly, Ayeka mentioned Jurai and his chance to become 
Emperor. But Tenchi politely told her that they would discuss that 
another time,saying that "This is a time to enjoy you too here and 
now!"  
Ryoko was laying her head on Tenchi's chest, ans was Ayeka opposite 
her. They contin ued like this relaxing and making out until 
dinnertime. 
While they newly engaged trio were in the Onsen, Mihoshi and Nobuyuki 
were taking a walk in the woods that surrounded the house and the 
shrine. They had taken their time as they had been walking for most of 
the afternoon, admiring the scenery and wildlife that abounded there. 
On sunday's many Japanese families take walks or go to parks to enjoy 
the outdoors. With that, both of them wore traditional clothes.Mihoshi 
who had dressed in a traditional green and gray kimono, while Nobuyuki 
was in a Men's black and gray kimono.  
For most of the afternoon, they engaged in some small talk , mainly 
about their backgrounds and their big and unusual family. As it started 
to get later they walked up to and past the shrine. Nobuyuki had been 
working up the courage to get to this spot with Mihoshi whom he had 
next to him . They were arm in arm as they turned to Achika's 
tombstone. 
"Mihoshi, can you please wait here, I have to do something here ok?" 
asked a hesitant Nobuyuki.  
"I don't mind Nobuyuki. I would be happy to wait for you", was what she 
had said as he made his way toward the tombstone of his deceased wife.  
As he knelt down and said a prayer to his wife's well being in the 
afterlife he slowly began to speak. 
"My darling Achika, I have much news to tell you."(He looked down for a 
few seconds then continued.) "Our son has finally made his decision, 
and you would be so proud of him my darling.  
He not only chose one of the girls, he choose two of them, Ryoko and 
Ayeka." (He then wiped some tears as he continued.) "I am so happy my 
love, we have raised such a kind and loving son. And with his future 
wives, I know that he will have an exciting and happy life with them." 
He took a breath and went on.  
Your father and Ryoko's Mom Washu are getting closer, but you know your 
father, and with him you have to have a strong woman to have his 
attention. Well Washu is strong and wise. I hope they can work through 
their quirks to maybe get together to help each other as I think they 
should." 
He then took a full minute as he tried to get his thoughts straight. 
Then he spoke.  
"My love, I'm sure from your vantage point you have seen what has 
happened yesterday night."  
He hesitated somewhat, but continued. "I love you Achika, and I will 
always keep you in my heart. But, a bright and loving soul that has 
gotten my attention. Mihoshi is such a kind and considerate woman. I 
have admired her inner beauty as she has lived here with the rest of 
us."  He paused again. 
I have come to ask you if you would allow me to court Mihoshi 
Kuramatsu, with the intent to eventually make her my wife." There is a 
silence as he waited for he himself to know how his Achika would have 
answered. He didn't have to wait long. 
Beside Mihoshi appeared Tsunami in her traditional robesd and finery.  
She was smiling an then called For Nobuyuki's attention. He turned to 
face the goddess and Mihoshi standing next to her. 
"Noble Nobuyuki, I have heard your request." (She said with a smile) 
"Normally I do not involve myself in such requests, but this is a 
special sort of request. I think I can help you get your answer." 
She then jestured with her hand towards him as Mihoshi watched with an 
astonished look.  
As Nobuyuki turned towards the goddess, he felt a presence behind him. 
There in front of him was his wife in her astral form in her favorite 
blue kimono, smiling that smile he remembered and loved. 
"Oh my love!" he tried to hug her, instead he fell to the ground right 
through her.  
"Nubi, still doing things before you think, my love." she exclaimed.  
After he picked himself up and had a blush of embarrssment, he calmed 
down and started to speak.  
He turned to Tsunami, Bowed and said; "Thank you oh mightly Goddess for 
granting my humble request." He then turned back and faced his wife's 
spirit. 
Achika, My love, I have to tell you that I... was..." 
"Nubi," (She tried to hold his face in her hands) "...I  know what 
happened, and I know with who"  
(She looked at Mihoshi with kind eyes) I also understand the feelings 
you two have." she motioned Mihoshi to come and stand next to Nobuyuki. 
The she looked at him again."I will always love you, but you need 
someone here,...with you." Achika looked down. "I wish I was there with 
you now," an astral tear was seen down her cheek. "But I can see that 
Mihoshi has a good soul. I trust her with giving you the love you need, 
the love you diserve. So, I will give my blessing to the two of you, 
and may you have a long and happy life." She tried to hug both of them, 
but her arms went through  them. They smiled at each other, then as 
Achika turned to leave, Mihoshi said;  
"When we die, will you be there for Him,... for me?"  
Achika then gave a big smile and replied; "Of course I will. Its the 
least I can do for my sister-wife!"  
She winked at Mihoshi. Then she turned back to her husband who was now 
crying. "Don't cry my love, have a good life with Mihoshi, and I'll be 
waiting for you two when it's done, OK?"  
 She motioned for Mihoshi to gently grab and lead a distraught Nobuyuki 
away. 
As the "New" couple left Achika turned to Tsunami and asked;  
" Will I be able to keep an eye on them, my goddess?" She bowed to her.  
Tsunami smiled and replied; You can keep an eye on them until they join 
you Lady Achika, and please call me Tsunami. They linked arms and 
started talking about their little family and the changes they were 
going through as they faded from view.

Katsuhito had taken a solitary walk after the chaotic lunch was over. 
As he walked, Washu had taken some specific supplies and headed for the 
shrine office's sitting room.  
When he completed his walk an hour later, he headed for his office. 
When he opened his sliding door he was momentarily amazed. 
There in front of him, was Washu in a classic pink kimono, and a 
Japanese tea service.  
"Lord Katsuhito, will you honor me by joining me for tea?" Asked a 
formal and adult Washu.  
How could I not refuse such a kind and proper request. I will be 
honored to." Replied a now stoic Katsuhito. 
As they drank their tea Washu was bidding her time for the proper time 
to ask her questions.  
since before the fateful incident the day before, she had been wanting 
some answers from this thoughtful, but serious Priest and ex-Prince of 
Jurai. 
"May I ask you my Lord some questions?" Washu finally asked him.  
"Yes, Miss Washu, you may." answered Katsuhito.  
Why can't you return the affection I have for you? Is there something I 
did wrong? Well, except for yesterday!" Said Washu.  
After a few moments of contenplation, he answered. I am nearing the end 
of my existance, why would you want to be with me, Washu when you know 
that I won't be here for long, whay would you want to waste you time 
with me. A loud SLAP was heard in the Shrine office. 
"Who do you think you are to tell me what and how I feel! I thought you 
would have understood that I, being who I am, would have taken the time 
we had and kept you alive, maybe even extend it just to be able to 
spend more time with you. But, I must have been mistaken." (She looked 
down for a moment) It seems I have a lousy way of picking men to love, 
they either leave me, try to imprison me or just simply try to keep me 
away for my own good. 
She got up to leave when a hand holding her arm stopped her. Then a 
young Yousho gathered her into his strong arms as she beat on his chest 
with her hands and arms yelling as she did. That lasted at least 20 
seconds until a tired and crying Washu settled down into his arms. He 
rocked her back and forth saying soothing things as she calmed down . 
He the spoke; "I am an idiot not to take into consideration how 
strongly you felt for me, and my misgivings at having that kind of 
attention. It's been many years since that has happened. (he sighed, 
and looked into her evergreen eyes) I do wish to make it up to you lady 
Washu," (He finished wiping her face of tears) "so I'll split the work 
load with you for the rest of the week."  She finally smiled her 
trademark smile, then she Thought of something. "Well, whay dont' we 
... she whispered something to Yousho that made him fleetingly blush 
red. Then he nodded, gathered her up in his arms and then, they headed 
towards Yousho's bedroom with Washu giggling all the way down the hall.  
  
Chapter #5: The Waiting Game  
How do the various lovers  handle the anxiety of waiting until Washu's 
lab re-opens. Then to top it off The Jurai Royal Family comes for a 
visit! 
Author's Notes: To My pre-readers Andre Laval, and Tex James, many 
thanks for all your help as my stories you both edited have been 
accepted to TMFFA! To my readers, some have said that Ayeka isn't 
B***hy enough, well I don't see her being that unless she gets angry. 
Now in this story, she is much happier more times than angry. But, 
don't worry some of our traditional Ayeka will comeout soon enough! 
Thanks to all and please R & R!
