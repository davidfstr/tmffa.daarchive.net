A Tenchi Muyo! Short Fic
--------
[Ryoko enters the kitchen, opens the refrigerator door and digs into the
food supply of the Masaki residence]

Ryoko: Aw, Isn't there anything to eat around here.

Sasami:  Ryoko, stop messing in my kitchen.

Ryoko: Since when did this kitchen became yours?

Sasami:  Since I'm the one doing all the cooking here.

Ryoko: A mere technicality.

Ayeka: [Enters] I don't suppose you can cook, Ryoko?

Ryoko: Of course I can.

Ayeka: Ho ho ho ho. That'll be the day.

Ryoko: Humph.  At least I can cook for Tenchi, unlike some princesses I
know.

Ayeka: Arrrgh! Alright, Ryoko.  What did you mean by that?

Ryoko: Listen, get off my butt you...old maid.  I'm hungry.

Ayeka: Who are you calling old maid, I'd like to know?!!

Ryoko:  Hey, I don't see any other old maids around.

Ayeka: AAAHH!!  Ryoko!  I'll get you for that!

Ryoko: Yeah?  You and the whole Jurai military could try...again.

Ayeka:  Aaaaah!!! I can't take this anymore.

Ryoko:  Come on...Give it your best....

[A knife lands on the kitchen table, making the two stop for a second]

Sasami: [removes her apron]  That's it.  I'm not cooking anymore.  [Walks
off]

Ryoko: Huh?

Ayeka: Sasami?

Sasami:  I'm leaving the kitchen to the two of you.  Good riddance. [Exits]

Ryoko: Ayeka?

Ayeka: Ryoko?

Ryoko: Today's Tenchi's birthday.

Ayeka: I know.  What do we do?

[Later]

Tenchi: Wow, you made all of these?

Sasami: [smiling] Ah, ha.  But Ryoko and Ayeka helped.

Noboyuki: Did you say, Ryoko?

Washu: And Ayeka?

Mihoshi: Wow, these look delicious.

Sasami:  Yes.  I'm sure glad they offered to help. [grins and looks back at
the kitchen]

[Inside]

Ryoko:  Stop complaining and start washing. [wipes the oven door]

Ayeka: This is all your fault, Ryoko.

Ryoko: My fault?

Ayeka: Yes.  Why did you ever agree to my little sister's arrangement.
[washing some pots and pans]

Ryoko:  Coz, we both know we can't cook.

Ayeka:  [sigh]

Ryoko:  Hurry up, or we'll miss the party.

Ayeka:  I wonder why Sasami insisted in getting the kitchen cleaned before
the party started.

Ryoko: Beat's me.  Who knows what she's up to?

Ayeka: [stares at Ryoko] Ryoko?

Ryoko: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

[Voices from the Living room]

How's that, Tenchi?

I think I've had enough, Sasami.

Try this chocolate cake I made, just for you.

Ok, but only if I also get to serve you some.

Sure.  I'd like that, Tenchi.

Ryoko & Ayeka:  SASAMI !!!!

[End]


No need for C&C - get it?

This has been a recording

@ Yes, I know this is a bit flaky.  But I've got to start somewhere.
Besides, I'm sure this had been done before.

@ Yes, Virginia...I'm back.  Might as well, since Zen froze hell all over,
I've got nowhere to go.

@ To those that had been waiting for a fic from me...yes, that Ranma
thingie...Remember, I'm a helpless romantic.
