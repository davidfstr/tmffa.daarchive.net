<[The lights go up and we see Azaka and Kamidake standing in front of a red 
curtain.]
Azaka: Good evening, and welcome to the special episodes of Tenchi Muyo!  Ryo-
ohki!
Kamidake: This story, which uses characters owned by AIC and Pioneer, not the 
author, picks up where the three part OAV prequel "Opening Moves" (which the 
author strongly suggests you read first) left off.  In that, we watched the 
three goddesses prepare for their inevitable conflict.  The story ended with 
Ryoko's attack on Jurai, but instead of what we know happening, Prince Yosho 
died at the end.
Azaka: I think there's only one proper response to that: Holy ****.
Kamidake: I'm glad we agree, Azaka.
Azaka: Now, without Yosho, Tenchi will never exist either.  Note: We are under 
orders from Princess Ayeka and the author to attack anyone who cheers about 
that.  [They glance warily in the direction of the Two Guys' and K'thardin's 
respective websites.]  The author wants to make it clear that he did not remove 
any characters because of a dislike for them, but merely because they do not fit 
in the story.
Kamidake: With Tsunami's plan an apparent failure, what will happen next?  Will 
the universe be safe?  Read and find out!
Azaka: You won't even have to pay admission until after the show.
[The two pull back the curtain.]
Kamidake: You know, in this scenario the title Tenchi Muyo! actually makes 
sense.
Azaka: [Pause] I guess you're right.>

Tenchi Muyo!

Test of Faith

Chapter One: Unraveling Tapestry

	The world was dark.  It always was.
	This was simply a fact of her life.  In her world, darkness was the way of 
things.  The funny thing was, although it was dark, there were still bright 
pictures.  People walked past every day.  Priests performed ceremonies and 
cleaned the area.  People came forward asking for blessings.  Occasionally they 
even ventured inside.  None of these images were real.  At least, not to her.
	Close your eyes for a moment and try to form a clear picture in your mind.  
Images flash by faster than the mind can keep up.  None of them are real.  The 
real world still surrounds you, and the world for her was darkness.  With 
reality's constant intrusions, it is near impossible to force an image to stay 
clear in the mind.  Had she the will, she might have been able to hold her focus 
on some of these visions, but none of them ever caught her interest.  They were 
just pictures in her head.  How was she to know that they were real?
	She had no desire to escape.  Escape had no meaning.  Life was being in 
the darkness.  There was a time when she had been out in the light.  She 
remembered that time clearly, but it was just an image in her head as well.  The 
darkness was reality.  How was she to know that it could change?  She had no 
desire to escape.  It turns out, though, that sometimes personal desire, or the 
lack thereof, is not the strongest of forces.
	It had been around 700 Earth years since the one who had been called Ryoko 
(she didn't call herself that- she never thought to call herself anything) had 
been sealed away.  The power of Tsunami had imprisoned her.  The power of Washu 
would release her.
	The gems had been growing for twenty millennia.  By this point, their 
strength had grown enough to challenge Tsunami's seal.  The sword and the gems 
were fighting for superiority.  The sword seemed to be winning, but the gems 
only needed a tiny crack to claim victory.
	The wall of the cave started to crack, then slammed shut again.  Ryoko saw 
a flash of light and was stunned.  This wasn't a picture inside.  It was like 
the pictures were becoming real.  The light disappeared but then came back.  She 
had to know what this was.  She flew towards it, then into it.  The crack in the 
wall was a mere sliver, not large enough for a wide worm, but with the seal 
broken she phased through.
	Ryoko was in the outer cave now.  it was dark still, but there was some 
light coming from down the tunnel.  Where was this new place?  She felt as 
though she had been amputated.  Why didn't she have her gems?  How could she be 
alive without them?  Then she heard voices from the light.  People!  Coming this 
way!  What to do?  Stripped of all will, the most basic of instincts surfaced in 
her: survive.  When it came to people, that meant only one thing: Run!  She dove 
through the ceiling of the cave into the chilly, pitch dark night.  The cold and 
the dark didn't bother her, but the city full of people below did.  She flew 
away, as far as she could go before exhaustion overtook her.

	Princess Ayeka heard a pneumatic hiss and felt a warm wind blow in.  She 
dully noticed a scratchy voice.
	"All systems activated," the voice said.  "Unlock the time-freeze now.  
All systems synchronize to bridge standard time."  Princess Ayeka moved her lips 
slowly as feeling returned to them and opened her eyes.  She stepped out 
hesitantly, wearing her ornate robes, and walked onto the circle for the ship's 
commander.  It was strange, to be awake again.  She glanced at the clock on the 
bridge controls that told her she had been in hibernation for around 700 years.  
She looked out at the blue and white planet, which had grown large in the 
window.
	"What planet is this?"
	"Colonized planet number zero three one five," answered the deep voice of 
the blue-marked Azaka. "Earth."
	"Then this is where my brother Yosho is!" piped Ayeka excitedly.
	"No, what we detected from this planet is Ryoko."
	"Huh?" said Ayeka, her face falling, then developing into a venomous 
scowl.  "Not that woman.  What does this mean?"
	"We have yet to detect Yosho's ship, but he was in pursuit of Ryoko," 
answered Azaka.  "Logically , it would follow that-"
	"I see," said Ayeka, cutting him off.  "That woman and Ryo-ohki must be 
caught and tried formally by our planet Jurai as soon as possible."
	"Princess Ayeka, unfortunately all of Ryoko's crimes were canceled by 
statute of limitations nearly two standard years ago."
	"What?"
	"The statute of limitations has taken effect, and Ryoko's galaxy wanted 
file has been erased."
	Ayeka felt anger run through her.  She could still remember everything 
that that woman had done.  Now she was expected to let her go free- on a 
technicality?  "Answer me, why is it!"
	"The statute of limitations is based on decisions made by the Holy Council 
of planet Jurai, and-"
	"That is not what I have asked!  I want to know why that woman is not 
sought for all eternity!"
	"The statute of limitations is based on decisions made by the Holy Council 
of planet Jurai, and-"
	"Never mind.  That woman is our only clue.  We must capture her at all 
costs."
	"But the statute of limitations-"
	"That's an order!  We will think of a reason later."  The ship turned 
towards the Earth and began its descent.
	"Be well, my dearest Yosho.  Please be well."
	It took only a few minutes to arrive at their destination.  "Are you sure 
this is where she is?" asked Ayeka incredulously.  She was staring at a dark, 
uninhabited mountaintop.  It was coated with snow and pelted by fierce winds.  
"I thought for sure that she would surround herself with hostages."
	"We have detected a number of minor imaginary space jumps and antimatter 
based energy discharges from this general location," answered Azaka coolly.  
"The people on this planet have no way of generating such phenomena, so Ryoko is 
the only plausible source."
	"I see.  She's on top of the mountain, then?  And you are certain that she 
is alone?  What about Ryo-ohki?"
	"We have yet to detect any signs of the Ryo-ohki.  Ryoko is the only 
lifeform in the vicinity."
	"Very well, then.  We will deal with Ryoko first.  Have the ship form a 
force field around the mountaintop so she cannot teleport out.  We will then 
approach ourselves and take her prisoner."
	"Yes, ma'am."
	"And be ready for anything."

	Ryoko was sitting on top of the mountain, shivering.  Her nude body was 
desperately thin. Every one of her bones was visible.  Her eyes were sunken in 
and darting around wildly.  Her hair was thin and falling out.  There was dried 
vomit across her abdomen.
	It was cold on the mountaintop.  She had never gotten cold before, but now 
she was.  She couldn't understand all of the new sensations or what she was 
supposed to do about them.  The strongest of them was an ache in her stomach.  
What did it mean?  In the past, she had always known what to do.  Now she was 
confused.  Maybe she was just supposed to feel the pain.  Somewhere in the 
farthest back corner of her mind came a suggestion: Eat something.  Eat?  Why?  
She had seen other people eat, but she had never done it herself.  Maybe she 
would try that, if the pain kept going.
	Ryoko jerked her head up at the sound of snow crunching.  A woman in heavy 
robes was walking towards her with two floating logs on either side.  She had 
been trying to run away from people, but here was another one.  She lifted off 
and flew away, but was hit with a fierce shock and fell back to the ground.
	"Don't think about running, criminal," said the stranger.  "I've got you 
surrounded."
	"What's going on?  What to do, what to do?  Can't run, what to do?"  Her 
words came fast and without pausing, as if she was chanting to herself.
	"You're going to tell me now," she said, walking closer.  "Where is my 
brother?"
	"Fight?  Maybe fight?  Can't fight, won't win.  Can't fight, can't run, 
nothing to do but hurt."
	"Stop these games, criminal!" she shouted, grabbing Ryoko by the shoulders 
and shaking her.
	"Ah!  Let go, gotta run, can't run!"  The stranger jumped back and looked 
over Ryoko for the first time.  Her sharp eyes widened and the scowl on her face 
seemed to disappear.
	"I expected a deadly criminal.  What happened to you?"  Ryoko simply sat 
there shivering. "Take us back to the ship."
	"Yes, ma'am."

	Ryoko was held in a protective force field and placed on a bed. Ayeka 
looked over her frail form.
	"Get an intravenous needle and give her some nutrients.  She looks far too 
weak."
	"Are you worried about her?" asked Kamidake.
	"Of course not!" she snapped quickly.  "It's... just that we need her 
alive.  For the time being, that is."
	"Of course."  Kamidake attended to the prisoner.
	"And keep her on the bridge so we can keep an eye on her.  Azaka, where 
did the first signs of Ryoko show up?"
	"She first appeared in a cave in a midsized city near here."
	"Drop me as close as you can to the city.  I imagine we'll get more 
information there than from her gibberish."  She took off the overly ornate robe 
she was wearing to avoid drawing attention to herself.
	"Since it is night time, we can safely place you within the city.  From 
where you land, the cave will be in a temple up a hill."  Ayeka saw the familiar 
lights of teleportation and appeared in a dark street.
	She wandered through the maze of glass and stone buildings for almost half 
an hour, feeling more lost by the minute.  Where was this stupid temple?
	"Hey, baby.  You know, it's not safe for a little lady like yourself to be 
wandering around in the middle of the night."  Ayeka groaned and turned to face 
the speaker whom she had seen following her several minutes ago.  He was a bit 
shorter than Ayeka but he had a thick build.
	"Thank you, but I'll be fine,"  she said, turning to walk away.
	"Don't turn your back on me!"  He rushed at her and grabbed her arm.  She 
spun around and slapped him in the face.
	"Bitch!" he yelled, pulling out a knife and lunging at her.  He slammed 
into a force field a few feet in front of her and fell backwards.  He dropped 
the weapon from his hand and his jaw dropped as well.
	"Now," Ayeka said, smiling sweetly as she gingerly stepped forward and 
held his chin in her hand, "perhaps you would be enough of a gentleman to tell 
me how I could reach the temple?"
	"Gg- I- you-"
	Ayeka scowled.  "Answer me, ruffian!"
	"Temple!  Temple, f-four streets down, turn left and up the hill," he 
stammered.
	Ayeka smiled again.  "Thank you, dear."  She then hit him at the base of 
the neck- a light tap for her, a consciousness-stealing blow for him.
	Following the thug's directions, she found that they did indeed lead to a 
temple.  It was a steep hill, and she had to take high steps to ascend it, but 
at least the road was paved.
	She reached the summit slightly winded.  A square stone temple sat in 
front of her.  Ayeka stepped forward and knocked on the door.  A few moments 
later, it cracked open and was answered by a young man in white robes.
	"May I help you, miss?"
	"I was told there was a cave here that I would be interested in seeing."
	"Oh, I see.  Come in."  He opened the door all the way and ushered her 
inside.  It was a large square room with doors on all sides leading away.  There 
were lights in the ceiling whose glow reflected orange off the smooth stone 
walls.  "We have acolytes here twenty-four hours a day, but it's rare to have 
visitors this late.  Especially on so cold a night."
	"Oh, I hope I'm not inconveniencing you-"
	"Not at all, not at all.  Actually, I was hoping to get something to do.  
It does get rather dull at these hours.  I take it you've never been here 
before?"
	"No.  What is this place?"
	"You know nothing of it?" he asked with one eyebrow raised.  "I thought if 
you went to the trouble of coming here... Well, the legend begins seven hundred 
years ago."
	"How many?"
	"Seven hundred.  Why?"
	"I just wanted to be sure I heard right.  I'm sorry, please continue."
	"All right, then.  What happened- well, take a look."  He gestured up to a 
huge stone slab above a door.  It was about twenty feet tall and five wide and 
had kanji carved across its surface.  Ayeka frowned at the words.  While the 
translation chip in her brain was working flawlessly for speech (lucky thing 
this was Jurai territory), it seemed to have no luck with the writing.  "Wait, 
can you not- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean to- Well, the gist of it is 
this: Seven hundred years ago, a great star fell from the sky, flattening the 
mountains.  People went to look and were led to a cave.  Outside the cave was 
the body of a young man.  He was believed to have been a saint come to give us a 
sign.  They- as the text puts it- 'sent his body to the gods in ash.'"
	"Then... he died?"
	"Yes.  He died just outside the cave he sealed.  Some say that those who 
live here pass through this cave on the way to the afterlife.  Whatever the 
case, people were sure that it must be a blessing within, so they began to live 
here.  That is the origin of this city."
	Ayeka could not believe that her brother could have died so easily.  It 
was probably just a bystander who got caught in the crossfire.  "Is there a 
picture of what the saint looked like?"
	"There was a painting made, but it was destroyed in a fire.  Any pictures 
now are pure guesswork."
	"I see.  Where is the cave, then?"
	"Right through that door."  He opened a door opposite the one she entered 
through that led to an open air area.  It was walled in, but the cave entrance 
in the center was untouched.  "I'll guide you in."
	"Actually, if you do not object, I would prefer to enter alone."
	"I suppose that would be all right," he said hesitantly.  "Here."  He 
handed her a flashlight as she walked toward the door.  "Be careful.  And make 
sure you don't touch the sacred sword."
	Ayeka stopped.  "What sacred sword?"
	"Oh, did I forget to tell you?  It's a jeweled wooden sword hilt.  The 
blade itself is trapped in a stone.  Anyone who touches it feels a crippling 
shock, so we take that as a sign to leave it be."
	"Thank you, I'll be careful."  She walked into the dark, damp cave.  It 
sounded like the acolyte was talking about a Juraian key, except for the mention 
of jewels.  Keys were supposed to be kept simple and unornate.  Well, she would 
find out soon enough.
	She reached the end of the tunnel and a larger room.  The only things of 
note were a small wooden houselike structure and a door to a deeper area.  Ayeka 
walked over to the wood structure and opened it.  Resting inside was the Tenchi-
ken.
	"The Master Key!" gasped Ayeka.  "And Yosho had it with him.  So he was 
here.  But what has become of him?  He should be guarding this place."  She 
thought for a moment about what to do next.  "He wouldn't have left this place 
unguarded, so he must still be watching over it somewhere.  He came here on a 
tree ship.  Maybe that ship's memory will hold the answers.
	"I suppose I had better take this with me, then."  She grabbed the key and 
slid it out of the rock easily.  "Hmm, I wonder why the blade is solid.  Oh 
well."  She activated the sword and it shot out of the hilt, shattering the 
rusty blade.  Then she deactivated it and hid it in a pocket of her robe.  The 
back wall of the cave slid open.  "Oh, my!  This must be where Ryoko was kept."
	She headed down the opening and found a pool of water at the bottom.  This 
was quite obviously Ryoko's prison, but with her gone there was nothing of 
interest to Ayeka, so she quickly left.
	Ayeka returned to the temple and found the acolyte who had helped her 
earlier.  "Excuse me, sir, I was wondering if there were any large, unusual 
trees around here."
	"Are you sure you've never been here before?"  She shook her head, a 
gesture that the translator told her meant no.  "Well, it sounds like you're 
talking about the holy tree.  They say it grew from the same spot the star fell.  
As such, it is considered to have grown on blessed ground.  Go out the back of 
the temple and down the path.  It leads directly to the holy tree.  You can't 
miss it."
	"Thank you sir," she said, bowing.
	The acolyte was right.  It was impossible to miss the tree.  It stood 
alone, with no other vegetation around it.  This lonely look was caused by the 
intense nutrient requirements of Juraian trees.  A pool of water encircled it 
with a small bridge on one side.  Ayeka thought for a moment about how powerful 
things always drive others away, but decided that it wasn't worth going down 
that road.  Sometimes she wished she hadn't had to take poetry classes.
	The princess stood under the tree and tapped its trunk with the sword 
hilt.  Bright lights shot out of the leaves and lit the dark night.  Images 
flashed inside Ayeka's mind.  Ryo-ohki and Funaho falling to the Earth.  Yosho 
and Ryoko fighting fiercely, neither one willing to back down.  Yosho's triumph 
over his foe.  And then... his sad, yet peaceful death.
	"It cannot be," she whispered, tears glistening in her eyes.  "I can't 
have gone through all of this just to..." She fell to her hands and knees with 
tears pouring from her eyes.  She punched her fist into the hard dirt, forming 
cracks in the smooth ground.  "Damn you, Yosho!" she howled into the cold night 
air.  "Why did you have to be so brave.  Jurai needed you."  Then, almost 
inaudibly: "I need you."
	"Miss?  Are you okay?"  It was the acolyte.  He ran up to her, panting 
slightly.
	"Please leave me alone."
	"I think maybe you should come inside."
	"Thank you, but I really should be going now."
	"Well, if you must.  But if you need someone to talk to-"
	"Thank you."  She turned and walked away from the temple into the 
darkness.
	"Azaka, Kamidake, bring me onboard," she said flatly.  She was immediately 
teleported up.
	"Princess Ayeka, did you find Prince Yosho?" asked Azaka.
	She didn't answer for a moment.  "Send a message to Jurai.  Tell them what 
has occurred and that we shall be returning shortly."
	"What about Prince Yosho?" asked Azaka.
	"We will discuss that later!" snapped the princess.  "I'm going to my 
quarters now."
	"Tsunami has just entered the system.  Princess Sasami has been brought 
out of suspended animation and is requesting a rendezvous."
	"Tell her that our mission has been canceled and to return to Jurai."
	"Yes, ma'am."

	The blaring sound of alarms jolted Ayeka awake.  She jumped out of bed, 
quickly threw on a light, pink kimono, and ran out of the room towards the 
bridge of the ship.
	"What is the problem?" she asked tersely.  "Why have the alarms been 
sounded?"
	"The ship has unexpectedly fallen into real space," answered Kamidake.
	"We believe that we may be under attack," intoned Azaka.
	"Attack?  By whom?"
	"As of yet," said Azaka, "there has been no appearance by any- Oh, never 
mind."  Out the viewport, an enormous gray ship with multiple layers was now 
visible.
	"By Tsunami, what is that?" gasped Ayeka.
	"Attempting evasive maneuvers now.  Evasion failing."  The ship bucked in 
many different directions but it was unable to break free of the larger ship's 
anti-jumping field.  "The ship is drawing closer."
	"Incoming energy blasts!"
	Ayeka stepped directly into the center of the bridge and connected her 
mind with the Light Hawk Wings, throwing them open just in time to catch the 
volley of energy blasts.  She forced them open all the way to form a protective 
circle.  In this pattern the wings were thinner since the energy was dispersed, 
but it was near impossible to get around.
	"Is there any chance of escape?"
	"Negative, Princess.  The ship's anti-jumping field is too close, and it's 
too fast for us to get out of range."
	"Heheheheheh."  Ayeka jumped at the laughter and the humming sound from 
behind her.  Spinning around, she saw a tall, gray-haired man with undersized 
glasses stepping forth from a glowing green portal.  "Well, if it isn't the 
lovely Princess Ayeka," he said, smiling.  "How do you do, my dear?"  He placed 
his right arm in front of his chest and bowed.
	"Who are you?"
	"I'm afraid I can't answer that question now.  Terribly rude, I know, but 
I need to keep my name to myself.  I'm sorry to intrude on you like this, but 
you have something of mine that I'd like back."  He floated over to the bed 
where Ryoko lay.  "She's not looking very well, is she?"
	"Get off of this ship, now!" said Ayeka, trying to keep her voice from 
quivering.
	"Oh, I will, just as soon as I get what I came for."  He then saw the 
sword that she was absent-mindedly clutching.  In a flash, he flew over to her 
side and tried to grab it, only to feel an electric jolt run through him.  Ayeka 
pushed him away, breaking his grip on the sword.
	"I see," said Kagato, looking at the sword and the gems on its hilt.  
"Very interesting.  Well, I should take my servant and go now."
	"Your servant?"
	"That," he said, pointing to Ryoko.  "It works for me.  I intercepted the 
message you sent to Jurai saying that you had captured Ryoko.  I'm here to 
relieve you of her."
	"Then- you are responsible for the attack on Jurai.  You killed my 
brother."
	"The old boy really is dead, eh?  Pity that."  Ayeka's eyes narrowed at 
his words.  "I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you, princess.  I can't have 
anyone knowing I've reclaimed my prize.  Sorry.  It's nothing personal."  He 
activated his green blade and charged.
	Ayeka formed a force field around her that stopped the blade.  He hovered 
above her, pushing down on the wall of energy.  Then, opening a small hole in 
the force field, she punched him in the gut.  He gasped, nearly doubling over, 
and floated backwards slowly.  "I'll deal with you from my ship," he said, 
grabbing Ryoko and passing through the newly reopened portal.
	"Azaka, Kamidake, send out a distress signal immediately!"
	"We already have, but we are in deep space and it is unlikely that help 
will arrive in time," said Kamidake.
	"In that case, are we within personal teleportation range of that ship?"
	"We are," answered Azaka.
	"Send me there now.  I'll have a better chance against him one-on-one than 
in ship combat.  And I'll take this with me just in case."  She shoved Tenchi-
ken into her pocket.  She couldn't fully access its powers, of course, but it 
might improve her own ability to use Ryu-oh's energy.
	"Yes ma'am!" said Kamidake.
	"Should we follow you?" asked Azaka.
	"You two must continue to pilot the ship."
	"Of course.  Good luck, Princess Ayeka."
	"Thank you."  Then she disappeared.

	Kagato sat at his organ and played.  The music was projected throughout 
the entire ship.  He had opened all of the barricades to him so that Ayeka would 
have no trouble finding her way to the bridge.  She would fight a few drones, 
but he was confident that she would arrive.
	He ended his piece and stood up to face the visitor as she crossed the 
catwalk.  "Hello, my dear.  Welcome to my chapel.  I've been waiting for you."
	Without a word, Ayeka dashed forward and punched him in the chest.  He 
stood still and took the blow without flinching.  Ayeka stumbled away from him.
	"I'm sorry to disappoint you, princess, but you really don't stand a 
chance.  I only let you think you did because I needed you to come here."
	"W-why?" she whispered.
	The pirate grinned at her.  "Why don't I show you?"  The Tenchi-ken then 
activated itself.  Ayeka jumped and gripped the sword tightly.  It twisted 
around and fought against her grip.  It turned towards her and she was forced to 
let go or be sliced open.  The sword floated away, resting atop the large chair 
against the wall.  "You see this ship is capable of controlling Jurai energy.  
It is now in control of the Master Key."
	"Then you have Tsunami?"
	"Tsunami.  And every other Juraian ship."
	"W-what do you mean?"
	"Princess Ayeka, don't play dumb with me.  I know how the hierarchy of 
trees works."
	"That is supposed to be a secret of the Jurai royal family."
	"Well it isn't."  Suddenly an unconscious Ryoko appeared in the room.  
"Now to attend to this one."  The gems were released from the Master Key and 
returned to the appropriate places.  They started glowing once they made 
contact.  "Right now the gems should be rejuvenating her.  They are her life 
force, you see.  You may have noticed that she wasn't really herself earlier.  
She has intelligence but no sentience.  She can understand patterns and how her 
enemies will react but she never really considers why..  She has no self-
awareness and no real concept of others, or of the future, except as they relate 
to her mission.  Perhaps if she had spent some time observing others, she might 
have come to think of them as more than just targets..."
	"So you provide her with a will to do whatever you wish her to?  But how?"
	"The gems are the source of her strength and so can also control her mind.  
And this ship can control the gems because they use the same energy as Juraian 
trees."  Ryoko stirred and stood up slowly.  Her eyes were their old lime green 
color and her body, while still thin, looked much better than it had a few 
minutes ago.
	"Put some clothes on, my dear.  We have company."  Ryoko obligingly phased 
into her red and black battle outfit.  "That's better.  Now, Princess Ayeka, 
there's something I need to discuss with you.  I want to talk about how it is 
that you Juraians are able to use the energy of your trees."
	"I thought you said you were able to use it from the ship?"
	"I am.  But that's rather inconvenient, don't you think?  I can't control 
all of the trees personally.  Can you imagine what a strain that would be?  I 
need a way of allowing others to control them directly for me, so first I must 
understand how this energy truly works.  How is it that someone's blood can 
determine their ability to control energy?"
	"I don't really know," answered Ayeka flatly.  "No one does."
	"If that's the way you want it, maybe I should just have your memories 
drained.  I can extract everything you ever knew.  But that takes longer, and 
it's much less pleasant.  Or maybe I'll just keep you in the dungeon until you 
think of something to say."
	"Dungeon?"
	"An alternate dimension.  It's the exact reverse of this ship.  There's a 
one-way door; I can send people in, but I can't force them out, and I can't go 
in myself because it has to be controlled from out here.  I can keep people in, 
though, for as long as I wish them to stay.  Trust me, you won't enjoy it."
	"Do whatever you want, but it will not allow me to tell you something that 
I do not know."
	"Perhaps not.  But I might just be able to trade you for someone who 
does."
	"Why don't you trade her for me?" asked a young voice.  Ayeka and Kagato 
both nearly jumped out of their skin.  Who was that?  Kagato stared at the large 
translucent screen hanging in the room with the grim face of a young girl.  It 
took him a few seconds to recognize her as the second princess of Jurai.
	"How did you get into this system?"
	"Tsunami hacked in.  She's a powerful ship.  I came her to stop you from 
taking Ayeka."
	"I'm afraid you're too late, Princess Sasami.  I have the Master Key and 
control of the ship you're in."
	"I thought I said that I didn't come here to fight.  I came to make a 
deal.  I'm about to eject from Tsunami and leave this space.  Let Ayeka go, and 
you can have me instead."
	"What's the point of trading one princess for another?"
	"Because you may have taken the ship..." Sasami walked across the room to 
stand in front of a pool of water, revealing the reflection of another.
	"But you don't have me," finished Tsunami.
	Kagato shook his head to make sure he was seeing correctly.  The 
reflection of Sasami was Tsunami.  What did it mean?
	"Seven hundred years ago," said Sasami, her voice quivering a bit, "when 
Ryoko attacked Jurai, Sasami was in the tree room.  The palace was hit and 
Sasami fell to her death.  Tsunami created me as a replacement and moved her 
mind into this body."
	Ayeka stood in quiet disbelief.  Kagato was focused, trying to put 
together the pieces.  Tsunami's head was bowed sadly.  Sasami stood stoically, 
staring at the enemy.
	"You see, you have the body of Tsunami.  I have the mind.  All you have to 
do is release Ayeka- one girl who won't even have access to Jurai energy 
anymore- and you get the mind of a goddess and everything she knows."
	It took him all of three seconds to decide.  "I accept.  Ryoko, will you 
escort Princess Ayeka to a shuttle?"
	"I won't go!" she yelled.  Ryoko was not giving her a choice in the 
matter, and carried her away kicking and screaming.  Kagato chuckled to himself.  
"I always knew emotion was one of humanity's greatest weaknesses."

	Ryoko placed Ayeka in an escape shuttle.  It was programmed to jump in a 
random direction for one light year before turning over control to the pilot.  
As soon as Ayeka entered, the ship pulled away and broke into imaginary space.
	The ship could barely even be called a ship.  It was a tiny space not much 
bigger than a closet with a small control panel from which it could be piloted.  
There was no artificial gravity, so Ayeka was floating in the space trying to 
avoid hitting the walls or ceiling.  The window was black.  Of course, it wasn't 
a real window.  Very few modern ships had actual windows, in favor of cameras on 
the outside that projected screens on the inner walls of the ship, giving the 
illusion of windows.  This protected from unfiltered solar radiation and was 
sturdier than glass, although actual windows could be opened in emergency 
situations.  In imaginary space, the cameras were always shut down.  The images 
that would be captured would make absolutely no sense anyway.
	"Princess Ayeka, I need to speak to you," said a hologram of Tsunami in 
the cramped ship.
	"Tsunami?  How has all of this happened?"
	"Sasami already answered that question.  Except that she was mistaken 
about one thing.  She never died.  I stopped that from happening by assimilating 
with her, pushing my essence into her body."
	"So- you really did just give my sister to that monster?"
	"You are the whole world to her.  She chose to give herself to him in 
order to save you."
	"But she's too young to make that choice!  She doesn't realize what she's 
done.  And you're more important to Jurai than I am."
	"Don't you think I know that?"  Ayeka marveled at Tsunami's ability to 
keep calm in this situation.  "Don't you think it kills me to know what's in 
store for me.  You have to understand something, though.  I could have easily 
stopped Sasami from going through with this.  In my mind, I would have been 
doing it to protect a greater good.  But that's one compromise I cannot allow 
myself to make.  You see, if I were to force someone else to do what I thought 
was right, then, no matter how noble my intentions, I would be no better than 
him."
	"I don't know what to make of all of this.  There are so many questions."
	"I wish I could answer them all, but time is short.  As soon as I am 
taken, this conversation must end.  So listen to me closely.  You are much more 
important to the universe than you think.  I expect great things from you in the 
near future.  It will not be easy, but you mustn't falter in your task.  You 
have to promise me that you will not lose faith."
	"I-" The hologram abruptly disappeared.  "I promise," said Ayeka into the 
empty room.  Then she buried her head in her hands and wept.

<Azaka: That's it for chapter one.
Kamidake: Come back here for Chapter Two, "The Serpent Strikes."  And if you 
read this,the author would appreciate you telling him so at dukesr1@winthrop.edu  
[Pause] You know, Azaka, there was something in there that confused me.
Azaka: What was that, my fine wooden friend?
Kamidake: How did Kagato find Ayeka so quickly?  It took him two months in the 
OAV.
Azaka: That's a good question.  He said earlier that he found Ayeka by 
intercepting a message from Ayeka on her returning to Jurai.  In the OAV, she 
never returned to Jurai so she never sent that message, and it took him months 
to track down Ryoko.
Kamidake: Do we get paid extra for filling the author's plot holes?
Azaka: I'm afraid not.
Kamidake: Dang.>
