Summary:  Introduction to AFS Series

[Disclaimer:  Tenchi Muyo! and its characters are the
property of AIC and Pioneer LDC, Inc. and was created by
Masaki Kajishima.  This story comes entirely from my
imagination, and is strictly intended to be apocryphal--so
please don't sue me.]

     "Those who speak know nothing
     Those who know are silent."
     These words, as I am told, 
     Were spoken by Lao-tzu. 
     If we are to believe that Lao-tzu 
     Was himself one who knew, 
     How comes it that he wrote a book
     Of five thousand words?

ANCIENT FORTRESS SILLINESS SERIES

There comes a time in every young man's life when he must
confront the ancient fortress buried in his backyard--
with or without the help of his beautiful, powerful, alien
girlfriends.  Hmm...  Something amiss in the above statement...

Oh, well.  The point is, Tenchi seems to have problems.
Like any other young man raised in a loving home,
he has to make serious decisions, from time to time.

Then again, I'm pretty sure Tenchi never actually does
make any serious decisions...  Anyway... the upshot of this
series is that there's a lot of trouble, and--by golly--
someone's going to deal with it!  Then again, maybe not...
