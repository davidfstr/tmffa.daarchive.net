No Need for a Kidnapping: Chapter 3
By Chibi-C

Author's notes: Hey peeps! Chapter three is done!
Kyinia: This is a good thing?
You know, I still might write that lemon.
Kyinia: .
I thought so. So, let's get this show on the road.


Why is he going after that demon woman? Ayeka thought sadly 
in her room. Is she more important to him than me?

Baka! Ayeka's inner voice shouted at her.

What?

You heard me. If it were you up there, Tenchi would do the 
same thing in an instant and you know it.

Ayeka sighed. You're right. But still.

Somehow, I think that what you're feeling has nothing to do 
with this incident. Am I right?

What do you mean?

I mean, these feelings have been developing for a while.

Ayeka gasped. Her inner voice was right. She had been 
noticing the way Tenchi had been acting lately. Ayeka 
thought about her last fight with Ryoko.

**Flashback**

"Girls, please stop!"

"Uhh.sorry Tenchi. Guess we kinda got a little carried away 
back there."

"Yes, Lord Tenchi. We're very sorry."

(Sigh) "It's okay, girls. Just try not to do it again."

"Anything for you, Tenchi-kun."

"Ryoko.I can't.breathe."

"Oops. Guess I don't know my own strength."

**End Flashback**

Ayeka had been watching Ryoko and Tenchi when she glomped 
him. She was just about to go outside and drag her off 
Tenchi when she saw Tenchi's face. Ryoko hadn't noticed, 
but when she hugged him, a smile started tugging at the 
corner of his lips. Ayeka was expecting him to get angry, 
not smile.

It's not fair! She tried to kill him! He should pick me, 
not that pirate! I'm the crown princess of Jurai! Tenchi 
and I were meant to be together!

Ayeka resigned herself to staring out her window into 
space.

***** 
Ooohhh.my head. Ryoko had finally regained consciousness 
and was trying to remember where she was and how she got 
there.

Oh yeah. That Anatio guy took me here. Man, I gotta 
remember to kill him the second I get out of these damn 
ropes. Ryoko then remembered what Anatio's plan was. 
Tenchi, don't fall for it.

*****
"YES!" Washu shouted. "I am definitely the universe's 
greatest scientific genius!"

"A" popped up. "You are the greatest Washu!"

"Go Washu! No one is as smart as you!" "B" said.

"What is it, Washu-chan?" Tenchi asked.

"I've traced the call and found the exact location of 
Anatio's ship. Now you can sneak up on him, get Ryoko, and 
leave without even having to fight."

"That's great! Can you teleport me there?"

"Of course! It's no problem at all for the greatest 
scientific mind in existence!" 

"YAY WASHU!" "A" and "B" both shouted.

"When you want me to teleport you and Ryoko back, just 
contact me with this," she said, tossing Tenchi a wrist 
communicator.

"Got it."

A second later, Tenchi was gone.

***** 
Damn! Tenchi thought. Where the hell can she be? He'd been 
looking around for almost an hour and there was still no 
sign of Ryoko. He only had about half an hour left before 
Anatio would call Washu and realize that he was gone. 

Just as he was about to give up, find Anatio, and force him 
to tell him where Ryoko was, he saw a flash of bright cyan 
that could only be Ryoko's spiky locks. YES! Now all he had 
to do was get her out of there.

Making sure no one was around, he snuck into the small 
room. "Ryoko? Are you 
alright?"

Ryoko looked up at him. "Oh yeah, just peachy. I love being 
tied to this weird bench thingy."

"You know, I could just leave you here," Tenchi said with a 
smirk and started to untie her.

"Tenchi, you're my hero!" She said, glomping him.

"Well, isn't this a lovely little reunion," a low, sinister 
voice said from behind them. They turned around to see 
Anatio leaning against the doorway. "I'm glad you made it, 
Mr. Masaki."

"Anatio!" Tenchi shouted.

"You remembered my name! I'm honored." He pulled out a 
sword that resembled Tenchi-ken and activated it. Tenchi 
took out his own sword, and Ryoko activated her beam saber. 

"Wait," Anatio said calmly, deactivating his sword. "Why 
should I bother getting my hands dirty?" He pulled out a 
device that resembled a remote and pressed the button, then 
stepped back. Seemingly out of nowhere, twenty androinds 
appeared and surrounded Tenchi and Ryoko. "Have fun!"
