DARKNESS & LIGHT - No Need For Kova

By Zyraen

Chapter VIII : No Need for a Trump Card

Washu mentally heaved a sigh of relief as they emerged into Kiyone’s 
apartment. "Kiyone, what’s the meaning of this? Do you know he’s a 
criminal?" She demanded.

Kova’s eyes narrowed as he saw Kiyone flinch, her head bowing. "You are 
in no position to demand anything, professor. Our affairs are none of your 
concern."

"Well, I think…"

"…you should tend to her injuries, in your lab." His voice was icy as he 
stepped over to the wall and rapped sharply on it, conjuring the 
dimensional door. "As for what’s between you and me, we’ll settle it some 
other time. What we need now is a way to destroy those things. Do you have 
the materials to deal with them in your lab?"

Washu’s eyes narrowed. "I don’t trust you going into *my* lab."

"She will be entering, not me." Turning to Kiyone. "Quickly, get your 
hurts tended to, before those cyborgs get back." Looking back at Washu. 
"Teranium?"

"Mmmhmm."

"That will mean getting Morendium to keep them apart, mixed with…"

"Trying to teach your grandmother how to suck eggs, huh?" Washu pointed 
out caustically.

Kova scowled. "Just get on with it."

Washu glared at him and led the somewhat embarrassed Kiyone through the 
door.

===========================================================

"Tenchi Masaki!" He tossed a little in his sleep, wondering what he was 
dreaming of now. He had had a horribly hard time trying to persuade Ryoko 
not to hug him as he lay in his bed, although they were all alone, and 
eventually Aeka got attracted by the commotion, which required even more 
mopping up on his part to prevent a fight. After that he had thought he 
could get some peace and quiet, but now it seemed otherwise. "Tenchi! Mr 
Masaki!" The voice became louder and more urgent, and he thought he could 
feel someone shaking his shoulders.

"Wha.." he asked, yawning. "What is it?" His vision cleared and he saw 
who was by his bedside. "You!" He exclaimed, surprise driving him wide 
awake in an instant. "What are you doing here!?" Even in the dark, he 
could make out the battered state of the person before him. "What the…?"

"We’re in danger." Kova spoke tersely, as though giving commands under 
extreme duress. "Get the rest of them up. Keep together and don’t let any 
of them out of your sight." He paused again. "If you see anyone, get him 
or her to make up a sentence on the spot. If they sound unlike their usual 
selves, prepare to attack or be attacked."

Tenchi stared at him, eyes still wide open.

This simply has to be a dream.

"What are you doing!?" Kova growled at him. "They might be here any 
minute! Get moving and get your people together!" He glanced at Tenchi, 
noting the absence of any weapon on him. "I don’t know how you beat 
Kagato, but whatever you used, you’d better get that weapon out now."

"Wha…?"

The spy’s eye narrowed as he saw Tenchi still a little shell shocked. 
Mentally cursing the fool for his slow reaction, he clasped his rod, and 
Tenchi’s eyes opened with fear as a shining blue laser scythe appeared in 
the hands of the grim faced stranger before him, gleaming coldly in the 
darkness. A cold sneer on his face, the ex-pirate swung and Tenchi 
reflexively ducked away under the scythe’s deadly sweep and rolled off his 
bed.

Where did I put that sword? He asked himself frantically.

Kova stepped before him around the bed, and swung again. Tenchi threw 
himself backwards, and the scythe’s edge just missed his nose by a hair’s 
breadth. Almost instinctively, his right hand opened a drawer and his 
fingers closed around something inside. Grinning evilly at having cornered 
Tenchi, Kova sent the scythe arcing in again from the left, so Tenchi 
would be trapped between the scythe and the wall.

Another beam of blue illuminated the darkness between the sweep of the 
scythe and Tenchi’s body, as the boy steeled himself for the strike and 
the combat that was to come, but the scythe did not strike his sword. Kova 
grinned, with his scythe stopping barely a centimetre from Tenchi’s 
sword’s edge.

"Well, you have found your weapon, descendant of Jurai." The energy 
scythe disappeared, leaving only the silver rod in his hand. "Find the 
rest, especially Aeka and Sasami. Kiyone and Washu are in the lab, so 
forget them. And if you lose that sword of yours, I’ll be back for you." 
Tenchi managed to make out a cold and emotionlessly set face before the 
stranger vanished out the door of him room. He shivered, despite the light 
from his sword.

That felt like a visit from death.

===========================================================

"Is the formula ready?" the door opened slightly. Washu glanced back to 
make sure he wasn’t in the lab. Kiyone, who was beside her, frowned.

"Washu, if Kova says he isn’t going to come in, he isn’t going to."

Washu looked up at the detective. She was looking much better, thanks to 
Washu. "And what do you know about him, Kiyone? In case you forgot, he was 
a spy." She gave Kiyone a strange look. "Is it possible that the Kiyone I 
know can be ruled by her heart rather than mind?"

Kiyone turned away, feeling a little slighted. Washu peered at the time 
scale on her computer. "Give me three more minutes, Kashiro."

"Very well, professor. Are you feeling better, Kiyone-chan?"

"Thank you, Kova-chan. I’m feeling much better now." Kiyone sounded very 
pleased, and Washu shook her head in disgust as she heard them calling 
each other that way. The door closed and she returned to tending to 
Kiyone.

"You know, you’re just preparing yourself for a lot of heartache, 
Kiyone." She mentioned offhandedly as she rubbed some powder onto Kiyone’s 
burnt back.

Kiyone sighed. "I know it will hurt me, Washu. But sometimes you just 
have to go through fire and blood to get what you really want."

"You don’t really want a spy cum space pirate, do you?" Washu’s eyes were 
cold and her expression skeptical. "You’re a Galaxy Police Officer. The 
two of you just don’t belong together."

The green eyes filled with pain, and doubt. "Washu, I believe that some 
how, we can make it together. Leave it to me, okay? I’ll manage." She 
smiled a little. "We’ll manage."

"Well, I don’t trust him."

"Not even after he saved you?" Kiyone shook her head. "Washu, you’re too 
fixated on Science."

"And you, Kiyone, are too fixated on him." Washu casually pressed several 
buttons, and Kiyone blinked as she saw a file appear before her. The 
picture was of Kova, all right, but a very young Kova, who looked like he 
was only about Tenchi’s age. Two scars marred his face, one across his 
forehead, another down his left cheek, while his blue eyes seemed cold and 
calculating. Washu tapped another key, and the strings of incomprehensible 
sigils changed into rational words, and read as follows.

"So, how do you like what you see?" Washu, half smirking, turned, and was 
utterly flabbergasted to see Kiyone smiling serenely to herself.

He didn’t lie to me.

"Hey, Kiyone, what’s wrong with you?" Washu wrinkled her brow, irritated.

"Oh nothing." Kiyone smiled knowingly. "Nothing at all."

===========================================================

"Is everyone here?" Tenchi asked, casting his eye around. Mihoshi, Ryoko, 
Aeka, Sasami, with Ryo-oh-ki on her head, stared back at him, half in 
curiosity, half in fear, at the shining sword in his hand.

"Say, what is going on, Tenchi?" Ryoko asked. "Is this some kind of 
game?"

"No, Ryoko." Tenchi looked at five pairs of eyes staring curiously at 
him, and gulped. "Not at one o’clock in the morning. Someone told me to 
make sure you all were safe." His brown eyes dilated at the thought. "And 
he nearly killed me." His hand gripped Tenchi-ken harder.

"Who is he?" Aeka asked, running one hand over Anako’s soft fur. The 
kitten purred as she stroked its tummy.

"I have no idea. All I know is, he was the one Sasami and I saw at 
Kiyone’s side last night."

Sasami’s eyes widened. "What was he doing here?"

"No idea. Mihoshi, would you know anything about anyone Kiyone knows?"

"Erm, well, there was this rather tall chap with whom she was…" Mihoshi’s 
face reddened.

"Who was he?" Ryoko pressed, sounding annoyed.

"Huh? Oh, I didn’t see his face." Mihoshi looked around. "Tenchi, where 
is Kiyone?"

"The someone who got us up told me she’s in the lab with Washu."

"Oh." Mihoshi turned and made for the door. Tenchi, his expression 
worried, quickly lunged forward and grabbed her wrist, taking care not to 
cut anyone with his sword.

"You’re not going out." He told her. It was a statement, a command. "He’s 
out there. And he’s got a really *big* scythe." His voice trembled at the 
memory.

"Don’t worry, Tenchi!" Mihoshi laughed. "If he’s Kiyone’s friend, he’ll 
be nice to me." She shook her hand, but Tenchi’s grip remained firm. "Let 
go of me, Tenchi!"

"No, Mihoshi."

Say, this was strange, he thought. Why the hell am I taking the word of a 
stranger so seriously?

His appearance. The way he wore his wounds like they were nothing, and 
the way his cold and impassive face looked dead serious at him.

Tenchi, still holding on to Mihoshi, stared at his sword.

Why did he force me to draw it?

"Tenchi…" Sasami tugged at his elbow.

He recalled how they had all sat up and stared the moment they saw him 
and his gleaming blade. Without it, there was no way he could have got 
them all up and alert so quickly.

"Tenchi…"

"Yes, Sasami?" He let go of Mihoshi, who had given up struggling in 
favour of enjoying the feel of his hand holding her wrist.

"Where’s your father?"

===========================================================

"What the…?" Kova stared as he saw Tenchi all by himself, trying to get 
Nobuyuki off the couch in the living room, with *no* sword in his hand. 
"Tenchi?"

The boy turned to look at him blankly, not speaking. Kova tensed, then 
Tenchi suddenly picked Nobuyuki off the couch without any effort, hefted 
him on his shoulder and made for the door.

That man must be Tenchi’s father!

The scythe flashed into existence and arced through the darkness, only to 
strike against a scarlet laser sword.

"Huh?" Nobuyuki awoke, his world a blur from not having his specs. "Hey, 
what’s going on?"

Kova leaped back as Ryoko appeared out of thin air at Tenchi’s side.

"Tenchi?" He heard her say, confused, yellow eyes going to the scarlet 
blade.

"Get him, Ryoko!" Kova cried. "We must get that man back!"

Ryoko paused in indecision. "Who are you?" She asked Kova.

The main door to the outside slid open behind them, with Aeka framed in 
the doorway. Tenchi quickly parried another stroke from Kova, and Ryoko’s 
eyes widened as he effortlessly threw Nobuyuki to Aeka, who caught him in 
her arms and turned to go.

"Wow, I’m being carried by the princess of Jurai!" Nobuyuki sighed in 
bliss, staring at the purple cloth before him. "This must be a dream!"

"Stop it, Ryoko!" Kova lunged back, his scythe swinging in an arc, as 
Tenchi, his face grim and set in determination, planted himself between 
Kova and the Aeka behind him. "I mean her, Aeka!" The blue arc suddenly 
twisted and its path shifted slightly inwards, and swifter than thought, 
Kova’s blade scraped the edge of the crimson sword, bypassing the parry.

"NOO!" Ryoko screamed as the azure scythe sliced neatly into Tenchi’s 
right shoulder blade and out under his left arm. As though in a nightmare, 
she saw Tenchi topple back, his body splitting bloodlessly into two.

Her heart stopped, and died.

Still stunned from shock, she stared as Kova leaped past the body and 
towards the closed door. "COME BACK HERE!!!" She screamed, tears flowing 
out of her eyes, as orange sparks gathered in the air around her.

Kova just managed to turn around.

Aeka stopped to watch, a thin smile on the face, as the spy smashed 
through the door, hands gripping his weapon tightly, his blue shield laser 
shield on his forearms protecting him from the immense orange plasma beam 
that hurled him out past Aeka and Nobuyuki.

"Ryoko!?" The space pirate heard Aeka ask from behind her.

"He killed Tenchi." She growled softly, tears blurring her vision, then 
she was speeding out after Kova, a primal force of vengeance.

"Did I hear that right?" Mihoshi asked, staring at Tenchi beside her, who 
shrugged.

"What is that!?" Sasami asked, pointing at the metallic humanoid thing 
that lay between them and the door. Even as they watched, the last bit of 
it joined up seamlessly, like liquid flowing together.

"Destroy that thing!" Kiyone called as she emerged from the lab, her 
instincts telling her what it was they were staring at, as Washu appeared 
behind her.

Before five astonished pair of eyes, the shape got up and was out the 
door.

===========================================================

"Ryoko, STOP!" Kova cried out, in vain. "Please!" His scythe spun like a 
staff in his hands, deflecting yet another volley of orange plasma beams. 
Snarling, Ryoko was deaf to his pleas, her face a sight of savagery intent 
on avenging her supposedly fallen beloved. Kova spun around as the pirate 
appeared behind him, laser sword slashing out in a frenzied barrage, and 
his scythe was a mere blur of light as he defended himself.

Aeka smiled as the silver being sped towards her and transformed into 
Katsuhito.

Kiyone burst out of the house under the night sky, followed by Washu and 
the rest.

"Kova-chan!" Kiyone cried out.

"Ryoko, please!" The spy begged, one forearm fending off a laser sword, 
as his other hand parried another, for Ryoko had split into two. "Save my 
father!" He cried, using Tenchi’s voice.

Ryoko stopped, not believing her ears, and her orange blade 
dematerialised as her hand was halfway down. Kova quickly stepped back and 
leaped towards the false Aeka and Katsuhito, spinning around in mid-air to 
attack the cyborg holding Nobuyuki. Aeka tossed a little red ball of 
energy at Kova, and the explosion sent him flying right back, but he 
landed on his feet, scythe upright and ready.

"What’s going on?" Mihoshi, Sasami, Tenchi and Aeka all asked at the same 
time. Kiyone did not bother to explain, but charged forward, firing salvos 
at Katsuhito, whose hand was turning red as he prepared to blast Kova.

"We have to get your father back, before they can react and use him as a 
hostage."

"My father? What about grandpa?" Tenchi asked, watching as Kiyone’s 
golden blasts struck Katsuhito on the head, shoulder and legs.

"He’s not your grandpa." Washu said wryly as the four of them, eyes 
bulging, watched the holes in Katsuhito’s body mend back together. Kiyone 
dived to one side and jumped, as the red laser beams trailed her path of 
flight, just skimming over her flesh.

Kova, his face set in a shape of grim determination, hurled his scythe in 
an arc high up into the sky, where it vanished, and ran at the Aeka 
cyborg. Sasami watched open mouthed, as the spy somersaulted over the 
crimson energy balls that flew at him, even as Tenchi, Mihoshi and Aeka 
joined the fray.

Kiyone saw Mihoshi and Aeka coming in to assist her, and her enemy’s 
attention was momentarily diverted. Seizing her chance, she tossed her yo-
yo in a curve towards Katsuhito. Aeka jumped before Mihoshi, letting her 
blue force field absorb the energy blasts, as Kiyone’s yo-yo wrapped 
around the robot. The green haired detective jerked hard, as the her left 
hand levelled Kova’s blaster at the cyborg, but to her amazement, her 
foe’s form just yielded and the parts of it that her yo-yo that were in 
contact with melted away, so that it was as though she had caught nothing 
but air. Frustrated, she unleashed several shots, as the yo-yo spun back 
into her hand, but the enemy just grinned as the yellow blasts tore 
through him with little effect.

The Aeka cyborg, still gripping the by now totally horrified Nobuyuki 
with one hand, watched as Kova landed before her and Tenchi, sword blazing 
away, charged in from the side. Ryoko, having realised her beloved Tenchi 
was still alive, had been galvanised into action and was flying in, orange 
power crackling about her hands, but she dared not fire with Nobuyuki so 
close by. Kova lunged in, using the edge of his laser shield as though his 
forearms were blades, but a scarlet energy whip materialised in the 
things’ free hand, lashed at his form, and he was forced to raise an arm 
in defence, as the cyborg side stepped the other lunge. Tenchi’s sword 
sliced through the air from the side of the cyborg, but grinning slightly, 
the false Aeka brought Nobuyuki in his way, and his sword halted in mid 
air, just an inch from his father’s forehead. Cursing in anger, Tenchi 
parried as the whip lashed out at him, watching as Kova sliced half of the 
fake Aeka’s throat with his laser shield, only to see it mend back. The 
purple eyes widened as Ryoko shot in, orange sword in one hand, an 
incandescent wreath of force in her other hand.

I cannot hold, the creature thought.

The Aeka quickly tossed her whip down on the ground as Ryoko drew near.

"Watch out!" Kova cried, forearms up, as the thing exploded into a 
crimson eruption.

Oh no, Tenchi thought as his vision lighted up.

"Tenchi!" Ryoko just managed to seize him and the two vanished away as 
the blast smashed into where they had just occupied.

Kiyone watched, stunned with fear, as Kova sailed through the air. He 
somehow still landed on his feet, his teeth gritting against each other, 
but as he made to move forward, he collapsed to his knees.

The false Aeka landed safely back on the ground, holding her miraculously 
unscathed hostage, smiling in amusement as Kova bowed before her. She 
watched as everyone turned towards at her, ignoring the Katsuhito cyborg. 
Mihoshi and Kiyone aimed their three blasters at her, Washu raised a hand, 
Aeka prepared to charge with her blue forcefield.

"One wrong move, and he dies." One white hand went around Nobuyuki’s 
throat and everyone froze before the metallic, soulless voice’s 
pronouncement, as the other cyborg relaxed.

Kova, tilting his head slightly up, grinned.

A blue streak descended from the night sky, faster than thought. The 
cyborg’s eyes widened in shock as the scythe, falling like a shooting 
star, split the robot down the middle and into two, before streaking 
towards Kova. The hand holding Nobuyuki’s throat loosened, and Tenchi and 
the Katsuhito cyborg simultaneously raced to Nobuyuki. The cyborg’s hand 
closed around Nobuyuki waist, as Tenchi, shouting in a rage, lashed out. 
Green sparks flashed out as azure struck scarlet, then a rapid succession 
of blasts forced Tenchi to parry the lasers, as the false Katsuhito leaped 
up and made off towards the shrine.

"Get my father back!" Tenchi shouted, and Ryoko and Aeka quickly 
complied. The Katsuhito dodged an orange beam, and Azaka and Kamadake (the 
logs) appeared beside him. The guardians hesitated for a moment, seeing 
Tenchi’s grandfather and father was between them, and the cyborg quickly 
struck Kamadake down with slash, and leaped over the fallen log into the 
forest by the side of the stairs leading to the Masaki shrine.

Kova stood up, seeming to have fed off the energy that his scythe 
provided, as the scythe faded back into a silver rod. Watching the spot 
where the enemy made off, he sprinted after the thing.

"I’ll go after them, you take care of Tenchi." Ryoko flashed out of 
existence as Aeka hesitated.

Behind them, Washu quickly stepped towards the fallen android that was 
rapidly joining back together, her hand holding a chemical spray.

"Washu!" Sasami screamed. Several salvos of crimson streamed from forest 
at Washu. Cursing, Washu’s shield materialised, her angry eyes watching in 
muted frustration through the flashes on her shield as the cyborg formed 
up before her.

Washu swore vehemently as the silvery cyborg got up and gave her a 
cheerful grin, before moving out after the other one. Mihoshi and Kiyone 
blasted it, but it quickly sent a crimson ball of energy in their 
direction, and the two officers jumped out of the way of the blast, giving 
it a chance to make good its escape.

===========================================================

The Katsuhito cyborg’s blasts stopped as Ryoko materialised beside him. 
The space pirate flew on him in a rage, but the robot calmly parried her 
blow. Ryoko feinted and stabbed, forgetting the robots were impervious to 
such attacks, and watched as her sword struck through the thing’s chest. 
Fortunately, she managed to teleport away before her own arm got lopped 
off - that certainly wasn’t as dispensable as the robot’s.

"Damn, what will it take to bring this thing down!?" Ryoko pondered as an 
orange glow lit up her hand. Katsuhito smiled a sagely smile, and brought 
Nobuyuki up before him, before bounding away as Ryoko hesitated. "Don’t 
you dare get away!" She ground her teeth and prepared to give chase, but a 
continual barrage of scarlet beams forced her to duck and weave among the 
trees. Kova ran past her, his forearms deflecting the beams from him, as 
he vanished into the trees, and the laser blasts stopped rather abruptly, 
leaving the night cold and blue again.

===========================================================

Katsuhito, or Yosho, took slow, even steps, his eyes searching carefully 
among the trees. He had been aroused from his usually restful evening by 
sounds of explosions and fighting from the house below, and was rather 
curious as to the red laser beams that had shot into the sky. Trusting to 
his instincts that it was no laughing matter, he had taken up his bokken 
and gone for a walk.

He raised his eyebrow as he saw a running figure. It was a rather young 
man, about twenty five at most, with blue hair and dressed in ragged blue 
pants and jacket. On his shoulders he recognised his son-in-law. Katsuhito 
shook his head.

Young people nowadays, so delinquent. Imagine catching someone as hentai 
as Nobuyuki. Not to mention arousing everyone in the process, and making a 
mess of an otherwise peaceful evening.

Kova spun around, Nobuyuki on his shoulders. His chill blue eyes 
attempted to pierce the trees and the shadows they cast on the ground, but 
he saw no one.

Katsuhito shook his head.

Quite a handsome chap. Too bad he’s on the wrong side of the law.

Kova prepared to run. He could hear sounds of pursuit, but they might not 
find him yet. It was because something told him there was a strong foe, 
nearby.

Katsuhito stepped out from behind a tree.

"Excuse me, young man, could you return me my son-in-law?"

Kova turned around slowly, the fear showing plain on his face, but it was 
not pale. His blue eyes gleamed in the dark like stones, as he regarded 
the frail old man behind him, who was looking calmly at him with a vague 
smile on his face.

"My son-in-law, please?" Katsuhito yawned a little as he leaned on a 
tree, his bokken flicking idly up and down in the air. Kova stared at him, 
wide eyed.

I can’t run away.

Kova slowly took Nobuyuki off his shoulder and presented him with both 
hands to Katsuhito. The former prince extended both his arms, leaving his 
bokken by the tree, to receive him like a prize.

Two stabs of red lasers shot from the hands under Nobuyuki towards 
Katsuhito.

Katsuhito gently caught Nobuyuki, and stepped away.

That’s funny, Kova thought to himself as he saw his red laser sword 
flicker out of existence. I could have sworn I blocked his bokken.

His eyes still staring in shock, Kova gently toppled down, split into two 
at the waist. The tree which Katsuhito had leaned on creaked a little, for 
its trunk had two gaping holes, and landed on top of Kova with a rustling 
crash.

Katsuhito shook his head, and stared at the bokken handle in his hand. He 
looked at a tree about two metres beside him, where its wooden blade of 
the bokken had cut almost halfway into.

Young people nowadays. Thinking their new fangled weapons could help 
them. All that did was make me lose a bokken.

Shaking his head at how heavy the unconscious Nobuyuki was, he made for 
his shrine.

===========================================================

"Stick together and stay here." Kiyone told Mihoshi, Sasami, Tenchi and 
Aeka. "Don’t let them split us up."

"My father’s up there!" Tenchi almost shouted at her.

"Relax, Kova and Ryoko can get him back." Kiyone told him. "Who knows 
what confusion they might wreak there in the forest?"

The image of Ryoko and Kova battling earlier returned to Tenchi’s mind.

"They’ll come back anyway." Washu commented.

"Why would they?" Tenchi asked, his face skeptical. "They’ve got my dad."

"Who would want him?" Washu asked, letting out her irritation by 
squeezing her chemical spray hard. Not that it would break, it was made 
out of elastic material. "Other than you, I mean?"

"Then what do they want?" Aeka asked, unsure whether or not.

Washu just lightly tapped her own chest.

"You?" Mihoshi asked.

Washu face-faulted. "No! Not me, Mihoshi! The Tachyon Blaster!"

There was silence.

"I hope they’re all right." Sasami murmured.

===========================================================

Katsuhito arched an eyebrow as he heard movement in the plants around 
him, but otherwise he remained totally unaffected.

The person watching him from the trees blinked in puzzlement.

Why is the cyborg holding Tenchi's father with both hands, looking so calm,
and strolling along as though he were taking a walk in the park?

Uncertainty took hold of him. Perhaps, he would have to make sure first…

A silver blur arced out of the trees.

Katsuhito, not looking up, caught it, and tossed it back, as it seethed 
with electricity upon being held by someone other than its owner. Supple 
fingers snatched it out the air as Kova stepped into the sight.

"Surrender him, old man." The spy ordered.

Katsuhito shook his head slowly. "You again? One would think you’d 
learn." He gently set his son-in-law down.

Pity my bokken’s broken, he thought.

Kova hesitated at his gentle actions, and Katsuhito peered at him 
curiously.

"If there’s nothing I can do for you, I’ll be wishing you a good night."

Kova stopped, puzzled. This person was clearly not a cyborg, but if he 
was aiding them, he could not afford to let him go. Better safe than 
sorry.

Katsuhito saw a blur before him, and quickly sidestepped.

Not bad, he’s learnt to move much faster now. Pretty great improvement in 
such a short time.

Kova opened his mouth in shock as he tripped over Katsuhito’s foot. 
Rolling as he fell, he just managed to scoop up Nobuyuki, and stand on his 
feet. Katsuhito watched, half amused at the shining scythe Kova held 
menacingly between him and Katsuhito. "Stay back, old man!" He warned.

"My, that’s a very nice scythe you got there!" He smiled genially. 
"Reminds me of my sword…"

Kova fell back, his jaw smarting. His solar plexus, jaw, forearms, chest 
and knee caps had all been struck at, but he had managed to avoid or block 
them all, except the second strike. He held his scythe up again, his hand 
a little unsteady, as he carried Nobuyuki in the other.

"Impressive." Katsuhito nodded his approval, for the edges of both his 
sleeves had been cut off by the scythe’s deadly sweep. "Maybe I’ll train 
you like I teach my grandson." He rolled back his sleeves…

Sensing danger, the old man ducked and rolled away as three orange plasma 
beams shot from behind over where he had been standing. Kova quickly 
raised his free forearm, and his scythe, deflecting the three blasts, as 
Ryoko flew in, her face a grim mask of anger, her orange laser sword in 
hand.

She looked at Kova, surprised that he was still alive. "Whoever you are, 
bring Tenchi’s father back. As for you…" Her hands seethed with energy as 
she stared at Katsuhito, teeth bared.

What a very strange evening, Katsuhito thought to himself, as he 
effortlessly darted in and out between Ryoko’s laser beams, trying to 
keep in sight of his son-in-law and the young abductor who was bounding 
away.

===========================================================

Kova walked out of the base of the forest, holding Nobuyuki in his arms.

"Well done, Kova-chan," Kiyone smiled as he emerged from the shadows.

He gave a cold smirk, then a scarlet laser sword was held before 
Nobuyuki’s throat.

"Kova-chan?" Kiyone eyes dilated, her voice going cold, as Tenchi, his 
anger showing plainly on his face, stopped the advancing Aeka.

Mihoshi looked at Kova curiously, "What’s going on?"

"Give me the Tachyon Blaster," the metallic voice announced.

Washu’s eyes narrowed, her hand squeezing the chemical spray hard. "Not 
in…" Someone lay a hand on her shoulder and her pink eyes met Tenchi’s. 
Anger and rage burned within the brown eyes, but at the same time they 
pleaded and begged with her.

"Please, Washu…" his voice was low, serious, and beseeching.

Washu turned from him and stared at the smirking cyborg, her eyes blazing 
in anger. "All right, you bastard, you win." Slowly she removed the 
Tachyon Blaster from within the folds of her dress and took a reluctant 
step towards the thing. Kova drew back a step, his sword pressing closer 
to Nobuyuki.

"I don’t trust you," he stared at Washu, then at Sasami. "You, little 
girl, bring it to me!"

"Don’t listen, Sasami!" Aeka ordered.

"Do it or he dies!"

Sasami looked hesitantly at Washu, then Tenchi.

"Sasami, I’m sorry." Tenchi shook his head, his sword hanging down limply 
by his side.

The little princess remained silent. Looking at Washu, she gingerly 
reached out a hand. Sighing in defeat, Washu passed the Blaster to Sasami. 
The princess moved over, as the Kova cyborg slowly brought Nobuyuki up 
onto his shoulder, his sword still taking care to hover near his throat, 
so he had the other hand free.

===========================================================

In the meantime, Kova, still fleeing from the old man that pursued him, 
apparently unhampered by Ryoko’s blasts, pieced together some things.

‘You again?’ ‘…my sword…’ ‘…teach my grandson…’

It all fitted in so well…

"You’re Yosho!" He cried, spinning around.

"So?" Katsuhito deftly somersaulted, half twisted, and ducked another 
series of Ryoko’s blasts.

"Ryoko! Stop it! He’s Tenchi’s grandfather!" Ryoko’s eyes widened in 
surprise as she took in Kova’s pronouncement. "I’m sorry, great one!" He 
hastily put Nobuyuki on the ground. "Take care of him, please! And sorry!" 
They were already almost on the level of shrine.

"What’s going on!?" Ryoko alighted, staring at Katsuhito. Katsuhito 
ignored her and picked Nobuyuki up, walking back to the shrine. She 
mentally slapped herself on the forehead.

I should have known. It’s just like Yosho to act so unworried.

===========================================================

Sasami went over, and placed the weapon in his outstretched and open 
hand. The creature raised the gun, triumphantly.

"Let’s test this thing." He smiled evilly, his finger holding the 
trigger, as Sasami’s eyes widened in fear. Washu tried, and managed to, 
stop herself from grinning - her Stasis Discharger was ready for any such 
attempt. Instead however, the hand pulsed red for a moment, and then he 
grinned. "Object analysis complete. Purpose, to emit Tachyon stream 
capable of mass destruction, with adjustable setting."

"My father…?" Tenchi asked, worried.

"Oh yes, this human. We have no use for him, I’m afraid." He set Nobuyuki 
down, one hand holding the blaster, the other still keeping his sword 
point close to his throat. "So you may have him back." Tenchi’s eyes 
brightened hopefully. "His body, I mean." Grinning, the cyborg thrust his 
blade into Nobuyuki’s throat.

"DAD!" Tenchi screamed, his voice the utter embodiment of horror and 
loss. Laughing maniacally, Kova kicked the body over to Tenchi, and back 
flipped away.

Yellow lasers and pink blasts split the air as Kiyone, Mihoshi and Washu 
attacked while Aeka charged at the murderer. The scarlet laser sword 
lashed out, knocking the tiny guardians out of the air, and laser blasts 
shot back at Aeka’s shield.

"Dad…" Tenchi whispered brokenly, cradling Nobuyuki, with a gaping red 
hole in his throat. Sasami, her eyes tearful, knelt by him, trying not to 
see the dead body.

"Tenchi, I…" Her eyes widened in fear as Nobuyuki’s eyes sprang open.

Tenchi felt a vicious kick in his stomach and he sailed back into the 
air, as Nobuyuki grabbed the stunned Sasami around the waist. The princess 
gasped in fear as before her astonished face Nobuyuki’s throat mended 
back.

"YOU!" Tenchi shouted in anger and shock as he got up, stomach hurting, 
and Washu, Mihoshi and Kiyone turned around, but not attacking for fear of 
striking Sasami.

"Farewell, humans." The robot smirked. "Stellar, Solar, take us up!" 
Kiyone, Mihoshi and Washu watched helpless, as a silver light from the 
heavens enveloped Nobuyuki and the struggling Sasami under his arms.

Aeka opened her eyes in shock as a beam of white descended from the night 
sky and sucked the Kova cyborg upwards in mid leap, so that she just 
skimmed by under. The thing grinned at her as her blue force field just 
missed it, and vanished skywards.
