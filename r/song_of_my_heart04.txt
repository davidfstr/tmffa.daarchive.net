A/N - I'd like to thank Rini, for chopping up the tree that was blocking my 
train of thought. Thanks Rini! Lots of hugs for you! so now we'll get on with 
part 4!

Song of My Heart: Betrayal

Hotsuma didn't know what to do, so he went with it, and kissed back, after all 
he had wanted to do this before.
Ryoko's eyes shot open and she broke the kiss.
"Oh my god.. what have i done...." she said somewhat breathlessly.
"You kissed me...." said Hotsuma, he had hoped it was ment to be, but her new 
reaction shattered that thought.
"Oh my God.. I've betrayed tenchi....." she cried as her eyes started to tear 
up.
Hotsuma sighed. {That was what I wanted for so long in space...} he thought.
"I.. I hafta go.... sorry, bye!" she said quickly then teleported back to the 
house.
Hotsuma sighed sadly and teleported back.

"What have I done?!?!" Ryoko cried as she reapeared back in the lab where Yugi 
and Washu waited.
"I dunno what did you do?" said Washu abnoxiosly.
"Yea tell us!" said Yugi exitedly.
"I.... I kissed him! oh God I betrayed Tenchi!!" Ryoko sobbed.
"You kissed him? But you love him, so how did you betray Tenchi?!?!" Yugi said.
"I donno!" Ryoko cried frustrated, she ran out of the lab and to her room.

"Hey Ryo.. whats with her?" said Tenchi as Ryoko ran past him and up the stairs. 
"Oh well..."

When Ryoko reached her room, she teleported to the roof where Hotsuma also was, 
but she didnt notice him so she proceeded to sob.
Hotsuma noticed Ryoko and quietly walked up behind her, putting his hand gently 
on her shoulder. "Was I really all that bad?" he said, in a voice that was 
almost a whisper.
"Ah!" Ryoko screamed and jumped a foot in the air, when she heard Hotsuma. "Oh.. 
it's just you... heh..." she blushed from embarassment. "Hotsuma I..."
"Ryoko...." They spoke at the same time. "I love you...." they completed at the 
same time.
"But then why do you feel that you betrayed Tenchi?" He asked.
"I.. I still love him somewhere in my heart.... but then I think of you.... and 
it's like two voices trying to sing over eachother....." she replyed sadly.
