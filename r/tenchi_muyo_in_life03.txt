TENCHI MUYO IN LIFE Part III


Henrii goes with Tenchi to the Masaski Shine and did a practice battle with 
Yosho. The next day things gets hotter.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DISCALMER:  I do not own all the characters like Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, 
Mihoshi, and so on in this fanfic, or anything that is own by AIC and 
Pioneer.  Well except for Commander Henrii Lok.  I do not want a lawsuit 
because I just can’t afford to pay that much money.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NO NEED FOR A BATTLE
Up in the Masaki Shine where Yosho was.  Tenchi opened the door to the 
shine.  Henrii peeks a look to see what’s inside the shine.
“Where did my grandpa go this time?” said Tenchi.  All of a sudden Yosho 
attacked Tenchi from the top and hit Tenchi in the head and in the stomach 
with a wooden stick.
“When you look for an enemy don’t just look straight ahead or your left and 
right look all over the place to find where your enemy is,” said Yosho 
picking up his wooden sword.
“Ok grandpa,” said Tenchi in pain.
“Get your sword or you will be spanked by my sword!” said Yosho as Tenchi 
reach over to a wall with wooden swords.  They fought for 30 minutes because 
Tenchi was tripped by Yosho and lost his sword.
“Well you are doing better,  you still need more practice and more practice 
and even more practice,” said Yosho.
“Ok grandpa,” said Tenchi in more pain.
“Ah Henrii nice to see you again,” said Yosho.
“Same here,” said Henrii.
“You and me do a battle now!” said Yosho as he rushed at Henrii.
“Here Henrii catch!” said Tenchi as he threw his sword to Henrii.  Henrii 
caught the sword and jump into the air.  And landed behind Yosho’s back.
“That was good Henrii,” said Yosho.
“Ahhhhh!” cried out Henrii as Yosho and Henrii attacked each other.  Tenchi 
stood there treating his pain and watched Henrii and Yosho fight and fight 
and fight some more.  Tenchi thought man what time is it.  I felt like it 
had been hours when they started to fight.  Tenchi yelled to Henrii.
“What time is it Henrii?” said Tenchi.
“It is 8:42 right now!” said Henrii
“I’m going home to eat dinner,” said Tenchi
“Yeah that a good idea,” said Henrii.
“I’m starving too,” said Yosho.  Henrii took a good swing at Yosho’s sword 
that made him move backwards.  Henrii started to run back to the Masaki 
house.  Yosho quickly followed him.
“Where is Tenchi and Henrii?” said Sasami.
“Where is Lord Tenchi and Commander Henrii?” asked Ayeka.
“I don’t know, because dinner is getting cold,” said Sasami.
“Hey look here comes Henrii, Yosho, and Tenchi!” said Mihoshi as she looked 
through the window.  Washu opens the door and see that Yosho and Henrii were 
fighting and Tenchi was running to the house.
“Watch out guys Henrii and grandpa are going to eat dinner while fighting,” 
said Tenchi.  Henrii and Yosho went inside the house and entered the dinning 
room where all the girls were.  Henrii and Yosho saw the food on the table 
and they really wanted to stop and eat but they must fight till one loses.  
Henrii kicked the table and all the food went into the air and Henrii grab a 
bowl of soup and drank it in one gulp and threw the bowl into the sink.  
Yosho grabbed a plate of fish and swallowed it whole and spit out the bones 
in the trash can and toss the plate into the sink.  All the food landed back 
into the table without spilling.  Henrii jumped over the table and grab for 
the sashimi and a bowl of rice and flipped to the end of the dinning room 
and put all the rice and sashimi in his mouth and tossed the rice bowl into 
the sink and started to chew.  Yosho was rushed at him and Henrii jumps over 
Yosho and took a glass of water and drank it.  Henrii attacked at Yosho and 
Yosho moved fast enough to dodge Henrii attack and grab the sake.  Yosho 
drank all the sake and threw it to the sink and ran outside.  Henrii 
followed Yosho outside to continue to fight.
“Whoa that was cool,” said Tenchi.
“Yeah,” said the girls.
“Where is Ryo-Ohki?” asked Sasami.
“She is in the storage room,” said Washu.
“Ok,” said Sasami as she went to the storage room and found a fat cabbit.
“Miya,” said Ryo-Ohki
“You are so silly Ryo-Ohki,” said Sasami as she picked up Ryo-Ohki into her 
arms.  At 11:00 Tenchi couldn’t sleep because he could hear Yosho and Henrii 
fighting around the house.  All of a sudden there was complete silence and a 
loud splash.  Tenchi got up and looked outside.
“Its finally over,” said Tenchi.  Tenchi left his room and Ayeka, Ryoko, and 
Sasami followed him.
“What’s going on Tenchi dear?” said Ryoko holding his arm.
“Grandpa beat Henrii,” said Tenchi as he opened the door.  They ran up to 
Yosho and saw that Henrii was in the lake.
“What was the longest battle I was ever in,” said a drenched Henrii.
“Same here.  You are very well skilled Henrii, you should teach Tenchi 
something,” said Yosho as he headed to the shine.
“Wow Henrii you are pretty good in sword fighting!” said Sasami.
“Yeah,” said Henrii as he got out of the water.  He punched some buttons on 
his watch and changed into drier clothes.  And headed back inside the house 
with Sasami.
“Tenchi dear, you would fight like that for me right?” said Ryoko.
“He would never fight for you, but for me!” said Ayeka.
“Oh yeah!” said Ryoko.
“Yeah!’ said Ayeka.  They started to argue and Tenchi and Sasami went back 
inside the house.
“Why you foul beast!” cried out Ayeka.
“You would never get Tenchi even you show your inflated body to him!” said 
Ryoko as a loud boom was heard over the dark night skies.

NO NEED FOR EXPERIMENTS
“What a beautiful morning,” said Azaka.
“I agree,” sighed Kamidake with relief.  All of a sudden a loud scream was 
heard.  Azaka and Kamidake had big sweat drops from the top of their 
woodenheads.
“GET OFF FROM LORD TENCHI’S BED THIS INSTANT!” screamed Ayeka.
“IF YOU HAVEN’T KNOWN, ME AND TENCHI MADE LOVE FOR REAL!  RIGHT HONEY!” 
screamed a half-naked Ryoko.
“Umm err hmm,” said Tenchi as he looked under his blanket and saw himself 
half naked.  I couldn’t have, I don’t even remember a thing Tenchi thought.  
Henrii woke up and saw Ryoko and Ayeka was near his futon and he sat up and 
watched the fight.
“Commander did Tenchi made love with Ryoko?” asked Ayeka softly.
“I don’t know, I feel asleep like a rock,” said Henrii scratching his head.
“Lord Tenchi did you made…love to that monster?” said Ayeka.
“Don’t call her that Ayeka, and I don’t know, really,” said Tenchi.
“Oh Lord Tenchi!” as she ran out of Tenchi’s room crying.
“I got it Tenchi,” said Henrii as he got up and followed Ayeka.
“Since we are alone Tenchi,” said Ryoko with an evil smile.
“Err Ryoko you shouldn’t make Ayeka very upset,” said Tenchi.
“But Tenchi,” said Ryoko with tears in her eyes.
“No buts!  Now go apologize to Ayeka,” said Tenchi.
“I’m pregnant with your child! Happy!” cried Ryoko.
“WHAT!” said Tenchi.
“Give me your hand,” said Ryoko.  Tenchi placed his hand on Ryoko and felt 
something moving inside.
“AHHHHHHHHHHHH!” screamed Tenchi as he fainted.  Ayeka turned her head to 
see what had happened and saw Henrii behind her.
“Princess Ayeka are you ok?” asked Henrii.  Ayeka stood up higher and tried 
to be brave.
“I’m ok Commander,” said Ayeka.  Henrii placed his hand on Ayeka shoulders 
and turned her around.
“Look into my eyes,” said Henrii.  Ayeka looked up looked at Henrii’s dark 
brown eyes.
“Yes,” said Ayeka.
“Everything will be alright, Ryoko probably lying because you poses a great 
threat to win Tenchi’s heart.  Maybe she wanted to make you upset and make 
you leave,” said Henrii looking into Ayeka’s purple eyes.
“Oh,” said Ayeka.  Henrii’s head moves closer to Ayeka and Ayeka started to 
blush and Henrii said to her.
“Everything will be alright, I promise Princess,” said Henrii
“Oh,” said Ayeka.  Henrii’s head moves even closer to Ayeka and said.
“Well I better get into the Osen so I can get clean up,” said Henrii with a 
smile.  Henrii turned around and headed for the Osen.  Ayeka fell to the 
floor with her leg twitching in the air.  Washu was standing outside of her 
lab and a toothpick was in her mouth.  Henrii stops in his tracks and looked 
at Washu.
“Morning Little Washu,” said Henrii.
“Just the guy I needed!” said Washu as she grab on to Henrii arm and pulled 
Henrii into her lab.   Down in Washu’s lab Henrii was locked onto the same 
table where Tenchi had his experiments done.
“Why do you need all these tests for anyway Washu?”
“Just to know more about you, that’s all,” said Washu as she was busy typing 
away.
“Oh ok Little Washu,” said Henrii.
“Ok, this watch is amazing it’s like a closet of clothes, battle suits, and 
other junk, its like Mihoshi cube,” said Washu in amazement as she placed 
his watch on her table.
“Yep,” said Henrii.  Washu walked up to him and placed her hand on Henrii’s 
naked chest,
“Well you are very healthy Henrii,” said Washu moving her hand around on 
Henrii’s chest.
“Thanks Washu,” said Henrii as he watched Washu moving her hand around his 
chest.
“195 lbs. with 98.7% muscle, 6 ft, blood type A positive, your family came 
from China, and IQ of 2050 and using 100% of the brain,” said Washu.
“China huh,” said Henrii
“That’s odd because most humans don’t have that kind of brain power,” 
questioned Washu.
“Well it was an accident during a lab experiment, I was trying to show brain 
waves of a human compared with a Juri brain wave.  I used my brain to 
compare with a Juri warrior.  When I place that device on my head it went 
crazy and shock me just enough that I didn’t die but my IQ went off the 
ceiling and could read people’s minds and such,” explained Henrii.
“Well I’m missing one test Henrii,” Washu said slyly as she looked down at 
Henrii’s crotch, which was covered by a unbreakable restraint.
“Oh no, you are not going there,” said Henrii.
“Oh yes,” replied Washu.  Henrii tried to get out.
“Would you like a full intercourse or oral,” said Washu in her nurse 
costume.  Oh no Henrii thought what am I going to do.  I got it!
“I will do a full intercourse with you but you got to let go these 
restraints it would be odd with these restraints,” said Henrii
“Ok!” said Washu happily.  She ran to her computer and freed Henrii from the 
restraints.  She turned around and saw Henrii’s naked butt running out the 
lab.
“Oh no you don’t!” cried out Washu.  She started to run after Henrii.
“AHHHHH!” said Henrii opened the lab door and slammed the door behind him.  
Mihoshi, Sasami, Ayeka, and Ryo-Ohki turned their heads to see what was 
going on.  Sasami, Ayeka, and Mihoshi saw Henrii butt naked and start to 
giggle.  Henrii looked down and saw that he wasn’t wearing any pants.
“Oh geez!” said Henrii as he blushed and ran upstairs trying to cover as 
much as he can.  Washu opened her door and said to Sasami, Mihoshi, and 
Ayeka.
“Did you see a Henrii anywhere?” asked Washu.
“He went upstairs,” three girls said to Washu and giggle.
“Thanks,” said Washu as she went upstairs.
“AHHHHHHH!” screamed Henrii.
Tenchi was out in his field pulling out huge carrots out of the ground.  I 
can’t be a father he thought.  I’m way too young to become a father.  I’m 
not sure if I’m going to be a good father.  Maybe I should ask Henrii to see 
is Ryoko is lying to me, he said he could read minds.  Well I should be 
heading back home then.  When Tenchi arrived home after he placed all the 
carrots into the storage room.
“Lord Tenchi you are home!” said Ayeka standing up from the couch.
“Hello Ayeka, odd where is Ryoko?” asked Tenchi.
“Probably dunk somewhere on her way home,” said Ayeka.  All of sudden Ryoko 
teleported in front of Ayeka.
“Sorry honey I was figuring out names for the baby,” said Ryoko.
“Oh ok,” said Tenchi sweating and scratching his head.
“If it’s a boy we should name it Tenchi Jr. and if it’s a girl well let name 
it Tenchi Jr.” smiled Ryoko.
“Wait a second Ryoko, let talk to Henrii to see if you are lying to us,” 
said Ayeka.
“Yeah I think so Ryoko because I don’t remember making love with you last 
night,” said Tenchi.
“Where is Henrii anyway?” said Mihoshi?
“Miya?” said Ryo-Ohki.
“HELP!” screamed Henrii.
“Sounds like he is upstairs,” said Sasami.
“Miya miya,” said Ryo-Ohki.  Everyone went upstairs to find where Henrii 
was.  They heard Henrii in Tenchi’s room.  In Tenchi’s room Washu changed 
into her adult form was slowly taking off her clothes while walking to him.
“I finally got you where I want you.  Don’t worry Henrii,  I’m not going to 
hurt you, hard hehehehehe,” said Washu.  Henrii was on the very end of the 
room trying to cover himself.
“Umm Washu can we talk about this instead?” said Henrii.
“Well lets see here… no,” said Washu getting closer and closer to Henrii.
“Don’t make me use my powers, Washu,” said Henrii.  Henrii placed his finger 
on his head and stop Washu from moving closer to him.  Henrii got up and 
started to find a towel to cover him.
“What are you doing Henrii?” said Washu.  Henrii got a towel from Tenchi’s 
drawer and placed it around his waist.
“Sorry Washu, I really like you but I don’t think I really like you that 
much to make love with you in two days when we met,” said Henrii.  Henrii 
threw a towel on Washu who was almost topless.
“I’m not doing this to make love with you, I just need a sperm sample,” said 
Washu in a upset tone.
“Weird way to get it Washu, by the way were is my watch?” said Henrii with a 
smile and headed for the door.
“Its in my lab, can you let me go so I can put on my clothes,” said Washu.  
All of a sudden Washu can start to walk again started to put on the towel 
around her chest.  There was a knock on the door before Henrii could open 
it.  Tenchi and the girls peeked into the room.
“Henrii?” said Tenchi.
“Commander?” said Ayeka.
“Washu?” said Sasami.
“Hi Henrii and Washu!” said Mihoshi.
“Henrii, I never knew you had it in you to make love with my mother,” smiled 
Ryoko.
“What! This is not what you think it is,” said Henrii scratching his head.  
Tenchi opened the door all the way.  And Ayeka and Mihoshi covered Sasami’s 
eyes.
“Sure,” winked Ryoko.
“My room! What happened to my room!  And my bed is all mess up!  Please 
don’t tell me that you!” exclaimed Tenchi.
“I will clean it up Tenchi, but,” said Henrii.  Washu in her 12-year form 
came up to Henrii and placed her arm around his arm.
“That was beautiful Henrii next time in my lab,” said Washu as she skipped 
out of the room humming a song.  Everybody stared at Henrii.
“Say Tenchi dear will our love be as strong as Henrii and Washu?” said Ryoko 
holding his arm.
“Umm err,” said Tenchi turning red.
“Why you!” said Ayeka and was cut off by Henrii.
“Well anyway she is lying, I never made love to her and your room was messed 
up because I tried to escape Washu and had to jump onto your bed,” said 
Henrii.
“Are you really sure?” said Tenchi.
“I’m sure, by the way, Ryoko is not having your baby.  If you wonder how 
come Ryoko stomach moves because she just can,” said Henrii as he left 
Tenchi’s room and started to whistle to the door of the Osen.  Tenchi went 
into his room with Ryoko on his arm saying sorry, and Ayeka laughing at 
Ryoko.  Tenchi took his sheets off his bed and carried it.
“Ryoko you lied to me.  You scared me so much!  I better get this clean just 
in case Henrii is lying to me too,” said Tenchi.
