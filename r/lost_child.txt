>>Poor child, your life is nothing but pain.
The man who said he created you wants to destroy you soul.
To make you nothing more than his puppet of destruction.
To have no will of your own, no conscience and to become like him.

  Be strong child; do not give into him.
If you can not fight him psychically, fight him mentally.
Never give into him for you were created with great powers for a better purpose, You are an important part of this universe's future.
He calls you "little ningyo", slave, yet not even a slave has to deal with the Torture you endure daily, any normal human would have died within a week...maybe Even less than that.

  Stay strong little one and you will be rewarded.
You are so alone it is not good to be alone.
There is one in the future for you, once you find him all the pain will be gone for his love shall be strong.  He shall be your reward.<< 

  She sent the child a mental picture of a young man around seventeen.  
>>He is so different from Kagato<< the child thought.  
He looked strong, but very kind and caring.  
>>He is the one I wait for?<< she asked.  
>>Yes child he is the one I promise to you<< Miaow replied.
>> I must be lucky if after all I've done I'll be able to have some one as kind as him...and he's cute too.<< the child said in awe.

  Miaow smiled >>You are right not many men are like him. 
But remember this destruction is not you fault but Kagato's, he is the one who forces you to steal and to destroy worlds.  I must leave now for you will not be able to get the full benefits of your sleep if I stay and Kagato would punish you for not being ready to fight.<<

 >>Eeh<< the child replied. As Miaow left the child's mind she whispered.
>>Sleep well little Ryoko for you shall be free.<<
