BACKGROUND (22/10/2000) : 

Heh, I had a rather bad spell wif a friend of mine who was
giving me C&C yesterday, and somehow I got the impression 
he was flaming me. Anyway I lost my head, then he lost his. 
I was so upset I juz went to my word processor and this 
Prologue emerged at my fingertips ^_^, although I was 
raging at the time.

XXXXX, if u really are out there, I juz want to let u noe,
this fic is for you... ^_^. If we make it up to each other,
I'll write your name here wif your blessings, and dedicate 
this piece to you.

Basically this fic does not change the plot, juz answers many
numerous questions about the character's nature and where
he really stands with respect to Washu.

I've shown this to my Proofreader Serajadeyn and he gives me
the thumbs up, saying this will not interrupt or make the fic
weaker, so here it is ^_^.

That's about it, I'm a simple soul at heart...

DARKNESS & LIGHT - No Need For Kova

By Zyraen

PROLOGUE : No Need for Liberation

Okay, time to check…

Putting down his pen, he quite casually flicked through his course
completion paper, checking to make sure that all was to his
satisfaction before he submitted it. First he went through the
elementary open ended answers.

Right, right, right, wrong, wrong, right, right, wrong, right right, right,
right, wrong, right…

Satisfied with his solutions, he moved on to his experimental
planning, including the essay on the procedure as well as the
necessary calculations involved.

Bad point, standard point, good, bad. Standard, good, wrong, good
point, standard, bad…

Still not touching his pen he checked his calculations, and noted
that there was an intermediate value that he substituted a wrong
constant for.

There… I’m done.

He glanced at his watch.

Ah well, looks like it’s fifteen minutes more.

Turning his paper over, he sat back and picked up his pen, as the
rest of the candidates bustled on their work. Twirling the pen about
absently in his fingers, to an onlooker he would have seemed a
candidate stumped by a question, but this is what went through his
mind.

Heh, no Alpha this time round again…

====================================

My ticket to freedom…

His fingers ran tenderly over the smooth metallic surface of the
sleek unit he had built, with its silver surface shining back at him,
and the gleam from its shine lighted up his blue eyes behind his
steel spectacle frames with joy and anticipation. They trembled with
excitement as he admired its surface, of adamantine, silvery steel…

He had known all along what he would call it, right from the time he
conceptualised it. There was a perfect name, an item that
symbolised its speed and range and size and deadliness.

Oh yes, it was deadly. 

He thought to himself with a smile. It had taken a long time and
much of his energy, ingenuity, combined with all the new things he
had learnt, along with many other not so conventional avenues of
knowledge, to finally fit the device into the unit. And he would have
left back then, about ten months ago, except that he had learnt
about a new item he could use.

The professor had returned to a warm reception, which she greeted
with her usual, typically endearing modesty, to embrace her
chairmanship. To tell the truth, he had been surprised at her
appearance and demeanour, even though he already knew how she
looked like.

I wonder if she would have made a good spy, he had thought.

Since then, he had learnt more about her, and most interestingly, of
her latest invention…

He sighed as his hands left the surface of the metal.

What a wonderful piece of work…

He frowned.

This is my weapon. It is my defence, my ticket out of here. And that
is all it is…

It was dangerous for him at times, and things were getting more
difficult now. Assuming another personality, while only minorly
different from his own, was trying on his energies, and there were
times the pseudo person within him threatened to overwhelm his
old, pragmatic, energetic, eager and enterprising side. Now, being
himself again, he cast a critical look at the unit.

All along, it had troubled him that his creation had no convenient
way of entering or leaving, had no… user mobility. 

I must get this done… It will be done. He turned away.

Then glanced back at the unit. 

It would open the world, the galaxies… I will be able to roam freely,
fearing nothing… the universe beyond this drab, ascetic place
called to him…

He closed his eyes, and whether it was truly him or his pseudo
personality that thought next, he knew not, which was
discomforting in itself.

It can wait… I can leave any time… only when I leave I *must* be well
equipped.

Reluctantly he wrenched his gaze from the unit, and let his other
consciousness take over him completely. Settling into his bench, he
looked through the paper, and his latest designs and calculations,
refreshing his mind, before pulling from the machine in front of him
all the materials and tools he needed, plus some other non-standard 
material he had gathered for the purpose of this project.

It would have been extremely difficult, but his mind was still fresh
from his previous attempts and experimentation with the other
project of his, so it wasn’t as difficult as it might otherwise have
been. 

====================================

It was after a seven-day sabbatical in his workroom, islolated,
having worked for nearly a hundred and sixty hours, that his worn
and haggard figure finally let out a sigh of relief. 

Thank god for my enhanced stamina, he thought.

Beside him was an empty container, slightly over three litres
capacity, and its insides were stained brown. By its side was an
empty cup, also stained brown here and there.

And for caffeine.

Forcing his bleary eyes open, he tested the weapon against the
laptop he had, by placing it on a pad linked to his terminal.

Yes, perfect… the balance, everything had been maintained. I have
lost no edge, lost no ground in this aspect. The DNA reactive
component was still within too, as well as the signature mark.

Excitement and exhilaration, as he had often craved experiencing,
rushed into his veins again, driving away his weariness, and he
picked the device off the pad, holding it in his hand, and turned so
he had the space to test his device out.

Blue light filled the room as he activated the device, and lit his face
up in a splendid azure glow, causing the steel frame of his glasses
to shine cerulean, and made his neatly parted brown hair seem to
darken to black. Smiling somewhat, he swung his device around a
little.

Good, that function still works, but it was in there already, and
elementary anyway.

He picked up something a corner on the floor, something that
looked like a hollow cylinder, but with what looked like synthetic
fibres and some grey, synthetic skin in the middle. Wires ran from it
to his terminal. Tapping the tip of the rod twice with his thumb, he
inserted the rod into the cylinder, and let go.

Nothing changed it seem, except for the numbers on the screen.

Not bad… he read the numbers off. Reaction time point zero five
seconds, voltage two thousand. Okay… now for the most crucial
test.

Tentatively, trying to force himself to stay calm, he gently shifted the
item, a certain point out, and pride and joy swelled in him as he
beheld a small gap, a void…

Gingerly picking up a tool from the bench by his side, he lobbed it
into the rift, and another rift opened up at the opposite end of the
room, where the object fell out.

EUREKA! IT WORKS! All right! I’m great, ain’t this neat!?

His brows furrowed together.

Right, big deal. What did you expect? You pulled all the right spots,
correct?

Trembling, he drew it up before him, then his eyes were staring into
the unknown darkness, into nothingness…

It will work…

One by one, he steadily gathered up all the remaining items from the
workbench, and lobbed them gently through the hole. Each and
every one emerged at the far end of the room…

All right, it should work… does work… all my calculations and
designing are precise, besides records have it that at least four
people have used such a portal, including the great Washu herself,
so it should work…

You’re getting soft, part of his mind snorted back at him. Hello?

He grinned dangerously.

Here goes then…

====================================

"There you are, Yoda," an eager, husky voice greeted him as he
emerged from his room. "I’ve been looking for you."

He sighed, his voice gravelly, even though he had treated himself to
some cups of soothing tea and a good four hours’ rest since he
completed what he deemed his magnum opus. "So, what is it now,
Marasa?" He turned to face the voluptuous, svelte brunette wearily.

Her laughter sounded as she caught his expression of distaste in
his words and face, and his scowl deepened in response. "Come
on, why are you such a tough nut to crack?" she joked.

He rolled his eyes. "Am I the only guy in this entire Academy that
you haven’t slept with?"

"Well… the only one who looks under thirty-five, I guess."

"Who are into the bets you ladies are laying on laying me?" He
asked, sounding almost accomodating. Marasa wasn’t the worse of
them, and he might have to keep on his toes for the others. He still
felt the fear the first time he had been approached, over thirty years
ago. Not to mention one day when he spotted someone trying to
spike his drink with aphrodisaic.

"Let’s see…" Marasa thought. "Me, Karima, Janimi, Gesuki, and
Sekura."

He smiled, slightly to himself. One of the reasons why he let Marasa
come near him was that she was in a way, the most trusting and
open, and she wasn’t as forward as the others. In his eyes, she was
the pick of a very bad lot. "Only? What happened to Tamura?"
Though he knew, of course.

"She said she wasn’t interested in you ‘bastard’, and that if we were
thinking to get you, we had better take care." Marasa thought a bit.
"She’s a real looker, you know that? What happened anyway?"

"Heh," his smile broadened. 

The woman had been astonished when he casually ordered her out,
despite her being well… dressed in her birthday suit, then became
dumbfounded as he, looking straight and disinterestedly at her,
casually started tossing glass vials at her. Barely half a second after
the first one had sailed just by her head and smashed into the wall,
he noted her face had turned pale when she heard the hissing
crackle as the acid inside ate into the wall. The next vial just barely
missed her body, then she had turned to make a run for it. He had
tossed two more after her, aiming to miss, as usual, just to make
sure. 

"Believe me, Marasa, you don’t want to know." He laughed a little
more. "You really don’t want to know."

"So… none of them have gotten to you yet, right?"

"I should think so." He said carefully.

"They say you pretend they don’t exist…"

"I suppose it is rather hard to lay a person who can’t seem to notice
you…" He replied cautiously.

"That makes me special to you!" Marasa announced jubilantly.
"Come on, you acknowledge me, you talk to me, you greet me, but
you don’t bother with them…"

He frowned. "Look, that’s because you aren’t as extreme as them.
Believe me, if you try something like what they do, I’ll treat you no
differently." He paused a while. "Besides, you are willing to tell me
things without bargaining with me." He sighed again. "And why the
hell are you people bothering with me at all? I’m not handsome, not
brilliant in the Academy, never got an Alpha in the past ten years,
never won any prizes, and hell I’m shorter than you with your
high-heels on!" 

"Oh…" she looked uncertain, then laughed. "Well almost all the
other tough guys have been taken care of in one way or another…
there’s only you from the under thirty-five category left."

"Look, I’ve told you people before and I say it again, I am NOT under
thirty-five! I came in when I was twenty-five, and that was frigging
*forty* years ago!"

"Heh… but you look it, and that’s what counts… besides…" she
laughed. "Out of our group, how many of us do you think are
*really* under twenty-five?"

"None." He answered, without a doubt. "Look, I got to go now, so if
you please…" He turned and moved…

She reached out to seize his arm, but he ignored it, his pace not
slowing in the least. Marasa cursed as she ran two steps, still
refusing to let go, and jumped…

He didn’t pause as her lithe, slim, youthful seeming arms wrapped
around his shoulders, instead his pace didn’t slow, and she had to
keep her feet moving quickly or be dragged of him.

"Marasa, I am *warning* you. If you were any one of the others, I’d
have gripped you by the neck as you tried that," He answered, his
voice calm and steady.

"But don’t you…?"

"I have never known love before, and I don’t intend to learn it from
you harlots."

Something in Marasa riled at that. "HEY! I’ll have you know I got
straight Alphas for all the projects and test in my advanced space
technology course!"

"I am warning you *again*. I have no qualms about striking those
who try this kind of thing. Now I will count to three, and if you’re still
with me by then, I *assure* you you will wake up in the infirmary
twelve hours from now. And if you even try choking me…"

Marasa’s eyes widened as she felt a cold metal point press hard
against her clothing into her side.

"One…"

She felt herself recoil in fear.

"Two…"

She heard his cold, steely words again… ‘I’m warning you…’ and let
go.

He was almost five metres down the corridor from her before she
stood steadily back on her feet.

"Damn you Yoda!" She cried, frustration and anger in her voice.
"Why won’t you give!?"

"Because I never will… not to your kind." His pace didn’t slow. 

"Now one of the others will get to you!"

"Your concern is noted, but badly misplaced." His receding figure
sent a mocking laugh down the corridors. "Thank you, Marasa,"
and disappeared around a corner.

*DAMN*, Marasa thought, grinding her teeth together. Could have
sworn he was warming up to me… he even laughed.

Cursing at how she had been thwarted, she went back to her room
to bury herself in her latest project…

====================================

Stepping back into the room, he smiled to himself as he looked
about the one of many Virtual Reality chambers within the Science
Academy. These were generally set up to go about the room, and
the settings and options available on the programs were generally
suited to the program used. Students themselves were welcome to
write programs that detailed and reacted to some stimuli, as well as
insert random processes into the VR program.

This particular room was one of the semi-arena types, used for
larger programs, and he had written, or rather modified, various
programs for the purposes of testing it out here, an activity he also
called ‘practice’. In response to his enhanced reactions, he had
taken the liberty of speeding up the program speed levels by about
fifty percent, and randomised it.

Sensory cameras were mounted from various angles about the
room, so they could see through the VR, as well as observe the
simulation, although this was rarely the case unless operators
deemed it fit for it to do so. Unfortunately, there were other, more
conventional ways to confound the cameras.

He grinned as he noted the photos pasted to the front of the
cameras. They had not even seen him enter the room. After he had
been done with them, he had donned the skin tight simulation suit,
which effectively covered his whole body. The suit was flexible and
designed to exert pressures of varying force and strength on
various parts of the body. Within it there was a thin, disposal inner
suit of material that was actually in contact with the skin of the user,
and every user was expected to fit in a new one and dispose of it
after use, for hygiene purposes. Now there left only the headgear for
him to don, and he removed his spectacles followed by his contact
lenses.

Remember, he reminded himself. First half an hour, space warfare,
next half hour, blaster training. The next half hour will be solely the
silver rod, then the next one hour, the laser armaments, and for the
next one and a half that, a wild free for all.

As he put on the light headgear that would simulate his eyes and
ears, the room dissolved away…

As always he felt a pang of nostalgia, as he sat down at the helm of
his ship, to look out upon the darkness of space, and the familiar
controls and consoles. In reality it had been forty years since the
Wanderer had fallen to ruins…

Then he grinned as he felt the old thrill race through his veins, his
ship sensors picked up over five enemy ships approaching from
various directions homing about his coordinates… In a breast
pocket his blaster was nestled, an old companion whom he never
quite could bring himself to forsake, while else where about him, a
silver rod…

Bring them on… he thought, as he manuevered the Wanderer into a
headspin, and golden lasers streaked through the darkness of his
space, barely missing the outline of the swiftly moving ship. 

Silver beams shot out from within his ship, to race towards the
enemy craft locked on in his sights, and as the enemy came flying in
and loosing salvoes in retaliation, Yoda Shiro gradually dissolved
into nothingness.

====================================

He sipped his tea, and gave a loud sigh of contentment.

Oh man, that was one great work out! It is great to exercise after
seven days in that miserable room of mine…

He smiled, as he thought how he had emerged from the VR room,
adrenalin running through him in surges. It was satisfying to know
he held his own against a simulated character that was
programmed to NEVER be defeated, as well as having just about
random and swift execution of numerous moves and strokes he
could gather from all the fighting organisations about the universe.

Okay, on to the next task at hand…

It is logically sound and understandable, given the nature of
subspace dimensions, that they can be used to carry out
experiments as they obey all the rules of the universe they currently
inhabit. Therefore it follows that I can store things in here, and even
travel through here.

Carefully, gingerly, he open the insides of the silvery unit, and
adhered the functions to controls, so he could employ his latest
addition to his arsenal.

Heh, piece of cake. It’s just about controlling and applying stimuli…
should be done in a jiffy. Then I can pay a visit to some of my old
friends.

====================================

Humming lightly to himself, he crawled through the narrow passage
way. It was so narrow there was no way he could even bend his
elbows, except to dig into the sides of the shaft, and his shoulder
muscles had to strain continuously to curl down and in front of him
so he would not get stuck. The designer had assumed, rightly, that
no one in his right mind would go through the ventilator system.
Unfortunately, the person obviously never counted on a person not
being in his right mind in the first place, and of a person who was as
determined as he was.

His body cut across yet another one of the invisible infrared lines,
but no alarm went off. Which was no big deal really. After learning
how to alter the security settings here, which incidentally took him
well over six months to figure out, it had been no worry at all.

It was much easier now, than it was when he first arrived, due to his
enhancements, but the rite of passage was nevertheless still a
grueling exercise even for one such as him. That it was an exercise
he welcomed, a way to keep in shape, was one of the reasons why
he employed this method of access rather than using the subspace
rift he had just learnt how to use. The other reason is that
occasionally, he had to admit saw some pretty interesting things
from where he wandered. Sleeping, busy people, people having fun
together… Although it was old, in a way it was still an experience, to
never cease wondering at how one who looked drab, uninteresting
and utterly ascetic in the day could be comely, serene and human
as one slept.

Ah, here we are, the last room.

There wasn’t enough space for him to see through past his hands
to what he was doing, but his fingers worked nevertheless, sliding
out from his long sleeves the various tools he would need. First a
sight tube went through, to check on the room, and the headgear he
wore projected an image of a slumbering person, in the darkness of
the shaft, and he knew it was safe to proceed.

Securing the cover first with certain removable hinges, he then
inserting a flexible screw driver through the thin slits in the cover
and unscrewed the covers. Pushing gently, the cover swung down,
soundlessly as the hinges dampened the movement, and worked to
prevent it from making any sound.Wriggling through the shaft like a
worm, he emerged from the ventilator, until his shoulders were free.
Removing a thick bar from within his works, he placed it before him,
in the air, it stayed there, hovering as he turned it on. Gripping it
firmly with both hands, he pulled the rest of his body out from the
shaft, then pressing another button on the bar, let it levitate down
until his feet soundlessly came into contact with the floor four
metres below the opening of the shaft.

Letting go of the levitating bar, he took a glance at the restful figure,
with his broad face, in life too often wearing a gregarious smile. No
one would have thought this sunny person could actually be a spy
for the Syndicate, and he did his work rather well, at least for his
level. However, the one who watched his repose knew better.

His gloved hands sifting through the scans he knew the person
always kept in a secret compartment, he checked the data, as he
customarily did, once a month. He made it a point to monitor these
spies as best as he could, as the Science Academy was full of
potentially promising material that, if brought to the attention of
either Jurai, Galaxy Police, or the Synera Stellar Syndicate, could
result in the creation of a weapon that could well incite an
inter-galactic war as the empire with the advantage struck out in bid
to seek universal dominion.

Quite ironically, it was himself that held in his hands such an item,
but he had no intention to ever let anyone alive know about it being
in his possession.

After all, it is only to be used in self defence and extreme
circumstances. My own EMP device should suffice to deal with
regular threats.

Well, looks like he also has this particular gem… he thought as he
looked at the note. 

It was not the deadly armament that he himself had acquired, just a
modest notes on insidious biological warfare and on mutating then
mass producing a very rare, almost unheard of virus strain that
could well spell calamity for countless colonies throughout the
galaxy. 

Quite carefully, he opened a portal with his rod, and reached in, to
produce a piece of paper, and part of him marvelled at this particular
invention’s utility.

Truly Washu is a genius of the highest order!

He smiled at the sleeping man. It had been over four years this
person had obtained a lover in the Academy, a lady, whose
chambers he had visited about half an hour ago. It might have been
a coincidence that she also had this piece of vital information, but
he doubted it. After all, she was working for the Juraians. As for who
stole from who, he sincerely didn’t give a damn for.

As he did earlier, he picked up the piece of offending information,
and replaced the paper with a slip that was utterly identical, except
in one crucial aspect - the virus strain would not in fact be a long
lived one. By altering several minor points on altering the mutation
of the original strain, it would be such that the virus would be
unable to reproduce in any form, and effectively cause its own
extinction. If it did survive, it would be harmless, as it produces
non-toxic products. Also, the original name of the virus strain, by
changing a single letter in the spelling, would in fact refer to a
different, more common strain, which would die in the process of
undergoing the alterations, both original and modified.

Jumping back onto the bar, still hovering soundlessly, slightly
below two metres above the ground, he reached up with his hands
at the ventilator shaft and the cover. Removing from the cover the
hinges, he tossed into the rift that was still below him, where he had
taken out the paper, and replaced the cover, taking care to screw it
back on securely.

Then opening the portal he got back down on the floor, and using
his silver rod to widen the portal, stepped through, to emerge back
into his own room.

It is indeed a splendid tool, he marvelled as he admired the
subspace rift. Finally settling down for a rest, he carefully tore the
tanned skin off his face, removed the small folds of fat under his jaw
and around his cheeks, as well as the flesh toned material that
lowered his jawline. He pulled the tanned brown gloves from his
hands, and removed the extra material that made his fingers seem
thicker and shorter than they really were. Applying some powder to
his fingers, he ran his fingers through his grey hair, and it became
lustrous brown. Then he clipped his shoulder length hair together,
close to his scalp, then combed it neatly into his customary side
parting.

"Welcome back, Yoda," he smiled to himself. 

There was one room that he feared entering though. That was the
lab in the higher level of the Academy, belonging to a particular
professor Washu. He had only ever been there once, and much
knowledge he had gleaned in there. Most significant was how to
actually reduce the mass required for a device to create the rift, and
the other was so astonishing, he almost could not believe it.

His weapon had far greater destructive power than he had ever
imagined. Unfortunately, even the original device was so difficult to
miniaturise, he knew it would be folly to attempt to alter it further for
adjustable controls, and still hope to fit it into his unit.

Since that visit, he had never dared enter the lab again. He knew it
was safer not to take chances, and besides, he had often the
suspicion that she had her sights on him, as in found his activities
noteworthy, and might be on his trail.

He might have rested more easily if he had known Washu never
flipped through or checked her paper notes. She had only made
copies in obligation for the Science Academy rules, and all of the
material she actually made reference to were stored in her spectral
computer. 

However, he was right in his suspicion that she was watching him.
Of all the pupils, she had found him noteworthy for the extent of his
range of knowledge, and the nature of his projects. It had also been
somewhat astonishing for her to note that he had, in the course of
forty years, he had consistently achieved between Beta and Delta
for his course graduation papers and his projects. Alpha
achievement had only been awarded to him twice, apparently
happening only once every twenty years… His projects, while full of
promise, tended to achieve mediocre results due to some
experimental planning, design or calculation flaw, rather than
conceptual errors.

Looks like I am finished here…

====================================

Ah…To be free… to be free at last…

These thoughts filled his mind as his eyes sprang open from his
sleep, and a smile of pleasure crossed his face…

Then he sighed…

I shall miss this place. It has been okay while it lasted.

His mind wandered far away, to admire the beauty and wonder of
the countless landscapes he had seen - awe inspiring rock
formations, monuments to nature’s majesty; frigid barren tundras
and the sweltering parched deserts, forbidding and lifeless, yet also
captivating and teeming with unseen lifeforms ; ivory sands of
beaches flanked by towering cliff heights, a beautiful contrast of the
serenity of nature against its heights ; of galaxies and nebulas of
stars, splitting through the darkness in myriad colours and forms
and lights, each and every one unique, reminding him of the
ubiquity of beauty even in the emptiness of space.

Yes, it’s been nice here, but I’ve got to move on. The rest of the
universe is waiting out there, and now I should be able to handle
them tolerably, with the knowledge and changes that I have formed
about myself here…

But my experiments, my projects? There is so much more to learn,
so much more knowledge to glean, so many more fields to delve
into, countless wellsprings of information untapped…

I’m sorry, but I *have* to leave. I think I’m being watched, and I have
always trusted my instincts. Also, I don’t wish to stay here forever, I
wish to apply what I have learnt out there…

Ah well, I guess you are right. It might work… just an experiment,
right?

He smiled.

Right, I guess. This life is an experiment, after all, I have no idea
where I’m going.

Hmm, application on the spot… just like I used to do…

Yes.

He walked towards the silvery shiny unit. 

It is time to face the world out there again.

Opening it, he settled down comfortably into the seat.

Are you ready? Will you help me?

The silver rod was inserted into a hole within the unit, and appeared
at the tip, mounted at the front of the craft.

Yes… but one last request, please…

There was a shudder in the room, then an inky darkness appeared
before the unit, and he could see through the glass into the void.

Okay… here we go then…

There was a rush of engines, barely discernible, as it ran so
smoothly… Then suddenly the room was empty.

====================================

High over the Science Academy, there was a flash of silver, as an
object appeared in orbit over it. Within it, someone looked, even as
he was dying.

There… take a good look.

The blue eyes rove over the place below him. From above here, the
complex was nowhere as impressive as it looked, after all it had
been built for Science, not for aestethics. The watcher looked down,
remembering all the memories and exhilarations, of the objects
created, the successful projects, of fathoming secrets and
achieving objectives through sheer hard work and determination.

The space craft hung in the air for a long time, unseen and
unnoticed.

All right… I’m ready.

Very well then, let’s go.

As his hand pushed the throttle up, the ship raced forward into the
darkness of space.

And I shall embrace what the fates have in store for me…
