     Tara Maclean - If I Fall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     It seems so far to go
     It took so long to get here
     Now I'm saying things I swore I'd never say
     And I'm afraid again

     I thought I had it in me
     I used to be so sure
     There I was stronger than ever
     Here I am blaming the hurt

     And if I fall
     I will find a way back to my hands
     I'm the only one who can help me find my feet
     Again
     Sweet little fighter
     Sweet little scar
     Sweet little fire in my heart

     It seems so easy now
     Everything I dreamed about when I was a child
     It looks like a good place here
     So I think I'll stay for awhile

     And if I fall
     I will find a way back to my hands
     I'm the only one who can help me find my feet
     Again

     You came here screaming
     And never stopped to listen to your one and only prayer
     A place for you somewhere

     Sweet little fighter
     Sweet little scar
     Sweet little fire in my heart

	SATURDAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The school year in Japan ends in March, and the Graduation Ceremony is held on a 
Saturday Night near the end of the month.  On this particular night, the winds were brisk 
and it was snowing lightly.  Tenchi was in his room, donning his school uniform for the last 
time.  The last few months had seen him going through a final growth spurt: he's taller now, 
his shoulders have broadened a bit, and his voice has deepened a little.  The most 
noticeable change has been to his face, which is now leaner and more planar.  His uniform 
now fits snugly, and he has to struggle to with it.
     Nobuyuki's voice echoed up the stairs.  "Tenchi!  I'm going out to warm-up the van.  
Hurry up!"
     "Ok, Dad," Tenchi answered, "I'll be down in a minute."  He finished brushing his hair 
and picked up the stack of wrapped gifts from his desk.  One last inspection in the mirror, 
and then he exited his room.  He was feeling a bit nostalgic, knowing that a chapter in his 
life was now closing.  That thought was still in his mind as started down the stairs -- and 
then he saw the six females in his life waiting for him at the bottom.  He stopped 
momentarily as he examined them.  The five humans were gorgeous: though they were wearing 
conservatively-styled dresses, each had modified her outfit to enhance her natural 
attributes.   And little Ryo-ohki had been thoroughly shampooed and combed, and wore a 
festive child's dress.  As he slowly descended the stairs, they bowed in unison, the four 
oldest nearly salivating as they waited for him.
     "Good evening, Tenchi," they all said.
     Tenchi stoped again and stared, speechless.
     "What's wrong, Tenchi?" Ryoko asked.  "Don't you approve?"  She indicated their 
clothing.
     "You're all very....beautiful.  You take my breath away."
     "Oh, he noticed!" Mihoshi said.
     "How could I not?"
     "What are you carrying, Tenchi?" Washu asked.
     "Oh, uh, I have gifts for each of you."
     "Shouldn't *we* be giving *you* a gift?" Ayeka inquired.  "You are the one graduating 
tonight."
     "It's my way of saying 'thank you' for all the time and patience you've shown to me."
     Washu spoke for all of them: "It's the least we could do for our future husband."
     Tenchi felt a pang of guilt.  Not over having proposed to all of his off-world 
houseguests, but that he simply did not have the money to purchase the proper symbols.
He had explained this to his alien entourage several times, but their answers were always 
the same: "Rings aren't important, intentions are important."  Still, his greatest wish
was that he could have placed a proper ring on the hand of each of them.  He finished 
descending the staircase and distributed his packages.  While Ryoko, Ayeka, Washu, Mihoshi, 
and Sasami opened their gifts -- in varying degrees of precision -- he knelt and handed the 
last gift to Ryo-ohki, who had resolutely maintained her humanoid form.  Her hands were 
clumsy, and Sasami giggled while watching her attempt to open the package.
     "You'd better help her, Tenchi, I don't think she's up to it yet," Sasami advised.
     Tenchi gently removed the gift from Ryo-ohki's fingers, and opened the wrapping paper. 
He was listening to the appreciative sounds around him, and smiled at their reactions.  He 
extracted a small box from Ryo-ohki's wrapping, opened it, and showed her the necklace 
inside.  It was of the choker type, made of elastic material and festooned with little 
baubles shaped liked stars and carrots.  Ryo-ohki "Miya-ed!" enthusiastically, and pulled 
her hair back to allow Tenchi to fasten the clasp at the back of her neck.  She rewarded him
with a big hug.  As he stood, he noticed that each of the ladies were fastening a brooch to 
her dress.  Each was an elaborate flower, decorated in the colors of the owner's eyes and 
hair: gold and cyan for Ryoko, red and violet for Ayeka, green and red for Washu, blue and 
yellow for Mihoshi, and pink and blue for Sasami.  He received enthusiastic embraces from 
all five of them. That's when Tenchi's father opened the front door and leans in.  "Yosho is
already waiting in the van.  Let's get going or all the good parking spots will be taken!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The Graduation Ceremony was one of those events Tenchi was frankly willing to forget.  
It was held in the school gymnasium, with rows of folding chairs down the middle to hold the
graduates, while the parents and family were seated in the bleachers.  The room had a stage,
which was where the faculty, podium, a couple of flags, and a table full of envelopes were 
placed.  All the graduates were dressed in their school uniform, which to Tenchi's way of 
thinking made them look like so many dominoes stacked together.  He daydreamed his way 
though the proceedings, looking for friends and familiar faces -- it wasn't hard to spot his
entourage: in a sea of black and gray hair, their rainbow-hued tresses were impossible to 
miss.  He waved discreetly at them once, and was rewarded with his father's camera lens 
pointing at him like a sniper scope.  It might have been embarrassing if half a hundred 
other fathers weren't performing the same ritual.  Talk about boring.
     He managed to stay awake, though, and was grateful when each row of students was 
instructed to stand and join the queue for the stage.  It moved briskly, as each student was 
allowed just so much time after his/her name was called to walk across the stage, exchange 
bows with the Principal, accept their diploma from the teacher at the table, and hustle down
the opposite stairway.  His only really embarrassing moment came when he accepted his 
diploma and the applause from his personal cheering section drew all sorts of attention.  
Fortunately, he only blushed, rather than the dreaded nosebleed.
     They were reunited at the Reception in the cafeteria after the ceremony.  Refreshment 
tables lined one wall, and the room was packed with knots of students and their families.  
Nobuyuki took plenty of photos of Tenchi with and without his ladies.  And then Nobuyuki and
Yosho wandered away to exchange pleasantries with old acquaintances, and Sasami dragged 
Washu and Ryo-ohki off towards the refreshment tables.
     Tenchi soon found himself in the center of a small crowd.  His classmates stood about 
in mute astonishment, wondering how Tenchi had managed to keep silent all this time about 
these exotic foreigners.  They openly stared at Ryoko, Ayeka, and Mihoshi: the boys focused 
on Ryoko's cleavage and fang-like teeth, Mihoshi's long legs and shapely derriere, and 
Ayeka's regal posture and classy carriage; the girls concentrated on their hair and eyes, 
and Tenchi heard whispered comments about 'iridescent dyes' and 'colored contact lenses.'   
Finally, Tenchi's friend Amagasaki screwed-up the courage to ask him who they were.  "They're
my family," he answered, pride tinged with embarrassment.  Then a ray of inspiration hit him: 
"They're here from California." 
     Mihoshi whispered a question to Ayeka: "Where's California?"
     Ayeka, ever in the know, replied, "On the closest edge of the continent due east of us.
The lifestyle there is similar to the colony on Jotaken."
     "Oh," said Mihoshi and Ryoko, familiar with the reference.  They smiled broadly for 
their clever Tenchi. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Washu, Sasami, and Ryo-ohki worked their way discreetly down the tables, sampling the 
various entrees.  Sasami's discerning palette identified ingredients and judged proportions,
and Washu made comments about the colors.  Neither, frankly, was impressed.
     "Remind me to fix Tenchi's favorite dinner tomorrow," Sasami told Washu.  Washu agreed.
     Ryo-ohki remained alongside Washu, munching on a carrot and looking into the faces of 
those who stared at her.  One young child tugged on his mother's dress and pointed at the 
cabbit, asking in a loud voice if Ryo-ohki was a baby werewolf.  He was silenced for his 
efforts.  Ryo-ohki blinked back innocently at him, and Washu had to bite the insides of her 
cheeks to keep from laughing out loud.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     "Masaki, you are such a wimp," said one heavily-muscled young man.  Tenchi bridled, but
pointedly ignored him.  So he turned to Ryoko, and asked, "Are you a cousin of his?"
     Ryoko batted her long eyelashes at the posturing young man.  "Actually, we're engaged,"
she purred, her arms entwining around one of Tenchi's.  Ayeka cleared her throat and shook 
her head, but Ryoko ignored her.  Tenchi studied the boy through half-closed eyelids.  Ryoko, 
Ayeka, and Mihoshi felt his Power level flicker.  From opposite corners of the room, Yosho, 
Washu, and Sasami felt it, too, and looked their way curiously.
     "What can you possibly see in him?"
     "I'm attracted to his big.....heart," Ryoko replied coyly.
     "Marriage before college?"  One bespectacled girl asked, clearly disapproving.
     "Maybe he's skipping college," said the young man, looking at Ryoko enviously.
     "Oh, I'm going on to college," Tenchi replied.  "Just not in Japan."
     "Are you attending one of those Southern California colleges?  You are *so* lucky," the
girl with the glasses looked jealous, too.  
     Tenchi could have told her the truth, that his great-grandfather had insisted that he 
attend an academy on Jurai (several hundred light years away) but decided against it.  In 
fact, he looked at the gorgeous alien attached to his arm and announced, "You look thirsty, 
Ryoko.  Let's find some punch.  Come on Ayeka, Mihoshi."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     The ride home was full of chatter, as the galactics compared notes on clothing, 
munchies, people, and the evening as a whole.  The only universal agreement was that Tenchi 
looked handsome in his school uniform.
     "I can't wait to take it off," he replied.
     "I'd be happy to help you with that little chore," Ryoko said sweetly, snuggling 
against him.  
     On his other side, Ayeka just sighed.  "You are so predictable, Ryoko."
     "You're just mad because I suggested it first, " she said to Ayeka.  To Tenchi, she 
whispered, "This time, let me unfasten the buttons."
     "What do you mean, 'this time?'" Ayeka snapped.
     "I really don't think it's any of your business, Little Princess."
     "If it involves my fiancée, it becomes my business!"
     "He's my fiancée, too, and it really doesn't concern you!"
     Tenchi rolled his eyes and sighed.  He wasn't really exasperated, or maybe not as much 
as used to be.  If it weren't for the high volume, he could tune them out.  Washu and Sasami
turned around and leaned over the seat back in front of him. 
     "Tenchi, did you sample those chocolate stars on the end of the first table?"
     "Yes I did, Sasami.  Actually, I thought they were pretty good."
     "You *liked* those?  E-w-w-w-w, I thought they had too much sugar in them."
     He was going to say something else, but didn't feel like shouting over the noise.  He 
raised one hand to signal a pause, then brought both hands over his head, around the 
shoulders of his seatmates, and back to his chest.  Ryoko and Ayeka made a strangled sound 
as Tenchi squeezed them into his armpits.  "Now, I'll make a deal with each of you ladies.  
If each of you can stay completely silent until we get home, I'll give you a big kiss."  
There was the unmistakable sound of hands being clamped over lips, and the back of the van 
grew suddenly silent.  "That's much better.  Now, what were you saying, Sasami?"
     Sasami giggled, and then returned to her evaluation of the chocolate stars.  Beside 
her, Washu looked down at Tenchi's seatmates, and just happened to see them exchanging 
conspiratorial winks and sly grins.  Then they noticed her watching them and stuck out their
tongues at her.  Washu was just considering the best way to exploit this information, when 
Mihoshi gasped and said, "There's a ship anchored in the lake!"
     "Can't be," Nobuyuki said from the driver's seat.  "The lake is frozen over."
     "Not any more it isn't," Mihoshi replied.  She was straining to see out her window, and
both Sasami and Washu leaned over to look where she pointed.  It wasn't late enough to be 
truly dark out, but the blowing snow made visibility difficult.  They could barely discern 
the outlines of a curved shape rising beside the dock, though it was nearly hidden by the 
steam wraiths that slithered off the choppy water.
     "She's right," Washu said.  "Looks like the lake was heat-flashed.  The ship's engines 
must be keeping the water from re-freezing."
     "Isn't your GP cruiser submerged in the lake, Mihoshi?" Sasami asked.
     "No, I parked Yukinojo in the meadow behind the shrine.  Washu put a cloak over it to 
conceal it."
     "Pesky spy satellites," Washu muttered.
     "I think it's an imperial shuttle," said Mihoshi.  "But it looks like a short-range 
model.  That would mean a long-range transport up in orbit."
     "And it would appear they've already made themselves at home," Yosho said from the 
front seat.  "The living room lights are on.  I guess we'll be meeting our guests in short 
order."
     "Damn," said Tenchi, accompanied by another Power spike.  Every eye in the van turned 
to look at him.  Tenchi rarely cursed.  "Looks like they wasted no time coming for me."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Nobuyuki parked the van near the front door, and everyone piled out quickly.  Their 
coats were soon flecked with snowflakes, and their heads were wreathed in mist.  
     "There is only one set of tracks," Ryoko said.  She had phased through the side of the 
van and flown down to the ship.  She had also considered just phasing through the vessel's 
side and taking a peek at the interior, but decided it would accomplish nothing.  And she 
wanted to be with Tenchi.  He was obviously upset, which made her upset.  And she didn't 
like being upset.
     "Well, let's go greet our guests," Yosho answered.  He started for the door -- but it 
opened before he could reach it, and a figure in flowing robes stood framed and backlit.
     "Mother!" Yosho gasped.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     "I've only been here a short while," Funaho explained.  "And it took me that long to 
figure out how to turn on the lights."
     "Sorry about that," Nobuyuki said, not knowing what else to say.  He couldn't help it 
if his house lacked the Juraian standard semi-sentient appliances.  This was Earth, after 
all, a backwater little frontier world.
     Funaho just waved it aside.  "No need."  She was sitting on the sofa, with Sasami and 
Ayeka flanking her.  Yosho and Nobuyuki sat across from them, and the remaining residents 
either sat on the floor or leaned against the wall.  Coats had been hung, shoes had been 
removed, and water was slowly coming to a boil on the stove in preparation for hot tea.  
"I'm just sorry I missed Tenchi's Graduation."
     "You didn't miss much, Lady Funaho," Tenchi replied.  He sat in a corner with Ryoko 
clinging to him.  He was unusually quiet, and appeared to be brooding.
     "But I got plenty of pictures!" Nobuyuki exclaimed.  "And I'll be happy to give you 
copies when they're developed."
     "Thank you, Mr. Masaki, that is very kind."
     "Where are you going, Sasami?" Funaho said.  Sasami had bounced off of the sofa and was
walking briskly towards the kitchen.
     "I've gotta go check on the water.  I'll be right back.  Tenchi, would you help me, 
please?"
     "Sure," he replied, too polite to refuse.  He struggled to his feet and strode off 
after Sasami.  Ryoko watched him go, torn between the need to be sociable and her desire for
her fiancée.  She sighed and leaned back against the wall.
     "Sasami, do you really need my help to look at the pot?"
     "No, but if it's boiling I could use your help getting it ready."
     "Oh."
     "And I wanted to ask why you're so upset."
     "Isn't it obvious?  I probably ought to go pack."
     "Don't you want to go to Jurai?"
     "Not yet.  I thought we'd take care of all of these weddings first.  And I just wanted 
a taste of freedom before I tackled my new responsibilities."
     "Oh, you want a vacation.  Here, help me lift this."  She handed him a pair of towels 
and gestured towards the pot.
     "Yeah," he said, tipping the pot so that's its contents would run into a serving 
pitcher.  "That, and I'm just tired of being ordered around so much."
     "Are you so sure she's here to fetch you back?"
     "Watch your hands.  No, I'm not positive, but the timing sure is coincidental."
     "Maybe you should just give her a chance to explain herself.  How many cups are up 
there?"
     "Six.  Let me grab a couple more.  And a carrot for Ryo-ohki."
     Sasami had to smile.  Even though Tenchi was anxious, he was still considerate of his 
friends.  They placed the tea set on a tray, added the tea, spoons, napkins, and the cabbit's 
treat.  Tenchi lifted the tray carefully.  "Tenchi?  Please promise me that you'll be 
patient with her?"
     "Ok," he sighed.  "I promise."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Tenchi carried the tray into the living room and set it on the coffee table.  Ryoko 
noticed that the tension seemed to have gone out of his posture; he wasn't smiling, but he'd
lost that caged animal look.  She caught Sasami's eye and flashed her a 'thumbs-up.'  Sasami
smiled and nodded.  Tenchi settled back onto the floor with Ryoko, and allowed her to rest 
her head on his shoulder.  Neither said anything, just watched Ayeka serving tea.
     The topic of conversation finally came around to her reason for being on Earth.  "I've 
come to take Tenchi and you girls back to Jurai," Funaho said.  She expected some reaction, 
but got total silence.  "Is there a problem?"
     "Yes there is, Mother," Yosho replied.  "We have four weddings to plan and perform."
     "Four weddings?  I thought you were holding just one large wedding.  Either way, I 
assumed they were to be held on Jurai."
     "No, we haven't really decided.  At the moment, we have tentatively settled on Ryoko's 
and Washu's ceremonies here, Mihoshi's on her home world, and Ayeka's on Jurai."
     "Why would you want to hold any of the ceremonies here?" asked Funaho.
     "Because we have no other friends or family," said Washu, "and we met him right here.  
We wanted Yosho to perform the ceremonies."
     "At the same time?"
     "Certainly not.  Ryoko's will be first, and then mine a month later."
     "A month?" exclaimed Funaho. "Why so long?"
     "You gotta allow for the honeymoon!" Washu cackled, her eyebrows wiggling with lecherous 
exaggeration.
     "And mine will be a month after Washu's," Mihoshi added.  "It will take my mother and I
at least that long to plan for it.  Not to mention travel time."
     "Ayeka?" 
     "Mine is last out of simple logistics.  And I thought you and Mother might need the 
extra time to plan for a royal wedding.  As I recall, they can be rather ostentatious."
     "Don't forget my betrothal banquet," Sasami added.
     "You're right, of course, on both accounts.  Do you ladies have actual dates set?"
     Yosho cleared his throat.  "No, nothing was going to be settled upon until after Tenchi
had graduated.  And a chance to discuss details with family members, of course."  
     "Maybe we ought to just elope," Tenchi said from the floor.  It was not a joke; it was 
not meant as one, and it was not received as one.
     Funaho said (as tactfully as possible), "That's not a very helpful suggestion, Tenchi."
     "Oh?  And what's so important happening on Jurai that won't wait?  I would like to 
remind you that I agreed to go there, but I didn't agree to a timetable.  Each of these 
wonderful ladies deserves her own special day, in the place of her choosing.  And I...."  
Tenchi had half-risen from the floor when he uttered a strangled sound and released a 
tremendous Power surge.  He convulsed once and collapsed.  Ryoko caught him before he hit 
the floor.  There were startled gasps from around the room.
     Washu scrambled over to examine him, growling at least once for everyone to get out of 
her light.  "Take him up to his room, Ryoko, I'll get some things from my lab and be 
right up."
     Ryoko nodded once, cradled Tenchi in her arms, and teleported up to his room.  She 
gently laid him on his bed and pulled the covers over him.  She sat beside him, leaning over
his chest to study his face.  "Not now," she whispered softly.  "This can't happen now.  I 
waited centuries for you.  You're the only man I've ever loved, and the only man who ever 
loved me."
     "I thought that's why we were getting married," he whispered back.  His eyes opened and
looked into hers.  He was disoriented, and his voice was strained.
     "If anything ever happened to you -- "
     " -- Then you'd raise our children to be proper little pirates."
     "We don't have any children," she chided him, a lump in her throat.
     "Yet," her corrected her, attempting a smile.
     There were voices in the hallway outside his room.  Washu opened the door, allowing 
Ryo-ohki (in her quadruped form) to slip in and hop onto the bed.  She climbed onto Tenchi's
chest, Miya-ed with concern, and curled into a ball.  "Hey," Ryoko snarled good-naturedly, 
"take a hike.  That's my spot."  Ryo-ohki ignored her.
     Washu sat between Tenchi and Ryoko, waived a portable sensor over him, checked his 
pulse, and took his temperature.  "What's the diagnosis?" he asked.
     Washu shrugged.  "Beats me.  I don't see anything wrong.  Tell you what, Tenchi: I'll 
put together a little gizmo in my lab tonight, and I want you to wear it for the next few 
days.  It will monitor your vital signs and send them down to my lab.  Maybe that way we can
get a handle on this thing."
     Tenchi nodded and absently scratched Ryo-ohki behind her ears.  That's when he noticed 
that she was still wearing the necklace.  He also noticed Ryoko and Washu were still wearing
their brooches.  "It's getting worse, isn't it?"
     "I won't lie to you, Tenchi.  Yes, it's getting worse.  But I don't think it's serious 
yet.  The best thing you can do now is to get some sleep." Rising, she pulled Ryoko to her 
feet and pushed her towards the door, where several faces were peering in.  "Doctor's orders:
the cabbit stays, the rest of you leave."  Washu watched them as they all filed out, giving 
Tenchi their encouragement.  Just before leaving she bent down to kiss him on the forehead.  
"Don't make me a widow before we're even married, ok?  Or, at least, not until you sign the 
insurance papers."
     "I'll see what I can do," he answered around a yawn.
     Washu extinguished the light and closed the door.  She quietly descended the stairs, 
only to find every eye in the room looking at her expectantly.  After a moment of silence, 
Funaho cleared her throat.  "Would you please explain what is going on?"
     Washu settled on the floor next to the coffee table and poured herself a cup of tea.  
"Two months ago we started observing a change in our boy.  He entered into a late growth 
spurt that added five inches to his height and nearly twenty pounds to his weight.  No real 
surprise when his appetite suddenly increased.  But in the last couple of weeks he's started
showing some mood swings that are totally uncharacteristic, and in the last few days he's 
begun releasing these Power spikes -- which appear to be growing in intensity.  We notice 
them the most when he's irritable or stressed.  We just figured it was nervous reaction to 
his high school graduation and planning for the weddings, but I'm beginning to think 
otherwise."
     "How serious is it?"
     "It's too early to tell," Washu replied.  She looked at the assembled faces.  "The best
thing you can do for him is just don't make a big deal of it.  He'll be embarrassed about it
in the morning, and a little teasing is to be expected.  Just don't make a fuss over him."
