**Aboshi**

Anji ran around the corner of the building almost
triping and falling on the ground, but catching her
balnce at the same time. Once she figured she got far
enough away to where she could walk, she slowed down.
It was a Dark cold night, the Moon was bright and the
stars stayed in their place's as time passed. The wind
had a light breeze to it, sometimes if the wind blew
just hard enough,you would get a chill. Anji began to
walk kinda slowly, she turned around and looked and
saw nothing exept her own shadow from a light uphead..
She turned back around and started walking up the
alley. She then sighed a long sigh and looking at the
ground,  an uneasy feeling uproached her as her foot
lifted in the air and then went back to the ground as
she walked. Her Black hair hang over her eye's alill
bit since she had it up pined back. Her eye's were a
Blue with a mix of purple to them, like a amythest
purple. She wore a dark color shirt, a dark navy blue,
and dark pants. Anji wore a klok that hang from her
shoulder's and than the cape part that hang down from
her not wearing it over her head. She  heard the wind
howle it's mysterious song, and then ended with a
silent tone. She brought her head up from looking at
the ground and froze. It was like she just got struck
in the back, and she could'nt move, stoned like a
statue.

"you knew you would'nt get that far" the Shadowy
person that was standing in front of Anji, broke the
silence.
"I never said that I would get that far did I?" Anji
spoke up.
"then why'd you run away?"
"why do you wanna know?, you know those Duraids are
just toys to me"
"Toys? you think they are toys? well lets see how much
you master up to my most faithfull one!" The Shadowy
person then lifted in the air and brought her right
hand out to her side. Then Anji looked down the alley
and saw a Shadow on the side wall, the shadow looked
small in size, as it got closer, the shadow on the
wall got Bigger. Then the Creature that Belonged to
the Shadow showed himself. He walked around the Corner
and didn't even turn his head at that moment. The
Creature was kinda slumped over, with spike's that
sprouted out his back, he had long big arm's and long
legs. When the creature turned his head towards Anji,
he opend his eye's and his eye's shown a Blood Red.
"KIILL HER" The Shadowy person  in the air Shouted at
the Creature. The Creature noded his head alill and
then he disapeared. Anji's eye's widned, not knowing
where he went, or where he was. She looked to her side
at the opening and saw nothing, then she looked behind
her.

**Yosho's Party**

Tenchi woke up yanwing, and then crawled out of bed.
Ryoko phased in front of him and hugged him.
"Hi Tenchi" Ryoko said still hugging him and grining.
"Ryoko..., hi Ryoko" Tenchi said giving up on saying
anything. Ryoko leaned back and then put her arms
around his neck to where it was nose to nose. At that
moment Sasami yelled for breakfeast. Ryoko smiled.
"See you at Breakfeast" Ryoko said takeing a step
backward and then phaseing into the kitchen.. A few
minutes later, when everyone was at the  table except
for Yosho and Nobuyuki, Sasami broke the silence.
"Tommorrow is Yosho's birthday, ya'll probley already
know that, I'm planning a Surprise Birthday Party for
him" Sasami said looking up from her food.
"Oh thats right I forgot" Mihoshi said.
"You always forget Mihoshi" Kiyone said arching an
eyebrow and glanceing at Mihoshi.
"would you like me to help you with the cake Sasami?"
Aeka asked looking at Sasami.
"yeah sure," Sasami said smileing.
"what time is the Surprise party gonna be?" Tenchi
asked looking up from his food.
"Omm.... I really dont know, maybe that night"
"oh okey"

After everyone got done eating, Ryoko disapearped to
the roof. She layed on her back, hopeing to get alill
raise from the sun. She closed her eye's and her mind
went blank. After about 5 minute's passed, an uneasy
feeling aproched her, she opened her eyes. She saw a
Tall figure in the corner of her eye. Ryoko sat up and
looked at the figure with a black cape, and her face
not even showing.
''Hello Ryoko" the figure said looking off into the
distance towards the lake.
"Do I know you, and what are you doing here?" Ryoko
asked with cuirousity.
"You really dont know me, I came here for you" The
figure said turning her head to Ryoko.
A few moments passed.
"I guess you don't know me" The figure said turning
her head back toward's the lake.
"what are you doing here?"
"is that any of your concern?"
"Look I live here okay, you can't just go showing up
at people house's and...." Ryoko got cut off by a
sharp pain in her back.
"And what?" the Figure said begining to laugh. Then a
Black cloud formed around Ryoko and then it
disapearped leaving no trace at all.
"that was to easy" The Figure said.
"Easy?"
''ugh, what the?" the Figure said turning around and
looking at Ryoko standing behind her.
"I dont like stranger's that make rude appernace's"
Ryoko said kinda grinning then punching the Figure in
the face.
"Ouch, that hurt" the Figure said after  standing up
and takeing a few steps backward and almost fallin of
the roof, than catching  her Balance. Ryoko flew
toarwds her befor she could get good balance and
kicked her in the Stomach. The Figured fell off the
roof and hit the ground hard. Sasami and Aeka heard a
big thumping noise outside. Ryoko began to laugh form
the Figure falling so easyly.

The Stranger just lay on her back with the cape
reveling her face.
'I made a complete fool of my self, that was
embrassing' the stranger thought to her self sitting
up.
"Whats going on?" Sasami asked walking outside from
the Kitchen, then a few moments later Aeka came out.
"who's that?" Aeka asked looking at the Person. The
stranger than brought her hand up to her head and
shock her head, then she stood up. Ryoko teleported to
the ground still laughing alill.
"you think that was funny dont you?" the Stranger
asked looking at Ryoko mad.
"yes I do, for some one falling off the roof"
"Wha.. ugh, we'll see about that" the starnger said
then grining alill and then disapearing.
"who was that Ryoko?" Sasami asked looking at Ryoko.
"I have no Idea Sasami, she just showed up" Ryoko said
looking at Sasami.
"Oh".
"you probley invited her" Aeka said.
"what do you mean by that?" Ryoko asked cirously.
"just what I mean, probley to help you take Tenchi"
"Look princess, I dont need no help takeing Tenchi
away from you anytime, you might need help but
beside's that" Ryoko said placing her hands on her
hips.
"ugh, I never said such a thing"
"I know but how come you have'nt taken him away from
me yet?"
"how come you have'nt taken him away from me?" Aeka
got her on the spot.
"I asked you first" Ryoko said dodging Aeka's
question.
"I'm sick of you and your...your mess of lies Demon"
"First off, thats Demoness need I remind you, and on
the other hand, look who's the one that tell's Tenchi
his true feeling 's for him, and  a person that is to
scared to tell him" Ryoko said kinda grinning.
"WHA... ugh" Aeka said turning a bright red, and
balling her fist. Ryoko began laughing out loud.

**Always nice to see Rey, or is it not?**

"I Totally made a complete fool of myself, UGH, that
Ryoko" The stranger said in her space ship in mid
space, and her looking out the window at all the
star's.
"I take it, that it did'nt go so well Lady Aboshi" A
guy said comeing up behind Aboshi and looking at the
star's that were in front of them. Aboshi glanced at
the guy. The guy was tall in size, and thin. He wore a
Brown color shirt, almost a dark brown, And he wore
black pants. His eye's were a mystical green at the
shape of cat eyes and his hair was a dark brown about
ear length.
"you got that right, you didn't tell me that she can
phase and Teleport?" Aboshi said looking the guy.
"ugh, right, nothing showed up on her profile, thats
why" The guy said with a sweatdrop on the back of his
head, and then rubing the back of his head.
"Fine,"
"would you like me to give it a try?"  the guy asked.
"If you would like, but give it a few days, maybe we
can find any information we missed" Aboshi said
looking back out the window.
"Alright" he guy said. Then turning around he headed
back for the main part of the ship, Head Quater's.

"hey Yikito, get a profile back on Ryoko would you?"
the guy asked coming in the entrance of the Head
Quater's and walking to the monitor screen and looking
at it.
"yes Keion"Yikito said typeing in her computer.
"Hi Kei!!"A Girl said with Red hair put back in a pont
tail and a couple of starins of hair hangin on the
side's, and Violet color eye's. Wearing a space suit
type of thing. With the color's of Blue and green,

behind him and putting her arms around his neck
smileing.
"ugh, Hi Rey" Kei said rolling his eyes and then
sighing.
''Where'd ya go?"
"to go talk to Lady Aboshi" Kei said pressing some
button's on the monitor keyboard.
"Oh, you know, you dont have to call my mom Lady
Aboshi, just say Aboshi,she does'nt mind" Rey said
takeing a step back and looking at the key's that Kei
was pressing.
"well, I'm just used to it"
"oh,you wanna go play light tag?" Rey asked lookin at
Kei and bring'in her arm's around her back and
crossing her fingers.
 "not know, I'll play with ya later"
"I'm bored Kei, please?" Rey said grabing on to Kei's
arm.
"I can't Rey, I'm busy, go get Nikito to go play with
you"
"he can't he left...." Rey said then her eye's wide,
andcovering her mouth from what she just said.
"I mean he left, to go get.... some food" Rey said
rubbing the back of her head. Kei turned around and
looked at Rey.
"we just went out yesterday and got the food, where
did he really go?" Kei asked cirously.
"uh...om...I... can't tell you that" Rey said kinda
nervously.
"Why not?"
"because if I tell you, you'r gonna tell my mom that
he left, and he made me promise not to tell where he
was going"
"look you better tell me, you know you'r mom is gonna
find out where he went by him missing, just tell me
and I wont say a word to you'r mom on to where you'r
brother went"
"if I tell you, you have to promise me somethin"
"what?" Kei asked not wanting to know what the promise
was since Rey really liked him.
"you promise if I tell you that you would play light
tag with me" Rey said smileing.
"ugh, alright I promise" Kei said sighing.
"promise what?" Aboshi said standing in the entrance
way.
"mom, ugh, I told him,..... I would.." Rey said
turning around and looking at her mom, nervously and
being interupted.
"would show me the cheat code's for the Game Energy
Fight, if I promised to play Light tag with her" Kei
said interupting and rubbing the back of his head.
"yeah" Rey said. Yikito kinda smiled.
"oh okey, can one of you two go feed the Druaids?"
Aboshi said then turning around and going down the
hall.
"sure mom" Rey yelled out.
"phew, that was close" Rey said sighing.
"yeah tell me about it"
"dont even think on me showing you those cheat codes
for Energy fight" Rey said smileing and looking at
Kei.

"I knew it, now spit it out" Kei said looking at Rey.
"he went to Neuptune to go see Nia, remeber her?" Rey
asked.
"yeah, why'd he go see her?"
"like duh, he like's her" Rey said with an expression
like "DUH"
"oh, that's why" Kei said kinda dumbfounded. Rey
closed her eye's and shock her head.
"okay come on lets go start playing" Rey said grabing
Kei's arm.
"hang on, Yikito, if you say a word to Aboshi, I swear
you would be so broken you won't be able to talk" Kei
said looking at Yikito.
"alright, you can trust me on that" Yikito said kinda
laughing.
"alright thanks" Kei said.
"come on" Rey said the began running still holding on
to Kei's arm.
"slow down" Kei said trying not to fall on his face
from being pulled.
"sure anytime" Yikito said smileing.
"first we got to go feed the duriads like your mom
said" Kei said still being pulled.
"what?"Rey asked stoping and looking at Kei almost
falling on his face.
"didn't you even hear you'r mom?, she said for one of
us to go feed the Druaids" Kei said looking at Rey.
''oh, well the person in the cell can go feed them"
Rey said then turning around.
"hey, no We can't do that to the prisinor that Aboshi
got last night" Kei said.
"why not?"
"would you like to do it?"
"no, and thats why I'm going to go tell the prisinor
to go do it" Rey said after looking at Kei than
turning back around and heading to the cells. Kei just
shock his head, then decided to follow Rey.

Rey opened the door to the Cell's and walked in and
looked in the 2nd cell.
"hey om, hello wake up" Rey said looking through the
bars at the person in the cell. The Cell area was
kinda dark, but there was at least three lights that
hung on the walls. Kei then walked up beside Rey and
looked at the Person. Anji woke up from the voice of
Rey and kinda glanced at Kei and Rey.
"What?" Anji asked sitting on the ground with her back
up aginist the wall.
"hey you need to go feed the Druaids" Rey said
reaching for the lock to unlock it.
"why can't you do it yourself?" Anji asked not even
moveing.
"what?" Rey asked kinda startled looking at Anji.
"you heard me" Anji said.
"because..."
"Rey just leave her alone, Aboshi said for one of us
to do it not her, if you wont do it, I will" Kei said
looking at Rey.
"but..." Rey said looking at Kei.
"come on" Kei said grabing Rey's arm and pulling her
passed him and away from the lock, and then takeing a
last glance at Anji, and then heading for the Druaids
cage's.

**No Need for New Arrivals**

That next day, Mihoshi and Kiyone had to leave for HQ
hopeing to be back that night, and Noboyuki had to
leave town for work. Tenchi woke up and climbed out of
bed and streched while yawning. Then opening his door
and then walking out into the hallway and closeing the
door behind him.
"Hi Tenchi" Ryoko said phaseing behind him and putting
her arms around his neck.
''ugh... hi Ryoko" Tenchi said kinda nervously.
"you sleep good my Darling?"
"Ryoko get off of me would you please?" Tenchi asked
tryin to get out of Ryoko's grasp.
"But Tenchi......" Ryoko said not letting go of him.
"Ryoko, I should of know'n" Aeka said after walking
off the last step of the stairs and looking at Ryoko
on Tenchi with her arms around his neck.
"well look who finally woke up" Ryoko said looking at
Aeka with her arm's still around Tenchi's neck.
''Get you'r hands off him Ryoko"
''what you gonna do about it Aeka?" Ryoko said
grinning.
"Ugh I mean it Ryoko"
"Well I guess we just have to settle this your way
with you not apercaiting me in anyway" Ryoko said
walking away from Tenchi and kinda standing to the
side and forming her Light staber.
"ladies, let's please not go into any damage here
okay, Sasami has breakfeast" Tenchi said with a
sweatdrop forming on the back of his head and then
looking even more nervous, and getting interupted by
Sasami.
"Breakfeats is Ready!", Sasami Yelled.
"Oh good," Tenchi said kinda in relieif, then sliping
by Ryoko and then by Aeka and hurrying as fast as he
could to the kitchen. Ryoko just staired at him as he
went down the stairs and Aeka did the same. Ryoko's
light staber disapeared.
"We'll settle this later" Aeka said turning to Ryoko.
Ryoko didn't say anything, she just disapeared.

Back at Aboshi's Space Ship named the "Winged Angel",
Kei was in the Head Quater's and looking at the screen
that Yikito was typeing to.
"So, you'r saying that I have to have a Partner for
this?" Kei said turning around and looking at Aboshi.
"yes, thats excatly what I'm saying, you may leave
today if you would like since we found everything that
we need'd in that amount of time." Aboshi said looking
at Kei, and then to a Screen on the side wall. Kei
did'nt say anything, he just wanted to find out the
reason why Aboshi wanted him to have a partner since
he never had one before. Aboshi had Red hair, about a
dark red, that was shoulder legneth. Her eye's were a
Green color, and about 5'7, alill bit shorter than
Kei.
"Once you have a partner, and you have a plan worked
out, I will come in about threee days if you are'nt
already back" Aboshi said. Rey than came in the
entrance and heard the word 'Partner'.
"A partner? I'll be someone's partner!"Rey said
looking at her mother. Aboshi just smiled and shock
her head alill and then turned around and then glanced
at Rey than at Kei.
"you got to ask Kei that" Aboshi said smileing then
turning around and heading out the entrance. Kei got a
look on his face, like' you did not just say that'
"Kei can I be ya Partner for whatever your gonna do,
is it the thingy where you have to go find Ryoko and
bring her back here?" Rey asked looking at Kei
cirously.
"yes Rey it is where I have to find Ryoko and bring
her back here" Kei said turning around and checking
the screen.
"well....can I be your Partner?? PPLLEEAASSEE" Rey
asked walking up to Kei.
"Rey, I dont think so it might be to Dangerous?"
"whats so dangerous about it? Remember about 4 mounths
ago when I went with you to Uranus?, and when our ship
ran out of fuel?, if that is'nt dangerous I dont know
what it" Rey asked while puting her hands on her hips.
"Well..." Kei said remebering when they did hit
Uranus.
"If you let me come, you can leave sooner right?" Rey
said with a grin.
"Yeah,.."
"well?" Rey aaked looking at Kei. It was silent for a
couple of minutes.
"Yes you can come with me" Kei said kinda regreting
it.
"YYEESS, thank you!" Rey said than hugging Kei.
"ugh, sure"
"I'll go get my stuff ready" Rey said then letting go
of Kei and then turning around and running out the
entrance.
"Great, Here I go" Kei said shakeing his head.

"Om, Rey said she would be my partner" Kei said to
Aboshi walking up behind in the Main Area.
"Good, well ya'll two found a time to leave yet?"
Aboshi asked glanceing over at Kei.
"I was just about to go see if she's ready to leave, I
just decided to tell you first" Kei said noticeing
that Aboshi was not acting herself.
"Alright" Aboshi said.
"Om, you alright?, you dont seem like yourself" Kei
asked looking at Aboshi.
"I'm fine" Aboshi said not turning her head.
"Alright, Well I'm gonna go see if Rey is ready" Kei
said then turning around.
"Befor you do that, can you go get some food and take
it to the Prisinor?" Aboshi asked.
"Sure Lady Aboshi" Kei said turning towards Aboshi
then, turning around and walking down the left side of
the hall. Kei walked in to the Kitchin and got some
food, and after about 10 minute's he left the kitchen.
He walked down the hall and headed for the Cell's. Kei
opened the door, and noticed it was more colder than
it was in the main part of the ship. He put the plate
of food on the table in the corner and grabed a
Lanterin and lit it for alill bit more light and left
it on the table in the corner. He picked the plate
back up and walked over the Cell that Anji was in.
"Om, Here's some food, sorry it's so late if being so
on what time you get your food brought to you" Kei
said looking into the dark Cell and seeing the outline
of a shadow. He opend the Cell with this free hand and
opened it all the way. He grabbed a Lanterin off the
wall on the wall of the Cell, and brought it in the
Cell for light. Kei walked forward alill and set the
food down on a stool.  Anji was quietly sitting on the
ground leaned up aginist the wall with her back
aginist it.
"I brought you a drink to,..." Kei said holding the
lanterin in one hand and rubbing the back if his head
with the other. It was quite for a few moments.
"Is it just me or is it cold in here?"Kei said kinda
cold.
"it's not just you, it is cold in here" Anji said.
It was quite for a couple of minutes, he was figureing
out what to say.
"well...... enjoy your food" Kei said befor turning
around and headed out the Cell.
"Oh here, I got this for some more light for you to
see if you need it" Kei said after turning back around
and setting the lanterin on the ground right beside
the stool with her food on it. Kei then turned around
and walked out of the Cell and then he closed the door
and locked it. He took one quick glance and then he
left. Anji lifted her head and looked out towards the
Cell bars, and then looked to the food, and this time
it looked like good food that you can eat.

Kei closed the Cell door behind him and walked up the
hallway and then heard footstep's behind him. He
stoped and turned around. Rey ran to him and hugging
him almost knocking him down.
"Hi Kei, I'm ready, can we go now?" Rey asked hugging
him tightly and  smilieing.
"ugh, yea, lets go tell your mom first that we're
gonna leave" Kei said after getting his blance.
"Okay," Rey said takeing a step back and looking at
Kei. Kei turned around and then started walking.
"So,where are we going excatly?" Rey asked walking
behind Kei looking at her feet as she walked.
"to Okayhama, in Japan" Kei said.
"oh really? cool" Then Kei stoped in front of the
entrance to the HQ and saw no sign of Aboshi.
"where's Lady Aboshi?" Kei asked looking at Yikito.
Yikito was looking at the monitor screen.
"Om, I have no I dea actually, check the Main
entrance" Yikito said looking at Kei and then at Rey.
"Alright thanks" Kei said then began walking,  Rey
followed. When he reached the Main entrance thier was
no Sign of her.
"Do you know where she is?" Kei asked looking around
and then turning to Rey.
"I dont know, but she know's that we were gonna leave
today so lets just go now" Rey said kinda grinning.
"I don't know" Kei said running his fingers thourgh
his hair and looking around one more time.
"OH, come on Kei, lets just go, she won't mind" Rey
said grabing Kei's arm and turning around and then
walking.

Rey walked down the hallway back the HQ.
"hey Yikito, get a ship ready for us, were gonna head
for the ship okay, and if you see my mom, tell her me
and Kei already left okay" Rey said looking at Yikito.
"Alright" Yikito said glanceing at Rey and then
walking over to a really big Keyboard.
"thanks" Rey said smileing then walking to the Walk
out to the ship.
Once Rey and Kei got in the ship and sat in the chairs
a screen poped up.
"okay you two, ya'll ready?" Yikito asked on the
screen.
"Yep I am" Rey said smileing and getting straped in
the seat. Once Kei got down straping himself in he
looked at the Screen.
"Yea I'm ready" he said.
"alright, I'm setting the course for Okayhama Japan,
right?" Yikito said looking down at the keyborad below
her.
"Yep" Rey said.
A few moments passed.
"alright have fun, and ya'll are off" Yikito said
looking back up at the screen.
"alright Bye" Rey said waveing.
"bye" Yikito said waveing back and smileing.
"bye" Kei said right befor the screen disapeared and
then the Ship started itself. A screen poped up agina
reading. 'Course set for Japan, Okayhama, now
leaving'. The the screen dispeared and then the door
to the Ship release section opened and then the ship
lifted in the Air and Took off.

** The landing**

Ryoko was laying on her back on top of the roof. It
was just about 11:45. Sasami was cleaning up the house
some, Tenchi was working in the feild, and Aeka
helping Sasami. Kiyone and Mihoshi were still at HQ.
And Washuu was in her usall spot in her lab, on her
seat, typeing like she usally does. Ryoko than yawned
from being bored. Ryoko than closed her eys's and just
layed there.

"Kei are we there yet?" Rey asked glanceing at Kei.
"No," Kei said. Then a scren poped up and it gave how
much time they had left untill they reached there
reaching point on earth.
   "0.30.17" it all the screen read.
"Okay, I guess we have thrity minutes left" Rey said
than sighing a long sigh. A few moments passed.
"hey Rey, omm, whats been wrong eiyh your mom, I
noticed thats she has'nt been acting her self lately?"
Kei asked looking over at Rey.
"om... its because my Father's comeing home, he should
be home today" Rey said kinda glanceing at Kei.
"your dad?, you told me that he left ya'll along time
ago" Kei asked cuirosly.
"Well, that was a lie" Rey said.
"than your real father didnt leave ya'll?"
"right"
"than who's your real father?"
"Shitaka"
"SHITAKA IS YOU'R FATHER?" Kei asked wide eyed.
"yes"
"woh" Kei said than shakeing his head.
"why'd ya lie to me?, does Yikito know about this?"
"Yea she knows, she knows the whole story"
"but why'd ya'll lie to me than?"
"I'll tell you this, After what happened my mom wanted
my Father to leave, but he didn't leave. My mom told
us to just treat him like if her were a stranger and
maybe that way he would leave, I had no problem with
it, but my brother really didn't like what was gonna
happen, he was close to my dad. Once we had began
ignoring him sometimes, he would just droop the
subject and leave, My mom even threatned him if he
did'nt leave, that did'nt do no good"
"Oh I take it what ever he did, ya'll didnt like"
"you can say that agina". It was than quite for a few
minutes.

"but why'd ya'll lie to me?"
"when we first meet you, we really did'nt know who you
were, maybe undercover or something, we just wanted
this problem to be between us, and no one else, so
that's why we never told you the truth"
"Okay".
"If you don't mind me asking, what did Shitaka do to
ya'll for ya'll to not like him as you do now?"
"If you promise not to tell my mom that I'm telling
you this I'll tell you"
"You know me, I promise" Kei said glanceing at Rey.
"To make a Long Story short, about 4 years ago,
Shitaka was more... careing than he is now. He wanted
my mom to stop being a Bounty hunter because he did
not want her to get hurt, but she had already been a
Bounty hunter a year befor she meet him, and she liked
it. when she told him no, he got mad, because he
wanted her, me and my brother to do what he wanted us
to do. He got really mad and he said if we tryed to
leave we would regret it, believe me, we tryed to
leave twice, and we'll neve try it agina. Ever since
than he has been more mean everytime he came back,
escpecailly to my mom. He never was that mean to my
Brother since him and my father were really close
together." It was quite for a couple of Minutes.

"So every once in a while he leave's and he comes?"
"yea, we tryed to leave when he was gone, but he
always found us about 3 or 2 days later, and he would
take it out on my mom really bad, and which me and
brother were the one's that talked her into it the
first time, he got really mad than."
"Sorry to hear about it, cant you'r mom get it through
his thick head that ya'll dont want to stay with him"
Kei asked looking Rey.
"she tryed and tryed, but he never got it through his
stupid thick head" Kei looked forward and thought for
a moment.
"It's like a nightmare coming and going, and you tell
it to go away but it alway's comes back, thats what my
mom told me when we were talkin yesterday. She hates
Shitaka from the things from the past"
"you mean he did more stuff?" Kei asked turning to Rey
concerned. Rey nodded her head. A screen than poped up
and it gave how much time they have left.
      "0.14.48"
"was it serious?" Kei asked kinda turning his head to
the front window and seeing a view of Earth in front
of them.
"yea it was" Rey said kinda quitely.

The pasted 5 minute's it was quite. Kei was clearing
out his thoughts.
'I never would of thought that Shitaka would be their
father and Aboshi's husband, but I can understand
where thier coming form, where I was a new comer about
2 years ago and than them not really knowing who I
was, saying that Shitaka was just a life time friend,
and that thier real father left them about 5 years
ago' Kei thought to himself. The last 10 minutes
passed by quickly.

  "0.3.25" it what the timer had said just a moment
ago.
"well here we go" Kei said glanceing at Rey.
"yep" Rey said kinda smileing.

Washuu was in her lab typeing as she could to get some
information down on her computer. Than all of a sudden
a screen poped up showing a huge load of energy showed
up on her computer.
"What the?"Washuu said looking confused looking at the
Energy that displayed on her screen.
"where could that of come from?" She asked clicking
some button's and than the screen disapeared. Washuu
arched an eyebrow looked at the screen for a minute
and then went bak to what she was doing."you alright
Rey?" Kei asked in the seat looking at the engine that
was smokeing and the trees that were in front of them
that were all knocked down from the crash.
"yea, I'm fine" Rey said looking around at the
surrounding's. Than the inside at the cockpit began to
smoke inside.
  "Caution" is what a screen read as it poped up.
"I think we ought to get out of this ship Rey" Kei
said unstraping himself from the seat and standing up
and kinda wobbling over a lill bit and than catching
his balance.
"yea good Idea" Rey said than doing the same and than
standing up. Kei headed towards the door, and pushed
down the knob but it would'nt budge.
"great" Kei said. Then takeing a step backwards, he
kicked the door open.
"Nice kick" Rey said looking at the door swing open.
"thanks" Kei said than stepping out of the ship and
that walking up alill and looking around. Rey
followed.
"so...is this the spot where were supposed to find
Ryoko?" Rey asked.
"I have no Idea, but we need a plan"
"a plan?"
"yea DUH, if we find Ryoko she'll probley be cirous
and ask what happened, so we say our ship crashed,
does it look like we were in a crash?" Kei asked with
a look like "get a grip"
"no it does'nt look like we were in a crash, what do
you suppose we do? beat each other up? to where it
does look like we were in a crash?" Rey asked crossing
her arms on her chest.
"that's a good idea," Kei said.
"no, I'm not about to let myself get beat up" Rey said
turning to the side.
"what do you suppose we do than?, let an wild animal
attack us than?" Kei asked.
"no"
"well whats better? either getting attacked by an wild
animal and maybe getting killed or beating each other
up where it wont be that serious?" Kei asked crossing
his arms. Rey glanced at Kei, and than looked to the
ground.
"I guess thats the only choice, but what if she ask's
why we came here"
"she does'nt have to know"
"Kei, she will be cirous REMEBER" Rey said yelling.
"Okay, dont yell, I'll think of something" Kei said
bringing his hands out in front of him, hopeing she
won't yell anymore.
"okay, but I still dont want to get beat up just to
say we were in a plane crash"
"Oh come on, what are you gonna do cry about gettin
beat up?" Kei asked.
'Ha, if this wont work, I dont now what will' Kei
thought to himself.
"me cry? I just dont want everyone to now, that I got
beat up thats all"
"who's gonna now?, come on, WWAAHH" Kei said kinda
grinning. Rey arched an eyebrow.
"WWAAHH" Kei said takeing a step backwards. Rey than
got a serious look on her face. She brought her hands
down. Kei's face strightened, than went back to
grining.
"WWAAHH"Kei said. Rey balled her hand in a fist and
brought it up and hit Kei in the face.
"Oww, that hurt" Kei said takeing a step back and
holding his hand over left eye.
"dont make fun if me like that" Rey said with her fist
still in a ball.
"well I had to do somethin for us to start fighting
did'nt I?" Kei asked looking at Rey.
"oh, that was the plan to make fun of me for me to hit
you and than that would be the first thing right?"
"well,..... yea".
"UGH'' Rey said whileing swinging her fist. Kei ducked
and than kicked Rey in the stomach and she backed up
alill bit.
"I now I can't hit girl's, but in this situation, it
does'nt matter". Kei said proudly. Than Rey gave him a
blow to his stomach.
"you hit and kick hard for a girl" Kei said holding
his stomach from the blow of a kick.
"Thanks, I've been Practiceing." Rey said smileing.
Rey than Kicke her foot up near Kei's face, Kie moved
backwards in time befor he got hit in the fave with
the 'foot'. He than slaped her.
"Hehe" Kei said grinning alill.
"oh I see you wanna play the slapping game right?''
Rey said than Slapping Kei back. Kei kinda grined from
finding out her kick and punch is worse than her slap.
Kei than doubled smacked Rey.

"you really annoy me sometimes you now that" Rey said
than throwing a punch and missing.
"Thats good to now, you get on my nerves sometimes
also" Kei said than throwing a punch and hitting Rey
in the nose.
"OOWW, thats my nose thank you"Rey said takeing a
couple of steps back.
