Chapter 1

	The morning sun shined on Mihoshi's closed eyes,
causing them to open.  "Wha..." she mumbled as she found
herself lying in a bed lying next to a large window.  The
room was well maintained and lying in a bed lying kept
clean.  `Wow!' thought Mihoshi.  She looked down to make
sure she still had her clothes on... *whew* at least that
was good.

	The young blonde climbed out of her futon and slowly
walked toward the door, when she stopped at the sight of
the door beginning to slide open. "Oh! I see you're awake.
Sorry if I scared you." said Sabi, who had some oil on his
right cheek.  Mihoshi began to giggle at him.  "What's so
funny?" "You have oil on your face" she exclaimed.  "Oh,
that! I finally fixed my motorcycle this morning," said
Sabi with a smile on his face.
"Are you feeling better after what happened last night?
What's a beautiful girl like you doing at a time like
that?" "I'm fine. I was shopping for clothes for myself
and food for Sasami." exclaimed Mihoshi. "Well... your
folks must be worried sick about you.  You can have
breakfast here if you like.  It's already on the table,
nice and hot.  After that I`ll take you home." Sabi cried
out as he walked down the hall.

	"Any luck, Ryoko?" asked Tenchi, who was starting
to become a nervous wreck. The space pirate sadly shook
her head, "No sign of her.  And she added so much humor
to our lives."  Tenchi and the others had stayed up all
night searching for Mihoshi.  Ayeka went up to him and
attempted to calm him down.  "Don't worry, Lord Tenchi,
we'll do all we can to find Mihoshi, even if it takes us
a hundred days to find her."  "Thank you, Ayeka... all
of you."  said Tenchi.  Ryo-Ohki climbed onto the sofa
Tenchi was sitting on and gave him a sweet and gentle
hug.  "Mya" she cooed.  "I knew I shouldn't have let her
go shopping.  It's my entire fault."  "It's not your
fault, Tenchi," spoke Sasami. with tears in her eyes.
"It's nobody's fault."

************************************************************

	"You ready to go home, Mihoshi?......Mihoshi?"
shouted Sabi.  *SLAM*  "owwwwww"  uttered Mihoshi, who
had slipped on the floor.  "Are you okay?" "Mm-hmm"
muttered the ditz, as she got up onto her feet.

Later on in the Day...

Sabi and Mihoshi arrive at the front gate of the
Masaki residence.  Sabi recognizes the house on
sight.  He turns to Mihoshi, "Are you sure we are
at the right address?!?"  "Of course.  Why?"  asked
Mihoshi.  Sabi slapped his hand across his forehead.
"Because this is where Tenchi Masaki lives!!!" "I know
that.  I live here too." She happily replied. `Tenchi's
engaged?!? Boy is he a lucky son of a bitch!' thought
Sabi.  "Sabi?... Sabi" Mihoshi asked, waving her hand
in front of his face. "Huh?"  "Are you okay?" she said,
sounding a little concerned. "I'm fine."  "Um... would
you like to come inside for some tea and lunch.  Sasami
makes the best food." said Mihoshi with a smile on her
face.  "Sure, why not?" replied with a weird look on his
face.

************************************************************

	Outside the house, Ryo-Ohki was busy chasing Sasami
around.  The cabbit suddenly noticed something out of the
corner of her eye.  "Mya?" she turned around to see Mihoshi
and Sabi walking up the pathway. "What is it Ryo-Ohki... oh
my gosh!!!!!   TENCHI!!!" Sasami yelled, running toward the
house.  The front door slammed open.  "What's wrong 
Sasami?.......Mihoshi?...MIHOSHI!!!" Tenchi cried out.
"Huh? Sabi? Is that you also?"  he said.  "Tenchi, how's
it hangin!"  "Mihoshi, we were worried sick about you!"
Sabi shrugged "I guess I was right.  They were worried
sick about you." *SMACK* "OW! Mihoshi, what was that
for?!?"  Mihoshi gave him a mean look, one that shut Sabi
up.

Chapter 2

Location: Galaxy Police Headquarters Penitentiary.
Planet:  Gamma Omaan

	All seemed under control at the prison.  *BLAM*
"*SECURITY BREACH, SECURITY BREACH!!! PRISONER ESCAPING.
I REPEAT, PRISONER ESCAPING!!!  ALL FORCES TO BLOCK 14L IMMEDIATELY!!!"  
"Right on cue.  And they call themselves
Galaxy Police Officers!  More like fools on a wild goose
chase!" said an unknown figure running down a large
corridor.  "Kunai!!!" the figure charged out.  Within
seconds, an enormous ship appeared over the escapee and
fired a light on the figure, instantly teleporting him
onto the gigantic vessel.  The spacecraft then proceeded
to fire its engines, sending it and it's occupant straight
into space.

	The warden of the prison saw what had just happened
from his desk in a large room at the prison.  He sat
down in his desk and pressed a button at the right corner
next to a stack of books.  A monitor appeared in font of
him.  The screen flickered on, and a man with long, blonde
hair came into view.  "This is Marshal Anderson of the
Galaxy Police.  What is the emergency, warden?"  The
warden spoke with intense anxiety as he saluted the
Marshal. "Sir,  we have just had a breakout from the
prison.  According to our records, the A1 class criminal,
Sumakka, has completely eluded forces here on Gamma Omaan.
We have officers in hot pursuit of him.  But we fear that
our forces alone will be unable to recapture him."  Marshal
Anderson remained calm, "I will send our best forces out to
assist you in the chase, warden.  Have you any suspicions as
to were he is heading?"  "Only two locations can be the only
place Sumakka would head for.  Either planet Jurai, or... the
planet Earth."  the warden swiftly answered.  The Marshal
paused for a moment, then said, "Thank you for informing me
about this.  We will take the case from here.  If you turn
up any more news regarding this incident, do not hesitate
to call me." "Sir, with all due respect, if I were you, I
would inform the planet Jurai about this breakout immediately."
said the warden with a calm tone.  "That is exactly what I
intend to. This is Marshal Anderson, out." those were the
final words spoken before the monitor went blank.  He
collapsed into his chair with a sigh.
