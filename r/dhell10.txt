DARKEST HELL : CHAPTER 10 - FAMILY TIES

	The darkness was absolute.  No light.  No sound. 
Well, almost no sound.  Off in the unthinkable
distances there is a scream, a long shrill scream off
utter hopelessness, torture, and suffering.  The
screamer's voice is beginning to become hoarse.  But,
in this screamer's mind, she knows that no one is
listening, at least no one who cares.  The young
prisoner is unshackled, unrestrained.  There is no
need, for she knows that the darkness goes on forever,
and ever.  Before her, the darkness flows, like blood. 
There is no one here, there is nowhere to go, but she
still screams.  She screams because she holds on to the
last thing her traumatized mind can still grasp, hope. 
A blind hope that somewhere, someone was listening,
someone who understood, someone who would help.  She
knew someone was there with her, someone evil, the man
who brought her there.  Zeb.  The vile bastard who
tricked her, faked being her friend and brought her, to
this dark nightmare land.  Her mind was on the brink,
barely able to take any more of this torture.   Where
was Tsunami when she needed her?  Why hasn't she taken
her out of this hell?  Why must she endure this alone? 
There are too many questions, and not enough answers. 
'Is this part of the hell that I must endure, the
confusion, the endless mental loops?  WHY!?'  the young
girls injured mind pondered.  She kept thinking this to
herself as the darkness flowed some more, closing in on
her.  'It's coming again…' she thought as the darkness
smothered her again.  Then suddenly, the screaming
stopped…

*******************************************************

	"When are you going to FINISH!?"  Asked Ayeka
impatiently to the Red headed wonder, Washu.  

	"I'm still scanning.  As soon as I isolate the
section of the brain that the demonic influence resides
in, I will proceed…with… the… evacuation."  Washu
informed the ticked off princess as she carefully
scanned  several areas of Tenchi's brain.  Tenchi still
lay in stasis on Ryo-oki.  Ryoko, Ayeka and the rest of
the occupants on the ship stared at the intense, nerve
racking procedure.  Even Keiko, who had woken up an
hour ago.  Yosho needed to hold her up, for she was
still weak, but at least she is alive.  The tension was
finally broken, after a few long hours.

	"FOUND IT! HAHAHAHAHA!"  Washu cheered as a small,
almost microscopic portion of Tenchi's brain glowed and
blinked.  She summoned her phantom laptop and typed
furiously.  A small holographic projection of several
charts popped up as several wrinkles in the holographic
projection of Tenchi's brain slowly were filled with a
red, glowing light.  The light eventually made it's way
to the blinking spot.  Then the charts went haywire. 
Various energy levels flowed up and down and readings
were taken and recorded for future research.  Washu
smiled as the blinking dot slowly faded away.  Still
smiling, Washu gazed up at the rest of the group. 
Ryoko saw this smile and immediately knew what it
meant.  She smiled brightly as Washu pressed a few more
buttons and the stasis field around Tenchi faded into
nothing.  Gasps of shock echoed through Ryo-oki as
Tenchi's hand rose into the air.  And this time, Ryoko
was the first one there.  She nearly killed Tenchi with
her crushing hug.  She separated from him when he began
to turn purple.  She giggled, but was violently pushed
away by Ayeka, who gave Tenchi a hug, followed by
everyone else.  Finally, Washu managed to push the
hoard away from the poor, weakened boy.

	"Give him some room!  Let him breath!"  Washu
yelled at the weeping mob.  Reluctantly, they obeyed. 
They all backed a good distance away and watched as
Washu helped Tenchi sit up.  Ryoko was so overjoyed,
she couldn't contain herself.  Managing not to run at a
breakneck speed, Ryoko walked over to the recuperating
Tenchi.  She went to his side and kneeled down, lightly
holding his hand.  Slowly, Tenchi turned his head, and
smiled.  The tears flowed freely down Ryoko's cheek and
reached up.  She caressed Tenchi's face and then gave
him another hug.  But this one didn't suffocate him. 
Soon, Ayeka joined, then followed by Nobiyuki.  Washu
just rolled her eyes.

	"They NEVER listen to me…"  Washu muttered.  She
just sighed, gave a shrug, and joined in with this
Kodak moment. 

*******************************************************

	Gillian just hugged on Matsui, as she had for the
last few hours.  He hasn't moved, he hasn't blinked,
and he barely even breathes.  But the strangest thing
of all is the fact that his lips have gone from their
normal color to a pale blue.  She thought him dead on
several occasions, but his breathing convinced her
otherwise.  She rocked him back and forth, lightly
kissing him, praying and crying for him to wake up, to
be alright, but her prayers have yet to be answered. 
Togusa has been watching her do this ever since she
brought him back on board.  He remained quiet and flew
the damn ship, not wishing to get involved.  He knew
what Gillian was capable of, especially when it came to
those she loved, and didn't wish to do or say anything
that'll piss her off.  She has the tendency to
overreact to certain things.  He looked over on the
other side of the ship and saw Kiyonne and Mihoshi. 
Mihoshi stood, looking out into the vastness of space
while Kiyonne, well, she looked like she could use some
rest.  'Hell, we all could.  That seems to be the ONLY
thing that hasn't happened yet.  Came close on Orion,
but that didn't go very well…' Togusa thought to
himself.  He let out a sigh and continued to watch
Ryo-oki in the monitor.  He could sense that something
was going on, but he couldn't guess at what.  He looked
at Gillian and Matsui again.  She still rocked back and
forth, near catatonic.  He grunted in a small amount of
anger and then the occupants of the ship felt the
G-forces shift as Leo-oki made its way to even out with
Ryo-oki.  Then he got out of his seat.  Gillian barely
gasped as Togusa picked both of them up and faded into
the air.  Mihoshi turned around a second later, her
eyes blinking with confusion. 

*******************************************************

	Washu was almost too busy relishing the moment to
notice the energy discharge.  She opened her lime green
eyes and looked over to her left.  Standing there was
Togusa.  In his arms was his brother, and behind him
stood Gillian, gazing the seemingly unconscious figure
and weeping.  She saw that Gillian was pale and
shivering, and was probably going into shock.

	"Awe, man.  Now what…?"  Washu mumbled almost
inaudibly as she broke her embrace with the newly
revived Tenchi and walked over to the fallen young man. 
Then she saw his pale, blue lips.  Washu's eyes widened
and her breath became ragged as the memories came back
to her.  Of how the demon had tempted her, then tricked
her.  She remembered the seemingly eternal torture that
she was forced to undertake.  And now, here it was
again.  Before her stood Togusa, the young man's once
wild green eyes now pleading to her, as if to tell her
'Help him…'.  She ran over to Togusa and took Matsui
from him.  His clothes were torn and tattered, and
certain areas were burnt and crispy, and he was missing
his right arm.  It was a strange sight to see such a
small person as Washu pick up and hold a man as big as
her without any form of physical strain.  But she did,
and put him on Keiko's old medical table.  Immediately
the scanners came on and scanned him.

	"What are you doing?"  Togusa asked Washu, his
voice sullen and downhearted.

	"I'm scanning him…"  Washu began.

	"Scanning?!  All you DO is scan!  DO SOMETHING
WORTH A DAMN FOR A CHANGE!"  Togusa interrupted.  His
shouting caused the others to break away from Tenchi
and wonder what was going on.  Ryoko watched as Gillian
lumbered over to Matsui's unconscious body.  She
watched as Gillian broke down again.  'This isn't
right…'  Ryoko thought as she looked at Tenchi, who was
half asleep from the exhaustion.  Ryoko gently laid
Tenchi down on the table as he dozed off, and walked
over to Gillian.  The smell of sadness crept over her
like a fog, almost causing Ryoko to waver.  But she
continued and put her arm around the poor thing. 
Gillian then turned and gave her a crushing hug and
began to cry, and hard.  Ryoko stood there and consoled
her, patting her on the back and whispering encouraging
things in her ears.  She looked over at Washu, who
seemed completely immersed in the information that the
scan provided.  But it wasn't a look of happiness that
she had, but one of pure shock and dismay.  Holding
Gillian up, Ryoko slowly walked over to the small
scientist.  Curiously, Ryoko began to gaze at the
information.  It blazed by at a rate too fast for Ryoko
to comprehend, but Washu understood it all, and was not
happy.  

	"Wh…what is it, mom?"  Ryoko asked, seriously.

	"I'm seeing it… but I don't believe it…"  Washu
mumbled, still shocked.

	"What?  What is it?"  Ryoko continued.

	"It's his DNA… it's pattern.  I'm seeing it, but…
I can't even explain!"  Washu continued to mumble,
barely heard by the group.

	"Well… Tell us, Damn it!  What do you see?" 
Togusa asked.

	"I have no idea…"  Washu said as she shook her
head and looked at the screen again.

	"NO IDEA!?"  Togusa shouted, causing everyone but
Gillian, Ryoko and Washu to jump back.  He was turning
red with anger, almost as red as his hair.  He looked
at Washu with is emerald eyes, their rims red with
anger.  

	"His DNA is beyond all my comprehension!  It's a
work of art!."  Washu muttered.

	"Art?"  Ryoko asked.

	"Yes.  His DNA chain is to complex, even for MY
understanding.  I am amazed at what I'm looking at…" 
Washu said, unblinking.

	"Well, I'm happy that you are astounded by the
complexities of Matsui's DNA, but what about Matsui
himself, will he be okay?"  asked Ayeka from behind,
somewhere.

	"Well, as long as he remains comatose, yes.   " 
Washu answered.

	"And that's supposed to mean…?"  Funaho replied.  

	"Well, to keep it simple, if the demons are able
to control him, I can see an unfortunate situation. 
But, if he remains in a coma until I can invent
something to cure him, he'll be fine."  

	"What about the device you used on Tenchi?" 
Togusa asked.

	"I'm afraid that Matsui is too complex for his own
good.  My machine won't work."

	"How long will it take?"  Takeshi asked.

	"I don't know, hours, days, months…"

	"Well, we don't HAVE months, you might want to get
to work…" Ryoko commented.

	"Yes, I know, but I'm going to need privacy. 
Togusa, I was wondering if I could use Leo-oki…"

	"Sure, on three conditions."  Togusa responded.

	"Name them." Washu said, her voice serious.

	"One, you don't blow anything up."  Togusa said,
extending his index finger.

	"What do I LOOK like, a mad scientist?" Washu
asked.

	"Yes" Everyone said in unison.  Washu frowned
deeply.

	"Two, me and Gillian stay on the ship with you."
Togusa continued.

	"Fine." Washu sighed.

	"And three, you have to go into your adult form
and stay that way, at least for a while.  I much prefer
to see you like that."  Togusa winked.

	"You pig.  Alright, fine.  Anything to help
Matsui."  Washu said as she snapped her fingers,
reverting to her adult form.  Togusa smiled and then
snapped HIS fingers.  Gillian, Togusa, and Washu
vanished into thin air and Kiyonne and Mihoshi fell
from the sky with a dull thud.   

	"Uh, Kiyonne, where are we?" Mihoshi asked.

	"I guess where on Ryo-oki now…" Kiyonne guessed as
she looked around at all the dumbfounded faces. 

*******************************************************

	The first thing Tenchi saw when he awoke was
Ryoko's face nuzzling his neck.  Her arm was draped
over him and she seemed to be asleep.  Somewhere in the
distance, Tenchi saw several mats formed out of
Ryo-oki's floor.  Sleeping on them were everyone that
he has grown to know and love over the long stretches
of time.  The only person awake was a man, who stood
watch over Tenchi like a hawk.  His face, although
blurry and slightly hidden in the dark, was very
familiar.

	"Grandpa…" Tenchi whispered weakly.

	"Yes Tenchi.  I am here."  Yosho answered.

	"You're… so young…how?" Tenchi murmured softly.

	"Never mind that..."  Yosho told his weakened
grandson. 

	"Well, it looks good on you.  So, what happened
while I was out?"  Tenchi questioned as he began to sit
up.  Ryoko murmured and slightly moved when he did
this.  Tenchi froze and laid back down, not wishing to
wake her up.  

	"You mean you do not know?"  Yosho asked, totally
surprised.

	"The last thing I remember is the fire.  Is the
house alright?  Why are we in Ryo-oki?"

	"Tenchi, I have some… bad tidings… to inform you
of."  

	"Tell me, grandpa, I can take it."  Tenchi said
bravely.  Yosho then began to inform him on the story
thus far, of the destruction of both Earth and Jurai,
Gillian, Togusa, and Matsui, of Keiko and Takeshi, and
all the rest.  Tenchi looked as if he was going to have
a coronary.

	"WHAT!?" Tenchi yelped at the top of his lungs,
succeeding in waking the slumbering Ryoko up.  She
rubbed her eyes and smile weakly at Tenchi.  The look
in Tenchi's eyes and the way he hyperventilated swiped
the smile from her face.  Then she saw Yosho, and took
a guess at what Tenchi had just learned.  

	"What about Mayuka?  What about my aunt and Taro? 
WHAT ABOUT ALL MY FRIENDS!?  WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM!? 
TELL ME!"  Tenchi demanded loudly, causing Ayeka to
stir.

	"We… can only assume the worst…" Yosho said,
looking away.  Tenchi's whole world collapsed around
him.  The universe faded away and the only things that
existed were rage and sadness.  The expression on his
face became both full of wrath, and swollen with
depression.  

	"And, then of course, there was the fact that you…
died…" Ryoko added.  Tenchi looked at her. His eyes
grew even more saddened.  

	"I… died?"  Tenchi gulped.

	"Yes.  The Dark Juraians took your body and made
you their demon warrior."  Ayeka added as she walked up
to the table where Tenchi and Ryoko lay.

	"Demon warrior… you mean the one that destroyed
Jurai!?"  Tenchi exclaimed as his voice cracked.

	"Yes…"  Ayeka added, sadly.  Then Ayeka watched as
Tenchi blacked out and fell back onto the table with a
thump.  Ryoko sighed depressingly and caressed his
face.  She felt the tears falling down her face.  'No. 
No more tears.  I've cried too much.  I have to be
strong… for Tenchi.' Ryoko thought as she wiped away
the tears.  'Poor Tenchi.  So much trauma all at once. 
He doesn't deserve all of this…' Ayeka thought as she
lowered herself onto the floor next to Tenchi, which
immediately became soft, and rose to form another mat. 
Soon, as Ryoko and Tenchi were, she fell asleep.  Yosho
soon followed.  Somewhere, in the back of Ryoko's head,
as she drifted off into a dreamless slumber, she heard
a voice, a laugh, more hideous and dark than that she
has ever heard before.  And she heard it for hours,
even as she slept, as did Ayeka, Nobuyuki, Washu,
Tenchi, and, to a lesser extent, Gillian.  But the
laughter was even louder for one of the fairly large
group.  But, it was intermixed with all sorts of
voices, calling out for blood, vengeance, and honor. 
The person kept playing the events back and forth in
his mind that led to this loud, hellish chorus. 
'Welcome to eternity' said one of the voice in a
dialect he didn't recognize, but understood
immediately.  He remembered sobbing in the park near
the hotel.  He remembered monitoring strange energy
spikes in the three bright stars surrounding the
planet.  He remembered flying into one of the stars to
get a more accurate reading, and seeing the black,
amorphous mass, growing in the center.  Then, he saw
Gillian, and how perversely she was being raped by
Tenchi, Yosho, Nobuyuki, and his brother.  Rage filled
him as the blackness surrounded him, and soon, all was
dark.  And still he saw the images.  He heard Gillian's
cries of pain and embarrassment.  He felt for her, but
could do nothing more.  Rage filled his soul.  Rage at
the fact that this was being done to the one he so
loved, by the ones he had trusted.  How could they do
this, especially his brother, who he trusted more than
anyone in the universe.  He had touched his Gillian. 
He had raped his Gillian, over and over, his mouth
flowing with her blood, his eyes glowing bright red. 
Finally, the rage inside him transformed.  It became
something dark, evil and sinister.  Inside his
encapsulated, metallic prison ( Washu had covered the
table with a laser field, just in case…), Matsui's eyes
opened, but the wide eyed greenness was no longer
there.  His eyes were as black as Leo-oki's now, and
filled with rage.  He bared his small fangs, one of the
few traits given to him from his mother, and suddenly,
a small red light penetrated the deep blackness in his
feral eyes…

*******************************************************

	'Why… why must this go on and on… I cannot live
through too much more of this… please… mother… save
me…' thought Sasami.  In the eternal volume of the
blackness, she is nothing.  No light penetrates the
darkness, no new hope either.  She reaches out with her
awareness from time to time, and manages to touch the
mind of another, but he is cold and not listening to
her pleas for mercy.  But Sasami kept on trying, hoping
that someone, somewhere, was listening…

*******************************************************

	"Very good Zeb.  You have served me well.  You
have brought me a goddess, and that is not very easy,
especially for a mortal such as yourself.  I commend
you.  Now leave me, I must talk with my advisor."  Said
a dark voice from the shadows.  His face was shrouded
by the darkness, and only his body can be seen.  His
heavily muscular form was covered in a vile
misinterpretation of the uniform of the emperor of
Jurai.  Zeb, totally pleased with himself, faded back
into the darkness.  Soon after, a creature, wearing a
death robe, walked up to the Dark Emperor.  His large,
evil bat wings fluttered and stretched in the large
room.  The robed creature knelt before the emperor.

	"What shall we do with the mortal?"  The Emperor
asked him, his voice laced with evil.

	"It has been our policy to never except neophytes
into our empire.  I suggest we keep that policy, and do
just as we did with the other human and send him on a
suicide mission.  They have both served their purpose,
and should be exterminated."  The robed creature
hissed.  In the darkness around his face, the dark
emperor's eyes glowed a bright red.  At first, the
emperor merely chuckled, but then it grew into a full
fledged roar.  But the laughter did not fall on the
robed creature's ears alone.  There was another in the
room, one who never left.  'Keep your friends close,
and your enemies even closer…' thought the trespasser
to himself.  'If they want the goddess, they will have
to come and get her.'  He continued when he teleported
out of the chamber.  The robed creature felt something
in the back of his spine, something that bothered him.  

	"Something is amiss, my liege.  I foresee
disaster."  The creature muttered to his master, who
had stopped laughing.  

	"Then make it so you foresee my VICTORY!"  The
Emperor yelled.  He held out his armored hand and
suddenly, the area around the robed creature became
distorted.  Soon, the creature was blown back hundreds
of feet from the massive throne room.  He began to
groan in severe pain.

	"Yes… my liege… I… will not… fail you…" He
muttered.

	"Make sure that you don't, otherwise, I will not
be so merciful."  The dark emperor growled as he waved
the creature off.  The Robed beast simply faded into
the ever expanding blackness.  

*******************************************************

	Sasami just laid there, alone, naked, fearful. 
She knew that something was different about her, but
she couldn't sense it.  There was no light, so she was
blind, and she was totally numb, so she couldn't feel a
thing, physically.  Unexpectedly, the blackness around
her shifted.  She felt the presence of another, coming
ever closer.  She knew it wasn't her mother, or her
father, or even Ayeka.  'Tenchi?' she thought, but no,
she dismissed that thought, cause he was dead, killed
by her captors.  The presence became stronger as it
neared, and Sasami felt its blackness, its evil.  She
tried to scream, but her throat was beyond making any
noise.  The fear began to make her breath heavily
again.  'No… no more… please…' was all she thought as
she felt herself being hoisted over someone's shoulder. 
Her numb, limp body just swing over like a large rag
doll.  Then, a second later, she felt her stomach lurch
and she was surrounded by blinding light.  The minutes
flew by like seconds as she felt herself being jerked
and hoisted around, and then her captor, or rescuer,
began to run.  She felt him limping harshly and his
breathing was ragged.  Then, the lurching began again. 
But this time, she the bright light was replaced by a
blurry image of stars and nebulas.  Soon after, the
"Pins and needles" came and she began to feel sensation
in her body.  Taking this opportunity, she looked at
herself.  Her hair was ragged and tangled.  She was
bruised all over, from her long, slender neck, all the
way to her breasts.  Breasts?  She looked at herself
more and saw that she was no longer the young Sasami
that everyone had known.  She was older now.  She was
Tsunami.  She was now the living embodiment of a
goddess.  She had grown while she lived in the
darkness.  Was she there THAT long?  She subconsciously
shook her head.  'I hope everyone is alright…' she
thought as she slowly twisted herself off of the
shoulder of her weakened rescuer.  She realized that
they were not moving, for he had gone unconscious. 
Tsunami looked at the persons face.  'That face…'
Tsunami thought.  Its familiarity finally jogged her
memory.  Those beady eyes, that short, dark green hair,
his gangly form… it was Zeb, the man who brought her to
that hell.  Images of her ripping apart the little man
flooded Tsunami's head, when she realized something as
she saw the blood flowing freely from his gnashed open
chest.  'Why did he save me?' she thought.  'He risked
everything to save my life… I must help him…' 
Tsunami's mind rang.  With a wave of her hand, Tsunami
clothed herself and grabbed up the knocked out young
man.  She frowned when the wounds would not close. 
Then, using her mind, Tsunami felt out into space for
any familiar thought echoes.  She found them all, in
the same place.  Smiling, she faded into the blackness
of space…

*******************************************************

	"Whaa…?" mumbled Tenchi when he heard a loud
thump.  He rose up, and gently moved Ryoko's head off
of his chest.  'Poor Ryoko… she's been through too
much…' Tenchi thought to himself.  Then he realized
that the same could be said about everyone in this
ship.  Slowly, so he didn't wake up Ryoko, Tenchi got
up and moved through the inside of Ryo-oki, toward the
source of the thump.  Then, his eyes finally focused on
what looked like two people, huddled together.  One of
them was a tall, gangly fellow with deep, dark, forest
green hair.  The other looked like Tsunami.  Looked too
damn much like Tsunami.  Suddenly, the Tsunami look
alike rose up and entered a stray beam of light. 
Tenchi gasped.  It WAS Tsunami.  'But, wasn't Sasami
trapped in the Dark Juraian dimension?'  Thought
Tenchi.  But he stopped thinking when Tsunami's eyes
went wide.  After a small tear fell, he felt her
embrace him.  'My god… Sasami's becoming just like her
mother…' thought Tenchi as he turned purple.  

	"OH MY GOODNESS!  I thought you were DEAD!" 
Tsunami exclaimed.

	"Shhh!  You'll wake up the others.  Anyway, where
have you been, why are you all grown up, and who is
he!?"  Tenchi whispered loudly, totally shocked at the
arrival of the Adult Sasami.

	"All in due time.  You must help me with my friend
here."  Tsunami exclaimed.

	Suddenly, a hand gripped Tsunami's shoulder. 
Terrified, both Tenchi and Tsunami turned around. 
Standing there was Yosho.  His concerned look turned
into a large smile as he scooped up Tsunami in a big
hug.  He looked as if he were to cry.  When he broke
the embrace, Tsunami put a finger to her lips to quiet
him.  He simply nodded.  In the corner of his eye,
Yosho saw a familiar form.  He turned his head and saw
the beady eyed servant boy who kidnapped Tsunami.  A
look of rage filled him as he began to summon a light
hawk sword.  Before he could, Tsunami put a calming
hand on Yosho's shoulder and pointed at his bloody,
ragged shirt.  Yosho looked at her and sighed, then
placed his hands at his sides.  Tsunami smiled, then
yawned.  Tenchi barely had a second to catch Tsunami
before she fell into an exhausted sleep.  Lifting up
the thin, young woman, Tenchi placed her on the floor
next to Ayeka, which became a soft mat, just like all
the other sections of the floor.  Smiling, Tenchi
looked at Yosho and winked.  Yosho smiled too and soon,
they both returned to their respective spots and
continued their much needed rest.  

*******************************************************

	Finally, Ayeka's eyes began to focus and the light
pouring in from the nearby star at last began to simmer
down.  She looked to her left and saw Tenchi, asleep on
the floor, his table having disappeared, and Ryoko
curled up in his arms.  Normally, she would have taken
offense to that, but, considering what the poor girl
had been through, she decided to give her a few moments
of peace.  'But don't I deserve the same?'  thought
Ayeka sadly.  She sighed as she slowly turned her head
and looked at the others.  Next to Tenchi lays an empty
table, Yosho, Keiko, and Takeshi.  Further around, she
saw Washu, who had returned to Ryo-oki to collect more
research on Matsui.  As to WHY she didn't just take him
to Leo-oki, Ayeka could not begin to guess.   She
blinked a few times and turned to her left.  She saw
the ship, Leo-oki, flying away out in the distance, she
guessed that Togusa and Gillian were still ticked off
and didn't sleep a wink.  Well, at least Sasami got a
good rest…

	'Wait… Sasami?' thought Ayeka as she gazed on her
sisters sleeping visage.  But she wasn't Sasami, she
was Tsunami.  She was fully grown and beautiful.  

	"Sasami…"  Ayeka muttered, somewhat loudly.  The
volume of Ayeka's comment woke her sister from her
slumber.  Sleepily, Tsunami smiled at her sister.

	"Hi Ayeka…" she managed to say before Ayeka leaped
at her sister and hugged her hard.

	"SASAMI!"  Ayeka sobbed with joy.  Her shout
managed to wake up everyone.  They all lazily looked up
and saw the formally missing, yet slightly older,
Sasami.  Misaki and Funaho leaped from their mats and
ran to her, giving her a massive group hug.  Soon,
Ryoko followed, and then Washu joined in.  When Washu
hugged Sasami, Ryoko began to reluctantly pull back,
but then decided against it.  Behind them stood Tenchi,
a big smile on his face, Yosho, likewise, and Keiko,
who held her son in her arms during this touching
moment.  Washu was near tears when she lifted her head
for some reason and looked at the empty table.  Empty?

	"Oh, god… MATSUI!" Washu yelled in despair as she
broke her embrace and ran to the table.  Her eyes
widened drastically as she eyed the table up and down,
totally confused.  

	"I don't get it!  He was there, and then he was
gone!  How could he have broken my access code!?  HOW
COULD HE HAVE GOTTEN PAST ALL MY DEFENSES AND OUT OF
THE CONTAINMENT FIELD!?!?"  Washu shouted in defeat. 
She kept on thinking, but in the bottom of her heart,
she knew that she knew the answer.  Her scientific
brain whizzed around all the possibilities as she
entered her access code and unlocked all of the inner
and outer defenses.  Then, as the containment field
dimmed away and the near invisible glass-like doors
began to open, the answer occurred to her.  'He
couldn't have gotten past all of the defenses if he had
never left in the first place…' she realized when the
doors finished opening and a huge energy surge blew
Washu back, singeing her clothes.  Out of the surge
flew a small, black object that landed a good distance
away from the group.  The energy took form and became
Matsui.  Only, this Matsui was different.  His eyes
were black and evil and pulsating with an evil red
light.  His grin was vile and his fangs jutted out. 
His long, shaggy red hair seemed to spike up like an
angered cat.  Quickly, Matsui jutted out his arms, one
of them ripped off at the elbow.  In a flash of light,
his arms were covered in a pair of wicked looking,
black guns.  Then the firing started.  The first bullet
flew at the small group before they could react, but
exploded a few inches away from them as both Ayeka and
Tsunami summoned double force fields and protected the
group.  The other bullet shaped laser blasts flew
through the ship, nearly hitting Tenchi, Yosho, Keiko,
and Takeshi.  Expertly dodging the blasts, Tenchi
summoned his Light Hawk sword.  Still dodging blasts
almost superhumanly, Tenchi rushed in for the strike,
only, when he swung, his target disappeared.  Before
Tenchi knew it, Matsui had reappeared behind him and
had summoned his laser Kitana.  Matsui swung before
Tenchi could react.  Luckily, Yosho leaped in between
the two and blocked the attack with his own light hawk
sword.  Growling evilly, Matsui leaped back and began
to type on his mini laptops.  As she watched, Ryoko's
eyes widened.

	"AYEKA!  Let me out!  I can help Tenchi!"  She
demanded.

	"No!  You'd only be a liability!  Tenchi would be
more concerned with keeping you alive than winning the
battle, and that might mean him dying… again!"  Ayeka
responded.  She saw Ryoko's eyes begin to get enraged. 
Seeing this, Tsunami waved her hand in front of Ryoko's
face.  Ryoko slumped over, unconscious.  Ayeka smiled
at her younger sister.  'At least she WAS my younger
sister…' Ayeka thought to herself.  A large blast broke
Ayeka away from her thoughts.  Now Takeshi joined it,
with his smaller, weaker Light Hawk sword.  Keiko ran
for the force bubble and passed through it like it
didn't exist.  She joined Ayeka, Tsunami, Washu, and
all the others in watching the battle.  The battle was
intense and was getting more so by the minute.  And it
looked like the Juraians were losing…

*******************************************************

	"NO!"  Screamed Togusa as scenes of the battle
popped into his head.  The Psychic link that he shared
with his brother was filling him in on the whole thing. 
And his head hurt too.

	"God damn it.  Why is it always ME who has to calm
the little freak down…"  Muttered Togusa as Leo-oki
altered its course and soared toward Ryo-oki.  Gillian
heard what he said and started to get worried.  She put
her hands together and prayed that Matsui was alright…

*******************************************************

	Tenchi, Yosho, and Takeshi stood side by side,
glaring at the maniacal little monster before them. 
This wasn't the sweet, loving, kind Matsui that they
all knew, it was a demonic creature, with Washu's
brains and capabilities… and it was kicking their ass. 
Tenchi looked at Yosho, who looked at him back, then
turned his gaze to Takeshi, who nodded.  Then, all at
once, the three leaped at him, screaming a battle cry
and focusing their power as much as they could.  Just
inches before they connected, a massive force field
threw them back against the opposite wall.  The three
Juraians struggled to move, but couldn't.  

	"Damn it.  Matsui did something to us…"  Takeshi
mumbled.

	Matsui then turned his evil attention toward the
force field surrounding the women.  He slowly motioned
his hands.  Energy arched all around them as Ayeka and
Tsunami began to scream bloody murder.  This woke Ryoko
up with a start.

	"My god… what the HELL is going ON!?"  Ryoko
wondered.

	"Matsui's reversing the energy flow of the force
field and causing a massive influx of the Juraian
energy!"  Washu yelled, frightened.

	"WHAT!?"  Ryoko shouted.

	"He's torturing Ayeka and Tsunami with their own
energy!  Is that CLEAR enough for you!?"  Washu
exclaimed.

	"Oh…"  Ryoko muttered, realizing what was
happening.  She looked at the two girls.  Ayeka was
bleeding out her nose, eyes and ears, so was Tsunami. 
A feeling of helplessness flooded over her as Ryoko
realized that she couldn't do anything to help, at
least while she was inside this bubble.  She gazed out
the window and saw a light blue streak, and then
smiled.  'Time to play our trump card…' Ryoko thought
devilishly to herself.  Matsui sensed the approaching
menace and typed on one of his mini-laptops.  Suddenly,
a large energy surge appeared on the hull of Ryo-oki as
a massive hole was blown into her side.  Ryo-oki let
out a massive, pained meow.  The limp and numb bodies
of Tenchi, Yosho, and Takeshi were being sucked out
into space right before Ryoko's eyes, and no matter how
much she screamed, she couldn't stop it.  Tenchi felt
himself being lifted into the air as he made it to the
hole, but instead of flying out into space, he seemed
to be slammed into the blackness.  That was when he
realized that it wasn't space, but the outer hull of
Leo-oki!  Leo-oki let out a mighty roar as Gillian and
Togusa teleported into Ryo-oki.  Gillian summoned her
laser staff and Togusa whipped out a large gun.  A
cigarillo dangled out from his mouth.  He looked like
he hadn't slept in days.

	"Boy, I'm really getting tired of you tantrums. 
You're grounded, junior."  He said.

	"Please, Matsui, WAKE UP!  Stop this!"  Gillian
cried.

	Matsui lunged toward Togusa and Gillian, fighting
with the tact of a wild animal, and growling like one
also.  Gillian and Togusa were having lots of trouble. 
Matsui slammed Togusa in the back of his head during an
impressive maneuver and knocked him out cold.  But,
before Matsui could recover, Gillian hit him a good
one, knocking him off balance.  Expertly getting back
on his feet, Matsui simply waved his hands and blew
Gillian five feet back.  Once again, he resummoned his
laser Kitana and slowly walked to Gillian.  His red,
glowing eyes burned with a deep hatred.  He rose his
sword and began to swing downward, when a pair of arms
surrounded his in a half nelson.  For some reason,
Matsui could not shake this pest off.  Matsui turned
his back to Gillian and she saw a green haired, beady
eyes fellow keeping hold of him.  The man's eyes were
black as pitch.  Mustering all her strength, Gillian
resummoned her laser staff and put it to Matsui's neck. 
Matsui stopped struggling and glared at her.  His face
contorted into a mask of rage as he growled an awful
lot like Leo-oki.  His fangs were bared as he turned
red with anger.  Tears fell from Gillian's eyes.

	"Matsui… please… don't make me do this!"  Gillian
pleaded.  

	"Gillian, NO!"  Shouted Tsunami.  Gillian turned
her head.

	"Who are you?  How do you know my name?"

	"I am Tsunami.  Trust me.  I can help…" Tsunami
added with confidence.  She got up and walked over to
the struggling Matsui and slowly closed her eyes.  

	"Love from the heart, knowledge from the mind,
guide this lost soul back to us and save him from the
darkness of despair.  From Earth to hell, then up to
heaven, guide my powers and cleanse his torn spirit…" 
Tsunami chanted.  Matsui lifted his head and ROARED. 
The transparent hull of the weakened Ryo-oki shuttered
with the force.  Slowly, light poured out of Matsui's
mouth and eyes.  The light grew until it became
blinding.  Then, like a bolt of lightning, it was gone. 
Matsui lie slumped and unconscious, his guns clanging
loudly against the ground, his lips gradually faded
back to their original color.  Matsui fell to the floor
as Zeb doubled over in pain.  Tsunami's pleasant face
faded and it turned to pained horror.  

	"Oh, no…Zeb!"  Tsunami lamented as she ran over to
him.  A trickle of blood dripped out of his mouth.

	"Why… do you… care… for me…. after considering…
what I… have…done…"  Zeb gurgled.

	"You were just under their control, you couldn't
help it.  I forgive you…" Tsunami whispered as she
touched her forehead to his.

	"…Kindness… it is… so… alien to… me… please…
hurry… there still… is… time…"  Zeb continued.

	"Time…?  For what?"  Tsunami murmured quietly.  

	"… To… save… Jurai… go now… they… are weakened…
without… the… tree……."  Zeb said as he trailed off, and
then went silent.  Around him, a black smoke formed
around Zeb.  Tsunami cried a few more tears before
wiping them away.  Ayeka, still cleaning the blood off
of her face, walked over to Tsunami.  A look of
curiosity was apparent on her face.  

	"What did he mean 'to save Jurai?', he didn't mean
what I think he means, does he?"  Ayeka hoped.

	"That's IT!  That's why Tsunami is still alive. 
The tree of light still lives… that's it!  That's their
plan!  They want to corrupt the tree of life and use it
to take over our dimension!  Why didn't I see it
sooner!?"  Washu exclaimed loudly.  The rest of the
group gasped at her revelation.  Tenchi finally was
able to stand, and he did so.  He clenched his fist in
determination.  

	"Then we know what we must do.  Washu, finish your
research on the transdimentional stuff, and then we
must prepare.  Soon, this is all gonna end… one way… or
the other…"  Tenchi informed.  Soon, he was joined by
Ryoko, then Ayeka, and then the rest of the group, save
Matsui, who was still out cold.  

	"We must win, there can be no other solution.  If
we lose, countless lives will be lost.  I pray for our
victory." Funaho said to the group, her voice grave and
serious.  With help from Leo-oki, Ryo-oki sped off to
the great unknown.  Now is the beginning of the end…
