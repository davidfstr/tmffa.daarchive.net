When Mihoshi and Kiyone landed on Earth they hadn't said a word to each other. They silently 
walked side by side to the house. When they arrived at the house they didn't even bother to say 
hello, they simply walked up to their room and closed the door. 

Ryoko's eyes moved from the soaps long enough to see the whole thing. 

Tenchi saw her and asked, "What is it Ryoko?"

Ryoko shook her head and shrugged, "I don't know, but I think I need to talk to someone..." She 
vanished into air, Tenchi shrugged and continued watching.

Washuu rubbed her chin in query. <Hmm...I think you're right, Ryoko, but should we interfere with 
this?>

Ryoko sighed inside her head, <If we don't do this, they'll never find happiness.>

<I've been watching them the last few days, and I just don't think Kiyone is ready to handle that 
kind of relationship. Not just yet.>

<Well, the least we could do is try calming them down a bit.>

<I don't know...>

<Look, mom, remember what you said to me about that time Tenchi slapped me over Mayuka?>

<Yes, but...>

<You said that if I didn't get rid of the tension between us, we could never work out! We've got to 
at least try!> 
Washuu sighed defeatedly, <I suppose...Hey Ryoko?>

<Yeah?>

Washuu smiled pleasantly. <You realize you called me 'mom', right?>

Ryoko giggled a bit, <Yeah I guess I did. Well, I have to talk to someone. Bye mom!>

<Bye honey!> Washuu lay back in her chair and sighed. <I hope this works out.>

Mihoshi lay on her back, sobbing and staring into the twinkling stars of the setting sky. They 
burned with twilight glow. It almost lifted Mihoshi spirit...almost. 

A familiar spiky-haired shadow appeared over her crying figure. She wiped away a tear and said 
in almost a whisper, "Hey Ryoko..." Her voice was dreary and concealing.

"What's up? Usually this is my place.", Ryoko said jokingly. 

Mihoshi sniffled and bit her lip. "I'm sorry, Ryoko. If I'm in your way, I'll leave..."

Ryoko turned solemn faced. "No, Mihoshi. Don't worry about it. I was just joking.", she said 
nervously. 

Mihoshi wiped another tear away and turned to face her. She faked a smile. "Okay. Thank you, 
Ryoko." 

But Ryoko could see through it. She frowned anxiously. "What's wrong, Mihoshi? You don't seem 
to be your normal bouncy self today." Mihoshi shrugged it off and tried to look away. But she 
found another Ryoko in front of her. "C'mon answer me.", the two Ryokos sat down on her sides 
and looked at her caring look, most uncharacteristic of her. 

Mihoshi looked from one Ryoko to the next, looking for a way out. She sighed defeatedly. "It's 
Kiyone..."

Ryoko smiled and nodded knowingly. "I know that, what about her?"

Mihoshi felt a cold trail of sweat on her back. She started to shake nervously. "Well...she...I...I 
don't know. I think she...hates me." The last part was a whisper.

Ryoko face turned to a frown. "Oh...why?"

Mihoshi's tears started to flow again. "Well, something she said and something I...did."

"What did she say?"

Mihoshi looked down, ashamed. "Well, I asked her how she felt about me...and at first she said 
that I was a great friend and that she really liked me. But...but then I hugged her, like I always hug 
her...and she just freaked out and threw me away from her. She said that two girls shouldn't...do 
things like that. Then I slapped her...hard."

Ryoko's expression was now confused and worried. "Why did you slap her?"

Mihoshi shook her head. "I...I don't know. I didn't mean to." Mihoshi embraced Ryoko in a hug 
that would make Misaki proud. "I'm so scared that she'll...hate me. I...*sniff*...love her so much. I 
so sorry...I wish I could tell her."

Ryoko's heart melted as she held the sobbing blonde. "It's alright Mihoshi. I'm sure she won't hate 
you...Kiyone wouldn't do that. And...if you love her, you should probably be talking to someone 
else." She made a caring smile.

Mihoshi wiped away a tear. "But what if she does...*snifff*...hate me...I don't think I could take that 
kind of *sniff* pain."

Ryoko pulled back at looked her straight  in the eyes. "Does it hurt now?"

Mihoshi nodded weakly. "Yes..."

"The only way to stop the pain is to tell her. If she doesn't feel the same way then at least she'll 
know how you feel and then you won't have to worry anymore. I felt the same way the day I told 
Tenchi, but I was lucky. He loved me too. But if he hadn't I would have lived, I might have been 
mad, but at least I would have to worry all the time about it...I would just move on. But sitting 
here, beating yourself up about it isn't going to help." Ryoko wiped away a few of her own tears. 
"Do you understand?" 

Mihoshi smiled and nodded. "Yes...thank you so much Ryoko." She embraced Ryoko again. 
"Your such a great friend!" 

Ryoko smiled and hugged her back. "You too, kiddo."

Kiyone wasn't sure what was happening. One moment she was laying on her bed, looking at 
Mihoshi climb out the window, the next she was sitting in strange couch/bed mix sitting next to an 
extravagant armchair, surrounded by...well, nothing. She rubbed her head in confusion. "Were 
the hell am I?" Then came the obvious answer; "Washuu..."

Out of...well, nowhere came Washuu, decked out in her Science academy uniform and a pair of 
turtle shell-rimmed bifocals. "Good evening Mrs. Makibi, are you comfortable?"

Kiyone looked at he like she was crazy (which she is...*bonk* ow!) and asked, "Little Washuu, 
what the hell is going on, where am I?"

Washuu shook her head and said, "Not Little Washuu. For today it's, Mrs. Washuu! And you're in 
therapy."

Kiyone blinked and confusion bubbles appeared around her head. "O...kay, _Mrs._ Washuu, may 
I ask why?" 

Washuu smiled mischievously and shook her head, "No, actually, you can't!"

"What?!? Why not?!?!?" She shouted angrily.

Washuu sighed. "Because then you wouldn't agree to do it!" She said as if it were obvious. 

Kiyone grew even angrier, she stood up and shouted, "I'm not doing it either way!!!" 

Washuu looked at her quizzically, "And why not?"

Kiyone started to stutter, "W-well, i-it's...you n-never...well..."

Washuu smiled and sat down in the armchair. "Is it about your past?"

Kiyone started to sweat nervously, "Of course not! I just...I..."

Washuu's smile broadened. "Well, in that case I suggest you sit, because you're not leaving till I 
figure you out!" She pointed to the couch/bed thing.

Kiyone plopped down obediently and sighed. "Something tells me I'm not gonna like this."

"Nonsense, and when it's done you'll feel so relieved, you can talk to everyone about your 
feelings." Washuu pulled out a note pad and said. "Alright, let's start at the beginning!"

Mihoshi

It hurts
Not knowing how she feels
Not knowing if you're hated or loved
Not knowing if you're wanted on shunned
I want to scream,
But no one will hear
I want to cry,
But no one will support me
I want to die,
But no one will care
I listen,
But no one speaks
I support,
But no one cries
I care,
But no one lives
I love
But no one knows...
