	At the security post located on the edge of the Alcaron territory...none 
of the officers on board noticed any particular disturbances that day.  They 
were completely unaware of the ship that had passed them over three hours ago 
and would never have guessed the identity of its occupant.  
	Aboard the Heart of Darkness, Vin-Roc quietly meditated on his approaching 
target.  He sat in darkness and set the computer to fly in under cloak.  
"Computer...estimated time of arrival?"  The computer hummed slightly and spat 
out "Arrival will be in approximately two sub-jahs (two minutes Earth standard)" 
He leaned back, his face covered in the paint that signified his frame of mind, 
that being of red and black.  He was only bringing 
with him his blade that had so many times in the past saved him from near death.  
He wanted no guns and no fancy tricks.  

	If at all possible, he wanted to keep this as honorable as possible.  "Now 
entering atmosphere of Alcaron...beginning final descent"  "Computer.have we 
been detected?"  "Negative...all systems show planet on regular security levels"  
"Very well then..." The ship screamed across the sky but disturbed no homes or 
radar systems.  "Closing in on Imperial Council Headquarters...shall I decrease 
our speed and begin landing procedures?"  "Negative, continue at current speed, 
and prepare to open drop hatch...I must leave you now computer...you will 
continue on course and proceed to the nearest asteroid and await further 
command"  "Understood...it was an honor working with you...if you do not succeed 
that is"  "The same here computer..." The hatch opened and the ship's occupant 
dropped from the sky and decelerated its descent using light waves of energy to 
slow its' velocity.  

	Upon landing, Vin-Roc quickly stole away into the shadows and approached 
the gates.  Above him, his ship continues its course and 
quickly left the atmosphere.  Tapping a few buttons on his console pad, he 
quickly faded from normal vision and soon blended into every background that he 
touched.   

	At the gates, he quickly discovered that there were no guards at their 
post.  "...they must have gotten my message...they're obviously expecting me, 
all the better" He leaped over the gates and proceeded towards the entrance of 
the headquarters.  Blending from one background to another, he did his best to 
avoid the token soldiers that were left around in order to not let him feel too 
comfortable about the situation.  He had no intention of fighting his own people 
if possible.he wanted to save his anger for the 
Council themselves.  

	A sound from behind him caused him to reach for his blade by reflex, but 
held back when he noticed it was a soldier making a turn in the opposite 
direction.  It was not a difficult environment to maneuver around; in fact it 
was rather simple.  This was so because not many individuals ever entered 
these halls so hiding or confusing was not a major concern of the buildings 
design.  Continuing up to the main door, he noticed two soldiers stationed in 
front of the last obstacle that stood between himself and his redemption.  Vin-
Roc bounded from one wall to another finally landing behind the soldiers. He 
quickly struck them in sensitive pressure points and both soldiers went down.  

	His heart began to race as he realized just what lay behind these doors.  
His hand was on the handle; nearly ready to turn it and enter when he 
stopped and pulled back.  "Wait...I need a better approach than this...let me 
see...yes that will do...that will do most nicely" He focused his thoughts and 
energy into a single object; one he hoped would help to even the odds against 
his adversaries.  

	The Imperial Council was expecting his return and was not disappointed.  
The doors swung open and the one soldier they wanted eliminated more than 
anything else was standing before them.  "Hmmm...I 
see this place has changed little since I was last here." Vin-Roc smiled and 
shot a look at all five councilmen who returned the icy gaze back to him.  
"So...our beloved and favorite warrior has returned...I hope it was not too long 
of a wait for you..." The first councilman spoke, leaning forward bringing his 
face into full view.  "You realize that by returning you have sealed your fate?"  
The second councilman spoke and he too leaned forward and brought his face into 
full view.  

	"My fate...yes indeed I have...but I did not come here only to leave 
alone, I'm going to make it a point that I see each and every one of you...in 
HELL!!!"  Vin-Roc's words echoed through the halls and some of the councilmen 
appeared nervous.  "You do not think to best us...to bite the hand that fed 
you...that made you what you are today, do you?"  The fourth councilman spoke 
with authority and shook an elderly finger at him.  "Fed me...the only thing you 
feed me, and every other person on this planet, was a pack of lies. Now, enough 
talk, let us end this!"  He straightened his stance and readied himself for 
battle.  "As you wish dear Vin-Roc.it will be a shame to watch you die...we had 
such plans for you.you may have him" 

	The first councilman motioned to the fifth and he leaped from his seat 
landing a few yards away from Vin-Roc.  "Well, shall we begin?" Vin-Roc motioned 
to the councilman and they both assumed their fighting stances.  The councilman 
was the first to go and took a diving thrust at Vin-Roc who parried it away and 
answered with one of his own.  It connected and the fifth councilman was thrown 
back.  High above, the other councilman watched on as both combatants went back 
and forth, both delivering and avoiding one another's' shots.  Finally, the 
fifth councilman went for the kill when he noticed Vin-Roc hesitated for a 
moment and showed a few signs of pain.  He went in for a thundering blow, but 
was met with a hand to his midsection.  
	With a mighty war cry, Vin-Roc pushed his hand straight through the 
midsection of the councilman who immediately spat blood.  He looked at Vin-Roc 
and spoke "Was...was that...the hand of...Seljin...?"  "Indeed it was...goodbye 
councilman" Was his response followed by a sickening crack as he snapped the 
spine of his adversary.  The councilman fell dead into a pool of his own blood.  
Vin-Roc looked up and held an evil smile at the remaining council members.  
"So...who is next?"  The board felt concerned never realizing that he would have 
made it this far.  

	Suddenly, Vin-roc felt a warm sensation in his stomach.  He looked down 
and saw the reason for this.his entire midsection had been shot through by a 
powerful beam.  High above, the first councilman decided to end this and took 
aim and fired upon the soldier below, who finally fell dead too in his own 
blood.  

	The first councilman had a look of satisfaction on his face, confident 
that this was truly the end of their problem.  As far as he was concerned, the 
fallen councilman was a necessary sacrifice, and was beginning to become 
incompetent in any case.  "Well...that finally ends that little nuisance...what 
say we convene for today and..." He was interrupted by the sound of applause 
coming from a distance.  

	Looking in the direction of the sound, they all strained to see in the 
dark what it was.  "Very good councilman..."  The voice spoke "Very sneaky as 
well...but you did always lack honor..." His outline made it obvious who it was 
that was approaching them.  He came over to the fallen body that was his exact 
in every way.  Picking it up by the neck, he examined it and threw it into the 
corner, and then incinerated it.  "Ah...the marvel of clones...a pity they don't 
keep up for too long.  I knew you would do something like that...so I took a few 
moments to construct a clone to take my 
place...to help level the playing field" 

	The first councilman nodded to his tactfulness.  "Truly, you are a 
survivor, and an excellent tactician.  You're skills are truly extaordinary, you 
make a worthy adversary...but sadly...now the game shall end!"   

	With that, the four remaining councilmen leaped from their seats and fell 
to the ground, surrounding Vin-Roc on all four sides.  Using the moment of 
surprise all four members engulfed Vin-Roc in a ball of energy.  "This is how it 
shall end for you" spoke the first  "You will die as a traitor" Spoke the 
second.  "We shall be hailed as heroes" Spoke the third.  "You will fade 
away...and forever be known as a failure" Spoke the fourth.  
	"Arrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhh!!!"  He could fell himself losing 
consciousness.  He never knew just how powerful they were, and the smell of his 
own flesh burning was proof enough.  (I...can't...do it...too 
powerful...dammit...I failed)  He could still hear them taunting him, but their 
words were becoming harder and harder to discern.  Just as he was about to die, 
he thought of his last words to the reason why he came back here.  (What did I 
say...can't remember...think...WHAT WAS IT!!! Wait, I promised her..."Ryoko...I 
promise you this, when all of this is over, I'll come 
back for you...I swear it...just believe in me till then" I promised her.
I must try...if nothing else.I MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  
	"AAARRGGGHHH...DAMN YOU...DAMN YOU ALL...TO HELL IS WHERE I WILL SEND 
YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  With that, he summed up all his hope, all his 
love, all his pain, all his loss, and all he stood to gain, and focused it into 
one last attack.  The ensuing ball of energy he released cleaved off the entire 
right side of the palace and was felt nearly across the entire 
continent.  Many in the distance looked to the sky and wondered.what could have 
possibly have done that?  

	In what was the remaining part of the palace...the debris lay everywhere.  
In the distance, three councilmen tried to get to their feet.  The managed to 
achieve this, vomited blood, and fell back down, and 
they remained there, dead.  Vin-Roc staggered to get to his feet; he managed 
this and saw the other three councilmen fall dead before him.  He forced a smile 
but then realized one was still remaining.  

	A few yards off, he saw the first councilman push away some debris and 
wipe some blood from his face.  "Outstanding!  You have impressed me.  You have 
done what countless races with armies numerous in size failed to do. We were 
correct in choosing you as our herald.  Oh if only you remained loyal to us"  
"Never!  I would sooner die then serve such vile creatures as yourselves" Both 
stood and realized this would be the final battle.  

	The combatants drew their blades and in an instant were upon each other.  
One striking after another, most of their attacks were blocked, the ones that 
made their mark were slight ones.  After some time though, the first councilman 
began to show his experience by avoiding Vin-Roc's slash and 
slicing him across his chest.  Another two blows landed on Vin-Roc who was 
slowing down and bleeding rather badly.  The councilman sensed victory and went 
in for the kill.  

	The soldier knew he had only seconds to act.  He stretched out his arm 
with blade in hand and reflected the sunlight from the gaping hole in the palace 
and shined it into the councilman's eyes.  He was temporarily blinded, but that 
was all Vin-Roc needed.  Racing in, he took three mortal swipes across the 
councilman's midsection, all making their mark.  He watched as his opponent 
tried to stand his ground, but eventually fell to one knee.  
"...very...very well indeed...<cough>...curse you...but you 
have...won...<cough>...won...thy freedom, use it...wisely" With that, the 
councilman collapsed.  Vin-Roc looked to the heavens.  Badly 
bleeding, he knew his time left was short.  

	"I...I did it...Ryoko...I did it...Annexia...soon...very soon...I 
shall join you...my wife...I shall join you...soon" He dropped his blade and 
collapsed to the ground, and did not move again, his mission was complete, 
almost.

*****************************************************************************

	Ryoko shot up from her bed covered in sweat.  It was well past midnight 
and the pirate suddenly felt deep inside her what she hoped would never happen.  
She immediately teleported out of the house and began flying as fast as she 
could.there were tears in her eyes as she approached a nearby mountain.  
(No...no...no...no...it can't be...it just can't be...you promised me...you 
promised me!!!!!!)  Atop the mountain, Ryoko cleared her throat and looked up to 
the moon.  She let out a scream that would wake any 
who would hear her cry of remorse "NNNNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!" But she already 
knew it was true.  She stayed the rest of the night atop the mountain, sitting 
with her head buried in her shoulders sobbing, but never slept.

*****************************************************************************
	
	The celebration at the Masaki's was a special one indeed.  It had been 
three months since Kiyone and Tenchi had returned to Earth together, and were 
now celebrating the announcement of their engagement.  Mihoshi was so happy for 
her partner she was the first to cry.  Sasami had made a special 
meal for everyone on this day.  Tenchi's father was so proud of him for taking 
the next step in becoming a man and Grandfather had requested that when the time 
comes it be he that delivers the wedding.  Washu 
was happy for them both, but was still very concerned with her partner Ryoko. 
She stood by the door of her laboratory and tried to look happy as Sasami tried 
offering her some snacks.  Everyone was having a great time...that is except for 
one person in particular.  

	Outside by the lake, Ryoko looked at the peaceful body of water, wishing 
her life was as calm and smooth.  (I...never said goodbye...never said that 
I...)  "Ryoko" Tenchi called out to her as he approached.  He was walking 
towards her when he said "Ryoko...why don't you come inside,please?" She still 
had her back to him.  She couldn't face him knowing that he was the second 
person she had just lost in such a short time.  

	"Tenchi...I...I have to go for a while" His first reaction was that of 
shock.  He couldn't believe that she would do this, but then he realized that 
she needed her space and he respected that decision.  "He's gone 
you know?"  she mentioned to him.  "No, I didn't...I'm so sorry.  How did you 
know?"  Tenchi felt even more surprised by this news.  "It's a feeling... one 
that I know is true" She wished so dearly she was wrong.  "Will you ever some 
back again?"  Tenchi didn't want her to leave like this.  "I...Idon't know. NOW 
I've lost two people in my life.I don't have much reason to stay here...but 
before I go, I want you to have this" She took his hand and quickly put the 
contents in his palm.  

	He looked at her gift and tried to protest, "But Ryoko...this is the 
crystal I gave you, this what brought us together, why?" he was trying to 
understand the meaning of this  "Don't get the wrong idea Tenchi.I still care 
about you...nothing will ever change that.  But you're going to need this more 
than I will.  You have someone now that you have to protect.  Please, take it" 
Reluctantly, Tenchi nodded his head and turned her around.  He saw she was 
crying and wanted so badly to make her pain go away.  This time though, there 
would be no easy solutions...so he did the next best thing, he kissed her.  
"I...I would have waited forever for that 
Tenchi, thank you" She hugged him and turned heading towards her ship.

	Kiyone soon came out to look for Tenchi when she saw him by the lake with 
his hands by his side.  She came up behind him and put her arm around him and 
leaned her head on his shoulder.  "What is it Tenchi?" she wanted to know what 
had him so down.  "It's...Ryoko she left, and gave me this" He 
showed her the crystal, which made her gasp.  "Don't misunderstand, she's still 
my friend.  Its just that...she said I would need it more than her, that I have 
someone to protect, and she was right" 

	Tenchi turned around and took Kiyone in a close embrace "I love you 
Kiyone" She felt her heart skip a beat every time he said that to her and she 
kissed him.  "Come on, let's go back inside, they're all looking for us" They 
turned and started walking back to the house.  (Thanks Ryoko...for 
understanding, for being there, for everything...please come back soon)  Above, 
Ryoko's ship accelerated out of Earth's orbit and headed towards nowhere in 
particular.
 
*****************************************************************************

	On a planet far off in the Alevian Galaxy, the inhabitants of one of the 
larger cities on this planet was having its annual Festival of Life and the 
lights from the city could be seen for a great distance in all 
directions.  Many were flocking from all over to participate and join in on the 
joyous festivities.  It was getting on in the day heading towards evening and 
the participants were getting ready for things to really pickup.  In the 
distance, outside of town, a lonely figure sat atop a rocky cliff overlooking 
the ocean watching the waves crash down below.  Under normal circumstances, this 
would have been a truly inspirational sight, but this was not to be.  

	Ryoko simply sat there alone, watching the waves crash back and forth.  
She felt the waves were like her life.  They would constantly come in strong 
from nowhere, but would then crash and cease to exist, and the cycle would 
continue.  It reminded her of her emotions and relationships.  They would come 
on strong and she would be happy, but then because of circumstances usually 
beyond her control, things would abruptly turn and go south.  
	
	The pirate sat there quietly, contemplating a number of things, and of 
nothing in particular.  The sky was getting dark, and the stars would be coming 
out soon.  (I just can't seem to get it right.  What do I have to do 
before...before I can finally win for a change?)  She decided then that 
the best thing to do was something she would never try under the usual 
circumstances.  Ryoko was not the one who believed in fairy tales or knights in 
shinning armor coming to rescue a damsel in distress.  But this 
time, she was willing to try...and to believe.  She put her hands together, 
lowered her head and closed her eyes.  With her heart open for the heavens to 
hear her, she whispered..."Starlight, starbrite, first star I see tonight, wish 
I may, wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight...I have lived too long and 
have lost so much...if nothing else I ask for is..." She started to cry "is to 
finally win...<sniff> win the heart of the one I truly love and to make it last 
always...please believe me.  If nothing else I ask for <sniff>...please...hear 
me" She wiped her eyes and never noticed the 
first star out in the sky streaking past her, and that it heard her prayer.

	"Well...I never thought the great Ryoko was ever the hopeless romantic." A 
voice form behind spoke.  She had no idea that this voice belonged to someone 
who had been standing there for quite sometime and had too heard her prayer.  
"Mister...you picked a really bad time to mess with me, get ready to" Ryoko was 
beginning to power up an energy blast in her hand when she fully turned around.  
Looking up, she saw the origin of the voice.  
	A tall individual, clad entirely in black with a flowing cape stood there 
and simply smiled at her.  At first, this only served to anger her 
even more.until she looked into his eyes, and realized who was in front of her.  
"Oh...my...god...it can't be...can it?"  The tears began to fall from her eyes 
again "Oh please don't tease me!  It can't be, please tell me!!!"  She wiped her 
eyes thinking she was seeing things.  When she was done, the figure was still 
there and still smiling at her.  

	"It...it...it is you...but how...I thought you were"  "I was" the figure 
spoke.  "But...as I was dying, I remembered.remembered that I made you a 
promise, and I had every intention of keeping that promise.  That is what 
brought me back from death" Ryoko hand a hand over her moth still completely in 
shock.  "It wasn't easy finding you...you seem to move quite a number of 
times,but now."  

	His demeanor changed to a more serious one  "Now that I found you, l 
wanted to tell you, I did it, my time for running is over.  I don't have to 
hide, I don't need to live in fear anymore.  The Council is no more, and my name 
has been cleared.  But there still is a part of me that is not complete" She 
waited to hear the rest his words hanging on to every last one of them  
	
	"That part is you Ryoko; you are the missing part of my life.  I have my 
whole life ahead of me, but I don't want it to be without you. Please, come back 
with me.  My life won't be worth living for without you.  You don't need to be 
alone anymore" Ryoko simply stared at him with her head swirling with thoughts 
and confusement.  (Can it be...did someone really hear my 
wish...and answer it.  What do I do?)  

	He could feel how confusing this must have been to her.  He simply 
stretched out his hand to her "Please Ryoko...I love you.  Come back with me, 
please" At that, Ryoko quickly ran past his hand and threw herself into his 
arms.  She whispered into his ear "I will never lose you again, I promise!"  
Tears for two fell that night as the festivities began off in the direction of 
the city.

*****************************************************************************

	"But it's been three months already!"  Tenchi spoke with a bit of panic in 
his voice.  All of the family was gathered in the living room trying to console 
Tenchi, including Kiyone who had taken a seat by his side.  She held his hand 
looking at the matching engagement rings they wore.  (I wish there was something 
I could do for him.  He really is worried about her).  "Look Tenchi, don't 
worry, Ryoko will be fine, she's a big girl and can take care of herself.  
Besides, she hasn't gone and committed any crimes or we would have heard 
something by now" 

	Tenchi felt a little more relieved and grateful for having such a caring 
person in his life like Kiyone.  He really had made the right choice. 
At first, Aeka was very upset about him choosing Kiyone over her, but after a 
short while, the princess accepted and respected his choice, though she was 
still determined to find a way into his heart somehow.  He leaned over and 
kissed Kiyone to thank her for her support and she returned the favor by 
thanking him for thanking her.  

	Almost immediately, Washu burst out of her laboratory wild eyed.  "HEY, 
GET IN HERE, ALL OF YOU!"  Tenchi looked at Washu with curiosity as to what the 
scientist was up to.  "What is it Washu?"  "I just got a message 
from Ryoko.  I didn't check it out yet because..." She never finished because 
the entire gang stampeded over her heading straight into her room.  "...because 
I wanted you all to see it." She face vaulted in pain from the pounding she just 
took.  

	A few minutes later when she awoke, she walked over to her console and 
punched up the message.  "TADA!"  She exclaimed but noted their confused look, 
then they face vaulted.  Washu looked and saw it was in Alcaronian "Oopss...heh 
heh...don't worry, I'll have my computer translate it for us" She replied 
scratching the back of her head.  After tapping a few buttons, the message came 
up in readable text.  

	They all looked in surprise and awe.  The message read:  'You have been 
invited by special request to attend a momentous event, the joining together of 
the new prince of Alcaron, Vin-Roc, and the soon to be princess of Alcaron, 
Ryoko.  Please honor us by your presence at this most joyous of events'.  Below 
the text was a picture included which showed both Vin-Roc and Ryoko holding one 
another in a close embrace.  "Oh that's so beautiful..." Sasami was the first to 
note and began to cry, Mihoshi soon joined her.  
	Washu sniffed a little bit (You did good Ryoko...real good.  I'm proud of 
you.but now I gotta find a new partner!!)  She face vaulted, but no one seemed 
to notice.  Even Aeka was somewhat happy for Ryoko (Well...at least she won't be 
around here to cause any more problems for Lord Tenchi) She snickered to 
herself.  

	Tenchi and Kiyone simply looked at the image, they both imagined the 
day when that would be them.  Kiyone leaned over to Tenchi and whispered "You 
know Tenchi, maybe we should get married there too.  I hear Alcaron is a 
beautiful place any time of the year" He suddenly blushed over this sudden 
suggestion "Uh...well...uh...we'll talk about it on the way there okay?"  She 
smiled and leaned over and hugged him "Whatever you say Tenchi, darling" He 
hugged her back, finally feeling that everything had worked out just 
right, almost as if someone had a hand in all of this.  (Hmmm.. I wonder...nah, 
it doesn't matter.  I only wish mother were here now though.  I know she'd be 
happy with my choice.  I just know it)    

*****************************************************************************
	                 
   Outside the Masaki residence, off a little while away, there was a cave.  
Inside the cave, there was a little girl who had been beleived to be sleeping 
for sometime now.  She did this on her own accord, knowing she was too much of a 
danger to others.  She agreed to sleep until she was able to control her 
abilities. 

	But before she truly went to sleep, Yugi decided she would do one last 
thing, to make up for all the trouble she had caused.  (Well, I'm glad that all 
worked out, it wasn't easy getting them all together like that.  Even for me, 
Tenchi...I'm sorry about Sakuya, I never meant to hurt you.  I only hope that 
this new love in your life will be enough to make up for that loss.  She is a 
good person Tenchi, take care of her.  Ryoko, please stay with him; I know he'll 
make you happy.  Oh Sasami, we will have so much to talk about when I wake up, 
in a couple of years...so don't you worry!  Just remember...never think you're 
too old to wish upon star...you never know who's listening) Feeling satisfied 
with a job well done, Yugi finally decided to get some rest.  Outside, it was 
getting dark, and the stars were coming out.

*****************************************************************************

I truly hope you all enjoyed my first work.  I know that some may have a problem 
with Ryoko not getting with Tenchi, please don't take it personal.  
I simply wanted to try a different approach.
