Chapter #5: The Waiting Game  
  
Sunday Night 
After everyone had helped to clean up after dinner  
(With the exception of Washu and Katsuhito, who were busy elsewhere ;) 
)  
The different members of the family got ready for bed. 
Nobuyuki had escorted Mihoshi to her bedroom. Since he worked the next 
day he would find himself  
sleeping on the couch as normally he would be living in an apartment he 
rented  
in town during the week. His old room was now Mihoshi's.  
"Thank you for the walk tonight. It sure was ...enlightening!" said a 
smiling and Mihoshi.  
"Yes it was at that, and seeing my Achika again just made it so 
perfect." He wiped a tear from his eye.  
They looked fondly at each other and leaned in for a good night kiss 
when their foreheads smashed together.  
"Ouch!" was heard from both as they rubbed their foreheads. 
Well Goodnight Mihoshi, sleep well." Said Nobuyuki. 
"Good night noble Nobuyuki!" She paused then said, "Nobuyuki, ca-cann 
you stay with me tonight.  
I know we can't do anything?" (she remembered what Washu had said)  
"But I feel lonely and I need to be held, and I..."  
She fell into his arms crying, he simply nodded, picked her up in his 
arms and took her inside  
to lay her down on her bed. He then stood up and went to the door.  
There was a moments hesitation ... as both made eye contact. Nobuyuki's 
look of apprehension,  
Mihoshi's look of need for companionship. He closed the sliding door, 
and got into her bed.  
He wrapped his arms around her as she laid her head on his chest.  
The same position they woke up to that fateful morning. They slowly 
drifted off to sleep.  
Smiles of contentment on their faces. As a familiar astral figure 
floated beside them  
with a happy and contented look before fading away.

Up at the shrine, in a priest's bedroom lay to nude figures 
intertwined.  
But were sleeping and held each other tightly. More so than most.  
Betraying the longing for each other that they had been seeking for a 
long time.  
It seems that they had found a cure for that with each other. Time 
would see if this would last.  
The week coming up would hold the key to that and the other's futures.

The scene was a bit different in Tenchi's room. As Tenchi was helping 
Sasami finish cleaning  
the kitchen his two fianc‚s were in his room talking. 
"Well, Princess, do you think he'll go for it?" 
"I would think so, with both of us asking." 
"Well, remember his inhibitions are back up again, so even though he 
proposed that doesn't  
mean he'd go along with this!" said Ryoko 
True, but as we have already agreed, it would be wise for him to 
accept.  
Lest we deprive him of our presence!" said a confident Ayeka 
"To accept what Ayeka?" asked Tenchi who had caught the last sentence 
said by Ayeka. 
both girls stood up and moved towards where Tenchi was standing.  
Just as they got in front of him he noticed them. 2 futons where one 
had been. 
"Ok, why are those here for?" asked a now annoyed Tenchi. 
Well Tenchi dear, we are now your fianc‚'s and since we slept together 
last night..." started Ryoko. 
"...we would like to continue that from now on, Lord Tenchi." finished 
Ayeka. 
"Now, wait a minute, remember what Washu said, we can't.... do that 
right now!"  
said a now blushing Tenchi. 
"We didn't mean that silly. We just meant that we should sleep together 
to adjust ourselves  
to being together later." replied a smiling Ryoko. 
"As Ryoko said, we need to start adjusting to being with each other.  
My Mother and Auntie Funaho did the same thing when they wed father." 
added Ayeka. 
"Well,...  Ok!" Both girls then glomped him. "But, there will be some 
rules observed here,  
and if you break them, your out of here, got it!" Both girls nodded as 
he continued. 
"1. We observe Washu's request and not have ahhh well you know none of 
that for now  
(And hopefully till the Honeymoon he hoped. He sighed and went on.)  
"2. No fighting when in this room. This is now a non combat area." Both 
agreed.  
"And 3. Nothing more than what I allowto happen. That means both of you 
not just Ryoko, Ayeka."  
Ayeka looked surprised, but complied with this request.  
Ryoko nodded yes simply so she could be held and be next to Tenchi. 
As all three adjusted the futons, Ryoko said "Tenchi, Ayeka please 
remind me to  
talk to Mom about getting a larger bed." Both of them nodded yes and 
they laid down  
and got into a spoon position with Ryoko in front ofTenchi, and Ayeka 
behind Tenchi.  
They wrapped their arms around the person in front of them and then 
leaned to each other  
for a good night kiss.  
Tenchi was still nervous. He did trust the girls to keep their word. 
His worry was himself.  
"How can I keep control of myself. I have to do this now or I'll never 
get enough rest."  
he said to himself. 
As the three slowly nodded off to sleep contented grins spread on all 
three faces.  
They knew that this would be the beginning of their new life together, 
and after Saturday  
even more so. They dreamed of themselves and their future.

After breakfast, Monday 
Tenchi was headed for the fields as the others were headed for their 
chores.  
Ryoko the appeared in front of him.  
"Ryoko don't you have chores to do?" spoke a now irritated Tenchi. 
"Oh my Tenchi. I just wanted to have some time alone away from the 
others , and Ayeka!"  
Said Ryoko. 
"Now that isn't fair Ryoko. We'll make time to be alone later.  
And that means I'll make time for Ayeka as well."  
Tenchi stated what will become a running statement. Especially for 
Ryoko. 
"Oh. but Tenchi, I..." 
"No buts, Ryoko. Now if you want to be my fianc‚, I am asking you to do 
your chores.  
Then maybe later we'll go for a walk, OK?"Asked Tenchi in more loving 
terms.  
Ryoko then smiled, then kissed Tenchi full on the lips and waved to him 
a she disappeared. 
"Oh Man, I hope I can make it to the end of the week." thought Tenchi 
rubbing his neck  
as he continued to the carrot fields. 
Ayeka had finished her chores and walked towards the Shrine where she 
saw her brother  
Lord Katsuhito, and an adult Washu sweeping the shrine courtyard.  
"Brother , Miss Washu, can I ask for a favor?" Asked Ayeka. 
"Well what do you want Ayeka?" asked Washu. 
"Is there a way to call my parents on Jurai?" 
"Yes, but we'll have to wait for dinner, and Tenchi can open my lab.  
He can give you specific access to a terminal to call your parents. 
Will that do Ayeka?" 
"Yes, oh thank you  Miss Washu!" she nodded at both and headed back 
towards her labor.  
She then motioned her brother to her.  
"Brother" Ayeka motioned Katsuhito to stand next to her.  
"Take care of her brother,be as patient as I will have to be with 
Ryoko." 
"I will Ayeka, I think I still have some of my heart left to allow that 
love to flourish."  
He took his sisters hands and squeezed them lovingly.  
"Thank you for your concerns Ayeka, and If you need to talk, I'll be 
here. all right sister?" 
"Yes, I will keep that in mind. Thank you brother. Will you be back for 
lunch or dinner?" 
"Inform Sasami that we'll be there for dinner. And since you three are 
now together,  
you will all be here for training, Inform your fianc‚s." 
"Yes, brother we will be up after lunch."  
She nodded said her good byes and headed back down to the house. 
Washu came over to a now young Yousho and asked;  
"Do you think they can make it to Saturday?" 
I think that Tenchi is stronger than he looks,...  but it will take all 
that strength  
to keep those two from driving him mad." Answered Yousho. 
Washu cackled as she went back to work as Yousho smiled, and started to 
sweep as well.

Back on Jurai: 
Sister, Don't you think it's time to visit the children? 
Yes That would be fun. I hope to talk to Yousho and Washu about some 
concerns I have. 
And I want to see if my girls are happy and healthy. 
Sister, be truthful. You want to see who got Tenchi! 
Both nodded and laughed as arrangements were made for their trip to 
visit the earth.  
Then an aide came up to the Queens and said; 
"Lady Misaki, the transports are ready." 
"When will we arrive? asked Funaho. 
"We should make it there in 5 days, by Saturday morning." replied the 
aide. 
"Oh I can hardly wait!" Said Misaki 
It will be good to see them. Replied Funaho (Because I feel that 
something has happened  
and we need to get there to help.) she thought as their craft were made 
ready.
