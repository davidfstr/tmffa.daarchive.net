The Mysterious Visitor Part 2
December 21, 2000


I was jarred awake by Ryoko.
	"Time to wake up Gray Fox. You got forty-five minutes till 
breakfast." Ryoko said.
	"Ok Ryoko I will be there." I said to her. When she left I 
liad on the bed for about five minutes. Then I got up to get 
dressed after I got dressed
I left the room only to get stopped at the door by Ryoko.
	"Uh, Hello Ryoko. What can I do for you." I asked her.
She just stood there and stared at me. I just walked around her 
and left her standing there. When I got down stairs I saw Sasami 
in the kitchen with Ryo-ohki on her head. Kiyone, Mihoshi, 
Nobuyuki, Tenchi, and Ayeka were sitting in the living room 
watching T.V. so I sat down with them.
After a while Sasami said that breakfast was ready. When we 
began to go to the table all of a sudden I saw Ryoko phase into 
her seat.
	"Ryoko I said not to use your powers while Gray Fox was 
staying with us." Tenchi yelled.
	"Tenchi, hold on, dont worry about it because I know about 
her powers already." I told Tenchi.
Everyone looked stuned at me then I decided that I should show 
them my powers. I phased into my seat then they looked even more 
stuned even Ryoko looked stuned.
	"I got these from an experiment Washuu had performed on me 
in the acadamy along time ago." I told everyone. After ten 
minutes everyone finally started to move. Breakfast went by very 
quickly. Before I knew it Tenchi was getting up to go train.
	"Tenchi, your grandfather asked me to train with you." I 
said.
	"Ok get ready." Said Tenchi.
I went to my room to get two doses of quick healing peptide.and 
left to train.
When we had gotten to the shrine we had to choose swords for 
training. During training me and Tenchi were almost a close 
match. After about an hour we needed to take a break. At that 
time I had a gash on my left leg just below the knee and it was 
bleeding somewhat heavy. Tenchi had a large cut on his right arm 
and it was bleeding but not that much. Yosho had seen our wounds 
and told us that was enough for the day. Before we left I had 
injected the quick healing peptide and my gash was gone in an 
instant. Tenchi asked me if he could have some I said yes then 
injected him.
After a second his cut was gone. On both the areas where our 
wounds were the blood still remained but that was washed off 
when we got back to the house. After me and Tenchi were done 
washing up it was lunch time.
After lunch everyone left the table and I helped Sasami with the 
dishes.
I decided to find everyone. They were all in the living room and 
then Ryoko  said,
	"Gray Fox can you tell us more about Chirstmas."
	"Ok, Chistmas is a day that in America everyone exchanges 
gifts with friends and family. Before we get the gifts we get a 
pine tree to put in the living room and decorate it with 
ornaments and lights."

Everyone decided it was a good idea and wanted to do it. Tenchi 
and I decided to get a tree. We found one and cut it down to 
bring to the house. After we got the tree in the stand it was 
time to eat dinner. After we ate Tenchi, Washuu, and I had 
decided to go to town to get decorations for the tree, I had 
payed for everything with an infinite debit card I had recived 
from Majestic Twelve. When we got everyone helped decorating the 
tree even Ryo-ohki helped. After we finished it was time for 
dinner. By then it was eight o'clock. After we ate we decided 
that we would go for gifts tomorrow. By nine-thirty I decided to 
visit Washuu. When I got down to her lab she was working on an 
experiment.
	"What are you working on, Washuu." I asked.
	"Nothing really just working to see how you got Ryoko's 
powers during that experiment I peformed on you." Washuu said.
	"Ok what do you know so far."
	"I think that I had set up the warp coil and the plasma 
nacells opposite of the plasma core and that caused an overload 
of the electrical current and that is why you had recieved those 
mutagenic powers."
	"Can you tell me what you mean in laymans terms."
	"Ok, the machine was set wrong so you got your powers. 
Simple enough."
	"Yes Washuu, thank you."
I left the lab to go to my room but as soon as I left the lab I 
was greeted by Tenchi.
	"Gray Fox, I need to ask you a favor." Tenchi said.
	"Ok what is it." I said.
	"I need help on what to get the girls."
	"It is very simple Tenchi I think I can help you."
	"Ok what do I get."
	"For Washuu get her something like a chocolate computer, 
she might like it. For Ayeka and Ryoko get them boxes of 
chocolates. For Mihoshi, get a teddy bear. Sasami, I don't know 
but she might like a new dress. For Kiyone get some new clothes 
for her. And for Ryo-ohki get the biggest carrot in the field 
and wrap it in a ribbon."
	"What about you."
	"Surprise me. Ok."
	"Ok Gray Fox. Goodnight."
	"Goodnight Tenchi. See you tomorrow."
	"Ok, but before you leave what are you getting for 
everyone."
	"You will see at Christmas. Now goodnight."
	"Ok."
Tenchi left and then I went to my room to go to sleep and to be 
well rested for the long walk tomorrow.
