Techni & Ryoko: Forever Dreams Prologue:


Tenchi woke the sounds of explosions by the lake.
"What on earth are those two doing at 1 o'clock in the morning?"  asked
Tenchi rather annoyed.

Outside, Ayeka and Ryoko were having yet another one of there many fights
over Tenchi.  This time, Ayeka  had caught Ryoko in Tenchi's room and as
usual, threw one of her fits.

"And what were YOU doing in there princess?  Hmm?" asked Ryoko slyly.

"That is none of your concern, but if you must know, I was trying to protect
him from monster people like you."

"Taken a look in the mirror lately your royal pain?"

Ayeka looked stung at this comment from Ryoko and attacked using her logs.
Having no time to escape, Ryoko had to take the full force of the blow.  Her
screams could be heard in Tokyo.
Tenchi walked out on to the balcony of his room (which had been added by
Washu after one of Ayeka and Ryoko's fights inside the house) and yelled as
loud as he could to the girls.  His crys were drown out though by one of
Ryoko's energy blasts impacting a nearby tree.
After the blast subsided, Tenchi could finally be heard.

"Will you two give it a rest, I'm suprised the rest of the house isn't
awake!"

The logs around Ayeka and Ryoko's now fully charged energy saber dissipated.
However, they still glared electricity at eachother.  A sweatdrop appeared
on
Tenchi's head.
Ryoko was the first to break the stare.  She simply shrugged and teleported
on top of the roof to watch the stars and moon.
Ayeka stood angrily watching the spot where Ryoko had dissapeared.  'That
woman can be so selfish it's absolutely unbelievable!'  Ayeka turned and saw
Tenchi walking back into his room.

"Oh Lord Tenchi, I am so sorry about this, she can be so incompitent
sometimes."

"Well...." Tenchi studdered.

Ayeka hung her head and walked through the front door.

Tenchi slumped on his bed, with his head in his hands. He thought about how
annoying the girls could be sometimes.  But then he couldn't imagine life
without them nowadays.
Then another thought struck his mind, 'Why was Ryoko giving up so easily
lately?  She seemed so preoccupied.'

Ryoko sat on the roof of the Masaki residence, watching a meteor shower.
She
 heard a creak on the roof, without even looking she knew it was her mother.

"What do you want MOM?" she said very sarcastically.

Washu winced,"Can't a mother watch a meteor shower with her daughter?"

"Whatever!"

Washu tried to search her daughter's mind for some kinda of reason for her
strange behavior lately but it was as if Ryoko were blocking her.
This upset Washu greatly.

"You might as well quit trying, I'm not gonna tell you."  stated Ryoko, now
aware of what her mother was trying to do.

Washu looked very hurt, but, went on her usual way of trying to make
conversation with her only human daughter.
"Honestly, what is so wrong with telling your mother about what is bothering
you.  No one's gonna think any less of you.  You are really starting to act
like a 14 year old.

"Well why can't I?  You're posing as a 12-year-old!"

"Good point"  Washu actually smiled at this.

"Something is just bothering me and i would like to work it out by myself.
If
you don't mind, please stay out of my mind for a while."

Washu looked a little upset, but accepted what her daughter requested. "As
you wish." and with that, Washu left Ryoko to herself.

Ryoko teleported through the roof to her room, and went to bed. Little did
she know, someone was waiting for her in the shadows, giggling.

******************************************************************************

****
(The Next Morning)
Tenchi got half way down the stairs and heard an earpiercing scream coming
from Ryoko's room. He fell the rest of the way, laying on the floor in
complete shock.
Sasami walks into the hall from the kitchen and stares down at Tenchi.

Ryoko comes flying out of her room screaming the only name that came to her
mind, AYEKA!!!!!!
Sasami then looked up and started to giggle at the space pirate, covered in
fake spider webs and now rather than having cyan blue hair, it was now neon
orange.

"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE LAUGHING AT!?" yelled Ryoko to the little
princess.  Rather than be intimidated, she stared to giggle louder.

At that point Washu dashed out of her lab only to come face to face with a
furious Ryoko.  "Oh my little Ryoko, what happened to you?  Were you in my
lab again last night?"

"Where is Ayeka?" Ryoko asked desperately trying to keep under her burning
rage under control.

Ayeka could not help herself, 'What a wonderful way to wake up, to the
sounds
of frustration of her number one rival.'  Ayeka could not help herself, she
grabbed a camera she had just bought and was prepared to take some pictures.
"This will taunt her forever.  Teach her a lesson about making me look like
a
fool infront of Tenchi.

Just then, the door to Ayeka's room exploded off it's hinges from the force
of Ryoko's foot coming in contact with it.
Ayeka stared at the ranting pirate and could only laugh harder.

"YOU ARE SO DEAD PRINCESS!!" Cried Ryoko as she powered up her energy blade.
Just then Ryo-ohki jumped upon Ryoko's shoulder and started to hiss loudly
at
the princess.  Ayeka was starting to feel a little uncommfortable under the
angered stares of the two former pirates.

"TENCHI HELP" cried Ayeka who came catapulting out of her room just ahead of
an energy blast.
Upon reaching the bottom of ther stairs, Ayeka tripped over the still
unconcious Tenchi.  Instantly, Ryoko was upon her.  Energy sword in hand,
she
looked like a cat who had just captured it's prey.
Just before Ryoko brought the blade down upon Ayeka, Washu stood infront of
her.

"Get out of the way Washu."

"Pardon me young lady?"

"Fine, out of the way MOM"

Washu shrugged her shoulders satisfied and moved.

"MISS WASHU!" screamed a now terrified Ayeka, she had never seen Ryoko this
mad before.

"What, this is your fault, get yourself out of it."  shrugged Washu, "by the
way, it's LITTLE WASHU, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU PEOPLE!"

"Ok, little washu!"  Ryoko said saracastically.

"Not you, you may call me mom, mother, ma, mommy, take your pick."

Ryoko sighed and looked down at Ayeka.  Finally this would all be over, her
constant nagging and chasing after Tenchi.  Then, rather unexpectedly, Ryoko
just disappeared.
Ayeka sat shocked.  'What had just happened?' was the thought that coursed
through her mind.

"Ayeka, that was a really mean thing you did to Ryoko." said Sasami.
Ayeka looked down, rather ashamed, at her little sister.  She was right
after
all.

"You really should apologize."  said Sasami again.

"APOLOGIZE TO HER! YOU MUST BE KIDDING!" shreaked Ayeka, this seemed to
bring
Tenchi back to his senses.

"Yeah, you should," said Tenchi.

"I suppose, for you Tenchi."  Ayeka smiled sweetly.

Tenchi sighed, "Not for me, for Ryoko."

Washu mind-linked with her daughter, 'Come to my lab and we will be able to
get that out of your hair in no time.'

'I'd rather leave it in than go to your lab.'

'Then leave it in, see if I care, I was just trying to help.'

'Sheesh, can't you take a joke, you're so gullible, i can't stand this
color,
I'll be there, right now!'
