Ryoko slowly passed through the Juarian gardens. Making sure 
everything was growing beautifully. She wore Juarian robes like 
Tsunami's. She was a little worried about leaving Miko with Misaki. 
Just her hugs alone could kill a person. She took her mind off the 
matter by trying to feel as content as possible in the garden. Yosho 
had to go to a meeting with Azusa. Azaka and Kamidake slowly followed 
behind (in human form)  her. Ryoko looked over to see a tree to rest 
by.
As she sat down to feel the cool shade run along her face she 
noticed that this was the spot where her and Yosho meet. She had been 
climbing the tree and fell from the branch. Yosho came to help her when 
he saw her fall. She softly giggled as she remembered how she reacted. 
He gave her a flower that would help the pain a little. Those days held 
such gentle memories that she would always remember. A sigh slowly 
escaped from her lips.
"Ryoko! Ryoko where are you!?!" a little girl called. Ryoko got 
up and turned to see little 6 year old Sasami. She ran up to the women 
and gasped for breath. Ryoko bent down to the little princess. "Is it 
time for my cooking lessons?" She asked pleadingly. Ryoko chuckled. 
"Sure Sasami. Today it shall be making a juarian dessert." Sasami's 
little face light up with joy. She took Ryoko's hand and tried to pull 
her to the royal kitchen for her lessons.

Tenchi walked through the doorway of the living room to find that 
Ayeka was on the floor in a trance. He ran over to see what was wrong. 
He shook her lightly. "Ayeka. Miss Ayeka." Tenchi said. She shook her 
head a couple of times and looked at him. "Lord Tenchi your home 
early." She whispered as if nothing happened. He got to his feet. "No 
one was at the shrine. I was going to see Washu and see if she could 
find him." She looked around. She was about to say that she saw Yosho 
earlier but decided against it. Tenchi walked towards the lab door only 
to have it smack right in his face. Everyone came downstairs from the 
doors contact with Tenchi and the wall. 
"Has anyone seen Ryoko our Lord Katsuhito?" She asked. This time 
though she looked serious. Her eyes looked like they were redder than 
Ryoko's gems. Everyone shook their head except Ayeka. Washu really 
didn't notice. "Well there missing. And a few minutes ago I got a time 
travel reading over my readings and it seems that those two have gone 
back in time." She cried.
Tenchi slipped from behind the door. "Washu do you mean like what 
happened with my mother?" Tenchi asked. "Exactly Tenchi. But they 
aren't going back to that. They went 6 years after Sasami's birth. They 
had just been married. /sniff/ and there baby was born two months ago. 
They went back to a time that they lived happily." Washu slipped to the 
floor with a dazed look. "Washu do you mean that Ryoko and Yosho were 
married?" Kiyoni asked. Washu nodded sadly. Tenchi looked as if lost in 
her words. How could his own grandfather take his Ryoko away from him 
when he was almost ready to tell her, that that.....

"Okay Sasami you sprinkle only a little sugar into the jelly." 
Ryoko whispered. Sasami looked at the women as she slowly stirred the 
jelly. Sasami took a teaspoon and pulled out some sugar. Ryoko just 
nodded and she sprinkled it into the jelly. Ryoko gave the jelly to the 
little princess to stir while she pulled out the steamed flower petals 
of a juarian cherry. The pedals were eatable and good with desserts. 
She called Sasami over to get a plate to set them on. As Ryoko set the 
pedals down so they looked like miniature bowls, Sasami prepared the 
jelly. Ryoko couldn't help but smile as the girl did this. 
Sasami slowly placed a teaspoon of jelly in each little pedal. 
Ryoko followed behind with some sprinkles and cherries. After every 
thing was placed carefully in place, it was finished. As they took off 
there cooking aprons Yosho walked in. He kissed Ryoko on the cheek and 
hugged Sasami. "Hello there honey. Look we made your favorite." She 
giggled as she put up the aprons in the closet. "Oh, it seems that you 
have. Just for old time sake can I have one now?" He asked as Sasami 
tried pushing him away from the counter. Ryoko was delighted and 
content about her home and family and no matter what happened she 
wasn't going to be separated from them. 'I love you. Yosho.' She 
thought to herself seeing that Yosho tried to get a peace of dessert.
