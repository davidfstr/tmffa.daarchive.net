DARKNESS & LIGHT - No Need For Kova
By Zyraen

CHAPTER X : No Need for Recovery

The green haired detective roused herself as she heard her partner call. "I have to
go now, Kova-chan." She quickly removed the arm he had laid over her shoulders,
and stood up.

"And I have to return to my ship soon, too." He also made to stand up as she ran
out of the room heading for the bridge. Smiling a little to himself, the ache in his
body diminished but still there, he opened a small portal and pulled several things
out of it. The largest one he placed on her headrest behind her pillow, and the rest
beneath her pillow, piled neatly on top each other. He smiled wistfully to himself,
then the rift enlarged and he stepped through.

    ===========================================================

"What’s the problem, Mihoshi?"

Even as she asked, she saw the radar’s red dot draw nearer, and through the glass
in the distance Kiyone beheld a large shadow moving towards them.

"Oh no."

    ===========================================================

"Solar reading Comet, over."

"Solar! What happened!?"

"Me and Stellar got EMP blasted. Stellar will recover an estimated ten minutes from
now. Blast magnitude 37969591 Tera Teslawaves. Advise Comet to erect an
effective EMP shield."

"WHAT? We can’t do that! Such a massive EMP blast, we need more time."

"Never mind. Prototype Solar awaiting instructions. Permission to open fire, sir?"

"Negative. Wait till Stellar recovers before you give yourself away. And
remember…"

"Sir?"

"Shoot to kill."

    ===========================================================

Well well well. Just as I thought.

He grinned to himself, as the Shuriken drew nearer to the enemy ship. 

It was the Syndicate all along.

His finger lit on the switch to the Tachyon Ray, and paused there.

I’d destroy it for sure. Yet, it was configured to annihilate one or two planets, its
scope would be… half of the Solar System, at least. Saturn and Jupiter would be
destroyed, while Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would sustain heavy scarring. The
debris of the planets would pose a danger to Earth.

Besides, I need to know specifically who’s behind all this.

Could it be?

He shook the thought out of his head.

Man, am I getting paranoid. Besides, I’d better get Sasami and the Blaster back first

    ===========================================================

Kiyone’s face appeared on board Ryo-oh-ki.

"Ryoko, Aeka, Washu!"

The scientist, lost in her work, did not respond, and the two girls did not pay her
any attention.

"Synera Syndicate ship approaching, likely hostile!" Kiyone shouted again, only to
see no reaction. "Rrrrgh….!" She growled. "WILL YOU PEOPLE LISTEN UP!!!!"

Ryoko and Aeka glanced over their shoulders, both looking rather annoyed.

"There’s a BATTLESHIP approaching!"

"Miya!" Ryo-oh-ki added, as if to confirm her words.

"Ryo-oh-ki, handle it yourself. And don’t jostle too much." Ryoko commanded, then
turned away.

Kiyone gritted her teeth in frustration as the transmission was cut off.

"Relax, Kiyone, Ryo-oh-ki can handle it." Mihoshi said soothingly.

Kiyone glared at her. "Will you just look at that thing, Mihoshi!" She pointed at the
ship looming closer. Mihoshi stared a while longer, then her eyes widened as she
made out the cannons and lasers peeking out from beneath the armoured surface,
and the ring of metal about it encased it in a thick defensive shield.

"Oh…" She put her finger to her mouth. "Not so easy, huh?"

The two detectives watched as the hulking ship slowed to a halt by the light red
craft, its form bristling with offensive weapons.

"Incoming transmission, from Synera Syndicate Ship Comet." The Yagami
announced, and a face flashed on the screen.

"Greetings, resident officers of Earth and the Solar System." A genial, balding man
looked at them, with a thinning beard and a toothless smile. Kiyone and Mihoshi
stared at each other, shocked speechless. "Thank you for subduing the two rogue
space shuttles that have been hijacked by pirates within the system. We request
permission to board them and deal with culprits responsible for this incident. I
hope it will not be too inconvenient."

Kiyone shook her head. "It will be okay to board the ships, but the inhabitants are
likely hostile."

"Rest assured, officer, we have enough men to subdue them, and none shall
escape the sword of justice, for be it Galaxy Police or Syndicate courts, we abide by
the rules of the Galactic Law." His voice was soothing, not honeyed nor
compromising, but polite, cordial and formal. "Please, we are requesting
permission now." The voice became just a little more firm. "Diplomatically."

Kiyone blinked.

Could it be this ship truly is not the enemy?

But Kova had said they were hunting him, they wanted the weapons…

And she was going to take the word of a space pirate and spy against the word of a
ship captain in the Syndicate forces? Plus they were being diplomatic, meaning if
this erupted into a battle, the blame would be on her, and her only, unless they had
initiated the attack.

Desperately her mind rove through the Galactic Law articles that would lend
enough weight to her case and enable her to reject the ‘diplomatic request’. That
those two ships were clearly theirs did not make it any better for her cause.

"I am sorry, but one of the ships has delicate documents containing classified
information, meant only for the eyes of the Galaxy Police. Besides, I have a warrant
for the capture of the men on board."

"Rest assured, we will turn over any foreign articles and captors that you may
request for your case, detective. We only seek to recover our ships and to
administer justice." The old man’s brown eyes flashed a little warningly, though his
tone was still cool and composed.

"I am sorry, Captain, but I must insist the space ships remain under my jurisdiction."

The beard twitched a little. "Very well, the Galaxy Police will contact you soon. I
trust you will obey your Headquarters, detective. Please transmit your approval
when you have decided." He bowed slightly. "We graciously wait on your decision."
The transmission flickered and went out.

Kiyone and Mihoshi both breathed a sigh of relief.

    ===========================================================

Washu removed the goggles, wiped her brow and caught her breath. The endless
stream of data the computer had been chewing through stopped flowing. Running
her fingers over the keyboard, she checked the data. "Layer check - all in. Now to
clear the blood in his lungs…"

    ===========================================================

After some five minutes, the doors slid open and a Teranium cyborg emerged,
holding Sasami under its arm.

"Let me go!" The little princess squealed, but the cyborg paid her no attention, just
trudged down the passage on his own. Just as they went around the corner, an
azure scythe descended without warning from around the corner and sliced into
the cyborg, splitting it into two halves from the head down. Sasami stared in
surprise, as the spy stood before her, his expression tense. He was no longer
wearing his ragged clothing, but was dressed in a night blue, almost black, body
tight battlesuit like Ryoko’s, with dashes of really thin blood red streaks
damascened on and running down from his shoulders to his knees, like bloody
lightning streaking out of a night sky.

"Say you love Jurai or die!" Kova ordered.

The little princess looked at him curiously, scratching her head, seemingly unaware
of the metal robot forming back together beside her.

He took a deep breath. "Die, spawn of Jurai!" Sasami froze with fear as he charged,
the blue blade screaming towards her tresses. 

And dived over her head.

"What the…?" A soulless metallic voice exclaimed. Kova was already behind her as
a red laser whip materialised in her hand, held horizontally with both hands above
her head to ward off his blow, then rolled to his feet with his back to the cyborg.
The scythe twirled around him in a dazzling arc as the Sasami impostor lashed out
futilely, then he spun around and jumped back as an explosion tore through the air
between he and his foe. Using the blast to propel himself onward down the
corridor, he landed catlike on his feet and ran as the smoke cleared behind him,
fighting not to give in to the dull pain in his calf. He just managed to make it around
another corner before another burst of crimson erupted behind from the passage
he just left.

The door to the bridge was in sight…

His weapon flew in a dazzling cerulean path before him, detonating upon impact
with the door to the bridge. Emerald beams streaked out over the broken remnants
of the door at chest and stomach level, and he slid forwards with his body leaning
back, like a man sliding for a base. Half a second later he rolled sideways as the
cyborg saw through the smoke and aimed for the ground, perforating the floor just
bare inches from his head and temple, as his scythe swept at the cyborg. The thing,
an arm held tight around an unconscious Sasami, evaded the sweep by hurling
itself to the side, still firing with its other arm appendage.

Damned! I have no way of separating Sasami from it!

He ignored the shrieks of protests from his shoulder as he spun on his upper back
and jumped to his feet. The scythe transformed back into a silver rod as green
beams coruscated off the surface of his blue shields, and his arms were mere blurs
of motion protecting his body as he lunged directly towards the Solvarium cyborg.

The Teranium cyborg that had just arrived in the doorway watched as he flew
towards its ally, his shield shimmering cyan as the blasts were absorbed. It quickly
hurled a scarlet ball of energy in his direction.

Kova smiled as he glimpsed the crimson out of the corner of his eye.

I pray this works.

The silver rod sailed between the legs of the Solvarium cyborg and opened a
portal behind it, before changing back into a scythe. Kova reached out for scythe
as it returned, slicing off the cyborg’s firing arm along the way, and turned to face
the streaking ball of explosive energy. 

For a fraction of a split second, Terminus glimpsed Kova, body half in mid air,
facing it and its deadly scarlet sphere, with laser shields and twirling scythe held
out before him, protecting Sasami and himself from the blast. Behind him, there
was Stellar, with one arm gone, the other arm gripping the Juraian princess tightly,
and worst of all, with the back to the portal.

Oh no.

Terminus just registered this thought as the projectile struck Kova’s shield.

HAHA! The spy grinned as the force of the explosion combined with his momentum
slammed him into the Solvarium cyborg and Sasami, hurling all three of them
through the subspace rift.

    ===========================================================

"Huh?" Ryoko and Aeka looked around as they heard what sounded like half an
explosion, and watched in astonishment as a cyborg, Sasami then Kova tumbled
out into the Ryo-oh-ki’s bridge.

The spy, keeping his head despite the circumstances, tossed himself off Stellar
before the cyborg’s arm grew back, as the rest of its body shrunk a little in
compensation. "Get Sasami!" He yelled to the two girls as a beam skimmed by his
back.

Washu didn’t look up from her work, though her eyebrows twitched in frustration.

A green laser sword stabbed at Kova’s side, but he managed to fend it off. Ryoko
appeared beside the cyborg, orange blade slashing, but the thing parried again.

"Don’t give it a chance, or it will hold Sasami hostage!" Kova yelled, fending off his
weakness and pain as he and Ryoko pressed the enemy hard. His legs were
scarred by the blast, and his body ached with fatigue and weariness, while there
seemed to be lacerations all over his body, not to mention his wounds in his calf
and shoulder.

Aeka was standing where she had sat, wondering what to do – her force field and
Guardians all had an area effect damage, so she dare not join the fight for fear of
hurting her sister. 

"Aeka, get the Solvarium formula!" His scythe deflected a beam from the other arm
carrying Sasami, for the palm was free to face him.

"Miyaa!" Ryo-oh-ki shrilled in pain and annoyance as the laser ricocheted off and
struck the walls of the spaceship.

The princess paused for a moment, wondering which spray was which, before she
grabbed them both.

Stellar watched the sparks of cyan and yellow as it continued to parry its opponents
attacks, its other hand occasionally flashing out beams when a foe was in sight.

This will not do!! Besides, I am only required to assist Terminus, and not Satellite,
and the princess objective has been relegated to second…

Kova’s scythe and shield went off as the cyborg hurled the princess at him, and the
spy just managed to catch her with both hands as his silver rod fell to the floor.
Both arms now freed, the cyborg struck once at Ryoko, who parried, before
unleashing a series of blasts at the pirate. Ryoko instinctively dodged them, as
Stellar raised a foot and kicked Kova in stomach, just under Sasami and his solar
plexus.

"Oooof!" Kova grunted as he slid away from them, due to the force of the cyborg’s
strike, his body contorting in agony.

"Sasami!" Aeka streaked at the cyborg, her azure force field bearing down on the
robot, which bent and rolled, arm making out for the rod, its only hope back to its
ship. Kova stretched out a hand and the android cursed as the rod flew towards
him, just before Aeka’s force field struck its side, severing its upper shoulder and
newly formed arm. Seizing her opportunity as the cyborg staggered back, Aeka
sprayed the severed Solvarium metal with both formulas, which became inanimate.

Accursed wench!

The cyborg fired with its one remaining arm at Ryoko while charging towards
Washu in an effort to capture at least one hostage. The scientist glanced up briefly,
fury flaming in her eyes.

Stellar crackled for a moment with pink energies as he struck her shield, then
bounced off.

"Hey!" Ryoko exclaimed, as the flailing cyborg slammed into Ryo-oh-ki’s wall and
vanished. "What the…!" She approached the wall.

Kova looked up as Aeka tried to revive Sasami who was on his lap, although his
stomach smarted rather badly and he had to sit down. "Ryoko, careful!"

Ryoko vanished as the wall unleashed a salvo of green lasers, and the scientist
frowned in anger or distraction as her shield shimmered rose. "Aeka! Forget
Sasami, protect Washu!" Ryoko ordered.

Already Washu’s shield was weakening under the onslaught, turning a little white.
Kova hurled his scythe at the wall as Aeka quickly ran for Washu. The surface of
Ryo-oh-ki’s inside seemed to ripple as the Solvarium cyborg made off.

"Miya…!?" Ryo-oh-ki said, as the scythe arced towards the wall.. "MIYA!!"

Kova quickly reached out his hand and the scythe arced back without striking
Ryo-oh-ki.

Ryoko quickly signalled a gem. "Here, Ryo-oh-ki." She quickly dumped some red
hot peppers into it.

"MIYA!" Ryo-oh-ki roared in fury and rage. "MIIIIIIYYYYAAAAAAAA!!!" Almost
savagely.

The ship’s insides turned a light scarlet as its outside turned crimson.

"There he is!" Ryoko shouted at the patch of dark grey against pink on the floor,
just some ten metres from Washu and Aeka. The cyborg, realising it was found,
quickly blasted Washu, but Aeka interposed herself between them.

"Sorry again, Ryo-oh-ki." An orange plasma beam hurtled through the air and
exploded as it struck the patch.

"*MIYAA!*" Ryo-oh-ki screamed in anger and pain. "*MIYA!*"

Aeka rushed in and sprayed both formulas in the air as some droplets fell down,
then on the floor where those she had missed were coalescing together.

"Whew." Kova let out a sigh of relief. The adrenaline left his body and he felt his
hurts return to haunt him. "Man, I hurt." He massage his stomach carefully.

Aeka hurried over to Sasami, while Washu continued her work as though nothing
had happened, although her face was still very cross.

    ===========================================================

At about the time when Kova had left the false Sasami around the corner…

"Section Chief!?" Kiyone and Mihoshi exclaimed in wide eyed surprise.

"Yes indeed, 2nd Class Chief Inspectors Kiyone and Mihoshi." He agreed. "I have
news for you two. The Comet has requested permission to board the disabled SSS
shuttles, so have you agreed?"

"Erm.. well.. no." Kiyone mumbled.

"Why?"

"Princess Sasami and a weapon from the Science Academy are on board those
shuttles. If the Synereans get their hands on those two, it could spell disaster for
Jurai and for us Galaxy Police too." Kiyone replied.

The section chief frowned, thinking. "Very well, then. I do not recommend you
outrightly tell him about these, but just refuse, saying you have not received
approval from HQ. As for us, we’ll try to stall them."

Mihoshi beamed and Kiyone smiled. "Anything else, Section Chief?"

"Yes indeed. It has come to my attention a certain criminal is on the loose in the
vicinity of the Solar System." Mihoshi looked surprised and Kiyone managed to
hide her inner fears. "The SSS is very intent on capturing this person, and the
Science Academy dean has verified the need to capture or kill this dangerous
being, although he insisted no one is to know except the officers in charge of this."
His eyes ran over the two officers before him. "His name is Kova Kashiro."

Mihoshi felt sweat bead on her brow, and stared at Kiyone. 

Kova Kashiro…Kiyone’s boyfriend… a space criminal!!

To her surprise, her friend was acting as though nothing was wrong.

"Yes, sir! However I have a special request - in the event this can be resolved
peacefully, what should I do to him?"

"Chief Inspector Kiyone, I have reason to believe such a compromise will be a
pretense, a sham." The chief looked very sombre. "He is a spy and a criminal, and
both records and reports have it that he is utterly untrustworthy. If he makes any
pact or attempts to parley with you, be wary, officer."

Kiyone’s heart sank within her. "If I can somehow secure his pledge of goodwill or
capture him, what am I to do with him?"

"Report with him in custody through transmission. Then send him to the Synera
Syndicate. They have requested he be sent to them either unconscious and
restrained or dead. Once the Syndicate has received him, you will receive your due
awards."

"Awards?" Kiyone and Mihoshi exclaimed together.

"Yes. I understand it will be a dangerous assignment, given the sophisticated
technology the villain has at his disposal. His files also indicate an astonishingly
high number of kills, considering he was a normal person with mediocre equipment
at his fingertips previously. I have chosen the two of you because of your record in
defeating Kagato and that you have allies of great resource, people like Washu and
Tenchi, the hero of Jurai."

"Could we… discuss the terms of his capture?" Kiyone pleaded, sounding a little
nervous.

"There isn’t much room for discussion, anyway it can be done after you all have
subdued the said criminal. Good luck for your assignment, Chief Inspectors. If you
wish to request Special Forces back up, feel free to do so." The face went offline.

Mihoshi regarded her partner with concern in her eyes Kiyone sank limply into her
chair, her face distraught. "Kiyone…?"

"Mihoshi." She sighed. "What am I going to do…?" Her head tilted back as her
hands went over her eyes. "*What* am I going to do!?"

Mihoshi looked oddly at her. Kiyone had been distressed before during the times
they spent together, but she had never, ever asked Mihoshi for help.

"There now, Kiyone, you’ll think of something…"

"This is so *stupid*!" She growled to herself. "Maybe I should just end it…"

No, it wasn’t so easy. Her parents both had been in the GP Special Forces, and she
had been in every way, a GP person. To turn her back on her job was to turn her
back on something of herself, something that she had always been…

Kova then… but she had given him everything she could possibly have, and so had
he, except themselves. Not just in terms of making love, but they both had refused
to stop being what they were, though they would change a little to accommodate
each others feelings, but other than that…

"Mi…hoshi…?" Her voice trembled, as her head sank into her hands.

"Yes, Kiyone?" Mihoshi was not feeling very happy either, but she tried her best to
hide it and sound her usual cheerful self.

"Do you… really think I should… give him up?"

"I really don’t know, Kiyone." She tried to keep her voice strong, for her partner’s
sake. "Even if you do give him up, could you…" Delicacy never was a strong point
with Mihoshi, but nevertheless she searched for a delicate way to put it. "…do all
that to him?"

"Then the Galaxy Police…?"

Mihoshi gave a long, deep sigh, and her expression dimmed. Fortunately Kiyone
was not looking up, so she did not notice how much her simple question affected
her bubbly companion. "Kiyone, if you really want to, I’m okay."

Catching the poignancy in her voice, Kiyone peered up at her partner. Mihoshi
stared back, her blue eyes melancholy.

Reminds me of Kova…

And with that thought, some things started to fall into place… 

"Mihoshi?"

"I’ll be fine, really…" Mihoshi smiled, rather weakly. "You… just go ahead." A pause.
"But only if you really want to…" Mihoshi tried to blink back her tears. "…because
you really are one of us…"

Kiyone watched her partner, too touched for words, as Mihoshi’s false smile finally
gave out. "Mihoshi, you’re the best." She managed at last.

Mihoshi blinked. "So, are you…?"

"Don’t you worry about it." She stood up and hugged Mihoshi, whose eyes opened
in surprise. "I’ll work something out…" She gently whispered into her ear.

"You always do, Kiyone." Mihoshi’s voice choked with emotion.

"Thanks." Kiyone smiled, though the pensiveness still hung heavily on her face
as she stepped back from her partner. "And you always were the best."

Mihoshi stared hard, as she saw, amidst a mixture of gratefulness and gloominess
in Kiyone’s eyes, pride, strident and clear. For her partner, for Mihoshi.

"Partner." Kiyone had never thought she could mean it to Mihoshi, but somehow it
all made sense to her now.

My life never was in shambles, she realised. Not with Mihoshi around. But because
of me. Because I thought it was. And I never knew what was truly important.

You always knew it, didn’t you, Mihoshi?

Mihoshi continued watching Kiyone in astonishment. Kiyone whose eyes never left
her for a moment, Kiyone whose pride in her never wavered for a moment as she
sat back in her chair. The green haired detective smiled fondly at her partner, her
dilemma forgotten in her moment of revelation, before gently disengaging her gaze
from Mihoshi’s bewildered one.

"You know, Mihoshi, you are the best partner anyone could ever ask for."

    ===========================================================

"Message from Yagami - K3M."

"Message from Yagami - K3M."

Kova wearily picked himself off the floor and went over. "Ryo-oh-ki, put me in to
Yagami."

"…miya…." The cabbit sounded sulky.

"Come on, you!" Ryoko ordered. "Do what the man said!"

"Miya!" Ryo-oh-ki half snarled. Her insides were still glowing pink.

"Whaa…? What happened?" Sasami slowly opened her eyes. She looked up into
dazzling purple eyes filled with joy. "Aeka? Is that really you!?"

Aeka nodded. "Yes, it’s me, Sasami." She embraced her little sister.

"Where’s Tenchi?" Sasami made to get up, failing to notice Aeka’s face turn dull
with fear. "Owww… my head hurts. How did I get here? 

"Tenchi’s… hurt, Sasami." Aeka sighed. "And that …." Space pirate? Spy?
Criminal? "…man over there saved you." Sasami followed her finger as she pointed
at Kova, looking tired and battle worn, beseeching Ryo-oh-ki.

"Why isn’t she listening?" She took in the slightly red surroundings. "What’s wrong
with Ryo-oh-ki?"

"She’s… a little grouchy." Ryoko added, a guilty look on her face.

"Come on, my little space cabbit." Kova was trying vainly to coax the cabbit into
action, and he sounded very tired. "Please…" he sighed. On the screen before him
the message continued flashing.

Sasami looked accusingly at Ryoko. "You did it again, didn’t you?"

"Who, me?" Ryoko gave a look of astonishment.

"Come on, Ryo-oh-ki, put me in through to Kiyone!" Kova was trying harder.

Sasami rummaged around her dress. "I always have a… ah there!" Out popped a
familiar little pointy something. "Now, Ryo-oh-ki, want this?"

"Miya!!" A gem floated over to Sasami, and Kova turned behind to look at her.

"Sasami…?" The spy tried.

"Uh uh, Ryo-oh-ki!" Aeka watched as her little sister, still sitting in her lap, pulled
the carrot away from the gem. "Not until you put this nice man through to Kiyone!"

Kova looked back in surprise as Kiyone’s face appeared on the transmission.

"Kiyone-chan?"

"Kova-chan? What took you so long?" She looked in irritation.

My, he looks good in that battlesuit, only…

"Are you all right? Where did you get those lacerations?" 

"I’m fine…" He discreetly massaged his stomach, hoping Kiyone would not notice.

Then she spotted the two Juraian princesses together. "Is that Sasami over
there?"

"Hi, Kiyone!" The little princess waved, as her other hand dropped the carrot into
the gem. "What happened to Tenchi?" She asked.

Aeka gently steered Sasami in Washu’s direction.

"Tenchi… oh no!" Sasami made out the big block and the boy within, and stood up,
meaning to rush over, as Aeka held on to her dress. 

"Sasami, don’t disturb Washu!" Aeka ordered sharply.

Sasami did not seem to hear, but before she actually ran, she sat back into her
sister’s lap. "Ooooh…" She held her head with both hands. "Owww, I hurt…"

"Sasami, are you all right?" Aeka and Kiyone asked together.

Kova gave the princess he recovered a suspicious stare. "Sasami?"

"Oh…" she leaned back into her sister’s arms. "Aeka, it hurts…"

Kova fought the illogical impulse to scream a warning to Aeka. 

Those androids are making me paranoid. (sorry, I couldn’t resist it)

With an effort, he turned his back on Sasami again. "Kiyone-chan? What is it you
wanted to talk to me about?" He smiled a little.

"You… got Sasami back?" Kiyone asked, as Mihoshi heard her and popped her
head up over Kiyone’s shoulder to see.

He nodded. "I was lucky they were trying to outsmart me, and the rest I made up as I
went along. If all three were in there with Sasami there’s almost no chance I could
get her back."

"Wow!" Mihoshi laughed. "Kiyone’s boyfriend’s a hero! We Galaxy Police owe you
one, Kova!" She stopped suddenly as Kova stared at her meaningfully. "Ur..erm…
What’s wrong?" She turned to face her partner, who was also glaring at her.
"Kiyone..?"

"Mihoshi!" Kiyone’s teeth ground against each other. "Everyone’s listening!!"

"But, I…"

"Relax, you two." Ryoko muttered, a little crossly. "We knew it before this, ain’t big
news anymore." She teleported opposite Washu. "Most of us are more worried
about Tenchi." She gazed longingly at the unconscious boy in the Stasis Block, her
yellow eyes glittering with emotion.

"Well." Kova shrugged off Ryoko’s comment. "What is it?"

Aeka carried Sasami over and sat down nearby, their two pairs of eyes watching
Washu, ignoring the two people conversing with each other.

Kiyone released her partner from her baleful stare. "There’s an SSS ship nearby.
The captain requested that I let them board the two shuttles, which ostensibly have
been hijacked. Can I trust him?"

The spy smiled at her. "So you turned him down. How unexpected."

"Of course I did," Kiyone smacked her head in irritation. "But *can* I trust him?"

"I don’t trust any of them." He paused a little. "But you’re a Galaxy Police Officer,
and anyway, he might be telling the truth." He thought a little again. "Describe the
person."

"A balding old man, with a genial voice and a thinning beard."

Kova’s eyes narrowed. "Whatever he requests, ignore him."

"Anyone you know?" Kiyone probed.

"Nope. Just that the SSS military has very strict rules about uniform. For one thing,
most ship captains are between 28 to 48 years old. Secondly, no one except the
most senior officers are supposed to appear on transmission not in uniform, and
that includes a military cap. Besides, you don’t find senior officers on board these
ships, not unless they’re on a special mission." He looked speculative, as Kiyone
winced at the thought of what other ships could be greater than the one before
them. "In that case, there’s only two possible cases in this system. One would be
capturing the princesses, the other one to capture me. Both makes him our
enemy."

"You know an awful lot about the military of a galactic empire you’ve never lived in,
you know." Kiyone asked. "I wonder why."

"Because it helps me stay alive. I need to know." He gazed at her, seeing a flicker
of uneasiness in her eye. "Kiyone-chan, are you all right? Is there something
troubling you?"

"Kova-chan, I…" She paused, closing her eyes. "HQ contacted me with a new
assignment." Mihoshi blanched as she wondered what would happen when her
partner spilled the beans.

Kova arched his eyebrows. "And what might that be?"

"They…" Kiyone swallowed, and opened her eyes, exhaling slowly. "…ordered me
to apprehend a space criminal." Her voice lowered. "A Kova Kashiro."

There was a long silence.

"After this is over, then." He said, quietly. "I’ll go back to Headquarters with you."

"But they’ll kill you!" Kiyone exclaimed, fear showing through her voice.

"Nope. If things work out the way I hope, they won’t. I might be pardoned." Kova
sounded hopeful, but Kiyone could hear the hollowness in his voice.

"But what about the fifty over ship raids!?"

"I hope to change that." His voice became resolute. "At the very least."

"Actually, I’m supposed to deliver you to the Synera Stellar Syndicate." Kiyone
added, her voice trembling. "Not that they won’t kill you too, eventually."

Kova looked up at her, his face set in certainty. "You won’t do that." Kiyone
watched as the azure pupils seemed to ripple like the surface of two deep lakes. "I
know you won’t."

Kiyone bit her lip, and tears began to well up in her eyes. "Do you want me to…?" 

Kova closed his eyes, feeling his emotions course through him like burning wine.
Exultation, triumph, but there was something else too… 

All I have to do is say it. She’ll do it. I know she will.

But she can’t. It is part of her. It is her.

She can try. Maybe it might work out…

"No." He replied, his voice low and husky. "Don’t do it." 

Once again, the pain of denying oneself streaked         through his being.

How many temptations will I have to turn down? He asked himself. Will they all hurt
so badly?

Kiyone stared at the view screen, where Kova’s eyes watched her every
expression of pain with his very soul peering out through those azure windows.

"Kiyone-chan, you are part of them. It is, and always have been, your life." With a
brittle, bitter smile. "Don’t give up the light to walk in the dark."

"Kova-chan…"

"I am reaching for you, for the light." The smile grew warmer, though the
uncertainty still lingered in his eyes. "Will you guide me? Will you be there, to shield
me from the blinding light?" 

"That I will, Kova-chan…" Kiyone felt her throat constrict with emotion. "I’ll be the
first angel to welcome you."

"I love you." Strangely, he couldn’t remember saying that, before. It had always
seemed an admission of weakness. He savoured the taste of the words on his lips.
"I love you, Kiyone-chan."

"I know." She smiled, tears glittering in her eyes. "And I know you always will."

    ===========================================================

Behind Kova, where the rest had gathered…

"Whew, that was hard." Washu staggered back, tearing off the goggles and gasping
in relief, wiping her brow with her free hand. Then remembering she was not alone,
she broke out into a laughter of triumph that was a little too unnatural. "Nah, not
really! Piece of cake!"

"Is he all right?" Aeka.

"Will he be fine?" Ryoko.

"Tenchi looks like he’s asleep."

"Of course! After all, the greated scientist in the universe has mended his wound,
hasn’t she, hmm?" Washu grinned. Sasami looked a little queerly at her, wondering
why her dolls had not popped up and commented.

"Can you release him from the cell now?" Aeka asked, stroking Sasami’s hair to
comfort herself. 

"Erm, yeah, I guess I could." She tapped some buttons on her computer, and a bed
formed up under the block. "Just a little more…" She fingered her Stasis bracelet,
and the cell began to blink out of existence. "Pray hard, fellas, here goes
nothing…"

    ===========================================================

"Ahh, at last. Stellar, report." He looked at the screen, searching for the third robot.
"Where’s Stellar? And the princess?" 

"I am sorry, my lord. This is Terminus." The robot spoke emotionlessly, with its
counterpart beside it. "Stellar is gone, disabled permanently." He held up a large
piece of Solvarium that had once been the cyborg’s arm. "Princess Sasami is
residing in Ryo-oh-ki now."

"WHAT? Why did you let her get away?"

"The spy Kova tricked us." The cyborg did not feel wise to let Overlord know he
tricked specifically, it. "He opened a portal behind Stellar and rammed it and Sasami
into Ryo-oh-ki."

"How the hell… just one of your legs has a traction of over a three hundred
newtons!!"

"He… had a little help."

Overlord stared at the cyborg, but it remained impassive. "What about the Tachyon
Blaster?"

"Here." Terminus reached into its chest, its hand seeming to melt, then took out
the weapon. "A secondary objective may be faulted on, but never a major
objective."

He stared at the gun and the cyborg. "What the… what if the spy sliced you and
destroyed the Blaster with it!?"

Terminus seemed to shrug. "It was in my lower calf."

"All right, prepare to pull out towards Comet, before they realise you’re freed from
the EMP. The Comet and Solar will open fire to cover you."

"Time?"

Overlord glanced at the view screen, which read - 

‘Time to Absolute Archbeam Armament - 00:02:31’

For the first time since he arrived in this wretched, dilapidated planetary system,
Overlord smiled.

    ===========================================================

Gradually, ever so slowly, light began to pierce the darkness around him. The
shadows reared up, startled, and melted away. Dimly he could make out two heads
around him.

Gold, amethyst and cerulean eyes stared down at him, but somehow his eyelids did
not seem to be open enough yet. Violet tresses intertwined with finer blue ones
hung down, brushing his hand gently, while on the other side, cyan locks curled
around his upper arm and chest.

"..pen…ng!"

"..en…iii.."

"..en…iii.."

Somehow he got the impression he was not using all of his eyes, so he tried to
open them wider, but failed. The sounds gradually got more distinct.

"Tenchi..?"

"Tenchi..?"

If he could move his eyebrows, he would have frowned. Who was that?

"Tenchi…?"

"He’s not moving, Washu!!" Sasami exclaimed.

"Give him some more time." Washu was sitting down, looking away, her fingers
crossed. "He’ll come to fully, soon. After all his heartbeat and everything are
steady." Ensuring that had of course been easy for her. But as for the rest…

"Tenchi, move, do something, anything!" Ryoko half shouted at the figure with the
eyelids barely open.

"Ryoko! Quiet, let lord Tenchi rest! He needs time to recover."

Tenchi. What a nice name, but who was that?

"He’s moving, his eyes are opening more!" Aeka and Ryoko shrieked in delight as
his vision became clearer.

Are they talking about me? Could it be that I am Tenchi?

The features cleared, and he could make out Ryoko and Aeka’s face, bright with joy,
glittering droplets of joy on their cheeks. Standing before Aeka, Sasami seemed
equally ecstatic, too.

"Washu! You did it! Tenchi’s coming to!!"

Tenchi. Sounds familiar now.

Why they’re all looking at me like that? Am I Tenchi?

Tenchi… hmm, Tenchi something…

Tenchi… Masaki! 

Yes, that’s me! Tenchi Masaki!

His lips moved a little, and Ryoko’s heart fluttered as she felt something move her
curls a little. "Tenchi! You’re alive!"

He managed to give a weak, barely noticeable nod of agreement.

"Oh, Lord Tenchi!" Aeka bent and gave him a brief, petite kiss on the cheek. 

Tenchi blinked, suddenly wide awake.

"I’m so glad you’re back!" Then realising what she had inadvertantly done, the
princess’ face turned a rosy pink.

"Oooh, Aeka!!" Sasami chuckled, regarding her blushing sister and Tenchi. "My,
Tenchi must sure like being greeted like that."

Ryoko frowned but swallowed her anger so as not to upset Tenchi. "I welcome you
back too, Tenchi." She put her hand over his and squeezed gently.

Tenchi, Sasami and Aeka all stared at her in shock. Ryoko was acting the way
Aeka should!

Ryoko grinned a little and kissed Tenchi’s hand, rather more gently then she
usually did.

"You know," Tenchi managed, his voice weak and soft but nevertheless amused. "I
think the two of you are beginning to grow on one another." Sasami giggled, and
Tenchi’s soft brown eyes lighted on her. "How did you get back, Sasami?" He
smiled gently at her.

"They tell me he got me back." Sasami turned around, but to her surprise there was
no one in front of the now empty transmission screen. "Hey, where did he go?"

Tenchi reached out weakly to pat Sasami’s hair, but he felt the pain in his chest,
and lay back. "He’s gone, Sasami." He smiled, almost dreamily, looking up at Aeka
and Ryoko. "It sure feels good to see all of you again." Ryoko and Aeka beamed as
he said that.

"What’s his name, Tenchi?" Sasami asked. "I didn’t even get to thank him."

"His name is Kova." Tenchi murmured, still looking at Aeka and Ryoko. "And he is a
good friend of Kiyone’s." His smile broadened as he thought of his next line. "If you
want to thank him, thank Kiyone. She’ll tell him for you."

"Gee, thanks, Tenchi!" Sasami went over to the transmission screen.

"He’s one of us now, isn’t he?" Tenchi asked softly. Ryoko and Aeka hesitated a
little, and nodded. Almost to himself. "Who would have thought…?"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It’s all the ‘Yes, Tenchi’s awake!’, ‘Welcome back Tenchi!’,
‘Tenchi’s okay!’ and everything." Washu grumbled as she stood up and faced them,
hands on her hips. "What do I get for all my trouble, huh? Nothing but a pair of
sweaty palms and a headache."

"Thanks, Washu." Tenchi whispered, his head tilting slightly to look at her. "You’re
the greatest scientist there ever was, and one heck of a good friend."

"Well, heh heh, after all, I am a genius!" Washu smiled, her hand running through
her hair.

"Hooray for Washu, she’s the genius!" A doll announced.

"Hooray for Washu, she’s the greatest!" The other one.

"Washu," Aeka rather reluctantly left Tenchi’s side, then bowed low. "Thank you."

"Yeah," Ryoko appeared beside Aeka and did the same. "That must have been
tough on you."

"Well, not really." Washu smiled winsomely. "After all, …"

"She’s the one and only genius Washu, and it’s all just as simple as that!"

"She’s the one and only unfailable Washu, and it’s all just a piece of cake!"

"I’m the one and only greatest genius scientist ever in the entire universe, and if
you think I have any trouble with that operation, you can think again!" She laughed
heartily.

Tenchi faced the ceiling again, and shook his head.

    ===========================================================

"Kiyone!" Sasami’s face appeared on board Yagami. "Tenchi’s awake now!"

"That’s great, Sasami," Kiyone smiled at the little princess. "How’s he doing?"

"He’s very happy he’s back and I’m back, and he told me your friend’s name!"

"My friend?" Kiyone blinked.

"Yup, Tenchi said your friend Kova saved me!" She smiled, not noticing Kiyone’s
slight discomfiture. "He told me if I wanted to thank him I could tell you! Do tell him,
won’t you?" Kiyone nodded slightly, and she caught the look on her face, and
giggled. "Oh, Kiyone, is he who I think he is to you?"

"Well," Kiyone looked a little sheepish. "Not really."

"Hmmm?" Sasami arched an eyebrow, smiling sweetly. "You sure?"

"Not yet…" Kiyone smiled.

"Do remember to tell him, okay, Kiyone?"

"Erm… yeah, no problem." She smiled. "I’ll tell him the next time I see him."

"Kiyone!!" Mihoshi tugged her friend’s sleeve urgently. "Something’s happening!"

"Huh?" Sasami watched as Kiyone turned to look to the side, at outer space, and
saw the detective’s eyes open wide with fright. "Kiyone!?"

"Sasami!! Alert Ryo-oh-ki!" She shouted, not facing the viewscreen but using her
left hand to steer Yagami to the side. "Mihoshi! Set up advanced shield system!!"
Her fingers flew over the keyboard.

Sasami turned to look at the outside. "Ryoko! Aeka! Washu!"

All three turned from Tenchi to stare outside.

The ring about the Comet was shedding its outside, almost like it was turning itself
inside out rapidly, to reveal a ring of electric pulse cannons beneath, pointing out
in just about all directions.

"SHIT!" Ryoko managed. "Ryo-oh-ki, prepare evasive manuevers!"

Upset though the cabbit was with her master, even Ryo-oh-ki realised
insubordination was not an option given the current circumstances.

"I hope the chilli peppers hold out for her speed…"

    ===========================================================

"Alert, alert!" The Shuriken murmured. "Alert!"

"Huh?" Kova yawned and opened his eyes. "What’s the matter?" His body still
ached a little, especially his stomach, and though his shoulder was better his calf
was beginning hurt worse as the anaesthetic wore off.

"Enemy ship is preparing to open fire, electric pulse devices."

"WHAT!?"

"Elapsed time to fire, estimated at 1 second."

    ===========================================================

The boundless space around the Shuriken, the Comet, Ryo-oh-ki and the two SSS
shuttles was transformed into dazzling starbursts of blinding crimson light.

"Aaargh!!" Mihoshi, Kiyone, Ryoko, Aeka, Washu and Kova all exclaimed as their
ships trembled and the light streamed in through their screens onto their bridges
to consume their vision in dazzling brilliance. Their auto targeting systems, fuddled
by the bombardment of electrical charge matter, just filled up with red dots.

As Terminus’ ship sped towards the Comet under the cover chaos created by the
Archbeam, behind the Yagami, Solar’s major cannons seethed with emerald
energies, then blazed out full force.
