The Sorceress Syndrome
Episode Two:  The Power of the Star
Chapter 3:  Australia
Story:  Is Tenchi dying?  Keimosari and Washu are doing everything to 
help him.  
***********************************************************************

Okay, this could seriously be it for a while.  I'm also working in a 
Sailor Moon fic which needs my attention just as much.  And then 
there's school, but we all know how important that is.  If you're sick 
of hearing it, plug your ears now.  I do not own Tenchi Muyo!  There.  
Glad that's done with.

	Tenchi, Keimosari, and the others had been living in Ireland for 
about a month.  They had moved out of the hotel and rented apartments, 
courtesy of Nekaia.  Everything seemed fine.  That is, until something 
happened to Tenchi.
	The girls found him laying on the floor one night gasping for 
air.  Washu had taken him into her lab, hoping to figure out what was 
wrong with him.  Keimosari tried to use spells, but she couldn't cast 
anything strong enough to help him without the Star.  Finally, Washu 
figured out the problem.
	"There's a sort of bullet lodged in his heart.  It's slowly 
killing him, and if we don't help him, he'll die," she said sadly.  
	"No!  I won't give up on him.  Tenchi is my best friend, I can't 
lose him!  Washu, isn't there anything you can do?" Keimosari cried.
	"I might be able to temporarily sterilize the bullet, but there's 
no way to save him if you're not strong enough to cast a spell," Washu 
said.
	"So, why the heck haven't you helped him yet?" Ryoko yelled.
	"Because the sterilization process hasn't been tested yet.  It 
could hurt him more," Washu snapped.
	"Look you guys.  We're all really worried about Tenchi.  We've 
got to relax.  Now, I think we should test the sterilization process 
now, because personally, I would rather take the chance it'll help 
Tenchi than just waiting for him to die!" replied Nekaia calmly.
	"I must say, I agree with Niki-chan," Aeka added.  Everyone else 
agreed.
	"Okay.  Initiating sterilization," said Washu.  An hour later, 
Tenchi stood up as if nothing had happened.
	"I don't know what's going on, except that another attack like 
that's gonna kill you Tenchi," Washu said.
	"It was awful.  There was this terrible pain in my heart, and it 
got so bad I couldn't even sit up," Tenchi replied.  He shivered.  
There was something terribly wrong, and he wasn't sure he even wanted 
to find out what.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Okay!  We've got another stone sighting.  Any guesses as to 
where?" Washu asked one evening.
	"Russia?"
	"China?"
	"Italy?"
	"No, no, and no," Washu answered.
	"We give up," Tenchi laughed.
	"It's in the Southern Hemisphere," Washu hinted.
	"Madagascar?"
	"Paraguay?"
	"G'day mate!" Washu cried in an Australian accent.
	"Oh man!" said Tenchi.
	"You mean we have to go to Australia?" asked Keimosari.
	"You got it.  There's been news of a strange person who's been 
going on a mad killing spree in Sydney," explained Washu.
	"So?  What kind of stone would attack people?" Ryoko asked.
	"Hello!  The Physical stone?" Keimosari answered.
	"Niki-chan, I assume you'll pay for passage, room, and board?" 
asked Aeka.
	"Of course," replied Nekaia.
	Tenchi stared at her.  "Hey Niki-chan?  What's the deal with your 
family?" he asked.
	"Huh?  What do you mean?" she said, confused.
	"I mean, aren't your parents worried about you?  You left like, 
two months ago to go to Sapporo and they still haven't called or 
anything?" he tried to explain.  Nekaia turned away.
	"I don't know.  In fact, I can't remember anything before I met 
you on the plane.  I don't even remember where I came from before I got 
on the plane," she answered.
	"What?  How come?" questioned Aeka.
	"I don't know okay!  I don't know where my money came from, I 
don't know where I came from, I don't know who or where my family is!" 
she cried, breaking into tears.  Keimosari put her arm around her.
	"Hey, until maybe a year ago, I didn't know who my family was 
either.  I didn't know where I came from, and I didn't really know who 
I was.  But I didn't give up.  We all have a beginning, sometimes it's 
just harder to find it.  Don't give up Niki-chan.  I'll help you.  We 
all will," she explained.
	Nekaia smiled, "At least I know one thing."
	"What's that?" Tenchi asked.
	"MY NAME IS NEKAIA, NOT NIKI-CHAN!" Nekaia screamed.

	"And it seems that the mysterious murderer has struck again.  
Last night, the French Ambassador was found dead.  His ribs were 
crushed and had pierced his heart, causing intense internal bleeding," 
said the anchorwoman on TV.  Kiyone and Mihoshi were looking up at the 
TV while waiting for their baggage at the airport.
	"Whoa.  What kind of force could do that?" asked Mihoshi.
	"Sh!" said Kiyone.
	"This picture was seen through surveillance cameras at the 
ambassador's hotel," the anchorwoman continued.  A picture of a huge, 
muscular man came up.
	"If you know anything about this killer, who has struck three 
times here in Sydney, please call the number at the bottom of the 
screen."
	"Oh my gosh!" cried Kiyone.
	"What?"
	"I just figured out who that killer is!  To have strength like 
that he would have to be the monster created by the Physical stone!" 
Kiyone answered.
	"We'd better find Kei," Mihoshi answered.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"So you're saying, that instead of a monster, the Physical stone 
is taking the form of a serial killer?  How the heck am I supposed to 
combat that?" asked Keimosari.
	"I know!  If the Physical stone is a killer, you need killer-
catchers!" cried Mihoshi.  Tenchi and Keimosari looked at each other, 
confused.
	"Don't worry.  Your local Galaxy Police officers are here to 
help!  We'll find the killer's next target, capture him, then Keimosari 
does her little bit of magic.  He'll be a little charm for that 
bracelet before you can say 'Wow, he's a little charm on that 
bracelet'," said Kiyone.
	"Great idea!" exclaimed Tenchi.
	"We've even picked out his next target!" added Mihoshi.
	"He's mostly been attacking semi-royalty when they've been in a 
security lacking area.  Now, the British Prime Minister's son is 
turning twenty tomorrow, and he's planning to have a little celebration 
at the hottest nightclub in Sydney, The Pax.  We can go undercover, and 
catch him in his tracks!" explained Kiyone.
	"Yeah!  All right!  Party on!" called Ryoko.
	"Actually, I would highly recommend only Kiyone, Mihoshi, and 
Keimosari go.  I've been studying those monsters and it seems they can 
sense great amounts of power.  If it could sense Aeka or Ryoko, it 
would attack way before anyone was ready," said Washu.
	"I'm going," Tenchi replied.
	"What?  Tenchi, you almost died before!  If that happened again, 
I couldn't-" Tenchi put a finger to his sister's mouth.
	"Kei, I won't let you do this alone.  When we defeated Medea, we 
did it together.  We'll do this together too," he said.
	"Well both of you are going to need to new clothes if you're 
going clubbing.  You can't show up wearing stuff like that," laughed 
Nekaia.  "Come on."
***********************************************************************
***************
	"Come on Tenchi!  You too Kei!" said Sasami.  It was the next 
night, and they were planning to sneak into the party for the Prime 
Minister's son.  
	"Okay, don't laugh," Keimosari called from behind the door.  She 
stepped out.  
	"Hello!"
	"Nice"
	"That's so cute"
	"Thanks," Keimosari smiled.  She was wearing a blue, short-
sleeved satin blouse that showed off her slim figure.  A long black 
skirt with a light blue butterfly embroidered on it went down to her 
ankles, where high-heeled boots made her seem a few inches taller.  For 
once, she let her hair hang down her back, instead of in a ponytail as 
usual.
	"All right Tenchi, I've modeled, it's your turn," Keimosari 
called.
	Tenchi stepped out from behind the door.  He was wearing black 
jeans, a black leather jacket, and a white T-shirt.  He slipped on a 
pair of sunglasses, and put his arm around Keimosari's waist.  She 
looked up at him, puzzled.
	"What's that about?"  she asked.  Tenchi shrugged.
	"Wouldn't it seem more believable if we were a couple going out 
to party than if we were just brother and sister?" he explained.
	"Just remember Tenchi, she's not really your girlfriend!" yelled 
Ryoko.  The twins laughed.  Kiyone poked her head in the room.
	"Guys, we just called a cab.  Ready to go?" she asked.
	"Ready!" said Keimosari.  But deep inside, she knew what that she 
wasn't going out to party.  She was going out to catch a stone.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Once inside the club, the group split up.  Kiyone and Mihoshi 
went to check out the first floor of the club, while Tenchi and 
Keimosari investigated the second, which was really a balcony all the 
way around the dance floor.  After a few hours though, they were 
getting bored.
	"The monster still hasn't shown up yet!  Please Kiyone, can we go 
dance?" asked Mihoshi.
	"Go ahead you two.  Me and Tenchi will keep an eye on things from 
up here," Keimosari replied.  The police officers waved and took off 
for the dance floor.  
	But hours continued to pass.  No monster.  Finally Tenchi turned 
to his sister.
	"Kei, maybe Kiyone and Mihoshi got the wrong spot.  It's been 
hours and still no monster.  Why don't we go relax and have a little 
fun?" he asked.
	"Well, okay," Keimosari answered reluctantly.  They headed for 
the floor.
***********************************************************************
***************
	Midnight came and passed.  It was approaching 3:00 a.m. when the 
manager of the club finally said it was closing time for all public 
guests.  If you didn't have an invite to the party, you had to leave.  
Luckily, Keimosari had conjured up four invitations.  Unfortunately, 
they had the wrong names on them.
	"Hmm.  Now you're tellin' me that the four a you are supposed to 
be cousins of the Prince of England?" the security guard said 
suspiciously.
	"Of course!  Why would you doubt us?  You know, if you don't let 
us stay, we can speak to the manager about your awful behavior.  Not to 
mention British authorities," Keimosari said coolly.  The guard just 
grumbled and handed them back their invitations.  But when he was 
handing Mihoshi hers, he grabbed her wrist.
	"Um, hey sir?  Could you please let go?  You're kinda hurting 
me," she asked.  The man smiled and twisted her arm.  Mihoshi screamed.
	"I don't think you belong here.  Let me escort you out," he 
yelled.  Then he lifted Mihoshi over his head and threw her into the 
wall!
	"That's not a guard!  That's the-"
	"Physical stone!" finished Tenchi and Keimosari in unison.  The 
guard merely smiled again then reached for Kiyone.
	But before he could, a brown light came out of Keimosari's hand.  
The ground began to shake violently, and Kiyone fell.  A gust of wind 
caught her before she hit the ground, and safely floated her up to the 
second story.  Keimosari did the same for Mihoshi, but then the monster 
grabbed Tenchi by the neck.
	"Try any of your tricks, sorceress, and your sweetheart's head 
will be used for football games!" he laughed.  Keimosari gasped, then 
got an idea.
	The guard was wearing a hat.  Using a simple spell, she levitated 
it off of his head, then grabbed it.  The monster rolled his eyes and 
snatched it out of Keimosari's hand.  But in doing so, he touched her 
finger.  Letting out a cry of defeat, he dropped Tenchi and began to 
shrink.  Keimosari ran to her brother's side.  
	"Tenchi, are you okay?" she asked.  Tenchi looked up at her.  The 
bullet was draining his energy.  He was too weak to talk, but managed 
to move his hand over to Keimosari's bracelet.  A green stone appeared 
attached to the links.  Then, Tenchi closed his eyes.
	"NO!  Come on Tenchi!"  Keimosari held him in her arms, tears 
running down her face.  All of a sudden, the green stone began to glow.
	"Of course!"  Keimosari whispered to herself.  She murmured a 
spell that would temporarily heal Tenchi, but would unfortunately, send 
him into a short coma.  His breathing became regular.  
	Kiyone soon joined Keimosari, along with a slightly confused 
Mihoshi.
	"That bonk on the head made her a little weird, but I've seen 
stuff like this before.  She'll be better tomorrow," Kiyone reassured.  
The three of them carried Tenchi to a cab, then went home.
***********************************************************************
***************
	"So, when does he wake up?" Aeka asked.  They were home again, 
and Tenchi was well but still asleep from the spell Keimosari had cast 
the night before.
	"He should be fine in another day or two.  Until then, don't 
worry.  He's not in any pain or anything.  And it'll help him get over 
the party," Keimosari explained.
	"Say, how was the party?" asked Nekaia.
	"Well, until the monster came, it was a blast!" answered 
Keimosari.
	"So, the sorceress isn't boring and uptight," said Ryoko 
sarcastically.
	"BORING AND UPTIGHT?!?!?!" screamed Keimosari.  "THAT'S IT!"
	Keimosari jumped up and her hand began to glow, the indication of 
a spell.  Ryoko ran away laughing, with Keimosari close behind.
