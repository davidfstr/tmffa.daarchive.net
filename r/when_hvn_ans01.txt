	It had been a few moths since the gang had put away Yugi and life was 
getting back to its usual pace for everyone.well almost.  Aeka and Ryoko were up 
to their usual fights over Tenchi and Washu was working in the laboratory.on 
what no one dared ask for fear of being its test subject.  Sasami was back in 
the kitchen working on dinner; she still missed having Yugi around.  True, she 
could always visit the chamber where Yugi slept, and would continue sleeping for 
several years, but it just wasn't the same.  
She let out a sigh when these thoughts came to her, but she sill had Ryo-ohki, 
wherever she was right now. Tenchi was busily taking care of the shrine, and 
still sorting out his thoughts.  He missed Sakuya, true she 
had been a shadow of Yugi, and she did try, and succeed partially, in breaking 
up the gang, yet he still couldn't help but feel a loss deep inside.  "Tenchi!  
Boy, aren't you finished yet?!" Yosho shouted to him 
from his room.  "Sorry Grandpa, I'll be dome soon", Tenchi replied and began to 
work that much faster.  

	But there was something else troubling him.  After the battle with Yugi, 
everyone was back to their normal pace of life, everyone that is but Kiyone.  
She was a nice girl.er woman, but she was always so involved with her work.  Now 
especially, she seemed a bit distant from everyone, especially Tenchi.  She 
frequently missed meals and was usually absent when the gang went somewhere or 
did something.  Whenever Tenchi tried to ask her what was the matter, she simply 
said that she had a bit on her mind.  (I hope she's all right.) Tenchi began to 
wander again.  "Tenchi!!" Grandpa must have x-ray vision to see me not working!  
After Tenchi was done with his chores he got to thinking if he should go back to 
Tokyo for another break from things at home, more so though with Grandpa!

	"Kiyone what's with you?" Mihoshi asked while trying to hit her target.  
They had been practicing for over an hour and Kiyone had managed to miss all but 
one target.  Mihoshi on the other hand, had managed to hit all but on of her 
targets, that being the only one that Kiyone got.  "Nothing Mihoshi really!" 
Kiyone tried to protest, but if anything, Kiyone was a bad liar, and Mihoshi 
knew it.  Bang!  Another shot rang from her blaster but to her disbelief, she 
missed again.  "Look, I've had a lot on my mind after things went down with 
Yugi.well I've just been a bit, well preoccupied."  "Kiyone, we've been partners 
for a while and.well are you thinking about quitting?"  Mihoshi rather blurted 
out this before realizing maybe 
she shouldn't of said that.  "OF COURSE NOT YOU... TWIT!!!" Kiyone tried her 
best not to swear at Mihoshi, she knew how much the blonde office hated 
profanity.  "That's the LAST thing on my mind..." She took a deep breath and 
regained her composure  "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you Mihoshi, 
really"  "Kiyone, it's just that everyone is really worried about you...me, 
Washu, Ryoko, Sasami and especially Tenchi,oh Kiyone!", she started to cry.  
"Mihoshi, <sigh>, don't cry, I'll be fine, just give me a little time that's 
all, okay?"  She patted the blonde office on the back and they shared a silent 
moment together when Kiyone finally said "Mihoshi, why don't we go to town 
tonight for dinner, my treat okay?" "Really, oh goodie!!!" "I'll go get ready, 
you coming?"  "I'll be there in a little while, I need to get some 
more practice in"  "Okay, don't be too long!"  "Never fails..." Kiyone said to 
herself as she sized up for a few more rounds.  

	(So what REALLY is bothering me?)  Kiyone tried to focus on this dilemma 
since she wasn't getting any better with her target practice.  Everyone here was 
like family to her; they welcomed her and took to her as she took to everyone 
else.  She would sometimes help out Sasami with her chores and dinner before she 
would leave for work.  Occasionally, she would join Aeka in a bit of gardening 
as Aeka tried to help Kiyone be a little more gentle through a good hobby and 
that it would help relieve some stress, and 
working with Mihoshi sure built up quite a bit of that!  Ryoko, well every so 
often when she would come back late from work, while Mihoshi was out cold, she 
would join Ryoko for a drink or two or three.  While they were drunk, Kiyone 
would tell Ryoko how much of a promotion she would get if she brought Ryoko in.  
Ryoko always laughed it off and told her how much of a reward she would get if 
she brought Kiyone in to one of her old Space Pirate pals, the ones Kiyone 
helped to arrest.  Washu, well with Washu Kiyone would occasionally talk to her 
about possibly modifying the engine of her Police Cruiser to help her out and 
Washu would typically respond with her usual "I'll get to it when I have the 
time", which meant never! 

	Then there was...Tenchi.   She would always chuckle to herself when she 
saw both Aeka and Ryoko fight over him.  That was while she was trying to avoid 
any flying objects in the process!  But really, it was after that day when 
Tenchi got angry when they all wrecked the fair at his school, she never saw him 
get angry before.  She wished she hadn't been a part of the group that time.  
There was also that time when she tried to get Ryoko to admit why she really 
left Earth by asking if she could have Tenchi.or was it just for that reason.  
No she was just doing her job, yes that was it, just doing her job.  "Galaxy 
Police Detectives' do whatever it takes to get the job done!"  Bang!  She let 
out anther shot, and again it missed.  "AAAAARRRRGGGGGG!!!" she walked away from 
the range and headed back to the house. Kiyone 
decided she had had enough; maybe a nice meal would help...

*****************************************************************************

	"Oh, boredom, if only thou were so simple...BURP!!!"  The light in the 
room was dim, really dim to the point were one would wonder if it was worth even 
keeping the lights on.  This was not a concern of the resident of this room, nor 
was it his concern of the same Galacto-infomercial that was playing on the 
screen in his room.  "Clean this, knee-rider!"  With that, the screen was 
evaporated by a slight blast emitted from the dark corner where this individual 
was sitting.  The image of the creature on the screen was 
displaying a rather unique item that would in his words "Revolutionize the way 
everyone would keep their planet clean", but now the screen was little more than 
small atoms of little worth but in the fullness of time 
would merge to form hopefully something more useful.  

	"I think tonight I shall try to get drunk, though I have failed to do so 
every other time."  After saying this, the resident in particular decided to get 
up, slightly wash himself, meditate partially on his past and then on his future 
and then on whether he would pay this months rent or just level the building 
along with its pathetically dressed owner, and go out for a 
while.  Before doing so he glanced briefly at an old uniform, a bit tattered 
from some battles of old, and an old holocube of two individuals which lay on 
top of a stand which was devoted exclusively for this item in particular.  "..." 
With that, the portal closed behind him and he stepped out into the city lights 
headed towards the nearest stop for a stiff drink.  "Somehow, I have a feeling 
business may be picking up pretty soon, better be prepared."  With that, Sol-
Menhadrin, which was the identity he had chosen for the time being, decided he 
would need even more drinks to get ready for whatever may come his way.

*****************************************************************************

	It was late when Mihoshi and Kiyone had gotten back from dinner and later, 
against Kiyone's wishes, some karaoke.   "Mihoshi, get some sleep tomorrow, we 
have off remember?"  "Oh right, we get a day off now every month for outstanding 
service, wasn't that great of HQ to give us that?"  "I still would have 
preferred a transfer or a new partner myself." Kiyone tried to mumble under her 
breath.  "What was that Kiyone?" Mihoshi leaned her head out of the closet as 
she was getting her pajamas.  "Nothing, just get to bed."  Kiyone stared out the 
window in their room and looked to the heavens as if they could read her 
mind.and then she remembered a saying that Sasami had told her which she learned 
from an old Earth story, 

	"Starlight, Starbright, ."  "How silly, wishing..." Kiyone said to 
herself.  "Mihoshi, look I wanted to thank you for." but before she could finish 
her story, Mihoshi was out cold.  "Silly ditz, you don't even give yourself a 
chance to cover yourself in bed."  Kiyone draped the covers over Mihoshi and was 
near ready to go to bed when she thought about her ponderings of earlier today.  

	Tenchi, he certainly was an interesting person, a bit on the young side 
but, he certainly made up for it with his maturity and his caring of others.  
She had other relationships in the past but they were short 
lived, many of them being with Police Academy members or other acquaintances, 
but they all lacked something, or was she just being a bit too picky?  But now 
she had met this Earth boy, now Earthman, and well, maybe she was starting to, 
"Oh my!"  Kiyone found herself blushing.  "No, it can't be, besides, it wouldn't 
work.  We're just friends, and I First Class Police Detective Kiyone of the 
Galaxy Police Force am assigned to...protect..." she touched her lip and 
couldn't finish.  "I just don't know, <sigh>". 
Kiyone walked to the window, bent on one knee, looked up to the heavens, a clear 
night sky tonight was for her.  

	She closed her eyes and found herself repeating those lines again, but 
this time, she believed.  "Starlight, Starbright, first star I see tonight, wish 
I may, wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight...please hear my silent 
prayer, give me the wisdom and courage I need to know what to do, and if it is 
not me, then find me someone who can" After that, she got up, got changed and 
went to sleep.  She never noticed that a shooting star went across the sky and 
heard her plea for help.

	"It was only a few hours later when Kiyone was awakened by her communique.  
"This had better be important..." Kiyone, half awake, fished through her purse 
where she left her communique, found it and opened the channel.  "First Class 
Detective Kiyone here"  "Ah, Detective Kiyone, this is Lieutenant Mesik`, my 
apologies for waking you on your day off, but this of the utmost importance!"  
"Yes sir, what is it?"  "The Imperial Council of Alcaron has requested the 
assistance of the Galaxy Police in the capturing 
of one of the most wanted criminals in the Galaxy"  "You mean Ryoko, I never 
knew she had any dealings with Alcaron." The lieutenant shook his head and 
continued  "No, not her, there is another dangerous individual, perhaps even 
more so than Ryoko!".  "More dangerous that Ryoko?", Kiyone was eager to hear 
more about this case, this maybe what she would need to get her mind of her 
recent thoughts.  

	"Pay attention Detective!"  "Sorry sir, please continue!"  "The individual 
has been sighted on numerous accounts of grand theft, destruction, treason 
against the Military of Alcaron and murder."  "You are to do whatever is 
necessary to apprehend this individual at once, understood?"  "Yes sir!"  Kiyone 
snapped to attention, sleep was now just a past memory for her.  "I am 
forwarding you all pertinent information on this individual, be forewarned 
however, as he is considered armed and very dangerous.  It is preferred that he 
is to be taken alive, but if necessary, use lethal force."  "Understood sir, I 
just need to wake my partner Mihoshi and." "No detective, this case is too 
important to involve agent Mihoshi, The Imperial Council is fully aware of 
Detective Mihoshis' ethics and has requested that only you go on this mission, 
are we clear on this?"  "Sir, yes sir!"  "Good, the coordinates are being sent 
to you as well regarding his last location.  We believe 
he is staying at a complex in the Nestith Sector and is under the alias of Sol-
Menhadrin.  Time is of the essence Detective" 

	Kiyone needed to satisfy one bit of her curiosity though,  "Sir, what is 
the actual identity of this suspect, if I may ask?"  "<sigh>, I was asked not to 
discuss that information, but since the Imperial Council can be such pricks at 
times, his real name is..." Kiyone heard the name barely whispered across the 
communique.  Her eyes shot wide opened upon hearing of the identity of her true 
target.  "Sir, he is number one on the bounty hunters' list, why doesn't the 
Imperial Council let them handle this?"  "Because 
he is presently in GP territory and the Council does not wish to deal with the 
red tape to allow such a procedure.  You have your orders, I suggest you get 
moving Detective, HQ out."  With that, the communique was silent.  "Well, no 
time for second thoughts, sorry Mihoshi,not this time."  

	She tiptoed out the bedroom in her pajamas; she would have to get dressed 
aboard her ship.  Just as Kiyone was almost out the door,"Hey you, what are YOU 
doing up so early?"  "Oh Washu, heh-heh, good morning?"  "I'll say, big mission 
huh?  I thought this was your day off?" Washu slowly appeared from out the broom 
closet.  "Well, yes it is.  Look I don't have time to talk I have to get to the 
Nestith Sector immediately and it's a long way from here."  "Oh it is, which is 
why you'll just love what I have to 
tell you."  Washu smiled her usual mischievous grin and Kiyone felt a little 
sweat bead across her head.  

	"Remember all those times you asked me to modify the engine to your ship, 
well I FINALLY had the time to get to it!"  "Really Washu you are the greatest!"  
"Naturally, now before you go, tell me what's so importante` that you're up this 
early, and without Mihoshi?"  "Well, I have to apprehend one of the most 
dangerous individuals in the galaxy..."  "But Ryoko is up in her room."  "Not 
her, there is another, and possibly more dangerous individual than Ryoko."  
"WHO???"  "Washu, if I tell you, you cannot tell 
ANYONE about this agreed?"  "Darn, I have to keep a secret,okay.who's the 
hotshot?"  Kiyone whispered the name in Washus' ear and the mad scientists' eyes 
grew wide as dishpans.  "WHAT!!!!!!!!!! NOT HIM!!!"  "Will you keep it down!"  
Kiyone almost laid a hand across Washu hoping that no one else 
heard.  "Are you insane?" Washu inquired wild-eyed.  "You know him?" Kiyone 
demanded as well as anyone in pajamas could demand.  "Look Kiyone, I've seen a 
lot of things in my time, but this guy...GP must be seriously whacked to take 
this mission, the Imperial Council set them up to this didn't they?"  
"Yes, but how did you know?" Kiyone again demanded.  

	"All that I'm saying is BE careful, this is not your run of the mill pick 
pocket, he's bad news...now you better get going, if you still want to?"  "Of 
course I do, it's my job...well thanks for the engine upgrade...and tell Mihoshi 
I may not be back for a while okay?"  Kiyone snuck out the house and made her 
way to the lake where her ship was parked under water.  Tapping on her 
wristband, the ship responded and came to life.  After surfacing, the door way 
opened.   She quickly boarded and hopped into the flight seat 
and set the coordinates and engaged the Autopilot.  This would give her a chance 
to get changed and get briefed on this individual.  Washu watched from a 
distance for what she feared may be the last time she would see the police 
officer again.  "Watch your back Kiyone, you don't know what you're up 
against.."

	Kiyone, in full uniform, emerged on the bridge of the Yugami, the 
experimental GP ship that was assigned to Kiyone and Mihoshi as part of their 
promotion for outstanding service.  It was so much bigger than their old ship 
and had some other options that she still hadn't had a chance to check out.  
Kiyone had plugged in the coordinates given to her and had engaged the new drive 
that Washu had installed.  Not that the Yugami was a slow hunk, it was one of 
the fastest in the fleet, but with Washu's upgrade she would be 
in the Nestith Sector in no time.  "Now, let's see what I'm up against..." with 
that Kiyone accessed the files provided her by HQ.  The holographic projection 
screen clicked on and several options were available.  
Kiyone chose the main section, which basically cut to all the important 
information.  "Beginning briefing mission" the computer terminal began to speak 
in an almost humanoid like voice.  "NOW ACCESSING TOP SECRET INFORMATION: 
SUBJECT: VIN-ROC."   Kiyone stared wide-eyed at the screen, which displayed a 
holographic image of the most wanted individual in the universe.  Kiyone was 
determined to find out as much of this felon as possible.

*****************************************************************************
