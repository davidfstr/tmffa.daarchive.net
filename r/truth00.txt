The Truth: Author Notes

This is a story from the POV of each person
i.e.  The Truth: Ayeka is in Ayeka's POV for the most part. 
<thoughts> 
*********
most in between these thingies are in 3rd person POV
*********
Please let me know if  they are to much OOC, I really tried to 
keep them as close as possible.
I hope you enjoy the stories.  Also you don't have to read one to 
understand the rest. Enjoy!!

Also any one that can help me put into words my ideas would be greatly
 appreciated.
