Chapter #10: "The Royals ...are here!"

The Masaki Residence - Saturday Afternoon


In space around Saturn, three Jurai Tree ships, two half as large as the
third, arrive with a whoosh (If that could have been
heard in an airless space). The King Of Jurai was contemplating his plans
for the afternoon, and how he was going to get his
daughters back from that insolent pup of a great grandson, and how he will
force Yousho to return as well. "I will have my
revenge Tenchi, and I will get my children back whether you like it or
not!" was all Asuza thought about as the ships neared
earth.

As the Family started to gather for the day's lunch a slowly building roar
came from above. Yousho and Tenchi making their
way down the shrine steps see saw first a Jurian tree Ship. Then another
appears to the right of the first nearly the identical
length but shaped differently. Finally, a massive Tree ship, which dwarfs
the first two, appears between them. "Well it seems
my parents have arrived," said a stoic Yousho still in his youthful and
true form.

Tenchi, after being startled back from reality, by the nudging of Yousho.
"Do, you think our plan will work, Grandpa?" said
Tenchi hesitantly.

"The plan plays on my fathers weaknesses, and on my mother's and aunt's
strengths. I think it will succeed." replied Yousho.

"Well, whatever he can throw at us, I think he'll be surprised." stated
Tenchi.

"Don't underestimate your great-grandfather Tenchi. He is the Emperor for
very good reasons."

Tenchi nodded in acknowledgment of Yousho's point. "Grandpa, he also cannot
underestimate ... us!" he said in a now serious
tone.

"Good, Let's go meet them and hopefully have an interesting, and
informative lunch" said Yousho. They both nodded and
headed for the dock.

All the girls were at the onsen relaxing and relishing in their newfound
status as mother's to be. Sasami had been with them up
to a half-hour ago, when she left to make the day's lunch. The roar of the
Jurian Tree ships shook the onsen and it's occupants.
"Damn! can't they control their engines any better than that?" said a now
upset Ryoko.

"They may have done that .... on purpose. My father likes to have an
expansive entrance." Said Ayeka in an annoyed tone.

"Yeah, it seems Dad-in-law needs to make sure we know he's here!" says an
equally grumpy Washu.

"Oh, does that mean he's my great, great, great, grand father in law?" asks
Mihoshi.

"Well, Yeah. But I don't want to get into who's related to who, and how. It
give me a headache just thinking about it!" replies
Washu.

"Well Ladies, we'd better get back and dressed so we can greet the In laws,
Grandparents, parents ... oh well you know what I
mean!" Begrudged Ryoko as she made her way through the portal Washu had
opened, which led to the bedroom areas of the
house. The rest of the girls then having finished their bathing, followed
along.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The Greetings

Within 5 minutes the whole Masaki clan gathered in the patio area just in
front of the pier jutting out into the lake. (Including
Nobuyuki who took off work to be with Mihoshi as stated in Chp.9.) As the
girls gathered consciously with their loves, The
Royal family Beamed down from their respective ships Funaho to the left,
Misaki to the right, then the Emperor himself,
Asuza at the center. Also noticed were two more figures who seemed to beam
from the Large center tree ship that was
Asuza's. One figure was a man, seemingly in his thirties if his looks match
the age that he would look like here on earth. The
second figure was smaller, a boy about 12 or 13 years old. Both looked
stoic and didn't look directly at the Masaki's.

As the Royal family moved forward towards the Masaki's, a shout was heard
from the older stranger that had beamed down
moments ago. "I Lord Ito, head of the Makoto Jurai Noble family Challenge
the Validity of Tenchi Masaki's heritage as being
the Great grand son of Our beloved Emperor Asuza!"

As Lord Ito finished, he was mad aware of stone cold glares he was being
given by the Two Jurai Queens. "Lord Ito, the time,
... and place for such declarations are for... after the Royal Family
greets its members after a long time apart. Am I making
myself Clear!! Said a fuming Misaki.

"Yes, Let us have our time with our family, Lord Ito, or are you not
respectful of your Queen's wishes." replied Funaho. As
Lord Ito looked to the Emperor for any indication from him as to what he
should do. He gave him not acknowledgment,
leaving the now the Jurai Lord to fend for himself.

After a moments repose He said; " I am most humbly sorry for making such a
challenge at such an inopportune time. Please
forgive my impertinence." He bowed deeply while the young boy next to him
looked perplexed at his companion's actions.

"You are forgiven, ... for now." Replied Funaho not letting the glare leave
her face at the now cringing Jurian Noble. She then
focused her attention at greeting her nieces, Grand children and Great
grand son. Misaki was hugging everyone within a breath
of their life. Even Yousho couldn't get away from her vice like grip.

As all had gathered into the now expanded Dining room thanks to Washu's
machinations, the couples sat together. On one side
(Nobuyuki, Mihoshi, Yousho, and Washu), while opposite to them was Ayeka,
Tenchi, and Ryoko. The third side of the dining
room table, facing the kitchen was where Sasami and Ryo-oki in her child
form sat. Finally The last side was reserved for
Funaho, Asuza, and Misaki. Lord Ito, and his young brother Yota beamed back
to Asuza's ship after Ito's flubbed challenge.
"Well, How have all of you been since last we visited?" asked a smiling
Misaki. Everyone looked around each other as if to see
whom would spill the beans about this past week's happenings. Finally,
Ayeka cleared her throat and began retelling the events
of last Saturday. When it came to mentioning Washu's invention, Washu waved
her to stop and she rose to continue (Yousho
continued to hold her hand). As the facts that came to be that morning were
revealed Asuza stood up with a very red and angry
face.

"THEY ARE WHAT?!??"

Well... were all Pregnant... Dad!" Washu added as she finished and sat back
down. Asuza looked like he literally was about to
blow his top.

Funaho, and Misaki, who were also dazed by the news given, quickly got
their bearings and each took ahold of Asuza's arms.
Then he got a confused look, then asked "That means I'm a grandfather, a
great grandfather, and a great great grandfather as
well?" Was all he asked out loud.

After a few seconds of quick conversation between the family members,
Sasami answered "Yup, Your all of those, Daddy!"
Asuza looked down at his youngest (And not pregnant) daughter and smiled.
Then he stood back up rigidly, and for the first
time in his 10,000  year reign as Emperor, he fell back like a ton of
bricks and fainted!

As the Queens tried to revive the fallen Monarch, Tenchi and Washu were
having a quick conversation.

""Listen Tenchi, make sure you are holding their hands when it happens.""
said Washu.

""Are you sure, I won't hurt them if they're holding my hands?"" asked
Tenchi nervously.

""Yes! Heck, you might give them more power by doing that. And let me tell
you, that would be real impressive.""

""Ok, I'll use our link so they'll know this.""

"Good, now lets help everybody back and have a nice lunch."" finished Washu
as they and the others made their way back to
the dining room table. As the lunch got back on track, Tenchi passed on the
information he had discussed with Washu, both
girls mentally acknowledged him. Then he asked them to meet him after the
Challenge that was to come. He now knew what he
had to do! As Lunch was finishing up, Asuza then reminded everyone of the
challenge given by Lord Ito. As his wives glared
at him, Asuza then explained that Ito was the uncle of the sap Seriyo, the
pink hared buffoon and lout that was almost drowned
by Mihoshi as he tried to fight Tenchi for Ayeka's hand during their last
visit.

It seems that Ito's and Seriyo's family felt slighted and betrayed by
Seriyo's loss. So they demanded a rematch, this time with
their most experience family member to replace the buffoon. Tenchi inquired
why did Ito bring his little brother to his battles.
Asuza didn't have a direct answer simply because he didn't know why, other
than speculating that he wanted to show his
younger brother how to conduct one self in a dual. This did not sit well
with Tenchi. He mentally asked Ryoko to get Washu to
investigate the Makoto Jurai Noble family and more specifically Ito and his
brother Yota. Washu after hearing this  agreed and
promised to have something on them soon.

Tenchi then got up and slowly made his way to the patio's sliding glass
door, followed by both Ayeka, and Ryoko. The rest of
the family including the Royals followed the Trio at a distance. As Asuza
sat down dejectedly between his two still angry
wives, they all stayed in the patio area awaiting the return of the Lord
and his brother.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The Challenge

Lord Ito is pacing in his spacious cabin on board of Asuza's massive Jurai
tree ship. In all of the information that he has
gathered from his bubbling nephew Seriyo, as well a other sources in the
Jurai government, He is sure that he can win against
this pretender to the throne. He knew that Mihoshi's watery landing
actually won the day for Tenchi. And even if the boy had
been trained to use Tenchi-ken, he simply couldn't believe he had enough
training to beat himself. A noble who had trained for
hundreds of years. Confidence exuded from the pompous Nobleman.

"Brother?" asked a meek a sullen Yota.

"Yes, Weakling! What do you want?" answered Lord Ito sarcastically.

"Isn't this the one who beat the Space Pirate Kagato?" asked the quiet
Yota.

"No, this couldn't be the same Tenchi ... could it?!?" Now Ito was
confused. Could this ...boy be the same warrior the rumors at
court said had beaten Kagato, and even destroyed his great ship, Souja by
cutting it in half with his Jurai power?

"No, that's just it, a rumor. Nothing more!" He then grabbed his brother by
his collar, giving him a mean scowl. "Keep quiet
Yota, Just remember to keep within eyesight of me as I fight this fool for
Ayeka's hand, and think of nothing more, understand
little brother!" Yota meekly nodded affirmatively. Then Ito shook Yota
violently. "Don't fail me boy, or you'll go back to that
Orphanage Father found you in. Remember the deep dark dank room you lived
in. do you want to go back to that? If you fail
me, you'll go back. Remember, ... since father's accident... I am in charge
of this Family, I can keep you, ... or not." Ito then
let go of Yota, who landed in a heap on the floor. He sneered at Yota on
the floor. As a knock came upon their door. An
officer sent to fetch the two for their appointed meeting to come with the
terran, Tenchi Masaki. Ito was thinking of what
could be when he won. He soon finds out never to get ahead of one's self
when it comes to one Tenchi Masaki.

As the whole family gathered on the patio, Most took a seat on the patio
itself with Sasami and Ryo-oki in her child form
giving everyone some juice and pastries like they were on a picnic. But the
intentions were anything but a calm and quiet
family gathering.

Lord Ito stood impatiently on the tree ship's bridge waiting for Tenchi to
make his way outside. Yota was several feet behind
him standing near the great tree's trunk. As Tenchi, with Ryoko, and Ayeka
made his way outside. Lord Ito demanded that he
and his brother be beamed down right away. Without any time wasted by the
ship's Captain, who had had enough of the
pompous Lord, they disappeared instantly and appeared next to the dock
about 15 meters from Tenchi, and the girls.

"Well, it seems you have more than barbarians on this backwater planet
after all." said Ito trying to anger the Young Prince.

Tenchi sighed, and answered; "Lord Ito, I have no quarrel with you. I never
wanted to fight your nephew, nor do I want to
fight you, I just want to live my life here on earth, with my friends, and
family. Please if you want you can stay and we can...."

"I do not consort with an offspring of a deserter to the crown!" This
stopped the conversation on the patio cold. The Emperor
slowly stood up with a great scowl on his face. No one insults any member
of the royal family even those who choose not to
adhere to their responsibilities. Ito for his part wasn't paying attention
to the people on the patio, though he should have. Ito
was focusing on angering Tenchi and thereby making him start the fight with
an unfocused charge. But, Ito didn't anticipate
the training Tenchi had been given by Yousho Former First Prince of Jurai.
Ito knew of Yousho's reputation, but No one knew
but those of the Royal Family that Yousho was in fact Katsuhito. Lord Ito
had assumed that Yousho has perished long ago,
because he had gotten hold of a sanitized report given to the Jurai Council
stating that now erroneous information.

Then Lord Ito triggered his Master key, and started to walk towards Tenchi
who had Tenchi-ken in hand, but not triggered.
""Girls, If I need you I'll call for you, but for now, just keep out of the
way, OK!"" Tenchi mentally said to his brides to be.
Both girls looked concerned, but did what Tenchi asked and stood about 15
meters behind Tenchi as he reluctantly triggered
Tenchi-ken.

As the dual commenced there was various parries and thrust as each
combatant tried to gauge the skill level of their opponent,
as well as how much Jurai energy each could weld. As they dueled Ryoko, and
Ayeka mentally were noting from their
viewpoint their assessment of Ito's fighting skills. They also noticed
something strange. Ito's brother, Yota was standing
perfectly still, ... and had his eyes closed. He seemed to be concentrating
on something, but they could tell what. They fed this
information to Tenchi as he fought, and to Washu who had snuck back inside
her lab and was using her instruments to gather
data on the dual, and on The two Makoto' s backgrounds.

As the sparring was getting more intense, and acrobatic, with both
opponents flying and parrying 20 meters above the ground,
Washu got the results of the background check and she whistled with
surprise. "No wonder this guy's so strong." was all
Washu said as a contingency plan came into the geniuses mind. She smiled
and then conveyed her idea to her daughter, who
with a smirk sent it on to Ayeka, ... and Tenchi.

Tenchi smiled. Which caught Ito's eye. By this point each had been fighting
for a good 8 minutes without either letting up or
slowing down. Then Lord Ito then smiled a devilish smile as he stopped and
concentrated for a moment. Then four green Light
Hawk Wings appeared in front of him. He then merged with one and
reconfigured his clothes to a Red on white lighted Robes.
He then grabbed one wing and formed a sword, while the other two wings
osculated to form a shield between him and Tenchi.
A slight surprised look formed on Tenchi's face, followed quickly by a calm
and collected one. He then concentrated and his
three wings formed in front of him. Lord Ito was ... Shocked! He wasn't
informed that Yousho's grandson had this ability. As
Tenchi set up his 3 Blue wings in a similar configuration as Lord Ito. The
surprised Lord charged and Light Hawk Wing came
in contact with Light Hawk Wing, with explosive results. Tenchi had to go
on the defensive, as he didn't want the egotistical
Lord to somehow hit the earth and cleave it. He knew the great power a wing
had, so he did not go on the offensive because of
this. So, because of Tenchi's defensive stance, Lord Ito pressed the attack
on the Prince.

Throughout this The Royal Family and the rest of the Masaki clan was
watching the dual in wonder. Even the Emperor was
perplexed, not just at the Light Hawk Wings being exhibited By Tenchi. He
already knew about that through Mihoshi's
exhaustive reports. But how did a lower ranking power hungry Lord Ito get
this type of power as well. As he pondered this,
Tenchi was fighting a steadily losing battle. Ito was increasing his power
on the Light Hawk Wings exponentially. By now
Tenchi knew where Ito had been getting the additional power and he mentally
called his wives to be to be ready. Then as he
flew back towards the ground, with Ito chasing after, he sent a mental
signal, and Tenchi landed between Ryoko, and Ayeka.
While still in Light Hawk Wing mode he took their hands, they in turn
transformed as each now had two Light Hawk Wings
each, and each used one wing to transform their attire, Ayeka, with the
same battle suit, a bright white Kimono with pink
highlights she changed into. (Ed note: similar to the one worn By Achika in
the Tenchi Movie. "Tenchi Muyo in Love".)
Ryoko was a combination of a similar style as Ayeka's but with red on black
highlights.

Lord Ito was stupefied. Not at just the exhibited Seven Total Wings, but
that they had come together ... against him. "How can
they ...have Wings?" Asked Lord Ito.

"They generated their own wings Lord Ito, ... unlike you!" said a now angry
Tenchi.

"What do you mean, you insolent Pup!" replied an indignant Ito.

Tenchi then walked toward Ito and said; "Why do you use someone else's
Jurai power to generate those wings?"

Emperor Asuza was astounded, but sensing the power emanating first from
Tenchi, then from Ryoko, and Ayeka. He saw that
each had indeed generated the Wings on their own. That cannot be said for
the now infuriated Lord Ito. As Asuza felt the
atmosphere he sensed that Ito was ...a conduit for another's power. As he
slowly surveyed the surroundings, he came upon the
almost invisibly quiet Yota. He stayed near the dock eyes closed and
concentrating so much that he was sweating profusely.

As Asuza realized what Tenchi said was true, Ayeka, and Ryoko moved behind
Tenchi, joined hands and teleported away. As
all gathered started looking for the two girls, Ito lunged at Tenchi,
trying to use the distraction to hurt the Jurian Prince. But
as he was halfway there, his power suddenly left him. Lord Ito slammed onto
the ground with a loud thud.

As the now dirty Lord looked up from his lowly position. What he saw
dismayed him greatly. Standing next to his now
collapsed brother were Ayeka, and Ryoko, with Ryoko holding one of Washu's
Hypo sprays. Each girl was smiling a
"cat-got-the-canary-like" smile. As Ito then felt something very hot next
to his neck. He then slowly turned as he saw a Light
Hawk sword inches from his neck.

"Yield now, and I'll make sure you'll live. But let me make this clear lord
Ito, your control of your "adopted" brother is over.
You will also step down as leader of your families noble house, and will
never hold any government position again." Tenchi
then waited for his answer.

"And if I refuse this ...offer of yours!" said a still defiant Ito.

"Then you will die by my sword, and all your families assets will revert to
Jurai Royal Family, and you estates will be sold,
your wealth redistributed to...."

Ito cut Tenchi off. "All right, All right, I concede." was all Ito could
whimper out as his head fell down to the ground sobbing.

Asuza was ...impressed at the skills Tenchi had shown then. Not just the
skills of the sword, but the battle strategy, as well as
his negotiations with the now disgraced Lord Ito. The Emperor didn't really
care for the uppity Lord; he simply wanted to see
how Tenchi would react to another powerful being, and how he would handle
himself. It was now obvious Tenchi, given an
impetus can think on his feet, and had surrounded himself with capable
advisors, (Washu, Yousho), as well as competent help
(Ryoko, Ayeka, and Mihoshi). The old crusty Emperor had made up his mind;
Tenchi was worthy of Ayeka's love and his
consent.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Mending Fences

After Ito was taken back to Asuza's ship, Those on the patio who had
witnessed the dual had gathered around a now tired but
happy Tenchi. Sasami, who seemed to have taken a liking to Yota, had taken
him with Yousho's and Washu's help inside the
house for him to recover and to inform him that he wouldn't be under Ito's
thumb anymore. In fact Washu wanted to study
Ito's unique use of his Jurai power, plus Sasami seemed to want to have him
stay a while.

As everyone was talking about the day's events, Tenchi approached his great
grandfather. "Your Highness, can I have a word
with you, Sir?" asked a tentative Tenchi. They made their way to the end of
the dock where they stared off out over the lovely
sight of the valley lake flanked by the forested hills that surrounded it.

"What do you want to ask me, ... great grandson?" Tenchi was surprised. Not
only did he acknowledge that fact of his heritage
and connection to him; he was speaking in a calm and collected voice.
Tenchi hoped that would stay that way, but what he
wanted to ask would and should cause a reaction.

Tenchi hoped it would be positive, So he crossed his fingers and then
asked; "I am in Love with Ryoko," He looked at his great
grandfather, who didn't react, then went on:" ...and with Ayeka! I want to
marry them both. So, I am asking for your
permission to marry Ayeka."

Tenchi then waited for Asuza's reply "Has Professor Washu given her
approval ... for you to Marry Ryoko?" Was Asuza's
confusing question. Tenchi answered that yes he had asked before the duel,
and she agreed to it. "Then, ...If my wives don't
object, ... I have no objections. But..." and Tenchi held his breath as
Asuza paused, then continued. "As I have seen today, if
Yousho doesn't serve within the next 2000 years to become Emperor, will
you?"

Tenchi digested what Asuza had said, "Within the next 2000 years". Tenchi
then asked; "So, Ayeka, Ryoko, and I can stay on
Earth for that long, until I have to serve as Emperor?"

"Yes, is there a problem, Tenchi?" Asked a now concerned Asuza. After all
he had completely changed his mind about the
Grandson of Yousho. He hoped that he was not going to do or say something
that would make him mad at him again!

"No, Nothing great grandpa, I just wanted to make sure of what you said.
I'll have to ask both Ayeka... and Ryoko about
serving, then I can have a final answer. Will that be ok?" Asuza looked At
Tenchi, then at his perspective wives to be, and then
he let out a loud and hearty laugh. He knew exactly what Tenchi meant by
his statement. How he knew about doing things
without his wives approval, even today, he was still getting in hot water
over his shortsightedness. Both his wives had already
approved of Tenchi, and he knew that he'd hear it from here back to Jurai
and beyond if he didn't concede this to them. He
smiled then knowing Tenchi would have the same problem as well. Both his
wives now were at his side, and saw the smile they
rarely saw when it came to Tenchi, and their family here on earth. After he
had informed them of what Tenchi had asked, and
his answer, he was attacked by both of them (Yes even Funaho). Being kissed
like that hadn't happened in many years. He then
looked at Tenchi and simply mouthed "Thank You!" Tenchi nodded in
understanding as he was kissed after he had explained
the time they had on earth until they had to take the reigns of Jurai.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

A Private Wedding

As the day wore on the official Proposals were made. First as the girls had
conferred on earlier were Yousho and Washu, who
in front of the assembled family which included Asuza, Funaho, and Misaki.
As everyone was watching, Yousho now
permanently in his young form, approached, and bent down to one knee in
front of a now nervous adult Washu. "I have seen
much in my life, but you have seen more, I have my beliefs, and ways of
doing things as have you. But being alone does not
mean not caring from someone, and ever since I have met you, I have found
my equal in mind, body and soul. Washu Habuki,
The Greatest Scientific genius in the Universe, and a good and kindhearted
women that I know so well. Will you marry this
humble Shinto priest Who will not only be your partners in life, but the
father of our children, and Hopefully your best friend.
Because you are all that to me, ...and more." He took a breath "Will you
marry Me?"

"Well, I suppose I could take sometime from my experiments for say Our life
times!" Everyone gave her a puzzled look.
"What I mean is ... Yes, My lovely Yousho, I will marry you!" They embraced
and kissed passionately. All the girls Ahhhed,
and all the men smiled.

Then rather nervous Tenchi took Ryoko, and Ayeka, by the hand and then took
the two jewelry cases, and then began to speak;
"Two years ago, I was a normal teenage boy who was a shy as many at this
age. So not to many girls took notice of me. I seem
to have been the nice guy who never got the attention that the other guys
did. So I always was one of those guys who never
danced with any girl, or always went to the movies alone cause no one
wanted to go with me. Then I stole that Key from
Grandpa, and the rest is history." Most of the spectators laughed but
quieted down when Ayeka, and Ryoko glared at them.

Tenchi then continued he squeezed their hands to get their attention back.
They looked back at him, then calmed down. I have
never like the fights you two had over me. So last Friday when I graduated
I knew this would be the last summer that I would
have to choose one of you. Then fate stepped in, in the form of Washu's
invention, and we ended up together." (He and the
girls blushed profusely) He then continued: " I know... now that I didn't
have to choose, and you two don't have to fight over me
anymore. Because you both have my heart equally and totally. Ayeka, First
Princess of Jurai,and Ryoko Habuki, Former Space
Pirate, Will you two fulfill my love for you, and be with me for the rest
of my life as my loves, and my wives and partners in
life... Will you marry me?"

Then both happily knelt down and glomped him with tears and both yelling
"YES, YES, YES, YES!!!"

In the background stood Yota Makoto observing what was going on. He felt
...happy at the families' joy, but a bit melancholy
at the thought of his future. Why did the Royal Family and Prince Tenchi in
particular spare him the punishments given to his
foolish older brother? But he still was happy not playing the power games
he made him do. Then a hand was on his shoulder.
It was Yousho, looking down on him knowingly. Then Washu was on his other
side smiling at him. Yota smiled back. Maybe
his future was with this family, here on this backwater planet. They seem
to genuinely love each other and he was happy here
now. Then he spotted two beautiful pink eyes looking right through him.
They belonged to the smiling face of Sasami Jurai. He
smiled back and kept that smile and her in his 12 year old eyes, as the
festivities continued.

Finally, and unknown to the rest of the family, except for Yousho. Nobuyuki
and Mihoshi had gotten a marriage License in
town earlier in the week. So after a boisterous dinner, everyone was
invited to the shrine where Nobuyuki Masaki, exchanges
marriage vows with Mihoshi Koramatsu. To honor His first wife, and with the
insistence of Mihoshi, They emerge from the
Shrine, Mr. and Mrs. Masaki!

After a small reception, which consisted of the family there including the
Royals, Washu asks Mihoshi to her Lab. There she
redid the previous tests that did confirm their shared heritage. Then Washu
dials up on her Galactic communicator, GP
headquarters. She mentally calls for Ryoko to join her and Mihoshi in her
lab, she complies. Within the next 15 minutes a
Habuki Family reunion occurs. Grand Marshal Koramatsu, Mihoshi's
grandfather learns of his sister Ryoko who then talk a
while and his long lost mother whom he agrees to find some leave time to
come and visit all three. Washu is finally having her
dreams come true. Her family is now whole, and she's marrying the man who
she sees spending the rest of her life with, and
she having another baby. What more could there be for her and her family?
Like a certain Sci-fi movie line once said,

"There are always ... possibilities!"

And that is another story to be told!



** A special Message from the Author:

Hi, I hope you have enjoyed reading this story as I have in writing it. Now
I  have a question of my readers! I have various
ideas on where this story will head from here. I am thinking of three ways
to go; first, to end it here and be done with it. (I
don't really want to do that!) Second, to continue this story as a separate
story, probably covering their weddings, pregnancies
and births

Third, to simply continue without stopping, sort of like a continuing
story. I'd like your input either on the review boards, or
e-mailing me directly (dennisud). Thanks, and I will start on this next
step at the end of this month, hope the wait isn't too
long! dennisud
