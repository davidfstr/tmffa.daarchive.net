Disclaimer:  Pioneer owns these characters, and I don't.  There.  I said
it.  Are you happy?

Author's notes:  It's time to rock.  In the prolog, I showed you what
the characters of the Mirror universe are like.  This time, you'll see
how they interact, and then chapter two will see them start to cross.
Enjoy!

Tenchi Muyo!:  Mirror Image

Chapter one

==========

        "Tenchi?" calls Ayeka.  "Where are you?"

        The man in question is in his usual place, his room.  This is the only
room that Washu put a field around.  If anyone enters without his
approval, they are promptly sent into the lake.

        "Tenchi?  You know what happens when you try to hide from me.  I
promise not to hurt you too badly this time."

        Tenchi, hiding in his room, tries to ignore the voice of death.
"Please go away." he says to himself.

        Misa, overhearing Ayeka's calls, "do you need some help, Ayeka?"

        Tenchi looks towards the voice in horror.  <Misa hasn't gotten through
the field, yet, but she's getting close.>

        "Yes, Misa, I do.  It seems Tenchi has run off again.  I can't find him
anywhere."

        "He's probably in his room again."

        "Are you going to attempt to phase again?"

        Cracking her fingers, "sure.  Why not?"

        With the gem on her right wrist glowing,  Misa starts to become
transparent.  Putting her hand against the wall, she can feel the usual
pain from the field.  However, she is trying to push aside the pain.
Pushing her arm in, it starts to go through.

        Tenchi looks over and sees a hand phase through the wall.  <Oh, no!>

        Suddenly, Ryoko appears behind the Juraian warrior and pulls her out of
the wall.  "Don't make me hurt you."

        "Ryoko!" Misa says.

        "Leave Tenchi alone!" Ryoko shouts.

        "We're just out to have a little fun," Ayeka states.

        "Yeah, well, last time you had fun with him, he couldn't move for three
days."  Looking back, he sees that Misa is trying to sneak away.
Sending a beam sword into the floor near her, "stay put.  You're next."

        "Look, if we're ever going to build up Tenchi's endurance, he needs
this."

        "Poor excuse.  You just want someone to torture."

        "That too."

        "Look.  Tenchi was just fine until you showed up."

        "Are you implying I had something to do with it?"

        "Yes!  Look, just leave him alone.  Torture someone else."

        Ayeka turns, "party pooper!" and walks away.

        Tenchi, hearing two people leave, opens the door.  "Ryoko?"

        "They're gone."

        "Thank you." he says.

        Ayeka and Misa meet at the kitchen table.  "Well, are you adapting to
the field?" Ayeka asks.

        "Almost.  It didn't hurt as much this time.  Out of curiosity, are you
ever going to leave him alone?"

        "Should I?"

        "No.  Is there anything new you wanted to try on him?"

        "I heard unwanted sex can be fun."

        "Is that why you wanted him this time?"

        "Yes."

==========

        Ryoko brings Tenchi to Washu for important news.  "Washu said she
needed to tell us something.  But, she's not here."

        "Yes, I am," Washu states.  "Indeed I have news.  Tenchi, how would you
like the other three girls gone?"

        Suddenly attentive, "I would.  But, how?"

        "I finally finished a new invention.  After I saw Misa start to phase
through the field, I knew it was time for this."

        "So, what does this invention do?" Ryoko asks.

        "Simple.  I'll send them to another dimension."

        "So, do it," Tenchi commands.

        "They have to be in the lab first."

        "That shouldn't be hard," Tenchi states.

==========

        Tenchi wanders out of the lab, knowing that Misa and Ayeka will be
looking for him.  Like clockwork, they move in on him.

        "Tenchi!" Misa says.  "Ayeka has something to show you."

        "Yes, Tenchi, I want to demonstrate something," she says, opening her
shirt.  "It won't hurt if you don't want it to."

        Misa pulls off her shirt, "and I can help in the demonstration, if you
want me to."

        Tenchi turns back to the lab and sees Sasami standing in his way.  "You
should go along with them.  It won't hurt."

        Tenchi, pushing her aside, runs back into the lab.  "Those girls are
nuts."

        "Tenchi!" Ayeka screams.  "You can't hide forever!"

        Misa and Sasami join her as the trio enters the lab.

        "Now!" Tenchi yells.

        At the command, Washu activates her invention. A second later, the
Juraians start to fade.  "Tenchi!" Sasami yells angrily.

        Irritated, Ayeka uses her power to pull Tenchi towards her.  "If I go
anywhere, you're coming with!"

        Misa, catching on, ensnares the other two with her power.  "Wherever we
go, we all go!"

        "Wait!" Washu yells, as the entire group vanishes.
