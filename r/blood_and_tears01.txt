                              Blood and tears part 1

    Ryoko and Tenchi have confessed their love for one another and are
getting married. But three shadows from the past will make this the shortest
wedding yet. Now in this scene we see the three enemies ready to get to
earth. Can you make an educated guess who they are?

    "Can't this hunk of junk go any faster?" One of the three figures in the
cockpit groaned angrily.

    "Have some patience my friend." Chuckled a low sinister voice "I had to
be patient for a hundred years to escape from sub-space.

    "Will both of you shut up?" The figure in the cockpit yelled. "You two
do
this every light-year!"

    "Look at it this way," The figure who had spoken first said. "We get to
avenge ourselves plus get the house of Jurai, and that little fool Tenchi."

    "We all owe him." Growled the sinister cruelest voice again. "He has
defeated all of us and cost us veangance, thrones and paybacks. Not to
mention he defeats us and then goes on with his pathetic little life!" The
figure in a rage slammed his fist into the wall of the ship.
    "CIAO!!"
    "WATCH IT, YOU IDIOT!" Screamed the pilot. "You can't punch this ship
like you can yours if you even need one."

    "I am sick of your insults, bitch. I could kill you in a second."

    "Try it and you die, shadow-boy. I'm not as lenient as the Galaxy
Police."

    "The second figure's voice called out: "Look you two need to stop
fighting among yourselves. Save it for Earth."

    "The pilot's mouth twisted in a smile. "Speaking of Earth it looks like
we're here."
