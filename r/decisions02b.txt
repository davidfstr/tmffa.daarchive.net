************************************************************************ 	As 
Amy walked into the classroom on Monday morning she saw Ryoko waving at her from 
her seat next to Tenchi.  Amy smiled and waved back, sitting in her chair at the 
back in the middle of Gia and Raquel.
	"Students!" the teacher called "I have an announcement to make.  Two weeks 
from now is the International Martial Arts Competition.  Amy your group is 
competing right?"
	"We're planning to enter but we need another member, we're holding a 
competition on Friday for our fourth member." Amy replied.  "I know the perfect 
person to be the newest member of the Black Tigers too." She thought.
************************************************************************
	Ryoko met up with Amy at lunch time and asked her,
	"Amy how would you, Gia and Raquel like to come over this Saturday to 
Tenchi's house we're having a party and Tenchi said you and the girls could 
come." 		"Sure, as long as you join the competition to become our 
newest member"
	"Is their any specific areas the competition will be focused on?" Ryoko 
asked.		 "Hand to hand combat and sword fighting"
	"Okay sure I'll try it out."
************************************************************************
	Ryoko knocked on the door of the shrine.
	"Come in." Katsuhito's voice came from inside, Ryoko walked in and bowed.
	"How may I help you Ryoko?" he said looking over the top of his glasses.
			"I'm entering a competition this Friday and I need to learn 
some more sword techniques.  So I was wondering if you could help me."
	Tenchi is getting lazy he needs someone young and energetic like you to 
spar with, why don't you join him for the week." Ryoko's eyes lit up.  She 
hadn't thought of that.
	"Thank you Lord Katsuhito." She then bowed and teleported to the Masaki 
house roof where Ryo-ohki joined her.
	"Guess what Ryo?" Ryoko asked scratching the cabbit behind the ears.
	"Miya?"
	"I get to train with Tenchi for the rest of the week."
	"Miya, miya, miya!"
	"You know I'll have a good time." Ryoko said starting to laugh evilly 
while Ryo-ohki sweat dropped.
	Ayeka ran into the kitchen where Sasami was setting the table for dinner.  
	"Where is that monster woman?"
	"Oh she's with Tenchi at the shrine." Sasami replied.
	"What!" Ayeka ran out of the house and towards the shrine like a bat out 
of hell.  As she neared the shrine she heard sounds of fighting.  Then she saw 
Ryoko charging at Tenchi.
	"Ryoko what are you doing attacking Lord Tenchi!" They both stopped and 
stared at her.  Ayeka opened her mouth to again yell at Ryoko but Tenchi 
interrupted her.
	"Ayeka, Ryoko is just helping me practice."  Tenchi said.  Ryoko stood 
behind Tenchi and stuck her tongue out at Ayeka.  Ayeka fumed but went on,	
	"Sasami says dinner is ready."
	"Great let's go Tenchi." Ryoko said grabbing Tenchi and teleporting to the 
house.  Ayeka's screams could probably be heard in Tokyo
	"Ryoko, you come back here this instant! Ryoko!"
********************************************************************************
	Finally it was Friday and time for the competition and Ryoko was ready to 
win.  Amy walked up to Ryoko and slapped her on the back.
	"Ryoko from what I've seen there's no competition except for this one guy.  
You can't let him beat you, because from the beginning Black Tigers has been an 
all girl thing and I want to keep it that way."
	"Sure I don't think I'll have a problem.  I've been training with Tenchi 
all week." Amy rolled her eyes and pointed at the gym.
	"The competition will be held in there.  There's already a huge crowd in 
there."
	When it was time for Ryoko's first fight she saw Tenchi and the rest of 
the Masaki household in the stands cheering for her (Yes even Ayeka).  The fight 
went by in a blur as Ryoko took down her opponents easily until there was only 
on combatant left.  A young man walked up to her and bowed.  
	"This must be the guy Amy warned me about." Ryoko thought.
	"Begin the first round, hand to hand combat." Gia announced.  The man 
charged at Ryoko but she grabbed his arm and flipped him over, throwing him to 
the ground where he lay stunned unable to get back up.
	"K.O. first round goes to Ryoko." Amy yelled to be heard over the cheering 
of the crowd.  The man finally got up and picked up his bokken getting ready for 
the second match.
	"Begin the second round, swordplay." Raquel said.  The young man brought 
his sword forward and lashed at Ryoko, she blocked the attack and was forced on 
the defensive.
	Tenchi watched from the stands, when he saw that Ryoko was losing ground 
he grew disgruntled.  Ryoko had practiced all week so that she could win this; 
there was no way she could lose this now.  Tenchi summed up his courage and 
yelled out,
	"Come on Ryoko remember what we practiced.  I know you can beat him, do it 
for yourself Ryoko." Ryoko heard Tenchi and suddenly was filled with 
determination.  She saw an opening and went on the attack.  The young man was 
surprised at how quickly the fight started to turn to Ryoko's advantage.  Ryoko 
swept her sword in an arc and disarmed him winning the fight.  The audience 
roared at the spectacular show the two put on as they shook hands.  
	Amy stepped up with a smile on her face along with Gia and Raquel.
	"And the newest member of the Black Tigers is Ryoko Hakubi!" Amy announced 
as she pulled out a small container filled with ashes.  Amy dipped her finger in 
the ashes, and on Ryoko's shoulder made four slated slashes.
" We rose from the ashes to meet our challenges, from these ashes we draw our 
power, and to ashes shall we send our enemies.  Ryoko Hakubi do you accept the 
responsibilities of the Black Tigers?" Ryoko nodded and Amy smiled and put a 
black smudge on Ryoko's nose.  Ryoko beamed as Tenchi and the others came down 
to congratulate her.  She introduced her friends to her family and they all 
cheered for her.
********************************************************************************
After dinner Ryoko went up to the roof and gazed at the stars.
	"Ryoko?" Ryoko turned her head slightly and saw Tenchi standing there. 
"You were great today in the fight." Tenchi commented. Ryoko beamed
	"Thank you, but I owe it all to you you're a great sparring partner." 
Tenchi blushed slightly and scratched the back of his head laughing nervously
	"Well actually I wanted to ask you something about that.  Um... I was 
wondering if you would keep sparring with me." Ryoko jumped up and gave Tenchi a 
giant hug. "Of course Tenchi and thank you for asking."
	"Oh no what have I done now." Thought Tenchi.
