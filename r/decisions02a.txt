    It was a Saturday and Ryoko was at Amy and the others house.  
The others had gone out for a while and Amy was fixing lunch for 
when they came back.
    Ryoko looked around the house; it was beautiful every room had 
paintings, pictures and other valuables from around the world.  
She had learned a lot about her new friends, none of them had any 
known living relatives and all of them were rich because of the 
money their dead relatives left them.
 Each of the girls had a part time job even though they had a lot 
of money Amy sang at clubs, Raquel painted and Gia wrote poems. 
Also whenever a martial arts tournament was held they would enter 
and since they started were undefeated.
 As Ryoko was looking at some pictures near the kitchen one of 
them caught her attention, it was a picture of Amy about two years 
ago standing next to a young man. He was tall, same complexion as 
Amy, had dark green eyes and short blonde hair. "Hey Amy who's the 
guy?" Amy looked to where Ryoko was pointing and quickly averted 
her eyes away from the picture.  "It's no one." She said sadly.
  Ryoko decided to drop the subject since she was obviously not 
going to get any more information.  Just then the others walked in 
and they sat down to eat lunch.

  Near Tokimi's domain the robed figure sat in his ship 
contemplating his attack, as he was thinking D3 appeared next to 
him. " What are you here for D3?"
"Lady Tokimi asked me to give you a message, there has been a 
change in plans, she wants you to find out what Washu and Tsunami 
are hiding also she senses several other unregistered goddesses on 
the planet, you are to find them and bring them back."
"If Lady Tokimi wishes it, it shall be done.

Ryoko sat up on the roof looking at the stars remembering the time 
when she had traveled them. "They're beautiful aren't they?" Ryoko 
turned around to see Washu behind her. "You are doing well Ryoko 
you haven't been hanging all over Tenchi and you have avoided 
fighting with Ayeka."    
  "All I have to say is your plan better work mom."
  "Oh don't worry it will work." With that said she disappeared 
and left Ryoko to her thoughts.

Author's Notes: O.K. I know it was short but this was just to add 
some elements to the play. Who is the young man in the picture?  
What is the robed figures plans and who is he? Who are the other 
goddesses? And most of all what are Wash's plans? All this in the 
next episodes of DECISIONS! (I watch too much DBZ):)
