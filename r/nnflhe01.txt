No Need for the Loves of Heaven and Earth!
Chapter 1: To Break one's Promise


By: Evileyez


	Shinosuke backed away from Ayeka's door, biting his lip to hold back
tears.  He knew what she meant by that statement, she was going to follow 
Yosho
if he didn't come back.  (Why did he not return yet- how could he promise 
Aya to
be his bride when it was well known among the training barracks that he 
didn't
want to!?)O0o. thought Shinosuke.  Although well liked by the "common" 
persons
of Jurai, the nobility thought him to be little more than a 
half-breed....o0O(Is
that his excuse?!  Did he fight Ryoko not only for the sake of Jurai, but 
for a
reason to run away?  How could he do this to *her*?!).

	"Shinosuke, how long will you stand behind my door?" a voice asked.

	"AHHHHHHH!!!!!!" Shinosuke screamed, "Don't DO that! *serious*  Just how
long did you know I was standing here?"

	"About the time I started hearing the thunking sounds on the wall behind
my door (Thunking noises?)," explained the amused princess.  "I mean, where 
do
you think *those* came from," she said holding up a hand mirror.

	Sure enough, there were swollen lumps of red on his head. *comically*
"Owww...," whined Shinosuke with waves of tears on his face, upon the
realization that they were there.

	"Why were you standing there anyw-"

	"Ayeka," Shinosuke interrupted, "your promise!" (What?) "You never gave me
your promise yet- for the rings!  I figured out what I want you promise for 
me."

	"Shin," Ayeka groaned tiredly, "I am not in the mood for such childish
games and worthless promises."

	(She thinks of this that way?!?)O0o. thought Shinosuke.o0O(This whole
time...)  "Aya!  What are you saying?!  We *are* still children!" Shinosuke
shouted, eyes wavering after the blow she had verbally given him.

	"Still children?!" Ayeka shrieked, "After all that has happened we can
*never* be same as we once were!  Look at my sister!  Sasami tries so hard 
to
act happy for us, but she's not!  She should've been up on the ship before 
she
got to see any of the destruction that *Devil* caused upon Jurai, but she
wasn't!  Did you know she got lost?  Who knows what she could've seen during 
that time!"

	"Aya...please!" Shinosuke pleaded, his eyes shaking.  "Just
promise me on my ring that you won't leave Jurai anytime soon, that's all I
want..."

	Ayeka, about to coldly answer that request, looked at him.  Seeing his
facial expression, however, she softened her reply.  "Oh, Shin...you know 
that
is the one promise I could never keep," she whispered, "I'll promise you
anything save that one."

	"Ayeka- this is the one thing I will want from you, please do it. (I'm
sorry, Shin, but-) If you refuse... I *will* call into question, how you 
value
our friendship. (...) *sigh* I see.  Farewell, Highness," Shinosuke spoke, 
then
walked turned to walk away.

	"Wait!" He turned.  "I-I'll promise you that..." Ayeka sighed, defeated.
Walking towards her friend, she took hold of the red ring on his hand and 
swore,
"I swear on the ring I have for you, to not leave Jurai in the near future."
Similar to her ring after Shinosuke had promised on it, his flashed a bright
red.  Now, when one looked carefully at it, it would seem like a red flame 
was
burning within the bauble.

	But for how long will that flame last?


*****4 years afterward*****


	Shinosuke sighed and slumped onto his bed.  It was the Princess's
eighteenth birthday.  This day always depressed him ever since the year 
*that*
had happened.  The eighteenth birthday of Princess Ayeka made him remember 
the
days of innocence and laughter when they were young- just like all those
previous birthdays of both his and hers.  (We were so close back then...what
happened?  What made it all change?  It was all because of that bitch
Ryoko...*she* caused this; changed this.  Not to mention my "idol" who's at 
just
as much fault here.)O0o. Were his thoughts.  Shinosuke believed it was 
Ryoko's
fault for attacking Jurai and Yosho's for following her.  Because of that, 
he
hated them both.  When he thought about it, Shin knew how that it was a part 
of
growing up.  He eventually made his own friends at the Training Grounds and
Ayeka at her Palace.  Still, this particular day would make him reminisce of
those times.

	Walking over to his desk, he looked at the mirror.  His hair was still
short, for some reason, he was told as a child by his now dead parents to 
keep
it shortened.  His father and grandfather had kept it short, so respecting 
their
wishes, he did as he was once told .o0O(It's also because *she* liked it 
that
way, right?) and picked up a red ribbon.  Because the coming of age for the
Crown Princess of Jurai was a national event, the Royal Guard was to perform
extremely difficult drills with their weapons- a performance that he was in. 
  He
was supposed to wear his rank color, *red (*the rank akin to "private"- but
since he is in the Royal Guard, it's still pretty up there) on his head.  
About
to put in on, he spotted another red one, darker and made out of better 
quality
material.

*****

"So you are going to begin *real* training to become a Guard?" asked Ayeka,
smiling.

"Yeah!  It's so cool!  We get new uniforms and everything!" answered a 
clearly
excited Shinosuke, "I wonder when I'll get to fight?"

"When you do, I'll have to challenge you to a match!  Anyway, this is for 
you,"
Ayeka said while handing him a small rectangular box.

"Really?!" (Uh-huh ^_^, its so you can think of me when you are doing 
training.)
"Thanks a lot, Aya!" *sounds of laughter*

*****

	Staring at it for awhile, Shinosuke set aside the common one issued by his
Leader and placed it on the desktop, tying the one Ayeka had given him 
instead.
(I wonder if she'll even notice me)O0o. he thought bitterly.  Shinosuke,
belonging to House Seiryuu, had a rank among the nobility of Jurai but was
considerably lower than others of his House.  Certainly low enough to not be
considered proper audience for their beautiful Princess. (Hmmph...why is all
this caste crap so important to the nobility?)O0o. Shinosuke always felt
"different" from the others of his rank.  It was the subtle things, that 
caught
his attention.  One such thing was the way the servants referred to him as
"Shin".  "Shin" was his nickname, the name for only people who are close to 
him
call him by.  Yet no one else had thought this odd; Shinosuke was certain,
however, that if they had called one of his cousins by that "rude" way of
speaking, they would have been severely punished.  In fa-

BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG!

	"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHHHHHHH!" screamed Shinosuke in surprise, not
prepared to hear such a loud alarm.  "Ugh..." he muttered a moment later, 
"Maybe
I shouldn't have set it so loud." *<_< >_>* .o0O(Hope no one heard *that*
one...)

*****Ayeka's Dressing Room*****

	"Little Darling!  You look beautiful!" squealed Misaki, who then tried
reaching down for the ki-

	"Sister, before you even THINK of hugging Ayeka, please remember the hours
of dressing and makeup...," trailed the voice of Funaho, "But you are right, 
our
little Ayeka looks quite fair."

	"Thank you-" Ayeka said before she felt a tugging on her dress.

	"Big sister looks pretty!" said little Sasami.

	Ayeka smiled and patted her little sister's water blue hair.  Standing
before the viewing mirror, she looked at her reflection.  Her face was a bit
thinner and eyes smaller, but the biggest change was her hair.  It had been 
cut
with great ceremony the previous day.  The Priest had cut out a top layer in 
her
hair- much shorter than the rest of her hair, to signify the ending of a
childhood into adulthood, and then burned it .o0O(Much to the distaste of 
the
others in the room.  Burnt hair smell *shudder*) thought the princess.  Her
robes of ceremony were quite beautiful, and had taken years to find the 
right
colors of the silks for Ayeka, and then another year to make all of her many
layers. [Think of the Japanese court ladies that wear *many* layers of silk]

	(Shinosuke shall attend as well...right?  He was-...no, *is* my
friend...does he still consider himself a such?) Ayeka questioned.  (No, he 
does
not.  Yet who could blame him?  For it was *me* who drove him away, wasn't
it?)O0o. she thought bitterly.

*****

	Ayeka walked down the hall to her room.  Moonbeams shone on her body,
casting a white glow upon her- like a beautiful spirit.  (Ahhh...I'm so 
tired!
Trying to fly your ship by mere mental ability makes one's head hurt quite a
bit!)O0o. were her thoughts.  As she neared her quarters, the girl heard the
hurried whispers of the maidservants preparing her bed.

	"Of course I heard!  Who hasn't?" said the first maid.

	"The poor girl..." said the second, a matronly looking woman.

	"Well, *I* think that if she TRULY loved him, she would've followed him!"
spoke a third.

	"But didn't you see her when he left?  She was heartbroken!" the second
one protested.

	"Well, I have a bit of info that you might be interested in girls," the
third said. ("What?" the two others asked)  "Let's just say that she and her
little ...*mockingly* "friend" are-"

	"She wouldn't!" the first said, astonished, "One of her status associating
with one of *that* kind of legacy?"
*****
"The boy isn't pure Jurain..."
*****
	"Then please explain why they should both share a *Lovers Ring with that
boy? (*when people are given rings on Jurai, it's a symbol of forbidden 
love;
hence "Lovers Rings"- it is bracelets that are given for weddings and such)"

	At this point Ayeka stopped listening.  (How DARE they speak of us in such
a manner!  Is this what they think we are?  Lovers?!  We *are* just friends,
nothing more!  Or...am-... am I wrong?  Do our actions speak differently?)
Looking at her ring, Ayeka pulled it off and walked over to of the windows
.o0O(They *are* right in a way...I have waited too long.  When I can 
properly
handle my ship...I-...I'll leave Jurai!) and threw her ring out-... onto the
floor.

	"No...but I cannot throw this away...not now!" she cried out, falling on
the floor in a heap and picked it up....  Ripping out a strand of her thick
hair, Ayeka put it through the ring loop many, many times, slipped it over 
her
head- onto her neck, and hid underneath her robes.  "Not now..."

*****

	(It was after that incident that I truly began to avoid him...wasn't it?
That was when I realized that people were getting the wrong idea from 
us-...my
governess disapproved of us altogether as well...was it because...because he
isn't like the rest of us...?)O0o. Ayeka pondered, putting her hand to her 
neck
line.

	"Come Daughter," called Funaho, "your ceremony awaits you." *sharp glance
at Masaki* .o0O(Don't you dare...)  *nervous smile from Misaki*  
"Eheheheh..."
*sweatdrop* (Good girl...)O0o. *giggle* thought the First Empress.

*****after the ceremony*****

	"Oh come, *on* Shin!" joked a fellow Royal Guard, "Don't tell me that you
were naïve enough to actually believe the Crown Princess would talk to you
personally; because of what?  That pretty face of yours?" 
*HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA*

	Shin had been lying down on his bed, thinking over the days events.  The
drunken man's voice slowly faded away from the mind of Shinosuke.  He should
have been happier, like the rest of the Royal Guards trained well enough 
with
their weapons, to show off their skills to the Royal Family; as well as 
exchange
a few pleasantries with the Princess herself!

*****

	Crown Princess Ayeka had just finished her speech.  Her audience gazed at
her beauty with awe.  The air around her emanated an aura of dignity and 
royal
upbringing.  Although in actuality, she had been quite nervous and only the
feeling of the ring where she clutched both her hands made her calm.

	Looking up at Ayeka, Shinosuke gasped with surprise.  The Ayeka he had
played with as children had now grown up-

*****

	"Shin, are you even *listening* to me?" his roommate asked, interrupting
Shinosuke's thoughts, "Goddesses!  You act like such a baby Shin- stop 
pouting!"

	"Hmmph" muttered Shin, "and I am *not* pouting.  That's bunch of bull."
(This guy is *getting* to me...)O0o.  Digging his face into his pillow, his
thoughts on the Princess once more resurfacing.o0O(Couldn't she at least 
have
*acted* like she knew me?  Ayeka had been so distant and formal...damn it!  
Does
she really not remember me?!  At least she looked hot....  Shinosuke whapped
himself on the head .o0O(Dammit!  Not right now!  You're *supposed* to be
wallowing in self-pity!  And you have right to as well, besides weren't you
"over" her?  Wait a sec, you never were really *with* her to begin with- 
AARGH!)
He began to scream with frustration into the pillow.

	Shinosuke's "friend" looked over at him with a bemused expression, "Heh.
What a freak-" and got hit in the face with a pillow.

	"Shut up and go to bed."

*****Ayeka's Bedchamber*****

	Ayeka was happy.  Her speech went on without a flaw, and the audience
loved her!  Yet there was something else on her mind...something no one else 
was
to know...

*****Nighttime******

	The Empresses Funaho and Misaki quietly entered the bedchambers of Ayeka,
unnoticed by anyone and left as silently as they came- with a third in their
party now.

	That night, the Crown Princess Ayeka left Jurai accompanied by her younger
sister Sasami.  They were to find out the status of the Crown Prince Yosho 
and
return him to Jurai as soon as possible- though in reality, Misaki and 
Funaho
had done it in order to prevent the possible suitors that Ayeka would have 
due
to the absence of her fiancé.

	Ayeka stepped into the hollow trunk in the bridge.  The opening in the
wood closed and created darkness inside.  As she inhaled the sleeping gas- 
she
felt a terrible burning sensation just as her Ryu-oh took off.

	"Wha- what is this pain I feel on my heart?"


End Chapter One













	It is a dark room, with two figures standing in two spotlights that are
two shades of blue which are the exact same two that they prefer.  And in 
these
two lights, the two figures talk about the first two parts of Evil's story.
[You had to stop sometime...] .o0O(Oh just go bark up another tree) [Oh, I 
was
planning on doing that when she was older- however, if you insist-] .o0O(You
will NOT do ANYTHING to that little girl!  That poor girl has been through 
so
many bad lemons *shudder*) [*evil smile*] .o0O(*sweatbeads*)

Astrophe: You know Evil, this story is getting to be kind of-
Evil: Interesting?
Astrophe: Sappy- no offense...but is this going to be something like an 
Anne-
Book?
Evil: *indignantly* I will NOT write a lemon fanfic!  And it is not sappy!
Astrophe: If that's the way you are going to be- how about cheesy?
Evil: Man, it's only like that cuz I'm still building the snowball!
Astrophe: *raises eyebrows*  "Building the snowball"?  Is that innuendo?
Evil: *vainly tries to raise one- fails and brings up finger to do it 
instead*
Astrophe: *bemused expression*  So I see.
Evil: *twitch* Dude!  Don't go there, that's just so...
Astrophe: So me?
Evil: So like "Mal".
Astrophe: That's understandable.
Mal: I heard that!

	Fearing wrath from the "Mal", Astro and Evil flee the room leaving to sets
of tracks from their two spotlights that happen to be the two shades of blue
that those two- Ah, forget it...
