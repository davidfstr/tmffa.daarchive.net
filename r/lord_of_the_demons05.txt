     Disclaimer: I'm gonna make this short, sweet, and to the point. 
I was never, ever, ever, ever, ever under the employment of AIC or Pioneer 
(Although it would be cool!) I never had anything to do with Tenchi Muyo 
or anything related. And I cannot stress this part enough. I AM B-R-O-K-E. 
Suing would get you know where. I can't help that I love to write and I 
can't help that I like Tenchi Muyo either. So there you have it. I'm just 
a poor, defenseless fan, who is broke might I add, who is doing his two 
greatest loves in the world.

            	    Chapter 5: Zerohour on the Planet Hades

     Ryo-Ohki drifted through space for hours until Hades was finally a 
few miles away. Its desolate surface could be seen from the navigation 
window. Tenchi and the gang laid out a battle strategy as the planet slowly 
got bigger in the window. They all sat on the floor of the control deck in a 
circle listening to Washu.    
     "Okay, listen up, I've seen the power that he possess, it works with
whatever evil he is surrounded by so he will be at his best. Also, Tenchi, 
may I see your ring?"
     "Certainly," he said as he began to take it off slowly, making sure
not to trigger the transformation into his Juraian battle uniform. "Here you
go." She took the ring out from his hand and pulled a pillow along with a 
cylinder out from sub-space. The cylinder had a glass top that contained a 
six-pronged disk; the rest of the body was metallic. She opened the glass 
and set the ring on top of the prongs. She then set it down on the floating 
pillow and then pulled her computer out. The ring inside the glass started 
to glow green, then blue, then red as Washu typed frantically on her 
computer. She hit one more key on the transparent keyboard and opened the 
glass case to retrieve the ring. 
     "Here you are Lord Tenchi, your new ring," Washu said and handed 
Tenchi the ring. 
     "Huh, what do you mean by new Miss Washu?"
     "I mean that ring is now more powerful than it once was, and it 
should give you a good boost while you battle Atmos," she explained while 
putting up the cylinder and the pillow. Tenchi stared at the ring and he put
it in his pocket. 
     "What about the Light Hawk Wings? Will they be any more powerful?" 
Tenchi asked.
     "Of course, that ring is made to work off of the life energy given 
off by a Juraian tree, and since Jurai is so close to Hades, you'll get a 
real good power surge, maybe enough to shut Atmos up for good."
     "I sure hope so, right now I need it."  
     "The program installed into the ring must be monitored so I'll have 
to stay here with Ryo-Ohki and use a transmitter to communicate." She pulled 
out a small device from sub-space that was about the size of a hearing aid 
and handed it to Tenchi.
     "This won't explode will it?" Tenchi asked. Washu chuckled and shook
her head. Tenchi placed it in his pocket for safe keeping. 
     "Okay, we'll be hitting Hades soon so everyone get ready, I'm sure 
Atmos is cooking up one hell of a welcoming party," Washu ended the meeting 
with that and everyone got prepared. 

     Atmos stood in a bare field of dirt and boulders. He looked to the 
sky to watch for any sign of Ryo-Ohki. His red eyes followed the bleak excuse
for a sky from one horizon to another until he finally spun about and saw a 
red glowing object against all of the blackness. He smiled and uttered two 
things.   
     "Ryo-Ohki . . . Washu."  

     "Everyone, brace for the landing!" Ryoko yelled and they all clung 
to something. The entire craft shook violently and all of the lights went 
out.  Finally, after what seemed an eternity, Ryo-Ohki came to a stop. They 
looked around in the darkness of the spacecraft. Ryoko picked herself up 
from the floor and looked about.
     "Is everyone okay?" Tenchi asked.
     "Yes I believe so," Ayeka responded.
     "Ryo-Ohki, give me a visual," she commanded and the screen flickered
on reveling the tattered world of Hades. They looked at the serenity of the 
desert planet. The visual panned around the surface as everybody got up and 
looked at the picture in silence. Suddenly a black figure zoomed across the 
screen. Everyone jumped and stared at each other for a moment.
     "What on earth was that?" Ayeka asked as Ryoko shook her head. The 
camera panned in the direction the object headed until a dark figure showed 
up. The camera stopped and zoomed in on it. Washu gasped and stepped back.
     "Oh dear god, he is alive," she said blankly and almost stumbled 
over a loose suitcase behind her. She sat down next to it and kept her eyes 
locked on the image. Tenchi looked at her then at the image. He pulled the 
sword out of his pocket and gripped it.
     "It's time," he said and he walked to the door of the spacecraft. He
opened it and a wind picked up. They all watched Tenchi step out into the 
howling wind and the flying dust. They looked at Washu, then Tenchi as he 
walked toward Atmos, then each other. Sasami looked up to her sister and a 
tear or two came to her eyes. Ayeka wrapped her arms around Sasami as she 
started crying.
     "What's the matter?" Ayeka asked her younger sister. She sniffed and 
coughed as she managed to get her head up to look Ayeka in the eyes.
     "I don't wanna go out there, its to scary and I . . . I feel 
something terrible!" she yelled and Ayeka patted her on the head.
     "It'll be okay Sasami, you can stay here with Miss Washu and 
Ryo-Ohki."
     "(sniff) Really?"
     "Of course."
     "Thank you Ayeka," she said and gave her a hug. Ryoko smiled a bit 
and then walked out into the desert. Mihoshi was reluctantly next followed 
by Ayeka. Sasami looked toward Washu who busily typed on the computer. She 
took notice to her staring and smiled at her.
     "Don't worry, everything will turn out okay, you'll see," Washu said
comforting Sasami and patting her on the head. Sasami smiled and turned to 
the monitor where the magnification was turned off and she could see everyone
standing in front of Atmos.
     "Hey where's Mihoshi?" Sasami asked herself looking at the screen. 

     It was all a staring contest as Atmos and Tenchi stared at one 
another. The others stood behind Tenchi; Ryoko with her full battle suit on 
and Ayeka in hers. Tenchi however didn't put his on yet. Atmos put his hand 
forward and created a red, double-bladed energy sword. He blankly stared at 
Tenchi while he put the transmitter in his ear.
     *Tenchi, do you read?* Washu asked over the transmitter.    
     "Loud and clear Miss Washu."
     *Go ahead and put the ring on* He nodded and took the ring out of 
his pocket. A red flash crawled around it as he slipped it on. A sudden jolt 
of energy made Tenchi float into the air and the Juraian armor appeared on 
him in a blinding flash of light. He landed on the ground and brought the 
blade out of the sword handle. Another silent stand off occurred as the wind 
began to whirl around the loose dirt. 
     Atmos disappeared and they all frantically looked around for him. 
Ryoko and Washu both gasped at the same time.
     "Tenchi above us!" Ryoko yelled as Atmos came out of the sky and 
created a crater where everyone once was. They all scattered as Atmos got up
and flew at Tenchi. They locked swords and the energy given off by both grew.
Washu stared at all of the figures and then grew a look of confusion.
     "Something's wrong," she muttered to herself. "This isn't like the 
Atmos I grew up with, it can't be."
     Tenchi and Atmos broke off and Tenchi made a thrust at Atmos. He 
dodged and attempted to slice Tenchi's head off by twirling around. Tenchi 
ducked and then tripped Atmos. He fell with a loud thud and Tenchi brought 
his sword up. He threw it down aiming for Atmos' head but he rolled out of 
the way before Tenchi killed him. Atmos threw himself up and fired an energy 
blast at Tenchi. He jumped out of the way as the blast hit the ground in a 
fiery explosion and Ryoko came flying through the fire. 
     She created her beam sword and slashed at Atmos. It cut his face 
while he escaped and red blood trickled out. He stared at Ryoko in fury and 
flew at her at full speed. He tackled her and threw her into a boulder. She 
lay in a heap as Tenchi came behind Atmos but was mule kicked by him. Tenchi 
went flying into the air and came crashing down to the hard ground. Atmos 
narrowed his eyes and fired a blast at Tenchi. 
     It caused an explosion where he was lying and Washu gasped. But 
Tenchi stood firm with the Light Hawk Wings out. He lowered them and brought 
out the sword. He ran at Atmos and made a blind swing for his head. Atmos 
ducked and slashed at Tenchi's back as he ran past. He missed and Tenchi 
stopped himself by sliding in the dirt. He used the momentum to make a 
stronger run at Atmos. This time he jumped into the air and made a downward 
chop only for it to be met with Atmos' red energy sword. Tenchi landed on the
ground as the energy popped and crackled from both blades being held 
together. 
     Tenchi jumped back and made a flying thrust at Atmos. It was a hit as
the sword came out of Atmos' back. Tenchi had impaled Atmos with the sword. 
     "Lord Tenchi!" Ayeka yelled in joy. Ryoko got up out of the rubble 
from the boulder and saw Atmos lying in a heap. A giant smile came across her
face as she flew at Tenchi. 
     "Tenchi!" she called but ran into Ayeka. They both fell over and 
began to yell at each other. Tenchi sighed and heard Washu come over the 
transmitter. 
     *Good work Tenchi, I knew my little invention would come in handy.* 
Washu said pleased by his performance.
     *You did great Tenchi!* Sasami yelled out. Tenchi smiled and turned 
to Atmos. He stared at his body and sighed.
     "Do you honestly think it's over, boy," a voice behind him said. 
Tenchi's eyes widened as he heard Ryoko and Ayeka's argument die out.
     *Tenchi, my god, I can't explain it . . . but that wasn't Atmos you 
killed, it was . . .* 
     "A dummy, made by yours truly." Tenchi spun around and suddenly had a
hand grasp his throat. He looked into the ice blue face of Atmos, who smiled 
gleefully as he tightened his grip. Tenchi started to gasp for air before 
Atmos raised him off the ground and threw him down. 
     Washu typed frantically on her keyboard while Sasami stared worriedly
at the monitor. 
     "What the hell is this all about?" she angrily asked herself. But 
then an alarm sounded and Washu looked at the screen terrified beyond 
rational thought. 
     "Oh my god, he changed the system."
     
     Tenchi got up after being thrown and brought his sword out. He stood 
ready while Atmos merely laughed. 
     *Tenchi watch out, he changed the system embedded in . . .!* Washu 
yelled but the transmitter died before Tenchi could hear the rest.
     "What does that mean? Miss Washu, come in!" he yelled back but he was
then raised into the air and a blue beam came out from his stomach. He 
screamed in pain as it flew into Atmos' palm.
     "It means to watch out because all of the energy you gathered from 
the Juraian trees from the power of that ring is now mine, including your own
life force!" Tenchi screamed his head off as the last ounce of his energy 
escaped him. He fell to the ground in a smoking mass. Atmos began to laugh as
bolts of red energy crawled al over him. 
     "Perfect," he said as he began to walk toward Ryo-Ohki. Ryoko flew at
him with her energy sword out but she was stopped by a shield that protected 
him. He looked back at her and laughed.
     "Ryoko, you've gotten weak over the years, what's the matter?" he 
asked and then threw her off using his energy. He then began to bend over 
slightly. He grabbed his head and began yelling in pain. 
     He brought his arm away from his head and it started to pulsate. 
Suddenly it grew larger than Atmos' entire body. Then the other arm did the 
same. Soon his chest grew and his legs followed. His head grew out also and 
by the time the transformation was complete he was over eight hundred feet 
high. His booming laugh echoed as he turned around. 
     "And so it shall begin, and then it shall end," he said and pointed 
his arm out toward the sky. 
     Washu watched the monstrosity point his arm at the sky and she 
quickly typed some things into her computer.
     "The orbit of Jurai is like so and right now he is building up all 
of that energy from the four moons around this planet . . . hmmm, by the 
time it takes then, damn, he has a straight shot at Jurai."
     Atmos formed a small ball of energy in his palms and four bolts of 
energy came flying at it. Atmos fazed out of the giant and left it set in 
stone. He floated down to Tenchi who was now barely standing up. He carried 
the sword with him as he ran at Atmos and brought it over his head. Atmos 
smiled as Tenchi threw it down and he caught the blade in his hand. 
     "The boy with the Light Hawk Wings eh? Nothing but a pathetic human,"
Atmos said and threw Tenchi into a rock. Atmos was soon surrounded by wooden
cylinders.
     "Who invited you princess?" he asked and he charged up his power. 
The cylinders exploded into splinters and Atmos fired a beam of energy at 
Ayeka. She was hit and was thrown back into a rock. Atmos continued his trek
toward Ryo-Ohki.
     "Miss Washu!" Sasami yelled as she began to cry.
     "Don't worry, Ryo-Ohki, can you escape?" Washu asked. Ryo-Ohki meowed
in a disapproval and Washu slammed her hand down. 
     "Washu?"
     "I hope Mihoshi is still out there."
     "Washu, I'm going to stop him from getting you!" Sasami yelled and 
ran out of the ship. Washu was about to stop her but didn't. 
     "Thank you Sasami." Washu typed in some more and she soon disappeared
from Ryo-Ohki. 
     Sasami walked out of the open hatch and stood in front of Atmos. He 
stopped and looked down at her.
     "Don't stand in my way little one, I don't want to hurt you."
     "I'm . . . not gonna . . . move," she said in panic. Atmos sighed and
pushed her out of the way with a small blast of energy. He walked up to the 
hatch of Ryo-Ohki and looked inside. 
     "I can't find Washu!" he yelled and slammed his hand into the wall.
"Damn you Washu!" He walked away and Ryo-Ohki disappeared. Mihoshi screamed
and startled Atmos. 
     "Wh--where did you come from!?"
     "Well, I . . . I was behind uh, Ryo-Ohki and then it. . . disappeared
and then I . . . I . . . oh please don't kill me!" she pleaded. Atmos stood 
confused and he blasted her with a small bit of energy as well.
     "I wont kill anyone but I will knock you out and give you new 
memories. You wont remember me and Jurai will be all mine," Atmos said and he
began to laugh evilly.
