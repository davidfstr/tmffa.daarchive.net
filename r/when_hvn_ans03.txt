	"So Kiyone, what did you want to talk about", Tenchi asked.  They had been 
walking through the woods for a few minutes now and neither one of them had said 
a thing.  "Tenchi...well...I just wanted to...say that I'm sorry, for what 
happened at the fair a few months ago, I never had a chance to apologize for 
wrecking everything for you..."  "Oh that...well...heh...you did give me quite a 
scare when you and the other girls showed up, but it's all right, really if 
anything, I should be the one to apologize for getting so angry"  "Oh...well 
that's a relief" Kiyone replied still thinking of a way to tell Tenchi her 
feelings.  "I also wanted to apologize for my behavior lately...I haven't been 
myself these past few days."  "That's okay Kiyone, you said it yourself, your 
job has been putting a lot of pressure on you lately, these things happen to my 
father often so I'm used to it."  "Besides, if anyone should apologize for what 
happended on the day of the fair, it should be me...I acted like such a jerk 
with Sakuya around" He looked off in the distance and thought about his lost 
love.  Kiyone knew how it must hurt him having lost Sakuya so suddenly.  

	He regained his composure and said, "Really, I thought you were getting a 
little tired of being around us Kiyone...like maybe we were getting in your way 
with your job"  "No Tenchi, that's only Mihoshi, and I couldn't get bored with 
being around everyone"  They kept walking for a few minutes and Kiyone couldn't 
help but take in the scenery, although it was late, she could still see the 
colors of fall and it was simply beautiful to her.  "It really is nice around 
this time of the year Tenchi, there's just something about the air in Fall...I 
could just wander around here for hours and not want to go home"  Kiyone tried 
to buy some more time before she went any further.  "Yeah...it does get to you"  
The trees were letting go of their leaves around this time of the year, and the 
wind blew just right through your hair, and if you were quiet long enough, you 
could hear it tell you a few secrets.   

	Again there was a bit of awkward silence.  (Oh, what am I doing...this is 
so silly...I'm a grown woman...not a little schoolgirl...why can't I just tell 
him how I feel?  What am I so afraid of?)  She was so 
deep in thought she didn't notice the stump in the ground and nearly fell over 
as she tripped over it.  Tenchi felt that there was more to Kiyone's story than 
she was saying.  "Kiyone...what's really bothering you, please tell me."  (Oh 
no, he's on to me...what do I do? The officer thought)  "Well...it's just 
that..."  (Well girl...it's now or never, you may never get another moment like 
this alone with him again,do you want to lose him?  No, it's just that, what was 
it that Vin-Roc had said to me, "If you say nothing, then you will know 
nothing") Her heart was racing almost to the point she felt it would burst and 
its contents would spray forth without every getting a chance to make sense of 
the jumbled mess that was out in the open.  "All right, but just hear me out 
first before you say anything.okay?" Tenchi nodded and they stopped walking and 
faced each other.  

	"Lately Tenchi, I have had a lot of things on my mind.but more so than 
others was you.  I just wanted to say that I enjoyed all the times we had 
together...and it's just that after seeing you so angry that day...I wished that 
I had never been a part of what the others did that day.  I never 
wanted to make you angry, you've always been so kind and patient with us, I mean 
here we all invaded your life, and you took us all in."  

	Tenchi was still listening and didn't notice Kiyone take a few steps 
closer to him.  "In all my life Tenchi, I never met another man with as kind as 
a heart as yours, never knew someone who could put up with so much and never 
give up.  I...I know I must not be making a whole lot of sense but..."  "What 
I'm trying to say Tenchi is...is...(Why can't I say it...why can't I tell him 
what's in my heart...why can't I just take a chance?)  She took a deep breath 
and took hold of Tenchi's hands and held them firmly.  Tenchi's 
pulse shot way up and he felt hot all over.  Kiyone realized that it was now or 
never.  "Tenchi, what I'm trying so hard to say is that I think...no I know 
that...well...I've fallen for you...more so than with any other man I ever knew.  
I just needed you to know that"  Kiyone smiled so warmly at Tenchi feeling as if 
a tremendous weight had been lifted off her shoulders.  
	Tenchi just stared at her for a moment...and drew his hands away from her.  
"Kiyone...look, I..."  (Of all the people, Kiyone likes me too, oh man...what do 
I do now?)  "I...I'm sorry Kiyone...but right now, I just don't know, after I 
lost Sakuya, I felt like I could never love someone again.  I won't lead you on 
Kiyone, you're too good for that...all that I'm saying is, I'm just not 
ready...I'm sorry"  Kiyone felt the world around her come crashing down...she 
started to cry.  "Please Kiyone, don't cry...I'm..." Before he could finish, 
Kiyone shook it off and smiled amidst the tears, "Really Tenchi <sniff>...I'm 
glad, glad that I finally <sniff> had the chance...and the courage to tell you 
how I feel...and that <sniff> means more to me than you could imagine..." 
"Kiyone..." he began to reach out for her.  ".<sniff>.good-bye Tenchi." With 
that, the officer took off at top speed, apparently heading back towards the 
house.  "KIYONE WAIT!!!!!"  Tenchi shouted after her, but she was already gone.  
He tried to run after her, but his legs failed him.  Instead, he felt himself 
fall to the ground.

	On his knees he pounded the earth, and though there was not a cloud in the 
sky...the ground beneath him was wet from his tears.  "I did it again, I lost 
someone else in my life...why can't I just make the right choice!!!!!" He 
shouted to no one in particular.  (Why...why can't I just be a man about 
things...why must I always run from everything?)  (Well...isn't that what you 
want...to never be a man...just to be a boy.  To never be responsible for your 
actions, to always run about and be free.  To never admit when you're in love.  
And the girls...well...you know you mean the world to them.  Why choose, why not 
just keep up this charade, and you can have them all forever. That's what you 
want isn't it?)  "No...that's not what I want...that's not what I want." 

	He needed some help, some guidance, what he needed...was a miracle.  
Tenchi cast his eyes heavenward and noticed how the stars shone so brightly 
tonight.  There was a story that his mother had read to him, an American story 
for kids.  There was a saying that he always remembered, but never believed in 
trying it...till now.  He closed his eyes, opened his heart and began 
"Starlight, starbrite, first star I see tonight, wish I may, wish I might, have 
the wish I wish tonight...if nothing more, I just ask that I be given the heart 
and the courage I need to do the right thing...please...whoever may be 
listening, please, believe in me"  Picking himself up from the ground, Tenchi 
cleared his eyes and began the walk back home.  What he never noticed was that a 
shooting star in the sky, just so happened to be passing by and heard his 
prayer.  

*****************************************************************************

	Kiyone was still running at top speed.  (Can't stop, must keep going.)  
She ran past the house...knowing that this may be the last time she may ever be 
here again.  She stopped at the lake where her ship was parked.  (Do I really 
want to do this, do I really want to run?)  Without a second thought, she made 
her decision...she summoned up the Yugami from under the lake.  After boarding, 
she looked back at the house one last time and punched the ignition button.  
Kiyone inputted the coordinates to the one place 
she felt she could go to for...well for anything.  "Right now, any place is 
better than here...good bye everyone...<sniff>"  Kiyone stared out the window in 
the cockpit..."Tenchi..." The Yugami tore across space at an incredible rate.  
(Guess Washu fixed the upgrade.)  After a short time, the Yugami 
reached its' destination and docked.  The occupant stepped out and began heading 
towards her final destination.

*****************************************************************************

	"WHAT!!!?!?!??!"  The space pirate shouted at Washu.  "You mean to tell 
me...that he's still alive?"  The look of disbelief across Ryokos' face was 
nothing short of complete.  "Yup, I told you, you might not like what I had to 
tell you."  Washu leaned back into her chair.  It had taken a full hour for 
Washu to explain in detail how she came about to know of Vin-Roc's continued 
existence, how the fact that she had kept up to date with the Inter-Galactic 
bounty hunters list to see if Ryoko was still number one.  
When she found out that there was another more hunted than her accomplice.she 
sought out the identity of the new most wanted individual in existence.  When 
she had discovered it was Vin-Roc, she knew that this fact would simply drive 
Ryoko over the edge.  "Ryoko...please understand...if I had told you he was 
still alive, you may have gone off and done something rash."  "You mean like 
this?!"  Ryoko threw an energy beam, which came within inches of beheading 
Washu.  She missed of course, but she simply wanted to show her anger in the 
fact that this bit of news had been kept from her for so long.  


	"Washu...how dare you...you knew how I felt for him, you knew how much I 
cared for him..." the tears began to fall from her eyes.  "Look, I'm sorry...but 
what's done is done...so now that you know he's still alive, what do you plan on 
doing?"  "I...I...don't know" Ryoko held her hands over her face feeling alone 
and she didn't like it one bit.  "He's...<sniff>...still out there..." Ryoko 
began to go for the door.  "Where are you going Ryoko?"  Washu began to get up 
from her chair.  "I just need to think about a few 
things, got a problem with that?"  "Nope." With that, Ryoko was out of her lab 
and out of the house.  

	She was floating over the lake, which for whatever reason was still 
rippling.  (What happened here...hey...where's Kiyones' ship?  I thought she was 
just talking with...Tenchi?  No, it couldn't be...or could it?  Was Kiyone 
getting the hots for my Tenchi?)  The space pirate gripped her fists tightly, 
but just as suddenly let them fall by her side.  (My Tenchi...now that's 
funny...all these years I've tried to make him mine...yet I never realized just 
how much I was forcing myself on him.  I never gave him a chance to breathe, 
never gave him a chance to say how he felt.  I was too busy trying to seduce him 
away from that pesky Aeka...and now Kiyone...what happened that would make her 
run away...if that's what really happened.  Hmph...knowing Tenchi, he probably 
got cold feet on her.  Maybe it's time that I accepted the fact that...well I 
may...<sniff> never get Tenchi...)  

	"DAMMIT!!!"  The pirate shouted but there was no audience to ask whom it 
was directed to.  "Oh Tenchi...why does it have to be this way...I loved you..." 
she fell to the lake and floated only inches from the surface.  (But now...now I 
find out that he's still out there...somewhere...but what should I do?  I mean I 
cared about him so very much, I died that day I saw 
the base explode along with the one person I cared for...more so than my very 
life.  Then I found you Tenchi, and you helped me forget him...but now...you 
have someone else for you, and she is a good choice...if you make one that is.  
Well then, I guess there's only one thing left to do.  I guess it's time this 
stubborn pirate accept defeat and move on.  If Tenchi won't accept me...then I 
still want him to be happy...even if it won't be me that makes him happy.)
	
	Ryoko floated back to the ground a few hundred feet away from the house.  
She had a new look of determination on her face.  (Three hundred years is a long 
time to be alone.too long.)  She was just a few steps away from the door when 
she heard a voice from behind.  "Ryoko..."  "Tenchi..." For a while they just 
stared at each other.  Tenchi was filled with a new determination himself.and he 
knew what he had to do.  He felt that he at least owed Ryoko an explanation as 
to what it was he had to do.  Ryoko had a look of strong determination on her 
face amidst the tears she shed just a short while ago.  She knew what she had to 
do and she too felt that she at least owed Tenchi an explanation as to what it 
was she had to do.  "We need 
to talk" they spoke in unison much to their surprise.  They both nodded 
understanding the need to discuss these newly developed matters.  Ryoko was the 
first into the house, then Tenchi who quietly closed the door behind them.                   


	It was late into the night, and all the inhabitants on the Tildrin 
*****************************************************************************
	Space Station were fast asleep, all that is except for one.  Vin-Roc was 
somewhat peacefully watching his holo-screen this time not intent on 
blasting it to atoms.  He was drinking away in another vain and doomed attempt 
at getting drunk.  The music was well up past most humanoid standards and had 
already caused many of the inhabitants to move to another part of the station.  
"Well...what do we have to watch this evening...BURP!!!!!"  As he was going 
through all the available programs.which at this night was either Galacto-
Infomercials or old re-runs of poorly done comedies when he heard a pounding at 
his door.  "Uhhhhhh...who the hell is it?!?!"  There was no response.then the 
banging began again.  "Noi`jitat!"  He got up from his seating and went over to 
answer the door.  "...hi" was all that Kiyone managed to get out forcing a weak 
smile.  He could tell that she had been crying for quite sometime by the way her 
mascara was running.  "I wasn't expecting to see you again so soon...come on in, 
oh and don't mind the mess." With that, the door closed behind them.     

*****************************************************************************              
My, my, my.how things have unfolded.  In the next exciting episode:

Tenchi and Ryoko have a few things to discuss.
