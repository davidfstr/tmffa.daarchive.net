CUE OPENING CREDITS SONG:"Boku wa moto Pioneer" by Chisa Yokoyama(with
much the same look as OVA2 opening but including Kiyone, Seion, Demi,
The Knights, Nagi, Misaki, Megumi and all those adorable little cabbits.
SCENE: The Masaki Shrine. Tenchi's Kendo club is practicing and training
along with Seion, Yosho, and Asaka. Kamadaki is hiding in the well from
you know who.
HAPPO: Why are we practicing when it's such a good day out?
TENCHI: You want to beat the Nerima Kendo Club don't you? Somebody needs
to shut the "Blue Thunder" up!
KEICHI: It's not like there's anything going on in Okyama today anyway
and-(Whack! on his head)
SEION: Shaddap and defend yourself.
ARASHI: You're right. There's no girls around here anyway, ne, Tenchi.
TENCHI: Well, I...uh...
SEION: Sure! There's a whole house full of 'em down there!(points to
Tenchi's house)
GEN: Yeah right! I'll bet one's a beautiful princess who loves Tenchi
soooooo much that she just can't stand the though of leaving Tenchi!
I'll take her of your hands! (Everyone laughs)
AEKA:(Offscreen) LORD TENCHI!(enters the scene) We're going to be
relaxing on the new beach that you and your father made for us. Why
don't you and your friends join us. Tell Kamadaki that Megumi will be
there.
KAMADAKI:(from the well) CRAP!
(Aeka leaves. All the guys look at each other and then....)
GEN: SHE'S MINE!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SFX: Eeeeeeeeeeoooo!
EPISODE 32: NO NEED FOR MOMMY!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SCENE: The "Masaki Beach" (actually just a big sand box next to the
lake) All the girls are on the beach. 
RYOKO: Isn't this great, Aeka? Reminds me of the time during the
rebellion when we were at that
resort.
AEKA: Yes, it does.
GEN:(offscreen) I said I've got the one with purple hair!(Here they
come!)
ARASHI: Then I'll take the spikey hair girl with the big ti-
KEICHI: I WANT THAT TEAL TRESSED GODDESS!
HAPPO: Can I have the blonde?
SEION: Get lost, ya hentai creep! She's mine. Take that scary lookin'
chick over there!(shoves him toward Nagi where his head happens to land
in between her thighs.) 
HAPPO: Uh, hello. And you are?
NAGI: (blushing but trying to act all serious because if she looked like
she was having fun then
people would loose respect for her and then it would just be work, work,
work all the time!) My
name's Nagisa..er..I mean Nagi! And your dead!(Just before Nagi pretends
like she's gonna kill
him a gigantic shadow falls over the "beach". When everybody looks up
they see the most powerful
 ship in the Jurian fleet-Tsunami. By the way, where was this ship when
Kagato took over the Jurian Throne. Hmmmmmmm....I guess I'll have to
make up something. Anyhoozel, as the gang looks up in amazement Seion
grabs Gen by the gi and says the following...)
SEION: YA DIDN'T SEE NUTHIN'! YA GOT THAT? YA DIDN'T SEE NUTHIN'! I know
where you live!(holds up a map of Okayama) I KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILIES
LIVE!(teardrops all around, cept for Seion of course)
SASAMI:(kawaii lil' gasp) SHE'S HERE! SHE'S HERE, AEKA! 
AEKA:(slightly annoyed tone) Great. She's here!
GEN: Ya mean to tell me that Aeka here is an alien?
SEION: Sure is. Everybody in this house is, 'cept for Tenchi's dad. But
you guys aren't going to tell anybody, are you?
HAPPO: And how are you going to stop us.(suddenly a bright light comes
up from beneath Happo and he suddenly turns into a watersprite) Nibbet!
WASHU: And remember this-I can get you anytime I want to!(the puppets
appear)
WASHU-A: Way to go, WASHU!
WASHU-B: Show'em who's boss, WASHU!(insert maniacal laughter)
SEION: Are we clear?
GEN, ARASHI, KEIICHI: Crystal.
HAPPO: Nibbet.(Transforms back into his oldself and they all head for
the hills)
TENCHI: Uh...see you guys tommorow? (As Tsunami settles just a few feet
above Ryo-oh, another Jurian ship, Ramia, appears. Ramia looks much like
Sasami's ship from Episode three of the TV series. As Ramia lands a
glowing sphere appears and comes to rest in front of the gang. When the
sphere fades we see two Jurian knights, Two Torabushi's and Her Royal
Highness the Queen Mother Misaki...who right away looks at Nagi, with
tears welling up in her eyes, and procedes to put a vice-grip hug on her
and says....)
MISAKI: OH MY DEAR SASAMI! YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH! YOU'RE AN EARLY
BLOOMER! NOT LIKE YOUR SISTER AT ALL! But what have you done to your
hair?! And that FACE PAINT! It doesn't become that pretty face of yours!
NAGI: WHAT?! Hey, Lady, I-
MISAKI: Mommy, dear. My name is Mommy. Now hold still while I clean you
up. (She takes out a hankerchef and procedes to clean the face paint of
Nagi's face and, in fact, she looks alot prettier without it. Just then
Misaki hears Sasami's KAWAII little giggle. When Misaki turns her head
she sights her little daughter. With that she tosses Nagi aside...right
into Ryoko. Both stop as if they ran face-first into a brick wall) My
little Sasami! Oh, what a relief it is to see that you haven't changed!
How have you been? I missed you so much!
SASAMI: I'm just peachy, Mommy!
MISAKI: And you're just as kawaii as ever!(she gives Sasami a hug)
SEION: Awww. Ain't that adorable? She still calls her Mommy.
AEKA: Don't encourage her, heathen!
MISAKI: AEKA! I will not have you talk like that! It's not kawaii! Now
apologize to the man!
AEKA:(groan) Gomen nasia Lord Sei-(Misaki gives her a disapproving look)
uh..[oh, no]..(deep breath)..(in an overly adorable voice) I'M SO SAWEY
MISTER MAKIBI!(all except the Royal ladies and Seion facefault)
MISAKI: That's more like it, my little Aeka!
SEION: Now apologize for the Government Employee tax hike.
AEKA: (still in the cute voice) NO WAY, STUPIDFACE! (or "Never shall I
submit to your request, you ignorant looking bombasitc buffon!" for
those who don't speak Kawaiiese)
SASAMI: Let me introduce you to everyone. This is Seion.
MISAKI: Ooooooo! You are cute!
SEION: REALLY, MY WIDDLE QUEEN?
MISAKI: Oh, please. You don't have to act like that! You're a man after
all.(looks him over. All of him) More so than my late husband! Who's the
lucky girl?
MIHOSHI: That would be me, my Queen!
MISAKI: Another cute one! You two are the most adorable couple I've
seen!
SASAMI: And this is Kiyone.
KIYONE: Greetings, my Lady. It's a pleasure to meet you!
MISAKI: (gives Kiyone a strange look)...Have we met before? 
KIYONE: Uh..No, ma'am.
MISAKI: Hmmm. Anyway, who's next.
SASAMI: This is Washu!
MISAKI: LITTLE WASHU!
WASHU: See, people! She got it right the first time!
SASAMI: And this is Tenchi!
MISAKI: Oh how-uh..average looking. I do hope that you're an extremely
kind-hearted young man.
TENCHI: Well I..uh..what I mean is...ah...I'm just...
MISAKI: Oh, he's such a shy one! Now that is cute!
SASAMI: Oh, Mommy! Here's someone you've always wanted to meet! Mommy,
meet Tenchi's grampa, Yosho!
YOSHO: Greeting, Misaki. How are you today, young lady
MISAKI: YOU'RE YOSHO? (you know that look Miz gets on her face when she
finds out that Fujisawa is a government employee on El-Hazard? Well,
that's the same look Masaki gets on her face) I've always wanted to meet
you!
SASAMI: Oh, Mommy, I almost forgot to ask! Why did you bring Tsunami
along?(As if she doesn't know)
MISAKI: Huh? Oh yes. That's right! Tsunami insisted on joining me. She
said it was very important.
TENCHI: Who's Tsunami?
TSUNAMI: (Offscreen) I am Tsunami, the ship of Jurai(The gang turns
around to see the ship Tsunami light up and transform into a beautifull
adult version of Sasami. All gasp in amazment. As she comes to a landing
the light fades. She then procedes toward Tenchi) You are the one named
Tenchi, correct? (Her lips come within less than an inch within Tenchi's
when she suddenly stops) It's a pleasure to meet you. Shall we go
inside?
TENCHI:(gulp!) Uh..heh-heh..sure Miss Tsuna-na-naaaaaa-(Seion whacks him
on the top of his head)-mi!(As the gang procedes to go indoors they
notice that Sasami is passed out)
AEKA: SASAMI!

SFX: Eeeeyoooo! (wood blocks)
(picture of Ryo-oki and Ken-oki in ship form bumping into each other)
=====================================================
COMMERCIAL BREAK
KAGATO:(off screen) How Tenchi Masaki eats a Reese's
TENCHI: Uh..well I...the thing is I.....I like you both just the
same....so it's unfair to..uh.. make me choose. Can't you two...uh..just
try to be friends? I..uh... can't choose between you. You're both so
perfect that it...uh..um..I uh...what I'm trying to say is-(Seion walks
into the scene, puts a bullhorn up to Tenchi's ear and says..)
SEION: WILL YOU PICK ONE ALREADY!
KAGATO: There's no wrong way...
TENCHI: Can't I just have you both?
KAGATO: ..To eat a Reese's!
=====================================================
SFX:Eeeeyoooo!(wood blocks)
(picture of the cabbits with a bunch of carrots slung over Ken-oki's
back)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SCENE: Sasami's room. Everyone is gathered around. Sasami has a wet
cloth on her head. She is still passed out.
WASHU: Stand back, people! Let me handle this!
AEKA: What's wrong with her, Washu?
WASHU: For the last time its-
TENCHI: WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT! Now what's wrong with her?
WASHU: It seems that she is suffering from a severe heat stroke.
MISAKI: Oh no!
TENCHI: Heat strokes aren't that bad, are they?
SEION: Not to my race. But to Jurians it's 95% fatal.
TENCHI: Why's that?
WASHU: Because the suface of Jurai is almost entirely shaded. The
surface is usually a cool 75 degrees. Rarely does it get into the 90's.
Seion's home world on the other hand has those crystal peaks and cities
which only intensify the heat. But they've adapted to it.
MISAKI: Please, Little Washu. Is there any thing you can do for my
little girl?
WASHU: Well there's one thing I can do, but I'm going to need help.
Tsunami, I'll need you. You too, Kiyo ol' girl. As for the rest of
you....get lost!(They leave) Alright, sis, It's all up to you.
TSUNAMI: I'll see what I can do.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE:Downstairs. The gang is talking to each other.
MISAKI: (with full waterworks) OH MY DEAR SASAMI-CHAN! SHE WAS ALWAYS MY
FAVORITE CHILD!
AEKA: First child within earshot, Mommy!
RYOKO: (in a mockingly baby voice) Foist tild wiffin eyosot, Mommie! Ha
ha! 
MISAKI: (PeeO'd) ARE YOU MOCKING MY LITTLE AEKA?!
RYOKO: Huh?
AEKA: She was picking on me, Mommy!
MISAKI: HOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF MY LITTLE AEKA! (Grabs Ryo ol' girl by
the hair)
TENCHI: Hey now! You guys shouldn't-
SEION: Kick her buckaneer ass, Your Highness! (the camera stays on
Tenchi and Seion while we see their faces react to the fight going on
off screen)
TENCHI: Alright! She's had enough! (the camera then shifts to where the
fight was. We see Ryoko standing over a spread eagle Misaki) Somebody
pick the Queen up!
RYOKO: Now who was rooting against me, Seion? (she gets up in his face)
SEION: (feining fear) Hey, Ryoko! (she sticks her fist in his face) Oh,
please..Oh please..(He quickly grabs her wrist, pushes it back and slams
Ryoko cranium first into the hardwood floor and sarcasticly says..)
Please don't kill me. That would break my freakin' heart.
RYOKO: (as if she was clubbed with a baseball bat) ...don't
worry..just...playing with you.....
TENCHI: You shouldn't be treating ladies like that, Seion.
SEION: Tell me when one shows up!
TENCHI: You know what I mean!
YOSHO: There's an old saying that you should know, Tenchi. "Never hunt
anything you can't kill."
TENCHI: Wow! Where's that from?
YOSHO: A Clint Eastwood film, I think. (Tenchi gives him that look) I do
have a life outside the shrine you know.  
RYOKO:...monkey?....funky monkey....
NAGI: Damn, why did Aeka have to pardon her? She's completely out of it
and I can't even get 10 measly Jurai for her worthless hide!
KEN-OKI: Chiao! Chiao-chiao!
NAGI: Well, I guess she'd have to share a cell with Ryoko!
RYO-OKI: Miyaaaa?
KEN-OKI: CHIAO! CHIAO-CHIAO! CHIAAAAAOOOOO!
NAGI: It was just a joke!
MIHOSHI: (teary-eyed) Seion, is little Sasami gonna be alright?
SEION: I couldn't tell you, Dear. But don't you worry. She's got Washu
up there.
RYOKO: (getting up) So why would a thing like a heat stroke be fatal?
SEION: Because the body's heat regulating mechinism shuts down and
disrupts the ability to keep from overheating. You can't even sweat
because your body is dried out. Me and you are the least likely to
suffer from it. From what I've heard you can survive in a vacum. But
poor little Sasami is just a kid. It could easily-
RYOKO: Don't say it..(a tear forms by her eye)
SEION: (to Ryoko) So you're not completely cold blooded after all.
RYOKO: Huh? I-it's just some-something in my eye.
SEION: Let me get it out! (quietly) Don't worry. I won't tell anyone. I
know how important your reputation is. (aloud) It was just an eyelash!
RYOKO: Thanks. 
MISAKI: So what'll happen to my little Sasami?
YOSHO: Should they be doing what I think they're doing, she should be a
Jurain Tree.
ALL: GAH?
YOSHO: Uhh..I mean HEALTHY as a Jurian Tree.
WASHU: (offscreen) HUZZAH! I've done it! (Washu, Kiyone and Tsunami come
down stairs)
WASHU-A: You're awesome, Washu!
WASHU-B: The greatest doctor ever, Washu!
KIYONE: Hey! We helped to you know!
TSUNAMI: I must say, she does like to be the center of attention.
MISAKI: IS MY WIDDLE SAMMY ALRIGHT?
KIYONE: She's fine, Mi'Lady but she's asleep now. She'll probably be
sleeping for the rest of the day.
MISAKI: OH, THANK YOU! (she puts the Misaki hug on all three of them.)
How can I ever thank you?
WASHU: Well, you can start with-
KIYONE: There's no need for that, Queen. Just doing my job. To protect
and serve.
MISAKI: You don't have to call me Queen any more. Just call me Misaki.
RYOKO: That's kind of you, Misaki.
MISAKI: You still call me queen!
RYOKO: Or what everyone here knows I can kick your rear-end!
MISAKI: But what about my guards? (Just then Misaki's guards appear
behind Ryoko)
RYOKO: EEP!(Ryoko tears through the door with her guards close on her
heels. Aeka, Seion and
Nagi try and do the same when Tenchi gets in their way)
AEKA: Lord Tenchi, it's rather hard to go after Ryoko when you are
standing in the doorway.
SEION: Push him down, Aeka.
TENCHI: There'll be time for fun tomorrow! Right now we need to get some
things arranged. We 
need someone to fill in for Sasami tonight for dinner. Any volunteers?
AEKA: I shall offer my services, Lord Tenchi.
ALL: NO!
RYOKO:(coming in the door with the four guards on her back) Get these
guys off of me!
SEION: Hey, guys! There's a twelve pack of AmaBrew in the fridge. You
each can have one!
GUARDS: YES! (they leave)
RYOKO: Seion? Can I have one two?
SEION: Since you'll have one anyway, go ahead.
TSUNAMI: I shall take Sasami's place tonight. 
TENCHI: Are you sure?
TSUNAMI: Gladly. Will the rest of you ladies join me? (All the girls
leave.)
TENCHI: (nervously) I've got a problem.
SEION: What is it?
TENCHI: I'm in love with three girls!
SEION: Doesn't sound like a problem to me.
TENCHI: Grampa, will you set him strait.
YOSHO: I'm inclined to agree with him.
TENCHI: What do you mean?
YOSHO: It's wonderful that you have enough love for three girls.
TENCHI: But I have to choose one.
SEION: Says who?
TENCHI: The law. I can only have one wife.
SEION: But Jurian law says you can have more than one.
TENCHI: But that only applies to members of the royal family. Guys like
grampa and me....wait a
minute. I'm a guy like me! Awww, but they'd fight over who got me first.
SEION: Ryoko doesn't care just as long as she gets you. Aeka will
probably want to be first, and
uh....who is the other one.
TENCHI: Tsunami.(Yosho and Seion facefault)
SEION: Why Tsunami.
TENCHI: She has something the others don't. I don't know what it is but
there's some thing in 
those eyes that makes me feel at peace. There's no hatred or malice or
even jealousy in her 
face.
SEION: That's beautiful, man. Does she feel the same way about you
though?
TENCHI: It seems that she was in love with me before I met her. You saw
what she tried to do.
YOSHO: There's more to her you have yet to learn. Well, I'd better be
going now. See you at 
dinner.
TENCHI: See ya, grampa.
SEION: Later, Lord Yosho.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: later that night. Tenchi's room. Tenchi is laying in bed. the
lights are out and he is 
looking up at the celing lost in thought when there's a knock at the
door.
TENCHI: Come in.(The door opens and Tsunami enters the room.)
TSUNAMI: Am I disturbing you, Tenchi-san?
TENCHI: No. Come on in. How's Sasami doing? 
TSUNAMI: I'm- I mean she's doing fine, Tenchi.
TENCHI: So what brings you here?
TSUNAMI: I just though I'd come in and vis-(her eyes start to well up
with tears) Tenchi, do you
remeber the first time you met Sasami.
TENCHI: Yeah.(Smiles) She told me she was looking for-
TSUNAMI: her big sister, right. And when she told you her name you said
that it was a cute
name and she started to blush.
TENCHI: (suprised) How did you know that?
TSUNAMI: There's some thing you must know about me Tenchi. Sasami and
I...We are..(she starts crying)
TENCHI: You're the same person,aren't you? Why are you telling me this?
TSUNAMI: Because as a part of Sasami we share the same thoughts the same
dreams, the same 
emotions and the same desires. She's a little girl and can't express
these emotions the same way
that I can. Tenchi....I love you. Please say the same to me. Show me
that you feel the same way.
Don't break my heart. I don't know if we could deal with it. Please.
(she embraces Tenchi.)
TENCHI: If I said otherwise it would be a lie. But I also love Aeka and
Ryoko the same way. I 
don't know if-
TSUNAMI: I don't care about that. You're a kind and generous man to take
people into your heart
unconditionally. You don't ask much from them.And all three of us would
die to protect you. If 
they really love you it wouldn't matter to them either. But I do have
one thing to ask of you..
TENCHI: What's that? (She places her hand on Tenchi's cheek and gives
him a gentle kiss.The scene quickly shifts to the stairs where Seion is
walking down them on his hands) Seion! Ya gotta help me!
SEION: What is it? (The scene shifts back to the bedroom)
TENCHI: This. What'll I do?
SEION: Just do what comes naturally-Aw hell! Just do what I would do!(He
pushes Tenchi in and
shuts the door.)
TSUNAMI: Don't worry Tenchi. We'll wait for that. You just want to sit
and talk?
TENCHI: Uhh..sure. Okay. Where should we begin?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SCENE: The Beach at night. Kiyone is looking at the moon over the lake.
KIYONE: (her thoughts) I don't know what Washu meant about that but I'll
have to deal with it.
NOBOYUKI: Are you waiting for me?
KIYONE: Oh, You're back! How was the trip? What did you bring me?
NOBOYUKI: Oh, just this!(he hands her a ring)
KIYONE: It's beautiful. What this for.
NOBOYUKI: It's what a man gives to a woman when he wants to marry her.
KIYONE: Well isn't that-you mean, you want to....me?
NOBOYUKI: I've only ever loved two women in my life. Achika was the
first. But I would like to
make sure you're the second. Will you marry me?
KIYONE: (crying)...yes..Oh, God yes! Thank you!(She kisses him)
NOBOYUKI: So, did anything happen while I was gone?
KIYONE: Well......
