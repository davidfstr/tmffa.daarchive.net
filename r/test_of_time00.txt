                         Prologue

                     Tenchi Muyo  OVA
                      A Test of Time

       Small fires fill the once beautiful designed room of the
Goddess’s chambers as signs of battle are show on the walls and floor
with massive craters and chard marks, as a war between the forces of
light and darkness carry on.
Ryoko seems to be slightly wounded as she presses her attack on D3 ending
his life as she cuts down through his red gem, but her victory is short
lived as she looks over to a badly beaten Tenchi as Z prepares to end his
life with one final attack.
“Tenchi! look out!......” she uses her own body as a shield in front of
him.
“Ryoko! No!” Tenchi yells as she leaps in front of him taking a
massive energy blast from Z, and shortly after she turns to Tenchi and
smiles before falling to the ground.
Tenchi quickly runs to her side holding her in his arms tears running down
his cheeks.
“Ryoko...why...why did you put my life before your own?”
She slowly reaches up putting a gentle hand to his cheek and forces a smile.
“Tenchi...without you I have no life nor would I want one without you
to share it with...*her hand slowly falls away from his cheek as she
fights to keep conscious as she feels herself slipping away*..I...I
love you..ten..chi. I only wish I could have found out how you truly
felt about....me....” her eyes slowly close as she uses what’s left of
her strength to hold him for the last time.
Tenchi gently pulls her close to him his tears falling to her face as he
whispers to her... “I love you Ryoko, I have for a long time now and your
actions here will not be in vain, I swear it.”
Ryoko slowly opens her eyes and her gaze meets his as they each slowly move
towards one anothers lips.
Just as their lips are about to meet another blast throws the two to the
side.
“Ahw did I interrupt anything? *Z snickers to himself knowing full well
what he’s done* Poor poor Ryoko, she’ll never know true love now will
she. *grins to himself as he looks to the now passed on Ryoko then to
Tenchi who is now in raged*
“You!...You Bastard! she loved life more than anyone I will ever know and
you took that from her....*his painful gaze cuts through Z’s* and now, now I
will take it from you Ahhhhhhhh!”
Tenchi dashes towards Z with a hate he never knew he had bringing up
his light hawk sword against Z’s over and over again as the two engage
in a battle that can only be described as beautiful.
Yet in another chamber another battle is being fought one of which could
alter the course of the universe forever, as three goddess fight with one
another.
The now adult Washu's eyes go wide with pain, as the mental link with her
daughter is cut painfully off.
“Ah my dear sister Washu I can feel your pain and what lovely pain it is."
Lady Tokimi circles around Washu with a half smile. "So I guess my Z was
successful in dealing with your precious Creation. *Lady Tokimi chuckles to
herself* Yes Im deeply sorry, it's a shame though about her killing my D3
before her death. I guess now I'll just have to find another. After I've
killed you all!” with a evil grin she quickly flys towards Washu to end her
life in her state of weakness over the lose of her daughter.
As she nears her she is pushed back by a wave of blue energy that came from
the now fused Sasami/Tsunami “Sister Washu I truly feel for the lose of
Ryoko your daughter I do, but if you die now our battle...her battle here
would all be for nothing. Sis....AAH!” Sasami/Tsunami is knocked into a wall
as wave after wave of dark energy slams into her. “Die sister die hahaha, I
will not lose to the likes of you or anyone.” Tears start to form in
Sasami/Tsunamis eyes as she feels her power draining from the on coming
attacks.
“Noooo!!” Washu plows into Lady Tokimi knocking her to the floor as she
slams her fist into her stomach over and over again “I will not let you win
Tokimi, I will not. Not after what you did to my child! My daughter Ryoko!”
Lady Tokimi's body fills with a gold light as she fires it onto Washu
knocking her off and hovers up into the air joining her sisters.
The three goddess eye one another before starting their battle again.
“Well boy, it seems you have more power than I thought, but will it even be
enough!” Z knocks Tenchi back with his shield throwing him off balance long
enough for him to score a hit, leaving a gash down Tenchi's arm, but the
power of the light hawk wings slowly start to heal him, and once again he is
ready to attack.
Tenchi summer salts up into the air over Z  trying to cut down his backside,
only to have his attack blocked by Z’s shield causing him to jump away from
Z.
“You’ll have to do better than that Tenchi, if you want to avenge your dear
little Ryoko hahaha!”
Tenchi hearing this pulls up one of the light hawk wings and holds it up in
front of his hands.  As Tenchi concentrates his power into it the other two
wings are absorbed into the first causing it glow brighter.
“Oh and what do you plan to do with that?!” Z smiles at the small looking
blast.
“My grandfather once told me to never let the size of the enemy fool you,
for their is always something the eyes can miss.” Tenchi rest his eyes as
the symbols on his forehead start to glow brightly, as does the energy from
the wing but remains the same size.
“HA! That only tells me your grandfather was a fool. Now! Die like he did at
my hands!” Z summons a huge mass of black energy and throws it towards
Tenchi and Tenchi seems to do the same with his.
As the two blast collide a blinding light fills the chamber where they
fight.
Z’s eyes go wide in shock as he reaches for his stomach only to find Tenchi
embedding the light hawk sword into him. “H..how did you get past
my...blast?..”
Tenchi twist the blade then pulls it out quickly letting Z fall to his
knees. “I wasn't forming a blast to attack you I was building the power to
my shield to reflect your blast, making you think they just collided and
destroyed one another.”
Z falls to his back his body racked with pain as Tenchi kneels down next to
him and speaks “You let your own misguided judgment tell you other wise, you
told yourself that you couldn't be beating and that was your weakness.”
Tenchi pulls up his sword to deal a quick finishing blow to a slowly
painfully dying Z.
As Tenchi's sword starts to comes down a blast rocks the back wall causing
him to turn his attention away from the dyeing Z.
Lady Tokimi screams out in rage as her two sister attack her together and
feeling her Z slipping away, she powers up all of her remaining power in to
one finial deadly attack. She pulls the dyeing Z into her self taking his
energy to build onto her own “HAHAHAHA!! No, NO! I will not lose. I will
not! Now you all DIE!!!!” She fires a very large blast towards her sisters.
The two sisters in turn do the same, summoning up all their power to stop
their sister.
A blinding light is formed as the energies of the goddess’s meet. Tenchi
seeing this wants only to help, even if he doesn't’t have the power of a
goddess, he still has the need to help, so he pulls up his light hawk wings
and charges head on into the mass of energy building in the room.
As Tenchi leaps into the air after Lady Tokimi she sweeps her hand across
the air forming a wave of dark energy that slams into Tenchi, knocking the
young man back towards the ground.
As Tenchi falls he forms his light hawk shield around him as Lady Tokimi
sends another dark wave into him knocking him back further towards the mass
of energy.
As he is consumed by the mass of energy formed by the three goddess “Tenchi
noooooo!.....” is the last thing he hears from two of the goddesses.
He is fully consumed into the energy and as he enters the sphere of power it
explodes.
Tenchi loses consensus, as darkness fills his mind, his last thoughts were
of Ryoko and how this was the end................................

*Sorry for the end but I wanted to make sure I could hook you into reading
